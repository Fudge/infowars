[00:00:05.418 --> 00:00:06.058]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.719 --> 00:00:07.779]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:09.600]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.121]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:12.702]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.402 --> 00:00:17.024]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.584 --> 00:00:21.666]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:33.915 --> 00:00:36.417]  We're blasting through the month of July.
[00:00:36.437 --> 00:00:43.161]  It is the 25th day of July 2005.
[00:00:43.602 --> 00:00:49.926]  On this Monday, we're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.308 --> 00:01:02.495]  And coming up later in the broadcast, we're going to have a little update from Paul Watson from England on all the new developments with the London bombing two and a half weeks ago.
[00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:13.326]  As well as what happened with the four bombs that magically didn't detonate, but their detonators did detonate.
[00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:25.355]  And then of course the innocent Brazilian man, no criminal record, never done anything wrong, being chased by the police, they sat on him and then gunned him down.
[00:01:27.495 --> 00:01:43.390]  Which tells me, because these are special forces, special branch police, plainclothes police being followed by Bobby's, that our friend from Brazil might not have just been an innocent bystander.
[00:01:44.911 --> 00:01:51.157]  He does have a little bit darker skin, could even pass as an Arab, though he's not an Arab, or a Muslim, or a Central Asian.
[00:01:53.064 --> 00:01:55.446]  And, uh, who knows what he was doing?
[00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.388]  Because, I mean, all I know is this.
[00:01:58.048 --> 00:02:17.985]  A lot of the people, the CIA contracts to carry out all sorts of events in Europe and in Latin America and in Iraq and in Texas and Arizona and in New Mexico and California, like Los Zetas and others, are Latin or EspaÃ±ol.
[00:02:18.726 --> 00:02:26.353]  Hispanic, whatever the term that different groups want to call different things, but the best thing is Latin American.
[00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:28.836]  Very suspicious.
[00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:38.805]  There's about 50 plus different indicators that make it suspicious and make the probability that this guy was one of their operatives and was dealt with.
[00:02:39.546 --> 00:02:42.309]  Now, I tell you up front when I'm speculating, but
[00:02:43.254 --> 00:02:44.395]  I'm leaning towards it.
[00:02:44.455 --> 00:02:51.299]  My snout, which is pretty accurate, I'm sure you've noticed, is smelling something.
[00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:59.483]  It is rotten, extremely effervescent in a negative context, and so we'll go over some of that.
[00:03:00.464 --> 00:03:07.948]  British police face shooting backlash, and Tony Blair comes up and says, it's really horrible, but
[00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:09.599]  There'll probably be more.
[00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:10.119]  I'm sorry.
[00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:13.940]  The police did an excellent job and we'll probably be shooting more people.
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.961]  Sorry?
[00:03:15.041 --> 00:03:16.821]  I mean, literally, I heard that on the radio this morning.
[00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.761]  I'm trying to find the club.
[00:03:18.481 --> 00:03:25.423]  But I heard the police chief on the radio, when I was out doing some errands early this morning, making excuses.
[00:03:25.503 --> 00:03:27.784]  Well, you know, he is totally innocent and we killed him.
[00:03:28.544 --> 00:03:29.624]  Totally innocent?
[00:03:30.924 --> 00:03:31.724]  Yeah, sure.
[00:03:31.784 --> 00:03:36.506]  You chase the guy down, sit on him and pump at least five rounds into him.
[00:03:36.546 --> 00:03:37.926]  It was an execution.
[00:03:40.262 --> 00:03:44.565]  And I don't believe the person was involved in a bombing, but he may have known too much.
[00:03:45.625 --> 00:03:48.987]  Something, lady, I mean, all these raids, trying to arrest people.
[00:03:49.388 --> 00:04:00.294]  Oh, by the way, now, not just one, last week it was one, of the supposed bombers, totally innocent, wrong person, wrong pitcher, totally made up.
[00:04:00.835 --> 00:04:02.016]  They got caught again, just like 9-11.
[00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:05.333]  Giving us fake pictures and fake names and fake lists.
[00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:07.394]  Now it looks like another one of the bombers.
[00:04:07.554 --> 00:04:10.476]  Oh no, it's actually somebody else.
[00:04:11.117 --> 00:04:11.757]  It's amazing.
[00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:17.341]  And don't ever forget those drills they had two weeks ago.
[00:04:17.922 --> 00:04:19.343]  Two weeks and what, four days?
[00:04:19.943 --> 00:04:22.065]  Right at the same time, exact same places.
[00:04:22.705 --> 00:04:25.707]  Oh and by the way, Channel 4 has attacked PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:04:27.088 --> 00:04:31.612]  And has attacked our analysis in a very shoddy, very shoddy fashion.
[00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:34.555]  So I'll spend a few minutes on that as well.
[00:04:34.675 --> 00:04:44.704]  And a lot of evidence coming out that, that, that, that photo of the four bombers getting on, you know, going into the train station, uh, it looks like it's doctored.
[00:04:45.384 --> 00:04:46.525]  The evidence shows that.
[00:04:46.585 --> 00:04:51.309]  I mean, these people are so, it's like a Fat Bin Laden in the room taking credit for 9-11, I mean.
[00:04:52.637 --> 00:04:54.138]  Voice print showed it wasn't him.
[00:04:54.638 --> 00:04:57.279]  Much less the fact that he had to gain 200 pounds.
[00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:58.839]  It's just incredible.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.341]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:09.983]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.103 --> 00:05:14.504]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.524 --> 00:05:15.845]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.645 --> 00:05:18.027]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.363 --> 00:05:41.830]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[00:06:30.587 --> 00:06:32.468]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[00:08:00.658 --> 00:08:05.681]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.082 --> 00:08:08.403]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.124 --> 00:08:12.966]  You know what?
[00:08:13.006 --> 00:08:21.371]  Let me just read... Let me just read a bunch of the headlines here in this 8-inch stack of news I've got in front of me.
[00:08:22.452 --> 00:08:25.434]  British Terror Police Face Shooting Backlash
[00:08:26.627 --> 00:08:35.594]  Bomb was under the train, says eyewitnesses closest to it, Cambridge Evening News, and a bunch of witnesses are now saying that.
[00:08:36.775 --> 00:08:38.176]  Bombs under the train.
[00:08:38.236 --> 00:08:40.457]  Bomb under the bus.
[00:08:41.018 --> 00:08:42.919]  You know, under one of the levels.
[00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:44.260]  Very suspicious.
[00:08:45.061 --> 00:08:48.063]  Also, photo of bombers has been doctored.
[00:08:48.763 --> 00:08:52.106]  Clear evidence that they've doctored these photos.
[00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:56.911]  Very shoddy job with the Photoshop.
[00:08:58.852 --> 00:09:02.353]  Also, more innocents could be shot, UK police say.
[00:09:02.714 --> 00:09:03.674]  They're openly saying.
[00:09:04.274 --> 00:09:11.197]  And it's not just that I have this out of the BBC and the Age and other major newspapers and publications and TV stations.
[00:09:11.257 --> 00:09:17.219]  I mean, I heard the police chief and Blair today on the radio, both of them, going, man, it's just terrible.
[00:09:17.919 --> 00:09:19.180]  And by the way, they're both named Blair.
[00:09:21.182 --> 00:09:29.368]  I heard both Blairs, the police chief and the prime minister, saying, well, it's just atrocious and horrible, but there may be more of it.
[00:09:29.388 --> 00:09:31.050]  Can you say if you know?
[00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:34.192]  So more innocents could be shot!
[00:09:35.613 --> 00:09:43.279]  Blair to leave way open for recall of the House of Commons, who passed all these draconian anti-terror pieces of legislation.
[00:09:43.934 --> 00:09:48.617]  Like his national ID card and so, so much more!
[00:09:49.117 --> 00:09:53.840]  It's like last week they used the latest wave of bombings.
[00:09:54.681 --> 00:10:04.247]  There was even the dud bombs that blew up on trains and buses just last Thursday again on 7-21.
[00:10:04.267 --> 00:10:04.767]  14 days after 7-7.
[00:10:08.183 --> 00:10:14.370]  And then magically they got the Patriot Act rammed in for another 10 years.
[00:10:15.511 --> 00:10:16.672]  And then here's some of the other news.
[00:10:17.393 --> 00:10:20.256]  Oh, Americans say World War III likely.
[00:10:20.776 --> 00:10:22.518]  And then they give all their reasons for it.
[00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:28.945]  A newspaper claims former DOJ officials confirm bombing cover-ups.
[00:10:29.747 --> 00:10:33.110]  This was, of course, on KTOK-TV.
[00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:38.654]  We posted this back a week and a half ago on July 14th.
[00:10:39.894 --> 00:10:47.140]  And this is where we have these memos given to some of the people doing FOIA requests.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:55.346]  Some of these internal FBI memos were left on some of the FOIA documents that were released and buried in these hard drives.
[00:10:56.318 --> 00:11:06.961]  And, uh, well, now this has come out that they did indeed know about the plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah building, but nothing was done about it.
[00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:10.423]  But, notice that the FBI released these documents.
[00:11:11.483 --> 00:11:17.165]  And, uh, the fingers are all pointing at white supremacists at Elohim City.
[00:11:18.725 --> 00:11:24.487]  Well, we said look out for this because this has happened over and over again.
[00:11:26.175 --> 00:11:29.157]  What, I made a film three and a half years ago called Road to Tyranny.
[00:11:29.738 --> 00:11:30.838]  Still one of my best films.
[00:11:31.259 --> 00:11:33.940]  Covers 9-11, Oklahoma City, the whole police state.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:46.328]  But in the 44 minute Oklahoma City section of the film, a documentary on its own, we talk about how it was really Iraqis in the employ of the U.S.
[00:11:46.428 --> 00:11:48.429]  government, and we have the admissions of that,
[00:11:49.492 --> 00:11:52.193]  And that's why they won't release the surveillance camera tapes.
[00:11:52.213 --> 00:11:54.594]  Because it doesn't show Andre Schroesmeier.
[00:11:55.195 --> 00:12:02.878]  It doesn't show anybody from Elohim City and the white supremacist, federally controlled compound, which admittedly, you know, a federal operation.
[00:12:02.898 --> 00:12:04.839]  It doesn't show any of that.
[00:12:06.079 --> 00:12:11.362]  What it clearly shows is McVeigh with the Iraqis.
[00:12:12.262 --> 00:12:15.063]  Then people say, well, wait a minute, then that shows Saddam did it.
[00:12:15.283 --> 00:12:16.304]  Ah, ah, ah!
[00:12:16.969 --> 00:12:19.469]  These were Iraqis working for the U.S.
[00:12:19.549 --> 00:12:20.070]  government.
[00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:24.570]  That was even admitted by the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Times.
[00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:25.771]  And we have those in the film.
[00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:30.611]  So what you have is what Morris Dees tried from the start.
[00:12:31.092 --> 00:12:40.013]  Now people have used these memos and other memos that have come out to show that the Southern Poverty Law Center did indeed know about the plans weeks before.
[00:12:41.413 --> 00:12:42.814]  And that's been out for about a year.
[00:12:44.995 --> 00:13:00.984]  And so by the mere fact of all these memos and documents, there's several of them, this is just the newest, showing government prior knowledge and showing that the Southern Poverty Law Center also knew, people are now kind of using their own propaganda against them and going, okay, well you knew then, why didn't you do anything?
[00:13:01.044 --> 00:13:06.067]  But still, it shows this attempted trail leading it back to white supremacists.
[00:13:06.107 --> 00:13:07.988]  And again, I'm not defending white supremacists.
[00:13:08.808 --> 00:13:12.431]  But the general public doesn't know the difference, at least back in the mid-90s,
[00:13:13.894 --> 00:13:19.839]  Doesn't know the difference between somebody who's for the Second Amendment and somebody who is for, you know, lynching black people.
[00:13:20.500 --> 00:13:21.741]  That's your controlled media.
[00:13:21.761 --> 00:13:22.621]  That's what they've done.
[00:13:23.062 --> 00:13:24.503]  Is, oh, you're for property rights.
[00:13:24.543 --> 00:13:27.225]  Well, you must be a secret Klan member.
[00:13:27.485 --> 00:13:30.208]  I mean, the Justice Department even teaches this.
[00:13:30.248 --> 00:13:33.390]  Well, if you talk about the Federal Reserve, that's a code word.
[00:13:33.871 --> 00:13:35.452]  Well, Milton Friedman talks about it.
[00:13:36.665 --> 00:13:37.986]  And how corrupt and bad it is.
[00:13:38.066 --> 00:13:41.589]  Is Milton Friedman the Nobel Prize winner?
[00:13:41.609 --> 00:13:42.610]  Is he Jewish?
[00:13:42.670 --> 00:13:44.031]  Is he anti-Semitic?
[00:13:44.251 --> 00:13:45.272]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[00:13:45.993 --> 00:13:49.116]  And so, they wanted to burn the right wing in America.
[00:13:49.636 --> 00:13:52.839]  They wanted to blame this on Patriot groups and Second Amendment groups.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:54.481]  And they almost had their way.
[00:13:56.005 --> 00:14:23.648]  And so we'll be uh... we'll be deciphering this with a police officer, police detective Colonel Craig Roberts who worked the Oklahoma City case and who about five years ago on this broadcast uh... warned me about certain individuals putting out this disinfo and boy does it uh... if the shoe fits wear it it uh... it certainly has played out that way so we'll we'll break all that down coming up in the next hour
[00:14:24.893 --> 00:14:33.596]  Massive flu outbreak could happen at any time, any moment, WHO warns.
[00:14:35.156 --> 00:14:46.600]  And they've been fear mongering about this for years, and they're really beating the drum even harder, getting the tempo of the drum beat stronger, kind of leading towards a crescendo.
[00:14:48.448 --> 00:15:01.901]  And it'd be very easy for the globalists to release a deadly flu and use the carnage as the smokescreen, as the pretext, as the excuse, to really put in a martial law control system.
[00:15:02.402 --> 00:15:03.923]  You go, well why would they do that?
[00:15:03.983 --> 00:15:05.805]  Well, because they want power and control.
[00:15:06.105 --> 00:15:07.607]  That's the norm in human history.
[00:15:08.326 --> 00:15:10.688]  And how do we know they're going to do that?
[00:15:11.048 --> 00:15:12.950]  How do we know that's where everything is trending?
[00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:19.735]  Because they've been preparing their every move, their every operation, their every construction, their every machination.
[00:15:20.216 --> 00:15:20.776]  Forge that!
[00:15:20.856 --> 00:15:21.857]  We have our own documents.
[00:15:23.018 --> 00:15:26.261]  Attacks on UK will continue, Radical Cleric says.
[00:15:27.442 --> 00:15:30.624]  And I love how they leave this guy in London and let him shoot his mouth off.
[00:15:31.045 --> 00:15:34.828]  Again, they have to have somebody who plays the part of the bad man
[00:15:36.262 --> 00:15:44.446]  But meanwhile, here in the United States, from New York to San Francisco, police aim machine guns at five-year-old children.
[00:15:44.826 --> 00:15:47.688]  They search people's bags, supposedly randomly.
[00:15:48.648 --> 00:15:55.172]  But literally, folks, we've got the reports pouring in, and I've seen all the video and photos on TV.
[00:15:56.372 --> 00:15:58.513]  Basically, if you've got a turban, you're fine.
[00:15:59.094 --> 00:15:59.814]  With a big bag.
[00:16:00.549 --> 00:16:05.092]  Literally, because we can't profile as if there's anything to profile for to begin with.
[00:16:05.132 --> 00:16:09.875]  This is all staged, but even if you buy there, ooh, there's a terror threat that shows how it's a fraud.
[00:16:10.115 --> 00:16:21.583]  The border's wide open and the guys with the giant turbans, I've seen this on planes, people with turbans, people with hoods over their heads, women with their faces covered, they go right on, but oh, look at you!
[00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:26.338]  Look at you, a white guy with blue eyes!
[00:16:26.538 --> 00:16:31.481]  We're going to need to take those shoes off and we're going to need to ask you some questions, boy.
[00:16:32.041 --> 00:16:35.263]  You may be without a cut.
[00:16:35.283 --> 00:16:40.986]  I mean, look, it's about training the public that you're a bunch of slaves.
[00:16:41.706 --> 00:16:43.828]  I mean, it's just that simple.
[00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:45.448]  It has nothing to do with terror.
[00:16:45.629 --> 00:16:48.230]  I know people are outraged by that.
[00:16:49.102 --> 00:16:55.107]  And if you think that's bad, look at this article out of the Associated Press, and it doesn't get any sicker than this.
[00:16:56.528 --> 00:16:57.749]  Pressured on U.S.
[00:16:58.189 --> 00:17:00.411]  to use more surveillance.
[00:17:01.351 --> 00:17:15.582]  Pressure is building for greater use of video cameras to keep watch over the nation's cities, particularly in transportation systems and other spots vulnerable to terrorism after the bombings in London.
[00:17:16.303 --> 00:17:30.906]  The calls have come over the last few weeks as British investigators release surveillance footage of the bombers in the deadly July 7th attacks and then put out frames of suspects in Thursday's failed attacks.
[00:17:32.521 --> 00:17:34.362]  And the evidence shows the doctor trains.
[00:17:35.002 --> 00:17:35.362]  I don't.
[00:17:36.023 --> 00:17:42.326]  I do not think that the cameras are the big, mortal threat to civil liberties that people are painting them to be.
[00:17:42.686 --> 00:17:43.606]  Washington, D.C.
[00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:46.508]  Mayor Anthony A. Williams said Friday.
[00:17:46.908 --> 00:17:48.489]  Someone who supports total gun bans.
[00:17:49.105 --> 00:17:49.945]  He's not alone.
[00:17:50.025 --> 00:18:04.651]  While privacy advocates question their effectiveness, Senator Hillary Clinton called for New York City subway officials to install more cameras even though officials said some 5,000 cameras are already in use across all modes of city travel.
[00:18:05.231 --> 00:18:06.712]  In Stamford, Connecticut,
[00:18:07.975 --> 00:18:17.142]  Mayor Dan Malloy said it's time to revisit a 1999 ordinance that limited cameras for watching traffic.
[00:18:17.543 --> 00:18:21.666]  In many other spots around the country, cameras are already in place.
[00:18:22.207 --> 00:18:24.649]  In general, I think we're getting used to cameras, he said.
[00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:31.214]  That's just the way the world is, said Roy, who runs an Orlando, Florida-based security design consulting firm.
[00:18:31.952 --> 00:18:33.933]  Boy, all they want is people that are positive.
[00:18:33.973 --> 00:18:37.314]  So they go to big city mayors, big crime machine mayors.
[00:18:37.774 --> 00:18:41.656]  They go to guys who sell surveillance cameras.
[00:18:41.856 --> 00:18:42.636]  It's disgusting.
[00:18:43.017 --> 00:18:44.197]  Okay, let's just stop right there.
[00:18:45.278 --> 00:18:50.180]  My parents just got back from London, and they said it was almost like it was a joke.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.141]  I tried to get my dad to come on the show.
[00:18:53.181 --> 00:18:53.701]  He won't do it.
[00:18:53.721 --> 00:18:54.241]  He doesn't want to.
[00:18:55.522 --> 00:18:59.103]  He does not like being out in the media.
[00:18:59.563 --> 00:19:00.784]  But to make a long story short,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:06.182]  He said they actually have stickers everywhere with all seeing eyes looking at you.
[00:19:06.802 --> 00:19:14.606]  We posted the photos, you know, of these big street posters that say, safe under the watchful eyes, and there's the Illuminati eye looking at you.
[00:19:15.206 --> 00:19:21.510]  But he said, and he got photos of these, I've got to go over to his house and get some of these off his digital cameras.
[00:19:21.550 --> 00:19:24.371]  He said he took like a thousand photos and put them on the web.
[00:19:25.712 --> 00:19:30.554]  It'll show a black helicopter beaming something at you with a camera.
[00:19:31.969 --> 00:19:33.429]  And you're being watched!
[00:19:33.569 --> 00:19:34.530]  It doesn't say by who.
[00:19:34.810 --> 00:19:36.290]  See, these stickers are everywhere.
[00:19:36.770 --> 00:19:38.311]  Black helicopter stickers.
[00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:41.051]  So, just in your face.
[00:19:41.691 --> 00:19:48.473]  Of course, in 1984, the book opens in the first 20 pages with black helicopters looking through your walls.
[00:19:48.693 --> 00:19:52.794]  So, I guess that they're the home of black helicopters, even in fiction.
[00:19:54.014 --> 00:19:55.755]  The birthplace of the black helicopter.
[00:19:56.135 --> 00:19:57.135]  Airstrip One.
[00:19:57.175 --> 00:19:57.715]  We'll be back.

[00:21:00.985 --> 00:21:01.745]  Terrorism!
[00:21:01.885 --> 00:21:02.646]  Terrorism!
[00:21:02.746 --> 00:21:08.808]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!

[00:21:13.770 --> 00:21:28.335]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:28.375 --> 00:21:28.695]  government.

[00:24:07.003 --> 00:24:09.765]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:09.785 --> 00:24:14.407]  Alright, John and Jeff and William, all of your calls are coming up.
[00:24:14.427 --> 00:24:14.607]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:14.647 --> 00:24:20.350]  I want to get into all the fear-mongering over mega-flu, millions why billions could die,
[00:24:31.639 --> 00:24:34.420]  We'll tell you how to give your rights up tonight at ten!
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.562]  That's basically how the propaganda has been playing out.
[00:24:39.102 --> 00:24:48.345]  And also, just so many new things have come out proving that these bombings in London are government false flag inside job operations.
[00:24:49.946 --> 00:24:54.548]  But getting back to the aftermath here, I mean, imagine what our ancestors would think of us.
[00:24:55.728 --> 00:24:59.910]  Oh, there's one chance out of, you know, two hundred and something million
[00:25:00.771 --> 00:25:06.255]  That I might die in a car bomb, or a bus bomb, or a plane might fly into me.
[00:25:07.095 --> 00:25:14.780]  And so because there's a threat, I don't want any freedoms, and I'll give up my entire birthright, and search me, and take my liberties.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.323]  And then they have these articles, I mean there's...
[00:25:20.703 --> 00:25:26.946]  I think we posted like five different articles this weekend on PrisonPlanet.com where it was, you know, headlines.
[00:25:27.326 --> 00:25:29.107]  Being surveilled is good.
[00:25:29.167 --> 00:25:30.888]  Americans want more cameras.
[00:25:31.228 --> 00:25:33.630]  Americans love being searched.
[00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:34.950]  It's just fabulous.
[00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:36.551]  No one is against it.
[00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:39.993]  I actually have articles right here on the stack where everyone loves it.
[00:25:40.313 --> 00:25:41.334]  No one's complaining.
[00:25:41.654 --> 00:25:44.595]  Oh, it's so good that everybody I talk to hates it.
[00:25:44.615 --> 00:25:45.716]  People on the street hate it.
[00:25:47.136 --> 00:25:47.977]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:25:48.959 --> 00:25:53.283]  So the propaganda is there to make you feel like, well the majority loves this, I better like it.
[00:25:53.783 --> 00:25:54.904]  Pressure on U.S.
[00:25:54.944 --> 00:25:56.405]  to use more surveillance.
[00:25:56.425 --> 00:26:10.838]  I mean the federal government, just this year, you know, billion two for New York, 800 million for Boston, 500 and something million federal grant for cameras in Chicago, hundreds of millions in Dallas, tens of millions in Austin.
[00:26:11.593 --> 00:26:15.815]  I mean, we've had... Folks, there are now cameras in our neighborhoods in Austin, Texas.
[00:26:16.135 --> 00:26:20.437]  Four-way stops, literally, in one of the worst towns that don't even have a gas station.
[00:26:21.017 --> 00:26:27.660]  In fact, I've seen four-way stops out in the country where there's nothing, but cow pastures on all four sides.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.541]  They want to know where you're going, what you're doing.
[00:26:31.841 --> 00:26:35.483]  Those cameras hook into systems that have softwares that scan your license plate.
[00:26:35.803 --> 00:26:37.284]  They know exactly who you are.
[00:26:39.605 --> 00:26:40.465]  Folks, London
[00:26:41.698 --> 00:26:46.901]  Has four and a half million, and this is last year's numbers, I haven't checked lately.
[00:26:47.001 --> 00:26:49.042]  It grows by like a million every year.
[00:26:49.842 --> 00:26:54.264]  Four and a half million surveillance cameras.
[00:26:55.705 --> 00:26:57.906]  Four and a half million.
[00:26:58.326 --> 00:27:05.170]  Out of those four and a half million surveillance cameras, what is it, like 90% of them are the government's?
[00:27:05.230 --> 00:27:08.611]  Because that's not even counting some of the private cameras.
[00:27:08.731 --> 00:27:09.792]  So it's over four and a half million.
[00:27:11.974 --> 00:27:17.077]  And so the question is, do you, are you more worried about a tyrannical government?
[00:27:18.198 --> 00:27:22.100]  Having total surveillance, a total grid of control?
[00:27:23.821 --> 00:27:26.142]  Or are you more worried about the average street thug?
[00:27:28.544 --> 00:27:32.266]  I mean, do you trust the government to use these cameras properly?
[00:27:32.306 --> 00:27:33.306]  And the answer is no.
[00:27:34.807 --> 00:27:37.749]  Let's say Tony Blair is a wonderful little angel, which he's not.
[00:27:38.729 --> 00:27:41.211]  I mean, he might be an angel, but if he's an angel it's Beelzebub.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:42.940]  A fallen angel.
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:44.561]  Bush might be an angel.
[00:27:44.581 --> 00:27:47.322]  I mean, again, Skull and Bones may be really a Christian organization.
[00:27:47.342 --> 00:27:48.622]  Maybe I've been wrong all these years.
[00:27:49.322 --> 00:27:52.063]  But, what happens when you get a Hillary Clinton?
[00:27:52.083 --> 00:27:54.624]  Or what happens when you get somebody who's worse?
[00:27:55.384 --> 00:28:08.287]  And now, there have been a lot of would-be dictators throughout history that never got to become dictators in this country, never got to become dictators in other countries, because they didn't have the mechanisms or the large enough force of thugs to carry out their aims.
[00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:10.788]  You just had corrupt government.
[00:28:11.488 --> 00:28:12.849]  But they couldn't get control of everything.
[00:28:13.170 --> 00:28:29.305]  But you give them national ID cards, and cameras, and RFID tracker chips, and surveillance blimps, and surveillance helicopters, and militarized, gung-ho, brainwashed, black ski mask wearing cops who'll just kill somebody because they're scared and stumble.
[00:28:31.252 --> 00:28:33.615]  You got a recipe for tyranny.
[00:28:33.856 --> 00:28:35.838]  Now obviously Tony Blair is totally evil.
[00:28:36.299 --> 00:28:38.081]  Obviously George Bush is totally evil.
[00:28:38.442 --> 00:28:40.384]  Obviously Hillary Clinton is totally evil.
[00:28:40.584 --> 00:28:48.335]  And their masters, the Henry Kissingers and the George Shultz of the world are totally reprobate, totally wicked, totally on power trips.
[00:28:49.406 --> 00:28:50.606]  Openly, they're building camps.
[00:28:50.786 --> 00:28:53.247]  Openly, they're taking our freedoms while leaving our borders wide open.
[00:28:53.667 --> 00:28:56.168]  They are openly dismantling the Constitutional Bill of Rights.
[00:28:56.388 --> 00:29:07.111]  They are openly bid-rigging and government contracts sucking in the hundreds of billions of dollars, and they're openly involved, clearly, in people dying in massive numbers.
[00:29:08.912 --> 00:29:14.873]  So, I mean, you've got classical tyranny in front of you, and the tyrants are doing everything a tyrant would do.
[00:29:14.893 --> 00:29:17.594]  It's like these people are would-be Ceausescus or something.
[00:29:19.873 --> 00:29:25.556]  And so, um, you know, you read these articles, oh, it's so wonderful, we want to be searched!
[00:29:26.216 --> 00:29:28.057]  We know you all want to be searched.
[00:29:28.077 --> 00:29:30.519]  We're trying our hardest to satisfy you.
[00:29:31.239 --> 00:29:32.640]  No one has complained.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:34.141]  Everyone loves it.
[00:29:34.841 --> 00:29:36.402]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:29:36.722 --> 00:29:38.423]  Oh, it's so great.
[00:29:40.299 --> 00:29:41.900]  Why don't you put some cameras on the border?
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:44.341]  Why don't you do some bag searches on the border?
[00:29:44.721 --> 00:29:50.363]  Why don't you... No, you're not going to do that because that's part of turning America into a third world cesspit!
[00:29:51.504 --> 00:29:52.444]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.885 --> 00:29:54.525]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.406 --> 00:29:58.087]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.192 --> 00:30:02.893]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:30:03.073 --> 00:30:05.094]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:30:05.294 --> 00:30:05.974]  Prepare yourself.
[00:30:06.154 --> 00:30:09.856]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[00:30:09.996 --> 00:30:15.739]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book, The Bible Says, for free.
[00:30:15.779 --> 00:30:17.180]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:19.961]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[00:30:20.101 --> 00:30:21.662]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[00:30:21.902 --> 00:30:24.743]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[00:30:24.803 --> 00:30:25.544]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:30:30.826 --> 00:30:34.427]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[00:30:34.607 --> 00:30:38.528]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[00:30:38.668 --> 00:30:42.169]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:50.151]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[00:30:50.391 --> 00:30:53.671]  Keep it clean and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[00:30:54.112 --> 00:30:57.752]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[00:30:58.012 --> 00:30:59.833]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[00:31:00.879 --> 00:31:02.840]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:13.663]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.023 --> 00:31:18.544]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.624 --> 00:31:29.947]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.547 --> 00:31:37.392]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.792 --> 00:31:39.933]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.414 --> 00:31:45.397]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:31:45.697 --> 00:31:52.002]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.082 --> 00:31:56.244]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you!
[00:31:56.484 --> 00:31:57.245]  That's toll free!
[00:31:57.265 --> 00:31:57.305]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:10.057]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:32:10.317 --> 00:32:12.660]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.882]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:32:15.222 --> 00:32:20.588]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:32:20.948 --> 00:32:21.649]  We're good to go.
[00:32:41.361 --> 00:32:44.522]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:32:44.742 --> 00:32:47.223]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.

[00:32:54.025 --> 00:32:56.365]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:32:56.465 --> 00:32:58.666]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:32:59.226 --> 00:33:05.528]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[00:33:08.251 --> 00:33:10.612]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:12.072 --> 00:33:24.116]  I'll tell you what, let's just go to your calls now because we got a guest coming up and we'll take some calls while Colonel Roberts is with us.
[00:33:24.136 --> 00:33:26.297]  We'll be talking about stuff all over the map.
[00:33:26.617 --> 00:33:27.377]  Great friend of mine.
[00:33:28.358 --> 00:33:29.818]  Excellent political mind.
[00:33:29.838 --> 00:33:31.439]  Great investigator.
[00:33:31.479 --> 00:33:32.499]  I mean, that's what he does.
[00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:43.632]  And he'll be joining us to talk about these new supposed Oklahoma City developments that so many people are fawning over and drooling over.
[00:33:45.472 --> 00:33:46.972]  That's coming up.
[00:33:47.892 --> 00:33:49.533]  We know the Feds knew about it.
[00:33:49.613 --> 00:33:50.493]  They did it.
[00:33:51.233 --> 00:33:53.613]  It isn't a sting gone bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:54.694 --> 00:33:55.514]  I'm so tired of it.
[00:33:55.734 --> 00:33:59.194]  We cook the bomb and train the driver in the First World Trade Center.
[00:33:59.254 --> 00:33:59.814]  They admit it.
[00:34:00.115 --> 00:34:02.675]  And then we just accidentally let them do it.
[00:34:04.199 --> 00:34:07.241]  Those fools didn't park it up against the column like we trained them to do!
[00:34:09.983 --> 00:34:11.945]  Thank God they didn't do that, FBI.
[00:34:11.965 --> 00:34:13.766]  I mean, that's admitted.
[00:34:13.786 --> 00:34:19.170]  It's the same thing with Oklahoma City, but even worse.
[00:34:19.190 --> 00:34:20.791]  It's pretty sick.
[00:34:22.912 --> 00:34:29.397]  They hire well-meaning people and tell them it's part of a drill, and then they take them out and they blow them up for real.
[00:34:30.778 --> 00:34:31.779]  Sayonara!
[00:34:32.751 --> 00:34:34.072]  Buen viaje!
[00:34:34.512 --> 00:34:35.532]  Vaya con Dios!
[00:34:36.573 --> 00:34:37.673]  Hasta luego!
[00:34:37.693 --> 00:34:40.374]  Alright, that's enough.
[00:34:42.695 --> 00:34:46.877]  I'll tell you, it's on days like these that, I mean, my head's spinning.
[00:34:46.917 --> 00:34:48.137]  There's just so much here.
[00:34:50.078 --> 00:34:53.240]  So much here that needs to be covered.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.381]  But we'll just go ahead and go to your calls and then I'll jump in too.
[00:34:57.290 --> 00:35:08.203]  British Terror Police face shooting backlash, but Tony Blair and the Police Chief, the other Blair, Ian Blair, oh, there's going to be more probably.
[00:35:08.343 --> 00:35:08.923]  Sorry.
[00:35:09.564 --> 00:35:10.585]  License to kill.
[00:35:10.605 --> 00:35:13.268]  You know why they're saying there's going to be more?
[00:35:13.288 --> 00:35:17.693]  Because they're hunting down people that were obviously decoys that
[00:35:18.979 --> 00:35:24.545]  That got wise to what happened, and we have evidence that... There's a bunch of different points on that, but we'll get into it a little bit later.
[00:35:24.865 --> 00:35:27.327]  They're happy to tell you, oh, there'll be more people we've got to kill!
[00:35:28.208 --> 00:35:28.629]  More!
[00:35:29.490 --> 00:35:30.010]  Sorry!
[00:35:30.991 --> 00:35:34.194]  And, uh, again, more innocents could be shot, UK police say!
[00:35:35.455 --> 00:35:42.863]  And so we'll get into that, and, uh... Eyewitnesses are reporting on the bus and in the trains, bombs blowing up through the floor!
[00:35:44.761 --> 00:35:49.823]  Oh, but the police tried to stop the media from getting up close video of the buses and they pulled those off.
[00:35:50.523 --> 00:35:53.264]  The place is still surveilled with canvas all over it.
[00:35:54.924 --> 00:35:56.524]  So you can't see what's in it.
[00:35:58.065 --> 00:36:02.566]  But the eyewitnesses are saying the blast came from beneath them.
[00:36:04.227 --> 00:36:06.447]  Oh no, it was suicide bombers.
[00:36:07.308 --> 00:36:08.668]  On the buses, they did.
[00:36:09.591 --> 00:36:16.996]  Well, there may have been people with rucksacks on board the buses and the evidence shows they thought they were part of the drill or were carrying something.
[00:36:17.396 --> 00:36:21.278]  And by the way, we said this four days before Scotland Yard said it.
[00:36:21.959 --> 00:36:25.661]  Because all of Scotland Yard is not evil, you know, involved in the terrorism.
[00:36:25.701 --> 00:36:28.303]  Most of them are good cops and smart people.
[00:36:28.323 --> 00:36:31.425]  And they're going, this just doesn't fit the M.O.
[00:36:31.505 --> 00:36:34.807]  on these guys, their histories, how the explosions took place.
[00:36:37.128 --> 00:36:38.269]  None of this makes sense.
[00:36:40.512 --> 00:36:46.056]  And then the police listed like ten different indicators of why, and we've written articles about that.
[00:36:48.518 --> 00:37:00.546]  But if you really want to understand why governments carry out terrorism, who has the motive, the history of this, just a whole bunch of different key examples of it, it's just fascinating and also horrifying.
[00:37:01.807 --> 00:37:03.928]  You need to get 9-11 on the road to tyranny.
[00:37:04.008 --> 00:37:06.390]  Still the preeminent, the classic,
[00:37:07.003 --> 00:37:11.964]  The definitive, you know, made what, four months, five months after 9-11.
[00:37:12.004 --> 00:37:16.545]  I mean, I started making that sucker right after 9-11 and released it four or five months after 9-11.
[00:37:17.166 --> 00:37:18.686]  And it is almost three hours long.
[00:37:18.746 --> 00:37:20.686]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terror.
[00:37:21.227 --> 00:37:26.208]  Then it gets into World Trade Center One, Oklahoma City, and then 9-11.
[00:37:26.908 --> 00:37:30.949]  And then we show the police state they're going to set up and show their master plan globally.
[00:37:31.678 --> 00:37:40.400]  And I was just watching the film the other day, again, because it was on local TV, and I tuned in and watched, like, the last 30 minutes, and everything we talk about has now come true.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:41.041]  It's happening.
[00:37:41.581 --> 00:37:42.921]  And people don't want to believe you out there.
[00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:45.962]  Give them Roteturning and go, okay, this was made almost four years ago.
[00:37:46.082 --> 00:37:46.962]  Three and a half years ago.
[00:37:47.942 --> 00:37:48.142]  Here.
[00:37:48.863 --> 00:37:51.503]  You know, 90% of the film is what had already happened, or about 80%.
[00:37:52.084 --> 00:37:57.485]  Then 20% is what's going to happen, and what they're setting up, and boy, it's like a time machine or something.
[00:37:58.135 --> 00:38:06.220]  And it's not again that I've got some giant cranium that has to be supported by handlers, and I'm so smart.
[00:38:06.721 --> 00:38:14.866]  I'm just somebody who sees straight and knows a scam when I see it, and understands human nature, and I happen to have read a lot of history.
[00:38:15.407 --> 00:38:18.048]  And I happen to have been studying the globalists for over a decade.
[00:38:19.049 --> 00:38:22.311]  And so we understand their actions.
[00:38:23.032 --> 00:38:27.495]  I mean, it's been pointed out, and we do have those clips, that I said in the last six months, I said,
[00:38:29.084 --> 00:38:35.548]  Summer, look for some warm-up attacks, probably on trains and buses in London.
[00:38:37.049 --> 00:38:39.391]  And again, there's a hundred reasons I said that.
[00:38:40.391 --> 00:38:42.793]  You know, we call it a hunch, but it isn't a hunch.
[00:38:43.373 --> 00:38:46.315]  It's just all these different indicators.
[00:38:46.955 --> 00:38:56.421]  Again, it's like trying... If somebody said, hey, have you ever been to the Smoky Mountains and stood on, you know, Mount whatever, and seen how beautiful it is up above the town?
[00:38:57.504 --> 00:38:59.025]  And, uh, yeah, I've been there.
[00:38:59.085 --> 00:39:00.386]  Well, describe it for me.
[00:39:00.466 --> 00:39:01.747]  Well, it's indescribable.
[00:39:01.827 --> 00:39:22.481]  I mean, I, all I can, you know, say is, as well as these big snow-covered peaks with big pine trees down beneath it with snow on the ground and, and, and, and the fog rolling, the mist, and, you know, the little town, the way it's painted, the little red churches and, you know, or red firehouses and white churches and, and, and little cars driving down below.
[00:39:22.501 --> 00:39:24.603]  I mean, I cannot describe the picture.
[00:39:25.982 --> 00:39:26.983]  I mean, I tried to.
[00:39:27.003 --> 00:39:38.089]  I tried to, you know, explain how I can get on the air and go, they're going to use Bin Laden as the Patsy, they're going to attack the World Trade Centers in the next two months, call the White House, tell them don't carry out the attacks.
[00:39:39.169 --> 00:39:40.310]  You know, I don't make a lot of predictions.
[00:39:40.970 --> 00:39:46.914]  Or when I get up here and say, well, you know, somebody called in and was going, I think they're going to nuke us in the next two months and we're all dead.
[00:39:46.934 --> 00:39:52.997]  And I said, no, before that happens, they'll probably bomb some trains and buses in London.
[00:39:54.145 --> 00:39:55.926]  And, okay, why would they do that?
[00:39:56.767 --> 00:39:59.308]  Because I've read a lot of news chatter and indicators.
[00:39:59.348 --> 00:40:02.510]  The globalists love to prepare us beforehand.
[00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.351]  They like to warm you up.
[00:40:05.112 --> 00:40:05.552]  Okay?
[00:40:06.252 --> 00:40:08.314]  It's like Jim Jones and Kool-Aid drills.
[00:40:08.634 --> 00:40:10.115]  What do you do when the terrorists attack?
[00:40:10.215 --> 00:40:11.155]  Give your rights up!
[00:40:11.536 --> 00:40:12.616]  Everybody repeat after me.
[00:40:12.957 --> 00:40:14.597]  What do you do when the terrorists attack?
[00:40:14.878 --> 00:40:16.138]  Give our rights up!
[00:40:16.279 --> 00:40:16.839]  Good!
[00:40:17.159 --> 00:40:18.920]  Now, Al-Qaeda's going to hit London.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:21.842]  They're going to hit the subways and they're going to do this and
[00:40:23.283 --> 00:40:26.945]  The British people were saying no to the National ID Card, no to the Euro.
[00:40:27.505 --> 00:40:31.828]  All these things are happening, and so... And there's like a hundred other indicators.
[00:40:32.668 --> 00:40:33.689]  I can't go over all of them.
[00:40:33.709 --> 00:40:39.572]  I can't describe, you know, the whole... I could write a book, I guess, about one subject and describe, you know, how this works.
[00:40:39.672 --> 00:40:42.193]  But it's probabilities.
[00:40:42.333 --> 00:40:43.494]  It's what an analyst does.
[00:40:45.015 --> 00:40:48.497]  And let me just give you this analysis.
[00:40:49.867 --> 00:40:57.509]  If we do not expose who's behind the terror, it is clear that the globalists are heating back up again for something really big.
[00:40:57.569 --> 00:41:04.791]  They've got that greedy look in their eye, they've got that excited look in their eye, they've got that smirk that they're trying to hold back.
[00:41:05.491 --> 00:41:14.274]  All the big major players, all the big major puppet underlords of the overlords, all these supposed top politicians are just puppets.
[00:41:15.514 --> 00:41:18.315]  But they're powerful puppets who've been energized and who are
[00:41:19.449 --> 00:41:20.390]  Moving the levers.
[00:41:21.671 --> 00:41:25.293]  But they, again, sing to someone's tune.
[00:41:26.294 --> 00:41:26.914]  Follow orders.
[00:41:27.314 --> 00:41:30.517]  But I'm seeing that greedy evil, that vampiric lust for death.
[00:41:31.537 --> 00:41:41.904]  I'm seeing the same fritting and skittering by them, and like a pack of rats, greedily going after a piece of cheese that's been dropped on the floor.
[00:41:44.866 --> 00:41:46.808]  So, it doesn't look good.
[00:41:47.568 --> 00:41:48.309]  That's all I can say.
[00:41:49.216 --> 00:41:51.637]  I mean, they may pull something really big.
[00:41:52.338 --> 00:41:56.200]  And you know, usually I pooh-pooh that when callers call in and go, they're going to get us any minute.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:01.663]  Next Tuesday we're going to be hit by, you know, Silesian spacecraft.
[00:42:03.064 --> 00:42:06.686]  Or next month Planet X will smash us and kill us all.
[00:42:06.746 --> 00:42:07.586]  It's all over.
[00:42:08.847 --> 00:42:10.048]  Buy my Planet X book.
[00:42:12.169 --> 00:42:13.970]  You know, I stay away from all that.
[00:42:14.938 --> 00:42:18.961]  Well, there's going to be massive earthquakes next month, we're all dead, run for the hills!
[00:42:19.402 --> 00:42:29.409]  I mean, that's entertaining to a certain level, and gets your mind off all the real crises that are happening, like genetically engineered foods that are deadly, what's in the water, what's in the food, what's in the air.
[00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.432]  Purposefully put there, I don't mean just all the toxic waste.
[00:42:35.374 --> 00:42:42.479]  But, uh, I think they are very capable of, uh, I don't know, I juggle between a
[00:42:45.442 --> 00:42:50.845]  Suitcase nukes, smallpox, or dirty bum.
[00:42:50.965 --> 00:42:53.286]  And I lean towards dirty bum.
[00:42:54.547 --> 00:43:00.410]  I don't think they really, at this time, want to blow up 20, 30 square blocks of a city and radiate a whole town.
[00:43:01.050 --> 00:43:13.577]  If they do that, it will be some medium-sized city of about 100,000 people, probably in the Midwest, that won't affect the rest of the country too much, but can have maximum effect.
[00:43:14.716 --> 00:43:18.098]  So if there is a suitcase nuke, I say Midwest, maybe even Texas.
[00:43:18.478 --> 00:43:19.679]  As far south as Texas.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.461]  So I should say from Texas to Illinois.
[00:43:23.781 --> 00:43:26.183]  Probably not in Illinois though, that would affect Chicago too much.
[00:43:26.763 --> 00:43:33.647]  But below Illinois down to South Texas.
[00:43:34.748 --> 00:43:37.069]  Prime suitcase nuke area.
[00:43:38.030 --> 00:43:41.772]  Now any area in the country is fair game for dirty bombs.
[00:43:43.652 --> 00:43:47.295]  Because a dirty bomb really doesn't... I mean, the globalists don't care about that.
[00:43:47.335 --> 00:44:01.827]  I mean, they've released hundreds of thousands of tons over the last 20, 30 years since they've been testing DU and using it all over the world, and it's the equivalent of thousands and thousands of, you know, atomic and nuclear tests.
[00:44:02.588 --> 00:44:04.590]  You know, just the stuff it's put into the atmosphere.
[00:44:06.039 --> 00:44:08.341]  And they admit that 11,000 people in the U.S.
[00:44:08.361 --> 00:44:11.983]  have died from nuclear tests and atomic tests alone.
[00:44:12.323 --> 00:44:16.285]  That's the new scientist with a major federal study that was released last Thursday.
[00:44:16.325 --> 00:44:17.186]  We covered that Friday.
[00:44:19.147 --> 00:44:22.589]  You know, I said I'd go to your calls, but see, this is pretty important, so let me just finish up and we'll go to them.
[00:44:24.711 --> 00:44:27.152]  So, Dirty Bomb, I think, is the number one thing.
[00:44:27.392 --> 00:44:29.153]  It's got all these scary connotations.
[00:44:29.233 --> 00:44:34.297]  It's got the word nuclear in it, radiological in it, but it...
[00:44:36.773 --> 00:44:39.054]  It isn't really that devastating.
[00:44:39.954 --> 00:44:42.194]  It'll make a bunch of people sick if it's really bad.
[00:44:42.474 --> 00:44:44.095]  It'll kill some people over time.
[00:44:44.955 --> 00:44:48.355]  It'll contaminate an area and people will have to go in with special gear and clean it up.
[00:44:48.936 --> 00:44:50.516]  It'll be a big grandstanding affair.
[00:44:54.057 --> 00:44:58.858]  I believe when they say it's biological, and they've been saying this for years, that it'll really be chemical.
[00:44:58.938 --> 00:45:05.119]  Something they can control and then just have one of their scientists declare it's biological and of course that'll be inoperative.
[00:45:06.536 --> 00:45:14.823]  But, you know, I think really in the next two years there's a very good chance one of these three scenarios is going to happen.
[00:45:16.445 --> 00:45:19.948]  And it could happen as early as next week, or it could happen in six months.
[00:45:20.028 --> 00:45:21.008]  It could happen in two years.
[00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:27.154]  But I really think that, I think we're going to see the dirty bomb.
[00:45:28.955 --> 00:45:32.298]  And, again, that's the most probable.
[00:45:32.458 --> 00:45:34.320]  Then, after that, atomic.
[00:45:35.529 --> 00:45:39.590]  And then after that, biological, it'll really be chemical.
[00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:41.570]  But they like hoaxes.
[00:45:41.630 --> 00:45:43.611]  They like hoaxes.
[00:45:43.651 --> 00:45:47.811]  They like to have the effect of you thinking it was ultramassive when it's not.
[00:45:48.872 --> 00:45:53.492]  So I tend to lean towards the chemical saying it's biological or the dirty bomb.
[00:45:54.393 --> 00:46:01.554]  And all this talk about the Russians gave Al-Qaeda suitcase nukes back in the early 90's and they're going to get us.
[00:46:03.393 --> 00:46:07.095]  I mean, Al-Qaeda was firmly on CIA payroll in the early nights.
[00:46:07.476 --> 00:46:11.498]  The Russians just don't hand these out like lollipops, you know, when you get a haircut.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.941]  Our government spent $20 billion buying these off of them.
[00:46:15.961 --> 00:46:17.782]  I mean, give me a break, folks.
[00:46:18.503 --> 00:46:21.185]  But they've been carefully planning that story forever.
[00:46:21.765 --> 00:46:26.428]  And if it does happen and they have the national draft... You see, people keep thinking we can't have a national draft.
[00:46:26.828 --> 00:46:29.530]  No, folks, it's after they stage an attack.
[00:46:29.890 --> 00:46:30.591]  Yes, they will.
[00:46:31.263 --> 00:46:32.724]  I've had members of Congress on.
[00:46:32.744 --> 00:46:34.584]  You know, Rangel said, oh yeah, there's an attack.
[00:46:34.865 --> 00:46:35.865]  Boom, the draft's done.
[00:46:35.885 --> 00:46:38.986]  That's why they got the draft board set up.
[00:46:39.026 --> 00:46:39.847]  They're all geared up.
[00:46:39.867 --> 00:46:42.548]  See, there's thousands of indicators here, okay?
[00:46:44.529 --> 00:46:46.389]  Just so much evidence for all of this.
[00:46:48.790 --> 00:46:52.532]  I mean, they tell you MS-13 Mexican gangs brought nukes across.
[00:46:52.592 --> 00:46:53.772]  The government's saying this.
[00:46:54.193 --> 00:46:55.173]  That is ridiculous.
[00:46:55.945 --> 00:47:06.611]  And I'm the first person to say, kick MS-13 out of here, kick Los Zetas out of here, but even if it's true that they brought it in, Los Zetas controls MS-13, it's well known, and who are they run by?
[00:47:06.651 --> 00:47:07.632]  The CIA!
[00:47:09.773 --> 00:47:10.253]  Oh yeah!
[00:47:10.694 --> 00:47:15.076]  It's mainstream news that these people killing cops and citizens all over the U.S.
[00:47:15.136 --> 00:47:15.877]  work for the U.S.
[00:47:15.937 --> 00:47:16.257]  government.
[00:47:16.517 --> 00:47:19.359]  They just claim they quit in the last year and have gone rogue.
[00:47:20.129 --> 00:47:22.550]  No, look at the cartels they're killing.
[00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:27.452]  It's all mid-level or small, you know, low-level drug dealers that aren't paying their cut.
[00:47:27.532 --> 00:47:28.313]  It's a drug war.
[00:47:29.093 --> 00:47:36.877]  Our government even has soldiers in America, foreign mercs, squads of hitmen, thousands of them, out ready to kill.
[00:47:37.577 --> 00:47:42.519]  Drug dealers, just like they're hiring Latin American former death squads to be in Iraq.
[00:47:42.559 --> 00:47:43.520]  That's mainstream news.
[00:47:44.204 --> 00:47:45.344]  These people don't change.
[00:47:45.565 --> 00:47:47.905]  Who do you think the new head of all intelligence is?
[00:47:48.445 --> 00:47:50.866]  Negroponte, the death squad leader.
[00:47:51.366 --> 00:47:52.947]  I mean, the supreme leader of them.
[00:47:54.287 --> 00:47:57.389]  They sent him over to Iraq a year ago, year and a half ago, with the death squads.
[00:47:57.729 --> 00:48:02.090]  He set death squads up publicly and came back here to be the head of domestic intelligence?
[00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:03.931]  The head of all intelligence.
[00:48:05.471 --> 00:48:07.132]  I'm not trying to scare you folks.
[00:48:07.212 --> 00:48:08.532]  I mean, this is not a joke.
[00:48:09.133 --> 00:48:10.993]  These people are unscrupulous criminals.
[00:48:11.533 --> 00:48:12.814]  They're hardcore murderers.
[00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:15.359]  They're not playing games!
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:19.543]  And they hide behind this mantle that they're conservatives.
[00:48:19.563 --> 00:48:20.103]  Give me a break.
[00:48:20.443 --> 00:48:21.825]  John in Florida, thanks for holding.
[00:48:21.865 --> 00:48:22.265]  Go ahead.
[00:48:22.886 --> 00:48:23.667]  Oh yes, Alex.
[00:48:23.727 --> 00:48:29.292]  I think your martial law video, I've made probably 70 copies of that on DVD, ROM.
[00:48:29.652 --> 00:48:30.253]  Good job!
[00:48:30.733 --> 00:48:35.318]  That would be something a lot of your listeners should really get and make copies of.
[00:48:35.982 --> 00:48:38.964]  Yeah, I started out to plug my videos ten minutes ago but never did.
[00:48:39.705 --> 00:48:42.867]  Another thing I think your listeners should get is potassium iodate.
[00:48:43.087 --> 00:48:45.168]  That would be something good to have.
[00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:48.331]  I bought some years ago, but that would be something good to have.
[00:48:48.371 --> 00:48:52.894]  Yeah, I bought about 15 bottles and gave most of them away, but I've got a few bottles around here for emergencies.
[00:48:52.914 --> 00:49:00.039]  For those that don't know, they've issued them to police, firemen, the folks at the post office.
[00:49:00.749 --> 00:49:21.902]  If there's a dirty bomb or any type of problem, you then take it and it fills the thyroid, that's the number one cause of death and radiation poisoning, is the thyroid absorbs the radioactive isotopes that are attached to the different chemicals that are in the body, the iodine, and that's what kills you.
[00:49:22.754 --> 00:49:31.798]  Yeah, your martial law, the part I liked was the interview with Buchanan, about all the whole Bush family, and that was really, really well done.
[00:49:32.538 --> 00:49:34.179]  Well, it's three videos in one.
[00:49:34.219 --> 00:49:35.440]  Do you think you got your money's worth?
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:36.260]  Oh, yeah.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.240]  Yeah, definitely.
[00:49:37.601 --> 00:49:38.001]  Definitely.
[00:49:38.341 --> 00:49:45.464]  Anyway, I'll hang up and... Oh, actually, I met Craig Roberts probably about eight or ten years ago and bought one of his books.
[00:49:46.404 --> 00:49:47.625]  Mike, you said he's coming on the air?
[00:49:48.225 --> 00:49:49.766]  Yeah, he is coming on in about ten minutes.
[00:49:51.092 --> 00:49:51.913]  Alright, thanks a lot Alex.
[00:49:52.193 --> 00:49:53.154]  Thank you for the call.
[00:49:54.075 --> 00:49:58.118]  Let's go ahead and go to the next caller and then we'll hold him over.
[00:49:58.199 --> 00:49:59.460]  Who's up next?
[00:50:03.012 --> 00:50:04.413]  Jeff and Mash, go ahead, sir.
[00:50:04.733 --> 00:50:05.174]  Yes, sir.
[00:50:05.594 --> 00:50:17.103]  As far as surveillance cameras is concerned, there's a movie out now called The Island, and the whole premise of the movie is these clones that are under constant surveillance 24 hours a day.
[00:50:17.643 --> 00:50:23.668]  If you ever see the movie, it'll blow your mind, and I believe that Hollywood is using movies to condition people for this.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:29.625]  Well, I mean, sir, already your cell phone can listen to you, tracks everywhere you go.
[00:50:30.526 --> 00:50:34.270]  Already the OnStar, these cracker chips they're trying to put in the vehicles everywhere.
[00:50:34.290 --> 00:50:37.854]  I mean, we're gonna be worse than 1984.
[00:50:37.934 --> 00:50:38.855]  London already is.
[00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:40.356]  You're right.
[00:50:41.497 --> 00:50:42.318]  You are absolutely right.
[00:50:42.398 --> 00:50:43.640]  I know, and this is freedom.
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.161]  No, this is not freedom.
[00:50:45.942 --> 00:50:46.683]  Tell you what, stay there.
[00:50:48.092 --> 00:50:56.524]  And by the way, they can never stop the terrorists with these cameras, but oh, they can catch you smacking your, uh, you know, ten-year-old in the hind end when they talk back.
[00:50:56.945 --> 00:50:58.147]  Oh, taking your kids!
[00:51:02.583 --> 00:51:05.444]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.704 --> 00:51:07.285]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.605 --> 00:51:12.308]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.628 --> 00:51:17.070]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.490 --> 00:51:21.652]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:21.892 --> 00:51:24.733]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.813 --> 00:51:29.475]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.675 --> 00:51:34.076]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.316 --> 00:51:41.518]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:52:01.716 --> 00:52:05.619]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.839 --> 00:52:11.284]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:11.564 --> 00:52:21.932]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:22.092 --> 00:52:26.436]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.616 --> 00:52:27.416]  We're good to go.
[00:52:41.601 --> 00:52:42.062]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.978 --> 00:53:05.421]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[00:53:05.661 --> 00:53:08.464]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:12.829]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:22.380]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, the small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:27.565]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[00:53:27.845 --> 00:53:31.809]  Loaded with xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found.
[00:53:31.929 --> 00:53:39.817]  Fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.
[00:53:40.037 --> 00:53:46.063]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the mangosteen with Zango, the original mangosteen functional health beverage.

[00:53:51.708 --> 00:53:52.308]  Call now 800-625-2890.
[00:54:13.107 --> 00:54:14.908]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:15.429 --> 00:54:17.850]  Jeff and Matt, finish up the points you were making, sir.
[00:54:18.311 --> 00:54:19.391]  Okay, very simple.
[00:54:20.532 --> 00:54:22.773]  What we should do is put cameras on the border.
[00:54:22.813 --> 00:54:25.335]  There is a severe logic deficit.
[00:54:26.196 --> 00:54:29.658]  They're putting all the surveillance in the inner cities, like my city of Chelsea.
[00:54:30.731 --> 00:54:49.545]  You know, they're developing cameras in Chelsea, and Boston has cameras... Sure, we've had microphones being put up every year in successive waves until the whole city has microphones everywhere just waiting, hooked into a FEMA paid for emergency management center, which is really the federalization center.
[00:54:51.146 --> 00:54:54.208]  It's in every major town or city openly.
[00:54:54.248 --> 00:54:58.492]  I mean, I'll never forget my dad about four years ago, it was even before 9-11,
[00:54:59.614 --> 00:55:00.614]  Called me at like 7 a.m.
[00:55:00.995 --> 00:55:04.056]  He goes, son, turn on the TV, C-SPAN, look!
[00:55:04.596 --> 00:55:26.105]  And they had the, you know, the federal chief on from the Department of Transportation and they were showing cameras all over the country on a screen and he was showing everybody and they even showed Austin and he admitted it has law enforcement uses so they put him in and say it's for traffic through grants
[00:55:27.372 --> 00:55:31.830]  For transportation, but then they go, oh, it has dual use law enforcement.
[00:55:33.456 --> 00:55:37.798]  And the tell-tale word is Gunshot Detectors.
[00:55:38.458 --> 00:55:39.879]  We've had them here for seven years.
[00:55:40.199 --> 00:55:42.620]  No one's ever caught with the Gunshot Detectors.
[00:55:42.921 --> 00:55:48.743]  But then you go to the website of the companies that sold the microphones, and it says, for surveillance, shotgun mics.
[00:55:49.023 --> 00:55:53.946]  Here's an example of two children playing in the street at 150 yards away.
[00:55:54.326 --> 00:55:55.627]  And you hear the kids talking.
[00:55:55.667 --> 00:55:57.548]  You click on and listen to the audio clip.
[00:55:57.868 --> 00:55:59.849]  This was in their demo back in 98.
[00:56:01.843 --> 00:56:03.684]  That is so sick.
[00:56:03.965 --> 00:56:06.006]  That's the end of our freedom of speech.
[00:56:06.347 --> 00:56:07.047]  What can I say?
[00:56:07.107 --> 00:56:08.448]  But then they're not even honest about it.
[00:56:08.508 --> 00:56:11.871]  See, they go, oh, it's the gunshot detectors.
[00:56:13.672 --> 00:56:14.293]  Oh, man.
[00:56:14.753 --> 00:56:19.977]  I mean, what if you're talking about what we're talking about in a park somewhere?
[00:56:20.678 --> 00:56:21.999]  Can these microphones pick that up?
[00:56:22.359 --> 00:56:23.040]  That's scary.
[00:56:23.100 --> 00:56:26.362]  That's the end of our First Amendment right there.
[00:56:26.462 --> 00:56:26.783]  It is.
[00:56:26.903 --> 00:56:28.264]  I appreciate your call.
[00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:48.086]  Look, in 1984 he gets a girlfriend and they have to drive, you know, on a train like 50 miles away, get in the woods, hike out in the middle of the woods of nowhere, and of course they find out later that shotgun microphones and cameras had picked everything up they did.
[00:56:49.427 --> 00:56:54.331]  Well, in the name of stopping trash dumping all over the country from Colorado to Austin, Texas,
[00:56:54.938 --> 00:57:03.262]  They've now put up in Austin, what was it last time I saw, like two years ago, it was like 300 cameras and microphones hidden in trees.
[00:57:04.122 --> 00:57:07.784]  And they're wireless and they transmit back to a central hub.
[00:57:08.144 --> 00:57:15.427]  And so all over the parks, all over even rural areas, greenbelts now have cameras up to stop dumping.
[00:57:16.047 --> 00:57:20.169]  And again, the average cops don't even have access to this, don't even know about this.
[00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:22.710]  It's all quietly been put in.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.601]  It's all quietly hooked into federal databases.
[00:57:27.161 --> 00:57:28.202]  Very quietly.
[00:57:28.262 --> 00:57:33.204]  And now that they're scaring us, they're going, hey, we need to use these for law enforcement now.
[00:57:33.584 --> 00:57:39.926]  Those gunshot detectors, they can double as microphones to keep you safe.
[00:57:40.767 --> 00:57:42.607]  I mean, it's so sick.
[00:57:42.687 --> 00:57:43.328]  But you're right.
[00:57:43.728 --> 00:57:46.629]  The border stays wide open.
[00:57:46.689 --> 00:57:48.990]  And they issue illegal aliens ID cards.
[00:57:50.951 --> 00:57:53.853]  So there you have it, total and complete fraud.
[00:57:54.193 --> 00:58:02.720]  But the scary thing is, what does the government have planned that is so scary and so bad that they know they're going to need this grid in everywhere?
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:10.085]  What is it they got planned that they know will resist so hard that they're going to have to come in with this draconian straitjacket?
[00:58:10.825 --> 00:58:12.567]  The last 30 seconds of this hour
[00:58:13.459 --> 00:58:17.461]  I want to encourage you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a 15 cent a day membership.

[00:58:57.558 --> 00:58:58.198]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.859 --> 00:58:59.920]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.641 --> 00:59:01.762]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.382 --> 00:59:03.243]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.964 --> 00:59:04.845]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.545 --> 00:59:09.309]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.729 --> 00:59:13.873]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.254 --> 00:59:20.820]  Well, the federal government has paid for millions of cameras
[00:59:21.659 --> 00:59:26.263]  and microphones in the last ten years around the United States to be put in.
[00:59:27.824 --> 00:59:30.927]  They put in the radio readers that read the tracker chips.
[00:59:31.007 --> 00:59:32.888]  They put those in five years ago in Texas.
[00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:35.730]  I saw them six years ago in California.
[00:59:36.891 --> 00:59:42.496]  They have put it all in and now they're going to announce another wave of putting them in.
[00:59:42.816 --> 00:59:50.082]  They're in neighborhoods, four-way stops literally in the middle of cornfields and cotton fields in Texas and everywhere else I've been.
[00:59:51.572 --> 00:59:52.713]  Now they're going, guess what?
[00:59:52.793 --> 00:59:54.454]  Those aren't just going to be used for traffic.
[00:59:54.534 --> 00:59:55.534]  They were never meant for that.
[00:59:55.595 --> 00:59:57.115]  That was one of the minor uses.
[00:59:57.636 --> 01:00:02.398]  It's going to be used for surveillance now!
[01:00:02.779 --> 01:00:05.020]  Because the terrorists attacked London.
[01:00:06.761 --> 01:00:07.661]  55 people died.
[01:00:07.681 --> 01:00:10.543]  56, I guess, if you count the guy they killed, the innocent person.
[01:00:11.463 --> 01:00:19.308]  And so because of that, we've got to give our children's liberties up and trust the government to have this total draconian system.
[01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:23.245]  That's really the big news right now is they're now being honest.
[01:00:23.926 --> 01:00:27.348]  London was honest 20 years ago when they started their camera program.
[01:00:27.388 --> 01:00:29.790]  Now 4.5 million in London alone.
[01:00:30.791 --> 01:00:32.653]  Every little small town bristling with cameras.
[01:00:32.873 --> 01:00:36.596]  Again, my dad was just in London and he said it was like porcupines.
[01:00:36.636 --> 01:00:37.737]  He said it was like a joke.
[01:00:37.837 --> 01:00:41.160]  You'd see a pole with like 80 cameras on it.
[01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.160]  He said he took pictures of it.
[01:00:42.180 --> 01:00:42.821]  I can't wait to see them.
[01:00:43.757 --> 01:00:45.398]  Been too busy to go over there and look at them.
[01:00:45.478 --> 01:00:51.321]  And he said it was just pictures of black helicopters saying you're being watched and all seeing eyes saying you're being watched.
[01:00:51.361 --> 01:00:56.163]  And we have some of those photos that we've gotten from other people up, but my dad saw them.
[01:00:57.163 --> 01:00:58.184]  He saw all this.
[01:00:58.284 --> 01:00:58.984]  My mother saw it.
[01:00:59.664 --> 01:01:02.686]  And she was too busy just looking at all the history.
[01:01:02.726 --> 01:01:03.946]  She's a big British history buff.
[01:01:04.447 --> 01:01:07.328]  She's been there many times, but she just drools over that stuff.
[01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:08.511]  Which I do, too.
[01:01:09.311 --> 01:01:09.932]  I love history.
[01:01:10.652 --> 01:01:11.893]  She knows a lot more than I do about it.
[01:01:11.913 --> 01:01:13.415]  She's got a couple of degrees in it.
[01:01:13.855 --> 01:01:16.797]  But my dad was freaked out.
[01:01:16.817 --> 01:01:20.580]  He said, Alex, just since we were there a long time ago, he said it was like a joke.
[01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:30.915]  He said you'd go in restaurants and there'd be like pods hanging down with like 20 watch eyes.
[01:01:31.255 --> 01:01:36.780]  He says now they've got pods everywhere with like little bitty cameras, you know, the size of the end of a ballpoint pen.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:43.446]  And they're just bristling everywhere, just spines of them, just light poles, wires, just
[01:01:44.477 --> 01:01:47.238]  And by the way, Austin has those watch eyes.
[01:01:47.258 --> 01:01:49.238]  They've got lots of these big huge ones you see.
[01:01:49.258 --> 01:02:04.361]  And I remember back in 98 when we were really doing a big investigation on all of this, in Austin we found out, I was talking to John Hurt of Texas Department of Transportation, our spokesman, and he was talking about all the cameras and the federal grants, and I said, so we have hundreds of cameras in Austin.
[01:02:04.401 --> 01:02:06.922]  He goes, no, no, thousands, well over 10,000.
[01:02:09.307 --> 01:02:13.630]  And then he proceeded to tell me, many of you have seen this on Austin Cable, or we've aired it.
[01:02:14.210 --> 01:02:18.873]  He proceeded to say, oh yeah, we get federal grants, they're little bitty wires, they're everywhere.
[01:02:21.234 --> 01:02:22.815]  And I said, but they're for law enforcement.
[01:02:22.855 --> 01:02:24.256]  He said, oh no, they're not for law enforcement.
[01:02:24.276 --> 01:02:28.739]  And I said, ah, Mr. Hurd, because you're a non-law enforcement body.
[01:02:30.416 --> 01:02:35.419]  But your sister organization, Texas Department of Public Safety, is using him for that.
[01:02:35.939 --> 01:02:37.300]  Alex, you ought to be a lawyer!
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:42.403]  Well no, I said, this is all on tape, I shouldn't be a lawyer, I'm just used to you guys' tricks.
[01:02:43.104 --> 01:02:44.424]  It's all semantics.
[01:02:44.885 --> 01:02:49.087]  In fact, a lot of times they tell the truth, but it's twisted.
[01:02:50.928 --> 01:02:55.531]  They revel in twisting it, and it makes me sick.
[01:02:56.605 --> 01:03:08.188]  So now, you think, you know, a billion plus dollars of cameras in New York, and, you know, almost that much in Boston for the RNC and DNC, and then, oh, we're going to keep them, we're going to keep the cameras in.
[01:03:09.889 --> 01:03:11.789]  We're going to keep the cameras in, sorry.
[01:03:14.090 --> 01:03:15.090]  You see how they do that?
[01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:16.991]  Over and over and over again?
[01:03:17.551 --> 01:03:21.552]  And oh, we put microphones up to look for gunshots, but guess what?
[01:03:21.572 --> 01:03:24.433]  They're wonderful long distance microphones to listen to you!
[01:03:26.039 --> 01:03:29.462]  Also, I've got reports they're putting up laser mics.
[01:03:29.622 --> 01:03:30.623]  Now, you're going to like these.
[01:03:31.684 --> 01:03:37.429]  These shoot a laser that's almost colorless so you don't see it on your window, like the red laser.
[01:03:38.050 --> 01:03:39.471]  And it listens to you.
[01:03:40.492 --> 01:03:44.456]  The membrane of the microphone is your glass window.
[01:03:45.457 --> 01:03:47.358]  These are being put up in your neighborhoods.
[01:03:47.418 --> 01:03:49.180]  I mean, it's freedom.
[01:03:53.132 --> 01:03:59.998]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.298 --> 01:04:01.680]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:01.860 --> 01:04:04.082]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.222 --> 01:04:06.304]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.584 --> 01:04:11.528]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:11.868 --> 01:04:15.892]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.132 --> 01:04:17.914]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:17.994 --> 01:04:28.626]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.806 --> 01:04:30.669]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.049 --> 01:04:34.712]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today and man the guns of the InfoWars.

[01:07:00.673 --> 01:07:01.774]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.434 --> 01:07:03.274]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.015 --> 01:07:04.955]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:04.975 --> 01:07:09.198]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.758 --> 01:07:13.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.221 --> 01:07:20.064]  Alright, there have supposedly been new developments concerning the Oklahoma City bombing.
[01:07:21.424 --> 01:07:24.106]  Federal documents being released for FOIA requests.
[01:07:25.009 --> 01:07:31.833]  Where the FBI is talking about, you know, a plan by Elohim City, white supremacist, to bomb OKC.
[01:07:32.414 --> 01:07:43.381]  And then another document got released where the Southern Poverty Law Center, this was a few months ago, supposedly, you know, knew a little bit about this, but instead said that it was, you know, the militia.
[01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:48.084]  So there's a lot of conflicting stuff out there, but we know what happened in Oklahoma City.
[01:07:48.604 --> 01:08:07.208]  And Colonel Craig Roberts, of course, best-selling author of One Shot, One Kill, Vietnam, Marine Corps Sniper, then in the Army, became a Colonel in the Army, worked in all different capacities from, you know, patrolman in the Tulsa Police Department up to helicopter pilot, SWAT team commander, you know, detective working Oklahoma City case.
[01:08:07.568 --> 01:08:09.789]  He worked some of the cases where they killed cops that
[01:08:10.373 --> 01:08:11.814]  Hi Alex, how are you?
[01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:43.613]  You talk a lot about the borders, and I just wanted to bring up this interesting story.
[01:08:43.673 --> 01:08:53.902]  I went, um, I lived near the Canadian border, and I was leaving, and, uh, I know the southern border is significantly different, but when we were leaving, the, uh, U.S.
[01:08:53.942 --> 01:08:57.986]  Border Patrol was talking to us and asked us a bunch of questions on our way out of the country.
[01:08:58.942 --> 01:09:00.043]  That's a little unnerving.
[01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:04.806]  Well, I've heard now, I mean, the last bit of the news, that you get more scrutiny leaving than coming in.
[01:09:05.126 --> 01:09:05.346]  Right.
[01:09:05.366 --> 01:09:09.749]  Well, because they don't want the slaves... It's about keeping the slaves in the Reich!
[01:09:10.190 --> 01:09:10.910]  Right, exactly.
[01:09:10.970 --> 01:09:21.397]  The third world populations that fly in unmolested into Toronto, a total open gateway to anybody that wants to go there, they've got to have a way to get into the U.S., so that's got to be open.
[01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:22.718]  But getting out, look,
[01:09:23.638 --> 01:09:31.323]  It came out in the Detroit Free Press, what, a few months ago, it's actually last year, time flies, that they x-ray you leaving, not coming in!
[01:09:31.343 --> 01:09:34.485]  No, I'm serious, they x-ray the cars.
[01:09:36.165 --> 01:09:42.269]  It's ridiculous, and it's just, I wonder, you know, you talk a lot about closing the borders, how do we do that and ensure that
[01:09:43.598 --> 01:09:45.879]  Our government has got unlimited funds.
[01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:46.959]  They just print more money.
[01:09:48.879 --> 01:09:55.421]  Very cheaply, for a few billion dollars more a year, they can hire thousands and thousands of border patrol.
[01:09:56.661 --> 01:10:00.022]  The states, it's wildly popular to control the borders.
[01:10:00.922 --> 01:10:08.224]  The state governors can call out and say we're doing a program to beef up civil defense
[01:10:09.056 --> 01:10:14.017]  And to beef up the State Guard, and we're going to start paying you, you know, more than a pittance.
[01:10:14.997 --> 01:10:22.419]  And so we're going to recruit for State Guard, a guarantee you won't be shipped out of the country, which they can't do anyways with State Guard, though they're trying.
[01:10:23.199 --> 01:10:35.522]  And we're going to have a six-month program to add, you know, in the northern states, maybe a thousand, two thousand State Guard on Texas and California, the big states that also have the big border problems.
[01:10:35.822 --> 01:10:37.883]  We're going to add ten thousand State Guard.
[01:10:38.779 --> 01:10:45.525]  And then we're going to pay these people full-time who want to go down or create some new state agency.
[01:10:45.845 --> 01:10:47.086]  Or have the state police do it.
[01:10:47.106 --> 01:10:49.849]  Have a giant hiring bonanza.
[01:10:49.869 --> 01:10:51.370]  The states can do this.
[01:10:51.610 --> 01:10:54.272]  The feds should be doing this, but they're not doing it.
[01:10:54.793 --> 01:10:58.236]  They've got troops on the border, but it's to look for drugs.
[01:10:58.296 --> 01:11:00.257]  It's not to look for illegal aliens.
[01:11:00.678 --> 01:11:03.240]  They could end that border problem in six months.
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:06.683]  There wouldn't be a jackrabbit making it across that border.
[01:11:07.617 --> 01:11:10.840]  How do you stop them from turning the guns in, if need be?
[01:11:12.081 --> 01:11:14.002]  From their perspective.
[01:11:14.022 --> 01:11:17.825]  That is a good point, but they've already done that.
[01:11:17.986 --> 01:11:18.666]  See, that's the point.
[01:11:19.186 --> 01:11:20.668]  It's hard for you to get out.
[01:11:21.188 --> 01:11:23.190]  It's not hard for other people to get in.
[01:11:23.210 --> 01:11:26.272]  Listen, anything else?
[01:11:26.532 --> 01:11:27.013]  No, that's it.
[01:11:27.053 --> 01:11:27.213]  Thanks.
[01:11:27.673 --> 01:11:28.574]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:28.974 --> 01:11:29.895]  Let's go to Craig Roberts.
[01:11:29.955 --> 01:11:34.259]  Craig, I wanted to talk about a few other news items before we got into Oklahoma City.
[01:11:35.129 --> 01:11:38.391]  What the caller just raved about controlling our borders.
[01:11:38.472 --> 01:11:43.255]  I mean, you've worked at all levels of, you know, on the ground, you know, peace officer.
[01:11:43.936 --> 01:11:45.076]  You've worked in the military.
[01:11:45.116 --> 01:11:47.558]  You've been in theater, you know, in Vietnam, in combat.
[01:11:47.978 --> 01:11:50.560]  I mean, am I incorrect in saying that we could secure the border?
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:53.503]  You do.
[01:11:53.523 --> 01:11:56.705]  I mean, we could secure the entire Ho Chi Minh Trail if we wanted to.
[01:11:56.725 --> 01:11:59.527]  Our southwest border
[01:12:00.339 --> 01:12:03.542]  Would be the easiest border to secure because it's desert.
[01:12:03.782 --> 01:12:05.343]  You know, there's no jungle to hide in.
[01:12:06.164 --> 01:12:10.307]  You know, with aircraft, you can control everything.
[01:12:10.387 --> 01:12:13.950]  With ground sensors, you can tell anytime anybody comes across.
[01:12:14.897 --> 01:12:22.322]  The issue is, you know, having enough people out there to deal with it so that the word gets back south of the border that if you cross, you will get caught.
[01:12:22.762 --> 01:12:26.905]  And you will be, you know, and here's the problem is, we just send them back and they just cross again.
[01:12:27.185 --> 01:12:32.508]  Well, we got 150,000 troops in Iraq, hundreds of thousands in Europe in support roles.
[01:12:32.888 --> 01:12:35.830]  I mean, 10,000 troops would end the problem pretty quick.
[01:12:36.110 --> 01:12:38.472]  Oh yeah, you know, I had a debate on that.
[01:12:39.139 --> 01:12:44.723]  On the internet once with a guy that was telling me that because of Posse Comitatus we can't use troops down there to enforce the law.
[01:12:44.923 --> 01:12:51.628]  Well, that's wrong because if you go to the Constitution itself, the primary job of the federal government is to defend the nation.
[01:12:51.868 --> 01:12:55.471]  Yeah, they're doing everything they're not supposed to and nothing they're supposed to.
[01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:55.811]  Right.
[01:12:55.891 --> 01:13:08.540]  You could put the entire United States Army on the southwest border from the Gulf of Mexico all the way to California and you'd be perfectly within the law because that is a border which is the federal government's responsibility.
[01:13:09.105 --> 01:13:13.427]  And what is incredible to me is they're doing absolutely nothing about it.
[01:13:13.487 --> 01:13:22.952]  I mean, they'll search an 80-year-old granny at the airport, but they won't stop, you know, 15 Islamic males coming across the border in New Mexico.
[01:13:23.032 --> 01:13:28.415]  Well, Craig, let me comment on that because I talked to one of the security screeners at the Austin airport
[01:13:29.182 --> 01:13:36.204]  I've watched it on the news, I've seen the AP photos, so it's not just the news is showing these images, this is what's really happening.
[01:13:36.684 --> 01:13:36.904]  Yeah.
[01:13:37.344 --> 01:13:56.409]  At the train stations, at the bus stations, at the parking lots at these places, now, they are literally, if it's a family of black people, a family of white folks, you know, with baseball caps on, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, ten-year-old, they're searching and pointing machine guns at them, and literally, people with turbans on their heads are walking right past.
[01:13:56.949 --> 01:13:57.149]  I mean,
[01:13:57.949 --> 01:14:09.458]  If the terror threat was really real from Islamist extremists, which I believe is manufactured, the evidence shows that, but even if it was real, how can they be training us that this is for the general public?
[01:14:09.938 --> 01:14:20.827]  Well, this whole terror thing is being promulgated to the point where it creates a Hegelian problem that they've got to solve by passing more laws that take more of our rights away.
[01:14:20.847 --> 01:14:21.447]  It's as simple as that.
[01:14:21.487 --> 01:14:25.130]  It's moving us into a police state by utilizing a manufactured problem
[01:14:25.775 --> 01:14:26.316]  I think?
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:42.282]  You know, it's hard to keep the cattle in the barn if the door's left open.
[01:14:42.562 --> 01:14:43.222]  Well, exactly.
[01:14:43.242 --> 01:14:44.763]  That's a better analogy.
[01:14:44.803 --> 01:14:47.864]  My complex one is, you've got a castle.
[01:14:48.085 --> 01:14:51.726]  They leave the drawbridge down, welcome in the enemy barbarian hordes.
[01:14:52.106 --> 01:14:58.870]  Meanwhile, the castle guard are busy guarding five-year-old children because they might be barbarian hordes.
[01:14:59.050 --> 01:15:00.510]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:15:02.251 --> 01:15:04.192]  I went to my congressman, and I sat down with
[01:15:05.006 --> 01:15:08.709]  And I said, what is the White House saying about the border problem?
[01:15:09.189 --> 01:15:10.851]  You know, what is Bush's plan?
[01:15:10.911 --> 01:15:11.792]  What's he going to do?
[01:15:11.852 --> 01:15:13.593]  What's he even mentioned to you?
[01:15:13.613 --> 01:15:14.814]  He says, absolutely nothing.
[01:15:14.854 --> 01:15:18.317]  I can't get any information out of him at all that he's even concerned with it.
[01:15:18.657 --> 01:15:19.738]  Well, now that tells you right there.
[01:15:20.218 --> 01:15:30.727]  If he's going to be concerned about teaching SWAT teams in Baghdad, and concerned about, you know, searching Pearl Harbor veterans in Honolulu, trying to get on an airplane to get home from reunion,
[01:15:31.207 --> 01:15:34.890]  Then why isn't he concerned about our entire Southwest border?
[01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:37.952]  And let me tell you, I just... I gotta stop you again.
[01:15:38.012 --> 01:15:47.177]  Tell that story about you're over at the base in Hawaii doing some military stuff, and this is like a year ago, and I saw this in Chicago.
[01:15:47.257 --> 01:15:55.683]  People on oxygen, you know, with their little military hats on from World War II, with some mean foreigner rudely jabbing at them.
[01:15:55.723 --> 01:15:57.884]  I mean, tell that story.
[01:15:58.064 --> 01:16:00.286]  Well, actually I was on my way to Hawaii,
[01:16:01.325 --> 01:16:10.947]  And it was right after 9-11 and it was in October of that year and I changed planes at LAX to get on Hawaiian Airlines and we were at the gate
[01:16:12.004 --> 01:16:17.847]  And this is when they had the odd screener at the gate that would get you as you're trying to get on the airplane and pull you out of line.
[01:16:19.307 --> 01:16:21.709]  I notice they're not doing that right now, but then they were.
[01:16:21.749 --> 01:16:25.490]  And this is after we'd already gone through magnetic gates, we'd walked past National Guard guys.
[01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:28.692]  I saw them search a guy who looked like he was about to die.
[01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:29.552]  Yeah.
[01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:38.036]  We get up there and they're having a Pearl Harbor Survivors Reunion and they've got all these old guys with their ball caps on and their medals on the ball cap.
[01:16:38.576 --> 01:16:40.697]  I saw the exact thing, but it was only one guy with his wife.
[01:17:00.817 --> 01:17:02.298]  And she looked like she was probably about 78.
[01:17:02.539 --> 01:17:03.039]  He had to be like 89.
[01:17:03.159 --> 01:17:06.041]  And he had a walker.
[01:17:06.782 --> 01:17:08.443]  They were rolling an oxygen tank.
[01:17:08.824 --> 01:17:11.406]  And he had the little military hat with all the medals on it.
[01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:20.273]  And literally, I almost said something because this scumbag was being rude to him because he was obviously deaf.
[01:17:21.534 --> 01:17:24.476]  She was like yelling at this old man.
[01:17:24.496 --> 01:17:25.377]  I mean, this is sick.
[01:17:25.497 --> 01:17:27.579]  Well, I went up to the screener and I said, what are you doing?
[01:17:28.365 --> 01:17:29.467]  He said, well, it's none of your business.
[01:17:29.507 --> 01:17:31.069]  I said, well, I can make it my business.
[01:17:31.669 --> 01:17:32.751]  I said, what are you doing?
[01:17:33.332 --> 01:17:34.533]  He says, well, I'm searching this guy.
[01:17:34.553 --> 01:17:42.684]  I said, you just let a whole bunch of people get on that, you know, are obviously of Middle Eastern descent without a second look and you're pulling out an American hero, a war veteran,
[01:17:43.143 --> 01:17:46.344]  Who's obviously, you know, here on Legitimate Business to search.
[01:17:46.504 --> 01:17:48.185]  He says, well, we're not allowed to profile.
[01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:52.266]  I says, well, you better find, you better figure out a way to profile, son, because you know what?
[01:17:52.606 --> 01:17:56.787]  And I threw my badge on him and I said, I've been a police officer for 27 years and I'm going to tell you something right now.
[01:17:57.147 --> 01:18:08.191]  When they put out an APB for a, you know, a white male in his 20's that just robbed a convenience store, we don't stop little old ladies in their 80's.
[01:18:08.231 --> 01:18:10.051]  We don't stop black guys in their 40's.
[01:18:10.111 --> 01:18:12.072]  We look for the right kind of person.
[01:18:12.552 --> 01:18:14.233]  And if you, you know, you need to start thinking about it.
[01:18:14.253 --> 01:18:21.035]  I know, it's not, and by this whole profiling argument that the media gave all this attention, it was designed to make us all suspects.
[01:18:21.275 --> 01:18:31.939]  If a red van with a Mexican male, 35 years old, with an anchor tattoo on his left forearm, just killed somebody, you don't go pull over 45-year-old black women.
[01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.360]  Precisely.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:39.482]  And every police department in the world profiles, but TSA doesn't?
[01:18:39.722 --> 01:18:40.722]  Now what's wrong with this picture?
[01:18:42.288 --> 01:18:42.949]  It's insane.
[01:18:43.769 --> 01:18:45.751]  Well, it's about training us all to be slaves, isn't it?
[01:18:47.272 --> 01:18:48.153]  I mean, it boils down to that.
[01:18:48.173 --> 01:18:49.734]  We're going to come back and talk about the London bombing?
[01:18:50.735 --> 01:18:52.076]  Get Colonel Roberts' take on that.
[01:18:53.917 --> 01:19:00.282]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:05.426]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency technology.
[01:19:05.806 --> 01:19:13.712]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:19:13.872 --> 01:19:20.937]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:19:21.158 --> 01:19:22.358]  There are no side effects.
[01:19:22.519 --> 01:19:25.921]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:27.062]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:19:27.342 --> 01:19:28.622]  Eliminate the cause!
[01:19:28.822 --> 01:19:35.664]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:19:35.784 --> 01:19:38.285]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:19:38.405 --> 01:19:42.366]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625
[01:19:53.226 --> 01:19:56.508]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:56.568 --> 01:20:00.771]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:00.991 --> 01:20:03.773]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:03.973 --> 01:20:06.375]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:06.555 --> 01:20:15.200]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.400 --> 01:20:16.761]  The Brookie light is different.
[01:20:16.941 --> 01:20:21.084]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.424 --> 01:20:21.744]  I think so.
[01:20:51.846 --> 01:20:55.035]  Hi, folks.
[01:20:55.095 --> 01:20:56.840]  Jack Browner here from Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.163]  The real money folks.
[01:21:01.454 --> 01:21:03.375]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:21:03.855 --> 01:21:04.735]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:21:04.775 --> 01:21:05.395]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:21:05.476 --> 01:21:05.816]  A 5% increase.
[01:21:05.836 --> 01:21:08.277]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:21:08.297 --> 01:21:10.157]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:21:10.177 --> 01:21:11.638]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[01:21:11.658 --> 01:21:13.138]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:21:28.934 --> 01:21:31.976]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:21:32.516 --> 01:21:37.679]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:42.902]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[01:21:43.583 --> 01:21:46.524]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[01:21:46.965 --> 01:21:48.385]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.363 --> 01:21:56.404]  Gano CafÃ© is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[01:21:56.645 --> 01:21:58.425]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[01:21:58.646 --> 01:22:02.287]  Gano CafÃ© is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[01:22:02.587 --> 01:22:08.370]  What makes Gano CafÃ© special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[01:22:08.570 --> 01:22:14.552]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[01:22:14.852 --> 01:22:18.553]  One packet of Gano CafÃ© is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[01:22:18.714 --> 01:22:23.535]  All-natural Gano CafÃ© tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[01:22:23.675 --> 01:22:28.717]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.
[01:22:28.877 --> 01:22:31.238]  You can experience Gano CafÃ© for yourself.
[01:22:31.478 --> 01:22:34.379]  Find out what people around the world are drinking for energy.
[01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:37.861]  And to meet the demands of a busy day, the natural and healthy way.
[01:22:38.041 --> 01:22:39.482]  Try Gano Cafe today.

[01:22:48.967 --> 01:22:57.231]  Alright, your calls are coming up later in the shower.
[01:22:59.221 --> 01:23:06.870]  We're going to finish up with the TSA, then get into the London situation and the latest developments concerning Oklahoma City and other inside jobs.
[01:23:10.206 --> 01:23:36.973]  Clearly now they're saying, we're not just going to have TSA in the, and this was so predictable, in fact, you predicted on the show, I remember so did I, it's not hard to do, that then there'll be bombings on buses, doesn't even have to be here, it can be over there, now we gotta have checkpoints at buses, now we gotta, last year they said, we need to put checkpoints in malls, random searches, checkpoints, metal detectors to get in, but meanwhile the castle gates are open, the barn door is open,
[01:23:38.374 --> 01:23:39.014]  It's a joke!
[01:23:39.075 --> 01:23:43.717]  I mean, it's a total fraud, and they know that this isn't going to stop terror.
[01:23:44.018 --> 01:23:48.781]  Then, Colonel Roberts, being in the military, being a law enforcement, what is this really about?
[01:23:49.041 --> 01:23:53.143]  Well, I think that there's three or four agendas that happen at the same time.
[01:23:53.183 --> 01:24:00.508]  You know, these people behind a lot of this use their time to accomplish as much as possible, and there's always several layers on the onion.
[01:24:01.324 --> 01:24:04.665]  The first layer of the onion is what we see on TV and what they want us to think.
[01:24:04.705 --> 01:24:07.046]  The second layer is what they're really doing behind the scenes.
[01:24:07.066 --> 01:24:12.227]  And the third layer is something they're planning to happen on down the road that we're not supposed to know about, and so on.
[01:24:12.467 --> 01:24:13.007]  Exactly!
[01:24:13.107 --> 01:24:14.788]  Why are they putting this control grid in?
[01:24:14.808 --> 01:24:16.408]  That's exactly what I said last hour.
[01:24:16.768 --> 01:24:22.470]  You've got to think about what they claim, the fraud they're pushing, and then what they're really doing, and then why are they doing it.
[01:24:22.550 --> 01:24:25.571]  And what are they planning next week, next month, next year?
[01:24:26.431 --> 01:24:30.112]  And what we've got here, I just had to fly up to
[01:24:31.112 --> 01:24:31.894]  I don't know.
[01:24:42.356 --> 01:24:51.000]  And I noticed that everybody was just lining up meekly in their nice little lines and producing all this identification and no one saying anything because they don't want to miss their flight.
[01:24:51.020 --> 01:24:52.221]  They don't want to get detained and so on.
[01:24:52.241 --> 01:24:57.423]  So basically what we've had on the TSA deal at the airports is an exercise in mind control.
[01:24:57.784 --> 01:24:59.525]  We're being lined up like sheep.
[01:25:00.105 --> 01:25:00.685]  Be quiet.
[01:25:00.865 --> 01:25:01.766]  Don't say anything.
[01:25:01.826 --> 01:25:03.787]  You can't even carry nail clippers with you.
[01:25:04.387 --> 01:25:06.008]  And it gets very intimidating.
[01:25:06.028 --> 01:25:08.449]  In fact, when I went through the gate in Tulsa,
[01:25:09.391 --> 01:25:14.013]  There was nail clippers in my shaving kit bag.
[01:25:14.153 --> 01:25:15.073]  I didn't even think they were in there.
[01:25:15.093 --> 01:25:16.353]  I didn't even think about it.
[01:25:16.753 --> 01:25:18.534]  I've done that every time I fly.
[01:25:19.054 --> 01:25:21.295]  And they have to call a supervisor over.
[01:25:21.715 --> 01:25:24.476]  They show it to you and say, do you know this is a prohibited item?
[01:25:24.516 --> 01:25:25.516]  And they wave it in your face.
[01:25:26.152 --> 01:25:28.493]  I looked at it and I said, well, if you say so.
[01:25:29.633 --> 01:25:39.636]  They're treating you like garbage and you're supposed to sit there and take it and say, oh, meekly, yes, ma'am, no, sir, you know, I'm so sorry, and yada, yada, yada.
[01:25:40.216 --> 01:25:42.277]  I looked at him and I said, well, you can have it if you want it.
[01:25:42.997 --> 01:25:44.918]  And they said, well, did you know it's a privileged item?
[01:25:45.198 --> 01:25:46.218]  I said, no, I didn't.
[01:25:46.338 --> 01:25:48.119]  I didn't think you could hurt anybody with nail clippers.
[01:25:48.749 --> 01:25:50.851]  I said, when there's all kinds of other weapons on the airplane.
[01:25:51.171 --> 01:25:51.912]  Shoelaces!
[01:25:51.972 --> 01:25:52.312]  Yeah!
[01:25:52.572 --> 01:25:53.713]  I mean, there's so much on there.
[01:25:53.793 --> 01:25:55.855]  Shoelaces are a garage!
[01:25:55.875 --> 01:25:56.395]  Seatbelts!
[01:25:56.655 --> 01:25:58.797]  Yeah, I mean, the oxygen masks.
[01:25:58.917 --> 01:26:01.379]  I mean, there's so many things on an airplane that you could use.
[01:26:01.479 --> 01:26:02.720]  A rolled up magazine.
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.322]  They give you the magazines on every chair.
[01:26:04.342 --> 01:26:06.804]  You can roll one up and use it as a weapon.
[01:26:08.244 --> 01:26:12.566]  There's so many ridiculous things, but the bottom line is that that doesn't have anything to do with it.
[01:26:12.706 --> 01:26:23.229]  What it is all based around is us being good little citizens, lining up, doing as we're told... No, I mean it's just like in the old German war movie where, line up, papers please!
[01:26:23.289 --> 01:26:24.129]  Right, exactly.
[01:26:24.789 --> 01:26:25.229]  Exactly.
[01:26:25.269 --> 01:26:31.091]  In fact, if you go to my website at riflewarrior.com, scroll down, look at the article that says you have papers.
[01:26:31.935 --> 01:26:33.657]  And it goes into the whole TSA thing.
[01:26:33.877 --> 01:26:38.081]  By the way now, they've had TSA before they, quote, disbanded it and changed the name last month.
[01:26:38.622 --> 01:26:45.288]  It has trained police departments all over the country and other security services to teach you how to do this.
[01:26:45.328 --> 01:26:46.649]  And the whole country!
[01:26:46.670 --> 01:26:48.251]  This was announced last year.
[01:26:48.611 --> 01:26:50.513]  Shopping malls, checkpoints.
[01:26:50.994 --> 01:26:52.715]  I mean, this is going to be hell on earth, Craig.
[01:26:52.876 --> 01:26:55.258]  Well, you know, you and I both have predicted
[01:26:56.236 --> 01:26:59.279]  Uh, dozens of things that would happen and they've all happened.
[01:26:59.580 --> 01:27:00.681]  So I'm going to predict another one.
[01:27:01.001 --> 01:27:04.485]  We're going to end up with border control checkpoints at the states.
[01:27:04.665 --> 01:27:10.631]  We're going to end up with city control checkpoints near the city limits before you can even get in or out of town.
[01:27:10.711 --> 01:27:13.353]  They'll have different types of security lockdowns on cities.
[01:27:14.254 --> 01:27:17.818]  Uh, they're going to set up a, of course, the national citizen ID thing.
[01:27:18.591 --> 01:27:25.417]  Uh, where you can go through, it'll be a card reader, uh, they're going to do the smart chip deal, and it's just going to keep going all the way down to everybody.
[01:27:25.437 --> 01:27:26.538]  Did you know they introduced that?
[01:27:26.578 --> 01:27:28.479]  That's in the Texas legislature right now?
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.502]  The legislature of several states.
[01:27:31.762 --> 01:27:35.625]  Yeah, uh, actually yeah, 24 states right now are trying to pass chips.
[01:27:35.785 --> 01:27:38.147]  In the inspection sticker that tracks you.
[01:27:38.726 --> 01:27:49.590]  Yeah, and you know, you get these pipe passes that you have in your car, everybody's going to have a citizen ID pass on their car that every time you go under one of these camera lights, it's going to tell them where your car was.
[01:27:51.611 --> 01:27:56.253]  You know, I'm looking for them to have smart technology in the steering wheel that only a certain person can drive the car.
[01:27:56.832 --> 01:27:59.433]  Well, Toyota just came out with that.
[01:27:59.453 --> 01:28:03.014]  Here we go, I can't even predict and it's already happened now.
[01:28:03.414 --> 01:28:06.575]  But these things are happening and it all has to do with controlling the population.
[01:28:06.595 --> 01:28:13.816]  But the border's going to be wide open and we're going to give more tuition to illegals, give them credit, just basically they're felons but they're legal.
[01:28:14.237 --> 01:28:18.058]  Oh yeah, and you've got Aslan Brigade wants to take over California and Arizona.
[01:28:18.778 --> 01:28:19.518]  And they're letting them do it.
[01:28:21.061 --> 01:28:29.122]  They're doing nothing against these guys who are professed terrorists, who say, we will kill you white people, we will do this, we will do that, we're going to take this place back as if we ever had it.
[01:28:30.463 --> 01:28:38.604]  Well, let's get into the London bombing briefly and then into all of the real threats, the nuclear threat, the suitcase nuke threat, and there's new Oklahoma City information.
[01:28:39.464 --> 01:28:41.624]  Stay with us and get ready!
[01:28:43.745 --> 01:28:46.745]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:50.326]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.658 --> 01:28:55.258]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:28:55.398 --> 01:28:59.499]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:28:59.639 --> 01:29:02.540]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:09.321]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:29:09.501 --> 01:29:12.502]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:29:12.702 --> 01:29:15.122]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:29:15.222 --> 01:29:23.124]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:29:23.424 --> 01:29:34.713]  Mercosine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[01:29:34.873 --> 01:29:42.039]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:29:42.059 --> 01:29:42.520]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:29:53.334 --> 01:29:56.915]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:29:57.175 --> 01:29:58.036]  Look no further!

[01:30:27.581 --> 01:30:27.881]  I'm good.
[01:30:53.832 --> 01:30:57.594]  For a while now, you've been hearing about energized water and what it can do for your health.
[01:30:57.834 --> 01:31:01.296]  But have you taken the next step and actually experienced energized water?
[01:31:01.576 --> 01:31:06.398]  It's absolutely incredible what you'll experience while using the energized products from Aqua Northwest.
[01:31:06.698 --> 01:31:11.001]  You've seen the banner on GCNlive.com, but have you experienced the power of the pyramid?

[01:31:56.068 --> 01:32:02.111]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:32:02.711 --> 01:32:05.653]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:08.834 --> 01:32:10.695]  By the way, you're hearing it here first.
[01:32:11.195 --> 01:32:12.356]  I've been really, really busy.
[01:32:13.917 --> 01:32:16.618]  But in the next three or four months,
[01:32:17.276 --> 01:32:20.637]  I'm going to rent a big hall that holds a couple thousand people.
[01:32:21.677 --> 01:32:27.178]  And I'm going to have a weekend event where we have five or six top speakers in.
[01:32:27.218 --> 01:32:34.639]  One of them will be Colonel Roberts to do a half a day, four or five hour presentations.
[01:32:35.859 --> 01:32:40.060]  And it's going to be unlike some of the other meetings I've had around the country that are OK.
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:40.900]  This one's going to be great.
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:45.941]  We're not going to have any kooks in attendance on the speakers list.
[01:32:46.581 --> 01:32:52.085]  It's going to be all real information exposing the New World Order on a whole bunch of different facets.
[01:32:52.886 --> 01:32:56.208]  So, again, I've got that in the hopper.
[01:32:56.889 --> 01:32:57.890]  I'm thinking about it.
[01:32:57.930 --> 01:32:59.691]  I'm just literally so busy it's insane.
[01:32:59.711 --> 01:33:02.153]  I am going to be going to London very, very soon.
[01:33:02.193 --> 01:33:07.937]  I'm not going to tell you when, but sooner rather than later to go over there and work on some big stories.
[01:33:08.618 --> 01:33:14.162]  And then coming up on August 3rd, I'm going to be on Coast to Coast AM for three hours
[01:33:15.071 --> 01:33:16.913]  Talking about basically just everything.
[01:33:17.233 --> 01:33:22.278]  The whole New World Order, why people believe in the New World Order, why people are waking up so fast.
[01:33:23.058 --> 01:33:25.701]  That's really the basis of the discussion with George Norrie.
[01:33:26.181 --> 01:33:28.543]  So that's coming up next Wednesday.
[01:33:29.944 --> 01:33:31.526]  And before we go back to Colonel Roberts...
[01:33:32.992 --> 01:33:34.273]  You really should visit his website.
[01:33:34.313 --> 01:33:34.854]  It's excellent.
[01:33:34.914 --> 01:33:36.215]  RifleWarrior.com.
[01:33:36.515 --> 01:33:38.437]  A lot of great news articles and commentary.
[01:33:38.457 --> 01:33:50.387]  And of course, you can see a list of the amazing books, bestsellers, and others that I think are even better than some of his bestsellers, but they're anti-New World Order, so you never hear about them, that are there at RifleWarrior.com.
[01:33:50.948 --> 01:33:58.034]  And then also, folks, I've made 12 films, and these videos will not be seen if you don't get them.
[01:33:58.693 --> 01:34:04.537]  And make copies of them and air them on AXS TV and give them to friends and family and give them to opinion makers in your area.
[01:34:05.458 --> 01:34:17.406]  The power of the citizenry taking action with these videos and making the copies and passing them out and telling others to make copies is exponential.
[01:34:17.607 --> 01:34:18.247]  Geometric.
[01:34:18.307 --> 01:34:21.529]  I mean, one tape can turn into tens of thousands.
[01:34:22.250 --> 01:34:24.451]  And thousands of tapes can turn into tens of millions.
[01:34:24.471 --> 01:34:25.712]  I mean, I've done the math before.
[01:34:26.553 --> 01:34:28.074]  And that is what's happened.
[01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:40.616]  I mean, literally, the amount of videos I sell is not that large, but it's like a mustard seed growing into this huge tree because of you planting those seeds.
[01:34:41.256 --> 01:34:42.297]  So please help us.
[01:34:42.357 --> 01:34:51.903]  Get Martial Law that covers the police state, the 9-11 developments, and Who the Globalist Are, the Bush-Nazi connection, the connection to the occult, how both parties are controlled.
[01:34:52.163 --> 01:34:53.704]  It's a three-hour mini-series.
[01:34:55.065 --> 01:34:57.206]  Get my classic 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny.
[01:34:58.024 --> 01:35:05.147]  That covers Oklahoma City, the first World Trade Center, the second World Trade Center attacks, and the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:35:05.568 --> 01:35:06.828]  It's almost three hours long.
[01:35:07.288 --> 01:35:10.830]  So you get your money's worth with these videos as well, and you support us.
[01:35:11.651 --> 01:35:12.651]  Get Matrix of Evil.
[01:35:12.711 --> 01:35:13.812]  It's a good video that I made.
[01:35:13.852 --> 01:35:14.972]  Get American Dictators.
[01:35:15.032 --> 01:35:15.552]  It's excellent.
[01:35:16.153 --> 01:35:20.955]  Go to infowars.com to order via the SafeSecure shopping cart.
[01:35:22.197 --> 01:35:23.358]  Infowars.com.
[01:35:23.378 --> 01:35:25.959]  You can watch video clips of the films, look at all the different specials.
[01:35:26.339 --> 01:35:31.041]  We've got specials running where some videos are 75% off.
[01:35:31.621 --> 01:35:34.462]  And we carry a lot of other great books and videos by other researchers.
[01:35:34.622 --> 01:35:37.843]  So there's a bookstore on Infowars.com.
[01:35:38.443 --> 01:35:42.285]  You can order right there via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:48.743 --> 01:35:49.724]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:35:50.184 --> 01:35:53.527]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:35:54.128 --> 01:35:55.869]  Get the videos.
[01:35:56.290 --> 01:35:58.371]  And people always complain that I don't give the address out.
[01:35:58.972 --> 01:36:06.438]  Yes, it's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:36:07.279 --> 01:36:09.421]  Alright, Craig, we've got loaded phones.
[01:36:09.441 --> 01:36:11.082]  We haven't even gotten into Oklahoma City yet.
[01:36:11.102 --> 01:36:13.444]  You're going to be with us about 30 minutes to the next hour.
[01:36:13.484 --> 01:36:16.307]  I know you're busy with some fencing you've got to put up to keep your animals in.
[01:36:17.272 --> 01:36:20.634]  They're on your Hacienda in Oklahoma.
[01:36:21.234 --> 01:36:28.418]  But getting into the London bombings, for those that just joined us, let me just throw this out.
[01:36:29.399 --> 01:36:35.482]  We know that they were running drills at the exact same time, exact same places, two and a half weeks ago on 7-7.
[01:36:36.023 --> 01:36:36.683]  That's impossible.
[01:36:37.310 --> 01:36:40.232]  The classic cover story, just like 9-11, they're running drills.
[01:36:40.592 --> 01:36:46.895]  Or Putin's people get caught planting bombs in Moscow in 1999 by Moscow police, they catch them, oh, we're running a drill.
[01:36:47.415 --> 01:36:48.976]  So you've got that operational cover.
[01:36:49.156 --> 01:36:51.877]  Always the tell-tale sign, a simultaneous drill.
[01:36:52.838 --> 01:37:04.504]  Okay, then we've got eyewitnesses on buses and trains saying bombs blew up into the structure, not, you know, with packages on board the buses.
[01:37:05.111 --> 01:37:07.433]  We have this guy running onto a train.
[01:37:08.333 --> 01:37:09.775]  They come and sit on him.
[01:37:10.315 --> 01:37:11.236]  He's not resisting.
[01:37:11.256 --> 01:37:16.800]  They pump five rounds into him, and now they're saying it's someone with the army dressed up like police doing this.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:19.021]  Obviously, folks, some of their special forces.
[01:37:19.622 --> 01:37:20.482]  SAS or whoever.
[01:37:20.522 --> 01:37:21.003]  We don't know.
[01:37:21.343 --> 01:37:23.084]  The police say, hey, that's just the way it is.
[01:37:23.465 --> 01:37:25.006]  We may have to start killing people.
[01:37:25.826 --> 01:37:28.008]  Even if they're innocent, it's better safe than sorry.
[01:37:29.498 --> 01:37:33.500]  007.
[01:37:29.759 --> 01:37:33.500]  Two weeks ago they issued license to kill powers to the General Police.
[01:37:34.120 --> 01:37:35.081]  So we have that going on.
[01:37:35.101 --> 01:37:45.245]  By the way, the reason they killed him, he looked scared, he was jogging, and he was wearing a raincoat, a sports jacket, a windbreaker.
[01:37:45.866 --> 01:37:49.087]  And for those that don't know, the day he died it was 62 degrees in London.
[01:37:50.428 --> 01:37:53.629]  So, I mean, I wear a windbreaker a lot of times when it's that chilly.
[01:37:54.209 --> 01:37:56.290]  Especially if I'm not going to be out doing something strenuous.
[01:37:56.671 --> 01:37:57.451]  So they killed him.
[01:37:58.515 --> 01:38:02.056]  There's a hundred other points, evidence, they doctored surveillance camera videos.
[01:38:02.536 --> 01:38:05.757]  Look at how they had emergency powers about to pass right when it happened.
[01:38:06.097 --> 01:38:07.637]  The Patriot Act helped pass here.
[01:38:07.958 --> 01:38:09.278]  Blair's in deep political trouble.
[01:38:09.338 --> 01:38:10.898]  His national ID card's in trouble.
[01:38:11.438 --> 01:38:14.539]  All this is going on and then magically this happens.
[01:38:14.579 --> 01:38:17.560]  Now were they decoys as part of another government drill?
[01:38:18.120 --> 01:38:23.741]  Or were these guys that ran up and supposedly threw satchels on buses and then none of them explode?
[01:38:24.122 --> 01:38:25.482]  You know, four times out of four.
[01:38:26.661 --> 01:38:32.404]  All of this is very, very suspicious and points towards an element in the government doing this.
[01:38:32.724 --> 01:38:34.685]  Colonel Roberts, your comments on that?
[01:38:34.925 --> 01:38:38.847]  Well, you know, if we did a laundry list of all the times
[01:38:39.757 --> 01:38:50.722]  Where we found other explosives had gone off and was not the official version of the story, such as Oklahoma City, we know that there was plastic explosives on the columns inside the building.
[01:38:50.762 --> 01:38:52.263]  Jane Graham witnessed them putting it up.
[01:38:52.783 --> 01:39:03.768]  We know that probably Strassmayer was involved because she saw him and picked his picture out and said, that's one of the three guys I saw putting his stuff on the columns when I came to work that day in the Murrah Building.
[01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:13.178]  We know that there's firefighters who talked about explosions that went off below them after they were in the World Trade Center buildings.
[01:39:14.159 --> 01:39:15.921]  People on the street said they heard rumbling.
[01:39:16.643 --> 01:39:17.003]  I don't
[01:39:37.356 --> 01:39:40.059]  Doesn't meet what the eyewitnesses saw.
[01:39:40.940 --> 01:39:43.883]  TW800, you know, 200-something people saw one or two missiles.
[01:39:44.143 --> 01:39:48.107]  The government says the airplane just decided to blow up that night, end of story.
[01:39:48.848 --> 01:40:00.039]  You know, it's just to the point to where anytime somebody gets on a podium, on television, after an event, and starts to make a statement, you can just about be guaranteed he's lying.
[01:40:00.898 --> 01:40:03.821]  Uh, and if he's not lying on day one, he will be by day two when they spin it.
[01:40:03.941 --> 01:40:18.692]  And, you know, we've talked about this before, where the most important time to watch the news is the first 15 minutes to hour after the event happens, because you're going to have spontaneous things going on with everybody trying to, you know, push cameras around and get statements and see what's going on.
[01:40:19.212 --> 01:40:21.614]  By the next day, half the stuff you saw has disappeared.
[01:40:21.995 --> 01:40:23.696]  You'll not see it again, because they washed it.
[01:40:24.381 --> 01:40:28.723]  And when that happens, you know that this operation wasn't just some bad guys.
[01:40:28.944 --> 01:40:33.166]  There's somebody else behind the operation, and they're using these guys as scapegoats.
[01:40:33.366 --> 01:40:34.547]  They're the Lee Harvey Oswalds.
[01:40:35.707 --> 01:40:37.108]  You know, that's the first layer of the onion.
[01:40:37.708 --> 01:40:39.009]  This is what we want you to believe.
[01:40:39.069 --> 01:40:39.989]  This is what we want you to see.
[01:40:40.009 --> 01:40:40.970]  Well, it's like in Dallas.
[01:40:41.010 --> 01:40:46.253]  They have the Army doing drills, you know, in the skies above.
[01:40:47.792 --> 01:40:54.276]  The day that Reagan was shot, this is admitted, they were doing a presidential succession drill where he gets shot.
[01:40:54.776 --> 01:40:58.578]  I mean, explain to people why they love to use drills as the cover.
[01:40:59.258 --> 01:41:09.624]  Well, I think, you know, you get enough things going on, enough events going on, you lessen the possibility of very many eyewitnesses.
[01:41:11.929 --> 01:41:19.174]  I want to watch a parade over here, so why should I pay any attention to a dog barking in the backyard, even though that's a burglar breaking in the house?
[01:41:19.274 --> 01:41:21.355]  I'm watching the parade with a marching band.
[01:41:21.395 --> 01:41:27.039]  The more pizazz stuff that they can throw out there, the more attention it's going to get, and it's a diversion.
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.542]  So, a lot of this stuff is a diversion.
[01:41:29.582 --> 01:41:33.905]  A lot of it, I think, there's some coincidence in some of it, but not all of it.
[01:41:34.405 --> 01:41:41.131]  And when we see these things, we're seeing a lot of things going on around us and most people can't process it all.
[01:41:41.664 --> 01:41:42.765]  They don't look behind the door.
[01:41:42.785 --> 01:41:53.272]  Yeah, basically it's a cover, it's a distraction, and then if people within the compartmentalized government agencies who are good notice part of this operation, they just go, hey, that's need to know.
[01:41:53.852 --> 01:42:00.476]  Or if one of their operatives gets caught involved in the terror attack or the operation, oh no, he was just part of the drill.
[01:42:01.097 --> 01:42:10.483]  Well, imagine, you know, the big ship during World War II, a Japanese freighter, steams into Tokyo Bay.
[01:42:11.403 --> 01:42:14.065]  Well, everybody's looking at the big ship steaming into Tokyo Bay.
[01:42:14.085 --> 01:42:19.929]  What they don't understand is there's an American fleet boat submarine underneath it that's following it in through the nets.
[01:42:20.749 --> 01:42:21.830]  The diversion's the big ship.
[01:42:22.851 --> 01:42:31.917]  So that's what you're seeing is a lot of this stuff, you're going to see this dog and pony show when in actual fact you need to be looking other places at the same time to find out what else is going on.
[01:42:33.058 --> 01:42:37.741]  Anything that's not usual in your neighborhood, check it out and see what's going on behind the scenes.
[01:42:38.906 --> 01:42:40.927]  You know, it's just the old police rule of thumb.
[01:42:41.367 --> 01:42:42.948]  And we don't do that.
[01:42:42.968 --> 01:42:48.410]  A lot of times what Americans do, they close the blinds, they close the windows, they close the doors, they put their head in the sand.
[01:42:48.470 --> 01:42:49.391]  They don't want to know anything.
[01:42:49.431 --> 01:42:50.371]  They don't want to get involved.
[01:42:50.411 --> 01:42:58.935]  I can't tell you how many times I've been on calls where somebody's been shot, somebody's been killed, somebody's been beaten up, and I couldn't find any witnesses, even though I know 20 people saw it.
[01:42:59.655 --> 01:43:00.755]  They don't want to get involved.
[01:43:00.835 --> 01:43:04.957]  You know, that's incredible that I've seen car wrecks.
[01:43:05.197 --> 01:43:07.078]  And I know by law, plus I do it anyway,
[01:43:07.779 --> 01:43:08.760]  I pull over to help.
[01:43:09.581 --> 01:43:14.987]  And all these people that were even in front of me are witnesses standing, you know, pumping gas at a gas station 20 yards away.
[01:43:15.468 --> 01:43:23.156]  I see them, you know, witness it, and they get in their cars and get out of there, and then I wait, and I'm like the only person when the cops show up.
[01:43:23.897 --> 01:43:25.579]  And Americans didn't used to be like that.
[01:43:25.599 --> 01:43:27.641]  I mean, we see these stories every week or two where
[01:43:28.544 --> 01:43:33.147]  A woman's beaten up and raped and beaten in the head with a lead pipe in a street and lays there for an hour.
[01:43:33.428 --> 01:43:35.269]  People walk by her naked, bleeding body.
[01:43:35.709 --> 01:43:40.993]  Or we had a few years ago, a cop got hit in the street and he got knocked off the side of the road right by a big gas station.
[01:43:41.253 --> 01:43:44.696]  He lay there for 45 minutes before cops came by and helped him.
[01:43:45.016 --> 01:43:45.256]  Yeah.
[01:43:45.336 --> 01:43:46.837]  I mean, oh, I don't want to get involved.
[01:43:47.097 --> 01:43:48.058]  I don't want to get involved.
[01:43:48.178 --> 01:43:49.119]  I don't want to get involved.
[01:43:49.579 --> 01:43:52.281]  Well, there's a case, I can't remember the gal's name, Mary something.
[01:43:52.748 --> 01:43:57.449]  That they use as an example in police academies that actually happened back in the early 60s.
[01:43:57.469 --> 01:44:09.973]  This gal was walking down the street and a guy walked up to her with a knife and there were people in all the buildings around looking out the window and he began stabbing her in this alcove of this building and there was, you know, 30-40 people sitting there watching.
[01:44:10.193 --> 01:44:11.354]  No one called the police.
[01:44:11.434 --> 01:44:12.534]  No one tried to interfere.
[01:44:12.614 --> 01:44:14.575]  No one yelled out the window, hey what are you doing?
[01:44:14.955 --> 01:44:16.995]  No one came to the woman's aid and this guy walked off.
[01:44:18.136 --> 01:44:19.096]  And that was in the 60s.
[01:44:20.129 --> 01:44:28.862]  So, you know, I don't know exactly when this stuff started happening, but a lot of it has to do with people not wanting to get involved because they don't want to go to court, they don't want to miss work, they don't want to testify.
[01:44:29.483 --> 01:44:33.549]  Don't they know, though, that that creates an atmosphere where all of us are in more danger?
[01:44:34.255 --> 01:44:35.636]  When nobody cares about each other?
[01:44:36.056 --> 01:44:38.216]  They're always waiting for the other guy to deal with it.
[01:44:38.457 --> 01:44:39.717]  You know, let the police deal with it.
[01:44:39.777 --> 01:44:44.219]  Let somebody else deal with it that knows more about it than I do, or bigger than I am, or whatever.
[01:44:45.119 --> 01:44:47.280]  But instead they'll tattle on things that don't matter.
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:49.120]  Ooh, I heard my neighbors arguing.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.561]  I better call the police.
[01:44:50.961 --> 01:44:54.262]  But then they see somebody climbing over the fence, they don't call the police.
[01:44:54.662 --> 01:44:56.103]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[01:44:57.003 --> 01:44:58.564]  Back to the bombings before I forget about it.
[01:44:58.704 --> 01:44:59.064]  In London,
[01:45:00.311 --> 01:45:07.216]  If you have an explosive, and I've been all over the Metro underground in London, the Tube, they call it.
[01:45:07.236 --> 01:45:08.738]  You even trained with them, didn't you?
[01:45:08.798 --> 01:45:18.545]  Oh yeah, I worked with the London PD for five weeks, the London Metropolitan Police, the Met they call it over there, the Bobbies, walked beach with them and the whole bit, and good bunch of guys, and they try real hard.
[01:45:18.605 --> 01:45:22.568]  Of course they're unarmed, and I felt naked walking around in a postal police uniform and no gun belt.
[01:45:23.126 --> 01:45:27.447]  But they're arming them now.
[01:45:27.707 --> 01:45:31.868]  Well, what they rely on there is they rely on their whistles and their radios.
[01:45:32.568 --> 01:45:38.889]  Because there's so many police in London that you can't go anyplace without one standing on a corner someplace.
[01:45:38.909 --> 01:45:41.430]  If you get somebody running from you, you blow your whistle and start chasing them.
[01:45:41.450 --> 01:45:44.450]  You keep blowing your whistle and by the time you get to the end of the block, you've got five cops there.
[01:45:45.451 --> 01:45:49.231]  It's incredible how fast they can react.
[01:45:49.291 --> 01:45:51.272]  Well, when you get into the London Underground, the Tube,
[01:45:54.018 --> 01:46:05.965]  The only way that you can have explosives going on under the cars in a tube station is have something on the tracks that's disguised where no one realizes it because everybody over there is conscious of packages.
[01:46:06.366 --> 01:46:06.886]  Everybody.
[01:46:06.926 --> 01:46:09.548]  Because the IRA stuff that happened, you know, several years ago.
[01:46:10.108 --> 01:46:19.714]  So everybody reports suspicious packages and at every stop there's usually a Metro Police guy there that, you know, he's watching everything and he's definitely watching for packages.
[01:46:20.568 --> 01:46:21.688]  Because of the IRA bombings.
[01:46:21.908 --> 01:46:23.789]  Plus you've got bristling cameras.
[01:46:24.129 --> 01:46:25.729]  Right, you've got cameras everywhere over there now.
[01:46:26.029 --> 01:46:26.770]  More than when I was there.
[01:46:27.250 --> 01:46:38.252]  And so the only way you could have something, it had to have been placed there at some time where it was either buried in the gravel or it was in something that didn't look out of the ordinary.
[01:46:38.733 --> 01:46:41.153]  Or it was thrown under the train just before it drove up.
[01:46:41.993 --> 01:46:44.094]  In any case, it had to be detonated somehow.
[01:46:44.234 --> 01:46:48.515]  Well, what they're doing to detonate these things now is they're putting cell phones on them.
[01:46:48.894 --> 01:46:52.261]  And they're just calling that number and when the cell phone rings it sets off the blasting cap.
[01:46:53.704 --> 01:46:58.606]  That's what the Arabs are doing, or the terrorists are doing in Baghdad.
[01:46:59.106 --> 01:47:03.247]  A lot of these car bombs are all set off remote control now by cell phones.
[01:47:03.347 --> 01:47:04.347]  It's extremely simple.
[01:47:04.927 --> 01:47:07.608]  And that could have been very easily done.
[01:47:08.228 --> 01:47:14.250]  And you call one cell phone number after another on your little list right there, just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[01:47:14.370 --> 01:47:19.231]  Also, within 45 seconds these bombs go off, and then now even Scotland Yard,
[01:47:20.211 --> 01:47:24.592]  Another tactic they've come up with now is they recruit you and say, you're going to do this.
[01:47:24.612 --> 01:47:26.632]  You're going to be a suicide bomber.
[01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:33.854]  Or you're going to take this package and all you're going to do is just leave it there and let us know when it's there.
[01:47:47.273 --> 01:47:48.273]  You know, and then you can leave.
[01:47:48.873 --> 01:47:51.734]  But what's going to happen if you don't do it is we're going to kill your whole family.
[01:47:52.414 --> 01:47:53.174]  We know where they live.
[01:47:53.214 --> 01:47:54.054]  We know who they all are.
[01:47:54.114 --> 01:47:58.675]  And so one of the deals in Baghdad, a guy drove up and the bomb didn't go off.
[01:47:59.316 --> 01:48:02.396]  And he was handcuffed to the steering wheel of the car at the checkpoint.
[01:48:02.476 --> 01:48:04.937]  And they got him out of the car to interrogate him.
[01:48:05.397 --> 01:48:09.938]  And when they saw the handcuff on him, he said, I didn't want to be here, but I had no choice.
[01:48:10.478 --> 01:48:12.118]  They've got my family in their hands.
[01:48:12.718 --> 01:48:14.699]  So a lot of this isn't as
[01:48:16.234 --> 01:48:18.695]  So many people want to die for allies are being forced to.
[01:48:20.236 --> 01:48:28.680]  Back to the London deal, you know, it's very easy to have some guy just carry a package someplace and lay it down and walk off to a pay phone and call you and say, OK, it's there.
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:30.821]  Then you call it on a cell phone and bang, there it goes.
[01:48:31.562 --> 01:48:32.902]  It is so simple to do this stuff.
[01:48:32.922 --> 01:48:35.804]  But what's going to happen now is the lockdowns.
[01:48:37.044 --> 01:48:40.326]  You know, the thing about the London bombings, the first ones that went off,
[01:48:40.962 --> 01:48:44.424]  What was going on in this country that very same day?
[01:48:44.864 --> 01:48:48.986]  They were going to extend or make permanent the Patriot Act.
[01:48:49.926 --> 01:48:55.348]  And Bush said, oh look, we've had more of these smaller bombings last week.
[01:48:55.408 --> 01:48:57.789]  That very same day, we better pass this.
[01:48:57.889 --> 01:48:58.170]  Yeah.
[01:48:58.950 --> 01:49:01.031]  And then when that happened, everybody just stood up and said, OK.
[01:49:02.171 --> 01:49:07.254]  So basically, there goes more of our rights, there goes more of our privacy, and so on.
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:34.533]  believe that al-qaeda is such a gigantic organization and they could do all of these things uh... so successfully it just it the p l o has been able to do it islamic jihad has been able to do it hamas has not been able to do it these guys have been around for for decades with billions of dollars of funding unlimited funding but now magically al-qaeda
[01:49:35.273 --> 01:49:39.019]  And they admit Al-Qaeda is only a file name in the CIA, by the way.
[01:49:39.359 --> 01:49:40.922]  Yeah, that's just a name for the group.
[01:49:41.322 --> 01:49:44.227]  Yeah, funny that they would take the name that the CIA gave them.
[01:49:45.288 --> 01:49:46.089]  It's a total fraud.
[01:49:46.110 --> 01:49:49.074]  We're going to come back and talk about OKC and then start going to your calls.
[01:49:49.094 --> 01:49:49.535]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.306 --> 01:49:57.167]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.427 --> 01:49:59.007]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.348 --> 01:50:04.029]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.369 --> 01:50:08.770]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:09.210 --> 01:50:13.412]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.612 --> 01:50:14.252]  The Constitution
[01:50:14.292 --> 01:50:16.453]  ...has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.533 --> 01:50:21.214]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.414 --> 01:50:25.795]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.055 --> 01:50:33.277]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.537 --> 01:50:35.957]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.118 --> 01:50:37.838]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:53.490 --> 01:50:58.712]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.872 --> 01:51:06.955]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.215 --> 01:51:14.257]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.457 --> 01:51:15.738]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.798 --> 01:51:21.700]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:26.983]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.083 --> 01:51:35.966]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.227 --> 01:51:40.829]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[01:52:50.305 --> 01:52:51.787]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:04.562 --> 01:53:05.742]  William and many others.
[01:53:05.782 --> 01:53:10.344]  We'll go straight to your calls here in about six and a half minutes when we start the third hour.
[01:53:10.364 --> 01:53:12.685]  Bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[01:53:13.045 --> 01:53:14.506]  We'll get Craig Roberts' take on it.
[01:53:14.606 --> 01:53:16.246]  Always great to have Colonel Roberts on with us.
[01:53:16.746 --> 01:53:18.267]  RifleWarrior.com is the website.
[01:53:18.287 --> 01:53:19.007]  Check it out today.
[01:53:23.303 --> 01:53:28.849]  Craig, I have this article here from a week and a half ago, KTOK TV.
[01:53:29.429 --> 01:53:33.633]  Newspaper claims former DOJ officials confirm bombing cover-up.
[01:53:34.094 --> 01:53:44.945]  The FBI releases, through a FOIA request, a document saying, oh yeah, we basically knew there was going to be a bombing orchestrated by Elohim City and the white supremacists.
[01:53:45.886 --> 01:53:59.214]  Years ago, Craig, we knew the government and Morris Dees and others wanted to blame white supremacists, then try to connect that in to the right wing in America and have this big purge.
[01:53:59.575 --> 01:54:01.696]  So we predicted all this would be said and done.
[01:54:02.096 --> 01:54:06.679]  The problem is, if the feds have these surveillance camera tapes, just show us the tapes.
[01:54:06.739 --> 01:54:14.524]  We've talked to the FBI agents and others that have seen these tapes and police that witnessed, not the tapes, but what actually happened, was Middle Easterners
[01:54:15.430 --> 01:54:17.973]  One getting out of the truck, three waiting down the street.
[01:54:18.514 --> 01:54:20.536]  These Iraqis, we even know their names.
[01:54:20.937 --> 01:54:22.279]  We know they work for the U.S.
[01:54:22.319 --> 01:54:22.659]  government.
[01:54:22.699 --> 01:54:23.720]  We know they were protected.
[01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:28.506]  So, just like a classic intelligence operation, you've got white supremacists swirling around it.
[01:54:28.847 --> 01:54:30.308]  You've got Arabs swirling around it.
[01:54:30.829 --> 01:54:33.673]  You've got all this happening, but again, who has the motive?
[01:54:34.253 --> 01:54:36.215]  And then we have the government protecting the people.
[01:54:36.255 --> 01:54:43.281]  Then we have Andre Strassmeyer, witnesses said, Jane Graham and others, as a workman, one of the heads of Elohim City, later turns out as U.S.
[01:54:43.321 --> 01:54:47.144]  intelligence, tied him with the German intelligence, tied him with the U.S.
[01:54:47.684 --> 01:54:49.346]  He's protected, allowed to leave the country.
[01:54:49.686 --> 01:54:51.627]  He's supposedly seen in the bottom of the building.
[01:54:52.428 --> 01:54:58.373]  So, Craig, everything we've been talking about over these years, now we're being sent down the rabbit trail that it's Elohim City.
[01:54:58.413 --> 01:54:59.013]  Tell us about it.
[01:54:59.394 --> 01:55:01.495]  Well, when you've got
[01:55:02.356 --> 01:55:08.459]  You know, like Cash writing articles trying to reinforce stuff he was saying a long time ago, and still doing it.
[01:55:08.479 --> 01:55:11.340]  I find that's a little bit on the on the odorous side.
[01:55:12.241 --> 01:55:15.783]  We know for a fact that we investigated Ellawine City inside and out.
[01:55:15.823 --> 01:55:19.104]  We can tell you the names of Millar's grandchildren.
[01:55:19.184 --> 01:55:21.685]  I mean, we know which house everybody lives in.
[01:55:23.351 --> 01:55:30.136]  The whole thing, yeah, there was some talk of blowing up buildings there, but it was done by people who came in from the outside.
[01:55:30.176 --> 01:55:35.999]  You had Dennis Mahon down there, you had Andrea Strassmeier come in, and just agent provocateur type stuff.
[01:55:36.220 --> 01:55:45.085]  Because these people down there weren't interested in any of this other than the fact that they did have some ties back to the old Covenant Sword and Arm of the Lord.
[01:55:45.185 --> 01:55:49.368]  But then Strassmeier is ID'd there at OKC.
[01:55:49.408 --> 01:55:52.010]  He's ID'd in the building when they're putting explosives on the columns.
[01:55:52.549 --> 01:55:58.998]  And then we get the FBI, Trinidad gets the FBI memos that show and answer the question for me of what...
[01:55:59.752 --> 01:56:03.215]  Interested Morris Dees and the Southern Poverty Law Center having this to begin with?
[01:56:03.295 --> 01:56:10.320]  And why did they and the ADL do everything they could to derail the investigation and point us off on skinheads and neo-Nazis and L.O.M.
[01:56:10.340 --> 01:56:10.620]  City?
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:17.005]  It shows that one of the major people they're fingering, or the group they're fingering, is actually one of their minions.
[01:56:17.846 --> 01:56:18.346]  Absolutely.
[01:56:18.586 --> 01:56:21.108]  And then you've got... So here's the problem... I've got to stop you.
[01:56:21.869 --> 01:56:23.690]  Repeat that for people that might have missed it.
[01:56:24.391 --> 01:56:24.791]  Which part?
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:28.741]  Understand, we've got the Morris Dees Memo, and tell people what that says.
[01:56:28.941 --> 01:56:39.165]  Well, okay, the Morris Dees Memo is an FBI memo that says that Andrew Strassmayer was reporting, basically, to paraphrase, to the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[01:56:39.906 --> 01:56:43.247]  And that which means, since he was there prior to the bombing,
[01:56:43.638 --> 01:56:51.061]  That the Southern Poverty Law Center had to know if there was anything going on there, and if there was any bombing plans going on, then they would have had to have information on that.
[01:56:51.241 --> 01:56:53.262]  And then you've got Strausmeier in the building.
[01:56:53.943 --> 01:56:55.643]  And then, but let's take it a step further.
[01:56:55.683 --> 01:57:03.227]  When Strausmeier goes to leave the country, if he's an asset of Morris Dease, why is he picked up by Kirk Lyons, who's just the opposite of Morris Dease?
[01:57:03.287 --> 01:57:08.849]  Kirk Lyons is the guy, he's a lawyer who defended the Waco survivors and got them all 40 years apiece.
[01:57:08.909 --> 01:57:09.990]  Great defense lawyer.
[01:57:10.498 --> 01:57:13.700]  He's the guy that defended the KKK against Morris Deas.
[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:18.223]  He's the guy that defended all these neo-Nazi bunches, skinheads and so on.
[01:57:18.303 --> 01:57:23.527]  And then he gets Strassmeier, who's supposedly over here for the German government, to infiltrate the neo-Nazi bunch.
[01:57:23.587 --> 01:57:25.989]  And he's using the lawyer that defends the neo-Nazis.
[01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:29.251]  I mean, this egg just gets more colors every time we dip it in the pot.
[01:57:29.631 --> 01:57:31.052]  It's pretty clear what's going on.
[01:57:31.072 --> 01:57:31.973]  We'll tell you when we get back.

[01:57:38.249 --> 01:57:38.589]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.837 --> 01:57:51.898]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.599 --> 01:57:53.700]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.361 --> 01:57:55.201]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.942 --> 01:57:56.843]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.863 --> 01:58:01.287]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.688 --> 01:58:05.832]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.273 --> 01:58:11.177]  Alright, William, Reggie, Jeff, Jason, ready to get your calls?
[01:58:12.276 --> 01:58:12.716]  We've got Col.
[01:58:12.756 --> 01:58:17.700]  Roberts with us for another 30 minutes and then we're going to get into a bunch of other news I haven't even covered yet.
[01:58:18.100 --> 01:58:19.121]  There's so much of it!
[01:58:19.661 --> 01:58:25.385]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and the InfoWars.net of course.
[01:58:26.026 --> 01:58:27.266]  All have separate webmasters.
[01:58:27.286 --> 01:58:27.967]  A lot of different news.
[01:58:27.987 --> 01:58:28.847]  Be sure and check them out.
[01:58:29.768 --> 01:58:31.049]  And don't forget Col.
[01:58:31.149 --> 01:58:33.290]  Roberts' website, RifleWarrior.com.
[01:58:33.711 --> 01:58:37.193]  Craig, I want to go ahead and get to William in this segment, but just a brief question.
[01:58:38.754 --> 01:58:39.755]  And it starts with a statement.
[01:58:40.706 --> 01:58:45.889]  People listen to this show and at first they get confused because reality isn't simple.
[01:58:46.830 --> 01:58:51.993]  You know, you've got white supremacist leaders who admittedly work for the German government to infiltrate neo-Nazi groups.
[01:58:52.954 --> 01:58:57.117]  You've got this individual scene planting explosives in the building.
[01:58:57.137 --> 01:59:07.704]  You've got the Feds saying it's McVeigh alone, but the local police and the surveillance cameras grab international security, show these Middle Eastern Arabs who we know work for the Pentagon
[01:59:09.565 --> 01:59:12.126]  This is how an intelligence operation works.
[01:59:12.266 --> 01:59:13.126]  Multi-layered.
[01:59:13.546 --> 01:59:14.727]  A lot of confusion.
[01:59:16.047 --> 01:59:19.489]  The truth must be guarded by a bodyguard of lies, as Churchill said.
[01:59:19.789 --> 01:59:21.449]  Can you speak to that, Colonel?
[01:59:24.481 --> 01:59:34.524]  It's just one thing after another along that line where they get so many false rabbit trails going in so many different directions and they did that to us on the investigation up front.
[01:59:34.564 --> 01:59:45.147]  We kept getting, well we need to check this and we need to check that and it ended up being like the Kennedy assassination where you had 200 agents out in the field interviewing Aunt Matilda and Aunt Matilda's mule had nothing to do with the investigation but it created paperwork.
[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:48.005]  And here, you know, what a great investigation we did.
[01:59:48.065 --> 01:59:50.289]  Here's 16 feet of paperwork we did.
[01:59:50.770 --> 01:59:52.052]  But none of it has any substance.
[01:59:52.072 --> 01:59:57.303]  You've got to go through all of it to find one 302 report that means anything, and then you find out it's been altered.
[01:59:58.051 --> 01:59:59.852]  And that's not what the person said after all.
[01:59:59.872 --> 02:00:05.695]  I mean, we see this all the time, and that is a typical government cover-up type operation, and that's what we ran into here.
[02:00:05.875 --> 02:00:14.719]  But it's pretty clear, I mean, they want to ban free speech, take our guns, total police state gulag, Morris D. Southern Sleaze Center, Southern Primary Law Center.
[02:00:15.040 --> 02:00:17.521]  They're caught in their own memos.
[02:00:18.061 --> 02:00:26.730]  This is now admitted with Strassmeier reporting to them and he's the guy in there reportedly by eyewitnesses that fit the description planting the bomb.
[02:00:27.151 --> 02:00:31.115]  He's running all over the country trying to create a link with militias and other people.
[02:00:31.455 --> 02:00:32.877]  Same thing McVeigh is doing.
[02:00:33.297 --> 02:00:34.478]  It gets pretty clear, Colonel.
[02:00:34.779 --> 02:00:35.319]  Oh, yeah.
[02:00:35.499 --> 02:00:39.344]  You know, when Strassmeier came in, one of the first things he did is appointed himself Chief of Security at L.M.
[02:00:39.364 --> 02:00:39.604]  City.
[02:00:39.984 --> 02:00:41.945]  She's an informant, goes public, and then they try to go after her.
[02:01:01.016 --> 02:01:01.577]  It's incredible.
[02:01:01.918 --> 02:01:06.325]  Because again, they were gonna, they were, look, I go back to the Bum, Scare Award, and 98.
[02:01:06.586 --> 02:01:09.952]  Texas Monthly gives these to like 20 idiots every year.
[02:01:10.372 --> 02:01:11.234]  It's a big deal.
[02:01:12.395 --> 02:01:13.496]  Guess who won first place?
[02:01:13.516 --> 02:01:23.483]  The FBI for creating a Klan group that didn't even exist before of literally low-grade morons, some of them were retarded, that's always the M.O.
[02:01:24.004 --> 02:01:34.752]  literal retarded people trying to get them to carry out bombings and when they couldn't finally do that they went ahead and arrested them and Klan they ended a great plan to bomb a chemical plant.
[02:01:35.353 --> 02:01:37.074]  Well, Craig, it's the same story.
[02:01:37.114 --> 02:01:38.815]  Well, Waco was the same thing for the ATF.
[02:01:38.855 --> 02:01:40.016]  They were going to lose their funding.
[02:01:40.056 --> 02:01:41.497]  They were talking about disbanding them.
[02:01:41.517 --> 02:01:44.278]  They were talking about rolling them over into the FBI.
[02:01:44.298 --> 02:01:48.000]  And so the ATF, in a drastic move, goes to Waco and does a big photo op.
[02:01:48.501 --> 02:01:51.362]  And it turns out not worked so good because they get shot back at.
[02:01:52.163 --> 02:01:53.444]  And that's what that whole thing was.
[02:01:53.464 --> 02:01:54.384]  They were going to go in there.
[02:01:54.844 --> 02:01:57.226]  That's why they had the media with cameras rolling on a raid.
[02:01:58.230 --> 02:02:04.255]  It was to bolster their image and say, gee, look at all these people we caught with automatic weapons and this, that, and the other.
[02:02:04.275 --> 02:02:07.478]  We even got the memo where they said this was going to be a great funding mechanism.
[02:02:07.518 --> 02:02:08.379]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:08.839 --> 02:02:10.701]  And they ended up killing 51 people.
[02:02:11.662 --> 02:02:16.406]  On my website right now, by the way, I've posted the defense motion filed by Nichols Lawyers.
[02:02:16.986 --> 02:02:21.310]  So go to RifleWarrior.com, scroll down to the Oklahoma City Bombing Report, and right below that,
[02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:24.592]  Read that Nichols Lawyer's Defense Motion.
[02:02:24.653 --> 02:02:26.695]  It goes into all of the other stuff we're talking about.
[02:02:26.795 --> 02:02:29.298]  Alright, we're going to come back to Dr. William, Reggie, Jeff, and Jason.
[02:02:29.539 --> 02:02:30.980]  Then we'll get into that new motion.
[02:02:31.641 --> 02:02:32.422]  And a lot more.
[02:02:32.722 --> 02:02:34.404]  We've got 55 minutes left.
[02:02:34.465 --> 02:02:35.486]  I hope you'll stay with us.
[02:02:35.566 --> 02:02:37.648]  It's going to be jam-packed with the truth.
[02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:40.372]  Not propaganda.
[02:02:46.098 --> 02:02:49.022]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:49.703 --> 02:02:50.985]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.185 --> 02:02:56.934]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.214 --> 02:03:02.422]  In 2 hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:02.742 --> 02:03:06.925]  Brace yourselves, as the New World Order program for world domination has blown wide open.
[02:03:07.065 --> 02:03:10.847]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:11.107 --> 02:03:15.750]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:15.830 --> 02:03:18.592]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[02:03:18.892 --> 02:03:22.094]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:03:22.134 --> 02:03:23.975]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:03:42.186 --> 02:03:44.268]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:45.922 --> 02:03:54.986]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.246 --> 02:04:06.471]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.811 --> 02:04:12.514]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:12.754 --> 02:04:19.420]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:19.641 --> 02:04:26.467]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:26.727 --> 02:04:28.489]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:04:28.749 --> 02:04:30.811]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.

[02:04:37.297 --> 02:04:47.825]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[02:04:47.905 --> 02:04:53.009]  We all eat sugars, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[02:04:53.209 --> 02:04:59.394]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[02:04:59.654 --> 02:05:05.318]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[02:05:05.558 --> 02:05:11.062]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[02:05:11.323 --> 02:05:15.166]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[02:05:15.186 --> 02:05:20.450]  A one month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95 and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[02:05:20.650 --> 02:05:20.830]  Call 877-817-9829.

[02:05:27.455 --> 02:05:31.657]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[02:05:31.837 --> 02:05:34.778]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place!
[02:05:34.938 --> 02:05:39.881]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[02:05:40.081 --> 02:05:42.502]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[02:05:46.584 --> 02:05:52.626]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.227 --> 02:05:56.188]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.762 --> 02:06:08.585]  Alright, 8 minutes, 20 seconds into this third hour on this Monday, live edition.
[02:06:10.125 --> 02:06:16.728]  We've got Colonel Roberts with us for about 22 more minutes, then I'm gonna get into more detail on the new developments in the London bombing.
[02:06:17.129 --> 02:06:19.630]  Why am I spending so much time on this and not Karl Rove?
[02:06:20.330 --> 02:06:29.274]  Karl Rove is a puppet that can be replaced overnight, then it'll be a big false victory and, oh, we defeated evil, when Karl Rove is nothing.
[02:06:30.686 --> 02:06:41.272]  But this London bombing clearly is being used as a smoke screen, as a pretext for police state, and the evidence all points towards government orchestration.
[02:06:41.312 --> 02:06:45.615]  That is, a criminal element of the government orchestrating it.
[02:06:46.595 --> 02:06:48.637]  So many people say, Alex, you think the government did it?
[02:06:48.657 --> 02:06:48.917]  No, no, no.
[02:06:49.277 --> 02:06:51.038]  Criminal elements in the government.
[02:06:51.573 --> 02:06:56.995]  You know, it's like when some guy who works for the Commerce Department steals two million dollars worth of computers.
[02:06:57.395 --> 02:07:02.917]  I'm not saying everyone at the Commerce Department is a thief, but there are people, you know, they get caught all the time stealing.
[02:07:03.598 --> 02:07:04.058]  Okay?
[02:07:04.158 --> 02:07:09.440]  I'm talking about people in powerful positions in government who are cold-blooded killers, folks.
[02:07:09.900 --> 02:07:16.042]  They see blowing up an airplane or flying stuff into buildings or bombing buses as collateral damage.
[02:07:16.443 --> 02:07:17.103]  They're killers.
[02:07:18.050 --> 02:07:23.372]  Most of the people running our government, the Negropontes and people like that, were death squad leaders.
[02:07:23.412 --> 02:07:28.654]  I mean, these guys have been doing this since they were, you know, back in the 60s, they were hit men.
[02:07:29.334 --> 02:07:29.674]  You know?
[02:07:30.074 --> 02:07:31.775]  I mean, these guys have been around, folks.
[02:07:31.815 --> 02:07:32.835]  It means nothing to them.
[02:07:34.276 --> 02:07:36.516]  I mean, they're very vicious.
[02:07:37.697 --> 02:07:39.277]  And they want to take your way of life.
[02:07:40.358 --> 02:07:40.998]  It's real simple.
[02:07:41.958 --> 02:07:44.059]  William in Texas, you're on the air with Craig Roberts.
[02:07:44.079 --> 02:07:44.399]  Go ahead.
[02:07:45.386 --> 02:07:51.869]  Yes, Mr. Jones, I have a question pertaining to being fingerprinted for state ID cards.
[02:07:52.029 --> 02:07:52.309]  Yes.
[02:07:52.910 --> 02:07:59.533]  And my question is, is there a way to refuse being fingerprinted due to religious beliefs?
[02:08:00.342 --> 02:08:04.384]  No, and Texas was one of the first states to put biometrics in in 93.
[02:08:05.104 --> 02:08:06.864]  I was arrested protesting it in 97.
[02:08:06.904 --> 02:08:10.546]  That's in my film, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:08:10.926 --> 02:08:11.786]  Right.
[02:08:11.806 --> 02:08:14.427]  So there's nothing I can do.
[02:08:14.727 --> 02:08:17.608]  I'm going to have to get my fingerprint to get the state ID.
[02:08:17.648 --> 02:08:21.710]  Yeah, because they've got to have it, because see that same thumbprint is going in the tanning salons.
[02:08:22.330 --> 02:08:27.632]  The grocery stores, Disney World, Disneyland, Sea World, everywhere.
[02:08:27.692 --> 02:08:30.032]  I mean, already, sir, in Austin.
[02:08:30.453 --> 02:08:32.853]  Five years ago, I couldn't have found anywhere that had thumb scanners.
[02:08:32.893 --> 02:08:37.775]  Now in Austin, check cashing places, tanning salons, gyms,
[02:08:38.779 --> 02:08:45.242]  You know, everywhere, they're putting the biometrics in that then track and trace everywhere you go.
[02:08:45.642 --> 02:08:50.704]  Even when you pay cash, they're going to make you do this because, quote, it's going to be the new national sales tax.
[02:08:51.204 --> 02:08:55.146]  And that new national sales tax is going to be graduated according to your income.
[02:08:55.186 --> 02:08:58.347]  So we've got to make sure, you know, that you're in the right tax bracket.
[02:08:58.387 --> 02:09:00.468]  But really, it brings tracking and control.
[02:09:00.568 --> 02:09:02.849]  And then, if you're not a good globalist,
[02:09:03.763 --> 02:09:05.944]  You think no right to fly is bad?
[02:09:06.284 --> 02:09:08.785]  Oh, sorry, you're on the terror watch list or the crime watch list.
[02:09:09.045 --> 02:09:11.346]  Well, now, sorry, you can't buy a loaf of bread.
[02:09:11.926 --> 02:09:12.966]  And that's in the Patriot Act.
[02:09:12.986 --> 02:09:15.387]  You know, you can't do business with somebody on the watch list.
[02:09:15.767 --> 02:09:16.507]  Oh, sorry!
[02:09:16.848 --> 02:09:19.168]  In fact, I've got an alert here to call the police on you.
[02:09:19.368 --> 02:09:20.449]  Colonel Roberts comments.
[02:09:21.709 --> 02:09:32.613]  Well, you know, I had a phone call from a friend who's a school teacher, and she said, I don't want to give them my thumbprint scan on the driver's license here in Oklahoma, and they're requiring that now.
[02:09:33.454 --> 02:09:38.778]  And I said, well, that's part of it, but get ready because eventually they're going to go to the chip.
[02:09:38.818 --> 02:09:40.299]  And I had explained what that was all about.
[02:09:40.699 --> 02:09:44.882]  But this national idea... By the way, I'm having a senior moment, but last week I never covered it.
[02:09:45.282 --> 02:09:55.009]  A governor last week got a chip, and then somebody in a federal... a member of the cabinet got a chip last week, and I didn't even read it on air.
[02:09:55.069 --> 02:09:57.050]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:09:57.070 --> 02:10:00.193]  We're getting people that are volunteering to say, I don't see anything wrong with it.
[02:10:00.253 --> 02:10:00.793]  I'd take one.
[02:10:01.423 --> 02:10:03.025]  And it's just absolutely incredible.
[02:10:03.386 --> 02:10:04.608]  Let's see how this works now.
[02:10:04.728 --> 02:10:07.372]  Gotta have the thumbprint or no job.
[02:10:08.854 --> 02:10:12.319]  Under federal regulations, gotta have the ID card to get a job.
[02:10:12.339 --> 02:10:14.162]  That's why I'm getting the card.
[02:10:14.182 --> 02:10:15.664]  That's why I have to get the card.
[02:10:15.764 --> 02:10:16.285]  It's for a job.
[02:10:18.357 --> 02:10:20.197]  This is what we're fighting.
[02:10:20.257 --> 02:10:26.299]  Listen, you're going to be paying a new national sales tax on top of an income tax in the next five years.
[02:10:26.739 --> 02:10:31.020]  You're going to have a transponder in your inspection sticker tracking you.
[02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:33.541]  And your life's not going to get better, by the way.
[02:10:33.561 --> 02:10:34.381]  It's going to get worse.
[02:10:36.481 --> 02:10:38.482]  I've been keeping up with this for the last ten years.
[02:10:38.502 --> 02:10:43.563]  I'm well aware of what's going on, and I'm preparing to get myself out of the United States.
[02:10:45.037 --> 02:10:46.178]  Well, I don't even know if that'll help.
[02:10:46.478 --> 02:10:55.404]  You know, you'll go to a third world country where there's no technology, but eventually everybody's going to end up, you know... Yeah, Brazil and Argentina, they've already put them in.
[02:10:55.424 --> 02:10:56.885]  Brazil has put them in?
[02:10:57.805 --> 02:11:00.107]  Yeah, and... Yes.
[02:11:00.127 --> 02:11:02.088]  Dang, that's aggravating.
[02:11:02.228 --> 02:11:03.029]  That's where I was headed.
[02:11:03.649 --> 02:11:04.289]  Well, look at Costa Rica.
[02:11:06.291 --> 02:11:10.415]  Costa Rica is a pretty good place to head and still good for expats.
[02:11:10.655 --> 02:11:13.457]  But, Colonel, last year they started thumbprinting.
[02:11:13.938 --> 02:11:14.518]  Costa Rica did?
[02:11:14.858 --> 02:11:15.098]  Yes.
[02:11:15.779 --> 02:11:18.621]  Well, Shazam, do like me, buy a sailboat and head for sea.
[02:11:19.882 --> 02:11:21.824]  What happens if you don't have a fingerprint?
[02:11:22.164 --> 02:11:26.608]  Say you're a bricklayer and you keep your fingerprints rubbed off wearing brick all the time.
[02:11:27.288 --> 02:11:28.629]  It will be selectively enforced.
[02:11:28.669 --> 02:11:29.530]  The illegal aliens
[02:11:30.367 --> 02:11:32.949]  Are allowed to get loans, bank accounts with no IDs.
[02:11:32.989 --> 02:11:33.730]  This is all admitted.
[02:11:33.770 --> 02:11:35.591]  The corporations are told this.
[02:11:36.252 --> 02:11:38.033]  Citizens, it's enforced on.
[02:11:38.053 --> 02:11:41.737]  Well, let me tell you what it's going to come down to, say, in ten years.
[02:11:41.817 --> 02:11:49.023]  The government will carry out terror attacks and claim that a Christian group against chips and against biometrics is behind it.
[02:11:49.483 --> 02:11:54.447]  Then, anyone who's against it will be fingered as being part of the terrorists.
[02:11:54.968 --> 02:11:56.489]  Thus, you've got to go to a camp
[02:11:57.029 --> 02:12:01.834]  And we all can't pay for the people at the camp, so you're going to have to work to pay for your food.
[02:12:02.174 --> 02:12:06.638]  And Michael Savage is calling for that, except he just says for those that disagree with the administration.
[02:12:07.098 --> 02:12:09.300]  So, Colonel, do you agree with that analysis?
[02:12:09.340 --> 02:12:13.184]  Yeah, and don't forget, also, they're going to retina scans and they're going to DNA.
[02:12:13.934 --> 02:12:18.739]  So, your DNA will be on file because, you know, your body might show up someplace and they won't be able to identify it.
[02:12:19.239 --> 02:12:21.321]  We've got these pedophiles out here preying on children.
[02:12:21.341 --> 02:12:22.423]  We've got to get their DNA.
[02:12:22.483 --> 02:12:24.425]  We're getting the DNA of everybody that's ever been arrested.
[02:12:24.445 --> 02:12:29.189]  We're getting the DNA of everybody that's going in the military because, I mean, they might get shot down and we have to go dig their bones up later.
[02:12:29.209 --> 02:12:31.872]  Well, by the way, in England, they're just going to start DNAing everybody.
[02:12:32.132 --> 02:12:33.093]  Yeah, and we will too.
[02:12:33.954 --> 02:12:34.495]  It'll happen.
[02:12:34.675 --> 02:12:35.896]  You're going to get your driver's license.
[02:12:35.916 --> 02:12:36.757]  You give them a mouth swab.
[02:12:37.851 --> 02:12:46.659]  I've worked for myself all my life and I've worked very hard to keep myself off of government computers.
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:53.645]  Basically, I would say the only thing on government computers is probably my social security card as far as banking, driving.
[02:12:53.725 --> 02:12:55.747]  I've drove with an international driver's license.
[02:12:56.487 --> 02:12:59.290]  Uh, and I've worked real hard to do this.
[02:12:59.330 --> 02:13:02.172]  Well look, they're making it, sir, I gotta let you go because we've got loaded phones.
[02:13:02.432 --> 02:13:05.315]  They're making it where you cannot get around it.
[02:13:05.335 --> 02:13:07.577]  If you want to talk more about it, William, you can call me back tomorrow.
[02:13:08.037 --> 02:13:13.402]  They're making it where there's no way, listen, they're even trying to pass laws where let's say you own a piece of property.
[02:13:13.722 --> 02:13:15.103]  You gotta pay the property tax on it.
[02:13:15.564 --> 02:13:20.568]  Now they're gonna want it, not just a check from you, but they're gonna want an updated license when you go and pay it.
[02:13:21.616 --> 02:13:21.876]  See?
[02:13:22.316 --> 02:13:24.117]  Oh, we're not accepting your check now.
[02:13:24.818 --> 02:13:26.539]  You've got to come and present that in person.
[02:13:27.079 --> 02:13:29.640]  Or with a photocopy of your driver's license.
[02:13:30.121 --> 02:13:33.142]  Sorry, we're taking your prop... Craig, this is scary.
[02:13:33.522 --> 02:13:33.742]  Oh, I know.
[02:13:33.803 --> 02:13:34.463]  It's incredible.
[02:13:34.803 --> 02:13:40.566]  You know, I'm always a proponent against property tax to begin with, but we won't go down that rapid trail right now.
[02:13:42.287 --> 02:13:47.770]  But the whole thing is that Dr. Frankenstein in the castle
[02:13:48.430 --> 02:13:52.774]  He fears the peasants with a pitchfork, so therefore he wants us to be intimidated.
[02:13:53.094 --> 02:13:55.656]  He wants us to be totally identifiable.
[02:13:55.696 --> 02:13:56.857]  You can't hide any place.
[02:13:56.917 --> 02:13:58.399]  You know, you can run, but you can't hide.
[02:13:58.579 --> 02:14:01.841]  But the government has a mantle of total secrecy around itself.
[02:14:01.861 --> 02:14:09.368]  Sure, and you know, it's like, it's a felony to lie to a federal agent, but they can lie to you all they want, nothing happens.
[02:14:10.898 --> 02:14:13.939]  I mean, it's becoming an us and them deal.
[02:14:14.199 --> 02:14:21.221]  And it's just like in old feudal England, they have more rights because they work for the king than you the citizen.
[02:14:21.261 --> 02:14:22.821]  We are now becoming subjects.
[02:14:23.382 --> 02:14:24.302]  Well, and suspects.
[02:14:25.522 --> 02:14:29.383]  Subjects and suspects, because everybody out here... That's great.
[02:14:30.083 --> 02:14:34.365]  By making everybody a suspect, guilty until proven innocent, we all become subjects.
[02:14:34.885 --> 02:14:35.625]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:14:36.523 --> 02:14:38.605]  And we also feel intimidated for it.
[02:14:38.845 --> 02:14:40.506]  You know, I don't want them looking at me twice.
[02:14:40.666 --> 02:14:43.168]  I don't want, you know, I'm going to keep my head straight ahead in line.
[02:14:43.529 --> 02:14:44.870]  I don't want anybody to notice me.
[02:14:44.950 --> 02:14:46.291]  And then they train the cops!
[02:14:46.531 --> 02:14:49.413]  Then they train the cops that anybody that acts like that is probably a criminal.
[02:14:49.693 --> 02:14:53.016]  They see everybody act like that to them, and the cop thinks, man, they must all be criminals.
[02:14:53.516 --> 02:14:55.178]  Yeah, it's the S&M thing.
[02:14:56.078 --> 02:14:58.120]  You know, I saw it for years in the military.
[02:14:58.180 --> 02:14:59.701]  I saw it for years in government service.
[02:14:59.721 --> 02:15:01.623]  You know, I look at police all the time.
[02:15:01.763 --> 02:15:03.144]  I make a habit of it, and a lot of them
[02:15:03.976 --> 02:15:04.677]  I don't think so.
[02:15:22.393 --> 02:15:26.034]  You know, once out in that car, you know, you're not a person anymore.
[02:15:26.094 --> 02:15:27.375]  You're a driver in a van.
[02:15:27.435 --> 02:15:32.876]  I want them to know they're helping flush their children's fusions down the toilet if they go along with this.
[02:15:32.936 --> 02:15:35.817]  And just know that you're going to put your children in hell.
[02:15:36.497 --> 02:15:38.818]  Let's talk to Reggie in New Jersey.
[02:15:38.858 --> 02:15:39.698]  Thanks for holding, Reggie.
[02:15:39.718 --> 02:15:40.119]  Go ahead.
[02:15:40.359 --> 02:15:41.039]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:15:41.259 --> 02:15:41.479]  Good.
[02:15:41.499 --> 02:15:43.159]  I want to thank you for all the work that you're doing.
[02:15:43.199 --> 02:15:44.580]  I think that you're a true patron.
[02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:46.541]  Just tell you, don't get burned out too much.
[02:15:46.781 --> 02:15:47.661]  I'm not burned out, man.
[02:15:47.902 --> 02:15:48.202]  Okay.
[02:15:48.522 --> 02:15:56.086]  I'm calling to comment on the searching of public transportation passengers in New York and I want to testify that it's also happening in New Jersey, here where I live.
[02:15:56.126 --> 02:16:02.229]  I woke up on the, uh, this morning was all over the news and basically my question to you is how do we handle this?
[02:16:02.289 --> 02:16:08.392]  Cause it seems like it's getting to the point where it's a literal, physical, um, infringement upon our rights.
[02:16:08.472 --> 02:16:08.992]  Well, it is.
[02:16:09.052 --> 02:16:13.955]  And again, it's not gonna, I mean, if you had a real suicide bomber, he's going to go, I'm running and go.
[02:16:14.815 --> 02:16:15.796]  You're not going to stop him.
[02:16:16.296 --> 02:16:24.080]  Searching five-year-old girls is just meant to get us all used to being controlled and ordered up against the wall like Craig said in the last hour.
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:25.541]  I wanted to bring up one point.
[02:16:25.941 --> 02:16:26.982]  I'm an African-American.
[02:16:27.702 --> 02:16:41.489]  Not that it matters too much in this discussion, but my point is the blacks went through something that is reminding me of what is happening right now where their civil rights were just physically, there was a hand-on-hand combat.
[02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:44.411]  They had to stand up and say, no, I'm not going to go
[02:16:45.447 --> 02:16:47.889]  No, I'm not going to drink from a separate water fountain.
[02:16:47.909 --> 02:16:48.790]  He had to get hoes.
[02:16:49.330 --> 02:16:50.571]  He had to get bit by the dog.
[02:16:50.711 --> 02:16:52.552]  And the government knows we're going to fight back.
[02:16:52.592 --> 02:16:56.434]  That's why they've got the riot police ready, the microwave guns, the sound cannons.
[02:16:56.475 --> 02:16:58.636]  Colonel Roberts, comments on what Reggie's saying?
[02:16:59.356 --> 02:17:01.218]  Well, yeah, he's exactly right.
[02:17:01.438 --> 02:17:02.879]  And we're seeing that now.
[02:17:02.979 --> 02:17:04.300]  It's an ever-tightening vice.
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:06.441]  And the American people are caught in it.
[02:17:07.006 --> 02:17:11.530]  And they're doing it under the guise of national security, which is one of the oldest swaths there is.
[02:17:11.550 --> 02:17:15.212]  Well, we've had a lot of police calling in saying that they're going to say no to the searches.
[02:17:16.053 --> 02:17:29.223]  Well, and I've talked to a lot of officers that say, you know, they're not going along with it either because they can see it coming down the pike to where eventually the police will be disarmed by the federal police or they'll become part of the federal police with cross-deputization and one thing will lead to another and pretty soon there won't be a way to fight back.
[02:17:30.180 --> 02:17:33.164]  And they see that coming, and they don't want their family caught in it either.
[02:17:33.425 --> 02:17:34.406]  Reggie, anything else?
[02:17:34.627 --> 02:17:36.850]  Yeah, African Americans did win the race.
[02:17:36.890 --> 02:17:37.651]  Let's not forget that.
[02:17:37.731 --> 02:17:39.554]  Alright.
[02:17:39.894 --> 02:17:40.335]  Anything else?
[02:17:40.675 --> 02:17:41.176]  No, that's all.
[02:17:41.336 --> 02:17:41.637]  Thank you.

[02:19:38.945 --> 02:19:39.386]  Currency devaluation.
[02:19:39.406 --> 02:19:39.866]  Inflation.
[02:19:40.106 --> 02:19:40.967]  One and the same.
[02:19:41.087 --> 02:19:48.134]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:20:03.334 --> 02:20:06.456]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:20:06.916 --> 02:20:09.578]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:20:09.618 --> 02:20:12.540]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:13.080 --> 02:20:16.102]  Here is reality.
[02:20:16.462 --> 02:20:20.524]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:20:21.145 --> 02:20:24.827]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.

[02:21:40.941 --> 02:21:58.667]  Alright, folks, we're gonna have the Colonel with us a little bit into the next segment for about the next 15 minutes or so.
[02:21:58.947 --> 02:22:03.108]  I wanna get into the suitcase nuke threat, which, don't get me wrong, it's very, very real.
[02:22:04.528 --> 02:22:07.630]  But the government trying to say that, you know, MS-13's behind it.
[02:22:07.650 --> 02:22:09.851]  Well, if they are, they're working for the globalists.
[02:22:10.312 --> 02:22:12.353]  Or that, you know, Al-Qaeda's about to get us any minute.
[02:22:12.673 --> 02:22:15.555]  If they got nukes, it's because the overlords wanted them to.
[02:22:16.295 --> 02:22:20.118]  And I really have seen them setting up this scenario for a long time, and it's very scary.
[02:22:20.138 --> 02:22:22.299]  I don't have to tell you that.
[02:22:22.339 --> 02:22:22.859]  I mean, come on.
[02:22:23.640 --> 02:22:24.921]  Jeff in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:22:24.961 --> 02:22:25.521]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:22:29.796 --> 02:22:33.961]  ...on these new private intelligence services such as Inter4...
[02:22:34.955 --> 02:22:41.979]  And one right here in Austin, whose clients include the Department of Homeland Security, the Air Force, the Navy... Yeah, Dying Corps, but they got a new name.
[02:22:41.999 --> 02:22:42.619]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:22:42.739 --> 02:22:43.520]  Stratfor.
[02:22:43.540 --> 02:22:44.740]  Oh, yeah, Stratfor.
[02:22:44.901 --> 02:22:45.841]  Who are these guys?
[02:22:45.901 --> 02:22:46.441]  What do they do?
[02:22:46.501 --> 02:22:47.202]  How do they fit in?
[02:22:47.382 --> 02:22:48.162]  Well, let me stop you.
[02:22:48.583 --> 02:22:50.504]  You weren't talking at first when we went to you.
[02:22:50.664 --> 02:22:50.924]  I gotcha.
[02:22:51.224 --> 02:22:52.305]  And then you were talking, and Ms.
[02:22:52.345 --> 02:22:54.506]  Freeman, we didn't fade you up, so I missed what you said.
[02:22:54.926 --> 02:22:56.127]  Private intelligence groups.
[02:22:56.147 --> 02:23:02.110]  I thought you were talking about merc groups who actually go out and physically do things around the world.
[02:23:02.290 --> 02:23:09.714]  No, I'm talking about these companies like Stratfor that provide subscription intelligence services to corporations and the CFR, according to their website.
[02:23:09.754 --> 02:23:18.158]  Yeah, really what I think of Stratfor and all these other groups is, because I've read their intelligence and seen it, the government can't get its own analyst
[02:23:20.499 --> 02:23:24.941]  To put out the type of false intelligence and fear-mongering that they want.
[02:23:25.261 --> 02:23:35.825]  So what they do is they subscribe to a myriad of these intelligence services that put out the type of propaganda that they want.
[02:23:36.345 --> 02:23:39.927]  And that's my opinion of that doctor that runs this thing locally.
[02:23:39.947 --> 02:23:40.887]  Yeah, George Friedman.
[02:23:40.907 --> 02:23:45.389]  I read his book and it's an absolute joke that just purveys the whole al-Qaeda legend.
[02:23:45.509 --> 02:23:47.089]  No, I mean a two-year-old...
[02:23:48.650 --> 02:23:49.290]  Let's be serious.
[02:23:49.370 --> 02:23:51.511]  An informed 8-year-old could cut him to pieces.
[02:23:51.731 --> 02:23:53.712]  By the way, he will not come on this show and debate me.
[02:23:54.152 --> 02:23:54.812]  Oh, what a wuss.
[02:23:55.132 --> 02:23:57.953]  But, I mean, yeah, but this goes deeper than just ignorance.
[02:23:57.993 --> 02:24:01.334]  But, uh, Colonel, I mean, do you have comments about all these little propaganda groups?
[02:24:01.635 --> 02:24:11.598]  Yeah, you know, uh, uh, Goring said that, well, no, I'm sorry, Himmler said that, uh, that, uh, the truth is what we say it is, and he also said that
[02:24:12.219 --> 02:24:16.982]  People will believe anything as long as it's 90% truth and 10% lie.
[02:24:17.382 --> 02:24:23.286]  So what you have to do, a lot of the stuff that these people come up with is good factual data, but you can also find it any place else.
[02:24:23.727 --> 02:24:27.129]  They just glean it from some place and then they add and salt and pepper this thing
[02:24:27.549 --> 02:24:32.972]  A few little things in there that you think, well, if all of this other stuff's right, and everybody else is saying it, then it's all right.
[02:24:33.092 --> 02:24:34.973]  And then you end up believing the lies as well.
[02:24:35.333 --> 02:24:35.513]  Right.
[02:24:35.553 --> 02:24:37.114]  Boy, that's a really important point.
[02:24:37.174 --> 02:24:38.154]  Go ahead and finish up, Jeff.
[02:24:38.274 --> 02:24:47.679]  Yeah, I was just going to say, in his book, The George Treatment, he basically admits that Al-Qaeda got all of its crucial data from the Saudi Intelligence Service, the Pakistani ISI, and the CIA.
[02:24:48.319 --> 02:24:49.419]  Well, that's bread and butter.
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:52.641]  The Pakistani ISI is one of the biggest terrorist groups there is.
[02:24:53.226 --> 02:24:54.167]  There you go.
[02:25:09.197 --> 02:25:15.079]  And the same morning of 9-11, he's having breakfast with Goss and Graham, the two intelligence chiefs for the House and Senate.
[02:25:15.599 --> 02:25:16.999]  I mean, Craig, that's pretty obvious.
[02:25:17.099 --> 02:25:33.483]  Well, the ISI were supporters of all the Mujahideen training camps that the CIA gave away when we pulled out of Afghanistan, and they went over to the Mujahideen and began, well, they didn't have to fight the Russians anymore, so they turned them into training camps for Islamic terrorist groups on contract.
[02:25:33.503 --> 02:25:35.503]  They're the DynCorp of Islam.
[02:25:37.749 --> 02:25:42.232]  The Dying Corps of Islam, though, is directly linked and funded, still, by the U.S.
[02:25:42.252 --> 02:25:43.974]  government through Prez Musharraf.
[02:25:45.355 --> 02:25:49.058]  Yeah, you know, like we've always said, just follow the money, you'll find the power.
[02:25:49.578 --> 02:25:56.064]  I'd just be curious if groups like StatsTrap or the Provide Alert had any interesting alerts in the days leading up to 7-7.
[02:25:56.484 --> 02:25:57.565]  You know, I don't really care.
[02:25:57.625 --> 02:25:58.406]  I mean, frankly,
[02:25:59.947 --> 02:26:03.650]  I mean, again, I hate to use this term, but it seems like those people are retarded.
[02:26:04.871 --> 02:26:06.172]  No, but seriously, thanks for the call.
[02:26:06.753 --> 02:26:14.760]  Yeah, you can sit around and shoot your mouth off about intelligence and knowing what you're talking about, and you can say it all in a very authoritative way.
[02:26:15.240 --> 02:26:20.404]  We don't put a bunch of embellishment on it, or we don't act like we're fancy and puff ourselves up.
[02:26:20.785 --> 02:26:23.727]  What Colonel Roberts has done, it's a track record.
[02:26:24.028 --> 02:26:28.051]  Number one, you don't just trust somebody out of the gates, it's track records with people.
[02:26:28.431 --> 02:26:30.132]  It's track records with information.
[02:26:30.412 --> 02:26:36.076]  And it always goes like a road map from the past activities of these intelligence agencies and these groups.
[02:26:36.516 --> 02:26:38.457]  We go off their past MO.
[02:26:38.738 --> 02:26:42.560]  We go off their standard operating procedure.
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:43.561]  Isn't that important, Colonel?
[02:26:44.301 --> 02:26:45.582]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:26:45.842 --> 02:26:48.343]  You have to trust and verify your source.
[02:26:49.124 --> 02:26:50.905]  And you trust him by verifying.
[02:26:51.285 --> 02:26:52.206]  Like you say, a track record.
[02:26:52.446 --> 02:26:53.947]  How good has a source been in the past?
[02:26:54.774 --> 02:26:56.175]  Uh, would I trust it with my life?
[02:26:56.475 --> 02:26:59.076]  Uh, what have they done in the past that's proved true?
[02:26:59.436 --> 02:27:00.816]  And then try to shoot holes in it.
[02:27:00.856 --> 02:27:02.617]  I mean, I tell people, don't believe anything I say.
[02:27:03.277 --> 02:27:04.098]  Go check it out.
[02:27:04.198 --> 02:27:06.899]  I'll try to give you the truth as I know it, and then go check it out.
[02:27:06.999 --> 02:27:08.279]  Read my book, The Medusa File.
[02:27:08.399 --> 02:27:09.940]  I'll tell you, don't believe anything in it.
[02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:12.321]  But you can go down to the library and look up about 80% of it.
[02:27:13.601 --> 02:27:14.181]  Exactly.
[02:27:14.261 --> 02:27:14.682]  Stay there.
[02:27:14.722 --> 02:27:18.383]  We're going to talk to Jason and then talk about suitcase nukes and let you get out of here, Colonel.
[02:27:18.403 --> 02:27:19.884]  And I'll cover some other news.
[02:27:20.464 --> 02:27:20.924]  Bye, Tom.
[02:27:21.914 --> 02:27:26.097]  Yeah, I want you to check out what I'm saying because you'll find out I'm telling the truth.
[02:27:26.878 --> 02:27:28.779]  And every once in a while, I make a mistake.
[02:27:29.059 --> 02:27:29.900]  I want to be 100%.
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:32.522]  You guys help us do a better job.
[02:27:36.024 --> 02:27:36.945]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.425 --> 02:27:39.026]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.046 --> 02:27:42.629]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.722 --> 02:27:54.565]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:27:54.845 --> 02:27:57.206]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:27:57.466 --> 02:27:59.407]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:27:59.748 --> 02:28:05.110]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:28:05.490 --> 02:28:09.774]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.

[02:28:18.320 --> 02:28:23.364]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[02:28:23.384 --> 02:28:25.386]  military and numerous other government agencies.

[02:28:49.361 --> 02:28:49.881]  are located?
[02:28:50.081 --> 02:28:53.463]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:28:53.683 --> 02:28:58.385]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[02:29:52.121 --> 02:29:52.942]  Read the labels.
[02:29:53.362 --> 02:29:57.505]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:29:57.705 --> 02:30:01.908]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[02:30:56.977 --> 02:31:03.400]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:31:04.440 --> 02:31:13.164]  Going to take a few more calls from Jason, Ron, and Jamie, I believe, or Jeremy, and then that's going to be it because I've got a few other news items I want to hit on.
[02:31:14.285 --> 02:31:16.826]  But talking to Colonel Craig Roberts of RifleWarrior.com,
[02:31:18.866 --> 02:31:45.449]  Craig, we know that the New World Order, that again, owns our government, owns all the other major governments, a few rogue countries they don't own, whether that country is good or bad, they're being taken over, they want population reduction, they want control, we all know this, they want to not be rivaled by any free individuals out there, we know they stand to gain from terrorism, and for now, 14 years, since the fall of the Soviet Union, which never really fell, folks,
[02:31:46.135 --> 02:31:56.123]  It just went into total receivership with the Rothschilds, and now it's come out that the six oligarchs who supposedly own Russia, all of them are really holding stock for Lord Jacob Rothschild.
[02:31:56.143 --> 02:31:57.784]  That's even been in the Financial Times of London.
[02:31:58.184 --> 02:32:08.452]  You know, they go raid the big oil company, the oil monopoly, and the supposed private guy that owns it, one of the oligarchs, it turns out he's a Rothschild agent, and Lord Rothschild laughs and says, I live in England.
[02:32:09.416 --> 02:32:11.137]  So, it comes down to that.
[02:32:11.598 --> 02:32:19.863]  They're releasing nukes, and they sell them for $5 to Al-Qaeda, and Al-Qaeda is going to nuke us, and this stuff was brought across.
[02:32:20.263 --> 02:32:24.606]  Believe me, folks, this doesn't happen unless the global interests want that to happen.
[02:32:24.626 --> 02:32:28.268]  And Craig, give us the intel that you have on this and where you think it's going.
[02:32:28.829 --> 02:32:32.511]  Well, you know, there's two threats that we have on nuclear.
[02:32:33.107 --> 02:32:34.708]  Uh, that are here.
[02:32:35.288 --> 02:32:46.955]  One of them is, as we know, through our briefings in the past in the military, that Spetsnaz, which is the Russian Special Forces during the Cold War, had pre-positioned suitcase nukes in this country.
[02:32:47.935 --> 02:32:50.016]  We knew that there was probably around 50 of them.
[02:32:50.176 --> 02:32:56.680]  That's what we're told by one of the KGB generals who defected over here, besides other sources as well.
[02:32:57.449 --> 02:32:59.813]  They're in near major cities.
[02:32:59.873 --> 02:33:09.448]  Now, these are not gigantic atom bombs that have mushroom clouds, but they are sufficient enough to take about eight or ten city blocks out and contaminate the area for, you know, years and years.
[02:33:10.006 --> 02:33:12.087]  And they will put some fallout into the atmosphere.
[02:33:12.488 --> 02:33:15.810]  But what they have is a gigantic terror advantage.
[02:33:15.930 --> 02:33:27.697]  If you have one in every city for 50 cities, or 20 cities, or 10 cities even, and then, you know, you blow one a day, or you blow all of them in one day, and now... The emergency response can't deal with it.
[02:33:28.057 --> 02:33:30.358]  It kills tens of thousands each time it happens.
[02:33:30.418 --> 02:33:31.639]  It causes hysteria.
[02:33:31.959 --> 02:33:33.540]  The markets would totally tank.
[02:33:33.880 --> 02:33:35.662]  The cities would go into lockdown.
[02:33:36.082 --> 02:33:37.883]  Martial law would immediately be declared.
[02:33:38.705 --> 02:33:42.127]  We don't have any troops here to handle martial law because they're all deployed overseas.
[02:33:42.768 --> 02:33:44.709]  But you've had family in the military briefings.
[02:33:45.349 --> 02:33:47.410]  Currently, you've been in the briefings.
[02:33:47.831 --> 02:33:52.293]  Tommy Franks has said it on Fox TV and in Cigar Fishing Auto Magazine.
[02:33:52.734 --> 02:33:53.734]  Other generals have said it.
[02:33:53.794 --> 02:33:54.575]  I saw a U.N.
[02:33:54.635 --> 02:33:59.277]  general, seven days after 9-11, say we'll use U.N.
[02:33:59.317 --> 02:33:59.658]  troops.
[02:33:59.698 --> 02:34:03.020]  American forces are tied down in a foreign war.
[02:34:03.080 --> 02:34:04.561]  We will use international forces.
[02:34:05.561 --> 02:34:14.550]  And the only army big enough to do that right now is the Chinese Army, who's pre-positioned troops in Mexico already and unloaded tons of military equipment there and in the Bahamas.
[02:34:14.951 --> 02:34:16.913]  We also have Russia backing up the Chinese.
[02:34:17.390 --> 02:34:21.634]  And we have trained them at Fort Polk, Louisiana, on how to counter a seizure.
[02:34:21.654 --> 02:34:24.777]  But obviously, and folks, this is insane, but things are insane.
[02:34:25.158 --> 02:34:26.519]  Okay, this really is going on.
[02:34:26.539 --> 02:34:28.721]  They really are putting cockroach genes in tomatoes.
[02:34:29.001 --> 02:34:30.943]  They really are putting deadly poisons in your water.
[02:34:31.244 --> 02:34:33.326]  They really are trying to force drug your children.
[02:34:33.526 --> 02:34:35.588]  They really did rule that there's no private property.
[02:34:35.628 --> 02:34:37.590]  The Supreme Court, I mean, this stuff is real.
[02:34:39.331 --> 02:34:44.616]  Again, for those who don't understand this, communism is a creation of the globalists to consolidate power.
[02:34:44.656 --> 02:34:45.517]  This could happen.
[02:34:45.817 --> 02:34:52.343]  The globalists could decide, that's why they're kind of looting America right now, to pop us like an overripe tomato.
[02:34:52.623 --> 02:34:54.625]  But don't look for the Chinese to be attacking us.
[02:34:54.905 --> 02:34:56.707]  They'll be welcomed in, won't they, Colonel?
[02:34:56.747 --> 02:34:57.728]  No, they'll be asked to come in.
[02:34:57.748 --> 02:34:58.728]  We'll help transport them.
[02:34:59.289 --> 02:35:02.011]  I mean, this is, you know, one thing after another is happening right now.
[02:35:02.071 --> 02:35:05.454]  Henry Kissinger said that in Avignon, France at the Bilderberg Group in 91.
[02:35:07.610 --> 02:35:14.553]  What's happening is, it's an exponential equation of things happening faster every single day now.
[02:35:14.573 --> 02:35:16.814]  It used to be something that would happen once a week or once a month.
[02:35:16.874 --> 02:35:31.320]  Now it's every single day, you turn it on, we've got more troops killed in Baghdad, we've got more bombs going off in Egypt, we've got China doing this, that, and the other, threatening us that they're going to nuke us if we interfere with them going into Taiwan and so on.
[02:35:31.741 --> 02:35:33.761]  And it's happening, it's almost hourly now.
[02:35:33.961 --> 02:35:34.102]  It's 24-7.
[02:35:35.942 --> 02:35:51.758]  By the way, that top general, he's in the top three, debatable if he's number one or number three or whatever, top general, the equivalent of their Joint Chiefs of Staff, they call a press conference, official Chinese government press conference, he says, we'll nuke America, destroy 200 cities, and then our media makes excuses for it.
[02:35:52.659 --> 02:35:54.461]  Oh, they didn't really mean it, they love us.
[02:35:57.505 --> 02:35:58.126]  It's going to happen.
[02:35:58.446 --> 02:36:04.030]  I mean, there's something that's getting ready to break loose, and you know what's... Craig, you've never talked like this before!
[02:36:04.190 --> 02:36:06.671]  Well... No, I've been having you on for about five, six years.
[02:36:06.691 --> 02:36:07.652]  Longer than that now.
[02:36:08.012 --> 02:36:10.294]  You have never said... You've never talked like this!
[02:36:10.494 --> 02:36:11.915]  Well, I see everything happening.
[02:36:11.935 --> 02:36:17.779]  You know, I spent two years working in intelligence to know that all the pieces are up on the wall, and you can see the picture that's forming.
[02:36:17.799 --> 02:36:22.482]  You've got these threats that are being bombarded with that America's Hiroshima is coming.
[02:36:23.214 --> 02:36:31.039]  Now we have, and we were looking at bio, we were looking at chemical, now we found out about these nukes that they've allegedly brought across the border using MS-13 street gang members.
[02:36:31.680 --> 02:36:32.360]  Okay, fine.
[02:36:32.620 --> 02:36:34.081]  Let's put that up on the wall as well.
[02:36:34.582 --> 02:36:37.404]  And we have... You gotta cheat though, that's a cover to blame it on them, right?
[02:36:37.424 --> 02:36:38.985]  Well, it could be, but here's the deal.
[02:36:40.489 --> 02:36:42.411]  August the 6th is coming up.
[02:36:42.771 --> 02:36:44.112]  That's the anniversary of Hiroshima.
[02:36:44.373 --> 02:36:49.617]  There's a lot of intelligence agencies looking at that as a possible date that something's going to happen, because these people love dates.
[02:36:50.137 --> 02:36:50.738]  They love numbers.
[02:36:50.798 --> 02:36:52.919]  I've never heard you put a date on things.
[02:36:52.939 --> 02:36:58.904]  I mean, you're saying... I mean, Craig, I've never heard you talk like this, and now you're putting... You're not putting a date, though.
[02:36:58.924 --> 02:37:04.649]  You're just saying that... I mean, the media and the government is fear-mongering right now, and I saw them do that before 9-11.
[02:37:05.009 --> 02:37:06.971]  So you're saying you're seeing that same type of chatter?
[02:37:07.371 --> 02:37:09.633]  Oh, we're seeing that, but if you look at
[02:37:10.013 --> 02:37:15.695]  How much they like using dates to punctuate with their events, like 9-11 and so on.
[02:37:16.355 --> 02:37:19.016]  Something multiples of seven, something multiples of sixes.
[02:37:19.116 --> 02:37:20.236]  I mean, they love that kind of stuff.
[02:37:20.256 --> 02:37:21.217]  They're into numerology.
[02:37:21.257 --> 02:37:22.857]  It's all satanic.
[02:37:23.478 --> 02:37:33.981]  Well, if you look at 8-6, there's a six in there, but it is the anniversary of Hiroshima, and a few days later, Nagasaki.
[02:37:34.497 --> 02:37:39.939]  So, if you had two of them, what two better days would you... If they don't do it then, I don't know when they would.
[02:37:40.539 --> 02:37:43.461]  It's just incredible that this isn't being mentioned.
[02:37:43.501 --> 02:37:54.265]  If I were in a security position with enough horsepower behind me, I'd have my agents burning up the field trying to find stuff between now and then.
[02:37:55.123 --> 02:37:56.244]  And I don't see anything going on.
[02:37:56.744 --> 02:38:03.809]  Now, when did you first, because I've been hearing a lot of chatter on this, I mean, again, Craig, you've never gone out like this.
[02:38:04.229 --> 02:38:09.752]  I mean, whether it's a month from now or five years from now, I think it is in the cards for the Globalist to pull something off.
[02:38:09.772 --> 02:38:15.936]  I don't know about a suitcase nuke, though I know that they're perfectly capable of it, and they have been fear-mongering.
[02:38:15.996 --> 02:38:19.939]  I mean, the Vice President's been out saying this, and so have me.
[02:38:21.700 --> 02:38:22.621]  Is it a gut hunch?
[02:38:22.661 --> 02:38:24.723]  I mean, you're not saying something's going to happen on the 7th.
[02:38:24.763 --> 02:38:25.483]  No, not at all.
[02:38:25.704 --> 02:38:26.084]  Not at all.
[02:38:26.144 --> 02:38:29.807]  But, you know, we always try to figure out what the guy on the other side of the hill is up to.
[02:38:30.548 --> 02:38:35.472]  And Wellington said that, as a matter of fact, after Waterloo.
[02:38:35.572 --> 02:38:36.533]  Lord Wellington, yeah.
[02:38:36.933 --> 02:38:45.400]  If we figure out that they're into dates, they're into times, and they've been threatening this, and we've been told it's not if but when by our own government,
[02:38:46.067 --> 02:38:47.687]  Then, you know, what better time?
[02:38:47.888 --> 02:38:50.288]  And if not then, what comes up in September?
[02:38:50.488 --> 02:38:51.609]  What comes up in October?
[02:38:51.769 --> 02:38:52.769]  What comes up in November?
[02:38:52.829 --> 02:38:54.389]  Those are the dates you really look at.
[02:38:54.849 --> 02:38:56.710]  Find out anniversary dates of things.
[02:38:56.730 --> 02:38:59.591]  You know, they love this April 19th date.
[02:39:00.171 --> 02:39:03.412]  Going all the way back to the American Revolution, the Reichstag fire, all the rest of it.
[02:39:03.432 --> 02:39:05.853]  They love that April 19th date for domestic stuff.
[02:39:06.553 --> 02:39:08.413]  But the foreigners like these other dates.
[02:39:08.453 --> 02:39:11.134]  They like to say, look, you know, what goes around comes around.
[02:39:11.650 --> 02:39:22.243]  So, I'd have my people beating paths through the jungle between now and the first couple of weeks in August to make sure nothing happened.
[02:39:23.041 --> 02:39:36.263]  Well, Craig, I have no doubt that by exposing the New World Order, by after 9-11 coming out and exposing that inside job, that we did stop the Globalists from carrying out more events.
[02:39:36.764 --> 02:39:45.305]  But then we get into a Catch-22 where if their whole program is being exposed and stalling, they're going to have to have some type of attack to cover up the last attack.
[02:39:45.905 --> 02:39:47.886]  And that's what happened to Oklahoma City.
[02:39:47.906 --> 02:39:50.386]  9-11 put Oklahoma City on the back burner of everybody.
[02:39:50.942 --> 02:40:01.254]  And if it wasn't for guys like Jesse Trinidou, still poking a sharp stick at the Dragon, we wouldn't have the stuff that's come out lately on the things that we talked about with Morris Dees and all of that.
[02:40:01.334 --> 02:40:05.979]  Well, it's like these dummy bombs of last Thursday on the two-week anniversary.
[02:40:06.499 --> 02:40:08.141]  That got off the front pages.
[02:40:08.161 --> 02:40:11.565]  With Scotland Yard going, we think these guys were bad seats.
[02:40:12.882 --> 02:40:21.548]  I mean, it's kind of, well, we know that the FBI cooked the bomb, trained the driver in the World Trade Center bombing, and then that was coming out in the news, and so you have Waco.
[02:40:22.409 --> 02:40:22.609]  Right.
[02:40:22.869 --> 02:40:30.294]  They're always leapfrogging to the next... Well, so Craig, do you think in the next two years, three years, we're going to see a nuke go off?
[02:40:31.095 --> 02:40:34.277]  I think if they've got them, they're going to use them a lot sooner than that.
[02:40:35.458 --> 02:40:37.019]  You know, just, why wouldn't they?
[02:40:37.620 --> 02:40:39.601]  I mean, if they have the capability, they'd use it tomorrow.
[02:40:40.816 --> 02:40:43.217]  Unless they're waiting for a specific date or a specific issue.
[02:40:43.517 --> 02:40:47.718]  But by they, I mean the Russians just didn't sell these for a stick of bubble gum.
[02:40:47.978 --> 02:40:49.739]  Now, they're a couple million a piece, I'm sure.
[02:40:50.619 --> 02:40:55.000]  But we're talking about people who have unlimited funding.
[02:40:55.300 --> 02:40:57.861]  And again, we knew about it in advance.
[02:40:57.921 --> 02:40:58.941]  Why didn't we close the borders?
[02:41:00.151 --> 02:41:01.652]  You know, why didn't we watch the seaports?
[02:41:01.672 --> 02:41:05.754]  We're so worried about airports that we let everything else fall by the wayside.
[02:41:05.874 --> 02:41:17.980]  Well, that's where you got citizens to train us how to be slaves, and all of this has been police state training for when they bring the real martial law in, like my film Police State 2000, where I got Marines in 99 saying, where'd you get the helmet?
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:18.780]  Where'd you get the gun?
[02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:19.300]  Where do you live?
[02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:20.361]  I live in San Francisco.
[02:41:20.841 --> 02:41:23.903]  Breaking us up and putting us in the camp for our safety, of course.
[02:41:24.323 --> 02:41:25.984]  Yeah, and that's another area.
[02:41:26.724 --> 02:41:28.745]  You know, FEMA has bought all that property.
[02:41:29.523 --> 02:41:31.864]  They've got all kinds of real estate that they put infrastructure in.
[02:41:31.884 --> 02:41:32.904]  Yeah, that's mainstream news.
[02:41:32.944 --> 02:41:33.625]  Camps everywhere.
[02:41:33.725 --> 02:41:38.646]  Yeah, camps everywhere for relocation centers in case something goes off in the city, in case there's a disease that breaks out.
[02:41:38.666 --> 02:41:40.967]  Well, Colonel, I know you're going to follow their orders and go with them.
[02:41:41.287 --> 02:41:41.988]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:41:42.048 --> 02:41:46.189]  I've got a hill right now I'm looking at that would be a good place to stay.
[02:41:46.609 --> 02:41:47.630]  But it wouldn't be one of their camps.
[02:41:49.971 --> 02:41:52.011]  Well, I mean, why not go to one of their camps?
[02:41:52.492 --> 02:41:55.753]  Good place to... I've heard they don't have very good officers clubs.
[02:42:00.197 --> 02:42:06.399]  Well, what are you going to do if folks come by the locals and want you to come with them?
[02:42:06.519 --> 02:42:11.380]  After they've hit my trip wire, things will get nasty.
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:16.661]  In England, they call them rest and relocation centers.
[02:42:17.081 --> 02:42:18.161]  Don't you want to go rest?
[02:42:18.461 --> 02:42:20.702]  These facilities are for your safety.
[02:42:20.742 --> 02:42:24.883]  Well, the Nazis had a big sign that work makes you free right over the gate of Auschwitz.
[02:42:27.893 --> 02:42:30.914]  Man, imagine if the Nazis would have had Al-Qaeda to help them along.
[02:42:32.195 --> 02:42:35.056]  Well, we've got to take your rights, because Al-Qaeda is going to get you.
[02:42:35.336 --> 02:42:35.776]  Well, they did.
[02:42:35.796 --> 02:42:36.656]  They called them communists.
[02:42:37.957 --> 02:42:40.138]  Meanwhile, the same banks were funding both sides.
[02:42:40.198 --> 02:42:40.458]  Right.
[02:42:41.318 --> 02:42:42.078]  Oh, heaven help us.
[02:42:42.538 --> 02:42:45.820]  Alright, well, just in case he was calling for you, which I'm sure he was, we'll take one more call.
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:49.421]  Let's go to Jason in Oregon.
[02:42:49.441 --> 02:42:50.561]  You're on the air with Colonel Roberts.
[02:42:50.581 --> 02:42:51.202]  Go ahead, Jason.
[02:42:51.702 --> 02:42:52.062]  Shalom.
[02:42:52.602 --> 02:42:52.822]  Hi.
[02:42:53.983 --> 02:42:54.723]  I was wondering if
[02:42:55.242 --> 02:42:57.184]  You gentlemen couldn't listen to yourselves.
[02:42:57.664 --> 02:43:10.653]  To use your own words, Alex, you're saying that they're making it to where you have no choice, and also that you've stated that they have unlimited funding, unlimited access, and pretty much already control the entire world.
[02:43:11.234 --> 02:43:14.496]  Wouldn't it be prudent at this time to return to the Scriptures?
[02:43:15.597 --> 02:43:20.080]  These have all been marked thousands of years ago by prophets, and these are the end times.
[02:43:20.701 --> 02:43:24.564]  And now would be the time that I would think, for the message, and the message is,
[02:43:25.149 --> 02:43:27.450]  Repent, for the reign of Yahuwah draws near.
[02:43:27.710 --> 02:43:31.352]  Yeah, but should we have a news and information radio show?
[02:43:31.372 --> 02:43:35.815]  I mean, or should just all be preachers with all different views arguing with each other?
[02:43:36.315 --> 02:43:40.077]  Well, for all that you've reported, how have you stopped their agenda?
[02:43:40.897 --> 02:43:43.179]  Oh, we've stopped their agenda a thousand times.
[02:43:43.499 --> 02:43:44.659]  They've got big problems.
[02:43:44.699 --> 02:43:48.761]  We're telling people how serious it is if they don't get more involved.
[02:43:48.802 --> 02:43:49.482]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:49.522 --> 02:43:51.883]  Look, I'm going to say this and I'll let Craig respond to it.
[02:43:52.483 --> 02:43:53.324]  I'm not a preacher.
[02:43:54.002 --> 02:43:55.945]  Now, I am a Christian, and I believe in God.
[02:43:55.965 --> 02:43:57.867]  And I wouldn't be alive right now if it wasn't for God.
[02:43:58.208 --> 02:44:00.410]  And going back through my whole life, things I've experienced.
[02:44:01.011 --> 02:44:03.715]  And I'll die the day God wants me to die.
[02:44:04.075 --> 02:44:06.158]  And I'm not afraid of the devil or all his minions.
[02:44:06.218 --> 02:44:06.999]  I'm afraid of God.
[02:44:07.019 --> 02:44:09.362]  And let me tell you folks, I am afraid of God.
[02:44:09.822 --> 02:44:17.812]  You realize the power of God, that God is real, this awesome, all-encompassing, omnipresent entity, then nothing else matters.
[02:44:18.253 --> 02:44:23.680]  I do what I believe God wants me to do, and I believe God's Spirit is with me, and I am humbled by that.
[02:44:24.100 --> 02:44:25.462]  I can feel the Spirit, folks.
[02:44:25.562 --> 02:44:27.344]  I don't want to get off into all this.
[02:44:27.845 --> 02:44:28.546]  Bottom line,
[02:44:29.474 --> 02:44:39.119]  These fake preachers tell you the end is near, George Bush is a Christian, the Antichrist is coming, just go along with it, you can't change things, you can't fight things.
[02:44:39.519 --> 02:44:45.102]  All the prophets ever did was say repent, and whole civilizations would be given 100 year reprieves, 50 year reprieves.
[02:44:45.602 --> 02:44:49.584]  Even if we're all going to die and the Antichrist is going to eat us like on shish kebabs,
[02:44:50.365 --> 02:44:53.388]  I have a job to warn people not to take the chip.
[02:44:53.788 --> 02:44:55.890]  I have a job to say, don't take the thumbskill.
[02:44:56.170 --> 02:45:01.315]  It's like if I'm out here on a hill and the enemy's charging me, I'm not going to go, look at the size of the enemy, I better give up.
[02:45:01.615 --> 02:45:04.297]  If I give up, I'm going to lose the initiative and I'm going to lose.
[02:45:04.578 --> 02:45:06.960]  So much of winning a fight is believing you're going to win the fight.
[02:45:07.360 --> 02:45:10.643]  You know, at the end of the world, Christ might come back in 500 years.
[02:45:11.023 --> 02:45:12.245]  It doesn't have to happen now.
[02:45:12.545 --> 02:45:17.089]  And regardless whether it's happening next week or 10 years from now, I've got a job to fight evil.
[02:45:18.110 --> 02:45:28.256]  And I come at this from a secular news reporting standpoint, where you can't deny all this is happening, and then more people have found the war than, you know, many other places, because I don't push it on them.
[02:45:29.017 --> 02:45:32.099]  I put the info out, and people go, my gosh, I've heard of this before.
[02:45:32.379 --> 02:45:32.719]  Colonel?
[02:45:33.320 --> 02:45:34.280]  Absolutely, Alex.
[02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:38.883]  You know, the thing about it is, God doesn't want us to stand around and get beaten up like stepchildren.
[02:45:38.923 --> 02:45:41.305]  He wants us to resist evil, period.
[02:45:41.872 --> 02:45:43.453]  Fight Satan wherever you find him.
[02:45:43.533 --> 02:45:46.193]  And you can't do it from a pulpit all the time.
[02:45:46.293 --> 02:45:48.054]  Somebody's got to be the centurion out there.
[02:45:48.094 --> 02:45:49.974]  Somebody's got to be the guy on the wall with the sword.
[02:45:50.575 --> 02:45:52.475]  And somebody's got to have the loudspeaker.
[02:45:52.495 --> 02:45:55.776]  And, you know, everybody in the village has a job to do.
[02:45:56.156 --> 02:45:59.317]  And we can't just say, okay, we're just going to roll over and repent and everything's going to be good.
[02:45:59.357 --> 02:46:03.579]  Because if you're going to do that, you might as well give people a Reader's Digest version of the Bible or the Cliff Notes.
[02:46:04.239 --> 02:46:06.880]  And so, basically, we know we're up against evil.
[02:46:07.380 --> 02:46:08.340]  What are we going to do about it?
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:09.580]  What can we do as an individual?
[02:46:09.660 --> 02:46:11.361]  What can we do as a family, as a team?
[02:46:11.801 --> 02:46:13.002]  As an organization.
[02:46:13.122 --> 02:46:15.904]  And all of these things is organizing against the devil.
[02:46:15.924 --> 02:46:16.465]  That's all it is.
[02:46:16.525 --> 02:46:18.266]  And you can't be crude if you don't get the word out.
[02:46:18.406 --> 02:46:20.368]  I think so many people haven't actually read the Bible.
[02:46:20.728 --> 02:46:25.111]  The whole story is that we're supposed to be here through this, fighting it.
[02:46:25.692 --> 02:46:27.153]  They say you're going to be beamed out of here.
[02:46:27.193 --> 02:46:29.515]  Well, why are they grabbing Christians and cutting their heads off?
[02:46:30.275 --> 02:46:31.776]  Our job is to fight it.
[02:46:31.817 --> 02:46:33.518]  And if it runs over us, so be it.
[02:46:33.758 --> 02:46:35.199]  But they're going to lose in the end.
[02:46:35.960 --> 02:46:36.420]  Absolutely.
[02:46:36.460 --> 02:46:38.882]  And these people who are hanging their hat on the Rapture Theory,
[02:46:39.598 --> 02:46:41.419]  You know, that's a very weak insurance policy.
[02:46:41.459 --> 02:46:43.000]  It's not backed up by very much at all.
[02:46:43.040 --> 02:46:54.386]  And if we had a rapture that was going to take all the Christians out of here, my question for those people is, why bother to have the Book of Revelation that goes all the way to the end if we don't need it because we're not going to be here?
[02:46:55.406 --> 02:46:59.428]  You know, it's just... Well, what are all these Christians that the devil's killing?
[02:46:59.688 --> 02:47:01.209]  How does he overcome the saints?
[02:47:01.929 --> 02:47:05.131]  If the saints are all... I mean, you can't argue with these people, though.
[02:47:05.431 --> 02:47:05.811]  Oh, I know.
[02:47:05.931 --> 02:47:08.733]  And it doesn't do any good to try.
[02:47:09.432 --> 02:47:11.573]  But the bottom line is, we have to resist.
[02:47:12.034 --> 02:47:13.674]  I'm going to tell you, Colonel, I'm going to fight 110%.
[02:47:14.455 --> 02:47:15.536]  I'm ready to be overcome.
[02:47:16.016 --> 02:47:17.397]  I'm ready to have my head cut off.
[02:47:17.437 --> 02:47:17.957]  Let's do it.
[02:47:18.637 --> 02:47:20.238]  I'm going to fight these people, period.
[02:47:20.318 --> 02:47:21.399]  I'm not going along with them.
[02:47:21.539 --> 02:47:24.541]  They're a bunch of degenerate, literal buckets of pus.
[02:47:26.041 --> 02:47:27.402]  You have such a way with words, Alex.
[02:47:28.283 --> 02:47:28.883]  I love you, buddy.
[02:47:29.724 --> 02:47:30.124]  Well, they are.
[02:47:30.164 --> 02:47:31.184]  I mean, they're buckets of pus.
[02:47:31.825 --> 02:47:34.947]  I mean, what did George Washington say?
[02:47:34.987 --> 02:47:35.727]  Duty is mine.
[02:47:35.787 --> 02:47:36.968]  Consequences belong to God.
[02:47:41.354 --> 02:47:42.975]  It's back to the same old thing.
[02:47:43.115 --> 02:47:44.255]  You have to get the word out.
[02:47:44.415 --> 02:47:45.455]  You have to keep putting it out.
[02:47:45.595 --> 02:47:47.856]  And every day, somebody new hears it and comes on board.
[02:47:49.536 --> 02:47:50.416]  Well, I mean, it's simple.
[02:47:50.436 --> 02:47:58.118]  Doesn't it give you a feeling of peace, though, to know that life is short, and you're doing the right thing, and you've not been a coward, Colonel, and that you're standing up against this?
[02:47:58.438 --> 02:47:59.159]  Well, you have to.
[02:47:59.719 --> 02:48:02.299]  I don't understand how anybody can be otherwise.
[02:48:02.379 --> 02:48:08.961]  I mean, there are people out there who do terrible, evil things, and they know it, but they think, well, I've got my paycheck coming in the mail.
[02:48:09.854 --> 02:48:11.235]  I've got my pension to think about.
[02:48:11.296 --> 02:48:12.637]  I've got orders from headquarters.
[02:48:13.137 --> 02:48:16.800]  And they try to justify in their minds why they're doing a lot of these things.
[02:48:17.561 --> 02:48:18.721]  And I can't do that.
[02:48:19.482 --> 02:48:23.225]  There are people in this world who cannot go out there and do evil things and then justify it.
[02:48:23.305 --> 02:48:24.506]  But there are people who can.
[02:48:24.886 --> 02:48:27.008]  And they're working for the devil.
[02:48:27.188 --> 02:48:27.469]  All right.
[02:48:27.549 --> 02:48:28.690]  RifleWarrior.com.
[02:48:28.710 --> 02:48:30.571]  A lot of great books and other materials.
[02:48:30.671 --> 02:48:32.753]  And Colonel, I hope to see you soon here in Austin.
[02:48:32.933 --> 02:48:33.333]  Will do it.
[02:48:33.814 --> 02:48:34.594]  Take care, my friend.
[02:48:35.595 --> 02:48:35.915]  All right.
[02:48:35.935 --> 02:48:38.978]  We'll come back, Dr. Ron and Jamie, and hit a few final news items.
[02:48:40.186 --> 02:48:40.426]  Hey!
[02:48:40.707 --> 02:48:42.408]  I mean, put up or shut up, folks!
[02:48:46.072 --> 02:48:48.974]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.175 --> 02:48:50.756]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:48:56.121 --> 02:49:00.565]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:00.966 --> 02:49:05.150]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:05.370 --> 02:49:08.191]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.291 --> 02:49:12.954]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.174 --> 02:49:17.556]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[02:51:15.504 --> 02:51:19.345]  On the internet, it is SacroWedgie.com.
[02:51:19.745 --> 02:51:24.706]  S-A-C-R-O W-E-D-G-Y dot com.
[02:51:24.906 --> 02:51:26.466]  SacroWedgie.com.
[02:51:26.906 --> 02:51:28.326]  Or you can use the toll-free number.
[02:51:28.346 --> 02:51:28.406]  1-800-737-
[02:51:32.427 --> 02:51:36.248]  9295.
[02:51:34.008 --> 02:51:36.248]  That's 737-9295.
[02:51:38.329 --> 02:51:38.649]  Call them.
[02:51:38.669 --> 02:51:38.989]  It's only $29.95.
[02:51:39.169 --> 02:51:41.850]  And it really works.
[02:51:44.930 --> 02:51:51.012]  I mean, if you want me to preach, I can do it.
[02:51:51.472 --> 02:51:54.953]  Those that are willing to give up their lives, save their lives.
[02:51:54.973 --> 02:51:57.053]  Those that try to covet them and keep them, lose them.
[02:51:57.673 --> 02:51:59.034]  That isn't even so much spiritual.
[02:51:59.094 --> 02:51:59.874]  It's just a law.
[02:52:00.472 --> 02:52:03.173]  If you're willing to stand up and fight for freedom, you're a lot safer.
[02:52:03.714 --> 02:52:08.616]  You want to grovel and be mealy-mouthed, make excuses and lie to yourself about what's going on?
[02:52:08.636 --> 02:52:09.697]  They're going to feed you poison.
[02:52:09.717 --> 02:52:11.358]  They're going to put it in your water.
[02:52:11.718 --> 02:52:12.659]  You're going to be scum.
[02:52:12.679 --> 02:52:13.939]  Your family's going to fall apart.
[02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:15.200]  You're not going to be happy.
[02:52:15.680 --> 02:52:17.621]  I mean, look at Americans.
[02:52:17.641 --> 02:52:23.024]  We're turning into just unhappy, unhealthy, twisted, demonic creatures.
[02:52:24.065 --> 02:52:26.486]  I mean, just look at the fruits of the New World Order.
[02:52:28.894 --> 02:52:29.934]  They're evil, folks.
[02:52:30.055 --> 02:52:31.275]  I don't like evil people.
[02:52:31.355 --> 02:52:33.576]  I don't like controlling bad guys.
[02:52:33.616 --> 02:52:35.457]  I hate con artists and scammers.
[02:52:36.317 --> 02:52:37.918]  I'm tired of them getting away with it.
[02:52:38.318 --> 02:52:39.659]  I'm tired of them conning you.
[02:52:39.759 --> 02:52:40.779]  I want to stop them.
[02:52:41.480 --> 02:52:42.420]  I want to defeat them.
[02:52:43.721 --> 02:52:44.961]  We've had a lot of victories.
[02:52:45.541 --> 02:52:47.302]  And it's the attitude of so many good people.
[02:52:47.342 --> 02:52:48.463]  Well, we can't do nothing.
[02:52:48.723 --> 02:52:50.023]  That's why we fail.
[02:52:50.584 --> 02:52:51.684]  Because you stayed home.
[02:52:52.184 --> 02:52:53.445]  You never got off the bench.
[02:52:53.465 --> 02:52:54.765]  You never got out of the dugout.
[02:52:55.126 --> 02:52:55.886]  Shame on you!
[02:52:57.952 --> 02:53:01.274]  Do you understand, folks, it's coming down to a time where you're not going to have a choice?
[02:53:02.094 --> 02:53:03.635]  You're going to WISH you'd have done something.
[02:53:04.035 --> 02:53:04.815]  Ron in New York.
[02:53:04.835 --> 02:53:05.756]  Go ahead, Ron, quickly.
[02:53:07.016 --> 02:53:07.576]  Yes, Alex.
[02:53:07.636 --> 02:53:20.002]  Calling from New York, where today we had an incident on a double-decker bus, where, based upon nothing more than a suspicion and a fact that a few people had backpacks, which is as common as rain, especially for the tourists that come to this international city,
[02:53:21.059 --> 02:53:35.007]  Uh, we had police, a large number of them, surround that bus with rifles, take everybody off the bus, search them, lay them down, handcuff the people that were suspected by the driver of the bus, have their bags searched, and it turned out to be nothing.
[02:53:35.627 --> 02:53:41.811]  It is disgusting when we have reached a point where we have our local government, well, the local government... Hey, let me joke with you, Ron.
[02:53:41.851 --> 02:53:43.972]  Were they a bunch of six-foot-two Swedes?
[02:53:44.935 --> 02:53:45.956]  Well, I couldn't tell.
[02:53:45.976 --> 02:53:48.679]  The report just showed you everybody that was on the bus.
[02:53:48.719 --> 02:53:51.703]  No, and listen, have you seen my film The Takeover?
[02:53:51.983 --> 02:53:56.768]  They were doing drills live, though with real buses, where the Army was doing that back in 1998 in Texas.
[02:53:58.925 --> 02:54:08.051]  Well, what really gets to me on this is we've now got a state of paranoia that, in fact, has been whipped up by the local government and even... No, it's like War of the Worlds!
[02:54:08.331 --> 02:54:09.072]  Yeah, exactly!
[02:54:09.092 --> 02:54:10.433]  It's country paranoia.
[02:54:10.953 --> 02:54:13.114]  We're turning in on our own citizens.
[02:54:13.535 --> 02:54:20.239]  We're based on nothing more than, oh, I have a suspicion because I just got this little feeling in the back of my head that there's something wrong with you.
[02:54:20.779 --> 02:54:23.841]  We send out, you know, the troops, figuratively speaking.
[02:54:23.901 --> 02:54:26.203]  Well, Ron, maybe we should just wait for the rapture.
[02:54:26.852 --> 02:54:27.672]  No, they're not going to.
[02:54:27.752 --> 02:54:31.373]  Listen, Alex, that whole rapture thing, people have to understand something about that.
[02:54:31.634 --> 02:54:32.994]  Alright, and I'll address that real quick.
[02:54:33.014 --> 02:54:34.194]  I was being sarcastic, Ron.
[02:54:35.155 --> 02:54:48.719]  If God did not save his own son from the ordeal and the trial of crucifixion to see if he would be found wanting, then why would he rapture John Q. public
[02:54:49.398 --> 02:54:51.720]  In times of judgment and severity.
[02:54:52.180 --> 02:54:53.201]  That doesn't make sense.
[02:54:53.701 --> 02:54:59.525]  And yes, we do have to oppose this, because if I understand the Gospels, it also says that the saints will be killed in that time.
[02:54:59.585 --> 02:55:01.586]  Thus, you could assume the saints will be resisting.
[02:55:02.507 --> 02:55:03.868]  Why else would they be put to death?
[02:55:04.808 --> 02:55:07.750]  So, for people that think that, I think you'd better read that.
[02:55:08.110 --> 02:55:08.491]  I know.
[02:55:08.511 --> 02:55:09.611]  We're out of time, Ron.
[02:55:09.651 --> 02:55:10.352]  Gotta let you go.
[02:55:10.432 --> 02:55:11.413]  I know it's horrible.
[02:55:11.433 --> 02:55:12.033]  We're being trained.
[02:55:12.053 --> 02:55:13.174]  That'll be slaves right now.
[02:55:13.534 --> 02:55:14.375]  Jamie in Kentucky.
[02:55:14.415 --> 02:55:15.075]  Quickly, Jamie.
[02:55:15.795 --> 02:55:16.156]  Uh, yeah.
[02:55:17.524 --> 02:55:25.390]  I heard on the radio a couple nights ago that they're trying to make it in Congress to take away our gun laws.
[02:55:26.911 --> 02:55:29.574]  You mean that you're... Ban the guns, yeah.
[02:55:29.774 --> 02:55:30.795]  You heard about a repeal?
[02:55:31.055 --> 02:55:31.535]  This week.
[02:55:33.077 --> 02:55:35.559]  Oh, you're talking about so you can't sue gun manufacturers?
[02:55:35.839 --> 02:55:37.500]  Yeah.
[02:55:37.640 --> 02:55:39.322]  It's coming close to that, what I mean.
[02:55:40.131 --> 02:55:41.832]  Now, well, that movement's good.
[02:55:41.872 --> 02:55:44.453]  There's also a bad one to put us in databases.
[02:55:44.553 --> 02:55:45.754]  So, again, we're fighting.
[02:55:45.774 --> 02:55:46.514]  We're having some bickering.
[02:55:46.534 --> 02:55:46.994]  Thanks, Jamie.
[02:55:47.615 --> 02:55:48.955]  Out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:48.995 --> 02:55:50.156]  A lot of news we didn't get to.
[02:55:50.176 --> 02:55:51.657]  It was still a smoking broadcast.
[02:55:51.677 --> 02:55:53.157]  A lot of info did get out.
[02:55:54.058 --> 02:55:58.220]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and get my new video, Martial Law.
[02:55:58.240 --> 02:56:02.382]  Start making copies of it so we can have an awakening of who stands to gain from terror.
[02:56:03.735 --> 02:56:05.476]  You gotta expose who's behind the terror.
[02:56:05.836 --> 02:56:08.096]  That brings the New World Order to a grinding halt.
[02:56:08.637 --> 02:56:13.018]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.tv to order via the safe secure shopping carts.
[02:56:13.518 --> 02:56:17.459]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:17.599 --> 02:56:20.500]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:20.800 --> 02:56:22.201]  Get out there and defend your family.
[02:56:22.241 --> 02:56:23.981]  God bless you all!
[02:56:24.802 --> 02:56:29.463]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-376-45.
[02:56:35.101 --> 02:56:35.618]  Hello, folks!
[02:56:35.638 --> 02:56:35.659]  I...
