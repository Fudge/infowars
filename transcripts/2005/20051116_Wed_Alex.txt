[00:00:05.763 --> 00:00:06.403]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.064 --> 00:00:08.144]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.845 --> 00:00:09.945]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:11.406]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:13.067]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:17.370]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.052]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.453 --> 00:00:24.094]  Music
[00:00:39.862 --> 00:00:40.842]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:40.882 --> 00:00:44.744]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:55.370]  As we blast out on the AM and FM dials, simulcast on Global Shortwave, and of course the internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:00:57.117 --> 00:01:02.360]  Coming up in the next hour, we have a lady coming on who lost a loved one in Vietnam.
[00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.764]  And our own government's documents and witnesses admit that he was alive until the 80s and that he died in a slave labor camp.
[00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:13.506]  And our government, John McCain, has been fighting to cover it up.
[00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.948]  But really, as horrible as that is, it's par for the course.
[00:01:17.068 --> 00:01:20.950]  Our government admittedly let the Russians have over 20,000 U.S.
[00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.491]  soldiers killed
[00:01:24.657 --> 00:01:24.957]  U.S.
[00:01:24.997 --> 00:01:37.562]  servicemen that were in German detention camps let them have them, and didn't even say a word, and they were used for medical experiments on the Kamchatka Peninsula and many other areas.
[00:01:38.002 --> 00:01:40.163]  That's your government.
[00:01:40.683 --> 00:01:43.084]  And that is declassified and publicly admitted.
[00:01:43.344 --> 00:01:50.847]  So next time you're loving the government and licking their boots and worshipping them, remember, they take... In World War II, they were already that evil.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.720]  20,000 plus.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.463]  It was around 24,000 troops total.
[00:01:57.044 --> 00:01:57.344]  U.S.
[00:01:57.384 --> 00:01:57.745]  troops.
[00:01:58.145 --> 00:01:59.547]  Several thousand British as well.
[00:02:00.373 --> 00:02:04.716]  And just sayonara, Stalin wants you, Stalin gets you.
[00:02:04.736 --> 00:02:05.417]  I mean, what do you expect?
[00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:15.604]  They'd already given much of Eastern Europe and other areas, Central Europe, to Stalin, Mr. Steele, so he could conduct extermination operations.
[00:02:15.644 --> 00:02:26.011]  After all, he was a globalist stoolie, a globalist minion, a globalist bank-robbing thug enforcer who helped bring their boy, Vladimir Lenin, to power.
[00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:31.281]  So it's the same thing over and over and over again.
[00:02:31.641 --> 00:02:33.942]  So just remember how much they hate you.
[00:02:35.403 --> 00:02:39.385]  It's like that story we covered that was in major Jewish newspapers a few months ago.
[00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:48.749]  Just take 110,000, I kept reporting 100,000, I'm sorry, it was actually over 110,000, and radiating them, many dying on the spot, many others dying years later.
[00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.172]  Just testing on little five-year-olds over a ten-year period in conjunction with our government paying for it.
[00:02:54.824 --> 00:02:57.585]  You think you're safe when we've got governments that will radiate little children?
[00:02:57.985 --> 00:03:02.546]  Everybody's freaking out over Israel saying, we'll shoot three-year-olds if they're in a security area.
[00:03:03.286 --> 00:03:04.507]  We'll shoot small children.
[00:03:04.547 --> 00:03:06.347]  We'll unload machine guns into them.
[00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.768]  Because they're not even human.
[00:03:09.788 --> 00:03:10.768]  They don't even have any rights.
[00:03:10.808 --> 00:03:11.909]  They're terrorists, supposedly.
[00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:14.429]  They'll do that to their own children, folks.
[00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:15.750]  Our own government will do that to us.
[00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.630]  The Germans did it to their children.
[00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.390]  The Russians do it.
[00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.511]  This is what governments do.
[00:03:22.128 --> 00:03:23.908]  And they're totally out of control.
[00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.090]  Oh, but Saddam Hussein is evil because we claim he had rape rooms.
[00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:36.572]  But then our government sets up rape rooms, and it's defended by all the same neocons that decried the hypothetical rape rooms before.
[00:03:36.592 --> 00:03:42.053]  Okay, there's a lot of news here, a lot of serious, weighty news today.
[00:03:43.213 --> 00:03:45.494]  In 30 minutes I have a gentleman joining us.
[00:03:46.565 --> 00:03:54.268]  Who came on briefly yesterday, and he's got photos and videos now that we're going to be getting on the web here in the next few days.
[00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:59.270]  And I called the school, and they're not denying it.
[00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.251]  And they're not even returning phone calls, but we have talked to them.
[00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:05.512]  They go, well, there are some troops here, but they're just helping.
[00:04:05.972 --> 00:04:08.393]  And the troops are there to make sure the kids behave themselves.
[00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:14.095]  Just troops at a middle school, Zachary Middle School down in San Antonio.
[00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:23.664]  And so our guest will be joining us just for about 10 minutes or so at the bottom of this hour and then the next hour, the poor lady, concerning her loved one.
[00:04:24.184 --> 00:04:26.685]  And our government just, you know, could care less about it.
[00:04:26.705 --> 00:04:33.306]  And she's dug up a lot on Senator McCain, who really wasn't in those slave camps most of the time.
[00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:36.527]  He was traveling around lavishly in Eastern Europe enjoying himself.
[00:04:37.268 --> 00:04:41.689]  Always been a good agent of the globalists via the Moscow route.
[00:04:42.947 --> 00:04:45.790]  So, a little expose of Lord McCain.
[00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.512]  I'm sure some of you will become very angry about that.
[00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:51.375]  That's coming up today as well.
[00:04:51.475 --> 00:04:56.219]  Infowars.com, Infowars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.300]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.602]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.617 --> 00:05:03.077]  We're good to go.
[00:05:22.483 --> 00:05:22.823]  We're good to go.
[00:05:22.843 --> 00:05:23.463]  We're good to go.
[00:05:49.571 --> 00:05:52.556]  Or watch the film right now online at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:06:01.932 --> 00:06:10.535]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:10.755 --> 00:06:22.018]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:22.238 --> 00:06:24.899]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:29.340]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:39.949]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.875]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:46.195 --> 00:06:50.119]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:51.560]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:03.357 --> 00:07:04.958]  Government is best with government leads.
[00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:06.820]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.942]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:07:10.423 --> 00:07:13.065]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:07:13.505 --> 00:07:19.990]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:07:42.425 --> 00:07:42.765]  Have you?
[00:07:43.365 --> 00:07:44.886]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:07:46.867 --> 00:07:48.428]  If only our president would listen to his gods.

[00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:06.164]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.544 --> 00:08:08.826]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:23.032 --> 00:08:31.476]  Coming up in about 20 minutes, we're going to be joined by Elijah Romo, and he's down in San Antonio.
[00:08:31.496 --> 00:08:32.997]  Of course, a father and family man.
[00:08:33.617 --> 00:08:38.160]  Went to the Zachary Middle School by...
[00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:46.441]  1604 and Calabria down in San Antonio, and there were troops in camouflage marching around.
[00:08:46.501 --> 00:08:53.884]  Today they're in Desert Storm style battle fatigues with their walkie-talkies reporting, walking children across the street.
[00:08:55.785 --> 00:08:58.326]  And he called in and told us about it yesterday.
[00:08:58.346 --> 00:09:02.748]  We've since called the school and confirmed that's going on, but they won't give us any comment on it.
[00:09:02.788 --> 00:09:04.669]  There's just troops there for some reason.
[00:09:05.943 --> 00:09:08.404]  And these schools are already being turned into prisons.
[00:09:08.704 --> 00:09:26.308]  And now they're going to have the new Freedom Initiative with forced psychological testing and forced psychological drugging with using the diagnosis off of guidelines written up by the drug companies themselves and their own memos are now public where they brag, hey, we'll go from 10% of the kids on our drugs to half of them.
[00:09:26.808 --> 00:09:28.329]  It's going to be big business.
[00:09:29.469 --> 00:09:32.630]  No discussion about helping them like you hear.
[00:09:33.858 --> 00:09:36.862]  And so these are literally mind control facilities.
[00:09:38.223 --> 00:09:39.545]  And how creepy is that?
[00:09:39.605 --> 00:09:41.227]  There's troops marching around.
[00:09:43.896 --> 00:09:49.861]  Mr. Romo talked to some people at the school before they clammed up, and they told him, they said, oh, they're here for security.
[00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.342]  We've had some rowdy kids.
[00:09:52.023 --> 00:10:02.792]  So the message is, it's not just enough to have cops on the schools and frisking everyone and ID cards and fences and locking doors and being sealed in like prisoners and being questioned.
[00:10:03.152 --> 00:10:04.233]  That's not enough now.
[00:10:04.734 --> 00:10:06.335]  Now the troops need to do it.
[00:10:07.276 --> 00:10:09.498]  And all over the country, from Missouri...
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.981]  To Texas, to Pensacola, Florida.
[00:10:15.122 --> 00:10:17.803]  We have had troops come in and do urban warfare drills.
[00:10:17.823 --> 00:10:24.826]  We've had troops come in and announce, in 1998, Pensacola, Florida, this is martial law, get down on the floor, we're taking over.
[00:10:26.007 --> 00:10:38.432]  Screaming at them with M-16s pointed at them, obviously unloaded, at least the press report said, but the kids were crying, and at the end they said, Bill Clinton wants you to know what martial law is like.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.903]  Now, that's a quote from the Pensacola News Journal.
[00:10:42.943 --> 00:10:44.385]  In fact, we copied the story.
[00:10:44.425 --> 00:10:46.747]  It's still on Infowars.com.
[00:10:48.429 --> 00:10:49.570]  And we've seen this all over.
[00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.193]  It's mass mind control, mass conditioning.
[00:10:54.795 --> 00:10:59.639]  And, of course, I reported on this three and a half years ago in my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:01.321]  It's one of the definitive works out there.
[00:11:02.444 --> 00:11:06.885]  That government documents, training manuals, FEMA actually giving the training as well.
[00:11:07.325 --> 00:11:10.946]  That all Christians are terrorists, gun owners are terrorists, homeschoolers are terrorists.
[00:11:11.706 --> 00:11:13.907]  And then lo and behold, it comes out in the AP.
[00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:16.227]  Remember early last year, almost two years ago now.
[00:11:17.547 --> 00:11:18.448]  People didn't want to believe me.
[00:11:18.468 --> 00:11:19.868]  They didn't want to believe those documents.
[00:11:19.928 --> 00:11:25.589]  I even got emails and claims that those were fake FEMA people and fake rooms full of police officers.
[00:11:25.869 --> 00:11:28.190]  You know, the cameras at the back of the room, there's a room full of cops.
[00:11:29.091 --> 00:11:31.392]  And I just hired all these fake people.
[00:11:31.452 --> 00:11:43.255]  It's like I've been accused in Urban Warrior of having the Coronado, a battle carrier ship, almost the size of an aircraft carrier, the next class down, and dozens of helicopters and hovercrafts and thousands of troops.
[00:11:43.615 --> 00:11:49.137]  I hired them all because people saw the role players saying, I'm an American, please know not the camp.
[00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:50.230]  We're good to go.
[00:11:50.250 --> 00:11:50.390]  I think?
[00:12:12.097 --> 00:12:14.339]  That I know how much that would cost.
[00:12:14.359 --> 00:12:16.821]  $50 million conservatively.
[00:12:17.081 --> 00:12:17.501]  But you know what?
[00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:19.763]  You don't have to believe me that I got all this footage.
[00:12:20.043 --> 00:12:27.048]  People would just go to the Marine Corps' own website, UrbanWarrior99, and just go look at photos that match the video I shot.
[00:12:27.068 --> 00:12:28.489]  Doesn't matter.
[00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:35.154]  Literally, I've probably gotten 100 emails, 20 calls on air, people on the street saying, That's fake, man.
[00:12:35.595 --> 00:12:35.995]  It's fake.
[00:12:37.088 --> 00:12:38.029]  Just like Pensacola.
[00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:39.229]  This is martial law.
[00:12:39.249 --> 00:12:43.452]  Bill Clinton wants you to know what martial law is like.
[00:12:43.993 --> 00:12:45.333]  Was it Hobbes Middle School?
[00:12:45.353 --> 00:12:46.414]  I still remember that.
[00:12:47.535 --> 00:12:48.575]  It's just not true.
[00:12:48.656 --> 00:12:50.437]  It's just not real.
[00:12:52.398 --> 00:12:57.881]  Well, down at this middle school, and I won't really answer our questions, just yes, there's some troops here helping.
[00:12:59.823 --> 00:13:02.785]  There is military stomping around.
[00:13:02.945 --> 00:13:04.766]  And look, I personally...
[00:13:05.552 --> 00:13:08.034]  I've gotten footage, and I've been sent footage by listeners in San Antonio.
[00:13:08.954 --> 00:13:20.621]  Before 9-11, you'd go down to Fiesta in downtown San Antonio, and there'd just be MPs from the Air Force, the big Air Force town, would just walk up to me and say, Well, why are you here?
[00:13:20.641 --> 00:13:21.702]  We're just here to help, sir.
[00:13:21.802 --> 00:13:22.403]  You get that?
[00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.772]  And they have Mardi Gras, and I have the newscast of this.
[00:13:27.832 --> 00:13:30.454]  I aired it a few months ago, put it on the weekly TV report.
[00:13:30.474 --> 00:13:33.215]  A lot of you have a chance to see it at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:13:33.755 --> 00:13:37.557]  But they have National Guard and regular army out in Galveston for the Mardi Gras.
[00:13:37.878 --> 00:13:44.801]  And it shows troops with batons marching and bugging their eyes out at revelers, and just stomping around and leading the parades.
[00:13:45.122 --> 00:13:46.522]  It's just acclimation.
[00:13:47.163 --> 00:13:49.904]  It's Red Dawn in slow motion.
[00:13:51.005 --> 00:13:51.085]  And...
[00:13:51.918 --> 00:14:03.664]  How many people, Ron Paul, the Congressman, Paul Craig Roberts, high-level Reagan official, number two at the Treasury, editor of the Wall Street Journal was saying this last week.
[00:14:03.684 --> 00:14:11.448]  I mean, there's countless prominent people that we've had on, if I went through all of them, it would take hours, who've been saying, yes, it's true, yes, it's happening.
[00:14:11.708 --> 00:14:14.190]  Tommy Frank says, yeah, one more attack, we go to martial law.
[00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:15.891]  We set aside the Constitution.
[00:14:16.171 --> 00:14:17.932]  Well, the Constitution is America.
[00:14:18.852 --> 00:14:20.173]  The Bill of Rights is America.
[00:14:21.994 --> 00:14:23.635]  So I'm sorry this is scary.
[00:14:23.675 --> 00:14:25.236]  I'm sorry this is out of control.
[00:14:25.456 --> 00:14:26.496]  But it's real.
[00:14:27.837 --> 00:14:28.817]  It's going on.
[00:14:29.157 --> 00:14:31.318]  We're in the real world now, boys and girls.
[00:14:31.358 --> 00:14:32.499]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:14:33.579 --> 00:14:34.320]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:46.045]  But we're going to have Elijah Romo on because he has a lot of courage and we appreciate him for getting involved and getting some video and taking some photos.
[00:14:46.065 --> 00:14:47.926]  He says he's going to get even more today.
[00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:53.444]  But when he went up to them and talked to them later, they said, yeah, you're not the first person here that's been complaining.
[00:14:54.464 --> 00:14:56.965]  See, I mean, this is body snatcher weird.
[00:14:57.565 --> 00:14:59.425]  This is Twilight Zone Outer Limits weird.
[00:14:59.445 --> 00:15:00.825]  You know, you show up, why are troops here?
[00:15:01.045 --> 00:15:02.606]  Don't, they're here to help.
[00:15:03.146 --> 00:15:04.366]  What's wrong with you?
[00:15:04.386 --> 00:15:06.286]  The troops are here now.
[00:15:07.767 --> 00:15:09.947]  Just, again, it's like Russia.
[00:15:11.927 --> 00:15:13.428]  And it's all incremental.
[00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:14.928]  It's incrementally happening.
[00:15:16.056 --> 00:15:25.000]  They had Marines dressed up in police uniforms 17 years ago that we have confirmed from the documents, from the photos, from the individuals that did it.
[00:15:25.281 --> 00:15:26.081]  And how do we know this?
[00:15:27.282 --> 00:15:30.543]  The fella then became a police officer, then became a computer company owner.
[00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:32.144]  He's middle class.
[00:15:32.184 --> 00:15:32.964]  He's driving up I-35.
[00:15:33.004 --> 00:15:35.305]  This is even before 9-11.
[00:15:36.166 --> 00:15:38.227]  And there's just suddenly troops out.
[00:15:39.062 --> 00:15:46.367]  Army trips out helping the police run a random checkpoint, and he gets pulled over by them, and they start questioning him, and he just blows up.
[00:15:46.407 --> 00:15:47.227]  He gets mad.
[00:15:47.908 --> 00:15:52.171]  He's out jogging in his middle-class neighborhood, and the cop pulls up and asks him what he's doing.
[00:15:52.191 --> 00:15:59.556]  You know, he's a former Marine officer, a former cop, computer company owner, very successful.
[00:16:00.316 --> 00:16:01.157]  He's just sick of it.
[00:16:01.177 --> 00:16:03.138]  He showed me photos, documents, all of it.
[00:16:03.398 --> 00:16:06.040]  We put it in Road to Tyranny.
[00:16:06.781 --> 00:16:09.642]  Couldn't put a lot of the documents in, or you'd know exactly who he was.
[00:16:10.182 --> 00:16:11.562]  But he just said, look, I'm sick of it.
[00:16:12.182 --> 00:16:13.403]  I'm not putting up with it anymore.
[00:16:13.463 --> 00:16:14.523]  This is out of control.
[00:16:16.364 --> 00:16:18.004]  He's being pulled over by troops.
[00:16:18.024 --> 00:16:18.684]  Do you understand?
[00:16:18.704 --> 00:16:20.045]  Troops!
[00:16:20.785 --> 00:16:21.285]  Troops!
[00:16:22.605 --> 00:16:25.986]  And back in the late 80s, and I've interviewed others, by the way.
[00:16:26.646 --> 00:16:29.187]  Virginia was the big hot spot for this then, a big testing ground.
[00:16:29.507 --> 00:16:34.268]  They would go kick down gun dealers' homes and BATF raids with U.S.
[00:16:34.308 --> 00:16:35.909]  Marines dressed up like police.
[00:16:37.938 --> 00:16:39.941]  Wearing jackets that said police.
[00:16:40.402 --> 00:16:41.884]  This is going on everywhere.
[00:16:43.126 --> 00:16:47.633]  It's like the former SWAT team commander, Lieutenant Beck, here in Austin, laughed at me about Delta Force.
[00:16:47.693 --> 00:16:48.795]  I said, look, they'll be coming to town.
[00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:51.259]  They'll ask you to covert operations with them.
[00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:55.623]  And he's like, I was a Marine Corps sniper in Vietnam.
[00:16:55.823 --> 00:16:57.064]  We're not about to put up with that.
[00:16:57.104 --> 00:16:58.326]  That's illegal, Alex.
[00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:00.027]  That shit is ridiculous.
[00:17:00.547 --> 00:17:02.729]  About six months later, hey, you want to come up to my office?
[00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:03.770]  Look here, here's this card.
[00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.491]  I can't let you have it.
[00:17:04.651 --> 00:17:05.892]  But everything you said is true.
[00:17:06.152 --> 00:17:06.813]  I said no.
[00:17:07.173 --> 00:17:08.474]  He was fired a few months later.
[00:17:09.475 --> 00:17:15.941]  Now they got some boys that are willing to wear the black uniform and swagger about.
[00:17:17.342 --> 00:17:19.804]  And we're willing to put a knife to the soft flesh.
[00:17:21.778 --> 00:17:26.561]  Road across the arteries, as long as we get to wear fancy uniforms.
[00:17:27.921 --> 00:17:29.062]  I'm not saying they're all bad.
[00:17:29.122 --> 00:17:32.484]  I have knowledge that they've now been doing that stuff.
[00:17:33.104 --> 00:17:36.106]  But I guess it's, well, we just got to do it or we lose our job.
[00:17:36.126 --> 00:17:40.148]  Besides terrorism, hell, 9-11 happened.
[00:17:40.488 --> 00:17:42.449]  Things got to change now, man.
[00:17:44.610 --> 00:17:49.393]  So this is the reality, and we'll be talking to Elijah Romo coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:17:50.709 --> 00:17:51.771]  And then there's this article.
[00:17:52.972 --> 00:17:54.815]  This is out of the Statesman yesterday.
[00:17:55.456 --> 00:17:58.540]  Park Police Bust Unlicensed Student Boxing Matches.
[00:17:59.281 --> 00:18:02.745]  Meanwhile, Mexican troops are engaging in car bombings here in Texas.
[00:18:03.106 --> 00:18:03.847]  It's not the news.
[00:18:04.007 --> 00:18:05.229]  It's not really allowed to be in the news.
[00:18:06.124 --> 00:18:08.527]  Somebody forgot the first rule of Fight Club.
[00:18:08.567 --> 00:18:09.908]  Do not talk about Fight Club.
[00:18:10.349 --> 00:18:11.490]  Do not promote Fight Club.
[00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:14.553]  Do not build a website with scheduled bouts and videos of Fight Club.
[00:18:15.154 --> 00:18:18.117]  And do not, do not let Austin Park Police find out about Fight Club.
[00:18:18.498 --> 00:18:20.900]  Well, it isn't Fight Club without bare knuckles.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.865]  It's big, 16-ounce gloves that will exhaust you just throwing them.
[00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:36.169]  I mean, even back when I was a kid, which wasn't that long ago, there was always some kid in the neighborhood whose dad had a boxing ring in the backyard, and we'd go put gloves on and bash each other in the face with it.
[00:18:36.189 --> 00:18:39.029]  Can you imagine neighbors calling the police?
[00:18:39.570 --> 00:18:44.511]  And I went and watched some of these videos online, spent on the news, very tame stuff.
[00:18:45.311 --> 00:18:49.033]  I mean, you've got skinny frat boys in Westlake in a park.
[00:18:49.213 --> 00:18:50.173]  We hadn't been hiding it.
[00:18:50.768 --> 00:18:52.049]  Because it wasn't Fight Club.
[00:18:52.069 --> 00:18:57.232]  They were trying to act like it was some dirty, bad, wild, ultimate fighting.
[00:18:57.613 --> 00:19:00.495]  No, it was just kids getting together and having some sporting fun.
[00:19:00.715 --> 00:19:02.676]  Hey, you're supposed to be watching your Xbox and TV.
[00:19:02.716 --> 00:19:04.858]  You're supposed to be snorting cocaine.
[00:19:05.098 --> 00:19:06.479]  You're not supposed to be boxing.
[00:19:07.699 --> 00:19:10.702]  My dad used to go over to his friend's house and they'd box.
[00:19:11.162 --> 00:19:12.283]  People in the golden gloves.
[00:19:12.323 --> 00:19:15.645]  I mean, it's just kids with boxing gloves.
[00:19:16.309 --> 00:19:28.012]  But now the state's saying, we may shut down the dojos, we may not allow any more sparring, we're not going to let anybody do anything unless there's a doctor present, and unless there's going to be some heavy taxes to pay.
[00:19:28.272 --> 00:19:29.492]  You've got to have a license.
[00:19:31.493 --> 00:19:34.974]  And they've arrested them, and they're charging them, and they're doing it all.
[00:19:35.034 --> 00:19:35.774]  And you know what?
[00:19:36.694 --> 00:19:38.395]  Almost every school in the U.S.
[00:19:38.435 --> 00:19:39.615]  has banned dodgeball.
[00:19:39.655 --> 00:19:41.676]  Little soft rubber balls, we would beg to play it.
[00:19:42.036 --> 00:19:42.976]  They've banned tag.
[00:19:44.082 --> 00:19:45.483]  And yes, I have reports.
[00:19:45.643 --> 00:19:49.204]  Children sneak off behind the school and play it when they're not allowed to.
[00:19:49.584 --> 00:19:53.346]  They're being arrested by the police, by the prison police.
[00:19:54.246 --> 00:19:56.007]  You're not even allowed to get energetic now.
[00:19:56.027 --> 00:19:57.307]  You're not allowed to let your blood flow.
[00:19:57.347 --> 00:19:59.288]  Just take your Prozac scum!
[00:20:03.129 --> 00:20:09.732]  Do you desire to increase your energy levels and relieve your pain and stress without chemicals, drugs, or expensive supplements?
[00:20:10.416 --> 00:20:18.803]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, release pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[00:20:19.464 --> 00:20:26.430]  You have the opportunity to wear vitamins, minerals, and nutrients that absorb through your skin rather than taking them orally.
[00:20:27.088 --> 00:20:28.069]  We're good to go.
[00:20:48.468 --> 00:20:57.030]  This is Brian David Anderson, researcher and inventor of the TriVortex technology products, wishing you and yours a joyous holiday season.
[00:21:03.011 --> 00:21:04.072]  The war on terrorism.
[00:21:04.372 --> 00:21:07.152]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:07.433 --> 00:21:11.573]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:12.014 --> 00:21:12.834]  So what do you do?
[00:21:13.154 --> 00:21:17.735]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:18.215 --> 00:21:20.336]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:20.816 --> 00:21:35.519]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:42.621]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:42.981 --> 00:21:47.385]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:21:47.825 --> 00:21:49.607]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:49.627 --> 00:21:49.847]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:21:49.927 --> 00:21:51.368]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:01.221 --> 00:22:07.447]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:07.887 --> 00:22:15.674]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:16.015 --> 00:22:23.862]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:24.182 --> 00:22:25.043]  Thanks for having me.
[00:22:44.215 --> 00:22:44.755]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[00:23:01.616 --> 00:23:05.279]  Natto kinase is a powerful enzyme that supports healthy blood flow.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:13.306]  The enzyme is isolated from a traditional Japanese food called natto, which has been eaten in Japan for over 2,000 years for cardiovascular health.
[00:23:13.666 --> 00:23:18.771]  Dr. Martin Milner, M.D., professor of cardiovascular and pulmonary medicine, says...
[00:23:19.111 --> 00:23:28.339]  In all my years of research as a professor of cardiovascular and pulmonary medicine, natokinase represents the most exciting new development in supporting cardiovascular health.
[00:23:28.539 --> 00:23:34.223]  Dr. Jonathan Wright, MD, says the first patient we asked to try it had a rapid and dramatic response.
[00:23:34.604 --> 00:23:38.427]  Allergy Research Group uses only the gold standard natokinase.
[00:23:38.707 --> 00:23:47.217]  Which is the only form endorsed by Dr. Sumi, the discoverer of natokinase, and Dr. Ralph Halsworth, the leading natokinase researcher in the U.S.
[00:23:47.477 --> 00:23:55.747]  Natokinase can be found by visiting AllergyResearchGroup.com or NutriMedical.com or by calling 1-800-545-9960.
[00:24:07.642 --> 00:24:22.413]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest A gun on my hip and the right to arrest I'm the guy who's a boss on the highway Let me just finish up my comments on the situation with the evil high schoolers boxing, having a boxing club
[00:24:28.586 --> 00:24:31.008]  Out in a public park in front of everyone.
[00:24:31.028 --> 00:24:32.309]  They weren't hiding it.
[00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:36.231]  It isn't like Tyler Durgin in the Fight Club.
[00:24:37.772 --> 00:24:41.574]  This was just simply people out having some fun.
[00:24:43.235 --> 00:24:49.639]  And the police, depending on what report you read, sent in between 20 and 15 officers.
[00:24:49.679 --> 00:24:50.379]  They hid out.
[00:24:50.439 --> 00:24:51.320]  They staked out.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.341]  They took photos.
[00:24:52.901 --> 00:24:56.123]  They rushed out of the woods, heavily armed, aiming guns at people.
[00:24:57.012 --> 00:25:03.076]  And the police say, well, we just had our hands on our guns, and there were only 10 or 15 of us, not 20-something.
[00:25:03.657 --> 00:25:05.318]  Regardless, it's insane.
[00:25:05.918 --> 00:25:10.021]  It just shows how they cringe and cower in fear of everything.
[00:25:12.602 --> 00:25:21.028]  Folks, all over the nation, dodgeball is banned in most school districts.
[00:25:21.088 --> 00:25:22.389]  We would beg to play it.
[00:25:23.012 --> 00:25:24.513]  The girls would beg to play it.
[00:25:24.553 --> 00:25:26.354]  The nerds would beg to play it.
[00:25:26.774 --> 00:25:27.635]  It was fun.
[00:25:27.655 --> 00:25:32.078]  You sit there and throw these soft rubber balls at each other and try to dodge them.
[00:25:32.178 --> 00:25:33.118]  No one disliked it.
[00:25:33.358 --> 00:25:36.720]  But no, it's hateful and mean and some kids don't like it, so we're banning it.
[00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:39.802]  And now don't play tag either.
[00:25:39.842 --> 00:25:40.823]  It's aggressive.
[00:25:43.445 --> 00:25:47.867]  But go play video games where you simulate millions of murders every year.
[00:25:48.928 --> 00:25:49.769]  Go do that.
[00:25:49.869 --> 00:25:51.950]  Again, just craziness.
[00:25:54.466 --> 00:26:05.449]  And there have been reports all over the country of where during lunch the middle schoolers will run out behind the baseball fields or wherever and pull out of their own backpack their own dodgeball.
[00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:06.750]  Come on, let's do it.
[00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.790]  Let's play it up.
[00:26:08.330 --> 00:26:13.912]  They turn around and drawn down on them is the local school cop with his taser.
[00:26:13.932 --> 00:26:14.632]  Get on the ground.
[00:26:14.652 --> 00:26:15.513]  That's assault.
[00:26:16.313 --> 00:26:17.753]  You're not allowed to play that.
[00:26:17.773 --> 00:26:19.294]  I'm charging you.
[00:26:19.394 --> 00:26:19.854]  Literally.
[00:26:20.896 --> 00:26:21.716]  And it's in the news.
[00:26:21.916 --> 00:26:24.317]  It was a vicious assault with a rubber ball.
[00:26:24.657 --> 00:26:27.237]  They were back there and they were doing it.
[00:26:27.877 --> 00:26:29.178]  They were doing it.
[00:26:30.278 --> 00:26:38.139]  Meanwhile, rocket attacks, machine gun attacks, hundreds dead, car bombings, and it's not in the newspaper because it's not supposed to be, and the cops all feel good and feel safe.
[00:26:39.139 --> 00:26:42.260]  They tell them, oh, there's some kids out there with 16-ounce gloves.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:43.500]  Those are the big ones, folks.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.080]  You ought to see the video of this.
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.061]  Just little skinny yuppies, trendies,
[00:26:53.012 --> 00:26:54.873]  Trendy or yuppie, that's totally opposite.
[00:26:55.693 --> 00:26:57.674]  But really at the same time, the same thing.
[00:26:58.375 --> 00:26:59.736]  That's not the term I meant to use, though.
[00:26:59.776 --> 00:27:00.736]  Preppies, there we go.
[00:27:01.417 --> 00:27:04.679]  Just wildly swinging at each other with no technique.
[00:27:05.959 --> 00:27:07.540]  That's what life's all about.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:11.663]  That's what you're supposed to be doing, is wrestling and boxing and...
[00:27:12.344 --> 00:27:13.005]  We're good to go.
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:33.002]  But no, no, no, no.
[00:27:33.782 --> 00:27:35.623]  We're going to have a big scheme.
[00:27:35.883 --> 00:27:36.924]  Roger, Roger, move in.
[00:27:37.084 --> 00:27:37.364]  Move in.
[00:27:37.384 --> 00:27:38.105]  We've got the perps.
[00:27:38.145 --> 00:27:38.845]  We've got the perps.
[00:27:39.085 --> 00:27:42.747]  Meanwhile, I can drive five miles and buy crack cocaine right now.
[00:27:43.067 --> 00:27:45.028]  Crack dealers lining the streets.
[00:27:45.528 --> 00:27:46.889]  Cops driving right past them.
[00:27:47.169 --> 00:27:49.030]  You know, if I had time, that's the kind of stuff I'd do.
[00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:51.071]  I'd go rent a van, white van.
[00:27:52.054 --> 00:28:01.458]  Tenant windows, I'd mount a camera on the top, take an hour, and I would just go park in East Austin, and I would show cop cars driving right past people selling rock cocaine.
[00:28:02.178 --> 00:28:04.599]  Because I've seen it personally 50 times.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:09.762]  More than that, every time I drive down those streets to go to the AXS TV station, it's just constant.
[00:28:11.082 --> 00:28:14.364]  But that's illegal aliens committing felonies are just everywhere.
[00:28:14.944 --> 00:28:15.544]  No problem.
[00:28:16.304 --> 00:28:19.706]  But you get some kids out there...
[00:28:21.539 --> 00:28:22.700]  Assembly boxing.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.240]  People get in a square.
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.941]  They have a great time.
[00:28:26.021 --> 00:28:26.741]  It's fun.
[00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:30.703]  And, uh... Nope, nope, nope.
[00:28:31.143 --> 00:28:32.744]  Now, see, I've just spent five minutes on this.
[00:28:32.824 --> 00:28:35.965]  It's just that... Oh, you don't believe me.
[00:28:36.005 --> 00:28:38.426]  Just type dodgeball band in district.
[00:28:38.866 --> 00:28:41.047]  Or type in tag band in district.
[00:28:41.127 --> 00:28:47.030]  Or students charge for playing dodgeball.
[00:28:47.070 --> 00:28:48.991]  And you will get articles right now.
[00:28:49.071 --> 00:28:49.391]  Do it!
[00:28:50.109 --> 00:28:50.569]  Do it!
[00:28:51.050 --> 00:28:52.251]  Find out what we're becoming.
[00:28:53.331 --> 00:29:00.997]  We can have people on the radio saying torture and kill people and murder's good and torture's good and let's do all these horrible things.
[00:29:01.057 --> 00:29:04.379]  All that bizarreness is A-OK, but don't you play dodgeball.
[00:29:04.399 --> 00:29:08.242]  I mean, we're really a sick society.
[00:29:08.682 --> 00:29:11.144]  Totally and completely sick.
[00:29:11.184 --> 00:29:18.810]  Meanwhile, the government is pushing drugs that admittedly liquefy the brain and admittedly pock...
[00:29:20.089 --> 00:29:23.970]  Mark the liver and other organs and burn out your kidneys.
[00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.790]  They're just pushing it.
[00:29:24.830 --> 00:29:26.591]  Methamphetamine, you notice Ritalin.
[00:29:27.471 --> 00:29:36.954]  Psychotropic, solutionogenic derivatives and complex molecular structured brain bending drugs.
[00:29:37.014 --> 00:29:39.554]  There's tens of millions on it.
[00:29:40.095 --> 00:29:41.275]  Gobbling it up with pleasure.
[00:29:41.755 --> 00:29:44.936]  That's okay, but you don't go box and you don't go play dodgeball.
[00:29:46.056 --> 00:29:48.337]  Alright, we'll be right back with Troops in the Schools.
[00:29:51.997 --> 00:29:52.899]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.401 --> 00:29:55.004]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.926 --> 00:29:58.612]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:08.612]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:08.832 --> 00:30:13.814]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.154 --> 00:30:22.057]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:22.217 --> 00:30:29.260]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.681]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:30.841 --> 00:30:34.223]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:34.283 --> 00:30:35.403]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:35.684 --> 00:30:36.964]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:30:37.165 --> 00:30:44.008]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:44.129 --> 00:30:46.570]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:30:46.750 --> 00:30:49.674]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.694 --> 00:30:49.735]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.755 --> 00:30:50.716]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:07.873]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.013 --> 00:31:14.177]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.457 --> 00:31:22.881]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.141 --> 00:31:30.165]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.445 --> 00:31:35.288]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.488 --> 00:31:40.892]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.252 --> 00:31:44.334]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.655 --> 00:31:52.620]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.240]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:02.907]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:32:03.067 --> 00:32:04.208]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:04.368 --> 00:32:07.790]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:08.330]  Phenol?
[00:32:08.651 --> 00:32:15.776]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:16.076 --> 00:32:20.179]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:20.279 --> 00:32:20.719]  Fragrance?
[00:32:21.099 --> 00:32:25.843]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:25.983 --> 00:32:30.687]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:32:30.907 --> 00:32:33.449]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[00:32:33.709 --> 00:32:37.131]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:32:37.272 --> 00:32:40.854]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:32:41.034 --> 00:32:43.396]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:32:43.556 --> 00:32:44.357]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:44.537 --> 00:32:54.302]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[00:32:54.482 --> 00:32:57.063]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[00:32:57.083 --> 00:32:58.364]  We're going to be talking to...
[00:33:12.467 --> 00:33:21.154]  Elijah Romo, a father who tried to go pick his child up to school yesterday at the local middle school and had to go through the troops.
[00:33:21.694 --> 00:33:22.475]  That's right.
[00:33:23.095 --> 00:33:25.197]  They're just here because the kid's been misbehaving.
[00:33:25.217 --> 00:33:27.058]  You got a problem with it, boy?
[00:33:27.078 --> 00:33:28.920]  It's the new America.
[00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:29.740]  Get used to it.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:35.665]  I mean, this is just creeping death, creeping tyranny right in front of you.
[00:33:35.725 --> 00:33:36.606]  So bizarre.
[00:33:37.646 --> 00:33:41.029]  And folks, there's so much that is happening, I can't even track it all.
[00:33:41.704 --> 00:33:43.285]  I can't even cover it all.
[00:33:43.345 --> 00:33:45.007]  I can't even talk about it all.
[00:33:46.768 --> 00:33:48.049]  And they're putting stuff in our air.
[00:33:48.089 --> 00:33:49.310]  They're putting stuff in our water.
[00:33:49.330 --> 00:33:50.531]  They're manipulating us.
[00:33:51.552 --> 00:33:53.353]  It's blasphemous.
[00:33:53.393 --> 00:33:54.694]  They see us as cattle.
[00:33:55.035 --> 00:33:56.235]  They see us as slaves.
[00:33:57.196 --> 00:33:57.777]  But I know this.
[00:33:57.817 --> 00:33:58.777]  People are waking up.
[00:33:58.797 --> 00:34:00.359]  People are taking control of their lives.
[00:34:00.699 --> 00:34:01.480]  And it's exciting.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:04.482]  We'll talk to Elijah Romo here in just a second.
[00:34:05.022 --> 00:34:10.747]  For the next three minutes or so, though, I'm honored to be joined by Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts, the maid in America.
[00:34:11.774 --> 00:34:13.235]  Burke Feld water filters.
[00:34:13.255 --> 00:34:14.335]  They also have Made in Britain.
[00:34:14.395 --> 00:34:16.296]  If you prefer those, they're both excellent.
[00:34:16.777 --> 00:34:19.718]  Though the Made in America, according to University Studies, is even better.
[00:34:19.758 --> 00:34:20.478]  A new standard.
[00:34:20.999 --> 00:34:22.059]  Below detectable levels.
[00:34:22.099 --> 00:34:23.920]  There's just nothing in it after it goes through it.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.362]  And they're about $100 less than Chinese and Indian knockoffs.
[00:34:28.542 --> 00:34:28.943]  Literally.
[00:34:29.463 --> 00:34:32.524]  And I bought Big Berkey before I ever even had them as a sponsor.
[00:34:32.544 --> 00:34:36.346]  Though they've been sponsors now for, I guess, about four years.
[00:34:36.426 --> 00:34:37.747]  Four and a half, five years actually.
[00:34:38.995 --> 00:34:46.201]  Debbie, tell us about some of the Christmas holiday, maybe politically correct, Xmas specials, I mean sarcastic folks.
[00:34:46.621 --> 00:34:48.063]  Tell us about some of the specials, Debbie.
[00:34:48.843 --> 00:34:49.964]  I have things.
[00:34:50.965 --> 00:35:01.454]  We have, you know, we want to encourage people to buy these as holiday gifts instead of, you know, going out and buying a bunch of junk that nobody will use hardly.
[00:35:02.074 --> 00:35:05.277]  And so what we're doing is we're making it available that if you buy four
[00:35:06.129 --> 00:35:19.559]  Of the Berkey lights without the lights, for $1.99 each, you can get seven Berkey Sport bottles, which are not the generic label, but the actual Berkey Sport bottles for $39 each.
[00:35:19.679 --> 00:35:20.780]  You get those for free.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:33.210]  Or you can get four of the Royal Berkeys, which are the stainless steel two-filter black filter systems that hold three and a quarter gallons.
[00:35:33.979 --> 00:35:40.123]  And you can get four of those for $2.60 a piece and get 10 free Berkey sport bottles.
[00:35:40.944 --> 00:35:50.730]  So it's a really great deal because not only do you get the gifts that you're going to give as far as the Berkey lights, but you get the sport bottles that you can give as trade gifts.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:59.406]  Now, what about people who aren't David Rockefeller and can't afford that many of the units, which is a great gift to give people?
[00:35:59.807 --> 00:36:01.268]  Tell us about some of the other choices.
[00:36:01.628 --> 00:36:09.474]  If they can't, you know, if they don't want to do the whole big thing like that, then, you know, you can get the four generic labeled Berkey Sport bottles.
[00:36:09.914 --> 00:36:16.339]  I'm sorry, five generic labels for Berkey Sport bottles for $99, or you can get 12.
[00:36:19.335 --> 00:36:19.696]  For $199.
[00:36:20.117 --> 00:36:23.865]  And those make great trade gifts.
[00:36:24.066 --> 00:36:26.010]  And also, you can get the Berkey Light.
[00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:28.276]  Let's say you just get a Berkey Light by itself.
[00:36:29.264 --> 00:36:31.766]  Get one free generic labeled sport bottle.
[00:36:32.307 --> 00:36:33.608]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:36:33.928 --> 00:36:37.531]  Generic labeled, I mean, there really is no difference.
[00:36:37.551 --> 00:36:38.972]  It's the exact same filter.
[00:36:39.272 --> 00:36:39.773]  Exactly.
[00:36:39.793 --> 00:36:41.814]  The only thing is it doesn't have the writing on it.
[00:36:42.114 --> 00:36:44.296]  Well, I've just got to have that writing.
[00:36:44.576 --> 00:36:51.982]  Well, some people want the writing to give as a gift, you know, make it look real nice, whereas other ones don't care and it's just plain blank, you know.
[00:36:52.042 --> 00:36:55.145]  It's the same bottle and it's the same filter and everything in it.
[00:36:55.695 --> 00:36:57.796]  And they're so great to take places.
[00:36:58.156 --> 00:37:03.559]  The sport bottles, they're just a wonderful thing to take with you all the time on the go.
[00:37:04.039 --> 00:37:12.483]  Well, they really are because they do 630 refills of tap water, cutting out the garbage and making it taste good and be a lot healthier.
[00:37:13.423 --> 00:37:14.984]  Or it does what?
[00:37:15.004 --> 00:37:18.906]  160 of pond or lake water.
[00:37:19.126 --> 00:37:21.187]  So, folks, this is a little sports bottle.
[00:37:21.847 --> 00:37:22.568]  We're good to go.
[00:37:37.024 --> 00:37:37.664]  We're good to go.
[00:38:01.475 --> 00:38:02.496]  Real easy to put together.
[00:38:02.516 --> 00:38:03.797]  That's $1.99.
[00:38:04.398 --> 00:38:05.478]  I still get a free gift for that.
[00:38:05.799 --> 00:38:09.942]  Also, what if I want the stainless steel black Berkey system?
[00:38:10.322 --> 00:38:15.587]  If you want the stainless steel systems, we have four models available.
[00:38:16.167 --> 00:38:19.330]  And you get two of the Berkey Sport bottles with each one.
[00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.571]  And I'll go over it with people when they call in.
[00:38:22.642 --> 00:38:26.863]  Because there are so many wonderful free gifts that we make available to people.
[00:38:26.943 --> 00:38:29.264]  And there are a bunch of different specials going right now.
[00:38:29.284 --> 00:38:30.644]  This is Made in America.
[00:38:30.664 --> 00:38:31.705]  It supports freedom.
[00:38:32.105 --> 00:38:33.285]  Helps us get the word out.
[00:38:33.885 --> 00:38:39.787]  And if you just can't find a better deal than simply getting it from New Millennium Concepts, give Debbie a call right now, folks.
[00:38:39.807 --> 00:38:39.907]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:38:39.927 --> 00:38:39.967]  888-803-4438.
[00:38:47.129 --> 00:38:50.991]  Or simply go online at BerkeyWater.com and tell them it's an Alex Jones special.
[00:38:51.471 --> 00:38:59.814]  And in the comments section, tell them what free gift you want, whether it's a Sheltering in Place DVD or a sports bottle or potassium iodate or a bunch of other great free gifts.
[00:39:00.314 --> 00:39:05.476]  That's BerkeyWater.com, where you get the exact same specials and information in order at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:05.496 --> 00:39:09.818]  That number, again, in case you missed it, 888-803-4438.
[00:39:10.118 --> 00:39:12.419]  And if you're calling tonight, just leave your name and number twice.
[00:39:13.357 --> 00:39:17.021]  And Debbie, we'll call you back tomorrow if you're listening to the show at night.
[00:39:17.422 --> 00:39:18.283]  You can simply do that.
[00:39:18.323 --> 00:39:19.604]  Debbie, always good to hear from you.
[00:39:19.624 --> 00:39:20.425]  We'll talk to you tomorrow.
[00:39:20.665 --> 00:39:21.406]  Thank you.
[00:39:21.466 --> 00:39:22.447]  Have a great day.
[00:39:22.808 --> 00:39:23.489]  Take care, Debbie.
[00:39:23.769 --> 00:39:27.173]  She's had, I guess, kind of laryngitis the last few weeks, and it's good to hear her getting better.
[00:39:27.193 --> 00:39:28.895]  That stuff is really nasty.
[00:39:29.255 --> 00:39:33.420]  I almost get that sometimes with these allergies out here, all these wonderful little allergies floating around.
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:36.501]  But we can control what's in our water, and we should.
[00:39:36.981 --> 00:39:38.662]  So, 888-803-4438.
[00:39:39.162 --> 00:39:50.606]  Okay, I appreciate folks holding through that, but it is a very important, very important sponsor, and one of those rare American companies actually manufacturing and selling something here, and they support freedom, and it's a great product.
[00:39:51.866 --> 00:39:54.367]  Now, we're going to go to Elijah Romo.
[00:39:55.456 --> 00:40:09.928]  And we're honored to have Elijah on with us, and he's gotten some photos and some video that we're going to be getting up in the next few days and getting a story out today, a little blurb out on this today, and then a more lengthy story to give us enough time by next week with the photos and the video.
[00:40:10.468 --> 00:40:17.354]  And Elijah Romo went to pick up his children there at the Zachary Middle School by 1604 in Calabria.
[00:40:20.709 --> 00:40:28.352]  And Elijah, just start at the beginning and then move through what has now happened subsequently, sir, please.
[00:40:29.372 --> 00:40:32.113]  Well, I want to make a correction.
[00:40:32.753 --> 00:40:36.014]  My kids don't go to that school, but I passed by that school.
[00:40:36.054 --> 00:40:37.695]  Okay, I was confused then.
[00:40:37.735 --> 00:40:38.755]  I was confused by that.
[00:40:40.236 --> 00:40:45.678]  Well, after I was coming back from dropping my kids off to school... Can you guys boost him for me?
[00:40:46.018 --> 00:40:46.798]  His audio is low.
[00:40:47.458 --> 00:40:48.379]  I'm really sorry, Elijah.
[00:40:48.399 --> 00:40:48.719]  Go ahead.
[00:40:50.336 --> 00:40:50.576]  Okay.
[00:40:51.276 --> 00:40:52.157]  What was the question again?
[00:40:52.537 --> 00:40:54.077]  Well, I mean, let's just start at the beginning.
[00:40:54.837 --> 00:40:59.518]  I mean, I remember yesterday you called in as a caller and you talked about being over there and something to do with your kids.
[00:41:00.159 --> 00:41:01.079]  That's how I got confused.
[00:41:01.099 --> 00:41:01.799]  But, I mean, just go back.
[00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:02.499]  You're driving by.
[00:41:02.559 --> 00:41:03.139]  What do you see?
[00:41:03.420 --> 00:41:04.020]  What happens?
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:04.680]  You called them.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:05.440]  You went over there.
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.741]  You know, go through the chain of events for us, Elijah.
[00:41:07.821 --> 00:41:08.021]  Okay.
[00:41:08.041 --> 00:41:15.623]  As I was driving back from dropping off my son from school and as I was going on a four-way stop, I saw...
[00:41:17.213 --> 00:41:20.674]  These men dressed in military fatigues.
[00:41:20.794 --> 00:41:22.075]  You see, that's where I got confused.
[00:41:22.115 --> 00:41:26.356]  Yesterday you said I was driving to the school to drop him off, so it was the school, what, down the street.
[00:41:26.396 --> 00:41:27.317]  That's how I got confused.
[00:41:27.777 --> 00:41:28.517]  Okay.
[00:41:28.737 --> 00:41:29.797]  But it's a small side issue.
[00:41:29.817 --> 00:41:30.358]  Please continue.
[00:41:30.538 --> 00:41:32.658]  So you're driving along, you see men in military fatigues.
[00:41:33.319 --> 00:41:45.163]  And then as I turned the corner, I decided to go inside the campus, outside the campus, and I saw a campus police officer, and I asked him...
[00:41:46.232 --> 00:41:47.033]  What was going on?
[00:41:47.233 --> 00:41:53.037]  And then I guess he was already anticipating what I was going to say.
[00:41:53.677 --> 00:41:56.059]  And then he says, oh, okay, you're not the first one.
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:08.087]  We just hired these people because of the fact that the principal felt that there was a lot of disturbance with the students outside.
[00:42:08.107 --> 00:42:15.532]  And so they decided to hire these people to act as crossing guards.
[00:42:18.482 --> 00:42:24.087]  So, just out in the open, we need to call in troops, because the kids have not been behaving.
[00:42:24.207 --> 00:42:25.048]  Only troops.
[00:42:25.108 --> 00:42:26.970]  See, troops fix everything.
[00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:28.972]  If you've got a broken sink, call troops.
[00:42:29.052 --> 00:42:31.014]  If you get cancer, call troops.
[00:42:31.074 --> 00:42:33.656]  If you need a ride to the airport, call the troops.
[00:42:34.077 --> 00:42:35.398]  Troops, troops everywhere.
[00:42:36.219 --> 00:42:39.582]  Please continue, Elijah, because you began to dig into what was really going on.
[00:42:40.242 --> 00:42:42.384]  Well, when I went back home and...
[00:42:44.986 --> 00:42:57.689]  I decided to call the school and at the school they said that they're volunteers, not to worry about anything, that they're volunteers and that they're devoting their time and so forth.
[00:42:57.789 --> 00:43:14.192]  But I'm thinking, you know, you're reading the paper or you see on the TV that you've got these reserves and that we're depleted in resources and troops and then you have them as crossing guards.
[00:43:15.252 --> 00:43:19.763]  And the Northside School District, I mean, they got plenty of volunteers.
[00:43:19.843 --> 00:43:24.093]  If you ask the volunteers, people are just willing to volunteer.
[00:43:25.191 --> 00:43:31.655]  Well, right here in front of my office every day, there's a nice retired Hispanic gentleman.
[00:43:31.695 --> 00:43:36.858]  He wears his old military cap, his veteran's cap, and he's out there helping the kids cross the street every day.
[00:43:36.898 --> 00:43:39.020]  I mean, there's plenty of people that want to volunteer.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.821]  That's total balderdash that we need troops to do it.
[00:43:42.582 --> 00:43:46.604]  But notice you get from the security guard that because we've had some disturbances.
[00:43:46.885 --> 00:43:49.006]  Now, what did you hear from the school when you talked to them?
[00:43:50.512 --> 00:43:56.215]  Well, they told me not to be alarmed, that this was something that they wanted to try something different.
[00:43:57.315 --> 00:44:02.538]  And that the principal, if I'm correct, this is the name of the game, Ms.
[00:44:02.578 --> 00:44:10.682]  Martinez, that she thought that with these type of people that they could get a little bit more respect from them.
[00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:15.825]  Ah, the troops will intimidate and get the children in line.
[00:44:16.765 --> 00:44:17.045]  Yes.
[00:44:18.906 --> 00:44:19.026]  And...
[00:44:20.798 --> 00:44:48.410]  As I was taking pictures, I took a disposable camera and also a camcorder, and one of the campus police officers, that's why I got a little bit nervous, because as he was approaching me, he was looking at what I was doing, and I was afraid that he was going to confiscate my camera.
[00:44:49.344 --> 00:44:52.487]  My camera and... Were you on the school grounds?
[00:44:53.167 --> 00:44:55.309]  I was in three different locations on the school.
[00:44:55.996 --> 00:45:00.017]  And the third one was to get a better angle.
[00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:02.858]  Well, look, you have great courage, sir, but let me just give you the background.
[00:45:03.078 --> 00:45:04.198]  I've done this a lot with cameras.
[00:45:04.498 --> 00:45:09.740]  If you act like you're the boss, most of these minions, then you are the boss.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:18.262]  If you do act with a little bit of trepidation, they take that as some type of dominance thing, that it's then their right to dominate you.
[00:45:18.702 --> 00:45:20.723]  Okay, so she's walking up.
[00:45:21.183 --> 00:45:22.624]  You're a little bit intimidated by it.
[00:45:23.184 --> 00:45:23.844]  What happens next?
[00:45:25.208 --> 00:45:33.531]  Well, I just pretended that I was doing some kind of a report, and I had a little clipboard.
[00:45:33.952 --> 00:45:35.072]  Well, you're not pretending, sir.
[00:45:35.092 --> 00:45:36.092]  You're reporting for us.
[00:45:38.413 --> 00:45:42.595]  Well, you know, I was a little bit nervous the first time I do that.
[00:45:43.355 --> 00:45:46.557]  I mean, I'd ask you yesterday on air to go get footage for it, to be our reporter.
[00:45:46.577 --> 00:45:47.197]  You did do that.
[00:45:47.697 --> 00:45:48.517]  Yes, yes.
[00:45:49.058 --> 00:45:52.579]  And it's just, you know, I got a...
[00:45:53.593 --> 00:45:54.974]  I got a little bit nervous, you know.
[00:45:55.014 --> 00:45:56.355]  What did her lordship say to you?
[00:45:56.375 --> 00:45:57.175]  Excuse me?
[00:45:57.896 --> 00:46:03.459]  What did the campus prison officer, what did the prison guard say to you?
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:08.382]  Well, he just looked at what I had and he says, what are you doing?
[00:46:08.402 --> 00:46:10.903]  And I just said that I was doing a report.
[00:46:11.163 --> 00:46:12.624]  Oh, so it was a he, it was a he, okay.
[00:46:12.684 --> 00:46:14.045]  It was a he, yes.
[00:46:14.345 --> 00:46:17.067]  And he just paused for a little while and
[00:46:18.232 --> 00:46:24.515]  I just decided to take off.
[00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:26.015]  Did you ask them any questions?
[00:46:26.176 --> 00:46:27.436]  Why are the troops here on camera?
[00:46:28.136 --> 00:46:33.859]  Well, I asked them in the morning, the very first time in the morning I asked them, because I came back in the afternoon.
[00:46:34.417 --> 00:46:36.879]  But in the morning was when I didn't have anything.
[00:46:37.279 --> 00:46:38.340]  Now, let's make clear, though.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:55.811]  I believe you said on air yesterday, or it might have been on the cell phone when we were talking, after the show, didn't the jail guard, they're not really campus cops, didn't the prison guard or the prison social worker training the children how to be prisoners, didn't the prison inductee...
[00:46:59.740 --> 00:47:15.673]  Well, yes, it's like they were already anticipating what I was going to say because they were already talking to somebody that was probably a concerned parent.
[00:47:16.053 --> 00:47:16.934]  What specifically?
[00:47:16.974 --> 00:47:18.175]  I know you're going from everywhere.
[00:47:18.215 --> 00:47:20.216]  What specifically did the prison guard say?
[00:47:21.237 --> 00:47:24.220]  Well, they gave me two different stories.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:26.902]  The campus police officer told me that
[00:47:27.566 --> 00:47:28.647]  They had hired them.
[00:47:29.147 --> 00:47:32.849]  She had gotten approval from the district.
[00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:41.114]  But when I called, when I got home, they said that they didn't hire them, that they were volunteers.
[00:47:41.194 --> 00:47:43.195]  So I'm getting two different stories.
[00:47:43.256 --> 00:47:47.358]  Well, Mr. Romo, I know you've been a listener and you've also seen my films.
[00:47:47.398 --> 00:47:48.739]  You're pretty much up to speed.
[00:47:48.759 --> 00:47:51.480]  But San Antonio is one of their main testing grounds.
[00:47:52.761 --> 00:47:55.503]  At least five years ago, in fact, I think it was longer, was it five?
[00:47:56.576 --> 00:47:57.777]  No, it was back in 2000.
[00:47:57.817 --> 00:48:02.460]  We got footage, first from a listener, then we went down there and got it, which I put on TV.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:03.541]  It's never been in a film.
[00:48:03.921 --> 00:48:05.002]  We got so much of this.
[00:48:06.143 --> 00:48:07.804]  But it's been on here locally.
[00:48:08.805 --> 00:48:11.807]  They had MPs coming up asking us questions.
[00:48:11.847 --> 00:48:15.710]  They were checking everyone's ID just walking down the street.
[00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:20.433]  It was really bizarre, and this is all part of a mass conditioning program.
[00:48:20.453 --> 00:48:21.394]  But I want to get your take.
[00:48:21.674 --> 00:48:22.855]  What do you think all this is about?
[00:48:23.516 --> 00:48:28.519]  Well, I actually have an article from the Edgewood School District.
[00:48:29.660 --> 00:48:41.488]  They were doing some tourism exercises with campus police, with the military, and some other government agencies.
[00:48:41.648 --> 00:48:42.348]  This is new.
[00:48:42.388 --> 00:48:43.729]  You see, I'm running on at the mouth.
[00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:49.173]  Is this tied into what you saw yesterday, or is this something else you've now discovered?
[00:48:49.573 --> 00:48:50.974]  It's something else that I discovered.
[00:48:51.134 --> 00:48:52.735]  I actually have it on an article.
[00:48:53.345 --> 00:48:55.606]  That came out in the San Antonio Express.
[00:48:55.766 --> 00:48:57.948]  When did that come out in the Express News?
[00:48:59.469 --> 00:49:01.190]  Probably during the summer.
[00:49:02.590 --> 00:49:07.253]  It came out in the summer, but it had... What was the headline on it?
[00:49:08.774 --> 00:49:11.275]  I would have to get the article out.
[00:49:11.536 --> 00:49:11.716]  Sure.
[00:49:11.736 --> 00:49:13.116]  What did they specifically say, though?
[00:49:13.597 --> 00:49:14.697]  Well, it was for terrorism.
[00:49:15.198 --> 00:49:20.241]  It was for terrorism, and what they were using was... I'm familiar with the Edgewood School District.
[00:49:20.301 --> 00:49:22.202]  It's a poor district, and they used...
[00:49:23.371 --> 00:49:29.537]  The poverty districts to do all these tourism exercises.
[00:49:29.617 --> 00:49:43.910]  And they were also using the portable buildings that they used, the portables, to do some, you know, that scenario where somebody comes and brings a gun and
[00:49:44.665 --> 00:49:47.447]  They do lockdown and... Was the military involved?
[00:49:47.547 --> 00:49:47.728]  Yes.
[00:49:49.189 --> 00:49:50.650]  Total violation of federal law.
[00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:51.431]  Totally criminal.
[00:49:52.111 --> 00:49:58.136]  Now, I'm sure you're aware that Ale Philippus, your old police chief, threw Delta Force out in 99 for trying to bribe him.
[00:49:58.156 --> 00:50:01.619]  That was in the San Antonio Express News, and we went down and interviewed him.
[00:50:01.639 --> 00:50:02.300]  Were you aware of that?
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.702]  Yes, I actually have the article with me.
[00:50:08.827 --> 00:50:10.488]  See how this creeping death works, folks?
[00:50:10.528 --> 00:50:13.030]  It just continually gets worse and worse.
[00:50:13.310 --> 00:50:14.791]  Oh, the troops are here to make the kids behave.
[00:50:14.831 --> 00:50:16.132]  Oh, the troops are here to fight terrorism.
[00:50:16.392 --> 00:50:17.033]  Oh, the troops are here.
[00:50:17.073 --> 00:50:18.054]  Oh, the Delta Force is here.
[00:50:19.134 --> 00:50:20.075]  Just over and over.
[00:50:20.095 --> 00:50:22.957]  And then magically the terrorism appears right on time.
[00:50:22.997 --> 00:50:29.422]  And I'm not too sure if you're familiar with the National Security Agency.
[00:50:30.503 --> 00:50:32.444]  They are relocated here to San Antonio.
[00:50:33.365 --> 00:50:34.185]  The NSA?
[00:50:34.626 --> 00:50:34.826]  Yes.
[00:50:35.812 --> 00:50:37.934]  I know they have a major node down there.
[00:50:37.955 --> 00:50:40.998]  They have a nice front company here in Austin, too.
[00:50:41.018 --> 00:50:42.920]  They've got some offices right down off First Street.
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.242]  Yeah, we know where you're at, boys.
[00:50:45.723 --> 00:50:47.104]  You're not going to destroy America.
[00:50:47.144 --> 00:50:47.945]  We stand against you.
[00:50:48.285 --> 00:50:50.127]  Tell you what, stay there, Mr. Romo.
[00:50:50.167 --> 00:50:50.468]  Come back.
[00:50:50.488 --> 00:50:51.889]  I want to do one more segment with you, please.
[00:50:51.909 --> 00:50:53.811]  I know you're busy and got to get back to work.
[00:50:54.472 --> 00:50:57.615]  But I want to talk about this some more on the other side.
[00:50:57.635 --> 00:50:58.136]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.627 --> 00:51:05.974]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.154 --> 00:51:10.601]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.741 --> 00:51:15.108]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.148 --> 00:51:16.510]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.272 --> 00:51:22.494]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.555 --> 00:51:29.479]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.619 --> 00:51:31.700]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:42.407]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.627 --> 00:51:43.848]  If you want to understand what the new
[00:51:43.848 --> 00:51:44.048]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:44.088 --> 00:51:45.630]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:52:01.138 --> 00:52:08.643]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:08.923 --> 00:52:19.831]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.111 --> 00:52:21.913]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.174 --> 00:52:25.498]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:25.838 --> 00:52:36.291]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.591 --> 00:52:37.072]  That's right.
[00:52:37.272 --> 00:52:44.379]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.679 --> 00:52:52.987]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.107 --> 00:52:53.648]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:02.952 --> 00:53:08.894]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.134 --> 00:53:11.375]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.575 --> 00:53:15.916]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500ppm, Olive Leaf Extract,
[00:53:18.257 --> 00:53:18.918]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.513 --> 00:53:39.113]  We're good to go.
[00:54:10.187 --> 00:54:18.937]  We've got another very important guest coming up in about 30 minutes in the next hour and then we'll have open phones to balance the broadcast.
[00:54:29.714 --> 00:54:36.937]  A whole stack, as usual, of just incredible news here in front of me, internationally, nationally, more evidence of government-sponsored terror.
[00:54:37.577 --> 00:54:46.921]  Clearly now, the evidence, the preponderance of the evidence, points directly at Western intelligence involvement in the bombings over in Jordan last week.
[00:54:47.041 --> 00:54:49.542]  We'll get into that and so much more.
[00:54:50.122 --> 00:54:59.066]  We're talking to Elijah Romo, who was dropping off his son to school down the street from the Zachary Middle School, and he drove by and saw troops out there.
[00:54:59.902 --> 00:55:03.083]  Now, you said you saw more troops out there today, correct, sir?
[00:55:04.203 --> 00:55:04.463]  Yes.
[00:55:05.243 --> 00:55:05.543]  Yes.
[00:55:05.983 --> 00:55:15.605]  There were, I don't know if there were changing from the people that were outside with people that were inside the building.
[00:55:16.846 --> 00:55:22.687]  So it's kind of hard to get closer with the campus police and stuff like that.
[00:55:23.251 --> 00:55:27.594]  Well, this is just like drug pushers targeting children with cocaine and heroin.
[00:55:27.694 --> 00:55:30.255]  I mean, Hitler targeted children.
[00:55:30.615 --> 00:55:34.077]  They're trying to move in in a controlled environment where the parents are shut out.
[00:55:34.397 --> 00:55:46.885]  Notice the schools all over the country won't let you in now or you've got a thumb scan to get in or there's fences and it's all secretive and there's counselors pushing drugs and school district psychiatrists walking around with stethoscopes.
[00:55:47.265 --> 00:55:49.306]  You know, it's just all real scary.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:54.663]  This isn't what America's supposed to be.
[00:55:54.784 --> 00:55:55.925]  Meanwhile, the border's wide open.
[00:55:56.025 --> 00:55:59.329]  We've got to keep you safe from terrorism, but the border's wide open.
[00:55:59.349 --> 00:56:00.170]  Again, none of it adds up.
[00:56:12.937 --> 00:56:15.658]  Anything else you'd like to add, Elijah, about what's happening?
[00:56:15.898 --> 00:56:30.684]  Yes, what I did like to add was that I contacted a couple of TV stations and WOAI, which is a major radio station here in San Antonio, and nobody was interested.
[00:56:31.184 --> 00:56:40.067]  And I was kind of surprised because, you know, I might be wrong, but what does the military have to do with, you know,
[00:56:40.649 --> 00:56:43.411]  Being in the public school setting.
[00:56:43.451 --> 00:56:49.515]  Well, they passed a law that they're allowed to aggressively recruit inside the classrooms of Point Blank Range, but this isn't even that.
[00:56:49.895 --> 00:56:51.056]  We know what that was really about.
[00:56:51.116 --> 00:56:52.277]  It's about policing.
[00:56:52.977 --> 00:56:59.542]  Look, they have to wear Army of One ID tags around their necks at several major schools here in Austin.
[00:56:59.562 --> 00:57:00.783]  We've done TV reports on it.
[00:57:01.143 --> 00:57:06.907]  The kids walk around with Army of One necklaces, almost an inch wide lanyards.
[00:57:07.618 --> 00:57:09.119]  And it's just all conditioning.
[00:57:09.699 --> 00:57:10.580]  It's all conditioning.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:12.681]  What did the troops do when they saw you out there with a camera?
[00:57:13.822 --> 00:57:28.030]  Well, the fact that they couldn't leave their area, that was to my advantage because I knew that I was in a certain amount of distance to where I wasn't too close to them, to where they wouldn't confront me.
[00:57:28.911 --> 00:57:30.252]  You know, I've been detained.
[00:57:31.082 --> 00:57:31.342]  Well, uh...
[00:57:59.348 --> 00:58:06.811]  The thing about it is that it's something that people are denying it, but I've been to Transguide.
[00:58:06.831 --> 00:58:14.634]  I'm not too sure if they're familiar where that is located, but that's right there for the 410, I-10 interchanges.
[00:58:15.714 --> 00:58:20.136]  And I've been in there, and they have the military.
[00:58:20.756 --> 00:58:21.856]  They have the fire department.
[00:58:21.876 --> 00:58:23.937]  They have the police department.
[00:58:23.977 --> 00:58:25.438]  They have TxDOT.
[00:58:27.037 --> 00:58:28.939]  And it's like a command center.
[00:58:30.260 --> 00:58:36.685]  Every major city has a command center with the Central Intelligence Agency over it, merging the military and the police.
[00:58:36.865 --> 00:58:37.226]  You know what?
[00:58:38.046 --> 00:58:38.387]  Stay there.
[00:58:38.427 --> 00:58:40.048]  Let's see if you can do a few more minutes.
[00:58:41.929 --> 00:58:46.173]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:58.257 --> 00:58:58.898]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.558 --> 00:59:00.619]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.319 --> 00:59:02.420]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.080 --> 00:59:03.901]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.661 --> 00:59:05.582]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.222 --> 00:59:09.864]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.405 --> 00:59:14.527]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.889 --> 00:59:21.532]  In the movie Red Dawn, set during a Soviet takeover of the Midwest...
[00:59:23.027 --> 00:59:28.828]  In the Rocky Mountains, there are troops in the grocery stores, at the mall, on the streets, tattletailing neighbors.
[00:59:29.728 --> 00:59:32.869]  They find plenty of mayors who are willing to serve them.
[00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:39.890]  That's the Hollywood nightmare image, or in the real world, in Cuba, or in Russia, or in Nazi Germany.
[00:59:41.831 --> 00:59:45.532]  But it's happening right here in America.
[00:59:45.592 --> 00:59:49.352]  The troops are openly trying to take your guns, break you and your family up.
[00:59:49.612 --> 00:59:52.633]  Now, something that was covered up years ago is public.
[00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:53.931]  It's admitted.
[00:59:53.991 --> 00:59:56.752]  It's openly discussed on the nightly news how good it is.
[00:59:56.812 --> 00:59:59.033]  Troops arresting people is good.
[00:59:59.573 --> 01:00:01.073]  They're going to be out in Mardi Gras arresting.
[01:00:01.093 --> 01:00:02.354]  They're going to be at the local school.
[01:00:02.394 --> 01:00:06.895]  They're going to be... They come in and tell the kids, kids, we're here to teach you about martial law.
[01:00:07.835 --> 01:00:10.036]  That's mainstream major papers.
[01:00:10.316 --> 01:00:10.956]  Like it's good.
[01:00:11.016 --> 01:00:12.556]  Oh, they're here to teach us martial law.
[01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:21.299]  Well, the troops are down here at the Zachary Middle School off 1604 and Calabria just to teach the kids a little respect.
[01:00:24.093 --> 01:00:26.175]  And it's going to get worse and worse and worse.
[01:00:27.216 --> 01:00:33.762]  Well, I've got to have my job, my job is supporting the troops domestically here in Operation American Freedom.
[01:00:34.682 --> 01:00:35.923]  This is dictatorship.
[01:00:37.345 --> 01:00:38.366]  This is the takeover.
[01:00:38.406 --> 01:00:40.267]  This is what it looks like when Hitler takes over.
[01:00:40.988 --> 01:00:44.011]  We're fighting it right now, but the average person just can't believe what's going on.
[01:00:44.231 --> 01:00:50.076]  You know, I believe that a lot of Germans didn't know that the Nazis were killing people because people live with their heads in the dirt.
[01:00:51.883 --> 01:00:58.551]  All they're thinking about is themselves and their bank account or how cool they are or how much beer they're going to drink.
[01:00:59.132 --> 01:01:03.898]  And there could be a smokestack burning human body parts a mile away.
[01:01:03.938 --> 01:01:04.439]  They don't know.
[01:01:04.779 --> 01:01:05.300]  They don't care.
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:09.160]  Real fast, letting our guests finish up.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.601]  We discovered this, and we have confirmed it.
[01:01:10.621 --> 01:01:12.041]  It's going on in San Antonio and other areas.
[01:01:12.381 --> 01:01:18.143]  Elijah Romo, he mentioned a particular command base down there in San Antonio.
[01:01:18.183 --> 01:01:24.705]  I'm familiar with these all over the country, where they move the Army, the National Guard, the police, FEMA, all in together.
[01:01:24.725 --> 01:01:28.446]  And then, of course, FEMA is giving all the orders, a lot of CIA liaison.
[01:01:28.686 --> 01:01:30.887]  But tell us about the command base down in San Antonio.
[01:01:31.527 --> 01:01:35.228]  Well, it's called Transguide, and the pretext is that...
[01:01:36.619 --> 01:01:39.060]  It's for emergency purposes.
[01:01:39.581 --> 01:01:44.523]  They have these screens in the freeways where they say there's a major accident up ahead.
[01:01:45.664 --> 01:01:55.289]  And, you know, it's supposed to help the congestion.
[01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:59.291]  It's an emergency that the federal brain can control everything.
[01:02:00.410 --> 01:02:02.311]  But I've been in there.
[01:02:02.652 --> 01:02:06.734]  I've been inside with the pretext of saying that I'm doing something for school.
[01:02:08.015 --> 01:02:13.538]  And all of the material that they have is international companies.
[01:02:14.699 --> 01:02:17.261]  And they take you on a tour.
[01:02:18.262 --> 01:02:29.849]  If it's for anything but religious or anything anti-government, if it's anti... Of course, if you're going over there to present something critical of them, then of course they will not.
[01:02:30.734 --> 01:02:37.440]  Do that, but it's cameras all over the city, and it's to monitor.
[01:02:39.221 --> 01:02:40.302]  No, I'm familiar with it.
[01:02:40.382 --> 01:02:44.085]  That's your local FEMA command base, Emergency Management Center.
[01:02:45.066 --> 01:02:59.698]  Yes, and they have even the hospitals that represent the hospitals, representing the, you know, power department, police department, the county, you know, TxDOT.
[01:03:01.506 --> 01:03:12.154]  And the thing about that is that they also have all the major, they have cameras in the major intersections, in all the intersections.
[01:03:12.214 --> 01:03:23.122]  And I know San Antonio is an experiment, San Antonio, and if I'm correct, San Diego, because San Diego and San Antonio, we're close to the border.
[01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:26.731]  And they have a... No, no, you hit the nail on the head.
[01:03:26.751 --> 01:03:34.116]  San Antonio had the weird license plate scanners and the antennae and all of it before Houston or Dallas even did.
[01:03:34.136 --> 01:03:34.857]  I remember 10 years ago.
[01:03:34.937 --> 01:03:40.821]  Actually, I have all of the material that they were providing to the citizens.
[01:03:40.861 --> 01:03:41.522]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:03:41.602 --> 01:03:45.184]  I can't wait to get the video you shot and the photos you took and to get it up on the website.
[01:03:45.484 --> 01:03:47.226]  And we'll talk to you soon, okay, Elijah?
[01:03:47.246 --> 01:03:47.706]  Good job.
[01:03:48.006 --> 01:03:48.887]  Okay, thank you very much.
[01:03:48.967 --> 01:03:49.547]  Thanks a million.
[01:03:49.567 --> 01:03:50.008]  You keep it up.
[01:03:50.028 --> 01:03:50.988]  I want to see that material.
[01:03:51.689 --> 01:03:52.709]  Great American right there.
[01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:58.192]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:58.452 --> 01:04:00.033]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:00.353 --> 01:04:05.036]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:05.377 --> 01:04:12.101]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:12.441 --> 01:04:14.422]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:14.623 --> 01:04:17.465]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.565 --> 01:04:22.228]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[01:07:02.312 --> 01:07:12.400]  A lot of news coming up later in the shower concerning the individuals that died in those precision blasts in Jordan last week.
[01:07:13.121 --> 01:07:18.005]  We'll also get into what's happening with the economy, what's happening with inflation, with housing prices.
[01:07:18.025 --> 01:07:24.430]  A lot of key indices coming out today that have come out today on the economy.
[01:07:24.870 --> 01:07:29.294]  You know, I saw this article by Greg Zeminski, wife of POW Navy pilot.
[01:07:29.854 --> 01:07:31.996]  I was actually familiar with her case.
[01:07:32.679 --> 01:07:38.062]  Who had husbands remain sent home by North Vietnamese in 89, was lied to by U.S.
[01:07:38.122 --> 01:07:40.984]  officials for years about his whereabouts and POW status.
[01:07:41.664 --> 01:07:49.629]  Diane Van Rensselaer says she still hasn't gotten the truth about her husband from the military and lawmakers, including Senator John McCain.
[01:07:50.601 --> 01:07:59.583]  Or the Queen of Hearts, who she claims is no friend of POW families and has backstabbed them every step of the way toward getting at the truth.
[01:07:59.603 --> 01:08:00.363]  Now let me just say this.
[01:08:00.383 --> 01:08:04.924]  It's a long article Greg put together, but let me just say this.
[01:08:05.465 --> 01:08:06.585]  It is declassified.
[01:08:06.605 --> 01:08:07.945]  It is quietly admitted.
[01:08:07.965 --> 01:08:09.185]  It is not debatable.
[01:08:10.586 --> 01:08:12.266]  The documents are public.
[01:08:12.706 --> 01:08:15.907]  We're talking major New York newspapers have reported on it.
[01:08:17.447 --> 01:08:19.008]  But there were right under 8,000
[01:08:22.205 --> 01:08:27.827]  American citizens in the Philippines who were there.
[01:08:29.967 --> 01:08:31.888]  Men, women, and children.
[01:08:35.189 --> 01:08:48.593]  And months before they'd intercepted the Japanese communiques, they'd broken their codes years before that, the yellow, the purple, and the blue, and they knew they were going to be taken to the Philippines, and they had to have plans to evacuate the population, and the ships were literally half empty.
[01:08:48.613 --> 01:08:51.834]  They could have masses of personnel and the citizenry get out of there.
[01:08:52.626 --> 01:09:04.772]  And there was a memo put out by Roosevelt where they stated, this will be great anti-Japanese propaganda if they capture not just troops, but women and children.
[01:09:05.512 --> 01:09:12.255]  And so our military, the Navy and the Marines, were ordered to not let them evacuate on government ships.
[01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:15.477]  They were captured.
[01:09:17.126 --> 01:09:20.868]  And over half of them, over 4,000 of them, died in custody.
[01:09:20.888 --> 01:09:33.093]  And I've interviewed people who were seven-year-old little girls and watched their mother being raped, their father having their head cut off, slave labor, you name it, who are now, of course, older women.
[01:09:34.194 --> 01:09:39.276]  I've interviewed people like that who were survivors, just cold-blooded, just for some newsreel propaganda.
[01:09:39.296 --> 01:09:40.176]  7,000-plus people meant nothing.
[01:09:43.191 --> 01:09:50.433]  And then, of course, after World War II, there were all these German prison camps that had over 20,000 U.S.
[01:09:50.833 --> 01:09:51.894]  soldiers on them.
[01:09:51.914 --> 01:09:53.054]  And this is now declassified.
[01:09:53.094 --> 01:09:54.875]  Understand, this isn't debatable.
[01:09:56.635 --> 01:09:57.315]  This is public.
[01:09:59.336 --> 01:10:06.998]  And Stalin wanted them, and our government was making a deal with him, giving him much of Eastern Europe and Central Europe, even though he was killing more people than Hitler.
[01:10:07.599 --> 01:10:08.859]  And they just said, hey, do what you want.
[01:10:08.899 --> 01:10:09.179]  Boom.
[01:10:09.379 --> 01:10:10.219]  No discussion.
[01:10:10.239 --> 01:10:11.700]  People never saw their families again.
[01:10:13.055 --> 01:10:22.377]  And now they've opened up the big GRU and KGB and Commissariat files, and they took them to the Kamchatka Peninsula and many other areas.
[01:10:22.717 --> 01:10:23.857]  They nerve-gassed them.
[01:10:23.877 --> 01:10:30.398]  They tested smallpox on them, anthrax on them, slave labor camps mainly, big old slave mines.
[01:10:32.658 --> 01:10:39.000]  And there were even cases a decade ago where they would even finally just let them go and be retired.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.140]  They'd become basically Russian.
[01:10:41.744 --> 01:10:47.489]  And they'd find, you know, old 80-year-old World War II vets living in Moscow in a little hovel.
[01:10:47.909 --> 01:10:50.472]  All freaked out psychologically, basically mentally ill now.
[01:10:50.492 --> 01:10:52.634]  Just, hey, I don't want to go back to America.
[01:10:52.694 --> 01:10:53.374]  I am Russian.
[01:10:54.135 --> 01:10:56.337]  Yeah, because they'd been 20 years old when they went into the camp.
[01:10:57.758 --> 01:10:59.440]  Our government just, yeah, so what?
[01:10:59.460 --> 01:11:01.762]  They've got 22,000 of them.
[01:11:04.184 --> 01:11:05.545]  Now that's your government, folks.
[01:11:05.765 --> 01:11:06.846]  So it's not our government.
[01:11:06.886 --> 01:11:07.627]  It's out of control.
[01:11:09.008 --> 01:11:15.332]  And of course it's well known that there were troops in slave camps in Vietnam, at least up until the late 80s.
[01:11:15.372 --> 01:11:17.013]  It's well known they worked them to death.
[01:11:17.833 --> 01:11:19.895]  It's well known that they did experiments on them.
[01:11:19.935 --> 01:11:21.495]  It's well known they shipped them to Russia.
[01:11:23.156 --> 01:11:32.902]  I mean, our government paid the equivalent of $50 billion, $3 billion at the time, over 10 years from 1950 to 1960 to radiate 110,000 Jewish children just to test what radiation would do.
[01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:33.883]  They did it to Sephardic Jews.
[01:11:38.775 --> 01:11:41.058]  That's in the major Jewish newspapers over in Israel.
[01:11:41.078 --> 01:11:42.100]  That is not debatable.
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:45.163]  Our government cold-bloodedly killed kids!
[01:11:46.305 --> 01:11:48.087]  So stop being naive out there!
[01:11:49.349 --> 01:11:50.991]  Stop trusting their drinking water.
[01:11:51.031 --> 01:11:52.633]  Stop trusting their propaganda.
[01:11:53.014 --> 01:11:54.616]  Stop trusting everything they tell you.
[01:11:54.636 --> 01:11:55.537]  Stop believing them.
[01:11:56.432 --> 01:12:04.057]  Big, final, finally, big mainstream media reports today about DU and massive birth defects in our troops and Iraqis and serving everybody else.
[01:12:04.337 --> 01:12:05.338]  It's finally starting to break.
[01:12:05.358 --> 01:12:17.766]  Just all the major scientific reports, but I've got mining reports, thanks to listeners, and major federal government bureau mine reports about how DU's totally radioactive and deadly poison back in the 1980s.
[01:12:17.846 --> 01:12:21.008]  It's not like they didn't know this.
[01:12:21.729 --> 01:12:24.971]  My point is, we've got to get our minds around the evil we're facing.
[01:12:27.037 --> 01:12:28.258]  It's hard to deal with.
[01:12:28.318 --> 01:12:31.001]  I mean, the average person doesn't think about killing millions of people.
[01:12:31.401 --> 01:12:33.703]  The average person doesn't think about controlling populations.
[01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:38.067]  The average person's thinking about, man, that breakfast was good this morning, those eggs and sausage.
[01:12:38.427 --> 01:12:39.428]  That's what I'm thinking about.
[01:12:39.448 --> 01:12:42.670]  The average person's thinking about, man, it is a really blue sky day.
[01:12:42.711 --> 01:12:47.835]  I wish I could go play hooky and actually consider it and go fishing or go hang out with my children and my wife.
[01:12:48.914 --> 01:12:58.762]  The average person isn't running around scheming about global domination and how to take over the population, how to dumb people down, how to build urban systems to control populations.
[01:12:59.102 --> 01:13:00.923]  But that's the real world.
[01:13:01.464 --> 01:13:04.006]  They're in control because they do think about that.
[01:13:04.346 --> 01:13:13.193]  And they're in control because we're naive and believe their propaganda and empower their criminal system by being part of their compartmentalized structure.
[01:13:14.404 --> 01:13:16.966]  Well, we're here to shatter the compartmentalization.
[01:13:17.207 --> 01:13:20.069]  We're here to blow past it and shatter it and expose it.
[01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:27.755]  Now, I've interviewed military officers, people who were above McCain, who were in these camps.
[01:13:27.895 --> 01:13:28.616]  He wasn't there.
[01:13:28.676 --> 01:13:29.977]  He'll say he was in one camp.
[01:13:30.097 --> 01:13:31.378]  No one ever saw him there those years.
[01:13:31.858 --> 01:13:33.019]  He'll say he was in another camp.
[01:13:33.039 --> 01:13:38.183]  They'll say, yeah, he was in like a luxury cell some of the time, and he'd be gone for six months a year.
[01:13:39.805 --> 01:13:43.748]  McCain's daddy was the head of the Navy.
[01:13:44.602 --> 01:13:46.524]  He was a very special little goody.
[01:13:47.324 --> 01:13:53.909]  And if you don't think he didn't get sent off to the Soviets, if you don't think he didn't have all that happen, then he's got nothing coming.
[01:13:54.170 --> 01:14:01.275]  McCain's always been a gun-grabbing, un-American, open-border-promoting, cheating-five, scamming criminal.
[01:14:01.735 --> 01:14:04.417]  But of course, the average American knows him as anti-corruption.
[01:14:04.578 --> 01:14:07.300]  Because he's the most corrupt, he'll be known as Mr. Anti-Corruption.
[01:14:09.021 --> 01:14:10.903]  And Diane Van...
[01:14:14.085 --> 01:14:19.087]  Resler just does a great job exposing this in a lot of her sources.
[01:14:19.127 --> 01:14:20.048]  So we're going to have her with us now.
[01:14:20.068 --> 01:14:23.489]  I appreciate her holding for the last five minutes while I ran through here some background.
[01:14:23.529 --> 01:14:28.412]  But frankly, Stalin said, one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[01:14:28.452 --> 01:14:29.732]  Ten thousand dies, it's a statistic.
[01:14:30.072 --> 01:14:42.078]  By focusing in on your husband, maybe it will help people personalize the masses of dead, people's sons that never came back, people's fathers that never came back in World War II, Korea and Vietnam.
[01:14:43.021 --> 01:14:44.922]  And so, Diane, it's good to have you on with us.
[01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:46.082]  Hi, Alex.
[01:14:46.122 --> 01:14:47.123]  Thanks for having me.
[01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:50.384]  Any comments on that five-minute diatribe you just heard?
[01:14:50.544 --> 01:14:51.904]  Do you agree with it, disagree?
[01:14:52.545 --> 01:14:53.005]  Oh, I agree.
[01:14:53.045 --> 01:15:06.190]  I think you presented one of the finest examples of the fact that our leadership considers American citizens, especially military personnel, expendable in pursuit of foreign policy objectives.
[01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.191]  And that's what happened to my husband.
[01:15:09.291 --> 01:15:11.532]  He simply was not worth the price of recovery
[01:15:12.330 --> 01:15:22.534]  After the Department of Defense learned that he was being used as slave labor, along with hundreds of other military pilots in Southeast Asia.
[01:15:23.454 --> 01:15:37.659]  And the Pick and Shovel Brigade, as it was called, by the National Security Agency, was comprised mainly of American pilots who had engineering degrees or experience with engineering.
[01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.479]  And my husband fit into that category.
[01:15:39.859 --> 01:15:41.660]  He was also the youngest pilot in the fleet.
[01:15:42.406 --> 01:15:46.189]  When he left in 1968.
[01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:50.193]  And those communist pieces of trash used him up as a slave.
[01:15:50.873 --> 01:15:58.940]  I think it's a cultural thing for the Vietnamese because they're very small people and most of our guys are big guys.
[01:15:59.501 --> 01:16:07.428]  So for them to exert that kind of physical control over them was necessary and cultural for the Vietnamese.
[01:16:08.137 --> 01:16:23.243]  But the fact that our Department of Defense knew, the Joint Chiefs of Staff were briefed on the fact that these men were being used as slave labor to build a very large underground warehouse north of the demilitarized zone in southern North Vietnam.
[01:16:24.064 --> 01:16:27.585]  We did not even notify our South Vietnamese allies
[01:16:28.124 --> 01:16:29.666]  After the war was allegedly over.
[01:16:29.726 --> 01:16:33.350]  Well, we could have done the men a favor and at least bombed that facility with them in it.
[01:16:33.810 --> 01:16:43.540]  Well, actually, Richard Nixon did lift the bombing controls on areas of Laos, and we had D-52 raids that may very well have killed some of our POWs.
[01:16:44.841 --> 01:16:50.103]  Well, I hate to sound sick, but I think better than leaving them as slaves, might as well kill them and their captors.
[01:16:50.143 --> 01:16:53.044]  I mean, I know you lost your husband, so I apologize if that sounds crass.
[01:16:53.064 --> 01:16:53.924]  Do you agree with that statement?
[01:16:54.384 --> 01:16:55.765]  Well, yes, and actually we did that.
[01:16:55.805 --> 01:17:09.329]  There is a book called Spite House by Monica Jensen Stevenson, and in it, Colonel Tom McKinney, a Marine officer, tells of how he recruited Marine snipers to go in after the war and kill American POWs.
[01:17:10.169 --> 01:17:12.070]  The snipers were told that the men were
[01:17:12.606 --> 01:17:15.988]  Actually, deserters and... Oh, I saw that.
[01:17:16.688 --> 01:17:17.308]  No, that's wrong.
[01:17:17.348 --> 01:17:18.089]  They should save them.
[01:17:18.369 --> 01:17:22.991]  I'm saying if they're in some giant military base and you have no intention of saving them, you might as well.
[01:17:23.031 --> 01:17:25.993]  But again, it shows the war was never even meant to be won.
[01:17:26.753 --> 01:17:29.875]  No, in fact, there was no real objective.
[01:17:30.455 --> 01:17:33.237]  There was no definition of victory in Vietnam.
[01:17:33.477 --> 01:17:35.918]  And my husband and everyone else who died there
[01:17:37.034 --> 01:17:38.374]  Essentially died for nothing.
[01:17:38.434 --> 01:17:40.615]  They died for the good of the American stock market.
[01:17:40.695 --> 01:17:42.155]  They died for corporate America.
[01:17:42.335 --> 01:17:46.176]  Well, the same company, Brown and Root, the subsidiary of Demon Burton.
[01:17:46.956 --> 01:17:48.316]  I don't think anything has changed.
[01:17:48.376 --> 01:17:49.056]  Do you, Alex?
[01:17:50.156 --> 01:17:50.936]  It doesn't change.
[01:17:50.956 --> 01:17:54.817]  But, I mean, how do they just leave these men who totally serve their system?
[01:17:56.617 --> 01:18:00.298]  This has been State Department policy since the beginning of the 20th century.
[01:18:00.678 --> 01:18:05.499]  We had American troops who were left at our gangles during the Russian Revolution.
[01:18:06.434 --> 01:18:13.900]  And General President Eisenhower was briefed on Americans who were captured during Cold War ferret flights.
[01:18:13.940 --> 01:18:16.722]  And we sent in planes to test the Soviet radar defenses.
[01:18:17.163 --> 01:18:24.128]  And when these planes were downed and their crews were captured and the Soviets didn't admit to having them, we didn't negotiate for them.
[01:18:24.148 --> 01:18:27.511]  There were plans to negotiate for several crews, but it never happened.
[01:18:27.871 --> 01:18:29.292]  Because these men are expendable.
[01:18:29.432 --> 01:18:30.333]  That was the decision.
[01:18:30.353 --> 01:18:31.574]  Too embarrassing.
[01:18:33.108 --> 01:18:37.230]  Well, it's like the quote in Paths of Glory about, you know, that's what young men are for, dying.
[01:18:37.250 --> 01:18:45.195]  It's just so, I mean, your husband, you know, fighting for this country, believing what he was doing was right, and then just being shucked off to some slave camp.
[01:18:46.015 --> 01:18:48.136]  I mean, put a bullet in before that happens, folks.
[01:18:48.637 --> 01:18:49.357]  Stay there, Diane.
[01:18:49.377 --> 01:18:50.458]  I really look forward to this interview.
[01:18:50.498 --> 01:18:52.058]  We appreciate your courage in coming on.
[01:18:52.078 --> 01:18:58.462]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[01:18:58.502 --> 01:19:00.243]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:09.290]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:19:09.531 --> 01:19:12.153]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[01:19:12.133 --> 01:19:13.554]  's patented methodology.
[01:19:13.714 --> 01:19:20.621]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[01:19:20.901 --> 01:19:23.904]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:19:24.244 --> 01:19:25.445]  We're good to go.
[01:19:25.705 --> 01:19:26.565]  We're good to go.
[01:19:53.934 --> 01:19:57.215]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:57.255 --> 01:20:01.456]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.696 --> 01:20:04.476]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.676 --> 01:20:07.077]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:07.257 --> 01:20:15.899]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:16.099 --> 01:20:17.459]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:20:17.639 --> 01:20:21.800]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:22.060 --> 01:20:22.580]  We're good to go.
[01:20:41.067 --> 01:20:41.927]  Here it is folks, the 2006 Redbook.
[01:20:42.007 --> 01:20:43.647]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[01:20:43.667 --> 01:20:46.708]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[01:20:46.788 --> 01:20:48.228]  It includes a history of U.S.
[01:20:48.248 --> 01:20:48.568]  coins.
[01:21:07.825 --> 01:21:08.385]  We're good to go.
[01:21:08.405 --> 01:21:08.706]  I think?
[01:21:33.832 --> 01:21:40.059]  That's 1-800-686-2237 Don't be lost in a sea of confusion.
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:42.402]  Get the 2006 Red Book.
[01:21:42.982 --> 01:21:44.844]  Help steer your own financial ship.
[01:21:45.445 --> 01:21:46.266]  Call Midas now.
[01:21:46.286 --> 01:21:46.346]  1-800-686-2237
[01:21:55.151 --> 01:21:56.752]  Government is best which governs least.
[01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:58.613]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:59.053 --> 01:22:01.735]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:02.195 --> 01:22:04.837]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:05.297 --> 01:22:11.761]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:22:12.081 --> 01:22:19.486]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at libertystickers.com.
[01:22:20.046 --> 01:22:21.487]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:22:21.527 --> 01:22:21.727]  Have you?
[01:22:21.747 --> 01:22:22.688]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:22:22.708 --> 01:22:24.710]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:46.348]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:22:46.928 --> 01:22:48.710]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:48.730 --> 01:22:50.872]  All right, we're joined by Diane Van Rensselaer.
[01:23:15.123 --> 01:23:16.204]  I hope I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:23:16.224 --> 01:23:17.364]  I can hardly pronounce my own name.
[01:23:18.465 --> 01:23:23.788]  And we're talking about what happened to her husband, whose body was returned in the late 1980s.
[01:23:23.828 --> 01:23:26.749]  Diane, I mean, let's personalize it.
[01:23:26.769 --> 01:23:36.975]  Let's talk about your husband, what happened to him, and then I want to go through the players who helped ensure that he was never rescued and then tried to cover up what really happened to your husband, please.
[01:23:37.575 --> 01:23:42.098]  Well, Larry Van Rensselaer and I met in high school, Rancho High School, Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:23:43.127 --> 01:23:48.291]  And he became a naval aviation cadet at the worst time in the middle of the war.
[01:23:49.152 --> 01:23:57.218]  And when he was in the training command, the squadron operations officer was, or not squadron, it was the training command at Meridian, Mississippi, was John McCain.
[01:23:58.479 --> 01:24:05.084]  And I had no idea that John McCain would play such a role in my husband and my life later.
[01:24:05.605 --> 01:24:07.666]  But Larry was, he was a great pilot.
[01:24:07.746 --> 01:24:10.248]  Everybody in the squadron thought he was the best.
[01:24:10.328 --> 01:24:11.049]  He was the youngest.
[01:24:11.957 --> 01:24:18.182]  And when Squadron BA-196 deployed in 1968, my husband knew he could be killed.
[01:24:19.062 --> 01:24:20.463]  And he knew he could be captured.
[01:24:20.563 --> 01:24:27.668]  But he never, never, never thought or believed or even considered the fact that he could be abandoned.
[01:24:28.369 --> 01:24:32.812]  But that's what happened to him after he was captured, September the 30th, 1968.
[01:24:33.592 --> 01:24:38.876]  And his crewman, Dominic Spinelli, the oldest man in the squadron, was reported alive in Cambodia in 1993.
[01:24:40.763 --> 01:24:49.007]  And the Spinelli family asked the State Department, Warren Gray in particular, who was going to Cambodia, if he was going to ask the Cambodians about Lieutenant Spinelli.
[01:24:49.707 --> 01:24:50.688]  And they were told no.
[01:24:50.708 --> 01:24:55.390]  That's the attitude in the State Department.
[01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:58.051]  It's just that's ancient history and we're writing them off.
[01:24:58.491 --> 01:25:02.973]  There are overwhelming reports of Americans alive in Southeast Asia.
[01:25:03.373 --> 01:25:08.876]  In fact, the reports are so overwhelming that when Clinton was the president, he signed an executive order preventing Americans
[01:25:09.557 --> 01:25:12.839]  The intelligence gathering on live prisoners in Southeast Asia.
[01:25:13.259 --> 01:25:14.520]  Clinton tried to close the book.
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:21.163]  Carter tried to close the book in 1977 by allowing the Department of Defense to make judgments.
[01:25:21.644 --> 01:25:33.310]  And literally, literally hundreds of police stations have POW MIA flags, but so many, quote, leaders of the POW MIA movement, aren't they just little pimps of the same system?
[01:25:34.398 --> 01:25:35.319]  Not exactly.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:39.803]  There is a family organization that was compromised by the government.
[01:25:39.883 --> 01:25:41.404]  Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:25:42.465 --> 01:25:49.430]  There's lots of people who like to feel good and like to just stick the flag on their car, but they don't really do anything about it.
[01:25:49.450 --> 01:25:55.956]  There is always something that can be done, but it has not proven effective.
[01:25:56.536 --> 01:25:59.659]  We had a Senate Select Committee in 1991 and 1992, which was chaired by Senator John Kerry.
[01:26:04.434 --> 01:26:10.896]  Who has been a traitor to this country and to the men who served in Vietnam and to the men who are serving now.
[01:26:11.276 --> 01:26:17.618]  John Kerry, with the help of other senators like McCain, literally closed the issue down.
[01:26:17.999 --> 01:26:19.719]  We had a good investigation going.
[01:26:19.839 --> 01:26:22.420]  I was on the board of directors of the League of Families at the time.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.041]  And I was back in Washington.
[01:26:24.101 --> 01:26:25.701]  I was in touch with investigators.
[01:26:26.501 --> 01:26:30.743]  And these investigators who were hired were very qualified for the most part.
[01:26:30.803 --> 01:26:32.744]  And they told me that they had...
[01:26:34.582 --> 01:26:40.965]  Evidence that men were left behind and there was evidence that men were still alive.
[01:26:41.786 --> 01:26:53.511]  But there is no resolve on the part of this government to negotiate for them because the policy is these men are considered hostages and we do not negotiate for hostages.
[01:26:53.731 --> 01:26:59.454]  Reagan, Ronald Reagan, was inaugurated in 1981.
[01:26:59.634 --> 01:27:03.336]  The first thing that happened in January, he was offered...
[01:27:04.178 --> 01:27:04.799]  We're good to go.
[01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:05.099]  I think?
[01:27:28.746 --> 01:27:34.589]  Reagan did send in people like Bo Greitz and teams to discover whether or not our prisoners could be rescued.
[01:27:35.409 --> 01:27:36.830]  And it was discovered they could be.
[01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:43.973]  And then it was also determined that it would be very embarrassing and detrimental to military morale to bring these men back at that time.
[01:27:46.354 --> 01:27:50.595]  And so what was done was done covertly.
[01:27:51.136 --> 01:27:56.138]  There is a growing body of evidence that we were forced to accept prisoners back in the mid-'80s.
[01:27:57.153 --> 01:27:59.016]  And these men were called secret returnees.
[01:27:59.056 --> 01:28:05.004]  They were brought back, they were given their pay, and they were not allowed to contact their families.
[01:28:05.745 --> 01:28:12.434]  There's a Special Forces officer who is now resting in Arlington Cemetery, Lieutenant Colonel William Atkins.
[01:28:13.075 --> 01:28:14.257]  He worked with Oliver North.
[01:28:15.629 --> 01:28:16.970]  And he told me the story.
[01:28:17.030 --> 01:28:21.014]  He told his story before to a BBC producer.
[01:28:21.294 --> 01:28:22.635]  Now, stay there.
[01:28:22.655 --> 01:28:24.897]  I want to talk about that, Colonel Atkinson.
[01:28:24.917 --> 01:28:34.444]  Then I want to get into, you confronted George Herbert Walker Bush, and you have been just out there on the front lines, and if we had more men like you, we'd probably be a free country.
[01:28:35.065 --> 01:28:40.109]  But, of course, it's women that are having to stand up and fight this tyranny, and we commend you.
[01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.770]  You're a heroine.
[01:28:40.790 --> 01:28:41.790]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:41.810 --> 01:28:42.211]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.469 --> 01:28:45.410]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.850 --> 01:28:47.471]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.391 --> 01:28:51.193]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.994 --> 01:29:02.518]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:29:02.739 --> 01:29:04.559]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:29:04.760 --> 01:29:05.960]  That's one in four adults.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:09.262]  Because many people have high blood pressure for years without knowing it,
[01:29:09.562 --> 01:29:12.364]  The American Heart Association calls it the silent killer.
[01:29:12.624 --> 01:29:16.307]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we recognize your concern for your well-being.

[01:29:53.863 --> 01:29:55.844]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:55.924 --> 01:30:06.630]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.010 --> 01:30:11.553]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.613 --> 01:30:22.939]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.519 --> 01:30:30.363]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.763 --> 01:30:32.904]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:33.405 --> 01:30:38.367]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.

[01:31:50.413 --> 01:32:01.182]  We'll be talking more with Diane Van Rensselaer about her husband who was left behind and
[01:32:09.521 --> 01:32:12.644]  Used up as a slave of the Vietnamese.
[01:32:14.705 --> 01:32:15.306]  Unbelievable.
[01:32:16.006 --> 01:32:18.929]  But it's just par for the course coming up here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:28.457]  And the story just gets deeper and darker and meshes with all the deep research I've done over the last 10 years plus on this subject and the people I've interviewed.
[01:32:28.477 --> 01:32:32.400]  I mean, I've interviewed folks who've been there, who've seen the POWs.
[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:37.264]  And then it'll quietly be in our news over the last 15, 20 years.
[01:32:37.284 --> 01:32:38.705]  As I said last hour...
[01:32:40.564 --> 01:32:42.985]  Where they found World War II Korean vets.
[01:32:43.205 --> 01:32:49.228]  And they're usually mentally ill, living in some Asian city, totally broken down.
[01:32:49.248 --> 01:32:53.930]  And when they're done with them, I guess they feel sorry for them if they're kind of mentally broken.
[01:32:54.771 --> 01:32:56.051]  It's like some type of pleasure.
[01:32:56.872 --> 01:32:58.753]  And they just kind of release them.
[01:32:59.813 --> 01:33:02.655]  So we've seen this happen, too.
[01:33:03.155 --> 01:33:05.116]  So we'll talk about that more in just a few minutes.
[01:33:06.456 --> 01:33:07.497]  And it's declassified.
[01:33:07.537 --> 01:33:08.037]  It's confirmed.
[01:33:08.057 --> 01:33:09.718]  20-plus thousand.
[01:33:10.425 --> 01:33:11.406]  After World War II.
[01:33:13.527 --> 01:33:15.348]  That they got into German camps.
[01:33:15.688 --> 01:33:18.730]  And Colonel Roberts has been on many times with us to talk about that.
[01:33:18.750 --> 01:33:19.490]  Colonel Craig Roberts.
[01:33:20.711 --> 01:33:22.752]  My friends, it's time to stop being naive.
[01:33:22.792 --> 01:33:26.654]  It's time to admit the nature of the individuals that we're really dealing with here.
[01:33:27.529 --> 01:33:31.853]  And it's time that you get my new film, Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[01:33:32.253 --> 01:33:33.374]  It's a mini-series.
[01:33:33.434 --> 01:33:34.975]  It's a little over three hours long.
[01:33:35.015 --> 01:33:40.499]  It covers the latest police state developments, what happened on 9-11, the motive, who was really behind it.
[01:33:40.519 --> 01:33:54.851]  And then a full hour on the globalist master plan, their ideology, their philosophy, why they see us as cattle, why they see us as slaves, why they actually could care less if we live or die, in fact, even get off on killing us.
[01:33:55.555 --> 01:33:56.396]  You'll understand why.
[01:33:56.416 --> 01:34:01.580]  You'll understand the secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp when you get martial law.
[01:34:02.201 --> 01:34:02.741]  One copy is $24.95.
[01:34:02.801 --> 01:34:04.503]  Two copies are $19.95 apiece.
[01:34:04.683 --> 01:34:07.225]  You can get them down to $14 apiece.
[01:34:07.265 --> 01:34:09.127]  My great film, American Dictators, is $19.95.
[01:34:09.267 --> 01:34:11.329]  Each additional copy is $5.95.
[01:34:12.510 --> 01:34:19.496]  I've got specials right now where you get three of my best DVDs, Road to Tyranny, Martial Law, and American Dictators for $44.95.
[01:34:19.536 --> 01:34:20.276]  That's over a $30 discount.
[01:34:23.418 --> 01:34:26.990]  That's only going until the first of the year.
[01:34:27.030 --> 01:34:28.275]  Just a whole plethora.
[01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.830]  We're good to go.
[01:34:56.033 --> 01:34:56.394]  We're good to go.
[01:34:56.414 --> 01:34:56.654]  I think?
[01:35:12.319 --> 01:35:17.501]  To order via the safe, secure online shopping cart, that's InfoWars.com, or call toll-free.
[01:35:17.521 --> 01:35:20.222]  They can answer all your questions and take your order at 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:20.302 --> 01:35:20.822]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:20.842 --> 01:35:25.704]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:35:42.210 --> 01:35:44.911]  And by the way, that address is just a mail drop-off address, folks.
[01:35:44.931 --> 01:35:46.071]  That's not my physical office.
[01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:51.573]  I'm about to open my physical office up to the public here in the next few weeks.
[01:35:51.633 --> 01:35:52.934]  It's going to be a book and video store.
[01:35:53.434 --> 01:35:55.434]  But when you go to the other address, I'm not there.
[01:35:55.815 --> 01:35:56.755]  Nobody I know is there.
[01:35:56.775 --> 01:35:58.055]  There's a mail drop-off there.
[01:35:58.075 --> 01:36:02.937]  So people at that office are starting to say, man, 15 people a day are coming by here, Alex.
[01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:04.498]  It's getting annoying.
[01:36:04.878 --> 01:36:10.059]  So please don't go over there because they're not going to tell you where I'm at because the bookstore isn't open yet.
[01:36:10.099 --> 01:36:11.760]  And I appreciate you trying to come by and talk to me, but
[01:36:13.566 --> 01:36:14.566]  That's just a side issue.
[01:36:15.007 --> 01:36:17.628]  Another program note for you.
[01:36:18.229 --> 01:36:21.911]  We don't just blast out on the AM and FM dial or the Internet at Infowars.com.
[01:36:22.692 --> 01:36:26.514]  We also go out on Global Shortwave, and during the day it's, what, 9.985?
[01:36:26.574 --> 01:36:29.356]  But at night, the first hour was on 7.465.
[01:36:30.337 --> 01:36:31.397]  Now all three hours are on 5.765.
[01:36:31.437 --> 01:36:31.397]  5.765.
[01:36:31.517 --> 01:36:32.198]  We're getting literally...
[01:36:42.427 --> 01:36:49.592]  Hundreds of calls into the office and into the network as well, respectively, because now they've switched frequencies.
[01:36:50.633 --> 01:36:52.014]  I know they ran announcements.
[01:36:52.054 --> 01:37:05.283]  They did a great job doing that in the past, but maybe they should run announcements in the future because now that we've switched to this frequency, 5.765 at night, 9 to midnight central, a lot of people are trying to find it.
[01:37:05.303 --> 01:37:08.745]  All right, let's go back now to our guest, again, who is joining us.
[01:37:10.044 --> 01:37:12.086]  And we really appreciate her coming on with us.
[01:37:12.966 --> 01:37:34.162]  Diane, continuing with this saga of your husband shot down in 1968, and then let's go through it blow by blow and bring us up to speed, because what you write about, what you talk about with these military witnesses and others about McCain being this double agent, being this traitor, we know he was a prize.
[01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:36.204]  I mean, his daddy was the head of the Navy.
[01:37:37.132 --> 01:37:41.616]  Go through that for us, because that fits into the things he does today.
[01:37:41.676 --> 01:37:46.139]  And he acts like he's for the vets when he's really stabbing them in the back.
[01:37:46.159 --> 01:37:50.082]  It's like he's known for fighting corruption when he's part of the Keating Five.
[01:37:50.122 --> 01:37:50.862]  He's a criminal.
[01:37:51.783 --> 01:37:53.204]  Please break it down for us, Diane.
[01:37:53.744 --> 01:37:54.585]  Oh, I agree with you.
[01:37:54.605 --> 01:37:55.626]  McCain is a criminal.
[01:37:55.646 --> 01:37:59.869]  And what I find most disturbing is that he has presidential aspirations.
[01:38:00.797 --> 01:38:10.660]  And this is a man who was compromised by the North Vietnamese and apparently by the Soviets, the Communists in Eastern Europe during the war.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:13.041]  McCain was captured.
[01:38:14.201 --> 01:38:16.082]  He was shot down over Hanoi.
[01:38:16.122 --> 01:38:18.203]  He had two broken arms when he was captured.
[01:38:19.003 --> 01:38:24.325]  He was given special treatment by the Vietnamese because he told them who he was.
[01:38:25.085 --> 01:38:27.346]  The Vietnamese didn't have to torture John McCain.
[01:38:28.317 --> 01:38:33.378]  In fact, the prisoners of war who returned called him John McDuck because he kept quacking.
[01:38:33.878 --> 01:38:40.860]  He voluntarily gave, he did propaganda broadcasts, he gave interviews with a Spanish journalist.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:46.541]  I understand there is now a text of his interview with a Cuban journalist also.
[01:38:47.221 --> 01:38:56.783]  But McCain was a very, very special prisoner, and one of the highly placed Vietnamese officials named Bui Kint told a veterans group in Texas, he said, we never tortured people.
[01:38:57.068 --> 01:38:57.888]  John McCain.
[01:38:58.289 --> 01:38:59.029]  He was the prince.
[01:38:59.890 --> 01:39:00.950]  McCain was a prize.
[01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:04.632]  He was a propaganda bonanza for the Vietnamese.
[01:39:05.533 --> 01:39:10.896]  And they even have a monument that's built McCain in Hanoi on the shores of the lake in Hanoi where he was...
[01:39:12.188 --> 01:39:13.088]  He was hauled ashore.
[01:39:13.709 --> 01:39:17.330]  But because our government staged that war, and by the way, I've seen photos of that.
[01:39:17.370 --> 01:39:19.091]  Congressional delegations have even visited it.
[01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:20.031]  They're quite proud of it.
[01:39:21.191 --> 01:39:22.232]  They staged the whole deal.
[01:39:22.292 --> 01:39:23.312]  It was never meant to be won.
[01:39:23.372 --> 01:39:24.973]  It was meant to be a big cash bonanza.
[01:39:25.053 --> 01:39:25.833]  I'll say this again.
[01:39:26.413 --> 01:39:32.075]  Do the globalists and the defense contractors make more money if we went to Iraq, got the power on, got a government in and left?
[01:39:32.556 --> 01:39:37.937]  Or do they make more money on defense cells and on the whole war effort if we're there 20 years?
[01:39:38.718 --> 01:39:40.498]  Again, you think they're failing.
[01:39:40.558 --> 01:39:41.899]  No, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:42.671 --> 01:39:43.691]  They're winning.
[01:39:44.252 --> 01:39:44.992]  That's what's happening.
[01:39:45.032 --> 01:39:45.712]  They're winning.
[01:39:46.092 --> 01:39:47.653]  When you think they're losing, they're winning.
[01:39:47.853 --> 01:39:56.855]  When they, quote, lose the war on drugs and quadruple the prison population and there's triple the heroin and double the cocaine on the streets, you go, the more they put in jail, the more drugs there are.
[01:39:56.895 --> 01:39:57.716]  You think they're failing?
[01:39:57.756 --> 01:39:58.076]  Oh, no.
[01:39:58.356 --> 01:40:00.096]  This is how it works, boys and girls.
[01:40:00.136 --> 01:40:00.716]  Please continue.
[01:40:01.577 --> 01:40:12.400]  Well, my concern is that as bad as it is now with the leadership in Washington, having a president like McCain who has been compromised
[01:40:13.137 --> 01:40:19.438]  Well, I've talked to famous, well exactly, I've talked to famous individuals who were in camps that McCain was supposedly in.
[01:40:39.455 --> 01:40:41.215]  And he was never even there at many of the camps.
[01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:42.676]  He would disappear for a year.
[01:40:42.996 --> 01:40:43.876]  Tell folks about that.
[01:40:44.116 --> 01:41:02.081]  Well, according to a CIA file, Colonel Atkins, Lieutenant Colonel William Atkins, who worked with Oliver North, told me that he and Oliver North procured CIA files on the Senators who were going to vote for the Boland Amendment, which would prevent them from supplying aid to the Contras.
[01:41:02.121 --> 01:41:02.981]  This is way back.
[01:41:03.021 --> 01:41:03.921]  We're going back to 1985 now.
[01:41:04.001 --> 01:41:04.061]  And
[01:41:07.463 --> 01:41:11.505]  Colonel Atkins told me that he opened up McCain's CIA file and said, oh, look at this.
[01:41:11.605 --> 01:41:13.985]  He was out of the prison system for a couple of years.
[01:41:14.106 --> 01:41:15.206]  He was in Eastern Europe.
[01:41:15.826 --> 01:41:18.627]  He accepted special favors from the enemy.
[01:41:18.647 --> 01:41:27.070]  He got a vacation where the rest of the men were suffering and being treated like dogs, worse than dogs.
[01:41:27.250 --> 01:41:32.752]  Then, meanwhile, all of the real criminals involved in our encounter go free, but Atkins goes to the hooscow.
[01:41:33.153 --> 01:41:36.794]  Yeah, William Atkins' case is very tragic.
[01:41:37.580 --> 01:41:41.961]  He was a Special Forces officer who was the most decorated captain in the Army.
[01:41:42.521 --> 01:41:43.481]  He was a Navy brat.
[01:41:43.521 --> 01:41:46.562]  His father was a World War II pilot like my father.
[01:41:47.262 --> 01:41:52.082]  And when the war was over, when Liam was a captain, he was ripped.
[01:41:52.363 --> 01:41:53.243]  The Army let him go.
[01:41:53.263 --> 01:41:57.543]  There was no room for people like Liam.
[01:41:57.603 --> 01:42:00.944]  The West Point graduates had to take over the position.
[01:42:01.624 --> 01:42:07.025]  And Liam was left without a cause to fight for him.
[01:42:07.475 --> 01:42:13.338]  He did go to Rhodesia, and he became a Rhodesian citizen and fought against communism there.
[01:42:13.759 --> 01:42:16.180]  And then he came back to the Washington, D.C.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:21.263]  area where he was born, and he worked as a police officer for five years.
[01:42:21.763 --> 01:42:28.387]  But then he discovered that prisoners were left behind after the war.
[01:42:28.507 --> 01:42:35.691]  When Bobby Garwood came home in 1978, William collaborated on a book with the famous writer Robin Moore, who wrote The Green Berets.
[01:42:36.514 --> 01:42:39.355]  And Liam was gathering information in Washington, D.C.
[01:42:39.395 --> 01:42:45.657]  about Garwood and stumbled onto information that hundreds of Americans were known to be alive in Southeast Asia.
[01:42:46.218 --> 01:42:56.821]  When he went to Ann Griffiths, who is the head of the Prisoner of War Families Organization in Washington, and gave her this information, she went to the Department of Defense and confronted them.
[01:42:57.121 --> 01:42:58.882]  And they made her sign a secrecy agreement.
[01:42:58.922 --> 01:43:00.183]  They said they'd tell her the truth.
[01:43:00.823 --> 01:43:04.044]  Essentially what was done was Ann Griffiths was compromised.
[01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:05.461]  We're good.
[01:43:26.064 --> 01:43:28.626]  There was even a resignation in the Prisoner of Affairs office.
[01:43:28.706 --> 01:43:30.447]  Colonel Mike Peck resigned.
[01:43:30.467 --> 01:43:34.530]  He said, I'm not being allowed to do my job.
[01:43:34.570 --> 01:43:36.572]  I can't investigate the live sighting report.
[01:43:37.792 --> 01:43:38.553]  So he resigned.
[01:43:38.573 --> 01:43:42.576]  He said there was a cover-up in the office, and that's when Dick Cheney was the Secretary of Defense.
[01:43:42.796 --> 01:43:44.697]  And Dick Cheney lied to the American public.
[01:43:44.998 --> 01:43:48.100]  He said he investigated Colonel Peck's claims, and that was a lie.
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:48.760]  He never did.
[01:43:49.401 --> 01:43:53.904]  He told Peck's office to be able to respond to Peck's allegations by the end of the day.
[01:43:54.878 --> 01:44:00.099]  So that's why I ran for the Board of Directors, to get in there and try to do something.
[01:44:00.740 --> 01:44:12.343]  My husband's remains had been returned by then, but I believe that we had Senators, Jesse Helms at the time, had an investigative staff, and he said, we're going to have a POW home by Christmas in 1991.
[01:44:12.443 --> 01:44:21.785]  And then all of a sudden, his office was shut down and he was in the hospital, allegedly with prostate cancer surgery.
[01:44:22.662 --> 01:44:36.790]  But when I was on the Board of Directors, I saw firsthand how Department of Defense officials tried to discredit any refugees who had information about live prisoners, how they tried to discredit photographs of live prisoners that were coming out of Southeast Asia.
[01:44:37.751 --> 01:44:44.194]  And Jeff Donahue and I, he's an Air Force brat like I am, his brother Morgan Donahue was left behind in Laos.
[01:44:44.695 --> 01:44:47.076]  Morgan Donahue is an Air Force Academy graduate.
[01:44:47.557 --> 01:44:47.817]  I think so.
[01:45:05.615 --> 01:45:07.636]  Destroyed the whole deal that Perot put together.
[01:45:07.676 --> 01:45:09.776]  And I talked with Ross Perot at that point.
[01:45:09.816 --> 01:45:11.157]  He was returning my phone calls.
[01:45:11.337 --> 01:45:17.499]  Perot then later said that he was, during the presidential run, was threatened to drop out or something would happen to his family.
[01:45:17.559 --> 01:45:23.561]  Yeah, the Texas family, POW families told me that Perot was threatened and that's why he backed off.
[01:45:23.701 --> 01:45:26.341]  I still have much admiration for Perot.
[01:45:26.361 --> 01:45:31.403]  And he was the only presidential candidate that I voted for with a good feeling.
[01:45:31.643 --> 01:45:33.544]  I think Perot could have saved this country.
[01:45:33.644 --> 01:45:34.544]  But unfortunately...
[01:45:35.071 --> 01:45:43.496]  I discovered that there are forces in Washington that are sinister, and they are preventing these men from coming home.
[01:45:43.736 --> 01:45:53.021]  So you think from the evidence there are still Vietnam veterans 30 years later that are in Vietnam, in Cambodia, in Southeast Asia?
[01:45:53.281 --> 01:45:54.762]  The reports are still coming out.
[01:45:55.602 --> 01:46:02.105]  And some of the reports are even linked to specific prisoners, like Tom Hart, Morgan Donahue, Joe Milliner's son.
[01:46:04.231 --> 01:46:05.352]  It's heartbreaking for me.
[01:46:05.372 --> 01:46:07.553]  Now, you confronted George Bush Sr.
[01:46:07.573 --> 01:46:08.294]  Tell folks about that.
[01:46:08.594 --> 01:46:08.994]  Oh, yes.
[01:46:09.094 --> 01:46:14.118]  That was probably an opportunity that Jeff and I just stumbled into.
[01:46:14.178 --> 01:46:20.542]  Our board of directors meeting was in the ballroom of a Washington area hotel.
[01:46:21.182 --> 01:46:24.844]  And our board of directors were assembled on a platform.
[01:46:25.565 --> 01:46:27.126]  And George Bush was our guest speaker.
[01:46:27.746 --> 01:46:33.390]  And as soon as he walked on stage, the family members in the audience below stood up and started screaming and yelling.
[01:46:33.840 --> 01:46:34.581]  No more lies.
[01:46:34.661 --> 01:46:35.461]  Tell us the truth.
[01:46:36.122 --> 01:46:40.246]  And they were clapping their hands and screaming, yelling, no more lies.
[01:46:40.406 --> 01:46:41.527]  Please, no more lies.
[01:46:41.907 --> 01:46:44.229]  So Jeff Donahue and I stood up in solidarity.
[01:46:44.349 --> 01:46:48.873]  The other board members who don't seem to understand the situation sat there.
[01:46:49.454 --> 01:46:56.780]  And Jeff Donahue is tall, like Bush, and I heard Mr. President say to Jeff, are you calling me a liar?
[01:46:57.180 --> 01:47:00.503]  And Jeff turned and said, well, Mr. President, if the shoe fits, wear it.
[01:47:01.104 --> 01:47:01.444]  And Bush
[01:47:01.874 --> 01:47:03.854]  Bush's jaw dropped at that point.
[01:47:04.214 --> 01:47:05.295]  And so I rushed over.
[01:47:05.695 --> 01:47:07.695]  And I said, Mr. President, you know they're there.
[01:47:07.775 --> 01:47:12.116]  I said, Colonel Atkins briefed you on this when you were Vice President.
[01:47:12.636 --> 01:47:14.036]  And his jaw dropped again.
[01:47:15.597 --> 01:47:22.918]  And at that point, the Secret Service people were, they were not coming on the stage because we were on national television.
[01:47:23.218 --> 01:47:27.659]  The C-SPAN cameras had gone to live coverage.
[01:47:28.299 --> 01:47:30.960]  So Jeff and I had Bush for about four and a half minutes.
[01:47:31.240 --> 01:47:31.680]  And Jeff
[01:47:32.515 --> 01:47:39.199]  I said, Mr. President, you need to send a delegation over to negotiate for these prisoners.
[01:47:39.759 --> 01:47:42.080]  And I said, Mr. President, we helped get you elected.
[01:47:42.821 --> 01:47:45.262]  If you bring our prisoners home, we'll help get you reelected.
[01:47:45.282 --> 01:47:52.406]  And at that point, he stepped back, because Jeff was going at him with more foreign and domestic advice.
[01:47:52.906 --> 01:47:59.570]  And Bush took a step backwards, and I was afraid he was going to step off the platform, because there was just a curtain, and then there was the concrete floor below.
[01:47:59.590 --> 01:48:01.311]  So I grabbed his hand and pulled him forward.
[01:48:01.755 --> 01:48:08.637]  Because I had visions of Dan Quayle being president, and I felt that Jeff and I would be blamed for pushing him off the stage.
[01:48:09.357 --> 01:48:11.058]  But Bush was very intimidated.
[01:48:11.158 --> 01:48:14.239]  He was very taken by surprise when I mentioned Colonel Atkins.
[01:48:14.579 --> 01:48:15.459]  It's unbelievable.
[01:48:15.519 --> 01:48:20.860]  I've got actual slaves talking back to me.
[01:48:20.900 --> 01:48:25.062]  Yeah, Jeff and I are both Air Force brats.
[01:48:25.102 --> 01:48:29.823]  My dad was the squadron commander, and Jeff's father commanded the whole base out in the Pacific.
[01:48:30.273 --> 01:48:31.895]  So Jeff and I aren't afraid of anybody.
[01:48:32.335 --> 01:48:34.437]  Jeff has a degree in international economics.
[01:48:35.378 --> 01:48:40.422]  And I was outraged by the fact that they left my husband behind.
[01:48:40.903 --> 01:48:42.164]  And they weren't going to get away with it.
[01:48:43.505 --> 01:48:45.387]  So Jeff and I, we got in our licks.
[01:48:45.647 --> 01:48:46.828]  Wish didn't get re-elected.
[01:48:46.868 --> 01:48:48.089]  He didn't follow our advice.
[01:48:48.309 --> 01:48:51.572]  But what happened as soon as Sheesh Man cut away?
[01:48:51.592 --> 01:48:53.173]  Well, then we...
[01:48:55.615 --> 01:48:56.478]  We all sat down.
[01:48:56.498 --> 01:48:57.602]  I did shut up.
[01:48:57.662 --> 01:49:02.278]  Bush, he did look out in the audience and he said, will you sit down and shut up?
[01:49:02.788 --> 01:49:04.449]  And that's what made front page headlines.
[01:49:05.010 --> 01:49:05.810]  I remember that.
[01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:07.131]  Sit down and shut up.
[01:49:07.371 --> 01:49:09.513]  Yeah, well, I sat down, but I'll never shut up.
[01:49:10.093 --> 01:49:11.534]  And that's been my motto ever since.
[01:49:11.554 --> 01:49:12.355]  Well, that's what they think.
[01:49:12.395 --> 01:49:21.221]  They think that they're God, we're here to serve them and buy all their lives and let their little cokehead sons stumble around and jabber at us.
[01:49:21.542 --> 01:49:22.983]  And I'm just not putting up with it anymore.
[01:49:23.023 --> 01:49:23.563]  What about you?
[01:49:23.983 --> 01:49:31.729]  Well, actually, a few days after that, I met with Senator Bob Perry, and I asked him, I said, if we vote for Clinton, will we bring the POWs back?
[01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:34.070]  Bob Kerry said, oh, he will, he will.
[01:49:34.570 --> 01:49:40.393]  But Bob Kerry sat on that committee, and he helped close it down, just like John McCain.
[01:49:40.593 --> 01:49:42.614]  Bob Kerry was involved in Operation Phoenix.
[01:49:43.574 --> 01:49:44.095]  Yes, he was.
[01:49:44.155 --> 01:49:45.175]  He was a Navy SEAL.
[01:49:45.755 --> 01:49:46.496]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:46.516 --> 01:49:48.156]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:48.176 --> 01:49:48.797]  Torture.
[01:49:54.156 --> 01:50:00.978]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.298 --> 01:50:02.678]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.878 --> 01:50:05.079]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.219 --> 01:50:07.319]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:12.521]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.861 --> 01:50:16.882]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:17.142 --> 01:50:18.923]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:19.003 --> 01:50:29.649]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.790 --> 01:50:31.691]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.891 --> 01:50:35.773]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:50:35.853 --> 01:50:37.274]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:50:53.761 --> 01:50:57.644]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.884 --> 01:51:03.329]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.609 --> 01:51:13.977]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:14.137 --> 01:51:18.481]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.661 --> 01:51:27.005]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:27.285 --> 01:51:33.668]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.768 --> 01:51:38.250]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave them the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:38.470 --> 01:51:42.672]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:51:43.053 --> 01:51:47.335]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:51:47.995 --> 01:51:48.615]  803-4438.
[01:51:49.316 --> 01:51:52.138]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:54.379 --> 01:51:58.842]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:51:59.102 --> 01:52:02.704]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:52:02.824 --> 01:52:10.949]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:52:11.209 --> 01:52:16.853]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:52:17.153 --> 01:52:22.376]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:52:22.657 --> 01:52:24.738]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[01:52:24.998 --> 01:52:37.166]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:52:37.366 --> 01:52:41.809]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:52:42.029 --> 01:52:42.989]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:52:43.149 --> 01:52:44.770]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:46.691]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:52:46.951 --> 01:52:47.412]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:52:47.452 --> 01:52:47.632]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:52:47.652 --> 01:52:49.273]  We're talking to Diane Van Rensselaer.
[01:52:49.293 --> 01:52:49.853]  Lost her husband.
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:13.403]  She got his body back, or his bones back in the late 1980s.
[01:53:14.944 --> 01:53:17.425]  And we're honored to have her on with us.
[01:53:17.445 --> 01:53:19.626]  We're almost out of time for this hour.
[01:53:20.587 --> 01:53:24.949]  We've got a guest coming up just involved in something unspeakable.
[01:53:25.809 --> 01:53:27.350]  But we'll be discussing that.
[01:53:27.390 --> 01:53:28.711]  You'll find out what it is in the next hour.
[01:53:29.585 --> 01:53:33.348]  Diane, I certainly want to get you back up again in the near future.
[01:53:33.388 --> 01:53:34.810]  We've got about four minutes left.
[01:53:34.830 --> 01:53:40.454]  Other key points, other things you want to discuss or talk about or impart to the audience out there?
[01:53:40.995 --> 01:53:43.657]  There are some things that the American public can do.
[01:53:44.278 --> 01:53:48.441]  We have a House resolution that needs sponsorship.
[01:53:48.521 --> 01:53:54.226]  It's House Resolution 123, and it's to form a new committee to investigate the POW abandonment.
[01:53:54.850 --> 01:54:00.796]  And also, there is a film out by the nephew of Roger Dumas, who is left behind in North Korea.
[01:54:01.696 --> 01:54:06.060]  And if they would like a copy of Missing Presumed Dead, they can go to the website.
[01:54:06.241 --> 01:54:11.205]  It's www.missingpresumeddead.com.
[01:54:11.345 --> 01:54:12.006]  Very easy.
[01:54:12.506 --> 01:54:15.970]  And they can order a copy of the DVD, and it is heartbreaking.
[01:54:16.550 --> 01:54:19.393]  There's also a new book out called Is Anybody Listening?
[01:54:19.473 --> 01:54:20.474]  by Barbara Burcham.
[01:54:21.403 --> 01:54:26.585]  And she is the wife of a man who, a special forces officer, who was left behind.
[01:54:26.605 --> 01:54:30.847]  She was told he was dead, and now it looks like there might be evidence that he's still alive.
[01:54:30.907 --> 01:54:32.208]  He could be a secret attorney.
[01:54:33.028 --> 01:54:35.269]  And her book is called Is Anybody Listening?
[01:54:35.809 --> 01:54:38.731]  And you can go to authorhouse.com and order it.
[01:54:38.791 --> 01:54:41.152]  Her name is Barbara Burton, and it's like the tree.
[01:54:41.492 --> 01:54:45.033]  Ron Paul's office called me about this Korean documentary.
[01:54:45.414 --> 01:54:47.354]  Yeah, it's very, very...
[01:54:49.856 --> 01:54:50.716]  Oh, it's awesome.
[01:54:51.377 --> 01:54:52.677]  It's the best I've ever seen.
[01:54:52.757 --> 01:54:57.779]  I've seen a few films made about the POW abandonment, but Bill has done a remarkable job.
[01:54:58.139 --> 01:55:03.821]  Senator Bob Smith is one of the key people who's interviewed.
[01:55:03.861 --> 01:55:04.601]  Now, Bob Smith
[01:55:05.382 --> 01:55:09.865]  Was a congressman from New Hampshire who became a senator, and he was the co-chair of the Senate.
[01:55:09.885 --> 01:55:10.986]  No, no, I've met Bob.
[01:55:11.006 --> 01:55:17.130]  I've actually had him down to Austin to speak, and then the Republicans came after him after he didn't properly grovel to them.
[01:55:17.530 --> 01:55:18.471]  Well, Bob's a hero.
[01:55:18.531 --> 01:55:21.072]  He knew he was outgunned by John Kerry, who was an attorney.
[01:55:21.353 --> 01:55:24.094]  But when I was on the board of directors, Bob Smith encouraged me.
[01:55:24.114 --> 01:55:26.776]  He said, well, you and Jeff Donahue are a minority.
[01:55:26.916 --> 01:55:28.537]  And he said, so am I in this committee.
[01:55:29.058 --> 01:55:31.379]  But he said, you're inside the tent, and you're a witness.
[01:55:31.499 --> 01:55:33.200]  And I think that's what we all are, Alex.
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:33.981]  We're witnesses.
[01:55:34.608 --> 01:55:46.200]  We have witnessed a policy by our leaders in Washington, a policy that continues to exist in Southwest Asia.
[01:55:46.701 --> 01:55:48.503]  Our prisoners are going to be abandoned.
[01:55:48.563 --> 01:55:53.348]  Our military personnel are expendable in pursuit of foreign policy objectives.
[01:55:53.428 --> 01:55:56.151]  And anyone who goes in the military now is
[01:55:56.581 --> 01:56:00.684]  Well, the key here is that this goes to the mentality of those controlling things.
[01:56:07.657 --> 01:56:09.579]  We have the Army manuals from the 80s.
[01:56:09.659 --> 01:56:12.001]  We have the Department of Energy manuals from the 70s.
[01:56:12.041 --> 01:56:13.843]  We have reports in the 50s.
[01:56:13.883 --> 01:56:15.224]  We have them from the early 90s.
[01:56:15.245 --> 01:56:17.086]  We have the head of the DU program on.
[01:56:17.507 --> 01:56:23.953]  DU is deadly poison and radioactive, and it just devastates the troops, causes massive birth defects.
[01:56:23.993 --> 01:56:25.454]  I mean, it is ultra bad.
[01:56:26.135 --> 01:56:29.018]  And the government, even back in the first Gulf War 15 years ago,
[01:56:30.919 --> 01:56:32.900]  They said, you've got to use protective gear.
[01:56:32.940 --> 01:56:34.540]  Now they just say, no, it's good for you.
[01:56:35.020 --> 01:56:37.441]  Just breathe it, snort it, roll in it.
[01:56:37.861 --> 01:56:42.862]  I mean, it just shows that... How does the elite get away with this?
[01:56:43.162 --> 01:56:45.823]  Because of our national press.
[01:56:46.363 --> 01:56:54.204]  There is no resolve on the part of our national press, which is controlled by corporations, to tell us the truth about our leaders and the policy in this country.
[01:56:54.225 --> 01:56:56.645]  And I think that's a tragedy.
[01:56:56.685 --> 01:57:00.366]  Until the national press goes after John McCain and exposes him for what he is...
[01:57:01.789 --> 01:57:02.269]  A weasel.
[01:57:03.190 --> 01:57:04.510]  No, I'm insulting the weasels.
[01:57:04.610 --> 01:57:05.050]  I'm sorry.
[01:57:05.350 --> 01:57:11.512]  John McCain is not a leader, and he is unfit to be president.
[01:57:11.552 --> 01:57:13.773]  No, he really is a punk weasel.
[01:57:14.613 --> 01:57:17.654]  And there's nothing worse than being a cowardly piece of trash.
[01:57:17.974 --> 01:57:18.654]  He is a coward.
[01:57:19.434 --> 01:57:22.895]  And then acting like he's comparing himself with these other great men.
[01:57:23.215 --> 01:57:25.756]  Listen, I want to thank you, Diane, for coming on, and God bless you.
[01:57:25.776 --> 01:57:26.916]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[01:57:27.216 --> 01:57:27.556]  You bet.
[01:57:27.576 --> 01:57:28.077]  Take care.
[01:57:28.777 --> 01:57:29.317]  Oh, Diane?
[01:57:30.231 --> 01:57:32.032]  I forgot to ask her one more question.
[01:57:32.052 --> 01:57:33.173]  I'll be back if you want me to.
[01:57:33.193 --> 01:57:33.673]  Yep, stay there.
[01:57:34.174 --> 01:57:38.076]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:38.397 --> 01:57:39.197]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.151 --> 01:57:50.811]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.472 --> 01:57:52.512]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.233 --> 01:57:54.353]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.994 --> 01:57:55.814]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.555 --> 01:57:57.455]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.475 --> 01:58:02.058]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.318 --> 01:58:06.440]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.063 --> 01:58:16.726]  We have a very interesting surprise guest coming up in about eight minutes when we start the second segment, but
[01:58:18.817 --> 01:58:29.860]  We've been talking to Diane Van Rensselaer in the last hour about leaving POWs behind, and all the cover-ups, all the subterfuge has been involved in that.
[01:58:29.920 --> 01:58:31.301]  Diane, I'm sorry I'm holding you over.
[01:58:31.561 --> 01:58:37.322]  I know you're busy, but I forgot to ask you about any websites or any places that we should go check out.
[01:58:38.022 --> 01:58:46.985]  Well, the website that I mentioned was to get a copy of Bill Dumas' film, www.missingpresenteddead.
[01:58:47.981 --> 01:58:49.902]  There are a number of websites.
[01:58:49.962 --> 01:58:56.266]  The National Alliance of Families has a website where people can go for information and updates on what's happening.
[01:58:56.706 --> 01:59:01.569]  But unfortunately, this administration is not really following up.
[01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:08.594]  The live sighting reports are pretty much ignored now, thanks to President Clinton.
[01:59:09.554 --> 01:59:17.099]  And the House Resolution 123 is the most important thing that people can do at this point to press for an accounting report.
[01:59:18.294 --> 01:59:28.839]  But also, we didn't get into the subject about the Vietnamese community here in the Bay Area and what they know about McCain.
[01:59:29.240 --> 01:59:45.728]  I have a friend who's very highly placed in the Vietnamese community, and McCain had a very special nurse when he was recovering from his injuries, and the rumor in the community has been for many years that he has a son by Nguyen Thanh Cam's sister, who is his nurse.
[01:59:46.554 --> 01:59:49.957]  And the son allegedly went to school at the University of Colorado.
[01:59:50.277 --> 01:59:54.580]  The mainstream press could track down this rumor in a couple of days and let us know if it's true.
[01:59:54.680 --> 02:00:14.816]  I don't know if it's true or not, but when the Bush administration or the Bush campaign people made allegations about McCain having an adopted black son or daughter and making allegations that the child was actually his, I think that they were poking McCain, letting him know that they know about his...
[02:00:15.717 --> 02:00:18.038]  His illegitimate Vietnamese child, his son.
[02:00:18.938 --> 02:00:22.039]  And this is something I wish the mainstream press would go after.
[02:00:22.099 --> 02:00:23.619]  Let's find out if it's true or not.
[02:00:24.239 --> 02:00:25.800]  I have a feeling that it is true.
[02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:30.241]  And I met with another Vietnamese who was involved with the community.
[02:00:30.281 --> 02:00:32.862]  We had a big vet-to-vet convention in San Jose.
[02:00:33.442 --> 02:00:37.483]  And he told me that McCain actually has two sons by Nguyen Phan Cam's sister.
[02:00:38.323 --> 02:00:42.445]  So that gives us something even more to go on.
[02:00:42.465 --> 02:00:43.725]  Let's track down both of them.
[02:00:44.661 --> 02:00:50.304]  I really don't know if this is true, but he did bring General Quang over to California in 1993.
[02:00:51.445 --> 02:00:56.107]  And General Quang brought a film crew and made a propaganda film using American veterans in Santa Cruz.
[02:00:56.127 --> 02:00:58.628]  I have a copy of it, and it's humiliating.
[02:00:59.589 --> 02:01:01.810]  And this was all done with the help of John McCain.
[02:01:01.930 --> 02:01:03.851]  The man is being blackmailed into doing this.
[02:01:04.071 --> 02:01:05.972]  It's obvious.
[02:01:06.872 --> 02:01:12.815]  And if he continues in politics, or if he is indeed the President of the United States,
[02:01:13.123 --> 02:01:15.864]  He's so compromised, he can be blackmailed into doing anything.
[02:01:16.685 --> 02:01:18.485]  And it's a very dangerous situation.
[02:01:18.506 --> 02:01:20.727]  I want the press to go after this.
[02:01:21.647 --> 02:01:23.548]  I don't care, mainstream press, anybody.
[02:01:23.988 --> 02:01:25.529]  Crack down this rumor, please.
[02:01:26.789 --> 02:01:29.250]  Expose John McCain for what he really is.
[02:01:30.871 --> 02:01:32.212]  He's no good for this country.
[02:01:32.372 --> 02:01:33.753]  Let's send him back to Vietnam.
[02:01:33.773 --> 02:01:34.573]  They love him there.
[02:01:36.514 --> 02:01:37.074]  Absolutely.
[02:01:37.134 --> 02:01:38.815]  I want to thank you for coming on with us.
[02:01:39.697 --> 02:01:41.638]  And I look forward to talking to you in the near future, Diane.
[02:01:42.159 --> 02:01:44.020]  I sat down, but I'll never shut up, Alex.
[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:45.781]  You know, we can't do that.
[02:01:45.801 --> 02:01:51.364]  If we think things are bad right now, what would happen if we weren't here?
[02:01:51.724 --> 02:01:55.726]  If people like yourself weren't out there exposing what's happening?
[02:01:55.746 --> 02:01:56.907]  So Godspeed and take care.
[02:01:57.167 --> 02:01:59.088]  The truth will set us free.
[02:01:59.688 --> 02:02:00.749]  It will, and it is.
[02:02:00.809 --> 02:02:02.230]  People are waking up like never before.
[02:02:02.290 --> 02:02:02.630]  Take care.
[02:02:04.231 --> 02:02:08.714]  Now, folks, when I read this story, I really struggled with...
[02:02:10.869 --> 02:02:12.410]  Should I have this individual on?
[02:02:14.411 --> 02:02:16.812]  And we're going to have them on.
[02:02:18.933 --> 02:02:23.755]  And I literally may have to have a vomit bag with me while I do it.
[02:02:25.116 --> 02:02:27.697]  But we'll tell you about it when we get back after this quick break.
[02:02:27.737 --> 02:02:32.500]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.net.
[02:02:32.540 --> 02:02:35.201]  Stay with us as we delve into evil.
[02:02:36.001 --> 02:02:36.902]  As we expose it.
[02:02:37.961 --> 02:02:41.423]  We have to show the well-meaning saps out there what they're facing.
[02:02:41.483 --> 02:02:42.544]  Stop being naive.
[02:02:43.064 --> 02:02:43.705]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.906 --> 02:02:49.768]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:50.028 --> 02:02:50.709]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.809 --> 02:02:51.589]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.950 --> 02:02:56.612]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.953 --> 02:03:01.395]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.815 --> 02:03:05.978]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.198 --> 02:03:09.060]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.140 --> 02:03:13.803]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:14.004 --> 02:03:18.447]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.647 --> 02:03:25.872]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.112 --> 02:03:28.534]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.694 --> 02:03:30.455]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:56.117 --> 02:04:07.345]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.666 --> 02:04:13.390]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.630 --> 02:04:20.273]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.493 --> 02:04:27.296]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[02:04:46.821 --> 02:04:48.422]  Government is best which governs least.
[02:04:48.982 --> 02:04:50.283]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:04:50.724 --> 02:04:53.425]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:04:53.886 --> 02:04:56.527]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:04:56.968 --> 02:05:03.432]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:05:50.339 --> 02:05:50.979]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.640 --> 02:05:52.700]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.401 --> 02:05:54.621]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.161 --> 02:05:56.002]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.742 --> 02:05:57.603]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.323 --> 02:06:02.285]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.485 --> 02:06:06.627]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.848 --> 02:06:10.629]  It's a complex issue.
[02:06:10.949 --> 02:06:12.510]  It's like a Rubik's Cube.
[02:06:13.951 --> 02:06:16.272]  A lot of different factors involved.
[02:06:17.172 --> 02:06:18.153]  We're going to be talking to...
[02:06:19.082 --> 02:06:24.024]  Joanne Page, I believe the director of the Fortune Society.
[02:06:24.044 --> 02:06:26.724]  I'll tell you about that here in just a few minutes.
[02:06:27.585 --> 02:06:31.886]  But here's the headline, and this is out of Reuters today.
[02:06:32.446 --> 02:06:35.787]  Serial killer art raises free speech debate.
[02:06:36.567 --> 02:06:39.148]  An online auction of artwork by a serial killer.
[02:06:39.873 --> 02:06:56.207]  Triggered outrage in Massachusetts on Tuesday where lawmakers proposed to block criminals from profiting from what they called murderabilia, I guess, or memorabilia, murderabilia, setting off a debate on free speech rights of prisoners.
[02:06:57.825 --> 02:07:15.352]  A colored pencil sketch of Jesus Christ kneeling in a desert by Alfred Gaynor, a serial killer serving four life sentences for sodomizing and choking to death, four women went on sale Tuesday on a website operated by a prisoner advocacy group.
[02:07:16.249 --> 02:07:22.113]  It was one of nearly 300 artworks offered for auction through December 18th on the Fortune Society's website.
[02:07:22.193 --> 02:07:29.777]  If sold, nearly all proceeds will, from the work entitled A Righteous Man's Reward, will go to Gaynor, the group said.
[02:07:31.298 --> 02:07:42.085]  And it says, a protest from the families of Gaynor's victims, can you imagine, about the possibility of a convicted murderer profiting from his criminal celebrity, prompted State Rep.
[02:07:42.185 --> 02:07:42.565]  Peter Kuhn,
[02:07:44.657 --> 02:07:51.180]  A Democrat, I think I'm pronouncing that right, to submit a new variation of the Son of Sam law in the state legislature.
[02:07:51.980 --> 02:07:57.023]  But the legislative proposal triggered its own debate over the prisoner's constitutional right of free speech.
[02:07:58.123 --> 02:08:12.971]  And it says Marjorie Hens, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, said freedom of expression extends to prisoners even if it causes emotional distress or offense to the victim's family.
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:28.263]  And it goes on, the artwork of America's most notorious killers, ranging from pencil drawings by Charles Manson to a painting of executed serial killer John Wayne Gacy, the clown, fetch hefty sums from collectors of murderabilia.
[02:08:29.803 --> 02:08:38.405]  And we've taught in society that crime doesn't pay, but here we are allowing crime to pay, and it's sending the wrong message to people, said the former prosecutor.
[02:08:38.445 --> 02:08:43.386]  Now, we're going to let you hear the other side of this, but before we get our guests, I've got to say this right now.
[02:08:44.735 --> 02:08:45.755]  You know, this is what they do.
[02:08:45.775 --> 02:08:52.738]  You got Nazis out there saying, kill all the black people, and so they say, okay, let's ban free speech because the Nazis have it.
[02:08:53.798 --> 02:08:59.980]  Well, no, you can't ban their free speech, because then you'll lose your free speech to criticize and protest the Nazis.
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:04.221]  It's the same thing with this black professor saying, kill every white person, because we're devil seed.
[02:09:06.002 --> 02:09:09.903]  If he tries to act on that, or he gets specific about who to kill, then he can get in trouble.
[02:09:09.923 --> 02:09:13.304]  But if he's just saying, we should wipe them off the face of the earth, well, then you should go arrest...
[02:09:15.392 --> 02:09:20.975]  People like Paul Harvey, who says black slavery was good, and we should nuke all the Arabs, and killing the Indians was good.
[02:09:21.035 --> 02:09:21.615]  Ha, ha, ha.
[02:09:21.635 --> 02:09:23.055]  I mean, we've played the clipper.
[02:09:23.075 --> 02:09:24.256]  We can play it again if you don't believe us.
[02:09:25.757 --> 02:09:27.577]  No, I have a right to decry all this.
[02:09:27.617 --> 02:09:37.521]  The problem is there's moves, and the very crowds that will say, hey, let's let these convicted killers make money off this, they're the very people that are going, we need a hate crime law, because you hurt somebody's feelings.
[02:09:38.422 --> 02:09:41.123]  So, you know, when I hear about free speech, I say,
[02:09:43.448 --> 02:09:46.431]  I think, yeah, people do need free speech, but here's the problem.
[02:09:47.472 --> 02:09:58.663]  If somebody writes a poem, or somebody from prison writes a book, and he can get a publisher for the book, and it isn't about the crime they committed, then I think that's free speech.
[02:09:58.683 --> 02:10:06.370]  I mean, if I go to prison for some trumped-up charge, because I'm a political prisoner, I should be able to write a book, have it published outside, and have that proceeds go to my family.
[02:10:07.659 --> 02:10:18.117]  But if I start running around making money directly off the crime, which then they'll argue, well, you're making money off the crime because you are famous because you're in there.
[02:10:18.820 --> 02:10:23.762]  And because of the crime you committed, then they can say, even if it isn't about the crime, you can't make money.
[02:10:24.362 --> 02:10:36.766]  But, I mean, there's got to be a point here, folks, because I don't think prisoners should be stopped from being able to write, being able to lecture, and being able to get information out, because about half the people in prison really are innocent and shouldn't be there.
[02:10:36.926 --> 02:10:37.946]  I'm serious, folks.
[02:10:38.812 --> 02:10:42.974]  I mean, now with the DNA, it's showing around a third of rapes and murders are totally innocent.
[02:10:43.394 --> 02:10:48.036]  See, I'm for the death penalty, except we have our government so corrupt and so untrustworthy that we can't trust them.
[02:10:48.076 --> 02:10:53.899]  They're so much more criminal than the average criminal that they can't be trusted to dispense it.
[02:10:54.619 --> 02:10:59.661]  But bags of pus, like this individual that murdered these four women, no.
[02:10:59.681 --> 02:11:01.882]  You know, there should be some taste here.
[02:11:02.743 --> 02:11:06.904]  And this organization, the Fortune Society, should have that taste.
[02:11:07.505 --> 02:11:10.086]  And, you know, sure, they got their free speech.
[02:11:10.526 --> 02:11:14.107]  But this free speech debate wouldn't even have come up if they weren't doing this.
[02:11:14.327 --> 02:11:17.468]  And now we wouldn't be in danger of prisoners losing their free speech.
[02:11:17.488 --> 02:11:22.270]  So it's distasteful, it's disgusting, and it makes me want to vomit all over this microphone.
[02:11:22.790 --> 02:11:25.791]  And so that's what I have to say to our guests, who I appreciate having the courage to come on.
[02:11:26.391 --> 02:11:28.492]  Joanne Page, you're with the Fortune Society.
[02:11:29.152 --> 02:11:30.332]  You can respond to that if you'd like.
[02:11:30.793 --> 02:11:31.073]  Sure.
[02:11:31.113 --> 02:11:31.933]  Well, you said a lot.
[02:11:32.813 --> 02:11:34.474]  I agree with you about the free speech issue.
[02:11:34.874 --> 02:11:42.979]  I think that what we've got is, in our country right now, we lock up a higher percentage of our population and a greater number of people than anywhere else in the world.
[02:11:43.319 --> 02:11:47.161]  And you've got people who are in there for doing terrible crimes and people who did nothing.
[02:11:47.261 --> 02:11:49.142]  Yeah, we're 4% of the population.
[02:11:49.202 --> 02:11:50.963]  We've got 25% of the world's prison population.
[02:11:51.163 --> 02:11:54.305]  Yeah, and that's not something to be proud of in a country that talks about liberty.
[02:11:54.986 --> 02:12:00.689]  Yeah, but we know that scumbags like the serial killer torturing women, that guy needs to be dead.
[02:12:00.709 --> 02:12:01.970]  He doesn't need to be making money.
[02:12:02.530 --> 02:12:03.351]  Well, you know something?
[02:12:03.371 --> 02:12:05.652]  He has gotten four consecutive life sentences.
[02:12:06.152 --> 02:12:06.933]  He's been punished.
[02:12:06.973 --> 02:12:08.234]  He's not ever getting out.
[02:12:08.794 --> 02:12:10.935]  And I think that you have a couple of different things happening.
[02:12:11.255 --> 02:12:12.116]  You've got the crime.
[02:12:12.316 --> 02:12:13.257]  You've got the punishment.
[02:12:13.837 --> 02:12:14.958]  Those are happening.
[02:12:15.178 --> 02:12:16.819]  I would not argue with the punishment.
[02:12:17.259 --> 02:12:22.622]  You've got a situation where terrible damage was done eight years ago, and this man will be in prison for the rest of his life.
[02:12:23.359 --> 02:12:33.325]  But that doesn't mean that he can't write, that he can't draw a picture and get it out there, that he doesn't have rights under the Constitution that are different than his rights to walk out.
[02:12:33.605 --> 02:12:35.006]  He's never going to see the street.
[02:12:35.046 --> 02:12:36.147]  I really think that if it's murder...
[02:12:38.778 --> 02:12:41.660]  And obviously, folks, free speech means you need to be able to make money off of it.
[02:12:41.680 --> 02:12:45.523]  Just putting something out, people can't pay to get it out to folks if it doesn't make money.
[02:12:45.663 --> 02:12:47.464]  I understand that equation.
[02:12:47.484 --> 02:12:50.827]  People write me letters saying I should make my videos and give them out for free.
[02:12:51.187 --> 02:12:53.909]  Well, I could even make the videos if I didn't sell them, folks.
[02:12:53.929 --> 02:12:55.871]  I mean, that's just how a free market works.
[02:12:56.950 --> 02:13:05.712]  We have to find a balance here, and really, I think you're going to end up losing your right to even sell anybody's pictures by going out, and there should be some self-enforcement.
[02:13:05.952 --> 02:13:12.574]  There's the letter of the law and the spirit of the law, and I don't think you guys should, I think you should selectively, you can decide.
[02:13:12.794 --> 02:13:13.794]  That's not censorship.
[02:13:14.034 --> 02:13:17.795]  Censorship is if you go to try and stop them from getting out their work.
[02:13:18.155 --> 02:13:26.217]  But it is selective, simple pruning to not take any type of evil you can imagine.
[02:13:26.557 --> 02:13:27.938]  Well, here's where we draw our line.
[02:13:28.238 --> 02:13:34.640]  We would take a picture that we consider destructive or violent or connected to a person's crime.
[02:13:35.081 --> 02:13:42.184]  But what we do, and we've been doing this for years, is any prisoner who gets released, who walks in our doors, gets help, gets services.
[02:13:42.324 --> 02:13:46.645]  Because if people get help and don't do new crimes, everybody benefits.
[02:13:46.986 --> 02:13:48.886]  We use the same philosophy with our art show.
[02:13:49.287 --> 02:13:50.347]  We put a word out there.
[02:13:50.647 --> 02:13:52.348]  We got entries from over 30 states.
[02:13:53.678 --> 02:14:01.345]  What we do essentially is we say if you want to share the art that you've done and try to get some money for it, and the money is very limited.
[02:14:01.385 --> 02:14:02.506]  We start them at $15.
[02:14:03.467 --> 02:14:05.529]  We've capped this category of pictures at $250.
[02:14:06.490 --> 02:14:07.752]  Nobody's going to get rich off this.
[02:14:08.252 --> 02:14:11.495]  But we would not say to a person, what crime were you convicted of?
[02:14:11.876 --> 02:14:15.179]  Because we're not going to get into the story of what the crime was
[02:14:15.871 --> 02:14:22.559]  Whether the person was guilty or not, you're seeing people right now... But I'm sure you know that the art dealers who buy these walk right out the door and sell them for $20,000.
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:27.125]  You know, something they also could communicate directly with him and get pictures of them and sell them for $20,000.
[02:14:28.026 --> 02:14:32.391]  We can control what we do, and what we do is take prisoners from around the country...
[02:14:33.593 --> 02:14:37.675]  Who are working on rehabilitating themselves through art and let them have a forum for their art.
[02:14:37.715 --> 02:14:39.456]  Listen, we have to consciously talk about this.
[02:14:39.596 --> 02:14:46.479]  Obviously, I don't want... I mean, it's better that ten guilty men go free than one man who's innocent.
[02:14:47.019 --> 02:14:49.140]  We're some of the few people who believe that then, Alex.
[02:14:49.540 --> 02:14:51.560]  The laws have changed tremendously around that.
[02:14:51.600 --> 02:14:52.140]  I agree with you.
[02:14:52.301 --> 02:14:58.542]  I know, but I'm telling you, somebody who brutally sodomizes and murders women brutally... He did it for the rest of his life.
[02:14:58.682 --> 02:14:59.162]  I don't care.
[02:14:59.202 --> 02:15:04.323]  Listen, I'm telling you, I think some of what you do is admirable.
[02:15:04.683 --> 02:15:15.685]  But I'm telling you, by doing this, you're going to end up losing and letting control freaks get in there and use this as a poster child, pun intended, to restrict free speech.
[02:15:15.725 --> 02:15:16.225]  Just watch.
[02:15:16.946 --> 02:15:19.028]  I'm afraid you're right, and I'm not happy about it.
[02:15:19.328 --> 02:15:25.553]  But I think that if the alternative is not to let any prisoners get their art out, that allows the alternative.
[02:15:25.613 --> 02:15:27.494]  I'm just saying, you know what?
[02:15:28.014 --> 02:15:28.995]  They don't control you.
[02:15:29.035 --> 02:15:30.316]  These prisoners don't control you.
[02:15:30.336 --> 02:15:35.200]  You don't have to take it from murdering clowns and just literal demons.
[02:15:35.220 --> 02:15:39.123]  You don't have to have communiques with actual pit-of-hell creatures.
[02:15:39.143 --> 02:15:42.065]  See, we don't ask a person what they're convicted of.
[02:15:42.446 --> 02:15:45.548]  And we don't go into the nature of the conviction or whether the convictions are...
[02:15:46.232 --> 02:15:46.632]  Correct.
[02:15:46.912 --> 02:15:57.115]  What we simply do once a year is we let prisoners who are interested in art and who do pictures get a chance to exhibit them and get them out there.
[02:15:57.576 --> 02:15:59.296]  And that's all we do in terms of the art.
[02:15:59.516 --> 02:16:04.718]  What we do in our counseling, what we do in our work directly with clients, is we work on accountability.
[02:16:04.998 --> 02:16:06.959]  We work on teaching people how to hold a job.
[02:16:07.059 --> 02:16:12.920]  Well that's good, but the press is trying to frame this that you guys make more than just a pittance on it.
[02:16:13.160 --> 02:16:14.621]  Well here's what's funny about it, right?
[02:16:15.117 --> 02:16:21.021]  First of all, if the press had not gotten involved in this, this picture probably would have gone for $30, $40, $50.
[02:16:22.782 --> 02:16:33.228]  Because of what the press has done, there's been all this talk about lots of money, and there may be people who approach him to try to sell pictures at much higher prices than the $250 we're capping it at.
[02:16:33.609 --> 02:16:35.010]  We don't take a penny out of this.
[02:16:35.730 --> 02:16:37.411]  What we do is we do this as a service.
[02:16:37.811 --> 02:16:41.814]  Because part of what our job is, is to say that there are people behind bars.
[02:16:42.403 --> 02:16:44.224]  There are people who may have done bad things.
[02:16:44.264 --> 02:16:45.525]  There are people who may have done nothing.
[02:16:45.586 --> 02:16:53.892]  And so your argument is that instead of getting involved in picking and choosing, you guys are just totally equal opportunity to everybody.
[02:16:54.012 --> 02:16:55.533]  Well, we do it on the merit of the picture.
[02:16:56.054 --> 02:16:58.456]  If we think it's something destructive, we don't use it.
[02:16:58.836 --> 02:17:02.339]  If we think it's something that shows some talent and creativity, we do.
[02:17:02.719 --> 02:17:03.099]  That's it.
[02:17:03.760 --> 02:17:11.746]  And the punishment, what you should have in any system is you should have crime prevention, you should have punishment, and you should have rehabilitation.
[02:17:12.321 --> 02:17:14.022]  Punishment happens in these cases.
[02:17:14.482 --> 02:17:18.083]  What we consider art to be a form of is rehabilitation.
[02:17:18.704 --> 02:17:25.106]  If somebody earns a bit of money on it and they can use it for commissary or use it for art supplies, we're glad to see that happen.
[02:17:25.466 --> 02:17:32.089]  Because counseling has gone down in prisons, drug treatment has gone down, college has vanished, art programs aren't there.
[02:17:32.569 --> 02:17:33.309]  What does somebody do?
[02:17:33.329 --> 02:17:37.511]  I'll tell you what, let's talk about this for a couple more minutes on the other side if you can, Joanne.
[02:17:38.391 --> 02:17:41.273]  I'll tell you, this is really, there are a few things that confuse me.
[02:17:41.293 --> 02:17:42.033]  This is one of them.
[02:17:46.295 --> 02:17:50.177]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:17:50.318 --> 02:17:52.079]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[02:17:52.139 --> 02:17:53.399]  But not just any water.
[02:17:53.499 --> 02:17:57.702]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[02:17:57.762 --> 02:18:07.468]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients and most importantly supports the immune system.
[02:18:07.688 --> 02:18:08.249]  We're good to go.
[02:18:22.765 --> 02:18:25.267]  And for more information, visit rpa-biotech.com or call 1-866-884-9104.
[02:18:25.327 --> 02:18:25.628]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[02:18:45.953 --> 02:18:47.273]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:18:47.334 --> 02:18:52.455]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:19:05.908 --> 02:19:06.529]  We're good to go.
[02:19:29.821 --> 02:19:30.082]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.737 --> 02:19:51.039]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[02:19:51.239 --> 02:19:53.300]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[02:19:53.540 --> 02:20:00.662]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:20:00.782 --> 02:20:12.306]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[02:20:12.646 --> 02:20:13.427]  We're good to go.
[02:20:43.466 --> 02:20:44.587]  888-803-4438.
[02:20:46.828 --> 02:20:50.129]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[02:20:50.449 --> 02:20:55.751]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[02:20:55.991 --> 02:20:57.872]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.

[02:21:08.416 --> 02:21:09.337]  And fight gum disease.

[02:21:10.739 --> 02:21:19.908]  And regular use of Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash is a powerful front line of defense against gingivitis, bleeding gums, and folks with braces or dentures will love that clean, fresh, just from the dentist's office feeling.
[02:21:20.148 --> 02:21:23.412]  And once you've tried Vitamir, you just may find that no other toothpaste or mouthwash will do.

[02:21:46.981 --> 02:21:52.144]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.804 --> 02:21:55.226]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:56.346 --> 02:22:06.312]  Well, our current guest is our third guest today, and I'll take some phone calls coming up in the next two segments before we wrap up the show and hit on some other top news we haven't even mentioned yet.
[02:22:06.352 --> 02:22:14.117]  But, you know, people can argue all day that, oh, we've got to selectively...
[02:22:16.723 --> 02:22:20.084]  Or not be selective and just sell any of this art.
[02:22:20.965 --> 02:22:23.425]  And we're a prison rehabilitation program.
[02:22:23.966 --> 02:22:27.687]  I can understand that, but imagine how this sounds, how this is billed.
[02:22:28.067 --> 02:22:30.368]  They're making money off of killers' art.
[02:22:30.428 --> 02:22:31.328]  And it makes me sick.
[02:22:32.188 --> 02:22:33.008]  It makes me angry.
[02:22:33.028 --> 02:22:36.670]  And now these politicians are going to use this to restrict free speech.
[02:22:36.790 --> 02:22:43.912]  And I just think, as a cautionary note and tale, you have to then not have any truck...
[02:22:44.534 --> 02:22:54.461]  Well, a couple of things.
[02:22:57.143 --> 02:23:01.666]  I have an issue with what the politicians are doing with it, and I have an issue with what the media is doing with it.
[02:23:01.926 --> 02:23:05.549]  But I don't think you restrict free speech because of fear of that.
[02:23:05.969 --> 02:23:08.791]  If we said we only have free speech for people we admire...
[02:23:09.246 --> 02:23:10.586]  We say things we value.
[02:23:10.886 --> 02:23:11.866]  We don't have free speech.
[02:23:11.986 --> 02:23:17.007]  Well, understand, I'm not saying that these guys shouldn't be able to sell their artwork.
[02:23:17.047 --> 02:23:22.568]  And I understand what you're saying is they're already finding sickos to buy it.
[02:23:22.668 --> 02:23:28.749]  I understand you're buying artwork of some 15-year-old who was caught with a bag of cocaine.
[02:23:29.089 --> 02:23:30.590]  First offense got five years.
[02:23:30.650 --> 02:23:36.331]  I think he should be able to write poetry, do whatever, and make money off of it.
[02:23:36.351 --> 02:23:37.431]  I hope he makes a million bucks.
[02:23:37.531 --> 02:23:38.711]  I just think violent...
[02:23:39.371 --> 02:23:48.015]  Offenders, when it reaches this certain bar level, should need to be in a big, dark, dirty hole for the rest of their lives and not making money.
[02:23:48.055 --> 02:23:53.137]  But listen, I don't think they should be working in the prisons and making money for these private corporations.
[02:23:53.177 --> 02:23:55.178]  That's an incentive to put innocent people in prison.
[02:23:55.558 --> 02:23:57.039]  I'm against it all.
[02:23:57.399 --> 02:23:58.780]  All I know is it makes me sick.
[02:23:59.560 --> 02:23:59.980]  I hear you.
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:02.421]  And I'm kind of sickened by the media that's happened.
[02:24:02.781 --> 02:24:06.263]  Because nobody's looking at the work of any of these other artists.
[02:24:06.894 --> 02:24:17.759]  Nobody's looking at the issues of rehabilitation and in all honesty what they've done by broadcasting it in this way is they've opened old wounds for the family members of the people who got killed.
[02:24:18.199 --> 02:24:24.642]  We do an art show and we get art and we put it out and normally we don't know anything about the background of people who did it.
[02:24:25.042 --> 02:24:36.167]  All we know is in this example this is a picture of Jesus in the desert done on crayon and we put a maximum price that we think doesn't exploit a person's history and
[02:24:37.543 --> 02:24:43.909]  When somebody's locked up and punished, being locked up for the rest of your life is the punishment for the crime.
[02:24:44.650 --> 02:24:49.695]  If this man wrote an editorial and got paid for it, I'd have no issue with it.
[02:24:50.135 --> 02:24:54.339]  If this man drew a crayon picture and got paid for it, I'd have no issue for it.
[02:24:54.359 --> 02:24:58.683]  The only reason the crime is coming in is because the media is hyping it so much in Boston.
[02:24:59.344 --> 02:25:00.605]  And that's driving up the price.
[02:25:03.082 --> 02:25:04.623]  Well, yeah, people are going to buy these.
[02:25:05.584 --> 02:25:08.686]  Well, we've capped it, so there's a limit to how high the price is going to go.
[02:25:08.866 --> 02:25:12.848]  But ten minutes later, it's going to be selling a hundred times that.
[02:25:13.169 --> 02:25:19.813]  Yeah, but some sick person can contact the worst killer he knows who's doing time and buy something from him.
[02:25:19.873 --> 02:25:21.194]  That's not in our control.
[02:25:21.354 --> 02:25:25.597]  Well, I think in the final equation, it has just been hyped out of control and has...
[02:25:26.827 --> 02:25:27.848]  It's just propaganda.
[02:25:27.908 --> 02:25:29.789]  Anti-free speech propaganda.
[02:25:29.809 --> 02:25:31.930]  I think there are two basic values under here for me.
[02:25:32.410 --> 02:25:33.291]  One is free speech.
[02:25:33.651 --> 02:25:34.972]  You don't have to like the person.
[02:25:35.012 --> 02:25:36.713]  You don't have to like what the person did.
[02:25:37.133 --> 02:25:43.356]  But as long as it's not destructive speech like the fire in a crowded theater, I think it should be out there.
[02:25:43.697 --> 02:25:45.317]  The second thing is rehabilitation.
[02:25:45.698 --> 02:25:49.800]  You want people who are incarcerated to be getting a chance to develop
[02:25:50.299 --> 02:26:17.201]  I know, but what I'm saying is... Exactly, but what I'm saying is that this is going to be used to clamp down on communications by prisoners, period, in this giant military industrial prison slave grid complex that is the biggest sector of the economy now, that is the new America.
[02:26:17.221 --> 02:26:18.322]  That's the crime, Alex.
[02:26:19.286 --> 02:26:19.986]  That's the crime.
[02:26:20.106 --> 02:26:21.607]  Oh, believe me, I'm fully aware of it.
[02:26:21.687 --> 02:26:30.430]  I just know how they work, and it just makes me boil that... I'm not trying to attack you when you came on.
[02:26:30.450 --> 02:26:31.511]  No, I hear you.
[02:26:31.911 --> 02:26:33.872]  I guess I am emotional at a certain level.
[02:26:34.152 --> 02:26:35.912]  I mean, I'm more angry at the establishment.
[02:26:35.932 --> 02:26:37.593]  It's just that the way this world works...
[02:26:37.973 --> 02:26:43.015]  Everything is done in symbols and logos, and it's just simply communicated.
[02:26:43.315 --> 02:26:49.377]  And so when you get into the details, you find out that what you're doing, I would have to say, isn't bad.
[02:26:49.817 --> 02:26:57.580]  But just the way it's going to be sold and promoted, just what I got from this Reuters article, is that you're like evil scumballs making money off death.
[02:26:58.080 --> 02:26:58.320]  Right.
[02:26:58.640 --> 02:27:00.921]  And I think what you've got to do is fight the distortion.
[02:27:01.741 --> 02:27:04.322]  You can't live in a way that says, I won't speak.
[02:27:04.830 --> 02:27:07.351]  Because it can provoke a dangerous response.
[02:27:07.491 --> 02:27:09.332]  Hey, listen... You've got to speak and fight the response.
[02:27:09.732 --> 02:27:10.952]  We're on the same page there.
[02:27:12.033 --> 02:27:16.054]  I still think that... I mean, I wouldn't want to get anywhere near some serial killers are.
[02:27:16.214 --> 02:27:20.135]  It just makes... It gives me the creeps, but I understand what you're doing.
[02:27:20.275 --> 02:27:26.718]  You know, 98% of it isn't killers or serial killers, so... I appreciate you joining us.
[02:27:26.738 --> 02:27:29.459]  Well, thanks for the time, and keep up the good work out there.
[02:27:30.119 --> 02:27:30.879]  Okay, thank you.
[02:27:30.939 --> 02:27:32.340]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:32.780]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.389 --> 02:27:37.290]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.770 --> 02:27:39.371]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.391 --> 02:27:43.053]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.814 --> 02:27:47.815]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:27:47.855 --> 02:27:50.737]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:27:50.937 --> 02:27:56.320]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.081]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:27:58.121 --> 02:28:00.362]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:28:00.542 --> 02:28:04.104]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:28:04.264 --> 02:28:04.984]  We're good to go.
[02:28:27.113 --> 02:28:30.077]  Order the book and DVD now for one low price.

[02:28:35.444 --> 02:28:36.926]  Tell them you heard it on GCN.
[02:28:46.354 --> 02:28:47.996]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:48.116 --> 02:28:52.240]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.360 --> 02:28:55.223]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.323 --> 02:29:02.029]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.229 --> 02:29:05.232]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.433 --> 02:29:07.815]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.955 --> 02:29:10.077]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[02:29:10.077 --> 02:29:18.624]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[02:29:46.345 --> 02:29:53.230]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:29:53.370 --> 02:30:06.300]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:06.900]  Are you sick
[02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:08.521]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:30:23.408 --> 02:30:27.392]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:30:27.652 --> 02:30:29.514]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[02:30:29.654 --> 02:30:34.239]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.
[02:30:34.299 --> 02:30:36.021]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N Market.com.
[02:30:36.081 --> 02:30:36.621]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[02:30:45.839 --> 02:30:57.024]  Jake and JC and others will take a few of your calls here in a moment.
[02:31:06.589 --> 02:31:08.130]  It's all free.
[02:31:08.330 --> 02:31:10.752]  Remember to join us.
[02:31:10.772 --> 02:31:11.072]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:11.112 --> 02:31:12.133]  Jam a few of you in there.
[02:31:12.573 --> 02:31:13.994]  Move through your calls quickly, hopefully.
[02:31:14.014 --> 02:31:15.094]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:15.575 --> 02:31:18.957]  I was just talking to somebody up at the network.
[02:31:18.977 --> 02:31:19.857]  I'm not going to say who.
[02:31:20.958 --> 02:31:24.140]  And their girlfriend's uncle was killed by John Wayne Gacy.
[02:31:25.401 --> 02:31:32.305]  And the person I was talking to said it was always strange, and the families talked about, you know, why do people buy his art?
[02:31:33.221 --> 02:31:34.322]  Why was it popular?
[02:31:34.622 --> 02:31:36.723]  He did a lot of it and these sickos would pay for it.
[02:31:37.343 --> 02:31:40.624]  I wouldn't want that hanging in my house or hanging in my office.
[02:31:40.724 --> 02:31:44.126]  I mean, what on earth is wrong with people?
[02:31:44.646 --> 02:31:51.589]  And so you get a nice organization that goes out and gets people who are in jail's artwork and sells it and stuff, and they have a right to make money.
[02:31:52.924 --> 02:31:56.468]  I mean, the argument is, well, make them work doing something for society!
[02:31:57.509 --> 02:32:00.312]  Busting rocks or building widgets.
[02:32:00.413 --> 02:32:02.275]  That takes your job, folks.
[02:32:02.355 --> 02:32:03.756]  That is actually hurting you.
[02:32:03.776 --> 02:32:06.680]  20 cents an hour.
[02:32:08.226 --> 02:32:11.749]  By the way, if they don't do that, they get literally... What is it?
[02:32:11.829 --> 02:32:14.951]  I think a meal a day is like 89 cents or something on average.
[02:32:14.991 --> 02:32:17.013]  Or Pio's got it down to like 75 cents.
[02:32:17.794 --> 02:32:20.516]  Horrible pieces of bread falling apart with a piece of bologna.
[02:32:21.336 --> 02:32:23.118]  A little bag of cheap chips.
[02:32:23.418 --> 02:32:25.299]  Maybe one or two little carrots.
[02:32:26.020 --> 02:32:27.541]  Some of these places, they get nothing.
[02:32:27.821 --> 02:32:31.744]  It's lies about the color TVs and the hot tubs and the cable.
[02:32:32.345 --> 02:32:33.766]  It just isn't true.
[02:32:33.786 --> 02:32:35.727]  I mean, maybe it's some of these...
[02:32:37.964 --> 02:32:43.309]  Club Fed places where it's lower level security.
[02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:50.936]  But medium security, maximum security, these are hell holes where they do medical experiments on them, you name it.
[02:32:51.696 --> 02:32:53.158]  And most of them are innocent, folks.
[02:32:53.978 --> 02:32:57.762]  You go, wait a minute, I heard the article where they released a guy who killed three people.
[02:32:58.603 --> 02:32:59.884]  Yes, that's the incredible part.
[02:32:59.924 --> 02:33:01.065]  I've seen national statistics.
[02:33:03.334 --> 02:33:10.739]  Hardcore killers and rapists normally spend less time than, say, people for drug convictions.
[02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:13.361]  It's amazing.
[02:33:13.401 --> 02:33:16.042]  I mean, they want the nice little pothead who'll do the work.
[02:33:16.823 --> 02:33:17.683]  He isn't getting out.
[02:33:21.666 --> 02:33:23.127]  I've got some really important articles here.
[02:33:23.147 --> 02:33:24.988]  Here's one out of the Seattle Post-Intelligence Report.
[02:33:27.882 --> 02:33:31.866]  And it says, Iraqi cancer, birth defects, blame on USP uranium.
[02:33:31.886 --> 02:33:33.387]  And then they admit it's exploding.
[02:33:34.488 --> 02:33:35.269]  More than a tripling.
[02:33:35.309 --> 02:33:36.290]  Our troops have had a tripling.
[02:33:36.310 --> 02:33:39.633]  They've had more than a tripling because they're not just there a year and then rotate out.
[02:33:39.653 --> 02:33:40.454]  They're always there.
[02:33:41.395 --> 02:33:44.958]  And has a half-life of 4.5 billion years, it says here.
[02:33:45.359 --> 02:33:48.281]  So you rarely see that in the mainstream news, but here it is.
[02:33:49.262 --> 02:33:51.485]  And then, interesting article here out of...
[02:33:52.745 --> 02:33:53.546]  Las Vegas.
[02:33:53.626 --> 02:33:55.847]  Chemtrails are over Las Vegas.
[02:33:55.907 --> 02:33:58.729]  I want to mention that article as well.
[02:33:59.149 --> 02:34:02.772]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to Jake in Kansas City.
[02:34:02.792 --> 02:34:03.352]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:34:03.993 --> 02:34:04.773]  How you doing today, sir?
[02:34:05.033 --> 02:34:05.233]  Good.
[02:34:05.253 --> 02:34:05.894]  Good to hear from you.
[02:34:05.914 --> 02:34:06.434]  What's on your mind?
[02:34:06.915 --> 02:34:10.697]  I was calling to give you a little police state update from here in Kansas City.
[02:34:11.237 --> 02:34:11.578]  Pardon me.
[02:34:11.818 --> 02:34:16.321]  I was being trailed by a motorcycle cop on the Kansas side of the...
[02:34:17.148 --> 02:34:18.569]  State line here in Kansas City.
[02:34:18.689 --> 02:34:22.892]  Threw through a yellow light, was partially red as I went through it.
[02:34:23.573 --> 02:34:26.274]  In a big commercial vehicle, he immediately pulls me over.
[02:34:26.294 --> 02:34:32.619]  We get into a quick exchange over whether or not I was through the intersection while it was red.
[02:34:33.079 --> 02:34:35.141]  I said, well, how about the cameras on the poles?
[02:34:35.201 --> 02:34:36.422]  Could they be the tiebreaker?
[02:34:37.702 --> 02:34:41.625]  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, a switch went off in his head.
[02:34:41.645 --> 02:34:43.466]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[02:34:43.506 --> 02:34:44.607]  There's no cameras here.
[02:34:44.667 --> 02:34:45.608]  Those are not cameras.
[02:34:46.348 --> 02:34:47.931]  And I'm like, you know, I see them.
[02:34:48.031 --> 02:34:48.612]  They're right there.
[02:34:48.912 --> 02:34:49.433]  What is that?
[02:34:49.473 --> 02:34:51.556]  He goes, those are Department of Defense sensors.
[02:34:51.577 --> 02:34:52.458]  Those are not cameras.
[02:34:52.478 --> 02:34:54.000]  They do not record moving images.
[02:34:54.822 --> 02:34:59.169]  And I said, okay, well, if they're sensors, what are they sensing if it's not photographed?
[02:35:00.525 --> 02:35:05.629]  He started a sentence and then stopped it and then wrote me a ticket and continued on his way.
[02:35:05.709 --> 02:35:20.501]  But he was honest because MIT Magazine and several other major government publications admit that the Department of Defense designed the grid, had it put in by the states with federal money, and they literally call it a control grid.
[02:35:20.541 --> 02:35:21.322]  I didn't invent that.
[02:35:21.843 --> 02:35:27.127]  We are literally having a prison grid built on us and this guy blurted this out.
[02:35:27.387 --> 02:35:27.948]  It's real funny.
[02:35:28.910 --> 02:35:31.453]  So I was calling to see if you knew.
[02:35:32.674 --> 02:35:34.936]  Do those record moving images?
[02:35:35.036 --> 02:35:36.598]  I have to look at the sensor.
[02:35:36.638 --> 02:35:37.959]  I can tell you what the sensor is.
[02:35:38.800 --> 02:35:41.202]  Like I said, San Antonio, and I've been all over the country, folks.
[02:35:41.522 --> 02:35:43.684]  San Antonio is the first place I ever saw with them.
[02:35:43.724 --> 02:35:47.267]  I know Indiana was the second to get them once we got documents on it.
[02:35:47.748 --> 02:35:51.671]  And then now they've gone in coast to coast, even four-way stops in the middle of nowhere.
[02:35:51.711 --> 02:35:52.132]  I've seen them.
[02:35:53.279 --> 02:35:54.120]  Up in Minnesota.
[02:35:54.600 --> 02:35:55.601]  Well, let me tell you.
[02:35:55.621 --> 02:35:56.962]  They have little antenna arrays.
[02:35:57.802 --> 02:36:00.324]  They have little infrared scanners.
[02:36:00.704 --> 02:36:02.225]  They have license plate scanners.
[02:36:02.605 --> 02:36:13.492]  They have a special scanner that even if there isn't a luminance paint built into the tags like we have in Texas, the plates, the computer actually reads numbers.
[02:36:13.672 --> 02:36:15.673]  So it's a camera, but they call it a scanner.
[02:36:16.033 --> 02:36:19.155]  And it can instantly read just hundreds of numbers instantly.
[02:36:19.395 --> 02:36:20.076]  We're good to go.
[02:36:41.952 --> 02:36:42.712]  Thoroughly agree.
[02:36:42.732 --> 02:36:43.773]  I mean, it's the end of the country.
[02:37:08.115 --> 02:37:09.016]  Bye-bye, America.
[02:37:09.056 --> 02:37:12.520]  Plant some daisies on top of the plot.
[02:37:14.703 --> 02:37:17.626]  Swing low, sweet chariot coming to carry us home.
[02:37:17.646 --> 02:37:21.831]  I mean, they're with pleasure drawing the knife across the throat.
[02:37:21.851 --> 02:37:23.933]  The arteries start to spew and splatter.
[02:37:23.953 --> 02:37:27.337]  They're going to keep going to the next one, and pretty soon there won't be no coming home.
[02:37:30.097 --> 02:37:38.469]  And all those cops and all those government people would have broken Humpty Dumpty and there'll be no putting it back together again without totally revamping the country.
[02:37:38.890 --> 02:37:40.973]  And their kids and their future and everything's gone.
[02:37:41.193 --> 02:37:41.734]  They don't care.
[02:37:41.814 --> 02:37:42.215]  They love it.
[02:37:42.896 --> 02:37:43.437]  Thanks for the call.
[02:37:44.582 --> 02:37:49.489]  They just absolutely love leaving 20-plus thousand POWs to die in World War II publicly.
[02:37:49.769 --> 02:37:51.511]  They absolutely love the troops breathing DEU.
[02:37:51.551 --> 02:37:52.593]  They love dying of cancer.
[02:37:52.933 --> 02:37:55.596]  They love injecting their children themselves with deadly poison.
[02:37:55.917 --> 02:37:57.479]  They love drinking fluoride water.
[02:37:57.519 --> 02:37:59.882]  They just laugh at us and go, Give me a big old goblet.
[02:38:00.042 --> 02:38:00.583]  I love it.
[02:38:00.763 --> 02:38:01.985]  That Alex is a liar.
[02:38:02.385 --> 02:38:03.646]  I love the government.
[02:38:03.686 --> 02:38:04.386]  I love it.
[02:38:04.406 --> 02:38:04.787]  I love it.
[02:38:05.247 --> 02:38:06.288]  I mean, really, that's the attitude.
[02:38:06.328 --> 02:38:07.849]  It's just a wanton evil.
[02:38:07.869 --> 02:38:09.950]  Just a wanton self-destructiveness.
[02:38:10.210 --> 02:38:14.473]  I got a shaved head, and I got a black uniform, and I don't care that they're using me.
[02:38:14.653 --> 02:38:17.394]  I want to exercise power, and I'm going to do it!
[02:38:19.976 --> 02:38:20.937]  That's the attitude right there.
[02:38:20.957 --> 02:38:22.558]  Just, I'm going to keep my power!
[02:38:23.258 --> 02:38:25.079]  Don't you try to tell me nothing, boy!
[02:38:27.160 --> 02:38:29.662]  Rarison, Connecticut, up there in devil worship country.
[02:38:29.702 --> 02:38:31.023]  How you doing, Rarison?
[02:38:32.803 --> 02:38:34.103]  That's what you always call it, huh?
[02:38:35.184 --> 02:38:41.425]  Well, I mean, no, there's a lot of great folks, I'm sure, in Connecticut, but it's not one of the biggest concentrations of sacrifice.
[02:38:41.505 --> 02:38:47.446]  I wasn't even at Yale, I was at UConn, and I heard about S&B.
[02:38:48.066 --> 02:38:51.266]  So, it's not really news to me.
[02:38:51.306 --> 02:38:52.907]  I was going to make two comments.
[02:38:53.447 --> 02:38:56.827]  One about this prison art thing.
[02:38:57.368 --> 02:38:59.848]  Wouldn't that be sort of a bar drawn where...
[02:39:01.894 --> 02:39:03.415]  Well, you're right.
[02:39:03.815 --> 02:39:09.657]  Actually by restricting it, you're going to jack up the price and really make it valuable.
[02:39:30.686 --> 02:39:32.447]  Except it can never be bought.
[02:39:33.908 --> 02:39:35.329]  That's the whole idea.
[02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:36.370]  It can never be bought.
[02:39:36.390 --> 02:39:37.971]  It can only be rented.
[02:39:38.011 --> 02:39:42.614]  So you're saying that way they still get their free speech, they just don't get to make money off of it.
[02:39:43.134 --> 02:39:43.754]  Exactly.
[02:39:44.255 --> 02:39:46.716]  But I think the renting would be making money, though.
[02:39:47.177 --> 02:39:48.558]  But I see what you're saying.
[02:39:48.578 --> 02:39:52.820]  Look, I don't want to restrict free speech, but somebody's got to have some taste.
[02:39:53.661 --> 02:39:56.623]  People shouldn't be running around selling John Wayne Gacy stuff.
[02:39:57.699 --> 02:40:03.523]  Well, hey, people are paying for... They're paying $10,000 for burpees.
[02:40:03.784 --> 02:40:05.165]  Are we really surprised about this?
[02:40:07.286 --> 02:40:07.746]  Excuse me?
[02:40:07.786 --> 02:40:09.428]  They're doing what?
[02:40:09.768 --> 02:40:26.740]  Back in the... You know, some of those fads with the kids' toys, they were paying $10,000 on eBay for these things because, I don't know, they don't have control over their kids' bank accounts anymore.
[02:40:27.615 --> 02:40:53.114]  Anyway, the other comment I want to make is for anybody who doubts some of the things that are going on with the prison system that's being set up around us, even in the long shot that we have a wonderful government and this is just somebody hedging their bets, this is a government that has no faith in its citizens.
[02:40:53.635 --> 02:40:54.996]  How can we have faith in them?
[02:40:56.576 --> 02:40:58.317]  No, I hear you and I appreciate the call.
[02:41:00.137 --> 02:41:02.258]  There's just a lot of bad things that are happening.
[02:41:03.438 --> 02:41:04.499]  And it's getting worse.
[02:41:04.699 --> 02:41:07.560]  And the criminals in government are all protected.
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:12.121]  And some of these massive crimes, they get off scot-free and they do more and more and more.
[02:41:12.141 --> 02:41:18.684]  And then every time I go to a national park or a state park, they're just rude to me and rude to other people.
[02:41:19.104 --> 02:41:25.446]  I talked about how they were rude to me at Enchanted Rock and I got a bunch of emails, well-written, nice emails,
[02:41:29.031 --> 02:41:29.891]  It's just amazing.
[02:41:31.232 --> 02:41:34.213]  People are upset about what's happening.
[02:41:35.533 --> 02:41:38.574]  I mean, when you can't even go to... When I was a little kid, people were nice to you.
[02:41:38.634 --> 02:41:39.475]  Cops were nice.
[02:41:41.415 --> 02:41:42.656]  Park rangers were nice.
[02:41:42.776 --> 02:41:44.036]  Government isn't nice now.
[02:41:44.056 --> 02:41:54.220]  They just walk around with their eyes bugged out, feeling like, as one emailer said, it's their own private nature preserve, and they'd get paid to be enjoying it if you just weren't there, you scum.
[02:41:55.655 --> 02:41:56.376]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:41:56.396 --> 02:41:56.776]  We're good to go.
[02:41:56.796 --> 02:41:56.976]  I think?
[02:42:22.486 --> 02:42:28.571]  Little scrawny guys out there just going through a manhood ritual, I guess.
[02:42:29.031 --> 02:42:30.172]  Boxing with each other.
[02:42:30.272 --> 02:42:30.833]  So what?
[02:42:30.853 --> 02:42:32.034]  Some people got some bruises.
[02:42:32.114 --> 02:42:32.694]  So what?
[02:42:32.714 --> 02:42:36.077]  I mean, this country was founded on stuff like that.
[02:42:36.197 --> 02:42:42.862]  I mean, 50 years ago, most young men were in golden gloves and they'd at least go to a year or two of boxing.
[02:42:44.464 --> 02:42:48.727]  I know that most of my family was in boxing.
[02:42:50.468 --> 02:42:50.989]  So what?
[02:42:52.192 --> 02:42:54.634]  People would go meet under a tree and have boxing matches.
[02:42:55.375 --> 02:42:56.916]  And if somebody, you know what?
[02:42:57.536 --> 02:43:08.285]  If two young men were getting into a fight at school, the coach would literally grab them by the scrub of the neck, drag them outside, put gloves on, and say, all right, you're going to do 12 rounds.
[02:43:08.305 --> 02:43:14.810]  And by the time they were puking from being so tired and totally exhausted and bruised, they became friends and never fought again.
[02:43:15.130 --> 02:43:16.611]  Oh, no, you don't do that now.
[02:43:16.931 --> 02:43:18.092]  You go shoot each other.
[02:43:18.132 --> 02:43:18.793]  That's what you do.
[02:43:20.852 --> 02:43:26.035]  But the indicator here is they had some reports 20, some 15, the cops say only 12.
[02:43:27.315 --> 02:43:28.436]  Yesterday it was 10, now it's 12.
[02:43:30.056 --> 02:43:45.744]  Special tactical teams sneaking around in the woods, and they run up on these yuppie kids in their polo shirts, driving their Mercedes Benz, and they're out there under a tree, boxing with these huge, full-size, not training gloves, boxing gloves on.
[02:43:47.046 --> 02:43:58.175]  And they arrest them, and it's a big statewide investigation, and now there's talk of banning dojos and sparring, and you just can't do that.
[02:43:58.215 --> 02:43:59.836]  And again, they've banned tag.
[02:44:00.437 --> 02:44:03.519]  They arrest you if they catch you doing it, or at least take you to the principal's office.
[02:44:03.980 --> 02:44:06.382]  I have seen cases of arrests being made for dodgeball.
[02:44:06.702 --> 02:44:07.242]  They ban it.
[02:44:08.163 --> 02:44:10.225]  Middle school kids sneak a ball in their bag.
[02:44:10.245 --> 02:44:11.866]  They all go behind the cafeteria.
[02:44:12.447 --> 02:44:15.309]  Whereas we were behind the cafeteria smoking cigarettes in high school.
[02:44:16.408 --> 02:44:19.291]  I guess now they go behind the cafeteria and play dodgeball.
[02:44:19.311 --> 02:44:22.213]  That's the big, evil, dirty, criminal thing to do.
[02:44:22.453 --> 02:44:24.314]  Did you bring the little rubber softball?
[02:44:24.755 --> 02:44:25.715]  Yes, I brought it.
[02:44:26.016 --> 02:44:26.696]  Here it is.
[02:44:26.716 --> 02:44:28.938]  We're going to do something really radical now.
[02:44:30.758 --> 02:44:37.822]  And confirm reports, you know, down in San Antonio, troops swaggering around the middle schools to keep the kids in line.
[02:44:39.103 --> 02:44:40.384]  This is enslavement.
[02:44:40.444 --> 02:44:42.145]  This is not a free society.
[02:44:42.725 --> 02:44:44.846]  This is government saying, we own you.
[02:44:44.866 --> 02:44:46.527]  Well, I got news for you.
[02:44:46.547 --> 02:44:47.468]  You don't own me.
[02:44:48.088 --> 02:44:48.768]  You idiots.
[02:44:49.849 --> 02:44:51.830]  And by the way, you're not part of this system either.
[02:44:51.870 --> 02:44:53.571]  This system's going to take your pension fund.
[02:44:53.591 --> 02:44:55.052]  This system's going to rape you.
[02:44:55.092 --> 02:44:56.953]  They've said they're going to do it, you idiots.
[02:44:58.078 --> 02:45:00.921]  I'm talking to people who think they're part of this system and that are very naive.
[02:45:01.401 --> 02:45:02.082]  Listen to me.
[02:45:02.523 --> 02:45:05.225]  Our entire society is in grave danger.
[02:45:05.245 --> 02:45:11.351]  And if you don't have the moral courage to have some self-preservation in you, then I have no respect for you.
[02:45:13.954 --> 02:45:15.055]  I'm so sick of it!
[02:45:16.116 --> 02:45:17.718]  Classical tyrannies unfolding!
[02:45:19.119 --> 02:45:27.223]  We just came upon a new document today that the Department of Defense is just now putting out, that we're writing an article on, and I'll tell you the details of it tomorrow.
[02:45:27.243 --> 02:45:27.963]  You're not going to believe it.
[02:45:27.983 --> 02:45:28.964]  Well, I guess you will believe it.
[02:45:30.765 --> 02:45:33.726]  Here's one that's up on InfoWars.com right now we put together.
[02:45:34.127 --> 02:45:36.888]  NBC's Law and Order implies that Minutemen are murderers.
[02:45:36.908 --> 02:45:45.952]  A listener sent us to the link, and they have the description on the website about the evil Minutemen and the murder investigation, how the Minutemen are killing innocent people.
[02:45:45.992 --> 02:45:46.813]  They're so evil.
[02:45:47.674 --> 02:45:49.175]  And I wrote this comment this morning.
[02:45:50.116 --> 02:46:03.008]  Because the Minutemen are doing a great job and now receiving support from governors and congressmen, the controlled media is turning up the heat with TV shows based on fraudulent scenarios where Minutemen are out murdering innocent people.
[02:46:03.968 --> 02:46:05.369]  Perception becomes reality.
[02:46:05.389 --> 02:46:09.634]  This is pure slander designed to demonize anyone fighting to maintain U.S.
[02:46:09.694 --> 02:46:10.234]  sovereignty.
[02:46:10.254 --> 02:46:16.921]  90% of the propaganda that Infowars.com tracks isn't in news articles or on news shows.
[02:46:16.981 --> 02:46:18.242]  It's in fiction programs.
[02:46:19.343 --> 02:46:24.808]  That is where the battle for the people's minds is being waged predominantly, and we need to be aware of it.
[02:46:25.349 --> 02:46:26.390]  And then here it is, episode 16.
[02:46:29.808 --> 02:46:33.190]  Murder of smuggling trucker could be linked to Border Patrol Group.
[02:46:33.490 --> 02:46:46.836]  When the owner of a big rigged trucking company is shot to death, detectives Fontaine and Green learn that the victim was hauling illegal aliens and suspect a member, Daniel Roebuck, Citizens Border Patrol Group.
[02:46:47.409 --> 02:46:52.671]  But their only witness is an undocumented Hispanic woman who risks deportation if she testifies.
[02:46:53.171 --> 02:47:00.954]  Meanwhile, Prosecutor McCoy is incensed when the witness is physically intimidated as he tries to turn one organization member against the other.
[02:47:01.835 --> 02:47:05.156]  Oh, see, the Minutemen are being mean to the poor Hispanic lady.
[02:47:05.636 --> 02:47:09.098]  You see, when they can't get any real events, they just manufacture them.
[02:47:09.738 --> 02:47:14.920]  So now when Minutemen are out there on the border, there'll be some weak-minded cops pull up and in their head, these are killers.
[02:47:15.720 --> 02:47:17.101]  And see, all that's simulated.
[02:47:17.831 --> 02:47:22.397]  All the psychological studies show that the brain interprets all this is real.
[02:47:24.199 --> 02:47:34.952]  And they've got a hundred TV shows I've seen just when I used to watch TV where guns are evil, gun owners are all murderers, people that talk about one world government are psychotic killers that abuse their children.
[02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:41.091]  They show on TV shows where people get arrested for talking about the New World Order?
[02:47:41.671 --> 02:47:42.711]  You're being conditioned.
[02:47:42.751 --> 02:47:43.992]  I mean, let me ask the cops something.
[02:47:44.192 --> 02:47:45.432]  Do you like being brainwashed?
[02:47:45.452 --> 02:47:46.852]  Do you like them calling you stupid?
[02:47:47.032 --> 02:47:48.453]  Do you like them laughing at you?
[02:47:48.613 --> 02:47:49.213]  Do you like it?
[02:47:49.713 --> 02:47:51.193]  Do you like what they're doing to you?
[02:47:51.993 --> 02:47:53.314]  Do you like going along with it?
[02:47:53.334 --> 02:47:54.414]  Do you like being fools?
[02:47:54.694 --> 02:47:58.615]  I know a lot of you aren't fools, and you know what's going on, but you just keep your head down.
[02:47:58.835 --> 02:48:01.976]  Well, America can't survive if we just keep our head down.
[02:48:04.341 --> 02:48:07.825]  You know, there is a time to hold them and to fold them and to walk away and to run.
[02:48:08.285 --> 02:48:12.730]  But there's also a time to get up and get in people's faces and take action and be aggressive.
[02:48:13.671 --> 02:48:14.952]  And they can't bring us all down.
[02:48:14.972 --> 02:48:16.073]  They can't stop us all.
[02:48:18.035 --> 02:48:19.877]  I know a lot of you signed up to defend this country.
[02:48:19.897 --> 02:48:20.498]  Let me tell you something.
[02:48:20.518 --> 02:48:23.080]  You've been incrementally warped and turned to the dark side.
[02:48:23.100 --> 02:48:25.062]  You better wake up to what you're part of right now.
[02:48:25.903 --> 02:48:27.565]  This republic is being destroyed.
[02:48:28.286 --> 02:48:33.148]  The terrorists are in control of the intelligence agencies and in control of the White House.
[02:48:33.388 --> 02:48:34.629]  They're carrying out the terror.
[02:48:35.209 --> 02:48:37.350]  And more and more prominent people are telling them like it is.
[02:48:38.470 --> 02:48:39.011]  Join us.
[02:48:39.231 --> 02:48:40.451]  Defend the Republic.
[02:48:40.831 --> 02:48:43.472]  Take a final call at a few final news items on the other side.
[02:48:43.893 --> 02:48:44.413]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.801 --> 02:48:49.744]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:48:50.404 --> 02:48:51.685]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:51.885 --> 02:48:57.630]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:57.910 --> 02:49:03.135]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:04.456 --> 02:49:11.544]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:49:11.824 --> 02:49:16.469]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:49:16.549 --> 02:49:22.816]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.856 --> 02:49:24.678]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:49:25.138 --> 02:49:27.240]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[02:49:27.321 --> 02:49:29.903]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:30.444 --> 02:49:33.727]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:34.468 --> 02:49:38.852]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[02:49:38.973 --> 02:49:40.955]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[02:49:41.195 --> 02:49:42.716]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:42.897 --> 02:49:44.979]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:46.130 --> 02:49:51.352]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.492 --> 02:49:59.575]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.835 --> 02:50:06.817]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.578 --> 02:50:19.608]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodide.
[02:50:19.728 --> 02:50:28.616]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.876 --> 02:50:32.159]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:55.497 --> 02:51:56.958]  Look, it isn't my opinion, police.
[02:51:58.478 --> 02:52:01.539]  Government minions, people listening right now on the radio.
[02:52:03.380 --> 02:52:06.141]  Your bosses put cancer viruses in the vaccines you took.
[02:52:07.561 --> 02:52:09.141]  They put mercury in them on purpose.
[02:52:11.142 --> 02:52:11.342]  Why?
[02:52:11.382 --> 02:52:13.643]  Because they're just going to make more money when you're in their hospitals.
[02:52:13.803 --> 02:52:15.143]  They want to consolidate control.
[02:52:16.864 --> 02:52:18.144]  They brainwash the doctors.
[02:52:18.184 --> 02:52:20.945]  They give them false medical handbooks.
[02:52:20.985 --> 02:52:22.465]  They teach them false systems.
[02:52:22.505 --> 02:52:24.006]  They give them false diagnoses.
[02:52:26.101 --> 02:52:27.642]  That's just one little area of this.
[02:52:27.702 --> 02:52:30.103]  And again, it's so evil, you can't face it.
[02:52:30.703 --> 02:52:31.804]  You can't deal with it.
[02:52:31.844 --> 02:52:33.105]  Well, the proof is in the pudding.
[02:52:36.406 --> 02:52:38.527]  I mean, everything we've talked about has come true.
[02:52:38.807 --> 02:52:40.708]  I'm sorry that we've been right.
[02:52:42.009 --> 02:52:43.050]  I don't like what's happening.
[02:52:43.090 --> 02:52:43.950]  It freaks me out.
[02:52:45.571 --> 02:52:46.151]  But I know this.
[02:52:46.191 --> 02:52:50.353]  Things aren't getting better by doing nothing and by going along with this.
[02:52:52.374 --> 02:52:53.495]  I want to try to go to Dylan and
[02:52:56.286 --> 02:52:56.946]  We're good to go.
[02:52:56.966 --> 02:52:57.607]  We're good to go.
[02:53:18.135 --> 02:53:32.539]  Please go to InfoWars.com and get Martial Law, get Codex Magica, get Descent into Tyranny, get the videos, the books, the books on tape, the pro-America, pro-Second Amendment t-shirts, liberal t-shirts, by the way, anti-gun, you're now conservative.
[02:53:33.239 --> 02:53:35.280]  You need to have these materials.
[02:53:35.300 --> 02:53:36.460]  You need to defend the country.
[02:53:36.480 --> 02:53:38.720]  You need to let people know we're not going along with it.
[02:53:39.221 --> 02:53:44.382]  They've been sending up their trial balloons, and we've been saying no to them, and that's good news, but we're not out of the woods yet.
[02:53:46.411 --> 02:53:49.953]  So InfoWars.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[02:53:50.533 --> 02:53:54.195]  Or call toll-free to get the videos 1-888-253-3139.
[02:53:54.215 --> 02:54:04.101]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv where you can see all 13 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, special reports.
[02:54:05.182 --> 02:54:09.984]  We've got two new special reports coming up this week.
[02:54:11.105 --> 02:54:14.387]  One, a video interview I did with the father of weather weapons,
[02:54:15.994 --> 02:54:20.757]  And another I did with Watson and his brother here in the studio a few days ago, the video of that.
[02:54:21.518 --> 02:54:24.240]  So a lot more going up there on the site, literally on a weekly basis.
[02:54:24.260 --> 02:54:26.601]  Well, many times on a daily basis with the audio files.
[02:54:28.403 --> 02:54:29.884]  Dylan in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:54:29.944 --> 02:54:30.264]  Welcome.
[02:54:31.144 --> 02:54:31.825]  Good day, Alex.
[02:54:32.605 --> 02:54:33.586]  And good day, everybody.
[02:54:34.407 --> 02:54:37.969]  I want to comment on your third interview today.
[02:54:38.369 --> 02:54:38.690]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:38.910 --> 02:54:43.893]  Yeah, I can see why you said you got a little confused there at first.
[02:54:44.133 --> 02:54:44.614]  That was a...
[02:54:46.149 --> 02:54:47.992]  That was a confusing issue.
[02:54:48.012 --> 02:54:56.329]  The right of the convicted... Was he convicted as being a child molester, murderer?
[02:54:57.601 --> 02:55:01.865]  And he was producing some art that he could sell to the outside world.
[02:55:01.925 --> 02:55:03.887]  Well, no, it wasn't a child molester.
[02:55:03.927 --> 02:55:04.847]  It was just as bad.
[02:55:04.887 --> 02:55:06.389]  He killed women, four women.
[02:55:06.569 --> 02:55:13.094]  And my point is that if they take his right away, then everybody loses their right.
[02:55:13.154 --> 02:55:21.942]  But here's the other problem in that equation, and that is that we just cannot allow people like that to make money off their crimes.
[02:55:22.845 --> 02:55:25.928]  Okay, so what was the... I have another question.
[02:55:26.188 --> 02:55:27.049]  What was the art?
[02:55:27.289 --> 02:55:28.189]  What did it depict?
[02:55:28.570 --> 02:55:31.052]  A picture of Jesus.
[02:55:31.192 --> 02:55:32.113]  Nothing grotesque?
[02:55:32.253 --> 02:55:33.294]  Just a picture of Jesus?
[02:55:33.734 --> 02:55:34.855]  I'm just curious about the art.
[02:55:34.895 --> 02:55:36.136]  Yes, that's a picture of Jesus.
[02:55:36.716 --> 02:55:39.218]  Well, it's a very deep issue.
[02:55:40.259 --> 02:55:48.065]  The Constitution, the Fifth Amendment, does say that no person shall be deprived of life or liberty without the process of law.
[02:55:48.626 --> 02:55:52.289]  So if their life is not taken, because we don't institute the death...
[02:56:00.072 --> 02:56:01.832]  Well, it's cruel and unusual punishment.
[02:56:01.892 --> 02:56:04.353]  That ties into the Seventh Amendment.
[02:56:04.553 --> 02:56:05.173]  We're out of time.
[02:56:05.193 --> 02:56:06.214]  I had a bunch of other callers.
[02:56:06.274 --> 02:56:07.094]  I apologize to you.
[02:56:07.134 --> 02:56:10.395]  Call me back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[02:56:10.435 --> 02:56:15.116]  Of course, we're also here at night, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:56:15.911 --> 02:56:19.113]  And you can always find us on the internet at Infowars.com.
[02:56:19.573 --> 02:56:21.374]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:21.394 --> 02:56:22.414]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.554 --> 02:56:23.415]  Have a great day.
