[00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:06.266]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.907 --> 00:00:07.967]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.668 --> 00:00:09.768]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.428 --> 00:00:11.269]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:12.910]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.492]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:21.914]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.636 --> 00:00:29.037]  Boy, I tell ya!
[00:00:29.898 --> 00:00:32.259]  The weeks are just blasting past us.
[00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:36.608]  Already the 14th day of January 2005.
[00:00:36.708 --> 00:00:40.889]  Wide open phones today.
[00:00:40.909 --> 00:00:42.270]  I want to take a lot of your calls.
[00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.091]  I'm going to go to your calls in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:50.018 --> 00:01:00.463]  Any news item, any issue, any comment, any question, it's welcome here on this broadcast against the global tyranny, known as the New World Order, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:00.723 --> 00:01:13.430]  The websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, and prisonplanet.tv, as well as infowars.net.
[00:01:15.731 --> 00:01:19.333]  You know, they're going to have the military out at the inauguration
[00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:22.011]  of our great leader next week.
[00:01:23.352 --> 00:01:31.217]  They're also going to have 400 TSA airport screener employees out harassing the public.
[00:01:32.158 --> 00:01:37.181]  And Governor Ridge, our great leader, about to be replaced by Mr. Chertoff,
[00:01:39.088 --> 00:01:45.992]  Well, Governor Ridge is quoted on the Army website as saying this is an example of what the rest of the country is going to be like.
[00:01:46.032 --> 00:01:50.594]  They're going to duplicate this integration between the military and the police.
[00:01:50.614 --> 00:01:57.518]  And I've got Ridge on tape on Fox News saying we've got to get rid of posse commentatas and put troops on the streets.
[00:01:58.518 --> 00:02:01.580]  Troops on the streets, boys and girls, aren't for terrorists.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.162]  Troops on the streets are for a military dictatorship.
[00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:10.565]  And you hear this nomenclature everywhere in the last decade creeping in.
[00:02:11.366 --> 00:02:14.428]  The media started saying it with the government, now everybody's picked it up.
[00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.211]  Firemen, police officers, mailmen.
[00:02:18.852 --> 00:02:20.974]  They call us civilians!
[00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:24.116]  Well, what does that make them?
[00:02:24.517 --> 00:02:27.959]  I've heard mayors call the general public civilians.
[00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:30.081]  No, we're citizens.
[00:02:31.022 --> 00:02:32.443]  We're sovereigns.
[00:02:33.274 --> 00:02:34.675]  We are the authorities.
[00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:36.297]  We are the bosses.
[00:02:36.857 --> 00:02:40.801]  That's what the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, and Constitution says.
[00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:47.386]  Only in nations under martial law do they call the citizens civilians.
[00:02:48.347 --> 00:02:49.628]  Let me just tell the police this.
[00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:51.530]  You are civilians.
[00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:58.336]  You're not in the armed forces, and you're not overseas patrolling some captured third world country.
[00:02:58.676 --> 00:02:59.257]  Or are you?
[00:03:00.874 --> 00:03:04.375]  But see how just that term hangs out there in front of us.
[00:03:06.076 --> 00:03:12.439]  It's like the politicians telling us, Republicans and Democrats, until we accept it, we are a democracy.
[00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.099]  We are a democracy.
[00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.960]  We are a democracy!
[00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:26.625]  Funny, that's one of the few things the Founding Fathers agreed on, was that we were not a democracy, and a democracy always led to dictatorship.
[00:03:29.226 --> 00:03:29.666]  Oh yes!
[00:03:31.454 --> 00:03:47.224]  You see, in a democracy, if 51% of people say, take that man's farm and give it to us, or put black people at the end of a plowshare instead of a mule, it happens.
[00:03:48.184 --> 00:03:53.588]  But in a republic, the minority, as well as the majority, are protected.
[00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:55.309]  There are codified laws
[00:03:56.559 --> 00:04:06.543]  Based in the bedrock of the Constitution that the government cannot violate and it is very restricted in what it can do.
[00:04:09.324 --> 00:04:11.185]  So all these definitions are changing.
[00:04:12.105 --> 00:04:23.170]  And these poor foolish people that do nothing but watch the different sitcoms and dramas on TV and football will argue with those of us that are politically informed about the way this country really works.
[00:04:23.996 --> 00:04:27.539]  They don't have any terms, any facts, any history, nothing!
[00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.481]  But their arrogance.
[00:04:32.002 --> 00:04:35.685]  But their psychological association with the power structure.
[00:04:36.926 --> 00:04:38.467]  And they're nothing but pathetic slaves.
[00:04:39.528 --> 00:04:41.450]  So there's so much news today.
[00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.831]  A caller called in about New York.
[00:04:43.872 --> 00:04:49.416]  I did get the AP article where two guys told a joke about lawyers being liars and were arrested.
[00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:52.380]  See these type of reports every day.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.361]  There's just so much coming up.
[00:04:54.841 --> 00:04:55.702]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:56.482]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.996 --> 00:05:07.841]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.161 --> 00:05:09.522]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.723 --> 00:05:11.944]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.084 --> 00:05:14.166]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.446 --> 00:05:19.370]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.753]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.013 --> 00:05:25.775]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:25.855 --> 00:05:36.504]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.644 --> 00:05:38.545]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:42.609]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns of the Info War.
[00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:43.990]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:47.813 --> 00:05:50.034]  That's 888-2533139.
[00:05:50.134 --> 00:05:54.816]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:05:55.056 --> 00:05:55.756]  Again, that number, 888-2533139.
[00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.071]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.191 --> 00:06:06.292]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:09.334]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:09.394 --> 00:06:16.116]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.296 --> 00:06:19.298]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:19.498 --> 00:06:21.899]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.019 --> 00:06:29.902]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:06:30.282 --> 00:06:41.508]  Benzene, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:41.648 --> 00:06:49.271]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:49.592]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.632 --> 00:06:51.032]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:01.098 --> 00:07:08.382]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[00:07:08.762 --> 00:07:13.424]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[00:07:13.664 --> 00:07:17.526]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[00:07:17.766 --> 00:07:20.708]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[00:07:21.008 --> 00:07:27.854]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[00:07:28.134 --> 00:07:36.701]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:07:37.022 --> 00:07:43.367]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[00:07:43.727 --> 00:07:47.989]  Call International Health for your free audio information package at 1-800-974-1879.
[00:07:49.970 --> 00:07:52.831]  We're so sure it works, we guarantee it.
[00:07:53.031 --> 00:07:57.713]  That's 1-800-974-1879 or visit supersilver.net.
[00:08:02.195 --> 00:08:08.237]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.838 --> 00:08:11.819]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:40.011]  Lord Ridge, Governor Ridge, gal lighter for Bush and his masters, the globalists, has come out with Europe and others and said we've got to standardize all of our national ID cards now and our passports with the same system of face scanning and thumb printing for our world ID cards.
[00:08:41.508 --> 00:08:51.534]  And the UN came out years ago and said we've all got to have standardized driver's license at the state level, that is, at the country level, the national level.
[00:08:52.595 --> 00:08:53.695]  And so this is what they do.
[00:08:53.735 --> 00:09:06.783]  They bring you into a Pan-American Union, a EU, European Union, an Asian Union, through the guise of trade deals, then merge our social security systems, merge our law enforcement,
[00:09:07.777 --> 00:09:12.521]  And I have another article where they're merging our law enforcement with, quote, foreign assets.
[00:09:12.561 --> 00:09:16.044]  This is all in your face happening.
[00:09:16.364 --> 00:09:17.746]  But it's all for security.
[00:09:18.326 --> 00:09:20.588]  All to keep us safe from Al-Syedah.
[00:09:21.008 --> 00:09:24.691]  But the borders must stay wide open, of course.
[00:09:26.473 --> 00:09:31.177]  And so we see the headlines, Washington prepares for Bush inauguration.
[00:09:32.054 --> 00:09:40.277]  And a couple days ago they've got a general on TV standing on a giant map that was the floor, and he's walking around a map of D.C.
[00:09:40.337 --> 00:09:42.978]  talking about how the military is going to keep you safe.
[00:09:43.519 --> 00:09:49.901]  That image on national television of a man in uniform standing on a huge map of D.C.
[00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:59.285]  He's the guardian, the great military officer, a thousand feet tall, standing above the people protecting them.
[00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:09.004]  Oh yes, in North Korea, that's the posters they use are maps of the cities in the country with a huge military man standing over it.
[00:10:09.384 --> 00:10:12.846]  And all of these images are carefully crafted.
[00:10:13.486 --> 00:10:19.008]  You know, the billboards, George W. Bush, our leader now popping up.
[00:10:20.569 --> 00:10:21.229]  It's insane.
[00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:28.793]  But don't worry, your Christian conservative leader has banned crosses in the inauguration.
[00:10:30.308 --> 00:10:31.168]  On the parade route.
[00:10:31.449 --> 00:10:32.309]  Just can't have them.
[00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:33.589]  They might upset someone.
[00:10:34.189 --> 00:10:35.770]  Why, it's the freedom of America.
[00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:39.271]  And it's the most expensive, biggest inauguration ever.
[00:10:40.571 --> 00:10:46.133]  They have hired hundreds of flower arrangers to arrange all the flowers.
[00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:48.153]  It's just ridiculous.
[00:10:48.193 --> 00:10:50.894]  It's our emperor, Caesar.
[00:10:51.354 --> 00:10:53.475]  Presidents never behave like this before.
[00:10:54.329 --> 00:10:56.530]  It's gotten worse and worse in the last 50 years.
[00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:59.551]  This is how Caesars behave.
[00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:05.413]  And Caesars would say what you couldn't have in the parade route.
[00:11:07.634 --> 00:11:11.295]  And of course, they just said, because I'm God, I'm the Caesar.
[00:11:11.915 --> 00:11:16.997]  Now it's because I'm your big, loving brother.
[00:11:17.017 --> 00:11:20.358]  I take care of you, my little brother, my little sister.
[00:11:22.469 --> 00:11:33.754]  And then I went to the Army's website and there were all these pictures of Ridge and Ashcroft and others with troops with machine guns all over D.C.
[00:11:34.195 --> 00:11:41.338]  Not just National Guard, which they can claim gets around posse commandatas, the federal law barring that, but regular Army.
[00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.557]  Here's Air Force Link website.
[00:11:45.577 --> 00:11:48.738]  Military Support Group prepares for Presidential Inauguration.
[00:11:48.778 --> 00:11:58.683]  A little-known group of sailors, soldiers, airmen, marines, and Coast Guardsmen is preparing to provide behind-the-scenes military support for Presidential Inaugural activities.
[00:11:59.063 --> 00:12:03.665]  The organization's Deputy Commander said here January 11th, or three days ago.
[00:12:04.582 --> 00:12:06.103]  Now, that's just one group.
[00:12:06.123 --> 00:12:11.145]  There's also the District of Columbia, Military Defense Force, and a bunch of others.
[00:12:11.585 --> 00:12:19.189]  The Joint Task Force, Armed Forces Inaugural Committee, provides all military ceremonial support for various 55 Presidential and Inaugural events.
[00:12:19.549 --> 00:12:20.750]  But this one's different.
[00:12:23.211 --> 00:12:27.974]  So they're careful on CNN and others to go, oh, it's behind the scenes, just advisory capacity.
[00:12:28.154 --> 00:12:28.594]  Oh, yes.
[00:12:29.294 --> 00:12:30.795]  Out with the tanks and machine guns.
[00:12:31.503 --> 00:12:48.210]  Ridge describes unprecedented security for Bush swearing in, and they're going to have the face scanning cameras, all of it, to keep our leader safe from their business partners, Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:48.791 --> 00:12:56.494]  And here is the army.mil website, Army Public Affairs subsection, Army News,
[00:12:57.447 --> 00:13:01.410]  Soldiers practice security for inauguration.
[00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:09.815]  Elements of the Joint Forces Headquarters National Capital Region gathered at the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
[00:13:10.155 --> 00:13:17.360]  to participate in a public demonstration of some of the biggest and best tools being used for security in the upcoming inauguration.
[00:13:18.425 --> 00:13:31.675]  Among those present for the event were Charles H. Ramsey, Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, Tom Ridge, Secretary of Homeland Security, and Major General Galen B. Jackman, Commander of the JFHQ.
[00:13:32.276 --> 00:13:34.818]  That was the guy running around on this giant map.
[00:13:35.438 --> 00:13:39.882]  Like, I don't know, 300 foot long map, 200 foot wide, of the city.
[00:13:40.382 --> 00:13:42.664]  A satellite image of the city walking around with
[00:13:43.263 --> 00:13:48.305]  With these pointers, laser lights shooting down from the ceiling about what we're going to do for you.
[00:13:49.065 --> 00:13:51.646]  Oh, larger than life, keeping us safe.
[00:13:52.186 --> 00:13:53.527]  Just such propaganda.
[00:13:55.608 --> 00:14:07.732]  And it gets into the soldiers from the Military District of Washington, members of the Metropolitan Police Department, Marines of Chemical Biological Incident Response Force Station at Indian Head, Maryland.
[00:14:09.566 --> 00:14:11.828]  And Ridge begins to give the seconding quotes.
[00:14:11.868 --> 00:14:12.828]  Listen to this carefully.
[00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:26.477]  It's important to note that the people and the organizations represented here in person and with this equipment have been working together for years and years, said Ridge during the press conference following the demonstration of the technologies.
[00:14:26.857 --> 00:14:32.101]  They work together all the time at all the events in the National Capital Region.
[00:14:33.005 --> 00:14:33.845]  Oh, the region.
[00:14:34.186 --> 00:14:39.267]  These organizations represent what the Department of Homeland Security tries to do nationally.
[00:14:39.808 --> 00:14:41.328]  Again, merging the military and police.
[00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:56.254]  Instead, Ridge, this is a quote, integrate capacities, abilities, and all jurisdictions because together they are an extremely strong force or total federalization under Homeland Security.
[00:14:58.007 --> 00:15:03.090]  And he goes in to talk about the merger of the Joint Task Force of the U.S.
[00:15:03.150 --> 00:15:14.137]  military, the National Capital Region, the Military District of Washington, the DCPD, the Armed Forces Committee.
[00:15:14.157 --> 00:15:16.619]  I mean, it goes on and on, folks.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:21.262]  And then they outlined the security.
[00:15:23.815 --> 00:15:40.784]  So in your face and there he is saying this is an example of what we're trying to do nationally when you have all your urban warfare drills and when you have the National Guard out assisting at checkpoints to look for drunk drivers or when they have a big thing like
[00:15:41.658 --> 00:15:46.081]  Fiesta weekend in San Antonio before 9-11.
[00:15:46.201 --> 00:15:50.523]  They had MPs out on the streets aiding the police.
[00:15:51.024 --> 00:15:51.284]  Why?
[00:15:51.324 --> 00:15:54.566]  You're not for riots or drunkenness, are you?
[00:15:54.726 --> 00:15:55.986]  Nothing happened, by the way.
[00:15:56.847 --> 00:16:00.329]  We got video of the troops out back in 2000.
[00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:03.851]  Everywhere this has been going on.
[00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:10.195]  In my film, The Road to Tyranny, we interview a Marine Corps officer, also a police officer,
[00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:17.633]  who quit the force, but he has a very successful business, that's all I'm going to say, here locally.
[00:16:17.673 --> 00:16:29.921]  But back in 1989, he was a Marine Corps commander kicking down doors in Virginia on drug and gun raids, including of gun dealers' homes.
[00:16:32.042 --> 00:16:36.385]  And it was a covert operation with Marines in police uniforms.
[00:16:37.703 --> 00:16:38.964]  Who weren't even police yet.
[00:16:39.124 --> 00:16:42.467]  Then later he got out of the Marine Corps and was a police officer for a while.
[00:16:42.487 --> 00:16:45.229]  Until he got into computers.
[00:16:45.289 --> 00:16:49.612]  But the point here is that this is in the late 80's.
[00:16:50.112 --> 00:16:54.996]  They had a secret operation going on all over the country that we've learned of.
[00:16:56.196 --> 00:17:03.802]  And I talked about it on air and was invited to this guy's home and he showed me the documents and photos and a lot of things we couldn't show in the film.
[00:17:05.501 --> 00:17:17.644]  But the reason he got mad and finally called me was he was driving up I-35 and saw the National Guard out searching people's vehicles with the police just randomly.
[00:17:18.304 --> 00:17:30.547]  And that was back in 2001 and he actually got stopped and was just shocked to have police and troops trying to search his vehicle.
[00:17:31.487 --> 00:17:33.808]  And you can see that interview with his face blurred out
[00:17:34.771 --> 00:17:42.175]  in the film, but he said it took him, and now middle-aged, all these years to finally start getting it.
[00:17:44.557 --> 00:17:46.378]  Again, that is in America, folks.
[00:17:47.138 --> 00:17:51.881]  And then now I hear police on local radio in Austin going, yeah, but there's no Fourth Amendment.
[00:17:52.842 --> 00:18:01.987]  The sheriff, Frazier, got up on TV and they raided a whole neighborhood and put guns in people's heads, made people sit down in fire ant beds, kicked people's dogs,
[00:18:02.971 --> 00:18:03.932]  No drugs found.
[00:18:04.132 --> 00:18:08.073]  They had some weeds in their backyard that literally are in about half the backyards.
[00:18:08.374 --> 00:18:10.294]  Well, it's every backyard.
[00:18:10.334 --> 00:18:11.255]  It's called bloodweed.
[00:18:11.895 --> 00:18:17.578]  If you have a big backyard and don't mow it, you know, in the back where it gets wild, you'll have bloodweed.
[00:18:19.078 --> 00:18:21.259]  And so they didn't find drugs at one house.
[00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:22.820]  They just said, we'll just search the neighborhood.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.462]  And Frazier got up on the news and said, we no longer need warrants.
[00:18:27.082 --> 00:18:27.682]  That was a quote.
[00:18:28.022 --> 00:18:29.143]  We don't need warrants anymore.
[00:18:30.242 --> 00:18:33.464]  And no, we're not going to apologize about doing this to this poor woman.
[00:18:35.686 --> 00:18:42.731]  By the way, we finally got her out of office, and so now she's going to go to Sam Houston University, the big law enforcement university.
[00:18:43.171 --> 00:18:45.913]  We've done stories on that where they teach the, we have the textbook.
[00:18:46.494 --> 00:18:54.720]  One of my good friends, Bob Dacey's son, a state police officer, when he went through it, this was about six years ago, five years ago,
[00:18:56.643 --> 00:19:03.206]  They told them in the textbook, there's no Constitution, no Bill of Rights, we're getting rid of juries, and we're going to work with foreign troops.
[00:19:03.326 --> 00:19:04.647]  I mean, this is in the textbooks.
[00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:05.587]  Do you understand?
[00:19:06.167 --> 00:19:07.268]  Do you understand?
[00:19:08.468 --> 00:19:09.589]  This is in the textbooks.
[00:19:11.009 --> 00:19:13.390]  This is what America has turned into.
[00:19:14.451 --> 00:19:16.012]  And again, but it's for your safety.
[00:19:16.052 --> 00:19:23.915]  With the borders wide open, and every terror group we track down is funded by the CIA, or Mossad, or MI6, or the FSB.
[00:19:26.349 --> 00:19:27.310]  I mean in every case.
[00:19:28.050 --> 00:19:31.373]  Alright, I said we go to calls and we'll get to your calls in the next segment.
[00:19:32.974 --> 00:19:36.417]  Jack and John and Joe and everybody else.
[00:19:36.437 --> 00:19:37.918]  1-800-259-9231 World Government is upon us!
[00:19:37.938 --> 00:19:43.823]  Why do they want to track and trace and control us so badly?
[00:19:51.266 --> 00:19:58.430]  Because they've got an economic plan for you that they know you're going to revolt against.
[00:20:01.312 --> 00:20:07.176]  Hey, I'll tell you, I have lost over 40 pounds with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, and my energy level is just incredible.
[00:20:07.216 --> 00:20:08.937]  With me is Carla Jarrett from Vim and Vigor.
[00:20:09.177 --> 00:20:11.038]  Hey, last weekend, I helped my neighbor move.
[00:20:11.338 --> 00:20:13.099]  It took maybe three hours to move in boxes.
[00:20:13.419 --> 00:20:17.162]  Then I mowed the lawn, which I never would have done before I lost that 40 pounds.
[00:20:17.222 --> 00:20:20.384]  And then after that, I went ahead and did my 20 minutes of cardio.
[00:20:21.485 --> 00:20:25.606]  My wife actually mentioned that she was kind of amazed that I did all of that and just kind of kept going.
[00:20:25.906 --> 00:20:29.347]  Well, that's great, and just as a reminder, there's no stimulants in Collagenate.
[00:20:29.407 --> 00:20:29.607]  Right.
[00:20:29.627 --> 00:20:34.549]  So it's not that you're taking stimulants, it's more that you, because you've lost weight, you have more energy and you're feeling better.
[00:20:34.749 --> 00:20:35.149]  Absolutely.
[00:20:35.189 --> 00:20:40.611]  I'm sleeping better, I feel better during the day, I don't get as tired in the afternoons, and I'm able to do a lot more.
[00:20:40.751 --> 00:20:45.432]  Collagenate is safe, it's natural, it's healthy, and it's helped me to lose over 40 pounds now.
[00:20:45.592 --> 00:20:47.573]  Call and order Vim and Vigor's Collagenate 1-800-6222-THIN.

[00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:23.233]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:22:23.493 --> 00:22:29.259]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[00:22:53.757 --> 00:22:55.618]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:23:05.626 --> 00:23:09.109]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:23:09.710 --> 00:23:13.233]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:23:13.913 --> 00:23:16.516]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:23:16.936 --> 00:23:19.358]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:23:19.879 --> 00:23:21.300]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.722]  Is your life on hold to the spring?
[00:23:24.262 --> 00:23:25.223]  Check with your doctor.
[00:23:25.323 --> 00:23:30.228]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SADS, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:23:30.688 --> 00:23:31.589]  In all likelihood,
[00:23:32.014 --> 00:23:35.416]  Your doctor will recommend Bright Light Therapy with one of our special lights.

[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:12.741]  Alright, let's go to John and Jeff and Mike and Steven and others.
[00:24:13.782 --> 00:24:21.245]  Then I'll plunge back into all the news as America is turned into the most high-tech police state in history.
[00:24:22.606 --> 00:24:28.468]  As the world is swept by scientifically crafted dehumanization.
[00:24:29.729 --> 00:24:32.230]  But hey, who cares, because the football game's on.
[00:24:32.730 --> 00:24:35.031]  John in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:24:35.051 --> 00:24:35.932]  Hello, Alex.
[00:24:36.472 --> 00:24:36.692]  Hello.
[00:24:37.711 --> 00:24:39.492]  We're talking about Oklahoma City yesterday.
[00:24:39.512 --> 00:24:39.572]  Yes.
[00:24:40.192 --> 00:24:49.276]  And one of the things that tipped me off that something wasn't right about that is the fact that Tim McVeigh went halfway across Oklahoma City without a license plate on his car.
[00:24:49.956 --> 00:24:56.198]  When the day he arrested and they said that he didn't have a plate on there, I said, well, any fool knows that any first cop you come across is going to arrest you.
[00:24:58.259 --> 00:24:59.339]  And it sounds awful strange.
[00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:01.460]  Not that many people want to talk about that.
[00:25:03.181 --> 00:25:05.602]  Well, you know what the Daily Oklahoman reported.
[00:25:06.437 --> 00:25:06.637]  No.
[00:25:06.818 --> 00:25:11.906]  The state police said that when they pulled him over, he said, I've got a gun under the seat.
[00:25:12.867 --> 00:25:16.052]  He fell to the ground and said, make it stop, oh the chip.
[00:25:16.573 --> 00:25:18.096]  The chip in my buttocks.
[00:25:18.656 --> 00:25:19.277]  They made me.
[00:25:19.538 --> 00:25:20.119]  They made me.
[00:25:21.421 --> 00:25:31.606]  And he probably didn't have a chip, but under torture they say key words to you, and then they torture you until you have a compulsion to do something.
[00:25:32.286 --> 00:25:41.691]  And folks, for those that doubt this, it was even in the mainstream news, Jolly and West, who came out in the 1977 MKUltra CIA Mind Control hearings in Congress,
[00:25:42.291 --> 00:25:52.220]  That was his personal government psychiatrist who stayed with him from the time he was arrested off and on until he was executed, always by his side.
[00:25:53.161 --> 00:25:55.684]  And again, that's your patching.
[00:25:55.704 --> 00:26:07.855]  They get somebody tortured to live in daylights out of them, mind control them up real good, and then just activate the mind control program that makes them go to pieces at the key time.
[00:26:08.934 --> 00:26:12.617]  Oh, the state police said he was also drooling profusely.
[00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:17.721]  He just packed an ammonium nitrate bomb that would normally blow up before you even got it there.
[00:26:18.221 --> 00:26:25.446]  He just packed it full of all this, but he just gets pulled over and he's drooling saying, I've got a chip.
[00:26:25.466 --> 00:26:27.548]  It was definitely a setup.
[00:26:28.266 --> 00:26:28.626]  Day one.
[00:26:28.926 --> 00:26:30.787]  Well, I mean, let's talk about what's admitted.
[00:26:31.188 --> 00:26:37.511]  Congress admits that this top BATF officer practiced blowing up seven different car and truck bombs out in the desert.
[00:26:37.991 --> 00:26:41.273]  He just didn't live in Oklahoma, but he happened to be in Oklahoma City that morning, there.
[00:26:41.633 --> 00:26:46.376]  And he's the guy that called the media within ten minutes saying it's an AMFO bomb.
[00:26:47.056 --> 00:26:55.961]  And then Danny Colson, one of the top FBI hostage rescue team commanders, claimed that he was in Dallas when it happened, but hotel receipts show that he was in Oklahoma City.
[00:26:56.661 --> 00:26:57.502]  This is all public.
[00:26:58.876 --> 00:26:59.976]  It's a coincidence, though.
[00:27:00.397 --> 00:27:01.157]  It's a coincidence.
[00:27:01.458 --> 00:27:12.746]  That it's a coincidence that it was under a National Security Council operation, just like the sting on the World Trade Center the first time was, where the FBI cooked the bomb and trained the driver and let it happen.
[00:27:13.956 --> 00:27:17.638]  Uh, and when their own informants said, let's bust them, they said, no, we're gonna let it go forward.
[00:27:17.999 --> 00:27:24.922]  Just like on 9-11, the drills of flying hijacked jets into buildings that the CIA was running at the exact same time it happened.
[00:27:24.942 --> 00:27:29.025]  Uh, it just so happened that was the National Security Council running that, too.
[00:27:29.065 --> 00:27:30.125]  They're very friendly people.
[00:27:32.487 --> 00:27:33.247]  That's all I got, eh?
[00:27:34.008 --> 00:27:35.548]  Thank you, good to hear from you, John.
[00:27:35.649 --> 00:27:36.629]  Jeff in Texas.
[00:27:36.709 --> 00:27:37.450]  Jeff, go ahead.
[00:27:40.551 --> 00:27:41.652]  Yeah, Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:27:42.637 --> 00:27:43.418]  Okay, bye-bye.
[00:27:44.318 --> 00:27:45.279]  Mike in Ohio.
[00:27:45.359 --> 00:27:46.079]  Mike, go ahead.
[00:27:46.099 --> 00:27:48.361]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:27:48.501 --> 00:27:49.202]  Good, I'm alright.
[00:27:49.222 --> 00:27:49.702]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:27:49.862 --> 00:27:52.524]  I'd like to find out, what happened to Clay Douglas?
[00:27:52.604 --> 00:27:53.885]  Is he recovering from his injuries?
[00:27:54.365 --> 00:27:55.026]  Yeah, he is.
[00:27:55.226 --> 00:27:55.986]  That's good to hear.
[00:27:56.026 --> 00:27:56.807]  He's my favorite.
[00:27:57.027 --> 00:27:58.808]  Is he back on radio?
[00:27:59.849 --> 00:28:00.529]  I believe so.
[00:28:00.689 --> 00:28:01.770]  How is your health holding up?
[00:28:03.211 --> 00:28:03.591]  Pardon me, sir?
[00:28:03.611 --> 00:28:04.632]  How is your health holding up?
[00:28:05.172 --> 00:28:05.693]  Oh, great!
[00:28:05.773 --> 00:28:06.273]  Thank you.
[00:28:06.313 --> 00:28:07.054]  I'm glad to hear that.
[00:28:07.094 --> 00:28:07.834]  How is your health?
[00:28:07.854 --> 00:28:08.975]  Oh, fair.
[00:28:09.335 --> 00:28:10.116]  How's your family?
[00:28:10.656 --> 00:28:11.097]  Oh, fair.
[00:28:11.137 --> 00:28:11.677]  We've got a lot of
[00:28:12.515 --> 00:28:14.897]  Outstanding illnesses and injuries we're recovering from.
[00:28:14.917 --> 00:28:21.121]  I've got to look through your collagen aid for some help for weight problems.
[00:28:21.502 --> 00:28:22.623]  How's your lawn doing?
[00:28:24.604 --> 00:28:26.485]  It's growing what you said, in the backyard.
[00:28:26.506 --> 00:28:28.687]  Oh, it's growing those bloodweeds.
[00:28:28.727 --> 00:28:29.127]  Yeah.
[00:28:29.648 --> 00:28:31.749]  Well, they're going to have to swap team you, I guess.
[00:28:31.829 --> 00:28:32.590]  I know, I know.
[00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:41.737]  Hey, I was researching on the autism projects, and I'm astounded how many people in this area are not aware of what's going on in the vaccine program.
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:52.543]  Well, autism is up several thousand percent from 1 in 25,000 20 years ago to 1 in 1,000 and the new numbers are coming out.
[00:28:52.563 --> 00:28:54.624]  It looks like it's going to be 1 in 168.
[00:28:54.764 --> 00:29:03.867]  I had people years ago warn me about these things that were going to happen, like through vaccine programs, and I didn't believe it, but I'm believing it now.
[00:29:05.123 --> 00:29:07.185]  Well, the government wouldn't hurt you.
[00:29:07.225 --> 00:29:10.447]  I mean, their own official plan says they want to kill 80% of us.
[00:29:10.907 --> 00:29:14.770]  And they've been caught ordering the third world to sterilize their women.
[00:29:15.330 --> 00:29:17.432]  And they've been caught developing AIDS virus.
[00:29:17.452 --> 00:29:18.953]  That's now mainstream news in Europe.
[00:29:19.433 --> 00:29:23.596]  And they've been caught spraying nerve gas on American citizens all over the country and killing people.
[00:29:23.896 --> 00:29:25.518]  And killing people on the New York subway in 68.
[00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:28.920]  Let's just start trusting them, Jeff.
[00:29:30.041 --> 00:29:34.544]  Are there certain parts of the country they can keep ignorant about that and others they don't?
[00:29:35.484 --> 00:29:37.065]  Well, no, anybody can find out about it.
[00:29:37.085 --> 00:29:40.727]  I'm saying, it seems like certain areas where I talk to people, it's like they're oblivious.
[00:29:41.187 --> 00:29:43.128]  They're going about their everyday lives.
[00:29:43.168 --> 00:29:45.749]  They don't seem to be having an idea.
[00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:47.490]  Well, maybe they're good and we're bad.
[00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:48.350]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.652 --> 00:29:52.572]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.032 --> 00:29:54.653]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.554 --> 00:29:58.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.249 --> 00:30:07.493]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:30:07.634 --> 00:30:13.798]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[00:30:14.078 --> 00:30:22.504]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:30:22.764 --> 00:30:29.789]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:30:30.069 --> 00:30:34.912]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:30:35.112 --> 00:30:40.536]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:30:40.876 --> 00:30:43.958]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:30:44.279 --> 00:30:52.244]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:52.284 --> 00:30:52.864]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:04.851]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[00:31:05.031 --> 00:31:07.752]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[00:31:07.932 --> 00:31:09.333]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[00:31:09.493 --> 00:31:19.436]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-rigging work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[00:31:19.616 --> 00:31:21.357]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[00:31:21.637 --> 00:31:25.519]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[00:31:25.739 --> 00:31:30.141]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[00:31:30.362 --> 00:31:34.203]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's EasyTurn gear system.
[00:31:34.444 --> 00:31:40.647]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[00:31:40.827 --> 00:31:43.628]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[00:31:43.808 --> 00:31:47.170]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle one-year money-back guarantee.
[00:31:47.250 --> 00:31:51.052]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[00:31:51.232 --> 00:31:52.435]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:31:52.595 --> 00:31:52.996]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:32:01.684 --> 00:32:03.185]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.265 --> 00:32:05.646]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:32:06.007 --> 00:32:06.887]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:32:07.247 --> 00:32:08.468]  Oil War III has started.
[00:32:08.788 --> 00:32:11.210]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:15.072]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:15.452 --> 00:32:16.293]  Why else would the U.S.
[00:32:16.313 --> 00:32:19.274]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:32:19.535 --> 00:32:20.795]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:32:21.256 --> 00:32:25.718]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:32:26.159 --> 00:32:30.141]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:32:30.661 --> 00:32:36.545]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[00:32:36.825 --> 00:32:42.929]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:44.010]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:49.674]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:32:50.114 --> 00:32:52.756]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[00:32:52.976 --> 00:32:53.296]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:33:03.913 --> 00:33:09.917]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.537 --> 00:33:13.499]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.362 --> 00:33:20.463]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:21.363 --> 00:33:23.825]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:25.004 --> 00:33:27.066]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:27.086 --> 00:33:27.886]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:28.386 --> 00:33:30.488]  Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:31.008 --> 00:33:45.278]  Before we go back to Steve and Joe and Cliff and Dorothy and everybody else on this Live Friday edition, before the last break slammed into us, I just mentioned our government that kills us with nerve gas.
[00:33:47.399 --> 00:33:52.883]  Folks, there were multiple congressional hearings, there were hundreds of declassified documents
[00:33:54.628 --> 00:34:03.053]  Born in New York, San Francisco, South Texas, Idaho, just all over the place, Alaska.
[00:34:04.854 --> 00:34:19.942]  The government would fly over with helicopters or planes, spray out nerve gas, release plague, bubonic plague, just type in plague bombs used on Scotland and BBC and
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:35.348]  Reuters will pop up, you know, where they just bomb people with a bubonic plague, and they send in a few dozen of the small-town army doctors who act like they're, you know, from the regular government, just there to help.
[00:34:35.408 --> 00:34:36.689]  And, oh, what's the sickness?
[00:34:36.769 --> 00:34:39.871]  And they don't give people treatment, and watch how they get sick.
[00:34:39.891 --> 00:34:42.152]  I mean, they'll just kill you!
[00:34:42.272 --> 00:34:43.093]  They'll kill me!
[00:34:45.379 --> 00:34:53.724]  And they find these scientists and these individuals, usually with high IQs, and the argument's, well, we've got to get prepared for this to happen, so we've got to go ahead and test it in the real world.
[00:34:53.764 --> 00:34:56.926]  It'll save millions if it really happens.
[00:34:58.527 --> 00:35:02.449]  But really, it's about engineering and gearing up to do this to the mass of us.
[00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:06.732]  1968, New York subway, one of the most famous examples.
[00:35:06.772 --> 00:35:10.554]  Just type into a search engine and you'll get popular mechanics and
[00:35:11.932 --> 00:35:15.674]  For Popular Science, you'll get AP, you'll get all these articles.
[00:35:15.714 --> 00:35:22.118]  Just type in, uh, Biological Weapon Released by Government in New York Subway.
[00:35:23.078 --> 00:35:24.819]  Type something like that into a search engine.
[00:35:27.521 --> 00:35:28.401]  And you'll read about it.
[00:35:28.762 --> 00:35:38.287]  And people were going to work, they had their children with them, back in 1968, getting on the subways, and they had little time release light bulbs that released an unnamed bio-weapon.
[00:35:39.176 --> 00:35:43.337]  A lot of you folks died, but details remain classified of just how many.
[00:35:43.377 --> 00:35:46.658]  And, you know, just children, old women, men, women.
[00:35:47.118 --> 00:35:48.318]  Just people going to work.
[00:35:48.338 --> 00:35:49.638]  We're just gonna kill you!
[00:35:49.658 --> 00:35:50.378]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:35:50.898 --> 00:35:52.699]  We love you!
[00:35:53.279 --> 00:35:55.519]  Give your rights up to us or Al Qaeda will get you.
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.380]  And again, you're a cop driving down the road right now.
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:02.861]  You're a BATF officer.
[00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:04.981]  You're a lawyer.
[00:36:05.041 --> 00:36:06.082]  You're a prosecutor.
[00:36:06.102 --> 00:36:07.482]  And you're going, that ain't true.
[00:36:08.423 --> 00:36:18.011]  Okay, well, just when you get home tonight, go to the big search engine, and type in biological testing, U.S.
[00:36:18.031 --> 00:36:22.615]  government biochem testing, or try NBC, U.S.
[00:36:22.655 --> 00:36:27.419]  government NBC testing, nuclear, chemical, biological, on the American people.
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:33.243]  And you'll get thousands of links, thousands of mainstream news articles.
[00:36:34.104 --> 00:36:37.607]  And you go, well, the government's so evil, what do you mean mainstream news articles?
[00:36:38.726 --> 00:36:39.667]  Why would it be out there?
[00:36:40.167 --> 00:36:47.333]  Well, over the years, it comes out here, it comes out there, back of the paper, and they'll usually report it like it's no big deal.
[00:36:47.934 --> 00:36:52.958]  Well, they had the young army sergeant who was gung-ho.
[00:36:52.998 --> 00:36:58.462]  They asked him, we just signed this form to let us test some chemicals on you.
[00:36:58.482 --> 00:36:59.583]  They're totally harmless.
[00:36:59.623 --> 00:37:01.044]  We just want to test them.
[00:37:01.425 --> 00:37:01.945]  Oh, sure.
[00:37:01.965 --> 00:37:06.709]  And they put them in the chamber and nerve gas them, and they die, and then they tuck their body up and dissect it.
[00:37:07.981 --> 00:37:09.803]  Of course, that's on the good end of things.
[00:37:09.843 --> 00:37:14.707]  You know, at least they said it's some type of testing we're doing before they killed him.
[00:37:16.628 --> 00:37:30.080]  Or before, in 1985, in Wales, at an army testing ground in England, US and British troops were nerve gassed with sarin nerve gas as one of the last tests of Project Shad.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:34.443]  I ought to get Dr. Rocky back on about that.
[00:37:36.963 --> 00:37:43.829]  Army top expert, Colonel Rocky, on Shad and the DU and the rest of it.
[00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:51.335]  And some of the guys died that day, some of the others got sick later and died, and many others have big health problems from it.
[00:37:51.575 --> 00:37:58.641]  We've interviewed the sailors on board the ships where they fly over it 500 feet with jets and spray them with anthrax.
[00:38:00.622 --> 00:38:02.544]  It's a lot of love!
[00:38:05.103 --> 00:38:07.704]  Let's turn our firearms into the government.
[00:38:09.844 --> 00:38:11.204]  Let's submit to them.
[00:38:12.004 --> 00:38:14.245]  Let's just believe whatever they tell us.
[00:38:14.605 --> 00:38:17.706]  They wouldn't kill 3,000 people on 9-11.
[00:38:18.646 --> 00:38:19.706]  They're nice.
[00:38:22.187 --> 00:38:29.428]  But there's other cases in San Francisco and in Anchorage, Alaska, where they just fly over and spray you.
[00:38:30.168 --> 00:38:33.429]  And see, the fun part about this is, now with the new drone
[00:38:34.698 --> 00:38:41.502]  Wings of aircraft, the drone bombers, the drone fighters, the drone surveillance pods.
[00:38:42.263 --> 00:38:45.345]  By 2010, half the Air Force will be drone controlled.
[00:38:46.205 --> 00:38:48.307]  You're not even going to have pilots controlling these.
[00:38:48.347 --> 00:38:54.310]  You can have individuals with pre-set flight plans and computer programs for the tiny cabal of globalists.
[00:38:55.431 --> 00:38:58.113]  It won't matter if their own military won't follow orders.
[00:38:59.477 --> 00:39:03.760]  It wouldn't matter if our own military wouldn't nuke a city and then blame it on some foreign enemy.
[00:39:04.101 --> 00:39:10.306]  Because they can have a drone take off from private contractor's base with that bomb.
[00:39:11.406 --> 00:39:13.408]  And it can fly right over and drop it.
[00:39:13.428 --> 00:39:18.712]  And it won't matter how many witnesses see a plane drop a bomb, they'll tell you Al-Qaeda detonated it on the ground.
[00:39:20.513 --> 00:39:23.536]  We can have firefighters saying they saw the bombs in the towers.
[00:39:24.517 --> 00:39:26.958]  They can tell People Magazine that.
[00:39:26.999 --> 00:39:27.519]  Doesn't matter.
[00:39:30.586 --> 00:39:34.348]  It's what the government tells you the official story is.
[00:39:35.769 --> 00:39:36.929]  So, this is the freedom.
[00:39:39.991 --> 00:39:41.972]  And this is why they're so arrogant.
[00:39:42.012 --> 00:39:43.253]  This is the new freedom.
[00:39:43.293 --> 00:39:44.773]  The forced psychological testing.
[00:39:44.793 --> 00:39:45.534]  The forced drugging.
[00:39:45.554 --> 00:39:47.095]  The face scanning cameras everywhere.
[00:39:47.415 --> 00:39:48.856]  Thumb scanning to buy and sell.
[00:39:49.296 --> 00:39:50.637]  World ID cards.
[00:39:50.717 --> 00:39:51.737]  Ridge is now announcing.
[00:39:54.819 --> 00:39:56.179]  This is the new freedom, folks.
[00:39:56.239 --> 00:39:58.821]  Being arrested as a terrorist for complaining too much.
[00:40:00.052 --> 00:40:09.863]  Or selling knockoff Rubik's Cubes, or selling a half ounce of marijuana, or paying off a politician for zoning for parking spaces.
[00:40:10.324 --> 00:40:11.185]  You know the drill.
[00:40:13.107 --> 00:40:14.368]  This is the new terrorism.
[00:40:14.388 --> 00:40:16.751]  We're all terrorists, but the terrorists.
[00:40:17.191 --> 00:40:20.475]  The only people that aren't terrorists are terrorists.
[00:40:24.232 --> 00:40:38.724]  That's what tyranny is, my friends, is when the criminals, the people that enjoy the exercise of power, the people who never get enough, who always want more, who are control freaks, get into control.
[00:40:40.165 --> 00:40:50.494]  And then they get their hands on the levers of the PR firms and the public relations systems, the space age propaganda instruments,
[00:40:51.838 --> 00:41:03.442]  And you've got a decadent population that had plenty and who was well off because we used to have liberty so that produced plenty.
[00:41:04.442 --> 00:41:15.966]  You have a decadent population swigging whiskey and guzzling beer and eating cheeseburgers 24-7, watching football, strutting around wearing t-shirts about how tough they are.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:20.180]  Bugging their eyes out, mindlessly.
[00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:22.361]  Don't even know how many states there are.
[00:41:22.441 --> 00:41:24.561]  Can't tell you ten state capitals.
[00:41:25.321 --> 00:41:27.082]  Don't know how many people live in Canada.
[00:41:27.282 --> 00:41:28.842]  Don't know the history of Mexico.
[00:41:28.882 --> 00:41:29.962]  Don't know anything about Europe.
[00:41:30.162 --> 00:41:31.863]  Don't know the Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[00:41:32.023 --> 00:41:34.923]  Don't even know who their great-grandfather or great-grandmother were.
[00:41:35.704 --> 00:41:36.904]  Never read a history book.
[00:41:37.124 --> 00:41:39.264]  Literal drooling idiots.
[00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:41.425]  Breeding.
[00:41:41.545 --> 00:41:42.405]  Taking over.
[00:41:43.160 --> 00:41:55.631]  And then there's this huge swath of us that are awake and involved, but either we're tied into fake right-wing politics or fake left-wing politics, so it's even a smaller portion of those that are involved that really know what the real paradigm is.
[00:41:55.651 --> 00:42:03.398]  I mean, we have a government that did 1,300 tests.
[00:42:08.027 --> 00:42:14.709]  of chemicals, biologicals, radiologicals, by the time it came out in the late seventies in the hearings.
[00:42:16.730 --> 00:42:18.070]  And now a lot of other documents.
[00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:23.172]  You see, the government has billions of documents, and they're always declassifying new ones.
[00:42:23.192 --> 00:42:25.053]  Just whole stacks get declassified.
[00:42:25.353 --> 00:42:28.194]  People get lazy and don't review them properly, so they get released.
[00:42:28.754 --> 00:42:35.076]  Bush is now reclassifying masses of stuff that was already public.
[00:42:36.261 --> 00:42:41.447]  Stuff that was already released, already in the back of the newspaper, already on the National Security Archives website.
[00:42:41.827 --> 00:42:48.594]  Now they're trying to claim you can be a terrorist if you have documents that were declassified 10, 20, 30 years ago.
[00:42:49.695 --> 00:42:51.677]  See, a new dark age is dawning.
[00:42:52.438 --> 00:42:54.120]  A new age of wickedness.
[00:42:57.176 --> 00:43:06.339]  And the Christian conservatives, the fake Christian conservatives, suck their thumbs in a catatonic state, going, George Bush is a prophet!
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.240]  He is a disciple!
[00:43:11.041 --> 00:43:12.061]  All is well!
[00:43:12.161 --> 00:43:16.643]  And you tell them, well, he's banning crosses anywhere in the parade route.
[00:43:17.259 --> 00:43:20.762]  Well, he's putting people in office and federal judgeships.
[00:43:20.862 --> 00:43:22.204]  Went after Roy Moore.
[00:43:22.864 --> 00:43:24.926]  Well, he's doing all of this.
[00:43:25.226 --> 00:43:26.968]  Oh, shut up, communist!
[00:43:29.790 --> 00:43:31.652]  See, you bought the Trojan horse, didn't you?
[00:43:32.392 --> 00:43:33.633]  You bought a hook, line, and sinker.
[00:43:33.653 --> 00:43:36.195]  I don't want to hear from the liberals that call in and go, See?
[00:43:36.316 --> 00:43:37.517]  Kerry would have saved us.
[00:43:37.797 --> 00:43:39.398]  It was all staged.
[00:43:39.879 --> 00:43:44.483]  And unless we face the cold, hard facts, the cold, hard truth.
[00:43:44.543 --> 00:43:47.385]  I mean, I don't want people to psychologically evade me on this.
[00:43:48.026 --> 00:43:59.476]  People who serve the establishment, who feel like they're part of the power structure, don't giggle, don't make excuses, don't turn the radio off, you know, don't play games with yourself.
[00:44:00.902 --> 00:44:03.184]  This has to do with your future and your children's future.
[00:44:03.444 --> 00:44:04.085]  And humanity.
[00:44:04.685 --> 00:44:05.806]  Your immediate future.
[00:44:06.306 --> 00:44:09.048]  Not just the long term or intermediate term future.
[00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:17.274]  There is a global elite running things that openly will nerve gas children for fun.
[00:44:18.976 --> 00:44:24.199]  Our own government, when they were doing uranium and plutonium tests in the 40's and 50's.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.401]  It's far worse now.
[00:44:28.172 --> 00:44:44.015]  Really, just to test their personnel and see what they can get away with, you'd have a GI, and his wife would be going to the base for medical treatment, care, pregnant, happy family, six months pregnant, looking forward to that baby.
[00:44:45.175 --> 00:44:48.295]  There were hundreds of these cases that have been declassified, by the way.
[00:44:49.056 --> 00:44:53.036]  And the Army doctor would say, Hi sweetie, I've got a little something for you.
[00:44:53.296 --> 00:44:56.097]  I want you to take these prenatal vitamins.
[00:44:56.117 --> 00:44:56.957]  Will you do that for me?
[00:44:58.143 --> 00:44:58.944]  Well, sure, doctor.
[00:44:59.004 --> 00:44:59.964]  Thank you for caring.
[00:45:00.045 --> 00:45:01.085]  Oh, you bet I care.
[00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:07.811]  You bet I care, sweetie pie.
[00:45:08.231 --> 00:45:08.952]  Yes.
[00:45:09.452 --> 00:45:10.593]  That's the real spirit of it.
[00:45:11.434 --> 00:45:13.755]  And she goes home and starts taking them.
[00:45:13.795 --> 00:45:16.818]  And a few days later, something real bad happens.
[00:45:18.399 --> 00:45:21.341]  She goes back into the hospital, see, because that's where she gets her care.
[00:45:21.401 --> 00:45:23.083]  And they go, you don't mind?
[00:45:23.343 --> 00:45:25.465]  We're going to roll in some 35 millimeter and 16 millimeter
[00:45:28.277 --> 00:45:30.278]  Film cameras.
[00:45:31.058 --> 00:45:32.379]  And we're going to tape this.
[00:45:34.119 --> 00:45:39.621]  You see, you weren't going to be told until a decade later, but we killed your baby.
[00:45:40.882 --> 00:45:45.423]  And your hair is going to fall out now, and your teeth are going to fall out, and you're going to die too.
[00:45:45.443 --> 00:45:51.866]  Because we're testing uranium and plutonium poisoning on you!
[00:45:53.426 --> 00:45:55.767]  And you know, the sick thing about all this is,
[00:45:56.434 --> 00:46:00.137]  There's a lot of people listening who are World War II, Korean War, Vietnam Vets.
[00:46:00.197 --> 00:46:01.278]  I get their emails occasionally.
[00:46:01.518 --> 00:46:07.643]  Most of them have woke up, but some of them email me, You know, America's good, and this is a good country, and you need to leave it, bud!
[00:46:08.784 --> 00:46:10.965]  And I email them back and go, but is it true?
[00:46:11.966 --> 00:46:14.908]  Is it, sir, I used to do this, I don't even do it anymore.
[00:46:15.108 --> 00:46:16.890]  Here's three links to mainstream news.
[00:46:17.705 --> 00:46:24.248]  Where, uh, just where they quietly announced they killed women and their children, their unborn babies with uranium and plutonium.
[00:46:24.688 --> 00:46:25.729]  Uh, would you please respond?
[00:46:26.169 --> 00:46:29.110]  And then the, uh, email comes back with a profanity.
[00:46:30.011 --> 00:46:31.992]  I'm sorry, I didn't kill the babies!
[00:46:33.072 --> 00:46:34.193]  I didn't kill the women!
[00:46:35.173 --> 00:46:37.494]  I didn't nerve gas the people!
[00:46:39.796 --> 00:46:40.516]  I didn't do it!
[00:46:42.026 --> 00:46:44.748]  I didn't do any of it, and I'm sorry I told you about it.
[00:46:44.969 --> 00:46:55.298]  And I know in your junior high mentality mind that you think if somebody tells you about something that as soon as it comes into your mind it then exists, but it didn't exist until you knew about it.
[00:46:56.739 --> 00:47:00.863]  This is a very toddler-like, child-like worldview.
[00:47:01.223 --> 00:47:07.008]  The world does not revolve around you, and just because you don't know something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.
[00:47:07.631 --> 00:47:22.444]  Just because you're walking through a field, and there's a pit, a hundred foot pit in front of you, and you're gonna fall into it and break your neck, and bash your little brains out, just because it's dark and you don't see that pit, doesn't mean it's there!
[00:47:23.205 --> 00:47:25.067]  And I'm very angry about this!
[00:47:27.369 --> 00:47:30.772]  And it's time for you to get it through your heads!
[00:47:33.462 --> 00:47:41.887]  I don't care if you live in a ten million dollar house and you're driving a big old M2 Hummer or whatever they're called down the road right now.
[00:47:43.248 --> 00:47:48.511]  I don't care if you go to Republican or Democratic dinners and, you know, VPs pat you on the head.
[00:47:51.373 --> 00:47:56.236]  The globalists don't care about you and this whole illusion is getting ready to end.
[00:47:56.816 --> 00:48:02.360]  The people that have been setting up this evil for a long time are lining up all the pieces of the puzzle.
[00:48:03.177 --> 00:48:05.678]  To bring us into the next level of high-tech tyranny!
[00:48:05.998 --> 00:48:07.818]  And believe me, you're not gonna like it!
[00:48:09.519 --> 00:48:15.220]  Now we've got a chance to stop this, if we just have the courage to face the truth, and to get involved!
[00:48:16.521 --> 00:48:17.441]  Let's go to calls quickly.
[00:48:17.721 --> 00:48:19.162]  I just, I had to do that rant.
[00:48:19.882 --> 00:48:22.122]  Uh, I guess up next here is Steve in Pennsylvania.
[00:48:22.142 --> 00:48:22.843]  Steve, go ahead.
[00:48:23.183 --> 00:48:24.063]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:48:24.423 --> 00:48:24.783]  Welcome.
[00:48:25.383 --> 00:48:28.544]  Uh, I just found some, uh, interesting information.
[00:48:28.724 --> 00:48:30.685]  Uh, I found two, uh, documentary channels.
[00:48:31.165 --> 00:48:31.265]  Um,
[00:48:31.952 --> 00:48:36.094]  One was DTMS, and it's not on yet.
[00:48:36.174 --> 00:48:38.095]  They have America's Secret Soldiers.
[00:48:38.695 --> 00:48:39.895]  This was made last year.
[00:48:39.915 --> 00:48:43.457]  I think it was May of last year.
[00:48:44.157 --> 00:48:45.558]  Documentary on Secret Soldiers.
[00:48:45.578 --> 00:48:46.038]  Yes, yes.
[00:48:46.078 --> 00:48:46.478]  Secret.
[00:48:46.778 --> 00:48:47.298]  Tell me about it.
[00:48:47.959 --> 00:48:57.242]  What it says on the information is that classified military forces must operate in an environment requiring expertise beyond a traditional combat mission.
[00:48:57.883 --> 00:48:58.503]  It's a special.
[00:48:59.306 --> 00:49:01.807]  And down below that one, they have the Military Channel.
[00:49:02.067 --> 00:49:03.347]  I never even knew that was there.
[00:49:04.407 --> 00:49:07.188]  Um, they have Battle Plan on, uh, tomorrow night.
[00:49:08.008 --> 00:49:20.570]  And the Battle Plan, uh, I don't even know what this word means, um, it had this description, uh, technology revolution makes the modern Blitzkrieg possible.
[00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:22.831]  Uh, Episode Blitzkrieg.
[00:49:23.171 --> 00:49:24.151]  Uh, they produced, uh,
[00:49:25.034 --> 00:49:26.355]  January 11th of 2005.
[00:49:26.615 --> 00:49:31.959]  Well, I mean, MSNBC came out Monday and said that our troops are being trained to torture.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:33.341]  They said it was great, by the way.
[00:49:34.021 --> 00:49:36.403]  And to kidnap and bomb.
[00:49:37.164 --> 00:49:39.465]  So everything the terrorists do, they even wore the black mask.
[00:49:40.866 --> 00:49:46.551]  Last night, I watched a segment on, like you're mentioning, how the military's going to be coming home.
[00:49:46.591 --> 00:49:50.314]  They're going to be our, pretty much, law enforcement.
[00:49:50.334 --> 00:49:51.935]  They had a segment on last night.
[00:49:52.175 --> 00:49:53.596]  I think it was Dota Force Company 1.
[00:49:55.508 --> 00:50:01.910]  They were going around over in Iraq and they were helping supposedly... They were showing Squadron One on TV?
[00:50:01.970 --> 00:50:02.130]  Yeah.
[00:50:02.891 --> 00:50:05.992]  Yeah, they had... It should be on today, too.
[00:50:06.132 --> 00:50:09.393]  But anyway, they were going around with the police over there.
[00:50:09.413 --> 00:50:10.793]  The supposed police.
[00:50:11.653 --> 00:50:15.115]  And they busted somebody for... I don't know what they actually did.
[00:50:15.915 --> 00:50:22.417]  But what their police over there were doing... I mean, when they caught somebody, they were beating them up.
[00:50:23.590 --> 00:50:25.972]  And the military, they said they couldn't do nothing.
[00:50:25.992 --> 00:50:27.734]  They just stood there and supervised.
[00:50:28.714 --> 00:50:33.658]  And the police were beating the people up, throwing them in the squad cars and taking them away.
[00:50:34.519 --> 00:50:41.225]  Well, I mean, they caught a family trying to get some firewood to cook their food off the side of the road and they machine gunned the car laughing and ran over it with a tank.
[00:50:41.285 --> 00:50:43.747]  I mean, we've heard that many times.
[00:50:43.787 --> 00:50:44.627]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[00:50:45.908 --> 00:50:46.569]  We'll be back.
[00:50:46.709 --> 00:50:50.973]  I mean, look, people in black masks, torturing, that's good, okay?
[00:50:52.214 --> 00:50:52.534]  It's good.
[00:50:53.972 --> 00:50:54.332]  It's good.
[00:50:55.492 --> 00:50:56.073]  Gotta learn this.
[00:50:57.153 --> 00:50:58.533]  Herb gassing American children.
[00:50:58.593 --> 00:50:59.313]  They say it's good.
[00:50:59.694 --> 00:51:00.874]  I don't think it is, but okay.
[00:51:01.374 --> 00:51:05.735]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.895 --> 00:51:10.336]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.476 --> 00:51:14.858]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.898 --> 00:51:16.238]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.018 --> 00:51:18.119]  Pan America.
[00:51:46.738 --> 00:51:51.481]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:08.553 --> 00:52:21.566]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[00:52:21.826 --> 00:52:25.130]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:35.953]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.233 --> 00:52:36.733]  That's right!
[00:52:36.913 --> 00:52:43.995]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.315 --> 00:52:48.441]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[00:54:08.336 --> 00:54:11.158]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.561 --> 00:54:20.704]  Coming up in about 15 minutes in the next hour, we've got Ellen Mariani coming on.
[00:54:23.065 --> 00:54:26.768]  One of the 9-11 widows has been suing the government for involvement.
[00:54:26.788 --> 00:54:34.333]  A lot of new big developments there, but I pushed back her interview a little bit because I want to be able to go to Joe and Cliff and Adam and
[00:54:34.941 --> 00:54:36.602]  Everybody else has been patiently holding.
[00:54:37.723 --> 00:54:41.145]  But before I do that, my films.
[00:54:41.365 --> 00:54:46.888]  They're the best films out there, bar none, many people have said, exposing the New World Order.
[00:54:46.928 --> 00:54:52.451]  Because my films cover a wide array of issues per film.
[00:54:54.132 --> 00:55:00.656]  And always cover things in a historical perspective, but then give you the motive of why the globalists are doing what they're doing.
[00:55:01.232 --> 00:55:05.795]  Whether it's the police state or government-sponsored terror to get us to accept the police state.
[00:55:07.476 --> 00:55:08.436]  These are great videos.
[00:55:09.777 --> 00:55:18.162]  Like 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror Exposed, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, The Matrix of Evil, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:55:18.743 --> 00:55:25.126]  But I also carry other great films like Eric Huffschmid's acclaimed 9-11 Painful Deceptions, his video and book.
[00:55:25.907 --> 00:55:27.108]  The book is Painful Questions.
[00:55:28.368 --> 00:55:29.489]  Also George Humphrey's 9-11,
[00:55:31.542 --> 00:55:41.384]  The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, an incredible film that also gives you a wide swath of documentation and really covers September 11th.
[00:55:41.944 --> 00:55:43.584]  We've got that on VHS and DVD.
[00:55:43.624 --> 00:55:47.645]  We've got a bunch of different specials going right now.
[00:55:47.685 --> 00:55:56.207]  By the way, when you order, say, George Humphrey's video by itself, you get three, what, 80-plus page color booklets that accompany it with all the documents.
[00:55:56.866 --> 00:55:58.347]  He's got a bunch of different specials.
[00:55:58.387 --> 00:56:01.810]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:56:02.250 --> 00:56:06.973]  Peruse the secure online shopping cart for those specials.
[00:56:08.995 --> 00:56:09.795]  Order online.
[00:56:09.855 --> 00:56:10.936]  Watch clips of the films.
[00:56:11.496 --> 00:56:13.017]  Or call toll free to get the videos.
[00:56:13.037 --> 00:56:13.097]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:13.117 --> 00:56:13.338]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:56:24.927 --> 00:56:43.415]  And this week on PrisonPlanet.tv for members, 15 cents a day, we have put the interview with Dean Haglund of the X-Files, talking about that lone government episode, thinking the government may have planted that story on him, of the hijacked jet being flown by remote control in the World Trade Center for martial law months before 9-11.
[00:56:44.575 --> 00:56:48.237]  We have again Muhammad Atta and the Venice Flying Circus by
[00:56:49.815 --> 00:56:52.176]  Daniel Hopsicker authorizes us to do that.
[00:56:52.957 --> 00:56:56.599]  Going up, we've got my 9-11 Painful Deceptions.
[00:56:58.459 --> 00:57:00.340]  Well, that video's already up there.
[00:57:00.861 --> 00:57:02.101]  But we also have
[00:57:03.951 --> 00:57:07.814]  My video, 9-1-1 Emergency Release, but only offered for a few months.
[00:57:08.214 --> 00:57:13.818]  It was an emergency release on 9-11 that I put out, but some people think that's an even better video than Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:14.159 --> 00:57:16.941]  I put that out within about a month or two of 9-11.
[00:57:17.381 --> 00:57:18.562]  Only offered it for a few months.
[00:57:18.682 --> 00:57:26.468]  You'll be able to watch that, as they say, out of print video on PrisonPlanet.tv, if you're a member as well.
[00:57:26.888 --> 00:57:29.310]  Alright, let's go ahead and take a call.
[00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:32.012]  Let's talk now to
[00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.161]  Joe in Boston.
[00:57:34.201 --> 00:57:34.902]  Joe, go ahead.
[00:57:34.922 --> 00:57:35.503]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:35.543 --> 00:57:36.163]  How are you doing today?
[00:57:36.203 --> 00:57:36.424]  Good.
[00:57:36.984 --> 00:57:38.126]  Hey, I wanted to ask you.
[00:57:38.146 --> 00:57:38.966]  I'm a blind person.
[00:57:38.986 --> 00:57:40.008]  I've got all your videos.
[00:57:40.048 --> 00:57:41.349]  I can't see them, but I can hear them.
[00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:47.736]  Your e-books, all those books in electronic form, because my scanner is not that good of a scanner.
[00:57:47.756 --> 00:57:53.503]  You know, I have the reading software and... Yeah, they're all in a text format that I believe your reader will read.
[00:57:54.116 --> 00:57:55.977]  Well, my scanner sometimes has trouble.
[00:57:55.997 --> 00:58:02.102]  I know there may be pictures in the books, but I mean, if I... Are they up there on your website to download with no charge or what?
[00:58:02.162 --> 00:58:02.462]  I don't know.
[00:58:02.502 --> 00:58:03.723]  I know you say you have e-books.
[00:58:03.923 --> 00:58:04.463]  No, no, no.
[00:58:04.483 --> 00:58:13.810]  My e-books are for... When you pay the 15 cents a day, you could go download my book and Paul Watson's book or read it right there on the site.
[00:58:14.350 --> 00:58:16.612]  And what other e-books are up there on the prison planet?
[00:58:16.652 --> 00:58:17.212]  Can you tell me?
[00:58:17.352 --> 00:58:19.734]  Are there... There's... I don't have it in front of me.
[00:58:19.754 --> 00:58:21.515]  There's, I don't know, probably 10 other books there.
[00:58:21.796 --> 00:58:23.597]  But they're all in electronic format, right?
[00:58:24.446 --> 00:58:26.868]  Well, yeah, that's how computers work.
[00:58:27.728 --> 00:58:30.610]  What about these videos that you can't buy?
[00:58:30.670 --> 00:58:35.253]  These things you were talking about, like that guy that you interviewed.
[00:58:35.553 --> 00:58:37.934]  Will that be able to be sold pretty soon?
[00:58:38.014 --> 00:58:40.836]  No, it's just available through prisonplanet.tv.
[00:58:41.357 --> 00:58:43.098]  Oh, because I wish you would have it to be sold.
[00:58:44.438 --> 00:58:44.959]  I hear you.
[00:58:44.999 --> 00:58:45.759]  Anything else, sir?
[00:58:46.099 --> 00:58:47.540]  No, nothing else, but thanks a bunch.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:48.381]  Good to hear from you.
[00:58:57.681 --> 00:58:58.321]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.982 --> 00:59:00.062]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.763 --> 00:59:01.843]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.504 --> 00:59:03.364]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.085 --> 00:59:06.006]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.026 --> 00:59:09.308]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.828 --> 00:59:13.911]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:29.429 --> 00:59:33.430]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, TGIF.
[00:59:34.751 --> 00:59:44.614]  TGIF, I get to just plunge into spending time with my family, and I get to plunge into cleaning out my garage.
[00:59:44.754 --> 00:59:53.237]  I get to plunge into spending about eight hours a day, on top of that, working on martial law.
[00:59:53.257 --> 00:59:55.878]  9-1-1, rise of the police state.
[00:59:57.518 --> 01:00:01.360]  Because normally, of course, I do my own radio show and then two or three interviews a day.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:05.581]  Then on top of that, I then go to work until late at night on this film.
[01:00:06.442 --> 01:00:07.102]  It's kind of nice.
[01:00:07.122 --> 01:00:13.565]  I get to spend more time with the family and then just throw myself at the film because then it's somewhat enjoyable.
[01:00:13.785 --> 01:00:19.087]  It's pretty hard when you're... I'm not whining here, but I just wish there was more I could do.
[01:00:20.207 --> 01:00:23.829]  But unfortunately, if you want something done right, you've got to do it yourself.
[01:00:24.889 --> 01:00:26.310]  And Marshall Law,
[01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:32.662]  9-1-1-1 Rise of the Police State will be available in late February.
[01:00:33.482 --> 01:00:36.963]  It will be done in early February on PrisonPlanet.tv for members.
[01:00:38.443 --> 01:00:42.625]  But, then I have to have the DVDs mass manufactured, and that takes two or three weeks.
[01:00:43.845 --> 01:00:46.966]  To send it off, have it authored, then have a couple thousand of them printed up.
[01:00:47.767 --> 01:00:49.907]  I know we've got mega-callers here.
[01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:51.208]  We've got Ellen Mariani, 9-11-Widow,
[01:00:52.685 --> 01:00:54.226]  Good morning and bless you for what you're doing, Alex.
[01:00:54.246 --> 01:00:55.567]  I talked to Joyce Riley and Stan Dale this morning.
[01:00:55.587 --> 01:01:00.129]  There's a very bad alert out for different types of stuff that's going to be happening to
[01:01:18.539 --> 01:01:24.426]  Los Angeles and San Joaquin Valley and the Bajas and New Zealand and places like that.
[01:01:25.126 --> 01:01:27.709]  You can find out the information on standeo.com.
[01:01:27.749 --> 01:01:28.911]  Well, what type of alerts?
[01:01:28.931 --> 01:01:29.411]  What do you mean?
[01:01:29.511 --> 01:01:30.793]  Alerts for earthquakes.
[01:01:31.714 --> 01:01:38.842]  Well, yeah, the Earth is definitely in an upset cycle right now with snow in Las Vegas and
[01:01:41.038 --> 01:01:47.841]  Let me speak real quick here, then I'll get off the line so somebody else can get on there.
[01:01:48.161 --> 01:01:50.902]  I've been monitoring HAARP for about two and a half months.
[01:01:51.502 --> 01:01:54.143]  And Mr. Dale and me talked about that, and also Joyce Riley.
[01:01:54.644 --> 01:01:58.946]  I have all the patents and all the information, you know, I've been studying on that.
[01:01:59.366 --> 01:02:04.268]  And I've made an antenna, a TeslaCoil antenna with intermittent snap-ins for different frequencies.
[01:02:05.297 --> 01:02:11.742]  And they've been really shooting that stuff, you know, electromagnetic radiation into the atmosphere real steady here lately.
[01:02:12.183 --> 01:02:16.386]  And it comes on for 22 seconds and then goes off for 72, then it comes right back on.
[01:02:16.827 --> 01:02:20.530]  But they shut it off this morning at 6.40 California time.
[01:02:21.691 --> 01:02:26.595]  And there's a new patent out by the name of Franklin Y. K. Chen.
[01:02:26.655 --> 01:02:27.435]  C-H-E-N.
[01:02:27.956 --> 01:02:31.859]  I've got all the numbers and I'd like to give you this information to the guy before I hang up.
[01:02:33.208 --> 01:02:34.809]  Well, you know, patents are incredible.
[01:02:35.129 --> 01:02:39.430]  They've got, you know, 1954, the sound of the skull system.
[01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:40.291]  People don't believe that.
[01:02:40.331 --> 01:02:42.812]  Now the military is going to have it in their helmets.
[01:02:43.632 --> 01:02:46.713]  I mean, it's just so much incredible stuff that has been invented.
[01:02:46.733 --> 01:02:47.273]  And you're right.
[01:02:47.693 --> 01:02:49.834]  They do have weather modification technology.
[01:02:49.914 --> 01:02:52.175]  It's been quite well developed.
[01:02:52.195 --> 01:02:53.255]  It's pretty advanced now.
[01:02:53.755 --> 01:02:54.936]  What's this new patent number?
[01:02:55.296 --> 01:02:56.296]  The patent number is 5762298
[01:03:01.670 --> 01:03:03.051]  June 9th, 1998.
[01:03:03.471 --> 01:03:05.892]  It's by Franklin Chin.
[01:03:06.432 --> 01:03:12.236]  And he was involved with them 90 scientists down there at the Oak Ridge Laboratories, you know, in Tennessee.
[01:03:13.476 --> 01:03:22.501]  And him and the guy that invented, you know, the deal for the HAARP system, you know, I've got all the stuff on him too.
[01:03:23.081 --> 01:03:25.622]  But they've got a lot of other people working all this stuff now.
[01:03:26.123 --> 01:03:27.323]  And they're really gearing it up.
[01:03:27.604 --> 01:03:28.084]  And that's what
[01:03:28.917 --> 01:03:32.439]  It really surprised me, the guy that invented the HAARP system, his name was Eastland.
[01:03:33.079 --> 01:03:34.840]  Have you ever read his patent?
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:35.901]  Ah, yes I have.
[01:03:36.501 --> 01:03:42.284]  Okay, well he's involved with a bunch of them now, and they're working like heck with this, and they've got a bunch of this stuff already up in the satellites.
[01:03:43.404 --> 01:03:45.525]  Alrighty, sir, well thank you for the call.
[01:03:46.146 --> 01:03:48.247]  We'll be right back, presentplanet.tv.
[01:03:54.247 --> 01:03:55.728]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:03:55.929 --> 01:04:03.275]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:04:03.595 --> 01:04:07.998]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:18.107]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:04:18.848 --> 01:04:22.532]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:04:22.852 --> 01:04:25.335]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:04:25.355 --> 01:04:31.582]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:04:31.822 --> 01:04:33.384]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:04:33.644 --> 01:04:34.526]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:04:34.606 --> 01:04:37.590]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:38.671]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:04:38.711 --> 01:04:38.912]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:04:38.952 --> 01:04:43.258]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:04:43.418 --> 01:04:44.359]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:04:53.365 --> 01:04:54.967]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.348 --> 01:05:01.075]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:01.336 --> 01:05:06.483]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:06.823 --> 01:05:08.125]  The self-sterilizing black
[01:05:08.365 --> 01:05:09.105]  We're good to go!
[01:05:31.051 --> 01:05:37.037]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:05:37.317 --> 01:05:43.524]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:05:44.565 --> 01:05:45.526]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.214 --> 01:05:54.754]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:05:54.934 --> 01:05:58.015]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:02.036]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:06:02.096 --> 01:06:06.317]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:06:06.677 --> 01:06:10.438]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:06:10.578 --> 01:06:12.379]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:06:12.659 --> 01:06:15.881]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:06:15.921 --> 01:06:20.623]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:06:20.803 --> 01:06:23.844]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:06:24.024 --> 01:06:26.886]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:06:27.386 --> 01:06:33.489]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:37.832]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:06:38.233 --> 01:06:39.594]  Order your video today.

[01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:46.459]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.313 --> 01:07:10.173]  Hello, my friends.
[01:07:10.393 --> 01:07:15.115]  Again, eight minutes, 18 seconds into this second hour.
[01:07:15.135 --> 01:07:16.635]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:07:18.176 --> 01:07:30.480]  Well, Governor Ridge is on the Army Public Affairs section of the Army.mil website saying, oh yeah, we're integrating the regular Army with the police, and this is the model we want to use all over the country.
[01:07:31.568 --> 01:07:37.131]  I wish they'd put the army on the borders, the Canadian and the Mexican border, but that would be constitutional.
[01:07:37.531 --> 01:07:44.094]  So let's do everything that's unconstitutional and does nothing to keep us safe, but everything that brings us into a high-tech police state.
[01:07:45.635 --> 01:07:49.097]  And Governor Ridge is also out front
[01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:58.475]  Uh, saying that he is very, very proud to announce deals with Europe and other countries to have a unified ID card.
[01:07:58.515 --> 01:08:06.620]  Not just a state driver's license ID card, that's under federal biometric national ID card standards, but now with foreign countries.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:12.764]  So, I remember about four years ago reading the United Nations talk about world standardization of
[01:08:13.777 --> 01:08:21.227]  driver's license and now that is beginning to happen or citizen ID cards
[01:08:23.590 --> 01:08:24.330]  Very scary.
[01:08:24.811 --> 01:08:27.152]  Here's an article out of the Aberdeen News.
[01:08:27.792 --> 01:08:29.893]  Local board members needed.
[01:08:29.913 --> 01:08:38.437]  The Selective Service System is looking for men and women to serve as members of local boards that are currently in a standby mode.
[01:08:39.077 --> 01:08:42.839]  A prospective member must be a United States citizen, at least 18 years old,
[01:08:44.697 --> 01:08:55.403]  Registered with the Selective Service, if male, not employed in law enforcement, not active or retired Armed Forces member, and not convicted in any criminal offense.
[01:08:56.284 --> 01:09:05.209]  Once identified as qualified, candidates recommended by the Governor are appointed by the Director of the Selective Service, acting on behalf of the President of the United States.
[01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:11.312]  As board vacancies occur, they must be filled with candidates from the identified jurisdictions.
[01:09:11.412 --> 01:09:19.396]  Each new board member receives initial training after appointment and consideration training each year thereafter.
[01:09:21.616 --> 01:09:37.604]  If a military draft becomes necessary, approximately 2,000 local and appeals boards throughout the nation will decide which young men in each community receive deferments, postponements, or exemptions for military service based on federal guidelines and community standards.
[01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:42.627]  Anyone interested in becoming should contact Sonny
[01:09:43.676 --> 01:09:48.338]  Now they haven't been setting up the draft boards since the end of Vietnam.
[01:09:48.378 --> 01:09:51.859]  They've introduced the bills for a draft.
[01:10:10.618 --> 01:10:14.359]  The Pentagon's own documents are now public that the war is being lost.
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:16.120]  It's getting worse and worse.
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:25.444]  They said National Guardsmen are going to have to maybe spend not just two years now, 24 months, but four years or longer!
[01:10:28.205 --> 01:10:30.246]  And how are they going to get a draft?
[01:10:30.366 --> 01:10:36.068]  Well, I'm sure if there's an unfortunate terror attack, that'll all get us to submit and go along with the draft.
[01:10:37.026 --> 01:10:39.168]  I've got the Pentagon news release here.
[01:10:39.208 --> 01:10:46.913]  They are considering attacking, that's right my friends, attacking Syria.
[01:10:48.294 --> 01:10:51.516]  Saying that they've got the weapons of mass destruction.
[01:10:52.857 --> 01:11:00.241]  Bush, of course, over the weekend said, Iraq invasion worth it despite lack of weapons of mass destruction.
[01:11:00.762 --> 01:11:03.844]  The invasion of Iraq which ousted Saddam Hussein.
[01:11:04.796 --> 01:11:07.337]  And has cost the lives of some 1,300 U.S.
[01:11:07.837 --> 01:11:18.480]  military personnel and billions of dollars, what is it, 300 billion now, was absolutely worth it, despite the absence of any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:28.563]  President Bush told ABC News, Barbara Walters, in an exclusive interview, that they've already released clips of days ago, but it's coming out this weekend, or tonight.
[01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:34.652]  The White House acknowledged today that there is no longer an active search for Iraq weapons of mass destruction.
[01:11:35.012 --> 01:11:36.832]  The final report from Chief U.S.
[01:11:36.872 --> 01:11:51.336]  Weapons Inspector Charles Dufeller, due out next month, has concluded that the former regime had no formal written strategy or plan for the revival of a weapons of mass destruction program.
[01:11:52.677 --> 01:11:53.497]  Isn't that just
[01:11:54.224 --> 01:11:55.145]  Just darling.
[01:11:55.785 --> 01:11:59.868]  Later, I want to get into European probe lands on Saturn's moon.
[01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:02.851]  And more on what I talked about earlier.
[01:12:02.871 --> 01:12:02.911]  U.S.
[01:12:02.931 --> 01:12:09.776]  Homeland Security Chief calls for international biometric standards on ID cards.
[01:12:10.496 --> 01:12:11.697]  Adam in Kentucky.
[01:12:12.338 --> 01:12:12.758]  Welcome.
[01:12:13.098 --> 01:12:13.879]  Hello, Alex.
[01:12:14.179 --> 01:12:14.740]  Hello, sir.
[01:12:14.860 --> 01:12:15.500]  Love your show.
[01:12:16.041 --> 01:12:17.982]  Yeah, I kind of got a question for you.
[01:12:18.542 --> 01:12:21.805]  Around here, we had a couple of schools that got the
[01:12:22.799 --> 01:12:26.440]  Some kind of unknown rash, kind of burning on the skin and stuff.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.301]  It was in a couple of schools I got sent off.
[01:12:28.641 --> 01:12:31.462]  Supposedly to Atlanta, Georgia right now to be analyzed.
[01:12:31.502 --> 01:12:38.764]  But I got a phone call last night from a friend of mine that she watches satellite, I guess something on satellite news or something like this.
[01:12:39.504 --> 01:12:47.166]  And she was telling me about some kind of airborne infection that had spread over like seven or eight different states.
[01:12:47.906 --> 01:12:50.247]  And I hadn't heard nothing about it and I was just kind of wondering
[01:12:50.856 --> 01:12:52.576]  Seems like nobody knows what it is or anything.
[01:12:52.596 --> 01:13:02.819]  I just kind of wonder if this is something they dropped out there to see how fast it would spread, or how it would affect, or have you heard anything about it or anything?
[01:13:03.399 --> 01:13:07.600]  Well, last hour I talked about the thousands of admitted cases where the U.S.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:08.940]  government killed U.S.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:16.682]  citizens in subways in San Francisco, open air release in a subway in New York, to U.S.
[01:13:16.722 --> 01:13:17.102]  troops.
[01:13:17.762 --> 01:13:18.762]  So this is admitted.
[01:13:19.326 --> 01:13:20.707]  You know, just type it into Google.
[01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:21.387]  U.S.
[01:13:21.407 --> 01:13:23.648]  government tests lethal biologicals on U.S.
[01:13:23.688 --> 01:13:26.109]  citizens or chemical weapons on citizens.
[01:13:26.430 --> 01:13:30.352]  Hundreds and hundreds of articles, if not thousands, will pop up over the years.
[01:13:30.952 --> 01:13:33.293]  But somehow the average public isn't even aware of this.
[01:13:34.654 --> 01:13:44.899]  A big problem that isn't government-related, at least directly, is that after 50 years of over-use, the over-prescription
[01:13:46.215 --> 01:14:09.308]  of antibiotics you have thousands of superbugs and there are horrible flesh-eating bacteria all over the world now killing people killing hundreds a year in this country and if you count all the staph infections it's thousands you have just horrible drug-resistant or drug-immune TB all over the US now that's
[01:14:10.131 --> 01:14:15.152]  Again, you hardly ever hear about because people would call for the borders being controlled, so there's no discussion of that.
[01:14:15.192 --> 01:14:18.413]  I mean, when immigrants came to Ellis Island, they tested them for TB.
[01:14:18.733 --> 01:14:19.853]  They don't even do that now.
[01:14:19.933 --> 01:14:21.014]  It's just, come on in!
[01:14:21.314 --> 01:14:23.714]  We'll put you next to our children in the public schools!
[01:14:25.035 --> 01:14:39.578]  And there is a horrible respiratory problem giving people deathly pneumonia in both sides of the lungs, upper and lower in each lung and on both lungs, all over the country, killing a lot of people.
[01:14:40.990 --> 01:14:49.055]  Well, I just thought it was kind of strange, and I just wanted to get feedback on it, and I figured you'd be the first person to call there and find out about it.
[01:14:49.135 --> 01:14:54.278]  And I sure love your show there, and I'll get out of your way so other callers can ask other questions.
[01:14:54.439 --> 01:14:54.959]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:14:55.259 --> 01:14:55.939]  Thank you, sir.
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.621]  It was really good hearing from you.
[01:14:57.701 --> 01:15:04.345]  Roger and others, your calls are coming up later, and we'll tell you about this World ID Card System as well.
[01:15:05.405 --> 01:15:07.387]  But right now, I am honored
[01:15:08.169 --> 01:15:11.813]  to have with us a 9-11 widow, Ellen Mariani.
[01:15:12.914 --> 01:15:28.689]  And we interviewed her about a year ago, and now she's back on with us to tell us about her lawsuit against Bush, bringing forward evidence of government complicity, and just some of the things that have happened since we interviewed her.
[01:15:28.749 --> 01:15:33.033]  There's now been a criminal complaint to the New York Attorney General, Elliot Spitzer,
[01:15:33.780 --> 01:15:33.860]  I am.
[01:15:33.880 --> 01:15:34.220]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:36.081]  And everything I'm going to say today, I have proof of.
[01:15:57.031 --> 01:15:59.994]  Well, there's been a lot of things that have happened.
[01:16:00.194 --> 01:16:04.698]  First off, tell us about yourself and about your husband and how you got involved and how you woke up.
[01:16:05.378 --> 01:16:07.240]  Woke up after 40 years of sleeping.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:12.324]  I never dreamed we had a system, a judicial system that is corrupt.
[01:16:12.945 --> 01:16:14.586]  Completely corrupt.
[01:16:15.707 --> 01:16:19.891]  And I also believe that 9-11 was intentionally allowed to happen.
[01:16:21.232 --> 01:16:24.715]  And I'm very sad over that and I think we've all got to wake up
[01:16:25.396 --> 01:16:34.442]  Hopefully it's not 40 years like I did until some person or persons or a government started this in September 11, 2001.
[01:16:35.522 --> 01:16:39.405]  I was on a wedding trip to my daughter's and my husband was behind me.
[01:16:40.425 --> 01:16:41.566]  We kissed him three times.
[01:16:41.606 --> 01:16:48.350]  We kissed each other and hugged each other and that was the last time I've ever seen or heard of him, where he is.
[01:16:49.301 --> 01:16:51.523]  Heard his voice or seen his smiling face.
[01:16:51.583 --> 01:16:53.724]  There is nothing found of him.
[01:16:54.164 --> 01:17:00.148]  And the aircraft that he was supposedly on, tell folks what that hit.
[01:17:00.909 --> 01:17:09.054]  That was supposedly, you know, to be the flight he was on, 175, that was supposedly the one that hit the second tower.
[01:17:09.695 --> 01:17:18.641]  Now there's a lot of people that do not believe it, and because they went ahead, the government blocked my wrongful death lawsuit December 20th.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:29.185]  2001 literally went right in there, the government officials, with the excuse of security and blocked and threw out my wrongful death.
[01:17:29.265 --> 01:17:36.309]  I believe it's the only one that's ever been thrown out in our country due to security reasons.
[01:17:36.349 --> 01:17:38.850]  Well, they always declare national security.
[01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:46.194]  Well, my question is, Mr. President and all his officials that he has
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:47.881]  brought on with him.
[01:17:47.901 --> 01:17:54.825]  Yeah, the big cover artist, Michael Chertoff, is going to be the new Homeland Security leader.
[01:17:55.225 --> 01:17:59.047]  Who are they protecting and being whose security?
[01:17:59.407 --> 01:18:00.388]  That's my question.
[01:18:01.508 --> 01:18:04.530]  Well, the security of the New World Order, Ellen.
[01:18:05.731 --> 01:18:06.591]  There I go again.
[01:18:06.651 --> 01:18:11.134]  I've been sleeping for 40 years until they murdered
[01:18:11.810 --> 01:18:23.058]  Many, including my husband, innocent people, who now have thousands and thousands of homeless children, fatherless, motherless, who go to bed at night crying and do not know the truth.
[01:18:24.219 --> 01:18:33.486]  And the government told you guys, this isn't even in the mainstream news, we'll pay you off and give you money if you drop all your claims or if you shut up about government involvement.
[01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:39.773]  And thousands of families haven't gone along, but it's hard for them to ever get on the news.
[01:18:40.033 --> 01:18:48.517]  Well, the part that I don't like is not only did they say that, but they gathered grieving groups through the Red Cross.
[01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.038]  The Red Cross is in on this, too.
[01:18:50.078 --> 01:18:50.798]  Oh, of course they are.
[01:18:50.818 --> 01:18:51.179]  Stay there.
[01:18:51.199 --> 01:18:51.939]  We'll talk about them.
[01:18:55.862 --> 01:19:01.344]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:19:01.764 --> 01:19:05.985]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:19:06.225 --> 01:19:13.267]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:19:13.647 --> 01:19:19.749]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:19:19.889 --> 01:19:21.109]  There are no side effects.
[01:19:21.449 --> 01:19:24.390]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:19:24.550 --> 01:19:26.571]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:19:26.871 --> 01:19:34.114]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:19:34.414 --> 01:19:37.795]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:19:41.639 --> 01:19:42.660]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:42.880]  Call today.
[01:19:53.243 --> 01:19:59.446]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[01:19:59.907 --> 01:20:07.691]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[01:20:08.031 --> 01:20:15.875]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[01:20:16.195 --> 01:20:20.956]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:20:21.276 --> 01:20:25.977]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[01:20:26.497 --> 01:20:30.358]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[01:20:30.858 --> 01:20:31.858]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[01:21:52.597 --> 01:21:55.979]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:21:56.220 --> 01:21:56.560]  Why?
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:59.522]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[01:22:56.607 --> 01:23:04.369]  Alright, we're talking to Ellen Mariani, and since you brought up the Red Cross, I just want to say this.
[01:23:05.289 --> 01:23:06.449]  I go in 7-Eleven.
[01:23:08.870 --> 01:23:09.670]  I'm in businesses.
[01:23:10.010 --> 01:23:10.730]  It's everywhere.
[01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:12.671]  Give her the Red Cross for the tsunami.
[01:23:14.071 --> 01:23:15.171]  I said this after 9-Eleven.
[01:23:15.191 --> 01:23:17.152]  The Red Cross stole half the money.
[01:23:18.965 --> 01:23:28.913]  The Red Cross actually went to the Oklahoma City Post Office and said give us all the mail and they took it from Oklahoma City and falsified signatures and stole all of it.
[01:23:29.193 --> 01:23:30.334]  They lost a 1.3 million dollar lawsuit.
[01:23:32.145 --> 01:23:33.425]  Just with one family over there.
[01:23:33.465 --> 01:23:34.926]  People see a family on TV.
[01:23:35.526 --> 01:23:37.246]  Oh, I'm going to send that lady $10,000.
[01:23:37.466 --> 01:23:38.086]  Never got there.
[01:23:38.186 --> 01:23:41.227]  It's an actual criminal organization.
[01:23:41.267 --> 01:23:43.127]  It's been an intelligence arm for a long time.
[01:23:43.707 --> 01:23:49.869]  The Bank of England sending $25 million to Lennon used Red Cross agents to do it.
[01:23:49.889 --> 01:23:51.529]  I mean, it's a well-known CIA front.
[01:23:52.269 --> 01:23:58.891]  For folks who don't know that, just type Red Cross members intelligence front.
[01:23:59.091 --> 01:23:59.891]  Hundreds of articles.
[01:24:01.153 --> 01:24:04.034]  And so, this is how the system works, folks.
[01:24:04.094 --> 01:24:05.155]  They suck off of you.
[01:24:05.535 --> 01:24:07.035]  Give to small charities.
[01:24:08.476 --> 01:24:13.658]  But tell us, Ellen, how the Red Cross helped run the scams of suppressing the families.
[01:24:14.038 --> 01:24:19.280]  Well, first of all, I'm looking at a three-ring notebook of eight chapters.
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:23.822]  And first, they gathered all these grieving families.
[01:24:23.882 --> 01:24:25.222]  And I mean, we are grieving.
[01:24:25.342 --> 01:24:26.103]  We are hurting.
[01:24:26.663 --> 01:24:28.524]  It feels like you're having a heart attack.
[01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:29.604]  The hurt is so bad.
[01:24:30.663 --> 01:24:34.306]  They gathered them all together in different areas of sections of the country.
[01:24:35.127 --> 01:24:37.368]  They coddled them.
[01:24:37.609 --> 01:24:41.672]  They, you know, decided they were going to bring in all these professional people.
[01:24:42.252 --> 01:24:42.633]  People!
[01:24:43.153 --> 01:24:44.514]  And I'm going to read you a few.
[01:24:44.594 --> 01:24:48.658]  They started a Massachusetts 9-11 fund through stores.
[01:24:48.758 --> 01:24:51.800]  They sent in thousands and thousands of dollars.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.763]  Then there became a financial strategy person who represented them.
[01:24:55.783 --> 01:24:57.244]  Then it went to Wells Fargo.
[01:24:57.285 --> 01:24:58.886]  They're talking about home mortgages.
[01:24:59.446 --> 01:25:00.007]  Banking.
[01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:04.765]  And then solutions for financial planning, health and education.
[01:25:04.805 --> 01:25:08.887]  They even had vacations set up for the children.
[01:25:09.927 --> 01:25:11.968]  Anything to bring these people to trust them.
[01:25:12.528 --> 01:25:15.029]  But while they were doing that, we were grieving so badly.
[01:25:15.229 --> 01:25:16.870]  I didn't buy that.
[01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:21.192]  They decided to coerce them into medication.
[01:25:21.252 --> 01:25:22.553]  Yes, we were grieving.
[01:25:23.073 --> 01:25:24.293]  Now they're all on medication.
[01:25:24.373 --> 01:25:27.655]  And then they take this huge meeting, bring it to Boston.
[01:25:28.556 --> 01:25:40.901]  And they all meet, these professional people all meet, either through President Bush and Jeb Bush's private attorneys, who helped out with the 2000 election, to whom he borrowed a lot of money from.
[01:25:41.401 --> 01:25:45.543]  This law firm is called Greenberg & Treyrig, from Boston.
[01:25:46.604 --> 01:25:54.547]  This is where my grieving stepdaughter, my husband's only heir, met in that office, through those people.
[01:25:55.663 --> 01:26:08.197]  A year or so after I had been approved court-wise to be the administrator of my dead husband's estate, they persuaded her, we don't know how, to go after me to fight for the estate.
[01:26:08.878 --> 01:26:12.081]  They will do anything to anybody to get their way.
[01:26:12.842 --> 01:26:13.403]  And they did it.
[01:26:14.884 --> 01:26:22.153]  Well, it's been in the news that the government comes to the families and says, look, just shut up about 9-11 and questions and you'll get millions of dollars.
[01:26:22.193 --> 01:26:23.915]  No, you will not get millions of dollars.
[01:26:23.955 --> 01:26:25.777]  They take the age of the deceased person.
[01:26:25.817 --> 01:26:26.938]  They take what he's made.
[01:26:27.279 --> 01:26:28.780]  How many years left till he's 65?
[01:26:29.181 --> 01:26:30.062]  How many dependents?
[01:26:30.535 --> 01:26:36.758]  And that's how they size up... You understand, the Red Cross and the United Way, how many billions?
[01:26:36.879 --> 01:26:39.340]  It ended up being, what, five billion bucks they got?
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.502]  I don't know, but they stole from the widows and the families over a billion dollars.
[01:26:43.802 --> 01:26:45.563]  Gave it to the cleanup crew to eat.
[01:26:45.803 --> 01:26:47.304]  Okay, where is FEMA?
[01:26:49.045 --> 01:26:50.346]  Well, they always say it's for that.
[01:26:50.386 --> 01:26:55.229]  Did you know in World War II in Korea and Vietnam they would charge for donuts?
[01:26:56.489 --> 01:26:59.251]  And I can't tell you how many veterans I've had call in
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:14.275]  Occasionally they would go buy a carton of cigarettes from the Red Cross because they would sell stuff and they'd open it and there'd be a letter to another GI and some money and in some occasions you'd get your own mail hidden inside the cigarette pack.
[01:27:14.676 --> 01:27:16.818]  Their specialty is mail stealing.
[01:27:17.138 --> 01:27:17.479]  Right.
[01:27:18.266 --> 01:27:19.187]  I'm not kidding, Ellen.
[01:27:19.807 --> 01:27:20.548]  Oh, I believe it.
[01:27:20.628 --> 01:27:24.771]  I mean, they're stealing children right from their mothers and fathers here in our country.
[01:27:25.191 --> 01:27:31.376]  They have people that know that, you know, like the agencies, the social agencies and schools and them.
[01:27:31.776 --> 01:27:36.760]  If they don't like the parent or something about them or they have a gripe to grind,
[01:27:37.324 --> 01:27:38.385]  They will report them.
[01:27:38.425 --> 01:27:40.166]  You never know who your accuser is.
[01:27:40.206 --> 01:27:44.090]  And then you get a knock at the door and your children are taken away.
[01:27:44.230 --> 01:27:45.311]  That is what's happening.
[01:27:45.331 --> 01:27:47.653]  So this is what families you're talking to have told you?
[01:27:47.933 --> 01:27:48.453]  Yes it is.
[01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:55.019]  I'm sitting looking at one of the dads right now that hasn't seen his three beautiful children for five years.
[01:27:56.827 --> 01:27:58.968]  They had no justice in the court system.
[01:27:59.008 --> 01:28:00.589]  They couldn't face their accusers.
[01:28:01.109 --> 01:28:03.611]  So now, because of this, you're finding out about the whole New World Order system?
[01:28:03.631 --> 01:28:14.837]  I'm finding out about this whole rotten, corrupt judicial system that we should be really bringing down through our legislatures, our senators, state reps.
[01:28:15.640 --> 01:28:16.901]  And the whole corruption here.
[01:28:16.921 --> 01:28:17.641]  Well, I want to get into 9-11.
[01:28:17.741 --> 01:28:19.182]  I want to get into the suits.
[01:28:19.242 --> 01:28:21.204]  I want to give folks the latest developments when we get back.
[01:28:21.304 --> 01:28:22.024]  Ellen Mariani.
[01:28:22.044 --> 01:28:24.546]  Again, you've probably seen her on national TV a few times.
[01:28:25.547 --> 01:28:27.608]  Just a bulldog when it comes to the truth.
[01:28:28.769 --> 01:28:36.974]  And the globals have a problem because there's strong women like her out there who's going to fight to get the truth out about what happened to her husband.
[01:28:37.294 --> 01:28:37.935]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:37.955 --> 01:28:38.355]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:46.790]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.713 --> 01:28:50.401]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.436 --> 01:28:55.417]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:28:55.497 --> 01:29:06.223]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:29:06.603 --> 01:29:11.126]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.

[01:29:23.112 --> 01:29:29.962]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[01:30:54.241 --> 01:30:55.702]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:30:55.822 --> 01:30:58.223]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:30:58.584 --> 01:30:59.444]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:30:59.824 --> 01:31:01.045]  Oil War III has started.
[01:31:01.345 --> 01:31:03.787]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:31:04.207 --> 01:31:07.609]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:31:08.029 --> 01:31:08.870]  Why else would the U.S.
[01:31:08.890 --> 01:31:11.851]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:31:12.112 --> 01:31:13.352]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:31:13.833 --> 01:31:18.295]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:31:18.736 --> 01:31:22.698]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:31:23.238 --> 01:31:29.119]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:31:29.379 --> 01:31:35.480]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:36.580]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:42.241]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:31:42.681 --> 01:31:45.062]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:31:45.082 --> 01:31:45.402]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:31:53.742 --> 01:31:59.386]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.368 --> 01:32:08.472]  Alright, we're going to go back to Ellen Mariani here in just a few minutes and we'll talk to Roger and Mark and Don and others.
[01:32:08.492 --> 01:32:16.837]  Before we go back to Ellen, my friends, if we don't expose who was behind 9-11, the globalists are going to take over.
[01:32:17.778 --> 01:32:18.958]  The New World Order is going to win.
[01:32:19.239 --> 01:32:20.219]  They're going to use 9-11.
[01:32:22.068 --> 01:32:24.730]  To totally dismantle the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:25.951]  Frankly, that's already happened.
[01:32:26.751 --> 01:32:41.461]  With the bill they passed a month ago, the forced psychological testing, the military on the streets, the Patriot Act II, the National ID Card, face scanning cameras, cameras that scan your license plates, but none of that on the border.
[01:32:42.221 --> 01:32:43.122]  Total control.
[01:32:43.762 --> 01:32:46.704]  This is their pretext to scare us into submission.
[01:32:47.745 --> 01:32:50.146]  If we do not expose what really happened on 9-11, it's over.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:55.483]  Now, in a Zogby poll, half of New Yorkers believe the government was behind 9-11.
[01:32:56.183 --> 01:32:59.766]  Sixty-six percent think there was prior knowledge and there should be a new investigation.
[01:33:01.347 --> 01:33:04.330]  The 9-11 Whitewash Commission was appointed by Lord Bush.
[01:33:05.491 --> 01:33:06.812]  We document this.
[01:33:06.892 --> 01:33:10.394]  We cover what really happened on 9-11.
[01:33:11.635 --> 01:33:20.102]  And in other examples of government-sponsored terror, in my two 9-11 films, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and part two of that, The Masters of Terror.
[01:33:21.172 --> 01:33:23.833]  I also carry George Humphrey's 9-11-11 video.
[01:33:23.853 --> 01:33:29.616]  9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[01:33:30.776 --> 01:33:32.837]  I also carry Eric Hubschman's video.
[01:33:32.857 --> 01:33:34.878]  9-11, Painful Deceptions.
[01:33:35.418 --> 01:33:37.439]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny.

[01:33:40.400 --> 01:33:42.581]  Elite Sponsored Terror and the New World Order.

[01:33:53.586 --> 01:33:55.147]  Get them!
[01:33:55.567 --> 01:33:56.027]  Watch them!
[01:33:56.367 --> 01:33:56.687]  Read them!
[01:33:56.928 --> 01:33:58.108]  Then give them as gifts!
[01:33:58.549 --> 01:34:00.270]  Make copies of my videos!

[01:34:11.797 --> 01:34:13.358]  This is how we're gonna win!
[01:34:13.938 --> 01:34:14.799]  By exposing!
[01:34:14.839 --> 01:34:16.660]  So when the globalists blow something else up,
[01:34:17.358 --> 01:34:25.346]  And by exposing them, they could back off, but if they do, then people are at least going to know who stands to gain, and that giving up liberty doesn't keep us safe.
[01:34:25.966 --> 01:34:28.329]  And you can say, oh, there's nothing we can do, they're too powerful.
[01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:30.851]  If you have that attitude, we're cooked, folks.
[01:34:31.272 --> 01:34:34.515]  We can turn things around with God's help.
[01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.838]  But, you've got to take action.
[01:34:39.159 --> 01:34:40.981]  So, call toll-free to get my films.
[01:34:41.001 --> 01:34:42.161]  1-888-253-3139.

[01:34:50.368 --> 01:34:51.529]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:57.634]  Take Road to Tyranny.
[01:34:57.694 --> 01:34:58.875]  Buy one at regular price.
[01:34:58.895 --> 01:34:59.635]  Each additional copy, $5.95.
[01:35:00.736 --> 01:35:01.957]  I don't make any money on that.
[01:35:02.337 --> 01:35:05.360]  The point is to get the information out to people.
[01:35:05.994 --> 01:35:08.476]  I can't tell you how many victims
[01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:36.333]  Family members I've talked to of 9-11 who woke up because you gave them a copy of my video, listeners.
[01:35:37.053 --> 01:35:40.635]  I can't tell you the effects you've already had, and I want to commend you.
[01:35:41.075 --> 01:35:49.199]  Ellen Mariani, some good places to read some of the things you've documented in your lawsuits and the criminal complaint, Elliot Spitzer.
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:52.741]  A good place to check that out is Tom Flacco's website, isn't it?
[01:35:52.981 --> 01:35:53.562]  That's correct.
[01:35:53.602 --> 01:35:54.882]  TomFlacco.com.
[01:35:55.323 --> 01:35:57.464]  Scroll down to two to three of the letters.
[01:35:58.075 --> 01:36:10.083]  That he was with me and saw how I was treated in the court system of the state of New Hampshire and also in the federal courts of New York, where they did throw it out, my wrongful death, which was December 20, 2001.
[01:36:10.243 --> 01:36:11.363]  Both attorneys, number one,
[01:36:14.361 --> 01:36:16.782]  Nolan, number two Schiavo, sat there.
[01:36:16.802 --> 01:36:21.983]  Nolan manipulated with Kenneth Feinberg behind my back.
[01:36:22.044 --> 01:36:22.904]  I have proof of that.
[01:36:22.944 --> 01:36:23.784]  I've got the letter.
[01:36:24.644 --> 01:36:27.745]  Mary Schiavo sat in a private, secret meeting before that.
[01:36:28.085 --> 01:36:29.806]  She sat there while they threw it out.
[01:36:29.906 --> 01:36:32.267]  She never intervened, objected, nothing.
[01:36:32.287 --> 01:36:37.468]  In the meantime, she quit using another excuse and nasty words against me.
[01:36:37.508 --> 01:36:38.969]  But I want to read something here.
[01:36:41.283 --> 01:36:51.909]  After the Greenberg Tri-Rig, which is President Bush's private attorneys in Boston, found an attorney for the stepdaughter, they went in and plunked another lawsuit aside of mine.
[01:36:52.749 --> 01:37:01.294]  And the judge's orders were, if this doesn't get settled, and some problem arises, I have to intervene.
[01:37:02.352 --> 01:37:10.717]  So they were going to do no matter what they could, and it all started probably after 22 days of me putting the RICO in by Phil Bergman, the third attorney.
[01:37:11.658 --> 01:37:12.478]  How do you like that?
[01:37:12.598 --> 01:37:13.519]  That's in writing.
[01:37:13.899 --> 01:37:15.240]  The court's conversation.
[01:37:15.640 --> 01:37:22.664]  Well, Ellen, I'm impressed by your information and your tenacity, but when I had Berg on, he was saying he thought the government was behind the attacks.
[01:37:23.265 --> 01:37:31.930]  He seemed pretty credible, but if they brought him in there and said, look, we're throwing this out anyways, is it bad that he tried to settle something?
[01:37:32.900 --> 01:37:35.462]  He was not... I am in charge of my lawsuit.
[01:37:35.562 --> 01:37:37.543]  I know my lawsuit better than any attorney.
[01:37:37.563 --> 01:37:38.224]  No, I understand.
[01:37:38.244 --> 01:37:50.392]  You're saying that he went in there and... And he did not go and talk to me of what he did behind my back with this brand new attorney from Boston, Capace, who the Greenberg and Treiberg somehow got their stepdaughter involved in.
[01:37:50.733 --> 01:37:58.278]  And then also another attorney they got involved with in New Hampshire who is an insurance attorney who represents all insurance companies.
[01:37:58.859 --> 01:38:05.270]  Now, this Greenberg & Tryward Company has two lawyers who represent United Airlines.
[01:38:05.290 --> 01:38:07.854]  Do you see the web that's being weaved?
[01:38:07.914 --> 01:38:10.919]  No, I understand this is hundreds of billions of dollars.
[01:38:11.687 --> 01:38:14.269]  And it was a very profitable enterprise for the globalists.
[01:38:15.009 --> 01:38:17.611]  The airlines got $25 billion free.
[01:38:17.991 --> 01:38:24.276]  They could have all flown for, what was it, four or five years without ever charging any fee and still made money.
[01:38:24.296 --> 01:38:31.241]  They used it as an excuse to lay people off and restrict routes and it became quite a boon for them.
[01:38:31.301 --> 01:38:33.002]  Alex, they got my stepdaughter.
[01:38:33.482 --> 01:38:38.688]  The only heir, Neil Mariani's daughter, to start going against me as the enemy.
[01:38:38.728 --> 01:38:40.671]  She had approved for me being the administrate.
[01:38:41.011 --> 01:38:47.478]  Then I started getting interderogatory questions, requests for production of documents.
[01:38:47.498 --> 01:38:52.064]  22 days after I had, with Spielberg, put in a RICO lawsuit.
[01:38:52.512 --> 01:38:57.935]  Well yeah, you're still in the president for 9-11 and it's going to be serious stuff you're up against.
[01:38:58.276 --> 01:39:05.960]  Now in the lawsuit, you went through a lot of key points of evidence of government complicity.
[01:39:06.881 --> 01:39:08.022]  I do not know the law.
[01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:10.103]  I trusted my attorney.
[01:39:11.024 --> 01:39:13.105]  Two of them, I'm sorry.
[01:39:13.857 --> 01:39:16.878]  They did not stand up for their clients.
[01:39:16.898 --> 01:39:18.739]  Well, now where are you going in the future with this?
[01:39:18.759 --> 01:39:22.541]  Now I am not going to have to trust Phil Berg.
[01:39:22.801 --> 01:39:24.162]  He went behind my back.
[01:39:24.782 --> 01:39:27.183]  I understand that, Ellen, but now what are you going to do?
[01:39:27.343 --> 01:39:29.584]  Wait a minute, let me finish, Alex.
[01:39:30.405 --> 01:39:39.629]  He went to and got an agreement signed that I would give up my Administrex that I'd worked three long, sad years with, and I said no.
[01:39:40.672 --> 01:39:45.535]  Well, they used Phil Berg as doing errors in the New York Courthouse.
[01:39:46.356 --> 01:39:52.339]  What the error is they used to get me to sign off was Phil Berg as a Pennsylvania attorney.
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:40:03.126]  What was he doing representing me without a ProHack DC, which means you have to have a New York attorney represent you in the federal courts of New York against United Airlines.
[01:40:03.526 --> 01:40:09.470]  He went in there on his own, the 32-year-old, I mean, year lawyer,
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:15.504]  He knew when he came to New Hampshire he had to be approved under a New Hampshire attorney.
[01:40:15.564 --> 01:40:16.524]  Why did he do that?
[01:40:17.325 --> 01:40:19.186]  So they used that as an excuse.
[01:40:19.707 --> 01:40:21.528]  I'm going to read you two words.
[01:40:22.489 --> 01:40:27.212]  It appears that, upon information and belief, Ms.
[01:40:27.272 --> 01:40:34.077]  Mariani's lawsuit did not include all the potential defendants and service of process is defective.
[01:40:34.097 --> 01:40:34.417]  Are they serious?
[01:40:34.912 --> 01:40:36.412]  Are they going against any attorneys?
[01:40:36.773 --> 01:40:37.073]  No.
[01:40:37.513 --> 01:40:38.993]  But that was their excuse.
[01:40:39.093 --> 01:40:40.214]  I have it in writing.
[01:40:41.074 --> 01:40:42.934]  That's why they wanted me to step down.
[01:40:43.074 --> 01:40:46.515]  I lost my dead husband's rights as the administrator.
[01:40:47.216 --> 01:40:47.776]  They did it.
[01:40:48.076 --> 01:40:48.816]  They lied.
[01:40:49.156 --> 01:40:51.797]  They put me through hell for over a year.
[01:40:52.217 --> 01:40:58.559]  And they got their way thanks to this corrupt judicial system in our United States.
[01:40:58.779 --> 01:41:02.260]  Ellen, that's just terrible, but what are you going to do now?
[01:41:04.309 --> 01:41:05.069]  I can't tell you.
[01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:07.691]  I never give up.
[01:41:08.931 --> 01:41:09.771]  I won't give up.
[01:41:10.412 --> 01:41:18.375]  You know, if I gave up, I probably... You know, a lot of people in the courts have put innocent people in jail, prison.
[01:41:18.995 --> 01:41:19.656]  It is sick!
[01:41:20.076 --> 01:41:22.197]  How many innocent people are in there?
[01:41:22.257 --> 01:41:22.977]  They can't vote.
[01:41:23.037 --> 01:41:23.778]  They can't speak.
[01:41:23.818 --> 01:41:25.018]  They've given up their rights.
[01:41:25.678 --> 01:41:27.019]  This is a crime!
[01:41:28.027 --> 01:41:29.708]  It's got to stop, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:30.188 --> 01:41:31.228]  You've got to walk with me.
[01:41:31.429 --> 01:41:44.995]  Listen, I hardly agree with you that things are out of control in this country across the board and the courts are just in a horrible state of affairs and it's just getting worse and worse and worse.
[01:41:45.015 --> 01:41:53.839]  But there are a lot of other families that have been going public, Ellen, a lot of other widows and widowers saying they're not buying the official story.
[01:41:54.339 --> 01:41:56.620]  What are they up to right now when you're in contact with them?
[01:41:57.463 --> 01:41:58.063]  I don't know.
[01:41:58.343 --> 01:42:02.844]  Everybody feels their loss is so severe they can't talk about it.
[01:42:03.244 --> 01:42:05.445]  A lot of them will not talk about it.
[01:42:07.345 --> 01:42:10.326]  They're waiting to see what Alan Mariani is up to.
[01:42:10.906 --> 01:42:14.767]  Well, that's okay, but their case is their loss.
[01:42:15.187 --> 01:42:20.528]  Well, they also take out of the thousands and thousands of family members, they take four or five
[01:42:21.252 --> 01:42:36.837]  people and trot them out to push for the Patriot Act and to push for the police state and then it'll be in the back of the news wire you know hundreds of families rallying saying don't use our our loved ones names to sell your system.
[01:42:37.357 --> 01:42:39.557]  Well who used it?
[01:42:40.298 --> 01:42:48.380]  The government used it to promote themselves you know it was for a public support for a war on terrorism I find that distasteful
[01:42:49.096 --> 01:42:54.418]  So, it isn't them taking out the families, it was the parties that did this.
[01:42:55.078 --> 01:42:59.580]  And it is my personal belief that they intentionally allowed September 11th to happen.
[01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:01.461]  And that was for political gain.
[01:43:01.941 --> 01:43:06.763]  And, you know, our American dreams of freedom have been shattered for the future.
[01:43:08.383 --> 01:43:09.364]  I know it's hard for you.
[01:43:09.404 --> 01:43:10.644]  We appreciate your courage.
[01:43:12.045 --> 01:43:15.386]  It's just amazing to see all of this unfolding.
[01:43:16.204 --> 01:43:17.505]  I want to say something here.
[01:43:18.085 --> 01:43:24.987]  I was given by two attorneys, Mary Schiavo and Don Nolan, Terrorism Lipton Report.
[01:43:25.087 --> 01:43:27.068]  If people could ever go to the Lipton Report.
[01:43:27.508 --> 01:43:29.849]  It started in 1979.
[01:43:30.369 --> 01:43:31.670]  Aftermath of terrorism.
[01:43:31.730 --> 01:43:33.350]  Terrorism deaths increased.
[01:43:33.390 --> 01:43:35.431]  Terrorism updates.
[01:43:35.451 --> 01:43:36.892]  The 82 terrorist activities.
[01:43:37.512 --> 01:43:37.932]  Threats.
[01:43:38.532 --> 01:43:39.953]  Targets of U.S.
[01:43:40.013 --> 01:43:40.593]  businesses.
[01:43:40.773 --> 01:43:43.274]  This is back in 79.
[01:43:43.554 --> 01:43:45.155]  What are they lying to us for?
[01:43:48.042 --> 01:43:49.144]  I don't quite take your point.
[01:43:49.284 --> 01:43:52.187]  The point is the terrorism started way back.
[01:43:53.449 --> 01:43:54.810]  Way back in 1979.
[01:43:55.591 --> 01:43:56.952]  I have the report.
[01:43:57.293 --> 01:43:59.135]  The Lipton Report states this.
[01:44:00.239 --> 01:44:12.306]  Well, terrorism's been going on longer than that, and there were over 300 terrorist bombings in America in the 60s and 70s, and Bill Clinton released people who killed police officers.
[01:44:13.146 --> 01:44:17.569]  That was some of the folks that he gave clemency when he left office.
[01:44:18.329 --> 01:44:21.071]  You know, if my husband could speak today, which he can't,
[01:44:21.781 --> 01:44:31.663]  He would ask our court, our judicial system, why did he have to die in such a shameful way on the soil he protected in the Air Force for four years.
[01:44:32.223 --> 01:44:33.723]  He did not abandon it, me.
[01:44:35.184 --> 01:44:35.684]  They did.
[01:44:35.844 --> 01:44:41.925]  United Airlines did, and our government has, for not protecting us.
[01:44:43.185 --> 01:44:45.586]  And that's how I feel if he could speak today.
[01:44:48.246 --> 01:44:51.327]  Well, what do you think of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission?
[01:44:53.900 --> 01:45:02.763]  Well, until they bring them all in and publicize it publicly, okay, we're never going to know the truth.
[01:45:02.843 --> 01:45:12.007]  We cannot allow them to go through side doors, back doors, and then those people like the 9-11 Commission, is that what you're talking about?
[01:45:12.507 --> 01:45:13.207]  Oh, yes, the 9-11 Commission.
[01:45:13.227 --> 01:45:15.648]  Well, they were all connected with some type of
[01:45:16.644 --> 01:45:24.167]  Employment or hirements from previous government or that government and we were not, I was not expecting anything good.
[01:45:24.187 --> 01:45:26.829]  Chairman Keene was in business with the Bin Laden family.
[01:45:26.869 --> 01:45:27.189]  Correct.
[01:45:27.869 --> 01:45:33.251]  And the head staffer for the committee, you know, was writing national security books with Connelisa Rice.
[01:45:33.271 --> 01:45:38.254]  I mean, they tried to have Henry Kissinger be the independent chairman at the first.
[01:45:38.314 --> 01:45:39.234]  I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:45:40.555 --> 01:45:42.696]  Well, we need to bring them all before the
[01:45:44.048 --> 01:45:46.190]  Well, I would say this.
[01:45:46.251 --> 01:45:54.280]  If we had a real grand jury that wasn't a rubber stamp of the prosecutors at a state or federal grand jury, they could bring this whole thing down.
[01:45:54.700 --> 01:45:57.263]  It was a federal grand jury that hauled Bill Clinton into court.
[01:45:57.803 --> 01:45:58.424]  Exactly.
[01:45:58.664 --> 01:45:59.405]  Exactly.
[01:46:01.207 --> 01:46:02.569]  My husband was alive then.
[01:46:03.049 --> 01:46:04.371]  I'm not approving what he did.
[01:46:05.034 --> 01:46:18.116]  But if they want to go in the Tom Flocko, they will see where I wrote to the Judge Christina O'Neil and told in the end how I found out how the New Hampshire female attorney
[01:46:19.165 --> 01:46:25.611]  And all the rest of those attorneys on the other side with my stepdaughter and the Boston are all intertwined together.
[01:46:25.671 --> 01:46:31.075]  If they would go on TomFlaco.com, they will see all these stories where I was fighting.
[01:46:31.456 --> 01:46:33.197]  The hell they have put me through.
[01:46:33.758 --> 01:46:37.741]  If I have to do this to get the truth out, I'm glad I did it.
[01:46:39.085 --> 01:46:39.905]  Well, certainly.
[01:46:40.045 --> 01:46:47.469]  I mean, bottom line, you got a lot of the unanswered questions and answered questions out into a public venue.
[01:46:47.529 --> 01:46:51.691]  And so, you know, duty is ours, consequences are God's.
[01:46:52.451 --> 01:46:56.073]  And we've got a responsibility to tell the truth and do the right thing.
[01:46:57.274 --> 01:47:02.796]  But if the courts are hopelessly corrupt, what do you see happening in the future of America?
[01:47:04.997 --> 01:47:08.699]  I don't know, but I want to tell you what the children hope happens in our country.
[01:47:09.375 --> 01:47:10.075]  I don't know.
[01:47:10.095 --> 01:47:11.176]  This is from a little girl.
[01:47:11.696 --> 01:47:13.957]  Actually, it's my granddaughter in the Carolinas.
[01:47:14.338 --> 01:47:19.761]  I don't know what tomorrow holds, but I know who holds tomorrow, and it's all those children.
[01:47:20.261 --> 01:47:22.302]  That's what we're working and fighting for.
[01:47:22.322 --> 01:47:25.384]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:47:25.424 --> 01:47:29.746]  Have you heard of the new Freedom Initiative, where they're going to forcibly, psychologically test all the children?
[01:47:30.993 --> 01:47:31.974]  There we go again!
[01:47:32.394 --> 01:47:35.876]  We have to probably go back to homeschooling, where we have rights.
[01:47:35.996 --> 01:47:43.260]  My grandmother brought me up and said, if you want to have your children be your own, you put them in private schools.
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:46.282]  I'm sorry, because once you put them in a government school, they're not yours.
[01:47:46.743 --> 01:47:53.867]  There is one more thing I want to say, that I feel this government has covered up the truth from day one.
[01:47:54.736 --> 01:48:02.558]  And she used to say to me how I had been treated through these courts thinking I was the murderer of my husband and everybody else on September 11th.
[01:48:03.058 --> 01:48:04.718]  I kept thinking of what she said to me.
[01:48:05.399 --> 01:48:12.360]  What has this judicial system done or is doing to be so suspicious of us?
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:13.801]  I, a 9-11 widow.
[01:48:14.141 --> 01:48:14.941]  What are they doing?
[01:48:15.561 --> 01:48:22.643]  Okay, everybody has to start screaming to these television stations who are members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:48:23.043 --> 01:48:23.703]  They have blocked
[01:48:24.247 --> 01:48:29.010]  All news that we want to hear to their way, to the government's way.
[01:48:29.050 --> 01:48:29.951]  And it has to stop.
[01:48:29.991 --> 01:48:31.091]  That's where we have to start.
[01:48:32.112 --> 01:48:32.972]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:48:33.012 --> 01:48:33.653]  It's out of control.
[01:48:33.673 --> 01:48:38.516]  People can read some of the great analysis about your suit and about the criminal complaints.
[01:48:38.936 --> 01:48:40.937]  They can check that out at TomFlacco.com.
[01:48:41.518 --> 01:48:48.222]  And Ellen, if folks want to get in contact with you or want to support you or want to give you any advice, is there a way people can talk to you?
[01:48:48.242 --> 01:48:50.683]  They can go through TomFlacco.com.
[01:48:50.723 --> 01:48:51.964]  He has stood by me
[01:48:52.922 --> 01:48:56.425]  Watch what they haven't done in the court system, how I've been persecuted.
[01:48:57.085 --> 01:48:59.607]  Tom has really been a great investigative reporter.
[01:48:59.707 --> 01:49:03.850]  I mean, he's out there working six, seven days a week on 9-11.
[01:49:04.130 --> 01:49:06.992]  I want to tell you a little tiny second about Tom.
[01:49:07.052 --> 01:49:12.656]  Tom lost a son in another country, not very far from the United States, called Mexico.
[01:49:13.336 --> 01:49:19.641]  He has tried through our judicial system to get justice, like I'm trying, and they threw his out!
[01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:23.012]  Now, you're going to find out there is definitely something wrong here.
[01:49:23.052 --> 01:49:23.912]  We need to clean house.
[01:49:25.854 --> 01:49:27.095]  The criminals run the country.
[01:49:27.175 --> 01:49:29.016]  Ellen Mariani, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:49:29.136 --> 01:49:30.097]  You're welcome, Alex.
[01:49:30.217 --> 01:49:30.637]  Thank you.
[01:49:30.677 --> 01:49:32.798]  Please tell your audience to walk with me.
[01:49:33.319 --> 01:49:33.959]  God bless you.
[01:49:33.999 --> 01:49:34.319]  Take care.
[01:49:34.339 --> 01:49:34.660]  Thank you.
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:35.600]  Bye-bye.
[01:49:35.740 --> 01:49:36.541]  What a sweet lady.
[01:49:36.561 --> 01:49:38.322]  Going through a lot of pain right now, folks.
[01:49:38.943 --> 01:49:40.684]  The pain that the New World Order has inflicted.
[01:49:41.284 --> 01:49:43.966]  We'll come back and talk to Roger, Mark, Don, and others.
[01:49:44.666 --> 01:49:45.347]  Ton of news.
[01:49:45.427 --> 01:49:46.968]  A whole third hour coming up as well.
[01:49:52.948 --> 01:49:57.814]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.015 --> 01:50:02.340]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:05.398 --> 01:50:06.959]  A new world order.
[01:50:06.999 --> 01:50:07.159]  Panama.
[01:50:07.199 --> 01:50:08.379]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.703 --> 01:50:34.291]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, Force Vaccinations, The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan-American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.471 --> 01:50:39.855]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:52:39.108 --> 01:52:42.210]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.370 --> 01:52:48.314]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:52:53.377 --> 01:53:00.381]  Roger, Mark, Don, David, Lane, everybody, your calls are coming up right now.
[01:53:01.201 --> 01:53:03.422]  Let's go ahead and talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:53:03.442 --> 01:53:04.163]  Roger, go ahead.
[01:53:05.461 --> 01:53:06.121]  Yeah, thanks.
[01:53:06.341 --> 01:53:06.702]  You got me?
[01:53:07.062 --> 01:53:07.802]  Yeah, sure do.
[01:53:08.142 --> 01:53:08.803]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:53:08.843 --> 01:53:09.403]  Come on, Alan.
[01:53:09.443 --> 01:53:10.143]  I suppose you're next.
[01:53:10.223 --> 01:53:13.685]  You're going to tell us that Hitler's Nazis started the Reichstag fire, huh?
[01:53:14.446 --> 01:53:26.311]  Hey, but I would have loved to ask, or maybe she could call back, respond to this, but what does she make of those carefully tripled, or yourself as well, those carefully triple-screened, hand-selected, 911
[01:53:28.243 --> 01:53:35.545]  Family of victims staff whose pictures were trotted out in all the newspapers to prop agendize for that worthless... Well, that's what I mentioned to her.
[01:53:35.565 --> 01:53:47.829]  I mean, you've literally got thousands of people that have marched around the White House, victims, with signs saying, Bush did it, Bush knew, years ago, but all you ever see is four or five families being trotted out everywhere.
[01:53:48.189 --> 01:53:54.171]  Yeah, that worthless no-job-of-an-intelligence fellow, McLaughlin, said you'll never hear from them again.
[01:53:54.191 --> 01:53:57.072]  Has anyone got to interview any of them?
[01:54:00.696 --> 01:54:06.251]  Are they a particularly credulous group of sycophants or just bought off or what?
[01:54:07.512 --> 01:54:10.855]  Well, a lot of people are just ignorant and trust their government.
[01:54:10.955 --> 01:54:14.777]  I mean, you know, but I'm a good person, so everybody else must be good in the world.
[01:54:14.797 --> 01:54:16.319]  Thanks for the call, Roger.
[01:54:16.599 --> 01:54:18.380]  Alex, I have two unconnected items.
[01:54:18.440 --> 01:54:23.584]  I've been wanting to call this point with a bunch of the guests over the last week on the Alberto Gonzalez Attorney General appointment.
[01:54:23.604 --> 01:54:28.768]  That is the part about where he said that Bush doesn't have to follow unconstitutional laws.
[01:54:28.828 --> 01:54:34.152]  Now, you recall that Dr. Stan Monteith is one of some 10 or 15 Christians who got to vet
[01:54:35.115 --> 01:54:50.499]  DW in private in his first pre-primary asked George if he would veto unconstitutional laws, and as he says, George sat back in his chair, sat back some more and some more, finally responding, I don't understand the question.
[01:54:51.479 --> 01:54:56.020]  Yeah, let me just stop you there, Roger, and thanks for the call.
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:04.362]  Look, to say that, well, we're going to torture people up until the time they die, and then it's not our fault until they have organ failure and die,
[01:55:05.051 --> 01:55:07.172]  And we can bury people alive and drown them.
[01:55:07.212 --> 01:55:08.313]  I mean, this was all listed.
[01:55:09.074 --> 01:55:17.079]  And to say then, uh, so we don't have to follow the federal law against torturing someone to death because it could be unconstitutional.
[01:55:17.679 --> 01:55:20.061]  His memo just said the law flows from Bush.
[01:55:20.441 --> 01:55:21.922]  Bush is absolute dictator.
[01:55:22.538 --> 01:55:24.219]  Okay, that's what he said.
[01:55:24.539 --> 01:55:33.502]  And then the spin is, well, if it's unconstitutional, but I take your point of how it's a fraud at another level, and I am familiar with Dr. Stan Monteith talking about that.
[01:55:34.182 --> 01:55:36.263]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:55:36.803 --> 01:55:37.724]  Mark in Ohio.
[01:55:37.764 --> 01:55:38.404]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:55:39.224 --> 01:55:48.888]  Yes, Alex, I'm extremely moved by Ellen Mariani's testimony there, and I just want to let you know that as far as Cincinnati, Ohio is concerned,
[01:55:49.369 --> 01:55:56.854]  I've been kind of sitting on top of this, and I do apologize, but if I have anything to get done, I mean, it's going to be done now.
[01:55:57.074 --> 01:55:59.136]  I mean, we've got to get justice for this lady.
[01:55:59.536 --> 01:56:01.737]  I mean, it's just, this has got to be exposed.
[01:56:19.833 --> 01:56:21.194]  I don't accept one bit of this.
[01:56:21.674 --> 01:56:23.435]  And I just want to give you a heads up on this.
[01:56:23.495 --> 01:56:24.916]  I don't know if you heard about this or not.
[01:56:24.956 --> 01:56:29.598]  I was like listening to a radio station here in Cincinnati, Ohio and I just caught the end of it.
[01:56:29.618 --> 01:56:38.603]  It sounded like they were talking about some Pentagon papers that were leaked or something that they were actually experimenting on certain biological weapons.
[01:56:39.324 --> 01:56:45.827]  One of them was actually supposed to actually give the quote-unquote homosexual sex.
[01:56:46.347 --> 01:56:46.768]  Yeah!
[01:56:47.608 --> 01:56:49.089]  I mean, this is just crazy!
[01:56:50.034 --> 01:56:52.936]  I mean, this is... I'm just dumbfounded.
[01:56:52.956 --> 01:56:54.476]  I mean, they're turning us into monsters.
[01:56:55.237 --> 01:57:00.419]  And I can't imagine a whole bunch of neocons out there going, they're thinking that's just funnier than hell.
[01:57:01.359 --> 01:57:09.983]  Well, what it is, is they'll use our private money to develop an aphrodisiac and then actually patent it and sell it to the public.
[01:57:10.243 --> 01:57:17.587]  But yeah, it was to spray troops with a mind control drug that makes the men start having intercourse.
[01:57:18.493 --> 01:57:24.158]  Well, that's Christian and conservative.
[01:57:25.259 --> 01:57:28.862]  Well, they'll probably start using it on our... flying over our cities with it.
[01:57:28.882 --> 01:57:30.684]  Well, that's where the Christian conservatives do their thing.
[01:57:30.724 --> 01:57:31.805]  The false Christian conservatives.
[01:57:31.825 --> 01:57:32.305]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:50.024 --> 01:57:50.664]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.324 --> 01:57:52.385]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.085 --> 01:57:54.206]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.846 --> 01:57:55.686]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.447 --> 01:57:57.947]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.987 --> 01:58:01.829]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.169 --> 01:58:06.311]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.292 --> 01:58:09.653]  Alright, my friends.
[01:58:10.393 --> 01:58:13.274]  Already into hour number three.
[01:58:13.755 --> 01:58:16.556]  The 14th day of January 2005.
[01:58:19.005 --> 01:58:20.066]  Year of our Lord.
[01:58:21.927 --> 01:58:25.249]  Don and David and Elaine and others, your calls are coming up momentarily.
[01:58:25.610 --> 01:58:26.070]  And you know what?
[01:58:26.150 --> 01:58:27.791]  I just want to do this and I'm going to do it.
[01:58:28.191 --> 01:58:30.173]  I have a bunch of news I'm going to mention, little tidbits.
[01:58:30.673 --> 01:58:32.975]  Like what the caller just mentioned at the end of the hour.
[01:58:33.595 --> 01:58:38.579]  They've got these gases they want to spray on foreign troops to make them have homosexual sex.
[01:58:40.160 --> 01:58:41.761]  And all of this has dual uses.
[01:58:41.801 --> 01:58:44.663]  Whenever they're testing on foreign countries, they've already tested here.
[01:58:46.241 --> 01:58:49.003]  Again, the government's tested lethal stuff on the population.
[01:58:49.043 --> 01:58:53.946]  That's how cold-blooded some of the globalists are and some of their minions are.
[01:58:55.487 --> 01:58:57.068]  But yeah, that's the type of news I've got here.
[01:58:57.128 --> 01:58:59.329]  Just a big, fat stack of it.
[01:58:59.349 --> 01:59:00.850]  But I want to take a lot of your calls.
[01:59:01.491 --> 01:59:05.613]  But to do that, I'm going to give each caller a minute or two, and we're going to move to the next person.
[01:59:05.633 --> 01:59:05.693]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:10.942 --> 01:59:12.603]  Let's talk to Don in Pennsylvania.
[01:59:12.643 --> 01:59:13.264]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:59:13.704 --> 01:59:14.185]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:14.225 --> 01:59:15.806]  Thanks for having my call today.
[01:59:15.826 --> 01:59:16.306]  Thank you.
[01:59:17.347 --> 01:59:22.071]  Just real briefly, I'm still carrying some ads in my publication around Crawford County and it's getting bigger each day.
[01:59:23.072 --> 01:59:26.475]  Secondly, how do I spell Flocko as in TomFlocko.com?
[01:59:27.315 --> 01:59:27.676]  I don't know.
[01:59:27.736 --> 01:59:31.198]  Just type Tom Flocko into the search engine and it'll correct the spelling for you.
[01:59:31.339 --> 01:59:33.480]  F-L-A-C-O dot com?
[01:59:33.841 --> 01:59:34.221]  I don't know.
[01:59:35.402 --> 01:59:35.982]  Okay, I'll try that.
[01:59:37.506 --> 01:59:40.388]  Secondly, for your mailing address, it's 3001 South Lamar?
[01:59:40.788 --> 01:59:41.229]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:41.249 --> 01:59:47.233]  It's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:59:50.015 --> 01:59:47.233]  78704?
[01:59:50.155 --> 01:59:50.536]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:50.976 --> 02:00:04.126]  And, um, I have some information that folks who want to take a peaceable approach at us, getting our government back, if you would like to see my plan, I won't charge anybody anything, but if they'll give me their, um, a name and a mailing address they want me to send it to,
[02:00:05.069 --> 02:00:06.069]  Can I give out my email address?
[02:00:06.089 --> 02:00:09.931]  You know, I don't have a problem with you calling, but every time you call, it's never about anything.
[02:00:09.991 --> 02:00:11.392]  It's just plugging this.
[02:00:12.192 --> 02:00:12.793]  Okay, yes sir.
[02:00:12.873 --> 02:00:15.174]  Did you see what happened last night on the news?
[02:00:16.034 --> 02:00:16.514]  A C-SPAN.
[02:00:16.874 --> 02:00:17.275]  What happened?
[02:00:17.435 --> 02:00:17.995]  About 10.30, 11.00 PM.
[02:00:18.215 --> 02:00:19.716]  No, what happened?
[02:00:19.736 --> 02:00:20.576]  Vice President Cheney.
[02:00:21.636 --> 02:00:21.877]  Hello?
[02:00:22.157 --> 02:00:22.817]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:00:23.237 --> 02:00:26.959]  I'm sorry, Vice President Cheney came up and brought up the Social Security reforms.
[02:00:27.719 --> 02:00:28.099]  Yes.
[02:00:28.119 --> 02:00:31.561]  And it seems to me as if it's just another approach to take more money out of our paychecks.
[02:00:32.458 --> 02:00:34.479]  To support their whatever type of... Yeah, that's it.
[02:00:34.499 --> 02:00:38.000]  They're going to have a tax increase on Social Security and cut benefits.
[02:00:38.320 --> 02:00:38.480]  Yes.
[02:00:39.160 --> 02:00:41.801]  And, um, since you said you only had a minute, I didn't want to waste your time, sir.
[02:00:41.861 --> 02:00:51.464]  That's why I don't... No, I'm not griping at you, but, um, you know... It's just, you call about once a month, and it's always, here's my newsletter, here's my website.
[02:00:51.664 --> 02:00:53.045]  Sure, go ahead, tell us about it.
[02:00:53.445 --> 02:00:59.587]  Okay, well, um, about which one of the... the plan, or what happened on the news last night, on C-SPAN?
[02:01:03.423 --> 02:01:09.485]  Well, basically, I believe that we as the value producers of this country, we can peaceably take this country back.
[02:01:09.545 --> 02:01:11.365]  And that's why I plug this about once a month, sir.
[02:01:11.426 --> 02:01:18.888]  No, no, I agree with you that the boycott and spending our money with people and organizations is a great idea and it takes discipline.
[02:01:20.106 --> 02:01:20.887]  What was the website?
[02:01:21.047 --> 02:01:22.128]  It was a website, wasn't it?
[02:01:22.728 --> 02:01:25.150]  Um, actually though, I don't know anything about the website.
[02:01:25.210 --> 02:01:30.415]  I have a Yahoo Groups plan called, uh, a Yahoo Groups group called Braveheart411.
[02:01:30.435 --> 02:01:32.056]  Yeah, that's a website.
[02:01:32.116 --> 02:01:33.117]  That's a webpage.
[02:01:33.257 --> 02:01:33.577]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:33.617 --> 02:01:33.878]  Yes, sir.
[02:01:34.478 --> 02:01:38.401]  Um, as far as any kind of boycotts or anything, that depends on who's submitted.
[02:01:39.643 --> 02:01:41.984]  Our different members submit different information, and um...
[02:01:43.608 --> 02:01:43.928]  Pardon me.
[02:01:43.948 --> 02:01:46.089]  No, there's nothing to pardon about.
[02:01:46.109 --> 02:01:46.929]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:47.149 --> 02:01:57.293]  Now, listen, when we get back, I'm really going to try to keep the callers down to about a minute, a minute and a half, and I just want to hear your comment, your question, the news item that you want to talk about.
[02:01:58.214 --> 02:01:59.454]  It's really, really important.
[02:02:00.037 --> 02:02:04.079]  Because I want to bring up all these different angles and issues, and you guys do a great job of that.
[02:02:04.599 --> 02:02:06.460]  I'd like to hear from some of the ladies as well.
[02:02:07.421 --> 02:02:10.062]  So every time you hear a caller hang up, that's your chance to call in 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:10.082 --> 02:02:10.162]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:10.182 --> 02:02:11.763]  My websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net,
[02:02:25.535 --> 02:02:28.517]  PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:02:28.597 --> 02:02:39.824]  So, I am going to blitz, I'm going to move quick, I'm going to go to your calls, and I want to take about 25 calls before this broadcast ends in 55 minutes, 5 seconds.
[02:02:46.255 --> 02:02:53.637]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.897 --> 02:02:58.638]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.858 --> 02:03:04.500]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:05.120 --> 02:03:05.580]  I think?
[02:03:20.094 --> 02:03:20.574]  We're good to go.
[02:03:46.474 --> 02:03:50.978]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:51.318 --> 02:03:55.422]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.722 --> 02:03:56.263]  We listened.
[02:03:56.563 --> 02:04:01.548]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.828 --> 02:04:02.308]  We listened.
[02:04:02.689 --> 02:04:05.751]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:06.172 --> 02:04:06.692]  We listened.
[02:04:07.153 --> 02:04:10.696]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:04:10.796 --> 02:04:11.036]  I think?
[02:04:36.042 --> 02:04:48.571]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[02:04:49.311 --> 02:04:52.794]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[02:04:53.394 --> 02:04:56.916]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[02:04:57.597 --> 02:05:00.199]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[02:05:00.639 --> 02:05:03.041]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[02:05:03.561 --> 02:05:04.922]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[02:05:05.663 --> 02:05:07.384]  Is your life on hold to the spring?
[02:05:07.924 --> 02:05:08.884]  Check with your doctor.
[02:05:08.984 --> 02:05:13.906]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SADS, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[02:05:14.366 --> 02:05:19.107]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[02:05:19.727 --> 02:05:20.568]  Light up your life.
[02:05:20.668 --> 02:05:23.388]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with the Northern Light.
[02:05:23.929 --> 02:05:25.629]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066.
[02:05:28.863 --> 02:05:29.243]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.212 --> 02:05:52.273]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.993 --> 02:05:54.193]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.734 --> 02:05:55.574]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.314 --> 02:05:57.215]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.875 --> 02:06:01.497]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.077 --> 02:06:06.139]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.773 --> 02:06:22.558]  All right, I'm doing a news blitz and a call blitz in this third hour, into the second segment now, my friends.
[02:06:23.579 --> 02:06:24.659]  Some of the news that's coming up.
[02:06:25.040 --> 02:06:25.280]  U.S.
[02:06:25.320 --> 02:06:31.665]  Homeland Security chief calls for international biometric standards or World ID card.
[02:06:33.066 --> 02:06:37.930]  Also out of the New York Post, iFlights, iris scan for JFK passengers.
[02:06:38.451 --> 02:06:38.951]  Period.
[02:06:40.472 --> 02:06:44.696]  And little Prince Harry, you know, his
[02:06:46.403 --> 02:06:54.305]  Grandmother's brother, who was going to be the king, was a top Nazi, had to escape out of Germany while it was being bombed in Franco-Spain.
[02:06:55.025 --> 02:06:59.346]  Well, the Duchess of York says she's proud of him.
[02:06:59.446 --> 02:07:01.146]  That's the headline of This Is London.
[02:07:02.546 --> 02:07:04.227]  And Prince Charles says, leave him alone.
[02:07:05.447 --> 02:07:07.107]  Let him wear his little Nazi outfit.
[02:07:08.208 --> 02:07:10.668]  It'd be one thing if they didn't have such a Nazi past.
[02:07:10.928 --> 02:07:13.929]  And also, This Is London came out with an article and said, well,
[02:07:15.385 --> 02:07:17.687]  Britons don't like to talk about it, but it's true.
[02:07:18.087 --> 02:07:19.668]  We do have German rulers.
[02:07:20.869 --> 02:07:24.031]  But don't feel bad, we've got the Bushes here, the Nazi German rulers.
[02:07:24.331 --> 02:07:26.893]  And we'll soon have Schwarzenegger, a grade A one.
[02:07:26.953 --> 02:07:29.014]  So we'll all be getting our German leaders.
[02:07:30.275 --> 02:07:33.297]  It's all part of the new freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:33.557 --> 02:07:36.880]  Pentagon reveals its chemical weapons program.
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:41.403]  Gay gas makes men have uncontrollable homosexual sex.
[02:07:42.263 --> 02:07:45.384]  It's part of a spearheaded program by George Bush.
[02:07:45.404 --> 02:07:46.185]  Very proud of it.
[02:07:46.965 --> 02:07:48.665]  And it's very conservative.
[02:07:50.186 --> 02:07:51.066]  What more can I say?
[02:07:51.607 --> 02:07:53.747]  David in San Francisco, you're on the air.
[02:07:53.787 --> 02:07:54.268]  Go ahead.
[02:07:54.888 --> 02:07:56.588]  Hey, greetings, Alex.
[02:07:56.628 --> 02:07:58.389]  Man, there's like layers of stories.
[02:07:58.549 --> 02:08:08.173]  I don't know if with that Nazi pass to the British, there's a pretty interesting book that came out a year or so ago called Royal Babylon.
[02:08:09.429 --> 02:08:24.232]  It goes into some detail about the king that abdicated for the woman that he loved, and it turns out that he was just a Nazi after all, and that was the excuse they fed to the public.
[02:08:26.193 --> 02:08:31.814]  It's kind of interesting to see which side these royalists fall out on.
[02:08:32.678 --> 02:08:38.162]  Well, it's like Prince Bernhardt, the head of the Netherlands, who founded the Bilderberg Group.
[02:08:38.462 --> 02:08:39.943]  He was an SS colonel.
[02:08:41.384 --> 02:08:44.706]  Kurt Waldheim, head of the UN, they knew he was a top Nazi.
[02:08:45.647 --> 02:08:49.149]  And now it's known he was a top Nazi, and Arnold says, I don't care, I love him.
[02:08:49.589 --> 02:08:51.951]  And the Jewish groups go, Hey, old Arnold!
[02:08:52.291 --> 02:08:54.412]  Don't talk about him, you anti-Semite!
[02:08:54.432 --> 02:08:56.594]  I mean, it's sick, man.
[02:08:56.654 --> 02:08:58.055]  It's just sick.
[02:08:58.515 --> 02:08:59.376]  Oh, I know, I know.
[02:08:59.396 --> 02:09:01.177]  And it's the old corporate
[02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:12.713]  The corporate state model is that the citizens have no self-preservation aspect to themselves.
[02:09:12.913 --> 02:09:15.193]  That their only duty is to the state.
[02:09:16.734 --> 02:09:20.695]  To fight for your own self-preservation is to oppose the state.
[02:09:22.416 --> 02:09:27.537]  That's very clear in Rocco and Mussolini's treatise on fascism.
[02:09:28.037 --> 02:09:29.578]  This whole idea of
[02:09:30.106 --> 02:09:42.858]  Demanding that we give up our, you know, you're just talking about the National ID Card, that we become experimental models for the new types of pharmaceuticals they're dumping on the market.
[02:09:43.534 --> 02:09:49.555]  Uh, virtually untested, yet we're going to be the models for the experimental guinea pigs for them.
[02:09:49.975 --> 02:09:52.916]  Hey, you know, it's too bad I missed Ellen Mariani.
[02:09:53.056 --> 02:09:57.116]  I would have wanted to ask her about the put options if she had any new information.
[02:09:57.236 --> 02:09:59.497]  Well, that's where we can really catch them when they're pants down.
[02:09:59.557 --> 02:10:11.219]  Buzzy Kromgaard comes out last week and says, this is the headline, folks, I'm not worried about Bin Laden, we shouldn't capture him, and this is the guy with the put options, billions, leading back to him.
[02:10:11.969 --> 02:10:15.031]  Right, and did I hear that he resigned?
[02:10:15.131 --> 02:10:17.692]  One of the shows was talking about his resignation.
[02:10:17.792 --> 02:10:20.894]  Yes, they're now saying he's resigning after three years at CIA.
[02:10:21.314 --> 02:10:27.498]  Okay, but we don't... He's a very difficult person to find information on, and I'm just wondering if you've got any...
[02:10:33.479 --> 02:10:34.440]  Well, not in front of me.
[02:10:34.480 --> 02:10:37.641]  I mean, there's so many of these characters, but great call, David.
[02:10:37.661 --> 02:10:38.921]  That's the kind of caller I like.
[02:10:38.961 --> 02:10:39.542]  I just love it.
[02:10:39.582 --> 02:10:40.482]  Full of information.
[02:10:41.082 --> 02:10:41.703]  Man, I love it.
[02:10:42.063 --> 02:10:43.403]  Lane in Kansas City.
[02:10:43.423 --> 02:10:44.084]  You're on the air.
[02:10:44.144 --> 02:10:44.604]  Go ahead.
[02:10:45.644 --> 02:10:46.204]  Hello, Alex.
[02:10:46.605 --> 02:10:46.785]  Yes.
[02:10:46.825 --> 02:10:48.685]  Love your show when I can get it.
[02:10:48.705 --> 02:10:51.687]  Wanted to know if you could give me some direction.
[02:10:51.727 --> 02:10:57.149]  I'm looking for information on the convenience stores and hotels that are
[02:10:58.078 --> 02:11:01.840]  At least in this area, predominantly owned by Arabs and Indians.
[02:11:03.460 --> 02:11:09.543]  Well, I have nothing against, you know, white people, Indians, whoever owning stuff, but I have to tell you.
[02:11:10.143 --> 02:11:11.404]  No, you're lying.
[02:11:11.444 --> 02:11:12.744]  Listen, I'm going to say something.
[02:11:15.065 --> 02:11:21.488]  It has become a racket, and the way they compete is not free market, and it's a problem.
[02:11:21.608 --> 02:11:26.850]  I've been on trips for 4,000 miles around the country where there is one motel
[02:11:27.825 --> 02:11:29.446]  Where it isn't owned by Indians.
[02:11:30.366 --> 02:11:54.815]  And how they do this is, is basically slave labor in India, they take that money, there's a couple big families that own it, then they put their people in here, basically who work for nothing, then they get a ten year tax exemption, which nobody else can compete against, and so they're buying up everything, and folks, I've gone north, south, east, and west, and you'll see a black person, or a hispanic, or a white guy behind the counter, and I'll go, this isn't owned by Indians?
[02:11:55.055 --> 02:11:55.895]  Well, yes it is.
[02:11:56.647 --> 02:11:58.849]  And I'll say the name of the family and they'll go, yes it is.
[02:11:59.450 --> 02:12:05.455]  I mean, it is, folks, when everything is owned by one or two or three families, you've got a problem.
[02:12:06.135 --> 02:12:09.879]  But where, what is the source of the exemption that they get?
[02:12:10.699 --> 02:12:15.784]  Oh, there's several different pieces of legislation, seven to ten years of tax exemption for immigrants.
[02:12:15.804 --> 02:12:16.504]  That's why I understood.
[02:12:17.045 --> 02:12:23.631]  And so that's why these groups are able to buy everything up, because it's not fair.
[02:12:24.218 --> 02:12:25.899]  So is it part of the immigration law?
[02:12:26.219 --> 02:12:26.499]  Yes.
[02:12:27.799 --> 02:12:28.500]  Oh, okay.
[02:12:28.520 --> 02:12:28.920]  Very good.
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:31.100]  Like I said, I love your show and I can get it.
[02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:31.721]  Thank you very much.
[02:12:32.021 --> 02:12:32.841]  Thank you for the call.
[02:12:32.921 --> 02:12:34.182]  I appreciate the call.
[02:12:35.182 --> 02:12:40.684]  Let's talk to Michael in... Where's this next caller from?
[02:12:41.904 --> 02:12:42.424]  Colorado.
[02:12:42.484 --> 02:12:43.125]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:12:43.485 --> 02:12:44.865]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:12:45.045 --> 02:12:45.445]  You bet.
[02:12:45.526 --> 02:12:47.666]  I wanted to talk about the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[02:12:47.906 --> 02:12:52.408]  I want to urge all your listeners out there who have all this valuable information
[02:12:52.987 --> 02:12:54.728]  Get off the bench and get in the game.
[02:12:54.748 --> 02:12:58.551]  We need to get this issue of 9-11 out to the public.
[02:12:58.711 --> 02:13:03.113]  Every listener that has a computer should build their own 9-11 website.
[02:13:03.133 --> 02:13:06.275]  There's so much evidence, no one can put it all in one place.
[02:13:06.556 --> 02:13:08.157]  There's 10 new things a day.
[02:13:08.737 --> 02:13:11.119]  We have to take the web over.
[02:13:11.159 --> 02:13:12.860]  We've already done it to a certain extent.
[02:13:13.040 --> 02:13:14.100]  Let's turn the heat up.
[02:13:14.301 --> 02:13:15.902]  We're doing everything that you suggest.
[02:13:15.922 --> 02:13:19.584]  You have a lot of loyal listeners here in Colorado, Alex.
[02:13:20.331 --> 02:13:21.812]  And we've done exactly that.
[02:13:21.852 --> 02:13:29.474]  We've got a website up, and we're having 9-11 town meetings all around the state, and we're getting noticed, Alex.
[02:13:30.535 --> 02:13:36.097]  We had two cover stories, one on the Boulder Weekly, and one on the Rocky Mountain Bullhorn.
[02:13:36.677 --> 02:13:39.618]  And I have those posted on our website at colorado.org.
[02:13:40.783 --> 02:13:42.603]  9-1-1-Visibility.org.
[02:13:42.743 --> 02:13:43.464]  I love it!
[02:13:43.864 --> 02:13:45.884]  Do that website out again!
[02:13:46.084 --> 02:13:49.445]  We started having these town meetings, Alex, and we got noticed.
[02:13:49.465 --> 02:13:52.185]  We were having an impact, and we got noticed.
[02:13:52.645 --> 02:13:56.206]  We were approached by these two papers who did a cover story on us.
[02:13:56.686 --> 02:13:58.786]  A very good story.
[02:13:59.106 --> 02:14:00.787]  Listen, that's what it takes.
[02:14:00.847 --> 02:14:03.587]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:14:03.667 --> 02:14:04.267]  Exactly.
[02:14:04.287 --> 02:14:07.748]  I just want to encourage you people out there to get involved.
[02:14:07.788 --> 02:14:08.828]  If I can do this,
[02:14:09.284 --> 02:14:10.045]  You can do this.
[02:14:10.545 --> 02:14:18.092]  I'm an ordinary guy and, you know, we got to get at the bottom of 9-11 and, you know, we're having these meetings across the state.
[02:14:18.833 --> 02:14:21.295]  I want to add something to what Ellen had said.
[02:14:22.036 --> 02:14:24.858]  Ellen has been coming to some of our meetings and speaking.
[02:14:25.218 --> 02:14:26.740]  Yeah, she's in Colorado right now.
[02:14:26.880 --> 02:14:31.884]  Yes, and she's actually going to be speaking at our next meeting, which is going to be next Tuesday.
[02:14:32.365 --> 02:14:34.187]  But she's going around the country doing this.
[02:14:35.177 --> 02:14:38.299]  And she didn't mention that today, so I wanted to bring that up.
[02:14:38.919 --> 02:14:41.801]  Any 9-11 group out there who would like that.
[02:14:41.961 --> 02:14:44.462]  Tell folks about where the meeting is going to be next Tuesday.
[02:14:44.842 --> 02:14:48.304]  It's going to be in Fort Collins, Colorado at the Harmony Library.
[02:14:48.745 --> 02:14:49.745]  It's at 7 o'clock.
[02:14:49.825 --> 02:14:53.367]  It's the 9-11 town meeting, What You Don't Know About September 11th.
[02:14:53.407 --> 02:14:54.428]  Okay, great call.
[02:14:54.488 --> 02:14:55.088]  Keep it up.
[02:14:55.588 --> 02:14:56.029]  Excellent.
[02:14:56.049 --> 02:14:58.730]  We need more leaders to take action like you're doing.
[02:14:59.170 --> 02:15:00.651]  God bless you.
[02:15:01.211 --> 02:15:03.313]  Alright, let's talk to Manuel in Pennsylvania.
[02:15:03.353 --> 02:15:03.853]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:15:04.585 --> 02:15:05.366]  Okay, how you doing?
[02:15:05.546 --> 02:15:05.766]  Good!
[02:15:06.026 --> 02:15:07.207]  And big up to Mike in Colorado.
[02:15:07.227 --> 02:15:08.028]  That's what I like to hear.
[02:15:08.128 --> 02:15:09.048]  That's what I like to see.
[02:15:09.609 --> 02:15:12.311]  I saw an interesting discussion on C-SPAN yesterday.
[02:15:13.151 --> 02:15:18.756]  And the topic of discussion during the forum with Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer was international law.
[02:15:19.076 --> 02:15:20.817]  And the U.S.
[02:15:20.857 --> 02:15:23.339]  increasingly citing it when handing down Supreme Court cases.
[02:15:23.837 --> 02:15:28.259]  Justice Scalia fought against it, and Justice Breyer largely for it.
[02:15:28.499 --> 02:15:48.648]  And what you've got is seven of nine appointed by Republicans, and so they'll have these little fake left-right fights between each other, but this is a Republican court predominantly doing this, and in the last three years, we've had the majority of the courts say, we follow UN and World Court rulings, but then they want to act like they're against the UN and the World Court,
[02:15:49.725 --> 02:15:56.328]  On other key issues, then the UN comes out and speaks out against torture, when they've engaged in more torture than this government ever has.
[02:15:56.768 --> 02:16:05.552]  So what they do is by blaming the other side, when it's all two arms on the same ogre, it gives us an illusion of some type of separation.
[02:16:05.832 --> 02:16:07.212]  But really it's the same system.
[02:16:07.612 --> 02:16:10.033]  Yeah, people, heed caution and listen up, because you're right on point.
[02:16:10.294 --> 02:16:15.256]  And see, the thing is, they introduce it in a forum like C-SPAN, now more and more people are going to start discussing it.
[02:16:15.276 --> 02:16:18.637]  I think it's going to filter down into the cable news networks, and you're going to see the propaganda head.
[02:16:19.275 --> 02:16:32.747]  They've had cover stories in USA Today telling us how it's good that we follow international treaties and international court rulings.
[02:16:32.847 --> 02:16:42.275]  The organization here that for the past 30 years has been overseeing our public access channel has literally been infiltrated by the government heads and we're going to court on this one massive
[02:16:42.881 --> 02:16:44.802]  Voting fraud right on the floor.
[02:16:45.082 --> 02:16:46.663]  We voted to dissolve the organization.
[02:16:46.683 --> 02:16:49.585]  We were voting against dissolving and handing it over to the government.
[02:16:49.985 --> 02:16:50.486]  Incredible.
[02:16:51.166 --> 02:16:52.907]  The power grab is going on everywhere.
[02:16:52.987 --> 02:16:55.328]  They're shutting AXS TV down all over the place.
[02:16:55.368 --> 02:16:57.029]  I had to sue people locally.
[02:16:57.490 --> 02:16:59.311]  Now there's huge fraud investigations.
[02:16:59.351 --> 02:17:02.893]  We exposed that all over the newspapers and TV here in Austin.
[02:17:04.514 --> 02:17:05.634]  Can't stop the movement though.
[02:17:05.875 --> 02:17:06.675]  Can't stop the movement.
[02:17:06.695 --> 02:17:07.496]  We'll take it somewhere else.
[02:17:07.856 --> 02:17:09.437]  Can't stop the run, can they?
[02:17:09.937 --> 02:17:10.697]  Nope, not at all.
[02:17:10.958 --> 02:17:11.378]  Keep it going.
[02:17:12.449 --> 02:17:13.549]  All right, good to hear from you.
[02:17:14.430 --> 02:17:20.251]  And Globalist, when you nuke a city, God forbid you do, but we know you probably will, just more people are going to know you did it.
[02:17:20.391 --> 02:17:22.012]  Day one will know you did it.
[02:17:22.312 --> 02:17:25.192]  Day one will be on the ground exposing you.
[02:17:25.893 --> 02:17:30.174]  And we're waking up your police, we're waking up your military, we're waking up people in the government.
[02:17:30.534 --> 02:17:31.494]  We're winning.
[02:17:31.554 --> 02:17:32.454]  Do you understand?
[02:17:32.494 --> 02:17:35.435]  You can't co-opt us, you can't control us, you can't
[02:17:35.555 --> 02:17:36.456]  Kill all of us.
[02:17:36.816 --> 02:17:38.677]  You are going to fail, Globalist.
[02:17:39.057 --> 02:17:41.178]  You went too far, too fast.
[02:17:41.439 --> 02:17:43.540]  Your system is falling apart.
[02:17:45.717 --> 02:17:48.239]  Hey gang, it's time for a fresh, healthy start.
[02:17:48.399 --> 02:17:51.842]  Take charge and lose that unwanted fat with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate.

[02:18:42.068 --> 02:18:42.969]  Easy way to remember it?
[02:18:42.989 --> 02:18:44.890]  1-800-622-FIN.
[02:18:45.271 --> 02:18:51.496]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:18:51.936 --> 02:18:59.722]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:19:00.063 --> 02:19:07.909]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit, we call the Federal Reserve Note, forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:19:08.209 --> 02:19:12.973]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:19:13.313 --> 02:19:17.997]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.

[02:22:13.702 --> 02:22:18.145]  To keep them alive so the freedom can be given to them.
[02:22:19.471 --> 02:22:21.133]  Joseph Mingala was good at that too.
[02:22:21.153 --> 02:22:22.194]  Maybe he wasn't bad.
[02:22:23.054 --> 02:22:26.137]  Let's go ahead, of course, I think he was, because maybe I'm evil.
[02:22:27.057 --> 02:22:30.160]  Maybe Mingala was good and people that are against him are bad.
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:34.663]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:22:34.683 --> 02:22:38.826]  Let's talk to Eric in Oklahoma, then Ed, Chris, Joe, Steve and others.
[02:22:38.866 --> 02:22:39.427]  Go ahead, Eric.
[02:22:39.647 --> 02:22:40.308]  Hey, Alex.
[02:22:40.948 --> 02:22:42.649]  Michael Chertoff, the son of the devil.
[02:22:44.056 --> 02:22:44.477]  I think?
[02:22:54.642 --> 02:22:59.044]  So Tom Ridge was really a figurehead, but Chertoff... That's right!
[02:22:59.164 --> 02:23:08.746]  Chertoff, and again to show my ignorance, I knew he was Patriot Act, helped to write it with the Gonzales, I knew he was really bad, helped cover up 9-11, but he's another foreigner!
[02:23:09.167 --> 02:23:09.927]  Yeah.
[02:23:10.027 --> 02:23:20.590]  And it's like John Shelley Cachevilli's dad ran death camps, taught general in Poland for the Nazis, it's admitted he was a traitor who helped hunt down his own people,
[02:23:21.370 --> 02:23:27.414]  And, I mean, it's almost... Madeline Albright's dad was a Czechoslovakian leader who purged millions!
[02:23:28.635 --> 02:23:29.376]  It's sick!
[02:23:29.696 --> 02:23:33.218]  You ran your genealogy down and you found your name at Son of the Devil.
[02:23:35.059 --> 02:23:35.900]  Well, you know, that's true.
[02:23:35.960 --> 02:23:40.223]  His name does mean, actually, Seed of Satan.
[02:23:40.543 --> 02:23:40.983]  Indeed.
[02:23:41.224 --> 02:23:41.604]  Yes, sir.
[02:23:43.936 --> 02:23:45.958]  Man, it is getting so surreal now.
[02:23:47.079 --> 02:23:51.242]  So they have all these Eastern Black guys that are going to be setting policy for Homeland Security.
[02:23:51.522 --> 02:23:53.143]  I really just want your analysis on this.
[02:23:53.203 --> 02:23:55.325]  What do you think is going to happen after Ridgeley's?
[02:23:56.366 --> 02:24:00.289]  I believe these guys are going to consolidate more of the East German
[02:24:01.563 --> 02:24:04.605]  And KGB Flavor is going to come into the Homeland Security Department.
[02:24:04.645 --> 02:24:05.106]  What do you think?
[02:24:05.266 --> 02:24:06.227]  Well, no, that's it.
[02:24:06.247 --> 02:24:08.408]  They've been consulting because they know how to do it.
[02:24:08.489 --> 02:24:10.150]  I mean, this is documented.
[02:24:10.690 --> 02:24:25.303]  They have consulted and paid and hired hundreds of high-level, GRU, KGB, external, internal, STASI experts, now the former head of the STASI, the Silver Fox, to do this in America.
[02:24:25.403 --> 02:24:26.084]  And they're doing it.
[02:24:26.124 --> 02:24:26.444]  The T.I.P.S.
[02:24:26.484 --> 02:24:27.485]  programs, all of it.
[02:24:28.706 --> 02:24:29.046]  Yeah.
[02:24:29.226 --> 02:24:32.329]  Hey, Alex, it's going to be an interesting next four years.
[02:24:32.389 --> 02:24:32.789]  I know that.
[02:24:33.870 --> 02:24:35.291]  Well, it's going to be freedom, sir.
[02:24:35.552 --> 02:24:37.713]  Hey, brother, you're doing great.
[02:24:37.793 --> 02:24:38.294]  I love you.
[02:24:38.914 --> 02:24:39.835]  Take care, my friend.
[02:24:40.395 --> 02:24:42.197]  Let's talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[02:24:42.337 --> 02:24:43.098]  Ed, go ahead.
[02:24:43.638 --> 02:24:51.364]  Alex, yesterday you had Colonel Craig Roberts on, and he says he's working hard to get the armored personnel carriers over there in Iraq.
[02:24:52.305 --> 02:24:57.309]  And the September 4th issue of Soldier of Fortune, a six-page article,
[02:24:58.107 --> 02:25:02.871]  Dan, we have 13,000 of them in our arsenal, in our fleet.
[02:25:03.131 --> 02:25:06.054]  Yeah, no, but you can't, look, those are for domestic use.
[02:25:06.374 --> 02:25:13.941]  They bought thousands more from a GM factory that they ordered them three years ago, and those are being delivered all over the country.
[02:25:13.981 --> 02:25:19.325]  Listen, I've got video that I'm not allowed to show at this time, because people that have it have to edit out the faces.
[02:25:19.525 --> 02:25:22.068]  It's not classified, but they're afraid
[02:25:23.289 --> 02:25:39.081]  But it's up by Dallas, and it's a Homeland Security base, and there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of old Bell helicopters having the new engines put in them, and they're going to paint them black the whole nine yards.
[02:25:39.361 --> 02:25:41.022]  I mean, what is all this for?
[02:25:41.763 --> 02:25:44.345]  This isn't for 10 or 15 terrorists here or there, folks.
[02:25:44.765 --> 02:25:50.730]  The government has some very nice things planned for the American people, but one of these guys I know brought this up to the TV station
[02:25:52.268 --> 02:26:01.173]  What was it, Wednesday night, and he wouldn't let me have it, but he's a pilot himself, and I'm not going to go any further into that, but it's not even secret.
[02:26:01.213 --> 02:26:09.277]  You can go up there and do it, but he wants to cut his brother out of the video before he gives it to me, which I guess is good, that way I won't play it with his brother, but I wouldn't do that anyways.
[02:26:09.957 --> 02:26:12.858]  But I mean, it's really a miner's footnote in all of this.
[02:26:13.519 --> 02:26:16.020]  I mean, they're geared up to deal with the American people.
[02:26:17.739 --> 02:26:18.560]  Exactly.
[02:26:18.680 --> 02:26:21.261]  When something happens, the American people are going to lose their minds.
[02:26:21.281 --> 02:26:23.082]  They're going to be running around like crazy.
[02:26:24.123 --> 02:26:26.564]  And we'll have control over them.
[02:26:26.764 --> 02:26:28.325]  The government will put control over the people.
[02:26:28.445 --> 02:26:30.706]  Well, fleets of helicopters will keep you safe, sir.
[02:26:31.507 --> 02:26:34.948]  Condition Red, they have the right to shoot.
[02:26:35.269 --> 02:26:38.030]  They don't have the right, but they will shoot the American public.
[02:26:38.450 --> 02:26:39.231]  They will kill the American public.
[02:26:39.251 --> 02:26:44.874]  Well, they've said in the Washington Post, and Gannett News Service, and AP, and everywhere else, that under Condition Red, you have no rights
[02:26:45.606 --> 02:26:48.107]  And it may be permanent, and it will be total slavery.
[02:26:49.687 --> 02:26:56.488]  And then you're not going to complain too much when they take your pension funds, and when they jack up your taxes, and when they take your children for the draft.
[02:26:56.868 --> 02:26:58.169]  That's what tyranny is all about.
[02:26:58.349 --> 02:27:10.391]  They have to capture us as their slaves, to use us then as their captive slaves, like German Hessians who were owned by their lords, to be marched off to take over, quote, the gap that is all these third world countries.
[02:27:11.704 --> 02:27:12.185]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:27:12.645 --> 02:27:13.886]  That's what it's all about, thank you.
[02:27:14.287 --> 02:27:15.448]  That's why they want tyranny.
[02:27:16.029 --> 02:27:24.818]  So they can take what you've got, make you their good little slave, teach you how to worship them properly, and then forge us into their fist.
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:27.761]  It's a wonderful system.
[02:27:29.343 --> 02:27:31.205]  Oh, the force of drugging all of it.
[02:27:32.406 --> 02:27:33.528]  Oh, it's so good.
[02:27:35.922 --> 02:27:38.963]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.983 --> 02:27:42.624]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.804 --> 02:27:49.525]  You've heard about POS from Biolox International and its bubble-up technology.
[02:27:49.785 --> 02:27:54.066]  But have you heard about Biooxytous Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[02:27:54.306 --> 02:28:01.248]  Biooxytous Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:28:01.648 --> 02:28:08.338]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[02:28:08.599 --> 02:28:12.064]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWox, such as concentrate.
[02:28:12.224 --> 02:28:12.865]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit biowox.com.
[02:28:17.171 --> 02:28:24.318]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[02:28:24.398 --> 02:28:31.084]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[02:28:31.304 --> 02:28:35.968]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[02:28:36.168 --> 02:28:38.691]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[02:28:38.851 --> 02:28:43.515]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use Bio-Ox family of products.
[02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:47.341]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.481 --> 02:28:51.583]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.723 --> 02:28:54.604]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.684 --> 02:29:01.408]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.588 --> 02:29:04.589]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:04.789 --> 02:29:07.191]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.311 --> 02:29:12.033]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:12.213 --> 02:29:26.796]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:26.936 --> 02:29:33.577]  Supercharge your gravity filter today, and order a 2-pack of Black Murky Purification Elements for only $96, or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at
[02:29:36.578 --> 02:29:36.958]  803-4438.

[02:29:37.479 --> 02:29:39.701]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:29:47.449 --> 02:29:52.931]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.351 --> 02:29:57.592]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:57.812 --> 02:30:04.854]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.234 --> 02:30:11.336]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.476 --> 02:30:12.696]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.036 --> 02:30:16.000]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:18.162]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:18.483 --> 02:30:25.731]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:26.012 --> 02:30:29.396]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:30:33.299 --> 02:30:34.520]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[02:30:34.580 --> 02:30:36.041]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:36.061 --> 02:30:37.662]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:37.702 --> 02:30:38.602]  I love America!
[02:31:00.254 --> 02:31:04.795]  I can't stand watching these criminals dismantle it and watch so many people foolishly laugh about it.
[02:31:05.076 --> 02:31:06.956]  Oh, the government's my friend!
[02:31:07.316 --> 02:31:12.838]  They run PR announcements, public service adverts telling me how much they love me.
[02:31:12.858 --> 02:31:14.698]  I can trust them.
[02:31:15.819 --> 02:31:22.681]  The caller earlier was talking about the Duke of Edinburgh, the Nazi, who was in Nazi Germany as it was being bombed and had to flee out through Spain.
[02:31:24.184 --> 02:31:28.245]  And that was really kept quiet, but they've got the photos and film of him worshipping.
[02:31:28.285 --> 02:31:31.026]  I mean, literally bending over, bowing to Hitler.
[02:31:31.286 --> 02:31:33.267]  Oh, your leadership!
[02:31:33.287 --> 02:31:33.327]  Oh!
[02:31:34.327 --> 02:31:34.367]  Oh!
[02:31:35.327 --> 02:31:38.288]  And his American wife, who was another Nazi.
[02:31:39.809 --> 02:31:42.850]  And now Harry, by the way, the Duke of Edinburgh was going to be king.
[02:31:43.910 --> 02:31:47.471]  Now Harry is running around in Nazi outfits.
[02:31:49.133 --> 02:31:52.135]  Why does this, and then British Earl says, look, leave him alone.
[02:31:52.955 --> 02:31:57.278]  His aunt says, hey, die would be proud of him.
[02:31:57.298 --> 02:31:59.959]  These people are scum, folks.
[02:32:00.680 --> 02:32:01.420]  They're scum.
[02:32:01.861 --> 02:32:03.201]  They're total scum.
[02:32:06.043 --> 02:32:10.426]  But, because they're the elite, they're allowed to have their Nazi sympathies.
[02:32:10.766 --> 02:32:12.187]  Just like Schwarzenegger is.
[02:32:13.327 --> 02:32:14.288]  It's just that simple.
[02:32:14.915 --> 02:32:21.620]  He's allowed to play Nazi music and hand out Nazi records and say he wants to be a dictator and say he wants to rule the people in U.S.
[02:32:21.640 --> 02:32:24.842]  News and World Report just in 1990 alone, when he was 44.
[02:32:25.243 --> 02:32:31.347]  He's allowed to say, I don't care if Kirk's a Nazi in the middle of a Nazi scandal and then go vacation for him and campaign for him.
[02:32:32.348 --> 02:32:34.609]  He'll get all the ADL awards, folks.
[02:32:34.669 --> 02:32:35.750]  You've got to ask yourselves why.
[02:32:38.132 --> 02:32:39.673]  It's very, very disgusting.
[02:32:41.218 --> 02:32:44.159]  But, uh, I was just thinking about the royals during the break.
[02:32:44.459 --> 02:33:01.924]  The House of Windsor, the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas, the Saxes married the Coburgs, married the Gothas, and how I've been on British radio probably 25 times the last few years, and I'll ask the listeners, do you know the name of your royal family?
[02:33:01.984 --> 02:33:03.365]  Why it's just Queen Elizabeth?
[02:33:03.405 --> 02:33:03.705]  Why it's
[02:33:04.548 --> 02:33:05.709]  Why it's just Prince Philip?
[02:33:05.789 --> 02:33:07.991]  Why it's just Prince Charles?
[02:33:08.111 --> 02:33:09.412]  No, I don't know their name!
[02:33:09.612 --> 02:33:11.754]  Well, why don't you even know their last name?
[02:33:11.934 --> 02:33:13.936]  See, that's the power of the globalists.
[02:33:15.637 --> 02:33:21.942]  They've got such a propaganda system that you don't even know your rulers' names!
[02:33:24.644 --> 02:33:31.890]  Well, they want to keep their names secret because it'd be like... It'd be like, I guess, in Israel if their leader was, uh...
[02:33:33.743 --> 02:33:40.626]  I don't know, a South African and one's Jewish, or... I mean, it's just... it's ridiculous!
[02:33:41.407 --> 02:33:42.847]  It's ridiculous!
[02:33:43.708 --> 02:33:45.168]  And I'm tired of it!
[02:33:46.429 --> 02:34:02.997]  And these groups, man, they've got a really sophisticated system where they fund all the so-called groups that fight anti-Semitism to go take people's free speech, and on the other end, there are actually Nazis involved in eugenics programs and sterilization programs, and... It's just amazing!
[02:34:03.522 --> 02:34:18.286]  But again, if you were a Nazi, again, who funded the Nazis like his father did, Lord Rothschild's father, Lord Rothschild, Jacob Rothschild, then, you see, you'd prance around saying you were Jewish.
[02:34:20.706 --> 02:34:23.387]  But again, it's a little too sophisticated for people sometimes.
[02:34:24.467 --> 02:34:25.828]  I'm just thinking about this.
[02:34:26.048 --> 02:34:27.808]  It makes me angry.
[02:34:29.729 --> 02:34:30.929]  It makes me very, very
[02:34:32.068 --> 02:34:33.028]  Just frustrated.
[02:34:33.549 --> 02:34:35.229]  It makes my brain burn.
[02:34:36.930 --> 02:34:38.291]  That again, the British people.
[02:34:39.371 --> 02:34:43.974]  By the way, you know that the Royal Family owns a bunch of the tabloids that actually write mean articles about themselves?
[02:34:45.354 --> 02:34:55.639]  They actually put out propaganda about how they don't have any power, and they're a joke, and they're ha ha ha, and they're actually making money with the TV production companies and newspapers that put the stuff out.
[02:34:57.274 --> 02:34:59.415]  That's how sophisticated these people are.
[02:34:59.695 --> 02:35:00.635]  Because that's their job.
[02:35:00.675 --> 02:35:02.995]  Their business is how to control populations.
[02:35:03.195 --> 02:35:04.436]  It's how to hide their power.
[02:35:06.216 --> 02:35:08.597]  It'd be like, oh, yes, Lord Bush.
[02:35:08.617 --> 02:35:09.837]  And you go, what's his last name?
[02:35:09.937 --> 02:35:10.377]  I don't know.
[02:35:10.837 --> 02:35:11.457]  Why are you asking?
[02:35:11.477 --> 02:35:15.358]  Well, don't you want to know the president, the leader, the fuhrer's last name?
[02:35:15.378 --> 02:35:17.359]  I never thought about that.
[02:35:17.519 --> 02:35:20.939]  I never really... I mean, that's control.
[02:35:21.339 --> 02:35:23.540]  Folks, they still have manuals put out where
[02:35:24.597 --> 02:35:26.559]  They say the Rothschilds don't exist.
[02:35:27.039 --> 02:35:36.106]  There's government, anti-government manuals where it goes, these groups secretly believe, you know, they believe there's a group called the Rothschilds that run things.
[02:35:36.167 --> 02:35:37.828]  They believe there's a new world order.
[02:35:37.948 --> 02:35:40.290]  And we just got presidents calling for it.
[02:35:41.391 --> 02:35:43.513]  They deny the sun comes up in the morning.
[02:35:43.553 --> 02:35:47.616]  Let's just, just go through your calls at a high rate of speed now.
[02:35:48.537 --> 02:35:51.219]  Control my ranting for a moment and do that.
[02:35:53.072 --> 02:35:57.154]  Up next here I guess would be, would it be Chris?
[02:35:58.115 --> 02:35:59.816]  Chris in Kentucky, go ahead Chris.
[02:36:00.176 --> 02:36:02.958]  Hey Alex, I'm just outraged with everything out here.
[02:36:02.998 --> 02:36:07.800]  I mean, Sean Hannity says, you know, there are a bunch of shoot-em-like animals in Iraq no matter what they are.
[02:36:08.561 --> 02:36:12.343]  And then I had a local station here, I had a guy that was making so much money
[02:36:13.092 --> 02:36:18.937]  His job went overseas, they homeschooled the kids, now he's got to take a state job with his kid in public schools.
[02:36:19.117 --> 02:36:21.740]  I mean, this is the conditioning of what they're doing to these people out here.
[02:36:21.760 --> 02:36:23.822]  They're taking everything they can away from us.
[02:36:24.022 --> 02:36:25.984]  They tell women, hey, don't you want to work?
[02:36:26.204 --> 02:36:30.888]  Break up the family, cut your pay in half, and then now your kids belong to the state.
[02:36:31.228 --> 02:36:34.811]  Feminism, run by the CIA, Gloria Steinem admits it, Ms.
[02:36:34.852 --> 02:36:35.892]  Magazine started by the CIA.
[02:36:37.333 --> 02:36:42.198]  I'm not against women working, but the point is, the system's been set up now where you have to!
[02:36:42.738 --> 02:36:49.966]  That's what's happening, and I work part-time at a public school, and you're seeing it with the private school kids coming in from the public schools.
[02:36:50.387 --> 02:36:55.332]  And two kids I met the other day had the anti-potty codis law, the drug war t-shirt on.
[02:36:55.891 --> 02:37:00.732]  I told them all about the drug wars, and your show, Alex Jones, Infowars.com.
[02:37:01.052 --> 02:37:05.514]  I told them about the police state... Don't use drugs if they're not cool, children!
[02:37:06.654 --> 02:37:12.736]  It's sold to you as cool by the controlled counterculture, it's rat poison, put out for you by the globalists!
[02:37:13.016 --> 02:37:17.997]  Exactly, and that's... wherever you got that thing, this is good, and this is good, more police state's good for it.
[02:37:18.490 --> 02:37:23.872]  I told him, and one of the kids came up to me after a while and got the information and said, you're right.
[02:37:24.032 --> 02:37:28.873]  I did check out some information about the drug war with the CIA and he wants to talk to me more about it.
[02:37:28.913 --> 02:37:30.213]  I'm going to ask you to wake this up.
[02:37:30.593 --> 02:37:30.853]  Good.
[02:37:30.973 --> 02:37:31.814]  Take care, my friend.
[02:37:32.574 --> 02:37:36.395]  Our counter-information is millions of times more powerful.
[02:37:36.435 --> 02:37:37.315]  I mean that when I say it.
[02:37:37.595 --> 02:37:42.257]  The globalists have to reapply lies, reapply lies, reapply lies over and over again.
[02:37:42.317 --> 02:37:45.077]  We've got to teach people how to fish.
[02:37:46.418 --> 02:37:47.138]  That's the analogy.
[02:37:48.030 --> 02:37:55.676]  Or the example, it's analogous to it, is that the globalists have to feed you fish, poison fish, we teach you how to fish.
[02:37:56.336 --> 02:37:57.437]  That's how we're going to win.
[02:37:58.738 --> 02:38:00.580]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:38:00.780 --> 02:38:02.281]  Joe in Ohio, go ahead.
[02:38:02.301 --> 02:38:03.822]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:38:03.962 --> 02:38:04.222]  Good.
[02:38:04.783 --> 02:38:09.266]  I'd like to commend that teacher that I just called in for actually putting some real information in these public schools.
[02:38:10.467 --> 02:38:16.632]  And I'd also like to comment on, well, briefly, you had mentioned the tabloid inserts by the Windsor family and all the controlled media in England.
[02:38:17.645 --> 02:38:25.707]  And when I see this hairy Nazi charade going on all day long on CNN, I can't help but think it's just a cover-up for the bomb they dropped the other day about Thatcher.
[02:38:25.727 --> 02:38:30.969]  Yeah, they're really good with cover... big distractions, yes.
[02:38:30.989 --> 02:38:47.013]  I'd also like to mention, you've been speaking about the National Social Security cards about the issue, and I was watching Lou Dobbs last night, and Senator Dreyer from Cali was on Lou Dobbs, and actually had the new standardized, I guess universal Social Security card.
[02:38:48.266 --> 02:38:55.172]  And what really cracked me up was on the bottom of the card, it actually says, this is not a national ID card.
[02:38:55.412 --> 02:38:56.253]  Ha ha ha!
[02:38:56.553 --> 02:38:58.174]  The bill says internal, look.
[02:38:59.095 --> 02:39:00.857]  So I don't, and he did mention that.
[02:39:00.917 --> 02:39:02.098]  Let's break this down.
[02:39:02.258 --> 02:39:03.079]  Let's break this down.
[02:39:03.819 --> 02:39:10.545]  Until about, what, ten years ago, all social security cards said not to be used as a personal identification card by law.
[02:39:11.269 --> 02:39:13.891]  Well, I mean, they wrote that on the plans a while back.
[02:39:13.911 --> 02:39:14.191]  Nothing new.
[02:39:14.211 --> 02:39:16.612]  I mean, people just need to figure this out, I guess.
[02:39:37.867 --> 02:39:39.327]  They don't believe me.
[02:39:40.688 --> 02:39:41.068]  Oh, I know.
[02:39:41.088 --> 02:39:42.648]  They passed the National ID card.
[02:39:42.668 --> 02:39:46.449]  They're face scanning and thumb scanning to get a driver's license now in 48 states.
[02:39:46.489 --> 02:39:48.210]  The last two by law are about to do it.
[02:39:48.490 --> 02:39:49.650]  And they're saying it doesn't exist.
[02:39:50.251 --> 02:39:55.632]  Yeah, and the driver admitted that he'll need this new standardized Social Security card to get a new job, to apply for a new job.
[02:39:56.652 --> 02:39:58.513]  And he even mentioned the illegals don't need it.
[02:39:59.659 --> 02:40:04.103]  Oh yeah, there was a waiver in there, an actual amnesty clause, where the illegals don't have to have it.
[02:40:05.404 --> 02:40:06.184]  Thanks for the call!
[02:40:06.424 --> 02:40:07.205]  I appreciate it!
[02:40:07.525 --> 02:40:08.366]  Oh, I really do.
[02:40:08.766 --> 02:40:23.378]  Yes, it's not a national ID card, you just have to have it to have a job, and we're getting ready to make you use it to buy and sell, but it's okay, because the so-called Christian news channels tell you it's good, it'll keep us safe from Al-Qaeda, but the illegals are exempt.
[02:40:24.178 --> 02:40:25.679]  Let's talk to Steve in Ohio.
[02:40:25.739 --> 02:40:26.460]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:40:26.760 --> 02:40:27.661]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[02:40:28.274 --> 02:40:28.694]  Pretty good.
[02:40:29.034 --> 02:40:30.075]  Just a real quick question.
[02:40:30.435 --> 02:40:33.976]  It's obvious that the Democrat and the Republican Party, it's a big sham.
[02:40:34.036 --> 02:40:35.777]  It's all a Hegelian dialectic scam.
[02:40:36.237 --> 02:40:39.318]  But what do you think is on the horizon for 2008?
[02:40:40.279 --> 02:40:41.479]  They mentioned Newt Gingrich.
[02:40:42.900 --> 02:40:44.360]  I'll tell you what's on the horizon.
[02:40:44.981 --> 02:40:47.842]  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Rudolph Giuliani running together.
[02:40:48.142 --> 02:40:49.262]  Okay, so they would run together.
[02:40:49.483 --> 02:40:51.503]  And by then there'll be some huge terror attack.
[02:40:51.543 --> 02:40:55.825]  And during that, they've already started passing the enacting laws.
[02:40:55.845 --> 02:40:57.746]  They'll start a constitutional convention.
[02:40:58.767 --> 02:41:01.709]  Or a amendment that goes to the states.
[02:41:01.729 --> 02:41:03.151]  There's two different ways to do it.
[02:41:03.591 --> 02:41:06.393]  And during all this hysteria, they're going to pass all this.
[02:41:06.634 --> 02:41:09.656]  Well, they're going to be able to, they're going to have, they can do it at the last minute.
[02:41:09.676 --> 02:41:11.098]  They can do it in one day if they want to.
[02:41:11.118 --> 02:41:14.661]  But they've already practically declared the Constitution null and void.
[02:41:15.049 --> 02:41:18.930]  So it's just a matter of, but why are you so sure that Arnold would be the man?
[02:41:18.970 --> 02:41:21.691]  Why would the people vote for Arnold versus- They're not going to vote.
[02:41:22.351 --> 02:41:25.071]  Uh, 35% of the country now has them.
[02:41:25.331 --> 02:41:32.033]  By the next two year election, off year election, they're saying it's going to be over 70% will be the special no record voting machines.
[02:41:32.233 --> 02:41:32.433]  Right.
[02:41:32.493 --> 02:41:36.294]  And uh, by uh, 2008 it's going to be like 80-something percent.
[02:41:36.334 --> 02:41:36.714]  It's over.
[02:41:37.344 --> 02:41:43.118]  Well, I mean, the people are going to have to know that... I mean, I know it'll be a... No, they won't know!
[02:41:43.138 --> 02:41:44.381]  They won't know!
[02:41:44.401 --> 02:41:44.923]  Okay.
[02:41:45.339 --> 02:41:47.521]  You're saying, in other words, you're sure that it's going to be those two?
[02:41:47.541 --> 02:41:49.682]  Well, I mean, they'll have enough idiots that do go vote.
[02:41:49.922 --> 02:41:50.163]  Yeah.
[02:41:50.423 --> 02:41:53.986]  I mean, Sean Hannity will say, Arnold's conservative, go vote for him, like he did for Governor.
[02:41:54.006 --> 02:41:54.326]  Right.
[02:41:54.346 --> 02:41:55.507]  There'll be people that vote for him.
[02:41:55.787 --> 02:41:55.907]  Yeah.
[02:41:56.147 --> 02:42:01.952]  What do you, one last thing, what do you think about the fact that they've totally thrown their hands up and said, we're not going to look for weapons of mass destruction?
[02:42:01.992 --> 02:42:10.658]  I mean, do you think that they've really poured... They're setting the precedent that we can lie to you, and we can do whatever we want, and we can change stories in midstream, and it just doesn't matter.
[02:42:10.918 --> 02:42:12.900]  Well, I guess that will... Keep up the good work, Alex.
[02:42:12.940 --> 02:42:13.100]  Thanks.
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:20.564]  Yeah, we have helicopters, we have tanks, we'll spray nerve gas on your cities if we want to, we'll take your guns, ha ha ha, it's conservative.
[02:42:20.904 --> 02:42:22.845]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:42:23.605 --> 02:42:25.186]  Let's talk to Don in Colorado.
[02:42:25.226 --> 02:42:25.947]  Don, go ahead.
[02:42:26.487 --> 02:42:42.115]  Yeah, I was thinking about what you were saying about the corruption of the court system and the lawyers and all this, and I feel that the lawyers are the weapons, the courtroom is the battlefield, the judge is the enemy, and your lawyers are the spies.
[02:42:43.323 --> 02:42:48.165]  And that's pretty much what I want to say, and I'll just listen in for whatever anybody else has to say.
[02:42:48.325 --> 02:42:48.665]  Thank you.
[02:42:49.045 --> 02:42:50.725]  Oh, I totally agree with you.
[02:42:50.985 --> 02:42:55.087]  It's, look, people that have moved here from Russia and China go, look, you're not free.
[02:42:55.607 --> 02:42:57.527]  It's just, it's a fancier facade.
[02:42:59.208 --> 02:43:00.048]  And we are free.
[02:43:00.108 --> 02:43:01.408]  We still are on the air fighting.
[02:43:01.629 --> 02:43:02.929]  We still have incredible freedoms.
[02:43:03.409 --> 02:43:06.750]  And the government's saying we don't have these freedoms now and trying to get rid of them.
[02:43:07.690 --> 02:43:12.872]  But it's like, you know, they're trying to change what we still believe we have that we do still have.
[02:43:13.579 --> 02:43:15.480]  They got a tough road to hoe.
[02:43:16.221 --> 02:43:20.623]  Let's talk to Patrick in San Diego, California.
[02:43:21.143 --> 02:43:21.664]  Oh, hi Alex.
[02:43:21.804 --> 02:43:22.464]  Hello sir.
[02:43:22.644 --> 02:43:23.445]  First time calling in.
[02:43:23.725 --> 02:43:24.085]  Welcome.
[02:43:24.385 --> 02:43:26.707]  I wanted to talk a little bit about Thomas P.M.
[02:43:26.747 --> 02:43:28.628]  Barnett of the U.S.
[02:43:28.668 --> 02:43:29.448]  Naval War College.
[02:43:29.828 --> 02:43:30.108]  Yes.
[02:43:30.589 --> 02:43:31.389]  I think that P.M.
[02:43:31.409 --> 02:43:32.770]  stands for Pig Minion.
[02:43:33.490 --> 02:43:34.451]  This guy is incredible.
[02:43:37.132 --> 02:43:42.476]  I was doing some research and I came across his website and it's disturbing to say the least.
[02:43:44.418 --> 02:43:46.120]  He has a weblog.
[02:43:46.140 --> 02:43:47.661]  Yeah, I know.
[02:43:47.701 --> 02:43:48.402]  He attacks me.
[02:43:48.722 --> 02:43:50.524]  Yeah, pretty regularly.
[02:43:51.124 --> 02:43:55.488]  But in one of his recent entries, he mentions that he's a charter member of the Illuminati.
[02:43:56.849 --> 02:43:58.711]  I'm sure he's being sarcastic.
[02:43:59.472 --> 02:44:06.378]  Well, actually, there's a link next to it, and it goes to a very strange kind of New Age pseudo-Christian website with some messiah-like figure.
[02:44:07.822 --> 02:44:08.802]  It was so bizarre.
[02:44:08.862 --> 02:44:10.043]  Are you talking about Barnett?
[02:44:10.303 --> 02:44:11.923]  Yeah.
[02:44:11.963 --> 02:44:18.424]  Well, again, this is the guy who openly, he's like the darling of the Pentagon, top strategist at the Naval War College.
[02:44:18.764 --> 02:44:28.546]  I just tuned in one night, I didn't know who he was, and he was going, global system, we serve it, we work for Wall Street, we will invade the planet, and he had like weird music playing all the time.
[02:44:28.586 --> 02:44:30.547]  Yeah, you're talking about the brief on C-SPAN.
[02:44:31.787 --> 02:44:52.405]  And all these generals are going, yes, yes, and he's like, he openly said, we serve Wall Street, we will invade the globe, that's who we work for now, and he shows all these hundreds of third world countries to be invaded, and then I call him up to have him as a guest, he says yes, types my name in, he says in his blog, the university alerted me about the dangerous Jones.
[02:44:52.945 --> 02:44:55.906]  And then he admits that he cussed at me, doesn't he, in that weblog?
[02:44:55.926 --> 02:44:57.747]  He does, but I just thought it was really funny.
[02:44:57.827 --> 02:45:00.988]  I called him up, and this is important, and I said, you know something?
[02:45:01.448 --> 02:45:03.088]  I go, you're a coward for not coming on.
[02:45:03.108 --> 02:45:07.430]  He starts laughing at me real evilly, and I said, you know, the New World Order is going to fail.
[02:45:07.850 --> 02:45:09.090]  All this evil is going to fail.
[02:45:09.110 --> 02:45:12.912]  And he just goes, you keep on dreaming.
[02:45:13.032 --> 02:45:14.112]  Yeah, he's pretty sadistic.
[02:45:14.132 --> 02:45:16.213]  There's not enough adjectives in the English language.
[02:45:16.233 --> 02:45:16.853]  But imagine!
[02:45:16.873 --> 02:45:18.734]  Your New World Order is going to fail!
[02:45:20.801 --> 02:45:24.143]  And he snarls and says, keep on dreamin'!
[02:45:25.163 --> 02:45:26.764]  I mean, it's that out in the open now!
[02:45:26.784 --> 02:45:30.705]  He's dancing around on TV, talking about world government!
[02:45:31.286 --> 02:45:32.186]  Yeah, he's sick.
[02:45:32.246 --> 02:45:35.207]  Anyway, I just wanted to... So now, wait a minute, he's saying stuff about me again?
[02:45:35.808 --> 02:45:40.089]  Well, nothing new that, you know, you've probably seen everything he's already said.
[02:45:40.149 --> 02:45:47.453]  It's just this statement he makes about being a charter member of the Illuminati, and then he puts a link to a Christian kind of
[02:45:48.908 --> 02:45:50.749]  You know, New Age type website.
[02:45:50.809 --> 02:45:53.031]  It's actually against the very things that he's for.
[02:45:53.211 --> 02:45:57.974]  And it was so bizarre that I had to look at it a few times just to verify I was actually seeing that.
[02:45:58.714 --> 02:45:59.875]  And I wanted to get your take on it.
[02:45:59.895 --> 02:46:08.281]  I sent you the link to his website so you can even go look at it and look at this New Age website that he's linked to.
[02:46:08.321 --> 02:46:14.325]  But imagine saying to one of the chief strategists of the Pentagon, sir, the New World Order is going to be defeated.
[02:46:14.345 --> 02:46:16.646]  That's the stuff like humanity is going to win.
[02:46:18.129 --> 02:46:24.173]  And he just said, I mean, he just snarled, just keep on dreamin'.
[02:46:24.193 --> 02:46:27.835]  Well, he's got another thing coming.
[02:46:27.855 --> 02:46:30.657]  I mean, literally, yes sir, thank you, huh?
[02:46:31.117 --> 02:46:33.559]  Yeah, he's gonna lose, so, anyway, thanks for taking my call.
[02:46:34.219 --> 02:46:34.880]  Yeah, thank you.
[02:46:34.960 --> 02:46:36.741]  I mean, literally, folks, you should have heard the conversation.
[02:46:37.321 --> 02:46:43.986]  I was there on the studio phone, I was like, well, come on, please, sir, come on, even if your ideas are, you know, we've got General Parton coming on and, you know, he'd like to hear you.
[02:46:44.781 --> 02:46:53.823]  And we like to hear about how we work for global government and work for the corporations and I'd like to... It's just, oh yeah, I'm not going on your show, you bleeper.
[02:46:54.323 --> 02:46:56.624]  Oh please, now, come now, come on!
[02:46:56.644 --> 02:46:59.845]  And finally I just said, man, you really serve the New World Order.
[02:46:59.865 --> 02:47:01.625]  I go, you guys are not going to win.
[02:47:02.485 --> 02:47:05.286]  He's going, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:47:06.206 --> 02:47:08.567]  I'm just like, well, you're going to be defeated.
[02:47:08.587 --> 02:47:09.787]  The New World Order will be defeated.
[02:47:09.807 --> 02:47:12.728]  I mean, he knows!
[02:47:13.962 --> 02:47:22.670]  You just keep on dreaming.
[02:47:22.810 --> 02:47:23.490]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:24.311 --> 02:47:25.112]  Thank you.
[02:47:25.132 --> 02:47:26.453]  Nice talking to you.
[02:47:26.493 --> 02:47:28.094]  How's the meals about doing today?
[02:47:28.114 --> 02:47:33.739]  We're going to come back and hit some final news and try to jam a caller or two in.
[02:47:33.759 --> 02:47:35.281]  Maybe we're on to New York.
[02:47:35.301 --> 02:47:36.642]  A load of fun lines here at the end.
[02:47:36.682 --> 02:47:38.363]  But we've got a lot of calls this hour.
[02:47:38.383 --> 02:47:39.164]  We've got quite a few.
[02:47:41.329 --> 02:47:42.590]  Hey, I got 60 seconds.
[02:47:42.690 --> 02:47:48.132]  If you care about the country, you want the most powerful info out there, pretty sad to say I've got the most powerful info.
[02:47:48.192 --> 02:47:48.772]  It could be better.
[02:47:49.192 --> 02:47:50.852]  But I got some great videos.
[02:47:50.872 --> 02:47:51.493]  You need to have them.
[02:47:51.513 --> 02:47:52.833]  I'll authorize you to make copies.
[02:47:53.513 --> 02:47:57.695]  And if you want to let these people giggle and say that we're going to dream of freedom, fine.
[02:47:57.715 --> 02:47:58.675]  I'm going to dream of freedom.
[02:47:59.015 --> 02:48:00.936]  I'm going to dream of not having a global government.
[02:48:01.336 --> 02:48:02.097]  Get the videos.
[02:48:02.237 --> 02:48:03.017]  Make copies of them.
[02:48:03.037 --> 02:48:03.817]  Get them out to people.
[02:48:04.337 --> 02:48:08.499]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and
[02:48:09.775 --> 02:48:15.958]  Get a bunch of the videos, a bunch of insane specials still going on, as low as $5.95 per film.
[02:48:15.978 --> 02:48:16.758]  I mean, that's insane.
[02:48:17.399 --> 02:48:19.760]  And get them and make copies of them and get them out to people!
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:20.980]  Folks, come on!
[02:48:21.481 --> 02:48:23.461]  Join me in this fight against the new world, Odor.

[02:48:39.845 --> 02:48:41.486]  888-253-3139.
[02:48:41.626 --> 02:48:42.366]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.648 --> 02:48:50.011]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.171 --> 02:48:53.833]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the new
[02:48:56.491 --> 02:48:59.132]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.152 --> 02:49:02.073]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:49:02.293 --> 02:49:06.515]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.575 --> 02:49:13.498]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.638 --> 02:49:15.639]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.899 --> 02:49:26.505]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, Force Vaccinations, The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan-American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.645 --> 02:49:32.048]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:49:32.528 --> 02:49:36.430]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.450 --> 02:49:36.891]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.971 --> 02:49:38.732]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:45.333 --> 02:49:50.555]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:50.695 --> 02:49:58.778]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.038 --> 02:50:06.080]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.280 --> 02:50:07.541]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:07.621 --> 02:50:13.524]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.704 --> 02:50:18.807]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:18.927 --> 02:50:27.793]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.053 --> 02:50:31.355]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:55.290 --> 02:51:56.852]  Just keep on dreamin'.
[02:51:57.252 --> 02:51:59.615]  That was about like it was.
[02:52:00.736 --> 02:52:05.902]  He didn't quite go... But it was pretty darn close.
[02:52:06.903 --> 02:52:07.804]  And imagine that.
[02:52:07.884 --> 02:52:09.045]  Just think about that.
[02:52:09.225 --> 02:52:11.147]  Just think about who you serve.
[02:52:11.508 --> 02:52:13.210]  Those of you out there listening are a part of this.
[02:52:14.577 --> 02:52:20.944]  And they know you don't watch C-SPAN, they know you don't read RAND Corporation documents and Army and Naval War College reports.
[02:52:21.304 --> 02:52:22.265]  They know you don't read this.
[02:52:22.605 --> 02:52:24.908]  They know you don't read the text, as I did last night.
[02:52:26.221 --> 02:52:28.363]  of Governor Ridge in London, U.S.
[02:52:28.383 --> 02:52:42.275]  Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge on Friday called for a new international standard and again he put this text out days ago for putting biometric data on passports and said the technology could play a vital role in combating terrorism.
[02:52:42.755 --> 02:52:52.464]  American passports in the next few months are going to have these chips in them but he talked about the international order taking great strides
[02:52:53.084 --> 02:52:56.965]  Towards unifying this into a world ID system.
[02:52:58.026 --> 02:53:01.387]  Common international standards of biometrics must be developed.
[02:53:01.727 --> 02:53:03.627]  In my view, the sooner the better, he said.
[02:53:03.647 --> 02:53:07.068]  Of course, the UN ordered this through treaties four years ago.
[02:53:08.409 --> 02:53:11.950]  Meanwhile, JFK Airport, passengers must retina scan.
[02:53:14.270 --> 02:53:19.312]  Ah, you'll soon have to stop through and zap your iris, it says.
[02:53:20.874 --> 02:53:25.675]  Our vision is to enhance our security and facilitate the legitimate flow of trade and travel.
[02:53:26.295 --> 02:53:27.155]  To and from.
[02:53:27.175 --> 02:53:29.156]  Homeland Security Ridge said.
[02:53:30.216 --> 02:53:30.656]  Oh, man.
[02:53:30.676 --> 02:53:31.997]  I'm going to vomit.
[02:53:32.957 --> 02:53:34.557]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[02:53:34.697 --> 02:53:35.697]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:53:35.757 --> 02:53:36.378]  Welcome, sir.
[02:53:36.398 --> 02:53:37.838]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:53:37.958 --> 02:53:39.378]  Alex, read Jeremiah 1.
[02:53:39.418 --> 02:53:42.919]  That's you, me, and others who are combating this evil.
[02:53:43.179 --> 02:53:46.740]  I've got to talk real fast because you don't have much time, but we have a stockbroker
[02:53:47.581 --> 02:53:49.143]  Who's daughter worked at the Trade Tower.
[02:53:49.164 --> 02:53:51.206]  She was on her way to work that morning in a cab.
[02:53:51.727 --> 02:53:57.555]  She had a call from a Jewish co-worker who said, get out of the cab and go home.
[02:53:57.976 --> 02:53:58.997]  Don't go to work today.
[02:53:59.358 --> 02:54:00.019]  Get out of the cab.
[02:54:00.059 --> 02:54:00.640]  Do not go.
[02:54:01.261 --> 02:54:04.365]  He knew because the embassy, as you may know, and this was documented.
[02:54:05.432 --> 02:54:10.435]  700 and some odd Jewish executives did not go to work at the Trade Towers that morning.
[02:54:10.475 --> 02:54:11.596]  The word was passed down.
[02:54:11.616 --> 02:54:13.737]  There weren't Arabs in the building either.
[02:54:14.157 --> 02:54:15.818]  Now, let me go over this.
[02:54:15.998 --> 02:54:18.659]  And what the media does is put a spin on it that, oh, you're anti-Semitic.
[02:54:19.000 --> 02:54:19.620]  No, folks.
[02:54:20.500 --> 02:54:27.166]  It is admitted MSNBC, and I'm putting this in a new film, went and quote investigated the Urban Legend and found out it was true.
[02:54:27.206 --> 02:54:30.489]  Little Arab kids were saying those buildings won't be there in two days.
[02:54:31.009 --> 02:54:32.611]  Little Jewish kids were saying it.
[02:54:34.492 --> 02:54:39.697]  The Odigo, this was Jerusalem Post folks, said yes, the warning went out.
[02:54:40.177 --> 02:54:41.117]  Get out of the building!
[02:54:41.358 --> 02:54:42.278]  Navy SEALS!
[02:54:42.298 --> 02:54:44.379]  I've interviewed people who called their family members.
[02:54:44.399 --> 02:54:45.919]  Navy SEALS who called their family members.
[02:54:46.159 --> 02:54:48.240]  They said, do not go to work today!
[02:54:48.620 --> 02:54:49.821]  EVERYBODY KNEW!
[02:54:50.501 --> 02:54:52.822]  But Alex, the point is that Chertoff, well connected.
[02:54:52.842 --> 02:54:55.903]  He's the son of a rabbi from the New York metro area.
[02:54:56.303 --> 02:55:01.245]  Certainly well connected with the higher Israeli and Jewish people.
[02:55:02.345 --> 02:55:07.127]  He must have known, had to have known that this went down and this was so.
[02:55:07.147 --> 02:55:07.767]  Now he is
[02:55:08.831 --> 02:55:26.935]  In charge of Homeland Security to imprison the rest of us, and yet he knows what went down, and what really, that it was foreknowledge, it was known beforehand, and he is appointed now to regulate the rest of us, having known all of this information.
[02:55:27.615 --> 02:55:29.995]  How deceitful and deceptive.
[02:55:30.316 --> 02:55:31.996]  He was the head guy running the 9-11 cover-up!
[02:55:34.941 --> 02:55:37.062]  I tell you, Chertoff is a real piece of work.
[02:55:37.242 --> 02:55:39.583]  The dots connect, Alex, right here.
[02:55:39.823 --> 02:55:40.863]  Well, they sure do.
[02:55:40.943 --> 02:55:41.723]  Good points, Ron.
[02:55:41.743 --> 02:55:42.443]  Thanks for the call.

[02:56:12.279 --> 02:56:14.080]  Uh, yeah.

[02:56:23.362 --> 02:56:24.602]  They say, don't worry, it's gonna happen.
[02:56:24.922 --> 02:56:26.123]  Not a question of if, but when.
[02:56:26.503 --> 02:56:28.863]  And then we're gonna rule you, okay?
