[00:00:05.558 --> 00:00:06.199]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:07.940]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.641 --> 00:00:09.942]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.402 --> 00:00:11.223]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:12.944]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:17.167]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.708 --> 00:00:22.151]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.516 --> 00:00:33.380]  The police will just go in people's houses, old ladies, you name it.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:48.684]  In high and dry areas, where they had plenty of food and water, and they would tackle old ladies, tackle young men, tackle old men, drag old vets out of their houses.
[00:00:49.624 --> 00:00:50.824]  It's a lot of fun.
[00:00:50.844 --> 00:00:52.465]  They don't lock the front door.
[00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:54.585]  They don't give you food or water.
[00:00:54.665 --> 00:00:57.106]  They don't let you get your jewelry.
[00:00:57.126 --> 00:00:57.446]  Nothing.
[00:00:59.204 --> 00:01:01.566]  They love tackling old women.
[00:01:01.586 --> 00:01:02.847]  There's nothing better.
[00:01:03.087 --> 00:01:09.612]  America is all about some goon in a black uniform tackling an old lady.
[00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:16.358]  That, my friends, is what the founding fathers said this country was all about.
[00:01:16.518 --> 00:01:17.839]  Tackling old women.
[00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.922]  That's freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:21.762 --> 00:01:23.724]  Maybe we can start hanging old women.
[00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:25.025]  Maybe while they're hanging...
[00:01:25.663 --> 00:01:29.245]  Have them walk up with a saber and just slash their guts open.
[00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:30.786]  Hail America!
[00:01:31.627 --> 00:01:32.647]  Watch the guts pour out.
[00:01:32.727 --> 00:01:33.988]  Hail, hail, hail!
[00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:35.009]  Hail freedom!
[00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:36.330]  Hail, hail, hail!
[00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.352]  I mean, it's just, hey, I shouldn't joke around.
[00:01:39.372 --> 00:01:40.592]  They'll probably be doing that soon.
[00:01:42.393 --> 00:01:45.775]  It just goes from bad to worse.
[00:01:46.456 --> 00:01:50.719]  NRA comments on the gun confiscation in New Orleans.
[00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.960]  This is from the NRA website.
[00:01:54.415 --> 00:02:04.282]  And yes, ladies and gentlemen, I have actually received emails denying that gun confiscation is going on.
[00:02:04.382 --> 00:02:10.046]  And of course, it is drooling bush worshippers that are sending me these emails.
[00:02:10.386 --> 00:02:15.449]  Any denial that is needed will be made.
[00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:19.012]  Any excuse to be a slave...
[00:02:19.918 --> 00:02:24.381]  Any excuse to feel good about yourselves, you will engage in it.
[00:02:25.923 --> 00:02:27.784]  Hey, I'm against turning our guns in.
[00:02:27.904 --> 00:02:29.865]  I know that means I'm a liberal.
[00:02:30.086 --> 00:02:30.646]  So be it.
[00:02:31.326 --> 00:02:39.833]  You who are anti-gun, pro-abortion, pro-open border, pro-world government, you are the new conservatives.
[00:02:39.993 --> 00:02:40.633]  I agree.
[00:02:40.653 --> 00:02:41.954]  It is true.
[00:02:42.114 --> 00:02:42.715]  I'm a leftist.
[00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:48.002]  NRA comments on gun confiscation in New Orleans.
[00:02:48.062 --> 00:02:57.105]  Hurricane Ophelia still idling off the coast, menacing Florida and the Carolinas as well as Georgia.
[00:02:59.545 --> 00:03:06.327]  Now in a piece of disinfo, because it's still ongoing, police won't force holdouts removal.
[00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:14.450]  First General HonorÃ© on Saturday said the military's not going to aid the police in these gun confiscations because it's just so unpopular.
[00:03:15.353 --> 00:03:17.274]  And then the police said, well, we're going to continue.
[00:03:17.314 --> 00:03:23.656]  But now today, they're saying, well, we'll just selectively do it.
[00:03:25.096 --> 00:03:30.658]  That is, if you look like a pushover, if you're an old woman, well, we're powerful men.
[00:03:30.858 --> 00:03:34.159]  These are guys who never made the football team.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.341]  These are guys who always felt like wimps, but wanted to bully people.
[00:03:39.313 --> 00:03:45.337]  These are people that are totally cowardly, and if they can corner an old woman and tackle her, they're going to do it, folks.
[00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.039]  By the way, I'm not joking.
[00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.380]  We have video clips up on the website.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.662]  We're going to play the audio from one here later.
[00:03:52.523 --> 00:03:56.385]  And so they're going to have their way with your old women.
[00:03:56.465 --> 00:04:02.370]  It's just part of the power, part of the power of these cowards, of these pieces of filth.
[00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.271]  But Katrina...
[00:04:05.262 --> 00:04:08.163]  Police won't force holdouts removal.
[00:04:08.663 --> 00:04:15.745]  Man, I tell you, these cops will cower in fear of a couple of bug-eyed looters with shotguns that don't know how to aim them.
[00:04:16.826 --> 00:04:23.768]  But man, they are more than happy to go into these middle-class neighborhoods and just backhand fathers with their children.
[00:04:24.108 --> 00:04:24.728]  Shut up!
[00:04:24.808 --> 00:04:27.089]  Get out of my way!
[00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:28.609]  Give me that gun!
[00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:29.690]  I mean, it's that bad.
[00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.571]  So they're having their way.
[00:04:35.146 --> 00:04:39.109]  Just get in that party wagon and shut your mouth!
[00:04:39.149 --> 00:04:41.051]  We're in control!
[00:04:42.512 --> 00:04:44.734]  Oh, I forgot the clip of them killing people's dogs.
[00:04:44.794 --> 00:04:46.975]  I forgot to email that to the network from the download.
[00:04:47.716 --> 00:04:49.057]  It's a clip from Saturday.
[00:04:49.097 --> 00:04:51.379]  Click on the calendar a few days ago on prisonbundle.com.
[00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:56.363]  We have a Dallas Morning News video of them killing people's dogs.
[00:04:57.964 --> 00:05:00.426]  Personally, that's nothing compared to beating up old ladies.
[00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:05.362]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.622 --> 00:05:07.202]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.522 --> 00:05:12.204]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.544 --> 00:05:16.985]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.385 --> 00:05:21.566]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.786 --> 00:05:24.627]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.727 --> 00:05:29.389]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:34.031]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:41.453]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.713 --> 00:05:44.134]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.294 --> 00:05:46.035]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.457 --> 00:06:06.742]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:06:06.962 --> 00:06:09.044]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:06:09.284 --> 00:06:16.390]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:28.040]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:29.161]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.441 --> 00:07:08.243]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:13.824]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:07:14.244 --> 00:07:17.265]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:08:07.099 --> 00:08:08.180]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:09.981]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.642 --> 00:08:11.443]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.203 --> 00:08:13.724]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:17.708]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.948 --> 00:08:22.092]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.213 --> 00:08:27.496]  All right, my friends, it is Monday.
[00:08:28.983 --> 00:08:30.865]  The 12th day of September 2005.
[00:08:30.905 --> 00:08:34.368]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:08:35.028 --> 00:08:39.272]  A lot to respond to that we witnessed over the weekend.
[00:08:39.792 --> 00:08:46.417]  The propaganda, the manipulation, both parties teaming up to further enslave the American people.
[00:08:47.398 --> 00:08:51.501]  I never understand why talk show hosts will have open line Friday.
[00:08:51.521 --> 00:08:54.544]  Why not have open line Monday?
[00:08:55.279 --> 00:09:00.890]  Because people have been chomping at the bit all weekend to call into talk shows.
[00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:05.639]  There's two or three days of news that has stacked up.
[00:09:07.626 --> 00:09:12.470]  I guess because there's two or three days of news stacked up, the talk show hosts end up not going to your calls.
[00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.092]  But we will take your calls throughout this broadcast today.
[00:09:16.112 --> 00:09:16.853]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:16.873 --> 00:09:31.423]  You want to talk about the fourth anniversary of 9-11 and the big propaganda fest that the overlords of the New World Order had in D.C.
[00:09:31.483 --> 00:09:32.084]  and New York?
[00:09:32.853 --> 00:09:39.298]  Do you want to discuss the continual economic ramifications of Hurricane Katrina?
[00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:48.785]  Or are you watching Las Vegas place bets on other hurricanes that could be slamming into the East Coast?
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.681]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:55.481 --> 00:10:02.102]  The websites are infowars.com, prisonplanet.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:10:02.663 --> 00:10:16.085]  Coming up later, we have a clip from ABC News where they talk about the levees and they talk about potential bombs on the levees.
[00:10:16.685 --> 00:10:19.046]  Then we have another clip where...
[00:10:19.887 --> 00:10:34.933]  Bill Clinton and George Bush are in a press conference, basically worshipping each other for 15 minutes at first, and then they take a few questions, and one of the reporters asks Clinton about the reports of bombs on the levees, and they just walk off the stage.
[00:10:35.413 --> 00:10:40.175]  We have that posted on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com as well.
[00:10:42.196 --> 00:10:45.337]  And then we have several other clips.
[00:10:46.569 --> 00:10:49.872]  One of these clips is an old lady.
[00:10:50.913 --> 00:10:57.459]  Looks like she's about 75 years old in a high and dry middle class neighborhood.
[00:10:57.499 --> 00:10:58.700]  There's no water anywhere.
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:05.045]  And the press is just walking around with video cameras inside her house with the police.
[00:11:05.105 --> 00:11:13.633]  These are the embedded reporters who enjoy going in people's homes and violating their privacy just on a massive level.
[00:11:14.508 --> 00:11:17.210]  And she's arguing with the police going, I don't want to go.
[00:11:18.211 --> 00:11:22.955]  And they're there demanding that she turn in her firearms, or I guess her dead husband's pistol.
[00:11:24.776 --> 00:11:31.021]  And she's trying to go ahead and give up the firearm to them.
[00:11:31.941 --> 00:11:35.424]  She's trying to grovel properly, but saying, I don't want to leave my home.
[00:11:36.365 --> 00:11:41.389]  And so one of these punk cops, probably a hardcore gang member in high school,
[00:11:42.208 --> 00:11:42.849]  Tackles her.
[00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:45.051]  I mean, he is a stud muffin.
[00:11:45.872 --> 00:11:47.794]  I mean, he knows how to tackle an old woman.
[00:11:47.814 --> 00:11:51.017]  These guys are just getting to be more and more powerful by the day.
[00:11:51.638 --> 00:11:58.225]  Well, it's like tasering 95-year-old women and knocking their fake eyes out while you punch them in the face in front of neighbors.
[00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:02.449]  I mean, only the toughest men have had a pound on old women.
[00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:03.230]  I mean, it just...
[00:12:04.808 --> 00:12:05.889]  These are commandos.
[00:12:05.929 --> 00:12:10.771]  They put the Delta Force and the Green Berets and the Navy SEALs to shame.
[00:12:10.811 --> 00:12:15.713]  I mean, in all their combat gear, they're able to take on the most vicious creatures on Earth, elderly women.
[00:12:17.193 --> 00:12:18.094]  We have several clips.
[00:12:18.114 --> 00:12:21.335]  We have the O'Reilly Factor clip that we have up on prisonplanet.com.
[00:12:22.395 --> 00:12:25.236]  And I'm told that Gary Brownfield played a longer clip today.
[00:12:25.256 --> 00:12:28.918]  We're going to grab the clip he played and play that coming up as well.
[00:12:31.013 --> 00:12:32.654]  But I'm getting denials.
[00:12:32.994 --> 00:12:37.836]  I've gotten a few emails like, Alex, again, you're full of bleeping bleep.
[00:12:37.856 --> 00:12:42.138]  You know, just stuff along those lines.
[00:12:42.698 --> 00:12:44.719]  George Bush isn't confiscating guns.
[00:12:44.779 --> 00:12:46.359]  They're not confiscating guns.
[00:12:47.780 --> 00:12:51.642]  In New Orleans, they're taking guns from gang members.
[00:12:52.842 --> 00:12:55.984]  So again, see, they've sold the neocons on gun control.
[00:12:56.044 --> 00:12:59.365]  But, oh, we can't have the gang members with guns.
[00:13:00.877 --> 00:13:05.339]  And, oh, you saw those looters of almost two weeks ago.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:08.221]  So, you know, a week and a half ago.
[00:13:08.301 --> 00:13:10.522]  So we've got to do something.
[00:13:10.562 --> 00:13:11.883]  We've got to stop them.
[00:13:13.143 --> 00:13:21.507]  Do you understand that the government, knowingly for at least four days, didn't bring in food or water?
[00:13:22.468 --> 00:13:24.089]  Society broke down.
[00:13:24.809 --> 00:13:30.272]  The police admit they had to break into stores themselves to get food and water.
[00:13:31.289 --> 00:13:35.010]  FEMA admittedly, this is mainstream news.
[00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.250]  I'm not letting this go.
[00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.091]  Jammed police communications.
[00:13:39.711 --> 00:13:42.832]  State and city and county.
[00:13:43.252 --> 00:13:44.272]  City and parish.
[00:13:45.772 --> 00:13:50.113]  They jammed state, city, and parish communications.
[00:13:50.574 --> 00:13:53.214]  They snuck in and cut communications lines.
[00:13:53.614 --> 00:13:56.415]  They blocked the Red Cross, the Salvation Army.
[00:13:57.490 --> 00:14:01.872]  Walmart, the Coast Guard, and a dozen dozen other groups.
[00:14:01.932 --> 00:14:05.673]  I mean, folks, there's so many articles on this, it makes my head spin.
[00:14:06.273 --> 00:14:26.461]  Actively, energetically, in a focused manner, not a bunch of buffoons as they've been portrayed, in a focused military manner, they blocked aid, knowing that it would cause riots, knowing it would cause breakdowns, then they get to point news cameras at it and bring in massive control.
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:35.243]  In my film, Police State to the Takeover, in the two-hour film, we spend the first 35 minutes in Seattle in 1999.
[00:14:36.824 --> 00:14:38.525]  We have the police chief.
[00:14:38.685 --> 00:14:40.426]  We have the police.
[00:14:40.626 --> 00:14:43.588]  We have the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[00:14:44.748 --> 00:14:56.354]  We have the Seattle Times, Seattle Weekly, all reporting that 50 black bloc anarchists were hired by the government
[00:14:57.614 --> 00:14:59.935]  We're trained at a training base in Oregon.
[00:15:00.515 --> 00:15:02.776]  We're shipped to Seattle two weeks before.
[00:15:03.937 --> 00:15:06.298]  You had 60,000 peaceful protesters.
[00:15:06.958 --> 00:15:10.380]  The 50 went out, burned trash cans, busted windows.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:13.762]  We have cop after cop saying, I was ordered to let them loot.
[00:15:14.322 --> 00:15:21.205]  Then they retreated to a government-funded building where they were protected in a public city agreement.
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:25.942]  The national news kept showing images of the burning stuff the first day.
[00:15:26.422 --> 00:15:28.303]  The police were told, now attack!
[00:15:29.023 --> 00:15:32.245]  They even went into neighborhoods, breaking old women's arms.
[00:15:32.765 --> 00:15:36.006]  For some reason, these wolves target old women.
[00:15:36.287 --> 00:15:39.348]  They're seen, I guess, as the weakest, so they go after the weakest target.
[00:15:39.868 --> 00:15:43.570]  They savagely attacked members of the government.
[00:15:43.630 --> 00:15:46.271]  They savagely attacked off-duty cops.
[00:15:46.871 --> 00:15:48.612]  They went absolutely insane.
[00:15:48.632 --> 00:15:50.013]  They said, there's no free speech.
[00:15:50.794 --> 00:15:51.434]  No nothing.
[00:15:51.834 --> 00:15:58.636]  And then Seattle was used as a model all over the country for a police state.
[00:15:58.956 --> 00:16:03.818]  For militarized federal police dressed up in ninja Darth Vader outfits.
[00:16:06.539 --> 00:16:13.621]  And Delta Force, according to the police and three Seattle newspapers, was in command.
[00:16:13.921 --> 00:16:16.002]  The Delta Force.
[00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:18.102]  The Delta Force.
[00:16:18.902 --> 00:16:20.503]  The most elite military unit
[00:16:21.218 --> 00:16:31.145]  Was in control, an entire squadron of Delta Force was in control of the anarchists and were commanding them.
[00:16:32.245 --> 00:16:38.249]  Seattle Times, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Seattle Weekly.
[00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:46.735]  Now, in this case, you just don't give welfare people food and water for three or four days, you're going to get a problem.
[00:16:47.175 --> 00:16:49.417]  You do that with yuppies, you're going to get a problem.
[00:16:51.408 --> 00:16:54.230]  And there were small pockets of looters and rioters.
[00:16:54.430 --> 00:16:55.050]  Very small.
[00:16:55.731 --> 00:16:57.552]  The police, just like they did in the L.A.
[00:16:57.612 --> 00:17:00.194]  riots, sat back.
[00:17:00.254 --> 00:17:01.935]  I've heard Daryl Gates admit they sat back.
[00:17:02.475 --> 00:17:04.877]  It was Korean shopkeepers that held a lot of it back.
[00:17:05.157 --> 00:17:08.759]  The firefighters went in and got shot at, but the cops held back.
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:11.861]  It's just like at Columbine.
[00:17:12.001 --> 00:17:13.982]  Four hours, 15 minutes.
[00:17:14.503 --> 00:17:15.664]  Didn't go into that building.
[00:17:17.905 --> 00:17:20.186]  Four hours, 15 minutes.
[00:17:22.535 --> 00:17:23.836]  You're going, well, what's your point?
[00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:25.056]  How does this tie into Katrina?
[00:17:25.876 --> 00:17:26.957]  It's the same thing, folks.
[00:17:27.017 --> 00:17:28.477]  They know what they're doing.
[00:17:28.517 --> 00:17:29.718]  They knew what they were doing.
[00:17:30.058 --> 00:17:30.638]  FEMA did.
[00:17:31.899 --> 00:17:35.720]  And then now they've got their excuse for gun confiscation, total control.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:38.901]  Look, 30% of the city is now above water.
[00:17:38.921 --> 00:17:40.542]  20% was ever below water.
[00:17:40.982 --> 00:17:43.283]  These are areas on the edge of the city with roads.
[00:17:43.743 --> 00:17:46.204]  You know, five miles away are working gas stations.
[00:17:47.044 --> 00:17:49.245]  They don't need to move out.
[00:17:49.545 --> 00:17:51.086]  They don't have a problem.
[00:17:53.109 --> 00:17:58.012]  But the government wants to use this as an example of forced relocation and total control.
[00:17:58.512 --> 00:18:01.354]  My dad has a friend who's a lawyer.
[00:18:01.394 --> 00:18:02.674]  He was at dinner with him Friday.
[00:18:03.075 --> 00:18:04.476]  He's already been back to New Orleans.
[00:18:04.496 --> 00:18:05.776]  He'd just gotten back that morning.
[00:18:07.237 --> 00:18:13.020]  And he said, look, most of the suburbs are totally fine, and the roads are open.
[00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.061]  Nothing's underwater.
[00:18:14.081 --> 00:18:14.141]  And...
[00:18:16.937 --> 00:18:21.638]  I was driving in and out, and I had military helicopters on loudspeakers going, do you need to be rescued?
[00:18:21.678 --> 00:18:25.639]  And police trying to threaten me not to be there.
[00:18:26.379 --> 00:18:31.081]  And I live in a middle-class suburb of New Orleans.
[00:18:32.561 --> 00:18:36.522]  And there's no reason that they're trying to keep me out of there.
[00:18:36.542 --> 00:18:40.483]  And it's the same thing for hundreds of thousands of people.
[00:18:41.503 --> 00:18:44.584]  It's the center of the city that had 15 feet of water in it.
[00:18:46.568 --> 00:18:48.889]  So, they're setting their precedent.
[00:18:49.469 --> 00:18:59.914]  And then I get these emails denying... You see, when there's a real threat to your Second Amendment, you've shot your mouth off all these years, and now it's really happening, and you're going to make excuses.
[00:19:01.155 --> 00:19:04.697]  But for those that are doubting it, here's the New York Times article from last Friday.
[00:19:05.117 --> 00:19:08.318]  New Orleans begins confiscating firearms as water recedes.
[00:19:08.839 --> 00:19:11.660]  Waters are receding across the flood-beaten city today.
[00:19:13.012 --> 00:19:17.393]  As police officers began confiscating weapons, including illegally... Excuse me.
[00:19:17.813 --> 00:19:18.854]  She had a Freudian slip.
[00:19:18.934 --> 00:19:20.214]  I wish they were illegal guns.
[00:19:20.874 --> 00:19:34.978]  Waters were receding across the flood-beaten city today as police officers began confiscating weapons, including legally, legally registered... Oh, I thought you didn't register with the yellow form.
[00:19:35.458 --> 00:19:42.260]  ...from civilians in preparation for a mass forced evacuation of the residents still living there.
[00:19:43.067 --> 00:19:52.016]  No civilians in New Orleans will be allowed to carry pistols, shotguns, or other firearms, said Pete Edwards Cummings III, the superintendent of police.
[00:19:52.516 --> 00:19:58.222]  Only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons, unless you're Blackwater security mercenaries.
[00:20:02.026 --> 00:20:05.888]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:20:06.028 --> 00:20:07.770]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:09.110]  But not just any water.
[00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:13.393]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:20:13.473 --> 00:20:23.159]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:20:23.439 --> 00:20:23.960]  We're good to go.
[00:20:38.676 --> 00:20:39.577]  Or call 1-866-884-9104.
[00:20:39.597 --> 00:20:39.897]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:21:02.562 --> 00:21:05.044]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:21:05.725 --> 00:21:12.369]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:15.852]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:21:16.652 --> 00:21:22.837]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:21:23.761 --> 00:21:24.221]  We're good to go.
[00:21:24.341 --> 00:21:24.541]  I think?
[00:21:51.237 --> 00:21:51.257]  516-8736.
[00:21:51.377 --> 00:21:52.059]  Call now.
[00:21:52.099 --> 00:21:56.106]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:22:03.812 --> 00:22:04.993]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:05.394 --> 00:22:10.860]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:11.941]  That's right.
[00:22:12.261 --> 00:22:14.544]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:14.884 --> 00:22:22.032]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:22.589 --> 00:22:30.273]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:30.714 --> 00:22:35.576]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:36.217 --> 00:22:39.219]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:42.260]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.293 --> 00:23:05.174]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:23:05.514 --> 00:23:08.395]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:23:08.615 --> 00:23:14.817]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:23:15.197 --> 00:23:22.499]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:23:22.679 --> 00:23:26.760]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:32.582]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.
[00:23:32.782 --> 00:23:45.907]  Complete with over 3 gigabytes of detailed information on each of the 3,000-plus counties in the U.S., including 550 high-resolution, full-color maps and full-color photographs, as well as detailed information and analysis that you need.
[00:23:46.087 --> 00:23:54.710]  Get this hard-to-find information by ordering Fruit and Places USA now for only $29 plus shipping and handling by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:23:55.670 --> 00:24:15.398]  Now, obviously, you cannot watch the video on radio.
[00:24:16.679 --> 00:24:25.042]  But from press reports about this local newscast we're about to play that then got picked up by national television, this old lady...
[00:24:26.491 --> 00:24:31.015]  It has been told by the police to give them any weapons.
[00:24:32.156 --> 00:24:36.679]  And so she's got this old pistol, and she's holding it barrel first, you know, holding it out.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:39.622]  She's holding it in her hand.
[00:24:39.642 --> 00:24:41.103]  She doesn't have her finger in the trigger.
[00:24:42.104 --> 00:24:49.690]  And she's got the gesture, you know, holding it in her hand to give it to them, but she's saying, I'm not going to leave.
[00:24:50.731 --> 00:24:54.434]  And they turn that into a threat, and, you know, so tackle it.
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:58.584]  But it was all over the news, Friday and Saturday, dragging people out.
[00:24:58.904 --> 00:25:03.489]  And they're dragging her out, folks, and then they say, oh, we don't drag people out.
[00:25:03.929 --> 00:25:06.271]  They say that in this newscast.
[00:25:06.992 --> 00:25:13.679]  I mean, the mayor was on TV Thursday and Friday saying, you know, we're taking the challenge.
[00:25:13.719 --> 00:25:15.080]  We're going to force you out.
[00:25:16.402 --> 00:25:18.184]  And then General Honore...
[00:25:19.455 --> 00:25:21.276]  On Saturday he said, we're not going to help you.
[00:25:21.957 --> 00:25:25.098]  And so, for now, they've backed off a little bit.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.582]  But this isn't the job of the police to go around taking people out of their houses.
[00:25:32.062 --> 00:25:35.124]  Again, I will repeat, we wrote an article about this last Friday.
[00:25:37.065 --> 00:25:45.030]  There are power plant employees and nurses and doctors and police officers that live in these middle class areas
[00:25:45.903 --> 00:25:49.224]  And the cops come to their door and they say, where am I supposed to go?
[00:25:51.464 --> 00:25:54.204]  You know, we're still operating the power plant.
[00:25:54.845 --> 00:25:56.205]  The hospital's still open.
[00:25:56.525 --> 00:25:58.905]  Where do you go, officers, if you get snake bit?
[00:25:59.225 --> 00:26:00.265]  Or if you get in a car wreck?
[00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:01.226]  Or if you get shot?
[00:26:03.546 --> 00:26:10.207]  You know, they're begging us to stay at our jobs, but you want to go load me on a helicopter or load me on a military truck?
[00:26:10.627 --> 00:26:12.388]  Again, there's no logic here.
[00:26:13.148 --> 00:26:14.448]  Go ahead and roll this clip.
[00:26:14.468 --> 00:26:14.888]  Here it is.
[00:26:15.959 --> 00:26:21.884]  The flood waters are beginning to recede in New Orleans, but city officials are pressing ahead with their order for everyone to leave because of health reasons.
[00:26:22.304 --> 00:26:26.147]  Today, police were ordered to remove people by force if necessary.
[00:26:26.307 --> 00:26:32.152]  KTVU's Ken Wayne rode along with a unit of the California Highway Patrol and witnessed some residents putting up a fight.
[00:26:32.172 --> 00:26:33.673]  He joins us now from New Orleans.
[00:26:33.773 --> 00:26:33.893]  Ken.
[00:26:34.193 --> 00:26:39.577]  Dennis, California Highway Patrol has about 100 officers here, including 20 of them from the Bay Area.
[00:26:39.977 --> 00:26:45.261]  And they were out on the streets of New Orleans today, urging the few residents that remain to evacuate.
[00:26:45.582 --> 00:26:47.323]  But not everyone wanted to go.
[00:26:47.423 --> 00:26:50.145]  Officers found an elderly woman on Magazine Street.
[00:26:50.545 --> 00:26:53.648]  She had stayed behind with her two dogs and refused to come out.
[00:26:54.188 --> 00:26:58.952]  Officers finally got into the house and found the woman was armed with a handgun and a knife.
[00:26:59.752 --> 00:27:04.874]  You're going to have to shoot me because I'm not going to.
[00:27:05.034 --> 00:27:06.914]  Well, I don't want you in here.
[00:27:08.375 --> 00:27:10.415]  I don't want you in here, period.
[00:27:10.495 --> 00:27:11.056]  You son of a...
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.921]  It's their house.
[00:27:27.941 --> 00:27:28.441]  It's their home.
[00:27:28.781 --> 00:27:32.162]  And a lot of people, especially older people, they have dogs and it's like their loved ones.
[00:27:32.222 --> 00:27:35.462]  And they're scared they're going to lose their house and lose their dogs.
[00:27:35.482 --> 00:27:38.583]  So we probably all protect our own stuff.
[00:27:38.783 --> 00:27:38.923]  No!
[00:27:38.963 --> 00:27:40.864]  I'll sit on my porch!
[00:27:41.004 --> 00:27:42.564]  Let me sit on the porch!
[00:27:48.189 --> 00:28:01.622]  That woman was finally loaded onto a military cargo truck taken to the convention center and then to be processed, taken by helicopter to New Orleans airport and to be set up to where she could find a safe place to be.
[00:28:02.142 --> 00:28:07.367]  She was allowed to bring her two dogs along with her, but of course officers kept the gun and the knife.
[00:28:07.467 --> 00:28:09.129]  But it's an indication of what
[00:28:09.509 --> 00:28:17.954]  Highway Patrol officers and police from all over the nation are finding as they assist New Orleans police and Louisiana State Police in trying to evacuate this city.
[00:28:18.234 --> 00:28:18.854]  All right.
[00:28:19.154 --> 00:28:21.135]  And then they go on and babble some more.
[00:28:21.155 --> 00:28:26.418]  I want to play the O'Reilly Factor version when we get back, and then we'll take some calls.
[00:28:26.498 --> 00:28:33.222]  But notice that they say at the start of the newscast they're forcibly removing people.
[00:28:34.116 --> 00:28:38.257]  And then by the end of it, oh, we're not really forcing them, but we had to because she was armed.
[00:28:38.697 --> 00:28:41.598]  So now if you've got a knife in your house, and there's no knife in her hand.
[00:28:42.058 --> 00:28:43.398]  No, there's knives there in the kitchen.
[00:28:44.978 --> 00:28:48.319]  Or if you've got a gun, they can just hold it up and go, look, well, they had a gun.
[00:28:48.359 --> 00:28:49.499]  They had a knife in their house.
[00:28:49.879 --> 00:28:51.059]  They had a baseball bat.
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:52.580]  We had to do this.
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:54.340]  The officers were in danger.
[00:28:56.241 --> 00:28:58.161]  And so this is what you have to look forward to.
[00:28:58.381 --> 00:29:02.982]  In fact, they said last Wednesday that if you don't leave the city now...
[00:29:03.689 --> 00:29:08.231]  There's no more aid, no more food, no more water that's going to be brought in to anybody anywhere.
[00:29:08.611 --> 00:29:13.773]  Isn't it cheaper and better to bring it to people to each neighborhood where they can come out and get the food and water?
[00:29:14.353 --> 00:29:20.636]  It costs probably ten times as much to ship them out, to house them, to have security, to do all of this.
[00:29:21.836 --> 00:29:24.737]  Why not keep people in their houses where they can do it?
[00:29:25.338 --> 00:29:26.998]  There's just absolutely no reason.
[00:29:27.018 --> 00:29:29.539]  You know, there's talk of E. coli in the water.
[00:29:29.559 --> 00:29:30.500]  Well, don't drink the water.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:31.180]  You'll be fine.
[00:29:32.558 --> 00:29:35.220]  It's just unbelievable precedent-setting case.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:48.527]  And by the way, folks, yeah, they'll let you take your dogs to the convention center, and then they either shoot them or send them to a place where they might get adopted.
[00:29:51.668 --> 00:29:52.589]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.049 --> 00:29:54.670]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.570 --> 00:29:58.252]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.129 --> 00:30:08.630]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:30:08.850 --> 00:30:12.831]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:30:13.131 --> 00:30:15.291]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:30:15.631 --> 00:30:22.673]  All-natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:30:22.993 --> 00:30:25.593]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:30:25.853 --> 00:30:29.334]  My toenails now look clear, and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:30:29.634 --> 00:30:37.522]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:30:37.903 --> 00:30:39.424]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:30:39.684 --> 00:30:51.597]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[00:30:53.198 --> 00:31:05.545]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.605 --> 00:31:06.106]  are located?
[00:31:06.306 --> 00:31:09.688]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.908 --> 00:31:14.611]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:14.891 --> 00:31:19.894]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:19.994 --> 00:31:20.735]  We're good to go.
[00:31:39.813 --> 00:31:42.854]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:02.027 --> 00:32:08.392]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.613 --> 00:32:13.617]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.957 --> 00:32:21.863]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:22.023 --> 00:32:29.049]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.269 --> 00:32:30.490]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.011]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:34.071 --> 00:32:36.752]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:32:36.952 --> 00:32:43.795]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:43.915 --> 00:32:46.356]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:32:49.558 --> 00:32:50.559]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:50.619 --> 00:32:54.521]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:32:54.541 --> 00:32:56.522]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:16.428 --> 00:33:19.831]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:20.671]  We're here live.
[00:33:22.733 --> 00:33:28.498]  There's been a big new development concerning foreign troops being seen in Texas.
[00:33:30.979 --> 00:33:32.521]  And I'll tell you about that in a few minutes.
[00:33:33.281 --> 00:33:42.849]  Another friend of mine, a gentleman I've known for 10 years, 10 years, who's never fed me any bull,
[00:33:44.864 --> 00:33:49.207]  I came face to face with Dutch troops.
[00:33:51.088 --> 00:33:54.110]  So, and yes, they were at a shooting range, folks.
[00:33:54.471 --> 00:33:56.092]  He works at a shooting range.
[00:33:56.732 --> 00:33:57.232]  I go too.
[00:33:57.252 --> 00:34:02.556]  There was the Army target practicing.
[00:34:02.616 --> 00:34:03.717]  Folks, there's no end to this.
[00:34:05.018 --> 00:34:06.879]  There is just no end to this.
[00:34:09.861 --> 00:34:14.424]  And, you know, I wrote this big detailed article last Thursday about the foreign Mexican troops.
[00:34:15.933 --> 00:34:17.334]  It's about nine pages long.
[00:34:19.455 --> 00:34:21.597]  And nobody's really concerned about it or worried about it.
[00:34:21.617 --> 00:34:27.020]  You know, armed Mexican troops just driving around, and it's no big deal.
[00:34:28.221 --> 00:34:30.683]  But, oh, we can't have armed American citizens.
[00:34:32.064 --> 00:34:33.044]  We can't do that.
[00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:34.065]  Oh, that's too dangerous.
[00:34:34.105 --> 00:34:37.107]  Got to disarm them to bring in the foreign troops so we can trust them.
[00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:41.630]  All right, here's the next clip.
[00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:45.713]  Now, we played the clip from a local New Orleans station.
[00:34:47.857 --> 00:34:49.118]  Baton Rouge Station.
[00:34:49.878 --> 00:34:53.420]  Here is O'Reilly with a shorter version of the clip.
[00:34:54.841 --> 00:35:07.227]  And then notice this squeaking voice in the background about the disease is contaminated when the beach has 10% of this bacteria as we closes it.
[00:35:08.748 --> 00:35:12.330]  The difference is, ladies and gentlemen, is this is people's private property.
[00:35:13.090 --> 00:35:15.772]  Number two, when a sewer line breaks in your neighborhood...
[00:35:16.542 --> 00:35:18.483]  They don't close your neighborhood.
[00:35:18.523 --> 00:35:22.225]  They don't close a neighborhood three miles away that's high and dry.
[00:35:22.265 --> 00:35:25.567]  You know, as if sewer is going to kill you.
[00:35:25.607 --> 00:35:27.068]  You just don't drink it.
[00:35:27.448 --> 00:35:33.732]  All the time cities go, don't bathe or use the tap water for a week because there's E. coli in it.
[00:35:34.852 --> 00:35:36.113]  That's why you filter your water.
[00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:37.354]  That's why you drink bottled water.
[00:35:38.094 --> 00:35:43.477]  We don't close the cities when the sewer disease overflows these.
[00:35:44.269 --> 00:35:46.850]  But I mean, this is the attitude of the diseases.
[00:35:47.411 --> 00:35:48.812]  We've got to do it.
[00:35:49.372 --> 00:35:51.433]  So here's the disgusting neocon.
[00:35:51.973 --> 00:35:52.994]  Give us your guns.
[00:35:53.094 --> 00:35:54.234]  Open borders are good.
[00:35:55.175 --> 00:35:56.536]  Grabbing old women is good.
[00:35:56.556 --> 00:35:58.277]  O'Reilly liberal factor.
[00:35:58.317 --> 00:35:58.797]  Here it is.
[00:35:59.858 --> 00:36:02.419]  Well, I don't want you in here.
[00:36:02.439 --> 00:36:05.220]  I don't want you in here.
[00:36:05.301 --> 00:36:05.921]  Period.
[00:36:06.041 --> 00:36:06.701]  I know all about it.
[00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:06.901]  Well...
[00:36:12.628 --> 00:36:14.952]  Patricia Coney's protests were to no avail.
[00:36:15.312 --> 00:36:18.458]  They moved her out of there, and she is now out of the city.
[00:36:18.958 --> 00:36:21.442]  She's contaminated with bacteria that you and I...
[00:36:22.628 --> 00:36:28.910]  Even a tenth of what it contains, we would not be allowed to go to the beaches, let's say in South Jersey or in Long Island.
[00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:32.610]  So this is a big public health and it's very risky for everybody around.
[00:36:32.730 --> 00:36:37.131]  Yeah, but this woman, she doesn't want to leave and there's no reasoning with her.
[00:36:37.872 --> 00:36:43.773]  But what could happen if individuals stay in an atmosphere of vetted water?
[00:36:44.235 --> 00:36:47.996]  Are they going to get a disease, and will they pass that disease to others?
[00:36:48.216 --> 00:36:49.217]  Is that possible?
[00:36:49.277 --> 00:36:50.757]  Well, 100% they're going to get sick.
[00:36:50.837 --> 00:36:57.640]  I mean, if they eat or consume any water that has been contaminated, they're going to say, no, I'm going to boil my water, I'm not going to go in the water, leave me alone.
[00:36:58.040 --> 00:36:59.160]  Well, it just doesn't happen.
[00:36:59.220 --> 00:37:00.621]  I mean, the facts are the facts.
[00:37:00.701 --> 00:37:05.722]  Even if you boil the water... All right, now let's give people the facts.
[00:37:05.822 --> 00:37:09.363]  Let's give people the facts.
[00:37:09.383 --> 00:37:10.944]  20% of the city was never under water.
[00:37:12.310 --> 00:37:15.713]  As of last week, 30% isn't underwater.
[00:37:15.853 --> 00:37:22.237]  So the 10% of what was underwater, or 10% of the city that was underwater, is now dry.
[00:37:23.438 --> 00:37:26.100]  And I haven't seen the numbers, but I know it's going down even further.
[00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:30.904]  Understand, it is a, I'm going to say this again, it is a bowl.
[00:37:32.265 --> 00:37:35.887]  And the middle class areas are on the edge of the bowl.
[00:37:36.448 --> 00:37:37.829]  They were not flooded.
[00:37:38.928 --> 00:37:42.430]  They've had power now for four days.
[00:37:43.371 --> 00:37:46.653]  The water is running again, though it is fetid.
[00:37:47.853 --> 00:37:50.155]  The people are having to bathe outside.
[00:37:50.615 --> 00:37:52.416]  The people are having to sponge bath.
[00:37:52.456 --> 00:37:54.097]  They're cleaning their houses up.
[00:37:54.698 --> 00:37:56.319]  They work at local businesses.
[00:37:56.359 --> 00:38:03.563]  A lot of the houses are in perfect, immaculate shape with people swimming pooling and hot tubbing in the backyard.
[00:38:05.174 --> 00:38:06.775]  People are having barbecues.
[00:38:07.095 --> 00:38:08.536]  They're helping their neighbors.
[00:38:08.976 --> 00:38:11.077]  They're helping other people that are homeless.
[00:38:11.377 --> 00:38:14.879]  They're helping their cousin that did live in the bottom of the bowl.
[00:38:15.419 --> 00:38:18.081]  I've read articles where their cousins live on the edge of the bowl.
[00:38:18.381 --> 00:38:19.841]  Now their family's living with them.
[00:38:20.302 --> 00:38:23.643]  And by the way, you don't get to keep money.
[00:38:24.704 --> 00:38:27.405]  You don't get to keep any of your records.
[00:38:27.745 --> 00:38:28.986]  You don't get to keep anything.
[00:38:29.666 --> 00:38:34.889]  Now I have a good friend who works in security at the Austin-Berksford Airport
[00:38:36.326 --> 00:38:36.646]  Okay?
[00:38:38.107 --> 00:38:45.691]  And he said that when these people get off the planes, they take everything but the clothes on their backs and they put them in an incinerator.
[00:38:46.652 --> 00:38:50.574]  They put them in bags marked for incineration, quote, to stop typhus.
[00:38:51.074 --> 00:38:52.715]  No typhus has shown up, folks.
[00:38:53.456 --> 00:38:55.037]  So they're destroying their records.
[00:38:55.357 --> 00:38:57.018]  People who show up who have a car.
[00:38:57.742 --> 00:39:10.088]  At any of these convention centers in Austin, or San Antonio, or Houston, or Baton Rouge, they tell them, no, no aid, you give that car up, you forfeit it to us, you give your dogs up.
[00:39:10.949 --> 00:39:17.192]  In the first week of the evacuation, they broke up families just because FEMA said, that's the rule, children first.
[00:39:19.073 --> 00:39:20.534]  It's unbelievable.
[00:39:22.248 --> 00:39:24.750]  And so they make you give up your dogs and cats.
[00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:25.851]  That's been all over the news.
[00:39:26.171 --> 00:39:27.912]  So they try to twist it on this news piece.
[00:39:28.172 --> 00:39:30.434]  Well, they let her take her dogs to the convention center.
[00:39:30.814 --> 00:39:33.356]  Yeah, where the troops either shoot them in the head.
[00:39:33.376 --> 00:39:35.497]  I have the Dallas Morning News, by the way, on this.
[00:39:35.777 --> 00:39:38.159]  The police shoot them with the troops.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:47.065]  Or they send them off to one of these big SPCAs who are trying not to kill them, but they're being forced to kill them because they've got tens of thousands of them.
[00:39:48.161 --> 00:39:53.923]  And the video of this old lady's house, it's just full of food, full of water.
[00:39:53.983 --> 00:39:55.103]  She's high and dry.
[00:39:55.503 --> 00:39:56.463]  There's no reason.
[00:39:56.923 --> 00:40:07.926]  It would be better to let the piles of food, the warehouses of food, be brought into the areas that aren't underwater and let the people stay in their own houses!
[00:40:09.287 --> 00:40:11.707]  This is what we've always done in America, folks.
[00:40:11.727 --> 00:40:12.448]  They've never.
[00:40:13.048 --> 00:40:15.208]  New Orleans has flooded several times, by the way, before.
[00:40:15.629 --> 00:40:17.209]  They've never forced you to leave.
[00:40:18.931 --> 00:40:21.572]  But now you see it's the new America.
[00:40:23.032 --> 00:40:26.553]  You've got this domesticated population that knows nothing.
[00:40:29.633 --> 00:40:30.854]  Alright, I'm ranting and raving.
[00:40:30.934 --> 00:40:33.554]  It's just, I am so sick of it.
[00:40:35.335 --> 00:40:37.915]  And now they try gun confiscation all over the city.
[00:40:38.935 --> 00:40:41.576]  Going to doctors' and nurses' houses.
[00:40:42.076 --> 00:40:43.576]  And I've got the reports right here.
[00:40:43.636 --> 00:40:46.817]  There was one house with four nurses living in it.
[00:40:48.268 --> 00:40:49.149]  And they said, that's it.
[00:40:49.309 --> 00:40:49.850]  We're leaving.
[00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:54.395]  We were going to stay at the hospital, but there's no way we're going to sleep here at night without guns.
[00:40:54.695 --> 00:40:56.797]  The police didn't protect us during the rioting.
[00:40:57.058 --> 00:40:58.339]  They're not protecting us now.
[00:40:58.659 --> 00:40:59.120]  That's it.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.765]  If they get shot by somebody or they get hurt, they can just get medevaced out.
[00:41:05.094 --> 00:41:08.656]  And see, that'll make the city totally break down, totally be federalized.
[00:41:09.116 --> 00:41:11.518]  Actually, the feds are bringing down the city.
[00:41:12.018 --> 00:41:21.084]  And now the New York Times is talking about making it an island and making it a huge resort town and bringing in white sands and taking all the private property.
[00:41:21.784 --> 00:41:25.306]  Oh yes, when they're done, it's going to be a big, fat resort.
[00:41:25.887 --> 00:41:31.430]  All those poor people, all those middle class people, you watch, you're going to get a quarter on the dollar.
[00:41:32.090 --> 00:41:34.732]  It's the new London ruling, the Supreme Court ruling.
[00:41:35.746 --> 00:41:51.955]  I didn't want to believe it the first week and a half, and now Dick Cheney's proposing it, now it's in the New York Times being proposed, they're openly not going to give you your property, and the police are saying that all the records in the courthouses got destroyed of your deeds.
[00:41:53.396 --> 00:42:04.282]  Of course, the courthouses hate stories, but still, just no deeds, and that's all ruined, and it's all been contaminated with fetid water, all those papers have to be destroyed.
[00:42:05.954 --> 00:42:08.758]  I'm afraid we're going to have to take your property.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.142]  So there you have it, folks.
[00:42:12.523 --> 00:42:14.245]  Enjoy your government.
[00:42:15.927 --> 00:42:18.631]  And they're talking about now just flooding most of the city.
[00:42:19.562 --> 00:42:30.125]  And basically have canals over a lot of it and dredging it out and having a big multi-hundred billion dollar project whereas they could clean the city out and fix it for about $50 billion.
[00:42:30.205 --> 00:42:30.545]  Oh no!
[00:42:30.565 --> 00:42:45.609]  It's going to be a big pork barrel for select interests and all the big real estate commissions are behind basically leveling the city now and they'll just leave the old French Quarter be the only area they'll leave be and you're not going to get your property back.
[00:42:47.230 --> 00:42:48.950]  I didn't want to believe it and now they're announcing it.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:56.902]  And for those that doubt it, one more time, New Orleans begins confiscating firearms as water recedes.
[00:42:56.942 --> 00:43:06.105]  New York Times, water was receding across the flood-beaten city today as police officers began confiscating weapons, including legally registered firearms.
[00:43:06.806 --> 00:43:07.306]  Legally.
[00:43:07.826 --> 00:43:08.806]  From civilians.
[00:43:09.067 --> 00:43:10.367]  Notice they call us civilians.
[00:43:10.747 --> 00:43:13.088]  See, the military government calls us civilians.
[00:43:14.344 --> 00:43:18.506]  In preparation for a mass forced evacuation of the residents still living there.
[00:43:18.826 --> 00:43:26.610]  No civilians in New Orleans will be allowed to carry pistols, shotguns, or other firearms, said P. Edwin Pompous III, the superintendent of police.
[00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:28.911]  Only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons, he said.
[00:43:29.532 --> 00:43:35.895]  And the way the private corporations take over is, all over the world, in the last ten years, they've gone from
[00:43:36.795 --> 00:43:42.361]  Three-to-one police versus security guards to three-to-one security guards versus police.
[00:43:42.821 --> 00:43:53.773]  Then the government gives the security guards law enforcement powers, and they work for private interests in Blackwater and Titan and other serious merc groups.
[00:43:53.833 --> 00:43:56.296]  I mean, these are just vicious mercs.
[00:43:57.145 --> 00:43:59.367]  Are all over the city doing whatever they want.
[00:43:59.407 --> 00:44:01.168]  The cops basically bow to them.
[00:44:01.508 --> 00:44:07.412]  They're driving around in armored vehicles and black uniforms doing whatever they want.
[00:44:10.594 --> 00:44:11.455]  And here's another one.
[00:44:11.475 --> 00:44:14.497]  The NRA was first saying gun confiscation was good last week.
[00:44:14.537 --> 00:44:16.598]  Now they've been whipped by their members.
[00:44:17.859 --> 00:44:20.781]  NRA comments on gun confiscation in New Orleans.
[00:44:21.481 --> 00:44:26.865]  It appears the NRA changed their stance after receiving heat for initially supporting.
[00:44:27.762 --> 00:44:28.942]  The gun confiscation.
[00:44:28.962 --> 00:44:38.605]  Numerous media sources are reporting on a campaign by New Orleans city authorities to confiscate lawfully owned firearms from the people in the city of Louisiana.
[00:44:39.665 --> 00:44:46.387]  And it continues, statute does grant the government during a state of emergency broad powers in regulating and controlling firearms.
[00:44:47.367 --> 00:44:49.207]  Which I say those powers are illegitimate.
[00:44:49.667 --> 00:44:51.808]  However, we have seen, not just with Katrina,
[00:44:52.466 --> 00:45:01.693]  But other similar situations, that when police are unable to control the criminal element, people turn to the one freedom that protects all others, the Second Amendment.
[00:45:03.595 --> 00:45:04.856]  And that's absolutely true.
[00:45:05.016 --> 00:45:09.139]  So, kind of a wishy-washy statement from them.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:17.866]  So understand, they've said since last Wednesday, no food or water, you come out, the government is going to wage siege on you,
[00:45:19.179 --> 00:45:21.320]  Not let you drive out of your high and dry house.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:26.201]  Not let you drive on a highway that's wide open to a store ten miles away to get food.
[00:45:26.541 --> 00:45:29.082]  You're not going to keep working at your job at the power plant.
[00:45:29.422 --> 00:45:31.022]  You're not going to keep working at the hospital.
[00:45:31.463 --> 00:45:36.964]  But it admits in the New York Times and other articles that cops and others, oh, they're allowed.
[00:45:37.864 --> 00:45:39.585]  They put markers on their houses.
[00:45:39.805 --> 00:45:41.345]  Oh, that's where the God lives.
[00:45:41.445 --> 00:45:42.606]  Oh, leave the God alone.
[00:45:43.126 --> 00:45:44.786]  Leave the first class citizen alone.
[00:45:45.487 --> 00:45:47.007]  Everybody else, though, they've got to go.
[00:45:49.401 --> 00:45:50.822]  Oh, you're Blackwater Security.
[00:45:50.902 --> 00:45:51.502]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:45:51.522 --> 00:45:52.442]  You do whatever you want.
[00:45:52.462 --> 00:45:54.123]  My gosh.
[00:45:54.203 --> 00:45:54.923]  Oh, my gosh.
[00:45:55.763 --> 00:45:56.864]  Oh, you're just an old lady.
[00:45:56.884 --> 00:45:57.784]  We're going to make you leave.
[00:46:00.725 --> 00:46:03.606]  And they're setting the precedent.
[00:46:03.666 --> 00:46:08.067]  If there's a crisis or a problem or something that happens in your area, folks, you're gone.
[00:46:08.968 --> 00:46:09.508]  You're gone.
[00:46:11.108 --> 00:46:13.329]  Everything is about controlling populations.
[00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:14.890]  This was all a massive drill.
[00:46:14.910 --> 00:46:15.670]  All right.
[00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:18.131]  He calls in every day since the disaster.
[00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:18.711]  He's able to call.
[00:46:19.474 --> 00:46:20.374]  And we appreciate that.
[00:46:20.454 --> 00:46:22.395]  Charles in Louisiana gives us a quick report.
[00:46:22.735 --> 00:46:24.996]  Then we'll go to John, Jason, David, Robert, and others.
[00:46:25.776 --> 00:46:27.417]  Charles, give us your report, my friend.
[00:46:27.637 --> 00:46:31.258]  About that old lady, she was about 64, a little redhead woman with glasses.
[00:46:31.959 --> 00:46:33.339]  They threw her down on the ground.
[00:46:33.919 --> 00:46:37.301]  They burned the gun at her and handcuffed her and escorted her off.
[00:46:37.341 --> 00:46:38.401]  I don't know what happened to her.
[00:46:39.347 --> 00:46:40.608]  They just took us someplace.
[00:46:41.108 --> 00:46:43.108]  Well, there's other stuff that's been all over the news.
[00:46:43.188 --> 00:46:45.009]  I'm dragging people even older out.
[00:46:45.129 --> 00:46:45.349]  Yes.
[00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:49.271]  But anyway, there is gun confiscation, and the military is involved in it.
[00:46:50.431 --> 00:46:51.271]  The military is there.
[00:46:51.331 --> 00:46:51.772]  Oh, I know.
[00:46:51.852 --> 00:46:58.734]  I mean, Honorary just says they aren't because it's so criminal, so illegal, and so incendiary.
[00:46:58.974 --> 00:47:00.035]  People are getting really mad about it.
[00:47:00.075 --> 00:47:00.935]  Listen, listen.
[00:47:01.955 --> 00:47:06.857]  Charles, I have a friend who works at Red's Indoor Range here in Austin.
[00:47:08.170 --> 00:47:15.932]  And I went in there to shoot yesterday, and I've known this guy for actually more than 10 years.
[00:47:16.852 --> 00:47:19.113]  And he never walks over here to tell me something wild.
[00:47:19.173 --> 00:47:28.555]  He walks over, he says, Alex, there were Dutch troops from the Netherlands in here, and regular Army target shooting.
[00:47:29.991 --> 00:47:35.412]  I mean, so, there's so many of them, even where I live, they're here admitting it's for the hurricane.
[00:47:35.913 --> 00:47:37.153]  So they're armed, folks.
[00:47:37.473 --> 00:47:38.513]  The Mexicans are armed.
[00:47:38.533 --> 00:47:39.133]  Make no mistake.
[00:47:39.153 --> 00:47:39.513]  Go ahead.
[00:47:40.214 --> 00:47:50.536]  So, but what hurts me, it hurts me, the military, our military doing this, knowing it's illegal, they stand on the news, oh, we hate to do this, I'd rather do this in Iraq.
[00:47:51.416 --> 00:47:53.077]  This is George Bush's soldiers.
[00:47:53.097 --> 00:47:54.357]  This is not my army.
[00:47:54.847 --> 00:47:56.369]  The way they're treating these people.
[00:47:56.789 --> 00:47:59.271]  I mean, these houses are beautiful, Mr. Jones.
[00:47:59.532 --> 00:48:01.093]  If you see this, not touch of water.
[00:48:01.113 --> 00:48:02.875]  I'm talking about million-dollar homes.
[00:48:03.555 --> 00:48:05.077]  Beautiful paintings inside.
[00:48:05.377 --> 00:48:06.278]  They're making them leave.
[00:48:06.318 --> 00:48:07.700]  They ain't been touched by water.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:09.101]  But three levees blew up.
[00:48:09.958 --> 00:48:10.399]  Oh, I know.
[00:48:10.419 --> 00:48:10.639]  I know.
[00:48:24.858 --> 00:48:28.520]  And I need people to tape all this off the news because I can't do it all.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:34.803]  But I have the Dallas Morning News where they're driving around and just every ten seconds they're shooting dogs.
[00:48:35.003 --> 00:48:35.263]  Yes.
[00:48:35.483 --> 00:48:37.284]  And they witness troops killing dogs.
[00:48:37.324 --> 00:48:39.145]  They pull up and the troops deny it.
[00:48:39.485 --> 00:48:41.646]  And the cops admit they're killing dogs.
[00:48:41.827 --> 00:48:42.027]  Yes.
[00:48:42.227 --> 00:48:45.028]  And then on the national news, the shooting continues.
[00:48:45.508 --> 00:48:49.250]  And it's just a bunch of gang member troops and cops running around having a good time.
[00:48:49.270 --> 00:48:50.971]  It's not the 9th Ward shooting.
[00:48:50.991 --> 00:48:53.092]  Not one cop was hit by sniper fire.
[00:48:53.412 --> 00:48:54.533]  They're doing their own shootings.
[00:48:55.633 --> 00:48:56.274]  No, I know.
[00:48:56.294 --> 00:49:01.958]  They shoot, and then they hype themselves up with it.
[00:49:02.259 --> 00:49:05.181]  Look, criminals always make excuses for what they do, Charles.
[00:49:05.281 --> 00:49:18.572]  Well, Mr. Jones, what's got me discouraged, and I've got a quick moment with it, I went down here, all these people, when they come out of New Orleans, they're worried about, and this is the truth, I swear to you, they're worried about the football games down here on Sunday.
[00:49:19.617 --> 00:49:20.518]  I don't understand.
[00:49:20.538 --> 00:49:22.160]  We've got to continue the game.
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.142]  Yeah, and I went to get a guy a mattress yesterday.
[00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:27.284]  He got hooked on the television and wouldn't take his eyes off.
[00:49:27.505 --> 00:49:28.365]  I said, I'm talking to you.
[00:49:28.385 --> 00:49:29.446]  I'm trying to get your mattress.
[00:49:29.727 --> 00:49:31.328]  Yeah, I was just watching the game.
[00:49:31.709 --> 00:49:33.851]  Mr. Jones, something's wrong with these people.
[00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:35.312]  Something's wrong with me.
[00:49:35.332 --> 00:49:37.454]  I tried.
[00:49:37.474 --> 00:49:39.456]  I can't handle the people no more.
[00:49:39.516 --> 00:49:40.737]  The ignorance, the mentality.
[00:49:40.797 --> 00:49:42.839]  Well, I mean, describe this for people, though.
[00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.461]  So on your local news, it's...
[00:49:45.171 --> 00:49:50.712]  It's what we're getting an inkling of on the national news that, well, the troops hate to take it, but they've got to take your guns.
[00:49:50.792 --> 00:49:52.993]  He said, I'd rather do this in Iraq.
[00:49:53.613 --> 00:49:55.253]  I'd rather do this, and I'd hate to do it here.
[00:49:55.293 --> 00:49:59.694]  Well, we've got to support our troops, and that means giving our women and children over to them and giving them our guns.
[00:49:59.754 --> 00:50:03.135]  See the mental illness of supporting whatever the government does?
[00:50:03.815 --> 00:50:05.895]  And they're talking to these people bad down here.
[00:50:05.975 --> 00:50:08.576]  They're scaring them, threatening them not to give them water.
[00:50:09.558 --> 00:50:13.501]  Mr. Jones, this is total chaos.
[00:50:13.801 --> 00:50:15.942]  Listen, there are news articles where they go.
[00:50:16.002 --> 00:50:16.863]  The reports are.
[00:50:16.883 --> 00:50:18.283]  They're not getting them food and water.
[00:50:18.564 --> 00:50:20.285]  They announced it last Wednesday.
[00:50:20.505 --> 00:50:23.026]  The city is now under federal siege.
[00:50:23.567 --> 00:50:25.548]  Well, let me remind people of something.
[00:50:26.042 --> 00:50:30.026]  When people were trying to get food and water, Luton was in small areas.
[00:50:30.407 --> 00:50:40.497]  De Blasio wanted to put all combatant troops to shoot people for taking food and water, when her own police was stealing, and she had a statement.
[00:50:43.778 --> 00:50:46.941]  Oh, they want to engage us.
[00:50:47.001 --> 00:50:48.443]  They want to slap us around.
[00:50:48.683 --> 00:50:49.944]  They want to dominate us.
[00:50:50.024 --> 00:50:51.346]  This is about enslavement.
[00:50:51.566 --> 00:50:55.150]  This is about being ruled, being conquered, being dominated.
[00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:59.354]  They want to take the gloves off really bad, and they're getting a chance to do it in Louisiana.
[00:51:02.281 --> 00:51:05.183]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.883 --> 00:51:07.164]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.384 --> 00:51:13.127]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.387 --> 00:51:18.669]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:19.650]  Brace yourselves.
[00:51:19.810 --> 00:51:38.288]  As the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open, a nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged, witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips, troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.348 --> 00:51:40.190]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:40.931]  That's 1-888-2533-139.

[00:53:38.513 --> 00:53:39.474]  We're digging up that clip.
[00:54:09.108 --> 00:54:13.491]  From presentplanet.com over the weekend for the Dallas Morning News.
[00:54:15.312 --> 00:54:22.678]  Because now the Washington Post, Dallas Morning News, and others have gotten behind the curve, losing readers, so they've also started their own TV shows.
[00:54:24.699 --> 00:54:31.424]  And so they now send out camera crews, and they're shooting video of the police shooting dogs.
[00:54:34.168 --> 00:54:35.709]  And, I mean, there's no reason for this.
[00:54:35.830 --> 00:54:36.890]  It's, quote, humane.
[00:54:37.051 --> 00:54:39.753]  No, folks, it's because they're bored.
[00:54:40.794 --> 00:54:42.815]  These dogs aren't anywhere near starving.
[00:54:43.836 --> 00:54:47.119]  As long as the dog's got water, they can go for weeks without food.
[00:54:47.159 --> 00:54:51.222]  And, believe me, dogs will eat rats, they'll eat grass, they'll eat everything.
[00:54:52.443 --> 00:54:54.745]  And they're just shooting fat family dogs.
[00:54:55.486 --> 00:54:56.466]  No reason for this.
[00:54:57.839 --> 00:55:03.983]  But again, you've got to have the shooting to then have the sound of guns in the background and go, battles with snipers, rage.
[00:55:04.383 --> 00:55:08.465]  And then cops have to hear shots over the next hill and, we're under El Cato attack!
[00:55:08.485 --> 00:55:09.446]  We're under El Cato!
[00:55:09.646 --> 00:55:10.686]  Raid the old ladies!
[00:55:10.746 --> 00:55:11.127]  Raid them!
[00:55:11.147 --> 00:55:11.507]  Raid them!
[00:55:11.527 --> 00:55:11.947]  Raid them!
[00:55:12.347 --> 00:55:17.751]  See, that's the excuse for the gun confiscation for the news images they need to condition all of us.
[00:55:18.071 --> 00:55:19.051]  I'm not joking, folks.
[00:55:19.071 --> 00:55:19.912]  This is not a joke.
[00:55:22.393 --> 00:55:23.634]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[00:55:23.714 --> 00:55:25.435]  We'll get to your calls here in a moment.
[00:55:26.494 --> 00:55:28.415]  Just briefly, I've made 12 films.

[00:56:28.562 --> 00:56:32.084]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.

[00:57:01.030 --> 00:57:02.772]  All right, I'm moving quick to your calls now.
[00:57:03.132 --> 00:57:04.493]  John in Texas, you're on the air.
[00:57:04.533 --> 00:57:05.214]  Go ahead, John.
[00:57:08.076 --> 00:57:08.977]  John, you're on the air.
[00:57:08.997 --> 00:57:09.737]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:10.038 --> 00:57:10.218]  Hi.
[00:57:10.828 --> 00:57:19.975]  A friend of mine who I've known for 35 years, he lives in Michigan on the Canadian border, called me up the other day and said that the Canadian newscasts are saying that they're sending 7,000 armed troops to New Orleans.
[00:57:20.836 --> 00:57:25.880]  Plus that... Yeah, I mean, the big secret here is they're using armed troops.
[00:57:26.881 --> 00:57:27.801]  Armed Dutch.
[00:57:28.442 --> 00:57:29.583]  Armed Mexicans.
[00:57:30.282 --> 00:57:47.088]  And then the media will point, and it's admitted, armed NATO, armed Canadian, it's in the news that, quote, combat troops are coming, but then it'll say they're armed, or it'll say some units are armed, or some units aren't armed, and then idiots email me going, I saw the news.
[00:57:47.468 --> 00:57:51.129]  Well, those aren't armed in San Antonio with soup kitchens.
[00:57:51.569 --> 00:57:54.490]  That's one group, one convoy.
[00:57:54.510 --> 00:57:56.791]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:57:57.290 --> 00:58:07.272]  Well, I called my mother up, who lives just a little ways from the Canadian border herself, asked what she heard, and she said she heard that they were talking that Canadian forces were the first ones into New Orleans.
[00:58:07.312 --> 00:58:09.273]  They were there even before our National Guard got there.
[00:58:09.513 --> 00:58:10.733]  Well, I need Canadians.
[00:58:10.953 --> 00:58:14.614]  It's in Canadian papers that police said they saw bombs go off on the levees.
[00:58:15.454 --> 00:58:16.514]  That was in the Globe and Mail.
[00:58:16.614 --> 00:58:21.115]  We need people to get us these articles, to get us what newscast it was on.
[00:58:21.796 --> 00:58:23.116]  I can't crack it all down.
[00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:31.977]  But, I mean, I can't go to the shooting range now without talking to people who face-to-face have the Dutch troops in uniform come in.
[00:58:33.157 --> 00:58:35.238]  I mean, folks, I've been to urban warfare drills.
[00:58:35.338 --> 00:58:38.960]  It's the Dutch that are the vanguard to kick our guts out.
[00:58:41.781 --> 00:58:46.083]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.766 --> 00:58:58.406]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.066 --> 00:59:00.126]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.826 --> 00:59:01.947]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.607 --> 00:59:03.407]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.167 --> 00:59:05.088]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.748 --> 00:59:09.489]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.909 --> 00:59:12.270]  And now, live from Austin, Texas...
[00:59:13.150 --> 00:59:14.030]  Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.050 --> 00:59:18.172]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into hour number two on this live 12th day of September 2005.
[00:59:18.332 --> 00:59:20.433]  We're going to be here for the next two hours.
[00:59:20.493 --> 00:59:21.113]  Wide open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:21.153 --> 00:59:24.294]  More developments, more confirmation on foreign troops.
[00:59:42.142 --> 00:59:48.386]  They admit that German, Dutch, British, and others are in New Orleans.
[00:59:49.147 --> 00:59:51.388]  They admit Canadian troops are down there.
[00:59:51.849 --> 00:59:54.090]  We have confirmed armed Mexican troops.
[00:59:54.531 --> 00:59:57.453]  At least three different convoys were in Texas late last week.
[00:59:58.453 --> 01:00:08.200]  Dutch troops right here in South Austin, traveling through, going into the gun shops, getting prepared.
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.701]  I mean, you can't
[01:00:11.559 --> 01:00:12.980]  You can't make stuff up like this.
[01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:15.021]  This is just so out of control.
[01:00:15.962 --> 01:00:16.602]  And it's clear.
[01:00:16.682 --> 01:00:23.626]  This is a foreign troop red-dawn takeover drill or giant war game going on in New Orleans.
[01:00:25.827 --> 01:00:32.511]  Mass gun confiscation is still going on, though General Honore and others are now backing off their statements that they would confiscate guns.
[01:00:32.791 --> 01:00:34.492]  This has caused such a public outrage.
[01:00:34.532 --> 01:00:38.975]  The gun confiscation is continuing, and I don't want to, but I may have to go to New Orleans.
[01:00:41.323 --> 01:00:44.187]  I'm pretty much sure to get arrested or beat up by these people or worse.
[01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:45.349]  But c'est la vie.
[01:00:45.489 --> 01:00:47.612]  It just never ends, folks.
[01:00:47.672 --> 01:00:48.473]  It never ends.
[01:00:51.024 --> 01:01:05.368]  I've still got to go down to San Antonio and show the decoy Mexican troops, the ones that are down there with a soup kitchen, that actually could help people, that could feed 7,000 people a day, this group of a couple hundred Mexican troops that are down in San Antonio with these mobile kitchens.
[01:01:05.968 --> 01:01:08.088]  Well, they don't want them in New Orleans.
[01:01:08.609 --> 01:01:11.449]  It's a siege operation to drive them out of the city.
[01:01:11.970 --> 01:01:14.330]  No food or water, no help, just give us your guns.
[01:01:14.850 --> 01:01:16.291]  We'll get more into that right now.
[01:01:16.351 --> 01:01:17.431]  Let's just go to your calls.
[01:01:18.934 --> 01:01:21.935]  Jason in Maryland, then David, Robert, Mike, and others.
[01:01:21.975 --> 01:01:22.696]  Go ahead, Jason.
[01:01:23.536 --> 01:01:24.476]  Hi, thanks, Alex.
[01:01:24.756 --> 01:01:29.498]  A couple of pieces of information I heard on George Norrie last week.
[01:01:30.359 --> 01:01:37.121]  ExxonMobil profiting $110 million a day since Katrina.
[01:01:38.842 --> 01:01:39.602]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:01:39.622 --> 01:01:45.625]  There's nothing wrong with profits unless it's not free market and organized and an oligopoly or monopoly.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:53.424]  And the oil companies, since oil prices have doubled, and now more than doubled in the last two years, their profits have more than doubled.
[01:01:53.484 --> 01:01:58.786]  So all this stuff about shortages and refineries and boutique oils, it's a bunch of bull.
[01:01:59.407 --> 01:01:59.767]  Okay?
[01:02:00.007 --> 01:02:03.609]  They're just ripping us off, folks.
[01:02:03.749 --> 01:02:13.574]  Even more interesting, I found, was George's statement that he had a friend of his who he trusts, Carl, who is in the Army Corps of Engineers.
[01:02:14.495 --> 01:02:15.255]  He was a diver.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:22.203]  And said that the Army Corps of Engineers saw blast marks at the bottom of the dike in New Orleans.
[01:02:24.184 --> 01:02:26.325]  Well, I tell you, those things look like they were blown.
[01:02:26.365 --> 01:02:27.145]  They were big.
[01:02:27.505 --> 01:02:30.167]  You mean George says his friend called him and told him that?
[01:02:30.407 --> 01:02:31.187]  Who he trusts.
[01:02:32.828 --> 01:02:34.548]  Who is in the Army Corps of Engineers.
[01:02:34.869 --> 01:02:35.889]  Well, that's unbelievable.
[01:02:35.929 --> 01:02:44.373]  I mean, I've got... Look, the news, ABC News and others, will point at some disheveled welfare individual...
[01:02:45.467 --> 01:02:46.747]  I have a real quick question before I go.
[01:02:46.767 --> 01:02:47.528]  I have...
[01:03:12.333 --> 01:03:25.838]  Some friends who are on Social Security for various and sundry reasons, and I was wondering what your opinion was, what's going to happen to these people when everything goes down?
[01:03:27.139 --> 01:03:33.641]  Well, I'll try to comment on that after we come back, but when specifically did George say this about his friend and the bombs?
[01:03:34.161 --> 01:03:35.862]  That was either Friday or Saturday night.
[01:03:38.063 --> 01:03:38.823]  All right, well...
[01:03:40.214 --> 01:03:40.935]  That's amazing.
[01:03:41.255 --> 01:03:42.776]  That's just absolutely amazing.
[01:03:43.677 --> 01:03:45.038]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:03:45.278 --> 01:03:46.519]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.614 --> 01:03:57.476]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.716 --> 01:03:59.298]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.638 --> 01:04:04.321]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.662 --> 01:04:11.387]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:13.709]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.909 --> 01:04:16.752]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.832 --> 01:04:21.496]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.716 --> 01:04:26.140]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:33.567]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.827 --> 01:04:36.249]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:38.151]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:04:38.431 --> 01:04:44.299]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:04:44.379 --> 01:04:51.289]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:04:53.982 --> 01:04:55.583]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:55.723 --> 01:04:59.805]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:59.965 --> 01:05:02.846]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:02.927 --> 01:05:09.650]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:09.830 --> 01:05:12.832]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:13.032 --> 01:05:15.433]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:15.553 --> 01:05:23.717]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as after
[01:05:23.797 --> 01:05:25.317]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:54.342 --> 01:06:00.824]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:06:01.064 --> 01:06:05.085]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:06:05.345 --> 01:06:07.485]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:06:07.846 --> 01:06:14.887]  All-natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:06:15.187 --> 01:06:17.808]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:06:18.068 --> 01:06:21.549]  My toenails now look clear, and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:06:21.849 --> 01:06:29.756]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:06:30.117 --> 01:06:31.638]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:06:31.898 --> 01:06:37.704]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid.
[01:06:38.024 --> 01:06:43.806]  Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide.
[01:06:44.286 --> 01:06:46.587]  Or online at drugstore.com.
[01:06:46.987 --> 01:06:52.369]  Nonex Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:06:54.710 --> 01:07:00.733]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.333 --> 01:07:04.314]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:15.521 --> 01:07:17.122]  Well, this is a big revelation.
[01:07:17.682 --> 01:07:19.143]  In fact, I should have told him to hold.
[01:07:19.323 --> 01:07:21.545]  Is Jason in Maryland still there?
[01:07:22.886 --> 01:07:23.666]  Oh, he is still there.
[01:07:24.507 --> 01:07:34.473]  George Norrie, who I really respect, I mean, he's a three or four time Emmy Award winner for news productions.
[01:07:35.678 --> 01:07:37.678]  And, you know, he really separates it, too.
[01:07:37.998 --> 01:07:40.279]  He calls a lot of his shows fun.
[01:07:40.679 --> 01:07:42.299]  He's talking about Bigfoot or UFOs.
[01:07:42.339 --> 01:07:44.600]  He says this is a fun show tonight.
[01:07:45.060 --> 01:07:48.240]  Then when he has me on, he says this is a serious show tonight.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:51.121]  We're talking about really serious documented things.
[01:07:51.461 --> 01:07:58.482]  So, you know, he's really brought news and information into the show, and then he clearly separates it and says now this is the fun part.
[01:07:59.722 --> 01:08:03.083]  You know, when they talk about kind of the Twilight Zone type stuff.
[01:08:03.806 --> 01:08:04.806]  Which, that's the format.
[01:08:04.826 --> 01:08:05.546]  I'm not knocking them.
[01:08:06.887 --> 01:08:14.469]  But if the caller's right, and I don't think the caller's lying, but we haven't confirmed this yet, we've got to track it down, this is a big deal.
[01:08:15.029 --> 01:08:29.413]  Because we've got police officers, we've got juvenile justice officers, we have locals, we have firemen, we have a lot of people saying they heard explosions, saw white flashes, that the levees were blown.
[01:08:32.336 --> 01:08:47.929]  And if George Norrie, who of course was an officer in the Navy himself, if he's saying one of his good personal friends, Army Corps of Engineers, has been diving on those levees, and that they look like they were blown, that is just another huge piece of evidence.
[01:08:48.810 --> 01:08:50.692]  Huge piece of evidence.
[01:08:51.893 --> 01:08:54.115]  Let's go back to Jason.
[01:08:54.375 --> 01:08:56.777]  Jason, be specific about what George said.
[01:08:58.675 --> 01:09:16.549]  Just exactly what I said, that he had a very good friend whom he trusts in the Army Corps of Engineers, and that he had a conversation with him in which he said that they certainly looked like they were blown, that the dikes had explosion marks on them under the water where they dove.
[01:09:17.406 --> 01:09:19.326]  And I believe it was Friday or Saturday night.
[01:09:19.366 --> 01:09:22.347]  I'm sure you can find it on the Coast to Coast AM website.
[01:09:22.387 --> 01:09:23.307]  Well, I mean, think back.
[01:09:23.347 --> 01:09:24.727]  Who was he interviewing at the time?
[01:09:24.967 --> 01:09:25.647]  I don't recall.
[01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:30.308]  I'm only able to get portions of the program before it fades in and out.
[01:09:30.368 --> 01:09:35.469]  But that I heard very clearly, and I'm certain that you can find it on Friday or Saturday night's program.
[01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:36.169]  All right.
[01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:37.610]  Well, I'll certainly track it down.
[01:09:37.650 --> 01:09:38.350]  Thanks for the call.
[01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.870]  But that fits in with everything else we've been hearing and seeing.
[01:09:44.431 --> 01:09:45.671]  It's just so disgusting.
[01:09:46.992 --> 01:09:48.313]  It's just always the same.
[01:09:48.353 --> 01:09:54.138]  I mean, we caught the British government carrying out the bombings of 7-7 and the duds of 7-21.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:58.743]  In July, we have caught the U.S.
[01:09:58.763 --> 01:09:59.884]  government carrying out terror.
[01:09:59.904 --> 01:10:09.652]  You know, this has gotten so mainstream that I was in Whole Foods this weekend after I had gone to the gym.
[01:10:11.113 --> 01:10:12.695]  And I'm in Whole Foods getting some food.
[01:10:13.746 --> 01:10:22.228]  Big grocery store, and there on the magazine rack, with people snatching it and grabbing it, literally, was Adbusters, the November-December issue.
[01:10:23.868 --> 01:10:29.469]  And it's George Bush on the cover, you know, with a lady powder-puffing him, putting his makeup on.
[01:10:29.509 --> 01:10:31.470]  It says, a crack in the facade.
[01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:35.930]  And there's an article in there.
[01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:38.731]  This is a mainstream liberal magazine.
[01:10:41.284 --> 01:11:04.054]  Admitting, going over the declassified CIA documents and President Roosevelt's admissions of how our government carried out terror attacks in Egypt to blame it, not in Egypt, in Iran, they also did in Egypt, to blame it on the elected president, Mosaddegh, in 1953.
[01:11:05.635 --> 01:11:13.761]  Now, I know that, you know that, but this is one of the most under-reported things, and my point is, is that just there it is.
[01:11:13.781 --> 01:11:17.824]  It's really becoming mainstream news.
[01:11:17.844 --> 01:11:31.314]  And then the next article was about fascism in America, and the police state, and surveillance, and how dangerous genetic engineering is, and how it's the real environmental threat.
[01:11:31.374 --> 01:11:31.574]  Yeah.
[01:11:34.008 --> 01:11:35.389]  It was just blowing me away.
[01:11:35.449 --> 01:11:42.293]  Of course, the liberals weren't saying get self-sufficient to the point of going out and buying guns, though they were saying start a garden.
[01:11:44.254 --> 01:11:46.916]  I mean, none of us are going to be free until we're self-sufficient.
[01:11:47.256 --> 01:11:48.577]  We've got to have storable food.
[01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.078]  We've got to have water filters.
[01:11:50.538 --> 01:11:51.519]  We've got to have gold.
[01:11:51.579 --> 01:11:52.660]  We've got to have guns.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.741]  And we've got to have gardens, folks.
[01:11:56.682 --> 01:12:00.244]  I mean, you'd be surprised how much food you can grow in 200 square feet.
[01:12:02.472 --> 01:12:10.656]  I mean, you can grow eggplants, and you can grow cucumbers, and tomatoes, and potatoes, and onions.
[01:12:11.757 --> 01:12:23.583]  You can grow enough to sustain you throughout the summer and have enough to can some for the fall and winter out of 200 square feet.
[01:12:24.443 --> 01:12:28.525]  Out of 400 square feet in one of the better growing zones...
[01:12:30.799 --> 01:12:45.731]  You know, I'd say below something like South Dakota, you could... I don't have all the specific numbers, but I know you can grow just on an acre, on a half acre, with decent soil.
[01:12:46.132 --> 01:12:51.976]  You know how cheap an acre or a half acre is, maybe 50 miles away from a major city?
[01:12:52.797 --> 01:12:54.999]  You can have a little place, build yourself a little cabin...
[01:12:55.863 --> 01:12:56.644]  We're good to go.
[01:13:14.378 --> 01:13:16.900]  All around me, but I don't have any land myself.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:21.925]  It just takes time to go find land you want to buy and to buy it, but I sure want to do it.
[01:13:22.586 --> 01:13:34.636]  Believe me, if I had time, if I wasn't literally fighting the New World Order every millisecond of my waking life, then I would definitely have that little farm.
[01:13:36.338 --> 01:13:39.261]  I'd go out somewhere and buy myself 20 acres and build a little...
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.461]  Two-room log cabin on it.
[01:13:43.661 --> 01:13:46.302]  You can buy the kits really cheap, put the log cabin together.
[01:13:47.643 --> 01:13:51.585]  And that's where I'd be every weekend.
[01:13:51.625 --> 01:13:56.567]  But for a little bit more money, you can buy a few acres on a river and then have a water supply right there.
[01:13:56.607 --> 01:13:57.367]  Just so beautiful.
[01:13:57.888 --> 01:13:59.328]  But there's just no time.
[01:13:59.368 --> 01:14:01.149]  But I suggest you do it.
[01:14:01.609 --> 01:14:04.891]  That's how we become self-sufficient in this fight against the New World Order.
[01:14:07.330 --> 01:14:07.891]  We're good to go.
[01:14:08.131 --> 01:14:08.532]  I think?
[01:14:30.808 --> 01:14:32.369]  And that's why they're in control, folks.
[01:14:32.789 --> 01:14:38.671]  Because they are basically a virus, a cancer on the human species, the human soul.
[01:14:41.492 --> 01:14:42.372]  They're a disease.
[01:14:42.432 --> 01:14:45.593]  I mean, they don't care about destroying the body politic.
[01:14:46.053 --> 01:14:47.834]  They don't care about destroying society.
[01:14:47.854 --> 01:14:51.915]  They don't care about toxifying the bloodstream of the society.
[01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:57.137]  They just feed and feed and feed and feed and feed and feed.
[01:14:57.157 --> 01:14:58.157]  They have no conscience.
[01:14:58.598 --> 01:14:59.598]  They have no empathy.
[01:15:00.623 --> 01:15:03.125]  I mean, I am so thankful for my life.
[01:15:03.606 --> 01:15:05.127]  So thankful for my family.
[01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:07.689]  So thankful for every bit of food I eat.
[01:15:08.509 --> 01:15:11.011]  So thankful for every breath I take.
[01:15:11.612 --> 01:15:13.053]  So thankful for God.
[01:15:13.373 --> 01:15:15.595]  And so thankful for every sunset.
[01:15:15.835 --> 01:15:20.980]  And so thankful for the woods and every beautiful babbling brook.
[01:15:22.621 --> 01:15:30.187]  And every fiery sunset that shouts like a huge army
[01:15:34.224 --> 01:15:38.005]  I just cannot fathom the beauty of life.
[01:15:38.065 --> 01:15:49.628]  I cannot articulate the mystery of it and of the experience of being here and of the deep feeling of needing to leave something for those that come in the future.
[01:15:49.688 --> 01:15:52.389]  The need to build beautiful things.
[01:15:52.469 --> 01:15:58.010]  The need to attempt to articulate complex and important truths.
[01:16:00.282 --> 01:16:01.983]  And I'm not even that good of a person.
[01:16:02.343 --> 01:16:07.305]  I'm just in touch with what it is to be alive and the human experience in life itself.
[01:16:08.146 --> 01:16:21.251]  I'm an aggressive, boorish individual in many respects, an inarticulate oaf, a babbling, slothful, greedy creature in many respects.
[01:16:21.291 --> 01:16:27.394]  But at least I'm in tune and I'm in touch with the higher things in life that are the lower things in life.
[01:16:27.434 --> 01:16:29.175]  I mean, they're the most base things in life.
[01:16:30.327 --> 01:16:34.589]  The most base things in life are just family and home and self-sufficiency.
[01:16:34.649 --> 01:16:36.349]  We're meant to work in the dirt.
[01:16:36.729 --> 01:16:37.970]  We're meant to craft.
[01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:39.811]  We're meant to make things.
[01:16:39.871 --> 01:16:41.431]  We're meant to take care of children.
[01:16:41.471 --> 01:16:43.392]  We're meant to love each other.
[01:16:43.412 --> 01:16:44.972]  We're meant to take care of our elders.
[01:16:45.473 --> 01:16:47.113]  We're meant to take care of our children.
[01:16:47.393 --> 01:16:49.794]  We're meant to be in communities and be informed.
[01:16:50.134 --> 01:16:51.455]  We're meant to fight evil.
[01:16:51.675 --> 01:16:57.717]  We're meant to march out and face down criminals and beat their brains out and kick their guts out when need be.
[01:16:58.277 --> 01:16:59.558]  This is what it is to be human.
[01:17:00.917 --> 01:17:02.778]  And I look at our forefathers.
[01:17:03.658 --> 01:17:05.178]  I mean, they were made of this stuff.
[01:17:05.218 --> 01:17:06.899]  They were ready to get it on.
[01:17:07.639 --> 01:17:09.139]  They were ready to defend themselves.
[01:17:09.219 --> 01:17:10.340]  They weren't slaves.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:12.080]  They weren't going to be dominated.
[01:17:12.300 --> 01:17:13.801]  They weren't going to be subjugated.
[01:17:14.101 --> 01:17:15.721]  They weren't going to be brought under heel.
[01:17:16.281 --> 01:17:18.642]  They weren't going to be domesticated and castrated.
[01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:22.043]  And I look at us today, and it makes me sick.
[01:17:22.103 --> 01:17:23.183]  It makes me sad.
[01:17:24.424 --> 01:17:29.225]  Because we got criminally insane, bloodthirsty control freaks...
[01:17:30.362 --> 01:17:31.743]  You've got different groups.
[01:17:31.763 --> 01:17:37.146]  You've got the group that's totally cold and scientific, that is just pure evil, who just executes all this.
[01:17:37.166 --> 01:17:41.508]  And you've got a lot of their minions that enjoy the evil, enjoy the raw exercise of power.
[01:17:43.089 --> 01:17:52.374]  I mean, there are people that if it meant they could have a lot of power for 20 years, and at the end of the 20 years the earth was going to blow up, they'd do it.
[01:17:53.414 --> 01:17:54.355]  Just to have power.
[01:17:54.615 --> 01:17:55.595]  Just to have sex.
[01:17:55.996 --> 01:17:57.176]  Just to be looked up to.
[01:17:57.256 --> 01:17:58.457]  Just to be groveled to.
[01:17:59.338 --> 01:18:04.401]  And the more houses, and the more helicopters, and the more mistresses they get, the more unhappy they are.
[01:18:04.821 --> 01:18:18.689]  Because true happiness comes from being part of the species, giving unto others, do unto others as you'd have them do unto you, laying your life down for your brother, because in that type of climate, you have liberty, you have plenty, you have freedom.
[01:18:19.309 --> 01:18:24.652]  America, what, 5% of the population has half the world's wealth,
[01:18:28.718 --> 01:18:33.662]  Not because we were evil empire, because we were greedy, but because we had liberty, so we produced.
[01:18:35.284 --> 01:18:36.785]  Strong men don't care about production.
[01:18:36.805 --> 01:18:37.846]  They care about dominating.
[01:18:38.126 --> 01:18:41.449]  By that I mean king rats, dominators, dictators.
[01:18:42.510 --> 01:18:49.035]  But now we've been grabbed by these parasites, and they're using our energy source we built up to dominate the globe.
[01:18:50.296 --> 01:18:52.298]  My very fiber cries out against it.
[01:18:54.620 --> 01:18:55.921]  Here it is, folks, the 2006 Red Book.
[01:18:57.475 --> 01:18:59.900]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[01:19:00.672 --> 01:19:04.313]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.

[01:19:15.877 --> 01:19:17.398]  They are instruments of debt.

[01:21:55.002 --> 01:21:57.503]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:57.983 --> 01:22:02.244]  Did you know that the United Nations Charter outlines a path to world tyranny?
[01:22:02.824 --> 01:22:08.486]  Did you know that the United Nations is building its own army to enforce its will upon the world?
[01:22:09.046 --> 01:22:15.148]  Did you know that they've empowered themselves to cross sovereign nations' borders without consent with their armies?
[01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:15.828]  5-1-6-8-7-3-6
[01:22:34.751 --> 01:22:35.131]  Call now.
[01:22:35.151 --> 01:22:36.952]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:12.264]  The CIA and the private contractors they hire to play the part of Al-Qaeda are having trouble even finding Muslims to dress up and do it.
[01:23:12.744 --> 01:23:14.645]  You know, fat bin Ladens and the rest of them.
[01:23:14.665 --> 01:23:16.046]  Remember the fat bin Laden tape?
[01:23:16.466 --> 01:23:21.628]  They admitted later it was a fake bin Laden produced by some Western intelligence agency.
[01:23:22.508 --> 01:23:26.430]  Well, now they just have white guys with Australian and British and American accents
[01:23:27.159 --> 01:23:33.041]  And they show up, and Al-Qaeda is going to get you, because they found that's more effective to scare people.
[01:23:33.061 --> 01:23:36.722]  So we're going to play that later.
[01:23:37.162 --> 01:23:40.504]  Also, the Dallas Morning News, where they're out liberating the dogs of their lives.
[01:23:41.244 --> 01:23:50.047]  They've told them since last Wednesday, no food or water for the citizens of New Orleans that are refusing to leave in the high and dry areas for million-dollar homes, you know, down to $200,000 houses.
[01:23:50.067 --> 01:23:50.347]  Little class.
[01:23:54.073 --> 01:23:54.873]  No food and water.
[01:23:54.953 --> 01:23:57.674]  They're actually waging siege against the city.
[01:23:58.054 --> 01:24:02.095]  They've got plenty of time to go around killing dogs and dragging out old ladies.
[01:24:02.815 --> 01:24:03.895]  That's what the government does.
[01:24:03.955 --> 01:24:04.955]  They dominate you.
[01:24:04.975 --> 01:24:06.015]  They're not there to help you.
[01:24:06.596 --> 01:24:09.156]  Let's go ahead and talk to David and Mass and Robert, Mike, and others.
[01:24:09.196 --> 01:24:09.836]  Go ahead, David.
[01:24:11.277 --> 01:24:17.838]  Alex, in the midst of all the Katrina chaos, I got an article from the Times of London today.
[01:24:18.498 --> 01:24:19.418]  Very scary.
[01:24:19.578 --> 01:24:21.899]  I'm not sure if you had it posted on Infowars.
[01:24:22.119 --> 01:24:23.299]  I didn't really look, but
[01:24:23.994 --> 01:24:27.577]  It's WMD threat could spark American nuclear strike.
[01:24:27.597 --> 01:24:29.678]  Can you read a couple of paragraphs, short ones here?
[01:24:29.698 --> 01:24:33.401]  Yeah, they're saying we'll start nuking people if we think they might have WMDs.
[01:24:33.641 --> 01:24:34.341]  Yeah, listen to this.
[01:24:35.022 --> 01:24:42.507]  A president of the United States would be able to launch preemptive nuclear strikes against enemies planning to use weapons of mass destruction.
[01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:48.553]  Under a reserved nuclear operations doctrine to be signed within the next few weeks.
[01:24:48.873 --> 01:24:54.857]  And the federal government just ruled that they can secretly arrest citizens for no reason and hold you indefinitely.
[01:24:54.917 --> 01:24:58.480]  So all this important stuff is happening while we're watching Katrina.
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:02.442]  Now, listen, Alex, how come they can... I mean, listen to this wording here.
[01:25:02.823 --> 01:25:07.826]  The revised doctrine would allow preemptive strikes against states or terror groups.
[01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:10.548]  Well, I mean, you've got to be in a state if you're a group.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:15.683]  I mean, the Orwellian wording... Well, that's what the neocons said.
[01:25:15.703 --> 01:25:19.446]  Look, we have the copy, the photocopy of his handwriting.
[01:25:19.786 --> 01:25:21.707]  Rumsfeld admits it's his.
[01:25:22.348 --> 01:25:29.533]  And he says Saddam isn't a threat, but we can blame his state and others that aren't culpable with 9-11.
[01:25:29.973 --> 01:25:36.177]  And so we can attack any state that we can claim is shepherding Al-Syiatis.
[01:25:36.617 --> 01:25:36.978]  That's right.
[01:25:37.038 --> 01:25:40.120]  And on the other hand, we have, of course, thanks to the new...
[01:25:40.700 --> 01:25:44.241]  Bush surrogate son signing PDD-60.
[01:25:44.942 --> 01:25:50.884]  You know, we're supposed to absorb a nuclear strike, and they'll just, like, stand by and assess it and not do anything.
[01:25:51.224 --> 01:25:53.365]  But on the other hand, we can attack anybody.
[01:25:54.505 --> 01:26:07.650]  Well, to talk about Bush and Senior and Clinton, I watched the press conference they gave last week, and one of many, and literally Bush Senior for ten minutes sits there worshiping
[01:26:08.422 --> 01:26:09.762]  Clinton, he is the greatest.
[01:26:09.802 --> 01:26:10.583]  He is the best.
[01:26:10.983 --> 01:26:11.743]  Unlimited energy.
[01:26:11.763 --> 01:26:13.103]  I've never known someone this good.
[01:26:13.143 --> 01:26:15.044]  He is just helping all these people.
[01:26:15.084 --> 01:26:16.344]  He is absolutely incredible.
[01:26:16.464 --> 01:26:17.504]  Oh, I love you, Bill Clinton.
[01:26:18.484 --> 01:26:21.065]  There's no place for that in the middle of a disaster.
[01:26:21.325 --> 01:26:23.866]  These men just show up to worship each other.
[01:26:24.126 --> 01:26:27.106]  Then Clinton gets up there and, I just love George Sr.
[01:26:27.186 --> 01:26:28.127]  Oh, you're so good.
[01:26:28.227 --> 01:26:29.087]  Oh, you're the best.
[01:26:29.127 --> 01:26:29.987]  No, I love you.
[01:26:30.007 --> 01:26:32.288]  I mean, it's so obscene.
[01:26:32.748 --> 01:26:34.268]  I mean, imagine if I showed up.
[01:26:35.559 --> 01:26:41.021]  In New Orleans and called in on the cell phone and sent a report from New Orleans.
[01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:44.722]  Now I'm going to talk for 10 minutes about how good Alex Jones is.
[01:26:45.202 --> 01:26:47.683]  And I sat there and babbled about how great I am.
[01:26:47.963 --> 01:26:51.825]  I mean, this is just insanity right out in front of us.
[01:26:52.725 --> 01:26:58.727]  I mean, all they do is grandstand going around sucking up donations to their foundations, which they keep.
[01:26:59.587 --> 01:27:04.849]  I ask myself every day almost when I get up, how do we allow ourselves to get like this?
[01:27:05.874 --> 01:27:07.315]  I just don't understand how it got there.
[01:27:27.777 --> 01:27:32.481]  Well, understand, the government doesn't help those that want the help, the welfare crowd.
[01:27:33.021 --> 01:27:37.945]  And then on the other side, you've got people high and dry going, we're fine, I work here at the hospital.
[01:27:38.325 --> 01:27:42.168]  Get out of there right now or I'm going to use lethal force on you.
[01:27:43.108 --> 01:27:44.189]  I mean, it's pathetic.
[01:27:44.209 --> 01:27:46.531]  Totally pathetic.
[01:27:46.651 --> 01:27:47.151]  I'm shocked.
[01:27:47.311 --> 01:27:47.832]  I really am.
[01:27:47.852 --> 01:27:49.633]  I mean, how much more obvious can it be?
[01:27:49.713 --> 01:27:50.314]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:51.054 --> 01:27:57.539]  And listen, folks, I've been in gun shops, I've been at the shooting range, and some people get it, even some people at the shooting range don't get it.
[01:27:58.397 --> 01:28:00.679]  Did you know gun confiscations were going on?
[01:28:00.819 --> 01:28:01.960]  I didn't know that.
[01:28:01.980 --> 01:28:02.741]  That ain't true.
[01:28:02.821 --> 01:28:03.962]  Bush wouldn't do that.
[01:28:04.862 --> 01:28:06.904]  And then somebody else goes, oh yeah, it's true.
[01:28:06.944 --> 01:28:07.825]  It was on CNN.
[01:28:08.385 --> 01:28:09.847]  Well, maybe we need it.
[01:28:09.947 --> 01:28:13.049]  I mean, maybe them peoples is dangerous.
[01:28:13.410 --> 01:28:17.733]  No, we're not talking about them peoples that you's afraid of that's at the Superdome.
[01:28:18.173 --> 01:28:22.337]  We's just talking about folks that's living in the middle class area.
[01:28:23.167 --> 01:28:24.307]  Oh, Wheezy is?
[01:28:24.867 --> 01:28:26.088]  Well, gee whiz.
[01:28:27.428 --> 01:28:29.888]  Listen, I got to go.
[01:28:29.988 --> 01:28:32.209]  Cowboys are going to be playing in a few minutes.
[01:28:32.949 --> 01:28:37.130]  The guy actually sent this to me, and I was sitting there looking at him, and he had just dim eyes.
[01:28:37.730 --> 01:28:42.250]  Just a dim, little, emasculated... Well, he was never a man, so he couldn't be emasculated.
[01:28:44.051 --> 01:28:44.971]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.431 --> 01:28:47.071]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.951 --> 01:28:50.632]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.196 --> 01:28:57.237]  Gano CafÃ© is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[01:28:57.477 --> 01:29:03.118]  Already a number one beverage in Asia, Gano CafÃ© is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[01:29:03.418 --> 01:29:09.280]  What makes Gano CafÃ© special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[01:29:09.400 --> 01:29:15.341]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[01:29:15.421 --> 01:29:16.382]  We're good to go.
[01:29:35.481 --> 01:29:40.307]  And to meet the demands of a busy day the natural and healthy way, try Gano Cafe today.
[01:29:40.367 --> 01:29:46.895]  Visit www.healthycoffeeonline.us or call 888-784-0718.

[01:29:53.732 --> 01:30:01.998]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.238 --> 01:30:06.601]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.901 --> 01:30:15.807]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.027 --> 01:30:19.630]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.910 --> 01:30:24.940]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.260 --> 01:30:31.953]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:30:32.403 --> 01:30:32.583]  I think.
[01:30:55.077 --> 01:30:57.499]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[01:30:57.739 --> 01:31:00.542]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[01:31:00.862 --> 01:31:04.926]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[01:31:05.146 --> 01:31:14.434]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, this small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[01:31:14.734 --> 01:31:19.638]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[01:31:19.918 --> 01:31:31.047]  Loaded with Zanzones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found, fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and stress.
[01:31:31.087 --> 01:31:31.888]  So much more.
[01:31:32.108 --> 01:31:38.152]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the mangosteen with Zango, the original mangosteen functional health beverage.
[01:31:38.412 --> 01:31:42.515]  Order your Zango by calling now, 800-625-2890 or visit mangosteenmarket.com.

[01:31:43.796 --> 01:31:44.376]  Call now, 800-625-2890.
[01:31:56.764 --> 01:31:57.284]  Don't worry.
[01:31:57.744 --> 01:31:59.325]  This show is documented.
[01:31:59.785 --> 01:32:03.066]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.526 --> 01:32:05.566]  Alright, now rapid speed through your calls.
[01:32:05.606 --> 01:32:07.867]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Colorado.
[01:32:07.887 --> 01:32:08.607]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:32:08.627 --> 01:32:09.187]  You're on the air.
[01:32:09.247 --> 01:32:09.888]  Welcome.
[01:32:10.448 --> 01:32:10.728]  Thanks.
[01:32:10.988 --> 01:32:13.389]  He was never a man, so how could he be emasculated?
[01:32:13.589 --> 01:32:15.169]  Alex, tell us what you really think.
[01:32:15.489 --> 01:32:18.890]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:32:18.910 --> 01:32:19.510]  I appreciate it.
[01:32:20.851 --> 01:32:22.551]  But you kind of touched on one already.
[01:32:24.168 --> 01:32:31.653]  I was thinking that maybe the government had plans to turn New Orleans into like a resort area or something after this, not really build it back to what it used to be.
[01:32:31.673 --> 01:32:33.834]  And the scumbags are now openly talking about it.
[01:32:34.314 --> 01:32:35.335]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:35.435 --> 01:32:42.980]  Listen, I joked a week and a half ago that they'll probably give all the contracts to Halliburton, and meanwhile, while I was joking, they were giving them the contract.
[01:32:43.241 --> 01:32:45.582]  The most horrible thing you can imagine, they'll do it.
[01:32:46.423 --> 01:32:49.965]  Yeah, and there were some articles that you read saying...
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:33:04.249]  Yes, and I've seen on the news where Cheney's going, we'll make it back better and make new resort areas out of areas that were totally destroyed.
[01:33:04.989 --> 01:33:07.391]  The New York Times came out with its big plan.
[01:33:07.651 --> 01:33:13.095]  We'll tear out the center of the city and we're going to put in waterways like Venice.
[01:33:13.556 --> 01:33:15.457]  It was all there.
[01:33:15.537 --> 01:33:16.518]  Everything you can imagine.
[01:33:18.119 --> 01:33:19.020]  You ever heard of Dave
[01:33:20.132 --> 01:33:25.434]  Dobin Meyer, he's got a website called Salt, or PassTheSalt.com out of Ohio.
[01:33:26.174 --> 01:33:26.794]  No, I haven't.
[01:33:27.254 --> 01:33:29.595]  He wrote an article on News Reviews.
[01:33:30.235 --> 01:33:35.657]  He and his organization got some money together to rent some trucks and took some food and water down to New Orleans.
[01:33:36.277 --> 01:33:37.558]  And a real interesting article.
[01:33:37.598 --> 01:33:41.419]  He said he got there like two or three days before FEMA did.
[01:33:41.879 --> 01:33:46.681]  He was just saying how with a fraction of their budget, he was able to do that while they kind of
[01:33:47.574 --> 01:33:50.435]  Just took their time getting there, and they've got a billion-dollar budget, though.
[01:33:50.815 --> 01:33:51.695]  I thought that was pretty interesting.
[01:33:51.715 --> 01:33:53.456]  Well, they've got more than a billion-dollar budget.
[01:33:53.496 --> 01:33:54.216]  Thanks for the call.
[01:33:54.896 --> 01:34:06.540]  Actually, FEMA was there day one running the operation, jamming police communications, cutting communications lines, and then day two, Walmart, who I'm no fan of, but day two, Walmart was there.
[01:34:08.180 --> 01:34:13.282]  Actually, day one, that is Tuesday, which would also be day two, but day one after it hit.
[01:34:13.742 --> 01:34:16.083]  You know, it hit Monday, flooded Monday night.
[01:34:16.753 --> 01:34:22.640]  Tuesday, Walmart was there with truck after truck because they've got distribution centers, two of them right by New Orleans.
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:23.901]  It's a big port right there.
[01:34:24.522 --> 01:34:26.424]  Just food, water for everybody.
[01:34:26.624 --> 01:34:29.667]  I mean, those distribution centers supply hundreds of stores.
[01:34:30.528 --> 01:34:32.410]  And FEMA just said, no, no, no.
[01:34:34.031 --> 01:34:38.234]  And Walmart said, but you've already got people that have spent a day at the Superdome.
[01:34:38.274 --> 01:34:39.974]  They told them to go there before the hurricane hit.
[01:34:40.955 --> 01:34:41.856]  What's wrong with you?
[01:34:41.876 --> 01:34:43.196]  We need to give them this water and food.
[01:34:43.316 --> 01:34:43.897]  No, no, no.
[01:34:44.417 --> 01:34:47.439]  Well, three days later, they still weren't giving them food or water.
[01:34:47.919 --> 01:34:49.680]  Folks, that's part of the record.
[01:34:51.381 --> 01:34:54.443]  Because the social engineers knew what would happen.
[01:34:54.463 --> 01:34:55.523]  There'd be some rioting.
[01:34:55.563 --> 01:34:56.504]  There'd be some looting.
[01:34:57.287 --> 01:35:01.188]  To make it point the cameras at it and say, see, we've got to take all your rights away.
[01:35:01.788 --> 01:35:03.049]  The city's destroyed.
[01:35:03.069 --> 01:35:04.669]  We've got to lock it down forever.
[01:35:05.249 --> 01:35:06.190]  We've got to take it.
[01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:09.991]  This is all just practice for the whole country.
[01:35:10.951 --> 01:35:12.651]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Arizona.
[01:35:12.691 --> 01:35:13.292]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:35:13.592 --> 01:35:14.352]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:35:14.572 --> 01:35:14.932]  Hi.
[01:35:15.352 --> 01:35:17.873]  My call kind of segues from the previous caller.
[01:35:18.413 --> 01:35:24.715]  I had heard that Donald Trump, and this I just heard from a fellow who keeps closer track of this stuff than I do,
[01:35:25.582 --> 01:35:31.446]  That Donald Trump had already staked out some of the property down there over, you know, right on top of residential areas.
[01:35:32.747 --> 01:35:33.908]  Have you heard anything about him?
[01:35:35.048 --> 01:35:54.481]  No, I have heard a report on NPR that all the big real estate people, three days after it hit, met in Baton Rouge and were designing and making deals and looking at rebuilding the city and making some of it be waterways and building new hotels in the Ninth Ward and
[01:35:54.941 --> 01:35:57.463]  How they'd remake the city and make it better, i.e.
[01:35:57.503 --> 01:35:58.224]  steal property.
[01:35:58.584 --> 01:36:03.048]  Then I heard Cheney was saying we can make it better and build some hotels.
[01:36:03.448 --> 01:36:14.076]  And then the New York Times had an article over the weekend, in fact it's somewhere in the stack, saying make it an island and make it all a big resort basically and don't let the people move back in.
[01:36:14.096 --> 01:36:14.897]  Yeah.
[01:36:15.598 --> 01:36:23.084]  You know, I faxed copies of the articles by Morgan Reynolds, the chief economist for Bush 1.
[01:36:24.036 --> 01:36:35.640]  And also an article by Paul Craig Roberts, impeach Bush, you know, to every congressman in my state, every Republican congressman.
[01:36:36.121 --> 01:36:48.125]  And I said, you know, if you guys don't take care of this situation and hold this man accountable, the Republican Party is going to go the way of the Whig Party into the dustbin of history.
[01:36:49.949 --> 01:36:53.071]  And I urge all other Republicans to do the same thing.
[01:36:53.111 --> 01:36:58.493]  They need to, if nothing else, be concerned a little bit about their own self-interest.
[01:36:58.833 --> 01:37:01.795]  Well, Mike, you've seen the masterful manipulation, though.
[01:37:02.415 --> 01:37:10.439]  Notice how Jesse Jackson, day one, comes out and starts screaming, you hate black people, Bush, which is obviously patently ridiculous.
[01:37:10.459 --> 01:37:13.141]  The globalists didn't do this because they hate black people.
[01:37:13.161 --> 01:37:15.662]  They did it because they hate free people, period.
[01:37:16.383 --> 01:37:21.728]  And because they wanted FEMA to have the major role in all of this, they sabotage other agencies.
[01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:38.184]  But then that's so absurd, it makes Bush look good, then it makes people draw their battle lines accordingly, like shirts versus skins, Republicans versus Democrats, or Cowboys versus the Eagles.
[01:37:38.954 --> 01:37:43.276]  And so by doing this now, it's the governor's fault, that dumb Democrat.
[01:37:43.336 --> 01:37:44.856]  No, it's that evil Republican's fault.
[01:37:45.316 --> 01:37:53.059]  Drawing it along political lines, those are actually two pillars of this corrupt system when they hold up the same group.
[01:37:53.919 --> 01:38:01.802]  And, I mean, do you want to comment on that, Mike, how they tried to make it a political left-right issue when it's just the government itself is totally criminal?
[01:38:02.455 --> 01:38:03.156]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:38:03.236 --> 01:38:09.440]  It's a clever piece of thought control, which they've gotten very good at from Bernays' time on.
[01:38:11.421 --> 01:38:22.889]  By the way, did you know it was Edward Bernays who was instrumental with the father of nuclear testing on civilian populations who actually helped write up the PR plan to put fluoride in the water?
[01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:25.910]  Just a side issue.
[01:38:25.931 --> 01:38:28.072]  I mean, that's how evil these people are, folks.
[01:38:28.112 --> 01:38:28.492]  Yeah, right.
[01:38:28.512 --> 01:38:29.753]  They don't hate black people.
[01:38:29.793 --> 01:38:31.214]  They hate everyone now.
[01:38:31.724 --> 01:38:32.985]  They're equal opportunity haters.
[01:38:34.806 --> 01:38:41.390]  But, you know, they can't take over the city government in New Orleans and then turn around and say, well, it's the mayor's fault.
[01:38:42.091 --> 01:38:45.333]  You know, they get the credit or the blame, as the case may be.
[01:38:46.034 --> 01:38:51.497]  But once they've taken over and then shove everyone else out of the way, they can't say, well, it's these people's fault.
[01:38:51.737 --> 01:38:55.680]  Mike, have we become desensitized because nobody's calling in about Mexican troops?
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:39:00.303]  I've now confirmed Dutch troops in Austin coming through at the local shooting range.
[01:39:00.908 --> 01:39:03.228]  And I've talked to one of the employees I've known for over 10 years.
[01:39:03.769 --> 01:39:06.369]  I've known him actually about 14 years, folks.
[01:39:06.389 --> 01:39:07.089]  I mean, that long.
[01:39:07.849 --> 01:39:15.471]  And then on top of it, we have open gun confiscation going on in front of everyone in middle-class neighborhoods.
[01:39:16.331 --> 01:39:19.971]  And the city is under siege.
[01:39:20.311 --> 01:39:25.632]  The feds say no food or water for anybody that wants to stay in their homes.
[01:39:25.692 --> 01:39:29.453]  And if you try to leave in your car to go get supplies, we're going to arrest you.
[01:39:30.453 --> 01:39:38.082]  Yeah, well, that goes back to Henry Kissinger's dictum that if you want to control nations, you control the oil.
[01:39:38.162 --> 01:39:40.965]  If you want to control people, you control their food and water.
[01:39:41.305 --> 01:39:45.070]  And for those that doubt that, in 1997, the UN said that at a UN food conference.
[01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:46.732]  Yeah.
[01:39:46.752 --> 01:39:48.634]  These people are just beyond contempt.
[01:39:50.221 --> 01:39:51.322]  I mean, think about this, folks.
[01:39:51.342 --> 01:40:04.907]  They write white papers that are published in public where they say they want to reduce our population, they want to forcibly sterilize us, they want to use food as a weapon, they want to get us in compact cities where we're not self-sufficient.
[01:40:05.267 --> 01:40:11.089]  I mean, they openly say they want you dependent on them so they can do bad things to you.
[01:40:11.709 --> 01:40:12.069]  Okay?
[01:40:12.289 --> 01:40:15.690]  The government openly says it, but they know 99.9% of you
[01:40:18.061 --> 01:40:23.987]  Don't know the first thing about population control, but you know all about the football games.
[01:40:24.287 --> 01:40:27.550]  You know when some adult walks up to me and goes, Hey, did you see the game?
[01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:28.951]  I want to puke on them.
[01:40:29.712 --> 01:40:35.477]  Not because I think football's bad or watching a game's bad, but our society's going down the tubes.
[01:40:35.838 --> 01:40:36.919]  We've aborted 48 million babies.
[01:40:38.641 --> 01:40:40.903]  They've got cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:40:41.244 --> 01:40:42.625]  Our borders are wide open.
[01:40:42.725 --> 01:40:50.032]  And these men think it's manly to talk about football with me, simulated combat warfare.
[01:40:50.372 --> 01:40:52.194]  Because men are supposed to talk about war.
[01:40:52.515 --> 01:40:54.637]  Men are supposed to talk about fighting for their families.
[01:40:54.937 --> 01:40:56.278]  That's what we're designed to do.
[01:40:57.099 --> 01:40:58.520]  One of our primary functions.
[01:40:59.381 --> 01:41:00.983]  And so they've created this disease warp.
[01:41:04.252 --> 01:41:13.914]  Shunting or avenue to put that manly energy into eating pizza, drinking beer, and watching simulated combat.
[01:41:14.274 --> 01:41:15.855]  That is not what men do.
[01:41:16.755 --> 01:41:29.057]  Nobody, do not walk up to me, do not walk up to me and tell me about the football game because it is like shining silverware on the Titanic going down.
[01:41:29.398 --> 01:41:31.438]  Get your priorities straight, and I tell you,
[01:41:33.001 --> 01:41:43.651]  Last hour, Charles called in, Mike, and he talked about how he's helping flood victims, and they just want to sit there on a mattress like zombies watching a football game when their life is destroyed.
[01:41:43.991 --> 01:41:45.312]  I'd be out getting a job.
[01:41:45.593 --> 01:41:47.154]  I'd be out taking care of my family.
[01:41:47.815 --> 01:41:48.836]  I'm sick of these people.
[01:41:51.278 --> 01:41:52.339]  You mentioned the Mexican troops.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:54.080]  Whatever happened to them?
[01:41:54.120 --> 01:41:54.801]  Where did they go?
[01:41:55.061 --> 01:41:55.642]  We don't know.
[01:41:56.554 --> 01:42:05.266]  We know that the different AP and Reuters articles admit that there are between two and six groups, different articles say different things, roving all over the place.
[01:42:05.647 --> 01:42:10.093]  The one group the media details is that Old Kelly, now Kelly USA,
[01:42:11.957 --> 01:42:22.381]  An office park military base down in San Antonio, they have like a bunch, what is it, six different food kitchens that'll feed 7,000 people a day.
[01:42:22.761 --> 01:42:24.241]  Did they send the Mexicans there?
[01:42:24.681 --> 01:42:25.322]  No!
[01:42:25.422 --> 01:42:29.183]  They're at San Antonio feeding people at a Red Cross office park.
[01:42:29.503 --> 01:42:31.284]  I guess the Red Cross doesn't have to spend any money.
[01:42:31.864 --> 01:42:35.185]  Meanwhile, other groups, they admit there's other convoys across the border.
[01:42:35.525 --> 01:42:37.866]  They've been reported by people I know personally
[01:42:38.566 --> 01:42:44.572]  Multiple individuals before I reported on it told me the exact same thing, 50 miles apart on the route.
[01:42:44.812 --> 01:42:46.714]  They were going north towards Dallas.
[01:42:47.214 --> 01:42:47.975]  I call the Army.
[01:42:48.015 --> 01:42:49.617]  They go, well, maybe they're in Dallas.
[01:42:49.657 --> 01:42:50.537]  Maybe they're in Houston.
[01:42:50.818 --> 01:42:52.159]  We don't know where they're going.
[01:42:52.219 --> 01:42:53.500]  That's even in the AP.
[01:42:54.381 --> 01:42:55.922]  And then I go, I better go.
[01:42:55.942 --> 01:42:57.484]  I haven't been shooting in a few months.
[01:42:57.524 --> 01:42:58.725]  I'll just take an hour off.
[01:43:00.089 --> 01:43:00.889]  We're good to go.
[01:43:20.942 --> 01:43:21.583]  And I go, really?
[01:43:21.643 --> 01:43:24.024]  Yeah, an armed army, regular army.
[01:43:24.284 --> 01:43:25.825]  We're in here sighting in their rifles.
[01:43:26.466 --> 01:43:28.027]  And I mean, I've known this guy for years.
[01:43:28.107 --> 01:43:29.287]  I mean, like 14 years.
[01:43:29.348 --> 01:43:29.988]  I said 10.
[01:43:30.408 --> 01:43:30.528]  It's 14.
[01:43:31.069 --> 01:43:33.410]  So, you know, I'm living in the twilight zone, brother.
[01:43:34.471 --> 01:43:38.273]  Well, they may have rethought the use of those Mexican troops in New Orleans.
[01:43:39.094 --> 01:43:44.157]  They may have decided they have a big enough PR disaster on their hands without further exacerbating it.
[01:43:44.377 --> 01:43:48.440]  Well, they admit NATO forces, Canadian troops, Mexican troops...
[01:43:49.239 --> 01:43:51.300]  They admit Mexican troops have landed.
[01:43:51.340 --> 01:43:57.623]  It says Mexican Marines are there, quote, helping in the disaster relief in three cities.
[01:43:57.923 --> 01:43:59.924]  I've got the article here.
[01:44:00.204 --> 01:44:01.625]  They're not in New Orleans itself.
[01:44:02.225 --> 01:44:03.785]  They're in three other coastal cities.
[01:44:03.805 --> 01:44:04.726]  They're in the ship channel.
[01:44:05.746 --> 01:44:08.868]  But I'll tell you this.
[01:44:09.068 --> 01:44:10.829]  This whole thing, Mike, is a drill.
[01:44:12.049 --> 01:44:12.509]  Yeah.
[01:44:12.829 --> 01:44:13.910]  They had Mike Brown in there.
[01:44:14.446 --> 01:44:15.527]  Jones, the same guy who represented McVeigh?
[01:44:15.547 --> 01:44:15.647]  Yes.
[01:44:15.667 --> 01:44:15.967]  Interesting.
[01:44:15.987 --> 01:44:16.047]  Hmm.
[01:44:39.875 --> 01:44:41.336]  Alright, I appreciate the call.
[01:44:41.917 --> 01:44:42.818]  Take care, my friend.
[01:44:42.858 --> 01:45:02.135]  If I'm ranting and raving, folks, again, you go and scream and expend your tribal warfare energies on football, simulated masculine behavior, simulated ritualistic warfare, ritualized warfare, gladiatorial diversions.
[01:45:05.652 --> 01:45:11.194]  And I expend my energy on real war, real information war against a real threat.
[01:45:13.515 --> 01:45:16.736]  So again, it's like these churches.
[01:45:16.776 --> 01:45:29.880]  These churches are a box to take your love of Christ, to take your spirituality, to take it and then to put it into something false and to give you all these false systems that man has created and to get you away from the Bible.
[01:45:30.563 --> 01:45:32.644]  Well, it's just like these sports stadiums.
[01:45:32.804 --> 01:45:33.624]  The Romans learned it.
[01:45:34.065 --> 01:45:40.427]  Are there to take your tribal warfare energies and expend them and control them and challenge them.
[01:45:42.188 --> 01:45:43.869]  You know, the propaganda is getting really good.
[01:45:43.909 --> 01:45:53.773]  I was watching TV late Saturday night after I got home from editing and I was watching a news channel and they had this Marine Corps ad.
[01:45:55.126 --> 01:45:58.547]  And it shows a young Hispanic, an old black man, and an older white guy.
[01:45:58.608 --> 01:45:59.788]  They're all firefighters.
[01:46:00.228 --> 01:46:01.529]  And they're driving to a fire.
[01:46:01.869 --> 01:46:06.191]  And the old white guy goes, We need people that will work together, that are part of a team.
[01:46:06.211 --> 01:46:09.052]  We've got to see that you're willing to be part of the team first.
[01:46:09.092 --> 01:46:10.152]  We all count on each other.
[01:46:11.173 --> 01:46:12.293]  Do you understand what I'm saying?
[01:46:12.313 --> 01:46:13.574]  Do you know what I mean?
[01:46:14.269 --> 01:46:22.113]  And then he flashed the Hispanic young man flashbacks to this, climbing up this mountain obstacle and being hauled up by all these comrades.
[01:46:22.573 --> 01:46:34.499]  You know, this simulated combat, which were all meant to have these rites of passages, that were all meant to be part of this, but they take it and they squander it and they misdirect it.
[01:46:35.146 --> 01:46:45.528]  And so there they are equating the Marines with firefighters, who were some of the last public servants who I salute, who they're now trying to turn into tattletales and police and spies.
[01:46:46.989 --> 01:46:48.649]  And they associate it with the Marines.
[01:46:48.769 --> 01:46:50.889]  It certainly has an illustrious history.
[01:46:51.890 --> 01:47:02.192]  But there's nothing illustrious about going and enslaving a bunch of Iraqis and being injected with experimental vaccines and breathing depleted uranium.
[01:47:06.144 --> 01:47:10.145]  There's nothing illustrious about being put in a war that's not designed to be won.
[01:47:12.005 --> 01:47:16.646]  I was talking to a former Marine Corps officer, pretty high level this weekend, friend of mine.
[01:47:16.666 --> 01:47:18.266]  He said, Alex, it's obvious.
[01:47:18.286 --> 01:47:20.087]  They keep a commander in there four months.
[01:47:20.927 --> 01:47:24.388]  We could go in there and fix things, but they don't want a strong government.
[01:47:24.868 --> 01:47:27.428]  They don't want that country free and to leave it.
[01:47:27.628 --> 01:47:28.889]  They want to keep it in turmoil.
[01:47:29.749 --> 01:47:32.289]  And I said, did you get that from me?
[01:47:32.329 --> 01:47:34.070]  He goes, no, that's what's going on.
[01:47:34.450 --> 01:47:35.670]  I was like, well, I'm glad you agree.
[01:47:36.559 --> 01:47:39.782]  And I go, have you heard of P2OG, which is the Pentagon plan to do that?
[01:47:39.802 --> 01:47:40.482]  And he goes, no.
[01:47:40.502 --> 01:47:42.884]  Well, I go, that's what the plan says.
[01:47:43.865 --> 01:47:45.346]  Do they get more weapons sales?
[01:47:45.406 --> 01:47:51.091]  Do they get to use Iraq as a permanent base if we went in there in three days and got the food and water back on and fixed things?
[01:47:51.631 --> 01:47:51.932]  No.
[01:47:53.073 --> 01:47:53.953]  No, they don't.
[01:47:54.554 --> 01:47:55.675]  Everybody comes home.
[01:47:55.975 --> 01:47:56.956]  It is a big victory.
[01:47:57.975 --> 01:47:59.556]  That's not what's meant to happen.
[01:47:59.796 --> 01:48:04.058]  That's why it was 13 years of sanctions.
[01:48:04.598 --> 01:48:07.659]  That was to keep Iraq balkanized and broken down.
[01:48:09.100 --> 01:48:17.243]  And when Saddam wouldn't go along with the sanctions anymore and started circumventing them, the globalists had to go in.
[01:48:19.404 --> 01:48:21.205]  It's meant to keep it in bedlam.
[01:48:21.854 --> 01:48:24.176]  They wouldn't let the Coast Guard help anybody.
[01:48:46.696 --> 01:48:50.720]  They had to have that image for four or five days of starving, dying people.
[01:48:51.220 --> 01:48:56.404]  So now they're going to get five times the funding, unlimited police state power, which they already had.
[01:48:56.725 --> 01:48:58.026]  Now it legitimizes that.
[01:48:58.686 --> 01:49:00.788]  Now that city's going to become federalized.
[01:49:01.068 --> 01:49:02.490]  Now it's never going to emerge.
[01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:05.452]  Now the globalists are going to get to steal all that private property.
[01:49:05.993 --> 01:49:08.515]  They have waged war against those people.
[01:49:10.817 --> 01:49:12.158]  You understand how this works?
[01:49:13.283 --> 01:49:17.366]  The bigger the war on drugs gets, the more drugs are on our streets.
[01:49:17.806 --> 01:49:25.091]  The more your kids use it, the more checkpoints, then your children get sent to a private prison, openly owned by the drug cartels.
[01:49:25.771 --> 01:49:31.715]  The government brings the drugs in, your kids use it, they put them in prison, working for the drug dealers.
[01:49:32.076 --> 01:49:33.296]  Do you understand that?
[01:49:34.137 --> 01:49:38.620]  The bigger the war on illiteracy gets, the more illiterate we get.
[01:49:39.347 --> 01:49:41.832]  It's designed for control.
[01:49:42.393 --> 01:49:44.597]  These wars aren't against you.
[01:49:44.617 --> 01:49:47.082]  Do you understand?
[01:49:47.122 --> 01:49:48.885]  We'll come back with more of your calls.
[01:49:48.925 --> 01:49:50.949]  Got a bunch of audio clips and a bunch of news.
[01:49:54.791 --> 01:50:02.160]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.441 --> 01:50:07.187]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.407 --> 01:50:13.054]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.274 --> 01:50:17.798]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:18.038 --> 01:50:25.185]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.205 --> 01:50:29.749]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.909 --> 01:50:32.391]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:32.631 --> 01:50:39.396]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:50:39.596 --> 01:50:44.860]  Order online now at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:45.280]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:54.517 --> 01:50:57.520]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.860 --> 01:51:06.688]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:07.008 --> 01:51:11.692]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.152 --> 01:51:18.878]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.279 --> 01:51:31.049]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.529 --> 01:51:35.991]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:36.151 --> 01:51:38.491]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:38.511 --> 01:51:40.452]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:40.472 --> 01:51:41.733]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:41.753 --> 01:51:43.213]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:43.233 --> 01:51:44.433]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:55.205 --> 01:52:01.148]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.368 --> 01:52:03.629]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.810 --> 01:52:10.173]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:10.513 --> 01:52:11.153]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.762 --> 01:52:31.242]  We're good to go.
[01:52:31.342 --> 01:52:31.623]  I think?
[01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:11.273]  We've got four different audio clips coming up that I want to talk about.
[01:53:12.533 --> 01:53:13.654]  The levees being blown.
[01:53:14.035 --> 01:53:15.335]  More and more reports of that.
[01:53:16.636 --> 01:53:17.757]  Shooting people's dogs.
[01:53:18.398 --> 01:53:21.540]  And also this new Al-Qaeda, these white guys in turbans.
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:25.783]  I mean, the CIA can't even find Arabs now to pose as terrorists.
[01:53:27.424 --> 01:53:28.925]  They're trying new angles on us.
[01:53:30.126 --> 01:53:31.527]  That is coming up.
[01:53:32.617 --> 01:53:37.220]  But the police are at least having to back off on the surface, saying, oh, we're not going to confiscate your guns now.
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:39.922]  We're not going to force you to leave for now.
[01:53:40.682 --> 01:53:42.143]  But then they continue to do it.
[01:53:42.883 --> 01:53:44.945]  That's because it's backfired on them politically.
[01:53:45.045 --> 01:53:48.347]  But again, they're always pushing the envelope, always testing.
[01:53:49.688 --> 01:53:51.589]  You want my new film, Martial Law?
[01:53:52.585 --> 01:54:12.212]  9-11, Rise of the Police State, or American Dictators, or Road to Tyranny, or Masters of Terror, or any of the great videos I produce, or any of the other books and videos that we carry, go to our online video and bookstore and get the films at infowars.com or prisonplanet.com via the safe, secure shopping cart.

[01:54:19.170 --> 01:54:21.331]  Decide which special you want to take advantage of.
[01:54:21.351 --> 01:54:24.132]  That's InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:54:24.572 --> 01:54:29.034]  Or call toll-free to get the films 1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:29.054 --> 01:54:38.159]  And remember, your purchase of these videos and books makes this broadcast possible, but they're also excellent films.
[01:54:38.879 --> 01:54:41.620]  I carry a lot of titles by wonderful researchers.
[01:54:41.680 --> 01:54:43.361]  Just go check it out today.
[01:54:44.111 --> 01:54:48.412]  Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:54:48.612 --> 01:54:52.493]  And never forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:53.133 --> 01:55:05.156]  Fifteen cents a day, all my videos, my weekly TV reports, e-books, my best audio interviews, fifteen cents a day, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:05.836 --> 01:55:10.337]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:55:11.778 --> 01:55:13.279]  Let's talk to Joe in Maryland.
[01:55:13.319 --> 01:55:13.979]  Go ahead, Joe.
[01:55:13.999 --> 01:55:16.341]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[01:55:16.441 --> 01:55:17.021]  Thanks for calling.
[01:55:17.582 --> 01:55:28.129]  I am so outraged with what's going on down in New Orleans with the clips that you played earlier, you know, with the little lady and this kind of thing.
[01:55:28.749 --> 01:55:29.730]  It's just outrageous.
[01:55:29.970 --> 01:55:31.191]  And this is not America.
[01:55:31.231 --> 01:55:36.814]  And I tell everybody, I said, I can't watch TV on it because I went through Hurricane Andrew.
[01:55:36.834 --> 01:55:39.756]  It took 10 years for them to say it was a Category 5.
[01:55:39.816 --> 01:55:40.657]  So I was
[01:55:41.587 --> 01:55:42.548]  Too many flashbacks.
[01:55:43.308 --> 01:55:47.471]  And Andrew, as bad as it was, it's nothing with what's going on over there.
[01:55:48.051 --> 01:55:51.414]  When the military came in to help us, they helped us.
[01:55:51.634 --> 01:55:56.737]  They didn't knock us around or say, you've got to get out of your home.
[01:55:57.318 --> 01:56:00.600]  Now, this is 13 years ago, coincidence, 13 days.
[01:56:00.680 --> 01:56:07.524]  I mean, 13 years and one day later, this happened in Florida and then New Orleans.
[01:56:08.045 --> 01:56:09.246]  But here's what I called for.
[01:56:10.635 --> 01:56:12.376]  I'm just, you know, I'm just really upset.
[01:56:13.896 --> 01:56:20.479]  In the Daily Times Saturday, there was an article in the paper, and it's from the AP.
[01:56:20.959 --> 01:56:22.920]  It said, simulation predicted.
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:26.202]  Now, here we go, the simulation again.
[01:56:26.602 --> 01:56:27.642]  Predicted 61,290 deaths.
[01:56:27.722 --> 01:56:31.604]  And then it says, Katrina roared a few days before, you know,
[01:56:38.208 --> 01:56:46.153]  I guess it was en route there, but they were doing the simulation, and the source came from Federal Emergency Management Agency.
[01:56:46.693 --> 01:56:50.876]  Four days before Katrina hit, NORTHCOM was activated and they were ready to go.
[01:56:51.777 --> 01:56:55.319]  Right, but it says a few days this simulation was made.
[01:56:55.379 --> 01:57:05.065]  It didn't tell how many days ahead of Katrina, but they even had, as Katrina roared into the Gulf of Mexico, emergency planners poured over maps
[01:57:05.416 --> 01:57:20.246]  ...and chart of a hurricane simulation that projected 61,290 dead, 384,000 injured, and in a catastrophic flood that would leave swaths of southeast Louisiana uninhabitable for more than a year.
[01:57:21.006 --> 01:57:24.849]  These planners were not involved in the frantic preparation for Katrina.
[01:57:24.929 --> 01:57:32.734]  By coincidence, hello, they were working on a year-long project to prepare federal and state officials for Category 2...
[01:57:33.692 --> 01:57:37.574]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.594 --> 01:57:38.734]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.774 --> 01:57:39.254]  Big Brother.
[01:57:39.434 --> 01:57:40.315]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:40.355 --> 01:57:42.675]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.096 --> 01:57:47.737]  You want answers?
[01:57:48.077 --> 01:57:49.098]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.825 --> 01:58:01.807]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.988 --> 01:58:06.110]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.230 --> 01:58:18.157]  The corrupt elements that control our government desperately want to set a precedent to use military force against us and to confiscate our firearms.
[01:58:19.458 --> 01:58:22.019]  They've been doing that viciously in New Orleans.
[01:58:23.760 --> 01:58:24.621]  They've been engaging...
[01:58:25.962 --> 01:58:28.905]  In these activities all over Louisiana and Mississippi.
[01:58:28.925 --> 01:58:32.327]  And now it's been all over the news.
[01:58:33.488 --> 01:58:35.330]  Waging war against the city.
[01:58:36.831 --> 01:58:39.473]  Waging siege against the city.
[01:58:41.175 --> 01:58:44.878]  Not letting food or water in to all the people that refuse to leave.
[01:58:44.898 --> 01:58:50.122]  Katrina, police won't force holdouts removal.
[01:58:50.714 --> 01:58:59.739]  With President Bush arriving in the region on Sunday, New Orleans police said they will not force holdouts to leave their homes despite a mandatory evacuation order.
[01:59:01.420 --> 01:59:12.086]  Captain Marlon DeFillo said authorities will continue to go house to house informing residents that they are in violation of mandatory evacuation orders, but we will not physically force them out of their homes.
[01:59:12.846 --> 01:59:13.987]  But then that's what they're doing.
[01:59:14.691 --> 01:59:22.537]  Also Sunday, the general leading the military's relief effort said Hurricane Katrina's New Orleans death toll will be a heck of a lot lower than officials had feared.
[01:59:23.898 --> 01:59:27.280]  The feds have been saying 10,000, but right now it's only a couple hundred.
[01:59:27.660 --> 01:59:28.361]  Thank God.
[01:59:28.581 --> 01:59:30.022]  I'm sure it's higher than that, but not 10,000.
[01:59:30.062 --> 01:59:39.709]  We're going to be taking your calls throughout this hour, and I wanted to go back later to this article from about a year and a half ago.
[01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:47.681]  It's a groundbreaking court decision that legal experts say will affect everyone.
[01:59:48.242 --> 01:59:54.003]  Police officers in Louisiana no longer need a search warrant or arrest warrant to conduct a brief search of your home or business.
[01:59:55.143 --> 01:59:55.603]  Wow!
[01:59:55.643 --> 01:59:56.964]  Just give yourselves that power.
[01:59:57.324 --> 02:00:00.625]  And now they're using it, so we'll cover that as well.
[02:00:00.885 --> 02:00:02.265]  Who's up first in order here?
[02:00:04.826 --> 02:00:05.726]  Nick in Brooklyn.
[02:00:05.746 --> 02:00:06.366]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:00:07.126 --> 02:00:08.387]  Alex Jones, how are you?
[02:00:08.587 --> 02:00:08.967]  Good, Nick.
[02:00:09.844 --> 02:00:19.466]  I just want to tell you, this is my first time calling, and ever since I started listening to you six months ago, I just want to tell you that in times of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[02:00:20.087 --> 02:00:23.307]  You're a beacon for the American spirit and the spirit of freedom.
[02:00:24.048 --> 02:00:37.571]  And I'll tell you, I saw your documentary, Martial Law, Rise of the Police State, and, you know, I usually don't, like, go along with these conspiracy theory ideas, but ever since 9-11, in Brooklyn, New York, in New York City, and the surrounding boroughs,
[02:00:38.251 --> 02:00:45.734]  I have now seen the Fuji film NYPD Blimp at least half a dozen times, flying directly over my house.
[02:00:46.774 --> 02:00:54.137]  And every day, we are besieged by helicopters, flying routine patterns, daily and nightly, every day.
[02:00:55.177 --> 02:00:57.318]  And this never happened before 9-11.
[02:00:58.139 --> 02:01:00.119]  And it has nothing to do with fighting terror.
[02:01:00.159 --> 02:01:01.500]  It's all about control.
[02:01:02.240 --> 02:01:02.920]  Absolutely.
[02:01:03.181 --> 02:01:03.761]  Absolutely.
[02:01:04.141 --> 02:01:06.842]  I have a BA in political science from a state university.
[02:01:07.492 --> 02:01:14.696]  But it took your show and your research actually for me to understand exactly what is going on in the world.
[02:01:15.637 --> 02:01:19.799]  I have now learned that Democrats, Republicans, it's all a joke.
[02:01:20.139 --> 02:01:21.440]  It's all just one big game.
[02:01:23.881 --> 02:01:24.822]  One big game.
[02:01:24.862 --> 02:01:25.842]  That's a good way of putting it.
[02:01:26.423 --> 02:01:27.423]  It is, absolutely.
[02:01:27.483 --> 02:01:31.626]  But the real reason I wanted to call you was because a couple of hours ago I was watching CNN.
[02:01:31.686 --> 02:01:32.246]  They're doing the...
[02:01:32.896 --> 02:01:34.636]  Robert's Senate confirmation hearings?
[02:01:34.856 --> 02:01:35.217]  Yes.
[02:01:35.517 --> 02:01:41.778]  And something that absolutely caught my attention was when Senator Joe Biden was speaking, was questioning Robert.
[02:01:42.418 --> 02:01:51.820]  He told him specifically that during his tenure, well, Biden was concited to the fact that Bob was going to get the Chief Justice position regardless of his decision.
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:59.962]  But what he said was that in Robert's term, in his judicial term, he will preside over decisions such as
[02:02:00.538 --> 02:02:14.287]  Implantation of microscopic tracking devices, the microchip is what we're talking about, in people and the trade-off between liberty and security and tracking and control.
[02:02:14.587 --> 02:02:18.210]  I've got to have that footage.
[02:02:18.590 --> 02:02:19.791]  What time was this today?
[02:02:20.932 --> 02:02:22.793]  Roughly anywhere between 12.45 and 1.30 p.m.
[02:02:22.813 --> 02:02:23.293]  Was it live?
[02:02:26.624 --> 02:02:27.345]  It was live.
[02:02:27.425 --> 02:02:30.689]  It was on CNN and Fox News simultaneously.
[02:02:30.749 --> 02:02:33.072]  Somebody's got to send me that video clip.
[02:02:33.112 --> 02:02:33.492]  Stay there.
[02:02:33.552 --> 02:02:35.054]  Tell folks the details about this.
[02:02:35.074 --> 02:02:36.796]  Let me get mine.
[02:02:37.197 --> 02:02:40.040]  Must have your chip when you're with Al Qaeda.
[02:02:46.886 --> 02:02:49.747]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.987 --> 02:02:51.567]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.908 --> 02:02:56.589]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.929 --> 02:03:01.351]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.771 --> 02:03:05.952]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.172 --> 02:03:09.013]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.093 --> 02:03:13.774]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.954 --> 02:03:18.375]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.615 --> 02:03:25.837]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.077 --> 02:03:28.497]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.678 --> 02:03:30.398]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:46.115 --> 02:03:47.697]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:48.097 --> 02:03:53.843]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:03:54.083 --> 02:03:59.229]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:03:59.569 --> 02:04:08.839]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:04:09.199 --> 02:04:14.143]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:04:14.463 --> 02:04:18.486]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:04:18.686 --> 02:04:23.410]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:04:23.810 --> 02:04:29.715]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:04:30.055 --> 02:04:36.285]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:04:37.387 --> 02:04:38.269]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:46.668 --> 02:04:49.030]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:49.290 --> 02:04:53.133]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:04:53.453 --> 02:04:54.273]  Read the labels.
[02:04:54.694 --> 02:04:58.816]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:59.037 --> 02:05:03.239]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:08.483]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:08.863 --> 02:05:12.405]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:05:12.625 --> 02:05:17.967]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:05:18.247 --> 02:05:20.968]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:05:21.268 --> 02:05:22.168]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:05:45.676 --> 02:05:47.877]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.437 --> 02:05:51.298]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.079 --> 02:05:56.800]  There can be no doubt about it.
[02:05:58.320 --> 02:05:59.120]  No doubt about it.
[02:06:00.781 --> 02:06:01.381]  The Pentagon.
[02:06:02.461 --> 02:06:18.974]  The federal government that's owned and controlled by private international interest are openly pushing for the forced implantation of the people of the world, not just America, with tracker chips.
[02:06:21.115 --> 02:06:31.163]  They're also pushing for the regular, routine, forced injection of the population of whatever they want, whenever they want, including vaccines that create
[02:06:32.017 --> 02:06:40.262]  Protein plaques in the brain to block certain quote illegal electrochemical interactions.
[02:06:42.523 --> 02:06:56.251]  They almost passed a law last year in England to forcibly inject every child in England with an anti-opiate drug that would block opium, heroin, and also would block
[02:06:56.900 --> 02:07:02.682]  The receptors, the electrochemical receptors in the brain for nicotine.
[02:07:03.303 --> 02:07:05.484]  Oh, well it'll stop you from using drugs.
[02:07:06.264 --> 02:07:10.926]  What it'll do is stop the brain being able to receive endorphins.
[02:07:11.726 --> 02:07:25.272]  Because the same receptors that pick up nicotine and heroin and cocaine, that was listed as well, are the same receptors that when you get a date with that really good looking nice girl you've been wanting to date for a year,
[02:07:26.059 --> 02:07:27.220]  You feel euphoric.
[02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:36.966]  Or when you do the right thing and help that little old lady across the street, or when you change that tire for that family, for that woman and her children.
[02:07:38.767 --> 02:07:45.432]  God's design is in us that we get a little reward when we do something good for ourselves, good for the species.
[02:07:47.213 --> 02:07:47.593]  No more.
[02:07:48.760 --> 02:07:50.481]  And it was in the big university papers.
[02:07:50.541 --> 02:07:51.822]  Well, it's a fair trade-off.
[02:07:52.082 --> 02:07:55.845]  Sure, it'll affect endorphins, but we have drugs that'll then treat that.
[02:07:56.745 --> 02:07:56.865]  Ah!
[02:07:58.706 --> 02:08:00.227]  So we're already in the twilight zone.
[02:08:00.247 --> 02:08:01.688]  We're already in Back to the Future.
[02:08:01.728 --> 02:08:03.409]  We're in science fiction land right now.
[02:08:04.450 --> 02:08:14.917]  Now, I remember in 2000, January 6, 2000, the Army War College got mad because the Federation of American Scientists got one of their declassified documents and published it.
[02:08:17.066 --> 02:08:18.868]  And one was called Hive Mind.
[02:08:18.908 --> 02:08:21.270]  The other was called Implantable Brain Chips by 2025.
[02:08:21.591 --> 02:08:28.137]  And it said the military's main role will be putting us in our control pods.
[02:08:29.799 --> 02:08:31.420]  By the way, folks, I know I talk about this.
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:32.261]  You don't want to believe me.
[02:08:32.541 --> 02:08:33.702]  It's mainstream news, okay?
[02:08:35.324 --> 02:08:35.885]  Mainstream news.
[02:08:36.605 --> 02:08:39.068]  And then it'll be placing us all in our own pods.
[02:08:40.294 --> 02:08:42.495]  We'll all be hooked into wires to our brain.
[02:08:43.055 --> 02:08:46.997]  And see, stuff like the Matrix actually comes from what the government's planning.
[02:08:47.397 --> 02:08:48.638]  I know you don't want to believe it.
[02:08:48.678 --> 02:08:48.978]  Fine.
[02:08:49.058 --> 02:08:49.238]  Okay.
[02:08:49.538 --> 02:08:57.202]  The government says they're going to put you in pods, and they're going to hook all this into your brain.
[02:08:57.242 --> 02:08:59.823]  But see, now we see what they're doing in 2005.
[02:09:00.844 --> 02:09:04.966]  Tommy Thompson is now traveling the country, former Health and Human Services.
[02:09:05.306 --> 02:09:07.087]  We're about to go to the caller who was mentioning this.
[02:09:09.148 --> 02:09:09.348]  Nick.
[02:09:10.220 --> 02:09:23.750]  Now traveling, and he goes to the middle schools and elementary schools, and all the kids get called in first period, or at lunch, into the auditorium, and Tommy Thompson arrives, and he walks up in a suit, and he says, Hi!
[02:09:24.571 --> 02:09:27.073]  I'm here from Verichip, the Get Chip program today.
[02:09:27.353 --> 02:09:29.275]  We've got the Chipmobile out in the parking lot.
[02:09:29.375 --> 02:09:30.616]  Folks, I have the transcripts of this.
[02:09:31.416 --> 02:09:32.557]  Everybody needs a chip.
[02:09:32.577 --> 02:09:34.679]  This is going to keep you safe from kidnappers, terrorists.
[02:09:35.239 --> 02:09:35.880]  I have one.
[02:09:35.900 --> 02:09:36.140]  Now see,
[02:09:36.847 --> 02:09:38.288]  Imagine the bizarreness.
[02:09:38.348 --> 02:09:43.371]  And I have on video Sean Hannity going, every child in America needs a chip on Fox News.
[02:09:43.691 --> 02:09:44.531]  Man, I want one.
[02:09:44.571 --> 02:09:45.812]  Man, I'm investing in this.
[02:09:46.312 --> 02:09:47.373]  Man, this is great.
[02:09:49.354 --> 02:09:50.375]  They got the CEO on.
[02:09:50.395 --> 02:09:51.515]  Well, thanks, Sean.
[02:09:51.915 --> 02:09:53.016]  Thanks, Sean.
[02:09:53.276 --> 02:09:56.238]  Well, we'll talk to you about getting it done, Sean.
[02:09:57.559 --> 02:09:59.099]  And so that's on there.
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:03.742]  And so two years ago, my cousin shows up.
[02:10:04.509 --> 02:10:09.736]  He says, yeah, over 100 officers, we got told we're all getting chips in the next two years.
[02:10:10.197 --> 02:10:11.499]  I haven't talked to him lately.
[02:10:11.519 --> 02:10:12.160]  I need to talk to him.
[02:10:12.460 --> 02:10:13.421]  Two years has passed.
[02:10:14.122 --> 02:10:18.548]  And all over, chips, chips, chips, chips, chips, chips, chips, chips, chips, chips, chips.
[02:10:18.828 --> 02:10:20.551]  We all need chips, chips, chips, chips.
[02:10:21.207 --> 02:10:27.469]  And then, and I'm sure it's true, I don't doubt it, I'm used to this, it's a full press about how we all need chips.
[02:10:27.509 --> 02:10:28.929]  You're a kook if you're against the chips.
[02:10:29.329 --> 02:10:33.030]  Andy Rooney says we all need a chip to prove we're good people.
[02:10:33.551 --> 02:10:36.671]  To prove we're not with the terrorists, is a quote.
[02:10:38.972 --> 02:10:40.012]  See, full press.
[02:10:40.713 --> 02:10:45.574]  And we're a nation that doesn't have a moral compass, so if the mainstream media says it, it must be good.
[02:10:47.885 --> 02:11:03.590]  Going back to Nick in Brooklyn, New York, now I want the specific, what you were watching, what he said, what specifically, think back to what time, exactly what Senator Biden said to Roberts during confirmation hearings.
[02:11:03.630 --> 02:11:05.070]  Tell us exactly what you heard.
[02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:10.632]  We're going to fight like devils to find this video, but please tell us about it.
[02:11:11.072 --> 02:11:14.793]  Okay, well, possibly an hour ago, I'm sitting there watching CNN,
[02:11:15.695 --> 02:11:18.516]  And from what I understand, it's Senator Biden's turn to speak.
[02:11:18.636 --> 02:11:24.157]  And he goes over the Supreme Court historic moments and decisions that held true to the Constitution.
[02:11:24.617 --> 02:11:28.378]  Those that weren't so true to the Constitution then later overturned.
[02:11:28.718 --> 02:11:30.418]  And in the spirit of the Constitution.
[02:11:30.858 --> 02:11:34.699]  And he was pretty much telling Robert, please, we know you're going to get the job.
[02:11:35.159 --> 02:11:36.800]  Please don't screw it up even further.
[02:11:36.820 --> 02:11:41.901]  We need a Chief Justice who goes by the Constitution and doesn't toe the political line.
[02:11:42.641 --> 02:11:42.741]  And
[02:11:43.257 --> 02:11:56.247]  He pretty much told them that during his judicial term, they will discuss openly, because it's already being discussed openly right now, but he will rule on implantable microchips.
[02:11:56.708 --> 02:12:00.411]  I think the phrase he used was microscopic implantations.
[02:12:01.005 --> 02:12:03.567]  In a universal implantation of all humans.
[02:12:03.907 --> 02:12:05.228]  Again, universal.
[02:12:05.268 --> 02:12:07.010]  He would rule on forced.
[02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:08.691]  On forced.
[02:12:09.232 --> 02:12:09.732]  Exactly.
[02:12:10.172 --> 02:12:10.713]  You know what?
[02:12:10.993 --> 02:12:12.334]  Instant message, my webmasters.
[02:12:12.354 --> 02:12:13.815]  We can get the transcript of that.
[02:12:13.835 --> 02:12:15.076]  It'll be up in the next few hours.
[02:12:15.396 --> 02:12:17.778]  We need to get a major report out on this.
[02:12:18.279 --> 02:12:19.399]  This is very important.
[02:12:19.419 --> 02:12:19.780]  Go ahead.
[02:12:20.427 --> 02:12:28.856]  You gotta understand, I wasn't even, I was watching him in one eye open, but in my other eye open, once I heard implantable microchips being discussed on national television.
[02:12:29.177 --> 02:12:32.300]  Well, they do all the time, but what's important is the force.
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:36.665]  Remember, the Mexican Attorney General made his employees take it.
[02:12:37.065 --> 02:12:38.607]  We're already here, folks.
[02:12:38.687 --> 02:12:39.428]  It's not coming.
[02:12:39.888 --> 02:12:40.389]  It's here.
[02:12:41.016 --> 02:12:41.436]  Oh, right.
[02:12:41.716 --> 02:12:43.276]  Did you hear about those reports?
[02:12:43.316 --> 02:12:48.297]  I think it's Barcelona, Spain, I think, where they're using the same marketing strategy as high class.
[02:12:48.317 --> 02:12:53.498]  Yeah, if you want to get in with the topless dancers in the pleasure area, you've got to have the ship.
[02:12:53.879 --> 02:13:01.480]  And again, I said six, seven years ago, they're going to use fad, they're going to use pleasure, they're going to use convenience, they're going to use elitism.
[02:13:01.860 --> 02:13:06.301]  I saw a lady with a Mercedes with pleasure, thumb scanning to get in it.
[02:13:06.921 --> 02:13:07.743]  You know, the other day.
[02:13:08.223 --> 02:13:10.727]  That's what this is all about now.
[02:13:11.488 --> 02:13:12.329]  It's just so sick.
[02:13:13.158 --> 02:13:14.319]  Alex, let me ask you a question.
[02:13:14.359 --> 02:13:14.919]  Well, you know what?
[02:13:14.959 --> 02:13:20.683]  C-SPAN will re-air this tonight, and I'm going to be editing tonight, and what happens is I get tired, I get burnout.
[02:13:21.223 --> 02:13:23.064]  Somebody tape this for me.
[02:13:23.805 --> 02:13:26.426]  You say you were watching what time Eastern?
[02:13:26.446 --> 02:13:28.027]  Give me Eastern time.
[02:13:28.047 --> 02:13:29.628]  I mean, was this an hour and a half ago?
[02:13:29.688 --> 02:13:30.409]  How long ago was this?
[02:13:31.369 --> 02:13:32.170]  Anywhere between 12.45 p.m.
[02:13:32.310 --> 02:13:37.033]  Eastern and 1.30-ish Eastern.
[02:13:37.113 --> 02:13:38.274]  You don't know.
[02:13:38.294 --> 02:13:40.415]  I mean, how long after did you call me?
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:46.125]  I immediately went online to Infowars.com looking for your radio call number.
[02:13:46.145 --> 02:13:47.506]  I actually couldn't find it.
[02:13:47.886 --> 02:13:49.788]  So we're talking about an hour ago?
[02:13:50.289 --> 02:13:52.991]  Yeah, approximately you've got an hour time frame that you're looking at.
[02:13:53.131 --> 02:13:54.953]  So you're talking about after 1 Eastern?
[02:13:56.274 --> 02:13:58.957]  Yeah, around that time schedule.
[02:13:59.177 --> 02:14:01.319]  It's whenever Biden starts questioning him.
[02:14:02.009 --> 02:14:02.249]  Right.
[02:14:02.910 --> 02:14:06.932]  And again, when we get the clip, and when we say it's bad, we'll be the weirdos.
[02:14:07.072 --> 02:14:09.294]  Oh, they don't want forced implantation.
[02:14:09.754 --> 02:14:10.715]  They're evil.
[02:14:11.295 --> 02:14:13.476]  Listen, I appreciate you calling in about this.
[02:14:14.197 --> 02:14:14.897]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:14.917 --> 02:14:15.418]  Good job.
[02:14:17.919 --> 02:14:20.341]  I've got Andy Rooney saying we should all be forced to take it.
[02:14:21.081 --> 02:14:21.722]  Straight-faced.
[02:14:22.702 --> 02:14:24.624]  I've got Tommy Thompson.
[02:14:25.504 --> 02:14:27.105]  I've got the Mexican Attorney General.
[02:14:28.726 --> 02:14:30.267]  This is not a joke, folks.
[02:14:30.347 --> 02:14:31.208]  I mean, my cousin...
[02:14:32.020 --> 02:14:38.703]  Came to my house almost two years ago and said, look, we were told within two years, he's been in the Army for like 18 years, folks.
[02:14:39.584 --> 02:14:41.865]  We were told we're all getting chips, all the officers.
[02:14:43.145 --> 02:14:45.606]  And he said, I can't tell you anymore, it's classified.
[02:14:46.047 --> 02:14:50.929]  And now he hadn't called me back and hadn't told me, he won't talk about it, he's probably gotten the chip.
[02:14:51.049 --> 02:14:52.509]  I know some special forces have.
[02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:55.451]  We're in so much trouble!
[02:14:56.423 --> 02:15:00.525]  The border's wide open, but Biden's talking about forced implantation?
[02:15:00.985 --> 02:15:03.846]  Oh, I forgot to ask him how Roberts responded.
[02:15:05.687 --> 02:15:07.148]  I'm sure Roberts didn't respond.
[02:15:07.168 --> 02:15:07.888]  Did you see this?
[02:15:07.928 --> 02:15:08.629]  Did you hear this?
[02:15:11.130 --> 02:15:11.770]  Heaven help us.
[02:15:13.111 --> 02:15:18.013]  If you saw it, too, write your eyewitness reports of it and what you took away from it.
[02:15:18.153 --> 02:15:20.634]  Email it to tips at infowars.com.
[02:15:20.674 --> 02:15:21.414]  We'll get it posted.
[02:15:21.975 --> 02:15:23.755]  I mean, I can't track it all anymore, folks.
[02:15:23.815 --> 02:15:25.056]  It's just too much is happening.
[02:15:26.168 --> 02:15:27.910]  Let's go to Robert in Tennessee.
[02:15:27.930 --> 02:15:28.590]  Go ahead, Robert.
[02:15:29.191 --> 02:15:29.631]  Hi, Alex.
[02:15:29.691 --> 02:15:33.274]  I was watching a news report also this morning.
[02:15:33.735 --> 02:15:35.556]  It was a female reporter.
[02:15:36.217 --> 02:15:37.358]  By the way, I'm from Tennessee.
[02:15:37.738 --> 02:15:46.025]  She said she was very upset there in New Orleans by seeing so many plain-clothed security people carrying big guns.
[02:15:46.566 --> 02:15:50.449]  And she said, who and why are they here and who's hiring them?
[02:15:50.993 --> 02:15:56.817]  And also, do you think that enough people may have taken up arms to keep from being removed from their homes?
[02:15:56.877 --> 02:16:00.700]  Well, that's really backfired on them.
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:06.284]  The gun confiscations over the weekend backfired, so now they're telling you they're not attacking.
[02:16:06.325 --> 02:16:08.066]  Look, it's classic military strategy.
[02:16:08.566 --> 02:16:10.488]  They're saying they're not taking guns now.
[02:16:10.888 --> 02:16:12.229]  They're saying they've stopped.
[02:16:14.275 --> 02:16:14.375]  Yes.
[02:16:14.395 --> 02:16:16.837]  Yeah, but they don't want to start another wounded knee.
[02:16:17.057 --> 02:16:17.537]  You know, seems like...
[02:16:32.651 --> 02:16:35.814]  Well, they want to test their troops, test their police.
[02:16:36.334 --> 02:16:37.556]  They have hardened grips.
[02:16:38.076 --> 02:16:39.638]  This is all for the rest of the country.
[02:16:40.018 --> 02:16:42.280]  So, see, when they do it nationwide, we won't be so upset.
[02:16:42.680 --> 02:16:46.124]  You know, Alex, I don't know if you're aware of this, but you probably are.
[02:16:46.164 --> 02:16:47.105]  You're a pretty smart fellow.
[02:16:48.526 --> 02:16:53.070]  All this stuff that's been taking place in the last few years, you remember Wounded Knee in 1973, right?
[02:16:55.427 --> 02:16:59.989]  This is where all these strategies they use now, where they first start using them.
[02:17:00.029 --> 02:17:03.691]  You know, they had F-14s or F-16s flying over that little white church.
[02:17:03.991 --> 02:17:05.531]  They were going to dump napalm on it.
[02:17:05.551 --> 02:17:06.312]  Are you aware of that?
[02:17:06.772 --> 02:17:07.212]  Oh, yes.
[02:17:08.112 --> 02:17:08.933]  Most people aren't.
[02:17:09.353 --> 02:17:18.477]  And just about everything they are doing today to the white people and black people of this country was tested out there in that desert when, didn't he?
[02:17:20.046 --> 02:17:22.947]  Unfortunately, that's where they started a lot of this.
[02:17:22.987 --> 02:17:26.008]  Well, I mean, they used bioweapons on the Native Americans.
[02:17:26.068 --> 02:17:27.368]  That's in their own handbooks.
[02:17:27.608 --> 02:17:29.869]  Yeah, they had the military there, the FBI.
[02:17:29.889 --> 02:17:31.929]  They had all sorts of people there, Alex.
[02:17:32.390 --> 02:17:35.770]  Well, I'm talking about, you know, hundreds of years ago.
[02:17:36.171 --> 02:17:38.371]  150 years ago, too.
[02:17:38.411 --> 02:17:39.051]  No, good points.
[02:17:39.151 --> 02:17:40.572]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:17:40.592 --> 02:17:40.912]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.845 --> 02:17:50.346]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon.
[02:17:50.646 --> 02:17:52.006]  A hot dog was a nickel.
[02:17:52.246 --> 02:17:54.787]  And a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[02:17:55.327 --> 02:17:56.647]  What happened to those prices?
[02:17:57.187 --> 02:17:58.887]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[02:18:00.468 --> 02:18:06.449]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[02:18:06.889 --> 02:18:07.429]  The result?
[02:18:07.869 --> 02:18:09.149]  Inflation was born.
[02:18:09.629 --> 02:18:11.710]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[02:18:13.690 --> 02:18:14.170]  We're good to go.
[02:18:38.861 --> 02:18:41.189]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now.

[02:19:09.582 --> 02:19:13.685]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[02:19:13.885 --> 02:19:16.027]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:19:16.187 --> 02:19:18.049]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[02:20:47.392 --> 02:20:48.496]  Here it is, folks.

[02:21:51.638 --> 02:21:52.819]  Seek and ye shall find.
[02:21:53.700 --> 02:21:56.661]  He's sending me the video clip so I can put it on the website tomorrow.
[02:21:56.681 --> 02:21:58.582]  He's going to overnight it to me.
[02:21:59.643 --> 02:22:06.026]  We really appreciate that, but we've still got to keep seeking it out so we can get it on the web as soon as possible.
[02:22:07.146 --> 02:22:08.887]  We're talking to Eric in Tennessee.
[02:22:09.888 --> 02:22:11.269]  We're going to Eric right now.
[02:22:12.669 --> 02:22:17.732]  And Eric, you were watching Senator Biden question
[02:22:19.241 --> 02:22:26.488]  The new Chief Justice nominee, Roberts, bringing up forced implantation.
[02:22:26.608 --> 02:22:35.295]  Now, again, Andy Rooney has called for forcing the public to take chips to, quote, prove we're good people or to tell who the good people are.
[02:22:35.776 --> 02:22:38.218]  The Mexican Attorney General has made his employees take it.
[02:22:38.518 --> 02:22:40.960]  The Army is talking about making us all take chips.
[02:22:40.981 --> 02:22:42.982]  I mean, this is in their official report in 2000.
[02:22:44.862 --> 02:22:48.124]  Now, you were watching this.
[02:22:48.144 --> 02:22:49.345]  We're getting calls about this.
[02:22:49.685 --> 02:22:54.789]  Before you play the clip, I mean, what did it make you think when you saw this come out of Biden's mouth?
[02:22:57.090 --> 02:23:01.112]  What they're doing right now, when this part came up, this is on CNN I got.
[02:23:01.773 --> 02:23:05.495]  Basically, the senators were talking to him, and he wasn't responding.
[02:23:05.535 --> 02:23:06.436]  He was just nodding.
[02:23:06.736 --> 02:23:11.339]  And Senator Biden said, going into the 21st century, these are the news.
[02:23:11.869 --> 02:23:12.869]  Folks, this is not a joke.
[02:23:12.889 --> 02:23:15.871]  And after a few suitcase nukes, they're going to be pushing this
[02:23:37.845 --> 02:23:39.066]  This is not a joke.
[02:23:39.166 --> 02:23:43.188]  They are trying to warp and mold our consciousness to accept this.
[02:23:44.108 --> 02:23:47.430]  And the Army says this is going to be their main job in the future.
[02:23:47.490 --> 02:23:50.251]  It's not just under the skin, but in your brain.
[02:23:50.932 --> 02:23:52.533]  And that's in my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[02:23:52.793 --> 02:23:54.754]  It's on the website, Infowars.com.
[02:23:55.034 --> 02:23:56.795]  But here is the clip.
[02:23:56.815 --> 02:23:58.896]  Go ahead and roll it for us, Eric.
[02:23:59.136 --> 02:24:00.477]  Okay, we'll do that, Alex.
[02:24:00.717 --> 02:24:01.137]  Thank you, sir.
[02:24:03.072 --> 02:24:18.285]  Judge, I need to know whether you will be a justice who believes that the constitutional journey must continue to speak to these consequential decisions, or that we've gone far enough in protecting against government intrusion into our autonomy, into those personal decisions we make.
[02:24:19.245 --> 02:24:21.187]  Judge, that's why this is a critical moment.
[02:24:21.727 --> 02:24:32.056]  There are elected officials in this government, such as Mr. DeLay, a fine, honorable, patriotic man, and others, who have been unsuccessful in implementing their agenda in the elected branches,
[02:24:32.910 --> 02:24:42.076]  So they've now poured their energies, as the left would if it were different, they've now poured their energies and resources into trying to change the court's view of the Constitution.
[02:24:42.976 --> 02:24:55.063]  And now they have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to fill in the two Supreme Court vacancies, one of which is chief, and the other is for associate justice, the first time in 75 years.
[02:24:56.758 --> 02:25:03.604]  Judge, I believe in every fiber of my being that their view of the Constitution and where the country should be taken would be disaster for our people.
[02:25:04.064 --> 02:25:07.868]  Like most Americans, I believe the Constitution recognizes the general right to privacy.
[02:25:07.908 --> 02:25:11.731]  I believe a woman's right to be nationally and vigorously protected exists.
[02:25:11.831 --> 02:25:17.316]  I believe that the federal government must act as a shield to protect the powerless against the economic interests of this country.
[02:25:17.636 --> 02:25:20.358]  And I believe the federal government... Hold on just a second.
[02:25:20.398 --> 02:25:21.799]  Here it is right here.
[02:25:23.991 --> 02:25:28.033]  You dismissed the Constitutional Protection of Privacy as, quote, a so-called right.
[02:25:28.593 --> 02:25:35.056]  You derided agencies like the Security Exchange Commission that combat corporate misconduct as constitutional anomalies, quote.
[02:25:35.676 --> 02:25:40.758]  And you dismissed gender discrimination as, quote, and I quote, merely a perceived problem.
[02:25:41.778 --> 02:25:46.200]  This is your chance, Judge, to explain what you meant by what you have said and what you have written.
[02:25:46.220 --> 02:25:47.801]  That's what I said when I was chairman.
[02:25:50.722 --> 02:25:52.403]  One democratic moment.
[02:25:53.862 --> 02:26:02.868]  All right, we're going to put him on hold, and we're going to find the actual clip, and we're going to play it when we come back.
[02:26:03.548 --> 02:26:03.889]  All right?
[02:26:05.230 --> 02:26:19.238]  I mean, I let listeners do this, and I always appreciate it, but sometimes it's not actually queued up where they thought it was, and we need to get it specifically queued up, because we're getting a bunch of calls about this on and off air, about him saying this about the implantable chip.
[02:26:19.278 --> 02:26:21.800]  So we're going to find specifically...
[02:26:22.768 --> 02:26:29.271]  Where that clip is, just about 30 seconds before, and then we're going to come back and we're going to play it.
[02:26:30.352 --> 02:26:35.834]  Because it's obvious we've got some attempts to fast forward or rewind it there while we're waiting.
[02:26:36.254 --> 02:26:37.275]  I'm sorry about the audio.
[02:26:37.295 --> 02:26:38.475]  He's going to mail me a copy.
[02:26:38.495 --> 02:26:40.476]  As soon as I get it, we'll put it up on the web.
[02:26:41.257 --> 02:26:47.559]  If my staff feels so inclined, they can go into C-SPAN, which will have much of the hearings up later.
[02:26:47.599 --> 02:26:50.741]  You can watch it online and maybe grab the clip out there.
[02:26:51.845 --> 02:26:54.669]  But regardless, that won't be a very high-quality clip.
[02:26:55.049 --> 02:26:57.672]  It'll be better when I get a copy on VHS.
[02:26:57.712 --> 02:27:04.841]  So we'll come back, and then I've also got three or four other clips I want to play of other things that are very important and cover some news.
[02:27:04.881 --> 02:27:08.385]  I may have to just stop taking calls after Eric because we're almost out of time.
[02:27:08.785 --> 02:27:09.786]  We've got about 30 minutes left.
[02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:16.222]  The websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and Infowars.net.
[02:27:16.642 --> 02:27:17.483]  They're excellent sites.
[02:27:17.543 --> 02:27:20.244]  Be sure and check them out on a daily basis.
[02:27:20.804 --> 02:27:23.625]  All right, we'll be right back on the other side of this quick break.
[02:27:24.045 --> 02:27:25.006]  Keep it locked in.
[02:27:36.170 --> 02:27:37.110]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.570 --> 02:27:39.071]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.052 --> 02:27:42.753]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:15.007 --> 02:28:18.968]  All this, plus hundreds of products, drawings, and fantastic giveaways.
[02:28:19.008 --> 02:28:22.709]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo celebrates all that's good about getting older.

[02:29:18.103 --> 02:29:21.604]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:30:46.183 --> 02:30:51.785]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:54.446 --> 02:30:58.747]  Waging war on corruption, crashing lies and disinformation.
[02:30:59.548 --> 02:31:12.232]  We've had the Mexican Attorney General called and carrying out the order for all of his employees to get into the secure areas to take implantable microchips.
[02:31:13.112 --> 02:31:20.274]  We have Andy Rooney calling for the forced implantation of the population with microchips to quote, tell who the good people are.
[02:31:20.575 --> 02:31:21.975]  We have the Army calling for it.
[02:31:22.615 --> 02:31:27.657]  We have all these TV shows promoting it to get into the newest club or to be cool.
[02:31:28.557 --> 02:31:35.320]  And one of our listeners, Eric, actually got the clip off CNN, thank God, that so many callers have been calling in about.
[02:31:36.180 --> 02:31:37.980]  And this happened just a few hours ago.
[02:31:38.000 --> 02:31:42.342]  And this is where Roberts is being questioned by a senator
[02:31:44.079 --> 02:31:50.322]  Senator Dornan about forced implantable microchipping.
[02:31:51.643 --> 02:31:54.724]  And so let's go ahead and play that clip.
[02:31:54.744 --> 02:31:56.385]  Here it is in your face.
[02:31:58.546 --> 02:32:00.567]  It must not stop now, Judge.
[02:32:00.927 --> 02:32:03.928]  And we'll be faced with equally consequential decisions in the 21st century.
[02:32:05.856 --> 02:32:10.198]  A microscopic tag being planted in a person's body to track his every movement.
[02:32:10.218 --> 02:32:12.038]  There's actual discussion about that.
[02:32:12.359 --> 02:32:16.400]  You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over.
[02:32:17.160 --> 02:32:22.943]  Can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined toward criminality or violent behavior?
[02:32:23.243 --> 02:32:25.364]  You will rule on that.
[02:32:26.584 --> 02:32:29.525]  Judge, I need to know whether you will be a justice of belief.
[02:32:30.385 --> 02:32:31.546]  That's it, Alex.
[02:32:32.125 --> 02:32:32.886]  Well, good job.
[02:32:32.926 --> 02:32:33.466]  Mail me that.
[02:32:33.566 --> 02:32:48.379]  And the point here is that it's so out in the open, it's being pushed so hard, that in a confirmation hearing for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, he's saying, will you forcibly make people take chips?
[02:32:49.300 --> 02:32:51.421]  And what did you think when you saw that?
[02:32:52.702 --> 02:32:54.944]  Basically, it let me know that those...
[02:32:56.475 --> 02:33:02.043]  Those who think they're in charge of this country and this world have taken their gloves off and put it right in our face.
[02:33:02.744 --> 02:33:03.084]  They are.
[02:33:03.104 --> 02:33:04.887]  They're a bunch of out-of-control devils.
[02:33:05.087 --> 02:33:07.330]  I mean, could there be any doubt?
[02:33:08.051 --> 02:33:08.712]  Not in my mind.
[02:33:10.034 --> 02:33:13.679]  Well, listen, I appreciate your hard work, and thanks for playing that for us.
[02:33:15.259 --> 02:33:16.159]  Take care, my friend.
[02:33:16.200 --> 02:33:17.900]  Anything else you wanted to add, Eric?
[02:33:19.021 --> 02:33:20.462]  No, that's basically it.
[02:33:20.562 --> 02:33:26.545]  I did get a video clip of the Conqueror Bush going through New Orleans today in his military convoy.
[02:33:27.385 --> 02:33:28.926]  Please send that to me as well.
[02:33:29.266 --> 02:33:30.247]  Okay, I sure will, Bay.
[02:33:30.467 --> 02:33:31.327]  Thank you so much.
[02:33:31.607 --> 02:33:38.771]  And again, I need you listeners to take the news, to isolate the particular key things, to send it to me because...
[02:33:39.759 --> 02:33:42.540]  It's a task just to watch it.
[02:33:43.100 --> 02:33:45.161]  It's a task just to try to put it on television.
[02:33:45.201 --> 02:33:47.522]  It's a task to try to comment on it.
[02:33:48.883 --> 02:33:55.425]  That's why I get a little bit frantic and hectic sounding and frayed at the edges because it's just there's so much evil coming down on us.
[02:33:56.026 --> 02:34:00.848]  Let me play some of these clips and I'll cover some of the top news I haven't gotten to yet today.
[02:34:02.768 --> 02:34:08.651]  This first clip is ABC News where they're trying to poo-poo that is whitewashed bombs on the levees.
[02:34:09.904 --> 02:34:22.208]  But we've got Globe and Mail articles out of Canada where they've got reporters down there interviewing cops and people like parole officers saying, yeah, bombs went off.
[02:34:24.309 --> 02:34:30.271]  We've got other witnesses saying they saw this, but Bill Clinton got asked about this and walked off the stage.
[02:34:31.332 --> 02:34:33.352]  We posted that clip last week.
[02:34:34.793 --> 02:34:38.134]  So here is this little report as we analyze it.
[02:34:39.048 --> 02:34:47.810]  This is the actual levee that runs along the canal on the eastern side of the city, and when the hurricane hit, the water came through the canal at such force it was apparently too much.
[02:34:48.190 --> 02:34:53.931]  You can see the massive breach here, and when you look around the corner, you can see what the water did to the Lower Ninth Ward.
[02:34:54.431 --> 02:34:56.212]  It completely destroyed neighborhoods.
[02:34:56.732 --> 02:34:57.832]  I heard something open.
[02:34:57.952 --> 02:34:58.332]  Boo!
[02:34:59.152 --> 02:35:03.213]  Joe Edwards rushed to get himself and as many neighbors as possible into his truck.
[02:35:03.633 --> 02:35:06.334]  They drove to this bridge where they've been living ever since.
[02:35:06.354 --> 02:35:07.854]  My house broke in half.
[02:35:08.968 --> 02:35:10.670]  My mother's house is just the semi-grid.
[02:35:10.690 --> 02:35:12.092]  It was a brick house.
[02:35:12.192 --> 02:35:15.477]  All the houses down there floated down the street like somebody's guide.
[02:35:16.218 --> 02:35:18.320]  Was it solely the water that broke the levee?
[02:35:18.581 --> 02:35:22.085]  Or was it the force of this barge that now sits where Holmes once did?
[02:35:22.626 --> 02:35:23.908]  Joe Edwards says neither.
[02:35:24.268 --> 02:35:27.112]  People are so bitter, so disenfranchised in this neighborhood.
[02:35:27.572 --> 02:35:32.238]  They actually think the city did it, blowing up the levee to save richer neighborhoods like the French Quarter.
[02:35:32.638 --> 02:35:33.479]  So you're convinced?
[02:35:33.860 --> 02:35:35.021]  I noticed it happened.
[02:35:35.061 --> 02:35:36.242]  That they broke the levee on purpose?
[02:35:36.262 --> 02:35:36.863]  They blew it!
[02:35:37.324 --> 02:35:39.826]  New Orleans mayor says there's no credence to this.
[02:35:40.387 --> 02:35:44.692]  That storm was so powerful and it pushed so much water.
[02:35:45.213 --> 02:35:47.135]  There's no way anyone could have calculated it.
[02:35:48.078 --> 02:35:50.900]  Well, now notice they didn't talk to that gentleman a little bit more.
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:51.881]  He looked pretty credible.
[02:35:51.961 --> 02:35:53.602]  He just says, I know they did.
[02:35:53.622 --> 02:35:54.182]  They blew it.
[02:35:54.222 --> 02:35:55.744]  They didn't say, well, how do you know?
[02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:19.941]  I mean, we have cops.
[02:36:20.141 --> 02:36:24.783]  We have other people saying that explosions went off at at least three locations.
[02:36:26.643 --> 02:36:28.444]  But let's just ignore that as usual.
[02:36:28.504 --> 02:36:33.667]  It's like 800 witnesses saw two missiles hit TWA Flight 800.
[02:36:34.007 --> 02:36:41.450]  300 plus of those, of the just masses of witnesses, were helicopter pilots and Navy ship pilots.
[02:36:42.754 --> 02:36:43.374]  You know, hands.
[02:36:43.874 --> 02:36:50.875]  Some of them, dozens and dozens of them, I've interviewed them, were Vietnam veterans flying those helicopters who'd seen missiles.
[02:36:52.236 --> 02:36:53.016]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:36:53.036 --> 02:36:58.277]  It doesn't matter if reporters sneak in and get explosives residue out of the hangar.
[02:36:59.057 --> 02:37:01.337]  Then they got arrested for doing it, showing they'd been hit.
[02:37:02.637 --> 02:37:04.158]  I mean, it just never ends, folks.
[02:37:04.538 --> 02:37:04.878]  No!
[02:37:05.058 --> 02:37:06.098]  No explosions!
[02:37:06.318 --> 02:37:06.898]  Shut up!
[02:37:10.599 --> 02:37:11.859]  It really does make your head spin.
[02:37:13.397 --> 02:37:18.523]  This next clip is shooting dogs.
[02:37:18.763 --> 02:37:21.546]  This is from the Dallas Morning News website.
[02:37:22.947 --> 02:37:25.850]  And they sent their photojournalist out who also shot some video.
[02:37:26.751 --> 02:37:29.874]  And obviously, you'll hear gunshots in the background.
[02:37:29.894 --> 02:37:31.636]  They're pretty quiet because they're inside a truck.
[02:37:31.836 --> 02:37:32.397]  Pew, pew, pew.
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:53.371]  And troops are killing dogs, then they deny it, and then you see other troops taking care of dogs, and they talk to cops that are killing dogs, and I mean, these are like fat family dogs that will live on mice and grass and could easily be, you know, rounded up, but they're just out shooting them.
[02:37:53.491 --> 02:37:55.512]  And then it's on the news, why gunfire?
[02:37:55.832 --> 02:37:58.634]  And then they always quietly announce, no, it was cops shooting dogs or...
[02:37:59.741 --> 02:38:06.757]  But cops still get to freak out and bust down doors because we're looking for the snipers when it's idiot cops over the next hill shooting dogs.
[02:38:08.326 --> 02:38:09.547]  These people are out of control.
[02:38:09.967 --> 02:38:11.368]  They want to be tough guys.
[02:38:11.668 --> 02:38:12.729]  They want to be soldiers.
[02:38:12.769 --> 02:38:13.830]  They want to fight an enemy.
[02:38:14.170 --> 02:38:15.391]  They call us civilians.
[02:38:15.451 --> 02:38:16.191]  We're the enemy.
[02:38:16.531 --> 02:38:17.532]  They're our gods.
[02:38:18.072 --> 02:38:19.393]  Go ahead and roll the next clip.
[02:38:19.974 --> 02:38:34.303]  Unfortunately, a lot of people's pets are gone and wandering around, so we're trying to gather them up as much as we can here, give them some food and water until I guess they have the SPCA and a lot of dog foundations and animal shelters coming to pick them up.
[02:38:34.603 --> 02:38:36.344]  Try and hoard them over here where the dog food is.
[02:38:38.553 --> 02:38:40.214]  We'll try and keep them alive until they get here.
[02:38:40.614 --> 02:38:42.355]  Well, they're shooting them three blocks down.
[02:38:42.595 --> 02:38:42.875]  Are they?
[02:38:43.116 --> 02:38:43.936]  Well, that's not us.
[02:38:49.579 --> 02:38:50.920]  They just killed that dog, man.
[02:38:51.140 --> 02:38:55.823]  This place is going crazy.
[02:38:55.863 --> 02:38:59.164]  Oh, it was all the way up, and then they shot him.
[02:38:59.525 --> 02:38:59.985]  Same dog.
[02:39:03.470 --> 02:39:04.411]  I just shot that one, too.
[02:39:04.911 --> 02:39:05.832]  Reach yourself out the window.
[02:39:05.852 --> 02:39:06.493]  Just roll it down.
[02:39:06.533 --> 02:39:07.013]  He's still alive.
[02:39:07.053 --> 02:39:07.834]  Roll it down, roll it down.
[02:39:07.854 --> 02:39:08.535]  I can't do it, David.
[02:39:08.575 --> 02:39:09.055]  He's still alive.
[02:39:09.115 --> 02:39:09.676]  Roll it down.
[02:39:09.696 --> 02:39:09.936]  Stop.
[02:39:10.016 --> 02:39:11.457]  Roll that window down.
[02:39:13.219 --> 02:39:15.021]  Really, it's better for that dog, really.
[02:39:15.521 --> 02:39:17.743]  Because, you know, where's he going to find food?
[02:39:17.823 --> 02:39:19.785]  Where's he going to find water?
[02:39:19.825 --> 02:39:21.046]  You know, so I just look at it.
[02:39:21.066 --> 02:39:21.587]  It's more humane.
[02:39:21.667 --> 02:39:24.729]  We're doing it to protect ourselves, but it's more humane for the dog, you know?
[02:39:27.498 --> 02:39:29.459]  They tried to eat us.
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:33.862]  Four days into it, he almost got eaten up by a pit bull.
[02:39:33.942 --> 02:39:34.322]  Hey!
[02:39:34.403 --> 02:39:35.783]  Hey, Tom!
[02:39:35.944 --> 02:39:36.164]  Tom!
[02:39:36.524 --> 02:39:36.744]  Tom!
[02:39:36.764 --> 02:39:38.385]  So how many dogs?
[02:39:38.865 --> 02:39:40.667]  Enough.
[02:39:42.688 --> 02:39:46.891]  Must be a tough job.
[02:39:48.312 --> 02:39:48.452]  Huh?
[02:39:50.453 --> 02:39:52.114]  Must be a tough job.
[02:39:54.088 --> 02:39:54.428]  This guy?
[02:39:54.468 --> 02:39:57.170]  No, I've been doing this job for 22 years.
[02:39:58.011 --> 02:40:00.272]  There's numerous dogs running around here.
[02:40:00.392 --> 02:40:03.314]  Basset hounds, little small beagles, poodles.
[02:40:04.135 --> 02:40:10.119]  And when you drive up to them, they kind of run up to you thinking maybe you... I'm getting the feeling maybe they think you're their owner.
[02:40:14.462 --> 02:40:15.503]  Everybody forgets about them.
[02:40:15.523 --> 02:40:18.625]  They don't really remember, you know, that the dogs need help too.
[02:40:18.665 --> 02:40:21.147]  They didn't really have a choice on, you know, getting out.
[02:40:23.013 --> 02:40:39.523]  I heard a guy from New Orleans on the air about when he heard the floodwaters were coming, he just left his dachshund and said, you're on your own, buddy.
[02:40:41.044 --> 02:40:42.165]  And he didn't even have children.
[02:40:42.205 --> 02:40:45.147]  I mean, why wouldn't you stick the dachshund in a backpack?
[02:40:45.387 --> 02:40:45.988]  Why wouldn't you?
[02:40:47.409 --> 02:40:49.430]  See, people are so self-centered, too.
[02:40:50.862 --> 02:40:54.724]  That they don't even care about their own family dogs.
[02:40:55.044 --> 02:40:55.884]  At least this guy didn't.
[02:40:55.924 --> 02:40:56.684]  I heard it on the radio.
[02:40:58.325 --> 02:41:00.846]  He was just, oh yeah, I just left my dogs.
[02:41:00.946 --> 02:41:02.827]  I said, you're on your own, buddy.
[02:41:04.248 --> 02:41:06.028]  I mean, what is wrong with people?
[02:41:07.409 --> 02:41:08.389]  And then countless others.
[02:41:08.990 --> 02:41:11.431]  If it's children, the dogs, leave the dogs.
[02:41:12.231 --> 02:41:13.932]  If my kids were starving, I'd eat my dogs.
[02:41:14.012 --> 02:41:14.692]  I love my dogs.
[02:41:15.192 --> 02:41:16.913]  But I'm just saying, people come first, but
[02:41:18.041 --> 02:41:20.222]  The dogs they're killing are like beagles and stuff.
[02:41:20.242 --> 02:41:22.244]  And the guy's like, look at how vicious that dog is.
[02:41:22.404 --> 02:41:26.366]  And it's like some puppy growling at him by his owner's house.
[02:41:27.166 --> 02:41:29.047]  I have to kill him, dog.
[02:41:29.668 --> 02:41:30.788]  They'd be threatening.
[02:41:31.309 --> 02:41:33.330]  Look, the military is out having just a heyday.
[02:41:33.870 --> 02:41:39.213]  You've got some groups of the troops that are feeding them and being sweet to them, and then other groups of the gang member type military.
[02:41:40.094 --> 02:41:40.594]  You know what?
[02:41:41.935 --> 02:41:43.756]  Find that clip where they run over the car.
[02:41:45.006 --> 02:41:46.448]  That's what you get when you loot.
[02:41:46.548 --> 02:41:48.370]  You know that clip from Baghdad?
[02:41:50.051 --> 02:41:53.255]  Because, understand folks, the police were looting.
[02:41:53.275 --> 02:41:54.676]  The police were looting for food and water.
[02:41:55.117 --> 02:41:58.620]  And sure, there were a few scumbags doing bad stuff, but they hyped that up.
[02:41:58.660 --> 02:42:07.670]  And most of the cases of shooting were cops shooting at alligators or dogs or whatever, and then, oh, somebody's shooting in the relief effort.
[02:42:10.504 --> 02:42:15.988]  Basically, you got a bunch of Billy Bad Butts who want to rule everybody, and this is their chance to earn their wings.
[02:42:16.309 --> 02:42:18.090]  I was in the battle for New Orleans.
[02:42:20.132 --> 02:42:21.753]  I made 100 women flash me.
[02:42:21.853 --> 02:42:27.217]  I robbed two jewelry stores and got fat off canned goods.
[02:42:27.577 --> 02:42:30.960]  It was real tough, and I killed 125 dogs.
[02:42:32.181 --> 02:42:34.002]  You got the that's-what-you-get-when-you-loot clip?
[02:42:35.463 --> 02:42:37.085]  All right, soon as we find that out.
[02:42:37.145 --> 02:42:38.526]  And then I've got this other clip here.
[02:42:40.134 --> 02:42:46.678]  About the American Al-Ci-Aida from ABC News.
[02:42:49.380 --> 02:42:55.183]  And now they can't even find fat guys, fat Muslims, to pose as bin Laden anymore.
[02:42:55.243 --> 02:42:56.244]  Now it's just white guys.
[02:42:57.144 --> 02:43:00.286]  Type-released American Al-Qaeda member warns of attacks.
[02:43:01.329 --> 02:43:06.615]  American Al-Qaeda member says that Al-Qaeda is about to attack us, Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:07.235 --> 02:43:12.781]  Adam Gadhan is identified as the spokesman in this latest Al-Qaeda tape.
[02:43:13.662 --> 02:43:20.289]  In an apparent September 11th communicated broadcast on ABC News, an Al-Qaeda operative threatens new attacks against cities in the U.S.
[02:43:20.709 --> 02:43:21.390]  and Australia.
[02:43:22.190 --> 02:43:24.132]  And he goes, Yesterday, London and Madrid.
[02:43:24.172 --> 02:43:25.813]  Tomorrow, Los Angeles and Melbourne.
[02:43:26.314 --> 02:43:27.074]  All are willing.
[02:43:27.455 --> 02:43:31.098]  And this time, don't count on us demonstrating restraint or compassion.
[02:43:31.118 --> 02:43:31.818]  The tape warms.
[02:43:32.199 --> 02:43:33.059]  We are Muslims.
[02:43:33.119 --> 02:43:33.960]  We love peace.
[02:43:34.280 --> 02:43:35.421]  But peace on our terms.
[02:43:35.862 --> 02:43:38.964]  They always got to have something that sounds a little reasonable to make you think it's real.
[02:43:39.365 --> 02:43:40.986]  This is so fake.
[02:43:42.728 --> 02:43:47.412]  You got another sheep-dipped Special Forces individual out posing as Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:47.832 --> 02:43:48.833]  Go ahead and roll the tape.
[02:43:50.234 --> 02:43:57.941]  Four years after the blessed raids on New York and Washington... Officials say his name is Adam Gadon of Orange County, California.
[02:43:58.442 --> 02:43:59.943]  Gadon is well known to U.S.
[02:43:59.983 --> 02:44:03.847]  authorities as an Al-Qaeda operative believed to be living in Pakistan.
[02:44:04.597 --> 02:44:09.339]  Gadan delivered a similar tape communique for Al-Qaeda last year, later deemed to be authentic.
[02:44:09.739 --> 02:44:15.481]  This year, appearing to read from a script, Gadan delivers a very pointed Al-Qaeda threat against two cities.
[02:44:15.901 --> 02:44:17.681]  One in the US, one in Australia.
[02:44:17.941 --> 02:44:20.422]  Yesterday, London and Madrid.
[02:44:20.862 --> 02:44:23.763]  Tomorrow, Los Angeles and Melbourne.
[02:44:24.263 --> 02:44:24.864]  Allah willing.
[02:44:25.104 --> 02:44:29.225]  And this time, don't count on us demonstrating restraint or compassion.
[02:44:30.484 --> 02:44:31.245]  We are Muslims.
[02:44:31.785 --> 02:44:32.525]  We love peace.
[02:44:33.106 --> 02:44:34.587]  But peace on our terms.
[02:44:34.847 --> 02:44:40.510]  The 11-minute long diatribe appears to have the same graphics and production techniques recognized by U.S.
[02:44:40.550 --> 02:44:43.652]  officials as part of Al-Qaeda's standard propaganda production.
[02:44:44.252 --> 02:44:46.494]  This one is clearly aimed at the U.S.
[02:44:46.554 --> 02:44:46.894]  and Britain.
[02:44:47.677 --> 02:44:53.724]  Don't believe the lies of the liars at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and 10 Downing Street.
[02:44:54.144 --> 02:45:02.834]  They have dispatched your sons and daughters to die lonely deaths in the burning deserts of Iraq and the unforgiving mountains of Afghanistan.
[02:45:04.215 --> 02:45:10.598]  Only a few years ago, Adam Gadon was a Southern California teenager interested in the environment and heavy metal music.
[02:45:10.858 --> 02:45:18.682]  His family says he converted to Islam at an Orange County mosque, where officials say Gadon came under the influence of militants who took him to Pakistan.
[02:45:19.243 --> 02:45:25.646]  Now he seems to be an Al-Qaeda propaganda tool, warning Americans an attack is coming unless the U.S.
[02:45:25.666 --> 02:45:27.987]  stops its actions in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:45:28.447 --> 02:45:29.208]  We love peace!
[02:45:30.029 --> 02:45:42.078]  But when the enemy violates that peace, or prevents us from achieving it, then we love nothing better than the heat of battle, the echo of explosions, and slitting the throats of the infidels.
[02:45:45.380 --> 02:45:46.561]  So, there you have it.
[02:45:46.621 --> 02:45:51.585]  Anytime we don't want to fight the war, anytime we're getting sick of the garbage, this pops up.
[02:45:51.625 --> 02:45:59.391]  I mean, Colin Powell goes to Congress, calling for the war with Iraq, and Congress is saying, but Saddam isn't with Al-Qaeda.
[02:46:00.382 --> 02:46:04.545]  And he goes, oh, well, there's a tape on Al Jazeera right now where bin Laden says he's with him.
[02:46:05.326 --> 02:46:10.269]  And the reporters all run out of the room and come back later, and they go, well, there's no tape of that.
[02:46:10.850 --> 02:46:12.491]  Oh, don't worry, it'll be on soon.
[02:46:13.492 --> 02:46:17.054]  You know, bin Laden always agrees with our government, always helping.
[02:46:17.635 --> 02:46:20.157]  By the way, I found even more photos of him in the U.S.
[02:46:20.257 --> 02:46:23.119]  and in England, more of his little CIA photos.
[02:46:23.539 --> 02:46:25.941]  It's just, it's so staged.
[02:46:26.957 --> 02:46:32.140]  It's so staged, and I, for one, am completely sick of it.
[02:46:32.400 --> 02:46:34.421]  Let's play the clip as they run over the cars.
[02:46:35.782 --> 02:46:41.605]  This is what happens when you loot, and it's our own military and government looting.
[02:46:41.985 --> 02:46:47.168]  Go ahead and roll where they run over somebody's car for stealing firewood out of a field.
[02:46:47.609 --> 02:46:49.990]  This is the freedom we give them in Iraq.
[02:46:50.030 --> 02:46:50.770]  Go ahead and play it.
[02:46:51.131 --> 02:46:53.432]  There was still some looting going on when we arrived.
[02:46:57.009 --> 02:47:00.530]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[02:47:02.370 --> 02:47:08.232]  That child don't need to be here.
[02:47:08.272 --> 02:47:12.713]  We filmed these GIs after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[02:47:13.453 --> 02:47:19.375]  We try to stop them from looting, they don't understand, so we take that car and we'll crush it.
[02:47:19.415 --> 02:47:20.815]  United States Army tankers, whore.
[02:47:53.510 --> 02:47:54.271]  Then they laugh.
[02:47:57.393 --> 02:48:01.576]  That's what you get when you loot.
[02:48:02.917 --> 02:48:06.620]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[02:48:07.401 --> 02:48:08.882]  The car was my livelihood.
[02:48:09.862 --> 02:48:15.206]  Now again, in the front line piece, it's a little bitty junk car, a family, and they find two sticks of wood in the back.
[02:48:16.347 --> 02:48:21.051]  And then they just, the gang members, that's what you get when you loot.
[02:48:21.747 --> 02:48:23.388]  That child don't need to be here.
[02:48:23.968 --> 02:48:25.529]  Well, the city's on fire.
[02:48:25.789 --> 02:48:27.811]  No one's in school, you sickos.
[02:48:28.811 --> 02:48:32.253]  And imagine this family sitting there going, they're just standing there in horror.
[02:48:32.533 --> 02:48:39.297]  And the guys are... Well, you're going to get it too, America.
[02:48:39.538 --> 02:48:43.560]  These people can't wait to have their way with you and your women.
[02:48:45.959 --> 02:48:47.440]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.620 --> 02:48:50.722]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.842 --> 02:48:54.764]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.804 --> 02:48:59.047]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.387 --> 02:49:03.149]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.289 --> 02:49:05.090]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.310 --> 02:49:08.592]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.632 --> 02:49:13.356]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.516 --> 02:49:16.558]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:49:16.738 --> 02:49:19.580]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.081 --> 02:49:26.205]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.425 --> 02:49:27.406]  Go to my website, InfoWars.com.

[02:49:58.537 --> 02:50:02.039]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:50:02.259 --> 02:50:02.499]  I think.
[02:50:23.439 --> 02:50:30.364]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:50:55.015 --> 02:51:01.384]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.704 --> 02:51:02.365]  We're good to go.
[02:51:21.988 --> 02:51:22.568]  We're good to go.
[02:51:50.340 --> 02:52:04.467]  I'll tell you, most of our military now in the enlisted ranks have been recruited right out of the inner cities, right out of gangland, right out of the poorest white areas of white trashdom.
[02:52:05.907 --> 02:52:09.189]  And they just will do whatever they're told.
[02:52:09.815 --> 02:52:12.017]  And I've got so many reports, so many clips.
[02:52:12.477 --> 02:52:15.580]  Marines would just shoot women and laugh about it right in front of reporters.
[02:52:16.001 --> 02:52:18.823]  Reporters would go, you just splattered that woman's head from 200 yards.
[02:52:19.083 --> 02:52:21.185]  That's right, I did, and I'll kill more of them!
[02:52:22.967 --> 02:52:24.528]  Well, you just killed a five-year-old child.
[02:52:24.568 --> 02:52:26.390]  That's right, I'm not killing children!
[02:52:27.011 --> 02:52:28.312]  And I'll kill more!
[02:52:29.881 --> 02:52:34.365]  Then the reporter hauls off and slugs the Marine in the face and they grab and arrest the reporter.
[02:52:34.605 --> 02:52:35.806]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[02:52:36.087 --> 02:52:37.948]  They've turned our men into animals.
[02:52:38.309 --> 02:52:39.510]  Well, look at the whole country.
[02:52:39.710 --> 02:52:40.891]  We are a bunch of animals.
[02:52:41.792 --> 02:52:44.274]  A bunch of self-centered, reprobate demons.
[02:52:45.436 --> 02:52:49.219]  And you think you're safe in America when your police and your military is being turned into this?
[02:52:49.459 --> 02:52:51.401]  And I don't want to hear my son or daughter is in the military.
[02:52:51.421 --> 02:52:52.301]  Don't say they're all evil.
[02:52:52.582 --> 02:52:53.502]  Folks, I've seen it.
[02:52:53.763 --> 02:52:55.044]  I've talked to people in the military.
[02:52:55.304 --> 02:52:55.924]  I've witnessed it.
[02:52:56.365 --> 02:52:59.927]  And a lot of your front-line combat troops are scary.
[02:53:01.609 --> 02:53:03.190]  And now we're seeing it in New Orleans.
[02:53:03.530 --> 02:53:05.852]  I mean, that's what happens when you loot.
[02:53:07.173 --> 02:53:08.794]  This is like a few days into the invasion.
[02:53:08.854 --> 02:53:09.695]  The city's on fire.
[02:53:10.837 --> 02:53:12.339]  That child don't need to be here.
[02:53:12.359 --> 02:53:13.680]  He should be in school.
[02:53:14.121 --> 02:53:15.903]  How do you expect the child to be in school?
[02:53:17.705 --> 02:53:18.506]  And they show the car.
[02:53:18.586 --> 02:53:20.408]  There's two sticks of firewood in the back.
[02:53:20.608 --> 02:53:22.531]  They think they might have taken some firewood.
[02:53:23.091 --> 02:53:23.972]  So we're going to run.
[02:53:24.513 --> 02:53:31.481]  We have to laugh about it and shoot your car first and run over it.
[02:53:32.415 --> 02:53:36.017]  I could just see white trash out there going, I support the troops.
[02:53:36.537 --> 02:53:39.658]  Yeah, the troops could be raping your wife and cutting her head off while they do it.
[02:53:39.939 --> 02:53:41.539]  And you'd go, oh, good.
[02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:44.040]  Oh, here, troops, have my daughter.
[02:53:44.941 --> 02:53:46.101]  Have my Second Amendment.
[02:53:46.301 --> 02:53:48.102]  Have the whole country while you're at it.
[02:53:49.983 --> 02:53:52.204]  I did this news flashback from 32704 a year and a half ago.
[02:53:54.657 --> 02:53:55.718]  Early 2004.
[02:53:56.299 --> 02:54:00.082]  It's a groundbreaking court decision that legal experts say will affect everyone.
[02:54:00.122 --> 02:54:06.307]  Police officers in Louisiana no longer need a search warrant or arrest warrant to conduct a brief search of your home or business.
[02:54:06.748 --> 02:54:11.392]  And then it says they're going around to houses going, we're just here to search your house, ballpark of the new freedom.
[02:54:11.972 --> 02:54:18.658]  Leaders in law enforcement say it will provide safety to officers, but others argue it is a privilege that could be abused.
[02:54:18.978 --> 02:54:20.259]  It's called the Fourth Amendment!
[02:54:20.279 --> 02:54:22.021]  You're not bigger than that, criminals!
[02:54:22.719 --> 02:54:25.661]  The decision was made by the New Orleans-Bathurst District Court of Appeals.
[02:54:26.121 --> 02:54:28.963]  Two dissenting judges called it the road to hell.
[02:54:29.984 --> 02:54:31.705]  The road to hell.
[02:54:31.725 --> 02:54:34.667]  I ought to make a new film called The Road to Hell.
[02:54:35.088 --> 02:54:37.169]  I've already made The Road to Tyranny.
[02:54:37.830 --> 02:54:39.551]  Now it's Road to Hell.
[02:54:40.852 --> 02:54:44.154]  You know, I always get emails saying that there's no such thing as cancer viruses.
[02:54:44.594 --> 02:54:46.255]  Every week I see a new deadly one.
[02:54:46.656 --> 02:54:48.837]  Here's one out of the Scotsman.
[02:54:48.957 --> 02:54:51.239]  Scientists seek to unravel complex virus...
[02:54:52.456 --> 02:54:58.242]  And it says few people have ever heard of it, yet most of us will not have escaped infection.
[02:54:58.963 --> 02:55:05.290]  The Epstein-Barr virus, EPV, kills tens of thousands every year in the UK and the US.
[02:55:06.051 --> 02:55:10.375]  And it's a luscious virus, and they don't know why it's spreading.
[02:55:10.415 --> 02:55:11.436]  It's in the vaccines!
[02:55:11.476 --> 02:55:12.557]  I've got reports on it!
[02:55:13.378 --> 02:55:14.760]  So roll up your sleeves!
[02:55:15.447 --> 02:55:17.107]  You thought SV40 was bad?
[02:55:17.687 --> 02:55:19.888]  Charm Tour to promote ID cards.
[02:55:20.348 --> 02:55:30.130]  BBC ministers are being sent on a charm offensive tour to educate the public about the technology behind ID cards and to promote its implementation.
[02:55:33.471 --> 02:55:35.171]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:36.791 --> 02:55:40.912]  Just take your chips, take your PCP, and worship your government.
[02:55:42.772 --> 02:55:44.033]  I'm sorry, take your Prozac.
[02:55:44.573 --> 02:55:44.893]  Same as...
[02:55:45.666 --> 02:55:47.608]  Folks, get my new film, Martial Law.
[02:55:47.728 --> 02:55:48.008]  Get it.
[02:55:48.048 --> 02:55:48.829]  Make copies of it.
[02:55:48.849 --> 02:55:49.509]  Get it out to people.
[02:55:49.549 --> 02:55:50.230]  Do not wait.
[02:55:50.550 --> 02:55:52.351]  Go to InfoWars.com to get it.

[02:56:07.263 --> 02:56:12.047]  The New World Order is making a big move right now, and they're showing everybody what they are.
[02:56:12.447 --> 02:56:14.749]  So like Patrick Henry said, let it come!
[02:56:15.532 --> 02:56:17.173]  Come on, let's get it on!
[02:56:17.654 --> 02:56:19.255]  Show us just how bad you are!
[02:56:19.515 --> 02:56:21.097]  Show everybody who the enemy is!
[02:56:21.357 --> 02:56:22.598]  Show them you're the bad guy!
[02:56:22.618 --> 02:56:23.839]  God bless you all!
