[00:00:05.433 --> 00:00:06.073]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:07.814]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.514 --> 00:00:09.634]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.254 --> 00:00:11.114]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:12.735]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.755 --> 00:00:17.036]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.596 --> 00:00:21.737]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.837 --> 00:00:23.818]  Music
[00:00:37.933 --> 00:00:39.313]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:39.393 --> 00:00:42.014]  It is Thursday, the 14th day of April 2005.
[00:00:42.114 --> 00:00:49.335]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout this broadcast, this transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:49.995 --> 00:00:52.476]  The toll-free number to join me on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:52.496 --> 00:00:52.596]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:54.856]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:56.437]  Any news item you want to discuss...
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.065]  Like the latest bombing in Baghdad, or perhaps the IMF saying, oh yes, peak oil's real.
[00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:21.010]  You're going to have to pay hundreds of dollars a barrel and give in to your world government.
[00:01:21.731 --> 00:01:33.640]  We can also discuss the supposed guilty pleas of Eric Rudolph and how he supposedly told the feds where to find dynamite.
[00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.442]  I don't believe any of this.
[00:01:36.286 --> 00:01:41.090]  Because of what we've seen the FBI do in the past on this case.
[00:01:43.251 --> 00:01:54.660]  Also, I want to discuss more what happened with the 5,000 plus laboratories, laboratories, mailed this super flu virus from the 1950s.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.845]  Because I got a few emails yesterday of people that didn't understand the point I was making about it and
[00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.470]  Didn't understand why this was such a problem.
[00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:12.072]  We'll be discussing that coming up later in the broadcast as well.
[00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:17.193]  Israel presents aerial photos of Iran nuclear sites to Bush.
[00:02:18.714 --> 00:02:23.535]  And Ariel Sharon then asks Bush to put pressure on them or basically go in and attack them.
[00:02:24.207 --> 00:02:35.011]  And that's exactly what this meeting out at the little Hollywood set was in Crawford, out at the fake ranch, literally with fake hay bales and tractors.
[00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:36.552]  Admittedly, it's been on the news.
[00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:38.173]  Parked there to give it a look.
[00:02:39.053 --> 00:02:51.578]  Out there, I saw a little editorial cartoon, Joe's Bush pointing out with Sharon towards the press corps by the hundreds, and he says, look at the
[00:02:52.677 --> 00:02:54.278]  Cattle I raised on this ranch.
[00:02:54.358 --> 00:02:57.319]  I also raised these reporters here on the ranch.
[00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:05.121]  And the cartoon said something else I can't repeat on the air, but it's pretty interesting.
[00:03:05.701 --> 00:03:09.523]  Israel presents aerial photos of Iran nuclear sites to Bush.
[00:03:09.903 --> 00:03:15.545]  Why was Israel that fed us a lot of the fake data to begin with about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?
[00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:16.625]  But that's okay.
[00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:18.246]  That's alright.
[00:03:18.286 --> 00:03:19.706]  We should believe Ariel Sharon.
[00:03:19.746 --> 00:03:22.087]  He's a very nice man and
[00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:26.156]  Well, he's told the Knesset that he owns and runs America.
[00:03:26.677 --> 00:03:29.679]  That's been in major Israeli newspapers.
[00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:31.960]  So I'm all for it.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.603]  I think it's great when foreign leaders say they own our Congress.
[00:03:36.264 --> 00:03:39.106]  I think it's great when Vicente Fox tells our government what to do.
[00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:41.627]  I think it's great when China tells us what to do.
[00:03:42.648 --> 00:03:43.089]  I love it.
[00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.712]  It's just absolutely, absolutely wonderful.
[00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:54.661]  Continuing here, you know the government wants to force vaccines on every child in England.
[00:03:54.681 --> 00:03:55.962]  They're talking about it here as well.
[00:03:55.982 --> 00:04:12.869]  It will permanently alter brain chemistry to where you cannot get the euphoric or calming effects of cocaine, heroin, and nicotine because it blocks the receptors.
[00:04:12.889 --> 00:04:14.869]  It actually creates a plaque in the brain.
[00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:16.290]  The virus actually attacks your cells.
[00:04:16.937 --> 00:04:18.718]  Sounds wonderful to me, doesn't it to you?
[00:04:19.638 --> 00:04:28.100]  And they're trying to make it the law in England, but the latest thing, this is out of the Journal of Science, also the New Scientist is reporting on it.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.281]  Will cancer vaccine get to all women?
[00:04:32.261 --> 00:04:33.802]  Talking about making it the law.
[00:04:33.822 --> 00:04:37.003]  Got a new special injection for you.
[00:04:37.023 --> 00:04:41.784]  This is going to be the new tyranny after they're done scaring you with their flu they release.
[00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:45.545]  We just have to report every week to get the new vaccine.
[00:04:46.835 --> 00:04:49.957]  We'll all be behaving ourselves better after we get these injections.
[00:04:50.037 --> 00:04:50.777]  Oh, yes.
[00:04:51.918 --> 00:04:57.381]  We'll be feeling much better and liking the New World Order a lot more, and some of us will be drooling in the corner.
[00:05:00.963 --> 00:05:05.325]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.485 --> 00:05:09.928]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.068 --> 00:05:14.470]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.831]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.612 --> 00:05:21.834]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.894 --> 00:05:28.838]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:31.059]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:41.706]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.966 --> 00:05:42.466]  If you want to
[00:05:42.586 --> 00:05:42.846]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:42.866 --> 00:05:43.727]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:06.232]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:06.592 --> 00:06:10.673]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:10.973 --> 00:06:11.514]  We listened.
[00:06:11.834 --> 00:06:16.816]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:17.076 --> 00:06:17.576]  We listened.
[00:06:17.956 --> 00:06:20.997]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:21.417 --> 00:06:21.958]  We listened.
[00:06:22.418 --> 00:06:25.579]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:26.380]  We're good to go.
[00:06:50.517 --> 00:06:50.597]  803-4438.
[00:06:50.617 --> 00:06:51.759]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.779 --> 00:06:52.881]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.484 --> 00:07:02.826]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:03.086 --> 00:07:06.930]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:08.071]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:12.615]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:12.855 --> 00:07:17.038]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:22.283]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:22.663 --> 00:07:26.266]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.446 --> 00:07:31.790]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:34.792]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:35.093 --> 00:07:35.973]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:36.274 --> 00:07:42.038]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.286]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:08:08.879 --> 00:08:11.140]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.401]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.441 --> 00:08:17.102]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.622 --> 00:08:21.784]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:30.987 --> 00:08:35.369]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Information Ward,
[00:08:37.327 --> 00:08:55.322]  From the battle for the republic, from the fight for humanity against total dehumanization being engaged in by the technocrats and their allied think tanks owned by the private global crime syndicates known as the New World Order, Globalism, Globalization.
[00:08:56.703 --> 00:08:59.526]  It's about getting you dependent, getting you under their control.
[00:09:00.366 --> 00:09:04.570]  Human history is a long train and string of events
[00:09:05.433 --> 00:09:15.279]  Of populations being enslaved, of feudalism, of serfdom, of slavery, of bondage, of egregious despotism.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:28.828]  Despotism will always grow to the maximum point until there is a breaking point and the people resist it.
[00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:31.890]  The level of tyranny you will live under
[00:09:32.665 --> 00:09:41.187]  The level of corruption you will live under is the exact, precise level that you will accept.
[00:09:42.447 --> 00:09:44.588]  Now, the Greek philosophers said that.
[00:09:44.608 --> 00:09:47.589]  The Founding Fathers wrote and stated and spoke that.
[00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:49.889]  Common sense dictates that.
[00:09:50.489 --> 00:09:56.071]  The laws of nature and humanity and civilization and time immemorial show that.
[00:09:57.251 --> 00:09:57.451]  But...
[00:09:59.324 --> 00:10:08.330]  The modern population has been conditioned, has been trained to go along, to get along, to do whatever is easier, at least according to the government.
[00:10:09.431 --> 00:10:17.036]  And so, many yuppies, many minions of this system will laugh at you if you say the government's corrupt.
[00:10:17.096 --> 00:10:18.577]  They will say that doesn't exist.
[00:10:18.757 --> 00:10:20.739]  Government is pure good.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.462]  And then if you argue with them and show them examples of government doing bad...
[00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:32.534]  They'll say, okay, well, that's the way it's always been, and, you know, we just got to accept it, or there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:10:32.914 --> 00:10:33.735]  Yes, there is.
[00:10:35.336 --> 00:10:36.517]  You see, it's a synthesis.
[00:10:39.579 --> 00:10:43.462]  There is a diagram I've seen.
[00:10:43.502 --> 00:10:44.643]  I should put it in a film.
[00:10:45.603 --> 00:10:46.544]  It's like a wheel.
[00:10:46.644 --> 00:10:47.385]  It's a clock.
[00:10:48.806 --> 00:10:54.650]  And at 12 o'clock, at 12 o'clock, you have freedom.
[00:10:55.231 --> 00:11:06.135]  You have people who've just had a revolution, if it was a real revolution, that have just stood up against corruption, that have punished the evildoers, the purveyors of slavery.
[00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:14.819]  And then after they do that, they get prosperity, because they have freedom, and freedom always brings extreme prosperity.
[00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:20.141]  And then the next generation...
[00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:25.592]  It's a little bit complacent and happy and secure.
[00:11:28.053 --> 00:11:36.778]  And then at about 6 o'clock, they start getting decadent and laissez-faire.
[00:11:38.479 --> 00:11:45.063]  And then by about 9 o'clock, they get extreme tyranny.
[00:11:46.144 --> 00:11:47.745]  And somewhere around 11 o'clock,
[00:11:50.115 --> 00:12:05.142]  45, you have the violent revolution, or you can start it at about 9 o'clock peacefully and just move forward against the corruption if you start early enough and remove the tyranny before it metastasizes.
[00:12:07.042 --> 00:12:08.323]  And that's really the cycle.
[00:12:08.683 --> 00:12:09.904]  That's the historical cycle.
[00:12:10.584 --> 00:12:18.187]  And the problem with tyranny, which we now have, is if you don't fight it as it begins to assert itself at around 9 o'clock,
[00:12:19.415 --> 00:12:25.577]  On this clock, pretty soon there's a synthesis.
[00:12:25.937 --> 00:12:43.162]  You know, King of the Hill kicks in, King Rat, as they say, and the most ruthless, the most cunning, the most manipulative, the most hateful, the most sadistic get into control rather rapidly.
[00:12:43.303 --> 00:12:47.744]  Once you build a governmental mechanism of command and control,
[00:12:48.832 --> 00:12:51.814]  Of centralized directorate.
[00:12:53.515 --> 00:13:03.861]  Within short order, always within a generation, sometime within a matter of years, you go into full-blown, full-born tyranny.
[00:13:06.843 --> 00:13:08.664]  And then there's even another synthesis.
[00:13:09.064 --> 00:13:11.326]  You get even worse tyrants rather quickly.
[00:13:11.786 --> 00:13:14.988]  You go from a Lenin to a Stalin.
[00:13:18.197 --> 00:13:46.919]  But there is equilibrium in any society, and finally the minions that have served it, the people that have denied it, enough people get hurt by it, the unfeeling arrogance of power begins to even squash its own servants, and things rapidly race towards a type of explosive crossroads or zenith, paramount point of evil,
[00:13:47.808 --> 00:13:53.150]  And generally, then the corruption is just lessened a bit, and that's called reform.
[00:13:53.630 --> 00:14:07.634]  And more often than not, the people then labor under tyranny for generations and never escape into the liberty and freedom and never have a chance to start the cycle over again.
[00:14:07.654 --> 00:14:13.295]  And we've seen this with the Roman Empire, the golden age of the Greek Empire.
[00:14:13.996 --> 00:14:15.196]  We've seen this everywhere.
[00:14:16.317 --> 00:14:17.678]  We've seen this with the Renaissance.
[00:14:19.538 --> 00:14:25.800]  Being overtaken by mercantilism and then today, globalism, which is not free market.
[00:14:27.141 --> 00:14:28.481]  They call it capitalism.
[00:14:29.002 --> 00:14:30.742]  They confuse you with false terms.
[00:14:34.083 --> 00:14:38.025]  So if you're joining me for the first time, I just want to give you the news flash.
[00:14:41.275 --> 00:15:02.011]  Our government, the people controlling it, the private corporations controlling it, the big tax-free foundations that were set up at the turn of the last century, expressly, in their own founding documents that are public, to control us and dumb us down and centralize control, they have openly been putting cancer viruses and sterilization compounds in vaccines.
[00:15:02.692 --> 00:15:04.093]  They've openly been spraying U.S.
[00:15:04.113 --> 00:15:08.256]  cities with chemicals and biologicals since the 70s has been a congressional testimony.
[00:15:09.235 --> 00:15:15.037]  They've openly been carrying out terror attacks, admittedly, since the turn of the last century.
[00:15:15.117 --> 00:15:16.297]  By the last century, I should say.
[00:15:17.137 --> 00:15:18.057]  Again, that's incorrect.
[00:15:18.998 --> 00:15:20.778]  If I say turn of the last century, that would be 2001.
[00:15:22.358 --> 00:15:25.899]  I'm talking about, my friends, the turn of 1900.
[00:15:25.939 --> 00:15:27.180]  105 years ago.
[00:15:33.894 --> 00:15:37.756]  And don't send me emails, please, that I just said the turn of the last century in 2001.
[00:15:37.956 --> 00:15:40.858]  That was the true turn of the century.
[00:15:41.538 --> 00:15:43.339]  I know it was celebrated on 2000.
[00:15:44.099 --> 00:15:53.505]  But is 10-11, is 10 part of the next set of 10?
[00:15:54.085 --> 00:15:59.348]  Is it part of the next nine that make up a centurion?
[00:16:00.468 --> 00:16:01.589]  Okay, now I digress.
[00:16:04.557 --> 00:16:13.503]  The point here is that... Oh, man.
[00:16:13.523 --> 00:16:14.704]  I don't even know where to start.
[00:16:18.107 --> 00:16:22.710]  Again, there's hundreds of examples of this, but let me just use one.
[00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:22.930]  1980s.
[00:16:23.010 --> 00:16:28.274]  I have a young man who volunteers, a corporal.
[00:16:31.116 --> 00:16:32.537]  They say, hey, we're going to test...
[00:16:35.066 --> 00:16:38.888]  We're going to test a gas on you.
[00:16:38.908 --> 00:16:41.610]  It'll just make you pass out.
[00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:42.751]  You want to do this for your country?
[00:16:43.851 --> 00:16:45.952]  You'll get some extra to leave, some extra time off.
[00:16:45.973 --> 00:16:46.693]  You'll get promoted.
[00:16:47.193 --> 00:16:48.614]  Well, sure, I'll do that for my country.
[00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:52.376]  Young, nicely dressed young man goes into the chamber.
[00:16:52.576 --> 00:16:54.317]  They hit him with sarin nerve gas and kill him.
[00:16:55.178 --> 00:16:57.519]  They take his dead body, and they don't even give it back to the parents.
[00:16:57.559 --> 00:17:03.523]  They take big chunks of it first and parts of his organs for testing, and they ship his little dead body back to mommy and daddy.
[00:17:05.202 --> 00:17:08.283]  They do that to you.
[00:17:08.303 --> 00:17:08.283]  1949.
[00:17:09.283 --> 00:17:10.003]  New Mexico.
[00:17:11.863 --> 00:17:13.263]  Pregnant wife of a GI.
[00:17:13.283 --> 00:17:16.984]  She's really looking forward to having that first baby.
[00:17:17.004 --> 00:17:18.444]  They're wondering if it's a boy or a girl.
[00:17:19.865 --> 00:17:21.385]  Let's personalize this for a moment.
[00:17:22.785 --> 00:17:29.226]  She goes in and she gets some free health care because her husband's in the military.
[00:17:29.686 --> 00:17:30.767]  Low-level enlisted man.
[00:17:31.547 --> 00:17:33.187]  And the doctor, nice doctor, walks in.
[00:17:34.522 --> 00:17:37.685]  Of course, in the back room, there's a Nazi scientist advising them.
[00:17:38.225 --> 00:17:38.926]  This is a true story.
[00:17:39.426 --> 00:17:40.807]  He'd been in Newsweek many years ago.
[00:17:42.188 --> 00:17:45.071]  And he says, here's some vitamins for you, dear.
[00:17:45.111 --> 00:17:46.292]  Be sure and take these, okay?
[00:17:46.472 --> 00:17:48.413]  And if you have any problems, just come right back here.
[00:17:49.875 --> 00:17:58.982]  And when she comes in, she was part of hundreds of women they did this to, when she comes in having the violent miscarriage, they roll in the film cameras and even film it.
[00:18:00.363 --> 00:18:03.486]  And she never knew until 30 years later they'd killed her baby.
[00:18:05.276 --> 00:18:07.057]  Got a government that'll murder babies.
[00:18:08.338 --> 00:18:14.340]  Got a government that'll nerve gas its own troops and kill them.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:22.024]  1984, in a proving ground in Wales, over 50 U.S.
[00:18:22.084 --> 00:18:24.765]  and British soldiers were told, hey, this is gravy duty, boys.
[00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:28.507]  You just got to sit outside on top of these tanks and armored vehicles.
[00:18:28.527 --> 00:18:32.809]  We're going to have some low-flying planes fly over and spray you with some harmless smoke.
[00:18:32.829 --> 00:18:33.810]  They're doing test runs.
[00:18:34.981 --> 00:18:40.742]  Sure, they're all out there with their sack lunches, hanging out, even playing a little bit of soccer.
[00:18:41.703 --> 00:18:42.543]  In comes the jet.
[00:18:44.443 --> 00:18:45.664]  It's almost nerve gas.
[00:18:47.044 --> 00:18:47.744]  Nerve gas.
[00:18:50.065 --> 00:18:51.045]  Some died that night.
[00:18:52.906 --> 00:18:53.846]  Some died a year later.
[00:18:54.406 --> 00:18:56.526]  Some still live today with Parkinson's.
[00:18:58.147 --> 00:19:02.508]  BBC, front page last year, and they said nobody's being charged because they were ordered to do it.
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:05.681]  And you trust this government.
[00:19:07.002 --> 00:19:08.523]  You trust what they say.
[00:19:09.484 --> 00:19:10.945]  You trust what they do.
[00:19:12.486 --> 00:19:13.827]  When they're a pure synthesis of evil.
[00:19:14.447 --> 00:19:19.471]  With a bunch of useful idiots and well-meaning fools carrying this out in their compartmentalized structure.
[00:19:20.912 --> 00:19:26.336]  Let me tell the police, the firemen, the government bureaucrats, the FBI agents, the congressmen, everybody out there.
[00:19:27.236 --> 00:19:29.018]  You're not safe from this New World Order.
[00:19:29.038 --> 00:19:30.919]  I see you fools drinking Diet Coke.
[00:19:30.939 --> 00:19:32.380]  You don't even know what's in an aspartame.
[00:19:33.084 --> 00:19:34.265]  I see you drinking tap water.
[00:19:36.046 --> 00:19:39.268]  I know when the globalists release their bioweapon, a lot of your children are going to die.
[00:19:40.109 --> 00:19:45.673]  And you're still going to serve them, and still going to cry when the president's on TV posing as your savior.
[00:19:46.593 --> 00:19:47.894]  What is wrong with you?
[00:19:50.276 --> 00:19:54.479]  In 1968, they killed a bunch of New Yorkers going to work on the New York subway with a bioweapon.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.820]  This is your government.
[00:19:57.501 --> 00:19:59.722]  Psychotic, Hitlerian demons.
[00:20:02.313 --> 00:20:04.514]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:20:04.954 --> 00:20:09.317]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:20:09.577 --> 00:20:15.400]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:19.682]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:20:19.962 --> 00:20:26.005]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[00:20:26.045 --> 00:20:28.346]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:20:30.427 --> 00:20:30.687]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:30.707 --> 00:20:30.907]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.306 --> 00:21:01.966]  Hello, folks.

[00:21:52.646 --> 00:21:57.788]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[00:21:57.808 --> 00:22:01.150]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[00:22:15.277 --> 00:22:21.522]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[00:22:22.422 --> 00:22:30.528]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[00:22:31.549 --> 00:22:39.414]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:00.347 --> 00:23:05.871]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:23:06.071 --> 00:23:13.636]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Panex 2000 to the public.

[00:23:54.566 --> 00:23:58.707]  Again, your free catalog, toll-free, 888-972-4699.
[00:24:05.409 --> 00:24:10.830]  All right, Ralph, Jared, Sean, Richard, Robert, many others, your calls are coming up, well, right now, at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.191]  And then I'm going to get into, well, 18 killed and wounded, three injured,
[00:24:22.426 --> 00:24:25.789]  A dozen in Baghdad, 18 killed, three dozen wounded.
[00:24:27.009 --> 00:24:33.394]  An Israeli presents burial photos of Iran's nuclear sites to Bush.
[00:24:33.474 --> 00:24:34.815]  Sharon presented them.
[00:24:36.637 --> 00:24:43.982]  I mean, this is like a neighbor who, as you've caught robbing you before, and then they want a house sit for you, and you go, sure.
[00:24:44.823 --> 00:24:47.865]  It's Israel that gave our government a lot of the fake intelligence.
[00:24:48.806 --> 00:24:50.227]  And Bush knew full well it was fake.
[00:24:50.845 --> 00:24:52.626]  They've got a new cancer vaccine for you.
[00:24:52.647 --> 00:24:54.328]  They may want to make you take it, women.
[00:24:56.309 --> 00:25:01.934]  This is out of the new scientists and other publications.
[00:25:02.875 --> 00:25:05.577]  Go ahead and take your injection.
[00:25:05.597 --> 00:25:06.577]  You can trust your government.
[00:25:07.959 --> 00:25:09.320]  There's just so much coming up.
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:12.742]  But right now, without further ado, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[00:25:13.263 --> 00:25:14.384]  Ralph in Pennsylvania.
[00:25:14.444 --> 00:25:15.124]  Go ahead, Ralph.
[00:25:15.965 --> 00:25:16.866]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:25:17.006 --> 00:25:17.406]  Pretty good, sir.
[00:25:17.882 --> 00:25:22.405]  Okay, I've got kind of a story to tell you about the Maryland Board of Nursing.
[00:25:22.765 --> 00:25:24.586]  I'm a certified nursing assistant.
[00:25:24.626 --> 00:25:27.248]  I was married across training in the state of Tennessee.
[00:25:27.288 --> 00:25:31.270]  Of course, my certification in that state ran out at the end of November.
[00:25:32.050 --> 00:25:35.632]  But I filed a reciprocity into West Virginia.
[00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:38.254]  You're a nursing assistant.
[00:25:38.274 --> 00:25:38.714]  What happened?
[00:25:38.934 --> 00:25:42.056]  Okay, here's what's been going on with them.
[00:25:42.857 --> 00:25:46.979]  Okay, I filed a reciprocity in West Virginia, which I had no problems.
[00:25:47.902 --> 00:25:52.225]  That is, they accepted your certification in the other state?
[00:25:52.325 --> 00:25:53.986]  In West Virginia, okay?
[00:25:54.186 --> 00:25:56.547]  I want to commend the state of West Virginia for that.
[00:25:56.667 --> 00:25:57.168]  Well, great!
[00:25:57.248 --> 00:25:57.908]  That's interesting.
[00:25:57.928 --> 00:25:58.348]  Okay, yeah.
[00:25:58.769 --> 00:26:00.770]  Okay, here's the rest of the story.
[00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:12.897]  And then in September of last year, I filed a reciprocity for Maryland in deputation and everything, all the paperwork and everything, and had to send a $20 money order, okay?
[00:26:15.309 --> 00:26:17.191]  And I never heard nothing really back from them.
[00:26:17.251 --> 00:26:20.474]  And finally, in January, I called them, okay?
[00:26:21.494 --> 00:26:28.921]  And they said something about my check on a copy with my certification.
[00:26:29.061 --> 00:26:29.842]  I understand about your wallet.
[00:26:29.982 --> 00:26:30.802]  What happened, please?
[00:26:31.223 --> 00:26:32.464]  Okay, here's what happened.
[00:26:33.505 --> 00:26:43.353]  My wallet was stolen in Tennessee back in October when I was down there taking care of the rest of my business, okay, that I had to take care of.
[00:26:44.352 --> 00:26:46.853]  And then they told me this in January.
[00:26:46.893 --> 00:26:49.535]  They said they sent back my application because of that.
[00:26:50.555 --> 00:26:53.556]  And I told them, I said, well, I never received nothing in the mail.
[00:26:54.257 --> 00:26:58.939]  But just the other day, me and my fiancee, who is an LPN, she's an LPN.
[00:26:58.959 --> 00:27:00.180]  Listen, I'm begging you, sir.
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:01.060]  I do not.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.082]  Please just boil it down for me so I understand.
[00:27:05.102 --> 00:27:06.483]  You're a nursing assistant.
[00:27:06.583 --> 00:27:07.603]  Your wallet got stolen.
[00:27:07.623 --> 00:27:08.564]  How can I help you?
[00:27:08.924 --> 00:27:09.304]  Okay.
[00:27:09.744 --> 00:27:10.745]  Here's how it is, okay?
[00:27:11.978 --> 00:27:20.745]  My fiancée, she is an LPN in the state of Maryland, also in Pennsylvania, which I also have a certification now in Pennsylvania.
[00:27:21.345 --> 00:27:21.745]  Okay?
[00:27:22.066 --> 00:27:22.966]  We went Monday.
[00:27:23.066 --> 00:27:25.568]  She refiled her LPN for Maryland.
[00:27:26.189 --> 00:27:27.289]  Okay?
[00:27:27.490 --> 00:27:32.894]  And I did my breast prostate refiled again for CNA in Maryland.
[00:27:33.614 --> 00:27:37.377]  The strange thing is, of course, me never receiving nothing back,
[00:27:37.938 --> 00:27:41.360]  In September, like they said, and then I refiled this Monday.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:42.440]  You've got 30 seconds, sir.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:42.901]  Okay.
[00:27:43.381 --> 00:27:55.927]  And then I refiled Monday, and then what happened, of course, with the LPNRNs, they let them write a personal check for their fee, and then with the CNA, it's a $20 money order.
[00:27:56.368 --> 00:27:59.189]  Of course, I've been, you know, this is twice.
[00:28:00.390 --> 00:28:01.410]  So you're being scammed?
[00:28:01.450 --> 00:28:03.591]  Listen, Ralph, I appreciate your call.
[00:28:03.832 --> 00:28:06.493]  That was just three minutes, and I appreciate it, but I just...
[00:28:07.276 --> 00:28:10.679]  Government fees and fines and bad stuff happening, and I get you.
[00:28:10.939 --> 00:28:12.641]  It's very interesting, but I've got to move on.
[00:28:13.441 --> 00:28:15.383]  Jared in Texas, you're on the air, Jared.
[00:28:15.403 --> 00:28:15.923]  Go ahead.
[00:28:16.304 --> 00:28:17.124]  How's it going, Alex?
[00:28:17.144 --> 00:28:17.565]  Pretty good.
[00:28:17.825 --> 00:28:18.726]  Love your show, man.
[00:28:19.186 --> 00:28:20.487]  I really appreciate it.
[00:28:20.507 --> 00:28:22.009]  I haven't... Well, thank you for calling.
[00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.669]  What's on your mind?
[00:28:23.069 --> 00:28:23.710]  What's on my mind?
[00:28:23.770 --> 00:28:25.832]  I was driving down Lamar the other day, right?
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:34.524]  And I see a billboard and it's talking about the microchipping and how it works on pets and dogs.
[00:28:34.544 --> 00:28:37.906]  This is just so insane that people accept this crap.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.083]  Well, I mean, for animals, that's how they're conditioning us.
[00:28:43.103 --> 00:28:49.810]  And then we see articles every week where this little dog was gone for five years and was found halfway across the country thanks to its chip.
[00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:51.311]  Why don't humans all have chips?
[00:28:51.571 --> 00:28:51.812]  I know.
[00:28:51.892 --> 00:28:53.493]  John Hannity says we all need chips.
[00:28:53.754 --> 00:28:55.095]  It's just, it's insane.
[00:28:55.135 --> 00:28:58.378]  You know, they might want to save Fluffy, but I have a two-year-old daughter.
[00:28:58.398 --> 00:29:01.822]  You know, if they, you know, try to do this to her, you know, what am I going to do, you know?
[00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:03.410]  Well, you're going to say no.
[00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:05.071]  Well, of course I'm going to say no.
[00:29:05.131 --> 00:29:10.254]  And at the same time, in other areas of the country, they're making places like, what, San Francisco?
[00:29:10.294 --> 00:29:11.855]  They make you put a chip in your pit.
[00:29:12.255 --> 00:29:13.776]  That's just insane, man.
[00:29:13.796 --> 00:29:16.418]  So what do we do, you know?
[00:29:16.438 --> 00:29:16.918]  What do we do?
[00:29:16.938 --> 00:29:20.500]  We educate people, and we don't let them condition us to accept this.
[00:29:22.281 --> 00:29:22.642]  Jared?
[00:29:22.942 --> 00:29:23.122]  Yeah.
[00:29:23.877 --> 00:29:26.659]  I'm just terrified of her to start public school, you know.
[00:29:26.679 --> 00:29:29.881]  I want to homeschool, but it's... Well, I'd be a lot more worried about these vaccines.
[00:29:30.401 --> 00:29:30.661]  Yeah.
[00:29:31.122 --> 00:29:33.904]  Now, you know there's no law you have to give your daughter vaccines.
[00:29:34.204 --> 00:29:34.364]  No.
[00:29:35.104 --> 00:29:45.331]  So you need to learn that law, get all that information, and you need to work two jobs if need be and let your wife stay home and homeschool your daughter, or work three jobs and send her to private school.
[00:29:46.452 --> 00:29:47.052]  Excellent.
[00:29:47.092 --> 00:29:47.873]  Three jobs.
[00:29:48.273 --> 00:29:49.674]  You will work 18 hours a day.
[00:29:51.591 --> 00:29:52.473]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.974 --> 00:29:54.557]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.577 --> 00:29:58.183]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.093 --> 00:30:07.616]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:30:07.756 --> 00:30:08.816]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:30:08.936 --> 00:30:09.817]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:30:09.917 --> 00:30:12.778]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:30:12.958 --> 00:30:17.880]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.161]  Check out this new product.
[00:30:19.321 --> 00:30:22.202]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:30:22.582 --> 00:30:26.284]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:30:26.464 --> 00:30:28.945]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[00:30:29.185 --> 00:30:30.086]  We're good to go.
[00:30:30.126 --> 00:30:30.707]  We're good to go.
[00:30:46.087 --> 00:30:48.971]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[00:30:49.151 --> 00:30:52.035]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[00:30:52.235 --> 00:30:54.698]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[00:30:54.858 --> 00:30:58.142]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NoBO.
[00:30:58.323 --> 00:30:59.024]  That's no-bo.com.
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.301]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.381 --> 00:31:14.085]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.465 --> 00:31:18.987]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.067 --> 00:31:30.391]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.751 --> 00:31:31.472]  We're good to go.
[00:32:03.952 --> 00:32:09.433]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.853 --> 00:32:14.074]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:14.314 --> 00:32:21.356]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.736 --> 00:32:27.838]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.858 --> 00:32:29.198]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:29.358 --> 00:32:31.741]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:32:46.318 --> 00:32:49.399]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:32:49.419 --> 00:32:49.459]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.479 --> 00:32:49.559]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:50.659]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:50.719 --> 00:32:51.019]  Call today.
[00:32:51.079 --> 00:32:53.880]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.700]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:57.621]  Monday through Friday.
[00:33:14.423 --> 00:33:15.264]  From 11 a.m.
[00:33:15.304 --> 00:33:18.566]  until 2 p.m., Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:19.467 --> 00:33:21.249]  I appreciate and love all your calls.
[00:33:21.269 --> 00:33:22.850]  We're going to take a lot of calls today.
[00:33:23.631 --> 00:33:30.356]  But I really want callers to keep it down to about 90 seconds, and I'll try to keep my comments down on your calls to about 60 seconds.
[00:33:30.416 --> 00:33:31.998]  That way we get to go to more people.
[00:33:32.458 --> 00:33:37.302]  Because I get so many emails telling me that they can't ever get through on the lines.
[00:33:37.602 --> 00:33:38.263]  As soon as you hear...
[00:33:40.123 --> 00:33:41.544]  Somebody's call being completed.
[00:33:41.564 --> 00:33:42.604]  You can call in right then.
[00:33:42.624 --> 00:33:44.785]  That's a good chance for you to get into the show.
[00:33:44.805 --> 00:33:47.147]  We'd love to hear from you.
[00:33:47.167 --> 00:33:47.787]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:47.807 --> 00:33:56.332]  And we'll go to Sean and Richard and Robert and Regina and Brock and others here in just a few minutes.
[00:33:57.213 --> 00:34:00.735]  And then I'm going to get back into the news because there is a big stack here and it's all very important.
[00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:02.631]  I want to cover it.
[00:34:03.091 --> 00:34:15.959]  And you're welcome to call in about the oil prices, now down at $50 a barrel, gone down by about $9 a barrel in the last two weeks, but you're still paying record prices at the pump, and you will.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:20.062]  And the IMF says there's no oil left, we just have to accept peak oil.
[00:34:20.763 --> 00:34:25.546]  When they've found record oil fields everywhere, we have enough oil in the U.S.
[00:34:25.586 --> 00:34:28.848]  to run this country for thousands of years of current consumption.
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:46.724]  One field off the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi, one 600 square mile area, which is pretty small as square miles go, has enough oil near the surface, easy to get to, than all of humanity has used in the last 100 years.
[00:34:48.604 --> 00:34:49.064]  One area.
[00:34:49.084 --> 00:34:53.825]  There's over a 100 year oil supply in one field in Alaska.
[00:34:54.545 --> 00:34:56.626]  Over a 100 year supply for the U.S.
[00:34:57.466 --> 00:34:57.546]  at $20
[00:34:59.381 --> 00:35:01.702]  Million barrels a day.
[00:35:02.942 --> 00:35:04.563]  This is admitted!
[00:35:04.663 --> 00:35:07.344]  Congressional reports, all the studies.
[00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:09.004]  We can't drill.
[00:35:09.064 --> 00:35:09.985]  We can't have it.
[00:35:10.065 --> 00:35:12.466]  No, we have to be told how there's no oil.
[00:35:13.566 --> 00:35:14.746]  Then I got articles like this.
[00:35:14.946 --> 00:35:17.627]  Fans charged after Pope jeering.
[00:35:18.968 --> 00:35:22.909]  Six people booed during a minute of silence for Pope John Paul II.
[00:35:23.729 --> 00:35:28.091]  And regardless of whether you're a Catholic or not, people out there,
[00:35:29.991 --> 00:35:35.852]  Whether you think this is untasteful or distasteful or not, it's people's free speech right.
[00:35:36.292 --> 00:35:38.313]  But they've been arrested and charged as hate criminals.
[00:35:40.313 --> 00:35:42.953]  And I have a whole stack of news along the same line.
[00:35:43.013 --> 00:35:46.434]  Radio host fired for wondering if Pope went to heaven.
[00:35:48.054 --> 00:35:50.875]  And it was on Word FM in Pittsburgh.
[00:35:50.895 --> 00:35:53.375]  I've actually been on that station as a guest many times.
[00:35:54.395 --> 00:35:57.416]  And the host, Marty Minto, 39...
[00:35:59.088 --> 00:36:03.690]  A senior pastor at New Castle Church, a caller said, I wonder if the Pope went to heaven.
[00:36:03.710 --> 00:36:06.111]  He said, yeah, I wonder too, and was fired.
[00:36:06.131 --> 00:36:09.992]  So that's kind of self-censorship and enforcement going on.
[00:36:10.032 --> 00:36:19.876]  Again, I'm not a Catholic, folks, but I have a lot of Catholic friends, and I think it's distasteful to boo during a moment of silence at a soccer game in Scotland.
[00:36:21.076 --> 00:36:24.578]  But you don't charge people with serious crimes for it.
[00:36:25.958 --> 00:36:27.419]  This is how hate speech works.
[00:36:29.625 --> 00:36:31.746]  There's always some group most people don't like.
[00:36:32.647 --> 00:36:38.310]  And then they do something, and then the government violates their free speech, and we go, all right, yay!
[00:36:38.590 --> 00:36:39.671]  But then it happens to us.
[00:36:40.672 --> 00:36:44.954]  The leftists love it when a pro-gun rally gets shut down and people get arrested.
[00:36:45.895 --> 00:36:52.859]  They love it when Christians protesting a homosexual rally peacefully, just praying, get arrested and charged as being terrorists.
[00:36:52.999 --> 00:36:58.202]  Remember, they almost got 45 years in prison apiece, but that case did get dropped thanks to incredible pressure.
[00:36:59.767 --> 00:37:02.149]  But then they get upset when Bush arrests people.
[00:37:02.189 --> 00:37:10.796]  You know, they'll have 500 Bush supporters, one guy with a sign that says, no blood for oil, that's a real case, in North Carolina, and they give him six months in federal prison.
[00:37:11.797 --> 00:37:13.798]  Communities two-year federal sentence down to six months.
[00:37:14.339 --> 00:37:17.441]  Because they said, well, we tell you where you can protest and where you can't.
[00:37:17.802 --> 00:37:23.126]  Or the guy wears a shirt saying, peace on earth, and the security guard thinks it's an anti-war shirt.
[00:37:23.246 --> 00:37:29.211]  The guy bought it at the mall, a city lawyer, an upstanding member of the community, and he...
[00:37:30.504 --> 00:37:31.204]  They arrested him.
[00:37:31.244 --> 00:37:32.245]  They just said, take the shirt off.
[00:37:32.265 --> 00:37:33.867]  He said, I can't walk around without a shirt.
[00:37:34.868 --> 00:37:36.230]  And they said, okay, you're arrested.
[00:37:38.152 --> 00:37:40.674]  Again, they're violating everybody's freedom.
[00:37:41.776 --> 00:37:42.917]  And that's how freedom works.
[00:37:42.977 --> 00:37:46.340]  Either we all hang together or we'll all hang separate.
[00:37:47.161 --> 00:37:50.525]  But before we go, right back to your calls in a Blitzkrieg fashion.
[00:37:52.122 --> 00:37:53.943]  We have a bunch of new t-shirts.
[00:37:53.983 --> 00:37:55.724]  We have women's tank tops.
[00:37:55.884 --> 00:38:07.372]  Really nice designer, made in America, close-fitting women's tank tops for this summer that just say InfoWars.com across the chest.
[00:38:09.213 --> 00:38:09.873]  Very nice.
[00:38:11.334 --> 00:38:09.873]  1995.
[00:38:12.035 --> 00:38:16.297]  We also, a way to get the word out in an unobtrusive, unobnoxious fashion.
[00:38:16.818 --> 00:38:20.420]  And you'll meet a lot of like-minded people wearing this InfoWars.com shirt.
[00:38:21.354 --> 00:38:23.775]  We have the men's shirt across the chest.
[00:38:24.596 --> 00:38:30.699]  It says, In a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:38:31.299 --> 00:38:32.020]  And we give credit.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.140]  George Arwell under that.
[00:38:33.220 --> 00:38:38.643]  On the back, it says, LearnTheTruthInfoWars.com Great way to meet people.
[00:38:38.683 --> 00:38:39.964]  Great way to get the word out.
[00:38:40.664 --> 00:38:41.945]  We have that in black and white.
[00:38:42.686 --> 00:38:46.549]  And medium, large, extra large, extra extra large.
[00:38:47.109 --> 00:38:48.890]  And these are a little bit more tight fitting.
[00:38:48.970 --> 00:38:50.651]  These are kind of designer t-shirts.
[00:38:50.671 --> 00:38:53.693]  They're not like the big stuff you buy from Mexico or China that are real baggy.
[00:38:54.114 --> 00:38:56.255]  So if you normally wear a large, you'll want an extra large.
[00:38:57.056 --> 00:38:59.858]  Normally wear an extra large, you'll want an extra extra large.
[00:39:00.158 --> 00:39:01.038]  Kind of works like that.
[00:39:02.679 --> 00:39:04.421]  The shirt is made in America.
[00:39:05.922 --> 00:39:08.824]  We have this anti-Arnold Schwarzenegger shirt.
[00:39:09.564 --> 00:39:12.346]  And it says this shirt is made in America, but Arnold wasn't.
[00:39:13.414 --> 00:39:18.379]  Still, there are those who would amend the Constitution to make it possible for Arnold to run for President.
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:26.306]  And on the shirt, again, it's a great-looking, 100% sweatshop-free.
[00:39:27.267 --> 00:39:29.469]  The cotton's grown in America.
[00:39:29.529 --> 00:39:31.070]  The shirt's sewn in America.
[00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:32.852]  It's made right here in Austin.
[00:39:33.392 --> 00:39:36.094]  That's why an extra, extra large costs us like $8-plus.
[00:39:37.661 --> 00:39:41.703]  We could get them for like $3 from Mexico, but I'm just not doing it.
[00:39:41.743 --> 00:39:43.204]  I still sell it for $19.95.
[00:39:43.844 --> 00:39:49.827]  Again, Infowars.com is proud to offer this great-looking 100% sweatshop 3 Made in America t-shirt.
[00:39:50.627 --> 00:39:56.510]  The front features a dramatic close-up graphic of Arnold with Obey right under it.
[00:39:56.630 --> 00:40:01.693]  Arnold's image is surrounded by a scrolling text box that says, Resist Arnold the Invader.
[00:40:02.353 --> 00:40:06.294]  ArnoldExposed.com and Infowars.com are printed below the graphic.
[00:40:06.434 --> 00:40:16.517]  On back, no Arnold for President is written above ArnoldExposed.com and Infowars.com inside a striking red box background.
[00:40:18.538 --> 00:40:20.538]  And you really need to get that shirt.
[00:40:20.878 --> 00:40:23.479]  Brand new, just got it printed, just got them in.
[00:40:24.459 --> 00:40:26.740]  And I never really promote the other t-shirts we've got.
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.461]  The anti-gun control t-shirt we've got.
[00:40:30.481 --> 00:40:32.661]  The maternity response team t-shirt we've got.
[00:40:34.962 --> 00:40:38.483]  About half the time, they were sewn in America.
[00:40:40.143 --> 00:40:41.844]  The other half the time, they're from Mexico.
[00:40:43.144 --> 00:40:50.226]  They are printed and silk-screened right here in Austin in a non-sweatshop environment.
[00:40:50.606 --> 00:40:52.566]  Though in my next batch, because I just learned this.
[00:40:52.586 --> 00:40:53.846]  I thought it was made in America.
[00:40:54.587 --> 00:40:55.707]  The shirt's been selling for years.
[00:40:56.508 --> 00:41:02.369]  Somebody pointed it out, that the company doing it has a factory in Texas and a factory in Mexico.
[00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:04.850]  So I'm told half the time it's one, half the time it's other.
[00:41:05.230 --> 00:41:06.550]  Not with these other new shirts.
[00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:07.871]  They're all made in America.
[00:41:08.391 --> 00:41:11.792]  But next batch, with the old shirts, I'm having them all made in America.
[00:41:13.172 --> 00:41:14.172]  Okay, enough on that.
[00:41:15.153 --> 00:41:23.475]  Lastly, before I go to your calls, on this plug here, my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State is out.
[00:41:23.515 --> 00:41:25.315]  It is the most powerful film I've ever made.
[00:41:26.443 --> 00:41:27.704]  It is three films in one.
[00:41:27.724 --> 00:41:34.970]  The DVD is roughly, well, not roughly, it's three hours, I don't know, 40-something seconds long, I forget.
[00:41:36.311 --> 00:41:37.552]  And it's over three hours.
[00:41:37.592 --> 00:41:39.994]  The VHS is two hours, 35 minutes.
[00:41:40.194 --> 00:41:40.935]  It is amazing.
[00:41:41.576 --> 00:41:42.637]  One hour is about 9-11.
[00:41:44.099 --> 00:41:46.060]  We confront Michael Moore as a whitewasher.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.622]  We go over what really happened on 9-11.
[00:41:48.642 --> 00:41:49.322]  We go over Building 7.
[00:41:50.663 --> 00:41:52.004]  I can't go over it all.
[00:41:52.484 --> 00:41:54.605]  We go over the latest police state information.
[00:41:54.645 --> 00:41:59.808]  We cover the Nazi-Bush-Schwarzenegger connection and the order of death, the skull and bones, Bohemian Grove.
[00:42:00.448 --> 00:42:01.309]  It's powerful.
[00:42:01.369 --> 00:42:02.229]  You need to have it.
[00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:05.211]  And we've got a bunch of other discounts going on the other films as well.
[00:42:05.952 --> 00:42:08.213]  I'm just still offering that special because people like it.
[00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:16.815]  You can get this new film as low as $14 a piece when you get them in bulk, or $25.95 individually.
[00:42:17.216 --> 00:42:23.582]  You can get one of my last films as low as $5.95 when you order multiple copies on DVD.
[00:42:23.682 --> 00:42:25.263]  I just want to get it out.
[00:42:25.483 --> 00:42:26.504]  That's American Dictators.
[00:42:26.564 --> 00:42:27.045]  It's excellent.
[00:42:28.268 --> 00:42:32.531]  If you're confused by all those specials, just give the operators a call, and they'll give you all the details.
[00:42:32.551 --> 00:42:33.132]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:42:33.152 --> 00:42:33.352]  888-253-3139.
[00:42:33.372 --> 00:42:39.176]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:42:39.357 --> 00:42:43.780]  Or order via the safe, secure online shopping carts at InfoWars.com.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:44.500]  Please get the new film.
[00:42:44.560 --> 00:42:45.701]  Please make copies of it.
[00:42:57.574 --> 00:43:00.575]  It's really having an effect, and I want to thank those that have gotten it.
[00:43:01.335 --> 00:43:03.795]  We got the DVD in a few weeks ago, a week and a half ago.
[00:43:03.835 --> 00:43:04.856]  It's been shipping out to you.
[00:43:06.256 --> 00:43:12.477]  All right, that's enough ranting about products, but all my products are about waking people up, and they're the best out there.
[00:43:13.497 --> 00:43:15.898]  Sean in Alabama, thanks for holding your on the air.
[00:43:16.558 --> 00:43:17.238]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:43:17.278 --> 00:43:18.219]  It's nice to talk to you.
[00:43:18.399 --> 00:43:19.179]  Nice to talk to you.
[00:43:19.859 --> 00:43:24.780]  Just real quick, I wanted to make a comment about Professor Christensen and talk about a letter I got from my senator.
[00:43:26.259 --> 00:43:36.595]  Just to show how ridiculous the left-right paradigm in this country is, I googled Professor Christensen's name yesterday, and within the first ten links, she's being accused of being both
[00:43:37.485 --> 00:43:41.367]  A left-wing liberal wacko and a right-wing conservative nutjob.
[00:43:42.008 --> 00:43:44.689]  How can she be both unless there's no difference between the two?
[00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:48.191]  For those that missed yesterday's broadcast, fill them in.
[00:43:48.411 --> 00:43:58.617]  Basically, she's teaching an upper-level political science course called 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, I believe is what she calls borrowing the title of your movie.
[00:43:59.657 --> 00:44:06.001]  And she's showing various movies, so-called conspiracy theory movies about...
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:09.702]  Which is crazy because if you Google Jews against Zionism...
[00:44:30.820 --> 00:44:35.423]  There's a plethora, I mean, there's multitudes of Jews who are against Zionism.
[00:44:35.443 --> 00:44:47.711]  Well, I mean, major Israeli papers have reported that Israel's bracing for civil war, and that now it looks like it's over half their population is against the Zionists, so I guess all those Jews are anti-Semitic too.
[00:44:47.992 --> 00:44:48.972]  Yeah, what a shocker, huh?
[00:44:49.392 --> 00:44:51.374]  It's nothing but a demonization term.
[00:44:51.794 --> 00:44:52.354]  Exactly.
[00:44:53.255 --> 00:44:57.718]  All she does on her website, I've read the articles that demonize her, all she does is link
[00:44:58.559 --> 00:45:10.870]  To United Press International and Haratz and other papers, news wires, that have reported that Sharon said he'll kill American citizens in America if he wants to.
[00:45:11.590 --> 00:45:14.133]  And she's linked to the quotes where he says he owns our Congress.
[00:45:14.873 --> 00:45:18.717]  Now, you know, he said that, he did that, and that's wrong.
[00:45:18.777 --> 00:45:19.417]  Thanks for the call.
[00:45:20.438 --> 00:45:21.359]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:45:21.379 --> 00:45:24.441]  Just real quick about the immigration letter I got from my senator.
[00:45:24.461 --> 00:45:24.582]  Yes.
[00:45:26.602 --> 00:45:34.328]  I wrote him asking, you know, why is it that how can you claim to keep this country safe when our borders are wide open?
[00:45:35.269 --> 00:45:42.115]  And long story short, the letter he wrote me back, the closest he gets to talking about the government controlling our borders
[00:45:42.817 --> 00:45:45.159]  Is, quote, making it harder to enter the U.S.
[00:45:45.219 --> 00:45:48.661]  with false documents by requiring biometric identifiers.
[00:45:48.981 --> 00:45:55.926]  Which is only used on us, not on the border crossers where the government in those bills accepts their fake consular cards.
[00:45:55.946 --> 00:45:56.506]  Thanks for the call.
[00:45:56.627 --> 00:45:56.907]  Okay.
[00:45:57.067 --> 00:45:57.967]  Yeah, it's a total scam.
[00:45:57.987 --> 00:45:58.668]  You're right, Sean.
[00:45:58.928 --> 00:45:59.769]  Richard in Texas.
[00:45:59.829 --> 00:46:00.549]  Richard, go ahead.
[00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.451]  Hey, Alex.
[00:46:02.751 --> 00:46:02.991]  Yes, sir.
[00:46:03.914 --> 00:46:05.155]  Yes, I had a question for you.
[00:46:05.235 --> 00:46:09.499]  If you knew anything about the Fuji Blimp that has been flying around Austin?
[00:46:10.099 --> 00:46:15.604]  You know, that's why I get so frustrated on this broadcast, is I never have time to talk about all of it.
[00:46:18.847 --> 00:46:22.770]  It's just absolutely out of control.
[00:46:22.790 --> 00:46:27.735]  I tried to chase it yesterday.
[00:46:29.159 --> 00:46:30.460]  It was flying over downtown.
[00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:31.661]  I couldn't read the writing.
[00:46:31.701 --> 00:46:33.962]  I think it said something about law enforcement on it.
[00:46:34.563 --> 00:46:36.344]  And yeah, it's flying around.
[00:46:37.465 --> 00:46:41.208]  We know in my film, Martial Law, it's got NYPD on it spying on people.
[00:46:41.908 --> 00:46:44.009]  But yes, it was flying around yesterday.
[00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:45.491]  Oh, okay.
[00:46:45.531 --> 00:46:46.451]  And one more thing.
[00:46:46.551 --> 00:46:48.893]  Can we purchase your videos in person here?
[00:46:51.474 --> 00:47:00.139]  I don't know if Bob Dacey with the Hardware Store Incorporated at Spicewood Springs Road 183 in North Austin has gotten some yet, but I know he carries my videos.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:01.180]  Okay.
[00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:02.221]  Appreciate it, Alex.
[00:47:02.261 --> 00:47:03.021]  Keep up the good work.
[00:47:03.401 --> 00:47:04.402]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:47:04.422 --> 00:47:06.883]  Were you able to read the black text under Fuji?
[00:47:07.884 --> 00:47:11.366]  It said something about applied digital science or something like that.
[00:47:11.386 --> 00:47:12.527]  I couldn't really make it out.
[00:47:12.907 --> 00:47:13.547]  You're joking.
[00:47:14.187 --> 00:47:14.428]  No.
[00:47:15.468 --> 00:47:16.709]  It said applied digital.
[00:47:17.279 --> 00:47:18.760]  Something digital.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:24.442]  I read digital, but I was driving the opposite way, so I caught digital, though.
[00:47:24.822 --> 00:47:25.702]  Well, thank you for the call.
[00:47:26.622 --> 00:47:29.543]  Yeah, it may just be out advertising.
[00:47:29.563 --> 00:47:34.125]  I saw something about enforcement, but it was probably two miles away from me.
[00:47:35.045 --> 00:47:39.227]  I got pretty good eyes, but I couldn't make out exactly, and I didn't have time to chase it around forever.
[00:47:39.247 --> 00:47:45.849]  That was downtown, and it was kind of uptown, down over the university, and I was downtown.
[00:47:47.139 --> 00:47:48.540]  And yeah, it was flying around.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:49.601]  I don't know what's going on.
[00:47:50.381 --> 00:47:55.705]  I mean, probably just doing advertising like it has in the past, but in New York it wasn't.
[00:47:55.845 --> 00:47:58.226]  It was flying around scanning people.
[00:47:58.807 --> 00:47:59.547]  That was admitted.
[00:48:00.148 --> 00:48:02.589]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Colorado.
[00:48:02.629 --> 00:48:03.330]  Robert, go ahead.
[00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:04.571]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[00:48:04.611 --> 00:48:05.411]  Nice to take my call.
[00:48:05.431 --> 00:48:06.032]  Appreciate it.
[00:48:06.072 --> 00:48:06.892]  Thanks for calling me.
[00:48:07.372 --> 00:48:07.793]  Sure.
[00:48:07.853 --> 00:48:08.733]  Great show as always.
[00:48:09.014 --> 00:48:10.515]  I really enjoy your 20- and 30-minute docs.
[00:48:10.535 --> 00:48:12.216]  I was learning something from those.
[00:48:13.805 --> 00:48:22.491]  You talked to Barry Rudolph earlier in the broadcast, the evicted bomber who admitted to the bombing in the Atlanta Olympics and so forth.
[00:48:22.511 --> 00:48:31.657]  Do you think he's somehow connected to the government at all, or is it just... No, from all the evidence I've got, he's totally innocent.
[00:48:32.918 --> 00:48:34.539]  Oh, you don't think he's connected to the bombing at all?
[00:48:34.879 --> 00:48:36.340]  No, he didn't bomb those clinics.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:37.300]  The feds did.
[00:48:38.221 --> 00:48:38.541]  Really?
[00:48:38.821 --> 00:48:40.843]  And they just picked him to depend on someone?
[00:48:41.043 --> 00:48:42.344]  He's the third person they picked.
[00:48:42.524 --> 00:48:42.704]  Yeah.
[00:48:43.490 --> 00:48:44.191]  Oh, yeah, you're right.
[00:48:44.271 --> 00:48:47.033]  At first they tried to hang the security guard.
[00:48:47.714 --> 00:48:48.454]  Richard Jewell.
[00:48:48.494 --> 00:48:50.416]  Then there was another guy.
[00:48:50.436 --> 00:48:52.097]  I see what you mean.
[00:48:52.138 --> 00:48:55.500]  And Richard Jewell said they threatened him and said, you better plead guilty or we're going to execute you.
[00:48:55.961 --> 00:48:56.561]  He said, no!
[00:48:57.842 --> 00:48:59.304]  Listen, you know why they went after Jewell?
[00:49:00.725 --> 00:49:05.189]  Jewell saw a well-known BATF officer leave the backpack.
[00:49:05.229 --> 00:49:07.451]  This has been in mainstream news, but never national news.
[00:49:08.051 --> 00:49:11.234]  The BATF was out there as usual, just like they bombed Oklahoma City.
[00:49:12.139 --> 00:49:13.945]  And that's a whole other story, folks.
[00:49:14.066 --> 00:49:14.949]  I've made a film about it.
[00:49:14.969 --> 00:49:16.092]  Yes, you did.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:29.687]  So, you know, I mean, the year before they were, quote, blowing up rider trucks in the Arizona desert as part of a secretly funded congressional program.
[00:49:30.007 --> 00:49:43.696]  But with Jewell, the Olympic Park was a government bombing to get more funding, and Jewell was a security guard and saw it, so they tried to frame him, and they tried to frame somebody else, and then poor Rudolph, they tried to blame him, so he went into hiding.
[00:49:45.143 --> 00:49:52.589]  And then to make you think it's real, oh, he tells us this is where the dynamite is, but we had to blow it up in place because it was so dangerous.
[00:49:53.350 --> 00:49:57.594]  And this is what, look, sir, the FBI crime lab has been caught framing thousands.
[00:49:58.574 --> 00:49:58.855]  Okay?
[00:49:59.075 --> 00:50:03.158]  We've caught the BATF and FBI burying pipe bombs on people's property in Michigan.
[00:50:03.959 --> 00:50:12.326]  You cannot trust anything they do, and there's a hundred pieces of evidence that I meant to cover, a couple of them later, literally, but this is a total frame-up.
[00:50:13.706 --> 00:50:14.566]  Hmm, interesting.
[00:50:15.107 --> 00:50:18.108]  We had a real interesting article... Rudolph, when he was in hiding, told people this.
[00:50:18.528 --> 00:50:19.168]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:50:19.788 --> 00:50:20.589]  Oh, yeah, thanks, man.
[00:50:20.689 --> 00:50:21.409]  I appreciate that.
[00:50:22.129 --> 00:50:22.810]  One other quick point.
[00:50:22.830 --> 00:50:27.932]  We had a real interesting article on prisonplan.tv, I think, by a sports writer out in D.C.
[00:50:27.972 --> 00:50:32.874]  talking about the Washington Nationals team playing at RFA Stadium.
[00:50:33.294 --> 00:50:33.534]  Yes.
[00:50:33.594 --> 00:50:35.835]  And the naming rights have been sold to the National Guard.
[00:50:37.006 --> 00:50:42.292]  And according to him, the National Guard is going to kind of set up, I guess, a recruiting booth or whatever.
[00:50:42.312 --> 00:50:44.073]  Oh, yeah.
[00:50:44.133 --> 00:50:46.996]  And then Bush yesterday, quote, honored the Patriots.
[00:50:47.016 --> 00:50:48.238]  And I'll talk about that when we get back.
[00:50:48.838 --> 00:50:51.381]  Again, every caller raises points I'm meant to cover.
[00:50:52.102 --> 00:50:54.664]  All the time I think about the stuff I want to talk about and then I forget about it.
[00:50:54.684 --> 00:50:56.566]  Then you call in and mention it and I remember it.
[00:50:56.947 --> 00:50:58.808]  I want to talk about those two points when we get back.
[00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:59.149]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.289 --> 00:51:02.810]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.010 --> 00:51:06.072]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.212 --> 00:51:10.114]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.154 --> 00:51:14.396]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.736 --> 00:51:18.518]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.598 --> 00:51:20.459]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:23.902 --> 00:51:28.706]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.866 --> 00:51:31.929]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:51:32.089 --> 00:51:34.971]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.452 --> 00:51:41.557]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.097 --> 00:51:43.939]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:00.712 --> 00:52:04.614]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:04.834 --> 00:52:10.277]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:10.558 --> 00:52:20.923]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.084 --> 00:52:25.426]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:25.626 --> 00:52:33.949]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:34.229 --> 00:52:40.572]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul-faced like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[00:54:06.036 --> 00:54:07.937]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.398 --> 00:54:11.260]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:17.344 --> 00:54:21.307]  It's called propaganda placement instead of product placement.
[00:54:22.288 --> 00:54:35.497]  So instead of a private company like Nextel or Exxon buying the rights to the stadium and being able to propagandize for their products, which is fine,
[00:54:36.859 --> 00:54:38.260]  It's going to be the government.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:55:04.781]  Hundreds of millions of dollars per program with fake newscasts, hundreds of millions in money for fake reporters, fake grassroots organizations to testify in front of fake independent commissions, where you have the actual criminals stealing elections, sitting on the election commission as the chairman with, you know, chairman of the Republican Party and sub-chairman, acting like it's a grassroots organization, you know, testifying.
[00:55:04.841 --> 00:55:06.302]  I mean, it's a joke.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:11.422]  And then the news doesn't point any of that out when they call it independent commissions.
[00:55:12.102 --> 00:55:16.965]  And so, yeah, I mean, already they've got the troops all over the schools, I mean, cornering children.
[00:55:17.445 --> 00:55:19.647]  They passed a law a year and a half ago so they could do it.
[00:55:20.147 --> 00:55:27.672]  Cornering them without the parents even knowing, trying to get them to sign documents, to join the propagandas everywhere.
[00:55:28.972 --> 00:55:33.595]  But that's nothing compared to... No president that I know of has ever had a press conference.
[00:55:34.876 --> 00:55:36.617]  I'm here to honor the patriots.
[00:55:37.961 --> 00:55:41.122]  And I've got the Patriots behind me here.
[00:55:41.682 --> 00:55:44.183]  And again, the message is, I'm patriotic.
[00:55:45.323 --> 00:55:52.066]  Folks, the White House released the list of the 250 playlists of what Bush listens to on his iPod.
[00:55:52.926 --> 00:55:57.027]  And they picked, basically, it's been noticed, the 250 most popular bands.
[00:55:57.627 --> 00:56:03.629]  So people hear the bands Bush likes and they associate, they personalize it with Bush.
[00:56:03.669 --> 00:56:05.210]  I mean, the White House released that list.
[00:56:06.269 --> 00:56:10.210]  Purely to personalize him and to make you think of him as a regular guy.
[00:56:11.811 --> 00:56:15.032]  You know, to have a psychological association with him.
[00:56:15.092 --> 00:56:16.813]  Oh, I like that band, too.
[00:56:17.133 --> 00:56:19.113]  Oh, I like that country group.
[00:56:19.213 --> 00:56:21.994]  Oh, I like that rock and roll group.
[00:56:22.255 --> 00:56:23.475]  Oh, Bush is pretty cool.
[00:56:24.595 --> 00:56:26.976]  And, I mean, what do you think he has the patriots there for?
[00:56:27.056 --> 00:56:32.118]  I'm here to acknowledge your patriotism and your stalwart leadership as patriots.
[00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:35.330]  This is news, all over the news yesterday.
[00:56:35.390 --> 00:56:36.931]  He's with the Patriots.
[00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:38.431]  He's patriotic.
[00:56:39.352 --> 00:56:43.513]  And Bush lands by Air Force One helicopter, you know, at the NASCAR.
[00:56:43.573 --> 00:56:45.934]  I want to say you're doing a great job at NASCAR.
[00:56:46.335 --> 00:56:48.095]  You know, 45 million people watching.
[00:56:48.115 --> 00:56:49.036]  Well, I like him.
[00:56:49.056 --> 00:56:50.296]  He likes NASCAR.
[00:56:52.637 --> 00:56:56.939]  I don't care if he wants open borders and wants to appoint people that are anti-gun.
[00:56:56.979 --> 00:56:59.020]  Hell, I'll turn my guns in.
[00:56:59.060 --> 00:57:00.240]  He's for NASCAR.
[00:57:00.901 --> 00:57:01.501]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:57:03.783 --> 00:57:05.103]  Form over substance.
[00:57:06.324 --> 00:57:07.944]  And you're going to see more and more of this.
[00:57:09.384 --> 00:57:17.506]  And something I never really got to yesterday that I will spend at least 10 minutes on in the next hour is Clinton finds his surrogate family.
[00:57:19.126 --> 00:57:20.026]  His new father.
[00:57:20.106 --> 00:57:22.767]  His father died before he was born.
[00:57:23.667 --> 00:57:24.967]  He never met his father.
[00:57:24.987 --> 00:57:28.108]  His new father is George Herbert Walker Bush.
[00:57:28.968 --> 00:57:29.908]  That's his daddy.
[00:57:30.569 --> 00:57:32.129]  They're always together now.
[00:57:32.904 --> 00:57:34.125]  They vacationed together.
[00:57:34.145 --> 00:57:35.625]  They always did, folks.
[00:57:36.786 --> 00:57:38.846]  I mean, Clinton was a great governor for 12 years.
[00:57:40.327 --> 00:57:44.329]  Over $100 million a week in cocaine money out of that one airport.
[00:57:44.369 --> 00:57:45.869]  They are good friends.
[00:57:47.070 --> 00:57:48.550]  They are such good friends.
[00:57:50.051 --> 00:57:56.094]  And Clinton says to Bush, I just can't believe you've got a $2.6 trillion budget.
[00:57:56.114 --> 00:57:58.695]  One of my biggest was $1.8 trillion.
[00:57:58.735 --> 00:57:59.535]  That's not counting...
[00:58:03.297 --> 00:58:05.879]  That's not counting the $600 billion that's off budget.
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:09.321]  Over... What is it?
[00:58:09.341 --> 00:58:10.902]  $3.2 trillion, Bush?
[00:58:11.702 --> 00:58:14.484]  That's over $1,300,000,000,000,000,000 bigger than mine.
[00:58:14.885 --> 00:58:16.365]  You're absolutely amazing.
[00:58:17.126 --> 00:58:18.367]  They call you conservative.
[00:58:19.047 --> 00:58:20.228]  I just love you.
[00:58:20.568 --> 00:58:21.469]  Oh, daddy.
[00:58:22.649 --> 00:58:23.290]  Daddy.
[00:58:23.770 --> 00:58:24.331]  Brother.
[00:58:25.832 --> 00:58:27.292]  George W. is my brother.
[00:58:28.273 --> 00:58:29.074]  And George Sr.
[00:58:29.134 --> 00:58:30.014]  is my daddy.
[00:58:30.074 --> 00:58:31.955]  It actually says, my daddy.
[00:58:32.396 --> 00:58:32.516]  Oh...
[00:58:35.247 --> 00:58:38.728]  Remember when he gave David Rockefeller the Freedom Award, the National Medal?
[00:58:39.789 --> 00:58:43.750]  He said, there were only two people back in 1969 who thought I could be president.
[00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:46.291]  My mom, David Rockefeller.
[00:58:46.871 --> 00:58:47.852]  Uncle Rockefeller.
[00:58:48.072 --> 00:58:51.293]  I love you.
[00:58:51.333 --> 00:58:58.195]  Introducing... Big Brother.
[00:58:58.856 --> 00:58:59.816]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:00.618 --> 00:59:01.699]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:03.200]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.961 --> 00:59:04.882]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.902 --> 00:59:09.185]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.705 --> 00:59:13.809]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.871 --> 00:59:22.976]  All right, 25 seconds into hour number two of worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:59:23.096 --> 00:59:24.157]  I am your info-warrior.
[00:59:25.521 --> 00:59:31.563]  I'm Alex Jones, and I love humanity and freedom, and I hate tyranny, and I hope you'll join me in the fight for freedom.
[00:59:33.664 --> 00:59:46.869]  All right, we are now into hour number two, and there is a plethora, a cornucopia, a verifiable jungle of navigable information that I wish to cover.
[00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:50.951]  Hate crimes going on for booing at soccer games,
[00:59:52.857 --> 01:00:00.939]  IMF seeing price for even higher prices at the pump, even if oil is lower in price than it was just two weeks ago.
[01:00:02.899 --> 01:00:09.100]  Israel has now had its war meeting with Lord Bush, its war summit, its war council.
[01:00:11.281 --> 01:00:16.382]  It's giving us more intelligence we can trust, just like they did two and a half years ago on the evil Gulf War II.
[01:00:18.596 --> 01:00:23.138]  In the bullying of a third world dustbin with 1950s era weapons.
[01:00:23.198 --> 01:00:23.998]  We're real tough.
[01:00:25.199 --> 01:00:26.619]  That is coming up.
[01:00:26.639 --> 01:00:27.439]  There's just so much.
[01:00:27.479 --> 01:00:29.180]  But let's just right now go back to your calls.
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.200]  And I want to get into Bill Clinton.
[01:00:31.481 --> 01:00:34.882]  Bill Clinton and his surrogate family.
[01:00:34.902 --> 01:00:36.083]  That's right.
[01:00:36.103 --> 01:00:38.644]  Bill Clinton has found his surrogate family.
[01:00:38.704 --> 01:00:40.264]  I didn't give proper justice to this.
[01:00:40.924 --> 01:00:41.905]  Proper time to this.
[01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:44.826]  Didn't do justice to this, proper term.
[01:00:46.105 --> 01:00:47.966]  Yesterday, and so I'll cover it coming up.
[01:00:47.986 --> 01:00:52.590]  But right now, right now, let's go to Regina in Pennsylvania.
[01:00:52.610 --> 01:00:53.551]  Regina, welcome.
[01:00:53.971 --> 01:00:54.531]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:55.412]  Hello.
[01:00:55.752 --> 01:01:04.139]  Hey, your martial law is eye-opening, and your eyes open, and you see more information, and you have to share it.
[01:01:04.159 --> 01:01:06.341]  So hopefully I'll do all right.
[01:01:06.461 --> 01:01:07.342]  Oh, you got the video?
[01:01:07.362 --> 01:01:08.443]  Well, thank you for the support.
[01:01:08.683 --> 01:01:08.943]  Yes.
[01:01:09.103 --> 01:01:10.705]  Yeah, it's...
[01:01:12.682 --> 01:01:19.547]  It's unbelievable, but even today, your show, what you're bringing up about Israel and all that stuff, you know, I mean, it's just... Who are these people?
[01:01:19.808 --> 01:01:21.149]  What are they doing to us?
[01:01:21.189 --> 01:01:31.997]  I just want to explain to you, John Hamill, I don't know if you're familiar with John Hamill, from the IHF.com, the International Alliance for Health Freedom.
[01:01:32.557 --> 01:01:32.657]  Yes.
[01:01:32.697 --> 01:01:35.860]  And what he's been fighting with the... Codex Alimentarius.
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:36.380]  Right.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.783]  He'd like to get on your show, if that would be possible, Alex, because...
[01:01:40.430 --> 01:01:48.574]  Talking to him, the Free Trade of America, which I understand this month, we're supposed to have hearings... That's the regulatory trigger to go under EU rules.
[01:01:48.855 --> 01:01:49.735]  Right, exactly.
[01:01:49.755 --> 01:01:52.116]  For those who don't know... Well, go ahead.
[01:01:53.017 --> 01:01:54.718]  Well, you seem like you already know.
[01:01:54.978 --> 01:02:00.681]  My main thing is that we have Ron Paul here trying to bring up the H.J.
[01:02:00.721 --> 01:02:08.065]  Resolution 27 to withdraw us from the WTO, knowing that the... But Bush likes the Patriots, so it's okay.
[01:02:10.111 --> 01:02:17.818]  I know that, Alex, but I'm not, you know, I didn't vote for Bush, and I know that... But, I mean, he likes NASCAR, so he wants our guns.
[01:02:18.418 --> 01:02:21.120]  So we're going to be under the EU when they pass this.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:23.082]  So, I mean, but he likes football.
[01:02:23.102 --> 01:02:23.962]  He's got to be good.
[01:02:23.982 --> 01:02:33.210]  Yeah, but, you know, even like with this invasive species policies and things like that, you know... So they want to start hunting your house cat if it goes outdoors in Wisconsin.
[01:02:33.510 --> 01:02:34.010]  Ah, so what?
[01:02:34.210 --> 01:02:36.012]  But, I mean, I'm talking about, okay...
[01:02:36.949 --> 01:02:37.830]  No, it's your cat.
[01:02:38.190 --> 01:02:39.651]  No, I'll stop being sarcastic.
[01:02:39.671 --> 01:02:40.151]  Go ahead.
[01:02:40.571 --> 01:02:41.332]  You're right, Alex.
[01:02:41.392 --> 01:02:45.935]  But the point is that I'm not going to wait for Mr. Bush to save me.
[01:02:46.415 --> 01:02:53.719]  And what I'm saying here is, what I'm seeing at the local level is, my commissioner is saying to me, well, I have to support these mandates.
[01:02:53.959 --> 01:02:57.181]  And I'm trying very hard to let them know this legislation comes down.
[01:02:57.201 --> 01:02:59.002]  No, you need to fight these.
[01:02:59.022 --> 01:03:00.223]  No, that's balderdash.
[01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:05.566]  I mean, the feds can all claim we're their slaves tomorrow.
[01:03:05.586 --> 01:03:06.307]  It doesn't make it so.
[01:03:07.543 --> 01:03:15.487]  Well, what I'm saying, I guess, is that you're one that can bring this all to light, and John Hamill, I think, is really trying hard to expose this.
[01:03:16.168 --> 01:03:32.277]  And with Ron Paul trying to get us to withdraw from the WTO, which I understand after five years we get a chance to withdraw, I guess I'm sort of deleting the information from Bush because, you know, he's just in there as a puppet for, I guess, whatever you were talking about before.
[01:03:32.357 --> 01:03:34.258]  So if I leave the number with...
[01:03:35.342 --> 01:03:39.826]  You know, the caller, you know, the person that takes the calls, could you maybe consider getting one?
[01:03:40.948 --> 01:03:42.289]  My dear, I will do it.
[01:03:43.150 --> 01:03:49.336]  Give me the location info and I will get the guest on.
[01:03:49.956 --> 01:03:50.277]  Thank you.
[01:03:50.697 --> 01:03:51.318]  We shall return.
[01:03:52.986 --> 01:03:57.330]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.510 --> 01:04:01.934]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.074 --> 01:04:06.458]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.498 --> 01:04:07.860]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.641 --> 01:04:13.866]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:13.926 --> 01:04:20.856]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:20.976 --> 01:04:22.978]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.439 --> 01:04:27.921]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:53.183 --> 01:04:56.187]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:56.527 --> 01:05:05.357]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:05.677 --> 01:05:10.343]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:10.803 --> 01:05:17.548]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:17.929 --> 01:05:29.698]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:30.198 --> 01:05:34.642]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:34.822 --> 01:05:37.264]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:41.907 --> 01:05:42.968]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:52.919 --> 01:05:53.999]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[01:06:12.865 --> 01:06:16.746]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[01:06:16.966 --> 01:06:21.408]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[01:06:21.588 --> 01:06:25.429]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy-turn gear system.
[01:06:25.669 --> 01:06:31.851]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[01:06:32.051 --> 01:06:34.772]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[01:06:35.032 --> 01:06:35.673]  We just had a caller!
[01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:14.075]  Regina in Pennsylvania, for stations that carry the news and missed it, it was bringing up the free trade area of the Americas, or the FTAA.
[01:07:15.876 --> 01:07:27.303]  And just to boil down what global government is, you've got these big international corporations, and out of the 100 biggest economies, 45 of them are corporations.
[01:07:28.644 --> 01:07:32.306]  Of the 100 biggest governments or economies, 45 are corporations.
[01:07:32.995 --> 01:07:33.915]  They are government.
[01:07:33.975 --> 01:07:35.196]  They have private armies.
[01:07:35.336 --> 01:07:37.297]  They own most of our politicians.
[01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:42.459]  So this distinction of free market versus government, it's a fraud now.
[01:07:43.199 --> 01:07:46.681]  Oh sure, your little sub sandwich shop is free market.
[01:07:47.801 --> 01:07:50.643]  Your little car dealership of used cars is free market.
[01:07:51.983 --> 01:07:55.205]  Let's say you own a camping ground on your ranch, that's free market.
[01:07:55.905 --> 01:07:58.566]  But the big global corporations are not free markets.
[01:07:59.269 --> 01:07:59.950]  We're good to go.
[01:07:59.970 --> 01:08:00.370]  We're good to go.
[01:08:24.818 --> 01:08:28.239]  And we'll create this board, and we'll go to the U.N., and we'll go to the U.S.
[01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:29.119]  government and others.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.320]  They're all funded by the corporations that control us.
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:41.763]  And each country that we allow in can make their appointment, and then we'll sign deals, treaties, saying we'll follow what this private corporation says.
[01:08:44.063 --> 01:08:47.925]  And then you ask the average college student, what's the World Trade Organization?
[01:08:47.985 --> 01:08:49.325]  They have no earthly idea.
[01:08:49.910 --> 01:09:06.606]  ...conception what it is, even though under treaty and under these corporate agreements it now has more power than Congress, because Congress handed over, or abdicated, its control over to this group.
[01:09:08.658 --> 01:09:09.499]  And that's just one of them.
[01:09:09.979 --> 01:09:11.980]  And you go, well then Alex, you confuse me.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.341]  Is it the IMF?
[01:09:13.381 --> 01:09:14.202]  Is it the World Bank?
[01:09:14.242 --> 01:09:15.222]  Is it the WTO?
[01:09:15.262 --> 01:09:16.623]  Is it the World Health Organization?
[01:09:16.923 --> 01:09:17.804]  Is it the UN?
[01:09:18.104 --> 01:09:18.925]  Is it the Committee of 300?
[01:09:19.585 --> 01:09:20.546]  Is it the Bilderberg Group?
[01:09:20.586 --> 01:09:21.526]  Is it the CFR?
[01:09:21.726 --> 01:09:23.267]  Is it the Trilateral Commission?
[01:09:23.908 --> 01:09:27.350]  We're a world of 6 billion 300 and something million.
[01:09:28.611 --> 01:09:29.191]  That was in 2000.
[01:09:29.831 --> 01:09:31.773]  It's probably a lot more now.
[01:09:31.793 --> 01:09:34.674]  6 billion 500 and something million is what they're projecting.
[01:09:36.115 --> 01:09:36.996]  And so you've got
[01:09:37.788 --> 01:09:40.150]  Maybe ten different top global organizations.
[01:09:40.770 --> 01:09:43.672]  You're going, well, who's in power then, Mr. Jones?
[01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:44.712]  I've had the media ask me this.
[01:09:45.033 --> 01:09:46.914]  Who runs the conspiracy?
[01:09:47.194 --> 01:09:48.095]  It is a conspiracy.
[01:09:48.135 --> 01:09:49.956]  It's all in their own public operations.
[01:09:50.636 --> 01:09:55.579]  And it's about 200 people that are the chairman and the heads of these groups.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:04.305]  You may have 2,500 members in the CFR, but the chairman of it is on the Trilateral Commission, is in the Bilderberg Group, is...
[01:10:05.057 --> 01:10:14.624]  You know, on the board of the IMF and the World Bank and of the World Trade Organization, and his wife is the deputy director of the World Health Organization.
[01:10:15.185 --> 01:10:26.693]  It's about 200 people, and they all come from families that for hundreds of years have served what you know of as the robber barons from 100 years ago.
[01:10:27.594 --> 01:10:30.396]  Just a handful of families, no more than really 15 families.
[01:10:31.477 --> 01:10:32.938]  Globally, by the way.
[01:10:33.911 --> 01:10:34.311]  Oh, yes.
[01:10:34.592 --> 01:10:34.952]  Oh, yes.
[01:10:36.893 --> 01:10:43.519]  And so these are their different management teams in a corporate structure, which is a pyramidal command and control structure.
[01:10:43.559 --> 01:10:44.699]  What is pyramidal structure?
[01:10:45.020 --> 01:10:48.122]  A tiny elite that know all the information under them.
[01:10:49.063 --> 01:10:50.184]  That's the tip of the pyramid.
[01:10:50.224 --> 01:10:53.606]  And then right below that is the 200 what I call super gophers.
[01:10:55.608 --> 01:11:01.973]  And the super gophers are the Henry Kissingers, the James Bakers, the Paul Wolfowitzes of the world.
[01:11:03.783 --> 01:11:05.204]  And they just rotate in and out.
[01:11:05.224 --> 01:11:08.047]  You know, Deputy Defense Secretary, head of the World Bank.
[01:11:08.748 --> 01:11:12.912]  You know, Rumsfeld was Cheney's boss and the Bush's boss.
[01:11:14.093 --> 01:11:19.317]  I mean, Rumsfeld at a certain time early on was even vying to be over Bush Sr.
[01:11:19.638 --> 01:11:20.178]  Oh, yes.
[01:11:21.139 --> 01:11:22.761]  So they all just rotate around.
[01:11:22.801 --> 01:11:25.063]  They all work for the same 15 families.
[01:11:25.083 --> 01:11:27.165]  The commission does meet.
[01:11:30.059 --> 01:11:36.346]  At an even more high-level meeting than Bilderberg each year with a couple hundred members, no more than 175, with a few guests, around 200.
[01:11:36.546 --> 01:11:41.290]  And it's just like an old La Cosa Nostra mafia meeting.
[01:11:41.531 --> 01:11:46.716]  The 15 families get in with their gophers behind them, and they have their top experts come in and give them reports.
[01:11:46.776 --> 01:11:48.457]  And, well, our think tank study shows this.
[01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:52.161]  And they make the decisions, and they agree with each other, and it goes forwards.
[01:11:52.737 --> 01:12:00.644]  And they occasionally have mafia wars, and they'll kill each other, and they're always having to have food tasters and bodyguards.
[01:12:02.726 --> 01:12:03.646]  This is what they do.
[01:12:04.267 --> 01:12:07.049]  But they're so powerful that they own the dominant media.
[01:12:09.792 --> 01:12:10.172]  Look, look.
[01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:15.977]  The Trilateral Commission founded in 1973 by Brzezina Brzezinski
[01:12:18.923 --> 01:12:20.625]  Jimmy Carter and David Rockefeller.
[01:12:21.065 --> 01:12:23.487]  Those are the three members that founded the Trilateral Commission.
[01:12:24.068 --> 01:12:25.689]  And Rush Limbaugh says it doesn't exist.
[01:12:25.749 --> 01:12:26.830]  I mean, you can go to their website.
[01:12:27.611 --> 01:12:28.952]  Jimmy Carter's written books about it.
[01:12:28.972 --> 01:12:30.013]  David Rockefeller has.
[01:12:30.053 --> 01:12:31.154]  You know, Between Two Ages.
[01:12:32.155 --> 01:12:34.857]  Brzezina Brzezinski, National Security Advisor at the time.
[01:12:36.258 --> 01:12:40.382]  And they call us slaves and minions and they're going to take all our rights and world government.
[01:12:40.422 --> 01:12:41.223]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:12:41.443 --> 01:12:41.603]  I mean...
[01:12:43.024 --> 01:12:46.947]  Brzezinski's 97 book actually says that.
[01:12:47.428 --> 01:12:51.331]  Because they know 99.999 are not going to read it.
[01:12:52.972 --> 01:12:54.193]  They call us slaves.
[01:12:54.233 --> 01:12:55.394]  It's a big joke to them.
[01:12:58.136 --> 01:13:11.487]  And the Trilateral Commission was set up as a very select group of economists just to manage and juggle globalization and the merger of the European Union, the Asian Union, and the American Union.
[01:13:13.476 --> 01:13:31.247]  And then through those three unions, they subdivide through neo-imperialism or colonialism what they call the gap at the Pentagon, and that's all the third world islands and countries in Asia and in Africa and any, quote, rogue state, the Middle East.
[01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:35.730]  Those are to be divided up like China was before the Boxer Rebellion.
[01:13:37.892 --> 01:13:41.254]  See, I've got all this news and all these calls, but Regina brought up a really important point.
[01:13:42.102 --> 01:13:54.047]  And she said, Alex, you need to have these guests on to talk about Codex Alimentarius, which is a European EU law written up by the big drug companies that are predominantly based in Germany.
[01:13:54.067 --> 01:13:56.328]  Because they wrote the book on it.
[01:13:56.348 --> 01:13:58.808]  They're the most powerful in this game.
[01:14:00.249 --> 01:14:06.511]  And it doesn't have teeth yet to restrict vitamins and even vitamin C over the counter.
[01:14:07.032 --> 01:14:07.772]  It does in Europe.
[01:14:08.584 --> 01:14:11.945]  Until it is codified through treaty.
[01:14:13.086 --> 01:14:15.387]  And you see, we're already in the American Union.
[01:14:15.407 --> 01:14:18.028]  They're already paying Social Security to most of the Latin American countries.
[01:14:18.888 --> 01:14:20.549]  They're already merging our law enforcement.
[01:14:20.569 --> 01:14:24.670]  They got the bill for the National ID Card to have it as a Pan-American ID Card.
[01:14:24.710 --> 01:14:25.971]  I mean, that's in the legislation.
[01:14:26.011 --> 01:14:27.671]  I've had Ron Paul on this show to talk about it.
[01:14:27.972 --> 01:14:28.992]  I've read the subsection.
[01:14:30.698 --> 01:14:38.284]  And so, by the time they tell you it's an American Union, the clause is, when the American Union kicks in, it automatically links.
[01:14:38.764 --> 01:14:39.925]  This is in the Canadian papers.
[01:14:39.945 --> 01:14:40.906]  The Canadians know about it.
[01:14:40.926 --> 01:14:42.807]  They're freaking out, pulling their hair out.
[01:14:42.827 --> 01:14:46.330]  This has been in the Toronto Star CBC television.
[01:14:46.350 --> 01:14:47.311]  I covered it, what, a month ago?
[01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:51.114]  We've been telling you for nine years about it, but now here it has been codified.
[01:14:51.574 --> 01:14:56.458]  It automatically then merges, and treaties kick in to merge the laws with the EU.
[01:14:57.481 --> 01:15:06.367]  And then you simultaneously see the Supreme Court the last three years all over Time Magazine, USA Today, and on the news going, well, we do follow EU courts.
[01:15:06.707 --> 01:15:08.208]  Well, we do follow the UN courts.
[01:15:08.248 --> 01:15:11.150]  Well, they are actually the last court.
[01:15:11.570 --> 01:15:13.271]  We go off of their precedent now.
[01:15:13.891 --> 01:15:19.275]  And there's no juries, can't face your accuser, no free speech, no just compensation for property taken.
[01:15:19.535 --> 01:15:20.576]  We're now following that.
[01:15:20.616 --> 01:15:22.457]  They say, well, we're under that with treaty.
[01:15:24.022 --> 01:15:28.464]  And you know, if you watch any news or read any, you've heard how the Supreme Court's now saying this.
[01:15:28.764 --> 01:15:35.187]  So we're already in the American Union, and now it's kicking into the EU, and then see what happens under the trilateral model.
[01:15:35.207 --> 01:15:36.848]  And they wrote the book and said they'd do this.
[01:15:37.128 --> 01:15:38.028]  Do you understand?
[01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:46.152]  Under the trilateral model, you're not going to own your property.
[01:15:47.212 --> 01:15:52.715]  You're going to be the steward of it, and you'll have some use of it and get a small amount of the money from it if you're able to hold on to it.
[01:15:54.230 --> 01:15:58.532]  It's going to be modern mercantilism where certain sectors, certain countries do certain things.
[01:15:58.572 --> 01:16:03.414]  Just like, you ever seen the movie Rollerball made in the 70s with James Caan?
[01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:10.717]  You know, where you've got your energy city, you've got your communication city, you've got your... I mean, well, it's like that with countries.
[01:16:10.797 --> 01:16:11.558]  This is the model.
[01:16:12.198 --> 01:16:14.979]  And again, that film came out in the early 70s.
[01:16:15.119 --> 01:16:19.081]  It was based, and this has been admitted, off of the trilateral model.
[01:16:20.561 --> 01:16:21.902]  They always flaunt it.
[01:16:22.671 --> 01:16:37.767]  And see, mercantilism makes sure that no country is independent and free, only that the global empire over it is playing the different subsections and different divisions off against each other.
[01:16:40.189 --> 01:16:41.550]  So it's a monopoly game.
[01:16:41.631 --> 01:16:44.874]  And now they've basically, they're the bank.
[01:16:45.552 --> 01:16:47.253]  And the bank is now playing Monopoly.
[01:16:47.333 --> 01:16:49.174]  And the bank is able to buy up the whole board.
[01:16:49.675 --> 01:16:53.217]  And there's just a few little pieces of property still left in the middle class' hands.
[01:16:53.918 --> 01:17:02.343]  And they're greedily busy just getting rid of that now because they can't have any wealth that's independent because that will then threaten their monopoly of control, as they call it.
[01:17:03.544 --> 01:17:05.245]  The power monopoly of the state.
[01:17:06.006 --> 01:17:10.269]  Pun intended, using the analogy of Monopoly, the board game.
[01:17:11.349 --> 01:17:12.310]  By Milton Bradley.
[01:17:13.371 --> 01:17:13.591]  So...
[01:17:15.126 --> 01:17:28.615]  They say the UN UNIDIR, Small Arms Subgroup, said in 2000, July 7th, in New York, they said, civilian ownership of firearms threatens a legitimate power monopoly.
[01:17:28.695 --> 01:17:29.475]  I say it's illegitimate.
[01:17:29.996 --> 01:17:32.217]  The legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[01:17:32.257 --> 01:17:34.198]  I mean, they say, you cannot own guns.
[01:17:34.258 --> 01:17:35.379]  They're going to get your guns.
[01:17:35.659 --> 01:17:37.260]  We're going under international treaty.
[01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:44.385]  Germany has the FBI arrest citizens that write books denying the Holocaust.
[01:17:45.183 --> 01:17:46.584]  And shipping them back to Germany.
[01:17:46.924 --> 01:17:53.267]  Now, whether you believe that 10 billion Jews died, or 6 million died, or 5 million died, Hitler was bad.
[01:17:53.307 --> 01:17:54.328]  He did kill a lot of Jews.
[01:17:54.808 --> 01:17:56.029]  And 20 million other people.
[01:17:56.969 --> 01:18:00.691]  But regardless, the number's clearly under 6 million.
[01:18:01.511 --> 01:18:02.352]  I could be arrested now.
[01:18:02.432 --> 01:18:12.577]  Did you know that over in Germany, if you say 5,500,000 died, you are arrested and you spend like 2-3 years in prison.
[01:18:15.976 --> 01:18:20.397]  Well, now people who write books in this country denying it even happened, which is ridiculous.
[01:18:20.897 --> 01:18:26.558]  Hitler did go after Jews and kill, it looks like, upwards of 3 million.
[01:18:26.578 --> 01:18:27.458]  3 million, 6 million.
[01:18:27.718 --> 01:18:28.618]  What's the difference, folks?
[01:18:28.658 --> 01:18:29.678]  He did target the Jews.
[01:18:31.019 --> 01:18:33.099]  You write a book saying that that didn't happen.
[01:18:33.379 --> 01:18:35.059]  There have been cases where they arrest U.S.
[01:18:35.099 --> 01:18:36.700]  citizens and take them to Germany.
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:42.080]  And people say, well, that's the white supremacist.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.061]  He doesn't deserve rights.
[01:18:43.161 --> 01:18:45.301]  Yeah, but then they take your rights.
[01:18:46.869 --> 01:18:48.935]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:48.955 --> 01:18:49.336]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.988 --> 01:19:03.052]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:19:03.312 --> 01:19:14.536]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:19:14.876 --> 01:19:19.698]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:19:19.918 --> 01:19:20.378]  We're good to go.
[01:19:47.443 --> 01:19:47.903]  We're good to go.
[01:20:08.574 --> 01:20:21.864]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:27.688]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:20:27.989 --> 01:20:33.873]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:20:34.697 --> 01:20:37.998]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:04.375 --> 01:21:04.895]  We're good to go.
[01:21:04.935 --> 01:21:05.176]  I think?
[01:21:34.633 --> 01:21:36.735]  516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736 It's absolutely free.
[01:21:36.755 --> 01:21:39.217]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:21:39.237 --> 01:21:39.818]  Just call right now.
[01:21:53.084 --> 01:21:54.224]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:54.504 --> 01:21:59.486]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:21:59.766 --> 01:22:02.347]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:02.567 --> 01:22:11.089]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:22:11.469 --> 01:22:19.914]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[01:22:20.034 --> 01:22:23.496]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[01:22:23.736 --> 01:22:31.181]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.
[01:22:31.501 --> 01:22:33.462]  You've all heard about products that energize your water.
[01:22:33.522 --> 01:22:34.963]  Don't be fooled by imitators.
[01:22:35.003 --> 01:22:39.806]  Visit Aquanorthwest.com and learn more about the benefits of positively charged energy water.
[01:22:40.146 --> 01:22:40.746]  Call 888-7AQUA-NW.
[01:22:40.866 --> 01:22:41.246]  That's 888-727-8269.
[01:22:41.266 --> 01:22:42.407]  Or visit aquanorthwest.com.
[01:22:42.607 --> 01:22:44.668]  No, but this hate crime business...
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.080]  You protest, you get arrested.
[01:23:11.100 --> 01:23:14.081]  You say something bad about black people, you get arrested.
[01:23:14.101 --> 01:23:16.061]  You say something bad about white people, you get arrested.
[01:23:16.882 --> 01:23:22.103]  Whether you agree with what somebody's saying or doing or not, or booing the Pope, you get arrested.
[01:23:23.423 --> 01:23:27.384]  It should be people's right to do that, because if you take their right, you take everybody's right.
[01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:33.825]  And I think Hitler was very evil and corrupt and out of control and an occultist.
[01:23:34.045 --> 01:23:34.686]  I know he was.
[01:23:36.526 --> 01:23:36.706]  But...
[01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:41.669]  I will fight to the death for people's rights to say Hitler was a great guy.
[01:23:44.891 --> 01:23:46.372]  It's the same thing with Stalin.
[01:23:46.412 --> 01:23:47.793]  Some people say Stalin's great.
[01:23:48.894 --> 01:23:53.117]  I mean, did you know in England the farmers aren't even allowed to criticize French produce?
[01:23:53.477 --> 01:23:54.377]  People have been arrested.
[01:23:54.437 --> 01:23:55.538]  It's called xenophobic.
[01:23:55.878 --> 01:23:57.339]  Oh, you criticize their product.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:58.640]  That's hateful.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:04.064]  You said French products are garbage, was the billboard somebody put up.
[01:24:04.564 --> 01:24:05.605]  Well, you're going to be arrested.
[01:24:06.630 --> 01:24:12.272]  Remember I had the BBC Robin Page on, the host of One Man and His Dog.
[01:24:12.312 --> 01:24:15.032]  He walks around England on his rural affairs show.
[01:24:15.052 --> 01:24:16.893]  I think the show ran for like eight years or something.
[01:24:16.913 --> 01:24:22.074]  And he was giving a speech three years ago going, you know, you're taking our property and our rights.
[01:24:22.234 --> 01:24:27.175]  Rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[01:24:28.576 --> 01:24:29.316]  That's all he said.
[01:24:29.396 --> 01:24:32.957]  Well, in England, this is BBC headline, it was also in the London Telegraph,
[01:24:33.887 --> 01:24:40.171]  The word homosexual, if they decide you used it in a bad connotation as a slang, it's illegal to say that word.
[01:24:40.571 --> 01:24:45.374]  And Scotland Yard Diversity Unit came and arrested him.
[01:24:45.674 --> 01:24:46.554]  We had him on the broadcast.
[01:24:47.855 --> 01:24:52.498]  And then I have headlines where hundreds raided last night in hate crime sweep.
[01:24:52.958 --> 01:24:55.399]  People who've been reported for using racial slangs.
[01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:57.581]  They all face hard jail time.
[01:24:58.401 --> 01:25:00.202]  Raided a hundred homes last night.
[01:25:01.383 --> 01:25:01.663]  What?
[01:25:02.303 --> 01:25:02.584]  What?
[01:25:04.668 --> 01:25:06.971]  So, and you don't think it will come here?
[01:25:07.091 --> 01:25:09.275]  Remember the case earlier this year?
[01:25:11.498 --> 01:25:21.071]  Fourteen Christians out praying on the street corner in an unpermitted march, and the outfest was unpermitted as well.
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:22.600]  Permitted.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.701]  And they're there praying and people get around them yelling at them and all that.
[01:25:25.921 --> 01:25:28.182]  The police go, you're causing a disturbance because they're yelling at you.
[01:25:28.222 --> 01:25:28.622]  Stop it.
[01:25:28.662 --> 01:25:28.942]  Leave.
[01:25:29.243 --> 01:25:30.203]  So they go to another spot.
[01:25:30.283 --> 01:25:30.863]  Leave again.
[01:25:30.883 --> 01:25:31.984]  Okay, that's it.
[01:25:32.004 --> 01:25:34.164]  We're arresting you and charging you as terrorists.
[01:25:34.564 --> 01:25:36.145]  You face 45 years in prison.
[01:25:36.165 --> 01:25:37.506]  I actually said it, for terrorism.
[01:25:39.326 --> 01:25:44.188]  And the feds, Bush's Justice Department, advised them how to give them hard jail time.
[01:25:44.208 --> 01:25:46.649]  And finally another judge they appealed to dropped it.
[01:25:48.229 --> 01:25:50.090]  The point is they want to put you in prison.
[01:25:51.559 --> 01:25:52.640]  For protesting Bush.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:57.444]  They want to put you in prison for protesting at a parade.
[01:25:59.545 --> 01:26:01.007]  They want to put you in prison.
[01:26:02.388 --> 01:26:04.009]  It was the case, what, two years ago?
[01:26:04.029 --> 01:26:05.130]  And there's so many of these.
[01:26:05.190 --> 01:26:09.453]  Remember, it was in Boise, Idaho.
[01:26:10.734 --> 01:26:11.815]  It was a football game.
[01:26:12.115 --> 01:26:14.317]  And the woman was there from the local newspaper with a camera.
[01:26:14.878 --> 01:26:17.200]  And she took a photo of the coach who just lost the game.
[01:26:18.180 --> 01:26:19.581]  And this was in the newspaper.
[01:26:19.601 --> 01:26:20.162]  This was admitted.
[01:26:21.202 --> 01:26:25.686]  The black guy started strangling her, going, give me that camera, and cussing.
[01:26:26.647 --> 01:26:33.412]  Her white husband jumps out of the bleachers, runs down in front of the football game at the end of the game, and says, stop it.
[01:26:34.092 --> 01:26:46.682]  And the black guy says, get off me, you bleeper, a white slang, and he calls him the N-word back, and they arrested him for using the N-word, and then she was fired.
[01:26:46.982 --> 01:26:48.964]  We don't want people like you working here.
[01:26:51.198 --> 01:26:57.639]  I mean, I can't tell you how many times growing up in Dallas I had Hispanics and blacks call me different slangs for whites.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.060]  And why is that acceptable?
[01:27:01.700 --> 01:27:05.461]  But then it's not acceptable... I mean, I have to be honest with you.
[01:27:05.601 --> 01:27:13.343]  I never called people racial slangs back when they said them to me, but I sure thought about it in my head.
[01:27:13.363 --> 01:27:18.584]  And that's a dumb way to approach it, because it just feeds into the same paradigm.
[01:27:19.164 --> 01:27:19.324]  But...
[01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:22.260]  Why is the black guy allowed to do that?
[01:27:23.221 --> 01:27:26.263]  He should be allowed to say that, and the white guy should be allowed to say that back to him.
[01:27:26.843 --> 01:27:29.385]  The black guy should go to jail for attacking the woman.
[01:27:30.406 --> 01:27:32.287]  Because he was throwing a fit because his team had just lost.
[01:27:35.049 --> 01:27:36.570]  And this was in the newspaper.
[01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:39.592]  It was in the Associated Press, reporting it like it was normal.
[01:27:39.632 --> 01:27:40.053]  This happened.
[01:27:40.113 --> 01:27:41.454]  Oh good, she was fired, too.
[01:27:42.855 --> 01:27:43.695]  Fired from her job.
[01:27:43.956 --> 01:27:47.218]  And World Net Daily did a big report, and I had the guy on the show to tell the whole story.
[01:27:47.892 --> 01:27:50.114]  And he said, you know, I don't really dislike black people.
[01:27:50.174 --> 01:27:53.757]  I've got black friends, but he called me a name, so it seemed natural.
[01:27:55.138 --> 01:28:00.263]  And I forget they charged him with like a Class A misdemeanor.
[01:28:00.303 --> 01:28:01.824]  He was facing a lot of time in jail.
[01:28:02.204 --> 01:28:04.226]  I've got to call that guy back.
[01:28:05.067 --> 01:28:06.168]  Where are they now?
[01:28:06.228 --> 01:28:08.009]  That would be a good segment to do once a week.
[01:28:08.730 --> 01:28:11.612]  You know, go look up people I interviewed two, three years ago, four years ago.
[01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:15.636]  A lot of these cases, we cover what's happening, but never one ended up developing.
[01:28:18.186 --> 01:28:19.587]  I'll give you a where are they now.
[01:28:19.607 --> 01:28:29.816]  Remember the doctor from the Quad City Times who complained too much to the VA and the Homeland Security said, well, he didn't do anything illegal.
[01:28:30.817 --> 01:28:35.441]  He just complained too much, but we consider that terrorism, so we're arresting him.
[01:28:35.661 --> 01:28:36.442]  Where is he now?
[01:28:37.002 --> 01:28:39.985]  I'll tell you what happened to him when we get back and then we'll take your calls.
[01:28:43.556 --> 01:28:44.458]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.959 --> 01:28:46.562]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.484 --> 01:28:50.168]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:29:53.231 --> 01:29:53.831]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:53.931 --> 01:29:54.852]  Alex Jones here.
[01:29:54.972 --> 01:29:59.054]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.214 --> 01:30:02.095]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.175 --> 01:30:08.898]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.078 --> 01:30:12.079]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.279 --> 01:30:14.680]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:22.704]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements, such as
[01:30:22.984 --> 01:30:24.945]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:52.606 --> 01:30:59.231]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregosin, Oregano, Oregomax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[01:30:59.592 --> 01:31:09.740]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P7-3 oil, in particular the P7-3 Oregosin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[01:31:10.380 --> 01:31:11.862]  With a 100% kill.

[01:31:54.054 --> 01:31:59.178]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:59.838 --> 01:32:02.140]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:08.551 --> 01:32:13.873]  We have digressed severely off into other issues.
[01:32:16.214 --> 01:32:22.777]  But I do want to get into fans charged for booing during a moment of silence with the Pope.
[01:32:24.998 --> 01:32:32.461]  And again, if you're a Catholic and you're mad at them for doing this, still, they can do that at a football game, folks.
[01:32:34.262 --> 01:32:35.883]  Because next it'll be your free speech.
[01:32:37.423 --> 01:32:39.244]  Let's see how this slippery slope works.
[01:32:41.106 --> 01:32:43.347]  Also, Bill Clinton has found his new surrogate family.
[01:32:43.387 --> 01:32:43.968]  It's the Bushes.
[01:32:44.068 --> 01:32:45.549]  I didn't give this justice yesterday.
[01:32:46.289 --> 01:32:47.630]  I will spend time on it today.
[01:32:47.650 --> 01:32:49.071]  Just a bunch of other news.
[01:32:49.111 --> 01:32:49.932]  There's so much of it.
[01:32:50.633 --> 01:33:06.344]  Ariel Sharon, who helped give us false data about Iraq's WMD, has now presented Lord Bush with photographs he says prove that they have nuclear weapons production capabilities and we need to pressure them or invade them now.
[01:33:08.197 --> 01:33:15.201]  And so it really was a war council or confab that they had a few days ago.
[01:33:16.402 --> 01:33:21.005]  We'll be talking about that after we talk to Brock and Bill and Mike and David and Mark and others.
[01:33:22.526 --> 01:33:37.195]  But without further ado, before we do that, I haven't had her on in a few weeks and I was wondering why I had been contacted by Debbie New Millennium and I don't know if you want to mention this on air, Debbie, but I appreciate you coming on and I was sad to hear about your loss.
[01:33:38.027 --> 01:33:38.928]  Oh, I know.
[01:33:39.088 --> 01:33:39.669]  Thank you.
[01:33:39.789 --> 01:33:48.457]  And yeah, a lot of our customers already know that my daddy passed away on Friday, and so I've been off for a few days.
[01:33:48.537 --> 01:33:59.868]  So for people who are waiting to call in and they got the machine or whatever, you know, they can call me now, and I'm still trying to reach people that I missed while I was out for a few days.
[01:34:00.748 --> 01:34:04.311]  Well, I'm sorry to hear about your dad, and I'm sorry I didn't know about it until you mentioned it to me.
[01:34:04.351 --> 01:34:07.193]  But I was wondering, because you never called me last week to come on.
[01:34:07.213 --> 01:34:08.354]  I was like, where's Debbie?
[01:34:08.414 --> 01:34:10.556]  But sad to hear about your papa.
[01:34:10.596 --> 01:34:12.417]  Yeah, well, thank you very much.
[01:34:12.477 --> 01:34:19.483]  And I tell you, my dad went to the VA hospital for a while, and they were kind of helping him.
[01:34:19.523 --> 01:34:23.946]  But, you know, you've got to be really leery there, because we ended up taking him to another hospital.
[01:34:24.547 --> 01:34:27.189]  And by then it was a little bit too late, but it was kind of,
[01:34:27.987 --> 01:34:30.749]  Boy, could I tell you guys a story about the VA?
[01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:35.173]  One time when you have time, let me let you know what happened.
[01:34:35.213 --> 01:34:35.613]  Well, tell us.
[01:34:35.633 --> 01:34:36.253]  Tell us right now.
[01:34:36.614 --> 01:34:48.543]  Well, see, Daddy, actually, he's been going for years, and they were really good for years, but now he was 82, and he fell about a month, about five weeks ago.
[01:34:48.603 --> 01:34:56.529]  He fell, and he hurt his legs and his feet, you know, and he couldn't walk, and they swelled, so he went to his doctor at the VA.
[01:34:57.378 --> 01:35:02.948]  And the VA did, you know, scans to see and they couldn't find any broken bones or anything.
[01:35:04.724 --> 01:35:05.884]  They gave him morphine.
[01:35:06.264 --> 01:35:09.165]  And they sent him home with morphine to control the pain.
[01:35:09.705 --> 01:35:11.645]  But they said, well, we don't know what's wrong.
[01:35:11.705 --> 01:35:14.326]  And so for eight days, my dad was taking morphine.
[01:35:14.846 --> 01:35:17.206]  And I see this guy who drives.
[01:35:17.806 --> 01:35:19.667]  Even though he was 82, he still drove.
[01:35:19.727 --> 01:35:21.407]  He still had his own company, you know.
[01:35:21.827 --> 01:35:25.648]  And suddenly, he's like sitting in a chair hallucinating, you know.
[01:35:25.708 --> 01:35:28.268]  And he's telling me he can't bring his thoughts together.
[01:35:28.288 --> 01:35:31.989]  So I said, well, Daddy, you know, I don't know why they have you on morphine.
[01:35:32.029 --> 01:35:32.849]  I know, you know.
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:44.383]  So I went with him to the VA hospital three weeks ago, eight days after he was on the morphine, and I went and sat with his doctor, and... Debbie, let me just stop you.
[01:35:44.403 --> 01:35:49.985]  This sounds like what they do... To kill you off!
[01:35:50.565 --> 01:35:53.606]  They gave him the morphine to send him home to die.
[01:35:53.626 --> 01:35:57.747]  And if he would have been on morphine just a few more days...
[01:35:58.348 --> 01:36:01.469]  He would have just completely quit breathing at home.
[01:36:01.849 --> 01:36:10.891]  But after I went to the VA hospital that day, I took him to Baylor, and Baylor put him in intensive care immediately and stuff.
[01:36:10.911 --> 01:36:14.532]  But by then it was too late, and he struggled for a couple more weeks.
[01:36:14.752 --> 01:36:17.272]  What did it turn out was actually wrong with him?
[01:36:17.793 --> 01:36:27.635]  Well, you know, we never knew what made his feet swell or anything, but what happened was he became so weak from the morphine he couldn't swallow and he aspirated.
[01:36:28.075 --> 01:36:31.856]  And it filled his lungs up with liquid.
[01:36:32.217 --> 01:36:46.282]  To me, first of all, if my daddy was 82 and they said his kidneys were starting to slow down and he was slowing down, and I knew that, but they should tell you, look, we're sending you home with morphine, call hospice.
[01:36:46.702 --> 01:36:49.663]  We're going to give you a six-month diagnosis, you know,
[01:36:50.416 --> 01:36:51.757]  Make him comfortable.
[01:36:51.857 --> 01:36:53.638]  His kidneys are shutting down.
[01:36:53.698 --> 01:36:54.498]  Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:36:54.839 --> 01:36:56.039]  They didn't do any of that.
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:37:09.808]  And then when the morphine kicked in, he went from being a person who was still carrying sofas because he was an upholsterer for a living to somebody who couldn't even drive in eight days.
[01:37:09.828 --> 01:37:11.248]  Well, Debbie, let me comment on this.
[01:37:11.328 --> 01:37:16.251]  And I appreciate you talking about this so early after his death last Friday.
[01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:18.733]  I know this is hard for you, but let me just comment on this.
[01:37:19.648 --> 01:37:21.108]  This is exactly what they do.
[01:37:21.128 --> 01:37:23.169]  And I'm not saying all hospices, but a lot of them.
[01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:25.210]  And this is what we've heard about the VA.
[01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:28.551]  Now, here's your dad, who goes in there for treatment.
[01:37:28.571 --> 01:37:31.111]  He's still, as you said, able to carry sofas.
[01:37:32.332 --> 01:37:34.893]  He could have been given medication, probably, for his kidneys.
[01:37:35.273 --> 01:37:37.913]  Could have even gone on dialysis with another 5-10 years.
[01:37:38.614 --> 01:37:41.034]  All these things, but it's well known.
[01:37:41.094 --> 01:37:45.676]  You give somebody who's sick morphine over a long period of time, as you said, 8 days...
[01:37:47.475 --> 01:37:49.356]  It makes you start shutting down.
[01:37:49.716 --> 01:37:50.717]  You stop eating.
[01:37:51.918 --> 01:37:53.379]  But this is what they do with young men.
[01:37:53.439 --> 01:37:58.001]  Young men go in with DU sickness or other problems with real diagnosed problems.
[01:37:58.061 --> 01:38:01.383]  And sometimes they get saved before it's too late.
[01:38:01.664 --> 01:38:06.827]  They go to a real doctor and they find out that there's a problem.
[01:38:06.847 --> 01:38:07.727]  They're able to fix it.
[01:38:08.348 --> 01:38:11.870]  But this is... Listen, I talk to so many vets.
[01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:13.671]  And I'm not against Indians, folks, but...
[01:38:14.366 --> 01:38:22.629]  Why are, like, 70% is the number I've seen, of the doctors at the VA, these Indians, because they'll work for 20% of what an American doctor will.
[01:38:23.230 --> 01:38:24.350]  Everybody was foreign.
[01:38:24.410 --> 01:38:30.512]  And, you know, the doctor, when I went in to see him, Alex... Was he Indian?
[01:38:30.872 --> 01:38:31.113]  Yes.
[01:38:31.413 --> 01:38:39.256]  And he was pointing to the screen, and he's hitting the screen, and he's going, we've checked this, we've checked this, we've checked this, we've checked this.
[01:38:39.736 --> 01:38:40.376]  We don't know.
[01:38:40.556 --> 01:38:42.317]  He said, I'm telling you, I do not know
[01:38:42.882 --> 01:38:48.885]  Why your dad is in this much pain, so I'm sending him home with morphine, you know, to control the pain.
[01:38:48.945 --> 01:38:51.366]  He never once took me aside.
[01:38:51.386 --> 01:39:09.653]  And my dad, you know, because he was kind of out of it, and my dad was such a vital guy and he hated being like this, he said to the doctor, you know, he said, well, he said, you know, doctor, whatever, he said, I wish you'd just send me home with a pill that would just, you know, go ahead and just,
[01:39:10.054 --> 01:39:10.734]  Get it over with.
[01:39:10.814 --> 01:39:11.655]  It would just kill me.
[01:39:11.995 --> 01:39:13.175]  And you know what the doctor said?
[01:39:13.875 --> 01:39:15.456]  He said, you've got morphine.
[01:39:17.056 --> 01:39:18.317]  And he said it twice.
[01:39:18.997 --> 01:39:21.377]  Well, he can go to jail for that.
[01:39:21.438 --> 01:39:22.458]  I would call the police.
[01:39:22.958 --> 01:39:25.499]  You know, he actually said it twice.
[01:39:25.539 --> 01:39:26.319]  Yeah, I know.
[01:39:26.359 --> 01:39:27.579]  We're going to file a complaint.
[01:39:27.759 --> 01:39:32.401]  No, don't file a... Look, you don't go to Don Corleone to file a complaint on the mafia.
[01:39:32.801 --> 01:39:34.642]  You need... Don't go to the VA.
[01:39:35.222 --> 01:39:35.622]  Really?
[01:39:35.942 --> 01:39:37.542]  No, you need to go to the police department.
[01:39:38.363 --> 01:39:39.243]  Let me tell you something.
[01:39:39.938 --> 01:39:41.559]  Doctors, and there are laws on this.
[01:39:41.619 --> 01:39:42.240]  I can dig them up.
[01:39:42.660 --> 01:39:47.423]  He can get in a lot of trouble when your dad said that, going, well, you got morphine.
[01:39:47.843 --> 01:39:48.624]  He said it twice.
[01:39:49.865 --> 01:39:50.826]  And you're a witness to that?
[01:39:50.966 --> 01:39:51.166]  Yes.
[01:39:51.586 --> 01:39:52.307]  He said it twice.
[01:39:52.947 --> 01:39:54.308]  Well, he needs to go to jail.
[01:39:54.788 --> 01:39:55.028]  Really?
[01:39:55.689 --> 01:39:56.229]  Yeah, he does.
[01:39:56.249 --> 01:39:59.571]  Your dad, and I don't want to make you feel bad, because you did all you could do.
[01:39:59.591 --> 01:40:00.232]  They didn't tell you.
[01:40:01.693 --> 01:40:03.974]  They need to stop doing this, and they are doing this, Debbie.
[01:40:04.215 --> 01:40:04.495]  Uh-huh.
[01:40:05.074 --> 01:40:05.775]  Makes me sick.
[01:40:06.175 --> 01:40:14.520]  Yeah, well, now I'm a witness to it, because I had absolutely no idea that, you know... Did you see any doctors that were American?
[01:40:15.801 --> 01:40:16.101]  No.
[01:40:17.162 --> 01:40:18.223]  No, no, no.
[01:40:18.243 --> 01:40:19.324]  Well, I've seen the numbers.
[01:40:19.344 --> 01:40:20.284]  That was a couple years ago.
[01:40:20.364 --> 01:40:24.647]  It's like 70... I think it was 73% are from India alone.
[01:40:25.908 --> 01:40:33.273]  And it's a particular clan from India, because that's how they work over there, who are big on doctors, and they accept their medical degrees from India...
[01:40:34.014 --> 01:40:36.635]  And there have been cases of them cutting off the wrong legs.
[01:40:37.715 --> 01:40:41.396]  When somebody has a kneecap surgery and you just wake up, your legs cut off.
[01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:48.597]  Folks, I mean, I would not, I mean, and again, I know we have a lot of Indian listeners.
[01:40:48.637 --> 01:40:49.677]  I'm not bashing Indians.
[01:40:50.617 --> 01:40:55.418]  I just, these are people that can't get jobs in many cases anywhere else.
[01:40:56.179 --> 01:40:57.699]  And so they get a job at the VA.
[01:40:57.739 --> 01:40:58.859]  Was this the Temple VA?
[01:40:59.659 --> 01:41:01.440]  No, no, no, this is the one in Dallas.
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:02.840]  And you know, it was rated the worst.
[01:41:03.720 --> 01:41:05.441]  VA hospital in America.
[01:41:05.461 --> 01:41:08.143]  I don't want to say too much because you just lost your dad.
[01:41:08.183 --> 01:41:09.403]  I can really tell you about the VA.
[01:41:09.644 --> 01:41:10.004]  Yeah.
[01:41:10.044 --> 01:41:14.987]  Well, you know, in the past, they've done some good things for daddy, you know, over the years.
[01:41:15.007 --> 01:41:17.909]  No, I mean, the VA used to be, you know, not great, but okay.
[01:41:18.289 --> 01:41:21.811]  But, you know, I really learned a lot.
[01:41:21.851 --> 01:41:22.691]  I wish I didn't know.
[01:41:22.812 --> 01:41:29.976]  That's why I'm glad that you asked me to talk about it because had I known, I would have done things a lot differently, you know.
[01:41:31.318 --> 01:41:32.760]  Well, you just can't trust the government.
[01:41:32.780 --> 01:41:33.441]  You just don't know.
[01:41:33.481 --> 01:41:34.543]  You cannot trust any of them.
[01:41:35.003 --> 01:41:39.630]  Look, the VA is set up, and we could get Art Burncloud or others on here about it.
[01:41:40.131 --> 01:41:44.698]  The VA is set up where they get bonuses if they don't give treatment and don't spend money.
[01:41:45.817 --> 01:41:48.739]  And so a very small portion of the money actually goes to treatment.
[01:41:49.259 --> 01:41:53.481]  Do you want me to tell you what they do in other VA hospitals?
[01:41:53.501 --> 01:41:53.821]  Sure.
[01:41:54.401 --> 01:41:55.762]  Where there's not family involved?
[01:41:55.802 --> 01:41:56.142]  Mm-hmm.
[01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:56.663]  What?
[01:41:56.883 --> 01:42:05.107]  They chain the old men down, or the old women, predominantly old men, in rooms... I don't want to get into it.
[01:42:05.387 --> 01:42:05.707]  Yeah.
[01:42:06.388 --> 01:42:07.408]  I don't know if you want to hear this.
[01:42:07.628 --> 01:42:08.369]  No, that's okay.
[01:42:08.609 --> 01:42:09.149]  You don't want to know?
[01:42:09.209 --> 01:42:12.351]  I'm just glad right now that Daddy's not in pain anymore.
[01:42:12.591 --> 01:42:13.851]  Well, let me just put it to you this way.
[01:42:13.871 --> 01:42:15.652]  They put you in a room full of flies on purpose.
[01:42:16.633 --> 01:42:17.253]  Yeah.
[01:42:17.333 --> 01:42:18.474]  I need to warn people that are out there.
[01:42:18.514 --> 01:42:19.554]  I'll tell them later when you're done.
[01:42:19.574 --> 01:42:19.694]  Yeah.
[01:42:19.995 --> 01:42:21.115]  Well, you can tell them.
[01:42:21.135 --> 01:42:21.415]  Go ahead.
[01:42:21.695 --> 01:42:22.016]  Go ahead.
[01:42:22.056 --> 01:42:22.396]  I'm okay.
[01:42:22.436 --> 01:42:24.457]  They purposely put you in a room with flies.
[01:42:26.238 --> 01:42:27.098]  This is true.
[01:42:27.158 --> 01:42:29.259]  And the flies go up your nose and lay eggs in your brain.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:30.300]  Ew.
[01:42:31.954 --> 01:42:35.236]  And the joke with these doctors... Well, I'm not going to even say that.
[01:42:35.797 --> 01:42:39.819]  But anyways, Debbie, I'm very sorry about your father.
[01:42:40.480 --> 01:42:41.420]  Oh, thank you.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:42.341]  Thank you so much.
[01:42:42.601 --> 01:42:52.688]  Well, sweetheart, let's give folks the number to get the high-quality, made in America, not in India, or China, made in America water filters that cost the same.
[01:42:52.968 --> 01:42:56.750]  I shopped them years ago and bought a Berkey like five, six years ago before they were even sponsored.
[01:42:59.244 --> 01:43:06.347]  The Berkey I bought was, and at the time made in England, now made in America, was the same price as an Indian knockoff that did almost nothing.
[01:43:06.867 --> 01:43:08.268]  How do folks get a made in America filter?
[01:43:08.828 --> 01:43:10.469]  They can call me at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:43:10.489 --> 01:43:12.049]  That's 1-888-803-4438.
[01:43:12.129 --> 01:43:16.031]  Or they can go to the website, which is berkeywater.com, spelled B-E-R-K-E-Y-W-A-T-E-R.com.
[01:43:28.951 --> 01:43:35.981]  And also, there's been people since Wednesday last week that have left messages that I haven't been able to get back with.
[01:43:36.681 --> 01:43:40.166]  So either I get a recording or no answer.
[01:43:40.607 --> 01:43:45.033]  So if there's anybody out there who's waiting for me to call them back, please call me back, too.
[01:43:45.851 --> 01:43:51.015]  Because I am trying to get back with everybody, and I'm so sorry that it kind of slowed things down a little bit.
[01:43:51.235 --> 01:43:51.775]  Oh, come on.
[01:43:52.116 --> 01:43:56.359]  And again, New Millennium actually manufactures the black Berkey element.
[01:43:56.379 --> 01:43:58.921]  You also have the British Berkeys, if folks want that.
[01:43:59.701 --> 01:44:09.789]  And so, folks, you're getting it directly from the distributor, and Debbie handles the calls from this radio show and the other radio shows she does interviews on.
[01:44:09.909 --> 01:44:13.492]  You can get the Alex Jones special, save a lot of money, and get a free gift.
[01:44:13.952 --> 01:44:15.313]  Give her a call.
[01:44:15.713 --> 01:44:16.954]  She'll answer all your questions.
[01:44:16.974 --> 01:44:26.158]  888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com Tell them what free gift you want in the comments section.
[01:44:26.458 --> 01:44:29.440]  Debbie, thanks for being a good daughter.
[01:44:29.780 --> 01:44:31.821]  Your father has gone home to be with the Lord.
[01:44:32.021 --> 01:44:32.582]  That's right.
[01:44:32.682 --> 01:44:33.262]  Thank you.
[01:44:33.682 --> 01:44:35.783]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:44:35.903 --> 01:44:36.323]  Take care.
[01:44:37.064 --> 01:44:39.345]  I don't know if I should have gotten all off into the VA with her.
[01:44:39.445 --> 01:44:41.026]  Everybody out there listening needs to know this.
[01:44:41.946 --> 01:44:43.247]  It's called maggoting.
[01:44:44.250 --> 01:44:46.692]  And maggoting goes on all over the country.
[01:44:47.793 --> 01:44:55.118]  There were first two cases, and then a total of, what was it, four cases of maggoting just a couple years ago in Kansas City.
[01:44:56.019 --> 01:44:59.441]  And they claimed they stopped it, and then there was another maggoting case.
[01:45:00.522 --> 01:45:09.849]  And they chain them down, they tie them down, and the men beg for a week or so, like Terry Shivo, and then they pass out.
[01:45:10.470 --> 01:45:13.112]  And they've gone in and they're in pools of feces and urine.
[01:45:13.172 --> 01:45:14.613]  I'm sorry, but you've got to know what's going on.
[01:45:15.693 --> 01:45:19.656]  And normally, though, they don't die of dehydration because the flies get you first.
[01:45:21.177 --> 01:45:22.717]  And this is what flies do.
[01:45:25.339 --> 01:45:33.424]  They go into the sinus and they lay eggs and then the tissue necrosis and dies so that the maggots are able to eat it.
[01:45:34.130 --> 01:45:41.575]  Because maggots, unless they're screwworms, which were eradicated predominantly in the 60s, though they're back, they will actually eat fresh meat.
[01:45:42.415 --> 01:45:52.701]  But the screwworms then cause the sinus to die, and they eat that, and then they get into the brain and, well... I know I don't support the tribs.
[01:45:52.982 --> 01:45:59.866]  Supporting them means I put a plastic sticker on my car, made in China, that says I support the tribs, made by slaves.
[01:46:01.084 --> 01:46:03.746]  And then I don't care about the troops, and I just go, Bush is great.
[01:46:03.846 --> 01:46:08.009]  He stood in front of the Patriot football team yesterday.
[01:46:08.069 --> 01:46:10.031]  You're patriotic by not caring about the troops.
[01:46:10.191 --> 01:46:10.611]  I understand.
[01:46:10.651 --> 01:46:15.455]  But I will talk about the maggoting, and I won't shut up about it.
[01:46:15.935 --> 01:46:17.236]  Okay, fine.
[01:46:17.296 --> 01:46:19.858]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:46:19.878 --> 01:46:21.660]  Sorry, gone so long without calls here.
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:22.781]  Brock in British Columbia.
[01:46:22.801 --> 01:46:23.121]  Go ahead.
[01:46:23.781 --> 01:46:24.362]  Hi, Alex.
[01:46:24.782 --> 01:46:25.062]  Hello.
[01:46:25.343 --> 01:46:28.965]  I wanted to ask you one question and then follow up with another one.
[01:46:28.985 --> 01:46:29.726]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:30.513 --> 01:46:41.736]  I wondered if you could tie in the certain high-level masons and certain devil worshippers and the connection with eugenics.
[01:46:41.936 --> 01:46:44.357]  And then I had something to ask you after you answered that.
[01:46:45.657 --> 01:46:48.798]  Man, that's a treatise right there.
[01:46:49.198 --> 01:46:51.399]  That's a book, a volume, an encyclopedia.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:55.200]  People wonder where the Nazis came from.
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:46:57.481]  And my new film, Martial Law, answers that question.
[01:46:57.501 --> 01:46:58.481]  We spend a full hour on it.
[01:46:59.815 --> 01:47:17.799]  That, you know, Hitler was part of the same order of death that founded Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove, and they even communicated back and forth, these groups did, and they believe in survival of the fittest, they believe in killing and murder is beautiful and a good thing, they believe it's their right to do it, and the high-level Masons are members of this group as well.
[01:47:17.859 --> 01:47:28.422]  Most Masons aren't, so they don't, it's compartmentalized like everything else, and basically, the eugenics, Hitler got his eugenics from American eugenics,
[01:47:28.983 --> 01:47:30.984]  Oh boy.
[01:47:31.685 --> 01:47:54.440]  And I also got asked, I saw on the television yesterday, Bill Clinton sitting to the right of Kofi Annan, and I immediately thought, two men so crooked that when they die they'll have to screw them into the ground.
[01:47:55.100 --> 01:47:55.620]  Ha ha ha!
[01:47:55.640 --> 01:47:56.561]  Ha ha ha!
[01:47:57.236 --> 01:47:58.776]  You know, side by side.
[01:47:59.517 --> 01:48:09.219]  And I don't know whether they're trying to give the United Nations a boost by bringing a high-profile ex-president.
[01:48:09.239 --> 01:48:10.899]  The United Nations is a sham.
[01:48:11.380 --> 01:48:12.920]  It's an absolute disgrace.
[01:48:14.260 --> 01:48:19.021]  And it's an amoebic bunch of people that are just crooks.
[01:48:21.102 --> 01:48:21.962]  Yes, I agree with you.
[01:48:22.822 --> 01:48:24.503]  And do you think that they're trying to
[01:48:25.734 --> 01:48:28.077]  Give them a boost by bringing on Bill Clinton?
[01:48:28.958 --> 01:48:36.827]  I think, uh, Annen's going to leave in the next year, and I think there's a good chance, well, they've lined up seven of the G8 for Bill Clinton to be Secretary General.
[01:48:37.668 --> 01:48:43.074]  Well, Kofi Annen's probably going to take millions of dollars and, uh, uh,
[01:48:43.789 --> 01:48:46.970]  You know, probably go away laughing all the way to the bank.
[01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:48.491]  Well, it's like Kurt Voltheim.
[01:48:48.531 --> 01:48:53.913]  It comes out he's a top Nazi, hunting down Americans and others in Serbia and putting out the handbills.
[01:48:54.473 --> 01:48:56.754]  You know, rise up, the Jews are your enemy, kill them all.
[01:48:56.774 --> 01:48:59.255]  That was one of the posters he produced and distributed.
[01:48:59.875 --> 01:49:01.916]  And so they still give him his pension and defended him.
[01:49:02.476 --> 01:49:04.357]  And if you talk bad about him, you're anti-Semitic.
[01:49:04.437 --> 01:49:06.358]  If you're against Nazis, you're anti... I'm not joking.
[01:49:07.478 --> 01:49:08.819]  You've got to learn the double thing, sir.
[01:49:10.808 --> 01:49:11.548]  Boy, oh boy.
[01:49:11.708 --> 01:49:13.989]  Say you love Hitler, and you'll get an award from the ADL.
[01:49:14.029 --> 01:49:15.509]  Say you don't like Hitler, you'll be attacked.
[01:49:17.590 --> 01:49:23.052]  Well, I guess there's some devil worshippers that are high up that have set this whole paradigm.
[01:49:24.532 --> 01:49:25.813]  They are Luciferians.
[01:49:25.853 --> 01:49:27.233]  They think the devil is God.
[01:49:28.153 --> 01:49:31.794]  Yeah, and they're men that are too gutless to identify themselves.
[01:49:32.115 --> 01:49:33.115]  Do as thou wilt.
[01:49:33.215 --> 01:49:34.495]  That is the whole of the law.
[01:49:35.836 --> 01:49:39.937]  It's their motto, their maxim, their signet, their standard.
[01:49:41.135 --> 01:49:41.476]  There.
[01:49:42.198 --> 01:49:44.844]  They're gutless because they won't identify themselves.
[01:49:45.946 --> 01:49:46.488]  Absolutely.
[01:49:46.528 --> 01:49:48.332]  Transmission continues on the other side.
[01:49:48.873 --> 01:49:50.316]  Masses of news in your call.
[01:49:50.357 --> 01:49:50.798]  Stay with us.
[01:49:54.261 --> 01:50:01.649]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:06.655]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:06.895 --> 01:50:12.542]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:12.762 --> 01:50:13.483]  We're good to go.
[01:50:40.000 --> 01:50:40.440]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:53.268 --> 01:50:53.888]  We're good to go.
[01:51:14.975 --> 01:51:21.459]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.659 --> 01:51:26.741]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.861 --> 01:51:35.746]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[01:51:36.006 --> 01:51:40.869]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888
[01:51:46.272 --> 01:51:47.813]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:51:48.053 --> 01:51:50.835]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:52:09.506 --> 01:52:09.906]  I think so.
[01:52:25.014 --> 01:52:25.374]  We're good to go.
[01:53:01.465 --> 01:53:02.045]  Welcome back.
[01:53:02.245 --> 01:53:03.425]  The third hour is coming up.
[01:53:03.445 --> 01:53:07.226]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to go to Bill, Michael, Daryl, Mark, and John.
[01:53:07.266 --> 01:53:12.927]  Then I'm just going to cover news for the rest of the broadcast.
[01:53:13.848 --> 01:53:22.110]  And I'm going to be sitting in today with Jack Blood for the full two hours of his program that comes right after this transmission.
[01:53:28.846 --> 01:53:30.847]  And so that's coming up as well.
[01:53:32.469 --> 01:53:36.371]  Before I go back to your calls, just very briefly, my new film, Martial Law, is out.
[01:53:37.032 --> 01:53:46.258]  My best film, covers 9-11, who controls the globalists, the secret society behind the secret societies, the latest police state developments.
[01:53:46.298 --> 01:53:47.238]  It's my best film.
[01:53:47.279 --> 01:53:48.679]  You've heard the reviews from listeners.
[01:53:49.320 --> 01:53:51.742]  Over three hours on DVD, two hours, 35 minutes on VHS, $25.95.
[01:53:56.132 --> 01:53:58.574]  And then if you get multiple copies, it goes down as low as $14.
[01:53:59.034 --> 01:54:01.697]  Got a bunch of other specials I'm running.
[01:54:02.177 --> 01:54:03.919]  Three new t-shirts we're offering.

[01:54:32.988 --> 01:54:36.269]  Please call 888-253-3139.
[01:54:37.609 --> 01:54:38.590]  Please get the new film.

[01:54:43.571 --> 01:54:46.092]  Let us now go back to the calls.
[01:54:46.832 --> 01:54:48.592]  Bill in Texas, go ahead.
[01:54:50.833 --> 01:54:51.373]  Hello, Bill.
[01:54:54.329 --> 01:54:55.029]  Hello, William.
[01:54:56.210 --> 01:54:56.930]  Wake up, William.
[01:54:58.911 --> 01:54:59.311]  All right.
[01:55:00.191 --> 01:55:00.731]  He's gone.
[01:55:00.751 --> 01:55:04.372]  Let's talk to Michael in New York.
[01:55:04.412 --> 01:55:05.013]  Go ahead, Michael.
[01:55:06.453 --> 01:55:06.573]  Hi.
[01:55:06.613 --> 01:55:07.594]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:55:07.714 --> 01:55:08.754]  Hello, Michael.
[01:55:08.894 --> 01:55:09.414]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:09.474 --> 01:55:10.575]  Another pleasure.
[01:55:10.815 --> 01:55:12.855]  Again, looking forward to getting the DVD.
[01:55:12.895 --> 01:55:14.816]  I should have it any day, and I'm excited.
[01:55:14.876 --> 01:55:17.377]  Can't wait to see it and make copies and get it to my friend.
[01:55:17.799 --> 01:55:18.179]  Good.
[01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:27.008]  Now I want to just, Alex, great show, covering so much, there's so much to cover, but I'm going to get into the technology that you started off with earlier.
[01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:35.918]  Essentially, you know, the devils, they're all devil worshippers, that's all true, we all know that, and they got us into their devil system.
[01:55:36.378 --> 01:55:38.460]  And that includes the technology end.
[01:55:39.201 --> 01:55:40.963]  Everything from the devil is dark,
[01:55:42.301 --> 01:55:44.042]  And expensive and it pollutes.
[01:55:44.122 --> 01:55:46.984]  It contaminates everything it comes in contact with.
[01:55:47.324 --> 01:55:48.244]  That's petroleum.
[01:55:48.945 --> 01:55:50.225]  Now, also the chip.
[01:55:50.825 --> 01:55:53.327]  I used to make chips for IBM for years.
[01:55:53.847 --> 01:55:56.948]  Very advanced chips for mainly military purposes.
[01:55:57.429 --> 01:56:01.951]  And so the chip itself is all black magic science.
[01:56:02.351 --> 01:56:03.592]  I am a scientist.
[01:56:03.752 --> 01:56:05.533]  I was hired as a chemist for IBM.
[01:56:06.053 --> 01:56:10.335]  And then I got involved with every facet of the semiconductor engineering.
[01:56:11.184 --> 01:56:12.966]  I know everything about it inside out.
[01:56:13.807 --> 01:56:15.389]  And it's all black magic.
[01:56:15.429 --> 01:56:20.854]  Now, a lot of people I knew working in the manufacturing line, they're all dead.
[01:56:21.555 --> 01:56:22.656]  In their 30s, in their 40s.
[01:56:24.247 --> 01:56:24.887]  Mainly all dead.
[01:56:24.907 --> 01:56:27.570]  There was a big lawsuit against IBM.
[01:56:27.590 --> 01:56:28.771]  Well, this is off the charts.
[01:56:28.791 --> 01:56:29.752]  I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:56:30.493 --> 01:56:31.794]  I mean, they map these chips.
[01:56:32.054 --> 01:56:33.215]  We know how these chips work.
[01:56:33.235 --> 01:56:34.797]  You're saying it's black magic.
[01:56:34.837 --> 01:56:35.377]  What does that mean?
[01:56:35.698 --> 01:56:37.620]  What I'm referring to is when you make a chip.
[01:56:38.440 --> 01:56:41.864]  I'm not talking about the application of the chip when it's used in electronics.
[01:56:42.264 --> 01:56:45.087]  I'm referring to the manufacturing of a semiconductor.
[01:56:45.607 --> 01:56:50.809]  A chip itself made in a manufacturing... You're going to have to get to the point real fast.
[01:56:50.829 --> 01:56:52.310]  Okay, so it's all black magic.
[01:56:52.410 --> 01:56:54.571]  Everything used to make them is poison.
[01:56:55.171 --> 01:56:55.751]  All poisons.
[01:56:55.851 --> 01:56:58.412]  Oh, that's your analogy or your... Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:58.612 --> 01:56:59.253]  But it's real.
[01:56:59.333 --> 01:57:00.073]  It's real science.
[01:57:00.193 --> 01:57:03.134]  It's all poisons, the gases, the liquids, everything.
[01:57:03.234 --> 01:57:04.475]  All the chemistry is poison.
[01:57:04.515 --> 01:57:09.897]  Everybody comes in contact with it dies of cancer and all kinds of other forms of cancer.
[01:57:10.495 --> 01:57:12.216]  Well, I mean, look at the cell phones.
[01:57:12.256 --> 01:57:13.777]  Everybody knows it microwaves your head.
[01:57:13.817 --> 01:57:14.857]  We still all use it.
[01:57:15.298 --> 01:57:16.959]  Everything they do is poisonous and evil.
[01:57:16.979 --> 01:57:17.339]  That's right.
[01:57:17.359 --> 01:57:24.903]  So, Alex, we've got to keep on the technology end and get that technology, the light technology, to give us freedom and no pollution.
[01:57:27.204 --> 01:57:29.846]  Well, there are technologies that aren't as polluting.
[01:57:30.246 --> 01:57:31.407]  Listen, thanks for the call, sir.
[01:57:31.447 --> 01:57:33.728]  I really appreciate it.
[01:57:35.049 --> 01:57:38.771]  We'll come back and take more calls and then get into all this news.
[01:57:38.791 --> 01:57:39.151]  Stay well, sir.
[01:57:49.714 --> 01:57:50.375]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.015 --> 01:57:52.076]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.797 --> 01:57:53.918]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.538 --> 01:57:55.379]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:57.040]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.701 --> 01:58:01.344]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.885 --> 01:58:05.968]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.705 --> 01:58:17.769]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight, now into hour number 3 on this Thursday edition.
[01:58:19.089 --> 01:58:22.231]  We're going to continue with your phone calls here for a little while.
[01:58:24.012 --> 01:58:25.613]  David and Mark and John and others.
[01:58:25.673 --> 01:58:28.735]  Then I want to get into something I mentioned yesterday, but didn't spend enough time on.
[01:58:29.275 --> 01:58:31.396]  Bill Clinton finds his surrogate family.
[01:58:31.936 --> 01:58:34.638]  George Herbert Walker Bush is now his surrogate father.
[01:58:36.403 --> 01:58:37.384]  That's the Boston Globe.
[01:58:37.404 --> 01:58:39.785]  I've got a bunch of hate crime news that I want to go over.
[01:58:40.245 --> 01:58:42.847]  There's a bunch of them, but let's just go right back to your calls right now.
[01:58:44.708 --> 01:58:46.429]  Let us talk to David in Illinois.
[01:58:46.469 --> 01:58:47.229]  David, go ahead.
[01:58:47.850 --> 01:58:50.471]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:58:50.571 --> 01:58:54.454]  This new NASA head that Bush nominated, Dr. Michael Griffin.
[01:58:54.674 --> 01:58:59.737]  Yeah, formerly with the CIA and did a bunch of other secret government programs.
[01:59:00.637 --> 01:59:04.840]  Yeah, he worked for a computer science corporation who owns DynCorp.
[01:59:05.580 --> 01:59:10.163]  He was a SDI developer for Star Wars.
[01:59:11.224 --> 01:59:15.287]  He was the president of In-Q-Tel, which is directly funded by the CIA.
[01:59:16.308 --> 01:59:26.435]  Yesterday, the Russian defense minister came out and said that he's opposed to the United States militarizing space.
[01:59:26.595 --> 01:59:32.860]  Well, that's because the whole space program is a front for nuclear-based space-based weapons, particle beams...
[01:59:34.264 --> 01:59:39.387]  Black man of space planes, Aurora, and that's all they're doing.
[01:59:40.187 --> 01:59:46.030]  And once again, you know, all the Democrats who, you know, you'd think they'd be pretending to not like Star Wars.
[01:59:46.050 --> 01:59:48.971]  They're all saying how much they love the guy.
[01:59:48.991 --> 01:59:56.475]  You know what's over NORTHCOM and the entire Pentagon and what is the highest level echelon at the Joint Chiefs?
[01:59:57.075 --> 01:59:59.476]  It's Space Command, based in Colorado.
[02:00:00.498 --> 02:00:02.459]  And they got the Space Command patch, everything.
[02:00:02.499 --> 02:00:04.559]  That's what runs the whole ball of wax.
[02:00:05.619 --> 02:00:12.401]  A little off this subject, but I was flipping through the channels last night and I saw they caught the front end of the Revelations thing.
[02:00:13.762 --> 02:00:14.842]  Yeah, the TV show.
[02:00:15.122 --> 02:00:18.083]  Yeah, it was basically like the beginning was like Faces of Death.
[02:00:18.143 --> 02:00:19.903]  They showed a guy falling from a building.
[02:00:19.923 --> 02:00:21.464]  I'm not sure if it was 9-11 or not.
[02:00:21.964 --> 02:00:29.166]  They showed the video of that thing from Iraq where they showed the night vision guys, the insurgents, being shot by a cannon.
[02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:30.591]  I couldn't believe it.
[02:00:30.871 --> 02:00:35.897]  They're showing basically faces of death material on NBC at 8 o'clock.
[02:00:35.917 --> 02:00:40.642]  Gotta condition us so when our neighbors are being arrested and tortured, it'll be good.
[02:00:40.662 --> 02:00:41.523]  It's good.
[02:00:42.044 --> 02:00:42.324]  Yeah.
[02:00:43.065 --> 02:00:43.846]  Well, thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:00:44.126 --> 02:00:44.487]  Thank you.
[02:00:45.293 --> 02:00:47.014]  I mean, look at the most unwholesome shows.
[02:00:47.054 --> 02:00:58.580]  They have shows on Fox where you go to an island and luscious prostitutes try to make your husband cheat on you, and then ABC or whatever has the Desperate Housewives, and all the cop shows are about torture.
[02:00:58.620 --> 02:01:02.202]  It's just they're scientifically warping people.
[02:01:02.242 --> 02:01:03.222]  We have the documents.
[02:01:03.783 --> 02:01:05.003]  Good points, David.
[02:01:05.744 --> 02:01:06.644]  Mark in Texas.
[02:01:06.724 --> 02:01:07.485]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:01:07.945 --> 02:01:09.145]  Alex, good afternoon.
[02:01:09.466 --> 02:01:10.066]  Hello, sir.
[02:01:10.386 --> 02:01:13.808]  I was listening to some of the Queer Channel conservatism.
[02:01:14.614 --> 02:01:19.256]  It was going on the last few days, and they're back with the full court press on the flat tax.
[02:01:20.257 --> 02:01:32.263]  You know, Sunday, I've been thinking that the government, if we enter in a hyperinflation type situation like Argentina, etc., etc., etc., the government can't come away losing on this deal.
[02:01:32.323 --> 02:01:40.688]  So if they can get a flat tax in and get us out of this tax bracket taxation that we're in right now, which would totally cut their take...
[02:01:42.048 --> 02:01:43.730]  They get us into a flat tax.
[02:01:43.870 --> 02:01:45.632]  It's inflation-proof, old buddy.
[02:01:48.355 --> 02:01:54.201]  Well, the globalists are all over radio saying we've got to have a national sales tax.
[02:01:54.221 --> 02:01:55.622]  We've got to have a national sales tax.
[02:01:56.363 --> 02:01:58.125]  So if bread goes from $2 to...
[02:02:00.428 --> 02:02:04.270]  $20, their amount of power that they suck out of us, no matter how much they devalue the dollar.
[02:02:04.290 --> 02:02:04.610]  No, you're right.
[02:02:04.630 --> 02:02:10.673]  If you've got really bad inflation, that means you'll be able to cheat the tax man because it'll be indexed off of last year's numbers.
[02:02:11.154 --> 02:02:13.455]  Or the flat tax, or the sales tax.
[02:02:13.895 --> 02:02:19.357]  Even if the price quadruples, their percentage of their take will remain the same.
[02:02:19.398 --> 02:02:20.278]  It's inflation-proof.
[02:02:21.269 --> 02:02:22.731]  The flat tax will be in place.
[02:02:22.751 --> 02:02:23.251]  Good point.
[02:02:23.291 --> 02:02:24.212]  Well, they're pushing flat tax.
[02:02:24.232 --> 02:02:25.994]  They're also pushing sales tax.
[02:02:26.014 --> 02:02:27.335]  Do you want to talk some more about it?
[02:02:27.815 --> 02:02:28.596]  Oh, the sales tax.
[02:02:28.616 --> 02:02:29.597]  I don't want to get into that.
[02:02:29.617 --> 02:02:30.818]  I think that's the worst thing ever.
[02:02:30.858 --> 02:02:32.580]  But conservatism is killing us.
[02:02:33.241 --> 02:02:33.781]  Anything else?
[02:02:33.961 --> 02:02:34.782]  That'll do it, buddy.
[02:02:34.822 --> 02:02:35.623]  Thanks for your time.
[02:02:35.843 --> 02:02:36.684]  Thank you for calling.
[02:02:37.345 --> 02:02:39.667]  We'll be back with a few more calls and the plunge into the news.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:49.583]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.764 --> 02:02:54.187]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.327 --> 02:02:58.711]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.751 --> 02:03:00.092]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.893 --> 02:03:06.115]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.175 --> 02:03:13.099]  We rip the Senator Patron Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.219 --> 02:03:15.221]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.001 --> 02:03:16.621]  We're good to go.
[02:03:16.641 --> 02:03:17.842]  We're good to go.
[02:03:44.660 --> 02:03:48.142]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:48.402 --> 02:03:51.905]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.005 --> 02:03:55.947]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:56.167 --> 02:04:02.331]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:02.731 --> 02:04:10.656]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.056 --> 02:04:16.398]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:16.558 --> 02:04:20.319]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.679 --> 02:04:22.539]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:04:22.599 --> 02:04:24.780]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:29.942]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:04:30.002 --> 02:04:35.543]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:05:13.785 --> 02:05:14.845]  gold and silver coins.
[02:05:14.946 --> 02:05:16.046]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[02:05:16.206 --> 02:05:16.966]  Which are collectible?
[02:05:17.026 --> 02:05:17.766]  Which are bullion?

[02:05:49.685 --> 02:05:50.345]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.006 --> 02:05:52.066]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.766 --> 02:05:53.866]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.507 --> 02:05:55.387]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.107 --> 02:05:56.987]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.007 --> 02:06:01.308]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.828 --> 02:06:05.989]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.050 --> 02:06:11.491]  A caller just called in about a flat tax.
[02:06:14.071 --> 02:06:17.152]  And a flat tax having a set income tax rate.
[02:06:18.599 --> 02:06:25.901]  I quite frankly think he is better than his graduated income tax, but the globalists are never going to do that.
[02:06:25.941 --> 02:06:27.581]  They dangle that out in front of you.
[02:06:29.422 --> 02:06:32.782]  And the only problem with it is, I think it should cut off.
[02:06:33.623 --> 02:06:37.924]  I mean, I think if you're making $20,000 a year and you're single, you shouldn't be paying the federal income tax.
[02:06:37.944 --> 02:06:39.244]  You shouldn't be paying it, period.
[02:06:39.284 --> 02:06:40.424]  It's totally unconstitutional.
[02:06:40.684 --> 02:06:44.305]  They've got tariffs and trade and other forms of taxes that are constitutional.
[02:06:45.725 --> 02:06:47.906]  But I mean, talking about within their controlled system.
[02:06:48.920 --> 02:06:53.241]  If you've got children, you shouldn't be paying taxes if you're making less than $30,000 a year.
[02:06:54.281 --> 02:07:00.863]  But again, they want you dependent where you've got to take welfare, got to take government assistance, or got to put your children in public schools.
[02:07:03.143 --> 02:07:04.344]  Got to be in their system.
[02:07:04.384 --> 02:07:05.304]  That's what it's all about.
[02:07:06.864 --> 02:07:15.046]  But the sales tax is really bad because that brings federal control into every terminal, every cash register.
[02:07:15.887 --> 02:07:17.507]  It brings federal regulation in.
[02:07:18.980 --> 02:07:22.542]  And also, you're going to have to swipe your standardized driver's license.
[02:07:22.602 --> 02:07:23.823]  It's really a national ID card.
[02:07:23.863 --> 02:07:24.563]  That's not a law.
[02:07:25.363 --> 02:07:33.808]  They'll swipe it because if you do make under a certain amount, you will not be paying a sales tax if you're in, quote, poverty, which they say is like $10,000 a year.
[02:07:35.669 --> 02:07:46.355]  So you'll have to swipe your card, and they'll have to have tax police to check, oh, we've got poor people going in who are swiping their card and buying stuff and then selling it to others, you know, because there's a 15% discount.
[02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:50.248]  And then they'll have to track their saying.
[02:07:50.288 --> 02:07:50.789]  They're saying.
[02:07:51.689 --> 02:07:52.950]  Those that are pushing this.
[02:07:52.970 --> 02:07:56.893]  Then they'll have to track how much you're buying, what you're doing.
[02:07:58.454 --> 02:08:06.440]  Oh, this algorithm in your file shows you're buying too much food and too much toilet paper and too many cars and products for how much money you make.
[02:08:06.500 --> 02:08:07.161]  It's impossible.
[02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:11.504]  You're either a drug dealer, so we've got to raid you, or you're buying goods for other people.
[02:08:14.184 --> 02:08:17.365]  You know, the cops are already busting your house if you, quote, use too much power.
[02:08:17.405 --> 02:08:18.725]  Ooh, you must have grow lights.
[02:08:19.965 --> 02:08:22.206]  And it's an old lady who's got ten fish tanks.
[02:08:24.766 --> 02:08:25.526]  They already do this.
[02:08:26.006 --> 02:08:27.887]  It's just going to be worse and worse and worse.
[02:08:27.927 --> 02:08:31.407]  And then it also tracks and traces everything you buy and purchase and what you do.
[02:08:31.447 --> 02:08:32.288]  So total surveillance.
[02:08:35.108 --> 02:08:36.328]  And they're already doing it.
[02:08:37.969 --> 02:08:40.209]  You know, I tried to buy gas at Chevron the other day.
[02:08:40.229 --> 02:08:43.950]  And I normally pay for most stuff with cash, but I pulled out my credit card, stuck it in the slot.
[02:08:44.730 --> 02:08:48.412]  And it said, give us your zip code.
[02:08:50.413 --> 02:08:51.834]  And it wasn't to check for fraud.
[02:08:51.914 --> 02:08:53.414]  It was so they know where to build stores.
[02:08:53.454 --> 02:08:54.655]  And I'm not going to do work for them.
[02:08:54.675 --> 02:08:55.335]  I'm not going to start.
[02:08:55.615 --> 02:08:57.096]  This food will be three or four questions.
[02:08:57.877 --> 02:09:00.578]  So instead of getting $40 in gas, I got $10 in gas.
[02:09:00.618 --> 02:09:02.179]  I went in and paid them cash, and I told them.
[02:09:03.119 --> 02:09:04.120]  Don't put up with that.
[02:09:05.080 --> 02:09:06.841]  It's all just little things like that.
[02:09:09.222 --> 02:09:12.684]  I'll tell you what Randall's Food Stores do if you use a credit card.
[02:09:13.626 --> 02:09:18.349]  First, they'll push you to take a discount customer loyalty card, which they found.
[02:09:18.889 --> 02:09:20.190]  They actually look at those numbers.
[02:09:20.770 --> 02:09:26.653]  Other big chains, I haven't seen it specifically with Randall's, but it's obvious, sell that data to the government and others.
[02:09:27.794 --> 02:09:29.515]  What you buy, what you do builds a database.
[02:09:29.975 --> 02:09:35.498]  But also they look at what people have to buy, what they have to have, what they can get away charging people more for.
[02:09:36.078 --> 02:09:38.540]  So actually over time it ends up costing you money.
[02:09:38.600 --> 02:09:39.220]  It's a big scam.
[02:09:40.194 --> 02:09:43.275]  You might pay 20% more at the register because you don't have that card.
[02:09:43.815 --> 02:09:48.356]  Well, then if you use a credit card, and I normally use cash, sometimes I don't have enough cash, I use a credit card.
[02:09:48.416 --> 02:09:49.457]  I buy too much.
[02:09:50.417 --> 02:09:55.538]  And when you swipe it through the reader, it goes ahead and goes through it like it's a Randall's card.
[02:09:55.558 --> 02:09:58.539]  It goes ahead and reads that and scans it and still makes a record.
[02:09:58.739 --> 02:10:01.000]  Then you've got to do it again for the transaction.
[02:10:01.760 --> 02:10:02.701]  And I said, what's it doing?
[02:10:02.721 --> 02:10:04.061]  Oh, it treats it as a Randall's card.
[02:10:04.081 --> 02:10:05.081]  It's still getting your info.
[02:10:05.601 --> 02:10:07.342]  Oh, how nice!
[02:10:08.993 --> 02:10:10.334]  You know, frankly, that's stealing.
[02:10:10.995 --> 02:10:12.917]  You know what I hate?
[02:10:12.937 --> 02:10:14.258]  You go buy something somewhere.
[02:10:15.139 --> 02:10:19.282]  No matter what it is, this is just the annoyance of Big Brother.
[02:10:19.402 --> 02:10:20.844]  There's a hundred other things that are worse.
[02:10:21.564 --> 02:10:23.726]  The control, the manipulation, the taxation.
[02:10:24.227 --> 02:10:25.548]  But you go buy something somewhere.
[02:10:26.369 --> 02:10:27.249]  You use a credit card.
[02:10:28.691 --> 02:10:32.754]  And suddenly you get junk mail specifically for what you purchased.
[02:10:33.315 --> 02:10:33.996]  Accessories.
[02:10:34.256 --> 02:10:35.477]  They're selling your name.
[02:10:37.566 --> 02:10:49.811]  That's why at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, when you order one of my books, one of my t-shirts, one of my videos, nothing is sold to anyone.
[02:10:49.851 --> 02:10:51.692]  And believe me, I've been offered a lot of money to do it.
[02:10:52.712 --> 02:10:53.072]  Nothing.
[02:10:53.172 --> 02:10:54.653]  No names, no nothing.
[02:10:55.773 --> 02:10:59.055]  Even other, you know, patriot groups have offered to, you know, buy my mailing list.
[02:10:59.875 --> 02:11:01.015]  And, no.
[02:11:02.176 --> 02:11:04.157]  You can offer me $20,000 if you want.
[02:11:04.277 --> 02:11:06.778]  I am not selling those names.
[02:11:06.938 --> 02:11:07.138]  Ever.
[02:11:08.388 --> 02:11:08.608]  Ever.
[02:11:11.331 --> 02:11:12.932]  So, that's the bottom line.
[02:11:14.654 --> 02:11:17.136]  We have our rules and what we do.
[02:11:18.678 --> 02:11:24.423]  Because the problem is that Patriot group will then sell it again to somebody else who sells it again to somebody else who sells it again.
[02:11:24.443 --> 02:11:27.426]  You know, I gave money to the Republicans ten years ago.
[02:11:28.507 --> 02:11:29.608]  To Pat Buchanan and others.
[02:11:30.129 --> 02:11:32.591]  And I still, during elections, get jam-packed
[02:11:33.283 --> 02:11:36.144]  My mailbox, full of, please give money.
[02:11:36.264 --> 02:11:37.484]  Oh, Hillary's evil.
[02:11:37.524 --> 02:11:38.244]  She's going to get us.
[02:11:38.264 --> 02:11:38.844]  Give us money.
[02:11:38.884 --> 02:11:39.764]  Oh, yeah, Hillary's evil.
[02:11:41.105 --> 02:11:43.285]  You know, you're totally attached to the hip with this lady.
[02:11:44.145 --> 02:11:45.626]  She votes for everything you vote for.
[02:11:45.646 --> 02:11:49.187]  Electronic voting machines, open borders, gun control, the Iraq War.
[02:11:49.227 --> 02:11:50.767]  I mean, it just never ends.
[02:11:52.367 --> 02:11:52.947]  Take a few calls.
[02:11:52.967 --> 02:11:55.028]  I'm going to go into the news.
[02:11:55.088 --> 02:11:57.748]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Tennessee.
[02:11:57.828 --> 02:11:58.609]  John, go ahead.
[02:11:58.929 --> 02:11:59.449]  Hi, Alex.
[02:11:59.869 --> 02:12:00.349]  How's it going?
[02:12:01.002 --> 02:12:03.224]  Pretty good, considering everything.
[02:12:04.465 --> 02:12:11.732]  Eric Rudolph was hiding in Murphy, North Carolina, where the FBI and ATF bombed his cache of dynamite this week.
[02:12:12.632 --> 02:12:27.906]  My family owned land in Murphy, and our next-door neighbors were a DEA agent and Nazi Waffen-SS Baron Wernher von Braun, who, on the History Channel, genocided 25,000 slaves in Hitler's underground rocket bunker and
[02:12:28.703 --> 02:12:32.566]  Terror bombed London and Paris with his ICBM missiles.
[02:12:32.866 --> 02:12:34.867]  V-1 and V-6 and V-M.
[02:12:35.147 --> 02:12:43.013]  Yeah, and NASA and the CIA and the Pentagon loved von Braun and let him retire to the same county where Rudolph was hunted down.
[02:12:44.474 --> 02:12:50.898]  And, of course, Rudolph pled guilty this week, wavered his right to the show trial and jury nullification, which could have set him free.
[02:12:51.843 --> 02:12:57.207]  And any jury would be sympathetic to anyone trying to stop the genocide of 50 million American babies.
[02:12:57.347 --> 02:12:58.568]  Well, I'm going to stop you right there.
[02:12:58.669 --> 02:13:00.510]  I don't believe Rudolph carried out the bombings.
[02:13:02.111 --> 02:13:02.392]  Right.
[02:13:02.512 --> 02:13:08.336]  And is he a dumb patsy, or is he still employed by the Pentagon as a provocateur?
[02:13:08.897 --> 02:13:10.298]  No, I believe he's been tortured.
[02:13:11.149 --> 02:13:12.810]  Look, number one, you have to follow the M.O.
[02:13:12.830 --> 02:13:13.411]  of the whole case.
[02:13:13.431 --> 02:13:14.391]  Remember Richard Jewell?
[02:13:14.952 --> 02:13:16.333]  Yeah.
[02:13:16.573 --> 02:13:19.075]  He saw the FBI or ATF plant the bomb?
[02:13:19.535 --> 02:13:25.679]  Yeah, he saw a known FBI agent, excuse me, ATF agent, at the Olympic Park bombing plant the satchel.
[02:13:26.019 --> 02:13:28.401]  He told the police, so the FBI said, no, you did it.
[02:13:29.062 --> 02:13:29.802]  And they threatened him.
[02:13:29.822 --> 02:13:34.265]  They said, plead guilty or we're going to give you the death penalty.
[02:13:34.285 --> 02:13:35.346]  And he said, no, I'm innocent.
[02:13:36.067 --> 02:13:40.650]  And then so they dropped Jewel, then they tried to blame some other guy, then they moved on to Rudolph.
[02:13:40.731 --> 02:13:46.775]  Rudolph escaped and told people that we've talked to that they're trying to frame me.
[02:13:47.636 --> 02:13:49.837]  And I've looked at several of the bombings.
[02:13:49.857 --> 02:13:55.481]  People say, well, why would the BATF and other federal agencies want to bomb abortion clinics?
[02:13:55.541 --> 02:13:58.944]  Because at the time, peaceful pro-lifers were shutting them down.
[02:14:00.026 --> 02:14:02.329]  The Operation Rescue was winning.
[02:14:02.890 --> 02:14:07.476]  So by doing that they were able to pass racketeering laws or use racketeering laws with Butch Reno.
[02:14:08.431 --> 02:14:21.217]  And they were able to go in and start breaking arms, that's in my new film, breaking pro-lifers' arms, savagely with pleasure with nunchucks, twisting them until they break, macing women with babies, making women have miscarriages, you know, it just goes on and on.
[02:14:21.697 --> 02:14:22.997]  So that's why they did that.
[02:14:23.017 --> 02:14:24.878]  And then they have to blame somebody for it.
[02:14:25.479 --> 02:14:27.740]  Why not an anti-abortion activist like Rudolph?
[02:14:28.120 --> 02:14:33.002]  Well, 7,000 Americans are genocided every day by medical doctors in U.S.
[02:14:33.082 --> 02:14:33.682]  death camps.
[02:14:34.102 --> 02:14:35.443]  I mean, look at Terry Schiavo.
[02:14:36.347 --> 02:14:39.229]  There was only 100 protesters down there when there should have been 100,000.
[02:14:39.269 --> 02:14:42.031]  Well, you could have gone.
[02:14:42.051 --> 02:14:42.491]  Did you go?
[02:14:42.511 --> 02:14:45.213]  I'm disabled with no income.
[02:14:45.313 --> 02:14:47.195]  I don't want to criticize the 100.
[02:14:47.295 --> 02:14:48.636]  I would have loved to go, yes.
[02:14:49.897 --> 02:14:54.500]  That would have been a good vacation instead of going to Disney World, go down and try to save somebody's life.
[02:14:54.560 --> 02:14:57.782]  Well, I want to commend everybody that did go, and thank you for the call, John.
[02:14:58.723 --> 02:15:01.184]  Let's talk to Elias in Michigan.
[02:15:01.205 --> 02:15:02.145]  Elias, go ahead.
[02:15:02.165 --> 02:15:02.906]  All right.
[02:15:03.266 --> 02:15:03.706]  Hello.
[02:15:04.207 --> 02:15:04.627]  Pretty good.
[02:15:05.086 --> 02:15:05.526]  Been a while.
[02:15:06.006 --> 02:15:07.027]  Right.
[02:15:07.267 --> 02:15:12.029]  Now, listening to Springer, he says we have to pay our dues tomorrow.
[02:15:12.749 --> 02:15:17.031]  You know what I'm talking about?
[02:15:17.111 --> 02:15:17.711]  Yes.
[02:15:18.011 --> 02:15:22.453]  Pay them money they printed up for nothing, but by taking it from us, that adds value to it.
[02:15:22.973 --> 02:15:25.714]  In three hours, he said it a hundred times as he said it once.
[02:15:25.894 --> 02:15:27.675]  He's afraid to say taxes.
[02:15:27.795 --> 02:15:31.416]  He never said taxes in his three-hour program.
[02:15:33.717 --> 02:15:34.637]  So that's what it comes to.
[02:15:34.677 --> 02:15:36.298]  We only pay our dues.
[02:15:36.458 --> 02:15:37.698]  Well, of course, he's all for it.
[02:15:37.758 --> 02:15:39.578]  What are you doing listening to Springer?
[02:15:39.998 --> 02:15:42.219]  Well, there's nothing else on at that time.
[02:15:42.299 --> 02:15:43.959]  All the others have disappeared.
[02:15:43.979 --> 02:15:46.400]  Horowitz has disappeared.
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:47.860]  Pettis disappeared.
[02:15:48.400 --> 02:15:49.720]  How many others have all disappeared?
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:51.161]  There's nobody around at that time.
[02:15:51.461 --> 02:15:52.101]  They're all gone.
[02:15:52.681 --> 02:15:52.941]  Yeah.
[02:15:53.181 --> 02:15:54.121]  They're all gone.
[02:15:54.201 --> 02:15:54.581]  I don't know.
[02:15:54.841 --> 02:16:00.363]  They claim they got death threats, I suppose, or things, you know, various things.
[02:16:00.403 --> 02:16:02.263]  What are you talking about?
[02:16:02.796 --> 02:16:03.036]  Pardon?
[02:16:03.737 --> 02:16:04.598]  Who got death threats?
[02:16:04.959 --> 02:16:05.740]  Well, that's what they say.
[02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:07.762]  I think Horowitz said that before he went off.
[02:16:09.745 --> 02:16:10.786]  He used to be on the shortwave.
[02:16:10.806 --> 02:16:11.707]  He took them off in the morning.
[02:16:12.107 --> 02:16:12.548]  Yeah.
[02:16:13.009 --> 02:16:14.510]  And he's been long gone.
[02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:15.612]  He was on this network.
[02:16:15.652 --> 02:16:17.754]  When I talked to him, he just said he was moving to Hawaii.
[02:16:18.015 --> 02:16:19.877]  Well, I think that he got death threats.
[02:16:20.563 --> 02:16:20.923]  I don't know.
[02:16:20.983 --> 02:16:22.324]  I never heard him say that.
[02:16:22.584 --> 02:16:23.204]  I believe so.
[02:16:23.364 --> 02:16:25.905]  Because he was the guy who was going on... Well, he didn't tell me that.
[02:16:25.925 --> 02:16:26.505]  I asked him why.
[02:16:26.525 --> 02:16:28.286]  He just said he was moving to Hawaii.
[02:16:28.366 --> 02:16:32.367]  Well, his song, Son of a Bush, I don't think went over too well with the powers.
[02:16:32.507 --> 02:16:33.588]  I think he got it.
[02:16:34.028 --> 02:16:35.048]  I think he got it in the neck.
[02:16:35.868 --> 02:16:36.829]  And that was the end of him.
[02:16:36.869 --> 02:16:38.149]  His song, Son of a Bush?
[02:16:38.789 --> 02:16:39.010]  Oh, yeah.
[02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:41.490]  I think that's a Public Enemy song.
[02:16:41.831 --> 02:16:43.091]  Well, you have that song on every day.
[02:16:44.068 --> 02:16:44.569]  You say it.
[02:16:45.129 --> 02:16:47.091]  All right, well, thank you for the call, sir.
[02:16:47.131 --> 02:16:48.492]  I really appreciate it.
[02:16:48.532 --> 02:16:55.838]  We'll take one final call on the other side of this quick break from Joe in Ohio, and that's it.
[02:16:55.858 --> 02:16:56.639]  I'm covering the news.
[02:16:58.480 --> 02:16:59.661]  We're going to cover some news here.
[02:16:59.802 --> 02:17:01.023]  We're going to cover some information.
[02:17:01.063 --> 02:17:04.866]  It's always fun to take calls, but we're going to cover some news when we get back.
[02:17:05.945 --> 02:17:09.207]  I want to get a little bit more into oil prices and what the IMF said last week.
[02:17:09.227 --> 02:17:10.428]  I want to get into hate crimes.
[02:17:10.448 --> 02:17:11.789]  I want to get into what Israel's saying.
[02:17:11.829 --> 02:17:13.810]  Hey, here's the evidence of weapons of mass destruction.
[02:17:13.870 --> 02:17:14.891]  Attack, attack, attack.
[02:17:15.271 --> 02:17:16.452]  They've had their war counseled.
[02:17:17.392 --> 02:17:20.494]  Clinton finds his new surrogate family.
[02:17:22.136 --> 02:17:25.238]  Four more high schools pay students to tattle on their classmates.
[02:17:27.759 --> 02:17:29.780]  All part of the Stasi-ization.
[02:17:30.621 --> 02:17:32.022]  If that's the proper way to say it.
[02:17:33.604 --> 02:17:38.588]  The Sovietization, that rolls better on the tongue, of this country.
[02:17:38.949 --> 02:17:41.051]  Everything un-American is now pro-American.
[02:17:42.171 --> 02:17:43.413]  Hating America is good.
[02:17:45.875 --> 02:17:49.538]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:17:49.938 --> 02:17:55.383]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:17:55.823 --> 02:17:56.924]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:17:56.944 --> 02:18:00.988]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:18:01.628 --> 02:18:14.919]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:18:15.439 --> 02:18:20.743]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:18:21.063 --> 02:18:26.948]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:18:27.568 --> 02:18:27.628]  1-800-686-2237
[02:18:45.382 --> 02:18:46.983]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:18:47.123 --> 02:18:51.224]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:18:51.364 --> 02:18:54.265]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:18:54.325 --> 02:19:01.047]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:19:01.227 --> 02:19:04.228]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:19:04.428 --> 02:19:06.829]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:19:06.949 --> 02:19:14.851]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:19:15.131 --> 02:19:17.092]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:19:48.158 --> 02:19:55.544]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:19:56.625 --> 02:20:06.313]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:20:07.193 --> 02:20:13.799]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[02:20:44.562 --> 02:20:47.943]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:20:48.183 --> 02:20:48.503]  Why?
[02:20:48.523 --> 02:20:51.463]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[02:21:31.781 --> 02:21:33.603]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[02:21:50.225 --> 02:21:57.668]  During that last segment, I was a little bit condescending to Elias in Michigan.
[02:21:57.688 --> 02:22:01.510]  You know, why do you listen to Jerry Springer on the radio?
[02:22:03.190 --> 02:22:04.051]  That was hypocritical.
[02:22:04.091 --> 02:22:08.452]  I mean, I just... Because I listen to mainstream talk show hosts when I'm out driving around, too.
[02:22:08.793 --> 02:22:10.313]  You should monitor what they're up to.
[02:22:10.393 --> 02:22:14.715]  It's just... I was thinking of Jerry Springer of the TV show.
[02:22:16.525 --> 02:22:18.626]  I probably watched that twice in my life.
[02:22:18.686 --> 02:22:22.288]  The most horrible, stupid, mindlessness.
[02:22:22.528 --> 02:22:26.469]  I mean, I was on an exercise bike yesterday.
[02:22:26.489 --> 02:22:32.692]  The gym, they had a TV on with some show, one of those shows.
[02:22:32.712 --> 02:22:34.313]  I mean, how could anybody watch that?
[02:22:36.714 --> 02:22:38.575]  But millions and millions and millions do.
[02:22:38.875 --> 02:22:42.656]  And so, being a hypocrite, saying, what are you doing listening to Jerry Springer?
[02:22:43.837 --> 02:22:45.758]  I've never heard him, and I really don't care, but...
[02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:49.862]  It is hypocritical because I listen to mainstream talk radio, too.
[02:22:49.882 --> 02:22:52.242]  I mean, I guess you could call me mainstream talk radio.
[02:22:52.282 --> 02:22:55.003]  I'm on a lot of AM and FM stations around the country.
[02:22:57.184 --> 02:23:00.325]  And quite popular, so I guess I'm mainstream.
[02:23:00.385 --> 02:23:02.586]  I guess the worm has turned, as they say.
[02:23:03.186 --> 02:23:10.588]  It's getting more and more mainstream to talk about the New World Order because people are realizing it's real, it's true, this stuff is happening.
[02:23:11.630 --> 02:23:18.253]  All right, I'm going to go to the news for a while, and then I'll go to Joe in Ohio, and maybe a few others after him if I have time.
[02:23:18.273 --> 02:23:21.254]  But I'm going to go ahead and start covering news right now.
[02:23:22.755 --> 02:23:35.060]  I'm sure you heard last week the IMF said, we're going to run out of oil, it's going to get more and more expensive by 2010, and during that period it will get even more expensive.
[02:23:36.441 --> 02:23:39.282]  But they went on to actually be honest in their report
[02:23:40.626 --> 02:23:52.091]  Saying, strong growth and high deficits in the United States compared with lackluster growth in Europe and Japan have resulted in global imbalances that so far the financial system has been able to cope with.
[02:23:52.211 --> 02:23:59.435]  But if oil prices, inflation, and currency movements, see, currency movements, that is our dollar plunging.
[02:24:01.036 --> 02:24:04.497]  And that's why, one of the big reasons oil costs so much more now.
[02:24:05.218 --> 02:24:08.079]  You know, an 89-90% increase in the last couple years.
[02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:11.531]  Because the dollar's been going down in value.
[02:24:11.571 --> 02:24:12.893]  It takes more of those dollars to buy it.
[02:24:13.613 --> 02:24:18.217]  And part of that number, also, a large portion of it, is oil companies have just jacked up prices.
[02:24:18.897 --> 02:24:21.119]  It is not because of scarcity, my friends.
[02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:23.561]  I mean, that's just not true.
[02:24:24.462 --> 02:24:30.447]  But if oil prices, inflation, and currency movements trigger abrupt changes, the situation could deteriorate dramatically.
[02:24:31.508 --> 02:24:37.533]  Ratio, or Ratto, told the German business daily, Hendelsblatt,
[02:24:38.308 --> 02:24:47.035]  Rising demand for petrol coupled with lack of refining capacity in the United States, the world's biggest oil consumer, is one factor blamed by analysts for the record high prices.
[02:24:47.075 --> 02:24:47.996]  And that's just not true.
[02:24:49.537 --> 02:24:55.702]  By surging demand in emerging economies headed by China and India, it is also high up on the list.
[02:24:57.904 --> 02:25:02.367]  But the main reason is the deterioration of the dollar.
[02:25:03.028 --> 02:25:05.510]  You'll see a headline like the dollar rebounds.
[02:25:05.550 --> 02:25:06.831]  Yeah, like one cent.
[02:25:09.005 --> 02:25:09.545]  It does that.
[02:25:10.366 --> 02:25:12.886]  But if you look at a three-year trend, it's going straight down.
[02:25:12.986 --> 02:25:14.047]  And there are spikes.
[02:25:14.107 --> 02:25:15.187]  It looks like a mountain range.
[02:25:15.507 --> 02:25:16.508]  We're going down the mountain.
[02:25:17.128 --> 02:25:24.370]  So it'll spike back up a few cents, then go down four cents, and spike up five cents, and then go down eight cents, and then it just goes up and down, up and down.
[02:25:24.410 --> 02:25:26.831]  But the trend is down, down, down, down, down.
[02:25:28.672 --> 02:25:34.594]  And now there's talk of a rally and buying more dollars now by people that have been dumping them.
[02:25:35.254 --> 02:25:37.655]  The problem with that is our government's printing so many dollars...
[02:25:38.764 --> 02:25:46.966]  And these third world countries can't absorb them all, but there is definitely a bottom to all of this within view.
[02:25:47.526 --> 02:25:55.169]  And they say the dollar could plunge to 40 cents on the euro, and if that happens, you're not going to be happy cameras.
[02:25:56.629 --> 02:26:03.691]  And this will manifest itself in energy prices, in real estate prices, in basic commodity prices.
[02:26:04.702 --> 02:26:14.524]  Meanwhile, though, since the CD player costs $5 and the DVD player costs $30, it gives you the illusion of not having inflation.
[02:26:14.584 --> 02:26:16.704]  No, just the slave goods are getting cheaper and cheaper.
[02:26:19.125 --> 02:26:27.126]  And Isaac Asimov, strangely enough, had his own economic theory on that, which, frankly, I see in play today.
[02:26:28.907 --> 02:26:29.127]  Let's...
[02:26:31.167 --> 02:26:32.267]  Get back into the news here.
[02:26:32.647 --> 02:26:33.568]  This is out of the BBC.
[02:26:33.588 --> 02:26:35.148]  I already mentioned this earlier, but listen to this.
[02:26:35.528 --> 02:26:38.069]  Fans charged after Pope Jeering.
[02:26:38.929 --> 02:26:47.712]  Six football supporters have been charged with sectarian hate crime following Sunday's Scottish Cup semifinal between Hearts and Celtics.
[02:26:49.312 --> 02:26:54.814]  And I'm sure you heard that when they had the moment of silence, the one minute of silence, a few people booed.
[02:26:56.420 --> 02:27:02.963]  Well, the camera zoomed in, caught them, and they're being charged with hate crimes, and they're going to serve jail time for this.
[02:27:05.704 --> 02:27:08.566]  And a lot of you are saying, well, good, don't be mean to Papa.
[02:27:09.146 --> 02:27:10.226]  Don't be mean to the Pope.
[02:27:12.747 --> 02:27:14.528]  Because, you know, I'm a Catholic, and how dare you?
[02:27:15.008 --> 02:27:16.149]  See, you fell into the trap.
[02:27:16.249 --> 02:27:20.471]  Now, next time you don't like something and you boo it, you're going to get arrested.
[02:27:21.144 --> 02:27:26.546]  If you've got free speech, if you've got a First Amendment in this country, then you've got to support it for everybody.
[02:27:27.926 --> 02:27:32.728]  And this is just one more example of hate crimes out of control.
[02:27:35.709 --> 02:27:36.609]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.089 --> 02:27:38.710]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:42.291]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.862 --> 02:27:53.347]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:53.767 --> 02:27:58.311]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:58.451 --> 02:28:05.276]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.657 --> 02:28:11.762]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:11.902 --> 02:28:13.123]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:13.303 --> 02:28:13.763]  We're good to go.

[02:29:45.868 --> 02:29:51.372]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:29:51.532 --> 02:29:52.593]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:29:52.713 --> 02:29:53.594]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:29:53.694 --> 02:29:56.536]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:29:56.736 --> 02:30:01.600]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?

[02:30:12.969 --> 02:30:17.814]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:30:18.074 --> 02:30:21.198]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[02:30:21.318 --> 02:30:26.744]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:30:26.824 --> 02:30:27.565]  Try Nobio.
[02:30:27.705 --> 02:30:28.686]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:30:29.847 --> 02:30:32.750]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:30:32.930 --> 02:30:35.792]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[02:30:35.992 --> 02:30:38.434]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[02:30:38.615 --> 02:30:41.897]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NoBO.
[02:30:42.097 --> 02:30:42.898]  That's no-bo.com.
[02:31:00.071 --> 02:31:09.975]  All right, if I start pontificating, we're not going to have time to cover all this news.
[02:31:11.396 --> 02:31:17.178]  And there's no way to really pick out what's most important out of it, so I'll just grab the next thing out of the stack as we go along here.
[02:31:19.952 --> 02:31:20.572]  Here's another one.
[02:31:20.632 --> 02:31:24.193]  Radio host fired for wondering if the Pope went to heaven.
[02:31:25.253 --> 02:31:27.494]  And this is out of local Channel 10 News.
[02:31:29.434 --> 02:31:42.838]  Pittsburgh, an evangelical Christian talk show host who questioned the benefits of the Catholic Church and entertained a caller's question about whether the late Pope, John Paul II, would go to heaven, has been fired.
[02:31:43.991 --> 02:31:54.157]  Marty Mento, 39, a senior pastor at the New Castle Church, was fired Friday after three years as the host on Word FM in Pittsburgh.
[02:31:54.718 --> 02:31:57.679]  He said he was told that he was alienating listeners.
[02:31:58.860 --> 02:32:00.461]  So there's a little self-enforcement.
[02:32:02.002 --> 02:32:08.506]  Six idiots, because they're idiots for going to a soccer game, those little hooligans over there in England,
[02:32:09.994 --> 02:32:13.635]  They boo during the one minute of silence.
[02:32:13.655 --> 02:32:14.315]  They get arrested.
[02:32:16.176 --> 02:32:18.217]  And I'm not a Catholic, but that's distasteful.
[02:32:18.657 --> 02:32:19.677]  But it's their right to do it.
[02:32:20.117 --> 02:32:21.078]  Oh no, you're arrested.
[02:32:21.438 --> 02:32:27.019]  And over here, top show host who's a Protestant, criticizes the Pope, it says, very mildly.
[02:32:27.940 --> 02:32:28.840]  And he's fired.
[02:32:29.660 --> 02:32:35.582]  And boy, I have been a guest on Word, that station, many times that I remember.
[02:32:36.354 --> 02:32:38.315]  So I guess I won't be allowed on.
[02:32:38.335 --> 02:32:39.556]  I don't think I was on with that host.
[02:32:42.337 --> 02:32:44.979]  So I guess now that's your new self-enforcement.
[02:32:45.019 --> 02:32:58.546]  And I've noticed on KIXL here in Austin, Texas, the local Christian station, not KCXL that we're on in Kansas City, but KIXL,
[02:33:00.110 --> 02:33:02.271]  No group criticizes any other group at all.
[02:33:02.351 --> 02:33:05.533]  It's just all, which is interesting, which is kind of a dangerous trend.
[02:33:05.573 --> 02:33:08.856]  And callers are screened out and not allowed to criticize anybody.
[02:33:08.936 --> 02:33:09.976]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[02:33:12.418 --> 02:33:18.382]  And at the same time, I mentioned this yesterday, but you really cannot spend enough time on it.
[02:33:19.143 --> 02:33:21.384]  Clinton finds his surrogate family.
[02:33:21.484 --> 02:33:23.966]  And let me just read some of this.
[02:33:27.328 --> 02:33:28.109]  Just part of it.
[02:33:30.123 --> 02:33:32.244]  Clinton finds his surrogate family.
[02:33:33.104 --> 02:33:37.225]  Growing friendship with Bush clan pays political dividend to all.
[02:33:38.325 --> 02:33:41.126]  This is out of the Boston Globe, Peter S. Kanellos.
[02:33:41.846 --> 02:33:47.868]  Born after his father's death, Bill Clinton has spent his life searching for connection.
[02:33:48.688 --> 02:33:54.090]  His need for approval was arguably the yearning that propelled him all the way to the White House.
[02:33:54.130 --> 02:33:55.090]  Now let me stop right there.
[02:33:56.969 --> 02:34:00.471]  His mother was a lady of the night, a lady of pleasure.
[02:34:02.192 --> 02:34:11.439]  And the man that they connected him to was involved in organized crime and was not his real father.
[02:34:12.779 --> 02:34:22.686]  And we've got real evidence on this that it was one of the Rockefeller progeny that got this particular prostitute pregnant.
[02:34:22.786 --> 02:34:24.167]  And the globalists are big on that.
[02:34:24.187 --> 02:34:25.688]  They like to have a lot of illegitimate children.
[02:34:27.273 --> 02:34:29.435]  That they can then move around as pawns later in life.
[02:34:29.915 --> 02:34:43.424]  And I saw evidence of this, not just from the documents, but back when he gave David Rockefeller the American Freedom Medal, the one that Bush just gave to Tenet a few months ago.
[02:34:44.625 --> 02:34:46.826]  And he started crying.
[02:34:47.667 --> 02:34:55.352]  And he said, I just want to tell you all that there were only two people in 1969 that thought I could be president.
[02:34:56.010 --> 02:34:58.091]  And he broke up for real, real crying.
[02:34:59.491 --> 02:35:02.712]  My mama and David Rockefeller.
[02:35:02.772 --> 02:35:03.772]  Thank you, David.
[02:35:06.373 --> 02:35:08.513]  Rockefeller gets up there and goes, it's okay, son.
[02:35:09.554 --> 02:35:12.875]  Of course, from the info I've got, that's his uncle.
[02:35:14.715 --> 02:35:17.516]  But that's kind of his death.
[02:35:19.937 --> 02:35:21.157]  So let's just move on from there.
[02:35:22.397 --> 02:35:25.298]  Now it appears Clinton has found his surrogate family.
[02:35:26.115 --> 02:35:29.916]  He is part of a sprawling clan, legendary for its warmth and unity.
[02:35:30.777 --> 02:35:35.178]  It is a clan that is accustomed to acquiring surrogate sons and daughters.
[02:35:35.798 --> 02:35:38.639]  Adoption has become a part of its strength.
[02:35:38.839 --> 02:35:41.300]  Clinton has become a member of the Bush clan.
[02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:45.301]  Yes, he always was, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:45.321 --> 02:35:48.882]  I mean, I was telling you this back when it was like space alien language.
[02:35:49.523 --> 02:35:50.423]  But it's just the facts.
[02:35:51.138 --> 02:35:55.980]  Last week in Rome for the Pope's funeral, the clan sat lined up in a pew.
[02:35:56.020 --> 02:36:06.605]  Laura, W, Dad, surrogate daughter Condoleezza, looking like a ringwraith, and Bill, all seeming more at ease than most families on Christmas Eve.
[02:36:08.205 --> 02:36:19.590]  Clinton may have looked a little out of place, like a great Dane who thinks he belongs to a family of dachshunds, but his contented expression suggested he was exactly where he wanted to be.
[02:36:20.678 --> 02:36:26.283]  Like many relationships in public life, the friendship between Bill Clinton and the Bush family is both genuine and opportunistic.
[02:36:27.124 --> 02:36:31.587]  At the highest levels of power, personal and political desires tend to merge.
[02:36:31.888 --> 02:36:33.889]  The person and the job become one.
[02:36:36.291 --> 02:36:42.036]  Folks, they were hanging out and going on little vacations together before the election of 1993.
[02:36:42.076 --> 02:36:43.277]  That's mainstream news.
[02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:57.093]  Eleven separate documented meetings, including spending up to three days together at resorts, a year before the election.
[02:36:59.794 --> 02:37:14.178]  We know MENA was run by George Herbert Walker, and it was run by our good little friend Oliver North, and we've had Terry Reed, CIA agent there, unloading the cocaine.
[02:37:14.198 --> 02:37:15.158]  I've had other people on.
[02:37:15.478 --> 02:37:16.199]  It's admitted.
[02:37:16.539 --> 02:37:17.599]  They made films about it.
[02:37:18.263 --> 02:37:22.424]  But in the MENA cover-up and Clinton Chronicle films, they don't mention the Bush connection.
[02:37:23.304 --> 02:37:26.664]  Sometimes $30 million a day of cocaine through that one airport.
[02:37:27.065 --> 02:37:30.705]  And the Bushes, that was their operation, and Clinton got a cut of it.
[02:37:31.885 --> 02:37:33.806]  And George Bush Sr.
[02:37:33.846 --> 02:37:38.746]  described himself in a 1988 interview as a Rockefeller Republican.
[02:37:42.947 --> 02:37:45.448]  Clinton is a minion of the Rockefellers.
[02:37:45.488 --> 02:37:47.428]  I mean, they're just all peas in a pod.
[02:37:48.160 --> 02:37:49.840]  They've always been peas in a pod.
[02:37:50.661 --> 02:37:52.041]  And now they're inseparable.
[02:37:52.781 --> 02:37:56.302]  Bill Clinton was protected by George Bush after George Bush was elected.
[02:37:56.542 --> 02:37:57.863]  He blocked Dan Burton's committee.
[02:37:57.883 --> 02:37:59.203]  He said, leave Bill Clinton alone.
[02:38:01.624 --> 02:38:02.464]  He's done all of it.
[02:38:02.484 --> 02:38:04.444]  He's made Clinton's documents secret.
[02:38:05.165 --> 02:38:06.045]  He's done all of it.
[02:38:06.445 --> 02:38:17.548]  And still, when I heard Rush Limbaugh, because he's on right after I go off the air, I get in my car a lot of days and tune over and listen to it if I'm not listening to somebody else like Jack Blood or something.
[02:38:18.374 --> 02:38:23.256]  And I tuned in, and there was Limbaugh going, Oh, these evil liberals trying to claim the Bushes.
[02:38:23.276 --> 02:38:24.176]  Look how bad they are.
[02:38:24.576 --> 02:38:26.237]  No mention of the Bushes doing this.
[02:38:27.097 --> 02:38:28.357]  And look at Bush and Kerry.
[02:38:28.797 --> 02:38:29.297]  Cousins.
[02:38:29.438 --> 02:38:30.618]  Members of the same group.
[02:38:30.678 --> 02:38:32.138]  Same secret society.
[02:38:32.198 --> 02:38:33.059]  Same policies.
[02:38:33.699 --> 02:38:34.659]  Just different rhetoric.
[02:38:36.940 --> 02:38:40.101]  And it goes on to basically say that Bill Clinton thinks that George Sr.
[02:38:40.141 --> 02:38:43.702]  is his father, and it's disgusting.
[02:38:45.282 --> 02:38:46.763]  It is totally disgusting.
[02:38:47.719 --> 02:38:58.307]  But neocons engage in this alchemy and still act like Hillary and Clinton are fighting with the Bushes, and we've got to really get behind Bush, and don't you criticize him, he's of the Lord!
[02:39:00.269 --> 02:39:04.632]  Bushes, we're so blessed to have him, he just, he's so good!
[02:39:04.652 --> 02:39:07.094]  Oh yeah!
[02:39:08.294 --> 02:39:21.577]  Open borders, federally manipulated toll roads going up everywhere, appointing all these pro-abortion, anti-gun people everywhere that are energetically going after the Second Amendment, signing on to UNESCO, something Reagan got us out of.
[02:39:21.597 --> 02:39:23.237]  I mean, that could go on for hours.
[02:39:24.098 --> 02:39:26.198]  Taking all the restrictions off supercomputers.
[02:39:26.478 --> 02:39:28.479]  Clinton sent a few supercomputers and got in trouble.
[02:39:28.739 --> 02:39:31.699]  Bush takes all restrictions off, and boy, you don't hear the neocons talk about it.
[02:39:33.540 --> 02:39:34.120]  It's sick.
[02:39:35.740 --> 02:39:37.421]  Because they're all together.
[02:39:37.481 --> 02:39:38.321]  It is a crew.
[02:39:38.361 --> 02:39:39.221]  It is a clan.
[02:39:39.822 --> 02:39:43.343]  It is a joke to them.
[02:39:44.723 --> 02:39:45.644]  It is staged.
[02:39:46.164 --> 02:39:51.806]  And until Republicans and Democrats get this through their heads, things are only going to get worse.
[02:39:53.387 --> 02:39:54.207]  Alright, continuing.
[02:39:55.467 --> 02:40:00.429]  Israel presents aerial photos of Iran's nuclear sites to Bush.
[02:40:01.350 --> 02:40:01.970]  Jerusalem.
[02:40:02.830 --> 02:40:03.911]  This came out yesterday.
[02:40:04.071 --> 02:40:14.056]  Ariel Sharon's military attaché presented aerial photos of Iranian nuclear installations during the Israeli Prime Minister's summit with U.S.
[02:40:14.116 --> 02:40:15.457]  President George W. Bush.
[02:40:15.817 --> 02:40:17.298]  Israeli Public Radio reported.
[02:40:18.719 --> 02:40:25.502]  Now, isn't it interesting that they always use the term nuclear?
[02:40:26.743 --> 02:40:29.265]  So I guess then it means nuclear weapon?
[02:40:29.425 --> 02:40:30.045]  No, it doesn't.
[02:40:31.096 --> 02:40:33.257]  UT's got several reactors.
[02:40:33.297 --> 02:40:35.937]  I know they've got one good-sized one up at the research facility.
[02:40:37.418 --> 02:40:42.599]  Could the foreign news report we've got nuclear and imply there's weapons in Austin?
[02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:44.240]  It's ridiculous.
[02:40:44.940 --> 02:40:47.541]  But they know the general public just hears that word nuclear.
[02:40:48.501 --> 02:40:55.043]  General Gavin Gallen, who accompanied Sharon to Monday's talks at Bush's office,
[02:40:56.098 --> 02:41:05.810]  Hollywood set, the Texas Ranch, I'm sorry, presented the photos as well as information gathered by the Israeli intelligence services on Tehran's nuclear program.
[02:41:06.831 --> 02:41:13.620]  The radio, which does not give details of how the photos were taken, so the images prove that the Iranian nuclear program was a very advanced stage.
[02:41:15.457 --> 02:41:18.018]  Well, funny, the IAEA has been there.
[02:41:18.618 --> 02:41:25.101]  Again, this sets the precedent where the hawks are on the side of attacking, and then even if you go with the liberal view, it's, well, let the UN run your country.
[02:41:25.401 --> 02:41:26.521]  See, end of sovereignty.
[02:41:27.622 --> 02:41:29.723]  See how we've already been legitimizing that?
[02:41:30.263 --> 02:41:31.643]  Even in the debate against Bush.
[02:41:32.084 --> 02:41:33.144]  Either way, the globalists win.
[02:41:33.644 --> 02:41:35.305]  The IAEA's been all over the place.
[02:41:35.345 --> 02:41:36.125]  There's nothing there.
[02:41:36.205 --> 02:41:36.745]  It's peaceful.
[02:41:37.106 --> 02:41:38.126]  The Russians are building it.
[02:41:39.051 --> 02:41:51.615]  White House spokesman Scott McClellan confirmed the two leaders had talked about their shared concern about Iran's intentions with their nuclear program, but denied that they had discussed the possibility of a preemptive military strike by Israel.
[02:41:52.035 --> 02:41:56.777]  Yeah, it's more like a, here's a picture of you and your boyfriend, Gannon Bush.
[02:41:57.237 --> 02:41:58.737]  You don't want this going on, do you?
[02:41:59.618 --> 02:42:00.298]  That's more like it.
[02:42:00.922 --> 02:42:13.452]  The United States and Israel have both accused Iran of using its atomic energy program as cover for a plan to develop nuclear arms, a charge denied by Tehran, which says it needs nuclear power as an alternative energy source.
[02:42:13.893 --> 02:42:16.375]  Well, so is the IAEA.
[02:42:17.135 --> 02:42:19.898]  They are five years away from warheads.
[02:42:22.100 --> 02:42:23.921]  But our government isn't worried about Pakistan.
[02:42:25.042 --> 02:42:26.003]  Not a whole bunch of them.
[02:42:26.798 --> 02:42:27.959]  That missiles are going to hit the U.S.?
[02:42:27.979 --> 02:42:28.979]  They're not worried about North Korea?
[02:42:28.999 --> 02:42:30.039]  They're not worried about China?
[02:42:30.139 --> 02:42:31.020]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:42:31.580 --> 02:42:33.921]  They're worried about Iran because they're a pushover.
[02:42:34.481 --> 02:42:39.323]  They're a bunch of bullies that want to go in to pushover countries because they are pushovers.
[02:42:40.844 --> 02:42:43.405]  But it's a threat to the news center, Alex.
[02:42:44.305 --> 02:42:46.386]  What are you, Al-Qaeda?
[02:42:48.207 --> 02:42:49.907]  No, our government made Al-Qaeda.
[02:42:50.287 --> 02:42:51.428]  I'm not with Al-Qaeda.
[02:42:51.528 --> 02:42:51.908]  You are.
[02:42:52.528 --> 02:42:54.849]  When you support this government, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[02:42:55.610 --> 02:42:56.590]  Because this isn't our government.
[02:42:58.810 --> 02:43:00.150]  They're dismantling this country.
[02:43:00.230 --> 02:43:01.051]  I love America.
[02:43:03.031 --> 02:43:09.952]  Well, 18 killed and a bunch wounded in the latest bombing.
[02:43:09.972 --> 02:43:11.893]  Another tragedy.
[02:43:13.293 --> 02:43:19.714]  Today, a pair of car bombs exploded near government offices in Iraq, killing 18 people and wounding three dozen others.
[02:43:21.835 --> 02:43:27.676]  While insurgent attacks against the nation's nascent security forces left at least eight others dead, officials said.
[02:43:27.716 --> 02:43:28.096]  Man, it's just
[02:43:29.002 --> 02:43:31.584]  All-time record bads are getting worse every day.
[02:43:31.624 --> 02:43:32.545]  It's like our trade deficit.
[02:43:32.805 --> 02:43:33.746]  It's worse every month.
[02:43:34.026 --> 02:43:35.707]  The death toll in Iraq gets worse every month.
[02:43:35.727 --> 02:43:38.149]  But they tell you, oh, we've victory.
[02:43:38.189 --> 02:43:39.890]  We've done a great job.
[02:43:43.893 --> 02:43:44.354]  Amazing.
[02:43:45.695 --> 02:43:47.196]  Here's the really scary news.
[02:43:49.357 --> 02:43:51.899]  And this is in the New Scientist and several other publications.
[02:43:54.201 --> 02:43:56.723]  Just giving you some background information on this briefly.
[02:43:58.087 --> 02:44:05.569]  Last year, they tried to pass a law in England, and we have the BBC, London Telegraph, and other news reports on this.
[02:44:05.589 --> 02:44:09.090]  They calmly reported it like it was a good idea and needed to happen.
[02:44:11.310 --> 02:44:25.934]  There's a new vaccine that creates plaques in the neurotransmitter receptor points in the human brain that block endorphin type of exchanges.
[02:44:27.378 --> 02:44:32.983]  And they say it blocks cocaine, heroin, nicotine, every other narcotic-type drug.
[02:44:33.263 --> 02:44:34.964]  Nicotine does affect those same receptors.
[02:44:36.566 --> 02:44:37.927]  So you won't ever have a problem.
[02:44:37.967 --> 02:44:39.007]  You won't like cigarettes.
[02:44:39.328 --> 02:44:40.589]  It'll be like smoking hay.
[02:44:41.289 --> 02:44:42.811]  You won't like heroin.
[02:44:42.831 --> 02:44:43.691]  You won't like cocaine.
[02:44:43.711 --> 02:44:54.340]  Of course, you, when you run that touchdown or get to date with that girl you always wanted to date or when you have that first child or when you get that big bonus at work, you're not going to feel good.
[02:44:56.726 --> 02:44:58.287]  The studies actually admit it.
[02:44:58.667 --> 02:45:00.468]  But it's a good trade-off, they say.
[02:45:00.508 --> 02:45:01.069]  It's worth it.
[02:45:01.089 --> 02:45:03.650]  To not have our children use drugs.
[02:45:07.232 --> 02:45:08.953]  It actually is a chemical lobotomy.
[02:45:08.973 --> 02:45:10.975]  It's a biological lobotomy.
[02:45:11.495 --> 02:45:12.175]  It's a virus.
[02:45:12.215 --> 02:45:13.776]  They inject you with a virus.
[02:45:16.158 --> 02:45:18.939]  It actually creates plaques in your brain.
[02:45:18.979 --> 02:45:20.300]  That's got to be good for you.
[02:45:20.941 --> 02:45:24.643]  They were a few votes short in the House of Commons...
[02:45:25.800 --> 02:45:28.582]  Of passing it and forcibly injecting every child in the country.
[02:45:28.882 --> 02:45:30.042]  Why, you're not for the children.
[02:45:30.643 --> 02:45:33.664]  Dying from... Drugs, are you?
[02:45:34.705 --> 02:45:36.146]  Let us put the virus into you.
[02:45:36.166 --> 02:45:38.867]  I mean, think of... That's a science fiction nightmare.
[02:45:39.227 --> 02:45:40.888]  Well, here's the newest one from the new scientist.
[02:45:41.228 --> 02:45:43.590]  Will cancer vaccine get to all women?
[02:45:43.610 --> 02:45:45.391]  Oh, will we be able to get this?
[02:45:46.531 --> 02:45:54.276]  Deaths from cervical cancer... And it's clear that these groups of viruses came from polio inoculations, but let's ignore that.
[02:45:54.296 --> 02:45:54.976]  The government before...
[02:45:55.985 --> 02:45:56.325]  Oh, okay.
[02:46:16.440 --> 02:46:21.864]  The trouble is that the human papillomavirus, HPV, is sexually transmitted.
[02:46:22.085 --> 02:46:33.914]  So to prevent infection, girls will have to be vaccinated before they become sexually active, which could be a problem in many countries where Nobel Prize winners are saying you're putting poison in it and the people are refusing.
[02:46:33.934 --> 02:46:39.418]  I remember a report like three years ago, the UN went in and injected all these kids and started dropping dead.
[02:46:40.059 --> 02:46:43.802]  So the next town, the parents would hack their children's arms off with machetes and
[02:46:44.540 --> 02:46:45.621]  Right after the trucks left.
[02:46:45.641 --> 02:46:46.701]  Of course, that didn't save them.
[02:46:48.002 --> 02:46:56.326]  In the U.S., for instance, religious groups are getting up to oppose vaccination despite a survey showing that 80% of patients favor vaccinating their daughters.
[02:46:57.147 --> 02:47:02.290]  Abstinence is the best way to prevent HPV, says Bridget Mauer of the Family Research Council.
[02:47:03.590 --> 02:47:10.234]  The point of where all this is going is that they're talking about making it the law that you have to take this.
[02:47:10.714 --> 02:47:13.876]  And there are literally hundreds of new vaccines that they develop each year.
[02:47:14.935 --> 02:47:20.579]  And they've gone from 15 vaccines 10 years ago, they try to make you take it to school, up to like 35 now.
[02:47:21.780 --> 02:47:31.107]  Just the mercury load alone, and they haven't taken it out of all of them, they've actually increased it in some, mercury load alone, it causes unbelievable, irreparable harm to the cerebral cortex.
[02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:34.950]  And not to mention all the other things they've been caught putting in the vaccine.
[02:47:35.010 --> 02:47:44.277]  So, you want to trust a government that's been caught nerve-gassing its own troops to test it and killing people on the New York subway in 68 and all the things we mentioned first hour?
[02:47:45.245 --> 02:47:49.606]  Giving uranium to pregnant wives of GIs and their vitamins to see what it'd do to them?
[02:47:50.147 --> 02:47:51.367]  You want to trust these people.
[02:47:53.147 --> 02:47:54.248]  You want to take this shot.
[02:47:57.749 --> 02:48:01.230]  But the problem is, this is what the tyranny is about, so they can force all this on us.
[02:48:02.550 --> 02:48:14.714]  And again, clearly, this papillomavirus and the SV40 and a whole class of these are all linked to contaminated, and I say they did it on purpose, vaccines.
[02:48:15.680 --> 02:48:22.205]  They've found hepatitis vaccines made in the last five years that have got this in it when that's not even involved in the manufacture.
[02:48:23.647 --> 02:48:24.307]  It's being added.
[02:48:25.928 --> 02:48:28.230]  And this is the new tyranny.
[02:48:28.270 --> 02:48:32.013]  Men in black masks coming by going, what's wrong with you, crazy person?
[02:48:32.474 --> 02:48:33.194]  Take your shot.
[02:48:33.234 --> 02:48:34.035]  Everyone does.
[02:48:35.456 --> 02:48:41.501]  Meanwhile, the government mails 5,000 plus vials of deadly flu, live flu, for no reason.
[02:48:41.541 --> 02:48:43.663]  They could irradiate it and do the same tests all over the country.
[02:48:45.623 --> 02:48:47.184]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.325 --> 02:48:50.407]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.547 --> 02:48:54.451]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.511 --> 02:48:58.715]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.075 --> 02:49:02.858]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.998 --> 02:49:04.800]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:08.302]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.342 --> 02:49:13.046]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.206 --> 02:49:16.248]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.428 --> 02:49:19.290]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.770 --> 02:49:25.895]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.415 --> 02:49:26.936]  We're good to go.
[02:49:45.097 --> 02:49:49.699]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.

[02:50:41.805 --> 02:50:43.286]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:52:08.768 --> 02:52:09.368]  It's got to be done.
[02:52:10.409 --> 02:52:12.891]  I said I'd take this one final call that's been holding forever.
[02:52:14.172 --> 02:52:16.213]  And Joe, where are you calling us from today?
[02:52:16.233 --> 02:52:17.634]  Toledo, sir.
[02:52:18.215 --> 02:52:19.696]  Welcome to the airwaves, Commander.
[02:52:19.716 --> 02:52:20.896]  Thank you.
[02:52:21.597 --> 02:52:25.640]  I was just curious, Alex, if you have seen Eric Hubschmidt's latest documentary.
[02:52:27.301 --> 02:52:28.342]  What, is it an update of...
[02:52:29.505 --> 02:52:32.787]  No, I just happened to catch it the other day on David Icke's headlines page.
[02:52:33.127 --> 02:52:37.790]  And it's just an interview with a former Marine Colonel's wife.
[02:52:37.890 --> 02:52:38.650]  Well, she's a widower.
[02:52:39.711 --> 02:52:40.811]  And you have to see this.
[02:52:41.052 --> 02:52:46.555]  And she goes through, breaks the whole thing down, talks about all the homosexual black men on the top ranks.
[02:52:47.395 --> 02:52:47.815]  Oh, yeah.
[02:52:47.895 --> 02:52:49.916]  No, I wouldn't call that a documentary.
[02:52:49.957 --> 02:52:50.637]  You mean that interview.
[02:52:51.077 --> 02:52:51.958]  Interview, I guess, yes.
[02:52:52.138 --> 02:52:52.718]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:52:52.798 --> 02:52:53.418]  Oh, okay.
[02:52:54.199 --> 02:52:56.080]  I just thought it was pretty explosive.
[02:52:56.100 --> 02:52:57.741]  I haven't heard you talking about it recently, so...
[02:52:58.721 --> 02:52:59.742]  Well, that's how it works.
[02:52:59.802 --> 02:53:00.462]  That's what they do.
[02:53:02.323 --> 02:53:02.983]  Oh, yeah.
[02:53:03.003 --> 02:53:04.964]  I was just surprised by the names that are named in there.
[02:53:04.984 --> 02:53:10.227]  I usually don't see name-dropping that specific, like with Colonel Gray and Kissinger and the whole pack.
[02:53:10.808 --> 02:53:13.829]  Oh, well, Kissinger, that's been out for a long time.
[02:53:15.030 --> 02:53:24.675]  I mean, we've got mainstream... Look, in my new film, we've got all the mainstream news articles with the male prostitutes, the porn stars bussing them in, huge orgies.
[02:53:25.275 --> 02:53:26.876]  That's your Republican leaders.
[02:53:27.156 --> 02:53:27.997]  They're very Christian.
[02:53:28.570 --> 02:53:28.750]  Right.
[02:53:28.770 --> 02:53:38.358]  Well, I was familiar with Bohemian Grove, of course, with the White House scandal, Franklin cover-up and all that, but I just hadn't seen such a scathing kind of indictment throughout the military.
[02:53:39.078 --> 02:53:40.620]  I need to get that lady on.
[02:53:40.640 --> 02:53:41.340]  Maybe I'll do that.
[02:53:41.841 --> 02:53:42.641]  That'd be great.
[02:53:43.362 --> 02:53:44.002]  I'd love to see that.
[02:53:44.022 --> 02:53:45.023]  So I don't forget that.
[02:53:45.083 --> 02:53:47.685]  Send me that link again to tipsandinfowars.com.
[02:53:48.106 --> 02:53:48.606]  That's a tip?
[02:53:48.626 --> 02:53:51.448]  Okay, I'll send it to the webmaster and keepers a while back.
[02:53:51.689 --> 02:53:52.529]  Okay, we'll send it again.
[02:53:53.070 --> 02:53:53.430]  Take care.
[02:53:53.730 --> 02:53:54.211]  Thanks a lot.
[02:53:54.231 --> 02:53:55.832]  I appreciate you holding to tell me about that.
[02:53:56.637 --> 02:53:59.878]  I'm going to be on with Jack Blood for the next two hours, for people who want to stay with us.
[02:53:59.918 --> 02:54:10.460]  We're going to play clips from my film, clips from Martial Law, coming up in the next hour, so you don't want to miss that.
[02:54:11.580 --> 02:54:17.681]  Before I end this show, I wanted to plug my video here at the end, but I've got to cover this.
[02:54:18.141 --> 02:54:21.262]  Thousands of Chinese villagers protest factory pollution.
[02:54:22.003 --> 02:54:26.986]  I wish we had Americans like this, but thousands of people rioted this week, and this is happening more and more.
[02:54:27.046 --> 02:54:27.726]  People are sick of it.
[02:54:28.086 --> 02:54:32.969]  In the village of southeastern China, overturning police cars and driving away officers.
[02:54:33.169 --> 02:54:36.431]  See, that's what happens when people finally stand up.
[02:54:36.891 --> 02:54:39.473]  Who had tried to stop elderly villagers, that's how it all started.
[02:54:40.094 --> 02:54:41.935]  Beating up old people doesn't go over well in China.
[02:54:41.955 --> 02:54:42.616]  It does here, though.
[02:54:43.156 --> 02:54:45.397]  Protesting against pollution from nearby factories.
[02:54:46.058 --> 02:54:58.886]  By this afternoon, three days after a riot, witnesses say crowds had convened in Huxin Village in Xinjiang Province to gawk at the masses of destroyed police cars and shattered windows.
[02:54:59.306 --> 02:55:07.491]  Police officers outside the village were reportedly blocking reporters from entering the scene, but local people reached by telephones that villagers controlled the riot area.
[02:55:09.184 --> 02:55:09.544]  We're good to go.
[02:55:09.564 --> 02:55:09.704]  I think?
[02:55:32.196 --> 02:55:36.119]  Of Congress who pay their family members to work for them.
[02:55:36.519 --> 02:55:37.380]  Totally criminal.
[02:55:37.900 --> 02:55:41.363]  And the list goes on and on, but I don't have time to cover it at all.
[02:55:43.424 --> 02:55:45.086]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:45.866 --> 02:55:49.389]  My new film, Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[02:55:50.149 --> 02:55:52.211]  We've got anti-Arnold Schwarzenegger t-shirts.
[02:55:52.231 --> 02:55:52.771]  They're beautiful.
[02:55:52.791 --> 02:55:53.412]  You've got to see them.
[02:55:54.622 --> 02:56:09.632]  And we've got the George Orwell t-shirts, so go to InfoWars.com, peruse the Safe Secure Shopping Cart, and get some of the new t-shirts, and the new Phil Marshall lob, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:11.173 --> 02:56:13.795]  Or order all of it via InfoWars.com, as I said.
