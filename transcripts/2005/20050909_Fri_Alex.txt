[00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:06.222]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.883 --> 00:00:07.924]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.645 --> 00:00:09.767]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:11.209]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.891]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.552 --> 00:00:17.216]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.737 --> 00:00:21.822]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:34.027]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Friday, the ninth day of September, 2005, a day that will live in infamy.
[00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:41.051]  We have a detailed report on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:00:41.331 --> 00:00:44.954]  Armed Mexican troops invade the United States.
[00:00:45.014 --> 00:00:46.274]  Now, we know they've kidnapped U.S.
[00:00:46.294 --> 00:00:50.517]  citizens and killed FBI and Border Patrol and Forest Service already.
[00:00:52.262 --> 00:00:54.183]  But this time our government invited them in.
[00:00:54.343 --> 00:01:19.740]  One convoy going to San Antonio with doctors and soup kitchens and other convoys, they admit there are other convoys but won't tell us where they are, have been spotted in places like outside Austin, Texas by multiple witnesses I've personally talked to that I know personally and they were fully armed with fully automatic rifles and handguns.
[00:01:21.892 --> 00:01:23.833]  It's a big, big deal.
[00:01:24.373 --> 00:01:29.336]  And we're going to go over this detailed five-page report that Paul Watson and I wrote last night.
[00:01:32.317 --> 00:01:38.160]  Evacuees are being treated as internees by FEMA all over the country.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.681]  They're not allowed to leave.
[00:01:40.541 --> 00:01:41.942]  Depends on which camp they're at.
[00:01:41.982 --> 00:01:43.243]  It's more severe at others.
[00:01:44.523 --> 00:01:49.766]  And we talked about this three days ago, but I guess it doesn't come home until it's in the New York Times.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.681]  We know they were doing some gun confiscation.
[00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:57.523]  Well, now they've announced that every gun in the city will be taken.
[00:01:57.543 --> 00:02:01.546]  And they're sending in heavily armed SWAT teams viciously.
[00:02:02.226 --> 00:02:03.107]  There are nurses.
[00:02:03.187 --> 00:02:05.768]  There are power plant employees.
[00:02:05.848 --> 00:02:10.631]  There are even people, this is in the mainstream news, who work for the police department.
[00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:12.572]  They live in middle class homes.
[00:02:13.323 --> 00:02:16.525]  In areas that weren't flooded, they have years supply of food, water filters.
[00:02:16.965 --> 00:02:20.206]  They go, why should we leave our homes and go pay at a hotel or go into a shelter?
[00:02:20.586 --> 00:02:23.107]  We have to give up everything we've got to get any aid.
[00:02:25.268 --> 00:02:28.430]  And the police are saying we have licenses to kill.
[00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.191]  We're going to kill you.
[00:02:32.452 --> 00:02:34.613]  We don't have an obligation to protect you.
[00:02:35.013 --> 00:02:37.234]  The police will tell you they have no obligation to protect you.
[00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:38.074]  The courts have said that.
[00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:41.716]  But we've got an obligation to make sure you can't protect yourself.
[00:02:42.293 --> 00:02:44.994]  And now 30% of the city is above water.
[00:02:45.014 --> 00:02:46.535]  20% was never underwater.
[00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:51.438]  And it is the more wealthy areas and middle class areas on the outside of the bowl.
[00:02:52.358 --> 00:02:56.761]  And it's nurses and people that say, hey, I work at a local hospital.
[00:02:56.781 --> 00:02:57.521]  We're still open.
[00:02:58.001 --> 00:02:59.282]  Am I supposed to leave my job?
[00:02:59.302 --> 00:03:00.342]  Where am I supposed to sleep?
[00:03:01.163 --> 00:03:03.204]  And the police just say, it doesn't matter.
[00:03:04.545 --> 00:03:05.205]  Doesn't matter.
[00:03:06.606 --> 00:03:08.146]  Not going to be anybody at that hospital.
[00:03:08.166 --> 00:03:11.168]  Doesn't matter if the hospital is open and running and above water.
[00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:19.406]  They're just saying, we're coming, and it's in the newspapers, we got license to kill, we're the government, and we're going to kill you!
[00:03:19.426 --> 00:03:30.830]  That'll intimidate most people, most people will leave, but some aren't going to leave, and you know, they're going to go into old vets' houses, old men are going to just, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, they're going to kill American patriots.
[00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:40.773]  Just like 1775 at Lexington and Concord, when the Redcoats came a-marching to confiscate the guns, confiscate the rifles, the shot and the powder.
[00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:50.973]  And I look at the video on TV and the photos of these goons, these soft, evil goons in their black masks and their little outfits.
[00:03:51.753 --> 00:03:52.573]  Scum of the earth.
[00:03:52.614 --> 00:03:56.195]  And they say, no more aid now for four days to anybody in the city.
[00:03:56.495 --> 00:03:57.815]  No more food, no more water.
[00:03:57.855 --> 00:04:00.116]  You've got to leave and let FEMA have it.
[00:04:00.136 --> 00:04:06.718]  We're going to bulldoze most of the city and we're going to build hotels and an international Singapore-style port in its place.
[00:04:07.098 --> 00:04:08.739]  And we're going to take what you got
[00:04:09.648 --> 00:04:15.072]  And if you want any government aid, you gotta give your cars and money up, you gotta show up at a Superdome or at a camp.
[00:04:16.113 --> 00:04:17.574]  We just might take your children.
[00:04:19.036 --> 00:04:25.381]  And a lot of them in these news articles are saying, well, I'm a... I'm a firefighter, I'm still on the force here.
[00:04:26.021 --> 00:04:28.103]  Or I'm a nurse, or I work at the power plant.
[00:04:28.643 --> 00:04:29.284]  I can't leave.
[00:04:29.744 --> 00:04:31.326]  I'm a janitor at the police department.
[00:04:33.047 --> 00:04:35.189]  And the cops come to the janitor's house, they even know him.
[00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.350]  Well, I can't leave.
[00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:37.851]  Where are you staying?
[00:04:37.891 --> 00:04:39.172]  Just get out or we're gonna kill you.
[00:04:41.115 --> 00:04:42.997]  Now give us your guns right now, Bill.
[00:04:43.638 --> 00:04:44.298]  Give them to us!
[00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:45.720]  Listen, we're scared too.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.660]  We're going to follow orders.
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.002]  We're going to be on top of this.
[00:04:49.423 --> 00:04:51.545]  Doesn't matter if my family will be sold out next week.
[00:04:51.585 --> 00:04:55.929]  Right now I'm ready to kill you for your guns for a government that doesn't give a damn about me.
[00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:05.203]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.464 --> 00:05:07.045]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.385 --> 00:05:12.069]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:19.135]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.455 --> 00:05:21.457]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:24.499]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.579 --> 00:05:29.262]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.463 --> 00:05:33.866]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.086 --> 00:05:41.311]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.572 --> 00:05:43.993]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:03.061 --> 00:06:04.102]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.422 --> 00:06:07.224]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.484 --> 00:06:11.627]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.068 --> 00:06:12.888]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:17.772]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.252 --> 00:06:20.393]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.873 --> 00:06:21.773]  Sheltering in Place!
[00:06:22.173 --> 00:06:35.576]  Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.616 --> 00:06:42.658]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:06:49.901 --> 00:06:51.422]  Or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[00:07:01.635 --> 00:07:08.140]  I love the new sandal style, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.363]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[00:07:12.644 --> 00:07:14.805]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[00:07:15.146 --> 00:07:22.191]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[00:07:22.491 --> 00:07:25.113]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[00:07:25.373 --> 00:07:28.856]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[00:07:29.136 --> 00:07:37.043]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:07:37.404 --> 00:07:38.925]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:07:39.185 --> 00:07:45.011]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid.
[00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:53.899]  Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:59.845]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:08:01.506 --> 00:08:07.051]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.522 --> 00:08:34.173]  Alright, we have multiple, multiple, multiple credible witnesses of armed Mexican troops in and around Austin yesterday with their German assault rifles.
[00:08:38.058 --> 00:08:46.585]  We have the AP admitting there are multiple convoys in the state, not just the food convoy with the doctors and the nurses in the soup kitchen.
[00:08:47.105 --> 00:08:56.092]  Then you look at the photos, it's troops that went to San Antonio and are at Old Kelly, or what is now known at the airbase as Kelly, USA.
[00:08:57.393 --> 00:08:58.214]  Unprecedented.
[00:08:58.274 --> 00:09:00.356]  Ron Paul's office, we got a statement yesterday.
[00:09:01.356 --> 00:09:05.800]  Mexican troops here, period, is illegal and unconstitutional.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.281]  But they are armed.
[00:09:08.075 --> 00:09:21.927]  We're all being conditioned three years ago, two and a half years ago, our government signed an agreement to use Mexican troops, quote, to patrol America during natural disasters or to fight terrorists.
[00:09:22.848 --> 00:09:26.111]  Now that's in the agreement and it's in my film, The Road to Tyranny, of all places.
[00:09:26.972 --> 00:09:31.235]  The different news articles and reports even before they signed the agreement.
[00:09:32.536 --> 00:09:34.118]  Came out with that film three and a half years ago.
[00:09:35.225 --> 00:09:39.332]  And they signed the agreement, I guess, about two and a half years ago, and it was a big deal in Canada.
[00:09:39.352 --> 00:09:41.636]  They called it a loss of sovereignty to Canada.
[00:09:42.658 --> 00:09:47.727]  But here, obviously, most Americans don't even know how to read a newspaper, so why does it even matter?
[00:09:48.286 --> 00:09:52.308]  I mean, we're in a lot of trouble, folks, and we've got a detailed report on that.
[00:09:52.989 --> 00:10:07.677]  Also, a lot of credible reports in mainstream news, ABC News, the Globe and Mail up in Canada with police and others saying that they saw and heard explosions going off at seven of the dikes simultaneously.
[00:10:08.177 --> 00:10:16.282]  Then the media, of course, predominantly focuses on some gang member type who can't string a sentence together saying it as a witness and, oh, they're just a kook.
[00:10:18.787 --> 00:10:24.010]  And watching this whole thing unfold in New Orleans, it is totally clear.
[00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:39.737]  This is a giant war game, a giant drill, a giant laboratory to train the public to accept martial law, gun confiscations, breakup of families, checkpoints, no due process, shoot to kill orders.
[00:10:42.652 --> 00:10:52.102]  And simultaneously, it'll be a huge economic boon to certain financial interests that are openly getting all of the select contracts.
[00:10:53.163 --> 00:10:56.006]  And it's a big political diversion from the Iraq War.
[00:10:56.847 --> 00:11:02.493]  The disgust with that was building towards a head nationally with Bush's approval rating in the low 30s.
[00:11:04.298 --> 00:11:08.241]  And now people are distracted and diverted off of that whole globalist agenda.
[00:11:08.601 --> 00:11:10.522]  Again, Bush can be hung out to dry later.
[00:11:10.803 --> 00:11:11.763]  He's just a puppet.
[00:11:12.003 --> 00:11:13.845]  He absorbs all the attacks.
[00:11:14.145 --> 00:11:17.967]  Meanwhile, the globalists will just stick a Democrat in later who will continue the agenda.
[00:11:18.368 --> 00:11:18.968]  It doesn't matter.
[00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:28.955]  And yes, we have what we reported on three days ago, and I got smirking neocon emails, Alex, you're full of it.
[00:11:29.545 --> 00:11:31.726]  They're not confiscating guns.
[00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:40.012]  When I posted mainstream news articles out of New Orleans, out of Louisiana, George Bush wouldn't allow that.
[00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:46.496]  Well, I'm sure now that it's in your face on the national TV, you'll go, well, it's needed, I guess.
[00:11:46.676 --> 00:11:51.019]  I mean, it's sad to say, but there's been a problem out there.
[00:11:51.599 --> 00:11:53.000]  You people make me sick.
[00:11:54.207 --> 00:12:07.256]  And they've got all these little neocon, you know, they think they're conservative, BATF people and state police out there, running around all over New Orleans, and they're saying, we got license to kill!
[00:12:07.877 --> 00:12:13.441]  Backed up by the Army and the Marines, and we're going door to door, and we're going to take your guns!
[00:12:14.562 --> 00:12:18.084]  Funny, all those drills I went to, they trained to take our guns.
[00:12:18.925 --> 00:12:20.386]  I went all over the country.
[00:12:21.425 --> 00:12:25.708]  In the South, in the North, in Texas, in California.
[00:12:26.348 --> 00:12:28.369]  I've been all over the country.
[00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.371]  Right here in Central Texas.
[00:12:30.911 --> 00:12:49.783]  I witness the regular Army with the National Guard and the State Guard and the local police and they practice setting up checkpoints and pulling you out of your cars and breaking your families up and loading you on Army trucks and taking your guns and they practice taking over your city halls and they practice taking over the gun shops.
[00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:54.133]  And they practice, they call us rebels.
[00:12:55.494 --> 00:12:58.598]  And I'd be at these drills and watch them calling us rebels.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.385]  And then I'd watch the national news and they'd say, oh, the troops were training for Macedonia.
[00:13:05.926 --> 00:13:07.608]  They were training for Iraq.
[00:13:08.028 --> 00:13:09.470]  And I guess it is dual training.
[00:13:09.490 --> 00:13:10.912]  They're going to take their guns there as well.
[00:13:12.228 --> 00:13:14.829]  And our journey towards enslavement can be complete.
[00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:20.571]  So now the New York Times headline, all guns, even lawfully owned, are being confiscated.
[00:13:20.591 --> 00:13:21.712]  And they're not tagging them.
[00:13:21.952 --> 00:13:22.992]  They're not getting them back.
[00:13:23.032 --> 00:13:25.574]  They're going to smelt them, like all over the country.
[00:13:25.594 --> 00:13:28.715]  And they're going to make anti-gun statues in front of the city halls.
[00:13:29.215 --> 00:13:30.095]  It's their religion.
[00:13:30.155 --> 00:13:33.357]  It's like in front of the UN, that 357 Magnum.
[00:13:33.677 --> 00:13:38.339]  That big old statue made out of melted down guns.
[00:13:39.019 --> 00:13:41.120]  All those thousands of gun buybacks.
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.762]  We'll give you $200 for your gun.
[00:13:43.802 --> 00:13:48.805]  And the old ladies line up with beautifully engraved $5,000 shotguns.
[00:13:48.845 --> 00:13:51.647]  Their old husband died, old World War II vet.
[00:13:51.927 --> 00:13:52.567]  She didn't know.
[00:13:52.627 --> 00:13:54.829]  She just knew her guns were evil and dangerous.
[00:13:55.189 --> 00:14:00.433]  And she takes in all those prized guns and the cops openly lick their lips and go sell them out the back door.
[00:14:00.473 --> 00:14:02.334]  But all the others get melted down.
[00:14:03.075 --> 00:14:08.280]  And then everybody sees it on the news, the image of cops and people lined up handing their guns in.
[00:14:08.621 --> 00:14:13.826]  Meanwhile in Australia they registered the guns and now they started banning them and people are lined up handing them in.
[00:14:14.146 --> 00:14:16.228]  First they register them in England, then they ban them.
[00:14:16.268 --> 00:14:17.790]  Everybody goes and hands them in.
[00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:19.191]  I got the video in Australia.
[00:14:19.371 --> 00:14:20.973]  They register them, then they ban them.
[00:14:21.153 --> 00:14:22.715]  Then everybody goes and hands them in.
[00:14:24.708 --> 00:14:27.509]  And now the whole country's getting deceived.
[00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:29.570]  Military and police, door to door.
[00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:31.730]  Every gun will be turned in.
[00:14:32.030 --> 00:14:35.852]  We have license to kill you if you don't follow orders.
[00:14:38.513 --> 00:14:40.533]  A few handful of people riot and loot.
[00:14:40.573 --> 00:14:42.314]  The citizens of the state behind me were armed.
[00:14:42.734 --> 00:14:43.514]  Stop the looting.
[00:14:43.534 --> 00:14:44.835]  That's in a whole bunch of newspapers.
[00:14:44.895 --> 00:14:45.375]  It's admitted.
[00:14:46.405 --> 00:14:49.866]  The cops all just basically sit back as FEMA's jamming their communications.
[00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:51.307]  Cutting communications lines.
[00:14:51.347 --> 00:14:53.128]  FEMA won't let food and water in for five days.
[00:14:53.448 --> 00:14:54.268]  Stuff breaks down.
[00:14:54.288 --> 00:14:55.288]  There's a few problems.
[00:14:55.749 --> 00:14:56.409]  A few looters.
[00:14:56.449 --> 00:14:58.330]  A few drug addicts breaking in drug stores.
[00:14:59.350 --> 00:15:01.631]  And they go, oh my gosh, it's total bedlam.
[00:15:01.951 --> 00:15:03.492]  Well, we better have martial law.
[00:15:03.532 --> 00:15:04.212]  That's right.
[00:15:04.252 --> 00:15:06.833]  Now the good old boys are swagging around.
[00:15:07.893 --> 00:15:09.614]  Guaranteed we'll hear them on talk radio.
[00:15:09.974 --> 00:15:11.194]  I haven't yet, but guaranteed.
[00:15:11.214 --> 00:15:13.055]  I haven't had a chance to listen last night or this morning.
[00:15:13.355 --> 00:15:15.136]  Guaranteed they're going to be calling in going, well,
[00:15:16.025 --> 00:15:18.166]  I just guess we've got to turn our guns in.
[00:15:18.766 --> 00:15:22.328]  By the way, if you're doubting me, this is from three weeks ago.
[00:15:22.468 --> 00:15:23.508]  Roanoke, Virginia.
[00:15:25.029 --> 00:15:34.572]  FEMA, drill, regular military, state guard, national guard, state police, local police, firefighters, and the role players.
[00:15:34.592 --> 00:15:36.173]  You've got to go to the website and see the video.
[00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:40.855]  The cops practice shooting American citizens, and they call us rebels.
[00:15:41.744 --> 00:15:43.205]  Now, see, I saw this in 98.
[00:15:43.305 --> 00:15:44.326]  I saw this in 99.
[00:15:44.546 --> 00:15:46.388]  But they never put it on the news.
[00:15:46.748 --> 00:15:51.832]  But suddenly, all over the country, building up to what happened in New Orleans, they were announcing it.
[00:15:51.932 --> 00:15:53.854]  Yes, we're gonna kill the rebels.
[00:15:54.474 --> 00:15:55.815]  There's gonna be rebels.
[00:15:55.835 --> 00:16:01.280]  See, because they gotta legitimize it and put it out in the open, so all these well-meaning people go along with it.
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:04.142]  Go ahead and roll that piece out of Roanoke, Virginia.
[00:16:05.143 --> 00:16:10.707]  Covering your hometown, from newsrooms across the region, this is News 7 at 11.
[00:16:13.502 --> 00:16:20.008]  The scenario was a fake, but the pepper spray and billy clubs used to break up this riot were definitely real.
[00:16:21.129 --> 00:16:22.570]  Good evening, I'm Miranda Stevens.
[00:16:22.590 --> 00:16:28.836]  Whether it's terrorism, riots, or any major disaster, local agencies will be the first to respond.
[00:16:29.196 --> 00:16:33.800]  That's why Roanoke City wants its disaster training to be as real as possible.
[00:16:34.221 --> 00:16:35.482]  Jeremy Butterfield has more.
[00:16:38.872 --> 00:16:45.236]  It's supposed to look like a riot, and the scene at William Fleming High School had all the elements.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:50.925]  One of the rioters, the guard, and the police force had to take down an arrest and bid very successfully.
[00:16:52.267 --> 00:16:54.889]  In this scenario, everyone has a role to play.
[00:16:55.210 --> 00:17:06.081]  The rioters were ready to fight back as Roanoke Police, Roanoke Fire, local National Guard troops, and members of the Virginia Defense Force secured perimeters and moved in to make the arrest.
[00:17:08.482 --> 00:17:13.169]  Prior to 9-11, these organizations couldn't communicate and did not work together.
[00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:15.994]  They worked to support each other, but not together.
[00:17:16.574 --> 00:17:22.524]  And with the recent events of the last three to five years, we've become very good at working together.
[00:17:24.957 --> 00:17:26.838]  Of course, these weren't real rioters.
[00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:33.704]  The rebels in t-shirts were all members of one of the participating agencies, but you couldn't tell that during the exercise.
[00:17:34.084 --> 00:17:45.272]  If you weren't protected by an orange vest signifying you as an observer, you were in danger of being hit by eggs, bottles, billy clubs, or even the occasional well-placed round from a sniper.
[00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:49.015]  We try to make this very real, give a real feel to it.
[00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:50.837]  The fire department provided some
[00:17:51.505 --> 00:17:56.890]  Some live burning out here, so we had smoke, flames, objects being thrown, a lot of chaos.
[00:17:56.910 --> 00:18:01.994]  There's going to be a lot of chaos in a civil disturbance situation, and that's what we want to try to incorporate as much as possible.
[00:18:02.915 --> 00:18:04.557]  Teamwork plays a major role.
[00:18:04.837 --> 00:18:11.523]  Mountain Police had to coordinate with the Fire Department, while National Guard troops marched in formation toward the rioters.
[00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:17.008]  Without cooperation throughout all the agencies, the rioters would have quickly taken control.
[00:18:17.848 --> 00:18:19.289]  I think everybody learned a little bit.
[00:18:19.850 --> 00:18:23.893]  Mistakes are made, but we'd rather make those mistakes here than in a real situation.
[00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:34.721]  This was the fourth year the agencies have participated in this drill, and organizers say the old adage, practice makes perfect, certainly holds true in the face of disaster.
[00:18:35.241 --> 00:18:37.463]  Jeremy Butterfield, News 7, Roanoke.
[00:18:38.584 --> 00:18:41.646]  I noticed they mixed terror and disaster all together.
[00:18:41.666 --> 00:18:44.128]  And people are going, yeah, look at the disaster, it's good.
[00:18:45.194 --> 00:18:49.795]  They stand down, the crisis is created, then it burns itself out.
[00:18:50.116 --> 00:18:51.176]  It runs its own course.
[00:18:51.616 --> 00:18:53.917]  The statisticians and social engineers know this.
[00:18:55.397 --> 00:19:01.219]  It burns out and they just march in and then get to squeeze and take property and take everybody's guns.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:04.540]  So they've got all this worked out.
[00:19:05.801 --> 00:19:07.121]  And look at who they're going to take guns from.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:09.721]  Look, firefighters.
[00:19:10.402 --> 00:19:11.163]  It's in the newspaper.
[00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:12.144]  I mean, they admit it.
[00:19:12.164 --> 00:19:13.165]  They've got the cops bragging.
[00:19:13.445 --> 00:19:24.178]  The firefighters, nurses, power plant employees, superintendents, people who have stayed behind, who are actually, I mean, they're going, hey, I'm even with the government.
[00:19:24.258 --> 00:19:25.179]  I've got to work here.
[00:19:25.199 --> 00:19:26.020]  This is my house.
[00:19:27.603 --> 00:19:30.626]  Just come out, lay the guns on the ground, hands up.
[00:19:30.786 --> 00:19:31.527]  We got a job.
[00:19:31.687 --> 00:19:32.768]  We're the guys with the guns.
[00:19:32.808 --> 00:19:33.309]  Don't worry.
[00:19:33.469 --> 00:19:34.970]  They ain't gonna take my gun.
[00:19:35.751 --> 00:19:36.792]  I'm gonna take yours.
[00:19:37.353 --> 00:19:38.714]  I'm gonna take yours, buddy.
[00:19:41.677 --> 00:19:42.798]  I like George Bush.
[00:19:43.817 --> 00:19:46.260]  And I'm conservative and I listen to country music.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:47.722]  That must make me conservative.
[00:19:48.162 --> 00:19:51.106]  Hell, I broke borders though, because I'm a piece of trash.
[00:19:53.409 --> 00:19:54.690]  You pieces of filth.
[00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:56.833]  You traitorous scum.
[00:19:56.973 --> 00:19:58.295]  I hate your guts.
[00:20:01.553 --> 00:20:02.533]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:20:02.614 --> 00:20:07.396]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:20:07.556 --> 00:20:15.359]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:20:15.619 --> 00:20:21.002]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:20:21.202 --> 00:20:28.185]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:20:28.485 --> 00:20:33.832]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:20:34.092 --> 00:20:38.819]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:20:39.159 --> 00:20:46.749]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:20:47.089 --> 00:20:53.332]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:20:53.632 --> 00:20:54.792]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.812 --> 00:20:55.073]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:00.979 --> 00:21:02.560]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.683]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:21:08.943 --> 00:21:14.066]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:21:14.426 --> 00:21:23.691]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:29.013]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:21:29.334 --> 00:21:33.336]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:21:33.536 --> 00:21:38.258]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:21:38.678 --> 00:21:44.561]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:22:01.848 --> 00:22:04.369]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:10.232]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[00:22:11.144 --> 00:22:18.029]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[00:22:19.070 --> 00:22:27.676]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[00:22:28.777 --> 00:22:36.723]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:38.218 --> 00:22:40.360]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:40.640]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:40.960]  Call now.

[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:05.364]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:23:05.484 --> 00:23:07.245]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:23:07.305 --> 00:23:08.566]  But not just any water.
[00:23:08.646 --> 00:23:12.870]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:22.639]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:23:22.939 --> 00:23:28.546]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[00:23:28.726 --> 00:23:33.331]  Use topically to treat acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burned skin, rashes, and more.
[00:23:33.511 --> 00:23:37.436]  Use eo-orally to treat sore throat, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.
[00:23:37.776 --> 00:23:41.637]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show!
[00:24:07.731 --> 00:24:10.133]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:11.674 --> 00:24:23.002]  I got George Galloway to talk about 9-11 and the government and the Iraq War and the outspoken member of British Parliament coming on in the 30 minutes of the next hour.
[00:24:23.022 --> 00:24:24.944]  We'll continue with news and your calls.
[00:24:26.005 --> 00:24:30.528]  In the first 30 minutes of the third hour, I have Larry Pratt coming on, gun owners of America.
[00:24:31.638 --> 00:24:38.800]  We'll talk about Bush, as mentioned, Gonzalez, that's who he's probably going to push, who openly says that he wants more than just the assault of his band.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:44.262]  He believes in massive gun control and abortion, and we're now liberal because we're against it.
[00:24:44.362 --> 00:24:45.782]  You people, again, you are sick.
[00:24:46.122 --> 00:24:46.743]  You are sick.
[00:24:47.203 --> 00:24:49.844]  You Bush followers are sick, sick people.
[00:24:50.604 --> 00:24:51.364]  You are sick!
[00:24:52.444 --> 00:24:53.945]  You have destroyed this country!
[00:24:55.945 --> 00:25:00.627]  You can't see an enemy when they're dressed up in our uniform, when they're sabotaging our country,
[00:25:01.337 --> 00:25:07.380]  You're so fooled by a wolf that's pulled a sheep's outfit over it when its teeth are sticking out and you can see its yellow eyes?
[00:25:08.961 --> 00:25:09.341]  Idiots!
[00:25:10.602 --> 00:25:15.924]  Charles, Ron, Stavos, David, Patrick, we'll get to you before Galloway comes on.
[00:25:18.703 --> 00:25:20.584]  That's when you think you can't get outraged anymore.
[00:25:20.624 --> 00:25:24.266]  You know, Tommy Thompson comes out and says, I've got a microchip, every child needs one.
[00:25:24.527 --> 00:25:27.408]  He's traveling the country to middle schools telling kids to get chips.
[00:25:27.809 --> 00:25:29.270]  I mean, that's Twilight Zone right there.
[00:25:29.650 --> 00:25:31.311]  Member, you know, former member of the cabinet.
[00:25:32.231 --> 00:25:38.715]  Uh, you know, you got the government passing new freedom for forced psychological testing, forced drugging of children in America they're now trying to implement.
[00:25:38.895 --> 00:25:40.617]  They pass a national ID card.
[00:25:41.677 --> 00:25:43.518]  They're pushing for total blanket amnesty.
[00:25:43.558 --> 00:25:44.459]  They pass CAFTA.
[00:25:47.034 --> 00:25:47.895]  The evidence is clear.
[00:25:47.915 --> 00:25:56.501]  They blew the levees, then they cut the police power, they cut the police communications, they blocked the food and water, they had things break down, they blocked the firefighters.
[00:25:57.902 --> 00:26:10.552]  They let all those people die, and now they got a bunch of degenerate scum and a bunch of other cops being trained how to gun confiscate a giant, giant laboratory drill that'll be used as the model all over the rest of the country.
[00:26:11.473 --> 00:26:13.334]  Meanwhile, we've confirmed it.
[00:26:13.354 --> 00:26:15.056]  There are multiple Mexican convoys
[00:26:15.726 --> 00:26:20.248]  And we know at least one of them is armed, driving around with HPs and Heckler & Kochs.
[00:26:21.288 --> 00:26:24.590]  I just can't... I'm living in a Twilight Zone episode.
[00:26:25.490 --> 00:26:34.093]  And all these drooling, weak, soft government followers... These aren't men, these are just little cowards, little toadies.
[00:26:35.074 --> 00:26:38.275]  I mean, most of them aren't even evil, they're just so stupid!
[00:26:39.535 --> 00:26:40.516]  Ignoramuses!
[00:26:42.472 --> 00:26:51.094]  I mean, I've got reports here where cops go to people's houses they know, and even work in key infrastructure in the city, and they're like, I'm working in the relief effort, this is my house!
[00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:54.755]  Bill, come out or we're gonna have to kill you!
[00:26:55.255 --> 00:26:55.915]  I'm sorry!
[00:26:56.295 --> 00:26:57.815]  What is wrong with you police?
[00:26:57.855 --> 00:27:00.516]  Would you follow an order to slit your mother's throat?
[00:27:00.796 --> 00:27:01.576]  You idiots!
[00:27:02.496 --> 00:27:06.657]  I mean, the best example is the emergency manager for the parish that New Orleans is in.
[00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.211]  His mother for five days is stuck.
[00:27:09.491 --> 00:27:12.452]  He's got helicopters to save her and the people at the nursing home.
[00:27:13.672 --> 00:27:16.513]  And he actually sat there and let his mama die.
[00:27:18.014 --> 00:27:19.495]  Because FEMA told him not to get her.
[00:27:20.155 --> 00:27:23.656]  I mean, you people are scum!
[00:27:24.116 --> 00:27:25.277]  You are scum!
[00:27:25.517 --> 00:27:27.237]  You aren't even human beings!
[00:27:27.758 --> 00:27:29.678]  A rat will protect its babies.
[00:27:30.979 --> 00:27:33.580]  A monkey, a chimpanzee will protect its mother.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:34.160]  Did you know that?
[00:27:36.647 --> 00:27:38.549]  Chimpanzees are afraid of hyenas, folks.
[00:27:38.809 --> 00:27:44.035]  But if a hyena grabs one of the mothers, and I've seen the documentaries, they will jump out of the tree and fight.
[00:27:45.336 --> 00:27:46.317]  Even if it means they die.
[00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:49.160]  He won't even protect your young.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.402]  You are scum!
[00:27:50.882 --> 00:27:52.023]  You are... I just want to say it.
[00:27:52.223 --> 00:27:52.624]  Scum!
[00:27:52.704 --> 00:27:53.064]  Scum!
[00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:53.865]  Total scum!
[00:27:54.025 --> 00:27:54.866]  Filthy scum!
[00:27:54.906 --> 00:27:56.047]  You are going to go to hell!
[00:27:56.228 --> 00:27:57.049]  God hates you!
[00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:59.031]  You are cursed!
[00:27:59.682 --> 00:28:01.824]  You are just disgraceful trash!
[00:28:02.084 --> 00:28:08.769]  I love this country and you are the scum, trash, worms, just, I just don't even, I can't even talk!
[00:28:09.089 --> 00:28:10.450]  You people are filth!
[00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:13.492]  You people are just total scum!
[00:28:15.974 --> 00:28:17.575]  It's gonna happen nationwide, you watch.
[00:28:17.595 --> 00:28:20.437]  They're gonna nuke, they're gonna release bios, it's all gonna happen.
[00:28:20.457 --> 00:28:21.658]  This is the setup for it.
[00:28:22.399 --> 00:28:26.882]  They're gonna do it and the scum's gonna rule over us and we're gonna be a filthy cesspit.
[00:28:27.629 --> 00:28:29.110]  All our freedoms, everything are gone.
[00:28:29.130 --> 00:28:30.250]  We're all gonna be slaves.
[00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.291]  I hope you enjoy it.
[00:28:33.252 --> 00:28:38.854]  I hope whoever came in my office last night and left this in my chair is really proud of themselves, too.
[00:28:39.095 --> 00:28:40.315]  I'm redoubling my efforts.
[00:28:40.895 --> 00:28:41.956]  You guys can kill me.
[00:28:41.976 --> 00:28:42.596]  I don't care.
[00:28:42.656 --> 00:28:44.257]  I'm gonna expose you to the end.
[00:28:51.861 --> 00:28:52.781]  I am just sick of it.
[00:28:55.157 --> 00:28:55.337]  I am.
[00:28:55.558 --> 00:28:57.119]  This is 1776, folks.
[00:28:57.159 --> 00:28:59.641]  This is... This is disgusting.
[00:28:59.701 --> 00:29:00.622]  I want to take your calls.
[00:29:00.662 --> 00:29:01.683]  I got to control myself.
[00:29:01.763 --> 00:29:02.884]  I just... You know what?
[00:29:02.904 --> 00:29:05.646]  If we don't get mad about this, then we won't get mad about anything.
[00:29:07.528 --> 00:29:08.229]  God help us.
[00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:11.291]  Why am I upset about this?
[00:29:11.331 --> 00:29:13.173]  We've killed almost 50 million babies.
[00:29:13.553 --> 00:29:14.974]  This, I guess, is nothing compared to that.
[00:29:18.237 --> 00:29:20.039]  We're just an evil, pathetic country.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:25.181]  Alright, when we get back, I'm gonna control myself.
[00:29:25.201 --> 00:29:27.863]  I'm gonna cover the Mexican troops running around with weapons in Texas.
[00:29:29.324 --> 00:29:30.184]  Oh, why should I care?
[00:29:30.204 --> 00:29:31.925]  The Austin police think it's funny when we call them.
[00:29:32.065 --> 00:29:32.706]  Yeah, so what?
[00:29:33.906 --> 00:29:34.987]  Did they threaten you with the guns?
[00:29:35.007 --> 00:29:35.707]  Well, then so what?
[00:29:37.148 --> 00:29:41.151]  And, uh... And I'll get into the gun confiscation.
[00:29:41.191 --> 00:29:46.194]  I mean, it's just... They're talking about gun confiscation in three states right now, not just New Orleans.
[00:29:47.534 --> 00:29:49.035]  Yeah, that's what you need to be doing.
[00:29:49.055 --> 00:29:49.776]  That'll keep us safe.
[00:29:51.701 --> 00:29:54.703]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.624 --> 00:29:58.306]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.483 --> 00:31:07.728]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.868 --> 00:31:14.034]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.314 --> 00:31:22.681]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.

[00:32:03.411 --> 00:32:10.253]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:32:10.513 --> 00:32:12.874]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:32:13.134 --> 00:32:15.114]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:32:15.434 --> 00:32:20.796]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:32:21.176 --> 00:32:21.296]  Yes!
[00:32:21.316 --> 00:32:25.461]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.

[00:32:34.011 --> 00:32:39.057]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[00:32:39.077 --> 00:32:41.100]  military and numerous other government agencies.

[00:32:56.684 --> 00:32:57.184]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:33:23.554 --> 00:33:29.558]  I'm just so angry at the people that are destroying this country.
[00:33:29.578 --> 00:33:37.764]  I mean, we know the globalists are cold-blooded controllers who know what they're doing and play us like a fiddle, but how all of you go along with it?
[00:33:39.305 --> 00:33:40.847]  I mean, you can't bring food and water to people.
[00:33:42.768 --> 00:33:46.511]  So you're now laying siege to the entire city.
[00:33:46.751 --> 00:33:48.873]  You don't let people even walk out of the city.
[00:33:48.893 --> 00:33:50.554]  They've shot a lot of people to try to walk out.
[00:33:52.702 --> 00:34:00.104]  You use maybe five or ten examples of people shooting at each other and you build it up and hype it up this big thing and now all that's gone.
[00:34:00.124 --> 00:34:01.524]  The city's been totally subdued.
[00:34:01.884 --> 00:34:03.084]  People always burn out.
[00:34:04.425 --> 00:34:09.246]  The drug addicts are all laid up in attics with the drugs they stole out of pharmacies.
[00:34:09.686 --> 00:34:19.248]  The cops march in and start going to the nurses' houses and the superintendents' houses and
[00:34:19.995 --> 00:34:24.658]  And the janitor's houses, and the little people, and going, give us your goods!
[00:34:25.099 --> 00:34:27.160]  We've been waiting a long time for this!
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:27.861]  Now give them!
[00:34:28.201 --> 00:34:28.741]  Give them!
[00:34:28.841 --> 00:34:29.362]  Give them!
[00:34:30.142 --> 00:34:30.642]  Give them!
[00:34:31.563 --> 00:34:32.864]  Only we get to have them!
[00:34:33.905 --> 00:34:34.485]  Makes me sick.
[00:34:34.525 --> 00:34:43.251]  I mean, literally, I was watching them on news, just these white trash cops, and these big fat cops strutting around in their Nazi outfits.
[00:34:44.072 --> 00:34:45.773]  Their little mustaches make me sick.
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:49.682]  I don't have words to describe how disgusting you are.
[00:34:49.982 --> 00:34:51.183]  You are the scum of the earth.
[00:34:51.543 --> 00:34:53.104]  You make the species look shameful.
[00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:54.365]  You make America look shameful.
[00:34:54.385 --> 00:34:55.846]  You make police look shameful.
[00:34:57.007 --> 00:34:57.767]  You're trash.
[00:34:58.488 --> 00:34:59.608]  Alright, I'm going to control myself.
[00:34:59.708 --> 00:35:02.210]  I just gun confiscate and trash.
[00:35:04.731 --> 00:35:05.572]  I'm just seething.
[00:35:05.732 --> 00:35:07.493]  I just cannot allow myself to be this angry.
[00:35:07.513 --> 00:35:11.696]  I've got to fight these people because I love my family, not because I hate them.
[00:35:11.896 --> 00:35:13.437]  Hate will burn you out, folks.
[00:35:13.877 --> 00:35:14.738]  Let's not be hateful.
[00:35:16.687 --> 00:35:18.468]  Oh boy, I tell ya.
[00:35:18.488 --> 00:35:20.890]  I don't even feel like doing this show today.
[00:35:20.930 --> 00:35:21.971]  I'm so mad, folks.
[00:35:23.032 --> 00:35:30.257]  I am just at the... Mass gun confiscation from law-abiding citizens begins.
[00:35:30.337 --> 00:35:32.739]  First time this has happened since Reconstruction.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:41.245]  Federal forces lead criminal gangs of police in America killing gun grab.
[00:35:44.065 --> 00:35:46.286]  The balloon has gone up, the shoe has dropped.
[00:35:46.346 --> 00:35:58.450]  Anyone doubting the criminal intentions of the social engineer control freaks in Washington need only look at the middle class neighborhoods being stormed by black mask wearing jackboots.
[00:35:59.691 --> 00:36:02.151]  By black mask wearing jackbooted thugs.
[00:36:02.191 --> 00:36:03.472]  I forgot to put thugs there.
[00:36:04.452 --> 00:36:06.713]  Email Slick Heisen and ask him to add thugs there.
[00:36:06.753 --> 00:36:08.514]  I broke this in like five minutes.
[00:36:08.534 --> 00:36:09.634]  I don't have time for anything.
[00:36:10.174 --> 00:36:11.615]  On a mission to steal guns.
[00:36:11.655 --> 00:36:12.275]  Let me start over.
[00:36:13.436 --> 00:36:29.544]  The balloon has gone up, the shoe has dropped, anyone doubting the criminal intentions of the social engineer control freeze in Washington can only look at the middle-class neighborhoods being stormed by black masks wearing jackboots on a mission to steal guns.
[00:36:30.984 --> 00:36:33.986]  This is a precedent-setting case for national gun confiscation.
[00:36:34.426 --> 00:36:39.809]  This is a clear declaration of war by the federal government against the American people.
[00:36:40.149 --> 00:36:42.690]  Headlines on CNN, everywhere, it just reads,
[00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:47.441]  Law-abiding citizens have guns confiscated.
[00:36:47.461 --> 00:36:48.321]  They want you to know that.
[00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:49.261]  They're getting used to it.
[00:36:49.622 --> 00:36:51.262]  Never before, so now you're hearing it.
[00:36:51.563 --> 00:36:53.764]  It'll be so much easier the next time and the next time.
[00:36:54.364 --> 00:36:59.406]  This is exactly how Lexington and Concord started the Revolutionary War in 1775.
[00:37:04.238 --> 00:37:18.148]  The federal government has been chomping at the bit for decades to disarm the American people, and now an amalgamation of state and local police, led by the BATF, are having their deepest desires fulfilled in New Orleans.
[00:37:18.969 --> 00:37:20.590]  You sick trash.
[00:37:23.312 --> 00:37:23.933]  I'm sorry.
[00:37:26.181 --> 00:37:38.191]  Major newspapers are reporting that in middle-class neighborhoods, undamaged by floodwaters, paramilitary police are going door-to-door demanding citizens' firearms.
[00:37:38.231 --> 00:37:44.817]  The New York Times even admitted that this is so the citizenry cannot resist when they are physically forced to leave their homes.
[00:37:47.981 --> 00:37:55.826]  Most of the residents are conscientious nurses and power plant employees who are currently working in key areas of infrastructure.
[00:37:55.946 --> 00:38:01.249]  Others refuse to leave because early on they were told that they would have to break up their families to do so.
[00:38:01.829 --> 00:38:05.211]  Or they would be given no aid unless they handed over all their money and vehicles.
[00:38:05.752 --> 00:38:06.312]  That's another thing.
[00:38:07.093 --> 00:38:11.195]  Either you totally sign over to them as slaves and go to a camp or you get nothing.
[00:38:11.775 --> 00:38:15.798]  Still more refuse to leave and give up beloved family pets.
[00:38:17.242 --> 00:38:27.738]  Holdouts, many of whom have a year's supply of food and water filters, tell the police we're the people who stopped the looters when you guys were nowhere to be seen in the first six days.
[00:38:28.470 --> 00:38:38.539]  So the federal government does a horrible job delivering food and water to people, they told to go to the Superdome, and now almost two weeks later, they say the city is under their control, and their main mission?
[00:38:39.019 --> 00:38:42.822]  Go door-to-door and confiscate American citizens' lawfully owned firearms.
[00:38:43.243 --> 00:38:50.869]  This is treason, this is sedition, against the Constitution and the Bill of Rights and our way of life!
[00:38:51.189 --> 00:38:52.891]  You are killing this country!
[00:38:54.588 --> 00:38:55.688]  I love this country, folks.
[00:38:55.708 --> 00:38:56.709]  This is where we live.
[00:38:56.729 --> 00:38:57.909]  This is our heritage.
[00:38:58.309 --> 00:38:59.709]  This is everything we are.
[00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:01.250]  Everything!
[00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:03.070]  This country's dying right now.
[00:39:04.591 --> 00:39:09.992]  I have been to over ten urban warfare training drills where the military and the police work together.
[00:39:10.012 --> 00:39:15.574]  The national news always reports that it's a disaster relief training, but in truth,
[00:39:16.886 --> 00:39:24.131]  What they are doing is training to greedily subdue peaceful populations, disarm them, and break up families.
[00:39:24.251 --> 00:39:25.292]  I've videotaped it.
[00:39:25.312 --> 00:39:25.932]  You've seen it.
[00:39:27.253 --> 00:39:31.677]  Oh, they've got such horrible things planned for all of us if we don't stop them.
[00:39:32.937 --> 00:39:37.421]  Remember back in 93 when Bill Clinton announced weapon sweeps of public housing without warrants?
[00:39:38.742 --> 00:39:41.463]  They did it to the disadvantage then and most people didn't care.
[00:39:41.564 --> 00:39:44.846]  Now they're doing it to the middle class in plain view of the world.
[00:39:45.538 --> 00:39:49.740]  They're setting a precedent to take your property, to take your children, to take your guns.
[00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:54.242]  The courts have ruled over and over again that the police have no obligation to protect the public.
[00:39:55.243 --> 00:40:02.707]  At the same time, police have been trained that there really isn't a Second Amendment, and that Americans really don't have the right to protect themselves.
[00:40:03.607 --> 00:40:10.711]  This unfolding gun confiscation tragedy stands as a monument to the true intentions of this parasitic, degenerate government.
[00:40:12.179 --> 00:40:14.320]  It wants you disarmed and under heel.
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:17.301]  It wants slaves, subjects, not citizens.
[00:40:17.981 --> 00:40:28.384]  The law-abiding, gun-owning citizens of New Orleans are having their lifelines severed, and the American people are witnessing a giant gun confiscation drill, a laboratory, a simulation.
[00:40:29.905 --> 00:40:31.766]  This will be used nationwide, folks, you watch.
[00:40:32.406 --> 00:40:38.728]  There should be a howling, screaming, the likes of which have never been heard, against the Bush administration.
[00:40:39.545 --> 00:40:40.946]  That is in control of New Orleans.
[00:40:41.006 --> 00:40:50.730]  If we let them legitimize gun confiscation as if it brings some kind of security, which it doesn't, they're going to use this all over the country.
[00:40:51.190 --> 00:40:59.714]  Lord Bush is already licking his lips and talking about making Gonzalez, a person who is adamantly anti-gun, his pick to secede Rehnquist!
[00:41:01.915 --> 00:41:01.995]  Ugh!
[00:41:03.948 --> 00:41:12.936]  I mean, he doubled the size of the BATF, and you scumbag neocon worshippers, you're the worst scum there is.
[00:41:14.397 --> 00:41:23.645]  You've emailed me, you've called me, you've laughed at me in the street, you've giggled through your toothless mouths, that that's some kind of conservatism.
[00:41:26.167 --> 00:41:27.488]  That it's conservative!
[00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.151]  That it's conservative!
[00:41:33.757 --> 00:41:36.840]  That it's conservative to double the size of the BATF.
[00:41:37.841 --> 00:41:42.184]  Well, Bush said we got a right to own guns in this beach.
[00:41:42.865 --> 00:41:46.208]  Well, yeah, the enemy drives up and camouflaged tanks, too.
[00:41:47.869 --> 00:41:52.933]  Just because a tank's got camouflage on it doesn't make it a tree, because it's got a tree pattern on it.
[00:41:54.635 --> 00:41:55.756]  This is not an assault.
[00:41:56.454 --> 00:41:56.974]  Don't none.
[00:41:57.014 --> 00:41:57.935]  We are your friends.
[00:41:58.515 --> 00:42:00.857]  Just open the gates and we'll be friendly.
[00:42:01.197 --> 00:42:02.198]  We just want to help you.
[00:42:02.498 --> 00:42:03.619]  Open your castle gates.
[00:42:03.739 --> 00:42:05.100]  Come on, you idiots!
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:06.821]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:42:06.841 --> 00:42:13.305]  I'm not talking to our general audience, but the morons that listen that won't call in but send me their little giggling emails.
[00:42:13.545 --> 00:42:14.906]  This isn't funny, okay?
[00:42:15.587 --> 00:42:18.288]  And I know deep down you're afraid, and you know it's tyranny.
[00:42:18.308 --> 00:42:19.129]  You're subconscious.
[00:42:19.753 --> 00:42:23.114]  You know, your heart, your soul, you know in your guts this is bad.
[00:42:23.655 --> 00:42:26.336]  So you make a little split-second decision to giggle about it.
[00:42:27.056 --> 00:42:36.179]  Well, you'll be squealing like a little pig when it's going into the slaughter pens in a few years from now, or maybe even sooner, and you'll be wishing somebody would help you.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:39.460]  Of course, a lot of you will just toady up and be part of the system.
[00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:46.023]  They'll give you a little armband, a little uniform under the National Compulsory Service Act.
[00:42:46.832 --> 00:42:47.933]  Literally, that sits in there.
[00:42:48.233 --> 00:42:54.738]  And you'll strut around and... We don't put up with criticizing the government.
[00:42:55.018 --> 00:42:56.659]  Not when things are this bad.
[00:42:56.699 --> 00:42:59.921]  We gotta... We gots to get behind the government to fix things.
[00:43:00.001 --> 00:43:01.222]  I hear that all over talk radio.
[00:43:01.442 --> 00:43:05.925]  It's time to start arresting these people who are criticizing the government in a time of war.
[00:43:05.945 --> 00:43:08.287]  Well, that's just un-American.
[00:43:08.367 --> 00:43:10.789]  No, you're un-American, you trash.
[00:43:12.592 --> 00:43:29.077]  I say to all the good police and all the good military and all the good people that love liberty and love freedom who are outraged like I am, I ask you to be leaders and speak up and drive around with bullhorns hanging out of your car telling people this is wrong and to print up a newsletter this weekend.
[00:43:29.157 --> 00:43:30.398]  I want it written up.
[00:43:30.738 --> 00:43:34.779]  I want it printed up at Kinko's and I want thousands of them out in every town.
[00:43:35.059 --> 00:43:36.720]  I don't want you to wait for somebody else.
[00:43:38.052 --> 00:43:45.238]  I want you to get out there, and I want you to speak out, and I want you to expose the New World Order, and I want you to exert yourselves against the enemy!
[00:43:45.499 --> 00:43:48.581]  For your families, for your children, for your women!
[00:43:48.601 --> 00:43:51.364]  This is everything on the line!
[00:43:51.524 --> 00:43:55.487]  This is everything we've warned you about all these years!
[00:43:55.628 --> 00:43:56.448]  It's coming!
[00:43:57.149 --> 00:43:58.650]  It's coming, it's here!
[00:43:58.890 --> 00:44:00.492]  This is only the beginning!
[00:44:01.573 --> 00:44:03.454]  Like Patrick Henry said, why wait?
[00:44:03.474 --> 00:44:05.156]  We're here idle, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:44:06.212 --> 00:44:10.395]  It's already the resounding clash of arms is in New Orleans right now!
[00:44:10.816 --> 00:44:15.299]  The enemy's already attacking our brethren right now on the Gulf Coast!
[00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:17.561]  And tomorrow it's gonna be here!
[00:44:18.729 --> 00:44:23.693]  We have laid down, we have begged them, we have talked to them, we have asked them to stop it!
[00:44:23.853 --> 00:44:25.014]  We've asked for quarter!
[00:44:25.194 --> 00:44:29.738]  We've asked for them to stop violating our rights and taxing us and being so corrupt!
[00:44:30.158 --> 00:44:32.060]  We've done everything we could!
[00:44:32.280 --> 00:44:44.530]  We have worked and pushed and driven and all our enemies have done is erected great armies against us knowing that they got stuff planned so horrible that we will be forced to physically resist them!
[00:44:47.236 --> 00:44:55.143]  In their arrogance, King George II and his corporate interests have risen up great armies against us!
[00:44:55.704 --> 00:44:57.525]  They have employed them against us!
[00:44:57.886 --> 00:45:01.549]  They have used asset forfeiture seizure to feed on us!
[00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:04.712]  They have treated us like trash!
[00:45:04.752 --> 00:45:06.994]  They have lined us up like enemy prisoners!
[00:45:07.194 --> 00:45:09.256]  They have demanded to see our papers!
[00:45:10.006 --> 00:45:15.268]  They've left our borders wide open the entire time they've been raping and pillaging us!
[00:45:15.588 --> 00:45:19.509]  Just like they left the borders for the frontier open in 1776.
[00:45:19.949 --> 00:45:26.531]  You read that Declaration of Independence and it's the exact same thing that's happening right now!
[00:45:31.522 --> 00:45:32.483]  This is a drill.
[00:45:32.683 --> 00:45:34.304]  This is a drill for the nuke attacks.
[00:45:34.324 --> 00:45:40.848]  This is a drill for the bio-attacks, which our government, our criminal, hijacked government, has said is going to happen.
[00:45:41.869 --> 00:45:45.311]  And this kind of stuff you're seeing is going to be nationwide.
[00:45:49.554 --> 00:45:51.515]  And even if you've got a ranch or place in the country,
[00:45:52.225 --> 00:45:55.586]  You'll have a few months after they carry it out, and then the troops will come marching down your street.
[00:45:55.606 --> 00:45:57.306]  We're commandeering this for refugees.
[00:45:57.586 --> 00:45:58.507]  We're taking this over.
[00:45:58.527 --> 00:45:59.987]  And by the way, you can't have guns.
[00:46:00.427 --> 00:46:02.828]  And folks, if you give in to them at that time, it's over.
[00:46:04.528 --> 00:46:05.708]  It's gonna be bad, folks.
[00:46:05.768 --> 00:46:06.769]  This is the model.
[00:46:06.829 --> 00:46:08.369]  We have the Pentagon documents.
[00:46:09.529 --> 00:46:10.750]  They want... Do you understand?
[00:46:10.770 --> 00:46:12.290]  They don't care about the shopping malls.
[00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:14.650]  They don't care about your 401ks.
[00:46:14.670 --> 00:46:15.871]  They don't care about it.
[00:46:15.891 --> 00:46:17.691]  Do you understand?
[00:46:17.711 --> 00:46:20.932]  They got a bunch of idiots that will follow any order they give them.
[00:46:22.617 --> 00:46:24.238]  And this is all a beta test.
[00:46:25.058 --> 00:46:26.479]  I know I'm ranting and raving, folks.
[00:46:27.659 --> 00:46:32.641]  The security agreements are public to bring Mexican and Canadian troops in here to police and run your life.
[00:46:32.921 --> 00:46:35.022]  And now the armed Mexican troops are here in Texas.
[00:46:36.107 --> 00:46:41.409]  And no, don't email me saying they're on TV giving people soup in San Antonio.
[00:46:41.429 --> 00:46:42.929]  That's one of the convoys.
[00:46:43.289 --> 00:46:44.970]  I'm talking about the other convoys.
[00:46:45.330 --> 00:46:46.930]  And they're here to just set a precedent.
[00:46:47.230 --> 00:46:49.691]  I'm not saying they're going to run around and start doing something.
[00:46:49.991 --> 00:46:52.632]  It's all to get you ready to domesticate you.
[00:46:52.852 --> 00:46:54.513]  You're being bathed in evil.
[00:46:54.833 --> 00:46:56.493]  You're being bathed in slavery.
[00:46:56.673 --> 00:46:59.254]  You're being like a siren song.
[00:46:59.274 --> 00:47:05.436]  You're being mesmerized, enchanted, beguiled like a snake does a bird as its eyes spin.
[00:47:06.974 --> 00:47:10.637]  Break your conditioning, good lord, to the police out there.
[00:47:10.657 --> 00:47:12.879]  They're going to take everything you got, you fools!
[00:47:13.459 --> 00:47:14.180]  You idiots!
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:17.902]  I'm talking about the police that are stupid, not the good ones that know what's going on.
[00:47:19.263 --> 00:47:24.848]  Charles in Louisiana has been calling in and giving us reports, and I'm sorry if I'm angry, but I'm just telling it like it is.
[00:47:24.948 --> 00:47:26.189]  I mean, we are under attack.
[00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:28.310]  Charles, you're there in the middle of it.
[00:47:28.611 --> 00:47:29.671]  Give us your report, sir.
[00:47:29.691 --> 00:47:31.373]  Well, I'm going to try to be slow.
[00:47:31.473 --> 00:47:32.914]  I just don't break out in tears.
[00:47:33.214 --> 00:47:34.555]  I mean, I pray you hear me.
[00:47:34.895 --> 00:47:35.656]  I pray you hear me.
[00:47:38.453 --> 00:47:46.516]  It's the... They're kicking doors in and searching down, telling women, you might... Raise that dress up here.
[00:47:46.556 --> 00:47:47.977]  I want to see if you got a gun in there.
[00:47:49.457 --> 00:47:54.319]  Our military that we save is our boys, support our boys.
[00:47:54.639 --> 00:47:56.380]  I never want to hear that phrase again.
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.541]  They're animals.
[00:47:59.561 --> 00:48:00.161]  They're animals.
[00:48:01.042 --> 00:48:02.082]  They're police animals.
[00:48:03.443 --> 00:48:05.263]  These houses ain't flooded.
[00:48:05.304 --> 00:48:06.304]  These are beautiful homes.
[00:48:07.657 --> 00:48:11.139]  And they're arresting people because they say they're not giving their guns up.
[00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:12.920]  People say, I don't have no guns.
[00:48:12.960 --> 00:48:14.782]  They're putting plastic handcuffs on them.
[00:48:14.962 --> 00:48:17.663]  Women, men, everybody.
[00:48:18.124 --> 00:48:20.205]  If they feel like they got guns, they're arresting them.
[00:48:20.225 --> 00:48:21.406]  They're bringing them out on boats.
[00:48:22.707 --> 00:48:24.028]  And let me explain something to you.
[00:48:25.048 --> 00:48:29.391]  When these Mexican troops come here, all they're going to want is American women.
[00:48:30.197 --> 00:48:35.261]  Because the women are being searched illegally, looking at their private parts for guns.
[00:48:35.281 --> 00:48:37.883]  I mean, my God!
[00:48:38.244 --> 00:48:39.004]  I can't believe!
[00:48:39.685 --> 00:48:40.926]  I can't believe it's happening!
[00:48:40.986 --> 00:48:42.327]  I'm seeing it, Mr. Jones!
[00:48:42.347 --> 00:48:43.648]  I'm seeing it.
[00:48:45.169 --> 00:48:49.673]  I can't believe that New Orleans gave their guns up.
[00:48:50.573 --> 00:48:53.376]  I can't believe that the police turned against their own citizens.
[00:48:53.736 --> 00:48:55.177]  Cruelly, cruelly turned!
[00:48:55.537 --> 00:48:56.638]  I mean, cruelly turned!
[00:48:56.658 --> 00:48:58.500]  They're talking to these people like they're animals!
[00:49:00.291 --> 00:49:02.132]  Right now I feel no hope.
[00:49:02.392 --> 00:49:03.952]  My heart is about to bust.
[00:49:04.732 --> 00:49:06.153]  I can't go down there no more.
[00:49:06.173 --> 00:49:07.693]  I'm not going on the bus no more.
[00:49:09.094 --> 00:49:12.495]  I can't do it because I don't think I can make another day of it.
[00:49:13.295 --> 00:49:14.696]  We've been overtook.
[00:49:15.776 --> 00:49:18.257]  The people have been deceived.
[00:49:19.177 --> 00:49:20.277]  We have no out.
[00:49:21.078 --> 00:49:26.099]  I don't even... When these Mexican troops come down here, they're going to confiscate us.
[00:49:26.799 --> 00:49:28.520]  This morning I was so tired.
[00:49:28.962 --> 00:49:32.287]  I went to a restaurant and a man said, your name's Charlie?
[00:49:32.648 --> 00:49:34.370]  I said, yeah, my name's Charlie.
[00:49:34.651 --> 00:49:37.656]  He said, no, my name's Ben and I understand you know what's happening.
[00:49:38.216 --> 00:49:39.098]  I said, what do you want?
[00:49:39.454 --> 00:49:43.918]  He said, do you think they're going to take that ban off them bullets where we can have hunting season?
[00:49:44.058 --> 00:49:44.818]  I said, I don't know.
[00:49:44.838 --> 00:49:46.600]  He said, there's going to be some mad hunters down here.
[00:49:47.621 --> 00:49:49.222]  That fool's talking about hunting.
[00:49:49.662 --> 00:49:56.188]  Your whole history, 232 years of America is going down the toilet.
[00:49:56.228 --> 00:49:59.931]  Do you realize women are being searched, stripped down in New Orleans?
[00:50:00.609 --> 00:50:06.013]  Listen, they're going to middle-class neighborhoods that were not flooded, and it's boon gang members.
[00:50:06.053 --> 00:50:08.635]  Look, already most of our military is foreign to begin with.
[00:50:08.655 --> 00:50:09.375]  A big percentage of it.
[00:50:09.395 --> 00:50:10.276]  Yeah, they're going to mansions.
[00:50:10.716 --> 00:50:13.498]  And these foreign troops are going to have on masks.
[00:50:13.518 --> 00:50:14.759]  You're not going to know who's who.
[00:50:15.719 --> 00:50:16.800]  They want confusion.
[00:50:17.281 --> 00:50:22.364]  Dick Cheney's already down here on the coast looking at his new property for his casinos and all that.
[00:50:23.125 --> 00:50:24.285]  But I'm telling you something.
[00:50:24.926 --> 00:50:28.028]  If the people don't fight today, it's over.
[00:50:28.866 --> 00:50:29.446]  It's over.
[00:50:29.486 --> 00:50:32.108]  Don't worry about hunting in your football games.
[00:50:32.488 --> 00:50:34.089]  They're coming in our neighborhood.
[00:50:34.189 --> 00:50:35.750]  Please, Louisiana, listen to me.
[00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:37.211]  They're coming here.
[00:50:37.331 --> 00:50:38.572]  I swear I've been up there.
[00:50:38.592 --> 00:50:39.832]  Y'all know me down here.
[00:50:40.473 --> 00:50:42.274]  Y'all know.
[00:50:42.334 --> 00:50:43.314]  Well, stay there, Charles.
[00:50:43.334 --> 00:50:44.015]  We'll let you finish up.
[00:50:44.075 --> 00:50:44.995]  I mean, it's on the news.
[00:50:45.816 --> 00:50:47.357]  I mean, we're not going to bring any food or water.
[00:50:47.397 --> 00:50:48.697]  We're here to get your guns.
[00:50:48.797 --> 00:50:49.458]  We don't care.
[00:50:50.531 --> 00:50:52.032]  We don't care if you're a local nurse!
[00:50:52.512 --> 00:50:54.553]  We want your gun, slave!
[00:50:54.573 --> 00:50:59.776]  Now, they even say it so that we can't resist them with what they got planned next!
[00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:05.379]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:07.361]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.561 --> 00:51:13.304]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.584 --> 00:51:18.787]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:19.107 --> 00:51:23.290]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:27.233]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.473 --> 00:51:32.097]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:32.197 --> 00:51:38.461]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.502 --> 00:51:40.323]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:40.803 --> 00:51:42.905]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:51:42.985 --> 00:51:46.347]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:46.647 --> 00:51:49.389]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:51:50.129 --> 00:51:54.512]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:51:54.632 --> 00:51:56.613]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:51:56.853 --> 00:51:58.374]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:58.534 --> 00:52:00.616]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:01.508 --> 00:52:09.034]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.315 --> 00:52:20.224]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.484 --> 00:52:22.286]  Yet require very little energy.
[00:52:22.566 --> 00:52:25.889]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:27.551]  But it's worth every penny.
[00:52:27.691 --> 00:52:36.660]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:37.460]  That's right!
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:44.762]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:45.042 --> 00:52:49.184]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:52:49.344 --> 00:52:53.785]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.845 --> 00:52:54.305]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.319 --> 00:53:03.839]  Thank you.
[00:53:18.744 --> 00:53:19.125]  I think so.
[00:53:39.005 --> 00:53:39.405]  I think so.
[00:54:03.952 --> 00:54:09.974]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.594 --> 00:54:13.535]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:14.355 --> 00:54:23.057]  We have a criminal gang of social engineers that have hijacked control of our government, who are manifestly evil.
[00:54:23.237 --> 00:54:28.918]  I mean, just every form of open corruption, every form of open butchery of the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:32.641]  Every form of just out-of-control behavior.
[00:54:33.762 --> 00:54:39.945]  I mean, the favorite agency that the feds like to use for security work is DynCorp, caught kidnapping 200,000 women and children.
[00:54:40.205 --> 00:54:41.986]  And we play the congressional clips.
[00:54:43.367 --> 00:54:46.449]  And Rumsfeld says, well, they got, you know, a fine for that.
[00:54:47.469 --> 00:54:48.770]  Just let's move on to the next question.
[00:54:48.790 --> 00:54:49.990]  I mean, it's not even denied, folks.
[00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:52.152]  You understand how evil they are?
[00:54:53.132 --> 00:54:54.033]  And I mean all of them.
[00:54:54.073 --> 00:54:55.413]  Bill Clinton, all of them.
[00:54:55.433 --> 00:54:58.315]  It's a pack of, a pack of just
[00:55:00.090 --> 00:55:01.171]  They're not cockroaches.
[00:55:01.211 --> 00:55:02.431]  Cockroaches serve a purpose.
[00:55:02.471 --> 00:55:05.612]  These are just like... These are just psychopaths.
[00:55:06.653 --> 00:55:10.294]  And they're cold, and they're intelligent, and you're just so gullible.
[00:55:11.414 --> 00:55:15.456]  And I understand folks going around making people leave their houses and confiscating their guns.
[00:55:15.496 --> 00:55:22.318]  And they say in the New York Times, they've got a police chief in there, well we've got to confiscate their guns because then we're going to forcibly take them, you know, remove them.
[00:55:25.219 --> 00:55:26.580]  And we don't want them to resist.
[00:55:27.432 --> 00:55:33.497]  And you've got areas of the city on the edge that aren't flooded, that aren't cut off, that have major roads going out to the hinterland.
[00:55:33.677 --> 00:55:34.558]  They're totally fine.
[00:55:34.778 --> 00:55:36.760]  CDC admits no waterborne diseases.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.281]  There's some E. coli in the water.
[00:55:38.321 --> 00:55:38.882]  That'll go away.
[00:55:38.902 --> 00:55:40.303]  It's already going away.
[00:55:40.323 --> 00:55:42.045]  You know, it dies over time.
[00:55:42.605 --> 00:55:44.026]  E. coli is naturally in.
[00:55:44.046 --> 00:55:45.868]  You know, any swamp, it's going away.
[00:55:49.211 --> 00:55:51.533]  Again, the Supreme Court said you don't own your own private property.
[00:55:51.713 --> 00:55:53.194]  This is all being set up here.
[00:55:53.615 --> 00:55:54.956]  Charles, finish up what you were
[00:55:56.542 --> 00:56:06.456]  I mean, for those that don't understand, and then I have another New York Times article here where they admit that it's superintendents and nurses and power plant employees who have to stay there and work to keep things running!
[00:56:07.091 --> 00:56:09.072]  And the cops just go, we got orders, get out of here!
[00:56:09.092 --> 00:56:09.972]  And they're like, what do you mean?
[00:56:10.012 --> 00:56:10.692]  Where do you live?
[00:56:10.952 --> 00:56:11.773]  Well, I got a house.
[00:56:11.993 --> 00:56:14.354]  Oh, they even admit the cops get to keep their houses.
[00:56:14.614 --> 00:56:15.634]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[00:56:16.154 --> 00:56:23.897]  Cops are in the uninflooded areas, and people with Blackwater Security, total CIA front, that's in the article, they get to have all the machine guns they want.
[00:56:24.117 --> 00:56:25.498]  That's one of Dick Cheney's outfits.
[00:56:26.198 --> 00:56:28.799]  All these big corporations have their own private merc gangs.
[00:56:29.499 --> 00:56:30.939]  Well, they can have all the guns they want.
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:33.580]  But just the average citizens are like, get out!
[00:56:34.661 --> 00:56:35.181]  Oh, man.
[00:56:36.579 --> 00:56:38.940]  I tell you what, folks, and this is setting the precedent.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:41.301]  Breaking the mold on America, folks.
[00:56:43.322 --> 00:56:45.263]  They're actually engaging in siege now.
[00:56:45.303 --> 00:56:48.065]  We're not going to let you out on the roads out of here to get food and water.
[00:56:48.505 --> 00:56:49.766]  We're not going to let you leave.
[00:56:50.166 --> 00:56:52.627]  By the way, come on out of there and give us your guns!
[00:56:53.527 --> 00:56:54.268]  Come on out of there!
[00:56:55.288 --> 00:56:56.609]  I mean, look, look, this is like
[00:56:57.694 --> 00:56:58.875]  Road Warrior or something.
[00:56:58.895 --> 00:57:00.596]  This is like Breakdown of Society.
[00:57:00.876 --> 00:57:02.336]  Escape from New York, folks.
[00:57:02.577 --> 00:57:06.318]  The government raving, roving criminals.
[00:57:06.699 --> 00:57:15.063]  And the cops still following orders of FEMA who's cutting their communications lines and jamming their communications and... Charles, finish up.
[00:57:15.563 --> 00:57:17.264]  Well, that's about it.
[00:57:18.145 --> 00:57:20.466]  I don't... I might call in a couple.
[00:57:21.426 --> 00:57:23.047]  I won't call in a while.
[00:57:23.527 --> 00:57:25.308]  I don't think my heart...
[00:57:27.239 --> 00:57:28.399]  Well, you've been up to New Orleans.
[00:57:28.439 --> 00:57:29.220]  Just settle down.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.420]  I know we should be angry, but you've been up there.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:31.880]  What?
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:32.961]  I mean, how bad is it?
[00:57:33.021 --> 00:57:34.681]  Because it's pretty bad on the news.
[00:57:35.041 --> 00:57:36.922]  I mean, they say they're viciously taking guns.
[00:57:37.262 --> 00:57:38.922]  I mean, how bad is it?
[00:57:39.182 --> 00:57:43.424]  Well, I'm not dead threatening or anything, but they're kicking doors down, house to house.
[00:57:43.444 --> 00:57:44.644]  They're going house to house.
[00:57:45.704 --> 00:57:47.145]  And it ain't that nice about it, pal.
[00:57:47.825 --> 00:57:49.025]  They're using a lot of force.
[00:57:49.085 --> 00:57:53.266]  They're still arresting people if they feel they ain't giving their guns up to arrest women.
[00:57:53.707 --> 00:57:54.247]  Anybody.
[00:57:54.727 --> 00:57:55.207]  Anybody.
[00:57:55.911 --> 00:57:59.414]  And they're kicking the doors in where they can't lock the doors for protection.
[00:57:59.554 --> 00:58:00.695]  And this is all a test!
[00:58:00.915 --> 00:58:01.735]  The police is looting!
[00:58:02.136 --> 00:58:03.016]  The police is looting!
[00:58:03.136 --> 00:58:03.837]  You understand what I mean?
[00:58:03.897 --> 00:58:04.537]  Of course they are!
[00:58:04.557 --> 00:58:06.799]  They're trying to protect themselves from the police!
[00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:08.280]  You understand?
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.881]  That's just the sad part about it!
[00:58:10.061 --> 00:58:12.483]  Well, Charles, this is a huge beta test, see?
[00:58:13.164 --> 00:58:15.385]  This is getting everybody used to it, and then it's in the news.
[00:58:15.565 --> 00:58:16.166]  Door to door.
[00:58:16.786 --> 00:58:17.407]  Come out of there!
[00:58:17.467 --> 00:58:18.327]  Get down!
[00:58:18.508 --> 00:58:19.688]  Where's your guns, woman?
[00:58:19.889 --> 00:58:21.290]  Where's your... Let me tell you.
[00:58:21.330 --> 00:58:22.951]  You tell me, man, where your guns are!
[00:58:23.638 --> 00:58:24.318]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:58:24.498 --> 00:58:25.919]  Dress up, make sure they ain't got guns.
[00:58:26.179 --> 00:58:29.180]  Lookin' at this, the women, this is ridiculous!
[00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:32.380]  It's abomination, Mr. Jones!
[00:58:33.001 --> 00:58:36.402]  We don't have any food for you, but we got a jackboot slave!
[00:58:36.422 --> 00:58:39.422]  We've been waitin' a long time for an excuse to do this!
[00:58:41.223 --> 00:58:46.124]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.738 --> 00:58:58.378]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.038 --> 00:59:00.139]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.820 --> 00:59:01.980]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.581 --> 00:59:03.421]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.162 --> 00:59:05.122]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.723 --> 00:59:09.385]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.905 --> 00:59:12.247]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[00:59:13.127 --> 00:59:14.028]  Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.389 --> 00:59:20.054]  A hijacker, a hijacker who hijacks an airplane is not the pilot.
[00:59:20.674 --> 00:59:23.977]  And the criminals that have hijacked our government are not the government.
[00:59:24.337 --> 00:59:25.238]  They're illegitimate.
[00:59:25.679 --> 00:59:34.607]  And they're clearly doing gun confiscations door-to-door of all guns, all wildlife citizens, even key infrastructure workers that live in the city in safe areas.
[00:59:35.806 --> 00:59:36.667]  It is just vicious.
[00:59:36.727 --> 00:59:37.268]  It is evil.
[00:59:37.288 --> 00:59:39.089]  It is to see how much they can get away with.
[00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:45.095]  We got George Galloway, Member of Parliament, coming up talking about several big issues for about 25 minutes in the next segment.
[00:59:46.136 --> 00:59:47.938]  And we're going to be taking your calls throughout the day.
[00:59:47.978 --> 00:59:51.401]  And we have a detailed report about the Mexican troops armed in Texas.
[00:59:52.159 --> 01:00:06.504]  Totally documented, and right now let's go to Ron in New York, retired New York police officer, to get his take on armed, fat-bellied goons going door-to-door in unflooded middle-class areas, dragging families out, handcuffing fathers.
[01:00:07.084 --> 01:00:10.645]  It's on the news, if they think they have guns and are hiding them.
[01:00:11.085 --> 01:00:12.606]  So now you've got the thought police out.
[01:00:12.646 --> 01:00:13.946]  Meanwhile, there's no resistance.
[01:00:14.326 --> 01:00:15.687]  Everybody's just going along with this.
[01:00:15.727 --> 01:00:16.667]  There's no more looting.
[01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:18.328]  Now that burns itself out.
[01:00:18.368 --> 01:00:18.668]  Go ahead.
[01:00:20.003 --> 01:00:25.485]  Well, Alex, the fact of the matter is, it is strange that they send people in, they send troops, goons in.
[01:00:25.525 --> 01:00:29.066]  They're goons, there's no legitimacy, let's not even call them troops or police.
[01:00:29.526 --> 01:00:33.207]  A criminal is a criminal regardless of what type of clothing or uniform he wears.
[01:00:33.667 --> 01:00:39.008]  And at this stage, these people are nothing more than criminals employed by government, period.
[01:00:39.288 --> 01:00:39.869]  Simple as that.
[01:00:40.029 --> 01:00:44.510]  Ron, you've been listening for five years, it's all coming true, just like clockwork.
[01:00:45.915 --> 01:00:48.016]  I knew this was coming twelve years ago.
[01:00:48.637 --> 01:00:53.999]  After they burnt out the church at Waco, you had to be blind not to know what direction this system was moving in.
[01:00:54.660 --> 01:00:56.681]  I don't want to digress to that.
[01:00:56.701 --> 01:01:02.543]  And by the way, the Supreme Head, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was the head general that ordered the killings at Waco.
[01:01:02.724 --> 01:01:10.067]  The second you had American law enforcement and military personnel not think twice about immolating American children, you knew what direction this was coming.
[01:01:10.087 --> 01:01:12.148]  And then notice, Shoemaker shot right to the top.
[01:01:14.011 --> 01:01:17.695]  But, after that, I want to say that let's deal with this exigent topic.
[01:01:18.575 --> 01:01:22.659]  They didn't send in troops when the looting was occurring, which, by the way, was exaggerated.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:27.724]  There was what we would consider, by any normal social standard, looting, yes, in the early days of the flooding.
[01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:28.845]  It was minimal.
[01:01:28.906 --> 01:01:34.351]  Most people were just trying to survive, though there was a small number of elements who were stealing televisions and so forth.
[01:01:35.173 --> 01:01:36.994]  However, they didn't send troops in at that point.
[01:01:37.054 --> 01:01:44.356]  Now they send troops in to remove probably what is a small segment of what we would call good citizens from within the city.
[01:01:45.017 --> 01:01:53.920]  Listen, even the New York Times has to admit, this is mainly middle-class government people in areas that aren't cut off, that aren't flooded, that are totally free.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:58.261]  There are areas at the edge of that city to which the flood did not completely swamp.
[01:01:58.321 --> 01:01:59.322]  They have nice homes.
[01:01:59.362 --> 01:02:00.502]  They are above the waterline.
[01:02:01.022 --> 01:02:05.285]  And that's when we send the troops in who come down like gangbusters on these people.
[01:02:05.726 --> 01:02:08.588]  Now, the larger question is, too, with regards to the Mexican troops.
[01:02:08.608 --> 01:02:09.549]  It's kind of ironic.
[01:02:09.569 --> 01:02:15.493]  The New York Daily News reported it on page 901 today, in a small column about one inch long.
[01:02:15.914 --> 01:02:24.080]  The bottom of the page, it's Mexican troops were in New Orleans, and it's the first time since the Mexican-American War that foreign troops have ever been on American soil.
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:26.662]  The question becomes, why do we need troops?
[01:02:27.262 --> 01:02:28.424]  Why do we need foreign troops?
[01:02:28.464 --> 01:02:31.389]  Why couldn't we have 200 civilian Mexican aid workers?
[01:02:31.769 --> 01:02:33.592]  What was the necessity to bring troops in?
[01:02:33.632 --> 01:02:36.777]  What more can they do except to maybe shoot American citizens?
[01:02:37.197 --> 01:02:41.524]  Then let's say an aid worker from Mexico, a civilian aid worker... Let me add this, let me add this...
[01:02:42.365 --> 01:02:43.205]  Let me add this, Ron.
[01:02:43.265 --> 01:02:48.227]  In my article that Paul and I wrote, we have where earlier this year the Marines went to bury a Mexican Marine.
[01:02:48.527 --> 01:02:53.268]  They had toy guns, and the Mexican troops ran up, physically assaulted them, and grabbed them away.
[01:02:53.708 --> 01:03:00.390]  So see, that's how they act, the toy guns in Mexico, but then they're up here armed, running around, and you're absolutely right.
[01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.030]  This is about setting precedents.
[01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:07.812]  Our government has signed an agreement with Mexico to bring them in here to quote, deal with disasters and terrorists.
[01:03:07.972 --> 01:03:13.555]  That's because this government, please don't call it our government, call it this government, call it an imposing power.
[01:03:13.675 --> 01:03:15.296]  That's what it has become.
[01:03:15.796 --> 01:03:19.479]  I believe it is made now with this issue in New Orleans, this tragedy.
[01:03:19.959 --> 01:03:21.820]  The position is crystallized.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.002]  We know what they are, unless you are insane or blind.
[01:03:25.022 --> 01:03:27.083]  We know what they are, and please hold me over.
[01:03:27.143 --> 01:03:27.523]  I hear the music.
[01:03:27.543 --> 01:03:28.824]  Well, listen, I got Galloway coming up.
[01:03:28.844 --> 01:03:30.585]  If you want to hold a while, you can come talk after.
[01:03:31.105 --> 01:03:31.385]  Okay.
[01:03:31.566 --> 01:03:31.806]  Okay.
[01:03:31.866 --> 01:03:33.867]  And everybody else, he'll be on with us for a couple of segments.
[01:03:34.207 --> 01:03:38.531]  George Galloway, great member of parliament over in England, joining us.
[01:03:38.871 --> 01:03:39.852]  Heaven help us, folks.
[01:03:39.932 --> 01:03:43.854]  I mean, the government has used this as a way to really get control.
[01:03:44.495 --> 01:03:47.837]  And, I mean, you know, here's a retired New York City police officer.
[01:03:48.598 --> 01:03:52.541]  Yesterday we had a, you know, we'll talk about when we get back.
[01:03:54.528 --> 01:03:57.390]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.630 --> 01:03:59.231]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:04.234]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.575 --> 01:04:11.299]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.639 --> 01:04:13.621]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.821 --> 01:04:16.664]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.764 --> 01:04:21.428]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.628 --> 01:04:26.032]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.272 --> 01:04:33.479]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.759 --> 01:04:36.181]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:55.299 --> 01:04:56.320]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.442]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.722 --> 01:05:03.865]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.306 --> 01:05:05.126]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.447 --> 01:05:10.010]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:12.632]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.112 --> 01:05:14.013]  Sheltering in Place!
[01:05:14.413 --> 01:05:27.823]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.863 --> 01:05:34.908]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:56.045]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:56.305 --> 01:06:00.126]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:06:00.466 --> 01:06:01.266]  Read the labels.
[01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:05.828]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:06.048 --> 01:06:10.229]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:10.609 --> 01:06:15.491]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:15.871 --> 01:06:19.454]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:19.634 --> 01:06:24.978]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[01:06:53.176 --> 01:06:58.218]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:00.919]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.199 --> 01:07:09.783]  Well, we have the honorable, esteemed member of parliament, the fire-breathing Scott, George Galloway.
[01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:13.097]  And we had him on a few months ago.
[01:07:15.859 --> 01:07:17.721]  Mr. Galloway goes to Washington.
[01:07:17.921 --> 01:07:22.945]  He's going to be traveling all over the United States, starting next week in Boston, on the 13th.
[01:07:23.125 --> 01:07:27.609]  And he's going to be with us here for about 20-25 minutes or so.
[01:07:27.629 --> 01:07:28.569]  We're really honored to have him.
[01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:29.690]  We're talking about a host of issues.
[01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:31.011]  I was just talking to him during the break.
[01:07:31.031 --> 01:07:35.355]  I was about, yeah, Tony Blair barely hung on during that special election.
[01:07:36.475 --> 01:07:40.798]  Because of the fortuitous, for him, tragic bombings in London.
[01:07:40.838 --> 01:07:43.279]  And George said, yeah, but even that's backfired on him.
[01:07:43.719 --> 01:07:45.400]  And it did come out in major British news.
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:49.222]  It just so happened the supposed mastermind is an MI6 minion.
[01:07:50.083 --> 01:07:51.363]  Just a coincidence, of course.
[01:07:52.124 --> 01:07:54.105]  And we have the total breakdown here.
[01:07:54.705 --> 01:07:55.966]  Armed Mexican troops in Texas.
[01:07:56.126 --> 01:07:56.766]  Very bizarre.
[01:07:57.547 --> 01:08:00.829]  And we have house-to-house doors being kicked in.
[01:08:00.869 --> 01:08:02.269]  Women being drug out by their hair.
[01:08:02.289 --> 01:08:03.090]  I mean, it's on TV.
[01:08:04.244 --> 01:08:09.287]  But they wouldn't bring food and water, though, but they're happy to do this to the middle class areas that weren't flooded on the outside of the city.
[01:08:10.648 --> 01:08:12.870]  It is just flagrant abuse of power.
[01:08:13.410 --> 01:08:20.234]  America, in the Gulf area, in the Southern Gulf, looks like Baghdad or something now.
[01:08:23.129 --> 01:08:31.673]  We're joined by George Galloway, who exposed the profiteering by the Bush administration, and then was demonized with made-up documents about himself.
[01:08:31.713 --> 01:08:32.834]  He's won a bunch of lawsuits.
[01:08:33.454 --> 01:08:34.655]  Totally proven to be false.
[01:08:35.055 --> 01:08:38.357]  I've been slandered in lesser ways with just total fiction as well.
[01:08:39.337 --> 01:08:44.860]  But rarely can you disprove total fiction, because the big lie is so ridiculous, people just can't believe that it's all a lie.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.481]  But he has defeated the big lie.
[01:08:46.821 --> 01:08:47.942]  George, thanks for coming on.
[01:08:48.262 --> 01:08:48.762]  You're welcome.
[01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:52.044]  And as you described the backdrop to this discussion, Alex,
[01:08:52.742 --> 01:08:57.164]  It's true, we're living in very peculiar times, and very volatile times.
[01:08:58.305 --> 01:09:06.208]  The Russian leader, Lenin, once said, there are decades when nothing happens, but there are weeks when decades happen.
[01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:11.831]  And I suspect that these weeks that we're living through now are ones in which decades are going to happen.
[01:09:12.531 --> 01:09:13.452]  Everybody feels it.
[01:09:13.472 --> 01:09:15.793]  You know, I felt the calm before the storm the last few months.
[01:09:15.853 --> 01:09:17.173]  I said, big stuff's coming.
[01:09:17.493 --> 01:09:18.614]  It's getting bigger and bigger.
[01:09:19.752 --> 01:09:32.321]  And in a sick way, the tragic events that FEMA on purpose botched has kind of diverted people off the resistance to the Iraq war coming to a head, but then that's kind of backfired.
[01:09:32.561 --> 01:09:34.703]  Can you just give us your take on all of it?
[01:09:34.723 --> 01:09:40.787]  I feel it's backfired, yes, because what you get in fact is an aggregation of people's unhappiness.
[01:09:41.288 --> 01:09:47.232]  The United States today looks like a country run by dangerous, malevolent incompetents.
[01:09:48.055 --> 01:09:53.676]  And that's very bad for the most important country in the whole world to be led by such a crew.
[01:09:54.137 --> 01:10:14.161]  And when you see Colin Powell's apologia, or what passes for one, in the last day or so, in which he admits that his performance in front of the United Nations when he dragooned the world into the war on Iraq was a blot on his record, well I can tell you it's more than a blot, it's a very large bloodstain.
[01:10:14.661 --> 01:10:16.822]  And it's a bloodstain which is spreading
[01:10:17.384 --> 01:10:17.984]  Ever wider.
[01:10:18.545 --> 01:10:22.026]  And it's a stain on the reputation of your great country.
[01:10:23.046 --> 01:10:31.470]  And I'm sorry to say that as a person who loves the United States, was looking forward to being there for 12 days or so starting next Tuesday.
[01:10:32.410 --> 01:10:41.014]  But I'm afraid that the reputation of the United States and by association, my own country has probably never been lower.
[01:10:42.825 --> 01:11:11.037]  Well, unfortunately that is the case because we're run by this corrupt military-industrial complex elite known as the Anglo-American Establishment, this nexus between Washington and London, but never before have the approval ratings for Blair been lower or Bush in the low 30s, and still he's up there smirking and giggling and his mother shooting her mouth off about how these people have got it great, and it just, it seems like Marie Antoinette and, you know, let them eat cake!
[01:11:11.617 --> 01:11:14.258]  Yes, it's like a scene from The Great Gatsby.
[01:11:14.718 --> 01:11:19.560]  But I think the key point that you make is their opinion poll ratings.
[01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:25.162]  You see, there comes a point where everyone can see that the emperors have no clothes.
[01:11:25.802 --> 01:11:28.003]  And I think that point has been reached.
[01:11:28.403 --> 01:11:32.505]  That's why I'm very optimistic about the political situation we now find ourselves in.
[01:11:33.005 --> 01:11:38.907]  Because although these people look to be gliding serenely on the surface, like the swan,
[01:11:39.449 --> 01:11:44.093]  Underneath, they are paddling like hell just to stay in control because they've been rumbled.
[01:11:44.693 --> 01:11:49.637]  And because they've been rumbled, they run the real risk of being thrown out.
[01:11:50.217 --> 01:12:01.506]  And as soon as the people of the United States get an opportunity, which I think is your midterm elections, I think you'll see some very decisive changes in the political architecture in the United States and in Britain.
[01:12:01.887 --> 01:12:03.047]  That's already underway.
[01:12:03.468 --> 01:12:07.391]  There was a halving of Mr. Blair's majority at the last general election.
[01:12:07.995 --> 01:12:13.120]  We've got local elections coming up next May, which will transform the landscape, I believe.
[01:12:13.721 --> 01:12:23.591]  And so these two great war leaders, the gruesome Twosome, Bush and Blair, have got an accounting coming, and I think it'll be coming sooner than they think.
[01:12:24.241 --> 01:12:27.983]  Now, George, I don't know how much you know about this, but when you get here, I'm sure you're going to hear about it.
[01:12:28.523 --> 01:12:38.528]  Special Electronic Voting Machine Companies, three of them, clearly CIA fronts, where they have open felons for computer hacking running elections, and
[01:12:39.748 --> 01:12:46.692]  The areas where they don't have the machines, the pro-war people lose, but in the areas where the machines are, they magically win.
[01:12:46.712 --> 01:12:50.414]  I think we're seeing them attempt to set up a dictatorship here at many levels.
[01:12:51.214 --> 01:12:58.558]  I hope you're right that we can see Libertarians or others put into office, and I see a lot of Democrats basically being clones of Bush.
[01:12:59.078 --> 01:13:02.740]  We have the Tories over there not being much different than Labor.
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:07.002]  I mean, what do you do when both parties are basically doppelgangers of each other?
[01:13:07.549 --> 01:13:10.031]  Well, this is the $64,000 question.
[01:13:10.551 --> 01:13:11.092]  What do we do?
[01:13:11.652 --> 01:13:14.014]  We have this duopoly in both countries.
[01:13:14.794 --> 01:13:16.055]  Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
[01:13:16.535 --> 01:13:19.577]  You can't slip a cigarette paper between the two of them.
[01:13:20.658 --> 01:13:27.323]  And you have to try and constructively approach such election contests as come your way.
[01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:34.328]  I wouldn't begin to suggest myself lecturing the people of the United States on how they handle it.
[01:13:34.788 --> 01:13:36.009]  We've concluded here
[01:13:36.650 --> 01:13:40.636]  That new labour is now non-labour, anti-labour.
[01:13:41.124 --> 01:14:07.209]  and can no longer be entitled to call itself entitled to the support of working people so we set up our own party called Respect which is doing very very well which as we spoke before did very well in the elections is going to do even better in the May elections next year is in the newspapers every day they're fighting each other to make documentaries about me and my trip to Washington and so on
[01:14:07.825 --> 01:14:11.427]  We really are a happening thing here in the United Kingdom.
[01:14:12.187 --> 01:14:15.309]  But I don't know what to do in the United States.
[01:14:15.449 --> 01:14:26.055]  One obvious thing to do is to use the Democratic power that you have in the primary system to try and force good candidates onto the agenda.
[01:14:26.155 --> 01:14:31.378]  Exactly, don't let them in the primaries, Republican or Democrat, don't let them select the people.
[01:14:31.538 --> 01:14:36.381]  Obviously, whoever the media is pushing, whoever the government is pushing, go to anybody but them.
[01:14:37.330 --> 01:14:40.871]  Yes, well, I think that's right, and didn't that happen to some extent?
[01:14:40.931 --> 01:14:41.711]  I'm no expert.
[01:14:42.391 --> 01:14:54.894]  With Howard Dean, that he seemed to come from nowhere, he spoke the language that people wanted to hear, he touched the zeitgeist, and he was propelled right into front-runner position.
[01:14:54.914 --> 01:14:55.994]  Now, of course, he faltered.
[01:14:56.774 --> 01:14:59.995]  Maybe there were one or two weaknesses in his game.
[01:15:00.835 --> 01:15:06.816]  But we ended up with John Kerry reporting for duty, and he sank without trace.
[01:15:07.509 --> 01:15:22.293]  And it's hardly any wonder, because when you began to look at his stand, or should I say his wobble, on the issues of the day, you began to realize that this man was only barely more competent than George Bush to hold that job.
[01:15:22.433 --> 01:15:24.373]  Well, I mean, he was totally a titular head.
[01:15:24.393 --> 01:15:29.155]  You know, frat brothers with Bush, members of the same society, their cousins, totally staged.
[01:15:29.175 --> 01:15:30.595]  I mean, that was just totally staged.
[01:15:31.515 --> 01:15:37.417]  George Galloway, before we go any further, give us the website that covers your amazing trip that's coming to the U.S.
[01:15:37.937 --> 01:15:42.058]  It's www.mrgallowaygoestowashington.com.
[01:15:42.398 --> 01:15:43.138]  All one word.
[01:15:43.178 --> 01:15:45.919]  www.mrgallowaygoestowashington.com.
[01:15:46.399 --> 01:15:49.559]  And tell us some of the cities you're going to be coming to.
[01:15:49.699 --> 01:15:53.660]  Well, I'm speaking in Boston on Tuesday, in New York on Wednesday.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.921]  I'm going up to Toronto for a couple of days then.
[01:15:56.511 --> 01:16:01.512]  Then it's Chicago, Madison, where I'm speaking on these two occasions with Jane Fonda.
[01:16:02.413 --> 01:16:03.853]  Then it's over to the West Coast.
[01:16:04.313 --> 01:16:06.854]  I'm hoping that Sean Penn and others will join us there.
[01:16:06.894 --> 01:16:07.854]  There'll be big meetings.
[01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:09.975]  I hope people will come to them.
[01:16:10.395 --> 01:16:11.775]  I think they'll be widely covered.
[01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:19.177]  Because I think, if you'll forgive the dreadful pun, I'm coming over when there's a rising tide.
[01:16:19.717 --> 01:16:25.139]  A rising tide of skepticism at worst and downright rejection at best.
[01:16:25.797 --> 01:16:26.279]  All right.
[01:16:33.473 --> 01:16:35.194]  I think a great spokesman against all this.
[01:16:35.254 --> 01:16:41.198]  Unfortunately, some of those other folks, I'm sad to say, aren't the best spokesmen because of some of their background.
[01:16:41.438 --> 01:16:43.319]  But I will tell Sean Penn this.
[01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:44.279]  I mean, I commend him.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:56.987]  He went to try to save people in New Orleans, and when he finally got past the police, FEMA would make jokes at him and take pictures of him, and then he witnessed FEMA demanding sexual favors from women to get them out of buildings.
[01:16:57.727 --> 01:17:00.069]  I mean, and that was even in some British papers.
[01:17:00.129 --> 01:17:09.175]  I mean, getting back to what's happened in New Orleans, I mean, it's just FEMA won't deliver food and water, but they will deliver jackbooted thugs.
[01:17:09.495 --> 01:17:22.303]  Yes, it's a bizarre catalogue of incompetence and malevolence and racism and all the worst things about the United States today have been on display.
[01:17:22.981 --> 01:17:24.983]  In this whole miserable saga.
[01:17:25.423 --> 01:17:31.949]  And now, as you're telling me, and as I'm beginning to pick up in the mainstream media, there's more to it than meets the eye.
[01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:39.435]  And it's really hard to work out from here now whether it was all being seized upon as a big diversion.
[01:17:40.416 --> 01:17:44.540]  If it was, as you seem to indicate it might have been, it hasn't worked.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.923]  It just compounds people's feeling.
[01:17:48.542 --> 01:17:56.128]  That the United States is run by these incompetents, by these ghoulish incompetents, Marie Antoinette-like incompetents.
[01:17:56.148 --> 01:17:59.771]  Well, you called them, you know, these out-of-control monkeys last time.
[01:18:00.612 --> 01:18:00.972]  That's right.
[01:18:00.992 --> 01:18:10.680]  I mean, I think that they are with their simian swagger and their giggling and their pretentiousness.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.361]  An absolute snapshot.
[01:18:13.721 --> 01:18:18.122]  As I say, it's almost like an F. Scott Fitzgerald caricature of the ruling class.
[01:18:18.142 --> 01:18:20.343]  No, it's like your caricatures of Mussolini and Hitler.
[01:18:21.003 --> 01:18:34.268]  Well, the danger, of course, is that when the state begins to be such an abysmal, miserable failure, as the state and the United States has been, that people turn not too progressive.
[01:18:34.884 --> 01:18:36.125]  We'll be right back, George.
[01:18:36.145 --> 01:18:37.807]  Mr. Galloway, please stay with us.
[01:18:54.026 --> 01:18:56.548]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:18:57.228 --> 01:19:06.874]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:17.301]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[01:19:18.428 --> 01:19:23.329]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.
[01:19:24.710 --> 01:19:32.432]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:33.112 --> 01:19:35.033]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:19:35.053 --> 01:19:35.393]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:19:43.187 --> 01:19:43.587]  516-8736.
[01:19:47.410 --> 01:19:48.110]  Call now.
[01:19:48.290 --> 01:19:51.953]  Operators are standing by to take your order for a free subscription.
[01:19:55.706 --> 01:20:00.190]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:00.551 --> 01:20:04.634]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:04.935 --> 01:20:05.475]  We listened.
[01:20:05.795 --> 01:20:10.760]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:11.541]  We listened.
[01:20:11.921 --> 01:20:14.964]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:15.384 --> 01:20:15.925]  We listened.
[01:20:16.385 --> 01:20:19.428]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:20:19.428 --> 01:20:20.048]  We're good to go.
[01:20:46.270 --> 01:20:50.272]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:20:50.733 --> 01:20:53.434]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:54.675 --> 01:20:58.337]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:20:58.757 --> 01:21:04.180]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:09.743]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:21:10.443 --> 01:21:23.769]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:29.572]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:21:29.852 --> 01:21:35.675]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:21:36.495 --> 01:21:38.296]  Call for your free copy at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:39.357 --> 01:21:42.519]  When investing, always proceed with caution.
[01:21:42.959 --> 01:21:43.559]  Again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:43.619 --> 01:21:45.780]  Exercise your legal right to trade metals privately.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:45.860]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.503 --> 01:21:57.546]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[01:21:57.786 --> 01:21:59.588]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[01:21:59.788 --> 01:22:03.431]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[01:22:03.731 --> 01:22:09.596]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[01:22:09.717 --> 01:22:15.722]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[01:22:16.002 --> 01:22:19.684]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.
[01:22:19.864 --> 01:22:24.686]  All-natural Gano Café tastes great and is a drug-free alternative for optimal health and longevity.
[01:22:24.826 --> 01:22:29.848]  With several delicious varieties, including mocha, hot cocoa, and the Brazilian coffee classic.
[01:22:30.008 --> 01:22:32.390]  You can experience Gano Café for yourself.
[01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:35.511]  Find out what people around the world are drinking for energy.
[01:22:35.791 --> 01:22:38.993]  And to meet the demands of a busy day, the natural and healthy way.
[01:22:39.173 --> 01:22:40.614]  Try Gano Cafe today.

[01:22:54.203 --> 01:22:56.944]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:57.505 --> 01:23:00.807]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.563 --> 01:23:08.532]  We got Larry Pratt coming on in the next hour to talk about all the house-to-house confiscations and things that are happening.
[01:23:09.533 --> 01:23:10.535]  Chairman of the GOA.
[01:23:12.518 --> 01:23:18.927]  And we're joined now for this short segment and a little bit of the next segment by Member of Parliament George Galloway, who we're so honored to have.
[01:23:19.699 --> 01:23:22.400]  Mr. Galloway goes to Washington.com as the website.
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:24.361]  We'll get a link to that up on InfoWars.com.
[01:23:24.761 --> 01:23:36.847]  Starting in Boston, coming up on Tuesday the 13th of September, and then ending in the big anti-war rally, pro-peace rally, pro-America rally, pro-freedom rally that's going to be going on in DC on the 24th.
[01:23:36.907 --> 01:23:38.528]  And I'm tempted to try to go to that.
[01:23:39.068 --> 01:23:40.389]  Either going to go there or to New Orleans.
[01:23:40.529 --> 01:23:41.930]  I may have to try to get into New Orleans.
[01:23:41.970 --> 01:23:43.050]  This is just out of control.
[01:23:45.864 --> 01:23:59.750]  Mr. Galloway, continuing, last time you were on with us, last time you were on with us, at the very end of the interview, you were saying, I don't think they can invade Iran right now because public support isn't behind it.
[01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:00.991]  They certainly want to.
[01:24:01.031 --> 01:24:03.051]  And I said, well, what if there's a terror attack?
[01:24:03.432 --> 01:24:06.293]  What if the military industrial complex or one of their contractors
[01:24:06.993 --> 01:24:09.435]  Uh, engineers one and blames it on Iran.
[01:24:09.735 --> 01:24:13.677]  And you said that is a real threat, that is exactly the type of thing these monkeys will do.
[01:24:14.077 --> 01:24:17.079]  We've gotta keep an eye on them and an eternal vigilance.
[01:24:17.499 --> 01:24:19.621]  To paraphrase, you've actually got the clip we can play.
[01:24:19.641 --> 01:24:22.222]  Uh, would you like to elaborate on that?
[01:24:22.242 --> 01:24:28.446]  Would you like to elaborate, uh, on Blair's seizing on the tragic bombings in London and then now how that's backfired?
[01:24:28.466 --> 01:24:30.207]  Would you comment on that for us, please?
[01:24:30.247 --> 01:24:35.010]  There's a very real danger because you have elements within the state, you have the Richard Pell
[01:24:35.929 --> 01:25:02.644]  Access of evil, snarling, you're next at this country or that country and yet the circumstances on the ground, the political collapse of the Bushites in the United States, the resistance in Iraq having taken such a terrible toll on the occupation armies and the collaborators in the puppet regime, making the idea of another war simply ridiculous.
[01:25:03.497 --> 01:25:10.982]  On the face of it, the idea of invading another country when you haven't even swallowed the country you just invaded is preposterous.
[01:25:11.022 --> 01:25:27.032]  And yet there are those in this neocon, Zionist, Christian fundamentalist axis that really is itching to get as much of these things done, as much of this agenda pushed on, while they still have the reins of power.
[01:25:27.673 --> 01:25:29.774]  And so you cannot discount
[01:25:30.679 --> 01:25:40.466]  Some kind of provocation being staged by those elements who want to propel the United States into an even more disastrous invasion.
[01:25:40.887 --> 01:25:41.907]  But I can tell you something.
[01:25:41.947 --> 01:25:56.418]  I was recently in Lebanon where the Bush administration is currently demanding the disarming of the National Resistance Movement, Hezbollah, which drove Israel out of Lebanon after 28 years of occupation.
[01:25:57.178 --> 01:25:59.820]  The United States demands that they get disarmed.
[01:26:00.484 --> 01:26:05.348]  The journalist there asked me, do you think Mr. Bush will send the U.S.
[01:26:05.408 --> 01:26:08.210]  Marines to Lebanon to disarm the Hezbollah?
[01:26:08.831 --> 01:26:16.036]  And I laughed, and she laughed, because it's simply ridiculous, the idea that the United States could do that.
[01:26:16.637 --> 01:26:22.181]  And yet there are elements within the United States administration and around it who would very much like to do that.
[01:26:22.876 --> 01:26:26.018]  So, you cannot discount the possibility of a provocation.
[01:26:26.058 --> 01:26:31.742]  You cannot discount the possibility of some new canard being dragged into this.
[01:26:32.923 --> 01:26:40.328]  Some scare about Iran's intentions or its capabilities propelling some kind of action.
[01:26:41.169 --> 01:26:46.132]  But perhaps it would be Israel that they would use as the hammer in such a scenario.
[01:26:46.192 --> 01:26:51.416]  And then if Iran responded against Israel, then perhaps the United States would be dragged in.
[01:26:52.074 --> 01:26:54.275]  And then Iran would respond in the south of Iraq.
[01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:56.637]  And then the whole balloon would go up, believe me.
[01:26:57.577 --> 01:27:00.419]  We're talking about World War III.
[01:27:00.459 --> 01:27:02.660]  Yes, we're talking about war throughout the world.
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:03.641]  War of the worlds.
[01:27:04.301 --> 01:27:05.542]  And, you know, H.G.
[01:27:05.562 --> 01:27:07.343]  Wells couldn't have made it up.
[01:27:08.023 --> 01:27:12.026]  And we have to refuse to go into this good night.
[01:27:12.566 --> 01:27:16.288]  Because it will mean the destruction of life as we know it on this planet.
[01:27:16.348 --> 01:27:20.991]  Our children will never be able to travel outside the limits of our own borders again.
[01:27:21.670 --> 01:27:23.732]  Even inside our own borders, they'll be in danger.
[01:27:24.412 --> 01:27:33.620]  And, oh, but that'll give the military-industrial complex an excuse to set up a big police state domestically and arrest people they don't like if they can start World War III.
[01:27:34.060 --> 01:27:34.661]  Well, that's right.
[01:27:34.781 --> 01:27:36.682]  It's Orwellian.
[01:27:36.722 --> 01:27:37.303]  It's 1984.
[01:27:37.563 --> 01:27:47.091]  It's the permanent division of the world into warring blocs for the profit of a few and at the cost of the misery of the many.
[01:27:47.691 --> 01:27:49.373]  And we have to refuse this.
[01:27:49.949 --> 01:27:57.535]  And we have to refuse it in every way we can, by political pressure, by civic pressure, by demonstrations like the one in D.C.
[01:27:57.575 --> 01:27:58.396]  on the 24th.
[01:27:58.596 --> 01:28:09.164]  Mr. Galloway, to be specific though, it's even been in the Jerusalem Post, it's been in major publications that Israel created fake Al-Qaeda groups and actually had them carry out bombings three years ago.
[01:28:09.344 --> 01:28:10.265]  I'm talking about that!
[01:28:11.125 --> 01:28:15.849]  Well, there is no doubt that Israel and dirty tricks have a long history.
[01:28:16.346 --> 01:28:40.660]  Indeed, many of the provocations which drove Jewish people in the Arab world, for example, out of the countries in which they had been living happily for hundreds of years, having gone to those Arab countries to seek protection from Christian countries in Europe, like Spain and Portugal, the provocations turned out to have been organized by the Israeli Secret Services.
[01:28:40.980 --> 01:28:42.081]  Stay there, sir, we got a break.
[01:28:43.947 --> 01:28:44.868]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.348 --> 01:28:46.970]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.870 --> 01:28:50.652]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.415 --> 01:29:00.180]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo is coming to Mystic Lake Casino Hotel September 19th and 20th.
[01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:02.982]  Store prizes, free drawings, and non-stop fun.
[01:29:03.222 --> 01:29:04.043]  Featuring the Ms.
[01:29:04.063 --> 01:29:12.249]  Minnesota Senior Pageant, Dr. Dale Anderson, who prescribes laughter for help, the Plymouth Playhouse Church Basement Ladies, the Silver Sneakers, and more.
[01:29:12.669 --> 01:29:17.013]  Learn all about the new Medicare prescription plan from the Social Security Administration.
[01:29:17.033 --> 01:29:18.193]  See a fashion show.
[01:29:18.474 --> 01:29:21.056]  Have fun with the bees and Mariner and the Magic Man.
[01:29:21.276 --> 01:29:22.817]  There's something new every hour.
[01:29:22.837 --> 01:29:26.420]  All this, plus hundreds of products, drawings, and fantastic giveaways.
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:30.523]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo celebrates all that's good about getting older.
[01:29:30.823 --> 01:29:33.665]  It's all happening at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.
[01:29:35.066 --> 01:29:39.492]  For discount tickets visit 101expos.com or call 612-798-7256.
[01:29:39.732 --> 01:29:48.583]  Sponsored in part by Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, KSTC, KSTP, Medica, and Ebenezer.
[01:29:48.844 --> 01:29:51.968]  Save the date September 19th and 20th at Mystic Lake.
[01:29:53.419 --> 01:29:55.400]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:06.205]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.565 --> 01:30:11.087]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.147 --> 01:30:22.493]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.073 --> 01:30:29.935]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.315 --> 01:30:32.456]  Your purified water is now ready!
[01:30:32.956 --> 01:30:37.917]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 hose filter elements.
[01:30:38.237 --> 01:30:44.299]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at
[01:30:45.239 --> 01:30:45.299]  803-4438.
[01:30:45.359 --> 01:30:48.784]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:49.024 --> 01:30:49.765]  That's toll free.
[01:30:49.785 --> 01:30:49.825]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.352 --> 01:31:00.716]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.916 --> 01:31:05.918]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:06.259 --> 01:31:14.163]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:14.323 --> 01:31:21.367]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:21.587 --> 01:31:22.788]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:22.928 --> 01:31:26.330]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:26.390 --> 01:31:27.510]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:27.791 --> 01:31:29.071]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:31:29.272 --> 01:31:36.116]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:36.216 --> 01:31:38.657]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:38.817 --> 01:31:41.780]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:41.840]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.860 --> 01:31:42.821]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:59.986 --> 01:32:03.008]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[01:32:03.588 --> 01:32:06.190]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[01:32:06.210 --> 01:32:09.572]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[01:32:09.793 --> 01:32:12.574]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[01:32:12.594 --> 01:32:15.036]  If you break the law, you'll hear from me.
[01:32:15.276 --> 01:32:17.478]  I know I'm the one in all the state.
[01:32:17.658 --> 01:32:18.899]  I'm the Highway Patrol.
[01:32:26.564 --> 01:32:28.665]  Meanwhile, the rest of the city is under water.
[01:32:28.685 --> 01:32:29.805]  No food or water for you.
[01:32:29.885 --> 01:32:31.026]  I mean, it's just insane.
[01:32:31.826 --> 01:32:34.447]  George Galloway, Member of Parliament, coming to the U.S.
[01:32:34.467 --> 01:32:35.188]  here very soon.
[01:32:36.048 --> 01:32:38.469]  The website for his trip to the U.S.
[01:32:38.509 --> 01:32:49.015]  in the next two weeks, he's arriving next Monday, speaking on Tuesday, is MrGallowayGoesToWashington.com and RespectCoalition.org is his political website.
[01:32:49.775 --> 01:32:53.537]  But he's just been very outspoken, really exposed the neocons for what they are.
[01:32:54.117 --> 01:32:58.724]  And folks, for those who don't know, this is like BBC, this is London Guardian, this is Haraj.
[01:32:59.485 --> 01:33:03.330]  And I know it's evil to say it's wrong to blow up synagogues, but...
[01:33:04.056 --> 01:33:04.877]  If Israel's doing it.
[01:33:04.897 --> 01:33:06.078]  If Israel's doing it, it's good.
[01:33:06.178 --> 01:33:07.839]  Well, no, it's not good if Israel's doing it.
[01:33:08.460 --> 01:33:12.203]  A group of sociopathic people who wanted to scare Jews into submission.
[01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:20.569]  But, George, I brought up government-sponsored terror to get us to go along with their aims, and you brought up the admitted historical evidences of what the Zionists did.
[01:33:20.609 --> 01:33:21.690]  Why don't you please continue, sir?
[01:33:21.910 --> 01:33:24.813]  Well, the Zionist movement were the past masters of this.
[01:33:24.953 --> 01:33:28.836]  They created the conditions in the Arab countries
[01:33:29.276 --> 01:33:57.027]  and in some European countries to stampede Jewish people out of the countries that they've been living in for many hundreds of years and stampede them into the Zionist state in places like Morocco and other North African countries where Jewish people had fled to avoid Christian persecution from Europe and where people had looked after them and they were an integral part of the community suddenly saw their synagogues blowing up, their property being damaged and provocations of all kinds being staged
[01:33:57.821 --> 01:34:03.405]  And they packed their bags and moved to occupied Palestine, then to be called Israel.
[01:34:03.825 --> 01:34:10.090]  And anyone who's read Graham Greene's Quiet American, or seen the movie with Michael Caine,
[01:34:10.789 --> 01:34:18.016]  See, can see the provocation staged by the early United States dirty tricks operation in Occupied Vietnam.
[01:34:18.237 --> 01:34:21.900]  Yeah, that's based on true stories put to personal account.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:24.543]  Absolutely, historical fact.
[01:34:24.683 --> 01:34:27.346]  Blowing up women and children, blaming it on their enemies.
[01:34:27.706 --> 01:34:30.848]  And we have Operation Northwoods calling for this, the U.S.
[01:34:30.868 --> 01:34:31.589]  government plan.
[01:34:32.129 --> 01:34:33.050]  We now have the U.S.'
[01:34:33.030 --> 01:34:33.550]  's Liberty.
[01:34:33.810 --> 01:34:35.091]  I've had the admirals on.
[01:34:35.411 --> 01:34:40.255]  LBJ got on the phone and said, I want that GD boat going to the bottom to blame it on Egypt.
[01:34:40.315 --> 01:34:41.075]  Israel and the U.S.
[01:34:41.135 --> 01:34:43.457]  teamed up together to basically sink their own ship.
[01:34:44.037 --> 01:34:47.980]  We know about just countless examples of this, George.
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:48.740]  Please continue.
[01:34:49.040 --> 01:34:50.141]  Absolutely.
[01:34:50.321 --> 01:34:55.565]  And it's always the case that in a big and complex state machine,
[01:34:56.085 --> 01:34:57.287]  There are all sorts of elements.
[01:34:57.307 --> 01:35:01.331]  They don't have to be endorsed by the political leadership or all of the political leadership.
[01:35:01.772 --> 01:35:05.136]  They can be people representing a trend in the political leadership.
[01:35:05.556 --> 01:35:10.823]  I've already mentioned this hideous character, Richard Pell, earlier.
[01:35:11.483 --> 01:35:13.526]  I saw him just the other day on a website.
[01:35:14.006 --> 01:35:15.909]  Actually, snarling, you're next!
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:20.923]  Threatening people with American military power.
[01:35:21.424 --> 01:35:27.590]  A man who couldn't punch his own way out of a wet paper bag, but ready to fight to the last drop of other people's blood.
[01:35:28.231 --> 01:35:32.215]  And these people make my blood boil, and they ought to make every right-thinking person.
[01:35:32.655 --> 01:35:33.635]  I feel that way.
[01:35:33.835 --> 01:35:36.276]  We deserve better than to be governed by these gangsters.
[01:35:36.316 --> 01:35:40.917]  Well, Member of Parliament George Galloway, you are such a... I mean, you're absolutely right.
[01:35:40.957 --> 01:35:41.817]  That's my feeling.
[01:35:42.157 --> 01:35:49.879]  I mean, if somebody themselves has been in combat, is somewhat of a hero, a tough guy, it's still disgusting to see them bully.
[01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:56.020]  But when some little fat, oily, weak, toad-like piece of trash
[01:35:56.440 --> 01:36:00.701]  Constantly going around snarling, bragging about killing hundreds of thousands.
[01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:02.922]  I mean, that guy is a puss ball.
[01:36:03.402 --> 01:36:09.304]  He's chicken hawks, and I'm afraid that George Bush has to be numbered amongst them.
[01:36:10.384 --> 01:36:22.948]  People who did their absolute utmost to avoid their military duty used the power and wealth of their family upbringing to get out of the things that they were happy for others to have to go into.
[01:36:23.568 --> 01:36:38.177]  It's very, very hard to swallow when they're swaggering around in their bomber jackets, kicking ass, metaphorically speaking, or rather sending other mothers' sons to kick ass or have their own asses kicked.
[01:36:38.637 --> 01:36:40.758]  And of course, it's not your ass that gets kicked.
[01:36:41.098 --> 01:36:47.622]  It's your head that gets blown open by a roadside bomb or by a sniper's bullet or by a suicide bomber.
[01:36:48.062 --> 01:36:50.944]  And it's an absolute sickening scandal
[01:36:51.403 --> 01:36:56.065]  That now almost 2,000, I think probably 2,000 by the time I get there.
[01:36:56.185 --> 01:36:57.246]  Well, I mean, 100 years ago!
[01:36:57.266 --> 01:36:59.767]  Young American boys have paid with their lives for all of this!
[01:36:59.887 --> 01:37:01.988]  Well, exactly, but I mean, if...
[01:37:03.320 --> 01:37:11.504]  I mean, a hundred years ago, eighty years ago, I mean, if the British Crown wanted to go to war, the princelings had to be up front, and they got shot.
[01:37:11.764 --> 01:37:12.464]  They got killed.
[01:37:12.804 --> 01:37:14.505]  I mean, that's always been the way it is.
[01:37:14.545 --> 01:37:15.666]  People go, we're going to war.
[01:37:15.706 --> 01:37:16.486]  Your kids are going.
[01:37:16.506 --> 01:37:17.607]  That doesn't happen anymore.
[01:37:17.627 --> 01:37:19.728]  I mean, this is a new type of corruption.
[01:37:20.128 --> 01:37:20.608]  Yes, it is.
[01:37:20.888 --> 01:37:28.912]  And I vividly recall in Fahrenheit 9-11, Michael Moore going around asking senators if they'd like to send their sons to Iraq.
[01:37:29.392 --> 01:37:31.433]  And the look on the faces of the senators
[01:37:32.103 --> 01:37:37.451]  Made it clear that just literally nothing in the world would have persuaded them to do that.
[01:37:37.851 --> 01:37:41.456]  Nothing could have been further from their mind that their own sons would go there.
[01:37:41.966 --> 01:37:56.833]  But the sons of others, usually poor white people, usually poor black people, poor hispanic people, they're the ones that go to the front line and they pay the blood price for these fantasies of power.
[01:37:57.093 --> 01:38:00.395]  And then Bush gets this weird type of reflected glory off of them.
[01:38:00.795 --> 01:38:03.597]  Or reflected glory off firefighters on 9-11.
[01:38:03.637 --> 01:38:04.417]  It's disgusting.
[01:38:04.897 --> 01:38:05.217]  It is.
[01:38:05.738 --> 01:38:06.258]  It really is.
[01:38:06.318 --> 01:38:08.219]  And he's the same man who's cutting budgets.
[01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:25.314]  For the very same fire departments, the very same emergency response departments, cutting the budget so he can cut the taxes for rich people, so he can ship the United States taxpayers' dollars out to occupy other people's countries for the benefit of a few corporations and the military-industrial complex.
[01:38:25.374 --> 01:38:36.543]  Well, by the way, George Galloway, as you know, Member of Parliament, over here he has slashed the veterans' funding, and people who die, I mean, a month ago I talked to a Marine's wife,
[01:38:37.363 --> 01:38:40.884]  He died and now they got a little $10,000 check.
[01:38:40.964 --> 01:38:41.424]  That's it.
[01:38:41.824 --> 01:38:44.205]  No pension, nothing for their child.
[01:38:44.445 --> 01:38:47.126]  The child, the family doesn't get the GI Bill.
[01:38:47.666 --> 01:38:48.686]  It is disgusting.
[01:38:48.786 --> 01:38:49.166]  Nothing.
[01:38:49.226 --> 01:38:49.987]  They get nothing.
[01:38:50.527 --> 01:38:55.568]  I'll never forget in that wonderful movie, I came to know Ron Kovacs on whom the film was based.
[01:38:56.908 --> 01:38:58.069]  Born on the 4th of July.
[01:38:58.089 --> 01:39:06.231]  That shit hospital that Tom Cruise ends up in after he's given his limbs for his country in the Vietnam War.
[01:39:07.104 --> 01:39:12.130]  And the sink hospital that they put him in, and the way in which he was treated.
[01:39:12.450 --> 01:39:15.773]  This is the way these people treat those that they send into battle for them.
[01:39:16.134 --> 01:39:25.343]  They tell them a pack of lies, they fire them up with hatred of Johnny Foreigner, and then if it goes wrong, then none of the blood spatters upon them.
[01:39:26.172 --> 01:39:27.294]  And we've got to change that.
[01:39:27.814 --> 01:39:32.543]  We have democratic power that we have to organize ourselves into using.
[01:39:33.004 --> 01:39:37.612]  And a good, can-do country like the United States ought to be able to show the world the way in this.
[01:39:38.246 --> 01:39:44.669]  Well, George Galloway, I've just got one or two questions left for you and then we're going to let you go because I know you're a very, very busy man.
[01:39:45.370 --> 01:40:06.120]  All I can say is that this is so groundbreaking to have you with your incredible record and your impeccable record of standing up against corruption and as a journalist, as a reporter in your background, to sit here and to talk about governments creating terrorist attacks, creating crises, to blame it on their enemies.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:07.661]  You mentioned the Zionists.
[01:40:08.453 --> 01:40:14.957]  The Zionists is now coming out, even in a lot of major publications, what we already knew, actually early on funded Hitler.
[01:40:15.277 --> 01:40:20.420]  They said he's going to be good, he's going to persecute Jews, and he likes our plan of Palestine.
[01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:26.663]  I mean, I'm sorry folks, funding Hitler and helping Hitler kill Jews is not pro-Jew.
[01:40:28.164 --> 01:40:30.546]  This is the thing about Zionism.
[01:40:30.726 --> 01:40:32.627]  It has nothing to do with Jewishness.
[01:40:33.147 --> 01:40:36.129]  Some of the biggest Zionists in the world are not Jews.
[01:40:36.610 --> 01:40:40.773]  Anybody who thinks George Bush likes Jews has never been to his golf club.
[01:40:41.673 --> 01:40:57.365]  The reality is these people have used Jewish people and they have used them with this ideology of Zionism to create this little settler state on the Mediterranean to act as an advance guard for their own interests in the Arab world.
[01:40:57.899 --> 01:40:59.220]  And we're all paying for it.
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:00.580]  The Palestinians have paid for it.
[01:41:00.620 --> 01:41:01.781]  The Arabs are paying for it.
[01:41:02.181 --> 01:41:05.462]  And now the American people and the rest of the people in the world are paying for it.
[01:41:05.802 --> 01:41:06.563]  And why should we?
[01:41:07.023 --> 01:41:12.545]  We don't want to live our lives in a state of permanent warfare and division.
[01:41:12.565 --> 01:41:13.506]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:41:15.137 --> 01:41:20.219]  When you go to Iraq, when you go to Egypt, when you go to these countries, I mean, I've talked to a lot of reporters that have been there.
[01:41:20.239 --> 01:41:26.881]  A lot of them say that the Arabs are pretty nice folks on average, and they are sophisticated.
[01:41:27.181 --> 01:41:30.882]  They know the American and British people are not evil like our governments.
[01:41:30.902 --> 01:41:31.542]  Do you agree with that?
[01:41:32.002 --> 01:41:36.664]  Well, they do, but they also have a point which is difficult for us to get out of, Alex.
[01:41:37.784 --> 01:41:43.506]  We have democratic countries, systems, and our governments are chosen by us.
[01:41:44.375 --> 01:41:53.045]  And therefore we cannot escape the share of the responsibility for what our governments do, I'm afraid, in the way that a dictatorship can do.
[01:41:53.085 --> 01:42:02.034]  You see, if you're living in a dictatorship and your dictator decides to launch war on someone else, then no one can realistically blame you in any way for that.
[01:42:02.555 --> 01:42:05.478]  But if you live in a democracy and you keep re-electing a government,
[01:42:05.819 --> 01:42:15.466]  That keeps launching wars against other people on bogus pretexts, on a pack of lies with devastating consequences, then I'm afraid we must take some of the responsibility.
[01:42:15.486 --> 01:42:19.329]  That's why we've called this tour that I'm on, Stand Up and Be Counted.
[01:42:19.749 --> 01:42:22.551]  This is my Stand Up and Be Counted tour of the United States.
[01:42:22.924 --> 01:42:36.837]  And I hope it will catch on and that people will be standing up and be counted all over this great land of yours, so that the people of the world can see that these neocons are not acting in the name of all Americans.
[01:42:37.478 --> 01:42:41.842]  Well, look, I mean, the polls show that, but I mean, George, again, I go back to the fact that
[01:42:42.483 --> 01:42:44.124]  They select both candidates.
[01:42:44.184 --> 01:42:45.445]  They put them in front of us.
[01:42:45.505 --> 01:42:49.128]  I think in many cases, we have a manufactured political process.
[01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:52.171]  I don't think, at many levels, it is legitimate now.
[01:42:52.211 --> 01:42:58.356]  We need to reform it and get back to our republic, a constitutional form of government, to do that.
[01:42:58.456 --> 01:43:05.801]  I mean, I think with your parliamentary system, you've got a little bit better chance of somehow maneuvering in and stopping the Tories in labor.
[01:43:05.842 --> 01:43:06.642]  But it's the same here.
[01:43:06.682 --> 01:43:08.604]  I mean, Hillary Clinton's for the war.
[01:43:08.684 --> 01:43:09.885]  Chuckie Schumer's for the war.
[01:43:10.665 --> 01:43:19.192]  Yes, I mean, there's no doubt that there's a dilemma, but the United States is a country that was built out of nothing, and built itself all the way to the moon and the stars.
[01:43:19.732 --> 01:43:31.681]  The United States, the people of the United States, are great, can-do people, and they ought to be able to use the Constitution, which the founding fathers gave them, to organize their political power to change things.
[01:43:31.761 --> 01:43:33.763]  I don't believe that that's beyond... No, I agree with you.
[01:43:33.823 --> 01:43:36.745]  I think we have the power, we've just got to, you know, assess this
[01:43:37.385 --> 01:43:38.566]  This enemy system.
[01:43:38.606 --> 01:43:39.987]  In closing, you said 2,000 troops.
[01:43:40.147 --> 01:43:47.271]  I mean, obviously you know that they don't count them as combat dead if they die on the plane out of the country or if they die in Rammstein.
[01:43:47.511 --> 01:43:49.332]  And the real numbers are around 8,000 U.S.
[01:43:49.752 --> 01:43:50.532]  dead, George.
[01:43:50.852 --> 01:43:52.193]  Well, I don't know how big they are.
[01:43:52.313 --> 01:44:04.840]  I'm certainly prepared to accept that there are more than the 2,000 that we know about because there are these green card soldiers that don't appear to get counted and there are people who are dying of their wounds later that don't appear in the statistics.
[01:44:05.387 --> 01:44:11.133]  And of course, there's the more than 100,000 Iraqis who have been slaughtered, whom they haven't even counted.
[01:44:11.553 --> 01:44:18.499]  But according to the Johns Hopkins University and the Lancet, that figure is now well in excess of 100,000 people.
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:22.063]  And they don't, I think, include these so-called contractors.
[01:44:22.563 --> 01:44:30.127]  Who are in many cases merely mercenaries to whom military duties have been subcontracted out.
[01:44:30.447 --> 01:44:32.948]  600 of those have died in Afghanistan and Iraq now.
[01:44:33.829 --> 01:44:38.511]  Well in Basra in the last few days, which is supposedly the quiet part of the country,
[01:44:39.031 --> 01:44:47.195]  Two British soldiers, six American contractors, and at least 36 Iraqis have been killed just in the last 48, uh, 56 hours.
[01:44:47.275 --> 01:44:50.336]  Well, I know you've got to go, but this... It's happening now every day.
[01:44:50.616 --> 01:44:52.297]  I know you've got to go, but this is the last question.
[01:44:52.577 --> 01:44:52.797]  Okay.
[01:44:53.097 --> 01:44:56.339]  They came up with a P-2-O-G plan right before they invaded.
[01:44:56.379 --> 01:45:03.182]  You can just type in P-2, just the letter P-2-O-G, and you'll get, uh, UPI and AP on this.
[01:45:03.462 --> 01:45:03.723]  Uh-huh.
[01:45:16.818 --> 01:45:44.249]  They said by basically turning everybody against each other we'll make sure that country never gets strong again and so and then there was an Israeli plan actually written up in 1987 that was in the Jerusalem Post a few months ago and in this plan written up they called for using America and for the exact same thing dividing it up in about four different groups fighting with each other so people think we're failing in a way but cynically Bush and his crew want things to be bedlam.
[01:45:44.429 --> 01:45:46.470]  Now I think it's more bedlam than they wanted
[01:45:49.072 --> 01:45:59.742]  Well, as a British person coming from a country with a very long imperial heritage, I know that divide and rule is the first weapon of all empires.
[01:46:00.142 --> 01:46:04.706]  And the purpose of empires, I remind your listeners, is to go abroad and steal other people's things.
[01:46:05.206 --> 01:46:06.808]  That's why the British Empire
[01:46:07.467 --> 01:46:15.294]  Uh, cast its, uh, shadow around the whole of the world in an empire so vast that on it the sun never set.
[01:46:15.395 --> 01:46:19.638]  But as my Irish grandfather used to say, that's because God would never trust the British in the dark.
[01:46:20.139 --> 01:46:22.341]  So the, uh... My dad always says that.
[01:46:22.361 --> 01:46:22.921]  That's funny.
[01:46:23.322 --> 01:46:26.845]  And it's, uh, it's never been truer today.
[01:46:27.546 --> 01:46:32.010]  But the reality is, if that was their plan, it isn't working.
[01:46:32.530 --> 01:46:34.831]  Because it's spiraling now out of control.
[01:46:35.191 --> 01:46:37.151]  You must be careful what you wish for in life.
[01:46:37.671 --> 01:46:52.554]  And to wish for a Yugoslavia on top of the world's biggest oil field in the Arabian Gulf, where countries all around are divided between Sunni and Shia, would be a catastrophic end to what has been a disaster so far.
[01:46:53.174 --> 01:46:57.135]  And I think that the Iraqis are sensible enough
[01:46:57.645 --> 01:47:00.709]  To do everything that they can to avoid that catastrophe.
[01:47:01.110 --> 01:47:05.857]  I don't believe they will allow themselves to be divided to the point of breaking up the country.
[01:47:06.217 --> 01:47:10.824]  But if we do end up with a Balkanized, a Yugoslavized, a Lebanized,
[01:47:11.380 --> 01:47:14.862]  Iraq, then believe me, we'll all pay a price for it for a hundred years.
[01:47:15.363 --> 01:47:16.263]  But the elite won't.
[01:47:17.164 --> 01:47:17.824]  They'll just love it.
[01:47:17.844 --> 01:47:22.807]  Well, George Galloway, you're coming to town for the next two weeks, starting next Tuesday in Boston.
[01:47:23.228 --> 01:47:27.190]  Folks can find out more there on the website MrGallowayComesToWashington.com.
[01:47:27.550 --> 01:47:32.133]  I want to thank you so much, and I'd like to get you on a few times a year here on the broadcast.
[01:47:32.153 --> 01:47:32.533]  I'd love to.
[01:47:33.214 --> 01:47:36.496]  And we'd love to get you to come down here to Austin, so God bless you.
[01:47:36.696 --> 01:47:39.479]  Alex, my book is out now in conjunction with the tour.
[01:47:39.519 --> 01:47:43.882]  It's called Mr. Galloway Goes to Washington and it's published by New Press.
[01:47:44.383 --> 01:47:46.905]  So that'll be in the bookshops in the next day or two.
[01:47:46.965 --> 01:47:48.126]  I hope your listeners will pick it up.
[01:47:48.246 --> 01:47:50.248]  So that's going to be here in the U.S.?
[01:47:50.328 --> 01:47:51.209]  Yes, it's a U.S.
[01:47:51.249 --> 01:47:53.311]  book and it's called Mr. Galloway Goes to Washington.
[01:47:53.531 --> 01:47:57.835]  Mr. Galloway Goes to Washington and that's published by who?
[01:47:57.855 --> 01:47:58.816]  Published by New Press.
[01:47:59.016 --> 01:47:59.316]  All right.
[01:47:59.596 --> 01:48:00.157]  Thank you, sir.
[01:48:00.537 --> 01:48:00.958]  All the best.
[01:48:01.118 --> 01:48:01.718]  Take care.
[01:48:02.179 --> 01:48:02.399]  You bet.
[01:48:03.466 --> 01:48:05.587]  And again, folks, I apologize.
[01:48:05.607 --> 01:48:09.148]  They have different rules over in England, and that's just the King's English.
[01:48:09.408 --> 01:48:10.709]  It's not the King's English.
[01:48:11.069 --> 01:48:13.910]  That earlier little comment, they used that on the nightly news over there.
[01:48:14.610 --> 01:48:17.591]  He's a distinguished member of Parliament, and we really appreciate him coming on.
[01:48:18.312 --> 01:48:21.113]  And that is not a limp-wristed liberal that you just heard.
[01:48:21.133 --> 01:48:25.934]  And I know that Mr. Galloway is not anti-gun, and he's not, you know, a lot of things that we think are good.
[01:48:26.315 --> 01:48:32.377]  He's also a little bit socialist when it comes to some of his economic policies, but regardless, folks,
[01:48:33.902 --> 01:48:34.942]  He's speaking the truth.
[01:48:34.982 --> 01:48:36.563]  He's exposing the New World Order.
[01:48:37.304 --> 01:48:41.226]  And by interfacing with these folks, we're waking a lot of them up.
[01:48:41.766 --> 01:48:46.729]  And so there's a Member of Parliament saying our government's carrying out terror is a real threat.
[01:48:47.670 --> 01:48:49.991]  We had a nice little discussion off-air about the London bombing.
[01:48:50.749 --> 01:48:52.290]  And we see eye to eye on that.
[01:48:53.351 --> 01:48:55.152]  So, amazing interview.
[01:48:55.192 --> 01:48:56.734]  Now, when we get back, I will go to your calls.
[01:48:56.774 --> 01:49:01.097]  We'll take calls until Ron and Steve and David and Patrick and James have been holding for a while.
[01:49:01.497 --> 01:49:04.840]  In the next ten minutes, we'll take your calls quickly.
[01:49:04.900 --> 01:49:06.181]  And we've got Larry Pratt coming on.
[01:49:06.521 --> 01:49:07.442]  Gun confiscation.
[01:49:07.462 --> 01:49:08.462]  Doors being kicked down.
[01:49:08.522 --> 01:49:09.883]  Does nothing to keep people safe.
[01:49:11.505 --> 01:49:12.746]  It's just totally evil.
[01:49:12.826 --> 01:49:14.127]  Middle class homes being raided.
[01:49:14.167 --> 01:49:17.109]  The police absolutely just loving every minute of it.
[01:49:17.769 --> 01:49:19.331]  And, uh, I mean, I've watched them on the news.
[01:49:19.351 --> 01:49:20.292]  They're getting off on it.
[01:49:20.332 --> 01:49:21.092]  They've trained for this.
[01:49:21.933 --> 01:49:23.434]  When they get your guns, folks, it's over.
[01:49:23.474 --> 01:49:23.935]  We're slaves.
[01:49:24.876 --> 01:49:28.098]  And, uh, that's their number one goal, their one burning desire.
[01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:44.413]  That's their secret desire, the thing they roll around at night in the bed, just in the covers, just gleefully worshipping the day they get our guns so they can really enslave us and really crack skulls and really teach us how to be slaves.
[01:49:45.143 --> 01:49:46.944]  And, uh, Mexican troops armed in Texas.
[01:49:47.044 --> 01:49:49.625]  It is documented and, uh, we'll be right back.
[01:49:49.645 --> 01:49:50.025]  Stay with us.
[01:49:50.085 --> 01:50:01.668]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:06.670]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:06.890 --> 01:50:12.532]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:12.932 --> 01:50:13.492]  We're good to go.
[01:50:38.527 --> 01:50:38.787]  That's 888-253-3139
[01:50:53.451 --> 01:50:57.332]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.572 --> 01:51:03.013]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.293 --> 01:51:13.656]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:13.816 --> 01:51:18.137]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.357 --> 01:51:26.678]  Dry Halo Methane and volatile organic chemicals such as Atrazine, Benzene, Chlorine, Chloroform and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:26.978 --> 01:51:33.340]  They reduce Nitrate and unwanted metals such as Lead, Mercury, Aluminum, Copper and foul tastes like Chlorine and Sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:37.920]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:42.361]  Normally $48 each, get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:51:42.621 --> 01:51:47.022]  Get the powerful Black Berkey Replacement Filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:51:47.782 --> 01:51:48.102]  I think so.
[01:52:10.211 --> 01:52:10.812]  I think so.
[01:52:30.475 --> 01:52:30.876]  I think so.
[01:53:02.657 --> 01:53:04.779]  We're on your calls here momentarily.
[01:53:06.100 --> 01:53:22.417]  If you want to see the martial law, if you want to see the preparations for your gun confiscation, your enslavement, your family being broken up, in the crises the globalists are going to engineer and have engineered, you need to get martial law, 9-11, rise of the police state.
[01:53:23.343 --> 01:53:25.184]  Exposes their master plan with 8.09.11.
[01:53:25.624 --> 01:53:26.845]  How they control populations.
[01:53:26.865 --> 01:53:27.725]  You need to have this video.
[01:53:27.965 --> 01:53:28.846]  There's Road to Tyranny.
[01:53:28.866 --> 01:53:29.326]  Covers 9.11.
[01:53:29.706 --> 01:53:31.387]  Covers the urban warfare camps.
[01:53:31.947 --> 01:53:32.848]  The foreign troops.
[01:53:33.388 --> 01:53:33.988]  Police State 2000.
[01:53:34.348 --> 01:53:35.349]  Details and even more.
[01:53:36.764 --> 01:53:38.085]  Police take to the takeover.
[01:53:38.145 --> 01:53:39.146]  I mean, it's encyclopedic.
[01:53:39.466 --> 01:53:40.587]  You need to have these videos.
[01:53:40.627 --> 01:53:42.368]  I carry a bunch of other great videos and books.
[01:53:42.649 --> 01:53:48.813]  Just go to the Secure Online Shopping Carton Bookstore and Video Store at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:53:49.154 --> 01:53:52.396]  The best titles, bar none, to order via the Safe, Secure Shopping Cart.

[01:54:01.163 --> 01:54:02.444]  Every week, new information.
[01:54:03.024 --> 01:54:05.166]  You know, just thousands of pieces of media on there now.
[01:54:05.694 --> 01:54:06.597]  I don't know if that's true.
[01:54:07.139 --> 01:54:08.623]  Hundreds and hundreds of pieces of media.
[01:54:08.703 --> 01:54:09.085]  I don't know.
[01:54:10.088 --> 01:54:12.856]  There's hundreds and hundreds of audio interviews in there alone, so I guess...
[01:54:14.246 --> 01:54:16.007]  It's gotta be six hundred, seven hundred, I don't know.
[01:54:16.328 --> 01:54:19.330]  A lot of stuff on PrisonPlanet.tv in the year and a half we've had it up.
[01:54:19.870 --> 01:54:23.032]  PrisonPlanet.tv or call toll free to order any of the videos or books.
[01:54:23.753 --> 01:54:29.597]  One, and they can answer all your questions and tell you about specials, 1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:31.318 --> 01:54:36.682]  You've noticed during this disaster I've only been plugging the videos about once a day, so take advantage of this when I do plug it.
[01:54:37.182 --> 01:54:40.565]  Because I've just been so busy covering news I haven't been doing my hourly plug that
[01:54:41.135 --> 01:54:43.136]  Makes this broadcast possible.
[01:54:43.156 --> 01:54:45.277]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:45.317 --> 01:54:50.839]  Alright, Ron, you were holding earlier, you wanted to finish up.
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:52.960]  Go ahead and finish up what you had to say.
[01:54:53.220 --> 01:54:58.543]  This is Ron, retired police officer in New York, calling the police gun confiscating in New Orleans criminal.
[01:54:58.763 --> 01:55:00.884]  And again, Ron, it does nothing to keep anybody safe!
[01:55:01.324 --> 01:55:04.146]  The limited riots or looting is over.
[01:55:04.386 --> 01:55:07.767]  They're going to middle class, unflooded areas and robbing people.
[01:55:07.808 --> 01:55:08.188]  Go ahead.
[01:55:08.468 --> 01:55:14.511]  Well, you had good citizens and ironically when they had the looters looting in the city, they didn't take one step or measure against it.
[01:55:15.011 --> 01:55:19.073]  That's how you know this is a contrived action with another ulterior motive.
[01:55:19.153 --> 01:55:23.996]  And by the way, they're taking those guns and not invoicing and vouchering these lawfully possessed guns.
[01:55:24.036 --> 01:55:24.516]  They're gone.
[01:55:24.616 --> 01:55:26.617]  Their owners can come back and get them later.
[01:55:26.937 --> 01:55:28.478]  They're going to melt them into scrap metal.
[01:55:28.698 --> 01:55:39.403]  But then again, I'm sure the ultimate intent is to help, I guess, the Halliburton-Bush-Cheney cabal take the property through some kind of specious, illegal, eminent domain claim.
[01:55:39.443 --> 01:55:47.026]  Well, Halliburton already is the king of New Orleans, and it's admitted that backroom scams are already going for new hotels, everything.
[01:55:47.246 --> 01:55:50.948]  Alex, do you know that Halliburton, in the midst of the promotion within the first few days,
[01:55:51.548 --> 01:55:52.429]  We're good to go.
[01:56:09.781 --> 01:56:13.762]  Now again, everything Jim Tucker has gotten out of Bilderberg always comes true.
[01:56:13.802 --> 01:56:15.883]  A year before, he says the Berlin Wall is going to fall.
[01:56:16.203 --> 01:56:21.465]  He gives us the exact date a year before of the Iraq invasion, back when the media wasn't saying that was the date.
[01:56:21.765 --> 01:56:26.386]  He said oil was going to double because Kissinger was saying and rubbing his hands together.
[01:56:26.786 --> 01:56:30.828]  This is what our spies got us, and now, now look what's happening!
[01:56:31.288 --> 01:56:35.289]  Now, we're going into, in four to six weeks, the cold weather period in this country.
[01:56:35.869 --> 01:56:47.471]  If fuel to heat your home and operate your car as well, of course, goes up 71%, the American economy and the American people, I mean the people that are subject to these abuses, will not be able to bear that.
[01:56:47.991 --> 01:56:51.972]  My guess is that within six months their attempt is to collapse our economy.
[01:56:52.552 --> 01:57:02.494]  You know, I hope you're wrong, but notice the week before this New Orleans thing, the Fed chair came out and said, he used the word crash.
[01:57:03.479 --> 01:57:05.120]  So they're doing everything they can.
[01:57:05.140 --> 01:57:07.901]  If they wanted to stop a crash, folks, they'd say everything's fine.
[01:57:07.921 --> 01:57:09.702]  Keep your eyes open, because you know what?
[01:57:09.842 --> 01:57:11.983]  I don't think this is the last crisis we're going to be in.
[01:57:12.003 --> 01:57:14.845]  Hey, Ron, when the cops come to your house, are you going to give them your gun?
[01:57:15.845 --> 01:57:21.708]  Well, at that time, put it this way, they'll get a piece of my mind, that's for sure.
[01:57:21.908 --> 01:57:22.689]  That I will say.
[01:57:23.469 --> 01:57:24.810]  That's how I feel about it.
[01:57:24.830 --> 01:57:25.750]  Well, just give them your gun.
[01:57:25.790 --> 01:57:26.891]  That's what America's all about.
[01:57:27.211 --> 01:57:27.491]  Come on.
[01:57:28.712 --> 01:57:29.612]  Let them take your children.
[01:57:29.812 --> 01:57:30.252]  It's freedom.
[01:57:30.292 --> 01:57:31.373]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:33.783 --> 01:57:38.026]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.046 --> 01:57:38.506]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.526 --> 01:57:39.287]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.427 --> 01:57:41.048]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:47.352]  You want answers?
[01:57:48.152 --> 01:57:49.093]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.871 --> 01:58:01.578]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.059 --> 01:58:06.146]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.358 --> 01:58:11.619]  We're going to get into the mass gun confiscations.
[01:58:11.659 --> 01:58:17.643]  The Fed's seizing on the opportunity to set a precedent for all time to take law-abiding citizens' guns en masse.
[01:58:17.683 --> 01:58:19.544]  We always told you they would during a crisis.
[01:58:19.965 --> 01:58:23.647]  We always told you they'd tell you no food, no water, unless you give us the guns.
[01:58:24.027 --> 01:58:27.649]  And that's exactly what they're saying right now.
[01:58:27.669 --> 01:58:32.052]  I remember 10, 12 years ago hearing Mark Corgi on the air saying they're going to
[01:58:32.512 --> 01:58:34.893]  Create natural disasters, terror attacks.
[01:58:35.373 --> 01:58:40.634]  They're going to not let you have your food and water unless you give them your guns.
[01:58:40.874 --> 01:58:42.115]  They're going to break up families.
[01:58:42.515 --> 01:58:45.036]  And folks, I've been to the Urban Warfare Trainings real since.
[01:58:45.196 --> 01:58:45.896]  I witnessed it.
[01:58:46.256 --> 01:58:47.796]  And now they're doing it.
[01:58:48.236 --> 01:58:49.917]  And they love it.
[01:58:51.044 --> 01:58:52.185]  We got Larry Pratt coming up.
[01:58:52.205 --> 01:58:57.849]  We'll take some of your calls right now and calls early in this interview with Larry Pratt about the gun confiscations that are going on.
[01:58:58.309 --> 01:59:02.272]  Steve in Toronto or Stavos, excuse me, Stavos in Toronto, Canada.
[01:59:02.292 --> 01:59:03.293]  You're on the air, go ahead.
[01:59:03.773 --> 01:59:04.914]  Hi Alex, this is Stavos.
[01:59:05.094 --> 01:59:08.476]  I just wanted to call in some very interesting information I came across.
[01:59:09.137 --> 01:59:14.881]  It's from July 1977 National Geographic and it talks about Turkey.
[01:59:15.962 --> 01:59:18.944]  Now they have a map there on page 90 and it shows
[01:59:20.325 --> 01:59:33.256]  That one section of Turkey, the one that's publicly admitted, it's about the size of New York State, and it says that this area, this area of the Turkish government grows opium and sells it to the West.
[01:59:35.658 --> 01:59:44.685]  Well, of course, the government is openly... Listen, our government only sprays one-third of Colombia where cocaine is being grown because the FARC doesn't pay the cut.
[01:59:45.646 --> 01:59:47.968]  Our government openly grows the cocaine and heroin, sir.
[01:59:49.114 --> 01:59:52.857]  It's just out in the open in Afghanistan right now.
[01:59:53.877 --> 01:59:56.299]  More than a quadrupling of the supply since liberation.
[01:59:56.539 --> 01:59:58.560]  So your daughter can jam heroin in her arm.
[01:59:59.181 --> 02:00:03.183]  And then they'll raid your house looking for it.
[02:00:03.223 --> 02:00:05.865]  And then they'll put you in a private prison owned by the Bushes.
[02:00:05.885 --> 02:00:07.566]  They're one of the biggest donors of private prisons.
[02:00:08.026 --> 02:00:10.468]  It's just freedom, sir.
[02:00:11.252 --> 02:00:17.033]  Yes, but this thing goes all the way back to Rockefeller, back when they were setting up Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.
[02:00:17.413 --> 02:00:23.154]  Yeah, so why don't you photocopy those pages and the cover of that and mail it to me.
[02:00:23.214 --> 02:00:24.854]  I'll do it, no problem.
[02:00:24.874 --> 02:00:27.675]  I was aware of that, but I didn't know it was in National Geographic.
[02:00:28.175 --> 02:00:30.635]  We've got to grow this stuff so we can put people in prison.
[02:00:30.675 --> 02:00:31.476]  I mean, come on, man.
[02:00:32.136 --> 02:00:35.116]  Got to grow it to sell it to the troops so we can put them in prison.
[02:00:36.076 --> 02:00:37.437]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:00:37.537 --> 02:00:37.957]  One more thing.
[02:00:40.137 --> 02:00:55.430]  Friends down there in Mississippi, and they were telling me that, uh, you know, aside from all the other garbage that FEMA's doing that I heard on the radio show, they're also, you know, to add, you know, just more hell upon this hell, they're going and making fun of the people who are suffering.
[02:00:55.471 --> 02:01:07.121]  And get this, they were singing, the people from FEMA, FEMA troops, were singing, sitting on the dock of the bay, watching the niggers float away.
[02:01:07.734 --> 02:01:11.475]  And they would start laughing and antagonizing the people and provoking garbage.
[02:01:11.515 --> 02:01:12.095]  No, I know.
[02:01:12.155 --> 02:01:13.075]  I appreciate your call.
[02:01:13.115 --> 02:01:13.515]  No, I know.
[02:01:13.555 --> 02:01:14.435]  This is all confirmed.
[02:01:14.475 --> 02:01:15.335]  I was already aware of that.
[02:01:15.756 --> 02:01:17.336]  This is by design.
[02:01:17.936 --> 02:01:20.336]  Don't give them any food or water for four days.
[02:01:20.676 --> 02:01:24.857]  When they blow up, you're chanting that at them and letting all this go on.
[02:01:25.077 --> 02:01:25.817]  It's real funny.
[02:01:26.858 --> 02:01:27.698]  It's real funny.
[02:01:27.758 --> 02:01:29.278]  And now you get to have martial law.
[02:01:29.298 --> 02:01:31.058]  But the real target was the middle class.
[02:01:31.498 --> 02:01:32.899]  Now they're getting hit and hit hard.
[02:01:33.219 --> 02:01:34.439]  David and Mash, welcome.
[02:01:35.539 --> 02:01:44.665]  Alex, I believe that your characterization at the first of the program when you described this day as a day that will live in infamy is unquestionably the truth.
[02:01:45.105 --> 02:01:57.292]  This morning, when my wife always likes to get up and turn the TV on as sort of a ritual, uh, Good Morning America, Eddie Kompas, you know, gets on the police chief in New Orleans and actually says it.
[02:01:57.993 --> 02:02:00.694]  We are going to confiscate your weapons.
[02:02:01.435 --> 02:02:02.856]  Straight out of his mouth.
[02:02:02.956 --> 02:02:03.996]  I saw it myself.
[02:02:04.036 --> 02:02:04.937]  I almost fell over.
[02:02:05.515 --> 02:02:06.896]  Now, I got an L.A.
[02:02:06.916 --> 02:02:09.478]  Times... These are unflooded areas, connected to roads.
[02:02:09.738 --> 02:02:11.199]  There's no need, no nothing.
[02:02:11.219 --> 02:02:13.561]  These are power plant workers, nurses, doctors.
[02:02:13.841 --> 02:02:14.702]  They're going, what do you mean?
[02:02:14.742 --> 02:02:16.203]  I'm working at the hospital.
[02:02:16.223 --> 02:02:16.844]  We're not leaving.
[02:02:17.524 --> 02:02:19.826]  Get out of the house or I'm going to blow your head off!
[02:02:20.807 --> 02:02:23.068]  Alex, you know, I've got to tell you about this L.A.
[02:02:23.088 --> 02:02:24.009]  Times article that I have.
[02:02:24.049 --> 02:02:24.650]  Well, stay there.
[02:02:24.670 --> 02:02:26.331]  You can talk to Larry Pratt, too.
[02:02:26.411 --> 02:02:28.172]  And these cops are loving it.
[02:02:28.753 --> 02:02:30.514]  They finally get to take our guns.
[02:02:30.554 --> 02:02:32.415]  They finally get to let us know we're slaves.
[02:02:32.716 --> 02:02:34.317]  They finally get to push us around.
[02:02:35.046 --> 02:02:39.691]  And watch, it'll never emerge from this police state.
[02:02:39.932 --> 02:02:41.994]  There'll be no more Second Amendment in Louisiana.
[02:02:42.534 --> 02:02:43.015]  Understand that?
[02:02:46.696 --> 02:02:49.577]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.817 --> 02:02:51.397]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.737 --> 02:02:56.399]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.739 --> 02:03:01.180]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.600 --> 02:03:05.761]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.001 --> 02:03:08.842]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.922 --> 02:03:13.584]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.784 --> 02:03:18.226]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.446 --> 02:03:25.668]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.908 --> 02:03:28.349]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:45.806 --> 02:03:49.087]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:49.147 --> 02:03:53.308]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.569 --> 02:03:56.349]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.550 --> 02:03:58.950]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:59.130 --> 02:04:07.773]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.973 --> 02:04:09.334]  The Brookie Light is different.
[02:04:09.514 --> 02:04:13.695]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.695 --> 02:04:14.435]  We're good to go!
[02:04:32.961 --> 02:04:33.602]  We're good to go.
[02:04:47.102 --> 02:04:52.427]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:04:52.747 --> 02:04:58.032]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:04:58.452 --> 02:05:01.455]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:05:52.194 --> 02:05:56.419]  Well, the El Presidente of Gun Owners of America will be joining us here in just a moment.
[02:05:56.459 --> 02:05:59.722]  Larry Pratt, Burton Nemo wrote this for PrisonPlanet.com today.
[02:05:59.742 --> 02:06:00.203]  It's on there.
[02:06:01.164 --> 02:06:03.747]  Second amendment nixed in New Orleans.
[02:06:04.990 --> 02:06:12.177]  New Orleans is no longer part of America as a brave new world devised by FEMA and the Ministry of Homeland Security.
[02:06:12.637 --> 02:06:15.860]  In the new New Orleans, there are no constitutional rights.
[02:06:16.040 --> 02:06:28.491]  Not only are soldiers allowed to break down doors, as they do in Iraq, in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and even to shoot to kill if they believe they are threatened as soldiers in Iraq shoot to kill grandmothers and kids at Israeli-style checkpoints.
[02:06:28.992 --> 02:06:31.154]  Now the Second Amendment no longer exists!
[02:06:31.872 --> 02:06:44.337]  Waters were receding across the flood-beaten city today as police officers began confiscating weapons, including legally registered firearms, from civilians in preparation for a mass forced evacuation of the residents still living here.
[02:07:21.664 --> 02:07:27.687]  Alright folks, I apologize.
[02:07:28.047 --> 02:07:33.089]  Every once in a while on a blue moon, my connection to the network of a Minnesota disconnects.
[02:07:33.169 --> 02:07:34.330]  Am I on air now, guys?
[02:07:35.310 --> 02:07:37.131]  Okay, great, because I didn't hear bumper music, nothing.
[02:07:37.151 --> 02:07:39.312]  I was just told to go on air.
[02:07:39.332 --> 02:07:43.854]  And I was reading this article by Curt Nemo about the gun confiscation beginning with pleasure.
[02:07:43.874 --> 02:07:44.374]  Now understand,
[02:07:45.228 --> 02:07:52.738]  The few riots and few problems that were happening were quelled by armed citizens in the middle class areas outside the bowl on the edge of the city.
[02:07:53.078 --> 02:07:55.581]  That's the middle class areas of the city.
[02:07:55.942 --> 02:07:59.226]  Because the more wealthy and middle class can live above sea level.
[02:08:00.382 --> 02:08:01.262]  And they weren't flooded.
[02:08:01.322 --> 02:08:02.342]  They didn't have a problem.
[02:08:02.582 --> 02:08:03.403]  And these are doctors.
[02:08:03.443 --> 02:08:04.143]  These are nurses.
[02:08:04.203 --> 02:08:05.903]  These are power plant managers.
[02:08:06.343 --> 02:08:07.924]  They're like, hey, I'm running the power plant.
[02:08:07.964 --> 02:08:10.184]  Hey, I'm, you know, I, what do you mean?
[02:08:10.264 --> 02:08:13.165]  I, you know, I do maintenance at the, at the police station.
[02:08:13.185 --> 02:08:13.725]  Well, what do you mean?
[02:08:13.785 --> 02:08:14.525]  I can't leave.
[02:08:14.585 --> 02:08:15.425]  I'm infrastructure.
[02:08:15.865 --> 02:08:16.925]  I'm part of this rescue.
[02:08:17.305 --> 02:08:19.406]  And the, and the police are saying, get out of there.
[02:08:19.446 --> 02:08:20.166]  We're going to kill you.
[02:08:21.006 --> 02:08:24.067]  And even though they can't find guns, they go, well, we think you got guns.
[02:08:24.087 --> 02:08:24.687]  We're taking you.
[02:08:25.825 --> 02:08:28.687]  But notice they wouldn't deliver food and water when it was needed for four or five days.
[02:08:28.747 --> 02:08:29.948]  That caused a breakdown.
[02:08:30.248 --> 02:08:32.110]  And you did get a few riots and a few looters.
[02:08:33.231 --> 02:08:34.432]  And a lot of demonization.
[02:08:34.492 --> 02:08:36.713]  And now the police are running around gun confiscating.
[02:08:36.733 --> 02:08:39.095]  So let me finish this article and we'll go to Larry Pratt.
[02:08:39.135 --> 02:08:40.176]  Sorry that cut out earlier.
[02:08:41.312 --> 02:08:43.313]  Second Amendment nixed in New Orleans.
[02:08:43.653 --> 02:08:45.394]  New Orleans is no longer part of America.
[02:08:45.434 --> 02:08:49.096]  It is a brave new world devised by FEMA and the Ministry of Homeland Security.
[02:08:49.116 --> 02:08:52.418]  In the new New Orleans, there are no constitutional rights.
[02:08:52.978 --> 02:08:57.961]  Not only are soldiers allowed to break down doors, a violation of the Fourth Amendment, to shoot, to kill.
[02:08:58.001 --> 02:08:59.602]  They believe they're being threatened.
[02:08:59.622 --> 02:09:02.343]  Now the Second Amendment no longer exists.
[02:09:02.924 --> 02:09:10.468]  Waters were receding across the flood-beaten city today as police officers began confiscating weapons, including legally registered firearms, from civilians.
[02:09:11.087 --> 02:09:13.810]  Now again, why do they call us civilians?
[02:09:13.850 --> 02:09:14.611]  It's legalese.
[02:09:14.751 --> 02:09:17.213]  Why do mayors, why do police chiefs call us civilians?
[02:09:17.393 --> 02:09:18.434]  When they're civilians too.
[02:09:19.655 --> 02:09:23.699]  This term is for a military dictatorship, a federalized military governorship.
[02:09:23.940 --> 02:09:26.262]  They called it that back during Reconstruction.
[02:09:26.982 --> 02:09:32.508]  That's why city managers a decade ago started instructing police and others to call us civilians.
[02:09:33.266 --> 02:09:37.929]  We're now under martial law, military rule, and this is spreading around the country.
[02:09:37.949 --> 02:09:48.977]  It'll be used as a beta test in the rest of the nation to condition and train the public that police running around in goon squads criminally confiscating guns is a good thing and somehow delivers safety and security.
[02:09:49.517 --> 02:09:53.820]  When I've got another New York Times article where citizens describe, well, we're the ones that stopped the looting.
[02:09:54.141 --> 02:09:54.821]  We're in our house.
[02:09:54.841 --> 02:09:55.902]  We've got a year's supply of food.
[02:09:55.942 --> 02:09:57.603]  The water's receding feet every day.
[02:09:58.023 --> 02:09:59.024]  We were never underwater.
[02:10:00.577 --> 02:10:02.378]  I work here in emergency management.
[02:10:02.538 --> 02:10:03.719]  I work at the power plant.
[02:10:03.839 --> 02:10:05.100]  I work at the police station.
[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:06.300]  I am a doctor.
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:07.061]  I am a nurse.
[02:10:07.701 --> 02:10:14.586]  And goons show up with young gang member type military, that's who they recruit now, and just go, you get out here and you give us your guns.
[02:10:15.126 --> 02:10:18.787]  And they kick down doors, and they stick guns in people's faces, and this is all good!
[02:10:19.047 --> 02:10:23.088]  You couldn't bring water, you couldn't bring food, but you can sure take our guns!
[02:10:23.148 --> 02:10:24.048]  You are criminals!
[02:10:24.288 --> 02:10:27.889]  You have no more right to own a gun, police and military, than we do!
[02:10:28.129 --> 02:10:28.969]  We hire you!
[02:10:29.009 --> 02:10:30.169]  We incorporate cities!
[02:10:30.449 --> 02:10:37.470]  We hire you, and you have guns to protect us, but now you say it's not your job to protect us, then you say we don't have a right to protect ourselves!
[02:10:39.311 --> 02:10:40.651]  And I've been to FEMA training drills,
[02:10:41.434 --> 02:10:43.735]  It's their plan to take your guns.
[02:10:43.995 --> 02:10:44.555]  P.D.D.
[02:10:44.815 --> 02:10:44.555]  25.
[02:10:45.075 --> 02:10:47.756]  I've interviewed emergency managers who've been in the meetings.
[02:10:48.976 --> 02:10:49.756]  It came out in 86.
[02:10:50.137 --> 02:10:54.698]  The plan is to use crises, came out in Congress, to take your guns.
[02:10:54.758 --> 02:10:56.358]  They want your guns.
[02:10:56.658 --> 02:10:59.479]  You understand Bush has doubled the size of the B.A.T.F.
[02:10:59.919 --> 02:11:07.322]  You understand Bush has created a... He wants Alberto Gonzalez, who openly is vehemently anti-gun.
[02:11:07.502 --> 02:11:08.602]  And he said two days ago,
[02:11:09.491 --> 02:11:12.493]  The only person he mentioned, he says, I'm looking at Alberto Gonzales!
[02:11:13.213 --> 02:11:13.774]  And you know what?
[02:11:13.814 --> 02:11:15.695]  You fake conservatives are going to love it.
[02:11:16.515 --> 02:11:21.058]  And a lot of you will just be in a little brown shirt cruise and go around and you'll still have your guns, taking ours.
[02:11:21.438 --> 02:11:22.339]  Let me tell you something.
[02:11:23.560 --> 02:11:25.661]  You're not going to have the excuse of the flood everywhere.
[02:11:26.361 --> 02:11:29.143]  Larry Pratt, I am more angry about this than I've ever been.
[02:11:29.163 --> 02:11:30.204]  I appreciate you joining us.
[02:11:30.224 --> 02:11:33.886]  Sorry about some of the technical stuff getting you connected and keeping myself on.
[02:11:34.651 --> 02:11:40.859]  Uh, but we live in strange times, my friend, and, uh... I mean, they're on national TV saying, turn all your guns in.
[02:11:40.899 --> 02:11:42.601]  Law-abiding citizens, turn your guns in.
[02:11:42.862 --> 02:11:46.847]  This hasn't happened since Reconstruction, or Lexington, or Concord, sir.
[02:11:47.387 --> 02:11:52.414]  Well, it's good to be with you, and I would say you're not the only one that's quite upset.
[02:11:53.170 --> 02:11:55.071]  It certainly bothered us.
[02:11:55.231 --> 02:11:56.432]  It's time to impeach Bush!
[02:11:56.692 --> 02:11:59.013]  I want that piece of filth out of there now!
[02:11:59.294 --> 02:12:01.635]  Well, there are people calling our office.
[02:12:02.175 --> 02:12:03.576]  They're just outraged.
[02:12:03.836 --> 02:12:04.677]  I want him gone!
[02:12:04.697 --> 02:12:07.038]  I want him gone for saying he wants Gonzalez!
[02:12:07.814 --> 02:12:17.667]  Yes, that would be, hopefully, a straw that would break a lot of camels' backs, because that guy is bad on lots and lots of things.
[02:12:17.707 --> 02:12:26.378]  He's already openly expressed the view that the court makes the law, and that is a very
[02:12:26.918 --> 02:12:28.399]  Very dangerous notion.
[02:12:28.419 --> 02:12:29.639]  We all know that they believe that.
[02:12:29.759 --> 02:12:32.240]  And he says he wants more than the assault weapons ban.
[02:12:32.300 --> 02:12:34.981]  He doesn't want 12-year-olds having to tell their parents when they have abortions.
[02:12:35.221 --> 02:12:37.362]  He's a member of a Hispanic Ku Klux Klan group.
[02:12:37.762 --> 02:12:39.502]  And he is just pure evil.
[02:12:40.383 --> 02:12:46.265]  Well, we have our hands full, my friend, because I think you've put it well.
[02:12:47.065 --> 02:12:49.026]  New Orleans is a beta test.
[02:12:49.466 --> 02:12:53.207]  The idea that martial law would mean the disarming of people
[02:12:53.735 --> 02:12:59.958]  If you want to declare martial law, if you understand what our founders meant by... You call out the citizens!
[02:13:00.018 --> 02:13:00.618]  Exactly!
[02:13:01.438 --> 02:13:07.961]  Martial law means all of us citizens... You punish criminals, you don't punish everybody!
[02:13:08.181 --> 02:13:14.984]  We're in the militia, and we're supposed to have a gun, and we're supposed to... Okay, you've declared martial law, where do you want us to muster?
[02:13:15.944 --> 02:13:18.125]  And if we didn't have a gun, we were given one.
[02:13:19.024 --> 02:13:21.186]  But now they don't trust us, pieces of trash!
[02:13:21.506 --> 02:13:22.687]  Hey, hey!
[02:13:22.787 --> 02:13:28.631]  These police, these feds, and they're taking guns from law-abiding doctors' houses, they are traitors to America!
[02:13:28.811 --> 02:13:31.834]  They are the same as a red-coated Lexington or Concord, Larry!
[02:13:32.154 --> 02:13:35.376]  They're not going to be there 24 hours to protect these people.
[02:13:35.817 --> 02:13:41.201]  As you said, these people have protected themselves, thank you very much, and now they're going to be disarmed?
[02:13:41.661 --> 02:13:45.784]  You're going to find that those folks who are part of the infrastructure,
[02:13:46.289 --> 02:13:50.612]  Just like you were saying, the doctors, the folks that run the power stations, the nurses.
[02:13:51.033 --> 02:14:01.941]  I was just reading an account of three nurses, and they were buying guns because they're going to go back and work in the downtown area, but they said there's no way we're going back and work there disarmed.
[02:14:03.843 --> 02:14:04.984]  This is unbelievable.
[02:14:05.024 --> 02:14:10.748]  No, I've got New York Times, Washington Post, even AP, where they're going to doctors' houses and just dragging doctors out.
[02:14:10.768 --> 02:14:13.130]  And he's going, I work at the hospital, you idiots!
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:18.582]  And then they're literally like, shut up, slamming... I mean, just what is wrong with these... Ugh.
[02:14:19.303 --> 02:14:20.343]  Well, it's a very bad thing.
[02:14:20.363 --> 02:14:25.785]  I want to tell the police, your daughters, your sons, your grandmothers, nobody's safe when you guys follow these type of orders.
[02:14:26.146 --> 02:14:27.566]  I want Bush impeached.
[02:14:27.626 --> 02:14:35.130]  I want to find out who's given these orders, Larry, and I want you to use your substantive power as gun owners of America to make the call.
[02:14:35.250 --> 02:14:37.371]  It is time to get rid of these people.
[02:14:37.391 --> 02:14:38.431]  I'm sorry, I'm going to shut up.
[02:14:38.611 --> 02:14:41.973]  Well, we are trying to find out who issued the order, and so far,
[02:14:42.957 --> 02:14:44.938]  No, not here.
[02:14:46.158 --> 02:14:50.739]  What authority do they claim they have for what's going on?
[02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:54.140]  Nobody at the state level is able to explain it.
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:15:00.182]  Of course, at the city level, there's not really a city of New Orleans, which raises another question.
[02:15:00.382 --> 02:15:02.843]  Why does anybody care what this former mayor
[02:15:03.470 --> 02:15:06.451]  Has to say, because he doesn't have a city anymore.
[02:15:06.932 --> 02:15:13.214]  Yeah, he's a liberal scumbag, and I'm just going to say it right now, but he is admittedly under FEMA orders.
[02:15:13.254 --> 02:15:14.635]  He is a disgusting puppet.
[02:15:15.315 --> 02:15:23.359]  Well, he may fashion himself under FEMA orders, but he gave the order in his own name, and he doesn't even have a city to administer.
[02:15:23.919 --> 02:15:28.801]  He stole all the money that was sent down there from you and me to fix up his levies.
[02:15:28.861 --> 02:15:30.162]  They didn't fix up the levies.
[02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:37.035]  And now all these chickens are coming home to roost, and he wants to kill the ones that got away from the fox?
[02:15:37.135 --> 02:15:38.797]  Well, we've got the local newscast.
[02:15:38.937 --> 02:15:41.519]  The BATF is coordinating and leading this, my friend.
[02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:48.325]  Well, they seem to have some experience in harassing average citizens, don't they?
[02:15:48.966 --> 02:15:53.230]  You know, statistically, what's going to happen when some old-timers refuse to turn their guns in?
[02:15:55.723 --> 02:16:01.204]  Well, they're substantially outgunned, which is the way the police state operates.
[02:16:01.264 --> 02:16:08.246]  They are putting forth an impressive show of force, and you would have to be better organized than they are.
[02:16:08.266 --> 02:16:14.307]  Well, they don't let photos of the dead come out, so I guess they can kill all the old Korean and World War II and Vietnam vets.
[02:16:14.547 --> 02:16:20.968]  I guess they can just stack all our old dead men up with their military tattoos all over their bodies, and these young scum can just kick them in the head.
[02:16:21.148 --> 02:16:21.428]  Ha!
[02:16:21.468 --> 02:16:22.368]  Killed another vet!
[02:16:22.589 --> 02:16:23.109]  Ugh, yeah!
[02:16:23.309 --> 02:16:24.349]  Ugh, I hate America!
[02:16:24.609 --> 02:16:24.729]  Ugh!
[02:16:25.436 --> 02:16:29.478]  Well, they unhappily think they're doing this for law and order.
[02:16:29.858 --> 02:16:32.079]  They have no idea what law and order means.
[02:16:32.939 --> 02:16:41.702]  These are part of a lawless system, and they are so righteous because they're doing the good for law and order.
[02:16:42.563 --> 02:16:43.943]  It's just upside down.
[02:16:44.003 --> 02:16:49.065]  The whole world right now, Larry, is being sold on gun confiscation.
[02:16:49.085 --> 02:16:50.306]  They've broken the ice.
[02:16:50.406 --> 02:16:51.406]  It's happened, Larry.
[02:16:54.182 --> 02:17:07.690]  They've shown their hand as to how they think a disaster needs to proceed and I think we need to hammer the point you were hammering that these folks went through the worst days of the crisis by themselves.
[02:17:07.790 --> 02:17:16.175]  The police were either in Las Vegas or they were driving their squad cars to Houston or those that chose to stay and fight were just overwhelmed.
[02:17:16.555 --> 02:17:18.997]  In any case, nobody got police protection.
[02:17:19.437 --> 02:17:20.918]  These folks did it themselves!
[02:17:22.131 --> 02:17:29.853]  And now a bunch of goons in their commando outfits are gonna get to drag women around by the... Ah, man, I'm tell... These images, Larry, have you seen these images?
[02:17:30.473 --> 02:17:35.935]  Uh, we've had reports that you can't even show on television what they're doing to the women to make sure they're disarmed.
[02:17:36.375 --> 02:17:38.135]  Oh yeah, boy, I tell you what.
[02:17:38.496 --> 02:17:40.676]  Larry Pratt, please stay there, GOA.org.
[02:17:41.316 --> 02:17:43.477]  Oh my gosh, I'm just... I'm totally freaked out.
[02:17:46.631 --> 02:17:54.536]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[02:17:55.117 --> 02:17:56.437]  What happened to those prices?
[02:17:56.958 --> 02:17:58.679]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[02:18:00.240 --> 02:18:06.244]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[02:18:06.684 --> 02:18:07.224]  The result?
[02:18:07.665 --> 02:18:08.925]  Inflation was born.
[02:18:09.426 --> 02:18:11.507]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[02:18:13.470 --> 02:18:14.354]  What can you do about it?
[02:18:14.796 --> 02:18:17.108]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[02:18:17.944 --> 02:18:23.288]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[02:18:23.708 --> 02:18:28.871]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[02:18:29.312 --> 02:18:31.793]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[02:18:31.813 --> 02:18:33.735]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[02:18:33.755 --> 02:18:36.737]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now!
[02:18:46.480 --> 02:18:49.443]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:18:49.823 --> 02:18:58.632]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:18:58.972 --> 02:19:03.657]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:19:04.117 --> 02:19:10.842]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:19:11.222 --> 02:19:23.011]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:23.491 --> 02:19:27.932]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:19:28.112 --> 02:19:30.573]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:19:30.593 --> 02:19:32.413]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:19:32.433 --> 02:19:33.694]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:19:33.714 --> 02:19:35.174]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:19:35.194 --> 02:19:36.194]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:47.381 --> 02:19:48.542]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:48.942 --> 02:19:54.427]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:19:55.007 --> 02:19:55.508]  That's right.
[02:19:55.808 --> 02:19:58.090]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:19:58.430 --> 02:20:05.596]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:06.138 --> 02:20:13.840]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:14.281 --> 02:20:19.142]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:20:19.762 --> 02:20:22.763]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:25.564 --> 02:20:29.709]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:20:30.090 --> 02:20:30.310]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:30.330 --> 02:20:32.273]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:20:32.353 --> 02:20:32.653]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:32.953 --> 02:20:33.234]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:21:48.564 --> 02:21:50.987]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:21:51.007 --> 02:21:52.869]  I want to be clear here.
[02:21:54.791 --> 02:22:02.741]  If suitcase nukes ever go off in a string of cities, or if there's ever a massive earthquake on the West Coast, which they say is coming,
[02:22:04.921 --> 02:22:06.963]  You can bet the government isn't going to bring you food or water.
[02:22:06.983 --> 02:22:08.324]  They're going to wait until things fall apart.
[02:22:08.344 --> 02:22:10.506]  They're going to come in with martial law, cleaning out the bodies.
[02:22:11.067 --> 02:22:19.635]  And if you're fine at your house with your family, they're going to take you, take your guns, break your family up, put your kids on one helicopter, because they can't keep you together.
[02:22:19.655 --> 02:22:23.819]  And they're going to take your guns, and you just follow orders.
[02:22:26.454 --> 02:22:30.717]  And, uh, the last thing you want in a society is to go disarm the law-abiding people.
[02:22:31.077 --> 02:22:33.599]  Just a few handfuls of gang members running around robbing.
[02:22:33.779 --> 02:22:37.301]  They're already burnt out and caught and there hadn't been any problems in days.
[02:22:37.861 --> 02:22:40.263]  So now let's set about now that nobody's resisting us.
[02:22:40.543 --> 02:22:42.084]  Oh, some gang member's shooting at me.
[02:22:42.264 --> 02:22:43.765]  I better cower in fear.
[02:22:43.785 --> 02:22:45.907]  There's only 5,000 troops against one guy.
[02:22:46.367 --> 02:22:50.990]  Oh, now that everybody's laid down, let's go grab a doctor's wife by the hair.
[02:22:51.110 --> 02:22:53.171]  Yeah, what you got under there, baby?
[02:22:53.251 --> 02:22:54.012]  Ha ha ha!
[02:22:54.787 --> 02:22:56.308]  I mean, this is sick, folks.
[02:22:56.928 --> 02:23:07.895]  Larry Pratt, we need to get the federal government on record to say our policy in emergencies for the whole world is not to go around house to house confiscating your guns.
[02:23:07.915 --> 02:23:09.136]  Of course, they're not going to do that.
[02:23:09.196 --> 02:23:11.197]  We now know what we already knew, Larry.
[02:23:11.217 --> 02:23:12.518]  I've been to the urban warfare drills.
[02:23:12.858 --> 02:23:14.279]  We already know what we already knew.
[02:23:14.919 --> 02:23:15.620]  We're the rebels.
[02:23:15.680 --> 02:23:16.440]  We're the enemy.
[02:23:16.821 --> 02:23:17.881]  It isn't about saving us.
[02:23:17.941 --> 02:23:19.002]  It's about dominating us.
[02:23:19.062 --> 02:23:19.562]  Larry Pratt?
[02:23:19.963 --> 02:23:23.685]  Do you remember the 29 comms survey that was done
[02:23:24.326 --> 02:23:27.889]  At the Marine Corps facility there on the West Coast.
[02:23:28.089 --> 02:23:28.349]  Yes.
[02:23:28.749 --> 02:23:34.834]  And one of the questions was precisely the question that's being put down on the street today.
[02:23:35.775 --> 02:23:40.799]  If you were given an order to confiscate guns from American citizens, would you follow it?
[02:23:41.519 --> 02:23:43.681]  And if they resisted, would you shoot?
[02:23:44.622 --> 02:23:47.804]  And there were about 25% that said, yes, sir.
[02:23:50.606 --> 02:23:54.069]  Well, the 25% seemed to have made their way down to New Orleans.
[02:23:57.423 --> 02:23:58.864]  Larry, I'm going to ask you a question.
[02:23:59.925 --> 02:24:03.007]  What would you do if they came to your door and said, give us your guns?
[02:24:05.088 --> 02:24:08.311]  You know, you've got to be organized.
[02:24:08.391 --> 02:24:16.256]  If you're not organized, there's really not much you're going to do against a whole squad of these guys with their armament.
[02:24:17.277 --> 02:24:23.081]  That's the important thing about just average people being organized.
[02:24:23.121 --> 02:24:25.423]  The militia has to take shape.
[02:24:26.116 --> 02:24:31.681]  And it has to be recognized as something that the government can't... Well, that's why they're so afraid of it.
[02:24:31.721 --> 02:24:33.222]  They're afraid of men getting together.
[02:24:33.262 --> 02:24:35.123]  And I'm not worried about hurricanes, folks.
[02:24:35.143 --> 02:24:36.144]  I'm worried about the government.
[02:24:36.765 --> 02:24:44.291]  We have got to, as we've said for years, get into groups just to defend our families so we're not drug off by the hair and raped by the gang member troops.
[02:24:44.371 --> 02:24:46.593]  You know, let's extend that a little bit further.
[02:24:46.973 --> 02:24:52.317]  It wasn't the government that solved, to the extent that they've been able to solve, the problem in New Orleans.
[02:24:52.958 --> 02:24:53.939]  It was churches.
[02:24:54.459 --> 02:24:55.440]  It was individuals.
[02:24:56.135 --> 02:25:04.721]  And it was even some of the large businesses who had pre-positioned some of their resources to make them available as soon as the rain stopped.
[02:25:04.741 --> 02:25:05.801]  Well, Larry, let's go further.
[02:25:05.821 --> 02:25:09.103]  It was the government that screwed all this up and wouldn't let the food and water in.
[02:25:09.484 --> 02:25:17.969]  And it was the government that helped produce the problem with the levies, and then... And now they get to do this, and they did it on purpose, I'm telling you.
[02:25:18.830 --> 02:25:25.714]  Well, if they didn't, they sure had a series of mistakes that are just incredible, and the attitude
[02:25:26.107 --> 02:25:34.449]  That the Governor of Louisiana had that, well, we don't want the Red Cross bringing in food and water, because that might just encourage more people to come to the Superdome.
[02:25:35.289 --> 02:25:35.589]  Right.
[02:25:37.529 --> 02:25:39.189]  Yeah, let's not let them in there.
[02:25:39.209 --> 02:25:41.430]  Incredible.
[02:25:41.890 --> 02:25:44.690]  Well, these people are just... What are we going to do?
[02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:47.671]  We've got the Democrats on one side, Bush with Gonzales on the other.
[02:25:48.651 --> 02:25:52.572]  The economy's faltering, Greenspan's dancing around talking about a crash.
[02:25:53.357 --> 02:25:57.538]  I mean, Larry, do you feel what I feel that we're on the edge of stuff even worse?
[02:25:57.839 --> 02:25:59.439]  It's a good time not to be in debt.
[02:25:59.499 --> 02:26:01.920]  Have some gold and silver and some MREs.
[02:26:04.021 --> 02:26:04.901]  And, of course, some guns.
[02:26:06.221 --> 02:26:08.882]  Well, I got quite a few guns, and I'm buying more.
[02:26:12.475 --> 02:26:16.438]  All I know is, have you heard, and by the way, we confirmed this, this did happen.
[02:26:16.858 --> 02:26:20.661]  There's multiple Mexican convoys, not the one you hear about in San Antonio with the food.
[02:26:21.041 --> 02:26:27.445]  There's other armed ones, and the Army says, well there's other convoys, but we won't tell you if they're armed or we don't know what's going on.
[02:26:27.826 --> 02:26:29.887]  Well, we've been seeing them here driving through Austin.
[02:26:31.188 --> 02:26:38.333]  Armed Mexican convoys headed north, and I guess they're going to loop around and go to Louisiana or something, but
[02:26:39.233 --> 02:26:40.794]  I guess they're going to try to keep that quiet.
[02:26:40.834 --> 02:26:43.375]  I guess some foreign troops are going to join in.
[02:26:44.115 --> 02:26:53.100]  Perhaps the answer is that if the governor of Louisiana won't let the people be fed, the Mexicans will do it themselves.
[02:26:53.140 --> 02:26:54.380]  What a bizarre world!
[02:26:54.840 --> 02:26:55.841]  This is incredible!
[02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:03.761]  You know, if you wrote a novel... Larry, you've never started laughing?
[02:27:03.821 --> 02:27:05.782]  I mean, this is Twilight Zone, isn't it?
[02:27:06.242 --> 02:27:09.963]  If you ever wrote a novel like this, people would say, my, what an imagination!
[02:27:13.685 --> 02:27:14.385]  It's incredible.
[02:27:14.605 --> 02:27:15.946]  We'll be right back with Larry Prado.
[02:27:16.006 --> 02:27:17.066]  I really appreciate joining us.
[02:27:17.086 --> 02:27:19.487]  We'll tell you how to contact Gun Owners of America.
[02:27:19.507 --> 02:27:20.287]  We'll take some calls.
[02:27:22.028 --> 02:27:23.009]  This is not a joke.
[02:27:23.069 --> 02:27:24.009]  This is not a drill.
[02:27:24.809 --> 02:27:26.330]  This is the real deal.
[02:27:27.190 --> 02:27:28.572]  The real deal!
[02:27:29.193 --> 02:27:32.778]  All the details of the armed Mexican troops are on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:27:35.962 --> 02:27:36.884]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.344 --> 02:27:38.967]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.888 --> 02:27:42.552]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.504 --> 02:27:48.965]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:27:49.546 --> 02:28:03.592]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion and establish a world government?
[02:28:04.233 --> 02:28:13.577]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening and more about Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:28:15.970 --> 02:28:16.431]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:28:16.471 --> 02:28:20.594]  Just call for a one-year free subscription to NewsWatch Magazine.
[02:28:20.914 --> 02:28:21.374]  It's free.
[02:28:21.394 --> 02:28:23.636]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[02:28:46.061 --> 02:28:47.682]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.802 --> 02:28:51.924]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.044 --> 02:28:54.925]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.005 --> 02:29:01.728]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.908 --> 02:29:04.910]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.110 --> 02:29:07.511]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.631 --> 02:29:12.193]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:29:12.233 --> 02:29:13.014]  We're good to go!
[02:29:37.475 --> 02:29:37.615]  808-803-4438.
[02:29:38.236 --> 02:29:40.456]  That's 808-803-4438.
[02:29:40.656 --> 02:29:43.898]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:29:47.759 --> 02:29:54.621]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:29:54.881 --> 02:29:57.242]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:29:57.482 --> 02:29:59.463]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:29:59.783 --> 02:30:05.145]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:30:05.525 --> 02:30:05.645]  Yes!
[02:30:05.665 --> 02:30:09.807]  The Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[02:30:10.247 --> 02:30:12.789]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day.
[02:30:13.009 --> 02:30:18.151]  With its 10 year battery, the Nuke Alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[02:30:18.351 --> 02:30:25.415]  The patented Nuke Alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the US military and numerous other government agencies.
[02:30:25.935 --> 02:30:29.076]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at www.nukealert.com.

[02:30:41.041 --> 02:30:41.541]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[02:30:50.541 --> 02:30:52.463]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:52.943 --> 02:30:55.725]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:30:58.888 --> 02:31:01.690]  It's funny, everything we talk about just keeps happening.
[02:31:02.351 --> 02:31:04.072]  Because we know what we're talking about.
[02:31:04.552 --> 02:31:05.733]  Here's the moral of the story.
[02:31:05.854 --> 02:31:08.055]  The social engineers knew exactly what they were doing.
[02:31:08.916 --> 02:31:17.243]  Again, I've seen the congressional hearings back in 86 when they planned to let a hurricane hit, cause a big problem, let things break down,
[02:31:18.780 --> 02:31:27.223]  Now the chain reaction for martial law and the chairman of the committee in a way said keep your mouth shut, Congressman Brooks from Texas.
[02:31:27.523 --> 02:31:29.263]  We'll talk about that in executive session.
[02:31:30.264 --> 02:31:33.985]  In my first film, America Destroyed by Design, that was the larger plan.
[02:31:34.065 --> 02:31:35.325]  Use any type of crisis.
[02:31:35.985 --> 02:31:36.606]  Frustrated.
[02:31:36.886 --> 02:31:42.247]  FEMA's been caught cutting communications lines, sabotaging the police, holding the police back for days.
[02:31:43.728 --> 02:31:44.348]  That's what happened.
[02:31:46.071 --> 02:31:50.053]  And, uh, they told people, go to the Superdome, and so these poor welfare folks go to the Superdome.
[02:31:50.814 --> 02:31:53.555]  And they don't give them food and water for four days, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:53.575 --> 02:31:54.435]  Things break down.
[02:31:56.436 --> 02:32:14.045]  And then the moral of the story is, if you capitulate and give everything up to the government and sign yourself over and split your family up in many cases, why, we'll give you a little bit of aid, but if you're middle class and in your own house, taking care of yourself high and dry with plenty of food, we're gonna send a SWAT team and we're gonna knock your teeth out.
[02:32:14.086 --> 02:32:14.746]  You got us.
[02:32:15.737 --> 02:32:16.477]  You're the enemy.
[02:32:17.378 --> 02:32:19.799]  The few people shooting at us, we're not going to fight with them.
[02:32:20.579 --> 02:32:22.780]  We're going to come after you, because you're the slaves.
[02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:23.801]  You're the good producers.
[02:32:23.821 --> 02:32:25.282]  You're the big fat cow.
[02:32:25.602 --> 02:32:26.642]  The big fat pig.
[02:32:26.662 --> 02:32:28.263]  The big fat goose we want.
[02:32:29.063 --> 02:32:30.484]  You're going to be a tasty slave.
[02:32:30.504 --> 02:32:38.988]  It's like the prisons release the violent offenders that don't follow orders, but they keep the long-haired pot-smoking hippie that follows orders and works good in the factory.
[02:32:39.228 --> 02:32:40.369]  I'm tired of it, folks.
[02:32:40.709 --> 02:32:42.670]  We're talking to Larry Pratt, goners of America.
[02:32:43.334 --> 02:32:45.174]  Larry, I know you're going to put a big alert out on this.
[02:32:45.214 --> 02:32:46.995]  You say your members are hopping mad.
[02:32:47.355 --> 02:32:48.735]  Have you ever seen them this angry?
[02:32:48.755 --> 02:32:50.136]  I mean, I've never been this angry.
[02:32:51.056 --> 02:32:52.916]  It's been a long time.
[02:32:53.536 --> 02:32:55.677]  The calls that are coming in are just amazing.
[02:32:56.537 --> 02:32:57.997]  Folks can't believe what they're seeing.
[02:32:58.497 --> 02:32:59.458]  Well, I believe it.
[02:32:59.498 --> 02:33:00.218]  I knew it was coming.
[02:33:00.378 --> 02:33:02.618]  Yeah, well, it has come.
[02:33:03.498 --> 02:33:05.739]  And it's come with a viciousness that just
[02:33:06.928 --> 02:33:07.409]  Amazing.
[02:33:08.649 --> 02:33:17.095]  Well, we don't want the Red Cross to get the food and water in there because it would just make more people come to the Superdome, but of course we didn't want the buses in there because that would have gotten the people out of there.
[02:33:18.436 --> 02:33:19.496]  Well, it's all by design.
[02:33:19.636 --> 02:33:21.578]  I mean, they're not this stupid on purpose.
[02:33:22.318 --> 02:33:26.461]  Have you seen the mainstream news articles where they caught FEMA cutting police lines?
[02:33:27.978 --> 02:33:28.919]  No, I missed that one.
[02:33:29.380 --> 02:33:30.581]  Oh, there's hundreds of cases.
[02:33:31.482 --> 02:33:38.289]  And 1,500 firefighters show up to help, and they go, okay, you're now going to have a week of sexual harassment training, and the city's on fire.
[02:33:38.990 --> 02:33:39.230]  Yeah.
[02:33:41.232 --> 02:33:41.472]  Yeah.
[02:33:42.273 --> 02:33:48.220]  No, they don't want folks that might think for themselves and know how to act without
[02:33:49.335 --> 02:33:52.096]  All that kind of martial law type direction.
[02:33:52.116 --> 02:33:56.318]  Yeah, they can't have people in there bringing order in the city coming back and working with the citizens.
[02:33:56.358 --> 02:34:01.140]  What a horrible image the citizens with sandbags with the Army Corps and the cops.
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:05.722]  No, we just gotta have BATF leading giant squads of troops.
[02:34:05.782 --> 02:34:07.222]  Get their guns, men!
[02:34:07.302 --> 02:34:07.923]  Yay!
[02:34:08.003 --> 02:34:08.923]  It's time!
[02:34:09.063 --> 02:34:10.104]  Yay!
[02:34:10.464 --> 02:34:17.166]  Well, what they may have done is succeed in making sure that New Orleans never gets rebuilt.
[02:34:17.307 --> 02:34:18.327]  Certainly not the way it was.
[02:34:19.122 --> 02:34:22.145]  A lot of folks that came out of there do not want to go back.
[02:34:22.705 --> 02:34:25.328]  Well, I mean, again, for those that don't know, it's like a bowl.
[02:34:26.028 --> 02:34:28.871]  And the poor people live right in the middle of it.
[02:34:28.951 --> 02:34:35.276]  But the French Quarter and the wealthier areas, the middle class areas, suburbia, it's all above sea level on the outside of the bowl.
[02:34:35.937 --> 02:34:37.378]  And they've just got a little bit of wind damage.
[02:34:37.418 --> 02:34:40.281]  I mean, that's why the helicopters fly over and it's people in pools waving.
[02:34:40.561 --> 02:34:43.964]  And boy, those helicopters cut that feed off immediately whenever you see that.
[02:34:44.724 --> 02:34:48.888]  But if it's some portable kid who they show it for hours, because that shows the message.
[02:34:48.928 --> 02:34:50.310]  We can take care of ourselves.
[02:34:50.350 --> 02:34:51.751]  We don't want your help, FEMA.
[02:34:53.513 --> 02:34:54.033]  Exactly.
[02:34:54.113 --> 02:35:01.381]  And of course, the ultimate in expression of self-responsibility is the guy with a gun.
[02:35:02.965 --> 02:35:05.407]  Well, it's time to get out of the city if you can.
[02:35:05.807 --> 02:35:07.808]  You should already have some guns and PVC pipe.
[02:35:07.848 --> 02:35:11.430]  It's time to be burying them or ripping out boards under your floorboard in your house.
[02:35:11.470 --> 02:35:13.491]  You may never be allowed in to get your stuff, though.
[02:35:13.691 --> 02:35:17.694]  You're probably going to take it all and give it to Halliburton for a hotel or something.
[02:35:17.734 --> 02:35:19.295]  Don't let them get your guns and your gold.
[02:35:20.215 --> 02:35:23.337]  Larry, it's documented that police are doing things to women.
[02:35:23.497 --> 02:35:24.758]  We don't, with the military.
[02:35:25.658 --> 02:35:26.499]  It is documented.
[02:35:26.519 --> 02:35:27.359]  They are looting.
[02:35:28.880 --> 02:35:31.182]  I mean, I thought government was perfect.
[02:35:32.222 --> 02:35:33.463]  Shouldn't we give up all our freedom to them?
[02:35:33.663 --> 02:35:35.624]  They're there to help us.
[02:35:35.824 --> 02:35:37.806]  Why, that's the only thing they think about.
[02:35:41.408 --> 02:35:43.670]  Larry, I want to take some calls, but anything you want to add?
[02:35:43.690 --> 02:35:45.051]  I mean, I'm ranting here.
[02:35:45.691 --> 02:35:51.495]  Well, we would invite folks to stay in touch with our website, which is gunowners.org.
[02:35:52.295 --> 02:35:54.777]  And in the meantime, let's just go and take some calls.
[02:35:55.356 --> 02:35:57.757]  All right, quickly I'm going to take some calls and we're going to let Larry go.
[02:35:57.817 --> 02:36:01.078]  I'm going to talk about the Mexican troop situation that is serious.
[02:36:01.118 --> 02:36:02.059]  This is real, folks.
[02:36:02.339 --> 02:36:06.681]  Just like you didn't want to believe three days ago when we first got reports of gun confiscation.
[02:36:06.701 --> 02:36:07.901]  Well, that hits the New York Times.
[02:36:08.181 --> 02:36:09.682]  The mayor says it this morning on TV.
[02:36:09.722 --> 02:36:10.382]  Now you believe me.
[02:36:11.663 --> 02:36:12.603]  Last question, Larry.
[02:36:12.623 --> 02:36:13.323]  I forgot this one.
[02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:16.885]  All over the state, they're not letting citizens buy guns or ammo.
[02:36:16.905 --> 02:36:24.348]  While there's roving hordes of criminals that have gone out and run out of money, oh, the message is you can't have ammo, Larry.
[02:36:25.279 --> 02:36:32.182]  Now that has to be a recent order because for a while gun shops have been doing a year's worth of business in a couple of days.
[02:36:32.302 --> 02:36:36.144]  No, I have the articles here and there are some of the towns and parishes that have banned it.
[02:36:36.844 --> 02:36:48.389]  Well, those must be the folks that think just like the guys running New Orleans, how can we run a welfare state where everybody is dependent on us if they can go out there and buy guns?
[02:36:49.833 --> 02:36:50.574]  Pieces of filth.
[02:36:51.674 --> 02:36:56.498]  And folks, Pima's going to get in all this trouble, and we're going to triple your funding and let you run everything!
[02:36:56.718 --> 02:36:57.919]  Bad, bad, bad!
[02:36:58.960 --> 02:37:00.060]  I mean, that really shows them.
[02:37:01.001 --> 02:37:08.186]  That does, and of course they passed a few billion dollar quote relief budget yesterday for New Orleans.
[02:37:09.267 --> 02:37:11.569]  No accountability, no mechanism whatsoever.
[02:37:11.609 --> 02:37:15.892]  And it turns out nobody was allowed to read it, now we're reading it, it's full report, nothing to do with the disaster.
[02:37:17.233 --> 02:37:17.854]  Funny thing.
[02:37:18.414 --> 02:37:20.636]  It's just, we're so corrupt, folks.
[02:37:20.976 --> 02:37:22.818]  Other countries don't operate like this.
[02:37:23.078 --> 02:37:24.279]  What happened to us, Larry?
[02:37:25.860 --> 02:37:31.565]  Well, you got a people that have turned from God and the government becomes to God because somebody's going to be God.
[02:37:32.646 --> 02:37:33.627]  You know, that's true.
[02:37:34.447 --> 02:37:38.010]  Let's go ahead and take calls here.
[02:37:39.011 --> 02:37:40.012]  Who's up first here?
[02:37:41.273 --> 02:37:41.933]  David and Mass.
[02:37:41.953 --> 02:37:42.514]  Go ahead, David.
[02:37:43.422 --> 02:37:45.463]  Oh yeah, hi Alex, and hello to Larry Pratt.
[02:37:45.683 --> 02:37:45.984]  Hello.
[02:37:47.064 --> 02:37:48.745]  Yeah, I wanted to just touch base.
[02:37:48.765 --> 02:37:58.491]  I was telling Alex, I saw this morning when I got up, my wife had the Good Morning America thing on, and Eddie Kompas was saying... Well, somebody sent me that video.
[02:37:58.551 --> 02:37:59.432]  I saw it online.
[02:37:59.452 --> 02:38:00.872]  Yeah, I'll try to get it.
[02:38:00.932 --> 02:38:01.833]  I might be able to get that.
[02:38:02.633 --> 02:38:10.278]  And then today, I went and got this LA Times article, and here's the headline if you want to type it in, if anyone wants to type it in.
[02:38:10.879 --> 02:38:14.783]  Cruz, Rouse, Holdout, race for the body count.
[02:38:15.263 --> 02:38:16.645]  And in here I was shocked.
[02:38:17.085 --> 02:38:19.948]  This is Eddie Compass right here, in this one paragraph.
[02:38:19.968 --> 02:38:20.368]  Listen to this.
[02:38:21.089 --> 02:38:33.881]  Although Nagin has not taken the step of formally declaring an explicit martial law, police have interpreted his recent order declaring a state of emergency allowing the seizure of weapons.
[02:38:34.062 --> 02:38:34.342]  Quote,
[02:38:34.867 --> 02:38:38.609]  Only law enforcement is allowed to have weapons confiscated.
[02:38:38.649 --> 02:38:39.170]  No, I know!
[02:38:39.250 --> 02:38:40.790]  I mean, the cops were just... That's incredible!
[02:38:40.830 --> 02:38:43.132]  The cops were frothing to get our guns!
[02:38:43.172 --> 02:38:47.174]  Anybody that doubted it... That's total evisceration of the Second Amendment right there!
[02:38:47.214 --> 02:38:48.275]  They were frothing!
[02:38:48.735 --> 02:38:54.078]  You know, I mean, a lot of police in polls say they're pro-gun, but I don't think they really mean that, folks.
[02:38:54.418 --> 02:38:54.838]  A lot of them.
[02:38:54.878 --> 02:38:55.759]  Larry Pratt comments.
[02:38:55.799 --> 02:38:56.699]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:38:59.601]  Well, you got a police chief that sure doesn't.
[02:39:00.061 --> 02:39:02.743]  This guy is an actual 10th
[02:39:03.886 --> 02:39:04.787]  Uh, dictator.
[02:39:05.708 --> 02:39:07.750]  He's a very dangerous man.
[02:39:07.770 --> 02:39:11.232]  Uh, he, by his own admission, he may not even have authority.
[02:39:11.473 --> 02:39:12.073]  That's okay.
[02:39:12.273 --> 02:39:13.174]  We're gonna do it anyway.
[02:39:14.135 --> 02:39:16.197]  And they said only we have gods.
[02:39:16.317 --> 02:39:18.178]  And by the way, baby, you look good.
[02:39:18.258 --> 02:39:19.620]  Get, get on your back.
[02:39:20.781 --> 02:39:22.862]  We're gonna have some fun with our women.
[02:39:25.470 --> 02:39:26.950]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:39:26.990 --> 02:39:27.810]  You like tyranny, folks?
[02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:28.771]  You're going to get a lot more of it.
[02:39:28.791 --> 02:39:29.991]  They're going to do this everywhere.
[02:39:30.031 --> 02:39:31.351]  You watch if we don't stop them.
[02:39:31.791 --> 02:39:33.512]  Let's go ahead and talk to Patrick in Maryland.
[02:39:33.552 --> 02:39:34.312]  Patrick, go ahead.
[02:39:34.932 --> 02:39:35.272]  Alex.
[02:39:35.472 --> 02:39:35.752]  Yes.
[02:39:36.232 --> 02:39:38.933]  I thank you for your coverage of the tragedy in the Gulf Coast states.
[02:39:39.353 --> 02:39:40.553]  How's your wife doing?
[02:39:40.573 --> 02:39:42.233]  We'll be glad to see her soon.
[02:39:42.313 --> 02:39:42.813]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:42.853 --> 02:39:43.513]  Go ahead.
[02:39:43.533 --> 02:39:45.314]  Yeah, for having Larry Pratt on.
[02:39:45.574 --> 02:39:47.274]  Just wait till I get your gun.
[02:39:47.314 --> 02:39:47.794]  I'm sorry.
[02:39:48.374 --> 02:39:48.754]  Indeed.
[02:39:49.494 --> 02:39:52.315]  I would like to bring up one very important concern, which you have already addressed.
[02:39:52.944 --> 02:40:02.129]  One vital message of the Gulf Coast tragedy is the extreme, I say extreme importance of personal and family preparedness while it is still possible before the next planned attack.
[02:40:02.731 --> 02:40:06.234]  People all across the country, well, they must have extra stocks of water.
[02:40:06.514 --> 02:40:07.895]  Yeah, I don't talk the talk, folks.
[02:40:07.975 --> 02:40:08.636]  I walk the walk.
[02:40:08.656 --> 02:40:09.717]  I got water filters.
[02:40:09.777 --> 02:40:11.078]  I got your supply of food.
[02:40:11.658 --> 02:40:12.399]  Oh, I'm saying it.
[02:40:12.419 --> 02:40:13.280]  I don't want them to come get me.
[02:40:13.340 --> 02:40:13.840]  I'm warning.
[02:40:14.561 --> 02:40:16.422]  But Larry, comment on what he's saying.
[02:40:17.523 --> 02:40:18.484]  Only amen.
[02:40:18.764 --> 02:40:26.671]  I think this is the time to do something before, you know, one of the more... And notice there's been no mention by the media of getting prepared.
[02:40:27.011 --> 02:40:27.211]  No.
[02:40:27.892 --> 02:40:30.594]  The only thing I saw was a lament by some
[02:40:31.135 --> 02:40:32.177]  We're good to go.
[02:40:44.518 --> 02:40:47.801]  Uh, they said next time, we'll have guns and they'll have to shoot them.
[02:40:48.541 --> 02:40:48.721]  Wow!
[02:40:49.202 --> 02:40:51.323]  No you won't, because the sheriff's coming, baby.
[02:40:51.363 --> 02:40:52.344]  The police chief's coming.
[02:40:52.704 --> 02:40:53.645]  That's true.
[02:40:53.925 --> 02:40:57.528]  Understand folks, they are actually disarming power plant employees.
[02:40:57.848 --> 02:40:59.369]  They are disarming doctors.
[02:40:59.409 --> 02:41:05.954]  They are coming to the middle class, people that have stayed behind with no pay, with blood all over them, and they're going, give it, you're good.
[02:41:05.974 --> 02:41:06.594]  I mean, you've got...
[02:41:08.055 --> 02:41:11.237]  If the looters don't get you, then the cops will in New Orleans.
[02:41:11.337 --> 02:41:14.139]  It's the most amazing spectacle.
[02:41:14.719 --> 02:41:20.242]  I hope this is outraging people enough that there's a national revulsion against this.
[02:41:20.322 --> 02:41:24.405]  Maybe they've gone, we can hope they've gone too far too fast.
[02:41:25.605 --> 02:41:28.127]  I just saw an article after the looters came the police.
[02:41:29.623 --> 02:41:36.267]  Oh, and notice the police would cower with some gang member who didn't even know how to shoot a shotgun, just waving it like an idiot.
[02:41:36.627 --> 02:41:42.850]  And then the cops would cower, but now they love, because they know we're just good middle class people and they can just shove us around.
[02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:43.610]  Yeah.
[02:41:43.931 --> 02:41:45.111]  Oh man, I'm sick of it!
[02:41:46.792 --> 02:41:47.412]  Call it or finish up.
[02:41:47.432 --> 02:41:48.373]  That's exactly what's happening.
[02:41:49.082 --> 02:41:50.983]  Yeah, just, uh... Yeah, go ahead, caller.
[02:41:51.343 --> 02:41:59.588]  It's also extremely important, I emphasize extremely, to stock up on firearms and ammunition while you still get them before all across the country, Marshal Law.
[02:41:59.728 --> 02:42:01.549]  Oh yeah, I'm buying more right now when I leave here.
[02:42:01.869 --> 02:42:10.073]  I mean, people need to dig out old Y2K preparedness material, old civil defense material, or go online to sites which have information on emergency preparedness.
[02:42:10.634 --> 02:42:11.114]  One last thing.
[02:42:11.860 --> 02:42:13.301]  People need to give us serious attention.
[02:42:13.681 --> 02:42:17.303]  Get out of all large and medium-sized cities as soon as possible while you still can.
[02:42:17.323 --> 02:42:19.905]  Well, or if you're in a medium, have an escape route.
[02:42:19.945 --> 02:42:24.288]  Know the police, and this is the FEMA plan, will block major roads, just like in this case.
[02:42:24.508 --> 02:42:25.869]  They want it to get worse.
[02:42:26.289 --> 02:42:29.771]  I mean, I've got several escape routes, several places I can go nearby.
[02:42:30.271 --> 02:42:34.894]  And I mean, let me just tell the gods in black uniforms something.
[02:42:35.274 --> 02:42:37.836]  If you get in the way of my family, you are in deep trouble.
[02:42:38.256 --> 02:42:39.317]  Larry, what do you say to that?
[02:42:40.405 --> 02:42:45.949]  The, um, the stupidity of the way they evacuated the city.
[02:42:46.230 --> 02:42:51.434]  Those that did leave, could leave, that had cars, they were only on two lanes going out.
[02:42:51.814 --> 02:42:54.316]  The other lanes coming into the city were still open.
[02:42:54.876 --> 02:42:58.419]  Well, also, though, but after it happened, the police wouldn't let you leave, though.
[02:42:58.819 --> 02:43:02.402]  And then, right, and then there comes a point when they get that bright idea.
[02:43:02.822 --> 02:43:08.927]  So, you have to know when to move, and it's not when the mayor finally figures out that things are bad.
[02:43:10.077 --> 02:43:14.778]  It's like, we know the government's evil, but they're also like gibbering demons.
[02:43:15.518 --> 02:43:17.479]  They're like retarded, too.
[02:43:18.979 --> 02:43:22.040]  I guess because to be evil, you've got to be stupid in many respects.
[02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:24.960]  Which is something that will help us ultimately.
[02:43:24.980 --> 02:43:30.062]  Thank God, as Will Rogers used to say, we don't get all the government we pay for.
[02:43:31.622 --> 02:43:32.202]  Absolutely.
[02:43:32.362 --> 02:43:33.342]  Let's take another call here.
[02:43:33.402 --> 02:43:34.523]  Good to a point, Patrick.
[02:43:34.583 --> 02:43:35.443]  James in Virginia.
[02:43:35.483 --> 02:43:36.123]  Go ahead, James.
[02:43:37.136 --> 02:43:37.476]  Hello.
[02:43:38.057 --> 02:43:38.337]  Yes, sir.
[02:43:38.357 --> 02:43:40.998]  You're up in Virginia where the police are trying to confiscate your guns.
[02:43:41.038 --> 02:43:42.800]  We aired that news clip earlier.
[02:43:43.320 --> 02:43:44.240]  Oh, I missed that one.
[02:43:44.260 --> 02:43:49.203]  Yeah, rolling out in Virginia, training and calling citizens rebels and practicing shooting you.
[02:43:49.784 --> 02:43:50.524]  Oh, that's lovely.
[02:43:50.564 --> 02:43:51.705]  Well, I'm in Alexandria.
[02:43:52.365 --> 02:43:53.306]  I called last week.
[02:43:53.366 --> 02:43:55.567]  I do the Total 401 Info site.
[02:43:55.707 --> 02:43:57.208]  Sorry it took so long to get back to you.
[02:43:58.689 --> 02:44:04.633]  The one thing I wanted to talk about, it's not really gun related, is the article you have up and some others have up about
[02:44:05.191 --> 02:44:08.574]  Flooding the city to save the rich parts of the city in New Orleans?
[02:44:08.594 --> 02:44:12.457]  Well, that doesn't make sense because you flood one part, it floods the whole thing.
[02:44:12.497 --> 02:44:17.701]  That's what the citizens are saying and that's the disinfo angle and we talk about that.
[02:44:17.761 --> 02:44:19.962]  No, people are... but I mean, go ahead and comment.
[02:44:20.103 --> 02:44:20.823]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:44:20.983 --> 02:44:22.064]  That's what I wanted to say.
[02:44:22.725 --> 02:44:26.087]  You don't save anything by flooding eighty percent of the city.
[02:44:27.348 --> 02:44:32.332]  So, there does seem to be an element of trying to play, you know, the class game here and trying
[02:44:32.782 --> 02:44:38.385]  You know, to consciously rationalize the more wealthy people so they won't question anything.
[02:44:39.826 --> 02:44:40.747]  I totally agree with you.
[02:44:40.767 --> 02:44:48.451]  That headline, I mean, I don't totally agree with what Steve put there, but you read the article, it gets into the other stuff.
[02:44:49.051 --> 02:44:50.232]  The headline is what they're saying.
[02:44:50.692 --> 02:44:52.353]  Yeah.
[02:44:52.393 --> 02:44:54.114]  There's so much to talk about.
[02:44:54.755 --> 02:44:58.417]  New Orleans is crawling with all these mercenaries, these Blackwater people.
[02:44:59.139 --> 02:45:01.081]  I guess the bottom line is, go and make sure you're prepared.
[02:45:21.812 --> 02:45:25.554]  Because the folks in New Orleans, a lot of them are just sitting ducks for this.
[02:45:26.174 --> 02:45:34.637]  The other thing that's important is that the governor in control of the National Guard is still not ordering the National Guard to do these gun confiscations.
[02:45:35.197 --> 02:45:37.959]  It's only the mayor who is screaming about this.
[02:45:37.979 --> 02:45:40.119]  Well, they're letting him do that.
[02:45:40.139 --> 02:45:41.760]  This is all FEMA procedure.
[02:45:42.040 --> 02:45:44.421]  That city's been under FEMA control for a long time.
[02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:48.023]  And they're saying, even the local police are saying, we're trying not to do that.
[02:45:48.083 --> 02:45:50.183]  We're trying to hold off.
[02:45:50.243 --> 02:45:51.364]  You're trying to hold off?
[02:45:52.150 --> 02:46:02.076]  Yeah, well, like last night, for instance, they showed these California Highway Patrol goons going around basically harassing people until they left the city.
[02:46:02.216 --> 02:46:09.921]  Let me tell you, you get me in a position like that with some cops in my face with my family, I'm not putting up with it.
[02:46:10.421 --> 02:46:12.502]  I swear, I am not putting up with it anymore.
[02:46:13.503 --> 02:46:14.463]  I am tired of it.
[02:46:14.583 --> 02:46:15.484]  I am sick of it.
[02:46:16.244 --> 02:46:17.365]  I am just sick of it.
[02:46:17.385 --> 02:46:18.025]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:18.686 --> 02:46:19.426]  I appreciate it.
[02:46:19.766 --> 02:46:20.747]  Aren't you sick of it, Larry?
[02:46:22.436 --> 02:46:30.158]  Hello?
[02:46:30.498 --> 02:46:32.498]  Hello?
[02:46:32.858 --> 02:46:38.259]  Well, I won't back down.
[02:46:38.739 --> 02:46:42.220]  No, I won't back down.
[02:46:42.680 --> 02:46:48.221]  You can stand me outside the gates of hell, but I
[02:46:50.632 --> 02:46:55.114]  Alright folks, when it rains it pours, and I apologize about my line cutting out again.
[02:46:55.134 --> 02:46:57.715]  I got a nice little threat this morning, too.
[02:46:59.015 --> 02:47:00.336]  So, globalists aren't happy.
[02:47:00.356 --> 02:47:00.756]  But you know what?
[02:47:00.796 --> 02:47:01.196]  I'm a man.
[02:47:01.216 --> 02:47:01.916]  I'll always be a man.
[02:47:01.956 --> 02:47:02.937]  You'll always be scum.
[02:47:03.317 --> 02:47:03.977]  That's the way it is.
[02:47:04.017 --> 02:47:05.238]  Let's take another call for Larry Pratt.
[02:47:05.258 --> 02:47:05.938]  We still got Larry?
[02:47:07.178 --> 02:47:07.719]  Okay, good.
[02:47:08.019 --> 02:47:09.279]  Last caller I got time for.
[02:47:09.439 --> 02:47:10.780]  Or maybe we'll take a few.
[02:47:11.080 --> 02:47:12.020]  Jeff and Matt, go ahead.
[02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:12.961]  You're on the air with Larry Pratt.
[02:47:13.301 --> 02:47:13.661]  Ah, yes.
[02:47:13.941 --> 02:47:19.163]  Now, as far as the Mexican troops coming into this country, I was literally outraged, because
[02:47:20.091 --> 02:47:24.373]  Never in our country's history have you ever seen foreign troops in our soil.
[02:47:24.393 --> 02:47:25.153]  Well, this is the deal.
[02:47:25.553 --> 02:47:30.155]  It took more energy bringing them in here than would actually be used to help the people that are hurt.
[02:47:30.395 --> 02:47:32.456]  Number two, why aren't they just relief workers?
[02:47:32.716 --> 02:47:36.857]  Why aren't they the Mexican Red Cross, which, by the way, is a good organization compared to ours?
[02:47:37.738 --> 02:47:46.501]  No, it's because they signed agreements two and a half years ago for Mexican and Canadian troops to, quote, patrol America during disasters and during terrorism.
[02:47:46.521 --> 02:47:47.841]  Now, that's Washington Post.
[02:47:48.142 --> 02:47:49.142]  I have that in one of my films.
[02:47:49.722 --> 02:47:51.604]  So this is about conditioning us.
[02:47:51.664 --> 02:47:55.429]  Now they're talking about bringing in NATO soldiers, which frankly is even worse.
[02:47:55.809 --> 02:48:00.995]  And Ron Paul's office said, regardless of whether they're armed or not, this is unconstitutional and illegal.
[02:48:01.015 --> 02:48:01.536]  Larry Pratt?
[02:48:02.577 --> 02:48:06.962]  Well, we've got to be very grateful we have somebody like Ron Paul who stays on top of this.
[02:48:07.663 --> 02:48:16.106]  And has identified so much of what's being done with chapter and verse and how it doesn't comport with our Constitution.
[02:48:17.207 --> 02:48:20.708]  Small little detail here in this town of Washington, I realize.
[02:48:21.246 --> 02:48:25.212]  But they all took an oath to uphold it, whatever they may believe.
[02:48:25.692 --> 02:48:26.153]  I hear you.
[02:48:26.213 --> 02:48:27.675]  Larry Pratt, thank you for joining us.
[02:48:27.695 --> 02:48:29.037]  I want to get you back up in the near future.
[02:48:29.077 --> 02:48:29.918]  GunOwners.org.
[02:48:30.899 --> 02:48:32.942]  Sign up for the email alerts, and God bless you.
[02:48:33.103 --> 02:48:33.743]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:34.264 --> 02:48:35.726]  Alright, Larry Pratt, great American.
[02:48:35.967 --> 02:48:38.290]  I'm going to come back and talk about the Mexican troops at the end.
[02:48:38.976 --> 02:48:43.918]  For everybody who's going, they don't know what's going on, go to Prison Planet, we have what's really going on.
[02:48:45.679 --> 02:48:47.219]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.359 --> 02:48:50.460]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.580 --> 02:48:54.482]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.542 --> 02:48:58.784]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.124 --> 02:49:02.885]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.025 --> 02:49:04.826]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.026 --> 02:49:08.328]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.368 --> 02:49:13.071]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.251 --> 02:49:16.293]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.454 --> 02:49:19.335]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.816 --> 02:49:25.920]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.460 --> 02:49:30.245]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:30.666 --> 02:49:32.028]  Order your video today.
[02:49:32.368 --> 02:49:33.429]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:49:33.469 --> 02:49:36.233]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.433 --> 02:49:37.394]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:49:45.311 --> 02:49:50.514]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:50.674 --> 02:49:58.759]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.019 --> 02:50:06.063]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.024 --> 02:50:13.509]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.689 --> 02:50:18.773]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:18.893 --> 02:50:27.781]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.041 --> 02:50:31.223]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:01.693 --> 02:51:02.314]  I think so.
[02:51:21.977 --> 02:51:22.377]  I think so.
[02:51:51.749 --> 02:51:54.070]  Don't let yourself cool off about this.
[02:51:54.790 --> 02:52:02.914]  The ID cards, the forced inoculation plans, the forced drugging plans, the amnesty plan, the plan to put Gonzales in as anti-gun.
[02:52:02.934 --> 02:52:09.897]  I mean, it's time for the bootlicking neocon followers to wake up that the Democrats and the Republicans are enemies.
[02:52:10.217 --> 02:52:11.398]  There's no difference.
[02:52:11.418 --> 02:52:12.198]  They're scum.
[02:52:14.255 --> 02:52:17.358]  And when the Democrats get back in, it's time for Democrats to realize that.
[02:52:17.939 --> 02:52:20.181]  I mean, it's just, you've been fooled so long, folks.
[02:52:20.221 --> 02:52:22.623]  I mean, I can't believe I've been right about everything.
[02:52:22.643 --> 02:52:24.185]  I can't believe it just gets worse and worse.
[02:52:24.225 --> 02:52:25.226]  I wish I was wrong.
[02:52:25.286 --> 02:52:27.428]  It's just, it's going to get really bad, folks.
[02:52:27.488 --> 02:52:28.209]  I know that now.
[02:52:28.269 --> 02:52:29.390]  I mean, it's just going to be horrible.
[02:52:30.271 --> 02:52:31.813]  They're going to do such bad things to us.
[02:52:31.913 --> 02:52:36.077]  This is all a big test to find that they're just owning this for the rest of the country.
[02:52:37.376 --> 02:52:39.117]  Are Mexican troops invade U.S.?
[02:52:39.137 --> 02:52:42.799]  Eyewitnesses report under cover of aid, combat-ready soldiers roll into Texas.
[02:52:42.819 --> 02:52:44.941]  Congressman Ron Paul says Mexican troops in U.S.
[02:52:44.981 --> 02:52:46.722]  period is illegal, unconstitutional.
[02:52:47.362 --> 02:52:53.145]  And a lot of fools are calling in to other shows and stuff going, well, you're going to look like a fool.
[02:52:53.185 --> 02:52:55.767]  They just brought some food to San Antonio.
[02:52:56.656 --> 02:52:59.239]  If you read the AP article, it says there's other convoys.
[02:52:59.499 --> 02:53:00.940]  We're not talking about that one.
[02:53:00.960 --> 02:53:05.865]  We're talking about eyewitnesses, two of them I know personally, that saw this convoy.
[02:53:06.285 --> 02:53:08.728]  Who separately didn't know each other, it hadn't been on air.
[02:53:09.168 --> 02:53:11.110]  Who gave me the same description.
[02:53:11.390 --> 02:53:15.054]  They got German Heckler & Koch submachine guns, some variant of those.
[02:53:15.494 --> 02:53:20.559]  Two separate credible sources known to Alex Jones have reported that armed combat ready Mexican troops have entered Texas.
[02:53:21.388 --> 02:53:26.632]  The Associated Press reported today that unarmed Mexican troops were being escorted by U.S.
[02:53:26.732 --> 02:53:28.873]  Army to help relief efforts to Hurricane Katrina.
[02:53:29.173 --> 02:53:31.955]  However, the report was only specific to one convoy.
[02:53:32.296 --> 02:53:39.300]  The convoys reported to Alex Jones, and the same article says there's more than one, are said to be fully armed with Heckler & Koch German assault rifles.
[02:53:39.801 --> 02:53:45.705]  The first sighting occurred at 1230 on Highway 183 traveling towards Austin.
[02:53:46.165 --> 02:53:48.807]  The eyewitnesses described at least 10 vehicles
[02:53:50.143 --> 02:53:57.504]  Four jeeps, other witness said four MVs, and six combat trucks brimming with armed Mexican troops wearing body armor, helmets, and rifles.
[02:53:57.524 --> 02:54:00.945]  The troops riding in the jeeps were wearing holstered handguns.
[02:54:01.005 --> 02:54:08.746]  And I was going to get one of the eyewitnesses on today, and like a maniac, like a maniac, didn't call him and didn't get him on.
[02:54:09.826 --> 02:54:10.666]  I'll do it on Monday.
[02:54:10.707 --> 02:54:11.787]  Sir, I apologize.
[02:54:11.887 --> 02:54:13.127]  I have just been out of control.
[02:54:13.607 --> 02:54:17.388]  The vehicle, I got so mad at the start of the show about gun confiscation, I totally forgot.
[02:54:18.168 --> 02:54:19.388]  We'll get the eyewitness on on Monday.
[02:54:20.723 --> 02:54:22.864]  Maybe we'll try to get him on Jack Blood coming up next.
[02:54:23.024 --> 02:54:23.864]  I'll call him.
[02:54:23.904 --> 02:54:24.524]  The guy's working.
[02:54:24.544 --> 02:54:25.565]  We'll get one of the witnesses on.
[02:54:26.005 --> 02:54:28.746]  The vehicles were not being escorted by U.S.
[02:54:28.866 --> 02:54:35.008]  Army or any other government vehicles, and the vehicles were stained with insignia reading Mexico, MPs, and the Mexican flag.
[02:54:35.428 --> 02:54:39.990]  The second sighting of a similar nature occurred north of Austin on I-35 near Georgetown, Texas.
[02:54:40.490 --> 02:54:49.613]  Prison Planet contacted Congressman Ron Paul's office, whose district is in Texas, and the Congressman's response was, from his office, any Mexican troops here, period, is illegal and unconstitutional.
[02:54:50.445 --> 02:54:50.985]  Which it is.
[02:54:52.786 --> 02:54:59.688]  Another source known to Alex Jones called the Austin Police Department and they said that they knew about the armed troops.
[02:54:59.728 --> 02:55:00.908]  The other source works for me.
[02:55:01.828 --> 02:55:04.469]  The police asked if the troops had threatened the caller.
[02:55:04.729 --> 02:55:08.370]  The caller said they threatened the sovereignty of the country and the police laughed and hung up.
[02:55:09.426 --> 02:55:18.054]  But again, when our Marine died, the Mexican Marine, they buried him down there, and they had fake toy rifles, and they knew it, that they ran up and grabbed him and screamed and yelled.
[02:55:18.075 --> 02:55:19.456]  We have photos of that on the website.
[02:55:19.756 --> 02:55:23.980]  Gee, they know that toy guns, ooh, that's serious, but let us walk all over you.
[02:55:24.501 --> 02:55:27.684]  Stupid police, so stupid, you're always just as dumb as dirt.
[02:55:28.704 --> 02:55:30.326]  I'm sorry, not all of you, but most of you.
[02:55:30.366 --> 02:55:30.967]  I gotta say it.
[02:55:31.307 --> 02:55:40.037]  DPS spokeswoman Lisa Block was the only person to answer any questions on the issue, and she said that the main convoy of 45 vehicles that was escorted by the U.S.
[02:55:40.097 --> 02:55:43.681]  Army and Texas State Police arrived in San Antonio around 4.30 p.m.
[02:55:43.721 --> 02:55:48.287]  on Thursday at San Antonio Air Force Base, formerly known as Old Kelly, now known as Kelly USA.
[02:55:49.053 --> 02:55:49.714]  I'm out of time.
[02:55:49.754 --> 02:55:51.655]  The article's four more pages long.
[02:55:52.196 --> 02:55:52.996]  Total detail.
[02:55:53.457 --> 02:55:55.719]  And for all these talk shows that are going, is it true?
[02:55:55.819 --> 02:55:56.139]  Isn't it?
[02:55:56.419 --> 02:55:57.200]  What's going on?
[02:55:57.260 --> 02:55:57.920]  We don't know.
[02:55:58.221 --> 02:56:00.563]  Why don't you just go to Prison Planet and get the article?
[02:56:01.583 --> 02:56:03.525]  Let's see, a lot of you don't really care about the country.
[02:56:03.925 --> 02:56:07.128]  You don't want to give our website any attention, so you won't even cover the report.
[02:56:07.929 --> 02:56:10.110]  Because you're a bunch of egomaniac nutcases.
[02:56:11.051 --> 02:56:12.873]  Alright folks, I could care less.
[02:56:12.933 --> 02:56:15.235]  I've asked you guys, other people to write articles about this.
[02:56:15.555 --> 02:56:16.856]  I wish you'd make the phone calls.
[02:56:17.822 --> 02:56:22.505]  Just get my videos and get the word out to people and expose the New World Order and never get up your guns!
[02:56:22.565 --> 02:56:23.986]  God bless you all!
