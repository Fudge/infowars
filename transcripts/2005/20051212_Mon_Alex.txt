[00:00:05.557 --> 00:00:06.218]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.878 --> 00:00:07.919]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.741]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:11.242]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.983 --> 00:00:12.864]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.544 --> 00:00:17.367]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.728 --> 00:00:21.871]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:23.293]  Music
[00:00:40.196 --> 00:00:41.596]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.696 --> 00:00:44.438]  It is Monday, the 12th day of December 2005.
[00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:47.660]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.602]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.662 --> 00:00:56.626]  Coming up in the third hour, Jarrett Murphy with his ten unanswered questions.
[00:00:56.646 --> 00:00:58.107]  Of course, we've answered those questions.
[00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:01.109]  We can answer those for him today if you'd like to have them answered.
[00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:01.949]  About 9-11.
[00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:05.779]  Why did NORAD stand down?
[00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:08.061]  Why did Building 7 blow up with total precision?
[00:01:08.721 --> 00:01:10.642]  Why did many of these different things happen?
[00:01:10.702 --> 00:01:24.492]  We'll discuss his ten points and many others, because 9-11 is a foundational, seminal, crossroads, flashpoint zine of four current New World Order criminal activities.
[00:01:24.532 --> 00:01:33.458]  And we track those and chronicle those here on a daily basis, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:01:34.381 --> 00:01:35.261]  So that's in the third hour.
[00:01:35.341 --> 00:01:42.604]  In the second hour, remember the head of the major cable company and internet company in Knoxville, Tennessee?
[00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:47.406]  The chief officer there for that branch of the national company?
[00:01:47.927 --> 00:01:48.907]  Canology, Inc.?
[00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:52.669]  Well, he simply believes in the New World Order.
[00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:57.711]  I mean, if you turn on the TV or read any globalist publication, they say one world government, total control.
[00:01:57.731 --> 00:02:00.012]  And he was very concerned about it.
[00:02:00.092 --> 00:02:03.133]  And against the Iraq War, he's conservative, of course.
[00:02:04.102 --> 00:02:07.925]  And believes that we're slipping into Antichrist grip.
[00:02:07.965 --> 00:02:10.608]  And he just talked about this with some of his friends and others.
[00:02:10.648 --> 00:02:11.909]  And they said, that's it, you're fired.
[00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.471]  Not allowed to do that.
[00:02:14.571 --> 00:02:18.294]  So we have John Gilmore joining us.
[00:02:18.494 --> 00:02:22.958]  But John wrote two detailed letters going over what his beliefs are.
[00:02:22.978 --> 00:02:24.879]  And I agree with basically all of it.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.963]  The reason I say basically all of it is both letters are, I don't know, 20 pages apiece.
[00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:31.885]  And I didn't read all of it.
[00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:34.975]  I scanned over most of it last Friday.
[00:02:35.336 --> 00:02:39.979]  It's going to be posted today up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:50.385]  You're going to see the letters that got Mr. Gilmore fired here in America, having your own views outside work, and you get fired.
[00:02:50.785 --> 00:02:53.347]  And the point is, is these companies will let you have whatever view you want.
[00:02:53.387 --> 00:02:57.730]  You can be a Zoroastrian or an animist, or you can believe in the Tooth Fairy.
[00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:00.560]  And Chinese jet pilots from Mars.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.543]  But if you start talking about real things, you are out the door in a big way.
[00:03:06.583 --> 00:03:07.423]  And this is dangerous.
[00:03:07.443 --> 00:03:09.084]  You know, we're the majority.
[00:03:09.144 --> 00:03:12.986]  The majority of people know something's wrong, know that we're losing our freedoms.
[00:03:13.406 --> 00:03:17.728]  The majority are against national ID cards and open borders and gun control.
[00:03:18.248 --> 00:03:23.990]  And we have to stop letting the minority boss us around and tell us we're bad and tell us what we can and can't do.
[00:03:24.031 --> 00:03:25.071]  So we'll talk about that later.
[00:03:25.592 --> 00:03:35.896]  Coming up, and this will be of particular interest because we're on in the Knoxville area on our fine affiliate WBCR with Harry Rothschild doing a great job down there for so many years.
[00:03:37.637 --> 00:03:41.178]  Also, when we get back from break, FDA Paxil linked to birth defects.
[00:03:41.198 --> 00:03:41.858]  There's another one.
[00:03:42.138 --> 00:03:44.780]  Doctors told not to prescribe Cerarat.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.861]  And the age of autism, a pretty big secret.
[00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:53.563]  UPI has collated a comprehensive conclusive report
[00:03:54.324 --> 00:03:58.228]  Just absolutely proving that mercury fries children's brains.
[00:03:58.789 --> 00:04:07.739]  Now, it's not as if we needed another study to prove this, but this is conclusive with a very large pool of children, and they're called the Amish.
[00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.883]  Ladies and gentlemen, autism is unknown.
[00:04:11.263 --> 00:04:13.445]  There are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of these people.
[00:04:14.086 --> 00:04:15.107]  Absolutely zero.
[00:04:17.535 --> 00:04:22.718]  But then when you look at the few Amish that do happen to get shots in other communities, that's where it does pop up.
[00:04:23.398 --> 00:04:27.780]  There's also a big medical clinic that's noticed people that haven't taken vaccines never get it.
[00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.761]  So we're going to go over that for you.
[00:04:30.782 --> 00:04:32.662]  And watch out!
[00:04:32.742 --> 00:04:37.325]  Police are dressing up like Santa Claus on highways and byways all over the country.
[00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:38.605]  They do it here in Austin sometimes.
[00:04:39.326 --> 00:04:44.728]  Try to look in your car and see if there's something illegal when you're busy waving an old St.
[00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:46.169]  Nicholas sign.
[00:04:46.591 --> 00:04:47.532]  Old Satan Claus.
[00:04:48.353 --> 00:04:51.556]  So, uh... Oh, and just... Folks, there's so much more.
[00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:56.361]  I mean, it's just... Just a massive broadcast lined up for you today.

[00:05:02.375 --> 00:05:05.217]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.478 --> 00:05:06.178]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.278 --> 00:05:07.059]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:12.083]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.423 --> 00:05:19.149]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.489 --> 00:05:21.469]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:24.510]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.271]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:33.872]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.112 --> 00:05:41.334]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.574 --> 00:05:43.995]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:01.408 --> 00:06:04.870]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.651]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:19.056]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.476 --> 00:06:27.380]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:28.540]  We're good to go.

[00:08:05.726 --> 00:08:06.386]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.046 --> 00:08:08.127]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.807 --> 00:08:09.927]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.588 --> 00:08:11.388]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.128 --> 00:08:13.209]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.709 --> 00:08:17.671]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.891 --> 00:08:22.012]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.152 --> 00:08:23.073]  Music
[00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:42.352]  All right, we're now into the first hour, second segment.
[00:08:42.372 --> 00:08:43.874]  We do have two great guests coming up.
[00:08:44.554 --> 00:08:49.521]  The head of a major cable company, their branch division there in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[00:08:50.916 --> 00:08:55.299]  So he believed in a one-world government program of control, and so he was fired.
[00:08:55.339 --> 00:08:56.219]  That's in the second hour.
[00:08:56.640 --> 00:08:59.881]  Third hour, the Village Voice, big article, ten unanswered questions.
[00:08:59.921 --> 00:09:03.384]  Of course, we have answered them, but at least they're now asking the questions.
[00:09:03.804 --> 00:09:05.325]  Why did Building 7 blow up?
[00:09:05.425 --> 00:09:06.846]  Why did NORAD stand down?
[00:09:06.866 --> 00:09:12.889]  And there's a lot of other questions I haven't asked, like why did all the public officials get called up to fly to New York that day?
[00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:15.271]  That is coming up in the third hour.
[00:09:15.291 --> 00:09:17.112]  I wanted to get into...
[00:09:17.956 --> 00:09:33.747]  Some warnings here for parents and just the general public, period, about vaccines, about serotonin reuptake inhibitors that are just on their face, deadly poison, just extremely, extremely toxic.
[00:09:35.208 --> 00:09:37.070]  And then I want to talk some about Iraq.
[00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.731]  And of course, take your phone calls.
[00:09:38.791 --> 00:09:40.412]  And so first off, I'm going to talk about Iraq.
[00:09:41.977 --> 00:09:44.678]  Number one, they say you're a dirty commie rat.
[00:09:44.738 --> 00:09:58.005]  You are a devil-worshipping liberal in league with Beelzebub if you do not mindlessly, totally support the war in Iraq and invading Iran and Syria.
[00:09:58.385 --> 00:09:59.926]  You're not even supposed to ask questions.
[00:09:59.946 --> 00:10:08.250]  You're not even supposed to say, hey, you guys fabricated out of the Vice President's office yellow cake uranium documents, aluminum tube documents.
[00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:12.954]  I mean, there were over a hundred fake reports.
[00:10:13.034 --> 00:10:15.236]  He's going to kill us in 45 minutes.
[00:10:15.696 --> 00:10:17.478]  He's got bio-weapons.
[00:10:17.518 --> 00:10:20.481]  He's going to... Just on and on and on.
[00:10:20.521 --> 00:10:23.364]  And the fear-mongering, we're passing the line of death.
[00:10:23.404 --> 00:10:25.086]  We're sure to be nerve-gassed.
[00:10:25.826 --> 00:10:26.587]  Don't worry, man.
[00:10:26.627 --> 00:10:27.987]  You'll be back by Christmas.
[00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.969]  You'll be back within six months, guaranteed.
[00:10:30.989 --> 00:10:36.712]  And then telling men who've already served sometimes 25 years, oh, we're automatic re-upping you.
[00:10:37.012 --> 00:10:38.333]  You only signed up for five years?
[00:10:38.353 --> 00:10:39.454]  We're going to keep you three more.
[00:10:39.574 --> 00:10:40.034]  Shut up.
[00:10:40.314 --> 00:10:42.455]  We're going to keep you in country for three years.
[00:10:43.015 --> 00:10:45.277]  Didn't even do that in World War II or Vietnam.
[00:10:45.597 --> 00:10:46.417]  You question that.
[00:10:46.717 --> 00:10:50.359]  You question all the bad things they're doing to the troops, how they're cutting their benefits.
[00:10:50.619 --> 00:10:54.061]  They really have given them screwed-up body armor that doesn't work.
[00:10:54.101 --> 00:10:55.102]  They really have given them
[00:10:55.931 --> 00:10:57.973]  Humvees that didn't have armor.
[00:10:58.053 --> 00:11:01.496]  Oh, they had enough of them, just the generals kept them in base for themselves.
[00:11:02.096 --> 00:11:03.638]  We've had General Karpinski on about that.
[00:11:04.038 --> 00:11:05.619]  And this isn't my opinion, folks.
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:07.401]  This is fact.
[00:11:08.602 --> 00:11:12.525]  But last night, I was driving back into work to do some work, Sunday night.
[00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:21.493]  I was listening to local radio, and I listened to about five of the callers, and it was literally, you know, a guy calls and he goes, Listen, I'm not a Democrat, first off.
[00:11:21.954 --> 00:11:23.415]  I consider myself a conservative.
[00:11:24.119 --> 00:11:29.821]  And George Bush is not a real conservative, and he's lied to us.
[00:11:29.961 --> 00:11:32.761]  Now they claim it isn't about WMDs.
[00:11:33.382 --> 00:11:36.983]  Now they claim that it is about democracy.
[00:11:37.483 --> 00:11:38.823]  Now it's about freedom in Iraq.
[00:11:38.863 --> 00:11:40.183]  And he said, well, what about China?
[00:11:40.664 --> 00:11:41.924]  What about North Korea?
[00:11:42.364 --> 00:11:44.205]  What about all these African countries?
[00:11:44.225 --> 00:11:45.005]  This is baloney.
[00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:52.727]  Our government finances dictators and despots and groups that are very controlling all the time.
[00:11:53.943 --> 00:11:59.972]  And the host just basically said, okay, thank you, hung up on him and said, well, that's obviously one of those Democrats.
[00:12:00.533 --> 00:12:02.937]  These Democrats just can't be honest with how they are.
[00:12:04.091 --> 00:12:13.836]  I guess Bob Barr, very conservative voting record, saying we're in danger of martial law, in danger of a military dictatorship, and that Bush is more an anti-gun than Clinton.
[00:12:14.176 --> 00:12:16.977]  I guess he's secretly a Democratic, too.
[00:12:16.997 --> 00:12:19.039]  I guess Ron Paul is.
[00:12:19.079 --> 00:12:20.779]  We're just sneaking around.
[00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:23.181]  We're all secretly dirty commie rats.
[00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:24.381]  No, you are.
[00:12:24.441 --> 00:12:27.743]  It's Bush's administration, run by a bunch of admitted Trotskyites.
[00:12:28.590 --> 00:12:30.191]  That's their own books they've written.
[00:12:30.471 --> 00:12:34.353]  Again, though, the average person who's a neocon follower doesn't read books.
[00:12:34.933 --> 00:12:37.414]  But they might read the third grade level and culture books.
[00:12:37.434 --> 00:12:43.717]  Basically, it's the equivalent of stuff that kids hurl at each other in the playground.
[00:12:44.797 --> 00:12:45.357]  I'm not kidding.
[00:12:45.377 --> 00:12:46.418]  I've debated her on air.
[00:12:46.498 --> 00:12:47.959]  I've read one of her books, two of them now.
[00:12:48.339 --> 00:12:50.860]  And it's just very painful to read.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:55.662]  The point is, then this other caller calls in.
[00:12:56.804 --> 00:12:58.325]  I just, you know, I served.
[00:12:58.385 --> 00:12:59.707]  I got a son over there.
[00:12:59.767 --> 00:13:01.668]  And I always talk in that voice because that's the voice they use.
[00:13:02.389 --> 00:13:04.590]  And the guy was so stupid.
[00:13:05.551 --> 00:13:07.293]  And the host is, oh, thank you for your service.
[00:13:07.353 --> 00:13:07.953]  Oh, we love you.
[00:13:08.013 --> 00:13:08.974]  Oh, you're so good.
[00:13:09.494 --> 00:13:12.957]  Oh, and the guy's, I don't believe that last guy was in the military.
[00:13:14.418 --> 00:13:16.100]  And the host is like, oh, you're probably right.
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.261]  Yeah, probably were.
[00:13:18.782 --> 00:13:21.504]  And it was just all so partisan.
[00:13:22.609 --> 00:13:28.472]  And then he starts going into, we're doing a great job building roads, building bridges, helping those people.
[00:13:28.513 --> 00:13:29.513]  They love us!
[00:13:29.573 --> 00:13:30.614]  They love us!
[00:13:32.115 --> 00:13:35.537]  The controlled liberal media is just lying about our troops.
[00:13:35.577 --> 00:13:36.977]  I was in Vietnam.
[00:13:37.057 --> 00:13:38.258]  It was the same thing then.
[00:13:38.278 --> 00:13:39.939]  We'd have won that war.
[00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:41.360]  We didn't lose that war.
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.541]  We would have won that war.
[00:13:42.601 --> 00:13:45.262]  Real split personality comments.
[00:13:45.282 --> 00:13:49.945]  If it wasn't for the media, the very media owned by the very defense companies...
[00:13:51.646 --> 00:13:55.877]  That had you there by design to lose, to make as much profit as possible over ten years?
[00:13:56.077 --> 00:13:56.920]  You mean those?
[00:13:57.361 --> 00:13:59.186]  But see, you love very people.
[00:13:59.818 --> 00:14:06.560]  That openly have said in documents from 83, 2000, 2002, that we're meant to lose.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.280]  Let me give you the message.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:10.801]  You're meant to be kept in a holding pattern.
[00:14:10.821 --> 00:14:12.441]  You're meant to be balkanized.
[00:14:13.042 --> 00:14:15.702]  We're all against each other, and we're meant to lose troops.
[00:14:15.742 --> 00:14:24.384]  We're meant to create trillions of dollars in profit for the globalists while they build their permanent UN bases, I-4 NATO bases in Iraq.
[00:14:24.665 --> 00:14:26.045]  That is the stated official plan.
[00:14:27.213 --> 00:14:29.254]  And then I heard it all throughout the weekend.
[00:14:29.294 --> 00:14:30.915]  That's what the movie Syriana covers.
[00:14:31.936 --> 00:14:40.081]  All of it is that they're just throwing in our face right now that all the government wants is to break Iraq up into three to four regions.
[00:14:40.141 --> 00:14:41.422]  That was always the plan.
[00:14:41.442 --> 00:14:43.783]  It was never to bring democracy.
[00:14:44.044 --> 00:14:45.925]  These elections are totally staged.
[00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:49.467]  It's just local mullahs and strongmen that are put into power.
[00:14:50.383 --> 00:14:53.145]  And this is exactly what the New World Order wanted.
[00:14:53.406 --> 00:15:02.433]  So do not please, when their own battle plan, when the Pentagon's real plan, I don't mean the ones they post on the White House website and tell you to go read.
[00:15:02.493 --> 00:15:07.837]  I mean the ones that aren't secret, but that don't get publicized, say that we're meant to lose.
[00:15:08.778 --> 00:15:11.040]  And that's finally popping up in major newspapers.
[00:15:12.202 --> 00:15:13.563]  I'm going to ask you a question again.
[00:15:13.583 --> 00:15:20.628]  Does the government and the corporations that control it make more money and more power and more control if we're there a year or if we're there 20?
[00:15:21.328 --> 00:15:22.729]  Dick Cheney says 20, at least.
[00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:29.854]  You see, you're not... And you associate yourself with the oil companies, with the defense contractors.
[00:15:30.915 --> 00:15:31.675]  There's this idea.
[00:15:31.695 --> 00:15:33.196]  In fact, I hear a lot of people calling the shows now.
[00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:33.877]  They're just honest.
[00:15:34.217 --> 00:15:34.797]  You know what?
[00:15:34.837 --> 00:15:35.738]  We need that oil.
[00:15:35.758 --> 00:15:37.699]  We need it to kill all them ragheads.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:41.882]  And you said anything else racist about any other group
[00:15:43.374 --> 00:15:44.355]  It wouldn't be accepted.
[00:15:44.475 --> 00:15:51.862]  Why is it acceptable to call Arabs, Muslims, subhuman?
[00:15:52.522 --> 00:15:54.925]  And then to run around saying they're all planning to kill us.
[00:15:54.965 --> 00:15:58.588]  They have 14-inch fangs dripping with acid.
[00:15:58.608 --> 00:16:00.750]  They're giant vampiric werewolves.
[00:16:00.770 --> 00:16:03.973]  It's just mindless.
[00:16:04.013 --> 00:16:04.834]  And Bill Gertz...
[00:16:06.158 --> 00:16:06.778]  We're good to go.
[00:16:33.102 --> 00:16:42.069]  Just that whole crowd about how, and now Iran's got an EMP bomb that'll knock us into this actual primitive caveman land.
[00:16:42.129 --> 00:16:48.753]  It's at Stone Age, and it'll be over for America, and they could hit us within 30 minutes.
[00:16:51.195 --> 00:16:53.757]  They don't even change the scripts.
[00:16:56.359 --> 00:16:58.060]  Let me tell you the truth about the Arabs.
[00:16:58.781 --> 00:17:00.642]  I'm talking about the Iranians who are the Persians.
[00:17:03.692 --> 00:17:11.075]  There was no one there in Saudi Arabia, in Oman and places like that.
[00:17:11.095 --> 00:17:12.936]  There was no real civilization.
[00:17:12.976 --> 00:17:17.997]  It was Bedouin, goat herders, just wandering about in the desert.
[00:17:19.378 --> 00:17:24.240]  And you'd have local tribes that had been killing each other for thousands of years, and the British government and the U.S.
[00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.041]  government went in, and they'd back whoever the strongest was and whoever played ball.
[00:17:28.962 --> 00:17:30.222]  And in 1918 or 1920, they shut the whole place up.
[00:17:33.644 --> 00:17:44.550]  And then in 1950, they radicalized them and took the most extreme religious writings our government printed, tens of millions, this is all public, and whole shiploads and plane loads of the most radical stuff.
[00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:46.011]  Kill all Westerners.
[00:17:46.191 --> 00:17:46.711]  Kill.
[00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:47.492]  Slaughter.
[00:17:47.632 --> 00:17:48.112]  Murder.
[00:17:48.432 --> 00:17:50.113]  I mean, that's how advanced the globalists are.
[00:17:50.153 --> 00:17:59.018]  They actually paid to proliferate the most radical Islamic views and to make them become the mainstay in many of those countries.
[00:18:00.456 --> 00:18:02.738]  To supposedly fight the communists.
[00:18:02.778 --> 00:18:03.198]  To stop.
[00:18:03.678 --> 00:18:06.461]  And people go, well, that is true, but so what?
[00:18:06.501 --> 00:18:07.341]  Now they're a threat.
[00:18:07.381 --> 00:18:07.862]  Kill them.
[00:18:08.142 --> 00:18:08.842]  Parking lot.
[00:18:08.902 --> 00:18:09.743]  Kill every one of them.
[00:18:10.043 --> 00:18:19.150]  But all those soft people that say that, I'd like to see them be able to go over to Iraq like the troops do and just walk up to a little girl and shoot them five times in the head.
[00:18:19.510 --> 00:18:20.331]  And then see if it's...
[00:18:22.977 --> 00:18:24.718]  I mean, see what they're really saying.
[00:18:24.738 --> 00:18:25.898]  Because I hear it all the time.
[00:18:25.918 --> 00:18:27.499]  Why don't you just kill every one of us?
[00:18:28.119 --> 00:18:29.579]  Get that oil for ourselves.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.381]  As if you're going to get any of that oil for yourself.
[00:18:34.221 --> 00:18:36.522]  As if any of that oil is going to go into your little pocket.
[00:18:36.842 --> 00:18:41.364]  The very same globalists that are engineering this war have engineered your job out of this country.
[00:18:41.604 --> 00:18:43.124]  They openly say America's gone.
[00:18:43.184 --> 00:18:44.125]  China's rising.
[00:18:44.365 --> 00:18:45.205]  It's over for us.
[00:18:45.425 --> 00:18:46.866]  We're being shut down right now.
[00:18:47.126 --> 00:18:47.786]  And our last...
[00:18:48.882 --> 00:18:58.066]  Our last energies, our last substance, our last core is being burnt, is being expended in the engine of world government.
[00:18:58.966 --> 00:19:04.989]  And out of that will be disgraced and take third world status as China and others rise.
[00:19:05.289 --> 00:19:09.390]  And that's what the CFR says on C-SPAN as they laugh at you.
[00:19:10.471 --> 00:19:11.671]  As they laugh at you.
[00:19:12.032 --> 00:19:15.613]  And as Bill Clinton and the Bushes team up and manipulate everybody.
[00:19:15.633 --> 00:19:17.114]  I think the war is good.
[00:19:17.174 --> 00:19:17.934]  I'm Bill Clinton.
[00:19:19.344 --> 00:19:24.572]  And Bush struts around on his cowboy set, out there with his cowboy hat with the hay bales and the rest of it.
[00:19:27.456 --> 00:19:33.965]  It was shameful to listen to these people calling to that talk show last night and bleating.
[00:19:35.267 --> 00:19:35.468]  Just...
[00:19:36.750 --> 00:19:39.451]  I mean, here's this guy that calls in and goes, Look, I didn't like Bill Clinton.
[00:19:39.491 --> 00:19:41.231]  I'm a conservative, but we've been lied to.
[00:19:41.791 --> 00:19:46.233]  And then let me tell you, this is getting really serious, and we need to get out of there.
[00:19:46.253 --> 00:19:48.713]  And what are you, some kind of queer boy?
[00:19:48.733 --> 00:19:51.894]  I ain't about to wave a white flag!
[00:19:53.815 --> 00:19:55.755]  Just unbelievable.
[00:19:56.796 --> 00:19:58.176]  Remember what I said down the road.
[00:20:03.542 --> 00:20:10.188]  Do you desire to increase your energy levels and relieve your pain and stress without chemicals, drugs, or expensive supplements?
[00:20:10.849 --> 00:20:19.197]  TriVortex technology features subtle energy products that boost energy levels, relieve pain and stress, and much more at very affordable prices.
[00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:20.416]  We're good to go.
[00:20:48.891 --> 00:20:57.413]  This is Brian David Anderson, researcher and inventor of the TriVortex Technology products, wishing you and yours a joyous holiday season.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:02.621]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:02.721 --> 00:21:03.621]  Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.761 --> 00:21:07.885]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:08.005 --> 00:21:10.887]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:10.967 --> 00:21:17.672]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:17.852 --> 00:21:20.875]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:21.075 --> 00:21:23.457]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:23.597 --> 00:21:31.903]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine,
[00:21:31.963 --> 00:21:33.944]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:22:01.542 --> 00:22:01.982]  Gold.
[00:22:02.323 --> 00:22:03.624]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[00:22:03.864 --> 00:22:09.948]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[00:22:10.148 --> 00:22:13.971]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[00:22:14.311 --> 00:22:16.213]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[00:22:16.253 --> 00:22:18.535]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[00:22:18.695 --> 00:22:24.599]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency.
[00:22:24.699 --> 00:22:25.440]  We're good to go.
[00:22:40.726 --> 00:22:41.386]  Good as gold.
[00:22:41.566 --> 00:22:47.189]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[00:22:47.489 --> 00:22:50.050]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:56.433]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[00:22:56.573 --> 00:22:58.294]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:00.935 --> 00:23:07.858]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America, why the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[00:23:09.136 --> 00:23:13.197]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[00:23:13.918 --> 00:23:20.960]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:30.603]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.
[00:23:31.263 --> 00:23:36.344]  We'd like to offer you a one-year absolutely free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:02.096 --> 00:24:07.118]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show!
[00:24:07.916 --> 00:24:10.278]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:10.298 --> 00:24:31.871]  But the most incredible thing about this TV show that we're about to play a clip of is that the Australian media, and I've done this myself, goes out and interviews Americans on the street, and some of them just openly come out and say that let's just kill everyone.
[00:24:32.768 --> 00:24:33.589]  They're all slaves.
[00:24:33.629 --> 00:24:34.409]  They're all evil.
[00:24:34.890 --> 00:24:35.710]  They're all bad.
[00:24:35.770 --> 00:24:36.491]  We're America.
[00:24:36.531 --> 00:24:37.432]  We're a superpower.
[00:24:37.472 --> 00:24:38.453]  We're all holy.
[00:24:38.753 --> 00:24:39.473]  Let's torture them.
[00:24:39.513 --> 00:24:40.054]  Let's kill them.
[00:24:40.094 --> 00:24:41.195]  Let's kill all their children.
[00:24:41.215 --> 00:24:43.777]  Because they might want to hurt our children.
[00:24:43.797 --> 00:24:45.578]  Because they're evil.
[00:24:45.598 --> 00:24:46.439]  Because they torture.
[00:24:46.459 --> 00:24:49.421]  So we're going to torture them.
[00:24:49.501 --> 00:24:51.683]  But last night I listened to that radio show.
[00:24:51.843 --> 00:24:53.485]  They were defending the torture.
[00:24:54.305 --> 00:24:56.287]  We just got to get tough in this fight.
[00:24:56.967 --> 00:24:59.990]  And then they went on to say, so what if our government's paying for
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.682]  Paying for newscasts and paying for articles over in Iraq.
[00:25:04.682 --> 00:25:06.523]  So what if they're doing it domestically?
[00:25:06.563 --> 00:25:14.287]  The host, locally on the radio, big station, actually was going, well, Al-Qaeda puts out fake reports, and we've got to counter Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:14.467 --> 00:25:15.848]  Al-Qaeda, give me a break.
[00:25:16.188 --> 00:25:19.450]  You mean CIA terror front to create a pretext for control.
[00:25:20.170 --> 00:25:26.994]  Al-Qaeda puts out false reports, so we've got to put false reports out in America and overseas, and it's good.
[00:25:27.634 --> 00:25:28.995]  So see, now they've gone from
[00:25:30.389 --> 00:25:31.830]  We don't put out fake reports.
[00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:32.830]  There's no fake news.
[00:25:32.850 --> 00:25:35.230]  The Pentagon's not planting news stories.
[00:25:36.791 --> 00:25:38.011]  Well, absolutely.
[00:25:38.031 --> 00:25:38.972]  That's freedom.
[00:25:40.332 --> 00:25:45.953]  Now, I mean, we all grew up learning that Russia was evil because they had state-controlled fake news.
[00:25:45.993 --> 00:25:49.414]  They even had newspapers that claimed to be independent that were state-controlled.
[00:25:49.454 --> 00:25:50.235]  China does that.
[00:25:51.295 --> 00:25:56.977]  And now there was always the corporate-private connection nexus with government.
[00:25:57.037 --> 00:25:58.517]  Now it's just overt.
[00:25:59.255 --> 00:26:04.139]  And they're going to have private mercenaries in America that, quote, control our daily lives.
[00:26:04.179 --> 00:26:06.340]  So now they'll belong to private corporations.
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:12.725]  And by the way, of the 100 biggest economies, 44 of them are now corporations.
[00:26:15.247 --> 00:26:16.868]  And some of the biggest economies...
[00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:24.454]  Well, Walmart now, what, is the 8th largest economy in the world itself.
[00:26:24.634 --> 00:26:29.277]  Walmart is the 8th largest economy in the world, okay?
[00:26:29.558 --> 00:26:32.820]  And 44 of the 100... Do you understand what's happening here?
[00:26:33.832 --> 00:26:42.814]  And these same corporations put on some info babe with thick lipstick, looking at you, all smiling at you, trained to make you feel like she likes you.
[00:26:43.014 --> 00:26:44.174]  It's a television set.
[00:26:44.374 --> 00:26:48.515]  It's a person in New York City behind a camera with a teleprompter.
[00:26:48.795 --> 00:26:50.055]  But it's all designed.
[00:26:50.075 --> 00:26:54.876]  They teach this in these schools to make you think everything's secure, everything's fine, you can trust them.
[00:26:55.156 --> 00:26:57.216]  Look, I'm a sexy info babe, she says.
[00:26:57.556 --> 00:27:00.217]  Arabs all need to die, is basically the message.
[00:27:00.597 --> 00:27:01.497]  They're all devils.
[00:27:02.077 --> 00:27:02.797]  We're good.
[00:27:02.877 --> 00:27:03.578]  You can trust me.
[00:27:03.618 --> 00:27:07.659]  But the problem is, the globalists are in control of this country and are dismantling it.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:25.926]  And so we're going to play, last week I played the TV clip where the news show with the comedy segment on it, it's kind of like the Daily Show is here, goes out and interviews people and says, who should we attack?
[00:27:25.966 --> 00:27:29.567]  And a bunch of people thought that Australia was Iran.
[00:27:31.045 --> 00:27:32.305]  And I found this myself.
[00:27:32.885 --> 00:27:36.566]  In fact, I'm going to go out in the near future with a map and do the same thing because it's so important to illustrate.
[00:27:37.406 --> 00:27:39.367]  And everybody needs to be attacked.
[00:27:39.487 --> 00:27:42.967]  France needs to be invaded because they didn't submit properly.
[00:27:43.688 --> 00:27:46.308]  And by the way, there was a Pentagon report saying that might actually need to happen.
[00:27:46.628 --> 00:27:48.589]  So this is the insanity of these people.
[00:27:49.809 --> 00:27:57.751]  And then we now have the second part of this newscast, this little piece, where they're saying how many countries should be invaded?
[00:27:58.571 --> 00:27:59.911]  Five, six, ten, twenty?
[00:28:00.748 --> 00:28:02.529]  And people are, oh, absolutely unlimited.
[00:28:03.910 --> 00:28:08.312]  And, of course, PNAC says, we're not going to play that clip this segment.
[00:28:08.332 --> 00:28:09.552]  We'll go ahead and pot that down.
[00:28:10.173 --> 00:28:12.974]  We'll play the clip in the next segment.
[00:28:13.514 --> 00:28:16.416]  But it's just amazing.
[00:28:17.623 --> 00:28:18.884]  But they'll argue with you.
[00:28:18.904 --> 00:28:20.165]  They don't have any facts.
[00:28:20.225 --> 00:28:21.306]  They're dumb as dirt.
[00:28:21.787 --> 00:28:23.068]  Dumb as a fence post.
[00:28:23.588 --> 00:28:24.669]  They have no facts.
[00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:25.369]  No nothing.
[00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:29.053]  And if you try to argue with them, they'll just go, Ah, it's a lie.
[00:28:29.073 --> 00:28:29.973]  Just don't even.
[00:28:30.233 --> 00:28:31.835]  Just back off, boy.
[00:28:32.455 --> 00:28:33.316]  But here's the good news.
[00:28:33.336 --> 00:28:37.940]  A couple years ago, 40-50%, depending on the poll, believed the propaganda.
[00:28:38.260 --> 00:28:40.662]  Now it's down to around 28-32%, depending on which poll you want to believe.
[00:28:42.762 --> 00:28:55.008]  Now it's okay for the Morgan Reynolds and the Paul Craig Roberts and the Ron Pauls and the Bob Bars and the General Janice Karpinski's and how many others have we had on?
[00:28:55.468 --> 00:28:59.931]  I mean, it's getting ridiculous to come on and say martial law could be set up in America.
[00:28:59.991 --> 00:29:02.852]  It looks like we're going into a dictatorship of the elite.
[00:29:02.872 --> 00:29:04.173]  They may take our guns.
[00:29:04.573 --> 00:29:05.854]  They are building camps.
[00:29:06.894 --> 00:29:08.175]  World government is here.
[00:29:08.195 --> 00:29:10.676]  I mean, I've had these guests on all saying this.
[00:29:12.165 --> 00:29:13.285]  All saying the same thing.
[00:29:14.166 --> 00:29:15.866]  Conservatives, predominantly.
[00:29:16.266 --> 00:29:17.447]  Real conservatives.
[00:29:17.947 --> 00:29:22.948]  Not the type of conservative that thinks Bush spending more money than all presidents combined is conservative.
[00:29:23.248 --> 00:29:27.429]  Not people that think signing on to UNESCO and the UN to regulate our daily lives is good.
[00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:30.770]  Not people that pass laws that forcibly, psychologically test and drug us.
[00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:33.891]  Not people who want total blanket amnesty for all illegal aliens.
[00:29:34.491 --> 00:29:36.732]  That just isn't conservative, so shut up!
[00:29:37.092 --> 00:29:38.313]  Don't you ever, ever...
[00:29:40.316 --> 00:29:42.799]  Think you're going to get away with it, you scumbags.
[00:29:43.400 --> 00:29:45.422]  You are killing this country.
[00:29:45.502 --> 00:29:47.985]  And I will resist you, scum.
[00:29:51.548 --> 00:29:52.469]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:54.552]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.473 --> 00:29:58.156]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.822 --> 00:30:04.423]  Government is best with government police.
[00:30:04.963 --> 00:30:06.284]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:06.724 --> 00:30:09.426]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:09.866 --> 00:30:12.528]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:12.948 --> 00:30:19.432]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:30:19.752 --> 00:30:27.077]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at libertystickers.com.

[00:30:40.268 --> 00:30:41.710]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:30:41.890 --> 00:30:42.230]  Have you?
[00:30:42.811 --> 00:30:44.312]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:30:46.714 --> 00:30:50.738]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:30:50.878 --> 00:30:51.679]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.760]  Osama been forgotten.
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:59.941]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:31:01.902 --> 00:31:03.522]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:03.642 --> 00:31:07.783]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.883 --> 00:31:10.784]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.844 --> 00:31:17.525]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:17.745 --> 00:31:20.748]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.968 --> 00:31:23.350]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:23.491 --> 00:31:33.620]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:36.321]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:02.176 --> 00:32:08.437]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.657 --> 00:32:13.678]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.998 --> 00:32:21.900]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:29.101]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:29.321 --> 00:32:30.522]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:34.086]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:34.126 --> 00:32:36.828]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[00:32:37.009 --> 00:32:43.855]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:43.975 --> 00:32:46.438]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:32:46.598 --> 00:32:49.519]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.539 --> 00:32:49.579]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:50.620]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:53.621]  I want to play this clip of... This isn't taken out of context.
[00:32:53.761 --> 00:32:55.062]  I mean, I've experienced this.
[00:32:55.102 --> 00:32:56.782]  This is what I'm always talking about.
[00:33:15.211 --> 00:33:18.054]  This clip where people are just like, invade them all, we rule!
[00:33:18.074 --> 00:33:21.917]  Because we're the boss, and you're going to do what we say.
[00:33:21.937 --> 00:33:23.498]  I mean, that's not America.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:33.487]  Just saying that we'll take over whoever we want, we'll kill whoever we want, and the other delusional part of it is, as if our government could do it.
[00:33:35.289 --> 00:33:38.452]  I mean, we are 4% of the world's population.
[00:33:39.512 --> 00:33:41.094]  We had half the wealth...
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:42.341]  We're good to go.
[00:33:42.401 --> 00:33:42.561]  I think?
[00:33:55.791 --> 00:33:57.432]  That had a large middle class.
[00:33:57.492 --> 00:34:02.173]  In fact, middle classes were really unknown until the Renaissance and then the Industrial Revolution.
[00:34:02.213 --> 00:34:04.054]  We had a huge middle class.
[00:34:04.094 --> 00:34:08.195]  The majority of Americans could be considered middle class.
[00:34:08.775 --> 00:34:13.697]  Now it is a very small group that you can truly call middle class.
[00:34:13.717 --> 00:34:20.339]  We've gone from 60% of people being considered middle class in the national statistics down to about 30%.
[00:34:21.914 --> 00:34:22.555]  Thank you for watching!
[00:34:40.689 --> 00:34:48.180]  They're the very ones systematically dismantling this country and the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and your children's future.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:52.367]  And none of it has anything to do with little brown men from Saudi Arabia.
[00:34:52.727 --> 00:34:54.470]  Little brown men from Afghanistan.
[00:34:56.327 --> 00:34:58.510]  Absolutely nothing.
[00:34:59.311 --> 00:35:14.828]  All the Arabs are, all the Persians are, all the Muslims are, is a red flag, a red cape to jiggle in front of the bull's face, so you'll charge into that, and right behind it's a sharp pointed sword to be driven into your chest.
[00:35:16.372 --> 00:35:30.374]  And 9-11 is the little barb, one of the little barbs they throw into the back of the bull's back, into that ganglia of nerves behind their neck, to get him into a frothing, mindless process of just raging.
[00:35:31.535 --> 00:35:32.255]  They have a term for it.
[00:35:32.615 --> 00:35:33.455]  Raging bull.
[00:35:33.575 --> 00:35:34.655]  Seeing red.
[00:35:34.695 --> 00:35:35.995]  They see the cape.
[00:35:36.035 --> 00:35:37.796]  They lose control.
[00:35:38.936 --> 00:35:40.756]  They begin kicking and broncing.
[00:35:42.297 --> 00:35:42.797]  And that's all.
[00:35:42.817 --> 00:35:43.937]  Oklahoma City.
[00:35:44.177 --> 00:35:44.877]  Ah, a little dart.
[00:35:46.358 --> 00:35:47.240]  9-11, bigger dart.
[00:35:48.824 --> 00:35:51.570]  First World Trade Center attack, openly cooked by the FBI.
[00:35:51.970 --> 00:35:53.113]  Openly an FBI operation.
[00:35:53.333 --> 00:35:54.416]  Another barb in the back.
[00:35:59.212 --> 00:36:09.141]  And so we're raging and kicking and then, I mean, a bull that's raging will ram into steel walls, ram into brick walls, ram into just whatever, just frothing wildly.
[00:36:09.561 --> 00:36:11.143]  And so they can just direct us wherever they want.
[00:36:11.203 --> 00:36:11.763]  Get them!
[00:36:11.823 --> 00:36:12.324]  Get them!
[00:36:12.664 --> 00:36:16.768]  I mean, even if you believe their official story, Iraq didn't attack us, but again, does a raging bull care?
[00:36:16.968 --> 00:36:17.849]  Just get them!
[00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:18.309]  Get them!
[00:36:18.689 --> 00:36:20.371]  Meanwhile, it is the matador.
[00:36:20.391 --> 00:36:21.572]  The New World Order is the matador.
[00:36:23.596 --> 00:36:26.698]  And he's there going, come on, bull, get it, get it.
[00:36:26.779 --> 00:36:29.060]  Come on, come get the red cape.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:30.141]  Come get the red curtain.
[00:36:30.161 --> 00:36:41.190]  All right, we're going to go to your calls coming up here, but I want to get into this all this poison in the vaccines and in the drugs.
[00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:42.631]  A lot of news stories on that today.
[00:36:43.251 --> 00:36:44.692]  This is something we don't cover enough here.
[00:36:44.712 --> 00:36:47.334]  There's just so much evidence now pouring out.
[00:36:47.374 --> 00:36:48.615]  The levy has broken on this.
[00:36:48.655 --> 00:36:49.416]  The truth is out.
[00:36:52.162 --> 00:36:59.146]  It's good to go from total ridicule to what we said a decade ago being absolute, common, admitted, accepted fact.
[00:37:00.187 --> 00:37:00.627]  Common.
[00:37:01.648 --> 00:37:03.649]  Passé, but still people submit to it.
[00:37:05.310 --> 00:37:06.030]  There is hope, though.
[00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:14.956]  If we totally discredit these criminals, if we totally get that healthy distrust of government again that the Founding Fathers tried to impart to us, then the globalists can't get away with this anymore.
[00:37:14.976 --> 00:37:16.496]  Then we're not a raging bull.
[00:37:16.757 --> 00:37:18.938]  We're human beings made in the image of God.
[00:37:20.888 --> 00:37:31.611]  But regardless, before I play this clip, Christmas is coming up, the holidays are here, and instead of going out, as many of you are doing, I have not yet been out Christmas shopping.
[00:37:31.631 --> 00:37:33.872]  Well, that's not true.
[00:37:33.892 --> 00:37:35.532]  I've been to a bookstore and bought a few books.
[00:37:35.992 --> 00:37:44.375]  But instead of rampaging like a raging bull through the malls,
[00:37:45.399 --> 00:37:51.260]  Running up your credit cards... By the way, anybody that tells you to run up credit cards and run up debt is absolute scum.
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.220]  I just thought I'd say that on the record.
[00:37:54.801 --> 00:37:56.961]  Run up your credit cards, run up your debt.
[00:37:57.621 --> 00:37:59.942]  They've changed the bankruptcy laws, by the way, folks.
[00:38:00.002 --> 00:38:01.162]  I have an article today.
[00:38:01.722 --> 00:38:04.242]  They're out there mailing out, as I've already pointed out.
[00:38:04.282 --> 00:38:05.123]  It's just common sense.
[00:38:06.403 --> 00:38:09.843]  I've noticed that once you've got a little bit of money, you don't get sent credit cards for every few months.
[00:38:10.183 --> 00:38:13.344]  But when I was totally broke in college, literally eating ramen noodle...
[00:38:14.637 --> 00:38:15.278]  We're good to go.
[00:38:38.192 --> 00:38:39.293]  But, see, side issue.
[00:38:39.313 --> 00:38:39.853]  That's coming up.
[00:38:39.893 --> 00:38:40.593]  That's in the stack.
[00:38:41.074 --> 00:38:47.577]  Record amounts of credit cards being sent out to those who were destitute, see, because they got some nice plans for everybody.
[00:38:47.857 --> 00:38:55.962]  See, the debtors' prisons are coming back, but under a new name, a new guy's community service, attached to the proper corporation.
[00:38:57.242 --> 00:38:58.423]  Side issue, side issue.
[00:38:59.904 --> 00:39:07.068]  Instead of running around buying junk that no one wants, buying the nose hair trimmers, the fruit cakes, the...
[00:39:08.817 --> 00:39:14.001]  Curling irons that you don't even know your wife wants or the foot massage thing.
[00:39:14.362 --> 00:39:15.002]  We've all done it.
[00:39:16.403 --> 00:39:19.706]  Why not just go to InfoAwards.com and your one-stop shop?
[00:39:19.726 --> 00:39:22.168]  We have slash prices in many cases above 75%.
[00:39:22.208 --> 00:39:23.770]  We got deals for my newest DVDs for $5.95.
[00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:23.770]  $9.95.
[00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:24.550]  We got t-shirts for $9.95.
[00:39:24.610 --> 00:39:24.830]  Normally $20.
[00:39:24.871 --> 00:39:25.391]  Made in America.
[00:39:34.486 --> 00:39:42.390]  Instead of signing up for a year membership at PrisonPlanet.tv for all of my films, my Whitley TV reports, special video reports.
[00:39:42.410 --> 00:39:45.492]  I mean, I go to England and places and do reports for you folks.
[00:39:46.352 --> 00:39:48.113]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:39:48.133 --> 00:39:54.337]  Instead of getting three months free when you sign up for a year, now you're getting five months free until the first of the year.
[00:39:54.477 --> 00:39:55.417]  Five months free.
[00:39:55.858 --> 00:39:57.799]  Go get a PrisonPlanet.tv membership.
[00:39:58.019 --> 00:39:58.999]  Get a monthly membership.
[00:39:59.019 --> 00:40:00.000]  Get a yearly membership.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.021]  And give somebody that trial membership for $5.95.
[00:40:05.552 --> 00:40:07.034]  Comes out to 19 cents a day.
[00:40:07.074 --> 00:40:10.177]  The yearly comes out to 11 cents a day.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.801]  So think about that.
[00:40:14.202 --> 00:40:15.283]  Prison Planet.
[00:40:16.774 --> 00:40:26.040]  .tv, my book, Paul Watson's book, burn and download copies of all my films to DVD or to disc, or offload it to a VHS machine.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:26.720]  It doesn't matter.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.601]  It's all there.
[00:40:27.881 --> 00:40:42.269]  An activist dynamo, an armory in the Info War, laden with weapons of truth, proven to smash enemy fortresses, to smash enemy lives, to destroy their capital ships and their propaganda drones.
[00:40:42.730 --> 00:40:43.250]  Literally.
[00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.611]  In the Info War.
[00:40:44.671 --> 00:40:48.495]  Come into the armory, get the weapons, and go after the New World Order.
[00:40:48.556 --> 00:40:50.057]  My new film, Martial Law, is so good.
[00:40:50.317 --> 00:40:51.859]  Three films in one, you've got to have it.
[00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:53.941]  I just want people to see it.
[00:40:53.981 --> 00:40:55.483]  That's what I love.
[00:40:55.864 --> 00:40:59.808]  Knowing you're getting it, knowing you're making copies of it, knowing you're educating others.
[00:40:59.868 --> 00:41:03.412]  Again, I want to thank those that have gotten the films, and I want to thank those that have done that.
[00:41:05.609 --> 00:41:11.312]  Go to Infowars.com to order DVDs or VHS or books or books on tape or T-shirts.
[00:41:11.752 --> 00:41:12.452]  It's all there.
[00:41:12.593 --> 00:41:13.993]  So many new books and videos we've added.
[00:41:14.053 --> 00:41:15.014]  Infowars.com.
[00:41:15.274 --> 00:41:17.935]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a membership for yourself.
[00:41:19.436 --> 00:41:20.817]  And wink, wink.
[00:41:20.877 --> 00:41:27.640]  If you want to get one for yourself, then give the same passcode to your grandma or your son or daughter as a gift.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:29.081]  Fine.
[00:41:29.161 --> 00:41:29.641]  It's just that...
[00:41:30.228 --> 00:41:30.829]  We're good to go.
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:56.940]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.821]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:41:57.841 --> 00:42:02.925]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:42:02.965 --> 00:42:03.706]  Do not wait.
[00:42:03.766 --> 00:42:04.807]  Get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:42:04.847 --> 00:42:06.048]  Get Martial Law.
[00:42:06.068 --> 00:42:10.391]  Get the new film, Order of Death, on the same DVD as the original, but updated, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:42:26.135 --> 00:42:30.398]  The new film and that original on the same DVD or VHS for the same price.
[00:42:31.018 --> 00:42:32.419]  I just want to get the information out.
[00:42:34.521 --> 00:42:37.023]  So again, Infowars.com.
[00:42:37.043 --> 00:42:38.364]  Okay, here's the clip.
[00:42:40.765 --> 00:42:41.826]  Here's the Associated Press.
[00:42:41.886 --> 00:42:43.947]  Most Iraqis oppose Cripp's presence.
[00:42:44.128 --> 00:42:45.789]  More Iraqis disapprove of the U.S.
[00:42:45.809 --> 00:42:51.933]  President's forces in their country, yet they are optimistic about Iraq's future and their own personal lives, according to a new poll.
[00:42:51.953 --> 00:42:52.854]  Let me stop right there.
[00:42:53.254 --> 00:42:54.575]  Two-thirds do not like it.
[00:42:56.391 --> 00:43:00.874]  But another percentage feels optimistic.
[00:43:01.515 --> 00:43:02.736]  It's still a low percentage.
[00:43:03.696 --> 00:43:04.617]  I'll try to read it all later.
[00:43:04.637 --> 00:43:05.257]  We don't have time.
[00:43:05.297 --> 00:43:07.279]  But let me just add this.
[00:43:08.399 --> 00:43:23.250]  What they admit is that hundreds of newspapers in Iraq, basically every newspaper that's allowed to operate, is secretly controlled completely by the Pentagon...
[00:43:24.188 --> 00:43:27.589]  And most of the articles are written in the United States.
[00:43:29.010 --> 00:43:30.770]  And this has all come out in the last week.
[00:43:30.970 --> 00:43:31.791]  More details of it.
[00:43:32.571 --> 00:43:33.991]  Called Information Warfare.
[00:43:34.031 --> 00:43:34.812]  Worse than we thought.
[00:43:34.832 --> 00:43:35.732]  New York Times reports.
[00:43:35.772 --> 00:43:36.852]  Yeah, they should know.
[00:43:37.653 --> 00:43:38.493]  Takes one to know one.
[00:43:39.733 --> 00:43:47.596]  And what it says is that the Iraqis were shocked to learn that most of the articles they were reading were written by Americans in America.
[00:43:49.136 --> 00:43:49.977]  Yeah, written by the CIA.
[00:43:52.446 --> 00:43:54.747]  They were that good, and you know why they were that good?
[00:43:54.967 --> 00:44:00.710]  Because they would badmouth the Americans, but then add lies and use reverse psychology.
[00:44:00.730 --> 00:44:12.496]  Those dumb Americans, they've been trying to get the water on and get people food and set up a college, but they're so stupid that the terrorists were able to attack them, and then they're pathetically laying around crying and dying, and it's just...
[00:44:13.196 --> 00:44:15.419]  And people go, well, they're trying at least.
[00:44:15.439 --> 00:44:16.700]  They're trying to help me.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:21.886]  Well, those dumb Americans, a bunch of them have been killed, so they shot up a car full of kids.
[00:44:22.267 --> 00:44:24.669]  It was an accident, but they're idiots when it was actually on purpose.
[00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:28.774]  So it's all, it's just so sophisticated.
[00:44:29.054 --> 00:44:29.995]  It's the same thing here.
[00:44:30.015 --> 00:44:32.178]  It's the same thing here.
[00:44:33.837 --> 00:44:34.257]  We're good to go.
[00:44:50.894 --> 00:44:56.375]  A huge military SWAT team raids it and arrests everyone at the newspaper for writing mild stuff.
[00:44:56.835 --> 00:44:58.456]  So there are no free newspapers.
[00:44:58.656 --> 00:44:59.536]  There is no freedom.
[00:44:59.716 --> 00:45:03.157]  So next time you get on the radio and you go, they're allowed to vote now.
[00:45:03.397 --> 00:45:04.917]  They're allowed to have newspapers.
[00:45:05.137 --> 00:45:06.077]  They've got freedom.
[00:45:06.317 --> 00:45:08.218]  Why aren't we hearing about that?
[00:45:08.818 --> 00:45:15.599]  We are hearing about it by CIA and Defense Intelligence garbage and State Department garbage.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:19.140]  And don't just think it's the Iraqis.
[00:45:19.784 --> 00:45:24.590]  Thousands of reporters in radio, TV, and print are on government payroll.
[00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:33.501]  They're pulling checks from the Department of Defense, Central Intelligence, NSA, Department of Labor, Health and Human Services, Agriculture.
[00:45:33.721 --> 00:45:36.905]  Some of the worst stuff just comes out of these benign sounding agencies.
[00:45:38.271 --> 00:45:39.151]  I mean, let me just give you the 101.
[00:45:40.092 --> 00:45:47.594]  When your government's spending billions, billions, hundreds of millions per program for fake news, brother, you ain't in a free country.
[00:45:48.114 --> 00:45:51.036]  Or you're in a country sliding real fast in the pit of hell.
[00:45:51.796 --> 00:45:53.716]  I mean, do I have to explain that to people?
[00:45:54.377 --> 00:46:06.361]  I know I'm ranting, it's just... That show last night, anytime I need energy, anytime I'm getting tired of fighting the New World Order, which occasionally happens, I just tune in and hear it, and it is sick.
[00:46:07.421 --> 00:46:08.782]  It is just sick!
[00:46:10.543 --> 00:46:19.270]  Let's go ahead and... And the person locally, I don't think it's an agent on the local radio channel doing that, they just get into Limbaugh and regurgitate whatever Limbaugh and Hannity say.
[00:46:20.110 --> 00:46:22.052]  And they think that's how they get ahead in life.
[00:46:24.954 --> 00:46:27.836]  And they decide that's their ideology.
[00:46:27.856 --> 00:46:29.577]  They decide they believe it's the truth.
[00:46:29.877 --> 00:46:30.858]  They fool themselves.
[00:46:32.870 --> 00:46:34.091]  Let's go ahead and roll this clip.
[00:46:34.151 --> 00:46:34.811]  Listen to this.
[00:46:35.292 --> 00:46:37.933]  This is Americans being asked by Australian TV.
[00:46:39.194 --> 00:46:40.935]  This is a new clip from the same show over there.
[00:46:41.556 --> 00:46:42.556]  Quote one of their daily show.
[00:46:43.137 --> 00:46:44.798]  What country should be attacked?
[00:46:44.838 --> 00:46:46.639]  And listen to the brazen ignorance.
[00:46:47.179 --> 00:46:50.301]  Number one, that we could do all this, take over the whole world.
[00:46:50.782 --> 00:46:51.882]  Number two, that it's our right.
[00:46:52.042 --> 00:46:54.284]  This is called Russia, the evil empire.
[00:46:54.364 --> 00:46:55.925]  Nazi, the evil empire.
[00:46:55.965 --> 00:46:57.586]  This is Julius Caesar.
[00:46:57.866 --> 00:46:59.167]  This is empire, folks.
[00:46:59.807 --> 00:47:02.129]  And you think you're going to be free in a country that does this?
[00:47:03.689 --> 00:47:05.150]  You're going to be part of this power?
[00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:06.731]  That's another misnomer.
[00:47:07.151 --> 00:47:14.474]  Now, here are people who literally, in the same piece, cannot find where countries are on a map, basic countries, don't know anything about their own history.
[00:47:14.774 --> 00:47:18.456]  Most Americans in polls think the Civil War was the Revolutionary War.
[00:47:18.536 --> 00:47:23.659]  Cannot tell you the difference, though there is a 70-plus year separation.
[00:47:23.919 --> 00:47:24.479]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:32.602]  Other than Iraq, how many countries should the U.S.
[00:47:32.642 --> 00:47:35.424]  be allowed to invade during the war on terror?
[00:47:35.684 --> 00:47:37.986]  Three, six, or as many as it likes.
[00:47:38.206 --> 00:47:39.227]  As many as we like.
[00:47:39.307 --> 00:47:40.108]  And why do you say that?
[00:47:40.228 --> 00:47:42.810]  Because we are the superpower.
[00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:43.990]  We control the world.
[00:47:44.151 --> 00:47:46.432]  Actually, as many as we have to, so as many as they like.
[00:47:46.572 --> 00:47:47.433]  Let's go with three.
[00:47:47.553 --> 00:47:47.773]  Three.
[00:47:47.833 --> 00:47:48.694]  And why do you choose that one?
[00:47:50.781 --> 00:47:56.604]  Because in certain circumstances, with countries harboring terrorists, we have the right to go in and get them.
[00:47:56.824 --> 00:47:57.064]  Sure.
[00:47:57.144 --> 00:47:58.645]  And kill them like they're killing us.
[00:47:58.665 --> 00:47:59.325]  There's seven.
[00:47:59.745 --> 00:48:00.045]  Seven?
[00:48:00.406 --> 00:48:01.166]  Okay, why seven?
[00:48:01.786 --> 00:48:03.007]  Well, that's the ones involved in it.
[00:48:03.107 --> 00:48:04.087]  We know about that, so.
[00:48:04.268 --> 00:48:05.228]  Right, okay, which seven are they?
[00:48:05.688 --> 00:48:07.289]  Well, I don't want to name those.
[00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:09.490]  Shit, everybody other than Great Britain.
[00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:10.331]  What about Australia?
[00:48:11.691 --> 00:48:15.413]  Australia better get in line and go hang out with Great Britain and leave us alone.
[00:48:15.513 --> 00:48:16.674]  Those we know are involved.
[00:48:17.302 --> 00:48:18.003]  That's what we're doing.
[00:48:18.063 --> 00:48:19.964]  Surgically removing those involved.
[00:48:20.005 --> 00:48:21.666]  The innocent people won't get hurt if we can help them.
[00:48:21.786 --> 00:48:25.069]  To properly evade September 11, how many Iraqi civilians did the U.S.
[00:48:25.109 --> 00:48:25.329]  kill?
[00:48:25.690 --> 00:48:29.633]  I have the same number as the September 11 death toll, but 10 times the September 11 death toll.
[00:48:29.653 --> 00:48:30.614]  Let's say unlimited.
[00:48:32.063 --> 00:48:32.923]  As many as they need to.
[00:48:32.983 --> 00:48:34.464]  The same, just to even it out, I guess.
[00:48:34.664 --> 00:48:35.064]  Unlimited.
[00:48:35.264 --> 00:48:35.644]  Unlimited.
[00:48:35.704 --> 00:48:39.525]  And that could range from anything of the whole of Baghdad to whatever's needed.
[00:48:39.545 --> 00:48:40.125]  The whole country.
[00:48:40.505 --> 00:48:41.045]  Oh, whatever.
[00:48:41.125 --> 00:48:42.786]  No, I think we should have blew up the whole country.
[00:48:43.106 --> 00:48:47.327]  It's horrible to have, like, civilian casualties, but as many as needed.
[00:48:47.387 --> 00:48:48.007]  Civilians.
[00:48:48.267 --> 00:48:48.927]  Civilians, yeah.
[00:48:48.947 --> 00:48:50.007]  They better get out the way.
[00:48:50.147 --> 00:48:52.508]  They can make the whole country into a big glass parking lot for eye care.
[00:48:52.588 --> 00:48:55.208]  What do you think the US invasion of Iraq should be called?
[00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:57.189]  A. Operation God's Fist.
[00:48:57.830 --> 00:48:59.292]  I like God's fist.
[00:48:59.613 --> 00:49:01.416]  Why do you like that one?
[00:49:01.857 --> 00:49:02.598]  Because God's wrath.
[00:49:07.994 --> 00:49:08.655]  Final solution.
[00:49:08.935 --> 00:49:09.616]  Why do you like that one?
[00:49:09.636 --> 00:49:11.737]  Because that's the way it should be, the final solution.
[00:49:12.158 --> 00:49:14.940]  The people, once they see what we're doing, they're going to get behind us.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:18.003]  I think it should be called, vote for me on election day.
[00:49:18.063 --> 00:49:18.883]  Final solution.
[00:49:19.864 --> 00:49:20.745]  Finishing it up then.
[00:49:21.165 --> 00:49:21.706]  Right, okay.
[00:49:21.766 --> 00:49:22.887]  Is there a rocky frosh?
[00:49:22.907 --> 00:49:23.627]  I guess all of it.
[00:49:32.873 --> 00:49:33.433]  No reason.
[00:49:33.834 --> 00:49:34.214]  All of it.
[00:49:34.674 --> 00:49:34.994]  All of it.
[00:49:35.154 --> 00:49:35.735]  Why do you say that?
[00:49:35.755 --> 00:49:37.015]  That's what I believe.
[00:49:37.075 --> 00:49:39.277]  They came over and... I don't know.
[00:49:39.317 --> 00:49:39.997]  I just have my beliefs.
[00:49:40.017 --> 00:49:45.140]  If they want to come over here and do that crap, then we should go... I don't even have a problem with destroying the whole city.
[00:49:45.260 --> 00:49:46.361]  How does he feel about the USU?
[00:49:46.401 --> 00:49:49.462]  We're going to play the rest later there at the end because we ran out of time.
[00:49:49.502 --> 00:49:50.203]  Back in a little bit.
[00:49:51.063 --> 00:49:52.744]  Now, folks, understand.
[00:49:53.084 --> 00:49:55.946]  Australia has been, in the war, big ally.
[00:49:57.334 --> 00:50:03.328]  And there was a thing out at Crawford where this guy had a thing that said, against the war.
[00:50:04.235 --> 00:50:05.295]  Then you're for terrorists.
[00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:08.156]  But on the top of the sign said, against the war.
[00:50:08.717 --> 00:50:10.237]  So they physically assaulted him.
[00:50:10.257 --> 00:50:12.378]  And he was going, no, I'm with you, I'm for you.
[00:50:12.398 --> 00:50:13.858]  They were like punching him and kicking him.
[00:50:14.059 --> 00:50:15.859]  This was in the Associated Press.
[00:50:15.879 --> 00:50:19.260]  And then finally they saw it and lifted him up and said, we're sorry, he's one of us.
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:20.681]  I mean, I was out there.
[00:50:20.761 --> 00:50:22.582]  I had him just, back off, scum!
[00:50:22.602 --> 00:50:26.123]  And I'm like, but the border's wide open.
[00:50:26.163 --> 00:50:27.783]  He said, shut up, scum!
[00:50:28.104 --> 00:50:29.964]  You're one of them right-wing Republicans then.
[00:50:29.984 --> 00:50:31.285]  I'm like, what?
[00:50:31.305 --> 00:50:31.805]  I mean, it's just...
[00:50:32.879 --> 00:50:35.420]  Just mindlessness.
[00:50:35.641 --> 00:50:36.121]  You heard them.
[00:50:36.161 --> 00:50:36.801]  Just nuke them.
[00:50:36.841 --> 00:50:38.222]  Just kill everyone.
[00:50:38.242 --> 00:50:42.745]  And they'll just be pointing out random countries, not even knowing where they are.
[00:50:42.785 --> 00:50:43.665]  Just kill him!
[00:50:43.705 --> 00:50:44.225]  Kill him!
[00:50:44.445 --> 00:50:45.106]  Kill him!
[00:50:45.566 --> 00:50:48.988]  You ask how the Nazis put people in the concentration camps?
[00:50:49.008 --> 00:50:50.089]  Because it was the enemy.
[00:50:52.090 --> 00:50:53.010]  It was the enemy.
[00:50:53.050 --> 00:50:54.291]  They got to be killed.
[00:50:55.774 --> 00:50:57.755]  What are you, a cattle boy?
[00:51:01.616 --> 00:51:08.478]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.758 --> 00:51:10.138]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.338 --> 00:51:12.539]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.679 --> 00:51:14.779]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:15.059 --> 00:51:20.001]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.321 --> 00:51:24.362]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.602 --> 00:51:26.383]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.463 --> 00:51:37.107]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and pliable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.247 --> 00:51:39.148]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:39.368 --> 00:51:43.230]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.

[00:52:22.912 --> 00:52:23.633]  We're good to go.
[00:52:23.713 --> 00:52:24.473]  We're good to go.
[00:52:49.528 --> 00:52:53.569]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:52:56.549 --> 00:52:58.990]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:53:17.993 --> 00:53:18.593]  I think so too.
[00:53:33.482 --> 00:53:34.003]  We're good to go.
[00:53:34.023 --> 00:53:34.323]  I think?
[00:54:04.111 --> 00:54:10.135]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.735 --> 00:54:13.717]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:16.879 --> 00:54:20.762]  We're posting the second part of this video up on Infowars.com right now.
[00:54:22.603 --> 00:54:29.007]  And the same people that are saying they're going to get behind us once they realize we're helping them are the same ones saying let's nuke and kill all of them.
[00:54:29.888 --> 00:54:33.390]  Because Iraq attacked us on 9-11, but I thought we were there saving them.
[00:54:34.245 --> 00:54:36.387]  And this isn't even a type of war where you drop nukes.
[00:54:38.469 --> 00:54:39.530]  Remember Fallujah?
[00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:41.331]  I don't know, 80,000, 90,000 people.
[00:54:42.152 --> 00:54:45.555]  And a few dozen go and hang up some mercenaries, some contractors.
[00:54:46.075 --> 00:54:48.357]  And so people are on the air going, let's kill everyone in the city.
[00:54:48.437 --> 00:54:48.797]  Nuke them.
[00:54:48.837 --> 00:54:49.598]  That will teach them.
[00:54:50.538 --> 00:54:52.079]  And Ann Coulter called for that.
[00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:53.741]  You're just nuking toddlers.
[00:54:54.321 --> 00:55:01.708]  Let's just nuke them because someone killed our precious contractors that set off the side of the road shooting carloads of families driving by.
[00:55:01.908 --> 00:55:02.929]  We have the video of it.
[00:55:03.390 --> 00:55:03.790]  Shut up.
[00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:06.913]  I mean... This is insane.
[00:55:06.993 --> 00:55:10.436]  This is totally... Go ahead and play the rest of the clip, please.
[00:55:10.976 --> 00:55:11.317]  All of it.
[00:55:11.757 --> 00:55:12.117]  All of it.
[00:55:12.257 --> 00:55:12.858]  Why do you say that?
[00:55:13.419 --> 00:55:14.099]  That's what I believe.
[00:55:14.159 --> 00:55:14.780]  They came over and...
[00:55:15.911 --> 00:55:16.431]  I don't know.
[00:55:16.451 --> 00:55:17.092]  I just have my beliefs.
[00:55:17.112 --> 00:55:22.235]  If they want to come over here and do that crap, then we should go... I don't even have a problem with destroying the whole city.
[00:55:22.455 --> 00:55:25.077]  How would you feel about the US using nuclear weapons against Iraq?
[00:55:25.217 --> 00:55:25.878]  A. Support it.
[00:55:26.218 --> 00:55:27.138]  B. Strongly support it.
[00:55:27.199 --> 00:55:29.520]  Or C. Can't understand what they're waiting for.
[00:55:29.540 --> 00:55:30.621]  Can't understand why we're waiting.
[00:55:30.941 --> 00:55:31.141]  Right.
[00:55:31.181 --> 00:55:31.862]  So long.
[00:55:32.122 --> 00:55:32.842]  A. Support it.
[00:55:32.942 --> 00:55:33.162]  Right.
[00:55:33.242 --> 00:55:33.483]  Okay.
[00:55:33.503 --> 00:55:33.843]  Why's that?
[00:55:34.803 --> 00:55:37.485]  Because they did the same to us.
[00:55:37.725 --> 00:55:37.926]  Sure.
[00:55:37.986 --> 00:55:38.506]  I mean, like...
[00:55:39.133 --> 00:55:40.294]  Now understand, folks, Iraq was our ally.
[00:55:40.314 --> 00:55:43.277]  Attacked who they were told to attack, that exactly as ordered.
[00:55:43.297 --> 00:55:44.938]  They said, go ahead and go into Kuwait.
[00:55:44.958 --> 00:55:45.579]  He said, yes, ma'am.
[00:55:58.712 --> 00:55:59.813]  To April Gillespie.
[00:56:00.293 --> 00:56:02.474]  And boom, all this happens.
[00:56:02.974 --> 00:56:06.015]  Mozadeq, pro-America, anti-communist, wants a little bit of their own oil.
[00:56:06.536 --> 00:56:08.717]  They go in, blow stuff up, blame it on him, take him out.
[00:56:08.757 --> 00:56:09.317]  That's admitted.
[00:56:10.658 --> 00:56:12.478]  Put the Shah in, they get the Al-Tabakamani.
[00:56:12.819 --> 00:56:13.719]  Now look at what we have today.
[00:56:13.739 --> 00:56:16.340]  This isn't about freedom.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:18.681]  It's admittedly for the oil companies.
[00:56:18.741 --> 00:56:21.202]  It's admittedly for centralization of power.
[00:56:21.563 --> 00:56:22.543]  It's not free market.
[00:56:22.583 --> 00:56:24.224]  It's mafia tactics.
[00:56:24.364 --> 00:56:24.464]  And...
[00:56:26.835 --> 00:56:30.977]  Notice these people can't even find Iraq on a map, but they're saying, nuke it.
[00:56:32.077 --> 00:56:32.438]  Nuke it.
[00:56:32.518 --> 00:56:33.518]  What does that mean?
[00:56:33.778 --> 00:56:34.178]  Nuke it.
[00:56:36.179 --> 00:56:38.200]  You see, there's no connection to reality.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:39.981]  These people have never butchered a hog.
[00:56:40.441 --> 00:56:41.562]  They've never been in a car wreck.
[00:56:41.602 --> 00:56:43.563]  They've never been held at gunpoint.
[00:56:44.543 --> 00:56:47.144]  And I haven't lived that life.
[00:56:47.164 --> 00:56:47.925]  I haven't done that much.
[00:56:48.065 --> 00:56:49.585]  They haven't seen what combat is.
[00:56:50.046 --> 00:56:51.606]  They haven't ever experienced pain.
[00:56:51.826 --> 00:56:54.848]  They're just these soft nobodies.
[00:56:55.658 --> 00:56:58.639]  Just on the side of the street going, let's nuke a whole bunch of countries.
[00:56:58.679 --> 00:57:05.042]  And then that one guy, they said, hey, let's go into seven countries.
[00:57:05.082 --> 00:57:05.902]  He said, okay, what seven?
[00:57:06.203 --> 00:57:07.363]  Oh, I don't want to get into that.
[00:57:07.383 --> 00:57:11.285]  Oh, no, because you don't know what seven countries you even want to invade.
[00:57:11.725 --> 00:57:20.969]  You want to invade countries, whole lives, whole worlds, whole peoples, who are just as important as you are, who love their kids probably a lot more than you do.
[00:57:21.764 --> 00:57:23.264]  Just dirt farmers out there.
[00:57:23.304 --> 00:57:23.784]  Nobodies.
[00:57:23.844 --> 00:57:24.405]  Goat herders.
[00:57:24.785 --> 00:57:26.405]  But you don't even know what country they're in.
[00:57:26.425 --> 00:57:28.485]  You just know you want to kill somebody.
[00:57:29.786 --> 00:57:31.766]  You people are a bunch of Jeffrey Dahmers.
[00:57:32.206 --> 00:57:32.986]  You're sick.
[00:57:33.366 --> 00:57:34.947]  We're sick as a society.
[00:57:36.627 --> 00:57:38.147]  But you've got a real threat.
[00:57:38.167 --> 00:57:39.848]  30 million illegal aliens plus here.
[00:57:40.128 --> 00:57:41.308]  Losing all our jobs.
[00:57:41.648 --> 00:57:43.448]  Diseases spreading all over the place.
[00:57:43.548 --> 00:57:44.528]  Leprosy, TB.
[00:57:44.989 --> 00:57:45.349]  All of this.
[00:57:45.369 --> 00:57:46.489]  You don't even know about it.
[00:57:46.529 --> 00:57:47.269]  You don't even care.
[00:57:48.863 --> 00:57:51.865]  And if the school tries to force-drug your kid, you're going to lay down to it.
[00:57:52.085 --> 00:58:02.793]  You'll lay down to any tyranny that's out there, but you'll sit there and hate some imaginary Arab who literally were a bunch of cavemen until the bankers came along.
[00:58:05.555 --> 00:58:06.636]  This is shameful.
[00:58:07.457 --> 00:58:10.299]  This is absolutely shameful.
[00:58:10.819 --> 00:58:14.262]  I know we've got loaded phones and guests coming up, but I have all this other news to cover.
[00:58:15.639 --> 00:58:19.020]  Mainstream news articles admitting you don't take vaccines, you don't get autism.
[00:58:20.540 --> 00:58:29.423]  Mainstream news saying you take serotonin reuptake inhibitors, birth defects out the wazoo.
[00:58:29.463 --> 00:58:31.284]  The molecules of this stuff is deadly poison.
[00:58:31.304 --> 00:58:33.124]  It actually rots holes in your brain.
[00:58:34.224 --> 00:58:35.745]  You might as well snort methamphetamine.
[00:58:35.785 --> 00:58:38.386]  It'll send you to the grave just as fast.
[00:58:41.249 --> 00:58:46.110]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.130 --> 00:58:46.590]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:47.530]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:53.051]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.432 --> 00:58:55.032]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.292 --> 00:58:56.752]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.544 --> 00:59:09.309]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.729 --> 00:59:13.835]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:13.975 --> 00:59:17.359]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:21.765]  We're now into hour number two, coming up in a few minutes.
[00:59:22.558 --> 00:59:25.819]  Headline, opinions on end of days, Illuminati get man fired.
[00:59:25.839 --> 00:59:28.319]  The Knoxville general manager of Canonology Inc.
[00:59:28.339 --> 00:59:38.621]  was fired after repeatedly appeared in local media espousing his beliefs in the coming apocalypse in a shadowy, all-powerful secret organization called the Illuminati, or Satan's Round Tables, what I'd call them.
[00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:40.442]  That'd be a good name for a book.
[00:59:40.882 --> 00:59:42.782]  Mine, Satan's Round Table, not yours.
[00:59:43.722 --> 00:59:49.103]  Okay, and let's go ahead and go through a smattering of calls here.
[00:59:49.163 --> 00:59:51.064]  Patrick and Marilyn, thanks for holding.
[00:59:51.164 --> 00:59:51.484]  Welcome.
[00:59:52.116 --> 00:59:52.436]  Thank you.
[00:59:52.937 --> 00:59:53.237]  Hi.
[00:59:53.497 --> 00:59:56.160]  Here's something that has concerned me over the last several months.
[00:59:56.861 --> 01:00:03.307]  As you know, the Gun Control Act of 1968 was modeled after and plagiarized from the Nazi Gun Control Act of 1938.
[01:00:03.727 --> 01:00:14.317]  That was actually the Weimar Republic Gun Control Act of 28, and then Hitler just expanded it and used it, you're right, in 38.
[01:00:16.297 --> 01:00:20.262]  Well, Senator Dodd was on the Nuremberg, and I actually have copies of this, his letters.
[01:00:20.622 --> 01:00:28.631]  He was on the Nuremberg trial, and he heard about this gun control act, and he had about five words changed, and yes, our gun control law is the German law.
[01:00:29.412 --> 01:00:30.693]  Okay, now what I would like to know is this.
[01:00:30.713 --> 01:00:35.799]  Do you happen to know if the two Patriot acts and some of the collateral anti-terrorism acts
[01:00:36.460 --> 01:00:42.443]  No, well, yes, Soviet Union, yes.
[01:00:42.643 --> 01:00:48.766]  They even hired the former head of the KGB, former head of the East German Stasi.
[01:00:48.806 --> 01:00:51.067]  This is not a joke, folks, to consult.
[01:00:51.867 --> 01:00:56.629]  And, you know, it is just classical, classical police state, yes.
[01:00:57.530 --> 01:01:04.113]  You happen to know where I can get further information, like a comparison of these Soviet laws along with the Patriot Act laws?
[01:01:04.133 --> 01:01:04.593]  I mean, the...
[01:01:06.344 --> 01:01:19.317]  Well, I mean, whereas the 28 Weimar Republic, or Weimar Republic properly pronounced, law is word for word except for a general heading, five words are changed.
[01:01:20.458 --> 01:01:29.027]  Other than that, then you look at Soviet laws, it's just they're modeling and consulting off of that and using models that worked.
[01:01:29.771 --> 01:01:41.362]  I don't know of specific instances where the Russian or the Slavic was translated directly over to English, but we know they're consulting and doing that.
[01:01:42.182 --> 01:01:46.586]  You don't think they drafted some of this perhaps from communist Chinese laws or maybe fascist Italian laws, too?
[01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:50.430]  Well, I mean, look, it's not our first rodeo, either.
[01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:52.772]  I mean, tyrants just write laws themselves.
[01:01:53.372 --> 01:01:53.793]  That's true.
[01:01:55.174 --> 01:01:56.235]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:01:56.255 --> 01:01:57.176]  I really appreciate it.
[01:01:57.256 --> 01:01:57.896]  J.R.
[01:01:58.357 --> 01:01:58.977]  in New York.
[01:01:59.037 --> 01:01:59.918]  J.R., go ahead.
[01:01:59.938 --> 01:02:01.860]  Hello, Alex.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:02.400]  Hi.
[01:02:02.620 --> 01:02:02.860]  Hi.
[01:02:02.941 --> 01:02:04.542]  Happy slave product season.
[01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:05.222]  Yes.
[01:02:05.703 --> 01:02:08.765]  I'm going to run out and get as much debt as possible to buy them.
[01:02:09.126 --> 01:02:10.487]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:10.507 --> 01:02:24.078]  Hey, I wanted to ask you, Alex, I don't know if you can discuss this, if you had any recent information on the status on the four-star general Kevin Burns.
[01:02:24.799 --> 01:02:25.680]  No, we don't know.
[01:02:25.941 --> 01:02:31.188]  We've tried over and over again to get him a very mysterious case of him being fired.
[01:02:31.208 --> 01:02:34.653]  He was about to retire, and we don't know what happened with him.
[01:02:34.953 --> 01:02:39.639]  Do you guys have any information on what's going on inside the Pentagon?
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.922]  I'm just curious to see what's going on within the ranks.
[01:02:43.354 --> 01:02:46.535]  Massive resistance, contrary to what we hear every ten seconds.
[01:02:46.575 --> 01:02:47.416]  The troops all love it.
[01:02:47.616 --> 01:02:48.516]  Morale's really high.
[01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:49.276]  Everything's great.
[01:02:49.576 --> 01:02:55.258]  Then the official internal reports come out, and it's just, we've never had morale this low in our entire history.
[01:02:55.718 --> 01:02:57.139]  Everything's falling apart.
[01:02:57.579 --> 01:03:00.600]  But meanwhile, national news, the troops are absolutely loving it.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:01.941]  Everything's wonderful.
[01:03:02.781 --> 01:03:10.564]  And I also just wanted to mention to anybody who's in the New York tri-state area, please come by every Sunday at 6.30 p.m.
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:12.200]  The St.
[01:03:12.260 --> 01:03:21.928]  Mark's Church in the East Village of Manhattan for ny911truth.org, 9-11 Truth Meetings.
[01:03:22.909 --> 01:03:26.012]  We're making good progress, and we're getting things done.
[01:03:26.152 --> 01:03:28.814]  So it's ny911truth.org.
[01:03:29.975 --> 01:03:30.756]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[01:03:30.776 --> 01:03:31.336]  Thank you, sir.
[01:03:31.376 --> 01:03:32.417]  You guys keep it up.
[01:03:32.457 --> 01:03:37.041]  Sorry I'm cutting you so short, the callers, because I kind of ran on in the last hour.
[01:03:37.825 --> 01:03:41.927]  A little bit upset hearing that talk show host say torture was wonderful and fake news was American.
[01:03:43.048 --> 01:03:45.629]  When we get back, we'll talk to our very special guest.
[01:03:46.149 --> 01:03:46.530]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.457 --> 01:03:57.298]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.578 --> 01:03:59.138]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.478 --> 01:04:04.160]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:08.901]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.341 --> 01:04:13.562]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.762 --> 01:04:16.603]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.683 --> 01:04:19.164]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[01:04:19.384 --> 01:04:21.345]  But the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.565 --> 01:04:25.948]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.188 --> 01:04:33.412]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.672 --> 01:04:36.093]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.253 --> 01:04:37.994]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:55.157 --> 01:04:56.198]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.519 --> 01:04:59.302]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.582 --> 01:05:03.727]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:04.988]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.309 --> 01:05:09.874]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.356 --> 01:05:12.477]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.977 --> 01:05:27.664]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.704 --> 01:05:34.828]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:05:39.810 --> 01:05:43.272]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com Government is best with government leads.
[01:05:56.736 --> 01:05:58.037]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:58.477 --> 01:06:01.198]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:01.619 --> 01:06:04.280]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:11.184]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:06:11.504 --> 01:06:18.908]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at libertystickers.com.

[01:06:32.016 --> 01:06:33.456]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:06:33.637 --> 01:06:33.997]  Have you?
[01:06:34.577 --> 01:06:36.078]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:06:38.459 --> 01:06:42.482]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:06:42.702 --> 01:06:43.242]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:06:46.354 --> 01:06:47.515]  Osama been forgotten.
[01:06:47.955 --> 01:06:51.699]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[01:06:54.481 --> 01:07:00.506]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.106 --> 01:07:04.149]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.931 --> 01:07:12.636]  Last Friday, I talked about cases where prominent members of the community
[01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:17.085]  Because we know the government always pushes around people with criminal records or folks that are poor.
[01:07:18.366 --> 01:07:20.127]  That is more criminal elements than the government did.
[01:07:20.628 --> 01:07:25.212]  But prominent people, you know, you put up a little sign in your yard saying, our judicial system's a joke.
[01:07:25.892 --> 01:07:28.734]  A judge doesn't like it 20 miles away has people come arrest you for it.
[01:07:29.535 --> 01:07:34.019]  Or you hand out a video of a Ron Paul speech on the floor of the house, off C-SPAN.
[01:07:35.039 --> 01:07:41.865]  And you give the state police a copy of that along with one of my videos and they charge you and say it's a terrorist document and try to put you in jail for six years.
[01:07:43.548 --> 01:07:45.809]  Two different charges for two and a half years, so that's not true.
[01:07:45.849 --> 01:07:46.270]  Five years.
[01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:47.391]  Kelly Rushing.
[01:07:47.451 --> 01:07:50.833]  By the way, we reposted that article last Friday when I talked about that.
[01:07:51.654 --> 01:07:53.015]  And the jury found him not guilty.
[01:07:53.075 --> 01:08:00.061]  The point is, the police actually wanted to put Kelly Rushing in Lyon County, Kentucky, in jail.
[01:08:00.221 --> 01:08:01.042]  No criminal record.
[01:08:01.502 --> 01:08:02.663]  Upstanding member of the community.
[01:08:02.703 --> 01:08:04.364]  His family is prominent in the community.
[01:08:04.785 --> 01:08:06.146]  He's a middle-aged gentleman himself.
[01:08:07.487 --> 01:08:09.188]  I mean, even good old boys that are known.
[01:08:09.268 --> 01:08:12.411]  Well, Kelly, you gave us a congressman speech.
[01:08:13.129 --> 01:08:14.469]  Talking about neocons.
[01:08:14.869 --> 01:08:16.270]  You're going to have to go to jail, boy.
[01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:27.852]  Again, it shows a total divorced, separated mindset from reality, from what America is, from what our founding fathers fought for.
[01:08:28.712 --> 01:08:31.212]  I mean, the British didn't do that until the war actually started.
[01:08:31.272 --> 01:08:33.593]  I mean, that is Soviet Union.
[01:08:35.193 --> 01:08:39.954]  But I know of seven cases, because we've documented them, posted them on the website, talked about them.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:41.340]  We're listeners.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:50.803]  People I know personally, in several of the cases, went to InfoWars.com during lunch at Dell Computers, which you're allowed to do.
[01:08:50.863 --> 01:08:53.844]  But no porn, no hacking, no gambling.
[01:08:54.405 --> 01:08:54.725]  What is it?
[01:08:54.765 --> 01:08:57.546]  Porn, hacking, gambling, and hate.
[01:08:58.546 --> 01:08:59.646]  Those are the four categories.
[01:09:00.367 --> 01:09:01.647]  And it's automatically flagged.
[01:09:01.727 --> 01:09:03.288]  And again, what's on my site?
[01:09:03.828 --> 01:09:07.129]  World Net and Daily, New York Times, most of it's mainstream.
[01:09:08.061 --> 01:09:09.503]  And then we write our own articles about it.
[01:09:09.523 --> 01:09:12.286]  We interview a congressman, and then we post what the interview was about.
[01:09:13.247 --> 01:09:19.055]  Bob Barr, last Friday, says Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton, and that he may create martial law and put us in camps.
[01:09:19.075 --> 01:09:20.717]  Basically, that's what Ron Paul said, too.
[01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:25.002]  Okay, I mean, so shoot me, I'm bad.
[01:09:26.597 --> 01:09:28.558]  And Dell Computer will fire you.
[01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:38.703]  You call up, you've got a major firearm company, and you want to buy a computer from Dell, they will not sell it to you, but they've downchanged the policy, at least supposedly in the service, and they will notify Homeland Security on you.
[01:09:40.804 --> 01:09:42.385]  Because guns are illegal, according to them.
[01:09:42.425 --> 01:09:43.246]  They're not illegal.
[01:09:44.867 --> 01:09:47.408]  So they're already changing the mindset.
[01:09:48.426 --> 01:09:50.407]  And we cannot cower to this.
[01:09:50.547 --> 01:09:54.229]  If we cower, if we go along with it, it's over for our society.
[01:09:54.850 --> 01:10:00.653]  The moment we start, oh, we better not talk like that because we'll get fired, is the moment our country's gone.
[01:10:00.673 --> 01:10:08.517]  And I tell you, a hero, and we're going to have him with us for the rest of this hour, the next 50 minutes, and take your calls, is John Gilmore.
[01:10:09.289 --> 01:10:12.793]  We covered this last week, opinions on end of days, Illuminati get man fired.
[01:10:13.234 --> 01:10:16.637]  I learned he just became a recent listener in the last month or so, a few weeks ago.
[01:10:16.657 --> 01:10:19.360]  Interestingly enough, this all kind of happened around the same time.
[01:10:19.821 --> 01:10:21.863]  He'd already been awake for a while.
[01:10:21.903 --> 01:10:23.105]  We're going to talk to him personally.
[01:10:24.346 --> 01:10:28.611]  Headed up the big cable and internet company, the main company there in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[01:10:30.294 --> 01:10:40.917]  He was fired after he repeatedly appeared in local media espousing a belief in the coming apocalypse in a shadowy, all-powerful, secret organization called the Illuminati.
[01:10:41.777 --> 01:10:44.618]  And on Infowars.com, we have two letters he wrote to the media.
[01:10:46.059 --> 01:10:46.699]  Tame stuff.
[01:10:47.839 --> 01:10:52.881]  This is believed by, I'd say, 30% of the American people, and 80% claim they're Christians.
[01:10:53.041 --> 01:10:54.821]  I guess 80% believe this, so they're Christian.
[01:10:55.982 --> 01:10:56.842]  But are they really?
[01:10:57.856 --> 01:11:00.798]  They tried to make him sound like a kook in here, but you can read what he wrote himself.
[01:11:00.918 --> 01:11:03.099]  Very well thought out, very serious.
[01:11:03.439 --> 01:11:06.261]  And they told him, you do one more interview, you're gone.
[01:11:06.361 --> 01:11:08.242]  And he said, I just can't morally do that.
[01:11:08.322 --> 01:11:10.763]  One TV station called him, and so they let him go.
[01:11:10.843 --> 01:11:12.444]  But he says he's a real gentleman.
[01:11:12.864 --> 01:11:15.866]  He's not here to beat up the company that he was the head of locally there.
[01:11:16.767 --> 01:11:17.707]  He's not here to do that.
[01:11:17.727 --> 01:11:19.168]  He's just here to talk about his ideas.
[01:11:19.228 --> 01:11:24.311]  But again, the founding fathers, most of them were wealthy, lost their farms, children.
[01:11:25.143 --> 01:11:33.107]  I mean, reading history of how many founding fathers would be away at war and their son or daughter would die, smallpox, and they weren't there, and they had to go fight a battle the next morning.
[01:11:34.468 --> 01:11:36.629]  Everything we've got is because of sacrifice.
[01:11:37.289 --> 01:11:43.872]  And the mere fact that they're now firing people and arresting people for talking about the New World Order shows we're beginning to hurt them.
[01:11:44.812 --> 01:11:46.113]  Let's now go to our guest.
[01:11:46.133 --> 01:11:47.054]  She's been holding long enough.
[01:11:47.394 --> 01:11:49.895]  John Gilmore, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:11:50.235 --> 01:11:50.595]  Hi, Alex.
[01:11:50.655 --> 01:11:51.976]  Thanks for having me on today.
[01:11:54.122 --> 01:11:59.245]  Tell us about your position for the West Point, Georgia-based cable television and internet access provider.
[01:12:00.045 --> 01:12:02.927]  You were their general manager there in Knoxville.
[01:12:02.947 --> 01:12:03.527]  Tell us about that.
[01:12:04.147 --> 01:12:08.510]  Yeah, I was the general manager for Knowledge here in Knoxville for about five years.
[01:12:09.030 --> 01:12:12.692]  They provide cable phone and internet service to about ten cities in the southeast.
[01:12:14.133 --> 01:12:20.436]  So really what happened, Alex, was about six months ago, like you and I were talking about, I kind of got awoken to a lot of these things.
[01:12:22.034 --> 01:12:26.736]  I've always been kind of an end times Bible scholar.
[01:12:26.776 --> 01:12:28.737]  I was always very interested in it.
[01:12:28.837 --> 01:12:34.379]  When I finally realized, through people like you, I started seeing some things about 9-11 that looked a little strange.
[01:12:34.399 --> 01:12:37.801]  But like most people, or a lot of people at that time, I was kind of blowing it off.
[01:12:37.821 --> 01:12:49.906]  When I really started looking at it myself and researching it, trying to prove you and everybody else wrong, I realized that you were more right than the official government documents and everything that they were throwing out in the media and all that.
[01:12:50.584 --> 01:13:00.519]  And I started relating it to the book of Revelation and realized that this Illuminati group, as you've said many times, really relates dead on to what the Bible tells us is...
[01:13:02.234 --> 01:13:16.946]  Yeah, I mean, it was really, because I've read those things in the Bible, and I always thought, well, that will happen sometime in the future.
[01:13:16.966 --> 01:13:22.090]  And it's really a wake-up call when you realize that, in all likelihood, all these things are going to come to pass in your lifetime.
[01:13:22.110 --> 01:13:30.577]  And it kind of really shook me up to the point where that became the most important thing in my life and no longer did my job or those types, you know, wealth or any of those other things really matter so much.
[01:13:30.597 --> 01:13:31.698]  It was more, you know, it was more important to me.
[01:13:31.898 --> 01:13:35.639]  Doing what I could for God to get the word out to let people know what was really going on.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:41.622]  Well, you know, the Bible says if you know the truth and don't warn people, their blood is on your hands.
[01:13:41.882 --> 01:13:43.382]  And I came across that.
[01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:48.504]  God leads you where you need to be and what you need to read, and I read that.
[01:13:48.784 --> 01:13:55.947]  And as more and more was revealed to me, the more and more I realized I had to do what I could to get the word out like you've been doing.
[01:13:56.801 --> 01:13:58.942]  Well, the good news is, sir, things are changing.
[01:13:58.982 --> 01:14:00.622]  Ten years ago, we were anathema.
[01:14:00.682 --> 01:14:01.822]  Twenty years ago, even more so.
[01:14:01.902 --> 01:14:05.503]  Now, I've likened it to selling snow cones in hell.
[01:14:05.823 --> 01:14:08.184]  People, really, I'm finding, are starting to wake up.
[01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:09.484]  Yeah, they really are.
[01:14:09.504 --> 01:14:12.085]  You know, a lot of people have said some of the things you've talked about, John.
[01:14:12.165 --> 01:14:18.587]  It sounds like, you know, in the days of Noah or Lot or, you know, you keep warning people, warning people, and nobody's really paying attention.
[01:14:18.627 --> 01:14:20.227]  But the difference is, this time around...
[01:14:21.237 --> 01:14:26.601]  Like you've heard, and I know you've got a very big base of listeners, is that people are taking it seriously.
[01:14:27.041 --> 01:14:31.284]  You see the thousands of people in New York protesting during the Republican Convention.
[01:14:32.765 --> 01:14:34.486]  I just saw your 9-11 DVD a couple of days ago.
[01:14:36.959 --> 01:14:49.811]  I mean, it's really been amazing to me that people that have been Christians or have been at one point really devout but have fallen off, this has really wakened a lot of people up and gotten them back into their faith.
[01:14:50.032 --> 01:14:53.535]  And I think that has the establishment really getting scared.
[01:14:53.555 --> 01:14:54.135]  They're nervous.
[01:14:54.416 --> 01:14:57.659]  And I think it's really interesting.
[01:14:58.239 --> 01:15:00.701]  I've seen a couple of unmarked vans that are...
[01:15:02.811 --> 01:15:08.154]  You know, with the tenant windows and the no plates and all that really weird stuff that starts happening.
[01:15:08.174 --> 01:15:16.099]  You read about things like that, but you don't... You know, I've never been harassed or anything, but I just get the sense that once you start getting out there in the public eye, you start being watched.
[01:15:16.419 --> 01:15:17.400]  People start paying attention.
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:19.061]  Well, especially prominent people.
[01:15:19.101 --> 01:15:24.424]  I mean, there's so many congressmen, so many chief economists, so many prominent people.
[01:15:24.444 --> 01:15:27.106]  I mean, Bob Barr said, yeah, they could have martial law.
[01:15:27.126 --> 01:15:28.607]  It looks like that's going to probably happen.
[01:15:29.027 --> 01:15:31.389]  He said Bush is more anti-gun than Clinton.
[01:15:31.429 --> 01:15:31.629]  I mean...
[01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:33.412]  Look, the facts are the facts.
[01:15:33.572 --> 01:15:37.078]  And there are thinking people left, John, people like yourself.
[01:15:37.739 --> 01:15:41.405]  And when it comes down to it, we're going to win this thing in the end with God's help.
[01:15:41.926 --> 01:15:42.908]  And it scares people.
[01:15:42.928 --> 01:15:44.771]  But I've got to tell you, those cops who were sent to...
[01:15:48.535 --> 01:15:51.298]  Yeah.
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:56.103]  Don't accept what I'm telling you just because I'm saying it.
[01:15:56.143 --> 01:15:56.983]  Research it yourself.
[01:15:57.023 --> 01:15:59.846]  That's the only way that I was able to really believe myself.
[01:15:59.926 --> 01:16:02.269]  I mean, everybody needs to look into it, do their own research.
[01:16:02.329 --> 01:16:07.674]  And with the Internet and everything else that's out there, there's much more information at our fingertips than there ever was before.
[01:16:08.375 --> 01:16:09.416]  So there's no reason not to.
[01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:12.792]  Well, I know you don't want to specifically get into it, but I mean, how did all this happen?
[01:16:12.812 --> 01:16:14.313]  You decided to start going public.
[01:16:14.573 --> 01:16:15.713]  Run through that for us, John.
[01:16:15.833 --> 01:16:22.595]  Well, really what happened was, obviously I learned about these things, and I felt like God was telling me, what's the quickest way to get things out there?
[01:16:22.755 --> 01:16:35.480]  So I wrote a letter, and I sent it to my friends and family, which was really tough for me at the time, because I've always been a very quiet, never one to really get out there and give my beliefs publicly.
[01:16:36.027 --> 01:16:40.391]  So I sent it out to my friends and family and that caused a lot of discussion, a lot of good discussion.
[01:16:41.092 --> 01:16:47.477]  Then about a month later I ended up writing a second letter based on some things that were going on in my life and some things that I felt were being revealed to me.
[01:16:48.218 --> 01:16:55.764]  Then I was in an MBA program at UT and one of my friends there was a manager at the local paper.
[01:16:56.245 --> 01:17:00.188]  So I sent it to him about two or three months ago and nothing really happened about it.
[01:17:00.448 --> 01:17:02.050]  So I figured out that life goes on.
[01:17:02.935 --> 01:17:10.681]  And then about the first week in November, he handed it off to an editor who decided they wanted to run a story on it.
[01:17:11.161 --> 01:17:20.708]  So really the way it went that week is that Friday, the first week in November, I was interviewed by a local reporter who then the following Tuesday put it in the paper.
[01:17:20.728 --> 01:17:25.632]  Then that Thursday I was on the local news, 6 o'clock news broadcast.
[01:17:26.112 --> 01:17:31.356]  Then Friday morning I was on a local popular radio station in Atlanta.
[01:17:31.872 --> 01:17:32.273]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:17:47.381 --> 01:17:56.524]  Well, the AP's comment on this is that you were fired, but I guess they just said you can't work here because you're doing this, and you just said, okay, I resign.
[01:17:56.584 --> 01:17:56.784]  That's it.
[01:17:56.804 --> 01:17:57.384]  How nice of you.
[01:17:57.404 --> 01:18:00.305]  Yeah, well, I didn't want to turn it into this me versus them thing.
[01:18:00.325 --> 01:18:00.485]  I wanted...
[01:18:05.566 --> 01:18:12.092]  I wanted to make sure that people understood that the whole reason I was doing this was to get the information out there, and I felt like God was calling me to do that.
[01:18:12.152 --> 01:18:14.535]  When we get back, I want to hear how this progressed.
[01:18:15.315 --> 01:18:19.520]  I've only seen a few of the news articles, how they tried to make you, in a way, sound kooky.
[01:18:21.441 --> 01:18:29.489]  It was done subtly, but I want to see if you agree with that take I have, because you've seen the whole of the reportage, so you've got a more balanced view on it.
[01:18:29.509 --> 01:18:30.030]  Stay with us.
[01:18:30.610 --> 01:18:35.313]  And then coming up the next segment after that, folks, I'm going to just throw some news items out at John and get his take on it.
[01:18:35.693 --> 01:18:36.754]  And we'll also take your calls.
[01:18:36.794 --> 01:18:37.775]  And we've got loaded phones.

[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:50.263]  Well, supposedly 80% of America's Christian, are they going to fire 80% of us?
[01:18:54.486 --> 01:18:55.946]  Here it is, folks.
[01:18:55.966 --> 01:18:56.787]  The 2006 Red Book.

[01:20:57.297 --> 01:21:02.062]  Did you know that the Bible forecast signs to let us know that we're in the last days?
[01:21:02.683 --> 01:21:09.410]  The book of Revelation says that world travel quickly and efficiently would be one sign and also knowledge would increase.

[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:00.004]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[01:22:01.175 --> 01:22:09.063]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[01:22:09.303 --> 01:22:11.925]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'

[01:22:20.674 --> 01:22:23.677]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[01:22:24.017 --> 01:22:24.517]  We're good to go.
[01:22:54.079 --> 01:22:56.820]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:56.840 --> 01:23:00.742]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:06.165 --> 01:23:07.206]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:23:07.806 --> 01:23:09.227]  We're talking to John Gilmore.
[01:23:10.647 --> 01:23:15.670]  He headed up the major cable and internet company in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[01:23:15.690 --> 01:23:16.530]  He was general manager.
[01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:23.074]  And they basically told him to leave if he kept talking about the One World Government and the Illuminati and 9-11.
[01:23:25.255 --> 01:23:31.719]  John, how many TV shows, how many radio shows, how many news articles were written in the last few weeks about this?
[01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:36.843]  Alex, I would say probably, I know a Memphis paper picked it up.
[01:23:37.183 --> 01:23:40.546]  I actually got a call from a woman in Las Vegas who saw it out there.
[01:23:40.606 --> 01:23:44.409]  So I'd say anywhere from five to six articles that I know about.
[01:23:45.089 --> 01:23:50.613]  And the local CBS affiliate had a news segment twice.
[01:23:50.873 --> 01:23:51.734]  How did they frame it?
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:53.440]  They framed it.
[01:23:53.580 --> 01:23:56.022]  Actually, it wasn't as negative as I originally thought.
[01:23:56.042 --> 01:24:02.868]  I was pretty prepared for being called kind of kooky, but it actually was very serious.
[01:24:02.948 --> 01:24:13.798]  When I was on the radio in Atlanta during drive time, they put me on for probably about 15 minutes during some of the biggest travel time in Atlanta.
[01:24:13.878 --> 01:24:14.899]  It was all very serious.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.762]  I think people, when you talk to them about this, when they really start looking at it,
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:20.941]  There's no joking.
[01:24:21.401 --> 01:24:34.850]  There's no negative because when you tell people, okay, go find a plane to hit the Pentagon and nobody can anywhere, people start scratching their head and then they start asking you more questions instead of just immediately trying to shoot you down.
[01:24:35.973 --> 01:24:40.534]  Well, there's a lot of other facets to 9-11, like why did Larry Silverstein say he blew up Building 7?
[01:24:40.574 --> 01:24:42.895]  Why were there blast points going off?
[01:24:42.955 --> 01:24:44.735]  Why did it collapse as a controlled demolition?
[01:24:45.055 --> 01:24:48.136]  Why did public officials get calls not to fly to New York the night before?
[01:24:48.436 --> 01:24:55.778]  Yeah, I mean, you mentioned the San Francisco mayor got a call on September 10th not to fly to New York the next day.
[01:24:57.538 --> 01:25:10.921]  When you really start reading about these things and telling people about them, initially some people may give you a little grief about it, but I can't tell you how many people have come back to me within a week or two and very serious when they were kind of joking when I first talked to them.
[01:25:11.322 --> 01:25:16.563]  Very serious and they were like, this kind of changes your whole perspective on what reality is right now and it really does.
[01:25:17.150 --> 01:25:25.091]  When you realize that your government isn't really protecting you and your military is controlled by those same people, it's a sobering fact to learn.
[01:25:25.351 --> 01:25:26.152]  Well, that's the thing.
[01:25:26.172 --> 01:25:30.552]  I'm not against the individual trips or some nice ones trying to help people.
[01:25:30.632 --> 01:25:32.273]  It's that it's built on a lie.
[01:25:32.333 --> 01:25:33.733]  We're there over a lie.
[01:25:34.493 --> 01:25:38.074]  And then at the same time, they want to go into even more countries.
[01:25:38.474 --> 01:25:46.295]  Yeah, we're just all being deceived to the point... You know, and the Bible tells us that during the end times, the level of deception is going to be huge.
[01:25:46.883 --> 01:25:49.125]  And then many are going to be deceived.
[01:25:49.325 --> 01:25:51.107]  It's both our military people and the military.
[01:25:51.187 --> 01:25:51.687]  It's me.
[01:25:51.887 --> 01:25:55.350]  It's everybody that goes about their daily lives.
[01:25:55.871 --> 01:25:58.152]  You're working hard and you think you're providing well for your family.
[01:25:58.212 --> 01:26:02.656]  All the while, there's this evil influence throughout the world that's growing more powerful.
[01:26:04.258 --> 01:26:04.778]  It's sobering.
[01:26:04.818 --> 01:26:06.479]  It really is sobering when you find that out.
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:10.863]  Initially, it's depressing, but then you get this resolve like you want to do something about it.
[01:26:10.903 --> 01:26:12.024]  Well, what are you doing now?
[01:26:13.990 --> 01:26:18.514]  I mean, what are you going to do financially now that you don't have your general manager job?
[01:26:18.995 --> 01:26:22.778]  Well, fortunately, I think the Lord's going to build up my finances.
[01:26:23.319 --> 01:26:26.181]  I'm not one of those people who's living paycheck to paycheck.
[01:26:27.062 --> 01:26:35.810]  I just got an MBA at the University of Tennessee, and depending on how things go over the next few weeks, my plan is to find another source of income in January.
[01:26:36.753 --> 01:26:39.795]  So, I don't really, I'm not really fretting over that too much.
[01:26:40.015 --> 01:26:41.437]  You know, they told you to leave, though.
[01:26:41.457 --> 01:26:49.522]  It's funny that supposedly most Christians believe George Bush is basically Jesus and that everything's fine and still in bones is Christian.
[01:26:50.603 --> 01:26:51.884]  And they don't believe in world government.
[01:26:51.904 --> 01:26:54.026]  Within the Bible, all it talks about is world government.
[01:26:54.646 --> 01:26:55.947]  I mean, how do they square that?
[01:26:55.988 --> 01:27:06.297]  How do they say, you're fired or you have to resign because you're talking about a one-world government, but then that's the view of, supposedly, it should be the view of 80% of the American people.
[01:27:06.798 --> 01:27:09.920]  Yeah, I think the problem is a lot of people are like me.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:17.948]  I consider myself a Christian, but you always think that all those things always happen in the future and that a one-world government will come, but it's just not going to come in my lifetime.
[01:27:18.656 --> 01:27:26.558]  And I think what I've found, and I think a lot of people are finding out now, is that most likely it is going to happen during our lifetime a lot sooner than we originally thought.
[01:27:27.319 --> 01:27:34.421]  And while the people that I work for at Nology, I know for a fact a couple of them are seriously looking into these things.
[01:27:34.701 --> 01:27:36.801]  They obviously don't believe in it as much as I do.
[01:27:39.242 --> 01:27:45.764]  But I think what you're going to see, Alex, is over the next year or two, I think you're going to see more and more people really starting to understand what's going on today.
[01:27:47.174 --> 01:27:53.638]  And hopefully people that really get the word out like me aren't fired for things like this.
[01:27:53.798 --> 01:27:56.779]  Well, there's a saying that I've beaten to the ground.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:28:06.965]  Mark Twain quote, In the beginning a patriot is a scarce man hated and feared and scorned, but in time when his cause succeeds the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:28:07.245 --> 01:28:07.445]  Right.
[01:28:07.965 --> 01:28:10.968]  Well, you know, and the thing is, if I hadn't been fired, would I be on your show?
[01:28:11.028 --> 01:28:12.910]  Would I have gotten as much media attention?
[01:28:13.271 --> 01:28:15.733]  And the focus needs to be on what's happening.
[01:28:15.833 --> 01:28:16.834]  It's not me.
[01:28:17.235 --> 01:28:24.822]  You know, I'm one part of it, but it needs to be focused on what's going on, God's plan for us, and what's going on according to the book of Revelation and how it all relates.
[01:28:25.042 --> 01:28:28.626]  Well, I want to come back and take calls, and they'll be all over the map at the time.
[01:28:29.791 --> 01:28:32.293]  This is the map we're talking about, the New World War program.
[01:28:32.594 --> 01:28:37.378]  I want to talk about specifically some of the things you wrote in these letters that we posted on InfoWars.com.
[01:28:37.398 --> 01:28:40.500]  I want to go over where you see things going.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:41.441]  I want to get your view on that.
[01:28:43.643 --> 01:28:44.524]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.024 --> 01:28:46.626]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.546 --> 01:28:50.229]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.889 --> 01:28:56.230]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.491 --> 01:29:00.333]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:29:00.653 --> 01:29:01.454]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.894 --> 01:29:06.016]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:06.236 --> 01:29:10.419]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.799 --> 01:29:15.682]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:16.062 --> 01:29:19.604]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.824 --> 01:29:25.167]  It's all-natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra-virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:25.448 --> 01:29:28.169]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:28.469 --> 01:29:29.370]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:29.670 --> 01:29:30.250]  Call now.
[01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:30.310]  1-800-
[01:29:31.451 --> 01:29:33.252]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[01:29:53.795 --> 01:29:57.378]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:29:57.418 --> 01:29:57.919]  are located?
[01:29:58.119 --> 01:30:01.522]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:30:01.743 --> 01:30:06.447]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:30:06.727 --> 01:30:11.732]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:30:11.912 --> 01:30:12.553]  We're good to go.
[01:30:32.173 --> 01:30:34.454]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[01:30:34.474 --> 01:30:35.634]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[01:30:58.277 --> 01:31:11.911]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals, and we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[01:31:12.792 --> 01:31:17.357]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[01:31:17.952 --> 01:31:22.674]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[01:31:23.195 --> 01:31:41.823]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.libertydollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:31:42.384 --> 01:31:47.186]  That's www.libertydollar.org or call toll-free...
[01:31:47.654 --> 01:32:15.176]  888-421-6181 I got a star on my car and one on my chest A gun on my hip and the right to arrest I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way If you break the law, you'll hear from me, I know
[01:32:16.056 --> 01:32:26.759]  Alright, we're back live, folks.
[01:32:26.859 --> 01:32:31.400]  Let me just share this with John Gilmore, who I just really appreciate.
[01:32:32.001 --> 01:32:35.041]  I always talk about how more prominent people need to go public.
[01:32:35.702 --> 01:32:40.963]  I mean, I've talked on the hike and bike trail to the former Speaker of the House here in Texas.
[01:32:42.205 --> 01:32:43.746]  Who's now a gigantic lobbyist.
[01:32:43.806 --> 01:32:45.888]  And he goes, Alex, I know all about the New World Order.
[01:32:45.908 --> 01:32:47.109]  Hell, we all watch your show.
[01:32:47.129 --> 01:32:49.050]  We know that's how things really are.
[01:32:49.110 --> 01:32:50.912]  And it's all happening.
[01:32:50.952 --> 01:32:52.633]  But, you know, we don't like it.
[01:32:52.673 --> 01:32:56.796]  But you've just got to try to be part of it to be able to survive it.
[01:32:57.536 --> 01:33:00.879]  Or these other good old boys will sit there and make jokes when I talk to them.
[01:33:00.939 --> 01:33:02.800]  Or I see them when I'm out fishing or something.
[01:33:04.001 --> 01:33:05.843]  You know, back at a restaurant or something on the lake.
[01:33:07.104 --> 01:33:08.765]  Once a month when I take off a few hours.
[01:33:09.762 --> 01:33:12.143]  And I've talked to other prominent people.
[01:33:12.223 --> 01:33:15.904]  I've talked to just a lot of folks that are in the government, out of the government.
[01:33:16.884 --> 01:33:20.285]  I mean, I've talked to people high level in the Democratic Party, Republican Party.
[01:33:20.305 --> 01:33:21.745]  You know I'm not a name dropper, folks.
[01:33:21.985 --> 01:33:23.005]  But I know a lot of people.
[01:33:23.766 --> 01:33:25.046]  And they all know it.
[01:33:26.486 --> 01:33:28.367]  Could we get congressman after congressman?
[01:33:28.387 --> 01:33:37.189]  Could we get former German defense ministers and members of the Blair government on to say there's a one world government and they're setting up martial law and they're going to enslave us and take our guns?
[01:33:38.633 --> 01:33:39.654]  Bob Barr last week.
[01:33:41.095 --> 01:33:43.577]  The point is, is this stuff's really happening.
[01:33:45.819 --> 01:33:49.742]  And the way I woke up is I was going to the local university here in Austin.
[01:33:51.924 --> 01:33:56.988]  And they were teaching me America was bad, world government was good, guns were evil, the family was evil.
[01:33:57.748 --> 01:34:02.492]  And then I'd go turn on the news and they were going, there's kooks and evil people that believe in a one world government.
[01:34:02.932 --> 01:34:03.693]  And they're bad.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:10.581]  And there were all these government documents on it, and I was always a big reader of the news, and I thought, wait a minute, I'm being taught world government's good.
[01:34:10.961 --> 01:34:12.922]  This is 12 years ago, 13 years ago.
[01:34:13.722 --> 01:34:15.622]  I guess I started waking up really about 14 years ago.
[01:34:16.363 --> 01:34:18.783]  But really waking up there in my last couple years of college.
[01:34:19.763 --> 01:34:22.144]  And I thought, this is crazy.
[01:34:22.704 --> 01:34:28.485]  I mean, they're teaching me one world government, but then if I'm for it, world government exists and is good.
[01:34:28.525 --> 01:34:31.706]  But the minute I say it's bad, it doesn't exist and I'm insane.
[01:34:33.522 --> 01:34:40.684]  And again, we have footage of Abby Newman, pulled over, side of the road, naval veteran, no criminal record, pocket constitution, one of my videos, cops take her to jail.
[01:34:41.044 --> 01:34:44.104]  They're on their own squad car video, going, these videos may be illegal.
[01:34:45.025 --> 01:34:47.365]  Just anything that says the government might be bad is illegal.
[01:34:47.685 --> 01:34:49.646]  They don't believe it's America anymore.
[01:34:49.946 --> 01:34:51.586]  How did they get so brainwashed?
[01:34:51.626 --> 01:34:52.866]  It was like overnight.
[01:34:53.987 --> 01:34:59.388]  I mean, just 10, 20 years ago, people knew that cops arresting you for your political views was the Soviet Union.
[01:35:00.575 --> 01:35:01.496]  It is in America.
[01:35:02.016 --> 01:35:05.800]  And so I woke up just because they were openly pushing world government.
[01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:09.282]  This stuff is not hidden, but we have a general public.
[01:35:10.463 --> 01:35:15.448]  I played that clip from Australian TV of them interviewing Americans on the street where they go, where's Iran?
[01:35:15.488 --> 01:35:16.569]  They think it's Australia.
[01:35:16.789 --> 01:35:17.730]  Who do you want to attack?
[01:35:17.770 --> 01:35:18.490]  Seven countries.
[01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:18.730]  Who?
[01:35:18.810 --> 01:35:19.711]  I don't know their names.
[01:35:19.751 --> 01:35:20.772]  Just kill them all.
[01:35:21.833 --> 01:35:22.934]  You don't know their names.
[01:35:22.954 --> 01:35:24.155]  You just want to kill them all.
[01:35:24.907 --> 01:35:29.510]  I mean, the Nazis weren't that overtly running around thumbing at the mouth.
[01:35:29.530 --> 01:35:31.151]  They at least knew who they were trying to kill.
[01:35:32.092 --> 01:35:33.033]  The Soviets knew.
[01:35:33.473 --> 01:35:37.115]  America, it is like it is a palsy of evil.
[01:35:37.836 --> 01:35:40.998]  Just a seizing of everyone that has taken place.
[01:35:41.578 --> 01:35:42.779]  And it's getting worse and worse.
[01:35:42.819 --> 01:35:43.640]  And I know I'm ranting.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:45.661]  Do you have any comments on what I was just saying, John?
[01:35:46.802 --> 01:35:49.904]  No, I agree with a lot of what you're saying there, Alex.
[01:35:49.964 --> 01:35:50.765]  I think a lot of people...
[01:35:51.816 --> 01:36:01.225]  They'll talk about the one world government and things that are going on, but as soon as you start giving a negative view of it, you do tend to get a lot of flack.
[01:36:01.466 --> 01:36:02.647]  That's just the way it works right now.
[01:36:04.545 --> 01:36:07.065]  Well, where do you see all this going?
[01:36:07.085 --> 01:36:14.907]  I've read over much of the two lengthy letters you wrote, and we've posted them, but how do you see this playing out?
[01:36:15.247 --> 01:36:19.968]  When did you click and go, this is the Antichrist beast world government system that I'm looking at?
[01:36:19.988 --> 01:36:22.068]  It was probably about five or six months ago.
[01:36:22.428 --> 01:36:31.270]  It was probably about five or six months ago when I really started looking at a lot of these things and doing a lot of research on my own, doing a lot of Bible study, and realized that
[01:36:31.730 --> 01:36:33.514]  It's not just the book of Revelation.
[01:36:33.534 --> 01:36:37.921]  In the New Testament it talks about a lot of signs that you're entering the last days.
[01:36:38.663 --> 01:36:41.668]  The more I looked around, I just realized that we are in those times.
[01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:44.653]  What's going to happen in the future?
[01:36:45.359 --> 01:36:47.421]  You know, that's a difficult thing to say.
[01:36:47.441 --> 01:36:53.446]  I mean, I know people in Knoxville know that I thought that something was going to happen on November 11th of this year.
[01:36:54.307 --> 01:36:57.730]  And I still feel something pretty horrible is going to happen in this country.
[01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:59.371]  And it could happen, I think it's imminent.
[01:37:00.673 --> 01:37:06.538]  But what I think is going to happen, I think you're going to see some type of a terrorist, again, some type of terrorist attack on multiple cities.
[01:37:08.206 --> 01:37:10.868]  That basically takes us out of our prominence.
[01:37:10.888 --> 01:37:18.875]  I think most scholars of the New World Government and New World Order, when you read the book of Revelation and the New Testament, realize that
[01:37:19.597 --> 01:37:31.500]  For Bible prophecy to come to pass, most people believe, and I believe with them, that the European Union must rise and we must decline as a power.
[01:37:31.980 --> 01:37:33.681]  And I think that's one of the things that's going to happen.
[01:37:33.861 --> 01:37:34.601]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:37:34.641 --> 01:37:38.682]  There's been lots of dates we hear about and lots of times that globalists could launch operations.
[01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:47.405]  By exposing their problem-reaction-solution paradigm of thinking, we can get a reprieve to wake even more people up.
[01:37:47.445 --> 01:38:00.850]  When you see the abortion numbers dropping, when you see 70% of youth being against abortion, those numbers switching, when you see all these people now, people are repenting, people are saying no to a lot of things.
[01:38:00.870 --> 01:38:02.411]  You're not going to hear that on the nightly news, though.
[01:38:02.911 --> 01:38:05.892]  I think we've already been given reprieves, my friend.
[01:38:06.533 --> 01:38:08.055]  Yeah, I think there's some of that.
[01:38:08.236 --> 01:38:11.321]  I think that's one of the reasons I was on the air in Atlanta that day.
[01:38:11.341 --> 01:38:14.947]  They happened to put me on on November 11th, the day that I thought something was going to happen.
[01:38:16.044 --> 01:38:18.905]  I think that's what God is giving us all a test of some type.
[01:38:18.925 --> 01:38:22.646]  I don't know all of it, but I do know there's a test of faith out there.
[01:38:22.666 --> 01:38:24.587]  9-11 happening is a warning.
[01:38:24.647 --> 01:38:27.768]  A lot of people would say, well, I'm not so sure that's a warning from God.
[01:38:27.788 --> 01:38:30.129]  I'm not sure about all these things that are going on.
[01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:35.471]  But when you see our weather, basically we had a city destroyed this year.
[01:38:35.791 --> 01:38:38.612]  Really start thinking about that.
[01:38:38.652 --> 01:38:44.774]  These things won't happen in the Bible for countries that have fallen away from him and that have followed evil or
[01:38:45.927 --> 01:38:47.968]  All the things that Satan throws at us.
[01:38:48.008 --> 01:38:55.732]  Well, what happens is God lifts his hedge of protection, and then the devilish forces swoop in to carry out their programs.
[01:38:55.772 --> 01:38:58.453]  But even their program is all part of the grand design.
[01:38:58.833 --> 01:39:00.114]  Yeah, it is.
[01:39:01.394 --> 01:39:06.517]  We can talk about the one world government and fighting against it, but the book of Revelation says it does happen.
[01:39:07.557 --> 01:39:11.980]  I think our goal, Alex, is to get the word out to as many people as we can.
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:16.382]  Christians and non-Christians bring as many people to our Heavenly Father as we can.
[01:39:16.422 --> 01:39:23.226]  And those that may have fallen away from their faith, hopefully this is something that gets them back focused on God again.
[01:39:23.266 --> 01:39:25.367]  Because all these things are happening for a reason.
[01:39:25.607 --> 01:39:26.568]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:39:26.808 --> 01:39:30.210]  I have a secular radio show, but I don't make a secret of the fact that I'm a Christian.
[01:39:30.250 --> 01:39:33.992]  But regardless, even if you're a criminologist...
[01:39:34.632 --> 01:39:38.953]  I mean, I had two articles last week of men abducting children to kill them in sacrifices.
[01:39:39.634 --> 01:39:41.214]  Those were mainstream news articles.
[01:39:41.254 --> 01:39:42.855]  This is going on in America.
[01:39:43.415 --> 01:39:45.515]  Why do so many psychopaths believe in the devil?
[01:39:45.876 --> 01:39:48.977]  Why do so many psychopaths have delusions they're doing it for Satan?
[01:39:49.577 --> 01:39:53.238]  Why do elites throughout history worship horn gods and commit sacrifices?
[01:39:53.919 --> 01:40:01.589]  Why is R. Lee going to Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones in their own autobiographies saying that they're engaging in druidic rites?
[01:40:02.130 --> 01:40:03.612]  Because they believe in it.
[01:40:03.632 --> 01:40:09.200]  There's spiritual warfare going on, and you're either on one side or the other, and if you're not doing anything, then...
[01:40:09.693 --> 01:40:14.316]  You know, Jesus told us, you're not on his side if you're just kind of on the sidelines watching.
[01:40:14.336 --> 01:40:15.257]  It's actually worse.
[01:40:15.377 --> 01:40:16.198]  It's actually worse.
[01:40:16.218 --> 01:40:17.579]  You get spit out of his mouth.
[01:40:17.779 --> 01:40:18.219]  Oh, yeah.
[01:40:19.340 --> 01:40:20.841]  And most people don't realize it.
[01:40:20.941 --> 01:40:26.585]  And I notice you've got some Matrix references on your website, Alex, and I think that's true.
[01:40:26.845 --> 01:40:28.206]  And I talk about that a little bit.
[01:40:28.226 --> 01:40:29.367]  I've talked to some friends about that.
[01:40:29.647 --> 01:40:31.569]  You're born into a world at war, but you don't know it.
[01:40:32.105 --> 01:40:32.465]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:58.761 --> 01:41:06.346]  You know, but like you said many times in just the time we've been talking here, you know, you've got to stand up for it and you've got to make some sacrifices for it.
[01:41:06.366 --> 01:41:15.812]  You know, that's one thing the Bible says is that as a true Christian you're going to make sacrifices, you're going to be persecuted, but God expects us to stand up for him and that's what he told me.
[01:41:15.832 --> 01:41:20.575]  Well, you know, I personally was told to stop talking about Waco Massacre.
[01:41:21.495 --> 01:41:24.856]  I was told to stop talking about the urban warfare martial law drills.
[01:41:25.396 --> 01:41:28.297]  I was interviewing police chiefs who'd thrown the army out of their town.
[01:41:28.357 --> 01:41:29.617]  It wasn't like I was out on my own.
[01:41:29.637 --> 01:41:30.458]  Oh, really?
[01:41:30.798 --> 01:41:34.319]  Yeah, and this was back in 1999.
[01:41:34.379 --> 01:41:35.999]  I was told, shut up or you're fired.
[01:41:36.039 --> 01:41:41.961]  It was even in the paper that I had the highest talk radio ratings in that time slot of the four talk stations.
[01:41:42.561 --> 01:41:44.461]  I got a lot of advertising money.
[01:41:44.501 --> 01:41:48.102]  My little show was bringing in a lot of money for the local station.
[01:41:48.582 --> 01:41:50.723]  And they just said, shut up or you're fired.
[01:41:50.763 --> 01:41:53.023]  And they got off on firing me.
[01:41:53.543 --> 01:42:00.604]  And I'm not glad to hear this, but the people that fired me basically are the equivalent of dishwashers today.
[01:42:00.624 --> 01:42:02.965]  And I'm reaching 500 times that number.
[01:42:03.805 --> 01:42:06.365]  And I was happy to be fired.
[01:42:06.626 --> 01:42:09.106]  As soon as that happened, though, so many other doors opened.
[01:42:09.747 --> 01:42:11.868]  Yeah.
[01:42:12.388 --> 01:42:14.089]  That was the choice that I had.
[01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:22.173]  If I had said, no, I'm going to stay where I'm at and not get fired and stop talking about these things, then what is it?
[01:42:22.973 --> 01:42:27.816]  I'm just making some money, living a life all the while, this evil thing is going on.
[01:42:27.836 --> 01:42:29.577]  I just felt like it was time for me to get in the game.
[01:42:29.637 --> 01:42:32.658]  I felt like that's what God was telling me to do and that's what I've done.
[01:42:32.698 --> 01:42:36.040]  Because of that, a lot of people have probably heard about these things that otherwise wouldn't
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:41.825]  Your next letter ought to be about all these phony Christians telling us again that George Bush is somehow this divine creature.
[01:43:00.160 --> 01:43:01.140]  That's something I've looked at.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:04.941]  I voted for Bush twice before I really started looking into these things.
[01:43:05.702 --> 01:43:14.905]  I would tell anybody who's still on the fence about that, I know it's a very difficult thing to come into, but you've got to look at how is he living his life and what decisions he's making.
[01:43:14.945 --> 01:43:17.846]  Not what he's saying, but what he's doing, because that's what Jesus tells us to do.
[01:43:18.347 --> 01:43:23.108]  He's run up more debt for this country than anybody in the history of this country.
[01:43:23.548 --> 01:43:24.669]  Is he really a humble person?
[01:43:26.228 --> 01:43:30.212]  You know, he fires people that aren't on board with him completely.
[01:43:30.693 --> 01:43:32.454]  It seems like he steamrolls a lot of people.
[01:43:33.235 --> 01:43:34.276]  He's sanctioned torture.
[01:43:34.877 --> 01:43:36.238]  We've invaded other countries.
[01:43:36.739 --> 01:43:43.025]  And most of all, what really stood out to me, and this was the kicker for me, was I really looked into skull and bones like I know you have.
[01:43:43.466 --> 01:43:46.689]  And the satanic rituals that are a part of that
[01:43:47.049 --> 01:43:50.516]  There's no way anybody who's a Christian could be any way associated with those things.
[01:43:50.976 --> 01:43:58.230]  So in the end, that along with all the things that happened on 9-11 led me to believe that I just can't trust the man anymore.
[01:43:59.102 --> 01:43:59.662]  Well, didn't they?
[01:43:59.922 --> 01:44:05.105]  I've had national Christian talk show hosts accuse me of being the devil for exposing skull and bones.
[01:44:05.125 --> 01:44:09.467]  I mean, just as early as five years ago, it didn't exist, and I was making it up.
[01:44:09.627 --> 01:44:15.330]  Now they say, oh, that was when he was a 22-year-old man, 21-year-old man.
[01:44:15.370 --> 01:44:16.430]  He isn't part of it now.
[01:44:16.911 --> 01:44:17.711]  But then he won't.
[01:44:17.871 --> 01:44:22.733]  He says it's so secret he can't talk about it, and he goes to Bohemian Grove where they worship Moloch.
[01:44:22.753 --> 01:44:23.934]  Oh, yeah, I've read about that, too.
[01:44:23.974 --> 01:44:25.855]  I realize you've done some research into that, too.
[01:44:25.915 --> 01:44:26.695]  And they do that.
[01:44:26.715 --> 01:44:28.096]  They do that, what, once a year or...
[01:44:28.716 --> 01:44:29.296]  Yeah, once a year.
[01:44:29.537 --> 01:44:31.097]  Once a year they go out there.
[01:44:31.478 --> 01:44:37.761]  And to me, what's more important, your faith in God and your Christian beliefs, or this secret satanic society, if you're not going to talk about it?
[01:44:37.781 --> 01:44:39.322]  Well, I mean, give me a break, folks.
[01:44:40.602 --> 01:44:47.066]  I mean, it's like, should we, like Bush, he says he's Christian, but he also goes to a devil worship session.
[01:44:47.506 --> 01:44:49.807]  Well, maybe, I mean, it's so obvious.
[01:44:49.847 --> 01:44:53.849]  His real religion, and again, folks, that's the point for atheists out there.
[01:44:53.869 --> 01:44:55.010]  You may not believe in God.
[01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:56.671]  The point is, they do.
[01:44:57.071 --> 01:44:57.271]  Yeah.
[01:44:57.951 --> 01:45:00.614]  I mean, I've had atheists go, I don't get into that because I don't believe in that.
[01:45:00.874 --> 01:45:01.875]  Regardless, they do.
[01:45:01.915 --> 01:45:03.496]  I mean, do you see the point I'm trying to make?
[01:45:03.516 --> 01:45:06.538]  That the elite, this is what governs them.
[01:45:06.759 --> 01:45:09.361]  We have to look at it just from a sociological point of view.
[01:45:09.681 --> 01:45:10.762]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:45:11.463 --> 01:45:11.883]  Absolutely.
[01:45:11.923 --> 01:45:22.212]  I mean, and what bothers me is that, you know, people at high levels of government will tell you what you want to hear to get elected to do the things that they want to do when, in fact, there's other reasons for it, you know.
[01:45:24.404 --> 01:45:28.126]  And the whole Bohemian thing out there, was it Sonoma Valley, I think?
[01:45:28.527 --> 01:45:28.807]  Yes.
[01:45:29.087 --> 01:45:38.793]  I mean, that's a really, really scary thing when you realize some of the high-level guys and your officials in your government are going to things like that.
[01:45:39.173 --> 01:45:40.835]  I mean, because that's just pure evil stuff.
[01:45:41.515 --> 01:45:50.981]  I mean, those types of things are really what woke me up and led me to believe that we're in those times where Satan is going more powerful in the world and is controlling more people.
[01:45:51.893 --> 01:45:53.354]  At the highest levels of our government.
[01:45:53.815 --> 01:45:54.835]  I agree.
[01:45:54.855 --> 01:45:55.656]  Let's take some calls.
[01:45:55.756 --> 01:45:58.118]  Pat and then Dave and Don and Ray and Fred.
[01:45:58.158 --> 01:45:58.838]  Pat in Ohio.
[01:45:58.858 --> 01:45:59.379]  Go ahead, Pat.
[01:46:00.079 --> 01:46:00.920]  Yes.
[01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:02.501]  I have a question for your guests.
[01:46:03.301 --> 01:46:04.602]  Hello to both of you, first of all.
[01:46:06.123 --> 01:46:06.584]  Hi.
[01:46:06.984 --> 01:46:11.367]  President Bush, some people are saying, like you were saying earlier, he's not in it anymore.
[01:46:11.387 --> 01:46:14.069]  I talked to you a few weeks ago.
[01:46:14.790 --> 01:46:18.373]  Alex, when you say that he's no longer... Well, I was saying people say that.
[01:46:18.653 --> 01:46:19.514]  That's not true.
[01:46:19.534 --> 01:46:20.515]  He is involved.
[01:46:20.835 --> 01:46:21.195]  Right.
[01:46:21.235 --> 01:46:24.478]  He's appointed 12 members of Skull and Bones to high-level positions.
[01:46:27.100 --> 01:46:28.081]  Okay.
[01:46:28.101 --> 01:46:31.083]  But he's not going to Bohemian anymore.
[01:46:31.404 --> 01:46:31.784]  No, no.
[01:46:32.064 --> 01:46:34.426]  He doesn't go... They never go while they're president.
[01:46:34.646 --> 01:46:34.766]  Right.
[01:46:34.826 --> 01:46:34.926]  Okay.
[01:46:34.946 --> 01:46:41.592]  That's what I want to... And that's basically the question I had.
[01:46:44.125 --> 01:46:45.006]  Is he still going?
[01:46:45.106 --> 01:46:45.966]  Well, Bush Sr.
[01:46:46.006 --> 01:46:48.208]  didn't go while he was president, and he did the year after.
[01:46:48.268 --> 01:46:50.969]  They don't go because that will draw too much attention to it.
[01:46:51.049 --> 01:46:51.169]  No.
[01:46:53.121 --> 01:46:53.901]  Thanks for the call, Pat.
[01:46:53.921 --> 01:46:55.262]  You want to comment on that, John?
[01:46:55.962 --> 01:46:57.103]  No, I think you're dead on.
[01:46:57.603 --> 01:46:59.484]  That's all the things that I've researched as well.
[01:47:00.144 --> 01:47:10.949]  I think what's been amazing to me, and you mentioned Bush Sr., is that even when the tsunami hit earlier, there was George Bush giving a press conference talking about the current president.
[01:47:11.289 --> 01:47:13.210]  And then in the background, you had George Sr.
[01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:15.251]  and Bill Clinton just kind of standing there.
[01:47:16.091 --> 01:47:19.373]  And they've been kind of prominent, but nobody ever really says what they're doing.
[01:47:20.060 --> 01:47:21.421]  That's kind of bothered me a little bit.
[01:47:21.461 --> 01:47:23.623]  Well, sucking that money into their big fat money house.
[01:47:23.643 --> 01:47:29.667]  Yeah, you know, it's like somebody else is pulling the strings behind the scenes and kind of keeping them in the forefront for some reason, which I haven't figured out yet.
[01:47:30.208 --> 01:47:31.369]  Dave in California.
[01:47:31.389 --> 01:47:32.249]  You're on the air, Dave.
[01:47:32.549 --> 01:47:33.070]  Hey, Alex.
[01:47:33.110 --> 01:47:34.051]  Long time no see.
[01:47:34.211 --> 01:47:34.531]  Hi.
[01:47:34.631 --> 01:47:36.212]  This is Northern California.
[01:47:36.392 --> 01:47:39.875]  And Mr. Gilmore, I salute you for giving up a high position.
[01:47:40.115 --> 01:47:42.177]  That puts you in a pretty rare bunch of people.
[01:47:42.737 --> 01:47:43.117]  Thank you, sir.
[01:47:43.157 --> 01:47:43.638]  Appreciate it.
[01:47:43.658 --> 01:47:44.398]  That's all right.
[01:47:44.418 --> 01:47:45.239]  Keep up the good work.
[01:47:45.819 --> 01:47:46.680]  I just have one question.
[01:47:48.137 --> 01:47:55.906]  For both of you, and that's about the ongoing child abduction type stuff.
[01:47:56.006 --> 01:48:00.451]  And what I'm particularly interested in right now is Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:48:00.651 --> 01:48:06.638]  I understand that the gun that he supposedly killed himself with didn't have a second shell in the chamber.
[01:48:06.738 --> 01:48:07.459]  Have you heard that, Alex?
[01:48:09.065 --> 01:48:24.476]  I had heard that, and I did confirm with major Canadian newspaper reporters that he was friends with and had talked to that he was going to do a big story about the Bushes and that, and we know about the Bushes and their gay porn stars in there, and that Thompson got his head blown off right after that happened.
[01:48:24.996 --> 01:48:27.458]  Yeah, the whole story sounds kind of hinky the more I look at it.
[01:48:28.339 --> 01:48:30.100]  Oh, I've got one more little thing for you, Alex.
[01:48:30.660 --> 01:48:37.025]  Just on the bite side, I started screaming about 9-11 the day it happened, and of course, during those days, I mean, you were...
[01:48:37.981 --> 01:48:39.962]  You're the devil if you started to say anything.
[01:48:39.982 --> 01:48:49.944]  It looked weird about 9-11, although you see now that just about everybody I talk to will at least listen, and a lot of people will say, well, yeah, you know, that does look kind of weird.
[01:48:50.644 --> 01:48:54.706]  So that's a positive thing, and there's a bit of information that you might be interested in.
[01:48:54.746 --> 01:49:06.889]  There's a fellow on the Internet, you can look it up, as Ghost Gun, who's been researching the look of the videos and the still pictures that were taken during the second plane hit of 9-11.
[01:49:07.984 --> 01:49:20.193]  And the wings, the deformity of the wings, and weird glitches in the video itself, and also what appears to be manipulation of the images from all the different sources.
[01:49:21.014 --> 01:49:22.395]  Something to look at.
[01:49:22.515 --> 01:49:23.236]  All right, thank you.
[01:49:23.276 --> 01:49:24.537]  We're out of time.
[01:49:24.557 --> 01:49:28.740]  I would just tell people, I don't know how I can do this, but listen.
[01:49:29.621 --> 01:49:31.542]  Everybody wants to always cover what's sexy.
[01:49:31.562 --> 01:49:36.886]  You know, laser beams, holograms, all this stuff, no plane at the Pentagon.
[01:49:37.287 --> 01:49:37.647]  Fine.
[01:49:39.472 --> 01:49:41.154]  What about public officials worn out to fly?
[01:49:41.194 --> 01:49:42.596]  What about NORAD standing now?
[01:49:42.656 --> 01:49:44.338]  What about those hundreds of points?
[01:49:44.378 --> 01:49:46.441]  Larry Silverstein saying he blew it up.
[01:49:47.982 --> 01:49:51.467]  I mean, if I'm a prosecutor, I'm going to go after the things I can totally prove.
[01:49:54.410 --> 01:49:57.274]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.987 --> 01:49:59.287]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.487 --> 01:50:05.229]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.509 --> 01:50:10.750]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:11.050 --> 01:50:15.211]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.391 --> 01:50:19.172]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.412 --> 01:50:23.993]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.113 --> 01:50:30.377]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.437 --> 01:50:32.298]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:53:00.475 --> 01:53:10.180]  Well, as hours blasted past us, we have a Village Voice writer coming on with ten unanswered questions, which have been answered.
[01:53:10.820 --> 01:53:11.741]  About 9-11.
[01:53:13.021 --> 01:53:13.962]  These aren't the ten I'd pick.
[01:53:14.022 --> 01:53:14.762]  I mean, a few of them are.
[01:53:15.582 --> 01:53:21.405]  But I just want to be able to get our guests back up in the near future to update us as things develop.
[01:53:21.985 --> 01:53:24.607]  And, of course, he's John Gilmore.
[01:53:24.927 --> 01:53:26.528]  We really appreciate him coming on today.
[01:53:27.128 --> 01:53:29.029]  John, do you have a website or anything yet?
[01:53:30.199 --> 01:53:31.280]  No, I don't.
[01:53:31.540 --> 01:53:37.224]  I posted my letters on a blog, Alex, but I really haven't started a website or anything yet.
[01:53:37.264 --> 01:53:38.825]  That's probably the next thing I'm planning to do.
[01:53:38.845 --> 01:53:40.186]  Well, if you do, we'd love to link to it.
[01:53:40.226 --> 01:53:41.627]  Let's take a few more calls here.
[01:53:42.048 --> 01:53:44.529]  Let's go ahead and talk to Don in Kansas City.
[01:53:44.549 --> 01:53:45.330]  Don, go ahead.
[01:53:45.970 --> 01:53:46.351]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:46.771 --> 01:53:53.796]  We don't get the first hour here in Kansas City, so I don't know if you covered this or not, but I came across an article on the web last night saying,
[01:53:54.249 --> 01:53:57.332]  I think it was through Capitol Hill Blue, published on Saturday.
[01:53:57.352 --> 01:53:58.072]  Did you see that?
[01:53:58.092 --> 01:54:03.657]  Yeah, about saying that Bush said the Constitution's a GED piece of paper.
[01:54:04.157 --> 01:54:04.637]  Exactly.
[01:54:04.658 --> 01:54:12.764]  And I tell you, I can't believe that that wasn't a trial balloon, probably with his father behind it, to see what the reaction of the country would be.
[01:54:13.224 --> 01:54:20.090]  If we don't give an earful to our congressmen and our senators during this Christmas vacation about this thing, we probably deserve what we're going to get.
[01:54:20.550 --> 01:54:20.791]  Well...
[01:54:21.838 --> 01:54:25.383]  Capitol Hill Blue exposed Bill Clinton, broke so many stories.
[01:54:26.104 --> 01:54:33.333]  It's a little paper record up there on the Hill, and everything they've reported on has always turned out to be true.
[01:54:33.353 --> 01:54:34.475]  They have inside sources.
[01:54:34.935 --> 01:54:39.842]  They reported how Bush is throwing fits and running around screaming, and now that's even been in the New York Daily News.
[01:54:40.322 --> 01:54:42.003]  Well, I'd say if we don't take some action on this, I mean, we...
[01:55:05.091 --> 01:55:11.375]  I want to know why someone didn't stay up in that meeting and say, okay, when did the impeachment proceedings start?
[01:55:11.896 --> 01:55:15.518]  The guy took an oath to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:18.620]  No, I hear you.
[01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:19.981]  That's in the stack of stuff.
[01:55:20.021 --> 01:55:21.682]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:55:21.702 --> 01:55:22.943]  People want to go read about it.
[01:55:23.964 --> 01:55:27.246]  But it was posted over the weekend, and it's just unbelievable.
[01:55:27.286 --> 01:55:27.826]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:27.846 --> 01:55:28.887]  You want to comment on that, John?
[01:55:29.867 --> 01:55:30.908]  No, I really haven't looked into it.
[01:55:30.948 --> 01:55:32.149]  I haven't heard much about that, Alex.
[01:55:33.949 --> 01:55:36.833]  Have you read the stories where Bush throws the fetch and runs around screaming?
[01:55:36.993 --> 01:55:38.375]  No, I haven't read that at all, actually.
[01:55:38.856 --> 01:55:42.041]  Yeah, it's even been in mainstream papers.
[01:55:42.101 --> 01:55:42.782]  It's confirmed.
[01:55:42.802 --> 01:55:45.486]  He just gets upset and starts screaming?
[01:55:46.395 --> 01:55:50.440]  Yeah, but I don't mean just like going, oh, you know, and throwing a book across the room or something like that.
[01:55:50.740 --> 01:55:52.582]  Most people might do every couple years or something.
[01:55:52.662 --> 01:55:57.207]  I mean, I guess I've done that a few times, but just frothing and screaming for hours on end.
[01:55:57.588 --> 01:55:58.469]  I'll have to look that up.
[01:55:58.489 --> 01:55:59.510]  I haven't read much about that.
[01:55:59.810 --> 01:56:01.632]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ray in Delaware.
[01:56:01.672 --> 01:56:02.413]  Ray, go ahead.
[01:56:02.653 --> 01:56:03.695]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:56:03.935 --> 01:56:04.415]  Hi, Ray.
[01:56:04.696 --> 01:56:05.377]  Hey, John.
[01:56:05.397 --> 01:56:07.279]  You made my day.
[01:56:07.910 --> 01:56:08.311]  What's that?
[01:56:08.491 --> 01:56:09.572]  You've made my day.
[01:56:09.592 --> 01:56:10.473]  Well, I'm glad to hear that.
[01:56:10.753 --> 01:56:17.199]  I've been depressed all morning, but it's such a breath of fresh air to see Christians waking up to what's going on.
[01:56:17.539 --> 01:56:23.585]  Well, I think that's one of the reasons I've done what I'm going to do, and I think God's getting the word out, man.
[01:56:23.806 --> 01:56:31.333]  Yeah, I called Alex on Friday, and I told him, you can find the truth if you look for leaks and you know where to look.
[01:56:32.393 --> 01:56:36.695]  And once you know the plan, it's reaffirmed every day.
[01:56:36.795 --> 01:56:38.555]  Well, I'll tell you why the media picked up on this.
[01:56:39.156 --> 01:56:40.756]  They want to create a chilling effect.
[01:56:40.796 --> 01:56:44.318]  You talk about this, you get fired, but it's not going to work.
[01:56:44.858 --> 01:56:46.078]  Yeah.
[01:56:46.558 --> 01:56:51.040]  Let me tell you my weekend, and this is a good example for people, and you should do it too, John.
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:58.603]  This weekend I was able to watch a whole program by the writer of the new Pearl Harbor, David Ray Griffith.
[01:56:59.793 --> 01:57:00.754]  Are you familiar with that?
[01:57:00.774 --> 01:57:01.094]  Yes, he is.
[01:57:01.134 --> 01:57:01.575]  No, I don't.
[01:57:01.835 --> 01:57:02.195]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:02.515 --> 01:57:03.196]  Yeah, I know exactly.
[01:57:03.276 --> 01:57:06.318]  Okay, you know, the 47 pillars that were shipped to China.
[01:57:06.338 --> 01:57:10.161]  The reason I say that is because in one of your articles you wrote, John, you mentioned him.
[01:57:10.462 --> 01:57:11.503]  That's right.
[01:57:11.543 --> 01:57:11.883]  You know what?
[01:57:11.923 --> 01:57:12.323]  Stay there.
[01:57:12.583 --> 01:57:13.985]  Listen, we've only got a few more minutes with our guest.
[01:57:14.005 --> 01:57:17.587]  I'm going to hold the other one off about five, but you're going to have to move real quick, Ray.
[01:57:17.988 --> 01:57:20.610]  I'm going to give you about 30 seconds on the other side, and we're going to talk to Fred in Indiana.
[01:57:20.630 --> 01:57:23.893]  And then we've got our next guest coming up, so we've got to move quick here.
[01:57:23.913 --> 01:57:25.494]  I hope our guest can stay five more minutes with us.
[01:57:26.215 --> 01:57:28.576]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:29.156 --> 01:57:31.457]  Be sure and get all the new videos at InfoWars.com.
[01:57:49.839 --> 01:57:50.500]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.140 --> 01:57:52.241]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.921 --> 01:57:54.022]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.662 --> 01:57:55.503]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.243 --> 01:57:57.224]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.804 --> 01:58:01.466]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.987 --> 01:58:06.129]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.329 --> 01:58:15.375]  All right, folks, we're now into the third and final hour of Massive Nose Show.
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:21.043]  We've got a reporter coming off of Village Voice asking serious questions about the official story of 9-11.
[01:58:21.183 --> 01:58:32.709]  For the last 50 minutes or so, we've been talking to John Gilmore, who was the general manager of Knowledge Inc., the big cable company and internet company in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[01:58:32.789 --> 01:58:36.031]  It's a national company based out of Georgia, but he was the general manager there locally.
[01:58:36.572 --> 01:58:40.614]  We're talking about the New World Order and global government, and they just said, basically fired him.
[01:58:41.374 --> 01:58:44.815]  But now he's been speaking out and getting involved and trying to stand up against the chilling effect.
[01:58:45.176 --> 01:58:47.276]  We were talking to Ray in Delaware.
[01:58:47.336 --> 01:58:48.337]  Finishing up your points, Ray.
[01:58:48.357 --> 01:58:50.378]  You were bringing up David Ray Griffin.
[01:58:50.558 --> 01:58:50.938]  Go ahead.
[01:58:51.318 --> 01:58:51.958]  Okay.
[01:58:52.198 --> 01:58:55.280]  The reason I was able to watch that was I was on satellite TV.
[01:58:55.380 --> 01:58:56.640]  I have satellite TV.
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:02.963]  That black cable that comes into your home that brings cable TV is the tail of the devil.
[01:59:03.703 --> 01:59:05.704]  It's under the devil's control.
[01:59:06.284 --> 01:59:09.066]  It's under the New World Order of Control.
[01:59:09.626 --> 01:59:10.847]  It censors the news.
[01:59:10.867 --> 01:59:12.188]  The satellite does not.
[01:59:12.208 --> 01:59:15.730]  You can see things on satellite TV.
[01:59:16.131 --> 01:59:17.952]  You can find the truth on satellite TV.
[01:59:17.972 --> 01:59:26.217]  Well, there is a wider selection a lot of times, and the digital cable really can track what you're watching and how you're watching, and so can TiVo.
[01:59:26.478 --> 01:59:30.020]  We're talking to the big cable expert, and thanks for the call.
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:31.901]  Ray, do you want to comment on that, John?
[01:59:32.562 --> 01:59:34.063]  Well, I don't want to talk about it too much.
[01:59:36.886 --> 01:59:43.130]  I think there is a certain amount of, well, with TiVo or any type of recording device.
[01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:44.751]  Well, the computer, period.
[01:59:44.831 --> 01:59:46.552]  I mean, computers with cookies and all of it.
[01:59:46.592 --> 01:59:47.213]  Oh, yeah.
[01:59:47.493 --> 01:59:51.956]  Yeah, I mean, whether it's cookies on your TV or TiVo, you know, they've admitted a couple of times that
[01:59:52.546 --> 01:59:58.207]  You know, when you hear something like with the Janet Jackson incident a couple years ago, they said it was the highest watched replay.
[01:59:58.247 --> 02:00:01.328]  So obviously they know what you're watching, and they can pull that information.
[02:00:01.588 --> 02:00:02.008]  Absolutely.
[02:00:02.028 --> 02:00:04.928]  Let's take a final call here, and then I've got to end this segment.
[02:00:05.248 --> 02:00:06.989]  Let's talk to Fred in Indiana.
[02:00:07.029 --> 02:00:07.669]  Fred, go ahead.
[02:00:07.689 --> 02:00:08.229]  Thanks for holding.
[02:00:08.509 --> 02:00:09.249]  Hey, thanks, Alex.
[02:00:10.269 --> 02:00:12.710]  I'm looking for two things that you talked about before.
[02:00:13.770 --> 02:00:20.011]  The 700 Club preacher that was making the devil sign every time he said Jesus, that you had that videotaped.
[02:00:20.911 --> 02:00:23.912]  I've never seen it make it up onto InfoWars.com.
[02:00:23.952 --> 02:00:24.552]  No, it's there.
[02:00:24.572 --> 02:00:25.552]  It was big.
[02:00:25.892 --> 02:00:26.412]  Oh, was it there?
[02:00:26.732 --> 02:00:28.933]  Yeah, there's just so much on the websites.
[02:00:28.953 --> 02:00:32.893]  It might have been on Prison Planet and not InfoWars, but no, I saw it on InfoWars.
[02:00:33.473 --> 02:00:33.873]  Okay.
[02:00:33.893 --> 02:00:34.914]  Did you see that, John?
[02:00:35.694 --> 02:00:36.334]  No, I haven't.
[02:00:37.034 --> 02:00:38.454]  Where is it listed under?
[02:00:38.534 --> 02:00:39.935]  Do you know?
[02:00:40.495 --> 02:00:41.935]  We're not in the blog format yet.
[02:00:41.975 --> 02:00:42.695]  We're going to that.
[02:00:42.715 --> 02:00:46.496]  We're very hot check, or be in a key section, but...
[02:00:47.817 --> 02:00:48.878]  It was up for weeks.
[02:00:49.118 --> 02:00:51.160]  It was in TV reports, everything we did.
[02:00:51.501 --> 02:00:53.102]  Okay, I'll just have to look around a little bit.
[02:00:53.402 --> 02:00:58.767]  Yeah, just type in patrobertsondiabloinfowars.com into Google.
[02:00:59.087 --> 02:01:00.509]  Okay, and then there was one other video.
[02:01:00.529 --> 02:01:04.873]  It was the FEMA director talking about how he had the command bunker set up the night before.
[02:01:04.893 --> 02:01:07.115]  And it's on there, but the link is broken.
[02:01:07.135 --> 02:01:08.276]  I don't know if you know that or not.
[02:01:08.886 --> 02:01:10.988]  Yeah, we have only a few webmasters.
[02:01:11.008 --> 02:01:12.029]  Stuff does break.
[02:01:12.089 --> 02:01:13.610]  Again, you type in that headline.
[02:01:13.630 --> 02:01:15.832]  Do you ever use search engines, sir?
[02:01:16.372 --> 02:01:21.797]  Yeah, I got my own website set up, righttothink.com, which was inspired by you guys.
[02:01:21.837 --> 02:01:22.277]  Well, good.
[02:01:23.018 --> 02:01:23.838]  Listen, I'm going to let you go.
[02:01:23.878 --> 02:01:24.399]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:24.419 --> 02:01:25.900]  I want to be able to say bye to our guest.
[02:01:26.961 --> 02:01:27.902]  I will try to...
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:29.801]  Find that for you.
[02:01:29.921 --> 02:01:30.922]  It wasn't the FEMA director.
[02:01:30.982 --> 02:01:31.943]  It was Mr. Kinney.
[02:01:32.504 --> 02:01:33.745]  Then they said his name was Kennedy.
[02:01:34.325 --> 02:01:50.360]  And they first tried to deny that FEMA had been there, but then in a congressional hearing, and then in the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, it even came out that, yes, indeed, it was called Tripod 2, and they were conducting a drill that day and had moved the emergency bunker already out of Building 7 the day before the attack.
[02:01:50.681 --> 02:01:51.862]  Comments, John, in closing.
[02:01:53.190 --> 02:01:56.632]  The only comments I would have is that I would encourage everybody to read my letters.
[02:01:57.092 --> 02:02:03.154]  I think there's a lot of good stuff in there, a lot of which you've talked about, Alex, with some other things I think that you may not have touched on so much.
[02:02:03.214 --> 02:02:12.818]  But for those out there that are starting to get into learning about these things, I commend you and I would just tell everybody to keep at it because what you're researching is true.
[02:02:14.207 --> 02:02:27.793]  Well, we appreciate people like you out there, John, and as more and more folks bite the bullet and stand up, it makes us all safer, it makes us all a better society, so I commend you and Godspeed for exposing 9-11 and so much more.
[02:02:28.093 --> 02:02:28.733]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:02:28.934 --> 02:02:29.254]  Take care.
[02:02:29.534 --> 02:02:30.794]  I hope to talk to you again in the future.
[02:02:30.954 --> 02:02:31.275]  We will.
[02:02:31.595 --> 02:02:31.735]  Bye.
[02:02:32.295 --> 02:02:33.636]  All right, there goes John Gilmore.
[02:02:33.676 --> 02:02:40.198]  He was the general manager there in Knoxville, Tennessee, of the big cable company, and kicked him out, fired him for talking about the New World Order.
[02:02:40.799 --> 02:02:43.500]  We'll be right back, and I'll talk to a New York reporter.
[02:02:46.607 --> 02:02:49.470]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.731 --> 02:02:50.432]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.512 --> 02:02:51.293]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.653 --> 02:02:56.319]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.659 --> 02:03:03.407]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.727 --> 02:03:05.708]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.908 --> 02:03:08.750]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.830 --> 02:03:13.513]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.713 --> 02:03:18.115]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.355 --> 02:03:25.559]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.819 --> 02:03:28.241]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.401 --> 02:03:30.142]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[02:03:30.282 --> 02:03:36.291]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[02:03:36.392 --> 02:03:38.896]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online
[02:03:47.307 --> 02:03:48.348]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.668 --> 02:03:51.471]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.732 --> 02:03:55.876]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.316 --> 02:03:57.137]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.457 --> 02:04:02.022]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.526 --> 02:04:04.627]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.127 --> 02:04:19.834]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.874 --> 02:04:26.998]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:27.298 --> 02:04:30.439]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[02:04:32.200 --> 02:04:37.404]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[02:04:37.424 --> 02:04:43.428]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[02:04:58.052 --> 02:04:58.652]  We're good to go.
[02:04:58.672 --> 02:04:59.452]  We're good to go.
[02:04:59.472 --> 02:04:59.992]  We're good to go.
[02:05:26.937 --> 02:05:27.777]  We're good to go.
[02:05:27.797 --> 02:05:28.037]  I think?
[02:05:28.077 --> 02:05:29.057]  We're good to go.
[02:05:29.077 --> 02:05:29.277]  I think?
[02:06:01.377 --> 02:06:15.772]  All right, our next guest is going to be with us to the bottom of the hour, and then I'm going to get into the opening missions of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, basically cooking your ovaries and testicles.
[02:06:17.104 --> 02:06:18.244]  Those are the names of the organs.
[02:06:18.304 --> 02:06:19.485]  I'm sorry if that freaks you out.
[02:06:19.505 --> 02:06:22.486]  It causes massive birth defects.
[02:06:22.566 --> 02:06:32.268]  And then major studies, total conclusive proof, one with the Amish, with hundreds of thousands of Amish, that none of them have autism.
[02:06:32.308 --> 02:06:39.030]  It's unknown, but one out of 160-something Americans now has it as being born because of the thimerosal mercury.
[02:06:39.090 --> 02:06:42.791]  These are new reports here, and I wanted to go over that.
[02:06:44.307 --> 02:06:49.950]  And Tommy Thompson is saying he's going to promote your kids getting chips, but he's now refusing to take a microchip.
[02:06:53.192 --> 02:06:54.193]  So that's coming up.
[02:06:54.233 --> 02:06:59.136]  We're about to go to the Village Voice reporter, Jarrett Murphy, who we really appreciate joining us.
[02:06:59.416 --> 02:07:08.681]  Before we do that, and then of course your calls later before the show ends in the next 50 minutes, my new video, The Order of Death, is out.
[02:07:08.701 --> 02:07:10.242]  Do you want to know what Skull and Bones really is?
[02:07:10.422 --> 02:07:11.643]  What Bohemian Girl really is?
[02:07:12.844 --> 02:07:26.455]  If you want to understand who controls our society, if you want to know where we're headed, and if you want the conclusive proof, new footage inside Bohemian Grove, not just the footage I got back in 2000, first and only person to ever sneak in.
[02:07:28.197 --> 02:07:32.360]  Now we have new footage inside the owl of the effigy.
[02:07:32.380 --> 02:07:33.501]  They torch all of it.
[02:07:34.284 --> 02:07:41.552]  The playground of the Bushies and other Christian conservatives where they bust in the male prostitutes and run around worshipping the devil.
[02:07:41.752 --> 02:07:43.273]  This is what they do, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:43.313 --> 02:07:46.296]  They're very repressed and they've got a lot of mental problems.
[02:07:47.077 --> 02:07:48.699]  And you need to have the order of death.
[02:07:48.719 --> 02:07:55.045]  And then part two, of course, is the original Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove on one DVD or one VHS.
[02:07:55.085 --> 02:07:56.447]  Two films for the price of one.
[02:07:57.458 --> 02:07:59.799]  And it's available right now at InfoWars.com.
[02:07:59.839 --> 02:08:03.121]  There's also one of my other new films, Martial Law.
[02:08:03.861 --> 02:08:05.202]  And it is three films in one.
[02:08:05.242 --> 02:08:07.203]  The latest police development is 9-11.
[02:08:07.443 --> 02:08:12.706]  We answer the questions and then we get into the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:08:13.026 --> 02:08:14.566]  The PNAC Boys, all of it.
[02:08:15.027 --> 02:08:17.908]  So many books and videos we're carrying at InfoWars.com.
[02:08:18.208 --> 02:08:20.329]  Go peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:23.691]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and for 15 cents a day...
[02:08:24.657 --> 02:08:30.522]  Actually, right now, with the Christmas discounts, it's 11 cents a day, get a monthly or a yearly subscription.
[02:08:31.142 --> 02:08:35.165]  All my videos, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, everything.
[02:08:35.185 --> 02:08:36.106]  It's ridiculous.
[02:08:36.446 --> 02:08:38.067]  Thousands of pieces of media now.
[02:08:38.668 --> 02:08:42.471]  All my best audio interviews, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:08:42.611 --> 02:08:43.111]  Check it out.
[02:08:43.171 --> 02:08:44.192]  All right, going to our guest.
[02:08:44.632 --> 02:08:52.899]  Without further ado, Village Voice asked 10 big questions about 9-11, opened and shut for four years later.
[02:08:52.959 --> 02:08:54.320]  We still have 10 big questions.
[02:08:55.063 --> 02:08:56.063]  And here are the ten questions.
[02:08:56.283 --> 02:08:57.664]  And then he goes into detail on these.
[02:08:57.824 --> 02:08:59.764]  Where was the National Command Authority?
[02:09:00.145 --> 02:09:06.126]  Well, in June 1st, that authority was taken away from the generals and given to Rumsfeld only.
[02:09:07.507 --> 02:09:10.008]  Who gave the order to try to shoot down the planes?
[02:09:10.068 --> 02:09:11.228]  Dick Cheney, we already know that.
[02:09:12.112 --> 02:09:14.934]  And that was just the last one, because things didn't go according to plan.
[02:09:15.294 --> 02:09:21.719]  Number three, what exactly were all those firefighters doing in the towers?
[02:09:21.759 --> 02:09:28.763]  They were ordered to go into the towers, because no building had ever collapsed before, and magically did on that day, three of them.
[02:09:29.164 --> 02:09:31.205]  Did anyone think the towers would collapse?
[02:09:31.305 --> 02:09:34.127]  No, no one thought that but Giuliani, who got told to get out of Building 7.
[02:09:35.488 --> 02:09:38.170]  Five, why was Giuliani's command bunker at Ground Zero?
[02:09:38.988 --> 02:09:41.789]  Number six, why did WTC 7 fall?
[02:09:42.210 --> 02:09:43.470]  Silverstein says he pulled it.
[02:09:45.531 --> 02:09:48.692]  Number seven, how did the Twin Towers fall?
[02:09:50.013 --> 02:09:54.335]  And then number eight, how dangerous was and is the air at ground zero?
[02:09:54.355 --> 02:09:56.456]  Well, the EPA's own report said it's totally deadly.
[02:09:57.618 --> 02:10:07.988]  And now most of the rescue dogs have died, and a lot of people are sick, and it was just the mercury and other toxins alone from all the hundreds of thousands of smoke detectors and computers and all of that.
[02:10:08.708 --> 02:10:12.772]  Why did Zacharias Michali plan to do exactly?
[02:10:13.092 --> 02:10:15.475]  Number ten, what's on those blanked out pages?
[02:10:16.796 --> 02:10:19.779]  And of course, I've got another ten questions.
[02:10:19.799 --> 02:10:23.162]  Why was public officials warned not to fly?
[02:10:24.122 --> 02:10:25.723]  Why did NORAD stand down?
[02:10:25.743 --> 02:10:27.645]  Why has Bin Laden announced CIS?
[02:10:27.685 --> 02:10:28.385]  On and on and on.
[02:10:28.726 --> 02:10:32.469]  Thank you for coming on with us, Jared Murphy.
[02:10:32.489 --> 02:10:33.109]  Thanks for coming on.
[02:10:33.429 --> 02:10:34.050]  No problem.
[02:10:34.070 --> 02:10:34.970]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:10:35.010 --> 02:10:35.611]  I appreciate it.
[02:10:36.427 --> 02:10:39.709]  I'm glad you went through and answered basically my ten questions.
[02:10:39.809 --> 02:10:42.730]  If I had talked to you, I would have been able to write a shorter piece.
[02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.811]  Sure.
[02:10:43.831 --> 02:10:50.754]  Obviously, you say unanswered because the government has its own mythology, which is the ultimate conspiracy theory.
[02:10:50.774 --> 02:10:54.996]  If you really look at what they're saying, it's impossible, and you look at all the other
[02:10:55.936 --> 02:10:57.097]  Well, thank you.
[02:10:57.157 --> 02:10:59.119]  I wasn't here for September 11th.
[02:10:59.139 --> 02:11:01.541]  I had moved to London about a week earlier, and I was very affected by it.
[02:11:01.561 --> 02:11:03.963]  And when I came back, I didn't write about it very much at all, actually.
[02:11:03.983 --> 02:11:04.183]  And then I...
[02:11:21.860 --> 02:11:26.321]  Decided to take a look at some of the oral histories that firefighters have recorded.
[02:11:26.341 --> 02:11:33.602]  As your listeners may or may not know, after an incident in New York in which firefighters die, there's always an investigation.
[02:11:34.182 --> 02:11:38.603]  And, of course, there are 343 reasons to do that investigation after September 11th.
[02:11:39.403 --> 02:11:45.385]  And the fire department recorded oral histories with, I think it was 511 of their personnel, firefighters, officers, EMS people.
[02:11:48.432 --> 02:11:56.018]  And a few months later, the New York Times tried to get those documents released to the public, and a court battle ensued under Freedom of Information Law.
[02:11:56.618 --> 02:12:16.732]  And finally this summer, the tapes of some of the radio transmissions, as well as the oral histories themselves, which are written transcripts at this point, they were released, and I decided to take a look at some of those because we were sort of looking at Bloomberg's record prior to the election, and his stewardship of 9-11 issues is certainly a part of what he did in his first term there.
[02:12:17.168 --> 02:12:18.389]  And those are our histories.
[02:12:18.429 --> 02:12:19.909]  They raised a lot of questions.
[02:12:20.149 --> 02:12:34.855]  There are so many things that departed from the kind of blanket statements that were made in the 9-11 Commission Report and from things that I accept were true about what firefighters were told to do that day and what was believed about the structure and the safety of that building.
[02:12:35.455 --> 02:12:39.757]  And that just sort of led me to write this, an earlier piece.
[02:12:39.817 --> 02:12:45.259]  And then that, as I'm sure you've encountered over the years, that led some people to come out of the work and start
[02:12:46.221 --> 02:12:47.923]  Asking me about some other questions.
[02:12:48.443 --> 02:13:00.135]  We just decided, as I was in the midst of working on some of these questions, I got notice in the email that the last meeting of the 9-11 Discourse Project was going to take place.
[02:13:00.756 --> 02:13:09.365]  It just struck me as funny that we were achieving that sense of finality in terms of official inquiries when there are these multiplying questions.
[02:13:10.032 --> 02:13:12.255]  Of varying degrees of seriousness.
[02:13:12.455 --> 02:13:13.557]  Well, would you agree with this?
[02:13:13.617 --> 02:13:18.263]  There is a systematic cover-up by government going on at every level.
[02:13:18.844 --> 02:13:20.827]  They hauled away the waste at a crime scene.
[02:13:20.847 --> 02:13:24.431]  The firefighter unions and others complained and were told to shut up.
[02:13:25.132 --> 02:13:37.159]  And then on top of all of this, many, many of those firefighter tapes in those interviews and then actual transmission tapes from the day as it happened live were reporting bombs and explosions.
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:45.144]  And then the government tried to block those, declaring confidentiality and national security.
[02:13:45.164 --> 02:13:45.625]  Your comments?
[02:13:46.185 --> 02:13:51.208]  Well, you are right about the contents of some of those oral histories talking about secondary explosions.
[02:13:51.228 --> 02:13:54.550]  That is almost uniform among people who saw the second tower fall.
[02:13:55.209 --> 02:14:01.471]  I don't know what those meant, and I don't know how much I subscribe to some of the theories about what brought the building down.
[02:14:02.231 --> 02:14:08.852]  As a reporter, I also can't say definitively that I know for a fact there has been a cover-up in every level of government.
[02:14:09.293 --> 02:14:18.575]  What I can say is that I think there has been a reluctance to address all of these issues, and I mean that across the spectrum when it comes to 9-11 in terms of the foreign policy.
[02:14:18.595 --> 02:14:23.136]  Well, why block the oral histories of the firefighters when the firefighters are asking it be released?
[02:14:23.823 --> 02:14:24.804]  Well, there are a lot of reasons.
[02:14:24.884 --> 02:14:30.268]  I mean, one thing, as I'm sure you know, the chief motivation for a lot of things is money.
[02:14:30.708 --> 02:14:35.812]  And what the thing is the city is worried about is losing a lot of money in a lawsuit by firefighters.
[02:14:35.993 --> 02:14:42.818]  And for those who died, they're kin over some of the mistakes that may have been made that day or in earlier days in terms of selecting the radios.
[02:14:43.342 --> 02:14:44.562]  In terms of command and control.
[02:14:44.802 --> 02:14:55.405]  Have you heard the talk there in New York about it bankrupting Manhattan because of all the toxic waste and asbestos that was released by the thousands of tons into the atmosphere?
[02:14:56.066 --> 02:14:59.467]  There is certainly something that has been in the press for a month.
[02:14:59.487 --> 02:15:01.807]  Juan Gonzalez of the Daily News was one of the first to talk about it.
[02:15:02.267 --> 02:15:11.190]  Since I believe early 2002, the fact that we were given these assurances so soon after the event by the EPA, and now their own Inspector General has said that
[02:15:11.877 --> 02:15:25.029]  Well, first the EPA was saying it was deadly and then Bush blocked the money because to admit that there was a disability would admit there was a problem.
[02:15:25.889 --> 02:15:26.510]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:27.010 --> 02:15:38.320]  So much of what has occurred since September 11th has been about protecting certain industries from creating the impression, and I don't think it's necessarily a solid impression,
[02:15:39.620 --> 02:15:42.007]  Of us being safe to fly airplanes again.
[02:15:42.027 --> 02:15:47.963]  If you subscribe, as I do, to the belief that this was a result of hijacking.
[02:15:48.699 --> 02:15:49.520]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:56.646]  Why didn't you bring up the point... I mean, it's on the record that some of the Joint Chiefs of Staff told MSNBC, we were told not to fly to New York that day.
[02:15:57.547 --> 02:16:04.112]  It's well known that Connalisa Rice made the call to her old buddy, Mayor Willie Brown, in San Francisco and said, don't fly here tomorrow morning.
[02:16:04.172 --> 02:16:10.318]  I mean, we know that Solomon Rushdie, Times of London, got told don't fly here for the month of September for your safety in New York.
[02:16:10.718 --> 02:16:12.920]  I mean, shouldn't that be looked at?
[02:16:13.040 --> 02:16:15.022]  Why did Mayor Willie Brown get a warning?
[02:16:15.502 --> 02:16:22.407]  Yeah, I don't know if any of those things are true, but, you know, the thing with this is, you know, you said you had another ten questions of your own just off the top of your head.
[02:16:22.847 --> 02:16:27.050]  I mean, in any tragedy, there are questions that some get answered, some don't.
[02:16:27.350 --> 02:16:33.954]  With this one in particular, there are just dozens and dozens and dozens of areas where the facts have not been fully supplied.
[02:16:34.294 --> 02:16:40.218]  And what I decided to do, because I think for a lot of people here, especially, there's a great emotional wound about this.
[02:16:40.798 --> 02:16:44.621]  And sometimes when you're wounded, you want to look into it, and sometimes you want to just sort of forget about it.
[02:16:45.177 --> 02:17:06.307]  And I was hoping to ask questions confined solely to what happened on the day of 9-11 and thereafter in terms of official investigations, just hoping to sort of put the impression in people's minds that there were still things to talk about, that the 9-11 Commission didn't dot every I and cross every T. And so I tried to confine myself to those things because, frankly, that's the area that I've done the most research in.
[02:17:06.947 --> 02:17:10.289]  But you're right that there are lots of other questions that could be answered and should be answered.
[02:17:10.951 --> 02:17:17.615]  I don't know if the answer would be to confirm the information we have about whether people did or did not get warnings, but it certainly would be good to know.
[02:17:18.836 --> 02:17:23.659]  Well, one more quick segment with you, and we really appreciate Jarrett Murphy of the Village Voice joining us.
[02:17:23.679 --> 02:17:28.502]  We have links to the articles he's written up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:31.004 --> 02:17:32.285]  What's the Village Voice website?
[02:17:32.325 --> 02:17:33.466]  VillageVoice.com?
[02:17:33.706 --> 02:17:36.227]  www.VillageVoice.com That's right, VillageVoice.com.
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:39.322]  And we'll be right back.
[02:17:39.722 --> 02:17:43.367]  I've got really three final questions for our guests.
[02:17:45.828 --> 02:17:49.729]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:17:49.950 --> 02:18:02.214]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:18:02.654 --> 02:18:03.054]  The U.S.
[02:18:03.094 --> 02:18:08.676]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:18:09.077 --> 02:18:11.277]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:18:13.138 --> 02:18:13.618]  We're good to go.
[02:18:33.826 --> 02:18:34.167]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:46.823 --> 02:18:51.327]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:51.687 --> 02:18:55.751]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:56.051 --> 02:18:56.612]  We listened.
[02:18:56.912 --> 02:19:01.896]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:02.177 --> 02:19:02.657]  We listened.
[02:19:03.057 --> 02:19:06.100]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:06.520 --> 02:19:07.041]  We listened.
[02:19:07.501 --> 02:19:11.565]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:19:11.945 --> 02:19:12.426]  We listened.
[02:19:12.766 --> 02:19:17.991]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:19:18.431 --> 02:19:19.793]  Again, we listened.
[02:19:20.153 --> 02:19:27.540]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:31.383]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[02:19:36.773 --> 02:19:38.395]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:19:38.415 --> 02:19:39.837]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:46.832 --> 02:19:50.293]  Government is best which governs the... Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:50.733 --> 02:19:53.434]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:53.895 --> 02:19:56.536]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:19:56.976 --> 02:20:03.438]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:20:03.758 --> 02:20:11.121]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at libertystickers.com.
[02:20:11.661 --> 02:20:13.182]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:20:13.222 --> 02:20:13.442]  Have you?
[02:20:13.462 --> 02:20:14.522]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:20:14.542 --> 02:20:16.443]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:20:16.583 --> 02:20:17.324]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:20:38.587 --> 02:20:39.787]  Osama been forgotten.
[02:20:40.228 --> 02:20:43.949]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[02:20:46.030 --> 02:20:52.912]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:20:53.052 --> 02:21:05.996]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:21:06.156 --> 02:21:07.937]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:21:08.097 --> 02:21:08.717]  We're good to go.
[02:21:27.407 --> 02:21:29.608]  All right, we're talking to Jared Murphy.
[02:21:57.743 --> 02:22:03.149]  Jared, I will tell you that they claimed that all those firefighter recordings had malfunctioned.
[02:22:03.169 --> 02:22:06.772]  Then it turned out they had the recordings and just didn't want to release them.
[02:22:06.792 --> 02:22:08.494]  And then some of those did get released.
[02:22:08.574 --> 02:22:10.916]  And it was stuff like bombs, bombs, bombs.
[02:22:11.477 --> 02:22:13.239]  And so now we know why they didn't want them released.
[02:22:13.279 --> 02:22:14.981]  So I would just say that's what you were saying earlier.
[02:22:15.021 --> 02:22:15.221]  And then...
[02:22:16.124 --> 02:22:23.307]  You know, what about Zogby polls, where 49% think there's a cover-up and should be another investigation, where 90% are CNN polls?
[02:22:23.327 --> 02:22:40.874]  Or what about, I want to get your take on that, and then also Larry Silverstein coming out and building 7 way down the street, magically imploding perfectly, and squibs, blast point scene going off, and then he says, oh, we made the decision to pull the building and gave the order and watched it come down.
[02:22:41.554 --> 02:22:45.936]  And then the same documentary, they say that pulling means blowing it up.
[02:22:46.216 --> 02:22:55.761]  Can you comment on what New Yorkers think that you talk to, kind of the gamut of their views, and then are you aware of Larry Silverstein saying he, quote, pulled the building?
[02:22:56.521 --> 02:22:57.882]  Yeah, I'll do the last part first.
[02:22:57.942 --> 02:23:05.965]  I saw that clip, I think it was an ABC News clip, and I think I saw it on one of the DVDs that I purchased from 911truth.org, and
[02:23:07.714 --> 02:23:09.014]  You know, I don't know about that.
[02:23:09.054 --> 02:23:21.818]  I mean, certainly the WTC7 collapse is a mystery because it is such a historic, it would have been a historic first, it was a historic first for a steel building to collapse solely because of fire.
[02:23:21.878 --> 02:23:23.078]  Have you talked to Silverstein?
[02:23:23.438 --> 02:23:24.058]  No, I haven't.
[02:23:24.278 --> 02:23:26.179]  He won't talk to us or anybody else.
[02:23:26.579 --> 02:23:27.819]  No, I don't think he talks to many folks.
[02:23:27.839 --> 02:23:29.120]  When you get that rich, you don't have to.
[02:23:31.293 --> 02:23:40.536]  I don't know what happened in that building, but it is very interesting that it has taken us so long to get some answer, just even an official answer from NIST or anyone else.
[02:23:40.556 --> 02:23:43.977]  What did New Yorkers say?
[02:23:43.997 --> 02:23:45.817]  I think the poll you cited is interesting.
[02:23:45.877 --> 02:23:56.660]  The slow trickle over the years of points like you mentioned, for example, about the oral histories or the tapes anyway, how at first we were told they were lost and then they were found.
[02:23:57.210 --> 02:24:05.135]  I mean, the slow trickle of revelations like that has certainly punctured the credibility of the people who have been making official pronouncements on this stuff.
[02:24:05.515 --> 02:24:08.297]  Now, you know, people are always skeptical of the government as well.
[02:24:08.337 --> 02:24:08.798]  They should be.
[02:24:09.298 --> 02:24:16.122]  And, you know, there are certainly people who believe that a conspiracy took place and a lot of events... Here's another question then.
[02:24:16.302 --> 02:24:17.143]  Gulf of Tonkin.
[02:24:18.324 --> 02:24:20.185]  We knew 40 years ago that was staged.
[02:24:20.245 --> 02:24:21.706]  Now it's publicly admitted.
[02:24:21.746 --> 02:24:22.527]  They staged it.
[02:24:22.867 --> 02:24:23.748]  We attacked them.
[02:24:23.788 --> 02:24:25.169]  They were smart enough not to shoot back.
[02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:27.291]  58,000 Americans then died.
[02:24:27.951 --> 02:24:29.393]  We have Operation Northwoods.
[02:24:29.413 --> 02:24:29.853]  The U.S.
[02:24:29.873 --> 02:24:34.176]  government planned to hijack jets and crash them and kill Americans and blame it on Cuba.
[02:24:35.337 --> 02:24:36.778]  We have the USS Liberty.
[02:24:36.819 --> 02:24:39.821]  That was a staged attack on our own ship to blame it on Egypt.
[02:24:39.861 --> 02:24:40.782]  I mean, what do you say to that?
[02:24:41.642 --> 02:24:46.026]  Well, there's no question that the government has lied to its people before.
[02:24:46.590 --> 02:24:46.890]  I think so.
[02:25:08.722 --> 02:25:10.343]  Well, I know it's not scientific.
[02:25:10.863 --> 02:25:12.043]  Listen, I know it's not scientific.
[02:25:12.924 --> 02:25:20.507]  We've talked about the scientific polls, but just talking to two New Yorkers, what percentage think a criminal element of the government was involved?
[02:25:21.507 --> 02:25:26.649]  I would say a fairly small, in my experience, a fairly small percentage would tell you that.
[02:25:27.150 --> 02:25:33.252]  I think a fairly substantial percentage would tell you that they are not entirely confident in the official stories that's been told.
[02:25:33.512 --> 02:25:35.073]  And that the government let it happen?
[02:25:36.396 --> 02:25:37.937]  That's another version of it.
[02:25:37.957 --> 02:25:43.301]  I think more likely that the government knew or certainly people think it should have known about what was going on.
[02:25:44.682 --> 02:25:50.646]  But I think more people don't necessarily have a specific alternative theory, but they do have grave doubts.
[02:25:51.206 --> 02:25:59.192]  That's why you see poll numbers like the ones that say we should reopen the investigation or have a more thorough investigation.
[02:25:59.272 --> 02:26:05.036]  As you know, the 9-11 Commission had a lot of conflicts in terms of what those members' past histories were.
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:10.703]  And I attended or watched many of the hearings, and some of the questioning was not particularly awe-inspiring.
[02:26:11.204 --> 02:26:13.985]  So I think those things have rightfully... Well, it was softballs.
[02:26:14.005 --> 02:26:16.007]  They would just worship each other.
[02:26:16.647 --> 02:26:17.348]  Yeah, to some extent.
[02:26:17.368 --> 02:26:24.092]  But then you've got to say also, you know, I mean, they did manage to get that August 6 PDB out and that great scene where Benveniste, I think...
[02:26:24.708 --> 02:26:26.689]  Yeah, but see, that's a fallback to cover their position.
[02:26:26.850 --> 02:26:32.153]  Well, you know, the 9-11 Commission said that the WTC 1 and 2 were hollow and had no supports when they had the biggest of any building that size in the world.
[02:26:32.173 --> 02:26:33.854]  Just magically 47 columns in each building disappear.
[02:26:51.587 --> 02:26:54.955]  Yeah, I mean, I don't think they got too much into science, rightly or wrongly.
[02:26:54.975 --> 02:26:57.460]  That's been missed part of the game.
[02:26:57.480 --> 02:26:59.886]  Well, they came out and just said those pillars didn't exist.
[02:27:01.132 --> 02:27:02.994]  Yeah, I'm actually not familiar with that.
[02:27:03.174 --> 02:27:05.436]  That's why I'm saying you don't have a skull in your head.
[02:27:05.456 --> 02:27:07.758]  I mean, it's just totally made up.
[02:27:07.778 --> 02:27:13.103]  Well, listen, Jared Murphy, folks can read your articles there at VillageVoice.com, and I appreciate you coming on.
[02:27:13.143 --> 02:27:20.009]  And look, you know, I don't think your article's that hardcore, but at least it asks some questions, and that's better than most of the mainstream media.
[02:27:20.489 --> 02:27:23.492]  And so we appreciate you at least asking the questions, my friend.
[02:27:23.792 --> 02:27:24.393]  I appreciate it.
[02:27:24.433 --> 02:27:24.793]  Thank you.
[02:27:24.934 --> 02:27:25.714]  You bet.
[02:27:25.915 --> 02:27:27.837]  Keep up the decent work there.
[02:27:28.378 --> 02:27:31.041]  It's better than being on the Pentagon payroll like some reporters.
[02:27:31.081 --> 02:27:31.581]  God bless you.
[02:27:32.122 --> 02:27:32.823]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.766 --> 02:27:36.647]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.148 --> 02:27:38.729]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.749 --> 02:27:42.354]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.549 --> 02:27:45.669]  Yeah.
[02:28:04.150 --> 02:28:04.810]  We're good to go.
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:29.802]  Order the book and DVD now for one low price.
[02:28:29.883 --> 02:28:31.964]  Get bulletproof asset protection now.
[02:28:32.265 --> 02:28:32.725]  Call them 888-240-3337.
[02:28:32.745 --> 02:28:33.325]  That's 888-240-3337.
[02:28:33.426 --> 02:28:35.147]  Or go to assetprotectionteam.com.
[02:28:35.167 --> 02:28:36.648]  Tell them you heard it on GCN.
[02:28:45.811 --> 02:28:54.074]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:54.334 --> 02:28:58.675]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.976 --> 02:29:07.879]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:08.099 --> 02:29:11.700]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:12.000 --> 02:29:17.028]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:17.328 --> 02:29:24.078]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:29:24.559 --> 02:29:25.099]  What about you?
[02:29:25.774 --> 02:29:26.935]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:27.075 --> 02:29:28.415]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.483 --> 02:29:48.844]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:30:15.354 --> 02:30:16.794]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:30:16.814 --> 02:30:20.795]  That's 1-800-516-8736 for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:30:20.815 --> 02:30:21.456]  It's free.
[02:30:21.596 --> 02:30:25.156]  Call now while operators are standing by to take your call.
[02:30:50.667 --> 02:30:52.568]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.048 --> 02:30:55.909]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:57.730 --> 02:31:02.272]  All right, I've only got time to take four more calls because I've got some news I want to run over that's very important.
[02:31:02.992 --> 02:31:04.373]  And I also have four little clips.
[02:31:05.367 --> 02:31:07.629]  These are these IBM ads you've heard so much about.
[02:31:07.669 --> 02:31:11.872]  And obviously, because they're video, you miss most of it.
[02:31:12.993 --> 02:31:18.097]  It gets lost in translation over an audio medium.
[02:31:19.078 --> 02:31:24.822]  But in one ad, oh, we were able to find you because everything in your truck and your packages is RFID tracked.
[02:31:24.842 --> 02:31:25.523]  Isn't it wonderful?
[02:31:25.603 --> 02:31:27.624]  And another ad, oh, cash is bad.
[02:31:27.644 --> 02:31:29.646]  The robber's busted to the top of the vault.
[02:31:29.706 --> 02:31:29.766]  And
[02:31:30.640 --> 02:31:37.529]  And then the person explains to them that cash is evil and causes identity fraud and causes theft, which is actually the opposite.
[02:31:37.549 --> 02:31:40.173]  And then they have other police state ads.
[02:31:40.894 --> 02:31:44.759]  So without further ado, let's go ahead and just roll these ads.
[02:31:44.819 --> 02:31:47.803]  Roll each one, then I'll comment on them briefly, and we'll roll the next one.
[02:31:47.823 --> 02:31:48.424]  Here's the first one.
[02:31:53.843 --> 02:31:55.864]  Would you kindly tell me what you're doing in the road?
[02:31:55.884 --> 02:31:56.905]  I'm with the help desk.
[02:31:57.365 --> 02:31:57.866]  You're lost.
[02:31:58.306 --> 02:31:59.287]  You're headed to Fresno.
[02:31:59.767 --> 02:32:00.508]  Fresno, right.
[02:32:00.928 --> 02:32:02.189]  This is the road to Albuquerque.
[02:32:02.369 --> 02:32:03.510]  How'd you know we were lost?
[02:32:04.110 --> 02:32:05.031]  The boxes told me.
[02:32:05.391 --> 02:32:05.931]  The boxes?
[02:32:06.371 --> 02:32:08.193]  RFID radio tags on the cargo.
[02:32:08.213 --> 02:32:10.014]  Helps track shipments.
[02:32:10.394 --> 02:32:11.795]  The boxes knew we were lost.
[02:32:12.015 --> 02:32:13.796]  Maybe the boxes should drive.
[02:32:14.517 --> 02:32:15.137]  Very funny.
[02:32:18.640 --> 02:32:20.841]  So, it just conditions you.
[02:32:21.121 --> 02:32:21.882]  Here's another one.
[02:32:28.945 --> 02:32:29.545]  You the help desk?
[02:32:29.565 --> 02:32:31.046]  That seems to be the problem, officer.
[02:32:31.186 --> 02:32:31.526]  Traffic.
[02:32:31.806 --> 02:32:32.107]  Traffic?
[02:32:32.187 --> 02:32:32.487]  Traffic.
[02:32:32.827 --> 02:32:33.347]  What do you need?
[02:32:33.447 --> 02:32:33.848]  What do you got?
[02:32:33.868 --> 02:32:36.529]  I got wireless sensors and congestion flow modeling.
[02:32:36.709 --> 02:32:37.169]  What'll it do?
[02:32:37.469 --> 02:32:38.190]  Cut down traffic.
[02:32:38.250 --> 02:32:38.730]  Will it work?
[02:32:39.230 --> 02:32:39.510]  Works.
[02:32:42.512 --> 02:32:45.013]  Nice work.
[02:32:45.393 --> 02:32:46.214]  Just doing my job.
[02:32:49.655 --> 02:32:50.076]  Alright.
[02:32:51.542 --> 02:32:52.262]  Yeah, have a nice day.
[02:32:52.282 --> 02:32:53.423]  The cop likes him.
[02:32:53.443 --> 02:32:54.063]  He's good.
[02:32:54.103 --> 02:32:57.504]  He's got RFID tracker chips and antennas everywhere tracking us.
[02:32:57.924 --> 02:33:00.005]  Meanwhile, Nationwide, they're announcing, oh, guess what?
[02:33:00.025 --> 02:33:01.926]  The cell phones that track you and listen to you?
[02:33:01.946 --> 02:33:17.531]  We're going to now track you with those real-time and raise new taxes to have it live time watching you off of the local FEMA command bases, known as emergency management centers that are really the new federal capitals, new federal command systems of each city.
[02:33:18.365 --> 02:33:19.346]  And I have a stack of articles.
[02:33:19.366 --> 02:33:19.927]  A stack.
[02:33:20.407 --> 02:33:30.197]  There's like four of them I have here where cell phones are tracking you and listening to you and going to text you and uses toll roads and the transponder readers are going and just everything we warned you.
[02:33:30.898 --> 02:33:33.761]  Lots of little cutesy-tootsy Nazi IBM ads.
[02:33:33.781 --> 02:33:38.406]  Remember, they're the ones that ran the little tattoos on the Jews and other victims of the Nazis.
[02:33:39.067 --> 02:33:40.029]  Here's another one for you.
[02:33:51.084 --> 02:33:51.984]  Is this the office?
[02:33:52.004 --> 02:33:52.404]  Yes, it is.
[02:33:52.585 --> 02:33:53.225]  Maximo's worried.
[02:33:53.465 --> 02:33:54.065]  Who's Maximo?
[02:33:54.265 --> 02:33:54.925]  I am Maximo.
[02:33:54.945 --> 02:33:55.626]  Why are you worried?
[02:33:55.726 --> 02:33:56.066]  Feathers.
[02:33:56.326 --> 02:33:56.646]  Feathers?
[02:33:56.806 --> 02:33:57.286]  Feathers!
[02:33:57.366 --> 02:33:58.447]  Will they sell?
[02:33:58.747 --> 02:33:59.407]  I'm afraid not.
[02:33:59.587 --> 02:34:00.387]  Well, how do you know?
[02:34:00.727 --> 02:34:03.148]  Mining data from sales, news, blogs.
[02:34:03.348 --> 02:34:04.048]  Mining blogs?
[02:34:04.108 --> 02:34:05.469]  Where is this blog mine?
[02:34:05.529 --> 02:34:06.049]  I know data.
[02:34:06.369 --> 02:34:06.989]  Trend spotting.
[02:34:07.209 --> 02:34:07.730]  What is it?
[02:34:08.250 --> 02:34:08.850]  Feathers are over.
[02:34:10.791 --> 02:34:12.091]  Then Maximo's over!
[02:34:12.271 --> 02:34:12.631]  One word.
[02:34:13.291 --> 02:34:13.572]  Chiffon.
[02:34:14.012 --> 02:34:14.492]  Chiffon?
[02:34:17.033 --> 02:34:17.393]  Okay.
[02:34:18.212 --> 02:34:24.834]  And so what that is, is they're advertising the Total Information Awareness Network saying private companies, you will be able to go buy from that.
[02:34:24.854 --> 02:34:27.695]  Of course, they'll give you faulty data and won't give you the real streams.
[02:34:28.135 --> 02:34:39.599]  That's what the NSA's been doing for 30 years with these keywords, is picking out the trends and then guiding the trends and really societally manipulating you and trying to stay one step ahead of us.
[02:34:39.619 --> 02:34:43.040]  So there, they're flaunting total data mining right in front of you.
[02:34:43.640 --> 02:34:45.080]  And then I think we're going to play one more clip.
[02:34:45.100 --> 02:34:46.721]  This next one, I think, is where they bust into the...
[02:34:48.407 --> 02:34:57.449]  Vault, and cash is evil, so there's no cash, so that saves the bank from the evil robbers, who then announce themselves as the cleaning crew.
[02:34:57.469 --> 02:34:57.750]  Here it is.
[02:35:05.498 --> 02:35:06.359]  There's no money here.
[02:35:06.940 --> 02:35:07.861]  There's no money?
[02:35:08.081 --> 02:35:08.482]  No money.
[02:35:08.762 --> 02:35:09.323]  Where is it?
[02:35:09.423 --> 02:35:10.104]  Somewhere safe.
[02:35:10.685 --> 02:35:11.566]  This is the safe.
[02:35:11.906 --> 02:35:12.647]  Somewhere safer.
[02:35:12.948 --> 02:35:13.428]  Safer?
[02:35:13.589 --> 02:35:13.909]  How?
[02:35:14.209 --> 02:35:17.414]  Hardware encryption, smart cards, you know, digital security.
[02:35:17.514 --> 02:35:18.235]  Who are you?
[02:35:18.715 --> 02:35:19.396]  I'm from the help desk.
[02:35:19.436 --> 02:35:20.177]  Who are you?
[02:35:21.519 --> 02:35:22.080]  Cleaning crew?
[02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:23.542]  This place is a mess.
[02:35:25.487 --> 02:35:26.548]  Isn't it so nice of them?
[02:35:26.588 --> 02:35:38.276]  They're going to run everything for us and watch us and control us with chips in all our new visas and MasterCards and chips in our IDs and chips in our cars and chips in the inspection stickers and our phones listening to us.
[02:35:38.756 --> 02:35:39.717]  They're going to run it.
[02:35:39.797 --> 02:35:41.158]  They're going to help you.
[02:35:42.293 --> 02:35:43.413]  That's what IBM does.
[02:35:43.474 --> 02:35:46.315]  It's bought up thousands of little companies, and they're their fronts.
[02:35:46.735 --> 02:35:51.057]  Applied Digital is owned through its stock and debt by IBM.
[02:35:51.377 --> 02:35:53.297]  Then they take all the heat sand, take chips.
[02:35:53.337 --> 02:35:53.918]  Chips are good.
[02:35:53.938 --> 02:35:55.498]  They hire Tommy Thompson.
[02:35:55.538 --> 02:35:58.339]  They have Sean Hannity out saying every child needs a chip.
[02:35:58.700 --> 02:36:01.541]  And then IBM does it through literally thousands of tentacles.
[02:36:01.661 --> 02:36:02.681]  Totally evil.
[02:36:03.161 --> 02:36:04.202]  Totally evil.
[02:36:05.302 --> 02:36:07.363]  And all this is is mass conditioning.
[02:36:08.798 --> 02:36:18.943]  Of course, in the real world, the crooks are the global banks, and if you're not a good little globalist, they just drain your bank account, or they allow their little criminal syndicates to do it, or real live criminals do it.
[02:36:19.304 --> 02:36:25.607]  It's the big companies selling and sharing data that is responsible for 80 plus percent of the identity theft.
[02:36:25.867 --> 02:36:33.111]  That's the official numbers, but the media they own always tells you it's just using the internet or stuff not being totally controlled by Big Brother.
[02:36:35.197 --> 02:36:53.413]  All right, before I just rampage through four calls, all I have time for, sorry to the other people, before I go to these final calls from Ron, Mike, Gil, Charles, and that's it, before I do that, we're not going to go to the calls yet.
[02:36:53.433 --> 02:36:57.256]  I was saying before we do that, see, this is my life, folks.
[02:36:57.376 --> 02:36:58.958]  I'm on remote every day.
[02:36:58.978 --> 02:37:00.559]  I heard that savage dog in the background.
[02:37:01.079 --> 02:37:01.580]  Sounds vicious.
[02:37:02.387 --> 02:37:03.448]  I'm not here in Austin.
[02:37:03.689 --> 02:37:09.154]  When I say go to the calls, they go to the calls up in Minnesota, so I guess they didn't understand my little order there.
[02:37:09.515 --> 02:37:10.095]  That's okay.
[02:37:10.115 --> 02:37:13.639]  Let me go back to what I was trying to say.
[02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:16.142]  My new video is out, The Order of Death.
[02:37:16.222 --> 02:37:17.323]  You need to have it.
[02:37:18.484 --> 02:37:20.966]  44-minute documentary getting into the Illuminati.
[02:37:21.046 --> 02:37:22.947]  Satan worship openly exposed.
[02:37:22.967 --> 02:37:40.059]  And the new footage shot this year inside the Owl, the effigy of the camp, inside the Mandalay's main encampment, inside the Chateau where the Star Wars program was engineered, Strategic Defense Initiative, as well as the Manhattan Project.
[02:37:40.985 --> 02:37:46.168]  And locals doing their own rituals, trying to battle with the Grovers in some type of weird Harry Potter behavior.
[02:37:46.809 --> 02:37:47.629]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:37:48.189 --> 02:37:54.073]  And then the Illuminati connections to the Ku Klux Klan and what's currently happening with masonry in this country.
[02:37:54.713 --> 02:37:57.114]  And then the original Dark Secrets of the Side Bohemian Grove.
[02:37:57.135 --> 02:37:57.735]  We re-edited it.
[02:37:58.746 --> 02:38:02.708]  Remastered it, updated it, and cut it down from over two hours to an hour and a half.
[02:38:03.328 --> 02:38:08.971]  Both those films on one DVD or one VHS for $24.95, the price of normally one film.
[02:38:09.252 --> 02:38:11.313]  And then each additional copy for the first of the year, $9.95.
[02:38:12.173 --> 02:38:11.313]  $9.95!
[02:38:12.593 --> 02:38:19.197]  To get a couple extra copies to give as gifts this holiday season, this Christmas season.
[02:38:20.806 --> 02:38:22.488]  And I hope you'll get Martial Law.
[02:38:22.528 --> 02:38:23.549]  It's my best video.
[02:38:23.569 --> 02:38:24.250]  It's just amazing.
[02:38:24.270 --> 02:38:26.172]  And then Road to Tyranny and American Dictators.
[02:38:26.552 --> 02:38:28.374]  We've got a whole bunch of new specials.
[02:38:28.495 --> 02:38:29.476]  Everything's discounted.
[02:38:29.816 --> 02:38:31.218]  T-shirts instead of $20 or $9.95.
[02:38:31.438 --> 02:38:33.260]  Any T-shirt, any size.
[02:38:33.680 --> 02:38:35.102]  Made in America, by the way.

[02:39:11.576 --> 02:39:13.677]  A great gift to give, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:39:14.197 --> 02:39:18.619]  Or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:39:24.947 --> 02:39:27.349]  And we ship out UPS ground.
[02:39:27.609 --> 02:39:30.211]  Normally it takes about three days anywhere in the country, sometimes five days.
[02:39:30.952 --> 02:39:39.059]  We are caught up to... We got about a week behind in shipping lately because I had some folks that were out or people that were sick here at the office.
[02:39:39.099 --> 02:39:43.702]  But we are right up to shipping out about a day after we get your order.
[02:39:43.722 --> 02:39:49.887]  And we're going to try to, as we get up towards December 20th, to get up to shipping out the day the order comes in.
[02:39:50.808 --> 02:39:54.211]  Of course, if your order comes in at 6 o'clock and we're all gone, it's going to go out the next day.
[02:39:55.448 --> 02:39:57.753]  Or if somebody's sick and isn't here, it'll go out the next day.
[02:39:57.793 --> 02:40:02.703]  But we're getting it right up right now to the day, shipping out the day the order comes in.
[02:40:03.365 --> 02:40:05.068]  And so if you order by the 19th or the 20th...
[02:40:06.651 --> 02:40:07.112]  We're good to go.
[02:40:35.027 --> 02:40:38.269]  And there can be your little order form in there.
[02:40:38.729 --> 02:40:43.091]  If you'd like, be sure to specify in the comments section with your little note to them.
[02:40:43.211 --> 02:40:46.492]  So you can do that, too, at InfoWars.com.
[02:40:47.032 --> 02:40:50.974]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:40:51.294 --> 02:40:55.976]  And I would say the cutoff date's about now for writing to us.
[02:40:55.996 --> 02:41:00.998]  If you want to write to us today, we should get it in time to mail it off to you and get it by Christmas.
[02:41:01.779 --> 02:41:02.139]  And that's...
[02:41:03.357 --> 02:41:13.420]  Write to Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:41:13.620 --> 02:41:21.582]  And we ship by UPS, unless you ask, and then you can get it by USPS, but they're just awful.
[02:41:21.982 --> 02:41:23.043]  We ship priority mail.
[02:41:23.163 --> 02:41:24.943]  It does not get there in three days, like they say.
[02:41:25.243 --> 02:41:26.624]  That is a complete lie.
[02:41:26.884 --> 02:41:28.504]  I'd say the average is about seven days.
[02:41:29.664 --> 02:41:30.625]  So there, I told you.
[02:41:30.645 --> 02:41:31.825]  But if you want USPS...
[02:41:32.532 --> 02:41:34.753]  You can certainly have it if that's what you want.
[02:41:34.773 --> 02:41:36.233]  UPS is great, we found.
[02:41:37.093 --> 02:41:40.334]  All right, let's go ahead and I'm going to go fast here.
[02:41:40.974 --> 02:41:42.194]  There's still some news I've got ahead.
[02:41:43.054 --> 02:41:43.795]  Ron in New York.
[02:41:43.875 --> 02:41:44.495]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:41:45.435 --> 02:41:45.955]  Yes, Alex.
[02:41:47.035 --> 02:41:49.216]  Alex, what I'm calling about today is a New York story.
[02:41:49.256 --> 02:41:54.317]  I don't know that it's being played in the national media, but it's sure being played in the New York media, particularly on our newspapers.
[02:41:55.256 --> 02:42:04.282]  We've had two tragic shootings of police officers, I guess, over the course of about the last two weeks here, and we have a governor who's supposed to be a... But you have massive gun control.
[02:42:04.302 --> 02:42:05.863]  You should be a land of milk and honey.
[02:42:06.444 --> 02:42:07.184]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:42:07.244 --> 02:42:16.891]  Instead of a society and a culture of violence with a bad chip on its shoulder, because that's what New York is, in spite of all the fraudulent statistics that are being reported out of New York.
[02:42:16.911 --> 02:42:17.951]  So what's happening in New York?
[02:42:17.992 --> 02:42:18.312]  Tell us.
[02:42:20.352 --> 02:42:36.629]  We have a governor who's trying to posture himself to look conservative by really introducing gun control, but calling it crime control, and then criticizing, you know, what I guess he would deem the evil liberals on the opposite side of the political aisle.
[02:42:37.307 --> 02:42:37.987]  This is crazy.
[02:42:38.007 --> 02:42:43.391]  What's going on here is a big... Yeah, Pataki openly wants to shut down all gun manufacturers by letting the state sue them.
[02:42:43.751 --> 02:42:44.892]  He's a total piece of filth.
[02:42:45.072 --> 02:42:45.872]  Neocons love him.
[02:42:46.233 --> 02:42:47.173]  But this is what I'm saying.
[02:42:47.213 --> 02:42:49.555]  The way he gets the, you know, the New York... No, I know.
[02:42:49.655 --> 02:42:51.436]  Not handing your guns in is liberal.
[02:42:51.476 --> 02:42:52.477]  No, I understand.
[02:42:52.817 --> 02:42:53.737]  I'm liberal, sir.
[02:42:54.198 --> 02:42:55.178]  This is what he's doing.
[02:42:55.218 --> 02:42:58.480]  He's playing it off that way, that like it's... No, I'm well aware of it.
[02:42:58.500 --> 02:42:59.381]  I did see the reports.
[02:42:59.401 --> 02:43:00.041]  Yeah, he's horrible.
[02:43:00.382 --> 02:43:02.583]  The evil liberals, you know, are the ones doing this.
[02:43:02.683 --> 02:43:05.645]  And the dummies in this state, the neocon worshipers...
[02:43:06.195 --> 02:43:07.356]  You know, that we have in this state.
[02:43:07.396 --> 02:43:08.657]  They're just drooling and stupid.
[02:43:09.137 --> 02:43:10.098]  They go along with this.
[02:43:10.138 --> 02:43:16.163]  Now, the fact of the matter remains, you want to know what causes the illegal trafficking guns in this state, and I'm telling you this is formal law enforcement.
[02:43:16.363 --> 02:43:17.784]  It's by making them illegal.
[02:43:18.484 --> 02:43:27.847]  By the fact that they do not have anything even approaching a reasonable process by which a law-abiding citizen could obtain a weapon in this state to protect himself.
[02:43:27.887 --> 02:43:33.949]  It makes you a haven, and so it puts money into, by making the guns illegal, it makes it a black market.
[02:43:34.009 --> 02:43:41.232]  If you make liquor illegal, drinking triples and alcohol poisoning quadruples and crime gangs explode, it's the same thing every time.
[02:43:41.252 --> 02:43:41.992]  Same principle.
[02:43:42.052 --> 02:43:46.614]  Well, it does attract, well, I'll admit, the illegal trade in weapons does attract an unsavory element.
[02:43:47.074 --> 02:43:59.818]  The fact of the matter is, probably six of every ten illegal guns sold in this city are sold to decent people who are afraid of crime in this city or in this state and have no other means by which to protect themselves.
[02:44:00.238 --> 02:44:04.539]  Please, I ask the rest of the listeners from the other 49 states not to be fooled by that.
[02:44:05.080 --> 02:44:06.160]  They should understand that.
[02:44:07.051 --> 02:44:15.157]  Those people who possess weapons in states, let's say out west or down south, in New York, particularly in the city of New York, would never be permitted to possess a weapon.
[02:44:15.197 --> 02:44:17.718]  Well, I hear you, and I appreciate your call.
[02:44:17.778 --> 02:44:20.140]  They just banned guns, period, in San Francisco.
[02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:25.243]  Arnold's banning many different types of ammo in California.
[02:44:25.263 --> 02:44:26.224]  I mean, it's hell on earth.
[02:44:27.085 --> 02:44:32.588]  Bush is running around thumbing at the mouth, appointing anti-gun judges everywhere, and being hailed for it.
[02:44:33.269 --> 02:44:36.111]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here?
[02:44:37.094 --> 02:44:37.934]  Mike in Cleveland.
[02:44:37.954 --> 02:44:38.655]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:44:39.435 --> 02:44:39.895]  Hey, Alex.
[02:44:39.915 --> 02:44:40.356]  How you doing?
[02:44:40.596 --> 02:44:41.216]  Good, my friend.
[02:44:41.416 --> 02:44:43.377]  Hey, I just had a question for you.
[02:44:43.537 --> 02:44:56.203]  You, in your video, Order of Death, it says that when you put it in there, it had that Bush was part of the Bohemian Grove ritual that they do.
[02:44:56.484 --> 02:45:03.407]  But you said earlier in the broadcast today that sitting presidents do not attend the ritual while they're sitting presidents.
[02:45:04.145 --> 02:45:06.068]  I don't understand how that's confusing to you.
[02:45:06.128 --> 02:45:10.734]  It's like saying, I've been to Disneyland before but I didn't go this year.
[02:45:11.595 --> 02:45:17.042]  But on the list in your video, it says that he was a current member of this year's attendees.
[02:45:17.549 --> 02:45:20.672]  Along with his father and Colin Powell and whoever else was on that show.
[02:45:20.692 --> 02:45:21.753]  Yes, Bush is in there.
[02:45:21.793 --> 02:45:23.034]  I'm saying they don't go.
[02:45:23.755 --> 02:45:27.358]  Actually, we think he went this year, but we can't prove it.
[02:45:27.698 --> 02:45:28.959]  Because he was in the area.
[02:45:29.340 --> 02:45:30.601]  He was in Sonoma County.
[02:45:30.621 --> 02:45:32.883]  He was supposed to be in another business and disappeared one night.
[02:45:33.003 --> 02:45:33.483]  Oh, he was?
[02:45:33.884 --> 02:45:39.088]  Yes, but we have photos from our own annals of him and his father together giving speeches.
[02:45:39.128 --> 02:45:39.809]  That's in the film.
[02:45:40.429 --> 02:45:43.871]  It's not debatable that he goes there and that he's a member and that he's been part of it.
[02:45:43.891 --> 02:45:45.671]  Well, I'm not debating that he isn't a member.
[02:45:45.691 --> 02:45:47.132]  No, I totally believe that, Alex.
[02:45:47.192 --> 02:45:48.593]  I mean, that's just crazy.
[02:45:48.993 --> 02:45:50.534]  He goes to a place of the devil worship.
[02:45:50.734 --> 02:45:51.334]  I mean, come on.
[02:45:51.714 --> 02:45:52.915]  But I'm trying to understand.
[02:45:52.935 --> 02:45:56.356]  When I say that he's a member, yes, they're members.
[02:45:56.396 --> 02:46:02.739]  It's like Richard Nixon was a member, but reportedly he didn't go there for the six and a half, seven years he was president.
[02:46:03.099 --> 02:46:07.801]  But the list that you have in your video from your source, Kyle, okay?
[02:46:08.957 --> 02:46:13.000]  It listed all the people who went to the ritual or just people who attended this year?
[02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:14.581]  People who attend the Grove, sir.
[02:46:14.801 --> 02:46:15.642]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:46:15.662 --> 02:46:16.282]  I apologize.
[02:46:16.302 --> 02:46:17.884]  And then I have another question for you.
[02:46:18.744 --> 02:46:24.388]  You know about Werner Von Braun and his four points before he died that he related to his biographer?
[02:46:25.296 --> 02:46:34.639]  And the four points are... I know about the Nazi rocketry head who then became the head of our NASA program, both unmanned man, both classified and unclassified.
[02:46:34.919 --> 02:46:35.159]  Right.
[02:46:35.279 --> 02:46:36.159]  What were his four points?
[02:46:36.179 --> 02:46:46.522]  The four points, before he died, he gave to his biographer, Carol Rosen, and basically he said there's a four-point plan to control the population of the planet.
[02:46:47.082 --> 02:46:49.423]  And one of them was Cold War.
[02:46:49.983 --> 02:46:53.264]  The next one was a rogue state.
[02:46:54.076 --> 02:46:55.716]  Next was terrorists, next was aliens.
[02:46:55.936 --> 02:46:56.196]  Right.
[02:46:56.597 --> 02:46:59.837]  And I think you should pump that more to people.
[02:46:59.957 --> 02:47:00.977]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:47:00.997 --> 02:47:02.418]  I haven't read the biography myself.
[02:47:02.478 --> 02:47:02.898]  I've heard that.
[02:47:02.918 --> 02:47:03.478]  Thanks for the call.
[02:47:03.918 --> 02:47:04.458]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:04.518 --> 02:47:06.998]  One final caller because I want to come back and have a few final news items.
[02:47:07.959 --> 02:47:09.599]  Let's go to Gil in Texas.
[02:47:09.639 --> 02:47:10.219]  Gil, go ahead.
[02:47:10.579 --> 02:47:13.740]  Yeah, very timely information, especially on the RFID.
[02:47:13.980 --> 02:47:16.620]  One of the networks just ran an ad for home again.
[02:47:16.680 --> 02:47:18.321]  It's the tag you put in your animal.
[02:47:19.181 --> 02:47:20.261]  I have two quick questions.
[02:47:20.931 --> 02:47:27.634]  The first question has concerning all these FEMA benefits, like billions of dollars sent down here to the Gulf Coast.
[02:47:27.654 --> 02:47:30.815]  You think that's going to affect how people have faith in the government, Alex?
[02:47:31.796 --> 02:47:35.077]  Well, it's hundreds of billions basically just to pay off their cronies and buddies.
[02:47:35.097 --> 02:47:36.218]  They don't even care what we think.
[02:47:36.638 --> 02:47:38.779]  What about the citizens that are getting these entitlements?
[02:47:38.799 --> 02:47:41.780]  You think they're going to be swayed to deal with FEMA and love FEMA?
[02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:44.221]  Yes, we're all learning that FEMA's our God.
[02:47:44.601 --> 02:47:45.101]  Oh, boy.
[02:47:45.341 --> 02:47:48.703]  And the second part of my question is back out to California and Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:47:48.723 --> 02:47:49.023]  Tonight...
[02:47:49.639 --> 02:47:52.641]  There's a scheduled execution of Stanley Tukey Williams.
[02:47:52.661 --> 02:47:59.725]  You think this might be something that they might use to inflame the largely Hispanic population over there?
[02:47:59.765 --> 02:48:01.305]  Should they give him a stay of execution?
[02:48:02.566 --> 02:48:04.247]  Well, Tukey did kill a lot of people.
[02:48:04.287 --> 02:48:05.288]  He's been convicted of it.
[02:48:05.488 --> 02:48:09.470]  And I think the media hyping it up, talking about riots is going to cause it.
[02:48:10.032 --> 02:48:13.114]  And if it does happen, they'll just use it as more police state control.
[02:48:13.134 --> 02:48:14.695]  How do you think they're going to play it?
[02:48:14.715 --> 02:48:16.396]  Are they going to kill him or are they going to let him?
[02:48:16.536 --> 02:48:17.997]  I mean, I'm trying to understand.
[02:48:18.017 --> 02:48:20.419]  You know, if I had to guess, I think Schwarzenegger is going to say kill him.
[02:48:20.779 --> 02:48:21.660]  I think so, too.
[02:48:21.700 --> 02:48:22.720]  But what if they give him a say?
[02:48:22.740 --> 02:48:24.962]  You think that will inflame the Hispanic community down there?
[02:48:26.923 --> 02:48:27.703]  Yeah, probably.
[02:48:27.723 --> 02:48:28.724]  Oh, boy.
[02:48:28.864 --> 02:48:29.465]  God help us.
[02:48:29.645 --> 02:48:30.025]  Bye-bye.
[02:48:30.385 --> 02:48:31.106]  Yeah, take care.
[02:48:31.406 --> 02:48:36.229]  You know, Tukey, everybody's talking about Tukey today.
[02:48:36.249 --> 02:48:37.750]  And I just...
[02:48:40.435 --> 02:48:42.056]  That's a whole other ball of wax.
[02:48:42.076 --> 02:48:42.817]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:54.027]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.287 --> 02:48:59.032]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.252 --> 02:49:04.897]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.117 --> 02:49:09.638]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:09.858 --> 02:49:17.020]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:17.040 --> 02:49:21.541]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.741 --> 02:49:24.241]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.481 --> 02:49:31.183]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:49:58.850 --> 02:50:03.535]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.995 --> 02:50:10.718]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:11.098 --> 02:50:22.903]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:23.363 --> 02:50:27.825]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:51:45.967 --> 02:51:51.772]  We've got our own comments on this on InfoWars.com.
[02:51:52.593 --> 02:51:56.396]  Paul Watson's written an article about it, but you can read Doug Thompson's Capitol Hill Blues story about it.
[02:51:58.171 --> 02:52:09.086]  Last week they had a bunch of congressional leaders and other individuals and top staffers in a big roundtable discussion, and they were telling Bush that he was going to anger conservatives.
[02:52:10.726 --> 02:52:20.736]  That he was trying to push through the reauthorization and expansion of the Patriot Act, and Bush said, I don't give a GED, Bush retorted, I'm the President, and the Commander-in-Chief do it my way.
[02:52:21.257 --> 02:52:27.263]  Mr. President, one aide is in the meeting, said, there is a valid case that the provisions in the law undermine the Constitution.
[02:52:27.664 --> 02:52:32.149]  Stop throwing the Constitution in my face, Bush screamed back, it's just a GED piece of paper.
[02:52:33.704 --> 02:52:37.767]  And everything they've ever reported has been confirmed.
[02:52:38.348 --> 02:52:40.710]  It just shows the insane mentality of these people.
[02:52:41.270 --> 02:52:49.316]  And remember, Alberto Gonzalez in published memos says Bush is the law, that the Constitution is outdated, a quaint piece of paper.
[02:52:49.336 --> 02:52:51.558]  I mean, they just spit on it.
[02:52:52.819 --> 02:52:55.241]  Just basic freedoms, folks, basic liberties.
[02:52:56.781 --> 02:52:58.703]  FDA Paxil linked to birth defects.
[02:52:58.943 --> 02:53:08.834]  FDA warned doctors today that preliminary results, there have been many studies, implicate the antidepressant Paxil, paroxetine, with an increased risk of birth defects.
[02:53:08.894 --> 02:53:18.924]  The FDA informed doctors the results of these studies suggest Paxil use during the first trimester increases the risk of congenital heart defects and the developing fetus, one of many.
[02:53:20.825 --> 02:53:22.406]  And that's the whitewash.
[02:53:22.446 --> 02:53:24.247]  Here is London Telegraph.
[02:53:24.267 --> 02:53:26.829]  Doctors told not to prescribe Cerarat.
[02:53:27.229 --> 02:53:32.132]  Doctors have been warned not to give pregnant women a leading antidepressant drug because it may cause birth defects.
[02:53:32.152 --> 02:53:41.077]  The move follows evidence from Sweden that suggests women who took the drug sold in Britain during early pregnancy were twice as likely to give birth to a child with a heart defect.
[02:53:41.397 --> 02:53:43.018]  So it gets the same chemical in all of these.
[02:53:43.499 --> 02:53:44.880]  Different companies, different chemicals.
[02:53:45.660 --> 02:53:47.501]  And then there's a big UPI article here.
[02:53:47.541 --> 02:53:48.782]  I should have spent all day on this.
[02:53:50.396 --> 02:53:53.939]  Where they looked at all these Amish communities with zero autism.
[02:53:53.959 --> 02:53:55.200]  That's when they're independently tested.
[02:53:55.641 --> 02:54:02.767]  And then there's the Home First Health Services in Metropolitan Chicago keeping a record of all the parents that have refused to vaccinate.
[02:54:03.948 --> 02:54:12.676]  And out of 35,000 children, not one of them that has been vaccinated has autism.
[02:54:13.216 --> 02:54:16.099]  And then the children that come to them that are, then they see a 1 in 166
[02:54:18.457 --> 02:54:23.860]  Up from one in 2000, or no, 2400, 25 years ago.
[02:54:24.701 --> 02:54:26.562]  And so now it's one in 166.
[02:54:26.602 --> 02:54:31.925]  And it says you don't have to be an Einstein.
[02:54:32.486 --> 02:54:33.366]  It just goes on and on.
[02:54:33.386 --> 02:54:35.427]  I don't have time to cover it all and babble through it.
[02:54:36.648 --> 02:54:37.709]  But there it is.
[02:54:38.593 --> 02:54:41.175]  Just more proof on top of proof.
[02:54:41.195 --> 02:54:46.559]  I mean, look, mercury is one of the most destructive heavy metals in the brain.
[02:54:46.639 --> 02:54:49.061]  It just zaps your brain cells.
[02:54:49.101 --> 02:54:56.107]  We've even posted electron microscope video of what low-level mercury does when it hits the cerebral cortex.
[02:54:56.167 --> 02:54:57.488]  It is a lobotomy.
[02:54:58.309 --> 02:55:01.931]  And most children just get a nice IQ reduction, as the globalists would like.
[02:55:02.892 --> 02:55:04.433]  That's the actual plan from it.
[02:55:05.134 --> 02:55:07.156]  But others, you get a...
[02:55:08.734 --> 02:55:10.375]  The development of lesions on the brain.
[02:55:11.475 --> 02:55:16.517]  And babies will have convulsions on the spot, and they'll just arrest the parents and claim they beat them.
[02:55:17.377 --> 02:55:18.597]  Even when it's in the hospital.
[02:55:18.637 --> 02:55:25.520]  See, the globalists are so evil that they didn't even come up with other plans for after they abuse you, then they imprison you.
[02:55:26.000 --> 02:55:28.141]  Or take your kid and hop them up on even more drugs.
[02:55:29.201 --> 02:55:31.642]  Five times more likely to be abused in government custody.
[02:55:31.682 --> 02:55:32.402]  Fed's on numbers.
[02:55:32.422 --> 02:55:35.423]  Just remember that when you're up on your high and mighty podium.
[02:55:37.529 --> 02:55:38.249]  I'm out of time.
[02:55:38.369 --> 02:55:41.651]  I want to thank all of the listeners for tuning in, putting up with us.
[02:55:41.671 --> 02:55:48.415]  I want to thank all our affiliates, our sponsors, the folks that run the show up in Minnesota, my crew down here in Austin, Texas.
[02:55:49.996 --> 02:55:57.820]  And I want to tell you that Morgan Reynolds, the chief economist for one of the major agencies for the current Bush administration...
[02:55:59.061 --> 02:56:09.206]  Talking about government involvement in 9-11, Morgan Reynolds, who we first interviewed, I would add, a little bit proud of that, will be joining us again for his second visit.
[02:56:10.107 --> 02:56:12.468]  I guess it will be his third visit coming up tomorrow.
[02:56:12.848 --> 02:56:16.030]  Just incredible guests all week, and your calls, and tons of news.
