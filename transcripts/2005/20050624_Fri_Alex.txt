[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:03.671]  We're good to go.
[00:00:04.091 --> 00:00:06.892]  We're good to go.
[00:00:30.442 --> 00:00:34.024]  Boy, I tell you, I am raring to go today.
[00:00:34.824 --> 00:00:40.266]  It is Friday, the 24th day of June 2005.
[00:00:41.247 --> 00:00:52.672]  What a wonderful crowd we had last night at the Alamo Draft House for the fifth sellout showing of my new film, Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:00:53.232 --> 00:00:57.374]  And I was humbled by folks that flew in from New Jersey...
[00:00:58.551 --> 00:01:05.415]  From Hawaii, you name it, to see the show, to see the film.
[00:01:05.596 --> 00:01:07.357]  I'm just absolutely humbled.
[00:01:07.397 --> 00:01:19.924]  I mean, I thought somebody coming from Nebraska was far away a few weeks ago, but to come from as far away as Hawaii, Maui, it was great.
[00:01:19.984 --> 00:01:21.525]  So I want to say hi to those folks.
[00:01:21.585 --> 00:01:26.088]  Never thanked them during my speech for coming, so I thought I'd do it on air.
[00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:29.773]  All right, I have dispensed with the pleasantries.
[00:01:31.173 --> 00:01:33.114]  Let's plunge into the news.
[00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:48.198]  Lou Dobbs last night had a poll, and 99% of the tens of thousands of respondents said they were against this un-American, unimaginable ruling by the Supreme Court.
[00:01:48.258 --> 00:01:53.119]  By the way, even in Saddam Hussein's Iraq, if you owned your property, you owned it.
[00:01:55.544 --> 00:02:06.411]  In many cases, it's almost unheard of, even in countries that are dictatorships, to say we're going to tear up a whole neighborhood because some developers want to build something.
[00:02:07.092 --> 00:02:09.233]  I mean, this just isn't un-American.
[00:02:09.273 --> 00:02:10.994]  This is inhuman.
[00:02:11.074 --> 00:02:21.521]  This is not just butchering the Bill of Rights, but the Magna Carta and the Ten Commandments and just basic common decency.
[00:02:22.512 --> 00:02:30.439]  Unleashing the bankers and the robber barons and the land barons to steal your property and not even give you best price for it.
[00:02:32.741 --> 00:02:34.723]  So this is just incredible.
[00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:48.736]  I wrote a little article about this this morning that's just gone up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and I think it spells it out nicely and I'll be reading that article I wrote coming up here after the break.
[00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:52.159]  But I say let it come.
[00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:53.620]  Let them take the mask off.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.200]  Show us who you really are.
[00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.441]  Let's get it on.
[00:02:57.541 --> 00:02:58.361]  It's a good thing.
[00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:05.463]  They've been stealing property for the last 20, 30 years just pell-mell, using a bunch of different excuses.
[00:03:06.363 --> 00:03:08.344]  And now they're just doing it out in the open.
[00:03:09.044 --> 00:03:13.185]  I mean, it's better than cops going and planting drugs on somebody's ranch.
[00:03:13.645 --> 00:03:15.286]  You've even gotten the documents where cops...
[00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:20.174]  Are so criminal, out in California in one case, they have memos.
[00:03:20.254 --> 00:03:27.378]  Yeah, we plant drugs on him, we'll get his 500-acre ranch worth $20 million, and we'll be able to sell it for development.
[00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:33.863]  He's refused to sell it to developers, but once we plant drugs on him, well, the guy, when the cops busted in, thought they were robbers.
[00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:35.944]  He didn't use drugs, no criminal record.
[00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:39.206]  They gunned him down and got the property.
[00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:41.847]  So, isn't that just special?
[00:03:41.887 --> 00:03:43.127]  Isn't that just darling?
[00:03:43.167 --> 00:03:44.228]  Isn't that just sweet?
[00:03:45.008 --> 00:03:48.269]  So, I mean, at least now they may not kill us when they want the property.
[00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.750]  This is plain and simple criminality.
[00:03:52.171 --> 00:03:54.772]  Bottom line, you want despotism, you want tyranny.
[00:03:55.032 --> 00:03:56.232]  Oh, and they're not going to stop here.
[00:03:58.273 --> 00:04:03.935]  The courts are ruling that, and the FDA is ruling that they can put, you know, clone food on store shelves.
[00:04:03.975 --> 00:04:07.116]  They're ruling that mercury is nutritious.
[00:04:07.136 --> 00:04:09.277]  I mean, because they say it's good, it's good.
[00:04:11.141 --> 00:04:14.224]  It's like Karl Rove told a New York Times writer last year.
[00:04:14.264 --> 00:04:16.445]  He said, look, we control reality.
[00:04:17.626 --> 00:04:26.834]  All of you just look in on what we're doing, history's actors, and you may study what we say today, but then we'll change reality tomorrow.
[00:04:27.555 --> 00:04:29.997]  Well, that's delusional thinking, Mr. Rove.
[00:04:30.597 --> 00:04:35.261]  Reality's going to crash in on you in Iraq, and it's going to crash in on you here.
[00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.224]  Bush, by the way, is giving a press conference right now.
[00:04:39.096 --> 00:04:53.269]  I hope to high heaven that this broadcast is not being granted by some stations to carry the drivel, but I did take some notes on it before I went on air, and you can just hear the desperate tinge in his voice, so look out!
[00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.973]  There might be some government-sponsored terror to teach you how to love your abusers.
[00:04:58.994 --> 00:05:01.877]  PrisonPlanet.tv and FullWars.com, stay with us.
[00:05:03.692 --> 00:05:08.036]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:08.216 --> 00:05:12.640]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.163]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:17.203 --> 00:05:18.565]  The New World Order.
[00:05:20.347 --> 00:05:24.571]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:24.631 --> 00:05:31.579]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:33.702]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:34.062 --> 00:05:44.466]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:44.686 --> 00:05:50.048]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:50.568 --> 00:05:53.229]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:24.559]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:30.602]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:06:30.862 --> 00:06:31.362]  We're good to go.
[00:06:53.493 --> 00:06:54.934]  Call New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:55.495 --> 00:06:58.797]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:58.998 --> 00:07:01.199]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:03.241 --> 00:07:08.966]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine, and I want to tell you about the Sackville Wedgie.
[00:07:09.526 --> 00:07:11.928]  I don't endorse many products, but I'm endorsing this one.
[00:07:12.228 --> 00:07:19.314]  If you've got back pain, sciatica, hip pain, leg pain, knee pain, then you need to listen very closely to this message.
[00:07:19.761 --> 00:07:27.863]  For more than 10 years now, the Sacro Wedgie has helped thousands find relief from the symptoms and pain of back problems.
[00:07:28.203 --> 00:07:30.104]  Now all you have to do is go to their website.

[00:07:33.185 --> 00:07:37.026]  On the internet, it is sacrowedgie.com.
[00:07:37.506 --> 00:07:42.407]  S-A-C-R-O-W-E-D-G-Y dot com.
[00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:46.008]  sacrowedgie.com Or you can use the toll free number.
[00:07:46.028 --> 00:07:46.088]  1-800-737-
[00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:50.070]  Big Brother.
[00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:51.791]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:11.312 --> 00:08:14.855]  All right, we are now 30 seconds into this second segment.
[00:08:14.895 --> 00:08:19.999]  During the short break we just had, I got a call from my producer here in the studio.
[00:08:41.590 --> 00:08:46.893]  They passed it a few months ago, as you know, along with the National ID card and a lot of other horrible things.
[00:08:46.913 --> 00:08:48.714]  But he's trying now to block funding for it.
[00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:15.387]  And so the congressman may at any time in the next two hours be calling in.
[00:09:15.487 --> 00:09:22.571]  So if he does call into the board, I will instantly hang up on whatever caller or even guest I have.
[00:09:22.611 --> 00:09:26.834]  I'll put that guest on hold and go to the congressman.
[00:09:27.857 --> 00:09:32.498]  Ron Paul always goes to the head of the line on this broadcast.
[00:09:32.878 --> 00:09:34.138]  You talk about access.
[00:09:34.738 --> 00:09:36.419]  You talk about involvement.
[00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:37.779]  You talk about caring.
[00:09:38.219 --> 00:09:39.379]  You talk about fighting.
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:41.860]  Ron Paul cannot be praised enough.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:52.742]  He introduces bills every year to abolish the Federal Reserve, to get out of the United Nations, to control our borders, to return the Second Amendment to full force.
[00:09:54.003 --> 00:09:56.063]  He's absolutely a godsend.
[00:09:56.864 --> 00:10:05.407]  And other congressmen are arrogant pumps, but Ron Paul's office is just so amazing.
[00:10:05.687 --> 00:10:18.932]  I mean, believe me, having congressmen's offices call you up, wanting to come on the show if he gets a chance to fight legislation, it just shows the commitment of Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:10:19.012 --> 00:10:22.613]  All right, enough of the love fest, but he deserves it.
[00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:27.332]  And you are great folks.
[00:10:27.412 --> 00:10:28.292]  You deserve credit.
[00:10:28.732 --> 00:10:42.575]  Because whether it's Greg Palast of the BBC, or big book publishers, or Ron Paul's office, they all know this broadcast gets a big response because of you.
[00:10:43.415 --> 00:10:44.555]  You're not on the fence.
[00:10:44.976 --> 00:10:46.156]  You're not in the bleachers.
[00:10:46.516 --> 00:10:47.636]  You're on the field.
[00:10:47.756 --> 00:10:48.516]  You're active.
[00:10:48.936 --> 00:10:50.317]  And I've got to salute the audience.
[00:10:50.637 --> 00:10:51.217]  God bless you.
[00:10:52.521 --> 00:11:12.097]  All right, Bush is still babbling in some press conference with the puppet dictator of Iraq about how wonderful things are going, and anybody that doesn't want to be occupied or have their husbands put in camps as a terrorist, and we're going to win in Iraq, blah, blah, blah.
[00:11:13.278 --> 00:11:19.163]  We lost in Iraq when our government funded Saddam Hussein $30-plus billion to attack Iran.
[00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:27.514]  Our government and the American people lost in Iraq morally when we told him to go ahead and invade Kuwait five days before he did it.
[00:11:28.495 --> 00:11:33.897]  We lost in Iraq morally when we engaged in sanctions that killed a million and a half Iraqis.
[00:11:34.937 --> 00:11:36.618]  And now that number's gotten much larger.
[00:11:37.959 --> 00:11:41.740]  So we lost in Iraq a long time ago, folks.
[00:11:42.300 --> 00:11:47.883]  We lost in Iraq when we assassinated their elected leaders and put in dictators.
[00:11:50.422 --> 00:12:02.745]  And now they put the Ba'athist regime back into control with the Sunnis, who are the minority, and the Iraqis, the Shiites and others, are hopping mad about it.
[00:12:03.666 --> 00:12:05.026]  And what do you expect?
[00:12:05.106 --> 00:12:12.728]  So, by the way, just listening for ten minutes, driving to the studio before I got on air, I heard about three or four Bushisms.
[00:12:12.848 --> 00:12:18.250]  I mean, this guy cannot speak English at the level of a five-year-old.
[00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:19.550]  I mean, seriously.
[00:12:20.754 --> 00:12:25.178]  The only thing he's gotten down is the fake West Texas accent.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:39.232]  And I routinely see Bush slip out of his West Texas accent back into his blue blood, perfect English dialect.
[00:12:39.953 --> 00:12:45.458]  So there's a lot of acting going on, and President Bush, you're not a good actor, so stop it.
[00:12:46.522 --> 00:12:52.523]  Come on, go ahead and go into your English accent and show us who you really are and let's get down to the facts here.
[00:12:54.564 --> 00:13:02.245]  I mean, your daddy hadn't gotten rid of his Tory colloquialisms, so why should you?
[00:13:03.325 --> 00:13:05.346]  Why don't you pack up and get out of Texas?
[00:13:05.366 --> 00:13:11.367]  We don't like gun grabbers and open border promoters and people that have Bill Clinton as a brother.
[00:13:12.003 --> 00:13:15.885]  By the way, Bill Clinton vacations, I told you, every month now.
[00:13:16.566 --> 00:13:22.590]  He spends about a week out of every two months, but a couple days every month with the Bushes.
[00:13:23.370 --> 00:13:26.172]  Barbara calls him their son, surrogate member of the family.
[00:13:27.072 --> 00:13:30.134]  And then they've always been in business together ever since he became governor.
[00:13:31.475 --> 00:13:33.196]  Very lucrative business.
[00:13:33.216 --> 00:13:35.958]  $30 million a day of cocaine going into MENA.
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.641]  And they are family, folks.
[00:13:38.661 --> 00:13:42.182]  They were family before the 2002 election.
[00:13:42.202 --> 00:13:44.462]  Excuse me.
[00:13:44.482 --> 00:13:45.523]  1992-93 election.
[00:13:46.303 --> 00:13:49.924]  They met 11 times in the year before the election at the little retreats.
[00:13:50.564 --> 00:13:52.025]  Sometimes for an entire week.
[00:13:52.505 --> 00:13:56.206]  I've been talking about this for years, but now they're just flaunting it.
[00:13:56.226 --> 00:14:02.368]  And as soon as Bill Clinton left office, a bunch of the neocon websites and
[00:14:03.081 --> 00:14:08.262]  Neocon talk show host hadn't gotten the memo, and they were like, now he's out of office!
[00:14:08.842 --> 00:14:15.063]  Let's have criminal investigations of pardoning cocaine dealers and having communist generals in the White House and selling out secrets to them!
[00:14:16.203 --> 00:14:17.964]  And let's investigate the cocaine!
[00:14:18.844 --> 00:14:23.865]  And boy, Bush came out and he said, you drop it right now, Congressman Burton!
[00:14:24.405 --> 00:14:29.125]  You leave Bill Clinton alone, I'm signing an order, making all his documents secret!
[00:14:29.926 --> 00:14:30.566]  You got it?
[00:14:31.386 --> 00:14:31.966]  Good!
[00:14:33.598 --> 00:14:38.802]  Then we've got to hear about how Hillary's going to get us in 08 if we don't vote for a Republican.
[00:14:39.143 --> 00:14:45.348]  It doesn't matter if it's Hillary Clinton or Al Gore or the governor of Virginia.
[00:14:45.408 --> 00:14:50.853]  It doesn't matter who your president is in 08 or Schwarzenegger or any of these people.
[00:14:51.293 --> 00:14:52.874]  You're going to get a globalist in there.
[00:14:53.355 --> 00:14:59.360]  You better start fighting at the county and city level because they're putting their own governments in, putting in their own electronic voting machines.
[00:15:00.521 --> 00:15:00.881]  Look, look.
[00:15:01.747 --> 00:15:17.694]  Are you noticing that since they put in these electronic, federally paid-for machines, three of the big companies putting them in, the lion's share of them, 35% of the companies now got them, and that number's growing, that suddenly, you know, in the past, if 90-plus percent of you were against toll roads, they wouldn't do it.
[00:15:18.255 --> 00:15:23.277]  Or if 90-plus percent of you were against grabbing a neighborhood and bulldozing it, it wouldn't happen.
[00:15:24.518 --> 00:15:27.639]  Or if 80-plus percent were against open borders, they wouldn't do it.
[00:15:28.613 --> 00:15:31.296]  Or if everybody was against a gun control measure, they wouldn't do it.
[00:15:31.316 --> 00:15:32.197]  Have you noticed now?
[00:15:33.478 --> 00:15:35.700]  And you can look geographically in all these areas.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:44.909]  As soon as these machines go in, they literally start tasering everybody, setting up checkpoints, passing all these laws, grabbing property, laughing at you.
[00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:47.432]  There's a reason, folks.
[00:15:49.314 --> 00:15:52.177]  Lou Dobbs, last night, had a poll...
[00:15:53.277 --> 00:15:54.418]  In fact, let me just get the poll.
[00:15:54.438 --> 00:15:56.599]  We've got a screenshot of it on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:15:56.919 --> 00:16:01.741]  Lou Dobbs CNN poll shows 99% against Supreme Court decision.
[00:16:02.841 --> 00:16:06.743]  And just tens of thousands of votes against it.
[00:16:06.763 --> 00:16:09.104]  The print is so small in this screenshot.
[00:16:09.584 --> 00:16:10.785]  I can read it on my computer.
[00:16:10.845 --> 00:16:11.906]  I can't on this printout.
[00:16:13.386 --> 00:16:15.007]  That's several thousand votes.
[00:16:15.327 --> 00:16:15.707]  Looks like 8,000.
[00:16:15.787 --> 00:16:17.348]  I'm trying to read it.
[00:16:17.668 --> 00:16:20.349]  And I can read the yes votes for grabbing property. 41%.
[00:16:23.382 --> 00:16:29.065]  I've got to change my rule of not having a computer in the studio, but see, I'd be typing this in right now and wouldn't be focused getting it.
[00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:30.846]  Do me a favor, Scott.
[00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:35.028]  Go to Prison Planet and look at this number so I get the poll right.
[00:16:35.608 --> 00:16:40.111]  I know it says 41 voted for land grabbing, and I know it's several thousand.
[00:16:40.151 --> 00:16:41.631]  I just can't exactly read that.
[00:16:42.392 --> 00:16:44.973]  Even though I've got 2015 vision, it's just too small.
[00:16:45.373 --> 00:16:46.534]  The screenshot's too small.
[00:16:46.994 --> 00:16:50.556]  In fact, tell Watson to get a bigger screenshot, please.
[00:16:52.415 --> 00:16:53.616]  Expand the screenshot.
[00:16:53.656 --> 00:16:54.817]  I don't think anybody could read this.
[00:16:54.857 --> 00:16:56.158]  I could barely read it on the computer.
[00:16:56.398 --> 00:16:57.399]  You probably won't be able to.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:00.721]  And we should write a little blurb about this.
[00:17:01.001 --> 00:17:04.284]  Doing a little bit of directing on air.
[00:17:04.344 --> 00:17:05.184]  That's how busy I am.
[00:17:05.204 --> 00:17:07.786]  I have to direct everybody while I'm on the air.
[00:17:07.806 --> 00:17:11.649]  I'm doing so many interviews and so much other stuff.
[00:17:11.929 --> 00:17:12.970]  So forgive me in that.
[00:17:13.951 --> 00:17:14.431]  But again, 90...
[00:17:17.995 --> 00:17:19.296]  9% against it.
[00:17:19.457 --> 00:17:21.939]  It's like Houston, 98% against the toll roads.
[00:17:22.059 --> 00:17:25.882]  Austin, 92% against the toll roads.
[00:17:26.422 --> 00:17:28.244]  And they just say, hey, sorry.
[00:17:29.224 --> 00:17:35.930]  Now, we did knock out the transponders that would be in all the cars and the inspection stickers starting in six months.
[00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:42.735]  We did narrowly defeat it, but now we're hearing there's going to be another emergency session, another special session, and
[00:17:43.567 --> 00:17:47.410]  They'll be fighting it all over again, but that's what a fight is all about.
[00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:50.352]  It's eternal against these scallywags.
[00:17:52.233 --> 00:17:53.974]  But I wrote this little article.
[00:17:53.994 --> 00:17:58.758]  I could have written a better article, but I wrote this in about five minutes this morning.
[00:17:58.818 --> 00:18:00.379]  But I think it's an important article.
[00:18:00.959 --> 00:18:04.502]  This is my comment we're posting along with the articles about the Supreme Court ruling.
[00:18:05.623 --> 00:18:05.743]  And...
[00:18:06.807 --> 00:18:14.354]  Supreme Court rules you don't own your property and gives free reign to robber barons, land barons, their agents and banks.
[00:18:15.635 --> 00:18:17.997]  Private property rights are the foundation of freedom.
[00:18:18.577 --> 00:18:25.604]  Now developers can pay off your local politicians and then come in and steal your property without even giving you best use price.
[00:18:26.444 --> 00:18:30.248]  Imagine, again, the very city that steals your property will tell you how much you get.
[00:18:30.268 --> 00:18:32.830]  And on average they give you about half value.
[00:18:33.516 --> 00:18:41.900]  Imagine middle-class neighborhoods across America being bulldozed because developers have written up a proposal for making more money off your property.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.161]  Either it's your property or it isn't.
[00:18:44.681 --> 00:18:47.423]  The United States is simply going back to feudalism.
[00:18:47.963 --> 00:18:56.487]  In medieval England, before the Magna Carta in 1214, the local lord would decide what you could and couldn't do with the king's property.
[00:18:57.361 --> 00:19:01.123]  The ruling overturns 800 years of common law and common sense.
[00:19:01.783 --> 00:19:03.224]  It butchers the Bill of Rights.
[00:19:03.264 --> 00:19:06.185]  The rest of the Bill of Rights isn't doing too well either.
[00:19:06.965 --> 00:19:10.827]  To put it frankly, it's gone.
[00:19:11.467 --> 00:19:20.351]  So many Americans are asking why the justices would make such a decision, overtly 180 degrees away from freedom.
[00:19:20.832 --> 00:19:21.552]  That's the point.
[00:19:22.222 --> 00:19:23.303]  It's in your face.
[00:19:23.943 --> 00:19:26.684]  The big police state dog is off the porch.
[00:19:27.364 --> 00:19:28.545]  I stole that from my dad.
[00:19:28.585 --> 00:19:33.107]  I had dinner with my parents last night, and he said, yeah, the big dog's off the porch, and he's saying, what you gonna do?
[00:19:33.527 --> 00:19:38.389]  The big police state dog is off the porch, and they think there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:42.251]  The all-powerful imperial state has thrown down the gauntlet.
[00:19:42.811 --> 00:19:46.913]  They have slapped the American people upside the head and brutally raped us.
[00:19:47.694 --> 00:19:50.395]  We'll finish this article when we get back.
[00:19:51.693 --> 00:20:01.481]  And we will cover a bunch of other news and take your calls today and look for Ron Paul to pop in sometime as well.
[00:20:01.541 --> 00:20:02.742]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:06.344]  Hi, folks.
[00:20:06.384 --> 00:20:08.166]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:20:08.446 --> 00:20:09.447]  The real money, folks.
[00:20:12.737 --> 00:20:14.418]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:20:14.438 --> 00:20:15.499]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:15.539 --> 00:20:16.560]  The dollars range from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:17.100]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.562]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:20:19.582 --> 00:20:21.463]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:20:21.483 --> 00:20:22.944]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[00:20:22.964 --> 00:20:24.425]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:20:40.237 --> 00:20:41.537]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:04.514 --> 00:21:07.395]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:21:07.735 --> 00:21:10.615]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?

[00:21:57.768 --> 00:22:00.350]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[00:22:00.370 --> 00:22:07.174]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:32.828]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[00:22:55.996 --> 00:22:56.617]  Call now.

[00:23:07.625 --> 00:23:08.506]  Look no further.

[00:23:38.581 --> 00:23:39.182]  We're good to go.
[00:24:06.259 --> 00:24:12.283]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:12.903 --> 00:24:15.885]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:23.430 --> 00:24:28.153]  Alright, genuine with this little article I wrote about the land grabbing, Supreme Court ruling.
[00:24:29.562 --> 00:24:34.324]  The big police state dog is off the porch and they think there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:24:34.764 --> 00:24:37.425]  The old powerful imperial state has thrown down the gauntlet.
[00:24:37.825 --> 00:24:44.448]  They have slapped the American people upside the head and brutally raped us and we have put up with it.
[00:24:45.128 --> 00:24:50.570]  So now they're placing what is left of American freedom on a spit so they can roast and eat us.
[00:24:52.054 --> 00:25:00.863]  The Founding Fathers said over and over again that the level of tyranny that we will live under is the exact amount that we will put up with and that we will accept.
[00:25:01.904 --> 00:25:05.167]  A group of hardcore criminals has gained control of our society.
[00:25:06.388 --> 00:25:10.392]  They could care less about the future of this country or the general public's welfare.
[00:25:11.095 --> 00:25:18.519]  What we are witnessing is a mad gold rush of corrupt politicians and corporations strip-mining Western society.
[00:25:18.979 --> 00:25:26.643]  We are being looted and sacked like ancient Rome by a herd of bloodthirsty barbarians.
[00:25:29.764 --> 00:25:31.585]  And here I am editing my article on air.
[00:25:31.625 --> 00:25:35.827]  That needs to be a horde of bloodthirsty barbarians.
[00:25:36.696 --> 00:25:50.083]  The only difference is the barbarians of today have high-tech public relations firms and cable news channels launching their psychological warfare barrages on a daily basis.
[00:25:50.324 --> 00:25:50.864]  Lay down.
[00:25:50.984 --> 00:25:51.504]  Lay down.
[00:25:51.924 --> 00:25:52.665]  Don't resist.
[00:25:52.765 --> 00:25:53.886]  Government loves you.
[00:25:54.266 --> 00:25:55.827]  Give up liberty for security.
[00:25:56.267 --> 00:25:58.928]  Tasering 82-year-old Alzheimer patients is good.
[00:25:59.349 --> 00:26:01.070]  Mercury and vaccines is nutritious.
[00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:02.790]  Open borders mean safety.
[00:26:03.091 --> 00:26:03.911]  Submit to us.
[00:26:03.951 --> 00:26:04.551]  Trust us.
[00:26:04.631 --> 00:26:05.412]  We don't lie.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:11.602]  The fact is, just because the Supreme Court says we don't have any property rights, doesn't mean it's true.
[00:26:12.803 --> 00:26:18.305]  A previous Supreme Court ruled that black Americans were not human beings, and thus had no rights.
[00:26:18.765 --> 00:26:20.906]  Would you follow a similar decree today?
[00:26:20.926 --> 00:26:23.988]  Despots know the power of setting precedents.
[00:26:24.588 --> 00:26:28.109]  That's why they've been bragging about their unprecedented ruling.
[00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:33.092]  I, for one, am glad that the mask is being...
[00:26:34.719 --> 00:26:41.104]  They've been land grabbing for a long time.
[00:26:41.605 --> 00:26:44.207]  Now it's just going to be more overt.
[00:26:44.808 --> 00:26:48.270]  So let it come and let everybody know what you are.
[00:26:48.911 --> 00:27:01.882]  A pack of wolves, a pack of criminals, a pack of liars, a pack of scum, a pack of parasites, a pack of trash, a pack of con men, a pack of murderers that are going down.
[00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:07.592]  And I know a lot of people are angry about this.
[00:27:07.632 --> 00:27:10.414]  Folks, they've been stealing people's property for a long time.
[00:27:10.494 --> 00:27:19.581]  I mean, the major phony environmental groups and the major federal agencies, the Forest Service and others.
[00:27:20.439 --> 00:27:25.101]  I've been caught in areas where certain types of woodpeckers have never been.
[00:27:25.121 --> 00:27:31.843]  They'll release two woodpeckers, photograph them as they release them, and then use that to take your property rights.
[00:27:31.883 --> 00:27:36.005]  Then they'll force you to sell because you can't use your property for pennies on the dollar.
[00:27:36.425 --> 00:27:38.306]  Then there'll be a shopping mall or whatever put there.
[00:27:38.526 --> 00:27:40.126]  Literally, it's just big business.
[00:27:41.007 --> 00:27:41.387]  All right?
[00:27:41.407 --> 00:27:42.947]  Then they get caught.
[00:27:42.967 --> 00:27:44.648]  They've been caught literally hundreds of times.
[00:27:44.668 --> 00:27:45.108]  Nothing happens.
[00:27:45.388 --> 00:27:47.149]  They'll go to an area and release a cougar.
[00:27:48.166 --> 00:27:53.814]  And the cougar's not even endangered, but they'll say, well, it's endangered regionally, whatever that means.
[00:27:54.034 --> 00:28:02.226]  Or they've been caught claiming that a salamander is a new species that they found and so you can't build on this area.
[00:28:03.419 --> 00:28:16.125]  But then they find out that it really is the same as a very common type of salamander that's even used for fish bait, though in a particular creek area, it is slightly different genetically.
[00:28:16.185 --> 00:28:20.747]  I mean, it can interbreed with the other salamanders, but it has five spots instead of four.
[00:28:21.568 --> 00:28:26.530]  This is like your cousins look a little different from you, but they're still your cousins.
[00:28:27.530 --> 00:28:28.631]  It's just out of control.
[00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:37.434]  And the cult-like environmental people on the ground will rob, steal, kill, whatever, to quote, save the earth.
[00:28:37.954 --> 00:28:49.780]  They never look at the fact that they're being funded by the big banks, being used to lay land off use, and then again come in and get control of it and then take the restrictions off.
[00:28:51.542 --> 00:28:53.383]  So this has been going on all over the place.
[00:28:53.423 --> 00:28:57.126]  I mean, you've got police without drugs even being found in your car or home.
[00:28:57.166 --> 00:28:59.788]  Well, you shouldn't have $5,000, Ms.
[00:28:59.848 --> 00:29:00.389]  Johnson.
[00:29:00.809 --> 00:29:02.610]  This happened in Texas just last year.
[00:29:02.650 --> 00:29:06.033]  There's hundreds of these cases, thousands of acid forfeiture seizures.
[00:29:06.053 --> 00:29:09.756]  But one old lady, 80-something years old, Mrs. Johnson, we interviewed her.
[00:29:10.176 --> 00:29:11.097]  No criminal record.
[00:29:11.137 --> 00:29:13.659]  She gets pulled over, got $5,000 in her purse.
[00:29:14.499 --> 00:29:16.421]  She was a rich, she just died.
[00:29:17.222 --> 00:29:19.483]  She was a rich oil baroness.
[00:29:20.204 --> 00:29:21.665]  And they said, why do you have all this money?
[00:29:21.685 --> 00:29:22.645]  Well, I don't trust banks.
[00:29:22.666 --> 00:29:23.766]  I always carry a little bit of cash.
[00:29:24.707 --> 00:29:26.308]  And the cops took her money.
[00:29:27.188 --> 00:29:28.169]  Of course, she sued them.
[00:29:28.809 --> 00:29:30.110]  Only reason you ever heard about it.
[00:29:30.771 --> 00:29:33.693]  Cost her about $20,000 to get her $5,000 back.
[00:29:34.553 --> 00:29:37.015]  Cops said, well, you shouldn't have this much money in your purse.
[00:29:38.696 --> 00:29:40.897]  $5,000 is not even that much money in today's inflation.
[00:29:41.497 --> 00:29:43.679]  They heard about the black guy flying to Houston to...
[00:29:44.361 --> 00:29:45.863]  To buy a bunch of shrubs.
[00:29:46.103 --> 00:29:47.345]  He pays with cash every year.
[00:29:47.365 --> 00:29:49.328]  They take every dime he's got.
[00:29:50.129 --> 00:29:51.190]  What was it, $45,000?
[00:29:54.194 --> 00:29:55.095]  We're on the march.
[00:29:55.576 --> 00:29:57.178]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:57.198 --> 00:30:00.802]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.679 --> 00:30:05.119]  We're good to go.
[00:30:27.654 --> 00:30:30.496]  And your cholesterol level's on its own without prescription drugs.
[00:30:30.636 --> 00:30:31.836]  And you'll have more energy.
[00:30:31.937 --> 00:30:36.699]  What's more, your body can clean and clear your arteries on its own as long as it has the proper nutrients.
[00:30:36.959 --> 00:30:39.961]  Everybody understands the importance of keeping their arteries clear.
[00:30:40.041 --> 00:30:44.504]  But did you know that in 25% of the cases, the first symptom of blocked arteries is...
[00:30:44.824 --> 00:30:45.205]  Death?
[00:30:45.345 --> 00:30:47.147]  Don't take unnecessary risks.
[00:30:47.387 --> 00:30:51.031]  Keep your arteries healthy and clear by taking Heart and Body Extract.
[00:30:51.071 --> 00:30:54.375]  To get Heart and Body Extract, go to heartandbodyextract.com or call 1-866-295-5305.
[00:30:54.395 --> 00:30:54.896]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:30:54.916 --> 00:30:55.416]  Call now.
[00:31:03.576 --> 00:31:11.843]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:12.084 --> 00:31:16.447]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:16.748 --> 00:31:25.656]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:25.876 --> 00:31:29.479]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:29.759 --> 00:31:34.802]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:35.103 --> 00:31:41.847]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:42.307 --> 00:31:42.868]  What about you?
[00:31:43.539 --> 00:31:44.239]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[00:33:08.732 --> 00:33:10.634]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:11.094 --> 00:33:14.097]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:14.317 --> 00:33:22.525]  Alright, folks.
[00:33:24.226 --> 00:33:27.349]  Your calls are coming up here in a few minutes.
[00:33:30.131 --> 00:33:34.896]  And we'll, of course, obviously talk about the attacks on land rights.
[00:33:37.239 --> 00:33:40.822]  But in the meantime, I need to go over some more of this news.
[00:33:42.383 --> 00:33:56.973]  It is just of the utmost importance that we realize as a society that across the board, the government is dismantling our freedoms, is dismantling our liberties.
[00:33:57.910 --> 00:34:01.711]  I mean, are they going to claim now that taking our private property is to stop terrorism?
[00:34:02.311 --> 00:34:06.813]  You know, the national ID cards and all the rest of it is to stop terrorism, they say.
[00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:07.433]  Of course it isn't.
[00:34:07.473 --> 00:34:08.333]  The border's wide open.
[00:34:08.994 --> 00:34:10.574]  The gun control's to keep us safe.
[00:34:10.654 --> 00:34:20.197]  Why, in Richmond, Virginia, they want to declare martial law because there's been too many shootings this year, even though the shooting numbers are way down from last year.
[00:34:23.478 --> 00:34:25.479]  I'll tell you what, we'll just go ahead and go to calls now.
[00:34:26.818 --> 00:34:29.100]  And then we will get back into the news.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.863]  There's just so much of it here, but I'm sure the callers want to respond.
[00:34:33.143 --> 00:34:34.605]  Who's up first here, Scott?
[00:34:36.206 --> 00:34:37.047]  David Mass.
[00:34:37.067 --> 00:34:37.987]  David, you're on the air.
[00:34:38.027 --> 00:34:38.448]  Go ahead.
[00:34:39.429 --> 00:34:40.269]  How are you today, Alex?
[00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.890]  Good, David.
[00:34:42.451 --> 00:34:49.217]  When I got up this morning, my wife likes to turn on the local station, and the story came up.
[00:34:50.512 --> 00:34:58.079]  That two planes almost collided at Boston's Logan Airport a couple of weeks ago, but they're just informing us now.
[00:34:58.319 --> 00:35:02.663]  Well, yeah, it says that they always keep things like this quiet.
[00:35:03.184 --> 00:35:04.805]  Yes, but here's the interesting thing.
[00:35:04.825 --> 00:35:12.993]  So I go to the Associated Press today and get the article, Air Traffic Controllers Covered Up Errors at Dallas-Fort Worth.
[00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:14.374]  The same thing happened.
[00:35:14.694 --> 00:35:16.336]  That's the article I've got, yeah.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.102]  Yeah, that's probably the one that you've seen.
[00:35:20.342 --> 00:35:24.844]  So what kind of potential control are they going to try to spring on us next?
[00:35:24.904 --> 00:35:29.926]  So maybe consolidate the airline so there'll be one national airline like Israel, maybe.
[00:35:31.407 --> 00:35:32.947]  Well, it's all about freedom, sir.
[00:35:33.027 --> 00:35:35.128]  Just give up all your freedoms and you'll be free.
[00:35:35.749 --> 00:35:36.269]  That's right.
[00:35:36.289 --> 00:35:37.309]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:35:37.349 --> 00:35:39.130]  What do you think about the Supreme Court ruling?
[00:35:40.831 --> 00:35:42.852]  I was incensed when I saw that.
[00:35:43.755 --> 00:35:44.095]  Totally.
[00:35:44.296 --> 00:35:46.077]  Well, again, they can announce this power.
[00:35:46.117 --> 00:35:47.719]  It doesn't mean we have to go along with it.
[00:35:47.739 --> 00:35:53.243]  And a lot of the families in these homes, a lot of these families are saying they're not going to put up with it.
[00:35:54.384 --> 00:35:57.307]  And I applaud that, and I'll do the same.
[00:35:57.347 --> 00:36:01.851]  Now, the way this thing gets back to the airport thing, I thought this was kind of an interesting connection.
[00:36:03.252 --> 00:36:04.413]  About a week and a half ago, U.S.
[00:36:05.454 --> 00:36:07.796]  to scale back passport standards.
[00:36:07.836 --> 00:36:09.358]  Now, let me just read a couple of little quick things.
[00:36:09.398 --> 00:36:10.579]  I don't want to monopolize time.
[00:36:11.562 --> 00:36:12.222]  From this article.
[00:36:12.602 --> 00:36:23.767]  The official who spoke on condition of anonymity because the standards had not been announced said, Homeland Security plans to require expanded biometric data in passports in the future.
[00:36:24.267 --> 00:36:29.810]  And then Chertoff, in the same article, says, actually, he says...
[00:36:31.431 --> 00:36:44.437]  Visiting Brussels last month, Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff reaffirmed the United States' commitment to biometrics as a high-tech approach to security screening compatible on both sides of the Atlantic.
[00:36:44.657 --> 00:36:45.777]  Yeah, it's a global idea.
[00:36:45.817 --> 00:36:46.558]  Thanks for the call.
[00:36:47.678 --> 00:36:56.222]  They told us a year ago what they're going to do with the passports, and I love it in new articles because they know how unpopular it is, and I've seen similar stories.
[00:36:56.642 --> 00:36:58.383]  Oh, we can't tell you the details.
[00:36:59.614 --> 00:37:00.775]  Well, we have the details.
[00:37:01.576 --> 00:37:10.946]  It's biometrics, a chip in the passport, RFID, a digital face scan photo, and a thumb or index finger imprint.
[00:37:11.847 --> 00:37:15.011]  That's why everybody should renew their passports now.
[00:37:16.392 --> 00:37:21.578]  And already, almost every state in the union takes a digital photo for a face scan imprint.
[00:37:22.894 --> 00:37:27.976]  For the digital map of the face and the identifiers and a thumbprint or index print.
[00:37:27.996 --> 00:37:33.998]  They've been doing it in Texas since 1993, and people are in such denial about it.
[00:37:34.038 --> 00:37:38.460]  I have people walk up to me a couple times a year going, Alex, I didn't thumbprint to get a license.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:41.301]  And I go, you don't remember that little black box with the red light?
[00:37:41.501 --> 00:37:42.601]  Oh, yeah, I do.
[00:37:43.401 --> 00:37:45.062]  Well, you gave a thumbprint.
[00:37:46.648 --> 00:38:01.860]  And every day, there's more articles today about shops and stores and tanning salons and gyms and businesses and Disney World and Disneyland and Sea World and all these other places.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:06.224]  I mean, every day, there's an article where whole chains are putting these in.
[00:38:06.244 --> 00:38:15.551]  And they go, oh, you get a big 5%, 4%, or 10% discount if you enroll with us in thumbprint.
[00:38:17.481 --> 00:38:17.881]  We're good to go.
[00:38:41.102 --> 00:38:43.465]  When you're paying, you'll get the discount.
[00:38:43.886 --> 00:38:47.571]  But they're starting the discount small, and now talking about making them even bigger.
[00:38:48.432 --> 00:38:49.793]  And imagine the penalty.
[00:38:49.954 --> 00:38:51.075]  Oh, you don't want a thumbprint.
[00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:54.720]  Well, then your groceries... This is why I go to Randall's.
[00:38:55.655 --> 00:39:03.837]  I don't like going to HEB because they're trying to put thumb scanners in, but now I'm lifting my boycott of HEB because it's just as bad as at Randall's.
[00:39:03.857 --> 00:39:09.459]  And they'll go, well, you would have saved $22 on this $100 purchase, Mr. Jones.
[00:39:09.539 --> 00:39:13.340]  Look what you would have saved with a Randall's card.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.801]  And I'm like, yeah, well, pretty soon it'll be a National ID card.
[00:39:16.841 --> 00:39:20.662]  I have to swipe anyways, and then there won't be any discount, lady.
[00:39:21.042 --> 00:39:21.902]  You know what you're doing.
[00:39:23.248 --> 00:39:27.130]  And then HEB, of course, the good news is they put in all these self-checkout lanes.
[00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:32.693]  And again, I was there on the night before Father's Day buying food for a brunch we were going to have at my house.
[00:39:33.193 --> 00:39:34.434]  The place was jam-packed.
[00:39:34.494 --> 00:39:39.877]  I guess everybody had the same idea to go out and, you know, people forgot stuff for Father's Day.
[00:39:41.017 --> 00:39:43.939]  And I'm in there at midnight, and the place is a madhouse.
[00:39:44.819 --> 00:39:47.821]  I mean, giant lines, people everywhere at midnight.
[00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:51.972]  Only time I've got time to go to the grocery store.
[00:39:52.812 --> 00:39:59.797]  And there's two lanes open for service checkout, you know, with human beings, baggers and checkers.
[00:40:00.938 --> 00:40:05.561]  And there literally had to be like ten self-checkout lanes, you know, two deep.
[00:40:06.202 --> 00:40:06.862]  No one!
[00:40:07.323 --> 00:40:08.784]  And I wish for a video camera.
[00:40:08.804 --> 00:40:09.884]  I'm going to go in there at night.
[00:40:09.905 --> 00:40:11.085]  I'm going to go in Home Depot, too.
[00:40:11.366 --> 00:40:12.727]  They'll see it at Home Depot at night.
[00:40:13.127 --> 00:40:14.668]  At Home Depot, they don't give you a choice.
[00:40:15.088 --> 00:40:16.029]  You have got
[00:40:16.795 --> 00:40:18.036]  To use the self-checkout.
[00:40:18.556 --> 00:40:32.667]  And I was about, one night at about 11 o'clock, to demand at the Home Depot, trying to talk too fast, at the Home Depot by my house, I was about to demand a manager in service, and other people in front of me were doing it.
[00:40:32.687 --> 00:40:33.928]  Hey, I want service!
[00:40:34.789 --> 00:40:36.170]  I don't want to use this!
[00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:37.191]  I don't like these!
[00:40:39.002 --> 00:40:48.568]  And so they said, okay, we understand, and called the manager up there with a huge line that had been formed with people buying light bulbs and water hoses.
[00:40:48.648 --> 00:40:49.769]  I was buying light bulbs.
[00:40:51.249 --> 00:40:53.371]  So people aren't using it.
[00:40:53.411 --> 00:41:03.677]  In fact, I was told by an HEB manager that they actually pulled some of the self-checkout lanes out in stores in San Antonio because people totally refused to use them.
[00:41:05.831 --> 00:41:11.756]  So again, if we just say no to the self-checkout, by the way, it doesn't save you money.
[00:41:13.037 --> 00:41:20.002]  I've read industry reports from the 60s where McDonald's was the first to put the thank you on the trash can.
[00:41:22.052 --> 00:41:27.213]  And people would feel like they were supposed to go do it.
[00:41:27.473 --> 00:41:29.054]  But at first, people wouldn't do that.
[00:41:29.134 --> 00:41:37.895]  So they would have employees go and say, you know, if you'd like to, you can throw this away and it will save you money on the price of your burgers.
[00:41:38.616 --> 00:41:41.896]  And so people said, oh, well let me do it then.
[00:41:42.676 --> 00:41:43.837]  And they went and they did it.
[00:41:43.897 --> 00:41:44.897]  And then soon it's...
[00:41:45.583 --> 00:41:54.391]  I mean, I've been with friends and family, and when I'm at Wendy's or something, when I go there, I mean, literally, maybe three times a year now, if I'm starving to death and got low blood sugar, I might go.
[00:41:54.711 --> 00:41:57.593]  I hardly eat fast food, but I'll be with family at a Wendy's.
[00:41:57.653 --> 00:41:58.674]  I won't go to McDonald's.
[00:41:59.555 --> 00:42:02.217]  Wendy's at least has got, you know, the salads and baked potatoes.
[00:42:03.178 --> 00:42:04.800]  And they'll go, why aren't you throwing that away?
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.561]  Alex, that's rude.
[00:42:06.581 --> 00:42:07.902]  And I'm like, what are you talking about?
[00:42:09.564 --> 00:42:11.705]  We get the level of service we demand.
[00:42:11.745 --> 00:42:13.307]  This doesn't save us any money.
[00:42:14.534 --> 00:42:22.500]  No, it just means the floors are dirty and nobody's in here wiping the tables down and we throw the food away.
[00:42:24.262 --> 00:42:26.203]  It's the same thing with back in the 60s.
[00:42:26.263 --> 00:42:28.325]  They started putting in self-serve.
[00:42:28.505 --> 00:42:31.728]  Oh, you get a few cents discount if you self-serve.
[00:42:32.468 --> 00:42:35.671]  And then now you forget to check your tires and have more blowouts.
[00:42:35.691 --> 00:42:36.612]  Statistics show it.
[00:42:37.733 --> 00:42:39.254]  You forget to check your water.
[00:42:39.314 --> 00:42:41.295]  You forget to check your radiator.
[00:42:41.335 --> 00:42:43.037]  You forget to check your washer fluid.
[00:42:44.485 --> 00:42:45.505]  Remember the good old days?
[00:42:45.525 --> 00:42:46.366]  I remember being a kid.
[00:42:46.386 --> 00:42:47.366]  You know, my mom would pull in.
[00:42:47.426 --> 00:42:49.027]  Nice teenager would come out.
[00:42:49.047 --> 00:42:49.627]  How you doing?
[00:42:49.647 --> 00:42:50.208]  Check everything.
[00:42:50.228 --> 00:42:50.928]  Hey, this is low.
[00:42:50.968 --> 00:42:51.928]  I'm going to fill it.
[00:42:52.249 --> 00:42:53.709]  You know, squeegee the windows.
[00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:56.851]  Ah, but for two cent discount.
[00:42:57.651 --> 00:42:58.251]  A gallon.
[00:42:58.331 --> 00:42:58.852]  No.
[00:42:58.952 --> 00:43:00.552]  Let's gas it ourselves.
[00:43:02.013 --> 00:43:03.414]  Let's gas it.
[00:43:03.454 --> 00:43:06.555]  See, but forget all that.
[00:43:06.595 --> 00:43:10.397]  That's just a corporate scam to eliminate service.
[00:43:10.917 --> 00:43:12.718]  You know, we get in society what we want.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:18.427]  No, now it's, you see, the military's going all robotic, all drone.
[00:43:18.888 --> 00:43:20.129]  There's articles on it today.
[00:43:20.450 --> 00:43:22.994]  That then gives central groups total control.
[00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:33.952]  When you go to thumb scanning and self-checkout, when Kmart was imploding a couple years ago, right here in Austin, they just removed all the checkers.
[00:43:33.992 --> 00:43:48.755]  They'd have a security guard and a manager, and they were telling people, well, just to make sure, when you're using a credit card, we put thumb scanners in, and we want you to thumb scan when you're up here at the counter, when you're using your credit card.
[00:43:49.716 --> 00:43:51.276]  Again, just training you.
[00:43:53.684 --> 00:43:55.224]  And again, I see adults.
[00:43:55.324 --> 00:43:56.525]  I saw this on Monday.
[00:43:57.525 --> 00:44:06.227]  I'm in a convenience store, and a guy who looked like, I don't know, 35 years old walks up, buys some gas, buys some other stuff, says, oh, I want one of those lighters.
[00:44:08.067 --> 00:44:10.788]  And of course, they're behind the counter like we're all children.
[00:44:11.308 --> 00:44:12.448]  We've all got to be watched out for.
[00:44:12.468 --> 00:44:14.188]  And she goes, I need to see your license, please.
[00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:15.769]  He said, is there a law?
[00:44:15.809 --> 00:44:17.189]  She says, nope, it's policy.
[00:44:18.129 --> 00:44:21.390]  And Diamond Shamrock, manager, he since quit,
[00:44:22.119 --> 00:44:29.063]  Diamond Shamrock manager told me, he said, I saw him carding literally an old lady, folks.
[00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:31.684]  She had to be 75 years old for some six-pack of beer.
[00:44:32.505 --> 00:44:33.765]  And I said, what are you doing carding her?
[00:44:33.785 --> 00:44:35.646]  And he goes, we've been told to card everybody.
[00:44:36.167 --> 00:44:40.489]  And he goes, and soon we've been told we're going to be carding everybody for everything.
[00:44:41.089 --> 00:44:42.270]  And he said, come behind the counter.
[00:44:43.070 --> 00:44:44.071]  Soon as folks cleared out.
[00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:47.032]  And I went behind the counter, and he says, watch this.
[00:44:47.072 --> 00:44:48.693]  And he swiped his driver's license.
[00:44:49.234 --> 00:44:49.854]  And he said, look.
[00:44:50.533 --> 00:44:52.654]  I know there's warrants out for your arrest.
[00:44:53.495 --> 00:44:55.075]  This instantly goes into a database.
[00:44:56.236 --> 00:44:57.797]  Tagging where you're at, what you're doing.
[00:44:58.097 --> 00:44:59.838]  Why is that at Diamond Shamrock?
[00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:07.721]  I've been in Walgreens and seen them, you know, card 55-year-old men for cigars.
[00:45:09.202 --> 00:45:11.383]  Getting you... Okay, I'm ranting and raving here.
[00:45:11.403 --> 00:45:13.404]  It's just... Phillip in Texas.
[00:45:13.444 --> 00:45:14.164]  Phillip, go ahead.
[00:45:14.685 --> 00:45:15.505]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[00:45:15.745 --> 00:45:17.906]  I need to get one thing across here.
[00:45:17.926 --> 00:45:19.507]  You talked to a sovereign citizen.
[00:45:20.177 --> 00:45:24.561]  We have servants like Ron Paul working for us, so I hope he doesn't cut me off.
[00:45:25.422 --> 00:45:35.951]  We the people can control this eminent domain by taking it to a jury trial and saying, not guilty, you're not going to get what you want.
[00:45:36.371 --> 00:45:38.153]  If you don't understand how we the people...
[00:45:43.697 --> 00:45:45.858]  In these domain issues where you don't even get a jury.
[00:45:45.998 --> 00:45:52.601]  Ron Paul, or correction, Alex Jones, the special court that we the people have is an Article III court.
[00:45:52.761 --> 00:45:54.802]  Go to the original Constitution.
[00:45:55.422 --> 00:45:57.984]  No, I know these are fraudulent courts.
[00:45:58.004 --> 00:45:59.424]  Well, then don't go to them.
[00:45:59.464 --> 00:46:01.345]  Tell them that that's not my court.
[00:46:01.825 --> 00:46:04.887]  The trouble is that you're playing into their corporate game.
[00:46:05.167 --> 00:46:09.429]  The Supreme Court that you're talking about is for the District of Columbia.
[00:46:09.689 --> 00:46:12.550]  There is a Supreme Court of the States of the Union.
[00:46:13.050 --> 00:46:16.333]  If you're going to think on a lower level, you're in their game.
[00:46:16.454 --> 00:46:20.437]  If you're not a sovereign citizen, you are a U.S.C.
[00:46:20.497 --> 00:46:22.399]  citizen, you're in their court.
[00:46:22.459 --> 00:46:29.606]  Hey, Phillip, I'm going to put you on hold for a second because it sounds like we're not going to be able to go back and forth here without doing that.
[00:46:30.107 --> 00:46:31.448]  Phillip, I appreciate you.
[00:46:31.468 --> 00:46:33.370]  Number one, I'm not Ron Paul.
[00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:34.191]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:46:34.431 --> 00:46:36.373]  So let's get that straight, number one.
[00:46:38.067 --> 00:46:41.288]  Number two, I've been doing this for, I keep saying ten years.
[00:46:41.308 --> 00:46:42.828]  I've been saying ten years for two years.
[00:46:43.668 --> 00:46:44.068]  I don't know.
[00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:45.728]  I got involved in like 1994.
[00:46:47.589 --> 00:46:48.669]  So how long is that?
[00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:49.949]  That's 11 years.
[00:46:50.629 --> 00:46:52.290]  Got on TV in 95.
[00:46:52.770 --> 00:46:53.810]  Got on radio in 96.
[00:46:54.330 --> 00:46:56.530]  But I've been involved that long.
[00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.071]  And there's a lot of other people that have been involved a lot longer than I have.
[00:47:00.271 --> 00:47:04.792]  And these poor people do this debt elimination, and a lot of them lose their houses.
[00:47:04.832 --> 00:47:05.772]  They go to the Huskow.
[00:47:07.363 --> 00:47:20.833]  They are using real laws, real procedures, but the government has a pack of goons in black masks with machine guns that don't even know what the Bill of Rights is, much less what type of court you're talking about.
[00:47:23.075 --> 00:47:33.862]  And so many people, they go in with jurisdictional debates, they go in with different, I'm a sovereign individual, I'm not a person, and yes, they get you to plead into their jurisdiction.
[00:47:33.982 --> 00:47:34.743]  All that is true.
[00:47:35.447 --> 00:47:38.328]  And I've got federal and state rulings where they use admiralty.
[00:47:39.008 --> 00:47:49.389]  You know, one case of a lady who owned her own 80-something makers in Colorado, famous screenwriter, and they just wanted her property and they came and arrested her and took her before a court and said, this is admiralty.
[00:47:49.409 --> 00:47:51.010]  You're not even allowed to argue.
[00:47:52.450 --> 00:47:55.830]  So the problem is we're dealing with just pure despotism, sir.
[00:47:56.931 --> 00:48:04.612]  They created artificial courts and contract fraud as they were transferring us out of the Bill of Rights and Constitution and Common Law.
[00:48:05.712 --> 00:48:18.521]  And constitutional courts, then they started transferring us into Roman civil law, or in a more modern sense, Napoleonic, guilty until proven innocent law, just to have the illusion of it being above board.
[00:48:19.161 --> 00:48:21.023]  Now there's not even a pretense of that.
[00:48:21.123 --> 00:48:23.684]  Sir, take Judge Jean Muir.
[00:48:24.005 --> 00:48:26.186]  She's got these special courts they set up.
[00:48:27.187 --> 00:48:28.147]  You don't have juries.
[00:48:28.187 --> 00:48:29.548]  You can't face your accusers.
[00:48:29.949 --> 00:48:32.891]  She has a giant juvenile justice concentration camp.
[00:48:33.271 --> 00:48:34.772]  Her name is on the building.
[00:48:35.856 --> 00:48:47.724]  You know, when she got the funding passed and then pushed it through to build this giant compound to break up families and destroy society, they actually put her name on the building while she is a sitting judge.
[00:48:48.464 --> 00:48:49.585]  It's happening all over the country.
[00:48:50.406 --> 00:48:52.787]  And here's an example.
[00:48:53.228 --> 00:48:56.850]  The state law says truancy is X amount of days missed.
[00:48:57.891 --> 00:48:59.772]  It's over 10 days in a semester.
[00:49:00.467 --> 00:49:01.087]  They don't care.
[00:49:01.247 --> 00:49:05.929]  She says three tardies being late.
[00:49:06.430 --> 00:49:09.151]  You get like three or four minutes, five minutes to get to your classes.
[00:49:09.631 --> 00:49:10.632]  I was routinely tardy.
[00:49:11.372 --> 00:49:13.973]  Going to Anderson High, I had to run from one end of the school to the other.
[00:49:14.573 --> 00:49:18.215]  If I had to go to the bathroom, I had to do it extremely quickly.
[00:49:19.175 --> 00:49:24.698]  And God forbid I had to engage in the procedure that takes longer than 30 seconds, I would get tardy.
[00:49:25.138 --> 00:49:29.780]  Well, now three tardies in a semester is considered a truancy.
[00:49:30.862 --> 00:49:32.323]  And I have local newscasts.
[00:49:32.804 --> 00:49:35.085]  You are then criminally charged.
[00:49:35.506 --> 00:49:41.711]  But the statute says, to be accurate, 14 unexcused absences in a semester.
[00:49:42.031 --> 00:49:42.732]  That is criminal.
[00:49:43.492 --> 00:49:43.932]  Uh-uh.
[00:49:44.433 --> 00:49:45.394]  Three tardies.
[00:49:46.154 --> 00:49:47.335]  And it's not even a law.
[00:49:47.715 --> 00:49:49.837]  But she calls the families in, screams at them.
[00:49:50.197 --> 00:49:51.799]  She puts this on the news.
[00:49:52.359 --> 00:49:54.541]  Screams at them and says, Sign the document!
[00:49:55.365 --> 00:49:59.649]  And the father starts shaking and signs it, and then she goes, all right, your child is now on probation.
[00:49:59.909 --> 00:50:01.130]  I'm ordering drug testing.
[00:50:01.470 --> 00:50:02.471]  And then you're in the system.
[00:50:03.112 --> 00:50:06.535]  And they put it on the news, flaunting it like it's normal.
[00:50:06.995 --> 00:50:11.279]  Now, if you refuse to go to her court, she will just send goons to grab your children.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.962]  We have to expose that the whole thing is a fraud.
[00:50:15.503 --> 00:50:16.344]  Okay, go ahead, Phil.
[00:50:17.505 --> 00:50:18.345]  Oh, Philip hung up.
[00:50:18.425 --> 00:50:22.249]  Okay, well, I just didn't like the accusatory tone of all that.
[00:50:23.118 --> 00:50:36.186]  And, you know, being told how it works, and everybody's always got the magic silver bullet, and I explain to people that it isn't a magic silver bullet, announcing yourself as the sovereign and, you know, not pleading into the system.
[00:50:36.866 --> 00:50:38.347]  They'll still put you under the jail.
[00:50:40.349 --> 00:50:42.330]  Really what hurts them is exposure.
[00:50:43.330 --> 00:50:44.551]  You want to expose these people?
[00:50:44.991 --> 00:50:52.516]  Follow the judge, okay, when he goes to a gay bar, okay, and put that out on TV or on the web.
[00:50:53.346 --> 00:50:55.648]  Follow the judge when he goes to the topless bar.
[00:50:56.569 --> 00:50:58.471]  Follow the judge when he makes a drug buy.
[00:50:59.652 --> 00:51:00.813]  Play hardball.
[00:51:01.493 --> 00:51:02.374]  That's how we get them.
[00:51:05.689 --> 00:51:08.552]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:08.813 --> 00:51:10.374]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:10.735 --> 00:51:15.400]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.

[00:51:20.606 --> 00:51:24.771]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:24.991 --> 00:51:25.471]  We're good to go.
[00:51:55.151 --> 00:51:58.513]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:51:58.893 --> 00:52:03.136]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:53:47.935 --> 00:53:49.857]  We're good to go.
[00:54:18.207 --> 00:54:23.633]  We have two of the homeowners whose houses are going to be bulldozed.
[00:54:25.215 --> 00:54:28.720]  And the city is saying they will use police and force to remove people.
[00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:31.143]  Just wait until it happens.
[00:54:31.163 --> 00:54:33.085]  By the way, some cops live in that neighborhood.
[00:54:33.425 --> 00:54:34.427]  Some gods.
[00:54:35.188 --> 00:54:37.752]  Because, you know, they're officials.
[00:54:37.892 --> 00:54:38.853]  We're servants.
[00:54:38.994 --> 00:54:41.397]  We're served now, you know, in this tyranny.
[00:54:41.437 --> 00:54:42.619]  We're under the government.
[00:54:43.099 --> 00:54:44.822]  They're the officials, the authority.
[00:54:44.862 --> 00:54:47.886]  But there's quite a few cops living in this neighborhood.
[00:54:47.986 --> 00:54:51.131]  So I guess cops are going to get to kick cops out.
[00:54:52.244 --> 00:54:57.288]  Of course, the cops will probably just stoop and bow and lick boots, lick black boots.
[00:54:57.889 --> 00:54:59.130]  Oh, black mask.
[00:54:59.650 --> 00:55:01.351]  Anyone wearing a black mask is good.
[00:55:01.552 --> 00:55:03.113]  Don't send in a SWAT team on me.
[00:55:03.593 --> 00:55:08.277]  Here, bulldoze my 100-year-old house in this beautiful middle-class neighborhood.
[00:55:09.098 --> 00:55:15.303]  They're just going to destroy a massive area because they want to build some high-rise apartments.
[00:55:16.624 --> 00:55:19.026]  So anytime some developer wants your property...
[00:55:20.242 --> 00:55:24.625]  You know, developers wanted property in Austin to build a high-rise building.
[00:55:25.485 --> 00:55:33.590]  They couldn't get eminent domain to do it, so they had to pay some of the people that held out upwards of $800,000 for little bitty houses.
[00:55:34.731 --> 00:55:35.271]  And you know what?
[00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:37.773]  There's always a price high enough to do it.
[00:55:38.153 --> 00:55:43.976]  Or there have been cases in New York where a little church won't sell, so they build the building right over the church and have an agreement.
[00:55:44.036 --> 00:55:44.877]  It's a cool church.
[00:55:44.997 --> 00:55:46.438]  I went and visited it while I was in New York.
[00:55:48.021 --> 00:55:51.803]  Oh no, now we'll just... Again, this is what property is about.
[00:55:53.884 --> 00:55:58.466]  I heard a talk show host yesterday, I forget who, talking about, you two of you guessed right, you made a lot of money.
[00:55:58.946 --> 00:56:02.487]  You know, you go buy that piece of property 20 years before where they're going to build a highway.
[00:56:02.848 --> 00:56:06.029]  You went and read the highway plans that in 10, 20 years they plan to build one.
[00:56:06.349 --> 00:56:08.250]  You buy it right there at that four-way stop.
[00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:11.071]  Now, they don't want to pay you for it.
[00:56:11.111 --> 00:56:15.233]  They just say, oh, well, you're under eminent domain even within the old system.
[00:56:16.793 --> 00:56:19.215]  And so we're not going to pay you full price for that.
[00:56:19.255 --> 00:56:20.515]  It's going to go into some city court.
[00:56:20.535 --> 00:56:23.677]  We're going to give you what the tax rolls say it's worth.
[00:56:25.378 --> 00:56:28.060]  But I'm only going to get $200,000 for my acre?
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:33.703]  Well, but it says here I would have been paid about a million dollars for this.
[00:56:33.723 --> 00:56:34.623]  That would be the going rate.
[00:56:35.104 --> 00:56:37.045]  Now this highway is going to be built right beside it.
[00:56:37.545 --> 00:56:40.787]  Hey, just shut up or we'll send some guys by with machine guns, okay?
[00:56:43.949 --> 00:56:45.690]  I mean, that's what this tyranny is about, folks.
[00:56:47.245 --> 00:56:49.847]  But now, it is your existing homes.
[00:56:51.168 --> 00:56:53.009]  Not for highways, not for a hospital.
[00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:56.352]  We're talking whole neighborhoods in lucrative areas.
[00:56:58.433 --> 00:57:11.803]  And the harassment I've seen of old people, I mean, if there's some old sick person living in a beautiful house on the corner, say, of West 37th Street in Austin, the case of Roland Ellingston, they come and go, three-inch grass, $2,000 a day fines.
[00:57:12.043 --> 00:57:13.264]  They came and arrested him.
[00:57:14.324 --> 00:57:20.909]  And, of course, that was a big news story here in Austin because it came out later they wanted to build something on that property.
[00:57:20.949 --> 00:57:22.291]  They wanted to build a shop there.
[00:57:23.091 --> 00:57:25.753]  I mean, that property could have gone for a million smackers.
[00:57:26.994 --> 00:57:29.436]  Right there on Guadalupe Street, so expensive.
[00:57:29.456 --> 00:57:31.598]  I mean, real estate just astronomical.
[00:57:32.058 --> 00:57:34.761]  It's like New York, Madison Avenue prices down there.
[00:57:35.581 --> 00:57:36.962]  It's like South Congress.
[00:57:38.103 --> 00:57:39.785]  And they play hardball.
[00:57:39.805 --> 00:57:43.748]  They're telling people that own their property on South Congress they may bulldoze a bunch of it.
[00:57:44.525 --> 00:57:46.047]  To build big shops and things.
[00:57:47.408 --> 00:57:49.030]  Alright, I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[00:57:49.050 --> 00:57:50.412]  I haven't taken a lot of calls today.
[00:57:50.452 --> 00:57:52.834]  I'm just really wound up and upset about all of this.
[00:57:54.576 --> 00:57:58.220]  We will start the next hour and just rapid fire go to your calls.
[00:57:59.081 --> 00:58:02.465]  Briefly, in the last 60 seconds of this hour...

[00:59:00.054 --> 00:59:00.695]  Big Brother.
[00:59:01.375 --> 00:59:02.436]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:03.136 --> 00:59:04.237]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:04.897 --> 00:59:05.738]  You want answers?
[00:59:06.479 --> 00:59:07.399]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:11.742]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:12.222 --> 00:59:16.385]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.447 --> 00:59:24.311]  Coming up in 30 minutes...
[00:59:26.750 --> 00:59:47.882]  We have two of the homeowners who are going to have their property bulldozed, not because a bridge or canal is being brought through their area up in Connecticut, in their middle-class neighborhood, but because developers went to the city council and said, we want that property to build luxury condos and a bunch of other garbage.
[00:59:48.882 --> 00:59:52.124]  And so the city said, yes, if it can show it's an economic development...
[00:59:53.072 --> 00:59:58.134]  If it can show that it'll bring more jobs and more tax revenue, we can annihilate your property.
[00:59:58.174 --> 01:00:00.034]  You don't really own it.
[01:00:00.475 --> 01:00:08.297]  You can pay exorbitant property taxes on it, and then we can steal it whenever we want, and the same city that's going to steal it decides how much you get.
[01:00:08.317 --> 01:00:11.078]  So we've got several guests coming up.
[01:00:11.138 --> 01:00:16.040]  I'm told Ron Paul may be giving us an update sometime during the next two hours today as well.
[01:00:16.060 --> 01:00:21.722]  But right now, let's get through more of your calls, and I'm going to plunge into all of these masses of important news.
[01:00:23.186 --> 01:00:28.255]  Right now, let's talk to Charles in Louisiana, then Rita, Tim, Paul, and others.
[01:00:28.415 --> 01:00:29.116]  Go ahead, Charles.
[01:00:29.798 --> 01:00:33.203]  Mr. Jones, people ought to be outraged today.
[01:00:33.223 --> 01:00:35.047]  I mean, my God.
[01:00:35.669 --> 01:00:39.210]  What else can, you know, your property is the most important thing.
[01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:44.231]  How much, I mean, how much more, well, after your family it is, how much more obvious can it get?
[01:00:44.651 --> 01:00:45.292]  Well, it can't.
[01:00:45.512 --> 01:00:53.594]  Well, I mean, Dr. Phil says that parents don't control their, you know, don't have the word with their children that the state owns your children.
[01:00:54.662 --> 01:00:57.264]  Well, listen, Mr. Jones, let me just, I call it to say this.
[01:00:57.605 --> 01:01:01.088]  If people go along with this, they deserve what they get, sir.
[01:01:01.468 --> 01:01:02.109]  They deserve it.
[01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:06.432]  I'm saving all my cardboard boxes for my neighbors, like I told them last night at the meeting.
[01:01:06.873 --> 01:01:08.674]  I'm saving all my, they'll have a home.
[01:01:08.955 --> 01:01:11.837]  I'm saving cardboard where they'll be out to rain.
[01:01:12.278 --> 01:01:16.321]  I mean, these people here in Louisiana, I don't know what's wrong with these people.
[01:01:17.002 --> 01:01:21.826]  For six years since I've been listening to this program, for six years I've been beating the sidewalks.
[01:01:22.086 --> 01:01:23.186]  Well, actually, have faith, my friend.
[01:01:23.246 --> 01:01:23.767]  Keep the faith.
[01:01:23.787 --> 01:01:24.647]  People are waking up.
[01:01:24.687 --> 01:01:25.127]  People are upset.
[01:01:25.167 --> 01:01:26.107]  But you're right.
[01:01:26.147 --> 01:01:26.728]  They're afraid.
[01:01:41.693 --> 01:01:44.715]  Somehow they got it in their mind that it's bad to stand up.
[01:01:45.016 --> 01:01:46.036]  You don't think I'm afraid?
[01:01:46.136 --> 01:01:47.657]  I'm an ex-convict doing this.
[01:01:47.918 --> 01:01:50.279]  I'm in police stations once a week.
[01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:52.481]  You don't think I'm afraid, Mr. Jones?
[01:01:52.521 --> 01:01:58.625]  Well, a lot of the greatest leaders in history have been, quote, ex-convicts and so-called ne'er-do-wells, my friend.
[01:01:58.645 --> 01:02:01.027]  Well, I thank you for what you're doing, but I'm going to tell you something.
[01:02:01.067 --> 01:02:03.929]  People from Louisiana, they're building a golf course down here.
[01:02:03.949 --> 01:02:06.751]  They're going to make a loop in Baton Rouge on the highway.
[01:02:06.911 --> 01:02:08.773]  There's going to be hundreds of homes lost.
[01:02:09.473 --> 01:02:10.914]  I already checked on this yesterday.
[01:02:10.934 --> 01:02:16.995]  Hundreds of homes... But, sir, that's for a highway, which if they give somebody fair money could be argued.
[01:02:17.275 --> 01:02:24.897]  We're talking about any time a developer wants your property, any time the Lord wants to kick the serfs off their land, it happens.
[01:02:25.258 --> 01:02:25.638]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:25.938 --> 01:02:29.619]  Well, listen, people think... People's got to wake up.
[01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:33.960]  People's got to start going to the Capitol, and people's got to show their fury.
[01:02:34.200 --> 01:02:35.080]  I'll list my general...
[01:02:37.842 --> 01:02:40.964]  You know, aggression, they're putting on us a little out of town, a little out of town.
[01:02:41.044 --> 01:02:42.305]  It's over, Mr. Jones.
[01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:43.026]  It's over.
[01:02:43.046 --> 01:02:44.166]  What are they going to do next?
[01:02:44.547 --> 01:02:45.627]  They already got their children.
[01:02:45.647 --> 01:02:47.629]  They already took their children and put them on Prozac.
[01:02:47.929 --> 01:02:49.270]  They're not going to threaten their homes.
[01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:51.211]  If you wake up tomorrow and you've got a home, you're lucky.
[01:02:52.068 --> 01:02:52.548]  You know what I mean?
[01:02:52.628 --> 01:02:55.229]  Well, I mean, you really don't even own your home with property taxes.
[01:02:55.269 --> 01:02:57.450]  I mean, my property taxes go up 10% every year.
[01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:58.070]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:58.090 --> 01:02:59.371]  And that's the national average.
[01:02:59.511 --> 01:03:05.893]  Well, they said last night they could bulldoze your home if you need, you know, for advancement, you know, if they could prove it's for the economy.
[01:03:06.154 --> 01:03:07.614]  But it's all on the news.
[01:03:07.654 --> 01:03:08.675]  Everybody knows about it.
[01:03:08.715 --> 01:03:13.617]  No, they're saying that if they can get more property taxes, building something else there, it's gone.
[01:03:13.897 --> 01:03:17.098]  And the same, let me say this again, the same locales...
[01:03:17.856 --> 01:03:21.037]  That are doing this are going to pay you what they think it's worth.
[01:03:21.397 --> 01:03:21.778]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:22.138 --> 01:03:22.918]  So you've got to love it.
[01:03:23.238 --> 01:03:26.239]  Well, the people, if they don't stand up for this, they deserve it.
[01:03:26.279 --> 01:03:27.620]  They shouldn't write to you or nobody else.
[01:03:27.640 --> 01:03:30.181]  Well, sir, Al-Qaeda is hiding in homes.
[01:03:30.461 --> 01:03:33.703]  They've got to bulldoze these houses or Al-Qaeda is going to get us.
[01:03:33.963 --> 01:03:37.704]  And I'm asking people one more time, one more time, I beg them, get the tapes.
[01:03:38.004 --> 01:03:39.765]  Please give it to your neighbors and your family.
[01:03:39.905 --> 01:03:40.505]  Please.
[01:03:40.965 --> 01:03:42.286]  It's very, very vital.
[01:03:42.866 --> 01:03:44.547]  Well, have the videos been waking people up?
[01:03:45.293 --> 01:03:47.418]  Yeah, it's waking them up, but I can't get them to do nothing.
[01:03:47.879 --> 01:03:48.961]  They will in time, though.
[01:03:49.022 --> 01:03:49.823]  They will in time.
[01:03:49.924 --> 01:03:50.445]  That's right.
[01:03:50.725 --> 01:03:53.111]  We're waking them up, but then they're not doing anything with the knowledge.
[01:03:55.623 --> 01:04:02.468]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:04.150]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:04.350 --> 01:04:06.572]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:06.712 --> 01:04:08.813]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:09.074 --> 01:04:14.017]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:14.358 --> 01:04:18.381]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:19.082]  We're good to go.
[01:04:33.558 --> 01:04:37.202]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.
[01:04:37.342 --> 01:04:38.904]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:04:38.924 --> 01:04:39.304]  That's 888-2533-139.
[01:04:39.324 --> 01:04:41.726]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[01:04:41.746 --> 01:04:42.808]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[01:04:55.177 --> 01:04:56.778]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:56.918 --> 01:05:01.020]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:05:01.160 --> 01:05:04.062]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:04.122 --> 01:05:10.805]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:10.905 --> 01:05:11.205]  I think.
[01:05:27.205 --> 01:05:29.586]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:54.847 --> 01:05:57.189]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:57.449 --> 01:06:01.292]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:06:01.612 --> 01:06:02.413]  Read the labels.
[01:06:02.853 --> 01:06:06.976]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:07.196 --> 01:06:11.379]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:16.643]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:17.023 --> 01:06:20.584]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:20.784 --> 01:06:26.126]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:26.406 --> 01:06:29.126]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:29.427 --> 01:06:30.327]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:06:55.339 --> 01:07:03.004]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:05.825 --> 01:07:13.322]  William Vaughn Winkle, who's joining us in about 20 minutes, said this, I'm not going anywhere.
[01:07:13.522 --> 01:07:13.983]  I'm here.
[01:07:15.979 --> 01:07:21.383]  Said Von Winkle, who owns three buildings on what remains of Smith Street, I'm going to fight until they give up.
[01:07:21.683 --> 01:07:27.448]  They can do their little development around here with us here, or they can do no development and try to take it.
[01:07:27.848 --> 01:07:33.592]  Because until they stop trying to take my property by eminent domain, they will not build anything at Fort Trumbull.
[01:07:33.932 --> 01:07:35.113]  It's as simple as that.
[01:07:35.654 --> 01:07:37.775]  I don't know how they're going to get us out.
[01:07:38.736 --> 01:07:41.478]  Mr. Cristofaro, who's also coming on, agreed that
[01:07:42.173 --> 01:07:46.735]  We're going to keep our homes the bitter end because what they've done is wrong.
[01:07:47.595 --> 01:07:54.858]  And they warned every citizen of New London and the nation at large that the court's ruling stripped them of their right to own property.
[01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:56.659]  It did not strip you.
[01:07:56.739 --> 01:08:00.080]  Again, the Supreme Court said black people were not human beings.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:01.821]  And so they didn't have rights.
[01:08:01.881 --> 01:08:05.042]  They said Native Americans weren't human beings and didn't have rights.
[01:08:05.102 --> 01:08:06.363]  And we all know that's a fraud.
[01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:07.123]  If they said it today...
[01:08:07.882 --> 01:08:13.066]  If they said Germans weren't human beings today in America, would suddenly Germans not be human beings?
[01:08:14.688 --> 01:08:21.833]  One of the most fundamental rights that a country was built upon has pretty much been obliterated, said Scott Sawyer, a lawyer who represented the homeowners.
[01:08:22.234 --> 01:08:25.556]  Owning property doesn't seem to amount to much in the United States anymore.
[01:08:26.137 --> 01:08:29.520]  Certainly, none of us own our property anymore.
[01:08:30.861 --> 01:08:36.125]  Well, folks, they say that your property taxes will double in the next eight years, and double again.
[01:08:37.682 --> 01:08:38.863]  And you know how time flies.
[01:08:38.903 --> 01:08:40.303]  I mean, eight years is nothing.
[01:08:41.224 --> 01:08:44.185]  I mean, I have just a huge property tax bill.
[01:08:45.126 --> 01:08:46.246]  And it's way more.
[01:08:46.786 --> 01:08:47.547]  It's so strange.
[01:08:47.987 --> 01:08:50.668]  It's way more than what I bought my house for just a few years ago.
[01:08:51.468 --> 01:08:52.889]  I couldn't have sold my house for that.
[01:08:53.569 --> 01:09:02.994]  And I'd have to go spend days challenging it to maybe get it whittled down a little bit and some arbitrary judge board decides.
[01:09:05.459 --> 01:09:07.260]  And it gets worse and worse and worse.
[01:09:07.401 --> 01:09:12.805]  And all these illegal aliens all over this country, that's a big part of what's driving property tax up.
[01:09:12.845 --> 01:09:13.926]  Also just government greed.
[01:09:14.846 --> 01:09:16.407]  So you don't even really own your property.
[01:09:16.448 --> 01:09:17.969]  I mean, this is what feudalism was.
[01:09:18.049 --> 01:09:25.174]  You paid a yearly tax of around 25% of everything produced on that land.
[01:09:25.795 --> 01:09:26.535]  And you didn't own it.
[01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:27.716]  You were a tenant of it.
[01:09:28.277 --> 01:09:29.297]  Basically a sharecropper.
[01:09:30.278 --> 01:09:31.259]  And it's the same thing now.
[01:09:32.222 --> 01:09:35.644]  You know, you pay the government on average about 65% of everything you earn.
[01:09:35.664 --> 01:09:37.925]  And it's fiat currency to begin with.
[01:09:38.005 --> 01:09:39.185]  It's just control they're getting.
[01:09:40.266 --> 01:09:41.286]  And it's wrong.
[01:09:41.527 --> 01:09:42.627]  So those guests are coming up.
[01:09:43.407 --> 01:09:44.448]  Rita in Illinois.
[01:09:44.508 --> 01:09:45.148]  Rita, welcome.
[01:09:48.950 --> 01:09:52.292]  All right, Rita, are you going to talk to us or are you gone?
[01:09:54.413 --> 01:09:55.693]  All right, Tim in Ohio.
[01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:56.594]  You're up next, Tim.
[01:09:56.634 --> 01:09:57.034]  Go ahead.
[01:09:57.834 --> 01:09:58.495]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:09:58.555 --> 01:09:58.975]  I'm ready to go.
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:00.120]  Go ahead.
[01:10:00.381 --> 01:10:03.343]  A couple of things here that people need to research for themselves.
[01:10:03.603 --> 01:10:06.105]  They need to look at some of the legal maxims.
[01:10:06.165 --> 01:10:09.687]  I would suggest everyone find an unabridged copy of Black's Law Dictionary.
[01:10:10.588 --> 01:10:12.009]  No, that's Al-Qaeda.
[01:10:12.089 --> 01:10:13.270]  That's an Al-Qaeda manual.
[01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:16.432]  Sir, I don't want to hear about the Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[01:10:16.472 --> 01:10:18.433]  It's like Henry Hyde said when Ron Paul brought it up.
[01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:19.614]  It's obsolete.
[01:10:20.014 --> 01:10:20.535]  Shut up!
[01:10:20.755 --> 01:10:21.896]  You don't own your property!
[01:10:22.512 --> 01:10:23.413]  Doctrine of necessity.
[01:10:23.773 --> 01:10:24.833]  The government loves you!
[01:10:24.913 --> 01:10:27.014]  When you're in Goliath's court, Goliath rules.
[01:10:27.475 --> 01:10:32.537]  Something they can reach, because remember, when this country was being formed, they acquired land by what?
[01:10:32.597 --> 01:10:35.199]  War, by treaty, and by purchase.
[01:10:36.299 --> 01:10:44.744]  What you need to really investigate is land patents versus warranty deeds, because the Supreme Court has ruled that only a land patent
[01:10:45.772 --> 01:10:50.934]  I know, but I've seen cases where they disregard land patents and a lodeal title.
[01:10:51.254 --> 01:10:53.235]  Yeah, that's what they throw in the doctrine of necessity.
[01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:54.615]  Yeah, you're absolutely right.
[01:10:54.655 --> 01:10:57.616]  They do what they want, when they want, as long as it benefits them.
[01:10:58.137 --> 01:11:00.217]  Yeah, you know, I'm tired of all these lawyers...
[01:11:02.476 --> 01:11:10.059]  Private lawyers, people that claim that they know all these skills, and I watch them get people in trouble over and over again.
[01:11:10.619 --> 01:11:18.722]  Frankly, it is true that statistically pro se litigants are winning more cases than lawyers in America.
[01:11:19.677 --> 01:11:23.179]  But that's because there's just so many bad lawyers that don't even know what they're doing.
[01:11:23.439 --> 01:11:24.680]  Let me tell you how you win cases.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:27.801]  You go get the lawyer that plays golf with the judge.
[01:11:28.341 --> 01:11:32.543]  Okay, when I want to win a case, I go get the lawyer that plays golf with the judge.
[01:11:32.703 --> 01:11:33.304]  I'm serious.
[01:11:33.704 --> 01:11:33.924]  Okay?
[01:11:34.024 --> 01:11:35.565]  That's how you win cases in America.
[01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:36.785]  Did you know that?
[01:11:37.285 --> 01:11:42.208]  Yeah, when we had Scully hanging out with Dick Cheney, didn't we?
[01:11:42.248 --> 01:11:46.510]  Doing duck hunting right when his case was pending against the Supreme Court last year?
[01:11:47.170 --> 01:11:47.330]  Yep.
[01:11:48.531 --> 01:11:48.791]  Crazy.
[01:11:49.542 --> 01:11:53.164]  Well, I mean, I'm telling you, this is a very corrupt system, folks.
[01:11:53.985 --> 01:11:59.168]  And you pick your venue, and you use their system, or you look at what George Gordon does.
[01:11:59.208 --> 01:12:02.790]  George Gordon has won a lot of cases, even at the Supreme Court.
[01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:11.836]  And George Gordon tells you, the court system's a total fraud, it's a total scam, it's totally criminal, it's Roman civil law, and he uses their own corrupt system...
[01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:16.025]  Because he admits it's totally corrupt, and he wins a lot of cases.
[01:12:16.445 --> 01:12:19.546]  But these other people, you know, look, they're in another phase now.
[01:12:19.586 --> 01:12:25.389]  We're out of the phase where they had parallel legal systems and tried to hoodwink you into their system.
[01:12:25.589 --> 01:12:27.269]  They don't even care about that now, Tim.
[01:12:27.469 --> 01:12:27.890]  Exactly.
[01:12:28.630 --> 01:12:29.810]  And I see them, too.
[01:12:29.850 --> 01:12:37.914]  They're really, really pushing setting the table for the microchipping with all of these missing and abducted kids this past few months and the increased...
[01:12:38.967 --> 01:12:41.148]  The number of missing children is actually way down.
[01:12:41.269 --> 01:12:42.289]  Oh, sure.
[01:12:43.290 --> 01:12:44.910]  It's like up in Virginia.
[01:12:44.991 --> 01:12:45.851]  They create reality.
[01:12:45.891 --> 01:12:50.113]  In Richmond, they're getting martial law because there's been less shootings than last year.
[01:12:50.573 --> 01:12:51.834]  Sorry, we're going to have martial law.
[01:12:51.874 --> 01:12:54.816]  They actually say martial law in the Associated Press.
[01:12:55.716 --> 01:12:56.156]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:12:56.597 --> 01:13:01.639]  Stats are down since the 1980s for missing and abducting children.
[01:13:01.859 --> 01:13:02.359]  Since 1992.
[01:13:02.579 --> 01:13:08.542]  Do you remember last year, now two years ago, when Milwaukee tried to declare martial law?
[01:13:08.782 --> 01:13:09.722]  Right.
[01:13:09.742 --> 01:13:11.563]  It was in a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.
[01:13:12.003 --> 01:13:14.524]  The mayor and others were being exposed for corruption.
[01:13:16.225 --> 01:13:19.586]  So the city manager came out and said, let's just declare martial law.
[01:13:19.606 --> 01:13:21.607]  Then they can't get us in openly.
[01:13:22.008 --> 01:13:23.028]  They're so arrogant.
[01:13:23.957 --> 01:13:28.300]  In open council, they go, well, you know, we talked about martial law in closed session.
[01:13:28.521 --> 01:13:30.802]  Wouldn't that stop these investigations?
[01:13:31.102 --> 01:13:32.183]  I saw that in one of your films.
[01:13:32.203 --> 01:13:33.004]  Was that in Police State 3?
[01:13:33.184 --> 01:13:36.186]  Yeah, that article's in Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:38.828]  I mean, folks, I had guests on from the council.
[01:13:39.489 --> 01:13:42.771]  I mean, they openly just go, well, this will stop their corruption investigation.
[01:13:43.051 --> 01:13:44.652]  Can't we declare martial law?
[01:13:44.993 --> 01:13:47.435]  See, folks, that's what's going on behind closed doors.
[01:13:47.835 --> 01:13:53.199]  Now it's so normalized that it... Look, when mayors call you civilians...
[01:13:54.036 --> 01:14:01.579]  And themselves, the authorities and the honorable, and people walk into the council and bow their heads and go, oh, gracious.
[01:14:01.599 --> 01:14:03.300]  I mean, this is how they are locally in Austin.
[01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:05.421]  Gracious leader, please.
[01:14:05.821 --> 01:14:07.602]  I mean, how pathetic have we gotten?
[01:14:08.743 --> 01:14:11.364]  That voice there reminded me of the bush puppet in martial law.
[01:14:11.983 --> 01:14:13.745]  I'm glad you haven't lost your sense of humor.
[01:14:13.765 --> 01:14:14.766]  That was pretty funny.
[01:14:14.806 --> 01:14:17.548]  I must have watched that a hundred times in a row when I first got it.
[01:14:17.768 --> 01:14:19.390]  People ask me, you know, did I have that puppet?
[01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:25.915]  No, we're walking along, a lady's got a puppet, and I said, listen, just impromptu, instantly, I said, you run the puppet, I'm going to talk.
[01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:27.256]  That was pretty funny.
[01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:28.938]  And we did one take, and yeah, it's in the movie.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:42.846]  And one final question or comment or point that I'd like to make about all this is, you know, they say, well, we'll give this to this group of developers or to this corporation or to this and that, because isn't Eli Lilly one of the companies that's trying to take hold of some of this land?
[01:14:44.086 --> 01:14:45.927]  Sir, it's a whole bunch of different companies.
[01:14:45.967 --> 01:14:53.570]  And how can we actually expect to generate some tax revenue when these developers and these corporations come in and get the big tax abatements to begin with?
[01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:54.590]  It's all part of their lives.
[01:14:54.610 --> 01:14:56.531]  Well, who's not a part of Eli Lilly that you mentioned?
[01:14:56.651 --> 01:14:57.391]  Oh, Daddy Bush.
[01:14:57.471 --> 01:14:58.172]  Yeah, Daddy Bush.
[01:14:59.195 --> 01:14:59.836]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:00.036 --> 01:15:00.296]  Bye, Alex.
[01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:01.337]  Jim, great points.
[01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:04.779]  Let's go to Will in Virginia.
[01:15:04.819 --> 01:15:05.660]  Will, you're on the air.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:06.280]  Go ahead, Will.
[01:15:06.941 --> 01:15:07.221]  Hello.
[01:15:07.702 --> 01:15:08.162]  Yes, Will.
[01:15:08.262 --> 01:15:09.503]  Yeah, just a little short thing.
[01:15:09.523 --> 01:15:12.665]  A couple of years back I called and I gave you the phrase neo-feudalism.
[01:15:13.686 --> 01:15:14.607]  And I'll tell you this.
[01:15:15.464 --> 01:15:16.846]  Ruling doesn't make it official.
[01:15:16.906 --> 01:15:17.687]  I don't know what would.
[01:15:17.767 --> 01:15:19.589]  You gave me the term neo-feudalism?
[01:15:19.849 --> 01:15:20.770]  Well, I called in.
[01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:23.153]  I hadn't heard it before I called in.
[01:15:23.173 --> 01:15:24.515]  That was about two years ago.
[01:15:24.535 --> 01:15:25.456]  I remember the day I called you.
[01:15:25.916 --> 01:15:29.240]  Well, just so you know, I'll tell you when I take a phrase from somebody.
[01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:32.464]  I called it neo-feudalism probably ten years ago.
[01:15:32.584 --> 01:15:33.084]  Oh, you're welcome.
[01:15:33.104 --> 01:15:34.426]  I don't want to argue about it.
[01:15:34.446 --> 01:15:35.267]  I'm welcome to use it.
[01:15:36.249 --> 01:15:37.370]  I think it's apt.
[01:15:37.710 --> 01:15:38.730]  I don't care who said it.
[01:15:38.851 --> 01:15:39.931]  It is neo-feudalism.
[01:15:40.351 --> 01:15:43.513]  I think it's like inventing the wheel, really, this August.
[01:15:44.193 --> 01:15:45.934]  I think everybody invented it, yeah, at the same time.
[01:15:46.495 --> 01:15:49.116]  It's like 12 guys invented radio on the same day.
[01:15:49.496 --> 01:15:49.676]  Yeah.
[01:15:50.637 --> 01:15:54.619]  Anyway, I think, really, it's official.
[01:15:54.799 --> 01:16:00.262]  I mean, it's just like the kings would give the lords rule over their lands, I guess.
[01:16:00.322 --> 01:16:03.344]  Now the federal governments give the local governments rule over their lands.
[01:16:04.383 --> 01:16:05.543]  Well, that's what the court said.
[01:16:05.604 --> 01:16:06.424]  It just said no.
[01:16:06.484 --> 01:16:11.746]  It's just up to your local constabulary, and they have the special voting machines in so they can keep their people in.
[01:16:12.446 --> 01:16:23.531]  And so they say 90-plus percent of you don't like it, 99% don't like it, 95% don't like toll roads, or 98% in Houston, 92% in Austin.
[01:16:23.591 --> 01:16:24.791]  I average and say 95%.
[01:16:25.692 --> 01:16:26.612]  Just vote us out.
[01:16:26.672 --> 01:16:30.974]  And then the mayor actually laughs because he knows there's nothing you can do.
[01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:44.395]  They got the voting machines in, they got cops with machine guns, they got armored vehicles, they got giant prisons, but again, the people are waking up, and when we just refuse to go along with it, their system's going to fall apart.
[01:16:44.935 --> 01:16:49.377]  Yeah, I do have a few friends who are very non-political, but this is starting to wake them up.
[01:16:49.597 --> 01:16:51.939]  Like, what in the world is going on now?
[01:16:53.299 --> 01:16:55.000]  And trying to catch them up.
[01:16:55.420 --> 01:16:56.761]  Well, Will, thanks for the call.
[01:16:57.041 --> 01:16:58.182]  I appreciate your fine points.
[01:16:59.306 --> 01:17:02.607]  You know, I've got a t-shirt a listener sent me five years ago.
[01:17:02.947 --> 01:17:03.807]  He sent me two of them.
[01:17:04.027 --> 01:17:07.288]  Black t-shirt, says Real Talk Radio on it.
[01:17:08.668 --> 01:17:10.649]  Because that's how I would always announce my show.
[01:17:10.669 --> 01:17:13.769]  This is Real Talk Radio, real issues of real significance.
[01:17:13.789 --> 01:17:15.250]  That was always my little tagline.
[01:17:16.270 --> 01:17:22.071]  And then over the years I'm told, hey, that's not the name of your show, that's the name of another show.
[01:17:22.572 --> 01:17:22.812]  No.
[01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.052]  That's not the name of my show.
[01:17:25.392 --> 01:17:28.373]  This is Real Talk Radio, where we talk about real issues of real significance.
[01:17:29.022 --> 01:17:32.164]  And I coined, now people tell me I didn't coin.
[01:17:32.184 --> 01:17:38.948]  I heard somebody about a year ago say they coined the term propaganda placement.
[01:17:40.749 --> 01:17:41.890]  Well, I coined that.
[01:17:42.210 --> 01:17:46.073]  And frankly, again, it's never about who coins stuff or who says it first.
[01:17:46.993 --> 01:17:52.997]  It's just that when I say something first or I do something first, then it is annoying at a certain level.
[01:17:53.951 --> 01:17:57.533]  I mean, that's why I never talked about being the father of the 9-11 Truth Movement, which I am.
[01:17:57.974 --> 01:18:05.198]  But other people were declaring themselves that and then saying, as the founder, as the father, I tell you, Alex, you are bad.
[01:18:06.419 --> 01:18:11.562]  So, I mean, if you want to say that, as if it has some authority in it, then fine.
[01:18:12.182 --> 01:18:16.825]  I mean, I will then, if you're going to put the mantle on, I'm going to take it away from you and put it where it belongs.
[01:18:18.286 --> 01:18:19.627]  Just an interesting little point there.
[01:18:21.702 --> 01:18:24.965]  Like the bumper sticker says, I've been there and I've got the t-shirt to prove it.
[01:18:26.606 --> 01:18:28.968]  All right, I really need to shut up.
[01:18:29.248 --> 01:18:33.472]  I've been out of control lately, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:35.854 --> 01:18:37.496]  You know what, I'm going to cover news when we get back.
[01:18:37.616 --> 01:18:39.398]  Clinton to stay at Bush Sr.'

[01:18:40.639 --> 01:18:43.021]  Oh, yes.
[01:18:43.041 --> 01:18:46.524]  Because there's such a difference between the parties.
[01:18:47.305 --> 01:18:47.425]  Uh-huh.
[01:18:48.449 --> 01:18:49.011]  Uh-huh.
[01:18:49.071 --> 01:18:51.299]  Rush Limbaugh will save you from Clanton.

[01:20:48.157 --> 01:20:53.439]  Many people have wondered what has happened to the once great United States of America while the moral decay that has been taking place within it.
[01:21:03.880 --> 01:21:07.963]  The United States has been targeted for overthrow for world government.
[01:21:08.663 --> 01:21:15.728]  The United Nations has been established to redistribute the wealth of the world away from the United States, Great Britain, and Western Europe.
[01:21:16.609 --> 01:21:25.375]  You need to know, as a specific individual citizen of the United States of America, why these things are happening and what you can do about it.

[01:21:55.856 --> 01:21:59.217]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:21:59.457 --> 01:21:59.797]  Why?
[01:21:59.817 --> 01:22:02.759]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[01:22:44.462 --> 01:22:45.702]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:45.722 --> 01:22:46.983]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:22:47.063 --> 01:22:50.003]  Folks, I'll tell you how you stop the type of stuff that's going on in New London.
[01:23:14.346 --> 01:23:22.050]  You go show how the developers gave money to the city council, guaranteed they broke different campaign finance laws.
[01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:22.870]  They always do.
[01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:24.591]  It's always selectively enforced.
[01:23:25.411 --> 01:23:26.792]  You make a big deal out of that.
[01:23:26.852 --> 01:23:37.997]  You show where city council members, and I'm sure you can find one, it's always the same, has investments with those firms in real estate, and then you make a big deal out of it.
[01:23:39.978 --> 01:23:41.759]  And so, you know, that's what you do.
[01:23:42.019 --> 01:23:44.540]  There's always many ways to skin a cat.
[01:23:46.701 --> 01:23:50.082]  And then if you're really mad about it, I mean, you hire a private investigator.
[01:23:51.563 --> 01:23:53.144]  You've got to put money up in any fight.
[01:23:53.764 --> 01:23:55.005]  You've got to choose your battles, too.
[01:23:55.585 --> 01:23:58.126]  But you hire a private investigator to follow them around.
[01:23:59.526 --> 01:24:01.127]  And you publish dirt on them.
[01:24:01.587 --> 01:24:02.868]  They want to steal your house.
[01:24:03.408 --> 01:24:05.149]  You're not getting justice.
[01:24:05.929 --> 01:24:07.590]  You're not getting justice through this system.
[01:24:08.274 --> 01:24:09.414]  Well, these people are crooks.
[01:24:09.434 --> 01:24:10.515]  They're always crooks.
[01:24:11.635 --> 01:24:15.096]  And so you need to get that corruption and lay it out for everybody.
[01:24:15.856 --> 01:24:17.576]  This isn't a game we're playing.
[01:24:17.596 --> 01:24:20.817]  This isn't tiddlywinks or backgammon or croquet.
[01:24:21.777 --> 01:24:23.357]  This is about life and death, folks.
[01:24:24.978 --> 01:24:33.019]  And again, there's more ways than one to skin a cat or one of these possums.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.280]  One of these evil possums.
[01:24:36.379 --> 01:24:38.000]  Clinton to stay at Bush Sr.'
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:39.421]  's Coneybunkport home.
[01:24:40.001 --> 01:24:42.783]  Republican mutterings over former President H.W.
[01:24:42.803 --> 01:24:44.884]  Bush's budding.
[01:24:45.064 --> 01:24:51.107]  Oh, it budded a long time ago, back in the CIA, with one-time arch-rival Bill Clinton are growing.
[01:24:52.348 --> 01:25:02.934]  What started when President Bush put the two foes on the tsunami relief parade has some GOPers worried that the old man and the wife, Barbara, have fallen for Bubba.
[01:25:04.329 --> 01:25:08.292]  Oh, they fell a long time ago for Bubba when they recruited him into the intelligence agencies.
[01:25:08.972 --> 01:25:09.853]  And now this.
[01:25:09.993 --> 01:25:14.976]  Clinton staying at Bush's Kinnebunkport main summer home during a book tour this month.
[01:25:15.376 --> 01:25:15.896]  Why care?
[01:25:15.936 --> 01:25:23.801]  Republicans fret that the ties might profit the Bushes to pull punches against Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton if she runs in L.A.
[01:25:24.602 --> 01:25:30.826]  Folks, the New York Observer admits that Hillary and Rupert Murdoch are inseparable.
[01:25:32.837 --> 01:25:34.398]  It's totally staged.
[01:25:34.999 --> 01:25:36.700]  You know, Bush and Kerry are cousins.
[01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:38.322]  They vacationed together in the past.
[01:25:38.882 --> 01:25:40.764]  They're related on every side of their family.
[01:25:40.824 --> 01:25:43.606]  I mean, what does it take for you to know they're Skull and Bones brothers?
[01:25:45.368 --> 01:25:46.809]  No, it's real.
[01:25:46.949 --> 01:25:49.231]  And Hulk Hogan and Macho Man are real.
[01:25:49.731 --> 01:25:52.754]  The Undertaker and the New World Order wrestling team are real.
[01:25:53.194 --> 01:25:54.215]  It's all real.
[01:25:54.235 --> 01:25:54.295]  Yes.
[01:25:57.819 --> 01:26:01.622]  Former Assistant Secretary of Treasury under Reagan, doubts official 9-11 story.
[01:26:01.662 --> 01:26:04.124]  Now another insider blowing the whistle.
[01:26:04.185 --> 01:26:05.265]  I'll get more into that later.
[01:26:06.446 --> 01:26:08.368]  Hagel, Senator Hagel, U.S.
[01:26:08.408 --> 01:26:09.649]  losing Iraq war.
[01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:11.171]  That's out of Newsmax.
[01:26:12.091 --> 01:26:15.334]  Congress mulls support for Saddam's terrorist Mujahideen.
[01:26:15.915 --> 01:26:21.720]  Critics blast anthrax vaccine test, experimental to be tested, on 100 children.
[01:26:21.740 --> 01:26:24.202]  I wonder if it'll be children grabbed by CPS.
[01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:28.555]  When they're normally testing experimental drugs or pesticides on them.
[01:26:29.175 --> 01:26:35.657]  Former IRS CID Special Agent Joseph Bannister acquitted of tax fraud and conspiracy.
[01:26:35.677 --> 01:26:41.619]  I remember when I first interviewed Bannister, literally the first, on video.
[01:26:42.060 --> 01:26:42.820]  It's in my film.
[01:26:43.863 --> 01:26:46.304]  Comprehensive annual financial reports exposed.
[01:26:46.724 --> 01:26:47.285]  A great guy.
[01:26:47.605 --> 01:27:10.936]  A federal jury found a former IRS criminal investigative division special agent CPA Joseph Bannister not guilty of all counts alleging criminal tax fraud and conspiracy related to actions he took on behalf of a California business owner who had openly defied the IRS over several years of stopping withholding on all income and employment taxes from paychecks on his workers.
[01:27:11.076 --> 01:27:12.437]  And Bannister just offended him.
[01:27:13.795 --> 01:27:15.236]  He heard a talk show with D.V.
[01:27:15.296 --> 01:27:17.838]  Kidd on mainstream radio in California.
[01:27:18.518 --> 01:27:20.099]  And for two years he researched her.
[01:27:20.139 --> 01:27:21.360]  He said, that lady's a liar.
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.582]  I'm going to prove her a liar and we're going to get her and arrest her.
[01:27:25.343 --> 01:27:28.084]  And he went and he found out it was all through and worse.
[01:27:28.285 --> 01:27:33.888]  Offshore corporations, Federal Reserves, private total scam, a receivership corporation.
[01:27:33.908 --> 01:27:35.930]  He got all the federal documents, couldn't believe it.
[01:27:36.310 --> 01:27:40.693]  Took it to his officials and said, I'll have to resign if you can't disprove this.
[01:27:40.733 --> 01:27:42.394]  And they said, we want your resignation tomorrow.
[01:27:44.409 --> 01:28:05.673]  During the trial, the Department of Justice was unable to put forth any evidence that Bannister had either engaged in conspiracy or had acted unlawfully when he shared legal research with business owner Al Thompson concerning that he had no legal obligation to withhold taxes from his workers or when he, Bannister, prepared corrected tax returns for Thompson claiming his taxable income was under U.S.
[01:28:05.733 --> 01:28:06.513]  law zero.
[01:28:07.774 --> 01:28:09.254]  And again, why is it zero?
[01:28:10.043 --> 01:28:14.386]  Because the corporations wrote this for themselves, where they pay zero.
[01:28:15.247 --> 01:28:20.250]  Did you know that these offshore corps, like Enron and others, don't have to pay tax?
[01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:21.030]  Their employees do?
[01:28:21.931 --> 01:28:22.471]  Did you know that?
[01:28:22.812 --> 01:28:23.032]  See?
[01:28:23.552 --> 01:28:23.772]  See?
[01:28:24.513 --> 01:28:26.434]  But that's all selectively done.
[01:28:26.454 --> 01:28:31.738]  The Constitution, the Bill of Rights, clearly says an income tax is totally illegal.
[01:28:32.458 --> 01:28:33.719]  You know where you will find it, though?
[01:28:34.751 --> 01:28:38.196]  One of the planks of the ten planks of the Communist Manifesto.
[01:28:38.556 --> 01:28:39.137]  I'm not kidding.
[01:28:39.157 --> 01:28:39.637]  Go read it.
[01:28:40.979 --> 01:28:41.680]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:41.700 --> 01:28:42.080]  Stay with us.
[01:28:46.145 --> 01:28:47.067]  We're on the march.
[01:28:47.547 --> 01:28:49.129]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:49.149 --> 01:28:52.754]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.501]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[01:28:57.681 --> 01:28:59.703]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[01:28:59.903 --> 01:29:00.583]  Prepare yourself.
[01:29:00.763 --> 01:29:04.406]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[01:29:14.712 --> 01:29:16.273]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.

[01:29:25.723 --> 01:29:26.163]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:29:56.056 --> 01:30:01.019]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[01:30:01.319 --> 01:30:03.561]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating.
[01:30:03.621 --> 01:30:06.743]  Or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:30:06.803 --> 01:30:11.105]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[01:30:11.426 --> 01:30:14.448]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:14.768 --> 01:30:18.190]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:27.872]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkeys patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:28.112 --> 01:30:31.633]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:30:31.873 --> 01:30:38.975]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:30:55.376 --> 01:30:55.816]  We're good to go.
[01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:16.952]  Northern Voice Bookstore offers a broad range of different perspectives.
[01:31:29.617 --> 01:31:30.137]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.177 --> 01:31:30.737]  We're good to go.
[01:31:55.783 --> 01:32:24.595]  All right, Michael Cristofano, one of the business and homeowners in New London, Connecticut, where the local government is trying to steal their property just for developers.
[01:32:26.605 --> 01:32:28.066]  Is going to be joining us.
[01:32:28.086 --> 01:32:29.288]  He got his time zones off.
[01:32:29.308 --> 01:32:33.092]  He called us last hour, which I understand that's easy to happen.
[01:32:34.794 --> 01:32:45.386]  And so he's scheduled next hour, but then William Von Winkle, who's really standing up, we're calling his cell phone and he's not answering.
[01:32:46.346 --> 01:32:53.191]  So, what we're going to do is get Michael Cristofano, or one of these two, they should be on shortly.
[01:32:53.871 --> 01:33:00.936]  We're juggling that right now, so I'll just go back to calls here for a moment while we're getting that straightened out, and then get into the big stack of news here.
[01:33:04.364 --> 01:33:05.705]  Great success last night.
[01:33:05.745 --> 01:33:07.246]  Alamo Draft House, fifth showing.
[01:33:07.607 --> 01:33:11.790]  The sixth and final showing will be next Monday, 8 o'clock.
[01:33:11.870 --> 01:33:14.632]  Alamo Draft House, beautiful cinema, brand new.
[01:33:14.692 --> 01:33:20.097]  South Lamar in their biggest theater of the five screens they've got in that theater.
[01:33:21.138 --> 01:33:24.300]  Your own personal table to eat and drink while you watch the film.
[01:33:24.320 --> 01:33:27.343]  A lot of great stuff on the menu.
[01:33:27.503 --> 01:33:28.403]  Ice cream, you name it.
[01:33:28.624 --> 01:33:31.286]  I certainly enjoy that place a little too much, folks.
[01:33:31.306 --> 01:33:32.607]  I had a little too much fun last night.
[01:33:35.033 --> 01:33:35.733]  I'm on a diet.
[01:33:35.773 --> 01:33:37.454]  I can't be eating pizzas and ice cream.
[01:33:38.515 --> 01:33:41.558]  But seriously, I want to see you out there this Monday.
[01:33:41.578 --> 01:33:43.579]  This will be the last time I do it for a while.
[01:33:44.300 --> 01:33:46.762]  It's been a year and a half since the last time I showed a film.
[01:33:48.023 --> 01:33:49.004]  And I'm just so busy.
[01:33:49.644 --> 01:33:54.628]  We might do some rolling road show where we do it outdoors in the fall.
[01:33:54.668 --> 01:33:57.831]  They've had other rolling road shows where thousands of people have showed up.
[01:33:57.851 --> 01:34:00.013]  They have a huge inflatable screen.
[01:34:00.934 --> 01:34:02.574]  We might do it downtown on the river.
[01:34:02.594 --> 01:34:04.275]  It's just too hot right now.
[01:34:04.335 --> 01:34:06.255]  We might do it somewhere else.
[01:34:07.415 --> 01:34:13.436]  Next Monday, last time for quite a while, so go to InfoWars.com, link over to the Elmo Draft House website.
[01:34:13.796 --> 01:34:14.417]  Get your tickets.
[01:34:14.437 --> 01:34:15.657]  They're going fast, folks.
[01:34:15.817 --> 01:34:16.857]  Going very fast.
[01:34:17.377 --> 01:34:18.097]  Aren't many left.
[01:34:18.137 --> 01:34:20.898]  About a quarter of the tickets were left last night.
[01:34:22.518 --> 01:34:24.518]  So, who knows?
[01:34:24.698 --> 01:34:27.439]  They usually hold about 10-15 back at the door.
[01:34:28.288 --> 01:34:30.009]  So that they don't overflow.
[01:34:30.089 --> 01:34:39.512]  So if you're the first people to line up Monday night, right at show time, because that always happens, you might be able to get a few tickets there.
[01:34:40.573 --> 01:34:45.875]  Or you can drive by right now if you live in Austin to South Lamar and get your tickets for next Monday.
[01:34:45.895 --> 01:34:52.257]  And folks, we had people from Maui, Hawaii, a guy who works for the airlines and has a lot of extra frequent flyer miles.
[01:34:52.717 --> 01:34:54.518]  He flew down from New Jersey.
[01:34:56.659 --> 01:34:57.499]  Really great guy.
[01:34:58.852 --> 01:35:05.057]  So, there are just so many great people that travel from far and wide to come here, and again, I'm humbled, I'm flattered.
[01:35:05.838 --> 01:35:15.846]  If you want to find out why people like this film so much, why it's so powerful, why it's waking so many people up, if you want to learn the terrifying secret that holds the future of the world in its grasp...
[01:35:17.324 --> 01:35:20.867]  Then you really need to call toll-free to get Martial Law or any of my other films.
[01:35:21.147 --> 01:35:22.788]  Got huge discounts going right now.
[01:35:22.828 --> 01:35:23.809]  Be sure to ask about those.
[01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:27.252]  Upwards of 75% off on some of the films.
[01:35:27.272 --> 01:35:30.114]  So, 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001.
[01:35:42.683 --> 01:35:47.044]  South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:35:47.905 --> 01:36:00.328]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv, see all 12 of my films, dozens of special reports, hundreds of my TV shows, hundreds of audio interviews, my book, Paul Watson's book, it's ridiculous.
[01:36:00.708 --> 01:36:09.311]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions, 15 cents a day, a cup of coffee costs you $1.50, you know, a small or a toll, to use their doublespeak,
[01:36:09.892 --> 01:36:11.214]  At Starbucks.
[01:36:11.334 --> 01:36:12.797]  So, come on!
[01:36:12.837 --> 01:36:15.641]  You can afford it, and it makes what we do here possible.
[01:36:16.022 --> 01:36:18.987]  presentplanet.tv or order via infowars.com.
[01:36:19.247 --> 01:36:20.890]  Hard copies.
[01:36:20.930 --> 01:36:22.713]  Let's go to Michael in Kentucky.
[01:36:23.658 --> 01:36:24.739]  How you doing there, sir?
[01:36:25.079 --> 01:36:25.960]  Well, I'm alright.
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:30.044]  It's a little hot up here today, but, you know, that's just because we're not used to it yet.
[01:36:30.285 --> 01:36:31.205]  Oh, don't whine about it.
[01:36:31.245 --> 01:36:32.306]  You know it's hotter down here.
[01:36:33.067 --> 01:36:35.109]  Well, it's the dry heat, though.
[01:36:36.010 --> 01:36:37.211]  The dry heat's good.
[01:36:37.271 --> 01:36:40.594]  Welcome to the soup of Kentucky, which is, yeah, whatever.
[01:36:40.655 --> 01:36:42.016]  Have you been to Texas, Michael?
[01:36:42.256 --> 01:36:43.538]  The Sauna of Kentucky.
[01:36:43.638 --> 01:36:44.639]  No, I haven't been to Texas.
[01:36:44.679 --> 01:36:47.202]  Okay, well that is an oxymoron.
[01:36:47.582 --> 01:36:48.423]  It's an urban legend.
[01:36:48.884 --> 01:36:52.428]  Only about 40% of the state is arid, desert.
[01:36:53.088 --> 01:36:56.492]  The rest is like rolling plains or swampland.
[01:36:56.933 --> 01:37:02.419]  I've seen some beautiful pictures of reservoirs with forests around them that look just like around here.
[01:37:03.084 --> 01:37:06.006]  Sir, we got tropical birds in some parts of Texas.
[01:37:06.066 --> 01:37:07.427]  Just like a whole other country.
[01:37:08.068 --> 01:37:09.489]  It is a whole other country, brother.
[01:37:10.029 --> 01:37:11.090]  Come on down!
[01:37:11.610 --> 01:37:12.371]  I may have to.
[01:37:12.791 --> 01:37:19.156]  Well, Joe Bannister, I guess, has had some sort of, at least a temporary victory with a court case.
[01:37:19.216 --> 01:37:24.140]  I was wondering if you've got that as an iron in your fire there, like you've got enough already, but...
[01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:26.661]  You know, I don't know what's going on.
[01:37:27.121 --> 01:37:28.682]  I've had Bannister on many times.
[01:37:28.702 --> 01:37:32.785]  I have called his house in the last six months over and over again.
[01:37:32.805 --> 01:37:34.345]  I haven't heard him on talk radio.
[01:37:34.826 --> 01:37:40.729]  I think Joe is just incredibly busy and fighting his court case.
[01:37:41.569 --> 01:37:42.390]  He's now won.
[01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:43.970]  He won a court case, though.
[01:37:44.431 --> 01:37:52.295]  A lot of people are really kind of celebrating that, but of course it's probably going to be appealed and derailed, but
[01:37:53.622 --> 01:37:59.225]  I think it's all over the, what's his name, Bob, the guy that did the Hunger Strike of We the People?
[01:37:59.546 --> 01:37:59.806]  Yes.
[01:38:00.006 --> 01:38:04.489]  It's on their webpage today and several others, I think, what really happened.
[01:38:04.509 --> 01:38:05.590]  You've had him on before.
[01:38:06.310 --> 01:38:09.413]  But Michael Rivera or whatever's got it on there, too.
[01:38:09.573 --> 01:38:10.954]  Yeah, we got it on prisonplanet.com.
[01:38:11.054 --> 01:38:11.754]  Oh, okay.
[01:38:11.774 --> 01:38:13.155]  Well, I haven't got there yet today.
[01:38:13.435 --> 01:38:14.816]  Well, it's not a good website.
[01:38:14.836 --> 01:38:15.517]  You don't want to visit it.
[01:38:15.737 --> 01:38:16.017]  What?
[01:38:16.498 --> 01:38:17.578]  Do not visit that site.
[01:38:17.878 --> 01:38:18.179]  Why?
[01:38:18.459 --> 01:38:19.660]  I'm using reverse psychology.
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:19.920]  Oh, okay.
[01:38:21.847 --> 01:38:26.750]  That was a joke Michael!
[01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:28.411]  I'm with you on that now.
[01:38:29.732 --> 01:38:33.995]  Anyway, the direction the economy is going with a lot of the
[01:38:34.998 --> 01:38:37.138]  Added value stuff like manufacturing.
[01:38:37.158 --> 01:38:38.699]  The economy's going wonderfully.
[01:38:38.739 --> 01:38:39.819]  The news told me so.
[01:38:41.219 --> 01:38:43.059]  And we've got more freedoms now.
[01:38:43.099 --> 01:38:43.940]  The news said so.
[01:38:44.140 --> 01:38:49.441]  This eminent domain thing, the only way they can go is to tear down stuff and rebuild it.
[01:38:49.481 --> 01:38:51.681]  That's going to stimulate the economy, right?
[01:38:51.921 --> 01:38:55.362]  Let me tell you why they're first and foremost doing this.
[01:38:55.402 --> 01:38:57.062]  They're a pack of criminal tyrants.
[01:38:57.402 --> 01:38:58.782]  They've always done this throughout history.
[01:38:58.822 --> 01:39:00.422]  But the main reason is this.
[01:39:01.023 --> 01:39:03.623]  They can't have the serves with real currency.
[01:39:04.565 --> 01:39:10.069]  And so the money is a false fiat currency that can be devalued instantly and is being devalued.
[01:39:10.389 --> 01:39:13.632]  One of the last currencies are skills.
[01:39:14.992 --> 01:39:16.113]  You're always going to need a dentist.
[01:39:16.834 --> 01:39:19.356]  You're always going to need farmers until it's all big agribusiness.
[01:39:19.376 --> 01:39:21.517]  You're always going to need computer programmers.
[01:39:21.637 --> 01:39:28.222]  So skills are one currency, but they try to undercut that with slave wages from third world countries.
[01:39:29.088 --> 01:39:29.869]  And then property.
[01:39:30.289 --> 01:39:34.512]  Property is the ultimate form of currency and the generator of all wealth.
[01:39:35.412 --> 01:39:42.097]  And so they cannot have... I mean, you know, a 10% national increase is higher in some areas and obviously lower.
[01:39:42.377 --> 01:39:45.639]  National average 10-point-something percent increase every year in property tax.
[01:39:45.879 --> 01:39:46.680]  What is it, 10.3?
[01:39:47.320 --> 01:39:48.181]  That was for 94.
[01:39:49.362 --> 01:39:55.446]  If that isn't enough to run us off the property as surf tenants, neo-surfs, then this will do it, brother.
[01:39:56.252 --> 01:40:14.095]  Well, maybe the homeless folks beside the road, instead of having cardboard signs that say, homeless vet, God bless, maybe they should get a little more creative and have the little cardboard sign that says, we'll work for more money than illegal aliens.
[01:40:15.137 --> 01:40:15.257]  Ah!
[01:40:15.437 --> 01:40:16.018]  Wouldn't that work?
[01:40:16.038 --> 01:40:17.858]  I mean, it'll make people think, too.
[01:40:18.118 --> 01:40:20.459]  We'll work for less money than illegal aliens.
[01:40:20.599 --> 01:40:21.500]  No.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.880]  Well, then why would you be standing there?
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:30.143]  You could probably find all kinds of work if you'd work for less than illegal aliens, but if you want a living wage, you're going to be standing on the side of the road for a long time.
[01:40:30.163 --> 01:40:30.583]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:40:30.603 --> 01:40:33.044]  Yeah, if you live in the system, you cannot survive.
[01:40:33.204 --> 01:40:33.884]  Most people can't.
[01:40:34.084 --> 01:40:41.827]  But if you live 150-something to one house with everybody having whooping cough, as the statesmen reported two days ago, then yeah, it's just wonderful.
[01:40:42.247 --> 01:40:42.728]  Or, yeah...
[01:40:44.474 --> 01:40:46.716]  Drug-resistant whatever.
[01:40:47.877 --> 01:40:52.660]  Drug-resistant... Hey, 7,000 cases of leprosy.
[01:40:52.701 --> 01:40:53.761]  That's freedom, sir.
[01:40:54.002 --> 01:40:55.783]  Hey, yeah, we're turning into a leprosom.
[01:40:55.823 --> 01:40:58.205]  We used to have like 5, 10 cases a year on average.
[01:40:58.225 --> 01:40:59.946]  That was in the GDC report.
[01:41:00.006 --> 01:41:00.206]  Now 7,000!
[01:41:00.927 --> 01:41:03.709]  Man, that's wonderful, isn't it?
[01:41:04.810 --> 01:41:05.811]  Leprosy, man!
[01:41:06.491 --> 01:41:07.152]  Great stuff.
[01:41:07.372 --> 01:41:08.753]  Globalism, I like it.
[01:41:08.833 --> 01:41:10.855]  Yeah, free trade, it's fair.
[01:41:10.895 --> 01:41:11.655]  Leprosy, baby.
[01:41:11.675 --> 01:41:13.477]  It's going to stimulate the economy.
[01:41:15.402 --> 01:41:16.363]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:41:16.763 --> 01:41:18.305]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[01:41:19.206 --> 01:41:23.349]  Very evil, Al-Qaeda-ish person calling in.
[01:41:23.389 --> 01:41:24.330]  I mean, he's for freedom.
[01:41:24.370 --> 01:41:24.811]  He's evil.
[01:41:25.631 --> 01:41:27.813]  All right, let's talk to Mark in Pennsylvania.
[01:41:27.853 --> 01:41:28.634]  Mark, you're on the air.
[01:41:28.674 --> 01:41:29.114]  Go ahead.
[01:41:31.597 --> 01:41:31.817]  Alex?
[01:41:32.277 --> 01:41:32.978]  Yes, Mark.
[01:41:33.378 --> 01:41:34.219]  I have a question.
[01:41:34.359 --> 01:41:36.021]  I wasn't able to get in yesterday.
[01:41:37.882 --> 01:41:41.806]  I was wondering what the Banking Institute's position on this is, you know, with
[01:41:42.208 --> 01:41:47.869]  With the way things are today, it's not uncommon for people to have their houses mortgaged for more than their actual value.
[01:41:48.889 --> 01:42:00.912]  So if they came in and say, I had a $200,000 house and it was mortgaged at $250,000, and I've only been in it for three years, I mean, how do they plan on taking that?
[01:42:00.952 --> 01:42:02.972]  They call that being upside down.
[01:42:02.992 --> 01:42:04.493]  I mean, how can they do that?
[01:42:04.593 --> 01:42:06.293]  I mean, the bank is going to be up in arms.
[01:42:06.313 --> 01:42:11.154]  They're not going to let them take that property for less than what it's mortgaged for at that point.
[01:42:12.222 --> 01:42:21.264]  Well, you know, that's one of the rare cases, but let me just tell you from... We've been talking about this New London, Connecticut story for two years as it heated up.
[01:42:22.064 --> 01:42:26.045]  And I've actually interviewed some of the locals before who, by the way, are about to be on with us.
[01:42:27.486 --> 01:42:37.348]  And understand, all over the country, sir, the same cities or counties that grab property because developers want it to build new houses or whatever... Mm-hmm.
[01:42:38.950 --> 01:42:51.601]  In case after case after case, they will give you less than market value, and then you've got to go appeal, and in most cases you lose those appeals, to the very city that is raping you.
[01:42:52.181 --> 01:43:00.468]  So this is like the person who is robbing your house of your computers and televisions and jewelry, and then you go into court, and the guy that did it is the judge.
[01:43:02.591 --> 01:43:14.315]  So what you're saying is that you would still be responsible for the balance due at the bank after they paid you the small sum that they said what it would be worth.
[01:43:15.055 --> 01:43:17.756]  I would even say small sum.
[01:43:18.096 --> 01:43:22.577]  Generally, it's a large sum, but it just means you probably won't get any equity.
[01:43:23.017 --> 01:43:26.158]  You'll be ripped off whatever the amount of the...
[01:43:29.071 --> 01:43:29.451]  Yeah.
[01:43:29.571 --> 01:43:30.432]  Yeah, that's nice.
[01:43:30.772 --> 01:43:31.212]  In the mail.
[01:43:56.047 --> 01:43:58.869]  And I was smart enough to have one credit card and I didn't get into debt.
[01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:06.235]  But I know just so many people that get these credit cards when they're in college or whatever or poor.
[01:44:06.895 --> 01:44:18.484]  As soon as I made a little bit of money, as soon as I, in the prospectus, wouldn't be somebody who was apt to go into deep debt, I get a credit card in the mail every month.
[01:44:19.425 --> 01:44:20.766]  Not every week or every day.
[01:44:21.307 --> 01:44:24.249]  Literally, folks, I'd open the mailbox sometimes and there'd be three cards in there.
[01:44:25.071 --> 01:44:26.892]  You know, instant qualification.
[01:44:26.952 --> 01:44:27.832]  Call, turn it on.
[01:44:29.213 --> 01:44:33.974]  And now the only debt I have is two cars and my house.
[01:44:35.175 --> 01:44:37.876]  And that's still a lot of debt.
[01:44:38.596 --> 01:44:42.838]  But compared to a lot of people, I mean, they're going into debt for big plasma screen TVs.
[01:44:42.858 --> 01:44:44.718]  You know, I've got like an eight-year-old TV.
[01:44:45.038 --> 01:44:46.979]  They're going into debt for new furniture.
[01:44:47.019 --> 01:44:49.920]  I've got about seven-year-old furniture.
[01:44:50.781 --> 01:44:52.861]  You know, just cheap stuff from the room store.
[01:44:53.121 --> 01:44:54.402]  Because I don't care about that stuff.
[01:44:55.545 --> 01:44:57.706]  I don't know.
[01:44:57.827 --> 01:44:59.768]  It's just really simple.
[01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:03.850]  All right, I'm perseverating.
[01:45:03.870 --> 01:45:06.092]  Let's go on to Lynn in Oklahoma.
[01:45:06.392 --> 01:45:07.172]  Lynn, go ahead.
[01:45:08.493 --> 01:45:09.213]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[01:45:09.534 --> 01:45:09.834]  Hi.
[01:45:10.034 --> 01:45:11.115]  Good to talk to you today.
[01:45:11.975 --> 01:45:14.457]  I just wanted to say what a great job you did last week.
[01:45:14.537 --> 01:45:15.777]  I haven't had a chance to call in.
[01:45:15.877 --> 01:45:18.219]  I just wanted to say great job on the coast last Thursday.
[01:45:18.299 --> 01:45:19.139]  Oh, coast to coast.
[01:45:19.260 --> 01:45:19.860]  Absolutely.
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:23.102]  Yeah, you and Mr. Griffin won that hands down.
[01:45:23.988 --> 01:45:26.871]  And I just wanted to also thank George Norrie for having you on.
[01:45:27.451 --> 01:45:29.073]  You know, I agree with something you said.
[01:45:29.113 --> 01:45:37.681]  I guess it was two or three days ago you had made the comment that you were pretty certain that Mr. Norrie knows what's going on, and I tend to agree with that.
[01:45:37.721 --> 01:45:40.163]  Well, I'm more than pretty certain.
[01:45:40.663 --> 01:45:42.825]  I've been in studio with him for four hours.
[01:45:43.186 --> 01:45:43.406]  Right.
[01:45:43.706 --> 01:45:44.827]  Okay.
[01:45:44.847 --> 01:45:46.489]  Well, that's about all I have.
[01:45:46.509 --> 01:45:47.610]  I just wanted to say great job.
[01:45:48.317 --> 01:45:50.278]  Well, I appreciate the call.
[01:45:50.598 --> 01:45:50.958]  Thank you.
[01:45:51.698 --> 01:45:55.860]  George Norrie is in such a powerful position that he has to be very careful.
[01:45:56.980 --> 01:46:00.422]  But George does a show.
[01:46:00.882 --> 01:46:04.003]  A lot of it is about entertainment and interesting things and strange things.
[01:46:04.043 --> 01:46:04.943]  That's very popular.
[01:46:04.983 --> 01:46:05.704]  He does a lot of that.
[01:46:06.244 --> 01:46:12.226]  But he has taken the program in a massive new direction and in a good direction.
[01:46:13.534 --> 01:46:22.656]  I mean, you know, whereas in the past you might hear one guest about the New World Order out of maybe 20 people, 20 guests, now it's like one guest out of three.
[01:46:24.076 --> 01:46:26.117]  And, man, I mean, I just can't complain about that.
[01:46:26.597 --> 01:46:27.697]  I mean, how do I complain?
[01:46:27.737 --> 01:46:30.537]  People complain, you know, Alex is on coast to coast.
[01:46:31.118 --> 01:46:31.758]  That's evil.
[01:46:32.018 --> 01:46:32.638]  How dare him?
[01:46:33.178 --> 01:46:35.498]  Folks, I mean, they don't tell me what I can or can't say.
[01:46:36.439 --> 01:46:37.579]  They did check me out, though.
[01:46:37.599 --> 01:46:40.599]  They made sure that, you know, I document what I say.
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:43.100]  I prove what, you know, I demonstrate what I talk about
[01:46:43.897 --> 01:46:46.419]  You know, George will say, what's your documentation on that?
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.501]  You know, when I'm talking about something, and I appreciate that.
[01:46:49.841 --> 01:46:52.563]  And I post what I'm going to talk about up on the website every time I go on.
[01:46:52.944 --> 01:46:55.225]  But they've never told me what to say, what I can do.
[01:46:55.245 --> 01:46:57.327]  I mean, that's amazing.
[01:46:59.068 --> 01:47:01.430]  Before I went on Good Morning America, they did.
[01:47:02.330 --> 01:47:05.233]  And, of course, I said whatever I wanted to, and they cut the interview a little bit short.
[01:47:05.913 --> 01:47:11.197]  But, I mean, how can I complain about going on 500 and something radio stations and saying whatever I want?
[01:47:12.499 --> 01:47:14.200]  That is just positive.
[01:47:14.220 --> 01:47:17.161]  There's no other way to cut it or slice it.
[01:47:17.401 --> 01:47:19.542]  George's show is exploding in popularity.
[01:47:21.043 --> 01:47:28.987]  He's really building the show back up before he came along, before it had some declines because of people being out and stuff.
[01:47:31.008 --> 01:47:31.968]  I can only commend him.
[01:47:32.008 --> 01:47:34.089]  Let's encourage him in the direction he's going.
[01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:38.951]  Not be a bunch of peckerwoods and jump on him for not doing everything the way we want him to.
[01:47:39.972 --> 01:47:40.512]  Alright, let's...
[01:47:42.162 --> 01:48:01.754]  Tell you what, I'm going to hold off on calls, because now again what happened is with our guests, they got their time zones scrambled, and so Michael Cristofaro is coming on in about ten minutes, and so is William Von Winkle, and they're in a couple of different AP articles and other local articles saying that they're not giving their property up.
[01:48:01.794 --> 01:48:02.314]  They don't care.
[01:48:02.354 --> 01:48:02.975]  They're staying.
[01:48:03.635 --> 01:48:05.216]  They don't care what these crooks are doing.
[01:48:05.988 --> 01:48:08.409]  And so I just can't wait to have these individuals on.
[01:48:08.449 --> 01:48:10.490]  But what I'm going to do is I'm going to come back after this break.
[01:48:10.510 --> 01:48:11.871]  Like, I'm going to do it right now.
[01:48:11.891 --> 01:48:12.771]  We've got a minute or two.
[01:48:12.791 --> 01:48:15.072]  A minute and a half to be exact.
[01:48:15.633 --> 01:48:17.073]  And go over some more of this news.
[01:48:18.714 --> 01:48:29.099]  We have a former Assistant Secretary of Treasury under Reagan doubts official 9-11 story claims neocon agenda is as insane as Hitler and Nazi Party when they invaded Russia in the dead of winter.
[01:48:29.659 --> 01:48:35.002]  A former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Reagan stepped back into the political spotlight this week
[01:48:35.623 --> 01:48:37.364]  Well, he's been in the political spotlight.
[01:48:38.604 --> 01:48:51.029]  Szymanski, I mean, he writes articles expressing doubt about the official 9-11 story and claiming if they lied to us about Ruby Ridge, Waco, and weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, why should we believe them now?
[01:48:51.610 --> 01:48:52.570]  Paul Craig Roberts...
[01:48:53.625 --> 01:49:04.310]  Listed by Who's Who of America as one of the top 1,000 most influential political thinkers in the world, has evolved over the years into a major Bush basher, as well as a neocon critic.
[01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:15.655]  Roberts said he hasn't changed his political ideology or jumped from the Republican-Conservative ship, but just can't respect the party leadership who doesn't respect the truth, and who are out-Clintoning Clinton, I would add.
[01:49:16.295 --> 01:49:17.536]  I'm in the same boat, folks.
[01:49:18.376 --> 01:49:37.508]  He is another in a long list of Republican faithful, including top-ranking government and military officials, who have left or been pushed out of Washington since Bush's neocon followers continue demonstrating a lack of desire and patience to compromise, even with conservatives refusing to tow the neocon line.
[01:49:39.258 --> 01:49:51.747]  And he went on to express doubt about the government's official version of 9-11, but deferring detailed criticism to the experts, Roberts' concerns come on the heels of recent criticism leveled by Morgan Reynolds, a former chief economist in Bush's first administration.
[01:49:52.187 --> 01:49:52.888]  Stay with us!
[01:49:57.020 --> 01:49:59.881]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:50:00.121 --> 01:50:01.702]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:02.062 --> 01:50:06.724]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:07.064 --> 01:50:11.506]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:50:11.926 --> 01:50:16.088]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:16.328 --> 01:50:19.169]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:19.249 --> 01:50:23.911]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:24.111 --> 01:50:28.493]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:28.753 --> 01:50:35.956]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:36.236 --> 01:50:38.657]  Discover the documentary truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:51:56.816 --> 01:51:58.398]  You've heard it over and over again.
[01:51:58.638 --> 01:52:01.120]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[01:52:01.460 --> 01:52:05.123]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[01:52:05.424 --> 01:52:10.268]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[01:52:10.608 --> 01:52:11.309]  Don't wait for when.

[01:52:49.913 --> 01:52:53.536]  It's better to be a year too early than a day too late.
[01:52:56.538 --> 01:52:59.320]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:59.340 --> 01:53:03.223]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:09.328 --> 01:53:10.269]  Senator Hagel...
[01:53:12.848 --> 01:53:15.329]  Says the United States is losing the Iraq War.
[01:53:15.669 --> 01:53:18.189]  Well, let's look at that statement in context.
[01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:33.332]  We have a private corrupt corporation, the District of Columbia and its allied crime syndicates, that have seized control of our government and are feeding our men and women into a meat grinder of radiation.
[01:53:35.153 --> 01:53:36.333]  And that's not going well.
[01:53:36.373 --> 01:53:36.873]  The U.S.
[01:53:36.933 --> 01:53:37.873]  isn't losing anything.
[01:53:38.913 --> 01:53:39.373]  The U.S.
[01:53:39.434 --> 01:53:41.694]  is just a step closer of getting out of a quagmire.
[01:53:44.159 --> 01:53:48.183]  Congress is mulling support for Saddam's terrorist Mujahideen.
[01:53:50.545 --> 01:53:54.788]  They've used them to destabilize Iraq with bombings, and now they'll do the same in Iran.
[01:53:54.808 --> 01:53:56.790]  And that's come out.
[01:53:57.310 --> 01:54:01.094]  Congress has been examining the prospect of granting U.S.
[01:54:01.114 --> 01:54:05.978]  support to an Iranian opposition group on the State Department's terrorist list.
[01:54:06.590 --> 01:54:17.978]  Congressional sources said several key House and Senate members have been discussing the removal of the Mujahideen, or MEK, from the State Department's list of terrorist groups.
[01:54:19.259 --> 01:54:21.741]  This classic New World Order activity.
[01:54:22.541 --> 01:54:23.482]  Hagel says the U.S.
[01:54:23.542 --> 01:54:30.787]  is losing the war, back to that article, in demonstrating and demoralizing comments that have drawn surprising little fire
[01:54:31.488 --> 01:54:33.050]  From his fellow Republicans.
[01:54:33.150 --> 01:54:35.133]  Oh look, Newsmax is very upset about this.
[01:54:35.754 --> 01:54:40.000]  Senator Chuck Hagel, who's a Bilderberger by the way, is claiming that the U.S.
[01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.923]  is actually losing the war in Iraq.
[01:54:42.103 --> 01:54:42.664]  Really?
[01:54:43.755 --> 01:54:45.697]  The reality is that we're losing in Iraq.
[01:54:45.717 --> 01:54:46.617]  Hagel told U.S.
[01:54:46.657 --> 01:54:51.041]  News & World Report earlier this week, things aren't getting better, they're getting worse.
[01:54:51.501 --> 01:54:53.503]  Well, yeah, the numbers of dead, everything's getting worse.
[01:54:54.003 --> 01:55:05.453]  The Nebraska Republican blaming the Bush administration, saying a more positive assessment of Vice President Dick Cheney's earlier in the month showed that the White House is completely disconnected from reality.
[01:55:05.873 --> 01:55:09.736]  Well, no, the White House says they make reality, which, yeah, they're totally delusional.
[01:55:10.276 --> 01:55:12.778]  It's like they're just making it up as they go along.
[01:55:12.919 --> 01:55:13.279]  Oh, really?
[01:55:14.508 --> 01:55:24.097]  Hagel added, if things don't start to turn around in the next six months, then it may be too late predicting that Congress should urge President Bush to cut and run at that point.
[01:55:24.937 --> 01:55:29.161]  The top Republicans' comments have been quoted in two reports on Al Jazeera since Monday.
[01:55:29.662 --> 01:55:40.772]  Hagel's remarks, however, should come as news to al-Qaeda Iraqi operations chief Abu Masab al-Zawahiri, who is now admittedly CIA, who has completely...
[01:55:41.691 --> 01:55:43.931]  And repeatedly in recent months that the U.S.
[01:55:43.971 --> 01:55:46.332]  has his forces on the ropes.
[01:55:47.212 --> 01:55:47.412]  Ha!
[01:55:48.092 --> 01:55:48.672]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55:48.852 --> 01:55:52.493]  I mean, you've got us on the ropes, Al-Qaeda says.
[01:55:52.513 --> 01:56:00.174]  I remember Saddam's going on TV, I don't work with Al-Qaeda, I attack Al-Qaeda, I hate them, you fund them, the destabilized countries.
[01:56:00.534 --> 01:56:02.495]  No, that's on the record, I fight them.
[01:56:03.255 --> 01:56:07.115]  Then suddenly Bin Laden releases a statement, No, I'm with Saddam, I work with him.
[01:56:07.735 --> 01:56:08.816]  Yes, yes, it's true.
[01:56:08.856 --> 01:56:10.276]  I mean, just what... It's like...
[01:56:11.448 --> 01:56:25.322]  On the eve of war, we had Secretary of State, former Secretary of State, at the time Secretary of State, Powell, up in front of the Senate, and he's going, well, there's a new tape on Al Jazeera airing right now where bin Laden says he works for Saddam.
[01:56:26.162 --> 01:56:32.869]  And staffers all run out of the office and they make phone calls and the news breaks in and it's going, well, there's actually no report.
[01:56:33.641 --> 01:56:38.263]  And then they come and whisper in his ear, and he goes, Oh, I'm told it'll be on within the next few hours.
[01:56:39.004 --> 01:56:40.444]  Ah, yes, the bin Laden tape.
[01:56:40.785 --> 01:56:41.905]  Agreeing with him.
[01:56:42.305 --> 01:56:44.346]  See, Al-Qaeda agrees with me.
[01:56:44.366 --> 01:56:46.867]  They don't work for us, though, no.
[01:56:48.068 --> 01:57:00.214]  Even though it's admitted we created them and funded them and used them against the Serbs and against Gaddafi and against the Russians and against everyone else until the late 1990s, even though we fly them out to safety, we're not with them.
[01:57:00.554 --> 01:57:02.115]  They just do everything we want them to.
[01:57:04.073 --> 01:57:06.034]  It's so transparent.
[01:57:07.976 --> 01:57:16.501]  So now the supposed leader of Al-Qaeda, the number two man who's been killed four times, captured four or five times, injured five or six times, why, he says, yes, we're losing.
[01:57:17.201 --> 01:57:18.462]  The Americans are winning.
[01:57:18.502 --> 01:57:20.523]  It's as if he was really an enemy.
[01:57:20.563 --> 01:57:22.044]  He'd say that even if it was true.
[01:57:22.725 --> 01:57:25.967]  It's just, a two-year-old could figure this out.
[01:57:26.427 --> 01:57:32.471]  Third hour, your calls, a massive news we haven't even gotten to yet, and some of these homeowners facing demolition.
[01:57:35.520 --> 01:57:36.000]  Big Brother.
[01:57:36.020 --> 01:57:36.581]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:55.063 --> 01:57:55.884]  We're good to go.
[01:57:55.904 --> 01:57:57.225]  We're good to go.
[01:58:17.802 --> 01:58:31.327]  This is the quote out of a local newspaper by William Von Winkle who owns three buildings on what remains of Smith Street up in Connecticut where they're saying they can take property for absolutely no reason.
[01:58:32.488 --> 01:58:33.528]  I'm not going anywhere.
[01:58:33.668 --> 01:58:34.148]  I'm here.
[01:58:35.769 --> 01:58:37.790]  I'm going to fight until they give up.
[01:58:37.870 --> 01:58:44.012]  They can do their little development around here with us here or they can do no development and try to take it.
[01:58:44.580 --> 01:58:50.925]  Because until they stop trying to take my property by eminent domain, they are not going to build anything at Fort Turnbull.
[01:58:51.486 --> 01:58:52.366]  It's simple as that.
[01:58:53.027 --> 01:58:55.829]  And we've got him and others coming up a little bit later.
[01:58:57.010 --> 01:59:04.917]  But Michael Cristofaro and his family, they own several properties, and they're just sick of it.
[01:59:04.957 --> 01:59:06.638]  They're just leaving that area.
[01:59:06.678 --> 01:59:08.840]  The problem is this is going to happen now nationwide.
[01:59:09.420 --> 01:59:11.182]  Drive by Michael Cristofaro's home.
[01:59:12.418 --> 01:59:16.602]  At 50 Denison Avenue tomorrow, he promises, you'll see the sign for sale.
[01:59:17.022 --> 01:59:17.583]  I'm out of here.
[01:59:17.603 --> 01:59:21.927]  I'm selling my home, Christopher, a new London resident for 43 years, said Thursday.
[01:59:22.347 --> 01:59:24.189]  I'm a white-collar worker, computer engineer.
[01:59:24.849 --> 01:59:26.331]  Who do they want living in this town?
[01:59:26.491 --> 01:59:31.735]  The Christopher family owns a second home at 53 Goshen Street in the Fort Tumble neighborhood.
[01:59:32.136 --> 01:59:33.017]  On Thursday, the U.S.
[01:59:33.037 --> 01:59:36.600]  Supreme Court affirmed the city's right to take that home, and homes...
[01:59:37.552 --> 01:59:39.695]  Of other property owners by eminent domain.
[01:59:39.935 --> 01:59:43.880]  The decision came as no surprise to those fighting to save their homes.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:47.184]  And it's not for a bridge or a road.
[01:59:47.404 --> 01:59:54.593]  It is simply if developers can show that they'll build a building that'll have more property tax than you have no property rights...
[01:59:55.245 --> 01:59:58.167]  Mr. Cristofaro, Mike, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:59:58.607 --> 01:59:59.348]  Thank you very much.
[01:59:59.368 --> 02:00:00.228]  I'm proud to be here.
[02:00:00.648 --> 02:00:01.729]  We've got a break in a second.
[02:00:01.769 --> 02:00:02.910]  We'll come back with a long segment.
[02:00:02.930 --> 02:00:03.991]  We have plenty of time to talk.
[02:00:04.051 --> 02:00:07.913]  But this fight's been going on for a while, and it's gotten national attention.
[02:00:08.513 --> 02:00:09.734]  Tell us why you're upset about it.
[02:00:10.254 --> 02:00:13.597]  Well, you've got to understand, my family has lived in New London for the last 42 years.
[02:00:14.850 --> 02:00:18.412]  And 35 years ago, the city of New London took our first home by eminent domain.
[02:00:19.052 --> 02:00:26.336]  And they purchased this home on Goshen Street, 53 Goshen, back in 1971 after they lost their first house.
[02:00:26.996 --> 02:00:31.319]  And the city came back and took it again, I mean, for the same reason.
[02:00:31.899 --> 02:00:39.023]  Our first home was torn down and there's an office complex sitting right where the property used to be.
[02:00:39.850 --> 02:00:40.951]  So we're sick and tired of this.
[02:00:41.231 --> 02:00:45.934]  Developers should not take your property so that they could make their money and everything else off of your sweat and equity.
[02:00:46.295 --> 02:00:47.516]  These are our properties.
[02:00:47.836 --> 02:00:50.718]  We have the right to live in them, and we should be able to stay in them.
[02:00:52.159 --> 02:00:58.283]  Now, for a long time, they've gone into vibrant, working-class neighborhoods and destroyed everything.
[02:00:58.784 --> 02:01:00.725]  But now they're going into middle-class neighborhoods.
[02:01:01.309 --> 02:01:13.187]  Uh, areas, and I've been telling folks, this has been going on for a while, stealing people's property when it's not even eminent domain, you know, for some bridge or something, but now that we've got a Supreme Court ruling backing these criminals up.
[02:01:15.053 --> 02:01:15.894]  You're absolutely right.
[02:01:16.074 --> 02:01:17.875]  And the thing is, no one is safe.
[02:01:18.156 --> 02:01:22.599]  I mean, it doesn't make a difference if you're poor, you're middle class, you're upper class.
[02:01:22.879 --> 02:01:24.040]  It does not make a difference.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:38.270]  The rule and the way it came down is if somebody wants your property, and if they could generate more tax dollars than you can, if they want to put up a Target or Home Depot, Lowe's, or whatever you have, the municipality can come to you and kick you out of your property and take it.
[02:01:40.212 --> 02:01:41.933]  Well, then you really don't own that property.
[02:01:42.521 --> 02:01:44.683]  We haven't even owned our property for the last five years.
[02:01:44.723 --> 02:01:52.768]  The city gave my mom and dad a condemnation notice November 22nd, the day before Thanksgiving in the year 2000.
[02:01:54.739 --> 02:01:56.239]  We don't even owe title to the property.
[02:01:56.439 --> 02:02:01.540]  Now, I've also read that they're not even trying to give people the value of the home by these condemnation notices.
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:03.001]  It's just in the value of the lot.
[02:02:03.941 --> 02:02:05.321]  That's basically true.
[02:02:05.521 --> 02:02:06.561]  Oh, unbelievable.
[02:02:06.721 --> 02:02:12.602]  The original offer was $60,000 for a 10-room home with a half-acre of land.
[02:02:13.043 --> 02:02:15.383]  And, I mean, the final offer was $150,000, and we're paying taxes on $215,000.
[02:02:15.463 --> 02:02:16.663]  And that's still a value for $2,000.
[02:02:20.624 --> 02:02:22.086]  Where is a family going to go by?
[02:02:22.106 --> 02:02:23.187]  Mike, Mike, stay there.
[02:02:23.307 --> 02:02:23.708]  Stay there.
[02:02:23.788 --> 02:02:29.114]  Folks from New York, California, to Austin, Texas are hearing this right now, to Kansas City, Missouri.
[02:02:29.414 --> 02:02:30.135]  This is coming.
[02:02:30.295 --> 02:02:31.216]  This is happening everywhere.
[02:02:31.296 --> 02:02:31.616]  Stay there.
[02:02:31.637 --> 02:02:32.618]  I want to talk about this.
[02:02:32.658 --> 02:02:32.898]  See?
[02:02:33.659 --> 02:02:37.363]  Again, folks, I've been following this for two years in this particular town.
[02:02:37.763 --> 02:02:39.625]  They don't even give you what your house was worth.
[02:02:39.725 --> 02:02:40.446]  Stay there, sir.
[02:02:41.247 --> 02:02:41.848]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:51.393]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:52.054 --> 02:02:53.355]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:04:54.304 --> 02:04:55.125]  Read the labels.

[02:06:00.271 --> 02:06:04.213]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:04.453 --> 02:06:08.595]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:08.755 --> 02:06:14.037]  The entire Bill of Rights due process is being destroyed.
[02:06:14.077 --> 02:06:15.498]  The borders are wide open.
[02:06:15.518 --> 02:06:17.298]  The Border Patrol is in order to stand down.
[02:06:17.699 --> 02:06:20.480]  Police corruption is at all-time highs.
[02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:27.863]  The Seattle Post-Intelligencer three years ago reported that over half the bars...
[02:06:29.085 --> 02:06:30.967]  In Seattle are owned by police.
[02:06:30.987 --> 02:06:31.687]  Do you know how?
[02:06:32.848 --> 02:06:33.429]  They admitted it.
[02:06:33.469 --> 02:06:37.372]  They will sell each other drugs in your bathroom.
[02:06:37.572 --> 02:06:39.574]  The informant doesn't sell it to somebody else.
[02:06:40.034 --> 02:06:46.259]  They will sell a small amount of drugs in your bathroom to each other and take it and then they give it to cops on the force.
[02:06:46.299 --> 02:06:48.301]  Folks, Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[02:06:50.082 --> 02:06:53.085]  This government is totally out of control.
[02:06:54.424 --> 02:06:55.304]  Across the board.
[02:06:55.844 --> 02:06:57.705]  You all know about the horror stories.
[02:06:57.785 --> 02:07:00.866]  Some cities, some towns, some states are better than others.
[02:07:02.226 --> 02:07:03.806]  But it is bad.
[02:07:04.827 --> 02:07:05.947]  It is really bad.
[02:07:06.987 --> 02:07:15.189]  And people like William Von Winkle says he's going to stay, he's going to fight them, he's not leaving, they're not going to bulldoze his businesses and homes.
[02:07:15.929 --> 02:07:18.770]  Whereas other individuals like Michael Cristofano...
[02:07:20.482 --> 02:07:34.826]  And his two homes there that are going to be bulldozed, his family decades ago had other homes they owned taken, nice middle class homes, by the city for office buildings.
[02:07:35.686 --> 02:07:40.027]  Not for bridges, not for highways, not for hospitals.
[02:07:40.668 --> 02:07:43.348]  No, because some developer wants your land.
[02:07:43.568 --> 02:07:49.650]  And understand, they've been abusing the working class people for a while with, quote, your area's blighted.
[02:07:51.074 --> 02:07:57.756]  Now they're doing it to middle class folks, and this just came up during the last segment with Mr. Cristofano.
[02:07:57.776 --> 02:08:10.400]  Mr. Cristofano, some stations don't carry that first segment, so let's recap your history, what happened, and I brought up that covering this story in the last two years, I noticed that they would condemn the houses...
[02:08:11.204 --> 02:08:25.829]  And then instead of having to pay you $200,000 for your Victorian 10-room home on a half acre, instead of paying you $250,000, lowest value, get a lot more for it, by condemning it, then they just offer you $50,000 for the lot.
[02:08:27.768 --> 02:08:36.295]  Again, and some of these owners bought their houses 10 years ago, haven't even paid the notes off, and then they condemn them, and so you don't even get enough money to pay it off.
[02:08:36.495 --> 02:08:38.797]  Folks, this is total criminality.
[02:08:38.897 --> 02:08:42.219]  So, Michael, Mike, please break this down for us.
[02:08:43.420 --> 02:08:47.764]  Well, you've got to understand, when they approached us, they really low-balled the price.
[02:08:47.864 --> 02:08:50.206]  I mean, it was $60,000 for this piece of property.
[02:08:50.586 --> 02:08:53.008]  And it's like, where is, you know, a middle-class...
[02:08:54.204 --> 02:08:58.667]  You are even a low-income person supposed to move out of their homes and find another place to live.
[02:08:58.868 --> 02:09:00.189]  Well, this is waterfront, too.
[02:09:00.449 --> 02:09:01.069]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:09:01.129 --> 02:09:03.151]  I mean, we're about 200, 300 feet from the waterfront.
[02:09:03.191 --> 02:09:06.113]  And you're a white-collar computer programmer.
[02:09:06.453 --> 02:09:08.014]  Yes, I'm a computer engineer.
[02:09:08.194 --> 02:09:08.634]  Engineer.
[02:09:09.235 --> 02:09:10.255]  Yes.
[02:09:10.616 --> 02:09:12.037]  I mean, I'm a white-collar worker.
[02:09:12.097 --> 02:09:13.618]  I make decent money.
[02:09:14.018 --> 02:09:16.740]  But these are beautiful homes with history.
[02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:18.381]  I mean, I've seen photos of them.
[02:09:19.248 --> 02:09:19.889]  You're absolutely right.
[02:09:19.929 --> 02:09:21.189]  They're over 100 years old.
[02:09:22.050 --> 02:09:25.672]  And the thing is, they would fit perfect in this type of redevelopment.
[02:09:25.712 --> 02:09:30.735]  I mean, why can't you make... Houses like that in Georgetown go for $2 million.
[02:09:30.775 --> 02:09:32.076]  Yes, you're absolutely right.
[02:09:34.418 --> 02:09:36.159]  But the thing is, it's not even about the money.
[02:09:36.259 --> 02:09:39.441]  It's just about your home, about you wanting to remain in your home.
[02:09:39.721 --> 02:09:42.342]  I mean, we have families there that have been there for over 100 years.
[02:09:43.023 --> 02:09:46.305]  I mean, how can you take people out of their homes that they've been there since 1895?
[02:09:48.484 --> 02:09:54.628]  Well, I tell you, on our family farmstead in East Texas, you can feel the history in the dirt.
[02:09:54.648 --> 02:09:59.732]  You know, we've been there since 1829, and you can just feel the history there.
[02:10:00.492 --> 02:10:03.074]  And can you imagine them telling these people to get out?
[02:10:03.595 --> 02:10:11.200]  That we want your farmland or whatever so that we could build an office complex, a biotech building, a fitness club?
[02:10:12.434 --> 02:10:20.459]  And what the real flapper is, they're going to put residential homes back into this neighborhood, but yet they don't want us living in this neighborhood.
[02:10:21.800 --> 02:10:24.181]  Now, again, before the break you were saying $50,000.
[02:10:24.241 --> 02:10:27.063]  Is it $50,000 or $60,000 they first offered after they condemned the house?
[02:10:28.603 --> 02:10:28.804]  It was $60,000.
[02:10:30.337 --> 02:10:34.241]  Okay, I'm sorry, your phone was cutting out, so I thought you said $50,000.
[02:10:34.281 --> 02:10:36.883]  So $60,000, but what are you paying on property tax?
[02:10:37.043 --> 02:10:38.544]  What are they valuing your home for?
[02:10:38.784 --> 02:10:47.692]  They're valuing the property at $215,000, and their final offer to get it out was $150,000, so it was only 70% of the value.
[02:10:47.912 --> 02:10:49.273]  And so your home is paid for?
[02:10:49.794 --> 02:10:51.235]  Right, and the home has been paid for.
[02:10:51.455 --> 02:10:52.576]  Now, let's go back, though.
[02:10:52.616 --> 02:10:54.758]  How many decades ago did they steal your first house?
[02:10:55.819 --> 02:10:57.400]  They did that back in 1971.
[02:10:59.466 --> 02:11:03.847]  We purchased this house after the first eminent domain proceedings.
[02:11:05.908 --> 02:11:08.949]  So your city council is old hat at this.
[02:11:09.289 --> 02:11:11.830]  Oh, you hit that right on the nose.
[02:11:12.190 --> 02:11:13.870]  They love using that eminent domain power.
[02:11:14.110 --> 02:11:18.572]  The sad part was they didn't even have the guts to use the eminent domain against us.
[02:11:18.612 --> 02:11:24.293]  They gave the power to a private entity called the New London Development Corporation who used the power.
[02:11:24.333 --> 02:11:26.234]  Yeah, these regional boards do it, yeah.
[02:11:26.494 --> 02:11:26.694]  Right.
[02:11:27.765 --> 02:11:30.586]  They didn't have the guts to come out to us and do it themselves.
[02:11:32.106 --> 02:11:35.607]  How about special elections removing the people on the council?
[02:11:35.927 --> 02:11:36.828]  Well, we did.
[02:11:37.028 --> 02:11:42.369]  On our last elections, we voted out four of the six council members.
[02:11:42.409 --> 02:11:44.870]  And let me guess, they all got jobs on the real estate council.
[02:11:45.350 --> 02:11:46.130]  Yeah, pretty much.
[02:11:46.410 --> 02:11:49.671]  I mean, the next day that they were voted in, they came back.
[02:11:50.211 --> 02:11:55.753]  Before they were voted, they were stating that they were against the eminent domain, they were going to put a stop to it.
[02:11:56.624 --> 02:11:56.744]  Sure.
[02:11:56.784 --> 02:11:56.944]  Sure.
[02:12:16.218 --> 02:12:17.779]  No, go ahead, sorry.
[02:12:17.799 --> 02:12:18.859]  We need to get the laws changed.
[02:12:18.879 --> 02:12:23.240]  We need to get our legislation, our Congress, to turn around and protect property owners.
[02:12:23.761 --> 02:12:24.681]  The U.S.
[02:12:24.721 --> 02:12:32.624]  Supreme Court, with that 5-4 decision, they basically erased what our forefathers wanted in the Constitution.
[02:12:32.684 --> 02:12:33.944]  Well, listen, if they want...
[02:12:35.323 --> 02:12:42.990]  If they want to put a Walmart there, and Walmart, by the way, comes in and says, we'll build right on the city line if you don't give us that piece of property we want.
[02:12:43.050 --> 02:12:45.312]  Boy, here comes the city after your land.
[02:12:45.672 --> 02:12:54.800]  Or if they want to put that Target there, or they want to put those homes there, in your case, this is a free market country, then let them pay what it'll take to get you out.
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:57.222]  I mean, I imagine if they offered you a million bucks, you might do it.
[02:12:57.543 --> 02:12:58.263]  Well, you know what?
[02:12:58.724 --> 02:13:00.085]  If it was a free enterprise...
[02:13:00.905 --> 02:13:02.066]  I would probably take the offer.
[02:13:02.086 --> 02:13:06.048]  But what they did, they approached us, they intimidated us, they harassed us.
[02:13:06.268 --> 02:13:07.148]  Oh, tell me about it.
[02:13:07.308 --> 02:13:09.850]  You know, they didn't treat anybody with any dignity.
[02:13:09.930 --> 02:13:10.870]  Well, give us details.
[02:13:10.930 --> 02:13:11.591]  Tell us what they did.
[02:13:11.991 --> 02:13:20.075]  Oh, they would show up at my parents' homes on Sunday dinner with contracts in hand, tell them that they don't have a choice in the matter.
[02:13:20.355 --> 02:13:23.276]  You need to sign this contract now or you're going to get less money.
[02:13:24.717 --> 02:13:27.038]  My parents were, you know, in their late 70s.
[02:13:27.078 --> 02:13:28.759]  They would call them at all hours of the day.
[02:13:29.542 --> 02:13:31.583]  ...harassing them, intimidation.
[02:13:31.903 --> 02:13:35.906]  They would have the bulldozers pointing at the house, saying, your house is next.
[02:13:36.606 --> 02:13:38.187]  Sir, that is terroristic threats.
[02:13:38.207 --> 02:13:43.250]  You mean they would bring bulldozers to say, we're going to tear it down, sign the contract?
[02:13:43.490 --> 02:13:44.730]  Yeah.
[02:13:44.750 --> 02:13:45.571]  You've got to sue them.
[02:13:45.731 --> 02:13:47.192]  Sir, that is terroristic threats.
[02:13:47.652 --> 02:13:48.893]  That is official oppression.
[02:13:49.593 --> 02:13:49.993]  That's a whole...
[02:13:51.696 --> 02:13:52.777]  That is unbelievable.
[02:13:52.897 --> 02:13:53.558]  I didn't know that.
[02:13:53.618 --> 02:13:55.019]  Oh, I've got to write an article about this.
[02:13:55.240 --> 02:13:56.181]  When did this happen?
[02:13:56.541 --> 02:13:59.324]  And a lot of these elderly people, they didn't have a choice.
[02:13:59.384 --> 02:14:02.027]  They ended up signing on the contract, and they moved.
[02:14:02.267 --> 02:14:07.652]  And what the city didn't realize was they were getting people like myself that are in their 40s, between the 40s and 55s,
[02:14:09.193 --> 02:14:09.653]  You know what?
[02:14:09.973 --> 02:14:10.593]  This is wrong.
[02:14:10.653 --> 02:14:12.314]  We're going to stand back here and fight.
[02:14:12.474 --> 02:14:14.574]  Mr. Cristofaro, let's be specific.
[02:14:14.774 --> 02:14:15.574]  This is unbelievable.
[02:14:15.794 --> 02:14:17.855]  You see, notice the national media hadn't told us this.
[02:14:18.095 --> 02:14:19.615]  It's always worse every time.
[02:14:19.655 --> 02:14:20.635]  It's worse than what we were told.
[02:14:21.135 --> 02:14:22.076]  That's actually possible.
[02:14:22.116 --> 02:14:23.136]  It's many times worse.
[02:14:23.556 --> 02:14:24.336]  This is hellish.
[02:14:24.676 --> 02:14:31.197]  You're telling me they would do the classic thing of the bulldozers, and if they, again, folks, didn't need the contract, they'd have already gone with the bulldozers.
[02:14:31.537 --> 02:14:34.718]  It's in court, and they've got bulldozers pointed at the house.
[02:14:34.998 --> 02:14:37.941]  With 70-year-old people telling him to sign the contract.
[02:14:38.041 --> 02:14:40.883]  Give me the specifics.
[02:14:41.224 --> 02:14:42.145]  Sign the contract.
[02:14:42.665 --> 02:14:47.329]  You're not even going to get what we're offering you, and we're just going to throw you out because we're going to use them in a domain.
[02:14:47.509 --> 02:14:48.690]  With bulldozers?
[02:14:49.511 --> 02:14:51.373]  With bulldozers, a wrecking ball.
[02:14:52.254 --> 02:14:54.476]  Were the bulldozers revving their engines?
[02:14:55.276 --> 02:15:00.241]  Well, you know, sometimes early in the morning they would be in there, you know, revving them up like they were warming them up.
[02:15:01.178 --> 02:15:04.440]  Well, the reason I know about this is in other cases with farmers and people.
[02:15:04.980 --> 02:15:05.980]  I'm going to tell you something, sir.
[02:15:06.180 --> 02:15:14.824]  I saw a video that I was not allowed to show on TV by a construction crew at a base in San Antonio with Marines five years ago.
[02:15:15.484 --> 02:15:17.465]  And they had bulldozers revving them up.
[02:15:17.585 --> 02:15:21.647]  It was Marines and role players with signs saying, This is America.
[02:15:21.927 --> 02:15:23.288]  You can't have our farm.
[02:15:23.628 --> 02:15:25.269]  And it was how to intimidate people.
[02:15:26.388 --> 02:15:30.594]  Well, they must have a book out on it because they're basically using the same kind of time.
[02:15:30.614 --> 02:15:32.356]  I just said revving engines and see.
[02:15:32.376 --> 02:15:32.456]  Yeah.
[02:15:33.678 --> 02:15:35.340]  Imagine old people with engines.
[02:15:37.122 --> 02:15:37.903]  Sign it.
[02:15:37.943 --> 02:15:39.746]  Black smoke coming out of the smokestack.
[02:15:39.806 --> 02:15:40.587]  Good Lord.
[02:15:40.607 --> 02:15:41.468]  You know?
[02:15:41.608 --> 02:15:43.791]  I mean, how can these people tolerate that?
[02:15:44.284 --> 02:15:51.751]  You know, when they served my mom with a condemnation notice the day before Thanksgiving, we had to bring her to the emergency room because she was having a mild heart attack.
[02:15:51.791 --> 02:15:55.013]  Look, my grandfather had a heart attack after they did this to him, okay?
[02:15:55.053 --> 02:15:55.374]  I know.
[02:15:55.394 --> 02:15:58.977]  They told him to clean out some ditch he didn't even own.
[02:15:58.997 --> 02:16:01.039]  And he didn't call me.
[02:16:01.119 --> 02:16:03.641]  He went and did it at 70-something years old and had a heart attack.
[02:16:04.221 --> 02:16:05.142]  Well, I can tell you this.
[02:16:05.222 --> 02:16:06.243]  We're not going anywhere.
[02:16:06.283 --> 02:16:08.065]  We're digging our heels in even deeper.
[02:16:08.536 --> 02:16:08.996]  That's right.
[02:16:09.036 --> 02:16:12.358]  Hundreds of others were intimidated into capitulating.
[02:16:12.378 --> 02:16:15.380]  Were other homes, were other people intimidated with bulldozers?
[02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:15.840]  Yes, they were.
[02:16:32.341 --> 02:16:33.882]  Well, that's terrorism.
[02:16:33.922 --> 02:16:43.426]  I went to somebody's house with a bulldozer, started revving it up, and I'm a private individual, even government it's illegal, walked up and said, sign, I'm going to bulldoze, when they had no authority to bulldoze.
[02:16:44.146 --> 02:16:46.727]  That is, sir, they're not going to jail?
[02:16:47.727 --> 02:16:50.629]  We had an elderly man that lived in his house for 80 years.
[02:16:50.689 --> 02:16:52.289]  He was 93 when he passed away.
[02:16:52.949 --> 02:16:56.791]  On his deathbed, his last words were, what about my house?
[02:16:57.211 --> 02:16:59.032]  I mean, can you imagine what that family went through?
[02:17:00.286 --> 02:17:07.733]  I mean, the stress alone for that poor man on his last days, and he was more concerned about his house.
[02:17:07.973 --> 02:17:13.177]  Now, was this the Development Corporation, the regional body of representing the land barons?
[02:17:13.217 --> 02:17:15.699]  Was that who was revving up the gas, the bulldozers?
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:16.080]  Oh, yeah.
[02:17:16.120 --> 02:17:17.341]  I mean, yeah, exactly.
[02:17:17.361 --> 02:17:18.462]  I mean, they hired the contractor.
[02:17:18.482 --> 02:17:19.283]  They told them what to do.
[02:17:19.603 --> 02:17:21.605]  How does this contractor live with himself?
[02:17:22.145 --> 02:17:22.786]  I wish I knew.
[02:17:22.986 --> 02:17:26.569]  Boy, they better hope that guy never, I hope I never, man, I'll tell you what.
[02:17:27.492 --> 02:17:28.732]  Intimidating old people.
[02:17:28.772 --> 02:17:33.353]  You know, the Bible says, folks, that is the ultimate sin is abusing the weak.
[02:17:34.014 --> 02:17:38.055]  And let me tell you something, boy, and you just, I am boiling right now.
[02:17:38.775 --> 02:17:39.515]  I am boiling.
[02:17:39.795 --> 02:17:41.075]  Sir, can you do one more segment with us?
[02:17:41.615 --> 02:17:41.855]  Sure.
[02:17:42.135 --> 02:17:42.796]  I know you're busy.
[02:17:42.896 --> 02:17:43.256]  Oh, my.
[02:17:43.476 --> 02:17:46.657]  Ladies and gentlemen, it got ten times worse.
[02:17:46.757 --> 02:17:47.797]  It's worse than we knew.
[02:17:48.717 --> 02:17:49.977]  Currency devaluation.
[02:17:50.778 --> 02:17:51.338]  Inflation.
[02:17:51.998 --> 02:17:52.638]  One and the same.
[02:17:54.028 --> 02:17:58.411]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:17:58.431 --> 02:18:00.692]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:18:00.732 --> 02:18:01.573]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:18:01.633 --> 02:18:03.154]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:18:03.214 --> 02:18:03.694]  Here is reality.
[02:18:03.714 --> 02:18:05.635]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:18:23.854 --> 02:18:24.214]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[02:18:47.765 --> 02:18:56.391]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:18:56.612 --> 02:19:07.880]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:19:08.100 --> 02:19:10.722]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:10.922 --> 02:19:11.482]  We're good to go.
[02:19:32.049 --> 02:19:40.535]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:19:44.917 --> 02:19:46.238]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:50.861]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:51.622 --> 02:19:57.225]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[02:19:57.265 --> 02:19:58.006]  Supreme Court.
[02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:03.083]  Yet on February 29th, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[02:20:03.123 --> 02:20:06.745]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[02:20:07.725 --> 02:20:13.008]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[02:20:13.769 --> 02:20:22.073]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:23.634 --> 02:20:25.435]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-NOW.
[02:20:27.039 --> 02:20:27.139]  516-8736.
[02:20:27.179 --> 02:20:27.819]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.859 --> 02:20:28.059]  Call now.
[02:20:28.079 --> 02:20:35.683]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:48.371 --> 02:20:55.253]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:20:55.793 --> 02:21:01.195]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:21:01.615 --> 02:21:11.637]  All-natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:21:11.757 --> 02:21:14.118]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:21:14.498 --> 02:21:17.519]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:21:17.999 --> 02:21:19.159]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:21:19.299 --> 02:21:26.782]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:21:27.042 --> 02:21:28.762]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[02:21:29.122 --> 02:21:40.886]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:21:41.386 --> 02:21:45.707]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:21:52.589 --> 02:21:54.470]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:54.970 --> 02:21:57.792]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.933 --> 02:22:12.419]  Okay, I have read since yesterday morning when the Supreme Court ruled on this swath of Victorian-era-style homes along the waterfront there.
[02:22:12.439 --> 02:22:21.544]  I have read scores of articles, and in the last two years, I have interviewed locals, I have covered it, and I thought I knew everything about it.
[02:22:23.186 --> 02:22:25.927]  I guarantee you the local news media has heard these stories.
[02:22:25.967 --> 02:22:33.630]  The local news media knew about this, and nowhere in the local news media that I've seen or nationally have the details of this been available.
[02:22:34.031 --> 02:22:39.233]  So now after this broadcast, I'm going to get together with Watson and write a big article about this.
[02:22:39.273 --> 02:22:44.575]  I guess it'll have something like, New London Homeowners Viciously Intimidated and Abused News Blackout.
[02:22:45.174 --> 02:22:55.479]  We'll have to get the comments and put it in the article, and I'm going to call a few other of the owners and, of course, double-check all this, though I'm aware of these tactics in other areas.
[02:22:56.700 --> 02:22:59.201]  But, I mean, how could it be worse?
[02:22:59.241 --> 02:23:08.466]  Well, it got a lot worse, and our guests have agreed to stay with us until about 50 after, so if you want to talk to Mike directly about this issue...
[02:23:09.867 --> 02:23:12.888]  Not about the Federal Reserve, not about Iraq.
[02:23:13.109 --> 02:23:14.849]  Let's talk to the guest about this issue.
[02:23:14.889 --> 02:23:15.530]  Next segment, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:23:15.550 --> 02:23:15.770]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:23:15.790 --> 02:23:18.931]  For Mike and his family, who already had one home stolen back in 1971.
[02:23:29.113 --> 02:23:30.554]  Mike, we were talking during the break.
[02:23:30.614 --> 02:23:31.974]  I know it makes your blood boil.
[02:23:32.734 --> 02:23:35.535]  You, unlike some of the other owners, you're just getting out of there.
[02:23:35.696 --> 02:23:37.576]  That's how you're quoted.
[02:23:37.856 --> 02:23:38.857]  Are these accurate quotes?
[02:23:39.077 --> 02:23:39.977]  Oh, they're absolutely.
[02:23:40.017 --> 02:23:47.020]  There's a sign in front of my property today that basically says, for sale, I'm out of here, and thank you, NLDC.
[02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:49.061]  That's the New London Development Corporation.
[02:23:49.581 --> 02:23:52.502]  I've lived here for 42 years of my life, and...
[02:23:53.058 --> 02:23:59.243]  We've lost two houses now, and I think the next wave of eminent domain that this town's going to use is where I'm living today.
[02:23:59.263 --> 02:24:02.785]  So, you know, it's two strikes, you know, you've got me.
[02:24:02.865 --> 02:24:04.166]  The third strike, I'm out of here.
[02:24:04.267 --> 02:24:09.971]  And you're going to be getting massively less than what even the tax rolls say it's worth.
[02:24:10.371 --> 02:24:10.952]  Absolutely.
[02:24:12.293 --> 02:24:12.873]  Absolutely.
[02:24:13.574 --> 02:24:14.214]  I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[02:24:14.274 --> 02:24:15.635]  I don't know where these people are going to go.
[02:24:15.935 --> 02:24:17.957]  Now, if you really want your blood to boil...
[02:24:18.584 --> 02:24:19.845]  How would you like to hear this one?
[02:24:21.226 --> 02:24:26.930]  The City of New London stated that they're going to charge us back rent if we lost this case.
[02:24:27.510 --> 02:24:34.015]  And in some cases, what they're going to charge us for back rent, we'll be paying the City of New London to be kicked out of our own houses.
[02:24:34.135 --> 02:24:35.516]  Again, nowhere in the news.
[02:24:35.596 --> 02:24:41.740]  So what they do is they condemn your property five years, then they charge you monthly for being on their property.
[02:24:42.882 --> 02:24:43.403]  Exactly.
[02:24:43.483 --> 02:24:50.868]  I mean, they haven't submitted the bill yet, but from what I've heard, is that the bill is going to probably exceed what they're going to give us.
[02:24:51.128 --> 02:24:52.469]  How much are they talking about?
[02:24:53.050 --> 02:25:03.798]  Well, the property that they're offering is $150,000, so some people, like Billy Von Winkle's property, they're talking he's going to be owing the city over $200,000 in back rent.
[02:25:05.079 --> 02:25:05.999]  And then you'd be owing $100,000.
[02:25:08.071 --> 02:25:08.751]  If not more.
[02:25:10.132 --> 02:25:11.512]  Again, this is the intimidation.
[02:25:12.773 --> 02:25:14.054]  Reving bulldozers.
[02:25:14.094 --> 02:25:15.755]  We're going to charge you back taxes.
[02:25:15.875 --> 02:25:17.155]  And again, no court is found.
[02:25:17.215 --> 02:25:17.856]  Nothing can happen.
[02:25:18.096 --> 02:25:20.377]  They're just revving bulldozers saying, sign the document.
[02:25:20.537 --> 02:25:21.738]  Did you ever see that movie?
[02:25:21.758 --> 02:25:24.119]  I think it's called The River with Mel Gibson.
[02:25:24.179 --> 02:25:25.940]  It's one of my favorites.
[02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:34.445]  And it's based on a composite of a couple different true stories where they want to take his property, his cornfield, and his house, and he physically stands up against them.
[02:25:34.465 --> 02:25:35.165]  You ever seen that movie?
[02:25:35.345 --> 02:25:35.865]  Yes, I did.
[02:25:38.314 --> 02:25:40.796]  Well, where are the real-life Mel Gibsons?
[02:25:43.518 --> 02:25:48.302]  I tell you, this sounds like the Soviet Union.
[02:25:48.963 --> 02:25:50.104]  You know what?
[02:25:50.204 --> 02:25:54.467]  One of my neighbors over there yesterday, he basically said, you know, welcome to Russia.
[02:25:55.328 --> 02:25:56.349]  I mean, that's what it feels like.
[02:25:56.649 --> 02:25:57.730]  I mean, you have no rights.
[02:25:57.930 --> 02:25:58.711]  I mean, the U.S.
[02:25:58.731 --> 02:26:00.652]  Supreme Court just took away our property rights.
[02:26:01.853 --> 02:26:02.434]  That's what they did.
[02:26:02.893 --> 02:26:07.678]  Well, you know, the Supreme Court in the past, two separate times, said blacks were not human beings.
[02:26:08.178 --> 02:26:10.080]  Now, on the face of it, we know that's ridiculous.
[02:26:10.140 --> 02:26:10.701]  That's right.
[02:26:10.881 --> 02:26:12.503]  So let them say they're God.
[02:26:12.583 --> 02:26:13.344]  They're not God.
[02:26:13.364 --> 02:26:15.466]  Are they your God, Mike?
[02:26:15.806 --> 02:26:16.467]  No, they're not.
[02:26:16.667 --> 02:26:18.569]  You know, the U.S.
[02:26:18.609 --> 02:26:20.631]  Supreme Court is not God, and they're not my God.
[02:26:21.351 --> 02:26:22.772]  Well, this is mafia tactics.
[02:26:22.812 --> 02:26:29.015]  I mean, these corporations come in and pay off city council members, and then they come and steal your land, and then don't even pay you what it's worth.
[02:26:29.135 --> 02:26:29.335]  Yep.
[02:26:29.655 --> 02:26:40.900]  And on top of that, one of the stipulations so that we could stay in our property was that we would have to get the homeowner's insurance and name the city and NLDC as the insured property owners.
[02:26:42.221 --> 02:26:45.703]  Neil Bortz has been championing you guys, and I commend him for it.
[02:26:46.243 --> 02:26:49.024]  Have you told Neil Bortz about the revving bulldozers and threats?
[02:26:49.985 --> 02:26:50.565]  No, I haven't.
[02:26:52.100 --> 02:26:53.622]  No, I haven't.
[02:26:53.662 --> 02:26:58.708]  Now, you talked about 70-plus-year-old people having bulldozers revving and people threatening them to sign the documents.
[02:26:59.389 --> 02:27:01.011]  What about the 92-year-old man?
[02:27:01.071 --> 02:27:01.912]  What were they doing to him?
[02:27:02.593 --> 02:27:07.098]  Basically, they dumped trailers and construction equipment.
[02:27:07.118 --> 02:27:08.620]  His house would be vibrating.
[02:27:09.455 --> 02:27:12.996]  All hours of the day, they had these massive floodlights.
[02:27:13.537 --> 02:27:15.898]  I mean, and on top of that, his wife was blind.
[02:27:16.198 --> 02:27:18.799]  She never even knew what was going on around her.
[02:27:18.819 --> 02:27:22.240]  That sounds like Waco, where they had the lights shining on them.
[02:27:22.280 --> 02:27:23.200]  My goodness.
[02:27:24.461 --> 02:27:29.203]  You know, I mean, and like I said, these are two elderly people who lived in their homes all their lives.
[02:27:29.223 --> 02:27:31.204]  Well, I want to hear about some of the other harassment.
[02:27:31.224 --> 02:27:33.144]  I know I was talking to you earlier that there's even more.
[02:27:33.725 --> 02:27:36.626]  Well, let's chronicle the abuse here in the new Soviet America.
[02:27:38.209 --> 02:27:39.092]  We're on the march.
[02:27:39.613 --> 02:27:41.218]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:42.120 --> 02:27:44.807]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.047 --> 02:27:54.291]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:27:54.411 --> 02:28:00.594]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:00.875 --> 02:28:09.300]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:28:09.560 --> 02:28:16.564]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:28:16.864 --> 02:28:21.707]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:28:21.907 --> 02:28:27.311]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:28:27.651 --> 02:28:30.753]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.

[02:31:07.473 --> 02:31:09.435]  They already stole one of his homes back in 1971.
[02:31:09.515 --> 02:31:13.518]  Now they're taking their two other homes, bought and paid for.
[02:31:14.619 --> 02:31:17.381]  Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars on the property rolls.
[02:31:17.401 --> 02:31:19.503]  They're giving them a fraction of that.
[02:31:20.263 --> 02:31:24.026]  And they're talking about charging them back taxes or rent.
[02:31:24.127 --> 02:31:27.109]  Because imagine, they condemn your house so they can devalue it.
[02:31:28.270 --> 02:31:29.791]  To not even pay you.
[02:31:30.372 --> 02:31:31.873]  Folks, this is so criminal.
[02:31:32.438 --> 02:31:40.908]  Before we go back to the calls, talking about this travesty in New London, Connecticut, folks, can you imagine people coming to your door?
[02:31:42.730 --> 02:31:43.931]  This is John Doe.
[02:31:44.872 --> 02:31:47.756]  Hello, 75-year-old lady.
[02:31:47.796 --> 02:31:49.678]  Listen, you need to sign this contract.
[02:31:49.718 --> 02:31:50.959]  You see those bulldozers?
[02:31:51.240 --> 02:31:53.202]  I'm about to bulldoze you if you don't do it.
[02:31:54.102 --> 02:32:04.146]  And then coming up as they bought the property next to it, with lights shining in your house and making noise and, you know, scumbag people out in their bulldozers.
[02:32:04.486 --> 02:32:06.467]  You better do it, boy!
[02:32:06.487 --> 02:32:13.529]  I mean, just you understand how evil that, I mean, what type of scum?
[02:32:13.890 --> 02:32:16.591]  Well, I'm just a contractor and I'm paid to do it.
[02:32:16.811 --> 02:32:20.192]  And I got a job and I'm going to carry you down.
[02:32:20.972 --> 02:32:22.533]  Just don't come around my house.
[02:32:23.408 --> 02:32:24.749]  You pieces of garbage.
[02:32:25.429 --> 02:32:28.150]  Some bully comes to my house doing that, you're not going to like what happens.
[02:32:28.210 --> 02:32:29.030]  I guarantee it.
[02:32:29.850 --> 02:32:32.411]  And don't you threaten me with a deadly weapon with a bulldozer.
[02:32:32.771 --> 02:32:35.712]  The minute they did that, I'd stick a video camera in their face.
[02:32:35.992 --> 02:32:36.993]  No, I'd set them up.
[02:32:37.293 --> 02:32:41.554]  I'd turn the cameras on, have it hidden up there in a planter, up by the, like I do.
[02:32:42.455 --> 02:32:44.495]  I'd have a camera hidden up there on the planter.
[02:32:44.535 --> 02:32:46.136]  I'd hit the button to start the VCR.
[02:32:46.396 --> 02:32:48.757]  I'd act all scared and let them say lots of
[02:32:48.837 --> 02:32:50.038]  Criminal stuff, yeah.
[02:32:50.478 --> 02:32:52.519]  And then I'd go and I'd charge them.
[02:32:52.739 --> 02:32:56.341]  I'd make sure they got charged with harassment and intimidation.
[02:32:56.381 --> 02:32:57.842]  Folks, that's what the mafia does.
[02:32:58.382 --> 02:33:05.226]  You take my cousin Luigi, and you put him on as your store manager, and you pay him $30,000 a year.
[02:33:05.266 --> 02:33:05.866]  This was back in the 40s.
[02:33:05.886 --> 02:33:08.728]  Well, we're going to burn your business down.
[02:33:09.448 --> 02:33:13.010]  Now, you do what I say, or it's extortion, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:13.230 --> 02:33:14.291]  It's racketeering.
[02:33:15.071 --> 02:33:18.832]  And I'm about to get on a plane and go up to New London.
[02:33:18.872 --> 02:33:20.633]  I want to be there when the bulldozers come in.
[02:33:22.334 --> 02:33:29.236]  And I bet they've got scumbag cops that are going straight to hell who will arrest these old people whenever they say no to the bulldozers.
[02:33:29.296 --> 02:33:30.536]  I bet they'll SWAT team them.
[02:33:30.556 --> 02:33:32.437]  I bet they'll taser them.
[02:33:32.717 --> 02:33:34.198]  I bet they're scum of the earth.
[02:33:34.218 --> 02:33:35.478]  All right, I'm sorry.
[02:33:35.518 --> 02:33:37.339]  I'm really getting emotional and upset about this.
[02:33:38.779 --> 02:33:40.600]  Going back to our guests, and we'll go to your calls.
[02:33:42.501 --> 02:33:49.825]  Michael, you know, we get upset about football and baseball, but we really should get upset physically, Michael, about what's happening to you and others.
[02:33:50.926 --> 02:33:52.507]  It's everyone's property rights.
[02:33:52.607 --> 02:33:53.647]  There's no one safe.
[02:33:54.588 --> 02:34:01.892]  If you're a future property owner, I mean, it could be your children, your grandchildren, everyone's at stake here with your property rights.
[02:34:02.372 --> 02:34:06.555]  But, I mean, to say you're going to have to pay back rent, so that's pure intimidation and extortion.
[02:34:06.895 --> 02:34:07.955]  Absolutely.
[02:34:07.995 --> 02:34:10.477]  Now, tell me specifically about this woman who had the heart attack.
[02:34:11.525 --> 02:34:12.826]  Well, my mom.
[02:34:13.766 --> 02:34:23.871]  What basically happened was the sheriff came to their door on a Wednesday afternoon and they handed her condemnation papers.
[02:34:25.703 --> 02:34:28.144]  Well, they say moving is more painful psychologically than a death in the family.
[02:34:48.183 --> 02:34:48.963]  You're absolutely right.
[02:34:49.003 --> 02:34:54.606]  I mean, can you imagine someone in their 70s and their 80s that are being relocated to a new home that they don't want to be in?
[02:34:55.086 --> 02:34:58.428]  Well, plus with the amount of money you get, you can't buy something comparable.
[02:34:58.628 --> 02:34:59.588]  You're absolutely right.
[02:34:59.628 --> 02:35:02.850]  The city is basically making all these families homeless.
[02:35:03.070 --> 02:35:04.730]  That's what I'm basically looking at.
[02:35:05.071 --> 02:35:06.571]  You know, they're going to steal the property.
[02:35:06.631 --> 02:35:07.852]  Why not give you the money?
[02:35:07.872 --> 02:35:09.333]  Because they're evil, folks.
[02:35:10.093 --> 02:35:10.873]  You're absolutely right.
[02:35:11.153 --> 02:35:12.034]  Robbing old ladies.
[02:35:13.405 --> 02:35:14.966]  What about this 92-year-old man?
[02:35:15.107 --> 02:35:16.728]  Did it contribute to his death?
[02:35:17.148 --> 02:35:17.689]  Absolutely.
[02:35:17.709 --> 02:35:19.811]  Can you imagine the stress that poor man went through?
[02:35:20.691 --> 02:35:27.097]  All I want to know is, sir, and I can tell you I know a little bit about the law, this is intimidation, this is racketeering, this is extortion.
[02:35:27.557 --> 02:35:30.460]  You've got to get lawyers from outside the city, and you've got to sue them.
[02:35:32.016 --> 02:35:37.238]  We're going to look at every avenue at this point, you know, to protect our property still, because we're not going anywhere.
[02:35:37.578 --> 02:35:39.739]  They're going to be dragging us off that property.
[02:35:39.759 --> 02:35:42.341]  Well, then what does the sign mean for sale?
[02:35:42.681 --> 02:35:44.142]  It says, not for sale.
[02:35:44.222 --> 02:35:45.222]  Oh, see, I'm ignorant.
[02:35:45.302 --> 02:35:46.223]  Not for sale.
[02:35:46.363 --> 02:35:48.144]  Yes, it's not for sale.
[02:35:48.824 --> 02:35:51.005]  And that's exactly how we stand behind it.
[02:35:51.705 --> 02:35:52.566]  So what's going to happen?
[02:35:53.566 --> 02:35:54.607]  Like I said, you know...
[02:35:55.157 --> 02:35:56.759]  Do you know about the day newspaper?
[02:35:56.839 --> 02:35:57.380]  Absolutely.
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:35:58.681]  The local paper there?
[02:35:59.002 --> 02:35:59.122]  Yes.
[02:35:59.142 --> 02:35:59.803]  They misquoted you then.
[02:35:59.823 --> 02:36:00.464]  Listen to this.
[02:36:11.323 --> 02:36:16.465]  Drive by Michael Cristofaro's home at 50 Denison Avenue tomorrow, and he promises you'll see a sign for sale.
[02:36:16.885 --> 02:36:17.505]  I'm out of here.
[02:36:17.545 --> 02:36:18.645]  I'm selling my home.
[02:36:18.665 --> 02:36:23.247]  A new London resident of 43 years said, they on purpose misquoted you.
[02:36:23.327 --> 02:36:25.408]  No, that's actually not a misquote.
[02:36:25.528 --> 02:36:31.590]  That is my property that's around the corner from Goshen Street, which is not part of the eminent domain proceedings.
[02:36:32.430 --> 02:36:33.350]  I am going to sell.
[02:36:34.030 --> 02:36:39.032]  Oh, I got you, because you're so disgusted with the area, you are planning on leaving, but right now you're going to fight them.
[02:36:39.632 --> 02:36:39.832]  Right.
[02:36:40.113 --> 02:36:41.073]  Oh, now I understand.
[02:36:41.474 --> 02:36:42.454]  The riddle is solved.
[02:36:42.574 --> 02:36:43.655]  We're fighting.
[02:36:43.675 --> 02:36:45.677]  Right now, I'm fighting for my parents' property.
[02:36:46.077 --> 02:36:47.898]  Now, there's been so much harassment.
[02:36:49.099 --> 02:36:50.700]  There's been so much harassment going on.
[02:36:50.720 --> 02:36:52.341]  What other harassment's going on?
[02:36:53.022 --> 02:37:02.589]  Well, you know, like yesterday when the decision came down, the city actually had police cruisers and the fire trucks cruising our neighborhood because they thought there was going to be a riot.
[02:37:02.609 --> 02:37:04.170]  And I was like, what are they planning on doing?
[02:37:04.450 --> 02:37:05.310]  Hosing us down?
[02:37:05.330 --> 02:37:08.673]  You know, I mean, give us a break.
[02:37:09.488 --> 02:37:11.249]  We're just trying to protect our rights.
[02:37:11.569 --> 02:37:12.350]  We went to court.
[02:37:12.450 --> 02:37:13.211]  Okay, we lost.
[02:37:13.491 --> 02:37:13.971]  But you know what?
[02:37:13.991 --> 02:37:15.232]  We're looking at other avenues.
[02:37:15.512 --> 02:37:18.894]  You know, we do this on a legal basis, not the way the city does it.
[02:37:20.455 --> 02:37:22.036]  Sir, I want you to describe for me.
[02:37:22.076 --> 02:37:25.218]  Were you ever there when your mother had the people revving bulldozers at her?
[02:37:25.839 --> 02:37:26.920]  Of course.
[02:37:27.360 --> 02:37:31.202]  For the listeners, and we're going to calls, I want you to describe exactly what it's like.
[02:37:31.242 --> 02:37:33.364]  I want people to get a picture of pure evil.
[02:37:35.649 --> 02:37:36.109]  Absolutely.
[02:37:36.169 --> 02:37:37.830]  I mean, can you imagine... Hello?
[02:37:38.171 --> 02:37:39.271]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:39.331 --> 02:37:55.221]  I mean, can you imagine, you know, seeing these big, you know, bulldozers pointing at your house, and like you said, you know, they stop revving their engines, and you see that little smoke stack up on top of the little lid, you know, opening and closing with all that black smoke billowing, okay?
[02:37:55.461 --> 02:38:01.705]  And all they do is rev it for about five or ten minutes, turn it off, then they, you know, turn it back on, and they'll raise the front of the...
[02:38:02.426 --> 02:38:03.267]  The bulldozer.
[02:38:03.367 --> 02:38:07.250]  You know, I've heard of these cases where the big old boy up front says, I'm very sorry, ma'am.
[02:38:07.530 --> 02:38:09.032]  But instead, no, it was somebody.
[02:38:09.312 --> 02:38:10.633]  They didn't even have the orders.
[02:38:10.693 --> 02:38:13.115]  They're just there saying, sign, sign, sign.
[02:38:13.315 --> 02:38:13.976]  Describe that.
[02:38:15.117 --> 02:38:28.829]  Well, they basically, you know, they come with your contract in their hands, okay, and you've got to understand, these were real estate agents hired by the city of New London, and their only order was, you get them to sign this contract, and you get an $8,000 commission.
[02:38:29.309 --> 02:38:30.270]  We don't care how you do it.
[02:38:32.109 --> 02:38:33.690]  You need to sue them.
[02:38:33.770 --> 02:38:37.893]  You need to sue their minions because the next time their minions won't follow the orders.
[02:38:37.913 --> 02:38:38.113]  No.
[02:38:38.754 --> 02:38:47.241]  And you know the other sad part is, even if this was a legal eminent domain proceedings where they had to take property, they didn't even try preserving any of these properties.
[02:38:47.301 --> 02:38:48.122]  Well, you know what?
[02:38:48.222 --> 02:38:48.723]  They did it.
[02:38:48.743 --> 02:38:49.063]  They did it.
[02:39:06.556 --> 02:39:07.497]  What did you say to him?
[02:39:07.917 --> 02:39:14.103]  I told him to get off this property, do not come near us, do not call us, do not even bother us.
[02:39:14.143 --> 02:39:16.405]  The place is just not for sale at any price.
[02:39:16.825 --> 02:39:17.626]  This is our home.
[02:39:17.766 --> 02:39:18.547]  When did this happen?
[02:39:19.388 --> 02:39:19.728]  Back in 2000, 1998, 1999.
[02:39:20.248 --> 02:39:23.992]  And again, give me a ballpark.
[02:39:24.052 --> 02:39:26.414]  How many people did they intimidate like this who sold?
[02:39:26.714 --> 02:39:27.495]  Oh, you're talking 75.
[02:39:27.535 --> 02:39:28.095]  75 people, 75 families.
[02:39:28.115 --> 02:39:29.537]  75 of our closest neighbors.
[02:39:34.013 --> 02:39:35.374]  What were the stories they told you?
[02:39:35.414 --> 02:39:36.916]  What type of harassment did they deal with?
[02:39:37.276 --> 02:39:38.877]  Basically the same type of harassment.
[02:39:38.957 --> 02:39:43.401]  And like I said, a lot of them were in their late 70s and early 80s.
[02:39:43.922 --> 02:39:48.085]  And some of them were sick, and they just didn't have the fight.
[02:39:48.105 --> 02:39:49.446]  They were just trying to survive.
[02:39:49.987 --> 02:39:53.710]  You need to go to a store, major, major supply stores.
[02:39:53.730 --> 02:39:56.012]  I don't like to advertise Sam's, but I know they have it.
[02:39:56.632 --> 02:39:58.274]  And that's close, and you're in an emergency.
[02:39:58.694 --> 02:40:00.556]  They have these VCRs that record...
[02:40:01.434 --> 02:40:04.396]  Well, you know what, like I said, right now we're just trying to stay in our homes.
[02:40:30.831 --> 02:40:34.858]  I know, but these units will have four different cameras, four different cameras, split screen.
[02:40:35.059 --> 02:40:37.483]  You can put them all around your house and catch them doing stuff.
[02:40:39.527 --> 02:40:40.328]  I like that idea.
[02:40:40.689 --> 02:40:42.352]  Just believe me, I know how to deal with these people.
[02:40:43.113 --> 02:40:44.015]  It's called hardball.
[02:40:45.459 --> 02:40:45.839]  Okay.
[02:40:47.260 --> 02:40:48.160]  Man, I'll tell you.
[02:40:48.600 --> 02:40:50.240]  Anything else you want to add before we take calls, Mike?
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:58.022]  Well, you know, one of the other intimidations, you know, Mr. Billy Von Winkle's property, he has like a tenement building with maybe, you know, five or six apartments in it.
[02:40:58.503 --> 02:41:07.025]  During the winter, they came and threw out all of his tenants in their pajamas and bare feet in the wintertime where there's snow on the ground.
[02:41:07.065 --> 02:41:08.385]  But it gets below zero there.
[02:41:08.445 --> 02:41:11.006]  Yes, and then they padlocked them out of their house.
[02:41:11.406 --> 02:41:13.428]  And they didn't even own the property yet.
[02:41:13.788 --> 02:41:14.909]  So what ended up happening?
[02:41:15.209 --> 02:41:17.210]  Well, there was an altercation.
[02:41:17.791 --> 02:41:26.717]  The police came and they basically told them that there was nothing they could do because Billy Von Winkle didn't own the property because the city had taken it by eminent domain.
[02:41:27.458 --> 02:41:29.919]  And he's like, these people need to get back into their homes.
[02:41:29.939 --> 02:41:30.520]  They're freezing.
[02:41:31.787 --> 02:41:34.188]  So he basically, you know, the cops ended up leaving.
[02:41:34.208 --> 02:41:38.888]  He ended up going into his apartment building, breaking the doors open to let his people back in.
[02:41:39.249 --> 02:41:40.649]  What ended up happening with that fight?
[02:41:41.189 --> 02:41:47.670]  And then he contacted the Institute for Justice, and they called and got it straightened out that these people could remain in their homes.
[02:41:47.690 --> 02:41:49.051]  Yeah, you're not allowed to do that.
[02:41:49.311 --> 02:41:49.471]  No.
[02:41:49.951 --> 02:41:51.231]  And these are the intimidations.
[02:41:51.271 --> 02:41:56.752]  Can you imagine, you know, waking up first thing in the morning and being thrown out of your apartment?
[02:41:58.032 --> 02:41:59.813]  How do these cops live with themselves?
[02:42:00.093 --> 02:42:00.673]  I wish I knew.
[02:42:02.120 --> 02:42:05.063]  Do you ever walk up to them and they're drinking coffee and go, shame on you?
[02:42:05.424 --> 02:42:05.604]  Yeah.
[02:42:06.505 --> 02:42:06.885]  Oh, you do?
[02:42:06.925 --> 02:42:07.486]  What do they say?
[02:42:08.467 --> 02:42:11.030]  They basically say, well, we're just following the law.
[02:42:11.170 --> 02:42:12.071]  There's nothing we can do.
[02:42:12.131 --> 02:42:13.852]  Yeah, that's what we heard in Nazi Germany.
[02:42:14.373 --> 02:42:14.813]  Exactly.
[02:42:15.594 --> 02:42:16.355]  What do you think we are?
[02:42:16.375 --> 02:42:16.956]  We're in Russia.
[02:42:19.671 --> 02:42:24.993]  We're basically turning into a communist state here where you don't have any rights at all.
[02:42:25.234 --> 02:42:27.735]  Well, I keep meaning to go to calls, but the horrors keep getting worse.
[02:42:27.775 --> 02:42:28.435]  Anything else?
[02:42:29.856 --> 02:42:31.736]  I mean, I could talk the air off.
[02:42:32.597 --> 02:42:34.298]  Well, you have been, so I'm glad.
[02:42:34.358 --> 02:42:36.299]  It's been going on for the last seven years.
[02:42:36.559 --> 02:42:38.059]  I'm glad you're getting it all out.
[02:42:38.399 --> 02:42:40.160]  Let's talk to Mike in Louisiana.
[02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:41.121]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:42:41.141 --> 02:42:41.661]  How are you doing?
[02:42:41.941 --> 02:42:42.821]  I'm doing pretty good.
[02:42:42.882 --> 02:42:44.662]  I'm just getting sick to my stomach listening.
[02:42:44.702 --> 02:42:48.344]  The more and more information that he reveals, it's sickening to me.
[02:42:48.624 --> 02:42:49.566]  I think we're good to go.
[02:43:04.778 --> 02:43:05.779]  You know, pony up a little bit of money.
[02:43:05.799 --> 02:43:10.143]  Well, I wouldn't attack the land rights area now because of the Supreme Court.
[02:43:10.383 --> 02:43:12.405]  I would attack all the other criminality.
[02:43:12.705 --> 02:43:13.166]  Sure, sure.
[02:43:13.186 --> 02:43:13.706]  There's plenty.
[02:43:13.786 --> 02:43:16.389]  I mean, you've got a cornucopia of options, it seems like.
[02:43:16.649 --> 02:43:18.731]  And attack them on three or four.
[02:43:18.931 --> 02:43:19.532]  Sure, sure.
[02:43:19.592 --> 02:43:22.274]  But, you know, that's going to cost money.
[02:43:22.354 --> 02:43:26.038]  Well, there's a lot of good lawyers that left out there, and they should do this for free.
[02:43:26.238 --> 02:43:26.758]  Sure, sure.
[02:43:27.019 --> 02:43:29.221]  Right now we have the Institute of Justice backing us up.
[02:43:29.841 --> 02:43:35.468]  Yeah, and one other point I wanted to make, Alex, is the ripple effect of the home values over the long run for people, anybody who's not in
[02:43:49.950 --> 02:43:50.771]  I hear you, Mike.
[02:43:50.871 --> 02:43:51.611]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:51.631 --> 02:43:52.252]  Who's up next here?
[02:44:11.681 --> 02:44:12.582]  Wendy in Michigan.
[02:44:12.602 --> 02:44:12.922]  Go ahead.
[02:44:12.942 --> 02:44:13.782]  You're on the air, Wendy.
[02:44:14.223 --> 02:44:15.504]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:15.644 --> 02:44:20.026]  I've been deceiving about this for the last two days, and I don't even own property.
[02:44:22.668 --> 02:44:31.734]  You know, I just want to know, if push comes to shove, is that fine gentleman going to meet them at the door to exercise his Second Amendment rights?
[02:44:34.096 --> 02:44:36.197]  Sir, she's saying will you physically confront them?
[02:44:38.448 --> 02:44:38.929]  You know what?
[02:44:39.229 --> 02:44:46.756]  If they confronted me and they really pushed the right buttons, you bet your life I'll confront them, and I'll be confronting them more than with just my fist.
[02:44:47.296 --> 02:44:48.117]  Good job, sir.
[02:44:49.578 --> 02:44:50.079]  All right.
[02:44:50.159 --> 02:44:51.200]  Well, thank you, Wendy.
[02:44:51.480 --> 02:44:52.401]  Who's up after her?
[02:44:52.942 --> 02:44:53.362]  Leslie?
[02:44:54.123 --> 02:44:55.043]  Leslie in Virginia.
[02:44:55.084 --> 02:44:55.744]  Go ahead, Leslie.
[02:44:56.084 --> 02:44:57.085]  Hi, Alex.
[02:44:57.165 --> 02:44:59.748]  I agree with you in the way this thing should be approached.
[02:44:59.808 --> 02:45:01.810]  Now, Michael, I need to ask you a question here.
[02:45:02.949 --> 02:45:09.691]  Did you go after the disclosures of the supervisors that are involved in this?
[02:45:10.311 --> 02:45:10.911]  You get that?
[02:45:11.171 --> 02:45:14.372]  And the judges as well because I'll tell you why this is so important.
[02:45:14.712 --> 02:45:19.814]  You need to show conflicts of interest and beware of the limited partnerships now.
[02:45:20.273 --> 02:45:25.994]  The reason why this is so important is the disclosure form that is filed for the federal agencies.
[02:45:27.175 --> 02:45:30.535]  And you can compare that with the state agencies or under a microscope.
[02:45:31.016 --> 02:45:31.676]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:45:31.696 --> 02:45:36.977]  These city council people on this development board, they're not allowed to have conflicts, though they all do.
[02:45:37.157 --> 02:45:38.597]  Every single one of them does.
[02:45:39.018 --> 02:45:40.678]  And we're bringing all that information out.
[02:45:40.938 --> 02:45:44.579]  Yeah, I want to caution you with the limited partnerships because they changed the law on this.
[02:45:44.699 --> 02:45:47.119]  And, Alex, that's another show.
[02:45:47.540 --> 02:45:49.140]  And the way they hide this,
[02:45:49.520 --> 02:45:50.901]  Okay, listen, I appreciate the call.
[02:45:50.921 --> 02:45:51.942]  Any comments on that, sir?
[02:45:51.962 --> 02:45:58.929]  Like I said, we are looking at all the conflicts of interest and believing we're going to go after each and every one of them to find out...
[02:46:15.211 --> 02:46:16.752]  You know how they're lining their pockets.
[02:46:37.253 --> 02:46:52.347]  The issue you brought up, Alex, about going after them in these other different ways, videoing and all that, and the lawsuit and whatnot, where do you find a judge that's going to not throw it out or not going to be buddies with the people that are trying to take your home in the first place?
[02:46:52.367 --> 02:46:55.429]  You know, if you bring out enough of their corruption, they scatter.
[02:46:55.509 --> 02:46:56.370]  It'll hurt them.
[02:46:58.432 --> 02:47:01.495]  What'll happen is they'll at least just run off to feed on somebody else.
[02:47:02.805 --> 02:47:06.247]  Well, the thing is, you can always give them to the radio stations and everything else.
[02:47:06.407 --> 02:47:07.788]  They eat that stuff up.
[02:47:08.348 --> 02:47:24.378]  And once the public sees it, they, you know... Lou Dobbs had a poll last night, and I did get the actual numbers, out of 4,006 respondents were against this, and 44 people out of 4,000-plus were for it.
[02:47:25.039 --> 02:47:27.620]  So, I mean, no one's for this, and it's unconstitutional.
[02:47:27.861 --> 02:47:28.621]  You're absolutely right.
[02:47:28.681 --> 02:47:31.583]  And if this vote went to the general public, we would have won ages ago.
[02:47:32.853 --> 02:47:34.554]  Yeah, I don't know what those justices would think.
[02:47:34.654 --> 02:47:35.795]  It's your property!
[02:47:36.156 --> 02:47:36.836]  You own it!
[02:47:37.336 --> 02:47:45.683]  It's for some private corporations have gone... Understand, they go lobby if they can show that they'll, quote, make more money off your land than you will, that you own.
[02:47:45.723 --> 02:47:48.545]  They take it from you and then don't even pay you what it's worth!
[02:47:48.565 --> 02:47:48.945]  Yep.
[02:47:49.345 --> 02:47:56.271]  And this is all because Pfizer's came into town and the city of New London wanted to bend over backwards to do whatever Pfizer's wanted.
[02:47:57.632 --> 02:47:57.832]  I mean...
[02:47:58.414 --> 02:48:00.995]  So you talk about your greedy corporation.
[02:48:01.375 --> 02:48:02.635]  Pfizer, the drug company.
[02:48:02.855 --> 02:48:03.335]  You got it.
[02:48:05.196 --> 02:48:08.197]  And again, in your area, they're going to be building houses.
[02:48:08.317 --> 02:48:08.737]  What else?
[02:48:08.897 --> 02:48:13.938]  It's going to be a hotel, conference center, biotech building, a fitness club.
[02:48:14.278 --> 02:48:16.239]  And they kept saying, this is for public use.
[02:48:16.319 --> 02:48:17.899]  And I go, how is this for public use?
[02:48:18.179 --> 02:48:21.320]  Am I able to go into that fitness center and use that fitness center for free?
[02:48:22.060 --> 02:48:22.681]  They said no.
[02:48:22.821 --> 02:48:33.169]  I said, how am I going to be able to afford to walk into a fitness club that you're basically subjecting it to the white-collar worker that's making $400,000 or $500,000?
[02:48:33.810 --> 02:48:34.550]  It's insane.
[02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:38.473]  Michael Cristofaro, thank you so much for coming on with us, my friend.
[02:48:38.713 --> 02:48:40.054]  Well, thank you so very much.
[02:48:40.255 --> 02:48:44.338]  Keep us in your prayers and hope that we stay in our homes.
[02:48:44.538 --> 02:48:45.018]  I will, sir.
[02:48:45.038 --> 02:48:45.579]  God bless you.
[02:48:49.068 --> 02:48:51.929]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:52.189 --> 02:48:53.769]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:54.109 --> 02:48:58.771]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:59.111 --> 02:49:03.552]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:03.972 --> 02:49:08.133]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:08.373 --> 02:49:11.214]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:11.294 --> 02:49:15.976]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:16.156 --> 02:49:20.578]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:20.818 --> 02:49:28.040]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:28.280 --> 02:49:30.721]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:49:55.766 --> 02:50:06.697]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:06.937 --> 02:50:07.357]  We're good to go.
[02:50:07.458 --> 02:50:07.618]  I think?
[02:50:23.431 --> 02:50:23.931]  That's right.
[02:50:24.111 --> 02:50:31.233]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:31.513 --> 02:50:40.256]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:51:14.998 --> 02:51:16.199]  And you'll have more energy.
[02:51:16.279 --> 02:51:21.060]  What's more, your body can clean and clear your arteries on its own as long as it has the proper nutrients.
[02:51:21.300 --> 02:51:24.301]  Everybody understands the importance of keeping their arteries clear.
[02:51:24.401 --> 02:51:29.543]  But did you know that in 25% of the cases, the first symptom of blocked arteries is death?
[02:51:29.703 --> 02:51:31.464]  Don't take unnecessary risks.
[02:51:31.724 --> 02:51:35.505]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:35.545 --> 02:51:37.025]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:52:05.493 --> 02:52:08.615]  So, you just heard the rest of the story, as they said.
[02:52:10.056 --> 02:52:19.423]  As they say, revving bulldozers, harassment, people being thrown out of their homes in the dead of winter with no orders, no court orders, just private people doing it.
[02:52:22.445 --> 02:52:24.066]  This is the new world order.
[02:52:25.675 --> 02:52:28.538]  And I guess, you know, the government's doing its job.
[02:52:28.578 --> 02:52:29.859]  I mean, you may be with Al-Qaeda.
[02:52:29.919 --> 02:52:31.100]  We've got to do this to fight Al-Qaeda.
[02:52:31.120 --> 02:52:32.181]  Everything's to fight Al-Qaeda.
[02:52:32.721 --> 02:52:33.482]  All this tyranny.
[02:52:33.943 --> 02:52:35.244]  Where's George Bush about this?
[02:52:35.264 --> 02:52:36.465]  Where's Congress about this?
[02:52:37.486 --> 02:52:37.866]  Nowhere.
[02:52:39.027 --> 02:52:40.388]  Not a word is being said.
[02:52:42.130 --> 02:52:44.832]  And again, it makes my blood boil.
[02:52:44.972 --> 02:52:46.974]  John in Missouri, last caller.
[02:52:46.994 --> 02:52:47.755]  Yes.
[02:52:47.795 --> 02:52:47.935]  Yes.
[02:52:49.646 --> 02:52:58.293]  I was told here in Missouri, I don't know if they fight or not, but if they become incorporated, the eminent domain won't touch them.
[02:53:01.276 --> 02:53:04.298]  What, you create a corporation for your house?
[02:53:05.039 --> 02:53:08.182]  Well, yeah, for yourself, you're incorporated.
[02:53:08.622 --> 02:53:11.024]  I'll try to find out some more about it and call you back.
[02:53:11.044 --> 02:53:14.547]  A gentleman here that works here with me was telling me about it.
[02:53:16.041 --> 02:53:19.444]  Well, I've never heard that, but it doesn't sound accurate.
[02:53:19.464 --> 02:53:20.044]  But who knows?
[02:53:20.104 --> 02:53:20.504]  It could be.
[02:53:20.945 --> 02:53:25.408]  Well, I mean, like, you know, a corporation can't come in and buy another corporation.
[02:53:26.889 --> 02:53:29.231]  Corporations can't buy another corporation?
[02:53:29.251 --> 02:53:32.994]  Well, I mean, you know, if you buy, you know, you know how they buy each other out.
[02:53:33.054 --> 02:53:36.677]  But I'll try and find out some more information on it and get back with you.
[02:53:37.677 --> 02:53:38.898]  Okay, John, thank you.
[02:53:39.499 --> 02:53:39.999]  Interesting.
[02:53:41.360 --> 02:53:42.161]  Now, understand...
[02:53:43.223 --> 02:53:46.665]  I talked earlier in the show about how they don't give you the value of your home.
[02:53:47.566 --> 02:53:55.110]  And then we discovered in the case of New London, they actually just condemn your house out of hand because they say they now own it.
[02:53:56.431 --> 02:54:02.275]  And then they go, well, it's only now for the value of your lot, $60,000 instead of $200-something thousand.
[02:54:03.676 --> 02:54:08.459]  And then they come with bulldozers and say, sign the contract, agree with us, or we're going to tear it down.
[02:54:08.479 --> 02:54:09.599]  I mean, that's totally illegal.
[02:54:09.639 --> 02:54:10.520]  That's just made up.
[02:54:11.610 --> 02:54:12.750]  This is your last chance.
[02:54:12.830 --> 02:54:14.091]  Here, you better sign this.
[02:54:15.871 --> 02:54:19.472]  And of course, the police and the government are so corrupt, it doesn't matter if that's totally illegal.
[02:54:19.492 --> 02:54:21.873]  They just let you do it as long as you're the in-favor group.
[02:54:22.773 --> 02:54:24.834]  I mean, folks, don't try it because you'll go to prison.
[02:54:24.874 --> 02:54:33.516]  Imagine just getting a bulldozer, driving up to your neighbor's house and going, sell it to me for $50,000 when it's worth $215,000 or I'm going to bulldoze it right now.
[02:54:33.776 --> 02:54:34.937]  They'd go call the cops.
[02:54:35.397 --> 02:54:39.638]  There'd be a chase on the news as you're driving in your bulldozer with a cop shooting at you.
[02:54:41.027 --> 02:54:44.830]  But if you're the in crowd, hey!
[02:54:45.911 --> 02:54:47.573]  Are you starting to get it, folks?
[02:54:48.814 --> 02:54:53.598]  Are you starting to understand just how serious this is?
[02:54:54.298 --> 02:54:58.742]  This is how the Indianapolis Star, Guantanamo, the doctor's aided interrogator's paper reports.
[02:54:59.083 --> 02:55:01.845]  That came out two years ago that they're using doctors for torture.
[02:55:03.177 --> 02:55:10.361]  Military doctors at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba have aided interrogators in conducting and refining coercive interrogations of detainees.
[02:55:10.701 --> 02:55:11.661]  Why not call it torture?
[02:55:13.002 --> 02:55:21.666]  Including providing advice on how to exploit fears, according to new, detailed accounts given by former interrogators.
[02:55:22.367 --> 02:55:31.891]  The accounts and interviews with the New York Times come as mental health professionals are debating whether the doctors, psychiatrists, and psychologists at the prison camp have violated professional ethics codes.
[02:55:31.951 --> 02:55:32.852]  Oh, you've got to debate that?
[02:55:33.533 --> 02:55:36.676]  I mean, Joseph Mingala was just helping, too.
[02:55:37.476 --> 02:55:39.238]  Dr. Mingala?
[02:55:40.239 --> 02:55:42.160]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:42.501 --> 02:55:45.663]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:55:45.683 --> 02:55:46.464]  Hope you have a great weekend.
