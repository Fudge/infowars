[00:00:05.669 --> 00:00:06.309]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:08.029]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.870]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:11.330]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:12.971]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:17.472]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.832 --> 00:00:21.894]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.716 --> 00:00:30.423]  It's the second day of February 2005.
[00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:35.408]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:35.428 --> 00:00:37.190]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.892]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:46.539]  Don't let Congress fund Orwellian psychiatric screening for kids.
[00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:47.320]  This is the latest
[00:00:48.732 --> 00:00:51.556]  Release out from Congressman Ron Paul.
[00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:55.000]  They're already back in the new session after passing the new Freedom Initiative.
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:59.165]  And now they want to get even more funding.
[00:01:00.226 --> 00:01:00.727]  So we'll be
[00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:10.605]  Covering this report by Ron Paul, every parent in America should be made aware of a presidential initiative called the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health.
[00:01:10.685 --> 00:01:22.690]  This commission issued a report last year calling for the mandatory mental health screening of American school children, meaning millions of kids will be forced to undergo psychiatric screening whether their parents consent or not.
[00:01:24.085 --> 00:01:29.911]  That issue is the fundamental right of parents to decide what medical treatment is appropriate for their children.
[00:01:30.291 --> 00:01:30.972]  That's coming up.
[00:01:31.112 --> 00:01:33.254]  Also, every day I have articles like this.
[00:01:34.035 --> 00:01:36.477]  There's five of them in the stack today.
[00:01:36.538 --> 00:01:37.378]  Here's just a few of them.
[00:01:37.879 --> 00:01:41.903]  Man again sent to prison for junk in yard.
[00:01:43.004 --> 00:01:44.405]  Three years in prison.
[00:01:45.006 --> 00:01:47.709]  And, of course, when he bought the property, it wasn't zoned.
[00:01:48.542 --> 00:01:54.945]  He had some old cars and airplane parts out on his acreage and now he's already gone to jail once, this time three years in prison.
[00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:56.945]  Another one here.
[00:01:56.965 --> 00:02:02.047]  A blind man jailed for using non-standard browser.
[00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:10.171]  Used a Linux browser when he went to a website to donate money, a few bucks, to the Tsunami Fund.
[00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:13.392]  A SWAT team hit him and hit him hard.
[00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:23.103]  I think about 10% of the country uses Linux, but I guess, you know, they say if you've got a World Almanac or driving Atlas in your car, you're a terrorist.
[00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:26.064]  Wrist watches as a sign of terrorism.
[00:02:26.305 --> 00:02:27.285]  I don't wear a wrist watch.
[00:02:27.345 --> 00:02:33.709]  I do actually have a Road Almanac in my vehicle and the SWAT team may be hitting me within minutes.
[00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:40.314]  And I want to talk about how they're tracking your cell phones even at the county level.
[00:02:40.374 --> 00:02:41.615]  This is out of Capital News 9.
[00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:43.700]  Another article here.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.121]  Teen claims antidepressant led to murder.
[00:02:46.722 --> 00:02:47.622]  We'll go over that story.
[00:02:47.662 --> 00:02:51.585]  Also, a 12-year-old raised terrorism alarm.
[00:02:51.605 --> 00:02:54.287]  It was below zero.
[00:02:55.228 --> 00:02:59.551]  And they were waiting outside in their car at the airport to pick up family.
[00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:03.574]  And he had, you know, a face mask on.
[00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:05.635]  A little boy with a little mask on.
[00:03:06.576 --> 00:03:08.557]  And they called the SWAT team.
[00:03:08.597 --> 00:03:08.877]  Hit them.
[00:03:08.917 --> 00:03:09.678]  Hit them hard.
[00:03:10.478 --> 00:03:11.139]  Gotta do that.
[00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:24.613]  Of course, everybody knows terrorists wear black masks, unless it's the wonderful security forces in Iraq or our police, but anybody else wears a mask, even in sub-zero temperatures, and it's terrorism.
[00:03:25.234 --> 00:03:32.522]  I mean, obviously, if somebody's walking down the street in broad daylight in the summer with a mask on, you might want to check them out.
[00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:43.377]  But if it's, you know, you're up in Minnesota or Norway and it's 56 below zero, you don't wear a mask, your nose is going to fall off.
[00:03:43.978 --> 00:03:44.859]  It can kill you.
[00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.640]  It can make your nose freeze off.
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.481]  The end of your nose.
[00:03:48.021 --> 00:03:49.182]  It's called frostbite.
[00:03:49.222 --> 00:03:50.964]  But don't you wear that mask.
[00:03:51.004 --> 00:03:53.706]  We've got laws against you wearing a mask, even in the snow.
[00:03:54.626 --> 00:03:55.067]  Just like
[00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:57.828]  You've got a fishing knife in your tackle box?
[00:03:57.888 --> 00:04:00.230]  Doesn't matter if you've got a bucket of fish in the back of your truck.
[00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.592]  Doesn't matter if you're an old World War II vet.
[00:04:02.612 --> 00:04:03.652]  We're gonna take you to jail.
[00:04:04.213 --> 00:04:05.494]  Everything's a crime.
[00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:06.895]  Everything.
[00:04:08.216 --> 00:04:08.637]  Everything.
[00:04:09.477 --> 00:04:14.601]  So, uh... I was up in New Mexico, up there skiing, and it was real cold.
[00:04:14.842 --> 00:04:15.322]  Zero.
[00:04:15.902 --> 00:04:17.223]  Like five degrees one day.
[00:04:17.243 --> 00:04:19.585]  And I did have a ski mask.
[00:04:19.645 --> 00:04:20.566]  I was wearing it.
[00:04:21.307 --> 00:04:25.250]  I thought about it when I put it on, but other people were wearing ski masks, so I guess we were all terrorists.
[00:04:26.135 --> 00:04:27.095]  And, uh, well, you know.
[00:04:28.036 --> 00:04:28.956]  Ha ha ha ha!
[00:04:29.396 --> 00:04:30.737]  So that's all coming up, too.
[00:04:31.197 --> 00:04:32.417]  There is just so much.
[00:04:32.457 --> 00:04:34.038]  That's just the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:34.058 --> 00:04:37.919]  I will detail all of it after this quick break.
[00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.841]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[00:04:43.321 --> 00:04:51.284]  The websites are InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, and PrisonPlanet.gov.
[00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:56.740]  And we shall return on the other side of this quick break, so keep it locked in!
[00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:05.462]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.642 --> 00:05:10.083]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.203 --> 00:05:14.585]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.625 --> 00:05:15.985]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.765 --> 00:05:18.147]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:41.942]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.102 --> 00:05:47.483]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:47.984 --> 00:05:51.365]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.405 --> 00:05:51.745]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.765 --> 00:05:53.045]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:06:02.208 --> 00:06:03.249]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:06.371]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.631 --> 00:06:10.774]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.215 --> 00:06:12.035]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.355 --> 00:06:16.919]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:19.540]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:34.726]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:34.766 --> 00:06:41.809]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.829]  Hey baby!
[00:06:42.849 --> 00:06:42.949]  Hello?
[00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:43.210]  Alright.
[00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:05.951]  Hey, I'll tell ya, I have lost over 40 pounds with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, and my energy level is just incredible.
[00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:07.713]  With me is Carla Jarrett from Vim and Vigor.
[00:07:07.953 --> 00:07:09.834]  Hey, last weekend, I helped my neighbor move.
[00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:11.876]  It took maybe three hours to move in boxes.
[00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:15.940]  Then I mowed the lawn, which I never would have done before I lost that 40 pounds.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.282]  And then after that, I went ahead and did my 20 minutes of cardio.
[00:07:19.423 --> 00:07:19.603]  Wow!
[00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:24.386]  Well, my wife actually mentioned that she was kind of amazed that I did all of that and just kind of kept going.
[00:07:24.706 --> 00:07:25.286]  Well, that's great.
[00:07:25.326 --> 00:07:28.148]  And just as a reminder, there's no stimulants in Collagenate.
[00:07:28.208 --> 00:07:28.408]  Right.
[00:07:28.428 --> 00:07:30.249]  So it's not that you're taking stimulants.
[00:07:30.269 --> 00:07:33.331]  It's more that because you've lost weight, you have more energy and you're feeling better.
[00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:33.932]  Absolutely.
[00:07:33.992 --> 00:07:34.812]  I'm sleeping better.
[00:07:35.092 --> 00:07:36.293]  I feel better during the day.
[00:07:36.313 --> 00:07:37.994]  I don't get as tired in the afternoons.
[00:07:38.154 --> 00:07:39.415]  And I'm able to do a lot more.
[00:07:39.555 --> 00:07:40.576]  Collagenate is safe.
[00:07:40.736 --> 00:07:41.396]  It's natural.
[00:07:41.496 --> 00:07:41.997]  It's healthy.
[00:07:42.137 --> 00:07:43.918]  And it's helped me to lose over 40 pounds now.
[00:07:44.138 --> 00:07:46.119]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:47.860]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.328 --> 00:08:19.409]  All right, my friends.
[00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:24.715]  Already Wednesday, the second day of February 2005.
[00:08:24.755 --> 00:08:25.636]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:08:28.266 --> 00:08:54.254]  Diving straight into the news, in the last segment I got into a whole bunch of different reports about people being arrested for junk in their yard, three years in prison, using a Linux browser to donate money to an online bank account, they arrest you, they SWAT team you, wearing a mask in below zero weather outside, they come and SWAT team you, just everything is terrorism, everything is evil.
[00:08:55.126 --> 00:09:03.449]  The American people are just flat bad and have to be corralled and kicked around and told whose boss or Al-Qaeda is going to get us.
[00:09:04.109 --> 00:09:05.970]  Basically, if we're slaves, we're safe.
[00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:07.470]  If we're free, we're not.
[00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:12.312]  And, you know, the government loves us and it's a tough job and they hate ruling us.
[00:09:12.992 --> 00:09:19.494]  Powerful people always hate ruling others, but it's a job that somebody's got to do and, well, they're just going to be our lords and masters.
[00:09:19.674 --> 00:09:21.555]  And it's just a good thing.
[00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:26.814]  And hey, after all, they just told us that the Iraq election was free and fair.
[00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:30.938]  It's the same government that tells us that open borders is good.
[00:09:30.958 --> 00:09:34.540]  It's the same government that tells us that there's no inflation.
[00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:41.866]  When a car that cost $15,000 10 years ago cost $35,000 today, and a house that cost $100,000 20 years ago cost $350,000 today, and well, when your dollar's been devalued by 40-plus percent,
[00:09:53.024 --> 00:09:54.085]  Yeah, it doesn't really matter.
[00:09:54.105 --> 00:09:56.347]  It's the same government that told you don't buy gold.
[00:09:56.407 --> 00:09:58.589]  It's not a good investment, as they buy it all up.
[00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:04.854]  It's the same government that has been caught lying to us thousands of times, but you know what?
[00:10:04.874 --> 00:10:06.476]  They're not lying to us this time.
[00:10:06.996 --> 00:10:07.837]  And that's what matters.
[00:10:07.877 --> 00:10:08.658]  We can trust them.
[00:10:09.158 --> 00:10:10.519]  We can give our rights up to them.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.363]  Of course, Congressman Ron Paul is a little bit upset about the New Freedom Initiative.
[00:10:15.824 --> 00:10:17.205]  You see, they do this piecemeal.
[00:10:18.146 --> 00:10:20.608]  About a month and a half ago, in early December,
[00:10:22.344 --> 00:10:34.114]  December 7th to be exact, a day that will live in infamy, they passed the New Freedom Initiative and gave it a paltry funding mechanism of only 25 million dollars.
[00:10:35.715 --> 00:10:38.758]  Because they successfully in Congress did block some of the funding.
[00:10:39.058 --> 00:10:47.746]  But they got the initiative passed and then the feds simply tie it to other federal funds going to the states and the schools and so
[00:10:49.366 --> 00:10:50.667]  It is still moving forward.
[00:10:50.707 --> 00:10:58.655]  Well, now they're coming back with more funds to radically expand and implement the program.
[00:10:59.035 --> 00:11:06.722]  The forced psychological testing of all public schoolers, homeschoolers, and private schoolers across the nation.
[00:11:07.162 --> 00:11:08.043]  By law.
[00:11:08.764 --> 00:11:11.346]  Taking your children from you twice a year.
[00:11:11.847 --> 00:11:13.168]  Premeditated.
[00:11:14.301 --> 00:11:15.682]  So we'll be covering that in a few minutes.
[00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:22.465]  Then, of course, yesterday we talked about the legislation to expand the National ID Card.
[00:11:23.846 --> 00:11:31.349]  Now, again, a month and a half ago, in mid-December, they passed the 9-11 Bill, the Intelligence Act.
[00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:35.091]  It had several different public names that they brand-named it with.
[00:11:38.914 --> 00:11:49.663]  But in there, it federally standardizes all driver's license and ID cards, and federalizes the DMV facilities, and federalizes the databases.
[00:11:50.103 --> 00:12:04.735]  Well, the new bill will index hundreds of private databases into your file, and it will also standardize it with every country from Chile to Venezuela to Mexico to Canada.
[00:12:05.891 --> 00:12:09.953]  for the Pan-American Union, and actually goes into that in the bill.
[00:12:11.154 --> 00:12:14.695]  And then simultaneously, Ridge is calling for a global ID card.
[00:12:14.955 --> 00:12:29.142]  We're already merging and standardizing with Europe, Australia, and a score of other nations, Japan, just so many different countries that this is now happening.
[00:12:30.023 --> 00:12:31.283]  And it's the world government.
[00:12:31.303 --> 00:12:32.704]  It's the world ID card.
[00:12:34.019 --> 00:12:42.185]  So within a month and a half of them passing the National ID Card, they're already racing towards the International ID Card and calling it the National ID Card.
[00:12:42.525 --> 00:12:50.030]  And if you, you know, read USA Today or the Associated Press or Reuters or any of these articles, it's ridge-going, the outgoing ridge.
[00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.012]  We need a National ID Card!
[00:12:54.013 --> 00:12:55.614]  We really need it to stop terrorists.
[00:12:56.403 --> 00:12:59.487]  And then really what he's pushing and promoting is the World ID Card.
[00:12:59.527 --> 00:13:08.558]  You can punch in, Ridge calls for World Biometric Standards for IDs and you'll get him over in England calling for a World ID Card.
[00:13:08.578 --> 00:13:11.422]  It's a big deal, folks!
[00:13:11.462 --> 00:13:15.087]  I think you might want to be concerned about a World ID Card.
[00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:19.300]  Perhaps you'd like to mention that subject when you call in.
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:27.143]  I mean, I know the callers are always coming at us from left field and right field and from outside the field, but that's what makes it interesting.
[00:13:27.163 --> 00:13:39.729]  But I'd like you to address that, at least, to comment on the World ID Card on the heels, in train, right behind the National ID Card.
[00:13:40.839 --> 00:13:49.043]  We are now getting our regional ID card that's already being standardized and merged with the world identification system.
[00:13:50.324 --> 00:14:01.409]  And that is, they're doing the deals with Europe and Latin America and Asia where it's the same number sequence, the same biometric algorithm, key
[00:14:02.731 --> 00:14:18.432]  Same database, same system, but you'll argue with me, I know, in five years, when you're having to swipe this with the new national sales tax, may even be sooner, the new national war tax, well, a sales tax for the war, and we're about, don't worry, we're going to cut the income tax by 70%, and we do it.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.081]  That'll be the pitch.
[00:14:22.121 --> 00:14:23.221]  That could be within two years.
[00:14:23.362 --> 00:14:24.062]  Maybe even sooner.
[00:14:24.462 --> 00:14:25.443]  But it looks like five.
[00:14:25.843 --> 00:14:34.730]  When you're swiping your card at the grocery store, you can turn back and argue with me in line, like some of you like to do, and tell me, this isn't a National ID card.
[00:14:35.130 --> 00:14:36.291]  And I can say, no, it's not!
[00:14:36.331 --> 00:14:37.451]  It's a World ID card!
[00:14:37.471 --> 00:14:38.652]  You're absolutely correct!
[00:14:40.474 --> 00:14:42.795]  So it's very painful to see this happening.
[00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:47.779]  And all the controls that it'll bring, but, ah, so what?
[00:14:47.819 --> 00:14:49.060]  What do I got to hide?
[00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:50.821]  Let me have a National ID card.
[00:14:51.374 --> 00:14:53.315]  Let me have a national sales tax!
[00:14:53.716 --> 00:14:57.038]  Well, it'll mean more taxation, more regulation.
[00:14:57.058 --> 00:15:07.525]  It'll mean a federal terminal into every single cash register and company out there, by law.
[00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:10.687]  It'll track everything you buy, sell, and do.
[00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:15.630]  And at the same time, you'll still have to file an income tax return
[00:15:16.661 --> 00:15:23.384]  to assess which graduated sales tax bracket you're in, because the sales tax has to be fair.
[00:15:24.564 --> 00:15:45.152]  While we can't have poor people paying sales tax, which of course is reasonable, but that'll bring the federal control in, and that'll make it where you have to swipe the card when you do it, and then you'll also have to file that yearly tax return, and then you'll be the same bureaucracy, the same penalties, even worse, quote, trying to evade your tax bracket for your sales tax.
[00:15:47.427 --> 00:15:54.009]  And it's gonna, the sales tax will be graduated from 15% to 45% to start.
[00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:56.450]  Then of course they can ratchet that up.
[00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:59.430]  So, I hope you enjoy your National ID Card.
[00:15:59.650 --> 00:16:05.452]  And then of course everything you buy and what you eat will be put into a digital algorithm and formula.
[00:16:05.892 --> 00:16:08.613]  And then that will be given to the insurance companies.
[00:16:08.633 --> 00:16:09.553]  This is already public.
[00:16:10.093 --> 00:16:14.535]  And then they'll decide if you're eating things that are unhealthy and deny you insurance.
[00:16:15.495 --> 00:16:15.975]  And, uh,
[00:16:16.678 --> 00:16:22.222]  They will also use it to assess just how many people live in your house, and it just goes on and on and on.
[00:16:24.583 --> 00:16:38.472]  Meanwhile, while everything we do is being made transparent, they're making it easier for the illegal aliens and ordering the states to accept their fake ID cards, their consular matricula cards, and meanwhile the government's making everything they do a secret.
[00:16:39.395 --> 00:16:54.326]  So they're going into secrecy while giving the illegal aliens a blank check to do whatever they want, but the citizens, the good, gullible, stupid slaves, are now being shackled quite nicely.
[00:16:55.386 --> 00:16:59.949]  Don't let Congress fund Orwellian psychiatric screening of kids!
[00:17:00.690 --> 00:17:03.412]  This is Congressman Ron Pauls on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:17:04.389 --> 00:17:10.691]  Every parent in America should be made aware of a presidential initiative called the New Freedom Commission on Mental Health.
[00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:23.716]  This commission issued a report last year calling for the mandatory mental health screening of American school children, meaning millions of kids will be forced to undergo psychiatric screening whether their parents consent or not.
[00:17:24.476 --> 00:17:26.336]  Some of you are probably saying, over your dead body.
[00:17:26.676 --> 00:17:28.017]  Well, that's fine with the SWAT team.
[00:17:28.975 --> 00:17:35.298]  At issue is the fundamental right of parents to decide what medical treatment is appropriate for their children.
[00:17:36.339 --> 00:17:37.800]  Forced medical health screening?
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.522]  This goes hand-in-hand with forced inoculation and all of it.
[00:17:41.802 --> 00:17:45.764]  Forced mental health screening simply has no place in a freer, decent society.
[00:17:46.284 --> 00:17:47.625]  Well, how dare you, Congressman?
[00:17:48.865 --> 00:17:50.646]  Sounds kind of al-Qaeda-ish, what you just said.
[00:17:51.006 --> 00:17:53.748]  The government does not own you or your kids, really?
[00:17:55.148 --> 00:17:58.610]  Uh, I did get the little press release put out by Dr. Phil.
[00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:02.652]  He says the state controls your children and that being a parent is a privilege.
[00:18:02.692 --> 00:18:05.313]  So, obviously you haven't seen Dr. Phil.
[00:18:05.874 --> 00:18:09.475]  Forced mental health screening simply has no place in a free or decent society.
[00:18:09.856 --> 00:18:11.737]  The government does not own you or your kids.
[00:18:11.777 --> 00:18:12.537]  We'll tell them that.
[00:18:13.057 --> 00:18:18.420]  And it has no legitimate authority to interfere in your family's intimate health matters.
[00:18:19.544 --> 00:18:22.706]  Psychiatric diagnoses are inherently subjective.
[00:18:22.986 --> 00:18:26.048]  Well, you're a medical doctor, so I don't think you have a right to say anything.
[00:18:26.429 --> 00:18:26.829]  Shut up!
[00:18:27.509 --> 00:18:33.833]  And the drugs regularly prescribed produce serious side effects, especially in children developing brains.
[00:18:33.893 --> 00:18:44.139]  Well, their own reports, internal reports, now leaked, say that they know it brain damages them and causes them to commit mass murders and commit suicide, but just, you're a medical doctor, what do you have to say?
[00:18:44.159 --> 00:18:45.380]  Just shut up, Ron Paul!
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:46.581]  Just shut up!
[00:18:47.327 --> 00:18:53.330]  Now, the bottom line is that mental health issues are a matter for parents, children, and their doctors, not the government.
[00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:56.192]  Well, again, Congressman, tell the SWAT teams that.
[00:18:56.752 --> 00:19:04.016]  Unfortunately, however, the Mental Health Screening Initiative received funding from House and Senate appropriations in a 05 federal budget.
[00:19:04.456 --> 00:19:11.080]  This funding allows states to create or expand mental health screening programs with your tax dollars.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:15.562]  More importantly, the Commission recommends a broader federal program in the near future.
[00:19:16.494 --> 00:19:22.678]  Last fall, I introduced an amendment to eliminate any funding for the proposal in the year-end spending bill.
[00:19:23.059 --> 00:19:27.662]  Although the amendment failed, the response to my office was overwhelmingly and highly supportive.
[00:19:28.322 --> 00:19:31.885]  Yeah, they admitted that they got 2 million phone calls against this in the week it passed.
[00:19:32.685 --> 00:19:34.907]  But still, what was it, 87 people passed it?
[00:19:36.648 --> 00:19:38.289]  There's only a few Republicans voted against.
[00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:41.712]  The Democrats all voted with Lord Bush in the House and Senate.
[00:19:42.512 --> 00:19:44.714]  Of course, Limbaugh got on air and said the evil
[00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:46.530]  Liberals didn't want this.
[00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:47.791]  Pass it, pass it, pass it.
[00:19:47.811 --> 00:19:51.212]  Of course, he didn't tell you all the Democrats voted for it, but that's what he does.
[00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:52.253]  That's what his job is.
[00:19:53.433 --> 00:19:56.214]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:57.034 --> 00:19:58.995]  Tell you about your new brave new world.
[00:19:59.035 --> 00:19:59.555]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.476 --> 00:20:05.698]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[00:20:06.458 --> 00:20:14.681]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:20:15.285 --> 00:20:17.026]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.

[00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:31.211]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:20:31.791 --> 00:20:32.871]  And it's so easy.
[00:20:33.591 --> 00:20:35.592]  To learn, you simply listen.

[00:20:48.051 --> 00:20:48.311]  1-800-419-W.
[00:21:01.252 --> 00:21:02.233]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:02.313 --> 00:21:07.097]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:07.257 --> 00:21:15.064]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:15.344 --> 00:21:20.709]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.909 --> 00:21:27.895]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:28.135 --> 00:21:28.615]  We're good to go!
[00:21:49.924 --> 00:21:53.026]  Gold, on its own, has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:21:53.347 --> 00:21:55.848]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.

[00:21:57.890 --> 00:22:03.554]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.294 --> 00:22:09.938]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[00:22:09.978 --> 00:22:10.719]  Supreme Court.
[00:22:11.491 --> 00:22:15.794]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:19.436]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[00:22:20.437 --> 00:22:25.720]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.

[00:23:57.455 --> 00:24:04.600]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.622]  Alright, coming up, a bunch of news.
[00:24:07.883 --> 00:24:12.166]  And we've got Dr. Dennis Cuddy, expert on the New World Order and the globalists.
[00:24:12.739 --> 00:24:18.682]  Really one of the most intelligent people I know and most informed out there in the second hour.
[00:24:20.143 --> 00:24:21.984]  We're going to be going to Bill and Mike and J.R.
[00:24:22.024 --> 00:24:23.005]  and Kyle and others.
[00:24:24.265 --> 00:24:28.228]  But right now I want to get off to another subject just for a few minutes here.
[00:24:29.108 --> 00:24:30.409]  I'm not a Branch Davidian.
[00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:35.612]  George Pullian, who we're about to talk about, is not a Branch Davidian, neither is Stewart, who's calling in.
[00:24:36.272 --> 00:24:38.473]  We all got together, I guess back in 1999,
[00:24:41.491 --> 00:24:53.676]  Because, early 99, because they were going to bulldoze an old veteran's house, and they wouldn't let us fix it up, so in a city record 14 days, I put the call out to listeners, we built him a new house, and they bulldozed the old one.
[00:24:55.156 --> 00:25:00.998]  And then I was out at Waco covering what was happening there, and nobody had stood up for the Davidians.
[00:25:01.038 --> 00:25:07.721]  We'd all stood there and watched them murder the children, and they were trying to not kick the Davidians off their land, and I said, you know,
[00:25:08.925 --> 00:25:16.247]  We ought to build a memorial chapel out here for all those that died, including the police, the federal misguided thugs.
[00:25:16.367 --> 00:25:17.768]  There's even a plaque for them out there.
[00:25:18.088 --> 00:25:25.670]  So we built a church that seats 400 people in six months, you know, just working on the weekends, really about 35 days of work or so.
[00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:31.652]  And the guy who wrote up the plans for Joe Campana, the World War II vets, new house we built,
[00:25:32.398 --> 00:25:33.118]  Nice little house.
[00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:37.200]  The guy that wrote the plans for the memorial church at Mount Carmel.
[00:25:37.721 --> 00:25:39.942]  And who was there helping the whole time.
[00:25:41.102 --> 00:25:41.942]  It's George Pullian.
[00:25:42.883 --> 00:25:45.264]  And George, veteran himself, really nice guy.
[00:25:45.924 --> 00:25:48.265]  He went in and had surgery.
[00:25:48.305 --> 00:25:49.986]  He had his, what, spleen taken out.
[00:25:50.006 --> 00:25:53.208]  And then you know these hospitals, they got the superbugs in them.
[00:25:53.528 --> 00:25:55.909]  Got a superbug and it's like eating his whole body up.
[00:25:56.582 --> 00:25:58.363]  I'm basically shutting his whole body down.
[00:25:59.043 --> 00:26:01.684]  And yesterday there was doctors were saying he's going to die.
[00:26:01.724 --> 00:26:03.305]  He was in a coma on life support.
[00:26:03.705 --> 00:26:05.726]  Now they're saying 85% chance he's going to die.
[00:26:05.746 --> 00:26:06.687]  We've been praying for him.
[00:26:07.067 --> 00:26:08.688]  We ask you all to pray for George Pullian.
[00:26:09.288 --> 00:26:11.669]  You can see him in the video America, Waco for Waco.
[00:26:11.989 --> 00:26:14.190]  We played a clip of him last night on the TV show.
[00:26:14.591 --> 00:26:18.632]  That'll be in this week's news report on prisonplanet.tv.
[00:26:18.672 --> 00:26:20.473]  But George is really a great guy and
[00:26:23.550 --> 00:26:32.064]  It's sad to see him on the edge of death, but also we've been encouraging the family not to let the hospital
[00:26:32.879 --> 00:26:36.701]  Uh, you know, uh, take his life support off to see if he comes out of it.
[00:26:37.101 --> 00:26:41.924]  And now they've gone from yesterday saying he will die to, well, he might live now.
[00:26:42.024 --> 00:26:43.204]  So that's encouraging.
[00:26:43.584 --> 00:26:53.769]  And joining us is Stuart, good friend of mine, one of the fellows of construction, uh, company guy who was out there on Joe Campana, the Veterans House, and then on the Branch Davidian Memorial Church.
[00:26:54.150 --> 00:26:55.470]  He's been talking to the family a lot.
[00:26:55.610 --> 00:26:56.811]  Uh, Stuart, what's going on?
[00:26:57.580 --> 00:26:59.943]  Well, I just thank you, Alex, for taking the call.
[00:26:59.983 --> 00:27:00.684]  I appreciate it.
[00:27:00.964 --> 00:27:04.768]  And George is on live support.
[00:27:05.028 --> 00:27:06.670]  He's all wired up.
[00:27:06.930 --> 00:27:10.154]  Evidently, the stupor bug is shutting down his whole system, like you said.
[00:27:11.776 --> 00:27:14.078]  They're saying that he's probably not going to make it.
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:17.322]  But yesterday it was he's not going to make it.
[00:27:17.843 --> 00:27:18.043]  Right.
[00:27:18.618 --> 00:27:24.679]  Yeah, they were talking about this morning at 8 o'clock, flipping the switch and turning off his life support.
[00:27:25.019 --> 00:27:27.020]  Which, I'm told he's still got brainwaves.
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:27.940]  That's ridiculous.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:29.500]  He can come out of this.
[00:27:29.541 --> 00:27:33.982]  My uncle was in a coma with brain-dead brainwaves for six weeks.
[00:27:34.502 --> 00:27:38.623]  And, you know, today he's got two children, happily married, and out there riding a horse.
[00:27:38.683 --> 00:27:40.283]  He's probably riding the fence line right now.
[00:27:41.112 --> 00:27:44.674]  Yeah, and you know, there's people from all over the country.
[00:27:45.054 --> 00:27:49.116]  Thousands of people came to help rebuild the Branch Davidian Church.
[00:27:51.237 --> 00:28:08.606]  Gosh, all of you that are out there, I'm not saying hello to you, I'm the guy with the little Rottweiler puppy, but George is a hero, and we need this guy here, and we really need, I'm just really requesting everybody just really spend some time just praying for him.
[00:28:09.486 --> 00:28:10.667]  Uh, that he pulls through this.
[00:28:10.707 --> 00:28:11.427]  We need him here.
[00:28:11.447 --> 00:28:14.049]  The planet's a better place with a guy like George William here.
[00:28:15.210 --> 00:28:23.095]  Well, I know I said a prayer, uh, on the TV and also said one last night privately, but we all should all pray for George.
[00:28:23.115 --> 00:28:23.675]  He's a good guy.
[00:28:24.256 --> 00:28:25.256]  Yeah, he's a great guy.
[00:28:25.517 --> 00:28:28.418]  And, uh, you know, I know that there's massive things going on.
[00:28:28.438 --> 00:28:29.539]  You're doing a great show.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.722]  We could stop for a couple minutes and just, just put a shout out to the
[00:28:34.252 --> 00:28:36.233]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[00:28:36.393 --> 00:28:38.173]  And which hospital is she in right now?
[00:28:38.193 --> 00:28:44.715]  She's in Seton on I-35 in the middle of Central Austin.
[00:28:44.916 --> 00:28:45.696]  In ICU.
[00:28:47.496 --> 00:28:50.637]  And the whole family's here now.
[00:28:51.138 --> 00:28:54.679]  And they're, you know, gathered around trying to figure out what to do and all that.
[00:28:54.719 --> 00:28:57.480]  So I'm trying to, you know, encourage them to keep fighting.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.860]  Are you at the hospital?
[00:28:59.460 --> 00:29:01.481]  No, right now I'm back at my house.
[00:29:03.829 --> 00:29:08.010]  Well, I need to go by and see George, but I guess that'd probably get in the way.
[00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:13.832]  Well, you know, we can meet up there at noon or so, but whatever you want to do.
[00:29:13.852 --> 00:29:16.592]  Well, if I can't meet you at noon, I'm going to be on the radio.
[00:29:17.693 --> 00:29:19.773]  Oh yeah, that's right, so too.
[00:29:20.113 --> 00:29:30.536]  Well, we should all pray for George, and Stuart, I know that you've been really concerned about this, and I appreciate you notifying me of this yesterday.
[00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:31.780]  Okay.
[00:29:32.281 --> 00:29:33.041]  Take care, my friend.
[00:29:33.061 --> 00:29:33.602]  All right, thank you.
[00:29:33.682 --> 00:29:33.942]  Bye-bye.
[00:29:34.142 --> 00:29:34.823]  Bye-bye, Stuart.
[00:29:34.843 --> 00:29:41.327]  All right, we'll come back, talk to Bill, Mike, J.R., Kyle, and others, cover a bunch of news, talk more about the new Freedom Initiative.
[00:29:41.708 --> 00:29:49.193]  Your new freedom, at gunpoint, they said they'll come take your children at gunpoint for forced psychological testing, and they've already funded it.
[00:29:51.675 --> 00:29:52.596]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.076 --> 00:29:54.697]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.598 --> 00:29:58.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.617 --> 00:30:09.920]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.961]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[00:30:15.181 --> 00:30:19.043]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.

[00:30:29.648 --> 00:30:38.213]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:30:38.553 --> 00:30:44.857]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[00:32:01.289 --> 00:32:04.972]  You've heard about PODS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:32:05.272 --> 00:32:09.575]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?

[00:32:54.331 --> 00:32:58.972]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use Bio-Ox family of products.
[00:33:01.842 --> 00:33:07.488]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.971 --> 00:33:22.121]  All over television the last few days they were showing a captured Special Forces American soldier held by the evil insurgents in Iraq.
[00:33:22.762 --> 00:33:24.103]  Turned out it was a toy.
[00:33:24.623 --> 00:33:27.186]  A toy sold at US military bases in the Middle East.
[00:33:28.473 --> 00:33:29.874]  It's a little plastic G.I.
[00:33:29.914 --> 00:33:32.454]  Joe style toy, a little plastic gun aimed at him.
[00:33:33.635 --> 00:33:40.697]  And last year, remember, a 20 year old computer programmer did a fake beheading in his garage.
[00:33:41.618 --> 00:33:46.199]  And then it was announced to the world that it was a real beheading and it was on the news.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:51.861]  And the point in this is that's how easy it is to hoax people.
[00:33:52.902 --> 00:33:56.803]  I mean, when I first looked at this picture, this morning,
[00:33:57.512 --> 00:34:00.435]  I was like, how could anybody not know that's a toy?
[00:34:01.276 --> 00:34:02.478]  I mean, it's a toy!
[00:34:03.158 --> 00:34:05.421]  With a little plastic M16 aimed at it.
[00:34:07.884 --> 00:34:09.806]  Ugh, I mean, it's just crazy.
[00:34:10.607 --> 00:34:13.050]  Are people, like, getting dumber and dumber or something?
[00:34:14.171 --> 00:34:16.834]  But, see, you can con the general public with things like that.
[00:34:17.435 --> 00:34:19.417]  Well, it's just like the Nick Berg beheading.
[00:34:20.385 --> 00:34:22.607]  Or the Fat Bin Laden.
[00:34:22.627 --> 00:34:23.187]  Remember that?
[00:34:23.628 --> 00:34:30.413]  Months after 9-11 there's this Fat Bin Laden in a dark room who suddenly had gained 150 pounds and had a nose twice the size.
[00:34:31.093 --> 00:34:32.134]  Then they did voice print.
[00:34:32.154 --> 00:34:34.256]  They took real audio of the real Bin Laden.
[00:34:34.276 --> 00:34:35.677]  They had a voice print key with it.
[00:34:36.097 --> 00:34:38.078]  And then tried to run the other Bin Laden's voice through it.
[00:34:38.098 --> 00:34:39.660]  It wasn't even close.
[00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:42.141]  And those voice prints were 100%.
[00:34:42.722 --> 00:34:45.704]  And then they even had linguists and experts listen to it.
[00:34:45.744 --> 00:34:47.986]  It wasn't even somebody with a Saudi Arabian accent.
[00:34:48.366 --> 00:34:49.527]  It was totally fake!
[00:34:50.891 --> 00:34:52.412]  You don't like the Nick Berg tape?
[00:34:52.452 --> 00:34:53.313]  I mean, that's real.
[00:34:53.873 --> 00:35:00.958]  Well, yeah, it's real in that he was grabbed by the FBI, held for 13 days, released directly to Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:00.978 --> 00:35:02.479]  That's BBC Associated Press.
[00:35:02.899 --> 00:35:13.926]  Al-Syeda chops his head off in the same rooms that were videotaped at Abu Ghraib with the same yellow walls, the same chairs, even with the same grease smears on them.
[00:35:14.606 --> 00:35:19.269]  Like we're not going to notice this with fat guys standing around him.
[00:35:21.252 --> 00:35:25.022]  With two legs, the supposed al-Qaeda chief that's cutting his head off only has one leg.
[00:35:25.744 --> 00:35:27.068]  But not in this!
[00:35:27.088 --> 00:35:28.792]  We're not supposed to notice all this!
[00:35:29.409 --> 00:35:30.430]  We're supposed to be stupid.
[00:35:30.450 --> 00:35:51.421]  It was like that aid lady who has been in Iraq for 20 years, married to an Iraqi, against the occupation, and then it's reported in the mainstream news that 15 men in Iraqi military police uniforms, led by two Anglo men, come grab her, then they go shoot her in the head, and Al-Syiada takes credit.
[00:35:51.521 --> 00:35:57.704]  I mean, it's openly admitted that Westerners come arrest her, and then blow her head off, and, oh, see, Al-Qaeda did it!
[00:35:58.467 --> 00:36:00.248]  You see, you can fool people with a toy.
[00:36:00.649 --> 00:36:04.031]  You can fool them with some kid in a garage doing a mock head chopping.
[00:36:04.432 --> 00:36:05.713]  You know, people buy this stuff.
[00:36:05.753 --> 00:36:07.974]  And we've tracked most of these real beheading videos.
[00:36:08.254 --> 00:36:11.057]  They're uploaded from government servers in Houston.
[00:36:11.717 --> 00:36:14.579]  Or private corporations in L.A.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.222]  Or from the state in Arkansas.
[00:36:19.223 --> 00:36:22.205]  Being tracked directly back to the U.S.
[00:36:22.265 --> 00:36:22.685]  government.
[00:36:23.886 --> 00:36:25.147]  Point of origination.
[00:36:25.668 --> 00:36:27.189]  Uploaded from secure servers.
[00:36:29.521 --> 00:36:33.543]  It just blows my mind how easy it is to con people.
[00:36:35.925 --> 00:36:36.645]  It's amazing.
[00:36:36.685 --> 00:36:37.846]  So just start thinking for yourselves.
[00:36:37.866 --> 00:36:38.746]  Let's take some calls.
[00:36:38.766 --> 00:36:40.047]  I'm going to plunge into the news.
[00:36:40.087 --> 00:36:41.888]  There's just so much of it here that's important.
[00:36:42.268 --> 00:36:43.149]  Like supermarkets.
[00:36:43.189 --> 00:36:44.470]  Let your fingers do the walking.
[00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:45.570]  Do the paying.
[00:36:46.030 --> 00:36:46.951]  Bill in Texas.
[00:36:47.011 --> 00:36:47.771]  Bill, go ahead.
[00:36:48.192 --> 00:36:48.892]  Yes, okay.
[00:36:48.912 --> 00:36:49.332]  Real quick.
[00:36:49.392 --> 00:36:50.093]  It's very important.
[00:36:50.233 --> 00:36:51.534]  This is about the money in the Pentagon.
[00:36:52.214 --> 00:36:53.655]  My wife's dead and my son's dead.
[00:36:53.715 --> 00:36:54.575]  It's an incredible story.
[00:36:54.595 --> 00:36:55.696]  I've got a package to send you.
[00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:59.313]  William Sessions knows all about the money he took my father-in law down.
[00:36:59.333 --> 00:37:00.794]  Walter R. Jensen from IBM.
[00:37:01.315 --> 00:37:02.776]  He went to Electronic Data Systems.
[00:37:02.796 --> 00:37:03.997]  All right, let me go real quick on this.
[00:37:04.477 --> 00:37:05.878]  My name is William Patrick Jennings.
[00:37:05.958 --> 00:37:06.819]  I'm 58 years old.
[00:37:06.839 --> 00:37:10.862]  I'm a security guard ex-construction worker, ex-marine paratrooper, radio operator, former server.
[00:37:11.082 --> 00:37:11.842]  This will come in later.
[00:37:12.663 --> 00:37:15.965]  Now, Walter Jensen, 228 Pine Lake Village, Florida.
[00:37:16.386 --> 00:37:18.127]  He was with IBM for 30 years, all right?
[00:37:18.687 --> 00:37:22.010]  They had, of course, the computer you have today is because they put it together.
[00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:23.891]  Now, what happened?
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.481]  When Ross Perot got involved in Electronic Data Systems, they had the software.
[00:37:28.521 --> 00:37:31.222]  Now in 1989, William Session knows it because he took them down in 1989.
[00:37:31.262 --> 00:37:33.263]  Well first off, just tell me what you're talking about.
[00:37:33.483 --> 00:37:34.864]  Okay, the money in the Pentagon.
[00:37:35.544 --> 00:37:37.125]  It went through Electronic Data Systems.
[00:37:37.725 --> 00:37:40.666]  Now you're talking about the $2.4 trillion that's missing now?
[00:37:40.726 --> 00:37:41.646]  Yes sir, yes sir.
[00:37:41.806 --> 00:37:46.908]  What happened there sir, the first time the data between the Pentagon and their contractors was controlled, it was IBM.
[00:37:47.328 --> 00:37:48.689]  That's called Electronic Data Systems.
[00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:50.370]  Ross Perot was with IBM.
[00:37:50.770 --> 00:37:52.570]  I follow Walter Johnson was with IBM.
[00:37:52.690 --> 00:37:54.111]  Yeah, I know, and he sold EDS.
[00:37:55.153 --> 00:37:56.754]  Yes, anyway, that's how they stole the money.
[00:37:56.774 --> 00:38:02.636]  In 1989, a DA agent told me in Houston they found the numbers to the Pentagon at Walter's house in Florida.
[00:38:03.477 --> 00:38:07.378]  In 1992, when Desert Storm started, they were X-raying the grounds in Connecticut in his old house.
[00:38:07.418 --> 00:38:08.419]  He sold that to an IBMer.
[00:38:08.839 --> 00:38:09.619]  This is on record.
[00:38:10.319 --> 00:38:17.022]  Bill Dershoek was a federal agent that was involved for 25 years with my father-in-law, and he committed suicide here in San Antonio seven years ago.
[00:38:17.602 --> 00:38:18.263]  Bill Dershoek.
[00:38:19.283 --> 00:38:19.523]  Okay?
[00:38:20.203 --> 00:38:23.044]  Now, they've hushed this thing up because of damage control for the order.
[00:38:23.345 --> 00:38:24.345]  He was a high-ranking Mason.
[00:38:24.986 --> 00:38:26.346]  I'll tell you quick how I got involved in it.
[00:38:27.227 --> 00:38:28.247]  And here's what happened.
[00:38:28.287 --> 00:38:29.187]  He adopted a girl in 1960.
[00:38:29.747 --> 00:38:31.888]  She was 13 years old and she was raped.
[00:38:31.948 --> 00:38:32.388]  He raped her.
[00:38:32.908 --> 00:38:33.809]  The CIA and the FBI did.
[00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:34.329]  You know what?
[00:38:34.409 --> 00:38:35.569]  I think that's enough, sir.
[00:38:36.089 --> 00:38:36.770]  Here's the problem.
[00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:45.152]  I'm not just going to have somebody call up and just start spewing a bunch of names and a bunch of stuff and, uh, thanks for the call, Bill.
[00:38:45.572 --> 00:38:51.694]  You want to write some of this stuff down, send me a news article, send me a file, lay out your case, then I might cover it.
[00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:56.761]  But, again, I don't know some of the names you're mentioning, some of the things you're saying.
[00:38:57.861 --> 00:38:59.602]  My broadcast is not the place for this.
[00:39:00.002 --> 00:39:01.903]  Thank you.
[00:39:02.903 --> 00:39:07.425]  Now, 1.2 trillion dollars was missing from 1993 to 2003.
[00:39:07.525 --> 00:39:10.826]  In ten years, they admit, 1.2 trillion missing.
[00:39:10.866 --> 00:39:12.987]  One trillion
[00:39:19.793 --> 00:39:23.518]  Two hundred billion dollars!
[00:39:24.519 --> 00:39:26.381]  Now, I've been saying that number since I learned of it in 2003.
[00:39:26.461 --> 00:39:38.256]  Well, I came across a CBS News report, then I found the Congressional Budget Office reports two weeks ago when I was doing research for Marshall Law, the new film I'm making.
[00:39:40.482 --> 00:39:51.967]  And I found a press conference given about six months ago by Rumsfeld, I wasn't even aware of this, where he admitted, he just said, yeah, 2.4 trillion is missing now, so it's accelerated.
[00:39:52.788 --> 00:39:56.029]  It was 1.2 trillion in 10 years, up to 2003.
[00:39:56.809 --> 00:40:02.632]  Now in the last year and a half, now almost two years, it has doubled in
[00:40:06.033 --> 00:40:07.175]  In two-tenths of the time.
[00:40:07.735 --> 00:40:16.867]  I mean, in two years, as much stealing has gone on as went on under Bill Clinton and then the first three years of Lord Bush's watch.
[00:40:20.096 --> 00:40:22.197]  2.4 trillion, and it's a minor story.
[00:40:22.237 --> 00:40:24.799]  I found four or five articles about it, and I just admit it.
[00:40:24.839 --> 00:40:25.500]  Yeah, it's missing.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:26.721]  Nothing's going to be investigated.
[00:40:27.001 --> 00:40:27.441]  So what?
[00:40:27.902 --> 00:40:36.949]  Then they'll bust a few army captains or, you know, generals who are caught buying computers and Palm Pilots en masse and then selling them out the back of their Winnebago.
[00:40:36.969 --> 00:40:38.350]  I mean, stuff like that.
[00:40:38.470 --> 00:40:40.852]  And then that just accounts for a few billion dollars a year.
[00:40:40.872 --> 00:40:43.514]  You know, classic waste, fraud, and abuse.
[00:40:44.511 --> 00:40:47.754]  People selling machine guns out the back, or whatever.
[00:40:47.794 --> 00:40:48.834]  That's very small.
[00:40:48.894 --> 00:40:50.856]  It is massive, systematic.
[00:40:50.896 --> 00:40:52.918]  And yes, I know about EDS and Ross Perot.
[00:40:54.399 --> 00:41:00.764]  Ross Perot made his money off the government, selling his EDS system first off for implementing welfare payments in New York.
[00:41:00.844 --> 00:41:03.726]  I know he did end up selling it to IBM.
[00:41:03.806 --> 00:41:10.191]  I know IBM, from my studies, is the most evil, most powerful corporation in the world.
[00:41:10.411 --> 00:41:11.672]  It's numero uno.
[00:41:13.468 --> 00:41:19.354]  You know, as you go with classical corporations, obviously the private central banks are the biggest, but it's all owned by the same people.
[00:41:19.875 --> 00:41:23.918]  Top bohemian grovers, Mr. Watson, we got photos of him with the Nazis.
[00:41:24.219 --> 00:41:29.824]  They had IBM technicians there running the death camps, running the machines, running the tabulators.
[00:41:30.405 --> 00:41:37.692]  They would measure how much fat you had, how old you were, put it into the computer, decide whether to kill you on the spot or use you for slave labor.
[00:41:38.832 --> 00:41:45.637]  The tattoos were the code numbers to be issued and entered into the computers of the international business machine.
[00:41:47.318 --> 00:41:52.202]  I know IBM is involved in the human genome, the applied digital solutions, the implantable chips.
[00:41:52.242 --> 00:41:55.404]  I mean, their tentacles pop up everywhere.
[00:41:55.424 --> 00:42:00.688]  I mean, they got their tentacles out puppeteering almost everything.
[00:42:01.949 --> 00:42:05.672]  And they literally just traffic in control.
[00:42:08.507 --> 00:42:09.808]  I don't know particularly.
[00:42:09.868 --> 00:42:14.030]  I know EDS runs a lot of the systems for the government, the Pentagon, hence IBM.
[00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.731]  And I mean, this is grand larceny, folks.
[00:42:18.372 --> 00:42:19.292]  Grand larceny.
[00:42:19.752 --> 00:42:21.033]  Just again, they calmly report.
[00:42:22.474 --> 00:42:32.418]  You hear about $25 billion or something with Enron, or $10 billion with WorldCom, or $250 million with Tyco, or Martin Stewart and $3 million.
[00:42:32.638 --> 00:42:33.559]  I mean, so what?
[00:42:33.639 --> 00:42:34.679]  That is nothing.
[00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.080]  That isn't even
[00:42:37.412 --> 00:42:40.654]  That's a thimble compared to a washtub, people.
[00:42:40.674 --> 00:42:45.297]  I mean, we're talking 2.4 trillion now, and it's just, yeah, it's missing.
[00:42:45.617 --> 00:42:46.477]  What you gonna do?
[00:42:46.758 --> 00:42:55.183]  We've militarized the police, we've got machine guns, we've got the cameras going up, uh, we've, uh, you know, we've got the prisons built for you and your family.
[00:42:55.523 --> 00:42:56.103]  Shut up!
[00:42:56.403 --> 00:42:59.125]  Yeah, we took the money, and what are you gonna do about it?
[00:42:59.925 --> 00:43:00.986]  You understand us?
[00:43:01.306 --> 00:43:04.208]  We're keeping you safe from Al-Qaeda, so shut up!
[00:43:05.168 --> 00:43:06.189]  Now, that's the attitude.
[00:43:06.649 --> 00:43:08.850]  And you're going, well, let them steal the money.
[00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:10.651]  I mean, let whoever's got it have it.
[00:43:10.711 --> 00:43:12.953]  I mean, you know, shut up!
[00:43:14.174 --> 00:43:18.897]  Don't you understand that if they get away with that, they're going to get away with taking your pension funds.
[00:43:18.917 --> 00:43:20.978]  They're going to get away with looting Social Security.
[00:43:21.318 --> 00:43:33.606]  Don't you understand that the grand larceny, the galactic level, the galaxy of corruption, the gargantuan,
[00:43:36.383 --> 00:43:42.587]  Universal size, and there's no way to describe this, of the just pell-mell open, it's legal theft.
[00:43:42.607 --> 00:43:48.391]  I mean, they've said the White House is above the law, all law flows from them, and they're just openly announcing it, and it's just what you're going to do.
[00:43:50.552 --> 00:43:52.954]  And that's why they want this control grid.
[00:43:53.014 --> 00:43:57.337]  Two years ago, they changed the rules where you no longer own your private pension funds.
[00:43:57.717 --> 00:44:02.240]  They changed the pension fund rules, it was in the news, they said it was a wonderful new reform,
[00:44:03.047 --> 00:44:09.073]  And they said that now companies, uh, it isn't illegal for them to take your pension fund because, well, it's really their money, they can do with it what they want.
[00:44:10.214 --> 00:44:15.598]  And then now you start seeing pension funds fail, and looting of pension funds, and that's all going on right now, too.
[00:44:16.299 --> 00:44:19.402]  So just keep thinking it's all cute and funny and everything's fine.
[00:44:19.682 --> 00:44:20.483]  Okay, fine!
[00:44:24.326 --> 00:44:24.907]  Oh, man.
[00:44:25.087 --> 00:44:26.108]  Mike in Colorado.
[00:44:26.148 --> 00:44:27.069]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[00:44:27.569 --> 00:44:28.350]  World ID card.
[00:44:29.406 --> 00:44:30.527]  Yes, World ID Card.
[00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:31.568]  Thank you for calling about it.
[00:44:31.628 --> 00:44:34.810]  Now, the new legislation, they passed National ID Card a month and a half ago.
[00:44:35.170 --> 00:44:37.412]  Now they've introduced a Pan-American Card.
[00:44:37.692 --> 00:44:38.673]  It'll all be unified.
[00:44:38.693 --> 00:44:39.353]  That's in the new bill.
[00:44:39.973 --> 00:44:42.875]  Is it not enough that we get issued Social Security Cards?
[00:44:42.976 --> 00:44:47.038]  I know that's not a form of ID, even though some places require it.
[00:44:47.178 --> 00:44:50.181]  Well, the card used to say not to be used for personal identification.
[00:44:50.201 --> 00:44:51.562]  My card says exactly that.
[00:44:51.922 --> 00:44:55.604]  But, but, but, but, forget the 1986 Privacy Act.
[00:44:56.105 --> 00:44:57.886]  Then all the other laws say you have to.
[00:44:58.777 --> 00:45:04.741]  And is it not enough that we had the driver's licenses at first and then they turned to the credit card driver's licenses?
[00:45:05.642 --> 00:45:10.746]  And you also had, you know, some people have passports that the government issued.
[00:45:10.886 --> 00:45:13.488]  I mean, just ID after ID after ID.
[00:45:15.202 --> 00:45:19.264]  I'm surprised they don't just skip it all and go right to mandatory microchipping.
[00:45:19.504 --> 00:45:21.405]  Well, that's next after the nuke goes off.
[00:45:21.865 --> 00:45:27.328]  We never thought we'd say this, but as Andy Rooney said, if everybody had a chip, we'd know who the good people were.
[00:45:27.388 --> 00:45:28.288]  It's time, folks.
[00:45:28.709 --> 00:45:30.630]  You're not for Al-Qaeda, are you?
[00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:32.190]  I think that they're going to make it...
[00:45:33.431 --> 00:45:38.254]  At first, voluntary, then mandatory, and then if you don't take it, they'll either kill you or put you in prison.
[00:45:38.654 --> 00:45:40.696]  Well, that's already how it is.
[00:45:40.896 --> 00:45:42.537]  Oh, you want to get into the VIP section?
[00:45:42.577 --> 00:45:48.961]  Gotta have the chip from Florida to California, from England to Barcelona to Spain.
[00:45:49.941 --> 00:45:51.202]  It's happening everywhere.
[00:45:51.402 --> 00:45:52.903]  And oh, you want to be in the military?
[00:45:52.943 --> 00:45:53.624]  You gotta take it.
[00:45:53.944 --> 00:45:55.144]  Or oh, you want to be a fire pilot?
[00:45:55.165 --> 00:45:55.585]  You gotta take it.
[00:45:55.605 --> 00:45:57.826]  Or oh, you want the hospital care?
[00:45:57.866 --> 00:45:58.527]  You gotta take it.
[00:45:58.727 --> 00:46:00.668]  This is already all being proposed.
[00:46:01.394 --> 00:46:02.214]  Oh, you're a prisoner?
[00:46:02.254 --> 00:46:03.395]  Gotta take it.
[00:46:03.995 --> 00:46:13.760]  It's just a blueprint of... sometimes I think that these one-worlders are intentionally making some of the prophecies and revelations come true, using it as a script.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.181]  Well, they are!
[00:46:16.441 --> 00:46:17.502]  They think it's a script.
[00:46:17.602 --> 00:46:18.162]  They laugh.
[00:46:18.242 --> 00:46:19.102]  I've talked to globalists.
[00:46:19.382 --> 00:46:23.765]  They laugh and go, yeah, we're using the script you people believe in, but see, that's their own delusion.
[00:46:24.045 --> 00:46:25.205]  That's their own deception.
[00:46:26.106 --> 00:46:26.606]  You see, they...
[00:46:27.737 --> 00:46:28.017]  Go ahead.
[00:46:28.437 --> 00:46:30.179]  I mean, no, they're Luciferians.
[00:46:30.459 --> 00:46:31.059]  That's admitted.
[00:46:31.139 --> 00:46:32.300]  It's all over the news, folks.
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.341]  They're members of these death orders.
[00:46:35.041 --> 00:46:38.524]  But to them, and then they'll still tell you, though, oh, but God isn't real.
[00:46:38.964 --> 00:46:42.906]  You know, we're really God, and yeah, we're creating this, but only because it's a good idea.
[00:46:43.266 --> 00:46:47.689]  Yeah, Jesus offends people, but sacrificial human effigies don't.
[00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:49.550]  Well, that's right.
[00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:54.954]  You know, we've got to take the Ten Commandments out, but it's okay that our president is a member of the Order of Death.
[00:46:54.974 --> 00:46:55.514]  Thanks for the call.
[00:46:56.235 --> 00:46:57.116]  Very interesting points.
[00:46:57.156 --> 00:46:57.976]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[00:46:58.577 --> 00:46:59.417]  Uh, J.R.
[00:46:59.517 --> 00:47:00.118]  in Texas.
[00:47:00.678 --> 00:47:01.138]  Hello, Alex.
[00:47:01.479 --> 00:47:02.699]  J.R., how's Sue Ellen?
[00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.100]  Sue Ellen's doing great, man.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:05.441]  Okay, that's a joke.
[00:47:05.982 --> 00:47:06.782]  A TV show.
[00:47:07.162 --> 00:47:07.523]  What's up?
[00:47:07.803 --> 00:47:16.809]  Hey, Alex, I noticed something recently on that report you did about a year ago about the World Trade Center Building 7.
[00:47:17.429 --> 00:47:17.709]  Yes.
[00:47:18.250 --> 00:47:21.612]  Okay, on the footage of CBS with Dan Rather,
[00:47:22.944 --> 00:47:26.527]  You can see that at about 22 minutes and 30 seconds in that report.
[00:47:27.828 --> 00:47:39.556]  You can actually see when the east side rooftop penthouse of Building 7 disintegrates almost 10 seconds before any collapse actually begins on Building 7?
[00:47:39.796 --> 00:47:43.739]  No, the first thing they do, and this is called the wedge,
[00:47:44.964 --> 00:48:01.250]  So a building in a controlled demolition falls in on itself, you blow a usually off-center column, so that falls first, the building doesn't fall, and then when you start blowing the other columns, it falls into the place where it's already lost support.
[00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:04.031]  It's a science.
[00:48:04.151 --> 00:48:05.051]  Very hard to do.
[00:48:05.432 --> 00:48:11.494]  And then in the new film I'm making, I show other controlled demolitions of Las Vegas hotels and stuff, and we show the wedge.
[00:48:11.594 --> 00:48:14.535]  We show how they blow that key column first.
[00:48:15.017 --> 00:48:22.161]  Oh yeah, but that penthouse that collapses first was added on later, after the building was completed in the 80s.
[00:48:22.862 --> 00:48:28.665]  Well, the reason you see that... Actually, that's the air conditioning complex.
[00:48:28.705 --> 00:48:32.307]  The reason you see that fall in first is because that's what's under that main support pillar.
[00:48:32.908 --> 00:48:33.608]  Oh, okay, okay.
[00:48:34.609 --> 00:48:42.874]  I've been having a lot of good luck waking up people here in my community, and I've been sending out copies of your documentaries to the
[00:48:43.669 --> 00:48:46.832]  The Mexican media, you know, in Mexico City and here locally.
[00:48:47.512 --> 00:48:53.837]  And people on the street are, you know, they're interested and they're curious about finding out about what's going on.
[00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:56.880]  I mean, I think most people are ready to wake up, you know.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:49:05.647]  Well, yeah, no, I've found that people in third world countries and in just foreign countries, period, go, oh, of course, your government carried out the attacks.
[00:49:05.807 --> 00:49:06.688]  Oh, of course, yes.
[00:49:07.368 --> 00:49:10.271]  It's just some Americans that have trouble waking up to it.
[00:49:11.192 --> 00:49:17.476]  I know, but if you get a chance Alex, check that footage out again because that's very revealing.
[00:49:18.277 --> 00:49:20.118]  It's actually going to be in the new film.
[00:49:20.178 --> 00:49:21.559]  Alright man, that's great!
[00:49:21.579 --> 00:49:24.101]  That's awesome.
[00:49:24.461 --> 00:49:26.723]  I can't wait to see the new documentary you're making.
[00:49:28.044 --> 00:49:29.945]  Well, we're fighting to get it out.
[00:49:30.045 --> 00:49:32.107]  I'm working 18 hours a day to get it done.
[00:49:32.487 --> 00:49:33.308]  Well, good job, Alex.
[00:49:33.348 --> 00:49:36.010]  I appreciate everything you're doing, and thank you so much for waking me up.
[00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.731]  I appreciate your call.
[00:49:37.771 --> 00:49:38.892]  Good to hear from you, JR.
[00:49:39.912 --> 00:49:49.819]  Yeah, you can watch my Building 7 analysis that I did, I don't know, over a year ago on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:49:49.879 --> 00:49:55.383]  It's one of the free clips, like a 30-minute analysis that I did of the whole thing, playing the clips and going over it.
[00:49:55.996 --> 00:49:59.021]  You can go watch all that and hopefully spread it around to people.
[00:49:59.581 --> 00:50:01.965]  Just type Alex Jones WTC7 in.
[00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:04.449]  You should get our WTC7 page.
[00:50:04.489 --> 00:50:05.871]  Just type that in the search engine.
[00:50:06.532 --> 00:50:09.756]  Alex Jones or Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:50:09.777 --> 00:50:11.299]  PrisonPlanet.com has the biggest stuff.
[00:50:12.426 --> 00:50:14.667]  Biggest WTC7 section that we've built.
[00:50:15.247 --> 00:50:17.788]  There's even bigger ones out there on the web that came after.
[00:50:17.808 --> 00:50:21.609]  I'm glad folks, I mean there's like hundreds of websites focusing on it now.
[00:50:21.989 --> 00:50:23.669]  And see, that's where our power comes in.
[00:50:24.269 --> 00:50:26.650]  I can plant the seeds, you can plant seeds and do this too.
[00:50:27.450 --> 00:50:29.351]  I'm quite a Johnny Appleseed here.
[00:50:29.811 --> 00:50:37.613]  I've planted millions of seeds and I've seen millions of them sprout and some of them grow up into big old trees, a lot bigger than I am.
[00:50:38.453 --> 00:50:40.474]  And that's a great thing.
[00:50:41.348 --> 00:50:44.612]  To be the father of many leaders.
[00:50:44.973 --> 00:50:48.517]  But I'm the son of leaders that came before me and that's how it works.
[00:50:49.238 --> 00:50:52.042]  As we replicate the cure to the New World Order.
[00:50:53.023 --> 00:50:55.987]  As the cure to the disease spreads.
[00:50:56.047 --> 00:50:57.008]  As we replicate.
[00:50:57.428 --> 00:50:59.291]  As our victory comes into view.
[00:51:02.364 --> 00:51:09.774]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.034 --> 00:51:14.760]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:20.648]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.868 --> 00:51:32.777]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash, the cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.797 --> 00:51:37.301]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.501 --> 00:51:40.003]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.243 --> 00:51:46.408]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional
[00:51:46.408 --> 00:51:47.209]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.488 --> 00:52:03.108]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.248 --> 00:52:07.389]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.489 --> 00:52:10.370]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.450 --> 00:52:17.151]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.331 --> 00:52:20.352]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.552 --> 00:52:22.952]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:23.072 --> 00:52:30.954]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:52:31.274 --> 00:52:42.542]  Markazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[00:52:42.702 --> 00:52:50.468]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of blank Berkey purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:54:14.474 --> 00:54:16.515]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy is coming up.
[00:54:16.935 --> 00:54:18.755]  Believe me, I've talked to a lot of people.
[00:54:19.495 --> 00:54:27.556]  But when it comes to real, basic research, knowing the big, major plan, the overview, it is Dr. Cuddy.
[00:54:28.697 --> 00:54:30.477]  And that's coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:32.719 --> 00:54:35.986]  And of course we'll continue with your phone calls just briefly before I go any further.
[00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:38.310]  I have made 11 films.
[00:54:41.033 --> 00:54:43.114]  And they're all excellent, and they're indescribable.
[00:54:43.154 --> 00:54:45.354]  There's too much in each film to go over all of it.
[00:54:45.394 --> 00:54:47.155]  I mean, take Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:54:47.515 --> 00:55:07.621]  What the New World Order is, who the neocons are, the fake left-right paradigm, how both parties are controlled, dozens of examples of government-sponsored terrorism, Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, people being arrested for no reason, the foreign troops, the implantable microchips, the forced inoculation, Building 7.
[00:55:08.781 --> 00:55:10.722]  It's two hours, forty-four minutes long.
[00:55:11.477 --> 00:55:13.118]  It's really three or four films in one.
[00:55:13.599 --> 00:55:19.184]  I mean, just watching this one film, you'll get a basic understanding.
[00:55:19.204 --> 00:55:25.409]  I mean, you'll know more than most political scientists who are all off in their little, you know, false realities.
[00:55:26.152 --> 00:55:27.212]  You need to have that film.
[00:55:27.232 --> 00:55:31.893]  You need to have Matrix of Evil with Ron Paul saying those that want world government run Washington.
[00:55:32.253 --> 00:55:34.174]  You know, that's 30 seconds of the two-hour film.
[00:55:34.734 --> 00:55:36.394]  It's just so jam-packed.
[00:55:36.434 --> 00:55:51.697]  You need to have 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny, the preeminent 9-11 film that gives you the history of government-sponsored terror and covers Oklahoma City, the first World Trade Center, 9-11, the police state, Masters of Terror, my 9-11 film that mainly just focuses on 9-11 for two hours.
[00:55:52.097 --> 00:55:52.917]  These are all great
[00:55:53.678 --> 00:55:57.602]  Great videos, great books we have, other videos and other offers we carry.

[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.041]  Don't wait.
[00:56:17.081 --> 00:56:18.222]  Don't procrastinate.
[00:56:18.242 --> 00:56:19.463]  Here's that number again.
[00:56:19.643 --> 00:56:19.984]  Triple 8.
[00:56:20.024 --> 00:56:20.164]  253-3139.

[00:56:46.339 --> 00:56:48.861]  Dozens of other great films by other researchers.
[00:56:49.541 --> 00:56:52.343]  My book, Paul Watson's book, you can print copies off there.
[00:56:53.864 --> 00:56:55.044]  It's ridiculous.
[00:56:55.645 --> 00:56:59.827]  Weekly reports, audio interviews, text reports, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:57:00.187 --> 00:57:05.210]  Weekly information changed every week, updated every week, new stuff every week.
[00:57:05.928 --> 00:57:06.848]  There's just so much there.
[00:57:07.889 --> 00:57:09.969]  It's $0.15 a day with a yearly subscription.
[00:57:09.989 --> 00:57:12.290]  $0.19 a day with a monthly subscription.
[00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:15.490]  At least get a monthly subscription to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:57:15.951 --> 00:57:18.051]  Let's talk to Kyle in California.
[00:57:18.091 --> 00:57:18.991]  Kyle, go ahead.
[00:57:19.011 --> 00:57:21.812]  Hey, Johnny Infoseed.
[00:57:21.872 --> 00:57:23.372]  Thanks for taking my call there.
[00:57:23.392 --> 00:57:27.493]  I had a couple of ideas, Alex, and a question for you.
[00:57:28.414 --> 00:57:33.135]  One, maybe change the name of PrisonPlanet.tv to University at Prison Planet.
[00:57:33.925 --> 00:57:36.026]  So many hours of useful information there.
[00:57:36.106 --> 00:57:39.388]  I appreciate all that you've done there.
[00:57:40.329 --> 00:57:57.960]  I know you like to examine things with a little foresight, and not anything against the fine people at Berkeley or anything, but here in the Bay Area, they've got something that's called Listener Sponsored Radio that gives you basically about 30% more information about any given topic that I'm sure you're aware of.
[00:57:58.927 --> 00:58:04.570]  The other idea was if you could try and secure an interview with Chris Carter from the Exiles.
[00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:11.053]  He really seems like he'd be a keystone piece as far as just giving the masses some information.
[00:58:11.954 --> 00:58:23.139]  And the question for you would be, what do you think of Michael Ratner from the Center for Constitutional Rights in his court case in Germany against Rumsfeld, Bush, and Gonzales?
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:26.180]  Well, I'm aware of that case.
[00:58:26.241 --> 00:58:27.121]  What do you think of it?
[00:58:28.166 --> 00:58:34.311]  Well, it seems that there's some real positives as far as bringing justice, but I can also see the flip side of it.
[00:58:35.091 --> 00:58:39.815]  It's the global government aspect, the global justice movement.
[00:58:40.215 --> 00:58:40.996]  It's a little bit deeper.
[00:58:41.096 --> 00:58:41.596]  Exactly!
[00:58:41.616 --> 00:58:42.177]  You know what?
[00:58:42.237 --> 00:58:42.717]  Stay there.
[00:58:42.877 --> 00:58:48.361]  We'll talk about this briefly on the other side, then about ten minutes into the next hour, we're going to have Dr. Dennis Cuddy joining us.
[00:58:48.381 --> 00:58:48.862]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:02.072]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.733 --> 00:59:03.553]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.313 --> 00:59:05.214]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.234 --> 00:59:09.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.056 --> 00:59:14.178]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.379 --> 00:59:21.482]  Alright, into the second hour on the second day of February 2005.
[00:59:22.423 --> 00:59:24.684]  On this Wednesday, I'm Alex Jones, your host coming up.
[00:59:25.635 --> 00:59:33.581]  We've got Dr. Dennis Cuddy, expert on the Globalist, expert on the New World Order, just incredibly informed, joining us, and of course your phone calls.
[00:59:34.482 --> 00:59:47.992]  And I've got a bunch of news about the Cashless Society Control Grid going in and all these new laws that make us all criminals, plus new information on an expansion of the National ID Card that they passed in December of 2004, just a month and a half ago.
[00:59:48.412 --> 00:59:52.055]  Now they want to expand it to a Pan-American ID Card, as we told you they would do.
[00:59:53.053 --> 01:00:04.043]  But we were talking to Kyle in California, and he mentioned how these war crimes trials have been introduced in Germany and with the EU courts and the UN courts, all these different things.
[01:00:04.804 --> 01:00:08.347]  And he said, you know, it sounds good, but isn't this empowering globalism?
[01:00:08.367 --> 01:00:08.867]  And it's true.
[01:00:10.088 --> 01:00:12.010]  They've totally taken people's rights in England.
[01:00:12.030 --> 01:00:15.013]  They'll take your property, take your free speech, take whatever.
[01:00:16.098 --> 01:00:23.969]  And do these horrible things and then to get justice they go to the EU court or other international courts and the courts will actually hand down good rulings.
[01:00:26.189 --> 01:00:35.616]  Which, you look how the courts are codified, they're kangaroos, they're tribunals, their law is that you have no rights in the EU, but they're giving down some good rulings.
[01:00:36.016 --> 01:00:46.223]  And so it makes them look like the final recourse, and then England and others will follow their orders, and so it's being seen as a helper or a savior.
[01:00:47.092 --> 01:00:59.095]  And it's very, very dangerous, and I'll just say the folks that run the EU courts run our courts, and it's... We had the Supreme Court the last two years go, oh yes, we're going to follow the orders of the foreign courts now.
[01:00:59.135 --> 01:01:01.236]  That's where we get our final judgment.
[01:01:01.656 --> 01:01:02.636]  So very dangerous.
[01:01:03.076 --> 01:01:03.917]  Anything else, Kyle?
[01:01:05.017 --> 01:01:12.619]  No, it just seems like this whole globalism, this whole globalist plot is just a way to manipulate
[01:01:13.052 --> 01:01:18.213]  Globalism which is happening and do it on their terms which is going to leave the people out to dry.
[01:01:18.594 --> 01:01:23.315]  But I appreciate your effort and I look forward to shaking your hand one day.
[01:01:23.335 --> 01:01:23.995]  Thank you very much.
[01:01:24.035 --> 01:01:25.235]  Alright sir, God bless you.
[01:01:25.255 --> 01:01:26.416]  I appreciate the call.
[01:01:27.956 --> 01:01:30.657]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:01:31.966 --> 01:01:33.407]  Let's talk to Kim in Texas.
[01:01:33.447 --> 01:01:34.128]  Kim, go ahead.
[01:01:34.368 --> 01:01:34.748]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:34.768 --> 01:01:35.489]  How are you doing today?
[01:01:35.509 --> 01:01:35.929]  Great.
[01:01:36.390 --> 01:01:36.810]  Hey, listen.
[01:01:36.830 --> 01:01:41.094]  I called in earlier this week about the Weekly Reader and the Arnold Amendment.
[01:01:41.534 --> 01:01:42.014]  That's right.
[01:01:42.054 --> 01:01:43.656]  Some of the schools use it.
[01:01:43.676 --> 01:01:47.699]  It tells you about amending the Constitution for Arnold and how great the vaccines are.
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:55.826]  Yeah, and I decided to do a little research on the Weekly Reader to find out exactly who they were and who owned the company.
[01:01:56.502 --> 01:02:03.084]  What I found out is that they were purchased back in 1999 by a company called Ripplewood Holdings.
[01:02:03.464 --> 01:02:04.745]  Are you familiar with that company?
[01:02:04.985 --> 01:02:05.225]  No.
[01:02:06.045 --> 01:02:07.186]  Well, boy.
[01:02:07.206 --> 01:02:13.768]  Boy, in 30 minutes I was able to figure out that it's completely loveless and New World Order.
[01:02:16.469 --> 01:02:19.890]  The founder and CEO is a gentleman named Timothy Collins.
[01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:22.491]  He has an MBA from Yale.
[01:02:23.799 --> 01:02:28.982]  He's a former manager of Onyx Corporation in New York.
[01:02:30.242 --> 01:02:35.005]  One of the things that they do is they purchase up, they're a purchasing company or an investment company.
[01:02:35.605 --> 01:02:53.154]  And what they've done since they were founded in 1995 is they've purchased education, publishing and training, technology, automotive retail, specialty chemicals, consumer products and food manufacturing, and industrial products.
[01:02:54.162 --> 01:03:02.510]  And they also are a subsidiary, or they own, or are affiliated with Timelife Incorporated.
[01:03:02.530 --> 01:03:10.397]  So, and some of the other things I found out about this gentleman, you know, is that he serves on the Trilateral Commission.
[01:03:13.019 --> 01:03:16.840]  Well, yeah, that's the Globalist for you, along with David Rockefeller and Brzezinski.
[01:03:16.941 --> 01:03:23.743]  But, you know, when you first called in, you said, oh yeah, the books at school say Arnold for President and vaccinations.
[01:03:23.803 --> 01:03:26.223]  I said, oh, is it Time Magazine for kids?
[01:03:26.524 --> 01:03:26.924]  Right.
[01:03:26.984 --> 01:03:29.805]  Because, I mean, that's just as bad, and all the schools have that.
[01:03:30.345 --> 01:03:31.765]  And, I mean, I've seen copies of this.
[01:03:31.805 --> 01:03:34.026]  I mean, it's like Orwellian propaganda.
[01:03:35.054 --> 01:03:36.556]  Yeah, well, Timelife Inc.
[01:03:36.636 --> 01:03:38.559]  is one of their affiliates.
[01:03:38.699 --> 01:03:42.865]  He's on all these boards, like for Rosie's for Kids Foundation.
[01:03:43.906 --> 01:03:46.790]  It's time to get our children out of these government training camps.
[01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:48.272]  Dr. Cutty's coming up.
[01:03:48.312 --> 01:03:48.792]  Great points.
[01:03:48.832 --> 01:03:49.834]  Thanks for the call, Kim.
[01:03:53.308 --> 01:03:57.673]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.853 --> 01:04:02.279]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.419 --> 01:04:06.804]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[01:04:06.904 --> 01:04:08.206]  A New World Order.
[01:04:09.107 --> 01:04:10.328]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.683 --> 01:04:34.129]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:39.672]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:54.657 --> 01:04:55.518]  Chemical attacks!
[01:04:55.578 --> 01:04:56.238]  Dirty bombs!
[01:04:56.338 --> 01:04:56.758]  Fallout!
[01:04:56.838 --> 01:04:57.839]  Biological attack!

[01:05:02.822 --> 01:05:05.304]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.684 --> 01:05:20.273]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.313 --> 01:05:20.613]  government.
[01:05:20.793 --> 01:05:22.594]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:22.974 --> 01:05:28.878]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.018 --> 01:05:33.521]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[01:05:39.265 --> 01:05:40.486]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.546 --> 01:05:41.127]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.147 --> 01:05:43.188]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:52.572 --> 01:05:54.913]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:55.174 --> 01:05:59.016]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:05:59.336 --> 01:06:00.157]  Read the labels.
[01:06:00.577 --> 01:06:04.719]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:09.122]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:09.482 --> 01:06:14.365]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:14.745 --> 01:06:18.288]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:18.508 --> 01:06:23.872]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:24.132 --> 01:06:26.874]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:27.175 --> 01:06:28.055]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:06:28.356 --> 01:06:39.104]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[01:06:39.544 --> 01:06:40.464]  All right, folks.
[01:06:40.624 --> 01:06:42.505]  Eight minutes, ten seconds into the second hour.
[01:06:42.545 --> 01:06:43.945]  I've had Dr. Cutting on many times.
[01:07:08.872 --> 01:07:17.058]  But today I want to get him on and just talk about current events and news and then get his perspective on why the Globalists are doing this.
[01:07:18.159 --> 01:07:26.986]  And talk about our good friends over at the New World Order and get his forecast of what he thinks is going to happen in the next few months and next few years.
[01:07:27.646 --> 01:07:32.010]  And again, I can't really stress enough how on target Dr. Dennis Cuddy is.
[01:07:32.270 --> 01:07:34.632]  There's a lot of writers and researchers out there
[01:07:35.481 --> 01:07:41.584]  Who put out their forecast and make their claims and talk about the New World Order and give you their global analysis.
[01:07:42.504 --> 01:07:44.045]  And frankly, a lot of it's garbage.
[01:07:45.086 --> 01:08:00.713]  I don't like to attack people by name, but really a lot of it is infuriating because I live my life, constantly, 16, 17, 18 hours a day studying the New World Order.
[01:08:00.853 --> 01:08:02.754]  And Dr. Cuddy really knows the plan.
[01:08:03.154 --> 01:08:04.615]  He's studied it longer than I have.
[01:08:05.328 --> 01:08:06.928]  And it's great to have him on.
[01:08:06.948 --> 01:08:09.869]  We're going to be going back to Dr. Cuddy here in just a few seconds.
[01:08:09.929 --> 01:08:15.150]  I would also just like to mention to listeners, we've added a lot of new features to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:17.751 --> 01:08:28.774]  All 11 of my films, my book, Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, the lead sponsor, Terror and the New World Order, hundreds of weekly TV reports, special reports, a bunch of other
[01:08:30.214 --> 01:08:36.143]  Bonus reports I've done, interviews I do, things that don't go in the films, we're putting that up on the site.
[01:08:37.270 --> 01:08:49.374]  In fact, going up today is George Norrie at TalkFest here in Austin, with myself and him up on the stage, taking questions from the audience, you know, stuff like that, is going up on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:49.874 --> 01:08:58.657]  Fifteen cents a day if you sign up for a year, nineteen cents a day if you sign up for a monthly subscription, and if you're online, it's well worth it, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:03.899]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to Dr. Dennis Cuddy, and of course your calls are coming up early in this hour.
[01:09:04.439 --> 01:09:05.860]  Dr. Cuddy, good to have you on with us.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.161]  Thanks for having me.
[01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:07.941]  You bet.
[01:09:08.222 --> 01:09:11.824]  Just kind of a thumbnail sketch for those that don't know who you are.
[01:09:12.084 --> 01:09:14.266]  Tell us about yourself and I've got questions for you.
[01:09:15.567 --> 01:09:15.967]  Okay.
[01:09:16.508 --> 01:09:35.042]  Well, early on, I guess back in the 60s, I think now, after the fact, I was being groomed by these, as I call them, power elite for big and better things because I was an inquisitive type and challenging whatever orthodoxy there seemed to be going.
[01:09:35.849 --> 01:09:42.530]  The problem for them was that not only did I do that, which they liked, but I also would question and challenge them as well.
[01:09:42.650 --> 01:09:46.911]  So I suddenly found that doors that were opening suddenly closed.
[01:09:47.711 --> 01:09:58.893]  And I began to check into these people and found out I'd been at one of the, well, actually the first, as it was called, Governor's School of the Nation, sort of a gifted and talented school.
[01:09:59.193 --> 01:10:04.374]  And later I was able to get the correspondence between the Tester, the psychological corporation in New York,
[01:10:05.290 --> 01:10:13.598]  That they were using, and the correspondents basically said they wanted to keep up with us, keep tabs on us and any similar groups, and so that opened a little door.
[01:10:14.178 --> 01:10:15.099]  It was like a puzzle.
[01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:25.469]  You start finding these documents, diaries, private papers, letters, and you start adding them up, and pretty soon you find out what the New World Order is all about.
[01:10:25.909 --> 01:10:27.471]  I pursued a graduate degree.
[01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:31.532]  And I was still looking into this with the early muckrakers.
[01:10:32.152 --> 01:10:35.675]  About a hundred years ago, those were the investigative journalists of their day.
[01:10:36.395 --> 01:10:39.817]  And they were far superior than the current bunch.
[01:10:39.837 --> 01:10:51.725]  They actually dug into the Rockefeller group and found out who was really making and breaking empires and so on, and that they had agents in every hamlet of the United States watching people who they could support.
[01:10:52.917 --> 01:11:17.627]  Give money to and further up the ladder and so forth and so the the puzzle piecing continued and after that I Had a little stint of teaching at UNC Chapel Hill And then I went up with the federal government and found out how the inside works and it's so like a revolving door You'd found these find these foundation people would flood into the government when they're let's say Jimmy Carter was there and then when somebody
[01:11:18.482 --> 01:11:30.011]  They didn't like they'd go back to their foundations and fund various projects and it was a funding mechanism for implementing, in this case, education, but all sorts of other things.
[01:11:30.231 --> 01:11:31.372]  Let me stop you for a second.
[01:11:31.932 --> 01:11:35.755]  I've got some world books from the 60s, encyclopedias from the 50s.
[01:11:36.807 --> 01:11:39.148]  I've got one from the fifties with this big foldout.
[01:11:39.648 --> 01:11:51.114]  When you look up the New World Order and it's Mussolini, Hitler, all these people and they called for a New World Order, global government controlled by... And then today we have politicians saying New World Order.
[01:11:51.815 --> 01:11:52.115]  H.G.
[01:11:52.155 --> 01:11:53.756]  Wells wrote about a New World Order.
[01:11:53.776 --> 01:11:55.576]  He wasn't just a science fiction writer, folks.
[01:11:55.596 --> 01:11:59.498]  He was a futurist and a top globalist kind of minion.
[01:12:00.279 --> 01:12:03.320]  Four people that are always wondering, you know, what is the New World Order?
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:04.541]  What is their goal?
[01:12:06.076 --> 01:12:13.858]  Well, over the years, different people have meant different things, but basically you can boil it down, including today, into a world government.
[01:12:14.238 --> 01:12:17.798]  But it's not just the government, it's the world economy, one world religion.
[01:12:19.419 --> 01:12:25.360]  The goal isn't to just plop it on the people saying, okay, now you're under this dictatorship.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:30.381]  What they do is they create situations so the public actually wants this sort of stuff.
[01:12:30.461 --> 01:12:35.582]  It's like in Orwell's 1984 where he said, you will come to love Big Brother, you will actually seek
[01:12:36.774 --> 01:13:05.725]  uh... the uh... guidance and uh... beneficence of this uh... powerful a group of people big brother group of people uh... in the world government that they would do it initially by economics the plan was to have regional economic arrangements that they link up into a global economy and then say okay and then no one country can stand by itself only the global corporations that are bigger than the countries can manage and control uh... right global corporations and uh... international investment bankers yeah that's a group of the right
[01:13:06.952 --> 01:13:19.405]  And they'd say the global economy has to be managed by a world government, and of course to get everybody buying into it, it would have to be a synthesis of Eastern Communism and Western Capitalism into a world socialist government as the ultimate goal.
[01:13:20.922 --> 01:13:26.748]  And we have the biggest bankers, the richest families openly pushing all of this in their own papers, their own publications.
[01:13:27.109 --> 01:13:28.150]  Now it's out in the open.
[01:13:28.190 --> 01:13:41.384]  I mean, when somebody like Thomas Barnett at the Pentagon comes out, and I don't know if you've seen that lecture he gave on C-SPAN, the top strategist there at the Naval War College, darling, and he says, look, we work for Wall Street,
[01:13:41.969 --> 01:13:43.630]  We are about global stock.
[01:13:44.331 --> 01:13:45.852]  We don't work for the American people.
[01:13:45.952 --> 01:13:48.534]  It is the four stages of globalism, New World Order.
[01:13:48.874 --> 01:13:50.875]  I mean, he's right out in the open saying it.
[01:13:52.076 --> 01:13:56.399]  Yeah, he has what he calls a PowerPoint presentation, and he's very out in the open.
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:13:59.041]  If you actually follow these people, they will come out.
[01:13:59.321 --> 01:14:03.584]  I remember there was this week with, it used to be David Brinkley, now Stephanopoulos.
[01:14:04.125 --> 01:14:11.530]  I remember a couple of years ago, somebody, I think Cokie Roberts, was asking Stephanopoulos about why Clinton changed his position on China.
[01:14:12.374 --> 01:14:14.576]  Originally, it was a human rights violation.
[01:14:14.636 --> 01:14:15.777]  We can't have trade with China.
[01:14:15.797 --> 01:14:17.338]  Then he flip-flops and says, okay.
[01:14:17.698 --> 01:14:22.221]  And Stephanopoulos just said, oh yeah, that's right, Goldman Sachs, CFR, so forth.
[01:14:22.241 --> 01:14:23.242]  That's right, that's what did it.
[01:14:23.642 --> 01:14:27.665]  And so, if you keep your eye on them, they'll actually come out and tell you what's going on.
[01:14:29.166 --> 01:14:30.307]  They do it all the time.
[01:14:31.288 --> 01:14:37.092]  And it's... Now, some people say, well, world government's a logical progression from
[01:14:37.788 --> 01:14:44.247]  From hunter-gatherers to agrarian to city-states to nation-states to regional governments to
[01:14:45.456 --> 01:14:46.616]  And they've introduced the bill.
[01:14:46.656 --> 01:14:48.677]  They passed the National ID Card a month and a half ago.
[01:14:48.717 --> 01:14:53.959]  Now a new bill, the supplement, is going to create the Pan-American Union ID with standardized stuff.
[01:14:54.039 --> 01:14:57.260]  Rich went to England three weeks ago, called for a World ID Card.
[01:14:58.161 --> 01:15:00.782]  Why don't we want to live under this, number one, Dr. Cuddy?
[01:15:01.802 --> 01:15:08.084]  Well, it's similar to when people ask me what's wrong with National Education Standards or Curriculum.
[01:15:08.725 --> 01:15:10.885]  The problem is the oneness of the thing.
[01:15:10.905 --> 01:15:12.186]  There are no options.
[01:15:12.926 --> 01:15:17.347]  You have these elite at the top, whether it's in education, whatever it is, saying this is the way to do it.
[01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:24.429]  And if those people have been in charge of education back in the 60s, then we'd all be suffering under what was called the new math, which was a disaster.
[01:15:24.889 --> 01:15:41.493]  And so if you have, if you follow the logic of the pronouncement that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely, then even if you had tomorrow a beneficent or benevolent dictator, as it were, at the top,
[01:15:42.831 --> 01:16:00.876]  It wouldn't be any time at all before you really had some sort of autocratic, totalitarian... Exactly, they're putting in mechanisms built for abuse, and they're not helpful, they're not good, they're totally sadistic and power-mad, and they're creating a straitjacket.
[01:16:01.516 --> 01:16:04.257]  People don't understand, Dr. Cuddy, I'm sure you know this,
[01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:07.592]  That they don't just set up police states for nothing.
[01:16:08.093 --> 01:16:10.315]  I mean, they're not setting up this police state for no reason.
[01:16:10.536 --> 01:16:15.241]  It's because they're going to take the pension funds, they're going to have the National Graph, they're going to do all this stuff.
[01:16:16.042 --> 01:16:21.908]  They're already doing all sorts of horrible things right now to our freedoms.
[01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:26.353]  And what will life be like under the New World Order if they succeed?
[01:16:28.086 --> 01:16:31.048]  Well, it'll be like the gulags.
[01:16:32.668 --> 01:16:36.530]  The thing is, a lot of people are looking at it as something obvious.
[01:16:36.750 --> 01:16:38.471]  Something instant.
[01:16:38.971 --> 01:16:39.271]  Pardon?
[01:16:39.571 --> 01:16:41.352]  Something instant, yeah.
[01:16:41.432 --> 01:16:42.713]  Not only instant, but obvious.
[01:16:42.753 --> 01:16:49.916]  Like, here comes the villain, you know, with his handlebar mustache and, you know, give me the deed to your ranch or I'm going to put you on the railroad track or whatever.
[01:16:50.436 --> 01:16:52.957]  But these people don't do that.
[01:16:53.758 --> 01:16:57.059]  They use situations so that the public, you know, if there's school shootings,
[01:16:57.423 --> 01:16:59.484]  And then everybody says, oh my goodness, gun control.
[01:16:59.504 --> 01:17:01.105]  And they say, OK, we'll give you gun control.
[01:17:01.785 --> 01:17:04.286]  And so they'll do that, or 9-11 happens.
[01:17:04.326 --> 01:17:07.608]  And oh my goodness, for peace and safety, we'll give up some of our freedoms.
[01:17:07.668 --> 01:17:10.749]  OK, you'll get the Patriot Act and Homeland Security Act.
[01:17:10.829 --> 01:17:12.810]  And it works more like that.
[01:17:12.870 --> 01:17:16.172]  You'll have people losing their credit cards.
[01:17:16.212 --> 01:17:22.155]  OK, we'll give you a non-paper currency, or you'll have this handy little number.
[01:17:22.617 --> 01:17:28.602]  on this card will be all yours and nobody can swipe it you know and so that's what we'll use instead of actual paper currency.
[01:17:28.642 --> 01:17:29.723]  And this is long term.
[01:17:29.763 --> 01:17:34.627]  I mean they'll have their pundits out there for years going identity theft, identity theft, identity theft.
[01:17:35.247 --> 01:17:47.037]  And then they even create the outcry, set up a system where identity theft was easy, don't prosecute it, and then they have their people come out and say we've got to have a national ID card to stop this.
[01:17:47.757 --> 01:17:48.138]  That's right.
[01:17:48.418 --> 01:17:50.239]  And they'll do it in various ways.
[01:17:50.279 --> 01:17:51.100]  What they try to do is
[01:17:51.511 --> 01:17:54.872]  If they come at you with one big proposal, you'll be wise to it.
[01:17:55.272 --> 01:17:59.093]  So they do it sort of piecemeal, like in the case of the driver's license.
[01:17:59.233 --> 01:18:11.517]  Oh, we don't have a national driver's license, but then the feds sort of regulate what each state is required to do, and voila, as they say, you in effect have a national ID using state's driver's license.
[01:18:11.657 --> 01:18:13.918]  And then, by the way, we signed some treaties.
[01:18:13.998 --> 01:18:16.839]  It's the same system with Mexico and Germany.
[01:18:18.035 --> 01:18:19.919]  Yeah, and people are oblivious.
[01:18:20.059 --> 01:18:22.323]  I may have told you this before.
[01:18:22.363 --> 01:18:28.475]  Back in 95, we signed with Europe, the European Union, what's called a Transatlantic Agreement, where we more or less
[01:18:29.039 --> 01:18:42.351]  Agreed to mesh our social welfare systems, our educational systems, so that if you're in Austin, Texas and you want to go to Brussels, your academic credentials as an electrician will be accepted there.
[01:18:42.371 --> 01:18:42.591]  Yes.
[01:18:42.952 --> 01:18:43.452]  Stay there.

[01:19:47.756 --> 01:19:48.537]  The real money folks.
[01:20:01.846 --> 01:20:03.767]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:20:04.267 --> 01:20:05.188]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:20:05.228 --> 01:20:06.729]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:20:06.769 --> 01:20:07.189]  A 5% increase.
[01:20:07.789 --> 01:20:10.271]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:20:10.491 --> 01:20:13.913]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:20:14.033 --> 01:20:15.314]  Gold has gone from the $3.90s to the $440s.
[01:20:26.554 --> 01:20:28.734]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:20:29.335 --> 01:20:32.375]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:20:53.929 --> 01:20:56.431]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.191 --> 01:20:59.853]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:00.573 --> 01:21:16.722]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[01:21:17.683 --> 01:21:22.886]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[01:21:23.701 --> 01:21:31.644]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:32.664 --> 01:21:33.204]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.

[01:21:33.565 --> 01:21:34.965]  The call is free.
[01:21:34.985 --> 01:21:39.107]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:54.426 --> 01:21:58.929]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:21:59.269 --> 01:22:03.351]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:22:03.651 --> 01:22:04.192]  We listened.
[01:22:04.512 --> 01:22:09.495]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:22:09.775 --> 01:22:10.255]  We listened.
[01:22:10.636 --> 01:22:13.677]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:22:14.118 --> 01:22:14.618]  We listened.
[01:22:15.078 --> 01:22:19.160]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.021]  We listened.
[01:22:20.361 --> 01:22:25.603]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:22:26.024 --> 01:22:27.384]  Again, we listened.
[01:22:27.744 --> 01:22:35.128]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:22:35.508 --> 01:22:38.970]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:46.593]  You know, Dr. Cuddy's the real trooper.
[01:22:46.733 --> 01:22:47.554]  He's not just a
[01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:08.952]  Freedom lover and a patriot.
[01:23:08.993 --> 01:23:15.397]  He had throat surgery, but he's still with us here on air and going to be with us 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:23:15.818 --> 01:23:18.780]  And then he's got another talk show coming up, so we're honored to have him.
[01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:27.727]  And callers, Jim and Tim and many others that are holding your calls are coming up for Dr. Dennis Cuddy at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:28.647 --> 01:23:31.950]  Dr. Cuddy, before I get into some news items and get your response to them,
[01:23:32.811 --> 01:23:35.154]  Can we defeat the New World Order?
[01:23:35.734 --> 01:23:37.937]  I mean, obviously, it's not going to be an overnight victory.
[01:23:37.997 --> 01:23:39.098]  Their system's incremental.
[01:23:39.699 --> 01:23:46.266]  Obviously, if we weren't here fighting it, it'd be much worse today if we weren't here resisting it.
[01:23:47.087 --> 01:23:53.114]  But overall, I mean, how do you see a victory taking place against the New World Order, or do you see that not happening?
[01:23:54.462 --> 01:23:56.823]  It's going to be difficult for this reason.
[01:23:56.863 --> 01:24:00.244]  It's not all, well, I'll have to do two or three things here.
[01:24:00.764 --> 01:24:07.926]  Number one, what they've done, they're very clever, is they don't have a single target that you can focus on.
[01:24:07.946 --> 01:24:10.767]  What they do is they control systems.
[01:24:12.047 --> 01:24:22.610]  In education, for example, if you're locally and you've got a bad superintendent and you say, well, let's, you know, 5,000 people show up to protest and lo and behold, you succeed and out the superintendent goes.
[01:24:23.467 --> 01:24:30.471]  The system is rigged, though, so that your next superintendent also has to be credentialed by those same progressive education colleges.
[01:24:30.551 --> 01:24:32.472]  So it's like shark teeth!
[01:24:32.652 --> 01:24:34.053]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:34.213 --> 01:24:39.596]  Plus, you've got to remember that their attitude is they'll get the public to request something.
[01:24:39.616 --> 01:24:40.716]  It's sort of like Crassus.
[01:24:40.837 --> 01:24:43.378]  Remember when Spartacus was rebelling in the Roman Empire?
[01:24:44.173 --> 01:24:49.356]  Crassus used that rebellion to say, OK, I'll save you people of Rome, but you've got to give me more power.
[01:24:49.376 --> 01:24:54.639]  And so the people say, oh, please, Crassus, take more power from us as the members of the Republic.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:58.381]  Thirdly, it's not just a single thing.
[01:24:58.701 --> 01:25:00.782]  It's multiple layers.
[01:25:00.882 --> 01:25:04.344]  For example, it's not just, let's say, the driver's license, his ID.
[01:25:04.684 --> 01:25:05.505]  It's not just that.
[01:25:06.112 --> 01:25:11.935]  But there's something called the Intelligent Transportation System Joint Program Office, which your listeners probably never heard of.
[01:25:12.035 --> 01:25:16.157]  And that's the system that scans your license plates, and the coal roads, and you know.
[01:25:16.237 --> 01:25:22.261]  Yeah, and they're going to track by, I guess, by 2015, 57 million cars.
[01:25:22.301 --> 01:25:24.202]  So it's not just, you know, a driver's license.
[01:25:24.222 --> 01:25:25.402]  They're going to be tracking your car too.
[01:25:25.422 --> 01:25:27.523]  And by the way, that's already in in most states.
[01:25:27.684 --> 01:25:27.844]  Right.
[01:25:27.984 --> 01:25:33.026]  Another thing they do is they say it's coming up in 10 years, when it's already implemented, I think, in like 30 states.
[01:25:33.527 --> 01:25:33.827]  Okay.
[01:25:34.387 --> 01:25:42.831]  The next thing is, you've got to remember, it's not just something obvious, like here's an incident, but what they've done is preconditioned people.
[01:25:44.072 --> 01:25:53.497]  For example, most of the listeners may be in Texas, I'm not sure about Texas, but we're all over the nation, most of the water supplies have fluoride, okay?
[01:25:53.577 --> 01:25:59.339]  Your listeners probably heard about a controversy about fluoride, you know, and it really doesn't save your teeth and so forth.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:02.261]  What your listeners may not know is that
[01:26:03.092 --> 01:26:19.084]  This was originally developed way back by not only the communists, but the German General Staff, the Nazis, found out that there was a tissue in the left side of the brain that sodium fluoride, fluoride in the water, would make people less resistant to domination.
[01:26:19.904 --> 01:26:30.938]  And so by pumping fluoride into the water, what they're doing over many, many years is slowly conditioning the people to accept what's happening to them, to not resist the domination.
[01:26:31.379 --> 01:26:32.981]  And by the way, we have the documents.
[01:26:33.141 --> 01:26:35.985]  I have documents from the University of Texas in the 30s.
[01:26:37.122 --> 01:26:39.803]  Where they did tests on rodents with sodium fluoride.
[01:26:40.343 --> 01:26:41.083]  This is known.
[01:26:41.203 --> 01:26:42.104]  This was done.
[01:26:42.124 --> 01:26:47.225]  And then, it doesn't matter if most people are against fluoridation, they still do it.
[01:26:47.526 --> 01:26:54.588]  And I've seen millions of dollars spent by even private corporations because they love us so much to get, say, the water fluoridated in San Antonio.
[01:26:55.328 --> 01:27:01.490]  Yeah, and the person they picked to do that, I have to give about a 30-second history of this thing.
[01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:06.772]  At the end of the Second World War, Truman hired this fellow, Oscar Ewing.
[01:27:07.426 --> 01:27:10.048]  And he put him in charge of the Federal Security Agency.
[01:27:10.108 --> 01:27:11.349]  Sounds like Homeland Security.
[01:27:11.969 --> 01:27:14.291]  And under that agency was the Public Health Service.
[01:27:15.391 --> 01:27:17.893]  And he hired Edward Bernays to do this.
[01:27:18.774 --> 01:27:27.819]  And your listeners, if they're not familiar, Edward Bernays was hired by William Paley, CFR member, to be his chief advisor when he began CBS Radio back in 1928.
[01:27:29.164 --> 01:27:35.807]  In the same year, Bernays wrote a book called Propaganda, in which he said, we now have the technical means to manipulate you.
[01:27:35.887 --> 01:27:38.449]  We are an invisible government and we're going to control you.
[01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:42.011]  And among his examples were like Lucky Strike Cigarette.
[01:27:42.051 --> 01:27:44.612]  They used to have a white package and a red bullseye on it.
[01:27:45.272 --> 01:27:48.674]  And they were going to come out with menthol and they wanted the green bullseye.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:28:06.009]  And so they hired Bernays, and Bernays went to the Garment District up in New York, and the Odonaga Silk Factory, whatever it was, and what they did was they said the fashions for the next couple of years are going to be red and green, and that's how we got people to opt into the menthol as well as Recula.
[01:28:06.289 --> 01:28:08.030]  And that's the level of control.
[01:28:08.070 --> 01:28:17.015]  And listen, Bernays is the father of modern advertising, the father of PR, and he's saying in his book, we are global government, you are slaves, ha ha!
[01:28:17.702 --> 01:28:19.444]  Yeah, he's Sigmund Freud's nephew.
[01:28:20.264 --> 01:28:24.768]  In fact, perhaps, I've read that quote many times, I even have a copy of the book, but perhaps we should read that when we get back.
[01:28:24.949 --> 01:28:26.009]  I mean, folks, this is the thing.
[01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:27.751]  It's not debatable.
[01:28:28.352 --> 01:28:31.174]  Sodium fluoride, the Nazis used it at the death camps.
[01:28:31.534 --> 01:28:33.136]  Folks, none of this is debatable.
[01:28:33.176 --> 01:28:34.437]  Do you understand us?
[01:28:34.737 --> 01:28:36.058]  They're taking over!
[01:28:36.078 --> 01:28:40.983]  Alright, we'll be back with our guests, and we'll take your calls.
[01:28:43.966 --> 01:28:47.007]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.027 --> 01:28:50.709]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.630 --> 01:28:57.852]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[01:28:58.612 --> 01:29:06.855]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:29:07.456 --> 01:29:09.196]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[01:29:09.897 --> 01:29:10.517]  While you listen,
[01:29:11.152 --> 01:29:15.874]  Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[01:29:16.495 --> 01:29:18.076]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[01:29:18.616 --> 01:29:20.757]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[01:29:21.357 --> 01:29:23.378]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:29:23.939 --> 01:29:25.039]  And it's so easy.
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.821]  To learn, you simply listen.
[01:29:28.601 --> 01:29:29.201]  When you want.
[01:29:29.762 --> 01:29:30.402]  Where you want.
[01:29:31.222 --> 01:29:36.185]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the Verbal Advantage they need for success.
[01:29:37.054 --> 01:29:39.857]  To learn more about Verbal Advantage, call now.
[01:29:39.877 --> 01:29:40.658]  1-800-41419-WORD.
[01:29:40.678 --> 01:29:41.138]  That's 419-WORD.
[01:29:41.158 --> 01:29:41.298]  1-800-419-WORD.
[01:29:53.689 --> 01:29:58.912]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:59.052 --> 01:30:07.157]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.418 --> 01:30:14.462]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:14.642 --> 01:30:15.923]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:30:16.003 --> 01:30:21.887]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:22.087 --> 01:30:27.171]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.291 --> 01:30:36.177]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:36.437 --> 01:30:39.740]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:30:41.901 --> 01:30:42.301]  I think?
[01:30:53.462 --> 01:30:56.563]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[01:30:56.863 --> 01:30:59.163]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:30:59.384 --> 01:31:06.505]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:31:06.705 --> 01:31:12.087]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:31:12.327 --> 01:31:16.968]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals.
[01:31:17.228 --> 01:31:19.769]  Not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:31:19.949 --> 01:31:21.110]  Either way, why chance it?
[01:31:21.310 --> 01:31:30.875]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call for Sea Minerals at 877-817-9829 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost in the immune system.

[01:31:43.641 --> 01:31:44.541]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:44.561 --> 01:31:46.502]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:32:05.789 --> 01:32:07.850]  All right, your calls for Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:09.151]  A lot of fun lines coming up.

[01:32:13.392 --> 01:32:22.036]  Before we go back to Dr. Cuddy, my friends, you need to get my 9-11 package that I'm still offering, but not for much longer.
[01:32:23.277 --> 01:32:26.338]  My film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, almost three hours long.
[01:32:26.438 --> 01:32:29.199]  Part two of that, The Masters of Terror Exposed.
[01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:34.802]  And then George Humphrey's film, 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[01:32:35.965 --> 01:32:40.932]  And then Eric Huffman's 9-11-11 Painful Deceptions DVD or VHS.
[01:32:41.393 --> 01:32:48.303]  Four films and we're talking about over nine hours.
[01:32:49.509 --> 01:32:56.292]  of footage and Paul Watson's 320-something page book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and The New World Order.
[01:32:56.332 --> 01:33:03.055]  You will be an expert on government-sponsored terror and The New World Order and what they're up to by getting these four films and this book.
[01:33:04.396 --> 01:33:06.597]  $59.95, a $53 discount.

[01:33:10.468 --> 01:33:13.271]  We've got a deal where you buy one of my Road to Tyranny films for $24.95.
[01:33:13.391 --> 01:33:16.513]  Each additional copy is $5.95 to give as gifts.
[01:33:16.773 --> 01:33:18.355]  Or just buy one copy and make copies.
[01:33:18.375 --> 01:33:19.276]  Just get them out to people.
[01:33:19.516 --> 01:33:20.216]  That's the goal.
[01:33:20.276 --> 01:33:21.017]  Save this country.
[01:33:21.217 --> 01:33:22.078]  Defeat the globalists.
[01:33:22.999 --> 01:33:26.882]  You can also get my book and Paul Watson's book for $19.95.
[01:33:27.362 --> 01:33:28.823]  That's about a $10 discount.
[01:33:29.204 --> 01:33:30.565]  Just a lot of big specials.
[01:33:30.605 --> 01:33:31.366]  My bumper stickers.

[01:33:33.647 --> 01:33:34.208]  They're free.
[01:33:34.348 --> 01:33:35.509]  You just gotta pay for the shipping.

[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:17.241]  All the best interviews.
[01:34:17.721 --> 01:34:19.181]  Hundreds of weekly TV reports.
[01:34:19.382 --> 01:34:20.182]  All of my films.
[01:34:20.222 --> 01:34:22.703]  Dozens of other films we've been authorized to post.
[01:34:23.163 --> 01:34:24.183]  My book online.
[01:34:24.203 --> 01:34:25.024]  Paul Watson's book.
[01:34:25.044 --> 01:34:25.884]  A bunch of other books.
[01:34:26.904 --> 01:34:28.605]  Including the online of H.G.
[01:34:29.085 --> 01:34:30.026]  Wells' New World Order.
[01:34:30.346 --> 01:34:32.767]  It's all there at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:33.107 --> 01:34:34.447]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:34:34.467 --> 01:34:35.448]  15 cents a day.
[01:34:37.012 --> 01:34:44.355]  Before we go to the calls and cover a few other news items, Dr. Cuddy, how do folks get some of your preeminent books on the New World Order?
[01:34:46.136 --> 01:34:56.660]  Well, I'm afraid that's a good question because they're all, except for the cover-up books, sold out.
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:35:02.002]  They sell very well and so at the moment they're all sold out except the cover-up book.
[01:35:04.488 --> 01:35:07.010]  A bunch of these for me, and I haven't even got them on the website yet.
[01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:07.971]  I've had them for months.
[01:35:08.011 --> 01:35:09.252]  I need to get that done.
[01:35:10.072 --> 01:35:11.273]  Well, the cover-up book's excellent.
[01:35:11.293 --> 01:35:11.914]  How do folks get it?
[01:35:12.914 --> 01:35:15.576]  Well, I would hope they would get it from you.
[01:35:17.198 --> 01:35:18.338]  Well, it's not up there yet.
[01:35:18.639 --> 01:35:23.082]  I mean, I guess I could have them put them on the 1-800 number and put it on the website tonight.
[01:35:23.462 --> 01:35:24.263]  Okay, we'll do that.
[01:35:24.323 --> 01:35:27.005]  I will crack the whip, and I will get it up there.
[01:35:27.525 --> 01:35:29.627]  And how much should I sell it for, Dr. Cuddy?
[01:35:30.805 --> 01:35:34.467]  Well, the retail is $11.95.
[01:35:35.188 --> 01:35:38.030]  Okay, well we'll get them up there on the website by tonight.
[01:35:38.590 --> 01:35:40.051]  And we do have the cover-up book.
[01:35:40.091 --> 01:35:41.972]  I had no idea we'd be doing this, but that's fine.
[01:35:42.272 --> 01:35:44.914]  And what about websites where we can read some of your great writings?
[01:35:46.375 --> 01:35:53.059]  Most of my articles are published on newswithviews.com.
[01:35:53.159 --> 01:35:56.001]  You know, they're just awesome, but I would ask you to start sending me your articles.
[01:35:56.041 --> 01:35:56.982]  We put them on the main page.
[01:35:58.172 --> 01:36:00.674]  Uh, I'm going to make a note right there to do that.
[01:36:00.834 --> 01:36:03.016]  Let me give you my secret email address during a break.
[01:36:03.396 --> 01:36:03.816]  Alright.
[01:36:04.016 --> 01:36:08.360]  Because it gets caught and lost in all the spam and the other email addresses.
[01:36:08.420 --> 01:36:10.121]  I'll tell you, that spam's out of control.
[01:36:10.481 --> 01:36:12.443]  We need to have the government take over the internet.
[01:36:13.644 --> 01:36:13.924]  Right.
[01:36:13.984 --> 01:36:14.764]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:36:15.245 --> 01:36:16.666]  Well, no, that's the way they work.
[01:36:17.246 --> 01:36:18.047]  That's the way they work.
[01:36:18.087 --> 01:36:20.829]  Now, I wanted to bring up another point before we take calls.
[01:36:21.750 --> 01:36:25.354]  Semantical manipulation and false left-right manipulation.
[01:36:25.394 --> 01:36:26.074]  Two questions.
[01:36:26.094 --> 01:36:28.076]  I want you to try to get a synopsis.
[01:36:28.517 --> 01:36:30.679]  Give us your unique perspective on it.
[01:36:30.699 --> 01:36:34.943]  But here's an example of how they semantically manipulate things.
[01:36:36.164 --> 01:36:37.385]  Over and over and over again.
[01:36:38.346 --> 01:36:40.308]  They will call George Bush
[01:36:41.332 --> 01:37:00.324]  A conservative, when he's doubled the growth rate of government for gun control, open borders, almost all his appointees are more liberal than Clinton, he's increased abortion funding by 82% since Clinton, 110% Department of Education, some departments have even quadrupled, but most of them are doubling.
[01:37:00.925 --> 01:37:06.068]  All the classic social welfare state things, amnesty, all of this,
[01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:12.891]  But then Rush Limbaugh will get on the air and say, you've got to get behind the National ID card.
[01:37:13.551 --> 01:37:14.892]  The liberals are against it.
[01:37:14.912 --> 01:37:20.313]  I actually heard him say this, but it didn't matter because people didn't check the facts.
[01:37:20.353 --> 01:37:23.554]  The Democrats voted more with Bush than Republicans did on that.
[01:37:23.594 --> 01:37:27.595]  I mean, how do we explain to people the semantical manipulation?
[01:37:30.652 --> 01:37:33.953]  Unfortunately, the public, through the public schools, has been dumbed down.
[01:37:34.673 --> 01:37:58.579]  They, you know, prior to about 40 years ago, people knew exactly what you're talking about if they just read Alice in Wonderland, you know, Humpty Dumpty, and they would say, well, words mean whatever I say they mean, and they were deliberately changing it, and then, you know, more recently, Orwell's New Speak and Double Think, Freedom is Slavery, Ignorance is Strength, War is Peace, you know, they knew the games that people, including the government,
[01:37:59.398 --> 01:38:03.359]  Apparently could play, but now they've been so dumbed down, it's really hard.
[01:38:04.399 --> 01:38:15.822]  What they do is they'll say, George W. Bush is a conservative, and therefore, if you are to the right of a more conservative than he is, when he's really not a conservative, then you must be some sort of extremist.
[01:38:16.222 --> 01:38:19.683]  And that's part of that, as you've described before, the Delphi Technique.
[01:38:20.023 --> 01:38:24.884]  You alienate and discredit people who are at the extreme left or right, doesn't matter.
[01:38:25.284 --> 01:38:28.865]  Because what you're driving is the forced consensus.
[01:38:29.432 --> 01:38:31.774]  Or a synthesis that is the ultimate goal.
[01:38:32.614 --> 01:38:39.198]  And so, what you might have, let's say, in this Iraq election would be a typical example of it.
[01:38:40.519 --> 01:38:43.401]  The way you would explain it is say, what is the goal of these people?
[01:38:43.441 --> 01:38:47.383]  Well, in their own words, they want this permanent military presence there in the region.
[01:38:47.819 --> 01:38:50.320]  All right, how do you get a permanent military presence?
[01:38:50.360 --> 01:38:53.641]  You have to have whoever is in control requesting you to stay.
[01:38:53.781 --> 01:38:54.641]  Please stay.
[01:38:54.921 --> 01:38:56.342]  And you create a quagmire.
[01:38:56.802 --> 01:38:57.622]  Uh, okay, right.
[01:38:57.962 --> 01:39:02.524]  And so you have this election, which they're saying, oh, isn't this wonderful, all right?
[01:39:03.004 --> 01:39:16.188]  The problem is, what they've done is they've pitted the Shiites against the Sunnis, all right, so that the Sunnis say, well, you know, this would be Shiite Islamic law, not like separation of church and state,
[01:39:16.713 --> 01:39:29.117]  And so, we, the Sunnis, just like Americans, let's say, Protestants wouldn't want to live under Catholic law or vice versa, they say, well, we can't stand that, you know, so we're not going to participate in this thing.
[01:39:29.497 --> 01:39:33.899]  So that throws a monkey wrench into the process, but just in case that doesn't work out,
[01:39:34.525 --> 01:39:53.199]  What you do is you create a situation where the Shiites are going along with this because they see themselves a majority, but you put this neat little proviso in there that says if two-thirds of the people, when this assembly drafts the constitution, if two-thirds of the people in just three of the eighteen provinces veto it, it's dead!
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:40:03.407]  And so now the Sunnis can come back when this assembly, dominated by the Shiites, who think they're the majority, come up with a constitution based on Shiite Islamic law and say, guess what?
[01:40:03.996 --> 01:40:08.260]  We three provinces, north and west of Baghdad, veto this thing, so you're out of here!
[01:40:09.301 --> 01:40:18.410]  And so therefore, we're going to have to stay there, because we're going to have this permanent military presence that, like I said about America and the gun control, they will request it.
[01:40:18.851 --> 01:40:21.493]  They will continue, please stay, please stay, please stay.
[01:40:22.034 --> 01:40:22.695]  And that's the goal.
[01:40:23.575 --> 01:40:27.019]  It's amazing, and it's making you love Big Brother at the end of the day.
[01:40:28.670 --> 01:40:29.450]  Uh, yeah.
[01:40:29.470 --> 01:40:32.451]  They've had a lot of experience.
[01:40:32.491 --> 01:40:33.892]  Well, let me take a spin here, too.
[01:40:33.952 --> 01:40:37.453]  Rumsfeld had the nerve to get up last year on Face the Nation.
[01:40:37.493 --> 01:40:41.134]  We played the clip, and they said, well, you said there were weapons of mass destruction that you knew right where they were at.
[01:40:41.555 --> 01:40:43.055]  He said, you know, I don't appreciate you saying that.
[01:40:43.075 --> 01:40:46.796]  That's an urban legend made up by enemies of this administration.
[01:40:46.816 --> 01:40:48.457]  And so they played clips of him saying it.
[01:40:49.257 --> 01:40:51.178]  And, of course, that was one time they actually challenged him.
[01:40:52.000 --> 01:40:54.201]  Now they say it was never about weapons of mass destruction.
[01:40:54.241 --> 01:40:56.261]  It was about bringing democracy.
[01:40:56.721 --> 01:41:02.862]  Well, then they said that they weren't going to let anybody know who was running against the already installed candidates until election day.
[01:41:02.882 --> 01:41:06.343]  And then, so you can't even believe the election to begin with.
[01:41:06.383 --> 01:41:13.585]  I mean, it's just... But see, oh, now, see, we went there for democracy, and now we've got to spread it to the other Arab countries.
[01:41:14.345 --> 01:41:19.066]  Well, getting back to what you began with about the weapons of mass destruction,
[01:41:19.861 --> 01:41:24.722]  Even if you look at that, and even if you assume it's correct, it doesn't make sense.
[01:41:25.283 --> 01:41:27.143]  I'm not talking about, you know, somebody lying or not.
[01:41:27.163 --> 01:41:30.904]  I'm saying it just doesn't make sense, because let's say they had weapons of mass destruction.
[01:41:30.944 --> 01:41:34.025]  Let's say they have the up to 500 tons of coal and panels that they have.
[01:41:35.245 --> 01:41:43.648]  Why would you want to then put all of your troops right close together in Kuwait and have them subject to this tremendous amount of weapons of mass destruction, or
[01:41:44.705 --> 01:41:51.351]  If we say now we had to go in there because Saddam had them and might distribute them to terrorists and wherever else.
[01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:52.552]  Yeah, what about Pakistan?
[01:41:52.572 --> 01:41:53.593]  What about North Korea?
[01:41:53.773 --> 01:41:58.057]  Well, the one way to assure that Saddam would distribute them was to invade.
[01:41:58.317 --> 01:42:06.885]  And so either they didn't have them or he has distributed them, which was our goal to prevent anyway in the first place.
[01:42:09.016 --> 01:42:09.697]  Well, it's simple.
[01:42:09.717 --> 01:42:14.180]  They went into Iraq because we've been in control of their intelligence agency since we put Saddam in.
[01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:18.163]  The globalists ordered him to invade all these countries, and they knew he was a pushover.
[01:42:19.303 --> 01:42:25.268]  Not only that, we in the ISI, the Pakistani intelligence, are virtually the same.
[01:42:25.308 --> 01:42:29.971]  And you've got to remember, nobody has ever, well, I mean in officialdom,
[01:42:30.347 --> 01:42:40.175]  Nobody has ever asked why that General Mahmoud wasn't questioned after he had given the $100,000, or had the $100,000 wired to Mohammed Atta.
[01:42:40.575 --> 01:42:50.543]  Well, and again, he was having breakfast with Porter Goshen Graham the morning of 9-11 at 8-30, and Bush was across town at the Ritz-Carlton having breakfast with the head of the Bin Laden family, Swartz A.P.
[01:42:50.603 --> 01:42:56.887]  Leningradian, and then flying him out of the country, and then they flew out the Taliban and Al Qaeda out of Afghanistan three weeks into the
[01:42:58.507 --> 01:42:59.368]  More in Afghanistan.
[01:42:59.388 --> 01:43:00.228]  People don't get this.
[01:43:00.268 --> 01:43:01.709]  It was all staged, folks.
[01:43:01.989 --> 01:43:04.911]  They conscripted little goat herders, little kids in the front lines.
[01:43:05.311 --> 01:43:11.014]  And I'll never forget the Northern Alliance going, why don't you bombard the lines behind the lines where the Arab fighters are?
[01:43:11.034 --> 01:43:12.055]  And then they learned why.
[01:43:12.355 --> 01:43:16.037]  Helicopters landed, picked them up, took them to air bases, and flew them out.
[01:43:16.077 --> 01:43:17.078]  It was all staged.
[01:43:17.918 --> 01:43:18.899]  Yeah.
[01:43:18.919 --> 01:43:23.701]  There was a fellow down where I am at a military base saying he was there.
[01:43:23.722 --> 01:43:24.982]  He had his rifle strained.
[01:43:25.002 --> 01:43:26.183]  They were about ready to attack.
[01:43:26.607 --> 01:43:33.270]  And all of a sudden, he says, here come these helicopters in and swoop in and pick up these guys who are about ready to hit and fly them off to safety.
[01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:35.490]  Well, that was even in the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:55.318]  A special forces colonel had like 4,000 Taliban Al-Qaeda cornered and they were ordered to stand down and they sat there and watched this helicopter, and this was in the San Francisco Chronicle, black helicopters, that means, you know, above secret, you know, Delta, FEMA, and there's whole groups of these people, of these secret squadrons, as they're called,
[01:43:55.998 --> 01:43:59.459]  And they went in and took him out into the airbases and then another general complained.
[01:43:59.799 --> 01:44:01.619]  He caught the head Taliban general.
[01:44:02.079 --> 01:44:08.340]  They were ordered, give him a convoy, give him food and money, release him, and then watched him drive over the Pakistan border.
[01:44:08.820 --> 01:44:17.262]  And for folks that don't understand this, again, they picked Iraq because they controlled it from the beginning with intelligence sources back when they were allies.
[01:44:17.662 --> 01:44:20.682]  Same thing with Afghanistan with the Mujahideen in the 1980s.
[01:44:20.802 --> 01:44:24.883]  I mean, this is the same MO over and over again.
[01:44:26.129 --> 01:44:27.449]  It has a long history.
[01:44:27.469 --> 01:44:31.870]  Saddam, back in the fifties, was a CIA-trained hitman assassination.
[01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:32.850]  Yeah, trained in Egypt in 1954.
[01:44:33.091 --> 01:44:51.034]  Yeah, and the year before that, Allen Dulles had hired Norman Schwarzkopf's father, who had been head of the New Jersey State Police, to train people with a $10 million secret slush fund to overthrow the government of Iran, because they had nationalized their oil, and we didn't like that.
[01:44:52.314 --> 01:44:55.375]  That's right, that's why Norman speaks Arabic.
[01:44:55.971 --> 01:44:59.292]  All right, let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:44:59.913 --> 01:45:01.673]  I appreciate you guys holding patiently.
[01:45:02.133 --> 01:45:04.454]  Jim in Michigan, you're on the air with Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[01:45:04.494 --> 01:45:04.834]  Go ahead.
[01:45:07.375 --> 01:45:09.416]  Or maybe you're not on the air.
[01:45:10.897 --> 01:45:12.297]  He just hung up as I went to him.
[01:45:12.377 --> 01:45:13.798]  Tim in Ohio.
[01:45:13.838 --> 01:45:14.518]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:45:15.178 --> 01:45:15.799]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:45:15.819 --> 01:45:16.499]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:45:16.719 --> 01:45:16.999]  You bet.
[01:45:17.039 --> 01:45:17.359]  Welcome.
[01:45:17.479 --> 01:45:18.239]  Hello, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:45:18.460 --> 01:45:18.740]  Hello.
[01:45:19.160 --> 01:45:20.600]  Interesting conversation, gentlemen.
[01:45:20.640 --> 01:45:22.281]  I appreciate you having us on as a guest.
[01:45:24.497 --> 01:45:25.658]  1947 is an interesting year.
[01:45:25.718 --> 01:45:27.018]  A lot of that came about.
[01:45:27.158 --> 01:45:32.579]  Alex, the last couple times I talked, I was asking you about the Tavistock Institute, which got its start in 1947.
[01:45:32.939 --> 01:45:38.740]  Isn't that the same year of the Nuremberg Trials and the year that they began fluoridating the water?
[01:45:39.041 --> 01:45:42.441]  Same year as the National Security Agency and the National Security Act.
[01:45:43.462 --> 01:45:44.502]  Yeah, tell us about 1947, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:45:46.454 --> 01:45:56.778]  Well, as your listener said, and earlier I mentioned 1947 is when it was called the Federal Security Agency was begun by Truman.
[01:45:56.998 --> 01:46:01.680]  He put Oscar Ewing in charge when he hired Edward Bernays to do the fluoride bit.
[01:46:02.420 --> 01:46:08.523]  In terms of Tavistock, yeah, basically you had the psychiatric clinic back in 1920.
[01:46:09.898 --> 01:46:14.341]  With Deputy Director John Rawlings-Reese up to his usual tricks.
[01:46:14.641 --> 01:46:22.726]  And we have a statement of his back in 1940 saying how they infiltrated the church and infiltrated some other professions to control them.
[01:46:23.227 --> 01:46:28.370]  And so during the Second World War, Alan Gregg was Medical Director of the Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:46:28.390 --> 01:46:33.313]  They would look around to see who they could get to put wartime psychology into the civilian population.
[01:46:33.974 --> 01:46:38.557]  And so they funded something new, the Tavistock Institute of Human Relations, which hooked up with
[01:46:39.506 --> 01:46:47.672]  Kurt Lewin and the research group on group dynamics at Michigan, and they came out with a journal, Public Relations.
[01:46:47.712 --> 01:47:08.085]  But basically, Tavistock sort of did a psychological maneuvering here over the years, and one of their senior associates, Fred Emery, came up with what he called a theory of social turbulence, where he said if you throw a bunch of crises at people, economic, social, political, doesn't matter, they were going to psychological retreat.
[01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:12.859]  And so that was really important in the 60s and 70s.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:18.185]  You heard the phrases tuned out and turned off and things like that.
[01:47:18.605 --> 01:47:29.096]  And so that's what they were trying to do because if you can get the vast majority of the American people tuned out and turned off, then you have fewer people who can control the process.
[01:47:29.496 --> 01:47:31.358]  Wasn't that Dr. Timothy Leary's saying?
[01:47:32.322 --> 01:47:53.603]  Yeah, Timothy, and he also hooked up with the CIA, which was the chief... Yeah, it turned out he was CIA and admitted he was an FBI mole all those years, setting up the kids, getting them on the drugs, and it's just like Gloria Steinem in one of her own books admits, I was a CIA asset, they gave me the money to start Miss Magazine.
[01:47:54.181 --> 01:48:05.350]  Yeah, Larry did all that, and Gloria did that, and Timothy with the CIA was instrumental in a lot of the LSD on college campuses, but the place they got it from was the Eli Lilly.
[01:48:06.090 --> 01:48:11.114]  They cooked up a batch of that, and that's where, you know, you have to, like I said, it's putting the pieces of a puzzle.
[01:48:11.154 --> 01:48:17.499]  Sidney Torrell was a chief person with Lilly, and Bush put him on the Homeland Security Board.
[01:48:17.984 --> 01:48:22.509]  Eli Lilly, I think, is one of the makers of Prozac or one of these antidepressants.
[01:48:22.529 --> 01:48:25.111]  Which is classified, actually, as a hallucinogen.
[01:48:25.652 --> 01:48:28.875]  Psychotropics are a subdivision of hallucinogenics.
[01:48:29.296 --> 01:48:35.883]  Yeah, the psychotropic drugs, their antidepressants as well as other forms, is now a big part of this new quote.
[01:48:36.641 --> 01:48:38.482]  Freedom Initiative of President Bush.
[01:48:38.542 --> 01:48:40.183]  Yeah, it's New Freedom!
[01:48:40.283 --> 01:48:42.324]  Now, that was born of down in Texas, right?
[01:48:42.364 --> 01:48:45.325]  The T-MAP, the Texas Medical Algorithm Program, if I'm correct?
[01:48:45.645 --> 01:48:47.026]  Yeah, that's where it started.
[01:48:47.126 --> 01:48:52.789]  It's gotten somewhat more broad because now there's a New Freedom Commission on Mental Health.
[01:48:52.949 --> 01:48:56.251]  And so they're pushing mental health all over.
[01:48:56.271 --> 01:48:57.171]  Well, there's two things.
[01:48:57.591 --> 01:49:04.715]  There's legislatively in Congress, and then President Bush asked 25 federal agencies to see how they could implement the recommendations of the commission.
[01:49:05.290 --> 01:49:07.332]  But there's two different things.
[01:49:07.412 --> 01:49:10.855]  There's the executive part, that's Bush and the federal agencies.
[01:49:11.416 --> 01:49:24.908]  In terms of federal legislation, a number of conservatives have gotten in trouble for calling up their congressmen and saying, you guys are forcing mental health screenings without... By the way, G. Gordon Liddy refused to shut up about this.
[01:49:25.529 --> 01:49:28.572]  He said call, they got millions of calls, and then he was terminated.
[01:49:29.349 --> 01:49:31.971]  It's like pages right out of the book Philip Drew, Administrator.
[01:49:32.531 --> 01:49:41.177]  Uh, that was, uh, yeah, The New Freedom was, uh, was Woodrow Wilson's theme, and the book was written by Colonel House, who says socialism is dreamed of by Karl Marx.
[01:49:41.317 --> 01:49:41.957]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:49:42.878 --> 01:49:43.378]  We'll be back.
[01:49:43.518 --> 01:49:48.642]  More psychological testing at gunpoint of you and your family, because it's going to start for adults, too.
[01:49:48.942 --> 01:49:50.423]  PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us.
[01:49:53.797 --> 01:49:55.318]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.499 --> 01:49:58.581]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.721 --> 01:50:02.625]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.665 --> 01:50:06.909]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.249 --> 01:50:11.032]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.112 --> 01:50:12.974]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.554 --> 01:50:16.475]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.515 --> 01:50:21.217]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.378 --> 01:50:24.419]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.599 --> 01:50:27.460]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.940 --> 01:50:34.063]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.603 --> 01:50:38.388]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:52:39.039 --> 01:52:42.120]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.280 --> 01:52:48.142]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:00.129 --> 01:53:03.372]  I want to talk to Dr. Dennis Cuddy about how they're criminalizing everything.
[01:53:03.412 --> 01:53:05.093]  Don't finish your homework, you're arrested.
[01:53:06.995 --> 01:53:09.457]  Don't pick up junk in your yard, three years in prison.
[01:53:11.539 --> 01:53:12.840]  Everything becoming a crime.
[01:53:12.960 --> 01:53:15.923]  But then government criminality turned loose.
[01:53:17.284 --> 01:53:19.105]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:53:19.946 --> 01:53:24.510]  Let's go to John and Barney and Fred and Bobby and Ron and others.
[01:53:25.411 --> 01:53:26.552]  John, where are you calling us from?
[01:53:29.693 --> 01:53:31.695]  Some reason we're having trouble with the phone lines today.
[01:53:32.315 --> 01:53:33.556]  Okay, let's go to the next caller.
[01:53:33.956 --> 01:53:34.917]  Barney in Maryland.
[01:53:34.997 --> 01:53:36.398]  Barney, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:53:36.579 --> 01:53:36.999]  Yeah.
[01:53:38.100 --> 01:53:45.266]  I think that the law that I call the Law of Genetic Probability is a method used to control people.
[01:53:46.106 --> 01:53:53.492]  Just like you can train and predict how animals are apt to respond, people respond in a similar way.
[01:53:54.553 --> 01:53:58.096]  People in the military are the most glaring example of this.
[01:53:58.772 --> 01:54:07.125]  Their unofficial motto is, Ours is not to think or reason why, Ours is but to do or die.
[01:54:07.145 --> 01:54:10.911]  The robotic actions of Bush gave the secret away.
[01:54:11.271 --> 01:54:11.752]  What do you think?
[01:54:14.713 --> 01:54:18.536]  Well, are you talking about how, I mean, the globalists know human nature and are good at manipulating it.
[01:54:18.556 --> 01:54:19.076]  Dr. Cuddy?
[01:54:20.277 --> 01:54:22.299]  Yeah, they've done a lot of tests.
[01:54:22.599 --> 01:54:24.701]  Actually, the Army sort of funded B.F.
[01:54:24.761 --> 01:54:37.371]  Skinner back in the 60s about $290,000 to see if, you know, the personnel in the Army could be, I would say, manipulated, to use a term that your listener would be familiar with.
[01:54:38.601 --> 01:54:52.172]  Yeah, you watch them, in the military in particular, they have the reverie sounds, they go to a shower, they go to the bathroom, they go do their daily routine, they march around like toy soldiers, yeah.
[01:54:53.413 --> 01:55:01.700]  Now there's a process, picking up on what the last caller mentioned about 1947, same time, Tavistock, there was something in this country
[01:55:02.378 --> 01:55:05.800]  Yeah, well, I think they use that sensitivity training a lot with the prisoners in North Korea.
[01:55:32.954 --> 01:55:36.417]  Yeah, Edward Hunter went into that quite a bit in the fifties.
[01:55:36.537 --> 01:55:39.139]  And that's a good example of what Alex was saying earlier.
[01:55:39.159 --> 01:55:51.228]  Here you come, North Koreans in, they beat somebody to a pulp, whatever, and then they give them a little food and it turns out that's a conditioning process so the prisoner actually is grateful to the people who are torturing him in the first place.
[01:55:51.569 --> 01:55:53.530]  Well basically they play good cop, bad cop.
[01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:55.171]  Bernie, thanks for the call.
[01:55:55.191 --> 01:55:55.572]  Pleasure.
[01:55:56.798 --> 01:56:02.903]  Dictators and thugs 2,000 years ago, 3,000 years ago, instinctively knew these tactics.
[01:56:02.963 --> 01:56:07.066]  And then these things have been written down and codified 1,000 years ago.
[01:56:07.727 --> 01:56:09.268]  But I've got the documents.
[01:56:10.289 --> 01:56:11.790]  It's been well documented.
[01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:24.260]  The French and then the Germans, 200, 300 years ago, developed the ways to have the soldiers march, to look straightforward, to teach them discipline, to abuse them, to break them down, and to quote, build them back up, where they then defended the cult.
[01:56:25.240 --> 01:56:25.701]  And really,
[01:56:27.296 --> 01:56:38.483]  The French set up a system of how, or the panopticon, where we all self-enforce on each other, and where society itself is set up like a prison.
[01:56:39.203 --> 01:56:39.764]  Dr. Cuddy?
[01:56:40.924 --> 01:56:48.489]  Yeah, that's, if you can condition, it's what Bertrand Russell called mass propaganda.
[01:56:48.509 --> 01:56:51.791]  It wouldn't just be an individual that you'd be hypnotizing or something.
[01:56:52.364 --> 01:57:00.829]  You could create whole societies in which, as Russell said, you could get them actually to say that snow is black, and when you've got them to that point, you don't even need police.
[01:57:00.889 --> 01:57:03.350]  He says the society polices itself.
[01:57:03.811 --> 01:57:09.714]  Well, did you see the New York Times quote where this Bush administration official said, we now actually control reality?
[01:57:09.734 --> 01:57:13.376]  I mean, the quote sounds like O'Brien in 1984.
[01:57:13.536 --> 01:57:15.618]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:57:15.938 --> 01:57:19.840]  In the Ministry of Love, where he's got Winston, and that's important that you just said that.
[01:57:20.196 --> 01:57:23.297]  Because Winston's saying, well, people will never submit to this oppression.
[01:57:23.417 --> 01:57:26.557]  And then O'Brien said, yeah, but what if we quicken the tempo of human life?
[01:57:26.997 --> 01:57:31.138]  Because if you speed things up, then people have less time to reflect on what you're doing to them.
[01:57:31.158 --> 01:57:34.458]  You keep them busy, you know, going to the shopping mall, the ball game, all this stuff.
[01:57:34.858 --> 01:57:37.279]  And you're, it's more easy to, uh, control them.
[01:57:38.599 --> 01:57:39.599]  It's unbelievable.
[01:57:39.699 --> 01:57:41.100]  We'll be back with a third hour.
[01:57:50.189 --> 01:57:53.632]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:53.832 --> 01:57:56.134]  We're now 30 seconds into this third hour.
[01:58:20.592 --> 01:58:22.354]  It is the second day of February 2005.
[01:58:22.434 --> 01:58:26.759]  We have Dr. Dennis Cuddy with us for about another 20-30 minutes.
[01:58:27.220 --> 01:58:29.202]  Time to take your calls and go over some more news.
[01:58:30.069 --> 01:58:33.532]  And again, I challenge you to stop Dr. Dennis Cutting into a search engine.
[01:58:33.572 --> 01:58:35.873]  You'll see a lot of the articles he's written out there.
[01:58:35.893 --> 01:58:38.095]  We posted a lot of them at InfoWars.com.
[01:58:38.575 --> 01:58:40.476]  He's got them at NewsWithViews.com.
[01:58:41.017 --> 01:58:43.118]  We've been talking about just the system of control.
[01:58:43.298 --> 01:58:46.380]  And Dr. Cutting, in the last hour, I said, can we defeat this?
[01:58:46.400 --> 01:58:51.424]  You said, well, it's going to be hard because it is this creeping, multifaceted, multivariate
[01:58:52.171 --> 01:59:06.035]  system where they already control all the major grids and they're masters at really building the rat maze and then we just accept the contours of the walls as if this is our universe.
[01:59:06.075 --> 01:59:08.696]  They're actually map makers of the mind.
[01:59:08.756 --> 01:59:15.057]  We have to build new maps, but to do that we have to show people the roadmap itself.
[01:59:15.117 --> 01:59:17.678]  That's what we intend to do on this broadcast, but I have faith because
[01:59:18.348 --> 01:59:36.236]  We've gone just the last six, seven years from what I witnessed to everybody listening to me, rather than half the people disagreeing, we've gone to folks all over just almost instantly, almost subconsciously, you know, the group consciousness, whatever you want to call it, understanding something's wrong and
[01:59:37.177 --> 01:59:51.112]  So it may seem like the New World Order says that things are flat today, but tomorrow we're going to be the majority, but the world is round, but they're good, like judo experts, and even taking control of our own counter-revolutions, which I've seen some attempts to infiltrate.
[01:59:51.973 --> 01:59:59.561]  But I see humanity making it through this, and we're always going to have problems and evil, and this stuff's going to be going on, but do you think we're at least
[02:00:00.259 --> 02:00:03.221]  Got them behind schedule and holding them back at certain levels?
[02:00:05.322 --> 02:00:11.006]  Yeah, we've got them a little behind schedule, but they're pretty adaptable.
[02:00:11.046 --> 02:00:24.174]  They control our choices, and they control them from early on, so by the time you get to be a presidential candidate, you've already been vetted by these people and beholden to them, or they've got something on you.
[02:00:25.050 --> 02:00:25.510]  As it were.
[02:00:25.991 --> 02:00:33.834]  Plus, if not just that, they actually anticipate that people like you and I will come along and give them a hard time.
[02:00:34.495 --> 02:00:43.259]  And so what they do, this sort of multi-headed hydra they have, is a preemptive strike against us by actually creating their own opposition.
[02:00:43.897 --> 02:00:47.200]  So let's say, you know, there's this new world order, right?
[02:00:47.220 --> 02:00:51.365]  They're going to create, and we're going to wake up to it, and we're going to start exposing it and yelling and screaming.
[02:00:51.805 --> 02:00:57.431]  And so they'll create an opposition, you know, and so you join up the XYZ group or whatever it is.
[02:00:57.975 --> 02:01:04.498]  And lo and behold, the XYZ group is really their group that is out there, you know, even more vociferous than we are.
[02:01:04.538 --> 02:01:07.159]  So, yo, down with the New World Order!
[02:01:07.219 --> 02:01:15.182]  But you can always tell who that group is because they'll finally tell you there's no hope, quit, we were wrong, or they'll start saying really crazy stuff.
[02:01:15.883 --> 02:01:18.984]  Forget about the 9-11 truth movement, just go to sleep.
[02:01:19.184 --> 02:01:23.466]  Yeah, I'm glad you've made that second point especially because the thing is,
[02:01:24.079 --> 02:01:24.699]  It's amazing.
[02:01:53.912 --> 02:01:56.234]  Absolutely amazing, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:01:57.455 --> 02:01:58.476]  I think they're going to lose, though.
[02:01:58.516 --> 02:02:00.557]  I think people are really starting to get wise to them.
[02:02:01.078 --> 02:02:07.903]  Well, the people are starting to get wise, but the people have been conditioned to just sort of sit there and say, yeah, this is bad, what can I do?
[02:02:08.183 --> 02:02:11.285]  Or, I as an individual will, you know, speak out.
[02:02:11.766 --> 02:02:17.710]  What they're really afraid of is publicity from a lasting, organized effort.
[02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:22.514]  For some reason, the American public does not want to organize against these people.
[02:02:23.507 --> 02:02:27.949]  Well, you try any real organization, that's when the feds and the provocateurs start showing up.
[02:02:28.029 --> 02:02:28.349]  I've tried it.
[02:02:28.369 --> 02:02:28.709]  That's true.
[02:02:29.350 --> 02:02:29.810]  That's true.
[02:02:29.890 --> 02:02:34.292]  I mean, they show up, folks, like flies on, you know, sugar.
[02:02:34.652 --> 02:02:37.273]  I mean, it just flies on rotten meat.
[02:02:37.594 --> 02:02:39.074]  And they're just, they're bam, right there.
[02:02:39.935 --> 02:02:41.535]  We'll be right back with Dr. Cuddy and your call.
[02:02:41.555 --> 02:02:41.936]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.678 --> 02:02:50.020]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.181 --> 02:02:54.623]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.763 --> 02:02:59.166]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.206 --> 02:03:00.547]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.336 --> 02:03:06.538]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.618 --> 02:03:13.541]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.661 --> 02:03:15.702]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.042 --> 02:03:26.407]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.668 --> 02:03:27.528]  If you want to understand
[02:03:27.748 --> 02:03:28.088]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:28.148 --> 02:03:29.649]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:03:45.155 --> 02:03:48.437]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.497 --> 02:03:52.680]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:55.722]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.902 --> 02:03:58.303]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.503 --> 02:04:07.148]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.329 --> 02:04:08.689]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:04:08.869 --> 02:04:13.012]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.092 --> 02:04:13.792]  We're good to go.
[02:04:42.170 --> 02:04:43.417]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.484 --> 02:04:51.769]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pep back in your step.
[02:04:51.989 --> 02:04:56.972]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[02:04:57.172 --> 02:05:10.442]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with your spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[02:05:10.682 --> 02:05:13.925]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[02:05:14.565 --> 02:05:16.546]  Introducing the incredible Life Wave Patch.
[02:05:16.746 --> 02:05:20.568]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[02:05:20.788 --> 02:05:23.850]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and little league alike.
[02:05:24.090 --> 02:05:27.592]  The Life Wave Patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[02:05:27.852 --> 02:05:31.954]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition, or just trying to beat the clock.
[02:05:32.234 --> 02:05:34.456]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[02:05:34.656 --> 02:05:38.018]  Go to www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[02:05:38.258 --> 02:05:41.740]  Again, that's www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[02:05:49.048 --> 02:05:54.392]  Yeah, I've got this quote attributed to Karl Rove in the New York Times.
[02:06:16.676 --> 02:06:21.478]  Where he's saying, hey, it doesn't matter if we say there's weapons of mass destruction one day and there aren't the next.
[02:06:21.898 --> 02:06:23.138]  We're an empire now.
[02:06:24.138 --> 02:06:29.220]  And we decide what reality is and we'll make reality today, we'll change it tomorrow, we'll change it again the next day.
[02:06:29.840 --> 02:06:34.962]  That is almost identical to what O'Brien, who's torturing Winston,
[02:06:35.663 --> 02:06:41.027]  Or, re-educating him, loving him, helping him, in O'Brien's words, at the ministry of love.
[02:06:41.427 --> 02:06:47.632]  Which isn't very loving, but, hey, in the age of new freedom being forced psychological testing and drugging, I guess it is the ministry of love.
[02:06:48.413 --> 02:06:49.614]  And truth, and plenty.
[02:06:50.894 --> 02:06:56.999]  But, to read that quote about, we control the reality, they really mean this!
[02:06:57.059 --> 02:07:02.083]  They're saying, you people have no mooring, no compass, you just regurgitate whatever we tell you,
[02:07:03.630 --> 02:07:04.970]  And you're all just passive.
[02:07:04.990 --> 02:07:06.371]  He went on to say that.
[02:07:08.291 --> 02:07:10.252]  And we're going to change reality over and over again.
[02:07:10.552 --> 02:07:12.572]  You know, Winston, how many fingers am I holding up?
[02:07:12.952 --> 02:07:14.593]  He's like, 2, 3, 4, 8, 7.
[02:07:14.813 --> 02:07:16.513]  I don't know.
[02:07:16.593 --> 02:07:17.594]  Whatever you say.
[02:07:17.734 --> 02:07:18.874]  Yes, that's good.
[02:07:19.294 --> 02:07:23.735]  You, Winston, are unable to even tell how many fingers I've got up until I tell you.
[02:07:24.275 --> 02:07:25.856]  That's the type of jellyfish I want.
[02:07:27.276 --> 02:07:28.516]  And this is what they've done.
[02:07:29.997 --> 02:07:31.117]  They know what they're doing.
[02:07:32.350 --> 02:07:34.191]  And it goes for their minions and the rest of them.
[02:07:34.211 --> 02:07:39.955]  I mean, Dr. Cuddy, people will serve this New World Order even though the New World Order does horrible things to them.
[02:07:39.975 --> 02:07:44.919]  And sometimes I feel like Winston, you know, where he goes, something will stop you.
[02:07:45.379 --> 02:07:47.541]  You know, the human spirit will stop you.
[02:07:48.161 --> 02:07:51.003]  And O'Brien's leering over him.
[02:07:51.744 --> 02:07:55.506]  You're thinking that my body looks old, Winston, that I'll soon be dead.
[02:07:55.986 --> 02:07:57.968]  Well, the, you know, the
[02:07:58.626 --> 02:08:06.728]  The pain of the cell is part of the vigor of the organism, always passing on the nerve of power, Winston!
[02:08:07.088 --> 02:08:18.990]  How do the top globalists, I know they're social Darwinists, and well, somebody's got to do it, and we're keepers of the light, so we've got to be more evil than anybody, but I mean, you've been around globalists, you've studied them, how do they do this?
[02:08:19.050 --> 02:08:27.772]  How do they have a, I mean, my conscience just is seared and in pain, just overlooking at what they're doing, much less imagine being part of it.
[02:08:29.971 --> 02:08:34.535]  Yeah, well, if they're breeding, it's the sort of old noblesse oblige.
[02:08:35.996 --> 02:08:49.025]  That's why when I talk to people, I say there's a difference between the values of the French Revolution and the American Revolution, although they sound the same, liberté, galité, fraternité, because the elite believes that they're born to rule.
[02:08:49.045 --> 02:08:54.609]  In fact, David Rockefeller told William Dannemeyer, a congressman from California, that
[02:08:55.652 --> 02:09:00.714]  Most, uh, there are men who are born to rule, but most people, uh, most men are born to be ruled.
[02:09:00.754 --> 02:09:02.535]  Arnold Schwarzenegger told U.S.
[02:09:02.595 --> 02:09:04.455]  News & World Report that in 1990.
[02:09:05.296 --> 02:09:12.859]  And that's, uh, yeah, he, he said in 90 that, uh, he likes control, he likes power, you know, that's, but people need to be, to be led.
[02:09:13.099 --> 02:09:13.959]  Uh, same thing in the movie.
[02:09:13.979 --> 02:09:15.260]  He told him what to do.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:21.322]  Yeah, the same thing in the movie Agency back in 1980, Robert Mitchum was the star there, played, uh, Mr. Quinn.
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.803]  And the way they did it was through subliminal advertising.
[02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:26.225]  They said the people want to be led.
[02:09:26.265 --> 02:09:28.588]  They need to be told what to do.
[02:09:28.708 --> 02:09:36.036]  You notice a lot of them are into, like in the Brotherhood of the Rose, raising flowers.
[02:09:38.226 --> 02:09:40.548]  And they also breed horses and cattle.
[02:09:40.608 --> 02:09:43.550]  We're just another four of Anna.
[02:09:43.590 --> 02:09:44.350]  You're incredible.
[02:09:44.410 --> 02:09:46.912]  During the break I was thinking of what I was going to say when I came back.
[02:09:47.553 --> 02:09:50.054]  And I was going to say they're collectors.
[02:09:50.134 --> 02:09:50.915]  Yeah, they collect.
[02:09:51.115 --> 02:09:52.936]  They like to collect whole societies.
[02:09:53.457 --> 02:09:56.199]  Like this Monopoly board buying up new movements.
[02:09:56.239 --> 02:09:57.279]  They print the money, folks.
[02:09:57.499 --> 02:09:58.800]  And I was going to say they're breeders.
[02:09:59.121 --> 02:10:01.442]  Like the Queen obsessed with breeding dogs and horses.
[02:10:02.543 --> 02:10:03.103]  That's right.
[02:10:03.324 --> 02:10:04.845]  That's what Hitler was obsessed with.
[02:10:04.865 --> 02:10:06.746]  Heinrich Himmler was a breeder.
[02:10:07.678 --> 02:10:23.774]  Yeah, they're always into that genetic engineering and eugenics, and that's why Sir Julian Huxley, right after World War II and UNESCO, which we just rejoined, said that was their purpose, to have a world government and to get people to think about eugenics.
[02:10:23.814 --> 02:10:26.176]  We're just going to have to move in that direction.
[02:10:26.756 --> 02:10:27.898]  And that's what we are.
[02:10:27.938 --> 02:10:32.382]  We are to be managed, to be bred, to be led, to be told what to do.
[02:10:33.067 --> 02:10:37.470]  And it's sort of, as you mentioned before, a new type of feudalism.
[02:10:38.070 --> 02:10:39.911]  And that's what W.J.
[02:10:39.971 --> 02:10:45.675]  Gint, one of the editors of the American Fabian Magazine, wrote this book, Our Benevolent Feudalism.
[02:10:46.075 --> 02:10:50.157]  And they said that's what the oligarchs and plutocrats will run us by in the future.
[02:10:50.197 --> 02:10:56.001]  We'll be in this new age where you'll have this managerial elite and we'll all be these little worker bees under them.
[02:10:57.924 --> 02:11:02.168]  And then you read what the elite's saying, they plan to cull 80% of the worker bees.
[02:11:02.868 --> 02:11:08.453]  Uh, at least 90... Sam Kean at the Gorbachev Forum in 95 said 90% reduction.
[02:11:09.473 --> 02:11:11.395]  And Dave Turner said 95%.
[02:11:11.575 --> 02:11:12.556]  They all applauded.
[02:11:14.057 --> 02:11:15.578]  All of Gorbachev's friends applauded.
[02:11:15.618 --> 02:11:18.381]  So, folks, you have, you know, world government, hey, let's have a world government.
[02:11:18.401 --> 02:11:21.483]  Okay, the people that are building it are saying they're going to kill you.
[02:11:21.503 --> 02:11:23.485]  I mean, you might want to listen to them.
[02:11:23.545 --> 02:11:24.866]  I just might want to.
[02:11:26.389 --> 02:11:30.350]  Yeah, or regulation in this sense.
[02:11:30.710 --> 02:11:32.351]  I had mentioned Eli Lilly before.
[02:11:32.791 --> 02:11:38.333]  What they made was their Marisol, and now just follow this for 15 seconds.
[02:11:39.333 --> 02:11:40.974]  You make the Marisol, all right?
[02:11:41.134 --> 02:11:44.135]  Now, it's not doing very well at all.
[02:11:44.335 --> 02:11:48.456]  It's a mercury-based preservative, and they had to recently remove from childhood vaccines.
[02:11:48.476 --> 02:11:51.837]  What they found is that there's like two and a half times
[02:11:52.475 --> 02:11:55.679]  The youngsters were more likely to get neurological disorders, okay?
[02:11:55.699 --> 02:11:58.042]  So now you've got neurological disorders, right?
[02:11:58.082 --> 02:11:59.584]  Like attention deficit disorder.
[02:11:59.644 --> 02:12:02.868]  Then you come along and say, hey, we need these mental health screenings, right?
[02:12:03.509 --> 02:12:10.358]  And so once you get the mental health screenings under that rubric, you know, that we have these problems with all these youngsters with ADD or whatever,
[02:12:11.073 --> 02:12:14.158]  And once you get that, then you can get them on these strong antidepressants.
[02:12:14.178 --> 02:12:17.764]  And the psychotropics screw their brains up even worse, so now they'll get on more drugs.
[02:12:18.245 --> 02:12:18.445]  Right.
[02:12:18.826 --> 02:12:23.233]  And that way you manage them, you know, Ritalin, whatever it is.
[02:12:23.886 --> 02:12:28.569]  And so that, in turn, might cause a person to go berserk and shoot up a school yard.
[02:12:28.709 --> 02:12:30.710]  Uh-oh, now we've got to have that gun control.
[02:12:30.730 --> 02:12:39.995]  Well, this new kid who shot his grandparents and burned the house down, totally normal, went on Zoloft, and they doubled the dozen one day, and he went absolutely berserk.
[02:12:40.635 --> 02:12:44.017]  And so you have, in the case of the school shootings, whether it's
[02:12:45.256 --> 02:12:48.499]  Let's see, uh, Kip Kinkle, and then there was one or two others.
[02:12:48.519 --> 02:12:49.700]  Clybold, there's hundreds.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:59.769]  I've never seen Larry Ashbrook, Buford Furrow, the woman cutting the toddler's arms off in Fort Worth, the woman drowning the five kids in the bathtub.
[02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:02.472]  I mean, I've never seen one where they're not on this stuff.
[02:13:05.795 --> 02:13:07.857]  The Muhammad guy, the shootings.
[02:13:09.359 --> 02:13:14.844]  Right, and so, therefore, that leads them to one of their other goals, which is gun control.
[02:13:14.905 --> 02:13:19.169]  And then it turns out, in 1983, in their own internal trials, they had all this suppressed.
[02:13:19.209 --> 02:13:23.252]  They knew it radically increased suicide, because it's like acid, folks.
[02:13:23.813 --> 02:13:33.282]  When you're having a good trip, everything's fine, but then you have the bad trip, and it takes the inhibition away, and you're in a dreamlike state, and mommy has a bad dream and starts cutting the kids up.
[02:13:34.056 --> 02:13:37.577]  Okay, and so what happens to that, see it's a progression.
[02:13:37.617 --> 02:13:43.379]  You have the one, the thimerosal, then the ADD, then the shooting the kids, and the cutting the kids up, or whatever.
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:45.740]  So now, who might be a problem to that?
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:50.042]  Well, the problem might be your older folks who have the sense.
[02:13:50.122 --> 02:13:52.963]  They've read Orwell's 1984 and Alice in Wonderland.
[02:13:53.003 --> 02:13:54.964]  So what do we do about the old folks?
[02:13:55.644 --> 02:13:58.745]  What you do is, you give them a flu vaccine.
[02:13:59.702 --> 02:14:06.449]  And what happens there is, this is Dr. Hugh Feudenberg, he's like the premier person in neuroimmunology in the country.
[02:14:07.170 --> 02:14:16.339]  And what he found is, in his research, is that for people between 60 and 65 who receive the flu vaccine, say three or four times during the five year period,
[02:14:17.031 --> 02:14:22.435]  They become 10 times more likely to get Alzheimer's, and they can't remember.
[02:14:22.535 --> 02:14:25.677]  So it's getting rid of, so we don't have to pay these pensions out.
[02:14:25.717 --> 02:14:29.679]  Now let me stop people right there, because Dr. Cuddy, if you type this in Google, you'll find AP on this.
[02:14:30.520 --> 02:14:33.262]  They announced for a year they took thimerosal out.
[02:14:33.922 --> 02:14:34.062]  Right.
[02:14:34.102 --> 02:14:40.927]  But, in three of the vaccines that they try to make mandatory, that they really push, they increased it
[02:14:41.816 --> 02:14:44.938]  To 250 times safe levels per injection.
[02:14:45.779 --> 02:14:55.026]  And the flu shot, again I have AP, has the same 250 times, so they radically increased the Marisol in the flu shots.
[02:14:55.786 --> 02:15:02.871]  And can lead to Alzheimer's, which means the old folks who could be a problem for the Paralete, now they can't really think or remember too well.
[02:15:05.871 --> 02:15:26.560]  On two separate occasions, and we're going to go to calls here in a second, on two separate occasions in the last couple of years, they announced there's a shortage, there really isn't a shortage, and they announced, oh, we did have what we needed to create the artificial scarcity, so lines of people show up, but this year it backfired, record levels of people didn't go get it, and everybody I've talked to is getting wise, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:15:27.640 --> 02:15:28.200]  Yeah, they are.
[02:15:28.621 --> 02:15:34.203]  They're wise to the oil shortage, too, of the 70s, and how that plays out.
[02:15:36.091 --> 02:15:39.913]  Before the time's running down here, did you want me to read that Bernays quote?
[02:15:40.013 --> 02:15:41.814]  Yeah, read us the father of advertising.
[02:15:42.134 --> 02:15:53.760]  Yeah, among many things he said was, quote, this is 1928, those who manipulate the organized habits and opinions of the masses constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of the country.
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:16:00.964]  It remains a fact that in almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business and our social conduct or ethical thinking, we are
[02:16:01.673 --> 02:16:04.835]  Unless you're conscious of the attempt to do it to you, and to face it, you are totally
[02:16:32.586 --> 02:16:33.587]  Under its control.
[02:16:33.847 --> 02:16:33.987]  Yep.
[02:16:35.547 --> 02:16:38.108]  And so how do you get to somebody?
[02:16:38.429 --> 02:16:43.250]  I've noticed really people who are worth a million bucks think they're the elite because they're at the country club.
[02:16:43.651 --> 02:16:46.072]  I find they're some of the biggest defenders of the system.
[02:16:47.592 --> 02:16:48.753]  Biggest defenders?
[02:16:48.833 --> 02:16:50.233]  Yes, defenders.
[02:16:50.453 --> 02:16:57.656]  Yeah, and that's why when people say, well, you know, it's the Masons, it's the Jews, it's the Catholics or whatever, I say, you know, you're missing the point.
[02:16:58.228 --> 02:17:15.218]  This is a, like you were saying, a multi-headed Hydra, and in the end, of course, biblically, there's an Antichrist, but before then, you've got a lot of egos out there that need to be stroked, and so these people are given the idea that they're going to be big shots, however, just like what the SS did to the SA is going to happen to them.
[02:17:15.658 --> 02:17:18.760]  They'll wipe out some of their main supporters when the end comes.
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:26.044]  Because these are people that understand the structure and can form power bases that can threaten the monopoly of power.
[02:17:26.204 --> 02:17:26.544]  That's right.
[02:17:27.367 --> 02:17:29.768]  I want to just inform globalist minions out there.
[02:17:29.848 --> 02:17:30.909]  You are the first.
[02:17:32.049 --> 02:17:32.830]  You are the first.
[02:17:32.870 --> 02:17:35.091]  In fact, they'll keep people like me around for a long time.
[02:17:35.451 --> 02:17:37.312]  They'll go, oh look, see, you've still got free speech.
[02:17:37.852 --> 02:17:38.853]  Alex is still around.
[02:17:39.193 --> 02:17:42.895]  But you, you are dead meat.
[02:17:43.295 --> 02:17:44.095]  They eat their own.
[02:17:45.916 --> 02:17:50.138]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the word you use.
[02:17:50.878 --> 02:17:52.099]  In business and socially.
[02:17:52.737 --> 02:17:59.141]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:17:59.721 --> 02:18:01.442]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.

[02:19:46.395 --> 02:19:48.836]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:49.556 --> 02:19:53.177]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[02:19:53.837 --> 02:19:57.718]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[02:19:58.418 --> 02:20:06.981]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[02:20:07.947 --> 02:20:15.151]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[02:20:16.072 --> 02:20:24.196]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:25.297 --> 02:20:27.799]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[02:20:27.819 --> 02:20:28.419]  That's 1-800-5736.
[02:20:37.603 --> 02:20:38.584]  516-8736.
[02:20:39.505 --> 02:20:40.986]  Call now.
[02:20:41.046 --> 02:20:44.289]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:46.230 --> 02:20:49.213]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:20:49.573 --> 02:20:58.400]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:20:58.720 --> 02:21:03.384]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:21:03.844 --> 02:21:10.571]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:21:10.972 --> 02:21:22.704]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:21:23.224 --> 02:21:27.687]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:21:46.432 --> 02:21:51.533]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.233 --> 02:21:54.554]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:57.615 --> 02:21:59.395]  Alright, let's go to the calls here.
[02:21:59.535 --> 02:22:02.736]  Let's go to Georgia and talk to Bobby.
[02:22:03.776 --> 02:22:04.496]  Bobby, go ahead.
[02:22:04.516 --> 02:22:05.116]  You're on the air.
[02:22:05.196 --> 02:22:05.856]  Thanks for holding.
[02:22:05.876 --> 02:22:07.477]  Hello.
[02:22:07.777 --> 02:22:08.117]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:11.318 --> 02:22:12.778]  These phones today, I tell ya.
[02:22:13.399 --> 02:22:15.621]  He just picked up his cordless phone and hung it up.
[02:22:15.681 --> 02:22:16.282]  That's nice.
[02:22:17.223 --> 02:22:18.043]  Ron in New York.
[02:22:18.063 --> 02:22:18.644]  You're on the air.
[02:22:18.704 --> 02:22:19.425]  Go ahead, Ron.
[02:22:19.445 --> 02:22:20.906]  Hello, Alex.
[02:22:20.926 --> 02:22:22.688]  Hello, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:22:22.828 --> 02:22:35.059]  It's very interesting that you're talking about this topic because just this past Sunday in the New York Times, there was an article in there about how soldiers returning from Iraq are going to undergo even more intensive and inquisitive
[02:22:35.669 --> 02:22:36.350]  That's my point.
[02:22:36.370 --> 02:22:38.112]  They're trying to disqualify these people
[02:22:51.830 --> 02:22:53.712]  From being able to exercise civil rights.
[02:22:53.812 --> 02:22:59.997]  If they can't get us into the criminal justice system, they'll get us into the psychiatric system, or they'll get us into the welfare system.
[02:23:00.017 --> 02:23:03.140]  It's about institutionalizing all of society.
[02:23:03.220 --> 02:23:05.302]  That is the neo-feudal global state.
[02:23:05.922 --> 02:23:06.883]  Dr. Cuddy comments.
[02:23:06.943 --> 02:23:07.624]  Feudal state.
[02:23:09.857 --> 02:23:12.718]  Yeah, it's all for your own good.
[02:23:12.778 --> 02:23:13.759]  Two quick points.
[02:23:13.819 --> 02:23:14.099]  C.S.
[02:23:14.159 --> 02:23:19.481]  Lewis said, of all tyrannies, the tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victim may be the most oppressive.
[02:23:19.702 --> 02:23:28.025]  And the reason I mention that is if you heard George Bush, the current president's State of the Union message, he said, we have lit a fire in the minds of men.
[02:23:28.906 --> 02:23:34.308]  Just like I doubt his daddy could have been ignorant when he used New World Order, had been ignorant of H.G.
[02:23:34.348 --> 02:23:36.769]  Wells' New World Order book about the world government.
[02:23:38.383 --> 02:24:00.331]  George W., somebody has to have known that that really came from Dostoevsky's book, The Possessed, which was later published as The Devils, in which he's talking about you may have somebody with great, he seems to have great motives, but he really, under these seemingly great motives, is the most, as he said, monstrous of villainies and horrors that filthiest that could ever be perpetrated on the people.
[02:24:01.091 --> 02:24:05.873]  So why would he choose a term like that, given that it comes from Dostoevsky like that?
[02:24:07.068 --> 02:24:10.950]  That term wasn't pulled out of thin air in a vacuum.
[02:24:10.970 --> 02:24:13.051]  It wasn't made up at the moment, obviously not.
[02:24:14.272 --> 02:24:16.053]  These guys have a lot of history to work with.
[02:24:16.093 --> 02:24:17.914]  You talked about controlled opposition.
[02:24:17.974 --> 02:24:19.795]  Lenin talked about controlled opposition.
[02:24:19.835 --> 02:24:21.295]  I think he referred to them as the trusts.
[02:24:21.315 --> 02:24:24.937]  In other words, set up the opposition to you so you control the opposition to you.
[02:24:25.437 --> 02:24:31.981]  So they're standing on the shoulder of giant monsters that came before them, be it the communists, be it the Nazis.
[02:24:32.498 --> 02:24:33.439]  They know what they're doing.
[02:24:33.459 --> 02:24:38.322]  But understand, their forebearers are the same big banks and the same European U.S.
[02:24:38.402 --> 02:24:42.584]  elite that funded all those other creatures that you call giant monsters.
[02:24:42.864 --> 02:24:44.265]  They were just wind-up toys.
[02:24:44.685 --> 02:24:46.366]  Absolutely, that's correct.
[02:24:46.406 --> 02:24:46.907]  That's true.
[02:24:47.607 --> 02:24:51.550]  Another thing you mentioned, too, is the utilization of drugs to help control people.
[02:24:51.570 --> 02:24:52.110]  Alright?
[02:24:52.430 --> 02:24:55.372]  I say to you, I'll take the principle and go further with it.
[02:24:55.872 --> 02:25:00.435]  Rather than wait for you to be born and try to drug you 10 or 20 years into your lifetime,
[02:25:01.016 --> 02:25:15.807]  I suggest that they're using pharmacology, whether it is illegal street drugs or legal pharmacology, to corrupt the protoplasm seed of life in your parents, so when you're conceived, you're conceived in your... I've got to let you go, Ron.
[02:25:15.827 --> 02:25:17.128]  I want to put a final caller in here.
[02:25:18.189 --> 02:25:25.294]  Actually, the British have openly talked about pre-screening all embryos and deciding, oh, this child will have aggressive traits.
[02:25:25.674 --> 02:25:26.895]  You can't have a child, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:25:29.356 --> 02:25:32.079]  Let's talk to our last caller, Fred in Pennsylvania.
[02:25:32.099 --> 02:25:32.779]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:25:33.400 --> 02:25:33.940]  Hi, Alex.
[02:25:34.380 --> 02:25:34.681]  Hello.
[02:25:35.541 --> 02:25:38.784]  Dr. Cuddy, what is your doctorate in?
[02:25:39.865 --> 02:25:41.907]  American History, minor in Political Science.
[02:25:42.387 --> 02:25:42.687]  Okay.
[02:25:43.388 --> 02:25:50.674]  I wanted to ask you briefly, the book Unholy Babylon, I had heard about it from a friend of mine on a show yesterday.
[02:25:50.694 --> 02:25:51.835]  Is that from 1982?
[02:25:52.035 --> 02:25:52.095]  Or 92?
[02:25:52.235 --> 02:25:52.956]  I'm not sure of that date.
[02:25:59.274 --> 02:26:00.495]  Have you heard of the book?
[02:26:01.135 --> 02:26:01.675]  I've heard of it.
[02:26:02.595 --> 02:26:03.416]  I'm not sure of the date.
[02:26:03.696 --> 02:26:04.016]  Okay.
[02:26:04.556 --> 02:26:14.480]  Well, I thought that it had been one of those early books that seemed to pull together all these... There were books written 150 years ago about this New World Order.
[02:26:14.800 --> 02:26:16.621]  Yeah.
[02:26:18.181 --> 02:26:25.724]  Well, is there a room for divergence of opinion on what is happening?
[02:26:25.764 --> 02:26:27.345]  Because in my particular
[02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:38.828]  I feel that sometimes you can have two trends going on that are opposite at the same time in history.
[02:26:38.888 --> 02:26:41.229]  What do you think about that particular conclusion?
[02:26:47.705 --> 02:26:59.530]  Yeah, there can be, but the problem is we don't know that the synthesizers aren't doing that as part of their process, forcing us into a synthesis.
[02:26:59.951 --> 02:27:07.174]  It's like Blumenfeld said in the early 60s, if the communist threat were greatly abated, the West would lose whatever incentive it has for world government.
[02:27:07.194 --> 02:27:10.975]  So it may be that this alternate track is trying to force us into a synthesis.
[02:27:12.845 --> 02:27:13.406]  Exactly.
[02:27:13.466 --> 02:27:17.210]  Dr. Cuddy, always great to have you on with us.
[02:27:17.690 --> 02:27:19.792]  You're a real gentleman and God bless you, my friend.
[02:27:20.053 --> 02:27:20.373]  You too.
[02:27:20.793 --> 02:27:21.274]  Take care.
[02:27:21.794 --> 02:27:24.497]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy loves freedom, loves this country.
[02:27:25.118 --> 02:27:26.399]  We appreciate him joining us.
[02:27:26.419 --> 02:27:31.444]  Alright, we're coming up here in a minute with part of an interview I did yesterday that I think is really important.
[02:27:31.985 --> 02:27:33.046]  Stay with us, you don't want to miss it.
[02:27:36.141 --> 02:27:39.123]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.143 --> 02:27:42.846]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.868 --> 02:27:46.909]  Are you a diabetic?
[02:27:47.009 --> 02:27:49.591]  Do you have Medicare or private insurance?
[02:27:49.952 --> 02:27:53.875]  If you do, here's some great news that could save you time and money.
[02:27:54.075 --> 02:28:00.019]  If you're required to test your blood sugar, iCare may be able to provide your supplies at no cost to you.
[02:28:00.139 --> 02:28:00.940]  Here's why.
[02:28:01.340 --> 02:28:02.361]  We work with Medicare.
[02:28:02.521 --> 02:28:02.741]  I think?
[02:28:31.988 --> 02:28:33.410]  1-800-419-2335 800-419-2335 That's 1-800-419-2335 Remember, at iCare, we care!

[02:29:47.586 --> 02:29:53.071]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.492 --> 02:29:57.736]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:57.956 --> 02:30:05.003]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.383 --> 02:30:11.509]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.529 --> 02:30:12.850]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.170 --> 02:30:16.134]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[02:30:34.355 --> 02:30:34.615]  Call today.
[02:31:01.554 --> 02:31:08.899]  All right, coming up here in a minute or two, we'll be talking to founder and chairman of Polynomics Incorporated.
[02:31:09.680 --> 02:31:11.621]  His website's waninski.com.
[02:31:11.761 --> 02:31:14.944]  W-A-N-N-I-S-K-I.com.
[02:31:15.664 --> 02:31:24.290]  And he was associate editor at the Wall Street Journal and also an advisor to President Ronald Reagan.
[02:31:25.171 --> 02:31:26.312]  And the bio goes on and on.
[02:31:26.632 --> 02:31:27.653]  Let's come up in a few minutes.
[02:31:28.253 --> 02:31:29.314]  I heard him this weekend.
[02:31:30.611 --> 02:31:38.496]  On the weekend interview show that another talk show host does with another network, Scott Horton and I was impressed.
[02:31:38.536 --> 02:31:46.141]  I had read about and heard about Mr. Winensky, but I was really impressed by the analysis that he gave on air.
[02:31:46.161 --> 02:31:47.482]  So he's coming up here in a minute or two.
[02:31:47.902 --> 02:31:57.367]  Before we go to Mr. Winensky, I want everybody out there to grab a pen and paper and to cease your procrastination.
[02:31:57.448 --> 02:31:59.629]  Please, get my videos.
[02:32:00.640 --> 02:32:04.003]  I authorize you to make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:32:04.303 --> 02:32:05.864]  Get them out to people.
[02:32:05.884 --> 02:32:07.045]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:32:07.085 --> 02:32:12.730]  The truth behind 9-11 and how it's being used to set up a police state that has nothing to do with fighting terrorism.
[02:32:13.110 --> 02:32:14.891]  Part 2 of that, The Masters of Terror.
[02:32:15.212 --> 02:32:16.913]  My book, 9-11, Dissent and the Tyranny.
[02:32:16.933 --> 02:32:19.715]  Paul Watson's book that I published, Order Out of Chaos.
[02:32:20.316 --> 02:32:21.537]  You need to have these books.
[02:32:21.577 --> 02:32:22.878]  You need to have these videos.
[02:32:23.318 --> 02:32:28.262]  You need to get my new video, American Dictators, documenting the state's election of 2004.

[02:33:07.750 --> 02:33:08.450]  1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[02:33:08.490 --> 02:33:10.831]  The videos are waking people up.

[02:33:12.792 --> 02:33:14.192]  Use them as tools.
[02:33:21.135 --> 02:33:22.756]  Alright, we again have an amazing individual on.
[02:33:22.817 --> 02:33:27.581]  He's Jude Winensky, and again, advisor to Ronald Reagan, associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, political economist,
[02:33:49.042 --> 02:34:04.767]  And a lot of conservatives, you know, we've had generals, we've had admirals, we've had the former Judge Advocate General of the Navy on about how torture's wrong and the neocons are out of control and they're getting our troops killed and the army told them 400,000 troops or it's going to be a Vietnam.
[02:34:05.227 --> 02:34:10.989]  And this staged election and these obvious puppet installments aren't fooling anybody.
[02:34:11.029 --> 02:34:14.650]  Maybe they're fooling some people, but it's not fooling those who are really looking at it.
[02:34:17.057 --> 02:34:19.840]  The media focuses in on people like Gorbachev.
[02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:21.221]  Oh, look at that communist liberal.
[02:34:21.641 --> 02:34:23.523]  He says it's fake, so it must not be fake.
[02:34:24.722 --> 02:34:30.347]  Again, but the media doesn't focus in on people like Jude Wineski and others that are criticizing a lot of this.
[02:34:30.967 --> 02:34:32.789]  Mr. Wineski, good to have you on with us, sir.
[02:34:32.969 --> 02:34:33.550]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:34:33.590 --> 02:34:34.410]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:34:34.911 --> 02:34:35.291]  You bet.
[02:34:35.351 --> 02:34:38.974]  Anything for people that don't know who you are that I didn't cover?
[02:34:39.675 --> 02:34:44.939]  Well, you mentioned before we went on, I wrote a book called The Way the World Works.
[02:34:45.440 --> 02:34:49.163]  And it's really the foundation of the Reaganomics and supply-side economics.
[02:34:49.743 --> 02:34:52.906]  And I developed all that when I was at the Wall Street Journal.
[02:34:53.348 --> 02:35:02.570]  And I was very proud in the year 2000, the editors of the National Review named it one of the 100 most influential books of the 20th century, the way the world works.
[02:35:02.590 --> 02:35:07.292]  Of course, I have to point out that I came in 94th, somewhat behind the joy of cooking.
[02:35:09.372 --> 02:35:12.693]  Well, now, and your website is Wanninsky.com.
[02:35:12.713 --> 02:35:20.915]  Wanninsky.com, and I have a daily commentary, and I've been writing about Iraq a lot lately, and you can register, and it's all for free.
[02:35:21.795 --> 02:35:27.419]  Okay, let's start here with... You talk about your friends, the neocons.
[02:35:27.439 --> 02:35:28.941]  I mean, you know these guys intimately.
[02:35:29.221 --> 02:35:30.061]  Who are they?
[02:35:30.482 --> 02:35:32.463]  Why are you opposing some of their policies?
[02:35:33.264 --> 02:35:38.208]  Well, Richard Perle is kind of the ringleader of the neocons.
[02:35:38.288 --> 02:35:43.412]  A neocon simply means that you used to be a liberal and now you're a conservative.
[02:35:43.472 --> 02:35:44.553]  You're a new conservative.
[02:35:44.993 --> 02:35:48.876]  And I was a liberal Democrat for most of my life.
[02:35:48.956 --> 02:35:50.177]  I'm 68 years old now.
[02:35:52.192 --> 02:36:20.318]  I met Pearl back in 1969 when he was 25 years old and working for Scoop Jackson, the senator from the state of Washington, and George Will, who we all know is now on ABC, and the late Bob Bartley, who was the editor of the Wall Street Journal, and we were all Cold Warriors, and we were united in a very hard line against communism,
[02:36:21.085 --> 02:36:25.148]  in Moscow and in Beijing and fought the Cold War together.
[02:36:25.628 --> 02:36:33.552]  And we were proud at being successful in fighting that Cold War without having a nuclear exchange.
[02:36:34.293 --> 02:36:46.580]  But when the Cold War ended in roughly early 1990s, when the Soviets decided that they had enough of communism, the Russians invited me to Moscow
[02:36:47.133 --> 02:36:52.915]  To try and help them turn their communist system into a market economy.
[02:36:53.635 --> 02:36:55.316]  And I was glad to do that for free.
[02:36:55.456 --> 02:36:57.616]  And I made several trips pro bono.
[02:36:58.537 --> 02:37:04.378]  Because I've never taken any money from a politician or a government in all my years at Polyconomics.
[02:37:04.839 --> 02:37:10.440]  But I broke, I had to break with my old friends because they said, we didn't beat these guys enough.
[02:37:11.060 --> 02:37:12.681]  We have to smash them into the ground.
[02:37:13.357 --> 02:37:19.007]  And we want to feed them bad economic advice, shock therapy, so that they will fall apart.
[02:37:19.568 --> 02:37:24.496]  And I said, well, you know, as far as I'm concerned, when they come out with their hands up and they say we give up.
[02:37:25.191 --> 02:37:30.776]  And we're prepared to be capitalists, and we're prepared to be baptized into the church.
[02:37:31.436 --> 02:37:33.178]  That's enough for me, but it wasn't enough.
[02:37:33.338 --> 02:37:41.404]  But the truth is, they wanted those few oligarchs in so that big global corporations could work with them a little bit easier.
[02:37:41.424 --> 02:37:46.288]  Well, you see, warriors have to be able to fight wars, and otherwise they're useless.
[02:37:46.869 --> 02:37:51.052]  So this is really what's behind Eisenhower's warning about the military-industrial complex.
[02:37:51.511 --> 02:37:53.173]  And that's what the neocons are.
[02:37:53.493 --> 02:37:57.537]  I mean, Dick Cheney, I've known Dick Cheney since he was in his early 30s.
[02:37:57.597 --> 02:38:01.720]  I've known Don Rumsfeld when he was a congressman from Illinois.
[02:38:02.061 --> 02:38:08.387]  These are all people I... Paul Wolfowitz, who's a deputy at the Pentagon.
[02:38:08.567 --> 02:38:10.649]  They're all people I've known all these years.
[02:38:10.949 --> 02:38:12.951]  Bill Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard.
[02:38:13.582 --> 02:38:15.082]  I mean, we were buddies.
[02:38:15.202 --> 02:38:16.123]  We partied together.
[02:38:16.423 --> 02:38:30.426]  Well, I want to go over this, though, because the Washington Post, CNN, big papers in Canada, one headline, what, in the National Mail, the ghost of Trotsky walks the halls of the White House.
[02:38:30.446 --> 02:38:39.869]  You say they're these anti-communists, but didn't the neocons become, you know, founded by Crystal's daddy, you know, out-quote of the failure of the Trotskyites?
[02:38:40.069 --> 02:38:41.711]  Well, yeah, this is Irving Kristol.
[02:38:41.791 --> 02:38:43.672]  He was my mentor.
[02:38:43.733 --> 02:38:44.593]  I mean, I called him.
[02:38:44.713 --> 02:38:48.817]  I coined the phrase Don Corleone.
[02:38:49.258 --> 02:38:50.019]  He's still kicking.
[02:38:50.099 --> 02:38:53.001]  He's now well into his 80s.
[02:38:53.642 --> 02:39:01.930]  And I think Irving himself, Bill Kristol's dad, he's not a neocon in the sense that he really supported all this war.
[02:39:03.669 --> 02:39:07.790]  Probably standing back and saying, look, I'm too old to be involved.
[02:39:07.810 --> 02:39:12.771]  So when did he supposedly switch out of the Fourth International to being this conservative?
[02:39:13.271 --> 02:39:28.375]  Well, this happened after, at the time, at the time of Alger Hiss and Whitaker Chambers, when you had all kinds of people in the late 1940s who had been thinking in terms of
[02:39:29.811 --> 02:39:32.392]  Some form of communism is being acceptable.
[02:39:32.772 --> 02:39:41.134]  Trotskyism being what they kicked around when they were at CCNY, the old city college in New York.
[02:39:41.515 --> 02:39:42.735]  This is how they came together.
[02:39:43.235 --> 02:39:57.319]  And it was in the late 40s that they began to worry that this is not the way they wanted things to develop in the USSR and gradually shifted out of
[02:39:58.312 --> 02:40:02.095]  uh... communism and socialism and then moved into capitalism.
[02:40:02.175 --> 02:40:13.681]  I remember there was a time when uh... when uh... Irving Kristol uh... you know came over, came as far as to say write a book called Two Cheers for Capitalism and then became a complete capitalist.
[02:40:13.962 --> 02:40:15.643]  Yeah, two cheers passage.
[02:40:16.243 --> 02:40:18.765]  I went with him for a good part of that.
[02:40:18.885 --> 02:40:22.567]  Two cheers for crony capitalism, command and control.
[02:40:22.627 --> 02:40:24.348]  See, I go way past all these
[02:40:25.091 --> 02:40:27.752]  Well, there is certainly a lot of corporate capitalism out there.
[02:40:27.772 --> 02:40:29.132]  Have you read this new book about
[02:40:50.638 --> 02:40:53.259]  The Confessions of Economic Hitman?
[02:40:53.419 --> 02:40:54.300]  Yes, we've had him on.
[02:40:54.460 --> 02:40:55.020]  You've had him on?
[02:40:55.180 --> 02:40:57.201]  Yeah, well he's in the ballpark.
[02:40:57.261 --> 02:41:04.804]  There's a lot of stuff in the book that I don't quite agree with, but there is big money in the United States.
[02:41:04.844 --> 02:41:14.549]  There is an establishment on Wall Street and they find it in their interest to have crises around the world that they can
[02:41:15.464 --> 02:41:21.648]  That they can deal with through the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and make money in the process.
[02:41:21.949 --> 02:41:24.771]  We're talking to Jude Wanninski of Wanninski.com.
[02:41:24.911 --> 02:41:28.753]  W-A-N-N-I-S-K-I.com or just go to Infowars.com.
[02:41:28.793 --> 02:41:31.355]  You can link directly through to his website.
[02:41:31.395 --> 02:41:42.063]  He was associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, a political economist, advisor to Ronald Reagan, one of the architects of supply-side economics, a real icon in that movement.
[02:41:42.703 --> 02:41:43.964]  And look,
[02:41:44.878 --> 02:41:55.172]  Shifting gears here, we have the neocons who, with the PNAC documents, wanting to invade 63 countries.
[02:41:55.192 --> 02:41:56.273]  They've invaded two of them.
[02:41:56.594 --> 02:41:58.997]  They're already beginning to attack Syria with these
[02:41:59.898 --> 02:42:05.983]  Saudis into the country of 20 miles, strafing and bombing troops.
[02:42:06.303 --> 02:42:11.247]  They've got special forces in Iran right now snooping about.
[02:42:12.568 --> 02:42:16.492]  Tony Blakely's calling for arresting Cy Hirsch for reporting on it.
[02:42:16.912 --> 02:42:20.034]  Michael Savage is talking about arresting anybody that criticizes the government.
[02:42:20.275 --> 02:42:21.916]  I mean, these guys are like out of control.
[02:42:22.176 --> 02:42:25.619]  I'd call them fascists more than I'd call them Trotskyites or conservatives.
[02:42:26.159 --> 02:42:29.982]  I would agree with that.
[02:42:30.523 --> 02:42:36.167]  Well, I think they are... Pat Buchanan is a good friend of mine.
[02:42:36.227 --> 02:42:37.088]  I talk to him all the time.
[02:42:37.128 --> 02:42:38.829]  I've known him from the early Nixon years.
[02:42:39.810 --> 02:42:49.558]  You know, he said they've passed their peak, the neocons, and that they've gotten so bloodied in Iraq that they're losing power.
[02:42:50.194 --> 02:43:00.119]  And one of the signs, the sure signs, that they're losing influence is the departure of the number three man at the Pentagon, Douglas Fyfe, who's just resigned.
[02:43:00.920 --> 02:43:03.441]  And at the State Department,
[02:43:03.979 --> 02:43:09.943]  Although I've written that I think Condoleezza Rice is really incompetent to be Secretary of State.
[02:43:10.263 --> 02:43:17.488]  She's competent to do a lot of things because she's very bright, but she has shown no skills in the diplomatic world.
[02:43:17.949 --> 02:43:22.292]  But she has brought in with her, as her deputy, Robert Zoellick, who is the U.S.
[02:43:22.332 --> 02:43:29.757]  Trade Representative, and a man I much admire for his diplomatic skills, and that I think
[02:43:30.697 --> 02:43:31.758]  Let me digress for just a second.
[02:43:31.778 --> 02:43:40.903]  The combination of these factors make me a little bit more hopeful that the Bush administration is going to be pointed in a less aggressive direction.
[02:43:40.923 --> 02:43:42.204]  Let me digress for a second.
[02:43:42.704 --> 02:43:44.625]  Why have we seen such an exodus?
[02:43:45.806 --> 02:43:51.769]  That it was just people going to cash in on the private sector while they've still got power for four years with their connections.
[02:43:52.170 --> 02:43:55.211]  But then Karl Rove told U.S.
[02:43:55.251 --> 02:44:02.175]  News & World Report that no, they weren't energetic enough, were kicking all these people out, plus they were lightning rods, were putting in a new batch.
[02:44:02.775 --> 02:44:03.736]  What do you think the truth is?
[02:44:04.936 --> 02:44:13.361]  Well, a lot of the people that are leaving are exhausted and they wound up having to
[02:44:14.332 --> 02:44:23.106]  Uh, go along with the party line in the first administration on a lot of things that they didn't approve of, and they're gone.
[02:44:23.267 --> 02:44:24.869]  So there's a shake-up, there's a...
[02:44:25.932 --> 02:44:30.794]  A new team there, and I wish there were... Yeah, but you say they may be lessening.
[02:44:30.894 --> 02:44:44.479]  I mean, his speech at his coronation last week, or a week and a half ago when he was on the 20th, I mean, Bush was up there literally talking about a crusade against evil.
[02:44:44.499 --> 02:44:55.203]  I know, but he's been backtracking ever since because of the way... You know, that's... President Bush, you know, was chosen by the neocons when he was governor of Texas.
[02:44:55.808 --> 02:44:59.810]  In fact, they picked him to be the candidate.
[02:44:59.830 --> 02:45:04.013]  In fact, the neocons picked George W. Bush when he was governor.
[02:45:04.033 --> 02:45:05.954]  Wasn't it George Shultz that vetted him?
[02:45:05.974 --> 02:45:12.998]  Well, George Shultz, he's part of the gang, and George Shultz is the one who introduced
[02:45:13.826 --> 02:45:31.174]  Condoleezza Rice into the National Security Council in the first Bush administration, to Brent Scowcroft, and then brought her back when President Bush, when Governor Bush, they said, hey look, we want you to run for President, and he essentially told them that he didn't know anything about foreign policy.
[02:45:32.194 --> 02:45:33.055]  I don't know.
[02:45:47.245 --> 02:46:02.336]  And she was there for a week or so, and then she said, Mr. President, you should meet a man I think was very bright, and she brought Paul Wolfowitz down to Crawford, and their pictures were in the paper, and then a week later, here's a picture of Richard Perle!
[02:46:02.496 --> 02:46:03.697]  And then George Shultz came!
[02:46:03.717 --> 02:46:15.386]  Well, and George Shultz was in there, he's a member of the Defense Policy Board, sits right next to Richard Perle, in planning all these maneuvers, and of course, Don Rumsfeld,
[02:46:16.983 --> 02:46:28.917]  Don Rumsfeld introduced Rumsfeld to the neocons back when he was in the Ford administration and he's never been his own man.
[02:46:29.057 --> 02:46:29.618]  In other words,
[02:46:30.203 --> 02:46:36.027]  It's been Pearl and Wolfowitz who have been doing the strategic thinking behind the Pentagon.
[02:46:36.207 --> 02:46:38.269]  And Rumsfeld has been one of their agents.
[02:46:38.369 --> 02:46:48.696]  Mr. Winensky, so is it a real split when Brent Scowcroft and George Herbert Walker kind of send out signals about not being too keen on the war before the war?
[02:46:49.237 --> 02:46:50.898]  Oh, absolutely it was.
[02:46:50.918 --> 02:46:58.904]  I was thinking in the last days before we went to war that because of the positions that were being taken
[02:46:59.124 --> 02:46:59.744]  And by the way...
[02:47:18.115 --> 02:47:20.276]  It was Bill Clinton who pulled the inspectors out.
[02:47:20.296 --> 02:47:22.077]  They never kicked him out.
[02:47:22.137 --> 02:47:24.358]  And then notice we heard it was all weapons of mass destruction.
[02:47:24.699 --> 02:47:26.380]  Now the war was never about that.
[02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:28.501]  Rumsfeld says that's an urban legend.
[02:47:28.521 --> 02:47:30.562]  He never said it on Face the Nation.
[02:47:30.642 --> 02:47:33.403]  No, it was about bringing democracy.
[02:47:34.204 --> 02:47:38.066]  Well, you know, they've run out of all the other excuses, so now they're down to democracy.
[02:47:38.286 --> 02:47:47.471]  And of course the elections that we've had, everybody has tears in their eyes about how wonderful it is that all these people stood in line and braved the insurgents.
[02:47:47.918 --> 02:47:49.660]  But nothing really has changed.
[02:47:50.120 --> 02:47:55.505]  The insurgents don't really care about the turnout, whether it's a big one or a small one.
[02:47:55.845 --> 02:47:56.526]  They are there.
[02:47:56.866 --> 02:48:03.912]  The insurgency is directed at the United States, which has, as far as they're concerned, over the last 15 years,
[02:48:04.929 --> 02:48:12.514]  You know, killed a million and a half Iraqis with the sanctions and with the war, and they want us out of there.
[02:48:12.614 --> 02:48:19.559]  And they're not going to stand for any kind of government that has been shaped and managed by people like Hillary.
[02:48:19.579 --> 02:48:23.502]  By the way, that's roughly 1 out of 20 Iraqis is dead.
[02:48:25.943 --> 02:48:26.464]  Amazing.
[02:48:26.844 --> 02:48:28.445]  Jude Winensky, please stay with us, sir.
[02:48:28.465 --> 02:48:30.447]  I've got a bunch of other questions for you.
[02:48:30.467 --> 02:48:32.408]  I want to talk about what you think is going to happen in Iraq.
[02:48:33.211 --> 02:48:36.934]  Where do you think this is all going in the next year, the next two years, the next five years?
[02:48:37.475 --> 02:48:39.296]  What's your projection for the future?
[02:48:40.037 --> 02:48:41.878]  And we'll also take calls.
[02:48:41.959 --> 02:48:44.321]  I'm Alex Jones, PresidentPlanet.TV.
[02:48:44.341 --> 02:48:44.701]  Check it out.
[02:48:45.689 --> 02:48:52.512]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.832 --> 02:48:54.192]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.392 --> 02:48:56.613]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.753 --> 02:48:58.854]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.134 --> 02:49:04.056]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.396 --> 02:49:08.418]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.678 --> 02:49:10.440]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.520 --> 02:49:21.172]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.332 --> 02:49:23.215]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.575 --> 02:49:27.279]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns in the Info Wars.

[02:49:44.927 --> 02:49:47.949]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:48.249 --> 02:49:53.192]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:53.433 --> 02:49:57.795]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:58.096 --> 02:50:07.001]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:07.222 --> 02:50:10.824]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:11.124 --> 02:50:16.152]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:16.452 --> 02:50:23.203]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:50:23.664 --> 02:50:24.204]  What about you?
[02:50:24.967 --> 02:50:30.309]  Order your KDF Shower Filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:51:56.010 --> 02:52:20.298]  I always seem to have more interesting conversations with our guests during the breaks when I'm talking to them, but I was talking to Jude Winensky, who of course is a world-renowned political economist and former associate editor for the Wall Street Journal, also a top economic advisor and economic architect for Ronald Reagan during his first term of his presidency, and advising during the campaign as well.
[02:52:21.718 --> 02:52:24.399]  Well, when you have an objective as large as the one that they have, and they believe that
[02:52:50.205 --> 02:52:53.147]  That right is on their side, and this is the way to go.
[02:52:53.167 --> 02:53:01.211]  You can't, as they say, you can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.
[02:53:01.731 --> 02:53:04.113]  So, whatever you have to do, you do!
[02:53:04.353 --> 02:53:08.175]  And you make excuses for it, and if you have to trample on the Constitution,
[02:53:09.028 --> 02:53:14.449]  Turn it inside out in order to approve the use of torture, the breaking of international conventions.
[02:53:14.829 --> 02:53:16.250]  You find ways to do that, too.
[02:53:16.450 --> 02:53:20.071]  But doesn't it, Mr. Winensky, seem like they're getting delusional?
[02:53:20.131 --> 02:53:26.332]  I saw a quote in the New York Times by a top White House official saying, hey, you guys go ahead and write about our contradictions.
[02:53:26.752 --> 02:53:27.933]  We are the empire.
[02:53:28.033 --> 02:53:31.874]  We actually set reality, and we'll change reality day to day.
[02:53:31.894 --> 02:53:33.674]  I mean, it's getting Twilight Zone.
[02:53:33.974 --> 02:53:37.715]  Well, it is, and people say, are you saying there's a conspiracy?
[02:53:37.735 --> 02:53:40.576]  And I say, of course there's a conspiracy, and they advertise it.
[02:53:40.877 --> 02:53:42.077]  It's a public conspiracy.
[02:53:42.117 --> 02:53:45.678]  They're saying, here's what we're going to do, and we're going to do it for the good of the world.
[02:53:45.978 --> 02:54:00.944]  Now let me backtrack a little bit, and remember we were talking in the earlier segment about how I was one of these folks, and that when the Cold War ended, one of the arguments that I was making is that, yes, we are an empire.
[02:54:01.434 --> 02:54:07.195]  We are now at the top of the whole political pyramid, of the power pyramid, of the planet Earth.
[02:54:07.515 --> 02:54:12.156]  There's nobody else that... So we have a responsibility to manage the world.
[02:54:12.576 --> 02:54:13.817]  Managing, not policing it.
[02:54:14.197 --> 02:54:27.079]  And the management of it means that we have to consult with all the members of the family of nations, with all of the people in NATO and at the UN Security Council, before we go to war with anyone.
[02:54:27.879 --> 02:54:30.380]  And I was opposed
[02:54:31.332 --> 02:54:42.606]  With my argument that in terms of peacetime, when you're at peace, you put diplomacy first, because it's less expensive, and you don't really want to have wars all the time.
[02:54:43.207 --> 02:54:45.370]  And their argument was exactly the opposite.
[02:54:45.430 --> 02:54:48.594]  They say, we have to have an American empire, but we're going to kick ass.
[02:54:49.316 --> 02:54:51.658]  I want to be clear though.
[02:54:52.058 --> 02:54:54.459]  We the American people aren't part of this empire.
[02:54:54.899 --> 02:54:59.362]  There's this supposed reflected glory of people going, yeah, we are an empire now.
[02:54:59.482 --> 02:55:00.242]  I'm powerful.
[02:55:00.302 --> 02:55:00.483]  No.
[02:55:00.803 --> 02:55:02.704]  In this empire, we're going to be slaves.
[02:55:03.803 --> 02:55:11.366]  Well, that's true, and the problem we had in the last election is that I broke with the Republican Party.
[02:55:11.426 --> 02:55:22.771]  I'd been a Republican voter going back to Rick Nixon in 1968, and I voted for John Kerry, not holding my nose because he was a very good candidate, but I had
[02:55:23.491 --> 02:55:28.114]  But cast a vote against these warriors, because I don't like where they're taking us.
[02:55:28.635 --> 02:55:33.198]  And this is why Bush only won by a small amount of votes.
[02:55:33.458 --> 02:55:35.239]  But you're a smart guy.
[02:55:35.259 --> 02:55:37.540]  You know, Kerry was like, we need to increase the troops.
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:38.721]  We need to... Iran!
[02:55:38.821 --> 02:55:39.722]  Iran's evil!
[02:55:39.762 --> 02:55:40.502]  Let's get them!
[02:55:40.943 --> 02:55:44.045]  And I thought I was listening to George Bush on steroids.
[02:55:44.125 --> 02:55:45.285]  He's terrible.
[02:55:46.186 --> 02:55:49.548]  But what are we going to do for the next four years?
[02:55:49.868 --> 02:55:52.010]  And all I can say is that from
[02:55:52.543 --> 02:56:05.292]  One day to the next, I'm doing everything I can to encourage those forces inside the Bush Administration and inside the Republican Party to move in more moderate directions.
[02:56:06.212 --> 02:56:12.997]  And I'm believing that that will happen, that we're not going to have, they're not going to go into Iran.
[02:56:13.732 --> 02:56:15.173]  There's a lot of bluster about it.
[02:56:15.973 --> 02:56:23.756]  You know, Cy Hirsch did the whole world a favor by his article in the New Yorker where he pointed out all the plans that we have.
[02:56:23.896 --> 02:56:24.597]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:56:24.697 --> 02:56:25.257]  We've got a break.
[02:56:25.277 --> 02:56:26.418]  We're going to start the second hour.
[02:56:26.478 --> 02:56:30.960]  I want to get your predictions on what's going to happen in Iraq and take some calls.
[02:56:31.840 --> 02:56:32.560]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:56:32.580 --> 02:56:34.101]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
