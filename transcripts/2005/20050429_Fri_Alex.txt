[00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:06.586]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.266 --> 00:00:08.308]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.048 --> 00:00:10.129]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.611]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.372 --> 00:00:13.252]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.273 --> 00:00:17.597]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:22.201]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.953 --> 00:00:28.714]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, here we are, another live edition.
[00:00:29.015 --> 00:00:30.355]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:30.375 --> 00:00:32.936]  This is where we engage in real talk radio.
[00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:37.077]  Real issues that actually affect you and your family.
[00:00:38.118 --> 00:00:44.960]  Issues of real significance, not Michael Jackson, not the Lacey Peterson trial, not O.J.
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.660]  Simpson.
[00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:53.483]  Not the issues the media tries to force us to focus on, but the real issues that affect society across
[00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.473]  The political spectrum.
[00:00:56.614 --> 00:00:57.794]  Thank you for joining us today.
[00:00:57.814 --> 00:01:06.417]  We're going to have wide open phones until the last 30 minutes of the broadcast and I got Paul Watson in the third hour joining us.
[00:01:07.797 --> 00:01:14.499]  Talk about these different TV and movie themes that just flaunt government terrorism in our face.
[00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.401]  These plots that mirror exactly what's happening in the real world.
[00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:27.907]  So we'll be discussing some of the globalist Illuminati language that's hidden in plain view.
[00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:33.989]  Coming up at the end of the broadcast today, and that should be very informative and interesting, so stay tuned for that.
[00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.989]  We're going to have open phones throughout this broadcast.
[00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:41.311]  Whatever issue you want to talk about, any questions, any comments, you want to disagree with me, you agree.
[00:01:42.171 --> 00:01:43.791]  There's different news stories.
[00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:50.613]  You want to talk about Bush's ridiculous press conference last night that I didn't watch, I didn't listen to, part of it on the radio.
[00:01:52.443 --> 00:01:57.304]  Whatever you want to talk about, you're welcome to call us at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:57.324 --> 00:01:57.704]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:57.844 --> 00:02:07.786]  I've read Ron Paul's analysis of the REAL ID Act.
[00:02:08.126 --> 00:02:10.306]  I have read sections of the bill.
[00:02:11.627 --> 00:02:14.207]  Now there have been about four different versions of it.
[00:02:15.187 --> 00:02:17.948]  They claim they cut some of the bad provisions out
[00:02:18.607 --> 00:02:24.108]  Because they were worried about Christian conservatives, quote, raining fire and brimstone down on the Republicans.
[00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:25.969]  That's the quote here.
[00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:30.970]  But then I talked to my congressional sources and they tell me the provisions are still there.
[00:02:32.751 --> 00:02:35.872]  And here's a headline from a raw story.
[00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:42.273]  Democrats locked out of debate on sweeping and controversial Real ID Act.
[00:02:42.993 --> 00:02:44.634]  So we'll talk about this.
[00:02:45.547 --> 00:02:50.550]  And callers that got cut off short yesterday arguing with our guest about it are welcome to call back in.
[00:02:51.490 --> 00:03:01.735]  Interrogators, fake interrogations at Guantanamo, witnesses say, according to Reuters, all these camps are fake.
[00:03:03.156 --> 00:03:10.760]  Gitmo, Abu Ghraib, whether it's in Cuba or in Iraq, it's fake.
[00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.341]  And you're going, well wait a minute, those are real people being tortured to death.
[00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:14.182]  Yes!
[00:03:15.501 --> 00:03:17.782]  But it's all for the media.
[00:03:17.922 --> 00:03:19.423]  It's all for the illusion.
[00:03:20.644 --> 00:03:26.007]  It's all to give you the perception that they're really off fighting terrorists.
[00:03:27.948 --> 00:03:28.808]  And that's come out.
[00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.051]  Almost everyone at these camps are just families picked up at checkpoints.
[00:03:35.052 --> 00:03:40.815]  And there's not one even mid-level Taliban or Al-Qaeda member that's ever gone through Camp X-Ray.
[00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:44.177]  They've all got get-out-of-jail-free cards.
[00:03:47.253 --> 00:03:56.081]  And on top of it, you know, two days ago, Bush goes in the bunker and they tell you that he goes in the President's bunker into the White House and Cheney to an undisclosed location.
[00:03:57.963 --> 00:03:59.084]  Site R, normally.
[00:03:59.944 --> 00:04:01.366]  They're on the Maryland-Virginia border.
[00:04:04.426 --> 00:04:07.468]  They do this just to make you think the threat is real.
[00:04:07.528 --> 00:04:13.272]  Every time their approval ratings go down, their memos are public that they do it to fear-monger you.
[00:04:13.312 --> 00:04:17.595]  I mean, we have their admissions, their memos, FBI agents have gone public.
[00:04:18.075 --> 00:04:19.576]  They're terrorizing you!
[00:04:19.596 --> 00:04:21.637]  They're yelling fire in a theater!
[00:04:24.119 --> 00:04:27.221]  It's by its very definition, terrorism.
[00:04:28.658 --> 00:04:36.285]  To threaten violence or to engage in violence for a political outcome is terrorism and they're engaging in it.
[00:04:39.067 --> 00:04:45.133]  But Bush lives by different rules and different standards just like Bill Clinton did because they're puppets of the New World Order.
[00:04:45.353 --> 00:04:48.476]  And that's all they are, dirty little puppets.
[00:04:49.296 --> 00:04:50.137]  Infowars.com
[00:04:51.485 --> 00:04:54.470]  PrisonPlanet.tv are just two of my great websites.
[00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.312]  We'll be back with a ton of news.
[00:04:56.332 --> 00:05:00.879]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.541 --> 00:05:05.406]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:05:06.127 --> 00:05:07.408]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.608 --> 00:05:13.350]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.891]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:19.172 --> 00:05:23.293]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.473 --> 00:05:27.274]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.534 --> 00:05:32.156]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:32.256 --> 00:05:35.016]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:05:35.336 --> 00:05:38.517]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.557 --> 00:05:40.398]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.858 --> 00:05:42.959]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:46.662]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:46.722 --> 00:05:49.443]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:54.586]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:05:54.686 --> 00:05:56.667]  You see Big Brother's afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.908 --> 00:05:58.429]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.609 --> 00:06:00.730]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.756 --> 00:06:12.502]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:12.663 --> 00:06:20.267]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:20.487 --> 00:06:23.649]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.672]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:06:29.932 --> 00:06:36.415]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:06:36.435 --> 00:06:40.337]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:06:40.397 --> 00:06:42.278]  The water level is always visible.
[00:06:42.458 --> 00:06:48.422]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:48.642 --> 00:06:52.905]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.925 --> 00:06:53.926]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:04.213]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:04.473 --> 00:07:08.316]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:08.616 --> 00:07:09.437]  Read the labels.
[00:07:09.877 --> 00:07:14.001]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:18.404]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:18.784 --> 00:07:23.668]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:24.028 --> 00:07:27.631]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:27.811 --> 00:07:33.155]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:33.415 --> 00:07:36.157]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:36.458 --> 00:07:37.358]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:37.659 --> 00:07:48.387]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[00:07:48.747 --> 00:07:53.649]  Call Cal-Bem toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:53.809 --> 00:07:58.670]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit Cal-BemPureSoap.com.
[00:08:02.572 --> 00:08:08.614]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.214 --> 00:08:12.195]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:25.743]  Alright, 8 minutes, 20 seconds into this first hour of worldwide transmission against tyranny, my friends.
[00:08:26.663 --> 00:08:28.264]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:28.284 --> 00:08:30.924]  We're going to be going to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:35.205]  Russell and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:08:35.225 --> 00:08:38.106]  Where to start?
[00:08:38.246 --> 00:08:45.568]  I want to get into this REAL ID Act that on the surface looks like it's going to restrict illegal aliens, but really does the opposite.
[00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:53.735]  And as usual, it's fooling a lot of conservatives and liberals alike, because they're in their false left-right paradigm.
[00:08:54.435 --> 00:08:58.436]  Interrogations fake at Guantanamo, witnesses say.
[00:08:58.916 --> 00:08:59.916]  Reuters, of course.
[00:08:59.936 --> 00:09:00.776]  Again, it's all fake.
[00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:03.177]  This is out of Reuters, Iraq.
[00:09:03.317 --> 00:09:08.178]  Doctors warn of increasing deformities in newborn babies.
[00:09:10.699 --> 00:09:12.519]  We'll have to talk about this horror.
[00:09:13.536 --> 00:09:15.477]  Here's another one from MSNBC.
[00:09:15.657 --> 00:09:19.519]  Sperm damaged by pollution, study finds.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.542]  In the West, we have an over 80% reduction in sperm viability.
[00:09:27.703 --> 00:09:31.826]  And plants are now showing the same type of problems.
[00:09:33.646 --> 00:09:34.467]  This doesn't look good.
[00:09:36.883 --> 00:09:41.226]  Putin defends missile sales to Syria.
[00:09:41.786 --> 00:09:42.547]  Friendly fellow.
[00:09:43.207 --> 00:09:46.190]  Worldwide cancer rates double.
[00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:52.634]  I mentioned this two days ago, but it integrates in with the sperm damaged.
[00:09:54.635 --> 00:09:55.836]  And that really is happening.
[00:09:56.056 --> 00:09:58.838]  I talked to, I have a couple friends that are fertility doctors.
[00:09:59.499 --> 00:10:05.423]  Highway bill could pave way towards more tolls on interstates.
[00:10:06.368 --> 00:10:12.409]  The feds are lifting their regulatory ban on toll roads on interstates.
[00:10:12.489 --> 00:10:15.090]  Of course, that ban was never really there.
[00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:22.871]  Just drive up through Oklahoma into Kansas and other areas around the country, you'll discover it for yourself what the rest of the country is going to look like.
[00:10:23.351 --> 00:10:28.312]  But this fits in nicely to the larger plan.
[00:10:28.652 --> 00:10:31.173]  Governor praises Minutemen campaign.
[00:10:32.116 --> 00:10:37.138]  Schwarzenegger says groups patrols against illegal immigrants have been effective.
[00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:43.001]  Now, he's trying to position himself, speaking out of both sides of his mouth.
[00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:55.406]  He is advised weekly by Karl Rove, and of course, literally, in his offices five days a week, is the Kingmaker, George Shultz, who's even above Karl Rove.
[00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:12.523]  And the Rovian-Straussian neocons that people this socialistic amalgamation of mercantile fascism here on the neo-feudal world plantation control grid.
[00:11:13.624 --> 00:11:17.147]  But last week, we need to shut the borders!
[00:11:17.207 --> 00:11:17.988]  Do it now!
[00:11:19.449 --> 00:11:21.570]  Then he went, I was misquoted!
[00:11:21.591 --> 00:11:22.611]  I didn't speak right!
[00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:24.373]  What I mean is Bush's plan!
[00:11:26.059 --> 00:11:26.759]  It will do it!
[00:11:26.939 --> 00:11:27.820]  It will fix it!
[00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:29.040]  Bush's plan!
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:35.182]  Bush's plan for six years that is automatically re-extended unless it's struck down by Congress.
[00:11:35.662 --> 00:11:37.082]  Anyone who's here is legal.
[00:11:37.202 --> 00:11:38.202]  This is in the plan.
[00:11:38.983 --> 00:11:40.383]  Anyone who is here is legal.
[00:11:40.423 --> 00:11:47.705]  Anyone who can get here is legal by swimming, by crossing, by landing, by... you name it.
[00:11:48.065 --> 00:11:51.266]  They get here, they are legal instantly.
[00:11:52.486 --> 00:11:52.946]  Instantly.
[00:11:53.147 --> 00:11:54.567]  Instant green cards for everyone.
[00:11:55.237 --> 00:12:03.783]  And it allows corporations to take in unlimited skilled workers and something new to bust in and fly in unlimited unskilled.
[00:12:04.723 --> 00:12:06.184]  Total capitulation.
[00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:07.665]  The end of the borders.
[00:12:08.526 --> 00:12:08.986]  No border.
[00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:26.375]  Get people who are against open borders to jump on the neocon bandwagon and they put restrictions on getting out of the country through the northern border, or out of the country through the southern border, or out of the country by flying the airplane out of the international airports.
[00:12:27.735 --> 00:12:28.655]  And that's all in there!
[00:12:29.355 --> 00:12:33.136]  Biometric passports, biometric state IDs that are federalized.
[00:12:34.056 --> 00:12:37.857]  This new bill, they're on the verge of passing and I've got the latest version right here.
[00:12:39.364 --> 00:12:45.371]  In this 5-inch thick stack, and I've got at least the latest version.
[00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:47.053]  There's some new one that we can't get a copy of.
[00:12:47.093 --> 00:12:48.895]  The latest version is from Monday.
[00:12:49.415 --> 00:12:58.866]  That's the latest one on thomas.loc.gov, and it's still got the Pan-American ID card with Mexico and Canada, and the databases and the data mining.
[00:13:00.261 --> 00:13:07.306]  It's got lots of platitudes and headlines in the bill where, as Ron Paul's exposed, it's a Trojan horse.
[00:13:08.086 --> 00:13:10.348]  It says, you know, to stop illegal immigration.
[00:13:10.948 --> 00:13:16.592]  Then you read it and it says that they've just got to go with their consular matriculas and they'll be issued an ID card.
[00:13:19.705 --> 00:13:20.546]  It's unbelievable.
[00:13:20.586 --> 00:13:21.747]  It starts the ball rolling.
[00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:24.208]  We're going to have to have this state ID to have a job anywhere.
[00:13:24.249 --> 00:13:29.052]  And again, it is a federal component with federal guidelines for biometrics and a smart chip.
[00:13:29.552 --> 00:13:31.154]  And 48 states have already got it.
[00:13:31.254 --> 00:13:32.895]  So, I mean, a lot of this is moot.
[00:13:33.435 --> 00:13:34.736]  We need to start trying to remove it.
[00:13:35.877 --> 00:13:37.639]  But this is how they did it.
[00:13:37.659 --> 00:13:43.163]  I remember about a month ago, I started seeing all the liberal publications going, it's a horrible bill!
[00:13:44.341 --> 00:13:47.342]  Not because it creates a Pan-American ID, not because of the data mining.
[00:13:47.763 --> 00:13:50.784]  It's a horrible bill, it'll restrict the illegal aliens!
[00:13:52.285 --> 00:13:54.225]  Over and over again, I saw these.
[00:13:55.146 --> 00:13:57.267]  And I'm like, it doesn't restrict illegal aliens!
[00:13:58.067 --> 00:14:11.433]  I mean, even World Net Daily's reported on the fact that it gives Bush basically martial law power under the name of stopping illegals, but when Bush gets 2,000 more Border Patrol funded, when Congress funds it, he goes in and takes it out.
[00:14:13.277 --> 00:14:14.317]  I mean, that's the point here.
[00:14:14.337 --> 00:14:16.318]  I mean, even Neocon Worldnet Daily!
[00:14:17.178 --> 00:14:19.178]  They're better than a lot of them out there, I have to admit.
[00:14:20.298 --> 00:14:25.039]  They even have to admit that it doesn't really stop illegals.
[00:14:26.239 --> 00:14:32.761]  But the liberal publications come out, and they scream bloody murder that it's going to stop illegals.
[00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:37.541]  Conservatives see that, and man, they're lining up now to support this.
[00:14:39.062 --> 00:14:40.182]  It's sophisticated.
[00:14:41.613 --> 00:14:44.855]  It really is sophisticated how they do this.
[00:14:45.035 --> 00:14:54.399]  And I don't even think these Democratic websites are doing this from some governmental funded point.
[00:14:55.199 --> 00:15:00.201]  I don't think it's a Jeff Gannon or Armstrong Williams type garbage.
[00:15:01.022 --> 00:15:05.844]  Because I've talked to these people, I call them up and they go, oh you're right, and change their analysis.
[00:15:07.066 --> 00:15:08.807]  Just like the phony conservatives.
[00:15:09.348 --> 00:15:11.870]  Most of them don't even know they're phony conservatives.
[00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.312]  They just hear Democrats who are against it.
[00:15:14.772 --> 00:15:16.814]  And so, my goodness, it must be good!
[00:15:18.516 --> 00:15:20.578]  We've got to get out of this left-right paradigm.
[00:15:20.618 --> 00:15:23.761]  It just turns off the thinking process.
[00:15:24.341 --> 00:15:25.582]  It's the same thing with Schwarzenegger.
[00:15:25.842 --> 00:15:30.747]  Close the borders, pass Bush's guest worker program.
[00:15:33.422 --> 00:15:34.342]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:15:34.402 --> 00:15:38.564]  It's like, we need to secure your front door at night, so let's take it off the hinges.
[00:15:39.244 --> 00:15:40.925]  Then you'll never forget to lock it again.
[00:15:41.746 --> 00:15:46.848]  Oh, you keep forgetting to lock your front door, so we'll just take it off its hinges and you won't have a door.
[00:15:48.508 --> 00:15:51.770]  You won't even have a screen door without a latch.
[00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:56.512]  You'll just have an open door and then there'll be no more problems with locking your front door.
[00:15:56.552 --> 00:16:01.714]  I mean, that's... I'm trying to use a new analogy or parallel here.
[00:16:03.081 --> 00:16:16.064]  I've used the one of saying there'll be no more murder in 2005, the government announces, because we're going to legalize murder and change the name of murder to, uh, Snow Cone.
[00:16:18.384 --> 00:16:19.684]  And we're going to say it's a good thing.
[00:16:20.445 --> 00:16:22.305]  I mean, it's that crazy.
[00:16:22.425 --> 00:16:27.266]  It makes no sense if you just research it, but they're counting on you not to.
[00:16:29.275 --> 00:16:33.777]  And we have, you know, good people who mean well on this show and they don't even understand it.
[00:16:34.198 --> 00:16:36.519]  And they get all emotional and want to argue about it.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:39.180]  Well, just watch.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:40.741]  They'll probably pass this bill.
[00:16:42.665 --> 00:16:48.388]  Today or tomorrow, they may extend the session, or it may happen on Monday or Tuesday.
[00:16:48.608 --> 00:16:49.568]  We're trying to fight it.
[00:16:49.608 --> 00:16:51.129]  We're trying to get provisions out.
[00:16:51.449 --> 00:16:54.991]  We've gotten some provisions out, but as soon as we do that, we get a new version.
[00:16:55.011 --> 00:17:01.634]  The provisions are right back in under some new section, slightly changed in their wording and semantics.
[00:17:03.334 --> 00:17:05.856]  And now Schwarzenegger is commending the Minutemen.
[00:17:08.177 --> 00:17:10.958]  And then he'll be condemning them tomorrow.
[00:17:11.542 --> 00:17:12.643]  Both sides of his mouth.
[00:17:13.464 --> 00:17:25.113]  That's just meant to neutralize conservatives in his state that are finally looking at his record of being an Enron lackey, of being pro-abortion, pro-open border, vehemently anti-gun.
[00:17:26.595 --> 00:17:28.116]  The Democrats are now against him.
[00:17:28.636 --> 00:17:30.218]  The Republicans are now against him.
[00:17:30.458 --> 00:17:33.040]  And don't worry, they play this game all the time.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:38.484]  The media loves, once somebody's already been elected, to lower their poll numbers and then raise them back up again.
[00:17:38.504 --> 00:17:40.306]  This is all just part of the process.
[00:17:41.104 --> 00:17:44.446]  And Schwarzenegger's running around doing this.
[00:17:44.506 --> 00:17:45.347]  It's just amazing.
[00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:49.049]  Also, coming up, U.S.
[00:17:49.069 --> 00:17:51.011]  releases war-dead photographs.
[00:17:51.031 --> 00:17:52.572]  The question is, why are they doing that?
[00:17:52.592 --> 00:17:55.013]  Well, they were ordered to, via lawsuits.
[00:17:55.534 --> 00:18:06.461]  C-SPAN had canceled airing David Ray Griffin's talk on the new Pearl Harbor, but they are now going to be airing it tomorrow morning, thanks to pressure.
[00:18:07.162 --> 00:18:08.963]  And I want to commend C-SPAN.
[00:18:09.907 --> 00:18:11.448]  So we'll be telling you about that later.
[00:18:11.908 --> 00:18:14.410]  Brain Scan sees hidden thoughts.
[00:18:15.431 --> 00:18:17.992]  And these are already in five airports in the U.S.
[00:18:19.073 --> 00:18:21.634]  And now they're talking about putting them up everywhere.
[00:18:22.215 --> 00:18:25.557]  Just to, you know, scan our brains on the street corners.
[00:18:26.538 --> 00:18:27.618]  You think I'm joking, folks?
[00:18:27.658 --> 00:18:28.759]  Wait until it comes to your town.
[00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:39.399]  I've already put biometrics up all over the country that read your walk and decide if you're aggressive or angry and then that's the police's excuse to come search you.
[00:18:39.459 --> 00:18:45.705]  It's total scientific quackery and fraud, but hey, who are you to disprove the black box?
[00:18:46.246 --> 00:18:48.168]  You know, you're not allowed to look at the black box.
[00:18:48.208 --> 00:18:52.692]  It's proprietary, but it says you're a terrorist, so... U.S.
[00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:53.093]  aid?
[00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:57.423]  Sees nuclear arms advancing by North Korea.
[00:18:57.904 --> 00:18:59.465]  Jail population explodes in the U.S.
[00:18:59.525 --> 00:19:00.686]  and also in England.
[00:19:01.206 --> 00:19:02.568]  All over the western world.
[00:19:03.789 --> 00:19:05.050]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:06.911]  There is so much news coming up.
[00:19:07.292 --> 00:19:09.454]  But I'm going to take some calls first when we get back.
[00:19:09.954 --> 00:19:12.416]  Then I want to get into sperm counts plunging.
[00:19:13.977 --> 00:19:20.984]  I want to get into plant pollen and other forms of
[00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:28.852]  Plant flora that use other forms of germination and reproduction.
[00:19:29.752 --> 00:19:30.932]  They're producing pollen.
[00:19:30.992 --> 00:19:31.832]  It's just dead.
[00:19:32.593 --> 00:19:34.373]  It's just like sperm in men.
[00:19:36.353 --> 00:19:37.794]  We still have plenty of sperm.
[00:19:37.874 --> 00:19:40.314]  It's retarded, basically.
[00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:42.895]  And it doesn't have a tail.
[00:19:43.415 --> 00:19:45.016]  It's got corrupt data in it.
[00:19:46.336 --> 00:19:46.556]  It's bad.
[00:19:47.654 --> 00:19:55.064]  It's real bad, and cancer exploding, and deformities exploding in the troops, children, and in the Iraqis.
[00:19:55.765 --> 00:19:59.610]  But DU's good for you, so breathe lots of it, because the government says so.
[00:20:01.579 --> 00:20:08.203]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of oregasin, oreganol, oregamax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[00:20:08.564 --> 00:20:19.751]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P7-3 oil, in particular the P7-3 oregasin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose, with a 100% kill.
[00:20:21.132 --> 00:20:25.953]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural urban spice products from North American Urban Spice.

[00:21:03.030 --> 00:21:04.071]  The War on Terrorism.

[00:21:07.436 --> 00:21:11.601]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:12.041 --> 00:21:12.863]  So what do you do?
[00:21:13.183 --> 00:21:17.749]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:18.229 --> 00:21:20.350]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:04.361]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[00:24:01.604 --> 00:24:07.246]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:07.266 --> 00:24:26.171]  You notice the phony environmental groups, when you go to one of their big meetings, it'll be at a giant, palatial, four or five star hotel.
[00:24:26.531 --> 00:24:28.932]  I guess hotels are four star, restaurants are five star.
[00:24:31.258 --> 00:24:36.079]  It'll be bank chairmen and government leaders and it's all about business.
[00:24:36.099 --> 00:24:37.479]  It's all about taking your property.
[00:24:37.919 --> 00:24:39.079]  All about taxing you.
[00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:40.120]  They laugh about it.
[00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.800]  They'll even admit it to your face.
[00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:44.060]  It's disgusting.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:47.941]  But the environmentalists, they don't want to talk about plunging sperm counts.
[00:24:48.681 --> 00:24:53.142]  They don't want to talk about what's happening to the actual biosphere itself.
[00:24:53.182 --> 00:24:59.703]  The deformities in the plants, in the mammals, in the reptiles.
[00:25:00.693 --> 00:25:04.514]  They don't want to discuss what genetic engineering's been doing.
[00:25:05.714 --> 00:25:08.255]  No, they just want to get your property.
[00:25:09.215 --> 00:25:12.436]  They just want to restrict you and tax and regulate you.
[00:25:13.256 --> 00:25:26.100]  You know, they'll tell you we should pay a big tax on our energy use to the United Nations, but then China and 160 other countries have no restrictions on their countries, and that's where all the development and most of the pollution is taking place.
[00:25:27.381 --> 00:25:30.562]  See, it's all designed to shift wealth out of the country.
[00:25:31.102 --> 00:25:34.443]  And to shift wealth to third world nations that are already totally enslaved.
[00:25:36.124 --> 00:25:37.804]  Alright, I don't want to rant and rave about this anymore.
[00:25:37.824 --> 00:25:38.605]  I'll get into it later.
[00:25:39.405 --> 00:25:41.266]  Let's talk to Russell in Florida.
[00:25:42.426 --> 00:25:44.367]  Then we'll go to other calls as well.
[00:25:44.407 --> 00:25:45.267]  Russell, welcome.
[00:25:45.567 --> 00:25:46.767]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:25:47.047 --> 00:25:51.389]  Alex, I want to thank you for all your unselfish, tireless efforts in exposing the New World Order.
[00:25:51.869 --> 00:25:54.810]  You've really sacrificed a lot in your personal life to
[00:25:55.871 --> 00:26:10.986]  Well, I appreciate the compliments, and I do whine somewhat or talk about how much I'm working, but really that's usually to describe to a listener why I can't do something personally for them or why I don't respond to everybody's emails.
[00:26:11.646 --> 00:26:14.069]  But really, I have an exciting, fun life, and I'm blessed.
[00:26:14.129 --> 00:26:14.569]  I'm thankful.
[00:26:14.869 --> 00:26:18.133]  Well, you've said you've been empowered by this, and I would agree.
[00:26:18.213 --> 00:26:20.475]  When you know the truth, you become empowered.
[00:26:21.432 --> 00:26:25.334]  Can I comment on what you were just talking about before I make a comment about your martial law?
[00:26:25.414 --> 00:26:26.674]  You can comment on whatever you want, sir.
[00:26:26.895 --> 00:26:27.815]  Okay.
[00:26:28.195 --> 00:26:36.539]  Regarding the Real National ID Act and the borders, and you can probably confirm this, I think that the globalists use a Galean principle.
[00:26:36.579 --> 00:26:42.201]  They let things get so bad with illegal immigration, illegal aliens.
[00:26:42.241 --> 00:26:43.882]  They let things get so bad with the economy.
[00:26:44.318 --> 00:26:45.598]  That then they offer a solution.
[00:26:45.618 --> 00:26:47.259]  Well, here's a national ID card.
[00:26:47.579 --> 00:26:52.101]  Oh, by the way, we're going to block borders now, but not for the illegal immigrants, but for the American people.
[00:26:52.501 --> 00:27:02.804]  And then they produce garbage trade agreements like CAFTA and FDAA, which really further their goal toward world government.
[00:27:02.984 --> 00:27:10.207]  By the way, in those agreements, it says that vehicles will travel at 70 miles an hour across the southern and northern borders.
[00:27:10.587 --> 00:27:11.987]  There is going to be no border.
[00:27:12.327 --> 00:27:13.688]  It's the official plan
[00:27:14.662 --> 00:27:16.443]  And, uh, exactly.
[00:27:16.463 --> 00:27:17.064]  No, no.
[00:27:17.124 --> 00:27:18.685]  I mean, that's not your opinion.
[00:27:18.725 --> 00:27:19.685]  That's what's happened here.
[00:27:20.346 --> 00:27:25.789]  I mean, poor Terry Anderson, who we had on yesterday, and the caller Ron in New York was right.
[00:27:26.289 --> 00:27:27.970]  You know, Terry's like, I just want something.
[00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:29.111]  I just want to stop them.
[00:27:29.471 --> 00:27:30.692]  Because he's been in D.C.
[00:27:30.732 --> 00:27:39.718]  at these dinners with these Republicans, and they've, you know, he's at these cocktail meetings with these congressmen, and they're manipulating him and so many others.
[00:27:40.318 --> 00:27:41.359]  Yeah, I listened to that.
[00:27:41.399 --> 00:27:41.739]  You're right.
[00:27:43.976 --> 00:27:46.356]  Regarding your video, and then I have a question.
[00:27:46.756 --> 00:27:50.957]  Alex, I want to bring up a very important point I overlooked at first, and this relates to Bohemian Grove.
[00:27:51.797 --> 00:28:05.780]  When you made dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove, I wasn't convinced of its importance, but upon reviewing the David Gergen portion of your Martial Law DVD again last night, it truly exposed these globalists at the highest levels of our government and what they are.
[00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:08.060]  They're basically devil-worshipping sodomites.
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:13.401]  And Gergen confirmed the rituals and his membership, as well as the membership of other
[00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:17.087]  Now let's be clear, we don't know that specifically about Gergen.
[00:28:26.013 --> 00:28:26.734]  Well, we don't know that.
[00:28:26.794 --> 00:28:34.139]  We know he goes there and is in attendance with the rituals, but we do not know about him and all the male prostitutes.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:38.002]  We know the male prostitutes, the gay porn stars, are there.
[00:28:38.963 --> 00:28:42.946]  We just don't know if David Gergen, if that's his cup of tea.
[00:28:42.986 --> 00:28:50.832]  He made a very interesting statement, which you highlighted in your Martial Law DVD, that he doesn't run around naked and didn't
[00:28:51.826 --> 00:28:54.208]  Didn't President Nixon say basically the same thing?
[00:28:54.308 --> 00:29:04.819]  I don't run around naked and it's the most... Yeah, Nixon said it's the most GD, faggy thing you've ever seen at Bohemian Grove.
[00:29:05.259 --> 00:29:10.724]  And that had always been in Harper's Magazine, but no one had ever had the clip.
[00:29:10.784 --> 00:29:14.268]  Well, the Presidential Library, two years ago, released it.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:22.225]  Well, you were in Bohemian Grove, and it wasn't really clear on your video what you witnessed, probably because you couldn't film it.
[00:29:22.626 --> 00:29:25.288]  But did you see acts of homosexuality going on there?
[00:29:25.488 --> 00:29:27.990]  And just the weirdest things you can imagine?
[00:29:29.531 --> 00:29:30.833]  I'll tell you about that on the other side.
[00:29:30.873 --> 00:29:31.513]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:32.634 --> 00:29:39.099]  And, uh, Bohemian Grove, folks, is about, eh, probably 14 minutes of this three-hour film.
[00:29:39.119 --> 00:29:40.400]  I mean, it's a miniseries.
[00:29:40.961 --> 00:29:41.701]  It's three films.
[00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:44.704]  And it's all documented.
[00:29:46.132 --> 00:29:47.034]  I'll tell you about it when we get back.
[00:29:47.074 --> 00:29:47.715]  We'll take more calls.
[00:29:47.735 --> 00:29:49.919]  Stay with us.
[00:29:52.363 --> 00:29:53.285]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.745 --> 00:29:55.368]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.388 --> 00:29:58.954]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:09.518]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.938 --> 00:30:14.179]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.399 --> 00:30:21.441]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.821 --> 00:30:27.923]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:28.063 --> 00:30:29.283]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.623 --> 00:30:32.587]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:32.727 --> 00:30:34.769]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:35.070 --> 00:30:42.298]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:45.983]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:30:46.403 --> 00:30:51.069]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:04.347]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.667 --> 00:31:09.588]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.848 --> 00:31:14.209]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.489 --> 00:31:23.411]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.611 --> 00:31:27.232]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.532 --> 00:31:32.558]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.858 --> 00:31:39.585]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.066 --> 00:31:40.606]  What about you?
[00:31:41.366 --> 00:31:46.272]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[00:32:07.071 --> 00:32:11.992]  If you think bankruptcy is the only way out, then pay close attention because relief is on the way!

[00:32:26.677 --> 00:32:29.759]  In most cases, you can be debt free in less than 36 months.
[00:32:30.039 --> 00:32:33.701]  I owed so much on my credit cards, I could barely make the minimum monthly payment.
[00:32:33.841 --> 00:32:36.803]  We talked about filing bankruptcy, but I was concerned about my credit.
[00:32:36.983 --> 00:32:38.984]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.
[00:32:39.184 --> 00:32:42.847]  They set up a plan for me, where I could settle for just 40% of what I owed.
[00:32:43.087 --> 00:32:46.669]  I'm back in control of my life, and I owe it all to Debt Relief USA.

[00:32:52.293 --> 00:32:52.333]  800-509-3201.
[00:32:52.353 --> 00:32:53.794]  I really do kinda skim over.
[00:33:18.684 --> 00:33:47.827]  My new documentary film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State, I haven't contacted the thousands of radio shows I've been on, which I've got a program I can fax them all or email them all to ask to be on their broadcast because hundreds would call and I'd be doing five, six, seven interviews a day and quite frankly, you know, it's kind of like I'm pausing before I stick my finger in the electricity socket
[00:33:49.087 --> 00:33:52.709]  It's something I need to do to promote the film.
[00:33:53.649 --> 00:33:54.769]  I know I need to do that.
[00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:58.991]  I haven't really written any press releases about the film.
[00:33:59.071 --> 00:33:59.911]  I haven't hyped it.
[00:34:00.071 --> 00:34:07.114]  I haven't done the little manipulative things that so many other people do to promote their films.
[00:34:09.535 --> 00:34:12.616]  I mean, I just hope that quality will sell itself.
[00:34:13.697 --> 00:34:17.118]  And I've got a lot of news and issues and callers and guests I want to talk to.
[00:34:18.426 --> 00:34:23.169]  This is, frankly, the best 9-11 film out there, and I've seen them all.
[00:34:23.810 --> 00:34:24.510]  It is the best.
[00:34:25.371 --> 00:34:33.716]  The best documented, the best produced, the most comprehensive, and it's only one hour of this three-hour film, this mini-series.
[00:34:36.137 --> 00:34:37.078]  You need to have it.
[00:34:38.619 --> 00:34:46.224]  But, again, it covers the police state, I mean, right up front as it happens, it covers 9-11, and then we show you who the globalists are.
[00:34:48.297 --> 00:34:54.302]  I'm struggling with talking about this because I don't like to get into it.
[00:34:57.025 --> 00:35:03.730]  It's so horrible that my psyche is shaken to the core.
[00:35:06.413 --> 00:35:15.841]  Last night I went to the grocery store at about 10 o'clock at night because my wife needed some things that she'd forgotten last time she went and a manager
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:43.477]  He came over to me, who I've seen a few other times, and he said, you know, I've been telling my dad about the New World Order the last few years, and he wouldn't talk about it, but he was a Mater D at a major, you know, five-star club back in the 80s, and these world leaders would come in, and they would, you know, he said that his dad said to him,
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:50.324]  Yeah, I haven't been telling you what I knew, but I was shocked that you knew about all this because I witnessed it back in the 80s.
[00:35:51.985 --> 00:35:54.727]  And this was just one more person telling me this.
[00:35:54.787 --> 00:35:56.669]  I mean, I have mainstream news articles.
[00:35:56.769 --> 00:35:58.250]  I have documents.
[00:35:58.370 --> 00:36:05.335]  I have so many other people that have told me about this living in Texas.
[00:36:07.256 --> 00:36:13.421]  And, you know, here's this guy telling me about the globalists shutting off this restaurant.
[00:36:14.861 --> 00:36:15.621]  This club.
[00:36:16.962 --> 00:36:20.943]  And then he asked questions about the things he was seeing and he was just told to shut up.
[00:36:21.883 --> 00:36:23.624]  Or you'll be sleeping with the fishes.
[00:36:24.484 --> 00:36:32.107]  And then here is this guy's dad at 70-something years old, real sick, on the edge of dying and now he's telling his son all this stuff.
[00:36:33.107 --> 00:36:36.568]  This guy was telling me this stuff and then I just went to the grocery store.
[00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:37.788]  I was just sick.
[00:36:38.909 --> 00:36:42.790]  And I started, I had tears running down my cheeks and I'm just so sick of it.
[00:36:43.752 --> 00:36:46.414]  I mean, evil is real and it threatens all of us.
[00:36:49.256 --> 00:36:56.982]  And we're talking about the stuff that John DeCamp discusses and others and let me just tell you it's all true, folks.
[00:36:57.042 --> 00:36:59.324]  It's a lot worse than what even he talks about.
[00:37:01.145 --> 00:37:11.133]  And it's so alien to us, so alien to normal people who have a conscience, who feel remorse,
[00:37:13.041 --> 00:37:18.244]  The things that Ted Bundy did are so alien that it's hard for us to believe.
[00:37:18.284 --> 00:37:24.888]  It's so alien what Charlie Manson did, what Jeffrey Dahmer did, what these individuals do.
[00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:33.313]  And we're very naive and it's time for us to stop being childlike, unfortunately.
[00:37:33.413 --> 00:37:34.074]  We're adults.
[00:37:34.914 --> 00:37:39.397]  We have to face up to what's going on in this world.
[00:37:42.214 --> 00:37:50.738]  And what shocked me is the thing that this gentleman was telling me was something that I already had from other high-level sources that no one even knows about.
[00:37:52.379 --> 00:38:00.723]  There's a lot of things I know that are frankly so shocking and so painful.
[00:38:04.225 --> 00:38:05.025]  I mean they make
[00:38:06.295 --> 00:38:13.480]  George Bush and his boyfriend Jeff Gannon look absolutely tame in comparison.
[00:38:15.321 --> 00:38:20.605]  That is literally one snowflake on the tip of an iceberg.
[00:38:22.446 --> 00:38:25.468]  The people we're facing revel in evil.
[00:38:27.269 --> 00:38:33.233]  They are more wicked than any Hollywood horror movie you could ever imagine.
[00:38:33.273 --> 00:38:34.434]  They are literally
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:39:03.625]  the bowels of hell they are the puke of maggots they are the sinners of black holes they are pure unadulterated one hundred and ten percent devil
[00:39:05.994 --> 00:39:17.842]  And we sit here, naively bumbling through life, self-centered, worried about our own enjoyments, a game of golf, a little football game.
[00:39:20.083 --> 00:39:30.150]  We're so worried about gratifying ourselves, we don't even spend time with our families, with our children, educating them, raising them up straight and strong.
[00:39:33.627 --> 00:39:43.969]  Not to mention the fact that we're not involved politically, we're not involved civically, we're not involved spiritually, we're not involved in knowing how our government works.
[00:39:44.029 --> 00:39:55.791]  We know all the baseball and football scores, but we have no conception of what the Seventh Amendment is, what the Ninth Amendment is, which I think is the most important.
[00:39:58.611 --> 00:40:02.592]  We don't even know what our heritage is, and so we don't understand
[00:40:03.402 --> 00:40:06.324]  That we're going into tyranny because we never knew what freedom was to begin with.
[00:40:08.446 --> 00:40:19.635]  And, you know, the sincerity of this individual, that was a manager at a major grocery store, and how freaked out he was.
[00:40:19.695 --> 00:40:30.363]  You know, I was telling him all that about the New World Order, and he's this conservative guy, and he's about to die, and he just dumps all this on me, and then I'm sitting there listening to this, and I'd already been told this by people in Midland,
[00:40:31.622 --> 00:40:36.445]  And it just so happens I went to college with somebody who knew the Bushes.
[00:40:36.465 --> 00:40:37.346]  You know what?
[00:40:37.406 --> 00:40:38.487]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[00:40:38.507 --> 00:40:40.768]  I'm just going to stop right there.
[00:40:41.849 --> 00:40:44.351]  Because I don't think you're ready to deal with this, folks.
[00:40:44.711 --> 00:40:50.095]  And frankly, I've got a lot of battles to fight, and it wouldn't matter how much evidence of this we had.
[00:40:50.695 --> 00:40:52.316]  They're not going to go down for this, ever.
[00:40:53.117 --> 00:40:57.320]  Because this is a rite of passage for the globalists to compromise themselves.
[00:41:00.094 --> 00:41:16.079]  It is a sacrament to them, and so many corrupt corporations, so many corrupt people that aren't involved in one-tenth the wickedness that high-level globalists are, know it's going on, and they'll protect them, because their power is tied up with the globalist power.
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:18.200]  And that's really what evil is.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:29.404]  That's one of its greatest games, is getting you to buy into its system, even though you know it's a lie, even though you know it's evil, even though you know it's a fraud, you still
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:46.692]  You still go along with it because your house and your boat and your wife and your bank accounts and your golf club membership and so you just rationalize and make excuses and you're going to protect this system.
[00:41:51.977 --> 00:41:54.959]  I mean it shakes me to my core.
[00:41:55.199 --> 00:41:59.943]  I was sitting out under the stars last night at about 1am in my backyard just looking up
[00:42:01.642 --> 00:42:03.664]  And I just hit my knees.
[00:42:03.684 --> 00:42:13.430]  I just asked God to just give me guidance to fight this and to give us all guidance and to help me deal with the pain because it just tears my heart out.
[00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:14.451]  It tears my guts out.
[00:42:14.491 --> 00:42:15.672]  It hurts right now bad.
[00:42:17.953 --> 00:42:23.057]  Because when you love life and when you know that what comes around goes around, you reap what you sow.
[00:42:24.858 --> 00:42:26.700]  I mean, I'm part of the body politic.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.182]  I am just a cell in the flesh that is humanity.
[00:42:32.449 --> 00:42:46.221]  My family, everyone I love, is just a little cluster of cells in this larger colony of creatures that we call human beings.
[00:42:47.742 --> 00:42:54.448]  And what goes on around us comes back on us, even if we're not part of it.
[00:42:57.313 --> 00:42:59.995]  And, uh, that is where empathy comes from.
[00:43:00.215 --> 00:43:10.120]  You know, you feel for someone that something bad is happening to, even if you don't know them, because you associate it with yourself, because that's normal programming that God gave us.
[00:43:12.521 --> 00:43:26.689]  And these yuppies out there, and trendies, and the rest of them, uh, the good old boys that think they've hit the top of the pyramid, they think they're part of the power elite because they got a couple million bucks, and that's chicken feed, that's lower middle class,
[00:43:28.902 --> 00:43:30.284]  They think they're part of this system.
[00:43:31.865 --> 00:43:33.487]  And so they defend this system.
[00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:37.451]  And they think it's a strength.
[00:43:37.551 --> 00:43:38.752]  They think it's an attribute.
[00:43:39.433 --> 00:43:40.514]  They think it's a plus.
[00:43:41.875 --> 00:43:44.578]  They're proud of themselves that, okay, whatever.
[00:43:45.519 --> 00:43:45.959]  You know what?
[00:43:45.999 --> 00:43:47.140]  I just worry about me.
[00:43:48.301 --> 00:43:49.723]  I'm not going to get involved in that.
[00:43:50.664 --> 00:43:51.965]  I just worry about myself.
[00:43:52.045 --> 00:43:52.866]  I'm going to get ahead.
[00:43:56.608 --> 00:44:03.532]  And then, when you're in trouble, when this system's feeding on you, your neighbors aren't going to help you.
[00:44:04.913 --> 00:44:07.035]  I mean, that's why you've got that terror.
[00:44:07.115 --> 00:44:08.476]  That's why you've got that horror.
[00:44:09.196 --> 00:44:11.758]  Back in the back of your mind and the pit of your stomach out there.
[00:44:11.778 --> 00:44:13.139]  That's why you're so unhappy.
[00:44:14.279 --> 00:44:16.841]  That's why you're always looking for more and more gratification.
[00:44:17.321 --> 00:44:18.842]  That's why you're fronting.
[00:44:19.703 --> 00:44:24.846]  Or, um... I love that term they use in the ghetto, fronting.
[00:44:25.888 --> 00:44:27.209]  Or, you know, strutting.
[00:44:27.749 --> 00:44:31.712]  I see these people in restaurants and stores, and they're so self-centered.
[00:44:31.732 --> 00:44:39.758]  They're looking at how people are looking at them, and they're strutting around, and they're jiggling the watch on their arm, and they're feeling powerful.
[00:44:39.778 --> 00:44:40.778]  They're like peacocks.
[00:44:41.679 --> 00:44:43.740]  We're not meant to be peacocks, folks.
[00:44:44.621 --> 00:44:46.162]  And again, this gets so complex.
[00:44:48.203 --> 00:44:54.968]  We're just so decadent, but I mean, just to try to even describe what I'm seeing in my mind's eye right now,
[00:44:56.488 --> 00:45:10.719]  Just these pampered creatures that are so soft, and when you talk to them, they're so self-centered.
[00:45:10.739 --> 00:45:11.660]  They're so stupid.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.942]  They've limited their thoughts.
[00:45:14.482 --> 00:45:16.023]  They've limited their world view.
[00:45:17.384 --> 00:45:21.928]  By being self-centered, they've shut themselves off to 98% of what life really is.
[00:45:22.549 --> 00:45:25.812]  And when they look at you, they look at you in a sardonic fashion.
[00:45:26.172 --> 00:45:27.193]  They assess you.
[00:45:27.813 --> 00:45:38.662]  They try to put you into a false cookie-cutter mold so that they... and you see them having delusions of grandeur while you're talking to them.
[00:45:41.024 --> 00:45:42.985]  And it doesn't give me a sardonic feeling.
[00:45:43.005 --> 00:45:44.307]  It gives me a sickening feeling.
[00:45:44.627 --> 00:45:50.892]  To other members of the elite, though, above these low-level minions, they enjoy
[00:45:52.073 --> 00:45:53.234]  They understand this.
[00:45:53.294 --> 00:45:54.434]  They know what's going on.
[00:45:54.495 --> 00:46:00.137]  They pull the strings and flip the dials and punch the buttons that control all of this.
[00:46:03.659 --> 00:46:05.400]  And I just see these slaves everywhere.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.321]  And I just feel sorry for them.
[00:46:09.142 --> 00:46:10.703]  I mean, my life is invigorating.
[00:46:10.763 --> 00:46:11.543]  It's empowered.
[00:46:11.583 --> 00:46:12.384]  It's dynamic.
[00:46:13.544 --> 00:46:18.407]  But also, it is painful.
[00:46:19.727 --> 00:46:21.108]  It is extremely painful.
[00:46:22.452 --> 00:46:25.233]  To know just how evil the globalists are.
[00:46:26.153 --> 00:46:29.915]  I mean, let me use examples that I've been using a lot lately that we know about that are admitted.
[00:46:30.735 --> 00:46:39.839]  They take eight-year-olds, seven-year-olds, in some cases two-year-olds, children from poor families in New York, and they take them and they feed them pesticides.
[00:46:40.139 --> 00:46:41.679]  And a lot of these children die.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.741]  And then when you hear about it, here's an example.
[00:46:45.861 --> 00:46:48.162]  See, there's so many facets to everything, it's hard to describe it all.
[00:46:48.782 --> 00:46:49.682]  This is all interconnected.
[00:46:49.722 --> 00:46:51.683]  It's hard to talk about one thing and not talk about everything.
[00:46:52.375 --> 00:46:55.916]  Let's say a New York Daily News article, or a New York Post article.
[00:46:56.176 --> 00:47:01.478]  The headline will be, they took HIV children and gave them experimental drugs that they knew killed people.
[00:47:02.678 --> 00:47:06.180]  And then you think, well, they were trying to save them, even though these are experimental drugs.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:10.301]  But you read deeper, it says, oh, by the way, they took kids that didn't have HIV and gave it to them.
[00:47:12.241 --> 00:47:13.622]  But that's a minor footnote, see?
[00:47:14.622 --> 00:47:16.323]  So they're like titrating the dose.
[00:47:18.331 --> 00:47:33.840]  They're building you up to the venom and the evil, getting you used to it, basting you in it, titrating the dose, I think that's the term, where you take a little bit of snake venom, and over time they build it up until you can drink a gallon of it, basically, until you're addicted to it, almost.
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:46.567]  So they just take the least part of the evil and put that in the front of the article to try to convince you to it, and then later they admit, oh by the way, they take healthy children and feed them pesticides.
[00:47:47.341 --> 00:47:49.943]  And watch him die.
[00:47:49.963 --> 00:47:53.746]  They take articles and they say, oh yeah, they locked him up in the gas chamber.
[00:47:53.766 --> 00:47:55.968]  He volunteered.
[00:47:55.988 --> 00:47:58.270]  They told him they were just testing a common cold bug on him.
[00:47:58.811 --> 00:48:05.436]  They took the young sergeant and sprayed nerve gas on him and killed him and they dissected his body.
[00:48:06.777 --> 00:48:10.460]  Or yeah, Joseph Mingala did advise the CIA
[00:48:13.118 --> 00:48:17.442]  Or yeah, you know, in the mid-eighties they did spray nerve gas on troops in England, U.S.
[00:48:17.462 --> 00:48:18.563]  and British troops and kill them.
[00:48:18.603 --> 00:48:20.845]  Or they did release plague bombs on Scotland.
[00:48:20.885 --> 00:48:26.650]  Or oh yeah, they did give the gay men in New York with the hepatitis shots an autoimmune virus.
[00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:27.230]  And meh.
[00:48:27.810 --> 00:48:34.236]  And oh, they did put a chemical in the tetanus shots for women in Africa that sterilized them.
[00:48:34.256 --> 00:48:37.479]  But maybe we do need to get rid of the population, you know?
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:40.061]  And so,
[00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:42.621]  You know, we sit here.
[00:48:42.641 --> 00:48:43.681]  I mean, this is the admitted.
[00:48:43.701 --> 00:48:44.722]  There's hundreds of these.
[00:48:45.642 --> 00:48:47.962]  It's hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.
[00:48:48.283 --> 00:48:49.503]  And you trust these people.
[00:48:49.543 --> 00:48:50.823]  You go along with these people.
[00:48:51.563 --> 00:49:01.286]  And, you know, the caller mentioned, uh... The caller mentioned David Gergen.
[00:49:01.306 --> 00:49:03.226]  I mean, I just walk up to him and go, can I interview you?
[00:49:03.266 --> 00:49:05.206]  This is the Karl Rove of four administrations.
[00:49:05.566 --> 00:49:06.687]  I go, what about the rituals?
[00:49:06.747 --> 00:49:07.507]  And he gets mad.
[00:49:08.937 --> 00:49:12.599]  And he says, I'm not going to tell you about the rituals, and he goes, I go there, I'm not going to talk about it.
[00:49:13.359 --> 00:49:17.661]  He blows up and gets in my face, and we show all the news articles and documents.
[00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:24.683]  Can you imagine if it came out in the news that Bill Clinton attended a club where they busked in male prostitutes?
[00:49:25.444 --> 00:49:31.386]  I mean, they just admit this in major public papers, and then Christians don't want to talk about it.
[00:49:33.867 --> 00:49:36.148]  I mean, it's now popping up all over the news.
[00:49:37.774 --> 00:49:39.536]  All over the place.
[00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:44.640]  Major publications are going a hair breadth from admitting that Bush is bisexual.
[00:49:45.821 --> 00:49:47.262]  But again, that's just the start of it.
[00:49:47.303 --> 00:49:54.869]  Folks, it's the bribery, it's the extortion, it's the blackmail that they have over these presidents with this.
[00:49:55.230 --> 00:49:57.111]  With Bill Clinton, it's cocaine and rape.
[00:49:58.532 --> 00:50:03.437]  And with the Bushes, it's stuff even worse.
[00:50:08.131 --> 00:50:12.474]  We're going to break here and I will go to your calls.
[00:50:12.814 --> 00:50:14.155]  We'll hurry through them.
[00:50:14.195 --> 00:50:16.917]  I know we've had loaded phone lines for 45 minutes.
[00:50:19.839 --> 00:50:22.081]  We'll take your calls after we get back from break.
[00:50:24.763 --> 00:50:25.583]  I've researched it.
[00:50:25.643 --> 00:50:26.244]  It's real.
[00:50:26.324 --> 00:50:26.844]  It's true.
[00:50:26.944 --> 00:50:28.826]  They really are Luciferians.
[00:50:29.366 --> 00:50:31.147]  They really do bad things.
[00:50:32.248 --> 00:50:34.890]  They really do love blood.
[00:50:36.432 --> 00:50:38.653]  And you need to understand that.
[00:50:39.533 --> 00:50:40.933]  You need to know that.
[00:50:41.793 --> 00:50:43.514]  They've got control of the nuclear weapons.
[00:50:43.554 --> 00:50:44.874]  They've got control of the police.
[00:50:45.474 --> 00:50:47.114]  They've got control of the vaccines.
[00:50:48.195 --> 00:50:53.576]  And the bigger the police state gets, the more control they get, the more bad things they're going to do to us.
[00:50:53.656 --> 00:50:55.236]  And we're all in danger.
[00:50:55.917 --> 00:50:57.957]  We're in grave danger.
[00:51:01.713 --> 00:51:06.037]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.217 --> 00:51:10.642]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.802 --> 00:51:15.166]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.206 --> 00:51:16.568]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.348 --> 00:51:18.309]  Panama.
[00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:22.571]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.631 --> 00:51:29.576]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.696 --> 00:51:31.777]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.037 --> 00:51:42.423]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.443 --> 00:51:43.524]  If you want to understand
[00:51:43.784 --> 00:51:44.105]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:52:14.278 --> 00:52:18.944]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.

[00:52:26.532 --> 00:52:38.304]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[00:54:02.364 --> 00:54:05.126]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:54:05.146 --> 00:54:09.050]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.732 --> 00:54:17.056]  The globalists have a religion of death, a religion of exercising power.
[00:54:18.478 --> 00:54:19.919]  They are the priests of power.
[00:54:21.180 --> 00:54:29.507]  They see it as a plus that they feed on life, that they sap its life force, that they revel in destroying innocence.
[00:54:30.683 --> 00:54:31.724]  Social Darwinism.
[00:54:31.784 --> 00:54:36.107]  They believe that it is survival of the fittest, that they are ruthless and destructive.
[00:54:36.207 --> 00:54:38.088]  No, they are a cancer.
[00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:41.691]  A cancer is not superior because it kills its host.
[00:54:43.712 --> 00:54:56.301]  And my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 rise of the police state, exposes the police state, 9-11, and it spends a full hour on the cult of death, the order of death, the order of the death shed,
[00:54:57.384 --> 00:55:05.787]  On what the Illuminati really is, and on how Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, and the Nazis, and the Bushes, and Schwarzenegger, all tie into it.
[00:55:06.967 --> 00:55:08.548]  And you'll see the same M.O.
[00:55:08.668 --> 00:55:10.108]  in all their backgrounds.
[00:55:11.269 --> 00:55:14.230]  The same operations, the exact same thing.
[00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:20.732]  And it is my masterpiece, and I want you to have it.
[00:55:21.832 --> 00:55:23.233]  It's, I've been saying $25.95, it's actually $24.95.
[00:55:26.292 --> 00:55:27.153]  I don't think so.
[00:55:46.647 --> 00:55:47.968]  Still one of our most effective.
[00:55:48.489 --> 00:55:50.890]  Police state, three total enslavement, Matrix of Evil.
[00:55:51.431 --> 00:55:52.572]  You need to have these films.
[00:55:52.612 --> 00:55:58.797]  I mean, Matrix of Evil, just for Ron Paul giving a speech in Texas, where he says the government's creating a world government.
[00:55:59.157 --> 00:56:00.939]  Those in Washington want world government.
[00:56:00.979 --> 00:56:03.080]  I mean, it's the truth, folks.
[00:56:03.961 --> 00:56:05.382]  You need to have these films.
[00:56:05.482 --> 00:56:07.364]  Big discounts, a bunch of different specials.
[00:56:07.784 --> 00:56:09.285]  Just call and ask about the specials.

[00:56:23.730 --> 00:56:26.050]  I mean, help us expose this trash.
[00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:32.411]  They're counting on you to not take action, folks.
[00:56:32.431 --> 00:56:40.753]  1-888-253-3139 or order hard copies of my films and books and other films we carry at InfoWars.com right now off the secure online shopping cart.

[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:55.001]  15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:56:55.541 --> 00:56:56.601]  Please don't wait.
[00:56:57.601 --> 00:56:59.802]  Let's go to Charisse in Virginia.
[00:56:59.842 --> 00:57:00.402]  Thanks for holding.
[00:57:00.422 --> 00:57:00.762]  Go ahead.
[00:57:01.443 --> 00:57:04.223]  Hi Alex, I'm actually in upstate New York, but that's okay.
[00:57:04.383 --> 00:57:05.084]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:57:05.104 --> 00:57:06.544]  I was told... That's alright.
[00:57:07.252 --> 00:57:09.874]  What I wanted to ask you about was Social Security.
[00:57:10.735 --> 00:57:23.486]  So last night, I didn't see the speech, but I read that Bush said the reason that Social Security is in trouble is because there are all these IOUs in the Social Security fund that can't be paid back.
[00:57:24.126 --> 00:57:29.651]  Well, at the time when I got into the Social Security system, it said two things.
[00:57:29.751 --> 00:57:34.495]  It was that one, that your Social Security number was not to be used for identification.
[00:57:35.206 --> 00:57:36.687]  Even said that on the card.
[00:57:36.827 --> 00:57:37.488]  Exactly.
[00:57:38.068 --> 00:57:49.256]  And also it said that this money would be put into a fund that would not be touched and it would be there for you in the event that you became... Listen, whatever the government says, 90% of the time it's the opposite.
[00:57:49.717 --> 00:57:53.199]  Well, that's a given now, but you know, at the time.
[00:57:53.359 --> 00:57:59.184]  Okay, so it seems to me that this makes a contract and they broke the contract.
[00:57:59.924 --> 00:58:05.247]  At the very least, we should no longer be required to pay into a bogus contract.
[00:58:05.447 --> 00:58:09.170]  And secondly, we should just be able to get our money back right now because they broke the contract.
[00:58:09.190 --> 00:58:27.501]  Yeah, and they know you're going to say that, so the last ten years they've been training the police that you're the enemy, giving them little Darth Vader outfits, literally, of these black riot gear with scary masks and Darth Vader armored pads and helmets designed by artists, admittedly, in a Pentagon contract for intimidation.
[00:58:28.756 --> 00:58:31.519]  Uh, and, uh, this Ringwraithian, uh, image.
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:32.420]  You know what?
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:32.901]  Stay there.
[00:58:33.001 --> 00:58:34.762]  We'll, we'll talk about Social Security.
[00:58:35.303 --> 00:58:39.247]  Look, all they're doing is dumping you out of a furnace into the Night Circle of Hades.
[00:58:39.267 --> 00:58:42.890]  And then they're gonna take your money, too, after it's in the private funds.
[00:58:43.611 --> 00:58:44.712]  That's only a small portion.
[00:58:45.573 --> 00:58:47.295]  It's just more bad for worse.
[00:58:47.675 --> 00:58:48.316]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:57.749 --> 00:58:58.390]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.050 --> 00:59:00.131]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.831 --> 00:59:01.932]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.573 --> 00:59:03.433]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.174 --> 00:59:05.675]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.735 --> 00:59:09.638]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.918 --> 00:59:14.042]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.624 --> 00:59:19.786]  Alright, we're into hour number two.
[00:59:20.126 --> 00:59:23.409]  We're going to continue your calls for those who have been holding patiently.
[00:59:24.189 --> 00:59:28.232]  Then we're going to get into what's really happening with this National ID Card Expansion legislation.
[00:59:30.033 --> 00:59:32.635]  Fake interrogations at Guantanamo for witnesses.
[00:59:33.916 --> 00:59:34.816]  This whole stage.
[00:59:34.957 --> 00:59:35.397]  Reuters.
[00:59:35.517 --> 00:59:41.041]  Iraqi doctors warn of increasing deformities in newborn babies that already tripled after the first Gulf War.
[00:59:41.101 --> 00:59:43.903]  Not just in our troops, but in the Iraqis as well.
[00:59:43.983 --> 00:59:45.444]  That's Fed's own numbers.
[00:59:46.384 --> 00:59:47.805]  WHO's own numbers as well.
[00:59:48.266 --> 00:59:51.248]  Sperm has been damaged by pollution study finds.
[00:59:51.883 --> 00:59:52.964]  We're in really bad shape.
[00:59:52.984 --> 00:59:54.585]  Worldwide cancer rates have doubled.
[00:59:55.545 --> 01:00:00.148]  And a bunch of news on the Feds coming out with their own national toll roads on the highways.
[01:00:00.968 --> 01:00:02.429]  This out of the Boston Globe.
[01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:05.031]  There is a lot of news coming up.
[01:00:05.071 --> 01:00:06.431]  But let's just continue with your calls.
[01:00:06.852 --> 01:00:09.193]  We're talking to Cherise in upstate New York.
[01:00:10.494 --> 01:00:19.019]  She wanted to comment on Bush's crumbling diatribe, hour-plus diatribe last night during sweeps.
[01:00:21.963 --> 01:00:25.084]  Telling you how wonderful his social security reform is going to be.
[01:00:25.864 --> 01:00:26.684]  And you're right, Sharice.
[01:00:26.704 --> 01:00:28.965]  They told you never to be used for a personal ID number.
[01:00:28.985 --> 01:00:31.465]  Now they're trying to force it on you as birth as that.
[01:00:31.485 --> 01:00:34.346]  And they promised it was in your own little account with your name.
[01:00:34.766 --> 01:00:35.526]  Total lie!
[01:00:35.546 --> 01:00:39.587]  See, Wall Street is now becoming the government.
[01:00:41.228 --> 01:00:42.448]  It's not privatization.
[01:00:42.468 --> 01:00:43.628]  They're just becoming the government.
[01:00:43.648 --> 01:00:44.828]  Their own little private armies.
[01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:49.670]  And it's only going to be a moderate portion of the money invested in private accounts.
[01:00:52.685 --> 01:01:00.910]  Really, it is a desperate attempt just to keep something solvent, but in the end, they're going to take it all.
[01:01:01.450 --> 01:01:02.050]  But go ahead.
[01:01:02.330 --> 01:01:12.836]  Alex, what would happen, for example, if I was to go to the Social Security office tomorrow and say I want out of the system, I will sign anything that says when it's time for me to retire.
[01:01:13.317 --> 01:01:14.958]  I don't want, you know, your money.
[01:01:15.118 --> 01:01:17.399]  I agree that I'm responsible for my own
[01:01:19.716 --> 01:01:23.102]  Well, people have been doing that, and you're right, they broke the contract, they stole the money.
[01:01:23.122 --> 01:01:26.068]  It was a contract we never asked for, they just did it to us back in 1936.
[01:01:26.148 --> 01:01:26.889]  So people have been doing that?
[01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:34.452]  Well, people stopped paying the Social Security tax.
[01:01:35.212 --> 01:01:40.475]  And the 16th Amendment was never properly ratified to give you the income tax.
[01:01:40.535 --> 01:01:41.876]  It was criminal to begin with.
[01:01:42.356 --> 01:01:44.237]  And in some cases, they will come and arrest you.
[01:01:44.297 --> 01:01:46.958]  So, this is an offer you can't refuse.
[01:01:47.178 --> 01:01:47.779]  I see.
[01:01:47.999 --> 01:01:49.219]  I mean, according to them.
[01:01:49.419 --> 01:01:50.480]  They're thugs, ma'am.
[01:01:51.385 --> 01:01:58.110]  Okay, so if a lot of people got together and tried to sue them or something, is that possible?
[01:01:58.571 --> 01:01:59.411]  That's a good idea.
[01:01:59.431 --> 01:02:03.134]  It would draw attention to the fact that they've broken their contract and are cheating you.
[01:02:03.575 --> 01:02:06.177]  But it's a contract you never asked to be in from the beginning.
[01:02:06.457 --> 01:02:06.797]  Right.
[01:02:07.097 --> 01:02:13.262]  I mean, did you know that if you took the amount of money you pay every two weeks on your paycheck... I'm self-employed.
[01:02:13.282 --> 01:02:14.423]  I get it worse than that.
[01:02:14.643 --> 01:02:15.604]  Okay, so you're paying, what, 14%?
[01:02:15.684 --> 01:02:15.884]  Right.
[01:02:17.558 --> 01:02:19.179]  Okay, on top of your other taxes.
[01:02:19.379 --> 01:02:19.720]  Right.
[01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:21.221]  You're in bad shape.
[01:02:22.221 --> 01:02:37.072]  And if you would have taken that money and invested it in a, what, 3-4% guaranteed investment, even if you were only making $40,000-$50,000 a year, the amount of taxes you would be paying, if you did that for 30 years, when you retired, you'd be a multi-millionaire.
[01:02:37.733 --> 01:02:39.194]  As it is, you're going to get a pittance.
[01:02:39.694 --> 01:02:40.054]  Yeah.
[01:02:40.075 --> 01:02:41.135]  It's true.
[01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:41.776]  It's true.
[01:02:42.076 --> 01:02:43.197]  But, oh, it's a great deal!
[01:02:43.237 --> 01:02:44.018]  The government said so.
[01:02:44.058 --> 01:02:44.679]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:45.359 --> 01:02:45.800]  Yeah.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:46.720]  Thank you.
[01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:47.441]  Appreciate it.
[01:02:47.461 --> 01:02:48.622]  I mean, just trust the government.
[01:02:48.642 --> 01:02:49.183]  Don't believe me.
[01:02:49.243 --> 01:02:49.463]  Okay?
[01:02:49.483 --> 01:02:49.903]  They're good.
[01:02:49.983 --> 01:02:50.264]  All right?
[01:02:50.904 --> 01:02:51.645]  Just submit to them.
[01:02:51.705 --> 01:02:52.005]  All right?
[01:02:52.746 --> 01:02:55.008]  And Bush goes, well, that's what I'm doing now.
[01:02:55.528 --> 01:02:56.529]  I'm offering you that.
[01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:56.930]  No, they're not.
[01:02:56.970 --> 01:03:04.897]  They're talking about taking five, six, seven percent, letting you put it in some private account that they tell you what, you know, four or five choices you got.
[01:03:06.445 --> 01:03:12.709]  And then that'll end up being your main retirement, and then they'll steal the other, you know, 90-something percent you're paying into the government.
[01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:15.371]  I mean, really, that's where this is coming from.
[01:03:16.412 --> 01:03:17.072]  It's a joke.
[01:03:17.633 --> 01:03:18.533]  It's such a joke.
[01:03:18.974 --> 01:03:20.475]  Plus, there's inflation, see?
[01:03:21.355 --> 01:03:24.577]  That's why your oil prices are double what they were a year ago.
[01:03:25.478 --> 01:03:28.020]  That's why all this is happening.
[01:03:29.421 --> 01:03:30.862]  That's why all this is developing.
[01:03:32.002 --> 01:03:33.143]  Because they're scamming you.
[01:03:33.904 --> 01:03:34.744]  They're criminals.
[01:03:34.804 --> 01:03:35.685]  They laugh at you.
[01:03:36.582 --> 01:03:40.026]  How you love them, how you follow them, how you believe them.
[01:03:41.367 --> 01:03:42.848]  Folks, they're a bunch of scum!
[01:03:43.429 --> 01:03:48.194]  Alright, we'll come back and take more of your calls quickly on the other side.
[01:03:53.374 --> 01:03:54.876]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.056 --> 01:03:58.140]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.

[01:04:02.224 --> 01:04:06.449]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.809 --> 01:04:10.594]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.674 --> 01:04:12.516]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:16.017]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.057 --> 01:04:20.778]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.918 --> 01:04:23.979]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.159 --> 01:04:27.000]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:33.622]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.

[01:06:43.975 --> 01:06:44.035]  800-509-3201.
[01:06:44.055 --> 01:06:44.095]  800-509-3201.
[01:06:44.135 --> 01:06:45.336]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:45.356 --> 01:06:46.976]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.115 --> 01:07:07.496]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:07.516 --> 01:07:11.640]  We're now 8 minutes, 15 seconds into this second hour, second segment.
[01:07:13.422 --> 01:07:23.391]  Coming up in the next hour, we're going to have Paul Joseph Watson on because he saw a new Doctor Who episode in England.
[01:07:23.411 --> 01:07:31.398]  He actually had his attention drawn to it, went online and watched it, where basically the government's carrying out terror attacks
[01:07:32.483 --> 01:07:36.207]  To blame it on its enemies as a pretext for war.
[01:07:37.088 --> 01:07:42.034]  And they use probably five, six different parallels that are identical to 9-11.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:56.588]  And I wanted to go back and play the Lone Gunman clip that was aired months and months, I don't know, five, six months before 9-11, where the government hijacks a jet to fly it into the World Trade Center for martial law to blame it on enemies in Afghanistan.
[01:07:57.229 --> 01:07:57.589]  Oh, yes!
[01:07:58.169 --> 01:08:05.234]  I wanted to play the Long Kiss Goodnight from the mid-90s with Samuel L. Jackson, where the CIA is going to blow up the World Trade Center.
[01:08:05.854 --> 01:08:09.857]  And they say, we bombed it in 93, but we're going to bomb it again to get funding.
[01:08:11.508 --> 01:08:13.189]  Which they really did vomit in 93.
[01:08:13.949 --> 01:08:15.810]  I mean, this is amazing what they do.
[01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:17.670]  How they flaunt it.
[01:08:17.690 --> 01:08:22.892]  You know, they have movies like Skulls, about skull and bones, and then whitewash what they really do there.
[01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:24.453]  Cut out all the Satanism.
[01:08:25.693 --> 01:08:26.934]  There's hundreds of examples.
[01:08:26.974 --> 01:08:30.275]  I mean, there's Teddy Bear's Picnic, made by Harry Shearer.
[01:08:30.355 --> 01:08:34.777]  You know, the guy that does Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show and all that.
[01:08:36.129 --> 01:08:40.130]  This guy made a movie, Teddy Bear's Picnic, that makes fun of me.
[01:08:40.270 --> 01:08:53.953]  There's a Hollywood movie, a feature picture production, major feature film, where I'm some idiot redneck, breaking in and going, look, they're worshipping a big stork!
[01:08:54.393 --> 01:08:55.413]  We're evil!
[01:08:56.113 --> 01:08:58.734]  And, you know, the Bohemian Grove guys are good.
[01:08:58.774 --> 01:09:02.815]  I mean, there's a couple other movies that attack me.
[01:09:05.329 --> 01:09:06.069]  I get tired of it.
[01:09:06.089 --> 01:09:07.329]  I've never even really talked about that.
[01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:09.030]  I ought to make a film about that.
[01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:13.450]  It was that show, Militia, where it's the talk show host in Texas.
[01:09:14.711 --> 01:09:16.671]  And it goes on and on.
[01:09:16.891 --> 01:09:18.191]  It's pretty funny, actually.
[01:09:19.231 --> 01:09:21.872]  Man, I tell you, these guys have got their eyes on me.
[01:09:21.932 --> 01:09:22.752]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:09:23.632 --> 01:09:25.313]  I am really blessed that I'm still here.
[01:09:25.393 --> 01:09:26.973]  I'm only alive because of the grace of God.
[01:09:27.973 --> 01:09:29.673]  And you do need to pray for me.
[01:09:31.654 --> 01:09:33.654]  But, you know what?
[01:09:34.776 --> 01:09:36.157]  It's safer to fight these people.
[01:09:36.237 --> 01:09:37.518]  It's safer to stand up against them.
[01:09:38.418 --> 01:09:43.081]  And I love my family, and I know their only hope, humanity's only hope, is to fight these people.
[01:09:43.881 --> 01:09:46.783]  And so, it's what we have to do as men.
[01:09:48.264 --> 01:09:54.127]  There's so many good women out there fighting the New World Order, but it's... men need to be men out there.
[01:09:54.368 --> 01:09:56.429]  Alright, I'm gonna... I'm diatribing again.
[01:09:57.029 --> 01:09:58.210]  I'm diatribing again.
[01:09:59.090 --> 01:10:00.231]  Let's hurry through your calls.
[01:10:00.251 --> 01:10:01.672]  I'm giving each caller a minute, because this is...
[01:10:02.321 --> 01:10:03.262]  We've got too many people holding.
[01:10:03.602 --> 01:10:05.203]  Chris in Illinois, go ahead.
[01:10:05.443 --> 01:10:15.928]  Hi Alex, I live in Moline, Illinois and there's a large Mexican population here and I shop at a local grocery store, a Mexican grocery store.
[01:10:16.208 --> 01:10:17.809]  It's just one block from my house.
[01:10:18.049 --> 01:10:22.031]  None of them in there speak, you know, English as their first language.
[01:10:22.091 --> 01:10:26.694]  So I went in there today and I asked them, I said, have you heard of an organization called META?
[01:10:27.842 --> 01:10:32.865]  And I asked the girl who was working the counter, and she said, she started freaking out.
[01:10:33.245 --> 01:10:34.906]  She started going, Matcha!
[01:10:35.526 --> 01:10:36.167]  Matcha!
[01:10:36.287 --> 01:10:41.410]  Like at the top of her lungs, and people in the back room started coming out and looking at me.
[01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:44.051]  And um, and I said, La Raza?
[01:10:44.691 --> 01:10:47.053]  You know, she was acting like she couldn't understand me.
[01:10:47.993 --> 01:10:50.795]  And um, and then, like,
[01:10:51.363 --> 01:10:58.346]  Somebody walked up to me and said, hey buddy, if you want to find out about that, I'm sure you can look it up on the internet.
[01:10:59.286 --> 01:11:03.268]  And I was kind of like, well you better believe I'm going to.
[01:11:03.288 --> 01:11:06.329]  So they were acting pretty guilty.
[01:11:06.890 --> 01:11:09.811]  Yeah, that's the impression I got from them.
[01:11:11.672 --> 01:11:12.712]  They kind of get in your face?
[01:11:13.592 --> 01:11:14.293]  Um, yeah.
[01:11:15.133 --> 01:11:16.133]  Don't spend your money there.
[01:11:16.594 --> 01:11:17.434]  Don't ever go there again.
[01:11:18.487 --> 01:11:19.849]  Is that what you'd say?
[01:11:19.929 --> 01:11:20.189]  Really?
[01:11:20.309 --> 01:11:21.210]  I'd let him know that, yeah.
[01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:24.772]  Well, I wouldn't go spend money at a Ku Klux Klan grocery store.
[01:11:24.793 --> 01:11:25.513]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:11:26.074 --> 01:11:26.554]  That's true.
[01:11:27.995 --> 01:11:30.217]  Well, I mean, folks, I want to explain this.
[01:11:30.737 --> 01:11:32.058]  I've protested the Klan.
[01:11:32.078 --> 01:11:35.021]  I have spoken out against black racists.
[01:11:36.016 --> 01:11:41.558]  And uh, but, but, but Mecha, and we gave you there, you know, everything for the race, for everyone else, nothing.
[01:11:41.979 --> 01:11:43.199]  La Raza means the race.
[01:11:43.719 --> 01:11:51.262]  We got radio stations here locally, one's called The Invasion, and my wife speaks fluent Spanish, and you can tune into it, and it's like, THE INVASION IS HAPPENING NOW!
[01:11:51.462 --> 01:11:52.143]  WE ARE TAKING OVER!
[01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:52.683]  HA HA HA!
[01:11:52.883 --> 01:11:56.965]  You know, that's like the tagline for the station, and uh, it's like HA HA HA HA HA!
[01:11:57.125 --> 01:11:57.525]  HA HA HA HA!
[01:11:57.845 --> 01:12:06.887]  And I mean, you know, here I am just living my life, friendly and happy, and I got a lot of Hispanic friends, and you know, they're Americans, and they told me, yeah, stuff's kind of going on.
[01:12:06.947 --> 01:12:08.788]  I've been told, why aren't I part of the revolution?
[01:12:09.148 --> 01:12:11.048]  And it's all funded out of New York and D.C.
[01:12:12.108 --> 01:12:12.929]  Bush is all for it.
[01:12:12.949 --> 01:12:14.109]  They want to break the country up.
[01:12:14.169 --> 01:12:16.009]  It's some stupid pride issue.
[01:12:16.770 --> 01:12:20.951]  And I mean, it has to be responded to.
[01:12:20.971 --> 01:12:22.531]  They're doing it in secret.
[01:12:23.928 --> 01:12:25.948]  Well, they weren't three years ago.
[01:12:26.048 --> 01:12:28.129]  Now it's being exposed, so they're all freaked out.
[01:12:28.149 --> 01:12:31.450]  I mean, look, there's a big statue in East Austin.
[01:12:31.470 --> 01:12:34.470]  It's like a big stone-hinged pipe doorway.
[01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:36.711]  It's actually very well done.
[01:12:36.731 --> 01:12:39.051]  And it's got the Aztecs taking over Texas.
[01:12:40.111 --> 01:12:47.413]  And they've got... I mean, they've got video of the rallies with pictures of white people's heads cut off, and they're saying, all whites will be murdered.
[01:12:48.293 --> 01:12:50.514]  Folks, I'm not... I've got it on TV.
[01:12:50.534 --> 01:12:52.374]  I've got to put that on the web for people that haven't seen it.
[01:12:52.998 --> 01:12:55.260]  People's heads chopped off, blood everywhere.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.603]  I mean, pictures of a blonde-haired blue-eyed with their heads cut off.
[01:12:57.723 --> 01:12:59.805]  Our government is trying to perfect genocide.
[01:13:00.926 --> 01:13:01.627]  Well, they really are.
[01:13:01.647 --> 01:13:03.989]  But, I mean, look, it's perfect Balkanization.
[01:13:04.389 --> 01:13:05.090]  Thanks for the call.
[01:13:05.811 --> 01:13:06.892]  The Nazis would do this.
[01:13:06.932 --> 01:13:12.397]  When they went into Africa, they'd play one tribe off against another, one Arab tribe off against another.
[01:13:12.877 --> 01:13:13.658]  The British do it.
[01:13:13.678 --> 01:13:16.441]  Northern Ireland, Protestant against Catholic, Catholic against Protestant.
[01:13:17.214 --> 01:13:18.595]  They do in the U.N.
[01:13:18.635 --> 01:13:19.155]  and Africa.
[01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:21.036]  We'll play the Tootsies off against the Hootos.
[01:13:21.056 --> 01:13:22.877]  The Hootos off against the Tootsies.
[01:13:24.518 --> 01:13:25.519]  In Africa, that's how it is.
[01:13:25.559 --> 01:13:28.680]  Everybody's black, but they'll play one tribe off against each other.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:30.121]  Well, they're on the other side of the river.
[01:13:31.182 --> 01:13:37.045]  It's like that Star Trek episode where one guy's left side is black and the right side is white.
[01:13:37.425 --> 01:13:39.706]  The other guy, the left side is white and the right side is black.
[01:13:39.766 --> 01:13:41.567]  Ever seen that old episode?
[01:13:41.607 --> 01:13:42.848]  The one group's the elite group.
[01:13:43.439 --> 01:13:59.489]  There's a Dr. Seuss children's book, you know, with the birds, with one green spot, and then the guy comes to town that shows them how to put two green spots on for the group that doesn't have spots, and then the other group goes and gets three spots, and, you know, they're all trying to... It's very primitive, it feels very good.
[01:14:00.330 --> 01:14:02.731]  Hitler did it, you know, with his German peasantry.
[01:14:02.991 --> 01:14:04.392]  They were just farmers in Germany.
[01:14:04.873 --> 01:14:08.535]  And the Mexicans, you know, were peasants, predominantly, poor third world population.
[01:14:09.187 --> 01:14:14.191]  And they're good, hard-working people, but they fill them full of this racial pride.
[01:14:15.051 --> 01:14:19.294]  And then they tell everybody else, don't have your own racial pride, just this group can.
[01:14:19.895 --> 01:14:22.717]  And then they go around doing this, and then they think it's normal.
[01:14:22.737 --> 01:14:23.778]  They think it's okay.
[01:14:24.158 --> 01:14:26.600]  They think it's okay to say, this is Mexico.
[01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:29.922]  Look, I've been to Mexico 30 times.
[01:14:30.102 --> 01:14:30.983]  I don't want to live there.
[01:14:31.863 --> 01:14:36.307]  Okay, it's very corrupt, and we're getting very corrupt too, and I'm not saying our government's perfect.
[01:14:36.347 --> 01:14:38.048]  But our government is behind what you're doing.
[01:14:39.065 --> 01:14:39.705]  Thanks for the call.
[01:14:40.625 --> 01:14:44.666]  And, uh, yeah, it's, uh, so that's what they do.
[01:14:46.206 --> 01:14:46.946]  I've run into it.
[01:14:46.986 --> 01:14:49.167]  Look, I've got friends and family that speak Spanish.
[01:14:49.207 --> 01:14:50.707]  My cousin grew up in Guatemala.
[01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:54.908]  In fact, when he dreams, you know, I've been on trips with him before, and he's asleep.
[01:14:54.948 --> 01:14:56.308]  He's, you know, speaking in Spanish.
[01:14:56.908 --> 01:15:01.029]  He grew up until he was, you know, a little kid in, uh, in, uh, Guatemala.
[01:15:01.589 --> 01:15:06.750]  So he speaks Spanish, and he's told me, uh, being a bartender, that, uh, he also DJs.
[01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.790]  He said that
[01:15:08.479 --> 01:15:08.759]  You know?
[01:15:10.601 --> 01:15:17.526]  Hispanics bumped into the thing and they'll be saying horrible things about him being a white guy in Spanish while he's sitting there getting the drinks and he'll just snap back at them.
[01:15:18.506 --> 01:15:20.508]  Uh, you know, hey what's your problem?
[01:15:21.028 --> 01:15:22.089]  No, I'll apologize.
[01:15:23.010 --> 01:15:25.291]  I've been in restaurants with my wife and heard little comments.
[01:15:25.732 --> 01:15:27.033]  Uh, you know, I don't appreciate it!
[01:15:27.593 --> 01:15:28.093]  Okay?
[01:15:29.535 --> 01:15:33.818]  Now I don't dislike you because you, uh, you, uh, have got some brown in your skin.
[01:15:33.878 --> 01:15:34.538]  I don't care!
[01:15:35.219 --> 01:15:36.560]  But you got a problem with me
[01:15:37.555 --> 01:15:43.998]  And you're putting out flyers and publications with M16s on the fronts and images of people's heads cut off, saying you're going to kill me.
[01:15:44.438 --> 01:15:45.939]  Well, let's go!
[01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:48.700]  I mean, let's go!
[01:15:50.701 --> 01:15:51.722]  You want it, you're going to get it.
[01:15:53.342 --> 01:15:54.143]  It's just that simple.
[01:15:54.203 --> 01:15:58.144]  I mean, does it matter that the Texas Constitution was written by a Hispanic?
[01:15:58.825 --> 01:16:03.027]  Does it matter that 30% of the people that fought for Texas independence were Hispanic?
[01:16:04.227 --> 01:16:05.088]  Does that matter to you?
[01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:05.748]  No, it doesn't.
[01:16:06.488 --> 01:16:15.313]  Does it matter that your own Mexican people, uh, threw out Santa Ana, but you still say he's great today, and overthrew him as a dictator?
[01:16:16.354 --> 01:16:17.414]  I mean, does that matter?
[01:16:17.434 --> 01:16:21.116]  I mean, sure, were some people somewhere back in the past mean to Mexicans?
[01:16:21.156 --> 01:16:22.217]  Are there racist white people?
[01:16:22.657 --> 01:16:23.278]  There's some.
[01:16:23.718 --> 01:16:24.118]  Not really.
[01:16:24.178 --> 01:16:26.399]  Most of us are these guilt-ridden, pathetic creatures.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.181]  Well, I'm not anymore, and I'm not putting up with it.
[01:16:30.101 --> 01:16:30.922]  Do you understand me?
[01:16:32.563 --> 01:16:33.643]  I'm not putting up with it.
[01:16:33.663 --> 01:16:34.364]  Do you understand?
[01:16:35.264 --> 01:16:36.165]  I'm not your slave.
[01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:46.419]  And it's like I told Vicente Fox, your master, your non-Hispanic master, I am not your slave and I will never be your slave.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:52.024]  And you're all puffed up with that, we're taking over, ha ha ha.
[01:16:52.985 --> 01:16:58.310]  I don't care how many Hispanics are here as long as they love freedom and the Second Amendment and national sovereignty, but that's not happening.
[01:16:59.153 --> 01:17:05.136]  These illegal aliens, and the liberal groups that control them, and the Bush that supports them, want to shut this country down.
[01:17:05.616 --> 01:17:06.997]  And it's all part of a larger plan.
[01:17:12.339 --> 01:17:15.381]  I said I want to take a lot of calls, but the caller raises such important points.
[01:17:16.361 --> 01:17:18.282]  The caller brings up such important points.
[01:17:19.723 --> 01:17:22.304]  It's just that simple.
[01:17:22.864 --> 01:17:24.725]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[01:17:27.375 --> 01:17:29.476]  Ken in New York and Ron in New York and others.
[01:17:29.496 --> 01:17:30.136]  Go ahead, Ken.
[01:17:30.896 --> 01:17:31.717]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:17:32.017 --> 01:17:34.938]  It was great listening to you and Terry Anderson yesterday.
[01:17:34.998 --> 01:17:47.402]  I think if we had 50 men like Terry Anderson in Congress, we would really deal with the Larry Conquista problem immediately, but we just got to hope and pray for men like him and you to get into government.
[01:17:47.602 --> 01:17:48.623]  Well, you heard Jerry.
[01:17:48.643 --> 01:17:50.463]  I mean, he woke up 12 years ago.
[01:17:50.483 --> 01:17:53.164]  His people kept, everywhere he went, calling him the N-word.
[01:17:53.224 --> 01:17:53.424]  Right.
[01:17:53.765 --> 01:17:54.565]  Telling him, get out!
[01:17:55.876 --> 01:17:56.677]  That's what he said.
[01:17:56.697 --> 01:17:57.417]  Get out, nigger!
[01:17:57.878 --> 01:17:58.738]  Get out of here, nigger!
[01:17:59.559 --> 01:18:02.321]  On that topic... That's offensive, I'm sorry folks.
[01:18:02.341 --> 01:18:03.482]  That's what Terry said yesterday.
[01:18:03.502 --> 01:18:04.243]  Go ahead.
[01:18:04.323 --> 01:18:05.804]  That's reality, unfortunately.
[01:18:06.925 --> 01:18:22.819]  I heard a BBC World Service report last weekend and they interviewed a Mexican music professor at a Los Angeles college and the topic was about how mariachi music is getting more and more mainstream in the country, especially in the Southwest.
[01:18:24.935 --> 01:18:25.495]  There's the music.
[01:18:25.515 --> 01:18:26.096]  Can I hold on?
[01:18:26.196 --> 01:18:26.636]  Yeah, sure.
[01:18:26.656 --> 01:18:27.036]  All right.
[01:18:27.256 --> 01:18:27.836]  But keep going.
[01:18:28.317 --> 01:18:33.059]  So, the reporter asked him, why do you think this is happening?
[01:18:33.339 --> 01:18:35.500]  And he gave the perfect one-word answer.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:36.781]  Demographics.
[01:18:38.541 --> 01:18:40.502]  And he just elaborated on it.
[01:18:40.542 --> 01:18:44.084]  He predicted that California was going to be a mostly Latino state.
[01:18:44.864 --> 01:18:46.365]  And he didn't stop with California.
[01:18:46.385 --> 01:18:49.487]  He then said it's also going to happen to Arizona and Texas.
[01:18:50.267 --> 01:18:51.307]  Yeah, and stay there.
[01:18:51.327 --> 01:18:52.508]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[01:18:54.099 --> 01:18:55.580]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:00.463]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:19:00.783 --> 01:19:03.145]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:19:03.365 --> 01:19:04.906]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:19:05.286 --> 01:19:10.369]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.

[01:19:54.425 --> 01:19:55.185]  Terrorism!
[01:19:55.285 --> 01:20:01.349]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:20:01.609 --> 01:20:03.210]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:20:03.450 --> 01:20:05.932]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:06.312 --> 01:20:20.881]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:20.921 --> 01:20:21.261]  government.

[01:20:57.457 --> 01:21:05.004]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.

[01:22:00.898 --> 01:22:02.179]  It suppresses your immune system!

[01:22:09.802 --> 01:22:12.465]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:22:12.725 --> 01:22:13.506]  Your health suffers.

[01:22:58.214 --> 01:23:03.458]  Waging war on corruption, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.919 --> 01:23:06.781]  And I've been totally clear about this.
[01:23:10.123 --> 01:23:14.607]  I don't care what group you're with, you should see yourself as an American.
[01:23:14.947 --> 01:23:16.448]  I've never said this on air, but it's true.
[01:23:16.468 --> 01:23:18.190]  I was just thinking about it during the break.
[01:23:18.770 --> 01:23:23.574]  My best friend, somebody I, when I've got some free hours,
[01:23:25.563 --> 01:23:32.907]  You know, I go play cards, or go play pool every once in a while, or go to a movie when it's time with my wife, is Hispanic.
[01:23:33.387 --> 01:23:34.648]  My best friend.
[01:23:35.028 --> 01:23:36.229]  He really is my best friend.
[01:23:36.249 --> 01:23:38.971]  The person I hang out with the most is Hispanic.
[01:23:39.531 --> 01:23:40.612]  Nobody really knows that much.
[01:23:40.632 --> 01:23:41.632]  You've seen me out around town.
[01:23:42.233 --> 01:23:43.173]  And I've talked to him about it.
[01:23:43.193 --> 01:23:44.694]  He goes, yeah, it's really true.
[01:23:44.714 --> 01:23:47.015]  I have Hispanics come over to me.
[01:23:47.876 --> 01:23:49.817]  And I mean, he's from South Texas, folks.
[01:23:51.226 --> 01:23:53.528]  Come up to me and go, why do you speak English?
[01:23:53.828 --> 01:23:54.888]  You only speak Spanish.
[01:23:55.069 --> 01:23:57.330]  To him it's kind of a joke.
[01:23:58.751 --> 01:23:59.791]  It isn't a joke to me.
[01:24:00.912 --> 01:24:10.737]  And then you've got that other kind of paradox there where the most Congressional Medal of Honor get handed out to Hispanics, very patriotic.
[01:24:11.318 --> 01:24:18.782]  I remember growing up, when I'd visit my cousin in San Antonio after my uncle and aunt moved from Guatemala, they moved to San Antonio.
[01:24:19.426 --> 01:24:22.067]  And I'd be down there, and of course my cousin and all his friends were Hispanic.
[01:24:22.567 --> 01:24:25.147]  And we'd go spend a week or two down there every summer.
[01:24:25.928 --> 01:24:27.088]  A couple summers.
[01:24:27.788 --> 01:24:31.209]  And we'd be out riding around and doing stuff and going to parties and stuff.
[01:24:31.249 --> 01:24:33.349]  And these were middle class Hispanics.
[01:24:33.549 --> 01:24:36.250]  And they were very upset about the illegal aliens.
[01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:39.151]  Saying they were driving down the wages and doing all this.
[01:24:39.171 --> 01:24:40.071]  And they were telling me about it.
[01:24:40.091 --> 01:24:42.031]  And I thought it was some kind of test or something.
[01:24:42.051 --> 01:24:44.452]  Because I wasn't even thinking about racial stuff.
[01:24:44.472 --> 01:24:47.053]  And they seemed to be real concerned about these Hispanics.
[01:24:47.133 --> 01:24:48.333]  But they really meant it.
[01:24:49.392 --> 01:24:52.115]  So, look, I don't know what's going on, folks.
[01:24:52.255 --> 01:24:52.955]  I just know this.
[01:24:54.357 --> 01:25:04.906]  When a lot of these Hispanics that are in this country now that don't see themselves as Americans, that got the Mexican flags on their cars, you know, they don't know that you can speak Spanish.
[01:25:05.947 --> 01:25:06.427]  They don't know.
[01:25:06.467 --> 01:25:09.370]  And they'll be shooting their mouths off right next to you in a restaurant.
[01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:10.651]  And I don't understand that.
[01:25:11.152 --> 01:25:12.513]  I mean, you're making enemies.
[01:25:14.915 --> 01:25:17.096]  But I'm going to briefly let this caller finish up.
[01:25:17.436 --> 01:25:19.036]  Ken in New York, then I'm going to Ron and others.
[01:25:19.056 --> 01:25:19.596]  Go ahead, Ken.
[01:25:19.616 --> 01:25:25.958]  Well, what antagonized me the most about this Mexican music professor at L.A.
[01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:33.040]  University was he was talking about La Reconquista like it's already happened or it's going to happen tomorrow.
[01:25:34.139 --> 01:25:36.800]  And he might be right, the way things are going.
[01:25:36.820 --> 01:25:39.841]  Well, Time Magazine two years ago had the cover story, Mexifornia.
[01:25:40.301 --> 01:25:40.661]  Right.
[01:25:40.681 --> 01:25:43.242]  But the thing is, it isn't just that there's a big group here.
[01:25:43.982 --> 01:25:44.542]  So what?
[01:25:44.643 --> 01:25:48.824]  It's that they're going, here's the sign of a white person's head cut off.
[01:25:48.864 --> 01:25:50.004]  We're going to kill you.
[01:25:50.084 --> 01:25:50.765]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:50.865 --> 01:25:51.145]  Thank you.
[01:25:51.305 --> 01:25:52.845]  And I'm supposed to go, oh, thank you.
[01:25:52.885 --> 01:25:53.745]  You're going to kill me.
[01:25:53.765 --> 01:25:55.446]  I want to point something else.
[01:25:56.286 --> 01:26:01.328]  There's been really a bad relationship between different races in California, predominantly.
[01:26:02.193 --> 01:26:04.596]  In Texas, it's really been similar culture.
[01:26:04.616 --> 01:26:07.238]  You know, the cowboy hats, the whole nine yards.
[01:26:07.318 --> 01:26:11.783]  And in these towns, German and Polish towns wouldn't really get along with each other.
[01:26:11.923 --> 01:26:13.564]  Or German and Czechoslovakian towns.
[01:26:13.765 --> 01:26:14.405]  There's a bunch of them.
[01:26:15.026 --> 01:26:17.889]  You know, my family came into Texas on my mom's side in the 1840s.
[01:26:19.030 --> 01:26:20.071]  They don't really get along.
[01:26:20.231 --> 01:26:22.954]  But there's always been Hispanics in all those towns.
[01:26:22.994 --> 01:26:24.936]  And they intermarry with the Poles, the Germans.
[01:26:25.336 --> 01:26:26.117]  They all get along.
[01:26:27.026 --> 01:26:28.627]  So, that's the way it used to be.
[01:26:29.547 --> 01:26:32.508]  There isn't all this hatred and all this stuff going on.
[01:26:32.548 --> 01:26:36.089]  Again, about 30% of the Founding Fathers of Texas were Hispanic.
[01:26:36.730 --> 01:26:39.971]  But boy, you don't want the La Reconquistas to hear that.
[01:26:40.011 --> 01:26:41.171]  They get really upset.
[01:26:41.611 --> 01:26:46.173]  I mean, these buffoons claim that it's the Aztecs that have the right to the Southwest.
[01:26:46.473 --> 01:26:47.614]  You were never here!
[01:26:47.694 --> 01:26:49.514]  You have no dibs on it!
[01:26:50.355 --> 01:26:56.097]  If it's anybody, it's the Comanche and the Apache and all these other groups.
[01:26:57.237 --> 01:27:20.122]  uh... from the uh... central uh... western areas out to the west coast i mean it's just all of you know about racism these these hispanics that are racist really hate indians they got all these mean names for native americans i'm sick of it and uh... we're gonna win this fight with the help of everybody let's go ahead and uh... talk to Ron in New York.
[01:27:20.162 --> 01:27:20.742]  Ron, go ahead.
[01:27:21.202 --> 01:27:25.303]  Alex, did I send you a letter a couple weeks ago with a certain date in February in it?
[01:27:25.343 --> 01:27:26.623]  I don't know if you read that letter?
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:32.062]  You had mentioned February on the radio one day, to a caller, a response to a caller.
[01:27:32.262 --> 01:27:33.203]  I think I missed your letter.
[01:27:33.263 --> 01:27:34.463]  One of my staff had read it.
[01:27:34.503 --> 01:27:38.165]  Well, anyway, did the 20th ring a bell with you in that month?
[01:27:38.985 --> 01:27:39.226]  No.
[01:27:39.586 --> 01:27:40.766]  Okay, well that's not it then.
[01:27:41.166 --> 01:27:42.007]  We'll pass on that.
[01:27:42.547 --> 01:27:49.230]  You know, your monologue, the personification of evil that you're talking about is energized.
[01:27:49.250 --> 01:27:51.451]  We know it's a moot point by Satan himself.
[01:27:53.472 --> 01:27:54.453]  To mask that evil,
[01:27:56.294 --> 01:28:04.775]  The antidote may only be God Himself to match this kind of supernatural power of, you know, Book of Revelation, Zechariah.
[01:28:04.936 --> 01:28:05.756]  Is that the time?
[01:28:05.896 --> 01:28:10.737]  And if not, if not, then we the American people have to do radical surgery.
[01:28:11.137 --> 01:28:11.817]  We know what that is.
[01:28:11.997 --> 01:28:16.417]  Well, regardless, again, duty is mine, consequences is God's.
[01:28:17.018 --> 01:28:18.498]  I have a job to fight this evil.
[01:28:19.438 --> 01:28:23.379]  I have a job to defend against it, and I know we have power over it when we take action.
[01:28:23.879 --> 01:28:24.979]  Will enough people take action?
[01:28:25.828 --> 01:28:26.288]  We'll see.
[01:28:28.188 --> 01:28:28.769]  Anything else, Ron?
[01:28:29.449 --> 01:28:30.609]  No, but, uh, well taken.
[01:28:30.629 --> 01:28:31.289]  God bless.
[01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:32.449]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:28:33.089 --> 01:28:33.850]  Yeah, I mean, look.
[01:28:34.470 --> 01:28:38.591]  If I see five thugs attacking an old lady and I have no chance of winning, I'm not gonna think.
[01:28:38.671 --> 01:28:39.591]  I'm gonna attack them.
[01:28:40.451 --> 01:28:41.211]  It's unconscious.
[01:28:43.892 --> 01:28:44.792]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.272 --> 01:28:46.912]  The Empire's on the run.

[01:30:55.602 --> 01:30:59.443]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:30:59.764 --> 01:31:00.584]  Read the labels.
[01:31:01.004 --> 01:31:05.145]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:05.366 --> 01:31:09.547]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[01:31:58.954 --> 01:32:02.475]  The globalist social architects know that we're all tribal.
[01:32:03.955 --> 01:32:05.716]  They know we're all very primitive at heart.
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:12.363]  They know the instinct to be part of a group and to identify with that group is overwhelming.
[01:32:13.524 --> 01:32:21.210]  And so, they use multiculturalism as a tool to actually divide, not to bring people together.
[01:32:23.151 --> 01:32:28.495]  And in the name of fighting, quote, racism, which I don't even believe exists, truly tribalism,
[01:32:29.355 --> 01:32:32.336]  Because you'd have German tribes fighting with each other 2,000 years ago.
[01:32:32.376 --> 01:32:37.457]  You'd have, you know, native tribes in Mexico fighting with each other 1,000 years ago.
[01:32:38.037 --> 01:32:39.537]  It's always this group against that group.
[01:32:39.877 --> 01:32:41.417]  They'll come up with any configuration to do it.
[01:32:41.717 --> 01:32:42.738]  And the globalists do this.
[01:32:42.758 --> 01:32:43.458]  They play us.
[01:32:44.338 --> 01:32:50.939]  The Chinese Communist government plays off different regions against each other and different farming groups against each other.
[01:32:50.979 --> 01:32:51.920]  It's the same thing.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.180]  Stop playing along with it!
[01:32:56.178 --> 01:32:57.779]  Stop going along with it.
[01:32:57.819 --> 01:33:02.582]  I remember I was in an art class, honors art class, in high school, so I was pretty good at it.
[01:33:03.302 --> 01:33:08.946]  And I finished up all my credits my senior year, so I basically was in this waste time class here in Austin.
[01:33:10.147 --> 01:33:18.011]  And we went on a field trip to UT, and there was this top Latino artist, it was all political, demonizing America.
[01:33:18.332 --> 01:33:21.794]  How bad America is, how evil it is, how it stole the land.
[01:33:23.014 --> 01:33:24.315]  That's when I first started arguing with him.
[01:33:26.775 --> 01:33:33.117]  Because I knew something about history and he was all shocked and met and was talking with the teacher and she was saying, well he's... and then... but you know what?
[01:33:33.137 --> 01:33:34.597]  They're actually very respectful.
[01:33:35.177 --> 01:33:39.658]  By the way, the globalists and their minions don't respect you when you grovel and lick their boots.
[01:33:40.038 --> 01:33:41.279]  People respect strength.
[01:33:42.519 --> 01:33:42.919]  Okay?
[01:33:43.519 --> 01:33:45.840]  And this stuff needs to be stood up to.
[01:33:45.900 --> 01:33:47.380]  This is only one part of it though.
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:55.002]  Again, the Hispanics are going to be dwarfed by the Asians in the next wave.
[01:33:56.253 --> 01:34:03.938]  Uh, the Asian situation isn't as bad though, because, uh, they, uh, are involved in some La Rican fiesta.
[01:34:04.859 --> 01:34:07.480]  Uh, but there's still problems, it'll drive the wages down.
[01:34:07.981 --> 01:34:11.403]  I mean, it's a six billion plus people, folks, they want to come here!
[01:34:12.343 --> 01:34:13.924]  I mean, have you been to a third world country?
[01:34:13.984 --> 01:34:14.825]  It's not pretty!
[01:34:15.285 --> 01:34:17.647]  It's going to be like that here, it's going to hurt all of us!
[01:34:18.504 --> 01:34:22.845]  Get past your emotion, get past your programming, and realize this.
[01:34:23.325 --> 01:34:29.586]  I've got a bunch of other news and calls here, but we've been spending a lot of time on this issue because it's really starting to crest here.
[01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:35.908]  We've got the initiative now when minions like Schwarzenegger are now agreeing with us.
[01:34:35.968 --> 01:34:37.948]  And again, that's only in words, not in actions.
[01:34:38.928 --> 01:34:39.928]  Let's go ahead.
[01:34:40.768 --> 01:34:41.849]  He's always been for open borders.
[01:34:43.069 --> 01:34:45.189]  He goes with whatever he thinks is popular.
[01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:48.250]  It's been an illusion that open borders is popular.
[01:34:50.397 --> 01:34:55.101]  67% of Hispanics are against it, but they're being bullied into going along with it like everybody else.
[01:34:55.582 --> 01:34:58.204]  The second Ron in New York, another Ron in New York, go ahead.
[01:34:58.745 --> 01:35:00.306]  Hello Alex, excuse me.
[01:35:01.887 --> 01:35:02.328]  How you doing?
[01:35:02.508 --> 01:35:05.170]  Okay, I'm sorry, excuse me, I had a glitch in my throat.
[01:35:05.871 --> 01:35:17.681]  With reference to what you were saying, and we were talking about the REAL ID Act yesterday, and I was speaking with your guest, he really should check the versions that have since come forth, the carnations of that bill, incarnations,
[01:35:18.385 --> 01:35:25.071]  Since December, when it originally was introduced, that bill has been modified and watered down to such a degree.
[01:35:25.671 --> 01:35:35.460]  The key provision in it, which is a lawful presence requirement that someone would have to establish to have a lawful presence... You get a lawful presence with a consular matricula that the country issues?
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:38.923]  That has been removed from this Real ID bill.
[01:35:39.263 --> 01:35:39.564]  Alright?
[01:35:39.584 --> 01:35:42.266]  So that's like the plug in a tub full of water.
[01:35:42.306 --> 01:35:43.387]  That's the salient point.
[01:35:43.507 --> 01:35:45.449]  Pull that out and everything else doesn't matter.
[01:35:46.337 --> 01:35:53.419]  In addition to it, if he looks at the fine print of the bill, he will find that there are now provisions in it to try and legitimize the illegitimate.
[01:35:53.979 --> 01:35:57.180]  To try and legitimize the presence of illegal aliens in the country.
[01:35:57.640 --> 01:36:02.461]  The way that they're trying to deal with it, and they're doing it in a very cunning way, a very Orwellian way.
[01:36:02.481 --> 01:36:05.902]  Well, they have the left attacking it, saying it's going to hurt immigrants, but it does the opposite.
[01:36:05.922 --> 01:36:08.103]  Conservatives see that and dial on for it.
[01:36:08.243 --> 01:36:10.204]  Okay, that's exactly what I was about to say.
[01:36:10.264 --> 01:36:11.485]  You took the thought out of my head.
[01:36:11.925 --> 01:36:23.651]  They'll have some liberals attack the bill for all the wrong reasons, and the knee-jerk reaction by the good ol' boy right will then automatically be to go to the defense of the bill, when the bill is not in the interest of anybody.
[01:36:23.691 --> 01:36:25.812]  That's the psychology that they're playing.
[01:36:26.932 --> 01:36:33.596]  We're playing, but the neocons you're talking about, the minions, they're playing checkers and the globalists are playing chess.
[01:36:34.321 --> 01:36:34.861]  That's correct.
[01:36:35.022 --> 01:36:35.482]  That's right.
[01:36:35.722 --> 01:36:36.122]  That's right.
[01:36:36.142 --> 01:36:38.024]  They're very sophisticated at what they're doing.
[01:36:38.504 --> 01:36:41.367]  Now, you had mentioned the issue, the situation in Texas.
[01:36:42.087 --> 01:36:45.170]  My wife is of Mexican ancestry.
[01:36:45.210 --> 01:36:47.111]  She's, I guess, what you folks call Tejano.
[01:36:47.692 --> 01:36:49.973]  Her family has been in the San Antonio area since the 1600s.
[01:36:53.809 --> 01:37:00.375]  Now, people do have to understand that the presence of Mexicans in the area known as Texas today was sparse to nothing.
[01:37:00.896 --> 01:37:07.963]  And those people that lived there despised the central government in Mexico City, Santa Ana.
[01:37:08.183 --> 01:37:10.205]  These people felt criminally neglected.
[01:37:10.285 --> 01:37:14.029]  Do you know her ancestors fought with the Texans against Santa Ana?
[01:37:14.309 --> 01:37:15.030]  Thirty percent.
[01:37:15.310 --> 01:37:17.213]  I know, but they lie in the history books.
[01:37:17.253 --> 01:37:17.914]  They twist it.
[01:37:18.255 --> 01:37:21.660]  And further, the other percent didn't fight for Mexico.
[01:37:21.700 --> 01:37:22.521]  They just stayed out of it.
[01:37:22.561 --> 01:37:25.625]  They couldn't care less they despised Santana that much.
[01:37:25.886 --> 01:37:27.548]  Well, they threw him out in Mexico.
[01:37:29.771 --> 01:37:37.636]  So, I don't know where we get confabulated history, and people... So listen, the Aztecs were the Nazis of Mexico today.
[01:37:37.896 --> 01:37:41.038]  They ran around killing the other tribes, murdering, slaughtering.
[01:37:41.238 --> 01:37:45.761]  They would grab an entire tribe of 10,000 people and sacrifice them in two days.
[01:37:46.021 --> 01:37:47.882]  I mean, I've been there, it's admitted.
[01:37:48.203 --> 01:37:58.511]  And then the New World Order picked this as the liberation theology to create the legend, to create the fable, and now this is the standard.
[01:37:58.931 --> 01:38:00.272]  Again, it's like the cult of death.
[01:38:00.372 --> 01:38:02.634]  Bush is into Skull and Bones, the Aztecs are into it.
[01:38:02.974 --> 01:38:04.015]  This is what they picked.
[01:38:04.971 --> 01:38:10.476]  Let me say this, how do you think the Conquistadors were able to conquer the Aztecs with the help of other local tribes?
[01:38:10.837 --> 01:38:12.278]  Otherwise they never would have been able to do it.
[01:38:12.598 --> 01:38:18.063]  Yeah, you had a boatload of about 400 Conquistadors conquering 800,000 people.
[01:38:18.323 --> 01:38:23.488]  But that aside, what I call the international oligarch or power structure,
[01:38:24.088 --> 01:38:27.131]  They try to encourage this inter-tribal warfare.
[01:38:27.171 --> 01:38:28.391]  They've done it in other places.
[01:38:28.452 --> 01:38:29.332]  Now they're doing it here.
[01:38:29.452 --> 01:38:29.733]  Why?
[01:38:30.193 --> 01:38:40.241]  Because what we've known as traditional or customary America up to this point, alright, is one of the few stumbling blocks still in their way of complete world domination.
[01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:48.627]  Our tradition and our history and custom are in that way, so they've got to break this nation down from within that way by creating inter-tribal warfare.
[01:38:48.827 --> 01:38:50.829]  And another thing you should know, and I don't want to digress,
[01:38:51.369 --> 01:38:56.821]  Because yesterday Congress passed a 2.6 trillion dollar budget, alright?
[01:38:56.981 --> 01:38:58.344]  That's conservative.
[01:38:58.845 --> 01:39:00.047]  It's 600 billion better.
[01:39:00.488 --> 01:39:01.791]  But get a hold of this, Alex.
[01:39:02.463 --> 01:39:08.767]  They're starting to decrease the social entitlement programs that everyone became addicted to over the last 40 years.
[01:39:09.007 --> 01:39:10.108]  That's always been the plan.
[01:39:10.188 --> 01:39:13.109]  You get us domesticated, then you slaughter us.
[01:39:13.269 --> 01:39:14.830]  That's right, just like a dog pusher.
[01:39:15.250 --> 01:39:19.513]  I hook you on the heroin, then I withdraw it, and you come and beg me for every job.
[01:39:19.793 --> 01:39:22.655]  And as they shut the economy down and flood us with cheap labor,
[01:39:23.402 --> 01:39:35.007]  Then, the only jobs that are going to be there will be like the Great Society, or before that, you know, these make-work programs with Roosevelt, and look at the new jobs you can get at the college.
[01:39:35.267 --> 01:39:36.728]  Look at the new courses they're giving.
[01:39:36.768 --> 01:39:37.828]  It's all police state.
[01:39:37.868 --> 01:39:38.709]  It's all prisons.
[01:39:38.789 --> 01:39:40.309]  It's all jail guards.
[01:39:40.369 --> 01:39:43.111]  It's all... everything's going to shift to that place for the growth.
[01:39:43.991 --> 01:39:44.811]  No, it's true.
[01:39:45.712 --> 01:39:46.412]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:39:46.672 --> 01:39:48.773]  Let me tell Laurie Conquista something again.
[01:39:49.597 --> 01:39:52.759]  The textbooks that have taught you this were funded by the U.S.
[01:39:52.779 --> 01:39:54.540]  government in Mexico through grants.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:58.863]  The textbooks in America pushing all of this are funded by the U.S.
[01:39:58.903 --> 01:39:59.283]  government.
[01:40:00.024 --> 01:40:01.004]  Why would the U.S.
[01:40:01.064 --> 01:40:04.847]  government, why would Republican administrations and Democrats do this?
[01:40:05.167 --> 01:40:07.648]  And you say you're fighting the establishment.
[01:40:08.029 --> 01:40:09.249]  Give me a break.
[01:40:10.630 --> 01:40:11.791]  That's why you're so arrogant.
[01:40:12.071 --> 01:40:16.234]  You've got the government on your side while you run around acting like you're anti-establishment.
[01:40:16.634 --> 01:40:17.695]  It's pathetic!
[01:40:19.281 --> 01:40:21.522]  Well let me tell you, we're not cowed and intimidated anymore.
[01:40:22.162 --> 01:40:23.343]  Regardless of what color we are.
[01:40:23.643 --> 01:40:25.103]  And we're standing up against you.
[01:40:25.664 --> 01:40:26.904]  And we're going to expose you.
[01:40:27.464 --> 01:40:28.325]  And you need to know that.
[01:40:29.565 --> 01:40:34.907]  And we're going to start ensuring that the employers that hire knowingly all these illegals, we're going to make sure they get arrested.
[01:40:35.928 --> 01:40:37.268]  And we're going to get the laws passed.
[01:40:37.809 --> 01:40:43.651]  And we are going to ensure that you start getting laws enforced on you, just like they get enforced on us.
[01:40:44.429 --> 01:40:49.132]  And we are going to win this fight no matter if Bush nukes the city and tries to get martial law going.
[01:40:49.652 --> 01:40:52.274]  You and your boss are going to fail.
[01:40:53.175 --> 01:40:55.936]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:40:55.996 --> 01:40:56.757]  David in Texas.
[01:40:56.797 --> 01:40:57.417]  Go ahead, David.
[01:40:57.838 --> 01:40:58.378]  How you doing?
[01:40:58.558 --> 01:40:58.798]  Good.
[01:40:59.599 --> 01:41:02.160]  I'm up here in North Texas and I was walking through the den.
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:06.483]  I'm home today and I had the TV on the Fox News Network and it was about 11.45 AM.
[01:41:08.786 --> 01:41:12.910]  Yeah, they were talking about Social Security and they had somebody up there, I guess, at Congress.
[01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:17.755]  I didn't catch his name and I didn't pay too much attention, but I did get this.
[01:41:17.775 --> 01:41:26.544]  He was saying that the problem with Social Security is it is indexed to wages and with inflation we need to index it to inflation.
[01:41:27.184 --> 01:41:27.625]  End of quote.
[01:41:28.388 --> 01:41:37.231]  And I ended up going into the kitchen and I realized... And real inflation is at about 10% a year, they say it's 3.5% and really that's true, but go ahead.
[01:41:37.511 --> 01:41:49.195]  Yeah, but your benefits are based on what you pay into it, so based on what your wages are and whatever the tax rate is... Yeah, that shouldn't go down, even though the value of the money you're going to get is lower.
[01:41:49.435 --> 01:41:56.578]  Yeah, but the thing is, right now with your FICA taxes, there is a break on it because it's dependent on how much you earn.
[01:41:57.193 --> 01:42:09.763]  And I guess the guy's proposing to throw all that out, and regardless of what you earn, we're just going to make up a new tax rate every year, and there will be no break on your FICA taxes.
[01:42:10.283 --> 01:42:16.808]  It's like, we're going to have to pay so much miles to travel down the highways, we've got to pay this, we've got to pay this.
[01:42:17.829 --> 01:42:19.610]  Tax-wise, when is this stuff going to end?
[01:42:20.330 --> 01:42:21.011]  It's incredible.
[01:42:21.211 --> 01:42:23.134]  No, the age of conservatism is here.
[01:42:23.915 --> 01:42:33.008]  Never mind if everything's bloated and all our rights are being lost, and taxes are exploding everywhere, and Bush is exploiting La Reconquistas, and anti-gun, pro-abortion people everywhere.
[01:42:33.028 --> 01:42:35.732]  I mean, they're saying this is of the Lord!
[01:42:36.232 --> 01:42:36.933]  Oh, well, thank you.
[01:42:37.033 --> 01:42:38.414]  You make me feel so much better.
[01:42:38.435 --> 01:42:39.135]  It's of the Lord.
[01:42:39.175 --> 01:42:40.036]  I didn't realize that.
[01:42:40.677 --> 01:42:41.858]  Oh, it's all of the Lord.
[01:42:41.898 --> 01:42:42.479]  You didn't know?
[01:42:42.759 --> 01:42:43.320]  No, I didn't know.
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:44.721]  I don't know how you keep it up.
[01:42:44.781 --> 01:42:47.484]  I get so depressed sometimes seeing all this stuff go around.
[01:42:47.744 --> 01:42:48.485]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:42:48.545 --> 01:42:50.007]  We've got the people on our side.
[01:42:50.167 --> 01:42:51.949]  We are actually winning lots of battles.
[01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:56.333]  The globalists are just, they're in control of all the major levers of power.
[01:42:56.993 --> 01:42:59.255]  And so they know we're going to wake up to what they're doing.
[01:42:59.475 --> 01:43:04.100]  That's why they got riot police ready and FEMA camps ready and they got really bad stuff planned.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:07.923]  The key is they need to carry out terror as the pretext for this.
[01:43:08.223 --> 01:43:11.887]  We've got to expose who's behind the terror, then their plan is neutralized thanks to the cold.
[01:43:12.627 --> 01:43:15.250]  Yeah, it's really bad news folks, the stuff they're doing.
[01:43:15.290 --> 01:43:16.651]  We're being looted, we're being raped.
[01:43:17.131 --> 01:43:18.473]  Because China's going to be the new
[01:43:19.787 --> 01:43:20.327]  Superpower.
[01:43:20.487 --> 01:43:24.748]  The globalists have decided to make that their capital, tied in with Europe.
[01:43:25.809 --> 01:43:32.310]  And so, yeah, we're just going to be one big, large, third-world group of everybody taxed.
[01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:34.351]  What's the federal numbers I saw a decade ago?
[01:43:34.771 --> 01:43:38.292]  They were saying by 2020 we'll pay an 87% tax rate.
[01:43:38.972 --> 01:43:39.952]  At the point of a gun!
[01:43:40.552 --> 01:43:43.473]  And you'll be forced psychologically tested and forced drugged.
[01:43:44.934 --> 01:43:46.134]  It's going to be a lot of fun, folks.
[01:43:47.674 --> 01:43:50.019]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:43:50.119 --> 01:43:50.741]  Let's go ahead.
[01:43:50.781 --> 01:43:51.502]  Unless we stop this.
[01:43:52.136 --> 01:43:53.857]  Let's go ahead and talk to Doug in Oregon.
[01:43:53.877 --> 01:43:54.578]  Doug, go ahead.
[01:43:54.838 --> 01:43:55.679]  Hi Alex, how are you doing?
[01:43:55.799 --> 01:43:56.019]  Good.
[01:43:56.379 --> 01:43:58.461]  I'll be real brief and quick so you can move on with other callers.
[01:43:58.781 --> 01:44:01.203]  First of all, I wanted to say your tactic, I've used it well.
[01:44:01.503 --> 01:44:02.164]  It's great.
[01:44:02.224 --> 01:44:06.927]  When you talk about this stuff, always remember to remind people the borders are wide open.
[01:44:06.987 --> 01:44:11.431]  From talk shows to city council meetings, which I've gotten involved in, this has been a great strategy.
[01:44:11.651 --> 01:44:15.434]  Yeah, we've got to give our rights up and have the Pentagon watching us with hover blimps.
[01:44:15.774 --> 01:44:17.135]  And we've got to have everything we do tracked.
[01:44:17.175 --> 01:44:19.297]  But we're going to have the borders wide open, though.
[01:44:19.597 --> 01:44:25.100]  Absolutely, and methamphetamine comes right down to the borders being wide open every single time, so I wanted to thank you for that tactic.
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:29.542]  The other question I want to ask you is, The Great Magazine, The New American, you've read it on air many times.
[01:44:29.602 --> 01:44:30.522]  Have you seen the latest?
[01:44:31.023 --> 01:44:32.643]  Yeah, so what's your opinion on that?
[01:44:32.663 --> 01:44:34.664]  What do you think is going on there?
[01:44:34.684 --> 01:44:36.665]  I'm really confused about this with General Parton.
[01:44:37.546 --> 01:44:38.246]  Why would he do that?
[01:44:38.446 --> 01:44:39.967]  Well, I'm going to get him on the show.
[01:44:40.007 --> 01:44:48.291]  I meant to tell my producer to try to get him on next week, and I've talked to Parton off air six months ago about all this, and
[01:44:50.106 --> 01:44:51.607]  Let me comment on it, thanks for the call.
[01:44:53.128 --> 01:44:55.249]  Without spending all day on this, I just want to say this.
[01:44:56.689 --> 01:45:10.216]  First off, I remember back in, like, 1993-94, the New American Magazine, put out by the John Birch Society, that has a lot of great members, does a lot of great work, said there was no Gulf War illness.
[01:45:11.117 --> 01:45:16.520]  That, basically, the vaccines weren't bad, and the troops weren't sick, and it was all made up.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.681]  Well, I mean, now the government admits it,
[01:45:19.798 --> 01:45:23.259]  Birth defects are triple, and tens of thousands of the troops have died.
[01:45:23.879 --> 01:45:28.540]  The D.U., their army's own handbook that they use, tons and tons, with thousands of tons of.
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:33.741]  And they used three times two years ago there.
[01:45:34.341 --> 01:45:36.541]  It's got a half-life of hundreds of millions of years.
[01:45:37.301 --> 01:45:39.182]  And the government's own handbook says it's deadly.
[01:45:40.942 --> 01:45:46.963]  So, and they admit they gave experimental shots that was illegal to do so, without consent of the troops.
[01:45:47.814 --> 01:45:50.857]  All this guinea pig stuff, and France didn't do it, they've had no problems.
[01:45:51.658 --> 01:45:54.301]  Other than some DU problems, but not from the shots.
[01:45:55.883 --> 01:45:59.146]  So, they did that, and I just said, ah, maybe they're dumb.
[01:46:00.868 --> 01:46:01.829]  Maybe they don't know what they're doing.
[01:46:02.810 --> 01:46:08.296]  And then they had an article back in like 98, there are no black helicopters, it's made up, it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:46:08.860 --> 01:46:34.581]  Because, I mean, I was taking the magazine at the time, and I'm, like, in Texas at the time with it in the front page of the San Antonio Express News, Austin American Statesman, Houston Chronicle, Corpus Christi Caller Times, Kingsville Record, just, you know, trying to bribe people, helicopters crashing into buildings, things blowing up, bullets going into restaurants, Miami Herald, just foreign troops running around screaming explosions.
[01:46:36.087 --> 01:46:37.168]  And they're saying it doesn't exist.
[01:46:37.208 --> 01:46:38.668]  So, I told the story last week.
[01:46:38.688 --> 01:46:39.629]  People raised this point.
[01:46:40.810 --> 01:46:43.811]  I'm there at Urban Warrior in 99, and this is in Police State 2000.
[01:46:44.592 --> 01:46:45.152]  Early on in 9.
[01:46:45.352 --> 01:46:49.094]  And I'm on this little knoll, about 50 yards away, are troops swarming.
[01:46:49.134 --> 01:46:57.038]  Marines, foreign Dutch, German troops, Israeli troops, French troops, Australian troops, practicing to put Americans in camps.
[01:46:57.379 --> 01:46:58.379]  They got role players.
[01:46:58.419 --> 01:46:59.640]  I'm an American, not the camp!
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:00.660]  You know, they're interrogating them.
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:01.821]  Where'd you get the weapons?
[01:47:02.381 --> 01:47:03.742]  I'm from San Francisco, you know.
[01:47:06.028 --> 01:47:09.731]  And I look over and it's William F. Jasper, who I've asked to be on the show many times.
[01:47:10.671 --> 01:47:12.032]  One of their chief writers and editors.
[01:47:12.073 --> 01:47:14.074]  And I go, Mr. Jasper, he's literally five feet from me.
[01:47:14.735 --> 01:47:25.543]  I go, I got a backpack right here, because I was doing radio, you know, that morning, Collins on my own show, on this network, by the way, with the articles.
[01:47:26.044 --> 01:47:32.209]  So I pulled out an AP article about more attempted bribery and black helicopter depth of delta force drills in San Antonio.
[01:47:32.889 --> 01:47:34.651]  He goes, wow, I didn't know about this.
[01:47:35.598 --> 01:47:42.243]  And a month later, the next issue, that was in there, the exact article.
[01:47:42.804 --> 01:47:44.105]  He went and put it in there.
[01:47:45.866 --> 01:47:49.589]  So, I don't, you know, this is one of the few groups I just don't know.
[01:47:49.709 --> 01:47:51.591]  I think they're like living in their own little bubble.
[01:47:52.932 --> 01:47:54.573]  They don't really recruit new members.
[01:47:54.653 --> 01:47:57.435]  They don't really do much, folks.
[01:47:57.475 --> 01:48:00.698]  And they put out some good videos and books and stuff, and that's about it.
[01:48:01.608 --> 01:48:15.718]  In this latest thing, you know, Alex Jones believes there were bombs in the buildings and Alex Jones had an article on his website written by somebody else that we linked to about the seismologist saying there were bombs.
[01:48:15.738 --> 01:48:16.438]  Well, they did say that.
[01:48:17.559 --> 01:48:18.900]  That was in major New York papers.
[01:48:20.841 --> 01:48:22.702]  I mean, Larry Silverstein says they blew it up!
[01:48:23.003 --> 01:48:25.804]  I mean, Building 7 blew up!
[01:48:25.885 --> 01:48:27.786]  I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to do!
[01:48:29.089 --> 01:48:36.891]  Now, General Parton is attacking the Pentagon situation and saying that the plane incinerated that was going so fast.
[01:48:38.471 --> 01:48:41.912]  And, of course, General Parton has exposed government involvement in Oklahoma City.
[01:48:42.392 --> 01:48:47.553]  And I talked to Parton right after 9-11, and he told me on the phone, he said, Alex, I'm still an officer.
[01:48:48.134 --> 01:48:49.834]  I could be called up anytime.
[01:48:52.255 --> 01:48:53.075]  It could be treason.
[01:48:54.015 --> 01:48:57.896]  And he goes, I'm just not going to talk about 9-11 with you.
[01:48:59.895 --> 01:49:02.336]  So I don't know what's going on with Parton.
[01:49:02.396 --> 01:49:03.577]  Six months ago I talked to him.
[01:49:03.617 --> 01:49:10.319]  I had him on about he was arguing with the Pentagon's new map and Thomas Barnett and all that stuff.
[01:49:10.379 --> 01:49:11.240]  And I agreed with him there.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:18.263]  I just think it's a little too much for Parton and them to... That's why I've had a problem.
[01:49:18.383 --> 01:49:19.083]  And I've had them on.
[01:49:19.123 --> 01:49:20.644]  I think it's important information.
[01:49:20.964 --> 01:49:23.585]  With the pods, even though we're one of the first to talk about it.
[01:49:24.225 --> 01:49:26.486]  With the pods and the Pentagon.
[01:49:26.506 --> 01:49:28.787]  That's why we don't really focus on that because
[01:49:30.909 --> 01:49:32.330]  It's just so open for debate.
[01:49:32.370 --> 01:49:33.530]  It's so fantastic.
[01:49:34.331 --> 01:49:37.412]  Though there's serious evidence in them pointing it out.
[01:49:37.472 --> 01:49:38.072]  It's important.
[01:49:38.633 --> 01:49:39.613]  People can't deal with it.
[01:49:39.993 --> 01:49:42.594]  That's why I talk about public officials who are not to fly.
[01:49:42.654 --> 01:49:43.735]  CIA insider trading.
[01:49:44.115 --> 01:49:45.436]  Norad ordered to stand down.
[01:49:45.716 --> 01:49:47.256]  Bin Laden being CIA.
[01:49:47.677 --> 01:49:49.657]  Flying Al-Qaeda out to safety in the U.S.
[01:49:49.677 --> 01:49:50.418]  and Afghanistan.
[01:49:50.658 --> 01:49:53.079]  Hundreds of those points that no one seems to be talking about.
[01:49:53.619 --> 01:49:57.945]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.125 --> 01:50:02.490]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:04.940 --> 01:50:05.860]  What's this disaster?
[01:50:06.201 --> 01:50:07.101]  The New World Order.
[01:50:07.121 --> 01:50:08.502]  The New World Order?
[01:50:09.202 --> 01:50:10.003]  Pan-American.
[01:50:10.263 --> 01:50:14.485]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.545 --> 01:50:21.488]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.608 --> 01:50:23.669]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.970 --> 01:50:34.315]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.855 --> 01:50:40.001]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[01:52:54.299 --> 01:52:59.421]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.081 --> 01:53:05.643]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:05.963 --> 01:53:07.944]  All I've ever said about 9-11 is this.
[01:53:07.964 --> 01:53:09.864]  We should look at all the evidence.
[01:53:10.785 --> 01:53:20.068]  And I believe the most effective attacks that cannot be deflected or defeated when concerning the proof of government orchestration of 9-11
[01:53:21.963 --> 01:53:25.144]  is to focus on the things that cannot be debated.
[01:53:25.925 --> 01:53:31.307]  8,000 Taliban Al-Qaeda leaders were put on C-130s and flown out to safety to Pakistan by the U.S.
[01:53:31.327 --> 01:53:31.627]  government.
[01:53:32.067 --> 01:53:36.369]  General Mahmoud Ahmed wired $100,000 to Mohammed Adam, known CIA officer.
[01:53:38.170 --> 01:53:41.832]  He was meeting with Bush, all of them, in the week before 9-11.
[01:53:42.592 --> 01:53:44.233]  Second trip of his life here to the U.S.
[01:53:46.333 --> 01:53:49.655]  Condoleezza Rice calling Mayor Willie Brown up saying don't fly to New York tomorrow.
[01:53:50.746 --> 01:54:08.093]  CIA drills, the stand-downs, the CIA insider trading, the hijackers having their houses, cars, and credit cards paid for by the government, FBI agents being ordered not to stop the Al-Qaeda groups, being told it was national security, coming out that they were on the payroll, the U.S.
[01:54:08.113 --> 01:54:09.654]  government thought they were part of a drill.
[01:54:11.115 --> 01:54:15.376]  But that's why everybody needs to get martial law, 9-11, rise of the police state.
[01:54:15.736 --> 01:54:16.757]  Because a full hour
[01:54:18.072 --> 01:54:23.073]  of this three-hour film, this mini-series, is on 9-11.
[01:54:23.253 --> 01:54:29.595]  Just get the film, make copies of that hour alone, and give that to people, and then say, if you want the whole film, here it is.
[01:54:30.475 --> 01:54:33.476]  Because, I mean, this is blowing people away.
[01:54:33.516 --> 01:54:38.538]  We just go through everything that can be proven, and then we finally show you how the globalists did 9-11.
[01:54:41.098 --> 01:54:43.919]  And, uh, you really need to have this film.
[01:54:43.959 --> 01:54:45.380]  You need it, you need it, you need it.
[01:54:47.856 --> 01:54:49.336]  We've got some distributor deals.
[01:54:49.697 --> 01:54:53.358]  If you want to order them in bulk, you can call 512-291-5750.
[01:54:53.378 --> 01:54:56.979]  And if you buy enough of the DVDs, I'll sell them as low as $12 apiece.
[01:54:57.059 --> 01:54:58.219]  VHS is more.
[01:54:58.239 --> 01:55:00.459]  I'll sell those for $14 apiece.
[01:55:00.480 --> 01:55:02.420]  You can get one copy for $24.95 or a second copy for $19.95.
[01:55:14.924 --> 01:55:18.165]  A third copy for $16.95 and it just goes down and down and down.
[01:55:18.185 --> 01:55:21.987]  Or just get one copy and make copies of it.
[01:55:22.387 --> 01:55:22.867]  Please.
[01:55:23.807 --> 01:55:25.188]  It is such an important film.
[01:55:25.288 --> 01:55:26.488]  It needs to be seen.
[01:55:26.969 --> 01:55:28.309]  Please help us.
[01:55:28.809 --> 01:55:30.390]  Get 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny.
[01:55:31.150 --> 01:55:32.271]  Get The Masters of Terror.
[01:55:32.611 --> 01:55:36.132]  Those are both 9-11 films I've made that go right off what's admitted.
[01:55:37.273 --> 01:55:39.774]  The stuff the media won't touch with a 10-foot pole.
[01:55:39.834 --> 01:55:43.535]  They will attack and try to debunk things that can't be proven either way.
[01:55:44.511 --> 01:55:50.172]  They will not touch with a ten-foot pole the hundreds of real issues that cannot be debated.
[01:55:51.053 --> 01:55:52.533]  That's why this film is so powerful.
[01:55:52.553 --> 01:55:53.513]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:53.533 --> 01:55:53.573]  888-253-3139.
[01:55:53.593 --> 01:55:56.374]  Call right now and get the films.
[01:55:56.394 --> 01:55:56.714]  Do not wait.
[01:56:09.815 --> 01:56:10.376]  No crazy.
[01:56:10.436 --> 01:56:11.617]  Just make hundreds of copies.
[01:56:11.637 --> 01:56:12.338]  Some of you have done that.
[01:56:12.819 --> 01:56:14.061]  This new film needs to be seen.
[01:56:14.101 --> 01:56:14.481]  Help us.
[01:56:14.501 --> 01:56:15.202]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:56:15.222 --> 01:56:16.163]  Or just write to me.
[01:56:16.264 --> 01:56:19.067]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:56:29.528 --> 01:56:31.970]  And of course, in our films, we also spend time on their motive.
[01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:33.190]  Why they wanted to do this.
[01:56:33.791 --> 01:56:35.972]  Who was the head of security on 9-11?
[01:56:36.352 --> 01:56:37.033]  Things like that.
[01:56:37.053 --> 01:56:38.134]  Just hundreds of points.
[01:56:38.714 --> 01:56:41.616]  Destroying the tapes.
[01:56:42.236 --> 01:56:46.579]  The air traffic control tapes under Bush's orders.
[01:56:46.599 --> 01:56:51.022]  1-888-253-3139 or Infowars.com.
[01:56:51.522 --> 01:56:52.503]  Secure shopping cart.
[01:56:52.983 --> 01:56:54.944]  I got half the film up there for free right now.
[01:56:54.984 --> 01:56:55.545]  You can go watch

[01:57:10.144 --> 01:57:11.665]  Get it out there on the share networks.
[01:57:12.585 --> 01:57:14.606]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.

[01:57:17.946 --> 01:57:18.967]  Get Martial Law.
[01:57:19.047 --> 01:57:20.367]  It needs to be seen.
[01:57:21.827 --> 01:57:22.788]  It is amazing.
[01:57:22.828 --> 01:57:24.268]  It is changing hearts and minds.
[01:57:25.071 --> 01:57:26.451]  Third hour will start in minutes.
[01:57:26.511 --> 01:57:28.792]  I'll go straight to your calls and then back into the news.
[01:57:28.812 --> 01:57:35.914]  Paul Watson's joining us for a very interesting update on Illuminati language hidden in plain view.
[01:57:35.934 --> 01:57:39.015]  We're only 70 seconds away from the third hour.
[01:57:39.475 --> 01:57:41.675]  Stay with us.
[01:57:49.837 --> 01:57:50.478]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.138 --> 01:57:52.118]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.914 --> 01:57:53.995]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.676 --> 01:57:55.496]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.257 --> 01:57:57.138]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.158 --> 01:58:01.461]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.982 --> 01:58:06.105]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.767 --> 01:58:12.531]  Let's just continue with the phone calls, because the callers are bringing up all the really important news.
[01:58:14.893 --> 01:58:17.415]  Already into hour number three on this live Friday edition.
[01:58:17.435 --> 01:58:18.776]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:58:20.353 --> 01:58:23.955]  Up next here, I guess, would be Don in Ohio.
[01:58:23.975 --> 01:58:25.335]  Go ahead, Don.
[01:58:25.856 --> 01:58:29.917]  Yeah, although I didn't watch his speech yesterday, I did watch Nightline.
[01:58:29.937 --> 01:58:45.844]  It was supposed to be about a different show, but Ted Koppel was talking to a few reporters about the softballs basically being lobbed at Bush, and one of them said something about that he heard Bush say that the Social Security is going to have to be
[01:58:47.395 --> 01:58:48.956]  Cut down or something.
[01:58:49.256 --> 01:58:52.437]  So much of a percent has to be taken out of it.
[01:58:52.917 --> 01:58:55.058]  And when they figured it out, it was like $3 trillion.
[01:58:55.218 --> 01:58:56.499]  Ted Koppel didn't catch it.
[01:58:56.719 --> 01:59:01.021]  The other guy says, you know, that Bush wants to take $3 trillion out of that.
[01:59:02.021 --> 01:59:03.962]  I didn't see it, so I don't know if that's true or not.
[01:59:04.683 --> 01:59:10.405]  Second thought is you get the General back on, ask him about where those three mysterious ships at sea are.
[01:59:11.506 --> 01:59:15.627]  And just another reminder for people to watch Book TV tomorrow, 1030 Eastern Time.
[01:59:18.315 --> 01:59:22.776]  Watch David Ray Griffin's 9-11 Commission Report, Omissions and Distortions.
[01:59:23.196 --> 01:59:23.716]  That's what I got.
[01:59:24.276 --> 01:59:28.057]  That's going to be powerful, and is that 10-30 Eastern or Central?
[01:59:28.597 --> 01:59:28.877]  Eastern.
[01:59:29.838 --> 01:59:35.319]  Well, I'll hopefully remember to tape that, but if I don't, somebody needs to really send me a copy of that.
[01:59:35.639 --> 01:59:36.659]  How long is that going to be?
[01:59:37.399 --> 01:59:43.980]  It's got 10-30, the next one's at 12 o'clock, so hopefully it'll be that long.
[01:59:44.421 --> 01:59:46.441]  He's got an hour and a half, well that's exciting.
[01:59:47.408 --> 01:59:57.313]  So if people watch that, let C-SPAN know that you want them to bring more interviews and stuff like that to book TV.
[01:59:57.353 --> 01:59:58.434]  That would be a good idea.
[01:59:58.574 --> 02:00:04.897]  Well, I mean, C-SPAN's done a bunch of hit pieces on myself over and over again, and they'll never allow me on to respond.
[02:00:04.957 --> 02:00:08.478]  I had to basically ambush them at the RNC to get on TV.
[02:00:09.459 --> 02:00:12.600]  You know, got in line with a crowd of delegates and just said, hey, put me on.
[02:00:12.620 --> 02:00:15.142]  They didn't want to look like they were censoring, so they did.
[02:00:16.638 --> 02:00:17.819]  60 seconds, I gave it to him.
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:19.000]  Have you ever seen that?
[02:00:19.621 --> 02:00:20.021]  No, I haven't.
[02:00:20.361 --> 02:00:22.103]  That's in the film, Martial Law, by the way.
[02:00:22.843 --> 02:00:25.165]  I've got it down, but I just haven't watched it yet.
[02:00:25.185 --> 02:00:27.287]  Well, please burn some copies.
[02:00:27.307 --> 02:00:27.968]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:28.848 --> 02:00:30.830]  Alright, that's all I ask people to do.
[02:00:30.950 --> 02:00:31.791]  Spread the word.
[02:00:31.811 --> 02:00:32.711]  It's so important.
[02:00:33.792 --> 02:00:38.716]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Dan in Texas.
[02:00:38.756 --> 02:00:39.377]  Go ahead, Dan.
[02:00:39.837 --> 02:00:40.478]  Morning, Alex.
[02:00:40.638 --> 02:00:40.918]  Hello.
[02:00:41.418 --> 02:00:45.542]  I just want to say, first off, Dan, it has truly been a blessing finding your show.
[02:00:46.212 --> 02:00:49.053]  Both on the shortwave, as well as the computer.
[02:00:49.273 --> 02:00:50.614]  It's a fantastic show.
[02:00:50.634 --> 02:00:58.277]  Second, I'd like to say I'm from a city just north of you, maybe a couple hundred miles, that is divided by a state line.
[02:00:59.517 --> 02:01:02.638]  Part of it is in Texas, part of it is in Arkansas.
[02:01:03.279 --> 02:01:11.862]  Just recently, since both sides of the city has a mayor for each side, a city council for each side, a police department for each side,
[02:01:12.594 --> 02:01:22.082]  They have signed an agreement now to where both police departments can cross each other's city lines and answer calls on either side.
[02:01:22.242 --> 02:01:23.203]  That's really bad.
[02:01:23.243 --> 02:01:25.184]  There's a reason we have jurisdictions.
[02:01:26.205 --> 02:01:31.749]  And I can't help but believe that that's part of a new world order movement going on here.
[02:01:31.789 --> 02:01:35.552]  These MJTF, multi-jurisdictional task forces, it's happening everywhere.
[02:01:35.973 --> 02:01:37.894]  And they sign agreements with the feds, you name it.
[02:01:38.255 --> 02:01:39.636]  It's good to have separation.
[02:01:39.656 --> 02:01:42.298]  Because if you've got a bad county, it's good to be able to get away from it.
[02:01:42.907 --> 02:01:46.589]  And Alex, I'd also like to challenge you maybe for a future show.
[02:01:47.129 --> 02:01:51.731]  We know that America is falling apart, going to hell when the handbasket has to say.
[02:01:51.872 --> 02:01:58.975]  Real quick, like, I would like to know how you feel first about our militias here in the United States.
[02:01:59.695 --> 02:02:08.640]  And then secondly, challenge you maybe, if that's the correct words, to have a show, maybe a dedicated hour or something simulated around
[02:02:09.403 --> 02:02:25.258]  Speaking with some of the militia leaders you know even in Texas as well as the other states about the things that are going on in America leading us to this road to the new world order and what their beliefs are and what at what point would they take action against
[02:02:26.281 --> 02:02:28.964]  Uh, the coming gun grabs, etc.
[02:02:29.425 --> 02:02:30.366]  That'd be a good interview.
[02:02:30.426 --> 02:02:31.827]  I think I'll try to set that up.
[02:02:32.348 --> 02:02:33.789]  I'd love to hear it, Alex.
[02:02:33.929 --> 02:02:36.332]  And again, thank you so much for the good job you're doing.
[02:02:36.352 --> 02:02:36.972]  Oh no, my friend.
[02:02:37.012 --> 02:02:38.534]  Thank you for listening and being involved.
[02:02:38.574 --> 02:02:39.315]  Take care, Dan.
[02:02:40.096 --> 02:02:41.777]  Uh, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:41.797 --> 02:02:42.178]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.373 --> 02:02:52.238]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.539 --> 02:02:53.920]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.322]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.462 --> 02:02:58.563]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.824 --> 02:03:03.767]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.108 --> 02:03:08.131]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.371 --> 02:03:10.153]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.233 --> 02:03:20.885]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.045 --> 02:03:22.908]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:05:49.937 --> 02:05:50.597]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.237 --> 02:05:52.297]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.018 --> 02:05:54.138]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.758 --> 02:05:55.599]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.339 --> 02:05:57.319]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:01.541]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.081 --> 02:06:06.243]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:15.546 --> 02:06:17.007]  I do support the militia.
[02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:35.155]  A caller in the last little segment, that some stations don't carry, that first little five minute segment, the start of each hour, was asking me my views on the militia and if I was going to have a show about the militia and what the response would be to all this tyranny.
[02:06:36.777 --> 02:06:40.240]  Well, every man in this country is a member of the militia.
[02:06:41.101 --> 02:06:41.722]  From what, like 18 to 56?
[02:06:45.347 --> 02:06:46.988]  And I say every woman is in the militia.
[02:06:47.168 --> 02:06:48.789]  I mean, we're here to defend this country.
[02:06:50.250 --> 02:06:51.851]  It's the same thing in Switzerland.
[02:06:52.071 --> 02:06:56.013]  And they've got the lowest crime rate in the industrialized world and never get invaded.
[02:06:57.314 --> 02:06:59.215]  And they hand out the automatic weapons there.
[02:06:59.235 --> 02:07:01.636]  They're not worried about their population there.
[02:07:01.656 --> 02:07:03.657]  They teach them how to build bombs.
[02:07:05.138 --> 02:07:11.141]  They have inspections of their homes to make sure they've hidden their firearms correctly in case they ever get overrun.
[02:07:11.742 --> 02:07:12.802]  So they get fined if
[02:07:14.597 --> 02:07:16.098]  The police can find their guns.
[02:07:18.519 --> 02:07:19.760]  You have to have hidden guns.
[02:07:21.401 --> 02:07:24.143]  You can have your own guns, but the guns the government gives you have to be hidden.
[02:07:25.764 --> 02:07:26.344]  Interesting, huh?
[02:07:27.325 --> 02:07:28.706]  Pretty pathetic what we've turned into.
[02:07:28.726 --> 02:07:30.007]  That's how we used to be in the past.
[02:07:30.647 --> 02:07:37.331]  But, uh, the problem with what you call the classical militia... Take the Minutemen in Arizona.
[02:07:37.351 --> 02:07:39.232]  I mean, just out there with launchers calling the police.
[02:07:39.252 --> 02:07:40.213]  That's like civil defense.
[02:07:41.053 --> 02:07:41.794]  That's the militia.
[02:07:44.028 --> 02:07:55.397]  You know, they took what you'd call the normal, unregulated militia and put that into the regulator, the National Guard, the State Guards, and now they're turning those into militarized arms against the people.
[02:07:57.038 --> 02:08:13.671]  My problem is, with what you'd call the classical militia of the 1990s, is you'd go to one of these meetings, you know, just to cover it, or just to check it out, everybody was acting paranoid, freaked out, there were provocateurs all over the place,
[02:08:14.832 --> 02:08:19.173]  The slinking around in camo doesn't do anything.
[02:08:20.473 --> 02:08:25.214]  I'm a member of the militia when I'm in a suit in front of the city council fighting the Patriot Act.
[02:08:26.095 --> 02:08:29.895]  I'm a member of the militia when I go out with video cameras and show police at a checkpoint.
[02:08:30.555 --> 02:08:31.716]  I'm defending this country.
[02:08:34.036 --> 02:08:37.317]  And so I just don't get all the camo and stuff because
[02:08:39.179 --> 02:08:44.683]  Real camouflage in an urban setting is an Izod t-shirt and khakis and dress shoes.
[02:08:46.044 --> 02:08:46.764]  And a backpack.
[02:08:47.925 --> 02:08:54.970]  I really have just a lot of problems with some of the people that ran it.
[02:08:58.092 --> 02:08:59.873]  It turned out a lot of them were feds.
[02:08:59.993 --> 02:09:01.574]  They're trying to burn good people.
[02:09:02.895 --> 02:09:06.398]  And it just turned into a general mess.
[02:09:07.409 --> 02:09:09.470]  So call yourselves whatever you want to call yourselves.
[02:09:10.490 --> 02:09:11.830]  But I believe in the militia.
[02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.811]  I am the militia.
[02:09:13.231 --> 02:09:14.111]  You are the militia.
[02:09:15.171 --> 02:09:16.912]  And I'm in my uniform right now.
[02:09:16.972 --> 02:09:18.952]  I'm wearing tennis shoes and shorts and a t-shirt.
[02:09:20.813 --> 02:09:22.093]  I'm in uniform, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:22.794 --> 02:09:26.855]  Alright, let's go ahead and go back to some calls.
[02:09:27.795 --> 02:09:29.916]  Let's go ahead and talk to
[02:09:32.014 --> 02:09:32.875]  Sean in Michigan.
[02:09:32.895 --> 02:09:33.696]  Go ahead, Sean.
[02:09:34.056 --> 02:09:34.776]  Yes, Alex.
[02:09:34.816 --> 02:09:39.921]  First off, I'd like to thank you for all of your excellent work in waking me up and giving me the opportunity to wake others up.
[02:09:40.301 --> 02:09:45.185]  I'm in Michigan over here, and I have to say, this is one place where the Matrix is really, really strong.
[02:09:45.225 --> 02:09:52.871]  I mean, it's a wasteland of Starbucks and shopping malls, and I mean, people, like, once they see this information, you know, I mean, they start talking about it.
[02:09:52.911 --> 02:09:54.112]  They start talking to their friends.
[02:09:54.132 --> 02:09:56.834]  You know, I burn them copies, and I mean, the systems.
[02:09:56.894 --> 02:09:59.917]  I can just see a fragment of the Matrix falling out every day.
[02:10:00.658 --> 02:10:02.079]  I mean, it's really encouraging.
[02:10:02.439 --> 02:10:05.581]  No, everywhere people are waking up, they're getting involved.
[02:10:05.601 --> 02:10:15.708]  I mean, the government ordered the police, a million and a half police and firemen and medical workers to take the experimental smallpox shot and 99.9% said no under orders.
[02:10:15.728 --> 02:10:15.788]  Oof!
[02:10:19.930 --> 02:10:27.802]  It's so many places, so many things, they know that people are seeing through it, so they try to just say, so what?
[02:10:27.842 --> 02:10:30.225]  Okay, that's the way it is, go along with it.
[02:10:30.245 --> 02:10:31.207]  Right, right.
[02:10:31.247 --> 02:10:32.569]  If I could just ask my question right now.
[02:10:32.609 --> 02:10:34.692]  Can I actually see this New World Order
[02:10:35.302 --> 02:10:36.123]  Reacting to us.
[02:10:36.343 --> 02:10:40.246]  I mean every time you're just watching the news and you just see him make a couple moves, you know, the chess game.
[02:10:40.746 --> 02:10:43.528]  But what I'm saying is, you know, what's the next thing?
[02:10:43.568 --> 02:10:49.732]  I'm sure you're aware that 9-11 was, I'm sorry, the Madrid train bombing was on 3-11, was 911 days after 9-11.
[02:10:52.134 --> 02:10:53.796]  And it was a total government operation.
[02:10:53.876 --> 02:10:54.517]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:10:54.617 --> 02:10:55.738]  It's just numerology, though.
[02:10:55.858 --> 02:10:56.519]  I mean, that's why we do it.
[02:10:56.559 --> 02:10:58.021]  I mean, not just numerology.
[02:10:58.121 --> 02:11:01.684]  And we're going to be talking about the Illuminati secret language here in a few minutes, sir.
[02:11:03.006 --> 02:11:03.727]  It's the evidence.
[02:11:03.747 --> 02:11:06.189]  I mean, hundreds of thousands protested.
[02:11:06.229 --> 02:11:09.553]  They had signs saying, the day after, that the government did it.
[02:11:09.793 --> 02:11:11.675]  And it turned out the government was involved.
[02:11:11.915 --> 02:11:13.357]  Yeah, there's no question about that.
[02:11:13.985 --> 02:11:18.191]  I mean, that's, I mean, the towers, I mean, that's completely irrefutable right there.
[02:11:18.231 --> 02:11:22.817]  There's no other explanation, you know, why those towers fell down.
[02:11:23.498 --> 02:11:24.900]  Are you making copies of my new film?
[02:11:25.040 --> 02:11:26.121]  Yes, sir!
[02:11:26.161 --> 02:11:27.263]  You are just awesome!
[02:11:27.303 --> 02:11:28.765]  What effect does it have, uh, have it?
[02:11:29.245 --> 02:11:30.185]  Oh, I mean, it's amazing.
[02:11:30.205 --> 02:11:32.566]  I've given it to some of my professors.
[02:11:32.746 --> 02:11:35.166]  I've given it out to my friends, you know, like I said.
[02:11:35.527 --> 02:11:38.647]  I mean, they'll start talking about it on their own, you know, more people know.
[02:11:39.047 --> 02:11:42.908]  I mean, the government, like you said, the government has an all-time low credibility level.
[02:11:43.248 --> 02:11:44.249]  Nobody's trusting them.
[02:11:44.329 --> 02:11:45.369]  Nobody's buying the fraud.
[02:11:45.509 --> 02:11:49.350]  Everybody knows that they're corrupt, you know, and this movie is just like, you know,
[02:11:49.890 --> 02:11:52.752]  The absolute nuclear bomb of this information war.
[02:11:52.872 --> 02:11:54.553]  I mean, because people can actually watch it.
[02:11:54.573 --> 02:11:56.855]  You know, like, the worst thing is cutting through their attention span.
[02:11:57.175 --> 02:12:00.077]  You know, most people can't stand to watch through 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[02:12:00.478 --> 02:12:03.960]  You know, because it's not as, you know, exciting and the budget wasn't as low, you know?
[02:12:04.120 --> 02:12:06.282]  But I mean, that's the good thing about this movie.
[02:12:06.302 --> 02:12:09.584]  You know, if people can actually watch it, we can cut through their short attention span.
[02:12:10.184 --> 02:12:12.206]  And, uh, yeah, I just want to thank you for all your work.
[02:12:13.041 --> 02:12:14.762]  Well, I appreciate what you're doing.
[02:12:14.882 --> 02:12:18.005]  Please ask your friends to make copies themselves.
[02:12:18.105 --> 02:12:19.866]  That's where the real power comes from.
[02:12:20.086 --> 02:12:20.526]  Yes, sir.
[02:12:20.566 --> 02:12:20.927]  Will do.
[02:12:21.387 --> 02:12:22.368]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:12:22.408 --> 02:12:22.908]  You keep it up.
[02:12:22.948 --> 02:12:24.089]  That was an exciting call.
[02:12:25.350 --> 02:12:27.711]  Very, very, very exciting.
[02:12:28.232 --> 02:12:28.772]  I love it.
[02:12:31.054 --> 02:12:32.174]  Let's talk to Rob.
[02:12:32.194 --> 02:12:35.537]  I always get these calls mixed up.
[02:12:35.557 --> 02:12:36.157]  Who's up next?
[02:12:37.458 --> 02:12:39.880]  Rogers before Rob and Ruben.
[02:12:40.567 --> 02:12:41.887]  A lot of R's today.
[02:12:42.267 --> 02:12:43.808]  Go ahead, Roger.
[02:12:44.228 --> 02:12:45.388]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:12:45.428 --> 02:12:46.448]  Two items quickly.
[02:12:46.809 --> 02:13:00.872]  First is, a couple nights back, George Norrie's regular feature guest, Richard C. Hoagland, apparently just for the first time discovered whole nests of secret societies in NASA.
[02:13:01.432 --> 02:13:03.993]  The National Aeronautical Space Administration.
[02:13:04.033 --> 02:13:07.593]  I guess he presumably is going to go on at more length in the future.
[02:13:07.633 --> 02:13:09.714]  Well, I mean, they discovered that new planetoid
[02:13:10.674 --> 02:13:17.915]  Out past, it's not really a planet, it's smaller than our moon, out past Pluto, and they gave it some satanic goddess name.
[02:13:18.115 --> 02:13:20.396]  Every mission has a Luciferian name.
[02:13:20.676 --> 02:13:24.576]  The whole thing is done on numerological dates.
[02:13:24.596 --> 02:13:26.197]  I mean, everybody knows about NASA.
[02:13:26.517 --> 02:13:28.137]  And he was one of the chief people there.
[02:13:28.377 --> 02:13:29.377]  He just discovered this.
[02:13:29.837 --> 02:13:39.439]  Well, I suspect coming soon to a radio near you is going to be some weak caricature straw man piece, but that's just a guess.
[02:13:44.884 --> 02:14:00.671]  I don't know if there's anything that John McManus hasn't done to kill the Birch Society, and he's not really the best spokesman for the society, so I groan every time I hear one of these interviews.
[02:14:01.312 --> 02:14:03.413]  For all I know, he might be a real nice guy.
[02:14:05.359 --> 02:14:06.963]  He is a poor spokesman, okay?
[02:14:07.545 --> 02:14:11.275]  And what gets me, what happened to the days
[02:14:12.686 --> 02:14:16.349]  In Robert Walsh's view, there was no such thing as bad press.
[02:14:16.409 --> 02:14:18.730]  Bad press was better than no press at all.
[02:14:18.750 --> 02:14:21.452]  Well, that's when they were growing and doing a great job.
[02:14:21.792 --> 02:14:26.936]  Yeah, so what is this new doctrine of not doing interviews, even critical interviews?
[02:14:27.016 --> 02:14:28.156]  It's not like the controlled media.
[02:14:28.176 --> 02:14:28.397]  No, no, no.
[02:14:28.437 --> 02:14:29.257]  These aren't critical.
[02:14:29.377 --> 02:14:31.879]  I can never get any of them on for years.
[02:14:32.219 --> 02:14:33.700]  And then I was certain that they were agents.
[02:14:34.240 --> 02:14:39.464]  But I see Jasper and I give him an article and it ends up in their newspaper.
[02:14:39.884 --> 02:14:40.124]  Yeah.
[02:14:40.204 --> 02:14:42.745]  So, I mean, I just think they're living under a rock or something.
[02:14:42.785 --> 02:14:52.428]  Well, I mean, they would be taking some barbs, and I would say rightly so, and perhaps answer and get their... It isn't like these pre-packaged, you know, they do this two hours.
[02:14:52.448 --> 02:14:53.008]  Well, exactly.
[02:14:53.048 --> 02:14:56.009]  Look, when you're in the arena, everything isn't ever going to be perfect.
[02:14:56.049 --> 02:14:57.210]  None of us are going to be 100%.
[02:14:57.570 --> 02:15:01.211]  Well, it's not like one of these god-awful TV things where you get two hours of entertainment.
[02:15:01.231 --> 02:15:03.152]  I got a word for the John Burns Society today.
[02:15:03.612 --> 02:15:04.112]  Cowed.
[02:15:04.887 --> 02:15:17.398]  Well, but you know, it's not like a TV interview where they repackage your two hours into a five minute cut and hatchet job where they don't have any... No, if Jasper would come on this show, I'd give him an hour and let him say whatever he wanted.
[02:15:17.478 --> 02:15:25.605]  If you'd be cutting him short, you'd have people like me and others calling in to complain or you'd get them back on and give them a little, you know, breathing room there as well.
[02:15:26.265 --> 02:15:28.986]  I've tried over and over and over and over again.
[02:15:29.506 --> 02:15:32.426]  I've tried to get them on to support their FTAA move.
[02:15:32.907 --> 02:15:38.128]  I want to make sure to see David Joyce's video and read the TNA article as well.
[02:15:49.525 --> 02:15:53.587]  You know, they had a little time to pitch their rule as well in there, but that wasn't really my point.
[02:15:54.368 --> 02:16:05.674]  What I was getting at is... I'm taking you're probably not happy with the expression of a week or so ago, the neocon birchers.
[02:16:06.715 --> 02:16:13.238]  When you use that expression, I mean, I take it you're not... The article is very neocon-ish, thanks for the call.
[02:16:13.979 --> 02:16:16.060]  I mean, that's all I can say about it.
[02:16:17.078 --> 02:16:20.381]  Let's go ahead and talk to Reuben in Ohio.
[02:16:20.441 --> 02:16:21.162]  Reuben, go ahead.
[02:16:21.762 --> 02:16:33.752]  Hey Alex, this is in the 9-11 report and maybe I'm just crazy or maybe it's something but you've always said that they love to throw their numerology and symbols right in your face, right?
[02:16:34.312 --> 02:16:34.573]  Yes.
[02:16:35.113 --> 02:16:43.480]  So if you go to page 32 and 33 they have a timeline of when all four planes crash and say for example
[02:16:44.315 --> 02:16:47.457]  Flight 11 crashes at 84640.
[02:16:48.177 --> 02:16:52.760]  Well, I want to point out to you that the last three digits of that are suspicious.
[02:16:52.780 --> 02:16:52.760]  640.
[02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:53.780]  Okay?
[02:16:54.020 --> 02:16:55.541]  Stay with me for one more second here.
[02:16:56.822 --> 02:16:57.902]  Flight 175, it crashes at 90311.
[02:16:57.982 --> 02:16:59.483]  So the last three digits of that is 311.
[02:17:05.629 --> 02:17:06.990]  So that number's in your face.
[02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:15.874]  And the flights are 11, and the towers look like an 11, and the Masonic rituals, they knock down two big towers and rebuild them, and on and on and on.
[02:17:16.294 --> 02:17:22.958]  Right, and Flight 93 crashes at 10-03-11, but then Flight 77 crashes at 7-46.
[02:17:23.218 --> 02:17:28.961]  What I'm saying is, 3-11 comes up twice in this, and 6-4 comes up twice, so I don't know
[02:17:29.525 --> 02:17:35.773]  June 4th, we're going into Iran, or if some staged event is going to happen, or maybe it's just a big nothing.
[02:17:36.654 --> 02:17:40.539]  Well, since you raised this, let me give people concrete facts on it when we get back.
[02:17:40.579 --> 02:17:41.060]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:45.643 --> 02:17:48.906]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:17:48.966 --> 02:17:53.150]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:17:53.390 --> 02:17:56.192]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:17:56.372 --> 02:17:58.774]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:17:58.955 --> 02:18:07.622]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:18:07.802 --> 02:18:09.163]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:18:09.343 --> 02:18:13.507]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:18:13.847 --> 02:18:14.348]  We're good to go.
[02:18:45.248 --> 02:18:46.909]  Been a while since you've seen the dentist?
[02:18:47.129 --> 02:18:47.969]  Kidney braces?
[02:18:48.169 --> 02:18:49.410]  Can't afford dental care?

[02:19:44.901 --> 02:19:45.881]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:19:45.961 --> 02:19:50.742]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:19:50.902 --> 02:19:58.704]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:19:58.964 --> 02:20:04.345]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:20:04.545 --> 02:20:11.527]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:20:11.827 --> 02:20:17.170]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:20:17.430 --> 02:20:22.152]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:20:22.513 --> 02:20:30.117]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:20:30.457 --> 02:20:35.920]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:39.881]  For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:39.941 --> 02:20:43.122]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.403 --> 02:20:46.544]  All water isn't the same.
[02:20:46.824 --> 02:20:51.806]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[02:20:52.066 --> 02:20:54.687]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[02:20:54.887 --> 02:21:03.410]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[02:21:03.790 --> 02:21:12.235]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[02:21:12.355 --> 02:21:15.817]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[02:21:16.057 --> 02:21:23.501]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.

[02:21:25.842 --> 02:21:27.203]  Don't be fooled by imitators.
[02:21:27.303 --> 02:21:32.126]  Visit Aquanorthwest.com to learn more about the benefits of positively charged energy water.
[02:21:32.446 --> 02:21:35.487]  Call 888-7-AQUA-NW.
[02:21:35.647 --> 02:21:39.067]  That's 888-727-8269.
[02:21:39.207 --> 02:21:41.148]  Or visit Aquanorthwest.com.
[02:21:51.790 --> 02:21:58.091]  I'm really glad the last caller brought up numerology.
[02:21:59.652 --> 02:22:01.813]  Why does a secret society run NASA?
[02:22:01.853 --> 02:22:04.494]  Why are there secret societies that run our intelligence agencies?
[02:22:05.814 --> 02:22:07.354]  Why all over the world?
[02:22:07.374 --> 02:22:11.516]  I mean, it's even mainstream admitted news that secret societies run much of our society.
[02:22:11.876 --> 02:22:15.037]  Because they were the precursors of intelligence agencies.
[02:22:16.497 --> 02:22:19.898]  Knowledge, mathematics, science was seen as magical.
[02:22:20.358 --> 02:22:25.179]  It was very powerful because it allowed you to be the top architect who built stuff for the king.
[02:22:26.120 --> 02:22:26.560]  Or for
[02:22:27.853 --> 02:22:30.215]  You know, whatever major public works it was.
[02:22:30.715 --> 02:22:32.077]  So you had to guard that.
[02:22:33.518 --> 02:22:38.101]  And so that's why the religion of the Illuminati, and we even had that professor on from Canada, remember?
[02:22:38.121 --> 02:22:40.043]  It was all over the big Canadian newspapers and TV.
[02:22:40.724 --> 02:22:45.908]  The big state house where the government's all satanic with 666 and all this stuff hidden in plain view.
[02:22:48.290 --> 02:22:50.371]  Because to them, that's their religion.
[02:22:50.592 --> 02:22:52.213]  That that's what they're into, is numbers.
[02:22:52.233 --> 02:22:54.535]  And they believe that numbers have power.
[02:22:56.002 --> 02:23:02.246]  And you've got the obvious stuff like the Madrid bombing on 3-11, 911 days after 9-11, but there's even more obvious stuff.
[02:23:02.726 --> 02:23:06.609]  We have the Illuminati Secret Language section on InfoWars.com.
[02:23:08.490 --> 02:23:17.636]  And they have stuff like, on the one year anniversary of 9-11, the New York Lottery, not the Texas, not the Illinois, the New York Lottery came up 9-1-1.
[02:23:20.876 --> 02:23:28.701]  The Chicago Mercantile, that same day, had never come up 9-1-1, much less with zeros behind it, came up 9-1-1-point-0-0-0-0.
[02:23:30.061 --> 02:23:34.524]  And the Associated Press said that that was like 1 out of 14 plus billion.
[02:23:35.244 --> 02:23:36.965]  So those two things happened that same day.
[02:23:38.626 --> 02:23:40.267]  Showing how controlled all of this is.
[02:23:40.547 --> 02:23:41.488]  And they do control us.
[02:23:42.729 --> 02:23:45.950]  The stocks, the mercantiles, it's all completely staged, folks.
[02:23:46.271 --> 02:23:46.851]  And that's come out.
[02:23:48.280 --> 02:23:54.724]  So this is how they flaunt, and this is their own little bragging rights, when they do this.
[02:23:55.364 --> 02:24:00.067]  Like a psychopath likes to leave his symbol, or his sign, or his calling card.
[02:24:00.727 --> 02:24:10.813]  I mean, I got the Old Time Magazine article from the 80's, and it was admitted to the minute of the speeches that Reagan gave, to the days he gave them, to where he gave them.
[02:24:11.113 --> 02:24:13.935]  It was all according to their astrologer.
[02:24:14.495 --> 02:24:17.477]  And it was more than just an astrologer, their occult advisor.
[02:24:18.234 --> 02:24:23.938]  I mean, the Western world's decisions being made according to an astrologer.
[02:24:24.679 --> 02:24:26.060]  They really believe this.
[02:24:26.300 --> 02:24:26.720]  I don't.
[02:24:28.201 --> 02:24:28.722]  They do.
[02:24:29.983 --> 02:24:31.504]  And you'd be amazed.
[02:24:32.425 --> 02:24:33.605]  You'd be shocked.
[02:24:34.266 --> 02:24:43.753]  You'd be blown away by just how many of the decisions that are made in our daily lives
[02:24:45.434 --> 02:24:46.454]  are in conjunction with this.
[02:24:46.514 --> 02:24:48.155]  I mean, look at the corporate symbols.
[02:24:48.715 --> 02:24:54.016]  Pyramids, triple sixes, gods, all seeing eyes.
[02:24:54.816 --> 02:24:55.776]  Almost all of them.
[02:24:57.756 --> 02:24:58.636]  Almost all of them.
[02:24:59.236 --> 02:25:01.857]  They believe they get power out of these symbols.
[02:25:01.877 --> 02:25:04.737]  They believe these symbols radiate power.
[02:25:08.518 --> 02:25:10.018]  And they're obsessed with it.
[02:25:10.058 --> 02:25:11.679]  I mean, they do rituals at Skull and Bones.
[02:25:11.699 --> 02:25:13.079]  They do rituals at Bohemian Grove.
[02:25:13.139 --> 02:25:13.839]  It's admitted.
[02:25:14.962 --> 02:25:17.563]  Tony Blair goes and has these weird rituals.
[02:25:17.583 --> 02:25:20.084]  He had one at an Aztec temple in secret.
[02:25:20.424 --> 02:25:21.705]  That came out in the BBC.
[02:25:22.445 --> 02:25:23.665]  He does other rituals.
[02:25:24.386 --> 02:25:28.007]  He makes decisions according to channeling the spirit of light.
[02:25:28.387 --> 02:25:29.548]  What's with the London Telegraph?
[02:25:29.608 --> 02:25:31.769]  I mean, they're a bunch of lunatics!
[02:25:34.129 --> 02:25:35.390]  Very superstitious.
[02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:37.131]  Very obsessed with this stuff.
[02:25:38.591 --> 02:25:39.291]  And it's real!
[02:25:40.372 --> 02:25:43.253]  Now, there's two ways to look at Hollywood and television.
[02:25:43.872 --> 02:25:46.613]  Either people are trying to warn us inside Hollywood.
[02:25:48.734 --> 02:25:51.395]  That is the case some of the time.
[02:25:52.656 --> 02:25:55.417]  But a lot of the time they're just flaunting it and conditioning us.
[02:25:56.157 --> 02:26:01.539]  You know, when you see every episode of 24 and they're torturing people to get answers and torture's good, you're being conditioned.
[02:26:03.220 --> 02:26:12.624]  But then you've got stuff like the show Lone Gunman that aired after the X-Files for a year with a lot of the X-Files stars.
[02:26:14.508 --> 02:26:15.828]  We've had Dean Haglin on this show.
[02:26:15.868 --> 02:26:18.589]  I had a video interview with him on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:26:18.609 --> 02:26:21.830]  He just called me and said, I'm coming over there to interview you for a film I'm making.
[02:26:22.330 --> 02:26:38.315]  And he gets to my house and on tape he goes, oh yeah, by the way, I wanted to tell you, Alex, that we got approached by the CIA a lot to put stuff in our plots and this thing of flying the jets in the buildings, that may have come from them.
[02:26:38.495 --> 02:26:39.135]  That's all I'm going to say.
[02:26:40.327 --> 02:26:46.512]  I mean, they have a show where a secret government group wants to fly a jet into a building by remote control as a pretext for war.
[02:26:48.153 --> 02:26:49.434]  And they air this months before 9-11.
[02:26:49.454 --> 02:26:54.357]  They have a long kiss goodnight where they admit a real bombing.
[02:26:54.377 --> 02:26:56.839]  The Feds did bomb the World Trade Center in 93.
[02:26:57.520 --> 02:27:04.305]  And they admit that in the movie and then say they're going to blow it up again, but totally, to get war funding and to get contracts.
[02:27:06.747 --> 02:27:16.890]  But then in the real world, and there's about 10 other examples of this, in the real world though, we have PNAC with Dick Cheney saying we need helpful Pearl Harbor events to get the people behind our war.
[02:27:16.930 --> 02:27:21.592]  We got Virginia Brzezinski, Grand Chess Board, co-founder Trilateral Commission in 97 saying it.
[02:27:22.052 --> 02:27:30.755]  We need to have helpful terror attacks on the order of Pearl Harbor as a pretext to get the slaves, they call us slaves, behind a war.
[02:27:31.535 --> 02:27:32.936]  They call us slaves.
[02:27:36.011 --> 02:27:39.036]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.938 --> 02:27:42.622]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.047 --> 02:27:53.512]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:53.952 --> 02:27:58.196]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:58.416 --> 02:28:05.463]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.843 --> 02:28:11.949]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.089 --> 02:28:13.290]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:13.630 --> 02:28:16.594]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:16.734 --> 02:28:17.635]  Eliminate the cost.
[02:28:17.715 --> 02:28:18.736]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:19.077 --> 02:28:26.325]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:26.606 --> 02:28:30.030]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:28:30.410 --> 02:28:35.077]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[02:28:45.521 --> 02:28:51.764]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.904 --> 02:28:58.067]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.347 --> 02:29:06.791]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.032 --> 02:29:14.035]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.355 --> 02:29:19.198]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.398 --> 02:29:24.802]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.142 --> 02:29:28.224]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.565 --> 02:29:36.470]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.570 --> 02:29:37.130]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:44.996 --> 02:29:51.099]  Do you have $10, $20, $30,000 or more in credit card debt that's suffocating your bank account and your lifestyle?
[02:29:51.240 --> 02:29:56.163]  If you think bankruptcy is the only way out, then pay close attention because relief is on the way!

[02:30:06.289 --> 02:30:10.713]  Debt Relief USA has been helping people just like you regain control of their financial future.
[02:30:10.854 --> 02:30:13.937]  In most cases, you can be debt free in less than 36 months.
[02:30:14.217 --> 02:30:17.880]  I owed so much on my credit cards, I could barely make the minimum monthly payment.
[02:30:18.000 --> 02:30:20.963]  We talked about filing bankruptcy, but I was concerned about my credit.
[02:30:21.164 --> 02:30:23.165]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.
[02:30:23.366 --> 02:30:27.009]  They set up a plan for me, where I could settle for just 40% of what I owed.
[02:30:27.249 --> 02:30:30.853]  I'm back in control of my life, and I owe it all to Debt Relief USA.
[02:30:31.013 --> 02:30:34.295]  Call Debt Relief USA today for your free consultation.
[02:30:34.315 --> 02:30:34.395]  800-509-3201.

[02:30:35.795 --> 02:30:36.055]  Call now.
[02:30:36.075 --> 02:30:36.115]  800-509-3201.
[02:30:36.135 --> 02:30:36.176]  800-509-3201.
[02:30:36.196 --> 02:30:36.516]  All right.
[02:30:36.536 --> 02:30:37.796]  I'm going to try to get to Moe and Mike.
[02:30:37.836 --> 02:30:38.497]  Moe in Texas, Arizona.
[02:31:01.349 --> 02:31:03.410]  Mike in Arizona, not Arizona in Mike.
[02:31:04.510 --> 02:31:05.651]  And we got Paul Watson with us.
[02:31:05.671 --> 02:31:10.093]  I got four or five clips I want to play, talking about this numerology, this throwing it in our face.
[02:31:10.713 --> 02:31:12.854]  But really, criminals always love to brag.
[02:31:12.874 --> 02:31:14.734]  That's why they get caught so much throughout history.
[02:31:15.075 --> 02:31:16.275]  It's part of their pleasure.
[02:31:17.255 --> 02:31:19.076]  And there's been this new Doctor Who.
[02:31:20.357 --> 02:31:22.017]  It's a new series on BBC.
[02:31:22.718 --> 02:31:25.759]  And Paul, we're going to go to this last and play these clips.
[02:31:26.259 --> 02:31:28.700]  And the audio's not too good off the BBC, but it's passable.
[02:31:29.060 --> 02:31:30.721]  Just in a nutshell, tell us about this.
[02:31:31.835 --> 02:31:34.537]  Well, I came across it via an email someone sent.
[02:31:34.657 --> 02:31:42.681]  So, I read the BBC episode guide and about ten other episode guides and watched all the clips of this.
[02:31:43.556 --> 02:31:49.720]  And, um, the plot of this episode parallels the true version of 9-11 in several details.
[02:31:50.380 --> 02:31:56.223]  And it's, um, it's basically a satirical tip of the hat to the 9-11 truth movement.
[02:31:56.283 --> 02:31:59.926]  I don't believe it's as sinister as some of the other examples we've got.
[02:32:00.506 --> 02:32:07.490]  But the plot is basically the government stages a UFO crashing into Big Ben, a spaceship.
[02:32:08.010 --> 02:32:09.751]  Which we know is an official U.S.
[02:32:09.771 --> 02:32:10.432]  government plan.
[02:32:10.812 --> 02:32:12.533]  I, uh, report from Iron Mountain.
[02:32:13.413 --> 02:32:15.555]  Outline the eventual agenda to do that.
[02:32:16.256 --> 02:32:31.847]  So they stage this crash into Big Ben, declare martial law, blame it on an enemy alien race, hype up the threat that these aliens can invade with weapons of mass destruction, and then they go to war with them to grab their natural resources.
[02:32:32.267 --> 02:32:41.054]  And within that, within the episode, there are several details which parallel exactly what happened on 9-11 and what the government says happened and what the truth is.
[02:32:42.933 --> 02:32:55.283]  One of which is, after the spaceship crashes into Big Ben, they pull a body from the Thames River, and the government blames the attack on that particular race of aliens, which, while it prepares for war...
[02:32:56.351 --> 02:33:04.435]  So this parallels blaming Muslim hijackers with box cutters on 9-11 and finding the paper passport a few blocks away in New York.
[02:33:04.495 --> 02:33:05.896]  It's planted fake evidence.
[02:33:06.616 --> 02:33:09.878]  And it comes out in the show that the government is planting all this.
[02:33:10.438 --> 02:33:11.119]  I'll continue.
[02:33:11.539 --> 02:33:19.483]  The Doctor Who character later discovers that the body is actually a pig and there's no way that a race of pigs could have had the capability to carry out the attack.
[02:33:20.003 --> 02:33:24.666]  Similar to the fact that there's no way Muslim hijackers could make NORAD stand out
[02:33:25.106 --> 02:33:26.086]  But then it gets really obvious.
[02:33:54.597 --> 02:34:12.470]  Yeah, because then, um, the 45 seconds claim, in the story they claim that they have to go to war with these aliens because they can attack within 45 seconds, is a take-off of Tony Blair's lie that Iraq could launch weapons of mass destruction in 45 minutes.
[02:34:14.173 --> 02:34:18.776]  So, from front to back, all the details parallel the 9-11 story.
[02:34:18.836 --> 02:34:20.917]  And again, to be clear, this is set in the future.
[02:34:20.937 --> 02:34:26.460]  The government carries out a terror attack, blaming it on a planet they want to attack to get their resources.
[02:34:27.101 --> 02:34:35.246]  Well, in the story, the aliens actually infiltrate the highest levels of government and then carry out the attack to launch a war on another alien race.
[02:34:35.986 --> 02:34:43.110]  And for those who don't know, Star Wars, Attack of the Clones, the second episode, adults didn't understand the plot.
[02:34:43.131 --> 02:34:43.711]  They go, well,
[02:34:44.252 --> 02:34:49.300]  Why is the bad guy really working for the Emperor when they're supposedly fighting with each other?
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:54.510]  No, he's out creating terror attacks so the Emperor has an excuse to declare martial law.
[02:34:55.163 --> 02:35:08.092]  And that's what happens in the third episode, is he's able to overthrow the Republic completely by staging a war that was really focused at the Republic itself all along, and the terrorist forces are controlled by the government.
[02:35:08.112 --> 02:35:13.176]  So, same thing with The Incredibles, which is a great animation film that just came out.
[02:35:13.476 --> 02:35:22.983]  This guy wants to save everybody and be basically a dictator, so to be loved as the savior, he carries out a fake terror attack that then he saves everyone from.
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:27.601]  And, uh, then we have the real world, of course, where the government really does this.
[02:35:27.621 --> 02:35:42.744]  But first, let's play the Long Kiss Goodnight from the mid-90s with Samuel L. Jackson, where they talk about the real bombing of the World Trade Center in 93, which really happened, and then expand out on it and talk about how they're going to blow it up, this time for good.
[02:35:43.004 --> 02:35:44.044]  Let's go ahead and play that.
[02:35:44.064 --> 02:35:45.325]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:45.345 --> 02:35:45.325]  1993.
[02:35:45.505 --> 02:35:47.285]  World Trade Center bombing.
[02:35:47.325 --> 02:35:47.545]  Remember?
[02:35:54.016 --> 02:35:57.939]  During the trial, one of the bombers claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.
[02:36:01.342 --> 02:36:04.325]  The diplomat who issued the terrorist visa was CIA.
[02:36:05.245 --> 02:36:10.590]  It's not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing, purely to justify a budget increase.
[02:36:11.110 --> 02:36:15.654]  You're telling me that you're gonna fake some terrorist thing just to get some money out of Congress?
[02:36:15.734 --> 02:36:19.937]  Well, unfortunately, Mr. Hennessy, I have no idea how to fake killing 4,000 people.
[02:36:21.439 --> 02:36:22.980]  So we're just gonna have to do it for real.
[02:36:24.707 --> 02:36:27.469]  Well, blame it on the Muslims, naturally.
[02:36:27.629 --> 02:36:28.729]  That I get my funding.
[02:36:29.230 --> 02:36:30.650]  Good night, old girl.
[02:36:32.511 --> 02:36:34.032]  Kennedy, Aldean, Chopper One.
[02:36:36.233 --> 02:36:36.654]  Alright.
[02:36:37.774 --> 02:36:39.075]  So, that's that piece.
[02:36:39.135 --> 02:36:40.396]  Now, this piece is a couple minutes long.
[02:36:40.416 --> 02:36:42.137]  We gotta hurry here, because I'm gonna go to some calls, too.
[02:36:42.517 --> 02:36:48.100]  This next piece is a compilation from the lone gunman, where he's talking to the government official.
[02:36:48.160 --> 02:36:49.420]  Well, why is this gonna happen?
[02:36:49.601 --> 02:36:50.221]  It's his father.
[02:36:50.894 --> 02:36:52.736]  And he says, well, it's a terrorist group.
[02:36:52.776 --> 02:36:53.536]  It's our own government.
[02:36:53.556 --> 02:36:58.921]  They want to blame it on, you know, these tin horn dictators who smart bomb them.
[02:36:59.241 --> 02:37:01.643]  They're going to hijack a jet and fly to the World Trade Center.
[02:37:02.083 --> 02:37:05.306]  And then it cuts, of course, to them in the plane and all this comes out.
[02:37:05.806 --> 02:37:07.127]  This came out months before 9-11.
[02:37:08.088 --> 02:37:09.949]  Now I've talked to people involved in writing it.
[02:37:10.290 --> 02:37:12.772]  They believe the CIA planted this story on them.
[02:37:13.152 --> 02:37:14.873]  Let's go ahead and roll it.
[02:37:15.934 --> 02:37:18.436]  We know it's a war game scenario.
[02:37:18.516 --> 02:37:20.478]  It has to do with airline counterterrorism.
[02:37:21.977 --> 02:37:23.338]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[02:37:24.118 --> 02:37:25.459]  Because it's no longer a game.
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:33.584]  If some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassination?
[02:37:33.964 --> 02:37:35.605]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[02:37:37.726 --> 02:37:39.307]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[02:37:41.808 --> 02:37:45.410]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic area?
[02:37:45.430 --> 02:37:45.831]  There you go!
[02:37:45.851 --> 02:37:47.992]  Indicting the entire government, as usual.
[02:37:48.632 --> 02:37:49.112]  A faction.
[02:37:49.493 --> 02:37:50.533]  A small faction.
[02:37:50.553 --> 02:37:51.634]  For what possible gain?
[02:37:52.728 --> 02:37:54.229]  The Cold War's over, John.
[02:37:54.910 --> 02:37:58.012]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market's flat.
[02:37:58.612 --> 02:38:10.660]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility and begging to be smart-bombed.
[02:38:11.161 --> 02:38:11.981]  I can't believe it.
[02:38:12.021 --> 02:38:13.582]  This is about increasing arms sales.
[02:38:16.384 --> 02:38:16.624]  When?
[02:38:17.525 --> 02:38:17.905]  Tonight.
[02:38:19.486 --> 02:38:20.307]  How are you going to stop them?
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:23.221]  That's what it looks like.
[02:38:23.541 --> 02:38:23.761]  What?
[02:38:23.781 --> 02:38:23.941]  Freak!
[02:38:24.201 --> 02:38:25.482]  Load a protocol!
[02:38:25.602 --> 02:38:26.302]  Remote access!
[02:38:26.342 --> 02:38:29.924]  Somebody on the ground's flying your plane!
[02:38:29.984 --> 02:38:31.564]  Loading, sir.
[02:38:31.584 --> 02:38:33.405]  Keep your course.
[02:38:33.565 --> 02:38:36.406]  I'm looking over flight plan.
[02:38:36.666 --> 02:38:39.608]  I'm mapping the data now.
[02:38:51.947 --> 02:38:53.168]  Liars.
[02:38:53.208 --> 02:38:59.711]  Your flight's gonna make an unscheduled stop in exactly 22 minutes.
[02:38:59.771 --> 02:39:02.373]  Border of Liberty and Washington.
[02:39:02.393 --> 02:39:03.273]  Lower Manhattan.
[02:39:03.333 --> 02:39:04.314]  World Trade Center.
[02:39:04.394 --> 02:39:08.016]  I'm gonna crash the plane into the World Trade Center.
[02:39:08.236 --> 02:39:10.617]  I'll tell the flight crew.
[02:39:10.837 --> 02:39:11.778]  Alright, that's it.
[02:39:18.482 --> 02:39:20.646]  And then it goes on, they're able to remote control and stop it.
[02:39:20.946 --> 02:39:25.253]  Now notice, the terror attack is going to be covered by a war game scenario.
[02:39:25.313 --> 02:39:32.425]  That way, when the globalists are doing it, if they get caught by another agency, oh, this was just a drill, we're not really planning to attack it.
[02:39:33.067 --> 02:39:40.172]  And then in the real world, months later on 9-11, they're running a drill with these Arabs who had visas given to them by the U.S.
[02:39:40.212 --> 02:39:41.193]  government, trained at U.S.
[02:39:41.233 --> 02:39:41.593]  bases.
[02:39:41.933 --> 02:39:43.435]  They were agents being well-paid.
[02:39:43.815 --> 02:39:47.678]  They'd been doing it for months before on the planes, testing airport security.
[02:39:47.718 --> 02:39:50.540]  They got on board that day thinking it was part of a drill.
[02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:54.463]  They tested leaving Korans at Topless Bar saying they were going to do it.
[02:39:54.843 --> 02:39:56.324]  They thought they were testing security.
[02:39:56.804 --> 02:39:57.445]  Well, exactly.
[02:39:57.465 --> 02:39:59.587]  I mean, as you said, you talked to Dean Hagland on camera.
[02:40:18.797 --> 02:40:28.705]  Who said that by the time the X-Files was winding down, the producer Chris Cart was being approached by NASA and government agencies with ideas for scripts.
[02:40:29.606 --> 02:40:32.308]  So, I mean, you can look at it as a clear warning.
[02:40:33.089 --> 02:40:40.395]  Some of it is laughing in our faces, some of it is just a reflection of pop culture, and I think that example is a clear warning.
[02:40:40.415 --> 02:40:43.757]  And then you've got things like 24, where the, um,
[02:40:46.187 --> 02:40:53.735]  Nuke gets set off in Los Angeles and the oil conglomerates and people who have infiltrated the highest level of government are behind it.
[02:40:54.275 --> 02:41:02.543]  Now that example is probably one of laughing in our faces because we know that torture propaganda is filtered through shows like 24.
[02:41:03.484 --> 02:41:08.890]  So with those kind of examples it's got a more sinister connection especially when you factor in
[02:41:09.585 --> 02:41:13.727]  Hollywood, who has clear links with Homeland Security and the military.
[02:41:14.548 --> 02:41:26.534]  The recent story was in USA Today, where Homeland Security were giving script advice, and the military were also, in return for using Air Force bases and so forth.
[02:41:26.594 --> 02:41:28.435]  I mean, that's been going on for decades.
[02:41:30.996 --> 02:41:36.520]  On the other angle, with the Doctor Who example, it's more a tip of the hat to popular culture.
[02:41:36.860 --> 02:41:38.362]  Let's play those clips.
[02:41:38.402 --> 02:41:40.223]  This audio isn't the best, folks, so bear with us.
[02:41:40.964 --> 02:41:46.668]  But here's the trailer for this Doctor Who episode where the government's carrying out the attacks themselves.
[02:41:46.688 --> 02:41:47.048]  Here it is.
[02:41:56.152 --> 02:41:59.995]  Big Ben destroyed as a UFO crash lands in central London.
[02:42:01.817 --> 02:42:07.402]  What is it in the name, baby?
[02:42:07.522 --> 02:42:10.685]  Funny way to end a day, putting the world on red alert.
[02:42:10.945 --> 02:42:13.727]  By God, I'll put this country under martial law if I have to!
[02:42:13.987 --> 02:42:14.888]  Come on!
[02:42:29.309 --> 02:42:30.830]  All right, that's part of the trailer.
[02:42:30.850 --> 02:42:32.331]  Now, what are these next clips, Paul?
[02:42:33.432 --> 02:42:34.313]  We don't have all of them.
[02:42:34.333 --> 02:42:42.839]  We don't have time to play all of them, but... One of them is a BBC news reporter, a real news reporter, so they enlisted real news reporters talking about it.
[02:42:43.279 --> 02:42:51.985]  Then the second one is a mock American news report where they talk about the 45 seconds claim and how the UN backs them up on the war.
[02:42:52.005 --> 02:42:54.107]  All right, let's play both those clips.
[02:42:54.147 --> 02:42:54.447]  Go ahead.
[02:42:55.549 --> 02:43:00.352]  Flying objects came down in central London, destroying Big Ben before crashing into the Thames.
[02:43:00.752 --> 02:43:06.416]  Number 10 has so far made no comment about what could be mankind's first contact with alien life.
[02:43:06.776 --> 02:43:11.480]  Traffic's ground to a halt in central London as crowds watch the army investigate the crash site.
[02:43:11.500 --> 02:43:13.541]  Tom Hutchinson was at the scene.
[02:43:13.921 --> 02:43:20.866]  The police urge the public not to panic, with the helpline at the horn screen right now if you're worried about friends or family.
[02:43:21.486 --> 02:43:24.208]  The army is sending divers into the wreck of the spaceship.
[02:43:24.978 --> 02:43:33.964]  No one knows what they're going to find.
[02:43:34.164 --> 02:43:35.345]  They found a body.
[02:43:35.365 --> 02:43:39.047]  It's undetermined, but I'm being told that a body has been found in the wreckage.
[02:43:39.587 --> 02:43:42.009]  A body of non-terrestrial origins.
[02:43:42.989 --> 02:43:43.930]  It's been brought ashore.
[02:43:49.306 --> 02:43:51.729]  We still don't know whether it's alive or dead.
[02:43:51.809 --> 02:43:53.510]  Whitehall is denying everything.
[02:43:54.131 --> 02:43:55.472]  But the body has been brought here.
[02:43:55.893 --> 02:43:56.894]  Albion Hospital.
[02:43:56.914 --> 02:43:57.714]  The road's closed off.
[02:43:57.735 --> 02:43:58.916]  It's the closest to the river.
[02:43:58.936 --> 02:44:04.201]  I'm being told that General Ashcroft is now entering the hospital.
[02:44:10.425 --> 02:44:11.546]  Alright, that's enough of that clip.
[02:44:12.026 --> 02:44:14.428]  It goes on and on, and it's just the body of a pig.
[02:44:14.728 --> 02:44:20.853]  And it's this imaginary group that's attacked, and now they've got to go attack this other planet because it's their fault, but it's really the government.
[02:44:21.453 --> 02:44:24.475]  The next clip, let's go ahead and roll that last clip, because I want to go to some calls.
[02:44:24.896 --> 02:44:25.136]  Go ahead.
[02:44:25.176 --> 02:44:26.457]  Good night here in New York.
[02:44:26.957 --> 02:44:28.318]  The United Nations has gathered.
[02:44:28.859 --> 02:44:34.183]  England has provided them with absolute proof that the massive weapons of destruction do exist.
[02:44:35.103 --> 02:44:38.286]  The Security Council will be making a resolution in a matter of minutes.
[02:44:38.666 --> 02:44:40.127]  And once the codes are released,
[02:44:41.325 --> 02:44:44.488]  Humanity's first interplanetary war begins.
[02:44:46.090 --> 02:44:47.211]  The council is voting.
[02:44:47.591 --> 02:44:49.693]  The results should be known any second now.
[02:44:52.156 --> 02:44:52.857]  The vote is in.
[02:44:53.057 --> 02:44:54.738]  The council says yes.
[02:44:55.499 --> 02:44:57.041]  They are releasing the code.
[02:44:59.986 --> 02:45:03.729]  Well, I tell you, Paul, in our face yet again, and it's everywhere.
[02:45:03.749 --> 02:45:10.294]  They have to respond to this because everybody's waking up to it, so they try to, I guess, give us a nod in some, or in others, propagandize us.
[02:45:10.915 --> 02:45:12.156]  I don't know, it's all out of control.
[02:45:12.176 --> 02:45:22.704]  Well, I mean, you could look at it positively and say that the truth behind 9-11, the truth movement, is so ingrained within the collective unconscious, if you like, that
[02:45:23.248 --> 02:45:37.593]  You know, it's the foundation of major drama productions, so it shows how far-reaching and deep our efforts have been to reach people, that people are taking notice, scriptwriters and so forth, and, you know, making it the basis of drama productions.
[02:45:38.573 --> 02:45:39.174]  Absolutely.
[02:45:39.214 --> 02:45:41.954]  Let's take some calls here and then get more into this.
[02:45:42.735 --> 02:45:44.135]  I've just got time to take two calls.
[02:45:44.335 --> 02:45:46.136]  Mo in Texas, then Mike in Arizona.
[02:45:46.156 --> 02:45:46.716]  Mo, welcome.
[02:45:47.296 --> 02:45:47.917]  Hey there, buddy.
[02:45:47.997 --> 02:45:50.757]  Just something you referred to as revelation of the method.
[02:45:52.751 --> 02:46:02.875]  Independence Day is, there's good evidence for an alien invasion being a good galvanizing thing to usher in world government.
[02:46:02.895 --> 02:46:06.716]  No, Paul Watson's final chapter of Order Out of Chaos covers that.
[02:46:07.577 --> 02:46:07.797]  Yeah.
[02:46:09.437 --> 02:46:12.059]  Grandfather, he's a small town doctor, good people.
[02:46:12.099 --> 02:46:15.481]  He asked me ultimately what I thought of the Bible, and I said, well, a lot of things.
[02:46:15.561 --> 02:46:25.848]  But I guarantee you, if a spaceship comes out of the sky and an image of Jesus comes out of it, and then it changes into Buddha, and then it changes into the Virgin Mary, and then into Vishnu, don't believe it.
[02:46:27.734 --> 02:46:30.414]  The enigmatic they have the technology to do that.
[02:46:30.575 --> 02:46:33.655]  Oh, that's admitted that they, that came out in the first Gulf War.
[02:46:33.695 --> 02:46:44.417]  They have these big, you know, like three big C-130s or DC-10s and they all project together the hologram of a 300 to 900 foot tall Jesus or Buddha or Allah.
[02:46:44.857 --> 02:46:46.237]  The government admits they have that.
[02:46:47.197 --> 02:46:50.298]  Something weird on the numerological weirdness.
[02:46:51.878 --> 02:46:55.259]  We're always encouraging ourselves and each other to
[02:46:57.250 --> 02:47:12.496]  The challenge are belief systems and since my name is Moses, I can go ahead and say, you know, isn't it weird that if you just put some horns on Jesus, wow, he kind of looks like the devil.
[02:47:12.776 --> 02:47:18.258]  And if you just take the horns off the devil, there's that traditional painting of Jesus.
[02:47:18.939 --> 02:47:22.040]  Well, I think that's the devil trying to be the counterfeit, but thank you for the call, Mo.
[02:47:23.921 --> 02:47:24.561]  Look, folks.
[02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:26.561]  Here's another example.
[02:47:26.581 --> 02:47:27.561]  9-1-1.
[02:47:27.861 --> 02:47:30.643]  That's the number we've been taught to love the government.
[02:47:31.343 --> 02:47:32.464]  Call the government.
[02:47:32.524 --> 02:47:33.405]  They're going to save you.
[02:47:33.425 --> 02:47:34.245]  9-1-1.
[02:47:34.265 --> 02:47:35.045]  9-1-1.
[02:47:35.446 --> 02:47:37.527]  The Tattletail number is 3-1-1.
[02:47:39.428 --> 02:47:40.689]  They're out of control, folks.
[02:47:41.629 --> 02:47:43.851]  Let's talk to Mike in Arizona.
[02:47:43.891 --> 02:47:44.371]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:46.721]  Yes, good afternoon Alex and Paul.
[02:47:47.122 --> 02:47:47.642]  Hello.
[02:47:47.782 --> 02:47:51.004]  I have two examples about this in-your-face numerology thing.
[02:47:51.285 --> 02:48:00.632]  When Condoleezza Rice was testifying before the 9-11 Commission, she kept saying something about George Bush had only been in office for 232 days.
[02:48:00.692 --> 02:48:02.073]  She said it like five times.
[02:48:02.953 --> 02:48:06.436]  And 322 is the number for skull and bone.
[02:48:07.985 --> 02:48:09.946]  I know, Condoleezza Roe, I mean all of them.
[02:48:10.686 --> 02:48:13.387]  They started the ceremony to swear them in five minutes early.
[02:48:13.707 --> 02:48:15.748]  Which is Skull and Bones goes five minutes early.
[02:48:15.908 --> 02:48:18.790]  That's why all the photos of Skull and Bones, there's that grandfather clock.
[02:48:19.070 --> 02:48:21.431]  And they give each initiate a grandfather clock.
[02:48:21.971 --> 02:48:22.391]  Stay there.
[02:48:22.491 --> 02:48:24.612]  Paul Watson will comment on that on the other side.
[02:48:26.005 --> 02:48:29.267]  We'll also tell you about some of the new things we've been adding to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:48:29.307 --> 02:48:38.033]  We've got my speech, some of Jimmy Vaughn, at the Toons Not Tolls for free play for everybody on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:48:38.433 --> 02:48:42.796]  So check that video out, our new Arnold Exposed ads, the one I did, the winner of the contest.
[02:48:42.956 --> 02:48:44.897]  Well, a lot of cool stuff.
[02:48:45.743 --> 02:48:50.087]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.268 --> 02:48:54.672]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.832 --> 02:48:59.216]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.256 --> 02:49:00.598]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.363 --> 02:49:02.304]  Panama!
[02:49:02.384 --> 02:49:06.607]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.688 --> 02:49:13.613]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.733 --> 02:49:15.795]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.115 --> 02:49:26.484]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.744 --> 02:49:27.705]  If you want to understand

[02:51:40.903 --> 02:51:47.747]  Alright, Paul Watson.
[02:51:54.099 --> 02:52:00.902]  Comments on the point that the caller who's still with us, Mike in Arizona, was raising?
[02:52:02.543 --> 02:52:04.323]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's their secret language.
[02:52:05.884 --> 02:52:08.765]  Just because we might not see anything in it, they obviously do.
[02:52:08.805 --> 02:52:11.206]  I mean, the Madrid train bombing on 3-11.
[02:52:11.226 --> 02:52:15.628]  You know, Waco, Oklahoma City, 19th of April.
[02:52:16.252 --> 02:52:19.535]  They pick certain dates, and it's all astrological.
[02:52:20.215 --> 02:52:23.918]  They believe that carrying out these events on those dates gives them more power.
[02:52:25.039 --> 02:52:26.681]  You know, a better chance to cover them up.
[02:52:27.441 --> 02:52:29.503]  Well, the space shuttle was on a key day too.
[02:52:29.523 --> 02:52:38.731]  Yeah, because they fail to understand that the basis of astrology revolves around the supposition that the Sun revolves around the Earth.
[02:52:40.012 --> 02:52:43.935]  Which is why I'm not into astrology, but obviously they can look beyond that.
[02:52:45.616 --> 02:52:46.797]  Well, it's what they're into.
[02:52:46.857 --> 02:52:47.757]  Caller, anything else?
[02:52:48.318 --> 02:53:05.706]  Yes, one other thing, you mentioned this show 24, and the star character on there is Jack Bauer, and I was reading a book the other day called Pawns in the Game, and it reveals that the Rothschild, before they had changed their name to Rothschild, was Bauer.
[02:53:07.707 --> 02:53:08.328]  No, that's true.
[02:53:09.525 --> 02:53:09.705]  Yeah.
[02:53:10.045 --> 02:53:11.547]  So I just wonder if there's some connection.
[02:53:11.607 --> 02:53:13.468]  Is that another one of those in-your-face things?
[02:53:13.849 --> 02:53:15.049]  I don't know, but I know this.
[02:53:15.130 --> 02:53:21.635]  The Chicago Mercantile doesn't come up 9-11.0000 on the one-year anniversary.
[02:53:21.655 --> 02:53:26.339]  I mean, look, they had a Phillips ad that ran on TV a year before 9-11.
[02:53:27.359 --> 02:53:28.720]  Phillips, changing your world.
[02:53:29.001 --> 02:53:31.323]  Where two F-16s bomb the World Trade Center.
[02:53:31.683 --> 02:53:32.844]  I mean, what does that mean?
[02:53:34.045 --> 02:53:35.466]  Phillips, changing your world.
[02:53:36.580 --> 02:53:38.621]  I mean, there's so many other examples.
[02:53:39.062 --> 02:53:42.804]  Tom Clancy did a book about hijacked jets, World Trade Center.
[02:53:43.064 --> 02:53:45.606]  And then Bush says, we never heard of such a plan, thanks for the call.
[02:53:46.066 --> 02:53:48.107]  But, I mean, take that lone gunman episode.
[02:53:48.888 --> 02:53:54.411]  The government's running a drill, but it's a cover to fly the plane into the building to get Mark, you know, to have this takeover.
[02:53:54.691 --> 02:53:55.972]  I mean, Paul, that's pretty obvious.
[02:53:57.093 --> 02:54:01.836]  It is, and I mean, going back to the whole stallion thing, it's in order out of chaos.
[02:54:02.745 --> 02:54:08.507]  They had Steven Spielberg meeting them at the Pentagon, at the Air Force bases.
[02:54:09.087 --> 02:54:13.749]  And six months later, he would come out with films like Deep Impact.
[02:54:14.389 --> 02:54:17.791]  And this is the same Steven Spielberg who attends Bilderberg meetings.
[02:54:18.651 --> 02:54:21.432]  And, you know, everyone says that Bilderberg has no power.
[02:54:21.452 --> 02:54:23.593]  And that it's just a talking shop.
[02:54:23.673 --> 02:54:29.095]  Well, I mean, why are Hollywood's top producers there when it's supposed to be a political meeting?
[02:54:29.115 --> 02:54:30.796]  What's up, New, over at PrisonPlanet.tv?
[02:54:32.581 --> 02:54:38.086]  Um, we got reports of biometric scanning to join the gym.
[02:54:38.106 --> 02:54:47.073]  Somebody in Rocky River, Ohio said there was a huge line of people at the counter when I went to the scanner to swipe my membership card.
[02:54:47.313 --> 02:54:51.936]  I noticed they were training people in the use of their new security system.
[02:54:52.096 --> 02:54:55.099]  Yeah, tanning salons, grocery stores, it's everywhere.
[02:54:56.365 --> 02:55:01.628]  At PrisonPlanet.tv, folks, we've got all twelve of my films, including Marshall Long.
[02:55:02.128 --> 02:55:03.428]  You can download and burn copies.
[02:55:03.728 --> 02:55:09.031]  We have my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other e-books, dozens of other films been authorized to post.
[02:55:09.791 --> 02:55:13.033]  We have hundreds of audio interviews from the radio show.
[02:55:13.593 --> 02:55:16.494]  Fifteen cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[02:55:17.314 --> 02:55:20.436]  And PrisonPlanet.tv is now a year old, Paul!
[02:55:21.396 --> 02:55:21.916]  That's right.
[02:55:22.417 --> 02:55:25.098]  We continue to add new stuff on a daily basis.
[02:55:26.816 --> 02:55:34.526]  We've got some 9-11 conference footage going up there in early June, which I'm going to, so that'll be exciting for people to see.
[02:55:35.167 --> 02:55:36.609]  So it continues to expand.
[02:55:38.368 --> 02:55:39.789]  Absolutely, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:39.809 --> 02:55:41.390]  My weekly TV report is everything.

[02:56:07.914 --> 02:56:10.455]  Paul Watson, I want to thank you for joining us today.
[02:56:11.276 --> 02:56:19.059]  And I'm told you're going to take a compilation of all these different clips we've got about throwing it in our face with the symbolism and put it on one page for us?
[02:56:19.579 --> 02:56:21.580]  That's right, that'll be up over the weekend.
[02:56:22.240 --> 02:56:23.821]  Alright, have a good weekend, my friend.
[02:56:24.061 --> 02:56:24.621]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:24.842 --> 02:56:25.322]  Take care.

[02:56:28.703 --> 02:56:30.244]  Back on Monday, 11 to 2 Central.
