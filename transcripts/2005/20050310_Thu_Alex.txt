[00:00:05.681 --> 00:00:06.322]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.044]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.765 --> 00:00:09.886]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.527 --> 00:00:11.348]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.109 --> 00:00:13.030]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.671 --> 00:00:17.416]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:21.941]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:32.413]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the day of March 2005.
[00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:34.714]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:36.995]  The website's freshly updated for you daily.
[00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:41.236]  Infowars.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:00:42.337 --> 00:00:51.020]  Ohio Senate ready to pass anti-terror bill that will block their state municipalities from...
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.441]  Going against the Unpatriot Act.
[00:00:54.741 --> 00:00:56.301]  We'll be talking about that.
[00:00:57.582 --> 00:00:58.722]  Got an article here.
[00:00:59.042 --> 00:01:02.023]  Sweating in an airport, you could be a terrorist.
[00:01:02.583 --> 00:01:04.624]  This from Reuters, major sign of it.
[00:01:04.684 --> 00:01:08.565]  And man tasered in hospital bed, forced to give urine sample.
[00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:16.367]  He was restrained, tied down on the bed, refused to urinate for them, and so they began torturing him.
[00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:20.548]  See, the torture's already been widespread for a long time in America.
[00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:27.513]  And with all the cop dramas and CIA dramas on TV, it's going to get more and more prevalent.
[00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:41.602]  In fact, a few weeks ago I put on the website a video from the mid-90s where peaceful pro-life demonstrators are sitting on the sidewalk and refuse to get in paddy wagons so they break their arms with nunchucks.
[00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:47.826]  Savagely twist them, breaking them, compound fractures, bones sticking out of flesh.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.603]  Women having miscarriages, they're being so savagely beaten by police, and the cops are on record going, yeah, we're allowed to do this.
[00:01:58.064 --> 00:01:59.744]  So forget Abu Ghraib.
[00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:02.105]  This is going on right here in America.
[00:02:02.145 --> 00:02:07.367]  You don't need to go to Cuba and Camp X-Ray to see that happening, and here it is right out in the open, yeah.
[00:02:08.567 --> 00:02:12.609]  He was tied down in a hospital bed and said he couldn't urinate, so we started tasering him.
[00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:15.090]  So that's the new freedom.
[00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:17.760]  Don't answer our questions, we're going to taser you.
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:19.902]  And it's not torture, it's love.
[00:02:20.702 --> 00:02:23.665]  You know, forced psychological testing, forced drugging is new freedom.
[00:02:24.485 --> 00:02:25.526]  Torture is new freedom.
[00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:27.407]  Getting rid of the borders is new freedom.
[00:02:28.588 --> 00:02:34.812]  The average Texan will be paying, what, $3,800 plus a year to drive their car.
[00:02:34.832 --> 00:02:36.994]  $1,800 plus per car just here in Austin.
[00:02:37.454 --> 00:02:38.195]  That's new freedom.
[00:02:38.235 --> 00:02:38.995]  It's conservative.
[00:02:41.177 --> 00:02:45.440]  Running male prostitution rings out of the White House is Christian.
[00:02:47.097 --> 00:02:51.420]  And if you're against it, well, you're probably with Al-Qaeda.
[00:02:53.462 --> 00:02:56.364]  So that's just some of what is coming up today.
[00:02:56.384 --> 00:03:03.629]  I will also, and I mean it when I say it, I'm getting better and better about taking a lot of your calls, but I'm not good about cutting the callers off.
[00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:10.806]  I mean, I'll interrupt a few times and add my points, but I give the caller two, three minutes, which is great because you're also interesting and informed.
[00:03:11.306 --> 00:03:18.469]  But if you could just have it down to the cogent points you want to make or the questions or comments, that'd be good so I can get to the next person, which could be you.
[00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:21.230]  And we're going to take a lot of calls today.
[00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.030]  I'm kind of in that mode right now.
[00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.110]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.190]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:43.668]  And as I mentioned earlier, the websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, JournalismReport.com, Infowars.net.
[00:03:44.028 --> 00:03:44.828]  Why so many sites?
[00:03:44.868 --> 00:03:48.390]  Well, different webmasters, all different news and information, different servers.
[00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:50.230]  It's part of the redundancy.
[00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:55.052]  It's more tanks on the field in the information war.
[00:03:56.713 --> 00:04:03.756]  But any issue, any news item you'd like to talk about... You know, I saw that CNN clip again that we had played about a year ago
[00:04:05.544 --> 00:04:11.986]  Over a year ago now, when they captured Saddam, and there's the colonel telling the troops, okay, here's the story.
[00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:14.507]  He was found in a hole.
[00:04:15.447 --> 00:04:17.708]  No one say anything else about what happened.
[00:04:18.288 --> 00:04:19.548]  Alright, that's the story.
[00:04:19.648 --> 00:04:20.808]  Don't say anything.
[00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:27.030]  And now it's admitted that it was all staged, and a Marine's gone public, but it was all over the European papers.
[00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.731]  The Kurds admitted they'd already captured him a month before.
[00:04:30.538 --> 00:04:36.279]  So, the official story is a fraud on that, and it's another Jerry Bruckheimer production.
[00:04:36.339 --> 00:04:37.179]  Remember Private Lynch?
[00:04:37.799 --> 00:04:40.600]  We told you that was totally staged, and then later she admitted it was staged.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.720]  This is serious business.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:55.602]  Another article here where they admit that Homeland Security, that old Homeland, has set up offices in Hollywood, helping them produce the movies and write the scripts.
[00:04:55.622 --> 00:04:57.803]  We already knew that, but now it's in our face.
[00:04:58.123 --> 00:04:59.203]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:05:02.088 --> 00:05:05.009]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:06.970]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:12.913]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:18.456]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.736 --> 00:05:22.858]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:23.038 --> 00:05:26.843]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:27.104 --> 00:05:31.730]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:38.099]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.982]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:42.524]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[00:05:42.605 --> 00:05:45.207]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:45.327 --> 00:05:49.011]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:54.156]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:05:54.257 --> 00:05:56.239]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:05:56.479 --> 00:05:58.000]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:05:58.181 --> 00:06:00.243]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.326 --> 00:06:04.209]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:06:04.549 --> 00:06:07.432]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:13.877]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:06:14.238 --> 00:06:21.564]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:06:21.744 --> 00:06:25.788]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.
[00:06:26.088 --> 00:06:31.610]  Locate billion-dollar disaster-prone areas, the safest cities, ideal solar locations, and much, much more.

[00:07:01.107 --> 00:07:04.210]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.812]  Not likely according to the World Health Organization.
[00:07:07.032 --> 00:07:14.158]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:19.743]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:07:19.983 --> 00:07:27.430]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.731]  Either way, why chance it?

[00:08:05.714 --> 00:08:06.374]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.014 --> 00:08:08.095]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.795 --> 00:08:09.916]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:11.417]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:12.957]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.678 --> 00:08:17.359]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.941]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.696 --> 00:08:36.438]  All right, eight minutes, 35 seconds into this first hour, second segment.
[00:08:36.578 --> 00:08:37.758]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:37.798 --> 00:08:42.961]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday, Sometimes Owns Friday edition.
[00:08:44.641 --> 00:08:47.623]  And let's plunge straight into the news.
[00:08:47.783 --> 00:08:50.204]  Gas is now top $2 a gallon.
[00:08:50.224 --> 00:08:54.466]  That's what AAA is telling its members.
[00:08:55.612 --> 00:09:03.139]  And gasoline futures are to blame, still below record high of $2.05 as the national average.
[00:09:03.199 --> 00:09:08.584]  But in areas of California, you're looking at $2.45 a gallon.
[00:09:08.664 --> 00:09:11.527]  Areas of New York, $2.50 a gallon.
[00:09:12.568 --> 00:09:19.755]  And a few weeks ago, I heard a John Stossel special report on a local radio station, a refeed of it,
[00:09:20.683 --> 00:09:28.531]  From ABC, and he was correct in saying that gas prices are not actually the highest they've ever been.
[00:09:30.132 --> 00:09:35.498]  That if you adjust for inflation, gas prices are actually low.
[00:09:37.499 --> 00:09:40.422]  But there's a problem still with that analysis.
[00:09:41.283 --> 00:09:44.987]  Overall, if you adjust for the true inflation...
[00:09:46.205 --> 00:10:00.093]  Of key staple items that have to be purchased, like fuel and food and housing, people are not making enough money to pay for the increase on average.
[00:10:00.694 --> 00:10:08.518]  And that's why the average American, depending on what government number you look at, are spending about $1.15 to $1.22 for every dollar they actually make.
[00:10:08.538 --> 00:10:10.700]  So on average, everyone is...
[00:10:16.127 --> 00:10:17.929]  Basically plunging into debt.
[00:10:18.949 --> 00:10:23.833]  The majority of people, I shouldn't say everyone, are plunging into debt.
[00:10:24.474 --> 00:10:26.616]  And then you listen to the establishment media.
[00:10:26.636 --> 00:10:28.297]  They'll tell you, oh, there's no inflation.
[00:10:28.938 --> 00:10:29.919]  Everything's great.
[00:10:30.299 --> 00:10:32.821]  And the standard of living is getting higher.
[00:10:33.562 --> 00:10:35.023]  And that is not the case.
[00:10:35.964 --> 00:10:37.465]  It is very serious.
[00:10:38.306 --> 00:10:42.409]  And another reason gas has gone up so much is the dollar has dropped.
[00:10:43.278 --> 00:10:57.005]  Almost 45% in value from three years ago, so it's going to take more dollars to buy from the OPEC nations that have gone on to a Euro benchmark.
[00:10:58.766 --> 00:11:09.831]  So Bush tells you that having a weak dollar is good, and his little buddy Warren Buffett, who runs around worshipping Schwarzenegger, they all act like Buffett and Bush are in some type of fight,
[00:11:10.518 --> 00:11:11.418]  That's not true.
[00:11:11.599 --> 00:11:14.960]  Buffett's over-supporting Schwarzenegger, who's Bush's little darling.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.441]  And Buffett's off betting against the dollar.
[00:11:17.902 --> 00:11:18.902]  And who gets hurt?
[00:11:19.162 --> 00:11:23.304]  The American people get hurt in the process.
[00:11:23.804 --> 00:11:25.205]  Iran reports U.S.
[00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:27.046]  aircraft over nuke sites.
[00:11:28.024 --> 00:11:29.965]  Iran has reported flights by U.S.
[00:11:30.005 --> 00:11:33.848]  military aircraft over nuclear facilities near the borders of Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:11:34.388 --> 00:11:37.370]  Iran's state-controlled media reported flights by U.S.
[00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:43.874]  aircraft over the range of nuclear facilities, including the Bashir nuclear reactor constructed by Russia.
[00:11:44.254 --> 00:11:44.674]  The U.S.
[00:11:44.754 --> 00:11:55.721]  reconnaissance flights were conducted as Iran was said to be accelerating its nuclear weapons programs in facilities unaccessible to the International Atomic Energy Agency.
[00:11:56.381 --> 00:12:02.665]  In late December of 2004, Tehran ordered the Iranian Air Force to shoot down unidentified aircraft flying anywhere in the country.
[00:12:03.185 --> 00:12:08.668]  Iranian officials have accused Israel and the United States of seeking to conduct reconnaissance flights over Iran.
[00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:18.534]  Iran has developed and deployed anti-aircraft missiles around major nuclear sites, including the Bashir reactor.
[00:12:19.055 --> 00:12:22.677]  So far, there have been no reports of Iranian missiles fired toward U.S.
[00:12:23.197 --> 00:12:24.598]  or Israeli warplanes.
[00:12:26.858 --> 00:12:28.420]  So, continual escalation.
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:41.612]  But the government's not worried about China threatening openly this week to invade Taiwan, massing their military forces, about to pass a law authorizing the open invasion of Taiwan.
[00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:47.312]  At the same time, we have Pakistan ordering its troops to kill any U.S.
[00:12:47.352 --> 00:13:00.095]  soldiers coming across the border into the country, accidentally, because the borders are not clearly marked, even with GPS on the border in the frontier regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[00:13:01.276 --> 00:13:01.736]  That's okay.
[00:13:01.756 --> 00:13:10.238]  They're our little buddies, as they have at least ten nuclear missiles, some of which can hit the continental United States, the edges of the United States.
[00:13:11.875 --> 00:13:15.938]  Or shoot over the pole and hit areas like Chicago.
[00:13:16.599 --> 00:13:17.820]  Oh, that's not a problem.
[00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:23.104]  In fact, go ahead and give more nukes to North Korea, Rumsfeld, with the nuke reactors, and let your buddy Pakistan do it.
[00:13:23.584 --> 00:13:24.845]  No, none of that's a problem.
[00:13:25.305 --> 00:13:29.909]  We need to attack Iran, and the inspectors have been all over the country.
[00:13:30.489 --> 00:13:32.891]  The inspectors have been all over the entire region.
[00:13:33.011 --> 00:13:39.516]  Syria is groveling and prostrating itself before the New World Order, and so they're going to get clobbered.
[00:13:42.032 --> 00:13:45.113]  Shifting gears into more media lies, U.S.
[00:13:45.173 --> 00:13:49.995]  knew hostage was coming, Italy's fascista prime minister says.
[00:13:50.636 --> 00:13:58.879]  Italy's prime minister on Wednesday disputed Washington's version of the events leading to the killing of an Italian intelligence agent by U.S.
[00:13:58.899 --> 00:14:07.042]  troops in Baghdad, saying the agent had notified the proper authorities that he was on his way to the airport after winning the release of the hostage.
[00:14:08.483 --> 00:14:09.383]  And now the U.S.
[00:14:09.543 --> 00:14:11.444]  Army admits they have been given the warning,
[00:14:12.438 --> 00:14:15.701]  And this has come out in the Associated Press.
[00:14:15.781 --> 00:14:19.144]  Troops in shooting were for Negroponte.
[00:14:19.624 --> 00:14:22.887]  They were Negroponte's private death squad.
[00:14:22.927 --> 00:14:26.109]  Of course, Negroponte has now been withdrawn to the U.S.
[00:14:26.129 --> 00:14:28.291]  to be the new head of all U.S.
[00:14:28.331 --> 00:14:29.392]  intelligence agencies.
[00:14:29.412 --> 00:14:32.975]  A whole new giant department created, just like Homeland Security.
[00:14:33.335 --> 00:14:34.236]  But he's over it all.
[00:14:34.276 --> 00:14:37.298]  He is the Lord of Darkness, is one of his nicknames.
[00:14:38.883 --> 00:14:41.484]  Literally, that's one of his nicknames, just like Pearl.
[00:14:41.564 --> 00:14:44.025]  Richard Pearl is the Prince of Darkness.
[00:14:44.645 --> 00:14:47.466]  They all have very Christian names, very friendly people.
[00:14:49.246 --> 00:14:53.168]  You might want to listen to people's names, what they're called, but maybe that means they're friendly and nice.
[00:14:54.688 --> 00:14:57.109]  To the Death Squad Commander, who is openly hired...
[00:14:58.018 --> 00:15:05.725]  Hundreds of former top death squad commanders, some of which are being paid $800,000 a year to go to Iraq.
[00:15:05.745 --> 00:15:06.826]  They can't even get enough U.S.
[00:15:06.886 --> 00:15:11.711]  troops to be bloodthirsty and wicked, so they hire the old death squad commanders from Latin America.
[00:15:13.246 --> 00:15:18.890]  We were now just brutally savaging the Iraqi people, part of the freedom and liberation.
[00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:22.852]  But business-associated press troops and shooting were for Negroponte.
[00:15:23.392 --> 00:15:24.733]  Why is that a surprise?
[00:15:25.334 --> 00:15:26.394]  Of course, it is confirmed.
[00:15:26.714 --> 00:15:29.016]  They did cut off their cell phones right before they did it.
[00:15:29.396 --> 00:15:30.117]  This was a hit.
[00:15:30.537 --> 00:15:35.320]  And now they've had Fox News analysts on TV going, well, she didn't deserve to be released.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.861]  Too bad something didn't happen.
[00:15:38.451 --> 00:15:38.731]  U.S.
[00:15:38.791 --> 00:15:49.693]  troops were mistakenly killed an Italian intelligence agent last week, oh, mistakenly, on the road to Baghdad airport, were part of an extra security provided by the U.S.
[00:15:49.813 --> 00:15:50.893]  Army to protect U.S.
[00:15:50.953 --> 00:15:53.574]  Ambassador John Negroponte.
[00:15:53.594 --> 00:15:54.394]  A U.S.
[00:15:54.434 --> 00:16:02.095]  official said today, Italian intelligence agent Nicola Calparri was killed March 4th when U.S.
[00:16:02.115 --> 00:16:06.576]  troops opened fire on a car carrying him, an Italian journalist said.
[00:16:07.614 --> 00:16:10.656]  Who were just been freed from insurgents.
[00:16:10.737 --> 00:16:16.661]  The mobile patrols were there to enhance security because Ambassador Negroponte was expected through.
[00:16:17.202 --> 00:16:17.542]  U.S.
[00:16:17.642 --> 00:16:32.413]  Embassy spokesman Robert Callahan said, confirming reports in the Italian media, the newspaper La Repubblica reported Wednesday that the checkpoint had been set up to protect the passage of Ambassador Negroponte.
[00:16:33.154 --> 00:16:34.675]  Good, Negroponte.
[00:16:35.896 --> 00:16:36.537]  Right.
[00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:39.510]  It's like Lord Vader or something.
[00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:52.133]  It was not known if Negroponte, who was nominated last month by Lord Bush to be the new Director of National Intelligence, and he's now back here, has already passed through the checkpoint.
[00:16:52.553 --> 00:16:54.814]  The shooting took place at about 8.55 p.m.
[00:16:54.854 --> 00:16:57.334]  when two hours before Baghdad's 11 p.m.
[00:16:57.354 --> 00:16:57.734]  curfew.
[00:16:58.494 --> 00:17:05.456]  And, you know, the cavalier way that the pundits on TV just talk about, oh, we kill a lot of innocent people, it's just war.
[00:17:06.442 --> 00:17:08.483]  You know, breaking eggs here.
[00:17:10.644 --> 00:17:19.307]  I remember during the liberation of Baghdad, it was just live on TV, the footage, the tanks rolling, and there'd be buses and cars driving, and they just opened fire on them.
[00:17:19.327 --> 00:17:26.010]  You know, the cars blowing up, dead people falling out, children's dead bodies on fire on the ground.
[00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:27.431]  I mean, all the photos of it.
[00:17:29.872 --> 00:17:32.413]  And people cheering, just shooting anything that moves.
[00:17:33.393 --> 00:17:35.454]  Now, let's just go into a city of five million people,
[00:17:36.383 --> 00:17:37.804]  And, you know, there's no resistance.
[00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:41.266]  They paid off all the Republican Guard leaders and two of the three Army groups.
[00:17:41.306 --> 00:17:42.206]  They were all flown out.
[00:17:42.746 --> 00:17:45.668]  All the generals out to safety, paid in euros, gold, and dollars.
[00:17:45.708 --> 00:17:46.248]  That's admitted.
[00:17:47.069 --> 00:17:52.452]  And so we've got to have some type of fake war, so let's roll the troops in and start slaughtering everyone.
[00:17:52.992 --> 00:17:54.513]  And that's liberation, folks.
[00:17:57.114 --> 00:17:58.375]  Absolute liberation.
[00:17:58.395 --> 00:18:04.098]  And now, what is it, 50,000 Iraqis have died since the war began, a million and a half, a cool mil and a half,
[00:18:04.910 --> 00:18:07.691]  Since the 13 years of sanctions.
[00:18:10.711 --> 00:18:13.592]  Some of the other news here that I want to go over.
[00:18:13.772 --> 00:18:15.032]  Sweating in an airport?
[00:18:15.512 --> 00:18:16.752]  You could be a terrorist.
[00:18:16.772 --> 00:18:17.572]  This is from Reuters.
[00:18:18.792 --> 00:18:24.613]  Of course, they put in five airports the passive MRIs that scan your brain.
[00:18:24.813 --> 00:18:26.254]  That's CBS News, by the way.
[00:18:26.274 --> 00:18:27.794]  That was two and a half years ago.
[00:18:28.474 --> 00:18:31.195]  And if you're upset, they go ahead and question you.
[00:18:32.275 --> 00:18:33.455]  NASA helped develop it.
[00:18:34.822 --> 00:18:35.863]  I'm not joking, folks.
[00:18:36.383 --> 00:18:55.079]  Well, the new thing is, if you're sweating, boy, I can tell you, how many times have I been carrying my luggage from the parking garage into an airport, especially here in Texas where it's 110 degrees in the summer, and I am sweating like a sieve, well, it's clear proof you're Al Qaeda.
[00:18:55.359 --> 00:19:01.184]  It's like if you have road almanacs in your car, clear proof you're Al Qaeda.
[00:19:01.544 --> 00:19:03.586]  Wrist watches, clear proof you're Al Qaeda.
[00:19:04.389 --> 00:19:05.510]  What were some of the other ones?
[00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.331]  Make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:19:08.371 --> 00:19:09.632]  Constitution, you're a terrorist.
[00:19:09.652 --> 00:19:13.453]  They have their actual training manuals and flyers and manuals for police.
[00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:16.975]  So we'll take your calls on that subject.
[00:19:16.995 --> 00:19:25.820]  Also, a man tasered in a hospital bed, forced to give urine sample, he was tied down, and he refused to urinate on demand, so they tasered him repeatedly with pleasure.
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:30.702]  That is torture, but that matter, all the cop shows show us this now, and
[00:19:31.365 --> 00:19:34.306]  It's always to fight Al-Qaeda, but in the real world, there's no real Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:34.326 --> 00:19:35.226]  There's Al-Qaeda.
[00:19:35.646 --> 00:19:39.408]  So they need to go ahead and act out their fantasies, because people don't have friends anymore.
[00:19:39.448 --> 00:19:41.728]  They simulate their friends with the TV shows.
[00:19:43.269 --> 00:19:49.351]  And so, we're taught how to behave from TV in every show now, about cops or the government, as good torture is.
[00:19:49.371 --> 00:19:54.052]  It's now admitted Homeland Security, Associated Press reporting, is actually funding this, as I told you it was.
[00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:54.592]  Very obvious.
[00:19:54.972 --> 00:19:56.133]  That just came out yesterday.
[00:19:57.133 --> 00:19:58.253]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:58.394 --> 00:19:58.974]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.622 --> 00:20:03.963]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:20:04.223 --> 00:20:08.064]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:20:08.384 --> 00:20:09.204]  Read the labels.
[00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:13.746]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:18.167]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:20:18.527 --> 00:20:23.409]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:27.391]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:20:27.572 --> 00:20:32.915]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:20:33.175 --> 00:20:35.917]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:20:36.217 --> 00:20:37.098]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:21:08.054 --> 00:21:08.914]  It still is.
[00:21:09.554 --> 00:21:13.016]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[00:21:13.376 --> 00:21:15.177]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:17.758]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[00:21:18.337 --> 00:21:20.358]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[00:21:20.738 --> 00:21:28.401]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.

[00:22:19.101 --> 00:22:27.005]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:22:27.425 --> 00:22:28.327]  We're good to go.

[00:23:00.450 --> 00:23:02.911]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.632 --> 00:23:07.253]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:23:07.894 --> 00:23:11.776]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:23:12.476 --> 00:23:21.040]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:23:21.852 --> 00:23:22.232]  1-800-516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736
[00:23:49.969 --> 00:23:50.530]  516-8736.
[00:23:53.312 --> 00:23:55.053]  Call now.
[00:23:55.113 --> 00:23:58.356]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:06.022 --> 00:24:07.944]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.424 --> 00:24:11.166]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:24.404 --> 00:24:30.628]  So they took this guy to jail, or to the hospital on suspicion of drugs.
[00:24:33.029 --> 00:24:42.474]  And they had him tied down and put a catheter in him, but there was no... They couldn't get the sample, and he's tied down.
[00:24:42.614 --> 00:24:44.135]  So they start tasering him.
[00:24:44.155 --> 00:24:45.976]  This is the Associated Press.
[00:24:46.396 --> 00:24:48.958]  Man tasered in hospital bed, forced to give urine sample.
[00:24:49.637 --> 00:24:58.923]  A police officer twice used a taser stun gun on a drug suspect who was restrained to a hospital bed because the man refused to give a urine sample, the medical staff authority said.
[00:24:59.884 --> 00:25:06.508]  Antonio Wheeler, 18, was arrested Friday on a drug charge and taken to an emergency room after telling officers he had consumed cocaine.
[00:25:06.688 --> 00:25:07.649]  They took him to get the sample.
[00:25:08.469 --> 00:25:12.992]  Because Wheeler said he had used the drugs, Florida hospital officials wanted a urine sample.
[00:25:13.392 --> 00:25:18.796]  A police affidavit said Wheeler wouldn't provide a sample on his own, so workers tried to catheterize him to get one.
[00:25:20.683 --> 00:25:31.480]  And it says that Wheeler was handcuffed to the hospital bed and then secured with leather straps after he refused to urinate in a cup when medical staff tried to insert the catheter to get a sample.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.522]  Wheeler refused to begin...
[00:25:33.363 --> 00:25:46.430]  And thrashing around the affidavit said, at one point, police officer Peter Linderkamp reported he jumped on the bed with his knees on Wheeler's chest to restrain him, but Wheeler still refused to let the catheter be inserted.
[00:25:47.271 --> 00:25:51.173]  The officer used a taser on him with 50,000 volts into the target.
[00:25:52.093 --> 00:26:02.559]  After the second shocks started, he stated he would urinate and calm down enough to be given the portable...
[00:26:03.539 --> 00:26:06.120]  Urinal, they said, whatever that means.
[00:26:06.681 --> 00:26:09.302]  So, this is the new freedom.
[00:26:10.043 --> 00:26:13.384]  If that isn't torture, I mean, he is tied down.
[00:26:14.705 --> 00:26:17.627]  And, now give it to us.
[00:26:17.747 --> 00:26:19.068]  I mean, come on!
[00:26:19.388 --> 00:26:20.488]  Nobody's threatened.
[00:26:20.849 --> 00:26:22.069]  Nobody's in danger.
[00:26:22.289 --> 00:26:26.652]  We're going to shoot you with a life-threatening device in a hospital bed.
[00:26:27.912 --> 00:26:29.733]  Answer my questions, because that's what it is.
[00:26:29.753 --> 00:26:30.594]  It's a Fifth Amendment issue.
[00:26:31.232 --> 00:26:32.993]  They can argue that they can take your blood or whatever.
[00:26:33.053 --> 00:26:33.353]  Fine.
[00:26:33.834 --> 00:26:34.154]  Okay.
[00:26:34.274 --> 00:26:37.996]  But the point is, you don't have to torture somebody to make them do what you want.
[00:26:38.016 --> 00:26:39.117]  I mean, this is textbook.
[00:26:39.997 --> 00:26:41.478]  And it's being hailed as good.
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.862]  See, now it's just openly, yeah, this is what we do to you.
[00:26:48.822 --> 00:26:52.244]  And I want to go to your calls, but I want to talk about torture in America coming up.
[00:26:52.304 --> 00:26:53.245]  Let's go quickly to your calls.
[00:26:53.725 --> 00:26:56.607]  Robert in Colorado, you're on the air.
[00:26:56.627 --> 00:26:57.067]  Go ahead.
[00:26:57.627 --> 00:26:58.968]  Good morning, Alexander.
[00:26:59.028 --> 00:26:59.668]  How are you?
[00:26:59.929 --> 00:27:00.489]  Good, my friend.
[00:27:00.967 --> 00:27:02.007]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[00:27:02.027 --> 00:27:02.507]  I appreciate it.
[00:27:02.528 --> 00:27:03.148]  You're right at the point.
[00:27:04.068 --> 00:27:11.310]  You did not get a chance to hear George Nury's interview with Andre Eggleston a couple of nights ago, did you?
[00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:12.071]  No, I didn't.
[00:27:12.671 --> 00:27:12.991]  Okay.
[00:27:13.211 --> 00:27:14.731]  The guy was fantastic.
[00:27:14.771 --> 00:27:17.372]  He's written a book called Thieves in the Temple.
[00:27:17.492 --> 00:27:19.573]  I'm going to get him on.
[00:27:20.245 --> 00:27:22.867]  Okay, yeah, I was about to say, if you're interested, it's up to you.
[00:27:23.007 --> 00:27:25.509]  I recorded the interview, and I can shoot you a CD audio.
[00:27:25.549 --> 00:27:27.611]  No, I've heard him on this network.
[00:27:28.071 --> 00:27:31.173]  Oh, so you know who... And he was on a local radio station a few months ago.
[00:27:31.234 --> 00:27:40.881]  My wife called in, and the local KLBJ, and was talking about the New World Order, and he was now... This isn't a conspiracy.
[00:27:40.941 --> 00:27:42.963]  The Federal Reserve is private.
[00:27:43.003 --> 00:27:43.943]  It's just that simple.
[00:27:44.404 --> 00:27:46.605]  I thought that was funny, but I'm going to get him on.
[00:27:47.146 --> 00:27:47.586]  Please do.
[00:27:47.626 --> 00:27:48.587]  He's incredible, man.
[00:27:48.607 --> 00:27:49.147]  Knows his stuff.
[00:27:49.728 --> 00:27:49.828]  Um...
[00:27:51.018 --> 00:28:01.724]  A couple of weeks ago, you were talking about Secretary of State, female, help me here, in the Bush administration.
[00:28:01.744 --> 00:28:02.985]  Yeah, Condoleezza Rice.
[00:28:03.005 --> 00:28:03.445]  Yeah, thanks.
[00:28:03.586 --> 00:28:07.048]  And President Bush, you said they were very good friends, I think is the way you put it.
[00:28:07.688 --> 00:28:09.809]  Were you insinuating they were sleeping together?
[00:28:09.829 --> 00:28:10.750]  Is that where you're going with that?
[00:28:12.054 --> 00:28:14.295]  Well, that's been insinuated by the mainstream media.
[00:28:15.035 --> 00:28:15.455]  Oh, okay.
[00:28:15.656 --> 00:28:22.258]  Yeah, it's funny that you said that, because I was kind of thinking the same thing a few weeks ago, and to hear you say that kind of substantiated my thoughts.
[00:28:22.298 --> 00:28:24.259]  But one last thing, I know I'm out of time.
[00:28:24.999 --> 00:28:31.282]  About the same time, you talked about Magic Johnson getting a cure for the AIDS virus.
[00:28:32.012 --> 00:28:32.713]  Is that true?
[00:28:32.733 --> 00:28:34.695]  Some kind of shot or something he was given?
[00:28:34.735 --> 00:28:35.316]  Well, yes.
[00:28:35.796 --> 00:28:43.845]  While he's out peddling and pushing the AIDS drugs, the HIV drugs that actually kill people, he doesn't take them himself and he's fine.
[00:28:44.617 --> 00:28:45.518]  Now, see, that's funny.
[00:28:45.638 --> 00:28:56.548]  I read a big write-up in SI, about two or three years ago, about him, where he said that he completely changed his diet and worked out really hard, and that's what put his HIV virus in remission.
[00:28:56.649 --> 00:29:00.392]  And, yeah, that's what the actual treatment is.
[00:29:00.432 --> 00:29:08.260]  I mean, how do you take an autoimmune suppressant when you have a virus that supposedly attacks T lymphocytes,
[00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:14.763]  Or white blood cell commanders, they go out and program the other white blood cells what to do.
[00:29:14.783 --> 00:29:16.464]  That's what HIV supposedly targets.
[00:29:16.824 --> 00:29:24.448]  So how do you take an autoimmune suppressant, or really it's pesticides are the drugs they give people, it's the drugs that kill you.
[00:29:24.468 --> 00:29:26.389]  And that's major medical reports.
[00:29:26.429 --> 00:29:27.049]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:37.575]  We're going to come back and talk to Craig and Andy and Sikander, I believe is how you pronounce it, Gary and others.
[00:29:38.684 --> 00:29:40.004]  We're on the march.
[00:29:40.024 --> 00:29:40.885]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:41.005 --> 00:29:43.585]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:32:08.833 --> 00:32:13.077]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.297 --> 00:32:20.344]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.724 --> 00:32:26.830]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:26.970 --> 00:32:28.191]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:28.371 --> 00:32:28.832]  We're good to go.

[00:32:49.757 --> 00:32:49.957]  Call today.
[00:33:14.272 --> 00:33:25.178]  My new film, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, full title, Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[00:33:25.798 --> 00:33:33.222]  It is my best work ever, and I would encourage every single solitary one of you out there to get this video.
[00:33:33.302 --> 00:33:37.644]  It is an information warfare tool, jam-packed with the truth.
[00:33:39.435 --> 00:33:41.677]  It is two hours, 35 minutes long.
[00:33:41.697 --> 00:33:43.318]  You're really getting three films in one.
[00:33:43.558 --> 00:33:55.928]  The latest police state developments from the RNC, the hover blimps, the sound wave cannons, police threatening to arrest us three times a day, arresting peaceful reporters, the FEMA camp they put 2,000 people in.
[00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:00.711]  That's just the first 35 minutes of the film.
[00:34:00.731 --> 00:34:04.054]  I mean, I confront Michael Moore about his filming of Whitewash.
[00:34:05.135 --> 00:34:07.817]  I mean, there's so much just in that first...
[00:34:08.539 --> 00:34:09.720]  First 35-minute segment.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:11.501]  Then we spend an hour on 9-11.
[00:34:11.681 --> 00:34:17.466]  It is the most comprehensive 9-11 film, bar none, in just 60 minutes alone.
[00:34:17.966 --> 00:34:19.087]  It's three separate films.
[00:34:19.127 --> 00:34:20.628]  It's even set up that way.
[00:34:21.509 --> 00:34:23.951]  The third part is we show you who the elite are.
[00:34:24.371 --> 00:34:27.053]  We show how Skull and Bones is really a Nazi death cult.
[00:34:28.197 --> 00:34:32.300]  That they all grow out of the same thing, how they all work in a network, how the Bushes funded Hitler.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:34.222]  Then we get into Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:34:34.542 --> 00:34:38.845]  Then we show Bush and his swearing in in January.
[00:34:39.825 --> 00:34:46.450]  And then we show in the last ten minutes what they've actually done to the country with the Democrats, how they're dismantling the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:34:47.511 --> 00:34:51.273]  So much is covered in this two-hour, 35-minute film.
[00:34:51.313 --> 00:34:53.275]  You've absolutely got to get it.
[00:34:54.556 --> 00:34:54.676]  And...
[00:34:55.606 --> 00:34:57.347]  We now have the videos.
[00:34:57.388 --> 00:34:59.870]  We're going to be starting to ship these babies out tomorrow.
[00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:02.271]  So go ahead and order them today.
[00:35:02.372 --> 00:35:03.112]  Do not wait.
[00:35:03.653 --> 00:35:07.876]  Your support is also vital by purchasing the films.
[00:35:08.016 --> 00:35:12.700]  And I authorize you to make copies of the videos for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:35:12.760 --> 00:35:16.983]  I beg you to air them on local cable access TV to show them to your college students.
[00:35:18.525 --> 00:35:19.345]  This is the film.
[00:35:19.505 --> 00:35:20.486]  You've got to get it.
[00:35:20.526 --> 00:35:21.447]  You've got to see it.
[00:35:22.127 --> 00:35:25.130]  You can go to InfoWars.com and watch some clips from the film.
[00:35:26.081 --> 00:35:29.102]  You can order it via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[00:35:29.162 --> 00:35:30.162]  Order hard copies of it.
[00:35:30.602 --> 00:35:33.423]  Or you can call toll-free to get a copy or any of my other great videos.
[00:35:33.463 --> 00:35:34.443]  Bunch of big discounts.
[00:35:34.844 --> 00:35:37.424]  But we're still running on some of the other films and books and materials.
[00:35:37.764 --> 00:35:40.245]  We carry other great documentaries by other great researchers.
[00:35:41.145 --> 00:35:42.746]  One triple eight.
[00:35:44.186 --> 00:35:44.206]  253-3139.
[00:35:45.427 --> 00:35:52.929]  The film is $25.95, but if you order three or more of any of the 12 films I've made, they drop down to $19.95.
[00:35:53.550 --> 00:35:56.551]  That's an $18 discount on the three-tape special.
[00:35:56.831 --> 00:36:00.872]  And you can get the new film as part of a three-tape special if you want to save the money.
[00:36:03.478 --> 00:36:16.262]  888-253-3139, or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:36:17.062 --> 00:36:20.423]  And of course, if you're a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, it takes about a minute to sign up.
[00:36:20.823 --> 00:36:23.444]  Your own private passcode and secure server.
[00:36:23.864 --> 00:36:26.845]  You can watch all my films, my weekly TV special reports.
[00:36:27.808 --> 00:36:31.769]  Read my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other e-books, dozens of other films.
[00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:33.409]  We've been authorized to post.
[00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:36.970]  My best audio interviews from the radio show, listen in your leisure.
[00:36:38.151 --> 00:36:40.111]  PrisonPlanet.tv, so take action.
[00:36:40.131 --> 00:36:43.192]  All right, let's go back to the calls, and I want to get more into this U.S.
[00:36:43.212 --> 00:36:48.153]  Marine Calls public story of Saddam fiction, Shades of the Private Lynch fable.
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:51.481]  Man tasered in hospital bed, forced to give urine sample.
[00:36:51.921 --> 00:36:53.542]  This is mass torture here in America.
[00:36:53.922 --> 00:36:55.903]  Sweating in an airport, you could be a terrorist.
[00:36:55.923 --> 00:36:56.583]  That's all coming up.
[00:36:56.923 --> 00:37:00.165]  Right now, let's talk to Craig in Wisconsin.
[00:37:00.225 --> 00:37:00.925]  Craig, welcome.
[00:37:00.945 --> 00:37:02.245]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:37:02.445 --> 00:37:02.686]  Good.
[00:37:03.466 --> 00:37:04.426]  I'm a little off subject.
[00:37:04.866 --> 00:37:05.707]  There is no subject.
[00:37:05.727 --> 00:37:08.648]  I don't know if you were paying attention to the left co-judge murders.
[00:37:10.152 --> 00:37:25.657]  They were trying to claim that it was the right-wingers, the militia, maybe the white supremacists, and now it's somebody who'd been in lawsuits in the judge's court over cancer, and the guy blew his own brains out and said he did it.
[00:37:26.438 --> 00:37:27.198]  I don't know if he did.
[00:37:27.238 --> 00:37:28.378]  Oh, there's a note, too, right?
[00:37:28.658 --> 00:37:28.898]  Yeah.
[00:37:29.158 --> 00:37:31.679]  Okay, well, I just thought that was quite strange.
[00:37:31.739 --> 00:37:37.961]  They had 322 shells in the van with them, and of course the .22 is a very common tool, isn't it?
[00:37:38.182 --> 00:37:39.442]  Wouldn't you say for assassination?
[00:37:40.333 --> 00:37:41.114]  A .22 caliber?
[00:37:41.194 --> 00:37:44.856]  Yeah, because the bullet deforms and bounces around inside the head.
[00:37:44.876 --> 00:37:49.800]  You do a triple tap to the head is the favorite CIA assassination tactic.
[00:37:50.661 --> 00:37:54.804]  They like to use low-velocity .22 shells because it doesn't even hardly make a sound, just a popping.
[00:37:55.585 --> 00:38:00.088]  And you walk up to somebody and pop them once, point blank.
[00:38:00.168 --> 00:38:05.272]  And just the gas from the expanding powder...
[00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:09.294]  Even without a lead shell at point-blank range will kill you.
[00:38:09.354 --> 00:38:13.438]  It shoots the gas into the brain, turning it into basically scrambled eggs.
[00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:14.819]  Yep.
[00:38:15.279 --> 00:38:17.761]  There's another thing I was... I didn't know if he... So they're saying he used a .22?
[00:38:18.022 --> 00:38:22.405]  They're saying that there was 300-something shells in the van when they found him.
[00:38:22.746 --> 00:38:28.050]  And I was just wondering, okay, the cop pulled him over because it was the only place in Wisconsin and it had a taillight out.
[00:38:28.671 --> 00:38:29.932]  Okay, that's suspicious, I guess.
[00:38:30.052 --> 00:38:33.455]  And then he... Where's the car squad video?
[00:38:34.033 --> 00:38:37.275]  Of him shooting himself before, you know, that probably will never be seen.
[00:38:37.735 --> 00:38:42.937]  And there's accounts that he was saying anti-government statements about this.
[00:38:43.198 --> 00:38:43.998]  Government's a Nazi.
[00:38:44.907 --> 00:39:03.040]  Yeah, you know, the classic story of the government is trying to merge the right wing with the Nazis, claiming there's a connection, and then connect that in with Al-Qaeda.
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:09.965]  They've really been trying to create that public perception, and that's why the tribal racist talk...
[00:39:11.182 --> 00:39:16.605]  That Hispanics, Blacks, Whites engage in only feeds into the New World Order's paradigm.
[00:39:16.825 --> 00:39:20.527]  You've got to watch people who perseverate on those topics.
[00:39:21.668 --> 00:39:25.890]  Yeah, you'd think they wouldn't talk about it, but it's getting kind of drilled.
[00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.611]  That's what they're drilling.
[00:39:27.971 --> 00:39:31.333]  And, of course, he's obviously mentally ill on top of it.
[00:39:31.393 --> 00:39:34.995]  So it's like if you talk about the government, you probably have a problem.
[00:39:37.501 --> 00:39:39.222]  Yeah, that's the bottom line.
[00:39:39.262 --> 00:39:41.323]  That's what they like to imply and say.
[00:39:41.944 --> 00:39:42.604]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[00:39:42.704 --> 00:39:43.384]  I saw your movie.
[00:39:43.565 --> 00:39:45.386]  I'll say it was great and very informative.
[00:39:45.406 --> 00:39:47.207]  Probably most informative I've seen about 9-11.
[00:39:47.247 --> 00:39:50.168]  You definitely boil it down in that hour there.
[00:39:50.529 --> 00:39:52.350]  So you watched the two-and-a-half-hour film?
[00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:54.571]  Yes, I got it on Prison Planet TV.
[00:39:54.691 --> 00:39:55.271]  I'm a member.
[00:39:55.451 --> 00:39:56.612]  Well, thank you for your support.
[00:39:56.792 --> 00:39:59.534]  Of the three parts, which one did you think was the most powerful?
[00:39:59.934 --> 00:40:03.596]  I'd have to say the 9-11, even though I was pretty much already a prisoner of the choir with me.
[00:40:03.716 --> 00:40:06.418]  But it just, you know, you just did nothing but...
[00:40:07.512 --> 00:40:09.893]  Prove every point to the 10th degree, you know.
[00:40:09.973 --> 00:40:10.833]  It's just so hard.
[00:40:10.893 --> 00:40:12.654]  I mean, the Marvin Bush doing security.
[00:40:12.674 --> 00:40:16.115]  I mean, it's just never-ending how it's all just connected, you know.
[00:40:17.175 --> 00:40:19.116]  Yeah, we show what the Bushes were all doing on 9-11.
[00:40:19.536 --> 00:40:20.976]  Oh, meet with the head of the Bin Laden family.
[00:40:21.036 --> 00:40:21.997]  Running security.
[00:40:22.497 --> 00:40:24.737]  You know, declaring martial law in Florida.
[00:40:24.757 --> 00:40:27.598]  You know, it's just on and on and on and on.
[00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:31.019]  It was very informative, Alex, and you're doing a great job.
[00:40:31.219 --> 00:40:32.760]  Well, I appreciate your support, sir.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:33.220]  Take care.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:35.221]  Andy in Florida.
[00:40:35.301 --> 00:40:35.901]  Andy, go ahead.
[00:40:36.348 --> 00:40:38.050]  Yeah, I just got a quick question.
[00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:41.993]  First, I want to tell you, you are the greatest and I really appreciate everything you're doing.
[00:40:42.513 --> 00:40:45.156]  I tell everybody about you and I'm waiting on the tape.
[00:40:45.376 --> 00:40:50.961]  When I get the tape, I'm just going to continually make copies and distribute it to everybody I know.
[00:40:51.982 --> 00:41:01.030]  My question is, I just wanted to get your quick opinion and comments on David Icke and his ideas and beliefs on the Illuminati.
[00:41:02.871 --> 00:41:03.071]  Well...
[00:41:04.858 --> 00:41:06.179]  I've had David Icahn a few times.
[00:41:06.239 --> 00:41:07.160]  I want to have him back on.
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:08.100]  Very eloquent.
[00:41:08.221 --> 00:41:09.161]  Very intelligent.
[00:41:10.222 --> 00:41:10.722]  Riveting.
[00:41:11.443 --> 00:41:12.083]  Dynamic.
[00:41:13.144 --> 00:41:16.326]  You know, cult of personality type guy.
[00:41:16.346 --> 00:41:18.368]  He was a champion goalie.
[00:41:18.388 --> 00:41:21.410]  You know, for a national league over there in England.
[00:41:21.970 --> 00:41:23.211]  Soccer, they call it football.
[00:41:24.612 --> 00:41:26.033]  He was the head of the Green Party.
[00:41:26.313 --> 00:41:28.835]  He was a top BBC presenter.
[00:41:28.855 --> 00:41:31.117]  You know, the equivalent of the top sportscaster.
[00:41:32.558 --> 00:41:33.759]  And then all of a sudden one day...
[00:41:34.716 --> 00:41:38.859]  He just walked onto a national TV show and said, I'm Jesus.
[00:41:41.801 --> 00:41:43.122]  And I've had him on and talked to him about that.
[00:41:43.142 --> 00:41:46.444]  He said, well, that was a figure of speech in a world, the Christ, kind of that New Age thing.
[00:41:47.225 --> 00:41:51.668]  And he eloquently talks about the Federal Reserve and the New World War and the Bilderberg Group, and it's very convincing.
[00:41:52.729 --> 00:41:53.689]  And all that is true.
[00:41:54.730 --> 00:42:00.494]  But then he mixes into it, basically, the interdimensional space alien type deal, which we can't prove one way or the other.
[00:42:01.269 --> 00:42:02.790]  I mean, true strength is fiction, folks.
[00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.691]  I don't put anything down these days.
[00:42:04.711 --> 00:42:06.952]  You know, a serpent in the garden, whatever.
[00:42:06.972 --> 00:42:19.699]  But the point is, is he adds all that on top of it, and then people, then when they hear me talk about the Federal Reserve, which the Federal Reserve admits it's private, I talk about all this real documented stuff, people go, oh, but that's that guy with the lizards.
[00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:20.680]  Right.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:28.804]  So overall, I think it's sensational, and it sells a lot of books, and, you know, he can do that if he wants to.
[00:42:29.284 --> 00:42:30.025]  But that's where I...
[00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:36.288]  Part with David Icke is on the blood-drinking reptoids from the 12th Dimension.
[00:42:36.728 --> 00:42:38.008]  Okay, yeah, that's what I thought.
[00:42:38.028 --> 00:42:39.689]  That's cool.
[00:42:39.709 --> 00:42:40.810]  That's all I wanted to know.
[00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:42.911]  All right, I appreciate it.
[00:42:43.051 --> 00:42:44.672]  And, you know, it's funny you mentioned David Icke.
[00:42:44.732 --> 00:42:45.572]  I've been emailing him.
[00:42:45.592 --> 00:42:46.853]  He normally gets back to me right away.
[00:42:46.873 --> 00:42:48.714]  I haven't heard back from him.
[00:42:49.794 --> 00:42:52.516]  In fact, I keep forgetting every day to tell my producer to contact him again.
[00:42:52.556 --> 00:42:59.379]  Guys, will you call my producer right now, in case they're not listening, and tell him, email and call David Icke again.
[00:43:00.407 --> 00:43:05.129]  It's been like two weeks since I tried again, and I want David Icke on this show.
[00:43:06.169 --> 00:43:06.930]  I want to have him on.
[00:43:06.970 --> 00:43:11.231]  Just because he's interesting, and you've been wanting to hear from him.
[00:43:11.431 --> 00:43:15.313]  We haven't had him on in about a year, so we'll have David Icke on for you.
[00:43:18.214 --> 00:43:19.174]  He's a nice guy, though.
[00:43:19.194 --> 00:43:23.316]  I've said some bad things about him before on national British television.
[00:43:24.636 --> 00:43:26.757]  He didn't even get really mad at me about it.
[00:43:27.746 --> 00:43:28.808]  He's an interesting fellow.
[00:43:29.048 --> 00:43:30.770]  I don't like what he says about Christianity.
[00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:32.732]  I don't buy that part either.
[00:43:33.553 --> 00:43:35.536]  David Icke.
[00:43:37.058 --> 00:43:39.000]  I liken him to something in the punch bowl.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.703]  We've got all this punch that everybody's ready to drink out of.
[00:43:41.803 --> 00:43:43.125]  It's good, nutritious punch.
[00:43:43.843 --> 00:43:47.485]  It's real information, and then he puts something in it that kind of spoils it.
[00:43:48.026 --> 00:43:51.828]  But that was wrong, and I've apologized for that several times.
[00:43:53.389 --> 00:43:54.209]  David Icke is a gentleman.
[00:43:54.329 --> 00:43:54.750]  I'll say that.
[00:43:55.130 --> 00:43:55.770]  Okay, that's enough.
[00:43:56.331 --> 00:44:03.695]  Let's go ahead and talk to Sykender in Ontario, Canada.
[00:44:03.755 --> 00:44:04.155]  Go ahead.
[00:44:04.195 --> 00:44:05.236]  Or Toronto, excuse me.
[00:44:05.536 --> 00:44:06.277]  It's Sykender.
[00:44:06.577 --> 00:44:07.317]  Sykender!
[00:44:07.477 --> 00:44:08.178]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:44:08.358 --> 00:44:10.059]  It's actually Alexander in English.
[00:44:10.862 --> 00:44:11.322]  All right.
[00:44:11.963 --> 00:44:12.803]  Is that old English?
[00:44:13.603 --> 00:44:15.464]  Well, no.
[00:44:15.704 --> 00:44:16.825]  I'm actually a Muslim.
[00:44:17.605 --> 00:44:19.526]  I'm from East Africa.
[00:44:19.606 --> 00:44:20.227]  Oh, I got you.
[00:44:20.467 --> 00:44:21.067]  Okay, sure.
[00:44:21.087 --> 00:44:21.707]  Now I understand.
[00:44:21.807 --> 00:44:24.008]  You're saying the translation into English is Alex.
[00:44:24.188 --> 00:44:24.629]  That's right.
[00:44:24.989 --> 00:44:25.469]  That's right.
[00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:27.530]  Actually, it means great.
[00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:35.534]  But anyways, my comment is that I've been hearing you for the last couple weeks and doing such a great job.
[00:44:36.375 --> 00:44:44.562]  You know, opening my eyes up, and especially looking at some of the clips online at InfoWars, that's what I'm actually listening to right now.
[00:44:45.483 --> 00:44:47.044]  And you're just doing a great job.
[00:44:49.005 --> 00:44:51.728]  Do you think people up in Canada are waking up to 9-11?
[00:44:51.988 --> 00:44:52.428]  You know what?
[00:44:53.069 --> 00:44:55.050]  I speak to my friends about it all the time.
[00:44:55.771 --> 00:44:58.113]  And I mean, from day one.
[00:44:58.413 --> 00:45:00.695]  I mean, from 9-11 itself.
[00:45:01.015 --> 00:45:03.297]  It's like things have changed in the world.
[00:45:03.617 --> 00:45:04.418]  Things have changed in...
[00:45:05.183 --> 00:45:27.581]  In North America, and I mean, being Muslim, I feel like it's weird because prior to 9-11, I would tell people I'm Muslim or whatnot, and I wouldn't have a stigma on me, or people wouldn't look at me differently, or think about me differently.
[00:45:27.621 --> 00:45:34.647]  Now, after 9-11, I'm just like, since 9-11, every day in politics and in news, everything is about
[00:45:35.276 --> 00:45:37.756]  Terrorism, terrorism, terrorism.
[00:45:37.836 --> 00:45:44.038]  And there has been the stereotype of the evil, dirty Muslim, you know, who's going to kill you any minute.
[00:45:44.578 --> 00:45:44.798]  Right.
[00:45:44.838 --> 00:45:48.098]  And that's just not been my experience with Muslims that I know.
[00:45:48.378 --> 00:45:49.438]  No, exactly.
[00:45:50.059 --> 00:45:50.459]  Exactly.
[00:45:50.499 --> 00:45:57.040]  Islam is a religion of peace, a faith of peace.
[00:45:57.140 --> 00:46:00.160]  And, I mean, that's what Islam is about.
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:03.921]  But, I mean, I can understand, you know, the...
[00:46:04.693 --> 00:46:08.697]  I mean, people can't even wake up to see what's going on in the world right now.
[00:46:09.437 --> 00:46:14.181]  People don't understand that, you know, this stuff is controlled.
[00:46:14.422 --> 00:46:17.845]  I mean, the evidence has been, the evidence is there.
[00:46:18.265 --> 00:46:21.848]  People just need to open up their eyes, and I mean, I think you're doing a good job doing that.
[00:46:21.868 --> 00:46:26.012]  Well, I hear you, and I appreciate the call, and please tell your friends and family about the broadcast.
[00:46:26.032 --> 00:46:26.452]  Take care.
[00:46:27.533 --> 00:46:28.954]  Look, I mean, I want to be clear about this.
[00:46:29.034 --> 00:46:29.575]  I'm a Christian.
[00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:37.292]  And I'm not a Muslim, and I don't believe in the Muslim faith, but you have your right to believe in what you want to believe.
[00:46:37.932 --> 00:46:43.193]  Our government has purposefully radicalized the Muslims.
[00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:55.116]  I mean, we have the Washington Post article from three years ago where they paid millions of dollars for the radical Hadiths for the children all over the Middle East where four hand grenades equals four.
[00:46:55.897 --> 00:46:57.417]  And, you know, kill the infidels.
[00:46:58.504 --> 00:47:00.846]  And the excuse was this was a balance to communism.
[00:47:00.866 --> 00:47:02.627]  Well, the Muslims were never going to go along with communism.
[00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:05.530]  It's diametrically opposed to their faith.
[00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:06.831]  I mean, everybody knows that.
[00:47:07.911 --> 00:47:19.380]  And when you've got people in Iran in the 50s who were pro-West, anti-communist, our government overthrew them and put in the Shah, which then caused the Mullahs to get in.
[00:47:21.042 --> 00:47:21.162]  And...
[00:47:23.134 --> 00:47:25.236]  Look, you can look at the tyrants of the Middle East.
[00:47:25.276 --> 00:47:26.218]  Sure, there are a bunch of tyrants.
[00:47:26.638 --> 00:47:30.303]  And most of the tyrants are put into power by the globalists.
[00:47:31.404 --> 00:47:35.008]  And any time you get a good leader in one of those countries, they get assassinated or overthrown.
[00:47:35.028 --> 00:47:36.670]  Because they don't want strong leaders, period.
[00:47:37.011 --> 00:47:38.012]  Even if they're pro-West.
[00:47:38.473 --> 00:47:39.434]  They just do not want it.
[00:47:40.339 --> 00:47:46.241]  And it's the Muslim leaders that are tolerant to Christians and where Christianity thrives that are targeted.
[00:47:46.662 --> 00:47:57.826]  Where they murder Christians and go after them, like Saudi Arabia, where a Christian can't stick their nose up above, you know, out of their door jam in order to get blown off.
[00:47:57.866 --> 00:47:59.086]  I mean, that's our buddies.
[00:47:59.847 --> 00:48:01.227]  So it's a complete fraud.
[00:48:03.448 --> 00:48:08.250]  And, you know, I've got a problem with the so-called evangelical Christian leaders
[00:48:09.145 --> 00:48:09.926]  We're good to go.
[00:48:09.946 --> 00:48:10.106]  I think?
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:32.722]  Unless you talk about Saudi Arabia, which is just unspeakably corrupt.
[00:48:32.782 --> 00:48:33.503]  They're elite there.
[00:48:33.963 --> 00:48:35.424]  Just unspeakably evil.
[00:48:35.924 --> 00:48:37.005]  But their people know that.
[00:48:37.045 --> 00:48:37.765]  They're not stupid.
[00:48:37.785 --> 00:48:44.770]  And our government's trying to keep all those bad dictatorships, those hereditary dictatorships, in control.
[00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:46.871]  And that's shameful.
[00:48:48.012 --> 00:48:57.238]  But, no, I mean, I went to high school and college with Muslims, and they all seemed like respectful, intelligent, very respectful people.
[00:48:59.006 --> 00:49:00.707]  Very thoughtful.
[00:49:01.487 --> 00:49:03.728]  I mean, the total opposite of the stereotype.
[00:49:05.229 --> 00:49:15.533]  So, I really don't know what to say, but that's been my experience with Arabs.
[00:49:15.693 --> 00:49:17.513]  Of course, all Arabs are not Muslim either.
[00:49:17.553 --> 00:49:19.614]  What is it, like 10% of them are Christians?
[00:49:20.254 --> 00:49:21.935]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[00:49:22.955 --> 00:49:26.877]  Let's go ahead and talk to Gary in South Carolina.
[00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:27.477]  Go ahead, Gary.
[00:49:28.488 --> 00:49:29.729]  Gary McLeod here.
[00:49:29.789 --> 00:49:30.470]  How are you, sir?
[00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.990]  Good, sir.
[00:49:32.171 --> 00:49:36.954]  I've got solutions to nearly every problem that I ever hear raised on talk radio.
[00:49:37.635 --> 00:49:38.876]  I've got two solutions.
[00:49:39.756 --> 00:49:52.706]  One is Citizens for Constitutional Government, and the other one is getting someone like another Ron Paul or another Tom Pancritto in Congress, and I'm running for Congress.
[00:49:54.427 --> 00:49:57.129]  I'd like to be considered as a future guest on your show.
[00:49:58.109 --> 00:50:00.131]  You're running for Congress out of South Carolina?
[00:50:00.591 --> 00:50:00.891]  Right.
[00:50:01.111 --> 00:50:01.752]  What district?
[00:50:02.452 --> 00:50:04.294]  6th Congressional District.
[00:50:05.134 --> 00:50:18.084]  I'm running against a liberal who voted for same-sex marriage ten times, voted even for partial birth abortion three times.
[00:50:18.104 --> 00:50:21.787]  Well, then you must not like Bush's appointees, then.
[00:50:21.807 --> 00:50:24.369]  There's a lot of things about Bush I don't like.
[00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:26.651]  Last time I ran, I ran on the...
[00:50:28.439 --> 00:50:32.580]  Republican Party and the Constitutional Party simultaneously.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:37.581]  I was a fusion candidate, and you told your votes together.
[00:50:39.101 --> 00:50:41.342]  All right, well, send me your platform, sir.
[00:50:41.442 --> 00:50:43.842]  It's just there's so many thousands of candidates.
[00:50:43.902 --> 00:50:49.383]  If I ever started having candidates on here, it'd be the end of the broadcast.
[00:50:49.443 --> 00:50:50.544]  But who knows?
[00:50:50.584 --> 00:50:51.244]  Send me some info.
[00:50:51.284 --> 00:50:51.824]  I might have you on.
[00:50:52.424 --> 00:50:53.424]  Mr. McCloud.
[00:50:53.444 --> 00:50:54.904]  What a cool last name.
[00:50:55.305 --> 00:50:56.045]  McCloud.
[00:50:56.765 --> 00:50:57.445]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.579 --> 00:51:05.923]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.104 --> 00:51:10.528]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.668 --> 00:51:15.052]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.092 --> 00:51:16.454]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.236 --> 00:51:22.457]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.517 --> 00:51:29.439]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.579 --> 00:51:31.640]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:42.303]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.563 --> 00:51:43.063]  If you want to

[00:54:13.851 --> 00:54:19.356]  Continuing with your phone calls coming up in the next hour, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:19.376 --> 00:54:19.797]  Let me, uh...
[00:54:25.962 --> 00:54:31.006]  Go over a couple different articles here that just show really how serious the police state's gotten.
[00:54:31.326 --> 00:54:32.227]  This is all the Reuters.
[00:54:32.568 --> 00:54:33.648]  Sweating in an airport?
[00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:35.130]  You could be a terrorist.
[00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:36.090]  That's the headline.
[00:54:36.110 --> 00:54:43.356]  The suicide bomber clips a shrapnel-filled belt around his waist and buttons up his jacket to conceal it.
[00:54:43.617 --> 00:54:45.538]  See, they're selling this like this is normal.
[00:54:45.578 --> 00:54:46.339]  See, this is normal.
[00:54:46.899 --> 00:54:49.962]  As he turns back and forth in front of a semicircular white panel...
[00:54:51.288 --> 00:54:58.375]  About the size of a shower cubicle, a computer monitor shows the metal-packed cylinder standing out clearly in white against his body.
[00:54:59.195 --> 00:55:00.697]  This is no real security alarm.
[00:55:00.737 --> 00:55:12.707]  It's a demonstration of the British Technology Group, QuintiQ, of a scanning device that sees under people's clothes to spot not just metal, but other potential threats like chromatic knives or hidden drugs.
[00:55:13.502 --> 00:55:13.883]  We're good to go.
[00:55:35.075 --> 00:55:38.999]  By the corporation formerly part of the research arm of the British Defense Ministry.
[00:55:39.440 --> 00:55:42.723]  And they've sold that off for pennies on the dollar to private corporations.
[00:55:42.743 --> 00:55:44.084]  That's what privatization is.
[00:55:44.485 --> 00:55:50.811]  The people that were in government, they then sell themselves or their friends the companies for pennies on the dollar.
[00:55:50.851 --> 00:55:55.636]  Just like the Russian reforms were just six oligarchs being given the entire economy.
[00:55:57.478 --> 00:56:07.841]  Actually detecting a suicide bomber in the lobby of an airport is not a great thing to happen, Simon Stinger, new managing director of the company, security business, says was an understatement.
[00:56:09.301 --> 00:56:11.041]  And are you sweating too much?
[00:56:11.061 --> 00:56:16.503]  Another prospect in store for air travelers is hyperspectral sensing.
[00:56:16.583 --> 00:56:21.304]  It will check for chemicals called pheromones secreted in the body.
[00:56:22.748 --> 00:56:24.810]  Which may indicate agitation or stress.
[00:56:24.850 --> 00:56:28.292]  People under stress tend to exude slightly different pheromones.
[00:56:28.392 --> 00:56:39.638]  Oh, none of us have ever been stressful trying to, you know, you fly into Chicago and you've got to run, run, literally run, to get to your connection.
[00:56:40.179 --> 00:56:45.082]  And you're sweating, you're upset, you've got a stomachache, whatever, that's it, you're Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:45.542 --> 00:56:47.843]  People under stress tend to exude slightly different pheromones.
[00:56:47.863 --> 00:56:49.104]  Now they're going to sniff your pheromones.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:52.242]  There are sensing techniques we're working on.
[00:56:52.282 --> 00:56:59.708]  The stress may have an innocent cause, such as fear of flying, but also could betray the nervousness of a potential attack.
[00:57:00.809 --> 00:57:01.910]  This is all quackery.
[00:57:01.970 --> 00:57:05.293]  These brain scans, these pheromone sensors, all this.
[00:57:06.434 --> 00:57:07.735]  Oh, it shows you're agitated.
[00:57:07.915 --> 00:57:08.856]  That's their excuse.
[00:57:08.896 --> 00:57:10.518]  Oh, you have an almanac in your car.
[00:57:10.558 --> 00:57:11.739]  That's a sign of terrorism.
[00:57:11.799 --> 00:57:12.640]  Oh, wristwatches.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:13.020]  Oh.
[00:57:13.863 --> 00:57:18.146]  The point is to alert security staff to something unusual that may need further investigation.
[00:57:18.747 --> 00:57:32.417]  As with MMW, the technology could function at a distance and without the need for people to wait in line, but conducting such checks while people are approaching the airport and moving through it, authorities could avoid bottlenecks and other problems.
[00:57:33.618 --> 00:57:34.899]  Then suspicious movements.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.141]  The biometrics.
[00:57:38.201 --> 00:57:41.444]  Are you walking unusually according to your normal walk?
[00:57:42.668 --> 00:57:43.048]  Hmm.
[00:57:43.689 --> 00:57:45.451]  See, just everything's a suspicion.
[00:57:45.491 --> 00:57:55.280]  And now, if you have bad credit, why then that will go in the private databases and when you try to buy a gun, you can't because that puts you on the terrorist watch list or the criminal watch list.
[00:57:55.440 --> 00:57:56.802]  I mean, this is admitted.
[00:57:58.043 --> 00:57:58.664]  This is admitted.
[00:57:58.704 --> 00:57:59.484]  This is the new freedom.
[00:58:00.686 --> 00:58:02.948]  And I hope everybody enjoys it.
[00:58:02.988 --> 00:58:04.970]  Of course, the border will stay wide open.
[00:58:05.655 --> 00:58:17.204]  And they'll create a giant Pan-American Union Highway they're already building right up through Texas into Minnesota and spanning out across the country, east and west, where everyone will openly drive back and forth.
[00:58:17.304 --> 00:58:17.984]  No more borders.
[00:58:18.024 --> 00:58:18.905]  No more sovereignty.
[00:58:19.566 --> 00:58:26.591]  Already calling us the Union of American States through the FTAA, Free Trade Area of Und Americas.
[00:58:28.072 --> 00:58:29.993]  And they're announcing the new AMERO.
[00:58:30.013 --> 00:58:31.454]  They're getting us ready for our new currency.
[00:58:31.915 --> 00:58:33.176]  The average person has no idea.
[00:58:34.162 --> 00:58:40.750]  But you're going to have sensors smelling you and scanning your brain and scanning your walk.
[00:58:41.211 --> 00:58:43.413]  Well, the computer says you're LCI, Ada.
[00:58:44.515 --> 00:58:46.237]  All right, second hour of your calls.
[00:58:46.317 --> 00:58:47.699]  A ton of news straight ahead.
[00:58:47.719 --> 00:58:50.262]  Stay with us.
[00:58:51.864 --> 00:58:52.084]  Hello.
[00:58:57.856 --> 00:58:58.476]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.157 --> 00:59:00.238]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.938 --> 00:59:02.059]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.679 --> 00:59:03.520]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.260 --> 00:59:05.161]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:09.744]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.025 --> 00:59:14.088]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:24.302]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:24.603 --> 00:59:25.504]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:25.544 --> 00:59:26.765]  Central Standard Time.
[00:59:26.785 --> 00:59:29.969]  We're here live, back from 9 to midnight, already into the second hour.
[00:59:30.089 --> 00:59:32.632]  Tons of news and wide open phones today.
[00:59:33.253 --> 00:59:38.740]  Man tasered in hospital bed, forced to give urine sample while being totally restrained and tied down.
[00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:39.561]  He just refused?
[00:59:40.427 --> 00:59:46.732]  And so now, if you don't, I guess, urinate on demand, they torture you, and the police are acting like this is normalcy.
[00:59:47.032 --> 00:59:54.378]  So I want to go over some of the past torture of Christians and conservatives in this country, where the police break men and women's arms and say, we're allowed to.
[00:59:54.398 --> 01:00:01.064]  And of course, you've seen the footage of them dumping mace or pepper spray in people's eyes, who block logging roads.
[01:00:01.084 --> 01:00:02.625]  I mean, this is torture.
[01:00:02.745 --> 01:00:06.328]  It's totally criminal, but they're just saying they can do it and doing it.
[01:00:07.091 --> 01:00:08.552]  So we'll get into that.
[01:00:08.653 --> 01:00:10.975]  Also, Charles Manson clears Ted Bundy of murder.
[01:00:11.495 --> 01:00:14.218]  That's our sarcastic headline over an Associated Press article.
[01:00:14.558 --> 01:00:15.039]  Probe.
[01:00:15.439 --> 01:00:19.743]  Leaders didn't order prison abuse, and it was probed by Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:00:20.644 --> 01:00:25.989]  Terror confessions on TV grip Baghdad at the Running Man TV show our government's producing over there.
[01:00:26.886 --> 01:00:34.910]  That's just some of what is coming up in this hour, plus more on the fake capture of Saddam becoming more and more mainstream news.
[01:00:35.791 --> 01:00:37.792]  Let's talk to Gary in Pennsylvania.
[01:00:37.852 --> 01:00:38.452]  Gary, welcome.
[01:00:38.492 --> 01:00:38.952]  Go ahead.
[01:00:39.312 --> 01:00:39.793]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:41.253]  Thank you for taking my phone call.
[01:00:41.273 --> 01:00:41.834]  Thanks for calling.
[01:00:42.154 --> 01:00:52.079]  And I have a couple items that happened in the news the last few weeks that really brings about a realization of globalization in our legal system.
[01:00:52.791 --> 01:00:56.716]  One where Bush has commuted the death sentence of 500 illegal aliens.
[01:00:57.357 --> 01:00:59.860]  And his reason was international law.
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:03.905]  Well, yeah, because Mexico has banned the death penalty.
[01:01:03.925 --> 01:01:05.867]  They just beat you to death in your cell instead.
[01:01:05.887 --> 01:01:07.930]  I'm against the death penalty 100%.
[01:01:09.178 --> 01:01:16.244]  But the fact that they're doing this for international reasons is basically we're pulling in international law into our law.
[01:01:16.924 --> 01:01:28.093]  Well, the Supreme Court has said in the last few years, a bunch of the justices, that we follow, above any Congress, the President, we follow international rulings.
[01:01:29.381 --> 01:01:29.602]  Yes.
[01:01:29.742 --> 01:01:30.563]  Totally.
[01:01:31.224 --> 01:01:32.345]  What's your kangaroo in the courts?
[01:01:32.385 --> 01:01:33.126]  Go ahead.
[01:01:33.166 --> 01:01:44.320]  Yeah, and their Supreme Court decision to not execute minors in the opinion written by Sandra Day O'Connor, she did mention it was international pressures or concerns
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:51.161]  That was the basis of them reversing this 1989 decision they had made.
[01:01:51.301 --> 01:01:52.301]  They're serious about this.
[01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:56.742]  If they're going to have world government, they've got to have world law and world judiciary.
[01:01:57.182 --> 01:01:58.343]  And that's what's amazing.
[01:01:58.383 --> 01:02:03.463]  We're totally going to lose our sovereignty if everything is dictated by international law.
[01:02:03.483 --> 01:02:10.025]  Well, according to the neocons on talk radio, there's no world government, even as Bush goes to these summits and openly says it.
[01:02:11.645 --> 01:02:11.985]  And that
[01:02:12.785 --> 01:02:13.705]  That's about what I had to say.
[01:02:13.745 --> 01:02:15.926]  I really appreciate you letting me get my word on it.
[01:02:15.946 --> 01:02:16.986]  I appreciate your call, Gary.
[01:02:17.026 --> 01:02:17.806]  Those were good points.
[01:02:18.246 --> 01:02:19.106]  Scott in Texas.
[01:02:19.166 --> 01:02:19.826]  Scott, welcome.
[01:02:21.847 --> 01:02:22.227]  Hello.
[01:02:22.947 --> 01:02:27.508]  Yesterday, when you were reading that article from Tim Baldwin.
[01:02:28.408 --> 01:02:29.428]  Chuck Baldwin.
[01:02:29.448 --> 01:02:30.768]  Chuck Baldwin, I mean, yeah.
[01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:33.949]  Anyway, so I went to News and Views, and I was just checking out their site.
[01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:42.090]  Anyway, towards the bottom of it, there's a guy named Dr. James Hauenstein who has an article on Codex Alimentarius.
[01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:44.271]  Which I had no idea what that was.
[01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:48.093]  Yeah, that's the system by law basically banning our vitamins.
[01:02:48.413 --> 01:02:49.374]  Right, right.
[01:02:49.454 --> 01:02:50.434]  European law, yeah.
[01:02:50.695 --> 01:02:52.075]  Yeah, that blew my mind.
[01:02:52.095 --> 01:02:54.377]  Same subject the last caller just raised.
[01:02:54.617 --> 01:02:55.217]  Right, right.
[01:02:55.397 --> 01:03:05.924]  And to think that we are a sovereign nation is actually a misconception because it came down under GATT and the World Trade Organization.
[01:03:06.764 --> 01:03:09.286]  And, I mean, they're going to strip everything.
[01:03:09.366 --> 01:03:11.507]  And this is supposed to take effect in June, right?
[01:03:11.969 --> 01:03:15.991]  And they list maybe 20 vitamins.
[01:03:16.031 --> 01:03:18.532]  General agreements on tariffs and trade, yeah.
[01:03:19.073 --> 01:03:22.694]  Yeah, 20 vitamins that you can take, and then they leave out over 200.
[01:03:22.814 --> 01:03:26.216]  And they say that no supplements can be sold.
[01:03:26.276 --> 01:03:32.019]  So in Germany, you have to have a prescription to get vitamin C. That blows my mind.
[01:03:32.839 --> 01:03:35.582]  I mean, this just shocked me because I've been in, you know... Stay there.
[01:03:35.862 --> 01:03:36.423]  We'll talk about it.
[01:03:36.443 --> 01:03:37.824]  I want people to hear what you just brought up.
[01:03:37.944 --> 01:03:40.627]  Yeah, no, it's world government, folks.
[01:03:41.668 --> 01:03:43.670]  We'll tell you about it when we get back.
[01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:45.332]  That's another good call.
[01:03:46.052 --> 01:03:48.515]  We'll talk to Daniel and Jason and many others.
[01:03:48.535 --> 01:03:48.575]  800-259-9231.
[01:03:48.595 --> 01:03:48.855]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.802]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.042 --> 01:03:58.105]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.245 --> 01:04:02.129]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.189 --> 01:04:06.433]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.773 --> 01:04:10.557]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.637 --> 01:04:12.279]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.319 --> 01:04:12.499]  Right.
[01:04:12.779 --> 01:04:15.980]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:20.742]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.902 --> 01:04:23.944]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.124 --> 01:04:27.005]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.465 --> 01:04:33.588]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.108 --> 01:04:37.913]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:06:44.115 --> 01:06:44.696]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[01:06:54.548 --> 01:07:00.571]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.171 --> 01:07:04.213]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.175 --> 01:07:12.577]  The last two callers we were talking to were talking about global government.
[01:07:13.557 --> 01:07:20.741]  You open up USA Today, I mean, every few weeks, and it's another Supreme Court justice going, oh yeah, we ruled against the death penalty.
[01:07:21.961 --> 01:07:24.643]  For these illegal aliens because of international law.
[01:07:24.803 --> 01:07:26.465]  Oh, we're following international law.
[01:07:26.845 --> 01:07:28.446]  We're following international courts.
[01:07:28.906 --> 01:07:30.908]  The final say is the EU court.
[01:07:32.389 --> 01:07:37.893]  You watch C-SPAN and they're getting the Pan-American Union set up to the free trade area of the Americas under GATT.
[01:07:38.854 --> 01:07:40.195]  The Codex system.
[01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:50.551]  The system developed by the Germans where everything has to be prescription and where they ban literally hundreds of major vitamins.
[01:07:50.951 --> 01:07:53.532]  You have to get vitamin C by prescription over there.
[01:07:54.113 --> 01:07:57.814]  And this is all part of trade deals and treaties.
[01:07:57.834 --> 01:07:58.775]  I mean, that's global government.
[01:07:58.795 --> 01:07:59.895]  That's how the EU started.
[01:08:01.556 --> 01:08:03.517]  And it's all around us.
[01:08:05.177 --> 01:08:08.939]  And so we have to lose our rights because the rest of the world doesn't have any rights.
[01:08:10.638 --> 01:08:25.541]  And then these big global government bodies, in a few cases, will actually rule against national governments, you know, good rulings for freedom and liberty, to then make themselves look good and look like they are a final arbiter and that they're a good choice.
[01:08:26.142 --> 01:08:27.982]  It's very sophisticated what they're doing.
[01:08:28.582 --> 01:08:36.324]  But going back to the last caller that we were talking to, was that Scott in Texas?
[01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:46.436]  Scott, you were making another point about, yeah, in America they're going to try to implement this going after the over-the-counter vitamins and supplements.
[01:08:46.876 --> 01:08:50.719]  They've got all their horror stories of the quacks selling stuff, and that is true.
[01:08:51.499 --> 01:08:57.443]  But it's better to have quacks out there selling garbage than to have the government restrict it all because so much of it is great.
[01:08:57.784 --> 01:08:58.284]  Right, right.
[01:08:58.624 --> 01:09:02.827]  And, you know, this Kodak stuff, it's pretty good overall as far as,
[01:09:03.237 --> 01:09:07.620]  You know, because they regulate food and they regulate fish and things like that.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:12.424]  Again, you cannot trust a global body to do that, and it gives up our sovereignty.
[01:09:12.484 --> 01:09:13.685]  That's my point.
[01:09:14.186 --> 01:09:18.209]  They talk a good line, but it gives up our sovereignty, and it's really bad.
[01:09:18.389 --> 01:09:18.949]  Right, right.
[01:09:19.570 --> 01:09:29.017]  But hidden in this thing is this thing against supplements, and they say no supplements can be sold for preventative or therapeutic use.
[01:09:30.231 --> 01:09:38.255]  Any potency higher than RDA levels, which is pathetically low, is a drug that requires a prescription and must be produced by a drug company.
[01:09:38.275 --> 01:09:44.538]  Yeah, so if it's so many milligrams of vitamin C and it's anything above that, you can't get it.
[01:09:44.938 --> 01:09:45.118]  Right.
[01:09:45.658 --> 01:09:47.319]  Or you have to pay out the note.
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:52.262]  Well, I said years ago, they're going to be arresting people for vitamins very soon.
[01:09:52.402 --> 01:09:52.642]  Yeah.
[01:09:53.002 --> 01:09:56.724]  And the prisons will be filled with people that have bottles of vitamin C or calcium.
[01:09:56.924 --> 01:09:57.104]  Mm-hmm.
[01:09:57.719 --> 01:09:58.961]  And that's what's happening.
[01:09:59.362 --> 01:10:01.004]  By the way, folks, I'm not joking.
[01:10:01.645 --> 01:10:05.370]  You know, they're now running to arrest and ticketing Girl Scout cookie sellers.
[01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:09.316]  I mean, you know, they're arresting people who give a 10% tip instead of a 20% tip.
[01:10:10.580 --> 01:10:12.761]  They're arresting people who put their feet up on the park bench.
[01:10:12.801 --> 01:10:16.603]  They're beating up homeschoolers just because they don't like how they look.
[01:10:16.643 --> 01:10:17.703]  I mean, this is the new tyranny.
[01:10:17.963 --> 01:10:21.625]  Arrest the people for writing fiction about zombies taking over a high school.
[01:10:22.545 --> 01:10:28.467]  Yeah, you write a fiction article about zombies, it doesn't even mention your high school, and they go, well, it's a violent article, so we're going to arrest you.
[01:10:28.708 --> 01:10:29.628]  Right.
[01:10:29.828 --> 01:10:34.550]  And, you know, it says that this Codex regulations are binding internationally.
[01:10:35.171 --> 01:10:36.273]  So it doesn't matter.
[01:10:36.313 --> 01:10:38.936]  I mean, the congressman sold us out a long time ago.
[01:10:38.956 --> 01:10:40.638]  Gave up their authority, yeah.
[01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:41.019]  Right.
[01:10:41.159 --> 01:10:42.421]  Turned us over to this thing.
[01:10:42.781 --> 01:10:44.884]  So when it comes down, they're going to say, oh, I don't know.
[01:10:46.606 --> 01:10:52.354]  And so what's happening, though, is this thing is coming down, supposed to take effect in June.
[01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:56.529]  And they tried this in Canada, if you remember, back in 98.
[01:10:57.169 --> 01:10:58.330]  They tried it in 93.
[01:10:58.410 --> 01:11:02.112]  Clinton had hundreds of health food stores raided by armed police.
[01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:04.613]  You know, like they were drug dealers or something.
[01:11:04.793 --> 01:11:05.673]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[01:11:05.693 --> 01:11:06.174]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:11:06.434 --> 01:11:07.094]  I appreciate it.
[01:11:07.134 --> 01:11:08.695]  No, they're not going to get away with it.
[01:11:08.715 --> 01:11:10.796]  I mean, they can pass laws.
[01:11:10.856 --> 01:11:22.522]  Did you know that after the French Revolution, which was staged, it was actually an Illuminati action, that's mainstream history, folks, that they tried to tell them we're going to have a 10-day week
[01:11:23.743 --> 01:11:27.726]  Because, you know, they didn't like the seven days that was associated with God and Christianity.
[01:11:27.746 --> 01:11:29.027]  They were pagans.
[01:11:29.047 --> 01:11:32.129]  So they tried to go back to the old pagan ten-day calendar.
[01:11:33.010 --> 01:11:35.311]  They tried that for a few years, and people just refused.
[01:11:35.371 --> 01:11:39.715]  I mean, control freaks can just announce, you know, whatever they want.
[01:11:40.055 --> 01:11:41.956]  Let's see you try to implement it.
[01:11:42.577 --> 01:11:52.764]  That's why the Cashless Society control grid is so important, because through national sales tax, through national ID cards, through that system, they can force us to do so much.
[01:11:53.689 --> 01:12:02.055]  They've got tools of technology that will allow tyranny to develop and grow larger and more sophisticated than it ever has in history before.
[01:12:03.216 --> 01:12:04.197]  That's a two-edged sword.
[01:12:04.617 --> 01:12:15.084]  Though it enables tyranny and despotism and oppression and control and surveillance, it also allows us to effectively fight it if we have the will to take action.
[01:12:15.505 --> 01:12:16.245]  Who's up next here?
[01:12:18.507 --> 01:12:19.528]  Daniel in Indiana.
[01:12:19.548 --> 01:12:20.068]  You're on the air.
[01:12:20.108 --> 01:12:20.528]  Go ahead.
[01:12:21.109 --> 01:12:22.770]  Alex, pleasure talking with you.
[01:12:23.806 --> 01:12:27.147]  It looks like in a few short years we're going to have total peace and safety.
[01:12:28.767 --> 01:12:30.367]  Yeah, a new freedom.
[01:12:30.927 --> 01:12:31.528]  A new freedom.
[01:12:31.948 --> 01:12:40.009]  I just wanted to mention the governor out there in California and then mention a little bit about a Christian's point of view about everything that's going on.
[01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:49.611]  I followed the election of Arnold and did a little research on that and saw the photos of him having his meeting with Lord Jacob Rothschild in Europe.
[01:12:49.691 --> 01:12:51.111]  And Warren Buffett, you know.
[01:12:51.572 --> 01:12:51.792]  Yes.
[01:12:52.392 --> 01:12:53.392]  At the castle, yeah, mm-hmm.
[01:12:54.210 --> 01:12:54.750]  Exactly.
[01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:58.433]  I guess they landed by helicopter on the front lawn or whatnot.
[01:12:58.513 --> 01:13:04.617]  And this is a year before he ran for governor, and it says he's there preparing to run for governor and president.
[01:13:05.517 --> 01:13:07.098]  That's actually in the Scotsman article.
[01:13:07.619 --> 01:13:08.019]  Oh, really?
[01:13:08.519 --> 01:13:08.739]  Yeah.
[01:13:08.859 --> 01:13:13.863]  And then I guess he was seen out at the Grove once or twice also, where some of the high and mighty like to hang out.
[01:13:14.163 --> 01:13:16.564]  Yeah, Carl Rove said, you're going to run for governor, Mac.
[01:13:16.584 --> 01:13:17.385]  Uh-huh.
[01:13:17.665 --> 01:13:19.066]  That's a San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:13:19.656 --> 01:13:27.359]  Well, some of the articles, and I've seen them, like USA Today, we're talking major newspapers, and I guess this is the angle that they're coming from.
[01:13:27.839 --> 01:13:33.881]  The amendment that our founding fathers put in, that you must be... It's old-fashioned and bad, and this isn't for Arnold.
[01:13:34.381 --> 01:13:36.622]  This isn't for Arnold, it's for the other immigrants.
[01:13:37.062 --> 01:13:37.262]  Yes.
[01:13:37.862 --> 01:13:40.403]  Not even old-fashioned, but it's un-American.
[01:13:40.463 --> 01:13:41.263]  It was in big letters.
[01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:43.724]  It's un-American before that amendment.
[01:13:45.145 --> 01:13:48.506]  You've got to change Article 2, Clause 5, and again...
[01:13:49.155 --> 01:13:49.335]  Mm-hmm.
[01:14:09.803 --> 01:14:11.104]  I mean, the dirt goes on and on.
[01:14:11.124 --> 01:14:22.949]  But Dana Rohrabacher, who introduced the bill in the House, hatched in the Senate, said, told the San Jose Mercury News November 14th of last year, he said, the Republican leadership wants Arnold in 08.
[01:14:23.809 --> 01:14:25.050]  We believe he can be president.
[01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.730]  Bush Sr.
[01:14:25.770 --> 01:14:26.590]  said it weeks later.
[01:14:27.110 --> 01:14:27.911]  Houston Chronicle.
[01:14:27.951 --> 01:14:29.511]  But still, people are in denial.
[01:14:29.892 --> 01:14:30.832]  Arnold comes out and says...
[01:14:31.855 --> 01:14:33.796]  Oh, no, I've never said I want to run for president.
[01:14:34.317 --> 01:14:36.298]  I've found hundreds of articles where he's said that.
[01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:37.098]  Everybody knows that.
[01:14:37.118 --> 01:14:38.199]  It's such a public secret.
[01:14:38.639 --> 01:14:43.242]  You know, 1993 demolition man, you know, fiction, they talk about him being president.
[01:14:44.522 --> 01:14:52.067]  So, they're in total, and his wife says, oh, it's not for him, but change it for the other immigrants.
[01:14:53.147 --> 01:14:53.448]  Correct.
[01:14:54.588 --> 01:14:59.951]  Well, also, they say, they even tell us someday soon something terrible is going to happen again.
[01:15:00.472 --> 01:15:00.812]  And, uh,
[01:15:01.405 --> 01:15:04.807]  If that happened in California, it could be Arnold to the rescue.
[01:15:05.607 --> 01:15:06.547]  Wait a minute, let me stop you.
[01:15:07.108 --> 01:15:09.429]  I'm on record saying that's going to happen.
[01:15:10.029 --> 01:15:16.632]  I'm on record telling Morgenthaler Jones that, his minion that's pushing all this, his big campaign chief.
[01:15:17.492 --> 01:15:20.033]  And you're telling me what publication said this?
[01:15:20.834 --> 01:15:21.814]  Oh, no, no, I'm just saying...
[01:15:22.915 --> 01:15:24.296]  We've heard things from the government.
[01:15:24.316 --> 01:15:25.576]  It's just a matter of time.
[01:15:25.616 --> 01:15:27.057]  You know, our own government says that.
[01:15:27.117 --> 01:15:28.478]  Okay, okay.
[01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:29.558]  So they didn't say that.
[01:15:29.598 --> 01:15:30.559]  Well, that'd be really scary.
[01:15:31.439 --> 01:15:32.279]  I predict it.
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:36.781]  Arnold is going to, of course, be nearby via helicopter.
[01:15:37.301 --> 01:15:39.102]  He is going to save children.
[01:15:40.163 --> 01:15:43.424]  He is going to be commanding the response, and he's going to be valiant.
[01:15:44.170 --> 01:15:46.731]  And there's going to be a Hollywood lighting crew there, of course, on the spot.
[01:15:46.791 --> 01:15:48.451]  No one will pay attention.
[01:15:48.491 --> 01:15:49.271]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[01:15:49.991 --> 01:15:54.773]  And by the way, if you don't believe that, I have AP, Reuters, LA Times.
[01:15:55.413 --> 01:15:56.833]  A new article came out yesterday.
[01:15:57.473 --> 01:16:06.296]  Homeland Security has an office with Hollywood where they, quote, advise CSI and Threat Matrix and 24 and all these shows.
[01:16:07.136 --> 01:16:10.117]  And the government gives them grants and money for their productions.
[01:16:10.977 --> 01:16:11.797]  Do you understand that?
[01:16:13.234 --> 01:16:19.999]  And it came out that Rumsfeld hired Bruckheimer, and they actually in a day wrote the script for Saving Private Lynch.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.402]  And then suddenly five of her team went public and said, it's all lies.
[01:16:24.423 --> 01:16:32.169]  She hid in the back of the tank a Hispanic man, a member of the military, was the guy that fought off a bunch of Iraqis and died doing it.
[01:16:33.070 --> 01:16:42.437]  And then suddenly people who had been talking like that would be at a barbecue in their backyard with their family, and a man in a black mask would pop up over the back and double tap him with precision.
[01:16:43.112 --> 01:16:43.853]  You know, in the head.
[01:16:44.373 --> 01:16:47.976]  Or the person would get pulled over by police and then drown themselves in a puddle of water.
[01:16:48.337 --> 01:16:51.339]  Or be run over by a van and then backed back over.
[01:16:52.020 --> 01:16:52.540]  Five of them.
[01:16:53.521 --> 01:16:57.885]  So Lynch, and I got on there and I said, Lynch, I said, you better go public.
[01:16:57.925 --> 01:16:59.246]  This is fake or they're going to get you.
[01:16:59.266 --> 01:17:01.488]  And they're going to go, oh, the poor hero died in a car wreck.
[01:17:01.949 --> 01:17:05.372]  And man, two days later, and I'm sure she didn't hear this from me, but it was common sense.
[01:17:05.652 --> 01:17:07.293]  She came out and said, okay, it's all a fable.
[01:17:07.333 --> 01:17:07.934]  It's lies.
[01:17:08.514 --> 01:17:08.915]  I hid.
[01:17:09.722 --> 01:17:10.362]  I didn't do anything.
[01:17:10.402 --> 01:17:12.663]  The Iraqis helped me when I was in the hospital.
[01:17:12.724 --> 01:17:15.625]  The Republican Guard had been gone for two days, and they beat them up.
[01:17:16.545 --> 01:17:17.506]  And it's all a fable.
[01:17:17.566 --> 01:17:18.246]  It's just a fable.
[01:17:18.546 --> 01:17:20.007]  Bruckheimer, Bruckheimer, Bruckheimer.
[01:17:21.168 --> 01:17:22.748]  Well, it's the same thing with Saddam in the hole.
[01:17:22.848 --> 01:17:24.149]  The Kurds had him a month before.
[01:17:24.789 --> 01:17:26.670]  Then they went and just released him into a house.
[01:17:27.191 --> 01:17:31.973]  Our troops surrounded, went in, grabbed him, stuck him in a hole.
[01:17:33.010 --> 01:17:35.312]  And we'll play that clip later.
[01:17:36.512 --> 01:17:39.594]  And now Marines that were there are saying, look, it's fiction.
[01:17:40.395 --> 01:17:40.975]  It's a fable.
[01:17:41.015 --> 01:17:41.916]  It was a production.
[01:17:42.296 --> 01:17:44.077]  There was an Army production crew there.
[01:17:44.157 --> 01:17:46.118]  Yes, folks, they lie to you.
[01:17:46.979 --> 01:17:48.800]  They give you fables you're going to like.
[01:17:49.841 --> 01:17:51.282]  Boy, are you first dumb?
[01:17:51.422 --> 01:17:52.903]  I just won't believe the lie.
[01:17:53.383 --> 01:17:56.465]  So what if they did a production?
[01:17:57.606 --> 01:18:01.208]  I mean, do you like a government that produces TV shows?
[01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:02.106]  I think.
[01:18:02.126 --> 01:18:02.266]  I think.
[01:18:24.372 --> 01:18:26.572]  I mean, how many times do they have to lie to you?
[01:18:27.113 --> 01:18:29.913]  How many times do they have to do Hollywood productions?
[01:18:30.053 --> 01:18:33.734]  Wag the dog garbage for you to understand its control.
[01:18:34.994 --> 01:18:35.734]  How many times?
[01:18:38.495 --> 01:18:48.717]  I want to get into a man tasered in a hospital bed, forced to give a urine sample while he was chained down, strapped down, and I want to get into the fake Iraq situation with Saddam, and I'll take your call.
[01:18:48.737 --> 01:18:49.157]  Stay with us.
[01:18:55.333 --> 01:18:57.675]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.995 --> 01:18:59.015]  The real money folks.
[01:19:02.297 --> 01:19:04.239]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:19:04.719 --> 01:19:05.639]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:19:05.679 --> 01:19:07.180]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:07.641]  A 5% increase.
[01:19:08.241 --> 01:19:10.582]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:19:10.642 --> 01:19:13.864]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:19:23.556 --> 01:19:29.179]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[01:19:29.799 --> 01:19:32.840]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:19:54.501 --> 01:19:56.983]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:57.703 --> 01:20:02.927]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:20:03.787 --> 01:20:10.672]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:20:11.732 --> 01:20:20.258]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:20:21.271 --> 01:20:21.371]  516-8736.
[01:20:21.391 --> 01:20:21.651]  That's 1-800-516-8736.

[01:20:55.132 --> 01:20:56.173]  The war on terrorism.
[01:20:56.493 --> 01:20:59.274]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:20:59.554 --> 01:21:03.695]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:21:04.135 --> 01:21:04.935]  So what do you do?
[01:21:04.955 --> 01:21:09.837]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:21:10.337 --> 01:21:12.459]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:27.653]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:21:27.693 --> 01:21:34.760]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:21:54.364 --> 01:21:55.525]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:55.786 --> 01:22:00.791]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:22:01.051 --> 01:22:03.654]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:03.854 --> 01:22:12.403]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:22:12.763 --> 01:22:21.208]  AquaNorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[01:23:03.852 --> 01:23:08.357]  All right, I want to go to your calls.
[01:23:08.377 --> 01:23:13.342]  We've got Fred in Germany and all these other people calling in, but I've got to get to this news.
[01:23:14.583 --> 01:23:16.525]  I've got to get to man tasered in hospital bed.
[01:23:16.545 --> 01:23:17.366]  I mean, this is torture.
[01:23:17.866 --> 01:23:19.067]  And it just shows the mindset.
[01:23:19.088 --> 01:23:20.429]  This is such an important article.
[01:23:21.027 --> 01:23:21.307]  Hello, sir.
[01:23:21.347 --> 01:23:21.988]  You disagree.
[01:23:22.028 --> 01:23:23.949]  You say it's easy to get vitamins in Germany.
[01:23:50.347 --> 01:23:51.628]  Yeah, it's not a problem at all.
[01:23:52.428 --> 01:24:03.076]  Well, I know that under this codex, they're going to try to restrict them, and I've had other Germans, it's been in the news, I mean, it's basically licensed through the government and restricted what dosage and things it can be.
[01:24:03.116 --> 01:24:06.858]  I believe that that is what we were talking about, and then that will definitely happen here.
[01:24:06.898 --> 01:24:11.261]  I mean, Clinton tried to raid health food stores, but, I mean, fill me in.
[01:24:11.301 --> 01:24:11.802]  You're there.
[01:24:13.143 --> 01:24:14.864]  Well, it's not a problem.
[01:24:14.904 --> 01:24:16.285]  What you say about possibly...
[01:24:16.877 --> 01:24:21.020]  Controlling dosages could be correct, but that sort of thing happens anyway.
[01:24:22.461 --> 01:24:23.041]  No, it doesn't.
[01:24:23.121 --> 01:24:30.126]  Once they start that... No, I mean, if you go out and you buy some vitamin pills, there's a set amount of dosage in there.
[01:24:30.306 --> 01:24:31.567]  There's a recommended amount.
[01:24:31.967 --> 01:24:34.829]  Each country, I believe, has a different recommended amount.
[01:24:34.849 --> 01:24:36.951]  But they don't let you go above the recommended.
[01:24:38.191 --> 01:24:40.153]  You could always buy twice as much.
[01:24:41.414 --> 01:24:45.196]  The point is, it's regulatory systems coming in.
[01:24:46.057 --> 01:24:46.217]  Yeah.
[01:24:47.719 --> 01:24:50.361]  And it's getting worse, is the point.
[01:24:50.441 --> 01:24:51.041]  I believe you.
[01:24:51.121 --> 01:24:56.384]  What's very interesting about Germany is that it's a highly regulated country.
[01:24:56.765 --> 01:24:57.505]  Very regulated.
[01:24:58.586 --> 01:25:01.607]  And it's not a country that I actually feel is particularly free.
[01:25:02.928 --> 01:25:05.910]  Although you can talk about things and you can do anything you want.
[01:25:06.010 --> 01:25:08.732]  I've never really been stopped by the police here.
[01:25:09.692 --> 01:25:16.997]  They have things like ID cards, but they're mostly used by businesses to identify you, rather than the police stopping you and...
[01:25:18.193 --> 01:25:19.174]  Wanting to see them.
[01:25:20.975 --> 01:25:23.136]  Well, yeah, they self-regulate themselves.
[01:25:23.216 --> 01:25:24.236]  Finland's really bad.
[01:25:24.697 --> 01:25:26.818]  Let's say more controlling than Germany by far.
[01:25:27.758 --> 01:25:37.143]  But did you hear about the article where the woman was a 25-year-old computer programmer and they were going to make her be a prostitute but then they backed off of it?
[01:25:39.365 --> 01:25:41.246]  Is this from the employment agencies?
[01:25:41.526 --> 01:25:41.886]  Yeah.
[01:25:42.767 --> 01:25:45.868]  Yeah, I remember seeing something on TV about this.
[01:25:45.948 --> 01:25:47.149]  I think this is more a case of
[01:25:48.095 --> 01:25:53.056]  They're not going to be pushed into this.
[01:25:53.676 --> 01:25:55.616]  It was something that was available.
[01:25:55.636 --> 01:25:56.777]  No, they were threatening.
[01:25:56.817 --> 01:26:03.018]  No, no, it was in the news at first until they backed off saying, no, we don't make a moral judgment on this and either you take this job.
[01:26:03.578 --> 01:26:05.238]  She said, I'll be a waitress.
[01:26:05.718 --> 01:26:09.739]  They said, no, you take this job and we're going to yank your unemployment.
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:13.760]  I find it hard to believe.
[01:26:14.944 --> 01:26:16.485]  I found it hard to believe.
[01:26:16.866 --> 01:26:18.607]  No, but they did back off of it.
[01:26:19.148 --> 01:26:19.388]  Yeah.
[01:26:19.548 --> 01:26:21.770]  But I was just getting your take from Germany on that.
[01:26:21.810 --> 01:26:22.530]  So are you German?
[01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.153]  I am, but I grew up in the UK.
[01:26:25.173 --> 01:26:26.834]  How long have you been listening?
[01:26:28.115 --> 01:26:29.916]  About six weeks.
[01:26:29.977 --> 01:26:32.639]  Well, it's good to have you on board with us.
[01:26:32.659 --> 01:26:35.321]  Can I say something?
[01:26:35.341 --> 01:26:36.902]  There's a bureaucracy here.
[01:26:37.002 --> 01:26:37.983]  It's very hard-nosed.
[01:26:39.184 --> 01:26:41.446]  So what you're saying may have come from this.
[01:26:41.706 --> 01:26:43.668]  And they also have a tendency to lie.
[01:26:45.738 --> 01:26:50.642]  No, no, that's what it was.
[01:26:50.723 --> 01:26:56.008]  The agency was saying you've got to do this and then when she complained to the government above that they said of course you don't have to.
[01:26:56.248 --> 01:26:59.831]  The point is that the bureaucrats are trying to do that.
[01:27:00.712 --> 01:27:03.415]  Yeah.
[01:27:03.435 --> 01:27:09.040]  Another thing over here is, which the Germans themselves don't really understand, is that
[01:27:10.069 --> 01:27:12.011]  They just have an elected dictatorship here.
[01:27:12.831 --> 01:27:15.693]  Every four or five years the people can go out and vote.
[01:27:16.654 --> 01:27:23.560]  Because of the way the electoral system is here, it's actually not really possible to remove a politician.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.403]  Because when they vote, they vote for a politician and a party.
[01:27:27.423 --> 01:27:30.405]  So one way or the other, the politician will get back in.
[01:27:30.425 --> 01:27:32.727]  Let me ask you a final question.
[01:27:33.687 --> 01:27:39.390]  Andres Vomulo, he was in the parliament there as the defense chief.
[01:27:39.510 --> 01:27:41.211]  He was the head technology minister.
[01:27:42.032 --> 01:27:42.732]  We've had him on.
[01:27:43.052 --> 01:27:48.035]  Clearly, it's impossible for the official story of 9-11 to be based in reality.
[01:27:48.376 --> 01:27:50.177]  He points his finger at the CIA.
[01:27:50.277 --> 01:27:50.917]  Are you aware of that?
[01:27:50.937 --> 01:27:54.499]  I actually read this from your site.
[01:27:56.460 --> 01:28:01.183]  Yeah, you can listen to the interview we had with him, but it was also under Spiegel and several other publications.
[01:28:02.014 --> 01:28:03.555]  Is the average German aware of that?
[01:28:04.615 --> 01:28:05.316]  It's unlikely.
[01:28:06.116 --> 01:28:08.397]  It was the best-selling book in Germany for about six months.
[01:28:09.898 --> 01:28:11.378]  I've never heard anybody mention it.
[01:28:11.678 --> 01:28:16.080]  And it's also very unlikely that the Germans would believe it.
[01:28:17.721 --> 01:28:19.662]  Well, it was the best-seller.
[01:28:21.903 --> 01:28:25.305]  Like I say, I haven't heard anybody talk about it.
[01:28:25.345 --> 01:28:26.345]  And people here also...
[01:28:29.468 --> 01:28:31.890]  Unlikely to talk about those kind of things.
[01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:32.871]  They just clam up.
[01:28:34.231 --> 01:28:35.292]  Keep to themselves.
[01:28:35.312 --> 01:28:36.673]  Recipe for enslavement.
[01:28:37.073 --> 01:28:38.074]  Well, you didn't clam up.
[01:28:38.114 --> 01:28:38.894]  Thanks for calling.
[01:28:43.938 --> 01:28:44.858]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.338 --> 01:28:46.940]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:50.542]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.610 --> 01:28:55.290]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[01:28:55.490 --> 01:28:57.511]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[01:28:57.711 --> 01:28:58.391]  Prepare yourself.
[01:28:58.551 --> 01:29:02.251]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[01:29:02.392 --> 01:29:08.152]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.
[01:29:08.192 --> 01:29:09.573]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[01:29:09.753 --> 01:29:12.353]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[01:29:12.493 --> 01:29:14.073]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[01:29:14.314 --> 01:29:17.154]  Get your free book The Bible Says by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[01:29:17.214 --> 01:29:17.934]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[01:29:23.602 --> 01:29:23.962]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:29:53.587 --> 01:29:59.832]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:29:59.972 --> 01:30:06.137]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.417 --> 01:30:14.844]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.104 --> 01:30:22.130]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.410 --> 01:30:27.253]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.453 --> 01:30:32.877]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.197 --> 01:30:36.299]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:44.585]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:44.625 --> 01:30:45.205]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:55.551 --> 01:31:01.054]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.454 --> 01:31:05.696]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.916 --> 01:31:12.959]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.339 --> 01:31:19.441]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.581 --> 01:31:20.802]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.982 --> 01:31:21.463]  We're good to go.
[01:31:37.922 --> 01:31:41.065]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:31:41.085 --> 01:31:41.445]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.465 --> 01:31:41.505]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.525 --> 01:31:42.686]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.926 --> 01:31:43.707]  Call today.
[01:31:43.827 --> 01:31:45.868]  I want to talk about the psychological warming
[01:32:07.998 --> 01:32:08.819]  That we're witnessing.
[01:32:09.459 --> 01:32:18.366]  I mean, we really are these creatures made by God in His image, but we pick up how we behave and how we act.
[01:32:18.606 --> 01:32:23.289]  We're social animals, as they can call us.
[01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:34.197]  By animal, I mean similar in our group politics to the way dogs behave.
[01:32:34.693 --> 01:32:38.977]  You know, the dominant dogs and the other dogs seem to emulate and mimic what they do.
[01:32:40.077 --> 01:32:49.105]  I don't mean to get off into sociology and animal psychology, but the point is that if they put on TV the sharp, cool people, the leaders,
[01:32:49.824 --> 01:32:54.107]  Torturing and killing and slaughtering and torturing people's children.
[01:32:54.467 --> 01:33:00.632]  And a lot of weak-minded people who don't have any moral compass that weren't taught it growing up were taught a moral relativist view.
[01:33:00.952 --> 01:33:09.038]  They can now have their morals that they didn't even have replaced with a sadistic serial killer type mentality.
[01:33:09.648 --> 01:33:16.531]  So I want to illustrate the connection between the globalists and serial killers and how they're giving us their takes through the media.
[01:33:16.851 --> 01:33:18.491]  So that's coming up, and then of course your calls.
[01:33:18.531 --> 01:33:21.873]  But we haven't had him on probably in about six months.
[01:33:23.493 --> 01:33:30.996]  And he is the head honcho of the Genesis Communications Network and also the head honcho at Midas Resources.
[01:33:31.957 --> 01:33:35.318]  And I was talking to Ted last week, and I said, you know, we haven't had you on the air in forever.
[01:33:35.945 --> 01:33:37.546]  We ought to get you up on the broadcast.
[01:33:37.606 --> 01:33:45.610]  He's got a couple free offers today for information, really powerful info, and something that I believe in, silver.
[01:33:46.130 --> 01:33:54.675]  Silver has just been exploding in its cost over the years, but he's got a really good deal for you.
[01:33:56.036 --> 01:33:58.037]  It's a portable type of silver that...
[01:33:59.467 --> 01:34:00.729]  Is really exceptional.
[01:34:01.210 --> 01:34:04.254]  And so, Ted Anderson, good to have you on with us for a few minutes.
[01:34:04.534 --> 01:34:06.196]  Well, thanks for having me up again, Alex.
[01:34:06.236 --> 01:34:09.681]  You know, it has been a while since I've been up here, and there's been a lot of things going on.
[01:34:09.721 --> 01:34:12.284]  Everybody's watching the silver market go up there again.
[01:34:12.364 --> 01:34:13.485]  Now it's at the $750 level again.
[01:34:14.827 --> 01:34:22.531]  Oh, by the way, thanks for telling me to buy gold three or four years ago, because it's basically my investments doubled, and I wouldn't have gotten that in the stock market, Ted.
[01:34:22.971 --> 01:34:24.152]  No, no, you sure wouldn't have.
[01:34:24.212 --> 01:34:24.933]  It would have been real tough.
[01:34:24.953 --> 01:34:27.274]  But I'm not selling even if gold goes down or back up.
[01:34:27.694 --> 01:34:28.915]  I'm keeping it as insurance.
[01:34:29.255 --> 01:34:30.195]  Well, I agree.
[01:34:30.255 --> 01:34:31.696]  I think you ought to hold on to that, Alex.
[01:34:31.736 --> 01:34:38.460]  I mean, obviously right now we're watching the Euro dollar get stronger, the United States dollar is getting weaker, bankruptcies are skyrocketing.
[01:34:39.260 --> 01:34:45.304]  There's just so many things that are happening in today's economy that I know everybody's concerned.
[01:34:45.344 --> 01:34:59.052]  I can pick up the regular local paper here and they're talking about the problems with the national debt and the credit card debts and the mortgages that have just gone skyrockets.
[01:35:00.712 --> 01:35:08.637]  The savings was at about 6% before the Federal Reserve System lowered the interest rates here recently and now savings are down to about 1% because everybody
[01:35:09.958 --> 01:35:21.228]  The average American, it's about what, 65% of the country now, over half, on average, you're looking at about $1.20 spent for every dollar coming in.
[01:35:22.293 --> 01:35:23.373]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[01:35:23.514 --> 01:35:29.136]  Everybody's recommending that you have some silver, some of the old silver dimes, quarters, and halves on hand.
[01:35:29.536 --> 01:35:35.899]  They call it junk silver a lot of the time, but when you pick up that junk silver, the United States government wants to have forms filled out.
[01:35:36.259 --> 01:35:38.800]  There's a 6045 form and this kind of stuff.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:47.984]  Rarely do I run into this, but we ran into a good buy on some dimes, which are brilliant uncirculated, and these bags are going for $2,208 per bag.
[01:35:51.295 --> 01:36:01.461]  And what they are is they're dimes that have never been circulated, and the reason why that's good to have is because they don't fit into that junk silver category where you have to give up all that paperwork.
[01:36:01.521 --> 01:36:04.062]  And for those that don't know, folks, back then it was silver.
[01:36:04.082 --> 01:36:08.365]  Now it's a light coating of, like, zinc, and it wears off in a week.
[01:36:08.685 --> 01:36:17.870]  This is real silver that you can take in and, you know, cash in for whatever, or if times even get worse and there's a depression or whatever, that silver will only explode in price.
[01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.850]  Well, yeah, that's right.
[01:36:18.891 --> 01:36:28.856]  These bags of Brilliant Uncirculated are dated back previous to 1964 when the United States was issuing its currency with real silver.
[01:36:28.916 --> 01:36:33.878]  So, I mean, those of you who have been thinking about a silver position, this is the perfect time for you to get involved.
[01:36:33.919 --> 01:36:39.942]  And for 2208, you know, I mean, I realize that some people that's a stretch, but it's a good time to be getting in.
[01:36:39.982 --> 01:36:41.202]  If you can afford to do it, that 2208...
[01:36:42.702 --> 01:36:43.722]  For a bag of silver.
[01:36:43.742 --> 01:36:45.983]  Well, how much has silver gone up in the last three years?
[01:36:46.123 --> 01:36:49.843]  Well, silver was trading in that $3 range, and so silver has doubled.
[01:36:50.624 --> 01:36:52.084]  Right now you're at currently $7.50.
[01:36:52.244 --> 01:36:55.124]  You told me to buy silver, and I bought just a little bit.
[01:36:55.164 --> 01:36:56.105]  I should have got more.
[01:36:56.465 --> 01:37:06.907]  Well, you know, the thing is you need to have some of that silver in because silver is what you're going to need to have when it comes time to buy groceries, and, you know, the economy is doing really terrible.
[01:37:06.927 --> 01:37:08.827]  Ted, what type of advice are you giving me?
[01:37:10.124 --> 01:37:17.367]  You're telling me about investments that have doubled, and I'd rather go with the stock market that's, what, down about 5% right now?
[01:37:17.607 --> 01:37:22.969]  Well, even the stock market, the people have been piling a lot of money into real estate, too, and that bubble's going to burst as well.
[01:37:23.009 --> 01:37:26.910]  I think that you're already seeing that down in the Austin, Texas area.
[01:37:27.330 --> 01:37:29.691]  Across the United States, I expect to see that, too.
[01:37:30.711 --> 01:37:49.397]  You know, the future, the International Forecaster talks about this whole economic situation, and I do have the current issue, the March issue of the Forecaster, but then I also, a while ago I offered this, and I would like to offer it again because there's a lot of people that don't have it.
[01:37:49.777 --> 01:37:59.080]  I have that Oh Yeah book, which goes back to 1929, 1930, and it gives you an economic review of what was going on during the Depression of the 1930s and coming up to that.
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:07.570]  It's this, you know, what you need to do is you need to educate yourself in order to know what's going on in the marketplace so you can make good decisions.
[01:38:07.610 --> 01:38:12.276]  There definitely is a solid reason to buy... No, I should have invested in the stock market and lost money.
[01:38:12.697 --> 01:38:15.761]  Well, Alex Jones, you know, why would one of the most...
[01:38:16.844 --> 01:38:29.002]  Credible investors out there, Warren Buffett, have such a huge supply of silver, and the reason for that is because... Well, I'm not going to pay attention to that, and that he made $3 billion off his silver and dollar dumping.
[01:38:29.383 --> 01:38:30.184]  I think I'll just...
[01:38:31.258 --> 01:38:32.259]  I think I just won't buy any.
[01:38:32.799 --> 01:38:33.019]  Right.
[01:38:33.059 --> 01:38:36.020]  Well, obviously, he's a lot smarter.
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:36.901]  He's an insider.
[01:38:36.961 --> 01:38:38.061]  He knows what's going on.
[01:38:38.742 --> 01:38:44.104]  The above-ground supply of silver is real short in supply, and right now is a great time to be getting it.
[01:38:44.144 --> 01:38:46.645]  So here's what I have, and this is what I'm offering.
[01:38:46.685 --> 01:38:48.926]  Now, first of all, the brochures are free.
[01:38:48.946 --> 01:38:49.867]  You can just have them.
[01:38:50.627 --> 01:38:51.588]  Actually, they're not brochures.
[01:38:51.668 --> 01:38:55.670]  It's the full newsletter, the full March newsletter of the International Forecaster.
[01:38:55.690 --> 01:38:56.610]  How many pages are up?
[01:38:56.890 --> 01:38:59.451]  Well, it's usually about 28 pages.
[01:38:59.511 --> 01:39:03.332]  This time it is 28 pages, and it's just a lot of in-depth information.
[01:39:03.392 --> 01:39:04.712]  His information is excellent.
[01:39:05.153 --> 01:39:07.393]  So you're offering that free if folks want to call?
[01:39:07.653 --> 01:39:15.396]  And the Oh Yeah book, which is the compilation of what happened in the 1929-1930 era.
[01:39:16.116 --> 01:39:17.136]  Why study history?
[01:39:17.156 --> 01:39:18.357]  Why not just watch TV?
[01:39:18.837 --> 01:39:22.058]  Well, that's what people are doing right now.
[01:39:22.098 --> 01:39:23.338]  But here's how you get it, Alex.
[01:39:23.938 --> 01:39:24.479]  You dial 1-800-
[01:39:26.357 --> 01:39:27.199]  1-800-686-2237 That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:39:34.412 --> 01:39:37.814]  Ask for the Oh Yeah book and get the International Forecaster.
[01:39:37.854 --> 01:39:38.315]  They're yours.
[01:39:38.335 --> 01:39:40.836]  They're not an obligation to buy the silver.
[01:39:41.217 --> 01:39:43.558]  I recommend that you do get the silver at 2208.
[01:39:44.459 --> 01:39:47.141]  You've been watching what's going on in the gold and silver market.
[01:39:47.161 --> 01:39:48.221]  We've been talking about it.
[01:39:48.241 --> 01:39:51.464]  What about people that can't buy a whole bag?
[01:39:51.884 --> 01:39:53.445]  How many dimes are in that bag?
[01:39:53.605 --> 01:39:57.127]  Well, this would be 2,500 dimes in the bag.
[01:39:57.147 --> 01:39:59.589]  And yeah, you can buy smaller increments if you want to.
[01:39:59.929 --> 01:40:02.411]  And if you want to buy larger increments, you can as well.
[01:40:02.991 --> 01:40:07.292]  2,500 pure silver or almost pure silver dimes.
[01:40:07.332 --> 01:40:08.192]  Yep, that's right.
[01:40:08.533 --> 01:40:09.813]  They're 90% pure.
[01:40:09.833 --> 01:40:12.534]  That's the way they made them here in the United States.
[01:40:12.674 --> 01:40:16.615]  And as long as they're dated previous to 1964, and they gleam.
[01:40:16.635 --> 01:40:17.835]  They're brilliant uncirculated.
[01:40:17.855 --> 01:40:18.815]  They've never been used.
[01:40:19.255 --> 01:40:20.636]  All right, well, folks, give them a call.
[01:40:21.156 --> 01:40:22.236]  Give that number out again, Ted.
[01:40:22.356 --> 01:40:23.436]  Well, you can reach us at 1-800-686-
[01:40:26.916 --> 01:40:29.078]  2237.
[01:40:27.437 --> 01:40:29.078]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:40:29.118 --> 01:40:33.422]  And I suggest that you call today.
[01:40:33.682 --> 01:40:36.545]  The time is now to get into this precious metals thing.
[01:40:36.805 --> 01:40:38.547]  How many bags of those dimes you got?
[01:40:38.627 --> 01:40:41.009]  Right now, currently, I believe I have about 20.
[01:40:42.702 --> 01:40:43.603]  That's available to me.
[01:40:43.623 --> 01:40:44.324]  20 people.
[01:40:44.484 --> 01:40:44.865]  All right.
[01:40:45.145 --> 01:40:46.086]  That won't last long.
[01:40:46.106 --> 01:40:46.286]  800-686-2237.
[01:40:46.346 --> 01:40:53.755]  And Ted, I want to thank you for the millions of dollars you've put into this network in the last six years.
[01:40:54.135 --> 01:41:01.023]  I want to commend you for founding the GCN Radio Network and never censoring me and supporting the First Amendment.
[01:41:01.323 --> 01:41:02.425]  And we're getting so many...
[01:41:02.985 --> 01:41:03.625]  New affiliates.
[01:41:03.645 --> 01:41:06.566]  A new affiliate every week now, on average, and that's really good for us.
[01:41:06.966 --> 01:41:09.527]  A lot of big markets, and you've got a great team up there.
[01:41:09.987 --> 01:41:11.628]  And, Ted, I want to salute you.
[01:41:11.848 --> 01:41:12.748]  God bless you, my friend.
[01:41:13.048 --> 01:41:19.551]  Thanks a lot, Alex, and I really appreciate having up, and I really appreciate the listeners who have been supporting us so much over the years.
[01:41:19.671 --> 01:41:20.051]  You bet.
[01:41:20.111 --> 01:41:20.711]  God bless you.
[01:41:21.331 --> 01:41:28.674]  Yeah, Ted has literally taken every dime of property he gets, literally, if you only knew, and put it into this network.
[01:41:30.319 --> 01:41:35.542]  It's something special, and give them a call, 800-686-2237.
[01:41:36.803 --> 01:41:39.364]  All right, listen, I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:41:39.644 --> 01:41:44.947]  I took a lot in the first hour, some in the second hour, but I've got to cover this news, and then we'll go to your calls.
[01:41:45.227 --> 01:41:51.831]  We've got an hour and 17 minutes left in the broadcast, so plenty of time to cover it all.
[01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.702]  I know some stations only carry two hours of the show, and that's fine.
[01:41:56.022 --> 01:42:02.566]  Too bad they'll miss out on some of the other news, but it's all on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com if you miss any of it.
[01:42:03.486 --> 01:42:05.027]  I wanted to go over this, though, all right?
[01:42:05.047 --> 01:42:07.569]  I've been mentioning it all day.
[01:42:07.929 --> 01:42:12.752]  Man tasered in hospital bed, forced to give urine sample.
[01:42:13.673 --> 01:42:17.195]  And they say that he was arrested for suspicion of drug use.
[01:42:19.611 --> 01:42:20.471]  Drug suspect.
[01:42:20.511 --> 01:42:22.052]  No drugs, just we think you're on drugs.
[01:42:22.212 --> 01:42:40.001]  And so they took him to the hospital, forcibly did a urine test, and it says, handcuffed him and strapped him down with leather straps, completely restrained him, and forcibly were going to put a catheter in him because he said, this is the Associated Press, I can't use the bathroom.
[01:42:41.302 --> 01:42:43.062]  And so, I mean, it's painful, a catheter.
[01:42:43.463 --> 01:42:45.784]  I've had surgery before, and it's not fun.
[01:42:46.924 --> 01:42:48.145]  And when I broke my leg,
[01:42:48.999 --> 01:42:49.860]  And have a pin put in it.
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:53.822]  But to make a long story short, that's really torture right there.
[01:42:53.862 --> 01:42:59.726]  You know, to stop cocaine that was sold in Coca-Cola on store shelves, and nobody really used it.
[01:43:00.046 --> 01:43:05.990]  A few million people did, and they made it illegal, and tens of millions used it, and the people that deal the drugs made it illegal to boost prices.
[01:43:06.010 --> 01:43:07.250]  A whole other side issue.
[01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:14.535]  But to stop cocaine that our government ships in, everybody knows it, we're now going to arrest people under suspicion, out of their car...
[01:43:15.626 --> 01:43:17.587]  And take them and chain them down.
[01:43:18.028 --> 01:43:21.430]  And they say the cop, when he refused, jumped on him.
[01:43:21.470 --> 01:43:22.691]  The cop is proud of this.
[01:43:23.492 --> 01:43:32.378]  This officer, Linen Comp, jumps on his chest, says, I jumped on him, he still refused, and so I tasered him twice.
[01:43:34.119 --> 01:43:37.641]  And then he complied and urinated for us.
[01:43:39.002 --> 01:43:39.623]  Now, look.
[01:43:40.083 --> 01:43:41.164]  This is hidden in plain view.
[01:43:41.264 --> 01:43:43.946]  In the article, the article...
[01:43:45.072 --> 01:43:50.696]  Acts like it's normal and good, and acts like there's no problem with it.
[01:43:51.136 --> 01:43:54.438]  It's just pure insanity, hidden in plain view.
[01:43:55.358 --> 01:43:56.539]  Now, what are you more afraid of?
[01:43:56.579 --> 01:43:59.881]  Some poor idiot who may be using a narcotic?
[01:44:01.382 --> 01:44:09.127]  Or are you worried more about a government that wears a black mask and is building giant prisons everywhere, who SWAT teams your house looking for drugs?
[01:44:10.147 --> 01:44:13.589]  Are you more worried about a government that will taser you while you're chained down?
[01:44:13.609 --> 01:44:13.889]  50,000 volts.
[01:44:15.690 --> 01:44:17.611]  Someone's dying now, and I've checked it.
[01:44:17.851 --> 01:44:19.893]  Every day, someone dies from these.
[01:44:20.673 --> 01:44:23.034]  And I'm not saying ban tasers for the cops and the citizens.
[01:44:24.295 --> 01:44:26.376]  They're a good tool if they were trained properly.
[01:44:26.416 --> 01:44:28.537]  But they're trained, use them anytime you want.
[01:44:28.597 --> 01:44:35.881]  And now, they're using them on protesters, they're using them on people who chain themselves on a logging road.
[01:44:36.462 --> 01:44:36.882]  You know what?
[01:44:36.942 --> 01:44:40.264]  Come in, cut the chain, take them to jail.
[01:44:41.278 --> 01:44:42.879]  Okay, you don't need to taser them.
[01:44:42.899 --> 01:44:50.564]  You don't need to pour, open their eyes up, and literally ground into their eyeball ounces of pepper spray.
[01:44:51.425 --> 01:44:51.945]  It's torture.
[01:44:51.985 --> 01:45:07.795]  But about a month ago, I did a special report and aired part of a documentary from the mid-90s where it shows women with babies being maced by police, priests having their arms with nunchucks wrapped around them, breaking them, and the cops go, yes, we're allowed to break your arms.
[01:45:09.187 --> 01:45:12.348]  Pro-life demonstrators peacefully sitting on the sidewalk.
[01:45:12.728 --> 01:45:13.969]  This is presentplanet.tv.
[01:45:14.009 --> 01:45:14.689]  Members can watch this.
[01:45:14.929 --> 01:45:17.670]  We actually put the report up for free for everybody, this special report.
[01:45:19.251 --> 01:45:20.651]  Breaking their arms.
[01:45:20.791 --> 01:45:22.752]  I mean, they twist it with nunchucks and then break it.
[01:45:22.792 --> 01:45:25.733]  You see the arm totally twist the other direction.
[01:45:25.793 --> 01:45:27.854]  Bones sticking out of flesh.
[01:45:28.254 --> 01:45:30.975]  Beating women so severely that they have miscarriages.
[01:45:32.236 --> 01:45:34.517]  Men having heart attacks or tortured so bad.
[01:45:34.957 --> 01:45:37.718]  Wrapping nunchucks around their arms and dragging them by them.
[01:45:39.023 --> 01:45:42.546]  Grabbing women and doing pressure points on them, choking them.
[01:45:42.967 --> 01:45:44.148]  And the cops are laughing.
[01:45:44.208 --> 01:45:47.952]  I mean, I've got them in Atlanta, L.A., Detroit, all over.
[01:45:48.512 --> 01:45:56.240]  Through 88 through 95, when they released this film, it's an Operation Rescue documentary called The Awful Truth.
[01:45:57.722 --> 01:45:58.943]  And the ACLU didn't care.
[01:45:59.003 --> 01:45:59.704]  Nobody helped them.
[01:45:59.744 --> 01:46:00.645]  Nobody got involved.
[01:46:01.605 --> 01:46:03.286]  I mean, folks, I mean savage.
[01:46:03.326 --> 01:46:05.708]  I mean close-up video right in front of the cameras.
[01:46:05.748 --> 01:46:06.388]  They don't care.
[01:46:06.769 --> 01:46:07.849]  Wrap the nunchucks around.
[01:46:07.929 --> 01:46:08.790]  I'm going to break your arm.
[01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:09.190]  You ready?
[01:46:09.510 --> 01:46:09.911]  All right.
[01:46:11.832 --> 01:46:12.773]  Big old cop.
[01:46:12.973 --> 01:46:13.493]  Boom!
[01:46:13.533 --> 01:46:15.574]  Boy, that arm is, boom, breaking.
[01:46:15.594 --> 01:46:16.935]  All right, let's get this woman up.
[01:46:16.995 --> 01:46:17.716]  Break her arm.
[01:46:17.756 --> 01:46:18.196]  Let's go.
[01:46:18.216 --> 01:46:19.057]  Boom!
[01:46:19.137 --> 01:46:19.857]  Break that arm.
[01:46:19.937 --> 01:46:21.178]  All right, get the next one ready.
[01:46:21.218 --> 01:46:21.719]  Let's go.
[01:46:22.299 --> 01:46:26.121]  And these incredible people of incredible courage still would just sit there and take it.
[01:46:26.802 --> 01:46:29.844]  That's like Christians in the Coliseum or something.
[01:46:29.864 --> 01:46:31.325]  You've got to see this to believe it.
[01:46:32.446 --> 01:46:47.499]  By the way, the DVD, and don't wait a month, folks, because we've got to get the Masters, all my films out now, but the new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State, it's only available on VHS.
[01:46:47.519 --> 01:46:49.040]  You know what I want you to do?
[01:46:49.060 --> 01:46:51.562]  I want you to buy that now, get it out to people now.
[01:46:51.602 --> 01:46:55.085]  We cannot wait to expose the terrorist star, or they may carry out more terror.
[01:46:55.325 --> 01:46:59.549]  But on the DVD, we're going to have those clips of the arm-breaking, and then connect it to Abu Ghraib.
[01:47:01.117 --> 01:47:03.918]  But the point I'm trying to make here is this has been going on for a long time.
[01:47:04.659 --> 01:47:04.979]  All right?
[01:47:06.140 --> 01:47:09.382]  I got arrested protesting a thumb scanning in 97.
[01:47:09.422 --> 01:47:13.444]  Many of you have seen that in the video, my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[01:47:15.506 --> 01:47:26.272]  And the state police were very professional, very nice, apologized for arresting me, said they weren't going to do it until they got orders from the head of DPS, who even showed up on the scene.
[01:47:28.801 --> 01:47:31.485]  And they stopped the car, took the handcuffs off.
[01:47:32.126 --> 01:47:36.091]  Mysteriously, once I got to the jail, later it disappeared off the records.
[01:47:36.612 --> 01:47:39.235]  But there was this little short red-haired jail guard.
[01:47:40.917 --> 01:47:43.320]  And when he was fingerprinting me, he said, Art, stand up against the wall.
[01:47:44.101 --> 01:47:45.563]  And he just took the back of his...
[01:47:46.601 --> 01:47:50.122]  You know, the palm of his hand and jammed it right into the back of my head.
[01:47:50.162 --> 01:47:52.402]  And my head, bam, hit the center block and bruised me.
[01:47:52.843 --> 01:47:53.643]  And he was just waiting.
[01:47:53.663 --> 01:47:54.743]  There were a couple more at the door.
[01:47:55.223 --> 01:47:57.664]  They had their clubs, and they were just waiting for me to do something.
[01:47:57.684 --> 01:47:58.884]  They probably would have killed me, folks.
[01:47:59.224 --> 01:48:01.885]  There's been, what is it now, like 31 deaths in that jail.
[01:48:02.165 --> 01:48:04.466]  People getting hung, getting their brains beat out.
[01:48:05.226 --> 01:48:13.788]  And basically, I had somebody with kind of the killer mindset there, and they wanted to hurt me bad.
[01:48:14.747 --> 01:48:17.828]  And I've had friends that have gone into that jail from protest, and they do beat you.
[01:48:18.228 --> 01:48:22.170]  And then we subpoena the video, and right when they get around you to torture you, the camera cuts out.
[01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:24.811]  You know, the tapes they released to the court are altered.
[01:48:25.411 --> 01:48:26.071]  This is criminal.
[01:48:27.412 --> 01:48:29.032]  So, I mean, this is what they do.
[01:48:29.052 --> 01:48:37.075]  And they took the pro-lifers to the jails and, you know, pulled their tops off and put them in front of the president and said, I'm going to throw you in, they're going to rape you.
[01:48:38.948 --> 01:48:40.849]  It's a serial killer mindset.
[01:48:41.209 --> 01:48:44.031]  Serial killers love getting in positions of power.
[01:48:44.051 --> 01:48:45.932]  They love having power over people.
[01:48:46.513 --> 01:48:49.635]  And what's happened is the elite are the same M.O.
[01:48:49.655 --> 01:48:57.900]  If you read the criminology about serial killers, Hitler was into this, Stalin was into this, Mingala...
[01:48:59.341 --> 01:49:03.885]  These are people who just enjoy death, enjoy exercising pain and power.
[01:49:04.305 --> 01:49:11.432]  And they can look totally normal, nice and calm, dress very nice, you know, the nice guy next door.
[01:49:12.573 --> 01:49:20.560]  And basically with all this torture promotion on TV where they torture people's children to get the answers, but it's okay in the end, or, you know, in...
[01:49:21.758 --> 01:49:26.601]  Boston Legal, where they break the guy's arm even though he's innocent, but at the end he's found not guilty.
[01:49:26.621 --> 01:49:29.102]  The cop is because he broke the arm because he meant well.
[01:49:29.782 --> 01:49:37.646]  The psychopaths, the serial killers, are in control, and they're selling us on their psychology.
[01:49:37.666 --> 01:49:41.708]  They're telling us it's normal, and those of us that are against it are bad.
[01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:45.310]  And it's very, very serious.
[01:49:45.330 --> 01:49:49.092]  I mean, imagine, you're chained down and they're tasering you to make you give them a sample.
[01:49:49.472 --> 01:49:50.312]  That is torture.
[01:49:50.773 --> 01:49:51.373]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.835 --> 01:49:58.157]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.357 --> 01:50:02.779]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.919 --> 01:50:07.280]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.340 --> 01:50:08.701]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.441 --> 01:50:10.422]  Can emerge.
[01:50:10.483 --> 01:50:14.707]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.767 --> 01:50:21.715]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.815 --> 01:50:23.838]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.198 --> 01:50:34.662]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.802 --> 01:50:40.204]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:53.269 --> 01:51:00.773]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:01.053 --> 01:51:11.959]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.179 --> 01:51:12.640]  We're good to go.
[01:51:28.721 --> 01:51:29.221]  That's right.
[01:51:29.381 --> 01:51:36.504]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:36.804 --> 01:51:45.548]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:45.568 --> 01:51:46.048]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:00.922]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.162 --> 01:52:03.403]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.603 --> 01:52:09.945]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:10.345 --> 01:52:10.945]  I think so.
[01:52:25.854 --> 01:52:26.194]  We're good to go.
[01:52:59.497 --> 01:53:09.103]  So what we're facing is globalists giving us basically their spirit.
[01:53:09.143 --> 01:53:10.924]  That's a good way, an example.
[01:53:11.405 --> 01:53:12.406]  I'm going to use the Bible term.
[01:53:12.446 --> 01:53:14.447]  Giving us their mindset, their worldview.
[01:53:14.827 --> 01:53:16.208]  We're being taught how to be evil.
[01:53:16.528 --> 01:53:22.592]  And look, if you don't think the general public can be taught to be evil and think it's good, look at the Aztecs killing tens of thousands of their own people.
[01:53:22.632 --> 01:53:23.313]  It was normal.
[01:53:23.333 --> 01:53:31.218]  It was normal on an appointed day to walk your five-year-old down and have them cut the five-year-old's heart out and then you'd eat parts of your five-year-old like lunch meat.
[01:53:32.119 --> 01:53:34.520]  Serial killers, psychopath demons ran things.
[01:53:34.560 --> 01:53:35.501]  They ran the society.
[01:53:35.521 --> 01:53:37.622]  It was a society of predatory control.
[01:53:37.682 --> 01:53:38.863]  The Nazis, the same thing.
[01:53:40.124 --> 01:53:40.184]  Uh...
[01:53:42.003 --> 01:53:43.324]  And the globalists know what they're doing.
[01:53:43.764 --> 01:53:45.885]  They're systematically selling us on all this.
[01:53:45.905 --> 01:53:52.088]  So the cops watch the shows where you torture the terrorists, and most of the shows now they torture someone's child to make them answer.
[01:53:52.128 --> 01:53:56.831]  They're even going further to make normal torture not look as bad.
[01:53:57.091 --> 01:54:01.673]  And they admit Homeland Security is funding and training and helping write the scripts.
[01:54:01.713 --> 01:54:02.954]  That's mainstream news.
[01:54:04.554 --> 01:54:11.837]  And so, don't be surprised when they don't answer questions, so they just openly torture you in front of news cameras and go, well, this is normal.
[01:54:12.957 --> 01:54:16.178]  You know, you're going to give us a sample, and we're going to chain you down and start tasering you.
[01:54:16.918 --> 01:54:17.759]  You didn't comply.
[01:54:17.799 --> 01:54:24.201]  I mean, if they can break Christians' arms for peacefully sitting in front of an abortuary, then they can do this to anybody.
[01:54:25.461 --> 01:54:28.242]  And I've been saying all along, a lot of Christian conservatives...
[01:54:30.581 --> 01:54:35.966]  Out there think that Bush is a second coming and think that he's just wonderful and you're in total denial.
[01:54:36.847 --> 01:54:38.328]  And you think, oh, it's all for the Arabs.
[01:54:38.348 --> 01:54:39.189]  Yeah, let's torture them.
[01:54:39.209 --> 01:54:39.889]  They're subhuman.
[01:54:39.909 --> 01:54:40.190]  They're not.
[01:54:40.210 --> 01:54:41.791]  I mean, I've heard you on the radio.
[01:54:41.851 --> 01:54:42.392]  It's sick.
[01:54:43.192 --> 01:54:45.754]  Tell this about any other group, you know, you'd be in deep trouble.
[01:54:47.056 --> 01:54:56.644]  But the only other group that the feds think all this is authorized with, well, now it's expanded into peace demonstrators and environmental activists, but it's always been the Christians.
[01:54:56.784 --> 01:54:57.605]  We've been the first.
[01:54:58.402 --> 01:54:59.562]  And the most brutalized.
[01:54:59.703 --> 01:55:00.623]  And the liberals love it.
[01:55:01.083 --> 01:55:05.065]  And so all these laws that are being put into place, when they get a Democrat in, it's going to be on you.
[01:55:06.845 --> 01:55:08.026]  And I hope you realize that.
[01:55:08.046 --> 01:55:09.566]  I hope you're very proud of what you've done.
[01:55:09.586 --> 01:55:26.493]  You know, it's funny to see Jay Sekulow fighting for the Christians decades ago, and now he's telling you the Patriot Act's good and all this is wonderful, when he's got to know full well that all the real FBI training manuals and all the stuff that's going on is being engineered and set up to go after homeschoolers and Christians and others.
[01:55:27.048 --> 01:55:30.689]  You know, they have big drills all over the country to go after the homeschoolers and their families.
[01:55:31.089 --> 01:55:32.069]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[01:55:32.089 --> 01:55:33.789]  This has been in mainstream news.
[01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:37.290]  So this is happening.
[01:55:38.290 --> 01:55:38.970]  This is real.
[01:55:39.930 --> 01:55:42.331]  So don't sweat at the airport or you may be a terrorist.
[01:55:42.391 --> 01:55:48.492]  And don't refuse a urine sample or we'll have to torture you.
[01:55:48.512 --> 01:55:52.073]  Because, you know, torture is as American as mom and apple pie.
[01:55:52.093 --> 01:55:53.393]  They actually said that on that show.
[01:55:54.835 --> 01:55:57.936]  Clip we played a few weeks ago from Boston Legal.
[01:55:58.016 --> 01:55:59.076]  Hey, torture's American.
[01:55:59.116 --> 01:55:59.756]  Torture's good.
[01:55:59.796 --> 01:56:00.336]  We love it.
[01:56:01.536 --> 01:56:03.196]  Alberto Gonzalez says it's good.
[01:56:03.376 --> 01:56:04.837]  That was all written by the government, folks.
[01:56:04.877 --> 01:56:05.477]  It's now admitted.
[01:56:06.557 --> 01:56:10.938]  They even write themselves into the scripts on TV now and tell us how good it all is.
[01:56:11.018 --> 01:56:12.178]  I mean, this is sick, folks.
[01:56:13.038 --> 01:56:14.298]  And you better be concerned about it.
[01:56:15.259 --> 01:56:23.200]  All right, before we end this hour, we'll come straight back with your calls and I'll get into all the fake newscasts and more propaganda, a bunch of news in the...
[01:56:24.298 --> 01:56:26.779]  Third hour, but first all the callers that have been patiently holding.
[01:56:27.379 --> 01:56:41.046]  But before I do that, just in the last minute of this second hour, please go to prisonplanet.com or infowars.com, peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart, order any... All my films are excellent.
[01:56:41.066 --> 01:56:45.328]  We've got a bunch of great specials going, but the new film is out two and a half hours long.
[01:56:45.928 --> 01:56:46.568]  Don't wait.
[01:56:46.768 --> 01:56:47.489]  Order it now.
[01:56:47.769 --> 01:56:48.709]  Make copies of it.
[01:56:49.069 --> 01:56:50.430]  Start getting it out to people.
[01:56:50.650 --> 01:56:52.311]  Now order multiple copies.
[01:56:53.243 --> 01:56:56.846]  Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State, my best work.
[01:56:57.686 --> 01:56:58.887]  It heads above the rest.
[01:56:59.428 --> 01:57:00.849]  I'm really proud of this film.
[01:57:00.969 --> 01:57:05.592]  A new standard of truth-seeking patriot video.
[01:57:06.793 --> 01:57:08.534]  You can call until 3 to get the new film.
[01:57:08.554 --> 01:57:09.615]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:09.835 --> 01:57:11.016]  Call right now.
[01:57:11.036 --> 01:57:11.096]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:22.185 --> 01:57:28.168]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:57:29.769 --> 01:57:32.030]  Or you can watch it online at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:57:32.910 --> 01:57:33.851]  Really, this isn't hype.
[01:57:33.951 --> 01:57:34.571]  It's powerful.
[01:57:34.611 --> 01:57:36.492]  You need to see it and share it.
[01:57:36.512 --> 01:57:40.254]  Stay with us as we forge ahead and stay the course.
[01:57:43.816 --> 01:57:44.416]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:50.139 --> 01:57:50.719]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.434 --> 01:57:52.534]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.195 --> 01:57:54.355]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.935 --> 01:57:55.796]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.516 --> 01:57:58.457]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.477 --> 01:58:01.758]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.278 --> 01:58:06.420]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.622 --> 01:58:14.563]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, now into our number three.
[01:58:14.583 --> 01:58:19.125]  I'm so glad that you were able to join us today.
[01:58:22.739 --> 01:58:26.721]  In this hour, I want to get into this article by the Associated Press.
[01:58:26.781 --> 01:58:28.082]  We added our own headline, of course.
[01:58:28.442 --> 01:58:30.763]  Charles Manson clears Ted Bundy of murder.
[01:58:31.664 --> 01:58:34.866]  Their headline, Probe Leaders Didn't Order Prison Abuse.
[01:58:35.546 --> 01:58:38.367]  And that was conducted by Donald Rumsfeld and his minions.
[01:58:39.128 --> 01:58:42.410]  It was like Janet Reno investigating herself on Waco.
[01:58:42.930 --> 01:58:44.571]  Oh, I find myself not guilty.
[01:58:46.072 --> 01:58:48.953]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[01:58:50.294 --> 01:58:51.875]  I guess first up here...
[01:58:53.049 --> 01:58:54.711]  It would be Jason in New York.
[01:58:54.791 --> 01:58:55.531]  Welcome, Jason.
[01:58:56.312 --> 01:58:57.133]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[01:58:57.313 --> 01:58:57.793]  Hello.
[01:58:57.813 --> 01:58:58.534]  Hello there.
[01:58:58.554 --> 01:59:04.399]  Listen, I just wanted to say I have both of your videos, 9-11 Road to Tyranny and American Dictators, and they're fabulous.
[01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:06.341]  And they've really woken me up.
[01:59:06.601 --> 01:59:16.851]  And I noticed you were talking earlier about David Icke and Arnold Schwarzenegger going to visit the Rothschild, Lord Rothschild with Warren Buffett.
[01:59:17.185 --> 01:59:18.426]  I wasn't talking about David Icke.
[01:59:18.666 --> 01:59:21.989]  Well, maybe one of your other callers called in and had a question about him.
[01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.810]  Oh, sure, yeah.
[01:59:22.970 --> 01:59:29.515]  But in any event, isn't it true that the Rothschild family used to be called the Bowers, that they actually changed their name?
[01:59:30.636 --> 01:59:33.198]  I think David Icke says this in his book, The Biggest Secret.
[01:59:33.258 --> 01:59:37.541]  Well, no, I mean, I've had a Rothschild on the show.
[01:59:37.561 --> 01:59:39.123]  I mean, there's a lot of Rothschilds.
[01:59:39.163 --> 01:59:43.486]  He's the editor of the, oh, what is it, the Progressive Magazine.
[01:59:43.546 --> 01:59:45.648]  And, I mean, yeah, it was just the name was hard to pronounce it.
[01:59:46.588 --> 01:59:50.175]  They had a pawn shop in Germany and had a red shield as its symbol.
[01:59:50.455 --> 01:59:50.696]  Right.
[01:59:50.936 --> 01:59:52.279]  And so it means red shield.
[01:59:52.579 --> 01:59:52.780]  Right.
[01:59:53.982 --> 01:59:55.625]  Roth and child, yeah, in German.
[01:59:56.041 --> 02:00:01.725]  But the control that they're manifesting over the economy with the Federal Reserve is just incredible.
[02:00:01.765 --> 02:00:04.727]  I mean, the Federal Reserve is... Well, the Rothschilds really do run a lot of stuff.
[02:00:04.787 --> 02:00:14.074]  It's like whenever they arrested that oil tycoon that had control of one of the major oil companies in Russia, it was like, oh, you didn't get the company, Putin, because Lord Rothschild secretly owned it.
[02:00:14.495 --> 02:00:14.755]  Right.
[02:00:14.795 --> 02:00:19.478]  And then they just grabbed a bunch of other stuff, and it's like every time you turn around, he's the real owner of it.
[02:00:19.979 --> 02:00:22.781]  It's the Yukos Oil Company in Russia.
[02:00:22.881 --> 02:00:24.142]  It's just incredible, and...
[02:00:24.744 --> 02:00:29.769]  I just wanted to say thanks so much, and let's fight this new world order and try to really beat it to death.
[02:00:30.389 --> 02:00:32.732]  And then you find out that Rothschild's actually funded Hitler.
[02:00:33.231 --> 02:00:38.677]  Yeah, that's something that, you know, for Jewish people, it's very difficult for them to study that.
[02:00:38.737 --> 02:00:42.441]  But there are some people, for example, like Barry Chamish, who have exposed that.
[02:00:42.461 --> 02:00:43.302]  Have you ever heard of him?
[02:00:43.362 --> 02:00:44.243]  Oh, yeah, we've had him on.
[02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.385]  He writes for the Jerusalem Post.
[02:00:46.685 --> 02:00:53.352]  There are masses of Jews now writing historical documents and books and mainstream news articles.
[02:00:53.853 --> 02:00:54.754]  The Zionists...
[02:00:55.554 --> 02:01:00.056]  Some of the top people in Hitler's government were Jewish, and they're not Jews.
[02:01:00.116 --> 02:01:07.179]  It's a criminal crime cabal that set Hitler up.
[02:01:07.219 --> 02:01:13.321]  Look, all these names, what people claim they are, it's always deeper than what you see on the surface.
[02:01:13.821 --> 02:01:14.382]  Absolutely.
[02:01:14.982 --> 02:01:15.843]  It's a death cult.
[02:01:15.903 --> 02:01:19.367]  That's what Marshall Law, my new film, The Last Hour, covers.
[02:01:19.987 --> 02:01:28.015]  We actually show, after we show you the police state in 9-11, we go, okay, here's an hour on Skull and Bones and the Nazis and Bohemian Grove and all of this.
[02:01:28.256 --> 02:01:29.757]  They're devil worshippers.
[02:01:29.777 --> 02:01:30.818]  They're not Jews.
[02:01:31.078 --> 02:01:32.019]  They're not Germans.
[02:01:32.039 --> 02:01:33.080]  They're not Chinamen.
[02:01:33.521 --> 02:01:35.383]  They are devil worshippers.
[02:01:35.703 --> 02:01:36.384]  You said it, Alex.
[02:01:36.564 --> 02:01:37.024]  You said it.
[02:01:38.065 --> 02:01:43.586]  I've heard that in the Skull and Bones tomb that they actually eat off of plateware that is embossed with swastikas.
[02:01:43.606 --> 02:01:45.107]  Yeah, that's MSNBC, yeah.
[02:01:46.327 --> 02:01:49.828]  And before, they have old swastikas.
[02:01:49.848 --> 02:01:52.568]  I have Bohemian Republications with swastikas.
[02:01:53.088 --> 02:01:55.629]  Swastikas were all over America in the 20s and 30s.
[02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:57.849]  It was a symbol of good luck.
[02:01:58.549 --> 02:01:59.530]  It's just incredible.
[02:01:59.610 --> 02:02:06.271]  I can remember walking down the street during the presidential election and trying to tell this woman who was campaigning for Kerry, I said,
[02:02:07.169 --> 02:02:11.172]  Isn't he a member of Skull and Bones, and isn't that a very questionable organization?
[02:02:11.612 --> 02:02:16.976]  And she said, oh, I've been working for Kerry for over 20 years, and he would never be a member of that organization.
[02:02:17.356 --> 02:02:20.438]  So, yeah, he's not even a member when he admits he is.
[02:02:20.578 --> 02:02:21.299]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[02:02:21.319 --> 02:02:21.699]  Thank you.
[02:02:21.719 --> 02:02:23.160]  It's a secret I can't talk about.
[02:02:23.180 --> 02:02:24.621]  Not much, it's a secret.
[02:02:24.641 --> 02:02:27.623]  I wish it was something I could manifest for you, but I can't.
[02:02:28.203 --> 02:02:28.924]  Let's meet the press.
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.242]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:31.562 --> 02:02:34.125]  Oh, should his little devil laugh when Tim Russert asks him about it?
[02:02:36.887 --> 02:02:37.528]  Talk about it!
[02:02:38.028 --> 02:02:39.009]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:39.049 --> 02:02:39.610]  Stay with us.

[02:03:10.364 --> 02:03:21.017]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.157 --> 02:03:23.059]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[02:06:41.639 --> 02:06:42.020]  All right.
[02:06:42.560 --> 02:06:46.724]  I promised I'd go straight to your calls, and so let me do that.
[02:06:46.764 --> 02:06:48.806]  But let's just go really quickly through these.
[02:06:48.846 --> 02:06:52.189]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231, and then I'm going to plunge into more of the news.
[02:06:55.178 --> 02:06:57.100]  Let's talk to Sheldon in Arizona.
[02:06:57.140 --> 02:06:57.760]  You're on the air.
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:58.100]  Welcome.
[02:06:59.081 --> 02:06:59.841]  Hi, Alex.
[02:07:00.162 --> 02:07:09.408]  Just wanted to let your listening audience know that Genesis has a brand new feed on the 4D TV digital satellite system receiver.
[02:07:09.428 --> 02:07:11.830]  It came on last night after midnight.
[02:07:12.871 --> 02:07:16.833]  So if they have a 4D TV receiver, it's the G9 channel 952.
[02:07:20.734 --> 02:07:21.054]  Really?
[02:07:21.135 --> 02:07:21.935]  Another feed?
[02:07:22.336 --> 02:07:24.158]  Yeah, on Republic Broadcasting Network.
[02:07:24.178 --> 02:07:28.543]  They just got a brand new channel on 4D TV also.
[02:07:28.903 --> 02:07:29.464]  Oh, interesting.
[02:07:29.484 --> 02:07:32.587]  Are you familiar with the 4D TV system?
[02:07:32.647 --> 02:07:33.788]  No, we've got a bunch of satellites.
[02:07:33.828 --> 02:07:34.709]  What else is on your mind?
[02:07:37.212 --> 02:07:40.736]  I can't remember the other thing I wanted to bring up, but that'll be awesome.
[02:07:41.744 --> 02:07:54.430]  What do you think about the article I was reading in the last hour where the guy is chained down to a hospital bed, and the cop admits he jumps on his chest to make him give a urine sample, and when he won't do it, they taser him twice, torturing him.
[02:07:54.871 --> 02:07:57.592]  Oh, it sounds like something right out of a science fiction movie.
[02:07:58.092 --> 02:07:59.013]  It's unbelievable.
[02:07:59.233 --> 02:08:06.276]  Yeah, imagine if you made a science fiction movie ten years ago where, in the future, if you don't give samples on demand, you are electrocuted with 50,000 volts.
[02:08:06.317 --> 02:08:09.138]  People would laugh at that movie.
[02:08:09.642 --> 02:08:10.423]  It's the new freedom.
[02:08:10.463 --> 02:08:11.484]  Let's all get used to it.
[02:08:11.924 --> 02:08:12.645]  I hear you, man.
[02:08:12.685 --> 02:08:13.105]  I love it.
[02:08:13.525 --> 02:08:14.606]  Bob in Ohio.
[02:08:14.666 --> 02:08:15.667]  Bob, good to hear from you.
[02:08:15.687 --> 02:08:16.408]  What's on your mind?
[02:08:19.170 --> 02:08:20.531]  You got a lot on your mind, Bob.
[02:08:20.751 --> 02:08:21.832]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:08:22.012 --> 02:08:22.412]  Good, sir.
[02:08:23.073 --> 02:08:27.236]  Well, I just got to tell you, boy, they're pumping this stuff out on TV regular.
[02:08:28.017 --> 02:08:31.500]  I was watching... Oh, gosh.
[02:08:31.540 --> 02:08:31.880]  Yeah.
[02:08:31.900 --> 02:08:34.442]  Yeah.
[02:08:36.215 --> 02:08:37.816]  What happens is they're pumping one out.
[02:08:37.916 --> 02:08:38.876]  That'll be a good way to start.
[02:08:39.256 --> 02:08:39.496]  Right.
[02:08:39.616 --> 02:08:42.897]  Okay, anyways, what they're pumping out is like Ripley's Believe It or Not.
[02:08:44.138 --> 02:08:50.320]  Last night they had Dean Cain on there and they had the Chipsons on, the Jacobson family or whatever.
[02:08:50.360 --> 02:08:51.160]  Oh yeah, I've got that.
[02:08:51.200 --> 02:08:53.601]  How wonderful it is and the future we'll all have it.
[02:08:53.641 --> 02:08:55.122]  How cool the family is.
[02:08:55.462 --> 02:08:56.262]  Yeah, oh yeah.
[02:08:56.642 --> 02:08:58.423]  And then the night before that...
[02:08:59.279 --> 02:09:04.903]  On Modern Marvels, they had on, you know, the DARPA thing up there.
[02:09:04.923 --> 02:09:05.964]  They didn't call it that.
[02:09:06.004 --> 02:09:11.087]  It was just the airship, you know, and how it could read the newspaper over your shoulder.
[02:09:11.568 --> 02:09:13.029]  But they didn't say nothing about that.
[02:09:13.049 --> 02:09:16.331]  And how our cities are all going to have these loving boys watching us.
[02:09:16.491 --> 02:09:19.393]  Right, and how the average Londoner...
[02:09:20.303 --> 02:09:22.425]  It's on camera 300 times a day.
[02:09:22.445 --> 02:09:24.687]  They have 4 million cameras in London, yeah.
[02:09:24.707 --> 02:09:42.281]  Right, and then they had this thing where they said that you'll be able to buy these cameras on a sheet of paper, peel them off, and as soon as you peel them off and stick them somewhere, they're real tiny, like about half the size of a postage stamp, and it'll immediately be on the Internet.
[02:09:43.223 --> 02:09:45.064]  You know, like, this is all really cool.
[02:09:45.144 --> 02:09:47.324]  We'll be surveilled everywhere you go.
[02:09:47.484 --> 02:09:58.728]  Hey, Toyota, Saab, GM, they're all announcing that all cars, by law, they're trying to push us by 08, will have an infrared camera connected to a cell phone uplink.
[02:09:59.028 --> 02:10:07.071]  And if you're rude to your wife, if you're looking away too much, it warns you, and then it calls the police, and it goes to the Emergency Management Center.
[02:10:07.091 --> 02:10:12.553]  And I have, in the film Matrix of Evil, I have the mainstream news articles out of Green Bay.
[02:10:13.624 --> 02:10:21.746]  And the governor says, oh yeah, all the cell phones now track you by law, but we're getting the federal funding where real time we'll all track you on a board.
[02:10:21.806 --> 02:10:25.947]  Of course, now they have websites where if you get somebody's cell number, you can go to the website and see where they are.
[02:10:26.347 --> 02:10:27.027]  Everybody can.
[02:10:27.327 --> 02:10:28.388]  It's just all part of freedom.
[02:10:28.728 --> 02:10:34.729]  But under this one, we'll all be able to dial in and listen to you and make sure you're good, and even when the phone's off.
[02:10:35.029 --> 02:10:35.849]  Isn't that nice?
[02:10:36.530 --> 02:10:40.331]  Oh yeah, and about a week ago... Whatever happened to the Fourth Amendment?
[02:10:41.071 --> 02:10:41.651]  Good question.
[02:10:42.276 --> 02:10:49.138]  And then about a week ago on the Outer Limits, they had this school where the yuppie sends her son because she don't want to be bothered with him.
[02:10:49.959 --> 02:11:02.983]  And as soon as they get him in there, they put an implant in him, and it completely controls him, and they sell these students to, or these graduates to companies to run them because they'll do anything they're told, including assassination or whatever.
[02:11:03.003 --> 02:11:05.824]  And then today on the AM radio...
[02:11:07.427 --> 02:11:20.399]  In my area here, they had on that they got a little box for you that you'll be able to plug in a chip for your head that if you're feeling depressed, you just turn it on and turn it off until you feel better.
[02:11:20.420 --> 02:11:27.226]  And over 3,000 Americans a year are ordered onto psychiatric drugs when they've now authorized...
[02:11:28.342 --> 02:11:33.525]  Well, all I can say about, you know, the police abusing you is, you know... Uh, yeah, it was, uh, you ever hear of Alex Harvey?
[02:11:33.665 --> 02:11:33.725]  No.
[02:11:55.265 --> 02:12:04.459]  Okay, well, anyway, he's on around here, and it's a clear channel station, of course, and he was saying, oh, and by the way, you know, you'll be able to get...
[02:12:04.938 --> 02:12:13.303]  An implant, and it'll have a little box, and when you're feeling bad, you'll just turn it up, turn the button clockwise until you feel better.
[02:12:13.323 --> 02:12:15.865]  Yeah, that got FDA approval on two different devices.
[02:12:17.406 --> 02:12:18.486]  I have mainstream articles.
[02:12:18.526 --> 02:12:18.886]  We've read them.
[02:12:18.906 --> 02:12:20.908]  They're already about to make you take it!
[02:12:21.828 --> 02:12:22.949]  Oh, yeah!
[02:12:23.089 --> 02:12:24.950]  Well, I figure, you know.
[02:12:24.970 --> 02:12:25.771]  Oh, it's good.
[02:12:25.791 --> 02:12:31.154]  I figure, hey, when that happens, that's when you'll just have to do whatever you have to do.
[02:12:32.211 --> 02:12:34.573]  Well, a lot of so-called Christians aren't worried.
[02:12:34.593 --> 02:12:36.475]  They're just hiding out, waiting to be raptured.
[02:12:36.955 --> 02:12:39.217]  And regardless, don't we have the job to warn people?
[02:12:39.297 --> 02:12:40.438]  I mean, don't we have to fight this?
[02:12:40.718 --> 02:12:41.459]  Well, I don't know.
[02:12:41.519 --> 02:12:46.883]  Most of the Christians I run into, I just tell them, you know, if you read the book, there is a fork in the road.
[02:12:47.724 --> 02:12:49.105]  It doesn't have to happen.
[02:12:49.145 --> 02:12:51.627]  It doesn't say that it's going to happen.
[02:12:51.667 --> 02:12:54.009]  It just says it'll happen if you act this way.
[02:12:55.197 --> 02:13:00.899]  Well, I mean, it says it's going to happen, but, you know, whole civilizations were given 100-year reprieves.
[02:13:02.080 --> 02:13:05.381]  And regardless, we have a job to warn people about this evil.
[02:13:05.701 --> 02:13:07.321]  It's on our hands if we don't do it.
[02:13:07.341 --> 02:13:08.002]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:08.462 --> 02:13:20.086]  No, I mean, look, listeners send me, you know, on Fox or CBS or NBC or ABC, they have little synopses of, you know, what's on tonight, what's on Rent Matrix or 24 this week.
[02:13:21.486 --> 02:13:22.787]  And every week I get...
[02:13:23.740 --> 02:13:26.501]  Probably ten articles from Britain or the U.S.
[02:13:26.581 --> 02:13:27.061]  or L.A.
[02:13:27.121 --> 02:13:31.363]  Law or Boston Legal or all these shows.
[02:13:32.003 --> 02:13:37.406]  And this week they torture a young girl to make the father answer questions.
[02:13:37.686 --> 02:13:39.907]  When he won't answer questions, they go ahead and kill her.
[02:13:40.447 --> 02:13:41.527]  Or they threaten to kill her.
[02:13:42.568 --> 02:13:43.848]  And it's good.
[02:13:43.928 --> 02:13:45.689]  Killing people's children is good.
[02:13:45.769 --> 02:13:46.930]  Tune in and find out.
[02:13:47.710 --> 02:13:52.192]  And then in the real world, they take them to Abu Ghraib and they torture the young girl in front of daddy.
[02:13:52.751 --> 02:13:54.532]  They'll make them answer questions, and it's good.
[02:13:55.973 --> 02:14:01.037]  And now, you know, the cops all watch this, and then they think it's normal, as the TV said it was.
[02:14:01.998 --> 02:14:06.141]  And so, the guy won't give a urine sample, so we're going to zap you twice, you know, because you're chained down.
[02:14:06.161 --> 02:14:08.943]  It's not torture, it's freedom.
[02:14:10.164 --> 02:14:12.286]  Let's talk to Jason in Maryland.
[02:14:12.346 --> 02:14:13.186]  Jason, go ahead.
[02:14:13.206 --> 02:14:14.647]  Hi, Alex.
[02:14:14.707 --> 02:14:15.988]  Thanks for your work.
[02:14:16.069 --> 02:14:17.510]  Great show today, as usual.
[02:14:17.530 --> 02:14:21.833]  I'm calling about Syria, see what your take is on
[02:14:22.244 --> 02:14:24.565]  Well, Damascus has been a ruinous heap quite a few times.
[02:14:47.219 --> 02:14:51.863]  So, I mean, that area is always in war, and that's not my forte.
[02:14:51.903 --> 02:14:54.004]  I'm not an expert on that.
[02:14:54.645 --> 02:14:57.266]  I just know that Syria and Iran are not a threat to anybody.
[02:14:57.787 --> 02:15:01.069]  They're pushovers, and that's why they're going to be attacked and invaded.
[02:15:01.489 --> 02:15:03.551]  Meanwhile, Pakistan says they'll kill U.S.
[02:15:03.591 --> 02:15:04.632]  troops if they cross the border.
[02:15:04.672 --> 02:15:07.574]  We go, yes, sir, and you are good.
[02:15:07.974 --> 02:15:09.135]  Let us give you more nukes.
[02:15:09.315 --> 02:15:11.697]  Same thing with North Korea, China, you name it.
[02:15:14.434 --> 02:15:21.278]  Do you think... I was listening to a fellow named Andre Eglashon the other day on George Norrie.
[02:15:21.298 --> 02:15:23.159]  Yeah, I didn't hear it, but I heard about it.
[02:15:23.179 --> 02:15:23.979]  I've heard him before.
[02:15:24.019 --> 02:15:27.841]  He does a great job exposing the private nature of the Federal Reserve.
[02:15:28.362 --> 02:15:28.622]  Right.
[02:15:29.342 --> 02:15:39.168]  And he was saying how Saddam was taken out because he was about to change his currency for the... To the dinar.
[02:15:40.088 --> 02:15:40.829]  Well, to the euro.
[02:15:41.857 --> 02:15:44.963]  He was going to go to an Arab gold currency.
[02:15:45.704 --> 02:15:46.907]  Do you feel that that's the case?
[02:15:46.927 --> 02:15:48.951]  That's a part of it.
[02:15:49.552 --> 02:15:51.436]  That he was going to drop the dollar and it would have...
[02:15:52.389 --> 02:15:53.150]  That's a part of it.
[02:15:54.611 --> 02:16:02.838]  What do you think about China fixing to do the same thing, that they're openly stating that they're going to drop the dollar and go to the euro?
[02:16:02.878 --> 02:16:06.861]  Well, Bush has said a dropping dollar is good, that they actually are carrying out the globalist plan.
[02:16:06.881 --> 02:16:07.281]  The U.S.
[02:16:07.341 --> 02:16:10.144]  is controlled by Europe, and they play the part of the good guys.
[02:16:10.184 --> 02:16:20.672]  We're playing the part of the bad guys right now, and they have this whole false argument in WWF theater to make the people think that there's some type of bipolar world when it's really...
[02:16:22.335 --> 02:16:24.977]  What year was that?
[02:16:48.965 --> 02:16:53.647]  That particular PNAC document was Rebuilding America's Defenses, released September 20, 2000.
[02:16:54.207 --> 02:16:54.487]  Wow.
[02:16:54.628 --> 02:16:57.969]  One last question.
[02:16:58.849 --> 02:17:06.653]  As you see the spider web develop with the Bilderbergs, who is at the top?
[02:17:07.393 --> 02:17:16.477]  Well, if you look at the heads of the Bilderberg Group, the heads of the CFR, the heads of the Trilateral Commission, these are different bodies that manage different sectors of the world.
[02:17:16.497 --> 02:17:18.458]  The Trilateral Commission is economic, mainly.
[02:17:19.393 --> 02:17:21.875]  So the people running the Federal Reserve are just part of that?
[02:17:21.895 --> 02:17:22.416]  Yes, sir, they are.
[02:17:22.456 --> 02:17:23.356]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.534 --> 02:17:47.095]  We're good to go.
[02:18:14.923 --> 02:18:19.306]  And remember, if you read the Midas Report, you'll receive a free Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar.
[02:18:47.043 --> 02:18:49.566]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:50.247 --> 02:18:59.817]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:19:00.879 --> 02:19:10.425]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:19:11.445 --> 02:19:16.949]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[02:19:46.477 --> 02:19:47.258]  Terrorism.
[02:19:47.398 --> 02:19:48.138]  Terrorism.
[02:19:48.238 --> 02:19:49.079]  Chemical attacks.
[02:19:49.159 --> 02:19:49.839]  Dirty bombs.
[02:19:49.919 --> 02:19:50.339]  Fallout.
[02:19:50.419 --> 02:19:51.420]  Biological attack.
[02:19:51.600 --> 02:19:52.120]  And threats.
[02:19:52.200 --> 02:19:54.302]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:19:54.562 --> 02:19:56.163]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:19:56.403 --> 02:19:58.884]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:19:59.264 --> 02:20:13.853]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:20:13.873 --> 02:20:14.213]  government.
[02:20:14.373 --> 02:20:16.174]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:20:16.554 --> 02:20:22.456]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:20:22.596 --> 02:20:27.098]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[02:20:46.770 --> 02:20:52.291]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:20:52.451 --> 02:20:53.512]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:20:53.632 --> 02:20:54.492]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:20:54.612 --> 02:20:57.453]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:20:57.633 --> 02:21:02.514]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:21:02.754 --> 02:21:03.854]  Check out this new product.
[02:21:04.014 --> 02:21:06.895]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:21:07.275 --> 02:21:10.996]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:21:11.136 --> 02:21:11.316]  Look.
[02:21:11.496 --> 02:21:13.819]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.
[02:21:13.879 --> 02:21:18.725]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:21:19.005 --> 02:21:22.129]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[02:21:22.249 --> 02:21:27.655]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:21:27.755 --> 02:21:28.516]  Try Nobio.
[02:21:28.636 --> 02:21:29.598]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:21:30.779 --> 02:21:33.662]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:21:33.842 --> 02:21:36.725]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[02:21:36.905 --> 02:21:39.368]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.

[02:22:08.901 --> 02:22:09.822]  Welcome back, folks.
[02:22:09.842 --> 02:22:20.544]  I'm going to go back to your calls, Alan and JR and David and Ron and Warren and everybody else, but I need to talk about a few other key issues and cover some news first.
[02:22:23.444 --> 02:22:25.525]  La Cosa Nostra, or the family.
[02:22:27.645 --> 02:22:31.046]  When you think about the mafia in America or in Europe,
[02:22:32.799 --> 02:22:36.962]  Italians are synonymous with the idea, which is ridiculous.
[02:22:38.723 --> 02:23:02.339]  Actually, the Italian Mafia, the only reason you heard about it so much was because it started becoming powerful and threatened to begin to rival the WASP Mafia, and then beneath the Anglo-Saxon white Protestant male Mafia, you then had the Irish and Jewish Mafias,
[02:23:03.726 --> 02:23:10.850]  And then on down the line you have the Italians, and today it's the Russians and the Chinese triads and the Japanese mafia.
[02:23:11.870 --> 02:23:14.271]  Now you've got the Mexican mafia, the Latin mafias.
[02:23:15.352 --> 02:23:20.414]  They're all controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency, which is the arm of the WASP mafia.
[02:23:21.315 --> 02:23:32.140]  The WASP mafia has the nuclear weapons and the X-ray lasers from space and the biological weapons warheads and tens of thousands of special forces hit teams.
[02:23:32.180 --> 02:23:33.501]  I mean, that's your real mafia.
[02:23:34.096 --> 02:23:37.278]  Now, you know, not some guy's, you know, good fellas.
[02:23:37.978 --> 02:23:38.699]  That's a joke.
[02:23:39.679 --> 02:23:40.700]  It's a complete joke.
[02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:46.343]  And a lot of times the CIA would use different mafias as a buffer to carry out hits and stuff for them.
[02:23:48.224 --> 02:23:49.685]  But you look at how mafias are set up.
[02:23:49.725 --> 02:24:00.852]  I mean, when a made man, a member of the Cosa Nostra, would go into the ritual, they would cut their finger and bleed on a...
[02:24:01.747 --> 02:24:10.611]  Piece of tissue paper, and then they'd have a little picture of Mary, and they would swear an oath to the devil above Mary.
[02:24:10.991 --> 02:24:11.672]  This is admitted.
[02:24:11.732 --> 02:24:12.672]  This has even been recorded.
[02:24:13.112 --> 02:24:14.913]  And burn the picture of Mary.
[02:24:15.673 --> 02:24:16.574]  Why do they do this?
[02:24:16.654 --> 02:24:17.294]  It's a test.
[02:24:17.334 --> 02:24:29.880]  I mean, this person's already killed a bunch of people for you, made their bones, done innumerable criminal acts, killed friends under orders generally, now look at them in the eyes, to test them.
[02:24:30.447 --> 02:24:32.989]  But the final thing is, you've got a good little Catholic boy.
[02:24:33.529 --> 02:24:35.811]  How do you make sure he's going to go all the way for you?
[02:24:37.312 --> 02:24:38.573]  Well, of course, the devil's involved.
[02:24:40.835 --> 02:24:42.116]  Well, you look at Skull and Bones.
[02:24:42.156 --> 02:24:43.017]  It's the same thing.
[02:24:43.117 --> 02:24:46.259]  Cutting themselves, getting in coffins, weird sexual stuff.
[02:24:46.279 --> 02:24:47.200]  They go even further.
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:48.180]  And what is that?
[02:24:48.220 --> 02:24:49.301]  A Germanic death cult?
[02:24:49.381 --> 02:24:49.902]  A mafia.
[02:24:50.422 --> 02:24:53.204]  Where most are CIA directors and four-year presidents.
[02:24:54.285 --> 02:24:55.626]  Come from, this is the real mob.
[02:24:57.107 --> 02:24:58.028]  And it goes back.
[02:24:59.600 --> 02:25:11.906]  And you see the Illuminati and the Prince, you know, the Machiavellian politics, the Illuminati, Giuseppe and others, you know, definitely high level on the Illuminati.
[02:25:13.427 --> 02:25:15.148]  And all these groups do the same things.
[02:25:17.489 --> 02:25:18.970]  And then you see the Mexican Mafia.
[02:25:19.430 --> 02:25:26.734]  You know, you gotta go kill an innocent old lady and steal her car before you, you know, become a real inner member of the gang.
[02:25:27.154 --> 02:25:28.575]  They copy the same stuff.
[02:25:29.680 --> 02:25:38.025]  The triads with the Chinese, the Japanese have to do all these different criminal acts and then cut one of their fingers off, their pinky, the first digit.
[02:25:40.687 --> 02:25:43.008]  All these different blood rituals, blood tests.
[02:25:43.048 --> 02:25:50.853]  I mean, you can just go get a criminology book, university textbook, go to school, be in the FBI, go to school to be a detective, whatever.
[02:25:50.873 --> 02:25:51.753]  You're going to learn all this.
[02:25:51.933 --> 02:25:53.014]  I mean, this is just known.
[02:25:55.140 --> 02:26:01.683]  And J. Edgar Hoover had the nerve, I haven't even got the old film of him doing this before Congress, there is no La Cosa Nostra, there is no mafia.
[02:26:02.803 --> 02:26:10.326]  And that's because they had photos of him, this is admitted, never been challenged, you know, in a dress, performing something on his lieutenant.
[02:26:12.987 --> 02:26:14.168]  So this is how they operate.
[02:26:15.288 --> 02:26:19.550]  And they have the nerve up until the late 50s to say there is no such thing as organized crime.
[02:26:22.306 --> 02:26:27.649]  Because in the decades before that, the WASP and Jewish mob, and again, the Jewish mob is smaller compared to the WASP mob.
[02:26:27.669 --> 02:26:28.550]  They kind of work together.
[02:26:29.331 --> 02:26:32.453]  They were going after the Italians, because the Italians were getting pretty powerful.
[02:26:34.434 --> 02:26:38.517]  And the Italians said, okay, well, we got your boss doing this, and then suddenly, okay, it doesn't exist.
[02:26:38.898 --> 02:26:39.838]  Call off the dogs.
[02:26:39.878 --> 02:26:40.499]  Leave them alone.
[02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:45.963]  I mean, just think about the nerve of J. Edgar Hoover to say there is no mafia.
[02:26:45.983 --> 02:26:49.685]  I mean, you know, that's like Rumsfeld saying, I never said there were weapons of mass destruction.
[02:26:50.086 --> 02:26:50.526]  Oh, you didn't.
[02:26:51.770 --> 02:26:53.191]  Why do we put up with any of this?
[02:26:54.211 --> 02:27:06.757]  And so with Bush, you've got the old Germanic Nazi mob up there with the Jewish mafia, and none of them could care less about anybody except their own families.
[02:27:09.338 --> 02:27:16.461]  And their whole system tells you not to have a family, but then they've all got their families, because they know if you don't have a family, you can't protect yourself.
[02:27:17.202 --> 02:27:17.702]  We're on the march.
[02:27:17.722 --> 02:27:18.283]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:18.303 --> 02:27:19.844]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.471 --> 02:27:54.114]  If you're $10,000 in credit card debt or more and are making minimum monthly payments but getting nowhere, Debt Relief USA has the answer.
[02:27:54.254 --> 02:27:57.736]  Call 1-800-516-6567 now.

[02:28:46.065 --> 02:28:48.046]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[02:28:48.126 --> 02:28:48.786]  Hello, folks.
[02:28:48.926 --> 02:28:58.849]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:59.210 --> 02:29:03.731]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:03.811 --> 02:29:15.135]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.735 --> 02:29:22.582]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.982 --> 02:29:25.124]  Your purified water is now ready.
[02:29:25.604 --> 02:29:30.589]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:30:46.610 --> 02:30:50.553]  The police are the biggest gang out there.
[02:30:50.613 --> 02:30:52.374]  And they serve the New World Order.
[02:31:16.781 --> 02:31:18.662]  And the good cops are being run off the force.
[02:31:18.983 --> 02:31:27.209]  And they're now telling us, we're going to torture you and abuse you and take what you've got and get rid of your due process and you're going to accept it and you're going to like it.
[02:31:27.569 --> 02:31:30.371]  No, I'm not going to accept it and I'm not going to like it.
[02:31:32.913 --> 02:31:36.696]  They're trying to tell us all this evil's good, trying to give us their serial killer mindset.
[02:31:37.336 --> 02:31:39.358]  They can't get away with it if we say no.
[02:31:41.039 --> 02:31:42.280]  You think things are bad right now?
[02:31:42.300 --> 02:31:43.321]  They're going to get a lot worse.
[02:31:44.121 --> 02:31:46.203]  Because these criminals just are going hog wild.
[02:31:47.248 --> 02:31:50.430]  Hog wild, looting this country at every level.
[02:31:51.511 --> 02:31:52.331]  Systematically.
[02:31:54.513 --> 02:31:56.474]  Alright, let's take a few calls and go back into the news.
[02:31:56.974 --> 02:31:57.835]  I'm going to move quick here.
[02:31:58.235 --> 02:32:00.016]  Allen in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:32:00.557 --> 02:32:02.638]  Alex, the communities are forming.
[02:32:02.678 --> 02:32:06.020]  We were kind of like an anthill that got... Your phone is really muffled.
[02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:07.361]  Can you try to talk into the receiver?
[02:32:07.421 --> 02:32:08.042]  There, is that better?
[02:32:08.062 --> 02:32:09.803]  Can you hear me now?
[02:32:10.283 --> 02:32:10.904]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:32:10.924 --> 02:32:11.204]  Okay, sorry.
[02:32:12.185 --> 02:32:19.389]  We were kind of like an anthill that got stepped on during 9-11, and now people are reforming into communities, new clusters.
[02:32:19.409 --> 02:32:20.970]  There are all kinds of meetings.
[02:32:20.990 --> 02:32:26.153]  Churches are showing videos and PowerPoint presentations, and groups are organizing.
[02:32:26.173 --> 02:32:27.894]  So that is happening.
[02:32:29.094 --> 02:32:31.256]  I wanted to touch on the... Let me ask you a question.
[02:32:31.496 --> 02:32:34.037]  Are you on a cell phone with a wireless plug-in?
[02:32:34.277 --> 02:32:39.240]  I'm on a weird-looking little two-inch thing that I drag around my shop, Alex.
[02:32:40.725 --> 02:32:41.105]  That's all right.
[02:32:41.125 --> 02:32:42.085]  I'm just trying to understand you.
[02:32:42.125 --> 02:32:42.845]  Go ahead.
[02:32:42.865 --> 02:32:43.686]  That's what's happening.
[02:32:43.766 --> 02:32:48.466]  It's kind of a little high-tech device, but I guess it doesn't work as good as it's supposed to.
[02:32:49.667 --> 02:32:55.988]  But I wanted to touch on the sobriety checkpoint, the legislation that's up here in Texas.
[02:32:56.008 --> 02:32:58.968]  I'll have you finish up quick, because it's almost inaudible.
[02:32:59.428 --> 02:32:59.728]  Okay.
[02:32:59.988 --> 02:33:00.328]  Okay.
[02:33:00.448 --> 02:33:06.429]  Texans go to www.texansagainstcheckpoints.
[02:33:07.850 --> 02:33:09.630]  That's texansagainst
[02:33:10.447 --> 02:33:10.907]  Checkpoints.
[02:33:11.047 --> 02:33:14.748]  And I've heard these people on the air, and they're doing a good job, but let me be clear about this, Alan.
[02:33:15.968 --> 02:33:25.490]  We're saying we're fighting checkpoints because they want to codify it into state law, but it's just they can't have checkpoints for drunk driving right now under federal rulings.
[02:33:26.270 --> 02:33:30.971]  They're already doing it, quote, under the National Seatbelt Initiative, where they search for whatever they want.
[02:33:31.191 --> 02:33:32.592]  So they're already checkpoints.
[02:33:32.892 --> 02:33:36.753]  Yeah, well, they've got these in 40 states already.
[02:33:36.793 --> 02:33:38.913]  They're trying to take Texas next, and they will...
[02:33:46.582 --> 02:33:48.003]  Listen, I hear you and I appreciate the call.
[02:33:48.063 --> 02:33:50.524]  Call back on another line tomorrow and I'll be able to have you on, Alan.
[02:33:50.564 --> 02:33:52.404]  It's just I can't really understand much of what you're saying.
[02:33:52.884 --> 02:33:53.785]  Maybe the listeners can.
[02:33:53.825 --> 02:33:55.405]  By the time I hear you, it's really hard.
[02:33:55.425 --> 02:33:56.065]  I've got a strain.
[02:33:57.106 --> 02:34:00.147]  I had, what, the attorney Pat Barber on about five years ago.
[02:34:00.167 --> 02:34:01.347]  I had him on again about a year ago.
[02:34:01.827 --> 02:34:05.429]  He was a former prosecutor there in West Texas.
[02:34:05.469 --> 02:34:06.509]  Very prominent lawyer.
[02:34:07.808 --> 02:34:15.235]  Driving along on a Sunday afternoon and saw a family, churchgoers, with their goods thrown out all over the highway with the state police in it.
[02:34:16.756 --> 02:34:24.864]  He got mad about it, put a billboard on his own ranch property there on the highway saying, with a toll-free number you called and explained that it was a violation of the Fourth Amendment.
[02:34:27.767 --> 02:34:31.110]  They criminally started going after him saying he couldn't have that sign up.
[02:34:31.270 --> 02:34:33.632]  I mean, this is how insane things have gotten.
[02:34:36.269 --> 02:34:40.352]  So, I mean, it's been going on for a long time, and I wish they'd put the checkpoints on the border.
[02:34:42.134 --> 02:34:43.655]  But, no, that's part of the plan.
[02:34:43.695 --> 02:34:44.876]  Got to keep the slaves in line.
[02:34:45.297 --> 02:34:45.917]  J.R.
[02:34:46.037 --> 02:34:46.578]  in Texas.
[02:34:46.598 --> 02:34:47.138]  You're on the air.
[02:34:47.178 --> 02:34:48.039]  Go ahead, J.R.
[02:34:48.239 --> 02:34:49.060]  Hello, Alex.
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:49.780]  Can you hear me okay?
[02:34:49.940 --> 02:34:50.361]  Yes, sir.
[02:34:50.581 --> 02:34:51.021]  Okay, great.
[02:34:52.022 --> 02:34:54.024]  Yeah, congratulations, Alex, on martial law.
[02:34:54.144 --> 02:34:54.784]  I loved it.
[02:34:55.285 --> 02:34:58.728]  And I'm getting a lot of people excited about it, and I'm passing out copies all over the place.
[02:34:59.588 --> 02:35:04.032]  So, when you went to the website, you're a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, and you're burning copies?
[02:35:04.372 --> 02:35:04.673]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:04.713 --> 02:35:05.113]  That's correct.
[02:35:06.064 --> 02:35:06.304]  Right.
[02:35:06.885 --> 02:35:09.427]  And I wanted to share something with the listeners out there.
[02:35:10.267 --> 02:35:13.590]  I had kind of a brush with fascist America several months ago.
[02:35:14.351 --> 02:35:24.939]  The thing is I got into an accident on the highway here and my vehicle got damaged and I took the construction company to court just to get my damages right.
[02:35:25.580 --> 02:35:32.065]  And so basically they were giving me the run around and I finally got them into court and I blew away the defense.
[02:35:34.727 --> 02:35:37.648]  I totally defeated the attorney's arguments on their side.
[02:35:38.929 --> 02:35:41.670]  I had stacks of evidence, photos, audio recordings.
[02:35:42.510 --> 02:35:47.932]  I did everything short of taking the court on a time machine back to when the accident actually happened.
[02:35:48.892 --> 02:35:50.372]  The judge dismissed the case.
[02:35:51.052 --> 02:35:52.273]  He said there wasn't enough evidence.
[02:35:52.293 --> 02:35:55.074]  I had stacks of evidence, photos, audio recordings, everything.
[02:35:55.854 --> 02:35:57.414]  It was just obvious to me.
[02:35:57.715 --> 02:35:58.995]  I didn't realize until later.
[02:35:59.434 --> 02:36:03.835]  That this construction company was owned by a buddy of Rick Perry and George Bush.
[02:36:04.655 --> 02:36:08.596]  And so, I mean, it started to make sense later on.
[02:36:09.196 --> 02:36:10.476]  Well, that's all part of the freedom.
[02:36:10.496 --> 02:36:15.597]  When you get these mafias together, they just basically all get to run roughshod over the rest of us.
[02:36:16.057 --> 02:36:16.777]  Yep, yep.
[02:36:17.257 --> 02:36:19.377]  So, I mean, courts are useless now.
[02:36:19.517 --> 02:36:21.058]  I mean, even here at the county level.
[02:36:21.078 --> 02:36:23.278]  You know, it's just insane.
[02:36:24.758 --> 02:36:25.498]  It is, my friend.
[02:36:25.538 --> 02:36:26.759]  J.R., good to hear from you.
[02:36:27.459 --> 02:36:28.319]  Next up is...
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:30.180]  Who's up next?
[02:36:31.261 --> 02:36:32.282]  David in Louisiana.
[02:36:32.322 --> 02:36:32.922]  Go ahead, David.
[02:36:33.262 --> 02:36:34.003]  Yes, how are you doing?
[02:36:34.043 --> 02:36:35.023]  I'm enjoying the show.
[02:36:35.103 --> 02:36:35.603]  Well, thank you.
[02:36:36.004 --> 02:36:37.485]  Okay, I just wanted to call.
[02:36:37.505 --> 02:36:45.349]  I think you might be laboring under a little bit of a misconception about the anti-abortion protesters in the late 80s.
[02:36:45.909 --> 02:36:48.931]  Many of these people were not peaceful demonstrators.
[02:36:49.972 --> 02:36:56.155]  And I encountered some that were, but so many of them were not.
[02:36:56.555 --> 02:36:59.257]  They would attack women approaching clinics and trying...
[02:37:00.020 --> 02:37:01.921]  Block access to clinics.
[02:37:03.022 --> 02:37:08.846]  And, you know, even worse things than that, of course, you're familiar with the stories about bombings and shootings.
[02:37:09.006 --> 02:37:12.849]  So a lot of these people were not peaceful demonstrators.
[02:37:14.070 --> 02:37:29.300]  Let me stop you, because last hour I went into a video that I put on PrisonPlanet.tv of peaceful people having their arms broken purposefully by the police, and the police went on record and said they wouldn't get up and walk to the paddy wagon, so we broke their arms.
[02:37:30.060 --> 02:37:40.826]  Now, you can't dehumanize the pro-lifers and say, because some people shot and killed, some people bombed, and that came later, by the way, after the violence was escalated.
[02:37:40.846 --> 02:37:42.427]  I'm not condoning that.
[02:37:43.747 --> 02:37:51.651]  After all of that happened, again, to say, well, some of these people aren't nice, so we can do stuff to the other ones.
[02:37:52.092 --> 02:37:58.455]  I mean, I know pro-lifers who are peaceful, who've stood 100 feet from an abortion clinic in Austin and have been given six months in jail.
[02:37:59.961 --> 02:38:02.883]  So maybe your experiences were different.
[02:38:02.903 --> 02:38:03.763]  What was your experience?
[02:38:04.544 --> 02:38:12.007]  Well, I'm pro-choice and I was out in front of an abortion clinic arguing with some pro-livers.
[02:38:13.028 --> 02:38:22.452]  These were peaceful demonstrators and I'm sure there were many who were, but we've all heard and seen evidence of some of them who are not.
[02:38:22.472 --> 02:38:23.913]  Yeah, I mean, you're right.
[02:38:24.093 --> 02:38:27.695]  But just because some of them aren't, does that mean we get to break other people's arms?
[02:38:28.536 --> 02:38:36.881]  No, no, and sometimes, well, not sometimes, but a lot, the police overreact in many situations.
[02:38:36.921 --> 02:38:39.143]  Well, I'm going to tell you something, David.
[02:38:39.759 --> 02:38:40.900]  And I hope you'll listen to me.
[02:38:41.280 --> 02:38:50.864]  A lot of people who are pro-abortion, it's because they've paid for abortions, they've been involved in them, and they just cannot, it's kind of a mental block, cannot admit they were wrong.
[02:38:51.464 --> 02:39:01.708]  And I'm telling you, in a country where we have abortion as birth control, and abortion 50 million children, and then now let's get rid of the old people, but you know,
[02:39:02.468 --> 02:39:07.309]  Before that, it was Helen Keller's a hero, and now they want to get rid of Terry Shivo.
[02:39:07.329 --> 02:39:11.930]  I think you need to rethink and soften your heart a little bit about abortion.
[02:39:11.950 --> 02:39:12.631]  Do you have children?
[02:39:13.391 --> 02:39:13.611]  No.
[02:39:14.631 --> 02:39:17.112]  They are the most beautiful, wonderful creatures.
[02:39:17.192 --> 02:39:22.033]  If you want to see the image of God in man, then it's children.
[02:39:22.971 --> 02:39:33.340]  And, you know, this business of it's just some tissue, I assure you, sir, I mean, they've got babies being born three, four months premature that live and have great lives.
[02:39:33.981 --> 02:39:35.502]  And they say, well, nobody wants these babies.
[02:39:35.522 --> 02:39:36.003]  That's not true.
[02:39:36.023 --> 02:39:39.806]  People stand in line, you know, white couples, to get babies.
[02:39:40.663 --> 02:39:43.044]  Retarded black children or retarded white children.
[02:39:43.385 --> 02:39:48.928]  There is about exactly the same amount of abortions each year that there are people seeking to adopt.
[02:39:48.948 --> 02:39:57.173]  They're adopting children from Korea and Indonesia and just all over the place because people want children.
[02:39:57.553 --> 02:40:00.835]  And I would challenge women who are thinking about... By the way, it radically...
[02:40:01.235 --> 02:40:01.555]  I think.
[02:40:24.555 --> 02:40:28.357]  Because when you do that, that screws the woman up really bad.
[02:40:28.377 --> 02:40:30.277]  They get endometriosis, you name it.
[02:40:30.297 --> 02:40:32.878]  So it's also very dangerous for the women's lives.
[02:40:33.178 --> 02:40:40.921]  And there's never been, if a woman's about to die, going back 150 years, and they've got to do a surgery to save her, that's not called an abortion.
[02:40:40.961 --> 02:40:44.803]  So this thing of, in the case of the life of a woman, it's already like that.
[02:40:44.843 --> 02:40:48.544]  If somebody's going to die, the doctors save the woman.
[02:40:49.084 --> 02:40:51.225]  Okay, so now you can go ahead and make your comment.
[02:40:51.986 --> 02:40:52.546]  Okay, well I...
[02:40:53.459 --> 02:41:05.303]  It's hard to know where to begin, but I would begin with, you should make a distinction between a fetus and a baby that's already been born, and the reason why... Those are human beings, brother!
[02:41:05.323 --> 02:41:14.467]  You know the feds are trying to ban these 3D sonograms, not for health risks, because they literally do not want people to see these babies.
[02:41:16.286 --> 02:41:18.489]  Well, I haven't heard that.
[02:41:19.730 --> 02:41:20.852]  Oh, type it in.
[02:41:20.992 --> 02:41:24.196]  FDA seeks to restrict 3D sonograms.
[02:41:24.536 --> 02:41:33.527]  And also, another thing is that there's evidence that it's not true that abortion causes the health problems that you listed.
[02:41:33.547 --> 02:41:35.309]  Oh, come on.
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:37.701]  You've got to be joking.
[02:41:37.941 --> 02:41:49.285]  It would depend on, you know, whether if it's legal and done competently in a clean, safe facility, then many of the problems are things that date from the time when it was illegal.
[02:41:49.565 --> 02:41:51.966]  You know a woman can literally get about $100,000 to adopt out a healthy child?
[02:41:55.074 --> 02:41:58.976]  Instead, they go in there and pay $300 to terminate that child.
[02:41:59.577 --> 02:42:02.138]  Listen, I do not want this on my soul.
[02:42:02.158 --> 02:42:04.300]  Let me tell you something, man.
[02:42:04.820 --> 02:42:05.480]  I love life.
[02:42:05.600 --> 02:42:06.321]  Let me tell you something.
[02:42:06.681 --> 02:42:09.903]  You need to go have some children, and then you need to think about abortion after you've done that.
[02:42:11.284 --> 02:42:13.085]  I don't think you know until you've had a child.
[02:42:13.325 --> 02:42:15.445]  And they sell us on not having children.
[02:42:15.726 --> 02:42:17.266]  They sell us on not having families.
[02:42:17.386 --> 02:42:19.347]  It is the biggest fraud ever.
[02:42:19.387 --> 02:42:24.108]  These women are all unhappy at 40 years old, 50 years old, fighting to have kids.
[02:42:24.388 --> 02:42:26.869]  All these feminists, because they're not being made whole.
[02:42:26.969 --> 02:42:28.170]  We have a life cycle.
[02:42:28.390 --> 02:42:29.770]  We're meant to behave this way.
[02:42:30.070 --> 02:42:31.591]  Men and women are one species.
[02:42:31.631 --> 02:42:32.371]  We are the same.
[02:42:32.651 --> 02:42:33.391]  We are merged.
[02:42:33.431 --> 02:42:34.492]  We are whole together.
[02:42:36.118 --> 02:42:39.379]  This killing 50-something million kids, man, it's got to stop.
[02:42:40.159 --> 02:42:50.042]  Well, because we are conscious beings with the power of choice and self-determination, we then have the right to control our own bodies.
[02:42:50.822 --> 02:42:52.463]  That's also a right as well.
[02:42:52.503 --> 02:42:54.003]  That's part of the right to life.
[02:42:54.023 --> 02:42:57.444]  You can't have a right to life without that as being part of it.
[02:42:58.264 --> 02:43:01.245]  It's separate because you can say it's your body.
[02:43:01.325 --> 02:43:01.645]  It's not.
[02:43:01.665 --> 02:43:02.726]  It has a different blood type.
[02:43:03.046 --> 02:43:04.026]  It has its own heartbeat.
[02:43:06.586 --> 02:43:07.627]  Please, heaven help me.
[02:43:08.248 --> 02:43:12.751]  You know, we should have people not... It's unbelievable.
[02:43:14.072 --> 02:43:17.314]  Look, sir, you need to really think this through.
[02:43:17.334 --> 02:43:17.954]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:18.074 --> 02:43:20.496]  It makes my heart bleed.
[02:43:22.918 --> 02:43:25.640]  Man, I don't know what I can say to you.
[02:43:26.480 --> 02:43:30.503]  I hope God will move your heart and your soul to see the truth.
[02:43:31.756 --> 02:43:37.380]  And I bet money, I should have asked him the question, I bet that you've paid for a couple of abortions.
[02:43:39.281 --> 02:43:44.264]  And you've got to admit that what you did was wrong.
[02:43:45.365 --> 02:43:47.726]  You can get forgiveness for that.
[02:43:48.506 --> 02:43:53.610]  But, oh please, how warped have we gotten here?
[02:43:54.690 --> 02:43:56.932]  How far have we come with these arguments that...
[02:43:59.244 --> 02:44:01.426]  Just look at what's happened to our country since we started abortion.
[02:44:01.766 --> 02:44:05.748]  Look at the crime and the abuse of children and just all the evils.
[02:44:07.269 --> 02:44:08.870]  And this is a culture that loves death.
[02:44:08.910 --> 02:44:15.715]  I mean, now they're talking about killing babies up to age two, calling them mackerel, old people, worthless, retarded children, subhuman.
[02:44:15.735 --> 02:44:19.597]  These are the speakers the governor's conference has come and given speeches.
[02:44:19.958 --> 02:44:22.519]  And Bush is putting all his pro-abort people into positions of power.
[02:44:24.320 --> 02:44:25.061]  Man.
[02:44:26.402 --> 02:44:27.162]  What's in this?
[02:44:27.302 --> 02:44:27.623]  Come on.
[02:44:29.312 --> 02:44:30.833]  Life, that's what it's all about.
[02:44:31.494 --> 02:44:34.576]  These people, these women could have these babies and give them up.
[02:44:35.617 --> 02:44:43.743]  But they're so... And there's such a market for it, the CPS will go take a good family's children to give it to somebody else's family.
[02:44:45.344 --> 02:44:46.125]  Ron in New York.
[02:44:46.205 --> 02:44:46.886]  Ron, you're on the air.
[02:44:46.906 --> 02:44:47.966]  How you doing?
[02:44:47.986 --> 02:44:48.687]  A couple of points.
[02:44:49.568 --> 02:44:53.791]  The gentleman said the difference between a fetus and a baby, tissue, fetus.
[02:44:54.992 --> 02:44:56.353]  And you said that.
[02:44:56.903 --> 02:44:58.825]  It has a heartbeat, brain waves.
[02:44:59.245 --> 02:45:00.346]  It is not your body.
[02:45:00.426 --> 02:45:02.688]  It's a separate body in the woman's body.
[02:45:02.708 --> 02:45:03.029]  Yeah, I know.
[02:45:03.049 --> 02:45:06.732]  These sicko feminists call it a parasite.
[02:45:06.772 --> 02:45:07.753]  You're a parasite.
[02:45:09.374 --> 02:45:13.017]  Your mother didn't rip you out of that warm, safe place.
[02:45:14.619 --> 02:45:19.263]  The other thing, I sent you a copy of Sinatra's, that old song, The House We Live In.
[02:45:19.718 --> 02:45:20.819]  I don't know if you've received it yet.
[02:45:20.859 --> 02:45:21.800]  I sent it out Monday.
[02:45:21.840 --> 02:45:23.061]  I like that song.
[02:45:23.462 --> 02:45:23.982]  Did you hear it?
[02:45:24.222 --> 02:45:25.343]  No, I've heard the song.
[02:45:25.383 --> 02:45:26.204]  I haven't seen it yet.
[02:45:26.485 --> 02:45:27.445]  I think you're going to love it.
[02:45:27.465 --> 02:45:28.707]  Maybe you want to use it.
[02:45:28.747 --> 02:45:31.790]  I wrote a whole big letter to you to rally the people.
[02:45:31.870 --> 02:45:33.731]  It's a tremendous, inspiring thing.
[02:45:34.372 --> 02:45:37.275]  I also put on there Kate Smith's God Bless America.
[02:45:37.811 --> 02:45:40.212]  Which is another idea for you, but I explored that in a letter.
[02:45:40.232 --> 02:45:40.872]  You can read it.
[02:45:41.332 --> 02:45:47.615]  The thing is that one line in there says, The right to speak my mind out, that's American in me.
[02:45:47.635 --> 02:45:49.756]  You're going to love that when you hear that.
[02:45:50.016 --> 02:45:50.896]  No, I know the song.
[02:45:51.517 --> 02:45:52.497]  I like Frank Sinatra.
[02:45:52.517 --> 02:45:54.218]  I actually own a bunch of the records.
[02:45:54.438 --> 02:46:04.082]  The other point is, I think that there was a lot of talk today about Mark of the Beast, and it is for the uninformed in Revelation 14.9.
[02:46:05.535 --> 02:46:22.500]  A third angel followed them, said in a loud voice, If anyone worships the beast in his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, he too will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured out full strength into the cup of his wrath.
[02:46:22.520 --> 02:46:32.203]  He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb, and the smoke of their torment rises forever and ever.
[02:46:32.711 --> 02:46:41.799]  There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast in his image or for anyone who receives the mark of his name.
[02:46:43.380 --> 02:46:45.282]  I mean, it's pretty plain, Alex.
[02:46:45.442 --> 02:46:45.882]  I hear you.
[02:46:45.902 --> 02:46:46.703]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:47.183 --> 02:46:48.364]  Myron in Colorado.
[02:46:48.384 --> 02:46:49.185]  Go ahead, Myron.
[02:46:50.526 --> 02:46:51.687]  Warren, excuse me.
[02:46:51.707 --> 02:46:52.067]  Go ahead.
[02:46:52.388 --> 02:46:53.108]  Okay, real quick.
[02:46:53.929 --> 02:46:56.131]  Collective service, that means draft, doesn't it?
[02:46:56.931 --> 02:46:59.854]  Yeah, they've set all that back up and set up the draft boards again, yeah.
[02:47:00.456 --> 02:47:00.816]  Okay.
[02:47:00.856 --> 02:47:03.818]  You're not going to activate it all until they blow up a U.S.
[02:47:03.878 --> 02:47:04.158]  city.
[02:47:04.198 --> 02:47:05.018]  That is the globalist.
[02:47:05.398 --> 02:47:05.758]  Okay.
[02:47:06.099 --> 02:47:14.782]  Overnight, ESPN, the radio, has been, as a public service announcement, they've been saying how when you turn 18... It's the law.
[02:47:14.802 --> 02:47:15.443]  You've got to go do it.
[02:47:15.483 --> 02:47:16.323]  It's all over the place.
[02:47:16.543 --> 02:47:16.843]  Okay.
[02:47:17.123 --> 02:47:22.586]  Yeah, they, like, tripled the funding last year for selective service announcements.
[02:47:23.106 --> 02:47:23.406]  Okay.
[02:47:24.026 --> 02:47:26.347]  Kind of sign up to be conscript slaves.
[02:47:26.427 --> 02:47:27.188]  It's the law.
[02:47:27.791 --> 02:47:28.091]  Okay.
[02:47:28.171 --> 02:47:30.534]  I just was wondering if you knew anything about it.
[02:47:30.574 --> 02:47:34.217]  You know, you can't get student loans and student grants and things like that.
[02:47:35.358 --> 02:47:36.899]  You've got to register within 30 days.
[02:47:36.919 --> 02:47:38.921]  So, I just wondered.
[02:47:39.161 --> 02:47:39.461]  Thank you.
[02:47:40.522 --> 02:47:40.883]  You bet.
[02:47:40.923 --> 02:47:43.345]  And some of the bills they've got introduced, 18 to 49, 18 to 36, 18 to 26...
[02:47:47.634 --> 02:47:48.695]  Boy, I'll be drafted.
[02:47:50.316 --> 02:47:50.376]  18 to 49.
[02:47:50.616 --> 02:48:00.884]  And look, the reason I say that it's totally wrong is that they've got these... They test illegal inoculations.
[02:48:00.905 --> 02:48:01.505]  That's admitted.
[02:48:02.266 --> 02:48:05.008]  Stuff where you've got to, even if you're in the military, you haven't waived all your rights.
[02:48:06.129 --> 02:48:08.611]  Experimental vaccines, you've got to sign a waiver and agree.
[02:48:08.991 --> 02:48:10.072]  Consent, they still do it.
[02:48:11.593 --> 02:48:14.075]  The depleted uranium used...
[02:48:15.010 --> 02:48:20.572]  Not just in Iraq or Afghanistan or Serbia, but at least 10 different munitions grounds here in the U.S.
[02:48:20.592 --> 02:48:21.273]  Don't get near it.
[02:48:23.514 --> 02:48:32.457]  How they make them pay for their own meals, and when you get your legs blown off, your family's got to pay for your flight back from Ramstein because they discharge you right there, don't even give you a flight home.
[02:48:32.918 --> 02:48:39.480]  Hey, thanks for your legs you left back there in Iraq on that mine you stepped on with an improvised explosive device.
[02:48:40.021 --> 02:48:41.521]  Now, pay for your own plane ticket.
[02:48:42.402 --> 02:48:43.162]  Shut your mouth.
[02:48:46.013 --> 02:48:50.376]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.556 --> 02:48:54.979]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.119 --> 02:48:59.502]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.522 --> 02:49:00.883]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.665 --> 02:49:06.909]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.969 --> 02:49:13.897]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.017 --> 02:49:16.040]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:26.825]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.025 --> 02:49:32.407]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:52:06.649 --> 02:52:07.369]  Sorry to the others.
[02:52:07.449 --> 02:52:08.890]  He's General Payne.
[02:52:08.950 --> 02:52:10.410]  I guess he's not having localized Payne.
[02:52:11.231 --> 02:52:12.491]  General Payne, you're on the air.
[02:52:12.571 --> 02:52:13.031]  Go ahead.
[02:52:13.932 --> 02:52:15.572]  Info Warrior from your London branch.
[02:52:15.993 --> 02:52:16.813]  What's going on, buddy?
[02:52:17.393 --> 02:52:18.834]  Well, it's okay.
[02:52:19.514 --> 02:52:24.076]  I heard your conversation and you were giving us scants on the Mafioso business.
[02:52:24.596 --> 02:52:28.378]  First of all, in 1913, who did you lose your Federal Reserve to?
[02:52:29.471 --> 02:52:31.011]  You lost it to the Rothschilds.
[02:52:31.372 --> 02:52:34.413]  We lost ours some centuries before that to the Rothschilds.
[02:52:35.353 --> 02:52:43.595]  Before you say anything about anti-Semitism and that you're not anti-Semitic, and you've made that quite clear, let us just deal with the facts.
[02:52:44.296 --> 02:52:47.737]  The facts are, the Zionists have hijacked a religion.
[02:52:48.117 --> 02:52:49.197]  They are anti-Semitic.
[02:52:49.557 --> 02:52:54.099]  The ADL and the B'nai B'rith, or whatever they're called, should be, well, they're Zionists themselves.
[02:52:54.819 --> 02:52:55.839]  But that's where it lies.
[02:52:56.259 --> 02:52:58.480]  Anybody else who stands... The Bible...
[02:52:59.332 --> 02:53:07.358]  The Torah talks about the state of Israel being created by God.
[02:53:07.858 --> 02:53:09.239]  And good Jews follow that.
[02:53:09.800 --> 02:53:12.081]  Anybody else is not following the word of God.
[02:53:12.382 --> 02:53:13.082]  That's number one.
[02:53:15.224 --> 02:53:16.865]  I don't see anybody having a problem with that.
[02:53:18.086 --> 02:53:23.950]  Well, see, I call the Zionists, the hardcore ones, it's organized crime.
[02:53:24.702 --> 02:53:26.563]  So we're talking about Jewish Mafia.
[02:53:26.583 --> 02:53:33.706]  The Jewish Mafia has been good at acting like if you're against the Jewish Mafia, which everybody knows is the Jewish Mafia, boys and girls, you must be anti-Semitic.
[02:53:33.766 --> 02:53:37.448]  No, I mean, I'm not against the Italians because there's an Italian Mafia.
[02:53:38.171 --> 02:53:41.693]  But they all operate under one mafia, and that controls the bank.
[02:53:42.094 --> 02:53:49.899]  And if you know from the 17th century, anybody can run, forget the actual quote verbatim, but anybody can be a puppet like George Bush.
[02:53:49.919 --> 02:53:50.620]  You would call him a puppet.
[02:53:50.640 --> 02:53:53.762]  Yeah, I care not who runs the government or makes the laws.
[02:53:53.882 --> 02:53:55.303]  I care who controls the money, yeah.
[02:53:55.483 --> 02:53:57.664]  That's where it goes to, and the power is there.
[02:53:57.744 --> 02:54:01.327]  And the fact that they've hijacked a religion, and they don't believe in God,
[02:54:02.089 --> 02:54:05.472]  Because if they believed in God, they would not be a man-made state of Israel.
[02:54:05.912 --> 02:54:07.173]  I'm not anti-Semitic.
[02:54:07.573 --> 02:54:13.358]  I have neighbors... Well, that's what a lot of the Orthodox Jews say, and I... No, those are the Zionists.
[02:54:13.498 --> 02:54:13.858]  Know that.
[02:54:13.898 --> 02:54:16.240]  They're the Zionists, and the Zionists don't believe in a religion.
[02:54:16.500 --> 02:54:22.004]  They bully the proper Jews, and actually, you know, and I know, that they actually sold them.
[02:54:22.204 --> 02:54:25.246]  They sold them out to Hitler in 1941.
[02:54:25.507 --> 02:54:26.567]  No, that's admitted.
[02:54:26.728 --> 02:54:28.289]  Listen, I've got to let you go.
[02:54:28.369 --> 02:54:29.550]  I'm flat out of time here.
[02:54:29.890 --> 02:54:31.091]  Listen, I do appreciate the call.
[02:54:32.192 --> 02:54:36.554]  But there's the Ramadi Madness video out, says U.S.
[02:54:36.634 --> 02:54:39.615]  troops abusing Iraqis, but the Pentagon says that's no big deal.
[02:54:40.195 --> 02:54:46.138]  And, of course, in Iraq, they are still running the new TV show, Terror Confessions TV, Grip Baghdad.
[02:54:46.158 --> 02:54:54.161]  They openly have them all read these little prepared statements that all sound scripted with black eyes and bloody noses on TV every night, dozens of people.
[02:54:55.501 --> 02:54:59.663]  They call someone involved in robbery of a car called terrorists.
[02:55:01.218 --> 02:55:03.119]  And that's what our government has set up in Iraq.
[02:55:03.159 --> 02:55:04.659]  I mean, just a nightmare system.
[02:55:05.059 --> 02:55:05.999]  We are out of time.
[02:55:06.399 --> 02:55:07.780]  It was a great broadcast today.
[02:55:07.820 --> 02:55:09.180]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:55:09.540 --> 02:55:11.141]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:55:12.221 --> 02:55:16.522]  I really am proud of my new video, Martial Law 911 Rise of the Police State.
[02:55:16.542 --> 02:55:17.942]  Two hours, 35 minutes long.
[02:55:17.962 --> 02:55:19.043]  Really three films in one.
[02:55:19.063 --> 02:55:20.003]  It's my best work.
[02:55:20.543 --> 02:55:21.583]  You need to have this video.
[02:55:21.603 --> 02:55:23.604]  We cover the police state, the latest developments.
[02:55:24.144 --> 02:55:25.945]  It's the most powerful 9-11 film.
[02:55:26.005 --> 02:55:27.405]  That's a whole hour of it.
[02:55:28.186 --> 02:55:35.014]  And the last hour is about the Illuminati and who really controls it and the whole Nazi connection.
[02:55:35.815 --> 02:55:38.999]  It is powerful in how it connects into Schwarzenegger and the Bushes.
[02:55:40.120 --> 02:55:40.220]  It's $25.95.
[02:55:40.340 --> 02:55:43.023]  Look at two of my other videos.
[02:55:43.063 --> 02:55:43.624]  It drops down to $19.95.
[02:55:43.864 --> 02:55:46.768]  That's an $18 discount on the three-tape special.
[02:55:47.977 --> 02:55:49.598]  $24 discount on a 4-tape special.
