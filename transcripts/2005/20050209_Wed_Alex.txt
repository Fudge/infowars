[00:00:05.702 --> 00:00:06.362]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.003 --> 00:00:08.063]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.763 --> 00:00:09.883]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:11.364]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.104 --> 00:00:13.084]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.664 --> 00:00:17.325]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.845 --> 00:00:21.946]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:45.377]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:47.038 --> 00:00:47.879]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:48.559]  I'm your host.
[00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:51.581]  It's already Wednesday, the ninth day of February, 2005.
[00:00:51.661 --> 00:00:55.223]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:59.046]  We're scheduled to either have Ron Paul or his
[00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:11.053]  main press officer, Jeff Dice, on in the third hour to talk about a second National ID Card piece of legislation, H.R.
[00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:11.053]  418.
[00:01:11.934 --> 00:01:26.339]  They passed the National ID Card two months ago in December of 2004, but this new law beefs it up and makes it a Pan-American National ID Card.
[00:01:27.327 --> 00:01:27.967]  That's what they do.
[00:01:28.047 --> 00:01:32.830]  They pass it and then immediately, just like Patriot One, now there's Patriot Two.
[00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.411]  They're trying to pass Victory Acts.
[00:01:35.951 --> 00:01:38.393]  It's always about building and expanding.
[00:01:38.453 --> 00:01:39.513]  Never enough tyranny.
[00:01:39.553 --> 00:01:42.455]  So, we're going to talk about that coming up in the next segment in the third hour.
[00:01:43.095 --> 00:01:45.636]  We're going to be talking to the Congressman's office about it.
[00:01:45.936 --> 00:01:50.499]  They're scheduled to try to pass it today out of the House.
[00:01:52.296 --> 00:01:59.057]  Coming up, UK lines up Guantonimo style torture reality TV show.
[00:01:59.858 --> 00:02:01.398]  Where they're going to torture people.
[00:02:01.458 --> 00:02:02.738]  It's so much fun.
[00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:06.019]  All part of the ongoing conditioning process.
[00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.280]  Russia and China announce partnership to quote counter U.S.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.081]  Rove, that's Karl Rove, the great architect as they call him.
[00:02:18.951 --> 00:02:23.313]  Luciferians and Skull and Bones call somebody else the great architect as well.
[00:02:23.753 --> 00:02:25.915]  Roe finally gets his title in U.S.
[00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:26.555]  government.
[00:02:28.376 --> 00:02:33.398]  Also, Palestinian groups disavow truce, which just signed yesterday.
[00:02:33.658 --> 00:02:39.441]  And there's been a car bomb explode in Madrid as well.
[00:02:39.461 --> 00:02:46.525]  They're saying the World Cup in 2006 being accused for mega surveillance project using RFID.
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.662]  A report here out of USA Today with America at War, Hollywood follows, talking about the propaganda films.
[00:02:55.202 --> 00:02:57.143]  And the Drudge Report's talking about Bush.
[00:02:57.723 --> 00:03:01.664]  During one of these little stage town hall meetings, something went wrong.
[00:03:02.565 --> 00:03:12.408]  And while promoting Social Security reform with quote, regular citizens in Omaha, Nebraska, President Bush walked into an awkward, unscripted moment in which he stated that
[00:03:13.303 --> 00:03:16.947]  Carrying three jobs at a time is uniquely American, and you're absolutely right.
[00:03:17.267 --> 00:03:21.751]  If people want to keep their standard of living up, because things have dropped, you've got to work three jobs.
[00:03:22.312 --> 00:03:33.142]  While talking with audience participants, the President met Mary Morin, a woman in her late fifties who told the President she was divorced, mother of three, including a mentally challenged son.
[00:03:33.162 --> 00:03:34.203]  The President
[00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.033]  Comforted her on the security of Social Security, stating that the promises made will be kept by the government.
[00:03:42.453 --> 00:03:46.535]  But without prompting, she began to elaborate on her life circumstances.
[00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:48.335]  Here's the transcript.
[00:03:48.435 --> 00:03:48.735]  Ms.
[00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:53.477]  Morin, that's good because I work three jobs and I feel like I contribute.
[00:03:53.877 --> 00:03:55.358]  The President, you work three jobs.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:56.580]  Ms.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.002]  Morin, three jobs, yes.
[00:03:58.162 --> 00:03:58.662]  The President.
[00:03:58.842 --> 00:04:00.063]  Uniquely American, isn't it?
[00:04:00.183 --> 00:04:03.086]  I mean, that is fantastic that you're doing that.
[00:04:03.186 --> 00:04:03.766]  Applause.
[00:04:04.347 --> 00:04:05.228]  Get any sleep?
[00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:05.928]  Laughter.
[00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:09.812]  Yeah, that's the new freedom, folks.
[00:04:09.872 --> 00:04:10.212]  Working.
[00:04:10.232 --> 00:04:13.695]  I know a lot of people working 70 hours a week.
[00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:17.458]  And, you know, it's one thing to work 70 hours a week if you're getting ahead.
[00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:21.382]  It's another thing when almost everybody I know is working two jobs.
[00:04:21.962 --> 00:04:24.024]  And I mean people with multiple college degrees.
[00:04:24.986 --> 00:04:26.006]  Those jobs are gone.
[00:04:26.126 --> 00:04:29.847]  So they're bagging groceries, mowing lawns, painting houses.
[00:04:30.887 --> 00:04:32.268]  And, uh, there's a problem.
[00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:34.468]  They're working 70 hours a week.
[00:04:34.508 --> 00:04:36.689]  I'm working... conservatively.
[00:04:37.609 --> 00:04:37.909]  I don't know.
[00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:38.609]  It's gotta be over 80.
[00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.629]  No kidding.
[00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.070]  Uh, but, uh... What about their children?
[00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.710]  Well, don't worry.
[00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:47.491]  The television will raise them.
[00:04:48.531 --> 00:04:52.812]  No, working three jobs is not good, and it's not American.
[00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:54.695]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:04:54.775 --> 00:04:56.416]  Infowars.com's the website.
[00:04:56.436 --> 00:04:57.116]  Freshly updated.
[00:05:01.978 --> 00:05:02.419]  Hey, folks.
[00:05:02.519 --> 00:05:09.361]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.622 --> 00:05:14.363]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.584 --> 00:05:20.226]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:24.990]  Witness in horror, the execution of the September 11th attacks, and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:32.377]  Attachable society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.397 --> 00:05:33.197]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:05:33.217 --> 00:05:36.881]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:05:37.101 --> 00:05:39.603]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:05:39.843 --> 00:05:45.128]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroy
[00:05:45.128 --> 00:05:45.488]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.025 --> 00:06:09.652]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.872 --> 00:06:21.140]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.361 --> 00:06:24.023]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.363 --> 00:06:28.466]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:06:28.666 --> 00:06:30.807]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:32.827]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.027 --> 00:06:39.049]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:44.971]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:49.236]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.256 --> 00:06:49.957]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.977 --> 00:06:50.678]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.773 --> 00:07:04.915]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[00:07:05.115 --> 00:07:07.817]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[00:07:07.997 --> 00:07:09.378]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[00:07:09.558 --> 00:07:19.484]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[00:07:19.684 --> 00:07:21.425]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[00:07:21.705 --> 00:07:25.586]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[00:07:25.806 --> 00:07:30.248]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[00:07:30.428 --> 00:07:34.269]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:40.691]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[00:07:40.891 --> 00:07:43.612]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[00:07:43.872 --> 00:07:47.195]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassel one-year money-back guarantee.
[00:07:47.295 --> 00:07:51.158]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[00:07:51.278 --> 00:07:55.181]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:07:55.381 --> 00:07:59.644]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:03.607]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.168 --> 00:08:06.950]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:08.886 --> 00:08:15.143]  Alright, eight minutes, ten seconds into this first hour of this three hour global transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:16.636 --> 00:08:17.957]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:18.477 --> 00:08:37.609]  Coming up in about 10 minutes, we're going to be talking to local activists who are on the verge of recalling the mayor and defeating the centerpiece, the crown jewel of a federal program of national toll roads, where you'll all have transponders in your cars and pay the first year, when it starts, $1,800 per vehicle.
[00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:42.842]  It is unbelievable.
[00:08:42.902 --> 00:08:44.103]  It is a giant plan.
[00:08:44.143 --> 00:08:46.425]  Time Magazine a few months ago did a big report on it.
[00:08:46.485 --> 00:08:47.906]  It's part of the NAFTA highways.
[00:08:48.386 --> 00:08:49.447]  Every state highway.
[00:08:49.507 --> 00:08:50.928]  Almost all your city roads.
[00:08:51.228 --> 00:08:52.129]  Existing roads.
[00:08:52.249 --> 00:08:53.190]  Total nightmare.
[00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:54.411]  That's coming up.
[00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:58.654]  Then, in the second hour, we're going to be talking to Steve Peltier.
[00:08:59.394 --> 00:09:03.918]  Retired after a long and rich career with the CIA and then the Army War College.
[00:09:05.106 --> 00:09:14.530]  And he's a political scientist, and after a stint in journalism covering the Middle East, he became the CIA Senior Analyst at Laney during the Iran-Iraq War.
[00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:23.993]  At the Army War College, he and others studied Iraq's victory over Iran in minute detail, and he has written a number of books on how that feat was managed.
[00:09:24.693 --> 00:09:28.115]  And to give us the inside scoop on the coming World War III,
[00:09:29.602 --> 00:09:31.383]  And it's probably going to happen.
[00:09:31.423 --> 00:09:41.068]  Most analysts we've talked to, and we're talking former top Reagan administration, former Bush administration top people, former Clinton top folks, even people who've been involved in the Bush administration are saying this.
[00:09:41.408 --> 00:09:43.649]  That's why we've been focusing on it the last few weeks.
[00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:45.390]  That's coming up in the second hour.
[00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:53.575]  Third hour, we're going to either have Ron Paul or Jeff Deist from Congressman Ron Paul's office on to talk about HR-418.
[00:09:54.375 --> 00:09:57.957]  And details of this are on InfoWars.com right now.
[00:09:59.028 --> 00:10:03.470]  With an emergency alert put out by Congressman Ron Paul's office.
[00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:05.070]  We were contacted by them.
[00:10:05.510 --> 00:10:07.971]  Great folks saying, hey, I want you to help us try to defeat this.
[00:10:08.892 --> 00:10:17.735]  They passed a national ID card December 7, 2004, a day that will live in infamy, and it passed the Senate December
[00:10:18.499 --> 00:10:19.039]  Eighteen.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.660]  Another day that will live in infamy.
[00:10:21.001 --> 00:10:23.082]  You're thinking, well, why is there another National ID card?
[00:10:23.102 --> 00:10:31.426]  Well, you see, this one just set up federal standardization of the state driver's license through the NCIC database for the new National Sales Tax that's coming.
[00:10:32.167 --> 00:10:36.789]  You'll have to have it to have a job, and it sets up internal checkpoints, and it's bad enough.
[00:10:36.809 --> 00:10:37.770]  I mean, it's a nightmare.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.384]  But the monsters just get bigger, you know, each generation.
[00:10:42.784 --> 00:10:57.178]  And so now, two months later, just a few days shy of two months later, out of the furnace, into the pit of the Night Circle of Hell, comes HR-418, scheduled to pass today.
[00:10:57.987 --> 00:11:00.269]  Now this is Ron Paul's writing.
[00:11:00.549 --> 00:11:01.410]  I'm going to read.
[00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:03.691]  What's wrong with H.R.
[00:11:03.911 --> 00:11:03.691]  418?
[00:11:04.012 --> 00:11:09.736]  A bill, we are told, will stem the flow of illegal aliens through our porous borders.
[00:11:10.336 --> 00:11:11.197]  Which is not true.
[00:11:11.477 --> 00:11:14.599]  The last bill actually gave waivers for the illegal aliens.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.722]  For starters, it does nothing to stem the flow of illegal aliens.
[00:11:17.982 --> 00:11:19.063]  That's Ron Paul's comment.
[00:11:19.483 --> 00:11:20.784]  Instead, H.R.
[00:11:20.804 --> 00:11:21.705]  418 will.
[00:11:22.465 --> 00:11:27.109]  And he gives you three things, five things, six things that it will do.
[00:11:28.175 --> 00:11:28.915]  Are you ready?
[00:11:29.716 --> 00:11:31.456]  Establish a national ID card.
[00:11:31.596 --> 00:11:41.059]  Number two, establish a federally coordinated database of personal information on American citizens with Canada and Mexico or Pan-American ID card.
[00:11:41.839 --> 00:11:46.000]  Use the national ID to track American citizens when traveling outside the U.S.
[00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.621]  and within the United States.
[00:11:48.121 --> 00:11:50.022]  Four, redefine terrorism.
[00:11:50.382 --> 00:11:51.922]  Now listen carefully.
[00:11:52.422 --> 00:11:53.463]  Hold on to your hats.
[00:11:53.583 --> 00:11:54.583]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:11:55.203 --> 00:11:57.564]  Number four, redefine terrorism.
[00:11:58.564 --> 00:12:10.428]  In broad new terms, that could include members of firearms, rights, and anti-abortion groups, or other such groups as determined by whoever is in power at the time.
[00:12:11.408 --> 00:12:12.108]  Gun owners.
[00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:15.209]  Pro-lifers.
[00:12:15.229 --> 00:12:15.209]  5.
[00:12:15.369 --> 00:12:26.413]  Authorize the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to unilaterally expand the information included in driver's license, including such biometric information as retina scans and DNA information.
[00:12:27.068 --> 00:12:28.049]  That's right, it's in there.
[00:12:28.489 --> 00:12:31.652]  You want to get a driver's license, you've got to give a tissue swab from your cheek.
[00:12:32.072 --> 00:12:35.635]  We're going to have your biometric, uh, biological ID.
[00:12:35.775 --> 00:12:37.156]  That's what we talked about yesterday.
[00:12:37.657 --> 00:12:42.521]  And even radio frequency identification, RFIDs, tracking technology.
[00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:43.202]  That's where I'm from.
[00:12:43.862 --> 00:12:48.526]  Carry a driver's license with RFID and governmental officials will know you're whereabouts 24-7.
[00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:52.140]  Incredibly, H.R.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:57.942]  418 does nothing to solve the growing threat to national security posed by people who are already in the U.S.
[00:12:57.962 --> 00:12:58.462]  illegally.
[00:12:58.922 --> 00:13:00.343]  Instead, H.R.
[00:13:00.563 --> 00:13:02.484]  418 states what we already know.
[00:13:02.504 --> 00:13:08.166]  That certain people here, illegally, are deportable, but it does nothing to mandate deportation.
[00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:09.446]  H.R.
[00:13:09.646 --> 00:13:12.567]  418 fails miserably on the most critical issue.
[00:13:13.188 --> 00:13:16.529]  It's like the huge Homeland Security funding of last December.
[00:13:17.426 --> 00:13:21.988]  Put money in for 2,000 more Border Patrol to sweeten the deal so people would go for it.
[00:13:22.448 --> 00:13:27.189]  And then day one, I mean the day after they passed it, Ridge said, we're not going to fund that.
[00:13:27.209 --> 00:13:28.770]  We're going to use that money on something else.
[00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:39.353]  So they'll have these mega massive $100 million funding packages and then put a few hundred million into more Border Patrol and then just take it away.
[00:13:40.413 --> 00:13:41.774]  Just take it away the next day.
[00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:49.893]  And the national ID card they passed last year for federal standardization, now this bill gives you the details and the teeth of it.
[00:13:51.054 --> 00:13:52.275]  Kind of like a shark, you know.
[00:13:52.335 --> 00:13:57.219]  I mean, the teeth in the first one were really bad, but there's even bigger ones rolling forward.
[00:13:57.819 --> 00:13:58.980]  About ten times larger.
[00:13:59.901 --> 00:14:00.782]  Ten times worse.
[00:14:00.902 --> 00:14:04.985]  So, you know, as the monster grows, it's got to have teeth to fit its mouth.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:28.577]  But it actually gave a waiver to all illegal aliens in the United States that states and private corporations are to accept consular matriculus, which are now issued, I keep saying 30, that was two years old, it's now 48, I saw the numbers this weekend, 48 countries are issuing them that our government is accepting.
[00:14:29.528 --> 00:14:36.072]  Now, 800 plus cities and most of the states were already accepting it, but now the feds are saying, yes, this is acceptable.
[00:14:36.732 --> 00:14:48.859]  And last year I had the leader of the Republican Senate in Colorado on, who's been valiantly fighting this, and his staff, in one day, got him four fake consular matriculas under four different names.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.722]  Got them for himself, just to demonstrate this, and they cost them $24 apiece.
[00:14:54.802 --> 00:14:54.942]  So,
[00:14:59.184 --> 00:15:01.685]  We have less border patrol than we had before 9-11.
[00:15:02.245 --> 00:15:08.728]  On the southern border alone, in Texas alone, the Texas border sector, than in the Houston Chronicle, Austin American Statesman.
[00:15:10.248 --> 00:15:18.771]  We reported here, of course, before that, but then finally it was in the paper a couple years ago, that we lost over 2,000 border patrol in Texas alone.
[00:15:18.952 --> 00:15:19.312]  Why?
[00:15:19.712 --> 00:15:25.234]  Because they said, well, if you don't become an air marshal, you'll get $24,000 a year extra starting pay.
[00:15:28.576 --> 00:15:30.377]  On top of what a Border Patrol agent would get.
[00:15:32.699 --> 00:15:34.801]  And it's an easy job, just riding around on airplanes.
[00:15:36.302 --> 00:15:36.682]  That's it.
[00:15:37.323 --> 00:15:39.965]  Looking for suspicious activity, you know, busting people with drugs.
[00:15:40.425 --> 00:15:50.613]  Would you rather do that or sit out there on the border all by yourself with Mexican troops shooting at you in order to walk around in the rattlesnake infested bush picking up trash?
[00:15:50.673 --> 00:15:51.714]  That's your main job now.
[00:15:53.381 --> 00:15:55.142]  So, old part of the new freedom.
[00:15:55.482 --> 00:16:06.429]  And so the $2,000 they were going to put in for the northern and southern border wouldn't even replace what we lost in Texas on our, what, 200-mile stretch of border here.
[00:16:07.169 --> 00:16:08.350]  Wouldn't even replace that.
[00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:11.652]  But the neocons are all over talk radio.
[00:16:11.732 --> 00:16:13.833]  I've heard them going, we've got to pass this bill.
[00:16:14.757 --> 00:16:15.858]  HR 418.
[00:16:16.178 --> 00:16:17.619]  It's immigration reform.
[00:16:17.659 --> 00:16:18.920]  Don't call Bush a liberal.
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:19.520]  Why?
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.982]  He might be for amnesty, but at least he's for controlling it.
[00:16:23.062 --> 00:16:23.682]  No, he's not.
[00:16:24.203 --> 00:16:25.483]  It's all window dressing.
[00:16:27.985 --> 00:16:38.131]  You know, I remember hearing the chief neocon on talk radio as I drove down the road the day after they passed the national ID card in December.
[00:16:40.903 --> 00:16:47.229]  And he actually said, we have won a great victory, we've defeated the stupid liberals, they were against it, but Bush got it.
[00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.611]  That's just not true!
[00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:55.195]  More Democrats voted for it than Republicans!
[00:16:55.656 --> 00:17:02.502]  Out of the 60-something people in the House and, what was it, the 13 people in the Senate, almost all of them were Republicans.
[00:17:02.982 --> 00:17:05.204]  People like Congressman Coon and Paul.
[00:17:07.137 --> 00:17:07.737]  But it doesn't.
[00:17:08.217 --> 00:17:11.218]  Look, these neocons know you don't look at voting records.
[00:17:12.159 --> 00:17:12.539]  They know.
[00:17:12.559 --> 00:17:13.999]  It's just they lie to you.
[00:17:15.059 --> 00:17:17.920]  And the only reason they have credibility is because they point out the lies of the Democrats.
[00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.041]  Well, that's easy to do.
[00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:25.762]  It's like pointing out the lies of one tread of the tank, but not pointing out the lies of the other tread.
[00:17:26.263 --> 00:17:27.723]  It's all part of the same system.
[00:17:27.743 --> 00:17:30.644]  You know, two wings on a blackbird.
[00:17:31.536 --> 00:17:35.757]  Now the bird points out one wing and says it's bad, and then you go along with the other wing.
[00:17:36.157 --> 00:17:38.498]  How about we focus on the brain of this creature?
[00:17:39.898 --> 00:17:41.358]  We're losing this country, folks.
[00:17:41.398 --> 00:17:46.959]  We're losing this country because of the betrayal of the so-called conservatives.
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:51.280]  And, uh, it's all for you.
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:52.341]  It's all for Christians.
[00:17:52.381 --> 00:17:55.341]  Christians are being arrested all over the country for praying on street corners.
[00:17:56.081 --> 00:17:58.222]  Pro-lifers being arrested, being savaged.
[00:17:59.057 --> 00:18:01.279]  Uh, the training that homeschoolers are evil.
[00:18:01.619 --> 00:18:03.481]  Uh, the FEMA training that guns are bad.
[00:18:04.081 --> 00:18:05.582]  You know, that the Constitution's bad.
[00:18:05.622 --> 00:18:06.563]  I mean, I've got the video.
[00:18:06.583 --> 00:18:07.544]  I've got the training manuals.
[00:18:07.564 --> 00:18:09.125]  I've got the mainstream news articles.
[00:18:09.185 --> 00:18:09.925]  It's in my films.
[00:18:09.965 --> 00:18:10.746]  It's on the website.
[00:18:11.406 --> 00:18:12.727]  This is the reality!
[00:18:13.528 --> 00:18:16.130]  We're losing everything we've got!
[00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:18.852]  We're losing this country!
[00:18:19.493 --> 00:18:21.134]  I love America!
[00:18:22.429 --> 00:18:25.811]  And you sit there sucking your thumb, giggling at me on the street corner.
[00:18:25.851 --> 00:18:27.712]  I've been walking down the road and that neocon's laughed at me.
[00:18:28.012 --> 00:18:29.753]  Oh, Mr. Black Helicopter!
[00:18:30.614 --> 00:18:32.495]  Oh, you're just mad that Bush is in.
[00:18:32.515 --> 00:18:34.576]  And I'm like, what is wrong with you?
[00:18:34.596 --> 00:18:38.478]  And I hear him on radio.
[00:18:38.558 --> 00:18:40.459]  I'm so glad Bush is cutting the budget.
[00:18:40.479 --> 00:18:41.340]  The liberals are mad.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:43.461]  It's the biggest budget ever!
[00:18:44.542 --> 00:18:46.763]  You people are living in Alice in Wonderland.
[00:18:48.129 --> 00:18:49.170]  And so are the Democrats.
[00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:50.450]  Bush is evil!
[00:18:50.490 --> 00:18:51.711]  He's for the Patriot Act!
[00:18:51.971 --> 00:18:52.792]  Bush is evil!
[00:18:52.832 --> 00:18:54.192]  He's for National ID Cards!
[00:18:54.413 --> 00:18:55.073]  Bush is evil!
[00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:55.813]  He's for the war!
[00:18:56.133 --> 00:18:56.434]  Hey!
[00:18:56.734 --> 00:18:59.495]  The Democrats are out voting the Republicans for all that!
[00:19:00.496 --> 00:19:02.777]  You're just as delusional, just as stupid!
[00:19:04.198 --> 00:19:05.539]  Why don't you wake up?
[00:19:06.399 --> 00:19:08.280]  We can still save this country!
[00:19:09.861 --> 00:19:16.865]  But they're putting their control grid in and they're not going to move till the next big terror attack and it's going to be bad and the globalists are going to carry it out.
[00:19:17.566 --> 00:19:22.067]  You're going to cling to the globalists who are your attackers, who are your abusers.
[00:19:22.827 --> 00:19:24.688]  You're going to cling, and I'll take my right.
[00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:25.488]  Save me!
[00:19:25.928 --> 00:19:26.828]  Save me!
[00:19:27.908 --> 00:19:31.729]  I'll put a plastic flag made in China by a slave out on my door.
[00:19:32.549 --> 00:19:37.070]  And we'll be a big cult together, and we'll wrap ourselves in the flag.
[00:19:39.071 --> 00:19:40.271]  Insane Asylum.
[00:19:41.471 --> 00:19:43.732]  I want more troops in black masks.
[00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:48.230]  Later I'll tell you about this newscast I've got.
[00:19:48.270 --> 00:19:49.390]  I'm gonna air it tonight on TV.
[00:19:50.131 --> 00:19:52.391]  Where they had the troops out at Mardi Gras here in Texas.
[00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:53.032]  Just troops!
[00:19:53.632 --> 00:19:55.172]  And there's pictures of them just shoving people.
[00:19:55.913 --> 00:19:57.133]  Just all getting you conditioned.
[00:19:57.333 --> 00:19:59.774]  That's not American folks having troops on the street corners!
[00:20:01.375 --> 00:20:05.576]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[00:20:06.337 --> 00:20:07.577]  In business and socially.
[00:20:08.217 --> 00:20:14.601]  Your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:20:15.182 --> 00:20:16.923]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.

[00:20:26.349 --> 00:20:28.510]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[00:20:29.091 --> 00:20:31.112]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:20:31.692 --> 00:20:32.773]  And it's so easy.
[00:20:33.494 --> 00:20:35.495]  To learn, you simply listen.
[00:20:36.336 --> 00:20:36.896]  When you want,
[00:20:37.492 --> 00:20:37.712]  Hi, folks.
[00:20:37.732 --> 00:20:39.353]  Jack Brown here from Midas Resources.
[00:20:39.433 --> 00:20:39.934]  The real money folks.
[00:21:09.801 --> 00:21:11.723]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:21:12.224 --> 00:21:13.225]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:13.285 --> 00:21:14.687]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:21:14.727 --> 00:21:15.167]  A 5% increase.
[00:21:15.748 --> 00:21:18.090]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.374]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:21:31.064 --> 00:21:33.406]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:21:33.426 --> 00:21:36.689]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:37.309 --> 00:21:40.352]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:21:40.892 --> 00:21:46.057]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:48.619 --> 00:21:51.261]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.

[00:22:01.269 --> 00:22:02.050]  Terrorism!
[00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:02.950]  Terrorism!
[00:22:03.050 --> 00:22:09.134]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:22:09.374 --> 00:22:10.975]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:22:11.215 --> 00:22:13.697]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:22:14.077 --> 00:22:28.646]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:22:28.686 --> 00:22:29.006]  government.
[00:22:29.186 --> 00:22:30.967]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:22:31.347 --> 00:22:37.249]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:22:37.409 --> 00:22:41.890]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.

[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:07.303]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:23:07.624 --> 00:23:08.444]  Read the labels.
[00:23:08.865 --> 00:23:12.989]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:13.229 --> 00:23:17.413]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:17.793 --> 00:23:22.658]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.

[00:23:50.621 --> 00:23:53.023]  They railed against the crown with another ragtag band.
[00:24:15.928 --> 00:24:17.609]  Thank God for the Renegades!
[00:24:17.729 --> 00:24:25.771]  Alright, my friends, the next 35 minutes, we're joined by Linda Curtis and Jimmy Gardner.
[00:24:25.991 --> 00:24:26.591]  Now, we've had
[00:24:46.317 --> 00:24:50.799]  Mr. Costello on, who founded the Austin Toll Party, and now these have spread across the country.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:25:04.446]  And no matter where you live, whether it's New York, or Illinois, or Florida, or California, or Nevada, New Mexico, wherever you live, massive toll roads are going in.
[00:25:04.946 --> 00:25:08.428]  And in a nutshell, tolls were always put on a new road you'd build.
[00:25:08.468 --> 00:25:09.849]  They'd be there for five, ten years.
[00:25:10.069 --> 00:25:11.349]  When it was paid for, they were taken off.
[00:25:11.589 --> 00:25:12.670]  That's totally reasonable.
[00:25:13.869 --> 00:25:16.451]  A great way to not raise taxes, and hey, you want to use the road, do it!
[00:25:17.011 --> 00:25:17.812]  That's free market!
[00:25:17.872 --> 00:25:19.893]  That's founding father type stuff!
[00:25:21.314 --> 00:25:28.720]  But under federal plans, all over the country, we're going to have 6,000 miles of toll roads here in Texas, with Rick Perry, the so-called conservative.
[00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.621]  The whole nation has 7,000.
[00:25:30.801 --> 00:25:43.170]  Under this federally manipulated plan, they will give almost all the existing state and local roads to private companies, this is corporate looting, and you will have a transponder in your car,
[00:25:44.031 --> 00:25:46.193]  Just like in Europe now, they're putting in the satellite boxes.
[00:25:46.253 --> 00:25:48.214]  Arnold's calling for it in California.
[00:25:48.674 --> 00:25:50.215]  They've just passed a law in Oregon.
[00:25:50.235 --> 00:25:51.897]  New York's on the verge of passing a law.
[00:25:53.097 --> 00:25:55.279]  And for the average family, it'll be $1,800 a year.
[00:25:55.299 --> 00:25:56.900]  And the city doesn't even challenge that amount.
[00:25:58.821 --> 00:26:00.122]  The numbers are probably higher.
[00:26:01.443 --> 00:26:13.672]  And so, all of these major existing roads in Austin, paid for, you know, 50-year-old roads, in some cases older, are going to have huge toll roads on them.
[00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:17.671]  And when the transponder also tracks and traces where you go and what you do.
[00:26:17.991 --> 00:26:21.093]  And a few months ago in Illinois, I told you about this, folks, and now it's in the news.
[00:26:21.393 --> 00:26:26.975]  They said, alright, toll roads all over the state, and if you don't take a transponder, we're going to have one lane that's still cash toll.
[00:26:27.035 --> 00:26:28.016]  It will be double.
[00:26:29.816 --> 00:26:30.237]  Double.
[00:26:31.137 --> 00:26:32.718]  That's Chicago Tribune.
[00:26:33.478 --> 00:26:34.278]  Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:26:34.639 --> 00:26:34.959]  Double.
[00:26:36.639 --> 00:26:39.741]  And people went and got their transponders by the millions.
[00:26:40.801 --> 00:26:42.422]  Now that's coming to Austin, Texas.
[00:26:43.587 --> 00:26:47.611]  And now city council people have gone public and admitted that, okay, it's all a fraud.
[00:26:47.631 --> 00:26:48.692]  I mean, I've got it right here in the paper.
[00:26:48.712 --> 00:26:51.614]  They're writing editorials going, okay, you know, here's the documents.
[00:26:51.654 --> 00:26:52.415]  We have plenty of money.
[00:26:52.655 --> 00:26:53.556]  The state had plenty of money.
[00:26:53.816 --> 00:26:54.757]  It's marked confidential.
[00:26:54.777 --> 00:26:55.898]  We're not supposed to tell you.
[00:26:56.619 --> 00:26:58.921]  They're starting to panic because of big recalls going.
[00:26:59.401 --> 00:27:02.324]  Booster McCracken has scurried back to our camp.
[00:27:03.064 --> 00:27:04.766]  The arrogant Mayor Will Wynne hasn't.
[00:27:05.626 --> 00:27:12.031]  And then it's in the Statesman, DA Investigates, CT, RMA, allegations of bribery and fraud.
[00:27:12.452 --> 00:27:14.433]  It's in the Oak Hill Gazette.
[00:27:15.234 --> 00:27:16.595]  I mean, there's a bunch of people saying this.
[00:27:16.615 --> 00:27:19.317]  And then there's obvious stuff like board members of different state boards.
[00:27:19.637 --> 00:27:33.008]  The day, understand this, the day after they, you know, just classic stuff, pass the toll roads with this unelected board, then their family members get huge lucrative jobs for the private toll company.
[00:27:33.188 --> 00:27:33.909]  Still, the day after.
[00:27:34.589 --> 00:27:35.150]  It's amazing.
[00:27:36.194 --> 00:27:38.695]  But just good old classic stuff's going on.
[00:27:39.136 --> 00:27:42.217]  Jimmy Gardner, who I've known for about five years, was out there.
[00:27:42.237 --> 00:27:43.298]  There's a picture of him in the paper.
[00:27:43.338 --> 00:27:45.359]  It's on InfoWars.com in his little toll booth.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.880]  His little booth fighting the toll booths.
[00:27:49.421 --> 00:27:51.462]  And he's there getting signatures to recall the mayor.
[00:27:51.502 --> 00:27:52.162]  It's neck and neck.
[00:27:53.182 --> 00:27:59.085]  And what he later learned was that one of the mayor's chief assistants waddles over and
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:04.101]  Well, I was out there collecting signatures from my petitions.
[00:28:26.585 --> 00:28:34.810]  And a gentleman came up to me and he took exception to the information I was putting out, namely what was part of the toll road plan, what was not.
[00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:42.474]  And we, you know, I'm trying not to argue with the guy because I'm a man on a mission there trying to get signatures for my petition.
[00:28:42.574 --> 00:28:45.535]  You're out front the Whole Foods and book people down on 6th Street.
[00:28:46.016 --> 00:28:46.456]  Exactly.
[00:28:46.476 --> 00:28:49.498]  A lot of people walking by, great place to get signatures.
[00:28:50.018 --> 00:28:53.660]  And so this guy took exception and he said, look, I'll bet you that
[00:28:54.207 --> 00:29:00.170]  Mopac, which is our main commuter highway on the west side of the city, he said, I bet Mopac is not part of the plan.
[00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:07.793]  I'll call one of the Campo board members on my cell phone right now and let you talk to her.
[00:29:08.273 --> 00:29:11.075]  So I said, look, I'm not really interested in betting
[00:29:12.011 --> 00:29:16.073]  But Jimmy, we don't have a lot of time, so to make a long story short, that's how they ease you into it.
[00:29:16.353 --> 00:29:17.934]  Then later, what did he finally say to you?
[00:29:18.254 --> 00:29:26.477]  Well, finally, when he realizes, you know, I don't want to bet him, don't really want to have much to do with him, he says, how many signatures do you have on your petitions there?
[00:29:26.918 --> 00:29:29.479]  And I said, oh, I probably got 10 on the table here.
[00:29:30.139 --> 00:29:31.340]  And he said, tell you what I'll do.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:34.841]  You've seen the $200, because he'd already flashed the cash to me.
[00:29:35.281 --> 00:29:40.884]  And he said, I'll give you $200 if you give me those petitions right there.
[00:29:41.514 --> 00:29:44.017]  And if you pack up your table and go home right now.
[00:29:44.137 --> 00:29:46.740]  We'll hear what happens when we get back and talk to Linda Curtis.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:48.221]  Stay with us, Jimmy.
[00:29:48.381 --> 00:29:49.122]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.765 --> 00:29:52.686]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.166 --> 00:29:54.768]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.788 --> 00:29:58.372]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:09.287]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.707 --> 00:30:13.933]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:30:14.173 --> 00:30:21.162]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.562 --> 00:30:27.668]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.688 --> 00:30:29.069]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:32.332]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:32.492 --> 00:30:34.514]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:34.814 --> 00:30:42.060]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:42.361 --> 00:30:45.744]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:30:46.164 --> 00:30:49.288]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:30:49.308 --> 00:30:49.408]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.428 --> 00:30:49.549]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.669 --> 00:30:50.510]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:50.570 --> 00:30:50.830]  Call today.
[00:31:01.207 --> 00:31:08.713]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:31:08.994 --> 00:31:19.903]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:31:21.404 --> 00:31:25.567]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[00:31:25.908 --> 00:31:36.356]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[00:31:36.656 --> 00:31:37.157]  That's right.
[00:31:37.337 --> 00:31:44.463]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:31:44.743 --> 00:31:48.867]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[00:31:49.047 --> 00:31:53.490]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:53.550 --> 00:31:53.991]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.921 --> 00:32:04.422]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:32:05.062 --> 00:32:14.304]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:32:15.224 --> 00:32:22.046]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:32:22.926 --> 00:32:24.366]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:32:24.606 --> 00:32:27.647]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[00:32:28.624 --> 00:32:37.167]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one year subscription to News Watch Magazine.
[00:32:38.028 --> 00:32:39.588]  Just call our toll free number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:32:39.608 --> 00:32:39.948]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:32:52.046 --> 00:32:52.627]  Call now.
[00:32:52.827 --> 00:32:59.376]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:33:04.537 --> 00:33:07.039]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[00:33:07.539 --> 00:33:10.281]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.741 --> 00:33:14.223]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.663 --> 00:33:16.004]  Yeah, why shouldn't we worry?
[00:33:16.024 --> 00:33:21.808]  Because evil always fails, corruption always implodes, the truth always comes out in the end.
[00:33:21.848 --> 00:33:27.051]  You try to bury it, it will finally erupt with such force as to destroy everything in its path.
[00:33:27.972 --> 00:33:30.193]  That's paraphrasing a French philosopher, but
[00:33:31.115 --> 00:33:32.636]  Look, why are we talking about toll roads?
[00:33:32.677 --> 00:33:34.198]  These aren't just your regular toll roads.
[00:33:34.718 --> 00:33:43.426]  All over the country, from California to New York, from sea to shining sea, north, south, east and west, new toll roads on your existing highways.
[00:33:44.407 --> 00:33:50.253]  And these interstate corridors, I've been up in Oklahoma and Kansas and places where they block off for 50, 60 miles.
[00:33:50.653 --> 00:33:52.895]  Everything, all these ghost towns to your left and right.
[00:33:53.576 --> 00:33:56.899]  McDonald's and gas stations built in the middle, taxed by the state.
[00:33:57.756 --> 00:34:00.142]  You can't get off the road, you can't get on the road.
[00:34:00.162 --> 00:34:03.751]  That's what Texas is going to be like, California, all your states.
[00:34:04.622 --> 00:34:09.304]  And, of course, it's our so-called conservative, Rick Perry, running this in Texas.
[00:34:09.324 --> 00:34:13.746]  Your so-called conservative, Lord Schwarzenegger, doing it out in California.
[00:34:13.766 --> 00:34:15.086]  It's the new age of taxation.
[00:34:15.346 --> 00:34:16.747]  They know you gotta have your car.
[00:34:16.807 --> 00:34:18.307]  Our society's built around cars.
[00:34:19.268 --> 00:34:20.008]  We're not like Europe.
[00:34:20.028 --> 00:34:25.770]  These compact cities were big, sprawling metropolitan areas, you know, in between huge masses of rural areas.
[00:34:26.250 --> 00:34:26.931]  This is big.
[00:34:26.951 --> 00:34:29.512]  I mean, our Chicago listeners know well about this.
[00:34:30.052 --> 00:34:31.852]  Don't take the transponder, double the toll.
[00:34:31.892 --> 00:34:33.213]  Toll roads going in everywhere.
[00:34:33.860 --> 00:34:35.061]  You're fighting against that as well.
[00:34:35.081 --> 00:34:36.022]  This is happening all over.
[00:34:36.862 --> 00:34:43.928]  And so, we have this pattern, though, of just alleged bribery here, alleged bribery there, payoffs here, payoffs there.
[00:34:44.329 --> 00:34:46.771]  And then somebody I know, talk about small world,
[00:34:49.218 --> 00:34:52.740]  He's just out there in front of uh... I know Jimmy for months has been out doing this.
[00:34:53.121 --> 00:35:01.706]  Jimmy's out there on his own time getting signatures as he believes in freedom and here comes this person walking over to him in front of all these witnesses doing this.
[00:35:02.387 --> 00:35:12.233]  Uh... let's go now and we'll bring Jimmy back up uh... but first and we'll finish up the story of the uh... what he's saying he's alleging and I believe him uh... this attempted bribery.
[00:35:12.653 --> 00:35:16.476]  He's been to the DA's office and the rest of it and again it's in the paper it's on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:16.736 --> 00:35:17.957]  Let's go to Linda Curtis
[00:35:18.697 --> 00:35:22.641]  Who's the coordinator for the petition drive for the Austin Poll Party.
[00:35:23.101 --> 00:35:24.802]  Linda, thanks for joining us.
[00:35:26.003 --> 00:35:26.884]  Thanks for having me.
[00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:27.464]  How are you doing?
[00:35:27.705 --> 00:35:28.325]  I'm doing great.
[00:35:28.345 --> 00:35:37.813]  Why don't you fire out the website and how folks in Central Texas can get involved, even if you're not an Austin voter, and the hurdle you're up against.
[00:35:38.093 --> 00:35:42.396]  I mean, this is sudden death overtime, neck and neck, to get enough of these signatures.
[00:35:43.217 --> 00:35:46.560]  Yes, and it doesn't help to get interference from the powers that be.
[00:35:47.684 --> 00:35:51.807]  So here's what people can do around the country and world that are listening to the show.
[00:35:51.867 --> 00:35:58.931]  You can go to our website austintollparty.com and make a financial contribution of whatever you can.
[00:35:59.951 --> 00:36:14.200]  You can also, no matter where you live, including of course Central Texas, you can go to the website, send all your friends to the website, and download the petition and get your friends that are registered voters in Austin to sign it.
[00:36:15.106 --> 00:36:21.550]  And then bring it, if you're here in Central Texas, bring it to the CAMPO meeting this Monday night.
[00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:25.252]  We're calling this the Valentine's Day Massacre of the Texas Toll Plan.
[00:36:25.832 --> 00:36:29.374]  The showdown is coming this Monday night starting at 6 p.m.
[00:36:30.214 --> 00:36:37.318]  The CAMPO is meeting and they're going to have to answer questions put to them by some of the people that we've actually been trying to recall.
[00:36:38.299 --> 00:36:43.622]  Brewster McCracken has been now asking the right questions he should have asked at the get-go.
[00:36:44.272 --> 00:36:46.756]  Well, he's released the documents, the tax documents.
[00:36:46.776 --> 00:36:49.640]  They've got plenty of money to giant corporate looting up.
[00:36:50.341 --> 00:36:50.922]  Definitely.
[00:36:51.202 --> 00:36:54.006]  So if you bring those signatures there, we need to fill the hall.
[00:36:54.026 --> 00:36:54.948]  There's about a thousand.
[00:36:55.424 --> 00:37:01.549]  There's room for a thousand people and we all want to show up with our petitions and shake them at those Campo board members.
[00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:06.792]  And we're talking about billions, billions of profits for them just in Central Texas alone.
[00:37:07.733 --> 00:37:08.954]  So that's coming up Monday night.
[00:37:08.974 --> 00:37:09.535]  Tell folks where.
[00:37:09.555 --> 00:37:14.158]  Monday night at the LBJ Auditorium at UT Campus here in Austin.
[00:37:14.838 --> 00:37:16.099]  25th and Red River.
[00:37:16.139 --> 00:37:18.101]  There's plenty of free parking over there.
[00:37:18.281 --> 00:37:19.342]  Show up at 6 o'clock.
[00:37:20.354 --> 00:37:23.097]  If you're getting signatures, you have to have them notarized.
[00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:25.538]  We will have notaries there at our table up front.
[00:37:26.259 --> 00:37:30.442]  Just check in with us, have them notarized, and go on in and sit down and watch the show.
[00:37:30.462 --> 00:37:32.064]  You guys have got the $35,000.
[00:37:32.124 --> 00:37:38.289]  The problem is you need to get another $15,000 to get $50,000 in the next couple weeks because you know they're going to throw out a bunch of your signatures.
[00:37:46.445 --> 00:37:53.007]  Right on, and yes, we're getting so many signatures in now, we really don't know exactly what our count is.
[00:37:53.067 --> 00:37:54.567]  We're counting them as we speak.
[00:37:54.627 --> 00:37:56.687]  You were telling me last night it's around 35,000.
[00:37:56.968 --> 00:38:02.889]  Yeah, we're overloaded with processing here at the office.
[00:38:03.549 --> 00:38:08.310]  So those people who live in the area, if you want to help out any time during the day or evening, we're open here.
[00:38:08.350 --> 00:38:10.591]  Come on in and we can use your help.
[00:38:11.656 --> 00:38:19.038]  We're down at UT right now petitioning as well, so those students that are listening or folks that are in the UT area, we need lots of help down at UT.
[00:38:19.139 --> 00:38:25.701]  And folks around the country, in California or Illinois or Florida, wherever this is happening, duplicate what the Austin Poll Party is doing.
[00:38:26.321 --> 00:38:27.761]  I mean, this is a national fight.
[00:38:28.362 --> 00:38:29.182]  This is serious.
[00:38:30.166 --> 00:38:37.810]  Okay, they're now announcing you're going to have to have a transponder in your car that automatically detects your account as you drive through different taxing authorities.
[00:38:37.970 --> 00:38:38.731]  This is the plan.
[00:38:38.771 --> 00:38:41.732]  You want to fight this, or do you want to suck your thumb and let this happen?
[00:38:42.113 --> 00:38:44.094]  Now, I want to get back into what's happened.
[00:38:44.414 --> 00:38:45.975]  Try to condense it for us, Lyndon.
[00:38:46.015 --> 00:38:53.219]  I want to go back to my good buddy, Jimmy, and let him finish the story of where he's talking about this attempted bribery that he's alleging.
[00:38:53.639 --> 00:38:56.000]  And there were witnesses there that saw this guy talking to him.
[00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.801]  That's now admitted that he was talking to him.
[00:39:00.026 --> 00:39:03.968]  Just basically what the toll roads are and what they've been trying to do.
[00:39:03.988 --> 00:39:08.731]  There's seven toll roads that we found out initially about.
[00:39:08.751 --> 00:39:11.293]  We meaning a guy named Sal Costello.
[00:39:11.873 --> 00:39:13.974]  Sal's just a regular guy here in Austin.
[00:39:14.615 --> 00:39:18.137]  He finds out about this bridge that's being proposed in his neighborhood.
[00:39:18.337 --> 00:39:19.478]  My neighborhood too, yeah.
[00:39:19.698 --> 00:39:19.958]  Okay.
[00:39:20.238 --> 00:39:23.980]  I won't be able to go anywhere more than a half mile without paying a toll.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.181]  I'm literally going to be in a cage.
[00:39:25.361 --> 00:39:28.543]  Right, you go get some groceries and you've got to pay a toll.
[00:39:28.894 --> 00:39:35.017]  So, he started raising questions about it and then found out that it was connected to seven, a total of seven toll roads.
[00:39:35.497 --> 00:39:38.679]  Now, the problem with these roads... Now the number's up at 14, but go ahead.
[00:39:38.739 --> 00:39:39.979]  Now it's up to, I think, 11.
[00:39:42.842 --> 00:39:45.303]  Okay, now I could be wrong on that, but maybe you're right, 14.
[00:39:45.444 --> 00:39:47.485]  It keeps growing.
[00:39:47.505 --> 00:39:53.488]  Well, see, I'm counting some of those that they go, oh, those aren't in Austin, because they're on the Austin City line.
[00:39:53.588 --> 00:39:54.869]  Exactly, you're right about that.
[00:39:54.929 --> 00:40:01.192]  And actually this week they said they were going to put a toll on a federal highway, I-35, which is really freaking people out.
[00:40:01.212 --> 00:40:01.933]  Well, they already do.
[00:40:01.993 --> 00:40:05.215]  I mean, go up to Kansas, go up to Oklahoma, go up to Missouri.
[00:40:05.235 --> 00:40:05.875]  It's a nightmare.
[00:40:06.542 --> 00:40:07.823]  Yes, so here's the thing.
[00:40:08.043 --> 00:40:15.808]  Four of the initial seven roads have already been paid for, and TxDOT has been saying, well yeah, that one's been paid for.
[00:40:15.888 --> 00:40:17.048]  No, it hasn't been paid for.
[00:40:17.088 --> 00:40:20.030]  They've been kind of like a shell game, trying to just drive everybody crazy.
[00:40:20.050 --> 00:40:22.572]  Well, McCracken wrote an editorial on January 31st.
[00:40:22.592 --> 00:40:32.137]  It's smart to question the toll road numbers, and he admits this, quote, TxDOT confidential marked documents, marked secret, that say we got plenty of money.
[00:40:32.637 --> 00:40:32.798]  Right.
[00:40:32.838 --> 00:40:34.859]  Now, if the hearing on Monday
[00:40:35.439 --> 00:40:50.911]  TxDOT has now been ordered to come with clear answers to the questions that both McCracken and Thomas now, Danny Thomas, one of the council members we've been recalling, Danny's now starting to realize that he was told maybe not the truth.
[00:40:52.112 --> 00:40:53.793]  I'm stating this as carefully as I can.
[00:40:53.833 --> 00:41:03.961]  Of course, McCracken voted to give up city authority for this non-elected state board, and now he's flip-flopped and is out fighting it, but not arrogant will win the twit mayor.
[00:41:04.747 --> 00:41:04.967]  Right.
[00:41:05.007 --> 00:41:15.715]  Will Wynn is now, I think, his office is covering for this gentleman that works in the office who's been going around harassing people and trying to stop our petition drivers.
[00:41:15.735 --> 00:41:15.975]  That's right.
[00:41:16.015 --> 00:41:17.557]  This isn't the only report of this.
[00:41:17.577 --> 00:41:23.361]  I don't want to get too much into how we're documenting this because we're, you know, well, you guys are just better.
[00:41:23.381 --> 00:41:24.802]  We're going to expose you, don't worry.
[00:41:25.663 --> 00:41:28.865]  But some of the other things that people are alleging he's doing to them.
[00:41:30.327 --> 00:41:31.087]  I'm sorry, I missed that?
[00:41:31.368 --> 00:41:36.570]  Well, you know, how he's going and getting in front of people, other people out getting signatures.
[00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:36.871]  Right.
[00:41:37.811 --> 00:41:42.594]  There's a guy that has, for the last couple of days, been showing up over at the county clerk's office.
[00:41:42.734 --> 00:41:49.958]  He's been paid by a political action committee that's headed up by a guy named Tim Taylor.
[00:41:50.058 --> 00:41:54.660]  He's formerly with the Real Estate Council, which is the big developers.
[00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:59.143]  They're the people, along with certain members of the Chamber of Commerce,
[00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:02.411]  who are pushing these toll roads.
[00:42:03.372 --> 00:42:07.353]  This kid who's been showing up over at the county clerk's office, he's being paid by these guys.
[00:42:07.693 --> 00:42:11.054]  He's trying to block people from signing our petitions.
[00:42:11.794 --> 00:42:18.156]  So this is the kind of skullduggery that's going on, and people, y'all need to just say, enough is enough.
[00:42:18.296 --> 00:42:19.696]  Well, they must be desperate, though.
[00:42:19.716 --> 00:42:24.498]  This is like old-fashioned New York corrupt politics with the goons.
[00:42:24.798 --> 00:42:27.939]  I got trained as an organizer in the South Bronx in New York.
[00:42:29.566 --> 00:42:34.668]  The first campaign I worked on, they were running around with lead pipes, trying to intimidate our campaign workers.
[00:42:34.748 --> 00:42:37.469]  So, I haven't seen anything like that since 1979.
[00:42:38.049 --> 00:42:39.269]  That was in New York.
[00:42:39.789 --> 00:42:42.950]  This is the kind of stuff they do in Austin, Texas now, apparently.
[00:42:43.050 --> 00:42:44.791]  And the people need to stand up and say,
[00:42:45.379 --> 00:42:46.139]  Enough is enough.
[00:42:46.179 --> 00:42:49.920]  Well, we're talking about, what, 1.3 billion just in the first few years.
[00:42:49.940 --> 00:42:54.401]  1.3 billion, here in the paper it says, just in profits for these people.
[00:42:54.781 --> 00:42:56.662]  I mean, that's just Austin, folks.
[00:42:56.682 --> 00:42:57.942]  The whole state's having this put in.
[00:42:58.402 --> 00:43:04.463]  And, Linda, before we go back to Jimmy, they've said in Washington, they've said all over, Austin is the test.
[00:43:04.523 --> 00:43:11.765]  If they can do this here, toll roads all over the major roads to get anywhere in the town, that if Austin falls,
[00:43:12.412 --> 00:43:19.215]  You know, if Midas Tirith falls, the forces of Mordor are going to be able to win all over the place.
[00:43:19.555 --> 00:43:24.137]  And I talked about that on TV last night with you, and you seconded that that's the info you've got.
[00:43:25.038 --> 00:43:25.298]  Yes.
[00:43:25.638 --> 00:43:26.859]  Hey, Alex?
[00:43:27.279 --> 00:43:27.519]  Yes?
[00:43:27.659 --> 00:43:33.622]  I just got a report in that there's interference going on right now at the tax office.
[00:43:33.642 --> 00:43:37.083]  So, Jimmy's listening.
[00:43:37.103 --> 00:43:40.585]  I don't know who else is listening, but they know what they're supposed to do.
[00:43:41.454 --> 00:43:42.654]  And I can't get off the phone.
[00:43:43.255 --> 00:43:46.155]  So, anyway, just wanted to announce that.
[00:43:47.496 --> 00:43:49.376]  Okay, so I want to go back to Jimmy real quick.
[00:43:49.416 --> 00:43:55.318]  Jimmy, you're there, this guy comes up, starts flashing $200 bills, going, hey, I bet you you're wrong, I bet you.
[00:43:55.538 --> 00:43:59.940]  Puts you on the phone with a Campo board member, they go, well, actually, probably is going to be a toll road on Mopac.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:06.082]  Well, and then finally he just comes to the point, repeat what he said to you with these $200 bills in his hand.
[00:44:06.882 --> 00:44:07.562]  Well, he said,
[00:44:08.516 --> 00:44:10.797]  You know, he asked me how many signatures I had.
[00:44:11.077 --> 00:44:12.038]  I said, I got about 10.
[00:44:12.318 --> 00:44:18.460]  He said, why don't you give me those petitions right there, pack your table up, go home, and I'll give you $200.
[00:44:19.261 --> 00:44:22.322]  And I was momentarily shocked at something like that.
[00:44:22.902 --> 00:44:23.923]  And so I hesitated.
[00:44:23.943 --> 00:44:26.264]  I said, look, I don't want your money.
[00:44:26.964 --> 00:44:29.985]  All you're trying to do is disrupt things out here.
[00:44:30.465 --> 00:44:33.307]  I said, the problem, at that point, I knew he'd crossed the line.
[00:44:33.407 --> 00:44:36.048]  So I got a little cocky with him and I said,
[00:44:36.525 --> 00:44:45.813]  Hey, the problem with you political types is that you're used to walking around with a stack of bills and paying people off to have people do your bidding.
[00:44:46.313 --> 00:44:47.394]  I'm not for sale, buddy.
[00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:53.527]  And I figured that would shut him down, but he continued for like another 10 or 15 minutes after that.
[00:44:53.587 --> 00:44:56.729]  So last night you said a total of 45 minutes he's in your face.
[00:44:57.009 --> 00:44:57.249]  Right.
[00:44:57.709 --> 00:44:58.770]  And this is a big guy.
[00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:59.790]  Were you getting signatures?
[00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:04.512]  All the 350 pound, you know, 6 foot 2 guys leaning over you?
[00:45:04.953 --> 00:45:10.295]  Well, I would say it reduced my number of signatures quite a bit while he's standing there setting a pick.
[00:45:11.013 --> 00:45:19.636]  Now the mayor's office now admits that he quote did talk to you and that you know he was talking to you because there were witnesses and reporters and people around but what's their spin on this?
[00:45:20.477 --> 00:45:38.123]  Well they had to admit that he was out there because there's hundreds of people that walk by in the three or four hours that I was out there so they knew that they couldn't lie about that and so they said yeah he was indeed out there on his own lunch hour which was you know 2.30 in the afternoon and
[00:45:40.905 --> 00:45:46.953]  But, it was, they called it a publicity stunt on the part of our organization, which of course is not true.
[00:45:47.273 --> 00:45:50.858]  Although, we have gotten quite a bit of publicity out of this.
[00:45:51.508 --> 00:45:52.669]  None of it good for the mayor.
[00:45:52.949 --> 00:45:53.890]  Well, Jimmy, I'll tell you.
[00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:57.394]  Do you remember four years ago when I caught the bribery on video at the Capitol?
[00:45:57.734 --> 00:45:58.394]  I do remember.
[00:45:58.695 --> 00:46:08.344]  And we put it on TV, put it on the web, and I was there, and we catch the guy paying the money out right outside the chambers of two people that had just testified, and the House Ethics Board said it was illegal.
[00:46:08.764 --> 00:46:11.507]  But then the paper actually said, it's just for publicity, Mr. Jones.
[00:46:11.547 --> 00:46:12.508]  Why did you videotape this?
[00:46:12.548 --> 00:46:13.749]  I said, because it's bribery.
[00:46:14.009 --> 00:46:16.091]  They said, but the men were black being paid off.
[00:46:16.912 --> 00:46:18.533]  Would you have done this if they would have been black?
[00:46:18.573 --> 00:46:20.314]  I was like, what a red herring!
[00:46:20.334 --> 00:46:21.575]  You know, this is what they do.
[00:46:21.595 --> 00:46:23.797]  You know, it's classic.
[00:46:24.237 --> 00:46:28.761]  On the Fox News piece locally, you said, well, there was a reporter there that saw this.
[00:46:29.121 --> 00:46:31.263]  So they go to another reporter and go, was it you?
[00:46:31.443 --> 00:46:33.785]  And she goes, no, it was another station reporter.
[00:46:34.125 --> 00:46:38.329]  And then, as if that muddies the water, just this confusion.
[00:46:39.129 --> 00:46:42.272]  It's like Popular Mechanics with this 9-11 hit piece that's coming out.
[00:46:43.382 --> 00:46:57.007]  You know, they go, they call me up and they go, Mr. Jones, uh, well, I'll talk about it later, but the point is, they go, Mr. Jones, we called these people that you say you interviewed, uh, about seismographs showing explosions in the towers, and they said, you never interviewed them.
[00:46:57.468 --> 00:47:01.329]  And I went and looked on the web and I said, we posted an American Free Press article.
[00:47:01.389 --> 00:47:03.110]  It says the author in the newspaper.
[00:47:03.570 --> 00:47:05.491]  I post hundreds of things every week on my site.
[00:47:05.551 --> 00:47:05.931]  You know.
[00:47:06.171 --> 00:47:08.772]  I go, did you call and say, were you interviewed by this newspaper?
[00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:10.272]  Uh, no, we didn't do that.
[00:47:10.312 --> 00:47:11.193]  So that's the weird
[00:47:11.853 --> 00:47:12.053]  I am.
[00:47:36.590 --> 00:47:37.170]  Sorry about that.
[00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.130]  No, that's OK.
[00:47:38.871 --> 00:47:46.292]  Now, Linda, how do you think this is going to affect things in the next two weeks before you know you have enough signatures?
[00:47:46.312 --> 00:47:49.953]  You've got to have at least 10,000 more than the actual number because they're going to try to throw out a lot.
[00:47:50.333 --> 00:47:51.454]  What's the process?
[00:47:53.034 --> 00:47:54.574]  How do you think this will affect it?
[00:47:54.614 --> 00:47:59.655]  Because again, I've got other newspaper articles about other people saying that folks have tried to bribe them.
[00:47:59.876 --> 00:48:01.436]  Not this individual, but other people.
[00:48:01.936 --> 00:48:03.496]  And the DA, quote, is investigating.
[00:48:03.516 --> 00:48:06.077]  I don't really have any faith in that, but how do you see this playing out?
[00:48:08.795 --> 00:48:09.395]  Who knows?
[00:48:10.875 --> 00:48:23.358]  Here's the thing, and this goes back to everything that, every kind of decision in this country depends on one thing that I think a lot of people are blocking on.
[00:48:24.958 --> 00:48:29.419]  Whatever gets decided is by virtue of what the people demand or don't demand.
[00:48:29.959 --> 00:48:37.200]  And the reason why we're in this position in the first place is we've got 8% of the people here voting in city elections.
[00:48:38.516 --> 00:48:41.057]  And a real lack of participation.
[00:48:41.097 --> 00:48:42.417]  And that's not to blame people.
[00:48:42.457 --> 00:48:45.118]  I understand they're cynical and they have good reason to be cynical.
[00:48:45.539 --> 00:48:46.099]  But you know what?
[00:48:46.819 --> 00:48:52.401]  We've got to open up, clean up this process and make it work for us or they're going to decide for us.
[00:48:52.781 --> 00:48:54.322]  Well that's the problem with corruption.
[00:48:54.342 --> 00:48:55.882]  It doesn't just stay in one spot.
[00:48:56.122 --> 00:48:57.823]  It either gets better or it gets worse.
[00:48:58.542 --> 00:48:58.782]  Right.
[00:48:59.122 --> 00:49:07.768]  And we're plunging downwards, and we've got these big corporate interests that are just going to have all the cities hand over their roads to them.
[00:49:07.788 --> 00:49:10.030]  That's the thing about this corporate fascism, folks.
[00:49:10.330 --> 00:49:11.311]  It's not free market.
[00:49:12.011 --> 00:49:14.373]  Right, and we were talking about this last night.
[00:49:14.693 --> 00:49:20.857]  The political system, our electoral system, is definitely getting shut down in a host of ways.
[00:49:20.918 --> 00:49:22.419]  I don't need to preach to your audience.
[00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.300]  They probably already understand this pretty well.
[00:49:25.137 --> 00:49:26.477]  So what are we going to do about that?
[00:49:26.537 --> 00:49:28.478]  Are we going to then not participate?
[00:49:28.518 --> 00:49:29.839]  Because you know what?
[00:49:29.959 --> 00:49:31.199]  We still have some openings.
[00:49:31.699 --> 00:49:33.080]  Not big ones, little ones.
[00:49:33.180 --> 00:49:33.840]  But you know what?
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:36.741]  Here in Austin, we took a little bit of opening.
[00:49:36.841 --> 00:49:38.921]  Just a guy, Sal Costello did.
[00:49:39.422 --> 00:49:45.324]  And a bunch of people started following him and now there's a big, big wide opening and everyone needs to rush right in.
[00:49:45.844 --> 00:49:52.046]  And we need to take this fight around the toll roads and remember the long-term war that we're having.
[00:49:52.106 --> 00:49:52.866]  And the war is
[00:49:53.539 --> 00:49:56.400]  Is this political system going to work for the people or against us?
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:50:04.181]  Now, Linda, give people the Austin Toll Party website twice, and give them the phone number twice if people want to come help you.
[00:50:04.461 --> 00:50:07.742]  Yes, it's austintollparty.com.
[00:50:08.502 --> 00:50:10.522]  That's austintollparty.com.
[00:50:10.783 --> 00:50:12.503]  The number is 37512, I'm sorry, area code 512-371-9926.
[00:50:18.376 --> 00:50:21.257]  And that number again?
[00:50:21.277 --> 00:50:21.297]  371-9926.
[00:50:21.718 --> 00:50:28.261]  I hope to see everybody Monday night at the LBJ Auditorium at UT Campus starting at 6 o'clock.
[00:50:28.281 --> 00:50:29.561]  That's 25th and Red River.
[00:50:29.601 --> 00:50:30.962]  Lots of parking is available.
[00:50:31.802 --> 00:50:35.544]  Alright, I want to come back to a few more minutes with you guys and kind of recap things.
[00:50:36.164 --> 00:50:38.205]  But again, this is a national fight.
[00:50:39.646 --> 00:50:44.348]  And billions of dollars for the globalists are riding on this just in Austin alone.
[00:50:45.311 --> 00:50:47.433]  I'll probably move out of the city if they put these tolls in.
[00:50:47.453 --> 00:50:52.158]  I mean, it is going to be a hellish tracking grid of taxation and control.
[00:50:52.178 --> 00:50:54.360]  And it's coming to a town or city near you.
[00:50:54.941 --> 00:50:56.042]  Even the rural areas.
[00:50:56.603 --> 00:50:59.505]  You better educate yourselves now, or the open road's dead.
[00:51:01.323 --> 00:51:05.666]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.846 --> 00:51:10.269]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.409 --> 00:51:14.792]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.832 --> 00:51:16.193]  The New World Order.
[00:51:16.923 --> 00:51:18.345]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.182 --> 00:51:32.882]  We're good to go.
[00:52:00.729 --> 00:52:02.710]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:52:02.790 --> 00:52:13.492]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:52:13.872 --> 00:52:18.393]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:52:18.453 --> 00:52:29.796]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:52:30.396 --> 00:52:37.239]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:52:37.639 --> 00:52:39.780]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:52:40.260 --> 00:52:45.243]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 hose filter elements.
[00:52:45.543 --> 00:52:52.826]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438, and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:52.866 --> 00:52:53.506]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:00.009 --> 00:53:00.509]  Three-Eight.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.320]  I think so.

[00:54:02.477 --> 00:54:07.624]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.305 --> 00:54:10.648]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:11.429 --> 00:54:17.136]  Well, you've probably seen the shows on Bonanza, the old westerns, where, quote, it's a bad town.
[00:54:17.757 --> 00:54:27.059]  They make you pay a toll to get through the pass, and the bad sheriff and the local fat cat feed on the public and steal people's property.
[00:54:27.279 --> 00:54:29.040]  Those are all based on true stories.
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:34.101]  I'm kind of a history buff, especially on Western history in the last 150, 160, 170 years.
[00:54:34.801 --> 00:54:41.643]  And those were all real cases that then got written about and turned into fictional accounts for television.
[00:54:42.453 --> 00:54:43.574]  And basically, that's what happens.
[00:54:43.594 --> 00:54:44.435]  That's what tyranny is.
[00:54:44.515 --> 00:54:51.859]  Government goes bad, corrupt people that want to feed off the public, get into control, and they get arrogant, and they get out of control, and things get bad.
[00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:56.042]  And the toll roads are a nightmare, and it's just all part of the system.
[00:54:56.682 --> 00:54:58.724]  And, you know, Jimmy and
[00:54:59.801 --> 00:55:06.564]  Folks like him are just standing up to the corrupt sheriff, standing up to the corrupt local viceroys, and saying no.
[00:55:06.684 --> 00:55:11.345]  So, Jimmy Gardner, and of course Linda Curtis, I want to commend both of you.
[00:55:11.746 --> 00:55:17.388]  And last time on the TV show, Jimmy, you challenged the mayor's aide.
[00:55:17.908 --> 00:55:20.169]  You said, hey buddy, let's both take a lie detector test.
[00:55:20.189 --> 00:55:21.209]  You want to challenge him again?
[00:55:21.229 --> 00:55:23.350]  Yeah, I'll put it out to you.
[00:55:24.190 --> 00:55:28.512]  Matt Curtis, or Mack Curtis, as you introduced yourself to me.
[00:55:29.053 --> 00:55:34.498]  If you want to take a lie detector and make it public, I'll be glad to do the same thing.
[00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:37.921]  And don't have one of his buddies with a lie detector.
[00:55:37.941 --> 00:55:39.923]  You're going to put 20 names in a hat and pull one out.
[00:55:40.343 --> 00:55:40.543]  Exactly.
[00:55:40.563 --> 00:55:43.906]  Let's both have you sit there on video camera and do it.
[00:55:44.627 --> 00:55:45.168]  Exactly.
[00:55:45.208 --> 00:55:47.590]  Let's not let them corrupt that process either.
[00:55:49.127 --> 00:56:00.255]  Well, I think this is going to hurt them bad, but the whole process from the state to the federal and local level is just riddled with stuff that mirrors this.
[00:56:00.375 --> 00:56:06.640]  And, Jimmy, I want to thank you for coming on, and we'll have you guys back on for a plug on Monday if we're able to.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:08.721]  Linda, final comments?
[00:56:09.322 --> 00:56:12.544]  Just that this is part of a long-term effort.
[00:56:12.584 --> 00:56:17.408]  We all need to understand this is just one battle in the long-term war against
[00:56:19.181 --> 00:56:26.571]  The corruption of our very system itself and the people need to get involved and take back the system, make it work for us.
[00:56:26.651 --> 00:56:28.634]  Those who make the rules, rule.
[00:56:29.249 --> 00:56:31.191]  And the people need to rule, not the politicians.
[00:56:31.291 --> 00:56:34.513]  And they know we haven't been paying attention, so they're going wild right now.
[00:56:35.194 --> 00:56:36.335]  Give them that website again.
[00:56:36.355 --> 00:56:38.477]  AustinTollParty.com.
[00:56:38.577 --> 00:56:39.838]  And the phone number, 512-371-9926.
[00:56:39.918 --> 00:56:46.383]  Hope to see you all Monday night, 6 o'clock at the LBJ Auditorium.
[00:56:46.423 --> 00:56:48.345]  Let's pack the hall with a thousand people.
[00:56:48.565 --> 00:56:49.406]  Alright, take care.
[00:56:49.966 --> 00:56:50.587]  Thanks a lot.
[00:56:50.827 --> 00:56:51.147]  You bet.
[00:56:51.167 --> 00:56:52.008]  God bless you both.
[00:56:52.428 --> 00:56:56.111]  You know, Jimmy's doing a lot sticking his neck out here, going public up against these people.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:57:01.263]  All of us need to stand with him and not let him get away with this.
[00:57:01.343 --> 00:57:02.124]  We're very close.
[00:57:02.585 --> 00:57:04.227]  So go get some of the petitions off the website.
[00:57:04.247 --> 00:57:11.074]  Go get them signed and show up Monday and get them notarized there at the LBJ Presidential Library and Museum.
[00:57:11.713 --> 00:57:39.362]  Before I end this hour, if you believe in this broadcast, believe in what we're doing, you want to support us, plus get great videos that are professionally produced and expose the New World Order, the police state, 9-11, the occult activities of the world leaders, get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, get 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, get The Masters of Terror, get 9-11 The Great Illusion, the 9-11 Painful Deceptions, the books, the videos, go to InfoWars.com, peruse the Safe, Secure Online Shopping Cart, read free chapters of the books,

[00:58:40.662 --> 00:58:45.686]  Second hour, a ton of news, a great guest, your calls, it's all coming up!
[00:58:46.246 --> 00:58:49.049]  So keep it locked in, we'll be right back!
[00:58:49.469 --> 00:58:49.990]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.361 --> 00:59:00.422]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.122 --> 00:59:02.223]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.884 --> 00:59:03.705]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.465 --> 00:59:05.386]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.026 --> 00:59:09.869]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.210 --> 00:59:14.333]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:19.757 --> 00:59:25.201]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, into the second hour, talking about the national toll roads going in.
[00:59:26.428 --> 00:59:31.609]  Tracker chipped and taxed and watched to the tune of thousands of dollars a year.
[00:59:31.629 --> 00:59:38.531]  And all of the allegations from just many different quarters of bribery and fraud going on by the state and locals involved.
[00:59:39.751 --> 00:59:42.052]  Amazing interviews in the last hour.
[00:59:43.472 --> 00:59:46.333]  We've got a guest coming up to talk about, well, impending World War III.
[00:59:47.654 --> 00:59:51.336]  How the good old globalists want to go into Iran and what that could trigger.
[00:59:51.736 --> 00:59:57.219]  Another inside expert to give us analysis and we'll take your phone calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:57.799 --> 01:00:00.201]  And then in the third hour, oppose H.R.
[01:00:00.501 --> 01:00:06.264]  418, an addendum, an expansion of national ID card legislation passed in mid-December of 2004.
[01:00:06.364 --> 01:00:07.585]  Scheduled to pass today.
[01:00:12.811 --> 01:00:13.031]  HR 418.
[01:00:13.772 --> 01:00:16.254]  This is Ron Paul's analysis of it.
[01:00:16.714 --> 01:00:23.499]  Establish a federally coordinated database of personal information on American citizens within Canada and Mexico.
[01:00:23.679 --> 01:00:27.362]  Use the national ID card to track American citizens when traveling outside the U.S.
[01:00:27.422 --> 01:00:28.422]  and within the U.S.
[01:00:29.003 --> 01:00:38.790]  Redefine terrorism in broad new terms that could include members of firearms rights and anti-abortion groups or other such groups as determined by whoever it is.
[01:00:39.742 --> 01:00:40.883]  In power at the time.
[01:00:41.244 --> 01:00:53.475]  Five, authorize the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to unilaterally expand the information included in the driver's license, including such biometric information as retina scans and DNA information, forced DNA testing, when you get your driver's license.
[01:00:54.091 --> 01:00:58.676]  And even radio frequency identification tracker chips in your driver's license.
[01:00:59.196 --> 01:01:05.643]  Ron Paul went on to state that this does nothing to stop illegal aliens, but it's being sold to the public as that when it's a fraud.
[01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:11.229]  And he went on to say carrying a driver's license with RFID and government officials will know your whereabouts 24-7.
[01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:14.815]  And he goes on, incredibly, H.R.
[01:01:15.295 --> 01:01:20.277]  418 does nothing to solve the growing threat to national security posed by people who are already in the U.S.
[01:01:20.297 --> 01:01:20.758]  illegally.
[01:01:20.818 --> 01:01:21.858]  Instead, H.R.
[01:01:22.038 --> 01:01:28.841]  418 states that we already know certain people here are illegal and are deportable, but it does nothing to mandate deportation.
[01:01:30.122 --> 01:01:36.225]  It's like they pass money for more Border Patrol, and Ridge says, we're not going to fund that, we're taking that money for something else.
[01:01:37.485 --> 01:01:40.607]  So... They're slick, folks!
[01:01:42.751 --> 01:01:56.601]  But defending the Republic is a lot of fun and learning their scams is very enlightening and it's very empowering so I challenge you to get involved and wake up to what's happening and call Congress and say no to H.R.
[01:01:56.621 --> 01:02:02.325]  418 that they're going to be voting on as early as this afternoon or tomorrow.
[01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:09.811]  Now there's a bunch of other news that I want to cover that's just really, really important.
[01:02:10.899 --> 01:02:15.302]  And one of the stories is just the ongoing mass conditioning to accept torture and evil.
[01:02:15.322 --> 01:02:17.144]  You know, I've interviewed him.
[01:02:17.184 --> 01:02:25.070]  I don't think he's a bad guy, but Ted Nugent had that, uh, Ted Nugent's extreme survival, survivor, and they had people down in
[01:02:26.047 --> 01:02:43.533]  These pits, and of course it had rained, so there was three feet of water, and it was 50 degree water, so they were getting hypothermia, and I talked to folks that were on set, they were, the producers, when the medics were saying, get them out, they were saying, oh no, no, no, wait till we get the shots, people are passing out from being in, you know, freezing water for hours, very cold water for hours.
[01:02:43.553 --> 01:02:48.415]  Yeah, but that's, with scorpions all over them, by the way, but that's nothing, folks,
[01:02:50.203 --> 01:02:50.824]  Listen to this.
[01:02:51.324 --> 01:02:52.264]  It's dehumanization.
[01:02:52.564 --> 01:02:57.306]  The UK lines up Guantonimo-style torture reality TV show.
[01:02:57.846 --> 01:03:08.790]  Channel 4 is to broadcast what is styling as Guantonimo-based style reality show that will examine the effects of mild torture on seven male volunteers, Muslims.
[01:03:09.070 --> 01:03:09.130]  No.
[01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:12.173]  Torturing Muslims on TV is all part of the fun.
[01:03:12.533 --> 01:03:16.057]  The Guantanamo guidebook will recreate some of the practices used at U.S.
[01:03:16.097 --> 01:03:21.502]  naval bases where hundreds of so-called enemy combatants have been held without trial or access to lawyers for nearly three years.
[01:03:23.003 --> 01:03:28.229]  And using an East London warehouse and declassified internal documents obtained from U.S.
[01:03:28.249 --> 01:03:28.569]  sources,
[01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:38.913]  Program makers mocked up conditions as they had them in Saigon, Panama Bay, before subjecting seven volunteers to some of the milder forms of torture alleged to have been used by U.S.
[01:03:38.953 --> 01:03:39.374]  authorities.
[01:03:40.874 --> 01:03:47.237]  And they have a TV show called Spooks on British TV, where they kill or they torture people's children to get answers.
[01:03:47.757 --> 01:03:51.299]  All simulated evil, condition you to accept it, we'll be back.
[01:03:53.553 --> 01:03:55.073]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.253 --> 01:03:58.334]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.454 --> 01:04:02.355]  One look in the mirror, and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.415 --> 01:04:06.636]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.996 --> 01:04:10.777]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.837 --> 01:04:12.778]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.798 --> 01:04:16.219]  The police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:04:16.259 --> 01:04:17.359]  The medical bills!
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:20.962]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.122 --> 01:04:24.165]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.345 --> 01:04:27.207]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.688 --> 01:04:33.813]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.353 --> 01:04:38.134]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:07:05.375 --> 01:07:09.717]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.217 --> 01:07:14.360]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:16.161 --> 01:07:20.183]  Alright, eight minutes, twenty-five seconds into the second hour.
[01:07:20.223 --> 01:07:21.924]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:07:23.439 --> 01:07:28.801]  Last hour we talked about the national toll roads going in that will tax and trace everything you do.
[01:07:29.442 --> 01:07:34.864]  Here in Texas it'll be $1800 plus a year per car per driver.
[01:07:35.044 --> 01:07:35.925]  Hope you enjoy it.
[01:07:36.825 --> 01:07:40.927]  But now we're shifting from the toll roads into the police state.
[01:07:41.505 --> 01:07:46.306]  You know, why does the empire that wants to project itself outwards want so much control here domestically?
[01:07:46.626 --> 01:07:57.008]  Well, that's so we can't struggle as we're used as the cannon fodder both to be taxed to fund these wars and to, of course, the draft that's coming up, that'll be the good little slaves for these wars.
[01:07:57.948 --> 01:08:05.109]  And we've been having a lot of insiders, a lot of admirals, judge-advocate generals, you know, the father of Reaganomics.
[01:08:05.129 --> 01:08:08.770]  We've been having congressmen, senators, mainly conservatives,
[01:08:09.802 --> 01:08:15.586]  on this broadcast to expose the neocons and expose the agenda that could lead us into World War 3.
[01:08:16.086 --> 01:08:17.548]  Woolsey calls it World War 4.
[01:08:17.588 --> 01:08:19.269]  He thinks Cold War was World War 3.
[01:08:21.050 --> 01:08:28.415]  It's a powder keg with Iran and we're just inches away from Israel attacking them and then things just going downhill from there.
[01:08:28.455 --> 01:08:35.440]  To talk about the geopolitical stratagem behind this and to predict where things are going
[01:08:36.235 --> 01:08:57.183]  He's the author of American Oil Wars, Steve Pelletier, and he's retired after a long and rich career with the CIA and then the Army War College, and he's a PhD in political science and after a stint in journalism covering the Middle East, he became the CIA's senior analyst at
[01:08:57.802 --> 01:08:58.703]  Thank you very much.
[01:09:26.883 --> 01:09:42.008]  Kind of give us a sketch, you know, for the novice out there of why you think these preemptive wars are being engaged in and what's the prime mover behind that.
[01:09:42.969 --> 01:09:44.749]  Well, first off, tell us a little bit about yourself.
[01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:48.050]  Well, you gave a rundown already.
[01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:51.912]  I started my... I was originally a journalist and then
[01:09:53.294 --> 01:09:55.215]  I got a Ph.D.
[01:09:55.255 --> 01:10:21.808]  in Political Science at Berkeley and then taught at one of the colleges for a while and then the CIA recruited me to be their Kurdish expert and then I just segued from that into being a Senior Political Analyst on Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War and then I left at the end of the war and went to the U.S.
[01:10:21.868 --> 01:10:22.849]  Army War College
[01:10:23.959 --> 01:10:25.901]  Well, frankly, I was doing the same thing.
[01:10:25.921 --> 01:10:29.904]  I was the Pentagon's Iraq expert.
[01:10:30.464 --> 01:10:32.946]  And I kept up that for 12 years.
[01:10:33.006 --> 01:10:35.748]  I've written four books, published four books on Iraq.
[01:10:36.889 --> 01:10:39.731]  And I know Iraq very well.
[01:10:39.751 --> 01:10:45.475]  Is there a website you want to give out?
[01:10:45.555 --> 01:10:48.477]  I would rather just put a plug for the book.
[01:10:48.518 --> 01:10:50.299]  That is America's Oil Wars.
[01:10:50.339 --> 01:10:51.640]  It was published by Prager.
[01:10:52.290 --> 01:10:54.031]  P-R-A-E-G-E-R
[01:11:09.153 --> 01:11:10.054]  No, I'm not.
[01:11:27.651 --> 01:11:35.021]  Well, he's prancing around talking about basically invading the whole planet and saying we work for global corporations and the military is their tool.
[01:11:35.662 --> 01:11:39.427]  I'm sure you're familiar with that whole school of thought right now that's coming out of the Pentagon.
[01:11:39.447 --> 01:11:40.428]  War, war, war.
[01:11:45.896 --> 01:11:50.837]  I mean, clearly our government helped put Saddam in, trained him in the fifties even before he got into power in 79.
[01:11:51.617 --> 01:11:56.618]  But let's just start with the Iran-Iraq war and the nerve gas.
[01:11:56.798 --> 01:11:58.078]  That's probably a good place to start.
[01:11:58.498 --> 01:11:59.498]  Alright.
[01:12:00.559 --> 01:12:03.759]  First of all, we did not put Saddam Hussein in.
[01:12:03.779 --> 01:12:05.039]  We can talk about that later.
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:09.680]  They didn't support his ascension to power?
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.060]  There are stories that
[01:12:14.668 --> 01:12:19.849]  Of connections, contacts between Saddam and the United States.
[01:12:20.449 --> 01:12:28.832]  But they're pretty... Our government didn't fund him billions and billions of dollars for the war with Iran?
[01:12:29.132 --> 01:12:30.972]  No, I don't think we did.
[01:12:31.592 --> 01:12:40.094]  We helped him early on in the war because we did not want to see the Islamic Republic win that war.
[01:12:40.694 --> 01:12:42.815]  But then in the middle of the war we switched.
[01:12:43.782 --> 01:12:50.047]  You remember Iran-Contra, and then we supported Iran against Iraq.
[01:12:50.447 --> 01:12:54.830]  Well certainly you know in 1954 he was sent to Egypt and trained as an assassin.
[01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:56.291]  Oh no, no, no, come on.
[01:12:57.011 --> 01:13:03.716]  He went to Egypt, he fled Iraq, and he lived in Egypt for a while.
[01:13:03.736 --> 01:13:11.942]  And as I understand it, I think he either beat up very badly a fellow Iraqi or else
[01:13:13.119 --> 01:13:14.740]  I don't think he actually killed a fellow.
[01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.940]  That's funny.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:21.843]  Even the Associated Press has reported his CIA training and that he went around... Oh, that's nonsense.
[01:13:22.063 --> 01:13:24.684]  I can't believe the Associated Press would print that.
[01:13:25.465 --> 01:13:25.905]  Oh, really?
[01:13:25.925 --> 01:13:28.746]  Wow, I'm going to have to dig that stuff up and have you back on.
[01:13:28.826 --> 01:13:29.606]  Yeah, you do that.
[01:13:31.562 --> 01:13:35.043]  All right, well, you see, you will come back on when I get that... Oh, sure.
[01:13:35.103 --> 01:13:39.044]  All right, well, perhaps I'll get some other of your colleagues on to talk about it.
[01:13:39.664 --> 01:13:42.245]  But, so, I mean, give us your world view, then.
[01:13:42.285 --> 01:13:45.466]  What do you think about... We were getting into the nerve gas.
[01:13:46.506 --> 01:13:47.707]  It's gas.
[01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:49.387]  It's not nerve gas.
[01:13:49.447 --> 01:13:50.067]  It's gas.
[01:13:50.267 --> 01:13:55.449]  And the cream is made, and I'm sure... What type of gas is it, then?
[01:13:57.518 --> 01:14:04.284]  The gas that was used at Halepsia, that's what we're going to talk about now, was cyanide gas.
[01:14:05.305 --> 01:14:06.827]  That doesn't kill you through your nerves?
[01:14:06.947 --> 01:14:07.747]  It doesn't matter?
[01:14:07.867 --> 01:14:14.914]  Well, there are so many of these gases out there that you don't want to get confused.
[01:14:15.274 --> 01:14:19.298]  There are claims that two gases were used at Halepsia.
[01:14:19.358 --> 01:14:22.581]  One was mustard gas and the other was cyanide gas.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:30.082]  Uh, and of course, uh... Mustard attacks the respiratory, but I mean, clearly, isn't cyanide gas classified as a nerve gas?
[01:14:30.322 --> 01:14:31.742]  I think you may be correct, Gary.
[01:14:31.782 --> 01:14:33.083]  Oh, okay, okay.
[01:14:33.323 --> 01:14:35.863]  Sorry for using the word nerve gas, but that's what I understand it to be.
[01:14:35.883 --> 01:14:42.405]  I mean, certainly sarin would be more of a classical nerve gas, but I think it's... I mean, just please give us your view on that.
[01:14:42.825 --> 01:14:52.728]  Well, as you know, the claim of the Bush administration is that Saddam Hussein gassed his own people.
[01:14:54.504 --> 01:15:07.730]  There's complications with that, because the only authenticated instance where Iraqis died, having been gassed, is this incident in Aleppo.
[01:15:08.531 --> 01:15:14.693]  And immediately after that occurred, and this was in 1988, the U.S.
[01:15:14.753 --> 01:15:18.075]  government investigated and the U.S.
[01:15:18.115 --> 01:15:19.936]  government determined that
[01:15:21.161 --> 01:15:33.568]  Given the condition of the bodies of the dead Iraqis, it's likely that they were killed with a cyanide gas, and Iraq didn't use that gas, and as far as anyone knew, didn't have that gas.
[01:15:34.329 --> 01:15:38.691]  I'm sorry to have to mention this, Steve, but can you get closer to your cordless phone, Jack?
[01:15:38.851 --> 01:15:40.892]  Yeah, alright.
[01:15:41.113 --> 01:15:41.973]  It's just cutting out.
[01:15:41.993 --> 01:15:44.374]  I want people to be able to hear you.
[01:15:44.414 --> 01:15:48.637]  Yeah, the claim is that the Iraqis used a
[01:15:51.733 --> 01:15:52.174]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:01.097 --> 01:16:01.637]  The U.S.
[01:16:01.797 --> 01:16:10.560]  Army investigated that claim, and they said that the gas that killed the Kurds, the Iraqis didn't have.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:15.362]  The Iranians did have it, so therefore they said the Iranians killed the Kurds.
[01:16:15.542 --> 01:16:18.082]  And that was an Army War College report, correct?
[01:16:18.103 --> 01:16:23.404]  No, it was a report of the Defense Intelligence Agency, which is based in the Pentagon.
[01:16:23.825 --> 01:16:27.866]  Okay, because again, I have the news report here, and it was saying Army War College report.
[01:16:28.869 --> 01:16:31.951]  Okay, so I guess that's wrong then, it wasn't an Army War College report?
[01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:37.275]  Well, the Army, to straighten that out, the D.I.A.
[01:16:37.415 --> 01:16:41.438]  conducted the study, and then... Then it was published to the Army War College?
[01:16:41.518 --> 01:16:41.899]  Excuse me?
[01:16:42.299 --> 01:16:43.760]  It was published to the Army War College?
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:56.950]  No, no, after the study was conducted, the Army asked me to head up a study that would investigate how the Iraqis
[01:16:58.026 --> 01:17:00.688]  would fight a war against the United States.
[01:17:00.708 --> 01:17:03.671]  So I'm looking at the sub-findings out of that report and your report.
[01:17:04.011 --> 01:17:06.553]  Yeah, so you're confusing the two reports.
[01:17:07.053 --> 01:17:11.797]  All I did was in my report I publicized the DIA report.
[01:17:11.997 --> 01:17:18.042]  So supposedly they looked at the gas and found it was cyanide gas that the Iranian Jews, which the Iraqis didn't use.
[01:17:18.462 --> 01:17:18.682]  Right.
[01:17:19.563 --> 01:17:24.727]  Okay, now Ray McGovern said on the show two years ago that that's what he thought and then later he reversed himself.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:28.440]  Hello?
[01:17:29.601 --> 01:17:32.183]  It seems that there are some questions on this subject.
[01:17:32.463 --> 01:17:32.703]  Yeah.
[01:17:34.524 --> 01:17:35.865]  So, is it definitive?
[01:17:37.646 --> 01:17:39.067]  Well, look at it this way.
[01:17:40.728 --> 01:17:45.371]  All of these events took place in the end of the 1980s.
[01:17:45.391 --> 01:17:48.933]  They took place during a war.
[01:17:48.953 --> 01:17:56.218]  The Iraqis and the Iranians refused to allow newsmen to go to the front.
[01:17:57.330 --> 01:18:05.975]  As a consequence, when these events occurred, there was no one who could report on them first-hand.
[01:18:06.516 --> 01:18:10.778]  So whatever information we get, we get second-hand.
[01:18:11.959 --> 01:18:17.222]  And in answer to your question, no, there's nothing definitive on any of this.
[01:18:17.262 --> 01:18:19.823]  Because there's the fog of war and the glass of broccoli.
[01:18:20.064 --> 01:18:24.006]  But in this case, the fog of war was really intense, because
[01:18:25.414 --> 01:18:30.097]  These were two closed societies and they didn't allow anyone in.
[01:18:30.297 --> 01:18:34.719]  So any information that got out was pretty tenuous.
[01:18:34.779 --> 01:18:36.539]  All right, stay there.
[01:18:36.559 --> 01:18:52.006]  I want to shift gears when we get back and talk about what you think the real strategic plans are and what you see happening, how you think Iran's going to play into all this when we get back.
[01:18:52.026 --> 01:18:52.467]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.341 --> 01:18:55.842]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[01:18:56.302 --> 01:19:00.604]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:19:01.004 --> 01:19:01.884]  It still is!
[01:19:02.504 --> 01:19:05.986]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:19:06.326 --> 01:19:08.127]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:19:08.667 --> 01:19:10.728]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:19:11.306 --> 01:19:13.328]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:19:13.688 --> 01:19:21.374]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:19:21.755 --> 01:19:25.518]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[01:20:40.258 --> 01:20:40.819]  1-800-419-W.
[01:20:53.817 --> 01:20:57.100]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:01.344]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:21:01.584 --> 01:21:04.366]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:21:04.566 --> 01:21:06.968]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:15.796]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:21:15.996 --> 01:21:17.337]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:21:17.537 --> 01:21:21.681]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:21:21.941 --> 01:21:22.642]  We're good to go.
[01:21:51.743 --> 01:21:52.318]  I don't either.
[01:21:54.244 --> 01:22:00.508]  Hi, this is Tasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the pets back in your step.
[01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:05.691]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[01:22:05.911 --> 01:22:19.159]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[01:22:19.419 --> 01:22:22.661]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[01:22:22.921 --> 01:22:25.282]  Introducing the incredible Life Wave Patch.
[01:22:25.462 --> 01:22:29.305]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[01:22:29.505 --> 01:22:32.586]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and little league alike.
[01:22:32.807 --> 01:22:36.309]  The Life Wave Patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[01:22:36.589 --> 01:22:40.671]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition, or just trying to beat the clock.
[01:22:40.971 --> 01:22:43.192]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[01:22:43.393 --> 01:22:46.734]  Go to www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[01:22:46.995 --> 01:22:50.477]  Again, that's www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[01:22:57.250 --> 01:23:06.414]  We're talking to Steve Peltier, CIA Senior Analyst at Lanley during the Iran-Iraq War.
[01:23:08.734 --> 01:23:13.316]  Sir, what do you see happening in the future with Iran and others?
[01:23:13.456 --> 01:23:21.739]  Because we've been having a lot of your contemporaries on the broadcast and they're saying that if Israel goes in and bombs their
[01:23:22.668 --> 01:23:51.131]  nuclear reactor sites uh... that uh... that could trigger iran probably will trigger iran going into iraq and then uh... it's gonna be like custards last stand uh... do you think uh... there's any uh... merit to that no i don't i think that uh... the uh... israelis could bomb uh... the site uh... but i don't think the uh... iranians would do any more than the iraqis did when the israelis
[01:23:51.761 --> 01:23:52.922]  Bomb the site.
[01:23:53.002 --> 01:23:55.963]  They would effectively absorb it.
[01:23:56.523 --> 01:24:00.765]  The problem is not with raids from the air.
[01:24:01.785 --> 01:24:07.228]  The problem is going in and occupying territory on the ground, and the United States can't do that anymore.
[01:24:07.828 --> 01:24:16.411]  We can't attack into Iran and occupy territory because we haven't got the manpower.
[01:24:18.263 --> 01:24:23.907]  The Israelis can bomb all they want, but I'm sure the Iranians will absorb it.
[01:24:24.227 --> 01:24:31.913]  Really, a lot of other analysts have been saying that the Iranians have been saying they're going to go absolutely ape.
[01:24:32.693 --> 01:24:36.056]  But you think they'll respond just like the Iraqis did in 1981?
[01:24:36.476 --> 01:24:40.959]  I think that essentially the Iranians have time on their hands.
[01:24:40.979 --> 01:24:43.881]  I mean, they have got
[01:24:46.618 --> 01:24:52.943]  They hold, in my view, they hold a very strong card, and that is that no one can invade that country.
[01:24:53.944 --> 01:25:05.353]  Before we invaded Iraq, the United States was able to pose as invincible, because everyone feared what would happen if the United States were to invade.
[01:25:05.393 --> 01:25:08.195]  Well, we invaded Iraq, and now we're losing the war.
[01:25:09.055 --> 01:25:10.176]  So how can we then
[01:25:11.993 --> 01:25:20.299]  I don't think the Iranians will spill into Iraq, because I think as a result of this last election, the Iranians have Iraq sewed up.
[01:25:20.319 --> 01:25:21.319]  The Shia in Iraq.
[01:25:36.657 --> 01:25:42.183]  I think that the problem is that we don't control the country and we're losing control every day.
[01:25:55.945 --> 01:26:00.451]  So what do you see happening in Iraq from your decades of studying the system there?
[01:26:00.712 --> 01:26:02.574]  Well, I think we're in deep trouble in Iraq.
[01:26:03.275 --> 01:26:04.057]  What's the time frame?
[01:26:04.077 --> 01:26:04.858]  What do you see happening?
[01:26:04.878 --> 01:26:05.899]  Crystal ball it for us.
[01:26:09.122 --> 01:26:14.504]  Um, day-to-day to the end of the year, I see just a progressive loss of control.
[01:26:14.844 --> 01:26:27.668]  The only way we can get control in Iraq is by sending over many more troops, and we can't do that without reinstituting... Do you agree with Secretary White two and a half years ago when he said 400,000 troops minimum?
[01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:34.931]  I think it's, uh, I would, you know, I think Shinseki said 300,000, so yeah, that's about right.
[01:26:36.300 --> 01:26:39.041]  But now stuff's deteriorated so bad, it's like Vietnam.
[01:26:39.061 --> 01:26:43.243]  I think you could keep... a lot of analysts say you keep injecting more troops, it's not going to help.
[01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:48.725]  Well, I think that if we were willing to inject enough troops, it would help.
[01:26:48.785 --> 01:26:55.087]  Because I think the Iraqis are so desperate for some stability now, that once they perceive
[01:26:55.700 --> 01:26:58.962]  That, in fact, the United States was re-stabilizing the country.
[01:26:59.022 --> 01:27:02.464]  I think they would swing over because... Well, that's what all the Pentagon analysts said.
[01:27:02.484 --> 01:27:07.328]  If we could get the power on and the water on in a few weeks, we would have won it, but not now.
[01:27:07.688 --> 01:27:15.513]  But, as you suggest, we missed a lot of good opportunities, and now it's very difficult to see how we catch up.
[01:27:18.255 --> 01:27:21.277]  You know, they talk about freedom, bringing freedom to Iraq, but...
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:30.685]  The reports are most of the baths have been put back into control, they've had a lot of draconian things, arresting thousands of people at checkpoints because their papers aren't in order.
[01:27:31.325 --> 01:27:35.948]  It seems to me that this policy has made enemies faster than they can be killed.
[01:27:36.728 --> 01:27:43.532]  Well, there's no question that we're making enemies, but I think one of the main reasons we're making enemies is because we don't have enough troops.
[01:27:44.085 --> 01:27:49.690]  And as a consequence, we're relying on air power to try to control the country.
[01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:56.756]  We bombed the living daylights out of Fallujah, we killed a lot of civilians, and that sort of thing doesn't make friends.
[01:27:58.237 --> 01:28:01.680]  So, what do you think the Bush administration is going to do?
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.121]  They've been sending out mixed signals.
[01:28:04.162 --> 01:28:11.028]  Really, the Bush administration, in my view, is so deceitful that it's impossible to
[01:28:11.775 --> 01:28:16.637]  To figure out what they're going to do because you can't trust anything they tell us.
[01:28:20.078 --> 01:28:22.239]  That you, yeah, can't trust anything they tell us.
[01:28:22.259 --> 01:28:29.462]  When we get back then I want to try to see where you think all this is going or if you have an idea for an exit strategy or what you think is going to happen.
[01:28:30.536 --> 01:28:32.298]  We'll be back with our guest.
[01:28:32.358 --> 01:28:33.740]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.562]  The website's infowarriors.com.
[01:28:36.142 --> 01:28:39.906]  Prisonplanet.com, because this planet has been turned into a giant prison.
[01:28:39.966 --> 01:28:41.768]  Hence, prisonplanet.com.
[01:28:44.091 --> 01:28:44.992]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.492 --> 01:28:47.094]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.015 --> 01:28:50.698]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.135 --> 01:29:01.620]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.041 --> 01:29:06.285]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:29:06.525 --> 01:29:13.552]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.932 --> 01:29:20.038]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.178 --> 01:29:21.399]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.719 --> 01:29:24.683]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:24.824 --> 01:29:26.886]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:27.167 --> 01:29:34.397]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:34.697 --> 01:29:38.142]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:29:38.502 --> 01:29:46.789]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[01:29:52.193 --> 01:29:52.813]  Call today.
[01:29:54.194 --> 01:29:56.696]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:57.357 --> 01:30:04.002]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:30:05.183 --> 01:30:07.445]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:30:08.263 --> 01:30:14.509]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[01:30:15.389 --> 01:30:23.516]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[01:30:24.537 --> 01:30:32.404]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:30:33.225 --> 01:30:34.746]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800
[01:30:36.596 --> 01:30:36.756]  516-8736.
[01:30:36.796 --> 01:30:37.097]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:30:37.137 --> 01:30:37.417]  Call now.
[01:30:37.457 --> 01:30:39.659]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:57.492]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:30:57.712 --> 01:31:03.155]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:31:03.435 --> 01:31:13.800]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:18.302]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:31:18.482 --> 01:31:19.283]  We're good to go!
[01:31:33.596 --> 01:31:38.082]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:31:38.282 --> 01:31:42.507]  Normally $48 each, get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.
[01:31:42.767 --> 01:31:47.333]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:31:47.353 --> 01:31:47.793]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:32:00.783 --> 01:32:03.145]  All right, 33 minutes past the hour.
[01:32:03.165 --> 01:32:06.787]  We're going to take a few calls coming up here in a few minutes for our guest.
[01:32:08.508 --> 01:32:10.670]  The total free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:11.830]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:11.850 --> 01:32:14.672]  And we're talking to Professor, as you can call him, Dr. Pelletier.
[01:32:14.692 --> 01:32:14.932]  And Steve,
[01:32:29.329 --> 01:32:34.974]  Again, you were the Chief Analyst during the Iran-Iraq War for the CIA.
[01:32:37.256 --> 01:32:48.907]  Knowing what you know about Iraq, and what we were just talking about with the deception of the Bush Administration, I mean, they said before they got into office, oh, we're not going to invade Iraq, we're not for foreign adventures, and he chastised
[01:32:51.106 --> 01:32:54.809]  Al Gore during debates about it, and it turns out we got their own documents.
[01:32:55.269 --> 01:33:00.753]  They were planning before they even got into office to invade Iraq, and 9-11 was the pretext for that.
[01:33:00.813 --> 01:33:16.883]  So, trying to gauge, I know they say something different every day, but trying to gauge their actions, what do you guess, you know, educated guess, is going to happen in Iraq in, let's say, the next 18 months?
[01:33:18.806 --> 01:33:30.235]  I would say that it's definite that the Bush Administration will not send the number of troops over there that we need to have over there to pacify the country.
[01:33:31.476 --> 01:33:44.666]  I would say that if any of your listeners have loved ones in the National Guard or the Reserve that they should feel very sorry for them because these poor devils are not going to get out of there.
[01:33:45.606 --> 01:33:47.468]  They've already had their
[01:33:48.478 --> 01:33:54.161]  Tourists extended and it would not surprise me if the Pentagon extended them again.
[01:33:54.181 --> 01:33:58.343]  Well, they've extended them indefinitely, they announced a month ago.
[01:33:58.563 --> 01:34:02.724]  Well, I think they're practically, these people now are practically indentured slaves.
[01:34:03.485 --> 01:34:06.706]  It's just, as everyone knows, it's a backdoor draft.
[01:34:08.087 --> 01:34:16.591]  But the point is that we know what is needed to salvage that situation in Iraq.
[01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:17.311]  It's more troops.
[01:34:18.276 --> 01:34:19.556]  Rumsfeld will not do it.
[01:34:19.716 --> 01:34:20.757]  Bush will not do it.
[01:34:21.537 --> 01:34:22.657]  Cheney will not do it.
[01:34:23.237 --> 01:34:29.158]  And the reason they won't do it is because it would cost them too much money.
[01:34:30.458 --> 01:34:33.299]  Also, they don't want to admit they're wrong.
[01:34:33.319 --> 01:34:35.039]  That's right, they don't.
[01:34:35.299 --> 01:34:41.440]  They went in there with a silver bullet strategy, which was that you could subdue any people.
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:44.101]  Yeah, the Rumsfeld-Blitzkrieg example.
[01:34:44.141 --> 01:34:45.121]  Right, exactly.
[01:34:45.581 --> 01:34:46.561]  And it hasn't worked.
[01:34:47.311 --> 01:34:58.617]  Uh, and now, if Rumsfeld were to, uh, agree to increase the army by 30,000 troops, it would be a mission that hasn't worked, and he's not going to do that.
[01:34:59.117 --> 01:35:00.998]  Yeah, but 30,000 is going to do nothing.
[01:35:01.478 --> 01:35:02.058]  Yeah, but 30,000...
[01:35:04.453 --> 01:35:06.014]  Is what we need at the moment.
[01:35:06.915 --> 01:35:09.457]  That's not saying what we'll need by the end of the year.
[01:35:09.517 --> 01:35:16.444]  By the way, I mean all the military studies I've read, because I've looked at it quite a bit, I mean they knew this in World War II.
[01:35:16.464 --> 01:35:20.348]  22 missions, catch 22, and still about a third of the time you died.
[01:35:21.368 --> 01:35:29.631]  Vietnam, no more than 11 months, that's all you can force somebody to be in combat, and even then you can fight them maybe one week out of the month, or they break down.
[01:35:30.011 --> 01:35:43.897]  We're talking about sending troops, National Guard who weren't even trained, on search and destroy missions through heavily built up urban mount territory, five days out of the week, raiding dozens of homes a day.
[01:35:43.957 --> 01:35:47.838]  It's worse than that, because who are they fighting?
[01:35:48.413 --> 01:35:52.856]  The Iraqis went to war with the Iranians in 1980, and they've been fighting ever since.
[01:35:53.657 --> 01:36:04.665]  So we're sending, as you say, high school students over there to fight hardened killers, people who have never known anything but war.
[01:36:05.545 --> 01:36:10.429]  And worse, it's not a... You know, the strength of the U.S.
[01:36:10.589 --> 01:36:14.752]  Army and the military is the ability to stand off and kill from a distance.
[01:36:15.310 --> 01:36:16.791]  What's our situation now?
[01:36:17.191 --> 01:36:24.656]  These high school kids have got to go into these cities, down these twisty streets, not knowing what's around the next corner.
[01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:34.843]  But sir, sir, I mean, they know, I mean, I, the published, you know, the military has studied how much you can use a soldier, and this is off the charts.
[01:36:34.923 --> 01:36:41.968]  They know that this is going to ruin these people, and they know within just another six months, they're going to, almost all of them are going to fall apart.
[01:36:42.648 --> 01:36:47.914]  Well, I would suspect that that's true, but go talk to the Bush administration.
[01:36:48.294 --> 01:36:49.035]  Here's an analogy.
[01:36:49.055 --> 01:36:51.157]  We've got SWAT team people listening all over the country.
[01:36:51.497 --> 01:36:56.883]  Guys, imagine having to raid 15, 20 houses a day, five days a week, for two years.
[01:36:57.103 --> 01:37:01.548]  Yeah, but you know, most of our troops now are bunkered down inside the green zone.
[01:37:01.568 --> 01:37:03.230]  We don't dare come out of the green zone.
[01:37:06.292 --> 01:37:09.093]  So, now in a fortress mentality?
[01:37:09.634 --> 01:37:13.596]  Right, I mean we're holed up inside the Green Zone, inside Baghdad.
[01:37:15.217 --> 01:37:17.738]  With truck bombs blowing up every other day at the gates?
[01:37:18.298 --> 01:37:25.302]  Yeah, you see, what the Iraqi resistance has done, which is so brilliant, is they're targeting their own people.
[01:37:26.422 --> 01:37:33.626]  They're telling their own people that they can never expect stability, which is all that Iraqis really want.
[01:37:34.488 --> 01:37:38.071]  They can never expect stability as long as the Americans are in the country.
[01:37:38.131 --> 01:37:44.436]  So, we can retreat inside the Green Zone and bunker down and say, well, at least we're safe.
[01:37:44.776 --> 01:37:49.300]  But meanwhile, all the Iraqis who are outside the Green Zone are being killed daily.
[01:37:50.583 --> 01:37:57.248]  You know, Ann Coulter was in an article a few weeks ago, and one of the neocon pundits, and she was like, our troops aren't brutal enough.
[01:37:57.328 --> 01:37:58.990]  They need to kill more civilians.
[01:37:59.310 --> 01:38:00.731]  She actually said that.
[01:38:00.771 --> 01:38:01.412]  I'm not kidding.
[01:38:01.432 --> 01:38:02.112]  That's ridiculous.
[01:38:02.853 --> 01:38:11.119]  Yeah, well, it's, I mean, I've heard Michael Savage say put people in camps, put, I mean, it's just, it's just... No, I think your point is excellent about the high school kid.
[01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:18.125]  I was standing online at the post office the other day, and a mother was sending a package to her son who was in Iraq.
[01:38:18.792 --> 01:38:20.713]  And he was asking her for pop-tarts.
[01:38:21.313 --> 01:38:22.374]  He wanted pop-tarts.
[01:38:22.434 --> 01:38:24.775]  That's what he wanted, and that's what he was sending.
[01:38:24.815 --> 01:38:26.576]  And I thought, this is awfully pointed.
[01:38:26.636 --> 01:38:28.858]  Here's a guy who may not come home.
[01:38:29.218 --> 01:38:34.201]  Indeed, the odds against him coming home are desperately high.
[01:38:34.821 --> 01:38:37.462]  And the poor son of a gun, all he wants is pop-tarts.
[01:38:38.343 --> 01:38:44.026]  This type, high school kids fighting against Iraqis who have
[01:38:44.864 --> 01:38:45.564]  I haven't heard the first.
[01:38:45.664 --> 01:38:47.705]  I've heard that Halliburton is cheating us, but I haven't heard the second.
[01:39:05.749 --> 01:39:06.690]  It is unbelievable.
[01:39:06.730 --> 01:39:08.110]  They won't even give them water filters.
[01:39:08.150 --> 01:39:11.732]  Instead they truck in water with salt.
[01:39:11.853 --> 01:39:12.633]  All of this is good.
[01:39:12.673 --> 01:39:17.976]  I think the really bad thing about this is it's not the army that's running the war.
[01:39:18.076 --> 01:39:18.976]  It's the bureaucrats.
[01:39:19.757 --> 01:39:25.680]  And isn't it true about the chicken hawks at the Pentagon that only one of them, Rumsfeld, was even in the military?
[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:28.042]  I wasn't aware that Rumsfeld was in.
[01:39:28.082 --> 01:39:30.363]  Yeah, he was a fighter pilot but never saw combat.
[01:39:30.863 --> 01:39:33.666]  No, I think that that's the really desperately bad thing.
[01:39:34.427 --> 01:39:41.974]  So they're off in their ivory towers eating filet mignon, and meanwhile high school kids are getting their heads blown off.
[01:39:42.214 --> 01:39:42.695]  That's true.
[01:39:44.887 --> 01:39:48.828]  And the military told him, we can't win this if you don't give us, you say, 300,000 or something?
[01:39:48.848 --> 01:39:57.030]  Well, I think the unfortunate thing is that if a general wants to stay in charge over there, he has to do what the bureaucrats tell him to do.
[01:39:57.550 --> 01:40:01.030]  If he argues, if he puts up some resistance, then he's out.
[01:40:02.011 --> 01:40:07.772]  So how long is this going, so how long do you see until, because again, I mean, I've had so many other analysts on,
[01:40:09.122 --> 01:40:14.369]  They're saying the next two years is going to end up being like Vietnam with people hanging off helicopters.
[01:40:14.869 --> 01:40:20.556]  Well, I don't know if it will get there that fast, but I go back to what I said before.
[01:40:21.017 --> 01:40:23.860]  Bush will not send any more troops over there.
[01:40:24.241 --> 01:40:26.163]  He will not send the required number of troops.
[01:40:28.012 --> 01:40:28.913]  You can bet on it.
[01:40:29.193 --> 01:40:31.455]  The situation can only deteriorate.
[01:40:31.495 --> 01:40:33.937]  Well, I've got Pentagon reports saying they need a draft.
[01:40:33.977 --> 01:40:35.658]  They've set up the draft boards again.
[01:40:35.678 --> 01:40:42.104]  They've introduced 12 different... If he reinstitutes the draft, he can't get any of his economic program through.
[01:40:42.164 --> 01:40:45.566]  Because immediately, overnight, he'll have an opposition here in the United States.
[01:40:46.227 --> 01:40:49.890]  And he wants that economic... He wants to kill Social Security.
[01:40:49.930 --> 01:40:50.551]  He wants to...
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:55.161]  He'll relieve the tax burden of the rich.
[01:40:55.221 --> 01:40:59.663]  These are things he's desperate to get done, and he can't do it if he didn't re-institute the draft.
[01:40:59.683 --> 01:41:00.603]  Yeah, but that's what I'm saying.
[01:41:00.643 --> 01:41:02.864]  Get this stuff passed the next six months, then he can do it.
[01:41:02.884 --> 01:41:04.865]  He'll be able to get this stuff passed in a couple of months.
[01:41:05.325 --> 01:41:08.847]  Professor, what if there's a terrorist attack in America, an even bigger one?
[01:41:09.067 --> 01:41:10.267]  That'll help him get the draft.
[01:41:10.547 --> 01:41:13.469]  Well, if there's going to be a terrorist attack, he'd have to manufacture it.
[01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:14.429]  Oh!
[01:41:14.549 --> 01:41:17.270]  Osama Bin Laden hasn't got the means to do it again.
[01:41:17.290 --> 01:41:19.351]  Oh, oh, yeah.
[01:41:21.288 --> 01:41:22.890]  Some of Bin Laden, the means to attack us.
[01:41:25.272 --> 01:41:30.777]  And I guess you were big honcho there at the CIA on Iraq and Iran back in the 80s.
[01:41:31.838 --> 01:41:40.967]  Sir, you told us our government really wasn't involved with Saddam, which I totally disagree with, because I've had a lot of people that were your colleagues on disagreeing with that.
[01:41:41.328 --> 01:41:42.909]  But let me ask you a question on this.
[01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:45.471]  Bin Laden, what's his connection to the CIA?
[01:41:47.138 --> 01:41:49.859]  Well, it's very out in the open.
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:58.483]  In the 1970s, he worked with the CIA against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan.
[01:41:58.843 --> 01:41:59.503]  Tim Osmond?
[01:41:59.523 --> 01:42:00.644]  Who?
[01:42:01.384 --> 01:42:02.945]  His code name in the U.S.
[01:42:02.965 --> 01:42:03.785]  was Tim Osmond.
[01:42:03.805 --> 01:42:05.886]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:42:06.166 --> 01:42:07.086]  I bet you didn't.
[01:42:07.426 --> 01:42:13.389]  No, honestly, I don't think you have to really make any...
[01:42:14.762 --> 01:42:16.804]  The connection is on the record.
[01:42:16.824 --> 01:42:18.065]  There's no question he did.
[01:42:18.085 --> 01:42:19.526]  Well, the connection goes on.
[01:42:19.586 --> 01:42:23.029]  I've got articles praising him as a young hero in the mid-eighties.
[01:42:23.069 --> 01:42:24.029]  So you say the seventies.
[01:42:24.670 --> 01:42:28.913]  Well, I'm trying to get my head around it.
[01:42:29.033 --> 01:42:34.117]  Yeah, it would have been in the eighties, too.
[01:42:34.157 --> 01:42:36.199]  There's no question he worked for the CIA.
[01:42:38.241 --> 01:42:39.802]  Oh, he worked for the CIA?
[01:42:39.922 --> 01:42:43.845]  Well, because he was helping in that Mujahideen effort.
[01:42:44.269 --> 01:42:50.895]  Yeah, well that's just the facts we've got here.
[01:42:50.915 --> 01:43:02.787]  I want to talk to Dan in Texas and a couple of other callers that are holding for you, but really, give me the time frame from your expertise on Iran and Iraq and the current situation and all of it.
[01:43:03.830 --> 01:43:06.711]  How long until we have the implosion in Iraq?
[01:43:07.751 --> 01:43:09.571]  And what do you think the exit strategy is going to be?
[01:43:09.691 --> 01:43:14.892]  Or will it just be keeping troops in forts so Bush can still declare victory?
[01:43:15.333 --> 01:43:17.193]  Well, the implosion has already taken place.
[01:43:17.473 --> 01:43:28.055]  And now, effectively, as I say, we're hunkered down inside the green zone and we're trying to... I don't really know what we're trying to do.
[01:43:28.095 --> 01:43:29.635]  We're trying to weather the storm.
[01:43:29.655 --> 01:43:31.836]  But what we're banking on is beyond me.
[01:43:33.067 --> 01:43:39.111]  But as far as giving it a date for when the house is going to cave in, I don't know.
[01:43:39.171 --> 01:43:40.952]  All I know is it's not going to get any better.
[01:43:43.154 --> 01:43:48.217]  Well you notice that in World War II in Vietnam we got film reels of the tales of what was going on.
[01:43:49.118 --> 01:43:55.523]  In this war it's always some reporter on a computer phone which is so blurry you can't see five feet past them.
[01:43:56.203 --> 01:43:59.766]  And then what we get from the foreign press is the total opposite from what our media is giving us.
[01:44:00.618 --> 01:44:09.102]  Well, as I say, that's all part of the fact that you can't go anywhere in Iraq without risking your life.
[01:44:10.042 --> 01:44:12.123]  It's a jungle.
[01:44:12.364 --> 01:44:26.490]  I've interviewed reporters that are Arabs, but are Americans, but are with major magazines in this country, and they say, outside the green zone, they do not dare go five feet from their apartment, you know, to get a pizza without armed guards.
[01:44:27.050 --> 01:44:30.312]  Yeah, you're hearing the same thing I'm hearing.
[01:44:31.952 --> 01:44:39.114]  So, literally, ten feet outside the green zone, no one can... I mean... So that's failure right there!
[01:44:40.034 --> 01:44:41.234]  Oh, the whole thing is a failure.
[01:44:41.914 --> 01:44:43.154]  It's an awful failure.
[01:44:43.415 --> 01:44:46.735]  Don't ever let anybody tell any of your listeners it's not a failure.
[01:44:49.376 --> 01:44:52.676]  And so, is that why we're now hearing they may be backing off going into Iran?
[01:44:53.857 --> 01:44:59.438]  You know, these guys are crazy enough so that they might try to go into Iran, but
[01:45:00.026 --> 01:45:05.550]  If they were to go into Iran, then our difficulties would be compounded 100 times over.
[01:45:05.570 --> 01:45:09.013]  In other words, for us, it's a no-win situation.
[01:45:09.133 --> 01:45:11.195]  We can't win it, no matter what we do.
[01:45:12.536 --> 01:45:17.780]  But in the age where double-thinking and illusion is king, they can just tell us we won, and then we'll all feel good.
[01:45:17.860 --> 01:45:21.803]  Yeah, but you know, Karl Marx used to say there's such a thing as the laws of motion.
[01:45:21.863 --> 01:45:23.885]  In other words, there's such a thing as reality.
[01:45:24.563 --> 01:45:27.950]  And you can spin the story as much as you want.
[01:45:28.291 --> 01:45:31.838]  In the meantime, Mother Nature just goes grinding on and things happen.
[01:45:32.018 --> 01:45:36.387]  So eventually, the contradiction becomes so great that everything blows up.
[01:45:37.805 --> 01:45:47.851]  Yeah, but somebody who follows the Trotskyite view, the New York Times, Lord Rove, Lord Rove told the New York Times that we control reality.
[01:45:47.891 --> 01:45:53.394]  We're an empire now, and we'll change reality with an edict tomorrow, and then change it the next day.
[01:45:53.454 --> 01:45:57.977]  So, does that show a megalomaniacal insanity to start saying they control reality?
[01:45:58.197 --> 01:46:07.302]  Well, no, I think it's a fairly shrewd assessment of the Bush administration's control over the media here in the United States, but that doesn't say anything about Iraq.
[01:46:07.947 --> 01:46:14.591]  If we can't walk outside the green zone, then obviously we don't control reality outside the green zone.
[01:46:15.411 --> 01:46:23.616]  And as a consequence, sooner or later, what goes on in the streets of Baghdad is going to finish us.
[01:46:24.516 --> 01:46:30.299]  You know, how did the neocons that are on talk radio say that Bush is cutting government when we have the biggest budget ever, 2.6 trill?
[01:46:32.509 --> 01:46:33.289]  Well, you tell me.
[01:46:33.450 --> 01:46:41.754]  I mean, as I said a while ago, Bush, it's a most deceitful government, and how anybody can believe him is beyond me.
[01:46:42.714 --> 01:46:44.515]  Let's take a call for you, Professor.
[01:46:45.216 --> 01:46:47.777]  Dan in Texas, thanks for holding your on the air with our guest.
[01:46:47.797 --> 01:46:48.097]  Go ahead.
[01:46:48.698 --> 01:46:49.878]  Yes, Alex.
[01:46:51.439 --> 01:46:58.483]  Mr. Peltier, I would be most interested in hearing your political, geopolitical, analytical view
[01:46:59.609 --> 01:47:16.793]  Of the recent actions by China with the huge purchase of oil and gas in Iran, the recent relationship it struck up with Venezuela, and its efforts... And also their defense strategy with Russia.
[01:47:16.973 --> 01:47:18.913]  I can relate to this oil very well.
[01:47:19.914 --> 01:47:23.794]  My book, America's Oil Wars, goes into this quite deeply.
[01:47:25.075 --> 01:47:26.435]  My theory is
[01:47:27.490 --> 01:47:38.737]  One of the reasons we went to war with Iraq was because Saddam Hussein was threatening our control over the oil of the Persian Gulf.
[01:47:39.397 --> 01:47:50.424]  As you're aware, I'm talking to the listener now, Dan, it's becoming increasingly more and more difficult for countries to sew up supplies of oil.
[01:47:51.397 --> 01:47:56.403]  Uh, not only China is roving all over the world looking for oil, but so is India.
[01:47:56.523 --> 01:47:58.225]  Because of their industrial explosion.
[01:47:58.305 --> 01:48:01.188]  Yeah, and as a consequence, um...
[01:48:01.974 --> 01:48:25.264]  Suddenly, countries like Venezuela, which used to be, you know, third, fourth rate countries, now are, I won't say, well, their position is very much enhanced, because they have oil, people are coming to them, like the Chinese, looking for oil, and they therefore can thumb their nose at the United States.
[01:48:25.284 --> 01:48:30.787]  You know, we've already once tried to overthrow the regime of Hugo Chavez, and we did it,
[01:48:31.598 --> 01:48:36.099]  Because we recognize we're losing control of Benzoyl and oil.
[01:48:36.499 --> 01:48:47.861]  And my theory is we overthrew the regime of Saddam Hussein because we feared Saddam Hussein was not only going to deny us Iraq's oil, but the oil of the Persian Gulf.
[01:48:48.441 --> 01:48:57.203]  Well, specifically, going back to the weekend before our election in November, when China made the deal with Iran,
[01:48:58.304 --> 01:49:08.210]  They also released a statement to the Bush administration not to get to thinking that the 21st century would belong exclusively to America.
[01:49:08.230 --> 01:49:10.051]  That's what the CIA has said!
[01:49:10.071 --> 01:49:11.792]  Would you foresee China in any way
[01:49:17.858 --> 01:49:23.420]  Uh, aiding or abetting Iran in the event that... Well, they already are!
[01:49:23.460 --> 01:49:25.380]  They've got 40,000 engineers there at any one time!
[01:49:25.400 --> 01:49:35.503]  I think that what we're going to... I think what we have to accept is that no matter what the Bush administration says, the United States does not rule the world.
[01:49:35.603 --> 01:49:37.203]  It's a multi-power world.
[01:49:37.223 --> 01:49:38.784]  China, Russia, Europe,
[01:49:41.391 --> 01:49:58.279]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.439 --> 01:50:02.881]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:03.001 --> 01:50:07.363]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.403 --> 01:50:08.784]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.564 --> 01:50:10.885]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:39.224 --> 01:50:39.925]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.590 --> 01:50:55.211]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:50:55.331 --> 01:50:59.435]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:50:59.575 --> 01:51:02.457]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:51:02.537 --> 01:51:09.263]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:51:09.443 --> 01:51:12.445]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:51:12.665 --> 01:51:15.047]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:51:15.188 --> 01:51:23.074]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:51:23.354 --> 01:51:34.640]  Bactozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[01:51:34.801 --> 01:51:42.565]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:52:56.407 --> 01:53:02.430]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:03.050 --> 01:53:06.011]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:06.591 --> 01:53:18.896]  We're talking to Professor Dr. Steve Pelletier, and I want to get to, I know we've got a bunch of phone calls, but he's got to leave us here in a few minutes, so I'll try to go to Jim and Radkin and others here in a second.
[01:53:19.196 --> 01:53:20.957]  But during the break, we were talking, sir,
[01:53:21.852 --> 01:53:27.105]  And again, you were a former CIA senior analyst at Langley during the Iran-Iraq War.
[01:53:28.193 --> 01:53:29.174]  I brought it up during the break.
[01:53:29.254 --> 01:53:32.857]  I said, well you said Bush would have to manufacture a terror attack if there was going to be a new one.
[01:53:33.218 --> 01:53:36.820]  And I said, are you saying Bush is capable of manufacturing an attack?
[01:53:37.141 --> 01:53:39.423]  Will you tell people what you said to me during the break?
[01:53:39.963 --> 01:53:43.426]  Well, I do think he's capable of manufacturing an attack.
[01:53:43.486 --> 01:53:48.010]  I think this is one of the darndest administrations... I'm 73 years old.
[01:53:48.050 --> 01:53:49.251]  I've seen a lot of presidents.
[01:53:49.271 --> 01:53:51.072]  This is the darndest thing I've ever seen.
[01:53:51.653 --> 01:53:52.934]  The way these people lie to us.
[01:53:55.623 --> 01:53:57.884]  And they seem quite ruthless and power-mad.
[01:53:58.965 --> 01:54:00.786]  Oh, there's no question about that.
[01:54:01.707 --> 01:54:02.727]  And look at America.
[01:54:02.788 --> 01:54:04.288]  All this talk of fighting tyranny.
[01:54:04.308 --> 01:54:07.771]  You know, they're passing national ID cards and secret arrest.
[01:54:07.851 --> 01:54:10.933]  I mean, they're dismantling this country, sir.
[01:54:11.433 --> 01:54:11.733]  Yeah.
[01:54:13.474 --> 01:54:15.315]  It's unbelievable.
[01:54:15.776 --> 01:54:16.876]  But more and more people.
[01:54:16.916 --> 01:54:19.458]  I mean, I've talked to like four-star generals, admirals.
[01:54:20.180 --> 01:54:22.521]  Good afternoon Mr. Jones and Mr. Peltier.
[01:54:49.639 --> 01:55:00.288]  This seems to be going the way of the human animalistic instincts, but I was just wondering, out of curiosity, are guardsmen being over there and all?
[01:55:01.469 --> 01:55:07.914]  God bless them and God help them, I guess, but where are we going to get enough guardsmen
[01:55:08.806 --> 01:55:11.507]  Repeal the positions of the ones that are coming back.
[01:55:11.567 --> 01:55:14.067]  Yeah, Guardsmen's sign-up is at record lows.
[01:55:14.647 --> 01:55:16.948]  Yeah, I don't know where we're going to get them.
[01:55:16.988 --> 01:55:22.749]  By the way, I live in Pennsylvania too, and I know the Pennsylvanians are taking a really hard hit with this one.
[01:55:22.789 --> 01:55:24.529]  We've got more over there.
[01:55:24.569 --> 01:55:27.030]  I think only Texas and California are ahead of us.
[01:55:27.630 --> 01:55:31.971]  Yeah, well, we're in pain and poverty and misery and despair in Pennsylvania.
[01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:32.991]  You'll find us there.
[01:55:33.642 --> 01:55:35.742]  Well, that's part of this economic control.
[01:55:35.822 --> 01:55:39.483]  You want a large underclass whose only chance is the military.
[01:55:39.743 --> 01:55:40.363]  That's right.
[01:55:40.423 --> 01:55:40.944]  Exactly.
[01:55:42.824 --> 01:55:44.784]  I really appreciate your show, Mr. Jones.
[01:55:45.905 --> 01:55:53.246]  You have the patience of I don't know what, and Dr. Pelletier, I can appreciate your scholarship, insight into these things.
[01:55:54.466 --> 01:55:57.387]  You may not agree 100% with Mr. Jones or whomever.
[01:55:57.927 --> 01:56:03.028]  No one agrees 100%, but I was just wondering, okay, so they sent troops back,
[01:56:03.564 --> 01:56:06.285]  But they're going to eventually send those back.
[01:56:07.086 --> 01:56:09.847]  And every move we make, we have to tell you the United Nations.
[01:56:10.667 --> 01:56:12.888]  Yeah, and don't forget what else is going on.
[01:56:13.589 --> 01:56:19.111]  One by one, the allies who are with us in Iraq are dropping out.
[01:56:19.171 --> 01:56:20.592]  The Ukrainians are pulling out.
[01:56:20.612 --> 01:56:24.554]  The Poles have cut their force in half.
[01:56:24.574 --> 01:56:26.415]  The Spanish pulled out a year ago.
[01:56:26.455 --> 01:56:27.595]  The Dutch are pulling out.
[01:56:27.615 --> 01:56:31.497]  And every time someone pulls out, we've got to send troops in.
[01:56:32.014 --> 01:56:39.018]  And Afghanistan is still a mess, and who knows where else in this world, but by the same token, it's insanity.
[01:56:39.218 --> 01:56:40.799]  I'll agree with that to a point.
[01:56:40.859 --> 01:56:51.586]  I'm not a very well-educated person on military affairs especially, but by the same token as Mr. Jones stated, just common sense, the poopy's gonna hit the fan sooner or later.
[01:56:52.089 --> 01:56:55.552]  I would leave you with this fact, and that is that
[01:57:15.623 --> 01:57:18.365]  It's not the military that's fighting the war in Iraq.
[01:57:18.505 --> 01:57:19.405]  It's the Pentagon.
[01:57:19.465 --> 01:57:20.406]  It's the bureaucrats.
[01:57:20.506 --> 01:57:22.227]  It's the civilians in the Pentagon.
[01:57:22.267 --> 01:57:23.088]  And why do they care?
[01:57:23.128 --> 01:57:24.208]  They're making a mess of it.
[01:57:24.429 --> 01:57:25.589]  Their kids aren't being sent.
[01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:29.432]  They're walking around in $5,000 gowns flipping people off.
[01:57:29.712 --> 01:57:30.432]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:30.573 --> 01:57:31.593]  I appreciate you joining us, sir.
[01:57:31.613 --> 01:57:31.873]  Very good.
[01:57:31.893 --> 01:57:32.554]  God bless.
[01:57:32.574 --> 01:57:33.194]  Thank you very much.
[01:57:33.714 --> 01:57:37.577]  Alright, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are two of the websites.
[01:57:37.637 --> 01:57:38.177]  Check them out.
[01:57:38.578 --> 01:57:40.719]  Third Hour and the National ID Card coming up.
[01:57:50.308 --> 01:57:50.948]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.609 --> 01:57:52.689]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.370 --> 01:57:54.510]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.110 --> 01:57:55.991]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.711 --> 01:57:57.592]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.612 --> 01:58:02.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.454 --> 01:58:06.616]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.457 --> 01:58:19.923]  Well, last hour, we had the former director, in the 1980s, of the CIA's entire analyst group,
[01:58:21.901 --> 01:58:28.306]  Dan, one of the chief advisors and professors of the Army War College, saying that there's a terror attack.
[01:58:28.346 --> 01:58:30.388]  He expects it'll be the government carrying it out.
[01:58:31.088 --> 01:58:33.590]  Are you starting to get it, folks?
[01:58:34.411 --> 01:58:42.637]  Are you starting to understand just how serious things really are?
[01:58:44.439 --> 01:58:49.203]  The police state is being put in place so the globalists can take everything you've got.
[01:58:49.383 --> 01:58:50.944]  Your children for a national draft,
[01:58:52.305 --> 01:59:01.834]  All these new taxation mechanisms with the national sales tax as a quote, reform on top of national toll roads.
[01:59:03.815 --> 01:59:07.359]  The new national ID card law, they're on the verge of passing.
[01:59:07.979 --> 01:59:09.961]  Goes after gun owners and Christians.
[01:59:10.321 --> 01:59:11.863]  That's Ron Paul's office, by the way.
[01:59:13.744 --> 01:59:14.065]  Books!
[01:59:14.759 --> 01:59:16.239]  It's a Twilight Zone episode.
[01:59:16.259 --> 01:59:18.060]  You just walked right into the middle of it.
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:23.201]  Maybe you didn't know it was going on, but you just walked into an episode of it.
[01:59:23.341 --> 01:59:25.561]  Okay, maybe you didn't know it was happening, but it was always there.
[01:59:26.261 --> 01:59:27.742]  And you just tuned in for the first time.
[01:59:29.102 --> 01:59:30.382]  You better take us serious.
[01:59:30.422 --> 01:59:31.782]  You better listen to what we're saying.
[01:59:32.283 --> 01:59:33.763]  This is really going on.
[01:59:34.183 --> 01:59:35.743]  This is really happening.
[01:59:36.503 --> 01:59:42.105]  And when The Globalist and Nuka City release a camera bio, all bets are off it goes to the next level.
[01:59:43.065 --> 01:59:43.985]  The next level of Hades.
[01:59:45.203 --> 01:59:47.424]  And, uh, that's why they're so arrogant.
[01:59:47.444 --> 01:59:48.405]  That's why they're confident.
[01:59:49.446 --> 01:59:52.908]  And they don't care if our troops are pinned down and dying and being overused.
[01:59:53.268 --> 01:59:55.569]  I mean, nobody puts troops into combat for more than a year.
[01:59:55.650 --> 01:59:56.410]  It just doesn't work.
[01:59:56.630 --> 01:59:57.451]  They fall apart.
[01:59:58.211 --> 01:59:59.452]  Uh, two years isn't enough.
[01:59:59.472 --> 02:00:00.713]  Now they're saying it may be four years.
[02:00:03.174 --> 02:00:04.335]  Why are they so arrogant?
[02:00:04.375 --> 02:00:13.921]  Because they got plans for a draft, the bills are introduced, and when they set a city ablaze in a bright flash, they're gonna draft your children, folks.
[02:00:14.963 --> 02:00:16.504]  They're going to do medical experiments on them.
[02:00:16.524 --> 02:00:18.046]  They're going to use them like toilet paper.
[02:00:19.387 --> 02:00:20.969]  And I'm just trying to stop this.
[02:00:21.089 --> 02:00:21.849]  I love humanity.
[02:00:21.889 --> 02:00:22.670]  I love this country.
[02:00:22.690 --> 02:00:23.351]  I love God.
[02:00:23.971 --> 02:00:24.692]  And I hate evil.
[02:00:25.693 --> 02:00:28.836]  And Christians are being arrested for their political speech all over the country.
[02:00:30.137 --> 02:00:31.378]  Tyranny is upon us.
[02:00:31.418 --> 02:00:34.481]  People are being arrested for anti-war signs on street corners.
[02:00:35.082 --> 02:00:40.867]  The basic cannons and pillars and foundation of what America is is being demolished.
[02:00:41.494 --> 02:00:45.277]  Decimated, annihilated, incinerated, terminated.
[02:00:47.978 --> 02:00:54.343]  And we've got a bunch of delusional, power-tripping, megalomaniacs running things.
[02:00:54.623 --> 02:00:56.404]  And I mean, that's not negative to say that.
[02:00:57.424 --> 02:00:59.184]  Again, we don't live inside our own minds.
[02:00:59.224 --> 02:01:01.005]  The world isn't dictated by what we think.
[02:01:01.025 --> 02:01:02.325]  You know, they've sold you on this.
[02:01:02.505 --> 02:01:04.425]  Well, if you just feel a way, that's how it is.
[02:01:04.766 --> 02:01:10.587]  Well, that defies the laws of gravity, of science, of every action as an equal or greater reaction.
[02:01:10.607 --> 02:01:12.047]  It just denies the facts.
[02:01:13.247 --> 02:01:21.349]  And as you can sit there as a yuppie, denying everything, because you've got your little status symbols, you're in the process of being enslaved.
[02:01:21.369 --> 02:01:22.849]  You're in the process of being shackled.
[02:01:23.529 --> 02:01:26.430]  And all the slick packaging and space-age propaganda
[02:01:27.139 --> 02:01:29.901]  Can't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.
[02:01:31.402 --> 02:01:38.127]  All we can do is assess the serious trouble we're in in this crash landing and try to salvage something out of it.
[02:01:39.268 --> 02:01:51.576]  We've been put into a global crisis so they can bring in their new world order so Europe and the UN can look like the bad cop after America has done failing in Iraq and causing, starting a war with Iran and police state here at home.
[02:01:53.317 --> 02:01:55.479]  And the good cop's gonna come and it's gonna be even worse.
[02:01:56.505 --> 02:01:58.526]  Now that's how the chips fall, that's what we're facing.
[02:02:00.367 --> 02:02:05.330]  Gary and Tim and others will get to your calls, and the toll free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:05.590 --> 02:02:10.213]  We'll get to Redkin and Vermont and others as well.
[02:02:10.653 --> 02:02:16.497]  I got just a whole stack of vital news and information that, believe me, is vital to the future of this Republic.
[02:02:17.357 --> 02:02:25.722]  We'll cover it when we return, and we're also scheduled to have somebody on from Ron Paul's office to talk about this beefing up of the national ID card legislation.
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:32.936]  That is a set to pass the house today unless there's a miracle so that's the
[02:02:34.156 --> 02:02:36.477]  Report for you as of this time on that.
[02:02:37.078 --> 02:02:41.961]  More details as we chronicle the criminal activities of the New World Order on the other side.
[02:02:42.401 --> 02:02:45.422]  PrisonPlanet.tv is just one of my websites.
[02:02:45.843 --> 02:02:52.667]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[02:02:53.007 --> 02:02:54.368]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.568 --> 02:02:55.948]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.909 --> 02:02:59.011]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.271 --> 02:03:04.215]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.556 --> 02:03:08.599]  The Road of Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:10.621]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.701 --> 02:03:16.166]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control program,
[02:03:16.406 --> 02:03:21.349]  The Cashless Society Control Grid, Satellite Tracking, Invitable Microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.469 --> 02:03:23.390]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:25.731]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today.
[02:03:25.891 --> 02:03:27.412]  And man the guns of the InfoWars.
[02:03:27.552 --> 02:03:29.113]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[02:03:29.133 --> 02:03:29.433]  That's 888-2533139.
[02:03:29.453 --> 02:03:31.934]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[02:03:31.954 --> 02:03:32.995]  Again, that number, 888-2533139.
[02:03:45.885 --> 02:03:54.969]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.209 --> 02:04:06.434]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.774 --> 02:04:12.477]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:12.737 --> 02:04:19.403]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:19.603 --> 02:04:26.428]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:26.689 --> 02:04:28.470]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:04:28.730 --> 02:04:30.792]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:04:30.992 --> 02:04:33.874]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[02:04:33.915 --> 02:04:34.395]  Call New Millennium at 888-
[02:04:37.117 --> 02:04:39.001]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at Berkeywater.com.
[02:04:44.672 --> 02:04:47.795]  Are you and your family members getting enough minerals in their daily diet?
[02:04:48.095 --> 02:04:50.377]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:04:50.597 --> 02:04:57.723]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:04:57.943 --> 02:05:03.308]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:05:03.568 --> 02:05:10.994]  Kids who may not be doing as well in school and having a hard time studying ought to be looking at a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:05:11.194 --> 02:05:12.315]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:05:12.535 --> 02:05:22.079]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call for Sea Minerals at 877-817-9829 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost in the immune system.
[02:05:22.379 --> 02:05:26.720]  Sea Minerals provides a complete and balanced set of minerals and trace elements found in our oceans.
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:31.862]  Reclaim that youthful and energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help from Minerals from the Sea.
[02:05:32.042 --> 02:05:33.683]  Call for Sea Minerals today at 877-817-9829.
[02:05:33.703 --> 02:05:34.123]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:05:34.143 --> 02:05:35.063]  Or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[02:05:46.568 --> 02:05:48.749]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.309 --> 02:05:52.171]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.271 --> 02:05:59.674]  Alright, here's the deal.
[02:06:00.154 --> 02:06:04.156]  You've got callers holding for over an hour in some cases.
[02:06:04.196 --> 02:06:04.997]  I don't like doing that.
[02:06:05.017 --> 02:06:09.479]  So I'm going to blast through five calls and get back into the national ID card news.
[02:06:09.799 --> 02:06:10.699]  New developments there.
[02:06:10.759 --> 02:06:11.479]  Big developments.
[02:06:12.120 --> 02:06:13.360]  How it affects you and your family.
[02:06:13.380 --> 02:06:14.581]  A bunch of other global news.
[02:06:15.484 --> 02:06:18.006]  Yeah, that was the petition in Texas, the first hour.
[02:06:38.337 --> 02:06:44.681]  Well, I tell you, it's prompted me to decide to start a petition in my own state here to kind of nip it in the bud before it even starts over here, up in Utah.
[02:06:44.701 --> 02:06:44.881]  Go ahead.
[02:07:06.638 --> 02:07:11.020]  No, it's just that people need to start standing up and stopping this.
[02:07:12.300 --> 02:07:17.443]  We need more, as you say, people to wake others up as to what's going on.
[02:07:17.463 --> 02:07:22.605]  I listen to your show and it just seems to get worse and worse every day.
[02:07:22.625 --> 02:07:25.266]  And it's disheartening.
[02:07:26.787 --> 02:07:31.869]  There is a wild orgy of corruption going on, just a mass looting of everything.
[02:07:32.149 --> 02:07:32.970]  It's horrible.
[02:07:33.590 --> 02:07:36.171]  It's as black as black can be.
[02:07:36.994 --> 02:07:40.855]  But I just wanted to thank you because I was listening to that story and I said, you know what?
[02:07:40.955 --> 02:07:41.855]  I'm going to do something.
[02:07:41.875 --> 02:07:45.736]  I have a computer and I can do something.
[02:07:45.836 --> 02:07:47.056]  All of us can do something.
[02:07:47.116 --> 02:07:50.277]  It's all of us doing a little something together and move mountains.
[02:07:50.317 --> 02:07:50.997]  Thanks for the call.
[02:07:51.037 --> 02:07:51.397]  Thank you.
[02:07:51.658 --> 02:07:52.498]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:07:52.558 --> 02:07:53.158]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:07:53.178 --> 02:07:53.778]  You're on the air.
[02:07:55.318 --> 02:07:56.079]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:07:56.239 --> 02:07:56.739]  Hello, Tim.
[02:07:57.299 --> 02:08:00.960]  The Gitmo-style torture paper you read earlier?
[02:08:02.460 --> 02:08:02.960]  Well, yes.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:04.781]  They're going to have a MADFORD TV
[02:08:07.429 --> 02:08:08.390]  Reality show.
[02:08:08.610 --> 02:08:09.010]  Right, right.
[02:08:09.511 --> 02:08:09.931]  I heard that.
[02:08:09.991 --> 02:08:11.572]  I wanted to ask you a question about that.
[02:08:11.712 --> 02:08:16.136]  Doesn't that remind you of the old movie, Quiet Rage?
[02:08:16.156 --> 02:08:18.478]  Do you remember the Stanford Prison Experiment?
[02:08:19.098 --> 02:08:19.379]  Yes.
[02:08:19.499 --> 02:08:20.700]  Well, I mean, The Running Man.
[02:08:21.821 --> 02:08:22.621]  Oh yeah, The Running Man, too.
[02:08:22.661 --> 02:08:23.402]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:08:23.462 --> 02:08:25.844]  But for those that just joined us, this is the London Guardian.
[02:08:26.264 --> 02:08:35.992]  UK lines up Guantanamo-style torture reality show where seven Muslim men are being paid to let them torture them in a Guantanamo-style prison camp
[02:08:36.661 --> 02:08:38.963]  And this is all conditioning, folks.
[02:08:39.163 --> 02:08:41.005]  All of these shows, all of this programming.
[02:08:41.025 --> 02:08:44.688]  In fact, a few months ago, I did a TV show, you know, 10 minutes of the hour long program.
[02:08:44.728 --> 02:08:45.969]  It's on personappointed.tv.
[02:08:46.710 --> 02:08:47.551]  And I know Joe Rogan.
[02:08:47.571 --> 02:08:48.412]  He knows about the New World Order.
[02:08:48.452 --> 02:08:49.953]  He's contacted me when he comes to Austin.
[02:08:49.973 --> 02:08:50.574]  He calls me up.
[02:08:51.054 --> 02:08:57.480]  But, I mean, I told Joe, you know, your show, Fear Factor, is conditioning people, desensitizing them to all this stuff.
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:00.843]  But, I mean, now they've taken all pretenses away.
[02:09:01.223 --> 02:09:03.165]  It's just, yeah, we're going to have a show where we do torture.
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:04.920]  Unbelievable.
[02:09:04.981 --> 02:09:06.702]  Are you familiar with that Quiet Rage?
[02:09:07.883 --> 02:09:17.291]  Oh yeah, I'm familiar with how they gave people power and did a test and what like 70 plus percent of people would actually torture people to death in order to do so.
[02:09:18.452 --> 02:09:20.313]  It's amazing how it imitates in real life.
[02:09:20.553 --> 02:09:22.635]  Yeah, tell folks the details of that.
[02:09:24.156 --> 02:09:30.802]  Basically what they did was they took two volunteers, two groups, just like this story you're reading today.
[02:09:31.402 --> 02:09:33.204]  Some were made guards, the other were made prisoners.
[02:09:33.934 --> 02:09:51.609]  And the people that were made the guard just assumed such dictatorial power that, you know, these people were bailing out the ones that were the prisoners within 24 hours because the treatment to them was just so bad that the people just totally went torture crazy.
[02:09:52.830 --> 02:09:56.894]  And then they told them, they told them, this is actually a government program, we're really going to torture them.
[02:09:57.074 --> 02:09:58.195]  Hit the button and kill them!
[02:09:58.535 --> 02:10:00.517]  And they would hit the button believing they were killing people.
[02:10:00.942 --> 02:10:04.765]  Now, isn't Stanford a little arm of our buddies at the Tavistock Institute?
[02:10:04.965 --> 02:10:07.548]  Well, it is, and I was going to bring this up.
[02:10:07.708 --> 02:10:10.770]  All over the country, England's doing big studies, quote, in torture.
[02:10:11.491 --> 02:10:13.273]  How do people fight back against torture?
[02:10:13.593 --> 02:10:16.355]  How did our troops in Vietnam not break under torture?
[02:10:16.555 --> 02:10:20.419]  They're finding the secrets to breaking people in torture in all these big British and U.S.
[02:10:20.439 --> 02:10:21.680]  studies that are going on right now.
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:24.322]  Very unethical, being paid for by our governments.
[02:10:25.095 --> 02:10:32.660]  Uh, so, uh, and then they, again, they got Threat Matrix 24, uh, CSI Miami, on all these shows.
[02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:46.509]  People are getting chips under their skin, they're being tortured, they're being tortured to death, and then a show called Spooks in England, we, we, we put the transcript of the show up on one of their episodes, they torture the terrorist's eight-year-old daughter, and then they're gonna kill her to stop the terrorist.
[02:10:46.549 --> 02:10:49.591]  And the moral of the story is, torturing children is good.
[02:10:49.612 --> 02:10:50.512]  Thanks for the call.
[02:10:51.313 --> 02:10:53.354]  It's just a mass warping of the mind.
[02:10:53.394 --> 02:10:54.815]  And then, as well, it's to stop terrorists.
[02:10:55.435 --> 02:11:06.999]  But you just heard, during the last hour, the Chief Analyst of the CIA, in the 1980s, tell you that he thinks that if there's another terror attack, it's going to be the U.S.
[02:11:07.039 --> 02:11:07.760]  government doing it.
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:15.802]  Chief Analyst, for eight years, for Reagan, at the CIA.
[02:11:18.442 --> 02:11:24.809]  And we've had the Chief Liaison, his Chief Personal Advisor, Ray McGovern on talking about similar stuff.
[02:11:26.111 --> 02:11:29.535]  These are people, I was talking to the professor during the break, he goes, well I consider myself to be a conservative.
[02:11:30.256 --> 02:11:35.602]  And I talk to, I mean folks, I talk to admirals, I talk to generals, I mean you've heard them on air, but I talk to them off air.
[02:11:36.664 --> 02:11:38.365]  And why they're calling me, I have no idea.
[02:11:38.465 --> 02:11:45.549]  And I mean, these are people who just got out, or currently in, or... I mean, some of these are pretty young people, 55, 60 years old.
[02:11:45.969 --> 02:11:46.829]  They're saying this.
[02:11:46.849 --> 02:11:56.074]  I mean, folks, if you've got a brain in your head... It's like Hitler's General Staff, you know, who'd gone along with it for a while, but now they're just going, man, this guy's completely insane!
[02:11:57.855 --> 02:12:01.597]  Once he, you know, really got the death farms cooking, you know, in the early 1940s.
[02:12:03.007 --> 02:12:04.368]  He started slow.
[02:12:04.388 --> 02:12:06.669]  A lot of people are going, man, what is going on?
[02:12:06.709 --> 02:12:08.250]  This is crazy.
[02:12:11.351 --> 02:12:15.933]  But again, the mindless, drooling yuppies just think it's funny.
[02:12:15.973 --> 02:12:16.594]  They'll laugh at you.
[02:12:18.074 --> 02:12:19.655]  Wait until your kids get drafted.
[02:12:20.558 --> 02:12:21.299]  Just wait.
[02:12:21.759 --> 02:12:35.091]  And when your son or daughter comes back with their arms or legs blown off and they're not getting treatment, you'll be calling going, Alex, you know, this couple of years from now, we're even on the air then, Alex, I used to laugh at you, but you're right, my little boy, they won't know, you know.
[02:12:35.592 --> 02:12:38.554]  And it's just, you might as well wake up now and stand with America.
[02:12:39.135 --> 02:12:40.936]  They're dismantling this country.
[02:12:42.298 --> 02:12:45.861]  Every Bill Clinton program to attack free speech, Bush is expanding it.
[02:12:47.344 --> 02:12:49.745]  Remember Butch Reno going after pro-life demonstrators?
[02:12:49.765 --> 02:12:51.746]  Ooh, she's so bad that she was!
[02:12:52.367 --> 02:12:55.008]  Now they arrest him and give him 47 years in prison!
[02:12:56.329 --> 02:12:58.730]  I mean, everything Clinton did, it's worse!
[02:12:59.571 --> 02:13:03.633]  But you listen to a neocon on the radio, you'll never know it!
[02:13:05.314 --> 02:13:06.254]  You'll never know it!
[02:13:08.916 --> 02:13:10.557]  And a lot of the deception's real simple.
[02:13:10.657 --> 02:13:13.659]  It's basically, we need the National ID card, the liberals are against it!
[02:13:14.939 --> 02:13:16.220]  Call Congress, say you're for it!
[02:13:18.317 --> 02:13:22.099]  And then you look at the vote, the Democrats vote for it, and the only people who voted against it were Republicans.
[02:13:23.440 --> 02:13:24.361]  And maybe one Democrat.
[02:13:24.841 --> 02:13:28.924]  In the Senate, and maybe, I don't know, 10 or 15 in the House, but both of them were Republicans.
[02:13:30.424 --> 02:13:34.027]  So see, it's very sophomoric, it's like raw, raw football team mentality.
[02:13:36.288 --> 02:13:39.530]  They're getting, just, it's just getting ridiculous.
[02:13:40.691 --> 02:13:42.792]  And, uh, I don't know.
[02:13:43.579 --> 02:13:44.660]  Radkin in Vermont.
[02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:45.641]  Radkin, go ahead.
[02:13:46.201 --> 02:13:47.742]  Oh, thank you very much, Alex.
[02:13:47.802 --> 02:13:49.663]  You're so awesome.
[02:13:50.144 --> 02:14:05.875]  I listen with bated breath as you question people and then the pregnant pauses when their answer is off the wall, like when he said, speaking of the CIA fellow Pelletier you just interviewed, and I wanted to ask him,
[02:14:06.314 --> 02:14:15.741]  But what I was saying is when he answered the question about, or pro-offered that Osama was behind 9-1-1, I mean, I could hear you fall off your chair almost.
[02:14:16.502 --> 02:14:20.645]  But then later, he goes, well, the government's going to be behind the next one.
[02:14:21.125 --> 02:14:25.368]  Well, how come he didn't realize that was the case of 9-11 too?
[02:14:25.488 --> 02:14:29.211]  Well, he did say he'd been logged CIA.
[02:14:29.852 --> 02:14:35.656]  Well, it was very reluctantly that he admitted to what you were getting out of him as the CIA connection.
[02:14:36.024 --> 02:14:38.925]  Well, it took me years to wake up to the point I'm at.
[02:14:38.965 --> 02:14:43.126]  I mean, you know, these guys are having moral struggles right now.
[02:14:43.506 --> 02:14:46.547]  I want to talk to these people off air.
[02:14:46.847 --> 02:14:58.870]  I wanted to ask him how he felt safe to talk in the light of John O'Neill, who had leaked W1999I to Craig Pallas, and then
[02:14:59.355 --> 02:15:01.836]  Then was killed or maybe dead already.
[02:15:01.956 --> 02:15:04.297]  That was the Deputy FBI Director, yeah.
[02:15:04.518 --> 02:15:10.921]  Right, but also... Who told British TV the government's going to let Bin Laden attack us so they can get the oil in Iraq.
[02:15:11.481 --> 02:15:11.841]  Yeah.
[02:15:12.061 --> 02:15:12.862]  And that was his quote.
[02:15:13.462 --> 02:15:14.723]  The Hegelian Dialectic.
[02:15:14.803 --> 02:15:17.784]  I learned that from you guys.
[02:15:17.884 --> 02:15:19.645]  I wanted to ask him about Bill Colby.
[02:15:19.665 --> 02:15:20.726]  Do you remember Bill Colby?
[02:15:20.786 --> 02:15:22.907]  Apparently he was head of the CIA.
[02:15:23.795 --> 02:15:43.663]  And apparently he was one of twenty-five flag officers back in ninety-five that was going to charge Clinton with treason for having leaked... Yeah, and then witnesses would say men would walk in in military uniforms, gunshots, they'd walk in, oh, the people committed suicide, oh, they drowned in their canoes.
[02:15:43.743 --> 02:15:46.284]  Yeah, they said he fell out of a canoe in the Potomac.
[02:15:46.304 --> 02:15:48.425]  Well, he had a place right down the road from me.
[02:15:48.445 --> 02:15:52.927]  Look, he's the one, and I have this directly from the CIA, directly from the person that released the video.
[02:15:53.567 --> 02:15:59.670]  Directly, and it's now been admitted, he's the guy that released the flare footage of them killing the Davidians.
[02:15:59.750 --> 02:16:05.252]  And he just said, look, our government's not here to kill Americans, and I'm not going to be part of this, and so he had to go bye-bye.
[02:16:06.192 --> 02:16:08.173]  No kidding.
[02:16:08.193 --> 02:16:10.074]  What are they going to do when everybody starts talking?
[02:16:10.094 --> 02:16:10.934]  See, that's the problem.
[02:16:10.954 --> 02:16:11.975]  They can't kill everybody.
[02:16:13.975 --> 02:16:15.136]  They're doing a good job of it.
[02:16:15.583 --> 02:16:18.964]  Yeah, they've killed, now it's like 50-something microbiologists.
[02:16:19.124 --> 02:16:27.126]  I didn't know if, the reception up here on shortwave is a little rough sometimes, but I didn't know if the biochemist had come up in your conversation.
[02:16:27.146 --> 02:16:28.846]  With the CIA fellow.
[02:16:28.886 --> 02:16:30.467]  Yeah, not with the last guest.
[02:16:30.507 --> 02:16:31.767]  Thanks for the call, good to hear from you.
[02:16:32.327 --> 02:16:33.207]  I appreciate it.
[02:16:33.287 --> 02:16:34.047]  Ron in New York.
[02:16:34.127 --> 02:16:34.808]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:16:36.768 --> 02:16:37.608]  Hello, Ron!
[02:16:38.048 --> 02:16:38.909]  Come on down!
[02:16:40.149 --> 02:16:40.829]  Ron, are you there?
[02:16:40.849 --> 02:16:42.650]  Okay, he's gone.
[02:16:42.670 --> 02:16:44.010]  Emmett in Pennsylvania.
[02:16:44.030 --> 02:16:44.550]  Go ahead, Emmett.
[02:16:46.061 --> 02:16:53.787]  Yes, Alex, of all the things you get, I hope you receive my stamped CD of the Stamps Quartet singing.
[02:16:53.807 --> 02:16:56.149]  I did get a CD.
[02:16:56.169 --> 02:16:56.950]  Tell me what it is.
[02:16:58.011 --> 02:17:03.515]  It's a Stamps Quartet spanning from like 1958 till about 1978.
[02:17:04.496 --> 02:17:09.240]  The Stamps Quartet was the favorite of Elvis, by the way.
[02:17:10.781 --> 02:17:11.422]  Okay.
[02:17:13.183 --> 02:17:15.405]  To listen to it, it should make you very happy.
[02:17:18.237 --> 02:17:35.328]  Hey, uh, I was in a major supermarket last Friday, and this mother had a boy there about a year and a half, and another one about three, and she said to these two children, which were in one of those carts that looks like an automobile, get the rifle, get the rifle!
[02:17:36.088 --> 02:17:38.129]  And then she starts saying, shoot, shoot, shoot!
[02:17:38.250 --> 02:17:39.570]  And all the boys were laughing.
[02:17:39.610 --> 02:17:41.772]  She said, oh, you like that when I say shoot, shoot.
[02:17:42.172 --> 02:17:44.353]  What is the matter with this society?
[02:17:52.147 --> 02:17:57.330]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:17:58.290 --> 02:18:11.517]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:18:12.318 --> 02:18:17.601]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.

[02:18:57.894 --> 02:18:59.295]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:18:59.335 --> 02:18:59.755]  A 5% increase.
[02:19:00.355 --> 02:19:02.757]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[02:19:02.777 --> 02:19:06.420]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:19:15.672 --> 02:19:21.293]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.

[02:20:47.889 --> 02:20:58.256]  How many of you have tried the fad diets, you've tried the pills, you've tried counting calories, you've even tried other night time weight loss formulas and nothing seems to be working?
[02:20:58.536 --> 02:20:59.536]  You know what I suggest to you?

[02:21:53.079 --> 02:21:55.880]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.900 --> 02:22:02.062]  Alright, I got a bunch of news I want to cover, so let's check a few more calls and we'll come back to calls later.
[02:22:02.542 --> 02:22:04.943]  Finishing up what you were saying, Emmett.
[02:22:05.704 --> 02:22:05.964]  Yes.
[02:22:06.644 --> 02:22:17.368]  Well, that Stamps Quartet they sing, Once my day was gloomy as I traveled along, Then I joined their Christian band, Now my day grows brighter as I travel on.
[02:22:18.030 --> 02:22:22.032]  And every day keeps getting brighter as I travel along.
[02:22:22.132 --> 02:22:23.532]  This is classic, yes.
[02:22:23.572 --> 02:22:25.293]  Yeah, oh that was, oh that is classy.
[02:22:25.453 --> 02:22:28.214]  I haven't listened to it yet, but I like hearing you sing.
[02:22:28.234 --> 02:22:29.975]  Sing some more for us.
[02:22:30.075 --> 02:22:35.037]  I try to sing bass and also the treble, you know.
[02:22:36.678 --> 02:22:45.442]  But hey, what's Tex Mars was going on this weekend about all the money from Iraq is being funneled into Israel.
[02:22:46.583 --> 02:22:47.844]  And I thought of what you said.
[02:22:49.085 --> 02:22:58.071]  We're made to think that Israel's getting rich off this money, but it's the British and rich American bankers.
[02:22:58.951 --> 02:23:10.059]  Well, I mean, Israel, they're admittedly trying to build a pipeline into Israel to give them oil, and I wasn't familiar with them, and I know Israel gets a lot of money, so does Egypt, but I haven't heard the details, so I really can't comment.
[02:23:10.079 --> 02:23:11.680]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:13.181]  Get with your buddy TexMars.
[02:23:13.781 --> 02:23:14.982]  Yeah, I'll try to check it out.
[02:23:16.046 --> 02:23:17.366]  I appreciate it.
[02:23:17.547 --> 02:23:18.987]  Scott in Pennsylvania.
[02:23:19.047 --> 02:23:19.727]  Scott, go ahead.
[02:23:21.648 --> 02:23:22.188]  Or Michigan.
[02:23:22.208 --> 02:23:22.708]  Go ahead.
[02:23:24.308 --> 02:23:27.049]  Always by the third hour, stuff just disintegrates with the calls.
[02:23:27.089 --> 02:23:28.850]  It just gets wild.
[02:23:28.950 --> 02:23:30.150]  I'm tempted to... It's weird.
[02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:31.970]  First or second hour we take calls, it's all great.
[02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.610]  Everybody's there.
[02:23:32.650 --> 02:23:33.791]  It's all normal.
[02:23:34.251 --> 02:23:37.672]  Then we kind of descend into bunker land by the third hour.
[02:23:37.712 --> 02:23:41.753]  I may just start making the third hour news and guests because
[02:23:42.745 --> 02:23:44.547]  It's something else.
[02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:47.031]  Let's try Kevin in Colorado.
[02:23:47.071 --> 02:23:47.872]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:23:48.292 --> 02:23:49.514]  Hello, Mr. Alex.
[02:23:49.834 --> 02:23:50.695]  Yes, hello.
[02:23:51.236 --> 02:23:52.337]  How are you this afternoon?
[02:23:52.558 --> 02:23:53.559]  I'm doing a radio show.
[02:23:53.579 --> 02:23:54.100]  How are you?
[02:23:54.560 --> 02:23:55.621]  I'm doing great, man.
[02:23:55.922 --> 02:24:00.668]  I'm calling from Boulder, Colorado, home of the now infamous Ward Churchill.
[02:24:01.893 --> 02:24:03.354]  Are you familiar with this guy?
[02:24:03.674 --> 02:24:05.915]  Yeah, he's a big old tall guy.
[02:24:05.956 --> 02:24:08.237]  He's an Indian or Native American rights activist.
[02:24:08.277 --> 02:24:09.878]  He's pretty aggressive.
[02:24:10.458 --> 02:24:12.819]  And I've seen him do interviews with my friends here locally on TV.
[02:24:12.839 --> 02:24:15.221]  He kind of gets in their face, which is fine.
[02:24:16.622 --> 02:24:18.262]  And I agree with some of what he has to say.
[02:24:18.282 --> 02:24:19.803]  I mean, I think what happened to the Native Americans is wrong.
[02:24:19.843 --> 02:24:25.547]  But when he came out and said, Al-Qaeda attacked us because we're bad to indigenous people, he just plays into their plan.
[02:24:25.747 --> 02:24:27.888]  Al-Qaeda is CIA, you stupid punk!
[02:24:28.428 --> 02:24:33.670]  And the people that died in those towers didn't deserve what happened to them!
[02:24:33.890 --> 02:24:34.770]  You little weasel!
[02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:37.071]  And try to get in my face, Ward Churchill!
[02:24:37.171 --> 02:24:38.951]  You'll have a big problem, you punk!
[02:24:39.331 --> 02:24:40.492]  Alright, go ahead.
[02:24:41.992 --> 02:24:43.013]  You're something else, man.
[02:24:43.213 --> 02:24:46.274]  You know, I want you to think about something for a minute.
[02:24:47.154 --> 02:24:56.197]  I don't know if this is a connection or not, and it may be just a coincidence, but think about one of the last times the United States was duped into a major war.
[02:24:56.857 --> 02:24:57.497]  It was done
[02:24:58.081 --> 02:25:01.664]  In part, by a guy named Winston Churchill.
[02:25:02.505 --> 02:25:04.726]  Now, I don't know if there's a connection here.
[02:25:05.007 --> 02:25:08.690]  No, Churchill, that's his Indian name.
[02:25:08.710 --> 02:25:15.195]  I mean, that was an English name, and somewhere down the line, you know, one of the Native Americans he's related to took the name of Churchill.
[02:25:16.096 --> 02:25:21.960]  I personally think what he's trying to do, and this is just my opinion, I believe Ward Churchill is trying to create a race war.
[02:25:22.020 --> 02:25:27.565]  I just drove by CU, coming back home from my workout, and I gotta tell you, man, these
[02:25:28.234 --> 02:25:35.138]  All these socialists, well I don't know if you want to call them that, all these kids are just high-fiving everybody and all this stuff.
[02:25:35.198 --> 02:25:37.939]  It's like they're ready to go take up arms.
[02:25:39.360 --> 02:25:40.640]  And that plays into their plan.
[02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:48.905]  And look, it makes me mad when somebody comes out with a comment like, well the people that died there, you know, it's because they're evil.
[02:25:50.166 --> 02:25:53.348]  It's because, you know, they were part of the oppression of the third world.
[02:25:53.628 --> 02:25:55.489]  Folks, the globalists carried out 9-11.
[02:25:56.229 --> 02:26:01.952]  The globalists are using it as a pretext to invade and hurt those third world countries, and this guy plays right into it.
[02:26:02.252 --> 02:26:03.833]  Oh, it's a valiant, a bunch of them do.
[02:26:04.033 --> 02:26:07.975]  It's a valiant fight by the, you know, the underclass.
[02:26:07.995 --> 02:26:12.698]  You know, that's more of that fake leftist garbage that was written up by the government.
[02:26:14.458 --> 02:26:18.979]  And look, the reason I get in Churchill's face is that I've seen the guy in action here in Austin.
[02:26:18.999 --> 02:26:20.760]  I mean, he is really an arrogant bully.
[02:26:21.520 --> 02:26:22.420]  And I don't like bullies.
[02:26:22.900 --> 02:26:23.360]  I don't either.
[02:26:23.460 --> 02:26:27.241]  And that's why I don't like Schwarzenegger.
[02:26:27.261 --> 02:26:32.163]  It just gets my heckles up.
[02:26:33.543 --> 02:26:36.063]  You know, the dog gets mad, the fur puffs out.
[02:26:36.103 --> 02:26:38.224]  I mean, when I just see one of these punks, it gets me mad.
[02:26:38.945 --> 02:26:45.029]  Do you think Ward Churchill is in some way affiliated, either directly or indirectly, with the globalists?
[02:26:46.690 --> 02:26:53.755]  I just think, you know, he's on a power trip, a little darling of certain groups, and, you know, just thinks he's God's gift to the planet.
[02:26:53.835 --> 02:27:01.261]  And I think his sickening statements, you know, about people who are dead, makes me want to puke on him.
[02:27:01.281 --> 02:27:01.841]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:02.481 --> 02:27:03.102]  I appreciate it.
[02:27:03.142 --> 02:27:05.203]  I mean, that's all I can really say about Ward Churchill.
[02:27:06.464 --> 02:27:07.425]  I mean, he makes me sick.
[02:27:08.230 --> 02:27:10.651]  Uh, he plays into the hands of the neocons.
[02:27:10.991 --> 02:27:12.171]  Oh, look at this guy!
[02:27:12.231 --> 02:27:12.511]  See?
[02:27:12.531 --> 02:27:12.591]  See?
[02:27:13.071 --> 02:27:14.812]  He likes Bin Laden!
[02:27:15.012 --> 02:27:15.312]  See?
[02:27:15.612 --> 02:27:18.073]  Those that are against the war with Bin Laden!
[02:27:19.153 --> 02:27:19.293]  See?
[02:27:19.373 --> 02:27:19.593]  See?
[02:27:19.613 --> 02:27:23.454]  I mean, just... Maybe he knows what he's doing.
[02:27:23.474 --> 02:27:24.654]  I know some of these people do.
[02:27:25.855 --> 02:27:27.735]  We're not gonna win this thing unless we come together.
[02:27:29.015 --> 02:27:34.657]  And, uh, you know, to act like the 9-11 attacks were some indigenous revolt is disgusting.
[02:27:36.474 --> 02:27:39.476]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.377 --> 02:27:43.079]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.561 --> 02:27:51.542]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:27:51.702 --> 02:27:59.785]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:28:00.045 --> 02:28:07.087]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:28:07.287 --> 02:28:08.568]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:28:08.648 --> 02:28:14.532]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:28:14.732 --> 02:28:19.816]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:28:19.936 --> 02:28:28.802]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:28:29.082 --> 02:28:32.365]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:28:45.711 --> 02:28:49.933]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[02:28:50.693 --> 02:28:58.937]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[02:28:59.538 --> 02:29:01.278]  That's why you need verbal advantage.
[02:29:01.979 --> 02:29:02.599]  Why you listen,
[02:29:03.234 --> 02:29:07.956]  Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[02:29:08.576 --> 02:29:10.157]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[02:29:10.677 --> 02:29:12.838]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[02:29:13.438 --> 02:29:15.459]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[02:29:16.019 --> 02:29:17.100]  And it's so easy.
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:19.841]  To learn, you simply listen.
[02:29:20.681 --> 02:29:21.261]  When you want.
[02:29:21.841 --> 02:29:22.462]  Where you want.

[02:29:47.896 --> 02:29:53.381]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.802 --> 02:29:58.046]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:29:58.266 --> 02:30:05.313]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.693 --> 02:30:11.799]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.939 --> 02:30:13.160]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:16.444]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:30:16.584 --> 02:30:18.626]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:30:18.927 --> 02:30:26.155]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:30:26.456 --> 02:30:29.840]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:30:33.762 --> 02:30:34.923]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625 call today.
[02:30:52.882 --> 02:30:55.363]  Alright, welcome back.
[02:30:55.383 --> 02:30:57.665]  We've got about 26 minutes left.
[02:30:57.765 --> 02:31:01.547]  It's 33 minutes and 15 seconds into the third hour today.
[02:31:01.567 --> 02:31:02.687]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:31:03.028 --> 02:31:06.590]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:06.630 --> 02:31:08.210]  Our Earth has been turned into a prison planet.
[02:31:09.491 --> 02:31:10.972]  We've had Congressman Ron Paul, our
[02:31:11.943 --> 02:31:28.071]  America's congressman on, I don't know, probably 50 times over the years, but I'm honored to have his press secretary, Jeff Dice, on with us, one of the busiest men in America, who really passionately has been fighting with the congressman, fighting against the expansion of the national ID card.
[02:31:29.392 --> 02:31:39.777]  The first national ID card passed in December of last year was bad enough, and it was, quote, to stop illegal aliens, and of course it actually gave waivers to them, and started telling the states to accept their ID cards.
[02:31:41.078 --> 02:31:42.880]  Made it easier, quote, for terrorists to attack us.
[02:31:43.120 --> 02:31:46.103]  You can read Ron Paul's analysis of this at Infowars.com.
[02:31:46.403 --> 02:31:49.266]  And he goes over the five things this does.
[02:31:50.427 --> 02:31:55.672]  And it creates, really, a Pan-American ID card and more federal standardization.
[02:31:56.092 --> 02:31:58.975]  Just talking to Jeff during the break, and he was giving me a rundown.
[02:31:59.636 --> 02:32:01.077]  Jeff, good to have you on with us.
[02:32:01.177 --> 02:32:02.138]  Tell us what we're facing.
[02:32:03.112 --> 02:32:07.214]  Well, what we're facing is, as usual, political doublespeak.
[02:32:07.234 --> 02:32:15.857]  What we're facing is a Trojan horse that walks and talks and sounds like immigration control, but in reality just applies mostly to U.S.
[02:32:15.877 --> 02:32:19.099]  citizens, and the bad guys won't pay any heed to it at all.
[02:32:21.559 --> 02:32:23.120]  And the Congressman talked about that.
[02:32:23.160 --> 02:32:30.142]  He talks about how, you know, it's got, you know, this comment about, you know, illegal aliens, but no enforcement.
[02:32:30.582 --> 02:32:37.285]  And when they passed, say, more border patrol than the last bill, then the Secretary of Homeland Security takes that money out.
[02:32:37.785 --> 02:32:45.948]  And you were telling me during the break that Christian groups are out pushing this, that a lot of conservative groups have really bought this bait hook, line, and sinker.
[02:32:46.248 --> 02:32:47.448]  Well, unfortunately, yes.
[02:32:47.468 --> 02:32:49.489]  You know, on the Hill we see a lot of the different groups
[02:32:50.329 --> 02:32:53.030]  Yeah, the White House wants total amnesty and they've said it.
[02:32:53.070 --> 02:32:56.331]  Yeah, well you gotta say Bush has been pretty open about that.
[02:33:17.204 --> 02:33:19.725]  So this isn't about immigration at the end of the day.
[02:33:19.745 --> 02:33:22.326]  This is about ID cards for Americans.
[02:33:22.386 --> 02:33:32.991]  Well, I heard a top neocon on the radio this morning saying, the Democrats are going to be mad first Bush cuts the budget, actually expands it, but double think, and now he's going to stop the illegal aliens.
[02:33:33.431 --> 02:33:36.613]  Yeah, well, he's not going to do that and no one's even pretending.
[02:33:37.113 --> 02:33:42.195]  This bill unfortunately has duped a lot of people on the right, a lot of Christian conservatives,
[02:33:42.665 --> 02:33:44.346]  Because of the rhetoric.
[02:33:44.386 --> 02:33:54.630]  I mean, as you know, how many people really have the time or the inclination to know what's going on and read bills and know what's going on in the House floor from day to day amongst voters?
[02:33:54.690 --> 02:33:56.771]  It's pretty tough to keep up with.
[02:33:56.791 --> 02:34:01.872]  So they just tend to see what they do see is the rhetoric that comes out of the two parties.
[02:34:02.353 --> 02:34:05.274]  Yeah, and it's not just that people aren't reading the bills.
[02:34:05.334 --> 02:34:09.535]  They tune into neocons to get their news and get intentionally lied to.
[02:34:09.976 --> 02:34:10.696]  Sure, sure.
[02:34:11.334 --> 02:34:17.778]  But you start to have to ask yourself, do you want your state to issue you an ID that is a state ID and name only?
[02:34:17.818 --> 02:34:23.361]  It'll be a federal ID because it will be mandated by the feds what's on it.
[02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:28.524]  And do you really want to have that, which could potentially include biometric information, etc.?
[02:34:29.224 --> 02:34:33.807]  And you're going to need that to deal with the federal government at any level, and that includes TSA for travel.
[02:34:34.329 --> 02:34:37.832]  This has been a long time coming, and you're a fellow Texan.
[02:34:38.192 --> 02:34:42.916]  What, in 93, Clinton put in the thumb scanners and digital photos in Texas.
[02:34:43.737 --> 02:34:44.998]  We're way ahead of the curve now.
[02:34:45.299 --> 02:34:47.260]  The rest of the country's being ordered to put these in.
[02:34:48.561 --> 02:34:54.306]  Let's go blow by blow, if we can, through Ron Paul's comments in the analysis he put out last night.
[02:34:54.326 --> 02:34:55.047]  I want to get your comments.
[02:34:55.808 --> 02:35:01.432]  Number two, establish a federally coordinated database of personal information on American citizens with Canada and Mexico.
[02:35:03.337 --> 02:35:07.020]  Use the new national ID card to track American citizens when traveling outside the U.S.
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:08.361]  and within the U.S.
[02:35:08.982 --> 02:35:08.361]  4.
[02:35:09.062 --> 02:35:18.689]  Redefine terrorism in broad new terms that include members of firearms rights and anti-abortion groups or other such groups as determined by whoever is in power.
[02:35:19.470 --> 02:35:18.689]  5.
[02:35:20.010 --> 02:35:30.418]  Authorize the Secretary of Defense of Homeland Security to unilaterally expand the information included in the driver's license including such biometric information as retina scans and DNA information.
[02:35:31.219 --> 02:35:36.322]  Right.
[02:35:36.943 --> 02:35:47.510]  Well, what it all boils down to is, no matter what anybody says, the effect of all of this is to make it a lot easier for the government to know where you are, where you're going, where you've been.
[02:35:48.090 --> 02:35:53.915]  And you have to step back and ask yourself, apart from the rhetoric, and look at the reality, is this a good thing or a bad thing?
[02:35:53.955 --> 02:35:55.776]  And I think anybody who cares about freedom agrees
[02:35:56.734 --> 02:35:59.978]  It's a very bad thing, and it's the hallmark.
[02:36:00.359 --> 02:36:04.244]  Domestic travel restrictions are a hallmark of authoritarianism.
[02:36:04.664 --> 02:36:08.969]  You find that historically in authoritarian countries, not quote-unquote free ones.
[02:36:10.451 --> 02:36:13.415]  Well, it's a hallmark of serious despotism.
[02:36:14.076 --> 02:36:14.576]  Absolutely.
[02:36:14.937 --> 02:36:15.417]  Absolutely.
[02:36:15.497 --> 02:36:30.965]  And it's, once again, it's Congress cowering to an administration and giving all sorts of power to the Homeland Security Secretary to do whatever he thinks is best at the time without the requirement that any new laws be passed.
[02:36:30.985 --> 02:36:39.510]  So that's the kind of thing my boss is always afraid of, that Congress should never give this open-ended, unilateral power to administrative agencies.
[02:36:39.950 --> 02:36:44.315]  Like Homeland Security to make decisions that Congress doesn't even vote on, doesn't even approve one way or the other.
[02:36:44.635 --> 02:36:51.663]  I mean, you know, for all those Republican types out there, just remember, you know, that Republicans won't be in charge of the administration forever.
[02:36:52.168 --> 02:36:56.029]  You know, Hillary might be President in 08, and she can name whoever she wants as Homeland Security.
[02:36:56.269 --> 02:36:57.689]  Or Lord Schwarzenegger.
[02:36:57.969 --> 02:37:00.490]  Absolutely.
[02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:04.610]  People who think that they're going to be in power forever in Washington have very short memories.
[02:37:04.770 --> 02:37:12.072]  Yeah, so even if folks are delusional and think Bush is this wonderful conservative, we're building mechanisms that are a dream for Socialist Democrats.
[02:37:12.412 --> 02:37:18.853]  Unquestionably, and if anyone accuses you or anyone else of crying wolf or being alarmist on this,
[02:37:20.178 --> 02:37:25.360]  You know what, it's a lot better to be Crying Wolf than to be proven 10 or 20 or 30 years later that you were right.
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:33.502]  But I mean, forget 10 or 20 years with the TSA, which this system's going to go into buses and cars and all other types of licenses and jobs.
[02:37:34.282 --> 02:37:45.106]  I've got Ridge on videotape saying it's going to be just like the airplanes, and if you've got some bad data out of these hundreds and now they're saying thousands of different databases, a lot of it corrupted, you're not going to be able to have a job!
[02:37:45.166 --> 02:37:46.466]  I mean, this is total control!
[02:37:47.500 --> 02:37:48.001]  Absolutely.
[02:37:48.362 --> 02:37:48.763]  Absolutely.
[02:37:48.783 --> 02:37:51.730]  And it all takes place within the coming two years.
[02:37:51.971 --> 02:37:54.176]  States have two years to quote unquote conform.
[02:37:55.131 --> 02:38:05.194]  And while you'd think that in any sort of free country, states would be clamoring and very defiant about this federal mandate, this federal authority over them.
[02:38:05.514 --> 02:38:08.795]  States ought to be saying, hey, we set the standards for diversification, that's none of your business.
[02:38:08.815 --> 02:38:10.976]  But most states have put this in a decade ago.
[02:38:10.996 --> 02:38:13.757]  I mean, most states already have this.
[02:38:13.837 --> 02:38:22.620]  Now, what about this Pan-American Union situation, starting with Canada and Mexico, unifying the database there?
[02:38:23.240 --> 02:38:26.761]  And then on top of it is this comment out of the bill about DNA information.
[02:38:27.201 --> 02:38:27.401]  Right.
[02:38:27.441 --> 02:38:34.322]  Well, the Pan-American aspect is, you know, it's supposed to be a North American homeland security device.
[02:38:34.382 --> 02:38:38.963]  And what it could mean is, you know, that information goes to Mexican government officials.
[02:38:39.003 --> 02:38:41.964]  And as my colleague pointed out, imagine how corrupt some of them could be.
[02:38:42.004 --> 02:38:45.025]  And imagine how they could sell that to identity thieves.
[02:38:45.085 --> 02:38:46.905]  I mean, let's say you're social, you're addressed.
[02:38:47.341 --> 02:38:50.525]  You know, your birth dates, your birth records, all that sort of stuff.
[02:38:50.545 --> 02:38:52.427]  Well, the Mexican government isn't corrupt.
[02:38:53.448 --> 02:38:59.014]  I mean, here we are giving Homeland Security information to the very government that is most responsible for our Homeland Security problem.
[02:38:59.094 --> 02:39:01.957]  A narcotic kleptocracy.
[02:39:02.257 --> 02:39:06.942]  Sure, they encourage people to break our laws and come here illegally.
[02:39:06.962 --> 02:39:07.503]  They encourage it.
[02:39:07.543 --> 02:39:08.084]  They promote it.
[02:39:08.104 --> 02:39:09.385]  They put out manuals.
[02:39:10.234 --> 02:39:14.097]  Sure, so they're the last people on Earth we ought to be sharing our sensitive information with.
[02:39:14.317 --> 02:39:17.158]  When we talked to you this morning, you were saying we might be able to stop it.
[02:39:17.419 --> 02:39:21.201]  Now you're saying it looks like it's going to sail through the House, so the battle's going to be in the Senate.
[02:39:21.221 --> 02:39:21.641]  What do we do?
[02:39:21.881 --> 02:39:29.586]  Well, I shouldn't say sail through, but I don't think there's enough Democrats and philosophical Republicans to defeat this in the House.
[02:39:29.666 --> 02:39:36.811]  But the number one thing to do is give your Senators an earful and tell them that you don't want to be tracked and monitored.
[02:39:38.433 --> 02:39:44.255]  Well, on top of it, Ron Paul here in his analysis says it doesn't do anything to stop the illegals, but it's being billed as that.
[02:39:45.155 --> 02:39:47.956]  Right, and that's unfortunately the way things work up here.
[02:39:47.996 --> 02:39:52.678]  Things are often the opposite of what they appear, or what they seem, or how they're touted.
[02:39:53.278 --> 02:39:54.979]  But, you know, it's incumbent on all of us.
[02:39:55.019 --> 02:40:03.182]  I mean, sure, it's a tough road, but it's incumbent on all of us to call a spade a spade, and to the extent we can, shine a spotlight on these people who vote for it.
[02:40:04.582 --> 02:40:13.506]  It's amazing, I mean, the new Freedom Initiative, I mean, we know they passed it last year, now the Congressman in your office is fighting the funding of that.
[02:40:13.826 --> 02:40:14.866]  How's that going?
[02:40:14.926 --> 02:40:16.507]  We're getting some steam on that.
[02:40:16.567 --> 02:40:22.810]  We're actually pretty happy because a lot of mainstream Republicans actually joined us, have joined us in our efforts.
[02:40:23.570 --> 02:40:46.537]  Some of the states where these nascent state programs have been created, most notably Texas and Illinois, we've been able to get a lot of members of Congress from both those states, including people like DeLay and Hastert, who are obviously big names, to join us in coming out against the program, because if you talk to parents in states where these programs exist already, they hate it, and they make their congressmen aware of that.
[02:40:47.170 --> 02:40:56.143]  That's a fight where we've really gotten out ahead of the curve and for once we're fighting the creation of something rather than trying to get rid of something that's already created.
[02:40:58.166 --> 02:40:59.026]  Take new freedom.
[02:40:59.166 --> 02:41:10.271]  I mean, imagine if Bill Clinton said, we're going to forcibly, psychologically test everybody from age 4 to 18, and then second phase, all pregnant women, with guidelines written by the drug companies.
[02:41:10.631 --> 02:41:12.012]  Conservatives would pull their hair out.
[02:41:12.412 --> 02:41:13.092]  Bush doesn't.
[02:41:13.112 --> 02:41:14.453]  The neocons won't talk about it.
[02:41:14.653 --> 02:41:21.356]  They say it's good, unless you're a G. Gordon Liddy, who, God bless him, came out against it, and then they told him, hey, your radio show's gone.
[02:41:22.799 --> 02:41:25.920]  Well, that's why partisanship is just an aftermath of freedom.
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:27.361]  You know, there's no other way to say it.
[02:41:27.401 --> 02:41:38.286]  If people don't have the simple integrity to see through what, you know, supposedly their guys are doing as opposed to the other side's guys, then that might go a long way to explaining the mess we're in.
[02:41:39.906 --> 02:41:42.527]  Jeff, look, everybody I talk to is saying it.
[02:41:42.607 --> 02:41:45.388]  How do we get Ron Paul to run for governor in Texas?
[02:41:47.309 --> 02:41:48.390]  Ah, gee, that's a tough one.
[02:41:48.430 --> 02:41:51.191]  I guess the first thing's first, you help him raise about 30 million bucks.
[02:41:52.106 --> 02:41:53.127]  That's the reality.
[02:41:53.167 --> 02:41:55.429]  But he's so wildly popular.
[02:41:55.630 --> 02:41:57.331]  He's so wildly popular, though.
[02:41:57.692 --> 02:42:06.881]  Well, you know, Hutchinson may enter that race, and Bonilla has stated that if he does, he's going to run for Senate.
[02:42:06.901 --> 02:42:14.908]  There's a lot of people asking Ron also to consider that Republican Senate primary, but he's done a lot of campaigning in his day.
[02:42:17.000 --> 02:42:21.864]  Well, I mean, he can keep the House position and then run for the Senate race while keeping it.
[02:42:21.884 --> 02:42:24.767]  If he doesn't get it, he could stay in the House.
[02:42:24.807 --> 02:42:28.110]  He could run for Governor and keep the House seat, couldn't he?
[02:42:28.150 --> 02:42:29.571]  You sound like me talking to him.
[02:42:31.773 --> 02:42:34.976]  Everyone in this office wants him to run for anything he wants to.
[02:42:36.257 --> 02:42:36.978]  Well, why not?
[02:42:37.018 --> 02:42:38.639]  At least it gives him a bigger platform.
[02:42:40.200 --> 02:42:43.283]  Yeah, well, I guess just keep asking him.
[02:42:43.323 --> 02:42:44.064]  That's all I can say.
[02:42:44.750 --> 02:43:11.221]  Well, I mean, I think the governorship, I mean, the Senate would be a big deal, too, because you could really block things and bring things up in the Senate, but, I mean, just, and obviously a governor doesn't have a lot of power in Texas, the lieutenant governor really hasn't, but as a figurehead, he could, I mean, Ron Paul could do so much in the second most populous state economically, the second most powerful as well, I mean, he could do a lot here and then use that governorship as a platform for something larger!
[02:43:12.478 --> 02:43:13.318]  Well, absolutely.
[02:43:13.779 --> 02:43:14.219]  Absolutely.
[02:43:14.759 --> 02:43:15.479]  It's a good idea.
[02:43:15.499 --> 02:43:18.261]  All I can say is that stuff is up to him.
[02:43:19.822 --> 02:43:21.883]  So, any tips on twisting his arm?
[02:43:21.903 --> 02:43:30.547]  You'll have to send him an email, rep.paul at mail.house.gov.
[02:43:30.927 --> 02:43:33.188]  And give us Ron Paul's different websites.
[02:43:34.449 --> 02:43:39.231]  www.house.gov slash paul
[02:43:40.300 --> 02:43:43.784]  And www.TheLibertyCommittee.org.
[02:44:00.484 --> 02:44:06.408]  How do we fight these national toll roads that the feds are manipulating the states to put in?
[02:44:06.448 --> 02:44:11.352]  And of course, you know, the nightmare in Houston and Austin and all the corruption there with the toll roads.
[02:44:11.792 --> 02:44:14.594]  Any comments from Washington on that?
[02:44:15.314 --> 02:44:18.296]  Well, the number one battle is to
[02:44:20.187 --> 02:44:24.029]  You know, prevent this idea that all road funding has to be federal.
[02:44:24.170 --> 02:44:33.495]  You know, states have long ago just sort of shrugged their shoulders and relinquished control to the feds when it comes to road money and they're all addicted to this transportation money.
[02:44:33.535 --> 02:44:34.415]  And it's not free money!
[02:44:34.435 --> 02:44:36.517]  We send a dollar to them and thirty cents comes back.
[02:44:36.677 --> 02:44:42.800]  Absolutely, and especially a state like Texas that's upside down on the equation, unlike, you know, a welfare client like D.C.
[02:44:42.840 --> 02:44:44.041]  that gets a lot more than it pays.
[02:44:45.198 --> 02:45:04.990]  So, you know, you've got to reject the governmental solutions and start promoting things like private roads and private property and don't let governments just feel like they can pave a big swath from Mexico to Canada across our country.
[02:45:05.872 --> 02:45:06.533]  Last question.
[02:45:06.613 --> 02:45:09.295]  The congressman said we were going to fail in Iraq.
[02:45:09.455 --> 02:45:12.598]  He said that a year and a half ago in a speech he gave here in Austin.
[02:45:12.978 --> 02:45:14.479]  It's in my film, The Matrix of Evil.
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:18.082]  He laid out what was going to happen and now it's happening.
[02:45:18.282 --> 02:45:19.363]  What do you see happening in Iraq?
[02:45:19.383 --> 02:45:20.424]  What's the congressman saying?
[02:45:21.284 --> 02:45:24.347]  Well, he thinks we should get out now.
[02:45:24.847 --> 02:45:28.370]  Everyone wants to say, well now we can't get out because there would be civil war and blah blah blah.
[02:45:28.650 --> 02:45:29.451]  He disagrees with that.
[02:45:29.471 --> 02:45:30.592]  He says we've done enough harm.
[02:45:31.523 --> 02:45:33.365]  There is a civil war!
[02:45:34.086 --> 02:45:39.971]  Absolutely, and if it was a mistake to go in, then it's also a mistake to stay in.
[02:45:41.032 --> 02:45:47.259]  So he would like to see authority turned over to whoever's going to end up governing there.
[02:45:47.339 --> 02:45:51.222]  It's not the United States' place to occupy or run Iraq.
[02:45:54.642 --> 02:46:00.324]  In the final equation, HR 418, still call your House members, but go ahead and start calling the Senate.
[02:46:00.364 --> 02:46:03.965]  We don't have an opinion companion bill number yet, but it's going to the Senate.
[02:46:04.185 --> 02:46:07.466]  We could defeat this beefing up of the national ID card there.
[02:46:07.726 --> 02:46:17.309]  And the final vote on the House side on this bill will likely not be until tomorrow, so there's still some time to make a phone call to your House people.
[02:46:18.416 --> 02:46:20.397]  Because then at least they know we're watching them.
[02:46:20.437 --> 02:46:21.378]  Right, absolutely.
[02:46:21.578 --> 02:46:24.200]  Alright, Jeff Dice, thanks a million for coming on.
[02:46:24.240 --> 02:46:26.281]  I want to get the Congressman on in the near future.
[02:46:26.301 --> 02:46:26.762]  Sure, you bet.
[02:46:26.802 --> 02:46:27.322]  Thanks a million.
[02:46:27.462 --> 02:46:27.922]  God bless.
[02:46:28.943 --> 02:46:30.804]  Alright, there goes Jeff Dice, folks.
[02:46:30.824 --> 02:46:32.085]  Just a great guy.
[02:46:32.285 --> 02:46:37.389]  He is just working tirelessly with the Congressman to fight all of this.
[02:46:38.149 --> 02:46:39.390]  Speaking of Matrix of Evil,
[02:46:40.347 --> 02:46:54.877]  That's a two-hour video, and about 30 minutes of it is different, an interview I did with Ron Paul, parts of a speech he gave where he says those that want to build world government run Washington, where he talks about what's happening with the economy, where he gets into the Iraq War.
[02:46:54.917 --> 02:46:59.260]  This is a real conservative, most conservative voting record, where he breaks down all the facts.
[02:46:59.300 --> 02:47:08.266]  And then it's Colonel Craig Roberts, myself, Frank Morales, just so many other experts on the New World Order and the police state.
[02:47:08.546 --> 02:47:09.427]  It's a great video.
[02:47:10.840 --> 02:47:16.949]  $25.95.
[02:47:10.901 --> 02:47:16.949]  But if you buy one copy of that and two other videos, they all drop down to $19.95.
[02:47:16.989 --> 02:47:17.650]  That's an $18 discount!
[02:47:21.067 --> 02:47:22.608]  So get 9-11 The Road to Tyranny.
[02:47:23.029 --> 02:47:24.190]  Get The Masters of Terror.
[02:47:24.230 --> 02:47:25.931]  Get Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:47:26.332 --> 02:47:27.252]  Get Matrix of Evil.
[02:47:27.292 --> 02:47:27.993]  Get these videos.
[02:47:28.013 --> 02:47:33.538]  And I've got a 9-11 special where you get four 9-11 films and a full length 300 plus page book.
[02:47:33.938 --> 02:47:37.501]  So nine plus hours of video and a 300 plus page book for $59.95.
[02:47:38.121 --> 02:47:40.564]  You can give it as gifts and wake folks up.
[02:47:40.884 --> 02:47:44.547]  And I got deals where you buy one Road to Tyranny for $24.95.
[02:47:44.587 --> 02:47:45.568]  Almost three hours long.
[02:47:45.608 --> 02:47:46.749]  The preeminent 9-11 film.
[02:47:47.049 --> 02:47:47.950]  Each additional copy $5.95.
[02:47:50.080 --> 02:47:54.461]  And your purchase also makes this show possible, folks, and we do need your support.

[02:51:46.344 --> 02:51:51.888]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.702 --> 02:51:57.083]  Oh, one more little comment on the videos.
[02:51:57.143 --> 02:52:03.227]  We have George Humphrey's excellent two-hour 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[02:52:03.287 --> 02:52:04.487]  It's a wonderful video.
[02:52:05.308 --> 02:52:13.532]  The same editor that helped me make Matrix of Evil and Police State, Three Total Enslavement, the quality of those, helped George make this film.
[02:52:14.172 --> 02:52:16.013]  And it's just excellent.
[02:52:16.273 --> 02:52:17.494]  $19.95 for that.
[02:52:17.554 --> 02:52:19.435]  And then you get three copies.
[02:52:20.997 --> 02:52:25.603]  Well, you get one copy of the 85-page color booklet, the accompanying booklet.
[02:52:25.703 --> 02:52:33.193]  With that, when you get a second copy, I forget, I think it's like $9.95 for a second copy, then you get three of the color booklets.
[02:52:33.594 --> 02:52:37.499]  There's a special on that as well, an Eric Huffman video.
[02:52:39.144 --> 02:52:40.845]  9-11 Painful Deceptions.
[02:52:41.325 --> 02:52:42.766]  We have that as well.
[02:52:42.866 --> 02:52:49.028]  So go to InfoWars.com or call 888-253-3139 to get those.
[02:52:49.328 --> 02:52:51.909]  I mean, we need you to get the films and get them out to people.
[02:52:51.969 --> 02:52:53.009]  Make copies of my films.
[02:52:53.289 --> 02:52:54.310]  Put them on Axios TV.
[02:52:54.390 --> 02:52:55.090]  Educate others.
[02:52:55.810 --> 02:52:59.472]  I mean, folks, we're facing serious tyranny already.
[02:52:59.492 --> 02:53:01.793]  And it's just going to get worse until we expose who the terrorists are.
[02:53:02.233 --> 02:53:03.093]  And it's already happening.
[02:53:03.113 --> 02:53:05.614]  People all over are realizing what's happening.
[02:53:06.221 --> 02:53:12.167]  You heard the former top CIA analyst saying the government's probably going to be behind a terror attack in America in the last hour.
[02:53:12.667 --> 02:53:18.773]  I mean, people are finally starting to come out of the woodwork and come out of the shadows to expose this.
[02:53:19.754 --> 02:53:22.697]  Alright, I'm sure you know that a car bomb exploded in Madrid.
[02:53:22.717 --> 02:53:26.801]  A car bomb has exploded here in the Madrid Conference Center, injuring at least 31 people.
[02:53:27.442 --> 02:53:29.684]  We covered this in the first hour, but it's important to recap it.
[02:53:30.498 --> 02:53:36.800]  Before a royal visit, Spanish police say a caller claimed to be from the Basque militants.
[02:53:38.420 --> 02:53:42.921]  ETA told a newspaper the group was planning to explode a device in the city.
[02:53:43.501 --> 02:53:49.823]  The blast occurred at 8.30 GMT near the Juan Carlos Convention Center.
[02:53:50.600 --> 02:54:01.663]  So about three in the morning here, on the proposed venues for Madrid's 2012 Olympic bid, Spanish King Juan Carlos and Queen Sophie have been due to visit the center.
[02:54:04.244 --> 02:54:16.267]  This continual tribal warfare going on between the Basque and the Spanish, just like we got tribal warfare between the Palestinians and Israelis, it's never going to stop, no matter what we do.
[02:54:18.016 --> 02:54:20.917]  I guess until one group just disappears.
[02:54:22.078 --> 02:54:27.639]  World Cup 2006 abuse for mega surveillance project is out of the register.
[02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:37.623]  Germany's football authorities have been accused of big brother tactics over their decision to incorporate RFID chips into tickets for World Cup 2006.
[02:54:39.102 --> 02:54:44.644]  Around 3.7 million tickets are to be sold in four online sales rounds, the last of 15 April 2006.
[02:54:45.164 --> 02:54:52.247]  In the first sales around 160,000 fans applied for 1 million tickets covering all 64 matches.
[02:54:52.807 --> 02:54:59.629]  To apply for a ticket you have to give your name, address, nationality, which team you want to support, and your bank details.
[02:54:59.749 --> 02:55:03.531]  You must also supply your ID or passport number and your birthday.
[02:55:04.031 --> 02:55:04.251]  Wow!
[02:55:04.998 --> 02:55:12.882]  Assuming you're successful, you receive a fully personalized ticket containing your RFID chip that enables authorities to check the ticket against your passport.
[02:55:13.623 --> 02:55:15.544]  Very little identification resides on the chip.
[02:55:15.564 --> 02:55:20.386]  The identity check is conducted against a database of the German Football Association.
[02:55:21.567 --> 02:55:23.127]  And that's going to be life here in America.
[02:55:23.147 --> 02:55:28.650]  You try to go to Disney World or Sea World, they hand scan you all over the country.
[02:55:29.771 --> 02:55:31.752]  But the borders are wide open.
[02:55:33.286 --> 02:55:38.430]  Interesting article here out of USA Today, how Hollywood is propagandizing for the military and the police state.
[02:55:38.951 --> 02:55:40.112]  You might want to go read that.
[02:55:40.952 --> 02:55:46.357]  And Bush said, it's uniquely American to hold three jobs and it's good that more Americans are having to work three jobs.
[02:55:46.837 --> 02:55:52.442]  Yeah, it's good that people can't raise their children if the state and the television can't do that.
[02:55:53.322 --> 02:55:58.166]  Very, very dangerous trend that we're facing.
[02:55:58.827 --> 02:56:02.750]  A fifth state is on the verge of passing a law to limit Patriot Act.
[02:56:04.441 --> 02:56:05.782]  And that's Arizona.
[02:56:06.362 --> 02:56:11.084]  An unusual alliance of conservatives and liberal state lawmakers wants Congress to limit the federal government's eavesdropping.
[02:56:11.104 --> 02:56:13.185]  And if they don't do it, the state may do it.
[02:56:14.366 --> 02:56:16.547]  We are flat out of time.
[02:56:16.587 --> 02:56:19.708]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:56:20.188 --> 02:56:23.030]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[02:56:23.510 --> 02:56:25.371]  And we'll always be checking you out.
[02:56:26.794 --> 02:56:27.917]  Fight the New World Order.
[02:56:27.957 --> 02:56:32.850]  You can always go check out what we're doing at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:56:32.871 --> 02:56:33.793]  So join us in the fight.
[02:56:33.813 --> 02:56:34.194]  God bless.
