[00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:06.165]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.846 --> 00:00:07.907]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.627 --> 00:00:09.748]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.368 --> 00:00:11.209]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:13.470]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.173]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.713 --> 00:00:21.796]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.468 --> 00:00:40.828]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.868 --> 00:00:44.409]  It's already Wednesday, the 25th day of May 2005.
[00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.950]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:59.933]  Joining us on average about every week and a half, we have Paul Joseph Watson coming on for the second half of the broadcast with his great news updates as we blitz through hundreds of different news reports.
[00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.432]  I'm going to go to your calls early in the next segment.
[00:01:04.532 --> 00:01:09.335]  Any news item, any piece of information, any story you wish to cover.
[00:01:11.016 --> 00:01:12.537]  Wide open phones.
[00:01:12.557 --> 00:01:15.559]  We want to talk about the new Patriot Act, the radical expansion.
[00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.402]  New developments coming out with the Super National ID cards.
[00:01:19.442 --> 00:01:20.763]  What's happening with our borders.
[00:01:21.343 --> 00:01:22.364]  The Second Amendment.
[00:01:22.404 --> 00:01:23.845]  Genetically modified foods.
[00:01:23.985 --> 00:01:26.947]  All the new information coming out on that.
[00:01:28.114 --> 00:01:28.174]  1-800-259-9231
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.321]  And I love the direction that callers take us, all the different issues and items they bring up.
[00:02:03.361 --> 00:02:10.804]  In fact, a lot of news that I meant to get to in days past and didn't, listeners bring up, or news that I missed, they mention 1-800-259-9231.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.622]  The websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, freshly updated daily for you.
[00:02:21.302 --> 00:02:28.866]  Anti-illegal activists threatened Hispanic groups suggest food workers might taint food at Vegas Summit.
[00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:43.113]  And other groups have called for illegal stalking and basic terrorist acts against the Minutemen, who are simply there on the border calling the Border Patrol when they see drug dealers and smugglers of every ilk pouring across.
[00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:45.079]  Bush says that's bad.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.380]  Evil vigilantes.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.001]  Cattle on your neighbors.
[00:02:48.181 --> 00:02:49.241]  Spy on your neighbors.
[00:02:49.881 --> 00:02:52.402]  Give your children to the government to teach them how to be spies.
[00:02:52.722 --> 00:02:57.784]  But don't call the Border Patrol or you're bad.
[00:02:57.904 --> 00:02:58.164]  1,000 U.S.
[00:02:58.184 --> 00:03:00.265]  troops launch offensive in Iraq.
[00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:05.007]  Al-Zawahiri reportedly evacuated from Iraq wounded.
[00:03:05.027 --> 00:03:09.589]  We have a news flashback where he's been killed, wounded, captured.
[00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.210]  And the media never retracts their previous statements on that.
[00:03:14.292 --> 00:03:17.693]  A listener called about this yesterday, and they did email it to me, and I appreciate it.
[00:03:17.713 --> 00:03:19.893]  The link is jfcom.mil.
[00:03:21.314 --> 00:03:21.694]  U.S.
[00:03:21.954 --> 00:03:23.674]  Joint Forces Command and U.S.
[00:03:23.694 --> 00:03:26.675]  Marine Corps co-sponsor Joint Urban Warrior 05.
[00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.856]  I've been to several urban warriors.
[00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:34.897]  And they openly train with the local police and others to put Americans in FEMA camps.
[00:03:34.957 --> 00:03:37.398]  This time it's going to be up in Maryland.
[00:03:37.458 --> 00:03:39.858]  So I want to go over some of their press release.
[00:03:40.438 --> 00:03:43.039]  The Die Conspiracy Theory Reviewed.
[00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.770]  This is from CBS News.
[00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:57.518]  I mean, it's not really a conspiracy theory when she wrote letters and did videotaped records, diaries, that Charles had said, I'm going to kill you, and it's going to look like a car accident.
[00:03:57.838 --> 00:04:06.364]  And then she dies a few months later, and there's all the foul play swirling around it, and you're an evil conspiracy theorist if you talk about it.
[00:04:06.844 --> 00:04:07.645]  Certainly not.
[00:04:07.845 --> 00:04:11.227]  Royals never have their families killed.
[00:04:11.447 --> 00:04:12.568]  Never in history.
[00:04:13.138 --> 00:04:14.658]  It's ridiculous!
[00:04:15.278 --> 00:04:21.820]  Of course, that's all royals seem to ever do throughout history, but let's just ignore the facts and call it a conspiracy theory.
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.601]  It'd be like if I got up on air and said, this person has said they're going to kill me!
[00:04:26.661 --> 00:04:34.663]  And then I die in that exact fashion, and there's foul play evidence everywhere, and people just go, oh, well, you know, it's kind of like Gary Webb.
[00:04:34.963 --> 00:04:36.463]  He shot himself twice in the head.
[00:04:36.523 --> 00:04:37.763]  It's actually quite normal.
[00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:40.724]  This happens all the time, yeah, in Arkansas.
[00:04:42.535 --> 00:04:49.301]  He blew his jaw and teeth out, something that would knock anyone out and kill most people, and then supposedly shot himself again.
[00:04:49.901 --> 00:04:56.507]  And I, again, am a Rumpelstiltskin Easter Bunny from the 12th dimension hopscotching my way to Valhalla.
[00:04:57.048 --> 00:04:57.848]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.868 --> 00:04:58.309]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.135 --> 00:05:05.458]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.658 --> 00:05:10.081]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.221 --> 00:05:14.604]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.644 --> 00:05:16.005]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.786 --> 00:05:21.989]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.049 --> 00:05:28.994]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.114 --> 00:05:31.116]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.496 --> 00:05:41.944]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.124 --> 00:05:47.529]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:07:41.238 --> 00:07:41.619]  Death?
[00:07:41.739 --> 00:07:43.541]  Don't take unnecessary risks.

[00:07:51.331 --> 00:07:51.832]  Call now.
[00:08:02.344 --> 00:08:08.387]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.987 --> 00:08:12.028]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:18.071]  All right, Paul Watson will be joining us with his weekly news update.
[00:08:18.091 --> 00:08:24.154]  In the middle of the next hour, the second half of this transmission, Worldwide Against Tyranny.
[00:08:25.583 --> 00:08:38.773]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast today, and in the first hour and a half, I'm going to accelerate through your calls, so have your question, your comment, your point ready, because I'm going to move on to the next person, so everybody gets a chance to get involved on air.
[00:08:39.173 --> 00:08:40.994]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:41.014 --> 00:08:52.383]  Anti-illegal activists threatened Hispanic groups suggest food workers might take food at Vegas summits.
[00:08:53.994 --> 00:09:12.631]  A radical anti-American group working for the establishment of a separate Hispanic nation in the Southwest has threatened attendees of an anti-immigration conference in Las Vegas planned for this week, saying Mexican food workers might cause Montezuma's revenge among those they serve.
[00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:16.995]  Now, the threat of a violent action...
[00:09:18.169 --> 00:09:24.692]  Or a threat that is not even intended to be carried out is the very definition of terrorism.
[00:09:24.712 --> 00:09:28.994]  And that's the only thing I agree with in the first Patriot Act.
[00:09:29.634 --> 00:09:31.495]  Because it just recodifies that.
[00:09:32.876 --> 00:09:35.477]  Yes, even a blind hog occasionally finds an acorn.
[00:09:36.297 --> 00:09:39.799]  Broken clocks are right twice a day, so on and so forth.
[00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:42.400]  If you go into a theater and yell, FIRE!
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:42.940]  FIRE!
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:43.720]  GET OUT OF HERE!
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.081]  RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!
[00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:54.346]  That is something you'll go to jail for, and you should, because people will be trampled, and people might die, and people will have compound fractures as they're stomped on.
[00:09:55.926 --> 00:09:58.047]  Pregnant women will be stomped on and have miscarriages.
[00:09:58.087 --> 00:09:59.588]  That's one of the famous cases.
[00:10:01.849 --> 00:10:02.810]  And so you can't do that.
[00:10:02.850 --> 00:10:05.731]  But our White House constantly issues fake terror alerts.
[00:10:05.771 --> 00:10:09.453]  It's totally admitted for political aims, and they never get in trouble for it.
[00:10:10.373 --> 00:10:11.834]  Governments do it all over the world.
[00:10:12.679 --> 00:10:20.485]  You're going, what does this have to do with anti-illegal activists threatened Hispanic groups of just food workers might take food at Vegas Summit?
[00:10:21.986 --> 00:10:23.127]  This is from World Net Daily.
[00:10:24.668 --> 00:10:27.970]  What does that have to do with false terror threats?
[00:10:28.751 --> 00:10:37.277]  Regardless of whether this threat is real or not, it's having the attempted effect to intimidate people to not engage in their First Amendment political rights.
[00:10:39.443 --> 00:10:43.924]  To meet and to petition and to formulate ideas.
[00:10:46.245 --> 00:10:46.905]  Formulize.
[00:10:46.965 --> 00:10:47.905]  I'm inventing new words.
[00:10:47.965 --> 00:10:48.905]  I should say formulate.
[00:10:51.686 --> 00:10:52.706]  And they're not going to get in trouble.
[00:10:52.726 --> 00:10:53.146]  They should.
[00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:59.468]  There's another website out there that was calling for people to go out there and have confrontations with the Minutemen and to do all sorts of other things.
[00:10:59.508 --> 00:11:03.309]  And since then they've gotten in trouble somewhat, so they're backing off those original statements.
[00:11:04.229 --> 00:11:07.610]  But I have found these groups to be extremely vicious, extremely hateful.
[00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:24.683]  A news release from La Vase de Aslan, which sees its struggle for a separate state with Los Angeles as its capital, as similar to that of the Palestinians in the Middle East, announces that leaders of the U.S.
[00:11:24.883 --> 00:11:31.489]  anti-Mexican movement, Aslan, own term, will be meeting this weekend in Las Vegas.
[00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:51.743]  And the group states that the who's who list of xenophobes will be at the Plaza Hotel on Friday, May 27th, Saturday 28th, and Sunday 29th to coordinate the vigilante operations they plan to undertake along the California-Mexico border on June through August.
[00:11:52.564 --> 00:11:59.169]  The mention of vigilante operations as a reference to the activities of the Minutemen Project, a successful citizen border control effort,
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:06.322]  That effectively shut down the flow of illegal aliens across Mexico's border with Arizona on a 23-mile stretch.
[00:12:07.323 --> 00:12:14.265]  Among the races who will be attending is the head bigot Tom Tancredo, says Lavaz de Aslan.
[00:12:14.305 --> 00:12:18.387]  Tom Tancredo is a congressman from Colorado who has aspirations to become U.S.
[00:12:18.447 --> 00:12:23.869]  president by utilizing Mexican immigrants as scapegoats for the nation's economic and social problems.
[00:12:24.649 --> 00:12:26.990]  Well, it's not all your fault, but it's a great deal of it is.
[00:12:27.711 --> 00:12:36.575]  Among other bigots attending are felon Chris Simcox of the Minutemen Vigilantes and his lackey Jim Gilchrist.
[00:12:37.355 --> 00:12:53.242]  The list of anti-Mexican xenophobes also includes Glenn Spencer of American Patrol, Barbara Cole of California Coalition for Immigration Reform, all these people are heroes, and the coconut Andy Ramirez, friends of the Border Patrol.
[00:12:55.066 --> 00:13:01.310]  Andy Ramirez is being utilized by the bigots as a taco teal, whatever that means.
[00:13:01.831 --> 00:13:05.073]  The event is being sponsored by the Wake Up America Foundation.
[00:13:05.373 --> 00:13:11.157]  The true name of the conference, according to the event website, is United to Fight Against Illegal Immigration Summit.
[00:13:13.118 --> 00:13:18.222]  And then they go on to call for hotel workers to poison the food.
[00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.511]  And I'll read more of this later.
[00:13:21.531 --> 00:13:23.832]  I said I'd go to your call, so I will get more into this later.
[00:13:24.232 --> 00:13:36.200]  Something I never really covered properly yesterday, and I said I'd do it, was the situation with Pat Tillman and that propaganda, how he really died, similar to the Jessica Lynch fable.
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:41.683]  Also, the Christian Science Monitor, where the feds and local police are saying videotaping anything is illegal.
[00:13:41.723 --> 00:13:44.145]  There's no law against it, but they'll still arrest you.
[00:13:44.865 --> 00:13:46.766]  They love their cameras, but ours are bad.
[00:13:47.467 --> 00:13:49.228]  They play their games, we'll play ours.
[00:13:51.397 --> 00:13:52.557]  So I'll get into that as well.
[00:13:52.617 --> 00:13:55.098]  There's been some new bombings in Iraq and Madrid.
[00:13:55.118 --> 00:13:59.399]  And there's just so much here that I'll be going over.
[00:13:59.459 --> 00:14:04.580]  But understand, folks, that I have the Associated Press.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:18.062]  I have World Net Daily from two days ago, where in the past 50 years in this country, there would be just a handful, I mean less than 10, wet leprosy cases a year in this country.
[00:14:18.863 --> 00:14:20.503]  By the way, there's no cure for leprosy.
[00:14:21.641 --> 00:14:24.524]  And what leprosy is the type transmittable from human to human?
[00:14:26.686 --> 00:14:28.928]  Leprosy is not fun, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:29.349 --> 00:14:33.312]  For those that don't know what it does, it basically eats your body.
[00:14:33.773 --> 00:14:37.977]  It eats your capillaries and then your larger vessels and your fingers fall off.
[00:14:38.337 --> 00:14:39.418]  Your nose falls off.
[00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:41.520]  Your eyes rot out of their head.
[00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:42.982]  Your arms and legs rot off.
[00:14:43.743 --> 00:14:44.864]  It's not fun.
[00:14:45.464 --> 00:14:46.165]  Not fun at all.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:15:09.508]  And in the past, every other society in history would take lepers and would put them in their own little communities, normally on nice little woodland areas, or put them on little tropical islands, and there were foundations of different monks that would send them money and help build an area for them, and it would end up being happy little societies.
[00:15:09.588 --> 00:15:11.609]  But don't worry about that.
[00:15:11.789 --> 00:15:14.210]  Now, we just say, come on in!
[00:15:14.230 --> 00:15:17.251]  And they stick lepers right in the public schools.
[00:15:19.136 --> 00:15:19.657]  I'm not kidding.
[00:15:19.677 --> 00:15:30.124]  Just like they stick the people with drug-resistant, drug-immune TB in the schools, and you can read the health department warnings that are in their internal websites and in their internal publications that are public, but you never hear it in the news.
[00:15:30.665 --> 00:15:38.491]  As TB explodes, they're setting up what is the equivalent of modern sanitariums for the hundreds of thousands of people that now have it.
[00:15:39.211 --> 00:15:40.132]  Police are getting it.
[00:15:40.192 --> 00:15:41.193]  Firefighters are getting it.
[00:15:41.573 --> 00:15:43.014]  Social workers are getting it in mass.
[00:15:43.034 --> 00:15:43.935]  School teachers are getting it.
[00:15:44.335 --> 00:15:47.838]  In some cases, in public schools, half a class will get it.
[00:15:49.584 --> 00:15:51.525]  It is monstrous.
[00:15:52.226 --> 00:15:53.006]  It is unbelievable.
[00:15:53.767 --> 00:16:01.853]  And the open borders advocates in the federal government just say, absolutely no testing, medical testing, absolutely nothing, just come on in.
[00:16:03.435 --> 00:16:17.346]  And the lepers are pouring in predominantly from India, Indonesia, and areas of Central Asia, though some are coming in from Mexico, because the people from the East are coming into Mexico, and
[00:16:18.095 --> 00:16:19.916]  Taking over there, as well.
[00:16:20.877 --> 00:16:22.559]  And it's quite serious.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.604]  And every form of horrible third world disease, whooping cough, we're even getting cholera now.
[00:16:30.545 --> 00:16:33.547]  Open sewers run in Miami, chickens in the streets.
[00:16:34.668 --> 00:16:35.989]  It's just wonderful.
[00:16:36.849 --> 00:16:38.971]  And the media keeps it real quiet.
[00:16:39.311 --> 00:16:42.934]  But right now, 7,000 new cases a year of wet leprosy.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:51.745]  If you don't know what leprosy is, I suggest you type it into a medical search engine and look at photos of it.
[00:16:52.706 --> 00:16:55.789]  Your child gets leprosy, it's not going to be in the news.
[00:16:56.329 --> 00:17:02.334]  There's an unwritten rule to keep these darling little side effects of open borders quite quiet.
[00:17:03.375 --> 00:17:04.836]  All right, I'll go to your calls now.
[00:17:04.856 --> 00:17:08.980]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[00:17:11.101 --> 00:17:12.222]  Jeremy in Pennsylvania.
[00:17:12.242 --> 00:17:12.982]  Go ahead, Jeremy.
[00:17:13.323 --> 00:17:13.943]  Hey, Alex.
[00:17:14.203 --> 00:17:16.925]  I'm just going to fly through this quick so you can get back to your show.
[00:17:17.465 --> 00:17:19.527]  Fresh taser death in Pennsylvania.
[00:17:19.667 --> 00:17:20.427]  Sinking spring.
[00:17:20.467 --> 00:17:22.248]  The guy's name was Lee M. Kimmel.
[00:17:22.488 --> 00:17:24.050]  There's a daily taser death now.
[00:17:24.150 --> 00:17:32.095]  Yeah, well... A few months ago it was every other day, but now they're serving them out to all the police, so... There's something very interesting about it, though.
[00:17:32.135 --> 00:17:33.876]  My dad was watching the report on the news...
[00:17:34.557 --> 00:17:40.302]  They said that the guy was going to turn himself in for murder today, or actually I should say yesterday in the newspaper.
[00:17:40.342 --> 00:17:49.909]  They're trying to say that a guy who was suspected of murder was trying to bust into the municipal building, and that's when the cops found him, and they tasered him.
[00:17:50.009 --> 00:17:52.971]  He got up, started wrestling with him, they tased him again, and he died.
[00:17:53.732 --> 00:17:58.836]  I went to go get the transcript from the Channel 69 radio station, or TV station, and
[00:17:59.642 --> 00:18:00.223]  And guess what?
[00:18:00.283 --> 00:18:02.885]  Transcript has changed right the day afterwards.
[00:18:02.965 --> 00:18:04.146]  Good!
[00:18:04.206 --> 00:18:05.206]  Yeah, ooh, ain't that lovely?
[00:18:05.226 --> 00:18:08.349]  Can't even hide the evidence right away, why don't ya?
[00:18:08.369 --> 00:18:11.391]  So I'll let you get back to your show, but I just thought I'd let you know.
[00:18:11.431 --> 00:18:17.196]  If you want, I can send you that, but you got plenty of taser deaths, so you don't really need no... Well, we've almost become desensitized now.
[00:18:17.236 --> 00:18:18.617]  There is a daily taser death.
[00:18:18.957 --> 00:18:19.217]  Yeah.
[00:18:19.577 --> 00:18:21.739]  And it's normally an old lady or a young child.
[00:18:21.759 --> 00:18:22.960]  They're most susceptible, but...
[00:18:24.011 --> 00:18:25.412]  I make sure I get mad every time.
[00:18:25.713 --> 00:18:26.734]  I'm not going to get used to it.
[00:18:26.754 --> 00:18:27.194]  Screw that.
[00:18:27.214 --> 00:18:28.095]  It ain't going to tase me.
[00:18:28.395 --> 00:18:29.136]  Good, good.
[00:18:29.156 --> 00:18:30.237]  Appreciate your call.
[00:18:31.238 --> 00:18:33.119]  Let's talk to Anthony in Louisiana.
[00:18:33.179 --> 00:18:33.960]  Anthony, go ahead.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.181]  Hi.
[00:18:35.542 --> 00:18:35.982]  Hello, sir.
[00:18:36.562 --> 00:18:48.573]  Alex, I've heard you say before that in the McCarthy era of the 50s that he was partially, I'm talking about Senator Joe McCarthy was right in his accusations in certain ways.
[00:18:48.653 --> 00:18:48.934]  Yes.
[00:18:49.474 --> 00:18:50.395]  And if he was,
[00:18:51.058 --> 00:19:02.563]  Then why compare the McCarthyism era to the current Patriot Act era if Joe McCarthy actually... Well, I don't do that in the articles I've penned about the Patriot Act, too.
[00:19:03.344 --> 00:19:03.924]  Okay.
[00:19:04.744 --> 00:19:07.286]  Could you tell me in what ways Joe was right?
[00:19:08.326 --> 00:19:09.427]  And I'll just hang up and listen.
[00:19:09.447 --> 00:19:09.667]  Thanks.
[00:19:09.887 --> 00:19:10.627]  Well, thank you.
[00:19:11.207 --> 00:19:12.268]  I appreciate that call.
[00:19:12.308 --> 00:19:13.449]  It's a very important question.
[00:19:13.489 --> 00:19:16.470]  I mean, I could spend 20 minutes on this, but I'll just spend a few on it.
[00:19:18.453 --> 00:19:30.175]  Well, I mean, you've all seen the made-for-TV movies and the movies about it and all the hit pieces on him and hit pieces even written by people like, you know, Skull and Bones, a minion over at the little neocon publications.
[00:19:31.535 --> 00:19:36.016]  But he discovered that, quote, communism was being funded by the Pentagon and the Army.
[00:19:37.816 --> 00:19:47.258]  And it sounded insane to everyone, but now even the Wall Street Journal's published, the documents have gone public, the Soviet documents have gone public.
[00:19:48.306 --> 00:19:57.714]  I have been made public, and he broke through to the real paradigm, like George Arwell did, and that's when they destroyed him.
[00:19:57.875 --> 00:19:58.235]  Stay there.
[00:19:58.255 --> 00:20:00.637]  I'll talk about it when we get back.
[00:20:02.819 --> 00:20:03.380]  Hi, folks.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.161]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.481 --> 00:20:06.382]  The real money, folks.
[00:20:06.402 --> 00:20:06.943]  Thank you.
[00:20:09.773 --> 00:20:13.175]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:13.255 --> 00:20:15.116]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[00:20:15.716 --> 00:20:21.339]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:20:30.913 --> 00:20:31.573]  We're good to go.
[00:21:01.281 --> 00:21:04.563]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:04.603 --> 00:21:08.805]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:09.025 --> 00:21:11.826]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:12.006 --> 00:21:14.408]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:14.608 --> 00:21:23.252]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:23.432 --> 00:21:24.793]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:29.155]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:29.475 --> 00:21:29.996]  We're good to go.
[00:22:00.856 --> 00:22:05.458]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's Liquid Quell.
[00:22:05.698 --> 00:22:14.142]  Doctor-recommended, safe, effective, affordable cholesterol control, available now at major wholesale clubs everywhere, without a prescription.
[00:22:14.342 --> 00:22:16.383]  Here's Dr. Sherry Rainwater, MD.
[00:22:16.683 --> 00:22:19.804]  I recommend Quell to my patients because it's been shown to be effective.
[00:22:19.804 --> 00:22:21.905]  Effective and safe in reducing cholesterol.
[00:22:22.085 --> 00:22:28.389]  Quell is an easy way to improve your cholesterol profile without serious side effects in as little as six months, guaranteed.
[00:22:28.669 --> 00:22:32.891]  And Quell is safe for diabetics, gluten-free, and safe to take with prescriptions.
[00:22:33.111 --> 00:22:34.772]  Here's Cheryl Gee in California.
[00:22:34.992 --> 00:22:41.476]  Quell lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days, something I couldn't do with diet and exercise in two to three years.
[00:22:41.756 --> 00:22:48.318]  Gentle, fast-acting liquid quail is available at major wholesale clubs nationwide and online at quaildirect.com.
[00:22:48.458 --> 00:22:52.079]  Quail your cholesterol today, risk-free and guaranteed.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.400]  These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.701]  Quail is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[00:22:58.922 --> 00:23:00.102]  Individual results may vary.
[00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:03.802]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:04.502 --> 00:23:08.163]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:23:08.783 --> 00:23:12.664]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:23:13.364 --> 00:23:21.947]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:23:22.907 --> 00:23:30.069]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:23:31.022 --> 00:23:39.149]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:43.292]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:43.312 --> 00:23:43.572]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:43.592 --> 00:23:43.832]  Call now.
[00:23:43.852 --> 00:23:47.635]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:09.865 --> 00:24:21.690]  Joseph McCarthy from Appleton, Wisconsin was a very good patriotic man.
[00:24:24.291 --> 00:24:35.295]  He saw serious combat as a combat bomb assessment photographer in the bombers, in the bombing raids over Tokyo.
[00:24:36.663 --> 00:24:42.027]  He was there at air bases in the Pacific as they were leapfrogging from island to island.
[00:24:42.747 --> 00:24:44.648]  He was bombed and scraped many times.
[00:24:45.549 --> 00:24:46.970]  He really did hate communists.
[00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:48.371]  He really did love America.
[00:24:49.091 --> 00:24:58.257]  But he was not sophisticated enough, and who would have been, in hindsight, to understand what he was really facing?
[00:24:59.037 --> 00:25:01.499]  I mean, he was just a little middle-class chicken farmer who...
[00:25:04.972 --> 00:25:07.955]  Really didn't find out that there were communists taking over the government.
[00:25:09.296 --> 00:25:18.103]  And now the Soviet documents have been released, and everybody he accused of basically being a communist either had been a communist or had wanted to be a communist.
[00:25:20.084 --> 00:25:25.449]  Even books that Ronald Reagan has written, he admits his connection to it.
[00:25:25.489 --> 00:25:28.051]  Ronald Reagan read Ronnie, as he's truly known.
[00:25:28.491 --> 00:25:29.512]  Sorry if you don't want to hear this.
[00:25:30.273 --> 00:25:32.795]  Tried to join the Communist Party, and they said no to him.
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.621]  Did you know that that's public?
[00:25:39.842 --> 00:25:45.545]  So this was going on everywhere, but it wasn't really communists that were trying to take over the U.S.
[00:25:45.565 --> 00:25:45.906]  government.
[00:25:46.726 --> 00:25:49.948]  And this question goes to everything else we're facing.
[00:25:50.228 --> 00:25:51.209]  It's always the same.
[00:25:52.930 --> 00:26:00.614]  It's now admitted that it was the British Bank of England and the United States Federal Reserve in 1917 that funded Lenin.
[00:26:00.814 --> 00:26:02.955]  Now, that is public information.
[00:26:06.852 --> 00:26:22.802]  Train loads of gold bullion to fight the white Russians, to overthrow the British royal family, the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas cousins, who were, of course, the Tsar and the Tsarina and his children, and Rasputin and the whole nine yards.
[00:26:24.743 --> 00:26:26.505]  And again, this just goes into all of the history.
[00:26:28.186 --> 00:26:33.289]  And so they loved McCarthy when they could use him as a political tool
[00:26:34.679 --> 00:26:44.922]  To set up a police state in America and to get federal control over Hollywood to put out the type of propaganda that the federal government wanted.
[00:26:46.743 --> 00:26:49.924]  So, fascism, communism, it's all command and control.
[00:26:50.004 --> 00:27:04.328]  So while our government built up this Soviet threat to then create a bipolar world so they could turn America into a centralized police state in the name of countering that Soviet threat, MacArthur was great
[00:27:05.066 --> 00:27:10.029]  On his limited witch hunt, there be dragons, though.
[00:27:10.069 --> 00:27:11.430]  I mean, there were real problems.
[00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:28.000]  They loved to misdirect his energies and the sincerity that he had, that he was able to mobilize the population, but then misdirect with problem, reaction, solution, those activities against large sectors of society that were innocent.
[00:27:28.641 --> 00:27:33.924]  But many, if not most, or all of the government people he went after, were indeed agents of
[00:27:34.648 --> 00:27:43.555]  Globalist agents, UN agents, Alger Hiss, people that set up the UN, all of them, who really were socialists and Thabian socialists and communists.
[00:27:45.416 --> 00:27:49.899]  But then he discovered that the army was actually funding the Soviets.
[00:27:49.979 --> 00:27:56.284]  Then he discovered that there was a group above it that he began to call the One Worlders.
[00:27:58.146 --> 00:28:06.693]  Who worked using communism to basically socialize the wealth of the American people and transfer it through government to select corporations.
[00:28:07.073 --> 00:28:15.079]  And the minute he charged the Secretary of the Army with being a communist, the minute he broke through to understand what was happening,
[00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:28.881]  The minute he realized what the Dark Lord's plot was and how they were controlling both sides of the conflict, he was instantly thrown aside by Richard Milhouse Nixon and by Eisenhower and by others that have been using him.
[00:28:32.642 --> 00:28:33.783]  And so that's the facts.
[00:28:33.843 --> 00:28:39.806]  And now his name is synonymous with witch hunts and blacklisting and arbitrary government tyranny.
[00:28:42.074 --> 00:28:43.295]  Which is really a tragedy.
[00:28:43.635 --> 00:28:44.816]  And he was an alcoholic.
[00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:45.977]  He did have problems.
[00:28:46.017 --> 00:28:47.138]  You know, everybody sins.
[00:28:48.879 --> 00:28:54.784]  But Joseph McCarthy was the real McCoy, a maverick, and really did believe in what he was doing.
[00:28:54.824 --> 00:28:59.568]  And when he found out too much and wasn't useful anymore, they disposed of him politically, and he died shortly after.
[00:29:01.369 --> 00:29:04.471]  So that's the truth about Joseph McCarthy on the record.
[00:29:04.511 --> 00:29:07.273]  And I could go over the evidence of it for hours, but I've researched it.
[00:29:09.255 --> 00:29:11.797]  And it's time for people to stop
[00:29:12.831 --> 00:29:15.452]  Attacking him because really he's a straw man.
[00:29:17.773 --> 00:29:18.953]  And we need to understand this.
[00:29:19.034 --> 00:29:20.534]  We need to come to grips with this.
[00:29:20.614 --> 00:29:23.795]  I mean, it's the so-called conservatives that opened up China.
[00:29:24.436 --> 00:29:25.856]  That have shipped all our jobs there.
[00:29:26.296 --> 00:29:31.018]  It is Bill Clinton with communist generals in the White House giving them all the missile secrets.
[00:29:31.478 --> 00:29:33.259]  Rumsfeld giving reactors to North Korea.
[00:29:34.079 --> 00:29:35.200]  At every step of the way...
[00:29:36.016 --> 00:29:39.037]  See, the globalists couldn't take over the world and have America do it.
[00:29:39.057 --> 00:29:45.020]  They had to have a, quote, evil empire that was their mechanism to it to then blame that mechanism.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:47.360]  You understand?
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.741]  Now America's playing the role of that evil empire.
[00:29:52.022 --> 00:29:52.983]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.403 --> 00:29:55.043]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.924 --> 00:29:58.605]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:09.329]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.589 --> 00:31:13.930]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:23.152]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.352 --> 00:31:26.973]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.273 --> 00:31:32.281]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.602 --> 00:31:39.352]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:39.813 --> 00:31:40.193]  What about you?
[00:31:41.030 --> 00:31:41.731]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:12.453]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.

[00:32:24.524 --> 00:32:26.125]  So when thinking adoption, think Pets 911.
[00:32:30.083 --> 00:32:31.763]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:32:31.963 --> 00:32:33.964]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:32:34.164 --> 00:32:34.844]  Prepare yourself.
[00:32:35.024 --> 00:32:38.724]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[00:32:53.667 --> 00:32:54.407]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.000]  Don't worry.
[00:33:05.481 --> 00:33:07.042]  This show is documented.
[00:33:07.503 --> 00:33:10.265]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.685 --> 00:33:14.249]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:33:14.269 --> 00:33:15.229]  I went down, down, down.
[00:33:15.269 --> 00:33:18.853]  All right, we're going to strike back your calls, but let me boil this down a little bit simpler.
[00:33:19.273 --> 00:33:21.135]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[00:33:21.655 --> 00:33:29.342]  America at the end of World War II couldn't run around the globe taking over Eastern Europe, taking over Africa, Latin America.
[00:33:31.232 --> 00:33:34.816]  Putting in tyrannical regimes, looting the natural resources.
[00:33:35.837 --> 00:33:41.884]  So they were pushing the Soviet model and then advertising it to the third world as saviors.
[00:33:43.586 --> 00:33:45.948]  And so part of the third world did embrace it as saviors.
[00:33:46.128 --> 00:33:52.155]  Others that wanted to be free and independent, the globalists, and it came out later the CIA and others would even support communist regimes.
[00:33:53.661 --> 00:33:55.803]  In some cases, they would support fascist regimes.
[00:33:55.843 --> 00:33:56.424]  It didn't matter.
[00:33:56.924 --> 00:34:00.648]  As long as they controlled the leaders of it, and then they would overthrow those countries.
[00:34:00.668 --> 00:34:08.115]  Then some countries would then line up against the Soviets automatically, with the United States, and they'd put in police state governments as well.
[00:34:09.977 --> 00:34:14.461]  Well, now the model is... Well, going back again...
[00:34:15.402 --> 00:34:19.365]  They could then build up the national security apparatus here in the U.S.
[00:34:19.405 --> 00:34:27.350]  in the name of fighting that Soviet model and tell our troops and CIA, man, we've got to do horrible things to defeat the enemy because they're ruthless.
[00:34:27.390 --> 00:34:31.072]  We've got to be more ruthless and guard freedom with pure evil.
[00:34:31.693 --> 00:34:33.814]  Guard the truth with a bodyguard of lies.
[00:34:33.854 --> 00:34:36.496]  We've got to, yes, I'll do it for my country.
[00:34:36.596 --> 00:34:40.498]  I'm willing to blow up a school bus full of children to blame it on the evil commies.
[00:34:41.059 --> 00:34:42.860]  That way we'll save America.
[00:34:44.392 --> 00:34:45.934]  That's where these ideas came from.
[00:34:46.175 --> 00:34:47.356]  Again, it's mind control.
[00:34:47.397 --> 00:34:48.258]  It's manipulation.
[00:34:50.561 --> 00:34:52.865]  And then now the roles have been reversed.
[00:34:52.885 --> 00:34:56.410]  They tell us communism is dead, as it actually takes over more countries.
[00:34:57.006 --> 00:34:59.307]  And they go, the new age of freedom has dawned.
[00:34:59.328 --> 00:35:08.533]  The EU is against torture and is against evil and stands against America, the evil empire, the evil empire that's taking over.
[00:35:08.553 --> 00:35:19.040]  The UN and the new EU is working with the third world and can be trusted and the evil Americans are taking over and grabbing all these third world countries and resources.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:20.861]  Why, here's their own documents.
[00:35:21.989 --> 00:35:28.271]  And again, it gives people that false choice, and they go, we must have a loving world government to counter the evil right-wing world government.
[00:35:28.552 --> 00:35:35.034]  And then now, either way, you're now debating about what type of world government to have, instead of debating, do we want a new world order?
[00:35:37.495 --> 00:35:39.736]  They're experts, just like in the presidential race.
[00:35:39.816 --> 00:35:40.896]  Kerry versus Bush.
[00:35:40.976 --> 00:35:42.057]  Cousins, skull and bones.
[00:35:42.137 --> 00:35:44.278]  Exact same policies, a little bit of different rhetoric.
[00:35:44.858 --> 00:35:47.359]  It's about fooling you, giving you false choices.
[00:35:49.835 --> 00:36:15.749]  They tell Iraq, either you accept UN continual sanctions for another 12 years, and millions of dead, and inspectors everywhere, and you're not allowed to have any industry, and we control you, or, that's for the good cop, total siege, or the evil Americans will come and blow you to bits with depleted uranium, will salt your earth with uranium, will take you over, and do as we will.
[00:36:17.439 --> 00:36:22.243]  Oh, well, I'm for the loving UN that only wages genocide via siege.
[00:36:22.283 --> 00:36:23.444]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:36:24.145 --> 00:36:29.689]  Oh, we've got to let the International Atomic Energy Inspectors in.
[00:36:29.789 --> 00:36:31.090]  The IAEA.
[00:36:31.271 --> 00:36:32.652]  Oh, they're so good.
[00:36:34.273 --> 00:36:35.114]  You're starting to figure this.
[00:36:35.194 --> 00:36:37.776]  And then you look at who runs and founded the UN.
[00:36:37.796 --> 00:36:39.277]  You look at who owns the same corporations.
[00:36:39.517 --> 00:36:42.680]  You look at who owns American corporations funding the neocons.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.921]  It's all European families.
[00:36:44.645 --> 00:36:45.666]  They have a controlling interest.
[00:36:46.066 --> 00:36:46.867]  It's a joke!
[00:36:46.947 --> 00:36:47.948]  It's a fraud!
[00:36:47.968 --> 00:36:51.790]  And you better figure this out, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:51.830 --> 00:36:58.195]  I hear these ridiculous leftists on the radio going, The evil world government Bush has formed.
[00:36:58.255 --> 00:36:59.136]  It's horrible.
[00:36:59.356 --> 00:37:02.438]  We must counter it with a loving liberal world government.
[00:37:02.458 --> 00:37:04.560]  You know, that's what Noam Chomsky and all those people say.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:06.822]  People go, Oh, they're such geniuses.
[00:37:06.862 --> 00:37:09.023]  They're such political minds.
[00:37:09.063 --> 00:37:10.585]  He's incredible.
[00:37:10.605 --> 00:37:12.286]  I have to hear it from these people.
[00:37:13.266 --> 00:37:13.746]  Wake up!
[00:37:13.786 --> 00:37:15.808]  Stop being fooled by false choices!
[00:37:17.609 --> 00:37:20.612]  Brendan in Idaho, you're on the air.
[00:37:20.652 --> 00:37:20.972]  Welcome.
[00:37:21.733 --> 00:37:22.373]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:37:22.833 --> 00:37:23.154]  Hello.
[00:37:23.654 --> 00:37:30.359]  Hey, I don't know if you talked about the opening of the pipeline out of Azerbaijan.
[00:37:30.399 --> 00:37:31.240]  Got a new one here.
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:33.381]  Yes, let the oil flow.
[00:37:33.541 --> 00:37:41.928]  Yeah, it's funny because when I was in the military, I was stationed over there in Turkey, and that seems as if that pipeline runs right past the base.
[00:37:42.995 --> 00:37:50.397]  Of course, that was back in the Flick Willie days, so there wasn't much going on back then, but I just wanted to... There was a lot going on.
[00:37:50.417 --> 00:37:53.478]  We were invading Serbia after using Al-Qaeda to attack them.
[00:37:53.818 --> 00:37:54.938]  Well, compared to now.
[00:37:54.978 --> 00:37:56.839]  The old blow out the school bus trick again.
[00:37:57.239 --> 00:38:01.040]  Yeah, the Yugoslavia and all that was minuscule compared to what's going on now.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:02.800]  Or at least it seems that way.
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:04.001]  Or it did seem that way.
[00:38:04.961 --> 00:38:08.622]  But, yeah, did you want to comment on that?
[00:38:08.662 --> 00:38:12.223]  You know, with Dick Cheney being the CEO of Halliburton at that time and
[00:38:12.694 --> 00:38:13.815]  Pushing that deal through.
[00:38:14.475 --> 00:38:15.756]  Well, there's no connection.
[00:38:15.796 --> 00:38:20.360]  Dick Cheney's doing a wonderful job.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:26.185]  It's Al-Qaeda talk to talk bad about our leader who ordered Nordad to stand down on 9-11.
[00:38:26.205 --> 00:38:27.426]  He's a great man.
[00:38:28.527 --> 00:38:29.507]  He's a good man.
[00:38:29.527 --> 00:38:30.948]  Thanks for the call.
[00:38:30.988 --> 00:38:31.569]  Good points.
[00:38:31.929 --> 00:38:32.530]  I appreciate it.
[00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:33.851]  Yeah, let me just say something about that.
[00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:39.075]  Again, the media will focus on a Richard Clark, National Security Advisor,
[00:38:40.447 --> 00:38:54.700]  They'll focus on a Treasury Secretary like O'Neill going, yeah, day one, they had big maps and said they were going to get the oil, and they said they didn't care about tariffs, don't worry about it, and they go, oh, they're just salad grapes, look at them.
[00:38:55.541 --> 00:39:00.105]  How dare those traitors, they're just democratic operatives, and we'll go,
[00:39:01.531 --> 00:39:03.052]  Forget what they said.
[00:39:03.713 --> 00:39:11.578]  We now have all the memos and orders of Dick Cheney in the White House, literally handing out the oil contracts and government contracts from his desk.
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.682]  Unbelievable war profiteering.
[00:39:16.782 --> 00:39:22.146]  And just bid rigging and scanning into hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:39:23.504 --> 00:39:32.850]  And then again, we have Dick Cheney and the September 2000, September 20, 2000 PNAC documents saying, we need helpful Pearl Harbor terror attacks to mobilize the people.
[00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:38.174]  Saddam isn't a threat, but we can use him as a threat to get the oil and use Iraq as a launch base.
[00:39:38.474 --> 00:39:40.075]  All we need is the right trigger.
[00:39:40.375 --> 00:39:41.576]  You ought to go read this stuff.
[00:39:42.296 --> 00:39:45.519]  And imagine, they publish this knowing you're never going to read it.
[00:39:46.559 --> 00:39:48.000]  The fools will never know.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.622]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:39:52.904 --> 00:39:55.626]  And notice the media steadfastly ignores that.
[00:39:57.427 --> 00:39:59.508]  Here's another example of what they do.
[00:40:00.929 --> 00:40:03.010]  Bill Clinton did whatever he was told.
[00:40:04.371 --> 00:40:09.074]  Even at that time, we're now learning, was vacationing with the Bushes secretly even when he was president.
[00:40:09.495 --> 00:40:11.476]  Vacationed with them before he was president.
[00:40:11.536 --> 00:40:12.496]  Met with Bush Sr.
[00:40:13.257 --> 00:40:18.060]  11 times at little retreats in the year before he announced for the presidency.
[00:40:18.812 --> 00:40:21.594]  Went with Bush envoys to Bilderberg Group in 91.
[00:40:21.914 --> 00:40:22.775]  This is all admitted.
[00:40:23.015 --> 00:40:24.976]  Now a member of the family.
[00:40:25.296 --> 00:40:27.017]  Oh, they vacation together.
[00:40:27.037 --> 00:40:36.063]  And we'd hear, what a traitor Bill Clinton is, giving the supercomputers to China, giving the missile diagrams the MIRV technology.
[00:40:37.404 --> 00:40:47.951]  So an ICBM can have a dozen warheads and another dozen dummies to fool the anti-missile systems when it comes back into orbit and comes back into the atmosphere.
[00:40:48.994 --> 00:40:59.500]  And Bill Clinton was a traitor that allowed the nuclear reactors that could be easily weaponized for weapons-grade uranium and plutonium to be transferred to North Korea.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:04.743]  But who was on the board of the company that transferred them?
[00:41:04.783 --> 00:41:05.623]  Donald Rumsfeld.
[00:41:05.884 --> 00:41:10.706]  Who ran the big companies that were transferring the supercomputers and missile secrets to China?
[00:41:11.567 --> 00:41:13.508]  Who was running the law firms that did it?
[00:41:13.828 --> 00:41:16.930]  Who was running the law firms that lobbied for giving them the Panama Canal?
[00:41:18.379 --> 00:41:32.883]  It was always James Baker, George, Herbert Walker Bush, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, this whole string of little minions of the Red King of the New World Order.
[00:41:35.897 --> 00:41:41.442]  Over and over again, but oh, we would hiss and scream, Bill Clinton, you're evil!
[00:41:41.963 --> 00:41:45.106]  But then Bush comes in and goes, I will take all restrictions off supercomputers.
[00:41:45.446 --> 00:41:47.368]  I will take all restrictions off MIRV technology.
[00:41:47.628 --> 00:41:49.570]  I will take the restrictions off the nuclear reactors.
[00:41:49.810 --> 00:41:53.033]  I will take all, and we just go, oh, how conservative of you!
[00:41:57.297 --> 00:41:58.618]  On and on and on and on and on.
[00:41:58.658 --> 00:41:59.960]  Here's another example of twisting.
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:01.481]  Of total twisting.
[00:42:03.317 --> 00:42:06.900]  They'll go, Newsweek might have gotten something wrong.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.602]  We really won't tell you what about the Koran and the toilet.
[00:42:10.102 --> 00:42:12.024]  They're not sure if their source is accurate.
[00:42:12.044 --> 00:42:13.645]  Mmm, they retract.
[00:42:14.786 --> 00:42:17.228]  And then now whenever you hear a story about torture, oh, it's retracted.
[00:42:17.568 --> 00:42:23.312]  They don't tell you that Brigadier General Rick Baucus quit refusing to torture two and a half years ago at Camp X-Ray.
[00:42:23.573 --> 00:42:29.097]  They don't tell you that that very same week, an interrogator and an interpreter quit saying the exact same things.
[00:42:29.117 --> 00:42:30.458]  They were torturing these people to death.
[00:42:31.776 --> 00:42:38.641]  They ignore Alberto Gonzalez's own memos when he was the chief counsel to the president, saying, you're above the law, my leader.
[00:42:38.661 --> 00:42:41.723]  You're above federal and international and state law.
[00:42:41.963 --> 00:42:43.845]  We can torture them until they die.
[00:42:43.865 --> 00:42:44.565]  He even says that.
[00:42:44.785 --> 00:42:45.846]  We can drown them.
[00:42:45.886 --> 00:42:47.547]  We can torture them, my lord.
[00:42:47.567 --> 00:42:50.630]  My leader.
[00:42:50.650 --> 00:42:53.232]  I mean, it actually says all of this.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.560]  And then we debate.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:42:58.421]  Is torture going on?
[00:42:58.541 --> 00:42:59.242]  I don't know.
[00:42:59.722 --> 00:43:01.123]  Why Newsweek retracted?
[00:43:01.163 --> 00:43:02.563]  That was all staged.
[00:43:06.925 --> 00:43:08.066]  Goodness gracious.
[00:43:09.046 --> 00:43:10.227]  All right, let's go back to calls.
[00:43:13.048 --> 00:43:15.129]  Michael in California.
[00:43:15.169 --> 00:43:15.750]  Welcome, sir.
[00:43:16.530 --> 00:43:16.870]  Thank you.
[00:43:17.831 --> 00:43:21.672]  You had a caller yesterday who said they had a visit from Homeland Security.
[00:43:22.453 --> 00:43:24.794]  Well, we had one, too, after a fashion on Monday.
[00:43:26.444 --> 00:43:29.665]  We handle most of my mother-in-law's affairs now, including her banking.
[00:43:30.745 --> 00:43:34.586]  She wanted to open up another CD with the higher interest rates.
[00:43:35.186 --> 00:43:36.026]  So I called the banker.
[00:43:36.366 --> 00:43:37.707]  That sounds Al Qaeda-ish.
[00:43:37.987 --> 00:43:39.587]  And he went, well, oh, it was.
[00:43:40.007 --> 00:43:40.327]  It was.
[00:43:41.647 --> 00:43:45.628]  The banker, who we've known for a long time, he went through everything, and he just did it right on the phone.
[00:43:45.648 --> 00:43:47.969]  He said, well, you're in that new account at the higher interest rate.
[00:43:48.369 --> 00:43:53.450]  And then he said, but there's a few more things as of this Monday due to Homeland Security issues.
[00:43:54.182 --> 00:43:56.243]  And the Patriot Act that we have to ask you.
[00:43:56.263 --> 00:43:58.744]  Now, most of this stuff they already knew.
[00:43:58.764 --> 00:44:02.085]  And it's the know your customer they can never get before.
[00:44:02.645 --> 00:44:05.606]  Yeah, they've only banked with them for 35 years.
[00:44:05.886 --> 00:44:08.947]  And the banks have to act as the agents of the government without pay.
[00:44:09.687 --> 00:44:12.568]  Yes, yes, which I believe that was banned by the 13th Amendment.
[00:44:13.869 --> 00:44:20.671]  But anyways, most of this they already knew, but they had such things as where they were born, when they were born,
[00:44:21.229 --> 00:44:23.991]  When their driver's license is issued, when it will expire.
[00:44:24.011 --> 00:44:28.234]  And he got very nervous and very hesitant on the last two questions.
[00:44:29.135 --> 00:44:34.299]  Question one was, what is the reason for opening the account?
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.784]  Question number two, the bombshell, what is her total net worth?
[00:44:42.165 --> 00:44:45.007]  And I said to him, is this a part of the law?
[00:44:45.127 --> 00:44:46.568]  He said, yeah, it's right in the law.
[00:44:46.608 --> 00:44:49.851]  We just got the notification it's supposed to start today, which was this last Monday.
[00:44:50.885 --> 00:44:53.087]  And I said, what if she doesn't want to do this?
[00:44:53.107 --> 00:44:58.211]  And he said, oh, well, if we'd have to close this account and send the money back to her in a cashier's check.
[00:44:59.553 --> 00:45:02.355]  And then, of course, we thought, well, what are you going to do with the money then?
[00:45:02.375 --> 00:45:07.900]  Because he said, all banks, savings and loans, institutions, mutual funds, brokerage,
[00:45:08.744 --> 00:45:10.586]  All have to gather this same information.
[00:45:10.606 --> 00:45:14.048]  Well, sir, it's used cars, new cars, appliances.
[00:45:14.629 --> 00:45:16.410]  Everything is a snoop grid.
[00:45:16.810 --> 00:45:22.775]  All your purchases, all of your prescriptions you get are instantly uploaded.
[00:45:23.015 --> 00:45:27.138]  That's why I read articles months ago about all these cashing places are closing down.
[00:45:27.158 --> 00:45:32.782]  They go, look, there are 500,000 people on a criminal list, 300-something thousand on a terror list.
[00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:34.624]  You don't even have to be convicted to...
[00:45:36.203 --> 00:45:40.206]  But we have to check this list, and we can't even cash your checks if you're on this.
[00:45:40.546 --> 00:45:41.527]  It's like a no-fly list.
[00:45:41.547 --> 00:45:42.488]  It's a no-buy list.
[00:45:43.128 --> 00:45:48.092]  And so I guess you were hesitant, so you had to file a suspicious activities report?
[00:45:48.712 --> 00:45:52.215]  Well, no, since I was actually on someone else's behalf, I was just asking questions.
[00:45:52.775 --> 00:45:53.936]  So what happened to you?
[00:45:54.977 --> 00:45:55.758]  Well, nothing yet.
[00:45:56.758 --> 00:45:58.480]  Oh, so that's your little visit with Homeland Security.
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:01.262]  Well, yes, after a fashion, indirectly.
[00:46:01.282 --> 00:46:01.442]  Okay.
[00:46:01.815 --> 00:46:03.356]  Well, sir, I mean, it's everywhere.
[00:46:03.516 --> 00:46:06.958]  And I mean, look, for those that don't know, there's a hundred cases of this I could cover right now.
[00:46:07.058 --> 00:46:09.860]  We have a section on Prison Planet that covers it, but here it is.
[00:46:11.341 --> 00:46:16.244]  Magic Cube, the patent on the Rubik's Cube has been up for three years.
[00:46:17.765 --> 00:46:25.990]  And two years after it was up, or a year and a half after it was up, a company in New York called, a large division, but its product is called Magic Cube.
[00:46:26.030 --> 00:46:28.572]  And strangely enough, I'd even bought one of these products.
[00:46:29.822 --> 00:46:31.562]  About a year ago, even before I heard about this story.
[00:46:32.083 --> 00:46:33.403]  Magic Cube, a knockoff.
[00:46:34.583 --> 00:46:37.564]  And so the woman, and she wasn't the manufacturer.
[00:46:37.584 --> 00:46:38.744]  It sold in all major stores.
[00:46:38.944 --> 00:46:39.544]  Little St.
[00:46:39.584 --> 00:46:43.005]  Helen City, little 1,500 foot square foot business.
[00:46:43.285 --> 00:46:45.906]  She bought 10 Magic Cubes from the major distributor.
[00:46:46.426 --> 00:46:48.187]  Toys R Us, everyone covers it, carries it.
[00:46:48.967 --> 00:46:49.607]  And she gets a call.
[00:46:50.379 --> 00:46:51.420]  This is Homeland Security.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.621]  We'll not identify our names.
[00:46:52.661 --> 00:46:54.182]  We're just telling you you're under terror.
[00:46:54.962 --> 00:46:55.342]  Watch.
[00:46:56.083 --> 00:46:57.304]  We will be visiting you soon.
[00:46:57.524 --> 00:46:58.765]  So she starts calling Homeland Security.
[00:46:58.785 --> 00:46:59.886]  They say, we will not talk to you.
[00:46:59.906 --> 00:47:02.087]  You're not allowed to tell anyone that we called you.
[00:47:02.127 --> 00:47:03.488]  This is all in the Patriot Act, the first one.
[00:47:04.729 --> 00:47:06.650]  Then a month and a half later, they walk in.
[00:47:06.750 --> 00:47:11.053]  Two agents had driven over 100 miles from Seattle in the nearby state of Washington.
[00:47:11.674 --> 00:47:13.135]  They come in, and we had her on the show.
[00:47:13.175 --> 00:47:15.036]  This was also the Associated Press in the Oregonian.
[00:47:16.286 --> 00:47:26.108]  They walk into her and they say, ma'am, we're agent such and such, and we read their names on air, and they said, you will take those, she had sold a few of them, you will take those magic cubes off the shelf.
[00:47:26.168 --> 00:47:36.511]  And she said, all these months I've been in fear for some type of terrorism, not knowing what was going on, I have no criminal record, and you're telling me to take magic cubes off the shelf?
[00:47:36.551 --> 00:47:37.251]  Where's your warrant?
[00:47:37.291 --> 00:47:38.071]  Where's your court order?
[00:47:38.611 --> 00:47:40.032]  And they said, we don't have to have that.
[00:47:40.072 --> 00:47:41.172]  You'll take them off the shelf.
[00:47:41.932 --> 00:47:44.433]  And they said, she said, well, I thought you dealt with terrorists.
[00:47:44.453 --> 00:47:45.113]  And they said, ma'am,
[00:47:46.149 --> 00:47:47.809]  We are in infrastructure protection.
[00:47:48.709 --> 00:47:51.390]  Anything that violates the infrastructure is terrorism.
[00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:52.010]  This is a quote.
[00:47:53.150 --> 00:47:53.730]  And they left.
[00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:55.831]  So she called the toy manufacturer.
[00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:57.031]  She called Rubik's Cube.
[00:47:57.051 --> 00:47:59.191]  And they said, no, of course, the patent's up.
[00:48:00.612 --> 00:48:14.254]  The point is, they're following orders on purpose, sir, to set the, if they can see, if they can set the asinine precedent of going to a tiny toy store that sells a legal toy
[00:48:15.097 --> 00:48:16.778]  And threaten someone with arrest.
[00:48:17.499 --> 00:48:20.922]  That, again, sets the insane precedent.
[00:48:21.002 --> 00:48:22.062]  Or you complain too much.
[00:48:22.102 --> 00:48:23.363]  You threaten no one, but you complain.
[00:48:23.644 --> 00:48:24.684]  We're arresting you as a terrorist.
[00:48:24.905 --> 00:48:30.969]  Oh, you pay the county commissioner a $4,000 donation to get more zoning space, parking places.
[00:48:31.009 --> 00:48:32.090]  We call that terrorism.
[00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:33.111]  You don't get the process.
[00:48:33.131 --> 00:48:33.611]  Patriot Act.
[00:48:33.651 --> 00:48:34.212]  We're arresting you.
[00:48:34.612 --> 00:48:36.213]  They're setting the precedent.
[00:48:37.134 --> 00:48:39.296]  And it will be the ultimate tyranny.
[00:48:40.356 --> 00:48:40.476]  And...
[00:48:42.043 --> 00:48:42.843]  It's there, sir.
[00:48:43.504 --> 00:48:47.005]  And so, this is your new freedom, Michael.
[00:48:47.325 --> 00:48:48.165]  I hope you enjoy it.
[00:48:49.366 --> 00:48:52.907]  I think there's going to be substantial resistance.
[00:48:52.967 --> 00:48:56.448]  He told me that every client that... He sounded very fearful.
[00:48:56.648 --> 00:48:59.329]  He said every client that he has is raising the roof about this.
[00:48:59.489 --> 00:49:00.450]  Everybody's pissed off.
[00:49:00.930 --> 00:49:03.211]  He sounded like he'd been beaten up all week when I talked to him.
[00:49:03.251 --> 00:49:05.852]  Well, sir, it's called the Fifth Amendment.
[00:49:05.992 --> 00:49:07.712]  I mean, and I appreciate your call, Michael.
[00:49:07.732 --> 00:49:08.533]  Thanks for that info.
[00:49:08.573 --> 00:49:09.513]  I mean, look.
[00:49:10.917 --> 00:49:11.678]  Understand, folks.
[00:49:13.139 --> 00:49:15.280]  I've used this analogy before, but let's use another one.
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:19.984]  I won't use the analogy of the police pulling over the guy, and there's the person beating on the trunk.
[00:49:20.964 --> 00:49:22.626]  And they pull out the person who's tied up.
[00:49:22.666 --> 00:49:26.769]  They still can't make the serial killer in the front of the car answer questions.
[00:49:27.469 --> 00:49:34.374]  Because the Founding Fathers said, hey, he's dangerous, but it's more dangerous to have a government that can make you incriminate yourself, because they're the ultimate killers.
[00:49:35.495 --> 00:49:36.816]  In his free, in common sense.
[00:49:39.538 --> 00:49:42.821]  So they can't make you... But all over the place, judges will just order people.
[00:49:42.861 --> 00:49:47.584]  I've been in courtrooms when they're screaming at someone, You will answer my questions or I will hold you in contempt!
[00:49:48.625 --> 00:49:52.328]  And the person doesn't know they're with the amendment, and answers me.
[00:49:52.628 --> 00:49:54.870]  It's just bold-faced tyranny, folks.
[00:49:55.430 --> 00:50:01.294]  Cops march up on your videotape in one of their checkpoints from 200 yards away and say, Turn that camera off!
[00:50:01.375 --> 00:50:02.215]  I'll arrest you!
[00:50:03.736 --> 00:50:04.557]  Well, what's the law?
[00:50:04.637 --> 00:50:05.758]  I don't need a law!
[00:50:07.248 --> 00:50:10.909]  I am the man, Judge Dredd, the executioner.
[00:50:10.929 --> 00:50:13.810]  There's no more freedom, scum!
[00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:16.850]  And you don't have the freedom to say there's no freedom.
[00:50:18.371 --> 00:50:22.752]  But we're in kind of a paradox right now, where freedom still exists in our hearts and minds and our actions.
[00:50:23.072 --> 00:50:24.592]  We breathe life into freedom.
[00:50:25.212 --> 00:50:26.633]  We hold it up as a standard.
[00:50:27.073 --> 00:50:31.894]  And then they tell us, no, no, freedom is the freedom to have no freedom.
[00:50:33.314 --> 00:50:34.534]  War is peace.
[00:50:35.935 --> 00:50:36.555]  Slavery...
[00:50:37.142 --> 00:50:38.343]  Is happiness.
[00:50:39.784 --> 00:50:40.984]  Torture is love.
[00:50:41.465 --> 00:50:42.645]  Now shut up!
[00:50:43.766 --> 00:50:44.907]  And submit to us.
[00:50:44.987 --> 00:50:46.568]  Give us control over you.
[00:50:47.168 --> 00:50:48.649]  Let us run your lives.
[00:50:48.729 --> 00:50:50.270]  It's in your own best interest.
[00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:52.151]  Government has never done wrong.
[00:50:52.631 --> 00:50:53.892]  All goodness flows from it.
[00:50:54.052 --> 00:50:57.895]  Now shut up or I'll crack your skull with my belly club sleeve!
[00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:02.993]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.173 --> 00:51:06.256]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:10.319]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.359 --> 00:51:14.583]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[00:51:14.924 --> 00:51:18.707]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.848 --> 00:51:20.709]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:24.173]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.193 --> 00:51:25.294]  The medical bills...
[00:51:26.955 --> 00:51:28.897]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.058 --> 00:51:32.101]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.281 --> 00:51:35.144]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.624 --> 00:51:41.751]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.

[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:37.909]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.409 --> 00:52:42.852]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:54:08.311 --> 00:54:10.653]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:12.095 --> 00:54:15.238]  I mean, classical tyranny is unfolding all around us.
[00:54:16.319 --> 00:54:19.722]  The government's going to track and trace everything we do, micromanage us.
[00:54:20.523 --> 00:54:27.149]  None of it's terror-related, but oh, we're going to order the Border Patrol to stand down and call people that report illegals evil vigilantes.
[00:54:29.351 --> 00:54:30.392]  None of it makes any sense.
[00:54:30.453 --> 00:54:30.773]  We're going to...
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.441]  Make you eat genetically modified food.
[00:54:33.481 --> 00:54:34.182]  Put it into everything.
[00:54:34.202 --> 00:54:35.942]  It doesn't matter if it kills the rats that eat it.
[00:54:36.363 --> 00:54:37.903]  We're going to use DU all over the planet.
[00:54:37.923 --> 00:54:40.205]  It doesn't matter if our own Army handbook says it's going to kill you.
[00:54:40.965 --> 00:54:42.346]  We're going to do all these horrible things.
[00:54:42.366 --> 00:54:44.147]  We're going to put all these experimental vaccines in you.
[00:54:44.167 --> 00:54:47.609]  We're going to tell you it's the law to take vaccines when it isn't the law.
[00:54:48.029 --> 00:54:51.511]  We're going to lie and abscond and engage in all this, and you're going to submit to it.
[00:54:52.971 --> 00:54:55.773]  All right, Ray and Blake and Mike and many others, your calls are coming up.
[00:54:56.969 --> 00:55:00.290]  Before I go back to your calls, we'll continue with calls throughout the broadcast and a ton of news.
[00:55:00.330 --> 00:55:02.070]  Paul Watson coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:55:03.650 --> 00:55:08.131]  Before I do that, I'm not going to spend a lot of time on this.
[00:55:08.151 --> 00:55:09.292]  I hope you'll grab a pen and paper.
[00:55:09.312 --> 00:55:16.693]  If you live in central Texas or the surrounding areas, I suggest you come to my Friday, June 3rd.
[00:55:16.713 --> 00:55:18.954]  Coming up next Friday, folks.
[00:55:19.634 --> 00:55:25.895]  My Friday, June 3rd double showing of martial law 9-11 rise of the police state.
[00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:27.472]  My best film yet.
[00:55:27.492 --> 00:55:28.253]  We'll show the film.
[00:55:28.634 --> 00:55:30.177]  Take questions and comments after it.
[00:55:30.197 --> 00:55:32.221]  It's a great theater downtown Austin.
[00:55:32.241 --> 00:55:33.524]  Alamo Draft House downtown.
[00:55:35.428 --> 00:55:35.548]  And...
[00:55:36.502 --> 00:55:37.802]  We're going to have a 7 to 10 p.m.
[00:55:37.882 --> 00:55:40.683]  showing, because it always overflows if we have a single showing.
[00:55:41.243 --> 00:55:42.844]  Either showing will be just as good.
[00:55:42.904 --> 00:55:43.724]  I'll be at both of them.
[00:55:44.084 --> 00:55:45.384]  I have my books and videos there.
[00:55:45.764 --> 00:55:53.166]  Coming up the next week, June 8th, Wednesday, June 8th, one showing at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar.
[00:55:53.626 --> 00:56:01.128]  Go to InfoWars.com and link through to the Alamo Draft House website to the subsection where you can buy tickets beforehand to the event.
[00:56:01.824 --> 00:56:03.245]  Or you can buy them there at the door.
[00:56:03.385 --> 00:56:09.727]  And if any of the events sell out beforehand, I'll tell you what events haven't sold out on the website and here on the broadcast.
[00:56:09.747 --> 00:56:11.928]  But don't wait, and I can't wait to see you there.
[00:56:12.008 --> 00:56:17.690]  Great place to meet like-minded people and to get involved in the fight against the New World Order.
[00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:23.972]  And then last but not least, if you want a hard copy of Martial Law, you've heard the rave reviews from the listeners.
[00:56:24.012 --> 00:56:24.792]  It's my best work.
[00:56:24.812 --> 00:56:28.254]  It covers 9-11, who the globalist are, the police state they're setting up.
[00:56:28.314 --> 00:56:29.294]  It's an incredible film.
[00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:31.830]  Toll-free number to order it.
[00:56:31.931 --> 00:56:33.552]  Operators are standing by right now.
[00:56:33.572 --> 00:56:36.215]  A lot of big discounts on the new film and other films.
[00:56:36.255 --> 00:56:37.777]  Just ask about them when you call.

[00:57:07.334 --> 00:57:07.795]  Don't wait.
[00:57:08.715 --> 00:57:10.797]  Ray in Montreal, Canada.
[00:57:10.837 --> 00:57:11.298]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:57:11.338 --> 00:57:12.259]  Yeah, hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:57:12.539 --> 00:57:12.859]  Hello.
[00:57:12.899 --> 00:57:13.480]  I was wondering...
[00:57:15.089 --> 00:57:16.510]  Are you aware of this guy?
[00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:19.991]  I saw the article on Drudge Report, but it didn't stay there very long.
[00:57:20.051 --> 00:57:24.153]  It says it was on San Francisco Chronicle on May the 22nd.
[00:57:24.233 --> 00:57:28.915]  Ted recruits for wage campaign against Green Card Marine.
[00:57:30.596 --> 00:57:36.478]  It says here, Fernando Suarez, dead solar, feels a sense of urgency about the war in Iraq.
[00:57:36.839 --> 00:57:39.140]  And not just because he lost his son two years ago.
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.001]  And he's going around with all these, let's know...
[00:57:42.856 --> 00:57:43.436]  Well, yeah, no, no, no.
[00:57:43.456 --> 00:57:44.817]  25% of the troops in Iraq were illegal aliens.
[00:57:44.837 --> 00:57:49.099]  They're instantly made legal and then given their citizenship once they get involved in all this.
[00:57:49.239 --> 00:57:52.621]  It's like the British had the German troops, the Hessians, to invade America.
[00:57:52.641 --> 00:57:53.881]  We now have a foreign army.
[00:58:11.502 --> 00:58:13.884]  But can you have this... I think he speaks English.
[00:58:13.904 --> 00:58:17.646]  Could you have this guy on your shows, Fernando Suarez de la Sola?
[00:58:17.926 --> 00:58:18.427]  Yes, sir.
[00:58:18.507 --> 00:58:19.948]  Will you email me the link?
[00:58:20.468 --> 00:58:20.768]  Yes.
[00:58:21.769 --> 00:58:24.031]  For your list, it's on San Francisco Chronicle.
[00:58:24.191 --> 00:58:26.492]  It's on Sunday, May the 22nd.
[00:58:26.973 --> 00:58:30.255]  And also, another thing I want to tell you about your DVD there.
[00:58:31.316 --> 00:58:34.058]  Now, you mentioned your wife speaks Spanish.
[00:58:34.978 --> 00:58:37.180]  Is it possible to have a sub in Spanish?
[00:58:38.024 --> 00:58:40.707]  You know, I've had a lot of requests to do that, and if I had the time, I would.
[00:58:40.747 --> 00:58:41.468]  I tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:41.488 --> 00:58:42.649]  We'll talk about it on the other side.
[00:58:43.370 --> 00:58:47.474]  No, I mean, we've got a lot of requests for Espanol, and I'd love to do it.
[00:58:47.494 --> 00:58:48.195]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:48.215 --> 00:58:57.404]  Stay with us.
[00:58:57.644 --> 00:58:58.285]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.966 --> 00:58:59.947]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:01.049 --> 00:59:03.290]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.030 --> 00:59:04.911]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.591 --> 00:59:09.512]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.773 --> 00:59:13.854]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.468 --> 00:59:29.591]  All right, back live into the second hour, 25th day of May, 2005, on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:59:30.152 --> 00:59:34.574]  Paul Watson will be joining us coming up in about 30 minutes with a huge news update and news blitz.
[00:59:34.954 --> 00:59:39.577]  For the balance of the broadcast, we'll continue with the open phones throughout this transmission against tyranny.
[00:59:39.637 --> 00:59:41.258]  Right now, I'm trying to hurry through your calls.
[00:59:41.758 --> 00:59:46.741]  Then coming up, more on the illegal alien group saying they want to poison the Minutemen's food.
[00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:47.601]  1,000 U.S.
[00:59:47.881 --> 00:59:49.262]  troops launch offensive in Iraq.
[00:59:50.049 --> 00:59:53.810]  There's so much news coming up, and I will get to it early in the shower, but let's continue with your calls.
[00:59:54.991 --> 01:00:00.453]  We're talking to Ray in Montreal, Canada, and he was asking why we haven't put martial law out on Spanish.
[01:00:02.333 --> 01:00:03.094]  I need to do that.
[01:00:03.294 --> 01:00:07.775]  I mean, I've had a lot of requests, more than any, to put it out in Spanish, also some to put it out in German.
[01:00:09.416 --> 01:00:14.198]  And it would take time to go in and then insert that, to have somebody translate it properly.
[01:00:14.238 --> 01:00:14.578]  It would take...
[01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:19.454]  Also, I would encourage you to do Brazilian Portuguese, you know, because right now you have...
[01:00:41.795 --> 01:00:46.696]  Brazil, and especially Venezuela, were having problems with the U.S.
[01:00:46.816 --> 01:00:52.078]  Now, if they would have... Now, Portuguese, that'd be hard to find somebody that spoke Portuguese.
[01:00:53.698 --> 01:01:00.340]  Also, I noticed you, there was this guy that saw all the articles in your DVD and put it on a website, right?
[01:01:00.954 --> 01:01:02.416]  It's a beautiful site.
[01:01:02.456 --> 01:01:05.318]  It's marshalllaw911.info.
[01:01:05.578 --> 01:01:12.865]  Okay, now is it possible in the future release of your DVD to include that website and DVD like in a form of a PDF file?
[01:01:13.045 --> 01:01:16.769]  Hey, I think we're probably going to do that in another printing of the film.
[01:01:17.109 --> 01:01:18.170]  He's done the work for us.
[01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:20.953]  He did an admirable job, and we'll probably do that.
[01:01:21.553 --> 01:01:24.035]  Okay, one tidbit of news I want to tell you about.
[01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:25.517]  You talk about that and getting about that.
[01:01:25.982 --> 01:01:27.423]  Yeah, now we have 7,000 cases a year of wet leprosy
[01:01:49.224 --> 01:01:52.007]  And before, it didn't even exist in this country.
[01:01:52.207 --> 01:01:58.192]  Yeah, but now they're saying to people, oh, well, why don't you go and open your summer house or summer camp?
[01:01:58.272 --> 01:01:59.373]  It's very simple, you know?
[01:01:59.714 --> 01:02:06.319]  Open the window and wear a mask and gloves, but don't use a vacuum cleaner because it's going to go in the air and make you sick and you can die.
[01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:09.803]  Yeah, that's transmitted by the rats.
[01:02:10.223 --> 01:02:11.104]  Yeah, the rats.
[01:02:11.124 --> 01:02:14.127]  And also, another thing, you're probably not aware of it, it's...
[01:02:15.529 --> 01:02:18.550]  You know, there were some people in the U.S.
[01:02:18.590 --> 01:02:22.632]  that, because of the 9-11 law, decided to move to Canada, you know?
[01:02:22.852 --> 01:02:23.133]  Yes, sir.
[01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:26.254]  But they don't realize in Canada we have a terrorist list, you know?
[01:02:26.874 --> 01:02:33.457]  Oh, listen, Canada, I can get my videos in Russia, Germany, New Zealand, England, no problem.
[01:02:33.957 --> 01:02:37.439]  About half the videos I try to send to Canada are sent back.
[01:02:38.359 --> 01:02:41.541]  And I get a letter from the government going, this is terrorist material.
[01:02:43.069 --> 01:02:48.692]  I'm not kidding!
[01:02:49.113 --> 01:02:49.613]  That's right.
[01:02:49.673 --> 01:02:51.674]  It's online, and that's why they're panicking.
[01:02:51.694 --> 01:02:52.635]  Good to hear from you, sir.
[01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:55.677]  Well, it's worth it for Canadians to try to get it.
[01:02:56.878 --> 01:03:02.322]  And, you know, we even did a test where we would give a different address and put it in unlabeled packages.
[01:03:02.422 --> 01:03:03.442]  Everyone made it right through.
[01:03:03.462 --> 01:03:04.203]  They're very lazy.
[01:03:05.419 --> 01:03:13.966]  And, uh, but, uh, no, no, they rip everything open, they inspect everything, and, oh, it says George Bush is involved in 9-11, it's Al-Qaeda!
[01:03:14.506 --> 01:03:17.509]  But then their own newspapers say that Bush is involved in 9-11.
[01:03:18.469 --> 01:03:21.171]  So it's, it's, again, that's their government, not their newspapers.
[01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:22.713]  Kind of a diverse crowd up there.
[01:03:23.273 --> 01:03:25.014]  Very serious police state in Canada.
[01:03:25.515 --> 01:03:29.418]  Oh, yeah, it's just a different brand of tyranny, a more loving, liberal tyranny.
[01:03:32.273 --> 01:03:33.895]  All right, folks, we'll come right back.
[01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:40.463]  It goes straight to Blake, Mike, Nathan, Robert, and many others on the other side.
[01:03:40.523 --> 01:03:42.265]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[01:03:42.345 --> 01:03:43.927]  And don't forget, InfoWars.net.
[01:03:44.027 --> 01:03:44.808]  InfoWars.net.
[01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:57.506]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.686 --> 01:04:02.109]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.249 --> 01:04:06.632]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.672 --> 01:04:08.033]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.814 --> 01:04:14.037]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.097 --> 01:04:21.043]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.163 --> 01:04:23.244]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.525 --> 01:04:34.033]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.173 --> 01:04:38.456]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State
[01:04:38.456 --> 01:04:40.078]  888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:53.414 --> 01:05:02.479]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:02.739 --> 01:05:13.965]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.305 --> 01:05:20.008]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:20.268 --> 01:05:20.749]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.788 --> 01:05:50.590]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:51.870 --> 01:05:56.472]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's Liquid Quell.
[01:05:56.712 --> 01:06:05.175]  Doctor-recommended, safe, effective, affordable cholesterol control, available now at major wholesale clubs everywhere, without a prescription.
[01:06:05.355 --> 01:06:07.396]  Here's Dr. Sherry Rainwater, MD.
[01:06:07.696 --> 01:06:11.197]  I recommend Quell to my patients because it's been shown to be effective.
[01:06:11.397 --> 01:06:12.918]  And safe in reducing cholesterol.
[01:06:13.099 --> 01:06:19.405]  Quell is an easy way to improve your cholesterol profile without serious side effects in as little as six months, guaranteed.
[01:06:19.685 --> 01:06:23.909]  And Quell is safe for diabetics, gluten-free, and safe to take with prescriptions.
[01:06:24.129 --> 01:06:25.791]  Here's Cheryl Gee in California.
[01:06:26.011 --> 01:06:32.497]  Quell lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days, something I couldn't do without an exercise in two to three years.
[01:06:32.777 --> 01:06:39.340]  Gentle, fast-acting liquid quail is available at major wholesale clubs nationwide and online at quaildirect.com.
[01:06:39.480 --> 01:06:43.082]  Quail your cholesterol today, risk-free and guaranteed.
[01:06:43.562 --> 01:06:46.403]  These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
[01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:49.745]  Quail is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:06:49.945 --> 01:06:51.165]  Individual results may vary.
[01:06:53.386 --> 01:06:55.587]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.148 --> 01:06:58.949]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.613 --> 01:07:13.035]  All right, eight minutes, 18 seconds into this second hour.
[01:07:13.095 --> 01:07:15.916]  Paul Watson's going to be joining us coming up with a huge news blitz.
[01:07:16.577 --> 01:07:20.099]  A ton of vital news and information in about 22 minutes.
[01:07:20.119 --> 01:07:28.423]  You know, I said I got a lot of your calls, and we did do that in the first hour, but not as fast as I'd like to, because all the callers bring up such important points.
[01:07:29.835 --> 01:07:30.835]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:07:50.191 --> 01:07:52.492]  Hey, I wanted to say thank you for everything you do.
[01:07:52.512 --> 01:07:53.812]  I appreciate it.
[01:07:53.932 --> 01:07:54.852]  Please don't thank me.
[01:07:54.912 --> 01:07:57.293]  I mean, the die is cast, my course is set.
[01:07:57.833 --> 01:08:01.134]  No, no, I mean, I appreciate you getting the information out there.
[01:08:01.174 --> 01:08:03.355]  Well, I appreciate you, sir.
[01:08:03.395 --> 01:08:04.375]  You do a lot to help.
[01:08:04.475 --> 01:08:11.157]  But I was going to call and say, first off, real quick, your video, your new video of martial law is great.
[01:08:11.838 --> 01:08:18.400]  A friend of mine and I are going to make a bunch of copies and hand it out on the drag so we can actually get some students involved in this.
[01:08:18.460 --> 01:08:19.880]  I really appreciate you doing that.
[01:08:20.327 --> 01:08:22.628]  Doesn't seem like there's enough kids involved in this, you know.
[01:08:23.389 --> 01:08:33.554]  But also, yeah, I was going to call mainly about this psychological testing, the SB 2572, is that it?
[01:08:33.834 --> 01:08:38.417]  Yes, the New Freedom Initiative Enabling Clause, now going through the Texas legislature.
[01:08:38.817 --> 01:08:47.262]  Yeah, yeah, I've been listening on and off in my car this morning, and I wanted to know if you had the numbers so that we could...
[01:08:50.525 --> 01:08:53.868]  I don't have the number in front of me.
[01:08:53.888 --> 01:09:06.778]  I had Dr. Breeding on who's leading the charge against it on Monday, but they're scheduled to be voting on it today, I think in the next few hours.
[01:09:07.118 --> 01:09:08.119]  Yeah, that's what I wanted.
[01:09:08.299 --> 01:09:14.044]  Well, basically, you can call information or go into the phone, but you can get the phone number for the Texas Legislature.
[01:09:14.853 --> 01:09:19.554]  And then you can call and ask for your state senator or your state legislator.
[01:09:20.935 --> 01:09:21.295]  Okay.
[01:09:22.135 --> 01:09:22.735]  All right, great.
[01:09:22.815 --> 01:09:25.176]  Well, that's all I had, so thank you very much.
[01:09:25.396 --> 01:09:25.856]  Thank you.
[01:09:26.576 --> 01:09:38.399]  Folks, can you believe we're actually sitting here talking about having to fight legislation for forced psychological testing and drugging for anybody that goes to public school, who gets welfare, who goes to private schools?
[01:09:38.479 --> 01:09:39.059]  It's everything.
[01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:41.260]  Right up...
[01:09:42.367 --> 01:09:47.828]  Even forcibly testing all pregnant women with the CPS right there, just looking for a reason to grab your child.
[01:09:49.909 --> 01:09:54.650]  I mean, this is the, quote, Soviet Nazi-style takeover.
[01:09:56.371 --> 01:10:00.652]  It's the quintessential opposite of freedom.
[01:10:02.772 --> 01:10:03.492]  It's unbelievable.
[01:10:04.773 --> 01:10:07.793]  And it passed the federal government just a few months ago, late 2004.
[01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:14.002]  About six months ago, and now it's already being implemented across the nation.
[01:10:14.302 --> 01:10:17.624]  We're beating it in many different states, but not in Minnesota, not in Illinois.
[01:10:17.844 --> 01:10:25.109]  They passed it, and now every woman that goes in to have a baby, GPS comes in, forcibly psychologically tested, or the woman acts upset by it.
[01:10:25.589 --> 01:10:26.790]  Oh, you must be mentally ill.
[01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:27.871]  They snatch the child.
[01:10:30.092 --> 01:10:31.693]  It's unbelievably criminal.
[01:10:32.874 --> 01:10:33.894]  Good point, Dollar.
[01:10:34.995 --> 01:10:36.376]  Sorry, I don't have that number in front of me here.
[01:10:37.603 --> 01:10:40.424]  Well, they've been playing it at nauseam on the local stations.
[01:10:41.524 --> 01:10:47.246]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Arizona.
[01:10:47.306 --> 01:10:48.027]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:10:48.047 --> 01:10:49.047]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:10:49.367 --> 01:10:50.428]  Hello.
[01:10:51.228 --> 01:10:53.389]  A previous caller asked about McCarthy.
[01:10:53.409 --> 01:10:54.509]  It was McCarthy.
[01:10:56.270 --> 01:11:05.713]  McCarthy succeeded in chasing out over 100, and I want to say over 200, employees in the State Department.
[01:11:06.109 --> 01:11:09.691]  Who didn't want to face questioning before Congress under oath.
[01:11:10.751 --> 01:11:13.773]  And that was a significant accomplishment in itself.
[01:11:14.913 --> 01:11:27.659]  Unfortunately, after the pillorying that McCarthy received by the press, after he was denounced very theatrically in Congress... By the Secretary of the Army!
[01:11:28.059 --> 01:11:28.319]  Right.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:31.501]  That assured that there would be no further
[01:11:32.585 --> 01:11:35.707]  House Un-American Activities Committee.
[01:11:35.747 --> 01:11:41.510]  But so we can understand, because new listeners, I'm sure, just joined us who weren't listening 45 minutes ago.
[01:11:42.191 --> 01:11:46.613]  When I went over this, number one, Mike, do you agree with my analysis on McCarthy?
[01:11:46.633 --> 01:11:57.419]  Number two, would you restate that and give us your view so people don't think that we're just sitting here supporting the public view of McCarthy, but supporting his real actions?
[01:11:58.090 --> 01:11:58.470]  Absolutely.
[01:11:58.510 --> 01:12:00.092]  McCarthy was a good American.
[01:12:00.112 --> 01:12:04.555]  He had his demons like we all do, alcohol being one of them.
[01:12:05.696 --> 01:12:13.882]  He was not sophisticated in his understanding, and you can understand that considering this was, as I recall, the early 50s.
[01:12:14.162 --> 01:12:15.443]  You didn't have a John Birch Society.
[01:12:15.463 --> 01:12:18.665]  You didn't have anyone trying to educate people out there.
[01:12:20.026 --> 01:12:26.311]  He had discovered this pretty much on his own, the heavy communist infiltration in his own government.
[01:12:27.299 --> 01:12:33.002]  And he just ran up against a brick wall in the Washington establishment.
[01:12:33.042 --> 01:12:44.509]  Well, they loved him whenever it could be used as a police state tool, but as soon as he found out that it was our own government, the Army, funding Stalin, funding all of this, which is now all public knowledge.
[01:12:45.109 --> 01:12:46.810]  The Soviet documents have been released.
[01:12:46.830 --> 01:12:48.531]  You know, the headline, McCarthy was right.
[01:12:48.551 --> 01:12:50.392]  That's even been in the Washington Post.
[01:12:51.588 --> 01:12:52.309]  It was real.
[01:12:52.349 --> 01:12:59.175]  The problem is, again, they built up the enemy to then turn America into a police state in the name of countering that enemy.
[01:12:59.555 --> 01:13:03.198]  And it's the same thing that Europe now plays the good cop, we play the part of the bad cop.
[01:13:03.539 --> 01:13:06.822]  Then we played the part of the good cop, they played the part of the bad cop.
[01:13:07.422 --> 01:13:13.588]  And they're willing to admit that now under the pretext of, well, there's no more communism.
[01:13:13.608 --> 01:13:14.809]  Communism has gone away.
[01:13:15.376 --> 01:13:16.637]  Well, you know, nonsense.
[01:13:16.757 --> 01:13:19.018]  Yeah, the Red Stars are all back on the tanks.
[01:13:20.359 --> 01:13:27.443]  The only difference is our CEOs go and celebrate 50 years of Mao, 50 years, you know, four years ago at Tiananmen Square.
[01:13:27.603 --> 01:13:27.984]  That's right.
[01:13:28.324 --> 01:13:36.689]  And not only has there not been another McCarthy-type investigation, there's not been another Reese Committee-type investigation.
[01:13:36.809 --> 01:13:37.930]  Or Church Committee.
[01:13:38.070 --> 01:13:39.991]  Of the tax exempt foundations, the...
[01:13:40.623 --> 01:13:48.709]  Ford and Rockefeller and Carnegie Foundations, which have financed the communists and other subversives in this country for decades, and still do.
[01:13:48.769 --> 01:13:54.573]  They're financing the Lorasas and these other organizations that are not grassroots Mexican organizations.
[01:13:54.613 --> 01:13:58.035]  They are funded primarily by the U.S.
[01:13:58.075 --> 01:14:02.418]  government grants and by Ford and Rockefeller Foundation grants.
[01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:03.399]  And that's all public.
[01:14:03.659 --> 01:14:04.400]  Yeah.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.681]  Hey, I wanted to, on another note...
[01:14:06.702 --> 01:14:10.824]  I notice you're going to be on Charles Goyette's show tomorrow morning.
[01:14:11.744 --> 01:14:13.925]  I don't know what time that is.
[01:14:14.785 --> 01:14:16.226]  Goyette just mentioned it this morning.
[01:14:16.386 --> 01:14:17.606]  I do interviews every day.
[01:14:18.867 --> 01:14:19.387]  Who is that?
[01:14:19.507 --> 01:14:20.487]  Who's Charles Goyette?
[01:14:20.687 --> 01:14:22.388]  Oh, that's Air America.
[01:14:22.588 --> 01:14:23.368]  Air America, right.
[01:14:23.448 --> 01:14:25.669]  I don't know if you've had any dealings with him.
[01:14:25.689 --> 01:14:27.109]  He's a great guy.
[01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:28.010]  He's a good partner.
[01:14:29.173 --> 01:14:31.934]  I've been on a couple of their shows.
[01:14:32.034 --> 01:14:32.974]  Very knowledgeable guy.
[01:14:32.994 --> 01:14:34.795]  He's not a lefty like the other hosts.
[01:14:35.115 --> 01:14:36.956]  I'm just amazed that they let him on there.
[01:14:37.396 --> 01:14:39.457]  But he's really pulled in a lot of listeners.
[01:14:40.217 --> 01:14:47.299]  And he got chased off of the other big talk show, radio talk show in the Valley because of his anti-war stance.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.340]  Very sophisticated understanding what goes on.
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:55.082]  He's somewhat reticent in how much he'll say.
[01:14:55.897 --> 01:14:57.218]  Well, it's also, yeah, it's syndicated.
[01:14:57.258 --> 01:14:57.378]  Right.
[01:15:17.711 --> 01:15:19.852]  So I look forward to that tomorrow.
[01:15:19.972 --> 01:15:22.053]  Yeah, no, it's just a haze of interviews.
[01:15:23.193 --> 01:15:26.915]  Last night I was so tired when I got on my TV show that I may not even put it on the web.
[01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:27.695]  I was so tired.
[01:15:28.475 --> 01:15:30.936]  I've got to pick what shows I'm going to do at this point.
[01:15:30.996 --> 01:15:32.117]  It's just getting to be crazy.
[01:15:32.457 --> 01:15:33.798]  This is a great opportunity.
[01:15:34.158 --> 01:15:35.158]  Well, I look forward to doing it.
[01:15:35.358 --> 01:15:37.239]  I'll be there tomorrow morning, 9 o'clock Central.
[01:15:37.819 --> 01:15:41.461]  That'll be 8 o'clock Mountain and 7 o'clock Pacific.
[01:15:41.761 --> 01:15:47.023]  Yeah, like I said, this is primarily a lefty, collectivist-type audience.
[01:15:48.339 --> 01:15:51.361]  But they can't get an audience, so they've got to put a libertarian on to pull the audience.
[01:15:51.581 --> 01:15:52.061]  Exactly.
[01:15:52.401 --> 01:15:55.723]  But, you know, there's a lot of people who are still stuck in the right-left paradigm.
[01:15:56.323 --> 01:15:59.724]  You know, if only we'd get rid of those darn Republicans, life would be rosy.
[01:16:00.065 --> 01:16:04.667]  And I'm going to point out to those guys that it's funny that Democrats are voting with Bush more often than the Republicans.
[01:16:04.827 --> 01:16:09.689]  Yeah, Goyette has mentioned that himself, about the 100-0 vote on the war funding.
[01:16:10.209 --> 01:16:10.929]  Real ID Act.
[01:16:10.969 --> 01:16:11.730]  Thanks for the call.
[01:16:12.110 --> 01:16:12.610]  Great points.
[01:16:12.770 --> 01:16:13.791]  Nathan in Ohio.
[01:16:13.851 --> 01:16:14.651]  Nathan, go ahead.
[01:16:15.511 --> 01:16:15.692]  Hello.
[01:16:16.112 --> 01:16:16.612]  Hello, Nathan.
[01:16:17.102 --> 01:16:18.622]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:16:18.883 --> 01:16:19.283]  Welcome.
[01:16:19.303 --> 01:16:26.244]  The Office of Homeland Security, Fatherland Security, I like to call it Corporate Financial Security.
[01:16:26.264 --> 01:16:31.746]  People need to understand that, in the very least, they're going to be negligent if we are attacked again.
[01:16:31.766 --> 01:16:39.268]  You know, out there exercising copyright law and building code violations and anything but terrorism.
[01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:40.688]  Yeah, for those who don't know, you're right.
[01:16:40.748 --> 01:16:42.409]  Building, abetting...
[01:16:43.679 --> 01:16:46.700]  Rubik's Cubes, an ounce of marijuana.
[01:16:47.061 --> 01:16:50.762]  This is what Homeland Security deals with, and they order the border to stand down.
[01:16:51.602 --> 01:17:04.848]  Okay, one other thing I wanted to address was, I read a couple years ago how the federal government was putting out ads for appeals and draft board positions, and that they would be fully staffed by June of 2005.
[01:17:05.668 --> 01:17:09.290]  And then I noticed in the press, I believe it was the CIA leaked
[01:17:10.496 --> 01:17:19.866]  Well, that has been in the mainstream news.
[01:17:19.906 --> 01:17:21.768]  They did set up the draft boards again.
[01:17:21.808 --> 01:17:23.169]  They are saying they need a draft.
[01:17:23.189 --> 01:17:24.390]  The military is falling apart.
[01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:28.915]  Their recruiting is imploding over 40%, even with lowered hurdles.
[01:17:29.815 --> 01:17:32.595]  They lowered the numbers they wanted and couldn't even get that.
[01:17:33.516 --> 01:17:36.496]  And I don't know if they're going into Iran.
[01:17:36.536 --> 01:17:40.277]  They were going to go in in 2002 into Iraq, but went in in 2003.
[01:17:41.157 --> 01:17:44.177]  But they're going to fuel that reactor in late summer.
[01:17:45.018 --> 01:17:46.018]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:46.038 --> 01:17:48.398]  And Israel's saying they're going to blow it to pieces if we don't.
[01:17:48.618 --> 01:17:48.798]  Yeah.
[01:17:50.038 --> 01:17:51.179]  So I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:17:51.859 --> 01:17:59.300]  And, you know, the current Iraq insurgency and, you know, the Downing Street document, I think this is presenting as ripe an opportunity
[01:18:00.224 --> 01:18:05.207]  As ever for the Bush administration to do something like that.
[01:18:05.227 --> 01:18:11.511]  You remember when Clinton fired missiles at Osama to divert attention from the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
[01:18:11.991 --> 01:18:20.416]  To me, this is as ripe an opportunity as ever for the Bush administration.
[01:18:20.936 --> 01:18:22.557]  It looks to me like they're desperate.
[01:18:23.257 --> 01:18:25.078]  Looks to me like they're pretty desperate right now.
[01:18:25.459 --> 01:18:26.880]  But remember, they're a front group.
[01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.742]  They can be flushed down the toilet by the globalists at the drop of a hat.
[01:18:30.822 --> 01:18:37.407]  They're there to take all the heat, and then people think the whole agenda was theirs, and then they leave office, and that agenda stays in place.
[01:18:37.627 --> 01:18:37.787]  Yeah.
[01:18:38.068 --> 01:18:47.394]  And then suddenly the Democrats will love whatever the agenda is, as long as it's a Democrat, because Republicans will suddenly fight the agenda, and then, oh, if they're fighting it, it must be a good agenda.
[01:18:47.474 --> 01:18:50.576]  Just like the left fights an agenda, oh, it must be good because they're fighting it.
[01:18:50.636 --> 01:18:51.917]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[01:18:52.198 --> 01:18:52.718]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:53.675 --> 01:18:55.197]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[01:18:55.658 --> 01:18:59.964]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:19:00.365 --> 01:19:01.246]  It still is.
[01:19:01.847 --> 01:19:05.372]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:19:05.693 --> 01:19:07.495]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:19:08.036 --> 01:19:10.099]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:19:10.638 --> 01:19:14.200]  For the complete story, the highest quality precious metals, call Midas Resources.

[01:19:58.739 --> 01:20:07.067]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[01:20:07.287 --> 01:20:08.889]  More than likely, this includes you.

[01:21:56.669 --> 01:22:01.856]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:22:02.748 --> 01:22:09.632]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:22:10.693 --> 01:22:19.278]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:22:20.379 --> 01:22:28.364]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.

[01:23:18.520 --> 01:23:19.381]  Robert, go ahead.
[01:23:19.901 --> 01:23:20.682]  Yeah, good morning, Alex.
[01:23:20.702 --> 01:23:21.562]  Thanks for my call.
[01:23:21.582 --> 01:23:22.143]  Appreciate it.
[01:23:22.483 --> 01:23:24.424]  A couple quick items, my mate.
[01:23:24.845 --> 01:23:30.769]  Listening to George Nury one night last week, he mentioned something about an upcoming 9-1-1 roundtable.
[01:23:30.849 --> 01:23:31.169]  Are you
[01:23:33.268 --> 01:23:35.590]  Are you aware of that in the near future?
[01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:36.250]  Yes, I am.
[01:23:36.270 --> 01:23:37.791]  Do you know when that's going to be?
[01:23:39.552 --> 01:23:41.134]  It's tentative, so I don't want to say the date.
[01:23:41.914 --> 01:23:44.036]  Okay, but it is just around the corner?
[01:23:45.897 --> 01:23:55.443]  Again, they cover whatever is really hot news, so if something comes up, it's not that I'm not at liberty to say, they're not sure.
[01:23:55.564 --> 01:23:56.884]  I have a ballpark.
[01:23:57.845 --> 01:23:58.145]  Oh, I see.
[01:23:58.165 --> 01:23:58.966]  You're just waiting on them.
[01:23:59.066 --> 01:23:59.766]  Okay, fair enough.
[01:24:00.147 --> 01:24:01.848]  But I'm told it's going to be coming up.
[01:24:02.378 --> 01:24:04.899]  Okay, I'll just stay by the channel and listen to that then.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:16.664]  I've read in today's Denver Post, that was actually on the news last night as well, that Berksh Hathaway, the guy who owned it just went blank.
[01:24:17.504 --> 01:24:22.066]  Lauren Buffett, Oracle of Omaha.
[01:24:22.386 --> 01:24:23.686]  Yeah, and thank you.
[01:24:23.947 --> 01:24:27.508]  He just bought Pacific Corp., a big energy company out of California.
[01:24:28.658 --> 01:24:31.881]  Is there anything to that, or is that just a rich guy trying to make himself richer?
[01:24:31.921 --> 01:24:33.282]  Well, no, there's a lot to it.
[01:24:33.463 --> 01:24:44.132]  Arnold was involved with Enron, and Malkin, the junk bond dealer they met in secret, decided how to blame it on Cruz Bustamante, who I can't stand, folks, but facts are facts.
[01:24:44.593 --> 01:24:48.296]  Bustamante and Davis were not involved in the energy scamming.
[01:24:48.336 --> 01:24:49.417]  They tried to stop it.
[01:24:49.838 --> 01:24:52.300]  It was blamed on them, and the people who were involved in it
[01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:53.421]  We're good to go.
[01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:08.901]  Beck, tell them the rest of it.
[01:25:10.122 --> 01:25:15.405]  And also, Berkshire Hathaway, which is an agent on Lord Rothschild, and that's mainstream news.
[01:25:16.366 --> 01:25:22.030]  So, now that he owns it, he controls a big chunk of the electricity in the state of California, basically.
[01:25:22.210 --> 01:25:27.413]  Yeah, Arnold came into office going, and they stole $9 billion, and they're bad, and I'm going to get them.
[01:25:27.834 --> 01:25:31.616]  Meanwhile, he was involved in deciding how to cover that up and get control.
[01:25:31.956 --> 01:25:32.977]  I mean, it's such a joke.
[01:25:33.607 --> 01:25:33.847]  Wow.
[01:25:34.548 --> 01:25:35.128]  One last thing.
[01:25:35.208 --> 01:25:36.609]  As you know, the U.S.
[01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:39.571]  Congress is battling over stem cell research.
[01:25:39.691 --> 01:25:41.873]  I was wondering what your feelings were about that.
[01:25:41.973 --> 01:25:43.954]  It could take an hour to go over, but thanks for the call.
[01:25:44.435 --> 01:25:45.775]  It's total smoke and mirrors.
[01:25:45.856 --> 01:25:48.778]  Bush took almost all the restrictions off stem cells.
[01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:50.659]  Massive federal funding.
[01:25:51.354 --> 01:26:06.382]  And then we'll give speeches about how he's against it, and they use scientific terms and confuse people, and then Congress passes, a supposed conservative Congress, passes big funding for fetal stem cells, then Bush says he'll strike it down, so they're going to change it.
[01:26:06.462 --> 01:26:10.845]  Number one, fetal stem cells are so unstable, they're not good for research.
[01:26:10.905 --> 01:26:20.690]  It's not just that adult stem cells are as good, the majority of top bio-engineering scientists say that adult stem cells are better
[01:26:21.795 --> 01:26:24.376]  Very stable and can be manipulated much easier.
[01:26:25.216 --> 01:26:28.597]  But they want to market for all these dead babies, and so they're trying to create one.
[01:26:30.298 --> 01:26:32.279]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Texas.
[01:26:32.319 --> 01:26:33.039]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:26:33.379 --> 01:26:33.779]  Hey, Alex.
[01:26:33.819 --> 01:26:34.759]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:35.400]  You bet.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:50.525]  Hey, talking about the New World Order, as we speak right now in a small little town that I live in in Texas, we've got probably what I call two busloads of foreign military officers, all from different areas, because...
[01:26:51.508 --> 01:26:58.173]  I got a big article about that, with foreign troops, local police, Marines, and Army practicing a takeover of Maryland.
[01:26:58.233 --> 01:26:59.074]  I've got that in front of me.
[01:26:59.594 --> 01:27:08.281]  Well, I was driving home, and so I saw a group of them just doing their tourist kind of attitude, because we have the Nimitz Museum up here in Fredericksburg.
[01:27:08.881 --> 01:27:12.123]  If people want a taste of the New World Order, they can go over there right now, and they're going to see them.
[01:27:12.544 --> 01:27:14.245]  They're probably going to stop at Mr. Gaddy's for lunch.
[01:27:14.265 --> 01:27:15.826]  It seems to be their favorite place when they do.
[01:27:15.966 --> 01:27:17.107]  Yeah, they're always coming through.
[01:27:17.127 --> 01:27:17.407]  Yeah, they are.
[01:27:18.752 --> 01:27:21.434]  Yeah, they always do that tour.
[01:27:21.594 --> 01:27:22.795]  So I stopped, got out of my truck.
[01:27:22.815 --> 01:27:23.655]  You're in Fredericksburg.
[01:27:23.815 --> 01:27:24.155]  Yes, sir.
[01:27:24.576 --> 01:27:27.598]  I stopped, got out of my truck, and walked up to a group of five of them.
[01:27:27.978 --> 01:27:31.720]  And they're all officers, and they're all wearing their camouflage uniforms.
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:33.541]  Let me guess, were they German and Czech?
[01:27:34.182 --> 01:27:37.724]  Well, no, they were all like, I asked them, and there was El Salvador, Thailand.
[01:27:38.044 --> 01:27:40.986]  One was from Pakistan, with a big smile on his face.
[01:27:41.921 --> 01:27:43.122]  And the others didn't.
[01:27:43.142 --> 01:27:46.726]  They could tell I was, you know, because when I started asking them questions, what are you all doing here?
[01:27:46.786 --> 01:27:47.606]  And, you know, they didn't.
[01:27:48.107 --> 01:27:48.908]  Some kept quiet.
[01:27:48.928 --> 01:27:51.030]  The others said, well, we're all here.
[01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:52.391]  We're all on our own little thing.
[01:27:52.451 --> 01:27:53.772]  But I asked one, how long have you been here?
[01:27:53.812 --> 01:27:55.053]  He said, I've been here about two months.
[01:27:55.714 --> 01:27:57.956]  And the others said, well, what are you all doing here?
[01:27:57.976 --> 01:27:59.377]  Well, we're really here to learn English.
[01:28:00.478 --> 01:28:07.565]  And I guess what really irritated me more than anything is that I was in the Marine Corps, and I did my four years honorable discharge.
[01:28:08.422 --> 01:28:09.803]  And it's all part of the desynthesization campaign.
[01:28:09.963 --> 01:28:10.143]  Sure.
[01:28:35.073 --> 01:28:36.414]  It just blew me away.
[01:28:36.494 --> 01:28:37.035]  Anything else?
[01:28:37.335 --> 01:28:39.177]  Well, one was carrying his camera.
[01:28:39.197 --> 01:28:39.878]  Stay there.
[01:28:40.018 --> 01:28:42.601]  We'll hear the rest of the story.
[01:28:43.662 --> 01:28:44.603]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.063 --> 01:28:46.665]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.566 --> 01:28:50.269]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.593 --> 01:28:55.935]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.195 --> 01:29:00.039]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:29:00.339 --> 01:29:01.180]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:05.724]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:05.944 --> 01:29:10.127]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.508 --> 01:29:15.392]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:15.772 --> 01:29:19.354]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.534 --> 01:29:24.877]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:25.157 --> 01:29:27.878]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[01:30:52.395 --> 01:30:55.777]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[01:32:01.269 --> 01:32:02.750]  We're about to go to Paul Watson.
[01:32:02.850 --> 01:32:04.351]  A ton of news and more of your calls.
[01:32:04.411 --> 01:32:13.176]  But since Stephen in Fredericksburg, Texas called in about it, here is the USJFCOM, US Joint Forces Command.
[01:32:14.542 --> 01:32:15.002]  And U.S.
[01:32:15.042 --> 01:32:17.364]  Marine Corps co-sponsored Joint Urban Warrior 05.
[01:32:17.484 --> 01:32:19.165]  Again, I've been to two of these.
[01:32:19.606 --> 01:32:19.826]  U.S.
[01:32:19.866 --> 01:32:21.247]  Joint Forces Command and the U.S.
[01:32:21.267 --> 01:32:31.954]  Marine Corps are set to co-sponsor the second Joint Urban Warrior Seminar War Game through May 26 at the Bulger Center in Potomac, Maryland.
[01:32:31.974 --> 01:32:35.116]  And again, folks, they've been having these joint drills.
[01:32:35.917 --> 01:32:37.738]  I've been to two of them, so it's not their second.
[01:32:37.758 --> 01:32:40.440]  Maybe it's the second of some new configuration.
[01:32:41.303 --> 01:32:48.208]  This was released by J-O-1, S-W-A-W, Chris Hoffpower, U.S.
[01:32:48.228 --> 01:32:49.829]  Joint Forces Command Public Affairs.
[01:32:50.570 --> 01:32:52.371]  I remember it used to be Mr. Jones over there.
[01:32:52.992 --> 01:32:57.415]  You'd go to one of these things, man, and they'd let all the other mainstream media film whatever they wanted.
[01:32:57.435 --> 01:32:58.456]  But I had press passes.
[01:32:58.476 --> 01:32:59.617]  They had to let me into these drills.
[01:33:00.798 --> 01:33:03.159]  And they would just try to tell us to turn our cameras off.
[01:33:03.179 --> 01:33:03.820]  They'd get mad.
[01:33:04.200 --> 01:33:06.382]  But I'd sneak around and get past them.
[01:33:06.402 --> 01:33:09.084]  We'd send in one of our reporters in with another group.
[01:33:09.679 --> 01:33:11.960]  And then they'd let them videotape the interrogations.
[01:33:11.980 --> 01:33:13.221]  Where'd you get the helmet and the gun?
[01:33:13.801 --> 01:33:14.922]  I got it in San Francisco.
[01:33:15.663 --> 01:33:18.204]  What militia are you with?
[01:33:18.244 --> 01:33:19.064]  Who's your mayor?
[01:33:19.885 --> 01:33:22.086]  And practicing the gun confiscations.
[01:33:22.106 --> 01:33:24.428]  They practice breaking up families, taking your children.
[01:33:25.708 --> 01:33:27.870]  They tell you no resistance will be tolerated.
[01:33:28.550 --> 01:33:32.993]  And then they admit, I got Colonel Love admitting it's for domestic operations with the local police.
[01:33:33.453 --> 01:33:36.955]  But then on the local news, it's their training to fight overseas.
[01:33:37.455 --> 01:33:38.856]  Of course, they have foreign troops with them.
[01:33:40.543 --> 01:33:42.024]  And the role players, I'm an American!
[01:33:42.064 --> 01:33:42.784]  This is America!
[01:33:42.844 --> 01:33:43.364]  No!
[01:33:43.704 --> 01:33:47.906]  And the Germans go, you know, with their blanks.
[01:33:47.966 --> 01:33:50.207]  And the Americans go, and fall on the ground.
[01:33:52.767 --> 01:33:55.629]  That's just running around screaming explosions, helicopters.
[01:33:56.529 --> 01:33:57.329]  This is America!
[01:33:57.369 --> 01:33:58.390]  No, not my children!
[01:33:58.450 --> 01:34:00.170]  No, not them, please!
[01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:02.271]  And it's just so nice.
[01:34:02.291 --> 01:34:04.412]  It's been going on for over a decade.
[01:34:04.432 --> 01:34:05.832]  A video from 1995-96 at Fort Polk.
[01:34:08.365 --> 01:34:11.707]  With the Czech Republic and Russian trips and others, and they have role players.
[01:34:11.767 --> 01:34:12.407]  I'm an American!
[01:34:12.587 --> 01:34:15.209]  No, not the camp, please!
[01:34:15.489 --> 01:34:17.210]  It's just your friendly government, folks.
[01:34:17.230 --> 01:34:18.891]  They really care about you.
[01:34:19.511 --> 01:34:20.372]  You should trust them.
[01:34:20.992 --> 01:34:22.593]  So let's watch Steve finish up real quick.
[01:34:22.613 --> 01:34:24.734]  So these foreign trips who are constantly getting tours...
[01:34:25.565 --> 01:34:26.365]  Oh, yeah.
[01:34:26.425 --> 01:34:31.827]  And a lot of it is officer exchange program and training and stuff, but it's all part of this just continual merger.
[01:34:31.847 --> 01:34:32.227]  Go ahead.
[01:34:32.307 --> 01:34:32.787]  Right, yeah.
[01:34:33.167 --> 01:34:39.989]  I'm sure that's what it is, but I guess what's irritating me is the fact that they're wearing their... They're in battle uniform, they're in battle fatigue, so one of them's got a camera.
[01:34:40.029 --> 01:34:40.629]  What'd you say to him?
[01:34:41.189 --> 01:34:43.769]  Well, one had a camera, and I asked him.
[01:34:43.810 --> 01:34:46.050]  He was the one that was from El Salvador.
[01:34:46.850 --> 01:34:48.511]  No, Thailand, excuse me.
[01:34:49.211 --> 01:34:49.711]  And he...
[01:34:50.675 --> 01:34:52.637]  I just said, you know, this is your fighting uniform.
[01:34:52.657 --> 01:34:54.018]  You're here to fight Americans?
[01:34:54.099 --> 01:34:56.040]  And he put his two fingers, because he's English, not so good.
[01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:58.182]  He put his two fingers, oh, America and Thailand, we're like this.
[01:34:58.223 --> 01:34:59.043]  We're real close, you know.
[01:34:59.504 --> 01:35:05.910]  I said, but, you know, I was in the Marine Corps, and we couldn't leave our base wearing our camouflage fatigues, you know, because that's for fighting.
[01:35:06.010 --> 01:35:07.612]  And the only time you wore that was you were on base.
[01:35:07.832 --> 01:35:11.976]  And if you got off base, you either wore your civilian clothes or you wore your dress uniform.
[01:35:12.566 --> 01:35:18.052]  And I know our Army allows their men to go off base with their camos, which I think is kind of sloppy, but they do that.
[01:35:18.232 --> 01:35:20.354]  Well, sloppiness is the new specialty.
[01:35:20.814 --> 01:35:34.268]  But I'm sure you heard about all the police-killing troops up around Fort Bragg, because now they do drills 50 miles away where troops try to take over police cars and police stations, and the cops think it's terrorists and kill them.
[01:35:35.246 --> 01:35:36.027]  You didn't hear about that?
[01:35:36.087 --> 01:35:36.968]  No, I haven't heard that.
[01:35:36.988 --> 01:35:40.051]  There were two cases just two years ago.
[01:35:40.071 --> 01:35:41.072]  There have been some other cases.
[01:35:41.612 --> 01:35:44.695]  Because they're practicing, sir, taking over the cities.
[01:35:44.936 --> 01:35:47.258]  I'm not kidding.
[01:35:47.694 --> 01:35:48.834]  Yeah.
[01:35:49.054 --> 01:35:50.474]  Can I change the subject real quick?
[01:35:50.835 --> 01:35:54.575]  Last Friday, I think, you were talking about the Mexican flag.
[01:35:54.595 --> 01:35:56.295]  I think the issue came up about the Mexican flag.
[01:35:56.576 --> 01:36:00.816]  Yeah, that was up in Wisconsin, flying it above the American flag at the government building.
[01:36:00.836 --> 01:36:10.298]  Well, what's wonderful here in our Fredericksburg High School, as you drive right past it in the evening, lit up bright and clear as day, because it's at night, you can see it.
[01:36:10.678 --> 01:36:17.059]  They have the Mexican flag mounted on the inside, of course, but it's facing out, so when you see it, you know it's the Mexican flag, and it's all lit up.
[01:36:17.802 --> 01:36:19.631]  Nice pretty little display of the Mexican flag.
[01:36:20.053 --> 01:36:22.222]  I was wondering why that's there when there's no other flags that...
[01:36:23.202 --> 01:36:25.363]  Because it's about a red carpet.
[01:36:25.643 --> 01:36:38.508]  They get more health care, more tuition, free housing, doesn't matter how many diseases, leprosy, drug-resistant TB, whooping cough, incredibly deadly strains of meningitis.
[01:36:39.068 --> 01:36:48.111]  It's all about driving down the wages, a red carpet, that the American flag is not allowed to be flown in five South Texas towns, no English is allowed, the feds love it.
[01:36:48.624 --> 01:36:54.571]  What's amazing is when I bring that up to people in this town, I ask, what do you think about that Mexican flag there displayed inside the school building there?
[01:36:55.071 --> 01:36:59.816]  I think it's the library, maybe the offices, I'm not real sure, but it's right along the highway there.
[01:37:00.537 --> 01:37:02.359]  And they're like, oh, I don't see it.
[01:37:02.399 --> 01:37:02.599]  What?
[01:37:02.619 --> 01:37:04.401]  You know, they don't know anything about it.
[01:37:04.421 --> 01:37:05.242]  I don't see it!
[01:37:05.382 --> 01:37:06.163]  Yeah, I know.
[01:37:06.183 --> 01:37:07.164]  Thanks for the call.
[01:37:07.184 --> 01:37:08.005]  Yeah, good points.
[01:37:08.065 --> 01:37:10.548]  Paul Watson, thanks for holding during that last little diatribe.
[01:37:12.105 --> 01:37:13.146]  Good to be here, Alex.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:44.087]  You had troops, the BBC reported, all over Scotland from the Ukraine, screaming at families at gunpoint and searching vehicles, and part of some government operation.
[01:37:44.127 --> 01:37:51.632]  The Scots, though, were a little more angry about it than Americans, the thumb-sucking slaves we are.
[01:37:52.152 --> 01:37:54.234]  They got pretty mad about the troops, didn't they?
[01:37:55.197 --> 01:37:57.578]  Yeah, I believe there was an investigation into it.
[01:37:58.619 --> 01:38:03.402]  Ukrainian troops just randomly setting up checkpoints in Scotland, pulling people out of their cars.
[01:38:03.902 --> 01:38:05.383]  All of this psychological testing?
[01:38:06.204 --> 01:38:06.644]  Exactly.
[01:38:06.684 --> 01:38:07.604]  I mean, that's the case.
[01:38:07.724 --> 01:38:13.948]  Whether they have the guts to go ahead and run that kind of program widespread remains to be seen.
[01:38:13.968 --> 01:38:21.833]  Obviously, it's going to take a massive... And the Scots did stuff like throw things at their vehicles, scream at them, drive through checkpoints, bump their vehicles...
[01:38:22.763 --> 01:38:29.528]  And usually they're pretty docile folks, but what's wrong with... They don't like foreign troops searching their women and children?
[01:38:30.669 --> 01:38:31.709]  I mean, they may be with Al-Qaeda.
[01:38:32.430 --> 01:38:34.271]  Well, it may be a form of mental illness.
[01:38:35.012 --> 01:38:35.472]  Yes.
[01:38:35.772 --> 01:38:40.195]  They're the authority, and to question them is becoming mental illness, according to some people.
[01:38:41.256 --> 01:38:44.338]  Well, foreign troops are good, especially when they're trying to put us in camps.
[01:38:44.398 --> 01:38:45.919]  But, Paul, there's a lot of news.
[01:38:45.979 --> 01:38:49.482]  I've got a lot of news here, but in the next hour and 20 minutes, what should we cover?
[01:38:50.555 --> 01:39:00.737]  Well, obviously we need to talk about Pat Tillman, because it's another example of this carefully stage-managed production, trying to prop up the flagging war.
[01:39:01.737 --> 01:39:15.039]  And we've seen many examples of it over the past few years, which we need to go through at length, because the truth isn't good for recruitment numbers, so there's no option but to script this kind of theatre.
[01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:17.920]  Be like Pat Tillman!
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:26.544]  Yeah, I mean, which is probably one of the things that these recruiters go in schools and tell these kids, you know, we'll pay... Well, there's no probably about it.
[01:39:26.564 --> 01:39:27.744]  They had him in brochures.
[01:39:28.524 --> 01:39:30.485]  Be like Private Lynch.
[01:39:31.906 --> 01:39:44.672]  Exactly, and I mean, it goes back after the whole weapons of mass destruction lie, which is, you know, a three-hour program in itself, to the day Baghdad fell with the toppling of the Saddam statue.
[01:39:46.091 --> 01:39:49.313]  An incident which the Army now admits was staged.
[01:39:49.813 --> 01:39:53.116]  They came out and admitted it in the LA Times last year.
[01:39:54.417 --> 01:40:10.409]  Basically what happened is they had a few dozen of the internationally thought criminal arm and shalabi's free Iraqi forces militia flown in by the Pentagon and exactly on cue as the broadcast went out worldwide.
[01:40:11.010 --> 01:40:15.492]  They all rushed to the center of the square and pulled down the statue.
[01:40:15.512 --> 01:40:20.253]  But it backfired because Shalibi's number two and number three men were leading it, yelling in the cameras.
[01:40:21.234 --> 01:40:25.955]  Yeah, that's right, and they were identified via the photographs as being part of his militia.
[01:40:26.815 --> 01:40:33.378]  And all the camera angles were close up on the crowd, so it looked like there could have been thousands rather.
[01:40:33.398 --> 01:40:35.999]  But if you back off, it's like 20 guys and maybe 100 onlookers.
[01:40:37.788 --> 01:40:41.130]  Exactly, and the wider angle shots were never broadcast.
[01:40:42.010 --> 01:40:50.936]  So, you know, in this country as well, cue righteous indignation from the neocons, look, we liberated them and the media peddle it forevermore.
[01:40:51.836 --> 01:41:00.781]  That was the first stage, and it came out in the LA Times that yes, it was staged, the whole point of the American flag on, exchanging it with the Iraqi flag, all scripted.
[01:41:02.162 --> 01:41:05.023]  The capture of Saddam Hussein in December 2003.
[01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:09.573]  Kurds admitted that they had caught him weeks before.
[01:41:10.654 --> 01:41:19.302]  Congressmen beforehand, like Congressman LaHood, were bragging about how he was going to be caught in the next couple of weeks, and then he was.
[01:41:20.863 --> 01:41:27.289]  And then we had this CNN film where General Kimmett very carefully tells his troops,
[01:41:28.140 --> 01:41:32.602]  You know, what had just happened, even though they were the ones who had supposedly captured him.
[01:41:32.622 --> 01:41:34.343]  Don't tell anybody anything.
[01:41:34.403 --> 01:41:35.824]  Here is your official story.
[01:41:36.124 --> 01:41:37.665]  Now let's repeat it three times.
[01:41:37.985 --> 01:41:39.546]  In fact, that's in the computer, guys.
[01:41:40.126 --> 01:41:43.308]  I don't know what we named it, but it says Saddam captured General Kimmett.
[01:41:43.328 --> 01:41:43.888]  Can you find that?
[01:41:44.908 --> 01:41:49.711]  So it's basically him repeating the story to them, telling them what happened, you know.
[01:41:50.365 --> 01:41:52.326]  We literally found him hiding in a hole.
[01:41:52.386 --> 01:41:53.187]  Do you got it?
[01:41:53.247 --> 01:41:54.548]  Don't say anything else.
[01:41:54.868 --> 01:41:55.768]  That's the story.
[01:41:55.788 --> 01:41:56.589]  In a hole.
[01:41:56.889 --> 01:41:57.669]  Do you got it?
[01:41:58.050 --> 01:42:02.152]  He's obviously relating the cover story, which we knew was the cover story.
[01:42:02.252 --> 01:42:05.354]  And later it came out that he had been captured a month before and it was all staged.
[01:42:06.335 --> 01:42:08.016]  Yeah, so that was another example.
[01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:18.242]  Identical fake letters written by the Pentagon, supposedly from soldiers in Iraq, saying how great the war is going.
[01:42:20.484 --> 01:42:22.785]  Published in hundreds of newspapers.
[01:42:23.666 --> 01:42:25.067]  All signatures, everything.
[01:42:26.308 --> 01:42:30.330]  We're fed the best food.
[01:42:30.370 --> 01:42:31.451]  The Iraqis love us.
[01:42:31.771 --> 01:42:32.992]  Things are going well here.
[01:42:35.033 --> 01:42:41.637]  Roomfuls of bodies, supposedly evidence of Saddam's mass graves, when in reality...
[01:42:42.273 --> 01:42:47.318]  They're part of an Iranian-Iraqi war remains exchange program.
[01:42:47.578 --> 01:42:55.625]  That's why it was skeletons in big containers of sand, just like when we get people back from the Korean or Vietnam War.
[01:42:56.746 --> 01:43:02.491]  Yeah, but on every Murdoch-owned newspaper in the world, from Britain to Australia to the U.S.,
[01:43:03.237 --> 01:43:06.618]  Saddam's torture chamber, you know, Saddam's mass grave.
[01:43:07.118 --> 01:43:12.439]  And this was... It turned out it had been UN-inspected in 92, and the US had been there, that's why they ran there first.
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:20.061]  Yeah, the follow-up story, admitting it was an exchange program, was little mentioned.
[01:43:20.121 --> 01:43:21.562]  It was back in the newspaper.
[01:43:22.562 --> 01:43:30.824]  And then here in Britain, and that was back in, I believe, early April, just when it was starting to flag they needed to prop up the support.
[01:43:32.256 --> 01:43:39.541]  In Britain, Tony Blair goes on television, denounces the execution of Luke Alsop by the brutal Iraqis.
[01:43:40.562 --> 01:43:52.750]  He whips up patriotic fervour, you know, re-energises the country to get back behind the war after we had these massive, million-strong people marching in anti-war marches in London.
[01:43:53.504 --> 01:43:57.005]  Turns out that Luke Alsop died in combat.
[01:43:57.085 --> 01:44:00.686]  The execution story was a completely manufactured fairy tale.
[01:44:01.086 --> 01:44:03.946]  But if that's not enough for people, they'll really cut Nick Berg's head off.
[01:44:05.286 --> 01:44:08.687]  Oh, yeah, which, I mean, some have speculated might have happened with Tillman.
[01:44:09.247 --> 01:44:12.408]  But, I mean, before we talk about that, obviously... But there's no speculation with Berg.
[01:44:12.468 --> 01:44:13.408]  That was totally staged.
[01:44:13.748 --> 01:44:14.128]  Well, no.
[01:44:14.588 --> 01:44:16.249]  Takes an hour to go over it, but we've done that.
[01:44:16.289 --> 01:44:20.190]  Well, there's a whole archive on it with all the stories on prisonplanet.com.
[01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:21.770]  Jessica Lynch...
[01:44:22.529 --> 01:44:24.431]  And the men cowered in fear, though.
[01:44:24.471 --> 01:44:30.996]  The real men who fought and died, and one Hispanic gentleman really did fight valiantly like Audie Murphy.
[01:44:31.516 --> 01:44:32.917]  No, no, he did nothing.
[01:44:32.977 --> 01:44:36.520]  It was all her when she really cowered in the back of the truck.
[01:44:49.710 --> 01:44:57.856]  Yeah, and the script was that, you know, the Iraqi army had doggedly defended the hospital she was in to prevent anyone from rescuing her.
[01:44:57.876 --> 01:45:03.861]  And of course the truth is that the Iraqi troops had deserted the hospital and according to
[01:45:04.668 --> 01:45:06.909]  Both Lynch and the Iraqi doctors.
[01:45:07.069 --> 01:45:09.231]  Basically, she was treated like royalty.
[01:45:09.471 --> 01:45:12.192]  But they still kicked down doors, and then it scared her.
[01:45:12.252 --> 01:45:17.435]  She hit again, beat up the doctors who two days before had said, come get her, the Republican Guard has pulled out.
[01:45:17.655 --> 01:45:24.499]  They then went and got troops that they'd put blankets over, you know, dead troops, and took the blankets off and rearranged their bodies.
[01:45:25.079 --> 01:45:26.180]  BBC reported that...
[01:45:27.722 --> 01:45:30.443]  Yeah, it was another Hollywood production.
[01:45:30.463 --> 01:45:32.444]  There was that BBC documentary which exposed all that.
[01:45:32.484 --> 01:45:39.548]  And then, subsequently, all the people involved in the rescue, some of the people anyway, and some of the people in her unit, die mysteriously.
[01:45:57.382 --> 01:46:01.387]  And Lynch obviously did the right thing because, you know, she was out in the light.
[01:46:01.407 --> 01:46:03.029]  She was public, so she was safe.
[01:46:03.330 --> 01:46:06.193]  And that's after they started going public and saying it was a fairy tale.
[01:46:07.235 --> 01:46:08.236]  Yeah.
[01:46:09.177 --> 01:46:14.324]  For examples, which we got on the website, Petty Officer First Class David N. Tapper.
[01:46:16.982 --> 01:46:29.411]  Another guy had somebody pop up from behind in L.A.
[01:46:29.431 --> 01:46:31.212]  while they were cooking hamburgers and blew his head off.
[01:46:32.113 --> 01:46:33.073]  Yeah.
[01:46:33.894 --> 01:46:38.357]  Also, Josh Daniel Spear, his car crashed into some trees for no apparent reason.
[01:46:38.397 --> 01:46:39.618]  He was part of the rescue team.
[01:46:40.478 --> 01:46:44.601]  And then the case of Kyle Edward Williams, who had got back.
[01:46:45.288 --> 01:46:45.328]  Ah!
[01:47:06.751 --> 01:47:14.938]  By the way, the news says drive-by, and in the case, the guy's cooking hamburgers, and somebody in a black mask pops up, double-taps him, and runs off.
[01:47:15.319 --> 01:47:18.361]  And this would always be a day after they'd tell the press it was lies.
[01:47:18.661 --> 01:47:22.665]  Then Lynch got smart and said, it's all fake, it's a fable, I cried, I hid.
[01:47:24.566 --> 01:47:25.067]  Exactly.
[01:47:25.807 --> 01:47:30.952]  And now we get to Pat Tillman, and there's literally a hundred other examples, folks, but we're just covering some of the lowlights here.
[01:47:31.372 --> 01:47:32.173]  Pat Tillman.
[01:47:33.494 --> 01:47:34.575]  Yeah, the original story...
[01:47:35.507 --> 01:47:38.908]  Of how he died, if you remember the scripted version.
[01:47:38.948 --> 01:47:44.071]  Charging al-Qaeda, it might have even been bin Laden, a machine gun nest, he was on his heels.
[01:47:45.051 --> 01:47:51.013]  Yeah, charging up the Pakistani hills and mountains, barking orders at his fellow troops.
[01:47:52.874 --> 01:47:56.496]  The scripted version came out at the same time as Abu Ghraib was breaking.
[01:47:57.676 --> 01:48:02.038]  Another coincidence, you know, they needed a pick-me-up to get the public back behind it.
[01:48:02.629 --> 01:48:10.854]  Now the family's saying, then the Pentagon admits that friendly fire killed him, but now evidence is coming out that fire was directed at him from higher up.
[01:48:11.214 --> 01:48:15.436]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's the bone of contention.
[01:48:15.476 --> 01:48:16.677]  Maybe it goes deeper.
[01:48:17.327 --> 01:48:19.048]  You know, maybe it wasn't friendly fire.
[01:48:19.828 --> 01:48:25.149]  Also, he was the type of guy who'd give up three million bucks a year, you know, first string football player.
[01:48:25.169 --> 01:48:30.871]  A lot of brass at that time, mid-level, was mad they weren't allowed to really go after the enemy.
[01:48:31.451 --> 01:48:33.552]  And some people are saying Tillman was complaining.
[01:48:35.093 --> 01:48:39.974]  Well, I mean, could he have been the sacrificial lamb needed to counter the Abu Ghraib scandal?
[01:48:39.994 --> 01:48:45.716]  I don't think his own unit would have, you know, executed him, but certainly an order from the top would have come down.
[01:48:47.611 --> 01:48:51.376]  Well, the family is saying now the story of how they killed him for friendly fire is alive.
[01:48:52.543 --> 01:48:54.484]  That's the latest, is it?
[01:48:54.745 --> 01:49:01.209]  But, I mean, they've lied so pervasively, and without any remorse, is it a stretch to say they'd do something like that?
[01:49:01.809 --> 01:49:04.651]  But, I mean, what's admitted is bad enough.
[01:49:04.711 --> 01:49:13.477]  Compounding the misery of a grieving family, lying to the American people is a desperate lunge to get the recruitment number back.
[01:49:13.537 --> 01:49:20.121]  And then the Pentagon, when the family found out, told them the truth, but asked them, said, please, this is for the country's morale, please lie with us.
[01:49:21.497 --> 01:49:26.779]  Yeah, I mean, we've seen it in, you know, the Let's Roll Flight 93 example.
[01:49:26.819 --> 01:49:28.040]  They do it time and time again.
[01:49:29.060 --> 01:49:33.182]  But the fact is that recruitment numbers are down 27% or more in February.
[01:49:33.622 --> 01:49:35.923]  They need to keep scripting these kind of events.
[01:49:36.103 --> 01:49:38.104]  The Army's down 42%.
[01:49:41.065 --> 01:49:45.427]  Well, maybe Pat Tillman was with Al-Qaeda and they had to deal with it.
[01:49:45.447 --> 01:49:47.287]  Anybody who they don't like is with Al-Qaeda.
[01:49:47.608 --> 01:49:49.088]  I'm being sarcastic, folks.
[01:49:49.388 --> 01:49:50.169]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:50.189 --> 01:49:50.789]  Stay with us, Paul.
[01:49:54.272 --> 01:50:01.682]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.

[01:52:55.993 --> 01:53:02.015]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.635 --> 01:53:05.596]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.237 --> 01:53:13.658]  Paul Watson, I want to come back in the next hour and go through a whole bunch of news I've got here in front of me.
[01:53:15.219 --> 01:53:17.059]  What's some of the other news items you want to cover?
[01:53:20.433 --> 01:53:26.256]  Valkyrie, Elle Valkyrie, back in the news, injured and now reportedly evacuated from Iraq.
[01:53:26.697 --> 01:53:29.658]  You can go through the history of that.
[01:53:29.919 --> 01:53:37.663]  How the American taxpayers are basically paying for the torture and execution of people in Uzbekistan.
[01:53:38.343 --> 01:53:39.724]  Want to go through that as well.
[01:53:40.885 --> 01:53:46.148]  And just a final comment on what we were talking about in the last segment.
[01:53:47.565 --> 01:53:54.428]  You know, we've got lie upon lie upon, you know, a layer of deception in this Pat Tillman case, as with the previous examples we mentioned.
[01:53:55.188 --> 01:54:08.534]  And then the government have the nerve to grandstand when Newsweek retracts this story about the Koran, desecrating the Koran, an incident which had happened and been admitted to many times previously.
[01:54:09.355 --> 01:54:14.937]  But, you know, now it didn't happen this one time, so that must mean that all the previous instances now don't exist.
[01:54:15.788 --> 01:54:30.357]  So it's like if I'm in court for murdering 51 people, I admit to murdering 50, but the 51st murder is dismissed for lack of evidence, then that automatically means the other 50 murders don't matter and I walk free.
[01:54:30.557 --> 01:54:33.119]  That's the attitude the government have got.
[01:54:33.979 --> 01:54:41.284]  And then they point the finger at others saying that reporting anything like this is inciting a backlash.
[01:54:41.992 --> 01:54:52.478]  Well, now it's the Pentagon's own internal documents about torture and desecration.
[01:54:53.999 --> 01:54:58.502]  And their own people are quitting, and their own generals are quitting and saying it, but that's all ignored.
[01:54:59.182 --> 01:55:09.809]  Paul, before we end this hour and come back with calls and then a ton of no's, did you get that link we sent you to the Jeff Rents interview in the first 30 minutes where he lavished praise on martial law?
[01:55:10.547 --> 01:55:12.769]  Yeah, it's posted on prisonplanet.com.
[01:55:13.549 --> 01:55:15.310]  Paul, again, I mean, I didn't ask Jeff to do this.
[01:55:15.350 --> 01:55:17.532]  He says it's the most powerful film he's ever seen.
[01:55:17.572 --> 01:55:18.733]  I mean, it's that good, folks.
[01:55:19.353 --> 01:55:20.374]  This is what people are saying.

[01:56:58.612 --> 01:57:03.196]  The price is still the same as it was on the first day, but the material expands and expands every day.
[01:57:04.099 --> 01:57:05.880]  Yeah, former news producer and anchorman.
[01:57:05.920 --> 01:57:12.204]  Yeah, and he's been doing, you know, what we're doing longer than we have, longer than you have even.
[01:57:27.933 --> 01:57:30.254]  Alright, folks, we'll be right back with the second hour.
[01:57:30.314 --> 01:57:31.735]  I hope you'll get Martial Law.
[01:57:31.795 --> 01:57:33.075]  It's my best work to date.
[01:57:33.555 --> 01:57:34.456]  It needs to be seen.
[01:57:34.476 --> 01:57:37.777]  You're authorized to make copies for non-profit, not for sale purposes.
[01:57:38.157 --> 01:57:42.539]  Third hour, your call is a ton of news straight ahead.
[01:57:43.399 --> 01:57:43.980]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:49.842 --> 01:57:50.522]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.142 --> 01:57:52.143]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:52.908 --> 01:57:54.009]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:55.529]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.549 --> 01:57:58.171]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.191 --> 01:58:01.752]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.993 --> 01:58:06.155]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.495 --> 01:58:10.076]  Time flies when you're battling the globalists.
[01:58:10.397 --> 01:58:19.801]  We're already into the third hour on this live Wednesday edition of the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:20.341 --> 01:58:21.282]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:21.903 --> 01:58:23.964]  We've got Paul Watson riding shotgun with us.
[01:58:24.604 --> 01:58:26.945]  Rita, Steve, and many others, your calls are coming up.
[01:58:26.985 --> 01:58:35.609]  What we'll do is we'll go through little blitzes of calls, little groupings of calls, and then back into little groupings of news.
[01:58:36.089 --> 01:58:37.670]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:38.210 --> 01:58:44.913]  Some of the things I want to cover is this new urban warfare takeover drill they're doing.
[01:58:44.933 --> 01:58:46.674]  This is from the Pentagon Zone website.
[01:58:48.067 --> 01:58:50.628]  CBS News, die conspiracy theory revealed.
[01:58:50.848 --> 01:58:51.848]  Paul's an expert on this.
[01:58:51.868 --> 01:58:53.188]  We'll go over some of their propaganda.
[01:58:53.668 --> 01:58:55.669]  Vets sue Rumsfeld over health care cuts.
[01:58:56.269 --> 01:58:58.149]  FBI's power may become fearsome.
[01:58:58.169 --> 01:59:05.430]  We'll also get into anti-illegal activists threatened to poison people's food.
[01:59:07.291 --> 01:59:12.792]  That is, the anti-illegal activists have been threatened with having their food poisoned by the matcha crowd.
[01:59:13.835 --> 01:59:18.578]  A major offensive going on in Iraq right now, the al-Zawahiri situation.
[01:59:18.598 --> 01:59:20.459]  I mean, how many times have they killed him, captured him?
[01:59:20.499 --> 01:59:21.400]  It's just ridiculous.
[01:59:22.621 --> 01:59:27.004]  It makes the private lynch Pat Tillman propaganda look absolutely, just unbelievably stupid.
[01:59:27.804 --> 01:59:29.805]  It just gets worse and worse by the millisecond.
[01:59:30.546 --> 01:59:31.867]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[01:59:32.227 --> 01:59:35.769]  Paul, right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:59:35.950 --> 01:59:37.591]  Rita in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:59:37.631 --> 01:59:38.071]  Go ahead, Rita.
[01:59:38.826 --> 01:59:39.947]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:40.027 --> 01:59:43.691]  Somebody called up a little while ago asking about George Norrie and that just brought something to mind.
[01:59:44.151 --> 01:59:46.313]  Have you ever heard of hypersonic sound?
[01:59:48.135 --> 01:59:48.495]  Yes.
[01:59:49.056 --> 01:59:52.079]  And the guy was on George Norrie the other day and it's...
[01:59:52.583 --> 01:59:57.165]  A speaker that can go 500 times the distance of a regular speaker.
[01:59:57.565 --> 02:00:01.187]  You can point it at one person and they'll be the only person that can hear it.
[02:00:01.347 --> 02:00:02.847]  Yeah, I have the CEO on.
[02:00:02.867 --> 02:00:13.172]  They have Coke machines for three years in Tokyo that from like 50 yards away target your head with a sensor and then beam it to your skull.
[02:00:13.672 --> 02:00:14.512]  That was patented in 1956.
[02:00:16.403 --> 02:00:25.351]  And it's similar to the huge sound can as they use to shatter people's nerve endings in their middle ear that they had in New York.
[02:00:25.371 --> 02:00:26.552]  They're also using in Iraq.
[02:00:26.572 --> 02:00:27.132]  Paul Watson?
[02:00:28.173 --> 02:00:40.844]  Well, yeah, and now it's going a step beyond that with what they call neuro-advertising, where they literally scan your brain for your interest as you're walking past an advertising billboard.
[02:00:41.531 --> 02:00:44.493]  And then the appropriate product is displayed on the table.
[02:00:44.513 --> 02:00:48.876]  Yeah, it picks up, is the area of your brain associated with sexual excitement activated?
[02:00:49.336 --> 02:00:51.798]  Is your area associated with headaches excited?
[02:00:52.638 --> 02:00:54.159]  And they're already talking about testing it.
[02:00:54.239 --> 02:00:55.440]  And, again, five U.S.
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:00:56.381]  airports already have this.
[02:00:56.781 --> 02:00:59.122]  Passive MRIs that scan your brain.
[02:00:59.163 --> 02:01:02.024]  And if you're upset, they're going to question you.
[02:01:03.085 --> 02:01:08.168]  You know, I was in the grocery store, and I noticed that they had these televisions, like, above, like, frozen meat cabinets.
[02:01:10.339 --> 02:01:10.699]  Are you there?
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:11.580]  Yes, I'm listening.
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:12.020]  Oh, okay.
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.121]  I heard a click, so I didn't know.
[02:01:13.542 --> 02:01:18.385]  Anyway, and I noticed that, and then now at the checkout, they have these television cameras for you to watch, you know.
[02:01:19.246 --> 02:01:23.409]  And I noticed that when you get up to them, you don't hear them until you get right by them.
[02:01:23.770 --> 02:01:25.951]  And I'm wondering if that's what they're doing in the stores, too.
[02:01:26.232 --> 02:01:27.433]  No, they have them turned down.
[02:01:28.553 --> 02:01:30.455]  Well, as soon as you get in front of it, you can hear it.
[02:01:31.033 --> 02:01:34.995]  Well, it may have a little sensor in it that automatically kicks it on, which is a precursor.
[02:01:35.475 --> 02:01:37.375]  Yeah, the hypersonic sound, you can look it up.
[02:01:37.456 --> 02:01:39.216]  It's at the Chicago Trade Show right now.
[02:01:39.316 --> 02:01:43.218]  No, no, I have the CEO on that first put it in cut.
[02:01:43.278 --> 02:01:43.638]  Woody Norris?
[02:01:44.398 --> 02:01:44.698]  Pardon me?
[02:01:44.978 --> 02:01:46.059]  Woody Norris is the guy?
[02:01:46.079 --> 02:01:46.579]  I don't remember.
[02:01:46.599 --> 02:01:49.340]  It's a California-based company that first put them in cut machines.
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:57.723]  Yeah, I wonder how many schizomeds were sold with hypersonic sound and these people that are hearing these voices, you know, that do crazy things.
[02:01:57.803 --> 02:01:59.424]  It's, oh, well, he was hearing voices, you know.
[02:02:00.046 --> 02:02:01.086]  But anyhow, yeah.
[02:02:01.106 --> 02:02:03.447]  It's called Sound the Skull technology.
[02:02:04.027 --> 02:02:04.507]  All right.
[02:02:04.767 --> 02:02:05.287]  And you know what?
[02:02:05.407 --> 02:02:13.449]  One last thing is just, you know, for your symbol, does anybody make a do not skull and bones, you know, like do not enter, that big red slash in a circle?
[02:02:13.469 --> 02:02:16.190]  You know, I was thinking that would make a good bumper sticker.
[02:02:16.230 --> 02:02:18.411]  Do not skull and bones and then InfoWars.com.
[02:02:20.071 --> 02:02:21.091]  Yeah, that sounds interesting.
[02:02:21.111 --> 02:02:22.392]  Yeah, no skull and bones.
[02:02:22.592 --> 02:02:23.932]  Yeah, do not skull and bones.
[02:02:24.212 --> 02:02:25.613]  Okay, see you, Alex.
[02:02:25.773 --> 02:02:26.213]  Thank you.
[02:02:26.293 --> 02:02:26.833]  Great points.
[02:02:28.426 --> 02:02:32.268]  We will get a comment from Lord Watson on the other side about her call.
[02:02:33.008 --> 02:02:35.849]  Then we will take more of your calls and cover more news.
[02:02:36.970 --> 02:02:37.630]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.353 --> 02:02:49.675]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.695 --> 02:02:53.677]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World War.
[02:02:56.493 --> 02:02:58.835]  Use this disaster as a new world order.
[02:02:58.895 --> 02:03:01.717]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:03:01.977 --> 02:03:06.220]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:13.204]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.325 --> 02:03:15.346]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.566 --> 02:03:26.089]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.309 --> 02:03:31.730]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:03:32.211 --> 02:03:34.871]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:03:34.951 --> 02:03:35.712]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.732 --> 02:03:36.112]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:36.132 --> 02:03:37.872]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:44.972 --> 02:03:45.572]  Hello, folks.
[02:03:45.672 --> 02:03:46.593]  Alex Jones here.
[02:03:46.733 --> 02:03:50.816]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:50.976 --> 02:03:53.837]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:53.937 --> 02:04:00.642]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:00.822 --> 02:04:03.843]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:04.044 --> 02:04:06.425]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:06.565 --> 02:04:14.650]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as abacus,
[02:04:14.730 --> 02:04:16.331]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:04:45.271 --> 02:04:52.156]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:04:52.677 --> 02:04:58.101]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex nail gel.
[02:04:58.501 --> 02:05:08.509]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:05:08.649 --> 02:05:10.990]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:14.451]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:05:14.471 --> 02:05:16.072]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:05:16.192 --> 02:05:23.675]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:05:23.935 --> 02:05:25.676]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[02:05:26.016 --> 02:05:37.701]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:05:38.281 --> 02:05:42.642]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:05:49.843 --> 02:05:50.503]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.143 --> 02:05:52.223]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.924 --> 02:05:54.024]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.664 --> 02:05:55.504]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.244 --> 02:05:58.165]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.185 --> 02:06:01.505]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.985 --> 02:06:06.066]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.107 --> 02:06:11.887]  All right, we've got about 51 minutes left.
[02:06:12.327 --> 02:06:14.548]  Loaded phone lines, masses of news.
[02:06:14.708 --> 02:06:20.869]  Paul Watson riding shotgun with us, the webmaster of PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:06:22.849 --> 02:06:28.450]  Right now, Dr. Breeding, and Paul, I want you to be in on this with us, because I want to know if you've got similar stuff going on in England.
[02:06:28.470 --> 02:06:31.091]  I've read you have, but not even this draconian.
[02:06:31.431 --> 02:06:35.932]  Dr. Breeding's been down giving press conferences, lobbying downtown at the Capitol here in Austin.
[02:06:37.250 --> 02:06:43.975]  They're trying to pass the New Freedom Initiative, and they keep trying to water it down to please people, but it's only watered down on the surface.
[02:06:44.415 --> 02:06:45.475]  The language is still there.
[02:06:45.536 --> 02:06:58.424]  So real quick, to give us an update on this legislation at the, deep in the heart of Texas, at the state capitals, Dr. John Breeding, and to give us those phone numbers, because they're on the verge this afternoon of giving us the new freedom.
[02:06:58.784 --> 02:07:03.848]  You must give us your children so we can test them with guidelines written by the drug companies.
[02:07:03.908 --> 02:07:04.468]  Ha ha ha!
[02:07:05.180 --> 02:07:07.122]  But Dr. Breeding, tell us all about it.
[02:07:07.783 --> 02:07:08.703]  Okay, thanks Alex.
[02:07:08.723 --> 02:07:09.444]  Just real quick.
[02:07:10.325 --> 02:07:16.991]  Your callers are creating a lot of frazzled politicians right now is the main thing I wanted to say first of all.
[02:07:17.612 --> 02:07:20.034]  They're really feeling the heat.
[02:07:20.174 --> 02:07:22.537]  The people who don't like the amendment but want it.
[02:07:22.577 --> 02:07:27.922]  There's an amendment basically that puts this new freedom language onto another bill that's relatively innocuous.
[02:07:28.382 --> 02:07:30.244]  The people that sponsor that bill
[02:07:30.572 --> 02:07:30.933]  I think so.
[02:07:45.187 --> 02:07:50.412]  So people in Texas and people all over the country are calling, and now it's time to call Governor Perry.
[02:07:50.432 --> 02:07:53.174]  Well, ask them why they want to turn Texas into the Soviet Union.
[02:07:53.514 --> 02:07:55.336]  They were the masters of your mentally ill.
[02:07:55.456 --> 02:08:01.041]  In China, they grab you if you criticize the government and drag you off for forced drugging until you're well.
[02:08:02.553 --> 02:08:04.154]  Paul Watson, any comments on this?
[02:08:05.055 --> 02:08:13.259]  Well, yeah, I mean, that's exactly what the Soviet defectors came out and warned against, that government defines mental illness as opposition to authority.
[02:08:13.419 --> 02:08:14.680]  Alexander Shultz needs them.
[02:08:15.340 --> 02:08:17.421]  Yeah, it's what every tyrant throughout history has done.
[02:08:18.702 --> 02:08:22.804]  They've got a similar bill in this country, the Mental Health Act, which they're trying to pass.
[02:08:24.243 --> 02:08:35.152]  Whereby the language defines mental illness as temporarily unable to make decisions, which is so vague it could be applied to anything.
[02:08:35.613 --> 02:08:49.524]  Well, basically, they want to get rid of the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and their path to it is to circumnavigate it all and just say, no, these little psychiatrists with their degrees who go off handbooks written by the drug companies, we will say who's best.
[02:08:50.942 --> 02:08:51.923]  Yeah, you guys got it.
[02:08:51.983 --> 02:08:53.464]  It's driven by the drug companies.
[02:08:53.524 --> 02:08:56.747]  They funded the algorithms in Texas that decide what drugs.
[02:08:57.468 --> 02:09:02.653]  They were behind the development of... All the new ones that have patents on them that are very expensive, of course.
[02:09:02.793 --> 02:09:03.213]  That's right.
[02:09:03.513 --> 02:09:05.255]  And we're using them more and more with our children.
[02:09:05.295 --> 02:09:12.722]  Children of color are disproportionately represented, but all children are... And that's because the state psychiatrist said that it's a bad gene pool.
[02:09:13.002 --> 02:09:15.264]  Yeah, right, and because they have public funding.
[02:09:15.839 --> 02:09:17.940]  They can get the Medicaid funding to pay for the drugs.
[02:09:18.000 --> 02:09:19.820]  Now, what's the chances?
[02:09:19.860 --> 02:09:21.641]  We shot down three bills a month and a half ago.
[02:09:21.661 --> 02:09:22.301]  This one's in committee.
[02:09:22.321 --> 02:09:23.482]  We shot down three bills.
[02:09:23.562 --> 02:09:24.562]  This one's in committee.
[02:09:24.582 --> 02:09:26.923]  It's hanging on by a thread, though, I tell you.
[02:09:27.363 --> 02:09:30.264]  And we've got about four different strategies going on over there.
[02:09:30.384 --> 02:09:31.885]  This is the info war.
[02:09:31.945 --> 02:09:34.366]  Intensify firepower to the forward batteries.
[02:09:34.386 --> 02:09:41.188]  I talked to a couple of politicians directly today who were just not real nice to me because they were just so frustrated with getting...
[02:09:41.713 --> 02:09:45.514]  Call after call after call, and their bill being in jeopardy.
[02:09:45.594 --> 02:09:46.814]  Intensify firepower.
[02:09:46.854 --> 02:09:47.474]  What's the phone number?
[02:09:47.494 --> 02:09:48.415]  Intensify firepower.
[02:09:48.835 --> 02:09:50.735]  Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst, 512-463-0001.
[02:09:51.675 --> 02:09:54.056]  That's Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst, 512-463-0001.
[02:09:54.156 --> 02:09:55.216]  And Governor Perry, 512-463-2000.
[02:09:55.236 --> 02:09:55.276]  512-463-2000.
[02:10:10.356 --> 02:10:14.359]  This is Perry's baby, and we want him to know it's a poison baby, and it needs to die.
[02:10:14.379 --> 02:10:15.440]  Well, he's got problems.
[02:10:15.560 --> 02:10:21.084]  I mean, he's the guy, 90-plus percent don't want toll roads, and he just says, I'll give you more than the whole nation has.
[02:10:21.124 --> 02:10:22.205]  He's got a lot of problems.
[02:10:22.285 --> 02:10:25.687]  A lot of his initiatives are falling apart, and this one needs to fall apart, too.
[02:10:25.908 --> 02:10:28.750]  Well, that's because they're blackmailing the governor.
[02:10:29.030 --> 02:10:31.031]  Yeah.
[02:10:31.051 --> 02:10:31.272]  512-463-2000.
[02:10:32.312 --> 02:10:33.153]  You're making a difference.
[02:10:33.173 --> 02:10:35.094]  I really appreciate it, Alex, and all your callers.
[02:10:35.154 --> 02:10:37.056]  Please know that your calls are getting...
[02:10:37.443 --> 02:10:39.345]  In effect, we've got a firestorm going.
[02:10:39.625 --> 02:10:41.326]  We'll know tomorrow the outcome on this one.
[02:10:42.527 --> 02:10:46.090]  Give us those numbers, a volley of numbers, one more time in case people missed them.
[02:10:46.610 --> 02:10:46.931]  Okay.
[02:10:47.931 --> 02:10:49.773]  Governor Dewhurst, Lieutenant Governor, 512-463-0001.
[02:10:50.113 --> 02:10:51.094]  Governor Perry, 512-463-2000.
[02:10:51.114 --> 02:10:52.575]  It's House Bill 2572...
[02:11:06.004 --> 02:11:08.965]  Particularly Amendment 1, no mental health screening.
[02:11:09.005 --> 02:11:13.166]  We want our children protected from government intrusion and from psychiatric intrusion.
[02:11:14.086 --> 02:11:16.767]  And again, Texas is the big battleground right now.
[02:11:16.787 --> 02:11:17.407]  That's right.
[02:11:17.807 --> 02:11:18.428]  On this subject.
[02:11:18.588 --> 02:11:19.708]  Dr. Breeding, thanks for the info.
[02:11:19.728 --> 02:11:20.188]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:11:20.488 --> 02:11:20.908]  Take care.
[02:11:20.948 --> 02:11:27.170]  There's an update, and believe me, all over the country, you should call, this affects everyone, but especially Texans.
[02:11:27.790 --> 02:11:28.730]  I mean, it's going to happen.
[02:11:28.770 --> 02:11:29.711]  Your child will come home.
[02:11:30.791 --> 02:11:33.272]  I mean, they were telling the horror stories at the press conference yesterday.
[02:11:33.292 --> 02:11:34.072]  I heard it on the radio.
[02:11:35.024 --> 02:11:37.586]  And, you know, they get your 13-year-old daughter.
[02:11:37.606 --> 02:11:38.586]  Do you feel depressed?
[02:11:38.606 --> 02:11:39.407]  Do you ever get sad?
[02:11:39.467 --> 02:11:39.727]  Yes.
[02:11:40.187 --> 02:11:41.228]  We're taking you right now.
[02:11:41.288 --> 02:11:41.748]  That's it.
[02:11:42.068 --> 02:11:43.689]  We're putting you in custody.
[02:11:44.170 --> 02:11:45.390]  Give her the drugs right now.
[02:11:46.951 --> 02:11:47.932]  Paul Watson comments.
[02:11:48.712 --> 02:11:56.697]  Well, I mean, it's the whole nebulous nature of depression that makes it so easy to manipulate, you know, the definition of it and the treatment of it.
[02:11:57.416 --> 02:11:59.918]  And they put out all these confusing studies.
[02:11:59.958 --> 02:12:08.645]  There was a big university recently put out a study which said that smoking contributed largely to developing depression.
[02:12:08.665 --> 02:12:11.567]  And what was their solution to the problem?
[02:12:11.807 --> 02:12:12.508]  Nicotine.
[02:12:13.989 --> 02:12:16.931]  So they put out these intentionally confusing studies.
[02:12:16.971 --> 02:12:18.833]  I'll tell you what the biggest thing is with depression.
[02:12:19.714 --> 02:12:20.454]  With young people.
[02:12:21.195 --> 02:12:23.917]  That we are designed at around 13 or 14 to want to leave the hut.
[02:12:26.084 --> 02:12:29.965]  That is, leave the family unit and start our own hut.
[02:12:30.825 --> 02:12:32.626]  And that's just how we're designed.
[02:12:32.686 --> 02:12:33.666]  Mammals, period.
[02:12:35.667 --> 02:12:36.527]  Your babies love you.
[02:12:36.547 --> 02:12:38.368]  Then when they become teenagers, they don't like you.
[02:12:38.408 --> 02:12:39.268]  Then they want to leave.
[02:12:39.768 --> 02:12:42.169]  And then, of course, they come back to you later saying that you were right.
[02:12:42.189 --> 02:12:43.209]  But that's how we're designed.
[02:12:43.229 --> 02:12:44.049]  That's how God designed us.
[02:12:44.609 --> 02:12:49.251]  Well, Madison Avenue makes us feel inadequate because we don't have the bling bling and the new Cadillac.
[02:12:50.291 --> 02:12:54.032]  The culture that they bombard our children with tries to make them grow up too fast.
[02:12:54.998 --> 02:12:59.303]  Confuses them, destroys their innocence, and so you do have problems.
[02:12:59.363 --> 02:13:03.928]  And in between the Twinkie machines and the Coke machines, it is a recipe for disaster.
[02:13:03.948 --> 02:13:13.978]  Their answer is deadly pharmacological drugs that accelerate the depression and suicidal tendencies and violence, and then that packs the prisons with good little criminals.
[02:13:13.998 --> 02:13:15.300]  It's a nice system, Paul.
[02:13:16.275 --> 02:13:33.548]  Yeah, and then there was that study covered by the Washington Post where 50% of the participants in the experiment were given placebos, sugar pills, to treat depression, while the others were given drugs, and 50% who took the sugar pills recovered.
[02:13:34.929 --> 02:13:38.011]  It had better results than the Prozac.
[02:13:38.584 --> 02:13:38.964]  Exactly.
[02:13:38.984 --> 02:13:40.606]  And then they did St.
[02:13:40.646 --> 02:13:44.328]  John's wort, and the sugar pill did better.
[02:13:45.209 --> 02:13:46.630]  Prozac made them more depressed.
[02:13:46.830 --> 02:13:48.511]  It was another serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[02:13:48.531 --> 02:13:49.252]  It wasn't Prozac.
[02:13:49.272 --> 02:13:49.812]  Same thing, though.
[02:13:50.213 --> 02:13:51.213]  And then St.
[02:13:51.273 --> 02:13:54.876]  John's actually got triple the results and actually helped people.
[02:13:55.536 --> 02:13:56.037]  That's right.
[02:13:56.957 --> 02:14:00.359]  Which is why a lot of the alternative therapy, the St.
[02:14:00.399 --> 02:14:11.724]  John's wort and other similar vitamin compounds, that's why they're under the crackdown both in the US and from the EU in Europe with these new regulations making them prescription only.
[02:14:11.804 --> 02:14:14.385]  Now over the counter sales of certain vitamins over...
[02:14:14.905 --> 02:14:16.145]  A level of dosage.
[02:14:16.466 --> 02:14:19.166]  And then again, most of the depression comes in the winter for adults.
[02:14:19.607 --> 02:14:33.251]  That's because the eyes need to pick up a certain level of bright sunshine for a chemical reaction in the brain, just like your skin needs a certain amount of sun for a key vitamin that can only be produced and broken down in the skin.
[02:14:33.691 --> 02:14:41.553]  And so people who live in winter areas need to make themselves get outside for at least 20 minutes outside of the shade and get the sunlight.
[02:14:41.793 --> 02:14:42.834]  That'll do better than the St.
[02:14:42.874 --> 02:14:44.254]  John's wort, which you don't need either.
[02:14:45.143 --> 02:14:45.603]  That's right.
[02:14:45.624 --> 02:14:49.547]  Anytime I feel down in the winter, I just go for a two-hour walk and I feel great.
[02:14:50.228 --> 02:14:52.510]  Yeah, it's called seasonal affective disorder.
[02:14:53.090 --> 02:14:53.951]  I mean, I get it.
[02:14:53.971 --> 02:14:55.112]  I don't necessarily feel depressed.
[02:14:55.132 --> 02:15:00.977]  The highest rate of suicide in the world is in the Scandinavian countries, and it's always, you know, in the 20 hours of darkness.
[02:15:01.437 --> 02:15:01.658]  Yeah.
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:10.045]  So they started painting the walls bright white in the offices and putting happy lights in that broadcast sunlight.
[02:15:11.372 --> 02:15:15.314]  Well, yeah, I mean, you can buy those lights, which give off that sort of thing, and it works.
[02:15:15.654 --> 02:15:25.259]  I mean, it's very simple, and it's natural to get this in the first place, but as you said, the whole culture erected around it is to drive people towards these... I've got a happy light on right now!
[02:15:25.279 --> 02:15:26.840]  No, I do.
[02:15:26.900 --> 02:15:29.881]  I mean, there's a happy light in here that my friend... Well, what about the chip in your brain?
[02:15:29.961 --> 02:15:34.884]  Surely the government-mandated chip is the real solution, as they announced last week again.
[02:15:34.904 --> 02:15:38.486]  Well, I'm an evil Al-Qaeda member.
[02:15:38.666 --> 02:15:39.006]  I, uh...
[02:15:40.109 --> 02:15:45.154]  I have a happy life, so it needs to be controlled, Paul.
[02:15:45.854 --> 02:15:48.777]  I want to go to some calls, Paul, but again, I mentioned all this news.
[02:15:48.817 --> 02:15:51.779]  Let's just briefly talk about the latest thing.
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:57.925]  Metcha says that when the Minutemen come to have a conference in Las Vegas, that their illegal workers in the restaurant should poison them.
[02:15:58.786 --> 02:16:01.228]  And I mean, they have the nerve to put this out on their website, Paul.
[02:16:02.660 --> 02:16:10.165]  Yeah, and then when the Associated Press goes and talks to both parties, you know, they're heavily focused on the Metro leaders denouncing the Minutemen.
[02:16:10.285 --> 02:16:16.309]  It's totally biased, it's a totally racist organization, but they're a supposed minority, so it's okay.
[02:16:16.490 --> 02:16:21.073]  They call the Minutemen racist when their motto is, for everything for the race, outside the race, nothing.
[02:16:22.173 --> 02:16:27.377]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's the same case with a lot of, you know, leaders of these minority groups.
[02:16:28.830 --> 02:16:32.913]  They preach tolerance, and yet they don't tolerate any criticism of their group.
[02:16:33.073 --> 02:16:35.836]  But that means, tolerance means submitting to them.
[02:16:36.536 --> 02:16:37.037]  Exactly.
[02:16:38.198 --> 02:16:39.278]  Same with any movement.
[02:16:39.298 --> 02:16:45.384]  The homosexual movement preaches tolerance, but wants to imprison pastors who read out Bible on the street.
[02:16:47.445 --> 02:16:48.306]  Well, they charged them.
[02:16:48.326 --> 02:16:49.567]  They almost went to prison.
[02:16:49.847 --> 02:16:50.148]  47 years.
[02:16:51.188 --> 02:16:51.609]  Exactly.
[02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:55.292]  So, tolerance of them, but no tolerance of any criticism of them.
[02:16:57.190 --> 02:16:59.891]  And then the left loves that, so now they can't protest Bush.
[02:16:59.971 --> 02:17:01.312]  See, it's double-edged.
[02:17:01.612 --> 02:17:01.832]  Yeah.
[02:17:04.493 --> 02:17:05.174]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:05.574 --> 02:17:10.396]  We'll come back to calls, Paul, and then I want to get into how many times have they killed the number two Al-Qaeda man?
[02:17:12.577 --> 02:17:14.358]  That I know of, about three.
[02:17:14.378 --> 02:17:21.381]  They've also captured him three or four times, and now, again, he's evacuated the country, supposedly.
[02:17:22.549 --> 02:17:24.051]  Ah, he's been injured for the fourth time.
[02:17:24.471 --> 02:17:24.731]  Yeah.
[02:17:25.011 --> 02:17:26.953]  We're getting really close to him, folks.
[02:17:26.973 --> 02:17:31.917]  You can believe us on Pat Tillman and Private Lynch and Al Zawary, or however you pronounce this idiot's name.
[02:17:32.738 --> 02:17:33.979]  Another CIA pimp.
[02:17:34.780 --> 02:17:38.043]  We'll be right back with your calls and a lot more on the other side.
[02:17:38.063 --> 02:17:39.844]  Don't forget prisonplanet.tv.
[02:17:47.017 --> 02:17:48.618]  You've heard it over and over again.
[02:17:48.858 --> 02:17:51.340]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:55.322]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[02:17:55.622 --> 02:18:00.485]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[02:18:00.805 --> 02:18:01.506]  Don't wait for when.
[02:18:01.766 --> 02:18:02.867]  It's important to act now.
[02:18:03.147 --> 02:18:06.849]  And Ready Reserve Foods has everything you need as your survival supply headquarters.
[02:18:07.069 --> 02:18:07.549]  We're good to go.
[02:18:31.886 --> 02:18:32.587]  Don't wait for when.
[02:18:32.907 --> 02:18:33.348]  Act now.

[02:18:35.650 --> 02:18:37.752]  It's better to be a year too early than a day too late.

[02:19:37.575 --> 02:19:38.055]  Hi, folks.

[02:19:39.556 --> 02:19:40.436]  For real money, folks.
[02:19:53.797 --> 02:19:55.458]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:19:55.478 --> 02:19:56.559]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:19:56.599 --> 02:19:57.619]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:19:57.719 --> 02:19:58.160]  A 5% increase.
[02:19:58.200 --> 02:20:00.641]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[02:20:00.661 --> 02:20:02.522]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[02:20:02.542 --> 02:20:04.003]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[02:20:04.023 --> 02:20:05.504]  A 16% increase in real money.
[02:20:21.292 --> 02:20:22.573]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.

[02:20:48.908 --> 02:20:58.480]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:20:59.551 --> 02:21:09.095]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that'll let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:21:10.115 --> 02:21:15.617]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[02:21:50.161 --> 02:21:52.082]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.562 --> 02:21:55.303]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.766 --> 02:21:57.326]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:21:57.647 --> 02:22:03.591]  Let's go to some coal.
[02:22:03.812 --> 02:22:05.653]  Steve in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:22:05.673 --> 02:22:06.394]  Go ahead, Steve.
[02:22:06.814 --> 02:22:07.535]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:22:07.975 --> 02:22:08.816]  Good.
[02:22:08.956 --> 02:22:12.419]  Rents.com has a very good article on the midway through the page.
[02:22:12.539 --> 02:22:16.622]  It's called, by John Kaminsky, called Six Strategies for Senseless Slaughter.
[02:22:17.382 --> 02:22:20.585]  And it's about the fact that our government soldiers are pulling over
[02:22:22.402 --> 02:22:26.625]  Iraqi farmers and planting bombs in there, and that's where all these bombs are coming from.
[02:22:26.645 --> 02:22:28.947]  So I don't know if you've seen that already.
[02:22:30.248 --> 02:22:39.895]  Well, I know that P2OG calls for things like that, and I know that we got Israeli documents from the early 80s where they said they wanted to break Iraq down and have it an endless civil war.
[02:22:40.455 --> 02:22:41.936]  That's the pretext to stay there.
[02:22:42.457 --> 02:22:46.140]  As they build the new, it wasn't going to be 3,000 persons, but now it's going to be 6,000 people.
[02:22:47.786 --> 02:22:52.449]  ...person, mega embassy, and it's like the war on drugs.
[02:22:52.629 --> 02:22:53.689]  We think it's failing.
[02:22:53.749 --> 02:22:54.610]  No, it's succeeding.
[02:22:54.670 --> 02:22:58.152]  More people on drugs, more people in prison.
[02:22:59.232 --> 02:23:00.373]  Education's not failing.
[02:23:00.393 --> 02:23:02.714]  They're dumbing us down, getting the money for what they paid for.
[02:23:02.754 --> 02:23:03.595]  Thanks for the call, Steve.
[02:23:04.175 --> 02:23:05.136]  Paul, comments on that?
[02:23:05.156 --> 02:23:11.299]  Well, yeah, we've talked about that in the past, whether some of these bombings are staged.
[02:23:11.679 --> 02:23:16.502]  We know that a lot of the beheadings and kidnappings were where it would be...
[02:23:17.552 --> 02:23:23.216]  You know, Iraqi security forces in sharp suits and then it gets blamed on insurgents.
[02:23:23.716 --> 02:23:35.184]  British troops have been quoted before as saying that they think some of the bombings are being done by the US and a lot of the car bombs certainly in the past have left
[02:23:39.743 --> 02:23:45.064]  And for those who don't know, I mean, when our troops get bombed, that's real.
[02:23:45.144 --> 02:23:46.745]  When the Green Zone gets bombed, that's real.
[02:23:46.765 --> 02:23:47.605]  A lot of these are real.
[02:23:48.005 --> 02:23:51.926]  But then when enemies of the administration get bombed, it's blamed on Al-Qaeda.
[02:23:52.446 --> 02:23:54.507]  You know, why would Al-Qaeda go bomb their own people?
[02:23:55.467 --> 02:23:56.267]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[02:23:56.974 --> 02:24:01.798]  Well, I mean, they're certainly desperately trying to stir up resentment to have more bombings.
[02:24:01.858 --> 02:24:05.700]  You know, things like releasing these Saddam and his underpants photos.
[02:24:05.780 --> 02:24:08.362]  So, obviously, some of them are real bombings.
[02:24:08.462 --> 02:24:14.106]  Because for those that don't know, to the Muslims, that is the... It's horrible to see a man in his underpants.
[02:24:14.807 --> 02:24:15.027]  Yeah.
[02:24:18.209 --> 02:24:19.150]  Bill in Canada.
[02:24:19.190 --> 02:24:20.010]  Bill, you're on the air.
[02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:20.511]  Go ahead.
[02:24:20.791 --> 02:24:21.331]  Yes, Alex.
[02:24:21.572 --> 02:24:22.832]  How are you doing, brother Alex?
[02:24:23.173 --> 02:24:23.413]  Good.
[02:24:23.793 --> 02:24:24.794]  I highly respect you.
[02:24:25.956 --> 02:24:37.879]  What you're saying on a daily basis, I hope you carry on because you are exposing the evil, and I'm very proud to have someone in the United States of America that has all the brains.
[02:24:38.959 --> 02:24:40.679]  Well, I appreciate the compliment, sir.
[02:24:40.799 --> 02:24:45.200]  And I tell you one thing, we get chemtrails on a daily basis around Toronto.
[02:24:45.400 --> 02:24:52.402]  When I talk to the cops about this, they look at me, they tell me, why don't you go back where you come from?
[02:24:54.016 --> 02:24:54.376]  Really?
[02:24:54.736 --> 02:24:59.258]  Yeah, the police sergeant wasn't very pleased with me a couple weeks ago.
[02:24:59.718 --> 02:25:05.060]  I was in a plaza and outside in a parking lot, I was looking at the chemtrailers.
[02:25:05.100 --> 02:25:05.780]  He looked at them.
[02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:07.561]  They're spraying chemicals all over us.
[02:25:08.341 --> 02:25:09.002]  And he looked at me.
[02:25:09.062 --> 02:25:10.122]  He says, what, you're crazy?
[02:25:11.282 --> 02:25:12.703]  Why don't you go back where you came from?
[02:25:12.723 --> 02:25:13.943]  You're causing trouble.
[02:25:14.223 --> 02:25:15.124]  And I said, no, I'm not.
[02:25:15.524 --> 02:25:17.465]  They're spraying us like rats in a cage.
[02:25:18.425 --> 02:25:20.446]  So he actually told you, go back where you come from?
[02:25:20.606 --> 02:25:20.946]  Yes.
[02:25:21.880 --> 02:25:23.060]  And I tell you one thing, brother.
[02:25:23.120 --> 02:25:24.321]  I was trained in Brazil.
[02:25:24.361 --> 02:25:25.281]  I'm from Brazil.
[02:25:25.581 --> 02:25:28.522]  I was trained by a Jesuit seminary.
[02:25:29.422 --> 02:25:31.522]  And I can see all that exposure.
[02:25:31.642 --> 02:25:33.043]  I like to expose lots of things.
[02:25:33.143 --> 02:25:35.183]  And I can see everything that's going on here.
[02:25:35.723 --> 02:25:37.564]  Preparation for a third world war.
[02:25:37.944 --> 02:25:38.644]  Don't get me wrong.
[02:25:39.124 --> 02:25:40.224]  I'm not preaching hatred.
[02:25:40.784 --> 02:25:42.525]  I'm preaching exposure.
[02:25:42.805 --> 02:25:43.165]  Look at it.
[02:25:44.145 --> 02:25:47.946]  After the seminary, I came to the United States and I joined the military.
[02:25:47.966 --> 02:25:51.347]  I spent over nine years in the Special Forces, Green Berets.
[02:25:52.611 --> 02:25:58.312]  And when I was doing researches, who owns the army of United States, globally, all the army?
[02:25:58.952 --> 02:26:03.813]  When you do very close researches, Alex, are you there?
[02:26:04.233 --> 02:26:04.574]  Yes.
[02:26:04.814 --> 02:26:20.497]  When you do very close researches, the banking system, the money cartel, when you look at the history of Rothschild, and Napoleonic wars, and all the Soviet wars in Japan, all the money cartel is in control in the Vatican, in the Zionism,
[02:26:21.331 --> 02:26:22.571]  I'm not picking on anybody.
[02:26:22.611 --> 02:26:23.552]  I'm only exposing.
[02:26:24.472 --> 02:26:26.632]  Well, I'll tell you, I mean, I'll tell you this.
[02:26:26.792 --> 02:26:34.774]  Clearly, I mean, even Thomas Barnett, the big top Naval War College golden boy, says, we work for the global government, the U.S.
[02:26:34.814 --> 02:26:38.255]  military works for the corporations, we don't work for the American people.
[02:26:38.615 --> 02:26:40.556]  Paul, you've seen the video of him on C-SPAN.
[02:26:40.576 --> 02:26:42.056]  I mean, it's not even a secret, is it, Paul?
[02:26:42.316 --> 02:26:44.576]  No, I like... Paul, comment.
[02:26:44.837 --> 02:26:46.617]  Let Paul comment, then I'll let you comment, Paul.
[02:26:47.825 --> 02:26:48.966]  No, it's out in the open.
[02:26:49.566 --> 02:26:54.369]  We've got the Barnett video in the video section of PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:26:55.109 --> 02:27:01.173]  Basically, he's just talking about global government, the New World Order, but using different, more catchy terms for it.
[02:27:01.453 --> 02:27:04.835]  So, you know, trying to make it appear as if it's something new and different.
[02:27:04.915 --> 02:27:07.137]  But he openly says we work for Wall Street.
[02:27:07.897 --> 02:27:08.157]  Yeah.
[02:27:09.778 --> 02:27:11.880]  It's like Smedley Butler, but he's saying it's good.
[02:27:12.540 --> 02:27:12.900]  Yes, sir?
[02:27:13.140 --> 02:27:13.401]  Yes.
[02:27:14.001 --> 02:27:17.263]  I was first Louis in the United States military.
[02:27:17.896 --> 02:27:29.344]  When I asked Lieutenant Colonel, and I phoned Bo Gritz one time, I said, because you are such a big patriot, and you open your eyes and see the truth, you heard about Bo Gritz, right?
[02:27:30.004 --> 02:27:30.645]  Yeah, stay there.
[02:27:30.665 --> 02:27:31.906]  I'll let you finish up when we get back.
[02:27:35.808 --> 02:27:36.749]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.209 --> 02:27:38.810]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.731 --> 02:27:42.433]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.124 --> 02:27:49.726]  How come every time you need to fill up your tank, you discover gas prices have gone up again?
[02:27:50.046 --> 02:27:52.527]  It's not only frustrating, but it's costing you big bucks at the pump.
[02:27:52.747 --> 02:27:53.488]  Is there hope in sight?
[02:27:53.648 --> 02:27:54.628]  Well, the solution is here.
[02:27:54.648 --> 02:27:56.449]  It's time for System 48 Plus.

[02:28:12.737 --> 02:28:21.683]  System 48 Plus cleans the engine wall and then sticks to the engine's internal components to prevent metal-to-metal wear and friction on your engine, saving you trips to the pump and to the auto repair center.
[02:28:21.903 --> 02:28:23.745]  The way this product performs, you'd expect to pay over $100.

[02:28:51.674 --> 02:28:57.858]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.118 --> 02:29:06.504]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.804 --> 02:29:13.851]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.

[02:29:51.451 --> 02:29:52.511]  You wear deodorant, right?

[02:29:53.611 --> 02:29:56.452]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.

[02:30:57.248 --> 02:31:01.512]  We're talking to Paul Watson and taking just a few more calls because we do have to get back into some more of the news.
[02:31:04.106 --> 02:31:06.047]  Bill and Canada, finish up what you were just saying.
[02:31:06.067 --> 02:31:08.388]  You were talking about... Okay, could I finish up, please?
[02:31:08.669 --> 02:31:09.869]  You were talking about Beelzebo.
[02:31:09.909 --> 02:31:10.369]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:31:10.469 --> 02:31:10.710]  Okay.
[02:31:11.070 --> 02:31:16.833]  When you look very carefully in history, deeply into history, why do they start war in Europe?
[02:31:17.093 --> 02:31:18.453]  The first war and second.
[02:31:18.714 --> 02:31:21.355]  Because they have no output.
[02:31:21.435 --> 02:31:23.476]  It means they have no market for their product.
[02:31:23.816 --> 02:31:27.278]  And there were too many high levels of unemployment all across Europe.
[02:31:27.798 --> 02:31:29.839]  My father was a colonel in the German army.
[02:31:30.239 --> 02:31:31.200]  My father was saying that
[02:31:32.062 --> 02:31:33.583]  They couldn't handle the unemployment.
[02:31:33.603 --> 02:31:35.144]  It was so costly for the bankers.
[02:31:35.384 --> 02:31:38.626]  And the bankers say, why should we waste money with useless eaters?
[02:31:39.326 --> 02:31:42.028]  It's going to happen something in the United States and Canada.
[02:31:42.668 --> 02:31:44.269]  We're going to have a civil war here.
[02:31:44.309 --> 02:31:47.271]  Well, war also consolidates power.
[02:31:47.992 --> 02:31:52.414]  Yes, because first they don't care about... Well, you said your father was a colonel in the German army.
[02:31:52.454 --> 02:31:53.595]  What, did he run to Brazil?
[02:31:54.235 --> 02:31:54.956]  Yes, he did.
[02:31:56.017 --> 02:31:57.117]  He did after the war.
[02:31:58.038 --> 02:32:01.660]  And when he came to Brazil, Van Eybrecht didn't like what he was doing.
[02:32:02.813 --> 02:32:13.175]  My neighbor tried to get rid of him because he was exposing lots of things about Catholic churches being highly involved in that, the Jesuits, and I went to the Jesuit school at the age of five.
[02:32:14.015 --> 02:32:16.175]  Well, tell me, who was your father?
[02:32:16.975 --> 02:32:18.036]  I cannot mention that.
[02:32:18.176 --> 02:32:31.498]  His dad, six years ago, and he used to say that the international bankers, the money cartel, are, will, and are destroyed, and will continually destroy until the end,
[02:32:32.561 --> 02:32:35.842]  Well, did he understand that Hitler was controlled by these same people?
[02:32:36.182 --> 02:32:37.083]  Yes, yes.
[02:32:37.163 --> 02:32:53.628]  He mentioned on the river when he was fishing one time, he told about this for my brother and for me, he says, we will have no peace in this war until they will finish over 5 billion people because they are overpopulated.
[02:32:53.688 --> 02:32:58.350]  The master plan by the United Nations Committee and the UN Conference has changed.
[02:32:58.891 --> 02:33:03.017]  We have to have 500 million to 700 million people in the planet.
[02:33:03.698 --> 02:33:04.959]  Because overpopulation.
[02:33:05.220 --> 02:33:08.745]  In United States alone, there'll be maybe 30 million people left.
[02:33:09.265 --> 02:33:13.932]  Believe me, the master plan is to destroy, depopulate, and
[02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:21.205]  But to do that extermination, they've got to get their police state in place first, in the name of stopping the terrorism.
[02:33:21.845 --> 02:33:26.609]  And I would tell you, Kurt Waldheim, big Nazi, they guarded him, they had him as the UN chief.
[02:33:27.149 --> 02:33:29.811]  Yes, they already have everything in place, Alex.
[02:33:30.412 --> 02:33:42.841]  Here in Toronto, they were writing about these trucks, refrigerated trucks, when the flu will get over two weeks ago, they have that in Astara.
[02:33:43.362 --> 02:33:46.604]  And they were saying that they're expecting high level of flu.
[02:33:46.824 --> 02:33:48.786]  But they will create that flu themselves.
[02:33:48.866 --> 02:33:49.806]  Everything is ready.
[02:33:50.667 --> 02:33:52.828]  Everything is ready to destroy.
[02:33:53.068 --> 02:33:59.232]  When they were calling SARS, when I asked a doctor, there is no such a word in medical books as SARS.
[02:33:59.473 --> 02:34:00.413]  It's influenza.
[02:34:00.433 --> 02:34:02.575]  You know what a doctor look at me and he says?
[02:34:02.875 --> 02:34:03.655]  He's a friend of mine.
[02:34:04.276 --> 02:34:06.897]  He says, I cannot comment on that.
[02:34:07.698 --> 02:34:08.519]  And I say, why not?
[02:34:08.659 --> 02:34:09.519]  It's influenza.
[02:34:09.559 --> 02:34:12.041]  They've been digging for virus for years ago.
[02:34:14.275 --> 02:34:31.407]  Well, they also dug up... They dug up the virus... They also dug it up at the North Pole.
[02:34:31.427 --> 02:34:32.888]  They just dug it out of a dead whaler.
[02:34:33.188 --> 02:34:34.089]  Listen, interesting call.
[02:34:34.129 --> 02:34:34.729]  Thanks for the call.
[02:34:34.749 --> 02:34:35.630]  We're running out of time here.
[02:34:35.650 --> 02:34:36.610]  You're welcome to call back.
[02:34:37.071 --> 02:34:39.092]  You called about a year ago, and it was interesting talking to you.
[02:34:39.112 --> 02:34:41.754]  So call back sooner than a year, okay, Bill?
[02:34:42.646 --> 02:34:43.187]  You're a gentleman.
[02:34:43.247 --> 02:34:44.388]  I highly respect you, brother.
[02:34:44.428 --> 02:34:46.510]  All right, well, I appreciate the call.
[02:34:46.750 --> 02:34:47.610]  You don't have to thank me.
[02:34:48.031 --> 02:34:51.734]  Everybody, you know, these neocons make you worship them to even get on the air.
[02:34:51.754 --> 02:34:52.615]  You don't have to do that here.
[02:34:53.395 --> 02:34:56.878]  Anybody can call in as long as it's not one of our stalkers or government ops.
[02:34:56.938 --> 02:34:59.440]  And I know who they are, and when they call, I deal with it.
[02:34:59.741 --> 02:35:03.824]  But, Paul Watson, let's talk about the Globalist Master Plan a little bit.
[02:35:04.725 --> 02:35:07.127]  For people that don't understand it, why don't you give us your take on it?
[02:35:08.795 --> 02:35:25.585]  Well, I mean, the goal is world government and the current geopolitical landscape looks as if it's going to be the US versus China and Russia and after that whole thing flares up.
[02:35:26.663 --> 02:35:34.129]  The European Union and the United Nations will be there to pick up the pieces and then become the new world government.
[02:35:34.649 --> 02:35:42.135]  Whether it will happen due to Russia fueling these Iranian reactors this year remains to be seen.
[02:35:42.155 --> 02:35:43.976]  It'll probably take something bigger than that.
[02:35:44.737 --> 02:35:46.658]  But I mean, you have instability all around the world.
[02:35:46.739 --> 02:35:50.662]  I mean, you have China and Japan in another spat with each other.
[02:35:51.402 --> 02:35:55.145]  Japan and South Korea in geopolitical spats with each other.
[02:35:55.948 --> 02:36:03.233]  So, I mean, the tensions are definitely rising worldwide and people are aligning, the countries are aligning against each other.
[02:36:03.553 --> 02:36:06.656]  And the globalists are running around serving out the nuclear weapons.
[02:36:07.756 --> 02:36:08.517]  Well, that's right.
[02:36:08.537 --> 02:36:12.760]  I mean, the international arms market is what fuels all this.
[02:36:12.900 --> 02:36:21.006]  It's how Pakistan and India got each other's throats back in 2002 because the British and the American were arming both sides.
[02:36:22.114 --> 02:36:34.414]  And that developed onto the tensions, you know, the development of tensions between Pakistan and the US now that it's going the way of apparently not being our ally in the war on terror because...
[02:36:35.640 --> 02:36:42.322]  Apparently they've been capturing top al-Qaeda members and letting them go free, which we see stories about every few months.
[02:36:42.362 --> 02:36:45.122]  So Pakistan is moving further towards China.
[02:36:45.402 --> 02:36:47.443]  But then that's what they're supposed to do.
[02:36:47.503 --> 02:36:53.264]  I mean, there's a CIA dictatorship over there, and they've been ordered to protect al-Qaeda, and that's come out in the mainstream news.
[02:36:54.484 --> 02:36:54.725]  Yeah.
[02:36:55.265 --> 02:37:03.487]  But then on a global level, it allies them more closely with China to, you know, prop up China against the U.S.
[02:37:03.827 --> 02:37:05.087]  I mean, that's what I see happening.
[02:37:06.195 --> 02:37:09.296]  You know, the globalists have got everything, but they always want more.
[02:37:09.496 --> 02:37:11.736]  And they love destruction, Paul.
[02:37:12.076 --> 02:37:14.597]  They're cooking up quite a banquet of death.
[02:37:16.157 --> 02:37:20.598]  Yeah, I mean, it just remains to be seen how much longer we can back them off.
[02:37:21.419 --> 02:37:25.180]  Certainly, I think we've been successful since 9-11 as a benchmark.
[02:37:25.200 --> 02:37:35.002]  I mean, back in those days, it appeared that there was going to be a terrorist attack every day from the propaganda that was coming out, but we've backed them off nearly four years now.
[02:37:35.712 --> 02:37:39.015]  I know a lot of the stuff they wanted to get through has not got through.
[02:37:39.035 --> 02:37:43.538]  They're trying to expand the Patriot Act, but we're having problems with that.
[02:37:44.479 --> 02:37:49.062]  So, I mean, we're withholding a lot of the tyranny, which would have overwashed us.
[02:37:49.883 --> 02:37:50.944]  Well, here's the problem.
[02:37:50.964 --> 02:37:52.185]  They need troops for Iraq.
[02:37:52.225 --> 02:37:53.786]  They need troops for the next invasion.
[02:37:54.627 --> 02:37:56.428]  Their programs are not going well.
[02:37:56.588 --> 02:37:59.931]  It looks to me like, though, they're probably going to pull something off big.
[02:38:01.801 --> 02:38:12.969]  Well, yeah, and the only... I mean, what you need 600... The number was 660,000 troops just to go into North Korea, which would get them on the border with China.
[02:38:12.989 --> 02:38:15.991]  And the only way that's going to be achieved is with the draft.
[02:38:16.551 --> 02:38:29.160]  There's no other way to get it done unless you have client countries or the United Nations go in and take over Iraq and get the troops out of Iraq, which may be the reason for the continued bloodshed.
[02:38:30.367 --> 02:38:37.511]  As we've mentioned in the past, it may be a staged theater for the global cry for the United Nations to go in and take over.
[02:38:38.311 --> 02:38:39.351]  So then the U.S.
[02:38:39.371 --> 02:38:41.853]  can get those troops out and move them around the chessboard.
[02:38:43.934 --> 02:38:44.974]  It's amazing, Paul.
[02:38:45.454 --> 02:38:46.715]  Shifting gears, 1,000 U.S.
[02:38:47.055 --> 02:38:48.696]  troops launch offensive in Iraq.
[02:38:49.521 --> 02:39:02.571]  Marines and sailors and soldiers encircled the river city in the troubled Anar province before dawn today, launching a major anti-insurgent operation in the vast western region in less than a month.
[02:39:03.192 --> 02:39:14.821]  Helicopters swept down the palm tree groves, dropped Marines who blocked off one side of Aditha, while other troops on foot in armored vehicles established checkpoints and moved toward the city center.
[02:39:15.121 --> 02:39:17.343]  I mean, they don't even control most of the cities, Paul.
[02:39:17.383 --> 02:39:18.944]  It's just continual guerrilla warfare.
[02:39:19.827 --> 02:39:27.923]  Well, no, and this is the fallacy that we get from journalists and propagandists who come back into the US after visiting Iraq and say,
[02:39:28.962 --> 02:39:31.323]  You know, the liberal media is lying.
[02:39:31.403 --> 02:39:33.084]  It's all very calm and peaceful.
[02:39:33.124 --> 02:39:34.405]  There's nothing really happening.
[02:39:34.485 --> 02:39:35.766]  Everything is under control.
[02:39:36.226 --> 02:39:47.092]  They never leave the green zone, which is basically the only part of Iraq which they really fully control because it's heavily fortified and guarded, and that's the only place where the journalists ever go.
[02:39:47.232 --> 02:39:53.375]  So, of course, if you go in there and think that's an example for the entire country, you're going to think everything's under control.
[02:39:53.735 --> 02:39:54.756]  The facts are it isn't.
[02:39:55.176 --> 02:39:57.137]  Bars everywhere, topless bars.
[02:39:57.797 --> 02:40:03.080]  Huge walls, but even there, every day or so, mortars and car bombs are exploding.
[02:40:03.981 --> 02:40:06.082]  Yes, I mean, they can't even protect that.
[02:40:09.044 --> 02:40:16.328]  I tell you, Paul, what do you and your little crystal ball think is going to happen in the next couple of years in Iraq?
[02:40:17.789 --> 02:40:25.133]  The British said recently that it's going to drag on until 2010 before any kind of withdrawal.
[02:40:27.245 --> 02:40:28.987]  I believe it'll stay the same.
[02:40:29.007 --> 02:40:30.808]  It is a Vietnam situation.
[02:40:31.329 --> 02:40:33.210]  Maybe it was designed to be all along.
[02:40:34.391 --> 02:40:37.414]  And eventually, the United Nations will go in there.
[02:40:38.334 --> 02:40:41.277]  Or, you know, another government will be elected and the U.S.
[02:40:41.317 --> 02:40:42.198]  will be kicked out.
[02:40:43.939 --> 02:40:46.381]  Meanwhile, Bush has ordered the Border Patrol to stand down.
[02:40:46.401 --> 02:40:47.862]  And from their own website, U.S.
[02:40:47.902 --> 02:40:49.324]  Joint Forces Command and U.S.
[02:40:49.344 --> 02:40:54.328]  Marine Corps began co-sponsoring the Joint Urban Warrior Seminar War Game.
[02:40:55.303 --> 02:40:59.347]  It is the second in the JUW series going on right now.
[02:41:00.208 --> 02:41:11.700]  And the goal of the series is to give joint and combined force commanders a knowledge base of separating adversaries from the rest of the population, that's arresting citizens, and minimizing unnecessary destructive effects.
[02:41:12.241 --> 02:41:18.347]  Additionally, lessons from JUW 5 will improve the design of future urban experiments influencing ongoing development.
[02:41:18.687 --> 02:41:25.191]  Of the Joint Urban Training Strategy and suggest improvements to the Department of Defense Joint Urban Operations Master Plan.
[02:41:25.211 --> 02:41:27.673]  According to Don Streetman, the U.S.
[02:41:27.713 --> 02:41:39.481]  Joint Forces Command's Joint Experiment Directorate is intended to provide a vehicle for communicating and integrating the activities of different services and agencies addressing urban operations, concept development, and experimentation.
[02:41:39.941 --> 02:41:40.462]  Well, that's right.
[02:41:40.482 --> 02:41:43.745]  It's just whether you believe that they'll take the route of...
[02:42:01.454 --> 02:42:06.097]  Policing the people physically or mentally.
[02:42:06.477 --> 02:42:10.099]  I mean, they've seen throughout history that the jackbooted approach doesn't work.
[02:42:10.359 --> 02:42:12.500]  It works temporarily, but not in the long term.
[02:42:13.481 --> 02:42:23.227]  So, I mean, if that's the way they want to go, then I would welcome it if it came down to the wire, because it's never worked throughout history, and I don't think it's going to work now.
[02:42:23.267 --> 02:42:25.668]  I know the propaganda is so much more sophisticated.
[02:42:26.638 --> 02:42:35.426]  But still, to have that visceral, jackbooted approach where people can see that it's a dictatorship right up close and personal, then they'll react to that.
[02:42:35.506 --> 02:42:37.227]  I don't think it's going to work in the long term.
[02:42:38.268 --> 02:42:41.411]  But, very quietly for decades, they've been gearing up for it.
[02:42:42.772 --> 02:42:48.697]  Exactly, and I mean it's... Obviously they're going to identify minorities of insurgents.
[02:42:49.238 --> 02:42:51.580]  I mean, in ten years' time, we'll be the insurgents.
[02:42:52.600 --> 02:42:54.242]  And it could develop from...
[02:42:55.094 --> 02:43:15.872]  People not taking the ID card, people not taking the implantable chip, so they do have a minority that they can focus this on, this police state, these urban warfare drills, and demonise us so the rest of the population in fact support the suppression that will ensue from that in a Tiananmen Square style situation.
[02:43:16.980 --> 02:43:19.742]  So to use it wholesale, I think, is out of the question.
[02:43:19.782 --> 02:43:26.145]  To use it on minorities, which they define as terrorists within the U.S., is entirely possible.
[02:43:26.686 --> 02:43:28.206]  That's what it's geared towards, I think.
[02:43:28.867 --> 02:43:30.988]  I agree, but that itself will fail.
[02:43:33.049 --> 02:43:35.771]  We're about to take one final call from Bill in Wisconsin.
[02:43:35.791 --> 02:43:38.472]  That's all I have time to take, but I've got several other articles here.
[02:43:38.512 --> 02:43:43.295]  Before we do that, Paul, prisonplanet.tv, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[02:43:44.384 --> 02:43:47.505]  It is only 15 cents a day with a yearly subscription.
[02:43:47.545 --> 02:43:48.825]  You really get three months for free.
[02:43:49.785 --> 02:43:51.805]  19 cents a day with a monthly trial subscription.
[02:43:52.865 --> 02:43:59.307]  All 12 of my films, dozens of other films, my book, Paul Watson's book, I mean, an e-book's normally $5.95, folks.
[02:43:59.887 --> 02:44:05.248]  A bunch of other e-books, my weekly TV reports, my best audio interviews, special text reports.
[02:44:05.748 --> 02:44:13.529]  It gets better and better every day, and it takes, what, about a minute and a half to sign up via PayPal or credit card via prisonplanet.tv, Paul?
[02:44:14.494 --> 02:44:15.814]  That's right, or even less.
[02:44:17.075 --> 02:44:21.376]  As I said before, I mean, it's chock full, it's been going over a year.
[02:44:21.756 --> 02:44:25.097]  It's a library archive of material.
[02:44:25.717 --> 02:44:32.618]  You can download all the video and audio files, play them on your MP3 player, burn them, save them.
[02:44:33.159 --> 02:44:38.040]  So, I mean, even if you wanted to subscribe for just one month, you could get everything for $5.95.
[02:44:39.821 --> 02:44:40.622]  And that's our goal.
[02:44:40.662 --> 02:44:42.423]  We just want the information out there.
[02:44:42.523 --> 02:44:48.948]  You are creating private libraries everywhere as a brain trust of information and helping spread that.
[02:44:49.349 --> 02:44:53.352]  So prisonplanet.tv or call toll free to get my new Marshall Law film.
[02:44:53.632 --> 02:44:55.594]  Paul, do you have that Jeff Rents quote?
[02:44:56.234 --> 02:45:00.518]  Because I really haven't solicited reviews, though we're getting hundreds of positive reviews.
[02:45:00.818 --> 02:45:07.483]  But Jeff was a TV exec, anchorman, and I was blown away by his lavish 30-minute review the other night.
[02:45:07.904 --> 02:45:09.325]  Can you read us that quote?
[02:45:10.587 --> 02:45:20.189]  Yeah, Jeff Renz on martial law, quote, the greatest single serving of political truth and awareness that I have yet come across in my life.
[02:45:22.989 --> 02:45:26.810]  So, again, folks, you need to get martial law.
[02:45:27.430 --> 02:45:30.331]  We document savagely who carried out 9-11.
[02:45:30.631 --> 02:45:34.211]  We document who the globalists are, what their mindset is, this culture of death.
[02:45:34.491 --> 02:45:35.751]  We show the police state.
[02:45:35.791 --> 02:45:37.112]  We show their real programs.
[02:45:37.392 --> 02:45:38.572]  We document the torture.
[02:45:39.412 --> 02:45:41.413]  Toll-free number to order, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:41.433 --> 02:45:42.893]  As they say in England, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:45:42.993 --> 02:45:46.055]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:46:01.095 --> 02:46:03.977]  And I want to commend all of you that have gotten the films and have made copies.
[02:46:04.017 --> 02:46:04.478]  Keep it up.
[02:46:04.778 --> 02:46:07.480]  Those that have gotten the film and haven't made copies, please make copies.
[02:46:07.740 --> 02:46:09.902]  Those that haven't gotten the films, order them today.
[02:46:09.922 --> 02:46:10.662]  888-253-3139.
[02:46:11.102 --> 02:46:15.586]  Or go to Infowars.com to order hard copies.
[02:46:15.946 --> 02:46:17.507]  I want to thank all of you that have gotten the films.
[02:46:17.527 --> 02:46:18.488]  You make what we do possible.
[02:46:18.828 --> 02:46:20.329]  Bill in Wisconsin, you're on the air.
[02:46:20.389 --> 02:46:20.790]  Go ahead.
[02:46:21.610 --> 02:46:22.070]  Hello, John.
[02:46:23.211 --> 02:46:23.532]  May I?
[02:46:23.932 --> 02:46:24.672]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:24.712 --> 02:46:25.373]  My name is John.
[02:46:25.853 --> 02:46:26.294]  Okay, John.
[02:46:26.554 --> 02:46:26.654]  Um...
[02:46:27.116 --> 02:46:32.258]  I went to the stores the other day, and these vets were out there giving away flags for donations and stuff.
[02:46:33.058 --> 02:46:35.699]  And I asked the vet, do you know about depleted uranium?
[02:46:36.479 --> 02:46:37.680]  And he was really quiet.
[02:46:37.700 --> 02:46:38.840]  He kind of got violent.
[02:46:38.860 --> 02:46:40.240]  He shook his head yes, though.
[02:46:40.641 --> 02:46:43.962]  And all of a sudden, this guy comes up next to me, and he goes, grabs the flag, gives a donation.
[02:46:44.662 --> 02:46:46.102]  Says, my kid's going to Iraq.
[02:46:46.663 --> 02:46:47.303]  I said, oh, yeah?
[02:46:47.423 --> 02:46:51.064]  Company B2 at the 127th, which is the unit I served in here in Green Bay.
[02:46:51.624 --> 02:46:52.985]  And he goes, yeah, that's the one.
[02:46:53.005 --> 02:46:53.345]  You know it?
[02:46:53.445 --> 02:46:54.465]  I said, yeah, it's there nine years.
[02:46:54.565 --> 02:46:56.706]  I said, you know what depleted uranium is?
[02:46:57.363 --> 02:46:58.385]  And the guy says, no.
[02:46:59.106 --> 02:47:00.247]  So I had to explain it to him.
[02:47:01.088 --> 02:47:03.192]  And he didn't believe me, so I point to the vet.
[02:47:03.953 --> 02:47:05.996]  The vet checks and said, yeah, leave this guy.
[02:47:06.717 --> 02:47:08.820]  Then he went from, yeah, my kid's going to Iraq.
[02:47:08.900 --> 02:47:10.162]  So he's all crying.
[02:47:10.751 --> 02:47:12.292]  You know, he just almost broke down.
[02:47:12.552 --> 02:47:20.998]  Yeah, our government uses something that they know will kill many of our troops and has tripled the birth deformities and they bombed the bases this time where your son's going to live.
[02:47:21.298 --> 02:47:22.679]  You can say bye to your son.
[02:47:23.560 --> 02:47:24.661]  You'll probably outlive him.
[02:47:24.681 --> 02:47:25.961]  He'll die in your arms.
[02:47:26.382 --> 02:47:27.783]  Yeah, I forgot to say hi, Dr. Watson.
[02:47:28.443 --> 02:47:30.464]  And I went down to my unit.
[02:47:30.545 --> 02:47:31.205]  I got two guys.
[02:47:31.465 --> 02:47:32.746]  I've been out for 12 years.
[02:47:33.587 --> 02:47:34.807]  And there's two guys in there yet.
[02:47:34.827 --> 02:47:35.728]  So I got a hold of them.
[02:47:36.268 --> 02:47:37.449]  And I explained to them what's going on.
[02:47:37.489 --> 02:47:38.290]  They had no clue.
[02:47:39.090 --> 02:47:39.851]  No clue whatsoever.
[02:47:41.356 --> 02:47:50.505]  Well, again, the original Army manuals from the mid-'80s, early-'90s say it's deadly, you've got to cover yourself, only use it in limited areas.
[02:47:50.886 --> 02:47:53.949]  Now they've removed those manuals and don't even give them any safety training.
[02:47:54.750 --> 02:47:57.833]  They bombed hundreds of bases and had our troops move right into them.
[02:47:58.273 --> 02:48:00.736]  And one guy said, well, I'm going to be in POC operations.
[02:48:00.796 --> 02:48:01.376]  I should be safe.
[02:48:01.396 --> 02:48:02.738]  I said, did you ever hear of the wind?
[02:48:04.163 --> 02:48:05.023]  You know, wake up.
[02:48:05.063 --> 02:48:10.448]  Well, the incredible thing is our generals even move into the places they've bombed, which I guess we've got to commend them.
[02:48:11.008 --> 02:48:14.611]  I mean, it's a crazy denial, Paul.
[02:48:15.972 --> 02:48:21.817]  Well, I mean, you just have to remember that they don't see the mangled Iraqi babies born after this DU exposure.
[02:48:22.057 --> 02:48:23.878]  They're sold on the Pat Tillman story.
[02:48:23.918 --> 02:48:24.779]  That's all they know.
[02:48:24.799 --> 02:48:27.742]  I mean, they don't see stories like, you know, this one.
[02:48:27.762 --> 02:48:31.845]  Vets sue Rumsfeld over health care cuts cutting the veterans' benefits again.
[02:48:32.668 --> 02:48:38.917]  They're not exposed to that because the top of the evening news, it's all about the heroic fable of Pat Tillman and Jessica Lynch.
[02:48:40.299 --> 02:48:41.321]  Yeah, great heroes.
[02:48:41.341 --> 02:48:42.042]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:42.102 --> 02:48:42.863]  More news straight ahead.
[02:48:45.623 --> 02:48:47.104]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.305 --> 02:48:50.387]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.527 --> 02:48:54.431]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.471 --> 02:48:58.695]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.055 --> 02:49:02.838]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.918 --> 02:49:04.780]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.040 --> 02:49:08.242]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.302 --> 02:49:13.026]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.186 --> 02:49:16.228]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.408 --> 02:49:19.270]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:25.875]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.415 --> 02:49:26.915]  We're good to go.
[02:49:44.801 --> 02:49:52.307]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:52.587 --> 02:50:03.495]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:03.775 --> 02:50:05.578]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:50:05.838 --> 02:50:09.162]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:09.503 --> 02:50:19.957]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:20.257 --> 02:50:20.757]  That's right.
[02:50:20.937 --> 02:50:28.040]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.340 --> 02:50:37.084]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:37.104 --> 02:50:37.804]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[02:51:45.777 --> 02:51:47.939]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:51:48.519 --> 02:51:51.321]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.875 --> 02:52:01.502]  Don't forget, I'll be showing my new film, Martial Law, at the Alamo Draft House downtown, Friday, June 3rd at 7 and 10 p.m.
[02:52:01.842 --> 02:52:02.984]  Two separate showings.
[02:52:03.584 --> 02:52:07.368]  Link through Infowars.com to the subpage of the Alamo Draft House website.
[02:52:07.709 --> 02:52:09.871]  The purchase tickets will forehand or get them at the door.
[02:52:10.655 --> 02:52:16.698]  And if it sells out a few days before, or some of the showings sell out, I'll be sure to tell you which showing you can still go to.
[02:52:16.718 --> 02:52:24.522]  And then coming up the next Wednesday, Wednesday, June 8th, 8 p.m., Alamo Draft House South Lamar will have a showing there as well.
[02:52:24.582 --> 02:52:25.322]  It's going to be great.
[02:52:25.742 --> 02:52:26.803]  Hope to see you there.
[02:52:27.763 --> 02:52:31.545]  Paul Watson, a couple final news articles I wanted to go over.
[02:52:32.706 --> 02:52:35.567]  They didn't care if the American people didn't want a national ID card here.
[02:52:35.607 --> 02:52:36.288]  They just did it.
[02:52:36.348 --> 02:52:36.708]  But over...
[02:52:37.503 --> 02:52:52.452]  In England, Tony Blair is saying, oh, we've got to stop identity theft, but it's in our news that the banks are selling the data, and that's why most of this is happening, and the Social Security cards, and in your country, your ID numbers, are actually what is causing all of this.
[02:52:53.052 --> 02:52:55.774]  It's what is allowing thieves to do this.
[02:52:55.834 --> 02:53:02.138]  So they've really been beating this identity theft thing while allowing it to happen as a pretext to bring in these suckers.
[02:53:03.360 --> 02:53:11.744]  Well, yeah, and that's probably the plan, which will lead to the call for the implanted microchip, because the ID card won't solve identity theft.
[02:53:12.224 --> 02:53:23.789]  You know, in the face of companies like ChoicePoint losing 400,000 people's data, it will compound identity theft, which will then lead to the call for it to be more secure.
[02:53:23.869 --> 02:53:30.892]  Well, Bank of America just sold 600-something thousand people's accounts and data and everything to some front fraud group.
[02:53:32.068 --> 02:53:37.150]  Yeah, I mean, those corporations and banks get caught doing that almost on a monthly basis now.
[02:53:38.030 --> 02:53:47.613]  So it's all geared towards, you know, the call going out for more secure technology, biometrics, if they don't get that in already, and then the implantable chip.
[02:53:48.193 --> 02:53:54.195]  So they're letting them do whatever they want, causing the problem and then offering the solution, everything you do being spied on.
[02:53:54.635 --> 02:53:57.496]  But you guys have voted down the national ID card how many times?
[02:53:58.482 --> 02:54:02.826]  Well, I mean, they first talked about it back in the 80s, and there were bills introduced in the early 90s.
[02:54:03.067 --> 02:54:04.988]  They did like six times now?
[02:54:05.529 --> 02:54:08.232]  Yeah, they just keep, it just keeps popping up again and again.
[02:54:09.103 --> 02:54:12.626]  And they'll just keep putting these bills through until they get it passed.
[02:54:13.006 --> 02:54:17.769]  It's just... Shifting gears, we have a huge Diana section that you really ought to get posted back on the main page.
[02:54:18.269 --> 02:54:19.250]  And here's CBS News.
[02:54:19.290 --> 02:54:25.114]  Princess Diana is back in the headlines with a newspaper report on the possible murder conspiracy related to her death almost eight years ago.
[02:54:25.614 --> 02:54:28.296]  It's admitted she was killed, Paul, but it's still a conspiracy.
[02:54:28.336 --> 02:54:28.737]  Go ahead.
[02:54:29.957 --> 02:54:32.379]  Well, yeah, I mean, they got the quote of the bodyguard.
[02:54:32.439 --> 02:54:38.023]  Up until this very day, not one piece of evidence has been produced that would suggest that Diana and Dodie were murdered.
[02:54:39.672 --> 02:54:43.473]  Not one piece of evidence has been produced that it was an accident.
[02:54:43.733 --> 02:54:47.014]  I mean, she said Charles says he's going to kill me in a fake auto accident.
[02:54:47.674 --> 02:54:49.554]  They're going to kill me in a fake auto accident.
[02:54:49.594 --> 02:54:52.195]  There's MI6 agents crawling around the tunnel.
[02:54:52.595 --> 02:54:56.015]  Henri Paul, the driver, is getting paid by MI6.
[02:54:57.056 --> 02:55:01.597]  The hospital drives at 25 miles an hour, past four hospitals on the way.
[02:55:02.097 --> 02:55:03.657]  She dies, obviously, because of that.
[02:55:04.601 --> 02:55:07.625]  The police radios all fail before the car goes into the tunnel.
[02:55:07.645 --> 02:55:08.926]  The cameras all turn off.
[02:55:09.527 --> 02:55:10.368]  Cameras turn off.
[02:55:10.488 --> 02:55:14.052]  The crime scene is immediately cleaned straight after the crash.
[02:55:15.787 --> 02:55:16.968]  There's a few examples.
[02:55:17.008 --> 02:55:22.031]  We've got the archives on prisonplanet.com with all of them, which clearly show that it was murder.
[02:55:22.652 --> 02:55:24.413]  Partially because she was a loose cannon.
[02:55:24.433 --> 02:55:25.934]  She was speaking out in the royal family.
[02:55:26.034 --> 02:55:27.936]  Well, she did video tapes.
[02:55:28.016 --> 02:55:29.457]  If they kill me, it was Charles.
[02:55:29.477 --> 02:55:31.578]  They're going to kill me in an auto accident.
[02:55:31.779 --> 02:55:33.040]  She wrote letters, too.
[02:55:33.060 --> 02:55:34.621]  But that doesn't count!
[02:55:35.121 --> 02:55:38.524]  And she said to clear the path for Charles to remarry.
[02:55:38.884 --> 02:55:41.586]  What happened two months ago, Charles remarried.
[02:55:43.025 --> 02:55:48.250]  One more article here out of the Arizona Republic.
[02:55:48.390 --> 02:55:54.475]  Family buys beautiful 50 acres, and the feds just say, you're not allowed to go to your own property, and they just take it.
[02:55:54.495 --> 02:55:56.077]  I mean, that's your government, folks.
[02:55:56.117 --> 02:55:56.858]  That's your freedom.
[02:55:57.198 --> 02:55:58.159]  Time that we stand up.
[02:55:58.719 --> 02:56:06.101]  And resist this and get our country back, get the Western governments back that have been captured by the globalists and being used as engines of world domination.
[02:56:06.421 --> 02:56:07.501]  Paul, closing comments.
[02:56:08.182 --> 02:56:11.222]  Well, I mean, just to use a British phrase, keep your chin up.
[02:56:11.402 --> 02:56:14.403]  I mean, I remain hopeful that we're waking a lot of people up, having a great effect.
[02:56:15.343 --> 02:56:17.604]  We are, Paul, and people are listening like never before.
[02:56:19.768 --> 02:56:20.068]  All right.
[02:56:20.128 --> 02:56:21.189]  Vaya con Dios, my friend.
[02:56:21.209 --> 02:56:22.049]  Good job as usual.
[02:56:22.089 --> 02:56:22.529]  Take care.
[02:56:22.549 --> 02:56:23.350]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:56:23.650 --> 02:56:24.030]  You bet.
[02:56:24.050 --> 02:56:27.852]  We've been adding a lot of neat things to prisonplanet.com and prisonplanet.tv.
[02:56:28.272 --> 02:56:29.152]  So be sure and check them out.
[02:56:29.633 --> 02:56:31.213]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:31.553 --> 02:56:33.534]  God bless you all!
