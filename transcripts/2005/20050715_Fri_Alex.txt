[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.380]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:08.102]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.823 --> 00:00:09.924]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:11.426]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.167 --> 00:00:13.047]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.067 --> 00:00:17.472]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.913 --> 00:00:22.017]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.181]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:26.381 --> 00:00:29.503]  It's already Friday, the 15th day of July, 2005.
[00:00:29.643 --> 00:00:33.885]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:36.867]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:37.607]  State Rep.
[00:00:52.029 --> 00:01:06.841]  Court is going to be joining us to talk about a legislative fight here at the state level against the Supreme Court's ruling that, well, if local governments want to take your private property for private use, they can do it if some land baron wants it.
[00:01:07.442 --> 00:01:12.225]  But that'll be a mini-interview for just one segment coming up later, but it's very important.
[00:01:13.126 --> 00:01:21.293]  There's been so many developments with Karl Rove, so many developments on the expansion of NAFTA into the free trade area of the Americas via CAFTA.
[00:01:22.768 --> 00:01:25.089]  There's so much happening, we're going to cover it all.
[00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:28.390]  Top Chinese general warns U.S.
[00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.572]  over attack, says that they will destroy hundreds of our cities.
[00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:38.694]  Meanwhile, our Fortune 500 have transferred most of our factories over there.
[00:01:39.334 --> 00:01:42.095]  Bush has taken all restrictions off supercomputers.
[00:01:42.135 --> 00:01:43.676]  Bill Clinton only took some off.
[00:01:45.236 --> 00:01:49.658]  You're liberal if you don't give them all the supercomputers, and you're liberal if you don't hand your guns in.
[00:01:49.678 --> 00:01:51.799]  It's the new conservatism.
[00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:57.951]  And so we'll go over these amazing comments, and just a lot of stuff has come out now.
[00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:15.260]  The picture is getting clearer and clearer of a government inside job concerning the tragic events that took place now eight days ago over in the United Kingdom, the London bombings.
[00:02:16.795 --> 00:02:29.282]  But don't worry, our government says there's more than a thousand people with possible terror ties in the United States who have explosives readily available, and they could be hitting our transportation systems any minute.
[00:02:29.783 --> 00:02:37.887]  The only answer is to give up all of our freedoms now, and accept the police state, but the borders will stay wide open.
[00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:43.751]  They're having terror drills all over the country, which psychologically create the subconscious fear
[00:02:44.253 --> 00:02:47.554]  A mental illusion of a climate of terror.
[00:02:48.054 --> 00:02:52.035]  But don't worry, the government's there to coddle you and take all your freedoms.
[00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:56.256]  A hunted chemistry expert has been arrested.
[00:02:56.296 --> 00:03:04.359]  The guy they think, the Egyptian chemistry expert who the police were searching for, why they've... Police have gotten him in Cairo.
[00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:08.200]  So boy, see, they're really investigating to keep you safe.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.581]  Again, I mentioned this, but here's the headline.
[00:03:11.621 --> 00:03:12.641]  Tulsa attacked with...
[00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.691]  ...ubonic plague in biodrill.
[00:03:17.451 --> 00:03:18.971]  So we'll be going over that.
[00:03:19.692 --> 00:03:24.213]  Also, Iraq to probe alleged police torture and killings.
[00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:33.095]  Australia in the aftermath of the bombings to consider national ID card to fight terrorism as England rampages forward with it.
[00:03:33.495 --> 00:03:36.336]  And some good news, but of course he's drawing fire for it,
[00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:50.833]  Town uses trespassing law to fight illegal immigration, and the police chief said that he was sick of stopping illegal aliens who were committing crimes, and the feds would say, well, they're not really illegal, just let them go.
[00:03:50.893 --> 00:03:53.815]  And he said, no, we're going to charge them with trespassing.
[00:03:54.555 --> 00:03:57.177]  That's got the globalists hopping mad.
[00:03:57.217 --> 00:04:03.040]  It's only the citizens that are under all these draconian laws, not the precious illegal aliens.
[00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.234]  They get all the freebies, all the incentives, because the New World Order wants to bring them here.
[00:04:08.734 --> 00:04:13.118]  Oh, by the way, it's not just Australia and England and everybody else adopting these national ID cards.
[00:04:13.578 --> 00:04:17.281]  Thailand adopts emergency powers to fight the evil terrorist.
[00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:18.842]  Everybody's joining in on the fun.
[00:04:18.862 --> 00:04:24.967]  A FBI email proves wrongful arrest in Madrid bombing.
[00:04:25.007 --> 00:04:26.168]  More frame-ups there.
[00:04:27.596 --> 00:04:30.158]  And, oh, the big news, though, none of this is important.
[00:04:30.458 --> 00:04:35.642]  Houston rapper fired his baggage screener because he's the Arabic assassin.
[00:04:35.682 --> 00:04:40.685]  Meanwhile, Russia to reintroduce Soviet-era military training schools.
[00:04:41.706 --> 00:04:45.869]  And the neocons are out fear-mongering the Al-Qaeda nukes already in U.S.
[00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:49.932]  Terrorist bombs smuggled across Mexico border by MS-13 gangsters.
[00:04:52.052 --> 00:04:53.113]  That's okay.
[00:04:53.153 --> 00:04:54.773]  We've got to keep that border wide open.
[00:04:55.194 --> 00:04:56.454]  We hope some nukes go off.
[00:04:56.474 --> 00:04:58.975]  The globalists do, because then they'll get to enslave us even more.
[00:04:59.376 --> 00:04:59.996]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.017 --> 00:05:09.421]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.661 --> 00:05:14.403]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalists' master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.623 --> 00:05:20.286]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.506 --> 00:05:21.246]  We're good to go.
[00:05:45.697 --> 00:05:46.037]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:06:02.463 --> 00:06:03.505]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:03.825 --> 00:06:06.629]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.056]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.477 --> 00:06:12.298]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:17.206]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.666 --> 00:06:19.807]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.287 --> 00:06:34.992]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.032 --> 00:06:42.075]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:43.576]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:02.841]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:07:02.882 --> 00:07:06.485]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:06.965]  Shocking?
[00:07:07.065 --> 00:07:07.526]  Of course!
[00:07:07.786 --> 00:07:09.868]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:07:10.008 --> 00:07:12.911]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:14.472]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[00:07:14.632 --> 00:07:18.896]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott Ph.D.
[00:07:19.077 --> 00:07:20.498]  only through Mother Earth Minerals.

[00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:03.571]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.131 --> 00:08:07.011]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.932 --> 00:08:14.913]  Wide open phones on this Friday edition, the 15th day of July, 2005.
[00:08:16.977 --> 00:08:22.160]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and we're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.523]  To be precise, two hours and 51 minutes, 25 seconds.
[00:08:28.583 --> 00:08:30.144]  Coming up, we do have State Rep.
[00:08:30.264 --> 00:08:37.768]  Frank Court coming on to talk about Texas' fight against the Supreme Court's announcements of no more private property.
[00:08:39.569 --> 00:08:40.990]  Well, three and a half weeks ago now,
[00:08:42.719 --> 00:08:43.920]  Well, it's conclusive.
[00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:59.690]  They show us a grainy surveillance photo of someone with a backpack, and there is your conclusive proof that they bombed these three buses, excuse me, these three trains and this one bus.
[00:09:00.771 --> 00:09:03.233]  There is your conclusive proof.
[00:09:03.903 --> 00:09:06.805]  Of course, London is about 20% Muslim.
[00:09:06.825 --> 00:09:08.706]  The country itself is only about, what, 4 or 5%.
[00:09:09.346 --> 00:09:13.129]  But London is about 20% Muslim, according to the statistics I've seen.
[00:09:13.669 --> 00:09:18.052]  And so now you have these buses and trains swarming with Muslims.
[00:09:18.132 --> 00:09:26.557]  And so anytime you've got surveillance video of one of these guys getting on a bus, why, there is your proof that they are suicide bombers.
[00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:39.831]  And ABC News is reporting that there's probably a thousand of these people, the neocons are saying between 20 and 50 thousand, Al-Qaeda operatives just all over the place.
[00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:50.299]  But Tony Blair last night told MSNBC that he admitted the truth, I guess it slipped out of him, that Al-Qaeda isn't really a group, it's a philosophy.
[00:09:50.859 --> 00:09:51.700]  Because that's true.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.444]  Al-Qaeda is the name of a CIA file, this is admitted by the way,
[00:09:57.859 --> 00:10:11.462]  A CIA file that Mujahideen's different profiles were put in back during the mid-1980s, led by the charismatic CIA officer Tim Osmond.
[00:10:12.302 --> 00:10:13.302]  That's his code name.
[00:10:13.682 --> 00:10:15.943]  You know him as Osama bin Laden.
[00:10:17.563 --> 00:10:25.505]  So it's pretty amazing, and there are so many developments that we just barely scratched the surface on yesterday concerning this Madrid bombing.
[00:10:26.512 --> 00:10:32.597]  And a lot of new developments since the broadcast yesterday, so we're going to be going over those.
[00:10:33.077 --> 00:10:43.805]  Meanwhile, one of the top Chinese generals is saying they will destroy several hundred of our cities if we get involved in defending Taiwan.
[00:10:44.786 --> 00:10:52.772]  And the neocons are out fear-mongering, saying Al-Qaeda nukes already in the U.S., and that the Mexican MS-13 gangs have brought them across.
[00:10:52.832 --> 00:10:54.353]  Now, I don't like MS-13s.
[00:10:55.743 --> 00:10:57.204]  I know they work with Los Zetas.
[00:10:57.464 --> 00:10:59.345]  I know that they're CIA controlled.
[00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:00.986]  That is even admitted now.
[00:11:01.166 --> 00:11:01.966]  Mainstream news.
[00:11:02.587 --> 00:11:05.648]  CIA trained, funded, Pentagon protected.
[00:11:06.309 --> 00:11:12.992]  And they're there to go after the cartels and the people that don't pay their cut into the real gangsters' bank accounts.
[00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:20.136]  But to say that Los Zetas and MS-13 are sneaking nukes across, I mean, that's a fable.
[00:11:21.037 --> 00:11:25.019]  But we've got more focus on this than we do on...
[00:11:25.988 --> 00:11:35.450]  A press conference given by, what, the number three man in the Chinese Communist military saying they're preparing to nuke the United States.
[00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:39.712]  I mean, he gives a press conference and says this.
[00:11:39.912 --> 00:11:50.654]  And the Financial Times of London says, and MSNBC say, oh, well, you know, he doesn't necessarily represent the views of the other brass.
[00:11:51.134 --> 00:11:53.275]  Well, they haven't talked like this in ten years.
[00:11:54.835 --> 00:11:59.096]  Folks, the Chinese military talks like this about every six months.
[00:12:00.596 --> 00:12:00.976]  Okay?
[00:12:02.077 --> 00:12:06.558]  And they're a much greater threat than Al-Qaeda.
[00:12:07.638 --> 00:12:11.439]  A much greater threat than MS-13 and Los Zetas.
[00:12:13.999 --> 00:12:16.200]  And Bill Clinton got in a lot of trouble.
[00:12:16.983 --> 00:12:32.119]  For giving some supercomputers, allowing the transfer of some supercomputers that were needed to miniaturize warheads so that they could then be put into MERV technology, or multiple re-entry devices.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.985]  You see, without a MERV encased pod...
[00:12:38.996 --> 00:12:52.046]  They may have their long-march, long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles that can be fired from their bases in Tibet over the ice cap, over the North Pole, and hit any U.S.
[00:12:52.086 --> 00:12:55.288]  city in about 24 minutes, by the way.
[00:12:56.169 --> 00:13:00.472]  From launch time to detonation, you know, a half mile over your major city.
[00:13:02.073 --> 00:13:05.075]  But if they launch these long-march, which they have over 100 of,
[00:13:06.865 --> 00:13:12.850]  Each long march until the globalists gave them the MERV technology would just be able to hit one target.
[00:13:14.211 --> 00:13:24.719]  And we do have anti-missile technology that could knock out easily most of those long-range missiles as they came in.
[00:13:24.819 --> 00:13:32.105]  But with MERV, when it starts coming back into the upper atmosphere, when it comes, you know...
[00:13:33.604 --> 00:14:01.390]  Back out of space into our atmosphere, the nose cone pops off of the second stage, depending on which missile it is, in some cases the third stage, the nose cone pops open, and between five to thirty warheads then launch from their own missile pods, their own propulsion systems, and hone in on different military and civilian and industrial targets.
[00:14:03.246 --> 00:14:06.049]  Now, the latest MIRV technology, again, that the U.S.
[00:14:06.069 --> 00:14:09.312]  has and the Russians have, the Topal M, can have about 30 of these.
[00:14:09.572 --> 00:14:13.816]  And warheads aren't cheap, so normally about half of them are real warheads.
[00:14:14.216 --> 00:14:15.698]  The others are dummies.
[00:14:16.582 --> 00:14:34.976]  And so then the former DC-10s retrofitted with giant chemical lasers that are always in the air flying around, and the particle beams based in space since the 80s, and the particle beams on the ground are unable to shoot all of them down.
[00:14:37.018 --> 00:14:39.280]  So we get hit.
[00:14:40.487 --> 00:14:59.888]  And so while the government's running around telling you Al-Qaeda's going to nuke you any minute, give up all your liberties, Bill Clinton gave the latest supercomputers, but there were still some restrictions, to the Chi-Coms, that's communist Chinese for those that have been told they're not communist anymore.
[00:15:01.423 --> 00:15:03.705]  And Bill Clinton was in deep trouble of it.
[00:15:03.865 --> 00:15:04.525]  I ranted.
[00:15:04.686 --> 00:15:05.406]  I raved.
[00:15:05.566 --> 00:15:07.248]  I screamed from the rooftops.
[00:15:07.288 --> 00:15:11.651]  I remember, you know, back then it was every month the Communist Chinese were threatening to nuke us.
[00:15:11.711 --> 00:15:15.093]  And, you know, you go ahead and hit Beijing, we'll hit New York.
[00:15:16.114 --> 00:15:16.755]  We'll hit L.A.
[00:15:18.456 --> 00:15:42.960]  And then George Bush got into office, and he took all restrictions off, and every supercomputer you can imagine for building cruise missiles, building MIRV technology, building microchips, really sold us out industrially, because these are needed to design chips, not just for warfare, was given to them, and there was not a word said by Bill Gertz.
[00:15:43.655 --> 00:15:48.119]  There was not a word said by Rush Limbaugh.
[00:15:48.559 --> 00:15:51.042]  There was not a peep out of Michael Weiner.
[00:15:51.482 --> 00:15:55.606]  There was not a scintilla said by Michael Gallagher.
[00:15:56.486 --> 00:15:57.827]  Nothing was said.
[00:15:58.768 --> 00:16:06.695]  It was in the military publications, it was in a few truly conservative and libertarian publications, and a few liberal publications.
[00:16:06.775 --> 00:16:07.576]  And you can look it up.
[00:16:08.657 --> 00:16:09.678]  And so, again...
[00:16:10.786 --> 00:16:12.407]  Bush wants the assault weapons ban.
[00:16:12.447 --> 00:16:14.668]  Bush appoints pro-abortionists.
[00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:16.329]  Bush signs back on to UNESCO.
[00:16:16.649 --> 00:16:18.950]  Bush is for total amnesty for the illegal aliens.
[00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.671]  Bush gives us a $2.6 trillion budget.
[00:16:21.971 --> 00:16:24.072]  Bill Clinton's biggest was $1.8 trillion.
[00:16:26.954 --> 00:16:29.014]  And that's okay, though.
[00:16:30.175 --> 00:16:35.077]  Because the average so-called conservative, with a military background who makes $200,000 a year...
[00:16:37.532 --> 00:16:38.554]  We'll argue with you.
[00:16:38.615 --> 00:16:43.105]  They're smart guys and gals, but they decide to not face the truth.
[00:16:43.729 --> 00:16:49.292]  And they will tell you, they've told me in grocery stores and at neighborhood swimming pools, that no, Alex, it's not true.
[00:16:49.352 --> 00:16:50.833]  Gonzalez is an anti-gun.
[00:16:51.134 --> 00:16:52.214]  He's not pro-abortion.
[00:16:52.574 --> 00:16:56.797]  Or Rush, this is word for word, or Rush Limbaugh would have talked about it.
[00:16:57.197 --> 00:16:58.698]  Well, let me tell you something.
[00:16:59.138 --> 00:17:01.300]  You don't know what's going on.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:03.461]  And you better find out.
[00:17:04.321 --> 00:17:07.423]  In case you don't believe me, let me just read the Financial Times of London.
[00:17:08.944 --> 00:17:10.265]  They were at the press conference yesterday.
[00:17:11.334 --> 00:17:13.715]  Top Chinese general warns U.S.
[00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:14.475]  over an attack.
[00:17:15.675 --> 00:17:18.216]  China is prepared to use nuclear weapons against the U.S.
[00:17:18.536 --> 00:17:26.218]  if it is attacked by Washington during a confrontation over Taiwan, a Chinese general said yesterday in a press conference.
[00:17:27.078 --> 00:17:40.142]  Quote, this is in front of over 100 reporters, if the Americans draw their missiles and position guided ammunition onto the target zone, if they just are deployed,
[00:17:41.053 --> 00:17:52.497]  On Chinese territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons, said General Zhu Qingyu.
[00:17:53.417 --> 00:18:00.119]  General Zhu was speaking at a function for foreign journalists organized in part by the Chinese government, so it's official.
[00:18:00.919 --> 00:18:06.421]  He added that China's definition of its territory included warships and aircraft.
[00:18:07.446 --> 00:18:15.431]  If the Americans are determined to interfere, then we will be determined to respond to General Zhu, who is also a professor at China's National Defense University.
[00:18:15.951 --> 00:18:22.195]  We will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all the cities of Xi'an.
[00:18:22.675 --> 00:18:28.199]  Of course, the Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds of cities will be destroyed by the Chinese.
[00:18:29.059 --> 00:18:32.101]  Thomas Barnett says the Muslims are the threat at the Pentagon.
[00:18:32.541 --> 00:18:33.522]  Their top strategist...
[00:18:36.204 --> 00:18:37.666]  He says the Chinese are good.
[00:18:38.406 --> 00:18:39.227]  Hey, tell you what.
[00:18:39.367 --> 00:18:42.210]  Email, instant message my producer, John.
[00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:44.413]  Get Benton K. Parton on.
[00:18:44.753 --> 00:18:45.974]  I want to get General Parton on.
[00:18:46.435 --> 00:18:47.516]  If not today, Monday.
[00:18:47.536 --> 00:18:49.618]  In fact, I want Parton on right now.
[00:18:49.678 --> 00:18:50.339]  Try to get Parton.
[00:18:50.439 --> 00:18:51.180]  I just thought of this.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.121]  Why did I think of that earlier?
[00:18:53.303 --> 00:18:57.747]  General Zhu is a self-acknowledged hawk who has warned that China would strike the U.S.
[00:18:57.767 --> 00:19:05.733]  with long-range missiles, but his threat to use nuclear weapons in a conflict over Taiwan is the most specific by a senior Chinese official in nearly a decade.
[00:19:06.054 --> 00:19:06.754]  That is not true.
[00:19:07.275 --> 00:19:14.401]  However, some U.S.-based Chinese experts caution that General Zhu probably did not represent the mainstream People's Liberation Army view,
[00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:19.843]  He is running way behind his brief on what China might do in retaliation of the U.S.
[00:19:20.243 --> 00:19:21.204]  if push comes to shove.
[00:19:21.624 --> 00:19:31.169]  General Xu's comments come as the Pentagon prepares to brief Congress next Monday on its annual report on the Chinese military, which is expected to take a harder line than previous years.
[00:19:31.229 --> 00:19:35.330]  They are also likely to fuel the mounting anti-China sentiment on Capitol Hill.
[00:19:37.631 --> 00:19:42.974]  So let's worry about Al-Qaeda, folks, which Tony Blair admitted on MSNBC last night doesn't exist.
[00:19:44.179 --> 00:19:45.600]  Oh, we have the link to it.
[00:19:47.121 --> 00:19:53.884]  It doesn't exist, but give up all your rights, because they might pop off a few plastics.
[00:19:55.025 --> 00:19:57.767]  We'll be... Oh, folks, there's so much more.
[00:19:57.847 --> 00:19:58.247]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.496 --> 00:20:02.196]  We're good to go.

[00:21:01.678 --> 00:21:02.278]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:02.298 --> 00:21:03.279]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:21:03.659 --> 00:21:09.381]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.

[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:06.603]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[00:22:07.984 --> 00:22:12.366]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:12.386 --> 00:22:14.468]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:14.488 --> 00:22:15.148]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:15.188 --> 00:22:17.109]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:17.189 --> 00:22:17.949]  Here is reality.
[00:22:17.969 --> 00:22:19.570]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:37.813 --> 00:22:38.053]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[00:23:01.798 --> 00:23:05.159]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:23:05.419 --> 00:23:05.739]  Why?
[00:23:05.759 --> 00:23:08.700]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[00:23:49.013 --> 00:23:50.814]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[00:24:06.084 --> 00:24:07.986]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.467 --> 00:24:11.310]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:17.218 --> 00:24:24.967]  Alright, understand that strategically, globally, the term communism didn't exist until about 100 years ago.
[00:24:28.607 --> 00:24:30.668]  Before that, it was international socialism.
[00:24:30.808 --> 00:24:34.030]  And it was written up and paid for by the British Crown.
[00:24:34.090 --> 00:24:43.475]  They had people all over the world creating middle classes, even displacing some of the robber barons, some of the industrial barons' monopoly of control.
[00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:45.516]  And it's public.
[00:24:45.616 --> 00:24:49.238]  They funded communism as a false choice.
[00:24:49.379 --> 00:24:51.480]  Oh, let's get those evil rich people.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.083]  Well, really what it was was the elite manipulating the poor populations to go after the middle class.
[00:24:58.251 --> 00:25:10.100]  And so the Soviet Union was literally funded by London and Wall Street, by New York and London, as well as some of the French industrialists and German industrialists trying to fund it.
[00:25:12.282 --> 00:25:25.552]  I'll never forget, and I've told this story many times, they had a special on the History Channel about five years ago, and they had the CIA section chief, who was over China in 1949,
[00:25:28.143 --> 00:25:30.766]  He was an old 80-something-year-old man whenever he gave the interview.
[00:25:31.947 --> 00:25:35.410]  And he said, well, contrary to popular belief, we actually put Mao in.
[00:25:35.450 --> 00:25:37.772]  We didn't like the Nationalists.
[00:25:37.812 --> 00:25:39.494]  We thought Mao would do a better job.
[00:25:41.115 --> 00:25:42.036]  So there again.
[00:25:42.096 --> 00:25:43.417]  Now, we already knew that.
[00:25:44.218 --> 00:25:45.399]  We'd already covered that.
[00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:47.561]  But here they were just admitting it.
[00:25:47.661 --> 00:25:51.085]  It's like Kermit Roosevelt admitting they carried out terror attacks.
[00:25:51.901 --> 00:25:54.444]  In 1953, to blame it on Mosaddegh and Iran.
[00:25:54.504 --> 00:25:57.748]  I mean, I can't get over how they just come out and admit it.
[00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.550]  You understand, folks, this is admitted.
[00:26:00.972 --> 00:26:05.518]  And then Nixon opens up China in the early 1970s.
[00:26:05.718 --> 00:26:10.564]  Bush is, of course, the ambassador there, lived there for three years.
[00:26:11.685 --> 00:26:20.488]  Kissinger was the main envoy on that, and then suddenly all of our factories started shifting over to China, moving over to China with the slave labor.
[00:26:20.708 --> 00:26:31.791]  Then the globalists, based in Europe and the U.S., for now 25, 30 years, have used those slave goods to leverage out our factories, our companies, because it's not free market.
[00:26:31.891 --> 00:26:33.051]  We cannot compete.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:36.522]  With a billion, 300 million slaves.
[00:26:37.002 --> 00:26:55.275]  And so only certain major conglomerates like Costco and Walmart, who are basically controlled by the same globalists, are able to then get these baubles and goods, retail goods, these incredibly low prices, and then they're able to literally knock out all their competition.
[00:26:56.545 --> 00:26:58.266]  Further centralizing control.
[00:26:58.326 --> 00:27:01.127]  So they made this deal with the devil with Mao.
[00:27:01.187 --> 00:27:16.571]  Remember in 2000, they celebrated, excuse me, 1999, 50 years of Mao, and the Fortune 500 had their annual meeting, the Fortune 500 celebration in Tiananmen Square with a military parade.
[00:27:17.232 --> 00:27:19.332]  Journalists out there, check your LexisNexis.
[00:27:19.632 --> 00:27:21.233]  You can pull this up on Google as well.
[00:27:21.966 --> 00:27:35.635]  I'll never forget seeing it on the news as they were there, and Jiang Zemin said, Chinese capitalism is the greatest, this is a quote, is the greatest expression of communism.
[00:27:37.196 --> 00:27:44.141]  Chinese capitalism is the greatest expression and form of communism.
[00:27:44.681 --> 00:27:45.582]  That's the exact quote.
[00:27:46.982 --> 00:27:50.605]  And people go, capitalism is communism?
[00:27:51.334 --> 00:27:52.634]  But what is capitalism?
[00:27:52.694 --> 00:27:56.155]  We were told we're not free market, we're not liberty-oriented anymore.
[00:27:56.895 --> 00:27:58.476]  We're now capitalist.
[00:27:58.516 --> 00:27:59.816]  Well, what is capitalist?
[00:27:59.936 --> 00:28:04.557]  Centralized elites know best, and they have the capital, and it's capitalism.
[00:28:04.817 --> 00:28:10.818]  But they get that capital through criminal means, whether it's through socialism or communism or fascism.
[00:28:11.138 --> 00:28:18.660]  And Carol Quigley said in his 1968 book, Tragedy and Hope, Bill Clinton's mentor, who he thanked,
[00:28:19.794 --> 00:28:40.140]  In his acceptance speech, when he had been sworn in, who he thanked in his first State of the Union, that Georgetown head of the political science department wrote a 900-page book saying, we are the globalists, we control fascism, we control communism.
[00:28:41.781 --> 00:28:44.962]  We are the new world order.
[00:28:45.931 --> 00:28:54.653]  And so now you've got to ask yourselves, why did Rumsfeld through Clinton give the reactors in North Korea so they can produce over 100 nuclear weapons with what we gave them?
[00:28:55.314 --> 00:28:57.974]  Why did they give China the MIRV technology?
[00:28:58.795 --> 00:29:00.715]  Why did they let them take Hong Kong?
[00:29:01.195 --> 00:29:01.735]  Why?
[00:29:02.216 --> 00:29:02.756]  Why?
[00:29:03.116 --> 00:29:03.516]  Why?
[00:29:03.636 --> 00:29:07.637]  That's the $64 million question.
[00:29:08.357 --> 00:29:11.658]  And I'll give you the answer briefly on the other side.
[00:29:12.598 --> 00:29:14.519]  It is so important.
[00:29:15.430 --> 00:29:17.852]  And then we'll get into the latest developments with the terror attacks.
[00:29:18.232 --> 00:29:19.233]  Take a bunch of your calls.
[00:29:19.273 --> 00:29:20.514]  We've got a guest coming on.
[00:29:20.894 --> 00:29:22.755]  Talk about the land grabbing that's going on.
[00:29:23.136 --> 00:29:27.939]  But until we get real political terms, we're not going to get this country back.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:38.787]  Until we're able to really understand the true political paradigm, things are only going to get worse.
[00:29:41.172 --> 00:29:42.133]  It's about life and death.
[00:29:42.173 --> 00:29:43.815]  I mean, all of our lives are on the line.
[00:29:43.936 --> 00:29:45.217]  All of our freedoms are on the line.
[00:29:45.618 --> 00:29:47.300]  Our children's future are on the line.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.482]  We better figure out what's really going on.
[00:29:49.803 --> 00:29:50.604]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.845 --> 00:29:52.787]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.247 --> 00:29:54.849]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.869 --> 00:29:58.454]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.753 --> 00:30:04.115]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:08.219]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:30:08.539 --> 00:30:09.340]  Read the labels.
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:13.884]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:14.124 --> 00:30:18.307]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:30:18.688 --> 00:30:23.572]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:30:23.932 --> 00:30:27.514]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:30:27.714 --> 00:30:33.056]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[00:31:01.135 --> 00:31:03.096]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.176 --> 00:31:13.902]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.263 --> 00:31:18.805]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.865 --> 00:31:30.192]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.792 --> 00:31:37.641]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.041 --> 00:31:40.184]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:40.665 --> 00:31:45.631]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[00:31:56.718 --> 00:31:57.479]  That's toll free.
[00:31:57.499 --> 00:31:57.539]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.864 --> 00:32:03.304]  We're good to go.
[00:32:27.551 --> 00:32:27.911]  We're good to go.
[00:32:47.486 --> 00:32:51.529]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:32:51.749 --> 00:32:54.972]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.915 --> 00:33:26.122]  I want to repeat, ladies and gentlemen, according to MSNBC, he is either the number three or the number two general.
[00:33:26.862 --> 00:33:28.944]  He's basically on the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[00:33:30.645 --> 00:33:33.547]  And in the past, he's been the number one Chinese general.
[00:33:33.587 --> 00:33:34.988]  He threatened to destroy 200 U.S.
[00:33:36.289 --> 00:33:38.731]  cities yesterday in a press conference.
[00:33:39.713 --> 00:33:40.093]  We're good to go.
[00:34:05.842 --> 00:34:06.642]  It's just incredible.
[00:34:06.963 --> 00:34:17.428]  It's just incredible that we're stomping around in Iraq because of the quote of Saddam Hussein, who was in our lap in the 1980s, and then meanwhile China's threatening to nuke us.
[00:34:17.468 --> 00:34:18.408]  This is insane.
[00:34:19.389 --> 00:34:20.449]  Insane!
[00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:24.711]  Can you imagine if Saddam would have threatened to nuke 200 cities?
[00:34:25.772 --> 00:34:26.052]  No!
[00:34:26.132 --> 00:34:28.213]  The guy didn't even have Tinker Toys, folks!
[00:34:29.870 --> 00:34:33.011]  All right, I'm really upset about the China situation.
[00:34:33.431 --> 00:34:34.471]  Threatening the nuke us.
[00:34:34.752 --> 00:34:35.192]  Threatening.
[00:34:35.392 --> 00:34:39.433]  And believe me, I'm in central Texas with more military bases than any other area of the U.S.
[00:34:40.153 --> 00:34:41.454]  Okay, Fort Hood, you name it.
[00:34:43.194 --> 00:34:44.394]  They're serious, folks.
[00:34:45.935 --> 00:34:47.655]  They're saying they'll kill us.
[00:34:48.076 --> 00:34:49.456]  I don't appreciate that.
[00:34:49.476 --> 00:34:50.516]  All right, I'm sorry.
[00:34:50.616 --> 00:34:51.757]  I'm just really mad about this.
[00:34:51.957 --> 00:34:52.837]  And we should be mad.
[00:34:54.217 --> 00:34:59.459]  The gentleman we have on with us is, of course, a Marine Corps colonel in his own right, Frank J. Cort.
[00:35:00.336 --> 00:35:12.244]  State representative fighting in the Texas House of Representatives to get an amendment so that the Supreme Court ruling won't be able to allow private companies to go lobby the government to steal property, basically.
[00:35:12.664 --> 00:35:22.551]  We've already covered the Freeport situation where the heir to ExxonMobil or Mobile wants somebody else's property.
[00:35:23.231 --> 00:35:26.754]  And this is a big company, Western Seafood.
[00:35:27.738 --> 00:35:30.039]  They've got a $40 million a year business.
[00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:31.440]  I mean, even they're not safe.
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:34.642]  So don't think for a minute you're safe if you're blue-collar or white-collar.
[00:35:35.902 --> 00:35:36.423]  State Rep.
[00:35:36.503 --> 00:35:37.903]  Court, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:35:38.604 --> 00:35:39.244]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:35:39.404 --> 00:35:40.265]  Good to be with you again.
[00:35:40.465 --> 00:35:46.628]  Hey, what do you think about the number two, number three man in the communist military and China saying they'll destroy 200 U.S.
[00:35:46.648 --> 00:35:46.828]  cities?
[00:35:48.931 --> 00:35:57.857]  Well, I tell you, they honestly have the capability, and putting those with the words or something to take serious, that's no doubt about that.
[00:35:59.058 --> 00:36:00.539]  Oh, but we're worried about Saddam.
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:14.909]  Well, you know, there's all kinds of threats out there, and I think that we... I don't know if it's necessarily not taking it serious, but I think that they definitely need to be listening to it and seeing what that means.
[00:36:16.187 --> 00:36:21.810]  Well, I mean, the Soviets, I think, only once threatened Anoukas, and that was in veiled threats.
[00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.271]  I mean, what's going on with these chi-coms?
[00:36:25.251 --> 00:36:33.515]  Well, you know, there's a... You know, and I'm not necessarily an Asian specialist, but I will tell you that the Asian countries have a lot of capabilities.
[00:36:33.876 --> 00:36:44.661]  And I don't know if it's not necessarily that we're focusing too much on one area, but I do know that traditionally the military is always worried about those capabilities in Asian areas, and especially Chinese.
[00:36:46.018 --> 00:36:47.019]  As well as the North Koreans.
[00:36:47.259 --> 00:36:53.103]  Well, you know, right here in Central and South Texas, we're the number two target after D.C.?
[00:36:54.665 --> 00:36:55.005]  Oh, yeah.
[00:36:55.065 --> 00:36:57.967]  Well, we've got one-tenth of the military station here in Texas.
[00:36:58.387 --> 00:37:01.129]  We would definitely be a vulnerability and a target.
[00:37:02.790 --> 00:37:05.812]  Yeah, I mean, how many bases are there in Central and South Texas?
[00:37:06.233 --> 00:37:13.378]  Well, we have 18 military installations in Texas, Fort Hood being one of the biggest, along with El Paso, which is Fort Bliss.
[00:37:13.959 --> 00:37:19.522]  And then we have our air intelligence agencies right here in San Antonio, where I live.
[00:37:20.023 --> 00:37:22.784]  So we've got a lot of important commands.
[00:37:22.864 --> 00:37:24.285]  All of them are important, I guess.
[00:37:24.806 --> 00:37:29.789]  But they definitely would be things that would be looked at as being targets.
[00:37:30.069 --> 00:37:33.531]  Well, I don't appreciate the communist Chinese threatening to kill my family.
[00:37:33.971 --> 00:37:34.451]  I don't either.
[00:37:34.471 --> 00:37:38.034]  I think that there's some real problems with that.
[00:37:38.434 --> 00:37:41.796]  I'm sure all the experts are working on it.
[00:37:42.036 --> 00:37:42.937]  I know you...
[00:37:44.057 --> 00:37:51.138]  I know, Representative Cort, you came on to talk about this, but since you're a colonel in the Marine Corps, I thought we'd also get into that.
[00:37:52.659 --> 00:37:53.959]  Mr. Cort, I know you're on a cell phone.
[00:37:53.979 --> 00:37:54.659]  A lot's going on.
[00:37:54.699 --> 00:37:57.359]  Tell us what's going on with your amendment right now to H.J.
[00:37:57.419 --> 00:37:57.640]  Res.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:37:57.640]  19.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:05.321]  Well, I tell you, you know, three weeks ago we talked about this measure, and of course we filed it right after we got to this special session.
[00:38:05.341 --> 00:38:11.322]  You know, the decision that was just a ridiculous, ludicrous decision of Kelo v. New London, Connecticut.
[00:38:11.704 --> 00:38:23.282]  Well, the Supreme Court said that, you know, their domain was abilities of cities, and not only can they do it, they can also take it for economic development, and also to give it to a third party is just horrendous.
[00:38:23.912 --> 00:38:31.539]  And so as you and I talked last time, we were taking action by putting a constitutional provision that will protect people's private property.
[00:38:31.579 --> 00:38:42.368]  And the report to you is that we passed that measure on Tuesday of this week with 132 of 4 and 0 against in a Texas house.
[00:38:42.969 --> 00:38:49.435]  And I think that's just really phenomenal to have an issue like this passed with such support.
[00:38:49.935 --> 00:38:50.816]  How many senators are there?
[00:38:50.836 --> 00:38:53.278]  Yeah, I knew it was around 30, so what's the problem?
[00:39:13.374 --> 00:39:27.790]  Well, believe it or not, I guess they woke up and some folks that are opposed to this, like the municipalities and others, have come to those folks and convinced them that this isn't such a good idea because we don't want to... This is in their words.
[00:39:28.091 --> 00:39:29.092]  They say that they don't want to...
[00:39:31.394 --> 00:39:37.896]  Make a mistake that would cause us to have an opportunity that might be good for our communities, whatever that means.
[00:39:37.956 --> 00:39:42.398]  So basically the greedy cities and counties are lobbying to be able to steal property.
[00:39:42.658 --> 00:39:43.698]  Well, I'm going to be honest.
[00:39:43.738 --> 00:39:44.938]  I'm kind of a factual guy.
[00:39:44.998 --> 00:39:47.279]  I can't say that they're actually doing that, but someone's doing it.
[00:39:47.619 --> 00:39:53.421]  And I will tell you that what's happening is that at the same time, we're running out of time.
[00:39:54.293 --> 00:40:00.036]  We were in this special session for 30 days, and of course we were called originally to address school finance.
[00:40:00.637 --> 00:40:12.963]  The governor, obviously hearing the calls of the people, called to his office and added this to the special session call as of Friday, and quickly we moved it to the House floor.
[00:40:13.163 --> 00:40:15.845]  As I said earlier, we had 132, had 150.
[00:40:16.125 --> 00:40:21.148]  The other members were either absent, excused absence, or they just were in their office.
[00:40:21.168 --> 00:40:23.589]  I don't know what, I can't explain what they were doing, but I can tell you,
[00:40:23.949 --> 00:40:28.153]  Being in the legislature now for 13 years, that's a pretty good vote.
[00:40:28.453 --> 00:40:29.274]  132 to nothing.
[00:40:29.414 --> 00:40:36.041]  Who do we need to lobby to get the Senate to concur?
[00:40:36.381 --> 00:40:39.424]  Well, there's several folks.
[00:40:39.464 --> 00:40:44.589]  Lieutenant Governor and, of course, their office has been very amenable to say that they're ready to take it up when it gets there.
[00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:49.432]  But every presiding officer in any chamber is very influential.
[00:40:49.472 --> 00:40:52.153]  Who are some of the ringleaders in the Senate that are blocking this?
[00:40:52.634 --> 00:40:56.056]  Well, Senator John Whitmire was definitely opposed to it.
[00:40:56.076 --> 00:41:01.919]  He actually debated against the enabling legislation that was similar, but it's not the constitutional provisions.
[00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:04.641]  We need a constitutional provision, and let me tell you why.
[00:41:05.154 --> 00:41:13.156]  You know, it's easy to have a law that can be either challenged or overturned or even changed in the legislature by a simple majority.
[00:41:13.816 --> 00:41:20.238]  The Constitution of our nation, as you know, and the Constitution of our state was created to protect the citizens against government.
[00:41:21.118 --> 00:41:25.759]  Our founding fathers fought against a king that was taking away their privileges and their rights and their
[00:41:26.232 --> 00:41:26.753]  We're good to go.
[00:41:48.793 --> 00:41:49.734]  You know, in their decision.
[00:41:49.774 --> 00:41:58.163]  So, enabling legislation is fine, but it's not going to be as a meaningful protection as this constitutional provision.
[00:41:58.243 --> 00:42:01.085]  Okay, so you said Senator Whitmire, who else?
[00:42:01.125 --> 00:42:02.607]  Whitmire, yeah.
[00:42:03.027 --> 00:42:05.129]  There was Senator Shapley from El Paso.
[00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.692]  You know, what we really need to do is convince the chairman...
[00:42:08.472 --> 00:42:11.373]  Okay, so we need to call the Senator from Lubbock.
[00:42:26.078 --> 00:42:26.959]  Yeah.
[00:42:27.079 --> 00:42:35.125]  And, of course, my Senate sponsor is very capable because he passed the Naval legislation on Wednesday in the Senate.
[00:42:35.825 --> 00:42:36.766]  But it wasn't easy.
[00:42:36.806 --> 00:42:39.828]  It was a five-hour debate where we didn't have that much debate.
[00:42:40.089 --> 00:42:43.151]  We had a few folks that wanted to amend it, but they were friendly amendments.
[00:42:43.927 --> 00:42:50.991]  And I say that to strengthen it and it wasn't to weaken it as they had in the Senate on the enabling legislation.
[00:42:51.331 --> 00:43:00.676]  So we need to get this measure up in the Senate and we need to get it voted on so we can give this protection of private property before we adjourn on Wednesday of next week.
[00:43:01.494 --> 00:43:05.237]  All right, so now is the time for folks to start calling.
[00:43:06.177 --> 00:43:09.580]  Do you, I mean, I've got a bunch of different phone numbers here.
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:15.264]  I don't want to swamp your office, but if folks call your office, can they then get them?
[00:43:15.304 --> 00:43:18.706]  I think it would be best for, you know, only because if they want to talk to particular people.
[00:43:19.106 --> 00:43:20.587]  I'm going to tell you the truth, Alex.
[00:43:20.827 --> 00:43:28.813]  I think it's the best to talk to our allies, and I think that would be, obviously, Senator Duncan is an ally for us right now because he can make this happen.
[00:43:29.572 --> 00:43:36.336]  You know, Whitmire, you know, calling him, that's fine if people want to do that, but, you know, we don't want to get him riled up either, you know, because we want this thing to pass.
[00:43:36.776 --> 00:43:40.158]  So, you know, everybody can do what they feel the best, but call my office.
[00:43:40.719 --> 00:43:43.781]  I have a toll-free number in Texas across the nation.
[00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:44.061]  It's 888-463-0646.
[00:43:44.081 --> 00:43:45.502]  I'm going to do that again.
[00:43:45.522 --> 00:43:45.562]  888-463-0646.
[00:43:55.821 --> 00:43:59.120]  All right, and this is so important because...
[00:44:00.487 --> 00:44:07.631]  Texas is being looked at just like Connecticut is a battleground state for this and so many other issues of freedom and liberty.
[00:44:07.972 --> 00:44:09.533]  And I can tell you, State Rep.
[00:44:09.593 --> 00:44:14.436]  Frank J. Court, it is refreshing to have your office contact my office this morning.
[00:44:15.176 --> 00:44:26.083]  Ron Paul is the only national congressman that routinely contacts our show to help us lobby for issues of liberty, and it's very refreshing to have a State Rep's
[00:44:26.643 --> 00:44:28.064]  Office, contact us.
[00:44:28.124 --> 00:44:32.586]  We're more than willing to help because you're trying to help us and help all Texans and all Americans.
[00:44:32.986 --> 00:44:38.588]  So give Representative Court's office a call, folks, 888-463-0646.
[00:44:39.469 --> 00:44:46.212]  And I don't care if you live in Maine or Los Angeles, California, and you're listening right now, this affects you in a big way.
[00:44:46.292 --> 00:44:51.794]  So call and get those specific numbers so we can lobby and have our First Amendment heard.
[00:44:52.395 --> 00:44:55.156]  And anything else, Representative Court?
[00:44:55.576 --> 00:45:06.562]  No, I just thank you for giving me the opportunity to give you an update, and we hope to report to you next week that this thing has been passed and there's a protection for private property in Texas.
[00:45:06.882 --> 00:45:09.163]  All right, yeah, pop some champagne if that happens.
[00:45:09.203 --> 00:45:10.404]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:45:10.464 --> 00:45:10.844]  Take care.
[00:45:11.244 --> 00:45:11.865]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:45:12.565 --> 00:45:13.045]  All right.
[00:45:13.605 --> 00:45:16.407]  Now, listen, I do get hot about this communist Chinese thing.
[00:45:17.529 --> 00:45:32.840]  And before Representative Court joined us, I was getting into how one of the top communist Chinese generals, and depending on what communist Chinese publication you read, he's number three or number two.
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.101]  He's been the number one man in their military.
[00:45:35.642 --> 00:45:39.244]  And they had an officially government-sanctioned press conference.
[00:45:39.264 --> 00:45:40.525]  They call it a press conference.
[00:45:41.766 --> 00:45:44.888]  So you better believe this is the official view of the Chai Coms.
[00:45:46.678 --> 00:45:49.680]  To tell us that we'll destroy 200 of your cities.
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:46:02.847]  If you even target, if you even point missiles at one of our ships or at one of our military assets, that we're going to go after you.
[00:46:03.948 --> 00:46:09.351]  And our government has been selling the Communist Chinese the latest weapon systems, the latest supercomputers,
[00:46:10.197 --> 00:46:18.423]  So they can pack their Long March missiles, again, full of dozens and dozens of warheads and dummy warheads to fool our anti-missile systems.
[00:46:19.964 --> 00:46:23.227]  The most effective of those systems are the DC-10s flying around.
[00:46:23.647 --> 00:46:25.849]  What is there, eight of them at any one time over the U.S.?
[00:46:26.289 --> 00:46:37.397]  A couple are in Europe with these giant chemical lasers that fly around at 50,000 feet and try to zap these missiles as they come in before they detonate.
[00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:50.129]  But there's no way for ten of these aircraft, I guess eight of them up in the air any one day, to be able to defend against all of this, and I don't think the globalists would defend against it.
[00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:51.731]  Why do I say that?
[00:46:52.391 --> 00:47:02.918]  The first thing Bill Clinton did, right before he left office, a whole string of traitorous things he did, was sign Presidential Decision Directive 60.
[00:47:05.174 --> 00:47:05.734]  PDD 60.
[00:47:06.715 --> 00:47:17.000]  And most of 60 is secret, but what is not secret openly states that we no longer are under MAD, or Mutually Assured Destruction.
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:33.608]  What that means, if they're tracking 300 missiles, 20 missiles, in space, coming in to hit the continental United States or our possessions, that there will be a total release from the nuclear subs, the aircraft carriers, the fighter bombers, the bombers,
[00:47:34.471 --> 00:47:43.914]  The missile silos, the MX missiles, you name it, that we will absorb a strike and then decide what to do.
[00:47:44.835 --> 00:47:45.955]  That's unbelievable.
[00:47:46.275 --> 00:47:49.336]  By the way, the Russians and the Chinese are still on MAD.
[00:47:49.977 --> 00:47:54.018]  They're ready to launch, and they've developed new missiles and deployed them.
[00:47:56.957 --> 00:47:58.277]  And remember, it is our government.
[00:47:58.317 --> 00:48:04.379]  It was the Nixon administration with Ambassador Bush that opened China up and transferred our jobs and factories over there.
[00:48:04.819 --> 00:48:10.320]  They used that with select global corporations to leverage out our economy and de-industrialize us here.
[00:48:12.061 --> 00:48:13.341]  They put Mao into power in 1949.
[00:48:13.581 --> 00:48:15.141]  This is publicly admitted.
[00:48:16.542 --> 00:48:16.842]  Why?
[00:48:17.702 --> 00:48:19.202]  Why did they put the Soviets into power?
[00:48:20.883 --> 00:48:23.964]  Because the globalists needed a phony, bipolar world.
[00:48:24.044 --> 00:48:25.804]  We've actually had a global government
[00:48:27.795 --> 00:48:28.676]  Since 1945.
[00:48:29.856 --> 00:48:31.477]  And even before that, they were setting it up.
[00:48:32.558 --> 00:48:45.024]  There were a lot of countries that weren't under the control of the global government, but predominantly most of the world was under its control via the World Bank and the IMF and through the United Nations and other organizations.
[00:48:45.484 --> 00:48:53.688]  And we're under UN regulations here in America with Agenda 21 and all of the World Trade Organization and the rest of it.
[00:48:53.708 --> 00:48:54.729]  And understand...
[00:48:56.042 --> 00:48:59.524]  Our government was allies with the Chinese during the war against the Japanese.
[00:48:59.564 --> 00:49:00.744]  They've always been allies.
[00:49:00.764 --> 00:49:02.065]  This whole thing is staged.
[00:49:03.745 --> 00:49:10.348]  And I have no doubt that our government would not even engage in a limited exchange with the Chinese to bring in world government.
[00:49:10.488 --> 00:49:12.950]  A limited, staged exchange.
[00:49:13.670 --> 00:49:14.750]  They're that ruthless.
[00:49:15.251 --> 00:49:16.151]  They're that cunning.
[00:49:19.165 --> 00:49:21.467]  And all the indicators show this.
[00:49:21.587 --> 00:49:22.868]  It shows that it's in the cards.
[00:49:23.048 --> 00:49:26.590]  I'm not saying it's going to happen, but this is what everything is indicating.
[00:49:28.772 --> 00:49:41.621]  The way things are shaking out, it looks like in the next eight years or so, less than ten now, that they will have some type of nuclear event with South Korea, claim North Korea did it, probably won't even be North Korea, move against North Korea.
[00:49:41.741 --> 00:49:46.424]  Our government will sit it out, let the communist Chinese take Taiwan...
[00:49:47.865 --> 00:49:53.067]  And before that, there'll be a biological event.
[00:49:53.147 --> 00:49:55.588]  It'll probably actually be chemical, but it'll be called biological.
[00:49:56.128 --> 00:49:57.808]  Or a dirty bomb for sure.
[00:49:57.888 --> 00:49:59.169]  I'm sorry, but that's in the cards.
[00:49:59.229 --> 00:49:59.689]  Guaranteed.
[00:50:00.269 --> 00:50:03.770]  Perhaps even a thermal nuclear detonation or an atomic detonation.
[00:50:04.351 --> 00:50:05.651]  That'll be blamed on the Middle East.
[00:50:05.791 --> 00:50:07.372]  Our government will attack North Korea.
[00:50:07.832 --> 00:50:09.332]  They will attack the Middle East.
[00:50:09.672 --> 00:50:11.353]  Paul Harvey will get the nuking he wants.
[00:50:12.365 --> 00:50:13.226]  He's been calling for.
[00:50:13.246 --> 00:50:30.957]  There'll be a total police state here, total national draft, and it'll be just like World War II, but they will allow the Chinese and the Russians to grab new areas, and our government will grab the other areas, and you'll have the first real total world government dominating every country on the face of the globe.
[00:50:32.578 --> 00:50:33.979]  Now, that's what we're facing.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:40.343]  And I understand the geopolitical landscape.
[00:50:40.944 --> 00:50:41.504]  I have spent...
[00:50:42.964 --> 00:50:55.494]  Last night I sat in a chair for four hours focusing deeply on this, thinking about it, drawing notes, researching, and it's the same conclusion I had five years ago.
[00:50:56.395 --> 00:50:57.495]  All right, that's the analysis.
[00:50:57.515 --> 00:50:58.957]  You want to know what's going on, that's it.
[00:50:58.977 --> 00:50:59.377]  Stay with us.
[00:51:03.129 --> 00:51:03.569]  We're good to go.
[00:51:23.103 --> 00:51:27.086]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:27.106 --> 00:51:29.268]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:02.262 --> 00:52:06.166]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:06.386 --> 00:52:11.831]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:12.111 --> 00:52:22.481]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:22.641 --> 00:52:27.005]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:27.165 --> 00:52:35.510]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:35.791 --> 00:52:42.175]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:42.275 --> 00:52:46.758]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave them the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:46.978 --> 00:52:51.181]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[00:53:02.509 --> 00:53:05.551]  Gano Cafe is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[00:53:05.791 --> 00:53:11.435]  Already a number one beverage in Asia, Gano Cafe is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[00:53:11.736 --> 00:53:17.600]  What makes Gano Cafe special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:23.725]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginsengs.
[00:53:23.865 --> 00:53:24.686]  We're good to go.
[00:54:15.652 --> 00:54:19.914]  Folks, I'm not the one saying we're going to have nukes go off.
[00:54:20.654 --> 00:54:27.217]  I'm not the one threatening to nuke us and kill 100 million people, you know, 200 cities.
[00:54:28.698 --> 00:54:33.620]  I'm not the one saying Al-Qaeda is going to attack us any minute, give up all your liberties, while the border stays wide open.
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:34.461]  The government is.
[00:54:35.261 --> 00:54:43.925]  It's not the patriots that are giving all the latest supercomputers and missile secrets to the communist Chinese, to their warheads, so their missiles can have 20 warheads instead of one.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.680]  It's the globalists!
[00:54:46.700 --> 00:54:50.762]  You know, everybody blames Bill Clinton for giving supercomputers to China.
[00:54:50.782 --> 00:54:52.262]  It was Republican companies doing it.
[00:54:52.602 --> 00:54:57.144]  It was Rumsfeld getting Clinton to authorize giving the systems to North Korea.
[00:54:57.804 --> 00:54:59.604]  We're supposed to deny all this?
[00:55:01.405 --> 00:55:13.949]  Before I go to David and Kevin and Mike and Deagle and Robert and everybody else, and Ron, you know, I don't know what I've got to do.
[00:55:15.243 --> 00:55:17.004]  I understand how the globalists operate.
[00:55:17.084 --> 00:55:17.985]  It's just history.
[00:55:18.025 --> 00:55:20.707]  I mean, you read Machiavelli's The Prince written 500 years ago.
[00:55:20.747 --> 00:55:28.773]  It lays it out how governments do this, how they create crises, how they control populations, how they're ruthless, how they think you're gullible, how they manipulate you.
[00:55:29.553 --> 00:55:31.294]  We've got the videos that expose it.
[00:55:33.356 --> 00:55:34.657]  We understand their agenda.
[00:55:35.097 --> 00:55:37.939]  Listen, before I go to your calls, and there's just so much that is coming up today.
[00:55:37.999 --> 00:55:38.860]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.922]  Every day, it just gets more and more out of control.
[00:55:43.777 --> 00:55:45.537]  Folks, you need to get Martial Law.
[00:55:45.577 --> 00:55:46.778]  You need to get Road to Tyranny.
[00:55:46.798 --> 00:55:50.799]  You need to get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, Masters of Terror, Matrix of Evil.
[00:55:50.839 --> 00:55:53.999]  You need to get the other books and videos I carry by wonderful researchers.
[00:55:54.019 --> 00:55:58.280]  I mean, Martial Law exposes who's behind the terror.
[00:55:58.360 --> 00:55:59.781]  It exposes the police state.
[00:55:59.801 --> 00:56:02.001]  It exposes the mindset of the globalists.
[00:56:02.221 --> 00:56:03.002]  It's my best film.
[00:56:03.042 --> 00:56:03.802]  You need to have it.
[00:56:05.362 --> 00:56:07.943]  If you've already gotten the film, make copies of it.
[00:56:08.003 --> 00:56:09.123]  Get it out to people.
[00:56:11.471 --> 00:56:14.773]  They're dismantling all of our freedoms and arming our enemies!
[00:56:16.294 --> 00:56:18.095]  Because it's order out of chaos!
[00:56:18.255 --> 00:56:19.196]  Order out of KO!
[00:56:21.297 --> 00:56:30.282]  Go to InfoWars.com, peruse the safe, secure shopping cart, watch clips of the films, look at all the different discounts, as much as 75% off my videos when you get multiple copies.
[00:56:31.743 --> 00:56:37.687]  And yes, we need your support as well to continue with our webmasters and our bandwidth and shortwave and what we do here.
[00:56:39.726 --> 00:56:43.087]  This is about survival, folks, and we need to stand up and get involved.
[00:56:43.107 --> 00:56:44.568]  So get Martial Law.
[00:56:44.608 --> 00:56:45.528]  Get the other films.
[00:56:45.588 --> 00:56:46.108]  Don't wait.
[00:56:46.408 --> 00:56:47.409]  Call toll-free to get it.
[00:56:47.629 --> 00:56:49.089]  They'll answer all your questions when you call.
[00:56:49.409 --> 00:56:50.350]  No obligation to buy.
[00:56:50.390 --> 00:56:51.810]  You can call and ask questions about the films.
[00:56:51.830 --> 00:56:52.511]  Just please get them.
[00:56:52.531 --> 00:56:53.331]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:56:53.371 --> 00:56:53.611]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:13.792]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv, 15-cent-a-day memberships, monthly and yearly subscriptions, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV report, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:57:14.193 --> 00:57:15.153]  Do not wait, folks.
[00:57:15.213 --> 00:57:17.233]  Take action now and spread the word.
[00:57:17.253 --> 00:57:18.614]  Let's just go to Dr. Deagle first.
[00:57:18.654 --> 00:57:20.174]  He hadn't called in a while.
[00:57:20.214 --> 00:57:21.254]  Dr. Deagle from Canada.
[00:57:21.274 --> 00:57:22.055]  I've been a guest before.
[00:57:22.095 --> 00:57:22.675]  What's going on?
[00:57:23.215 --> 00:57:26.776]  Well, I've got some important information that's going to back you up completely.
[00:57:27.296 --> 00:57:31.397]  You're always right on, Alex, and you're always way ahead of the curve of anyone else, but...
[00:57:32.561 --> 00:57:34.842]  I'm extremely upset about what's going on.
[00:57:36.062 --> 00:57:43.145]  Back on March 19, 1995, I had Colonel Lin Wills over for dinner in Colorado Springs.
[00:57:44.465 --> 00:58:00.231]  And after he said grace at our dinner table, he explained that the previous week, and we're both believers of course, they went to the highest level of DEFCON because a communist Chinese fired missile aimed directly at St.
[00:58:00.271 --> 00:58:00.551]  Louis.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:10.828]  And we didn't know, because they didn't notify us, and didn't notify NORAD, until the President had called them, and we were ready within less than 90 seconds to go to launch on command sequence.
[00:58:10.988 --> 00:58:12.109]  Was it a test missile?
[00:58:12.569 --> 00:58:13.670]  No, it was a test missile.
[00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.831]  We didn't know until after.
[00:58:15.351 --> 00:58:17.473]  They exploded at about 120 miles over St.
[00:58:17.513 --> 00:58:17.833]  Louis.
[00:58:19.194 --> 00:58:21.496]  That's only one of the many issues that's going on.
[00:58:22.117 --> 00:58:25.920]  I also was a doctor taking care of Lockheed Martin, Lucent Technologies, and other companies.
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.201]  And I had numerous...
[00:58:27.915 --> 00:58:35.577]  Military and technical satellite engineers come to me in a panic, wanting to tell me how they gave me specific documents in 1993.
[00:58:36.217 --> 00:58:37.437]  Well, just stay there.
[00:58:38.198 --> 00:58:38.978]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:39.018 --> 00:58:40.138]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:41.358 --> 00:58:46.019]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.832 --> 00:58:58.453]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.133 --> 00:59:00.173]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.893 --> 00:59:02.013]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.654 --> 00:59:03.514]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.254 --> 00:59:05.154]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.174 --> 00:59:09.415]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.975 --> 00:59:14.116]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.177 --> 00:59:16.937]  All right, folks.
[00:59:17.337 --> 00:59:20.798]  Now into our number two wide-open phones.
[00:59:20.818 --> 00:59:22.058]  We're talking about one of the top...
[00:59:22.691 --> 00:59:27.315]  Communist generals gave a press conference sanctioned by the government, threatening to destroy 200 U.S.
[00:59:27.716 --> 00:59:32.120]  cities if we interfere in the CHICOM takeover of Taiwan in any way.
[00:59:33.521 --> 00:59:39.887]  New developments on the London bombings of last Thursday, now eight days ago.
[00:59:40.740 --> 00:59:43.422]  Just masses of news covering the police state.
[00:59:43.462 --> 00:59:44.563]  Just so many issues.
[00:59:44.623 --> 00:59:46.244]  It's all coming up.
[00:59:46.264 --> 00:59:47.284]  We're talking to Dr. Deagle.
[00:59:47.685 --> 00:59:51.127]  Dr. Deagle, you know, I'm not doubting what you're saying.
[00:59:51.147 --> 00:59:53.329]  I mean, I know that it's in my film, Police State 3.
[00:59:53.369 --> 00:59:59.813]  But the official government news agencies of South Korea reported that in 2002...
[01:00:02.411 --> 01:00:09.037]  A dummy missile was fired and hit Alaska, and then our government told them to shut up about it because they didn't want to scare people.
[01:00:09.057 --> 01:00:13.420]  I mean, how can we invade Iraq and say they're a threat while North Korea is launching test missiles at us?
[01:00:14.061 --> 01:00:28.332]  I know the Russians during the 60s from subs fired test missiles that blew up over the areas of the North Pole, testing hitting the U.S., but I don't know if I can believe the intel he was given that they fired one that blew up over St.
[01:00:28.392 --> 01:00:30.494]  Louis because still some wreckage would fall.
[01:00:31.491 --> 01:00:38.677]  And I could see them detonating it in space, but I couldn't see them detonating it over St.
[01:00:38.717 --> 01:00:39.078]  Louis.
[01:00:40.058 --> 01:00:41.139]  Miles over St.
[01:00:41.159 --> 01:00:41.440]  Louis.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:42.601]  It was in space.
[01:00:43.281 --> 01:00:45.944]  Oh, 110 miles would be space, yeah.
[01:00:45.964 --> 01:00:46.184]  Right.
[01:00:46.544 --> 01:00:50.187]  And Colonel Wills was the head of Strategic Defense Command for NORAD.
[01:00:50.467 --> 01:00:56.873]  So he actually personally brought me through some of the most secure places inside NORAD that even if you have high-level clearance, you don't get.
[01:00:56.893 --> 01:00:57.774]  Now...
[01:00:58.993 --> 01:01:03.614]  My contacts inside Lucent Technologies, Lockheed Martin, and other companies, they were all panicking.
[01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:05.454]  And they would talk to me because I was their doctor.
[01:01:05.914 --> 01:01:27.158]  And they told me specifically, and I got the documents proving it, that in 1993, through the Iridium Satellite Project, the American government under Clinton passed technologies through Lockheed Martin and Sputnik in London, England, to the Communist Chinese, where they put an uplink, and to the People's Republican Army Strategic Rocket Forces, as well as the Russians,
[01:01:27.773 --> 01:01:29.935]  Because they didn't have accurate targeting of U.S.
[01:01:29.995 --> 01:01:39.145]  cities, so they could make sure they could target large... No, no, no, that's publicly admitted that our government gave them targeting technology, MERV technology, guidance systems.
[01:01:39.525 --> 01:01:42.248]  Again, why would our government do that, Dr. Deagle?
[01:01:42.528 --> 01:01:47.473]  Well, I'll tell you, from all of my various travels and contacts, you're right on.
[01:01:48.374 --> 01:01:50.955]  The dialectic is they've transferred our jobs.
[01:01:51.015 --> 01:01:53.317]  They're transferring our technology, including micro-nukes.
[01:01:53.357 --> 01:01:57.519]  I had people down at Los Alamos tell me specifically years before this came out.
[01:01:57.539 --> 01:01:58.519]  Well, that all came out.
[01:01:58.719 --> 01:01:58.919]  Right.
[01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:02.701]  They're doing this on purpose because they don't mind 10 or 20 U.S.
[01:02:02.721 --> 01:02:03.682]  cities hit with nukes.
[01:02:04.864 --> 01:02:08.185]  They don't mind the fact that we might have 10 or 20 million people killed.
[01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:11.367]  They'll be able to re-engineer our society forever.
[01:02:11.687 --> 01:02:24.232]  Right, and in fact, I can tell you this very briefly, inside of the military industrial complex and the people who are freaked out by this that are scientists, they see our government as doing everything possible to put us into a global control grid against the military.
[01:02:24.252 --> 01:02:30.514]  Well, I'll tell you what proves this is PDD-60, which I should have pointed out last hour, Bush didn't rescind.
[01:02:31.152 --> 01:02:40.714]  We are under PDD-60 that Clinton has signed right now, and what PDD-60 does is says, publicly, we will absorb a strike before deciding what to do.
[01:02:40.734 --> 01:02:48.496]  And they took the launch codes off the subs so the admirals and the captains can't defend us.
[01:02:48.836 --> 01:02:49.036]  Right.
[01:02:49.076 --> 01:02:51.737]  In fact, I was told by the highest levels inside the U.S.
[01:02:51.757 --> 01:03:00.059]  Strategic Air Command, Space Command, and so on, that we were actually designed, specifically our policies, to absorb a first strike and kill millions.
[01:03:00.768 --> 01:03:01.688]  That's their policy.
[01:03:03.469 --> 01:03:04.089]  It's insane.
[01:03:04.689 --> 01:03:05.849]  And it makes me so angry.
[01:03:05.889 --> 01:03:11.530]  And, for example, we know, and I've known this for many years now, that they have suitcase nukes already in U.S.
[01:03:11.550 --> 01:03:14.651]  cities for years, that they purposely can see them from space.
[01:03:14.691 --> 01:03:16.091]  They fly jets over every U.S.
[01:03:16.131 --> 01:03:20.432]  city every week to look for radioisotopes they can see up to 400 meters below the ground.
[01:03:20.992 --> 01:03:23.692]  And shielding doesn't stop, and it doesn't matter if it's lead-shielded.
[01:03:24.032 --> 01:03:26.853]  And they do this on purpose to put us in this position.
[01:03:29.463 --> 01:03:34.764]  Well, I know they have a narrow beam they can look down that deep, but what about wide scans?
[01:03:35.664 --> 01:03:41.026]  Yeah, they have a satellite imaging technology that can actually wide scan an area, and then they can bring jets in over every city.
[01:03:41.286 --> 01:03:42.026]  They do it every week.
[01:03:43.706 --> 01:03:47.587]  Yeah, I've seen the helicopters scanning before with a huge apparatus below them.
[01:03:48.688 --> 01:03:50.208]  All right, Dr. Deagle, good to hear from you.
[01:03:50.228 --> 01:03:50.528]  Take care.
[01:03:53.337 --> 01:03:54.818]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.038 --> 01:03:58.120]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:02.142]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.182 --> 01:04:06.444]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.785 --> 01:04:10.567]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.627 --> 01:04:12.468]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.788 --> 01:04:15.972]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.032 --> 01:04:20.737]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.917 --> 01:04:23.960]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:27.004]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.484 --> 01:04:33.611]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.131 --> 01:04:34.632]  We're good to go.
[01:04:52.609 --> 01:04:53.390]  Terrorism.
[01:04:53.530 --> 01:04:54.290]  Terrorism.
[01:04:54.390 --> 01:04:55.231]  Chemical attacks.
[01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:55.972]  Dirty bombs.
[01:04:56.052 --> 01:04:56.472]  Fallout.
[01:04:56.552 --> 01:04:57.553]  Biological attack.
[01:04:57.733 --> 01:04:58.273]  Anthrax.
[01:04:58.334 --> 01:05:00.435]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:05:00.715 --> 01:05:02.317]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:02.557 --> 01:05:05.019]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.419 --> 01:05:19.990]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.030 --> 01:05:20.350]  government.
[01:05:20.511 --> 01:05:22.332]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:22.692 --> 01:05:28.595]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:28.735 --> 01:05:33.217]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:05:33.478 --> 01:05:40.201]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.261 --> 01:05:42.902]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:52.737 --> 01:05:59.619]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[01:06:00.159 --> 01:06:05.581]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:06:05.981 --> 01:06:16.003]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[01:06:16.123 --> 01:06:18.484]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:06:18.864 --> 01:06:21.885]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[01:06:22.365 --> 01:06:23.566]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:31.171]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:06:31.431 --> 01:06:33.172]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[01:06:33.493 --> 01:06:45.261]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:06:45.761 --> 01:06:50.104]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:06:57.961 --> 01:06:58.601]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.262 --> 01:07:00.302]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.023 --> 01:07:02.123]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.783 --> 01:07:03.604]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.364 --> 01:07:06.285]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.305 --> 01:07:09.847]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.107 --> 01:07:14.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.689 --> 01:07:20.632]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 p.m., back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:07:21.232 --> 01:07:26.935]  You know, I know that in about six months I'll be talking about one of the top communist Chinese generals, the top three.
[01:07:27.777 --> 01:07:32.921]  And China gave a press conference threatening to nuke several hundred, 200 U.S.
[01:07:33.402 --> 01:07:35.463]  cities and kill over 100 million people.
[01:07:36.764 --> 01:07:41.748]  I'll talk about this six months from now, and I will get an email denying that he said this.
[01:07:41.768 --> 01:07:43.349]  I mean, I was accused of this years ago.
[01:07:43.369 --> 01:07:45.651]  Every time I'd read their quotes, threatening to kill us.
[01:07:46.452 --> 01:07:50.475]  And in the past, it was just, well, you take Beijing, we'll take L.A.
[01:07:52.016 --> 01:07:55.639]  You know, you take this province, we'll take New York.
[01:07:56.474 --> 01:07:59.035]  Now it's just official government press conference.
[01:07:59.095 --> 01:08:00.135]  We'll nuke you.
[01:08:00.816 --> 01:08:01.676]  We'll hit your U.S.
[01:08:01.716 --> 01:08:02.136]  cities.
[01:08:04.197 --> 01:08:05.397]  That's not even tit for tat.
[01:08:05.417 --> 01:08:10.179]  They're saying that we do anything militarily against their ships or any other property.
[01:08:10.199 --> 01:08:11.420]  They've got the Panama Canal.
[01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:17.542]  Our government's giving them that, giving them the nuke secrets, giving them the supercomputers, giving them the guidance systems, giving them all of it.
[01:08:18.841 --> 01:08:28.569]  And in the late 90s, took us off MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction, and put us on to PDD-60, saying we will absorb strikes before deciding what to do.
[01:08:30.331 --> 01:08:39.358]  And in the 1990s, of course, Rumsfeld on the board of ABB helped transfer the reactors to North Korea so they could develop dozens of nuclear weapons.
[01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:41.700]  With the systems they got, they could produce over 100.
[01:08:43.382 --> 01:08:45.484]  They reportedly already produced over 15 of them.
[01:08:46.966 --> 01:08:48.486]  But none of that's a threat, folks.
[01:08:48.567 --> 01:08:49.227]  It's you.
[01:08:49.287 --> 01:08:50.487]  We've got to have a checkpoint.
[01:08:50.507 --> 01:08:51.928]  We've got to have the cops searching you.
[01:08:52.648 --> 01:08:54.308]  That'll leave the borders wide open, though.
[01:08:56.389 --> 01:09:04.732]  Okay, I want to get into the London bombing, because now our government's saying why there are suicide bombers all over America.
[01:09:05.232 --> 01:09:07.212]  And we've got to do what we talked about last year.
[01:09:07.232 --> 01:09:10.993]  We've got to have troops at checkpoints, on the roads, the trains.
[01:09:11.073 --> 01:09:14.134]  The police have got to search you at the shopping malls.
[01:09:14.174 --> 01:09:15.755]  We've got to take all your freedoms.
[01:09:17.482 --> 01:09:28.709]  All your freedoms away, but we've got to have record Muslim influx of immigrants into the country, and totally open borders, unless you want to leave the country.
[01:09:29.009 --> 01:09:44.320]  Now it's really hard to leave, but under the NAFTA Agenda 21 corridors, they're building the big NAFTA highway right now, right outside Austin, and you'll just legally drive right across into the U.S., but you won't exit right away into Mexico.
[01:09:45.382 --> 01:09:48.343]  From Alaska to Chile, they're building the highway.
[01:09:48.403 --> 01:09:49.943]  I mean, it's incredible!
[01:09:51.723 --> 01:09:52.624]  These are the facts.
[01:09:53.184 --> 01:09:54.584]  Let's just blast through your calls.
[01:09:54.624 --> 01:09:59.845]  I'm giving each caller 60 seconds, because I want to get to more of this news, but I also want to take your calls.
[01:10:00.505 --> 01:10:04.386]  Let's go to David, and then we'll go to Kevin, Mike, Tim, and then Robert.
[01:10:04.786 --> 01:10:06.687]  David in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:10:06.727 --> 01:10:07.707]  How are you doing?
[01:10:07.987 --> 01:10:08.347]  Pretty good.
[01:10:09.047 --> 01:10:10.308]  I was in Vietnam in 1969 in October...
[01:10:13.518 --> 01:10:16.760]  1969, I got on a plane and went to Sydney for R&R.
[01:10:17.561 --> 01:10:25.565]  While I was there, there was a report in Australia that the Red Chinese Army had released a report, a study they'd done,
[01:10:26.345 --> 01:10:29.527]  Where at that time they concluded they could win a nuclear war.
[01:10:29.747 --> 01:10:36.090]  Yeah, because they had 850 million people, and they said they would only lose 200 and something mil.
[01:10:36.431 --> 01:10:39.432]  Yeah, they'd still have like a zillion billion people left over.
[01:10:39.452 --> 01:10:40.553]  Yeah, that was a big report.
[01:10:40.593 --> 01:10:45.495]  In fact, the official Communist Party put that report out in their newspapers and said, we want to have a war with you.
[01:10:45.956 --> 01:10:52.059]  Okay, well... But remember, why would our government then move all the jobs there, give them the Panama Canal, give them all the secrets?
[01:10:52.359 --> 01:10:53.640]  Why don't you answer that question?
[01:10:54.955 --> 01:10:58.056]  Well, it's because we have traitors in the government, simply put.
[01:10:58.176 --> 01:11:03.438]  But I was just calling in... Look, I'm not worried about the Communist Chinese threatening to nuke 200 cities.
[01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:03.938]  Who cares?
[01:11:04.318 --> 01:11:10.781]  Let's worry about... No, let's leave the borders open and give all our freedoms up, because Al-Qaeda, which is admittedly CIA, might get us.
[01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:12.141]  Well, that's true.
[01:11:12.401 --> 01:11:13.702]  I was just calling in because I...
[01:11:14.378 --> 01:11:17.159]  Out of this country, and I didn't know if the report appeared in this country.
[01:11:17.179 --> 01:11:18.519]  Well, I'm being sarcastic right now.
[01:11:18.699 --> 01:11:19.060]  Oh, okay.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.240]  We shouldn't worry about North Korea.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.721]  We shouldn't worry about China.
[01:11:22.741 --> 01:11:23.981]  Let's worry about Saddam.
[01:11:24.501 --> 01:11:29.843]  Well, just for years, their domestic policy objectives have been to reduce their population base.
[01:11:30.618 --> 01:11:37.862]  And the fact that at that time, if they had nukes, but they had no deliveries... Yeah, their one-child policy, now they've got 50 million more men than women.
[01:11:38.122 --> 01:11:45.086]  Yeah, but they could take every nuke in existence in 1969 and still have enough people left over to regenerate.
[01:11:45.747 --> 01:11:51.790]  And their population base now is greater than what it was in 1969, and it was just a jaw-dropping report.
[01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:55.372]  It's almost as if it's in their domestic policy interest...
[01:11:55.839 --> 01:11:58.180]  To get into a nuclear exchange with the United States.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:11:59.940]  Well, that's a very famous report.
[01:11:59.961 --> 01:12:03.382]  I forget the particular name of it, but I remember my dad talking about it when I was a kid.
[01:12:03.642 --> 01:12:04.022]  Okay.
[01:12:04.142 --> 01:12:05.302]  I have read the report.
[01:12:05.683 --> 01:12:09.044]  Okay, well, I never knew if the report made it to the States because I wasn't in the States.
[01:12:09.064 --> 01:12:09.444]  No, I'm glad.
[01:12:09.544 --> 01:12:10.404]  I'd forgotten about that.
[01:12:10.444 --> 01:12:11.805]  I mean, I'm glad you brought that report up.
[01:12:12.485 --> 01:12:15.446]  But it's just jaw-dropping if you think about it, and that's all I got for you.
[01:12:15.706 --> 01:12:16.907]  All right, thank you for the call.
[01:12:16.967 --> 01:12:17.607]  Great points.
[01:12:18.187 --> 01:12:19.568]  And again, none of this makes sense.
[01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:21.128]  Why give them the Panama Canal?
[01:12:21.268 --> 01:12:22.308]  Our government didn't even bid.
[01:12:23.049 --> 01:12:23.629]  We built it.
[01:12:24.815 --> 01:12:26.136]  Panama wanted us to stay.
[01:12:27.717 --> 01:12:28.177]  But no.
[01:12:28.197 --> 01:12:31.480]  I mean, our government runs Panama.
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:33.241]  They took it in 89, took Noriega out.
[01:12:34.242 --> 01:12:35.282]  You wasn't paying us cut.
[01:12:37.644 --> 01:12:41.327]  And they told us that war was because somebody kidnapped five students.
[01:12:41.387 --> 01:12:44.349]  And when the students got saved, I saw on the news going, we weren't kidnapped.
[01:12:44.389 --> 01:12:48.051]  The special forces came in and said they were protecting us at our dorm.
[01:12:48.091 --> 01:12:49.572]  We don't know what was going on.
[01:12:50.313 --> 01:12:52.915]  So over some cocaine money, we sent troops in.
[01:12:53.835 --> 01:12:54.016]  But...
[01:12:55.740 --> 01:12:58.522]  Give the Communist Chinese the port and they've got their troops.
[01:12:58.802 --> 01:12:59.682]  Folks, that's admitted.
[01:13:01.624 --> 01:13:02.924]  Why give them all our jobs?
[01:13:03.005 --> 01:13:04.145]  Why give them our factories?
[01:13:04.205 --> 01:13:07.447]  Why give them the technology to build missiles that can hit all our cities?
[01:13:07.848 --> 01:13:08.688]  Why, why, why?
[01:13:08.788 --> 01:13:17.333]  Why order NORAD and the Pentagon and Space Command to stand down and to track missiles coming in and to accept the strike?
[01:13:17.634 --> 01:13:18.654]  PDD-60!
[01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:21.856]  By the way, police, you don't believe you're driving around in your cars right now.
[01:13:22.076 --> 01:13:23.077]  When you get home tonight...
[01:13:24.392 --> 01:13:25.713]  Government agents, all of you.
[01:13:25.733 --> 01:13:27.014]  FBI people, probably still ignorant.
[01:13:27.034 --> 01:13:27.754]  You don't even know about this.
[01:13:27.774 --> 01:13:29.535]  You want to know who you work for?
[01:13:29.555 --> 01:13:30.736]  Well, sit down.
[01:13:30.776 --> 01:13:39.481]  I want you to type PDD-60, nuclear stand-down, into a search engine, and you'll get all the big papers from back in the late 90s.
[01:13:39.521 --> 01:13:43.784]  And you'll find a few when Bush got in, where he kept PDD-60 in place.
[01:13:45.005 --> 01:13:45.685]  So let me see.
[01:13:45.725 --> 01:13:49.287]  The cops are out in Austin running checkpoints after the London bombing.
[01:13:49.468 --> 01:13:50.128]  It's on the news.
[01:13:50.688 --> 01:13:53.070]  Got to search our cars randomly, they're saying, because of the attacks.
[01:13:53.712 --> 01:14:00.676]  The border's wide open, but we've given the Panama Canal and Freeport and the Bahamas a huge base to them.
[01:14:00.696 --> 01:14:02.577]  They're moving in military equipment.
[01:14:02.597 --> 01:14:06.780]  We've got all this stuff going on.
[01:14:08.881 --> 01:14:11.403]  But the American people are a threat and have got to be watched.
[01:14:11.483 --> 01:14:22.249]  And Iraq's a threat because they had Scud missiles 14 years ago, 13 years ago, that most of them broke up because they were so old, 30 years old, being launched.
[01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:24.406]  It barely even hit Israel.
[01:14:24.466 --> 01:14:25.407]  Most of them broke up.
[01:14:26.407 --> 01:14:36.110]  So, because the guys got some mustard gas that, you know, I mean, a chemical plant having a leak in Houston is more dangerous than chlorine gas.
[01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:44.392]  So let's give up all our freedom to have guys in black masks searching all our houses looking for narcotics the government shipped in to begin with.
[01:14:44.412 --> 01:14:49.734]  And let's take national ID cards because Al Qaeda is going to get us.
[01:14:50.954 --> 01:14:52.735]  Which is admittedly a CIA created group
[01:14:53.710 --> 01:15:01.693]  And meanwhile, one of the top communist generals gives a press conference saying, we'll destroy 200 of your cities.
[01:15:01.753 --> 01:15:04.475]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Alabama.
[01:15:04.515 --> 01:15:05.255]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:15:06.475 --> 01:15:10.517]  Doing a worldwide transmission, sir.
[01:15:10.537 --> 01:15:11.858]  I love it, man.
[01:15:11.918 --> 01:15:12.358]  I love it.
[01:15:13.817 --> 01:15:15.098]  This is my third time calling.
[01:15:15.118 --> 01:15:20.162]  The first time I called you, I called you and told you that I am a general in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:15:20.402 --> 01:15:23.104]  And quite frankly, the time for talking is done.
[01:15:23.624 --> 01:15:27.147]  It's time that we start mobilizing, start getting people together.
[01:15:27.707 --> 01:15:31.610]  You, sir, control a very big media outlet.
[01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:32.911]  I need your help.
[01:15:33.411 --> 01:15:35.913]  I gave the guy that answered the phone my phone number.
[01:15:36.153 --> 01:15:42.838]  I'm encouraging everybody that's listening to this to call you up and to leave them your name and your phone number.
[01:15:43.405 --> 01:15:47.247]  And then, look, we'll get together sometime in the near future.
[01:15:47.287 --> 01:15:56.092]  Within a year, you set something up for one year from today, and everybody and their mama stop what they're doing, put their little lives down.
[01:15:56.312 --> 01:15:58.093]  We can go to Washington, D.C.
[01:15:58.453 --> 01:16:01.795]  I'm talking 10 million strong, and we'll handle business.
[01:16:02.696 --> 01:16:03.556]  What do you think, ma'am?
[01:16:04.256 --> 01:16:06.418]  I appreciate your call.
[01:16:06.638 --> 01:16:10.360]  And, Kevin, let me elaborate on this.
[01:16:11.915 --> 01:16:15.336]  Instinctively, at a primitive level, we all want to rally.
[01:16:16.437 --> 01:16:17.497]  You know, like the Scots.
[01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:26.641]  You know, ten days from now, spread the word, everyone rally in the valley, and we're going to go take on the English.
[01:16:28.081 --> 01:16:29.542]  That isn't how things work today.
[01:16:30.382 --> 01:16:34.864]  Did you know if I actually got on air and started saying, let's all rally and go take over D.C.
[01:16:36.405 --> 01:16:39.706]  on this date next year, I would be arrested this evening?
[01:16:41.627 --> 01:16:47.110]  Number one, I don't believe we should do that, because I've thought this through, and I'm not knocking you, Kevin, but you've got to think about this.
[01:16:48.751 --> 01:16:50.232]  Number one, I don't think that's a good strategy.
[01:16:50.292 --> 01:16:55.555]  Number two, if I said, we're going to go take the government over on this date, you know, I'd be arrested tonight.
[01:16:57.136 --> 01:16:57.996]  Not tomorrow.
[01:16:59.497 --> 01:17:00.337]  Not a week from now.
[01:17:00.497 --> 01:17:01.518]  I'd be arrested.
[01:17:02.222 --> 01:17:06.045]  And anybody that talks like that, who isn't arrested, is an agent provocateur.
[01:17:06.085 --> 01:17:07.165]  We've tracked these people back.
[01:17:07.185 --> 01:17:08.446]  I'm not saying you, Kevin.
[01:17:08.466 --> 01:17:12.509]  I mean, there's some patriot leaders who shoot their mouths off like this, and they're government.
[01:17:14.230 --> 01:17:22.656]  Folks, back in the late 70s, hundreds of thousands of farmers peacefully tried to go protest in D.C., and the police came out in riot gear and beat up men, women, and children.
[01:17:23.965 --> 01:17:30.409]  The globalists have to carry out terror attacks against themselves, try to demonize patriots so they can come after us.
[01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:32.551]  It's because we're peacefully exposing them.
[01:17:36.954 --> 01:17:39.075]  And also, let's just say I was going to be a nexus point.
[01:17:39.135 --> 01:17:45.036]  A lot of people call me and say, it's your job to give my 9-11 group coverage.
[01:17:45.076 --> 01:17:47.337]  It's your job to network us all together.
[01:17:47.537 --> 01:17:55.179]  Folks, I literally have to hurry to brush my teeth, hurry to spend a few minutes with my children, hurry to pay bills, hurry from radio interview to TV interview.
[01:17:55.779 --> 01:17:57.019]  I literally am killing myself.
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:01.821]  And so I can't exchange phone numbers and call everybody back.
[01:18:02.121 --> 01:18:03.441]  It's hard to read the e-mails.
[01:18:04.108 --> 01:18:06.629]  It's hard to write articles about all the tips you give us.
[01:18:06.729 --> 01:18:11.232]  I mean, I... You need to start a peaceful 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:18:11.272 --> 01:18:14.614]  You need to educate people in your town, your city, and be peaceful about it.
[01:18:16.115 --> 01:18:16.455]  Okay?
[01:18:16.795 --> 01:18:20.537]  The average cop, the average FBI guy, is just like everybody else.
[01:18:20.657 --> 01:18:21.317]  Dumb as dirt.
[01:18:21.357 --> 01:18:22.778]  Doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground.
[01:18:23.298 --> 01:18:24.459]  Never put two and two together.
[01:18:24.779 --> 01:18:26.400]  We've got to educate these men and women.
[01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.121]  Most of them are coming over to our side.
[01:18:28.741 --> 01:18:31.623]  Not running around, shooting our mouths off about violence!
[01:18:32.737 --> 01:18:34.878]  That's exactly what the globalists want.
[01:18:35.438 --> 01:18:37.058]  That's exactly what they need.
[01:18:38.899 --> 01:18:39.339]  Okay?
[01:18:40.119 --> 01:18:45.181]  Start worrying about the globalists carrying out a nuclear attack and setting up martial law.
[01:18:46.081 --> 01:18:49.722]  Educate people who has the motive because then they won't be able to carry it out.
[01:18:50.262 --> 01:18:51.683]  We'll be back with more calls and more news.
[01:18:53.820 --> 01:18:57.922]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[01:19:16.172 --> 01:19:16.592]  We're good to go.
[01:19:36.758 --> 01:19:38.060]  Or call 888-216-2461.
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:38.300]  That's 888-216-2461.
[01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:59.239]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:03.682]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:03.983 --> 01:20:04.523]  We listened.
[01:20:04.843 --> 01:20:09.827]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:10.107 --> 01:20:10.587]  We listened.
[01:20:10.968 --> 01:20:14.010]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:14.430 --> 01:20:14.971]  We listened.
[01:20:15.431 --> 01:20:18.473]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[01:20:18.473 --> 01:20:19.114]  We're good to go.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:46.001]  We're good to go.
[01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:46.781]  We're good to go.
[01:20:46.841 --> 01:20:47.882]  We're good to go.

[01:21:56.594 --> 01:22:02.238]  Already a number one beverage in Asia, Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[01:22:02.538 --> 01:22:08.402]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[01:22:08.522 --> 01:22:14.487]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.

[01:23:04.459 --> 01:23:06.961]  Let me just say something else to Kevin in Alabama.
[01:23:07.701 --> 01:23:10.563]  He wants to have 10 million people go forcibly take over D.C.
[01:23:11.564 --> 01:23:12.445]  Do you think D.C.
[01:23:12.525 --> 01:23:13.105]  runs things?
[01:23:13.705 --> 01:23:15.106]  That's another misnomer.
[01:23:15.947 --> 01:23:16.487]  D.C.
[01:23:16.547 --> 01:23:22.051]  are a bunch of criminal managers for the globalists predominantly based in Europe.
[01:23:22.071 --> 01:23:23.412]  We're a private corporation.
[01:23:23.873 --> 01:23:27.075]  They own the Federal Reserve private stock of those 12-member banks.
[01:23:29.051 --> 01:23:31.493]  And the globalists would love that if there was a Civil War.
[01:23:31.533 --> 01:23:33.874]  Did you know the British funded the Civil War?
[01:23:34.755 --> 01:23:38.858]  The Russian Tsar funded the North, and the British funded the South.
[01:23:38.898 --> 01:23:45.542]  You know, you'd think because I have family in the Civil War, from here in Texas, that I'd be a Southern boy.
[01:23:46.103 --> 01:23:58.091]  I am proud of my, you know, quote, Southern heritage, but I'm strong enough mentally and historically to admit the truth about the war against the states, the war against independence.
[01:23:58.935 --> 01:24:08.745]  There were real reasons that the South rebelled, but it was manipulated and funded by the British to break up this country.
[01:24:10.326 --> 01:24:14.690]  And the Tsars were trying to fund the North's continual control.
[01:24:16.472 --> 01:24:18.374]  And so it's the same story over and over again.
[01:24:18.394 --> 01:24:20.456]  So we hear these comments about, let's go take D.C.
[01:24:20.576 --> 01:24:20.716]  over.
[01:24:21.294 --> 01:24:22.095]  They're just puppets.
[01:24:22.175 --> 01:24:23.076]  Bush is a puppet.
[01:24:23.377 --> 01:24:24.618]  Bill Clinton was a puppet.
[01:24:24.658 --> 01:24:26.060]  We've got to understand that.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:30.946]  We've got to unlearn what we've been told, what we've learned in the past.
[01:24:32.427 --> 01:24:34.570]  Our government put Mao Zedong in.
[01:24:35.191 --> 01:24:36.853]  Our government put Lenin in.
[01:24:38.150 --> 01:24:51.499]  Our government used communism to consolidate wealth, then, quote, communism falls, and it's given to a few robber barons, a few oligarchs, and whenever they get in trouble, we find out that Lord Rothschild really owns the companies.
[01:24:51.539 --> 01:24:55.442]  That's, you know, London Telegraph, Financial Times of London.
[01:24:55.482 --> 01:24:57.543]  I mean, it's a joke!
[01:24:57.563 --> 01:25:02.467]  You've got a bunch of scumbags living in castles over in Europe who own our economy,
[01:25:02.987 --> 01:25:06.993]  Who used the slaves in China to leverage out our industrial base.
[01:25:07.273 --> 01:25:08.896]  It's all like a big monopoly game.
[01:25:10.778 --> 01:25:14.504]  And they'll ride this sucker out while we have some limited exchange with China?
[01:25:15.259 --> 01:25:16.679]  And out of that will come your world government?
[01:25:16.699 --> 01:25:31.302]  Well, after the limited exchange of, you know, 012, we just can't ever, we just all got to have microchips, we all got to be forced drugged, we all got to be controlled, because, you know, after the bio-releases of 08, we just can't, you know, we just can't do it anymore.
[01:25:31.702 --> 01:25:34.142]  We have ruthless social architects.
[01:25:34.222 --> 01:25:36.643]  Look at all the crazy evil people in history.
[01:25:37.183 --> 01:25:41.664]  All the crazy emperors and lords and dukes and all the things they did.
[01:25:42.164 --> 01:25:43.284]  The power corrupts.
[01:25:43.764 --> 01:25:46.246]  An absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:50.930]  And we're just a bunch of gullible, naive people that can't put two and two together.
[01:25:51.991 --> 01:25:57.195]  Violence is not... In fact, it's just coming out in mainstream news today, but we told you six, seven years ago.
[01:25:57.976 --> 01:25:59.257]  We told you day one, actually.
[01:26:00.217 --> 01:26:05.822]  I guess almost 11 years ago, coming up on the 11th anniversary here in about six, seven months of Oklahoma City.
[01:26:05.882 --> 01:26:13.088]  It's now federal prosecutors and other people in federal offices are going public in newspapers saying, yeah, the government knew, the government...
[01:26:13.787 --> 01:26:17.629]  I mean, it's all coming out with OKC, but it'll be in the back of the newspaper!
[01:26:18.810 --> 01:26:21.271]  It's time to figure this out, folks, or it's over!
[01:26:24.673 --> 01:26:25.153]  Oh, man.
[01:26:25.813 --> 01:26:28.335]  Let's go to Mike in New York.
[01:26:28.375 --> 01:26:28.935]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:26:29.815 --> 01:26:30.396]  Hi, Alex.
[01:26:30.416 --> 01:26:33.157]  Great to talk to you again, and it's been a while.
[01:26:33.237 --> 01:26:33.917]  Great show.
[01:26:34.698 --> 01:26:41.181]  I don't know what to say except God bless you, and for everybody in your audience, support Alex.
[01:26:41.421 --> 01:26:42.522]  Get his latest video.
[01:26:43.027 --> 01:27:09.909]  Make copies, share it with the people you know, help wake them up, because Alex is one of the only guys out there, along with the whole network, the network is great, telling you the way it really is, waking you up to the real facts, exposing the big lie for what it is, and trying to make you all aware that you've got to get your minds out of the gutter, out of the way from the boob tube and all the nonsense, look for the truth, and start to get your lives in order, because we're in deep trouble.
[01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:10.750]  And Alex...
[01:27:11.889 --> 01:27:18.831]  You know, like I told you in the past, if you ever recall, the only thing that's going to save us is all of us living virtuously.
[01:27:20.011 --> 01:27:21.192]  We're at the end of the rope.
[01:27:21.352 --> 01:27:23.492]  The traders have totally sold us out.
[01:27:23.932 --> 01:27:26.073]  You covered all that in perfect detail.
[01:27:26.633 --> 01:27:28.113]  They financed the commies in 1917.
[01:27:28.353 --> 01:27:31.894]  They backed Hitler to create World War II.
[01:27:32.275 --> 01:27:36.076]  And they're backing our most current enemy, the CHICOMs, for World War III.
[01:27:36.336 --> 01:27:37.556]  It's all going to come together.
[01:27:38.503 --> 01:27:39.765]  It's already happening.
[01:27:39.865 --> 01:27:41.487]  You're pointing it out perfectly.
[01:27:41.947 --> 01:27:46.852]  The only thing I can say, and trust me as I say this because I'm very close to the Lord.
[01:27:46.872 --> 01:27:48.494]  He's been with me since I was a kid.
[01:27:49.014 --> 01:27:52.498]  He's actually summoned me out of my body numerous times.
[01:27:52.618 --> 01:27:53.179]  Okay, sir.
[01:27:53.219 --> 01:27:53.739]  Make your point.
[01:27:54.040 --> 01:27:54.320]  Okay.
[01:27:55.106 --> 01:27:56.567]  He wants us to be virtuous.
[01:27:56.607 --> 01:27:58.127]  We're all in a testing ground.
[01:27:58.188 --> 01:28:02.870]  He's testing the Americans today to see if they love the freedom that they were born with.
[01:28:03.370 --> 01:28:08.432]  If they want to pursue God's way of living, which is to be virtuous, it's that simple.
[01:28:09.333 --> 01:28:14.695]  And stay away from all the vices, which are the traps that rob your health, your physical health, and your soul.
[01:28:15.516 --> 01:28:18.357]  And then we'll pray to the sinister forces.
[01:28:19.017 --> 01:28:24.320]  So we have to be virtuous, and then God will come to our aid, just like he did with the Founding Fathers.
[01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:28.370]  Well, I agree with you, and thanks for the call.
[01:28:29.151 --> 01:28:31.251]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:31.991 --> 01:28:37.813]  There is more on the Madrid situation, how it ties into London, how it ties into 9-11, how it ties into all of it.
[01:28:38.453 --> 01:28:40.413]  And your call is just so much news.
[01:28:40.433 --> 01:28:42.754]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.954 --> 01:28:44.875]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.355 --> 01:28:46.955]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.855 --> 01:28:50.576]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.479 --> 01:29:00.925]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.
[01:29:01.085 --> 01:29:05.269]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.
[01:29:05.489 --> 01:29:17.139]  By calling 1-888-PETS-911 or visiting 1-888-PETS-911.org, you will find the location of your closest adoption facility as well as tons of other information you need to know as a responsible pet owner.
[01:29:17.339 --> 01:29:18.960]  So when thinking adoption, think Pets 911.
[01:29:22.899 --> 01:29:24.600]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[01:29:24.760 --> 01:29:26.801]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[01:29:27.001 --> 01:29:27.681]  Prepare yourself.
[01:29:27.841 --> 01:29:31.543]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[01:29:39.026 --> 01:29:41.667]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[01:29:41.787 --> 01:29:43.368]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[01:29:43.608 --> 01:29:46.449]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[01:29:46.509 --> 01:29:47.230]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[01:29:53.351 --> 01:29:54.972]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.112 --> 01:29:59.193]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.353 --> 01:30:02.234]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.294 --> 01:30:08.996]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.196 --> 01:30:12.199]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:14.802]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:14.922 --> 01:30:25.093]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[01:30:25.273 --> 01:30:26.034]  M-T-B-E.
[01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:26.694]  Radon 222.
[01:30:27.174 --> 01:30:29.156]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[01:30:29.296 --> 01:30:30.136]  Even nitrates.
[01:30:30.417 --> 01:30:34.419]  And unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:34.559 --> 01:30:42.325]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.345 --> 01:30:42.785]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:42.845 --> 01:30:44.546]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:30:55.279 --> 01:30:59.364]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine, and I want to tell you about the sacral wedging.
[01:30:59.884 --> 01:31:02.267]  I don't endorse many products, but I'm endorsing this one.
[01:31:02.607 --> 01:31:09.675]  If you've got back pain, sciatica, hip pain, leg pain, knee pain, then you need to listen very closely to this message.
[01:31:10.140 --> 01:31:18.222]  For more than 10 years now, the Sacro Wedgie has helped thousands find relief from the symptoms and pain of back problems.
[01:31:18.582 --> 01:31:20.483]  Now all you have to do is go to their website.
[01:31:20.743 --> 01:31:23.024]  You can read the testimonials and read all about it.
[01:31:23.564 --> 01:31:27.405]  On the internet, it is sacrowedgie.com.
[01:31:27.785 --> 01:31:32.786]  S-A-C-R-O-W-E-D-G-Y dot com.
[01:31:32.967 --> 01:31:34.427]  Sacrowedgie.com.
[01:31:34.967 --> 01:31:36.369]  Or you can use the toll-free number.
[01:31:36.389 --> 01:31:37.211]  1-800-737-9295 That's 737-9295 Call them.
[01:31:37.231 --> 01:31:38.893]  It's only $29.95 and it really works.
[01:31:56.738 --> 01:31:57.218]  Don't worry.
[01:31:57.699 --> 01:31:59.280]  This show is documented.
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:02.502]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:03.503 --> 01:32:04.664]  All right, here's the deal.
[01:32:04.704 --> 01:32:07.526]  I'm going to talk to John in Ohio and Tim in Wisconsin.
[01:32:07.726 --> 01:32:12.209]  That's going to be it for news for the shower because there's a bunch of news I want to cover.
[01:32:13.450 --> 01:32:14.871]  Let's go to John in Ohio.
[01:32:14.911 --> 01:32:15.751]  John, you're on the air.
[01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:16.252]  Go ahead.
[01:32:16.972 --> 01:32:21.295]  Yes, Alex, could I ask whether you would have a Dr. Michael Parenti?
[01:32:21.355 --> 01:32:23.397]  That's a parent with an I. I think you'd get him at...
[01:32:24.150 --> 01:32:26.091]  michaelparenti.org or com.
[01:32:26.151 --> 01:32:27.871]  I can't remember which one it is.
[01:32:27.911 --> 01:32:29.872]  He's a scholar and a historian.
[01:32:29.892 --> 01:32:30.512]  Well, send me an email.
[01:32:31.172 --> 01:32:40.215]  Well, the point I'd like to make is that, you know, I find it heartbreaking because my official enlightenment came from a man, M.S.
[01:32:40.295 --> 01:32:50.739]  Armandoni, in the early 60s, who was massively exposing the military-industrial complex, the early shadow war in Vietnam.
[01:32:51.414 --> 01:32:53.195]  But he had a vulnerability.
[01:32:53.255 --> 01:32:54.336]  It was his Zionism.
[01:32:54.696 --> 01:33:04.043]  From that point on, when the movement began to oppose the policies of Israel, he turned into a total ally of the military-industrial complex.
[01:33:04.704 --> 01:33:16.733]  And I've got to say that I feel that your influence by the alt-right anti-communist John Bridge Society may lead you into supporting the Project for a New American Century's ultimate plan for war with China.
[01:33:17.293 --> 01:33:17.954]  And I totally...
[01:33:18.444 --> 01:33:33.170]  You know, I have to disagree that, for instance, Operation Northwoods was based on some of the very same similar ultra-anti-communist attitudes of Lemnitzer, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and those who considered Kennedy soft on China, the Soviet Union, and the rest of it.
[01:33:33.190 --> 01:33:43.595]  They were going to kill us because they considered Kennedy too soft on Cuba, China, and the Soviet Union, using these staged attacks to frame up Cuba.
[01:33:44.715 --> 01:33:46.536]  And when you look at the plot in the 30s,
[01:33:47.563 --> 01:33:55.768]  The Rockefeller interest led a plot of top bankers to overthrow Roosevelt because they hated his mild liberalism.
[01:33:56.288 --> 01:34:00.771]  They considered him a communist, that he was somehow in league with the communists.
[01:34:00.791 --> 01:34:04.453]  They plotted to overthrow the United States in league with Hitler and Mussolini.
[01:34:04.533 --> 01:34:05.413]  It almost happened.
[01:34:05.453 --> 01:34:06.674]  It was finally called off.
[01:34:07.735 --> 01:34:14.399]  I just have to believe that the United States government has always had this first-strike policy against these countries.
[01:34:14.479 --> 01:34:16.600]  It's not China that's been calling for
[01:34:17.168 --> 01:34:17.808]  We're good to go.
[01:34:41.130 --> 01:34:42.951]  Are going to threaten us.
[01:34:43.151 --> 01:34:50.455]  You know, I think it plays right into the hands of what was stated in Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, and the rest in the Project for a New American Century.
[01:34:50.475 --> 01:35:05.982]  They consider any country, but especially China, just by its mere existence, not threatening us and not really being a threat in a way that they're going to attack us just by their very existence and not being an obstacle towards this total mad plan for their plans for world domination.
[01:35:06.403 --> 01:35:07.003]  And I think that...
[01:35:07.762 --> 01:35:33.062]  You know, this idea that the communists, the whole policy of the United States elite, the Rockefellers and the bringing in of the Nazis, the anti-communist Nazis, was to use them against the Soviet Union, China, anyone that was either claimed to be communist or a deformed communist system, precisely because those systems were the hardest nut to crack in penetrating their resources.
[01:35:33.283 --> 01:35:34.424]  I'm going to stop you right there.
[01:35:36.345 --> 01:35:37.186]  You know, John...
[01:35:38.737 --> 01:35:40.137]  You're engaging in double-think.
[01:35:41.698 --> 01:35:46.860]  You accuse me of being sucked into their propaganda, and you've fallen book-line and sinker.
[01:35:48.140 --> 01:35:53.582]  You are in a rut so long that you cannot get outside and see the big picture.
[01:35:53.622 --> 01:35:54.722]  You see one half of it.
[01:35:54.762 --> 01:35:55.542]  Let me just stop you.
[01:35:57.683 --> 01:36:02.764]  I'm not beating the drum against China because of something the neocons said.
[01:36:03.665 --> 01:36:05.565]  This is all over Chinese newspapers.
[01:36:06.125 --> 01:36:07.746]  This is all over the Financial Times.
[01:36:08.524 --> 01:36:24.128]  They called a press conference, and one of their top generals, General Zub, said that if you even move weapons in here and target anything of ours, target it, we're going to destroy several hundred of your cities.
[01:36:24.208 --> 01:36:25.788]  Now, let me just stop you.
[01:36:26.288 --> 01:36:27.689]  I'll let you go for three minutes.
[01:36:27.709 --> 01:36:28.549]  Will you just let me talk?
[01:36:28.569 --> 01:36:29.149]  Sure.
[01:36:29.809 --> 01:36:30.390]  This is fair.
[01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.910]  Okay?
[01:36:33.190 --> 01:36:36.131]  Our government put Mao in, publicly.
[01:36:37.132 --> 01:36:39.074]  Our government gave them the Panama Canal.
[01:36:39.274 --> 01:36:47.161]  Our Fortune 500 went and celebrated 50 years of Mao's takeover in Tiananmen Square for the Fortune 500 meeting.
[01:36:47.782 --> 01:36:48.562]  They love it.
[01:36:49.023 --> 01:36:51.505]  Bush was the first ambassador to go in there.
[01:36:51.625 --> 01:36:52.466]  It's a deal.
[01:36:52.486 --> 01:36:54.928]  It's staged.
[01:36:55.547 --> 01:37:01.012]  With the leadership, the real war will be against the people and the populations.
[01:37:01.072 --> 01:37:02.773]  Did you not even hear?
[01:37:02.974 --> 01:37:05.656]  Why do you think Bill Clinton signed PDD-60?
[01:37:05.956 --> 01:37:06.997]  Why do you think Bush?
[01:37:07.638 --> 01:37:08.498]  He's so evil.
[01:37:08.618 --> 01:37:10.160]  Why do you agree with him for PDD-60?
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:12.121]  It will absorb strikes.
[01:37:12.222 --> 01:37:17.886]  They're trying, just like the Tim Park plan, at a certain level to get North Korea to do something.
[01:37:18.167 --> 01:37:23.031]  And I'm telling you, I don't know if you get your mind around this, that it is staged with China.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:34.445]  That World War IV, as a bunch of former CIA directors like Woolsey call it, is being set up, is being orchestrated.
[01:37:34.805 --> 01:37:36.286]  Al-Qaeda is manufactured.
[01:37:36.686 --> 01:37:39.368]  The Republican and Democratic fight is manufactured.
[01:37:39.728 --> 01:37:44.350]  The American Sino split is manufactured.
[01:37:44.690 --> 01:37:46.411]  We already have a global government.
[01:37:47.171 --> 01:37:52.494]  Look, our government, our criminal government, is doing everything it can to move everything to China.
[01:37:53.882 --> 01:37:55.664]  Do you compute that?
[01:37:55.704 --> 01:38:01.968]  Can you figure out that your precious communists have been controlled since day one?
[01:38:02.108 --> 01:38:04.630]  Can you compute it, John?
[01:38:04.650 --> 01:38:08.913]  It's really not true.
[01:38:08.953 --> 01:38:13.977]  The United States invaded, along with 14 other capitalist countries, the Soviet Union.
[01:38:14.917 --> 01:38:19.641]  The top industrialists in this country, the CIA, the Nazis brought into this country,
[01:38:20.103 --> 01:38:22.884]  We're based on total anti-communist opposition.
[01:38:22.904 --> 01:38:23.905]  No, no, let me stop you.
[01:38:23.945 --> 01:38:25.745]  That's one part of the dialectic.
[01:38:26.206 --> 01:38:41.132]  For the good men in the military to do evil things, to carry out bombings, gladio, the rest of it, quote, fighting the communists, building up the command structure, actually building up something very similar to what you'd call communism, you know, the government working with the corporations, more like fascism.
[01:38:41.672 --> 01:38:43.633]  Don't you understand the dialectic, John?
[01:38:44.193 --> 01:38:47.715]  No, I think that... Hey, talk about PDD.
[01:38:47.795 --> 01:38:48.775]  I want you to respond.
[01:38:49.075 --> 01:38:51.556]  Why did our government not even try to get the Panama Canal?
[01:38:52.837 --> 01:39:00.880]  Well, the fact is there was massive opposition to a century of controlling that area and actually creating it.
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:03.381]  Our government had just gone in and blown the country to bits.
[01:39:03.401 --> 01:39:04.281]  Totally controlled it.
[01:39:04.641 --> 01:39:05.682]  Answer my question.
[01:39:06.394 --> 01:39:13.339]  No, there was a fake fight in the House, and the Republicans had the supermajority in 2000, and the handover still continued.
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.761]  That is just not, John, data number one.
[01:39:16.082 --> 01:39:19.264]  Why did Bill Clinton sign PDD-60, or are you even aware of that?
[01:39:19.764 --> 01:39:28.171]  Well, I happen to know that the policy of the United States with Reagan has been, from that point on, has been first strike.
[01:39:28.758 --> 01:39:40.650]  John, you're a smart guy, but I heard you call in to a radio show the other day, and the guy was talking about Agenda 21, and you thought that was some Goebbels anti-commy propaganda.
[01:39:40.930 --> 01:39:48.037]  Agenda 21 is an official UN document written up by our corporations to have global treaties to steal private property.
[01:39:48.518 --> 01:39:49.319]  Or the corporations.
[01:39:49.759 --> 01:39:54.081]  I was referring to... Yeah, the point is, there's a bunch of stuff you're blind on.
[01:39:54.501 --> 01:40:00.983]  You're just like a neocon who can't see that Gonzalez is anti-gun for abortion.
[01:40:01.643 --> 01:40:02.804]  You're blind, buddy!
[01:40:02.824 --> 01:40:05.065]  And I can't spend all day with you.
[01:40:05.385 --> 01:40:06.225]  Listen to me, John.
[01:40:06.245 --> 01:40:08.426]  Well, you have this man on, Michael Parenti.
[01:40:09.232 --> 01:40:15.677]  You know what, I'm not going to have him on, because I won't even look into it, because you won't honestly deal with PDD-60.
[01:40:16.037 --> 01:40:17.418]  I will deal with it.
[01:40:17.458 --> 01:40:22.322]  Why would our government say we'll absorb a strike before deciding what to do?
[01:40:22.983 --> 01:40:27.066]  I don't know that your interpretation of that particular PDD-60 is accurate.
[01:40:27.086 --> 01:40:29.107]  The point is that the United States has had first strike up
[01:40:37.663 --> 01:40:39.384]  No, no, no.
[01:40:39.484 --> 01:40:47.549]  First strike is... Thank you for the call, John.
[01:40:47.589 --> 01:40:47.909]  That's it.
[01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:51.491]  There's no point in talking to somebody that doesn't know what they're talking about.
[01:40:51.511 --> 01:40:51.791]  Okay?
[01:40:52.751 --> 01:40:56.473]  There's first strike against banana republics that can't defend themselves.
[01:40:56.994 --> 01:40:59.935]  That's the empire going in and raiding the villages, basically.
[01:41:00.376 --> 01:41:02.957]  You know, like a bunch of barbarians jumping off a Viking ship.
[01:41:04.853 --> 01:41:10.957]  Don't you understand it's the U.S., it's Russia, it's Europe, it's China, it's Japan, ganging up on the third world?
[01:41:12.638 --> 01:41:14.319]  It's just like Thomas Barnett will tell you.
[01:41:14.419 --> 01:41:15.500]  China isn't the threat.
[01:41:15.980 --> 01:41:17.201]  No, it's the third world.
[01:41:17.241 --> 01:41:21.844]  Let's invade them, because they're easy pickings, and you can't figure that out.
[01:41:23.945 --> 01:41:29.509]  The Chinese leadership gives a press conference saying they'll destroy 200 U.S.
[01:41:29.889 --> 01:41:33.111]  cities, and you say it's some right-wing propaganda.
[01:41:34.389 --> 01:41:39.134]  Now, John, I gave you ten minutes, but I'm not going to... Literally, I'm about to vomit on the microphone.
[01:41:42.197 --> 01:41:43.798]  Our government didn't put Mao in.
[01:41:43.918 --> 01:41:45.960]  I mean, just... You know something?
[01:41:45.980 --> 01:41:47.362]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[01:41:47.942 --> 01:41:51.786]  Because you've got such a probably 30-year love fest with communism.
[01:41:52.805 --> 01:42:00.069]  So go put your Che Guevara shirt on, feel good about yourself, like all these pathetic leftists that don't know what they're talking about.
[01:42:00.169 --> 01:42:09.954]  It's like that idiot, Ward Churchill, getting up six months ago and going, they were Nazis in the towers, they deserve to die, Al-Qaeda's striking back against injustice.
[01:42:13.496 --> 01:42:16.878]  You know, good Americans hear that and go, my gosh, Bush must be good.
[01:42:16.938 --> 01:42:21.040]  Look at these leftist trash against the war, they're saying Al-Qaeda are heroes.
[01:42:22.216 --> 01:42:23.497]  Al-Qaeda's CIA.
[01:42:23.597 --> 01:42:26.798]  Al-Qaeda just took the fall for a globalist operation.
[01:42:28.199 --> 01:42:30.600]  Al-Qaeda didn't fly those planes into buildings from caves.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:32.701]  Al-Qaeda didn't make NORAD stand down.
[01:42:32.961 --> 01:42:34.542]  Al-Qaeda didn't do the insider trading.
[01:42:34.802 --> 01:42:39.044]  Al-Qaeda didn't call mayors and congressmen up and tell them not to fly that next day to New York.
[01:42:40.165 --> 01:42:42.326]  Al-Qaeda didn't call the Joint Chiefs up and tell them that.
[01:42:42.686 --> 01:42:47.368]  Al-Qaeda didn't run war games of flying hijacked jets at the exact same targets at the exact same time.
[01:42:49.767 --> 01:42:52.631]  But no, the left comes out and says, Al-Qaeda's striking back.
[01:42:52.972 --> 01:42:56.156]  Oh look, the poor downtrodden Muslims are striking back in London.
[01:42:56.497 --> 01:42:58.820]  You guys are part of the same controlled paradigm.
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:00.723]  And that's why we may lose!
[01:43:01.223 --> 01:43:02.866]  Because you're presented with the facts.
[01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:08.771]  You're presented with the information, and with our information, we have the documents, the admissions, and everything makes sense.
[01:43:09.271 --> 01:43:11.032]  Your stuff doesn't make sense.
[01:43:11.772 --> 01:43:13.652]  Our government gave them the Panama Canal.
[01:43:14.112 --> 01:43:15.773]  Our government gave them the supercomputers.
[01:43:16.213 --> 01:43:18.373]  Our government gave them the uranium.
[01:43:18.713 --> 01:43:22.814]  Our government gave them the technology, the miniaturization technology for the MERS.
[01:43:24.654 --> 01:43:26.415]  And that's all our government.
[01:43:26.475 --> 01:43:28.835]  Rumsfeld, the same one that gave you aspartame.
[01:43:29.235 --> 01:43:30.516]  He's the one that gave them the reactors.
[01:43:35.808 --> 01:43:37.889]  No, you're still in a fake left-right paradigm.
[01:43:38.089 --> 01:43:45.472]  Just like all those idiots that listen to Rush Limbaugh, where all day it's how the evil Democrats are going to get us, when George Bush is out Clinton and Clinton!
[01:43:48.533 --> 01:44:03.159]  You guys are all neutralized, frozen in a fake political spectrum, all going through these simulations they've given you, and then your political action has no effect and no power, and simply strengthens the false spectrum of data that we've been given.
[01:44:05.143 --> 01:44:05.723]  Let me tell you something.
[01:44:05.763 --> 01:44:29.137]  If you don't wake up, if you don't stick your head in a bucket of ice water, slap yourself upside the face until you're blue in the face, if you don't go out and I don't know what you've got to do, jump in a pool of ice water and get your head out of the sand, buddy, and stop thinking you've got it all figured out with all these controlled Ford Foundation twits, these phony left twits, these Noam Chomsky twits, it's over!
[01:44:32.839 --> 01:44:33.179]  All right?
[01:44:33.843 --> 01:44:35.943]  I'll let this Texan tell you like it is.
[01:44:39.344 --> 01:44:40.244]  We're in deep trouble.
[01:44:43.325 --> 01:44:46.586]  You know, I've got all the bombing news, and I've got all the other stuff, but just look at this.
[01:44:46.906 --> 01:44:48.466]  United Nations calls for U.S.
[01:44:48.526 --> 01:44:49.226]  net pullout.
[01:44:49.766 --> 01:44:50.106]  The U.N.
[01:44:50.126 --> 01:44:51.247]  is about to take over the net.
[01:44:51.787 --> 01:44:53.607]  This is the Associated Press, U.K.
[01:44:53.647 --> 01:44:55.267]  Inquirer, UPI.
[01:44:56.368 --> 01:44:56.988]  And the U.N.
[01:44:57.028 --> 01:45:01.108]  says they're openly going to start registering and controlling free speech and taking over our websites.
[01:45:02.949 --> 01:45:03.349]  And it's all...
[01:45:04.594 --> 01:45:26.428]  Harvard professor investigated in a fluoride research flap, Associated Press, his own graduate students have gone public and said that he falsified and covered up the fact that it did prove, in a major study from 1992 to 1999, a massive study, that fluoride conclusively causes, it was just a test of male children, massive increases in leukemia.
[01:45:26.809 --> 01:45:28.910]  That's just the cancer they tested for.
[01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:31.592]  There's a whole bunch of other studies by other governments.
[01:45:33.141 --> 01:45:35.982]  Okay, there's your loving government.
[01:45:36.022 --> 01:45:37.063]  And then here's another one today.
[01:45:37.103 --> 01:45:40.525]  This is the type of stuff we never get to because we're so busy talking about the controlled terror paradigm.
[01:45:41.005 --> 01:45:41.985]  This is the BBC.
[01:45:42.125 --> 01:45:43.786]  Sweetener linked to leukemias.
[01:45:45.547 --> 01:45:46.067]  Another one.
[01:45:47.028 --> 01:45:58.273]  Man, everything's linked to leukemia, bone cancer with the fluoride, leukemia with the aspartame.
[01:45:58.373 --> 01:46:00.514]  Of course, what alcohol causes leukemia?
[01:46:02.082 --> 01:46:03.502]  Sweetener linked to leukemia.
[01:46:04.623 --> 01:46:05.283]  And it goes on.
[01:46:05.323 --> 01:46:15.206]  The study, Dr. Morfado Sorfetti and colleagues at the Cancer Research Center in Bologna fed eight-week-old rats varying concentrations of aspartame-laced food.
[01:46:15.566 --> 01:46:24.068]  Compared with controlled rats given no sweetener, many of the female rats of the experiment developed lymphomas or leukemias, the risk increasing with the dose of aspartame.
[01:46:24.408 --> 01:46:25.149]  So you go ahead.
[01:46:25.209 --> 01:46:27.369]  Notice all the special children's drinks.
[01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:29.890]  We'll see fluoride fortified and...
[01:46:31.383 --> 01:46:32.984]  Aspartame fortified.
[01:46:33.044 --> 01:46:35.105]  Drink your Pedialyte.
[01:46:35.666 --> 01:46:45.532]  The researchers said their study raises concerns about the levels of aspartame to which humans can be exposed and therefore urgent re-examination of aspartame safety is needed especially to protect children.
[01:46:46.633 --> 01:46:53.677]  The existing European Food Safety Authority assessment for aspartame led to the setting of an acceptable daily intake.
[01:46:55.248 --> 01:47:05.432]  And for all the government bureaucrats that think you're part of the government and think that because you're good, the government must be good, you just go ahead and you buy that aspartame food and you just give it to your child.
[01:47:05.672 --> 01:47:06.933]  You just don't listen to me.
[01:47:06.953 --> 01:47:08.893]  Don't listen to a word I say.
[01:47:08.913 --> 01:47:12.395]  You just go ahead and hurt your children, you scumbags.
[01:47:12.975 --> 01:47:14.656]  All of you listening, you scum.
[01:47:14.996 --> 01:47:17.177]  Don't take the time to read the back of the package.
[01:47:17.497 --> 01:47:18.737]  Don't buy organic food.
[01:47:18.797 --> 01:47:20.158]  Just murder your children.
[01:47:20.758 --> 01:47:35.889]  And when you're sitting there at the hospital, and they take a breath, wait six seconds, an hour before they're, Mommy, Mommy, you just remember that you bought into the evil, and you didn't face the horror, so you lost your family members!
[01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:38.070]  I'm so sick of the evil.
[01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:40.951]  The sodium fluoride in the water, all the things.
[01:47:41.031 --> 01:47:42.051]  It does to us!
[01:47:42.331 --> 01:47:43.351]  What's wrong with us?
[01:47:43.391 --> 01:47:44.331]  What's happened to us?
[01:47:44.511 --> 01:47:55.893]  We've got a bunch of psychopathic Nazi eugenicists running everything, poisoning the living daylights out of us, gearing up for nuclear war, selling out our sovereignty, destroying this country.
[01:47:56.854 --> 01:48:00.334]  And you idiots out there, so weak-minded you don't face the truth.
[01:48:04.235 --> 01:48:05.195]  I'm so sick of it.
[01:48:06.570 --> 01:48:10.031]  You know what it's like to just know the truth and know how evil the elite is?
[01:48:10.691 --> 01:48:12.452]  And they put out their own publications.
[01:48:13.272 --> 01:48:22.654]  Their own, they sell them in bookstores written by kings and queens where they talk about how they want to kill you and we catch them doing it and you still trust them.
[01:48:25.575 --> 01:48:26.755]  What is wrong with us?
[01:48:27.495 --> 01:48:28.996]  This makes me so angry.
[01:48:31.676 --> 01:48:34.357]  Makes me so, so angry.
[01:48:36.101 --> 01:48:37.882]  How can they hurt the little ones?
[01:48:38.362 --> 01:48:40.063]  These people are inhuman!
[01:48:41.103 --> 01:48:43.784]  But they revel in it that they don't care, that they enjoy it.
[01:48:44.144 --> 01:48:45.705]  They revel in their ruthlessness.
[01:48:45.965 --> 01:48:47.405]  They love being evil.
[01:48:53.188 --> 01:48:54.948]  I mean, it's just so sick.
[01:48:56.469 --> 01:48:57.469]  It's so horrible.
[01:48:57.529 --> 01:48:58.210]  And here it is.
[01:48:58.230 --> 01:49:01.071]  Harvard University is investigating an allegation that...
[01:49:01.767 --> 01:49:06.812]  Professor downplayed research showing an increased risk of bone cancer for boys who drink fluorinated tap water.
[01:49:08.013 --> 01:49:09.414]  It also causes a bunch of other cancers.
[01:49:10.014 --> 01:49:15.579]  Chester Douglas, who heads up Harvard's Department of Oral Health Policy and Epidemiology, received a $1.3 billion grant.
[01:49:15.940 --> 01:49:20.884]  And I, too, from the National Institute of Environmental Health and Science, to conduct a study of fluoride exposure in...
[01:49:22.325 --> 01:49:24.846]  Osteosarcoma, a rare form of bone cancer.
[01:49:24.947 --> 01:49:35.012]  Douglas, a 9299 study found that the odds of having it goes on, and his own graduate students say he falsified it, and that the evidence showed massive increases in the rare bone cancer.
[01:49:35.052 --> 01:49:44.037]  We've got a Nobel laureate going public saying it causes leukemias, it causes a bunch of other forms of cancer, bone cancer.
[01:49:44.137 --> 01:49:44.957]  Just don't believe it.
[01:49:45.298 --> 01:49:46.138]  Just drink it.
[01:49:46.938 --> 01:49:48.019]  Just guzzle it.
[01:49:48.059 --> 01:49:49.580]  Just give it to your babies then.
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:50.420]  Fine!
[01:49:50.480 --> 01:49:51.201]  Don't listen to me!
[01:49:54.890 --> 01:49:55.330]  We're good to go.
[01:50:15.115 --> 01:50:21.778]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.978 --> 01:50:26.379]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.619 --> 01:50:33.842]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:51:15.675 --> 01:51:22.178]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.339 --> 01:51:27.441]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.561 --> 01:51:36.445]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.685 --> 01:51:41.548]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888

[01:51:54.068 --> 01:51:56.889]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:51:56.989 --> 01:52:02.071]  We all eat sugars, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:52:02.291 --> 01:52:08.453]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:52:08.733 --> 01:52:14.395]  That's why a Garicus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:52:14.635 --> 01:52:20.136]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and a Garicus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:52:20.397 --> 01:52:21.917]  That's why it's become the most popular immune
[01:52:22.237 --> 01:52:29.522]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[01:52:29.702 --> 01:52:30.522]  Call 877-817-9829.

[01:52:49.153 --> 01:52:51.475]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[01:52:54.749 --> 01:52:59.912]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.572 --> 01:53:02.954]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:02.974 --> 01:53:05.055]  Let me ask you a question.
[01:53:05.115 --> 01:53:15.441]  How are you supposed to act when you know that over 9,000 foods, and that was years ago, I've been told it's even more because the patent ran out on aspartame.
[01:53:16.481 --> 01:53:19.363]  And so now it is in thousands and thousands of foods.
[01:53:20.524 --> 01:53:22.565]  And it is, I mean, folks, it is deadly.
[01:53:23.966 --> 01:53:33.937]  And all the, I mean, studies from the 1930s at UT about how fluoride is a toxic sedative and causes all these cancers, I mean, they knew it back then.
[01:53:35.859 --> 01:53:39.563]  And I just, I've got Henry Kissinger's own document.
[01:53:39.583 --> 01:53:42.867]  It was declassified in 92, where in 73 he ordered...
[01:53:45.399 --> 01:53:56.929]  The IMF through the CIA, where they get their main funding out of our government, to tell the five most populous countries to forcibly sterilize half their women or they wouldn't get the money.
[01:53:58.010 --> 01:54:03.754]  Imagine they came and they grabbed millions of people and cut their tubes, cut their organs out.
[01:54:03.794 --> 01:54:05.195]  I mean, that's admitted.
[01:54:06.076 --> 01:54:10.400]  Folks, you yell and scream about a football game, but I'm bad because I'm upset?
[01:54:12.208 --> 01:54:41.516]  If you look at how the cancers are like doubling every 10 years, and all these different childhood diseases, and childhood cancers, and childhood, you know, the problems with sugar regulation, the diabetes, I mean, it's just, and the sperm count down by 80 plus percent, and then all the studies done all over the world show how deadly it all is, and we're supposed to just slurp it into, oh, my government wouldn't do that to me.
[01:54:42.563 --> 01:54:56.286]  And I have, like, you know, the father of DNA splicing on from England, and he goes, oh, yes, our study's found, and he was a pro-genetics engineering, shows that when you genetically engineer one gene, say, in a potato, the body can't absorb it.
[01:54:56.326 --> 01:55:01.267]  It creates a new amino acid, and it's very toxic and kills the rats.
[01:55:01.527 --> 01:55:04.528]  And then I find out it's all over the store shelves, and we're eating it.
[01:55:04.608 --> 01:55:07.649]  I mean, you know, how dare, I mean, folks, folks.
[01:55:08.519 --> 01:55:09.880]  I mean, this is real.
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:11.341]  I wish it wasn't real.
[01:55:11.661 --> 01:55:12.922]  I wish it wasn't true.
[01:55:13.182 --> 01:55:17.605]  I wish that the British government hadn't been caught blowing up buses and trains before.
[01:55:18.045 --> 01:55:19.886]  And then all the evidence shows they did this one.
[01:55:20.146 --> 01:55:21.907]  And I've got to watch them frame these patsies.
[01:55:22.128 --> 01:55:25.590]  And the government's got handbooks on how to frame patsies that are declassified.
[01:55:27.231 --> 01:55:30.513]  I mean, it's so sick to see our borders wide open.
[01:55:31.033 --> 01:55:33.495]  And to see all of our freedoms being destroyed.
[01:55:33.655 --> 01:55:35.596]  And I love America.
[01:55:36.480 --> 01:55:37.341]  I've got a family.
[01:55:37.361 --> 01:55:38.502]  A lot of you got a family.
[01:55:39.082 --> 01:55:43.687]  But the police and the military and everybody listening, you know in your guts I'm telling you the truth.
[01:55:43.707 --> 01:55:47.170]  You've already heard and read much of what I said, but you never put it all together.
[01:55:47.810 --> 01:55:49.492]  In the name of Jesus, wake up.
[01:55:49.612 --> 01:55:51.373]  I ask God moves you to wake up.
[01:55:51.874 --> 01:55:53.355]  This is so evil.
[01:55:55.097 --> 01:55:57.199]  There's so much evil all around us.
[01:55:58.059 --> 01:56:00.622]  And the times are coming when things are going to get much worse.
[01:56:01.423 --> 01:56:05.105]  I'll get into the Madrid... I'm saying Madrid because it's connected.
[01:56:05.145 --> 01:56:12.388]  The latest developments with the one in bombing and a bunch of police state news and a bunch of other stuff, and we'll take your calls in the third hour.
[01:56:12.428 --> 01:56:13.428]  I'm just very upset.
[01:56:13.448 --> 01:56:17.590]  I mean, it really comes home to me how serious all this is.
[01:56:17.610 --> 01:56:21.472]  It's just... So many people are naive.
[01:56:21.492 --> 01:56:26.714]  You think the world is like you are because you wouldn't think about killing your grandma for a stick of bubble gum.
[01:56:27.134 --> 01:56:28.615]  You think globalists wouldn't.
[01:56:29.989 --> 01:56:33.311]  They are a secret society, a clan of psychopaths.
[01:56:34.551 --> 01:56:38.073]  And they revel in being the most ruthless, the kings of the criminals.
[01:56:39.514 --> 01:56:44.876]  And, you know, we could stop this if you'll just stand up and get involved.
[01:56:44.896 --> 01:56:47.197]  I pray to God you do.
[01:56:48.798 --> 01:56:49.078]  I don't know.
[01:56:49.098 --> 01:56:49.679]  I'm so angry.
[01:56:49.699 --> 01:56:51.079]  I may just go to rebroadcast.
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:56:53.621]  It really comes down to me how sick this is.
[01:56:53.641 --> 01:56:54.821]  It just makes me sick.
[01:56:55.281 --> 01:56:56.342]  I feel horrible right now.
[01:56:57.822 --> 01:57:00.644]  I let my defenses down psychologically, and I really face the horror.
[01:57:01.044 --> 01:57:03.266]  And when the dam breaks like this, I've been holding it back.
[01:57:03.346 --> 01:57:05.388]  It just really freaks me out.
[01:57:06.388 --> 01:57:08.770]  How could they knowingly kill children?
[01:57:09.130 --> 01:57:09.671]  God!
[01:57:10.591 --> 01:57:12.012]  God, help us!
[01:57:13.233 --> 01:57:16.035]  And you people don't realize how evil they are!
[01:57:16.876 --> 01:57:17.856]  None of us are safe!
[01:57:17.937 --> 01:57:19.237]  Our children aren't safe!
[01:57:21.959 --> 01:57:22.360]  Oh, God.
[01:57:22.380 --> 01:57:23.360]  Ugh!
[01:57:23.841 --> 01:57:23.901]  Ugh!
[01:57:26.522 --> 01:57:27.583]  We gotta get real.
[01:57:28.564 --> 01:57:31.006]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:31.026 --> 01:57:31.846]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.278 --> 01:57:52.319]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.040 --> 01:57:54.141]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.782 --> 01:57:55.643]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.363 --> 01:57:57.224]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.925 --> 01:58:01.609]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.129 --> 01:58:06.274]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.014 --> 01:58:13.401]  You know, I normally try to be hard and just scientifically, coldly face what we're dealing with.
[01:58:15.043 --> 01:58:18.445]  So many people hear me interrupt guests and callers and think I'm trying to show off.
[01:58:18.505 --> 01:58:23.709]  No, I just get some thought, what I believe is an insight, and just want to impart it to people.
[01:58:25.270 --> 01:58:25.870]  I'm frantic.
[01:58:26.150 --> 01:58:27.111]  I mean, let's just face it.
[01:58:28.492 --> 01:58:30.854]  And I've studied the facts.
[01:58:30.874 --> 01:58:31.834]  I know what we're dealing with.
[01:58:31.874 --> 01:58:34.036]  I've read the globalist's own comments and their own statements.
[01:58:35.677 --> 01:58:39.579]  And, you know, my heart is soft deep down, and I'm a very loving person.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:43.342]  And people that are also very loving are also very aggressive and violent.
[01:58:44.642 --> 01:58:59.015]  And, you know, when I was younger and couldn't control it, you know, well, that's how aggressive alpha mammals are, is that you see the species of the more aggressive mammals, say the canine, the wolf, and it's also, you know, very loving within its own pack.
[01:58:59.562 --> 01:59:04.324]  That's engineered into us by God so we don't hurt ourselves and our families.
[01:59:04.404 --> 01:59:10.086]  But then at the same time, that means you also have a very large soft spot if you are a tough guy and pretty aggressive.
[01:59:10.106 --> 01:59:11.107]  And I'm not tooting my horn.
[01:59:11.127 --> 01:59:12.027]  I'm not even proud of that.
[01:59:12.067 --> 01:59:14.088]  But I am a pretty aggressive person.
[01:59:14.128 --> 01:59:15.909]  I mean, let's be quite frank about it.
[01:59:16.949 --> 01:59:22.772]  And so I just read about them openly knowing that sodium fluoride is killing us.
[01:59:24.648 --> 01:59:26.109]  It's deadly, okay?
[01:59:26.149 --> 01:59:27.170]  It's not like it's bad for you.
[01:59:27.190 --> 01:59:27.871]  I mean, it's deadly.
[01:59:28.351 --> 01:59:31.174]  How about how they know that aspartame is caused with leukemias?
[01:59:32.415 --> 01:59:33.236]  Conclusively.
[01:59:34.737 --> 01:59:35.798]  These little children.
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:44.446]  And then I read two years ago when they released Dan Burton's committee because his grandson got brain damage from it.
[01:59:44.486 --> 01:59:48.910]  He sent in investigators with a congressional order and got the documents before they could block them all out.
[01:59:50.225 --> 01:59:54.226]  Where the CDC top people met and top scientists said, yeah, millions have been brain damaged.
[01:59:54.766 --> 01:59:57.727]  We've got to cover this up, but certainly we shouldn't give it to our families.
[01:59:58.487 --> 02:00:01.568]  I mean, there was one in 25,000 22 years ago that had autism.
[02:00:01.588 --> 02:00:01.728]  It's 168.
[02:00:01.768 --> 02:00:02.248]  One in 168 now.
[02:00:02.268 --> 02:00:04.649]  There's autistic children being warehoused in every public school.
[02:00:11.079 --> 02:00:29.185]  They take people who would have had lives and wives and husbands and children and whole family lines and scientists who would have created incredible things and people who would have been powerful preachers and powerful artists and people who would have loved and enjoyed and had such great lives and they stole it from them.
[02:00:29.585 --> 02:00:35.727]  These bastards who hate life and hate love and hate God stole it from them!
[02:00:37.186 --> 02:00:47.414]  And we're a decadent evil society who's so cowardly, we make split-second decisions to deny the truth of what our souls, of what our discernment knows.
[02:00:48.014 --> 02:00:53.879]  And then we look at the evidence, the cold hard facts, it's so horrible I can't even believe it!
[02:00:57.261 --> 02:01:02.045]  How do you knowingly brain damage, and many die, children die,
[02:01:03.504 --> 02:01:05.746]  How do you knowingly do all of this?
[02:01:05.806 --> 02:01:06.987]  They revel in it.
[02:01:08.028 --> 02:01:09.048]  But let me tell you something.
[02:01:09.088 --> 02:01:10.089]  There is a hell.
[02:01:10.710 --> 02:01:13.091]  And the New World Order is going to hell.
[02:01:14.432 --> 02:01:16.454]  You are going to hell.
[02:01:17.135 --> 02:01:20.037]  And God is going to judge you while you're still alive.
[02:01:20.137 --> 02:01:22.419]  I ask God to bring judgment on these people.
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.741]  To bring us justice.
[02:01:25.841 --> 02:01:27.643]  God, bring us justice!
[02:01:29.511 --> 02:01:37.077]  And God says, you've got to stand up and do the right thing, and you've got to sacrifice yourself, and then I'll bring you justice.
[02:01:37.357 --> 02:01:38.698]  That's what God tells me.
[02:01:39.579 --> 02:01:49.547]  So when you stand up with courage, and when you stand up and admit the truth, and when you admit to God that you're scum, and that you've been evil, then He'll turn things around for this country.
[02:01:49.727 --> 02:01:53.030]  But until we do that, it's just going to get worse.
[02:01:54.551 --> 02:01:56.472]  Do you understand how real this is?
[02:01:56.492 --> 02:01:57.412]  This is real!
[02:01:57.772 --> 02:01:59.013]  This is all real!
[02:01:59.353 --> 02:02:00.673]  I hope you've got that out there!
[02:02:00.693 --> 02:02:01.854]  I hope you understand that!
[02:02:01.994 --> 02:02:03.534]  Every single one of you listening!
[02:02:03.774 --> 02:02:09.276]  Especially government bureaucrats and yuppies and people that serve this system and think they're part of the power structure!
[02:02:09.436 --> 02:02:10.177]  You're not!
[02:02:11.517 --> 02:02:12.698]  And you're in deep trouble!
[02:02:12.878 --> 02:02:14.578]  And you're in grave danger!
[02:02:14.838 --> 02:02:19.120]  And it's time for you to listen to me and understand what we're facing!
[02:02:20.464 --> 02:02:22.204]  This is the survival of the species.
[02:02:22.384 --> 02:02:23.425]  We're being mutated.
[02:02:23.545 --> 02:02:30.746]  We're being twisted by the Dark Lord and the New World Order and his henchmen, his horsemen, are coming.
[02:02:30.906 --> 02:02:32.287]  You can hear the hooves.
[02:02:32.447 --> 02:02:34.067]  You can see the dust cloud.
[02:02:34.347 --> 02:02:35.627]  I'm on the watchtower.
[02:02:35.848 --> 02:02:37.908]  I'm looking into the devil's eyes.
[02:02:38.648 --> 02:02:42.189]  Rise up and resist in the name of Jesus Christ!
[02:02:45.436 --> 02:02:49.779]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.959 --> 02:02:54.401]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.521 --> 02:02:58.904]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.944 --> 02:03:00.305]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.076 --> 02:03:06.298]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.358 --> 02:03:13.301]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.421 --> 02:03:15.482]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.802 --> 02:03:26.246]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.426 --> 02:03:30.748]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3,
[02:03:30.948 --> 02:03:31.008]  888-253-3139.

[02:03:48.012 --> 02:03:48.772]  We're good to go.
[02:04:12.979 --> 02:04:13.479]  We're good to go.
[02:04:42.739 --> 02:04:43.199]  We're good to go.
[02:04:43.239 --> 02:04:45.800]  We're good to go.
[02:04:45.840 --> 02:04:46.421]  We're good to go.

[02:05:49.068 --> 02:05:51.909]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.009 --> 02:05:56.431]  All right, I got a bunch of audio clips I haven't played in the last few days concerning the...
[02:05:57.672 --> 02:05:59.973]  One's from Comedy Central with the London bombing and others.
[02:06:00.533 --> 02:06:02.914]  Police finally getting in trouble for overusing tasers.
[02:06:03.755 --> 02:06:06.136]  Another just documents the police state.
[02:06:06.156 --> 02:06:06.896]  It's a cartoon.
[02:06:07.336 --> 02:06:10.178]  It's not as funny without the images, but it's on prisonplanet.com.
[02:06:11.858 --> 02:06:18.081]  There's a bunch of news I haven't gotten to, but I just get really upset when they knowingly put aspartame in the food to hurt us as a chemical weapon.
[02:06:18.121 --> 02:06:18.901]  Rumsfeld did that.
[02:06:19.282 --> 02:06:21.082]  When they put fluoride in to hurt us.
[02:06:21.903 --> 02:06:22.883]  All the studies are out.
[02:06:22.943 --> 02:06:26.885]  Oh, but you're a kook if you talk about it, because Dr. Strangelove said so, you know, in the Stanley Kubrick movie.
[02:06:27.879 --> 02:06:32.420]  I mean, folks, you always pay a price for ignoring evil, and it's just out of control.
[02:06:33.800 --> 02:06:36.981]  And we're all in danger, and I'm just angry about it.
[02:06:37.061 --> 02:06:38.601]  I mean, this is a normal response.
[02:06:38.621 --> 02:06:44.343]  You should get up on your hind end, you know, up on your back legs like a grizzly bear, and defend your family in this country.
[02:06:46.083 --> 02:06:51.905]  Let's go to Tim in Wisconsin and Ken, Ron, and a bunch of other people, David and others.
[02:06:51.945 --> 02:06:52.525]  Go ahead, Tim.
[02:06:54.489 --> 02:07:00.933]  One group that I can't help having to say thumbs up to are the eight Christians that go to D.C.
[02:07:00.973 --> 02:07:05.475]  and peacefully protest against abortion.
[02:07:07.156 --> 02:07:08.076]  The eight Christians?
[02:07:08.257 --> 02:07:11.198]  Don't they have millions that protest in Washington?
[02:07:11.218 --> 02:07:14.160]  I don't know.
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:17.361]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:07:17.682 --> 02:07:18.282]  I appreciate it.
[02:07:19.436 --> 02:07:21.477]  Ken, Ken in Canada.
[02:07:21.517 --> 02:07:22.258]  Go ahead, Ken.
[02:07:22.598 --> 02:07:23.299]  Alex, how you doing?
[02:07:23.319 --> 02:07:24.759]  I appreciate the fight you fight, man.
[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:30.042]  I wanted to call in and make a point about this guy that said about the 10 million people in Washington.
[02:07:30.603 --> 02:07:33.104]  I think he had more the idea of a peaceful march, man.
[02:07:33.144 --> 02:07:34.505]  You're the guy who could call it.
[02:07:34.905 --> 02:07:38.387]  You're the guy that can make a difference, Alex, and I think you should really embrace that.
[02:07:38.407 --> 02:07:42.409]  Another quick thing about these cops, shot the 19-month-old baby.
[02:07:43.190 --> 02:07:44.931]  Rotten pig should be dragged in the street.
[02:07:46.248 --> 02:07:53.790]  They do that kind of stuff on TV and let people know that it happens to let you know when they want you, they'll come and get you, and they'll kill your children as well.
[02:07:54.450 --> 02:07:55.551]  And do me a favor, bro.
[02:07:55.911 --> 02:07:56.971]  Take a vacation.
[02:07:57.131 --> 02:07:57.791]  You need one.
[02:07:57.871 --> 02:07:59.092]  It'll do us all a favor.
[02:07:59.192 --> 02:07:59.832]  Take care of us.
[02:07:59.972 --> 02:08:01.512]  I appreciate everything you do, man.
[02:08:01.572 --> 02:08:02.393]  All right, Ken.
[02:08:02.453 --> 02:08:03.213]  I appreciate it.
[02:08:03.233 --> 02:08:05.954]  I think that's in the works.
[02:08:08.294 --> 02:08:13.776]  You know, I want to believe the SWAT team that blew this 19-month-old baby's head off.
[02:08:15.020 --> 02:08:18.522]  That they're all depressed and in counseling and some of them want to leave the force now?
[02:08:18.542 --> 02:08:25.146]  I mean, I believe that to a certain extent because we've interviewed master sergeants who've shot kids and then break down.
[02:08:25.186 --> 02:08:26.547]  I mean, it's your programming, folks.
[02:08:27.488 --> 02:08:29.089]  You're supposed to break down when you kill children.
[02:08:29.109 --> 02:08:31.290]  It's supposed to make you sick forever.
[02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:37.114]  You know, and I get sick just knowing they're poisoning children with vaccines and fluoride and aspartame.
[02:08:37.334 --> 02:08:39.855]  I was just reading major studies, BBC, AP.
[02:08:41.777 --> 02:08:42.357]  Made me sick.
[02:08:44.207 --> 02:08:49.051]  And it does sound like, if we can believe their story, because, I mean, these SWAT teams lie so much, folks.
[02:08:49.071 --> 02:08:50.532]  Lie-ifying, you know.
[02:08:50.552 --> 02:08:51.653]  I mean, they get together and they lie.
[02:08:52.253 --> 02:08:54.275]  That I don't know if I can believe them, but I want to believe them.
[02:08:54.295 --> 02:09:01.120]  That the real scumbag was this father using the baby as a shield.
[02:09:02.962 --> 02:09:05.884]  But where the cops went wrong is when he fired to the wall on them.
[02:09:07.085 --> 02:09:07.925]  They should have known.
[02:09:07.965 --> 02:09:08.886]  They signed on.
[02:09:08.926 --> 02:09:09.527]  They're men.
[02:09:09.587 --> 02:09:11.088]  They get hazard pay.
[02:09:11.940 --> 02:09:15.041]  Because they signed up for this, and that baby doesn't deserve it.
[02:09:15.061 --> 02:09:21.462]  They should have taken those shots and retreated and negotiated and done whatever they had to to get that baby out of there.
[02:09:24.823 --> 02:09:28.044]  But these are pretty, not all of them, but a lot of them are pretty cowardly, folks.
[02:09:28.084 --> 02:09:30.765]  It's like sitting outside for four hours, 15 minutes at Columbine.
[02:09:33.705 --> 02:09:37.526]  It's, I mean, what else do you call that but cowardly?
[02:09:39.267 --> 02:09:40.867]  And, but, you know,
[02:09:41.997 --> 02:09:46.480]  Obviously, if their story's true, the father is much worse than the police.
[02:09:47.021 --> 02:09:52.445]  Some bloated drug addict using a baby as a shield.
[02:09:52.505 --> 02:09:55.887]  I mean, that person, if that's true, is in hell right now.
[02:09:55.947 --> 02:09:56.768]  You can guarantee it.
[02:09:56.828 --> 02:09:59.970]  I mean, I would jump in a meat grinder right now for my children.
[02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:03.733]  I'd jump in front of a bus, no thought, no... I'd probably jump in front of a bus for your kids.
[02:10:03.753 --> 02:10:04.994]  That's just what men are supposed to do.
[02:10:05.014 --> 02:10:08.096]  I don't even have a choice about it.
[02:10:08.116 --> 02:10:09.357]  I'm like programmed this way.
[02:10:11.451 --> 02:10:12.451]  I'm not castrated.
[02:10:13.651 --> 02:10:18.752]  And our forefathers would just stand up and die in a minute.
[02:10:18.872 --> 02:10:20.693]  Oh, 8,000 Mexican soldiers are coming to kill.
[02:10:20.713 --> 02:10:21.773]  There's 183 of us.
[02:10:21.813 --> 02:10:22.973]  Well, let's just die then.
[02:10:23.653 --> 02:10:25.194]  I'm not as manly as those people.
[02:10:25.994 --> 02:10:27.534]  I'm a lot more than some people.
[02:10:29.414 --> 02:10:31.755]  So the guy shoots through the door and shoots one of your cops.
[02:10:31.955 --> 02:10:33.775]  So you freak out and start spraying bullets.
[02:10:34.215 --> 02:10:36.576]  And you knew he had a baby because he retreated with a baby in there.
[02:10:37.056 --> 02:10:38.176]  That is disgusting!
[02:10:39.668 --> 02:10:40.748]  You take the bullet.
[02:10:41.128 --> 02:10:42.669]  You don't shoot the baby.
[02:10:43.669 --> 02:10:45.169]  That's why you're on a SWAT team.
[02:10:45.310 --> 02:10:47.170]  That's why you're a big, tough man.
[02:10:47.370 --> 02:10:48.610]  That's why you go to the gym.
[02:10:49.171 --> 02:10:50.231]  That's why you do all this, you know.
[02:10:50.351 --> 02:10:51.251]  You're into being tough.
[02:10:51.291 --> 02:10:52.571]  Well, that's what it is to be tough.
[02:10:52.992 --> 02:10:57.133]  A tough is laying your life down for those that are weaker than you, those that need your help.
[02:10:58.473 --> 02:11:02.414]  Tough isn't let's kill him and blowing the baby's head off.
[02:11:04.443 --> 02:11:05.004]  And you know what?
[02:11:05.024 --> 02:11:06.445]  You're going to wish you would have retreated.
[02:11:06.465 --> 02:11:11.710]  You're going to wish you would have taken those bullets because your lives are effectively probably going to be ruined.
[02:11:16.774 --> 02:11:17.515]  It's ridiculous.
[02:11:20.117 --> 02:11:23.720]  As soon as the guy had the baby in his arms saying, I'm going to use it as a shield, they should have retreated.
[02:11:24.441 --> 02:11:28.945]  By the way, that's just basic hostage rescue handbook.
[02:11:29.005 --> 02:11:29.826]  I mean, I'm not...
[02:11:30.436 --> 02:11:33.198]  I was at one or two courses in criminology in college, but I know that.
[02:11:33.458 --> 02:11:34.358]  Just from reading books.
[02:11:34.378 --> 02:11:40.302]  I mean, you guys want this job, then you better learn how to carry it out, because you're going to be responsible.
[02:11:45.025 --> 02:11:47.746]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[02:11:47.826 --> 02:11:48.447]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:11:48.467 --> 02:11:49.427]  Hi, Alex.
[02:11:50.148 --> 02:11:52.769]  Alex, another piece of information.
[02:11:52.789 --> 02:11:57.212]  They have just put online in the city of New York something called the Real-Time Crime Center.
[02:11:58.096 --> 02:12:02.098]  You can read about it if you like to check out New York Newsday or the New York Sun.
[02:12:02.898 --> 02:12:11.002]  What they've done, and they pulled a bit of a fast one here, is they said that they wanted to get basically a center sort of similar to the National Defense Center.
[02:12:11.502 --> 02:12:12.623]  It looks like that, literally.
[02:12:12.643 --> 02:12:13.743]  It's in our police headquarters.
[02:12:14.263 --> 02:12:19.966]  And initially they said they were going to compile their complete police records, you know, crime complaints and so forth.
[02:12:19.986 --> 02:12:21.727]  This is federally funded six months ago.
[02:12:21.747 --> 02:12:24.768]  They're going to gather private data and be an integration hub.
[02:12:24.888 --> 02:12:25.388]  You got it.
[02:12:25.428 --> 02:12:26.649]  A vacuum for the feds.
[02:12:26.949 --> 02:12:27.329]  Right, right.
[02:12:27.409 --> 02:12:34.114]  It went from just pulling their records together, to which even a man like myself will say, okay, if they want to pull their records together, that's okay.
[02:12:34.134 --> 02:12:34.814]  What am I going to say?
[02:12:34.854 --> 02:12:36.395]  Police can't put their own reports together?
[02:12:36.896 --> 02:12:45.522]  But now we find out that the larger portion of information in the system is culled from non-police reports, non-criminal documentation.
[02:12:46.262 --> 02:12:50.505]  Now, why would they want to cull information about people
[02:12:51.295 --> 02:12:59.020]  Non-criminal information about people who may have never even had the slightest... Well, I don't know if you knew this, Ron, but they announced six months ago, from Dallas to Chicago, from L.A.
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:12.229]  to New York to Miami to Timbuktu, Canada, England, New Zealand, the extra-long countries, the five countries, they are all going to take... Did you see two years ago the headline in the USA Today?
[02:13:13.343 --> 02:13:18.547]  Now, what we have here is a situation... Now, here's the philosophy they're operating on, and this is the dangerous philosophy.
[02:13:40.231 --> 02:13:41.373]  Well, it's simple.
[02:13:41.393 --> 02:13:46.380]  You type in Alex E. Jones and my number, and it tells you the last purchase I made where.
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:51.167]  And now you notice we're going stores now, trying to pay cash for stuff that, you know, anything.
[02:13:51.508 --> 02:13:52.569]  It's like, oh, can I see your ID?
[02:13:52.609 --> 02:13:53.410]  Well, we just got it.
[02:13:53.470 --> 02:13:54.011]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:13:54.211 --> 02:13:55.113]  Let me make this point.
[02:13:55.979 --> 02:13:59.321]  The larger portion of their records are culled from non-criminal data.
[02:13:59.701 --> 02:14:06.625]  The larger portion of their records would be upon people who have never had the slightest contact with the criminal justice or police system.
[02:14:06.745 --> 02:14:24.134]  Yeah, instead they should be profiling, let me stop you, they should be profiling at the border, if they're really worried about terrorists, profiling key strata of society, and then they would actually, but now they're going to have an overflow of evidence, which can just be database for other reasons, and it will actually hurt anti-terror activities.
[02:14:24.434 --> 02:14:24.934]  Well, sure.
[02:14:25.114 --> 02:14:28.497]  Everything at the NSA is about filters known as profiling.
[02:14:28.977 --> 02:14:32.559]  Right, and unfortunately that's not the case here, so I think they've got other motives.
[02:14:32.579 --> 02:14:34.481]  But what I'm trying to say... You think they do?
[02:14:34.501 --> 02:14:36.942]  They've said it's going to be for the cashless society.
[02:14:37.663 --> 02:14:39.124]  What I'm trying to say is this.
[02:14:39.884 --> 02:14:47.049]  If we have a society that presumably is based on the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven, then we have a system...
[02:14:47.731 --> 02:15:02.077]  A matrix system, or an echelon system, or a real-time system that puts people who've never had any contact with the police in that system, then you have police operating on the presumption that everybody is guilty of something.
[02:15:02.097 --> 02:15:04.598]  Hey, Ron, Ron, they tell us we've still got a Fourth Amendment.
[02:15:06.262 --> 02:15:08.483]  I told people about this two years before it was in the news.
[02:15:08.984 --> 02:15:10.544]  Your OnStar listens to you.
[02:15:10.845 --> 02:15:11.945]  Listens, not just tracks you.
[02:15:11.985 --> 02:15:12.325]  Listens.
[02:15:12.845 --> 02:15:13.446]  They've been caught.
[02:15:14.226 --> 02:15:16.867]  Your cell phones, even when they're turned off, can listen to you.
[02:15:17.968 --> 02:15:20.709]  Your car has systems that track you now, most of the new ones.
[02:15:21.729 --> 02:15:22.830]  Everything's tracking you.
[02:15:22.870 --> 02:15:23.751]  Everything's controlled.
[02:15:23.911 --> 02:15:25.872]  RFID's going in the products to track you.
[02:15:26.172 --> 02:15:28.834]  The national TV's saying everybody needs a microchip.
[02:15:28.874 --> 02:15:30.755]  I mean, we're in the twilight zone, brother.
[02:15:30.775 --> 02:15:33.877]  I mean, you think I'm wrong to rant and rave and freak out?
[02:15:33.917 --> 02:15:35.097]  Alex, I know.
[02:15:35.217 --> 02:15:36.738]  I worked for that system.
[02:15:36.838 --> 02:15:38.119]  I was part of that system.
[02:15:38.239 --> 02:15:40.480]  I still keep my finger on the pulse of that system.
[02:15:40.520 --> 02:15:44.083]  You've been telling the truth consistently for the two years I've been listening to you.
[02:15:44.483 --> 02:15:49.766]  But the only thing that they don't track, and you could read the New York Post about this today, the only one that wasn't tracked
[02:15:50.306 --> 02:15:55.593]  He'd been picked up and released because all these guys, as we knew, were informants and agents.
[02:16:08.969 --> 02:16:09.909]  Please, it gets better.
[02:16:10.510 --> 02:16:10.770]  I know.
[02:16:10.830 --> 02:16:11.910]  It's the same amount of time.
[02:16:12.750 --> 02:16:20.173]  He was permitted, even though he was on a terrorist watch list, he was permitted to come to the United States and visit his mother in Cleveland, Ohio in 2000.
[02:16:20.213 --> 02:16:21.793]  Sir, it's the same thing with Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:23.314 --> 02:16:25.654]  They leave the country for a summit.
[02:16:25.754 --> 02:16:27.395]  The embassy says, no, you're terrorists.
[02:16:27.415 --> 02:16:28.955]  And they get a call from the CIA.
[02:16:28.995 --> 02:16:30.216]  We've had the people from the embassy on.
[02:16:30.236 --> 02:16:32.717]  They're told they're part of a secret anti-terror drill.
[02:16:32.757 --> 02:16:33.317]  Let them in.
[02:16:33.337 --> 02:16:35.057]  And then they run drills on 9-11.
[02:16:35.237 --> 02:16:36.598]  And the guys are part of the drills.
[02:16:36.638 --> 02:16:37.178]  And look what happens.
[02:16:37.865 --> 02:16:45.847]  And then they could keep track of him, this British citizen, in Cleveland, Ohio, but the British intelligence says, when he got back to England, we lost track of him.
[02:16:45.867 --> 02:16:47.347]  But you could keep track of him in Cleveland, Ohio.
[02:16:47.367 --> 02:16:50.088]  And the French are blowing the whistle, and again, let me boil it down.
[02:16:50.968 --> 02:16:51.768]  The same M.O.
[02:16:51.908 --> 02:17:00.130]  They're government informants, happy little members of the British community, thought they were fighting Muslim extremism, and boy, did they find out different.
[02:17:00.859 --> 02:17:12.143]  And the funniest part about it is the only one of the conspirators, or alleged conspirators here, that they don't have a photograph of was the one guy that they had supposedly been tracking for nearly 12 years.
[02:17:12.323 --> 02:17:15.684]  But everybody else who just came out of the woodwork... That's because he's the controller.
[02:17:17.464 --> 02:17:18.925]  There's something wrong with this picture.
[02:17:19.365 --> 02:17:22.866]  Two plus two in the world of logic must add up to four, and when it doesn't...
[02:17:23.542 --> 02:17:26.765]  People, American people, I speak to you through the... It's the same M.O.
[02:17:26.865 --> 02:17:29.687]  Hey, Ron, who's got the motive for the attacks, number one?
[02:17:29.967 --> 02:17:31.488]  Who's been caught doing it in the past?
[02:17:31.869 --> 02:17:33.570]  And then the attacks fit the same M.O.
[02:17:33.610 --> 02:17:40.035]  precisely as past operations, covered up by drills, with operatives being killed and being called the terrorists.
[02:17:46.204 --> 02:17:52.568]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:17:52.788 --> 02:17:57.830]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:17:58.131 --> 02:18:06.035]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:18:06.195 --> 02:18:13.239]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:18:13.459 --> 02:18:14.660]  There are no side effects.
[02:18:14.821 --> 02:18:18.205]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:18:18.265 --> 02:18:20.948]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.
[02:18:21.148 --> 02:18:27.997]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:18:28.097 --> 02:18:30.560]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:33.665]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.

[02:18:33.745 --> 02:18:34.687]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:18:46.121 --> 02:18:49.104]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:18:49.124 --> 02:18:58.274]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:18:58.614 --> 02:19:03.299]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:19:03.739 --> 02:19:10.465]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:19:10.866 --> 02:19:22.676]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:23.116 --> 02:19:27.601]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:19:27.761 --> 02:19:32.346]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:19:32.566 --> 02:19:35.869]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:19:35.969 --> 02:19:38.692]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:19:38.872 --> 02:19:42.256]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:19:42.376 --> 02:19:43.477]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:45.407 --> 02:19:49.091]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:19:49.491 --> 02:19:54.916]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:19:55.377 --> 02:19:56.458]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[02:19:56.498 --> 02:20:00.522]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:20:01.182 --> 02:20:14.490]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:20:14.510 --> 02:20:20.333]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:20:20.593 --> 02:20:26.477]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:20:26.817 --> 02:20:26.877]  1-800-686-2237
[02:20:44.939 --> 02:20:46.380]  You can order everything you need on the web.
[02:21:03.274 --> 02:21:03.734]  We're good to go.
[02:21:19.002 --> 02:21:19.863]  We're good to go.
[02:21:19.883 --> 02:21:20.263]  We're good to go.
[02:21:51.034 --> 02:21:56.795]  No, it really gets tiring at times how much evidence there is of this being a government op.
[02:21:57.455 --> 02:22:09.578]  And it mirrors all the others to a T. We know the people that got on those planes, the supposed hijackers, had their houses, cars, credit cards paid for by the government.
[02:22:10.441 --> 02:22:15.203]  We know that they ordered the embassies, the consulates, to let them back into the U.S.
[02:22:15.644 --> 02:22:17.324]  and told them, oh, they're part of a secret drill.
[02:22:17.344 --> 02:22:20.946]  We know they were doing drills, and we know that's what happened on 9-11.
[02:22:22.127 --> 02:22:23.467]  They killed their patsies.
[02:22:24.668 --> 02:22:26.389]  You've got these guys whose M.O.
[02:22:26.409 --> 02:22:31.311]  depends nothing near a suicide bomber, you know, eight-month-old babies teaching retarded children.
[02:22:32.371 --> 02:22:33.872]  No connections to, quote, extremists.
[02:22:35.053 --> 02:22:38.514]  And they all meet up smiling, happy.
[02:22:38.554 --> 02:22:39.515]  They go get on their trains.
[02:22:40.811 --> 02:22:52.321]  And the bus blows up, and then the camera malfunctions, and there's a drill at the exact same time of the exact same thing happening, and the whole government agenda is in deep trouble, and this just magically happens.
[02:22:52.401 --> 02:22:55.324]  And then, you know, it just never ends.
[02:22:56.284 --> 02:23:02.690]  And then the same thing, letting them back in and out of the country, having them on the terrorist watch list, just not keeping track of them.
[02:23:03.511 --> 02:23:05.632]  It's just classic behavior, folks.
[02:23:05.973 --> 02:23:06.433]  Classic.
[02:23:06.853 --> 02:23:07.794]  David in Illinois.
[02:23:07.814 --> 02:23:08.495]  David, go ahead.
[02:23:09.534 --> 02:23:12.415]  Alex, I want to thank you for the privilege of being able to talk to you.
[02:23:13.015 --> 02:23:14.436]  Oh, it's a privilege to talk to you, buddy.
[02:23:15.456 --> 02:23:17.376]  Well, we'll see, huh?
[02:23:17.697 --> 02:23:18.777]  It is for me, for sure.
[02:23:19.557 --> 02:23:21.818]  And amen, Brother Jones.
[02:23:21.838 --> 02:23:24.239]  You've been speaking mighty powerfully here.
[02:23:25.959 --> 02:23:31.821]  One thing that I didn't plan on talking about, but I'd like to make a comment on, are these cops that shot the infant.
[02:23:32.641 --> 02:23:37.363]  You know, firemen, they risk their lives to go into a building in case there's a...
[02:23:39.938 --> 02:23:42.700]  On average, firemen have so much more courage than cops.
[02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:43.720]  Exactly.
[02:23:43.881 --> 02:23:47.763]  And cops, they seem to think that their life is more valued.
[02:23:47.803 --> 02:23:49.304]  They're supposed to protect the citizen.
[02:23:49.685 --> 02:23:55.409]  Their life, they are... For killing a cop, the average time is life without parole.
[02:23:55.909 --> 02:23:58.691]  And for killing a citizen, the average is like seven years.
[02:24:00.485 --> 02:24:10.187]  Well, a cop should lay his life on the line for... Did you know that if a police dog gets killed in the line of duty, the person on average spends more time in jail than if they killed a human?
[02:24:11.127 --> 02:24:11.968]  Oh, I noticed that.
[02:24:12.488 --> 02:24:14.468]  Their dogs are worth more than us.
[02:24:15.868 --> 02:24:22.390]  You know, I recently discovered your show here on AM Station in Northern Illinois, and...
[02:24:23.616 --> 02:24:25.257]  It was a great find.
[02:24:25.777 --> 02:24:29.620]  And sometimes I think you give me hope for our society.
[02:24:29.660 --> 02:24:33.542]  And then other times I wonder if you're the real deal here.
[02:24:33.562 --> 02:24:35.784]  So I need some convincing.
[02:24:37.065 --> 02:24:38.125]  No, you don't need convincing.
[02:24:38.145 --> 02:24:40.107]  And I'm going to stop you right there and just say this.
[02:24:40.887 --> 02:24:43.469]  Alex Jones doesn't matter.
[02:24:43.929 --> 02:24:44.990]  And I am the real deal.
[02:24:45.050 --> 02:24:46.090]  Okay, this is the real McCoy.
[02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:46.571]  You hear it?
[02:24:47.011 --> 02:24:48.492]  But the point is it isn't about me.
[02:24:49.184 --> 02:24:51.286]  They admit fluoride's deadly for us.
[02:24:51.406 --> 02:24:53.127]  They admit sodium fluoride.
[02:24:53.467 --> 02:24:55.309]  They admit that aspartame is deadly.
[02:24:55.389 --> 02:24:56.590]  Literally thousands of studies.
[02:24:56.990 --> 02:24:59.051]  They admit that mercury in vaccines is bad.
[02:24:59.071 --> 02:25:00.252]  They've increased the level, by the way.
[02:25:00.673 --> 02:25:03.455]  It's admitted they sprayed our troops in Project Shad and killed them.
[02:25:03.755 --> 02:25:08.779]  It's admitted they let black men have syphilis and in some cases gave it to them and let them spread it for 45 years.
[02:25:09.239 --> 02:25:12.401]  It's admitted that they did all these things, sir.
[02:25:12.782 --> 02:25:16.985]  It's admitted that Saddam was our boy and didn't have WMD and they told him to invade Kuwait.
[02:25:17.873 --> 02:25:21.015]  What is important, sir, is that you check out what I say.
[02:25:21.556 --> 02:25:22.777]  Do not believe me.
[02:25:23.277 --> 02:25:25.119]  Don't just go off a gut feeling.
[02:25:25.459 --> 02:25:26.379]  Check out what I'm saying.
[02:25:26.399 --> 02:25:27.200]  I want you to know.
[02:25:27.220 --> 02:25:42.812]  What do you think when a Prime Minister of Israel says in the Knesset that they control our Congress, when we have Elmo Zumwalt, who was a former commander in Vietnam, saying one out of four defense dollars goes to Israel, and when he's talking to
[02:25:43.935 --> 02:25:46.517]  A Jewish group trying to get their vote for senator.
[02:25:46.978 --> 02:25:53.343]  And the Jewish liberals should change their position on military industrial spending because it benefits Israel.
[02:25:53.423 --> 02:25:54.544]  Those are crucial issues.
[02:25:54.604 --> 02:25:56.485]  Well, and they became the neocons, and they have.
[02:25:56.505 --> 02:25:58.527]  But what is this?
[02:25:58.567 --> 02:26:04.732]  Well, a prior caller, I wondered if you got angry with him because he... I mean, first of all, he...
[02:26:07.054 --> 02:26:12.398]  Question some of your knowledge, you know, and you're an alpha male, and you resented that, and that's just fine.
[02:26:12.438 --> 02:26:13.098]  No, I didn't.
[02:26:13.118 --> 02:26:15.219]  Are you talking about John?
[02:26:15.239 --> 02:26:17.421]  I believe.
[02:26:18.562 --> 02:26:23.925]  No, I mean, John calls all the time, and he made excuses for why we gave him the Panama Canal.
[02:26:24.385 --> 02:26:30.589]  He was denying that they put Mao in when they admit they did, and I was trying to explain that to him, and he was on for ten minutes.
[02:26:30.609 --> 02:26:31.310]  I got sick of it.
[02:26:31.798 --> 02:26:35.060]  Yeah, you gave him ample opportunity to express himself.
[02:26:35.080 --> 02:26:36.920]  Okay, then, what does this mean, sir?
[02:26:37.541 --> 02:26:41.843]  Well, another caller had recommended a book by Paul Finley.
[02:26:41.943 --> 02:26:46.325]  They dare to speak out, and you acted as if you weren't familiar with it, and that's possible to me.
[02:26:46.625 --> 02:26:50.947]  Yeah, I'm not familiar with it, and, gee, this is insanity right now.
[02:26:51.447 --> 02:26:52.668]  Well, he was a former U.S.
[02:26:52.728 --> 02:26:55.369]  congressman who did put the United States... Oh, yeah, that's the guy.
[02:26:55.509 --> 02:26:56.289]  I've heard about the book.
[02:26:56.429 --> 02:26:57.490]  Okay, now I've heard of it, yeah.
[02:26:58.070 --> 02:26:58.430]  He put the...
[02:27:00.606 --> 02:27:05.349]  A priority over the welfare of the United States, over the welfare of Israel.
[02:27:05.710 --> 02:27:08.051]  And he was just drummed out, and he's gone.
[02:27:08.211 --> 02:27:09.072]  And you don't hear about him.
[02:27:09.232 --> 02:27:10.133]  Was he in Michigan?
[02:27:10.833 --> 02:27:11.834]  He was from Illinois.
[02:27:12.014 --> 02:27:12.875]  Illinois, that's right.
[02:27:13.855 --> 02:27:20.320]  So, anyway, I think you're not like the Rush Limbaugh as the Democrats or the Republicans.
[02:27:20.340 --> 02:27:21.821]  You're the real man, aren't you, Alex?
[02:27:22.661 --> 02:27:24.282]  No, since you said it like that, I'm not.
[02:27:24.723 --> 02:27:25.463]  Okay, I'm bad.
[02:27:25.964 --> 02:27:26.544]  Thank you for the call.
[02:27:27.759 --> 02:27:31.083]  It isn't about Alex Jones fitting all of your litmus tests, okay?
[02:27:31.304 --> 02:27:32.765]  It's about fighting the New World Order.
[02:27:33.106 --> 02:27:33.606]  I'm bad.
[02:27:33.787 --> 02:27:34.307]  Don't listen.
[02:27:36.029 --> 02:27:36.971]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.431 --> 02:27:39.053]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.954 --> 02:27:42.638]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:29:34.626 --> 02:29:37.886]  Keep it clean, and you don't have to keep replacing parts.

[02:29:49.201 --> 02:29:49.721]  are located?

[02:30:51.340 --> 02:30:57.966]  Look, that caller, that last caller, somebody says, Alex, you are the good person, aren't you?
[02:30:58.306 --> 02:30:59.647]  You really are for real.
[02:31:00.068 --> 02:31:00.988]  Yes, yes, I'm for real.
[02:31:01.409 --> 02:31:03.510]  Alex, you really are the good person.
[02:31:04.031 --> 02:31:06.053]  You really are for real, aren't you?
[02:31:06.753 --> 02:31:07.594]  No, I'm bad.
[02:31:08.935 --> 02:31:11.157]  As a species, we all do bad things.
[02:31:11.798 --> 02:31:12.939]  Do I fight the New World Order?
[02:31:12.959 --> 02:31:14.380]  Am I the real deal in what I say?
[02:31:14.420 --> 02:31:15.080]  Yes, I am.
[02:31:15.621 --> 02:31:16.862]  But that doesn't matter.
[02:31:17.478 --> 02:31:21.521]  We've got to get past believing what somebody says and check into what they actually do.
[02:31:22.361 --> 02:31:24.983]  This show, though, is not about Alex Jones.
[02:31:25.063 --> 02:31:26.004]  It makes me sick.
[02:31:28.065 --> 02:31:30.507]  I mean, are you concerned about the aspartame in the food?
[02:31:30.547 --> 02:31:33.089]  Are you concerned about the fluoride, the mercury in the vaccines?
[02:31:34.530 --> 02:31:35.771]  Can you please bring that up?
[02:31:35.811 --> 02:31:38.212]  Can you please talk about that instead of me?
[02:31:38.232 --> 02:31:42.235]  I mean, get out there and get involved.
[02:31:42.295 --> 02:31:43.196]  You know you're good.
[02:31:43.236 --> 02:31:46.418]  Why don't you go out and get involved and deal with issues?
[02:31:47.717 --> 02:31:52.880]  Then implying I don't know about some book, or I do know about it, and I'm not talking about it.
[02:31:52.900 --> 02:31:54.181]  I mean, it's just craziness.
[02:31:55.062 --> 02:31:56.142]  It's craziness.
[02:32:00.005 --> 02:32:09.071]  I don't know, I'm just... I mean, as you can tell, I've gotten very angry today on the show, very upset about what communist Chinese generals threatening to destroy 200 U.S.
[02:32:09.091 --> 02:32:09.311]  cities...
[02:32:12.637 --> 02:32:14.839]  All this news about more and more studies coming out.
[02:32:14.859 --> 02:32:18.962]  This is the BBC and AP about how deadly aspartame and fluoride is.
[02:32:19.843 --> 02:32:21.104]  And I get upset about that.
[02:32:21.204 --> 02:32:29.270]  And I really get upset when somebody asks me the same question a couple times and I keep answering it and it's just like it's a fun game or something.
[02:32:29.710 --> 02:32:31.231]  This is not a game, folks.
[02:32:31.271 --> 02:32:32.232]  This is life and death.
[02:32:35.083 --> 02:32:39.386]  And let's just cover some news, and then I'll probably have time to go to Kevin, Kevin, Charlie, and Pam.
[02:32:39.406 --> 02:32:40.326]  That'll be it for calls.
[02:32:40.346 --> 02:32:44.869]  And I've got a few audio clips I want to play, but... Sweetener linked to leukemia, BBC.
[02:32:44.889 --> 02:32:47.531]  I don't know, I just wish you could talk about that.
[02:32:47.551 --> 02:32:50.012]  United Nations calls for U.S.
[02:32:50.232 --> 02:32:50.973]  net pullout.
[02:32:51.994 --> 02:32:53.635]  United Nations has said that the U.S.
[02:32:53.655 --> 02:32:56.136]  must hand over control of the Internet and web to...
[02:32:58.266 --> 02:33:05.311]  To international body, and they've already said five years ago they're going to regulate speech, and who can have a website, and it's horrible.
[02:33:07.613 --> 02:33:10.635]  And again, should you trust me on that, just go to my website.
[02:33:10.655 --> 02:33:14.278]  I've got like MSNBC and the London Inquirer on it.
[02:33:14.318 --> 02:33:15.979]  I mean, just go read what the UN has said.
[02:33:16.039 --> 02:33:17.740]  Do not believe what I just said.
[02:33:18.440 --> 02:33:19.281]  Check it out!
[02:33:19.861 --> 02:33:22.563]  Don't go off how I sound or what I say.
[02:33:24.064 --> 02:33:25.566]  George Bush says he's conservative.
[02:33:25.586 --> 02:33:25.986]  He's not.
[02:33:27.561 --> 02:33:30.124]  I want you to check me out if that's what you're into.
[02:33:31.725 --> 02:33:32.546]  God help us, man.
[02:33:32.566 --> 02:33:33.867]  We've got to get our priorities straight.
[02:33:33.947 --> 02:33:35.088]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:33:35.108 --> 02:33:39.973]  Again, Harvard professor, investigative in fluoridation research.
[02:33:40.333 --> 02:33:41.474]  Covering up the floor, I really did.
[02:33:41.494 --> 02:33:42.155]  Associated Press.
[02:33:43.274 --> 02:33:44.055]  American-U.S.
[02:33:44.095 --> 02:33:45.516]  transit attacks inevitable.
[02:33:45.576 --> 02:33:47.858]  London bombings boost Bush approval ratings.
[02:33:48.318 --> 02:33:58.246]  Associated Press today, most Americans think a terrorist attack on the train, bus, or subway in the United States is inevitable, but there's no evidence that they are in any more fearful about their own safety after the London bombings.
[02:33:58.966 --> 02:34:04.831]  The AP poll did show that Bush's approval rating has gone up substantively.
[02:34:04.891 --> 02:34:05.671]  So there you go.
[02:34:05.711 --> 02:34:06.532]  Who's got the motive?
[02:34:07.533 --> 02:34:09.214]  Well, Al-Qaeda always comes with a rescue.
[02:34:10.445 --> 02:34:11.166]  Of the globalists.
[02:34:11.306 --> 02:34:14.849]  London Stagecoach employees say bombing suspicious.
[02:34:14.949 --> 02:34:20.553]  Paul Watson, one of our listeners, emailed prisonplanet.com and pulled an article on this.
[02:34:21.814 --> 02:34:37.707]  And the Stagecoach employee talked about weird contractors they'd never seen there at the bus station working on the bus, how there's a whole bunch of cameras on the bus, not one, how it goes to a hard drive under the bus, and how it wasn't malfunctioning, basically.
[02:34:38.405 --> 02:34:49.490]  And how that was the only bus that, after the trains had already been bombed, that it was waved specifically by police into a specific area where none of the other buses were waved, and then it blew up.
[02:34:50.010 --> 02:34:56.393]  We didn't even find a clip about that in London Guardian, so that's confirmed, that one part of this person who works for the company.
[02:34:57.814 --> 02:35:02.176]  Of course, we're withholding their name for their safety, but we did check it out.
[02:35:02.896 --> 02:35:04.737]  Another contradiction in the London bombings...
[02:35:06.031 --> 02:35:15.013]  MSNBC today, Western intelligence sources tell NBC News that three of the suspects in London bombing plot, including one of the suspected bombers, have U.S.
[02:35:15.053 --> 02:35:15.613]  connections.
[02:35:15.674 --> 02:35:24.796]  These sources also say authorities are now back to believing that the explosive material was homemade, similar to that found in the shoe of one of the shoe bombers.
[02:35:24.836 --> 02:35:29.177]  Richard Reid, Associated Press, bombs that shook the city subway system last week.
[02:35:29.617 --> 02:35:33.118]  Exploded with 50 seconds of each other and were made of high explosives.
[02:35:33.518 --> 02:35:34.799]  Not homemade material.
[02:35:35.259 --> 02:35:36.379]  Police said Saturday.
[02:35:36.439 --> 02:35:37.040]  Flashback.
[02:35:37.080 --> 02:35:39.601]  London bombs made from military explosives.
[02:35:42.121 --> 02:35:42.762]  Kurt Nemo.
[02:35:42.802 --> 02:35:43.542]  Good article here.
[02:35:43.602 --> 02:35:44.442]  Mission accomplished.
[02:35:44.502 --> 02:35:46.003]  Brits embrace police state.
[02:35:46.043 --> 02:35:48.444]  Now they want the national ID card in total control.
[02:35:48.484 --> 02:35:51.525]  But the government's been caught creating false polls before, so I don't know about that.
[02:35:52.385 --> 02:35:55.466]  But if they announce that the polls say that, a lot of people will be sucked into it.
[02:35:56.124 --> 02:35:58.225]  UK ministers push for data retention.
[02:35:58.266 --> 02:36:00.967]  They want their own snipping systems for everything you do.
[02:36:01.628 --> 02:36:03.749]  House Intelligence Committee approves Patriot Act.
[02:36:03.789 --> 02:36:11.174]  The House Intelligence Committee has approved renewal of the USA Patriot Act, allowing just one provision to expire five years from now.
[02:36:12.155 --> 02:36:14.576]  And it has nothing to do with fighting terrorism, of course.
[02:36:15.517 --> 02:36:19.039]  And continuing, French say suspects were arrested then freed.
[02:36:19.620 --> 02:36:21.281]  Yeah, that's the Belfast Telegraph.
[02:36:21.301 --> 02:36:24.723]  That's all part of controlling and protecting their operatives.
[02:36:26.977 --> 02:36:38.023]  By the way, that article we read about the London bombing, that article with the guy at the bus company is on prisonplanet.com.
[02:36:38.443 --> 02:36:45.827]  So I hope that you will check that out because it is extremely, extremely important.
[02:36:48.149 --> 02:36:50.590]  Let me get into some of this stack over here.
[02:36:52.112 --> 02:36:53.953]  We're on that daily out propagandizing.
[02:36:54.053 --> 02:36:55.893]  Al-Qaeda nukes already in U.S.
[02:36:55.914 --> 02:37:00.395]  terrorist bombs smuggled across Mexico border by MS-13 gangsters.
[02:37:01.776 --> 02:37:04.677]  I don't like MS-13, but that's just a bunch of propaganda, folks.
[02:37:05.317 --> 02:37:06.818]  Top Chinese general warns U.S.
[02:37:06.878 --> 02:37:07.438]  over attack.
[02:37:07.458 --> 02:37:08.678]  Threatens to nuke 200 cities.
[02:37:08.698 --> 02:37:11.979]  Already mentioned that, but that's an MSNBC article I just read the headline from.
[02:37:12.480 --> 02:37:13.880]  Not the Financial Times of London.
[02:37:14.941 --> 02:37:18.542]  China-Russia issue joint statement on New World Order.
[02:37:19.733 --> 02:37:24.797]  This is out of the People's Daily Online, the official communist newspaper in China.
[02:37:25.477 --> 02:37:26.758]  Oh, the New World Order doesn't exist.
[02:37:26.898 --> 02:37:30.621]  China and Russia here Friday issued a joint statement on the New World Order.
[02:37:31.101 --> 02:37:34.804]  The 21st century setting forth their common stand on major international issues.
[02:37:35.184 --> 02:37:40.808]  This is UN reforms, globalization, north-south cooperation, and world economic trade.
[02:37:41.208 --> 02:37:47.813]  The statement was signed by Russian President Vladimir Putin and visiting Chinese President Hu Jintao after their talks.
[02:37:47.893 --> 02:37:48.093]  So...
[02:37:49.286 --> 02:37:53.190]  They call for a one-world government, but again, Rush Limbaugh says it doesn't exist.
[02:37:53.530 --> 02:37:55.192]  All right.
[02:37:55.232 --> 02:37:58.876]  More than 1,000 people will be possible terrorized in the United States.
[02:37:59.336 --> 02:38:00.718]  Explosives readily available.
[02:38:00.818 --> 02:38:01.538]  ABC News.
[02:38:01.578 --> 02:38:03.100]  We can be bombed any minute.
[02:38:03.120 --> 02:38:05.622]  Give up all your rights to the nearest person in a black mask.
[02:38:06.483 --> 02:38:08.025]  This is out of the news channel...
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:11.501]  KTUL in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[02:38:11.541 --> 02:38:15.462]  Tulsa attacked with bubonic plague and disaster drill.
[02:38:15.502 --> 02:38:23.205]  This is meant psychologically to create the subconscious view that you're being attacked by terrorists to have more fear and give up your liberty.
[02:38:23.225 --> 02:38:27.507]  They've had thousands of these drills before 9-11 and now after, and they're increasing them.
[02:38:28.087 --> 02:38:32.229]  Iraq to probe alleged police torture and killings.
[02:38:32.269 --> 02:38:32.849]  This out...
[02:38:33.667 --> 02:38:35.388]  This is happening every day.
[02:38:35.408 --> 02:38:37.689]  They drill their knees, they pull their teeth out with pliers.
[02:39:03.317 --> 02:39:03.938]  They raped them.
[02:39:03.958 --> 02:39:05.799]  They also tortured their children in front of them.
[02:39:06.259 --> 02:39:10.322]  That's admitted even inside Abu Ghraib, but Rush Limbaugh says it doesn't even count as torture.
[02:39:11.803 --> 02:39:12.864]  Oh, boy.
[02:39:13.024 --> 02:39:17.507]  Australia to consider ID card to fight terrorism, so they're using the police state as a way to take over.
[02:39:18.048 --> 02:39:18.928]  I've got some other news.
[02:39:18.988 --> 02:39:20.990]  Your phone calls we're going to take here in just a moment.
[02:39:21.830 --> 02:39:26.774]  But right now, let's go to this clip out of the Midwest up there in Missouri.
[02:39:27.927 --> 02:39:33.631]  With the police tasering somebody a whole bunch of times after they were handcuffed on their own video camera.
[02:39:34.091 --> 02:39:38.134]  And this time the police chief didn't erase the videos or deny it, which most police chiefs do.
[02:39:38.655 --> 02:39:39.836]  He actually did the right thing.
[02:39:40.636 --> 02:39:41.977]  And they're going to probably fire him.
[02:39:42.658 --> 02:39:44.479]  So let's go ahead and play this clip.
[02:39:48.180 --> 02:39:53.103]  Two Kansas City police officers could lose their jobs because of the way they used a taser.
[02:39:53.324 --> 02:39:54.064]  Good evening, everyone.
[02:39:54.104 --> 02:39:56.005]  The department says it was excessive force.
[02:39:56.065 --> 02:39:58.187]  The officers say the suspect was combative.
[02:39:58.467 --> 02:40:01.209]  Now the Kansas City, Missouri Police Board will consider their fate.
[02:40:01.249 --> 02:40:05.192]  KFBC 9's Beth Chapman is live right now outside police headquarters with more.
[02:40:05.212 --> 02:40:05.412]  Beth?
[02:40:06.494 --> 02:40:18.742]  Larry, commissioners meeting here at the police department will be deciding whether these officers will lose their job over an arrest in the use of a taser, an incident that was captured on an in-car camera last August.
[02:40:27.087 --> 02:40:30.409]  There is no dispute the first tasing follows procedure.
[02:40:30.789 --> 02:40:32.971]  Officers David Easley and Matthew Howell
[02:40:34.449 --> 02:40:42.658]  Use a taser that delivers an electrical current like this one to stop a man they believe is a car thief resisting arrest.
[02:40:42.798 --> 02:40:47.222]  We were down on those streets and he began to kick at my head and my face to try to get away.
[02:40:47.463 --> 02:40:51.327]  Police commissioners will have to determine whether the men went too far.
[02:40:52.691 --> 02:40:53.632]  He's got tased again.
[02:40:53.932 --> 02:41:00.858]  According to police policy, a suspect must be actively resisting arrest, fighting, running, using threatening words or posture.
[02:41:01.339 --> 02:41:06.744]  At this point, the man is already handcuffed when he's tasered for the fifth time.
[02:41:06.764 --> 02:41:13.069]  He then was allowed to fall without anybody breaking his fall.
[02:41:13.089 --> 02:41:15.972]  I was very concerned that we had just punished
[02:41:16.923 --> 02:41:18.044]  A prisoner in our custody.
[02:41:18.124 --> 02:41:20.125]  Chief Corwin recommended the men be fired.
[02:41:20.305 --> 02:41:24.447]  The first time that's happened since the department began using tasers last year.
[02:41:24.967 --> 02:41:28.189]  Other officers and their families were at the day-long hearing.
[02:41:28.629 --> 02:41:32.411]  Officer Howell, who handled the taser, said he was following his training.
[02:41:32.672 --> 02:41:35.373]  The whole beauty of the taser was you don't have to get in a fight.
[02:41:35.393 --> 02:41:36.694]  You don't have to get in a struggle.
[02:41:36.714 --> 02:41:38.095]  It's hands-off.
[02:41:38.135 --> 02:41:38.835]  Nobody gets hurt.
[02:41:38.875 --> 02:41:39.575]  Nobody gets sued.
[02:41:39.735 --> 02:41:40.556]  All right, that's enough.
[02:41:41.545 --> 02:41:42.265]  Of that clip.
[02:41:42.425 --> 02:41:44.146]  And look, the statistics are out.
[02:41:44.446 --> 02:41:47.308]  When you defend bad cops, stuff gets worse.
[02:41:47.428 --> 02:41:49.088]  You actually pay out more in suits.
[02:41:49.629 --> 02:41:58.293]  When you fire people that violate the procedures, it should be the law, the Constitution, it's good for everybody, including the police.
[02:41:58.493 --> 02:42:00.093]  When you don't, it causes problems.
[02:42:01.054 --> 02:42:05.516]  Major police chiefs in major cities like Seattle have gone public and written books about this.
[02:42:06.880 --> 02:42:09.261]  This next clip is a little comedy piece.
[02:42:09.621 --> 02:42:22.264]  It's not as funny without the video, the cartoon, but it's a little tattletale stoolie pigeon talking about the arrest of reporters concerning Karl Rove and several other issues.
[02:42:22.304 --> 02:42:23.324]  So go ahead and roll that.
[02:42:23.344 --> 02:42:24.564]  Tweet, tweet!
[02:42:24.604 --> 02:42:24.864]  Hi, kids!
[02:42:24.924 --> 02:42:26.324]  I'm Stevie the stoolie!
[02:42:26.364 --> 02:42:30.225]  Let me tell you all about your wonderful new freedom!
[02:42:34.469 --> 02:42:37.872]  Confidential sources?
[02:42:37.932 --> 02:42:39.513]  More like troublemakers.
[02:42:39.553 --> 02:42:42.596]  Why should reporters be allowed to keep them hidden away?
[02:42:42.616 --> 02:42:44.418]  Tweet, tweet!
[02:42:44.638 --> 02:42:48.381]  A federal official blowing a CIA agent's cover?
[02:42:48.781 --> 02:42:49.742]  Who cares?
[02:42:50.362 --> 02:42:53.665]  What really burns me up are those governed reporters.
[02:42:54.566 --> 02:42:55.327]  Tweet, tweet!
[02:43:04.639 --> 02:43:05.340]  Tweet, tweet!
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:07.242]  What you don't know can't hurt you.
[02:43:07.302 --> 02:43:09.584]  Especially if we don't want you to know it.
[02:43:09.704 --> 02:43:10.585]  Tweet, tweet!
[02:43:10.686 --> 02:43:11.206]  Hey, beat it.
[02:43:11.526 --> 02:43:11.667]  There!
[02:43:11.707 --> 02:43:12.848]  That wasn't so hard, was it?
[02:43:12.868 --> 02:43:13.128]  See?
[02:43:13.188 --> 02:43:13.328]  Yeah!
[02:43:34.654 --> 02:43:35.415]  All right.
[02:43:35.475 --> 02:43:36.455]  Here is the Daily Show.
[02:43:36.495 --> 02:43:39.137]  We've had to cut out a few mild, you know, words.
[02:43:39.157 --> 02:43:42.159]  Not because they're even profane, but, you know, you've got to be above reproach.
[02:43:42.199 --> 02:43:43.580]  But it's pretty funny, folks.
[02:43:43.680 --> 02:43:44.500]  Here it is.
[02:44:03.547 --> 02:44:05.308]  Welcome to The Daily Show.
[02:44:05.348 --> 02:44:06.288]  I'm Jon Stewart.
[02:44:06.328 --> 02:44:08.509]  We have ourselves, we got ourselves a new studio.
[02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:10.390]  And, uh... What?
[02:44:10.410 --> 02:44:12.231]  You don't like it?
[02:44:12.531 --> 02:44:13.752]  No, it's beautiful.
[02:44:13.772 --> 02:44:14.292]  We pimped it.
[02:44:14.852 --> 02:44:18.514]  And, uh... It actually was a chance for me to fulfill a dream.
[02:44:19.255 --> 02:44:26.218]  The show is finally now produced, created, shot, and written entirely by robots.
[02:44:28.899 --> 02:44:29.880]  I am a robot.
[02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:32.721]  The real me is home right now watching Oprah.
[02:44:34.747 --> 02:44:40.569]  So we go away for about a week to fix the studio up, come into a new studio, get the thing, and all hell breaks loose.
[02:44:42.069 --> 02:44:43.329]  I'm not saying it's because we went away.
[02:44:43.469 --> 02:44:44.429]  I'm just saying that's what happened.
[02:44:45.850 --> 02:44:49.031]  The attacks in London, of course, certainly horrific.
[02:44:49.371 --> 02:44:54.692]  CNN's Aaron Brown reminded us of these attacks' real ramifications.
[02:44:55.922 --> 02:45:05.226]  In a CNN Gallup poll just completed tonight, 62% of those polled were worried about a similar attack in the United States in the next several weeks.
[02:45:05.927 --> 02:45:07.207]  Oh my God, that's so terrible!
[02:45:07.387 --> 02:45:08.088]  What about us?
[02:45:08.108 --> 02:45:15.871]  Interesting, the events happened overseas, yet a lot of Americans are very worried.
[02:45:15.891 --> 02:45:15.871]  62%.
[02:45:16.211 --> 02:45:19.393]  I wonder why Americans are so nervous about it.
[02:45:20.537 --> 02:45:24.960]  Who's at risk and how prepared are we?
[02:45:25.501 --> 02:45:26.501]  Oh.
[02:45:29.163 --> 02:45:30.704]  I... I see.
[02:45:30.724 --> 02:45:33.786]  But actually, those are just the intros and the graphics.
[02:45:33.826 --> 02:45:39.570]  I'm sure that the on-air cable hosts will bring some perspective, some context, some understanding to the coverage.
[02:45:40.297 --> 02:45:41.598]  Are we next in America?
[02:45:41.618 --> 02:45:43.238]  How safe are we in America?
[02:45:43.258 --> 02:45:46.179]  Can we prevent a subway or bus attack in the US?
[02:45:46.239 --> 02:45:49.540]  This is why I thought the Brits should have let the French have the Olympics.
[02:45:49.640 --> 02:45:50.661]  Why are they doing this?
[02:45:50.861 --> 02:45:54.202]  You have to wonder, will we ever truly feel safe again?
[02:45:59.242 --> 02:45:59.943]  I am nervous.
[02:46:00.723 --> 02:46:01.583]  So here's what was interesting.
[02:46:01.684 --> 02:46:07.667]  After four days of continuous coverage by the 24-hour news networks, Aaron Brown took another poll.
[02:46:08.107 --> 02:46:08.948]  Do we have that one?
[02:46:08.968 --> 02:46:09.348]  Oh!
[02:46:13.054 --> 02:46:15.255]  100% of the people themselves in fear!
[02:46:15.275 --> 02:46:16.195]  That's quite a change.
[02:46:16.856 --> 02:46:18.696]  Quite a change.
[02:46:19.057 --> 02:46:19.777]  You're a delight.
[02:46:20.737 --> 02:46:23.178]  By the way, the news shows brought in a lot of experts.
[02:46:23.358 --> 02:46:24.079]  Here is my favorite.
[02:46:24.299 --> 02:46:26.600]  This gentleman on Fox News, Waleed Shoubat.
[02:46:26.780 --> 02:46:30.681]  I don't know if you can see how they... Former terrorist!
[02:46:31.602 --> 02:46:32.742]  Former terrorist!
[02:46:32.762 --> 02:46:34.903]  I gotta tell ya.
[02:46:34.943 --> 02:46:39.205]  Don't you think that's gotta hurt Mr. Shoubat?
[02:46:39.245 --> 02:46:42.246]  Don't you think he's probably thinking, boy, is that all I am to you people?
[02:46:43.536 --> 02:46:45.758]  But the terrorist label really sticks on the resume.
[02:46:45.798 --> 02:46:48.581]  I'm sure Shoebat's done a lot of great things since then.
[02:46:48.821 --> 02:46:51.264]  Come on, I adopted a stretch of highway.
[02:46:51.304 --> 02:46:54.927]  Why always the terrorists?
[02:46:55.628 --> 02:47:00.513]  With more on this story in London, I'm joined by senior UK and Falkland Islands correspondent Rob Cordray.
[02:47:00.553 --> 02:47:01.453]  He is in London right now.
[02:47:01.514 --> 02:47:04.997]  Rob, thanks for being here.
[02:47:07.216 --> 02:47:07.937]  I want to talk to you.
[02:47:07.957 --> 02:47:11.120]  Obviously, you've been hearing a lot about the devastating attack on this city.
[02:47:11.521 --> 02:47:12.382]  What are you making of it?
[02:47:12.902 --> 02:47:20.070]  Once again, John, this senseless, bloody attack is a reminder to all Americans that the president's war on terror is working.
[02:47:25.180 --> 02:47:27.721]  How are the attacks proof the war on terror is working?
[02:47:27.981 --> 02:47:32.783]  Look, John, the president invaded Iraq in order to fight the war on terror over there.
[02:47:33.343 --> 02:47:35.604]  So he wouldn't have to fight it in America.
[02:47:36.204 --> 02:47:40.266]  And as you can see, I'm not in America.
[02:47:42.447 --> 02:47:44.668]  Rob, England is our ally, Rob.
[02:47:44.688 --> 02:47:47.350]  They're our partners in the coalition of the willing.
[02:47:47.410 --> 02:47:50.791]  Exactly, John, and therein lies the genius of Bush's strategy.
[02:47:51.272 --> 02:47:58.235]  By enlisting the aid, however small, of dozens of countries, Bush has also created a coalition of the bombables.
[02:47:59.676 --> 02:48:02.337]  Most of them way easier targets than us, too.
[02:48:02.757 --> 02:48:08.100]  Italy, Hungary, Poland, Costa Rica gave us those fighter monkeys.
[02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:10.841]  You know that's going to cost them.
[02:48:11.639 --> 02:48:14.001]  If I were living there right now, I'd be shaking in my boots.
[02:48:14.961 --> 02:48:16.182]  Or, uh, probably not boots.
[02:48:16.642 --> 02:48:18.243]  Um... Mucklucks?
[02:48:18.263 --> 02:48:21.045]  What are they wearing on their feet in Costa Rica?
[02:48:21.085 --> 02:48:21.465]  Shoes?
[02:48:22.946 --> 02:48:23.366]  Probably.
[02:48:26.408 --> 02:48:28.769]  Rob, it's been four days since the attacks.
[02:48:29.150 --> 02:48:30.470]  How are people in England holding up?
[02:48:30.911 --> 02:48:31.771]  Stoically, John.
[02:48:32.131 --> 02:48:34.193]  People here are conducting themselves with dignity.
[02:48:34.473 --> 02:48:37.855]  Going about their daily lives with strength and resiliency.
[02:48:38.635 --> 02:48:39.436]  It's disgraceful.
[02:48:39.456 --> 02:48:40.437]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:41.724 --> 02:48:42.164]  Stay with us.
[02:48:42.184 --> 02:48:43.225]  We'll play the end of that clip.
[02:49:07.277 --> 02:49:13.941]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[02:51:54.909 --> 02:51:57.892]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:59.533 --> 02:52:03.115]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:52:04.496 --> 02:52:06.378]  Tell them like it is, stand up for this country.
[02:52:07.626 --> 02:52:12.028]  Another video clip that's on the website is One City, One World displayed at Bombing Tribute.
[02:52:12.608 --> 02:52:15.990]  Our very own Simon Aranowitz, who's one of our contributors, shot the video.
[02:52:16.430 --> 02:52:22.733]  Media were made to wear London United tags at the ceremony that took place behind a banner that read One City, One World.

[02:52:39.770 --> 02:52:42.053]  But let's finish up with a Daily Show clip.
[02:52:42.093 --> 02:52:42.394]  Here it is.
[02:52:44.248 --> 02:52:46.590]  Rob, it's been four days since the attacks.
[02:52:46.991 --> 02:52:48.292]  How are people in England holding up?
[02:52:48.752 --> 02:52:49.613]  Stoically, John.
[02:52:49.973 --> 02:52:55.678]  People here are conducting themselves with dignity, going about their daily lives with strength and resiliency.
[02:52:56.459 --> 02:52:57.279]  It's disgraceful.
[02:52:58.821 --> 02:53:00.422]  Why is that disgraceful?
[02:53:00.522 --> 02:53:02.083]  John, come on.
[02:53:02.524 --> 02:53:03.785]  Where are the bumper stickers?
[02:53:04.265 --> 02:53:06.427]  The Union Jack lapel pins?
[02:53:06.487 --> 02:53:08.809]  The Wanted Dead or Alive posters?
[02:53:09.289 --> 02:53:12.152]  Where's the British version of our Paul McCartney singing freedom?
[02:53:18.444 --> 02:53:20.466]  Paul McCartney is British.
[02:53:21.307 --> 02:53:22.869]  Not the one who sang Freedom, John.
[02:53:22.909 --> 02:53:24.290]  That guy was all-American.
[02:53:25.251 --> 02:53:28.995]  And where are the country singers threatening to put boots up people's asses?
[02:53:29.776 --> 02:53:32.740]  It's like the British country and Western community doesn't even care.
[02:53:36.537 --> 02:53:37.438]  England's been through a lot.
[02:53:37.478 --> 02:53:41.560]  I think at this point, you know, World War II, IRA stuff, they're probably just tough.
[02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:45.161]  Well, forgive me, John, but who grieves this privately?
[02:53:45.702 --> 02:53:48.603]  This American likes his sorrow in T-shirt form.
[02:53:48.623 --> 02:53:49.443]  All right, that's enough.
[02:53:49.904 --> 02:53:56.987]  Just in case the other thing isn't cut out, I listened to that clip and that was that little mild thing was cut out, so I apologize about that.
[02:53:57.027 --> 02:53:58.648]  That was not cut out like it was supposed to be.
[02:53:59.643 --> 02:54:03.006]  But no, literally yesterday I did see big flags on the back of motorcycles.
[02:54:03.346 --> 02:54:07.610]  The plastic flags made in China by slaves are back on the vehicles.
[02:54:08.751 --> 02:54:09.632]  It's just mindless.
[02:54:09.872 --> 02:54:14.796]  Everything America stands for is dying because the globalists are using these attacks to do it.
[02:54:15.577 --> 02:54:22.603]  And the Daily Show really does make some good points, though I wish it wasn't so sophomoric the way it is done.
[02:54:22.663 --> 02:54:24.965]  So I apologize to folks about that mild stuff there.
[02:54:26.118 --> 02:54:27.140]  Heads will roll for that.
[02:54:27.200 --> 02:54:27.981]  I'm just joking.
[02:54:28.522 --> 02:54:29.624]  Let's talk to Pam.
[02:54:30.745 --> 02:54:31.707]  Pam, you're our last caller.
[02:54:31.727 --> 02:54:32.488]  Where are you calling from?
[02:54:32.828 --> 02:54:34.010]  I'm calling from Missouri.
[02:54:34.030 --> 02:54:34.972]  Hey, what's on your mind?
[02:54:34.992 --> 02:54:35.733]  We're almost out of time.
[02:54:36.073 --> 02:54:37.115]  Just a quick question.
[02:54:37.175 --> 02:54:38.938]  I wondered where Baby Bush was today.
[02:54:38.978 --> 02:54:40.781]  Was he going to go to Bohemian Grove?
[02:54:41.698 --> 02:54:45.359]  Well, usually when they're currently sitting as president, they don't go.
[02:54:46.299 --> 02:54:47.100]  Yes, you're right.
[02:54:47.120 --> 02:54:48.080]  I didn't mention it today.
[02:54:48.120 --> 02:54:57.382]  It's the fifth anniversary of my infiltration of the Bohemian Grove in July 15, 2000, where our Christian conservative leaders engage in satanic rituals.
[02:54:58.543 --> 02:54:59.203]  Thanks a lot.
[02:54:59.943 --> 02:55:00.583]  Thank you for the call.
[02:55:00.603 --> 02:55:01.804]  I guess we have time for another call.
[02:55:02.204 --> 02:55:03.244]  Did any of the callers hold?
[02:55:06.185 --> 02:55:06.885]  Kevin in Texas.
[02:55:06.925 --> 02:55:07.605]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[02:55:09.026 --> 02:55:10.426]  Hey, Alex, let me hit these real quick.
[02:55:11.411 --> 02:55:18.795]  The Bush family goes back, their China ties back to the opium trade with the William Russell Trust, the Tafts back in the 1850s, Boxer Rebellion.
[02:55:19.495 --> 02:55:24.638]  Herbert Walker Bush was an envoy to China before we officially recognized Red Communist China.
[02:55:25.238 --> 02:55:28.320]  Remember that P30 run that we landed in Chinese territory?
[02:55:28.420 --> 02:55:30.681]  And talk about a technology transfer, there's one.
[02:55:31.142 --> 02:55:35.804]  And currently, Uncle Prescott Bush is a top NGO business envoy to China.
[02:55:37.219 --> 02:55:39.241]  I spoke to Frank Court after you had him on today.
[02:55:39.281 --> 02:55:41.642]  We're going to work on a PSA for Radio Free Austin.
[02:55:41.662 --> 02:55:43.043]  We'll get that out this weekend.
[02:55:43.603 --> 02:55:47.825]  And left gatekeepers, man, how about these libertarian gatekeepers, too?
[02:55:47.865 --> 02:55:48.866]  They're frustrating.
[02:55:49.166 --> 02:55:49.946]  Let you go, my friend.
[02:55:49.966 --> 02:55:50.587]  Have a good day.
[02:55:50.627 --> 02:55:50.847]  Thank you.
[02:55:51.405 --> 02:55:51.825]  Thank you.
[02:55:51.845 --> 02:55:53.306]  We've got about 30 seconds left.
[02:55:53.326 --> 02:55:54.466]  Didn't plug it the last hour.
[02:55:54.506 --> 02:55:56.107]  I'll plug it this hour in 10 seconds.

[02:56:15.693 --> 02:56:16.613]  God bless you all.
[02:56:16.834 --> 02:56:17.954]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:19.199 --> 02:56:21.241]  And back throughout the weekend and back on Monday.
[02:56:21.442 --> 02:56:23.123]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:23.143 --> 02:56:23.864]  Vaya con Dios.
