[00:00:05.616 --> 00:00:06.256]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.916 --> 00:00:07.997]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.697 --> 00:00:09.778]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:11.278]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:12.899]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.241]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.762 --> 00:00:21.864]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.434 --> 00:00:40.734]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:45.996]  It is already Thursday, the 24th day of February 2005.
[00:00:46.917 --> 00:00:49.038]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.138 --> 00:00:54.880]  Coming up in the second hour, we're going to be talking to the group that's there trying to save
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.722]  Terry Shivo Schindler's life.
[00:00:58.062 --> 00:01:01.746]  They've now ordered her feeding tube removed.
[00:01:02.327 --> 00:01:11.295]  And the last time they did this, she survived for, what, eight, nine days before an emergency law was passed by the state of Florida.
[00:01:13.217 --> 00:01:16.881]  And now this court ruling has supposedly overturned that.
[00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:27.328]  But in matters of states' rights, the Tenth Amendment is still in force, and I think these federal court rulings are null and void.
[00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:29.970]  But that's up for debate.
[00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:35.115]  The Founding Fathers would agree with me, but, well, we're now dealing with a modern America.
[00:01:35.635 --> 00:01:45.044]  Speaking of Florida, a Florida boy accused of assault with a rubber band, 13-year-old suspended for 10 days after confrontation with teacher.
[00:01:46.653 --> 00:01:51.997]  And they're discussing charging him with assault because the rubber band landed on the desk.
[00:01:53.538 --> 00:02:01.183]  Now, certainly a lot of us would be in prison if shooting rubber bands in class was considered assault.
[00:02:02.644 --> 00:02:09.889]  And what he does need is to run around the football field 10 or 15 times until he's puking his guts up,
[00:02:10.575 --> 00:02:13.336]  And he won't shoot the rubber bands anymore in class.
[00:02:13.776 --> 00:02:28.379]  But instead, we'll just get him into probation so he can meet a lot of criminals, and then he'll probably end up with tattoos all over his body in a federal prison someday, building widgets for 15 cents an hour, taking all of our jobs.
[00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.100]  But hey, that's what the schools are designed to do.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.582]  Get you into prison, or get you onto Ritalin or Prozac, or get you onto welfare.
[00:02:37.662 --> 00:02:38.702]  It's all about
[00:02:40.732 --> 00:02:43.936]  Institutionalizing the entire society.
[00:02:44.496 --> 00:02:48.400]  Interesting little blurb or slip up in the Toronto Star.
[00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:50.382]  Headline, U.S.
[00:02:50.442 --> 00:02:54.206]  perplexed by Canadians on missile defense.
[00:02:55.708 --> 00:02:58.471]  And they've got the U.S.
[00:02:58.631 --> 00:03:00.873]  envoy here saying, we don't get it.
[00:03:02.215 --> 00:03:03.196]  And the envoy says...
[00:03:04.938 --> 00:03:10.202]  Well, I mean, it was a Canadian general in command of NORAD on 9-11.
[00:03:10.242 --> 00:03:11.823]  That's not really entirely true.
[00:03:12.143 --> 00:03:18.087]  Who wants the F-16s to, under Bush's orders, to shoot down Flight 93?
[00:03:19.828 --> 00:03:23.410]  So why don't they want to have our missile defense?
[00:03:24.171 --> 00:03:27.753]  We've had Rumsfeld twice say that they shot 93 down.
[00:03:29.294 --> 00:03:31.956]  We've had Rumsfeld once say a missile hit the Pentagon.
[00:03:33.267 --> 00:03:45.151]  I've seen multiple officials on TV, and I don't watch much TV over the years, slip up and say, and it's been picked up in the news that the government knew that a missile or missiles hit TWA Flight 800.
[00:03:46.872 --> 00:03:50.033]  So over and over again they say this and we're just supposed to ignore it.
[00:03:50.073 --> 00:03:56.775]  It's like when Larry Silverstein got up on PBS and said, we pulled the building.
[00:03:57.936 --> 00:03:58.716]  We pulled Building 7.
[00:04:00.157 --> 00:04:00.837]  And he says that
[00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:04.127]  And then we're all just supposed to glaze over it.
[00:04:06.108 --> 00:04:08.389]  Oh yeah, we gave the order and then watched the building come down.
[00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.510]  And he didn't go, oops, excuse me, that was a misstatement.
[00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:11.651]  No, that's what he said.
[00:04:13.772 --> 00:04:17.353]  So we'll go over this article as well.
[00:04:17.453 --> 00:04:19.815]  And here's an article out of the Chicago Sun-Times.
[00:04:20.535 --> 00:04:24.157]  They stopped the attempts.
[00:04:24.717 --> 00:04:28.399]  Obviously, they've cleaned the place out over a year ago.
[00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:29.559]  No trace found of 1,100 WTC...
[00:04:31.989 --> 00:04:37.891]  Victims, the medical examiner's office has largely ended its efforts to identify the remains of those killed at the World Trade Center.
[00:04:39.071 --> 00:04:40.212]  That's just some of what's coming up.
[00:04:40.232 --> 00:04:43.353]  There is so much here today.
[00:04:44.713 --> 00:04:46.534]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:47.294 --> 00:04:52.156]  Ladies and gentlemen, toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.

[00:04:54.376 --> 00:04:54.797]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.986 --> 00:05:04.929]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:06.892]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:07.092 --> 00:05:12.839]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:18.365]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:22.770]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.754]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:26.994 --> 00:05:31.658]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.738 --> 00:05:38.004]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:05:38.044 --> 00:05:39.866]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:05:40.346 --> 00:05:42.427]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.
[00:05:42.507 --> 00:05:46.790]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:05:58.077 --> 00:06:00.138]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:06:01.425 --> 00:06:02.086]  Hello, folks.

[00:07:03.638 --> 00:07:07.482]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:07:07.802 --> 00:07:08.623]  Read the labels.
[00:07:09.043 --> 00:07:13.167]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.387 --> 00:07:17.590]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.971 --> 00:07:22.835]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:23.215 --> 00:07:26.797]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.977 --> 00:07:32.319]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[00:08:02.358 --> 00:08:08.404]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.004 --> 00:08:11.987]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:16.019 --> 00:08:18.020]  All right, my friends, thank you for joining us.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:22.983]  We're dedicated to truth, justice, the American way, everything that's under attack today.
[00:08:23.003 --> 00:08:25.085]  The U.S.
[00:08:25.165 --> 00:08:34.250]  perplexed over Canadians' refusal to accept their missile defense system, that is, going under their control.
[00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:38.353]  And this is out of the Toronto Star today.
[00:08:38.453 --> 00:08:39.954]  Listen to this and listen carefully.
[00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:51.479]  Canada's apparent decision to stay out of a North American missile defense system has dumbfounded Americans as an unnecessary giveaway of sovereignty.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.901]  Look at the doublespeak there.
[00:08:53.381 --> 00:09:02.409]  Washington's envoy in Ottawa said today, We don't get it, said Paul Salucci, the U.S.
[00:09:02.589 --> 00:09:04.471]  envoy to Canada.
[00:09:05.532 --> 00:09:07.954]  Now, it goes on for a page and a half.
[00:09:08.556 --> 00:09:17.804]  Talking about NORAD and talking about the missile defense system and how Canada helps command NORAD from NORAD's base in Colorado.
[00:09:18.545 --> 00:09:24.530]  And then... Then Salucci says this, quote, Salucci compared the situation...
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:29.563]  To the one that occurred during the 911 terrorist attacks on the U.S.
[00:09:29.603 --> 00:09:36.848]  He noted that it was a Canadian general at NORAD who scrambled military jets under orders from U.S.
[00:09:37.188 --> 00:09:44.473]  President George W. Bush to shoot down a hijacked commercial aircraft headed for Washington.
[00:09:44.493 --> 00:09:46.555]  Now read that again.
[00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:48.702]  Salucci, the head U.S.
[00:09:48.802 --> 00:09:54.564]  envoy, compared the situation to the one that occurred during 9-1-1 terror attacks on the U.S.
[00:09:54.604 --> 00:10:01.987]  He noted that it was a Canadian general at NORAD who scrambled military jets under orders from U.S.
[00:10:02.027 --> 00:10:08.170]  President George W. Bush to shoot down a hijacked commercial aircraft headed for Washington.
[00:10:10.531 --> 00:10:15.193]  Now, Rumsfeld twice in press conferences has said they shot Flight 93 down.
[00:10:18.115 --> 00:10:21.276]  Rumsfeld has said in another press conference that a missile hit the Pentagon.
[00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:35.139]  But with the case of Flight 93, we have the state police saying jets were chasing it, there was an explosion up high in the air, the debris field was over eight miles.
[00:10:35.299 --> 00:10:40.000]  Now when you drive a plane down to the ground, the debris field might be a half a mile.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:46.941]  The plane supposedly impacted all in one piece.
[00:10:48.584 --> 00:10:50.326]  Into that Pennsylvania farmland.
[00:10:52.127 --> 00:11:01.415]  You're not going to have an engine eight miles away, and you're not going to have seats five miles away from that black mark that was in that field.
[00:11:04.037 --> 00:11:04.798]  It's just that simple.
[00:11:06.219 --> 00:11:14.746]  And then from our sources, and that matches with what the state police and the police and hundreds of other witnesses that they saw, it was shot down.
[00:11:16.488 --> 00:11:22.551]  And then from our internal sources, we learned that Cheney was ordering a stand down.
[00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:26.994]  Everybody knows Bush was reading a little goat story.
[00:11:27.014 --> 00:11:28.174]  He didn't order any shoot down.
[00:11:28.555 --> 00:11:29.455]  That it was Cheney.
[00:11:29.535 --> 00:11:32.717]  And that Cheney didn't order a shoot down and said the order still stands.
[00:11:33.717 --> 00:11:34.898]  We're not going to shoot that plane down.
[00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:44.183]  And that a general took matters into his own hands when the pilots are there with missiles locked and it's going to the Capitol and said take it out.
[00:11:45.996 --> 00:11:53.962]  Now, up until three months before that, the generals had the shoot-down orders in their control.
[00:11:55.183 --> 00:11:57.125]  Had the shoot-down orders in their hands.
[00:11:58.246 --> 00:11:59.847]  They were allowed to shoot planes down.
[00:12:00.467 --> 00:12:11.336]  Three months before, Donald Rumsfeld signed the document ordering the Pentagon, that they no longer have the authority to shoot planes down.
[00:12:14.628 --> 00:12:20.572]  So we've got to rely on the president, you know, whether he's off in China on a visit or Russia or Mexico, wherever.
[00:12:20.592 --> 00:12:27.737]  You know, four in the morning, we've got to first get him up, and then he's got to get up and go to a situation computer and be advised of what's happening.
[00:12:27.777 --> 00:12:29.038]  No, in the past they didn't do that.
[00:12:29.078 --> 00:12:35.922]  If a plane's in danger, whether he pressurized and everybody's dead on board and it's going to fly into a major city, shoot it down.
[00:12:36.763 --> 00:12:41.706]  Or if it's hijacked and they're screaming, Allah Akbar, we're going to kill you, you go ahead and you shoot it down.
[00:12:42.848 --> 00:12:44.329]  That's always been the policy.
[00:12:45.750 --> 00:12:47.932]  But no, they changed that three months before 9-11.
[00:12:50.653 --> 00:12:52.315]  And the Pentagon, that order's public.
[00:12:53.676 --> 00:12:56.578]  That order is on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:12:56.618 --> 00:13:10.247]  In fact, telling my producer at the radio show to call my webmaster, you call her and tell her, just type in to the website, shootdown order found, not shootdown order found, um,
[00:13:12.176 --> 00:13:14.017]  NORAD stand-down order found.
[00:13:14.878 --> 00:13:16.078]  And then it'll link through.
[00:13:16.118 --> 00:13:16.939]  You'll find a link.
[00:13:17.819 --> 00:13:19.801]  I'm telling this to the listeners, too, all at the same time.
[00:13:20.241 --> 00:13:21.462]  We'll find that story.
[00:13:22.142 --> 00:13:23.263]  She can call Paul Watson.
[00:13:23.443 --> 00:13:24.283]  My wife can't find it.
[00:13:25.664 --> 00:13:30.287]  And post this with this Toronto Star article.
[00:13:30.307 --> 00:13:31.327]  We need these two together.
[00:13:31.347 --> 00:13:34.329]  Kind of make a data page on this for folks.
[00:13:35.330 --> 00:13:40.633]  We'll just put it in our format and put comments and hyperlinks in it so people can
[00:13:41.275 --> 00:13:43.957]  Here I am directing the website from the air.
[00:13:43.997 --> 00:13:46.860]  That's how busy I am, folks, on air doing it.
[00:13:48.241 --> 00:13:50.123]  But this is the reality of what we're facing.
[00:13:52.245 --> 00:13:54.406]  And so they just keep slipping up.
[00:13:54.767 --> 00:13:59.811]  You know, we don't know why Canadians don't want to be part of this new missile defense system.
[00:13:59.871 --> 00:14:00.352]  I mean, why?
[00:14:00.392 --> 00:14:01.893]  They like having power, don't they?
[00:14:01.913 --> 00:14:04.355]  And having control over our military.
[00:14:04.435 --> 00:14:07.598]  I mean, it was a Canadian general who launched the F-16s to...
[00:14:09.426 --> 00:14:14.810]  Go intercept Flight 93 to shoot it down on its way to D.C.
[00:14:16.971 --> 00:14:21.954]  And the 9-11 Whitewash Commission does admit at least that that plane was going to the Capitol or the White House.
[00:14:24.776 --> 00:14:28.719]  Think of the power and control the globalists would have gotten if that plane wouldn't have been shot down.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.723]  But then so they could cover up the chain of events, how the plane was shot down,
[00:14:36.553 --> 00:14:50.098]  What happened with the shoot down of the plane, so it wouldn't track back to the Vice President saying, don't shoot it down in a general disregarding orders, they just concocted the story of, let's roll, Mr. Beamer.
[00:14:52.078 --> 00:14:53.319]  Let's roll!
[00:14:53.439 --> 00:15:00.861]  And then they went after the terrorist and drove the plane into the ground.
[00:15:01.361 --> 00:15:06.163]  Doesn't matter if all the police saw F-16s chasing it and the big explosion and
[00:15:06.866 --> 00:15:10.707]  Doesn't matter if public officials keep slipping up and saying that it was shot down.
[00:15:11.287 --> 00:15:12.547]  We're just going to ignore that.
[00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:17.208]  But here's the article out of the Toronto Star.
[00:15:18.108 --> 00:15:35.511]  Right now, up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, Washington had hoped Canada would go further and participate in building the Continental Defense Shield, an elaborate system that some would worry could lead to weapons in space and an international arms race.
[00:15:36.678 --> 00:15:44.824]  And it says, Salucci compared the situation to the one that occurred on 9-1-1 where terrorist attacks on the U.S.
[00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:50.328]  He noted that it was a Canadian general at NORAD who scrambled military jets under orders from U.S.
[00:15:50.368 --> 00:15:55.531]  President George W. Bush to shoot down a hijacked commercial aircraft headed for Washington.
[00:15:58.193 --> 00:15:58.654]  Really?
[00:15:58.674 --> 00:16:00.595]  I mean, this is two things.
[00:16:01.095 --> 00:16:04.378]  Now President Bush ordered this.
[00:16:05.338 --> 00:16:06.299]  Now that's just not true.
[00:16:08.092 --> 00:16:10.418]  For once, this is something they're telling the truth on.
[00:16:11.019 --> 00:16:15.671]  Bush was in a public venue, up on a podium, so we could all tune in and...
[00:16:16.391 --> 00:16:19.892]  We knew about it before he did, and see how the leader responded.
[00:16:20.112 --> 00:16:21.572]  We were all waiting on the leader.
[00:16:21.752 --> 00:16:22.693]  What is he going to do?
[00:16:22.713 --> 00:16:24.793]  He doesn't know.
[00:16:25.653 --> 00:16:28.734]  Building the momentum, building the suspense.
[00:16:28.914 --> 00:16:31.155]  Jerry Bruckheimer all over it, folks.
[00:16:31.815 --> 00:16:38.877]  Jerry Bruckheimer admittedly wrote the script for Saving Private Lynch, which she later admitted was a total fable, for days before the innocent Iraqis.
[00:16:38.897 --> 00:16:39.377]  We have her.
[00:16:39.437 --> 00:16:40.117]  We're helping her.
[00:16:40.697 --> 00:16:42.438]  The Republican Guard pulled out days ago.
[00:16:42.838 --> 00:16:43.638]  Okay, we're coming soon.
[00:16:44.716 --> 00:16:48.158]  Delta Force all gets advised how to hold the cameras, how to shoot it.
[00:16:48.458 --> 00:16:50.079]  The script is written by Bruckheimer.
[00:16:50.099 --> 00:16:52.501]  Well, the same thing with 9-11.
[00:16:52.621 --> 00:16:55.242]  I mean, it just has Hollywood written all over it.
[00:16:55.622 --> 00:16:56.763]  Just everything crafted.
[00:16:56.783 --> 00:16:59.665]  You know, one tower gets hit, all cameras aim at it.
[00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:01.606]  Then a few minutes later, another.
[00:17:01.646 --> 00:17:03.747]  Well, when everybody's tuned in, another one hits.
[00:17:03.827 --> 00:17:06.569]  And then they start blowing up and collapsing.
[00:17:06.629 --> 00:17:10.491]  And then it's just Hollywood!
[00:17:11.815 --> 00:17:14.617]  Yes, men in a cave did it all.
[00:17:15.217 --> 00:17:16.798]  They had Norad stand down.
[00:17:16.838 --> 00:17:18.840]  The CIA put options.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.361]  Insider trading.
[00:17:22.802 --> 00:17:23.463]  It's amazing.
[00:17:24.263 --> 00:17:26.384]  It's absolutely incredible.
[00:17:27.745 --> 00:17:30.687]  And here they are again.
[00:17:32.268 --> 00:17:33.649]  They can't even get their story straight.
[00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:35.310]  I mean, this is the envoy to Canada.
[00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:38.292]  Up there trying to sell them on going under this grid.
[00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:42.571]  And Canada being part of it.
[00:17:43.371 --> 00:17:44.972]  And they say, well, you were part of 9-11?
[00:17:44.992 --> 00:17:47.054]  I mean, you're part of NORAD?
[00:17:47.094 --> 00:17:48.234]  Why don't you go along?
[00:17:49.035 --> 00:17:54.398]  So Lucci compared the situation to one that occurred during the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the U.S.
[00:17:54.438 --> 00:18:00.682]  He noted that it was a Canadian general at NORAD who scrambled military jets under orders from U.S.
[00:18:00.742 --> 00:18:07.046]  President George W. Bush to shoot down a hijacked commercial aircraft headed for Washington.
[00:18:07.106 --> 00:18:10.508]  Now, to shoot it down?
[00:18:14.195 --> 00:18:15.816]  What do you mean to shoot it down?
[00:18:16.556 --> 00:18:17.997]  What do you mean President Bush ordered it?
[00:18:18.017 --> 00:18:29.081]  You mean Dick Cheney ordered them to do nothing, and a general did his duty and blew it out of the air and stopped you guys from getting total martial law.
[00:18:30.081 --> 00:18:37.664]  Can you imagine the Capitol in ruins with a big old passenger jet smacking right into the face of it?
[00:18:38.144 --> 00:18:39.245]  Can you imagine?
[00:18:42.532 --> 00:18:58.922]  That giant cruise missile following its GPS coordinates, flying that big old cruise missile, that big old passenger jet turned into a cruise missile, right into the front of the rotunda of the Capitol, right into the dome, shattering it, that image destroyed.
[00:18:58.942 --> 00:19:02.984]  That's why Jeb already had martial law declared two days before in Florida.
[00:19:05.105 --> 00:19:09.308]  They thought it was going to be just going all the way, but it was limited.
[00:19:10.123 --> 00:19:12.565]  They didn't get the full scope of what they planned.
[00:19:14.886 --> 00:19:19.170]  And a lot of that's because one of the planes got laid on the ground at the airport.
[00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:21.771]  It didn't do a perfect job.
[00:19:21.812 --> 00:19:22.812]  It was masterful.
[00:19:23.993 --> 00:19:25.874]  As you call it, quite a work of art.
[00:19:28.016 --> 00:19:29.597]  But it killed a lot of people.
[00:19:30.798 --> 00:19:32.299]  And now you're trying to kill America.
[00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:38.944]  9-11 is a stake you're trying to drive in to the brain of this country.
[00:19:40.037 --> 00:19:41.598]  And then turn us into your little slaves.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.901]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, we'll be back.
[00:19:47.161 --> 00:19:48.142]  We'll take your calls.
[00:19:48.162 --> 00:19:49.503]  There's a bunch of other news.
[00:19:49.523 --> 00:19:50.804]  There's just so much of it.
[00:19:50.824 --> 00:19:53.445]  A bunch of interesting emails as well.
[00:19:54.266 --> 00:19:55.466]  Hope you'll visit prisonplanet.tv.
[00:19:55.486 --> 00:19:55.546]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:20:01.252 --> 00:20:06.078]  This is Jeff Diamond, and we're talking to the creator of Right Size Smoothies, Steve Bostic.
[00:20:06.178 --> 00:20:09.322]  I just got off the phone with a woman who ordered Right Size last week.
[00:20:09.342 --> 00:20:14.007]  Her name is Joni, and she'd already lost 12 pounds in only seven days, and she was so excited.
[00:20:14.027 --> 00:20:17.832]  She said this is the first time that she's tried a weight loss product that actually worked for her.
[00:20:18.032 --> 00:20:22.736]  When you drink a right-sized smoothie, you feel like you're full, and that's what you're looking for, isn't it?
[00:20:22.796 --> 00:20:24.598]  We call it the Hunger Smashing Smoothie.
[00:20:24.638 --> 00:20:27.560]  We've developed a cutting-edge appetite manager called Apamine.
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:28.381]  It's in the smoothie.
[00:20:28.441 --> 00:20:29.462]  You drink the smoothie.
[00:20:29.622 --> 00:20:30.823]  It knocks out your appetite.
[00:20:30.863 --> 00:20:34.486]  It helps you burn more calories than you take in safely and without being hungry.
[00:20:34.526 --> 00:20:36.388]  And as you know, that's what leads to weight loss.
[00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:37.389]  It's a great product.
[00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:40.231]  And you're going to let people try this for free for two weeks.
[00:20:40.311 --> 00:20:43.453]  It's the best deal that anybody's ever offered on a weight loss product.
[00:20:43.473 --> 00:20:44.894]  You don't pay anything up front.
[00:20:44.914 --> 00:20:49.917]  You try the product free for two full weeks, see how it works for you, and either you lose the weight or you never pay for it.
[00:20:49.937 --> 00:20:50.357]  Call 1-888-223-2838.
[00:20:50.377 --> 00:20:50.477]  1-888-223-2838.
[00:20:50.497 --> 00:20:52.018]  That's 1-888-223-2838 for right size smoothies.
[00:20:52.038 --> 00:20:53.659]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:54.300]  The real money folks.
[00:21:10.057 --> 00:21:11.738]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:21:11.758 --> 00:21:12.798]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:13.858]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:21:13.978 --> 00:21:14.399]  A 5% increase.
[00:21:14.439 --> 00:21:16.880]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:18.740]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.241]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[00:21:20.261 --> 00:21:21.701]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:37.538 --> 00:21:38.819]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.448 --> 00:22:04.750]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:08.972]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:22:09.212 --> 00:22:11.994]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:22:12.194 --> 00:22:14.595]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:22:14.795 --> 00:22:23.440]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:24.961]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:22:25.161 --> 00:22:29.343]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:22:29.643 --> 00:22:31.364]  of the self-sterilizing filters.
[00:22:31.624 --> 00:22:43.569]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts, chemicals, herbicides, pesticides, organic solvents, foul tastes, odors, heavy metals, and nitrates.
[00:22:43.769 --> 00:22:50.351]  It is so powerful, it purifies raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[00:23:01.696 --> 00:23:04.138]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:04.858 --> 00:23:08.480]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[00:23:09.121 --> 00:23:13.023]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[00:23:13.703 --> 00:23:22.268]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:30.444]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[00:23:31.364 --> 00:23:39.488]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:40.589 --> 00:23:43.090]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.871]  That's 1-800...
[00:23:53.530 --> 00:23:53.910]  516-8736.
[00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:56.270]  Call now.
[00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:59.591]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:24:06.032 --> 00:24:07.953]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.453 --> 00:24:11.194]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:23.303 --> 00:24:24.884]  All right, welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:24.904 --> 00:24:28.325]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 800-259-9231.
[00:24:28.985 --> 00:24:31.446]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:24:33.927 --> 00:24:35.448]  What do you think about the U.S.
[00:24:35.568 --> 00:24:46.072]  envoy to Canada, Paul Salucci, telling them, yeah, well, it was the Canadian general who watched the F-16s to go shoot down the Flight 93 going to D.C., and Bush gave the order.
[00:24:47.132 --> 00:24:52.514]  They publicly say Bush never gave an order to shoot down an aircraft, which, in truth, is the truth.
[00:24:53.758 --> 00:24:54.958]  Oh, no, they'd never do that.
[00:24:56.119 --> 00:25:05.020]  But the interesting... But still, that contradicts their official story, and then it also contradicts their official story of these jets scrambled to go shoot that plane down.
[00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:07.981]  Very, very interesting.
[00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:12.102]  But it's nothing compared to Rumsfeld, the two times he said they shot 93 down.
[00:25:12.162 --> 00:25:13.462]  Oh, we shot 93 down!
[00:25:13.482 --> 00:25:16.243]  And he never goes back and says, Oh, I made a mistake.
[00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:17.283]  He just keeps talking.
[00:25:18.863 --> 00:25:20.724]  And the press just all sits there and ignores it.
[00:25:21.264 --> 00:25:22.024]  Speaking of the devil...
[00:25:23.274 --> 00:25:27.477]  I got a call from NPR yesterday, and they're going to interview me today.
[00:25:27.497 --> 00:25:29.279]  I don't know if it's going to be on today or tomorrow.
[00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:47.973]  It's going to be edited by one of their big national shows, and I'm going to be basically debating, but not on at the same time, with that Migas character over at Popular Mechanics who put together this sloppily done debunking.
[00:25:48.234 --> 00:25:52.437]  I mean, I can say I debunk that the sun comes up in the mornings.
[00:25:52.972 --> 00:25:54.513]  But it doesn't mean I debunked it.
[00:25:56.114 --> 00:25:57.335]  They do this so much.
[00:25:57.375 --> 00:25:58.796]  They build up these straw men.
[00:25:58.816 --> 00:26:03.620]  It's like the case of the CNN executive going, yeah, they're killing our reporters.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:09.064]  The Pentagon is... And then they go, where's your proof?
[00:26:09.084 --> 00:26:09.704]  Where's your proof?
[00:26:09.724 --> 00:26:14.888]  And then he resigns when it's all over the BBC and Reuters and the Associated Press.
[00:26:14.908 --> 00:26:22.093]  We have a huge section on Infowars.com right now where they admittedly, the troops admittedly in the Pentagon admittedly kills journalists.
[00:26:23.146 --> 00:26:25.427]  They said they would on the eve of the war.
[00:26:25.488 --> 00:26:26.728]  We have the Pentagon Statements.
[00:26:27.209 --> 00:26:27.909]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:26:28.169 --> 00:26:34.613]  The news just builds a straw man, says it isn't true, and then it's, quote, discredited in everyone's mind.
[00:26:36.434 --> 00:26:38.396]  They do this over and over again.
[00:26:38.696 --> 00:26:42.498]  And they told me I'll have about six minutes on NPR out of like a 20-minute interview.
[00:26:43.859 --> 00:26:48.642]  So if I don't have total focus and just say sound bites for six minutes,
[00:26:49.446 --> 00:26:49.846]  Minutes.
[00:26:50.486 --> 00:26:51.747]  Well, actually it'll be for 20 minutes.
[00:26:51.787 --> 00:26:59.270]  I have to basically repeat myself for 20 minutes so that there's no way that they can pull a scam on me.
[00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:01.771]  And then I'll just end up being probably a minute of the interview.
[00:27:02.772 --> 00:27:10.335]  Meaning if I'm able to totally control myself and only say things that they can't take out of context, will I be okay?
[00:27:12.956 --> 00:27:14.457]  And it's stressful.
[00:27:14.517 --> 00:27:15.277]  It's tiring.
[00:27:15.997 --> 00:27:17.878]  They don't play on a fair playing field.
[00:27:18.866 --> 00:27:19.786]  In fact, that's it.
[00:27:19.986 --> 00:27:29.248]  I already told my producers, and I know they called, I want Meejus or Magus or whatever his name is, I want him on here.
[00:27:29.268 --> 00:27:42.771]  And I'll give that creature who says we ought to all be ashamed of ourselves for besmirching the memory of those that died on 9-11 and their families for what we've said and done.
[00:27:42.791 --> 00:27:44.271]  I want him on.
[00:27:44.852 --> 00:27:46.632]  I want him on this broadcast.
[00:27:47.837 --> 00:27:50.339]  I want him on here, and I want him on now.
[00:27:50.819 --> 00:27:53.621]  And I want that punk on for an hour, two hours.
[00:27:53.901 --> 00:27:55.062]  He can have three hours.
[00:27:55.602 --> 00:27:57.563]  I can debunk everything he's saying.
[00:27:58.864 --> 00:28:04.327]  But I bet you, I'm not a betting man, but odds are he'll refuse.
[00:28:04.828 --> 00:28:05.508]  Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:28:05.528 --> 00:28:06.169]  Maybe he'll come on.
[00:28:08.843 --> 00:28:09.503]  He better do it.
[00:28:09.583 --> 00:28:12.405]  I gave his stupid magazine an interview, and you know what?
[00:28:12.485 --> 00:28:13.665]  I hate promoting it, too.
[00:28:14.085 --> 00:28:15.366]  It's a total waste of your time.
[00:28:15.746 --> 00:28:16.186]  You know what?
[00:28:16.486 --> 00:28:21.348]  The Warren Commission, all these whitewashing exercises, they all fail.
[00:28:22.629 --> 00:28:27.331]  Oh, the Warren Commission told us it was a conspiracy theory that there were more than one shooter.
[00:28:29.572 --> 00:28:33.653]  Now in major polls, 80% of Americans believe the government killed Kennedy.
[00:28:34.594 --> 00:28:36.275]  Up from 80% just a few years ago.
[00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:41.171]  So you can run, but you can't hide.
[00:28:41.871 --> 00:28:45.753]  And you can build straw men all day, all night.
[00:28:46.493 --> 00:28:49.454]  You can build them over and over again and knock them down.
[00:28:50.514 --> 00:28:58.197]  All that happens is people go find the real evidence and find out that you didn't knock down the real evidence because you can't knock it down and you'll never knock it down.
[00:28:59.437 --> 00:29:06.220]  There's so much evidence it'd be like trying to knock down the biggest forest on earth with a hatchet.
[00:29:08.215 --> 00:29:14.917]  Oh, you can go to some little rotten, rotten, rotten tree about two feet tall and cut it down.
[00:29:14.937 --> 00:29:17.018]  It's a tree you planted.
[00:29:17.038 --> 00:29:24.860]  But you can't cut down our forest of big, gigantic redwoods 50 feet around in diameter.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:27.721]  You woodpecker.
[00:29:29.201 --> 00:29:32.562]  Yeah, I'd be like a woodpecker trying to cut down an entire old-growth forest.
[00:29:33.262 --> 00:29:34.403]  Just keep pecking away.
[00:29:34.923 --> 00:29:35.363]  Ha-ha!
[00:29:36.147 --> 00:29:41.271]  We can see the desperateness in your columns, the articles you write in the Washington Post and everywhere else.
[00:29:42.252 --> 00:29:43.193]  They're taking over.
[00:29:43.213 --> 00:29:44.374]  There's armies of them.
[00:29:44.454 --> 00:29:45.675]  Everyone's believing them.
[00:29:45.995 --> 00:29:47.517]  That's right, because we got the facts.
[00:29:47.917 --> 00:29:48.598]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:52.641]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.121 --> 00:29:54.743]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.643 --> 00:29:58.326]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.505 --> 00:30:09.148]  If you're $10,000 in credit card debt or more and are making minimum monthly payments but getting nowhere, Debt Relief USA has the answer.

[00:31:01.428 --> 00:31:02.049]  We're good to go.
[00:31:23.133 --> 00:31:29.619]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[00:31:29.819 --> 00:31:34.904]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:31:35.024 --> 00:31:43.853]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.

[00:32:03.183 --> 00:32:08.668]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.089 --> 00:32:13.333]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.553 --> 00:32:20.600]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:27.106]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.226 --> 00:32:28.447]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:28.607 --> 00:32:29.088]  We're good to go.

[00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:48.790]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:48.810 --> 00:32:49.991]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:50.011 --> 00:32:50.251]  Call today.
[00:32:50.311 --> 00:32:50.531]  Whoa!
[00:33:25.635 --> 00:33:29.356]  Let me just briefly explain this again for those who don't understand.
[00:33:31.857 --> 00:33:49.202]  Rumsfeld, on June 1st of 2001, signed a memorandum and said that he was directed by the President and Vice President of the United States to order the Pentagon, NORAD, the military
[00:33:51.573 --> 00:34:06.483]  To tell them that they no longer had the authority to shoot down hijacked jets or planes that were going to be flown into buildings as weapons, or to shoot down errant aircraft where they depressurized and all aboard were dead.
[00:34:07.003 --> 00:34:10.105]  If the plane was going towards a city, they weren't allowed to shoot it down anymore.
[00:34:10.706 --> 00:34:16.309]  Since NORAD was set up in 57, they have that power to do that, and drilled routinely to do it.
[00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:19.371]  And if you're Cessna or Boeing 747...
[00:34:21.576 --> 00:34:39.705]  Or your Piper got off course, they would launch F-16s or F-18s or F-14s, normally F-16s are the continental interceptors, surround your aircraft and force you down at the nearest airport or military base if you'd gotten off course or come into their airspace, or they would shoot you down.
[00:34:41.706 --> 00:34:42.827]  Now that's policy.
[00:34:44.448 --> 00:34:51.191]  And Rumsfeld signed the order ordering the military that they no longer have the authority to shoot down aircraft.
[00:34:52.412 --> 00:34:53.513]  Now, that's one area.
[00:34:54.373 --> 00:35:00.176]  Then on 9-11, Dick Cheney was in command from the bunker under the White House.
[00:35:00.436 --> 00:35:05.519]  Later in the day, he then went to Site R in Maryland, on the Maryland-Virginia border.
[00:35:07.060 --> 00:35:11.042]  And he was there in control of NORAD and would not allow the shoot-downs.
[00:35:12.663 --> 00:35:18.366]  Then we get this article today out of the Toronto Starb,
[00:35:19.286 --> 00:35:22.168]  Where Paul Salucci, the head U.S.
[00:35:22.368 --> 00:35:34.274]  envoy to Canada and to their government, trying to get them to come underneath this new missile defense plan, and he says, hey, you're already part of NORAD.
[00:35:35.043 --> 00:35:39.946]  Salucci compared the situation to one that occurred during the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the U.S.
[00:35:39.986 --> 00:35:44.928]  He noted that it was a Canadian general at NORMAD who scrambled military jets under orders from U.S.
[00:35:44.968 --> 00:35:50.571]  President George W. Bush to shoot down a hijacked commercial aircraft headed for Washington.
[00:35:53.573 --> 00:35:56.334]  Now, did you shoot Flight 93 down, or didn't you?
[00:35:56.354 --> 00:36:01.237]  You know, that's one thing Popular Mechanics attacked us about.
[00:36:02.463 --> 00:36:05.145]  We comment on Rumsfeld saying twice they shot it down.
[00:36:06.787 --> 00:36:10.549]  We comment on Rumsfeld signing the order where the military couldn't shoot it down.
[00:36:11.630 --> 00:36:15.253]  We comment on the state police saying they saw it get shot down.
[00:36:16.293 --> 00:36:19.175]  And we say from our sources it was shot down.
[00:36:19.195 --> 00:36:22.118]  And we're called conspiracy theorists.
[00:36:22.538 --> 00:36:24.219]  I mean, I'm really trying to understand this.
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.263]  AP reporters were told to get back from the...
[00:36:31.676 --> 00:36:34.058]  Building 7, because it was going to be brought down.
[00:36:35.359 --> 00:36:36.480]  Now that's on the record.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:44.046]  And then Larry Silverstein gets up on TV and says, we gave the order to pull the building, gave the order and watched Building 7 come down.
[00:36:45.807 --> 00:36:57.055]  Now you look at the video on top of it, it's the classical demolition of the central column, or the crimp, being blown out so it falls in on itself and not outwards, damaging buildings literally 15 to 40 feet away.
[00:36:57.756 --> 00:37:00.318]  Right up next to it, weren't damaged to any extent.
[00:37:01.638 --> 00:37:03.620]  A few windows got knocked out.
[00:37:03.640 --> 00:37:05.541]  47-story building falls right next to you, nothing happens.
[00:37:05.901 --> 00:37:08.804]  But buildings way down the block fall and cause seven to fall.
[00:37:08.824 --> 00:37:09.324]  It's not true.
[00:37:10.065 --> 00:37:11.926]  All we're doing is pointing out reality.
[00:37:12.527 --> 00:37:17.751]  But in that hit piece for Popular Mechanics, they wouldn't... I'd like to talk about Silverstein.
[00:37:17.771 --> 00:37:19.032]  I'd like to talk about this AP article.
[00:37:19.092 --> 00:37:20.133]  No, we're not going there.
[00:37:20.573 --> 00:37:23.095]  We just want to know, did you see the bombs in the building?
[00:37:23.916 --> 00:37:24.777]  No, I wasn't there.
[00:37:24.797 --> 00:37:26.058]  I didn't see the bombs in the building.
[00:37:26.458 --> 00:37:27.519]  Silverstein says he blew it up.
[00:37:27.579 --> 00:37:28.640]  Well, we're not going there.
[00:37:29.989 --> 00:37:35.613]  Well, what about this article over here about seismographs saying that there were clear explosions?
[00:37:36.013 --> 00:37:40.316]  We called the seismologist, and they say they were never interviewed by you.
[00:37:41.537 --> 00:37:42.597]  And I go, excuse me?
[00:37:43.398 --> 00:37:44.959]  I go, hold on for a minute.
[00:37:44.999 --> 00:37:49.362]  I go online, and I go, the article you're talking about was written by American Free Press.
[00:37:52.063 --> 00:37:52.744]  And they go, oh.
[00:37:54.204 --> 00:37:55.505]  Yeah, that's another newspaper.
[00:37:56.246 --> 00:37:56.766]  There's a link.
[00:37:56.806 --> 00:37:59.288]  It says the author and a hyperlink to the story.
[00:38:00.088 --> 00:38:02.930]  You know how websites and newspapers carry other people's stuff?
[00:38:03.451 --> 00:38:06.192]  I go, did you call them and ask if they were interviewed by this guy?
[00:38:07.053 --> 00:38:07.393]  No.
[00:38:08.014 --> 00:38:08.674]  No, we didn't.
[00:38:10.395 --> 00:38:13.077]  Then the magazine comes out.
[00:38:14.238 --> 00:38:15.219]  They did something else.
[00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:16.800]  See, they didn't do that because I exposed them.
[00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:23.825]  So they weaseled over and found somebody who'd written an article for my site and a bunch of other sites who mentioned the American Free Press article.
[00:38:24.853 --> 00:38:30.154]  Clearly mentions that's where he got it, and they call the seismologist and say, did you talk to this guy?
[00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:32.195]  Oh, no, we didn't talk to the guy.
[00:38:32.215 --> 00:38:34.795]  Do you see how they do that?
[00:38:35.735 --> 00:38:36.055]  Man.
[00:38:38.356 --> 00:38:38.816]  Oh, boy.
[00:38:38.836 --> 00:38:39.856]  I mean, I'm sick of it.
[00:38:40.156 --> 00:38:41.697]  I'm really sick of it.
[00:38:43.837 --> 00:38:45.017]  But, again, they're going to lose.
[00:38:45.657 --> 00:38:46.398]  It's not going to work.
[00:38:46.678 --> 00:38:47.498]  There's nothing you can do.
[00:38:47.618 --> 00:38:49.918]  You can try to discredit until the cows come home.
[00:38:50.438 --> 00:38:51.779]  It's because of stuff like this.
[00:38:52.439 --> 00:38:52.979]  This is why...
[00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:57.292]  This is why you're losing your subscriptions.
[00:38:57.332 --> 00:38:59.073]  This is why all of you are falling apart.
[00:38:59.093 --> 00:39:09.637]  It's why the TV crowd admits they've lost upwards of 45% of their audience in the last five, six years.
[00:39:09.697 --> 00:39:11.398]  People just aren't watching you anymore.
[00:39:11.658 --> 00:39:13.079]  They aren't listening to you anymore.
[00:39:13.839 --> 00:39:14.619]  We're sick of it.
[00:39:18.261 --> 00:39:19.941]  Let's talk to Eleanor in Canada.
[00:39:20.001 --> 00:39:21.462]  Eleanor, welcome to the airwaves.
[00:39:22.202 --> 00:39:23.223]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:39:24.501 --> 00:39:30.003]  I was originally calling in with some very important information, life-saving information about Terri Schiavo.
[00:39:30.023 --> 00:39:31.323]  May I speak about that?
[00:39:32.363 --> 00:39:37.185]  Yes, we have Terri Schiavo's folks representing her coming on next hour.
[00:39:37.545 --> 00:39:50.889]  Yes, I've been in touch with them by email as well, but many people don't seem to understand that these judicial orders are only to have the feeding tube removed.
[00:39:51.601 --> 00:40:02.285]  The judge never has ordered, and never will order, never can order, that feeding be stopped, because that is a clear contravention of both federal and Florida law.
[00:40:02.325 --> 00:40:05.186]  Well, they won't let them for years feed her.
[00:40:05.266 --> 00:40:07.086]  She was eating Jell-O ten years ago.
[00:40:07.106 --> 00:40:13.108]  Alex, what I'm saying is that is contrary to the law, and that's not included in the order the judge handed down.
[00:40:13.128 --> 00:40:15.049]  Well, let me be specific with you.
[00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:17.270]  If they take the feeding tube away, she will die.
[00:40:17.630 --> 00:40:18.910]  No, she has to be fed.
[00:40:21.423 --> 00:40:24.486]  Well, ma'am, I've had her father and mother on.
[00:40:24.566 --> 00:40:25.747]  I've had her lawyers on.
[00:40:26.508 --> 00:40:29.711]  I've had the groups there, and for ten years they can't brush her teeth.
[00:40:29.731 --> 00:40:31.393]  They're not allowed to give her food.
[00:40:31.433 --> 00:40:32.694]  She can eat food.
[00:40:33.014 --> 00:40:35.837]  Alex, what I'm telling you is all that is felonious.
[00:40:35.957 --> 00:40:37.138]  Well, of course it's felonious.
[00:40:37.218 --> 00:40:40.341]  I mean, coast to coast they're killing people audibly begging for food.
[00:40:40.361 --> 00:40:41.322]  It's in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:40:41.502 --> 00:40:46.367]  What I'm pleading you and the listeners to understand is that the reason they're getting away with it
[00:40:47.006 --> 00:40:50.833]  Is that people don't read the actual order from the judge.
[00:40:50.974 --> 00:40:56.183]  The judge's order contains nothing about withholding... There's a previous order that they're not allowed...
[00:40:57.176 --> 00:41:04.077]  The guardian is Michael Cockroach Shivo, and he will not let them give her food.
[00:41:04.097 --> 00:41:06.398]  There are armed guards in there when the parents go in.
[00:41:06.538 --> 00:41:14.879]  Yes, but no one has the authority to withhold food in Florida, and there's a federal law called the Americans with Disabilities Act that explicitly prohibits that.
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.160]  I know, and they've argued that before the courts.
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.380]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:41:20.461 --> 00:41:21.761]  They're killing her, okay?
[00:41:22.341 --> 00:41:22.941]  They're killing her.
[00:41:23.695 --> 00:41:24.675]  And we're trying to stop it.
[00:41:24.836 --> 00:41:26.236]  Joni in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:41:26.296 --> 00:41:26.696]  Go ahead.
[00:41:26.836 --> 00:41:27.417]  Hi, Alex.
[00:41:27.477 --> 00:41:28.337]  I have a couple things.
[00:41:28.937 --> 00:41:31.378]  One real quick thing on C-SPAN this morning.
[00:41:32.579 --> 00:41:40.842]  They read just a snippet of a piece out of the Washington Post to do with some new orders coming out of the Pentagon.
[00:41:41.622 --> 00:41:48.645]  And I didn't take a whole lot of notes on it, but I think you ought to have a couple of your people research it out.
[00:41:48.825 --> 00:41:49.506]  Okay, what is it?
[00:41:49.586 --> 00:41:50.506]  Washington Post.
[00:41:51.223 --> 00:41:57.726]  Something to do with the Pentagon and an executive order about leaving our military people go into countries.
[00:41:57.746 --> 00:42:04.648]  In other words, it's not where we've declared any action, but like subversive, I guess, type stuff.
[00:42:05.529 --> 00:42:06.549]  You'll have to check it out.
[00:42:06.689 --> 00:42:17.013]  But the other reason I called you was last night I watched CNN and they had a segment of the program saying that Mother's Milk
[00:42:17.808 --> 00:42:19.809]  It's now being contaminated.
[00:42:19.909 --> 00:42:20.529]  Jet fuel.
[00:42:21.330 --> 00:42:24.931]  Well, with a chemical from rocket fuel.
[00:42:26.192 --> 00:42:27.653]  That's the way I got it.
[00:42:28.093 --> 00:42:29.673]  Rocket fuel.
[00:42:31.174 --> 00:42:32.975]  And it showed the state.
[00:42:33.335 --> 00:42:36.196]  Texas, Florida, I think California.
[00:42:36.677 --> 00:42:38.037]  It wasn't the heartland.
[00:42:39.318 --> 00:42:42.439]  It was sort of the border of our country.
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:46.001]  And that it's when the babies drink it.
[00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:50.366]  It's causing damage to the brain, retardation, and so forth.
[00:42:50.406 --> 00:42:52.988]  So we better not let mothers breastfeed anymore.
[00:42:53.008 --> 00:42:53.548]  Exactly.
[00:42:53.688 --> 00:43:00.892]  We better have them drink the soy milk that ends up with their brains being about 8% smaller.
[00:43:03.733 --> 00:43:08.156]  The brain needs fat to develop, and it's just more fear-mongering.
[00:43:08.196 --> 00:43:09.657]  People should just eat more organic.
[00:43:10.818 --> 00:43:12.639]  Not eat a lot of the processed garbage.
[00:43:12.659 --> 00:43:19.061]  Well, they claim that they were getting contaminated because of the water they were drinking.
[00:43:19.121 --> 00:43:21.201]  This chemical has gotten into the water supply.
[00:43:21.341 --> 00:43:21.802]  Well, it is.
[00:43:21.822 --> 00:43:24.342]  I mean, anybody that drinks tap water is completely insane.
[00:43:24.623 --> 00:43:35.406]  And then from the vegetables, and I understand from talking to a friend of mine a few months ago, they said that in Belle Glade, Florida, the lettuce and some of the other
[00:43:37.058 --> 00:43:45.381]  Well, look, there's always been toxins in our environment, just from volcanoes and other things like that.
[00:43:45.821 --> 00:43:47.881]  I mean, our bodies are designed to take a certain amount of it.
[00:43:47.901 --> 00:43:49.842]  That's why we need to limit it as much as possible.
[00:43:50.422 --> 00:43:53.543]  And 70% of our intake of these poisons is through water.
[00:43:53.563 --> 00:43:59.305]  And that's why if you cut out the tap water, you've really helped yourself and your family.
[00:43:59.605 --> 00:44:03.686]  That's why I promote high-quality, made-in-America water purifiers.
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:07.801]  Well, it was interesting, though, Alex.
[00:44:07.881 --> 00:44:18.403]  I followed through and I called my county, EPA, and the girl said to me, her question was, how did they segregate out the one chemical?
[00:44:19.683 --> 00:44:25.825]  You know, if it wasn't just rocket fuel, how did the one chemical get segmented out?
[00:44:25.845 --> 00:44:26.085]  I hear you.
[00:44:26.125 --> 00:44:26.865]  Thanks for the call, Joan.
[00:44:26.885 --> 00:44:27.585]  I appreciate it.
[00:44:28.601 --> 00:44:31.586]  Up next is Bobby in North Carolina.
[00:44:31.626 --> 00:44:32.067]  Go ahead.
[00:44:32.488 --> 00:44:33.089]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[00:44:33.149 --> 00:44:33.871]  I've got a couple things.
[00:44:33.991 --> 00:44:36.716]  One, I want to tell you first, I really appreciate what you're doing.
[00:44:36.756 --> 00:44:40.583]  You're really a hero in America here, and I really appreciate what you're doing for our country.
[00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.281]  I got two other things.
[00:44:42.481 --> 00:44:45.323]  One is, one side note, I got a question about Bush's second.
[00:44:45.763 --> 00:45:01.453]  The first one I got here is, a couple months ago, you were supposed to come on a local radio station in Raleigh, and we promoted real high for them to treat you with respect because a lot of times they clown some of the people like yourself, and they said that you were sick and that you couldn't make it.
[00:45:01.533 --> 00:45:02.774]  I wanted to know, was that true?
[00:45:03.334 --> 00:45:09.098]  Could you not make it, or was it something where it was a clear channel radio station, or was it that they didn't allow you to come on?
[00:45:09.665 --> 00:45:10.946]  No, I remember that.
[00:45:11.186 --> 00:45:16.951]  I cancel very few interviews, and I had real bad allergies.
[00:45:16.991 --> 00:45:18.432]  I think it was real early in the morning.
[00:45:19.052 --> 00:45:23.996]  My wife was saying, get up, go do the... In fact, I think I took off on the radio that day, this broadcast.
[00:45:24.016 --> 00:45:26.418]  Yeah, you did, actually.
[00:45:26.458 --> 00:45:28.440]  Now, do you plan on going back on that station?
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.041]  We would love to hear you here in Raleigh.
[00:45:30.061 --> 00:45:32.443]  They want to have me back on, but you can call and tell them.
[00:45:32.483 --> 00:45:35.505]  If you were listening that day, you can vouch that I wasn't on my own broadcast.
[00:45:36.626 --> 00:45:37.367]  I remember that.
[00:45:38.684 --> 00:45:40.545]  My wife's like, get up, get up, get up.
[00:45:40.585 --> 00:45:41.626]  And I'm like, I'm sick.
[00:45:42.186 --> 00:45:42.947]  I'm not getting up.
[00:45:43.207 --> 00:45:43.507]  Okay.
[00:45:43.867 --> 00:45:48.570]  The second thing I had about Bush is, could you elaborate a little bit on the Brownsville?
[00:45:48.611 --> 00:45:56.876]  Back in 1984, Bush with the satanic cult, the ritual, where supposedly everybody was killed except for Bush, and he was supposedly disappeared for three days.
[00:45:58.097 --> 00:45:58.877]  That was back in 1984.
[00:45:59.418 --> 00:46:00.918]  The city was right on the border of Mexico.
[00:46:01.919 --> 00:46:03.580]  And supposedly his father bailed him out of that.
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:04.681]  Can you elaborate any on that?
[00:46:05.481 --> 00:46:14.270]  Well, I've heard that, and it was in Texas Monthly, not mentioning Bush, but the massive satanic murders.
[00:46:15.171 --> 00:46:18.014]  I mean, they've dug up hundreds of bodies on the Texas border.
[00:46:19.193 --> 00:46:23.535]  And it's the entire Texas border with Mexico.
[00:46:24.096 --> 00:46:25.456]  There's just satanic cults.
[00:46:25.937 --> 00:46:26.837]  Folks, this isn't a joke.
[00:46:26.857 --> 00:46:30.339]  We're talking Dallas Morning News, Houston Chronicle, Texas Monthly.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:34.942]  They grab people's children when you go visiting over the border.
[00:46:35.382 --> 00:46:36.542]  They grab families.
[00:46:37.283 --> 00:46:38.203]  It's just horrible.
[00:46:38.984 --> 00:46:40.665]  And I had heard somehow that...
[00:46:42.734 --> 00:46:48.616]  Strangely enough, the junior was somehow involved, and it fits in with Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove and the rest of it.
[00:46:48.976 --> 00:46:50.397]  You know, it's like yesterday in Italy.
[00:46:50.437 --> 00:46:59.080]  They sentenced two Satanists who admittedly engaged in a bunch of ritual murders to life in prison, and it was a popular heavy metal rock band.
[00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:02.601]  I mean, this stuff's real, but you talk about it, people laugh at you.
[00:47:02.902 --> 00:47:03.102]  Yeah.
[00:47:03.402 --> 00:47:03.682]  All right.
[00:47:04.062 --> 00:47:04.502]  That's all I have.
[00:47:04.542 --> 00:47:05.142]  Appreciate it, Al.
[00:47:05.382 --> 00:47:05.683]  All right.
[00:47:05.723 --> 00:47:07.983]  I appreciate your call, Bobby.
[00:47:08.604 --> 00:47:09.084]  Yeah, that's...
[00:47:10.982 --> 00:47:13.483]  I don't have details of the specifics with Bush.
[00:47:14.524 --> 00:47:15.784]  That's the problem with all this.
[00:47:15.844 --> 00:47:16.965]  It's so wild.
[00:47:17.405 --> 00:47:25.429]  It's so, so weird that it just boggles the mind.
[00:47:25.549 --> 00:47:35.234]  But, yeah, it's... If I was you, I wouldn't get anywhere near, anywhere near certain areas on that Texas border.
[00:47:35.274 --> 00:47:38.716]  Down by Big Bend, the Boquillas Pass...
[00:47:40.764 --> 00:47:45.308]  And just a bunch of those towns, I mean, it is bad news.
[00:47:46.108 --> 00:47:54.114]  Strangely enough, I have, truth is stranger than fiction, my parents liked to go to Big Bend a lot when I was small.
[00:47:54.354 --> 00:48:05.582]  We'd rent an RV, go with another family down there, and we'd ride the little rowboats across to the Mexico border and go into those little towns.
[00:48:05.802 --> 00:48:09.165]  And, I mean, people were on donkeys, dirt floor shops.
[00:48:10.057 --> 00:48:13.199]  I mean, it was like something out of the 1800s.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:21.805]  And that's the very area that it came out years later where it was just organized mass devil worship.
[00:48:22.986 --> 00:48:33.873]  And tourists, young men, young women, families, they get you and they torture you to death and cut your heart out and hundreds of people.
[00:48:34.934 --> 00:48:38.276]  But Satanism doesn't exist and we should all just love our government.
[00:48:40.546 --> 00:48:45.269]  But Mexico is just rampant with Satanism.
[00:48:46.610 --> 00:48:51.834]  Just absolutely, absolutely rampant in the kidnapping, you name it.
[00:48:52.634 --> 00:49:05.383]  And so I would advise people, well yesterday we had the Associated Press about these former Special Forces troops from Mexico in Dallas and other areas murdering people and then burning their bodies up in their cars and
[00:49:08.346 --> 00:49:11.307]  I think there's several other articles today about Latin gangs.
[00:49:12.287 --> 00:49:16.208]  Just all over the country, how they target police officers.
[00:49:16.928 --> 00:49:22.270]  They just walk right up, randomly, as part of their initiations, and kill police.
[00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:27.531]  And then the cop gets killed, and strangely enough, when they kill a cop, it just gets in the newspaper.
[00:49:27.571 --> 00:49:29.371]  It's almost like it's a minor issue.
[00:49:29.391 --> 00:49:32.832]  And they're basically immune.
[00:49:33.553 --> 00:49:34.333]  These gangs...
[00:49:36.647 --> 00:49:45.690]  Because of these different laws that have been put into place, it's almost impossible to prosecute them, and they just go back to Mexico, and Mexico won't extradite them.
[00:49:47.450 --> 00:49:48.831]  And they're actually above the law.
[00:49:49.611 --> 00:49:51.692]  It's like the railway murderer.
[00:49:51.752 --> 00:50:03.976]  He killed over 15 people, and he's been in custody multiple times, but they don't know who their real names are, they don't know who they are, and they just let them go again, and he goes around murdering people.
[00:50:05.322 --> 00:50:06.263]  It's amazing.
[00:50:06.323 --> 00:50:11.967]  Every criminal in Latin America knows this is like the happy hunting ground or something.
[00:50:11.987 --> 00:50:14.449]  Just come up here and enjoy yourself.
[00:50:14.609 --> 00:50:22.756]  If anybody tries to defend themselves on the border from you, I will send in a sting operation of FBI agents to put you in prison.
[00:50:24.017 --> 00:50:25.118]  It's really that bad.
[00:50:26.779 --> 00:50:31.142]  It's all part of the plan to break down our borders, and when things get bad enough, we'll have a...
[00:50:32.595 --> 00:50:34.957]  Merger of our police and military, which is already starting to happen.
[00:50:34.977 --> 00:50:37.299]  The quote, deal with the threat.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:39.981]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:41.102 --> 00:50:42.883]  But truth is unbelievable, isn't it?
[00:50:42.903 --> 00:50:45.745]  All right, we'll come back and take more of your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:50:45.926 --> 00:50:57.715]  We've got an update for you on Terry Chivo Schindler on the other side as well.
[00:51:01.593 --> 00:51:05.916]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.116 --> 00:51:10.539]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.679 --> 00:51:15.042]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.

[00:51:18.223 --> 00:51:22.445]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[00:54:01.704 --> 00:54:03.885]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:54:04.466 --> 00:54:07.268]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.932 --> 00:54:14.553]  We'll go to Mike, Steve, Bart, and others here in just a few minutes.
[00:54:17.795 --> 00:54:32.022]  Before we go back to your calls and other important news items, help us expose the truth about 9-11, 9-11 being the foundation of all the other lies and the modern police state we're witnessing manifests itself in front of our very eyes.
[00:54:33.282 --> 00:54:39.245]  Get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, the preeminent 9-11 film that details the history of government-sponsored terrorism.
[00:54:40.481 --> 00:54:44.264]  The actual government plans to carry out 9-11 style attacks.
[00:54:46.385 --> 00:54:48.787]  Get 9-11 on the road to tyranny and make ten copies of it.
[00:54:48.807 --> 00:54:49.127]  It's easy.
[00:54:49.167 --> 00:54:50.568]  Get it on VHS or DVD.
[00:54:50.688 --> 00:54:51.528]  Make ten copies.
[00:54:51.568 --> 00:54:52.909]  Give them to friends, family, neighbors.
[00:54:52.929 --> 00:54:54.330]  Tell them to make copies.
[00:54:55.431 --> 00:55:05.178]  And if just two of the ten people you give it to make copies, if you do the math, if people continue to do that, you're going to look at one tape turning into thousands of tapes.
[00:55:05.258 --> 00:55:07.779]  And that's what's happened with other people that have done this.
[00:55:07.819 --> 00:55:08.640]  And I want to commend you.
[00:55:09.235 --> 00:55:10.536]  And that's why we're winning the fight.
[00:55:10.936 --> 00:55:15.780]  That's why in a CNN poll, 90% of Americans believe the government's covering up 9-11.
[00:55:16.681 --> 00:55:20.563]  That's why a Zogby poll showed that half of Americans believe that in New York.
[00:55:22.165 --> 00:55:23.806]  And believe they're involved.
[00:55:23.886 --> 00:55:26.628]  Even 68% believe they have prior knowledge.
[00:55:27.969 --> 00:55:29.430]  We're going to win this fight together.
[00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:34.754]  But you need to get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and part two of that film, The Masters of Terror, exposed.
[00:55:36.477 --> 00:55:38.979]  And you need to order them today.
[00:55:39.039 --> 00:55:51.667]  You need to get George Humphrey's excellent 9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati, a wonderful film, or Eric Huffschmidt's video, 9-11, Painful Deceptions, that we carry on VHS and DVD.
[00:55:52.507 --> 00:55:58.151]  When you get George Humphrey's DVD, you get three free color booklets, the accompanying book that goes along with it.
[00:55:59.227 --> 00:56:00.228]  So it's a great deal.
[00:56:00.648 --> 00:56:06.591]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order the films via the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[00:56:54.539 --> 00:56:56.220]  So go ahead and get your monthly or yearly subscription.
[00:56:56.778 --> 00:56:58.302]  Membership there to be able to do that.
[00:56:59.163 --> 00:57:00.707]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air.
[00:57:00.767 --> 00:57:01.248]  Go ahead.
[00:57:02.751 --> 00:57:03.333]  Welcome, Mike.
[00:57:05.487 --> 00:57:08.588]  All right, going once, going twice, Mike's gone.
[00:57:09.129 --> 00:57:11.210]  Steve in Ohio, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:57:11.450 --> 00:57:12.170]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:57:12.470 --> 00:57:12.730]  Good.
[00:57:13.050 --> 00:57:30.298]  Alex, real quick, on Boston Legal last Sunday, there was an episode that advocates torture, and in the case the... Everybody's been emailing me, is this the episode where they break his arm and he's innocent, but still they say Donald Rumsfeld's for torture, Alberto Gonzalez is good, and the court goes, yes, torture is good.
[00:57:30.478 --> 00:57:34.859]  Well, yeah, I have an audio piece that I'd like to play because I recorded the episode.
[00:57:34.879 --> 00:57:36.559]  I don't know if you'd need me to send it to you or not.
[00:57:36.759 --> 00:57:37.900]  Absolutely, please.
[00:57:37.940 --> 00:57:39.420]  Let me play this real quick.
[00:57:39.460 --> 00:57:41.060]  It's about 20-something seconds, okay?
[00:57:41.421 --> 00:57:42.401]  Yeah, jack it up for me.
[00:57:42.421 --> 00:57:46.702]  You held a press conference singing the praises of your officers, including Mr. Kirkland.
[00:57:47.242 --> 00:57:53.243]  Then, when the footage went out over the airwaves, suddenly my client's conduct became disgraceful.
[00:57:53.483 --> 00:57:56.364]  We have not ever and will not ever condone torture.
[00:57:57.995 --> 00:58:04.501]  Alan Dershowitz recently said that if we had a suspect in custody who knew that a bomb was about to go off and kill people, torture would be used.
[00:58:04.521 --> 00:58:05.362]  Do you disagree with that?
[00:58:05.462 --> 00:58:08.224]  We've never had such a ticking bomb case here, so I can't answer.
[00:58:08.564 --> 00:58:11.467]  Let's say we're trying to crack a big terrorist case.
[00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:15.030]  Say the Pan Am jet that went down in Lockerbie.
[00:58:15.371 --> 00:58:16.331]  Was torture used there?
[00:58:16.492 --> 00:58:18.093]  You'd have to ask the FBI.
[00:58:18.693 --> 00:58:22.457]  There were reports, I should say rumors, about the Lockerbie case.
[00:58:23.228 --> 00:58:26.130]  That electrical devices were attached to the prisoner's genitalia.
[00:58:26.190 --> 00:58:26.730]  Are you familiar?
[00:58:26.750 --> 00:58:27.231]  Objection!
[00:58:27.251 --> 00:58:30.073]  This court is not going to admit rumors, Ms.
[00:58:30.093 --> 00:58:30.413]  Schmidt.
[00:58:31.494 --> 00:58:32.815]  Let me ask you something, Captain.
[00:58:33.895 --> 00:58:36.958]  If they were tortured, do you care?
[00:58:36.978 --> 00:58:38.619]  Hear that?
[00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:41.180]  Uh, yes, sir.
[00:58:41.341 --> 00:58:42.021]  Is there any more?
[00:58:42.041 --> 00:58:42.722]  Uh, no.
[00:58:42.762 --> 00:58:45.183]  I got a whole thing of it, but I could play some clips later.
[00:58:45.203 --> 00:58:46.124]  I mean, if you want... I'll tell you what.
[00:58:46.164 --> 00:58:46.524]  Stay there.
[00:58:46.544 --> 00:58:48.986]  We got an update on Terry Schiavo coming up, then we'll get back to you.
[00:58:57.955 --> 00:58:58.596]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.276 --> 00:59:00.337]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.038 --> 00:59:02.138]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.779 --> 00:59:03.639]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:05.261]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.941 --> 00:59:09.604]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.124 --> 00:59:14.207]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.176 --> 00:59:33.584]  Every week or two, I'm sent a video of Threat Matrix or CSI Miami or 24, where they got somebody strapped down, blood pouring out of them in a torture chair.
[00:59:34.104 --> 00:59:36.886]  And the good guys hate to do it, but they got to for America.
[00:59:37.406 --> 00:59:42.609]  And they got shows in England where they torture people's children in front of them in the dramas.
[00:59:42.669 --> 00:59:43.510]  And it's good they do.
[00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:44.711]  It saves London.
[00:59:45.671 --> 00:59:46.212]  And they've got...
[00:59:47.586 --> 00:59:52.167]  These reality shows where people agree to be tortured at mock camps they've built in London.
[00:59:52.187 --> 00:59:55.128]  I mean, these are the type of shows on U.S.
[00:59:55.168 --> 00:59:56.028]  and British television.
[00:59:57.068 --> 00:59:59.269]  And I got a bunch of emails about some other U.S.
[00:59:59.309 --> 01:00:02.469]  TV show where they play out how torture's really good.
[01:00:02.529 --> 01:00:04.850]  And, well, you know, it's kind of needed.
[01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:06.990]  It's kind of needed.
[01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:08.551]  It's helpful.
[01:00:08.651 --> 01:00:12.071]  And Mike in Illinois was just talking about that with us.
[01:00:13.372 --> 01:00:14.152]  Mike, you still there?
[01:00:14.172 --> 01:00:15.332]  No, this is Steve.
[01:00:16.201 --> 01:00:17.642]  Okay, this is Stephen, Ohio.
[01:00:17.662 --> 01:00:17.982]  That's right.
[01:00:18.062 --> 01:00:19.002]  Mike wasn't there.
[01:00:19.463 --> 01:00:20.663]  Then we went to Stephen, Ohio.
[01:00:20.723 --> 01:00:22.124]  Yes, that's true.
[01:00:22.164 --> 01:00:24.745]  That's the problem with callers not being there when they're supposed to.
[01:00:24.765 --> 01:00:26.406]  But what did you think watching the show?
[01:00:26.426 --> 01:00:27.367]  Tell us about the show again.
[01:00:27.807 --> 01:00:36.611]  Well, basically, I was taping Desperate Housewives because I think it's a silly show, but I wanted to see the stupidity of the show so I can kind of judge where we're going in this country.
[01:00:37.051 --> 01:00:44.155]  And I happened to accidentally tape Boston Legal, so I watched it, and I saw this episode where it starts out, the cop is breaking the guy's arm,
[01:00:44.671 --> 01:00:56.438]  And of course, the moral dilemma is both attorneys feel bad about defending the guy, but in the end, they justify why it's a good thing to torture, because when a kid's life is at hand, it's better to let cops break arms, you know?
[01:00:57.023 --> 01:01:00.786]  And so it's really, it's a psychological mind game the way they do it.
[01:01:01.147 --> 01:01:05.771]  Well, have you seen the weekly report I did last week where we show them breaking pro-lifers' arms?
[01:01:06.051 --> 01:01:06.671]  No, I didn't.
[01:01:06.912 --> 01:01:07.492]  Admittedly.
[01:01:07.552 --> 01:01:20.944]  Oh, yeah, the video's up for free up on the website, and it shows them breaking people's arms for fun and spraying mason women's faces and babies' faces, and this is okay because these are evil pro-lifers.
[01:01:21.164 --> 01:01:21.725]  Well, you know what?
[01:01:21.765 --> 01:01:25.929]  You wonder where this is going, but hey, I've got another small clip to play.
[01:01:26.009 --> 01:01:26.729]  It's about 20 seconds.
[01:01:26.749 --> 01:01:27.350]  Yeah, play it.
[01:01:27.510 --> 01:01:28.051]  Play it for us.
[01:01:30.233 --> 01:01:30.953]  Here it is, folks.
[01:01:32.495 --> 01:01:33.336]  From this show.
[01:01:33.476 --> 01:01:36.599]  As Americans, we love torture.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.461]  We keep it to ourselves, of course.
[01:01:39.802 --> 01:01:43.745]  When it comes to evildoers, torture's okay.
[01:01:45.515 --> 01:01:46.716]  Hollywood certainly knows that.
[01:01:47.036 --> 01:01:52.241]  Dirty Harry, Charles Bronson in Death Wish, Denzel Washington in Man on Fire.
[01:01:52.641 --> 01:01:54.443]  Heroes torturing the bad guys.
[01:01:54.743 --> 01:01:57.705]  In theaters all across the country, we cheered.
[01:01:57.785 --> 01:01:58.646]  We liked torture.
[01:02:00.528 --> 01:02:01.849]  Is there potential for abuse?
[01:02:02.269 --> 01:02:03.070]  Without question.
[01:02:03.970 --> 01:02:07.233]  The events at Abu Ghraib Prison were deplorable.
[01:02:08.895 --> 01:02:11.697]  But do we really believe they just happened in a vacuum?
[01:02:14.222 --> 01:02:19.686]  Alberto Gonzalez, Attorney General, wrote a memo to the administration saying torture is okay.
[01:02:20.387 --> 01:02:25.991]  Our Supreme Court just recently held that evidence gained from torture can be used in trials.
[01:02:26.411 --> 01:02:34.017]  Alan Dershowitz, one of the leading civil rights activists in our country, raised the idea of using torture warrants.
[01:02:34.864 --> 01:02:36.785]  So at least to be more open about it.
[01:02:36.925 --> 01:02:37.965]  I could play more of it.
[01:02:37.985 --> 01:02:39.265]  I don't want to keep pulling up your line.
[01:02:39.325 --> 01:02:39.705]  Well, no.
[01:02:39.725 --> 01:02:40.166]  You know what?
[01:02:40.246 --> 01:02:42.286]  I want you to cue it back up to that first one.
[01:02:42.306 --> 01:02:43.287]  Then I want you to play that one.
[01:02:43.307 --> 01:02:45.107]  I want to play all of that when we get back.
[01:02:45.447 --> 01:02:46.147]  Okay, which one?
[01:02:46.167 --> 01:02:48.708]  You want me to cue it to the first section I played for you?
[01:02:48.908 --> 01:02:51.509]  Yeah, and then we'll put you back on hold, cue it up to the next one.
[01:02:51.529 --> 01:02:52.889]  You're doing a great job.
[01:02:52.969 --> 01:02:53.630]  All right, thank you, sir.
[01:02:53.650 --> 01:02:54.530]  Yeah, I'll put you on hold.
[01:02:54.690 --> 01:02:58.291]  Usually people turn it up too high or too low, and we can't do it.
[01:02:58.331 --> 01:03:00.192]  But you got it just right.
[01:03:01.152 --> 01:03:01.272]  And...
[01:03:02.907 --> 01:03:06.970]  Yeah, you know, really, I intend to try to make a documentary about propaganda in the media.
[01:03:08.170 --> 01:03:10.912]  A film I'll make after this new one's out, if I ever get it done.
[01:03:11.713 --> 01:03:12.913]  And I want to just show this.
[01:03:13.334 --> 01:03:15.155]  I mean, I've got a stack of videos.
[01:03:16.456 --> 01:03:17.356]  Much worse than this one.
[01:03:17.676 --> 01:03:20.678]  I mean, where they torture seven-year-old girls.
[01:03:21.759 --> 01:03:22.219]  Simulated.
[01:03:22.239 --> 01:03:23.000]  You know, it's TV.
[01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:24.761]  Mainstream TV.
[01:03:24.881 --> 01:03:25.401]  And it's good.
[01:03:25.441 --> 01:03:26.342]  They torture children.
[01:03:27.463 --> 01:03:31.345]  And what they're doing is nationally legitimizing it.
[01:03:32.119 --> 01:03:34.140]  Because they want to torture you real bad, folks.
[01:03:34.780 --> 01:03:40.002]  And I got footage in 1988 of them breaking pro-lifers' arms sitting on the sidewalk.
[01:03:40.082 --> 01:03:43.683]  I mean, taking nunchucks, breaking it on purpose, and laughing at them.
[01:03:43.743 --> 01:03:45.523]  I mean, arms just snapping.
[01:03:46.084 --> 01:03:48.324]  And the court said, yeah, you're allowed to break Christians' arms.
[01:03:49.185 --> 01:03:50.625]  Soon they'll be cutting our heads off.
[01:03:53.397 --> 01:03:54.939]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.119 --> 01:03:58.202]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.322 --> 01:04:02.226]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.266 --> 01:04:06.510]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:10.654]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.774 --> 01:04:12.576]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.796 --> 01:04:16.079]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:16.119 --> 01:04:20.822]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.983 --> 01:04:24.025]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:24.205 --> 01:04:27.067]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.568 --> 01:04:33.693]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.213 --> 01:04:36.315]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:04:53.562 --> 01:05:02.626]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:02.886 --> 01:05:14.112]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:19.274]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum,
[01:05:19.454 --> 01:05:19.954]  We're good to go.
[01:05:44.802 --> 01:05:50.747]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:52.028 --> 01:05:58.653]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregosin, Oregano, Oregomax, and the many under-health products from North American Urban Spice.
[01:05:59.014 --> 01:06:09.282]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Abstracts of wild oregano, notably the P7-3 oil, in particular the P7-3 Oregosin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[01:06:09.922 --> 01:06:11.403]  With a 100% kill.
[01:06:11.804 --> 01:06:16.527]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural urban spice products from North American Urban Spice.
[01:06:16.827 --> 01:06:20.990]  Call 877-817-9829 to order or ask for a free catalog.
[01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:30.017]  The oils, juices, and capsules manufactured by North American Urban Spice are from the finest raw materials in the world, which is why North American Urban Spice is recognized as the leader in natural herbal products.
[01:06:30.457 --> 01:06:35.601]  The herbal medicine has the exact frequency, the exact chemistry to kill any germ.
[01:06:36.161 --> 01:06:37.862]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:06:38.302 --> 01:06:43.144]  That's 877-817-9829 and start down the road to herbal health.
[01:06:43.464 --> 01:06:47.806]  Herbs and spices or doctors and drugs, the choice is yours.
[01:06:47.826 --> 01:06:51.147]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your North American herb and spice products today.
[01:06:53.569 --> 01:06:55.749]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:59.111]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.718 --> 01:07:15.605]  Alright, coming up in about 10 minutes, we're going to go back to Stephen Ohio, who's got these sickening clips off a TV show where they promote torture as a good American value.
[01:07:16.205 --> 01:07:18.727]  This is happening all over TV, everywhere.
[01:07:18.747 --> 01:07:25.992]  But right now, joining us is Randall Terry, and they're trying to save Terry Schindler's life.
[01:07:26.993 --> 01:07:34.498]  And this case, folks, it's just a horrible example of the culture of death, wanting to kill this woman.
[01:07:35.405 --> 01:07:37.166]  And she is fully conscious.
[01:07:37.207 --> 01:07:38.668]  She is not in a vegetative state.
[01:07:39.348 --> 01:07:41.109]  And they've ordered her feeding tube removed.
[01:07:41.149 --> 01:07:51.157]  This happened last year for eight, nine days of pure torture until Randall Terry and the family, the Schindlers that we've had on here many times, were able to get it reinserted.
[01:07:51.477 --> 01:07:53.779]  They were able to get a law passed in Florida.
[01:07:54.239 --> 01:08:00.223]  Mr. Terry, I know you're in a firestorm of media attention trying to fight this for her life.
[01:08:00.584 --> 01:08:01.625]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[01:08:01.645 --> 01:08:03.466]  Tell us just about your organization quickly.
[01:08:04.344 --> 01:08:06.505]  I am the president of the Society for Truth and Justice.
[01:08:07.185 --> 01:08:12.847]  We're an activist group who mobilizes people on key issues and gets the media out to cover it.
[01:08:12.947 --> 01:08:25.292]  And so all the media attention about Terry Schiavo that you saw in 2003 and that you're seeing again now, we've been like the Wizard of Oz, pulling the strings behind the curtain.
[01:08:27.319 --> 01:08:34.127]  Now, we can go to TerrysFight.org and look at how she's not... This is where we need you to go.
[01:08:34.727 --> 01:08:37.750]  Go to HelpTerry.com.
[01:08:38.972 --> 01:08:43.757]  Terry is with an I. At HelpTerry.com, there are several things.
[01:08:43.977 --> 01:08:48.302]  One is, there is a letter from Bob himself.
[01:08:49.071 --> 01:09:01.393]  And if people want to hear his heart, he's asking for prayer, he's asking people to take certain action, and he's asking for financial help for their foundation if people can help so that they have the funds to fight this.
[01:09:02.273 --> 01:09:10.695]  There is also the email address and the phone number of the Governor of Florida, the Speaker of the House, and the President of the Senate.
[01:09:10.935 --> 01:09:11.955]  Let me stop you right there.
[01:09:11.975 --> 01:09:13.035]  We're going to give all that out.
[01:09:13.435 --> 01:09:18.016]  But for those that just joined us, in a nutshell, Randall, tell us, for those that don't know...
[01:09:19.043 --> 01:09:20.164]  What's happening to her?
[01:09:20.544 --> 01:09:21.925]  What the judge's order is?
[01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.066]  Her state right now?
[01:09:25.467 --> 01:09:26.527]  Right now, she's fine.
[01:09:27.148 --> 01:09:27.928]  She's being fed.
[01:09:28.608 --> 01:09:34.892]  The Department of Children and Families, the Florida DCF, has formally intervened as of yesterday.
[01:09:35.992 --> 01:09:38.994]  We think and we hope that they're actually going to take custody of her.
[01:09:40.035 --> 01:09:46.678]  We don't know yet for sure, but if they do that, then Judge Greer, who has been on a track to kill her, his...
[01:09:49.361 --> 01:09:52.903]  His wishes will be ignored.
[01:09:53.183 --> 01:09:56.144]  And Judge Greer has not been a friend of the family.
[01:09:56.545 --> 01:10:03.348]  Thank God Jeb Bush, the governor, and the legislature, they are friends of the family.
[01:10:03.748 --> 01:10:09.731]  And the family is hoping and praying that the legislature and the governor will just continue to intervene on behalf of their daughter.
[01:10:13.433 --> 01:10:16.734]  So at this time... At this time she's okay.
[01:10:16.854 --> 01:10:18.455]  She might not be as of tomorrow.
[01:10:18.965 --> 01:10:20.225]  She might not be next week.
[01:10:20.706 --> 01:10:22.366]  It's a very fluid situation.
[01:10:24.567 --> 01:10:35.490]  Now, for those that don't know the whole story, under questionable circumstances, she went from being a happy, beautiful, fully functional young lady to being paralyzed from the neck down.
[01:10:35.810 --> 01:10:37.151]  She's not in a vegetative state.
[01:10:37.191 --> 01:10:38.471]  For years, the media has said that.
[01:10:38.911 --> 01:10:39.871]  I mean, she's wide awake.
[01:10:39.911 --> 01:10:40.672]  She smiles.
[01:10:40.692 --> 01:10:41.272]  She laughs.
[01:10:41.632 --> 01:10:46.494]  She's even been able to eat in the past, but Mr. Schiavo won't let them feed her...
[01:10:49.173 --> 01:10:54.617]  In the classical fashion, he got her settlement for her medical treatment and has been withholding this for years.
[01:10:55.078 --> 01:10:55.838]  That's correct.
[01:10:56.299 --> 01:11:02.904]  He actually had some kind of a bamboozled case where he won a bunch of money and said he needed it to rehabilitate her and care for her.
[01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:11.010]  And then he turned around and hired an attorney with that very money to kill her so that he could keep all the money.
[01:11:12.351 --> 01:11:13.092]  It's craziness.
[01:11:13.112 --> 01:11:14.273]  It's absolutely craziness.
[01:11:14.473 --> 01:11:17.155]  And the attorney for him is a man named George Philos.
[01:11:17.662 --> 01:11:22.643]  Who is an activist attorney, who has a right to die attorney, and he is just an evil man.
[01:11:26.404 --> 01:11:30.045]  This is a major precedent-setting case.
[01:11:30.125 --> 01:11:31.125]  Why is it so important?
[01:11:31.605 --> 01:11:42.268]  Yes, that is absolutely right, and that's why we're fighting so fiercely, because Terry, her life is in danger, but this paves the way for many other people who are severely disabled to be killed as well.
[01:11:42.788 --> 01:11:45.389]  And also, this has this...
[01:11:47.253 --> 01:11:51.174]  This stench of judicial activism all over it.
[01:11:51.794 --> 01:12:04.097]  As you know, most of the evils that have been thrown on our country, whether it's abortion, pornography, taking away the Ten Commandments, homosexual marriage, and a dozen other things, this stuff was not voted on by us.
[01:12:04.857 --> 01:12:07.857]  It was driven down our throats by the judiciary, by judges.
[01:12:08.337 --> 01:12:14.799]  And finally, we have a governor and a legislature that have the guts to stand up to these people.
[01:12:15.339 --> 01:12:15.519]  So...
[01:12:16.508 --> 01:12:21.230]  Let's just keep giving the support to the governor and to the legislature, calling on them to act.
[01:12:22.911 --> 01:12:31.535]  And again, if people want to go to HelpTerry.com, they can get more details, and I appreciate you guys giving out those details for the family and for Terry.
[01:12:32.455 --> 01:12:40.099]  Now, the Supreme Court just a few weeks ago said, go ahead and remove her feeding tube.
[01:12:41.740 --> 01:12:44.201]  What's the rundown of what's happened since then?
[01:12:45.225 --> 01:12:46.646]  You know, a short play-by-play.
[01:12:47.726 --> 01:12:56.149]  There are several motions before the court involving whether or not Terry as a Catholic would starve herself to death because the Pope said you cannot withhold food and water.
[01:12:57.690 --> 01:13:03.112]  There's the issue of whether or not he is fit to be the guardian because he's living with another woman and has children by her.
[01:13:03.152 --> 01:13:06.153]  So by definition, he has abandoned Terry legally.
[01:13:06.533 --> 01:13:08.694]  So how could he then be her guardian and have her killed?
[01:13:09.254 --> 01:13:11.355]  So these are the things that are on the table right now.
[01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:13.296]  Yeah, that's grounds for divorce right there.
[01:13:14.469 --> 01:13:15.810]  It is legal abandonment.
[01:13:16.270 --> 01:13:21.534]  So Terry has been legally abandoned, and yet she doesn't have the ability to get a divorce and have a new guardian.
[01:13:21.574 --> 01:13:22.235]  It's craziness.
[01:13:22.775 --> 01:13:26.879]  And he won't, for almost a decade, he won't let them brush your teeth.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.822]  He holds back all the medical care folks.
[01:13:31.523 --> 01:13:32.103]  Horrifying.
[01:13:33.304 --> 01:13:34.105]  I've got to run.
[01:13:34.145 --> 01:13:37.548]  I've got so many things going on here, but I'm so happy to be able to give you guys an update.
[01:13:37.628 --> 01:13:38.569]  Please keep praying.
[01:13:38.609 --> 01:13:40.030]  It's a very fluid situation.
[01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:41.171]  And if you hear...
[01:13:41.724 --> 01:13:44.145]  The Terry's feeding tube has, in fact, been removed.
[01:13:45.526 --> 01:13:52.530]  Then immediately get a plane, a train, or an automobile and come here to Florida and stand in vigil with her and the family.
[01:13:52.710 --> 01:13:54.631]  And finally, tell folks where you're located.
[01:13:55.732 --> 01:13:56.572]  We're in Florida right now.
[01:13:56.592 --> 01:13:57.033]  We're in St.
[01:13:57.053 --> 01:13:57.933]  Petersburg, Florida.
[01:13:58.113 --> 01:13:59.854]  It's actually Clearwater, right outside St.
[01:13:59.874 --> 01:14:00.074]  Pete.
[01:14:00.515 --> 01:14:02.216]  And where is Terry being held?
[01:14:03.776 --> 01:14:08.199]  In a little town called Pinellas Park at Woodside Hospice.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.441]  Woodside Hospice, Pinellas Park, Florida.
[01:14:12.822 --> 01:14:13.402]  Last question.
[01:14:13.422 --> 01:14:14.882]  I know you've got to go.
[01:14:14.982 --> 01:14:19.044]  When are we going to... I mean, she's got to stay now.
[01:14:19.064 --> 01:14:19.624]  We don't know.
[01:14:19.664 --> 01:14:20.244]  That's the problem.
[01:14:20.284 --> 01:14:22.725]  Tomorrow at 5 o'clock, the judge is going to issue an order.
[01:14:23.025 --> 01:14:24.486]  We don't know what that order will say.
[01:14:25.446 --> 01:14:25.726]  All right.
[01:14:25.786 --> 01:14:27.107]  Thank you for coming along with us, Randall.
[01:14:27.587 --> 01:14:27.987]  My pleasure.
[01:14:28.027 --> 01:14:28.407]  Take care.
[01:14:28.667 --> 01:14:29.168]  Take care.
[01:14:29.748 --> 01:14:30.308]  Amazing.
[01:14:31.128 --> 01:14:38.011]  Now, continuing with our discussion of dehumanization, Stephen Ohio called in talking about a particular...
[01:14:39.184 --> 01:14:45.910]  Okay, basically for the people that are just joining us, Boston Legal's episode on, I believe, February 20, 2005, last week, had an episode where they're
[01:15:02.899 --> 01:15:10.502]  And then I want to go back to that clip that you played earlier where they describe how our government says torture is good, so this is how we love torture.
[01:15:10.542 --> 01:15:10.822]  Yeah, hold on.
[01:15:10.842 --> 01:15:11.443]  Alright, here it is, folks.
[01:15:31.232 --> 01:15:31.772]  Just amazing.
[01:15:31.812 --> 01:15:32.653]  I knew he knew something.
[01:15:33.213 --> 01:15:34.754]  Either where his brother was or where the child was.
[01:15:34.774 --> 01:15:35.494]  He knew something.
[01:15:36.054 --> 01:15:38.255]  And you were prepared to beat it out of him?
[01:15:38.655 --> 01:15:40.336]  I was prepared to punch him, to intimidate him.
[01:15:40.756 --> 01:15:41.937]  I didn't actually mean to break his arm.
[01:15:42.477 --> 01:15:48.579]  But Mr. Kirkland, what we saw on that tape... There are different rules in kidnappings.
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:49.880]  What do you mean different rules?
[01:15:50.918 --> 01:15:54.221]  Well, the understanding is we're not supposed to break bones or cause any permanent injury.
[01:15:54.561 --> 01:15:56.022]  But physical discomfiture is permitted.
[01:15:56.623 --> 01:15:59.785]  It's okay to say dislocate his shoulder, tear a muscle.
[01:16:00.325 --> 01:16:02.087]  You're talking about torture.
[01:16:02.587 --> 01:16:03.548]  It was an innocent man.
[01:16:03.588 --> 01:16:05.389]  He wasn't even the suspected kidnapper.
[01:16:06.130 --> 01:16:07.030]  And I'm sorry I hurt him.
[01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:09.332]  But I felt he knew who his brother was.
[01:16:10.493 --> 01:16:13.115]  I considered this to be like self-defense, a defense of others.
[01:16:14.135 --> 01:16:15.977]  I was going to do whatever I could to save that boy.
[01:16:17.438 --> 01:16:18.659]  All I could think about was my own son.
[01:16:20.253 --> 01:16:21.653]  The end justifies the means.
[01:16:22.754 --> 01:16:23.854]  I guess I have to say yes to that.
[01:16:24.614 --> 01:16:27.915]  Suppose the suspected kidnapper had confessed to a priest.
[01:16:28.075 --> 01:16:31.015]  You'd feel no compunction about beating up clergy to get your information?
[01:16:31.255 --> 01:16:31.815]  I didn't say that.
[01:16:32.015 --> 01:16:33.236]  Well, is there a distinction?
[01:16:33.276 --> 01:16:37.036]  An innocent man has information that would lead to the recovery of a child.
[01:16:37.376 --> 01:16:39.137]  I guess I felt the victim here wasn't so innocent.
[01:16:39.417 --> 01:16:41.197]  Ah, so you're out there playing judge, too.
[01:16:41.377 --> 01:16:43.318]  Policeman, judge, executioner.
[01:16:43.338 --> 01:16:44.038]  Objection.
[01:16:44.058 --> 01:16:44.658]  Sustained.
[01:16:45.356 --> 01:16:51.718]  Who told you it was okay to tear muscles and dislocate shoulders in kidnapping situations?
[01:16:52.499 --> 01:16:53.439]  It's all formal directive.
[01:16:53.839 --> 01:16:54.519]  Just understood.
[01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:58.221]  Understood by the police who arrested you after you did it?
[01:16:58.641 --> 01:17:00.342]  I was arrested because the media got a hold of this.
[01:17:00.462 --> 01:17:01.482]  That's the only reason I'm here.
[01:17:02.362 --> 01:17:03.163]  How sad is that?
[01:17:03.863 --> 01:17:10.285]  You tortured an innocent man with no criminal record whose only offense was that his fugitive brother stopped at his house.
[01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:14.407]  And the only reason you're here is because the media got a hold of this.
[01:17:15.686 --> 01:17:16.106]  All right.
[01:17:16.406 --> 01:17:21.729]  But then by the end of this episode, if I get you right, he's found not guilty and it's all validated.
[01:17:21.929 --> 01:17:22.389]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:17:22.409 --> 01:17:23.430]  Did you play that whole clip?
[01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:25.150]  It sounds like you were talking while I was playing it.
[01:17:25.190 --> 01:17:27.411]  But basically what happened... No, I wasn't.
[01:17:27.451 --> 01:17:28.912]  The music came in and I just cut in.
[01:17:29.192 --> 01:17:29.692]  Okay, okay.
[01:17:29.712 --> 01:17:37.576]  I'm just going to tell you that basically what happens is the moral of the story is that in the end, they use the propaganda, if this were your kid, you would support torture too.
[01:17:38.076 --> 01:17:41.078]  And of course, obviously, a lot of people might feel that way.
[01:17:41.538 --> 01:17:42.078]  Here's the point.
[01:17:42.138 --> 01:17:43.859]  We have a criminal government
[01:17:44.739 --> 01:17:46.681]  Government has criminals in it, too.
[01:17:46.721 --> 01:17:48.782]  Do you want to give them this power?
[01:17:49.383 --> 01:18:01.193]  It's like an American citizen that was tortured in Saudi Arabia and convicted with the torture, and our government condones it, and they're saying they may ship other citizens to foreign countries for torture.
[01:18:01.974 --> 01:18:02.174]  Right.
[01:18:02.454 --> 01:18:03.235]  Well, I mean, you know what?
[01:18:03.255 --> 01:18:12.062]  They must have shadow scriptwriters, just like you have shadow government, because the scriptwriters that write these scripts never show their face in public because they're nothing but cowards.
[01:18:12.558 --> 01:18:16.922]  And, you know, it never ceases to amaze me the level to which these people will go to.
[01:18:16.982 --> 01:18:18.003]  Well, it's the same M.O.
[01:18:18.063 --> 01:18:18.863]  in every one of these shows.
[01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:24.368]  Look, supposedly, I think every cop show and every military and CIA-type show now, they do this.
[01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:29.653]  I mean, they even torture people's children in front of them, and they're training us that it's okay.
[01:18:29.673 --> 01:18:35.878]  And these cops who imprint off these shows think that's how they're supposed to behave, and either in the real world...
[01:18:37.027 --> 01:18:38.269]  It's just legitimizing it.
[01:18:38.289 --> 01:18:38.729]  Stay there.
[01:18:39.129 --> 01:18:43.394]  I want to play that other clip where they talk about how Americans love torture.
[01:18:43.494 --> 01:18:45.956]  It's as American as mom and apple pie.
[01:18:46.777 --> 01:18:48.178]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:18:48.218 --> 01:18:51.962]  PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.com, and more of your calls straight ahead.

[01:18:57.097 --> 01:18:59.959]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:00.199 --> 01:19:06.403]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[01:19:57.270 --> 01:20:02.434]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[01:20:03.346 --> 01:20:10.229]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[01:20:11.290 --> 01:20:19.874]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[01:20:20.974 --> 01:20:28.938]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.

[01:20:55.436 --> 01:20:59.739]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:21:00.140 --> 01:21:01.040]  It still is!
[01:21:01.641 --> 01:21:05.123]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:21:05.464 --> 01:21:07.245]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:21:07.825 --> 01:21:09.887]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:21:10.447 --> 01:21:12.449]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:21:12.849 --> 01:21:20.495]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.

[01:21:54.361 --> 01:21:55.522]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:55.802 --> 01:22:00.784]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:22:01.044 --> 01:22:03.645]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:03.845 --> 01:22:12.369]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:22:12.769 --> 01:22:21.214]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[01:22:43.786 --> 01:22:46.147]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:23:12.065 --> 01:23:18.230]  Let's go ahead and go back to Steve in Ohio, then we'll go to Bart, Joe, Harvey, Randall, and others.
[01:23:19.271 --> 01:23:21.293]  Steve, do you have that other clip you played earlier?
[01:23:21.313 --> 01:23:23.095]  Yeah, I can play that one again.
[01:23:23.155 --> 01:23:24.696]  In fact, I've got it queued up and ready to go.
[01:23:24.716 --> 01:23:25.157]  Do you want to hear it?
[01:23:25.557 --> 01:23:25.817]  Sure.
[01:23:26.037 --> 01:23:26.738]  Okay, here goes.
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:29.180]  Amazing.
[01:23:33.944 --> 01:23:37.668]  The truth is, as Americans, we love torture.
[01:23:38.979 --> 01:23:40.600]  We keep it to ourselves, of course, but come on.
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:44.943]  When it comes to evildoers, torture's okay.
[01:23:46.644 --> 01:23:47.865]  Hollywood certainly knows that.
[01:23:48.165 --> 01:23:49.266]  Dirty Harry, boom.
[01:23:49.906 --> 01:23:51.227]  Charles Bronson in Death Wish.
[01:23:51.747 --> 01:23:53.388]  Denzel Washington in Man on Fire.
[01:23:53.769 --> 01:23:55.570]  Heroes torturing the bad guys.
[01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:58.852]  In theaters all across the country, we cheered.
[01:23:58.932 --> 01:23:59.772]  We liked torture.
[01:24:01.674 --> 01:24:02.954]  Is there potential for abuse?
[01:24:03.415 --> 01:24:04.195]  Without question.
[01:24:05.116 --> 01:24:08.338]  The events at Avogadro Prison were deplorable.
[01:24:10.029 --> 01:24:12.871]  But do we really believe they just happened in a vacuum?
[01:24:15.353 --> 01:24:20.858]  Alberto Gonzalez, Attorney General, wrote a memo to the administration saying torture is okay.
[01:24:21.538 --> 01:24:27.142]  Our Supreme Court just recently held that evidence gained from torture can be used in trials.
[01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:35.169]  Alan Dershowitz, one of the leading civil rights activists in our country, raised the idea of using torture warrants.
[01:24:35.979 --> 01:24:39.040]  So as it leads to be more open about it, torture warrants.
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:40.040]  Love that torture.
[01:24:44.901 --> 01:24:48.382]  Mr. Preston talks about the victim here being an innocent man.
[01:24:48.562 --> 01:24:50.283]  Now come on, he wasn't that innocent.
[01:24:50.483 --> 01:24:54.104]  He did harbor a fugitive, one who kidnaps and kills children.
[01:24:55.444 --> 01:24:59.365]  He did have information that ultimately led to the rescue of the child here.
[01:24:59.865 --> 01:25:01.906]  And he refused to give it up until he was
[01:25:06.701 --> 01:25:15.363]  As for my client being above the law, well, the law in this country has always been subject to evolving community standards of humanity.
[01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:21.524]  So the 12 of you get to go back there as a community and ask yourselves, was this a good thing or not?
[01:25:24.085 --> 01:25:24.685]  He's happy.
[01:25:25.045 --> 01:25:25.645]  He's alive.
[01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:27.866]  There's yourself happy.
[01:25:30.326 --> 01:25:32.327]  My client saved a life.
[01:25:32.707 --> 01:25:33.827]  That little boy's life.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:41.303]  If it were your child, wouldn't you want the police to do whatever was necessary?
[01:25:42.943 --> 01:25:45.004]  This officer got the job done.
[01:25:45.945 --> 01:25:53.529]  Using a method that our government, our military, our Attorney General, and yes, even our Supreme Court has said is sometimes okay.
[01:25:53.909 --> 01:25:54.629]  Sometimes.
[01:25:54.929 --> 01:25:57.891]  Depending on the situation, torture's okay.
[01:25:58.992 --> 01:25:59.732]  Hear that?
[01:26:00.785 --> 01:26:02.066]  You've got to send me that tape.
[01:26:02.126 --> 01:26:03.466]  Well, I will send you the whole thing.
[01:26:03.526 --> 01:26:05.847]  I'll put it on a VHS, a high-standard quality.
[01:26:06.228 --> 01:26:11.230]  But it's filled with more propaganda than you can shake a stick.
[01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:25.437]  Well, look, we have the script for the show Spooks in England, where they torture a seven-year-old girl brutally and threaten to drop her off a building, but it's good because it saves them from the terrorists.
[01:26:25.937 --> 01:26:27.898]  And these shows, again, like Threat Matrix 24, CSI Miami...
[01:26:30.723 --> 01:26:34.024]  About a year ago, I went to see Open Range with my wife, that Kevin Costner movie.
[01:26:34.244 --> 01:26:34.464]  Right.
[01:26:34.984 --> 01:26:36.145]  And I don't watch a lot of TV.
[01:26:36.365 --> 01:26:39.065]  They had an ad for Threat Matrix on ABC.
[01:26:39.545 --> 01:26:43.547]  And it shows a guy in a high-tech black torture chair with lesions all over him.
[01:26:44.007 --> 01:26:45.947]  And the woman goes, I hate doing this.
[01:26:46.547 --> 01:26:50.869]  You know, and when they torture Winston in 1984, they hate doing it.
[01:26:50.889 --> 01:26:51.649]  It's for his own good.
[01:26:51.669 --> 01:26:55.370]  Yeah, they always use a psychological ploy that they hate doing it, but in the end, it's good.
[01:26:55.410 --> 01:26:55.830]  You know, it's
[01:26:56.070 --> 01:27:00.577]  Well, the point is, the point is, is that the government is the last group you want involved in torture.
[01:27:00.617 --> 01:27:10.631]  And certainly, what you don't want is the government condoning it, licensing it, training for it, promoting it, as they've done for 40 years at the School of America at Fort Benning, Georgia.
[01:27:10.871 --> 01:27:11.692]  But see, now...
[01:27:12.393 --> 01:27:13.094]  Yeah, they're studying...
[01:27:36.028 --> 01:27:40.053]  Listen, then I talk to people all the time, and it's come out in the news where they torture innocent people.
[01:27:40.093 --> 01:27:41.255]  Later, DNA shows they're innocent.
[01:27:41.495 --> 01:27:45.720]  Put a bag over their head until they sign and said they did it, and then send them to death row, folks.
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:51.788]  Yeah, but according to this clip, our Supreme Court upholds that if torture is used, it's evidence against the person.
[01:27:51.808 --> 01:27:52.008]  They did.
[01:27:52.611 --> 01:28:00.462]  Yeah, it's really... And Alberto Gonzalez said we can torture somebody until they die, and it's not torture, if we didn't mean to kill them.
[01:28:00.502 --> 01:28:07.673]  You know what I would recommend before I let you go is have everybody listening to you go to ABC.com and email them and tell them that you're disgusted with this clip.
[01:28:08.209 --> 01:28:09.990]  I mean, I don't care if there's 100 people listening.
[01:28:10.010 --> 01:28:13.513]  Just send an email and tell them, look, I'm tired of your propaganda.
[01:28:13.573 --> 01:28:15.194]  Sir, there's not 100 people listening.
[01:28:15.495 --> 01:28:15.895]  There's not?
[01:28:16.355 --> 01:28:22.660]  On one of our stations, say Kansas City, right now, there's probably conservatively 50,000 listening.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.240]  Super.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:31.046]  That's all the more power to send them the emails and start telling them, go to abc.com, and the very bottom is where you can email the show.
[01:28:32.247 --> 01:28:32.647]  All right.
[01:28:33.028 --> 01:28:34.108]  Listen, great job.
[01:28:34.148 --> 01:28:34.989]  Send me that tape, okay?
[01:28:35.029 --> 01:28:35.409]  All right.
[01:28:35.429 --> 01:28:35.930]  Thank you, sir.
[01:28:35.970 --> 01:28:37.391]  God bless you, Steve.
[01:28:38.217 --> 01:28:40.601]  I got some more comments on torture, and then we'll take your calls.
[01:28:44.047 --> 01:28:44.948]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.449 --> 01:28:47.052]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.973 --> 01:28:50.657]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.635 --> 01:29:00.159]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:29:00.299 --> 01:29:01.360]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:02.360]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.322]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:29:05.502 --> 01:29:10.406]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:29:10.626 --> 01:29:11.727]  Check out this new product.
[01:29:11.887 --> 01:29:14.769]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:29:15.149 --> 01:29:18.831]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.

[01:31:05.731 --> 01:31:17.859]  Lack of energy, lack of strength, lack of stamina, lack of sleep, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the husband, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[01:31:18.119 --> 01:31:21.962]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all of these things and more.

[01:31:54.565 --> 01:31:57.327]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.347 --> 01:32:01.189]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.331 --> 01:32:14.498]  I have video of peaceful environmental demonstrators walking a logging road.
[01:32:16.419 --> 01:32:23.023]  And instead of just taking a pair of bolt cutters and cutting the chains that they've tied themselves together with,
[01:32:23.951 --> 01:32:33.158]  Oh no, they want to torture, so they take bottles of mace and pepper spray, pry open their eyes, and start jamming it into their eyeballs.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:45.807]  And I have video of families in Portland, Oregon, and they're out there demonstrating when Bush came to town, and then they just go after the peaceful crowd, fire at them with rubber bullets.
[01:32:47.210 --> 01:32:49.351]  Blasting big bloody holes in them an inch deep.
[01:32:49.911 --> 01:32:53.152]  They run right up to families, spray pepper spray right in a two-year-old's face.
[01:32:53.212 --> 01:32:54.013]  The parents cry.
[01:32:54.333 --> 01:32:55.153]  Why are you doing this?
[01:32:55.553 --> 01:32:58.695]  Shouldn't bring a child to a protest, bleeper!
[01:32:58.735 --> 01:33:00.575]  You know, bloop!
[01:33:01.816 --> 01:33:02.796]  This is what they do.
[01:33:02.956 --> 01:33:05.577]  And I've got video from the early 80s, mid-90s.
[01:33:05.657 --> 01:33:09.979]  Pro-lifers locking arms in front of abortion clinics.
[01:33:10.899 --> 01:33:14.521]  And they walk right over with nunchucks, and the federal courts ruled they could do this,
[01:33:15.297 --> 01:33:20.201]  Wrap them around a priest or a pastor's arm or a woman's arm and they just twist and you see the arm break.
[01:33:20.982 --> 01:33:23.584]  And these crowds just cheer, yeah!
[01:33:24.685 --> 01:33:26.987]  And then, it's a lot worse than that.
[01:33:27.027 --> 01:33:30.210]  I mean, the video I've got, we posted it at prisonplanet.com.
[01:33:31.671 --> 01:33:32.932]  It's up there for everybody to see.
[01:33:34.393 --> 01:33:36.855]  Right now, prisonplanet.tv as well.
[01:33:39.237 --> 01:33:40.939]  And they don't call it torture, they call it pressure.
[01:33:40.959 --> 01:33:43.061]  Well, you shouldn't make us carry you
[01:33:44.351 --> 01:33:48.955]  To the wagons, the paddy wagons.
[01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:51.658]  So we're going to break your arm.
[01:33:52.298 --> 01:33:53.299]  And there's nothing you can do.
[01:33:53.319 --> 01:33:56.242]  The courts were saying in the late 80s you could do this.
[01:33:57.273 --> 01:33:59.874]  I mean, the courts said black people weren't human beings before, too.
[01:33:59.934 --> 01:34:02.194]  The courts have said that women don't have a right to vote.
[01:34:02.554 --> 01:34:04.515]  The courts have said you have no right to private property.
[01:34:04.535 --> 01:34:07.556]  And now all over the country, cities are going into whole neighborhoods.
[01:34:07.596 --> 01:34:09.216]  It doesn't matter if they're nice little class homes.
[01:34:09.236 --> 01:34:14.938]  They go, we're just taking them and we're not even giving you fair value for them because some developers want this to build bigger houses.
[01:34:15.978 --> 01:34:16.578]  That's happening.
[01:34:16.598 --> 01:34:18.959]  I got the USA Today here in front of me.
[01:34:18.979 --> 01:34:21.499]  Like, I need to cover that today.
[01:34:21.799 --> 01:34:23.600]  Didn't really get to it in any detail yesterday.
[01:34:25.347 --> 01:34:26.608]  You're like, what does this have to do with torture?
[01:34:26.688 --> 01:34:29.109]  It's just wild, out of control.
[01:34:29.449 --> 01:34:35.973]  The last group you want, the most dangerous group to your liberty and your freedom and your security, has always been out of control government.
[01:34:37.433 --> 01:34:42.616]  The Nazis tortured, the Soviets tortured, the Cubans tortured, the North Vietnamese tortured.
[01:34:44.597 --> 01:34:46.018]  It is so un-American.
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:49.540]  It's upon us.
[01:34:50.061 --> 01:34:55.724]  And they're using these little mind games of, well, if there was a bomb going to go off in Baghdad, shouldn't we be able to torture people?
[01:34:57.544 --> 01:35:01.426]  You know, if a nuke's going to go off in New York, shouldn't we be able to torture people?
[01:35:01.486 --> 01:35:04.108]  Or if it's terror-related, shouldn't we be able to torture?
[01:35:04.128 --> 01:35:08.210]  And now the headlines, having marijuana as an act of terrorism.
[01:35:08.230 --> 01:35:13.913]  The new drug czar says, selling a knock-off Rubik's Cube that may be a copyright infringement.
[01:35:13.933 --> 01:35:14.653]  Turned out it wasn't.
[01:35:15.013 --> 01:35:16.214]  Maybe terrorism.
[01:35:17.944 --> 01:35:23.205]  Not paying your taxes doesn't allow the government to get the funds it needs to fight terror and aid terrorists.
[01:35:23.225 --> 01:35:24.246]  That'll be terrorism.
[01:35:25.166 --> 01:35:27.627]  Protesting the war aids terrorists.
[01:35:27.687 --> 01:35:36.229]  And so, the Attorney General, Deputy Attorney General Calhoun of California said last year, we may ban protest, period, because it aids terrorists.
[01:35:36.249 --> 01:35:36.889]  That's a Democrat.
[01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:46.532]  Tony Blakely, Washington Times editorial editor, says let's arrest Seymour Hersh and let's execute him.
[01:35:47.239 --> 01:35:48.199]  Well, here's the U.S.
[01:35:48.259 --> 01:35:48.619]  code.
[01:35:48.659 --> 01:35:51.040]  Let's kill this Pulitzer Prize winning reporter.
[01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.900]  He's aiding terrorists.
[01:35:55.801 --> 01:35:57.201]  On and on and on.
[01:35:57.241 --> 01:36:00.642]  Let's put Americans in forced labor camps if they disagree with the government.
[01:36:00.882 --> 01:36:02.202]  Because they're aiding terrorists.
[01:36:02.282 --> 01:36:03.422]  Michael Weiner says that.
[01:36:05.482 --> 01:36:07.763]  Over and over and over and over again.
[01:36:07.803 --> 01:36:08.783]  It's just everywhere.
[01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:13.944]  I mean, Time Magazine, Newsweek, USA Today, Washington Times.
[01:36:15.013 --> 01:36:18.617]  Over and over again, Alan Dershowitz travels the country, came to Austin, gave a speech.
[01:36:18.657 --> 01:36:20.438]  I didn't go to it, but I saw the video of the speech.
[01:36:20.919 --> 01:36:22.320]  All about how torture is good.
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:24.882]  We need to incorporate torture into American life.
[01:36:25.103 --> 01:36:26.103]  You heard that clip earlier.
[01:36:26.404 --> 01:36:28.986]  Torture is really a good new moral value.
[01:36:29.346 --> 01:36:31.568]  Our moral values have evolved and gotten better.
[01:36:32.209 --> 01:36:34.271]  And so now we're going to start torturing people.
[01:36:38.613 --> 01:36:42.074]  And a lot of so-called Christian conservatives go, yeah, torture them Muslims.
[01:36:42.094 --> 01:36:42.674]  They're animals.
[01:36:42.734 --> 01:36:44.915]  What you don't know is FEMA's training for you.
[01:36:45.695 --> 01:36:54.038]  All the real training, I mean 90% of it, is for homeschoolers and Christians and pro-lifers and land rights activists and Second Amendment demonstrators.
[01:36:54.738 --> 01:36:57.399]  And they're just training the police that, oh, it's not pressure.
[01:36:58.639 --> 01:37:06.182]  I guess shooting somebody with rubber bullets 10 feet away and blowing their eye out and pushing it back into their brain and the young lady drops dead and dies.
[01:37:08.504 --> 01:37:09.986]  That's okay, they said.
[01:37:10.026 --> 01:37:10.666]  They killed her.
[01:37:10.726 --> 01:37:11.167]  So what?
[01:37:11.187 --> 01:37:11.867]  She's dead.
[01:37:12.988 --> 01:37:13.529]  She's dead.
[01:37:13.549 --> 01:37:14.710]  She shouldn't have been out on the street.
[01:37:16.212 --> 01:37:18.354]  You know how it is.
[01:37:20.035 --> 01:37:21.136]  And that's all any of this is.
[01:37:21.176 --> 01:37:30.485]  I mean, if you think black ski masks and black uniforms and armored vehicles and cameras everywhere in the news saying torture's good, I mean, if you really think that's freedom, the new morals, oh, it's like new freedom.
[01:37:30.585 --> 01:37:33.108]  We have a new freedom to forcibly psychologically test you.
[01:37:33.772 --> 01:37:36.033]  We have the Patriot Act.
[01:37:36.093 --> 01:37:37.853]  It's all patriotic.
[01:37:37.893 --> 01:37:39.594]  Why, it says patriot, it must be.
[01:37:42.615 --> 01:37:43.535]  It's like all of this.
[01:37:46.076 --> 01:37:52.579]  Oh, we were brought up, the Nazis were bad, the Soviets were bad, because they tortured, and now, now, no, no, no, it was good.
[01:37:54.259 --> 01:37:54.819]  It was good.
[01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:59.101]  Of course, the Army's own report says that they sodomized people with
[01:38:00.333 --> 01:38:02.313]  Large objects dripping with battery acid.
[01:38:02.353 --> 01:38:03.794]  That's the General Tugumbu Report.
[01:38:03.994 --> 01:38:06.054]  Just type in General Tugumbu Report, MSNBC.
[01:38:06.594 --> 01:38:07.675]  And he said, yeah, they've confessed.
[01:38:07.715 --> 01:38:08.015]  It's true.
[01:38:08.035 --> 01:38:09.115]  And they said they were ordered to do it.
[01:38:09.155 --> 01:38:11.255]  And that was a CIA operation.
[01:38:11.295 --> 01:38:14.396]  And they would bring a wife in.
[01:38:14.496 --> 01:38:19.297]  They'd pick up a family at a checkpoint and think the man might be a terrorist.
[01:38:19.337 --> 01:38:21.838]  And so they'd just take his wife in in front of them and rape her.
[01:38:23.118 --> 01:38:23.978]  Same to the children.
[01:38:24.078 --> 01:38:25.078]  It's just freedom, folks.
[01:38:25.138 --> 01:38:25.599]  It's freedom.
[01:38:25.619 --> 01:38:27.219]  Freedom.
[01:38:27.239 --> 01:38:27.499]  Freedom.
[01:38:28.755 --> 01:38:29.435]  I don't think it's freedom.
[01:38:29.455 --> 01:38:30.196]  I think it's pure evil.
[01:38:30.636 --> 01:38:50.083]  And then the other Army report, this will be in my new film, by the way, the new Army report, came out and said, well, 75 to 90 percent of those that are in the 32 camps, some of the camps have over 20,000 people in them, 75 to 90 percent are completely innocent of anything.
[01:38:50.523 --> 01:38:53.204]  They're just picked up at the checkpoints.
[01:38:53.865 --> 01:38:54.925]  And they're taken to the camps.
[01:38:55.652 --> 01:39:21.415]  Where every sicko federal prison guard who ever loved abuse, this goes on in our prisons too, gets to go over there and it is the Jeffrey Dahmers, the John Wayne Gacy's, the Ted Bundy's of the world, go over there and bite, this has happened, bite chunks out of people, have dogs bite their body parts, and then sew them up with no deadening,
[01:39:22.412 --> 01:39:26.033]  And laugh about it and hold thumbs up over bodies they've beaten to death?
[01:39:26.253 --> 01:39:29.595]  Then they pack them in ice and take them out and their organs are cut out and sold?
[01:39:29.635 --> 01:39:30.415]  That's now admitted?
[01:39:32.716 --> 01:39:34.016]  You think that's good, huh?
[01:39:35.097 --> 01:39:36.417]  You see, that's how torture works.
[01:39:36.477 --> 01:39:40.899]  It isn't just the one little case of, well, there's a bomb going to go off and we have to torture her.
[01:39:40.919 --> 01:39:42.099]  They won't tell us.
[01:39:42.259 --> 01:39:45.741]  Well, what if a child was kidnapped and we had the person and we had to know?
[01:39:46.181 --> 01:39:47.221]  Isn't torture good?
[01:39:47.241 --> 01:39:49.142]  You know, to find out answers?
[01:39:49.382 --> 01:39:51.503]  Well, see, that'll be the excuse in every case.
[01:39:52.742 --> 01:39:53.863]  It'll be used system-wide.
[01:39:54.083 --> 01:39:57.465]  They'll have all these special torture officers, which they admit they've trained.
[01:39:59.406 --> 01:40:18.239]  You know, it's funny, the Padilla case, not the Padilla that's the supposed hijacker, but the other Padilla, the black man, they were at a bar, somebody bumped into a cop during a scuffle,
[01:40:19.617 --> 01:40:22.358]  And the police thought it was this one guy.
[01:40:22.398 --> 01:40:24.898]  Later, they admitted it was somebody else because cameras picked it up.
[01:40:25.518 --> 01:40:34.580]  And so they just took him down to the precinct and for two hours... Well, you know what they did with a three-foot broomstick.
[01:40:34.980 --> 01:40:38.801]  The man had internal bleeding all the way into his upper intestine.
[01:40:40.841 --> 01:40:43.742]  Actually, I don't want to go any further, folks.
[01:40:46.642 --> 01:40:49.203]  Just the most savage, demonic...
[01:40:49.975 --> 01:41:06.405]  It's like this demonic family that needs to be tried as quickly as possible and executed in Houston with the eight-month-old baby being so brutally raped that almost all the internal organs are shutting down.
[01:41:07.285 --> 01:41:09.326]  They need to kill those people immediately.
[01:41:10.567 --> 01:41:11.387]  And you know what, though?
[01:41:11.407 --> 01:41:14.149]  The founding fathers said, after the good trial,
[01:41:14.747 --> 01:41:20.430]  The Founding Fathers said you don't even torture those people, though, because you will become them the minute you torture.
[01:41:22.211 --> 01:41:30.055]  So this sexual abuse stuff, I mean, that's what a lot of times cops in this country, when they get caught torturing, it's sexual.
[01:41:30.775 --> 01:41:35.738]  At Gitmo and Abu Ghraib, it's sexual in nature.
[01:41:36.298 --> 01:41:39.600]  Because in almost every case, study criminology.
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:43.262]  I took one course in it in college, but I've read a lot of books on criminology.
[01:41:44.565 --> 01:41:45.725]  The textbook type books.
[01:41:45.785 --> 01:41:49.746]  I don't waste my time on the crime story ones and true story crime stuff.
[01:41:51.687 --> 01:41:54.627]  Almost all your serial killers, it's sexual.
[01:41:54.847 --> 01:41:56.207]  It's sexual torture.
[01:41:57.028 --> 01:41:58.648]  This is the MO.
[01:41:58.748 --> 01:42:00.168]  This is the mindset.
[01:42:00.868 --> 01:42:04.849]  And so you look at the torture at Gitmo that we can't even mention here, folks.
[01:42:04.869 --> 01:42:07.870]  I mean, you can go read AP and Reuters reports about it.
[01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:10.390]  I'm not going to mention it here.
[01:42:10.450 --> 01:42:11.051]  It's so bad.
[01:42:11.731 --> 01:42:12.851]  It's so gross.
[01:42:15.606 --> 01:42:19.927]  And remember, Kay Bailey Hutchinson and Mitch and others, they went and watched the videos.
[01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:29.249]  There was over a thousand photos and over a hundred videos that the public wasn't allowed to see showing the rape of women and children.
[01:42:29.269 --> 01:42:34.310]  Can you imagine being a father or a mother and watching your child be tortured in front of you?
[01:42:34.650 --> 01:42:36.871]  Children as young as seven years of age.
[01:42:37.631 --> 01:42:41.272]  I mean, how do you people ever... But see, you did.
[01:42:41.292 --> 01:42:42.232]  You rationalized it.
[01:42:43.300 --> 01:42:46.901]  And again, at these camps, it's sexual.
[01:42:48.602 --> 01:42:50.623]  It's because the people doing it are sickos.
[01:42:54.184 --> 01:42:55.264]  And the Nazis did that too.
[01:42:56.485 --> 01:43:00.486]  They like to rape people and torture people and torture their children in front of them.
[01:43:01.346 --> 01:43:03.627]  But they're bad, but we're good.
[01:43:03.947 --> 01:43:04.888]  No, we're not good.
[01:43:04.928 --> 01:43:05.428]  We're sick.
[01:43:08.132 --> 01:43:11.235]  And I can't tell you how many editorials I've seen where they promote all this.
[01:43:11.815 --> 01:43:14.137]  And so I think you might have punched a cop.
[01:43:14.197 --> 01:43:28.269]  So we're going to take you downtown and in front of about 20 police, we're going to take a broomstick until blood pours out of your body for two hours.
[01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:34.615]  How do you even begin to imagine the pain involved in that?
[01:43:35.367 --> 01:43:42.569]  And by the way, it went public because a good cop, a senior officer, went and reported it, and the senior officers over him didn't do anything because he went to the media.
[01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:48.050]  But see, next time they'll think, well, maybe this was moral.
[01:43:49.050 --> 01:43:50.710]  Maybe the world's against me.
[01:43:50.730 --> 01:43:51.671]  Maybe I shouldn't report it.
[01:43:52.731 --> 01:44:01.873]  And so when you do something wrong, and the roid-head sicko who beats his wife, who maybe was a prison guard in...
[01:44:04.421 --> 01:44:08.764]  Iraq comes back home when Johnny comes marching home and it's your daughter, your son.
[01:44:11.726 --> 01:44:12.406]  Heaven help us.
[01:44:12.607 --> 01:44:13.387]  Just God help us.
[01:44:13.627 --> 01:44:16.729]  I don't... It's so sick.
[01:44:17.670 --> 01:44:22.193]  That TV show we aired earlier actually said the new American value, it's good.
[01:44:23.734 --> 01:44:24.294]  It's good.
[01:44:25.355 --> 01:44:26.095]  No, it's not good.
[01:44:26.135 --> 01:44:27.837]  It's straight out of the pit of hell.
[01:44:28.897 --> 01:44:30.798]  All of Christ's disciples were tortured.
[01:44:31.859 --> 01:44:33.020]  Christ was tortured.
[01:44:36.431 --> 01:44:38.312]  Well, the Romans didn't do anything sexual, though.
[01:44:38.352 --> 01:44:40.414]  They weren't as low as we are.
[01:44:43.916 --> 01:44:47.618]  Eleven of the twelve disciples were killed for what they stood for.
[01:44:48.739 --> 01:44:50.200]  Christ was brutally tortured.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:51.601]  You should go see The Passion of the Christ.
[01:44:52.582 --> 01:45:00.407]  Because that's a very historical rendition, reenactment, of that particular scene of the torture.
[01:45:00.907 --> 01:45:02.008]  He was unrecognizable.
[01:45:03.269 --> 01:45:05.250]  And the Bible is firmly against torture.
[01:45:07.952 --> 01:45:08.693]  Firmly against it.
[01:45:09.053 --> 01:45:10.334]  The founding fathers were.
[01:45:12.235 --> 01:45:27.006]  So, we see at Abu Ghraib the same things we see in the New York Police Department, the same thing we see this mother and father, allegedly, and if it's true, they need to be executed, doing to their baby.
[01:45:28.226 --> 01:45:33.230]  You see, it's the same demonic vomit.
[01:45:35.712 --> 01:45:35.912]  So,
[01:45:36.693 --> 01:45:39.575]  You better stand up against this torture and this mind job they're doing on us.
[01:45:39.715 --> 01:45:41.917]  It's the same thing with the microchips, all these TV shows.
[01:45:42.217 --> 01:45:43.038]  Oh, chips are good.
[01:45:43.078 --> 01:45:44.619]  Everybody needs a microchip under their skin.
[01:45:44.919 --> 01:45:49.262]  Andy Rooney, everybody needs a chip so we know who the good people are and know who the terrorists are.
[01:45:49.722 --> 01:45:51.504]  Are you saying what they're trying to sell us?
[01:45:51.584 --> 01:46:00.090]  And by the way, with the new electronic voting machines, they'll tell us we're for something even when we aren't and then pass it and then not care if we try to recall them because we can't.
[01:46:01.152 --> 01:46:06.514]  It's like 98% of people in Houston, 93% in Texas, in Austin, are against these toll roads.
[01:46:06.574 --> 01:46:07.575]  They just say, we don't care.
[01:46:08.355 --> 01:46:09.916]  Or they don't have electronic voting machines.
[01:46:09.956 --> 01:46:11.137]  They vote it down in England, 2 to 1.
[01:46:11.397 --> 01:46:14.358]  3 to 1, excuse me.
[01:46:16.319 --> 01:46:20.981]  Let's go ahead and see so they know they can do all this now with impunity.
[01:46:22.597 --> 01:46:23.437]  They're running wild.
[01:46:23.877 --> 01:46:32.680]  And as more and more criminals get in positions of power, as more and more sickos and psychopaths and sociopaths and sadists get into control, they put people like them under them.
[01:46:32.900 --> 01:46:38.941]  And they're going to feed and feed and feed a bloody feast on you and me.
[01:46:40.482 --> 01:46:46.683]  You want open culture possessed by the spirit of Satan?
[01:46:46.703 --> 01:46:48.964]  You're going to see it unless you stand up in a herd.
[01:46:50.756 --> 01:46:52.618]  Let's talk to Bart in Texas.
[01:46:52.638 --> 01:46:53.238]  Thanks for holding.
[01:46:53.278 --> 01:46:53.658]  Go ahead.
[01:46:54.299 --> 01:46:54.599]  All right.
[01:46:54.659 --> 01:46:57.581]  Well, Alex, you know, real quick on what you were talking about.
[01:46:57.701 --> 01:47:03.785]  Anybody that condones torture or doesn't condemn torture are not Christian.
[01:47:04.285 --> 01:47:07.587]  And if they try and make any claim to be, they're totally deluded.
[01:47:08.968 --> 01:47:10.850]  Well, America never had to torture before.
[01:47:10.870 --> 01:47:13.551]  You know, they sell it like it's some good, wonderful thing we've got now.
[01:47:13.872 --> 01:47:14.152]  No.
[01:47:15.413 --> 01:47:18.975]  Well, I mean, the other thing, too, is that whole argument about if it was your kid...
[01:47:19.602 --> 01:47:20.903]  You know, that have been kidnapped.
[01:47:20.943 --> 01:47:24.085]  What happens when it's your kid that's innocent and being tortured?
[01:47:25.006 --> 01:47:25.726]  Well, that's the point.
[01:47:25.746 --> 01:47:33.852]  The state is more apt to abuse us en masse, statistically, than the... because the smart psychopaths go become cops.
[01:47:34.472 --> 01:47:37.875]  Don't people understand that when this happens, that's what tyranny is?
[01:47:37.935 --> 01:47:39.256]  The criminals take over?
[01:47:39.276 --> 01:47:42.338]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[01:47:42.858 --> 01:47:45.360]  That's what the American people are being sold on, you know?
[01:47:46.058 --> 01:48:13.336]  But what I really wanted to talk about is, you know, I went to this indie media conference over the weekend at UT last weekend, and I have to say that I was really disappointed in the group of people that were there, and actually how frightened I am, because so many of them, I'd say probably my friend and I were the only people that weren't sucked into the left-right arguments,
[01:48:13.769 --> 01:48:14.289]  We're good to go.
[01:48:36.127 --> 01:48:39.388]  Well, what's frightening is indie media has a lot of potential.
[01:48:57.492 --> 01:49:00.955]  But its potential is totally being lost.
[01:49:00.995 --> 01:49:03.738]  Well, sir, just ignore it and set up your own independent media system.
[01:49:03.798 --> 01:49:05.560]  Oh, I mean, that's what I'm doing.
[01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:15.389]  And I mean, just not to harp on it too much, but to ask you a question, you know, you've talked in the past about how, you know, democracy now is funded by all of these corporations.
[01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:17.511]  I mean, listening to Ms.
[01:49:17.531 --> 01:49:21.395]  Goodman speak, I really have to almost wonder if she's agent provocateur.
[01:49:23.661 --> 01:49:27.482]  Well, I mean, look, they have the phony right-wing groups, they have the phony left-wing groups.
[01:49:27.622 --> 01:49:29.543]  I mean, Limbaugh and Danny Goodman are no different.
[01:49:30.123 --> 01:49:32.004]  They're there to give you false alternatives.
[01:49:32.604 --> 01:49:34.965]  And hey, are you not on 9 to Midnight anymore?
[01:49:34.985 --> 01:49:38.006]  Because I keep hearing Renz whenever I dial in on mine.
[01:49:40.066 --> 01:49:41.907]  I'm going to have to talk to you during the break.
[01:49:42.047 --> 01:49:42.967]  I'll try to answer that question.
[01:49:42.987 --> 01:49:47.069]  I'm not quite sure exactly what your question is, so I'll try to be specific.
[01:49:47.909 --> 01:49:48.729]  Whether you get some details.
[01:49:49.169 --> 01:49:50.250]  More calls, more news.
[01:49:50.270 --> 01:49:50.890]  It's all coming up.
[01:49:50.910 --> 01:49:51.290]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.866 --> 01:49:58.216]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.377 --> 01:50:02.747]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:05.894 --> 01:50:14.716]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.776 --> 01:50:21.718]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.838 --> 01:50:23.839]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.099 --> 01:50:34.666]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.846 --> 01:50:40.230]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:53.218 --> 01:51:01.484]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.745 --> 01:51:06.108]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.388 --> 01:51:15.295]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:51:19.418 --> 01:51:24.460]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.740 --> 01:51:31.483]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[01:51:31.944 --> 01:51:32.504]  What about you?

[01:52:58.337 --> 01:53:00.257]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:00.738 --> 01:53:03.578]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:05.899 --> 01:53:19.241]  Look, folks, I'm on three different internet streams during the day, two different ones at night, and unless the schedule's wrong at GCNlive.com, you should be able to get me from 9 until 6 in the morning.
[01:53:20.062 --> 01:53:21.802]  The show is re-aired three times.
[01:53:23.742 --> 01:53:25.483]  9 to midnight, midnight to 3, 3 to 6.
[01:53:28.288 --> 01:53:30.149]  And I get emails all the time.
[01:53:30.169 --> 01:53:31.170]  People hearing other stuff.
[01:53:32.231 --> 01:53:34.472]  And, you know, just look around.
[01:53:36.153 --> 01:53:37.895]  And if you've got a problem, call the network.
[01:53:37.935 --> 01:53:38.595]  You know, they'll help you.
[01:53:38.615 --> 01:53:39.296]  They're great folks.
[01:53:39.316 --> 01:53:42.037]  You can always call them and ask them.
[01:53:42.057 --> 01:53:51.864]  I really can't answer all those questions on air because I don't... I'm so busy just trying to... I've got to go do Battle of Popular Mechanics on NPR tonight.
[01:53:52.925 --> 01:53:53.926]  Trying to make a film.
[01:53:54.226 --> 01:53:55.326]  And I'm not whining.
[01:53:55.346 --> 01:53:57.348]  I mean, I'm getting the fight I wanted.
[01:53:58.047 --> 01:53:59.608]  More of the fight than I ever wanted, though.
[01:54:02.049 --> 01:54:03.450]  We're going to continue with open phones.
[01:54:03.470 --> 01:54:15.036]  We're going to talk to Randall and Joe and Harvey and another Randall and many, many others that are patiently holding as we start.
[01:54:17.338 --> 01:54:18.138]  Start the third hour.
[01:54:18.158 --> 01:54:20.719]  And I've just got a bunch of news here in front of me.
[01:54:21.300 --> 01:54:24.221]  All these articles about citizen spies all over the news.
[01:54:24.601 --> 01:54:27.502]  How wonderful it is they're training all these people to be spies on their neighbors.
[01:54:27.582 --> 01:54:31.744]  And it says, well, we're not just training them to fight terror, but crime too, you know, since they're interested.
[01:54:32.384 --> 01:54:33.785]  You know, to spy on their neighbors.
[01:54:33.905 --> 01:54:35.746]  Do they smell anything?
[01:54:35.786 --> 01:54:36.966]  Are they using drugs?
[01:54:37.026 --> 01:54:38.447]  Are they spanking their children?
[01:54:39.627 --> 01:54:42.448]  Which isn't even illegal, but they tell you it is.
[01:54:42.488 --> 01:54:43.869]  Go ahead and call on them.
[01:54:43.889 --> 01:54:44.909]  That's what they do with these things.
[01:54:44.949 --> 01:54:46.290]  I've even gone to some of these events.
[01:54:48.194 --> 01:54:59.923]  And I got... There's a new thing where they're going to make anybody who has a restraining order on them, which women usually get when they divorce their husbands, even if there's no violence, help to wear a dog collar around your neck.
[01:55:00.443 --> 01:55:02.565]  I'm not kidding, folks.
[01:55:03.385 --> 01:55:04.766]  This is mainstream news.
[01:55:06.528 --> 01:55:08.489]  And I've got the police raiding funerals.
[01:55:08.569 --> 01:55:13.012]  It just gets crazier and crazier and crazier by the minute.
[01:55:13.193 --> 01:55:14.654]  I got this USA Today article.
[01:55:15.174 --> 01:55:17.516]  I never got to yesterday, but I'm going to try to get to it in the next hour.
[01:55:19.111 --> 01:55:23.837]  About where the government now says it's not even that your house is condemned for problems.
[01:55:23.877 --> 01:55:30.324]  We just want your whole neighborhood for a new housing development because the developers want it.
[01:55:30.344 --> 01:55:31.606]  We're not even going to pay you fair value.
[01:55:32.687 --> 01:55:36.912]  It's just the wildest, most corrupt looting.
[01:55:36.952 --> 01:55:37.673]  I call it looting.
[01:55:39.182 --> 01:55:40.283]  And it's going to get worse and worse.
[01:55:40.423 --> 01:55:41.904]  That's what tyranny is, folks.
[01:55:42.284 --> 01:55:46.046]  In most cases in history, this is the norm.
[01:55:46.606 --> 01:55:55.371]  Criminals, ruthless, strong men and their supporters get control of societies, and they do whatever they want, and they tell you it's for your own good.
[01:55:55.391 --> 01:56:01.654]  And they call themselves the authorities, they call themselves the officials, no longer the servants.
[01:56:01.834 --> 01:56:05.076]  You are now the civilians in the military dictatorship.
[01:56:06.545 --> 01:56:18.075]  And to understand this, you need to get Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, and Police State 3, Total Enslavement, the premier Police State films out there, bar none.
[01:56:18.115 --> 01:56:19.657]  They're incredible documentaries.
[01:56:20.057 --> 01:56:25.642]  The concentration camps, the foreign troops, the black helicopters attacking, the torture, just all of it.
[01:56:26.143 --> 01:56:27.424]  You've got to get these videos.
[01:56:27.864 --> 01:56:29.626]  The government hiring provocateurs.
[01:56:31.169 --> 01:56:32.670]  You need these videos.
[01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:34.432]  You need to get them now.
[01:56:34.712 --> 01:56:36.874]  You need to get Road to Tyranny about 9-11.
[01:56:36.914 --> 01:56:40.797]  You need to carry a bunch of other films and books by other wonderful researchers.
[01:56:41.838 --> 01:56:46.802]  Infowars.com to peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[01:56:47.542 --> 01:56:48.463]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:56:48.483 --> 01:56:48.523]  888-253-3139.
[01:56:58.971 --> 01:57:07.335]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:57:08.315 --> 01:57:26.144]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv, all my films, dozens of other films, probably like a hundred of my weekly TV reports now that I've done, that have been up there on the site, hundreds of audio interviews, it's just PrisonPlanet.tv, monthly and yearly subscriptions available, 15 cents a day.
[01:57:27.367 --> 01:57:28.828]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:57:29.268 --> 01:57:29.668]  All right.
[01:57:30.288 --> 01:57:30.888]  Third hour.
[01:57:30.908 --> 01:57:32.449]  A bunch of news.
[01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.990]  Your calls.
[01:57:34.810 --> 01:57:35.650]  Straight ahead.
[01:57:36.891 --> 01:57:41.472]  So stay with us.
[01:57:43.753 --> 01:57:44.454]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:50.136 --> 01:57:50.796]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.436 --> 01:57:52.537]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.217 --> 01:57:54.397]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.417 --> 01:57:55.758]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.534 --> 01:57:57.395]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.415 --> 01:58:02.039]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.279 --> 01:58:06.423]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.864 --> 01:58:13.969]  Wow, those first two hours blasted past us.
[01:58:13.989 --> 01:58:17.392]  It is Thursday, the 24th day of good old February 2005.
[01:58:23.863 --> 01:58:25.264]  And I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:25.344 --> 01:58:28.627]  There is just a ton of news I want to get into in this hour.
[01:58:30.409 --> 01:58:34.252]  We need to focus more on these citizen spies, a global epidemic.
[01:58:34.733 --> 01:58:40.398]  Just yesterday we posted the story, hey, citizen spies, the latest, hottest class, is public, free, and big.
[01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:42.691]  Brother expects your participation.
[01:58:43.311 --> 01:58:52.114]  Now we read the BBC story about the citizens in Sussex, in England, armed with police-issued radar guns, patrolling their neighborhoods in shifts and documenting speeding motorists.
[01:58:52.494 --> 01:59:01.618]  Like all propaganda, the article gently demonstrates how necessary it is for the civilian spies to be on patrol, and look how cute the little old ladies are in their yellow vests.
[01:59:02.566 --> 01:59:07.249]  Good thing these volunteer spies took their anger management courses from the loving police state they worship.
[01:59:07.609 --> 01:59:11.371]  Otherwise, those bad lawbreakers might really have them down.
[01:59:12.032 --> 01:59:13.612]  And this is deadly serious.
[01:59:14.033 --> 01:59:19.856]  All around the world, Stasi-style civilian spy corps are popping up to help Big Brother keep watch.
[01:59:21.057 --> 01:59:23.098]  And from England to the U.S., I have these articles.
[01:59:23.898 --> 01:59:25.219]  Here's one out of the Wichita Eagle.
[01:59:25.359 --> 01:59:27.881]  Public offering class on terror spotting.
[01:59:27.941 --> 01:59:31.583]  I want to talk about this, but let's go back to your calls right now.
[01:59:32.409 --> 01:59:38.935]  Let's go ahead and speak with Joe in Florida.
[01:59:38.955 --> 01:59:39.835]  Joe, you're on the air.
[01:59:39.895 --> 01:59:40.356]  Go ahead.
[01:59:40.376 --> 01:59:41.397]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:41.437 --> 01:59:42.338]  Can you hear me all right?
[01:59:42.698 --> 01:59:43.318]  Pretty good, yeah.
[01:59:43.879 --> 01:59:44.199]  Okay.
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:54.108]  Well, I was in North Fort Lauderdale, Florida yesterday, and I noticed in the skies they had the smoke coming out of the jets, those big, long streams.
[01:59:55.809 --> 01:59:57.811]  And what is that stuff?
[01:59:57.891 --> 01:59:58.972]  If it's not... I mean, it...
[01:59:59.488 --> 01:59:59.968]  What is it?
[02:00:00.088 --> 02:00:01.049]  It could be for craps.
[02:00:01.209 --> 02:00:02.449]  It could be for something else.
[02:00:02.489 --> 02:00:03.670]  What's good with that stuff?
[02:00:03.930 --> 02:00:06.051]  Well, number one, what type of phone are you on?
[02:00:06.071 --> 02:00:09.932]  Here, let me take you off speakerphone.
[02:00:10.253 --> 02:00:12.253]  Yeah, that's kind of a rule on talk radio.
[02:00:12.353 --> 02:00:13.314]  Cordless is bad.
[02:00:13.374 --> 02:00:14.214]  Speaker's worse.
[02:00:15.295 --> 02:00:15.695]  Oh, okay.
[02:00:16.515 --> 02:00:17.536]  Can you hear me okay now?
[02:00:17.736 --> 02:00:18.056]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:18.836 --> 02:00:19.837]  All right.
[02:00:19.957 --> 02:00:20.837]  No, I heard what you said.
[02:00:21.077 --> 02:00:21.717]  Chemtrails.
[02:00:22.438 --> 02:00:22.718]  Yeah.
[02:00:23.218 --> 02:00:27.900]  Well, I mean, most people point up at jets with real condensation trails, ice crystals forming.
[02:00:28.729 --> 02:00:37.435]  Because the plane goes through the water vapor and causes it to condense and form larger conglomerates of the molecules then forming into ice crystals.
[02:00:38.656 --> 02:00:46.981]  But we'll see planes 4,000 feet on a hot day and it sits there for 3, 4, 5 hours.
[02:00:47.401 --> 02:00:48.442]  That's not normal.
[02:00:48.482 --> 02:00:49.763]  That's not scientific.
[02:00:50.223 --> 02:00:51.364]  Something's going on.
[02:00:52.250 --> 02:01:01.957]  And there's a whole area of study and debate about it, but I know this, until five, six years ago, I never saw this phenomenon, and now I see it with my own two little beady eyes.
[02:01:02.598 --> 02:01:16.388]  Yeah, and the reason why I'm calling and bringing it up is because not only did I see it in Fort Lauderdale, I mean, I must have counted 20 trails, and they were right over my head, and there was some farmland, but it was out further away from me.
[02:01:16.448 --> 02:01:19.630]  This was, like, actually right over my head and into the city a little more.
[02:01:20.262 --> 02:01:20.482]  All right.
[02:01:20.802 --> 02:01:22.224]  It was from Fort Lauderdale.
[02:01:22.304 --> 02:01:27.607]  It expanded all the way to West Palm Beach, which is about 60 miles away where I live.
[02:01:28.208 --> 02:01:31.490]  And I noticed it at the job.
[02:01:31.911 --> 02:01:34.773]  I noticed it on my way home to go to West Palm Beach.
[02:01:34.833 --> 02:01:36.434]  It was in West Palm Beach they were doing it.
[02:01:36.514 --> 02:01:37.455]  It was more than one plane.
[02:01:37.515 --> 02:01:40.137]  It was like three or four planes in each city doing it.
[02:01:40.517 --> 02:01:43.619]  And then I went to cut across over back to St.
[02:01:43.659 --> 02:01:45.461]  Petersburg, where I'm originally from.
[02:01:46.141 --> 02:01:48.683]  All this in one day, within a matter of two hours.
[02:01:49.221 --> 02:01:51.683]  Well, did they... Did each trail stay there for hours?
[02:01:51.783 --> 02:01:55.525]  They were staying there for a while, and they were actually expanding, too.
[02:01:55.665 --> 02:01:56.105]  Instead of just...
[02:02:19.491 --> 02:02:22.353]  No, I know.
[02:02:22.433 --> 02:02:23.734]  And that never happened before.
[02:02:23.814 --> 02:02:28.678]  I mean, as a child, we watched them fly over and the trail would disappear in maybe five seconds to a minute.
[02:02:29.298 --> 02:02:29.478]  Right.
[02:02:29.538 --> 02:02:30.759]  And now they just stay there.
[02:02:30.799 --> 02:02:32.701]  I mean, I've been in my backyard before for hours.
[02:02:32.741 --> 02:02:33.602]  It just doesn't go away.
[02:02:33.622 --> 02:02:36.424]  It just gets bigger and bigger and drops towards the ground.
[02:02:36.464 --> 02:02:37.204]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:37.224 --> 02:02:39.126]  We're talking about chemtrails.
[02:02:39.146 --> 02:02:40.587]  We need to have some more guests on about that.
[02:02:40.987 --> 02:02:41.468]  We'll be back.
[02:02:41.488 --> 02:02:41.788]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.538 --> 02:02:52.421]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.701 --> 02:02:54.081]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.261 --> 02:02:56.482]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.622 --> 02:02:58.723]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.983 --> 02:03:03.925]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.265 --> 02:03:08.287]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.547 --> 02:03:08.948]  We're good to go.
[02:03:23.404 --> 02:03:27.126]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.
[02:03:27.246 --> 02:03:28.807]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[02:03:28.827 --> 02:03:29.208]  That's 888-2533-139.

[02:03:31.669 --> 02:03:32.710]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[02:03:44.972 --> 02:03:46.593]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:46.713 --> 02:03:50.774]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:50.954 --> 02:03:53.835]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:53.915 --> 02:04:00.637]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:00.817 --> 02:04:03.818]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:04.038 --> 02:04:06.419]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:06.539 --> 02:04:14.441]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[02:04:14.781 --> 02:04:16.702]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:04:44.355 --> 02:04:46.036]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:04:46.236 --> 02:04:48.237]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:04:48.437 --> 02:04:49.117]  Prepare yourself.
[02:04:49.297 --> 02:04:52.998]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[02:05:03.242 --> 02:05:04.823]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.

[02:05:16.013 --> 02:05:16.313]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:05:50.157 --> 02:05:50.798]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.479 --> 02:05:52.500]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.241 --> 02:05:54.342]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.983 --> 02:05:55.824]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.565 --> 02:05:57.487]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.147 --> 02:06:01.912]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.333 --> 02:06:06.418]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.986 --> 02:06:15.709]  Alright my friends, we're now 8 minutes and 27 seconds into this third and final hour on this Thursday edition.
[02:06:16.329 --> 02:06:17.249]  Your calls are coming up.
[02:06:17.269 --> 02:06:23.412]  It's going to take a lot of them in this third hour at 800-259-9231.
[02:06:23.432 --> 02:06:36.617]  Every couple days I see news articles around the country, always glowing reports of how good these little tattletale squad meetings are, these snitch meetings that you're encouraged to go to.
[02:06:38.866 --> 02:06:46.590]  And I've gone to one or two of these, and they've sit up there in front of the crowd of do-gooders, and they talk about what to look for with terrorists.
[02:06:46.650 --> 02:06:51.893]  And then they go, now you may not think that normal crime is terrorism, but actually it is.
[02:06:52.033 --> 02:07:01.479]  It terrorizes your community and makes the police have to work hard fighting that, so then the real terrorists, the classical terrorists, can get you.
[02:07:02.439 --> 02:07:05.801]  And so they spend about 10% of their time showing you a picture of bin Laden and
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:10.842]  And then they teach you, look for people that look normal.
[02:07:11.242 --> 02:07:12.842]  A woman that looks like she's pregnant.
[02:07:13.462 --> 02:07:14.863]  Or a woman with a baby carriage.
[02:07:14.903 --> 02:07:15.763]  Or a priest.
[02:07:16.804 --> 02:07:18.704]  Do you smell marijuana?
[02:07:18.744 --> 02:07:20.325]  Do you hear people yelling at each other?
[02:07:20.825 --> 02:07:23.086]  Do you see people arguing on the side of the road?
[02:07:23.126 --> 02:07:23.786]  A man and woman.
[02:07:24.146 --> 02:07:26.607]  Is somebody walking down the road with a backpack?
[02:07:27.707 --> 02:07:30.048]  Do you see someone spanking their child?
[02:07:30.948 --> 02:07:32.329]  And so the people come to, quote,
[02:07:33.559 --> 02:07:38.400]  Fight terrorism, and they learn, oh, it's everything.
[02:07:39.680 --> 02:07:47.961]  Because, again, Homeland Security has said pot-dealing, topless Mars, county... Do we have a caller on the line with us?
[02:07:49.922 --> 02:07:51.242]  Oh, okay, that was unusual.
[02:07:52.242 --> 02:07:54.183]  We'll go back to your calls here in a little while.
[02:07:54.203 --> 02:07:57.623]  Folks never had that happen before, but we'll take your calls later here.
[02:07:58.443 --> 02:08:01.304]  But finishing up what I was saying...
[02:08:04.807 --> 02:08:10.550]  Going back to what I was saying, you go to these meetings and you learn.
[02:08:11.210 --> 02:08:13.631]  Is that person selling knock-off Rubik's Cubes?
[02:08:14.552 --> 02:08:23.236]  You learn that, oh, when somebody calls and complains too much, that's a form of harassment, a form of terrorism, so we need to come around.
[02:08:23.276 --> 02:08:24.837]  These are all real cases.
[02:08:25.678 --> 02:08:30.161]  I remember just weeks after 9-11, there was an AP article out of New Jersey where they were training them.
[02:08:30.201 --> 02:08:31.142]  Look for pregnant women.
[02:08:31.182 --> 02:08:31.962]  Look for priests.
[02:08:32.002 --> 02:08:33.664]  Look for people who look normal.
[02:08:33.844 --> 02:08:37.006]  All crime is really terrorism.
[02:08:39.427 --> 02:08:40.028]  It's amazing.
[02:08:40.108 --> 02:08:42.389]  So, here's an article.
[02:08:42.490 --> 02:08:46.172]  Now, understand, they don't have any real terrorists to fight.
[02:08:47.393 --> 02:08:47.773]  Okay?
[02:08:48.974 --> 02:08:51.676]  And so, what they then have to do...
[02:08:52.828 --> 02:08:56.130]  Is give the people something to tattle tell on like crime.
[02:08:56.470 --> 02:09:00.672]  But if they advertise, come be snitches for crime, most people won't show up.
[02:09:01.332 --> 02:09:03.593]  You know, if you see some crime going on, you'll call the police.
[02:09:03.693 --> 02:09:04.354]  I have before.
[02:09:04.774 --> 02:09:09.436]  But you don't need to go learn how to be a snitch and learn that, you know, was the neighbor spanking their child.
[02:09:10.417 --> 02:09:12.738]  The unlikely traffic cops...
[02:09:13.604 --> 02:09:16.528]  And this is one on the BBC where it shows they're doing it over there.
[02:09:16.968 --> 02:09:23.336]  Villagers in Sussex are so exasperated by speeding motorists, they are catching them themselves.
[02:09:23.397 --> 02:09:24.458]  And we have the same thing here now.
[02:09:24.478 --> 02:09:30.806]  69-year-old Pearl raises her shooting arm, takes aim, and pulls the trigger.
[02:09:30.826 --> 02:09:30.806]  41!
[02:09:30.986 --> 02:09:32.308]  Get him, Gene, she says.
[02:09:33.590 --> 02:09:39.572]  And the car is about 100 yards away and slows down until the pair's yellow jackets come into view.
[02:09:39.792 --> 02:09:47.934]  But it's too late for her and her colleague to scribble down the number plate as it passes unaware of the stony-faced stare from the driver.
[02:09:48.955 --> 02:09:57.217]  After speed, humps, cameras, and sleeping policemen, this is the latest initiative to try to curb fast drivers.
[02:09:57.297 --> 02:09:59.158]  It could soon be operating on a street near you.
[02:09:59.538 --> 02:10:01.279]  After all, it doesn't cost a penny.
[02:10:01.599 --> 02:10:02.599]  So they also sell it
[02:10:03.689 --> 02:10:11.373]  You know, for issues that sound kind of innocuous, like it's no big deal, that this is going to catch the terrorists for us.
[02:10:12.174 --> 02:10:16.676]  At first, it's little things, and then it expands out.
[02:10:17.817 --> 02:10:19.778]  But here's one out of the Wichita Eagle.
[02:10:20.979 --> 02:10:23.780]  Public offered class on terror spotting.
[02:10:24.521 --> 02:10:32.325]  It's going to take more than all the law enforcement officers in the country to keep America safe from terrorist attacks.
[02:10:33.695 --> 02:10:35.215]  We need our neighbors, too.
[02:10:35.435 --> 02:10:48.318]  Average folks will play a, quote, vital part in keeping the nation safe from terrorist acts, said Andrea Bannister, director of the Regional Community Policing Training Institute at Wichita State University.
[02:10:48.778 --> 02:10:54.399]  To help that along, the institute is hosting two free programs this week to train residents in counterterrorism.
[02:10:55.079 --> 02:10:56.459]  The first will be at 6 p.m.
[02:10:56.499 --> 02:11:01.680]  Wednesday at WSU, and the second will be the same time Thursday at Kansas State University University.
[02:11:03.138 --> 02:11:03.919]  In Manhattan.
[02:11:04.179 --> 02:11:04.880]  That's today.
[02:11:06.301 --> 02:11:13.226]  The Wichita class will be held in room 231 of Hubbard Hall in case you want to go.
[02:11:13.867 --> 02:11:16.789]  The K-State class will be in room 108 of the Edwards Hall.
[02:11:17.229 --> 02:11:18.790]  Registration of both sites will begin at 530.
[02:11:19.031 --> 02:11:22.954]  Participants will learn the basics of counterterrorism, she said.
[02:11:24.102 --> 02:11:28.725]  Who's going to notice these indicators out there is the community, she asked.
[02:11:29.265 --> 02:11:30.206]  Law enforcement?
[02:11:30.606 --> 02:11:32.487]  They can't be everywhere all the time.
[02:11:32.567 --> 02:11:33.908]  They can't be expected to be.
[02:11:34.388 --> 02:11:35.769]  That's just unrealistic.
[02:11:36.170 --> 02:11:41.593]  That's why classes are being created for the public to learn what to watch for, Bannister said.
[02:11:41.653 --> 02:11:47.737]  It's not unlike recognizing the signs of other threats, such as a meth house or a drug dealer.
[02:11:48.457 --> 02:11:51.239]  What you'll see with meth labs is a funny smell.
[02:11:52.151 --> 02:11:54.072]  Cellophane over the windows.
[02:11:54.592 --> 02:11:56.432]  Traffic going in and out, she said.
[02:11:56.912 --> 02:12:01.873]  Learning to recognize tip-offs of terrorism activity is the same idea as that.
[02:12:03.114 --> 02:12:04.954]  And it just goes on and on.
[02:12:05.014 --> 02:12:10.816]  Bannister recently returned from a two-week fellowship to Israel where she was taught how to resist.
[02:12:12.516 --> 02:12:13.496]  And it goes on and on.
[02:12:13.536 --> 02:12:16.737]  And how residents and law enforcement deal with suicide attacks.
[02:12:17.486 --> 02:12:18.729]  Such a big problem here.
[02:12:19.290 --> 02:12:23.419]  In Israel, for instance, authorities aren't the only ones who are well-educated on terrorist tactics.
[02:12:23.519 --> 02:12:26.546]  Bannister said, the bus drivers are very aware of what to look for.
[02:12:28.741 --> 02:12:30.421]  And she goes on and on.
[02:12:30.481 --> 02:12:34.182]  The program will show residents what to watch for and how to report to police.
[02:12:34.482 --> 02:12:41.604]  Participants will also learn more about the Patriot Act, the motivations and tools of terrorists, and what Homeland Security involves.
[02:12:41.664 --> 02:12:44.245]  So it'll be a propaganda piece for the Patriot Act, too.
[02:12:44.785 --> 02:12:50.366]  American law enforcement officers have been getting this kind of training for a while now, Bannister said.
[02:12:52.086 --> 02:12:54.247]  Well, I would encourage...
[02:12:55.794 --> 02:13:16.483]  People who live in that area to go to this, and I guarantee you, if you go and it's like the other training seminars we've seen, they'll spend about 10% of the time on terrorism and then move in to drugs and guns and, well, the 400 and something thousand truck drivers that are being trained for these new programs.
[02:13:18.064 --> 02:13:19.164]  We're going to fight terror.
[02:13:19.504 --> 02:13:23.066]  And then the truck driving company gets credits for
[02:13:24.230 --> 02:13:27.691]  On their insurance if they send their people to this and they get encouraged to do it.
[02:13:27.711 --> 02:13:29.772]  They can get cash payments if they do it.
[02:13:30.332 --> 02:13:32.873]  And we've read the manuals and I've covered it here on air.
[02:13:33.293 --> 02:13:35.613]  It says look for people wearing a backpack.
[02:13:36.414 --> 02:13:39.894]  Look for individuals who are arguing on the street.
[02:13:40.435 --> 02:13:42.075]  Do you see someone in their car?
[02:13:42.435 --> 02:13:45.156]  Does it not look like a normal cigarette?
[02:13:45.756 --> 02:13:47.236]  Does it look like marijuana?
[02:13:47.336 --> 02:13:48.737]  Are they holding it in?
[02:13:49.497 --> 02:13:50.737]  Call the police.
[02:13:52.218 --> 02:13:52.718]  It's sick.
[02:13:53.783 --> 02:13:54.904]  Totally un-American.
[02:13:55.024 --> 02:13:59.265]  And our government has hired former heads of the KGB to consult for Homeland Security.
[02:13:59.305 --> 02:14:00.126]  That is confirmed.
[02:14:00.586 --> 02:14:04.608]  They've hired Marcus Wolfe, the former head of the Stasi, as a consultant.
[02:14:05.608 --> 02:14:07.229]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:14:08.529 --> 02:14:09.190]  It's amazing.
[02:14:09.750 --> 02:14:14.092]  Let's go ahead now and take another call.
[02:14:15.552 --> 02:14:18.274]  Let's go ahead and talk to Harvey in Florida.
[02:14:18.314 --> 02:14:19.174]  Harvey, go ahead.
[02:14:19.615 --> 02:14:20.255]  Hello, Alex.
[02:14:20.275 --> 02:14:20.996]  How are you today?
[02:14:21.236 --> 02:14:21.596]  Good, sir.
[02:14:21.876 --> 02:14:25.438]  You're talking about so many important topics.
[02:14:25.478 --> 02:14:30.021]  When you were talking about torture chambers, I was really in tears.
[02:14:30.041 --> 02:14:33.864]  You know, today it's them, tomorrow it's you.
[02:14:35.325 --> 02:14:38.047]  Well, we were talking about the TV shows all promoting torture.
[02:14:38.707 --> 02:14:40.048]  And we were playing some clips, yeah.
[02:14:40.488 --> 02:14:44.651]  Yeah, well, you know, the caller that you had before who was...
[02:14:45.546 --> 02:14:47.947]  Well, I mean, certainly politicians grandstand.
[02:14:47.967 --> 02:14:52.127]  But, you know, even if a politician's bad, when they do the right thing, then we have to at least say it's good.
[02:15:14.073 --> 02:15:18.074]  Right, this may be one thing that he's doing good, but he's doing so many horrible things in Florida.
[02:15:18.114 --> 02:15:19.414]  Oh yeah, it's like rat poison.
[02:15:19.634 --> 02:15:21.714]  Rat poison is 98% good food.
[02:15:22.214 --> 02:15:24.895]  This is a publicity stunt for Jeb Bush.
[02:15:24.975 --> 02:15:26.055]  Don't be fooled by it.
[02:15:26.215 --> 02:15:34.317]  You still have to commend the legislature for passing that law to try to save this woman's life.
[02:15:34.737 --> 02:15:36.237]  That's absolutely correct.
[02:15:36.637 --> 02:15:41.458]  You know, for the last few days you were talking about the 9-11 bringing your evidence to the table.
[02:15:42.139 --> 02:15:47.801]  And I don't want to take too much of your time today, but if the people would just look at it, who really profited from it?
[02:15:47.841 --> 02:15:53.743]  It's not just the people that were short the stock exchange and the stocks on 9-11.
[02:15:54.363 --> 02:16:04.407]  The people that profited ever since were like the Grumman Corporation, the Lockheed Corporation, Martin Marietta, the Carlyle Group, especially run by Secretary of Defense Carlucci.
[02:16:06.668 --> 02:16:09.549]  George Bush's uncle just made record profits.
[02:16:10.296 --> 02:16:12.657]  Yeah, they were making record profits on this.
[02:16:12.937 --> 02:16:20.518]  The Carlisle Group bought those military companies for about 10 cents on the dollar before any of this happened.
[02:16:20.758 --> 02:16:21.598]  Yeah, that's what they did.
[02:16:21.879 --> 02:16:28.720]  They automatically claimed that we were all shutting down and the military buildup was over, knowing that then the prices would plunge.
[02:16:29.220 --> 02:16:34.761]  Then they bought up the companies, put their people in government, and radically expanded the defense budget.
[02:16:35.241 --> 02:16:35.422]  Yes.
[02:16:35.822 --> 02:16:37.482]  I mean, this is trillions of dollars, Alex.
[02:16:38.399 --> 02:16:41.702]  There's trillions of dollars.
[02:16:41.902 --> 02:16:47.146]  There's $2.4 trillion, $2,400,000,000 missing from the Pentagon in the last 10 years.
[02:16:47.826 --> 02:16:54.411]  But that's just what's missing, but what's been fed to these monsters is the military-industrial complex.
[02:16:54.551 --> 02:16:58.214]  And Carlisle Group just announced record profits this week.
[02:16:58.434 --> 02:17:01.356]  Their profits doubled in 2004 what they were in 2003.
[02:17:01.657 --> 02:17:07.321]  Right, so these are the friends of Daddy Bush, Grumman, Martin Marietta, Bechtel, Carlisle Group, Halliburton,
[02:17:07.830 --> 02:17:08.630]  So on and so forth.
[02:17:08.650 --> 02:17:10.771]  So a handful of companies that profit from this.
[02:17:10.811 --> 02:17:13.411]  You don't think that's reason enough when you're talking trillions of dollars?
[02:17:13.972 --> 02:17:15.832]  These companies were all on the brink of bankruptcy.
[02:17:15.852 --> 02:17:27.775]  Well, yeah, the motive for 9-11 was $4 trillion in oil in Afghanistan, excuse me, $3 trillion in Afghanistan, $4 trillion in Iraq, hundreds of billions in weapons sales, and getting a new military launch base to invade other countries.
[02:17:28.921 --> 02:17:32.044]  If the people can't see it, they're absolutely blinded by the propaganda.
[02:17:32.064 --> 02:17:34.987]  I mean, this is so blatant, and that's the reason for 9-11.
[02:17:35.227 --> 02:17:36.548]  It is blatant.
[02:17:36.708 --> 02:17:37.229]  Nothing less.
[02:17:37.269 --> 02:17:38.009]  Thanks for the call.
[02:17:38.069 --> 02:17:38.710]  I appreciate it.
[02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:39.230]  Good points.
[02:17:40.311 --> 02:17:44.535]  We'll talk to Randy and David and Jeremy and others.
[02:17:46.169 --> 02:17:49.831]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:17:50.231 --> 02:17:55.673]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:17:56.134 --> 02:18:01.276]  It makes me wonder if a US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:18:01.936 --> 02:18:15.226]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:18:15.746 --> 02:18:21.050]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:18:21.351 --> 02:18:27.255]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:18:27.875 --> 02:18:27.935]  1-800-686-2237
[02:18:45.946 --> 02:18:48.448]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:49.149 --> 02:18:58.797]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[02:18:59.797 --> 02:19:09.325]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[02:19:10.342 --> 02:19:15.846]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[02:19:56.384 --> 02:20:03.969]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:20:04.210 --> 02:20:07.372]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:20:07.492 --> 02:20:07.952]  We're good to go.
[02:20:26.181 --> 02:20:32.126]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.

[02:20:45.297 --> 02:20:53.261]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes, actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[02:20:53.661 --> 02:20:54.882]  It suppresses your immune system.
[02:20:55.122 --> 02:20:55.803]  Now check this out.
[02:20:56.163 --> 02:20:59.585]  The average American consumes two to three pounds of sugar on average each week.
[02:20:59.605 --> 02:21:02.026]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[02:21:02.566 --> 02:21:05.229]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[02:21:05.470 --> 02:21:06.270]  Your health suffers.
[02:21:06.511 --> 02:21:07.151]  It's that simple.
[02:21:07.472 --> 02:21:11.436]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[02:21:11.877 --> 02:21:19.806]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[02:21:20.246 --> 02:21:24.370]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.

[02:21:26.733 --> 02:21:28.114]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[02:21:28.134 --> 02:21:29.856]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[02:21:30.256 --> 02:21:31.017]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[02:22:02.233 --> 02:22:04.134]  Let's go straight back to your calls.
[02:22:06.455 --> 02:22:08.436]  Let's talk to Randy in Florida.
[02:22:08.496 --> 02:22:09.457]  Randy, you're on the air.
[02:22:09.477 --> 02:22:09.817]  Welcome.
[02:22:11.458 --> 02:22:13.399]  Go ahead, Randy.
[02:22:13.439 --> 02:22:20.903]  Yeah, well, you know, I mean, what you were talking about with the torture and all that just, you know, leads right into, you know, what's going on with Terry Shabo.
[02:22:20.943 --> 02:22:23.864]  I mean, if you could torture people, you certainly can starve them to death, too.
[02:22:23.884 --> 02:22:25.025]  That's the next step downward.
[02:22:26.983 --> 02:22:46.170]  Well, it certainly is, and again, torture can never be supported or advocated because the Founding Fathers, the Bible, it all tells us that we turn into what we're supposedly fighting, and now the media's promoting it wall-to-wall like it's a great thing, when they admit almost everybody at those camps in Iraq was totally innocent to begin with.
[02:22:46.831 --> 02:22:50.692]  And, you know, the torture's so good, why is it all perverted and sexual?
[02:22:52.032 --> 02:22:53.253]  Well, I just sent a letter...
[02:22:54.273 --> 02:22:59.054]  An email to the governor and a letter to the editor of our paper here.
[02:22:59.135 --> 02:22:59.915]  I'll run it by you.
[02:22:59.935 --> 02:23:11.898]  It says, Our state is once again on the verge of shamefully stuffing out the life of Terri Schiavo, an innocent woman in a despicable manner by starvation which can't even be done to an animal or a convict in Florida.
[02:23:12.778 --> 02:23:17.660]  Civil authority was established and ordained by God to defend and protect folks just like
[02:23:18.482 --> 02:23:19.502]  Well, that's a good point.
[02:23:19.522 --> 02:23:21.523]  If you starve a horse to death, you go to jail.
[02:23:21.543 --> 02:23:21.643]  Right.
[02:23:46.582 --> 02:23:50.984]  Or if you were to lock your dog up in a cage and starve it to death, you'd go to jail.
[02:23:51.024 --> 02:23:55.547]  But look, Terry, first they said she was vegetative, which she's not.
[02:23:55.567 --> 02:23:56.607]  She's fully conscious.
[02:23:56.627 --> 02:23:58.568]  I mean, that's admitted.
[02:23:59.889 --> 02:24:04.191]  But they kill people all the time who are verbally saying, may I please have food?
[02:24:04.812 --> 02:24:05.732]  Well, here's the rest of it.
[02:24:05.772 --> 02:24:14.417]  He or the local sheriff where Terry is should show some backbone or moral courage and defend their life by force if necessary, as I would in their position, despite what any court rules.
[02:24:14.864 --> 02:24:15.865]  All right, good to hear from you.
[02:24:15.885 --> 02:24:16.905]  I appreciate the call, Randy.
[02:24:16.945 --> 02:24:24.069]  He's right, and I hope we all get as upset about all the other cases of this that are happening as we've gotten over Terry.
[02:24:41.923 --> 02:24:45.405]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in Delaware.
[02:24:45.465 --> 02:24:46.125]  Go ahead, David.
[02:24:46.346 --> 02:24:47.126]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:24:47.166 --> 02:24:48.147]  How are you doing today?
[02:24:48.347 --> 02:24:48.587]  Good.
[02:24:49.247 --> 02:24:53.089]  I just got off the phone a little while ago talking to Michael McAvage.
[02:24:55.071 --> 02:24:55.891]  Repent America?
[02:24:56.131 --> 02:24:58.513]  Yes, they were found... All charges dropped.
[02:24:58.833 --> 02:24:59.073]  Yeah.
[02:24:59.973 --> 02:25:02.335]  Last week... Go ahead.
[02:25:02.615 --> 02:25:04.176]  You might tell folks what it has to do with.
[02:25:04.456 --> 02:25:05.877]  Okay, it was dealing with the...
[02:25:07.728 --> 02:25:16.387]  Sunday, October the 10th of 2004 in Philadelphia when they had a protest up there and there was also some homosexuals up there.
[02:25:18.248 --> 02:25:25.370]  I have the paperwork in front of me, but I have to look to see what... No, I mean, we talked about it last week, and we talked about it yesterday.
[02:25:25.410 --> 02:25:29.570]  For those who don't know, they were going to get 47 years in prison... 47 years in prison, yes, sir.
[02:25:29.671 --> 02:25:31.131]  ...for praying on the street corner.
[02:25:31.231 --> 02:25:31.411]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:31.451 --> 02:25:32.251]  They had videos.
[02:25:32.271 --> 02:25:37.592]  They touched no one, didn't raise their voices, but it was being called terrorism... Yes.
[02:25:38.192 --> 02:25:41.173]  ...because they were praying that might hurt someone's feelings.
[02:25:41.473 --> 02:25:41.633]  Yes.
[02:25:41.773 --> 02:25:45.474]  And the federal prosecutors advised the city, under Bush...
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:52.226]  Bush's prosecutors to try to put them in prison and thank God under public pressure the judge had to drop it.
[02:25:52.546 --> 02:25:55.789]  The point is, this shows what they're trying to do.
[02:25:56.910 --> 02:26:05.738]  He also mentioned that if you were getting in touch with him, if you wanted him to interview you or interview him, feel free to call him.
[02:26:06.119 --> 02:26:08.982]  Right now he's resting up, getting ready for the...
[02:26:09.884 --> 02:26:10.925]  Lawsuit, I guess it is.
[02:26:11.045 --> 02:26:17.688]  Yeah, we had them on about three times during the whole fight, and we're going to have them back on during their lawsuit.
[02:26:17.868 --> 02:26:18.088]  Right.
[02:26:18.688 --> 02:26:28.734]  Okay, so another thing is, about seven years ago, give or take, in reference to chemtrails, I only live about 20 miles from Dover Air Force Base.
[02:26:29.914 --> 02:26:33.756]  And the jets are messing up our sky daily.
[02:26:34.877 --> 02:26:39.479]  The sky, like I say, we've lost probably 20 or 30 percent of our daylight
[02:26:40.220 --> 02:26:46.745]  And our chemtrails... Sir, did you know that the Earth, according to the BBC and NASA, is measurably darker?
[02:26:47.325 --> 02:26:47.626]  Oh, yes.
[02:26:49.167 --> 02:26:58.514]  Also, about seven or eight years ago, or six, whatever it was, the hospitals were filled up with people with asthma, bronchitis, other different problems.
[02:26:58.674 --> 02:27:01.136]  And they mentioned, don't go outside unless you had to.
[02:27:01.616 --> 02:27:03.998]  And also, people were dying because of that.
[02:27:04.758 --> 02:27:06.078]  The gases and so forth.
[02:27:06.839 --> 02:27:08.219]  I have asthma myself.
[02:27:08.379 --> 02:27:11.080]  I know what effect it does to people with asthma.
[02:27:11.740 --> 02:27:14.561]  It makes you shortness of breath and so forth.
[02:27:14.761 --> 02:27:15.541]  Well, I know this.
[02:27:15.621 --> 02:27:19.442]  Until five, six years ago, trails didn't form at 2,000, 3,000 feet.
[02:27:19.462 --> 02:27:22.383]  They didn't stay there for five hours.
[02:27:22.843 --> 02:27:23.543]  Now they do.
[02:27:24.003 --> 02:27:25.524]  The earth is getting darker from it.
[02:27:25.644 --> 02:27:28.065]  Even mainstream news says that jet trails are doing it.
[02:27:28.425 --> 02:27:30.165]  What has changed in our atmosphere?
[02:27:30.185 --> 02:27:31.946]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:31.986 --> 02:27:32.906]  Thanks for the great points.
[02:27:36.195 --> 02:27:37.097]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.599 --> 02:27:39.202]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.124 --> 02:27:42.810]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.636 --> 02:27:47.096]  We're good to go.
[02:28:06.585 --> 02:28:10.486]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[02:28:10.686 --> 02:28:15.108]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:28:15.308 --> 02:28:19.149]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy-turn gear system.
[02:28:19.389 --> 02:28:25.571]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:28:25.771 --> 02:28:28.492]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:28:28.752 --> 02:28:32.076]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.
[02:28:32.176 --> 02:28:36.041]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on a compost twin.

[02:28:46.323 --> 02:28:49.347]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:49.687 --> 02:28:58.517]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:58.817 --> 02:29:03.503]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:03.963 --> 02:29:10.691]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:11.091 --> 02:29:22.824]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.344 --> 02:29:27.809]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:27.969 --> 02:29:30.432]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:47.620 --> 02:29:53.102]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:53.522 --> 02:29:57.763]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:57.983 --> 02:30:05.025]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:05.405 --> 02:30:11.507]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:11.647 --> 02:30:12.867]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:12.967 --> 02:30:13.528]  We're good to go.
[02:30:29.984 --> 02:30:36.646]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[02:30:43.668 --> 02:30:44.308]  Call today.
[02:30:46.649 --> 02:30:51.791]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.471 --> 02:30:54.772]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:10.994 --> 02:31:16.015]  Very interesting news report today on the Toronto Star.
[02:31:16.055 --> 02:31:17.256]  I wanted to mention this again.
[02:31:17.276 --> 02:31:20.356]  The top U.S.
[02:31:20.536 --> 02:31:27.738]  envoy to Canada over this situation trying to sell them on going under the U.S.
[02:31:27.818 --> 02:31:28.938]  Missile Defense Plan
[02:31:32.521 --> 02:31:46.426]  Said to them, hey, on 9-11 it was a Canadian general who gave the order to launch the F-16s to go and intercept and shoot down Flight 93 that was going towards D.C.
[02:31:48.046 --> 02:31:57.590]  But the official story is that wasn't shot down, and Rumsfeld twice has said on television that they shot it down, and then he turns red and then just moves on.
[02:31:57.630 --> 02:31:58.850]  No one ever calls him on it.
[02:32:00.350 --> 02:32:01.711]  And this envoy...
[02:32:03.365 --> 02:32:10.249]  Paul Salucci compared the situation to one that occurred during 9-11 terrorist attacks on the U.S.
[02:32:10.329 --> 02:32:16.553]  He noted that it was a Canadian general at NORAD who scrambled military jets under orders from U.S.
[02:32:16.593 --> 02:32:21.236]  President George W. Bush to shoot down a hijacked commercial airliner headed for Washington.
[02:32:23.477 --> 02:32:24.718]  Very, very interesting.
[02:32:26.219 --> 02:32:27.820]  And I didn't know it was a Canadian general.
[02:32:27.900 --> 02:32:33.183]  I thought it was the head of NORAD that was in control of that whole thing.
[02:32:33.778 --> 02:32:34.498]  Operation.
[02:32:34.898 --> 02:32:39.539]  That was General Myers at the time who got promoted.
[02:32:40.839 --> 02:32:44.480]  He got promoted after 9-11 to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[02:32:45.420 --> 02:32:47.320]  Let's now go back to the calls.
[02:32:48.281 --> 02:32:50.041]  Let's talk to Megan in Pennsylvania.
[02:32:50.101 --> 02:32:50.801]  Megan, go ahead.
[02:32:50.861 --> 02:32:51.161]  Welcome.
[02:32:51.461 --> 02:32:52.361]  Hi, thanks, Alex.
[02:32:52.461 --> 02:32:53.462]  It's good to talk to you again.
[02:32:53.982 --> 02:32:56.282]  You must be getting popular because it's hard to get through on the phone now.
[02:32:56.962 --> 02:33:01.083]  It's always been hard to get through if I'm taking calls.
[02:33:01.123 --> 02:33:01.663]  But that's good.
[02:33:02.319 --> 02:33:03.520]  I just had a couple things.
[02:33:03.560 --> 02:33:12.167]  The thing you were talking about with the citizen spies, I have an article that I should just mail you, because they're doing a similar thing in a county in Missouri.
[02:33:12.187 --> 02:33:14.468]  Every city I know of.
[02:33:14.528 --> 02:33:16.050]  I mean, I've seen hundreds of these articles.
[02:33:16.410 --> 02:33:17.431]  They've had it in Austin.
[02:33:17.471 --> 02:33:28.259]  You go to it, and they say, we've got video of it, they say, we're here to fight terrorism, but by ten minutes into it, it's about drugs and guns and... Right.
[02:33:29.647 --> 02:33:36.751]  And they're kind of couching this as, you know, this guy is an outside consultant who also happens to be in the Army Reserve at the fort there in Missouri.
[02:33:37.812 --> 02:33:47.078]  But, you know, he's saying things in the article about how we have homegrown terrorists who are willing to blow themselves up and whether they're Aryan Nation or environmentalists, you need to keep your eyes open.
[02:33:47.098 --> 02:33:47.918]  So...
[02:33:49.997 --> 02:33:50.678]  And what are there?
[02:33:50.718 --> 02:33:58.844]  A couple cases a year of some punk kid burning up some SUVs or burning up a house or something, which is bad, but you've always got nuts.
[02:33:59.424 --> 02:34:05.208]  Or, you know, the Aryan Nations might kill one black person or one Jew a year or something.
[02:34:05.969 --> 02:34:08.571]  It's not like it's some epidemic, but exactly.
[02:34:08.591 --> 02:34:11.473]  We've got homegrown terrorists, and this is how you spot them.
[02:34:11.693 --> 02:34:12.053]  Right.
[02:34:12.573 --> 02:34:14.115]  And, you know, with the torture thing...
[02:34:15.834 --> 02:34:18.735]  There was a terrible thing that happened here in Philadelphia about a month ago.
[02:34:18.755 --> 02:34:21.637]  They arrested that little 10-year-old girl for having scissors in her book bag, right?
[02:34:22.217 --> 02:34:30.801]  Well, last week they arrested three 9-year-old girls because one of them had brought a can from home that she thought was a can of perfume and it turned out it was mace.
[02:34:31.441 --> 02:34:45.107]  So they arrested these three little girls, handcuffed them to each other, took them to the police station and did not tell their parents anything until the parents came to pick the kids up from school and of course they were in tears and the police department says they're going to find out what went wrong.
[02:34:46.503 --> 02:34:52.005]  Well, I got a report here where they're trying to criminally charge a 13-year-old for shooting a rubber band in class.
[02:34:53.166 --> 02:34:56.147]  And that's the thing that's getting to me, is that they're really going after the kids.
[02:34:56.187 --> 02:35:08.312]  Look, look, look, they're threatening to kick New York children out of school because they told them, write letters to the troops, they wrote letters, no profanity, just we don't agree with the war, and they've made them apologize or they're expelled for what they wrote.
[02:35:09.492 --> 02:35:09.652]  Yeah.
[02:35:10.292 --> 02:35:11.573]  Well, I guess I would just
[02:35:11.909 --> 02:35:15.610]  I'm going to say a couple things about what, you know, people feel like they maybe can't do anything or whatever.
[02:35:15.670 --> 02:35:20.211]  But what my husband and I do is we keep a big file folder, kind of like you have when you're in your videos.
[02:35:20.711 --> 02:35:34.974]  And whatever thing seems to make sense to somebody as being a bad idea, like the New Freedom Initiative or too many vaccines for kids, that's the group of articles that we give somebody who might be moderately interested.
[02:35:35.014 --> 02:35:36.375]  And maybe you plant the seed.
[02:35:37.335 --> 02:35:41.336]  I gave the book True Lies to a school teacher that I know.
[02:35:41.721 --> 02:35:44.623]  Have you read that by the Guerrilla News Network?
[02:35:45.383 --> 02:35:46.344]  No, I haven't.
[02:35:46.364 --> 02:35:51.708]  They did excellent coverage on the DU, the anthrax vaccine, valerian being given to the troops.
[02:35:52.408 --> 02:36:03.916]  And so I may not be able to stop somebody that I know from signing up for the Army, but she's actually using this in her classes in a high school that I won't say where it is, that teach the kids about
[02:36:04.457 --> 02:36:06.761]  What's going on, so I hope that maybe... Well, we have to.
[02:36:06.841 --> 02:36:12.290]  Listen, they let all the recruiters in there have test scores, the names, they give them the military test.
[02:36:13.151 --> 02:36:14.874]  In there recruiting your children...
[02:36:15.823 --> 02:36:18.364]  And they admit that they lied to them on the contracts.
[02:36:18.384 --> 02:36:20.466]  They tell them, oh, you won't be in for more than two years.
[02:36:20.606 --> 02:36:23.507]  Now it will be unlimited, even if you sign up for the guard.
[02:36:24.288 --> 02:36:29.270]  They give them experimental vaccines that it's illegal to give them without their prior consent.
[02:36:29.310 --> 02:36:30.051]  They still do it.
[02:36:30.091 --> 02:36:31.832]  They make them breathe the depleted uranium.
[02:36:32.552 --> 02:36:35.454]  And the young people need to be told about this.
[02:36:35.474 --> 02:36:36.434]  Yes, I'm glad you're doing that.
[02:36:36.454 --> 02:36:45.219]  And one other thing that you might want to look into, they're talking about within the next 18 to 24 months, there was just an article that came out last week, if you Google nuclear tests,
[02:36:46.537 --> 02:36:51.081]  2005.
[02:36:46.917 --> 02:36:51.081]  They want to start reusing the Nevada test site for underground testing.
[02:36:51.101 --> 02:36:55.566]  Well, at least they're not doing above ground like they used to.
[02:36:55.586 --> 02:37:04.075]  Not yet, but it would be very interesting if they do that when they have a bunch of uranium dumps there on Yucca Mountain and they start blowing it up underground too.
[02:37:04.135 --> 02:37:06.377]  It's a pretty scary situation.
[02:37:07.538 --> 02:37:08.119]  Who knows?
[02:37:09.096 --> 02:37:09.936]  Thanks for what you're doing.
[02:37:10.217 --> 02:37:11.337]  Hey, thank you for the call.
[02:37:12.198 --> 02:37:13.859]  Let's talk to H.W.
[02:37:13.939 --> 02:37:14.679]  in Colorado.
[02:37:14.799 --> 02:37:15.680]  H.W., welcome.
[02:37:16.180 --> 02:37:18.021]  H.W., Colorado here.
[02:37:18.181 --> 02:37:20.542]  Alex, I haven't talked to you for a while.
[02:37:21.823 --> 02:37:27.186]  I wonder if 1360 is synchronized with your telephone right now.
[02:37:27.866 --> 02:37:29.908]  I heard too many things on the radio.
[02:37:29.988 --> 02:37:31.528]  I'm a little thrown off, maybe.
[02:37:32.129 --> 02:37:34.250]  I totally don't understand anything you're saying.
[02:37:35.351 --> 02:37:36.871]  You do not understand?
[02:37:36.891 --> 02:37:37.772]  You mean here?
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:44.063]  I mean, sir, you're just, you talk... Please, I'm sorry, I just, I'm having trouble.
[02:37:45.263 --> 02:37:47.625]  It is an ordinary landline.
[02:37:47.645 --> 02:37:51.026]  I do not understand why you do not hear.
[02:37:51.046 --> 02:37:52.807]  Well, I do hear you.
[02:37:52.867 --> 02:37:54.768]  I don't understand what you're saying.
[02:37:54.808 --> 02:38:03.793]  Well, the radio I heard was 1360 AM, and it was not the same show that I got on the phone.
[02:38:05.593 --> 02:38:08.614]  No, that's because there's a delay.
[02:38:09.494 --> 02:38:11.115]  No, it was more than a delay.
[02:38:11.475 --> 02:38:12.575]  Maybe an hour or two.
[02:38:13.076 --> 02:38:26.541]  Anyway, when I got excited was when I heard you talk about trillions of dollars there being made disappear.
[02:38:27.542 --> 02:38:31.143]  And I just wanted to introduce Murphy's Law.
[02:38:31.703 --> 02:38:33.264]  Now, what if people...
[02:38:34.536 --> 02:38:36.156]  Would start printing money.
[02:38:36.276 --> 02:38:42.597]  Of course, by Murphy's Law, if something could go wrong, it would go wrong.
[02:38:42.697 --> 02:38:43.218]  You know it?
[02:38:44.378 --> 02:38:45.618]  Yes, I know Murphy's Law.
[02:38:45.878 --> 02:38:46.158]  Right.
[02:38:46.618 --> 02:38:48.699]  So, and the listeners do too.
[02:38:49.139 --> 02:38:49.719]  Most common.
[02:38:49.799 --> 02:38:56.560]  So if somebody was allowed to print money and con you into accepting it, then things would go all wrong.
[02:38:57.460 --> 02:38:57.680]  Right?
[02:38:59.380 --> 02:38:59.800]  All righty.
[02:39:00.401 --> 02:39:00.641]  Yeah.
[02:39:01.081 --> 02:39:02.781]  Now, that's where we are.
[02:39:04.094 --> 02:39:06.136]  There's two kinds of people in the world.
[02:39:06.196 --> 02:39:16.649]  The one kind that works and got to produce and even that is thinning and ripping up the earth like putting a nuclear bomb underground.
[02:39:16.729 --> 02:39:18.851]  That's probably worse than on top of it.
[02:39:18.992 --> 02:39:22.596]  What does that have to do with 2.4 trillion missing from the Pentagon?
[02:39:24.377 --> 02:39:25.438]  That's just what I say.
[02:39:25.458 --> 02:39:31.022]  Murphy's Law means that things go wrong whenever people do things.
[02:39:31.242 --> 02:39:33.664]  Well, the government is always going to do bad things.
[02:39:33.724 --> 02:39:34.605]  That's just history.
[02:39:35.165 --> 02:39:35.786]  Right.
[02:39:36.506 --> 02:39:39.028]  But we've been taught that that isn't the case, and that's pure idiocy.
[02:39:39.189 --> 02:39:40.470]  H.W., good hearing from you.
[02:39:41.210 --> 02:39:42.111]  Glad you're tuning in.
[02:39:42.151 --> 02:39:42.791]  God bless.
[02:39:42.932 --> 02:39:43.832]  Ron in New York.
[02:39:44.012 --> 02:39:44.913]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:39:44.933 --> 02:39:45.934]  Alex.
[02:39:46.374 --> 02:39:46.695]  Yes, sir.
[02:39:46.835 --> 02:39:47.135]  How you doing?
[02:39:47.668 --> 02:39:48.589]  I'm doing a radio show.
[02:39:48.609 --> 02:39:49.190]  I'm doing all right.
[02:39:49.210 --> 02:39:50.752]  How are you doing?
[02:39:50.772 --> 02:39:52.314]  Tell me what's right or wrong about this.
[02:39:52.354 --> 02:39:57.641]  Don't we need an organized network where we're all coordinated together?
[02:39:57.661 --> 02:40:02.647]  We know what each one of us is doing, that there's kind of an organized... No, there's a problem with that.
[02:40:03.320 --> 02:40:07.103]  Because then it's easier to infiltrate, easier to spread disinfo.
[02:40:07.544 --> 02:40:15.910]  It's good to have lots of individuals out there doing different things, being leaders themselves, setting up their own organizations, and training others how to be leaders.
[02:40:16.351 --> 02:40:22.976]  We actually need more leaders in this fight to go out and wake up other people and to pick a few issues they want to deal with.
[02:40:24.397 --> 02:40:31.383]  The second part of this is when these people decide to pull the plug and use their physical prowess against us...
[02:40:33.257 --> 02:40:40.140]  Don't we need to have key, influential, and powerful people in government, police, and military to counteract and countermand them?
[02:40:40.600 --> 02:40:41.201]  Well, we do.
[02:40:41.381 --> 02:40:47.083]  I mean, there's quite a few congressmen and people that go public on all this police state and say it's the end of America.
[02:40:47.763 --> 02:40:49.544]  And there's people who speak up and get involved.
[02:40:49.564 --> 02:40:51.085]  The media doesn't give them a lot of attention.
[02:40:51.847 --> 02:40:53.648]  And they've already pulled the plug.
[02:40:53.668 --> 02:40:55.249]  They're already using force on us.
[02:40:55.790 --> 02:40:57.311]  They're training us that torture's good.
[02:40:57.331 --> 02:40:59.132]  They're training us that we don't have any due process.
[02:40:59.172 --> 02:41:01.514]  They're training us that secret arrest is good.
[02:41:01.934 --> 02:41:04.436]  I mean, look, it's all slow-motion tyranny.
[02:41:05.736 --> 02:41:08.398]  You know, Pastor Butch mentioned a particular colonel.
[02:41:08.418 --> 02:41:17.244]  He doesn't have to be named here, but something was supposed to go down in January, he had said, and his comment was something huge in January.
[02:41:17.284 --> 02:41:18.525]  He wanted prayers for it.
[02:41:18.545 --> 02:41:19.906]  Of course, it didn't happen.
[02:41:20.492 --> 02:41:21.032]  That's a good question.
[02:41:21.052 --> 02:41:21.793]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:43.837 --> 02:42:00.461]  It was deliberate enough, if it was open enough, the tyranny, the corruption, the expansion of the despotism was big enough, and people weren't conditioned to a great extent, then you might see more organized resistance in high-level quarters of government.
[02:42:01.881 --> 02:42:03.961]  But it's so incremental, you really don't.
[02:42:04.041 --> 02:42:11.803]  I mean, we see people leaking documents, we see people going public, we see all sorts of things happening.
[02:42:11.823 --> 02:42:12.123]  We see...
[02:42:12.870 --> 02:42:15.652]  Prominent members of the government blowing the whistle on lies.
[02:42:17.372 --> 02:42:23.316]  On insider trading and scams and lies in 9-11 and just all of this.
[02:42:23.996 --> 02:42:29.799]  But still, because the courts are so controlled by the corrupt interest, no one is prosecuted.
[02:42:29.859 --> 02:42:30.860]  No one's brought to justice.
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:38.904]  A good thing to ask is, could we get a state or federal grand jury, which they have the power to do, to call for indictments?
[02:42:39.867 --> 02:42:43.328]  I mean, we had a grand jury in Arkansas.
[02:42:43.528 --> 02:42:53.191]  They picked a petty issue, lying to a court, you know, petty compared to some of the other stuff, to call Bill Clinton into court, into deposition.
[02:42:54.991 --> 02:42:59.192]  And we've had White House officials lie under oath about 9-11.
[02:42:59.532 --> 02:43:04.434]  Condoleezza Rice has said she never got a memo about plans to fly planes into buildings, and now that memo's public.
[02:43:05.654 --> 02:43:07.274]  And we know she lied about it from day one.
[02:43:07.294 --> 02:43:09.115]  Well, why not drag her up there and do that?
[02:43:10.660 --> 02:43:15.663]  Or Rumsfeld underwrote to Congress saying, they've got weapons of mass destruction, we know where they are.
[02:43:16.543 --> 02:43:18.684]  How about indicting him?
[02:43:19.645 --> 02:43:21.646]  And believe me, that'd bring this government down real quick.
[02:43:21.686 --> 02:43:23.887]  But look, you could bring this government down today.
[02:43:23.967 --> 02:43:24.988]  It's like shark teeth.
[02:43:26.008 --> 02:43:28.950]  There's a whole other row of these people to step into their place.
[02:43:29.310 --> 02:43:30.110]  Bush is a puppet.
[02:43:30.210 --> 02:43:30.971]  Rice is a puppet.
[02:43:31.011 --> 02:43:31.831]  Rumsfeld's a puppet.
[02:43:32.392 --> 02:43:33.092]  Earl's a puppet.
[02:43:34.133 --> 02:43:38.575]  It's these global interests, these global corporations that aren't free market...
[02:43:39.184 --> 02:43:44.565]  They're crime syndicates, and they own the politicians like so many pieces of eight in their pocket.
[02:43:45.585 --> 02:43:53.727]  Now, by punishing their puppets politically, then the next group of puppets may be a little bit more careful about it and may go a little bit slower.
[02:43:53.767 --> 02:43:56.808]  We've got to ask ourselves, why is government so arrogant?
[02:43:58.348 --> 02:44:02.089]  On every issue, oh, 87% of you want us to control the borders.
[02:44:02.109 --> 02:44:03.169]  Well, we're just getting rid of them.
[02:44:03.709 --> 02:44:06.050]  Oh, 65% don't want gun control.
[02:44:06.070 --> 02:44:06.950]  Well, we're still going to do it.
[02:44:08.334 --> 02:44:10.695]  You know, 60-something percent are against abortion.
[02:44:10.715 --> 02:44:13.577]  We're still going to do it.
[02:44:13.597 --> 02:44:15.138]  Oh, you're against toll roads.
[02:44:15.158 --> 02:44:16.598]  You know, 98% of you.
[02:44:16.618 --> 02:44:17.699]  Well, we're still going to do it.
[02:44:18.079 --> 02:44:19.100]  Try to vote us out.
[02:44:19.200 --> 02:44:20.060]  Ha, ha, ha!
[02:44:20.260 --> 02:44:22.802]  We got that new special voting machine, idiot!
[02:44:24.182 --> 02:44:25.143]  That's why, folks.
[02:44:25.203 --> 02:44:27.004]  That's why they're really arrogant.
[02:44:27.644 --> 02:44:29.405]  I've got USA Today here in front of me.
[02:44:30.506 --> 02:44:34.368]  We're all over the country in one particular case where they just told the whole neighborhood...
[02:44:34.923 --> 02:44:38.606]  100-year-old houses, beautiful homes worth about $200,000 apiece.
[02:44:39.206 --> 02:44:45.770]  Middle-class people, they just said, we're taking your whole neighborhood because developers gave us campaign contributions and they want that land for bigger houses.
[02:44:47.191 --> 02:44:50.494]  You know, it's not for a road or even a shopping mall now.
[02:44:50.534 --> 02:44:51.254]  We're just taking it.
[02:44:51.274 --> 02:44:54.336]  And by the way, we're not going to pay you just compensation for that.
[02:44:58.079 --> 02:44:59.720]  The Supreme Court's hearing the case right now.
[02:45:01.101 --> 02:45:04.484]  Supreme Court, two years ago, ruled they can take your land without just compensation.
[02:45:04.804 --> 02:45:06.205]  We'll see what they do in this particular case.
[02:45:06.705 --> 02:45:09.187]  I mean, that's why they're getting so arrogant.
[02:45:11.689 --> 02:45:12.770]  Rob in Wyoming.
[02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:13.651]  Rob, go ahead.
[02:45:14.091 --> 02:45:26.000]  Alex, about July, I sent three of your videos on a six-hour tape to the governor of Wyoming, Governor Friedenthal, because I'd heard him say that he didn't want to vote for Bush because he was concerned about the Patriot Act.
[02:45:27.575 --> 02:45:30.658]  His policy manager, can I give her name or not?
[02:45:31.018 --> 02:45:31.619]  Would you rather not?
[02:45:31.799 --> 02:45:33.241]  Well, these are public figures, sir.
[02:45:33.261 --> 02:45:33.921]  Yeah, I figured that out.
[02:45:33.941 --> 02:45:35.343]  But since you said it, just don't give it.
[02:45:35.383 --> 02:45:36.083]  I mean, I don't, you know.
[02:45:36.404 --> 02:45:39.727]  Well, that's the way I see it, but I wanted to check with you.
[02:45:39.747 --> 02:45:40.728]  We don't have a lot of time, though.
[02:45:40.748 --> 02:45:41.189]  What's going on?
[02:45:41.249 --> 02:45:50.238]  Okay, anyway, so now I read on the front page of the Casper Star Tribune, Friday 18th, I believe, of this month, the propaganda outlet.
[02:45:50.891 --> 02:45:54.012]  That they're building an urban warfare mock city.
[02:45:54.313 --> 02:46:01.896]  After the governor has admitted he's watched this video, he's allowing this mock city urban warfare camp in Guernsey, Platt County, Wyoming.
[02:46:02.136 --> 02:46:04.157]  Now, I've tried to get the policy manager.
[02:46:05.664 --> 02:46:11.906]  By the way, they're building these, Mark, and I've seen this story, they're building these camps all over the country.
[02:46:12.666 --> 02:46:14.326]  They're not just training centers.
[02:46:15.387 --> 02:46:17.147]  I want to commend you for giving the videos.
[02:46:17.207 --> 02:46:17.647]  Oh, yeah.
[02:46:17.787 --> 02:46:19.608]  I've handed out over a hundred of your videos.
[02:46:19.628 --> 02:46:20.968]  So you talked to their policy person.
[02:46:20.988 --> 02:46:21.488]  What did they say?
[02:46:22.028 --> 02:46:23.408]  Well, she didn't know about it.
[02:46:23.488 --> 02:46:25.329]  She says she doesn't know about it.
[02:46:25.469 --> 02:46:29.650]  She herself admits she's watched the video, too, and admits that it's very concerning.
[02:46:29.690 --> 02:46:32.411]  She keeps saying, what on earth can the governor do about it?
[02:46:32.811 --> 02:46:34.351]  And I'm like, you're joking, right?
[02:46:34.995 --> 02:46:39.398]  And now she refuses to call back to acknowledge that this camp is being built.
[02:46:39.418 --> 02:46:45.582]  Well, I think it's amazing that you got the governor's assistant to say she watched it and that she's concerned.
[02:46:45.602 --> 02:46:48.024]  I mean, that sounds like you're getting some real... I don't think so.
[02:46:48.084 --> 02:46:49.085]  Not when the camp's going in.
[02:46:49.105 --> 02:46:51.146]  This state only has half a million people.
[02:46:51.606 --> 02:46:53.047]  But you can't talk to the governor.
[02:46:53.568 --> 02:46:59.152]  So I want everybody to call Governor Friedenthal in Wyoming and demand that this terrorist training camp be removed.
[02:46:59.772 --> 02:47:01.793]  Knowing that the government is the terrorists.
[02:47:01.974 --> 02:47:02.414]  It's a joke.
[02:47:03.631 --> 02:47:07.793]  Well, we've got to build lots of these camps to train people to fight the terrorists.
[02:47:08.013 --> 02:47:09.673]  Yeah, I've got the number.
[02:47:10.473 --> 02:47:12.214]  But we can't spend that money on the border.
[02:47:12.454 --> 02:47:14.275]  Can I give out the number for people to call?
[02:47:14.455 --> 02:47:14.715]  Sure.
[02:47:14.995 --> 02:47:15.355]  Okay.
[02:47:15.875 --> 02:47:21.297]  This is her cell phone, 307... Wait a minute, I don't want to give out one of his staffers... Hold on a minute.
[02:47:21.437 --> 02:47:26.199]  If you want to give the governor's public number out, you can, but I don't want to give out some assistant's cell phone.
[02:47:26.239 --> 02:47:29.580]  That's fine, it's the number they gave me, but here's the regular number, 777-7434, area code 307.
[02:47:33.843 --> 02:47:36.144]  Tell them, get this training camp out of our state.
[02:47:36.944 --> 02:47:39.105]  Just so you know, you said that so fast, nobody got it.
[02:47:39.145 --> 02:47:44.247]  Okay, area code 307-777-7434.
[02:47:45.747 --> 02:47:48.468]  And she is a public figure, and there's no reason not to give her name.
[02:47:49.309 --> 02:47:50.009]  Yeah, that's fine.
[02:47:50.029 --> 02:47:53.050]  Whether I asked or not has nothing to do with whether it's okay to give her name.
[02:47:53.070 --> 02:47:54.871]  Well, you're the one that brought it up, brother.
[02:47:54.891 --> 02:47:57.652]  Well, if I gave her name ahead of time, you'd be mad at me for...
[02:47:58.730 --> 02:48:00.772]  No, I wouldn't.
[02:48:01.092 --> 02:48:02.133]  None of it's a public thing.
[02:48:02.634 --> 02:48:03.194]  I agree.
[02:48:03.334 --> 02:48:04.475]  Beth Worthen is her name.
[02:48:04.735 --> 02:48:06.277]  Yeah, but I mean, that's not even the issue.
[02:48:06.717 --> 02:48:07.157]  I agree.
[02:48:07.217 --> 02:48:08.378]  I'm not arguing with you.
[02:48:08.638 --> 02:48:11.461]  Sounds like she's talking to you.
[02:48:11.541 --> 02:48:13.262]  She's placating me is what she's doing.
[02:48:13.543 --> 02:48:14.383]  It's been over a week.
[02:48:14.443 --> 02:48:23.571]  She still can't get back to me to tell me, yes, the governor's aware that the government was behind 9-11, but he's still building an 11-building mock city to...
[02:48:24.051 --> 02:48:29.598]  And it says in the article, it's good for the economy of Guernsey, and it can be just as easily used against... Now, wait a minute.
[02:48:29.618 --> 02:48:33.543]  Did she say the government knows... She said she saw the video.
[02:48:33.663 --> 02:48:34.745]  She doesn't argue with it.
[02:48:34.805 --> 02:48:36.907]  She has nothing to dispute about the fact in it.
[02:48:37.488 --> 02:48:40.171]  And she says the government... Well, I would just say good job to you.
[02:48:40.492 --> 02:48:41.032]  We'll be back.
[02:48:41.052 --> 02:48:41.453]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.013 --> 02:48:50.362]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.542 --> 02:48:54.891]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:56.866 --> 02:48:59.489]  To use this disaster with a new world order.
[02:48:59.569 --> 02:49:02.412]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:49:02.672 --> 02:49:06.896]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.956 --> 02:49:13.904]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.004 --> 02:49:16.026]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.246 --> 02:49:26.829]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.009 --> 02:49:32.370]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:51:25.256 --> 02:51:25.496]  I think?
[02:51:53.938 --> 02:51:54.919]  Mark in Rhode Island.
[02:51:54.959 --> 02:51:55.619]  You're on the air.
[02:51:55.639 --> 02:51:56.300]  Welcome.
[02:51:56.340 --> 02:51:56.800]  Go ahead.
[02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:58.301]  Hi, Alex.
[02:51:58.341 --> 02:51:59.401]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:51:59.602 --> 02:51:59.962]  You bet.
[02:52:00.582 --> 02:52:10.548]  I know you were talking about the Canadian response to us about being part of the air defense, the NATO thing.
[02:52:10.588 --> 02:52:11.308]  Is that what that was?
[02:52:11.629 --> 02:52:12.409]  Not NATO.
[02:52:12.509 --> 02:52:15.751]  Not the North Atlantic Defense Organization.
[02:52:15.791 --> 02:52:18.273]  I'm talking about North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
[02:52:18.913 --> 02:52:20.654]  We're talking about NORAD.
[02:52:21.736 --> 02:52:22.176]  Okay.
[02:52:22.416 --> 02:52:22.817]  That's right.
[02:52:23.117 --> 02:52:25.478]  And in there, the U.S.
[02:52:25.578 --> 02:52:29.260]  envoy to Canada, I'm not going to just read his quote.
[02:52:30.420 --> 02:52:33.702]  He compared the situation to one that occurred during 9-1-1 terrorist attacks.
[02:52:34.142 --> 02:52:39.104]  On the U.S., he noted that it was Canadian General at NORAD who scrambled military jets under orders from U.S.
[02:52:39.144 --> 02:52:40.185]  President George Bush.
[02:52:41.145 --> 02:52:42.346]  Well, Bush says he never ordered it.
[02:52:42.746 --> 02:52:45.707]  To shoot down a hijacked commercial aircraft headed for Washington.
[02:52:46.187 --> 02:52:47.408]  Well, they didn't shoot it down.
[02:52:49.648 --> 02:52:49.868]  Right.
[02:52:50.529 --> 02:52:56.292]  Alex, did you know that that man, Paul Savucci, was a former governor of Massachusetts?
[02:52:57.672 --> 02:52:58.333]  I did, yes.
[02:52:58.713 --> 02:53:00.554]  Oh, okay, yeah.
[02:53:00.594 --> 02:53:08.558]  He was the former governor back in the late 90s, and he was very close with the Bush family, I believe, and the Republican Party.
[02:53:08.899 --> 02:53:09.199]  Yes.
[02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:11.800]  Hey, one other thing, Alex.
[02:53:11.840 --> 02:53:13.501]  I haven't heard Paul Watson on for a while.
[02:53:13.581 --> 02:53:14.922]  Is he still around, or...?
[02:53:16.113 --> 02:53:16.813]  Ask Paul.
[02:53:16.933 --> 02:53:18.394]  He's always busy doing stuff.
[02:53:18.454 --> 02:53:19.914]  I ask him to come on the show routinely.
[02:53:20.575 --> 02:53:20.715]  Okay.
[02:53:20.735 --> 02:53:24.036]  Alex, do you remember that show back in the 60s called The Prisoner?
[02:53:24.976 --> 02:53:25.496]  Yes, I do.
[02:53:25.516 --> 02:53:27.437]  I saw an episode.
[02:53:27.457 --> 02:53:29.178]  It's full of Illuminati symbols.
[02:53:29.198 --> 02:53:31.078]  They just throw it in your face there as well.
[02:53:31.518 --> 02:53:32.159]  Yeah.
[02:53:32.579 --> 02:53:36.720]  Patrick McGowan, who's the star of the show, was sitting down with number two.
[02:53:36.760 --> 02:53:37.480]  He's number six.
[02:53:38.161 --> 02:53:42.022]  And number two says to him, we'd like to create...
[02:53:42.677 --> 02:53:46.299]  This global village, but on a worldwide scale.
[02:53:46.339 --> 02:53:47.500]  He said, that's our dream.
[02:53:48.701 --> 02:53:51.403]  Yeah, and the village, it's funny you mention that.
[02:53:51.423 --> 02:53:52.864]  I actually bought it on DVD.
[02:53:52.904 --> 02:53:53.965]  It was very expensive.
[02:53:54.545 --> 02:53:57.647]  Just because it's such an amazing series.
[02:53:58.107 --> 02:54:05.072]  And yeah, it's a mind control village run by the New World Order where they test mass mind control to then expand it worldwide.
[02:54:05.552 --> 02:54:05.952]  Exactly.
[02:54:06.433 --> 02:54:07.514]  Alex, thank you very much.
[02:54:07.554 --> 02:54:08.074]  Keep up the fight.
[02:54:08.536 --> 02:54:10.739]  All right, I really do appreciate your call.
[02:54:11.139 --> 02:54:19.889]  Yeah, they do flaunt it in our faces via these different TV shows, and we need to be aware of this.
[02:54:20.570 --> 02:54:27.718]  They use television to basically condition us, and it's very widespread.
[02:54:28.385 --> 02:54:31.868]  And so when you watch television, you literally go into a sleep mode.
[02:54:31.908 --> 02:54:38.352]  Your brainwaves, for an adult after 30 minutes on average, with a child in about 5 minutes, these are scientific studies.
[02:54:38.372 --> 02:54:40.053]  You go into a sleep mode.
[02:54:40.414 --> 02:54:42.515]  You are mesmerized or daydreaming.
[02:54:43.136 --> 02:54:45.137]  And it all goes right into your subconscious.
[02:54:45.597 --> 02:54:47.358]  No critical thinking blocks it out.
[02:54:48.119 --> 02:54:49.320]  And it's mind control.
[02:54:50.243 --> 02:54:56.605]  And you need to be aware of that when you're watching one of my films, or you're watching Peter Jennings or Brian Williams.
[02:54:56.765 --> 02:54:59.445]  You need to be aware of that.
[02:55:00.265 --> 02:55:02.746]  And we try to get you to be aware of it.
[02:55:02.946 --> 02:55:04.246]  We say, don't believe anything we say here.
[02:55:04.306 --> 02:55:05.847]  Check it out for yourself.
[02:55:06.867 --> 02:55:07.827]  Great broadcast.
[02:55:07.887 --> 02:55:13.709]  I love all the affiliates, the sponsors, the great folks running the show, and of course you, the callers, the listeners.
[02:55:13.749 --> 02:55:14.629]  God bless you all.
[02:55:14.669 --> 02:55:17.069]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:55:17.549 --> 02:55:19.530]  Just in closing on this Thursday edition,
[02:55:20.393 --> 02:55:29.598]  I would challenge every single solitary one of you out there on the fruited plane to get involved and to realize that we can expose the lies.
[02:55:29.618 --> 02:55:32.479]  They've got to keep reapplying their propaganda.
[02:55:32.519 --> 02:55:37.342]  We've just got to expose it once for somebody, show them the big picture, and then they wake up for themselves.
