[00:00:05.516 --> 00:00:06.156]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.816 --> 00:00:07.876]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:09.737]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:11.177]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:12.878]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:17.139]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:21.820]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.441 --> 00:00:30.223]  There have been a lot of new developments concerning the fear-mongering hysteria...
[00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:43.321]  With the bird flu, the avian flu, it's now spread into other areas of Russia, as well as Greece, and an island off of Greece's coast.
[00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:48.943]  We have British officials saying it's not going to kill us this year.
[00:00:49.023 --> 00:00:52.484]  No, it's going to be next flu season, but don't worry.
[00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:54.805]  Run out and buy the pill.
[00:00:55.866 --> 00:01:01.368]  That Rumsfeld makes all the money off of, and so he can put five billion bucks in his pocket.
[00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.689]  So we'll get into that.
[00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:09.911]  Also coming up in the next hour, imminent domain in New Jersey.
[00:01:10.432 --> 00:01:13.153]  Now they just steal the land.
[00:01:14.013 --> 00:01:15.454]  That's the Newsmax headline.
[00:01:15.514 --> 00:01:18.855]  Well, that's what we've been screaming bloody murder about for years.
[00:01:20.034 --> 00:01:20.194]  I think?
[00:01:45.047 --> 00:01:55.112]  And then once they start court proceedings against you, if you want to fight for due process, they say, okay, when we beat you, we're going to charge you rent on your house.
[00:01:57.353 --> 00:02:02.476]  And so when they're done stealing your property, then they demand more than even the value of the property.
[00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:04.737]  It's unbelievable.
[00:02:06.298 --> 00:02:07.658]  It's unbelievable.
[00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.741]  And now all over the country, from South Texas to the coastline of New Jersey...
[00:02:13.843 --> 00:02:18.046]  They're coming right out, and boy, we've got the mainstream news articles here on it today.
[00:02:19.727 --> 00:02:22.069]  Old stack of them on what's happening in New Jersey.
[00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:24.010]  They're not even offering money.
[00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.171]  They just say, you know what?
[00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:29.114]  We've got a police department that's going to take you out of those houses.
[00:02:29.734 --> 00:02:30.695]  They'll follow orders.
[00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:33.657]  They'll eat their own guts and ask for seconds.
[00:02:34.958 --> 00:02:38.120]  They'll kill their mommy of order, too.
[00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.161]  That's the new Marine Corps...
[00:02:40.952 --> 00:02:42.133]  Brainwashing technique.
[00:02:42.474 --> 00:02:47.157]  Marine, when you go through that door and you see your mama, what are you going to do?
[00:02:47.217 --> 00:02:47.958]  What are you going to see?
[00:02:47.998 --> 00:02:48.758]  What's going to happen?
[00:02:48.798 --> 00:02:49.699]  What are you going to feel?
[00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:51.861]  Recoil, sir!
[00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:52.901]  Well, all right.
[00:02:53.562 --> 00:02:54.162]  That's good.
[00:02:54.222 --> 00:03:01.468]  Well, these guys are now our police, and they'll take any property, they'll break up any family, they'll follow any order.
[00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:05.691]  I mean, I believe if it was putting babies in blenders, they'd follow that order.
[00:03:05.971 --> 00:03:06.492]  Many of them.
[00:03:06.712 --> 00:03:08.353]  And I'm not trying to sound negative here.
[00:03:08.914 --> 00:03:10.354]  I'm not trying to sound mean here.
[00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:14.555]  I'm trying to illustrate how out of control all this is.
[00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:17.976]  So now, in New Jersey, they're just going to take it.
[00:03:19.936 --> 00:03:20.876]  So we're going to get into that.
[00:03:22.416 --> 00:03:29.098]  And of course, as I mentioned, bird flu virus revealed in two more Russian villages, also in Greece.
[00:03:29.978 --> 00:03:32.918]  Charlie Reese says, don't worry about the bird flu.
[00:03:32.938 --> 00:03:34.819]  And I agree with him.
[00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:36.299]  We'll read part of this editorial.
[00:03:37.305 --> 00:03:39.567]  From free market news, they're starting to get it.
[00:03:39.747 --> 00:03:42.209]  Iraq war was to destabilize oil.
[00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:45.791]  Well, yes, it wasn't about getting the oil to flow.
[00:03:46.572 --> 00:03:47.733]  It was about restricting it.
[00:03:47.773 --> 00:03:48.954]  There's too much oil.
[00:03:49.354 --> 00:03:51.235]  They've got to restrict it to stop the flow.
[00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:53.177]  That's their stated reason.
[00:03:54.678 --> 00:03:59.821]  Also, Colonel Roberts has written an article, martial law coming to a neighborhood near you.
[00:04:02.936 --> 00:04:11.443]  And Christian or not is not the question in an article by Chuck Baldwin that I do want to cover a little bit, but just about the true nature of Lord Bush.
[00:04:11.884 --> 00:04:20.131]  And by the way, nationwide poll finds 50% want Bush impeached over doctored WMD intelligence reports.
[00:04:21.532 --> 00:04:26.356]  But if you listen to the chief neocons on talk radio, I listened to some of it yesterday,
[00:04:27.356 --> 00:04:29.798]  It was never about WMDs.
[00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:37.562]  No, you didn't hear the President and Vice President and Defense Secretary and Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice and Wolfowitz say that.
[00:04:38.823 --> 00:04:39.884]  No, they never said that.
[00:04:39.964 --> 00:04:42.245]  It was about bringing democracy.
[00:04:42.265 --> 00:04:45.247]  And look at the great democracy.
[00:04:46.527 --> 00:04:49.269]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[00:04:49.329 --> 00:04:50.410]  I mean, this is incredible.
[00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.371]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:56.841]  Weird rumblings coming out of China, a new arms race.
[00:04:57.382 --> 00:04:59.003]  Lord Rumsfeld is concerned.
[00:04:59.023 --> 00:05:00.564]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.305 --> 00:05:05.187]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.427 --> 00:05:06.107]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.207 --> 00:05:06.988]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:12.031]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.372 --> 00:05:16.794]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.215 --> 00:05:21.197]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.217 --> 00:05:22.238]  The Constitution of the United States
[00:05:22.278 --> 00:05:23.078]  We're good to go.
[00:05:23.118 --> 00:05:23.999]  We're good to go.
[00:05:24.019 --> 00:05:24.819]  We're good to go.
[00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:25.420]  We're good to go.

[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:04.802]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:06:05.062 --> 00:06:08.564]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:08.664 --> 00:06:12.607]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.827 --> 00:06:18.990]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:27.315]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.715 --> 00:06:33.056]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:33.216 --> 00:06:36.997]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.357 --> 00:06:39.198]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:06:39.258 --> 00:06:41.418]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:41.678 --> 00:06:46.279]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:52.200]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:55.601 --> 00:06:56.902]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:56.962 --> 00:06:59.425]  Protect your family.
[00:07:00.746 --> 00:07:04.629]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:06.511]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:07:06.571 --> 00:07:07.832]  But not just any water.
[00:07:07.932 --> 00:07:12.136]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:07:12.196 --> 00:07:21.905]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:22.786]  We're good to go.
[00:07:37.082 --> 00:07:37.542]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:08:00.934 --> 00:08:05.977]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.337 --> 00:08:08.658]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.938 --> 00:08:27.328]  Well, the people of the United Kingdom are on the verge of physical revolt over the national ID card, the transponders going in their cars to tax and trace them and control their lives.
[00:08:28.231 --> 00:08:32.632]  The exact same systems are going in here, but the average American is totally unaware of it.
[00:08:33.133 --> 00:08:46.277]  Or if you read a mainstream news article about it, there are a few of them, they'll tell you how great it is, how wonderful it is, how being taxed and traced and regulated and having no privacy is just total freedom.
[00:08:48.958 --> 00:08:50.318]  So we'll be getting into that.
[00:08:50.758 --> 00:08:56.500]  Also, I want to kind of review what's happened in the last two and a half years since the glorious...
[00:08:57.499 --> 00:09:02.383]  Attack on Iraq that the neocons have been praising so much.
[00:09:02.403 --> 00:09:08.428]  We'll also get into the bird flu and talk about what's happening with the economy and these upcoming indictments.
[00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:11.851]  I mean, is this all hot air or is something really going to happen?
[00:09:14.433 --> 00:09:17.996]  We're going to have wide open phones for the full three hours today.
[00:09:18.016 --> 00:09:20.599]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:25.599 --> 00:09:27.941]  I was going to have two guests on today.
[00:09:28.682 --> 00:09:40.052]  I was going to have Carol Siegel, who had done an interview with several local papers, like the Star-Ledger, in his area of New Jersey.
[00:09:41.033 --> 00:09:48.820]  But since he did this interview a few days ago, we had set up the interview, and he just got word and got served...
[00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:53.523]  Just minutes ago, with the gag order.
[00:09:53.783 --> 00:10:00.168]  He'll be arrested if he talks about anything to the press, or if he has any free speech, or if he defends himself.
[00:10:00.849 --> 00:10:11.697]  So, no guests today, because your loving government has banned our guest from coming on the broadcast.
[00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:14.199]  How dare him talk to Newsmax?
[00:10:14.499 --> 00:10:16.380]  How dare him talk to the Star-Ledger?
[00:10:16.781 --> 00:10:19.763]  How dare him even defend himself in any way?
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:25.603]  But we do have the Newsmax and the Star-Ledger articles.
[00:10:26.003 --> 00:10:30.926]  Imminent domain in New Jersey, now they just steal the land.
[00:10:32.427 --> 00:10:34.029]  Terrell Siegel has a problem.
[00:10:34.069 --> 00:10:43.115]  He wants to build townhouses on six acres of land he owns in New Jersey Union Township and has contracted with a developer to build 100 townhouses there.
[00:10:46.983 --> 00:11:02.877]  But the township government wants to develop the property themselves, and incredibly, they have voted to take his land through the eminent domain process and let a local developer with political connections do the job.
[00:11:03.437 --> 00:11:05.319]  Folks, that is pure feudalism.
[00:11:05.359 --> 00:11:08.902]  That is just outright king rat total tyranny.
[00:11:09.943 --> 00:11:12.365]  That is third world banana republic.
[00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:14.547]  In fact, most banana republics aren't that bad.
[00:11:15.433 --> 00:11:18.661]  They want to steal my land, Siegel told the Newark Star-Ledger.
[00:11:19.182 --> 00:11:19.924]  Not anymore.
[00:11:19.964 --> 00:11:22.309]  You open your mouth, you're going to the Hooskow.
[00:11:24.053 --> 00:11:25.436]  What right do they have?
[00:11:26.678 --> 00:11:31.080]  When I intend to do the exact same thing they want to do with my property.
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:45.507]  According to the Star-Ledger, Siegel, a 65-year-old retired electrical engineer, has spent about $1.5 million to acquire the property over the past 10 years and has been dickering with the township officials over the past five years about his development plans.
[00:11:45.547 --> 00:11:52.871]  He claims negotiations fell apart after he refused to use the developers the township officials wanted him to use.
[00:11:53.491 --> 00:11:54.892]  Now let me just stop right there.
[00:11:54.932 --> 00:12:03.018]  Then they have a whole bunch of other examples of all over the town and all over the state where they just come in and say, you know what, we're not going to give you a red cent.
[00:12:03.358 --> 00:12:04.519]  We're just going to take it.
[00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:11.523]  And they don't claim there's a snail or a salamander or a golden cheek warbler bird.
[00:12:11.863 --> 00:12:13.885]  They don't claim there's a barn owl.
[00:12:14.205 --> 00:12:18.068]  They don't claim that there's a cougar or an endangered rattlesnake.
[00:12:19.148 --> 00:12:21.510]  They just say, hey, we're taking it.
[00:12:23.681 --> 00:12:26.403]  It's like the case down in Freeport, Texas.
[00:12:26.483 --> 00:12:28.265]  I mean, we have the family owner on.
[00:12:28.285 --> 00:12:30.206]  They make $40-plus million a year.
[00:12:30.246 --> 00:12:34.229]  It's not like they're just little blue-collar people that have always been pushed around.
[00:12:34.249 --> 00:12:39.593]  I mean, this is somebody who owns Western Seafood, Mr. Gore.
[00:12:40.935 --> 00:12:47.440]  And this local individual, Mr. Royal, one of the ExxonMobil heirs,
[00:12:50.669 --> 00:12:52.830]  Just wants it, and he's going to get it.
[00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.530]  It's right out in the open.
[00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:56.010]  It's the end of it.
[00:12:56.050 --> 00:12:57.071]  Hand over your property.
[00:12:57.111 --> 00:12:58.891]  We're building a luxury marina here.
[00:13:01.131 --> 00:13:03.652]  And, by the way, we ain't going to pay you nothing.
[00:13:03.672 --> 00:13:07.173]  I mean, this is in the Houston Chronicle.
[00:13:07.253 --> 00:13:08.493]  This is the new attitude.
[00:13:09.373 --> 00:13:11.474]  And don't think for a minute they're not setting precedents.
[00:13:11.894 --> 00:13:13.234]  It's meant to be arrogant.
[00:13:13.334 --> 00:13:14.695]  It's meant to be over the top.
[00:13:15.055 --> 00:13:16.275]  It's meant to be predatory.
[00:13:16.315 --> 00:13:17.895]  It's meant to blow you away.
[00:13:18.356 --> 00:13:20.156]  Everything is meant to blow you away.
[00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:27.693]  Former Health and Human Services Secretary on the national news saying every child needs an implantable chip.
[00:13:28.113 --> 00:13:32.195]  Time Magazine coming out and saying soon everyone will have a chip two days ago.
[00:13:32.635 --> 00:13:34.196]  That's meant to be bizarre.
[00:13:34.296 --> 00:13:36.657]  That's meant to make you feel weird.
[00:13:37.421 --> 00:13:42.185]  And then, they're already starting, you're a weirdo if you're against taking the land.
[00:13:42.505 --> 00:13:44.447]  You're a weirdo if you don't want the chip.
[00:13:44.507 --> 00:13:50.152]  And everybody's a weirdo because 99% of us are against the land takings in major poles.
[00:13:50.172 --> 00:13:53.054]  90 plus percent are against implantable microchips.
[00:13:53.294 --> 00:13:53.915]  They don't care.
[00:13:53.935 --> 00:13:57.678]  That tiny percent will sit up there and tell us, no, you're all crazy.
[00:13:58.516 --> 00:13:59.356]  You're all nuts!
[00:13:59.396 --> 00:14:00.997]  You don't like gun confiscation?
[00:14:01.357 --> 00:14:02.818]  You don't like open borders?
[00:14:03.358 --> 00:14:05.699]  You don't like genetic engineering of your food crops?
[00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.120]  Why, you're a bunch of lunatics!
[00:14:09.880 --> 00:14:16.043]  You don't like police in black masks busting down your doors in the middle of the night looking for narcotics their bosses shipped in to begin with?
[00:14:16.983 --> 00:14:19.064]  Why, you're some kind of crazy person!
[00:14:20.723 --> 00:14:22.464]  But here is a First Amendment story.
[00:14:22.544 --> 00:14:38.714]  I mean, gag orders were used in the past where somebody's being called in as a witness, and they're a witness to another witness whose wife is in danger, and quote, until the trial's over, you can't tell anybody any details of this case.
[00:14:41.096 --> 00:14:49.721]  Very specific, cloistered, small, delineated areas where this is supposed to be used.
[00:14:51.295 --> 00:14:51.515]  Nope.
[00:14:51.755 --> 00:14:57.738]  Now, we're taking your property, and if you open your mouth, we're going to send police over to arrest you.
[00:14:57.998 --> 00:15:00.200]  Do you understand, Mr. Siegel?
[00:15:02.801 --> 00:15:04.382]  And it goes on and on.
[00:15:08.163 --> 00:15:09.124]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:15:13.368 --> 00:15:14.749]  It just makes my blood boil.
[00:15:14.769 --> 00:15:16.109]  And there's a bunch of other examples.
[00:15:16.149 --> 00:15:20.952]  I mean, there are... We talked to a Reverend Smith of Love of Christ Church.
[00:15:22.513 --> 00:15:24.934]  And they've had the church for many, many years.
[00:15:25.054 --> 00:15:28.096]  And now they're ordering them to vacate the church.
[00:15:28.116 --> 00:15:29.877]  They're just going to take it for a development.
[00:15:30.077 --> 00:15:31.518]  This is in a nice area, by the way.
[00:15:32.378 --> 00:15:39.982]  And because he's been saying no, now they've brought in bulldozers and torn up the road into his church and will not let anyone into the church.
[00:15:41.778 --> 00:15:43.478]  And there's just example after example.
[00:15:43.518 --> 00:15:48.620]  It's a four-page article of what's happening in New Jersey.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:51.720]  I mean, everybody wonders, why do people love America?
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:53.020]  Why do people want to come here?
[00:15:53.441 --> 00:15:55.001]  What makes America America?
[00:15:55.381 --> 00:15:56.521]  And it's that Bill of Rights.
[00:15:56.581 --> 00:15:57.721]  It's that Constitution.
[00:15:57.802 --> 00:15:58.902]  It's that due process.
[00:15:59.222 --> 00:16:00.282]  It's property rights.
[00:16:00.342 --> 00:16:01.382]  It's the Second Amendment.
[00:16:01.702 --> 00:16:02.743]  It's states' rights.
[00:16:03.643 --> 00:16:09.084]  It's the Fourth Amendment against unlawful, illegal, unreasonable search and seizure.
[00:16:10.706 --> 00:16:25.394]  Everything, everything in this country that makes America, America, every foundation stone, every pillar, every leg that this country stands on is being systematically sawed away.
[00:16:25.714 --> 00:16:35.560]  You can't look at one right or one liberty or one freedom that they haven't now turned into a privilege, and then they say, by the way, we're revoking the privilege.
[00:16:36.491 --> 00:16:45.077]  And they've got an army of cops that are as dumb as dirt, just like the general public, who will tell you that all your God-given rights are a privilege, and they're revoking them.
[00:16:45.377 --> 00:16:47.819]  And they're as dumb as dirt, but you can't argue with them.
[00:16:48.039 --> 00:16:49.861]  It's like talking to a fence post.
[00:16:51.202 --> 00:16:52.823]  They don't know what the Bill of Rights is.
[00:16:53.143 --> 00:16:55.064]  They don't know how many continents there are.
[00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:56.906]  They don't know how many state capitals.
[00:16:56.986 --> 00:16:59.107]  I mean, they can't even tell you their own state capital at the time.
[00:16:59.287 --> 00:17:00.909]  But hey, it's not like cops are dumb.
[00:17:01.109 --> 00:17:02.650]  The general public's dumb as dirt.
[00:17:05.043 --> 00:17:07.945]  Most high school seniors can't tell you who the vice president is.
[00:17:08.045 --> 00:17:09.925]  And I'm not sitting here again tooting my horn.
[00:17:10.966 --> 00:17:12.087]  Ooh, I know this stuff.
[00:17:12.107 --> 00:17:12.827]  And ooh, you don't.
[00:17:13.207 --> 00:17:14.408]  It's scary.
[00:17:14.808 --> 00:17:17.109]  Because all these people, though, got an opinion.
[00:17:19.570 --> 00:17:24.293]  And it just makes my blood boil that we can't even interview Mr. Siegel.
[00:17:25.953 --> 00:17:29.215]  Because the judge said, you keep your mouth shut about this.
[00:17:29.255 --> 00:17:32.817]  You don't talk to another newspaper and expose us
[00:17:33.877 --> 00:17:35.198]  And that's like the Soviet Union.
[00:17:35.638 --> 00:17:36.939]  We're going to prosecute you.
[00:17:36.959 --> 00:17:38.980]  We're going to come after your property.
[00:17:40.161 --> 00:17:42.902]  There's no more pure form of prosecution.
[00:17:42.943 --> 00:17:43.903]  It's total siege.
[00:17:44.203 --> 00:17:45.644]  We're going to loot you, buddy.
[00:17:46.305 --> 00:17:48.286]  And there isn't a thing you're going to do about it.
[00:17:48.306 --> 00:17:50.187]  Because I've got black robes on.
[00:17:51.087 --> 00:17:53.629]  And we're all making a lot of money right now.
[00:17:54.129 --> 00:17:55.570]  We're a bunch of bandits.
[00:17:56.511 --> 00:17:58.812]  And you're going to keep your mouth shut, boy.
[00:17:59.332 --> 00:18:00.113]  You got that?
[00:18:02.645 --> 00:18:12.476]  You're going to let us do this, and you're going to keep your... It's just like when somebody walks into a bank and pulls out their gun and says, Everybody lay down on the floor and keep your mouths shut, and this isn't going to hurt a bit.
[00:18:12.756 --> 00:18:15.760]  But if any of you pop your heads up, it's going to mean trouble.
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:20.245]  Everybody keep your mouths shut and get down on the ground and take it!
[00:18:22.947 --> 00:18:24.189]  It boils down to that.
[00:18:26.326 --> 00:18:33.209]  And every day I see articles from all over the country, from Oregon to Florida, where they're grabbing property and they're not even paying you for it.
[00:18:34.049 --> 00:18:40.071]  Like the Supreme Court ruling three years ago that, oh, we don't have to pay you just compensation if it's the government taking your land.
[00:18:42.072 --> 00:18:45.173]  I mean, even in Russia, they'll pay you now if they take your land.
[00:18:45.553 --> 00:18:48.034]  Even in Venezuela, they pay you if they take your land.
[00:18:50.055 --> 00:18:53.296]  I mean, only in places like communist China or maybe Cuba.
[00:18:54.696 --> 00:18:57.357]  Do they just grab whatever they want whenever they want?
[00:18:57.917 --> 00:19:07.101]  But now in the home of the coward and the home of the slave, land of the slave and home of the slave, I mean, whatever you want to call it, folks, it's pathetic.
[00:19:09.162 --> 00:19:11.243]  And I know so many people in Central Texas.
[00:19:12.103 --> 00:19:13.484]  They use the old scam here.
[00:19:13.544 --> 00:19:15.264]  They say, oh, it's for environmental reasons.
[00:19:15.564 --> 00:19:17.025]  Then they won't let you use your property.
[00:19:17.085 --> 00:19:19.146]  Five years later, you sell for pennies on the dollar.
[00:19:20.018 --> 00:19:28.664]  Some big bond package, they buy it from you, 15,000 acres in one swath, and then they turn around, take all the restrictions off, and sell it to their cronies.
[00:19:28.984 --> 00:19:31.586]  Golf courses, hotels, luxury homes.
[00:19:34.988 --> 00:19:38.250]  Within a few years of selling the property for pennies on the dollar, that stuff's...
[00:19:39.036 --> 00:19:42.017]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:19:42.037 --> 00:19:44.457]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[00:20:08.863 --> 00:20:16.749]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[00:20:16.969 --> 00:20:19.612]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed, Inc.'
[00:20:19.592 --> 00:20:20.993]  's patented methodology.
[00:20:21.173 --> 00:20:28.078]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects.
[00:20:28.358 --> 00:20:31.341]  At a physician's office, Star Wars technology at its best.
[00:20:31.701 --> 00:20:32.902]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[00:20:33.142 --> 00:20:33.462]  That's 702-953-0267.

[00:20:34.843 --> 00:20:36.644]  That's www.lasemedinc.com.
[00:20:36.664 --> 00:20:38.224]  Or call LASEMED at 702-953-0267 today.
[00:21:06.822 --> 00:21:08.924]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[00:21:09.405 --> 00:21:10.105]  One and the same.
[00:21:10.826 --> 00:21:14.810]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:21:21.078 --> 00:21:24.179]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:21:24.459 --> 00:21:25.880]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.801]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:21:30.061 --> 00:21:32.142]  Here is reality.
[00:21:32.522 --> 00:21:36.104]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:21:36.564 --> 00:21:40.245]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:21:40.806 --> 00:21:43.246]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[00:21:44.969 --> 00:21:45.189]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[00:22:01.437 --> 00:22:03.038]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:07.301]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:22:07.441 --> 00:22:10.303]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:22:10.403 --> 00:22:17.068]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:17.288 --> 00:22:18.229]  We're good to go.
[00:22:32.745 --> 00:22:40.189]  Or order a two-pack of black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:23:01.098 --> 00:23:01.898]  Attention drivers.
[00:23:02.219 --> 00:23:04.740]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.362]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[00:23:08.682 --> 00:23:13.545]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents and fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[00:23:13.905 --> 00:23:17.567]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[00:23:17.987 --> 00:23:19.048]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[00:23:19.348 --> 00:23:22.330]  Poor mileage and reduced performance in a time of record fuel prices.
[00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:23.311]  There is an answer.
[00:23:23.591 --> 00:23:29.715]  Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.
[00:23:29.955 --> 00:23:36.659]  Plus, a special mileage improver designed and fleet tested by a major oil company to improve mileage even on new cars by up to 4%.
[00:23:36.999 --> 00:23:39.601]  The mileage improvement lasts for an entire oil change.
[00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:43.864]  So quit wasting unburned fuel and get more when you treat your car right with Protecta.

[00:23:53.849 --> 00:23:54.049]  That's 888-873-7371.
[00:23:54.069 --> 00:23:57.651]  All right, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.441]  Robert, Alex, Mike, John, Brad, Kevin, many others.
[00:24:20.623 --> 00:24:22.463]  We have a right to be angry.
[00:24:22.603 --> 00:24:25.164]  We are being systematically enslaved.
[00:24:26.805 --> 00:24:28.985]  This is the norm in human history.
[00:24:30.366 --> 00:24:33.887]  Freedom is that incredibly rare jewel.
[00:24:35.207 --> 00:24:37.328]  That unknown country.
[00:24:37.408 --> 00:24:40.109]  That elusive prize.
[00:24:42.205 --> 00:24:48.710]  And we've taken it for granted in private criminal interest to seize control of the government for now over 80 years.
[00:24:49.391 --> 00:24:53.994]  They have total control of the states and the federal government.
[00:24:54.995 --> 00:25:02.561]  They are brainwashing the public to accept torture and secret arrest and secret execution and loss of property rights and forced drugging.
[00:25:03.202 --> 00:25:05.724]  They are giving us their values.
[00:25:05.764 --> 00:25:07.525]  They're telling us evil is good.
[00:25:08.106 --> 00:25:09.647]  They're warping our minds.
[00:25:11.969 --> 00:25:16.292]  The good news is people are waking up and getting angry and getting concerned.
[00:25:17.933 --> 00:25:29.900]  But we should all be upset that under the Patriot Act, if they're, quote, investigating you for terrorism, and that could be knock-off Rubik's Cubes or potless bars or county commissioners and bed-rigging.
[00:25:30.835 --> 00:25:35.380]  I mean, that could be homeless people sleeping by the bus station, being charged under the Patriot Act.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:36.561]  I mean, they use it all the time.
[00:25:36.841 --> 00:25:40.865]  When you go get a bank account or try to buy a used car, Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
[00:25:41.305 --> 00:25:43.367]  Oh, but it's never been used against a citizen.
[00:25:43.528 --> 00:25:43.868]  Bull.
[00:25:48.272 --> 00:25:55.099]  Meanwhile, the government is doing everything they can to beef up their oppressive military forces against the American people.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:04.367]  And I know the little neocon followers, as we're being oppressed by our own military and government, they're going to be going, I support the troops in our neighborhood!
[00:26:04.387 --> 00:26:05.628]  I support them!
[00:26:05.668 --> 00:26:07.150]  Look, you don't support the troops!
[00:26:07.410 --> 00:26:10.253]  You've got to support the troops while they're taking our goods!
[00:26:11.474 --> 00:26:21.143]  I mean, you don't think they just send our troops out all over the country for the last 15 years and train them in gun confiscation and tell them it's for domestic gun confiscation for nothing, do you?
[00:26:22.569 --> 00:26:23.770]  I mean, we have it on video.
[00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:26.651]  I've been there many times, all over the country.
[00:26:26.951 --> 00:26:30.894]  And our listeners have been there many more times and shot video of it, and we put it in the films.
[00:26:33.355 --> 00:26:40.058]  That's why I was that nut on the air screaming about urban warfare training and drills to push you in camps and drills to take your guns.
[00:26:40.399 --> 00:26:42.400]  And what did you see happen in New Orleans?
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:50.184]  Foreign troops, gun confiscation, foreign mercenaries from Israel, England, you name it, the Netherlands, Mexico.
[00:26:51.907 --> 00:26:53.388]  All these precedents being set.
[00:26:53.428 --> 00:26:56.331]  You see, next time, well, we had foreign troops here before.
[00:26:56.691 --> 00:26:57.732]  It ain't no big deal.
[00:26:57.932 --> 00:26:59.133]  You're being acclimated.
[00:26:59.173 --> 00:27:00.114]  You're being conditioned.
[00:27:00.294 --> 00:27:02.856]  Do you like being treated like a domesticated animal?
[00:27:03.096 --> 00:27:04.398]  Do you like being broken?
[00:27:04.418 --> 00:27:05.879]  Do you like it?
[00:27:07.300 --> 00:27:08.201]  It's not funny!
[00:27:10.423 --> 00:27:13.665]  And, you know, I talk about how we stand on the shoulders of those that came before us.
[00:27:14.046 --> 00:27:16.828]  A better example is a chain, an endless chain.
[00:27:19.542 --> 00:27:23.584]  The average father in America only spends a few minutes with his son or daughter.
[00:27:24.465 --> 00:27:26.326]  The average mother spends a little bit more time.
[00:27:28.707 --> 00:27:33.049]  And we've all got to spend more time with our children, and we've got to keep the chain connected.
[00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:38.852]  I mean, already, I don't know how to fix as many things as my father does.
[00:27:38.872 --> 00:27:43.575]  I don't know how to skin a deer as good as he does.
[00:27:43.595 --> 00:27:45.656]  I can shoot a lot better than he can.
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:51.124]  The point is, and then my father can't do as much as his dad could do.
[00:27:53.046 --> 00:28:01.633]  I mean, just that chain in self-reliance and self-sufficiency and independence is getting weaker and weaker and weaker.
[00:28:01.873 --> 00:28:02.974]  And I'm better than most.
[00:28:07.958 --> 00:28:09.159]  And that's just one example.
[00:28:09.199 --> 00:28:10.560]  I mean, this is an endless chain.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:13.403]  Do you realize that the information that was passed on
[00:28:14.844 --> 00:28:27.169]  In a cave 6,000 years ago in Germany, if you're of German descent, has literally been passed on man to man, down the line, all the way to you.
[00:28:28.792 --> 00:28:47.092]  That if you're a black man that literally thousands of years of training and everything has been passed down and then you lost that training, you lost that when they killed the strongest men and loaded you on the slave ships and half your population died just in transit on the coffin ships.
[00:28:48.982 --> 00:28:51.502]  And then now we see an accelerated program of that.
[00:28:51.723 --> 00:29:01.704]  The actual handbooks at the University of Texas, I even own one of the textbooks, says the family is a disease and must be eradicated.
[00:29:01.944 --> 00:29:15.947]  They openly are destroying the family so that all of these thousands of years of training and humanity and family, that unbroken chain, and look what happens to communities when that chain is broken.
[00:29:17.563 --> 00:29:20.064]  The black community with 90 plus percent illegitimacy.
[00:29:21.304 --> 00:29:22.284]  Look at all the other communities.
[00:29:22.324 --> 00:29:25.265]  Hispanic, white, illegitimacy exploding.
[00:29:25.505 --> 00:29:28.566]  This is scientifically crafted.
[00:29:28.886 --> 00:29:33.268]  And it sends me into a red rage to see that chain being broken.
[00:29:33.488 --> 00:29:34.748]  I feel that chain.
[00:29:35.008 --> 00:29:36.449]  I feel part of that chain.
[00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:39.770]  It really is immortality, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:44.771]  It is a true form of immortality.
[00:29:44.811 --> 00:29:47.132]  I'll talk about it when we get back, and we'll take your calls.
[00:29:48.058 --> 00:29:49.660]  It is blasphemous what they're doing.
[00:29:51.882 --> 00:29:52.802]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.283 --> 00:29:54.864]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.884 --> 00:29:58.488]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.917 --> 00:30:06.560]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:07.340]  have diabetes.
[00:30:07.681 --> 00:30:14.625]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[00:30:14.765 --> 00:30:19.288]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[00:30:19.508 --> 00:30:22.310]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[00:31:22.075 --> 00:31:26.416]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.616 --> 00:31:34.957]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:31:35.237 --> 00:31:41.599]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[00:32:01.543 --> 00:32:03.084]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:32:03.224 --> 00:32:04.345]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:04.545 --> 00:32:07.946]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:08.066 --> 00:32:08.506]  Phenol?
[00:32:08.807 --> 00:32:15.930]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:20.332]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:20.432 --> 00:32:20.872]  Fragrance?
[00:32:21.252 --> 00:32:26.016]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:26.136 --> 00:32:30.839]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.621]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:32:33.862 --> 00:32:37.284]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:32:37.424 --> 00:32:40.967]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.342]  I hate to give you a news flash, but we're all going to die.
[00:33:16.784 --> 00:33:18.965]  It seems like yesterday I was five years old.
[00:33:21.487 --> 00:33:23.248]  And, you know, now I'm married with children.
[00:33:24.148 --> 00:33:26.190]  And the years just speed past.
[00:33:26.270 --> 00:33:31.313]  I mean, I've got one grandparent left who I love so much, and I know she won't be here forever.
[00:33:32.113 --> 00:33:34.595]  And I've been thinking about how I need to spend more time with her.
[00:33:35.996 --> 00:33:47.142]  To literally complete the cycle, to literally learn more about my family, to know that individual better.
[00:33:47.722 --> 00:33:51.504]  That's what humanity is, is spending time with your family.
[00:33:52.885 --> 00:34:02.730]  Humanity is training your children how to read and write and how to think and to read them history at their bedside.
[00:34:04.901 --> 00:34:11.463]  And to teach them how to fish and how to hunt and how to climb mountains.
[00:34:11.483 --> 00:34:14.984]  You know, it's physical, it's mental, it's spiritual.
[00:34:15.204 --> 00:34:16.925]  Number one, a relationship with God.
[00:34:17.905 --> 00:34:24.047]  And instead, parents teach their kids how to put on an orange jersey with a longhorn symbol on it.
[00:34:25.408 --> 00:34:29.789]  And they teach them how to go down and stand in line and be searched by police and
[00:34:31.289 --> 00:34:57.681]  How to go into a stadium modeled after the Circus Maximus in Rome, and how to go sit there and be a spectator and scream and yell as some arrogant athletes run into each other, who then become even more arrogant athletes in the NFL, snorting cocaine and having giant group sex parties on their...
[00:34:59.187 --> 00:34:59.988]  Just all of it.
[00:35:00.448 --> 00:35:01.749]  I heard Rush Limbaugh make a joke about it.
[00:35:01.769 --> 00:35:02.690]  He wishes he could be there.
[00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:04.591]  He's so Christian and conservative.
[00:35:05.291 --> 00:35:13.337]  The point is, is that I'm not even knocking all of it.
[00:35:13.357 --> 00:35:14.058]  I mean sports.
[00:35:14.518 --> 00:35:18.281]  Obviously, I'm knocking the group sex parties, allegedly, you know, with the Vikings.
[00:35:19.782 --> 00:35:19.922]  But...
[00:35:21.545 --> 00:35:23.146]  Look, they know you're primitive.
[00:35:23.206 --> 00:35:30.351]  They know you have these needs to be in a tribe, and they create this little net, this little trap.
[00:35:33.032 --> 00:35:34.133]  It's like a fish trap.
[00:35:34.753 --> 00:35:41.097]  It looks like a nice little hole for the fish to stay in, and it's got a piece of bait in there, and you go in there, you're trapped.
[00:35:41.458 --> 00:35:50.383]  They take all these primitive energies, all these things that are supposed to be in your local community, your neighborhood, your farming co-op,
[00:35:51.863 --> 00:36:01.214]  They take all of this humanity and they just focus it all into this dead end of simulated tribalism.
[00:36:03.556 --> 00:36:08.840]  I mean, people in line at the grocery store, they don't talk about eminent domain and how they're going to lose their private property.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.282]  They don't talk about how the dollar's been devalued by 45%.
[00:36:11.843 --> 00:36:17.367]  They don't talk about how the border's wide open and groups are coming in openly saying they're going to take over the U.S.
[00:36:17.947 --> 00:36:21.710]  They don't talk about how cancer viruses are in the vaccines they're giving their children.
[00:36:22.191 --> 00:36:24.673]  They don't talk about how cancer's up over 500%.
[00:36:25.934 --> 00:36:28.616]  They don't talk about all these serious things.
[00:36:29.364 --> 00:36:30.966]  How we're being de-industrialized.
[00:36:31.026 --> 00:36:36.193]  How GM is selling off its most profitable divisions just to survive.
[00:36:36.213 --> 00:36:38.215]  They don't talk about any of that.
[00:36:38.275 --> 00:36:40.418]  That's what our forefathers talked about.
[00:36:41.078 --> 00:36:46.000]  You know what people talked about 50 years ago, 100 years ago, around the dinner table every night?
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:37:00.626]  The children sat there listening, but Grandpa and his three sons and the whole family in there at the big table, at the big farmhouse, they all sat there and they talked about how we don't trust the tax assessors.
[00:37:00.666 --> 00:37:01.826]  The government's corrupt.
[00:37:02.166 --> 00:37:03.687]  We've got to hoard our freedom.
[00:37:04.067 --> 00:37:05.448]  We've got to defend ourselves.
[00:37:05.508 --> 00:37:06.788]  We've got to go into town.
[00:37:07.068 --> 00:37:10.510]  We've got to make sure that corrupt mayor doesn't steal the election again.
[00:37:11.210 --> 00:37:18.638]  I'm going to go in there and I'm going to insist and we're going to take our guns to town and we're going to make sure they don't stop the ballot box again.
[00:37:18.658 --> 00:37:20.941]  I mean, that's all people talked about.
[00:37:21.221 --> 00:37:24.285]  You ought to read the inserts and what's been written into the family Bibles.
[00:37:24.605 --> 00:37:26.447]  You ought to read the diaries of people.
[00:37:27.319 --> 00:37:32.763]  It was not, gee, I hope I get to go to the baseball game.
[00:37:33.564 --> 00:37:35.865]  Oh, I sure hope the baseball team wins.
[00:37:36.125 --> 00:37:39.268]  Why do you think we got so much, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:37:39.508 --> 00:37:45.152]  Because we had forefathers that were willing to fight and die to preserve it for their posterity.
[00:37:45.312 --> 00:37:50.135]  Because they knew, it's all they talked about, that they were part of this chain.
[00:37:50.656 --> 00:37:55.059]  That their strength, their willingness to sacrifice, that their honor,
[00:37:55.739 --> 00:37:58.181]  Literally was part of something larger.
[00:37:59.362 --> 00:38:00.523]  You've got to be careful here.
[00:38:00.863 --> 00:38:02.825]  The New World Order manipulates this as well.
[00:38:02.865 --> 00:38:04.306]  They're masters at counterfeits.
[00:38:05.367 --> 00:38:09.390]  They know that one of the strongest instincts is preservation.
[00:38:10.691 --> 00:38:16.756]  And they know that one of the strongest instincts is self-sacrifice for the preservation of the tribe.
[00:38:17.357 --> 00:38:19.038]  They know that is the penultimate instinct.
[00:38:19.731 --> 00:38:20.772]  Ultimate drive.
[00:38:21.352 --> 00:38:22.852]  Stronger than the sex drive.
[00:38:22.933 --> 00:38:24.753]  Stronger than all of it.
[00:38:25.173 --> 00:38:35.118]  It is the survival of the already invested in, already grown, already developed tribe.
[00:38:37.639 --> 00:38:39.940]  And so they get you to give your money to the Red Cross.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:42.261]  It openly uses it to give it to anti-gun groups.
[00:38:42.681 --> 00:38:44.362]  But you just want to feel good and give it to them.
[00:38:46.077 --> 00:38:51.639]  They misdirect your energies into go join the military and go fight, sacrifice for America.
[00:38:51.859 --> 00:38:52.479]  But you're not.
[00:38:52.539 --> 00:38:58.882]  The very people that sent you over there are openly writing white papers on how to shut this country down, and they're doing it.
[00:38:59.962 --> 00:39:02.943]  So see, they can misdirect that chain.
[00:39:03.952 --> 00:39:08.296]  Oh, your great-grandfather served in the Marine Corps, and you're going to serve in it.
[00:39:08.336 --> 00:39:13.781]  You know, all the Marine Corps ads are being part of this big history and being part of this whole chain.
[00:39:14.221 --> 00:39:19.946]  But see, that chain's been taken over, and now they're sort of replacing it with poisonous links.
[00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:22.408]  It's a fraud.
[00:39:22.448 --> 00:39:28.353]  They've grafted on to the vine, onto this grape vine, a poisonous grape.
[00:39:30.382 --> 00:39:31.723]  That's why they went along with Hitler.
[00:39:31.763 --> 00:39:33.984]  Why, he said, you swear allegiance to me and the army.
[00:39:34.344 --> 00:39:37.466]  And why, if you're patriotic and you love Deutschland, you love me.
[00:39:37.826 --> 00:39:42.629]  Okay, we better not question Hitler then, because he's our leader and we've got to be patriotic.
[00:39:44.631 --> 00:39:48.913]  In America, it's about being patriotic to the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:39:48.993 --> 00:39:49.994]  That's America.
[00:39:50.474 --> 00:39:58.339]  Not Bill Clinton, not Al Gore, not John Kerry, and not George, I want open borders, I want abortionists in the...
[00:40:00.286 --> 00:40:02.748]  You know, in federal judgeships, W. Bush.
[00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:08.292]  And so I want everybody to think about that chain.
[00:40:11.894 --> 00:40:26.024]  Having children isn't just having children, handing them over to the government, handing them over to preschool, handing them over and then getting home at 6 o'clock at night and watching two or three TV shows and
[00:40:26.962 --> 00:40:30.963]  And then putting your kids to bed and then getting up in the morning and never talking to them.
[00:40:31.904 --> 00:40:34.924]  Or sitting around talking about the TV show with your children.
[00:40:35.425 --> 00:40:39.286]  Oh, I like this person on the TV show, or I like that person.
[00:40:39.626 --> 00:40:44.487]  Letting the government set the compass of your children's hearts and minds and destiny.
[00:40:47.088 --> 00:40:50.329]  King Solomon likened children to arrows.
[00:40:51.733 --> 00:40:53.554]  And you've got to forge that arrow.
[00:40:53.614 --> 00:40:56.656]  You've got to produce that arrow.
[00:40:56.696 --> 00:40:57.996]  Make it straight and strong.
[00:40:58.036 --> 00:40:59.958]  You've got to put the feathers on it.
[00:41:00.298 --> 00:41:02.599]  You've got to put a strong pointed tip on it.
[00:41:03.139 --> 00:41:04.020]  Straight and strong.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.921]  And you've got to aim it, and you've got to launch it.
[00:41:08.042 --> 00:41:17.107]  Because once they're past the age of about 10, folks, and a lot of evidence shows 5 is when the brain's really wired, you've launched the arrow.
[00:41:20.108 --> 00:41:21.069]  And then they're gone.
[00:41:23.899 --> 00:41:28.220]  I mean, that's what human societies are all about.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:40.263]  It's about families, and it's about standing up against tyranny, and it's about having tribal instincts to defend your people and to defend their freedoms.
[00:41:41.283 --> 00:41:42.263]  That's what it's about.
[00:41:42.303 --> 00:41:48.785]  It is not about being a bunch of perfumed, oiled,
[00:41:52.188 --> 00:41:57.294]  Dolled up, prancing, self-centered, mummy people.
[00:41:59.476 --> 00:42:01.658]  It is not about strutting around.
[00:42:01.678 --> 00:42:04.982]  I mean, there are so many men out there who think they're men.
[00:42:05.022 --> 00:42:07.204]  They think a man is riding a big motorcycle.
[00:42:07.584 --> 00:42:10.007]  They think being a man is having a bunch of tattoos.
[00:42:10.327 --> 00:42:14.692]  They think being a man is strutting around, bugging their eyes out, acting tough.
[00:42:15.555 --> 00:42:17.796]  And that is not what being a man is about.
[00:42:17.856 --> 00:42:21.038]  Being a man is about working your butt off for your family.
[00:42:21.338 --> 00:42:23.439]  Being a man is about educating your children.
[00:42:23.739 --> 00:42:27.261]  Being a man is about not groveling to corrupt government.
[00:42:27.821 --> 00:42:30.603]  Being a man is about being involved in your community.
[00:42:32.504 --> 00:42:35.045]  And I'm not saying you're a wimp if you ride a motorcycle.
[00:42:35.085 --> 00:42:36.986]  I'm not saying you're a wimp if you got tattoos.
[00:42:37.266 --> 00:42:39.127]  But we all know the type I'm talking about.
[00:42:40.888 --> 00:42:45.230]  I mean, if your dog does something in their yard, they get violently angry
[00:42:46.098 --> 00:42:50.522]  Well, they're more than willing to scream and yell at somebody who cuts them off at a red light.
[00:42:50.922 --> 00:42:58.649]  But a cop walks over to them and starts questioning them about something or pulls them over, they turn into little bitty babies.
[00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:00.991]  They're cowards, folks.
[00:43:01.812 --> 00:43:03.934]  They're big, fat cowards.
[00:43:03.974 --> 00:43:08.938]  I mean, how many times have I seen one of these guys coming out of a store with a case of beer in their hands...
[00:43:09.719 --> 00:43:18.446]  And their woman's sitting up in the truck real close to them, and they swagger around acting all tough, and there's sports stickers all over their car.
[00:43:20.287 --> 00:43:27.713]  And then you see them across the street, you know, with their kids, and their kids have got their pants hanging down around their ankles in the gang member mode.
[00:43:28.033 --> 00:43:30.015]  They're stupid, gibbering idiots.
[00:43:31.956 --> 00:43:33.838]  They totally disrespect their parents.
[00:43:34.098 --> 00:43:35.359]  They're going to fall apart.
[00:43:35.579 --> 00:43:37.801]  They're going to end up in a private Wackenhut prison.
[00:43:38.484 --> 00:43:45.847]  I want to walk up and punch that good old boy, Billy Bad Butt, right in the nose and just tell him to wake up!
[00:43:51.850 --> 00:43:59.814]  Most of these men, folks, sit there and watch football while their kids are in the next room playing Defense Department-developed brainwashing games.
[00:44:00.274 --> 00:44:03.015]  By the way, folks, I know people inside Microsoft and Xbox.
[00:44:03.295 --> 00:44:04.576]  Believe me, it's mind control.
[00:44:05.356 --> 00:44:06.697]  If I could only tell you what I know.
[00:44:07.463 --> 00:44:10.365]  I'm sworn to secrecy on this particular issue.
[00:44:10.385 --> 00:44:12.285]  I've already told you too much.
[00:44:12.866 --> 00:44:14.306]  But you know it's mind control.
[00:44:14.927 --> 00:44:18.028]  Your kid's in the next room doing simulated murders of patriots.
[00:44:18.929 --> 00:44:20.229]  Thousands of murders a day.
[00:44:20.249 --> 00:44:22.711]  They simulate murdering and killing American citizens.
[00:44:23.211 --> 00:44:25.712]  Most of these military video games are along those lines now.
[00:44:26.032 --> 00:44:31.975]  Meanwhile, you're sitting in the easy chair, getting mad with a curve's lot, going, what's wrong with you?
[00:44:32.015 --> 00:44:33.036]  You didn't make it in.
[00:44:34.542 --> 00:44:41.563]  You're sitting there looking at a catalog thinking, I'd have self-worth if I could just have this jewelry, I'd be happy.
[00:44:41.603 --> 00:44:43.024]  That'd fill the hole in my heart.
[00:44:43.804 --> 00:44:46.184]  No, you've got a hole in your heart because you don't love God.
[00:44:46.624 --> 00:44:49.165]  All you do is you love yourself, so you're going to lose yourself.
[00:44:49.525 --> 00:44:52.746]  And you're mad deep down because you know your husband's a big fat wimp.
[00:44:53.986 --> 00:45:00.107]  No matter how much he goes to Gold's Gym and how much weights he lifts so he can strut around acting tough.
[00:45:02.293 --> 00:45:05.015]  Now, I know I'm really preaching, folks, and I'm just tired of it.
[00:45:06.016 --> 00:45:06.756]  I'm tired of it.
[00:45:07.317 --> 00:45:10.739]  We are getting softer and stupider, myself included, every day.
[00:45:11.479 --> 00:45:13.040]  We're getting more and more pathetic.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:17.283]  I mean, people really did used to get up at 4 a.m.
[00:45:17.323 --> 00:45:18.344]  and work until sunset.
[00:45:18.644 --> 00:45:20.365]  People really did used to stand up.
[00:45:20.966 --> 00:45:25.489]  And if a politician told them they were a slave, I mean, it would turn into a gun battle.
[00:45:26.559 --> 00:45:28.660]  That's why we have all this milk and honey.
[00:45:29.221 --> 00:45:42.089]  If I hear one more yuppie or one more good old boy or one more neocon with all their Rolex jewelry right around their Cadillacs, one more of you walks up to me in a parking lot and goes, stuff ain't that bad, stuff's doing real good.
[00:45:44.170 --> 00:45:46.492]  Why, you know, the government gave us all this.
[00:45:46.532 --> 00:45:49.214]  The government has been feeding off of all of this.
[00:45:49.754 --> 00:45:52.636]  The government's been destroying everything America was.
[00:45:53.788 --> 00:46:01.652]  I'm so sick of watching a pack of criminals that have seized control of our military and our corporations and our industrial might.
[00:46:04.374 --> 00:46:05.114]  I'm tired of it.
[00:46:05.915 --> 00:46:08.276]  And using us up to set up a world government.
[00:46:08.636 --> 00:46:11.898]  Using the energies of America to destroy America.
[00:46:14.039 --> 00:46:15.780]  I've likened it to an egg.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.861]  The egg gets fertilized.
[00:46:17.901 --> 00:46:19.262]  Let's say a crocodile egg.
[00:46:20.202 --> 00:46:21.323]  And we are the...
[00:46:24.085 --> 00:46:25.166]  We are the food supply.
[00:46:25.186 --> 00:46:36.733]  That embryo grows, and it feeds on the food supply.
[00:46:36.753 --> 00:46:41.336]  And then it busts out of the egg, and it's done with the egg.
[00:46:41.376 --> 00:46:42.837]  Well, that's what America's turned into.
[00:46:42.857 --> 00:46:46.700]  We're just a food supply to these people.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:56.968]  And they're using us up and dismantling us as fast as they can and transferring everything to China and Europe and openly writing papers about it and laughing at us and calling us slaves.
[00:46:57.589 --> 00:47:02.473]  I mean, as a man, folks, to know a bunch of sniveling blue-blood technocrats...
[00:47:04.028 --> 00:47:27.457]  Sit up there and call me a slave and sit up there and laugh at you and sit up there and know that you're so hooked on football and so hooked on acting tough and so hooked on swaggering and so hooked on these deformed images of what it is to be a man that you don't even care that people are calling you slaves and taking everything you've got.
[00:47:30.382 --> 00:47:31.463]  And you don't care, do you?
[00:47:31.903 --> 00:47:35.005]  All you care about is the accursed UT Longhorns.
[00:47:36.846 --> 00:47:39.228]  And I say accursed because it is a religion.
[00:47:39.568 --> 00:47:41.490]  These people don't love their own children.
[00:47:42.670 --> 00:47:44.912]  They love the UT Longhorns here locally.
[00:47:45.973 --> 00:47:47.053]  And their self-worth.
[00:47:47.193 --> 00:47:49.575]  I'm feeling real good right now, Alex.
[00:47:50.296 --> 00:47:56.620]  I just can't worry about politics right now because the horns are on a streak.
[00:47:57.583 --> 00:48:04.685]  Your self-worth is tied up with some football team with a bunch of spoiled brats that could care less about you?
[00:48:04.705 --> 00:48:10.467]  I mean, that's your self-worth.
[00:48:10.507 --> 00:48:13.587]  Your self-worth isn't that you raise your children right.
[00:48:13.908 --> 00:48:20.409]  Your self-worth isn't that you defended the Second Amendment or that you defended the First Amendment or that you defended anything that this country's made of.
[00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:25.891]  No, your self-worth is strutting around being a
[00:48:26.926 --> 00:48:34.391]  A weak chicken leg, just a chicken-necked, chicken-legged, bug-eyed moron.
[00:48:36.132 --> 00:48:37.453]  You are pathetic.
[00:48:38.914 --> 00:48:42.716]  And I'm sorry, just go read Patrick Henry's famous give me liberty or give me death speech.
[00:48:42.896 --> 00:48:44.177]  The war has already begun.
[00:48:45.729 --> 00:48:48.752]  I mean, folks, you take your children in and you give them vaccines.
[00:48:48.772 --> 00:48:58.619]  When we have the documents, we have the admissions, we have it in triplicate, they are openly poisoning and brain damaging your children by design to reduce their IQ.
[00:49:00.381 --> 00:49:06.606]  Brave New World, as Aldous Huxley said before he died, that book was about official government plans that were to be implemented by 2000.
[00:49:07.086 --> 00:49:13.131]  And we're in Brave New World, and man, they got people so dumbed down they're not even worried that I'm on the air warning you.
[00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:16.430]  Another thing is status.
[00:49:16.450 --> 00:49:22.992]  There's a lot of people who know the world's evil and know what's happening, but they've made a selfish decision not to care.
[00:49:24.913 --> 00:49:30.335]  Somehow they've told themselves, they've tricked themselves, that if they only care about themselves, that they'll get ahead.
[00:49:32.195 --> 00:49:38.757]  And they've decided, since the public's dumb and things are bad, that, well, I'll just join the bad guys and I'll feed on these people.
[00:49:39.538 --> 00:49:40.878]  And I'll take care of myself.
[00:49:41.866 --> 00:49:46.029]  And I'll take care of my family by enslaving others under me.
[00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:50.213]  These people are so dumb, they don't deserve to be defended.
[00:49:51.093 --> 00:49:55.637]  And let me tell you, that is the lie that has brought down every major civilization.
[00:49:55.917 --> 00:49:57.738]  That's the lie that's going to bring you down.
[00:49:57.778 --> 00:50:01.261]  You think you're safe in a society where all you care about is yourself?
[00:50:01.862 --> 00:50:03.603]  You have toxified your environment.
[00:50:03.983 --> 00:50:06.185]  Now, none of your neighbors are going to care about you either.
[00:50:07.142 --> 00:50:09.502]  Now your daughter is not going to be able to find a good husband.
[00:50:10.003 --> 00:50:12.783]  Your son is not going to be able to find a good wife.
[00:50:13.483 --> 00:50:17.184]  You're not going to have the blessings of grandchildren, of good grandchildren.
[00:50:17.664 --> 00:50:21.344]  You're going to have all the wages of sin, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:21.585 --> 00:50:22.545]  And what is sin?
[00:50:22.845 --> 00:50:25.305]  It's when you break the rules of the universe.
[00:50:25.785 --> 00:50:28.786]  It's when you break the rules of the life force.
[00:50:29.186 --> 00:50:31.326]  It's when you go off the rails.
[00:50:32.806 --> 00:50:35.787]  You become accursed, and the wages of it are death.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:36.800]  Death!
[00:50:37.300 --> 00:50:37.681]  Death!
[00:50:38.601 --> 00:50:41.663]  And all those that hate God love death.
[00:50:42.143 --> 00:50:43.323]  And boy do they love death.
[00:50:43.343 --> 00:50:51.708]  If you look around us, we are becoming a vampiric, parasitic society.
[00:50:53.308 --> 00:50:54.889]  And we are rotten to the core.
[00:50:54.969 --> 00:50:56.650]  And somebody's got to tell you that.
[00:50:57.250 --> 00:50:58.611]  Somebody's got to talk about it.
[00:50:58.811 --> 00:51:00.392]  We'll come back, take calls, cover more news.
[00:51:01.613 --> 00:51:05.940]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.141 --> 00:51:10.488]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.466 --> 00:51:15.089]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.129 --> 00:51:18.192]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:51:18.252 --> 00:51:22.476]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.557 --> 00:51:29.484]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.604 --> 00:51:31.626]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.846 --> 00:51:42.412]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.592 --> 00:51:47.995]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:52:01.488 --> 00:52:03.109]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.249 --> 00:52:07.372]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.492 --> 00:52:10.373]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.453 --> 00:52:17.178]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.338 --> 00:52:20.359]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:22.941]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:23.081 --> 00:52:27.804]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:52:27.964 --> 00:52:42.552]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:52:42.693 --> 00:52:49.376]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-

[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:39.301]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:53:39.341 --> 00:53:41.142]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:09.554 --> 00:54:13.716]  Folks, I'm not trying to get down on sports alone.
[00:54:13.736 --> 00:54:18.758]  And I think athletics are great, especially for young people.
[00:54:18.778 --> 00:54:27.562]  But when it becomes an idol, a religion, when that's what you love most in life, when that's your self-worth, I'm feeling real good right now.
[00:54:27.582 --> 00:54:31.423]  The Spurs just won another championship.
[00:54:33.284 --> 00:54:35.565]  Meanwhile, you don't have any savings and you're in debt.
[00:54:36.571 --> 00:54:39.992]  And the government and the media just says, oh, forget about it.
[00:54:40.432 --> 00:54:42.012]  Get more into entertainment.
[00:54:42.032 --> 00:54:47.954]  You know, get lost and divert yourself, distract yourself.
[00:54:47.974 --> 00:54:52.795]  I actually hear ads on radio that are, you know, come into our bar, forget about all the problems.
[00:54:53.435 --> 00:54:57.296]  Problems only get worse when you deny they're there.
[00:54:58.136 --> 00:55:00.497]  And we're talking about life and death of the society now.
[00:55:03.163 --> 00:55:04.464]  That's why we're in this position.
[00:55:04.944 --> 00:55:09.666]  I know we've got Robert, Alex, John, Brad, Eric, Kevin, everybody.
[00:55:10.066 --> 00:55:11.187]  I'm going to get to all of you.
[00:55:11.247 --> 00:55:15.408]  It's just that this is important news and information that we've been talking about.
[00:55:17.229 --> 00:55:22.632]  Because we can talk about all the problems in the world, but why now are the politicians moving against us?
[00:55:23.072 --> 00:55:26.033]  Why now are they dismantling the whole Bill of Rights and Constitution?
[00:55:26.413 --> 00:55:27.994]  Why now are they so arrogant?
[00:55:29.992 --> 00:55:34.135]  Because they know they've dumbed down a certain percentage of the population beyond return.
[00:55:34.196 --> 00:55:41.882]  Just literally drooling idiots who never had a chance, whose whole lives are just self-centered messes.
[00:55:44.704 --> 00:55:49.208]  I mean, you're not truly alive, folks, until you feel like you're part of something greater.
[00:55:50.889 --> 00:55:53.812]  And then you can't be part of something greater that's a fraud.
[00:55:53.832 --> 00:55:57.855]  The New World Order are masters at giving you counterfeits in that.
[00:56:00.026 --> 00:56:00.766]  It's really simple.
[00:56:00.806 --> 00:56:02.347]  There's two different ways to look at the world.
[00:56:02.387 --> 00:56:20.917]  You can be self-centered and only care about yourself, and not even care that society is falling apart, or not even care that the New World Order is destroying everyone's culture by design, and that all these wonderful cultures that are thousands of years old are all ending, are all being destroyed right now.
[00:56:22.618 --> 00:56:23.799]  What we are, who we are,
[00:56:25.894 --> 00:56:30.337]  There is the crowd who cares about that and is upset about that.
[00:56:30.937 --> 00:56:32.058]  That's really a benchmark.
[00:56:33.719 --> 00:56:36.021]  And who worries about future generations.
[00:56:36.041 --> 00:56:38.162]  I mean, I worry about future generations.
[00:56:38.222 --> 00:56:48.969]  I have a palpable feeling of concern for my great-great-great-great-great-great unborn grandchildren, you know, who will probably be living out on
[00:56:50.502 --> 00:56:58.325]  Mars or out on some space station, I have more concern about them or as much as I do about my own family.
[00:56:59.385 --> 00:57:03.627]  I mean, you know if you could bounce those children on your knee that you'll never meet.
[00:57:05.587 --> 00:57:09.309]  You know that they'll have as much value to you as your own children.
[00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:12.710]  They say grandparents love their grandchildren even more than they love their own children.
[00:57:14.594 --> 00:57:16.735]  Again, it's that unbroken chain.
[00:57:17.155 --> 00:57:18.336]  It's that humanity.
[00:57:18.356 --> 00:57:25.378]  It's living forever through your children and through what you passed on to them and what they passed on to their children.
[00:57:26.019 --> 00:57:27.479]  That is everything.
[00:57:28.339 --> 00:57:31.761]  And it's all being stolen and all of that heritage.
[00:57:32.341 --> 00:57:37.923]  I don't care whether you're a Native American or you're black or you're white or you're Chinese.
[00:57:38.543 --> 00:57:40.244]  All of that is being replaced.
[00:57:40.928 --> 00:57:51.991]  With smirking airhead Hollywood starlets and Hollywood studs and sports and iPods and all of it.
[00:57:52.091 --> 00:57:54.351]  And I'm not even saying all that stuff's bad.
[00:57:54.411 --> 00:57:57.872]  Starlets and studs and football and all that.
[00:57:58.192 --> 00:58:09.575]  But if it's your God and if you've got your priorities screwed up and your house isn't in order and you're spending hundreds of dollars per football ticket or baseball ticket but your children...
[00:58:12.972 --> 00:58:13.792]  Your children.
[00:58:13.812 --> 00:58:20.275]  You know, you don't have them in piano lessons, or you don't have them in a rock climbing class, or you're not spending time with them.
[00:58:23.056 --> 00:58:24.396]  Get your priorities straight.
[00:58:24.556 --> 00:58:25.937]  Something is wrong with you.
[00:58:28.357 --> 00:58:31.899]  The New World Order knows that the key is destroying the family.
[00:58:32.719 --> 00:58:34.760]  And so that's why I've spent 45 minutes on it.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:38.441]  We have got to rescue the families.
[00:58:41.522 --> 00:58:45.452]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.773 --> 00:58:46.635]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.893 --> 00:58:58.534]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.194 --> 00:59:00.255]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.955 --> 00:59:01.976]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.737 --> 00:59:03.557]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.298 --> 00:59:05.819]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.879 --> 00:59:09.661]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.041 --> 00:59:14.204]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.344 --> 00:59:19.588]  All right, we're now in the second hour of this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:59:19.648 --> 00:59:20.829]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:22.990 --> 00:59:31.073]  The world government in scores of textbooks and public policy papers says the family is the enemy of one world government and the elite.
[00:59:31.833 --> 00:59:34.114]  The elite is obsessed with their ancestors.
[00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:36.595]  They are obsessed with family bloodlines.
[00:59:36.635 --> 00:59:39.416]  They are obsessed with handing down knowledge.
[00:59:40.237 --> 00:59:41.617]  And they even ritualize it.
[00:59:42.357 --> 00:59:46.899]  And then they're training you through the popular media to totally turn your back on it.
[00:59:47.899 --> 00:59:49.120]  They are systematically...
[00:59:50.712 --> 00:59:53.234]  Belittling and attacking all of our cultures.
[00:59:53.914 --> 00:59:58.336]  They're trying to meld us all into one disgusting Hollywood culture.
[01:00:00.358 --> 01:00:01.438]  And really, that's the key.
[01:00:01.558 --> 01:00:02.819]  That is the key to defeating them.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.082]  Is causing a reawakening, a new love of our cultures.
[01:00:08.582 --> 01:00:16.166]  And again, I don't care what color you are, but you should realize that multiculturalism is a target to destroy that culture.
[01:00:17.187 --> 01:00:18.648]  Destroy all of our cultures.
[01:00:19.815 --> 01:00:25.716]  And to attack anyone who wants to be self-sufficient and independent and who wants to be part of their heritage.
[01:00:26.257 --> 01:00:29.037]  Because our heritage is freedom and they can't stand it.
[01:00:30.498 --> 01:00:32.838]  Systematic enslavement is taking place.
[01:00:33.718 --> 01:00:36.399]  We are here to defend liberty and freedom and to tell the truth.
[01:00:37.259 --> 01:00:38.479]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:47.382]  Let's run through a gamut of calls until the next six or seven callers that are on the board have been exhausted and then we'll go back into news and take more of your calls.
[01:00:47.942 --> 01:00:49.282]  Robert in Colorado, go ahead.
[01:00:50.354 --> 01:00:51.234]  Good morning, Alexander.
[01:00:51.254 --> 01:00:52.095]  Thanks for taking my call.
[01:00:52.175 --> 01:00:56.476]  Once again, I get the dubious distinction of following one of your obscene yet spot-on soliloquies.
[01:00:56.496 --> 01:00:58.857]  You're giving me a security complex.
[01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:00.378]  Two quick points.
[01:01:00.438 --> 01:01:04.619]  That first one, I wasn't going to talk about it, but you touched on it, so I want to mention it.
[01:01:04.879 --> 01:01:05.860]  Avion Flu.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:09.721]  I was listening to George Murray a couple weeks ago one night, and he had a Ph.D.
[01:01:10.181 --> 01:01:12.582]  doctor scientist who had done a lot of research and
[01:01:13.328 --> 01:01:13.848]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:13.868 --> 01:01:17.889]  So you're better off worrying about being hit by a drunk driver than catching something from a bird.
[01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:18.510]  It just...
[01:01:32.139 --> 01:01:34.480]  Diseases don't jump from animals to humans normally.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.741]  Well, you can say what you want about George Norrie, but he's spot-on about peak oil, saying it's a fraud.
[01:01:39.761 --> 01:01:40.181]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:40.421 --> 01:01:44.142]  He's been spot-on saying the avian flu thing is a bunch of hype propaganda.
[01:01:44.582 --> 01:01:45.203]  That's what he said.
[01:01:45.943 --> 01:01:46.423]  Exactly.
[01:01:46.483 --> 01:01:47.083]  And you know what?
[01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:50.524]  I can't say that about a lot of other so-called patriot broadcasters.
[01:01:50.984 --> 01:01:53.965]  They have just been all over this thing, trying to profiteer off of it.
[01:01:54.425 --> 01:01:54.825]  Exactly.
[01:01:54.885 --> 01:01:56.806]  Not only that, the so-called...
[01:01:58.847 --> 01:02:06.410]  Well, again, one of the big stockholders in that is Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:02:06.430 --> 01:02:07.090]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:02:07.750 --> 01:02:08.111]  No problem.
[01:02:08.331 --> 01:02:19.635]  The other thing is, you talked about Julius Caesar a couple weeks ago, and you mentioned that he took over Rome, invaded it, also invaded the neighboring countries, Gaul and so forth, and
[01:02:20.231 --> 01:02:26.775]  I always grew up thinking that Caesar was one of the good guys, and the reason he was killed was because he wouldn't go along with the bankers, the power brokers in Rome.
[01:02:26.815 --> 01:02:29.497]  But listening to you, maybe that's not quite true.
[01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:30.277]  Was he a good guy?
[01:02:30.317 --> 01:02:30.997]  Was he a bad guy?
[01:02:31.017 --> 01:02:33.619]  And if he, in fact, was bad, why was he then killed?
[01:02:33.639 --> 01:02:36.701]  Put that into historical context for me, would you please?
[01:02:36.941 --> 01:02:42.824]  Well, I mean, understand, there are people who just do nothing but study Rome, and they don't know 10% of what happened there.
[01:02:42.864 --> 01:02:43.805]  I mean, it's a huge...
[01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:58.877]  Several hundred years from the dawn of Rome with Romulus and Remus and the She-Wolf right up until, you know, the twin emperors and Rome divided into two and Alaric the Great sacking Rome and was it 410?
[01:02:59.797 --> 01:03:01.999]  So, I mean, or Odisser.
[01:03:02.459 --> 01:03:04.820]  I mean, how do you even try to cover it all?
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:12.525]  I wouldn't know, but certainly there was a pack of crooks and people and controllers and schemers and
[01:03:13.467 --> 01:03:15.928]  There were also people like Cato in there.
[01:03:16.428 --> 01:03:18.909]  They ran the gamut.
[01:03:19.289 --> 01:03:21.911]  And of course, you two brutish, stabbing him to death there.
[01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:24.292]  All of them taking turns stabbing Caesar.
[01:03:26.132 --> 01:03:27.173]  Thanks for the call, Robert.
[01:03:27.193 --> 01:03:33.095]  Let me just briefly give you my opinion on this, because really, with something like this, it really is my opinion.
[01:03:33.115 --> 01:03:38.518]  I mean, I know more about Rome than most people, but that isn't saying much.
[01:03:39.278 --> 01:03:40.258]  It is voluminous.
[01:03:40.318 --> 01:03:41.419]  It is encyclopedic.
[01:03:41.519 --> 01:03:41.779]  It is...
[01:03:43.530 --> 01:03:47.432]  It's impossible to know everything about Rome and its history, but I know a little bit.
[01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:48.133]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:48.213 --> 01:03:52.876]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.617 --> 01:03:57.479]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.739 --> 01:03:58.419]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.519 --> 01:03:59.300]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.660 --> 01:04:04.343]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.683 --> 01:04:11.387]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.727 --> 01:04:13.709]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.909 --> 01:04:16.752]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:21.496]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.696 --> 01:04:26.120]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:33.587]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.847 --> 01:04:36.269]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:55.316 --> 01:04:56.356]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.677 --> 01:04:59.458]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.738 --> 01:05:03.879]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.140]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:10.022]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.522 --> 01:05:12.644]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.125 --> 01:05:27.838]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.878 --> 01:05:34.945]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:16.060]  We're good to go.
[01:06:30.316 --> 01:06:30.636]  Or call 1-866-884-9104.
[01:06:30.656 --> 01:06:30.856]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[01:06:54.315 --> 01:06:56.517]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.537 --> 01:06:59.939]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:04.223 --> 01:07:12.289]  Our last caller in Colorado asked the question, was Julius Caesar a good guy or a bad guy?
[01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:20.275]  Well, clearly, his takeover of Rome, his setting himself up as a dictator...
[01:07:21.087 --> 01:07:25.769]  Marks the beginning of the long slide or decline of Rome.
[01:07:27.390 --> 01:07:38.576]  The corrupt elites outsourcing the production out of Rome, bringing in more slaves, freeing those slaves, having a large immigrant population.
[01:07:41.817 --> 01:07:49.561]  Taxing and regulating and more and more obsessions with sports and gladiatorial diversions and events.
[01:07:52.774 --> 01:08:03.296]  I mean, there have literally been hundreds of historians and sociologists and psychologists comparing modern America and the Western world to Rome.
[01:08:03.436 --> 01:08:06.997]  And I mean, it is a mirror image in so many respects.
[01:08:07.077 --> 01:08:15.099]  But the reason I'm talking about Julius Caesar is, when you hear the term, he crossed the Rubicon, that means, man, it's the point of no return.
[01:08:15.559 --> 01:08:21.180]  Man, you know, when a crook walks in to rob a grocery store and he pulls the gun out,
[01:08:22.285 --> 01:08:27.446]  The police detectives will call that crossing the Rubicon, or the point of no return.
[01:08:28.387 --> 01:08:31.668]  It was illegal to bring your legions into Rome.
[01:08:33.928 --> 01:08:44.751]  You would have several top individuals who had kind of executive power, there would be two of them, instead of having one president in the Senate.
[01:08:45.811 --> 01:08:48.552]  And both of them couldn't be in Rome at the same time.
[01:08:49.514 --> 01:09:00.061]  And so Caesar was outside Rome, and then they staged a riot and staged an attack on one of the other, what was the term, regents.
[01:09:02.983 --> 01:09:04.243]  I hate it when my memory fails me.
[01:09:04.263 --> 01:09:04.984]  That's not the term.
[01:09:05.024 --> 01:09:06.165]  Was it regent?
[01:09:06.545 --> 01:09:07.706]  It'll pop my head in a second.
[01:09:08.486 --> 01:09:10.848]  And so then he said, that's it, I'm going to bring my troops in.
[01:09:12.729 --> 01:09:16.091]  And he crossed the river in the north known as the Rubicon.
[01:09:17.106 --> 01:09:24.149]  Out of Austria into Italy itself, and he came into Rome, and he took over.
[01:09:25.650 --> 01:09:34.214]  And it's interesting to note that Julius Caesar's family had made their money controlling the firefighter guilds.
[01:09:35.615 --> 01:09:40.377]  And the firefighter union didn't just put out fires.
[01:09:40.477 --> 01:09:42.058]  If you didn't pay them protection...
[01:09:42.737 --> 01:09:48.502]  They'd come by with a big bucket of oil at night and throw it on your house and burn your house down.
[01:09:50.744 --> 01:09:55.789]  By the way, the Italian mafia, La Cosa Nostra, says that they model everything they do off the old Roman system.
[01:09:55.809 --> 01:10:09.001]  So when they come to your grocery store and say, or they come to your shop, your textiles factory, and they say, or to your clothier, and they say,
[01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:21.812]  Pay us 10% of your gross and hire my second cousin and pay him X amount of money or we're going to burn down your business.
[01:10:23.332 --> 01:10:29.653]  Well, that was started 100 years before Julius Caesar ever showed up on the scene.
[01:10:29.693 --> 01:10:38.475]  In very early, first days of Rome, fire departments would burn your place down if you didn't pay them.
[01:10:41.162 --> 01:10:43.623]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:10:43.663 --> 01:10:47.324]  So, the more things change, the more they stay the same.
[01:10:47.484 --> 01:10:49.004]  Governments carrying out terrorism.
[01:10:50.484 --> 01:10:53.605]  Now, obviously, fire departments today don't do that.
[01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:55.025]  They are pure public servants.
[01:10:55.545 --> 01:10:58.766]  One of the few areas in government where we actually see public servants at work.
[01:10:59.166 --> 01:11:00.307]  I love firefighters.
[01:11:00.327 --> 01:11:01.627]  I have nothing but respect for them.
[01:11:02.127 --> 01:11:03.867]  They are what the police used to be.
[01:11:04.767 --> 01:11:06.828]  Respected, admirable people.
[01:11:07.628 --> 01:11:20.755]  But to be held in high esteem as true servants, not officials or authorities, like the police calling us civilians.
[01:11:21.195 --> 01:11:26.177]  And again, they're still good police, but the system itself is now corrupt, so it must be exposed.
[01:11:26.898 --> 01:11:37.403]  But there, now I've babbled on about Julius Caesar, and Congressman Ron Paul and former high-level CIA analyst Ray McGovern said the same things on this broadcast.
[01:11:39.238 --> 01:11:41.441]  The globalists are gearing up for martial law.
[01:11:41.501 --> 01:11:42.323]  Will they implement?
[01:11:42.383 --> 01:11:42.923]  We don't know.
[01:11:43.504 --> 01:11:54.400]  They are slowly setting it up, putting it into place, and now it's starting to accelerate in the preparations and the pace of it being erected.
[01:11:56.858 --> 01:12:10.345]  And clearly, if there's another terror attack, Ron Paul has said this, Ray McGovern said this, every guest we have on now who's got expertise in this is saying, but clearly, if there's more terror attacks, the government's got to be suspect in it.
[01:12:10.365 --> 01:12:22.651]  I mean, we had George Galloway, big influential member of the British Parliament on, whether it's a Republican Ron Paul or a Republican like Ray McGovern, chief analyst for Ronald Reagan and Bush Sr.,
[01:12:23.684 --> 01:12:31.888]  Or whether it is a liberal like George Galloway or a high-level member of Parliament, Michael Meacher.
[01:12:32.028 --> 01:12:34.409]  They say the same thing that we say.
[01:12:35.949 --> 01:12:41.992]  Not because we all get together or read each other's columns or have pre-interviews.
[01:12:42.052 --> 01:12:42.412]  We don't.
[01:12:42.532 --> 01:12:44.013]  I call up and go, I want George Galloway on.
[01:12:44.073 --> 01:12:44.433]  Okay.
[01:12:44.753 --> 01:12:46.954]  He comes on, totally agrees with me word for word.
[01:12:47.334 --> 01:12:49.075]  Have Ron Paul on, totally agrees.
[01:12:49.727 --> 01:12:51.068]  Can have Colonel Craig Roberts on.
[01:12:51.128 --> 01:12:51.869]  Totally agrees.
[01:12:52.089 --> 01:12:53.450]  Can have Paul Craig Roberts on.
[01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:54.651]  Totally agrees.
[01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:57.913]  Can have Mr. Reynolds on.
[01:12:57.953 --> 01:12:58.674]  Totally agrees.
[01:13:00.555 --> 01:13:03.938]  Because the facts are the facts are the facts.
[01:13:03.978 --> 01:13:10.303]  It's like if I'm walking down the beach and I see a dead sperm whale and I walk up and five other people walk up and they go, that's a dead sperm whale.
[01:13:10.823 --> 01:13:14.346]  It's not all that we got in the back room and decided to say it was a sperm whale dead on the beach.
[01:13:14.646 --> 01:13:16.148]  We know what a sperm whale looks like.
[01:13:16.188 --> 01:13:17.869]  We know a dead sperm whale when we see one.
[01:13:19.668 --> 01:13:25.531]  I mean, folks, it's not... It's like holding up five fingers and going, how many fingers am I holding up?
[01:13:25.631 --> 01:13:26.111]  Five!
[01:13:26.992 --> 01:13:28.773]  It's like saying, what's two plus two equal?
[01:13:28.813 --> 01:13:29.873]  Okay, it equals four.
[01:13:30.754 --> 01:13:32.475]  I'll never get to your calls if I don't shut up.
[01:13:32.495 --> 01:13:37.858]  But it's just... I like to run on at the mouth, and obviously you guys don't mind it too much.
[01:13:38.098 --> 01:13:41.479]  Most highly listened to Patriot Radio show in the country, but I still need to shut up.
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:43.441]  Alex and Mass, you're on the air.
[01:13:43.481 --> 01:13:43.941]  Go ahead.
[01:13:44.061 --> 01:13:44.861]  Yeah, what up, Alex?
[01:13:44.881 --> 01:13:46.442]  I don't have anything too much important.
[01:13:46.522 --> 01:13:47.883]  I just have a few questions, um,
[01:13:48.652 --> 01:14:00.776]  Are there any, like, simple plans or anything written out, like, some good documents, like, some top ten, like, ways to convince people, like, to get unbrainwashed about the government and all, like, you know, the brainwashing that's been happening?
[01:14:01.056 --> 01:14:07.519]  And also, would you consider ever going on one of the other, like, top entertainment radio morning shows, which would be Howard Stern?
[01:14:07.539 --> 01:14:08.939]  You'd get some real exposure.
[01:14:09.399 --> 01:14:10.240]  You'd be in New York.
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:16.842]  No, I've been contacted by Howard Stern's producer who told me I was going to be on and then never had me on.
[01:14:17.555 --> 01:14:19.736]  Oh, I'd say keep on with that.
[01:14:19.776 --> 01:14:21.076]  That would be great.
[01:14:21.116 --> 01:14:22.457]  Well, I don't have time to pursue it.
[01:14:22.497 --> 01:14:27.278]  In fact, lately I've cut back on the number of interviews I can do just because I've got to talk the talk.
[01:14:27.298 --> 01:14:29.499]  I've got to walk the walk and spend more time with my family.
[01:14:30.559 --> 01:14:33.280]  But, I mean, that comes first even if I don't get as much work done.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.582]  But, no, I mean, if Howard Stern wants to have me on, I'd do it.
[01:14:38.522 --> 01:14:38.702]  Right.
[01:14:38.762 --> 01:14:41.763]  Also, you don't know anyone who has any publications that, like,
[01:14:42.392 --> 01:14:58.156]  Like, real simple instructions, like, just on how to get people, like, to realize that things aren't going the way they want them to be if they want, like, the Earth to not be a prison planet.
[01:15:00.336 --> 01:15:00.797]  I hear you.
[01:15:00.817 --> 01:15:01.677]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:01.737 --> 01:15:05.638]  LibertyStickers.com, a sponsor, has a really good sticker.
[01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:09.019]  I might expropriate it and make a T-shirt out of it if they'll let me.
[01:15:09.979 --> 01:15:10.579]  Evil Men...
[01:15:11.673 --> 01:15:13.674]  Are in control, haven't you noticed?
[01:15:14.315 --> 01:15:15.916]  I think I've even said that before.
[01:15:15.956 --> 01:15:22.480]  The point is that it's very, very, very simple.
[01:15:24.621 --> 01:15:25.642]  It's very simple.
[01:15:28.323 --> 01:15:34.527]  Look, a lot of people say you've got to give people baby steps, you've got to slowly feed them, you've got to slowly wake them up.
[01:15:36.224 --> 01:15:37.945]  And that is how most people woke up.
[01:15:38.245 --> 01:15:49.228]  But what happened is most people heard Alex Jones or Tex Mars or somebody else on the radio 10 years ago, 15 years ago, 20 years ago, and they laughed at us.
[01:15:49.668 --> 01:15:50.568]  But they've got memories.
[01:15:50.688 --> 01:15:51.429]  They're not stupid.
[01:15:51.449 --> 01:15:52.249]  They're just in denial.
[01:15:53.489 --> 01:15:56.230]  And then slowly over time, they've seen it all come true.
[01:15:56.290 --> 01:16:02.772]  I mean, listen, did you know that we still run AXS TV shows that we did nine years ago?
[01:16:04.321 --> 01:16:07.662]  People always email me and say, why do you keep nine-year-old shows running?
[01:16:08.583 --> 01:16:13.865]  Because I'll sit there and watch a nine-year-old show, and you talk about having a little bit of pride.
[01:16:13.945 --> 01:16:16.726]  I'm actually kind of sad, though, that we haven't stopped it.
[01:16:17.187 --> 01:16:19.448]  Everything I say has happened.
[01:16:19.568 --> 01:16:20.988]  It's unbelievable.
[01:16:23.109 --> 01:16:25.210]  Because the globalists are actually carrying this plan out.
[01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:27.691]  I mean, I remember reading their plans a decade ago.
[01:16:27.731 --> 01:16:29.752]  I couldn't believe it myself, but it's all happened.
[01:16:31.554 --> 01:16:51.608]  So really, the power, one of the biggest things we've got in our arsenal, kind of our 105 mile an hour dipping speedball in our repertoire of tricks, is that we have the power of prediction.
[01:16:51.648 --> 01:16:52.909]  We're telling the truth.
[01:16:52.989 --> 01:16:53.930]  We know what's happening.
[01:16:55.214 --> 01:17:04.699]  So whereas the Republicans and Democrats contradict themselves every five minutes and are constantly lying and constantly, quote, getting it wrong on purpose, on the basics, we're dead on.
[01:17:05.059 --> 01:17:06.140]  We're with the founding fathers.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:06.980]  We're with common sense.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:07.701]  We're with history.
[01:17:08.021 --> 01:17:09.742]  We have their own manuals, their own documents.
[01:17:10.182 --> 01:17:11.262]  We know what their plan is.
[01:17:11.422 --> 01:17:20.087]  One world government, total enslavement of you and your family, forced drugging, poisons introduced into your food supply so that you die at a young age.
[01:17:21.238 --> 01:17:32.088]  Right around the time you retire, it's designed to reduce, because we would be living to be 120 right now because of increased nutrition, so they've got to introduce poisons to make sure we keep dying at 75.
[01:17:35.871 --> 01:17:37.292]  People are going to laugh at us at first.
[01:17:37.312 --> 01:17:38.253]  They're not going to laugh later.
[01:17:38.573 --> 01:17:40.275]  And frankly, in the past, they laughed at me.
[01:17:41.636 --> 01:17:46.200]  They don't laugh anymore because everybody deep down knows something's wrong.
[01:17:48.394 --> 01:17:51.957]  Now, I know a lot of people call in, they go, everybody I've talked to is waking up.
[01:17:51.977 --> 01:17:55.180]  But if you listen to them, they sound forceful, they sound focused, they sound educated.
[01:17:56.701 --> 01:17:57.201]  Informed.
[01:17:58.943 --> 01:18:01.004]  Other people call in, they go, nobody listens to me.
[01:18:01.024 --> 01:18:02.105]  And I go, well, who are you talking to?
[01:18:02.145 --> 01:18:02.706]  My family.
[01:18:03.627 --> 01:18:05.989]  Well, number one, your family thinks you're putting them down.
[01:18:06.369 --> 01:18:08.310]  Your family thinks you're trying to impress them.
[01:18:08.651 --> 01:18:11.373]  Look, we've got one that knows how to read.
[01:18:11.393 --> 01:18:12.434]  You know, it's kind of like that.
[01:18:13.681 --> 01:18:14.641]  Listen to Billy.
[01:18:14.681 --> 01:18:16.802]  He's talking about stuff being corrupt.
[01:18:16.842 --> 01:18:18.863]  He's trying to act all smarty pants.
[01:18:19.623 --> 01:18:21.404]  Do not waste your time with your family.
[01:18:23.885 --> 01:18:24.345]  I mean, really.
[01:18:24.385 --> 01:18:26.266]  They see it as you're trying to show off to them.
[01:18:26.286 --> 01:18:29.507]  Just... Don't waste your time.
[01:18:29.827 --> 01:18:30.348]  I mean, really.
[01:18:31.388 --> 01:18:35.209]  Look, if people don't act like they appreciate what they're hearing, I just don't bother.
[01:18:36.030 --> 01:18:36.550]  Hey, good.
[01:18:37.090 --> 01:18:38.051]  Die in your ignorance.
[01:18:38.551 --> 01:18:40.431]  Like Christ said, let the dead bury the dead.
[01:18:41.512 --> 01:18:41.672]  Just...
[01:18:43.652 --> 01:18:44.534]  We're going to run to Caesar.
[01:18:44.574 --> 01:18:45.176]  What's Caesar?
[01:18:45.256 --> 01:18:46.499]  You want to worship Caesar?
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:48.022]  Just go ahead and be part of it.
[01:18:48.062 --> 01:18:49.486]  I'm not going to be part of it.
[01:18:55.063 --> 01:18:56.664]  Government is best which governs least.
[01:18:57.224 --> 01:18:58.525]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:18:58.965 --> 01:19:01.686]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:19:02.106 --> 01:19:04.767]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:11.670]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:19.374]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at libertystickers.com.
[01:19:19.994 --> 01:19:21.415]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:19:21.455 --> 01:19:21.655]  Have you?
[01:19:21.695 --> 01:19:22.736]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:19:22.756 --> 01:19:24.618]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:19:45.202 --> 01:19:46.284]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:19:46.826 --> 01:19:48.008]  Osama Bin-Forgotten.

[01:19:53.925 --> 01:19:55.507]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:19:55.907 --> 01:20:01.633]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:20:01.893 --> 01:20:07.039]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:20:07.379 --> 01:20:16.649]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:20:17.009 --> 01:20:21.950]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:26.271]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:20:26.491 --> 01:20:31.252]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:20:31.613 --> 01:20:37.534]  The Berkey Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:20:37.874 --> 01:20:42.655]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:20:42.695 --> 01:20:43.316]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:43.356 --> 01:20:44.956]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:44.996 --> 01:20:45.896]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:45.936 --> 01:20:46.416]  One and the same.
[01:21:03.641 --> 01:21:07.623]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:07.643 --> 01:21:09.704]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:09.724 --> 01:21:10.224]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:10.264 --> 01:21:11.765]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:12.045 --> 01:21:12.525]  Here is reality.
[01:21:12.545 --> 01:21:14.566]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:29.386 --> 01:21:29.686]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:56.463 --> 01:21:57.964]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[01:21:58.144 --> 01:22:02.065]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[01:22:02.345 --> 01:22:09.668]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste fill, is something we all face, every day.
[01:22:09.948 --> 01:22:11.848]  That's why no family should be without the NucAlert.
[01:22:12.168 --> 01:22:18.931]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the NucAlert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long life battery lasts for 10 years.
[01:22:19.271 --> 01:22:22.172]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy tested.
[01:22:22.412 --> 01:22:25.073]  Your NucAlert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area,
[01:22:25.393 --> 01:22:29.515]  Or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation, call 877-817-9829.
[01:22:30.336 --> 01:22:35.058]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nuke Alert today.
[01:22:35.358 --> 01:22:38.560]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:43.422]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[01:22:43.702 --> 01:22:43.922]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:22:43.943 --> 01:22:45.363]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nuke Alert today.
[01:22:45.383 --> 01:22:45.663]  Nuke Alert.
[01:22:45.723 --> 01:22:46.904]  Isn't your family worth it?
[01:22:57.097 --> 01:23:02.819]  All right, I've got to blast your calls a little bit quicker here, because we do need to get in the news on the bird flu and so much more.
[01:23:04.359 --> 01:23:11.521]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to John in Boston, then Kevin, Brad, Eric, Joe, Rodney, so many others.
[01:23:11.781 --> 01:23:13.221]  Go ahead, Joe, or John.
[01:23:13.241 --> 01:23:14.842]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:23:15.102 --> 01:23:15.502]  Pretty good.
[01:23:16.142 --> 01:23:16.362]  Good.
[01:23:16.682 --> 01:23:22.064]  I called in, I believe it was last week, I told you about Governor Romney here in Massachusetts.
[01:23:22.244 --> 01:23:23.304]  Horrible creature, yes.
[01:23:24.284 --> 01:23:35.496]  Yeah, well, he announced it was on the news last week that he has proposed a plan to turn all the dorms at all the universities and colleges in Boston into...
[01:23:37.165 --> 01:23:41.846]  Pretty much like holding cells in case a bird flu epidemic breaks out here in Boston.
[01:23:42.246 --> 01:23:46.107]  Yeah, well, that's what America's all about now, is talking about camps and mass arrests.
[01:23:46.167 --> 01:23:51.168]  And 48 governors said, we don't want martial law, we don't want a federal dictatorship.
[01:23:51.228 --> 01:23:52.249]  That's what's been announced.
[01:23:52.269 --> 01:23:55.530]  But good old Romney, he's one of them that loves it.
[01:23:56.430 --> 01:23:57.110]  He certainly is.
[01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:58.870]  And I just, you know, keep an eye on him.
[01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:00.471]  I mean, we all are, but, you know.
[01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:02.211]  But you know they're all just puppets.
[01:24:02.231 --> 01:24:05.152]  You know, we get focused so much on Bush and so much on Romney.
[01:24:05.845 --> 01:24:07.426]  I mean, they're just little nobodies.
[01:24:08.286 --> 01:24:08.846]  They really are.
[01:24:08.946 --> 01:24:12.528]  And I just wanted to say, that was a great rant you had earlier in the program.
[01:24:12.648 --> 01:24:19.931]  And, you know, I have a son, and my favorite thing to do is take my son over to my grandparents' house and just listen to them talk.
[01:24:20.171 --> 01:24:23.473]  Because, you know, people don't realize how important their family really is.
[01:24:24.213 --> 01:24:26.274]  They take a Sunday out, they're watching football.
[01:24:26.714 --> 01:24:27.355]  No one's around.
[01:24:27.395 --> 01:24:28.595]  Go out and play with your kids.
[01:24:29.336 --> 01:24:30.156]  The best thing in the world.
[01:24:31.505 --> 01:24:32.846]  Listen, it disgusts me.
[01:24:33.386 --> 01:24:38.229]  I'll walk the dog at like 8 o'clock at night and all the houses are glowing with their TVs on.
[01:24:39.090 --> 01:24:42.912]  You can even look through the windows and see the kids playing video games right next to the TV.
[01:24:43.172 --> 01:24:44.413]  We're not communicating.
[01:24:44.453 --> 01:24:45.273]  We're dying.
[01:24:45.714 --> 01:24:49.796]  And this is only going to get worse and worse as we get hooked into technology and it becomes our god.
[01:24:49.816 --> 01:24:56.040]  I mean, I'm not saying you shouldn't watch a little TV or shouldn't be on the computer or shouldn't, but I mean, just don't make it your priority.
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:56.720]  Thanks for the call.
[01:24:57.341 --> 01:24:59.362]  We've got to get our priorities straight.
[01:25:01.003 --> 01:25:07.028]  And again, people don't have self-worth because of how they're doing in business or how they do with their family.
[01:25:07.088 --> 01:25:08.949]  It's all how the baseball team did.
[01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:15.635]  I mean, boy, look at the Astros.
[01:25:15.675 --> 01:25:17.577]  They're going to beat the Cardinals.
[01:25:17.877 --> 01:25:19.318]  Oh, man.
[01:25:21.901 --> 01:25:27.085]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kevin in Texas and Brad, Eric, and others.
[01:25:27.465 --> 01:25:28.086]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:25:30.475 --> 01:25:30.775]  Hey, Alex.
[01:25:30.795 --> 01:25:31.435]  How are you doing today?
[01:25:31.636 --> 01:25:31.896]  Fine.
[01:25:32.716 --> 01:25:33.576]  You're in rare form.
[01:25:33.736 --> 01:25:42.440]  I initially called up to talk about the land confiscation issue, but you just brought me off into so many other topics and my mind is just spinning.
[01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:50.384]  I was thinking about my grandparents and my distant cousins, my older cousins and great uncles and stuff.
[01:25:51.264 --> 01:25:57.787]  Through all my problems with Alcoa, the city of San Antonio, water districts, I'd always tell them, you really timed this well.
[01:25:57.807 --> 01:25:58.367]  You waited
[01:25:59.156 --> 01:26:04.539]  You waited until those people were gone to make this move because you never would have got away with it.
[01:26:04.799 --> 01:26:07.220]  I can think of all my relatives being volunteer firemen.
[01:26:07.260 --> 01:26:15.425]  I can think of one of my cousins a few years ago and they named a substation county building in one of the little towns after this crook.
[01:26:16.205 --> 01:26:25.830]  He drove up there with his pickup truck, got a bucket of paint out and a roller and a pole and duct taped a couple poles together and got out there and painted the guy's name off the sign right in front of the sheriff.
[01:26:27.597 --> 01:26:38.646]  I can remember my uncle breaking the nose of a sheriff's deputy from another county nearby that came onto his property and called him a crook and poked him on the chest with his finger and he one punch dropped him.
[01:26:39.647 --> 01:26:46.513]  This was just a couple of years ago and the sheriff of another county came and apologized and drugged the deputy out of there.
[01:26:47.274 --> 01:26:49.636]  Grandparents were so important, Alex.
[01:26:49.816 --> 01:26:52.058]  My mother was raised by her grandmother basically.
[01:26:52.728 --> 01:27:08.695]  Well, you know, while the father or the parents were out hunting wildebeest or castrating bull calves or dehorning, you were left to be raised by your grandparents basically and get their value system from another generation older.
[01:27:10.416 --> 01:27:21.481]  I can remember my relatives going to church on Sunday and there was usually an all-you-can-eat catfish place nearby and all the neighbors would go or go to someone's house.
[01:27:23.027 --> 01:27:23.487]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:27:46.963 --> 01:27:49.765]  Well, I was just pointing out that we've got our priorities all screwed up.
[01:27:49.805 --> 01:27:51.606]  I mean, there's a reason our kids are on drugs.
[01:27:51.626 --> 01:27:54.128]  There's a reason our society's falling apart.
[01:27:54.148 --> 01:27:59.331]  I mean, I see the young people, even middle-class kids, and they're turning them into animals.
[01:28:00.271 --> 01:28:01.933]  And that's their design, Kevin.
[01:28:01.973 --> 01:28:04.074]  I mean, we have their own manuals on this.
[01:28:04.854 --> 01:28:09.978]  And I don't know why we would let this alien government do this to us, but thanks for the call.
[01:28:10.558 --> 01:28:13.580]  And that's why I went into that 45-minute diatribe on it, because...
[01:28:14.935 --> 01:28:18.436]  The New World Order cannot stand if we have strong families.
[01:28:18.776 --> 01:28:23.518]  And that's why they're trying to say the schools have more authority over your children than you do.
[01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:29.480]  That's why they're trying to make kids go to school at 3 and, you know, stay in school until 6 at night.
[01:28:30.040 --> 01:28:31.761]  They want control of them.
[01:28:32.421 --> 01:28:34.762]  And then when you get home, the TV's got control of them.
[01:28:35.502 --> 01:28:36.542]  It's a crisis.
[01:28:37.302 --> 01:28:40.223]  It's an enemy psychological warfare attack.
[01:28:40.703 --> 01:28:42.044]  And knowing is half the battle.
[01:28:44.113 --> 01:28:45.015]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.517 --> 01:28:47.120]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.042 --> 01:28:50.728]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:57.090]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:28:57.330 --> 01:28:57.670]  Why?
[01:28:57.690 --> 01:29:00.610]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:29:00.710 --> 01:29:05.651]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:29:05.771 --> 01:29:15.473]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.
[01:29:15.653 --> 01:29:23.094]  Right now, as a special for GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping, a 30% savings off the regular price.
[01:29:23.254 --> 01:29:23.834]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.909 --> 01:29:54.810]  We're good to go.
[01:29:54.850 --> 01:29:55.530]  We're good to go.
[01:30:14.804 --> 01:30:15.384]  We're good to go.
[01:30:15.404 --> 01:30:16.025]  We're good to go.
[01:30:16.045 --> 01:30:16.705]  We're good to go.
[01:30:16.745 --> 01:30:17.306]  We're good to go.
[01:30:44.726 --> 01:30:45.327]  803-4438.
[01:30:46.888 --> 01:30:48.450]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:30:48.670 --> 01:30:49.011]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.362 --> 01:30:56.284]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[01:30:56.424 --> 01:30:58.665]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[01:30:59.005 --> 01:31:01.006]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[01:31:01.166 --> 01:31:03.627]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[01:31:03.707 --> 01:31:06.729]  But where oxygen is deficient, disease will thrive.
[01:31:06.909 --> 01:31:08.130]  Are you getting enough oxygen?
[01:31:08.350 --> 01:31:13.793]  If you spend much time indoors or live in an urban area, you're probably oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[01:31:13.853 --> 01:31:18.455]  This makes you vulnerable to all types of chronic disease as well as undue emotional stress.
[01:31:18.775 --> 01:31:24.958]  Clearly, increasing your body's oxygen level without negative side effects is critical to attaining good health and a sense of well-being.
[01:31:25.178 --> 01:31:31.122]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and all health-minded individuals.
[01:31:31.422 --> 01:31:37.165]  The Unmedical Miracle Oxygen is a book that will show you safe, easy ways to increase your body's oxygen level.

[01:31:45.789 --> 01:31:54.676]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:31:54.736 --> 01:32:02.101]  We're here live, folks.
[01:32:03.442 --> 01:32:05.123]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:32:13.587 --> 01:32:18.109]  I'm about to take a few more calls and then we're going to get back into the news.
[01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:19.809]  And believe me, there's a lot of it.
[01:32:20.970 --> 01:32:23.331]  I mean, this is how desensitized even I've gotten.
[01:32:24.291 --> 01:32:28.533]  I had two articles yesterday where cameras in the U.S.
[01:32:30.433 --> 01:32:36.036]  are going to have computer screens on them that make human faces that shout orders at you.
[01:32:38.256 --> 01:32:39.537]  And I first saw this
[01:32:40.925 --> 01:32:50.314]  Well, about four years ago in the BBC, they put in telescreens that shout orders at you and that have a mean face on them.
[01:32:51.215 --> 01:32:52.356]  They're on the plasma screen.
[01:32:53.577 --> 01:32:55.399]  Well, that's the new thing here in the U.S.
[01:32:55.419 --> 01:32:56.680]  So we're walking along and...
[01:32:57.410 --> 01:33:09.593]  The AI computer sees you drop a piece of paper, or one blows past you and it thinks you did it, and the camera will then announce, you have been biometrically scanned, you will be ticketed if you do not pick that up.
[01:33:09.653 --> 01:33:10.653]  Do it right now!
[01:33:11.933 --> 01:33:16.414]  I mean, they are actually using 1984 as a template.
[01:33:18.735 --> 01:33:20.495]  I mean, I can't believe how fast they're moving.
[01:33:20.895 --> 01:33:23.156]  So now they're going to be shouting at us.
[01:33:24.853 --> 01:33:31.217]  The good news is a lot of the cop unions are trying to stop all this because they know they're going to lose their jobs.
[01:33:31.237 --> 01:33:32.098]  A lot of them are.
[01:33:33.339 --> 01:33:38.402]  Because of the red light cameras and the surveillance cameras and the RFID tracker chips and the inspection stickers.
[01:33:38.783 --> 01:33:40.284]  It's all going to be automated.
[01:33:42.245 --> 01:33:45.828]  As early as next year, we were going to have it in Texas until we beat the bill.
[01:33:45.868 --> 01:33:47.389]  And I know I mention that every other day.
[01:33:47.409 --> 01:33:50.711]  It's just, I can't get over how close we are to this happening.
[01:33:52.276 --> 01:33:54.036]  They meant to have it all in place by 06.
[01:33:54.617 --> 01:33:55.857]  They're a couple years behind.
[01:33:56.277 --> 01:33:58.497]  Now it's 08, they're saying, is their target date.
[01:33:59.578 --> 01:34:02.458]  And I just beg the police, the government, anybody.
[01:34:02.478 --> 01:34:04.099]  I know most of you are on our side.
[01:34:05.439 --> 01:34:14.381]  I can't tell you how many people in the government, how many CIA, how many FBI, how many high-level border patrol, how many people in the State Department are on our sides.
[01:34:14.861 --> 01:34:17.141]  It would blow your mind if you knew.
[01:34:17.622 --> 01:34:19.342]  Just the people I'm in contact with.
[01:34:21.883 --> 01:34:35.005]  You know, the calls I get from colonels and generals, and it's kind of a James Bond type of life, but really I'm just some good old boy down in Texas who they know will get the word out.
[01:34:38.246 --> 01:34:40.746]  So it's kind of like Beverly Hillbillies meets James Bond.
[01:34:41.086 --> 01:34:42.887]  The point is, is we're not putting up with it.
[01:34:43.827 --> 01:34:45.587]  They think they're taking America down.
[01:34:45.647 --> 01:34:47.327]  We're not going quietly into the night.
[01:34:47.627 --> 01:34:48.708]  We're not giving up.
[01:34:49.228 --> 01:34:50.428]  This is the resistance.
[01:34:51.067 --> 01:34:53.008]  Now, I'm going to go through your calls very quickly now.
[01:34:53.268 --> 01:34:54.369]  Brad in Texas, go ahead.
[01:34:55.369 --> 01:34:55.949]  Hi there, Alex.
[01:34:56.009 --> 01:34:56.410]  Good day.
[01:34:56.450 --> 01:34:56.930]  Can you hear me?
[01:34:57.010 --> 01:34:57.370]  Yes, sir.
[01:34:57.930 --> 01:34:58.451]  Great, thanks.
[01:34:58.571 --> 01:34:59.811]  I have four things for you.
[01:34:59.851 --> 01:35:01.932]  Two articles regarding surveillance technology.
[01:35:02.152 --> 01:35:03.553]  I've got a question and a commentary.
[01:35:03.573 --> 01:35:03.993]  Are you ready?
[01:35:04.393 --> 01:35:04.694]  Yes, sir.
[01:35:05.394 --> 01:35:05.734]  Okay.
[01:35:06.294 --> 01:35:07.795]  I can read these articles or summarize them.
[01:35:07.815 --> 01:35:08.275]  Your choice.
[01:35:08.515 --> 01:35:09.136]  Summarize them.
[01:35:09.816 --> 01:35:10.276]  Okay, great.
[01:35:10.516 --> 01:35:20.161]  First one, an article that was published on Second has to do with an electrical engineer who was doing some maintenance on his laptop and moved the keyboard, and he found a device connecting...
[01:35:21.566 --> 01:35:35.352]  No, we posted that two weeks ago and we confirmed that all the new keyboards have a device that then dials in to the police and tells them every keystroke you've made.
[01:35:35.372 --> 01:35:42.735]  Then they sent a letter to the feds and Homeland Security and said, yeah, we're doing that, but it's none of your business.
[01:35:43.846 --> 01:35:44.387]  Okay, great.
[01:35:45.108 --> 01:35:48.993]  I don't necessarily agree to all the conclusions they've reached to, but it's certainly feasible.
[01:35:49.113 --> 01:35:51.616]  And I haven't seen this article carried really anywhere, so I don't know how credible it is.
[01:35:51.636 --> 01:35:53.118]  Well, it's like all the new cell phones.
[01:35:53.859 --> 01:35:57.343]  I mean, all the new cell phones really do track everywhere you go and what you do.
[01:35:58.024 --> 01:35:58.204]  Yes.
[01:35:58.605 --> 01:35:59.406]  All right, second article.
[01:35:59.446 --> 01:36:02.770]  This was today from the EFF, the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:36:03.226 --> 01:36:03.867]  Very credible.
[01:36:03.927 --> 01:36:07.890]  Anyway, they just released a report about midnight or so.
[01:36:07.930 --> 01:36:13.695]  That everything you do on your Xerox printer has it on there, and we knew that five years ago from industry publications.
[01:36:14.156 --> 01:36:14.556]  Excellent.
[01:36:14.596 --> 01:36:14.957]  Thank you.
[01:36:15.077 --> 01:36:15.477]  That's right.
[01:36:15.837 --> 01:36:17.699]  I'm not trying to show off that I know this.
[01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:19.581]  I have found as a tactic.
[01:36:20.081 --> 01:36:22.882]  That most listeners out there will never check out what you've said.
[01:36:22.903 --> 01:36:24.083]  They'll just say it's not true.
[01:36:24.363 --> 01:36:29.186]  But if I finish your sentences for you, though it's obnoxious, then it shocks them.
[01:36:29.446 --> 01:36:31.247]  See, people aren't about checking out facts.
[01:36:31.547 --> 01:36:34.208]  They want to be amazed and then, ooh, it must be true.
[01:36:34.568 --> 01:36:35.509]  Listen to me, people.
[01:36:35.869 --> 01:36:42.032]  That was the first article in my stack that I was going to get to, is everything you do will be tracked.
[01:36:42.252 --> 01:36:48.375]  They're going to have RFID that's in all ink by law, so everything you do will be tracked as well.
[01:36:49.338 --> 01:36:52.321]  Okay, well, the highlights of this article in particular is you need to know it.
[01:36:52.361 --> 01:36:54.282]  I don't know if your listeners have heard this yet.
[01:36:54.742 --> 01:37:02.189]  But there are at least one particular printer from Xerox, and they assume that many other printers from various other manufacturers have the same thing.
[01:37:02.209 --> 01:37:12.417]  But they have, on the color printers, special dot codes which give the serial number and date of the printout that's hidden, and it can be found to give you a process by which you could
[01:37:12.952 --> 01:37:16.015]  No, it's being built into the very backbone of the architecture.
[01:37:36.494 --> 01:37:36.714]  Yes.
[01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:51.018]  An extension for that was they gave an analogy, an example of people who are printing out materials, like pamphlets, via like, hey, go to Infowars.com, and how your printer might rat out who printed it out in the first place.
[01:37:51.038 --> 01:37:59.101]  A lot of people, even underground religious movements in other countries, are kind of relying on the anonymity of documents, printed material, and they're not getting that now.
[01:37:59.341 --> 01:38:03.822]  No, China, the Pentagon, and Walmart requested Xerox do that five years ago.
[01:38:04.921 --> 01:38:05.442]  Okay, great.
[01:38:05.542 --> 01:38:16.753]  So somebody needs to call the foundation up and teach them how to use Google so they can find the articles where five years ago, going from memory, a bunch of governments got together for exactly the reason they're talking about.
[01:38:17.694 --> 01:38:21.978]  Well, they may have gone to Google, but they published their research.
[01:38:22.318 --> 01:38:24.501]  No, I'm commending them.
[01:38:24.621 --> 01:38:28.825]  I'm just telling people this is real, and we've been reporting on it for five years.
[01:38:29.557 --> 01:38:30.137]  Great, great.
[01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:31.278]  Okay, comments.
[01:38:31.338 --> 01:38:36.781]  I heard a couple months ago you had commented on some video encodings that I made of your documentaries and put on the file sharing networks.
[01:38:36.821 --> 01:38:38.642]  I believe you didn't like the resolution I put them in.
[01:38:39.582 --> 01:38:42.224]  So there are a million people saying they're me.
[01:38:42.744 --> 01:38:43.124]  Believe me.
[01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:45.485]  I heard on your radio program.
[01:38:45.545 --> 01:38:47.907]  Okay, then I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:38:47.947 --> 01:38:50.988]  I don't remember saying I don't like the... That's fine.
[01:38:51.008 --> 01:38:52.529]  You know what?
[01:38:52.549 --> 01:38:53.429]  I have a pretty good memory.
[01:38:53.449 --> 01:38:54.490]  Specifically, what did I say?
[01:38:55.635 --> 01:39:01.137]  It was so long ago, I just remember you were commenting on people sharing your stuff on the file sharing networks.
[01:39:01.377 --> 01:39:02.918]  You're happy, and you looked at some samples.
[01:39:02.938 --> 01:39:04.198]  You're like, oh, I hate that.
[01:39:04.478 --> 01:39:06.079]  Who put this at half resolution?
[01:39:06.099 --> 01:39:08.920]  I believe it was probably one of mine, because I have a whole set up like that.
[01:39:09.320 --> 01:39:11.061]  You just thought it was too small of a screen.
[01:39:11.281 --> 01:39:12.381]  But that's really secondary.
[01:39:12.401 --> 01:39:13.041]  I want to get into that.
[01:39:13.382 --> 01:39:16.503]  But I do plan on making DVDs of your older VHS documentaries.
[01:39:17.981 --> 01:39:18.421]  I bet it does.
[01:39:18.441 --> 01:39:19.222]  I appreciate your call.
[01:39:19.242 --> 01:39:24.624]  Look, I mean, I don't even have the time, or frankly the money, to get around to putting my first five, six documentaries on DVD.
[01:39:45.157 --> 01:39:52.639]  Now, obviously, I could go out and have them burn the DVD right now, but I want to update them, and so I'm in the process of trying to do that right now.
[01:39:53.659 --> 01:40:00.921]  And, you know, I have people email me and say, can you just give me DVDs to sell, and I can't do that.
[01:40:01.741 --> 01:40:10.463]  And, yeah, if I tried to mail out source digital, you know, $35, $40 tapes, each one, I just can't do that.
[01:40:10.563 --> 01:40:10.983]  I can't.
[01:40:11.585 --> 01:40:13.825]  Listen, I haven't even plugged my videos yet today.
[01:40:14.245 --> 01:40:15.646]  You listen to most Patriot Radio.
[01:40:15.686 --> 01:40:19.006]  It's a three-hour infomercial with every magic cream available.
[01:40:19.026 --> 01:40:21.287]  You know, we don't do that here.
[01:40:22.347 --> 01:40:23.747]  That's why the feds criticize us.
[01:40:23.767 --> 01:40:28.268]  They say, oh, how dare Alex plug his videos when, you know, everything they do is plug, plug, plug.
[01:40:29.008 --> 01:40:31.108]  But we need your support.
[01:40:31.248 --> 01:40:32.869]  I mean, you know, to do the basic stuff.
[01:40:34.269 --> 01:40:39.550]  I mean, I literally care so little about money that I don't even plug my videos, and then I end up not having enough money to...
[01:40:40.453 --> 01:40:42.835]  Hire the people I need to just continue to operate.
[01:40:44.156 --> 01:40:49.861]  I mean, I get stuff like an email, oh, it's just a soul side issue.
[01:40:51.162 --> 01:40:52.964]  You know, I can't do much more, is the point.
[01:40:54.445 --> 01:40:57.508]  I really, I can say, hey, make copies of my videos.
[01:40:58.789 --> 01:41:02.592]  I can say, make copies of my videos for non-profit educational purposes.
[01:41:03.413 --> 01:41:05.655]  And then I get the email going, just give me your videos.
[01:41:07.296 --> 01:41:08.197]  And I just can't do it.
[01:41:10.447 --> 01:41:14.151]  I mean, I could give people videos for a couple months, and then I'd literally be homeless.
[01:41:14.751 --> 01:41:19.496]  And then I guess I could try to make documentaries with piles of dirt on the side of the highway.
[01:41:19.997 --> 01:41:23.941]  I could just sit there with piles of dirt and just kind of throw piles of dirt together.
[01:41:23.981 --> 01:41:26.083]  And then, ah, here's my new video.
[01:41:26.103 --> 01:41:26.724]  It's free.
[01:41:27.384 --> 01:41:33.731]  I could even find maybe tin cans on the side of the street and fill them with dirt and claim they were videos and just hand them to people as they drive by.
[01:41:34.568 --> 01:41:36.249]  But I can't give anymore.
[01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:37.270]  I can't do anymore.
[01:41:37.631 --> 01:41:40.413]  In fact, I've decided... I've said this before.
[01:41:40.453 --> 01:41:48.659]  I'm going to be cutting back on the amount of stuff I do because I think quality is better than quantity and beating my brains out is just pointless.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.321]  I'm going to spend more time with my family.
[01:41:51.341 --> 01:41:58.907]  I don't want to sit here and talk about myself all day, but sorry, I just really can't send you digital math.
[01:42:00.048 --> 01:42:01.850]  And I appreciate you trying to encode...
[01:42:02.515 --> 01:42:07.198]  The older videos and put them on DVD to give to people, that's all fine and dandy.
[01:42:08.539 --> 01:42:17.385]  You know, all I do is plug this when I talk about it, but I've told people you can make copies of my films for non-profit, educational, not-for-sale purposes.
[01:42:19.026 --> 01:42:19.947]  So what do people do?
[01:42:19.967 --> 01:42:22.608]  I mean, there's literally a thousand sites selling my videos.
[01:42:23.149 --> 01:42:28.693]  Get all twelve of them for ten dollars, and then I don't sell any videos.
[01:42:29.753 --> 01:42:32.195]  Which is kind of like killing the goose to get the eggs.
[01:42:34.488 --> 01:42:39.390]  I've kind of been too successful at telling people to make copies of the videos and get them out to people.
[01:42:41.031 --> 01:42:45.272]  Really, when you get the videos from us, you get the originals, so you do get the very best quality.
[01:42:46.533 --> 01:42:53.295]  And when you get the books and the other videos and DVDs we carry by other great authors, you support us as well as supporting them.
[01:42:53.995 --> 01:43:01.438]  And you know that the support you're sending gets a high-quality video into your hands that has been proven to wake people up.
[01:43:02.894 --> 01:43:13.563]  And at the very, very same time, the very, very same time, that's a new development, you know that you're supporting people that support freedom, and you get a tool.
[01:43:14.724 --> 01:43:17.386]  So I'm not going to sit here and belabor it.
[01:43:17.746 --> 01:43:20.689]  I want to thank the people that have gotten our films.
[01:43:21.369 --> 01:43:24.011]  I want to thank the people that have gotten them and made copies of them.
[01:43:25.953 --> 01:43:31.017]  I want to thank the individuals out there that have put them on AXS television.
[01:43:32.503 --> 01:43:45.900]  And I want to encourage you, if you do have my videos and you haven't made copies of them and you haven't given them to your pastor or your rabbi or your neighbor or your school teacher or your professor, please do.
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.582]  It's having a massive effect.
[01:43:48.423 --> 01:43:49.885]  And if you do want to support us,
[01:43:51.576 --> 01:43:54.979]  You can call toll-free and ask about the different specials.
[01:43:54.999 --> 01:43:57.901]  There's a bunch of different choices you've got to take advantage of.
[01:43:58.361 --> 01:44:00.943]  You can get my new film, Martial Law, that really is my best work.
[01:44:01.003 --> 01:44:03.005]  I mean, it's TV quality.
[01:44:03.025 --> 01:44:12.031]  I mean, it's well-produced, shot on big digital cameras, a lot of really incredible footage, proves the globalists carried out 9-11, how they did it, why they did it.
[01:44:12.051 --> 01:44:14.273]  It's a very important film.
[01:44:15.754 --> 01:44:20.898]  Then there's all my other films, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, American Dictators.
[01:44:22.242 --> 01:44:23.443]  Innocence Betrayed.
[01:44:25.104 --> 01:44:29.246]  Jim Tucker's New Bilderberg Group Diary.
[01:44:29.446 --> 01:44:32.327]  You can read Project Lucent, written back in 1995.
[01:44:32.908 --> 01:44:36.950]  You'll learn more about RFID and the latest books coming out on the subject.
[01:44:37.670 --> 01:44:38.531]  Believe me, I've read them.
[01:44:39.731 --> 01:44:40.532]  By Tex Mars.
[01:44:40.552 --> 01:44:48.796]  You'll learn more reading that sucker from 1995 about the control grid, because he's a space and aeronautics professor, and he just went to the industry publications.
[01:44:51.877 --> 01:45:04.410]  If you want Bloodlines of the Illuminati, or really go down the rabbit hole and find out how deep and dark and scary it gets, then go to Infowars.com, and your purchase of that book also helps.
[01:45:06.212 --> 01:45:11.958]  Fritz Springmeier's wife, who's been faithfully by his side since he was falsely imprisoned as a political prisoner.
[01:45:16.064 --> 01:45:24.227]  You need to go to the bookstore on InfoWars.com, and you need to get the documentary films, the books, the videos.
[01:45:25.107 --> 01:45:27.248]  You need to make copies of them and get them out to folks.
[01:45:28.369 --> 01:45:29.609]  Your support is vital.
[01:45:29.889 --> 01:45:32.330]  Here's the toll-free number, if you'd rather order that way.
[01:45:32.350 --> 01:45:33.250]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:33.511]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:45:46.130 --> 01:45:57.259]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:45:59.481 --> 01:46:10.509]  Or go to prisonplanet.tv, where for 15 cents a day, only 15 cents a day, you get all my videos, all my weekly TV reports, a whole bunch of special video reports.
[01:46:10.569 --> 01:46:12.491]  I do multiple special reports every month.
[01:46:13.371 --> 01:46:15.233]  Travel the world to bring you this information.
[01:46:17.675 --> 01:46:24.377]  My e-book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other e-books, a bunch of other films, my best audio interviews, special text reports.
[01:46:25.078 --> 01:46:30.660]  Now a year and a half of operation, prisonplanet.tv, and I want to thank you for your support.
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:34.061]  But literally, when you're a member of Prison Planet, it's really a donation.
[01:46:34.081 --> 01:46:34.761]  You're supporting us.
[01:46:35.241 --> 01:46:37.122]  When you get one of the videos, it's a donation.
[01:46:37.142 --> 01:46:37.822]  You're supporting us.
[01:46:39.583 --> 01:46:41.403]  And people want magic bullets.
[01:46:41.463 --> 01:46:42.764]  They want cure-alls.
[01:46:42.844 --> 01:46:46.085]  They want instant gratification, instant fixes.
[01:46:46.784 --> 01:46:48.805]  And folks, those don't exist.
[01:46:51.627 --> 01:46:57.231]  So many people jump at the federal governments, we're going to save you, we're going to take care of you, just give up all your rights.
[01:46:57.711 --> 01:47:02.454]  They can't take care of you, they don't want to take care of you, and they're very criminal.
[01:47:04.095 --> 01:47:08.638]  You've got a lot of opportunistic talk show hosts too, who've got all their magic bullets for you.
[01:47:09.659 --> 01:47:13.401]  And there's just a literal magazine of lies.
[01:47:13.982 --> 01:47:16.103]  An entire arsenal of bulls.
[01:47:17.597 --> 01:47:19.058]  But deep down, you know it's bull.
[01:47:19.738 --> 01:47:21.599]  We're not going to sit here and give you silver bullets.
[01:47:21.619 --> 01:47:24.841]  The only silver bullet I know of is Jesus Christ.
[01:47:25.621 --> 01:47:31.844]  Even then, folks, if you aren't every day driven to fight evil, then God isn't in your heart, I'll tell you right now.
[01:47:32.265 --> 01:47:34.326]  And again, it's another salve.
[01:47:35.666 --> 01:47:38.388]  You've got to put doing the right thing first in your life, folks.
[01:47:38.428 --> 01:47:41.049]  You've got to put sacrifice first in your life.
[01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:43.330]  And that means having a moral compass.
[01:47:44.031 --> 01:47:46.692]  You know, I could make a lot of money with magic cures and
[01:47:47.748 --> 01:47:51.990]  You know, all that stuff, and I just won't do it because I could care less.
[01:47:52.110 --> 01:47:55.132]  I really, and the problem is it's getting worse and worse.
[01:47:55.192 --> 01:47:57.733]  I mean, I've got to have some ego to do this.
[01:47:57.813 --> 01:48:06.058]  I've got to want to generate money at a certain point so I can keep doing what I'm doing and maybe expand and I know do an even better job.
[01:48:06.098 --> 01:48:09.540]  But I just, I don't like.
[01:48:10.180 --> 01:48:15.343]  I'm not somebody you'd see out in the market at the bazaar
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:17.680]  You know, pitching my wares.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:22.281]  I mean, I guess when I do it, I do a pretty good carnival barker job of it.
[01:48:22.861 --> 01:48:24.702]  But, you know, it's not hype, folks.
[01:48:24.762 --> 01:48:26.342]  It's not no brag, just fact.
[01:48:26.982 --> 01:48:31.523]  When I say the videos will wake people up, they'll heal your mind.
[01:48:31.583 --> 01:48:33.884]  They'll unlock the propaganda.
[01:48:33.924 --> 01:48:37.825]  They will give you the truth when it comes to what's happening in this world.
[01:48:39.545 --> 01:48:39.665]  And...
[01:48:42.091 --> 01:48:51.779]  That's a key part of our bodies, is our brains, that are literally brimming, overflowing with propaganda and lies.
[01:48:53.120 --> 01:48:57.983]  And we can take this country back, but I'm beginning to realize we've got to clean up our own shop first.
[01:48:58.944 --> 01:49:01.166]  We've got to deal with our own problems first.
[01:49:01.286 --> 01:49:03.087]  That includes my own personal problems.
[01:49:03.748 --> 01:49:07.651]  Before we're able to fix the world, we've got to get the beam out of our own eyes.
[01:49:08.613 --> 01:49:09.834]  That starts with the family.
[01:49:09.874 --> 01:49:11.674]  That starts with your finances.
[01:49:11.714 --> 01:49:14.856]  That starts with putting the proper priorities first.
[01:49:15.816 --> 01:49:17.477]  And so I challenge all of you to do that.
[01:49:17.557 --> 01:49:20.898]  And you can certainly challenge me or point out what I'm doing that's wrong.
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:24.560]  All right.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:25.420]  You know what I'm going to do?
[01:49:25.520 --> 01:49:28.281]  I'm going to finish up with the callers we've got.
[01:49:28.621 --> 01:49:30.302]  Dr. Deagle wants to disagree with me.
[01:49:31.403 --> 01:49:32.343]  Eric in Connecticut.
[01:49:34.523 --> 01:49:36.545]  Joe, Rodney, and Terry.
[01:49:37.086 --> 01:49:38.327]  That's all the calls I'm taking.
[01:49:38.347 --> 01:49:49.719]  We've got a whole other hour and nine minutes ahead of us, but I'll take those calls and that's it, because this news has got to be covered, and I'm trying to discipline myself to get to it all.
[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:51.421]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.817 --> 01:50:00.639]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.959 --> 01:50:02.320]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.520 --> 01:50:04.720]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:06.961]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.241 --> 01:50:12.183]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.523 --> 01:50:16.544]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.804 --> 01:50:18.565]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:29.290]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.450 --> 01:50:31.351]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.551 --> 01:50:35.413]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:50:35.513 --> 01:50:36.934]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.

[01:50:53.603 --> 01:50:57.185]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[01:50:57.225 --> 01:50:57.725]  are located?
[01:50:57.925 --> 01:51:01.327]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[01:51:01.547 --> 01:51:06.270]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[01:51:06.530 --> 01:51:11.533]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[01:51:11.653 --> 01:51:12.353]  We're good to go.
[01:51:29.178 --> 01:51:31.160]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web or at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:51:54.488 --> 01:52:00.430]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:00.650 --> 01:52:02.911]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:52:30.131 --> 01:52:30.651]  We're good to go.
[01:52:54.417 --> 01:52:59.541]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:00.221 --> 01:53:02.503]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:12.409 --> 01:53:13.409]  We're good to go.
[01:53:41.545 --> 01:53:45.928]  Yes, a rogue group that won't lie for them and that is exposing them as traitors.
[01:53:46.789 --> 01:53:49.851]  Senior military torture investigator found dead in Iraq.
[01:53:50.332 --> 01:53:53.274]  I mentioned this yesterday, but they obviously killed this guy.
[01:53:53.594 --> 01:53:54.975]  They're now saying it looks like murder.
[01:53:55.756 --> 01:53:56.997]  They fragged him.
[01:53:58.038 --> 01:54:04.603]  And then, of course, EFF reveals codes in Xerox printers, Associated Press.
[01:54:05.703 --> 01:54:06.844]  And I'm not tooting our horn.
[01:54:07.004 --> 01:54:09.486]  I talked about this five years ago, and I remember the emails.
[01:54:09.526 --> 01:54:10.227]  You're an idiot.
[01:54:10.848 --> 01:54:12.730]  It was in the industry publications.
[01:54:13.351 --> 01:54:15.373]  They're going to have RFID in the ink soon.
[01:54:15.393 --> 01:54:17.955]  In fact, I believe some cartridges already have it.
[01:54:19.237 --> 01:54:22.660]  And bird flu virus revealed in two more Russian villages.
[01:54:23.581 --> 01:54:26.103]  But Charlie Reese is saying don't worry about the bird flu.
[01:54:26.123 --> 01:54:27.945]  I guess Dr. Deagle disagrees with him.
[01:54:27.965 --> 01:54:30.548]  We'll get Dr. Deagle in order here in a few minutes.
[01:54:32.406 --> 01:54:33.927]  Free market news starts to get it.
[01:54:33.947 --> 01:54:37.370]  It says Iraq war was to destabilize the oil market.
[01:54:37.450 --> 01:54:38.351]  I totally agree.
[01:54:38.831 --> 01:54:42.314]  Colonel Roberts says martial law come into a neighborhood near you.
[01:54:44.676 --> 01:54:47.058]  And we'll get into much more in the next hour.
[01:54:47.078 --> 01:54:50.361]  I'm just taking a few more calls because I need to cover this news.
[01:54:50.381 --> 01:54:52.763]  Although the listeners tend to bring up all the news.
[01:54:53.443 --> 01:54:57.447]  Anyways, let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:54:59.418 --> 01:55:00.419]  Eric in Connecticut.
[01:55:00.459 --> 01:55:01.199]  Eric, go ahead.
[01:55:01.639 --> 01:55:01.999]  Hey, Alex.
[01:55:02.039 --> 01:55:03.500]  Welcome from Skull and Bones country.
[01:55:03.980 --> 01:55:05.921]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:06.881 --> 01:55:13.664]  I heard your monologue in the first hour, and frankly, I think you're a lot more eloquent than you give yourself credit for.
[01:55:14.985 --> 01:55:16.225]  Okay.
[01:55:17.446 --> 01:55:26.910]  Interesting movie I saw over the weekend with my wife and one of her girlfriends, the new Wallace and Gromit movie, Curse of the Were-Rabbit, it's called.
[01:55:27.759 --> 01:55:32.001]  And there were some very subtle but very powerful anti-gun messages in that movie.
[01:55:32.021 --> 01:55:37.203]  In fact, I'm doing a little article to email to you at tipsandinfowars.com.
[01:55:37.763 --> 01:55:42.925]  It includes a photograph where the... Well, be sure and go over to Prison Planet.
[01:55:43.385 --> 01:55:43.505]  Okay.
[01:55:43.545 --> 01:55:46.046]  Be sure and send it to prisonplanet at hotmail.com.
[01:55:47.765 --> 01:55:53.308]  Because by sending it both places, we'll tend to get it posted better than just sending it to one.
[01:55:53.328 --> 01:55:54.769]  Okay, brief synopsis.
[01:55:55.149 --> 01:56:01.032]  It's said in England that this guy and his dog are humane pest control people.
[01:56:02.313 --> 01:56:10.177]  And the locals have gardens and somehow this rabbit's getting in, this giant rabbit's getting in.
[01:56:10.277 --> 01:56:13.698]  It's obviously a very juvenile plot, but here it is.
[01:56:14.419 --> 01:56:15.079]  Target the kids.
[01:56:15.785 --> 01:56:23.151]  This juvenile rabbit gets into the gardens, and there's this loutish Englishman who has a rifle, and he's the only one with a rifle.
[01:56:23.632 --> 01:56:29.136]  And he's a lout, he's boorish, you know, he's ignorant, he's brash.
[01:56:29.857 --> 01:56:36.382]  And there's a real, what I noticed was, a very, very subtle but very powerful anti-gun message.
[01:56:36.402 --> 01:56:39.645]  Well, yeah, you're an evil ogre if you own a gun.
[01:56:39.825 --> 01:56:42.087]  Oh, it just was incredible.
[01:56:43.261 --> 01:56:43.822]  I'll do that.
[01:56:44.142 --> 01:56:46.504]  I'll send you this little write-up I have.
[01:56:47.825 --> 01:56:54.711]  I also wanted to mention, I look at my paycheck at work, and I do a slow burn every time I see the taxes taken out.
[01:56:55.291 --> 01:57:11.745]  You did a video a few years back called Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed, which was really, frankly, quite an epiphany for me because you had people on your broadcast, and I was wondering if you could briefly go over
[01:57:12.236 --> 01:57:23.702]  The whole issue of how these governments hide trillions of dollars in slush funds, how we could not even pay any taxes if it was done right and scrupulously, and just how we're getting raked over the coals.
[01:57:25.042 --> 01:57:25.583]  Absolutely.
[01:57:25.623 --> 01:57:29.484]  I'll try to answer that question when we get back, and I appreciate your call, my friend.
[01:57:29.524 --> 01:57:29.965]  Take care.
[01:57:30.065 --> 01:57:31.245]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:33.566 --> 01:57:38.229]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.824 --> 01:57:50.464]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.125 --> 01:57:52.205]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.905 --> 01:57:54.025]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.665 --> 01:57:55.485]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.226 --> 01:57:57.226]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.786 --> 01:58:01.447]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.987 --> 01:58:06.107]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.488 --> 01:58:10.228]  Now into hour number three.
[01:58:10.268 --> 01:58:12.449]  We're just going to take four more phone calls.
[01:58:12.649 --> 01:58:13.949]  Dr. Deagle disagrees with me.
[01:58:15.300 --> 01:58:18.262]  So we're going to go ahead and go to Dr. Deagle now.
[01:58:18.302 --> 01:58:20.943]  He's been a guest on this show, a very interesting, informative fellow.
[01:58:20.963 --> 01:58:25.786]  And then we're going to finish up with Joe, Rodney, and Terry.
[01:58:25.806 --> 01:58:33.810]  And then I'm just covering news, hopefully in a calm fashion, for the balance of this third and final hour.
[01:58:35.371 --> 01:58:37.252]  Let's go ahead and go to Dr. Deagle.
[01:58:37.312 --> 01:58:38.693]  Dr. Deagle, how are you doing?
[01:58:39.393 --> 01:58:40.434]  Just wonderful.
[01:58:40.474 --> 01:58:42.915]  Your show is, as always, very informative and informative.
[01:58:43.699 --> 01:58:46.301]  But I do disagree on one very important point.
[01:58:46.701 --> 01:58:48.682]  Well, that's certainly what it's all about.
[01:58:48.722 --> 01:58:49.743]  What do you disagree with?
[01:58:49.843 --> 01:59:01.331]  Well, I agree that this has been used as a terror tactic, and having worked in Operation Top Off and Dark Winter and taught the course for the American Academy of Environmental Medicine and worked directly with Special Op and Delta.
[01:59:01.591 --> 01:59:03.412]  You're talking about bird flu right now.
[01:59:03.452 --> 01:59:05.053]  Yeah, the bird flu is really serious.
[01:59:06.094 --> 01:59:11.177]  What's happened is, it's my opinion that this bird flu is weaponized.
[01:59:11.887 --> 01:59:14.089]  That there are two genes that they've actually modified.
[01:59:14.549 --> 01:59:19.812]  Bill Sardi, and it's in mainstream news, got the same info, that somebody's injecting the birds with it.
[01:59:20.133 --> 01:59:23.135]  Yeah, well, I don't know if I believe that, but here's what, there are two genes.
[01:59:23.255 --> 01:59:34.542]  One's called the PB2 gene, that they, all of a sudden, the K, which is a human gene, has appeared in position 627 in just the last few years, and all over Asia.
[01:59:35.183 --> 01:59:40.286]  And secondly, there's a deletion that hasn't appeared before, but they've been playing around with this 1918 flu that they got,
[01:59:41.949 --> 01:59:51.411]  It was funded by the Rothschilds, was resurrected, and they actually built the virus in Atlanta, and they have it in a BSL-3 laboratory in Madison, Wisconsin.
[01:59:51.431 --> 02:00:07.396]  Now, this virus has the same deletion, listen to this, in the NS1 gene that allows it to not produce interleukin-4, so it bypasses all mammals' immune systems so they get overwhelmed with virus and get a massive cytokine release, and it's the same deletion as 1918 flu.
[02:00:08.096 --> 02:00:08.916]  So how did that happen?
[02:00:09.338 --> 02:00:11.379]  It happened because they genetically engineered it.
[02:00:11.699 --> 02:00:17.783]  Now, what I think is happening is they don't yet have a flu that travels quickly between people, so it's not pandemic yet.
[02:00:18.323 --> 02:00:20.945]  Yeah, it hasn't mutated where it's airborne yet.
[02:00:21.205 --> 02:00:22.406]  There are several ways for it to happen.
[02:00:22.446 --> 02:00:38.236]  First is, and this is just a hypothesis, so I don't take this to the gospel, but I think, number one, the virus could be sitting literally in a laboratory already pre-engineered with the receptor binding gene, which is a tiny little section of just one of the eight genes that allow it to attach to human cells.
[02:00:38.516 --> 02:00:38.936]  Number one.
[02:00:39.471 --> 02:00:48.213]  Number two, it could recombine in birds with the H7 flu that contains human genes in Europe, which they know already is there from research I've done on Dr. Nyman.
[02:00:49.013 --> 02:00:54.475]  Or it could combine in pigs or humans if they just get the regular flu and get this bird flu.
[02:00:54.535 --> 02:01:01.876]  So we now have millions of chances, and all you need is one teeny little cleavage point gene section to transfer.
[02:01:02.696 --> 02:01:04.797]  And once it starts to jump from one cell to another,
[02:01:05.325 --> 02:01:16.994]  And it's my viewpoint that the government has completely, these above-government organizations like the Council on Foreign Relations, the World Health Organization, I was told this in 97 at HLI in Zurich when I privately met with the International Board.
[02:01:17.595 --> 02:01:25.561]  They told me they were actually working, that the WHO was working in these clandestine labs working on the flu back then in the 90s.
[02:01:26.682 --> 02:01:33.788]  So I know that this is coming and they're using it to bring us into and to force the chip into everybody for
[02:01:34.835 --> 02:01:36.577]  They have quarantine stations now.
[02:01:37.097 --> 02:01:41.720]  They're just examining rooms in something like 18-plus international airports, U.S.
[02:01:41.780 --> 02:01:43.541]  airports now, today.
[02:01:44.182 --> 02:01:52.928]  And they're planning on having it set up so they can have a lockdown room where they can transfer you sterilely to a vehicle that can take you to a FEMA detention facility.
[02:01:53.368 --> 02:01:54.509]  That's already happened.
[02:01:55.669 --> 02:01:58.691]  So it's my viewpoint that this flu is not yet at that step.
[02:01:59.212 --> 02:02:02.394]  Now, this is only my hypothesis, but it seems very strange that we have
[02:02:03.627 --> 02:02:25.295]  Plans by STRATCOM to attack Iran at the very same time we have Pakistan that has a mutual defense treaty with Iran having a huge earthquake, number one, and we have China having a major outbreak of this bird flu in Asia occurring, which I absolutely am certain that this was weaponized.
[02:02:26.596 --> 02:02:32.778]  So, yes, we're not there with pandemic flu, but it's on its way and it's nasty, and they're planning to bring in a new world order with this flu.
[02:02:33.692 --> 02:02:37.094]  Well, let's talk about it for a few minutes more on the other side, Dr. Deagle, if you can.
[02:02:37.915 --> 02:02:39.516]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:02:56.727 --> 02:03:03.432]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.772 --> 02:03:05.753]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.953 --> 02:03:08.815]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.895 --> 02:03:13.558]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.758 --> 02:03:18.180]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.400 --> 02:03:25.624]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:47.381 --> 02:03:48.402]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.742 --> 02:03:51.524]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.784 --> 02:03:55.947]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.368 --> 02:03:57.208]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.529 --> 02:04:02.092]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.572 --> 02:04:03.173]  We're good to go.

[02:06:07.641 --> 02:06:14.083]  Got about 51 minutes left in this World Wide Transmission against global tyranny.
[02:06:15.203 --> 02:06:16.664]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:06:16.684 --> 02:06:18.084]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:18.905 --> 02:06:38.613]  I'm going to finish up with Dr. Deagle here in a moment, who called in to disagree with me about the severity of the avian bird flu, now spreading into different areas of Europe, as far south as Greece, and as far west as far western Russia.
[02:06:39.893 --> 02:06:43.835]  But before we go back to Dr. Deagle, let me just be clear about this.
[02:06:45.732 --> 02:06:49.315]  I've talked to a lot of doctors, a lot of virologists, a lot of scientists.
[02:06:50.756 --> 02:06:54.939]  I have interviewed a lot of health reporters that have been tracking this for a long time.
[02:06:56.861 --> 02:07:00.284]  But before I get into it, let me just build a foundation here.
[02:07:03.106 --> 02:07:14.755]  I remember five, six years ago when the military team, and now they're the team in control of it in Wisconsin, went up near the North Pole and dug up
[02:07:15.521 --> 02:07:16.242]  We're good to go.
[02:07:39.142 --> 02:07:40.903]  They're not even going to mention where it came from.
[02:07:40.923 --> 02:07:48.828]  They're just going to say, suddenly it's a new threat again, or it's magically popped up again, and then at the same time, oh, they're going to have it in a laboratory.
[02:07:48.868 --> 02:07:58.313]  Well, simultaneously, this new avian flu has popped up, and it's almost identical to the 1918 flu that killed 50 million people conservatively.
[02:08:00.314 --> 02:08:08.779]  And then magically, oh, they've designed it all by themselves as well in another laboratory, and oh, terrorists might have it, and so just get ready to be hit by it.
[02:08:12.319 --> 02:08:24.284]  And we'd better give up all of our freedoms to martial law, as Henry Kissinger said at a Bilderberg group meeting in 1991, if there was a bio-attack, we would accept and beg for foreign troops.
[02:08:25.564 --> 02:08:33.387]  And now, Bush has got foreign troops here for the emergency in New Orleans, which they helped deepen and exacerbate.
[02:08:34.384 --> 02:08:36.806]  And oh, now they're talking about foreign assets.
[02:08:36.886 --> 02:08:47.672]  If our troops are tied down fighting the war on terror, why, if we've got some type of outbreak, our friends in Canada and Mexico and Europe may have to come here to save us.
[02:08:47.772 --> 02:08:50.874]  And Bush might have to be dictator for life.
[02:08:51.866 --> 02:08:56.148]  Why, if the bird flu comes in a couple of years, see, I think this is all training right now.
[02:08:56.548 --> 02:08:58.789]  Now they're saying, oh, it might be next year or the next year.
[02:08:59.449 --> 02:09:01.310]  Oh, it might come during the election.
[02:09:01.670 --> 02:09:03.371]  We might cancel the election.
[02:09:03.631 --> 02:09:05.872]  Oh, martial law might be needed.
[02:09:05.892 --> 02:09:11.195]  And they've told police departments all over the country, well, we'll have to confiscate guns.
[02:09:11.795 --> 02:09:14.976]  During a breakdown in quarantine, we can't have citizens having guns.
[02:09:16.877 --> 02:09:20.659]  But then scientists who are on government payroll go, having a quarantine won't stop it.
[02:09:21.377 --> 02:09:22.118]  Won't do anything.
[02:09:22.158 --> 02:09:23.458]  These birds can fly anywhere.
[02:09:24.039 --> 02:09:25.400]  People will be all over the place.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:28.462]  The military is going to be in contained facilities.
[02:09:28.482 --> 02:09:31.103]  They'll be the biggest spreaders of it, bar none.
[02:09:31.664 --> 02:09:36.707]  This Tamiflu that, of course, Rumsfeld owns doesn't even really help you.
[02:09:37.267 --> 02:09:38.969]  There's natural remedies that are much better.
[02:09:39.329 --> 02:09:42.531]  So all this is going on, and obviously the evidence shows that
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:45.421]  The Japanese are saying it's just showing up.
[02:09:45.461 --> 02:09:49.582]  The Chinese are saying it's just showing up in birds with no connection to other birds.
[02:09:50.042 --> 02:09:55.984]  Dozens of places all over the world simultaneously in bird crops that haven't been exported or moved.
[02:09:57.725 --> 02:09:59.445]  So it does look like it's being implanted.
[02:09:59.485 --> 02:10:01.206]  It does look like it's manufactured.
[02:10:02.006 --> 02:10:03.447]  All the evidence points towards that.
[02:10:05.027 --> 02:10:10.329]  And yes, if it adds the coupler genes to be able to hook up
[02:10:11.804 --> 02:10:20.652]  And spread from human to human instead of animal, pig or bird to human, we'll have a big problem.
[02:10:20.672 --> 02:10:26.278]  But we're not 1918 where we're malnourished and people are in the trenches and there's fleas everywhere.
[02:10:26.298 --> 02:10:29.080]  I mean, there's a lot of things you can do.
[02:10:29.201 --> 02:10:31.282]  And they say it has a 50% kill rate.
[02:10:32.083 --> 02:10:34.886]  Well, that's 50% of those that go to the hospital.
[02:10:35.450 --> 02:10:40.133]  But then you look at the statistics, 95% of people with this flu aren't going to the hospital.
[02:10:40.173 --> 02:10:41.514]  And they say 60 dead.
[02:10:41.594 --> 02:10:46.036]  Then they say they've got a vaccine for you, but clearly the vaccine won't even protect you.
[02:10:46.517 --> 02:10:47.557]  Another big scam.
[02:10:47.958 --> 02:10:57.083]  And the globalists have said that they want to get us into compact cities, get us in a police state grid, which they're doing with terror, and then start killing us with bioweapons.
[02:10:57.123 --> 02:10:58.384]  So I have no doubt that
[02:10:59.241 --> 02:11:09.448]  In the next decade, we're all going to be dying in mass in huge extermination squads and martial law that goes along with that because that's the globalist plan, unless we expose them.
[02:11:10.889 --> 02:11:13.671]  Remember they said smallpox is going to break out.
[02:11:13.891 --> 02:11:15.172]  We know terrorists have got it.
[02:11:15.232 --> 02:11:15.992]  It's going to happen.
[02:11:16.993 --> 02:11:24.138]  And then they said 14 million first responders, firefighters, medical workers, police, military, you've all got to take it.
[02:11:24.739 --> 02:11:29.903]  And 99 plus percent said no, and so suddenly smallpox wasn't going to get us any minute.
[02:11:31.484 --> 02:11:33.425]  SARS was going to kill a billion people.
[02:11:33.505 --> 02:11:33.925]  Why?
[02:11:34.306 --> 02:11:39.409]  They had to quarantine areas of Dallas and Toronto, Canada, and it's all over.
[02:11:39.489 --> 02:11:41.130]  Now you don't hear about SARS anymore.
[02:11:41.190 --> 02:11:48.375]  So, make no mistake, I mean, these bloody-minded killers are probably going to pull something.
[02:11:48.415 --> 02:11:50.457]  But now we've already got...
[02:11:51.744 --> 02:11:53.364]  Well, here's an article of a London Independent.
[02:11:53.924 --> 02:11:58.685]  Bird flu will kill 50,000 people in London or in England alone, but not this year.
[02:11:59.906 --> 02:12:07.147]  A bird flu pandemic would kill about 50,000 people in Britain, but not necessarily strike this winter, the government's chief medical officer said Wednesday.
[02:12:07.647 --> 02:12:18.449]  Sir Liam Donaldson said that it was a question of when, not if, the disease-infected birds in Asia and the fringes of Eastern Europe mutated into the deadly form of human influenza.
[02:12:20.089 --> 02:12:22.750]  The last five years they announced it's going to be deadly every year.
[02:12:23.190 --> 02:12:25.670]  Idiots line up and get it, and they get their Alzheimer's.
[02:12:26.330 --> 02:12:34.232]  The number of deaths in Britain could reach 750,000 if the human strain were particularly serious, although a lower figure was more realistic, he said.
[02:12:35.632 --> 02:12:37.472]  But what will martial law do to keep you safe?
[02:12:37.512 --> 02:12:37.773]  Nothing.
[02:12:38.573 --> 02:12:44.694]  But see, you won't worry about politics or high gas prices or being ripped off or losing your jobs.
[02:12:45.373 --> 02:12:48.155]  As we go into the globalist economy, all this is happening.
[02:12:48.175 --> 02:12:49.675]  These are endless diversions.
[02:12:50.116 --> 02:13:05.004]  In a typical year, influenza kills about 12,000 people in the UK, mostly the elderly, and the infirm Sir Liam's comments came as the government prepared to contact every GP in the country about the threat of the flu pandemic.
[02:13:05.944 --> 02:13:09.246]  Dr. Deagle, your comments on what I've said.
[02:13:09.746 --> 02:13:11.567]  Well, there's a couple things.
[02:13:11.647 --> 02:13:12.468]  The first is that
[02:13:13.507 --> 02:13:17.010]  Number one, these other things, SARS and so on, I agree.
[02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:23.674]  In fact, one of my contacts inside Bethesda told me that the SARS was probably a race-specific virus, but it's not a very good one.
[02:13:23.714 --> 02:13:25.936]  Coronaviruses are not very deadly.
[02:13:26.416 --> 02:13:32.540]  Repeatedly from my contacts, they've told me that they've been working on engineering the flu.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:38.404]  When they got this virus fragment from this obese whaler, they actually didn't have the whole virus.
[02:13:38.604 --> 02:13:40.065]  So it took them seven years
[02:13:40.817 --> 02:13:41.657]  Resurrect the virus.
[02:13:41.697 --> 02:13:47.118]  Yeah, I have read they didn't have the whole virus, but I've also read they did find the whole virus, and now they just completed it.
[02:13:47.178 --> 02:13:50.519]  What they did is they actually used biogene engines to actually build it.
[02:13:51.419 --> 02:14:04.282]  And what's really, not strange, but really evil, is that all of a sudden, as you say, this is appearing all of a sudden in bird populations that are isolated that couldn't possibly get the same genetics, and also on its own,
[02:14:04.790 --> 02:14:05.510]  They're evolving.
[02:14:05.550 --> 02:14:16.913]  So there's six strains in Asia that are mild, like a flu, regular flu, and there's six strains that are extremely deadly, all genetically distinct, like the ones in Qinghai province of China, completely distinct from the ones in Vietnam.
[02:14:16.933 --> 02:14:21.394]  So the vaccine, you're right, is useless, and it's all laced with mercury and so on that'll cause brain damage.
[02:14:22.574 --> 02:14:29.016]  Their policy, you're right, of martial law will cause more deaths rather than just post-quarantine, which people can do on their own.
[02:14:30.056 --> 02:14:34.217]  What they're doing is trying to maximize death and trying to stick the damn chip in people, and
[02:14:34.775 --> 02:14:51.542]  The real final thing here is I believe they've got the final weaponized strain sitting in a lab somewhere now, ready to release it when they want, and either spray it in an aircraft over China or whatever, and that their plan is when it's opportune and they want to roll the cells, they'll do it.
[02:14:52.382 --> 02:14:55.243]  But the problem is that the virus itself is completely out of control.
[02:14:55.263 --> 02:15:02.346]  In the words of Dr. Nyman, it doesn't matter if it came from a bioweapons lab or if it comes spontaneously.
[02:15:03.263 --> 02:15:06.764]  This virus... Well, I'll just give up all my rights, and then I'll be okay.
[02:15:06.864 --> 02:15:10.405]  Well, you know, first off, I think that's... I think we don't need to give up our rights.
[02:15:10.425 --> 02:15:16.287]  In fact, I confronted the FEMA director... But the government says they want to kill us in their own documents, so I should trust them.
[02:15:16.528 --> 02:15:17.268]  Yeah, right.
[02:15:17.748 --> 02:15:32.633]  I'm going to tell you right from the inside that the plans that this evil... call it government plans and the globalists is so damn evil, and I've heard from so many sources on the inside that they plan that this avian flu withers
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:42.765]  And the problem is, once the virus is endemic, they'll use it as plausible deniability to say, oh, well, just recombine, and now it's all of a sudden hit France, or it's all of a sudden hit America or China.
[02:15:43.465 --> 02:15:46.507]  So they're going to have plausible deniability to say, well, it just emerged.
[02:15:47.567 --> 02:15:56.632]  And they even sent around the 1957 to 68 version in test kits to thousands of different labs in 18 countries, just in the last couple of years from the
[02:15:57.193 --> 02:15:57.793]  No, I know.
[02:15:58.133 --> 02:15:59.614]  That broke about six months ago.
[02:15:59.634 --> 02:16:00.634]  Yeah, isn't it crazy?
[02:16:00.774 --> 02:16:02.715]  For more plausible deniability.
[02:16:02.775 --> 02:16:06.456]  And then, of course, they've got the BSL-3 lab, which is insane.
[02:16:06.516 --> 02:16:11.157]  It's not a negative pressure lab in Madison, Wisconsin, where they actually rebuilt the 1918 flu.
[02:16:12.178 --> 02:16:15.179]  And the director there said... Well, but listen, we've got to leave that wide open.
[02:16:15.199 --> 02:16:16.739]  We've got to leave the borders wide open.
[02:16:16.959 --> 02:16:20.720]  To keep us safe, though, Dr. Deagle, we need police checkpoints in Indiana.
[02:16:20.880 --> 02:16:26.302]  Yeah, we've got to have a camera watching my butt going down the street in Denver if I'm visiting friends, right?
[02:16:26.778 --> 02:16:28.980]  Or traveling in San Francisco like I was there two weeks ago.
[02:16:29.460 --> 02:16:35.005]  But they've got to leave the borders wide open so they can let illegals with resistant TB and leprosy come across the border.
[02:16:36.006 --> 02:16:38.168]  Well, that's because leprosy fights Al-Qaeda.
[02:16:38.408 --> 02:16:39.629]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:40.309 --> 02:16:41.010]  This is deadly.
[02:16:41.050 --> 02:16:50.278]  And when they want to kill millions or they want to force the national ID and the world ID on us, they're going to release this damn thing because I think that they're going to try to force us
[02:16:51.101 --> 02:16:52.402]  Into this world ID.
[02:16:52.482 --> 02:16:54.104]  The government wouldn't do that.
[02:16:54.144 --> 02:16:54.524]  They love us.
[02:16:54.544 --> 02:16:55.405]  The government will do it.
[02:16:55.465 --> 02:17:01.890]  I tell you from my friends on Delta... After the pandemic of 06, we were forced to go to a world ID card.
[02:17:02.010 --> 02:17:02.511]  Exactly.
[02:17:02.551 --> 02:17:05.233]  And then once this virus is endemic, it's going to be there for decades.
[02:17:05.253 --> 02:17:12.839]  So they can always use it as an excuse that it didn't happen, let's say, the fall of 2005, but it happened right at election time, as you say.
[02:17:13.300 --> 02:17:17.423]  But the problem is, this damn thing is dangerous, and it also can recombine on its own.
[02:17:17.603 --> 02:17:19.325]  Well, also, Dr. Deagle, thanks for the call.
[02:17:20.399 --> 02:17:23.961]  They can also just say the normal flu could be this.
[02:17:24.121 --> 02:17:25.182]  Oh, we've got quarantine.
[02:17:25.582 --> 02:17:29.505]  Oh, oh, got to get used to martial law and troops ordering you around.
[02:17:30.165 --> 02:17:32.387]  Just all of a sudden, all these reasons for it.
[02:17:32.427 --> 02:17:33.087]  Don't worry.
[02:17:33.107 --> 02:17:34.668]  We're the government.
[02:17:34.728 --> 02:17:36.329]  Never mind we're taking your private property.
[02:17:36.389 --> 02:17:37.790]  In fact, give me that firearm.
[02:17:38.391 --> 02:17:39.111]  Thank you.
[02:17:39.151 --> 02:17:39.672]  Don't worry.
[02:17:39.712 --> 02:17:40.852]  Your government loves you.
[02:17:40.872 --> 02:17:42.053]  We're the authorities.
[02:17:42.493 --> 02:17:44.135]  Shut up, civilians.
[02:17:46.320 --> 02:17:49.121]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[02:17:49.241 --> 02:17:54.304]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[02:17:54.524 --> 02:18:00.706]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[02:18:00.986 --> 02:18:06.609]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[02:18:06.889 --> 02:18:12.394]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[02:18:12.634 --> 02:18:16.478]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[02:18:16.498 --> 02:18:21.782]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[02:18:21.962 --> 02:18:22.783]  Call 877-817-9829.

[02:20:45.344 --> 02:20:47.325]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:20:47.385 --> 02:20:50.267]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:20:50.447 --> 02:20:55.850]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:20:56.070 --> 02:20:57.591]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:20:57.651 --> 02:20:59.892]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:21:00.073 --> 02:21:03.635]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:21:04.155 --> 02:21:04.615]  We're good to go.

[02:21:45.465 --> 02:21:55.310]  And your patient falls in here quickly because there is a mountain of news we haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:21:55.370 --> 02:21:58.832]  But the callers do take us in directions we never go in.
[02:21:59.292 --> 02:22:01.454]  Let's talk to Joe in Wisconsin.
[02:22:01.494 --> 02:22:03.294]  Joe, go ahead, then Rodney and Terry.
[02:22:03.555 --> 02:22:04.015]  Hi, Alex.
[02:22:04.475 --> 02:22:04.815]  Hi.
[02:22:04.835 --> 02:22:06.976]  I heard some real disturbing news yesterday.
[02:22:07.296 --> 02:22:11.537]  I was attending a Muslim evening feast and we were talking about global politics.
[02:22:11.897 --> 02:22:22.879]  And this Malaysian man told me that he heard in Iraq that they had captured some Americans, just like the Brit MI6 with these improvised bombs.
[02:22:23.500 --> 02:22:24.080]  I said, no, no.
[02:22:24.780 --> 02:22:25.980]  Repeat everything you just said.
[02:22:26.060 --> 02:22:26.580]  He says, yeah.
[02:22:27.140 --> 02:22:29.421]  Some Americans were caught, just like the British were.
[02:22:29.801 --> 02:22:33.782]  And they had some Humvees come up, take custody of them and just drive off
[02:22:34.378 --> 02:22:36.259]  And nothing else was said.
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:37.801]  I said, wait a minute.
[02:22:38.481 --> 02:22:40.082]  CNN didn't cover this, did they?
[02:22:40.102 --> 02:22:40.723]  He says, no.
[02:22:41.723 --> 02:22:44.125]  I'm going to be seeing him later on tonight.
[02:22:44.305 --> 02:22:47.748]  But the first thing I thought was, man, Alex has to hear about this.
[02:22:48.168 --> 02:22:49.729]  And I didn't hear you mentioning it.
[02:22:50.481 --> 02:22:52.541]  So, it might be news to you.
[02:22:52.741 --> 02:23:08.605]  I'm going to check... Well, I mean, there's this former Malaysian president who's highly respected by the West and has been seen as a friend in the past, and he's saying it's well known, which we did catch some red-handed, that our own government was carrying out those bombings there, and that's what he's saying.
[02:23:08.645 --> 02:23:15.446]  I mean, they have caught our troops, quote, accidentally shooting and bombing our own people, but it wasn't accidental.
[02:23:16.346 --> 02:23:20.147]  They have caught British dressed up like Arabs attacking...
[02:23:21.242 --> 02:23:42.792]  The other thing I'm worried about is that the administration is using the mass media to anesthetize the American public.
[02:23:43.252 --> 02:23:45.333]  They're just getting war coverage fatigue.
[02:23:45.513 --> 02:23:49.175]  They keep hearing it over and over, and people don't care anymore.
[02:23:49.485 --> 02:23:53.726]  They don't care if it's the worst thing that ever hit planet Earth.
[02:23:53.806 --> 02:23:55.086]  They just don't want to hear it anymore.
[02:23:55.366 --> 02:23:58.367]  I'm concerned about if you repeat something long enough.
[02:23:58.387 --> 02:23:59.347]  Yeah, another five dead today.
[02:23:59.387 --> 02:24:00.507]  Another two dead today.
[02:24:00.707 --> 02:24:01.047]  Oh, yeah.
[02:24:01.828 --> 02:24:14.750]  And the thing I'm worried about is people getting complacent and saying, well, we've heard this all yawn, next issue, next topic, next MTV video or something.
[02:24:14.770 --> 02:24:17.371]  And all I can say is people, they're mad.
[02:24:18.755 --> 02:24:22.858]  You do have an election coming up, and I do believe what you said will come to pass.
[02:24:23.358 --> 02:24:28.962]  And I don't see a whole lot of wiggle room for people that just want to sit on the fence.
[02:24:30.082 --> 02:24:32.504]  You know, you're going to be rounded up just like everybody else.
[02:24:34.125 --> 02:24:35.306]  I appreciate the call.
[02:24:37.227 --> 02:24:42.991]  Throughout history, governments have got total power and control, and they just go crazy and want even more and start...
[02:24:43.769 --> 02:24:47.170]  Attacking their neighbors and arresting their populations.
[02:24:47.230 --> 02:24:50.810]  I mean, this is the nature of these corrupt elites.
[02:24:53.551 --> 02:25:06.233]  And to hear the phony conservative talk show host now saying that it was always about bringing democracy to Iraq, and now we've brought democracy, and the liberals are so angry.
[02:25:06.933 --> 02:25:10.414]  The liberals are outvoting Republicans for most of these wars.
[02:25:11.747 --> 02:25:13.808]  The liberals are owned by the same interests.
[02:25:13.828 --> 02:25:14.849]  There's no difference.
[02:25:15.549 --> 02:25:17.430]  But again, they act like there is.
[02:25:20.872 --> 02:25:26.115]  Every time Bill Clinton comes out and attacks George Bush, Bush's ratings go back up for a few days.
[02:25:26.895 --> 02:25:28.356]  Now there are all-time lows again.
[02:25:28.896 --> 02:25:30.157]  So we're at a crossroads.
[02:25:30.597 --> 02:25:33.979]  Bird flu, terrorist attacks, the economy crashing.
[02:25:36.000 --> 02:25:37.681]  One of these things is going to happen.
[02:25:37.721 --> 02:25:41.043]  I mean, if you think the $5 trillion the Federal Reserve printed...
[02:25:41.701 --> 02:25:43.702]  In the last couple years has been.
[02:25:44.823 --> 02:25:47.505]  Now they're even accelerating that record.
[02:25:48.585 --> 02:25:50.647]  The dollar is going to be like the peso.
[02:25:51.907 --> 02:25:57.711]  And some poor Mexican immigrant, I can talk to them and they know what it means to have a devalued currency.
[02:25:58.251 --> 02:26:00.112]  Oh yes, the dollar is not what it used to be.
[02:26:00.553 --> 02:26:01.813]  Seriously, I talk to these people.
[02:26:02.094 --> 02:26:10.539]  But some yuppie in a Mercedes, they'll just... It's a spirit of giggling, snickering, mindlessness.
[02:26:12.085 --> 02:26:13.786]  That I just can't figure out.
[02:26:13.846 --> 02:26:16.947]  I guess they've never had any trials, never had any tribulations.
[02:26:17.487 --> 02:26:19.468]  Life has been one endless holiday.
[02:26:19.488 --> 02:26:23.230]  And I'm telling you, folks, that's coming to a big, fat, screeching halt.
[02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:25.170]  I mean, I can feel it.
[02:26:25.190 --> 02:26:31.833]  That's why I've kind of got a Chez La Vie, Voyage, have a good trip attitude.
[02:26:32.653 --> 02:26:38.896]  Because all I care about is my family, and that means I care about this country because my family lives here, but
[02:26:40.095 --> 02:26:44.877]  And we've done a good job waking people up, and folks are awake, and the government is discredited, but they don't care.
[02:26:44.937 --> 02:26:50.058]  They just... Because it doesn't matter if George Bush is politically destroyed.
[02:26:50.398 --> 02:26:51.439]  He's a puppet.
[02:26:51.539 --> 02:26:52.599]  He's a tire.
[02:26:52.679 --> 02:26:53.679]  They replace him.
[02:26:54.219 --> 02:26:55.340]  Birdcage liner.
[02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:56.860]  Coffee filter.
[02:26:57.720 --> 02:26:58.501]  Light bulb.
[02:26:59.241 --> 02:27:00.241]  Expendable.
[02:27:00.321 --> 02:27:01.262]  Disposable.
[02:27:03.062 --> 02:27:08.924]  And then he'll take all the blame for this, and he'll be gone, folks, and we'll still be sitting in the middle of martial law.
[02:27:09.665 --> 02:27:11.987]  And you watch, the Democrats are going to love it all of a sudden.
[02:27:12.427 --> 02:27:16.451]  As soon as Bush is out and this whole thing's in place, the Democrats are going to be in control.
[02:27:16.771 --> 02:27:20.874]  Suddenly, that's all going to be fine, and Republicans aren't going to know what to do.
[02:27:20.894 --> 02:27:23.596]  It's just, they play us like a fiddle.
[02:27:25.238 --> 02:27:29.721]  A few more calls, and I'm going to get into some more of the news, but God help us.
[02:27:29.761 --> 02:27:31.483]  I mean, pray for this country.
[02:27:35.986 --> 02:27:36.907]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.368 --> 02:27:38.889]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.864 --> 02:27:42.665]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.127 --> 02:27:53.010]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:27:53.150 --> 02:28:06.076]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:28:06.256 --> 02:28:08.037]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:28:08.217 --> 02:28:08.757]  We're good to go.
[02:28:27.432 --> 02:28:29.294]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[02:30:35.166 --> 02:30:39.948]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:40.228 --> 02:30:42.009]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.426 --> 02:31:03.988]  Hey, John, I just thought of this.
[02:31:04.408 --> 02:31:07.149]  John, right before he went back on air, popped in my ear.
[02:31:07.169 --> 02:31:10.571]  One of the great fellows up there running the show in Minnesota.
[02:31:11.191 --> 02:31:12.372]  I'm down here in Austin, Texas.
[02:31:12.392 --> 02:31:14.793]  He said, have you seen the movie Equilibrium yet?
[02:31:14.813 --> 02:31:15.914]  Which people always tell me about.
[02:31:15.954 --> 02:31:19.536]  It's some police state film set in the near future.
[02:31:19.576 --> 02:31:22.678]  A dystopic novel made into a film.
[02:31:23.598 --> 02:31:28.341]  And he said, yeah, the start of it starts like your martial law video in the 21st century.
[02:31:29.241 --> 02:31:30.782]  Government has become corrupt.
[02:31:31.502 --> 02:31:32.303]  That made me think.
[02:31:32.363 --> 02:31:40.347]  Something I've never done is air the first minute and a half or so, you know, with the British voiceover for Martial Law.
[02:31:40.487 --> 02:31:43.069]  And that'll be the original trailer or the long trailer.
[02:31:43.089 --> 02:31:46.691]  It's in the Martial Law section of InfoWars.com, John.
[02:31:47.171 --> 02:31:50.453]  You go to InfoWars.com and then click on the Martial Law section.
[02:31:50.473 --> 02:31:52.174]  You know, it tells you about the film.
[02:31:52.695 --> 02:31:54.896]  It'll say the original trailer or the long trailer.
[02:31:55.256 --> 02:31:56.537]  Download the high-res...
[02:31:58.124 --> 02:32:04.247]  Thanks a lot.
[02:32:04.947 --> 02:32:06.588]  Since you mentioned that, why not air that?
[02:32:06.608 --> 02:32:08.348]  It's pretty ominous.
[02:32:08.388 --> 02:32:09.349]  I think we did a good job.
[02:32:09.369 --> 02:32:14.211]  Let's take a few final calls, and I've really got to hurry through some other news.
[02:32:14.951 --> 02:32:16.572]  Let's talk to Rodney in Texas.
[02:32:16.592 --> 02:32:17.212]  Go ahead, Rodney.
[02:32:17.552 --> 02:32:19.053]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:32:20.153 --> 02:32:26.536]  Saturday, I was at prisonplanet.com, and I noticed that you had another story that pointed out the glaring...
[02:32:28.027 --> 02:32:42.852]  Weaknesses of this government once again and how they they're really not there to to help the citizens of this country An article was talking about the mayor of Atlanta How she said that none of the FEMA money?
[02:32:42.872 --> 02:32:52.856]  Has been received or been given to help 42,000 victims of Hurricane Katrina and I really appreciate
[02:32:54.266 --> 02:33:01.809]  How you expose these white elephants, you know, that the news media, they try to pretend as though they... Well, here's an example.
[02:33:01.849 --> 02:33:05.191]  Bush says every contract will be given to local companies and citizens.
[02:33:05.651 --> 02:33:08.993]  And almost nothing's been given to people in Louisiana, period.
[02:33:09.033 --> 02:33:10.413]  It's almost all out of state.
[02:33:10.893 --> 02:33:13.134]  So, I mean, just everything they say is a lie.
[02:33:13.415 --> 02:33:13.675]  Right.
[02:33:14.355 --> 02:33:17.336]  And just one other real brief thing I'd like to hear your comments on.
[02:33:17.376 --> 02:33:20.958]  I've just seen another article out of another newspaper talking about...
[02:33:21.718 --> 02:33:24.919]  Well, police and other people in law enforcement said they saw explosions, heard explosions.
[02:33:25.379 --> 02:33:27.099]  There have been reports of these craters.
[02:33:49.878 --> 02:33:54.062]  You know, the Negan runs around saying, the CIA may kill me, and then he shuts up about it.
[02:33:54.563 --> 02:33:56.885]  And look, I don't know what happened there, but I know this.
[02:33:56.965 --> 02:33:59.187]  FEMA cut the communication lines.
[02:33:59.247 --> 02:34:03.191]  They jammed the police radios as the hurricane came in.
[02:34:03.872 --> 02:34:05.974]  They cut police towers.
[02:34:06.654 --> 02:34:08.336]  They wouldn't let food in.
[02:34:09.077 --> 02:34:10.278]  They knew there'd be riots.
[02:34:10.298 --> 02:34:14.162]  They've done social studies on it, sociological studies.
[02:34:14.742 --> 02:34:20.987]  And they wanted those images then to over-report the amount of looting and shooting to then, oh, we need martial law.
[02:34:21.007 --> 02:34:22.328]  See, everything's martial law.
[02:34:22.708 --> 02:34:24.490]  Everything's why we need martial law.
[02:34:25.491 --> 02:34:28.353]  And finally, the gun confiscations.
[02:34:28.853 --> 02:34:29.714]  I haven't heard one word.
[02:34:29.734 --> 02:34:30.575]  Still ongoing.
[02:34:30.615 --> 02:34:31.976]  The federal courts said stop it.
[02:34:32.336 --> 02:34:33.177]  They're still doing it.
[02:34:34.057 --> 02:34:36.819]  So they don't even abide by the rule of law.
[02:34:36.919 --> 02:34:38.180]  It's really pitiful.
[02:34:38.241 --> 02:34:39.582]  We got armored vehicles.
[02:34:39.642 --> 02:34:42.424]  We wear masks and we got machine guns.
[02:34:42.644 --> 02:34:43.865]  And we're going to kill this country.
[02:34:44.922 --> 02:34:46.623]  Bottom line, we're here to kill America.
[02:34:46.903 --> 02:34:47.984]  That's all I got, Alan.
[02:34:48.485 --> 02:34:48.805]  You bet.
[02:34:48.845 --> 02:34:49.585]  Thanks for the call.
[02:34:49.945 --> 02:34:52.467]  Yeah, it's just we're here to kill this country, and we're going to do it.
[02:34:52.807 --> 02:34:53.728]  Now get out of our way.
[02:34:54.809 --> 02:35:02.173]  And I can't believe these guys will follow these orders just to be in their little Darth Vader outfits and to make $40,000 a year.
[02:35:02.574 --> 02:35:03.894]  They'll do anything they're told.
[02:35:05.515 --> 02:35:07.337]  And I just can't understand it, folks.
[02:35:07.437 --> 02:35:13.981]  I mean, frankly, people call it a weakness that I will not... If something doesn't totally agree with my morals...
[02:35:14.717 --> 02:35:17.539]  I will not, you know, no amount of money will buy me.
[02:35:18.259 --> 02:35:19.620]  And that scene is unusual.
[02:35:19.900 --> 02:35:22.522]  That's been the norm throughout Western civilization.
[02:35:23.183 --> 02:35:27.545]  It was the few, the pathetic, who were buyable.
[02:35:29.386 --> 02:35:33.829]  I mean, people all make excuses to themselves.
[02:35:34.450 --> 02:35:35.911]  You're a bunch of whores, okay?
[02:35:36.811 --> 02:35:37.592]  And I'm tired of it.
[02:35:39.033 --> 02:35:39.153]  And...
[02:35:41.898 --> 02:35:43.480]  I just have trouble dealing with it.
[02:35:43.861 --> 02:35:44.922]  Terry in Texas.
[02:35:44.962 --> 02:35:45.523]  Last caller.
[02:35:45.543 --> 02:35:46.144]  Go ahead, Terry.
[02:35:47.185 --> 02:35:47.646]  Hi.
[02:35:48.026 --> 02:35:55.957]  I just feel like we just can't give up all the little firefighters that we have to fight, too, at the same time.
[02:35:55.997 --> 02:36:00.002]  Like that bumper sticker, think globally, act locally.
[02:36:00.580 --> 02:36:26.757]  And if every Texan who's listening to you today would go to TexasTollParty.com and read a letter that for one little click of a button you can send a letter to your governor and your legislators and tell them you do not want them taking a half a million acres of farmland away from these farmers to build a toll road that a Spanish company is going to make a killing off of and how they're going to put the toll roads all over Texas.
[02:36:26.857 --> 02:36:28.958]  But King Juan Carlos needs money.
[02:36:29.761 --> 02:36:31.563]  TexasTollParty.com.
[02:36:31.603 --> 02:36:46.258]  You can go add your little postscript and you can send them a letter because there are about 53 legislators in Texas who are against this toll road and they're against the corridor and for the time it takes to watch an advertisement
[02:36:46.826 --> 02:36:48.427]  You can go to some of these websites.
[02:36:48.487 --> 02:36:55.592]  But so what if we can stop being taxed and tracked and ticketed with transponders and all of our inspection stickers?
[02:36:55.932 --> 02:36:56.673]  It's very scary.
[02:36:56.693 --> 02:36:57.533]  That doesn't matter.
[02:36:57.593 --> 02:36:59.334]  What matters is the UT horns.
[02:36:59.835 --> 02:37:05.439]  But we can vote on November 8th, and we can vote against that Proposition 1 and 9.
[02:37:05.979 --> 02:37:06.459]  You're right.
[02:37:06.519 --> 02:37:08.661]  I can go vote on Hart Intercivic Machines.
[02:37:09.661 --> 02:37:10.502]  That's another thing.
[02:37:10.542 --> 02:37:12.243]  We've got to work for the paper ballots.
[02:37:12.283 --> 02:37:13.064]  We can fight...
[02:37:13.755 --> 02:37:17.598]  These fires, we have to fight these fires locally as well.
[02:37:17.638 --> 02:37:22.742]  We have to, like, go to meetings and find out more about how can we get paper ballots.
[02:37:22.782 --> 02:37:24.023]  Hey, I totally agree with you.
[02:37:24.123 --> 02:37:25.283]  Thanks for the call, Terry.
[02:37:25.744 --> 02:37:28.706]  But so-called men aren't supposed to do that.
[02:37:29.406 --> 02:37:35.471]  Men are supposed to wallow around drinking beer and watching television while their kid smokes dope in the backyard.
[02:37:36.221 --> 02:37:39.103]  Men are just supposed to swagger around acting tough.
[02:37:39.404 --> 02:37:42.966]  A man isn't supposed to actually defend their family or their children's future.
[02:37:43.487 --> 02:37:49.271]  A man is supposed to swagger around with a George Bush sticker or a Bill Clinton sticker on his car.
[02:37:49.892 --> 02:37:55.536]  And women are supposed to be out at the bar with their girlfriends giggling and acting like idiots.
[02:37:57.518 --> 02:38:05.264]  Or, you know, fretting about wrinkles at the corners of their eyes and getting the latest collagen injections from dead Chinese slaves.
[02:38:06.724 --> 02:38:08.565]  Well, so what if they're dead Chinese slaves?
[02:38:08.665 --> 02:38:09.786]  I need my looks.
[02:38:11.927 --> 02:38:13.747]  Yeah, we do put out little fires.
[02:38:13.828 --> 02:38:22.332]  We had Vicky Carpong yesterday talking about the election fraud and the industrialized CIA control of our elections.
[02:38:23.812 --> 02:38:26.214]  And I constantly talk about the toll roads.
[02:38:27.914 --> 02:38:32.957]  I would tell you, get your phone book out and actually call the legislators yourself.
[02:38:34.901 --> 02:38:38.423]  I would say, actually, go to their local office in your town.
[02:38:40.584 --> 02:38:44.006]  But believe me, Terry, they know you don't want it.
[02:38:44.026 --> 02:38:46.427]  Houston poll, 98%.
[02:38:46.567 --> 02:38:47.088]  Austin poll, 93%.
[02:38:47.128 --> 02:38:53.191]  And now that people in Austin have learned more, the last poll was, what, 95%.
[02:38:54.592 --> 02:38:55.852]  We have good people in government.
[02:38:56.433 --> 02:39:04.397]  TxDOT employees leaked the documents to Marissa McCracken, a city council member, and it was marked classified.
[02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:10.205]  TaxDot, hmm, classified, that they have more money than they need.
[02:39:12.989 --> 02:39:15.351]  That they do not have a shortfall in highway funds.
[02:39:16.112 --> 02:39:16.773]  Well, no kidding.
[02:39:17.334 --> 02:39:18.796]  Oil use is up at record levels.
[02:39:18.836 --> 02:39:20.097]  The taxes are at record levels.
[02:39:20.357 --> 02:39:25.023]  When you hear this boulder dash about how there's no money for stuff, folks, government sits around and laughs.
[02:39:25.043 --> 02:39:25.864]  They've got an old trick.
[02:39:27.788 --> 02:39:43.176]  They won't fill potholes, they won't put new radios in police cars until everything else is paid for, and they've made select government investments in stocks and bonds, and they've bought themselves all new luxury Cadillacs for the politicians or escalades to drive around in.
[02:39:45.117 --> 02:39:45.537]  Literally.
[02:39:46.177 --> 02:39:49.039]  I mean, lowly bureaucrats drive around in $50,000 vehicles.
[02:39:53.381 --> 02:39:57.083]  And then they come along and they make some cuts.
[02:39:59.352 --> 02:40:04.474]  A few poultry cuts that don't even fit into the bigger picture, and they go, oh, see, we've got to have tax increases.
[02:40:06.835 --> 02:40:18.679]  And so the people do not want a transponder in their inspection sticker, and they do not want to be taxed as you drive down existing main roads, and they do not want to be ticketed from transponder reader to transponder reader.
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:21.300]  You think TxDOT and Department of Public Safety cares?
[02:40:21.741 --> 02:40:27.983]  Five years ago they had the radio readers up in San Antonio, Dallas, and Houston, and they're putting them up in Austin right now.
[02:40:29.568 --> 02:40:31.970]  They're building it, and they don't care if none of you want it.
[02:40:31.990 --> 02:40:33.491]  They don't care if there's plenty of money.
[02:40:33.711 --> 02:40:35.031]  They got machine guns!
[02:40:35.312 --> 02:40:35.932]  You understand?
[02:40:35.952 --> 02:40:45.818]  They'll stick a gun in your mouth, and they'll cock it to say, I'm going to take you to jail if you don't carry this little inspection sticker, and you don't pay Juan Carlos.
[02:40:46.198 --> 02:40:48.280]  King Juan Carlos!
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:53.744]  It's true is the company that he owns, the company that's going to tax you.
[02:40:53.764 --> 02:41:01.812]  A king, a king, let me say it again, a king is going to be taxing you.
[02:41:01.932 --> 02:41:03.954]  I hope you enjoy it.
[02:41:05.135 --> 02:41:13.082]  Because that son of a bitch, and excuse me using that French, but it's true, that son of the devil is...
[02:41:14.281 --> 02:41:15.001]  I'm getting a little upset.
[02:41:15.021 --> 02:41:16.922]  I apologize for that light French.
[02:41:16.982 --> 02:41:18.382]  But he is a piece of trash.
[02:41:18.462 --> 02:41:20.503]  That inbred maggot.
[02:41:20.783 --> 02:41:21.563]  How's that, okay?
[02:41:24.024 --> 02:41:28.366]  He came to this state and paid off our politicians openly.
[02:41:28.526 --> 02:41:28.846]  Openly.
[02:41:28.866 --> 02:41:29.806]  A foreign corporation.
[02:41:30.226 --> 02:41:30.586]  Openly.
[02:41:30.606 --> 02:41:31.767]  And it's also a consortium.
[02:41:31.787 --> 02:41:32.947]  There's some German money involved.
[02:41:34.227 --> 02:41:36.548]  They came to this state and they paid our people off.
[02:41:36.668 --> 02:41:38.589]  They've been doing it for a decade and they own them now.
[02:41:38.689 --> 02:41:39.349]  And you know what?
[02:41:39.389 --> 02:41:41.910]  He's going to own our roads and you're going to pay him.
[02:41:44.284 --> 02:41:52.287]  Over half the money, the four-plus thousand a year you're going to be paying locally and in the state, half that money is going to go into that piece of trash's pocket.
[02:41:53.708 --> 02:42:00.591]  Now, you want to live in a New World Order, folks, you're going to get to live in one where you pay direct taxes to the king of Spain.
[02:42:02.672 --> 02:42:03.332]  Ha, ha, ha!
[02:42:03.592 --> 02:42:07.954]  And you tell one of these snot-nosed yuppies that, they'll giggle and drool at you.
[02:42:07.974 --> 02:42:12.236]  Because let me tell you something, deep down, they're the biggest cowards you've ever seen in your life.
[02:42:12.256 --> 02:42:13.336]  Let me tell you what a yuppie does.
[02:42:13.979 --> 02:42:16.500]  And I mean a nouveau riche neocon yuppie.
[02:42:18.360 --> 02:42:21.601]  They make split-second decisions to accept everything.
[02:42:22.401 --> 02:42:27.722]  If they look at a threat that looks like they can't deal with it, they'll automatically mentally decide to join it.
[02:42:28.963 --> 02:42:32.903]  I guess even if a bus is coming toward them about to run them over, they won't try to jump out of the way.
[02:42:32.923 --> 02:42:35.004]  They'll just say, well, I'm a hood ornament.
[02:42:35.744 --> 02:42:36.224]  Bam!
[02:42:38.305 --> 02:42:39.665]  I mean, they literally, I've seen them.
[02:42:40.185 --> 02:42:41.806]  They'll deny something when it's proven to them.
[02:42:41.826 --> 02:42:43.486]  They'll go, okay, I accept it, so what?
[02:42:44.176 --> 02:42:45.437]  I only care about myself.
[02:42:45.638 --> 02:42:46.439]  You're an idiot.
[02:42:46.599 --> 02:42:48.421]  And they'll laugh at those of us that care.
[02:42:48.721 --> 02:42:49.722]  Like we're weak.
[02:42:50.062 --> 02:42:51.324]  Like we're stupid.
[02:42:52.205 --> 02:42:55.508]  Hey, parasite, everything you've got is because of people like us.
[02:42:56.189 --> 02:42:58.371]  People a lot better than us that came before us.
[02:42:58.932 --> 02:43:03.937]  You're living off the work of people that came before you, you little idiot.
[02:43:04.878 --> 02:43:05.318]  And I mean it.
[02:43:05.358 --> 02:43:06.700]  You really are the scum of the earth.
[02:43:09.261 --> 02:43:13.525]  And so they hear this stuff, and their whole world is about making split-second decisions.
[02:43:13.565 --> 02:43:15.427]  Their whole world is about laughing at it.
[02:43:15.807 --> 02:43:17.989]  Their whole world is about giggling about it.
[02:43:18.369 --> 02:43:21.112]  Their whole world is about making a big joke out of it.
[02:43:23.274 --> 02:43:25.516]  You see, if they're faced with something, they just make a joke about it.
[02:43:27.137 --> 02:43:31.421]  And then supposedly that gives them power over it mentally, and they think everything's okay.
[02:43:32.987 --> 02:43:33.987]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:43:34.007 --> 02:43:40.009]  God forbid your child, when they're 10 years old, you find out they've got a leukemia, which is up thousands of percentiles.
[02:43:40.710 --> 02:43:47.772]  Cancer on average is up 500% in the last 20 years, but childhood leukemias are just up by several thousand percentage points, depending on the leukemia.
[02:43:48.132 --> 02:43:50.013]  And it's directly linked to the stuff in the vaccines.
[02:43:50.273 --> 02:43:57.976]  And when that baby sitting there died, and you're wrenching your yuppie guts out, you remember I warned you, you stupid idiots!
[02:44:00.677 --> 02:44:01.557]  It isn't funny!
[02:44:02.276 --> 02:44:08.101]  The wages of sin or death, being a giggly-eyed idiot, doesn't get you ahead in life.
[02:44:08.301 --> 02:44:11.443]  You need to be knocked upside the head, you fools!
[02:44:12.885 --> 02:44:17.148]  We're dealing with psychopathic killers that are now running this country.
[02:44:17.348 --> 02:44:22.853]  They're a bunch of social engineers who get off on doing bad things to us, and I'm sick of it!
[02:44:23.453 --> 02:44:25.995]  I got so much proof it's coming out my ears.
[02:44:26.335 --> 02:44:27.476]  I'm sick of proving it.
[02:44:27.596 --> 02:44:29.498]  There's nothing else to prove, people!
[02:44:33.559 --> 02:44:35.060]  Alright, I just am so sick of it.
[02:44:36.961 --> 02:44:39.502]  And she brings that point up and it just makes me go livid.
[02:44:41.723 --> 02:44:43.163]  I think I suppress things like that.
[02:44:43.203 --> 02:44:46.425]  I remember two years ago learning who owned this toll company.
[02:44:47.665 --> 02:44:57.810]  And I learned it was a European consortium and then I typed it into Google and I went and I learned that the majority owner is the Royal House of Spain and Juan Carlos!
[02:45:00.291 --> 02:45:02.272]  I mean, this has got to make you sick.
[02:45:03.866 --> 02:45:04.987]  You know who owns BP?
[02:45:05.027 --> 02:45:05.667]  Queen of England.
[02:45:06.448 --> 02:45:07.048]  Biggest owner.
[02:45:07.328 --> 02:45:08.749]  You know who owns Dutch Roll Shell?
[02:45:09.109 --> 02:45:09.970]  Dutch Roll Family.
[02:45:10.390 --> 02:45:11.731]  I'm sick of these people.
[02:45:12.603 --> 02:45:15.764]  And I'm sick of them saying they want to kill me and my family.
[02:45:16.224 --> 02:45:18.564]  They actually write books saying they want to kill us.
[02:45:18.885 --> 02:45:20.825]  And you sit there and giggle about it?
[02:45:21.145 --> 02:45:37.189]  We're talking about powerful people that say they want to kill you, and now they've engineered this flu, and they're scaremongering us, and they're running around saying, give all your rights up when the flu comes, the troops are going to keep you safe, and the flu's coming from the very people that engineered it.
[02:45:42.452 --> 02:45:45.334]  I mean, face it, we're living in insanity.
[02:45:48.796 --> 02:45:52.479]  We ought to all rip our clothes off and put on sackcloth.
[02:45:52.859 --> 02:45:54.160]  What's the point of putting sackcloth on?
[02:45:54.220 --> 02:45:55.481]  It's horrible, scratchy cloth.
[02:45:55.501 --> 02:46:05.608]  It's to make you think about what you're in, to make you think about what you've done, to make you constantly think about the uncomfortable position you've put the entire tribe in, the entire society in.
[02:46:08.294 --> 02:46:17.423]  Again, folks, you can yell and scream about the football team and get upset and paint your face up and wear monster outfits and act like complete fools, and that's normal.
[02:46:17.904 --> 02:46:31.097]  I get upset about the fact that I'm going to have to pay thousands of dollars to a foreign royalty, inbred Hitler-supporting royalty, and some stupid cop
[02:46:32.034 --> 02:46:36.616]  Will take me to jail under felony charges if I take or disable that transponder.
[02:46:36.816 --> 02:46:38.076]  That was in the bill we just beat.
[02:46:38.976 --> 02:46:47.799]  And that dumb as dirt cop is going to take me to jail and feel good about it because I disabled the transponder and that's how he gets his paycheck paid.
[02:46:48.119 --> 02:46:52.821]  When you got... A caller earlier wanted me to talk about the comprehensive annual financial report.
[02:46:55.792 --> 02:46:59.593]  And simply put, the government has two sets of books, and it's totally public.
[02:46:59.993 --> 02:47:01.214]  All the big investors get it.
[02:47:01.234 --> 02:47:02.154]  The mutual funds get it.
[02:47:02.414 --> 02:47:03.475]  The big newspapers get it.
[02:47:03.515 --> 02:47:04.695]  It's a big inside joke.
[02:47:04.715 --> 02:47:10.697]  I mean, go talk to the local editor of your big newspaper at a dinner party, and they'll, I'm not going to talk about that.
[02:47:10.757 --> 02:47:11.497]  How do you know about that?
[02:47:11.877 --> 02:47:13.778]  See, it's all for the insiders to know.
[02:47:14.718 --> 02:47:19.200]  And the government takes over half the money that comes in and has been investing it for 50-plus years.
[02:47:21.509 --> 02:47:24.251]  And they got so much money, it's insane.
[02:47:24.291 --> 02:47:32.017]  Over 70% of the stock market is government investments, and the corporations have merged with the government, and we're all slaves.
[02:47:33.798 --> 02:47:36.060]  And now they're putting a grid in to control us.
[02:47:36.100 --> 02:47:41.683]  All these cameras, all these militarized police are to... It isn't enough for them.
[02:47:42.764 --> 02:47:43.585]  There's never enough.
[02:47:45.846 --> 02:47:46.507]  They want it all.
[02:47:47.322 --> 02:47:53.964]  And so they're going to squeeze old ladies for double coal oil or fuel oil prices this winter for no reason.
[02:47:54.785 --> 02:47:55.765]  There's never enough for them.
[02:47:55.785 --> 02:48:00.667]  They're going to take people's property and then just give it to a developer to build on it.
[02:48:00.747 --> 02:48:02.087]  They're going to destroy it.
[02:48:02.307 --> 02:48:03.568]  It's what they've always done.
[02:48:04.608 --> 02:48:14.732]  That's the nature of the elite, is they're a bunch of inbred, trashy people who have no love of the species, who just revel.
[02:48:15.453 --> 02:48:17.173]  In destroying everything good and decent.
[02:48:17.934 --> 02:48:19.354]  I'll hit one or two stories and we'll get back.
[02:48:19.374 --> 02:48:24.155]  In this transmission, you believe in what we're doing.
[02:48:24.195 --> 02:48:33.497]  You need to get Road to Tyranny and the Masters of Terror and all my films and make copies so at least when these guys take over, more people will know who we're dealing with.
[02:48:33.517 --> 02:48:35.398]  Look, we haven't even begun to fight.
[02:48:35.718 --> 02:48:36.618]  We're never giving up.
[02:48:37.318 --> 02:48:38.098]  And we're going to win.
[02:48:39.078 --> 02:48:41.879]  And the New World Order is going to pay.
[02:48:48.277 --> 02:48:49.418]  And who stands to gain?
[02:48:50.078 --> 02:48:51.378]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:48:51.578 --> 02:48:57.321]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:57.581 --> 02:49:02.863]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:49:03.143 --> 02:49:03.623]  Brace yourself.
[02:49:03.643 --> 02:49:04.804]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:49:42.573 --> 02:49:44.635]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:49:45.521 --> 02:49:53.787]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:54.028 --> 02:49:58.391]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:58.691 --> 02:50:07.598]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:07.818 --> 02:50:11.441]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:11.721 --> 02:50:16.750]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:17.030 --> 02:50:23.742]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:50:24.255 --> 02:50:24.895]  What about you?

[02:51:23.384 --> 02:51:23.664]  I think?
[02:51:46.332 --> 02:51:49.074]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:49.094 --> 02:51:52.978]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.940 --> 02:51:56.500]  Think about it.
[02:51:56.901 --> 02:52:00.023]  Close to 100% of Texans don't want the toll roads.
[02:52:02.165 --> 02:52:03.166]  They're totally criminal.
[02:52:03.226 --> 02:52:04.147]  They have plenty of money.
[02:52:04.187 --> 02:52:05.127]  We have their own documents.
[02:52:06.188 --> 02:52:09.671]  And Juan Carlos, the king of Spain, gets most of the money.
[02:52:09.971 --> 02:52:10.792]  But that's okay.
[02:52:10.972 --> 02:52:13.054]  See, that's globalism, people.
[02:52:13.534 --> 02:52:15.536]  Here's the intro to my film, Martial Law.
[02:52:16.365 --> 02:52:17.306]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:52:18.666 --> 02:52:27.131]  In the early years of the 21st century, terrorism was used by governments across the world as a pretext to scare their populations into submission.
[02:52:31.273 --> 02:52:38.397]  Life became a surveillance grid nightmare, with every individual's actions ruthlessly catalogued and recorded by the state.
[02:52:40.238 --> 02:52:44.260]  Secret arrests, checkpoints, and warrantless searches spread.
[02:52:46.365 --> 02:52:53.487]  The final incremental march of the police state culminating in open martial law.
[02:52:53.667 --> 02:53:05.389]  This is the story of how the elite sold their people into slavery and scared the once proud and brave people of the West into submitting to being cannon fodder in wars of world domination.
[02:53:10.790 --> 02:53:12.811]  Our enemies have made clear
[02:53:13.960 --> 02:53:19.684]  All right.
[02:53:20.284 --> 02:53:24.387]  That's the little four-minute intro to the film, and that's downloaded off the web.
[02:53:24.427 --> 02:53:25.988]  It's even better quality on DVD.
[02:53:26.828 --> 02:53:27.609]  But I hope you'll get it.
[02:53:27.629 --> 02:53:30.371]  It's a miniseries, three films in one, $25.95.
[02:53:31.552 --> 02:53:33.833]  And martial law needs to be seen.
[02:53:33.873 --> 02:53:35.434]  It's my best work, folks.
[02:53:35.494 --> 02:53:38.596]  If you haven't gotten it, it's on VHS and DVD.
[02:53:38.656 --> 02:53:39.457]  You need to have it.
[02:53:39.477 --> 02:53:41.378]  You need to get it out to people.
[02:53:42.114 --> 02:53:46.638]  And if you want to support us, and people are always asking how they support us, buy five, ten copies of the video.
[02:54:11.050 --> 02:54:12.590]  And consider that to be a donation.
[02:54:13.071 --> 02:54:15.011]  I don't want just straight-up donations.
[02:54:15.051 --> 02:54:20.553]  I'd rather you just get a bunch of the videos and give those to people, and then we know that money is going to good.
[02:54:21.593 --> 02:54:25.054]  So please, you can write to me at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:54:29.306 --> 02:54:32.811]  Or you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a 15-cent-a-day membership.
