[00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:06.579]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.219 --> 00:00:08.299]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:10.099]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:11.580]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.220]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.561]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:22.142]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.005 --> 00:00:44.970]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen, to this Tuesday live edition, the 24th day of May 2005.
[00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.371]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.772 --> 00:00:50.393]  We have him on a couple times a year.
[00:00:50.473 --> 00:00:55.755]  He's just an incredible mind when it comes to the New World Order and the global slave state.
[00:00:56.396 --> 00:00:58.357]  He, of course, is a doctor.
[00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:03.682]  And at the same time, an expert on the New World Order and an author, he's Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[00:01:04.703 --> 00:01:07.686]  And he'll be coming on in the next hour.
[00:01:07.746 --> 00:01:24.242]  He'll be joining us to talk about, well, Reuters coming out and saying that, oh, we need to get rid of our borders, Pan American Union, the CFR says so, and Bush ordering the Border Patrol to stand down, and the free trade area of the Americas, and how it ties into CAFTA and NAFTA.
[00:01:24.924 --> 00:01:36.133]  And basically, what your world government's going to look like, why have the Bilderberg Group basically gone public with their desire for world government, why is CNN happily reporting it, why are we seeing these major shifts?
[00:01:37.754 --> 00:01:41.457]  That is coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:41.497 --> 00:01:48.942]  The websites, freshly updated daily for you, are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:53.558]  Volcano erupts in Mexico.
[00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.540]  A lot of volcanic activity and tectonic activity.
[00:01:57.061 --> 00:01:57.941]  I don't have to tell you that.
[00:01:58.001 --> 00:01:58.482]  You know it.
[00:01:59.362 --> 00:02:03.245]  A volcano erupted in western Mexico, spewing hot ash and lava.
[00:02:03.265 --> 00:02:06.387]  The largest eruption for the cone in six years.
[00:02:06.407 --> 00:02:08.288]  More details coming up in the next segment.
[00:02:09.008 --> 00:02:12.010]  Deadly car bomb explodes near Iraqi school.
[00:02:12.671 --> 00:02:13.371]  Seven U.S.
[00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:16.193]  troops killed in two separate bombings in the last day.
[00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:21.114]  Black market organ trade is Baghdad's new growth industry.
[00:02:21.575 --> 00:02:24.477]  They're taking people's organs at some of these death camps as well.
[00:02:24.517 --> 00:02:26.279]  That's been in the foreign press.
[00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:30.422]  Big brother to dictate what you can and cannot photograph.
[00:02:30.923 --> 00:02:33.045]  This is out of the Christian Science Monitor.
[00:02:33.285 --> 00:02:40.271]  Uzbek activist says he saw 500 dead bodies after that Tiananmen Square-style massacre.
[00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:44.535]  Pilot who flew over Washington feared he would be shot down.
[00:02:46.363 --> 00:02:53.011]  As well as futurists saying that the elite will be able to download their minds and gain immortality.
[00:02:54.292 --> 00:02:58.156]  I don't buy that form of supposed life extension.
[00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:02.481]  But who knows the way technology is advancing.
[00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:07.607]  At least they might claim these are sentient human minds recorded.
[00:03:09.617 --> 00:03:15.339]  And we'll also get into secret North Korea footage suggests nascent descent.
[00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:17.660]  This is out of the South Florida Sun Sentinel.
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:18.580]  Very interesting.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.801]  Syria stops cooperating with U.S.
[00:03:20.861 --> 00:03:22.681]  forces and the CIA.
[00:03:23.481 --> 00:03:25.902]  Big Brother snitch signs introduced in England.
[00:03:26.382 --> 00:03:31.564]  Japan's coming out with all sorts of new Big Brother systems, making you swipe your ID card.
[00:03:32.284 --> 00:03:34.545]  Bank security breach, maybe the biggest yet.
[00:03:34.605 --> 00:03:35.505]  Bank of America, 676,000.
[00:03:38.843 --> 00:03:41.506]  Personal IDs and information stolen.
[00:03:41.526 --> 00:03:58.184]  And I have an article here where the feds admit that they're allowing corporations to use social security numbers, that becoming the fiat national ID card, the de facto national ID card, I should say.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.860]  Has actually spread ID theft problems.
[00:04:01.901 --> 00:04:11.682]  Yes, that's one of the greatest engines driving it, and companies selling your personal data, which Bank of America did to a fake company.
[00:04:12.783 --> 00:04:24.165]  So it isn't more security that's needed, it's these companies need to stop sharing data with hundreds of federal and state databases, and any company that comes along wanting to buy that data.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.644]  By the way, I have never and I will never sell any of the names of people that have bought my films.
[00:04:31.264 --> 00:04:36.228]  Though I've been offered quite a lot of money to do it, I have refused.
[00:04:36.388 --> 00:04:38.490]  So we don't engage in that.
[00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:40.791]  But the globalists do.
[00:04:40.811 --> 00:04:44.074]  Doesn't matter if you pay with a check or credit card.
[00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:47.436]  One of these big companies, they're just selling that data.
[00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:51.459]  The feds are paying the states to expand this net.
[00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:54.181]  They're buying it from the stores and companies.
[00:04:55.402 --> 00:04:57.103]  We'll talk about identity theft as well.
[00:04:57.163 --> 00:04:57.904]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:57.924 --> 00:04:58.364]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.406 --> 00:05:05.748]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.928 --> 00:05:10.371]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.511 --> 00:05:14.874]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.914 --> 00:05:16.255]  The New World Order.
[00:05:18.055 --> 00:05:22.276]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.336 --> 00:05:29.278]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.398 --> 00:05:31.478]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.758 --> 00:05:42.101]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.121 --> 00:05:42.821]  If you want

[00:06:07.383 --> 00:06:13.587]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?

[00:07:00.447 --> 00:07:03.828]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:07:04.068 --> 00:07:04.408]  Why?
[00:07:04.748 --> 00:07:07.368]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:07:07.448 --> 00:07:12.389]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[00:08:05.918 --> 00:08:06.558]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.238 --> 00:08:08.298]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.999 --> 00:08:10.099]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.739 --> 00:08:11.580]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.240]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.542]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.062 --> 00:08:22.163]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.467 --> 00:08:35.609]  All right, second segment, 8 minutes, 30 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:35.669 --> 00:08:42.132]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy will be joining us to give us the latest developments concerning the construction of this world government.
[00:08:43.233 --> 00:08:46.354]  Now so far along, they don't even deny its existence.
[00:08:46.394 --> 00:08:48.255]  They just try to spin it and tell you how good it is.
[00:08:49.471 --> 00:08:54.296]  In the meantime, we'll be taking your calls and covering a cornucopia of important news.
[00:08:54.356 --> 00:08:56.118]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:56.138 --> 00:08:56.778]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:56.818 --> 00:08:58.099]  And we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:08:58.119 --> 00:09:01.022]  Interesting articles coming out about the Patriot Act.
[00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:01.983]  FBI powers may become fearsome.
[00:09:15.054 --> 00:09:28.197]  This out-of-the-sun herald, and I've got a big stack of editorials by conservatives, liberals, freedom lovers, who are actually now reading what is in this attempted expansion of the Patriot Act.
[00:09:28.257 --> 00:09:34.679]  Secret arrests, secret executions, no due process, no warrants.
[00:09:34.939 --> 00:09:38.100]  It is extremely widespread.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.661]  And the feds are out saying, why, with the Missouri case...
[00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:47.196]  With the woman who went and murdered the other woman and cut the baby out of her.
[00:09:47.216 --> 00:09:48.798]  Remember that a few months ago?
[00:09:49.298 --> 00:09:53.202]  Why, we use the Patriot Act, and that's what saved the baby!
[00:09:54.972 --> 00:10:02.654]  Well, no, actually neighbors were able to pick out the identification of the car and direct police there.
[00:10:03.294 --> 00:10:19.217]  And at the very same time, they were able to use internet records that had been communicated via email to the woman who was murdered by the killer, the admitted killer, claiming she was wanting to come over and buy a Chihuahua.
[00:10:21.545 --> 00:10:25.667]  Now, the police can always get a warrant instantly.
[00:10:26.968 --> 00:10:28.649]  That's total probable cause.
[00:10:28.689 --> 00:10:29.950]  I mean, this woman's been butchered.
[00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.891]  They want to check her email.
[00:10:32.711 --> 00:10:38.875]  And they wouldn't even need a warrant with that, quite frankly, because that is hot pursuit.
[00:10:38.915 --> 00:10:43.297]  And I've looked at the federal and state rulings and common law.
[00:10:43.397 --> 00:10:49.701]  I mean, if the police are driving down the road and they see a hand sticking out of a trunk, they don't need a warrant either.
[00:10:51.095 --> 00:11:02.305]  But nevertheless, they could instantly get a warrant, and the ISPs, without even being asked, were giving the information up to get the trace route to where the email originated.
[00:11:03.406 --> 00:11:05.527]  And so it's more deception.
[00:11:06.388 --> 00:11:09.291]  And so they're saying, see, it saved the baby.
[00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:14.115]  Section 202 of the First Patriot Act.
[00:11:15.038 --> 00:11:20.644]  Where we don't need a warrant to get data off of computer systems or files.
[00:11:20.784 --> 00:11:22.426]  This was instrumental.
[00:11:23.727 --> 00:11:29.954]  And there are several news articles analyzing this and pointing out that it is a complete and total fraud.
[00:11:30.535 --> 00:11:35.380]  You go to a house and somebody's had their stomach and uterus cut open.
[00:11:36.385 --> 00:11:39.447]  There's blood all over the place.
[00:11:40.268 --> 00:11:47.073]  The police can instantly go get records and instantly start checking where the information came from.
[00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:52.511]  No, what the Patriot Act does is it just says nobody's records are secret.
[00:11:52.911 --> 00:12:09.635]  Hell, no, giant snooping systems can be hooked directly into the Internet, hooked directly into the phone lines, which have already been there for decades with the phone lines, but now they want to be able to use them en masse, that is publicly, because it's always been illegal, but they continue to do it.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:18.624]  So, they've never blocked the FBI or police when they're involved in a real investigation with real evidence of stuff going on.
[00:12:19.084 --> 00:12:22.546]  All this is is giant snooping operations.
[00:12:22.586 --> 00:12:26.468]  So, very, very deceptive as usual.
[00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:35.253]  And this is an article, I can't read the whole thing because of time constraints, but FBI's powers may become fearsome, Sun Herald reports.
[00:12:36.078 --> 00:12:36.799]  We're good to go.
[00:12:59.984 --> 00:13:09.771]  ...is an unfettered national police force with the sole discretion to determine who can be investigated as a potential terrorist, or arrested for that matter.
[00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:31.614]  That's the impact of little-known provisions to be greatly expanding the powers of the FBI, permitting its agents to seize business records without a warrant, and to track the mail of those in terrorist inquiries without regard to Postal Service concerns, because the government can label almost any group or individual a terrorist threat.
[00:13:32.014 --> 00:13:34.395]  That's in Section 802, the job paper.
[00:13:34.915 --> 00:13:45.901]  The potential for abuse by not having to show probable cause is enormous, prompting civil libertarians to correctly speculate about who will guard against the guardians.
[00:13:46.341 --> 00:13:56.967]  Up until now, the answer has been the Constitution as interpreted by the judiciary, but it is clear that sidestepping any such restriction in the real and present danger of the post-9-11 era.
[00:13:58.743 --> 00:14:06.026]  And Bob Barr has said that the government is a greater threat than, quote, the terrorists if they were even real and weren't L-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:14:08.927 --> 00:14:13.869]  And are you more worried about ragtag terrorists if they even existed outside the government?
[00:14:14.410 --> 00:14:19.632]  Or are you more worried about a centralized, monolithic, old, powerful, imperial state?
[00:14:21.872 --> 00:14:41.549]  A wise man, the late Senator John Williams of Delaware, once counseled that any proposed legislation should be regarded in the light of its worst potential consequences, because that's always its consequence, particularly when it came to laws that enhance the investigative and prosecutorial powers of the government at the expense of civil rights.
[00:14:41.669 --> 00:14:45.172]  This is most likely to occur in times of national stress,
[00:14:45.692 --> 00:14:49.313]  When the Constitution is always vulnerable to assault, i.e.
[00:14:49.413 --> 00:14:52.613]  the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II.
[00:14:53.094 --> 00:14:54.034]  Think it can't happen?
[00:14:54.514 --> 00:14:56.274]  Well, it does all the time.
[00:14:57.134 --> 00:15:04.396]  Ask the lawyer in Oregon who the FBI misidentified as having taken part in the terrorist bombing of the Spanish Railway.
[00:15:05.016 --> 00:15:11.917]  Ask any number of persons since 9-11 arrested and detained for months without charges or counsel before they were released.
[00:15:12.637 --> 00:15:15.118]  If this isn't enough to satisfy you about the
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.861]  Indivisibility of these proposals.
[00:15:19.241 --> 00:15:37.815]  Think back to the Cold War days when the most casual acquaintance with a group or person on J. Edgar Hoover's anti-communist watch list could land one in water hot enough to make life miserable for a long time, maybe even put him or her in one of the infamous black lists.
[00:15:39.036 --> 00:15:40.617]  And the article goes on and on.
[00:15:41.558 --> 00:15:44.200]  And this is the tip of the iceberg, my friends.
[00:15:46.158 --> 00:16:00.890]  I have the Christian Science Monitor here in front of me, where the feds and state police and others say openly, well, there's no law that you can't videotape or photograph anything on the street, but we're arresting people en masse because we choose to.
[00:16:02.271 --> 00:16:11.098]  And they claim the power to do this because of suspicious activity, inference, or inferences, in the Patriot Act I.
[00:16:12.921 --> 00:16:15.443]  And the Christian Science Monitor, of course, decries this.
[00:16:15.944 --> 00:16:17.185]  Folks, I've experienced it.
[00:16:17.205 --> 00:16:24.731]  I've been videotaping a checkpoint from 200 yards away in Austin, Texas, and have police run over and say, turn your camera off.
[00:16:25.171 --> 00:16:26.873]  And I say no, and they say, why?
[00:16:26.933 --> 00:16:29.755]  And I say, First Amendment, I'm going to own your house.
[00:16:30.095 --> 00:16:31.096]  Go ahead and arrest me.
[00:16:31.757 --> 00:16:32.637]  I will sue you.
[00:16:33.078 --> 00:16:35.360]  You can beat the rap, but you can't beat the ride.
[00:16:35.820 --> 00:16:37.902]  And they know exactly what that means.
[00:16:38.042 --> 00:16:39.223]  Do you want to hire a lawyer?
[00:16:39.915 --> 00:16:41.696]  Do you want to spend time and money?
[00:16:41.756 --> 00:16:43.457]  Because I will sue you!
[00:16:44.138 --> 00:16:44.998]  And they back off.
[00:16:46.119 --> 00:16:46.680]  Instantly.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:55.565]  Same thing finally happened in New York after being nice, I don't know, the 10th or 15th time, I never counted them up, it was three times a day at least, for six days in a row.
[00:16:56.446 --> 00:16:58.047]  Finally, I just heard it saying, I'm going to sue you!
[00:16:59.188 --> 00:17:00.008]  I'm going to sue you!
[00:17:00.569 --> 00:17:01.269]  Guaranteed!
[00:17:01.289 --> 00:17:06.072]  And they would move on and then arrest reporters, other reporters that groveled right in front of me.
[00:17:06.553 --> 00:17:09.615]  Basically, I would just lower my horns at the lions,
[00:17:10.561 --> 00:17:22.770]  And they would scurry off to attack some mindless, lemming wildebeest or an even more prey-like animal, let's say a gazelle.
[00:17:23.513 --> 00:17:24.934]  I mean, finally I just got sick of it.
[00:17:24.974 --> 00:17:26.394]  I mean, I'd be at ground zero.
[00:17:26.454 --> 00:17:27.275]  I'd be at a park.
[00:17:27.335 --> 00:17:28.755]  I'd be at Central Park.
[00:17:28.815 --> 00:17:37.119]  I'd be five miles from the convention center, Madison Square Garden, where I had full access right up to the president.
[00:17:37.599 --> 00:17:40.960]  Full, total, you know, gold access, folks.
[00:17:42.001 --> 00:17:43.141]  Maximum access.
[00:17:43.882 --> 00:17:44.982]  But it didn't matter to them.
[00:17:45.002 --> 00:17:47.163]  And it wasn't just that...
[00:17:47.785 --> 00:17:49.526]  You know, I was out talking about 9-11.
[00:17:49.566 --> 00:17:54.767]  It was, again, American Spectator writers and Reuters writers and TV crews.
[00:17:54.907 --> 00:18:08.572]  And the memo came out on New York Channel 1 that the police were ordered to harass media unless they were bivouacked in one of the big official TV broadcast centers around Madison Square Garden out in the open air and inside.
[00:18:10.232 --> 00:18:16.074]  I mean, I had associates there who had Fox News passes because that's who they were credentialed by through a radio station.
[00:18:16.767 --> 00:18:18.168]  And they were harassed.
[00:18:18.929 --> 00:18:20.350]  It did not matter.
[00:18:21.410 --> 00:18:22.831]  It did not matter.
[00:18:23.872 --> 00:18:25.673]  They were there to harass.
[00:18:25.713 --> 00:18:37.401]  Well, actually, in one case, Jack Blood had a Fox News pass, and he was being basically accosted by protesters who thought he was full of Fox News, and then secret police appear and usher him out of the crowd.
[00:18:38.642 --> 00:18:40.223]  We're telling him, come with us, come with us.
[00:18:42.785 --> 00:18:47.109]  I had a camera with him, but we didn't have a mic, so the audio is almost unintelligible.
[00:18:47.129 --> 00:18:50.973]  That's why I didn't put it in martial law, but I ought to put that on the web sometime.
[00:18:51.013 --> 00:18:51.373]  I don't know.
[00:18:52.454 --> 00:18:55.517]  Again, it's very hard to track what's happening because it's so loud.
[00:18:55.537 --> 00:18:56.638]  He's in the middle of a protest.
[00:18:57.259 --> 00:18:58.240]  Again, he's not mic'd.
[00:18:59.841 --> 00:19:01.283]  He's just got the general mic on.
[00:19:01.323 --> 00:19:04.105]  But I'm digressing.
[00:19:04.185 --> 00:19:07.989]  The point here is, and this is very important,
[00:19:08.809 --> 00:19:11.850]  That it's about the authority to shut down the free press.
[00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:27.857]  You know, it's like the cases, the innumerable cases of 5,000, 500, many different cases, 100 Bush supporters on a street corner in an unpermitted demonstration of support for the Fuhrer, the maximum great leader.
[00:19:28.557 --> 00:19:31.818]  And one guy has got a sign saying, no blood for oil or carry 2004.
[00:19:34.289 --> 00:19:37.191]  And the police march over and say, leave, or you'll be arrested.
[00:19:37.231 --> 00:19:42.514]  And they say no, and they're arrested under national security orders and convicted in federal court.
[00:19:44.035 --> 00:19:45.956]  So it's all selectively enforced.
[00:19:45.976 --> 00:19:47.677]  They've got all their cameras on us.
[00:19:48.598 --> 00:19:49.598]  Our cameras are back.
[00:19:50.419 --> 00:19:51.219]  Cite the Patriot.
[00:19:51.299 --> 00:19:51.960]  Back to do it.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.944]  They want to be unleashed, ravenously rend our Constitution.
[00:20:02.487 --> 00:20:08.009]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:20:08.169 --> 00:20:09.230]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.230]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:20:10.330 --> 00:20:13.171]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:20:13.351 --> 00:20:18.293]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:20:18.493 --> 00:20:19.593]  Check out this new product.
[00:20:19.733 --> 00:20:22.614]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:20:22.995 --> 00:20:26.696]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:20:26.856 --> 00:20:26.996]  Look.
[00:20:27.216 --> 00:20:29.478]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.
[00:20:29.598 --> 00:20:34.421]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:37.823]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[00:20:37.963 --> 00:20:43.366]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:20:43.446 --> 00:20:44.207]  Try Nobio.
[00:20:44.327 --> 00:20:45.327]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:20:46.488 --> 00:20:49.391]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[00:20:49.571 --> 00:20:51.794]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[00:20:52.635 --> 00:20:55.097]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[00:20:55.257 --> 00:20:58.541]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NoBO.
[00:20:58.741 --> 00:20:59.522]  That's no-bo.com.
[00:21:01.681 --> 00:21:05.162]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:21:05.442 --> 00:21:08.924]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:21:09.024 --> 00:21:12.965]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:21:13.185 --> 00:21:19.347]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:19.747 --> 00:21:27.670]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:33.412]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:21:33.572 --> 00:21:37.353]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:39.573]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:21:39.633 --> 00:21:41.794]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:46.976]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:21:47.016 --> 00:21:52.777]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:21:58.099 --> 00:21:59.819]  Protect your family.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:07.282]  To the farthest corners of the earth, explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:22:07.622 --> 00:22:09.963]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:22:10.183 --> 00:22:11.724]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:22:12.084 --> 00:22:17.185]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:22:17.486 --> 00:22:18.726]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[00:22:18.766 --> 00:22:21.467]  Coins, and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:22:21.867 --> 00:22:28.592]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[00:23:00.628 --> 00:23:03.131]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.771 --> 00:23:13.019]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:20.745]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:23:21.646 --> 00:23:23.067]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:23:23.307 --> 00:23:26.370]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[00:23:27.327 --> 00:23:27.807]  We're good to go.
[00:23:27.827 --> 00:23:28.008]  I think?
[00:23:46.927 --> 00:23:47.147]  516-8736.
[00:23:47.307 --> 00:23:51.349]  Call now.
[00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:58.151]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a one-year free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:24:15.347 --> 00:24:21.195]  1-800-259-9231 Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:23.117 --> 00:24:25.380]  Boy, there is a lot to cover here.
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:29.846]  A lot of different issues to discuss, but
[00:24:31.078 --> 00:24:40.664]  Here's another report here about all the new legislation, the ongoing rafts of legislation to dismantle the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:24:41.305 --> 00:24:44.587]  Records search plan alarms civil liberties groups.
[00:24:44.627 --> 00:24:45.468]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:24:46.048 --> 00:24:46.228]  U.S.
[00:24:46.248 --> 00:24:56.515]  civil liberties groups said on Monday that they are alarmed at new provisions to be considered in Congress this week to strengthen the government's ability to seize private records without judicial review.
[00:24:58.052 --> 00:25:02.236]  Again, they're not just repassing the Patriot Act, they're expanding it.
[00:25:03.137 --> 00:25:14.447]  Officials from the American Civil Liberties Union, which is always loyal opposition and loses fights on purpose, and defends rights that don't exist while claiming other rights don't exist, they're an amazing group.
[00:25:14.608 --> 00:25:20.113]  I'm not saying all members are bad, but I'm telling you folks, they're like the NRA, they're there to drop the ball.
[00:25:20.902 --> 00:25:35.695]  Officials from the American Civil Liberties Union, the Open Society Institute, and the Center for Democracy and Technology said in a telephone conference call that the new provisions of the Patriot Act would allow the FBI to secretly demand medical tax gun purchase.
[00:25:35.775 --> 00:25:36.396]  Did you hear that?
[00:25:37.076 --> 00:25:39.478]  Yes, Gun Owners of America has warned you.
[00:25:39.618 --> 00:25:40.639]  Federal database.
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:44.683]  Travel and other records without approval from a judge.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:54.904]  The act was passed shortly after September 11, 2001, and 16 of its provisions are scheduled to expire at the end of this year unless Congress renews them.
[00:25:55.504 --> 00:25:57.865]  And those 16 provisions are side issues.
[00:25:57.905 --> 00:25:59.646]  Again, they just admitted expand.
[00:26:00.447 --> 00:26:02.307]  It's built in to expand every five years.
[00:26:03.008 --> 00:26:14.413]  The Senate Intelligence Committee is scheduled to hold a closed session on Thursday to begin considering the renewal legislation, the first step towards a reauthorization vote sought by Lord Bush.
[00:26:15.091 --> 00:26:29.523]  The timetable could be disrupted by the current Senate showdown over judicial appointments, which, again, folks, you know I'm not on the Democrats or Republicans side, but the Founding Fathers said gridlock was good.
[00:26:30.083 --> 00:26:32.285]  It's called a separation of powers.
[00:26:32.726 --> 00:26:34.747]  You don't want the skids greased.
[00:26:34.867 --> 00:26:36.429]  You want things to move slowly.
[00:26:36.829 --> 00:26:39.331]  That's to stop a dictatorship developing.
[00:26:41.064 --> 00:26:50.189]  That's clearly in the Federalist Papers, clearly in the Anti-Federalist Papers, clearly in the published essays and editorials written by the Founding Fathers.
[00:26:50.749 --> 00:26:51.750]  You really should read them.
[00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.311]  I should dig them back out and read some of the quotes here.
[00:26:55.892 --> 00:27:00.615]  Gridlock is good, and we've been told that gridlock is bad.
[00:27:01.876 --> 00:27:04.377]  And clearly the Democrats are in the right here.
[00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:10.612]  Being obstructionist is at the heart of keeping this country free.
[00:27:10.632 --> 00:27:18.456]  Now, they're doing it for partisan reasons, and the Republicans try to block their nominees as well, and that's the way this is supposed to work.
[00:27:19.537 --> 00:27:25.060]  The Founding Fathers created three branches of government to have them set against each other.
[00:27:27.541 --> 00:27:30.503]  But that's not taught in school anymore.
[00:27:31.775 --> 00:27:36.777]  You know, I've called for the Patriot Movement to be fractured, to be diverse, the Truth Movement, whatever you want to call it.
[00:27:37.177 --> 00:27:40.419]  Many different leaders, many different ideas, diverse views.
[00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:47.482]  But so many people set themselves up as grand poobahs and then say, no, you must have my view on 9-11.
[00:27:47.522 --> 00:27:49.182]  You must have my view on taxes.
[00:27:49.602 --> 00:27:54.304]  You must have my views on what sect of Christianity to follow.
[00:27:55.025 --> 00:27:56.425]  And I say no to all of that.
[00:27:56.925 --> 00:27:57.926]  Centralized
[00:27:58.926 --> 00:28:01.687]  Is always extremely dangerous.
[00:28:04.468 --> 00:28:06.489]  I also want to get into the Pat Tillman situation.
[00:28:06.529 --> 00:28:09.170]  I spent a few minutes on this yesterday, but it really is a big deal.
[00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.071]  His family's coming out and saying, we've been lied to all along.
[00:28:12.131 --> 00:28:13.252]  It disgraces his death.
[00:28:13.272 --> 00:28:14.812]  You know, it's disgusting.
[00:28:14.852 --> 00:28:16.293]  He was the ultimate team player.
[00:28:16.713 --> 00:28:18.954]  You guys tried to use his death for propaganda.
[00:28:18.994 --> 00:28:19.674]  Shame on you.
[00:28:20.195 --> 00:28:20.755]  You killed him.
[00:28:21.935 --> 00:28:23.056]  So we'll go over that.
[00:28:23.156 --> 00:28:26.037]  French-EU treaty battle focuses on the undecided.
[00:28:26.914 --> 00:28:30.517]  In major polls, now the people are against the EU.
[00:28:30.577 --> 00:28:33.739]  The first time they're able to even vote on it, because now they're expanding the EU.
[00:28:34.459 --> 00:28:40.844]  But look for some side-winding, crab-like behavior from the EU minions.
[00:28:41.665 --> 00:28:42.585]  They're the globalists.
[00:28:43.406 --> 00:28:44.747]  I'm not counting them down.
[00:28:44.767 --> 00:28:45.928]  I hope it's shot down.
[00:28:46.408 --> 00:28:48.850]  But every time stuff is shot down, they just reintroduce it.
[00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:52.893]  Of course, Europeans weren't allowed to vote on original entry into the EU.
[00:28:54.057 --> 00:28:56.819]  But now they've demanded a vote, and so they're having one.
[00:28:57.439 --> 00:29:02.281]  And several countries over there are on the verge of pulling out.
[00:29:03.622 --> 00:29:06.404]  Not just France, but also the Netherlands as well.
[00:29:06.564 --> 00:29:10.886]  Al Sharpton says Mexico's fox making race spat worse.
[00:29:11.666 --> 00:29:12.607]  Which he certainly is.
[00:29:13.187 --> 00:29:18.670]  Berg lawsuit filed on behalf of another WTC witnesses, bomb witnesses.
[00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.591]  Philadelphia lawyer Phil Berg has never...
[00:29:21.317 --> 00:29:23.198]  We'll come back, take your calls, cover news as well, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:23.218 --> 00:29:24.018]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:29:51.866 --> 00:29:52.769]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.271 --> 00:29:54.876]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.799 --> 00:29:58.487]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.932 --> 00:30:04.275]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:30:04.555 --> 00:30:08.379]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:30:08.699 --> 00:30:09.520]  Read the labels.
[00:30:09.941 --> 00:30:14.085]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:14.286 --> 00:30:18.490]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:30:18.871 --> 00:30:23.736]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:30:24.096 --> 00:30:27.719]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:30:27.879 --> 00:30:33.223]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:30:33.503 --> 00:30:36.225]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:30:36.526 --> 00:30:37.426]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:30:37.727 --> 00:30:48.455]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:31:01.218 --> 00:31:03.199]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:13.985]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.365 --> 00:31:18.888]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.948 --> 00:31:30.294]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.874 --> 00:31:37.723]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.123 --> 00:31:40.266]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:40.747 --> 00:31:45.733]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.
[00:31:46.033 --> 00:31:52.776]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.976 --> 00:31:56.578]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.818 --> 00:31:57.558]  That's toll free.
[00:31:57.578 --> 00:31:57.618]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.073 --> 00:32:02.553]  We're good to go.
[00:32:25.219 --> 00:32:28.082]  And your cholesterol level's on its own without prescription drugs.
[00:32:28.222 --> 00:32:29.424]  And you'll have more energy.
[00:32:29.524 --> 00:32:34.289]  What's more, your body can clean and clear your arteries on its own as long as it has the proper nutrients.
[00:32:34.529 --> 00:32:37.533]  Everybody understands the importance of keeping their arteries clear.
[00:32:37.633 --> 00:32:42.098]  But did you know that in 25% of the cases, the first symptom of blocked arteries is...
[00:32:42.398 --> 00:32:42.799]  Death?
[00:32:42.919 --> 00:32:44.741]  Don't take unnecessary risks.
[00:32:44.961 --> 00:32:48.625]  Keep your arteries healthy and clear by taking Heart and Body Extract.
[00:32:48.665 --> 00:32:51.948]  To get Heart and Body Extract, go to heartandbodyextract.com or call 1-866-295-5305.
[00:32:51.968 --> 00:32:52.469]  That's 866-295-5305.
[00:32:52.509 --> 00:32:53.010]  Call now.
[00:33:21.064 --> 00:33:25.585]  Dave and others, your calls are coming up momentarily.
[00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:27.666]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:28.026 --> 00:33:40.409]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy's coming on in the next hour to talk about, well, how the globalists are going public with their plans for world government.
[00:33:40.449 --> 00:33:45.850]  Now it's just out in the open, always riveting and very enlightening to have Dr. Cuddy on with us.
[00:33:47.671 --> 00:33:49.211]  But before we go to your calls...
[00:33:50.433 --> 00:33:55.738]  The left is trying to draw parallels between the emperor and Star Wars and George Bush.
[00:33:55.758 --> 00:33:57.099]  We talked about that a lot last week.
[00:33:57.559 --> 00:34:00.241]  Here's a moveon.org ad they're running.
[00:34:00.522 --> 00:34:02.003]  Here's the audio from the TV ad.
[00:34:02.043 --> 00:34:02.744]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:34:03.564 --> 00:34:09.329]  For 200 years, the senators and the fair judges were keepers of peace and justice in the republic until...
[00:34:11.847 --> 00:34:20.352]  One senator, seduced by a dark vision of absolute power, seeks to destroy this fabled order, replacing fair judges with far-right clones.
[00:34:20.432 --> 00:34:25.195]  To do this, he's ready to use a nightmare weapon known as the Nuclear Option.
[00:34:26.076 --> 00:34:27.337]  Stop Senator Frist.
[00:34:27.617 --> 00:34:28.457]  Save our courts.
[00:34:28.718 --> 00:34:29.578]  Save the Republic.
[00:34:29.898 --> 00:34:32.920]  MoveOnPack is responsible for the content of this advertisement.
[00:34:33.881 --> 00:34:35.522]  Good, yes!
[00:34:36.182 --> 00:34:37.283]  Ah, good!
[00:34:39.747 --> 00:34:46.431]  Folks, again, it's the Democrats, the left, acting like they're the good guys, acting like there's a fight going on.
[00:34:47.011 --> 00:34:56.536]  They ought to make an ad where they show the left as the separatists working for the globalists, creating the illusion of a political war, all meant to centralize power.
[00:34:56.556 --> 00:35:03.700]  You want to make a real ad with parallels with Star Wars Episode III, Revenge of the Sith.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:07.022]  Oh, by the way, my review of it was not fair.
[00:35:07.774 --> 00:35:32.821]  I've had about four hours sleep the night before, done masses of interviews, was totally exhausted, got up, did an early morning interview, actually several early morning interviews, then did my own broadcast, then got on an airplane and flew to Minnesota, then went to an 11.30 movie, got out past 1 o'clock at night, the audio was low in the movie theater, and I just hated the movie.
[00:35:33.777 --> 00:35:34.817]  And gave it a bad review.
[00:35:35.837 --> 00:35:37.818]  Then my wife wanted to see it Sunday.
[00:35:38.558 --> 00:35:40.398]  And so we went to see it.
[00:35:41.378 --> 00:35:42.559]  And it was really a lot better.
[00:35:42.759 --> 00:35:45.439]  I mean, out of four stars, I'd give it three and a half.
[00:35:46.959 --> 00:35:51.820]  It really shows how perception is reality.
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:53.120]  I mean, sitting there exhausted.
[00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:56.101]  Ted Anderson was about as sleepy as I was.
[00:35:56.401 --> 00:35:58.641]  He was falling asleep in his chair, too, it looked like.
[00:35:59.201 --> 00:36:01.942]  And so was Chris, his cousin.
[00:36:02.867 --> 00:36:04.168]  I said his nephew, it's his cousin.
[00:36:04.208 --> 00:36:06.930]  But, you know, when a cousin's so much younger, it's kind of like Uncle Ted.
[00:36:06.970 --> 00:36:10.213]  By the way, Chris is a nice guy.
[00:36:10.413 --> 00:36:14.737]  He should still be in high school, but he's already finished his first year of college and going into medical school.
[00:36:15.437 --> 00:36:19.080]  Really nice fellow he got working at the network in affiliate relations, doing a great job.
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:27.647]  All right, you see, I get off into these long stories, but I'm done talking about Star Wars, but it has been a great way to wake up young people with these parallels, but
[00:36:28.897 --> 00:36:32.299]  The left likes to act like evil conservatives are taking over.
[00:36:32.659 --> 00:36:33.900]  Well, is Bush a conservative?
[00:36:33.940 --> 00:36:34.780]  He's for abortion.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:40.803]  Oh, I know on the service he says he isn't, but he appoints pro-abortion people who don't want parents to know when their 12-year-old has abortions.
[00:36:41.124 --> 00:36:42.084]  He increases U.N.
[00:36:42.124 --> 00:36:45.926]  abortion funding while cutting some of the funding, while radically increasing other funding.
[00:36:46.326 --> 00:36:47.287]  It's a smoke and mirrors.
[00:36:47.887 --> 00:36:53.130]  He's for gun control, appointing all these gun grabbers, for the assault weapons ban, for registering gun owners.
[00:36:54.868 --> 00:36:57.089]  Bob Barr and Governors of America put out those alerts.
[00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:58.149]  I mean, it's real, folks.
[00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:00.590]  He signed back on to UNESCO.
[00:37:01.530 --> 00:37:03.091]  On and on and on and on.
[00:37:03.191 --> 00:37:04.391]  So you guys should love him.
[00:37:05.271 --> 00:37:06.392]  But I've told the left this.
[00:37:06.432 --> 00:37:10.973]  I mean, if you really, you know, the policies you guys promote, well, you should love George Bush.
[00:37:11.713 --> 00:37:13.514]  You should just absolutely hail him.
[00:37:15.915 --> 00:37:20.196]  You wanted to pull your hair out and go, He's passing a national ID card!
[00:37:20.216 --> 00:37:21.297]  It's horrible!
[00:37:21.417 --> 00:37:22.037]  It's horrible!
[00:37:26.562 --> 00:37:34.365]  Meanwhile, it actually does nothing to stop the illegal aliens that you call immigrants and asylum seekers.
[00:37:35.286 --> 00:37:47.050]  And you notice 147 of them, Democrats, 100 to zip voted for that monstrosity, that abomination, that
[00:37:48.041 --> 00:37:58.251]  Gargantuan, colossal, mega-super-sized travesty that they passed a few weeks ago, the Super National ID card database slave grip.
[00:38:01.234 --> 00:38:03.036]  Well, I'm in rare form today, aren't I?
[00:38:03.056 --> 00:38:06.699]  Before we go to your calls, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:38:06.759 --> 00:38:07.280]  Before we do that...
[00:38:11.491 --> 00:38:17.956]  My new film, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, full title, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:38:18.616 --> 00:38:21.778]  I did Jeff Renz's broadcast last night, and I didn't know he was going to do this.
[00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:26.642]  He said it's the best film he's ever seen, the most powerful film he's ever seen.
[00:38:27.082 --> 00:38:31.706]  He gushed about it for 30 minutes, and Jeff's never done that about my other films, which are pretty good.
[00:38:32.866 --> 00:38:34.147]  It really is my best work.
[00:38:34.788 --> 00:38:37.830]  All the reviews have been insanely positive reviews.
[00:38:39.347 --> 00:38:41.908]  A lot of other people are pulling their hair out with jealousy.
[00:38:42.249 --> 00:38:44.169]  Hey, this film is for everybody.
[00:38:45.330 --> 00:38:46.990]  This is about getting the word out.
[00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:49.311]  This is about waking the people up.
[00:38:49.351 --> 00:38:54.173]  And I want you, when you get the film, or if you already have the film, to please make at least ten copies.
[00:38:54.553 --> 00:38:56.774]  Make a copy every night when you go to bed or when you go to work.
[00:38:57.375 --> 00:39:00.676]  Give a copy out every day on VHS or DVD.
[00:39:01.236 --> 00:39:02.117]  Go to the website.
[00:39:02.157 --> 00:39:04.217]  Download copies onto your disc.
[00:39:04.257 --> 00:39:06.258]  It's not as high quality, but it's watchable.
[00:39:06.958 --> 00:39:08.039]  Make copies of those.
[00:39:09.121 --> 00:39:12.424]  We could do that for, I think, as low as like 50 cents apiece, or even lower.
[00:39:12.824 --> 00:39:13.885]  Get them out to people.
[00:39:14.105 --> 00:39:19.890]  I mean, we can really affect change, and I want to commend those that have been doing this, but Jeff Rents said the same thing.
[00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:34.482]  He said it's multiple films in one, really three films in one, the police state, the latest 9-11 information, and then it dovetails in with the occult controllers of the elite,
[00:39:35.111 --> 00:39:39.514]  The real dark lords of the New World Order, the Nazi Connections, what their master plan is.
[00:39:40.074 --> 00:39:42.476]  It is such an important film, group of films.
[00:39:43.537 --> 00:39:49.781]  $25.95, second copy $19.95, third copy $16.95, fourth copy $14.95, fifth copy $14.
[00:39:49.881 --> 00:39:59.467]  And all of that goes to fund what we're doing and to make more films and to run these websites and to pay my webmasters and all the people that do great work for me.
[00:40:00.728 --> 00:40:03.870]  Go to prisonplanet.tv and watch the film right now.
[00:40:05.347 --> 00:40:16.054]  And watch the entire film, 15 cents a day, my 11 other films, all my weekly TV reports, every week at least one report, most weeks two reports, my best audio interviews, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[00:40:16.354 --> 00:40:18.255]  Folks, an e-book's usually $5.95 to $7.
[00:40:21.017 --> 00:40:25.400]  You get a whole bunch of e-books, a whole bunch of all my videos, a bunch of other videos have been authorized to post.
[00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:28.802]  Just so much information.
[00:40:29.662 --> 00:40:31.904]  15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[00:40:33.144 --> 00:40:33.845]  A cup of coffee.
[00:40:34.865 --> 00:40:36.326]  Is a dollar.
[00:40:37.506 --> 00:40:40.428]  Well, it's 15 cents a day at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:40:41.568 --> 00:40:45.751]  And believe me, we couldn't have continued if we wouldn't have launched the subscription service.
[00:40:45.811 --> 00:40:48.892]  And it is helping pay the webmasters now and expand what we do.
[00:40:48.952 --> 00:40:51.753]  And I want to commend those that are members of prisonplanet.tv.
[00:40:51.994 --> 00:40:53.314]  If you're not, get your membership today.
[00:40:53.654 --> 00:40:56.436]  Or call toll free to get hard copies of all the films and material.
[00:40:56.676 --> 00:41:00.818]  When you call, you can ask questions about the different plots and different information covered in the films.
[00:41:02.032 --> 00:41:02.192]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:41:02.232 --> 00:41:02.612]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:41:02.673 --> 00:41:06.275]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[00:41:26.129 --> 00:41:28.910]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Brett in North Carolina.
[00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:30.110]  That's not true.
[00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:30.851]  Kansas City.
[00:41:30.891 --> 00:41:32.051]  I'm getting these callers confused.
[00:41:32.671 --> 00:41:33.391]  Brett, go ahead.
[00:41:34.012 --> 00:41:34.352]  Hey, Alex.
[00:41:34.452 --> 00:41:35.292]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:41:35.612 --> 00:41:36.092]  You bet, sir.
[00:41:36.592 --> 00:41:43.195]  Hey, I was on Prison Point at TV last night listening to you talk about Hunter S. Thompson getting murdered and Gary Webb getting murdered.
[00:41:43.835 --> 00:41:46.396]  And that kind of parallels with something that happened to me.
[00:41:46.416 --> 00:41:50.597]  I mean, of course I didn't get murdered, but... Well, we asked the questions, were they murdered?
[00:41:51.485 --> 00:41:53.927]  Yeah, well... And the evidence leans in that direction.
[00:41:54.248 --> 00:42:18.569]  I think it's pretty obvious that they were, but I was visited by Homeland Security, supposedly doing a background check on somebody who used to live in my apartment, and Hunter S. Thompson and Gary Webb, they both talked about professional agents, you know, visiting their homes and, you know, checking out their documents and things like that, and I was just wondering if you could comment on if, you know...
[00:42:20.456 --> 00:42:34.790]  It's done on a selective basis to create an atmosphere of fear, create a chilling effect because they're panicking because we're waking everybody up.
[00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:36.692]  Now, sir, I'm going to need to get your phone number.
[00:42:36.712 --> 00:42:38.333]  I'm going to need to check this out.
[00:42:38.353 --> 00:42:40.075]  I'm going to need to talk to your apartment manager.
[00:42:40.095 --> 00:42:41.576]  I'm going to need to confirm this.
[00:42:41.596 --> 00:42:43.178]  This will be a major news issue.
[00:42:44.138 --> 00:42:45.700]  But give us details.
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:47.701]  I mean, so, what were their names?
[00:42:47.781 --> 00:42:48.302]  What happened?
[00:42:48.342 --> 00:42:49.483]  What transpired?
[00:42:50.223 --> 00:42:50.904]  It was one guy.
[00:42:50.924 --> 00:42:52.225]  His name was Nathan Humes.
[00:42:52.245 --> 00:42:53.766]  His badge number was... Hold on.
[00:42:53.806 --> 00:42:54.127]  Hold on.
[00:42:54.167 --> 00:42:54.327]  Hold on.
[00:42:54.347 --> 00:42:54.987]  Let me write this down.
[00:42:56.068 --> 00:42:59.211]  Nathan Humes.
[00:42:59.451 --> 00:42:59.731]  Okay.
[00:42:59.751 --> 00:43:00.712]  And his badge number?
[00:43:01.933 --> 00:43:00.712]  0918.
[00:43:03.014 --> 00:43:05.216]  0918.
[00:43:03.634 --> 00:43:05.216]  And he said he was with Homeland Security?
[00:43:06.116 --> 00:43:06.517]  Yes, sir.
[00:43:07.137 --> 00:43:10.780]  And he said he was checking on a background check.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:11.541]  What division?
[00:43:13.151 --> 00:43:14.071]  I'm not positive.
[00:43:14.352 --> 00:43:16.632]  He just said, I'm with Homeland Security.
[00:43:16.672 --> 00:43:17.573]  How was he dressed?
[00:43:18.073 --> 00:43:20.013]  He was dressed professionally.
[00:43:21.214 --> 00:43:24.375]  Like I said, I was really nervous about the whole thing.
[00:43:25.015 --> 00:43:28.016]  Okay, well, tell me what happened in the conversation.
[00:43:28.596 --> 00:43:40.840]  Okay, well, he knocked on my door, and I was actually making a protest sign, so this protest was about to go through, and so I just said, come in, because I didn't want to get up, and I guess that was kind of dumb of me, but he came in,
[00:43:42.413 --> 00:43:44.874]  And he was real professional, really nice.
[00:43:44.954 --> 00:43:48.175]  He was looking around my apartment, and he was just saying that he was doing a background check.
[00:43:48.215 --> 00:43:49.096]  Hi!
[00:43:49.776 --> 00:43:51.177]  So, tell me what he said.
[00:43:51.217 --> 00:43:53.358]  He said, we're doing a background check on who?
[00:43:53.498 --> 00:43:57.039]  A girl who used to live in my apartment, the previous tenant.
[00:43:57.439 --> 00:44:01.541]  And I've talked to people who have had background checks done on them, and they said that that's not...
[00:44:02.031 --> 00:44:03.372]  That's not regular policy.
[00:44:03.632 --> 00:44:06.655]  Okay, but you've been involved in a lot of demonstrations?
[00:44:07.556 --> 00:44:07.956]  A few.
[00:44:09.117 --> 00:44:14.341]  I woke up last October, so I'm... What type of demonstrations have you gone to?
[00:44:15.702 --> 00:44:20.686]  There was a marriage amendment proposed here in Kansas, and it actually passed, but I was demonstrating against that.
[00:44:22.428 --> 00:44:23.909]  There's an activist in Topeka.
[00:44:24.009 --> 00:44:29.894]  I don't want to give out his name because he's a very racist person, and I don't want to give him any publicity, but I was demonstrating against him.
[00:44:30.734 --> 00:44:30.834]  Ah!
[00:44:31.374 --> 00:44:42.777]  And the thing is, I actually called your show back in March, and Lee Hamilton from the 9-11 Commission was speaking at my university, Kansas State University.
[00:44:42.837 --> 00:44:45.078]  And you said that you wanted to know what to ask him.
[00:44:45.498 --> 00:44:45.958]  Yes, sir.
[00:44:46.298 --> 00:44:49.399]  And this happened a week after I went and questioned him.
[00:44:49.459 --> 00:44:51.259]  I ask a ton of hardcore questions about 9-11.
[00:44:51.659 --> 00:44:52.600]  Oh, that's why, sir.
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:57.661]  They took a photo of you, they followed you, they got your license number, and it's just intimidation.
[00:44:58.587 --> 00:44:59.527]  Well, I'm not intimidated.
[00:44:59.567 --> 00:45:00.568]  I'm not scared by these people.
[00:45:00.588 --> 00:45:00.668]  Good.
[00:45:00.728 --> 00:45:01.548]  Redouble your efforts.
[00:45:01.608 --> 00:45:01.928]  Oh, no.
[00:45:01.948 --> 00:45:03.949]  We're going to be calling Nathan Humes.
[00:45:04.009 --> 00:45:04.269]  Listen.
[00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.990]  Listen, sir.
[00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:08.931]  Did you hear about in... I mean, let me just pick one of 100 examples in the last few months.
[00:45:09.572 --> 00:45:20.716]  When Bush was going to be going to Nashville, Tennessee, on a street over from his parade route, the businesses got calls saying, don't have any Bush signs, any Bush signs in your windows.
[00:45:21.176 --> 00:45:22.497]  And the guy that ran the coffee shop
[00:45:23.188 --> 00:45:24.669]  He said, wait a minute, I'm a Vietnam veteran.
[00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:26.491]  I was pro-Bush, but I'm not now.
[00:45:26.551 --> 00:45:28.192]  I'm going to put a sign up about what you did.
[00:45:29.173 --> 00:45:31.435]  Agents told me not to be anti-Bush.
[00:45:31.455 --> 00:45:32.316]  He put the sign up.
[00:45:33.096 --> 00:45:35.158]  I mean, this is massive, sir.
[00:45:35.839 --> 00:45:43.045]  And they've also gone out and harassed activists, conservative, gun activists, liberal activists.
[00:45:43.465 --> 00:45:44.926]  And we can give up the Second Amendment.
[00:45:44.946 --> 00:45:46.067]  We can give up our sovereignty.
[00:45:46.087 --> 00:45:47.288]  They've harassed the Minutemen.
[00:45:47.708 --> 00:45:49.390]  They wouldn't let the head of the Minutemen...
[00:45:50.376 --> 00:45:51.457]  No sir, she lived there before me.
[00:45:51.477 --> 00:45:54.978]  Okay, and then, I mean, it's important for me to hear details.
[00:45:55.018 --> 00:45:56.399]  What else did he say?
[00:46:18.525 --> 00:46:20.927]  He just said he was doing a background check on her.
[00:46:20.947 --> 00:46:23.608]  I was asking him questions why he needed to talk to me about it.
[00:46:23.968 --> 00:46:25.869]  And he just said, well, I've got my walking orders.
[00:46:25.909 --> 00:46:27.550]  And I was like, oh, yes, Nuremberg code.
[00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:28.231]  I understand.
[00:46:28.251 --> 00:46:30.652]  You know, just following orders and stuff like that.
[00:46:31.312 --> 00:46:38.076]  And he just kind of stood there and just kind of the minion that he was, you know, and...
[00:46:39.562 --> 00:46:41.583]  Did he say he was out of the Kansas City office?
[00:46:42.123 --> 00:46:43.223]  He didn't say where he was from.
[00:46:43.283 --> 00:46:45.224]  I asked for his badge.
[00:46:45.264 --> 00:46:46.084]  He showed it to me.
[00:46:46.924 --> 00:46:48.205]  He was very forthcoming with that.
[00:46:48.605 --> 00:46:49.945]  And that's Nathan Hume, 0918?
[00:46:50.005 --> 00:46:53.767]  Yeah, well, it's Nathan Hume, no F on the end.
[00:46:53.807 --> 00:46:55.947]  Hume.
[00:46:55.987 --> 00:46:56.928]  Yeah, 0918.
[00:46:58.248 --> 00:46:59.608]  Okay, and how long was he there?
[00:47:00.129 --> 00:47:01.589]  He was there for maybe five minutes.
[00:47:01.989 --> 00:47:07.391]  And then he was asking for my landlord's phone number and things like that.
[00:47:08.286 --> 00:47:09.648]  And I said I didn't have it.
[00:47:09.668 --> 00:47:13.072]  So do you live in a large apartment complex or a home?
[00:47:13.412 --> 00:47:17.657]  There are 13 apartments in this complex, and I live in a two-bedroom apartment.
[00:47:17.677 --> 00:47:20.000]  And I'm sure the phone number is posted by the mailboxes.
[00:47:21.722 --> 00:47:22.823]  I'm pretty sure it is.
[00:47:22.983 --> 00:47:23.704]  Of course it is.
[00:47:24.184 --> 00:47:25.726]  There's a lot of regulations on that.
[00:47:26.687 --> 00:47:28.870]  Sir, you were given a fishing expedition.
[00:47:29.631 --> 00:47:34.533]  This happened to me many years ago, and I would just laugh at them and give them a copy of the video.
[00:47:35.033 --> 00:47:46.598]  Then once I had special forces come up to me in a parking lot and basically threaten me, and I just said, I hope you're glad you're killing this country, and I hope you enjoy breathing DU that the government uses against you, and I hope you enjoy the experimental vaccines.
[00:47:46.998 --> 00:47:48.999]  I love you, and I hope you'll wake up.
[00:47:49.019 --> 00:47:50.539]  And those guys melted.
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:51.660]  They melted.
[00:47:52.489 --> 00:47:54.351]  And, you know, I don't hate them.
[00:47:54.411 --> 00:47:55.411]  I'm sad for them.
[00:47:55.892 --> 00:47:59.554]  But remember the doctor, Quad City Times, called and complained too much.
[00:48:00.015 --> 00:48:04.898]  Homeland Security arrested him and said, well, he didn't threaten anybody, but complaining too much is bad.
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:08.741]  So I'd say you got something done.
[00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:13.965]  What did you say to Lee Hamilton, one of the chief whitewashers of the unindependent 9-11 commission?
[00:48:14.566 --> 00:48:16.087]  Well, pretty much, I just gave a little speech.
[00:48:16.687 --> 00:48:17.328]  What did you say?
[00:48:19.193 --> 00:48:34.417]  I started asking questions, you know, why the Ben Rodens were flown out, why Larry Silverstein said he pulled the building on America Rebuilding on PBS, asked him about, you know, the steel columns and WTC, the 9-11... Do you know somebody that got video of that?
[00:48:34.458 --> 00:48:37.298]  Because I'd love to get that footage.
[00:48:38.299 --> 00:48:44.720]  I taped it on audio, but the thing is... Well, I guarantee you, you can get in touch with some of the other activists there, and they have video.
[00:48:45.621 --> 00:48:47.221]  Or does Lordship not allow video?
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.002]  You know, I looked around for video cameras and I didn't see any.
[00:48:52.023 --> 00:48:53.584]  I assure you there were video cameras.
[00:48:53.864 --> 00:48:54.124]  Okay.
[00:48:54.705 --> 00:48:56.266]  I will try and get in touch with people.
[00:48:56.326 --> 00:48:56.706]  Yeah, I know.
[00:48:56.726 --> 00:48:58.528]  I mean, it'll be some easy work to do that.
[00:48:58.708 --> 00:48:59.568]  I'd put it on the website.
[00:48:59.889 --> 00:49:03.031]  So, how did he respond to you?
[00:49:03.491 --> 00:49:08.895]  He only responded... And then I asked him about the CFR and trilateral commission, of which he's a member of both.
[00:49:09.136 --> 00:49:10.757]  And he kind of laughed that one off.
[00:49:11.237 --> 00:49:13.139]  I've been on Jack Blood's show with this, too.
[00:49:13.219 --> 00:49:14.460]  He kind of laughed that one off.
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:14.860]  And then...
[00:49:15.410 --> 00:49:18.571]  The only other question he addressed was why the Bin Ladens were flown out.
[00:49:19.652 --> 00:49:20.692]  And I disagreed with him.
[00:49:20.732 --> 00:49:26.494]  He said they were flown out while America was still allowed to fly.
[00:49:26.514 --> 00:49:27.635]  And I said, no, that's not true.
[00:49:27.675 --> 00:49:28.515]  We weren't allowed to fly.
[00:49:28.555 --> 00:49:30.296]  Well, this is how they do the deception.
[00:49:30.416 --> 00:49:31.616]  This is how they do the deception.
[00:49:31.636 --> 00:49:33.937]  Three days after, they had a couple plane loads that left.
[00:49:34.257 --> 00:49:39.179]  Then another group of Bin Ladens, like five days later, flew out when the ban had been lifted.
[00:49:39.279 --> 00:49:41.700]  So they do bait and switch and focus on that.
[00:49:42.239 --> 00:49:42.919]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:42.999 --> 00:49:47.601]  And then he was talking about the CFR and trilateral permission, and he was like, I will not make a defense of that.
[00:49:47.661 --> 00:49:48.801]  They're just think tanks.
[00:49:48.941 --> 00:49:56.163]  And then I quoted Admiral Chester Ward when he said it's the one government organization that wants to destroy America.
[00:49:56.263 --> 00:50:00.004]  And then I quoted Gary Hart from one of your films, actually.
[00:50:00.044 --> 00:50:02.565]  We need to use this disaster for a new world order.
[00:50:02.645 --> 00:50:03.105]  Exactly.
[00:50:04.437 --> 00:50:06.778]  Well, see, you stung him badly.
[00:50:07.058 --> 00:50:20.102]  You're out in the light, on the field, riding out like a white knight, facing the dragon, literally, and they didn't like it, and his ministers didn't like it, and his pops and pimps didn't like it, and so they tried to intimidate you.
[00:50:20.342 --> 00:50:21.042]  Redouble!
[00:50:21.282 --> 00:50:22.882]  Redouble your efforts!
[00:50:23.463 --> 00:50:24.463]  Well done!
[00:50:24.483 --> 00:50:25.223]  Thank you.
[00:50:25.923 --> 00:50:27.404]  You deserve a medal, my friend.
[00:50:27.424 --> 00:50:28.344]  Well done!
[00:50:28.364 --> 00:50:29.404]  I don't know about that.
[00:50:29.444 --> 00:50:31.945]  I'm just standing up for our republic, Alex.
[00:50:32.884 --> 00:50:38.209]  You rode out a defender of the realm, a captain at the helm.
[00:50:38.229 --> 00:50:41.091]  I can only salute you.
[00:50:42.372 --> 00:50:43.053]  Well done.
[00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:44.915]  Now get me more information.
[00:50:44.935 --> 00:50:45.956]  Write an article about this.
[00:50:46.056 --> 00:50:48.037]  Email it to TimpsonInfoAwards.com.
[00:50:48.077 --> 00:50:48.738]  We will post it.
[00:50:49.278 --> 00:50:49.839]  Okay, thank you.
[00:50:49.859 --> 00:50:51.480]  All right, well done, Brett.
[00:50:52.341 --> 00:50:54.043]  Again, I salute you.
[00:50:54.063 --> 00:50:55.204]  I salute you.
[00:50:55.404 --> 00:50:56.204]  I salute you.
[00:51:01.676 --> 00:51:03.197]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.397 --> 00:51:06.460]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:10.503]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.543 --> 00:51:14.787]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:51:15.127 --> 00:51:18.910]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.050 --> 00:51:20.852]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:24.115 --> 00:51:29.100]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.260 --> 00:51:32.323]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.483 --> 00:51:35.366]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.847 --> 00:51:41.973]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.493 --> 00:51:44.574]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:01.198 --> 00:52:05.102]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:05.322 --> 00:52:10.767]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:11.047 --> 00:52:21.437]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.577 --> 00:52:25.921]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.101 --> 00:52:34.466]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:34.726 --> 00:52:41.009]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odor.
[00:52:41.129 --> 00:52:43.090]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:43.110 --> 00:52:43.311]  That's 888-803-4438.

[00:54:13.388 --> 00:54:14.789]  I want to get to everybody.
[00:54:14.849 --> 00:54:15.790]  Dr. Cuddy's coming up.
[00:54:16.170 --> 00:54:17.490]  Dave in Illinois, thanks for holding.
[00:54:17.511 --> 00:54:18.131]  Go ahead, Dave.
[00:54:19.211 --> 00:54:25.895]  Well, Alex, on Sunday it looks like they started more war games in Bolger Center, Atomic, Maryland.
[00:54:26.992 --> 00:54:29.474]  They've also got them going on in Florida.
[00:54:29.835 --> 00:54:32.317]  Huge takeover drills desensitizing the public.
[00:54:33.137 --> 00:54:41.685]  Yeah, it says the goal is to give the Joint Combined Force Commanders knowledge base for separating adversaries from the rest of the population.
[00:54:42.085 --> 00:54:44.667]  Yeah, they're internment roundup drills.
[00:54:44.687 --> 00:54:46.108]  We have it in Police State 2000.
[00:54:46.569 --> 00:54:47.249]  Tell me more.
[00:54:47.950 --> 00:54:55.176]  It says they're going to have DOD organizations, non-governmental organizations, and private volunteer organizations.
[00:54:55.734 --> 00:54:57.394]  That are going to be in this thing.
[00:54:57.975 --> 00:55:14.199]  Now, see, that's absolutely key, because they do this other places, and they always claim in the newspaper it's for overseas, but then when you go to the drill, it's for America with the police, the firemen, local tattletale squads, all together practicing rounding up and arresting and interrogating people.
[00:55:14.259 --> 00:55:18.880]  And we have, again, video of that in Police State 2000 and in Police State 2, the takeover.
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:22.101]  But which newspaper is that out of?
[00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:27.050]  Oh, this is actually right from the Department of Defense's website.
[00:55:27.070 --> 00:55:28.071]  Send me a link to that.
[00:55:28.111 --> 00:55:30.672]  I've got to get that linked up on Infowars and Prison Planet.
[00:55:31.312 --> 00:55:35.513]  Yeah, it says they're having a multinational forces with the British leading the force.
[00:55:36.273 --> 00:55:43.576]  And another thing is Northrop Grumman has a thing out that they can scan your license plate numbers now.
[00:55:43.896 --> 00:55:46.737]  I guess this is until they get the ID chips in there.
[00:55:47.997 --> 00:55:50.318]  That's already gone up in most of the cameras, isn't it?
[00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:59.093]  Yeah, so like, you know, when you go to a protest, instead of having to take all the pictures, let's just all scan it right to the center database.
[00:55:59.253 --> 00:56:01.955]  Well, but if we let that be a chilling effect, we're going to lose.
[00:56:01.975 --> 00:56:03.696]  We've got to say, yes, we're the good people.
[00:56:03.976 --> 00:56:05.236]  Yes, we're defending America.
[00:56:06.177 --> 00:56:07.558]  Yeah.
[00:56:07.638 --> 00:56:11.820]  And we need to photograph them, which we did in New York when they were photographing us, and put them on the web.
[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:14.081]  Who can play at that game?
[00:56:14.881 --> 00:56:15.062]  Yeah.
[00:56:15.442 --> 00:56:17.763]  But again, our stuff doesn't go in some secret database.
[00:56:18.183 --> 00:56:19.584]  Millions of people see it.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:20.960]  Yeah.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.461]  This isn't a game, folks.
[00:56:22.841 --> 00:56:23.621]  This is for real.
[00:56:23.661 --> 00:56:24.421]  This is for keeps.
[00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:27.882]  I wish they'd put all the secret police on the border, but they won't.
[00:56:29.063 --> 00:56:31.703]  Yep, it's a new Nazi something or other.
[00:56:32.504 --> 00:56:39.366]  Well, now, you were reading where it said other volunteer organizations, along with these wondrous foreign troops and our own military.
[00:56:39.406 --> 00:56:41.426]  How many different branches of our military are going to be there?
[00:56:42.587 --> 00:56:43.507]  Um, it's pretty vague.
[00:56:43.567 --> 00:56:48.649]  It says pretty much the Marines, and they're co-sponsoring it.
[00:56:49.509 --> 00:56:49.589]  Um...
[00:56:50.330 --> 00:56:51.971]  The Air Force is going to be there.
[00:56:52.171 --> 00:56:54.313]  I wish you'd go to that town and videotape it.
[00:56:55.213 --> 00:56:57.114]  Yeah, it's in Maryland and I'm in Illinois.
[00:56:57.835 --> 00:56:58.435]  I understand.
[00:56:58.635 --> 00:56:59.816]  Somebody's got to cover that.
[00:57:00.557 --> 00:57:04.339]  Yeah, it's been going on, I guess, it'll be from Sunday till Thursday.
[00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:10.203]  Promise me you'll email it to tipsandinfowars.com and I'll get it posted right now.
[00:57:10.863 --> 00:57:11.324]  Okie dokie.
[00:57:11.604 --> 00:57:12.224]  Hey, good job.
[00:57:12.304 --> 00:57:13.345]  I appreciate the call, Dave.
[00:57:14.305 --> 00:57:17.908]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Who's up next?
[00:57:18.533 --> 00:57:19.634]  Stacey in Illinois.
[00:57:19.674 --> 00:57:20.495]  Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:57:20.855 --> 00:57:21.375]  Hi, Alex.
[00:57:21.415 --> 00:57:27.820]  I just wanted to ask you if you have contacted Pat Tillman's parents about putting them on your show, would they be interested in speaking?
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.142]  Well, they're divorced, and we're attempting to call them.
[00:57:30.822 --> 00:57:31.223]  Good job.
[00:57:33.124 --> 00:57:33.725]  Anything else?
[00:57:33.825 --> 00:57:34.485]  No, that was it.
[00:57:34.525 --> 00:57:36.767]  I just wanted to know if you guys have been on the ball with that.
[00:57:36.807 --> 00:57:37.367]  Good job, Alex.
[00:57:37.547 --> 00:57:37.928]  Thank you.
[00:57:37.968 --> 00:57:40.710]  Yeah, they've been set upon by the media.
[00:57:42.167 --> 00:57:46.569]  And so they get desensitized, I'm sure, by I would imagine hundreds of phone calls.
[00:57:47.209 --> 00:57:48.709]  But we are attempting it.
[00:57:50.130 --> 00:57:54.311]  And again, they've gone public and said it's all a complete fable, a complete fraud that disgraces his death.
[00:57:54.991 --> 00:58:01.853]  The government killed him, the military killed him, and then they tried to make up a lie, and then now they tried to lie about that lie, and it's disgraceful.
[00:58:04.694 --> 00:58:05.915]  Very disgraceful.
[00:58:05.975 --> 00:58:10.176]  Remember, police and military, when you work for the New World Order, they will use you up
[00:58:11.252 --> 00:58:11.953]  They hate you.
[00:58:11.973 --> 00:58:13.854]  They hate it that you love this country.
[00:58:13.894 --> 00:58:14.975]  They're using you.
[00:58:14.995 --> 00:58:17.777]  They love giving you experimental injections.
[00:58:17.797 --> 00:58:19.198]  They love you breathing the DU.
[00:58:19.239 --> 00:58:20.319]  And they won't give you treatment.
[00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:22.881]  They won't help you when you have that deformed baby.
[00:58:23.282 --> 00:58:23.882]  God forbid.
[00:58:25.243 --> 00:58:26.264]  We do care about you.
[00:58:26.624 --> 00:58:27.485]  We have the evidence.
[00:58:27.525 --> 00:58:28.526]  We defend the republic.
[00:58:28.946 --> 00:58:30.508]  We stand with the founding fathers.
[00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:32.629]  You stand with us.
[00:58:33.390 --> 00:58:34.451]  You stand with honor.
[00:58:35.171 --> 00:58:37.293]  You have the courage to face the lies.
[00:58:38.054 --> 00:58:39.675]  The courage to defend the republic.
[00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:41.611]  In the battle for the Republic?
[00:58:42.351 --> 00:58:47.193]  Or do you serve the dark forces of the New World Order?
[00:58:47.993 --> 00:58:49.954]  Second hour, seconds away.
[00:58:49.974 --> 00:58:50.655]  Hello!
[00:58:51.955 --> 00:58:53.696]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.997 --> 00:59:00.058]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.778 --> 00:59:01.879]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.519 --> 00:59:03.380]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:04.981]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.021 --> 00:59:09.303]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.863 --> 00:59:13.966]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.987 --> 00:59:26.353]  Coming up in about five minutes, Dr. Dennis Cuddy, expert on the New World Order, will be joining us to talk about some new developments and scary trends inside the global slave state.
[00:59:28.323 --> 00:59:32.285]  A plethora of vital news and information coming up as well we'll be discussing.
[00:59:33.706 --> 00:59:35.607]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:59:35.767 --> 00:59:38.268]  Jeff in New York, you're on the air, Jeff.
[00:59:38.969 --> 00:59:39.929]  Alex, good to talk to you.
[00:59:40.350 --> 00:59:40.710]  Welcome.
[00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:43.051]  Hey, the new movie is great, by the way.
[00:59:43.591 --> 00:59:46.293]  What I called about, I've been filming black helicopters here.
[00:59:46.333 --> 00:59:50.415]  I live between Fort Drum and Stunica Army Depot.
[00:59:51.161 --> 01:00:06.350]  And last week I filmed one with my video camera, a Bell 206 Jet Ranger with the globe radar array over the main rotor and on the rear skid, the bottom skid, was a... Yeah, that's a command and control helicopter.
[01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.432]  This one had an aerosol sprayer on the bottom skid.
[01:00:10.853 --> 01:00:11.673]  I got it on film.
[01:00:12.033 --> 01:00:14.995]  The other thing I called out... Do you know how to upload that to the web?
[01:00:15.836 --> 01:00:16.396]  No idea.
[01:00:17.362 --> 01:00:19.463]  Maybe I can find somebody who knows how.
[01:00:20.023 --> 01:00:21.204]  Dump a copy and mail it.
[01:00:21.244 --> 01:00:22.364]  Make sure it's clearly marked.
[01:00:23.084 --> 01:00:24.565]  I'll show you my other ones, too, on there.
[01:00:25.325 --> 01:00:39.831]  Another thing I got on our local CBS News affiliate a few weeks ago, they said a new project starting at Fort Drum where they were changing the uniforms to have also emblems on them, so all the emblems, including the American flag, can be peeled off at any time.
[01:00:40.916 --> 01:00:44.218]  One soldier they interviewed... Well, we were just covering the article out of Maryland.
[01:00:44.238 --> 01:00:45.298]  They got it going on in Florida.
[01:00:45.318 --> 01:00:50.341]  All these foreign troops with our troops working with the local police for domestic operations.
[01:00:50.401 --> 01:00:52.962]  I mean, folks, they're getting ready for something big.
[01:00:53.002 --> 01:00:53.662]  It's very obvious.
[01:00:53.682 --> 01:00:56.984]  They said it's going to be spreading from there to all of the uniforms soon enough.
[01:00:59.685 --> 01:01:02.926]  Well, I mean, those black berets helped merge us into the European look.
[01:01:03.787 --> 01:01:06.188]  Weren't the original black berets made in China?
[01:01:07.589 --> 01:01:09.049]  Well, they're not even originally.
[01:01:09.069 --> 01:01:10.210]  I believe they still are.
[01:01:11.533 --> 01:01:11.993]  That's nice.
[01:01:13.794 --> 01:01:14.854]  Well, you know... That's all I got, Alex.
[01:01:15.814 --> 01:01:16.735]  Well, thanks for the call.
[01:01:16.775 --> 01:01:17.375]  I appreciate it.
[01:01:17.395 --> 01:01:18.135]  Yeah, send me that.
[01:01:18.155 --> 01:01:18.975]  That sounds interesting.
[01:01:19.356 --> 01:01:21.016]  Eric in California.
[01:01:21.056 --> 01:01:21.736]  Welcome, Eric.
[01:01:22.076 --> 01:01:23.777]  Hey, thanks for having me on again for the billionth time.
[01:01:24.057 --> 01:01:27.498]  Hey, I'm calling to ask more about the military.
[01:01:27.538 --> 01:01:29.699]  Now, with... Okay, one thing.
[01:01:30.179 --> 01:01:32.960]  I think it was in Police State 2 you showed how...
[01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:37.672]  During the Seattle riot, how the First Amendment was oppressed.
[01:01:37.712 --> 01:01:38.492]  Now, here's the thing.
[01:01:38.512 --> 01:01:40.133]  I'm going to play devil's advocate for you.
[01:01:41.653 --> 01:01:48.416]  Isn't it necessary to somehow put martial law under an area that's under riot?
[01:01:48.536 --> 01:01:49.056]  I mean, come on.
[01:01:49.076 --> 01:01:49.756]  Look at Seattle.
[01:01:49.776 --> 01:01:50.577]  Seattle was rioting.
[01:01:50.617 --> 01:01:51.857]  They had the WTL there.
[01:01:52.137 --> 01:01:53.258]  Good!
[01:01:53.318 --> 01:01:54.418]  You understand.
[01:01:54.678 --> 01:01:55.459]  Excellent!
[01:01:55.479 --> 01:01:57.059]  I mean, I'm not saying like,
[01:01:59.016 --> 01:02:07.864]  Oh, yes, we must have Frito-Sweets, but, I mean, if someone is going to movie theaters going, fire, fire, fire, and there's no fire, isn't that going to create more problems?
[01:02:08.865 --> 01:02:10.746]  Yes, exactly!
[01:02:10.766 --> 01:02:12.668]  Good!
[01:02:13.189 --> 01:02:15.651]  Sir, sir, let me be serious with you, Eric.
[01:02:16.572 --> 01:02:18.193]  All right, let me try to respond to this.
[01:02:19.134 --> 01:02:20.175]  If you've seen the film...
[01:02:21.215 --> 01:02:42.175]  You saw that the people causing the hundred or so black bloc, or black anarchists, they're not black people, folks, they call themselves the black bloc, they wear black outfits similar to the police, were trained at a local facility, were housed at a local facility, the police were ordered not to stop them, then they retired under police protection, we have video in the newscast and all of it,
[01:02:42.822 --> 01:02:49.024]  And then the police began savagely attacking the 60,000 peaceful demonstrators, putting them in the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:02:49.604 --> 01:02:55.205]  Nowhere in the main area of the city could you even have an anti-WTO pin on your shirt.
[01:02:55.265 --> 01:02:58.546]  They were arresting people and said there's no more First Amendment.
[01:02:59.907 --> 01:03:01.827]  And it was all admitted that it was staged.
[01:03:01.867 --> 01:03:03.548]  And no one was yelling fire in the theater.
[01:03:03.908 --> 01:03:08.509]  And so having people having anti-WTO signs wasn't causing a problem.
[01:03:09.153 --> 01:03:12.436]  Now, the argument could be with the police is if you're rioting, we'll arrest you.
[01:03:12.736 --> 01:03:16.340]  Not if someone has an anti-WTO sign, we're going to arrest you.
[01:03:17.381 --> 01:03:20.183]  Now, what is your major... I mean, are you joking with me?
[01:03:20.604 --> 01:03:24.948]  Oh, no, no, I'm not trying to joke with you, but I'm just trying to like... Mrs. Jones, it's so hard to believe that...
[01:03:25.268 --> 01:03:29.871]  We're having this huge New World Order thing, and it's just... Yes, it's hard to believe exactly.
[01:03:29.911 --> 01:03:31.151]  Go back to sleep.
[01:03:31.652 --> 01:03:33.733]  It's just all... It's like, what do you think we need to do?
[01:03:33.753 --> 01:03:34.573]  I'm only one person.
[01:03:34.613 --> 01:03:37.195]  I can't... Well, then just do what you can.
[01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:38.316]  Eric.
[01:03:38.336 --> 01:03:40.357]  Eric, just deny it's going on.
[01:03:40.397 --> 01:03:41.477]  That'll make it go away.
[01:03:41.637 --> 01:03:43.519]  No, I've been told, like, oh, you're... No.
[01:03:43.759 --> 01:03:49.842]  ...stating a disturbance, and I've been told, you know, you could be arrested for talking about all the 9-11 incidents that was created by the government.
[01:03:49.862 --> 01:03:50.503]  Stay there.
[01:03:50.623 --> 01:03:51.123]  Just stay there.
[01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:57.541]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Blue State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.721 --> 01:04:02.145]  Blue State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.285 --> 01:04:06.668]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.708 --> 01:04:08.070]  The New World Order.
[01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:10.091]  We're good to go.
[01:04:35.289 --> 01:04:35.609]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:35.649 --> 01:04:36.990]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:52.902 --> 01:05:03.628]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:05:03.809 --> 01:05:11.393]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.653 --> 01:05:14.775]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[01:05:14.935 --> 01:05:15.375]  We're good to go.
[01:05:33.604 --> 01:05:39.567]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[01:05:39.787 --> 01:05:43.728]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:43.748 --> 01:05:44.329]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:52.842 --> 01:05:53.342]  We're good to go.
[01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:12.789]  We're good to go.
[01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:38.788]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:38.808 --> 01:06:40.389]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:14.858 --> 01:07:24.744]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, 8 minutes, 25 seconds into this second hour on this 24th day of May 2005.
[01:07:25.324 --> 01:07:26.745]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[01:07:27.361 --> 01:07:35.649]  We'll get to your calls, including the last caller we were talking to, Eric in California, who just can't believe what the New World Order is doing, has trouble dealing with it.
[01:07:35.989 --> 01:07:38.611]  We'll get to your call first, and then to others, let you finish up your points.
[01:07:39.932 --> 01:07:51.603]  I think it would be best for Dr. Dennis Cuddy to really tell us about himself briefly, and his books, which I'm actually now carrying one of his best books, Cover Up, concerning 9-11 and, of course, Iraq, an excellent book.
[01:07:52.814 --> 01:07:54.436]  But we'll tell you about that a little bit later.
[01:07:54.496 --> 01:07:56.678]  But Dr. Cuddy, good to have you back on with us.
[01:07:57.859 --> 01:07:58.399]  How are you doing?
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.802]  Oh, I'm hanging in there.
[01:08:00.822 --> 01:08:05.005]  You just had some major surgery, didn't you, a few months ago?
[01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:07.388]  Well, no, it's been a while ago.
[01:08:07.448 --> 01:08:10.390]  It's just that the condition will not improve.
[01:08:11.972 --> 01:08:16.456]  I can talk conversationally for a little bit, but not for any length of time.
[01:08:17.822 --> 01:08:25.829]  Well, you're a real national treasure, and I know we're going to keep you for an hour and 20 minutes, and that's grueling for you, but we appreciate it, sir.
[01:08:25.909 --> 01:08:31.074]  Tell us in a nutshell who Dr. Dennis Cuddy is and your journey to truth, finding out about the NWO.
[01:08:32.637 --> 01:08:40.044]  Well, it started a long time ago, I guess back supposedly in high school.
[01:08:41.045 --> 01:08:47.250]  What I found out was there was the first governor's school, as it was called in the nation.
[01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:48.291]  Carnegie had funded it.
[01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.675]  It was in the state that I'm in, and I was selected as one of these.
[01:08:53.376 --> 01:08:55.798]  You get the idea that they're promoting you for something.
[01:08:59.744 --> 01:09:06.510]  They started to not like questions that I was raised, and certain doors that had been opened suddenly closed.
[01:09:06.570 --> 01:09:10.814]  Nobody actually came up and said, you know, forget it, you're now not one of us.
[01:09:11.374 --> 01:09:26.307]  But you got the clear indication of what was going on, and so by this time I had gotten into graduate school, and this was about 35 years ago, and reading the Muckrakers, who were the original investigative reporters, I guess around 100 or so years ago,
[01:09:27.433 --> 01:09:34.683]  And you find out from them certain things like who was really behind John D. Rockefeller.
[01:09:35.524 --> 01:09:42.073]  There was sort of a person that was running him actually called Henry Rogers.
[01:09:43.054 --> 01:09:45.617]  That was much more feared by the masses.
[01:09:45.637 --> 01:09:48.899]  Tied into British money, as usual.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:10:00.049]  Yeah, and they had agents in every hamlet of the United States to see who they could use and fund and help up the ladder and make members of Congress or whatever.
[01:10:00.349 --> 01:10:03.852]  And so from there, it just became a puzzle.
[01:10:04.092 --> 01:10:08.336]  And then I got myself into the federal government, the Department of Education, where I saw that
[01:10:09.296 --> 01:10:10.957]  There was like a revolving door.
[01:10:12.999 --> 01:10:19.504]  When their type of person was in the presidency, they flooded to the federal government and put millions of dollars into their cause.
[01:10:19.544 --> 01:10:26.489]  Then when their person was not in, they'd go back to these foundations, Carnegie, Rockefeller, Ford, and do basically the same thing.
[01:10:28.991 --> 01:10:30.291]  I got some experience with them.
[01:10:30.692 --> 01:10:36.296]  All during this time, I was collecting material, private papers, documents, diaries, whatever.
[01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:42.572]  And finally, piecing together this puzzle that shows there really is this power elite which is running things.
[01:10:42.932 --> 01:10:49.719]  Now, again, this is from naval historical societies in England.
[01:10:49.759 --> 01:10:51.420]  It's from their own autobiographies.
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:51.841]  It's from...
[01:10:52.601 --> 01:10:53.822]  The Library of Congress.
[01:10:53.902 --> 01:10:54.983]  It's from Georgetown.
[01:10:55.003 --> 01:10:56.905]  I mean, this stuff's public.
[01:10:57.285 --> 01:10:59.307]  World leaders saying we want world government.
[01:10:59.367 --> 01:11:00.508]  You're going to be our slaves.
[01:11:00.568 --> 01:11:02.149]  And that's really the end of it.
[01:11:02.710 --> 01:11:07.354]  Now, ten years ago, especially 20, 30 years ago, but ten years ago when I got involved in the fight...
[01:11:08.194 --> 01:11:16.176]  You can read their documents, but if you talk about the CFR, Trilateral Commission, they'd even say it didn't exist in the news, and it's a code word for racism if you say it.
[01:11:16.717 --> 01:11:18.177]  The Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[01:11:18.297 --> 01:11:21.638]  Now CNN comes out and goes, yeah, they want world government, but it's good.
[01:11:21.658 --> 01:11:26.179]  And the New York Times says, yes, they basically pick our presidents, but it's good.
[01:11:26.199 --> 01:11:29.020]  And world government is good.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.321]  And people that are against it are evil.
[01:11:31.821 --> 01:11:54.211]  And then Reuters comes out last Friday and says we want to get rid of the borders and have a Pan-American Union run by the United Nations, and yes, foreign troops are training here to deal with domestic threats, and it's all wonderful, and we're building emergency FEMA centers, and oh, it's so glorious, and we're going to have national ID cards, and swipe them to buy and sell, and we are going to register your guns, and we are going to... I mean, it's just...
[01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:57.973]  Now, it's getting worse every week, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:11:57.993 --> 01:11:58.694]  I'm sure you've noticed.
[01:11:58.734 --> 01:12:05.338]  It's just now that they have unleashed hell itself, and they are really moving at warp speed right now.
[01:12:06.864 --> 01:12:09.265]  Yeah, that's what at least one H.G.
[01:12:09.305 --> 01:12:12.947]  Wells of the sort of power elite said in his volumes.
[01:12:12.967 --> 01:12:18.250]  He said toward the end, the process would speed up, and he said many would die protesting the New World Order.
[01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:21.591]  And again, he wrote a lot of nonfiction.
[01:12:21.651 --> 01:12:25.033]  He was a futurist and a eugenics lord of the globalists.
[01:12:26.193 --> 01:12:31.856]  Yeah, most people know him for Time Machine and things like that, but he was one of the original...
[01:12:32.863 --> 01:12:33.523]  Individuals.
[01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:36.744]  Before he used the term New World Order, he called it the New Republic.
[01:12:36.804 --> 01:12:40.105]  He'd say they would have a cause that would make killing us worth the while.
[01:12:40.185 --> 01:12:42.825]  He was kind of a propagandist for Cecil Rhodes, was he not?
[01:12:45.286 --> 01:12:45.746]  Somewhat.
[01:12:45.806 --> 01:12:48.326]  There's like three different elements that network.
[01:12:48.406 --> 01:12:49.886]  You had H.G.
[01:12:49.946 --> 01:12:51.687]  Wells and the Fabian Socialists.
[01:12:51.827 --> 01:12:52.907]  Interlocking directorates.
[01:12:52.947 --> 01:12:53.267]  Right.
[01:12:53.307 --> 01:12:57.268]  Who worked with the Rhodes people, who in turn worked with the Skull and Bones people.
[01:12:57.308 --> 01:12:57.468]  Yeah.
[01:12:58.616 --> 01:13:08.141]  So what do we say to everybody who... Now, they're still simultaneously, literally, saying it doesn't exist when we talk about it, but then openly saying it does exist and it's good.
[01:13:08.461 --> 01:13:12.043]  So we're actually seeing mass psychosis double-think right now.
[01:13:13.423 --> 01:13:20.747]  Yeah, they have one particular message that they want the great unwashed, the masses who are supposed to be
[01:13:21.448 --> 01:13:24.290]  Under them, they see themselves as the philosopher kings.
[01:13:24.510 --> 01:13:34.938]  That is, if you talk about these things that you're a conspiracy nut and what they're going to do is say you have a mental health problem which needs treatment, they'll brand you.
[01:13:35.198 --> 01:13:44.584]  But to their own people, to the elite themselves, they'll admit in their meetings and publications that, yeah, there is a power elite and they want everything.
[01:13:45.065 --> 01:13:51.029]  Like you said, it's been in the Washington Post and CFR publications and on PBS television.
[01:13:51.724 --> 01:13:56.228]  Les Gelb was president of the CFR, basically said that on the Charlie Rose Show one night.
[01:13:56.248 --> 01:14:02.153]  He said, yeah, I talk about the New World Order all the time, and as president of the CFR, I want to get our people in key positions to run this stuff.
[01:14:04.635 --> 01:14:16.486]  And so they can say it on PBS with millions watching, knowing, though, that 99% of the public doesn't, and so they can even put it in newspapers, magazines, but they know the general public doesn't read that.
[01:14:17.446 --> 01:14:17.666]  Right.
[01:14:17.706 --> 01:14:19.488]  They've dumbed the general public down.
[01:14:19.628 --> 01:14:20.708]  That's deliberate as well.
[01:14:20.728 --> 01:14:21.088]  Oh, you're right.
[01:14:21.129 --> 01:14:22.049]  They couldn't read that.
[01:14:22.089 --> 01:14:22.489]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:23.310]  They're unable to.
[01:14:24.150 --> 01:14:29.954]  Well, that and they keep them occupied with inane soap operas and sitcoms and the like.
[01:14:30.194 --> 01:14:30.314]  Yeah.
[01:14:30.334 --> 01:14:35.017]  In fact, let's talk about Desperate Housewives instead of The Future of Our Children and This Country and Our Souls.
[01:14:36.277 --> 01:14:36.778]  Absolutely.
[01:14:36.818 --> 01:14:39.880]  That's part of the program process.
[01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.521]  It does several things.
[01:14:41.821 --> 01:14:43.842]  It's not just a psychological conditioning program.
[01:14:44.648 --> 01:14:54.666]  There's a technique called snapping where once you get people into that mindset, that becomes their intelligence level and they really...
[01:14:55.835 --> 01:14:59.459]  If you try to talk to them about anything else.
[01:14:59.479 --> 01:15:17.019]  They talk about in their documents, and you were at the Department of Education like Charlotte Iserby, who was the number two position there, and she has a phone book-sized book of documents where they openly talk about it, but it's really about freezing the mental state at about 13, 14 in an adolescent stupor, and then also creating it where they just regurgitate whatever they're told.
[01:15:18.611 --> 01:15:37.266]  Yeah, there was a letter, a memo that she uncovered and we circulated back in the mid-80s that Terrell Bell, who was head of the Department of Education at the time when she and I were there, sent a letter out to Leland Burningham, head of Utah's department, said we're going to put what they called outcome-based education in place.
[01:15:38.172 --> 01:15:42.496]  Which really was a sort of process for dumbing the children down.
[01:15:43.717 --> 01:15:46.960]  They say we're going to have more depth, but cover fewer subjects.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:51.244]  And, of course, if you leave gaps out of anything, then the kids are just dumbed down.
[01:15:51.324 --> 01:15:52.305]  Yeah, I've noticed.
[01:15:52.345 --> 01:15:53.666]  I mean, we've had generations of this.
[01:15:53.786 --> 01:15:55.868]  Adults now, and especially young people...
[01:15:57.009 --> 01:16:01.854]  Either they're more awake than ever, or they beat the programming, because that always happens in nature.
[01:16:02.214 --> 01:16:03.075]  That's God's system.
[01:16:03.215 --> 01:16:16.507]  Or they're totally enthralled by it, but they always want to talk about things individually, and even in that individual discussion to the limited data they were given, they don't have what I call full spectrum analysis and the interconnecting panorama.
[01:16:17.576 --> 01:16:20.778]  They're unable to grasp large concepts.
[01:16:21.558 --> 01:16:22.019]  That's right.
[01:16:22.059 --> 01:16:30.443]  The change was deliberate from what they call cognitive basics, reading, writing, math, to affective, how do you feel about these things.
[01:16:30.944 --> 01:16:35.066]  And so what they've been conditioned to do is live in a world of cliches.
[01:16:35.846 --> 01:16:42.570]  For example, if you say something to them about abortion or whatever, it doesn't matter, they'll say, well, don't impose your morality on me.
[01:16:43.177 --> 01:16:48.400]  And that's where their brain comes to a screeching halt, not realizing that that's what laws are.
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:52.702]  They have a prepackaged little node they spit out that they associate with being smart.
[01:16:53.463 --> 01:17:04.829]  That's right, but most of the time it doesn't even make sense because if you ask them, well, aren't most of our laws based on some sort of imposition of thou shalt not steal, thou shalt not kill, they say, well, yeah, I guess so.
[01:17:04.929 --> 01:17:06.810]  But they don't get to that level.
[01:17:08.391 --> 01:17:12.073]  Or they take you trying to warn them as some type of uppity insult.
[01:17:13.738 --> 01:17:21.121]  Yeah, you're being judgmental, you're looking down your nose at them, and they're just as good as you are in their ignorance, yes.
[01:17:23.161 --> 01:17:24.102]  It's unbelievable.
[01:17:24.122 --> 01:17:25.942]  I mean, these people will make jokes.
[01:17:27.363 --> 01:17:32.324]  I mean, you know, the example is, one of the classics is, you're a black helicopter person.
[01:17:32.344 --> 01:17:33.845]  I was on this radio show and I said, look,
[01:17:34.492 --> 01:17:35.293]  I did cover it.
[01:17:35.313 --> 01:17:41.216]  It was on the front page of the Austin American States when they tried to bribe the police chief and did all this urban warfare training.
[01:17:41.897 --> 01:17:45.019]  I mean, are you saying we don't have this military shadow government taking over?
[01:17:45.059 --> 01:17:45.939]  I'm sure you've heard about it.
[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:49.962]  And they go, well, yeah, that's going on, but I'm still saying you're a kook to be against it.
[01:17:49.982 --> 01:17:56.166]  Yeah, and if you try to get on Rush Limbaugh and say anything like that, he'll call you a kook as well.
[01:17:56.186 --> 01:17:57.387]  He has this little kook test.
[01:17:58.207 --> 01:18:02.750]  But what I try to do in some of my books is show how, actually...
[01:18:03.571 --> 01:18:07.073]  Some of the other stuff he says is basically right.
[01:18:07.754 --> 01:18:18.040]  There's one quote where he says, if you amount to anything, you have to be a good Kennedy School of Government type and you're hand-picked and plucked and you're put in certain positions and so forth and so on.
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:26.426]  So even Rush himself is describing sort of what we're talking about, but if you come on or I come on and say something like that, he'll say we're nuts, a kook.
[01:18:26.846 --> 01:18:30.568]  Well, what they do is they give you a lot of the truth but then add bad solutions.
[01:18:31.529 --> 01:18:31.709]  Yeah.
[01:18:32.876 --> 01:18:33.236]  That's right.
[01:18:33.917 --> 01:18:36.219]  I mean, that's another... It's sophisticated, folks.
[01:18:36.279 --> 01:18:39.321]  I mean, the elite's in power because they're slick.
[01:18:40.242 --> 01:18:40.642]  That's right.
[01:18:40.662 --> 01:18:41.223]  Slick Willie.
[01:18:42.464 --> 01:18:43.985]  And it's time to stop being fooled.
[01:18:44.025 --> 01:18:46.307]  I mean, I'm sorry I'm telling you you've been ripped off.
[01:18:46.787 --> 01:18:49.270]  You can judge the messenger if you want, or you can wake up.
[01:18:49.750 --> 01:18:50.511]  Stay there, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:18:50.531 --> 01:18:51.912]  I want to talk about a lot of other issues.
[01:18:53.539 --> 01:18:57.603]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[01:19:54.648 --> 01:19:55.689]  The war on terrorism.
[01:19:56.009 --> 01:19:58.812]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:19:59.072 --> 01:20:03.236]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:20:03.656 --> 01:20:04.477]  So what do you do?
[01:20:04.798 --> 01:20:09.382]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:20:09.862 --> 01:20:11.984]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:20:12.464 --> 01:20:27.175]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:20:41.263 --> 01:20:41.463]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:53.041 --> 01:20:56.725]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:20:57.125 --> 01:21:02.550]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:21:03.011 --> 01:21:08.156]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:21:08.816 --> 01:21:22.123]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:21:22.623 --> 01:21:27.926]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:21:28.246 --> 01:21:34.129]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:21:34.753 --> 01:21:34.813]  1-800-686-2237
[01:21:52.268 --> 01:21:56.854]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's Liquid Quell.
[01:21:57.114 --> 01:22:05.544]  Doctor-recommended, safe, effective, affordable cholesterol control, available now at major wholesale clubs everywhere, without a prescription.
[01:22:05.764 --> 01:22:07.466]  Here's Dr. Sherry Rainwater, M.D.,
[01:22:08.087 --> 01:22:13.332]  I recommend Quell to my patients because it's been shown to be effective and safe in reducing cholesterol.
[01:22:13.492 --> 01:22:19.797]  Quell is an easy way to improve your cholesterol profile without serious side effects in as little as six months, guaranteed.
[01:22:20.078 --> 01:22:24.321]  And Quell is safe for diabetics, gluten-free, and safe to take with prescriptions.
[01:22:24.522 --> 01:22:26.183]  Here's Cheryl Gee in California.
[01:22:26.403 --> 01:22:32.909]  Quell lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days, something I couldn't do with diet and exercise in two to three years.
[01:22:33.169 --> 01:22:39.733]  Gentle, fast-acting liquid quail is available at major wholesale clubs nationwide and online at quaildirect.com.
[01:22:39.873 --> 01:22:43.476]  Quail your cholesterol today, risk-free and guaranteed.
[01:22:43.956 --> 01:22:46.798]  These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
[01:22:46.918 --> 01:22:50.120]  Quail is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.521]  Individual results may vary.
[01:23:06.047 --> 01:23:07.668]  We're talking to Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[01:23:07.688 --> 01:23:09.690]  Your calls are coming up later in the show.
[01:23:10.931 --> 01:23:16.276]  I've got a lot of pertinent news items from the last few days, and I want to get his take on as well.
[01:23:16.296 --> 01:23:19.418]  That way we can have our great guests on and also cover news at the same time.
[01:23:20.199 --> 01:23:33.370]  Dr. Cuddy, I mean, for those that don't understand the whole false left-right system of how the elite comes in, socializes the country to consolidate the wealth of the people, to get them dependent...
[01:23:34.582 --> 01:23:34.802]  I mean...
[01:23:52.458 --> 01:24:00.224]  It's really hard once they've bought into apparently what a lot of them have bought into, and that's the sort of lesser of two evils.
[01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:13.395]  They won't call him that, but I would say you really can't look at it any other way, given that even before George Bush ran in 2000, he had enough of an indication of
[01:24:16.395 --> 01:24:23.579]  For example, I think down in Texas there was an individual, a woman who had become a Christian after she was in prison.
[01:24:23.599 --> 01:24:38.266]  The warden said she was a model prisoner and Bush had no problem with executing her while at the same time commuting to life since a homosexual who had brutally murdered the little child of America's Most Wanted's host and so on.
[01:24:38.886 --> 01:24:44.049]  And yet the American public did that and of course once he got into office he had his federal
[01:24:44.916 --> 01:24:51.657]  Well, he also made fun of the woman and said, please don't kill me, please, and got off on her.
[01:24:51.717 --> 01:25:13.361]  Yeah, and then once he gets in, of course, he almost immediately does something that Clinton never did, which is have the federal forces go into Pastor Greg Dixon's church there in Indiana and grab him and some of the parishioners and seize the church property and so on and point homosexuals to various prominent positions and ambassadorships and
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:23.829]  Put up what he called the one-finger salute in front of a TV camera after a sports event.
[01:25:23.849 --> 01:25:27.593]  A lot of things that you just wouldn't associate with being a, quote, good Christian.
[01:25:28.377 --> 01:25:30.800]  But the people overlook that sort of stuff.
[01:25:30.881 --> 01:25:37.409]  Well, he also rewarded the Attorney General of Alabama with a federal judgeship, the guy that went after Roy Moore.
[01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:39.091]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:25:39.331 --> 01:25:45.139]  So-called Christians will tell you that Bush fought for Judge Roy Moore and call you a devil if you tell them the truth.
[01:25:46.374 --> 01:25:47.995]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:25:48.175 --> 01:25:53.898]  Judge Pryor was one of his nominees that's up for Senate confirmation.
[01:25:54.298 --> 01:26:03.804]  He says he really likes Ozzy Osbourne's music, like Bloody Sabbath and Facing Hell, which has demonic parts to it, occultic.
[01:26:03.844 --> 01:26:07.346]  Well, he also likes to pray at Shinto shrines, pray to Allah.
[01:26:07.886 --> 01:26:09.507]  I mean, he's a jock of all trades.
[01:26:10.387 --> 01:26:16.811]  Yeah, so, bottom line, I don't see how a person could say, well, he's a good Christian.
[01:26:16.831 --> 01:26:20.593]  What they'll basically say is, yeah, but, you know, he's better than Kerry.
[01:26:20.633 --> 01:26:23.375]  And, of course, like you said, that's sort of a controlled opposition thing.
[01:26:23.415 --> 01:26:24.856]  Both were Skull and Bones members.
[01:26:25.776 --> 01:26:27.998]  Both are cousins, but, I mean, look at the facts here.
[01:26:28.598 --> 01:26:30.039]  Look at the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:26:30.928 --> 01:26:32.529]  Bush is for total open borders.
[01:26:32.569 --> 01:26:53.523]  He's appointing all these pro-abortion people, anti-gun people, increases UNESCO funding, signs back onto this UN control arm system, and it's just right out in the open, and the guy's skull and bones Bohemian Grove, and he's getting more through than a Democrat could ever get through because he's a Trojan horse.
[01:26:54.562 --> 01:26:56.583]  Well, that's one of their typical things.
[01:26:56.823 --> 01:27:01.146]  It's more, when they got Nixon in, he was supposed to be one of these real right-wing types.
[01:27:01.246 --> 01:27:03.668]  Price controls, just endless.
[01:27:03.808 --> 01:27:05.649]  Opened the door to Communist China.
[01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:13.994]  Had that Joint Commission on Mental Health that basically said churches were going downhill and the state needs to step in and raise your children for you.
[01:27:14.895 --> 01:27:18.017]  And he said he was becoming a Keynesian in economics.
[01:27:18.097 --> 01:27:19.398]  That's the Fabian Socialists.
[01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:22.900]  That's what Nixon told Howard K. Smith, ABC reporter at the time.
[01:27:23.422 --> 01:27:33.068]  So they usually make a lot of progress under these so-called conservatives, because like you said, it's a left-right dialectic that they're about, and the people are confused by it.
[01:27:34.329 --> 01:27:43.154]  Well, right now, even liberal groups are admitting there's gun registration in this new expansion of the Patriot Act, but most gun owners aren't even aware of it.
[01:27:43.854 --> 01:27:46.016]  Or they'll say, well, I'll just register my guns then.
[01:27:46.076 --> 01:27:49.598]  It's conservative, and you're a liberal because you're against gun registration.
[01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:55.451]  Yeah, and the Real ID Act that just passed, it basically is a national ID.
[01:27:55.471 --> 01:28:02.454]  It doesn't matter that individual states have their driver's licenses with that name on it, you know, Nevada, Texas, wherever.
[01:28:02.474 --> 01:28:03.414]  It federalizes them.
[01:28:04.134 --> 01:28:04.754]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:04.814 --> 01:28:12.537]  And then David Dreyer wants to go even further than that, where you would have this encrypted sort of microchip that they'd be able to track you all over the place.
[01:28:12.697 --> 01:28:14.137]  And they've got that power in the new bill.
[01:28:14.177 --> 01:28:14.717]  It's funny, though.
[01:28:14.737 --> 01:28:18.498]  Dreyer didn't have to leave office like the governor of New Jersey.
[01:28:18.538 --> 01:28:20.059]  See, it's also a double standard.
[01:28:21.211 --> 01:28:26.134]  Yeah, and maybe after the break, I hear the music, we can go into how they track you.
[01:28:27.594 --> 01:28:29.495]  We'll be right back with Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[01:28:29.555 --> 01:28:32.477]  We'll also take calls at 800-259-9231.
[01:28:32.497 --> 01:28:38.100]  Let Dr. Cuddy get a glass of water, and we'll be right back.
[01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:42.522]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.683 --> 01:28:44.603]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.063 --> 01:28:46.684]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.584 --> 01:28:50.286]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.972 --> 01:28:56.474]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:28:57.134 --> 01:29:03.798]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:29:04.978 --> 01:29:07.260]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:29:08.060 --> 01:29:14.304]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[01:29:15.204 --> 01:29:23.269]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[01:29:24.312 --> 01:29:32.176]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:33.017 --> 01:29:34.558]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[01:29:34.578 --> 01:29:34.958]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:29:34.978 --> 01:29:35.458]  Call now.
[01:29:35.478 --> 01:29:39.461]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:29:53.504 --> 01:29:55.145]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.265 --> 01:29:59.349]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.509 --> 01:30:02.391]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.471 --> 01:30:09.197]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.357 --> 01:30:12.379]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.579 --> 01:30:14.981]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.101 --> 01:30:22.988]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:30:23.268 --> 01:30:25.229]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:53.638 --> 01:30:57.060]  Pope John Paul II is already being acclaimed a saint.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:31:00.863]  During his 26 years, he canonized 482 saints.
[01:31:01.043 --> 01:31:07.087]  The one saint that stands out in my mind is Saint Maria Faustina, a poor, uneducated Polish nun.
[01:31:07.327 --> 01:31:14.412]  Christ appeared to her over 100 times in the 1930s and instructed her to keep a diary of the message he wanted to give to the world.
[01:31:14.552 --> 01:31:18.395]  This message is nothing new, just a reminder of what the Church has always taught.
[01:31:18.695 --> 01:31:22.458]  I'm offering you a free booklet so that you too can learn more about Divine Mercy.
[01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:43.154]  I'm down in Austin, Texas from the networks up in Minneapolis-St.
[01:31:43.214 --> 01:31:43.474]  Paul.
[01:32:07.356 --> 01:32:16.760]  And John, who's running the broadcast, said last night on Fox TV, they showed Cub Foods up in Minnesota, claiming they'd had instantly two million sign-ups.
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:17.860]  Total garbage.
[01:32:19.561 --> 01:32:31.286]  For thumb scanning, why you thumb scan to make sure there's no identity theft to keep you safe, and now because they've been instantly beating the drum of identity theft, why now you've got to do this?
[01:32:32.106 --> 01:32:35.448]  Well, for right now, it's not we don't make you, but we recommend you do.
[01:32:36.528 --> 01:32:41.269]  The tanning salons, the gyms, the public school, school lunches, no cash allowed.
[01:32:41.309 --> 01:32:43.290]  Thousands of school districts now.
[01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:47.671]  They get library books at city libraries, school libraries.
[01:32:48.331 --> 01:32:49.451]  It's for your safety.
[01:32:49.751 --> 01:32:53.192]  Meanwhile, it's the credit card company selling your data, causing this to happen.
[01:32:53.872 --> 01:32:56.312]  Bank of America sold the data to a fake company.
[01:32:57.053 --> 01:33:00.113]  They're the ones 90% of the time literally outdoing it.
[01:33:00.533 --> 01:33:02.994]  Big report out from New York Daily News.
[01:33:03.897 --> 01:33:11.124]  Without the government issuing and using social security numbers as IDs has actually caused all this, their answer will now be more.
[01:33:11.144 --> 01:33:14.206]  When he's trying to find that newscast online, he saw it.
[01:33:14.667 --> 01:33:16.949]  John, do you want to turn the mic on and tell us about what you saw?
[01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:18.130]  Yeah, sure.
[01:33:18.390 --> 01:33:18.991]  Can you hear me okay?
[01:33:19.411 --> 01:33:20.072]  I can hear you great.
[01:33:20.092 --> 01:33:21.133]  What did you see last night?
[01:33:21.753 --> 01:33:22.454]  Actually, it wasn't last night.
[01:33:22.474 --> 01:33:23.415]  It was about a week ago.
[01:33:23.455 --> 01:33:24.836]  Okay, you just told me the other night.
[01:33:25.096 --> 01:33:30.141]  Yeah, and I guess it's grocery stores locally here, and they're implementing this.
[01:33:34.317 --> 01:33:41.762]  But that sounds like pure propaganda.
[01:33:41.802 --> 01:33:44.304]  Two million, got it, everyone loves it, come get it!
[01:33:44.644 --> 01:33:46.065]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:33:46.105 --> 01:33:47.226]  But see, it's here, folks.
[01:33:47.706 --> 01:33:48.247]  It's happening.
[01:33:48.267 --> 01:33:49.408]  What did you think of that newscast?
[01:33:49.908 --> 01:33:51.009]  I thought it was total bunk.
[01:33:52.407 --> 01:33:55.168]  And, of course, it was Texas back in 93, sort of thumb scanning.
[01:33:55.188 --> 01:33:56.069]  Most states already do it.
[01:33:56.429 --> 01:33:59.190]  Now, under federal standardization, it's going in in the next two years.
[01:33:59.550 --> 01:34:01.511]  This will be part of the new national sales tax.
[01:34:02.051 --> 01:34:02.872]  Anything else, John?
[01:34:03.772 --> 01:34:04.172]  No, that's it.
[01:34:04.712 --> 01:34:05.573]  You're doing a great job.
[01:34:05.753 --> 01:34:06.013]  All right.
[01:34:06.033 --> 01:34:06.693]  Thank you, my friend.
[01:34:06.753 --> 01:34:08.394]  Dr. Cuddy, what do you think of them apples?
[01:34:08.434 --> 01:34:12.536]  I wanted to dovetail that with your discussion of the new tracker chips to go in the cards.
[01:34:13.923 --> 01:34:21.406]  Yeah, they've had piloting and stuff like that in European stores, in certain stores for a while.
[01:34:22.606 --> 01:34:26.648]  Basically, they try these things out before they spring it on us.
[01:34:27.448 --> 01:34:36.091]  They've had what's called a neural chip implant that they've already experimented on in Soledad Prison, where they get not only an audio but a visual record of everything.
[01:34:36.758 --> 01:34:43.739]  That the person does and they can cause them to back off, be more amenable to orders and so forth.
[01:34:43.779 --> 01:34:57.542]  About 20 years ago, Britain's Experimental Whitehall Institute developed a similar system where they could monitor brain waves and they could prevent you.
[01:34:57.582 --> 01:35:04.723]  If you had a thought, let's say you had a thought of doing something criminal, they could give you an electrical shock that would prevent you from doing that.
[01:35:05.473 --> 01:35:20.025]  And in my film Road to Tyranny, I have them on CBS News saying all this, and now with these new implants that go into the sciatic nerve, for depression, they're guaranteed if they're ordering hundreds of thousands of people on drugs every year, they're going to order people on this as well.
[01:35:20.045 --> 01:35:27.190]  And for those that don't believe this, Andy Rooney said, we all need chips to prove we're good people.
[01:35:27.611 --> 01:35:28.892]  He said this on 60 Minutes.
[01:35:29.412 --> 01:35:31.013]  He said it with a straight face.
[01:35:31.154 --> 01:35:32.775]  This is what they want, Dr. Cuddy!
[01:35:33.849 --> 01:35:39.191]  Yeah, and they can basically track you.
[01:35:39.211 --> 01:35:42.292]  There's an outfit called Checkpoint Systems.
[01:35:43.232 --> 01:35:49.574]  And let's say Alex Jones goes to Portland, Oregon.
[01:35:50.434 --> 01:35:57.357]  When you walk through a store, those little screeners at the end, if you have that little barcode on something that you've purchased or whatever.
[01:35:57.397 --> 01:35:59.077]  For example, Japanese tennis shoes.
[01:35:59.097 --> 01:36:01.498]  They're made in the U.S., but they have this stuff in the shoe.
[01:36:02.179 --> 01:36:13.548]  And if the kid, there's a lot of Japanese kids wearing them, if they walk through, let's say, a store in Tokyo, they're immediately registered that that particular individual child is just at that location.
[01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:16.571]  So they can track, you know, wherever you go like that.
[01:36:17.271 --> 01:36:21.015]  And then they've gotten to the point where it's like your thoughts.
[01:36:21.755 --> 01:36:24.037]  For example, I think the outfit's called Cyberkinetics.
[01:36:24.057 --> 01:36:25.178]  They're up in Massachusetts.
[01:36:25.738 --> 01:36:29.361]  But anyway, if you have, there's this little chip.
[01:36:29.401 --> 01:36:31.243]  It's about the size of a penny.
[01:36:31.767 --> 01:36:33.328]  And it's in the base of the brain.
[01:36:33.548 --> 01:36:36.570]  And what you do is, it's linked up to a computer system.
[01:36:37.211 --> 01:36:40.112]  And so you think, I want that door open.
[01:36:40.173 --> 01:36:41.493]  Let's say your front door opens.
[01:36:41.553 --> 01:36:43.715]  You just think that, and the door opens.
[01:36:44.155 --> 01:36:45.716]  It sends a signal to the computer.
[01:36:45.756 --> 01:36:47.317]  The computer then opens the door.
[01:36:47.837 --> 01:36:51.560]  So all you have to do is think something, and an action occurs.
[01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:55.743]  Which, of course, opens up the possibility of somebody hacking in.
[01:36:56.103 --> 01:36:56.883]  Let me say this.
[01:36:57.043 --> 01:36:59.205]  I had the police chief of Burgum County...
[01:37:01.026 --> 01:37:05.649]  ...from New Jersey a few weeks ago, and he's gotten the applied digital chip.
[01:37:06.229 --> 01:37:08.151]  And I said, well, the government orders us to take it.
[01:37:08.171 --> 01:37:09.051]  Will you enforce that?
[01:37:09.091 --> 01:37:09.732]  Is that a good idea?
[01:37:09.752 --> 01:37:12.414]  And he said, yes, we should all have the chip.
[01:37:14.315 --> 01:37:20.400]  I've had their other executives on, and they said the chip will prevail, and weird statements like this, get chip today.
[01:37:21.776 --> 01:37:26.299]  I mean, there's so many of the Mexican Attorney General making his people get it.
[01:37:26.959 --> 01:37:28.821]  I mean, they're not joking around.
[01:37:28.881 --> 01:37:30.942]  They're not playing games.
[01:37:31.002 --> 01:37:41.669]  And Aldous Huxley gave a speech in 1962 before he died at Berkeley where he said he'd visited British labs in 1960 where they were already remote controlling people.
[01:37:43.196 --> 01:37:47.179]  Yeah, and they've had fast experiments with little mice, too.
[01:37:47.199 --> 01:37:49.942]  They can cause them to turn left, right, do whatever.
[01:37:50.702 --> 01:37:57.348]  Edward Cornish was head of the World Futures Society a decade or so ago in the Chicago Tribune.
[01:37:57.368 --> 01:38:04.154]  They were interviewing him, and the way he put it was, what they try to do first is get you to, quote, voluntarily do something.
[01:38:04.756 --> 01:38:10.661]  And so the way it'll probably come back, it's not so much the police saying, I'm ordering you to lay on this operation table.
[01:38:10.681 --> 01:38:12.222]  We're going to put a chip in you or something like that.
[01:38:12.743 --> 01:38:26.554]  What they'll probably do is like an economic incentive, like your boss will say, now you do understand that so you don't get kidnapped by some terrorist, we need to have this little chip in you so we can locate you and say, okay, boss, sure, for my job, I'll do it.
[01:38:27.055 --> 01:38:28.136]  And then they'll go from there.
[01:38:28.196 --> 01:38:32.920]  They'll be able to monitor you through the chip and cause you to do this, that, and the other through the chip and so on.
[01:38:35.987 --> 01:38:37.127]  You're absolutely right.
[01:38:38.488 --> 01:38:40.508]  And they're also pitching it as a fad.
[01:38:41.309 --> 01:38:43.589]  You'll get all these economic discounts when you have it.
[01:38:43.609 --> 01:38:45.210]  I mean, folks, we're not joking.
[01:38:45.250 --> 01:38:49.651]  It's already going to be in your ID cards, which is bad enough.
[01:38:50.051 --> 01:38:51.192]  That's now going in.
[01:38:51.212 --> 01:38:53.552]  Yeah, and your Social Security requirements.
[01:38:54.293 --> 01:38:55.993]  They'll make it seem like you want it.
[01:38:56.033 --> 01:38:59.334]  Like I said, whether you're talking about 9-11 or whatever it is,
[01:39:03.010 --> 01:39:05.911]  The power elite's control mechanism isn't so much direct.
[01:39:05.951 --> 01:39:07.572]  They like to have sort of plausible.
[01:39:08.732 --> 01:39:15.275]  So what they do is they create situations in which an individual or the public in general says, oh my goodness, we have to have more gun control.
[01:39:15.295 --> 01:39:17.056]  Look at all those school shootings or whatever.
[01:39:17.076 --> 01:39:18.856]  That's their main tactic.
[01:39:18.957 --> 01:39:20.217]  Well, I'll never forget on December 29th.
[01:39:21.417 --> 01:39:23.718]  No, it was December 31st, 2000.
[01:39:23.798 --> 01:39:25.879]  No, no, no, 1999.
[01:39:25.919 --> 01:39:26.379]  I was watching...
[01:39:33.741 --> 01:39:46.570]  Wall Street Week in Review, when Louis Rukeyser was still doing it, and the head of Sun Microsystems, I think it's McKelvey, I forget his exact name, but he's on there.
[01:39:47.811 --> 01:39:51.074]  And Rukeyser says, what do you look most forward to in the new millennium?
[01:39:52.335 --> 01:39:53.796]  And he said, this is a quote,
[01:39:54.506 --> 01:40:01.971]  I look forward to implanting my son Maverick with a chip so I can track and trace everything he does.
[01:40:02.392 --> 01:40:04.393]  If he's driving a little too fast, I'll know.
[01:40:04.413 --> 01:40:06.735]  Or if he's not studying, I'll know.
[01:40:07.155 --> 01:40:10.237]  I look forward to chipping my young son Maverick.
[01:40:12.419 --> 01:40:13.840]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.922]  They're linking GPS technology as well.
[01:40:17.182 --> 01:40:19.043]  That's the way you can really track anybody.
[01:40:19.083 --> 01:40:20.484]  They just bought the company to do that.
[01:40:20.504 --> 01:40:21.225]  Applied Digital did.
[01:40:21.884 --> 01:40:22.144]  Right.
[01:40:22.304 --> 01:40:27.147]  And so they've had devices where you can sort of locate somebody within a city.
[01:40:28.208 --> 01:40:30.929]  Devices, you know, they can read through walls and all this sort of stuff.
[01:40:30.969 --> 01:40:35.492]  But once they link it up, like I said, Checkpoint Systems is the one that's sort of leading the edge of this.
[01:40:36.052 --> 01:40:39.454]  That way they can, with GPS technology, find you wherever you are.
[01:40:42.836 --> 01:40:47.599]  Man, I tell you, they just relentlessly in the TV shows, the dramas.
[01:40:48.139 --> 01:40:49.860]  We're going to go to calls in a moment, but Dr. Cuddy,
[01:40:51.212 --> 01:41:11.879]  I've noticed that there's literally ten times the propaganda in dramas, in fictions, in cop shows, than there is even in the newscast itself, because that's what the majority of people are watching, and they're watching in a suspended disbelief, uncritical mentality, and so I guess just accepting all of it, can you speak to that?
[01:41:12.745 --> 01:41:16.354]  Well, they try, like I said, it's a conditioning process.
[01:41:16.694 --> 01:41:21.746]  We've talked in the past about Tavistock and their theory of social turbulence and all this sort of stuff.
[01:41:22.330 --> 01:41:47.229]  And so what they'll do is if you start to wise up to some of this and expose it and whatever, all of a sudden, out of the blue, you'll see a bunch of TV shows and movies that sort of push the envelope one additional step so that if there's a particular movie that's like a control mechanism and powerful forces beyond us manipulate, blah, blah, blah.
[01:41:47.469 --> 01:41:48.350]  You'll see all this stuff.
[01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:56.378]  And so therefore, when something relatively, quote, mild happens in actual real life, the public says, oh, well, you know, I've heard about that stuff.
[01:41:56.418 --> 01:41:57.079]  No big deal.
[01:41:57.219 --> 01:42:01.143]  Yeah, we're being desensitized, bathed, basted in this.
[01:42:01.964 --> 01:42:04.006]  Yeah, that's one of their tactics.
[01:42:04.066 --> 01:42:04.746]  It's sort of like that...
[01:42:05.922 --> 01:42:22.868]  Back in the 60s, there's the SDS movement, Radical, and the book came out, Strawberry Statement, by one of these fellows, James Coonan, and he said that this was at the time of the Chicago Convention, the Democratic Convention, you know, riots, and Mayor Daley and all this sort of stuff.
[01:42:23.549 --> 01:42:35.153]  And basically, the guy afterwards said, well, look, what happened was a bunch of business international roundtable types came in and tried to buy up a few Radicals, and they wanted to have us make a lot of commotion
[01:42:35.623 --> 01:42:47.795]  And appear even more radical than what they were planning for us, which then turned out to be like David Rockefeller saying how wonderful Mao Zedong was, and let's have trade with these ruthless communist Chinese, and so on.
[01:42:48.035 --> 01:42:59.627]  Yeah, the documents have also come out that at the very same time that Nixon later was actually planning to bomb conventions to go, oh, see, we're under attack.
[01:43:00.715 --> 01:43:04.118]  Well, that's Operation Northwoods.
[01:43:04.598 --> 01:43:12.505]  As you know, ten years before, they were willing to kill a bunch of Americans to try and justify and get a pretext for an invasion of Cuba.
[01:43:12.985 --> 01:43:14.526]  Sounds sort of like Iraq.
[01:43:15.347 --> 01:43:23.574]  If something works once, or at least the theory holds, that was put out by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, then something like that may happen again.
[01:43:23.594 --> 01:43:24.655]  Now, Dr. Cuddy...
[01:43:25.620 --> 01:43:27.181]  I want to go over Iraq a little bit.
[01:43:27.921 --> 01:43:29.502]  Tell us about your book, Cover Up.
[01:43:29.522 --> 01:43:30.643]  Give us the full title.
[01:43:30.683 --> 01:43:31.743]  By the way, I'm carrying this.
[01:43:32.183 --> 01:43:34.865]  It's up on the shopping cart, and you can also write to me and get it.
[01:43:36.165 --> 01:43:37.186]  Tell us about Cover Up.
[01:43:38.286 --> 01:43:39.707]  Okay.
[01:43:39.727 --> 01:43:41.628]  Briefly, it covers three main elements.
[01:43:41.708 --> 01:43:52.934]  There's the 9-11 situation and how that could have been easily prevented and how we sort of behind the scenes had been concocting, like I said, the paralegal scenario
[01:43:53.616 --> 01:44:03.259]  Is that when you talk about Macedonia or whatever, you go in, you stir stuff up, then somebody like Milosevic reacts and you say, oh my goodness, human rights violations, we have to go in and help the poor people.
[01:44:03.819 --> 01:44:09.560]  And so I do some of that and show how that led to 9-11, how they did the same sort of thing there.
[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:10.941]  It could have been easily prevented.
[01:44:11.721 --> 01:44:18.563]  And then the book is coming out just at the time the Iraq war is beginning and so in there
[01:44:19.102 --> 01:44:27.026]  One of the things I put is what Saddam's strategy would be, which, of course, the administration just blew it.
[01:44:27.066 --> 01:44:33.749]  They didn't see it was obviously going to be a guerrilla warfare, just like it is, and that costs many lives, and the press didn't even want to touch the thing.
[01:44:33.769 --> 01:44:44.874]  Although it was obvious, it goes to that, and then at the end it gets into how there are these violations of our constitutional rights as a result of this stuff, whether it's Patriot Act, Homeland Security, or whatever, and how there's this group
[01:44:45.713 --> 01:44:56.158]  The Project for the New American Century, as well as James Baker and CFR Institute, that sort of planned all this stuff in advance to get rid of Saddam, to get the oil from Central Asia, and so on.
[01:44:57.679 --> 01:45:01.401]  And again, folks, you can go to InfoWars.com to get cover up.
[01:45:01.441 --> 01:45:02.281]  It's an excellent book.
[01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:05.583]  Or you can write to me at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:45:15.311 --> 01:45:15.992]  And the book is $16.
[01:45:16.032 --> 01:45:20.015]  Again, 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, or InfoWars.com.
[01:45:20.135 --> 01:45:22.858]  Dr. Cuddy, the Pentagon told Bush it'd take 450,000 troops.
[01:45:23.198 --> 01:45:25.040]  They knew what was going to happen.
[01:45:34.176 --> 01:45:40.484]  Are you sure it's ivory tower altitude mental illness?
[01:45:40.685 --> 01:45:47.353]  Or do you think that it's part of a larger plan to make America look bad so the EU can play the part of the good cop?
[01:45:47.733 --> 01:45:50.136]  I mean, I think there's wheels within wheels here.
[01:45:50.517 --> 01:45:51.919]  And I read an Israeli paper.
[01:45:53.149 --> 01:46:06.018]  Written by one of their top generals in the early 80s saying we want to invade Iraq first and then never really fix it, destabilize it and break it up, but they really want it to be a smoking heap of ethnic and religious conflict.
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:14.902]  Yeah, there's various factions, even within the power elite, and they use this sort of dialectic as well.
[01:46:15.562 --> 01:46:20.864]  They create a situation where we go in, but we're not totally successful.
[01:46:20.984 --> 01:46:22.284]  Now, that does two things.
[01:46:22.344 --> 01:46:28.046]  Number one, it says, well, gee, maybe we should have relied on the EU, and after all, let's have the EU come in as
[01:46:28.886 --> 01:46:41.673]  And then now, regardless, global government is established because either you accept total inspectors, total control, and sanctions that are genocide, that's the good cop, or the bad cop is DU, nuclear attack, total takeover.
[01:46:42.794 --> 01:46:48.217]  And also, another part of it is, the more there is instability, the more reason...
[01:46:49.989 --> 01:46:54.895]  Like I said, they create a situation so you have a reaction, they use a reaction.
[01:46:54.935 --> 01:47:00.822]  So if you have instability, then the new Iraqi government says that their reaction is, oh, please don't leave.
[01:47:00.842 --> 01:47:02.424]  You know, stick around, Halliburton.
[01:47:02.564 --> 01:47:07.169]  Oh, please don't leave Iran and Syria are doing and invade them, please.
[01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:09.092]  Yeah, you want to send a signal.
[01:47:10.343 --> 01:47:12.484]  And then play off one against the other.
[01:47:13.085 --> 01:47:18.249]  You're centrally located between Iran on the east and Syria on the west, so you can go either way.
[01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:24.093]  You fulfill the PNAC cause of a, quote, permanent military presence in the region, which was their goal.
[01:47:24.113 --> 01:47:26.435]  They said Saddam was just incidental to that.
[01:47:26.976 --> 01:47:35.122]  You get a protection base for the oil coming from Central Asia, Uzbekistan and all this stuff at the same time.
[01:47:35.615 --> 01:47:39.597]  Poppy production increases just like it did during the Vietnam War.
[01:47:39.617 --> 01:47:40.738]  It explodes.
[01:47:40.838 --> 01:47:43.399]  It explodes out there.
[01:47:43.459 --> 01:47:44.740]  You have your people in place.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:48.902]  You have Karzai, a Unical consultant, the head of Afghanistan.
[01:47:48.942 --> 01:47:49.803]  You have the ambassador.
[01:47:50.171 --> 01:47:52.952]  Khalilzad was a UNICAL consultant as well.
[01:47:53.412 --> 01:47:55.273]  And so you have your key players in place.
[01:47:55.313 --> 01:48:01.876]  You protect through changing the law to say you can't... Sorry, I forget their law name.
[01:48:02.096 --> 01:48:12.020]  But there's an actual law that was passed that said no funding can be challenged in court that goes to these entities like Halliburton and whatever.
[01:48:12.321 --> 01:48:14.101]  They've covered their backside on that.
[01:48:14.481 --> 01:48:16.282]  So you can't credit even patents.
[01:48:16.322 --> 01:48:17.863]  You can't use seeds now.
[01:48:18.368 --> 01:48:18.669]  I think so.
[01:48:35.755 --> 01:48:36.936]  We're there for a long time.
[01:48:37.016 --> 01:48:43.922]  You know they have contracts to build lots and lots of housing for Americans, which means we're not going to get out anytime soon.
[01:48:43.942 --> 01:48:49.926]  They're going to build this, first it was 3,000, now 6,000-man embassy that's really an imperial command base.
[01:48:50.527 --> 01:48:51.107]  That's right.
[01:48:51.187 --> 01:48:52.668]  It's far more than an embassy.
[01:48:52.708 --> 01:48:54.890]  It's an intelligence network for the region.
[01:48:55.811 --> 01:49:00.014]  Also, you put a dialectical pressure on Israel with the Palestinians.
[01:49:00.413 --> 01:49:03.655]  So that you force them to accept the new world order.
[01:49:03.715 --> 01:49:06.437]  You know, we have to work these things out and all this sort of stuff.
[01:49:06.837 --> 01:49:10.179]  And so it's going to impact on them through this dialectical process.
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:14.282]  And that keeps a hard-line military government in power in Israel.
[01:49:14.602 --> 01:49:16.523]  Yeah, got to have that for self-defense.
[01:49:16.583 --> 01:49:17.164]  That's correct.
[01:49:18.124 --> 01:49:20.206]  But they're also being played.
[01:49:20.266 --> 01:49:21.387]  They're also being pressured.
[01:49:21.407 --> 01:49:24.248]  That's why you see them, you know, Sharon is doing certain things.
[01:49:24.609 --> 01:49:29.051]  At the same time, according to Haaretz, he says, I can tell the U.S.
[01:49:29.112 --> 01:49:29.592]  what to do.
[01:49:30.282 --> 01:49:36.368]  So, yeah, it's all part of a major master global plan that Brzezinski talked about, his grand chessboard.
[01:49:36.729 --> 01:49:37.229]  That's the thing.
[01:49:37.249 --> 01:49:41.594]  You can read stuff they wrote 10, 20 years ago, and then it's exactly what they're doing.
[01:49:41.614 --> 01:49:44.737]  I mean, it's not like we're going to some conspiracy theory.
[01:49:44.797 --> 01:49:47.019]  They say Saddam isn't a threat.
[01:49:47.099 --> 01:49:48.741]  It's about oil and a military base.
[01:49:49.141 --> 01:49:49.462]  That's right.
[01:49:49.682 --> 01:49:50.343]  That's Dick Cheney.
[01:49:50.543 --> 01:49:51.524]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:49:53.487 --> 01:50:00.334]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.655 --> 01:50:02.016]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.216 --> 01:50:04.439]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.579 --> 01:50:06.681]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.941 --> 01:50:11.866]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.227 --> 01:50:16.251]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.491 --> 01:50:18.252]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.332 --> 01:50:28.998]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.138 --> 01:50:31.039]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.239 --> 01:50:33.140]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:33.400]  888-2533-139.

[01:50:52.992 --> 01:50:53.352]  Thank you.
[01:51:13.942 --> 01:51:15.223]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:15.303 --> 01:51:21.187]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.387 --> 01:51:26.471]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.591 --> 01:51:35.477]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:35.737 --> 01:51:38.900]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:53.408 --> 01:53:06.110]  All right, we're going to go to the phone lines.
[01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:11.711]  And then I want to ask Dr. Cuddy about ways to stop the New World Order and their weak points.
[01:53:11.731 --> 01:53:14.812]  He'll have them with us for a half hour into the next hour.
[01:53:15.232 --> 01:53:18.793]  We've got a lot of callers here, so let's go to them.
[01:53:18.933 --> 01:53:21.253]  Alex and Ian and Jason and Deagle and others.
[01:53:22.382 --> 01:53:26.424]  Let's go ahead and go to Alex in North Carolina.
[01:53:26.545 --> 01:53:27.345]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:53:27.385 --> 01:53:27.805]  Go ahead.
[01:53:27.985 --> 01:53:28.406]  Hi, Alex.
[01:53:28.446 --> 01:53:29.206]  Hi, Dr. Cuddy.
[01:53:29.546 --> 01:53:43.594]  I've always been interested in science, especially when I was young, and I had my own little subscription to Scientific American in the 70s and 80s, and I remember seeing basically the basic research for the control grid systems that we have today.
[01:53:43.694 --> 01:53:48.477]  I remember seeing articles about how IBM was going to use RFID to control
[01:53:49.206 --> 01:53:52.127]  You know, track people in the workplace, and this is in, like, 1979.
[01:53:52.907 --> 01:54:07.630]  And then, in Scientific American, they would commonly have little sidebar articles from Hughes Aerospace about how great the new, I don't know, infrared goggles are or the new product that's going to protect a pilot's eyes from the atomic blast or something like that.
[01:54:07.870 --> 01:54:12.531]  Now, Scientific American, I think, has been really dumbed down lately, but back then, it was in the open.
[01:54:12.991 --> 01:54:14.771]  You could read about it and see the basic research.
[01:54:16.172 --> 01:54:28.583]  Yeah, the RFID they were talking about using, that's sort of locally within a particular area, although they're able to, the technology is getting to the point where
[01:54:29.412 --> 01:54:35.158]  The scanner and what they use is small enough so they can use it.
[01:54:35.238 --> 01:54:37.740]  They're going to use cell towers as the booster.
[01:54:38.081 --> 01:54:44.367]  Yeah, and then they link that with that GPS technology to locate you anywhere from long distances.
[01:54:44.427 --> 01:54:46.429]  And it's already in all the cell phones, folks.
[01:54:47.369 --> 01:54:50.911]  And in the 70s, if the caller will look back there, just go to the U.S.
[01:54:51.031 --> 01:54:52.432]  Patent and Trademark Office.
[01:54:53.072 --> 01:55:00.076]  I put in my book, The Globalist, you can find where they can alter, there's a patent to alter your brain waves remotely.
[01:55:00.457 --> 01:55:03.278]  The average citizen thinks you have to put the little electrodes in your head.
[01:55:03.318 --> 01:55:11.243]  There was a Baltimore Sun article where DARPA a few years ago was going, we're going to put up towers to calm everyone if there's an emergency.
[01:55:11.943 --> 01:55:15.465]  We're studying putting up mind control towers and it's normal.
[01:55:17.151 --> 01:55:22.974]  Yeah, and you set the stage for that by using what the Nazis did.
[01:55:22.994 --> 01:55:29.276]  This will take about 45 seconds, but let me run through this real quick.
[01:55:29.476 --> 01:55:38.080]  Edward Bernays was Sigmund Freud's nephew, comes over here, becomes CBS's chief advisor under William Paley in 1928, writes a book, Propaganda.
[01:55:38.675 --> 01:55:42.517]  Says, we have the means, the technical means, to control you now, manipulate you.
[01:55:42.537 --> 01:55:43.497]  We're an invisible government.
[01:55:43.977 --> 01:55:49.880]  Okay, so he's hired after the Second World War by Oscar Ewing, who's head of the Federal Security Agency.
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:53.862]  That includes public health agency.
[01:55:54.502 --> 01:55:57.684]  And what his job is to do is to get fluoride in the water.
[01:55:57.744 --> 01:55:58.604]  Now, why does he want to do that?
[01:55:59.304 --> 01:56:05.087]  They've discovered, they sent over a biochemist after the Second World War to find out what the Nazis had done.
[01:56:05.811 --> 01:56:19.300]  And they found what they had developed was the ability to put sodium fluoride in the water in the occupied areas because there's a left part of the brain that affects and makes you more docile, more accepting of authority.
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:20.181]  You don't question.
[01:56:20.201 --> 01:56:21.742]  You don't challenge authority.
[01:56:22.262 --> 01:56:23.423]  And so that was very useful.
[01:56:23.483 --> 01:56:27.326]  So that's what they had to do to condition the people, get that fluoride in the water.
[01:56:27.626 --> 01:56:29.588]  And so that's what Bernays' job was.
[01:56:30.208 --> 01:56:32.890]  And I have reports from England, the U.S., China.
[01:56:33.291 --> 01:56:39.876]  Sodium fluoride admittedly does this, but they have all the newscasts and movies where we're all kooks if we talk about it.
[01:56:42.337 --> 01:56:54.980]  Well, it's interesting on the current part 12 of my mental health series, which maybe we'll get to in a second, I will have pretty soon an actual from the 1950s, a can, a wrapper from the can.
[01:56:55.460 --> 01:56:56.980]  It says sodium fluoride.
[01:56:57.021 --> 01:56:59.121]  It says if you swallow this, it may kill you.
[01:56:59.621 --> 01:57:02.842]  So that gives you an indication of what they knew at the time.
[01:57:04.442 --> 01:57:05.303]  Well, it's incredible.
[01:57:05.363 --> 01:57:05.983]  Anything, Alex?
[01:57:07.625 --> 01:57:08.306]  Sorry, talking to mute.
[01:57:08.406 --> 01:57:14.213]  One other thing is, when I was going through my old magazines, I found a copy of Science Digest, which I believe is a Hearst publication.
[01:57:14.733 --> 01:57:27.648]  This is from 81, and in the back there's obviously an expensive full-color ad that says, The Most Incredible Book of All Time, and it's Necronomicon, and actually the little cut-out order form has the eye in the pyramid in it.
[01:57:27.728 --> 01:57:28.309]  Isn't that nice?
[01:57:29.528 --> 01:57:30.469]  It's good.
[01:57:30.809 --> 01:57:31.570]  Obviously it is.
[01:57:32.290 --> 01:57:34.992]  I should report to the Ministry of Love now, I suppose.
[01:57:35.012 --> 01:57:35.413]  Thank you.
[01:57:35.693 --> 01:57:37.975]  Yes, it's all going to be okay soon.
[01:57:38.155 --> 01:57:41.558]  Once the towers are up, we'll all feel much better.
[01:57:41.598 --> 01:57:42.158]  Big Brother.
[01:57:42.178 --> 01:57:43.719]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:52.754 --> 01:57:53.854]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.515 --> 01:57:55.335]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.095 --> 01:57:56.995]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.656 --> 01:58:01.317]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.837 --> 01:58:05.978]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.379 --> 01:58:12.140]  Hour number three of transmission against the global.
[01:58:13.561 --> 01:58:14.461]  Patrol Freaks.
[01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:20.892]  The scientific establishment of organized crime, sworn to dehumanize and enslave you.
[01:58:20.932 --> 01:58:24.533]  They hate freedom, they hate love, they hate decency and honor.
[01:58:25.874 --> 01:58:28.675]  They're literally out of the crack of Hades itself.
[01:58:29.595 --> 01:58:32.236]  They're the hell swarm, the spawn of the devil.
[01:58:32.696 --> 01:58:34.017]  I'm not joking when I say that.
[01:58:34.357 --> 01:58:39.999]  Dr. Cuddy, we're about to go back to Ian and Jason and Dr. Deagle, who's holding, we'll get to him.
[01:58:40.774 --> 01:58:50.736]  But, I mean, I don't think... Look, I set about exposing the New World Order just researching, and every time I find out it leads to the occult, it leads to pure evil...
[01:58:51.485 --> 01:58:51.625]  Yeah.
[01:58:51.645 --> 01:58:51.745]  Yeah.
[01:59:13.013 --> 01:59:20.756]  And just like the movies I talked about before, they're also showing a lot of movies that will have occultic activities and TV shows and so on.
[01:59:21.316 --> 01:59:22.977]  So the way it happens is like this.
[01:59:23.237 --> 01:59:30.540]  Alex, who just called in, he's monitored, let's say, Echelon or Iridium.
[01:59:30.760 --> 01:59:34.281]  One of their 12 stations is by the Bin Laden Group or the Great Wall of China.
[01:59:34.301 --> 01:59:36.982]  He finds out who and where Alex is.
[01:59:37.726 --> 01:59:43.129]  Then they know Alex is talking about these pyramids and checking in the ministry of love and so on.
[01:59:43.509 --> 01:59:47.851]  And so now they say, well, you know, Alex sounds like somebody who is paranoid.
[01:59:48.231 --> 01:59:49.551]  That's a mental health problem.
[01:59:49.872 --> 01:59:52.673]  We need to treat Alex for his mental health problem.
[01:59:52.753 --> 01:59:58.415]  And he'll feel much better once he's had the special medications and his implant.
[01:59:58.555 --> 01:59:59.096]  That is true.
[01:59:59.516 --> 02:00:04.098]  And so what you have is, and they usually have guinea pigs at first, so like in Texas,
[02:00:04.973 --> 02:00:05.994]  Where you're coming out of.
[02:00:06.574 --> 02:00:12.676]  The current thrust for mental health in the Bush White House comes from that algorithm project back there.
[02:00:12.957 --> 02:00:13.997]  TMAP, New Freedom.
[02:00:14.117 --> 02:00:14.777]  Yeah, TMAP.
[02:00:14.797 --> 02:00:16.438]  Well, there's also the TCMAP.
[02:00:16.478 --> 02:00:23.741]  That's the children's aspect of it, where what they do is... Listen, I got all the articles where they openly say, if you believe in a New World Order, you're mentally ill and need to be locked up.
[02:00:24.001 --> 02:00:28.663]  Yeah, and they give them... And the children, let's say, in foster care would be the guinea pigs.
[02:00:28.743 --> 02:00:30.144]  Over two-thirds are on drugs.
[02:00:30.244 --> 02:00:32.445]  Right, over two-thirds are on drugs, including...
[02:00:33.252 --> 02:00:46.022]  Something like Adderall, which is like the fourth leading ADHD drug in the nation, even though in February Canada banned it because of a lot of strokes and death from it.
[02:00:46.062 --> 02:00:47.483]  Well, that's not good.
[02:00:48.123 --> 02:00:49.064]  Well, we've still got it.
[02:00:49.524 --> 02:00:53.327]  Good!
[02:00:53.367 --> 02:00:54.148]  Well, that's good.
[02:00:54.188 --> 02:00:55.489]  Population control, right?
[02:00:55.529 --> 02:00:58.091]  Reduce the population, especially those little troublemakers.
[02:00:58.471 --> 02:01:03.355]  Get all the patriotic young people to go into the military so we can send them over to Iraq.
[02:01:03.415 --> 02:01:04.436]  They get killed, right?
[02:01:04.736 --> 02:01:08.379]  Then we need the Germans over here because our National Guard is over there.
[02:01:08.720 --> 02:01:11.382]  So you have the Germans and Chinese over here to protect us.
[02:01:11.402 --> 02:01:12.022]  That's not a joke.
[02:01:12.082 --> 02:01:16.826]  I've got article after article where they're doing drills all over the country admitting it's for domestic control.
[02:01:17.767 --> 02:01:19.589]  Yeah, and see, they'll say, well, we have to.
[02:01:19.649 --> 02:01:21.811]  Our National Guard's over in Iraq or wherever.
[02:01:22.331 --> 02:01:23.412]  They actually say that.
[02:01:24.747 --> 02:01:31.189]  Yeah, and they'll be much more willing to shoot us if we don't turn over our guns than American troops would be willing to do.
[02:01:31.209 --> 02:01:32.010]  Well, that's conservative.
[02:01:32.050 --> 02:01:34.510]  Not turning in your guns is liberal.
[02:01:34.630 --> 02:01:35.671]  Yeah, right.
[02:01:35.711 --> 02:01:36.391]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:01:36.891 --> 02:01:48.075]  And so what you have, and the public just accepts this, because they've been conditioned to, whether it's with a floor ride and you'll be more docile or whatever, or there'll be some incident, right?
[02:01:48.115 --> 02:01:50.596]  Some mass murder will go around blowing up kids again.
[02:01:51.050 --> 02:01:54.313]  And he'll say, oh yeah, okay, gun control, I'll go along with it.
[02:01:54.573 --> 02:01:58.596]  I'm afraid we're going to have to get rid of all of the Republic now.
[02:02:01.333 --> 02:02:06.538]  Well, the way you do that is you don't say, we're getting rid of the republic now.
[02:02:06.738 --> 02:02:07.959]  We're strengthening it.
[02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:10.341]  We're reorganizing it.
[02:02:10.381 --> 02:02:10.822]  There you go.
[02:02:10.842 --> 02:02:15.666]  You reorganize it to include, let's say, Canada and Mexico, and then you broaden that a little bit.
[02:02:15.686 --> 02:02:18.609]  You have economic links at first.
[02:02:18.969 --> 02:02:24.714]  We are reorganizing the republic into the first global empire!
[02:02:28.306 --> 02:02:29.466]  Having some fun, Dr. Cutter.
[02:02:29.506 --> 02:02:29.767]  I know.
[02:02:30.847 --> 02:02:31.147]  Good.
[02:02:31.167 --> 02:02:33.628]  All right, we'll be right back with your calls.
[02:02:33.648 --> 02:02:36.929]  He's absolutely on target, a real mind, and we love him.
[02:02:37.669 --> 02:02:38.409]  He's joining us.
[02:02:38.910 --> 02:02:40.990]  We're going to your calls after this quick break.
[02:02:41.010 --> 02:02:43.851]  You'll soon have your chips, and it won't hurt anymore.
[02:02:45.912 --> 02:02:48.733]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:49.526 --> 02:02:50.807]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.007 --> 02:02:56.749]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.029 --> 02:03:02.270]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:02.571 --> 02:03:06.692]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:03:06.872 --> 02:03:10.676]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:03:10.937 --> 02:03:15.542]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:03:15.662 --> 02:03:21.929]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.969 --> 02:03:23.791]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:03:24.271 --> 02:03:26.352]  Order 911 The Road to Terry today.
[02:03:26.432 --> 02:03:30.055]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:03:40.321 --> 02:03:41.842]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:42.002 --> 02:03:44.063]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:44.984 --> 02:03:53.610]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[02:03:53.830 --> 02:04:05.098]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[02:04:05.318 --> 02:04:07.940]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:08.300 --> 02:04:14.766]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:04:14.926 --> 02:04:16.808]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:04:16.988 --> 02:04:23.014]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:04:23.274 --> 02:04:28.939]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[02:04:29.259 --> 02:04:33.181]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:04:33.941 --> 02:04:34.622]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:44.932 --> 02:04:52.378]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.
[02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:56.701]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.
[02:04:56.941 --> 02:05:08.610]  By calling 1-888-PETS-911 or visiting 1-888-PETS-911.org, you will find the location of your closest adoption facility as well as tons of other information you need to know as a responsible pet owner.
[02:05:08.790 --> 02:05:10.391]  So when thinking adoption, think Pets 911.
[02:05:14.329 --> 02:05:16.030]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:05:16.230 --> 02:05:18.251]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:05:18.431 --> 02:05:19.111]  Prepare yourself.
[02:05:19.291 --> 02:05:22.993]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[02:05:35.039 --> 02:05:37.900]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[02:05:37.940 --> 02:05:38.681]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[02:05:49.796 --> 02:05:50.417]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.437 --> 02:05:52.178]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.878 --> 02:05:53.959]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:55.460]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.201 --> 02:05:57.081]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.101 --> 02:06:01.585]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.945 --> 02:06:06.088]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.268 --> 02:06:08.990]  All right, we've just got two seconds.
[02:06:09.810 --> 02:06:10.891]  Two segments.
[02:06:10.951 --> 02:06:12.032]  Feels like two seconds.
[02:06:12.973 --> 02:06:14.774]  Left with Dr. Dennis Cuddy.
[02:06:15.714 --> 02:06:19.735]  Then I'm going to cover a bunch of other key news items, but we'll cover some of that news right now with him.
[02:06:19.795 --> 02:06:20.755]  I know we've got loaded phones.
[02:06:20.796 --> 02:06:22.076]  We'll go to your calls here in just a moment.
[02:06:22.536 --> 02:06:28.058]  But Dr. Cuddy, to get this out of the way now because it's important, in a nutshell, what is the true goal of the New World Order?
[02:06:28.438 --> 02:06:30.578]  What is their driving ideology and philosophy?
[02:06:30.939 --> 02:06:32.499]  And what are ways to stop them?
[02:06:34.393 --> 02:06:49.759]  Ultimately, there is a spiritual aspect to this, but it's being presented economically at first in terms of a global economy which has to be managed by a world government, which their goal is a synthesis of Western capitalism and Eastern communism into a world socialist government.
[02:06:49.779 --> 02:06:56.322]  That will be the mechanism, but it will also include this new world religion as well, which will be occultic and so forth.
[02:06:56.795 --> 02:06:58.036]  So that's the ultimate goal.
[02:06:58.076 --> 02:06:58.817]  How to stop them?
[02:06:59.837 --> 02:07:04.161]  I'm supposed to give a pitch about stiff upper lip and do all this sort of stuff.
[02:07:04.581 --> 02:07:06.082]  Well, it's going to be hard.
[02:07:06.662 --> 02:07:08.584]  As a Christian, I say pray first.
[02:07:08.624 --> 02:07:09.965]  Nothing will be accomplished without that.
[02:07:10.385 --> 02:07:17.590]  But until the American public gets out of its lethargy, which it has been conditioned into, it's going to be really hard.
[02:07:17.631 --> 02:07:18.791]  It really will be.
[02:07:19.212 --> 02:07:23.575]  And I'm afraid it will take some sort of cataclysmic advice, I mean event,
[02:07:24.091 --> 02:07:33.180]  And I've put one of those possibilities on newswithviews.com in an article where it's titled, Babylon Has Fallen This Fall in That Great City.
[02:07:34.521 --> 02:07:37.304]  I'm afraid it will take that to turn the people around.
[02:07:37.344 --> 02:07:46.913]  It will have to be at the grassroots, and I'm afraid it's going to be really hard because the public is sitting there fat, dumb, and happy watching their TV and eating pizza.
[02:07:48.220 --> 02:07:51.683]  I wish I could be encouraging, and we should be.
[02:07:52.144 --> 02:08:02.053]  Biblically speaking, we're supposed to occupy and fight the good cause and be watchmen of the wall and warn the people, and we're supposed to be about that every single day.
[02:08:02.073 --> 02:08:04.455]  I'm just saying, realistically, it's going to be very hard.
[02:08:04.495 --> 02:08:05.576]  It won't be a quick fix.
[02:08:05.996 --> 02:08:07.036]  Well, I mean, I know this.
[02:08:07.076 --> 02:08:09.237]  We have victories all the time at the local level.
[02:08:09.257 --> 02:08:11.258]  Federally, though, they are just... They are just...
[02:08:35.134 --> 02:08:38.638]  Yeah, an example would be this.
[02:08:38.658 --> 02:08:41.943]  75-80% of the people said we don't want NAFTA and GATT.
[02:08:42.123 --> 02:08:43.185]  They vote for it anyway.
[02:08:43.205 --> 02:08:44.727]  80% don't want open borders?
[02:08:44.767 --> 02:08:45.508]  They do it anyway.
[02:08:45.548 --> 02:08:46.769]  Now, why can they do that?
[02:08:46.870 --> 02:08:48.412]  It's because the average person
[02:08:48.911 --> 02:08:52.853]  We'll go out to the polls the next time and re-elect those same people.
[02:08:53.494 --> 02:08:54.474]  The same people.
[02:08:54.975 --> 02:09:04.320]  Just like when Strobe Talbot, who was Bill Clinton's Rhodes Scholar roommate, wrote in Time Magazine about perhaps national sovereignty wasn't such a great idea after all the case where world governments clenched.
[02:09:04.621 --> 02:09:06.101]  And about 96 of our U.S.
[02:09:06.141 --> 02:09:08.303]  Senators said, yes, we confirm him.
[02:09:08.363 --> 02:09:11.465]  We approve him to be a top-level person at the State Department.
[02:09:11.485 --> 02:09:13.626]  And then you talk about global government, it doesn't exist.
[02:09:13.646 --> 02:09:15.207]  You're crazy when it's in Time Magazine.
[02:09:15.908 --> 02:09:16.548]  Yeah, right.
[02:09:16.648 --> 02:09:20.309]  And our senators, including, quote, conservative senators, approve the guy.
[02:09:21.210 --> 02:09:23.430]  I want to shift gears for a moment, then we're going right to the calls.
[02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:24.110]  But I've got to say this.
[02:09:24.130 --> 02:09:29.592]  We've gotten a few calls, and even the folks who are on the show said, I wasn't aware they were going to put up mind control towers.
[02:09:30.132 --> 02:09:37.374]  Folks, you'll see poor schizophrenics and people put stuff on their house and freak out, and they're sure they're being attacked.
[02:09:38.054 --> 02:09:40.295]  And so don't confuse that with reality.
[02:09:41.967 --> 02:09:45.791]  This atmosphere makes crazies get even crazier, but let's be specific.
[02:09:46.512 --> 02:09:58.625]  DARPA has this patented, and they told the Boston Globe about two years ago, it's on the site, they said in case of emergency, we're going to put up towers that will calm you, and it's going to be good.
[02:09:58.645 --> 02:10:01.188]  And folks, they really are doing that.
[02:10:01.228 --> 02:10:03.010]  They really do have that.
[02:10:03.750 --> 02:10:05.352]  And it's not a joke.
[02:10:05.553 --> 02:10:07.094]  It's real.
[02:10:07.755 --> 02:10:18.127]  The Sunshine Project three years ago got the documents where in every major city there's helicopters waiting with knockout gas bottles hooked onto them, which they admit will cause massive fires, car wrecks, death.
[02:10:18.527 --> 02:10:21.391]  I mean, knock it out a whole... I mean, folks, they are geared up for it.
[02:10:22.192 --> 02:10:23.013]  Dr. Cuddy comments.
[02:10:24.467 --> 02:10:28.468]  Yeah, a lot of stuff we just haven't learned of.
[02:10:28.608 --> 02:10:33.849]  Part of MKUltra back in the 50s involved some of that stuff.
[02:10:34.309 --> 02:10:41.831]  There are papers, you can find them on the internet, and actual project numbers where it says this is our task to develop these types of abilities.
[02:10:42.411 --> 02:10:44.071]  And so they've been working that.
[02:10:44.131 --> 02:10:51.213]  Why would DARPA tell a major newspaper, and it's in several Army reports from five years ago, that they're going to put up mine control towers?
[02:10:52.097 --> 02:11:00.623]  Well, you're supposed to, therefore, become used to it, and sometimes it's a test.
[02:11:01.103 --> 02:11:11.871]  In other words, they'll have a Terry Chabot situation, whatever it is, because what they want to see is how far they can go, how fast, and what the public will resist.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:24.406]  So they might float a mind control and say, well, let's just stick this out there and see what percentage of the people gets concerned enough to actually do something, not just huff and puff, but actually do something about it.
[02:11:24.706 --> 02:11:28.448]  And if the public doesn't, if they just say ho-hum, well, you know, they're home free.
[02:11:30.269 --> 02:11:30.849]  Unbelievable.
[02:11:30.869 --> 02:11:32.970]  Let's go to Ian in Canada.
[02:11:33.050 --> 02:11:33.750]  Ian, go ahead.
[02:11:34.471 --> 02:11:35.671]  Hi, Alex.
[02:11:35.971 --> 02:11:41.374]  I called because there seem to be so many reports of activities around the country, special operations activities,
[02:11:41.818 --> 02:11:44.839]  Well, they're always doing these conditioning drills, but yeah, they're getting real bad.
[02:11:45.259 --> 02:11:53.602]  Well, we had a very intense black helicopter activity up here from the mid-90s through until February of 2001.
[02:11:54.302 --> 02:12:03.145]  It may have had something to do with the fact that this is a rich area for pumping bottled water out at more than the price of oil.
[02:12:03.606 --> 02:12:07.647]  If any of your listeners are drinking bottled water, there's a good chance it was pumped out within five
[02:12:09.544 --> 02:12:13.267]  Let me just cut through all the why they're flying around.
[02:12:13.628 --> 02:12:16.950]  We have the Rand Corporation documents, Finnegan documents.
[02:12:17.031 --> 02:12:26.498]  It is admittedly a conditioning mechanism to condition the public to accept military operations and the takeover of major cities and small towns.
[02:12:26.979 --> 02:12:30.202]  That's covered in my film, so then you... Bottled water.
[02:12:30.262 --> 02:12:31.363]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:12:31.383 --> 02:12:34.145]  Well, I said to myself after February of 2001, after 9-11, that
[02:12:35.836 --> 02:12:42.920]  We probably wouldn't see them around because those assets would be deployed, but when they turned up again, that would be a watershed event.
[02:12:43.000 --> 02:12:47.303]  Yeah, it's about to happen again, but what's the connection with bottled water?
[02:12:47.683 --> 02:12:52.926]  There were ground aerial surveys were done here for the water bottlers who have a connection with the larger
[02:12:53.619 --> 02:12:56.660]  Oh, you think they were looking for underground water supplies.
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.661]  I got you.
[02:12:58.881 --> 02:13:04.662]  They had no navigation lights, flat black, but occasionally they would have a red sensor on a boom below the belly of the aircraft.
[02:13:04.682 --> 02:13:05.883]  Well, they always have a red light.
[02:13:06.223 --> 02:13:13.025]  And people would, of course, dismiss them as looking for drugs, but not in November and not in January and February when there's two feet of snow on the ground.
[02:13:14.105 --> 02:13:15.726]  So that's what I figured.
[02:13:15.766 --> 02:13:23.128]  Now, what I wanted to tell you about this weekend was that, sure enough, it's a holiday weekend up here, the weekend before your Memorial Day weekend.
[02:13:23.752 --> 02:13:34.442]  And a squadron of eight shiny new black helicopters are flying around here in close but loose formation, four up ahead, separated from four behind.
[02:13:34.562 --> 02:13:34.802]  All right.
[02:13:35.803 --> 02:13:37.545]  Thanks for the call, Lee, and let me just comment on this.
[02:13:38.689 --> 02:13:48.601]  Folks, I had the Suncoast Times a week and a half ago, and it said they're going to have tens of thousands of troops, foreign troops, National Guard, running around doing urban warfare, blowing buildings up.
[02:13:49.282 --> 02:13:54.709]  We just got calls about it all over the country, and they say it's working with local police.
[02:13:55.369 --> 02:14:03.735]  So I've got all these mainstream news articles on my site where they say it's what it's about, and I always get calls, and I'm not mad at the callers, Dr. Cuddy.
[02:14:04.135 --> 02:14:07.297]  They always say, I think they're doing this, I think they're doing that.
[02:14:09.779 --> 02:14:10.679]  What are they doing?
[02:14:10.719 --> 02:14:15.483]  And then I never really hear anyone talk about all the mainstream news articles admitting what they're doing.
[02:14:15.523 --> 02:14:16.003]  Dr. Cuddy?
[02:14:17.422 --> 02:14:20.804]  Yeah, that's what you have to guard against.
[02:14:21.224 --> 02:14:34.354]  And sometimes there are, like you said, trial balloons, and you have to be cautious about that because not only there's a controlled opposition, there's a disinformation aspect to this.
[02:14:35.014 --> 02:14:45.582]  And so what you look for is, well, tune into Alex Jones' program, because a lot of times you won't find in the mainstream media what's actually going on.
[02:14:46.261 --> 02:14:47.161]  Well, here's an example.
[02:14:47.281 --> 02:14:53.903]  I know what they're doing at Berkshire International Airport, formerly the Air Force Base, because I know people that work there, even family.
[02:14:54.484 --> 02:15:03.046]  And they openly are merging the regular army with the National Guard and the local police department, and they got helicopters out every night looking through our walls, surveilling us, looking for drugs.
[02:15:03.746 --> 02:15:12.329]  So, right there, they're creating that relationship with the cover of drugs, but behind that, then, is the anti-terror, i.e., suppression of the population mechanism.
[02:15:13.623 --> 02:15:16.364]  Yeah, and that's similar to what they did at Waco.
[02:15:16.484 --> 02:15:22.825]  You had the Wesley Clark, Rhodes Scholar, Fort Hood mock-up of the Branch Davidian compound.
[02:15:22.845 --> 02:15:24.445]  You get the local police involved.
[02:15:24.465 --> 02:15:28.526]  You get General Shoemaker, who's now Chief of Staff of the Army.
[02:15:28.546 --> 02:15:33.127]  It was like a reunion or something.
[02:15:33.147 --> 02:15:36.748]  They had special forces from Russia, Israel, SAS, Britain.
[02:15:38.400 --> 02:15:45.622]  Yeah, and they conduct these at various places, Fort Hood, Fort Polk, Louisiana, which fits with that 1952 map.
[02:15:45.662 --> 02:15:48.043]  Remember that map where it said other nations?
[02:15:48.263 --> 02:15:52.024]  Yeah, the force restructuring, where our force goes down, the multinational gets bigger.
[02:15:52.625 --> 02:15:55.025]  Yeah, and they actually plotted out where they would be.
[02:15:55.045 --> 02:15:55.386]  That's 7277.
[02:15:57.306 --> 02:16:00.590]  It's before that one.
[02:16:00.630 --> 02:16:13.403]  Yeah, 7277 is the document which also said if the communist threat were greatly abated, the West would lose whatever incentive it had for world government, which fits with the scenario we were talking about, how you have to have this dialogue.
[02:16:13.423 --> 02:16:14.664]  And again, they openly say this.
[02:16:14.724 --> 02:16:19.689]  They create the false threat to build up the empire here and bring in the, quote, communist system they were fighting.
[02:16:20.229 --> 02:16:22.271]  And they go, well, we're a capitalist system.
[02:16:22.311 --> 02:16:26.934]  The capitalists use a socialist system to consolidate and to thieve our wealth.
[02:16:27.655 --> 02:16:27.855]  Right.
[02:16:27.895 --> 02:16:29.556]  The monopoly capitalists at the top.
[02:16:29.576 --> 02:16:29.957]  That's right.
[02:16:30.217 --> 02:16:32.598]  Let's talk to Jason in Canada.
[02:16:32.639 --> 02:16:33.739]  Canada after Canada.
[02:16:33.759 --> 02:16:34.520]  Then Dr. Deagle.
[02:16:34.540 --> 02:16:35.220]  Go ahead, Jason.
[02:16:35.561 --> 02:16:36.341]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:16:36.521 --> 02:16:36.802]  Good.
[02:16:37.762 --> 02:16:40.564]  Your martial law movie really, really is excellent.
[02:16:41.045 --> 02:16:43.947]  And I've been passing out copies to as many people as I could.
[02:16:44.868 --> 02:16:49.251]  But I'm here in Edmonton, Alberta, where the queen is actually.
[02:16:50.268 --> 02:16:56.392]  And you were talking about the Manitoba Legislature building last week?
[02:16:57.672 --> 02:17:08.458]  How your major papers admitted that it was all according to satanic diagrams, and the AP yesterday admitted, finally, that the Washington Monument and all of that is a cult, right out in the open, yes.
[02:17:08.638 --> 02:17:09.019]  You bet.
[02:17:09.139 --> 02:17:13.061]  To add to that, like, we have a sin number here, as far as I can remember.
[02:17:13.141 --> 02:17:18.404]  Everybody born has a number, and it's three sets of three digits.
[02:17:18.962 --> 02:17:20.062]  And it's called the Sin Number.
[02:17:21.243 --> 02:17:34.507]  And also, last night coming from our legislature building, which looks just like the one in Manitoba, there was hooting noises coming out at around 9 o'clock for about 20 seconds.
[02:17:36.207 --> 02:17:37.188]  Well, just stay there.
[02:17:37.208 --> 02:17:38.668]  We'll let Dr. Cuddy comment on this.
[02:17:38.688 --> 02:17:40.228]  The AP going, oh yes, the D.C.
[02:17:40.349 --> 02:17:41.909]  is laid out as a giant temple.
[02:17:42.389 --> 02:17:43.770]  It's no big deal, though.
[02:17:51.418 --> 02:17:56.598]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, Give me liberty or give me death.
[02:17:57.559 --> 02:18:10.781]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:18:11.581 --> 02:18:16.862]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[02:18:17.757 --> 02:18:25.063]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms, we'll send you absolutely free a one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:25.823 --> 02:18:26.344]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[02:18:26.364 --> 02:18:26.684]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:18:26.704 --> 02:18:28.485]  It's absolutely free.
[02:18:28.686 --> 02:18:32.469]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[02:18:32.509 --> 02:18:33.089]  Just call right now.
[02:18:45.166 --> 02:18:53.029]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, and threats, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:18:53.269 --> 02:18:54.870]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:18:55.110 --> 02:18:57.591]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:18:57.971 --> 02:19:12.536]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:19:12.576 --> 02:19:12.896]  government.
[02:19:13.056 --> 02:19:14.877]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:19:15.237 --> 02:19:21.162]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:19:21.302 --> 02:19:25.806]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:19:26.046 --> 02:19:32.772]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:19:46.175 --> 02:19:48.476]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[02:19:48.496 --> 02:19:49.837]  The real money folks.
[02:19:53.138 --> 02:19:55.059]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[02:19:55.559 --> 02:19:56.539]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:19:56.619 --> 02:19:57.820]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[02:19:57.960 --> 02:19:58.480]  A 5% increase.
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:02.101]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[02:20:02.121 --> 02:20:05.143]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:20:14.392 --> 02:20:20.014]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[02:20:20.634 --> 02:20:23.675]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:20:24.215 --> 02:20:29.377]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:30.658 --> 02:20:34.579]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.

[02:20:38.661 --> 02:20:40.061]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.508 --> 02:20:49.933]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[02:20:50.053 --> 02:20:58.381]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[02:20:58.601 --> 02:21:00.203]  More than likely, this includes you.
[02:21:00.383 --> 02:21:03.506]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need for Mother Earth Minerals.
[02:21:03.746 --> 02:21:16.849]  Mother Earth Minerals specializes in providing the primary building blocks for nutritional supplementation, including liquid, water-soluble, elemental mineral suspensions, contain the essential nutrients required for the proper function of muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and organs.

[02:21:50.121 --> 02:21:52.022]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:52.502 --> 02:21:55.223]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:57.414 --> 02:22:04.236]  All right, Jason in Canada.
[02:22:04.716 --> 02:22:06.377]  Canada call after Canada call.
[02:22:07.337 --> 02:22:08.358]  Finish up what you were saying.
[02:22:08.398 --> 02:22:19.041]  I think what you heard is they have the screech of eagles, hawks, and owls to scare pigeons that deface different structures.
[02:22:19.061 --> 02:22:23.062]  I mean, you'll hear that walking around a grocery store here in Austin, Texas.
[02:22:23.082 --> 02:22:24.383]  You'll hear a, whoo!
[02:22:27.397 --> 02:22:29.918]  You know, the different cries of birds.
[02:22:30.739 --> 02:22:38.703]  And so, yes, those are occult-designed structures, but you probably heard the anti-fowl screech of a predatory birdie.
[02:22:39.303 --> 02:22:52.049]  But going back to Dr. Dennis Cuddy, sir, getting into, did you see the AP article yesterday about, yes, the Capitol's all set up occult and the Washington Monument, but it's good.
[02:22:52.370 --> 02:22:53.190]  Did you hear about that?
[02:22:54.258 --> 02:22:55.719]  Not that particular one.
[02:22:55.759 --> 02:22:58.983]  That's been known for quite some time.
[02:22:59.343 --> 02:23:01.486]  The pentagram and the compass and the square.
[02:23:01.506 --> 02:23:06.211]  The Freemasons of the day basically set that up.
[02:23:06.291 --> 02:23:14.361]  In fact, if you go to the Scottish Rite Temple there, the head office of the Freemasons in D.C., you'll see embedded swastikas in the thing.
[02:23:15.041 --> 02:23:16.702]  Most people don't know that.
[02:23:17.083 --> 02:23:29.491]  The reason is the swastikas have been associated with the Aryans, Aryan race, which is supposedly the last of the civilizations that survived Atlantis and Plato.
[02:23:29.551 --> 02:23:30.952]  And that's what Iran means.
[02:23:31.112 --> 02:23:34.374]  Iran is translated into Aryan.
[02:23:34.534 --> 02:23:40.919]  And so what happened was Francis Bacon picked up on this and wrote a book called The New Atlantis.
[02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:41.339]  And he had...
[02:23:41.983 --> 02:23:44.566]  A lot of his secret stuff brought over.
[02:23:45.247 --> 02:23:49.191]  That book, as it was originally published posthumously, didn't have all the secrets.
[02:23:49.471 --> 02:23:52.675]  The rest of the secrets were brought over by Nathaniel Bacon, his relative.
[02:23:53.516 --> 02:23:56.679]  They would foment the Whiskey Rebellion and all that stuff in the early part.
[02:23:56.719 --> 02:24:00.403]  They had this underground vault near Williamsburg, Old Bruton Parish.
[02:24:00.483 --> 02:24:02.986]  Jefferson was the last one to look at that stuff, and he dug it up.
[02:24:03.456 --> 02:24:03.936]  Absolutely.
[02:24:04.036 --> 02:24:05.137]  They're completely out of control.
[02:24:05.157 --> 02:24:06.097]  Thank you for the call, Jason.
[02:24:06.117 --> 02:24:06.917]  Let's talk to Dr. Deagle.
[02:24:06.937 --> 02:24:08.778]  Dr. Deagle, I haven't heard from you in a while.
[02:24:08.878 --> 02:24:09.358]  Welcome, sir.
[02:24:09.398 --> 02:24:09.878]  Welcome, Alex.
[02:24:09.898 --> 02:24:12.019]  You have an amazing guest on with Dr. Cuddy and Dr. Deagle.
[02:24:33.080 --> 02:24:36.001]  I want to back up that everything he's saying is absolutely true.
[02:24:37.402 --> 02:24:39.483]  It's even more horrible than that.
[02:24:39.763 --> 02:24:50.427]  People better wake up immediately and get your videos and try to replicate and become Alex Jones in their countries because the plans aren't just for America where liberty is shining.
[02:24:50.447 --> 02:24:52.148]  It's happening in Canada.
[02:24:52.168 --> 02:24:53.388]  It's happening in Britain and elsewhere.
[02:24:53.408 --> 02:24:58.751]  If you're listening on this overseas, wake up and take up the standard because there's no silent heroes.
[02:25:00.239 --> 02:25:07.641]  There's going to be a conference coming up here with Pastor Butch Paw on June 4th, just a week and a half from now, talking about unveiling the beast.
[02:25:07.681 --> 02:25:13.463]  We have, of course, Colonel Craig Roberts and Dave Von Kleist and Joyce Riley and myself.
[02:25:13.503 --> 02:25:19.784]  I'll be talking about the mark as a medical procedure and giving a lot of, you know, very scary but unfortunately very true information.
[02:25:20.444 --> 02:25:20.985]  Well, interesting.
[02:25:21.005 --> 02:25:23.985]  Do you have any questions or comments for Dr. Cuddy?
[02:25:24.426 --> 02:25:29.607]  Yeah, the fact is that people need to face the fact of what Dr. Cuddy is saying.
[02:25:30.239 --> 02:25:34.841]  That this isn't just an ID card, you know, like a credit card in your hand.
[02:25:34.921 --> 02:25:39.543]  It's the national database, but it's also a mind control uplink chip that they're planning to put on.
[02:25:39.583 --> 02:25:43.725]  So people wonder why would a credit card put you in a position at odds with God?
[02:25:43.805 --> 02:25:48.787]  The reason for it is because their ultimate plan is to mind control the entire population and turn them into cyborgs.
[02:25:49.047 --> 02:25:54.890]  Well, that's what the Pentagon says in the Hive Mind Report and in another report, but why don't we just ignore that?
[02:25:55.583 --> 02:25:59.066]  Yeah, the valid fact is there's lots of documentation that you can stick to.
[02:25:59.086 --> 02:26:03.709]  You don't have to get into things that are off into a kind of conjecture.
[02:26:03.769 --> 02:26:07.331]  There's so much stuff that's published straight from the convergent technologies.
[02:26:07.351 --> 02:26:08.292]  Well, that was my question.
[02:26:08.312 --> 02:26:15.717]  My final question for Dr. Cuddy is, why would the Associated Press come right out and just admit all this now?
[02:26:15.897 --> 02:26:16.338]  They do.
[02:26:16.698 --> 02:26:19.320]  A lot of that is, like I said, a sort of test.
[02:26:19.847 --> 02:26:26.011]  To some extent it's an in-your-face, you know, what are you going to do about it, that sort of scenario.
[02:26:26.812 --> 02:26:28.753]  But why are they doing that now?
[02:26:29.834 --> 02:26:39.480]  Well, like I said, they figure there's a critical element in time to see what the population is willing to do because they have something else planned.
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:42.282]  And so let's say the public accepts that.
[02:26:42.582 --> 02:26:45.124]  Then what you need to think about is what's their next step.
[02:26:45.692 --> 02:26:47.413]  What can they use that for?
[02:26:48.614 --> 02:26:49.555]  Public temples.
[02:26:49.835 --> 02:26:50.415]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:26:51.316 --> 02:27:07.206]  I really see this coming, but I see a number of things brewing, not only the weather modification, but I've got some very significant evidence from my background in infectious disease and talking to other virologists that they have plagues planned that they're going to release here in the next year or two.
[02:27:08.449 --> 02:27:09.310]  Well, I hope you're wrong.
[02:27:09.330 --> 02:27:11.651]  I'll let you finish up about that, Dr. Deagle, on the other side.
[02:27:12.211 --> 02:27:15.052]  Author of the cover-up, which we're carrying, 9-11 in Iraq.
[02:27:15.112 --> 02:27:15.832]  It's excellent.
[02:27:15.912 --> 02:27:18.354]  We have it at InfoWars.com or by writing to us.
[02:27:19.454 --> 02:27:21.935]  Dr. Dennis Cuddy, always an honor to have you, my friend.
[02:27:22.235 --> 02:27:22.755]  Thanks for having me.
[02:27:23.136 --> 02:27:24.896]  I really appreciate you coming on with us.
[02:27:25.317 --> 02:27:25.657]  Thank you.
[02:27:26.597 --> 02:27:30.099]  You can go to NewsReviews.com, read some of his great columns, or at PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:27:30.119 --> 02:27:30.719]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.729 --> 02:27:36.649]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.110 --> 02:27:38.750]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.770 --> 02:27:42.412]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.333 --> 02:27:53.316]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[02:27:53.697 --> 02:27:54.937]  It suppresses your immune system.
[02:27:55.177 --> 02:27:55.837]  Now check this out.
[02:27:56.198 --> 02:27:59.579]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[02:27:59.939 --> 02:28:02.120]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:04.201]  Do you know what happens when your immune
[02:28:04.281 --> 02:28:04.782]  We're good to go.
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:24.403]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[02:28:24.723 --> 02:28:26.744]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Agaricus Bio at 20% off.
[02:28:26.764 --> 02:28:28.145]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[02:28:28.165 --> 02:28:29.886]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to do.
[02:28:30.267 --> 02:28:31.267]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[02:28:45.862 --> 02:28:49.083]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:28:49.123 --> 02:28:49.663]  are located?
[02:28:49.863 --> 02:28:53.244]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:28:53.464 --> 02:28:58.166]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[02:28:58.446 --> 02:29:09.749]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas, brewing environmental catastrophes, the safest cities, the best places for solar and wind energy, and much, much more.
[02:29:10.029 --> 02:29:12.070]  Complete with three gigabytes of detailed information,
[02:29:12.110 --> 02:29:13.011]  We're good to go.
[02:29:37.446 --> 02:29:39.148]  That's 888-803-4438 to order on the web
[02:29:45.554 --> 02:29:52.460]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:29:52.980 --> 02:29:58.405]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[02:29:58.805 --> 02:30:08.834]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, epinoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:30:08.954 --> 02:30:11.256]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:30:11.676 --> 02:30:14.697]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:30:14.797 --> 02:30:16.378]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:30:16.498 --> 02:30:23.982]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:30:24.242 --> 02:30:25.962]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[02:30:26.303 --> 02:30:37.988]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Long's, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:30:38.568 --> 02:30:42.931]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:30:48.154 --> 02:30:54.178]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.778 --> 02:30:57.760]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:59.601 --> 02:31:01.262]  All right, I'll take five more calls.
[02:31:01.302 --> 02:31:04.344]  We'll finish up with Deagle, then I'll go to Jeff, John, Rick, and Christina.
[02:31:04.404 --> 02:31:07.186]  That's all I have time for because I want to hit some other news here.
[02:31:08.877 --> 02:31:19.060]  But I hope this broadcast has been enlightening for you about the history and operations and architecture, both literal and figurative, of the globalist control system.
[02:31:19.860 --> 02:31:35.225]  Before I go back to your calls, I'm going to be showing my film, my best film, my little mini-series, two and a half plus hours at the Alamo Draft House Cinema in downtown Austin on Colorado Street twice on June 3rd, Friday, June 3rd,
[02:31:36.272 --> 02:31:41.835]  Coming up in about 10 days or less, Friday, June 3rd, 7 and 10 p.m.
[02:31:41.875 --> 02:31:45.737]  I'll also have a question and answer at the end of each showing.
[02:31:45.777 --> 02:31:48.318]  I'll be there with my videos and books and other materials.
[02:31:48.979 --> 02:32:00.845]  That's coming up, and about half the tickets have now sold for the three showings, because there's the other showing the next week, about five or six days later.
[02:32:02.561 --> 02:32:06.405]  On Wednesday, June 8th at 8 p.m.
[02:32:06.425 --> 02:32:08.707]  at the Alamo Drafthouse on South Lamar.
[02:32:09.347 --> 02:32:10.288]  We don't want to go downtown.
[02:32:12.050 --> 02:32:13.671]  About half the tickets have sold.
[02:32:14.672 --> 02:32:17.895]  If you average together the three showings, about half the tickets have sold.
[02:32:18.736 --> 02:32:26.703]  It would be advisable to go ahead and go to Infowars.com if you are online, and to go there to the site.
[02:32:27.951 --> 02:32:34.898]  And to click through to the Alamo Draft House website and pick one of the three showings that you wish to go to.
[02:32:35.498 --> 02:32:41.464]  I would imagine that one of the showings is probably going to sell out even before you can buy tickets that day.
[02:32:41.484 --> 02:32:50.332]  If one of them does sell out, I will notify you the day before or the day of the event, so be sure to listen or we'll have a note on the website.
[02:32:51.112 --> 02:32:57.435]  But I'm pretty sure all three shouldn't sell out, though we've had an event before where 200 people were turned away from a single showing.
[02:32:57.495 --> 02:33:02.817]  So it would be advisable to go ahead and go to InfoWars.com and link through and get your tickets.
[02:33:02.837 --> 02:33:04.758]  And if you're bringing a guest, to get their tickets.
[02:33:05.778 --> 02:33:09.620]  Or to get your tickets at the door Friday, June 3rd and Wednesday, June 8th.
[02:33:10.480 --> 02:33:14.002]  And all the locations and maps and details are on InfoWars.com.
[02:33:15.638 --> 02:33:21.692]  And last but not least, you know, many of you live all over the country and can't come to the theater and buy a video or watch the film.
[02:33:22.955 --> 02:33:24.058]  So I would suggest...
[02:33:25.154 --> 02:33:30.717]  But you call and get martial law on 9-11 Rise of the Police State and learn the true nature of the New World Order.
[02:33:31.097 --> 02:33:32.458]  Learn about what they did on 9-11.
[02:33:32.478 --> 02:33:35.259]  Learn about the police state control grid they're setting up.
[02:33:35.319 --> 02:33:36.560]  It's my most powerful film.
[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:37.280]  You need to have it.
[02:33:37.781 --> 02:33:39.341]  The toll-free number to order it when you call.
[02:33:39.381 --> 02:33:41.182]  You can ask for all the specials and discounts.
[02:33:41.723 --> 02:33:44.944]  You can save upwards of 75% on many of the items we offer.
[02:33:47.193 --> 02:33:47.373]  888-253-3139.
[02:33:47.433 --> 02:33:47.974]  That number is 888-253-3139.
[02:33:47.994 --> 02:33:50.376]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:33:50.516 --> 02:33:54.679]  And for $16, I believe that's what we're charging for it, Dr. Dennis Cuddy's book, Cover-Up,
[02:34:12.869 --> 02:34:17.272]  9-11 in Iraq, it's excellent, it's scholarly, but also an easy read, full of quotes and documents.
[02:34:17.852 --> 02:34:19.433]  We have that available as well.
[02:34:19.933 --> 02:34:22.775]  So please get the films, get them, make copies, get them out to folks.
[02:34:23.115 --> 02:34:23.976]  They're very effective.
[02:34:23.996 --> 02:34:32.781]  We're going to prisonplanet.tv and watch all 12 of my films, hundreds of audio interviews, just masses of my weekly TV reports, new ones every week.
[02:34:33.456 --> 02:34:35.818]  My book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other videos.
[02:34:35.978 --> 02:34:37.019]  It's a ridiculous deal.
[02:34:37.519 --> 02:34:39.020]  Text reports that are just for members.
[02:34:39.340 --> 02:34:41.702]  Fifteen cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[02:34:42.562 --> 02:34:44.003]  Going back, I'm going to move quick now.
[02:34:44.083 --> 02:34:45.524]  Dr. Deagle, finish up what you were saying?
[02:34:45.544 --> 02:34:47.886]  That's a perfect segue for my request.
[02:34:48.266 --> 02:34:51.328]  You know that I have my practice in Denver, and I closed it last August.
[02:34:51.829 --> 02:35:00.995]  I live now in Canada, and I'm trying to get your amazing video, and I'm telling everybody you must buy this to not only get the information out, but also to support...
[02:35:01.559 --> 02:35:02.020]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:35:02.040 --> 02:35:02.440]  We're good to go.
[02:35:02.460 --> 02:35:02.680]  I think?
[02:35:24.693 --> 02:35:26.674]  They have some national organizations that want to show this.
[02:35:26.694 --> 02:35:32.938]  Well, I've gotten your emails, Dr. Deagle, and I've told people they can make copies of my films for not-for-sale purposes.
[02:35:33.178 --> 02:35:39.962]  Yeah, what I'd like you to do is be able to support you by... No, I understand, but I'm saying, I mean, you sent me an email and I meant to respond.
[02:35:39.982 --> 02:35:42.243]  You're saying, you know, can you show it in Canada?
[02:35:42.263 --> 02:35:43.003]  Are you authorized?
[02:35:43.584 --> 02:35:47.326]  I mean, I would tentatively say yes, but I have to know the details.
[02:35:47.826 --> 02:35:51.208]  I don't want people getting charged a bunch of money to go see it.
[02:35:51.428 --> 02:35:52.889]  I'm not sure how that would work.
[02:35:53.169 --> 02:35:57.592]  Well, what we want to do is basically cover the cost of theater only because we're trying to get the information out.
[02:35:57.652 --> 02:36:05.996]  And if there's anything extra, get it all back to you directly and have everything accounted by a national... Well, regardless, I just can't ever give total control over my work because I don't know who's in control of it.
[02:36:06.077 --> 02:36:10.799]  Is there a distributor up here that can take care of all those details so that they're... That's another problem.
[02:36:10.859 --> 02:36:12.420]  I'm a very small operation.
[02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:15.062]  I have trouble paying my own little few employees.
[02:36:15.482 --> 02:36:20.705]  If I was able to get somebody that's a national organization contacting you directly and they take care of that, would that be possible?
[02:36:21.485 --> 02:36:23.307]  Yeah, no, I mean, I would love for it to be seen.
[02:36:23.327 --> 02:36:34.156]  I mean, I'll tell you if it's in a city hall or commons, I guess you call them up there, and it's free, then you've got authorization right now.
[02:36:34.916 --> 02:36:41.702]  But I don't want something, I mean, let's say hypothetically, say some socialist group wants to show it and charge money, I don't want to support socialists.
[02:36:41.882 --> 02:36:42.543]  No, no, absolutely not.
[02:36:42.583 --> 02:36:43.724]  No, I'm not saying you would do that.
[02:36:43.764 --> 02:36:46.406]  I'm saying hypothetically I'd have to look at it on a case-by-case basis.
[02:36:46.426 --> 02:36:48.768]  Absolutely, yeah, you've got to make certain that it's not being used because...
[02:36:49.168 --> 02:36:53.210]  What I see happening, and it's exactly what you're saying, we don't want division between the left and right.
[02:36:53.630 --> 02:36:58.552]  We've got to get rid of this divisiveness, and we've got to get back to the basics that all of us are losing our rights here.
[02:36:59.273 --> 02:37:01.794]  Well, Lucian, just get in contact with me, and good to hear from you.
[02:37:01.914 --> 02:37:09.737]  I really appreciate it, and keep on the fight, and everybody support what's going on now, because we don't have a lot of time left before some things happen.
[02:37:09.777 --> 02:37:11.478]  I think they're getting ready for some other events.
[02:37:12.037 --> 02:37:15.280]  Well, I hope you're wrong, but a lot of evidence shows that, and good to hear from you.
[02:37:15.320 --> 02:37:17.121]  I appreciate your work as well.
[02:37:17.822 --> 02:37:20.564]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff and Tejas.
[02:37:20.604 --> 02:37:21.265]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[02:37:21.765 --> 02:37:25.929]  Yes, are you familiar with David J. Smith out of Waxahachie?
[02:37:25.989 --> 02:37:29.512]  Yeah, we've had him on about ten times, and he advertises on this radio show.
[02:37:29.552 --> 02:37:31.614]  Yeah, you're not going to have him on anytime soon?
[02:37:31.634 --> 02:37:31.674]  No.
[02:37:33.356 --> 02:37:33.556]  No.
[02:37:34.429 --> 02:37:35.029]  Well, why not?
[02:37:35.049 --> 02:37:37.050]  Yeah, I'd like to hear him.
[02:37:37.730 --> 02:37:38.570]  Why did you say no?
[02:37:38.650 --> 02:37:39.390]  I don't understand.
[02:37:39.410 --> 02:37:40.671]  Oh, you said ten times.
[02:37:40.731 --> 02:37:43.111]  I thought you might have had him on recently.
[02:37:43.171 --> 02:37:46.072]  Well, I mean, I think in about ten years I've had him on about ten times.
[02:37:47.172 --> 02:37:48.593]  It's always nice to have him on, yeah.
[02:37:48.793 --> 02:37:49.433]  I'd love to hear him.
[02:37:49.953 --> 02:37:54.894]  Do you relate any of the climate of people with the price of gasoline?
[02:37:54.954 --> 02:37:58.495]  As the price goes up, maybe the insanity of the people kind of rises as well?
[02:37:59.085 --> 02:37:59.745]  Well, I know this.
[02:37:59.825 --> 02:38:06.548]  If you take these yuppie women and men's Lexuses away, they'll go absolutely ape and do whatever they're told to get their money back.
[02:38:06.908 --> 02:38:10.190]  And that's all part of getting control of the economy, destroying the economy.
[02:38:10.510 --> 02:38:11.831]  That makes us all dependent.
[02:38:12.431 --> 02:38:17.953]  And, yeah, I mean, we have the Depression, and crime was pretty low, but people helped each other and people had skills.
[02:38:18.333 --> 02:38:22.195]  If there was a Depression now, it would be total and complete bedlam.
[02:38:22.913 --> 02:38:24.256]  Okay, last question.
[02:38:24.577 --> 02:38:26.581]  I want to get you on public access.
[02:38:26.601 --> 02:38:30.530]  Do you suggest any... I have to go through maybe the Time Warner people or something?
[02:38:30.570 --> 02:38:32.254]  Where do you live in Texas?
[02:38:32.334 --> 02:38:33.216]  I'm in Southeast Texas.
[02:38:34.568 --> 02:38:37.030]  Okay, Southeast Texas.
[02:38:38.151 --> 02:38:39.552]  Well, they've got AXS TV.
[02:38:39.572 --> 02:38:40.272]  They've got rules.
[02:38:40.292 --> 02:38:41.453]  You just go ask for their rules.
[02:38:41.493 --> 02:38:48.458]  They have like, I think on the Public Access Channel, they've got the school board information or something like that.
[02:38:48.478 --> 02:38:49.399]  Well, yeah, that's what they do.
[02:38:49.439 --> 02:38:53.622]  In the past, people didn't use it or they didn't advertise it, so then it becomes governmental.
[02:38:53.942 --> 02:38:59.126]  But normally there's clauses where you can get on the air, so I don't know the particular rules of that area.
[02:38:59.326 --> 02:39:03.048]  I'm going to have to go there, read the clause, and see if it's available.
[02:39:03.129 --> 02:39:06.591]  Yeah, and maybe there won't be in that town, but there may be in the town next to it.
[02:39:06.811 --> 02:39:07.211]  Okay.
[02:39:07.331 --> 02:39:10.914]  Because we need to help one another get the word out, as you say.
[02:39:11.134 --> 02:39:14.216]  Look, a senator will fly down to Texas and talk to 1,000 people.
[02:39:14.596 --> 02:39:22.521]  But in a medium-sized city of 40,000 people, where half of them have cable, you get a primetime show, there might be 5,000 people to tune past and watch.
[02:39:22.882 --> 02:39:26.264]  I mean, we've all got an opportunity here, while it's still around, to use it.
[02:39:27.545 --> 02:39:29.166]  By all means possible.
[02:39:30.180 --> 02:39:33.563]  Listen, I get calls, emails, faxes every day.
[02:39:34.103 --> 02:39:36.946]  Prominent people have seen my films on Access in their cities.
[02:39:37.506 --> 02:39:38.727]  Very effective tool.
[02:39:39.027 --> 02:39:41.549]  And there's a lot of other great films to air or get your own show.
[02:39:43.070 --> 02:39:43.551]  Oh, really?
[02:39:43.671 --> 02:39:47.534]  Actually, take calls and etc., right?
[02:39:47.834 --> 02:39:54.359]  And even if you didn't want to stick your face up there, you can just put an image up there or websites up there while you're talking and just do like a radio show.
[02:39:54.379 --> 02:39:54.900]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:55.652 --> 02:39:58.034]  Yeah, maybe I'll get Pastor David J. Smith on the broadcast.
[02:39:58.834 --> 02:40:02.557]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Georgia.
[02:40:03.157 --> 02:40:03.978]  John, go ahead.
[02:40:04.438 --> 02:40:04.938]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:05.279 --> 02:40:08.601]  I'm just calling to tell you about... I'm a veteran.
[02:40:09.542 --> 02:40:11.743]  And what's going on with the VA?
[02:40:11.803 --> 02:40:13.424]  I have a spinal cord injury.
[02:40:13.524 --> 02:40:15.446]  I've been dealing with the VA for three years.
[02:40:15.486 --> 02:40:21.970]  Just tell everybody, they start with the people of a wicked degree, like veterans and people in the projects and stuff who need a little help from the government.
[02:40:22.931 --> 02:40:24.692]  They prescribe me psychotropics.
[02:40:25.180 --> 02:40:30.169]  And tell me I need a psyche valve, even though I have MRIs showing bones.
[02:40:30.290 --> 02:40:32.333]  Well, sir, I mean, I've had people on who've covered this.
[02:40:32.373 --> 02:40:33.195]  This is admitted.
[02:40:34.036 --> 02:40:37.002]  They get paid bonuses for not giving health care.
[02:40:38.244 --> 02:40:43.910]  And if they don't want to operate on you, you have to go to another private doctor.
[02:40:44.330 --> 02:40:45.491]  You have to get a diagnosis.
[02:40:45.511 --> 02:40:47.273]  You have to get copies of your medical records.
[02:40:47.313 --> 02:40:48.314]  By law, they've got to give them to you.
[02:40:48.334 --> 02:40:49.635]  Don't tell them what you're up to, though.
[02:40:49.655 --> 02:40:51.136]  They'll abscond with them.
[02:40:51.497 --> 02:40:53.979]  And then take that and force them to do something.
[02:40:54.740 --> 02:40:59.604]  Do you really want that foreigner that's your doctor with a Cracker Jack degree to operate on your spine?
[02:40:59.964 --> 02:41:01.626]  Every single doctor, I've had three of them.
[02:41:01.926 --> 02:41:02.947]  I've had three different doctors.
[02:41:03.027 --> 02:41:05.109]  Every single one has been Pakistani or Indian.
[02:41:05.129 --> 02:41:05.709]  No, I know.
[02:41:05.729 --> 02:41:07.851]  You're not allowed to be black, Hispanic, or white.
[02:41:08.031 --> 02:41:09.132]  No, I'm not joking.
[02:41:09.152 --> 02:41:10.533]  It is unknown.
[02:41:11.094 --> 02:41:15.838]  You cannot find, unless it's the head of the hospital, an American.
[02:41:16.378 --> 02:41:19.881]  And they've got Cracker Jack degrees, and they cut the wrong legs off, you name it.
[02:41:20.582 --> 02:41:22.203]  I wouldn't want them working on my spine.
[02:41:23.374 --> 02:41:29.319]  I'd take out a loan or get the surgery and do whatever you have to if you need surgery.
[02:41:29.979 --> 02:41:32.021]  I would not want one of those people operating on me.
[02:41:32.041 --> 02:41:35.844]  I just want to tell everybody out there, because we're going to start with the veterans, and it's going to be you next.
[02:41:36.745 --> 02:41:41.569]  Oh, well, they've said all jobs, you think technology jobs, layoffs are bad?
[02:41:41.909 --> 02:41:49.115]  Seven times worse under the new thing Bush wants, unlimited skilled importation of labor.
[02:41:50.336 --> 02:41:51.617]  Can you say unlimited?
[02:41:53.676 --> 02:41:55.797]  Unlimited!
[02:41:55.817 --> 02:42:01.680]  Well, Alex, I just thought I'd tell you that.
[02:42:02.300 --> 02:42:05.142]  All the veterans out there involved in the VA system, get out there and protest.
[02:42:07.679 --> 02:42:09.280]  Totally unresponsive.
[02:42:09.320 --> 02:42:13.742]  They want to give me a psyche valve because I have bones on my spinal cord.
[02:42:13.902 --> 02:42:17.904]  Listen, I remember seeing the testimony in the mid-90s of this Marine Corps captain.
[02:42:17.984 --> 02:42:19.725]  It showed photos of him all big and muscular.
[02:42:20.225 --> 02:42:28.429]  He comes back, DU, the injections, he shrivels up, he can barely talk in a wheelchair, and he goes, They keep telling me I'm in the hill!
[02:42:28.889 --> 02:42:31.431]  He died like a month later.
[02:42:31.532 --> 02:42:37.036]  That's exactly why I'm sitting there crying watching this.
[02:42:53.762 --> 02:42:54.782]  That's exactly what's going on.
[02:42:54.822 --> 02:42:55.463]  I have many friends.
[02:42:55.503 --> 02:42:57.224]  I have guys with Gulf War illness, everything.
[02:42:57.564 --> 02:42:58.985]  They're telling us all we're crazy.
[02:42:59.005 --> 02:43:04.129]  See, the funny thing is, they will give you your compensation if you admit that you are mentally ill.
[02:43:04.509 --> 02:43:07.451]  And then when you try to buy a gun later, sorry.
[02:43:07.571 --> 02:43:09.152]  Yeah, you can't have a gun for me.
[02:43:09.372 --> 02:43:11.794]  I'm afraid you don't have that right.
[02:43:12.395 --> 02:43:16.858]  But see, the people that stick the stickers on their cars saying they support the troops, they don't want to hear about this.
[02:43:17.758 --> 02:43:18.518]  No, they don't.
[02:43:18.598 --> 02:43:22.159]  They don't want to hear about how the Pat Tillman case was made up, or Private Lynch.
[02:43:22.179 --> 02:43:23.780]  They just want to feel good.
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:29.241]  And they're going to feel real good with everything they've got taken by the loving government.
[02:43:29.781 --> 02:43:30.541]  Thanks for the call.
[02:43:30.761 --> 02:43:31.101]  Thank you.
[02:43:31.281 --> 02:43:32.042]  Thank you, John.
[02:43:32.062 --> 02:43:34.002]  And folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:43:34.062 --> 02:43:35.202]  I mean, this is what it's like.
[02:43:35.603 --> 02:43:36.483]  The people shrivel up.
[02:43:36.503 --> 02:43:37.503]  They start having seizures.
[02:43:37.563 --> 02:43:39.163]  They have to be put in diapers.
[02:43:39.203 --> 02:43:41.284]  And then they die, and the family goes and buries them.
[02:43:41.584 --> 02:43:44.985]  And the VA says, Billy was mentally ill.
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:48.442]  Billy was bad.
[02:43:48.462 --> 02:43:51.865]  He didn't take his drugs.
[02:43:51.905 --> 02:43:52.926]  He would have been better.
[02:43:53.766 --> 02:43:55.168]  I mean, folks, it's that sick.
[02:43:55.928 --> 02:43:58.611]  The people that support the troops will go, Shut up, communist!
[02:43:59.271 --> 02:44:00.753]  Well, actually, I'm against communism.
[02:44:01.705 --> 02:44:06.289]  The Pat Tillman case, they killed him, and then they lied about it, and they lied about... Well, that... Shut up!
[02:44:07.049 --> 02:44:09.070]  Well, Bush actually is going to register all the guns now.
[02:44:09.351 --> 02:44:11.652]  Ron Hall says, Shut up, commie!
[02:44:11.672 --> 02:44:12.853]  He's a commie, too!
[02:44:13.474 --> 02:44:14.334]  But I love America.
[02:44:14.955 --> 02:44:16.496]  I'm against, you know, a bigger government.
[02:44:16.556 --> 02:44:17.236]  Shut up!
[02:44:17.857 --> 02:44:20.198]  Well, Bush is involved in Luciferian rituals.
[02:44:20.278 --> 02:44:21.239]  Shut up!
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:24.241]  But, sir, he signed back on to UNESCO.
[02:44:24.281 --> 02:44:25.022]  He's for amnesty.
[02:44:25.402 --> 02:44:26.283]  You're a liar.
[02:44:26.303 --> 02:44:30.025]  I love George W. George W., I love you.
[02:44:32.859 --> 02:44:33.240]  Idiots.
[02:44:34.180 --> 02:44:35.482]  All right, I'm out of control, folks.
[02:44:36.303 --> 02:44:37.123]  Rick in Reno.
[02:44:37.183 --> 02:44:37.864]  Go ahead, Rick.
[02:44:38.265 --> 02:44:46.513]  Gentlemen, with your permission, I would like to read a very short paragraph from Dennis Cuddy's 2004 August 11th article.
[02:44:46.533 --> 02:44:49.476]  Okay, but it's just gentlemen because there's nobody else here.
[02:44:50.723 --> 02:44:53.665]  When Hillary Clinton became First Lady of the U.S.
[02:44:53.885 --> 02:45:03.151]  in 1993, she was in charge of a health care task force, about half the members of whom were connected with the Robert Wood Johnson RWJ Foundation.
[02:45:04.031 --> 02:45:12.897]  On the NBC Today Show, January 23, 1990, Dr. Michael Lewis of the New Jersey Robert Wood Johnson Medical School had claimed...
[02:45:13.425 --> 02:45:21.268]  Lying is an important part of social life, and children who are unable to do it are children who may have developmental problems.
[02:45:21.972 --> 02:45:23.092]  Yes, yes.
[02:45:23.712 --> 02:45:24.533]  Good.
[02:45:25.053 --> 02:45:26.553]  That is insanity right there.
[02:45:26.713 --> 02:45:28.054]  No, no, no.
[02:45:28.314 --> 02:45:30.094]  That's a very revealing paragraph.
[02:45:30.874 --> 02:45:38.676]  Well, look, I mean, I've got the National Calhoun Reader that they use for social workers nationwide for 20 years, and it says, the family is a disease.
[02:45:38.997 --> 02:45:40.397]  It will be destroyed.
[02:45:40.817 --> 02:45:42.637]  They're trying their best to do it, too.
[02:45:43.598 --> 02:45:45.438]  But, see, you're mentally ill.
[02:45:46.439 --> 02:45:47.679]  You're against it.
[02:45:48.968 --> 02:45:50.589]  What's wrong with DU?
[02:45:50.649 --> 02:45:53.672]  I mean, so the Pentagon's own documents say it'll kill the troops.
[02:45:55.233 --> 02:45:57.695]  But you're against the troops because you want to save them.
[02:45:57.715 --> 02:46:00.578]  You've got to learn the new ways.
[02:46:01.038 --> 02:46:02.359]  Keep up the good work, gentlemen.
[02:46:02.800 --> 02:46:03.440]  Hey, Rick?
[02:46:03.700 --> 02:46:03.941]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:03.981 --> 02:46:04.821]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:46:05.142 --> 02:46:05.322]  Go.
[02:46:05.582 --> 02:46:09.625]  I'm being a little bit sarcastic today, but no, I mean, it is getting more and more crazy.
[02:46:10.366 --> 02:46:12.808]  And I know you're not going to let the globalists intimidate you.
[02:46:12.848 --> 02:46:13.989]  Are you going to go down swinging?
[02:46:14.689 --> 02:46:15.150]  Absolutely.
[02:46:16.724 --> 02:46:17.905]  Well, I think they're going to go down.
[02:46:17.945 --> 02:46:18.885]  I think they're going to fail.
[02:46:19.185 --> 02:46:20.706]  They're going down!
[02:46:22.247 --> 02:46:22.668]  Take care.
[02:46:23.548 --> 02:46:23.908]  All right.
[02:46:23.948 --> 02:46:24.729]  Thanks for the call.
[02:46:25.549 --> 02:46:34.515]  You know, to all the people listening out there, I mean, people that serve this system and are afraid to eat down in sides or decide to rationalize and make excuses, that I'm begging you.
[02:46:34.575 --> 02:46:35.335]  I've studied this.
[02:46:35.375 --> 02:46:36.796]  This is all I do is look at this.
[02:46:36.816 --> 02:46:37.696]  And let me tell you something.
[02:46:37.977 --> 02:46:40.278]  It's a lot worse than I can articulate and explain.
[02:46:40.938 --> 02:46:41.939]  I mean, it's bad.
[02:46:42.920 --> 02:46:45.241]  Mucho grande bad.
[02:46:46.184 --> 02:46:49.447]  Christina, last call, because I want to cover a few little tidbits of news.
[02:46:49.867 --> 02:46:51.948]  Christina in Kansas City, you're on the air.
[02:46:52.509 --> 02:46:53.710]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[02:46:53.810 --> 02:47:00.215]  Listen, I remember you used to tell us the odds were 500-1 and we were going to win, and I believe we will.
[02:47:00.495 --> 02:47:02.957]  Well, I said we outnumber the globalists 500-1.
[02:47:03.717 --> 02:47:03.957]  Right.
[02:47:06.519 --> 02:47:07.920]  Thanks for having me on again.
[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:11.143]  Tomorrow night in Kansas City...
[02:47:11.889 --> 02:47:16.911]  At the Johnson County Main Library, we're going to show your film at 6 p.m.
[02:47:16.931 --> 02:47:19.132]  Can I give the address?
[02:47:19.732 --> 02:47:20.352]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:47:20.752 --> 02:47:30.096]  The Johnson County Main Library, everybody in Kansas City, would you please call people you know and tell them so that we can be there and watch this great film of Alex?
[02:47:30.676 --> 02:47:31.157]  6 p.m.
[02:47:31.217 --> 02:47:38.940]  Wednesday night, 9875 West 87th Street in Overland Park, Kansas.
[02:47:39.340 --> 02:47:39.920]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:47:40.606 --> 02:47:42.047]  Alrighty, thank you for the call.
[02:47:42.107 --> 02:47:42.867]  I appreciate it.
[02:47:42.887 --> 02:47:50.031]  I'm glad people are showing the film in high schools and colleges and dormitories and all over the place.
[02:47:50.111 --> 02:47:51.772]  They are showing martial law.
[02:47:52.193 --> 02:47:53.193]  Again, I salute you.
[02:47:53.273 --> 02:47:53.974]  I commend you.
[02:47:54.374 --> 02:47:54.794]  Thank you.
[02:47:54.854 --> 02:47:55.935]  It's a powerful film.
[02:47:57.276 --> 02:48:03.099]  Jeff Rent said last night, I sent him a copy, he said it's the most powerful film he has ever seen.
[02:48:04.884 --> 02:48:06.665]  And a lot of people were saying that.
[02:48:06.705 --> 02:48:08.426]  They were saying Road to Tyranny was the best.
[02:48:08.466 --> 02:48:11.287]  Well, this trumps it in spades.
[02:48:12.508 --> 02:48:14.369]  And I hope you'll have Truck with us.
[02:48:15.109 --> 02:48:18.651]  I hope that you'll have Sucker with us.
[02:48:18.791 --> 02:48:23.853]  I hope that you'll Traffic with us in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:48:24.994 --> 02:48:29.516]  Because this film is powerful, and it's something all of you need.
[02:48:31.157 --> 02:48:33.378]  Ride out, my friends, against the enemy.
[02:48:34.551 --> 02:48:41.374]  Fight him in the full blazing rays of the sun, out in the open, not in the darkness.
[02:48:42.214 --> 02:48:42.835]  Be right back.
[02:48:45.456 --> 02:48:49.797]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:49.978 --> 02:48:54.399]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.539 --> 02:48:58.941]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:58.981 --> 02:49:00.302]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.063 --> 02:49:06.325]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.385 --> 02:49:13.308]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.448 --> 02:49:15.509]  You will lose your liberty.

[02:52:06.650 --> 02:52:11.794]  Oh my goodness, there is a lot of news here I want to hit in the final minutes of this transmission.
[02:52:12.215 --> 02:52:14.917]  Deadly car bomb explodes near Iraqi school.
[02:52:15.557 --> 02:52:23.424]  A car bomb exploded today near a Baghdad junior high school for girls, killing six people and eight American soldiers were killed in two days of insurgent attacks.
[02:52:23.864 --> 02:52:27.307]  In and around Baghdad, the military said that the mission has been accomplished.
[02:52:27.727 --> 02:52:31.731]  In the last two days, the military announced that 13 American troops have been killed since Sunday.
[02:52:32.481 --> 02:52:41.884]  Those reports came as insurgents carried out a string of explosive suicide attacks and drive-by shootings around the country that also killed 49 Iraqis.
[02:52:43.844 --> 02:52:45.885]  At least 620 people in 43 U.S.
[02:52:45.925 --> 02:52:47.765]  troops have been killed since April 28th.
[02:52:48.365 --> 02:52:54.587]  Prime Minister Jafari announced his new Shiite-dominated government.
[02:52:55.787 --> 02:52:57.828]  Very, very serious.
[02:52:58.917 --> 02:53:01.859]  Black market organ trade in Baghdad's new growth industry.
[02:53:01.879 --> 02:53:03.380]  Look at the fruits of the liberation.
[02:53:04.721 --> 02:53:11.164]  And Ali Hamid quit his job as a taxi driver because he no longer felt safe on Baghdad Street, increasingly desperate for money to help him get married.
[02:53:11.685 --> 02:53:15.107]  He hit on a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity selling one of his kidneys.
[02:53:15.887 --> 02:53:20.090]  At least they didn't kill him and take him like they're doing in some of the camps.
[02:53:21.673 --> 02:53:24.896]  It's all part of the new freedom coming out that the U.S.
[02:53:24.936 --> 02:53:27.518]  government actually sold those photos of the tabloid.
[02:53:27.538 --> 02:53:28.919]  They're now trying to deny it.
[02:53:29.459 --> 02:53:32.582]  Shaddam in his underwear, meant to enrage the Arabs yet again.
[02:53:33.082 --> 02:53:36.145]  Part of the Pentagon program, P2OG, to cause the crisis.
[02:53:37.426 --> 02:53:38.707]  Should have spent an hour on this.
[02:53:38.927 --> 02:53:39.267]  I didn't.
[02:53:39.327 --> 02:53:40.308]  I probably will tomorrow.
[02:53:40.788 --> 02:53:44.491]  Big brother to dictate what you can and cannot photograph, Christian Science Monitor.
[02:53:45.052 --> 02:53:49.015]  And they say there's no law, but they claim that under suspicious activities section of the Patriot Act,
[02:53:49.631 --> 02:53:58.717]  That they can arrest anybody with cameras or photo cameras, video cameras, and that the police just don't care if there's no law.
[02:53:58.737 --> 02:53:59.657]  They're just going to do it.
[02:54:01.478 --> 02:54:04.140]  Talk about total, absolute tyranny in your face.
[02:54:04.160 --> 02:54:09.063]  They're putting up all their cameras, but our cameras, our cameras are evil.
[02:54:10.264 --> 02:54:12.185]  Futurists download the mind by 2050.
[02:54:12.245 --> 02:54:15.487]  The wealthy will be able to download their consciousness into computers by 2050.
[02:54:15.527 --> 02:54:17.608]  The not-so-well-off by 2075.
[02:54:19.304 --> 02:54:24.167]  Claims futurologist Dr. Ian Pearson, head of the futurology unit at BT.
[02:54:25.288 --> 02:54:30.511]  And he gets into all of that Orwellian type, that's Brave New World type stuff.
[02:54:30.531 --> 02:54:34.174]  The top neocon is moving into the top minion at Google.
[02:54:34.234 --> 02:54:37.556]  Very, very scary there, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:39.366 --> 02:54:43.969]  And all is not well, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reports, in the wonderland of North Korea.
[02:54:44.550 --> 02:54:47.892]  Secret North Korean footage suggests nascent descent.
[02:54:48.353 --> 02:54:55.077]  All shaking hands, North Koreans climbed onto the shoulders of a buddy to reach the underside of the bridge as another accomplice stood guard.
[02:54:55.438 --> 02:55:03.964]  He hung a banner denouncing North Korean leader Kim Jong-il in bright red paint, risking their lives because they could be members of Al-Qaeda.
[02:55:04.696 --> 02:55:06.541]  Kim Jong-il must save them from the terrorists.
[02:55:06.922 --> 02:55:13.057]  Then he took out a video camera disguised to look like a carton of cigarettes and filmed his handiwork for posterity.
[02:55:14.076 --> 02:55:18.221]  See the human spirits resisting total freedom like they have in North Korea.
[02:55:18.681 --> 02:55:20.323]  The new term is freedom, not slavery.
[02:55:20.743 --> 02:55:27.851]  Today the North Korean who says he shot the video on behalf of the group called the Freedom Youth League lives in hiding in Thailand under the assumed name.
[02:55:27.871 --> 02:55:35.779]  A small, wiry man in his 30s, he smoked L&M cigarettes nervously as he recalled his daring feat against the totalitarian government.
[02:55:36.306 --> 02:55:38.167]  Why don't we all go out and do the same thing?
[02:55:38.207 --> 02:55:39.608]  I think I'll do that sometime soon.
[02:55:40.129 --> 02:55:42.070]  Go out and hang a banner up over the highway.
[02:55:42.671 --> 02:55:43.911]  Every little bit counts.
[02:55:43.951 --> 02:55:47.754]  We should practice as we enter the dark times for these types of resistance.
[02:55:47.794 --> 02:55:49.956]  Of course, they're putting up the cameras to track all of that.
[02:55:50.436 --> 02:55:51.577]  There's ways to get around it.
[02:55:51.977 --> 02:55:53.238]  We are never going to stop.
[02:55:53.898 --> 02:55:55.079]  I will follow this course.
[02:55:55.179 --> 02:55:56.240]  I am committed to it.
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:00.343]  I am sworn to it before my Creator to resist tyranny.
[02:56:01.218 --> 02:56:06.560]  I ask that God lead, guide, and direct all of us and strengthen all of us for what we face.
[02:56:06.580 --> 02:56:17.285]  But together with God's help, we have a great chance of resisting the New World Order and waking a lot of people up so they're not sucked in by this evil, anti-Christ world government system.
[02:56:18.446 --> 02:56:20.547]  The New World Order is upon us, my friends.
[02:56:21.307 --> 02:56:28.430]  We have a job to do resisting it and warning others for humanity and posterity and the future of our children and their children.
[02:56:29.350 --> 02:56:30.235]  God bless you all.
[02:56:30.275 --> 02:56:31.523]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:31.563 --> 02:56:32.388]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
