[00:00:05.535 --> 00:00:06.175]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.836 --> 00:00:07.876]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:09.777]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:11.218]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.938 --> 00:00:12.839]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.201]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.681 --> 00:00:21.843]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.985 --> 00:00:28.126]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:34.669]  It is very fortuitous that you have joined us on this Monday edition, the 10th day...
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.741]  Of January 2005.
[00:00:41.603 --> 00:00:56.431]  Because I can think of a few other days, it's always a Monday though this happens on, where I have more out-of-control, in-your-face, mainstream news admitting the world government, admitting the tyranny.
[00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:58.212]  It's just everywhere.
[00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:00.853]  I have over 100 news articles
[00:01:04.486 --> 00:01:08.690]  In front of me, that I printed off this weekend alone.
[00:01:10.892 --> 00:01:17.918]  From InfoWars.com, from PrisonPlanet.com, from Drudge, and all the others.
[00:01:20.621 --> 00:01:22.182]  There's so many of them!
[00:01:22.903 --> 00:01:27.747]  And some people go, oh, Alex Jones, you know, his views, his opinions on things.
[00:01:27.927 --> 00:01:29.629]  They're not my views and opinions!
[00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.321]  The government is putting cameras in school bathrooms, training us how to live in Big Brother World.
[00:01:36.601 --> 00:01:38.841]  They are coming out with a national ID card.
[00:01:39.081 --> 00:01:45.082]  They are going to send out all these Homeland Security blimps to look through our walls with ground-penetrating radar.
[00:01:45.862 --> 00:01:49.203]  Our government is torturing people all over the world.
[00:01:51.683 --> 00:01:53.424]  All of this stuff is really going on.
[00:01:54.724 --> 00:01:56.964]  And I've got just so much today.
[00:01:57.424 --> 00:02:01.105]  Pundits' role in education propaganda draws ire.
[00:02:01.972 --> 00:02:02.973]  Column cut.
[00:02:03.673 --> 00:02:10.056]  Armstrong Williams got $240,000 to go out and peddle propaganda.
[00:02:12.877 --> 00:02:23.602]  The socialistic no child left behind, that is no child not put on Ritalin or Prozac, no child not broken up with her family, no child not taught how to be institutionalized and be a prisoner.
[00:02:26.784 --> 00:02:28.645]  Now, why did this come out?
[00:02:30.665 --> 00:02:31.746]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:02:33.078 --> 00:02:41.321]  There are thousands of commentators and newspaper writers who are paid by the U.S.
[00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:41.701]  government.
[00:02:42.721 --> 00:02:43.681]  Why did this come out?
[00:02:45.542 --> 00:02:54.405]  Well, I think quite clearly they now, because they've paid everybody off, want to start blackmailing people with money they gave them.
[00:02:54.425 --> 00:02:56.305]  And Mr. Williams is the example of this.
[00:02:57.286 --> 00:02:59.846]  Now, I'm about 95% sure on this, folks.
[00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:01.307]  He's a sacrificial lamb.
[00:03:03.621 --> 00:03:04.761]  Or goat, I should say.
[00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:07.882]  That's what's going on.
[00:03:07.902 --> 00:03:09.243]  I mean, do we forget?
[00:03:11.023 --> 00:03:17.905]  Do we forget 70-plus million a year and a half ago for fake newscasts?
[00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:28.208]  Fake newscasts paid almost all the big networks and aired on cable channels, and that's a payoff.
[00:03:30.362 --> 00:03:34.083]  Not just the propaganda, the Bush-worshipping propaganda.
[00:03:34.844 --> 00:03:35.624]  Totally illegal.
[00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:42.226]  But it's also a payoff to these stations, broadcast stations, careful stations that carried it.
[00:03:44.087 --> 00:03:47.448]  So, we'll go over just some of the background.
[00:03:47.468 --> 00:03:49.689]  And Clinton did this, too.
[00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.311]  And again, that doesn't absolve either party.
[00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:54.991]  It's worse that they're all involved.
[00:03:55.271 --> 00:03:56.672]  It shows how systemic...
[00:03:57.498 --> 00:03:59.180]  How system-wide all of this is.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.243]  Okay, this is just one group of like five stories I want to go over.
[00:04:03.624 --> 00:04:14.494]  The latest story about Armstrong Williams, and then there's four different flashbacks that I could just think of this weekend, and I called Paul up, the webmaster, and said, hey, post these along with it.
[00:04:17.537 --> 00:04:19.438]  But why do they focus in on a guy who got $240,000?
[00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:20.900]  I mean, that's nothing.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.181]  That's nothing.
[00:04:23.866 --> 00:04:29.670]  It's like they'll focus in on some army captain who buys 10 computers with the army credit card and sells them.
[00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:38.255]  But then they'll ignore, you know, a trillion-two being systematically stolen by select corporations.
[00:04:38.935 --> 00:04:39.876]  Trillion-two.
[00:04:40.576 --> 00:04:41.917]  Trillion-200 billion.
[00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:47.401]  Well, this is how they operate, and boy, I bet the rest of the media is real scared right now.
[00:04:48.201 --> 00:04:49.102]  Got those checks.
[00:04:51.463 --> 00:04:52.544]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:54.810]  Stay with us.
[00:04:55.611 --> 00:04:58.454]  President Blunt Adopt TV has been updated for you as well.
[00:05:00.976 --> 00:05:05.340]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:09.925]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.065 --> 00:05:14.469]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:15.851]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:17.312]  Panamers.
[00:05:17.633 --> 00:05:21.858]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:28.868]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.968 --> 00:05:30.971]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.271 --> 00:05:35.992]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:36.012 --> 00:05:37.672]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:37.692 --> 00:05:38.632]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:38.652 --> 00:05:38.932]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:38.972 --> 00:05:39.993]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:06.233]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:06.573 --> 00:06:10.655]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:11.516]  We listened.
[00:06:11.816 --> 00:06:16.799]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:17.079 --> 00:06:17.559]  We listened.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.981]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:21.422 --> 00:06:21.942]  We listened.
[00:06:22.402 --> 00:06:26.466]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:06:26.846 --> 00:06:27.327]  We listened.
[00:06:27.687 --> 00:06:32.932]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:06:33.332 --> 00:06:34.693]  Again, we listened.
[00:06:35.054 --> 00:06:42.440]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans and made in America.
[00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:47.145]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:51.761]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.781 --> 00:06:52.864]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:01.087 --> 00:07:02.548]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:07:02.768 --> 00:07:10.113]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:07:10.413 --> 00:07:14.836]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:07:15.096 --> 00:07:24.942]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:07:25.703 --> 00:07:29.367]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:07:29.687 --> 00:07:32.170]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:38.417]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[00:07:38.657 --> 00:07:40.179]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[00:07:40.179 --> 00:07:40.799]  Big Brother.
[00:07:40.879 --> 00:07:41.560]  Mainstream Media.
[00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.540]  Government Cover-Ups.
[00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:11.171]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.911 --> 00:08:12.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.493 --> 00:08:17.476]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.676 --> 00:08:21.820]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:36.632]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, second segment, eight minutes.
[00:08:38.806 --> 00:08:41.468]  39 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:42.028 --> 00:08:43.349]  Wide open phones today.
[00:08:43.429 --> 00:08:49.573]  Any topic, any news item, any question you've got, we'd love to hear from you.
[00:08:49.593 --> 00:08:49.894]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:50.174 --> 00:08:58.520]  And again, InfoWars.com and InfoWars.net are two of the great websites.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.643]  Two different webmasters for those sites, by the way, so you see a lot of different news on both sites.
[00:09:03.743 --> 00:09:07.226]  Both well worth a visit per site daily.
[00:09:08.197 --> 00:09:13.959]  Alright, let me just try to... Man, I could spend two hours, literally, on this first group of articles.
[00:09:15.939 --> 00:09:18.780]  I'm sure you've already heard about Armstrong-Williams.
[00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:26.103]  Headline, Commentator paid by Bush administration admits error.
[00:09:27.623 --> 00:09:29.964]  Conservative commentator Armstrong-Williams.
[00:09:29.984 --> 00:09:31.844]  Yeah, I would call him ultra-liberal.
[00:09:32.444 --> 00:09:32.985]  I'm serious.
[00:09:33.065 --> 00:09:37.206]  He's for the brainwashing, no child...
[00:09:38.186 --> 00:09:39.507]  Left Free Initiative.
[00:09:40.308 --> 00:09:42.189]  Bush is so proud of Bill Clinton's baby.
[00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:51.017]  Conservative commentator Armstrong Williams said Friday he should have disclosed that he was paid by the Bush administration to plug the No Child Left Behind Act.
[00:09:52.218 --> 00:09:58.163]  But the individual said he would not give back the $240,000 he was paid by the U.S.
[00:09:58.203 --> 00:09:59.464]  Department of Education.
[00:10:00.871 --> 00:10:12.297]  USA Today reported that the contract Friday, prompting a barrage of protests from Democrats, journalists, and government watchdogs who condemned Williams and the White House for co-opting the media.
[00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:15.058]  The ethical issue is a failure of disclosure.
[00:10:15.618 --> 00:10:26.003]  USC journalism professor Ernest Wiggins said he should have been more forthcoming in telling his readers and viewers that he has been contracted to promote the White House.
[00:10:26.643 --> 00:10:27.824]  Let me just stop right there.
[00:10:29.514 --> 00:10:30.755]  This is illegal, folks.
[00:10:30.775 --> 00:10:32.977]  There's a whole bunch of federal and state laws on this.
[00:10:34.719 --> 00:10:40.424]  To have a political party, and that's what the White House is.
[00:10:40.484 --> 00:10:41.505]  It's the Republican Party.
[00:10:42.326 --> 00:10:42.927]  The head of it.
[00:10:42.967 --> 00:10:43.848]  The executive of it.
[00:10:44.528 --> 00:10:45.049]  To have it.
[00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:47.411]  Giving funds.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:11:02.545]  To someone who is a supposed independent commentator to write articles and do radio shows and TV shows and to go out there and act like it's their idea and that they even believe in it, that is, there's just all sorts of laws that violates.
[00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:17.530]  It's amazing, but it's like it's illegal for Anthony Scalia to go flying around Air Force Two with Dick Cheney on two separate hunting trips in the month before
[00:11:19.737 --> 00:11:29.045]  The Supreme Court was to hear the energy document hearing case where the court did rule, no, you can keep all that secret.
[00:11:29.885 --> 00:11:39.353]  Despite the fact that cabinet witnesses said that he was in there with maps of the oil fields and divvying up who would get what oil according to what campaign contribution.
[00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:40.594]  I mean, it's criminal!
[00:11:42.168 --> 00:11:54.235]  But the oil situation was criminal, but flying around with people, all-expense-paid trips with people that are going to be sitting before your court is illegal.
[00:11:55.736 --> 00:12:07.202]  It's like two weeks ago, Houston Chronicle came out, Casper Star Tribune came out with, well, Clarence Thomas, Supreme Court Justice, having his $10,000 a year deal.
[00:12:09.022 --> 00:12:18.064]  Bohemian Grove dues paid, being flown around on private jets to the Bohemian Grove by companies that were before the high court.
[00:12:18.864 --> 00:12:20.205]  It's totally illegal.
[00:12:20.605 --> 00:12:22.685]  But again, they're the government, so they can do it.
[00:12:23.506 --> 00:12:24.506]  But don't you do it.
[00:12:25.446 --> 00:12:26.946]  You're some low-level crook.
[00:12:27.967 --> 00:12:30.847]  Don't you fly the judge for an all-expense-paid trip.
[00:12:31.928 --> 00:12:34.668]  Don't you do it, because you'll go to prison, and you should.
[00:12:35.468 --> 00:12:37.889]  Maybe you shouldn't, if the big criminals get away with it.
[00:12:38.701 --> 00:12:42.003]  So, we've got this Armstrong-Williams situation.
[00:12:44.904 --> 00:12:48.345]  Well, let's give you some more serious examples.
[00:12:49.726 --> 00:12:51.107]  The really important stuff.
[00:12:51.387 --> 00:12:53.067]  This is out of the LA Times.
[00:12:55.308 --> 00:12:56.249]  LA Times.
[00:12:56.349 --> 00:13:00.251]  Bush administration's fake news reports on Medicare illegal.
[00:13:01.011 --> 00:13:03.372]  Mock news reports produced and distributed...
[00:13:04.082 --> 00:13:20.312]  To local television stations by the Bush administration to promote the Medicare prescription drug program violated a provision of federal law that prohibits the use of taxpayer funds for covert propaganda, the General Accounting Office determined Wednesday.
[00:13:21.173 --> 00:13:21.413]  Again.
[00:13:23.194 --> 00:13:25.135]  Violated a provision of federal law.
[00:13:25.476 --> 00:13:26.796]  That means broke the law.
[00:13:27.177 --> 00:13:28.638]  Same thing with Armstrong-Williams.
[00:13:28.998 --> 00:13:30.699]  That prohibits the use of taxpayer money...
[00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:33.757]  Funds for covert propaganda.
[00:13:33.777 --> 00:13:34.579]  That's from the law.
[00:13:34.599 --> 00:13:38.832]  The General Accounting Office determined Wednesday, and this is a year ago.
[00:13:40.074 --> 00:13:58.960]  The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, noted that the administration had labeled its entire video news release package so that the 126 television stations receiving it would know that it came from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:13:59.401 --> 00:14:09.524]  But the fact was not apparent in the 41 million seniors and disabled Medicare beneficiaries who were the target of the purported news story.
[00:14:11.386 --> 00:14:27.177]  And again, there is actually law that when you're airing an infomercial, several different federal and state laws that I know of, that when you're airing an infomercial on broadcast TV or radio, you are to state the name of the company and that it is a paid advertiser.
[00:14:27.717 --> 00:14:29.158]  We've all heard that and seen that.
[00:14:29.718 --> 00:14:38.344]  Whether it's Anthony Robbins or somebody selling some new carpet cleaner, regardless of what it is, you do that.
[00:14:39.722 --> 00:14:40.403]  It is paid.
[00:14:40.543 --> 00:14:41.884]  It is an advertisement.
[00:14:42.505 --> 00:14:46.108]  You are to note that it is an advertisement.
[00:14:46.508 --> 00:14:54.075]  You don't particularly have to do that in hyperlinks on the Internet, though it is unethical to not have under it that it's an advertisement.
[00:14:54.396 --> 00:14:57.238]  But then when the government gets involved... Now, understand.
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:02.123]  They spent over $70 million.
[00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:04.245]  You can go read these articles in full.
[00:15:05.428 --> 00:15:07.609]  I was out of VHS tape.
[00:15:07.629 --> 00:15:10.431]  I almost went to the store and bought some more.
[00:15:26.689 --> 00:15:29.191]  I remember watching it going, what is this?
[00:15:29.512 --> 00:15:33.094]  It was, Bush cares about the people and they're very happy with him.
[00:15:33.154 --> 00:15:35.576]  It's the best reform bill ever known.
[00:15:35.616 --> 00:15:40.820]  It was like newscasters, old fancy desks, showing video clips of people clapping for Bush.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.421]  Of course, it wasn't real clapping.
[00:15:42.441 --> 00:15:46.284]  They would just take shots of old people clapping and then insert it in.
[00:15:46.304 --> 00:15:48.825]  It was also a falsified news report.
[00:15:49.086 --> 00:15:50.767]  It wasn't just a fake news report.
[00:15:51.619 --> 00:15:53.260]  In that it wasn't a real news agency.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.943]  It also had fake cuts and all this stuff going on in it.
[00:15:58.184 --> 00:16:00.545]  Any other media outlet would get in a lot of trouble for that.
[00:16:01.286 --> 00:16:05.169]  So it was also fabricated at that level in the actual content.
[00:16:05.869 --> 00:16:11.994]  It was 70 plus million dollars for one media buy.
[00:16:12.074 --> 00:16:12.514]  Now listen.
[00:16:14.178 --> 00:16:15.539]  I know local radio stations, my friends, in Central Texas...
[00:16:43.334 --> 00:16:43.934]  How do I know?
[00:16:43.994 --> 00:16:49.816]  Because I've called up board operators and demanded to speak to managers and found out.
[00:16:49.836 --> 00:17:12.801]  I mean, I've heard these newscasts where it's a local environmental group that has federal and state funding and you hear like a special three or four minute newscast for them about how we've got to go ahead and put more emissions controls and standards on our cars and have emissions testing
[00:17:13.863 --> 00:17:17.705]  And I know the feds are doing this all over the country to actually bring in a new level of taxation.
[00:17:19.346 --> 00:17:21.908]  And so I called up and I said, that's paid, isn't it?
[00:17:22.568 --> 00:17:24.509]  And the person's like, hi, let me talk to your manager.
[00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:26.631]  And I get somebody else going, listen, I just want to know this.
[00:17:26.651 --> 00:17:27.491]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:28.852]  Just tell me the truth.
[00:17:28.892 --> 00:17:29.532]  I want to know this.
[00:17:30.553 --> 00:17:32.754]  Is that in your traffic report?
[00:17:32.874 --> 00:17:35.816]  And that's what it's called on radio on the computer, the ads.
[00:17:36.657 --> 00:17:38.378]  And he's like, yeah, yeah.
[00:17:38.458 --> 00:17:39.218]  How did you know that?
[00:17:40.019 --> 00:17:40.719]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:17:40.779 --> 00:17:42.260]  It's not hard to know it.
[00:17:43.047 --> 00:17:43.627]  And you know what?
[00:17:43.807 --> 00:17:47.508]  I'm sick and tired of this type of garbage.
[00:17:47.568 --> 00:17:55.370]  I mean, when I have somebody on to promote a water filter I believe in, or when I'm selling my books and videos, it's, hey, here's a product.
[00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.270]  I want you to buy it.
[00:17:57.111 --> 00:18:03.212]  I don't masquerade around like it's a news report.
[00:18:03.872 --> 00:18:05.313]  And now with the news, call 888-253-3139.
[00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:06.753]  It's called product placement.
[00:18:11.377 --> 00:18:18.242]  Okay, when you're watching a movie and there's Budweiser and Doritos and Domino's Pizza ads in the movie.
[00:18:19.163 --> 00:18:28.290]  Some movies make over... Well, there's one TV show that got 30 plus million dollars just for, what was it, four or five episodes?
[00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:33.073]  That was The Apprentice or whatever the show is with Donald Trump.
[00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:35.635]  I've only watched it like once, but I remember reading the article.
[00:18:36.075 --> 00:18:38.477]  That's called product placement.
[00:18:38.497 --> 00:18:39.638]  I don't have a problem with it.
[00:18:40.734 --> 00:18:47.580]  Other than the fact that it's annoying, and some shows have turned into nothing but product placement, but people just take it in because they're not conscious of it.
[00:18:48.001 --> 00:18:54.687]  What I do have a problem with is the term I coined, and that is propaganda placement.
[00:18:56.228 --> 00:18:57.089]  That's my term.
[00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.152]  Propaganda placement.
[00:19:01.213 --> 00:19:06.958]  And so, the yuppies in the general public will argue with you about propaganda in the news and TV.
[00:19:09.875 --> 00:19:13.156]  And then if you point out propaganda placement to them, they'll just say, so what?
[00:19:13.616 --> 00:19:28.521]  I mean, folks, you like watching TV, and you have no idea that the managers of radio and TV stations, in many cases, have actually been given federal stipends to run around and have a certain view?
[00:19:28.541 --> 00:19:31.922]  I mean, it is widespread.
[00:19:32.862 --> 00:19:38.204]  It's in your town, if you live in a moderately large city.
[00:19:40.018 --> 00:19:43.060]  It's going on across the board.
[00:19:44.361 --> 00:19:47.224]  And why are they now bringing out Armstrong Williams?
[00:19:48.244 --> 00:19:55.690]  I believe this was released on purpose, and I believe now the government is going to move ahead with blackmailing members of the media who've taken money.
[00:19:56.471 --> 00:19:57.992]  Yes, it's that dirty, folks.
[00:19:58.032 --> 00:19:58.492]  We'll be back.
[00:20:02.815 --> 00:20:04.917]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:20:05.658 --> 00:20:09.141]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:20:09.741 --> 00:20:13.284]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[00:20:13.944 --> 00:20:16.546]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:19.388]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:20:19.889 --> 00:20:21.310]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:23.751]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[00:20:24.292 --> 00:20:25.252]  Check with your doctor.
[00:20:25.353 --> 00:20:30.256]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:20:30.736 --> 00:20:35.420]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights
[00:20:36.087 --> 00:20:36.908]  Light up your life.
[00:20:37.008 --> 00:20:39.750]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with the Northern Light.

[00:23:00.757 --> 00:23:01.438]  Hello, folks.

[00:23:48.933 --> 00:23:52.394]  All right, Bill and John and Jason and Sherry and Adam, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:23:52.434 --> 00:23:54.795]  But again, I just spent about 15 minutes on one story.
[00:24:17.981 --> 00:24:19.082]  Or one phenomenon.
[00:24:19.102 --> 00:24:28.946]  I mean, you tell the average person that the newscasts are actually, in many cases, run by the government.
[00:24:30.086 --> 00:24:30.747]  Paid for.
[00:24:30.807 --> 00:24:31.547]  They don't want to believe it.
[00:24:31.907 --> 00:24:36.309]  It's not just that the corporations that own and run our politicians own that same media.
[00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:38.170]  It's CNN.
[00:24:38.270 --> 00:24:46.694]  I remember a Washington Post, World Net Daily article back in, what, 2000, where it talked about hundreds and hundreds of members
[00:24:48.304 --> 00:24:53.225]  Of Army Psychological Warfare Group in CNN.
[00:24:55.445 --> 00:25:03.087]  And then Gore Vidal, the big prize-winning writer, he was there right after 9-11, and he goes, I just want to compliment CNN.
[00:25:03.107 --> 00:25:04.987]  He goes, this is the first time I've been in a U.S.
[00:25:05.047 --> 00:25:14.709]  newsroom in the last few years and haven't had lieutenant generals in suits telling me what I can and can't say.
[00:25:18.624 --> 00:25:21.665]  And the commentators said, oh, no, we don't do that anymore.
[00:25:22.705 --> 00:25:27.006]  Folks, you can say, well, then why are you reading mainstream news?
[00:25:28.806 --> 00:25:32.467]  Well, because we'll read an article where they say, children need microchips.
[00:25:32.907 --> 00:25:34.207]  Why, this will be the new ID.
[00:25:34.607 --> 00:25:35.327]  It's good.
[00:25:35.788 --> 00:25:37.708]  We go, no, it's bad, and here's why.
[00:25:40.288 --> 00:25:47.630]  Or we read an article where they taser an 85-year-old man because he didn't stop his car quick enough because he was deaf, basically, or hearing impaired.
[00:25:49.441 --> 00:25:53.123]  And, you know, they say it's no big deal, proper way to handle it.
[00:25:53.664 --> 00:25:56.345]  We read the facts and go, no, this isn't the proper way to handle it.
[00:25:56.385 --> 00:25:58.587]  And, you know, all the media isn't controlled and bought.
[00:25:59.147 --> 00:26:05.051]  What happens is, is the low-level writers and local writers and local people, they all copy the big pundits.
[00:26:05.591 --> 00:26:05.831]  Why?
[00:26:05.871 --> 00:26:12.215]  Because they're told by their editor or by their program director, that's how you rise to the top.
[00:26:12.315 --> 00:26:13.556]  You duplicate this.
[00:26:15.839 --> 00:26:22.706]  And actually, that's how you live in mediocrity and never get noticed and basically regurgitate what you heard somebody else say.
[00:26:24.888 --> 00:26:31.173]  And so, the big pundits and the Bill O'Reillys and the Limbaughs and the rest of them... You know, Limbaughs paid more than a show brings in.
[00:26:31.614 --> 00:26:33.095]  I'll be a little sign for you there.
[00:26:34.296 --> 00:26:34.557]  But, uh...
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:38.740]  And it goes, well, it's like Gloria Steinem.
[00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:42.881]  She wrote a book and admitted, oh, I was a CIA officer to start Miss Magazine.
[00:26:42.901 --> 00:26:44.562]  The feminist movement was controlled by it.
[00:26:44.582 --> 00:26:55.984]  You've got to break up the family, drive a wedge between it, to make sure that women were out of the house so the state could raise the children so you'd have two people paying taxes.
[00:26:56.464 --> 00:26:58.545]  And again, I'm not saying it's bad if women want to go work.
[00:26:58.845 --> 00:27:01.385]  The point is a system being built where you have to is wrong.
[00:27:02.186 --> 00:27:03.486]  And Gloria Steinem...
[00:27:04.625 --> 00:27:08.888]  You know, the founder of NOW and the big cheese over with the feminist movement.
[00:27:09.408 --> 00:27:11.090]  You know, she's off married now with kids.
[00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:13.611]  The point is they're hypocrites, folks.
[00:27:15.192 --> 00:27:16.313]  They're social engineers.
[00:27:16.393 --> 00:27:26.100]  So it's the left and on the right, I mean, they're all a theater crew, a gaggle of thespians of actors manipulating you.
[00:27:30.746 --> 00:27:36.892]  I mean, if Bush is dropping 70-plus mil, I keep saying 70-plus, I've got to dig in the article, it's either 76 or 79.
[00:27:37.012 --> 00:27:39.054]  I'll find it in a second.
[00:27:40.075 --> 00:27:47.002]  Just for one media buy on one federal program, the prescription drug benefit, a fake newscast.
[00:27:47.523 --> 00:27:50.286]  Not telling you it's government produced, but with fake cuts.
[00:27:51.127 --> 00:27:51.907]  Not just the fact that...
[00:27:53.829 --> 00:27:56.390]  And now we're going to hear about Armstrong Williams all day.
[00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:58.691]  And I'll just say this, and we'll go to break and come back.
[00:27:58.711 --> 00:27:59.612]  Go straight to your calls.
[00:27:59.912 --> 00:28:00.772]  Straight to your calls.
[00:28:03.213 --> 00:28:03.854]  I'll just say this.
[00:28:06.455 --> 00:28:07.756]  It's very suspicious.
[00:28:08.156 --> 00:28:11.657]  This is a very sophisticated media formula that the globalists have.
[00:28:12.218 --> 00:28:19.041]  USA Today is basically their mouthpiece, I've noticed, for key distribution in print media, even more so than the New York Times these days.
[00:28:21.301 --> 00:28:23.642]  And I believe this was leaked and brought out.
[00:28:24.462 --> 00:28:28.943]  I'm not even saying the reporters involved, but a lot of times they're unwilling, useful idiots.
[00:28:30.444 --> 00:28:31.724]  Because I have to question this.
[00:28:31.984 --> 00:28:35.145]  If this stuff doesn't come out on accident, big marquee papers like that.
[00:28:35.425 --> 00:28:41.767]  It could be a real article by a real investigative journalist if it came out in some regional paper or some local paper and never got picked up.
[00:28:42.987 --> 00:28:45.468]  I believe they're bringing this out for a climate...
[00:28:47.494 --> 00:29:10.667]  Number one, so conservatives can be acclimated and so conservative pundits can defend payoffs and somehow start normalizing this form of graft, this form of more Dito, beak-dipping, Pentagon, Office of Strategic Influence, whatever term you want to use or name you want to call it, either technical or provincial.
[00:29:12.188 --> 00:29:12.388]  But
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.961]  I believe this is being brought out so key people can be blackmailed.
[00:29:18.001 --> 00:29:21.422]  That is, the thousands of members of the media that have been paid off.
[00:29:22.622 --> 00:29:26.643]  A lot of them idiotically didn't even know it was illegal and were just told, be quiet about this.
[00:29:27.323 --> 00:29:28.063]  You'll get more.
[00:29:30.844 --> 00:29:32.645]  And this is one of the big no-no's, folks.
[00:29:32.665 --> 00:29:34.125]  You're not supposed to talk about this.
[00:29:34.705 --> 00:29:42.787]  You know, most of your anchors in your towns and cities, they actually have to make payoffs in the reverse order to get that job.
[00:29:44.602 --> 00:29:46.645]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:29:46.665 --> 00:29:47.407]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.493 --> 00:29:52.435]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.895 --> 00:29:54.498]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.518 --> 00:29:58.124]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.403 --> 00:30:03.024]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:30:03.164 --> 00:30:07.228]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:30:07.408 --> 00:30:10.290]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:17.095]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:30:17.255 --> 00:30:20.278]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:30:20.478 --> 00:30:22.880]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:31.106]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as apt
[00:30:31.226 --> 00:30:33.127]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:31:03.197 --> 00:31:03.457]  Thank you.

[00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.229]  Call today.
[00:32:01.716 --> 00:32:03.217]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:32:03.277 --> 00:32:05.679]  Whether you were aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:32:06.039 --> 00:32:06.920]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.501]  Oil War III has started.
[00:32:08.821 --> 00:32:11.262]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:32:11.663 --> 00:32:15.085]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:32:15.485 --> 00:32:16.326]  Why else would the U.S.
[00:32:16.366 --> 00:32:19.308]  be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:32:19.568 --> 00:32:20.829]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:32:21.289 --> 00:32:25.772]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:32:26.192 --> 00:32:30.175]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:32:30.695 --> 00:32:36.597]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[00:32:36.857 --> 00:32:42.958]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[00:32:43.458 --> 00:32:43.798]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:32:43.818 --> 00:32:49.700]  After you read the booklet, you will understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:50.380]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.760]  Or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:53.181]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.582]  All right, we're going to go to your calls now.
[00:33:13.643 --> 00:33:18.627]  I mean, I could literally spend the entire broadcast talking about different ways the government pays off the media.
[00:33:20.668 --> 00:33:38.964]  Jerry Bruckheimer, my last comment on this, we'll go to your calls, the big Hollywood producer of Pirates of the Caribbean and Black Hawk Down, was contracted to, in the two days after they learned where Private Lynch was, being taken care of by Iraqi doctors in an area where the Republican Guard had fled...
[00:33:40.404 --> 00:33:49.488]  Was contracted to write a script up and tell the Delta Force people how to go in and save her and what to do and what type of camera shots to engage in.
[00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:55.090]  And they went in and roughed up the people and kicked down doors and did all that.
[00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:59.112]  I mean, that's just another small little smidgen of the manipulation.
[00:34:00.032 --> 00:34:00.793]  And it's a legion.
[00:34:00.833 --> 00:34:08.196]  We have the Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence two and a half years ago coming out and going, we're going to lie to you, we're going to plant fake news reports.
[00:34:09.457 --> 00:34:09.517]  See?
[00:34:09.537 --> 00:34:09.597]  See?
[00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:36.930]  I think they do that in other cases.
[00:34:36.990 --> 00:34:38.471]  Like, oh, we blew up Building 7.
[00:34:38.691 --> 00:34:40.032]  Did you see it on national TV?
[00:34:40.092 --> 00:34:44.996]  And then the government all denies it and somehow they ever get caught or it finally comes out big time.
[00:34:45.176 --> 00:34:46.537]  Well, we told you we blew it up.
[00:34:46.597 --> 00:34:50.540]  It's like after we reported that the government had done drills on 9-11.
[00:34:51.081 --> 00:34:52.562]  We were the first to report it here, by the way.
[00:34:54.523 --> 00:34:58.406]  Of hijacked jets being flown into structures or jets off course.
[00:34:58.426 --> 00:34:59.487]  All these different drills.
[00:35:00.632 --> 00:35:04.775]  After we reported that, the AP came out, the CIA had announced, yeah, we ran some drills.
[00:35:04.816 --> 00:35:06.257]  We're just wanting to announce this for you.
[00:35:06.737 --> 00:35:08.959]  And it was reported as if they had broken it.
[00:35:09.499 --> 00:35:11.961]  They were just letting us know, oh, yes, we did it.
[00:35:11.981 --> 00:35:16.065]  Kind of a psychological inoculation, I think is what I've heard them call it.
[00:35:16.945 --> 00:35:17.806]  Let's take calls.
[00:35:17.846 --> 00:35:18.927]  I'm going to go to Bill first.
[00:35:18.947 --> 00:35:21.569]  I'm going to go to John, Jason, Sherry, Adam, and others.
[00:35:21.929 --> 00:35:23.330]  Bill in Florida, you're on the air.
[00:35:23.370 --> 00:35:23.771]  Go ahead.
[00:35:24.211 --> 00:35:25.192]  Hey, Alex, my brother.
[00:35:25.212 --> 00:35:26.013]  How are you doing, man?
[00:35:26.173 --> 00:35:26.273]  Good.
[00:35:26.293 --> 00:35:26.373]  Good.
[00:35:26.994 --> 00:35:32.796]  First of all, let me thank you for being my best Article 15 I've ever got wrote up on.
[00:35:32.836 --> 00:35:35.438]  You're not one of their fonder people for us to listen to.
[00:35:35.458 --> 00:35:38.359]  You got written up with an Article 15?
[00:35:38.639 --> 00:35:38.919]  Yeah.
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.060]  But it was worth it.
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:42.741]  It was worth it.
[00:35:42.821 --> 00:35:44.461]  Tell folks what an Article 15 is.
[00:35:46.182 --> 00:35:50.844]  When a certain military person or agent of the military...
[00:35:52.409 --> 00:36:12.964]  Sort of goes against current policy or unwritten policy that they feel either endangers military property said being that person or, you know, exposes others to, in my case, some information or as they like to refer to as disinformation that they shouldn't have been privy to at that point.
[00:36:12.984 --> 00:36:20.110]  In other words, I was listening to you while I was on duty and they didn't like it too good.
[00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:21.351]  So what happened with the Article 15?
[00:36:22.650 --> 00:36:22.950]  Nothing.
[00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:27.532]  I just got 15 extra days worth of duty and is the end of it.
[00:36:27.612 --> 00:36:29.092]  Got my hands slapped.
[00:36:29.112 --> 00:36:31.633]  They're not going to do a heck of a lot to us.
[00:36:31.853 --> 00:36:40.616]  I'm lucky my MOS happens to be an area where I'm needed a little better than a lot of other people are at different times.
[00:36:41.276 --> 00:36:44.457]  Well, I have a friend whose brother is in the Marine Corps.
[00:36:44.697 --> 00:36:51.059]  This is like eight years ago, six, seven years ago actually, when he went into the Marines.
[00:36:52.092 --> 00:36:54.734]  He gave them a copy of my first video back in 1997.
[00:36:55.574 --> 00:37:01.138]  And they were all in there watching, and even the sergeant was.
[00:37:01.818 --> 00:37:11.785]  And then some higher-level officer came, and they even had some investigation over it, and they all had to scrub garbage cans and run a bunch of extra laps with packs on their backs.
[00:37:12.065 --> 00:37:13.866]  Oh, I don't doubt that at all.
[00:37:14.446 --> 00:37:18.449]  I worked with an EOD team, and it just...
[00:37:19.005 --> 00:37:19.966]  It was hilarious.
[00:37:20.226 --> 00:37:25.951]  It was a Lieutenant Commander called us listening to you on a little cheap run to FR200 radio.
[00:37:26.191 --> 00:37:27.993]  It was lucky we were picking you up, Clear.
[00:37:28.633 --> 00:37:29.954]  Where were you when this happened?
[00:37:32.156 --> 00:37:34.438]  Let me just say it was overseas.
[00:37:35.459 --> 00:37:39.382]  That way I know I'm not going to get in any other added trouble.
[00:37:40.723 --> 00:37:42.244]  But we were off in the Persian Gulf.
[00:37:42.284 --> 00:37:43.365]  I couldn't give you an exact list.
[00:37:43.385 --> 00:37:47.869]  So did they consider it disinformation that we were talking about depleted uranium?
[00:37:49.125 --> 00:37:58.768]  Well, that was one of the other comments I was going to ask you to try to do is get with Joyce Riley and bring up some of those issues because a lot of guys are coming down sick a lot faster right now.
[00:38:00.648 --> 00:38:06.170]  Well, I mean, the Army's own manuals, same with the Marine Corps' own manuals, say it's deadly.
[00:38:06.190 --> 00:38:09.330]  I mean, it's not like we're saying something radical here.
[00:38:10.091 --> 00:38:10.291]  No.
[00:38:11.291 --> 00:38:15.432]  But, I mean, well, let me give you another example, and it's right here where I'm based out of, and
[00:38:16.175 --> 00:38:24.162]  It'll give you a good laugh anyway, and then I'll clear up the lines for some of the other people, because my main thing was just to thank you for making my days over there worthwhile.
[00:38:24.182 --> 00:38:26.704]  Thank you.
[00:38:27.805 --> 00:38:28.326]  My pleasure.
[00:38:28.346 --> 00:38:30.227]  You're familiar with the John F. Kennedy, right?
[00:38:30.247 --> 00:38:32.389]  The carrier?
[00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:33.951]  Yes.
[00:38:34.051 --> 00:38:36.052]  One of the last ones that's non-nuclear powered.
[00:38:36.072 --> 00:38:42.258]  They just did a big major refit over here a few years ago, and she had a lot of extra problems, but they got her battles ready.
[00:38:43.157 --> 00:38:49.122]  Now when I get home, all over the paper everything's listing they're getting ready to decommission her and get her out of here.
[00:38:50.983 --> 00:38:54.145]  Which would pretty much bankrupt the town of Mayport, Florida.
[00:38:54.325 --> 00:38:58.909]  You know, they depend on the carrier a lot, but why spend all that money for that?
[00:38:58.929 --> 00:39:07.996]  And then they got her slotted too from what I was being told by a maintenance officer to go into another major overhaul up in Norfolk here in the next year.
[00:39:08.636 --> 00:39:10.758]  So you're getting a lot of different conflicting reports.
[00:39:11.645 --> 00:39:17.009]  Just a lot of different excuses for why they're going to spend a lot of money or waste a lot of money.
[00:39:17.029 --> 00:39:19.291]  Do you think it's worthwhile to keep the carrier?
[00:39:20.652 --> 00:39:24.054]  I think they ought to dredge out the base in here and make it nuclear.
[00:39:24.354 --> 00:39:31.239]  I mean, you know, we've got a nuclear sub base just a little north of us, Kings Bay, and the next area is going to be up at Norfolk.
[00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:36.423]  And we actually need some ability to have a nuclear carrier here, I believe.
[00:39:36.443 --> 00:39:37.624]  I mean, you know.
[00:39:37.824 --> 00:39:39.385]  Well, as much as they're using them, they've
[00:39:40.615 --> 00:39:44.356]  I mean, aren't the strains at record levels on the different task force?
[00:39:45.036 --> 00:39:45.556]  Extremely.
[00:39:45.956 --> 00:39:46.536]  Extremely.
[00:39:46.716 --> 00:39:53.178]  And I mean, you know, at any given time, I wouldn't be surprised to see them have to call them to reposition them.
[00:39:53.878 --> 00:40:04.421]  Like I said, my field's a little different than surface warfare, but it wouldn't surprise me at any time to see them pull them out and have to send some over, you know, off the coast there on North Korea.
[00:40:04.481 --> 00:40:07.261]  Are there 12 nuclear carriers?
[00:40:07.281 --> 00:40:08.742]  Twelve of them right now, yes, sir.
[00:40:09.482 --> 00:40:09.922]  And so...
[00:40:11.593 --> 00:40:16.536]  And I've been reading what, ten of them are out to sea normally now?
[00:40:18.998 --> 00:40:20.319]  That sounds reasonable enough.
[00:40:20.379 --> 00:40:21.259]  I couldn't comment.
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:33.167]  And I was reading with the overhauls that they really can't keep their maintenance even at minimal levels unless they only have about six or seven of them out.
[00:40:33.728 --> 00:40:38.691]  You would have died if you could have seen all the problems that Kennedy was going through just to get that already.
[00:40:39.363 --> 00:40:39.523]  Wow.
[00:40:49.537 --> 00:40:52.459]  First day trials were right at the last second before they deployed.
[00:40:52.559 --> 00:40:57.163]  Well, are they going to send you back to Iraq or Saudi Arabia or wherever it is?
[00:40:57.603 --> 00:40:57.923]  Yes, sir.
[00:40:57.943 --> 00:41:01.726]  I'm due to deploy here in about another couple of weeks, it looks like, if not sooner.
[00:41:01.786 --> 00:41:11.753]  My last question for you, sir, is that Rumsfeld memo just came out where they're going, we're going to have to keep people in, not for 24 months, but perhaps four years.
[00:41:12.434 --> 00:41:14.895]  And that's just for the guard individuals.
[00:41:14.915 --> 00:41:16.456]  I'm sure you've heard of that.
[00:41:16.476 --> 00:41:17.157]  Oh, yeah.
[00:41:17.597 --> 00:41:18.138]  It is...
[00:41:18.778 --> 00:41:19.759]  That making people happy?
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:24.583]  Well, most of the people I encounter are non-reservists.
[00:41:26.405 --> 00:41:32.190]  Even, you know, we're all brothers and sisters there, regardless, you know, reserve or non-reserve.
[00:41:33.191 --> 00:41:34.572]  And we're not happy for them.
[00:41:34.672 --> 00:41:38.576]  I mean, let's face it, you do your time, you're supposed to be rotated back.
[00:41:39.517 --> 00:41:45.102]  The way I look at it is, let's drag out, you know, some of their family members and stuff and
[00:41:45.754 --> 00:41:46.755]  Send them to boot camp.
[00:41:47.235 --> 00:41:48.496]  Yeah, no, listen, I agree.
[00:41:48.556 --> 00:41:49.837]  Let's send the Bush daughters.
[00:41:49.977 --> 00:41:51.157]  Let's send Cheney's daughter.
[00:41:51.197 --> 00:41:52.278]  Let's send all these guys.
[00:41:52.798 --> 00:41:55.660]  Yeah, we've got some great female combat pilots out there.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:58.362]  And, you know, their daddy was a combat pilot.
[00:41:58.762 --> 00:41:59.703]  That was their grandpa.
[00:41:59.723 --> 00:42:00.743]  They might make a good one.
[00:42:00.763 --> 00:42:01.264]  You never know.
[00:42:01.284 --> 00:42:02.664]  Hey, good talking to you.
[00:42:02.785 --> 00:42:03.865]  I wouldn't be opposed to it.
[00:42:04.165 --> 00:42:05.967]  Keep up the good work, man, and we love you.
[00:42:06.207 --> 00:42:07.207]  Well, thanks a lot, Bill.
[00:42:07.968 --> 00:42:08.968]  What an interesting call.
[00:42:09.048 --> 00:42:11.110]  Got in trouble in Article 15.
[00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:14.512]  Got caught in, I guess, the barracks.
[00:42:15.172 --> 00:42:19.354]  Listening to us in the Middle East on wonderful shortwave.
[00:42:20.935 --> 00:42:32.841]  And that's why I expend, personally, myself, a lot of money to pay as a service to put the shortwave out.
[00:42:32.921 --> 00:42:43.386]  Because I get letters from Indonesia, Africa, Macedonia, emails from Russia and England, Scotland, Mexico, Chile,
[00:42:44.364 --> 00:42:46.105]  Folks listening to us on Global Fortwave.
[00:42:46.125 --> 00:42:51.128]  A lot of people out in their tanks listening right now.
[00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:52.148]  I want to say hi to them.
[00:42:52.168 --> 00:42:55.670]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas.
[00:42:55.690 --> 00:42:56.751]  I'm going to move quick here now.
[00:42:56.831 --> 00:42:57.551]  John, go ahead.
[00:42:57.571 --> 00:42:58.492]  Hi, Alex.
[00:42:58.512 --> 00:42:59.372]  How are you doing?
[00:43:00.193 --> 00:43:02.614]  That sort of leads into my question I was going to ask you.
[00:43:02.694 --> 00:43:05.736]  What kind of military strength do we have internally in this country anymore?
[00:43:07.685 --> 00:43:13.809]  Well, they do these questionnaires and on average 70 plus percent say they won't fire on Americans.
[00:43:14.450 --> 00:43:23.496]  The 24 percent that say yes, they get put into covert operations domestically.
[00:43:24.356 --> 00:43:30.801]  There's large contingents, I would say conservatively, over 100,000 military secret police
[00:43:31.829 --> 00:43:32.069]  Yeah.
[00:43:32.089 --> 00:43:32.369]  And, uh...
[00:44:01.044 --> 00:44:03.246]  Well, but still, she said the borders are wide open.
[00:44:03.266 --> 00:44:04.347]  They are.
[00:44:04.587 --> 00:44:04.948]  They are.
[00:44:05.128 --> 00:44:07.610]  My buddy lives right on the Canadian border.
[00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:10.473]  The border patrol station is about 100 yards from his house.
[00:44:11.033 --> 00:44:12.735]  We talked to the agent on a regular basis.
[00:44:12.775 --> 00:44:16.238]  He said Chinese are pouring across from Canada into the United States.
[00:44:16.678 --> 00:44:21.663]  There was a Houston Chronicle article about six months ago, no, it was about four months ago.
[00:44:23.264 --> 00:44:24.325]  Front page, 400,000 felons...
[00:44:28.268 --> 00:44:32.649]  Released in Texas alone in the year before, just because there's nowhere to hold them.
[00:44:33.049 --> 00:44:34.550]  And they're all illegal aliens.
[00:44:35.210 --> 00:44:39.931]  There's 400,000 illegal alien felons, and it said thousands were Chinese and Arab.
[00:44:42.012 --> 00:44:45.092]  They told him that on Harsens Island, which is in the middle of the St.
[00:44:45.132 --> 00:44:55.355]  Clair River, which is the border between the United States and Canada and Michigan, that they caught a bunch of Chinese with $3 million, and they all had automatic weapons, but he never heard anything about it on the news.
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:45:04.526]  Well, I've talked to Border Patrol, and it's even been in local news, where they catch an 18-wheeler full of coke, feds show up and say it's ours.
[00:45:04.546 --> 00:45:05.587]  It's part of an operation.
[00:45:05.907 --> 00:45:08.349]  They just take the three tons of cocaine.
[00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:16.776]  But, I mean, they stripped our National Guard out of here, which is supposed to be our internal, in case something happens, they're supposed to be there to protect us.
[00:45:16.796 --> 00:45:18.837]  But now we have Marcus Wolfe, sir.
[00:45:19.878 --> 00:45:20.118]  Yeah.
[00:45:20.999 --> 00:45:23.381]  Now we have the Silver Fox, the former head of the Stasi.
[00:45:24.247 --> 00:45:26.749]  General Primakov, KGB, they'll help.
[00:45:26.989 --> 00:45:28.810]  That's the wrong type of security, internal security.
[00:45:28.830 --> 00:45:30.111]  Well, now, sir, they're helping.
[00:45:30.131 --> 00:45:30.812]  They're our friends now.
[00:45:31.132 --> 00:45:31.392]  I know.
[00:45:31.952 --> 00:45:37.916]  But what I'm just trying to say is that... Are you unpatriotic to don't talk about the former Stasi chief helping?
[00:45:39.918 --> 00:45:40.818]  No, not really, Alex.
[00:45:40.958 --> 00:45:46.442]  Like I said, I don't need the Stasi, I don't need the KGB, I don't need the ex-Nazis, I don't need the... Well, I think you're pretty radical then.
[00:45:46.482 --> 00:45:48.563]  How dare you not want the former KGB here?
[00:45:48.844 --> 00:45:50.665]  Sir, the KGB's good.
[00:45:52.228 --> 00:46:00.214]  What my point is, is that, like I said, there's also, I visited a website that people swear that the Chinese have amassed a military force itself to the border.
[00:46:00.535 --> 00:46:02.336]  Now... Well, no swearing is needed.
[00:46:02.396 --> 00:46:06.599]  I've interviewed the head of the Border Patrol Union.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.821]  I've interviewed Border Patrol officers.
[00:46:08.881 --> 00:46:13.405]  I mean, the head of the Border Patrol Union said it's a world government new order takeover of America.
[00:46:13.765 --> 00:46:19.810]  There's Chinese, Arabs, everything else you can imagine, but the thousands in one county alone in Arizona every week.
[00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:21.071]  Ha ha ha!
[00:46:22.020 --> 00:46:23.421]  I mean, they arrest them all the time.
[00:46:24.321 --> 00:46:29.163]  And yes, there have been Asian troops photographed along the border.
[00:46:29.644 --> 00:46:33.545]  But again, sir, so what if our government gave the Communist Chinese Panama Canal?
[00:46:33.866 --> 00:46:36.447]  So what if they're giving weapons to the Mexican government?
[00:46:36.467 --> 00:46:37.767]  So what if they're down there training?
[00:46:37.987 --> 00:46:38.728]  They're good.
[00:46:38.948 --> 00:46:40.148]  The KGB's good.
[00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:41.369]  The Stasi are good.
[00:46:41.569 --> 00:46:43.170]  The People's Liberation Army's good.
[00:46:44.048 --> 00:46:48.249]  What's bad is homeschoolers and Christians and conservatives and gun owners.
[00:46:48.409 --> 00:46:48.769]  That's right.
[00:46:48.809 --> 00:46:52.350]  They were just hammering on a .50 caliber rifle on 60 Minutes yesterday.
[00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:53.750]  Well, Arnold's conservative.
[00:46:53.770 --> 00:46:54.430]  He banned it.
[00:46:54.650 --> 00:46:57.070]  I know he banned it, and they're drumming the drumbeat now.
[00:46:57.090 --> 00:46:58.971]  Well, that's why he's conservative, sir.
[00:47:00.311 --> 00:47:02.111]  You've got to get your head screwed on straight.
[00:47:02.131 --> 00:47:02.712]  Thanks for the call.
[00:47:03.672 --> 00:47:05.012]  No, it's horrible.
[00:47:07.392 --> 00:47:10.293]  It's just absolutely, totally horrible what's happening.
[00:47:13.869 --> 00:47:17.830]  And people think Bush is this wonderful conservative.
[00:47:17.850 --> 00:47:19.911]  They're totally in the dark, and that's why we're in trouble.
[00:47:20.951 --> 00:47:24.173]  Let's talk to Jason in Arizona, then Sherry, Adam, and others.
[00:47:24.213 --> 00:47:25.193]  Go ahead, Jason.
[00:47:25.553 --> 00:47:27.554]  Hey, I've got a quick little story for you and a question.
[00:47:27.574 --> 00:47:43.059]  I was engaged in a conversation with this proclaimed Christian woman, and I was telling her about your documentary, Dark Seekers, Bohemian Grove, and telling her about the rituals that Bush and certain world leaders are engaged in,
[00:47:43.689 --> 00:47:45.410]  And she says, well, that's not true.
[00:47:46.531 --> 00:47:48.752]  He says he prays in his White House staff every day.
[00:47:48.792 --> 00:47:52.454]  And I said, well, he tells you that, but this is the real deal.
[00:47:52.494 --> 00:48:03.060]  And I gave her a link to your website for Bohemian Grove, and she wouldn't look at it, would not look at it.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:09.124]  But my question to you was, when you were down there... Let me ask you a question.
[00:48:09.184 --> 00:48:11.305]  What was her excuse to not look at it?
[00:48:12.408 --> 00:48:14.270]  That it was just a bunch of lies.
[00:48:14.330 --> 00:48:19.394]  And I said, so you're the kind of person, don't bother me with the facts, my mind is already made up.
[00:48:19.595 --> 00:48:20.976]  And she didn't have anything to say to that.
[00:48:20.996 --> 00:48:22.037]  And I said, take a look at it.
[00:48:22.477 --> 00:48:23.558]  I said, you're being lied to.
[00:48:23.578 --> 00:48:26.641]  I said, don't you want to be the truthful?
[00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:27.882]  You know, I said, this...
[00:48:28.669 --> 00:48:32.830]  Documentary filmmaker Alex Jones infiltrated Bohemian Grove and got this on tape.
[00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:34.090]  I said, what more do you need?
[00:48:34.611 --> 00:48:45.573]  And my question to you was, when you were down... Well, I mean, she can type in George Bush, Bohemian Grove, and get AP, Reuters, Sacramento, B, San Francisco Chronicle, the Press Democrat, Washington Times.
[00:48:46.013 --> 00:48:47.434]  I mean, she goes to the website.
[00:48:47.454 --> 00:48:52.675]  We've got a link to National Geographic with them doing a mock human sacrifice in black hoods.
[00:48:53.055 --> 00:48:56.476]  Yeah, I gave her tons of examples such as that, but she just wouldn't hear of it.
[00:48:56.476 --> 00:48:59.117]  Because it's all lies, I'm sure.
[00:48:59.257 --> 00:48:59.457]  Right.
[00:48:59.837 --> 00:49:03.398]  So my question is, when you were down there filming, did you see anybody of importance?
[00:49:03.418 --> 00:49:06.999]  Because I know that you used a hidden camera and whatnot, so it was kind of hard to see.
[00:49:07.339 --> 00:49:08.219]  Well, here's the deal.
[00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:09.160]  Here's the deal.
[00:49:10.680 --> 00:49:20.783]  It is a private meeting, but because it's public officials there, I believe that it shouldn't be private because they're there making policy.
[00:49:20.863 --> 00:49:23.224]  But George Bush knows me.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:27.763]  My sister went to the same school as his daughters.
[00:49:27.803 --> 00:49:29.004]  My sister's a lot younger than me.
[00:49:32.127 --> 00:49:37.132]  George Bush, years after that, had me arrested for asking him a question.
[00:49:37.232 --> 00:49:39.395]  It was in the local paper.
[00:49:39.435 --> 00:49:43.158]  He then turned to one of the senators and said, That's Alex Jones.
[00:49:43.178 --> 00:49:44.660]  That's the guy who was heard whispering.
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:45.841]  That was in the newspaper.
[00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:48.745]  I didn't even see that.
[00:49:48.805 --> 00:49:50.907]  I was being drug out, but that's what they said the governor did.
[00:49:51.227 --> 00:49:52.268]  So Bush knows me.
[00:49:52.629 --> 00:50:03.798]  Now, Bush was there, and his father was there, and CNN reported the decision to pick Dick Cheney a few weeks later had been made there at the, quote, men's retreat Bohemian Grove.
[00:50:04.399 --> 00:50:08.222]  People have seen that clip of you being arrested just for asking that question.
[00:50:08.382 --> 00:50:11.064]  Yes, yes, but I was just using the example that Bush knows me.
[00:50:11.445 --> 00:50:12.826]  A lot of those people know me.
[00:50:13.346 --> 00:50:22.872]  And so I got in, I hid in the woods until nighttime, and then came down out of the hills to videotape the ritual, and then I got out of there.
[00:50:22.892 --> 00:50:31.537]  So it's kind of like I snuck into the castle, hid in a broom closet, snuck out at night, got the ritual on tape, and snuck out of the castle.
[00:50:31.617 --> 00:50:33.978]  I wasn't like going around going, hey, what?
[00:50:34.298 --> 00:50:34.679]  Exactly.
[00:50:34.699 --> 00:50:37.400]  Well, they couldn't believe that you got arrested just for asking a simple question.
[00:50:37.940 --> 00:50:40.502]  And that has turned so many people on.
[00:50:40.562 --> 00:50:42.203]  Just that short clip alone...
[00:50:42.717 --> 00:50:49.101]  ...has turned so many people towards listening to your program and getting your documentaries and waking up.
[00:50:49.121 --> 00:50:55.466]  Well, listen, it'd be like Tom Cruise in Eyes Wide Shut running in with a camera and taking his hood off and going kind of videotaping it.
[00:50:55.506 --> 00:50:56.366]  I just couldn't do it.
[00:50:56.767 --> 00:50:57.287]  Great points.
[00:50:57.327 --> 00:50:57.867]  Thanks for the call.
[00:50:57.887 --> 00:50:58.688]  We'll be back with more calls.
[00:51:01.957 --> 00:51:09.345]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:09.606 --> 00:51:14.331]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.571 --> 00:51:20.218]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.438 --> 00:51:24.981]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.201 --> 00:51:32.366]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.386 --> 00:51:36.869]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.089 --> 00:51:39.590]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masses of terror.
[00:51:39.811 --> 00:51:44.974]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroy
[00:51:45.074 --> 00:51:45.254]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:52:01.101 --> 00:52:01.721]  We're good to go.
[00:52:24.711 --> 00:52:34.600]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:43.529]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[00:52:43.709 --> 00:52:44.090]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:07.902]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.142 --> 00:53:10.403]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:53:50.048 --> 00:53:56.009]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective, natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:04.551 --> 00:54:08.312]  Again, the example, the analogy is eyes wide shut.
[00:54:10.193 --> 00:54:15.614]  Stanley Kubrick's final film, released posthumously, died before it was released.
[00:54:16.457 --> 00:54:19.798]  And you've got the elite engaged in devil worship or whatever.
[00:54:20.819 --> 00:54:22.760]  And he sneaks into the mansion while they're doing it.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.220]  Gets into it.
[00:54:25.101 --> 00:54:28.342]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that really goes on.
[00:54:30.103 --> 00:54:32.684]  And I was just in Bohemian Grove for about five hours.
[00:54:33.284 --> 00:54:42.548]  So I didn't run up to them and say, You see me riding in on the little shuttle from the checkpoint.
[00:54:43.413 --> 00:54:51.355]  With two members, and they bring up their robes, ceremonial robes, and that is in the film.
[00:54:51.795 --> 00:54:53.136]  You do see some faces of people.
[00:54:53.436 --> 00:55:00.878]  I probably shot three hours of film while I was in there, but I had to get to secure places and reload the camera, and that was hard to do.
[00:55:04.039 --> 00:55:09.280]  But again, I didn't just run up to people and go, man, I'm going to interview you now.
[00:55:10.987 --> 00:55:13.489]  There were surveillance cameras all in the trees everywhere.
[00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:16.771]  Secret service and security people marching around.
[00:55:16.811 --> 00:55:21.875]  I mean, they were shopping people's cars outside of it, you know, ten miles away, searching people's cars.
[00:55:21.935 --> 00:55:26.398]  I have interviews of that in the film with locals who were basically harassed by the security people.
[00:55:27.939 --> 00:55:28.520]  It's amazing.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:33.624]  By the way, if you want to see Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove, you can see it instantly.
[00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:38.287]  If you're a member of PrisonPlanet.tv, you can watch it in high bandwidth and low bandwidth.
[00:55:38.945 --> 00:55:47.450]  The entire film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, is on prisonplanet.tv, as well as ten other films I've made.
[00:55:47.470 --> 00:55:50.992]  A whole bunch of other videos I've been authorized by the authors to post.
[00:55:54.454 --> 00:56:01.538]  Muhammad Atta and His Flying Circus by Mr. Hopsinger, a great film about 9-11.
[00:56:01.938 --> 00:56:03.399]  He authorized us to post that.
[00:56:03.439 --> 00:56:04.939]  That's going to be going up in the next few days.
[00:56:05.860 --> 00:56:07.681]  My weekly report's up there, a new one.
[00:56:08.669 --> 00:56:11.776]  Just a lot of key stuff is on prisonplanet.tv.
[00:56:14.292 --> 00:56:16.033]  A Dean Haglin interview is going up.
[00:56:16.253 --> 00:56:21.854]  I'm going to put 9-11 emergency release, a film I just offered for a few months that I made very quickly, and then I made Road to Tyranny.
[00:56:22.334 --> 00:56:24.575]  That film, though, needs to still be seen.
[00:56:24.655 --> 00:56:29.836]  I don't sell it anymore, hard copies of it, but we're going to put that the next few days on prisonplanet.tv.
[00:56:30.157 --> 00:56:31.917]  There's so much new media all the time.
[00:56:32.277 --> 00:56:42.300]  If you're not online and you want copies of Road to Tyranny or Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove or my newest film, American Dictators, where we revisit Bohemian Grove, by the way, among many other things,
[00:56:43.312 --> 00:56:44.793]  I'm still offering that special.
[00:56:44.833 --> 00:56:45.974]  Still haven't taken them down.
[00:56:45.994 --> 00:56:50.977]  You buy one copy of Road to Tyranny, almost three hours long, for $24.95.
[00:56:51.397 --> 00:56:53.679]  Each additional copy, as many as you want, is $5.95.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:56.200]  American Dictators, $19.95.
[00:56:58.061 --> 00:56:59.242]  Almost a two-hour film.
[00:57:00.063 --> 00:57:02.684]  My newest film, buy one copy for $19.95.
[00:57:03.084 --> 00:57:04.005]  Each additional copy, $5.95.
[00:57:04.465 --> 00:57:07.227]  And folks, it is coming down very soon.
[00:57:07.267 --> 00:57:08.868]  I've just been so busy, I haven't taken it down yet.
[00:57:09.577 --> 00:57:11.179]  Those specials are still being offered.
[00:57:11.379 --> 00:57:15.302]  Go to Infowars.com to peruse the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[00:57:15.703 --> 00:57:16.844]  Order the films online.

[00:57:19.626 --> 00:57:25.832]  Bunch of different specials.
[00:57:25.852 --> 00:57:26.833]  Just call and ask about them.
[00:57:26.853 --> 00:57:27.813]  No obligation to buy.

[00:57:33.658 --> 00:57:41.881]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:57:43.581 --> 00:57:44.822]  Please don't procrastinate.
[00:57:44.922 --> 00:57:45.642]  All right, I promise.
[00:57:46.442 --> 00:57:49.583]  When we start the next hour, I'll go straight to Sherry, Adam, Steve, and others.
[00:57:50.603 --> 00:57:55.765]  I got into the government paying off the media, this latest Armstrong-Williams situation.
[00:57:56.485 --> 00:57:59.166]  Then I want to get into a bunch of other stuff I have not covered yet.
[00:57:59.206 --> 00:58:01.927]  I believe the stack is prolific today.
[00:58:03.516 --> 00:58:04.437]  There is so much.
[00:58:04.997 --> 00:58:07.920]  Top CIA man says, eh, let Bin Laden go.
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:08.761]  Don't worry about him.
[00:58:09.362 --> 00:58:10.403]  That's World Net Daily.
[00:58:12.324 --> 00:58:15.968]  Guilty plea in fatal Masons initiation shooting.
[00:58:16.809 --> 00:58:18.330]  That's coming up from Newsday.
[00:58:18.350 --> 00:58:19.491]  Remember that ceremony?
[00:58:20.012 --> 00:58:21.013]  Blowing the head off.
[00:58:21.833 --> 00:58:24.936]  Bush the King blows $50 million on Coronation.
[00:58:24.956 --> 00:58:26.538]  More on the U.N.
[00:58:26.638 --> 00:58:27.379]  sex scandal.
[00:58:29.838 --> 00:58:36.240]  Four Pentagon press releases of detainees at age 30 having heart attacks, and quite a few do.
[00:58:36.260 --> 00:58:48.345]  Of course, when the corpses are photographed, they have their toenails and fingernails ripped out and electricity marks all over their body, but again, it's all natural causes, and we'll be right back.
[00:58:51.366 --> 00:58:58.068]  Introduce... Big Brother.
[00:58:58.769 --> 00:58:59.850]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.550 --> 00:59:01.651]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.292 --> 00:59:03.152]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:04.773]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.454 --> 00:59:09.077]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.637 --> 00:59:13.780]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:21.706 --> 00:59:23.187]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:24.295 --> 00:59:29.397]  Hour number two in our worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:59:30.657 --> 00:59:37.600]  Joining you from the front lines of the InfoWar, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:45.742]  The websites are prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com, infowars.net, and a bunch of other great ones.
[00:59:46.362 --> 00:59:46.703]  Okay.
[00:59:48.263 --> 00:59:48.543]  Listen.
[00:59:49.624 --> 00:59:53.025]  I only covered a couple articles last hour, and I'm literally looking at about 95 others
[00:59:54.781 --> 00:59:55.742]  But I need to get to.
[00:59:56.122 --> 00:59:58.404]  So I'm going to rapid machine gun fire through them.
[00:59:58.924 --> 01:00:04.469]  After we get through the next three callers who've been holding the longest, Sherry, Adam, Steve, then we'll go to Larry and others after that.
[01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:06.911]  Sherry in Oregon, thank you for holding.
[01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:07.251]  Welcome.
[01:00:07.811 --> 01:00:08.352]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:09.112 --> 01:00:17.559]  I just read an article off of JeffRentz.com that Senator Bill Frist plans to file a bill that would define political paranoia as a mental disorder.
[01:00:18.536 --> 01:00:19.537]  Yes, I did see that.
[01:00:19.597 --> 01:00:20.698]  Why don't you tell folks about it?
[01:00:21.078 --> 01:00:27.244]  They've introduced hundreds in the last five years of new medical terms.
[01:00:27.504 --> 01:00:31.808]  If you don't like being searched, it's a mental illness.
[01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:37.913]  If you don't like giving up your bodily fluids to the government, it's a mental illness.
[01:00:38.033 --> 01:00:39.314]  Everything is a mental illness.
[01:00:40.055 --> 01:00:42.878]  Well, I want to make a plea to the American people.
[01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:45.540]  I already called Fritz's office this morning.
[01:00:46.269 --> 01:00:52.531]  And basically, Alex, I'm a registered nurse, and from my observation, this man is a sociopath.
[01:00:52.651 --> 01:00:53.471]  He is delusional.
[01:00:53.511 --> 01:00:55.292]  He is paranoid, and he is psychotic.
[01:00:55.792 --> 01:01:02.214]  Well, no, I would just say that the elite, I mean, the Soviets grabbed millions saying they were mentally ill and sent them to work camps.
[01:01:02.254 --> 01:01:03.554]  The Nazis did this.
[01:01:04.214 --> 01:01:07.675]  I mean, our government's been grabbing people for 100 years saying they're crazy.
[01:01:08.695 --> 01:01:12.697]  They locked up Galileo for saying the world was round.
[01:01:12.717 --> 01:01:12.757]  So...
[01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:17.052]  Was it Galileo or was it the other guy?
[01:01:17.072 --> 01:01:19.936]  The point is that this is nothing new.
[01:01:21.458 --> 01:01:26.064]  5,000 years ago, the witch doctor, if you disagreed with him, would say you were loco and possessed by demons.
[01:01:26.404 --> 01:01:27.746]  So basically, this is the new thing.
[01:01:27.966 --> 01:01:29.548]  They don't call you a witch anymore.
[01:01:30.087 --> 01:01:34.009]  You know, when they're the witches, that's actually what the witch hunts were.
[01:01:34.049 --> 01:01:38.091]  They were devil worshippers disguising their Satanism in a witch hunt.
[01:01:38.151 --> 01:01:40.892]  Again, that's how everything's actually a complex inverse of itself.
[01:01:40.952 --> 01:01:47.035]  But no, I mean, tell folks who just joined us about this latest abomination.
[01:01:48.475 --> 01:01:48.755]  Pardon?
[01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:50.676]  Tell us about the news article.
[01:01:51.136 --> 01:01:52.497]  I'll just read it briefly to you.
[01:01:52.557 --> 01:01:56.939]  It says, "...when the 109th Congress convenes in Washington in January..."
[01:01:57.358 --> 01:02:09.601]  Senator Bill Frist, the first practicing physician elected to the Senate since 1928, plans to file a bill that would define political paranoia as a mental disorder, paving the way for individuals who suffer paranoid delusions regarding voter fraud.
[01:02:10.081 --> 01:02:16.063]  Political persecution and FBI surveillance to receive Medicare reimbursement for any psychiatric treatment they receive.
[01:02:17.323 --> 01:02:19.504]  This is written by Hermione Slotkin.
[01:02:20.043 --> 01:02:24.328]  Medical correspondent for the Swift Report, Rick Smith, spokesman for Senator Frist.
[01:02:24.348 --> 01:02:25.208]  I saw the article.
[01:02:25.429 --> 01:02:26.310]  It's crazy.
[01:02:26.450 --> 01:02:29.133]  Look, they're going to forcibly, psychologically test all the children.
[01:02:29.173 --> 01:02:29.553]  Go ahead.
[01:02:29.993 --> 01:02:30.374]  Exactly.
[01:02:30.694 --> 01:02:36.220]  Well, Alex, I'm going to investigate filing a court case against Senator Frist.
[01:02:37.664 --> 01:02:39.725]  That's because you're ill, my dear.
[01:02:40.025 --> 01:02:40.545]  Yes, I know.
[01:02:40.585 --> 01:02:41.006]  I'm very ill.
[01:02:41.026 --> 01:02:41.326]  No, no.
[01:02:41.346 --> 01:02:42.767]  Soon it's going to be all right.
[01:02:42.967 --> 01:02:47.530]  Well, I'm encouraging other Americans to step up to this and fight back.
[01:02:47.570 --> 01:02:54.894]  But once you're in a facility for a few years, after the electro shot and the drugs, it's not going to hurt anymore, Sherry.
[01:02:55.975 --> 01:02:58.637]  Sherry, you're going to join and you're going to love Big Brother.
[01:02:58.857 --> 01:02:59.497]  No, I'm not, Alex.
[01:02:59.517 --> 01:03:01.138]  You're going to go to the Chestnut Cafe.
[01:03:01.238 --> 01:03:02.279]  I'm going to die fighting.
[01:03:02.439 --> 01:03:04.360]  You're going to drink your gin at the Chestnut Cafe?
[01:03:04.681 --> 01:03:05.001]  Oh, no.
[01:03:05.021 --> 01:03:05.061]  No.
[01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:07.442]  I sold you and you sold me?
[01:03:07.462 --> 01:03:09.543]  This is horrible, Alex.
[01:03:09.643 --> 01:03:12.505]  I'm just... I was so angry when I read this.
[01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:15.606]  Don't you... You know what the Chestnut Cafe is, don't you?
[01:03:15.666 --> 01:03:16.167]  No, I don't.
[01:03:16.187 --> 01:03:16.167]  1984.
[01:03:16.907 --> 01:03:18.008]  Oh, yes.
[01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:19.248]  Okay, yes, I have seen that.
[01:03:19.288 --> 01:03:19.749]  I'm sorry.
[01:03:19.769 --> 01:03:27.553]  Yeah, I just wanted to comment on that, and I just hope other Americans will stand up and fight against this.
[01:03:27.613 --> 01:03:29.233]  We need to do something about this bill.
[01:03:30.074 --> 01:03:32.055]  No, fabulous, fabulous idea.
[01:03:32.075 --> 01:03:33.876]  Do you want to hold over and make more comments on it?
[01:03:34.831 --> 01:03:35.332]  No, that's okay.
[01:03:35.372 --> 01:03:38.033]  I think if you want to comment on... Okay.
[01:03:38.313 --> 01:03:38.934]  Okay, thank you.
[01:03:38.954 --> 01:03:42.916]  I just kind of was jumping in and I felt bad for that because you're a very eloquent, wonderful person.
[01:03:43.457 --> 01:03:44.097]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:44.137 --> 01:03:44.778]  Please call back.
[01:03:44.798 --> 01:03:45.378]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:52.935 --> 01:03:57.281]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.441 --> 01:04:01.886]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.026 --> 01:04:06.372]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.432 --> 01:04:07.793]  The New World Order.
[01:04:08.514 --> 01:04:09.535]  Pan Amers.
[01:04:09.575 --> 01:04:13.798]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:13.858 --> 01:04:20.804]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:22.965]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.305 --> 01:04:33.673]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:56.102]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:56.442 --> 01:05:05.272]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:05.592 --> 01:05:10.258]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:10.718 --> 01:05:17.443]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:17.844 --> 01:05:29.633]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:30.113 --> 01:05:34.578]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:34.738 --> 01:05:37.200]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:39.042]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:05:43.646 --> 01:05:44.807]  Next Wednesday night.
[01:05:56.943 --> 01:05:59.684]  What America needs is affordable health insurance.
[01:06:00.565 --> 01:06:05.387]  Finding affordable health insurance for you and your family, it's on everybody's mind right now.
[01:06:05.427 --> 01:06:08.388]  And if you're self-employed, it's on your mind too.
[01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:13.530]  Well, I found a company you can call right now and get the affordable health insurance coverage you're looking for.
[01:06:13.670 --> 01:06:16.731]  The Midwest National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee.
[01:06:16.992 --> 01:06:17.932]  Write this number down.
[01:06:19.194 --> 01:06:19.754]  800-807-5989.
[01:06:20.175 --> 01:06:24.601]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:06:25.001 --> 01:06:36.276]  They specialize in helping entrepreneurs of all kinds and those of us who run small businesses or don't get health insurance where we work to protect our families with the health insurance we need.
[01:06:36.796 --> 01:06:40.839]  And if you have a COBRA plan that's about to expire, we can help you too.
[01:06:40.939 --> 01:06:42.361]  So call us right now.
[01:06:42.381 --> 01:06:42.641]  800-807-5989.
[01:06:42.701 --> 01:06:42.941]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:43.922]  Not available in all states.
[01:06:43.942 --> 01:06:45.243]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:45.263 --> 01:06:46.584]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:06.423]  Alright, masses of key news, vital information coming up here momentarily.
[01:07:08.384 --> 01:07:10.165]  Adam in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
[01:07:10.185 --> 01:07:10.365]  Welcome.
[01:07:10.385 --> 01:07:12.367]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:07:12.627 --> 01:07:13.007]  Good, sir.
[01:07:13.507 --> 01:07:21.773]  Hey, I found some good material for you over the weekend I'd like to send to you for your new video or anything else that you're going to be getting into.
[01:07:21.933 --> 01:07:22.373]  What is it?
[01:07:23.093 --> 01:07:28.677]  Well, speaking of mental disorders, let's go back to the, I believe it was the second Bush debate.
[01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:39.577]  Where he was, where there was questions about whether he was wearing an earpiece during the debate and where he, you know, cut no one off in the middle of his rant and, you know, said, will you let me finish this?
[01:07:40.498 --> 01:07:44.000]  While he was in the middle of the, giving an answer when nobody had interrupted him.
[01:07:45.941 --> 01:07:46.161]  Hello?
[01:07:46.201 --> 01:07:46.321]  Yes.
[01:07:46.581 --> 01:07:46.821]  Okay.
[01:07:47.161 --> 01:07:57.747]  And last weekend on the National Geographic channel I saw a show about the Secret Service and there was about a minute or so where they're all in this room and they're putting on their shirts
[01:07:58.445 --> 01:08:04.387]  And they all had the transceiver boxes on the back of their vests, where it was plainly visible.
[01:08:04.687 --> 01:08:07.868]  And then when they put on their jackets in this clip, it shows it really well.
[01:08:08.348 --> 01:08:14.149]  You can see the bulge sticking up off the top of the suit jacket, just like Bush's was during the debate.
[01:08:14.369 --> 01:08:19.891]  No, they have little ear pieces that go inside the ear canal.
[01:08:19.971 --> 01:08:21.371]  And I have no doubt... Look, look.
[01:08:22.212 --> 01:08:25.893]  I mean, he... In fact, we have these clips on the computer up at the network.
[01:08:25.913 --> 01:08:26.853]  Perhaps they can find them.
[01:08:27.501 --> 01:08:29.823]  But it's where Bush is going, wait a minute, hold on.
[01:08:31.685 --> 01:08:32.966]  The reporter asks him a question.
[01:08:33.006 --> 01:08:35.709]  He goes, you know you're supposed to give me these before written.
[01:08:35.749 --> 01:08:36.510]  This is scripted.
[01:08:36.830 --> 01:08:37.731]  He goes, hold on a minute.
[01:08:37.811 --> 01:08:39.293]  I'm waiting for something to pop in my head.
[01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:41.495]  And he just sits there going, uh-huh.
[01:08:41.895 --> 01:08:43.236]  To himself going, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[01:08:43.737 --> 01:08:45.439]  All right, well, it's just popping in my head.
[01:08:45.459 --> 01:08:46.199]  It's supposed to.
[01:08:46.219 --> 01:08:49.583]  I mean, there's no doubt.
[01:08:50.043 --> 01:08:51.865]  Either he's a complete lunatic.
[01:08:52.762 --> 01:08:56.208]  A complete mental patient or he's got an earpiece.
[01:08:56.249 --> 01:08:56.589]  Go ahead.
[01:08:56.870 --> 01:08:59.574]  Last night on the History Channel, they had another special.
[01:09:00.297 --> 01:09:11.541]  And it was about the new stealth technology that the soldiers are going to be using in the future, basically the future soldier with the super suit that can produce holographic illusions for camouflage.
[01:09:11.561 --> 01:09:13.342]  Well, yeah, they already have this.
[01:09:14.502 --> 01:09:16.823]  It's as thin as a newspaper, a little bit thicker.
[01:09:16.843 --> 01:09:28.967]  And what it is is you've got a camera on your back, and it projects the image on a TV screen on your front, and a camera on the front, and your actual uniform is a TV screen.
[01:09:29.727 --> 01:09:32.649]  For those that don't know what I'm talking about, it's like Arnold Schwarzenegger's The Predator.
[01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:35.451]  They already have armored vehicles that are like that.
[01:09:36.172 --> 01:09:39.034]  And they're secret, but they've gone public with it.
[01:09:39.074 --> 01:09:42.436]  Jane's Weapon Encyclopedia has done some reports on it.
[01:09:42.817 --> 01:09:44.718]  Go ahead and finish what you were saying.
[01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:58.088]  The new helmets that the soldiers are going to be wearing have the bone conduction built into the helmet where it will just resonate the soldier's skull, and that's how they'll be able to hear their commands instead of wearing an earpiece on the helmet.
[01:09:58.108 --> 01:09:59.169]  And I actually have the
[01:09:59.673 --> 01:10:02.654]  It's tape-cued up to that point if you want to hear the clip.
[01:10:02.794 --> 01:10:03.795]  Oh, sure.
[01:10:03.855 --> 01:10:05.455]  The patent on that's from 1954.
[01:10:05.515 --> 01:10:08.376]  We're going to be getting Dr. Begich on about that.
[01:10:09.537 --> 01:10:10.977]  How long is the clip?
[01:10:11.397 --> 01:10:11.978]  Maybe a minute.
[01:10:12.418 --> 01:10:15.699]  Okay, just make sure your phone's about eight inches from the speaker.
[01:10:15.819 --> 01:10:16.279]  Sure.
[01:10:16.659 --> 01:10:16.879]  Okay.
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:18.680]  Get it going here.
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:26.103]  For those who don't believe in this, they have Coke machines now in Japan that broadcast directly to your skull ads as you walk past them.
[01:10:26.543 --> 01:10:27.363]  Okay, here we go.
[01:10:27.844 --> 01:10:28.224]  Here we go.
[01:10:28.244 --> 01:10:28.924]  Okay.
[01:10:36.487 --> 01:10:45.135]  On the left hand side is a thermal imaging site, which allows the soldier to see in not only traditional infrared, but also thermal images.
[01:10:45.195 --> 01:10:47.738]  So the soldier can identify targets in a nighttime environment.
[01:10:48.462 --> 01:10:59.408]  On the right hand side is infrared target designator, target locator, which allows the soldier to identify, locate a target, and pinpoint that target to other soldiers so we can bring more massed fire to the individual target.
[01:11:00.389 --> 01:11:07.293]  The new fighter will eventually be able to view images from these sites on a tiny screen that will drop down over his eye.
[01:11:08.033 --> 01:11:14.377]  This small eyepiece will approximate a 17 inch color monitor displaying the conditions of battle around him.
[01:11:15.830 --> 01:11:19.253]  Each helmet also holds a small friend or foe sensor.
[01:11:19.393 --> 01:11:25.177]  When friendly soldiers or aircraft target this fighter, the sensor instantly signals, he's one of us.
[01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:26.318]  Hold your fire.
[01:11:27.439 --> 01:11:30.902]  You'll notice that in the helmet system, there's no earphones or microphones.
[01:11:30.962 --> 01:11:36.886]  We've actually moved into what's called bone conduction, which is a sensor that sits on the human skull and registers the vibration.
[01:11:38.854 --> 01:11:41.096]  So the head becomes a transceiver for sound.
[01:11:41.576 --> 01:11:44.179]  What's really nice is it allows the soldier to be quieter.
[01:11:44.199 --> 01:11:52.766]  So he doesn't have to worry about a radio going off and giving away his position in a battlefield environment.
[01:11:53.266 --> 01:11:53.666]  That's it.
[01:11:54.487 --> 01:11:55.268]  Very interesting.
[01:11:55.308 --> 01:11:55.948]  Send that to me.
[01:11:56.269 --> 01:11:56.769]  Yeah, okay.
[01:11:57.330 --> 01:12:01.793]  And looks like Bush doesn't have to worry about throwing up for a debate anymore either.
[01:12:03.665 --> 01:12:04.385]  What he's going to say.
[01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:05.346]  All right.
[01:12:05.486 --> 01:12:06.687]  Hey, listen, thanks for the call.
[01:12:06.867 --> 01:12:07.147]  All right.
[01:12:07.708 --> 01:12:22.159]  Now, this stuff is real, and you are totally invisible, speaking of the invisibility surge, but what it does is it's like a watery image.
[01:12:22.179 --> 01:12:23.600]  I don't really know how to describe it.
[01:12:23.621 --> 01:12:24.101]  It looks like...
[01:12:25.866 --> 01:12:29.728]  The descriptions of ghosts, you know, where it's like you really can't see it.
[01:12:29.748 --> 01:12:31.309]  It's like shimmering there in the air.
[01:12:31.869 --> 01:12:32.909]  That's what these things do.
[01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:49.276]  And it's actually an array of tiny cameras on the back, and it picks up an image of what's directly behind you and then transmits that to the uniform and the face mask that itself is a TV screen or a filament.
[01:12:49.917 --> 01:12:52.718]  And then, of course, you have cameras on the front, cameras on the side, and
[01:12:53.331 --> 01:13:01.173]  You know, the camera's on the front, put the image on the back, the camera's on the back, put the image on the front, and they've got these armored vehicles that do this.
[01:13:04.334 --> 01:13:19.459]  And I've seen television demonstrations of it, and it looks like that movie The Predator, where, you know, the evil space alien has come to hunt the humans and has the invisibility suit.
[01:13:21.118 --> 01:13:25.602]  But what that piece mentioned are these little transponders that are in the uniforms now.
[01:13:26.222 --> 01:13:42.336]  But the military's been saying, you know, this is a problem because the enemy can get our uniforms, and they show up as a friendly in this total battlefield system they have with satellite integration and the troops all looking at computer screens and their helmets.
[01:13:42.917 --> 01:13:45.659]  And so that's the argument for chipping the troops themselves.
[01:13:45.959 --> 01:13:47.661]  Then the enemy can't get the chips.
[01:13:49.571 --> 01:13:54.354]  So it's a major league jump into the New World Order.
[01:13:55.174 --> 01:14:00.497]  Well, they say, what, by 2010, half the Air Force is going to be drone?
[01:14:02.638 --> 01:14:08.822]  And projecting out from there, there'll be a day when almost every aircraft is remote controlled.
[01:14:10.082 --> 01:14:12.384]  And then it adds a whole other facet to this.
[01:14:12.824 --> 01:14:15.245]  The troops won't have to be up close to those they kill.
[01:14:15.285 --> 01:14:16.566]  It'll all be a video game.
[01:14:17.108 --> 01:14:25.974]  The computer screen actually will even take the video, quote, enhance it, so put it into kind of a cartoon look, and you'll just be killing the enemy that way.
[01:14:27.215 --> 01:14:35.160]  And they've got already battle droids, and they're not like the robots in Star Wars or something.
[01:14:36.981 --> 01:14:44.886]  One example was in one of the big papers about a year ago out of...
[01:14:46.969 --> 01:14:57.852]  Hawaii, and it showed this tank, this mini tank, or droid, that has multiple treads and retractable treads, and it looks like something out of a cartoon.
[01:14:57.892 --> 01:15:01.292]  I mean, it's got like ten guns on the front and back of it.
[01:15:01.312 --> 01:15:02.913]  It's just a blister of weapons.
[01:15:04.013 --> 01:15:07.074]  And it shows a SWAT team with a big...
[01:15:09.096 --> 01:15:13.585]  Armored shields, all firing machine guns at it.
[01:15:13.886 --> 01:15:15.549]  And it's not firing at them.
[01:15:16.250 --> 01:15:17.954]  They were just testing its armor.
[01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:22.704]  And these things are remote-controlled, so you'll have these rolling around.
[01:15:22.724 --> 01:15:31.408]  And back at a base, it could be in Africa, it could be in California, it could be in New York, it could be in Wiesbaden, Germany.
[01:15:31.748 --> 01:15:32.929]  It could be anywhere on the globe.
[01:15:32.989 --> 01:15:41.953]  Antarctica, controlled by satellite, but somebody's sitting in a simulator, and they're just driving around these little mini-tanks or these attack droids.
[01:15:43.325 --> 01:16:02.456]  And then the next wave of technology is just to take the human out of it completely where there's mass programs and these things are programmed where the robot face scans you and just goes around face scanning people or the biometrics of your walk or your run just killing people on contact.
[01:16:03.036 --> 01:16:04.357]  Just seeking and destroying.
[01:16:04.777 --> 01:16:10.881]  And they've got smaller ones that go into your house and kill you and it's pretty serious.
[01:16:10.901 --> 01:16:10.981]  Yeah.
[01:16:12.495 --> 01:16:15.076]  Yeah, it's 2005, boys and girls.
[01:16:15.796 --> 01:16:17.616]  Let's talk to Steve in Pennsylvania.
[01:16:17.656 --> 01:16:18.496]  Steve, you're on the air.
[01:16:18.556 --> 01:16:18.996]  Go ahead.
[01:16:19.016 --> 01:16:19.717]  Hello, Alex.
[01:16:20.097 --> 01:16:20.877]  Good to talk to you.
[01:16:22.357 --> 01:16:23.197]  Some information.
[01:16:23.517 --> 01:16:31.919]  The CB-67 USS John F. Kennedy was supposed to be decommissioned back in the mid-90s.
[01:16:31.979 --> 01:16:34.040]  I served my time in the early 90s on there.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.960]  Basically, it was more like a political party barge.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:40.281]  I was stuck down in four main machinery rooms.
[01:16:41.721 --> 01:16:53.348]  For those who just joined us, we had an active duty individual call in talking about, and just a side note, mentioned that particular non-nuclear aircraft carrier.
[01:16:53.608 --> 01:16:56.270]  Why do you call it a political party barge?
[01:16:57.451 --> 01:17:01.573]  More like more of an advertisement.
[01:17:02.494 --> 01:17:03.935]  They just poke people around.
[01:17:03.955 --> 01:17:09.979]  Normally from November to April, they do a six-month Mediterranean tour
[01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:15.062]  It's just basically just go around port to port to port visiting people.
[01:17:15.082 --> 01:17:18.803]  I mean, it's really nothing major, you know.
[01:17:19.824 --> 01:17:24.506]  Like New York City, yeah, Fleet Week, I think that's in June or July, I can't remember.
[01:17:25.546 --> 01:17:29.528]  That's the only aircraft carrier that they'll let up there.
[01:17:29.588 --> 01:17:33.249]  Any nukes, nuclear aircraft carriers, they will not let them up there.
[01:17:34.430 --> 01:17:35.410]  It's just...
[01:17:38.081 --> 01:17:41.923]  One weekend, you go up there and basically everybody just goes out and parties, you know?
[01:17:44.004 --> 01:17:45.625]  It's really kind of weird.
[01:17:46.045 --> 01:17:46.425]  Interesting.
[01:17:46.445 --> 01:17:47.526]  What else is on your mind?
[01:17:48.166 --> 01:18:02.554]  Yesterday on Meet the Press, I can't remember the lady's name, they were talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger, and she was basically saying, I don't know how true it is, that she pretty much guessed that he's about one amendment away from presidency.
[01:18:03.134 --> 01:18:04.615]  Well, was she pro-Arnold?
[01:18:05.315 --> 01:18:06.076]  That I don't know.
[01:18:07.185 --> 01:18:08.846]  Well, was it a blonde woman?
[01:18:09.067 --> 01:18:09.247]  Yeah.
[01:18:10.288 --> 01:18:12.430]  Oh, it wasn't Morgan Fowler Jones, was it?
[01:18:13.290 --> 01:18:15.332]  No, not that I'm aware of.
[01:18:15.472 --> 01:18:20.797]  Well, no, I mean, the Kennedy biographer is writing an authorized biography, and it's been in the newspaper.
[01:18:20.857 --> 01:18:26.421]  It's coming out this year, and it says that Arnold is going to be running for president.
[01:18:27.222 --> 01:18:30.305]  Quote, the secret plan to put him into the presidency.
[01:18:32.146 --> 01:18:32.647]  What can we do?
[01:18:35.057 --> 01:18:37.418]  Well, I mean, it just shows our humiliation as a country.
[01:18:37.478 --> 01:18:38.538]  By the way, we're working on that.
[01:18:38.598 --> 01:18:40.319]  We're going to get those ads out in California.
[01:18:40.359 --> 01:18:42.300]  Thanks for the support with ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:43.260]  That's coming up.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:45.841]  All right, Steve, thanks for the call.
[01:18:46.201 --> 01:18:50.043]  I'm going to come back and cover news, and then go back to your call.
[01:18:50.083 --> 01:18:50.503]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.899 --> 01:18:55.140]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin.
[01:19:13.732 --> 01:19:14.392]  We're good to go.

[01:19:54.631 --> 01:19:55.171]  Hi, folks.
[01:19:55.231 --> 01:19:56.952]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:19:57.292 --> 01:19:58.292]  The real money, folks.
[01:20:01.587 --> 01:20:03.508]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:04.869]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:20:04.909 --> 01:20:05.509]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:20:05.549 --> 01:20:05.949]  A 5% increase.
[01:20:05.989 --> 01:20:08.931]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:20:08.951 --> 01:20:11.192]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:20:11.252 --> 01:20:12.952]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[01:20:12.972 --> 01:20:13.873]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:20:29.228 --> 01:20:30.209]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:20:53.109 --> 01:20:56.490]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:20:56.730 --> 01:20:57.071]  Why?
[01:20:57.091 --> 01:21:00.032]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:21:00.112 --> 01:21:05.053]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:21:05.174 --> 01:21:14.877]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[01:21:53.701 --> 01:22:02.766]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:22:03.026 --> 01:22:14.252]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:22:14.592 --> 01:22:20.295]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:22:20.555 --> 01:22:21.036]  We're good to go.

[01:22:52.922 --> 01:23:01.705]  All right.
[01:23:01.745 --> 01:23:03.786]  More of your calls are coming up later at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:03.826 --> 01:23:08.128]  Right now, I'm going to plunge into news.
[01:23:09.729 --> 01:23:11.330]  This is from World Net Daily.
[01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:14.191]  Let Bin Laden stay free, says X...
[01:23:14.989 --> 01:23:20.672]  Number three, CIA man warns capturing most wanted terrorists could trigger new wave of attacks.
[01:23:22.312 --> 01:23:24.914]  Now again, they were saying they were going to capture him.
[01:23:24.934 --> 01:23:26.794]  I got this from a White House source.
[01:23:27.015 --> 01:23:28.555]  Never said it was going to be true or not.
[01:23:29.155 --> 01:23:32.377]  Said it could be disinfo right before the election.
[01:23:33.140 --> 01:23:36.062]  And the next best thing happened for the globalists.
[01:23:36.102 --> 01:23:39.645]  Even Karl Rove told New York papers, quote, a gift from Bin Laden.
[01:23:39.665 --> 01:23:42.767]  He came out and basically, you know, Bush is evil.
[01:23:42.807 --> 01:23:44.868]  Well, the reverse effect's going to happen.
[01:23:44.908 --> 01:23:45.949]  Bin Laden's not stupid.
[01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:49.932]  If you even believe that new videotape that showed up.
[01:23:51.133 --> 01:24:00.339]  But this new statement about let Bin Laden go, this coming from the guy who was directly implicated but never investigated for the abnormal market activity days before 9-11.
[01:24:02.170 --> 01:24:08.975]  Three years after the attack on New York World Trade Center, the manhunt for Osama Bin Laden has failed to produce the world's most wanted terrorist.
[01:24:10.516 --> 01:24:13.618]  And according to former number three man at the CIA, that's just fine.
[01:24:13.678 --> 01:24:16.300]  Former Central Intelligence Agency executive A.B.
[01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:22.585]  Buzzy Crongard has told the London Times that letting the Al-Qaeda leader run free may actually make the world a safer place.
[01:24:23.505 --> 01:24:25.727]  You can make the argument that we'd better off...
[01:24:26.326 --> 01:24:36.384]  With him at large, Cronkart said, because if something happens to Bin Laden, you might find a lot of people vying for his position and demonstrating how macho they are by unleashing a stream of terror.
[01:24:38.027 --> 01:24:39.388]  Krongard, former head of A.B.
[01:24:39.448 --> 01:24:45.614]  Brown & Co., Baltimore-based investment bank, came to the CIA in 1998 as the director of George Tenet's council.
[01:24:46.115 --> 01:24:51.019]  He was appointed executive director to the CIA in March 2001 by President Bush.
[01:24:51.039 --> 01:24:58.106]  Krongard, 68, stepped down six weeks ago as the agency's third most senior executive following the appointment of Porter Goss' director.
[01:25:00.528 --> 01:25:03.811]  And no mention of him in insider trading.
[01:25:04.986 --> 01:25:05.506]  Continuing.
[01:25:05.546 --> 01:25:10.510]  Guilty plea in fatal Mason's initiation shooting.
[01:25:12.111 --> 01:25:14.032]  Remember earlier this year?
[01:25:14.052 --> 01:25:20.056]  A Masonic ritual with black altars and goat's heads.
[01:25:21.157 --> 01:25:26.020]  And they were firing a gun by the man's head being initiated and blew his head off.
[01:25:28.602 --> 01:25:30.403]  Same stuff goes on at Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:30.423 --> 01:25:34.126]  They do these mock sacrifices and I guess sometimes it gets a little bit out of control.
[01:25:35.945 --> 01:25:46.791]  And it says, the man who accidentally shot to death a Freemason lodge member in a botched initiation ceremony last year pleaded guilty to homicide charges in a Riverhead court Friday.
[01:25:47.052 --> 01:25:54.076]  Albert Ede, 77, pled guilty to criminally negligent homicide and was sentenced to five years probation.
[01:25:55.537 --> 01:25:59.499]  Five years probation by Suffolk County Court Judge C. Randall.
[01:26:00.059 --> 01:26:04.342]  I wonder if C. Randall Henrich is a member of the lodge...
[01:26:04.975 --> 01:26:12.698]  The plea and sentence were negotiated by prosecutors with the consent of the family of the victim, William James, 47, of Medford.
[01:26:13.378 --> 01:26:15.839]  Folks, I predicted this guy would get probation.
[01:26:17.239 --> 01:26:17.700]  So sick.
[01:26:18.540 --> 01:26:22.581]  A shaken and emotional id wept openly during the sentencing.
[01:26:22.921 --> 01:26:25.202]  William was my friend and it's terrible, he said.
[01:26:25.822 --> 01:26:30.184]  The accident occurred on March 7th in the basement of the Southside Masonic Temple.
[01:26:31.443 --> 01:26:38.984]  James was seated on a chair, this was in Long Island, with ten cans placed on a platform beside his head.
[01:26:39.584 --> 01:26:53.527]  As part of the ceremony, which was for a social club related to that lodge, Ed was to shoot a gun filled with only blanks at James as other lodge brothers knocked over the cans with a stick.
[01:26:54.567 --> 01:26:59.908]  Ed also had a gun loaded with live ammunition, which he showed James to scare him before the ceremony.
[01:27:00.689 --> 01:27:08.315]  But from just 20 feet away, it accidentally pulled out the wrong gun and fired at James, hitting him in the nose and killing him.
[01:27:09.556 --> 01:27:10.636]  I'm going to stop right there.
[01:27:11.957 --> 01:27:16.401]  Number one, I don't believe we can rule this out as not being an accident.
[01:27:17.942 --> 01:27:26.448]  Actually do a search for Klan or Masonic ritual deaths, accidental deaths, accidentally hanging people, accidentally shooting people.
[01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:28.790]  You say, what's the Klan have to do with it?
[01:27:28.850 --> 01:27:29.951]  It's a Masonic organization.
[01:27:31.317 --> 01:27:32.838]  Check the encyclopedia if you don't believe me.
[01:27:34.099 --> 01:27:36.020]  And there's been quite a few of these.
[01:27:36.340 --> 01:27:41.724]  So I'm not sure it's an accident, and they cover it up, and he gets a few years probation.
[01:27:42.764 --> 01:27:48.808]  But even if it is an accident, which I hope it is, I probably can tell you which ritual this is.
[01:27:49.108 --> 01:27:53.691]  They have a whole bunch of them where you go into higher levels of initiation where you have to do blood oaths.
[01:27:54.292 --> 01:27:59.055]  If you ever let any secrets out, you'll kill people, including your family, in order to do so.
[01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:08.327]  And that is you'll go kill people who've let information out or that you understand you're going to be killed if you ever let these secrets out.
[01:28:09.587 --> 01:28:12.970]  And they do lots of this stuff.
[01:28:13.710 --> 01:28:17.272]  So, very Christian.
[01:28:17.492 --> 01:28:20.134]  You know, down there on the black altar shooting people in the head.
[01:28:21.695 --> 01:28:23.096]  Very, very conservative.
[01:28:24.637 --> 01:28:28.139]  When we get back, folks, I haven't even gotten to the really important news yet.
[01:28:28.219 --> 01:28:29.220]  We'll go over it.
[01:28:30.379 --> 01:28:33.341]  And take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:28:33.361 --> 01:28:37.705]  The website, of course, is prisonplanet.tv.

[01:28:45.031 --> 01:28:46.652]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.553 --> 01:28:50.235]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.385 --> 01:28:57.089]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up Technology.

[01:30:55.009 --> 01:31:00.494]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.914 --> 01:31:05.157]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:05.378 --> 01:31:12.423]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:12.804 --> 01:31:18.909]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:18.929 --> 01:31:20.270]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:20.590 --> 01:31:23.552]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[01:32:11.369 --> 01:32:15.271]  Alright, your calls are coming up here in a few minutes, but let's keep going over the news for now.
[01:32:16.592 --> 01:32:20.354]  Bush, the king, blows $50 million on coronation.
[01:32:21.194 --> 01:32:22.315]  The son of the observer.
[01:32:22.975 --> 01:32:27.237]  President's lavish inauguration is obscene when U.S.
[01:32:27.277 --> 01:32:29.919]  troops are dying in Iraq war, says critics.
[01:32:30.703 --> 01:32:32.945]  It will be one of the biggest parties in American history.
[01:32:33.445 --> 01:32:37.848]  But half of the country will be left out with a price tag of up to $50 million.
[01:32:37.908 --> 01:32:41.410]  President George W. Bush's inauguration is 11 days time.
[01:32:41.430 --> 01:32:49.436]  It will be an unabashed celebration of red America's victory over blue America in last November's election.
[01:32:50.333 --> 01:33:15.147]  It is going to be the most expensive, most security-obsessed event in the history of Washington, D.C., an army of 10,000 police, secret service officers, and FBI agents will patrol the Capitol for four days of massive celebrations that some critics have described as reminiscent of the lavish shidlings thrown by Louis XIV, France's extravagant son-king.
[01:33:17.987 --> 01:33:19.227]  Lavish shindigs.
[01:33:19.367 --> 01:33:20.808]  I invented a word there earlier.
[01:33:21.648 --> 01:33:24.189]  Okay, now, here's the deal.
[01:33:24.549 --> 01:33:25.850]  I have the Washington Times.
[01:33:26.650 --> 01:33:30.831]  They are hiring, what is it, 400 members of the TSA.
[01:33:30.891 --> 01:33:33.372]  You know, the people with the turbans who don't speak English.
[01:33:33.412 --> 01:33:35.393]  You broke your wife.
[01:33:37.533 --> 01:33:38.774]  Really, a lot of times it's like that.
[01:33:40.314 --> 01:33:42.175]  At these airports, you've heard the horror stories.
[01:33:42.725 --> 01:33:44.246]  And of course, they're not all in turbans.
[01:33:44.306 --> 01:33:45.147]  I'm being sarcastic.
[01:33:45.187 --> 01:33:49.149]  But in some cases, it really is illegal aliens working there doing this.
[01:33:49.169 --> 01:33:49.890]  It's been on the news.
[01:33:51.131 --> 01:33:55.013]  They're actually hiring them to take them to D.C.
[01:33:55.734 --> 01:34:04.820]  to a special form of psychological behaviorism where the key things you do mean that you're going to be interrogated or arrested.
[01:34:06.471 --> 01:34:09.293]  Any type of criticism, protest, it's just not allowed.
[01:34:09.333 --> 01:34:10.374]  It's in the newspaper.
[01:34:10.994 --> 01:34:13.176]  We're sorry, that might be terror-related.
[01:34:13.196 --> 01:34:21.182]  And so there's going to be 400 of these individuals commanding the police and the National Guard will be out in attendance.
[01:34:21.202 --> 01:34:26.686]  So we're going to have the TSA as the commanders of all this, as I said they would do three years ago.
[01:34:27.945 --> 01:34:42.632]  Not because I have a crystal ball, but because I saw Ridge on television on C-SPAN for two hours with all these big corporate CEOs in one of the office buildings at the Capitol saying that we're going to take what we do in the airports and we're going to duplicate it.
[01:34:42.812 --> 01:34:44.193]  This is even before Ridge got funding.
[01:34:45.293 --> 01:34:46.674]  Right before the funding bill went through.
[01:34:47.598 --> 01:34:58.341]  Saying that it's going to be at the bus terminals, and the highways, and the schools, and you're going to have to have a national ID card to have a job, and they laid it all out.
[01:34:59.161 --> 01:35:06.943]  And so, the type of harassment you get at the airport, you see, is slowly spreading across the nation.
[01:35:08.304 --> 01:35:13.065]  Shifting gears, this is out of the weekly standard that Mr. Crystal edits.
[01:35:13.665 --> 01:35:16.626]  Again, poses as a conservative, neocon chieftain,
[01:35:20.570 --> 01:35:27.072]  And this article, the UN sex scandal, is a good article.
[01:35:27.672 --> 01:35:30.713]  And it's written by Joseph Lokenet.
[01:35:30.773 --> 01:35:33.613]  It just came out a few days ago.
[01:35:33.813 --> 01:35:40.395]  But the article talks about the UN and kidnapping and torture and
[01:35:41.696 --> 01:35:45.298]  Kidnapping children and all the horrible things they do.
[01:35:45.738 --> 01:35:52.042]  The sex trade, white slavery, industrialized, the UN's evil, let's shut them down.
[01:35:52.663 --> 01:35:54.043]  Everywhere they go they do this.
[01:35:54.083 --> 01:35:55.324]  They're a bunch of perverts.
[01:35:56.865 --> 01:36:10.093]  But they don't mention how DynCorp in Serbia contracted with the UN for flying out 200,000 women and children to undisclosed locations as part of the sex trade.
[01:36:12.083 --> 01:36:18.768]  And some of the women were also being flown out just to be slave maids in houses in Saudi Arabia and Malaysia.
[01:36:19.028 --> 01:36:20.689]  And yes, in Israel too, folks.
[01:36:20.709 --> 01:36:24.993]  They're one of the biggest traffickers and users of this.
[01:36:26.714 --> 01:36:36.481]  No mention of how our government gives DynCorp all the big contracts in Iraq for security and the big contracts in Afghanistan and other areas in this country.
[01:36:37.839 --> 01:36:39.440]  Dyncor has since changed their name.
[01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:40.280]  They're not always doing that.
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:43.862]  But the point is, is that they lost the suit.
[01:36:44.623 --> 01:36:46.804]  They fired a Dyncor employee.
[01:36:46.964 --> 01:36:47.584]  Other U.N.
[01:36:47.624 --> 01:36:49.365]  people went public, so Barack will be part of this.
[01:36:50.146 --> 01:36:53.107]  And they took him to civil court and won in civil court.
[01:36:53.308 --> 01:36:53.908]  This came out.
[01:36:54.528 --> 01:37:03.113]  So, see, it's like when they get into Bill Clinton giving nuclear reactors to North Korea and the evil traitor Madeline Albright, oh, she's so bad.
[01:37:04.770 --> 01:37:08.694]  But then there's no mention that it was Donald Rumsfeld making the transfer.
[01:37:09.775 --> 01:37:17.782]  So, see, they have these fake fights to make you think they're against the UN and to make you think they're the moral upstanding people fighting all of this.
[01:37:19.304 --> 01:37:25.790]  Whereas, in reality, the neocons are intimately involved in covering this whole thing up.
[01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:30.513]  And there's so many other examples of this.
[01:37:30.993 --> 01:37:35.994]  I've got an article here out of MSNBC where George Bush and Bill Clinton love each other.
[01:37:36.614 --> 01:37:44.557]  They're buddies, and it shows them hugging and smiling, and man, they really agree on so many policies, which is true.
[01:37:44.577 --> 01:37:46.837]  And they're friends.
[01:37:46.917 --> 01:37:55.400]  Well, yeah, Bill Clinton met with George Herbert Walker Bush 11 times from 1991 to 1992, quietly in private meetings.
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.760]  It was all staged.
[01:37:58.027 --> 01:37:59.889]  The whole election wasn't even real.
[01:38:00.269 --> 01:38:03.912]  It was meant to get Clinton in there to co-opt the Democrats to get the agenda through.
[01:38:04.633 --> 01:38:07.776]  And they were drug dealers together at MENA Arkansas.
[01:38:07.816 --> 01:38:12.140]  I've interviewed the actual CIA officers unloading the cocaine.
[01:38:13.801 --> 01:38:15.223]  So it goes way back, folks.
[01:38:15.663 --> 01:38:17.265]  It's like WWF wrestling.
[01:38:17.605 --> 01:38:24.291]  Hulk Hogan and Macho Man, after they have the grudge match, they go have a beer together and, you know, eat a hamburger.
[01:38:26.257 --> 01:38:36.287]  And I know you want to call me up and say, no, Hulk Hogan and Macho Man really fight, or, you know, The Rock and The Undertaker really fight today, and, you know, it's real.
[01:38:36.307 --> 01:38:38.470]  Look, it's not real, okay?
[01:38:38.910 --> 01:38:46.538]  Well, just like you have to be told that that's not real, some of you, look, politics at this level is staged, folks.
[01:38:46.618 --> 01:38:47.940]  It's totally staged.
[01:38:49.153 --> 01:38:53.875]  Great example, Bush and Kerry being cousins, being members of the same secret society, on and on and on.
[01:38:54.095 --> 01:38:58.658]  Their policies almost identical, and then Kerry doesn't challenge the fraudulent results of the election.
[01:38:59.258 --> 01:39:01.139]  Because it was staged, staged, staged.
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:04.901]  And so they do this over and over again.
[01:39:05.661 --> 01:39:15.946]  And so you read this article, and it's how UN Secretary General Kofi Annan had to admit that UN peacekeepers and staff were sexually abused or exploited war refugees in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
[01:39:18.138 --> 01:39:19.139]  And it goes on and on.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:24.463]  And they talk about the worst of the 150 or so allegations of misconduct.
[01:39:24.883 --> 01:39:25.504]  Misconduct.
[01:39:25.924 --> 01:39:30.688]  Some of them captured on video include pedophilia, rape, and prostitution.
[01:39:31.668 --> 01:39:40.435]  Folks, we had photos of UN troops, as in the new American, barbecuing small children over fires and beating them to death.
[01:39:42.217 --> 01:39:43.998]  I mean, that was six, seven years ago.
[01:39:45.228 --> 01:39:45.628]  But again, 150?
[01:39:45.668 --> 01:39:53.590]  The UN has been convicted in civil court of 200,000 in one country!
[01:39:56.551 --> 01:39:59.091]  But again, see, that's how they manage the news.
[01:39:59.911 --> 01:40:10.714]  Here's a press release, news release, headquarters, United States Central Command, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, for immediate release.
[01:40:10.794 --> 01:40:13.435]  Detainee dies of apparent natural causes.
[01:40:13.475 --> 01:40:14.575]  We see one of these every week.
[01:40:15.643 --> 01:40:22.654]  A security detainee died Wednesday afternoon at Camp Bucca, internment facility, of what appears to be natural causes.
[01:40:22.694 --> 01:40:25.198]  An autopsy is pending to determine the cause of death.
[01:40:25.218 --> 01:40:28.763]  Detainees notified the guards at approximately 2.40 p.m.
[01:40:28.783 --> 01:40:30.446]  that the individual appeared to be suffering.
[01:40:31.227 --> 01:40:32.308]  A medical problem.
[01:40:32.368 --> 01:40:37.250]  A medic immediately provided life-saving first aid for what appeared to be cardiac arrest.
[01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:45.754]  The detainee was immediately transferred to the internment facility aid station where the medical staff continued life-saving measures which failed to revive him.
[01:40:47.175 --> 01:40:56.500]  He was a 31-year-old male who had been, who had held as an internee since August 2004 as a threat to the security of Iraq.
[01:40:56.540 --> 01:40:58.841]  He was not being treated for any medical conditions.
[01:41:01.733 --> 01:41:21.019]  So, just a lot of 20-year-olds, 18-year-olds, 35-year-olds, and then later the families get the bodies, and there's burn marks, shot marks on the bottom of their feet, teeth pulled out with pliers, fingernails all missing, bruises from head to toe.
[01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:26.501]  And they just give them to the family and go, he had a heart attack!
[01:41:27.276 --> 01:41:28.297]  I don't know about this case.
[01:41:29.017 --> 01:41:31.439]  This just came out, but we've seen many of these.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:34.342]  Oh, just, he had a boo-boo, you know.
[01:41:35.483 --> 01:41:36.784]  Just had a little problem.
[01:41:37.144 --> 01:41:38.785]  Well, this was a war after all.
[01:41:42.488 --> 01:41:47.492]  Pentagon considering assassinations and kidnapping special forces in Iraq.
[01:41:47.812 --> 01:41:48.793]  Oh, and guess what?
[01:41:49.093 --> 01:41:52.516]  This is a positive article from an SNBC.
[01:41:52.836 --> 01:41:56.259]  By positive, they just talk about it being pretty good, you know.
[01:41:59.068 --> 01:42:04.211]  And then they just come right out and say that, well, yeah, we're going to start.
[01:42:05.712 --> 01:42:09.894]  And they even name it after Latin American operations where they kill whole families.
[01:42:10.755 --> 01:42:11.835]  We have a little comment here.
[01:42:12.195 --> 01:42:17.458]  Practicing terrorism, the name of fighting terrorism, we need to be told that terrorists kidnap and kill people.
[01:42:17.979 --> 01:42:20.420]  I guess it becomes moral when the authorities are behind it.
[01:42:22.370 --> 01:42:26.615]  And the MSNBC begins, What to do about the deepening quagmire of Iraq?
[01:42:26.675 --> 01:42:30.579]  The Pentagon's latest approach is being called the Salvador Option.
[01:42:32.125 --> 01:42:37.831]  And the fact that it is being discussed at all is a measure of just how worried Donald Rumsfeld really is.
[01:42:38.231 --> 01:42:42.215]  What everyone agrees is that we can't go on as we are.
[01:42:42.395 --> 01:42:47.860]  One senior military officer told Newsweek, we have to find a way to take the offensive against the insurgents.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:50.883]  Right now, we are playing defense, and we are losing.
[01:42:51.103 --> 01:42:52.024]  Well, you're losing.
[01:42:52.485 --> 01:42:55.608]  Last November's operation in Fallujah, most analysts agreed.
[01:42:56.933 --> 01:43:05.695]  Succeeded less in breaking the back of the insurgency, as Marine General John Sattler optimistically declared at the time, than it did in spreading it.
[01:43:05.775 --> 01:43:08.015]  Folks, the Pentagon knew it was going to spread it.
[01:43:08.595 --> 01:43:22.777]  They know that when one sniper shoots at somebody, and they arrest all the men in a town of 5,000, down to age 10, and then bulldoze every date palm, every tangerine orchard, I mean, they know.
[01:43:23.318 --> 01:43:25.898]  They know, folks, that they've made everybody the enemy.
[01:43:26.815 --> 01:43:27.516]  This is the plan.
[01:43:27.596 --> 01:43:29.437]  It's P2OG, the Pentagon plan.
[01:43:29.797 --> 01:43:35.922]  We enrage the Arab world to make them fight even harder, to widen the war so the globalists make more money prosecuting the war.
[01:43:36.643 --> 01:43:40.806]  And so then we can be seen as the bad cop at the end of it, and the UN comes in as the savior.
[01:43:41.387 --> 01:43:52.216]  Now Newsweek has learned the Pentagon is intensively debating an option that dates back to the still-secret strategy in the Reagan administration's battle against the leftist guerrilla insurgency in El Salvador in the early 80s.
[01:43:53.556 --> 01:44:09.986]  Now, again, a month ago we got the mainstream articles out of Latin America where thousands, thousands of the former torture masters and secret police and known drug dealers are being hired upwards of $200,000 to $300,000 a year to go there and do this.
[01:44:10.266 --> 01:44:16.830]  They can't even find enough of our soldiers to torture and kill and murder, so they're hiring the Latin American death squads.
[01:44:17.250 --> 01:44:18.591]  But here it is in MSNBC.
[01:44:19.212 --> 01:44:22.013]  Then faced with a losing war against Salvadoran rebels, the U.S.
[01:44:22.033 --> 01:44:23.034]  government funded...
[01:44:24.329 --> 01:44:34.016]  Or supported nationalist forces that allegedly included so-called death squads, directed to pump down and kill rebel leaders and sympathizers.
[01:44:34.136 --> 01:44:36.878]  Eventually, the insurgency was quelled, and many U.S.
[01:44:36.918 --> 01:44:38.879]  conservatives considered... Yeah, you're conservatives.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:41.741]  Banning 50 cows, pro-abortion, everything.
[01:44:42.062 --> 01:44:49.587]  The policy to have been a success despite the deaths of innocent civilians and the subsequent Iran-Contra arms for hostage scandal...
[01:44:50.589 --> 01:44:52.751]  Again, arming al-Qaeda in Iran, as usual.
[01:44:53.091 --> 01:45:00.777]  According to current administration officials who dealt with Central America back then, is John Necroponte, who was sent to Iraq, who is today the U.S.
[01:45:00.817 --> 01:45:02.438]  ambassador to Iraq under Reagan.
[01:45:02.718 --> 01:45:05.260]  He was ambassador to Honduras.
[01:45:08.282 --> 01:45:16.408]  Following that model, one Pentagon proposal would send special forces teams to advise, support, and possibly train Iraqi soldiers, most likely hand-picked Kurdish soldiers.
[01:45:17.234 --> 01:45:28.203]  Fighters and Shiite militiamen to target Sunni insurgents and their sympathizers even cross the border into Syria and attack, according to military insiders familiar with the discussions.
[01:45:28.864 --> 01:45:38.632]  It remains unclear, however, whether this would be a policy of assassination or so-called snatch and grab operations in which the targets are sent to secret facilities for interrogation.
[01:45:39.913 --> 01:45:44.076]  Ah, then we can hear about 18-year-olds and 31-year-olds dying of heart attacks, can't we?
[01:45:45.377 --> 01:45:46.558]  His heart just gave out
[01:45:47.526 --> 01:45:53.631]  It looks like he was put through a wood chipper, but that's what happens when you have a heart attack.
[01:45:55.152 --> 01:45:55.953]  Didn't you know that?
[01:45:55.993 --> 01:45:57.494]  We're just blowing off some steam.
[01:45:58.715 --> 01:45:59.375]  Here's another one.
[01:45:59.395 --> 01:46:00.676]  This is out of the advertiser.
[01:46:02.558 --> 01:46:09.143]  Soldier who made Iraqis jump off bridge, killing one, gets just six months, is not discharged.
[01:46:10.436 --> 01:46:16.321]  And it says that the young men were caught out after 9 o'clock at night, breaking their curfew.
[01:46:16.361 --> 01:46:18.563]  They said they were coming back from visiting a friend's house.
[01:46:19.383 --> 01:46:21.845]  And so they drowned them systematically.
[01:46:24.507 --> 01:46:27.630]  And, well, you know, that's just what you get.
[01:46:28.450 --> 01:46:30.692]  Here's Paul Watson's comment above this.
[01:46:31.513 --> 01:46:36.357]  If a police officer had done this in America, would he be allowed back on the force?
[01:46:36.917 --> 01:46:37.698]  They are able to get
[01:46:38.670 --> 01:46:47.738]  Off so lightly because of one overriding precept, that Iraqis are subhuman and thus you can treat them ten times worse than anybody else.
[01:46:48.538 --> 01:46:50.920]  This truly obliterates the myth that the U.S.
[01:46:50.960 --> 01:46:52.382]  is over there to liberate them.
[01:46:52.682 --> 01:46:58.307]  Remember, the cardinal sin committed by the Iraqis was that they broke a 9 p.m.
[01:46:58.347 --> 01:46:58.767]  curfew.
[01:46:58.807 --> 01:47:02.490]  Curfews were another example of how we gave them freedom.
[01:47:03.411 --> 01:47:04.752]  Up is down, down is up.
[01:47:06.573 --> 01:47:19.879]  Well, now they say the people back in the Fallujah have been given ID cards with retina scans, and they even said on NBC, they said on NBC Nightly News, if you're caught going anywhere but your house or to work or to an aid station, you are killed.
[01:47:20.399 --> 01:47:21.860]  Deadly force, they blow your head off.
[01:47:23.740 --> 01:47:24.360]  Here's another one.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:28.323]  Sharon considered Mideast war to distract from corruption probe.
[01:47:28.343 --> 01:47:30.024]  This is in the major Israeli papers.
[01:47:30.424 --> 01:47:42.791]  One of the most conservative members of Sharon's party has gone public saying that Sharon said to distract from his corruption probe that they might need to go ahead and invade local Arab countries as a distraction.
[01:47:45.112 --> 01:47:46.413]  Here's that article I mentioned earlier.
[01:47:47.299 --> 01:47:52.363]  Metro officers keep a keen eye on riders' new behavioral profiling techniques.
[01:47:52.404 --> 01:47:55.646]  TSA training help target suspicious subway passengers.
[01:47:55.666 --> 01:48:00.350]  9-1-1 and the passion top at the People's Choice Awards.
[01:48:01.652 --> 01:48:05.695]  Two controversial films that define the odds to earn millions.
[01:48:06.276 --> 01:48:10.499]  Two controversial films that defy the odds to earn millions at the box office.
[01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:13.602]  Joined a familiar green...
[01:48:15.559 --> 01:48:19.624]  Or get to take top honors at the 31st Annual People's Choice Awards.
[01:48:19.984 --> 01:48:22.847]  The Passion of the Christ and Fahrenheit 9-11 both won.
[01:48:23.548 --> 01:48:29.354]  Showing, I would say, that people want alternative news, alternative forms of information.
[01:48:30.455 --> 01:48:32.718]  They are sick and tired of establishment pap.
[01:48:35.345 --> 01:48:38.906]  Presidents Bubba and W warming up to each other.
[01:48:38.966 --> 01:48:39.726]  Again, I mentioned this.
[01:48:39.866 --> 01:48:42.967]  MSNBC shows them smiling and loving each other.
[01:48:43.567 --> 01:48:54.371]  For years now, George W used to call him the shadow and promised a fresh start by pledging to uphold the honor and dignity of the presidency and blocking Dan Burton's committee that could have had Bill Clinton arrested.
[01:48:54.731 --> 01:49:02.073]  He even joked to late night TV's David Letterman that one of the top ten priorities in the White House would be to give the Oval Office one heck of a scrubbing.
[01:49:02.699 --> 01:49:08.083]  But then President Bush welcomed Bill Clinton into that same office last week.
[01:49:08.123 --> 01:49:14.327]  Those barbs were ancient history after Clinton remarked how much he liked the new Oval Office rug.
[01:49:14.407 --> 01:49:15.187]  Bush encouraged him.
[01:49:15.507 --> 01:49:18.249]  Folks, this is sick.
[01:49:19.910 --> 01:49:20.851]  This is totally sick.
[01:49:21.291 --> 01:49:27.095]  I mean, when Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 41, isn't giving Schwarzenegger awards, he's giving them to Ted Kennedy.
[01:49:27.855 --> 01:49:28.696]  How much he loves him.
[01:49:29.616 --> 01:49:30.577]  It's all staged.
[01:49:31.513 --> 01:49:37.676]  All right, we'll come back, take calls, then get into 85-year-old man beaten, pepper sprayed by police.
[01:49:38.576 --> 01:49:40.857]  Wait till you hear why this World War II vet was beaten.
[01:49:41.238 --> 01:49:46.480]  And a bunch of key antidepressant news.
[01:49:47.381 --> 01:49:50.302]  Prozac, Eli Lilly knew it was 1,200 times higher suicide rate.
[01:49:52.825 --> 01:49:54.766]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:54.947 --> 01:49:58.029]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.169 --> 01:50:02.072]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.112 --> 01:50:06.355]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:06.695 --> 01:50:10.477]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.618 --> 01:50:12.439]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:15.682 --> 01:50:20.688]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:20.828 --> 01:50:23.872]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:50:24.052 --> 01:50:26.915]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.416 --> 01:50:33.543]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.043 --> 01:50:35.885]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:52.708 --> 01:50:57.310]  The Berkey Security Pack is your one-stop solution for unexpected emergencies.
[01:50:57.530 --> 01:51:01.972]  It provides you with purified water, light, power, and communications ability.
[01:51:02.152 --> 01:51:16.157]  The Security Pack includes a Berkey light water purifier, an LED base, two Berkey sport filtration bottles, the Berkey battery adapter, the Berkey MP solar charger, as well as a backup set of two Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:51:16.397 --> 01:51:18.999]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:51:19.019 --> 01:51:20.100]  The Berkey Security Pack.
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:21.481]  A retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:45.920]  We're good to go.
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:46.181]  I think?
[01:52:09.031 --> 01:52:09.411]  Thank you.
[01:52:24.522 --> 01:52:24.882]  We're good to go.
[01:52:55.784 --> 01:53:01.806]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:53:02.426 --> 01:53:05.367]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:16.963 --> 01:53:23.006]  If we accept them murdering Iraqi children and torturing people to death and the rest of it, it's all going to come back on us.
[01:53:24.146 --> 01:53:28.628]  The establishment that's getting away with it over there is also getting away with it over here.
[01:53:30.569 --> 01:53:31.289]  And it's wrong.
[01:53:31.349 --> 01:53:32.410]  It's very, very dangerous.
[01:53:35.011 --> 01:53:41.274]  Before I go to Larry and Ruth and John and Sheila and Jerry and everybody else, there's so much news coming up the next hour.
[01:53:41.294 --> 01:53:46.236]  Just briefly, PrisonPlanet.tv, all 11 of my films...
[01:53:47.040 --> 01:53:49.441]  Dozens of other films have been authorized to post.
[01:53:49.881 --> 01:54:02.506]  The latest that's going up, we just got authorized by the wonderful producer of Muhammad Atta and the Flying Circus on 9-11, Daniel Hopsinger, to post it.
[01:54:02.526 --> 01:54:06.648]  That's going to be going up on prisonplanet.tv here in the next day or two.
[01:54:07.248 --> 01:54:09.129]  This prisonplanet.tv is wonderful.

[01:54:44.702 --> 01:54:46.623]  All right, Larry in Louisiana, thanks for holding.
[01:54:46.663 --> 01:54:47.044]  Go ahead.
[01:54:47.624 --> 01:54:52.067]  Hey, Alex, have you ever read Scott Fitzgerald's books?
[01:54:54.729 --> 01:54:55.850]  Refresh my memory.
[01:54:57.191 --> 01:55:04.656]  He wrote some time back, I can't remember the exact dates, about the rich global elite that had taken charge of government through the use of money.
[01:55:04.676 --> 01:55:07.218]  Yeah, I don't think I've read his books.
[01:55:07.738 --> 01:55:08.179]  Okay, good.
[01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:11.701]  What I called you about was a news story, a mainstream news story.
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:18.262]  The day of the earthquake, they said that the Earth was actually rocked on its rotation axis.
[01:55:18.962 --> 01:55:21.663]  And the Earth sped up, too.
[01:55:21.743 --> 01:55:23.383]  The spinning is sped up.
[01:55:23.923 --> 01:55:25.064]  Okay, well, that's what they said.
[01:55:25.124 --> 01:55:26.784]  The day was incrementally shorter.
[01:55:27.185 --> 01:55:29.785]  Could you get a hold of somebody from Fort Collins, Colorado?
[01:55:29.825 --> 01:55:35.527]  Because every eight years or so, they have to adjust the atomic clock in nanoseconds, which a nanosecond... Well, they said what it was.
[01:55:35.627 --> 01:55:37.888]  It was the Earth...
[01:55:39.341 --> 01:55:49.486]  Got smaller by 8 millimeters, 8 millimeters, and it spun up some tiny percentage of a second, I forget.
[01:55:49.986 --> 01:55:51.727]  And we're still spinning faster now.
[01:55:52.647 --> 01:55:54.108]  Okay, that's what I was wondering.
[01:55:54.188 --> 01:55:56.429]  It's still in a different rotation state.
[01:55:56.469 --> 01:56:00.711]  A nanosecond is the time it takes the electron to move one pass around a hydrogen element.
[01:56:01.712 --> 01:56:03.052]  It was a percentage of a second.
[01:56:03.092 --> 01:56:04.593]  It was a lot bigger than a nanosecond.
[01:56:05.009 --> 01:56:08.690]  It was even bigger than nanoseconds, and it's still in an accelerated rate of rotation.
[01:56:08.730 --> 01:56:10.490]  Yeah, but the Earth speeds up and slows down.
[01:56:10.530 --> 01:56:11.691]  I mean, that happens.
[01:56:12.351 --> 01:56:13.631]  That's been measured before?
[01:56:13.791 --> 01:56:14.011]  Yes.
[01:56:14.051 --> 01:56:16.692]  Do you have news stories that that's been reported before?
[01:56:17.052 --> 01:56:17.232]  Yes.
[01:56:17.252 --> 01:56:17.772]  Yes, I saw that.
[01:56:18.852 --> 01:56:24.414]  And it is confirmed that Diego Garcia was warned, and they then warned the British base there.
[01:56:24.914 --> 01:56:25.354]  Well, sure.
[01:56:25.594 --> 01:56:27.534]  They have submarine sensors in every ocean.
[01:56:27.795 --> 01:56:28.595]  The whole thing was known.
[01:56:28.635 --> 01:56:29.715]  They just didn't warn the people.
[01:56:30.754 --> 01:56:31.735]  The animals knew, didn't they?
[01:56:31.875 --> 01:56:35.297]  Well, it's admitted now that they had like two hours warning but didn't warn anybody.
[01:56:35.337 --> 01:56:35.978]  I wonder why.
[01:56:35.998 --> 01:56:41.042]  Well, I think you have to have a big tax to go save somebody, don't you?
[01:56:42.002 --> 01:56:43.283]  It makes a great diversion.
[01:56:43.343 --> 01:56:45.065]  I mean, they certainly knew and did nothing.
[01:56:45.085 --> 01:56:51.970]  You know, the stories of did the government cause it, I mean, I don't go there because I can't prove it, but now everybody's starting to say that.
[01:56:52.845 --> 01:56:53.845]  Okay.
[01:56:53.885 --> 01:56:54.966]  Let me ask you another question.
[01:56:55.006 --> 01:57:01.108]  Have you ever listened to a release in 1964 by Robert Zimmerman called Ballad of a Thin Man?
[01:57:03.129 --> 01:57:03.689]  I think so.
[01:57:04.549 --> 01:57:05.389]  Yeah, what do you make of that?
[01:57:05.429 --> 01:57:05.710]  Anything?
[01:57:06.130 --> 01:57:09.651]  It reminds me of you walking through the Bohemian Grove, I'll tell you.
[01:57:10.171 --> 01:57:11.412]  Well, send me a copy of it.
[01:57:12.112 --> 01:57:12.512]  Okay.
[01:57:13.232 --> 01:57:14.173]  All right, good to hear from you.
[01:57:14.193 --> 01:57:14.693]  I appreciate it.
[01:57:14.713 --> 01:57:15.533]  Interesting call.
[01:57:15.913 --> 01:57:17.354]  We'll start the third hour.
[01:57:17.434 --> 01:57:20.915]  Paul Watson for his once-a-week jaunt with us.
[01:57:21.918 --> 01:57:22.698]  We'll be joining us.
[01:57:22.718 --> 01:57:25.340]  We'll go to your calls as well, very early in this hour.
[01:57:25.820 --> 01:57:28.441]  In fact, by the second segment, we'll go right to your calls in the second segment.
[01:57:29.381 --> 01:57:31.682]  Ruth and John and Sheila and Jerry and everybody else.
[01:57:32.202 --> 01:57:33.843]  And there's just so much news.
[01:57:34.763 --> 01:57:42.007]  Just so much that we haven't even gotten to yet about the drugging of the public, about tasering 85-year-old veterans, you name it.
[01:57:49.570 --> 01:57:50.150]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.868 --> 01:57:51.928]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.629 --> 01:57:53.769]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.389 --> 01:57:55.209]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.969 --> 01:57:56.870]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.530 --> 01:58:01.191]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.711 --> 01:58:08.493]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:16.595 --> 01:58:20.036]  It has been a jam-packed radio broadcast so far.
[01:58:23.812 --> 01:58:30.694]  We've covered about 40 different articles, and I've got about another 40 or so I want to cover before this hour ends.
[01:58:31.494 --> 01:58:33.195]  And we've got loaded phone lines, of course.
[01:58:35.075 --> 01:58:44.638]  We're joined for this hour, because I always love his insight, at least once a week, by Paul Watson, my webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:45.739 --> 01:58:49.100]  Paul, there's a lot to talk about in this hour.
[01:58:49.140 --> 01:58:50.520]  What's some of the news you want to go over?
[01:58:52.003 --> 01:58:58.926]  Well maybe we could start off with this, I believe you may have talked about it already, this political paranoia bill.
[01:58:59.807 --> 01:59:14.173]  There's a story that's been circulating for the last few days which centres around Senator Bill Frist and a proposed plan to introduce a bill that would define political paranoia as a mental disorder.
[01:59:15.814 --> 01:59:16.834]  So what does that mean?
[01:59:17.394 --> 01:59:20.736]  It means if you think raping Iraqi children is wrong then you're insane.
[01:59:21.539 --> 01:59:23.040]  Well then I'd say we've all gone quite mad, Paul!
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:23.160]  Yeah.
[01:59:47.105 --> 02:00:04.132]  The thing about it is the story, the only source I can find on it at the moment, although it's circulating around the internet, the source is a left-wing website called the Swift Report, which, from what I can tell, carries some serious stories and some which look like satire.
[02:00:04.872 --> 02:00:15.636]  You know, when I saw that, I thought it may not be true, but what we know is the American Psychological Association has added hundreds of new mental illnesses and designations
[02:00:16.735 --> 02:00:22.381]  Well I can tell you what is real and that is a similar thing that's going on in the UK.
[02:00:38.131 --> 02:00:47.298]  Called the Mental Capacity Bill, which defines mental illness as the inability to make a decision, even if that's temporary.
[02:00:48.018 --> 02:00:57.645]  So if you've had one too many whiskies, they can basically burst into your home, call you mentally incapacitated, grab you, and imprison you indefinitely.
[02:00:57.685 --> 02:01:01.548]  The terms in the legislation are so broad that it allows them to do that.
[02:01:02.889 --> 02:01:03.789]  With this first thing...
[02:01:05.462 --> 02:01:12.624]  I called the office from the number which was on his website in Tennessee, and it's just an automated system.
[02:01:12.684 --> 02:01:13.964]  All you do is leave a message.
[02:01:13.984 --> 02:01:16.105]  There's no way to actually get any comment on it.
[02:01:16.765 --> 02:01:20.286]  So if anyone can confirm that with any other source, then I'd appreciate it.
[02:01:21.106 --> 02:01:29.849]  But as you've said, we've seen moves in the past which are all geared towards this, and in fact we had top Soviet defectors just a couple of months ago.
[02:01:30.900 --> 02:01:39.845]  went on record to warn about it, that they want to define basic political activism or opposition to authority as mental instability.
[02:01:40.706 --> 02:01:43.027]  And obviously that's what the Soviets did in the past.
[02:01:44.088 --> 02:01:54.834]  So I'll put out a blurb article this evening on the website and we can confirm whether or not it's disinfo, but as I said, in the UK it's already happening, the bill's already in session.
[02:01:57.729 --> 02:01:59.411]  Alright, we're going to talk about that.
[02:01:59.551 --> 02:02:16.045]  I also want to spend some more time on Armstrong Williams because $240,000 to go out and push the UN UNESCO No Child Left Behind Bill Clinton's Baby that his good friend George W. got passed.
[02:02:16.605 --> 02:02:24.612]  I want to talk about propaganda placement and go over some past examples of this that dwarf what Armstrong Williams is up to.
[02:02:25.766 --> 02:02:28.668]  And really discuss for listeners how serious this is.
[02:02:29.088 --> 02:02:31.169]  I mean, how openly this shows the propaganda.
[02:02:31.449 --> 02:02:37.253]  But first your calls, and we'll also cover an 85-year-old man beaten, pepper sprayed by police.
[02:02:37.733 --> 02:02:39.234]  I'm going to try to get him on the broadcast.
[02:02:39.594 --> 02:02:40.335]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:40.355 --> 02:02:40.775]  Stay with us.
[02:02:44.988 --> 02:02:49.333]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.513 --> 02:02:53.938]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.078 --> 02:02:58.443]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.503 --> 02:02:59.885]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.627 --> 02:03:05.852]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:05.912 --> 02:03:12.860]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.982]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.503 --> 02:03:19.907]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:03:44.427 --> 02:03:47.909]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:48.169 --> 02:03:51.651]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:51.751 --> 02:03:55.713]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:55.913 --> 02:04:02.096]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:02.496 --> 02:04:10.400]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:10.820 --> 02:04:11.540]  We're good to go.
[02:04:26.186 --> 02:04:29.368]  You get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:04:29.408 --> 02:04:36.033]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:36.093 --> 02:04:36.473]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.533 --> 02:04:37.394]  Protect your family.
[02:04:44.511 --> 02:04:51.814]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic-resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[02:04:52.174 --> 02:04:56.855]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[02:04:57.075 --> 02:05:00.957]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[02:05:01.177 --> 02:05:04.118]  Super Silver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:20.127]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[02:05:20.447 --> 02:05:26.731]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[02:05:26.971 --> 02:05:27.271]  Big Brother.
[02:05:27.291 --> 02:05:27.531]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.323 --> 02:05:55.226]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.967 --> 02:05:56.888]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.529 --> 02:06:01.212]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.733 --> 02:06:05.817]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:14.820 --> 02:06:17.881]  All right, eight minutes into our number three.
[02:06:17.901 --> 02:06:22.843]  We're talking to Paul Watson on this Monday edition, the 10th day of January, 05.
[02:06:23.783 --> 02:06:25.344]  Your calls are coming up here momentarily.
[02:06:25.364 --> 02:06:28.725]  Paul, what's some of the other news that we're going to be covering after these calls?
[02:06:30.046 --> 02:06:38.509]  Well, we're going to be covering the passage of a bill which creates a secret government to enact laws basically in secret after a terrorist attack.
[02:06:39.663 --> 02:06:48.430]  Further liberation in Iraq with this sergeant being charged just six months and not being discharged from the army for making Iraqis jump off a bridge.
[02:06:49.351 --> 02:06:56.697]  And if you thought Limbaugh was bad with his just blowing off steam comments, then wait until you hear what Ann Coulter had to say.
[02:06:57.959 --> 02:07:03.443]  Oh, was that the comment last week where she said, let's nuke people for fun and let's kill more civilians?
[02:07:04.484 --> 02:07:05.065]  That's right, yeah.
[02:07:06.129 --> 02:07:08.450]  Yeah, well, that's loving.
[02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:12.571]  And then I want to get back into Armstrong Williams and the payoffs.
[02:07:12.591 --> 02:07:13.631]  I mean, it's a payoff, folks.
[02:07:14.071 --> 02:07:15.171]  Ruth in Pennsylvania.
[02:07:15.191 --> 02:07:15.711]  Thanks for holding.
[02:07:15.731 --> 02:07:16.331]  Go ahead, Ruth.
[02:07:17.152 --> 02:07:19.872]  Yes, I had a comment on something I saw on C-SPAN.
[02:07:19.892 --> 02:07:27.434]  But first I wanted to clear up this article that was on rent about going to Congress to legislate psychiatric diagnosis.
[02:07:27.874 --> 02:07:34.016]  I don't know what the procedure is in the U.K., like Paul Watson was saying, but I don't know what they can legislate there.
[02:07:34.056 --> 02:07:35.196]  But in America you can't.
[02:07:35.583 --> 02:07:36.403]  Well, they have
[02:08:02.012 --> 02:08:04.613]  Oppositional... Defiance, that's an old one.
[02:08:04.814 --> 02:08:07.915]  Yeah, but I mean, there's hundreds of them now.
[02:08:07.935 --> 02:08:11.957]  I mean, I've had psychiatrists and psychologists on, and actually it's a revolving door.
[02:08:12.057 --> 02:08:30.207]  Congress funds the programs and funds the organizations that are creating these new designations, and they have funded the new Freedom Initiative that did codify a manual on what is mental illness, written widely so the drug companies that wrote it can put more children on drugs.
[02:08:30.387 --> 02:08:31.868]  I'm not saying there's not a marriage there.
[02:08:31.888 --> 02:08:34.689]  It's just Fritz can't go to Congress and say, let's legislate that.
[02:08:35.089 --> 02:08:37.430]  I mean, when that happens, everyone better throw in the towel.
[02:08:37.710 --> 02:08:42.353]  I'm not saying there's not a marriage between these organizations, but I thought... Well, I'm not saying it's true either.
[02:08:42.433 --> 02:08:44.073]  A caller called in about the article.
[02:08:44.514 --> 02:08:48.295]  Yeah, but I would just leave that one alone as some kind of rumor.
[02:08:49.076 --> 02:08:53.098]  But anyway, I saw something on C-SPAN that totally blew me away.
[02:08:53.118 --> 02:08:53.958]  Sure, tell us about it.
[02:08:54.138 --> 02:08:57.320]  Okay, there was a panel of experts on terrorists, and...
[02:08:59.036 --> 02:08:59.956]  And there was a woman there.
[02:09:00.016 --> 02:09:01.637]  Her name was either Stern or Stein.
[02:09:01.677 --> 02:09:04.118]  And they were going on a lot about international terrorists.
[02:09:04.498 --> 02:09:08.880]  Then all of a sudden she's talking about their capability of getting nuclear devices in their hands.
[02:09:09.221 --> 02:09:13.082]  And she's talking about the international groups who want to do that and how that would happen.
[02:09:13.102 --> 02:09:17.644]  And she was their keynote speaker and seemed to be their most respected panelist.
[02:09:18.164 --> 02:09:21.706]  And she shocked me when she started talking about American terrorists.
[02:09:22.219 --> 02:09:31.883]  She specifically identified the American militia and said that these groups in America would love to get their hands on nuclear devices, but she thinks they never will be able to.
[02:09:31.903 --> 02:09:34.205]  Well, yeah, that's been the script for years.
[02:09:34.645 --> 02:09:37.626]  The general public's told, oh, it's just for the Muslims.
[02:09:38.266 --> 02:09:43.549]  But meanwhile, it's for homeschoolers, conservatives, gun owners, liberal groups.
[02:09:44.129 --> 02:09:50.252]  All the real training is for Americans, regardless of your race, color, or creed or whatever.
[02:09:50.972 --> 02:09:52.473]  And this is really going on.
[02:09:52.493 --> 02:10:00.016]  I mean, you have that Harvard newspaper article, Paul, where they listed the most dangerous terrorists as those that believe in the New World Order, Paul.
[02:10:01.597 --> 02:10:02.357]  Yeah, we see it again.
[02:10:02.397 --> 02:10:06.059]  There was a CNN piece in 2002 which said the same thing.
[02:10:06.079 --> 02:10:12.502]  This whole thing about dirty bombs and nuclear bombs and who's going to get hold of them is, of course, complete hypocrisy.
[02:10:13.246 --> 02:10:21.091]  Because the world trade in nuclear weapons is fostered by the globalists, and that's not just things like Rumsfeld selling the nukes to North Korea.
[02:10:21.711 --> 02:10:28.195]  I mean, every time someone gets caught trying to traffic nuclear weapons, it comes out that they're working directly for the U.S.
[02:10:28.215 --> 02:10:32.037]  government, and they then say, oh, what an amazing job we did.
[02:10:32.057 --> 02:10:34.879]  It was a sting operation, so conveniently.
[02:10:35.479 --> 02:10:37.801]  And then in places like Pakistan with...
[02:10:38.920 --> 02:10:43.624]  Professor Kahn, who was trying to sell nukes to North Korea and Libya.
[02:10:43.684 --> 02:10:48.989]  And that was part of W1999 that Clinton had signed, and then Bush reissued it, saying, leave Kahn alone.
[02:10:50.230 --> 02:11:00.819]  Yeah, so the whole trade around the world is fostered by the globalists and these neocons who then say that American citizens are going to get their hands on them, and that we should watch American citizens when they're the ones doing it.
[02:11:00.839 --> 02:11:04.443]  Then they have shows like 24, where the evil militia nukes L.A.,
[02:11:06.648 --> 02:11:10.590]  Yeah, working with the Muslim terrorists.
[02:11:11.410 --> 02:11:18.093]  What shocked me was that she was calling Americans terrorists, and I just don't believe that there's large groups of Americans doing that.
[02:11:18.533 --> 02:11:26.877]  You know, I mean, there might be a loose cannon, wacko fringe person that wants... I just find that very chilling to refer to Americans as terrorists.
[02:11:27.337 --> 02:11:28.577]  Of course, thanks for the call.
[02:11:28.638 --> 02:11:34.200]  Oh, they do this... Look, most of the real anti-terror training is going on right now
[02:11:35.356 --> 02:11:38.017]  I mean, Paul, just a few months ago, the whole thing with the homeschoolers.
[02:11:38.937 --> 02:11:53.080]  The feds told the school district, do drills, where homeschooler families come and slaughter hundreds of children, have fake blood, have the small middle school and elementary students take part in it, put fake blood on them and tell them the homeschoolers are going to kill you.
[02:11:54.260 --> 02:11:57.001]  Well, yeah, first they said this is all geared towards Arabs.
[02:11:57.739 --> 02:12:02.941]  And then it became Arab Americans with the Jose Padilla case, who they're now trying to imprison indefinitely.
[02:12:02.981 --> 02:12:08.644]  There was no evidence against him on any grounds, but he's indefinitely interned in a Navy brig.
[02:12:09.324 --> 02:12:12.105]  So it's going to shift from Arab Americans to Americans.
[02:12:12.165 --> 02:12:12.786]  That's the plan.
[02:12:12.806 --> 02:12:13.486]  That's what they're doing.
[02:12:14.756 --> 02:12:26.442]  And by the way, folks, there's a new article out by Pat Shannon, American Free Press, and I already knew that the BATF did drills of blowing up rider trucks full of ammonium nitrate out in New Mexico.
[02:12:26.482 --> 02:12:31.124]  We've covered this with our sources, but now the documents have actually been released.
[02:12:32.164 --> 02:12:50.175]  The guy on the ground who called the headquarters within 10 minutes and said an AMFO bomb, how did he know, just went off, was the guy who ran a secret National Security Agency, or National Security Council, excuse me, NSC, drill of blowing these up.
[02:12:50.776 --> 02:12:54.498]  And then he's there that morning and calls and tells everyone what it is.
[02:12:55.298 --> 02:12:56.259]  Very interesting, Paul.
[02:12:57.757 --> 02:13:17.868]  Yeah, and then the thing is, the people who point out the Middle Eastern connection, which there was a connection, then use that as grounds to say that we were attacked by Iraq back in 95, therefore justifying the invasion, failing to mention the articles out of the LA Times and Washington Post back in 93, where Clinton and Bush Sr.
[02:13:17.888 --> 02:13:19.829]  brought these Iraqis in in the first place.
[02:13:20.469 --> 02:13:23.671]  Now, I even wrote an article about that three years ago, and I said, you watch...
[02:13:24.455 --> 02:13:26.437]  Why didn't they point out that it was Iraqis?
[02:13:26.477 --> 02:13:33.061]  Because they'd been brought here in the 80s and trained as a Republican Guard when Saddam was our ally.
[02:13:33.081 --> 02:13:35.243]  They were brought back in by Clinton and Bush Sr.
[02:13:35.583 --> 02:13:41.487]  They were involved in the bombing, and they were considering blaming it on Iraq at the time, but for some reason put it in the deep freeze.
[02:13:41.527 --> 02:13:48.633]  I said they're getting ready, from all the evidence I was seeing, to bring this back out and then claim an Arab militia nexus point with that.
[02:13:48.733 --> 02:13:50.854]  Now I've heard it on radio, seen it on TV.
[02:13:51.254 --> 02:13:53.156]  Now it's being brought out, but no one mentions, well...
[02:13:53.656 --> 02:13:57.605]  Well, why did the police arrest these Iraqis and were ordered by Clinton to release them?
[02:13:57.906 --> 02:14:01.935]  Why don't they show the surveillance camera tapes that FBI has said shows these Iraqis?
[02:14:02.155 --> 02:14:04.039]  Because they're globalist Iraqis!
[02:14:05.945 --> 02:14:09.206]  Yeah, and there's still thousands of them still in the country, I believe.
[02:14:09.466 --> 02:14:10.606]  We need to repost that.
[02:14:10.626 --> 02:14:17.608]  We need to take Pat Shannon's article, post above it our flashback, my article, and the old L.A.
[02:14:17.648 --> 02:14:20.509]  Times, Washington Post articles about bringing the Iraqis in.
[02:14:20.809 --> 02:14:23.289]  Because people just are confused by this poll still.
[02:14:23.529 --> 02:14:24.210]  Will you do that?
[02:14:25.210 --> 02:14:27.310]  Yeah, well, they rely on us not having memories.
[02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:28.791]  So, yeah, that's all we need to do.
[02:14:29.191 --> 02:14:31.251]  All right, John in Florida, you're on the air.
[02:14:31.311 --> 02:14:31.732]  Go ahead.
[02:14:32.352 --> 02:14:33.472]  Gentlemen, a good New Year.
[02:14:34.096 --> 02:14:34.516]  Thank you.
[02:14:35.677 --> 02:14:37.879]  Don't get to hear much of your programming, Alex.
[02:14:38.379 --> 02:15:01.077]  Maybe that somebody else called in and mentioned this to you, but it seems that the world-renowned psychic Sylvia Brown, who was a guest on George Norris' program about ten days ago or so, says that the Constitution will be amended such that Arnold can run and he will become president someday.
[02:15:01.644 --> 02:15:02.565]  Well, that isn't hard.
[02:15:02.605 --> 02:15:06.347]  I mean, that's like saying, I predict that the sun will come up in the morning.
[02:15:06.727 --> 02:15:07.648]  That's the plan.
[02:15:08.108 --> 02:15:08.689]  It's open.
[02:15:08.729 --> 02:15:10.670]  It's coming out in the new authorized biography.
[02:15:10.690 --> 02:15:12.051]  Schwarzenegger did the interview.
[02:15:12.251 --> 02:15:13.932]  Had anybody mentioned that to you before?
[02:15:14.753 --> 02:15:19.896]  No, but I mean, that's what some of these... I don't know this lady, but that's what a lot of psychics do.
[02:15:20.297 --> 02:15:22.498]  I'm not into it, but I know she's quite popular.
[02:15:22.618 --> 02:15:23.699]  Very, very renowned.
[02:15:24.824 --> 02:15:32.346]  Another issue in my mind, if I may, is this earthquake that hit on the 26th and the tsunami.
[02:15:33.067 --> 02:15:38.708]  Has anybody brought up the possibility that may have been an atomic bomb or something detonated?
[02:15:38.728 --> 02:15:40.029]  Yes, that's been raised.
[02:15:40.069 --> 02:15:40.789]  Thanks for the call.
[02:15:40.849 --> 02:15:41.889]  Paul, comments on that?
[02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:47.471]  Yeah, it's obvious that the experts there had foreknowledge of the earthquake.
[02:15:47.511 --> 02:15:49.351]  They knew the earthquake was going to happen.
[02:15:49.371 --> 02:15:50.872]  They didn't warn the right people.
[02:15:52.096 --> 02:16:10.301]  And then we had the article out of AFP back from 99, where I believe it was the US and Britain jointly with the Kiwis, New Zealand, who had developed this tsunami bomb as way back as 1944, which had the same impact as an atom bomb.
[02:16:10.561 --> 02:16:12.522]  So the technology has been in place.
[02:16:14.142 --> 02:16:19.604]  There's no real evidence so far to say that it was used in this instance, but we're keeping track of it.
[02:16:21.221 --> 02:16:22.382]  All right, well said.
[02:16:22.682 --> 02:16:25.123]  Let's talk to Sheila in Texas.
[02:16:25.143 --> 02:16:25.924]  Go ahead, Sheila.
[02:16:26.284 --> 02:16:26.844]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:27.645 --> 02:16:31.106]  I'm just calling because a very strange thing happened on the news last night.
[02:16:31.527 --> 02:16:33.808]  My husband and I, we live just north of Austin.
[02:16:34.408 --> 02:16:36.189]  We're watching the local news at 10 o'clock.
[02:16:36.709 --> 02:16:41.012]  There's this very quick blip on the news about a U.S.
[02:16:41.132 --> 02:16:43.233]  nuclear submarine running aground.
[02:16:43.333 --> 02:16:44.394]  Yeah, it ran aground, yeah.
[02:16:44.634 --> 02:16:46.655]  Well, how does that happen exactly?
[02:16:46.695 --> 02:16:47.835]  I mean, they're in the water.
[02:16:47.895 --> 02:16:48.756]  They have sonar.
[02:16:49.543 --> 02:16:50.244]  It was so fast.
[02:16:50.344 --> 02:16:52.025]  It was maybe 10, 15 seconds.
[02:16:52.085 --> 02:16:54.907]  And we sort of looked at each other and went, like, why isn't that headline news?
[02:16:55.207 --> 02:17:02.491]  Well, usually because there's some type of malfunction in the equipment, in the sonar, in the different sensors.
[02:17:03.312 --> 02:17:08.455]  And they do a lot of maneuvers down low, you know, down on the bottom and have problems.
[02:17:08.475 --> 02:17:09.976]  I mean, that's happened quite a bit.
[02:17:10.877 --> 02:17:14.479]  I just thought it was odd that it was not given more coverage because it seemed like
[02:17:15.880 --> 02:17:20.122]  The only point they made was, well, the nuclear part of it was not hurt in any way.
[02:17:20.142 --> 02:17:20.762]  There was no risk.
[02:17:20.862 --> 02:17:22.383]  Just curious.
[02:17:22.783 --> 02:17:25.824]  I think they said four people were hurt, one person critically.
[02:17:26.044 --> 02:17:26.325]  Right.
[02:17:27.265 --> 02:17:27.825]  Okay, thanks.
[02:17:28.245 --> 02:17:28.766]  Thank you.
[02:17:28.786 --> 02:17:31.487]  We'll get Paul's comment on that when we get back.
[02:17:31.507 --> 02:17:35.168]  And then we'll also talk to Jerry and others.
[02:17:35.188 --> 02:17:36.969]  But then we're going to plunge into the news.
[02:17:36.989 --> 02:17:40.170]  We're going to talk about the feds paying off the media.
[02:17:40.771 --> 02:17:43.532]  This Armstrong-Williams is a great window into that world.
[02:17:46.408 --> 02:17:47.909]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:17:47.969 --> 02:17:50.371]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[02:17:50.731 --> 02:17:51.612]  Let me rephrase that.
[02:17:51.972 --> 02:17:53.193]  Oil War III has started.
[02:17:53.513 --> 02:17:55.955]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[02:17:56.355 --> 02:17:59.757]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[02:18:00.178 --> 02:18:04.000]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:05.521]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[02:18:05.982 --> 02:18:10.465]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[02:18:10.885 --> 02:18:14.848]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[02:18:15.388 --> 02:18:21.290]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.

[02:18:46.758 --> 02:18:50.459]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:57.121]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:57.201 --> 02:18:59.042]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[02:18:59.662 --> 02:19:05.283]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:19:14.989 --> 02:19:20.610]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[02:19:21.211 --> 02:19:24.251]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:19:45.467 --> 02:19:47.088]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:19:47.228 --> 02:19:51.331]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:19:51.471 --> 02:19:54.333]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:19:54.433 --> 02:20:01.138]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:20:01.338 --> 02:20:04.340]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:20:04.540 --> 02:20:06.941]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:20:07.062 --> 02:20:15.167]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as apt

[02:21:54.739 --> 02:21:59.102]  According to callers meeting the press this weekend, they had somebody up there going, it's inevitable.
[02:22:00.162 --> 02:22:01.523]  Arnold will be your president.
[02:22:02.564 --> 02:22:07.867]  You know, they've got the psychics on the radio saying it's inevitable, and the media saying it's inevitable.
[02:22:09.368 --> 02:22:09.868]  Think about it.
[02:22:10.349 --> 02:22:12.390]  And Republicans will vote for him in a minute.
[02:22:13.391 --> 02:22:17.253]  There's been this big debate over, well, he's pro-abortion, anti-gun.
[02:22:18.434 --> 02:22:19.194]  Open border.
[02:22:19.314 --> 02:22:21.295]  I mean, conservatives, he wouldn't win a primary.
[02:22:21.335 --> 02:22:21.936]  Yes, he would.
[02:22:22.688 --> 02:22:26.890]  Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity endorsed him for governor over conservatives.
[02:22:28.191 --> 02:22:30.612]  And so they'll endorse him again, and they'll go, I don't care.
[02:22:32.053 --> 02:22:33.714]  Alex, you're for the Second Amendment.
[02:22:33.734 --> 02:22:34.394]  You're a liberal.
[02:22:34.434 --> 02:22:35.055]  I like Arnold.
[02:22:35.095 --> 02:22:35.895]  He wants to ban him.
[02:22:36.435 --> 02:22:37.436]  Okay, fine.
[02:22:38.156 --> 02:22:42.479]  Have a foreigner who says he wants to be a dictator as your president.
[02:22:43.199 --> 02:22:47.601]  And they're lining him up for president just as sure as... I don't want to spend all day on that.
[02:22:48.082 --> 02:22:50.403]  Again, ArnoldExposed.com is still updated daily.
[02:22:50.443 --> 02:22:51.344]  We're going to run those ads.
[02:22:51.384 --> 02:22:52.084]  We're producing them.
[02:22:53.041 --> 02:22:56.923]  Taking longer than I thought, and we're going to air him out in California, and thanks for spreading the word.
[02:22:57.263 --> 02:22:59.444]  Paul Watson, let's cover news, and we'll go to calls later.
[02:23:00.445 --> 02:23:06.668]  There is so much to cover here, but first off, let's get into this shadow government bill.
[02:23:06.688 --> 02:23:12.531]  A few years ago, they admitted that there was, quote, a shadow government running things, but now they've passed some legislation.
[02:23:14.133 --> 02:23:41.208]  Yes, out of the Boston Herald, and it states that basically under a cloak of secrecy, Congress has passed what they're calling a doomsday bill, whereby if a significant number of members of Congress are incapacitated by a terrorist attack, a natural disaster, or anything of that nature, they're going to hand over all legislative authority to, it said, a dozen or less lawmakers,
[02:23:42.270 --> 02:23:48.692]  And in the article, even the Commission on Continuity of Government were not even involved in the bill.
[02:23:49.232 --> 02:23:59.555]  And they're calling it unconstitutional, as is Congressman Byrd, who stated that the bill, quote, would allow less than a dozen people to declare war on another nation.
[02:24:00.515 --> 02:24:02.556]  Well, I mean, this is really the object.
[02:24:02.576 --> 02:24:09.158]  The corporate whores that run Congress are really asking for it if they sign over the rest of their authority.
[02:24:12.139 --> 02:24:18.084]  Well, we had reports over two years ago where the infrastructure had already been set up.
[02:24:18.264 --> 02:24:19.065]  They've already set up?
[02:24:19.125 --> 02:24:20.386]  Yeah, the other capital, yes.
[02:24:21.327 --> 02:24:38.042]  Yeah, with these secret bunkers built where not just prominent government officials would be, but also where it said CEOs, I think this was Newsweek, CEOs of major corporations would be hooked up to these secret teleconference channels whereby...
[02:24:38.981 --> 02:24:45.443]  They would jointly have total authority over lawmaking and martial law provisions in the event of a disaster.
[02:24:46.243 --> 02:24:54.506]  So, I mean, the groundwork is already in place for the rapid takeover of America by this secret government in any case of disaster.
[02:24:54.766 --> 02:25:02.968]  Well, it's like on 9-11, Arnold's buddy Warren Buffett met with all the top CEOs, dozens of which weren't in the towers that day but had their offices there.
[02:25:03.780 --> 02:25:06.122]  Well, yeah, which shows you that they've had the facilities in place before 9-11 to do that.
[02:25:20.484 --> 02:25:22.745]  See, people ask, how are they going to put Arnold in as president?
[02:25:22.805 --> 02:25:25.326]  People ask, how are they going to do all the stuff nobody wants?
[02:25:25.807 --> 02:25:37.372]  This is how, folks, they use terror to set up a dictatorship that have staged fake elections with electronic voting machines, and for some reason the establishment wants Schwarzenegger.
[02:25:37.392 --> 02:25:37.772]  Go ahead.
[02:25:39.993 --> 02:25:45.616]  Well, yeah, with this bill, I mean, they've basically absolved themselves as if they already had.
[02:25:46.311 --> 02:25:58.013]  Well, Haddon, of any loyalty to the people of the United States and the Constitution, this is how they're going to direct the policy of the country in the aftermath of this catastrophic attack, which they're all calling for, basically.
[02:25:59.454 --> 02:26:01.874]  It's going to get bigger, not a question of if but when.
[02:26:01.954 --> 02:26:03.835]  The country will permanently be unregulated.
[02:26:03.855 --> 02:26:04.755]  You'll have no freedoms.
[02:26:05.195 --> 02:26:07.375]  There'll be work brigades set up domestically.
[02:26:07.395 --> 02:26:08.536]  You'll all work for the government.
[02:26:09.216 --> 02:26:11.996]  And we're going to have to put millions of people in facilities.
[02:26:12.076 --> 02:26:14.737]  But, you know, this is for America, Paul.
[02:26:16.778 --> 02:26:27.606]  Well, I mean, it doesn't even have to be catastrophic in this instance because, you know, if they just release anthrax within Congress, then that would incapacitate, that would, you know, lock down Congress.
[02:26:27.646 --> 02:26:30.428]  That's happened just before the passage of the Patriarchs.
[02:26:30.488 --> 02:26:37.614]  They probably wouldn't even need a massive attack, although they might need that for the gas mileage to get the police state rolling.
[02:26:38.614 --> 02:26:41.757]  But even so, even an anthrax attack would probably get most of this done.
[02:26:43.275 --> 02:26:46.457]  And the last anthrax attack led right back to our friends.
[02:26:46.497 --> 02:26:52.960]  We even had a congressional bill that funded the study of how to mail anthrax to the mail in 1999.
[02:26:54.820 --> 02:26:56.161]  Yeah, Fort Detrick.
[02:26:56.801 --> 02:26:59.903]  And the people collared for that were completely innocent, like Hatfield.
[02:26:59.943 --> 02:27:03.204]  They were just the scapegoats, the patsies, to try and bury the story.
[02:27:03.244 --> 02:27:04.125]  That's the incredible part.
[02:27:04.185 --> 02:27:06.526]  Fort Detrick's doing drills of sending anthrax letters.
[02:27:07.282 --> 02:27:17.050]  And then the BATF's doing drills of rider trucks full of ammonium nitrate blowing up months before, and the very guy who's there blowing the trucks up in New Mexico is there that morning.
[02:27:18.171 --> 02:27:21.614]  And it's the first report... The CIA is doing drills of flying planes into buildings.
[02:27:22.175 --> 02:27:23.956]  Just, you know, it's magic, Paul.
[02:27:24.036 --> 02:27:24.997]  It's just accidental.
[02:27:25.798 --> 02:27:29.341]  I think they do these drills on purpose so if they get caught, they say it's a drill.
[02:27:29.741 --> 02:27:32.684]  It's like Putin's people got caught about to bomb a fourth building.
[02:27:33.124 --> 02:27:34.285]  In 99, they said it's a drill.
[02:27:35.578 --> 02:27:36.461]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.962 --> 02:27:38.586]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.489 --> 02:27:42.196]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.194 --> 02:27:48.576]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:27:48.816 --> 02:27:49.156]  Why?
[02:27:49.496 --> 02:27:52.117]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[02:28:44.890 --> 02:28:53.155]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:53.416 --> 02:28:57.778]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.059 --> 02:29:06.984]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.185 --> 02:29:10.807]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.087 --> 02:29:16.131]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:16.431 --> 02:29:23.156]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:29:23.636 --> 02:29:24.177]  What about you?
[02:29:24.933 --> 02:29:30.294]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:29:33.575 --> 02:29:36.196]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[02:29:48.985 --> 02:29:52.467]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[02:29:53.088 --> 02:29:56.610]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days.
[02:29:57.291 --> 02:29:59.892]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[02:30:00.333 --> 02:30:02.734]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[02:30:03.235 --> 02:30:04.656]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[02:30:05.376 --> 02:30:07.077]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[02:30:07.618 --> 02:30:08.578]  Check with your doctor.
[02:30:08.698 --> 02:30:13.601]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[02:30:14.062 --> 02:30:18.785]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[02:30:19.412 --> 02:30:20.253]  Light up your life.
[02:30:20.353 --> 02:30:23.075]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with the Northern Light.
[02:30:23.615 --> 02:30:38.306]  Call Northern Light Technologies at 800-263-0066 and speak to one of our trained representatives or visit us at northernlighttechnologies.com That's northernlighttechnologies.com Our phone number again is 800-263-0066
[02:31:03.849 --> 02:31:08.574]  A lot of people want to deny what's happening.
[02:31:09.915 --> 02:31:13.338]  A lot of people don't want to face the reality of what the New World Order is.
[02:31:13.358 --> 02:31:16.841]  They think if you just deny it, it goes away.
[02:31:16.941 --> 02:31:18.523]  Well, it doesn't, boys and girls.
[02:31:19.750 --> 02:31:27.577]  And so many people have their education paid for by the government, or so many people have power through the government that they just don't want to believe it.
[02:31:27.617 --> 02:31:28.878]  Well, I make this government up.
[02:31:28.918 --> 02:31:29.979]  Well, it's done good things for me.
[02:31:30.220 --> 02:31:31.361]  Well, it can't be bad.
[02:31:32.462 --> 02:31:40.950]  It's funny, I read some of the Roman accounts by the historians, how they'd come and kill the men, the fathers, in front of their five-year-old children.
[02:31:40.970 --> 02:31:44.493]  And they'd take the little boys and little girls...
[02:31:45.669 --> 02:31:46.350]  From Germany.
[02:31:46.670 --> 02:31:48.031]  What was the Visigoth kingdoms?
[02:31:48.111 --> 02:31:48.652]  Or Gaul.
[02:31:48.692 --> 02:31:49.833]  What is France today?
[02:31:51.374 --> 02:31:53.917]  And they would take them to Rome.
[02:31:54.137 --> 02:31:57.160]  And by the time they were 15 years old, they loved Rome.
[02:31:57.560 --> 02:31:59.602]  They served the king in many cases.
[02:31:59.962 --> 02:32:03.686]  His inner guard, his inner praetorian were almost all Visigothian.
[02:32:03.706 --> 02:32:05.808]  Of a Visigothic nature.
[02:32:07.349 --> 02:32:08.230]  Vandal nature.
[02:32:09.651 --> 02:32:11.272]  And they just didn't care.
[02:32:11.332 --> 02:32:15.913]  They had the memory of their father being killed, but by the time they were brainwashed, you know, well, Rome gave me everything.
[02:32:18.273 --> 02:32:19.154]  Well, I'm a Roman.
[02:32:20.574 --> 02:32:23.415]  And so, of course, the empire does things for you.
[02:32:23.455 --> 02:32:25.695]  You know, the mafia does too.
[02:32:26.256 --> 02:32:28.176]  You want to be a kept slave?
[02:32:28.436 --> 02:32:31.477]  You want your name on all the things this evil empire does?
[02:32:31.497 --> 02:32:34.938]  Because when you're signed on to this sucker, you're signed on to all of it.
[02:32:35.178 --> 02:32:38.699]  And man, I don't want that on my soul, on my immortal soul.
[02:32:42.853 --> 02:32:45.516]  Paul Watson, any comments on that little rant?
[02:32:46.798 --> 02:32:47.258]  Well, yeah.
[02:32:47.739 --> 02:32:50.843]  People who get a taste of it and think they're part of the power structure.
[02:32:50.863 --> 02:33:00.975]  I mean, for example, the people in my country who have been through higher education and they're talking to these professors every day in these institutes of academia.
[02:33:01.713 --> 02:33:06.577]  You talk to those people and they're the most closed-minded people you could possibly talk to.
[02:33:06.697 --> 02:33:10.360]  They're even more ignorant than somebody who doesn't know anything about anything.
[02:33:10.961 --> 02:33:19.468]  So it's brainwashed out of them to question authority because they think that they're part of it and they're told that you will be rewarded if you tell the company line.
[02:33:19.488 --> 02:33:21.970]  And so they get more and more closed-minded.
[02:33:22.531 --> 02:33:23.491]  And that's how it works.
[02:33:23.531 --> 02:33:25.573]  That's how people sell their souls into this.
[02:33:25.673 --> 02:33:28.876]  So, I mean, it's just a temptation which they can't refuse.
[02:33:29.972 --> 02:33:35.114]  And you know the music, the culture, the way it's sold to us with entertainment is powerful.
[02:33:35.634 --> 02:33:36.315]  It's popular.
[02:33:37.135 --> 02:33:40.256]  You know, I think a lot of heavy metal music is very destructive.
[02:33:42.077 --> 02:33:44.878]  Some of it has actually a good political message.
[02:33:44.898 --> 02:33:51.061]  A few of the groups out there, but last night I went out to get something to eat and stuff and they had some heavy metal on.
[02:33:51.081 --> 02:33:53.022]  And man, it was like I was back to being 14!
[02:33:54.594 --> 02:33:56.095]  And I was like singing along with it.
[02:33:56.115 --> 02:33:59.737]  I mean, you know, it's easy to get sucked into this stuff.
[02:34:00.277 --> 02:34:06.141]  You know, before I knew it, I was like, you know, singing along with the hymns.
[02:34:07.601 --> 02:34:08.822]  It's not good, folks.
[02:34:09.202 --> 02:34:12.164]  So, I mean, you know, even I lower my guard for a second.
[02:34:14.165 --> 02:34:14.785]  Well, me too.
[02:34:14.845 --> 02:34:20.889]  I mean, I found myself watching adverts and suddenly snapping out of it and realizing that I was in a complete daze.
[02:34:21.758 --> 02:34:32.283]  Well, I mean, the heavy metal music and all that kind of culture is basically designed to make people think that they can't have a difference, not only on their country or their system of government, but on their own life.
[02:34:32.483 --> 02:34:35.485]  Listen, I've heard Marilyn Manson is elevator music.
[02:34:37.085 --> 02:34:41.388]  And when Marilyn Manson is elevator music, folks, I mean, what comes after that?
[02:34:45.069 --> 02:34:46.030]  It's crazy.
[02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:49.371]  All right, let's cover some news, and we're going to go to Jerry and Steve and Jim.
[02:34:49.391 --> 02:34:50.292]  That's going to be it for calls.
[02:34:51.061 --> 02:34:53.662]  Before we go any further, let's talk about Armstrong Williams.
[02:34:53.822 --> 02:34:57.762]  I mean, this is a small little window into the payoffs that are going on.
[02:34:57.782 --> 02:34:58.703]  Tell us about it.
[02:34:58.723 --> 02:35:09.505]  Well, yeah, this is the commentator paid by the Bush administration who now admits his error to promote... But he's not giving back the $240,000.
[02:35:10.025 --> 02:35:19.527]  And the error isn't Bush paying him off with his money to go act like he's for Bill Clinton's UNESCO No Child Left Independent bill.
[02:35:21.016 --> 02:35:22.397]  No, they've shifted the focus.
[02:35:23.278 --> 02:35:33.586]  But I mean, even a bigger example here in the UK was back in 2002, 99% of parents were against the triple jab MMR vaccine.
[02:35:33.646 --> 02:35:40.992]  The British government came out immediately after and said, we're going to initiate a PR campaign to change people's minds.
[02:35:41.718 --> 02:35:49.765]  Lo and behold, a few months later, all these news reports started emerging about how good the triple jab MMR vaccine was and how it didn't.
[02:35:49.845 --> 02:35:50.886]  Same thing here.
[02:35:52.446 --> 02:35:56.329]  I mean, it's like I'm selling Schwarzenegger on us.
[02:35:56.910 --> 02:36:00.713]  I have no doubt that probably somewhere the RNC has already put cash in.
[02:36:01.053 --> 02:36:05.217]  I mean, it's just everywhere, every show, every channel, how great it is, 24-7.
[02:36:06.017 --> 02:36:14.304]  But let's go back to this example from a year ago of the $70-plus million for fake newscasts where he's our great leader.
[02:36:14.644 --> 02:36:15.805]  That's totally illegal.
[02:36:16.025 --> 02:36:19.688]  The Congressional Budget Office told Bush it was illegal, and he said, I'm not going to stop.
[02:36:19.909 --> 02:36:21.230]  But that's one buy...
[02:36:21.830 --> 02:36:24.817]  For one initiative to get the prescription drug thing passed, Paul.
[02:36:26.501 --> 02:36:27.684]  Yeah, that was Medicare.
[02:36:28.346 --> 02:36:30.992]  It was eventually denounced as covert propaganda.
[02:36:31.915 --> 02:36:33.736]  Well, I saw one of them and it was like...
[02:36:54.290 --> 02:37:07.557]  George Bush was really appreciated by a crowd who loved his plan, and then it came out later that in the very production I saw, again, he's going to the infomercial hour, they're paying the station, but it doesn't say it's an infomercial.
[02:37:07.857 --> 02:37:12.519]  It says it's a news agency, and it turned out Bush wasn't being clapped like that.
[02:37:12.559 --> 02:37:14.180]  They were cutting in crowds.
[02:37:16.701 --> 02:37:19.903]  Man, folks, that just... No, go ahead.
[02:37:20.751 --> 02:37:29.042]  They have them here in the UK, but they're gracious enough to label them party political broadcasts before they put them on, but it's the same thing.
[02:37:29.442 --> 02:37:36.652]  So they're just disguising it within the news rather than in this country where they have them immediately after the news, so there's not much difference anyway.
[02:37:38.473 --> 02:37:51.477]  I mean, folks, when they go out and are paying commentators a quarter mil, or $10,000 short of a quarter mil, to go out and promote the No Child Left Behind, by the way, that was to sell conservatives, see?
[02:37:51.737 --> 02:37:54.378]  Remember Bill Clinton was trying it, and he was so evil, but Bush does it?
[02:37:54.638 --> 02:37:56.999]  Oh, but the conservative leaders are for it!
[02:37:57.819 --> 02:38:01.241]  Again, how is Limbaugh paid more than his show brings in?
[02:38:05.174 --> 02:38:06.735]  You know, how does any of this happen?
[02:38:06.975 --> 02:38:09.055]  It's just so ridiculous.
[02:38:10.656 --> 02:38:11.156]  Oh, boy.
[02:38:11.316 --> 02:38:14.877]  All right, let's shift gears here.
[02:38:14.897 --> 02:38:18.578]  85-year-old man beaten, pepper sprayed by police, CNN.
[02:38:19.519 --> 02:38:24.640]  And police are there investigating an incident in which an officer pepper sprayed an 85-year-old man during a traffic stop.
[02:38:25.481 --> 02:38:31.002]  And it's Leon Nins, World War II, highly decorated veteran, who's 5'7", weighs 145 pounds.
[02:38:34.100 --> 02:38:38.461]  Didn't see the police car flashing its lights for a half mile!
[02:38:39.141 --> 02:38:42.502]  Man, I've been going down the road before and it takes me a quarter mile to stop if I get pulled over.
[02:38:43.083 --> 02:38:51.285]  And it's admitted, the cop slammed his legs in the door, beat him, tasered him, and began screaming and cussing at him.
[02:38:55.606 --> 02:39:02.928]  And now they're charging him, the old World War II vet, for not stopping fast enough, Paul comments.
[02:39:04.804 --> 02:39:07.348]  Well, yeah, they seem to pick on the most vulnerable people.
[02:39:08.850 --> 02:39:15.019]  Tasering people in wheelchairs, beating pregnant women for talking too loudly on the cell phone.
[02:39:15.760 --> 02:39:20.107]  It's amazing how they target the weak and those who can't defend themselves in the first place.
[02:39:21.994 --> 02:39:29.720]  As you've said many times, the people who are doing the same kind of thing now in Iraq are going to come back to America and become police officers and do the same thing.
[02:39:29.780 --> 02:39:43.110]  So it's just another example of how they view us as the enemy, as all their training dictates that the American people are now not their masters, not those who they're supposed to serve and protect, but the enemy.
[02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:50.636]  Well, I would say from just my own view of it, from my own monitoring it, observing it,
[02:39:51.678 --> 02:39:59.101]  Half the police are good, a quarter are in between, and a quarter are just bad, bad, bad.
[02:39:59.441 --> 02:40:05.463]  And I would agree, the thugs that like to do this, predators, instinctively attack weak people.
[02:40:05.744 --> 02:40:14.427]  And tasering five-year-olds now, tasering 95-year-old women, it's getting out of control, Paul.
[02:40:15.925 --> 02:40:18.446]  Well, come on, that five-year-old did have a piece of glass.
[02:40:18.726 --> 02:40:19.826]  No, no, that was the six-year-old.
[02:40:19.846 --> 02:40:24.048]  There was another five-year-old that ran from police.
[02:40:26.269 --> 02:40:36.212]  Yeah, that was the girl who ran across the highway, so they thought the best thing to do would be to, you know, taser her in the middle of the road, which seemed like a good idea at the time.
[02:40:36.992 --> 02:40:43.174]  But, I mean, again, some of these people who do these kind of things, then they're just allowed straight back into the force.
[02:40:43.214 --> 02:40:45.195]  It's like this sergeant in Iraq.
[02:40:46.112 --> 02:40:57.557]  Who wasn't even discharged from the army for ordering these two Iraqis to be thrown off the bridge into the Tigris River, killing one of them.
[02:40:58.177 --> 02:41:03.819]  And the cardinal sin that they'd committed was breaking the 9pm curfew time, again part of the liberation.
[02:41:04.900 --> 02:41:08.401]  So I mean, as in Iraq, it's starting to become the same thing in America.
[02:41:08.441 --> 02:41:10.002]  They're treating us as subhuman.
[02:41:10.562 --> 02:41:12.943]  That's what they're doing in Iraq, which is, you know, why...
[02:41:13.675 --> 02:41:23.464]  Well, I've got the article here where in the Masonic ritual last year where they blew the guy's head off, he got five years probation, no jail time.
[02:41:25.666 --> 02:41:30.090]  Yeah, and this sergeant gets six months for basically manslaughter.
[02:41:31.585 --> 02:41:39.649]  So, I mean, they do this so brazenly because there's never any kind of backlash against it, and they think it's okay because they treat people as subhumans.
[02:41:39.669 --> 02:41:42.990]  So if people are animals, then it's okay to treat them as animals in their view.
[02:41:43.251 --> 02:41:44.791]  I want to quickly go over these articles.
[02:41:44.891 --> 02:41:49.513]  London Telegraph, antidepressant drugs make breast cancer treatments less effective.
[02:41:50.254 --> 02:41:59.058]  Thousands of breast cancer patients who take Prozac and other drugs that counter depression are being warned that the treatment can make their anti-tumor medication less effective.
[02:42:00.470 --> 02:42:16.458]  A study by Doctors for American Hospitals in America has shown that Prozac and Cerarat both react negatively with Tamoxifen, the drug which is given to women to prevent the reoccurrence of breast cancer and prevent it working to its full capacity.
[02:42:16.478 --> 02:42:20.179]  Of course, it came out last week that it causes massive birth defects, but they're not stopping.
[02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:21.140]  Here's another one.
[02:42:22.503 --> 02:42:28.286]  Eli Lilly knew Prozac had a 1,200 higher suicide rate than other antidepressants.
[02:42:28.906 --> 02:42:34.229]  It's yet another example of the widespread negligent actions committed by Big Pharma in the quest for profits.
[02:42:34.269 --> 02:42:37.011]  It's not just Vioxx and Celebrex.
[02:42:37.031 --> 02:42:40.712]  Now the truth is finally starting to come out on antidepressant drugs like Prozac.
[02:42:41.073 --> 02:42:41.893]  And what is the truth?
[02:42:41.953 --> 02:42:43.554]  The drug makers Eli Lilly will not...
[02:42:44.094 --> 02:42:52.221]  Only knew their star drugs were more dangerous than alternatives, but they actively sought to suppress the release of that information in order to protect profits.
[02:42:52.241 --> 02:42:53.822]  Yeah, I knew this ten years ago, Paul.
[02:42:55.604 --> 02:42:58.226]  Well, yeah, and this is what they want your kids on under New Freedom.
[02:42:59.167 --> 02:43:01.188]  And the fact is... But it's New Freedom, Paul.
[02:43:01.248 --> 02:43:01.909]  It's freedom.
[02:43:02.449 --> 02:43:04.111]  Well, it must be, if it's called that.
[02:43:05.212 --> 02:43:11.677]  And studies have shown... Does that mean if we started labeling cyanide pills as vitamin C, people wouldn't get sick from it?
[02:43:12.307 --> 02:43:13.007]  People wouldn't die?
[02:43:13.648 --> 02:43:18.170]  Well, the European Union's banning all the vitamin C, so that's what they could replace it with.
[02:43:18.810 --> 02:43:35.338]  They ban the vitamins which make you better and cure you and keep you healthy, and they push all this Prozac on you, when the studies in the past have shown that 50% of people given placebos recover just as quickly from depression as people given Prozac.
[02:43:35.379 --> 02:43:37.740]  It's actually 55%, yes.
[02:43:37.880 --> 02:43:40.241]  Even more than half do better with a sugar pill.
[02:43:41.292 --> 02:43:51.476]  And then all these horrible side effects which the companies know about and yet push the drugs anyway because they're in it for profit and they're in it to keep people ill so they can keep them dependent on the company.
[02:43:51.516 --> 02:43:54.137]  Well, then the children get sick and they put them on even more.
[02:43:54.917 --> 02:43:58.799]  And of course the spin is it just makes children commit suicide.
[02:43:58.839 --> 02:44:00.779]  No, it makes adults do it too.
[02:44:00.799 --> 02:44:02.180]  But it is worse in children.
[02:44:04.041 --> 02:44:06.822]  Padilla's lawyers charge him or free him, MSNBC...
[02:44:08.602 --> 02:44:11.644]  And they're saying, how dare you not charge him for three years?
[02:44:11.684 --> 02:44:12.565]  Well, here's the problem.
[02:44:12.845 --> 02:44:13.845]  Forget Padilla.
[02:44:14.366 --> 02:44:16.107]  What about Dr. Charles T. Sell?
[02:44:16.507 --> 02:44:19.549]  The Army dentist called in to examine the dead bodies at Waco.
[02:44:19.569 --> 02:44:20.470]  He says they killed them.
[02:44:21.070 --> 02:44:26.513]  And so he's been held for seven years in solitary confinement, being forced drugged and never charged.
[02:44:28.555 --> 02:44:30.576]  Well, this goes right back to...
[02:44:31.440 --> 02:44:40.845]  November 2001, where they created the enemy combatant designation and the parallel legal system, as they called it.
[02:44:41.406 --> 02:44:47.109]  And now, last week, they came out and said we're pushing ahead to imprison people indefinitely.
[02:44:47.149 --> 02:45:00.156]  They're paying $25 million apiece to set up internment camps in foreign countries to keep individuals who have no evidence against them but will not be released because they're still terrorist suspects.
[02:45:01.842 --> 02:45:06.004]  And Padilla is an example of that, where there was no evidence against him.
[02:45:06.024 --> 02:45:10.146]  It was basically a scare case engineered by John Ashcroft.
[02:45:10.666 --> 02:45:13.967]  And now they're keeping people indefinitely in internment camps.
[02:45:14.267 --> 02:45:17.929]  And now they don't even get a tribunal because they can't get the tribunals to sit.
[02:45:17.949 --> 02:45:19.589]  Their own officers are quitting in mass.
[02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:28.313]  No, and it's funny that in these cases of so-called Al-Qaeda operatives, like Khalid Mohammed and others,
[02:45:29.011 --> 02:45:36.995]  They actually call other affiliated so-called al-Qaeda members to be at the trial who are supposedly still alive, like Ramzi bin al-Shib.
[02:45:37.355 --> 02:45:37.955]  But the U.S.
[02:45:37.995 --> 02:45:48.681]  government doesn't allow them to be present because they've already killed them and they've covered it up or they haven't killed them and yet they've told the media that they have killed them.
[02:45:48.801 --> 02:45:52.803]  Or they've killed them four times and captured them nine times and then they're still bombing.
[02:45:53.663 --> 02:45:54.043]  Yes.
[02:45:54.063 --> 02:45:56.665]  But they never retract how many times they were killed or captured.
[02:45:56.685 --> 02:45:57.125]  It's just a...
[02:46:00.033 --> 02:46:06.695]  Paul, before we get a break and come back and take the call from Jerry and Steve and Jim, tell folks about PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:46:06.815 --> 02:46:08.916]  Quite a bit is going up in the next few days.
[02:46:10.096 --> 02:46:14.757]  We've got at least four new videos going up this week, maybe even five.
[02:46:14.817 --> 02:46:18.078]  We've got Alex's weekly report going up today.
[02:46:18.098 --> 02:46:24.340]  We've got the Dean Haglund interview, who was former star of The Lone Gunman, going up.
[02:46:24.500 --> 02:46:24.960]  We've got
[02:46:25.818 --> 02:46:34.525]  Um, Mohammed Atta and the Venice Flying Circus, a great movie by Daniel Hopsicker, going up this week.
[02:46:35.206 --> 02:46:45.615]  And of course, the original 9-1-1 pre-release video, which you put out, which most people haven't got because it was only available for a couple of months, but it's going up again this week.
[02:46:45.655 --> 02:46:50.679]  So, you know, at least four videos this week, audio interviews, um,
[02:46:51.693 --> 02:46:56.603]  And everything else, the special reports, my book, Order Out of Chaos, Alex's book, other e-books.
[02:46:57.425 --> 02:47:02.796]  So it's a great time to sign up because the content's only increasing week by week.
[02:47:04.495 --> 02:47:08.138]  All 11 of my films, dozens of other films have been authorized to post.
[02:47:08.538 --> 02:47:09.979]  It's just ridiculous.

[02:48:23.164 --> 02:48:25.446]  Jerry, Steve, Jim, and others, we'll just take those three.
[02:48:26.146 --> 02:48:28.308]  And we'll wrap up this Monday edition.
[02:48:28.348 --> 02:48:31.211]  We've covered about 60, 70 articles.
[02:48:31.271 --> 02:48:32.071]  I didn't get to all of them.
[02:48:32.091 --> 02:48:35.875]  There's a lot more on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:48:36.415 --> 02:48:38.016]  But seriously, take advantage of PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:48:45.152 --> 02:48:51.994]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[02:48:52.314 --> 02:48:53.695]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:53.875 --> 02:48:56.096]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.236 --> 02:48:58.336]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:58.597 --> 02:49:03.538]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:03.878 --> 02:49:07.920]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:09.921]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.001 --> 02:49:20.648]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.808 --> 02:49:22.710]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:22.910 --> 02:49:24.971]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today.
[02:49:25.211 --> 02:49:26.752]  And man the guns of the Infowars.

[02:50:02.786 --> 02:50:09.514]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:09.915 --> 02:50:21.709]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:22.169 --> 02:50:26.612]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:26.792 --> 02:50:29.253]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:33.876 --> 02:50:34.896]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:51:49.232 --> 02:51:50.794]  This show is documented.
[02:51:51.254 --> 02:51:53.997]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:54.457 --> 02:51:57.960]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:51:58.381 --> 02:52:02.545]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:52:03.025 --> 02:52:09.511]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire, the ring of fire.
[02:52:11.772 --> 02:52:13.533]  All right, final segment here.
[02:52:13.553 --> 02:52:16.633]  Let's go to Jerry in Pennsylvania.
[02:52:16.673 --> 02:52:17.473]  Jerry, go ahead.
[02:52:17.834 --> 02:52:23.775]  Yeah, concerning the Masonic murder, David Hackett Fisher was on TV, I guess it was several months ago.
[02:52:23.795 --> 02:52:34.897]  He did a new book on Washington, and he's probably one of the most renowned historical researchers and authors on colonial America, Paul Revere's ride and a few other books.
[02:52:35.537 --> 02:52:39.678]  And he has access to Paul Revere's personal papers, diaries, and so on,
[02:52:40.222 --> 02:52:49.787]  And that night of the 18th and 19th of April, when Paul Revere was stopped, a British officer stopped him and he said, Prave, tell me, what is your name?
[02:52:50.708 --> 02:52:51.928]  And he thought, that's odd.
[02:52:52.689 --> 02:52:54.350]  This is in Revere's own handwriting.
[02:52:54.730 --> 02:52:57.692]  He said, that's an odd term, even for 18th century language.
[02:52:57.752 --> 02:52:58.812]  And he always thought about it.
[02:52:59.413 --> 02:53:02.474]  He said, he is not a Freemason.
[02:53:02.534 --> 02:53:05.876]  But he happened to mention this casually to someone who was a Mason.
[02:53:06.516 --> 02:53:09.098]  And the guy says, you know, I think that's a Masonic term.
[02:53:09.517 --> 02:53:13.538]  Well, yeah, and that's what the rituals are, where they simulate killing members if they ever speak out.
[02:53:13.558 --> 02:53:19.320]  And this guy got shot in the head, and he's dead, but hey, most of the judges are Masons, so the guy that killed him gets a couple years probation.
[02:53:40.171 --> 02:53:44.133]  I mean, do I have a little bit, another 30 seconds or so?
[02:53:44.213 --> 02:53:44.794]  You do it now.
[02:53:45.094 --> 02:53:45.754]  Oh, okay.
[02:53:46.375 --> 02:53:51.117]  Right here in Allegheny County, talk about a seizure of power.
[02:53:52.378 --> 02:53:53.719]  We have Cheryl Wecht.
[02:53:53.839 --> 02:53:56.640]  She's our coroner, and he's a world-renowned coroner.
[02:53:56.761 --> 02:53:57.821]  Okay, tell me.
[02:53:58.141 --> 02:54:01.623]  Okay, he questions the police a lot of times if there's a police-related death.
[02:54:01.984 --> 02:54:02.724]  Okay, and what happened?
[02:54:03.235 --> 02:54:08.180]  And the district attorney is trying to stop him from conducting any investigations anymore.
[02:54:08.661 --> 02:54:09.201]  Classic.
[02:54:09.261 --> 02:54:10.002]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:10.022 --> 02:54:10.803]  Great point, sir.
[02:54:11.484 --> 02:54:13.045]  Let's talk to Steve in Ohio.
[02:54:13.566 --> 02:54:14.487]  Pop in any time, Paul.
[02:54:14.767 --> 02:54:15.428]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:54:15.548 --> 02:54:16.008]  How you doing?
[02:54:17.029 --> 02:54:18.911]  Alex, I taped Meet the Press yesterday.
[02:54:18.951 --> 02:54:20.973]  I'm going to erase it, but I have a clip.
[02:54:21.013 --> 02:54:24.757]  It's 30 seconds where he admits that there's more people than just Mr. Armstrong.
[02:54:24.777 --> 02:54:25.318]  Did you want to hear it?
[02:54:25.908 --> 02:54:27.510]  Yeah, did you also get the Arnold part?
[02:54:28.551 --> 02:54:29.011]  No, I didn't.
[02:54:29.051 --> 02:54:30.372]  I didn't find it, and I went through it.
[02:54:30.392 --> 02:54:31.113]  Let me play this clip.
[02:54:31.153 --> 02:54:32.374]  It's about 30 seconds, okay?
[02:54:32.514 --> 02:54:34.636]  This is admitting more payoffs.
[02:54:34.696 --> 02:54:35.417]  I want this tape.
[02:54:35.477 --> 02:54:35.957]  I want this tape.
[02:54:35.998 --> 02:54:37.038]  All right, let me play it for you.
[02:54:37.179 --> 02:54:37.539]  Here it is.
[02:54:38.059 --> 02:54:39.341]  So I let him down.
[02:54:39.381 --> 02:54:40.362]  I'm sorry, Armstrong.
[02:54:40.682 --> 02:54:42.404]  Listen, I'll tell you this.
[02:54:43.004 --> 02:54:43.765]  I'll bet.
[02:54:44.205 --> 02:54:52.991]  That there will be a great market for FOIA, Freedom of Information, request in the next couple weeks because I suspect Armstrong Williams is not alone.
[02:54:53.231 --> 02:54:54.813]  There have been other people who've been doing this.
[02:54:54.913 --> 02:54:56.494]  In fact, the Census Bureau has done this.
[02:54:56.814 --> 02:55:03.338]  The Department of Health and Human Services has done this in the past on Medicare and other issues.
[02:55:03.699 --> 02:55:05.080]  So they have gone to...
[02:55:06.232 --> 02:55:16.797]  Not just to journalists, but they've put out fake news releases, video news releases, that are misleading to the average person who believes that they are news reports.
[02:55:17.117 --> 02:55:24.340]  And I think that the lines are so blurred, we have to also take a step back and ask, you know, things like the lines... Great job, Steve.
[02:55:24.361 --> 02:55:25.281]  Will you send that to me?
[02:55:25.661 --> 02:55:26.221]  Yes, I will.
[02:55:26.241 --> 02:55:29.583]  But I just wanted to say, Alex, did you get the CNN clip I sent you?
[02:55:29.643 --> 02:55:29.983]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:30.243 --> 02:55:30.844]  Okay, thank you.
[02:55:31.164 --> 02:55:33.725]  If you want to just put that on a VHS or anything...
[02:55:34.198 --> 02:55:34.718]  You're awesome.
[02:55:34.758 --> 02:55:35.359]  God bless you.
[02:55:35.459 --> 02:55:35.759]  Bye-bye.
[02:55:36.059 --> 02:55:36.640]  You're wonderful.
[02:55:38.421 --> 02:55:39.121]  Jim in Boston.
[02:55:39.141 --> 02:55:39.622]  Last caller.
[02:55:39.642 --> 02:55:39.942]  Go ahead.
[02:55:40.662 --> 02:55:41.883]  This is Jim from Boston.
[02:55:42.243 --> 02:55:49.748]  Listen, I need to give you guys some heads up on what's... I don't know if you've both seen an article from the New York Times.
[02:55:50.188 --> 02:55:53.130]  There's something going on up here in Truro, Massachusetts.
[02:55:53.490 --> 02:55:55.372]  That's a town which is down near the Cape.
[02:55:55.812 --> 02:55:56.592]  Hey, what's going on?
[02:55:56.973 --> 02:56:01.355]  Okay, the sheriff, what he's done, this involved a cold case murder.
[02:56:01.836 --> 02:56:03.637]  And what he's doing is asking all men...
[02:56:04.093 --> 02:56:06.315]  To report to the police station for their DNA?
[02:56:06.676 --> 02:56:08.017]  Yeah, that happened in Louisiana.
[02:56:08.057 --> 02:56:08.577]  That's big.
[02:56:08.677 --> 02:56:10.019]  Email that to Paul, okay?
[02:56:10.039 --> 02:56:17.106]  Yeah, if I can get a chance to find what the date is, I'll... Okay, we're out of time.
[02:56:17.126 --> 02:56:18.027]  We're out of time.
[02:56:18.067 --> 02:56:18.667]  Thanks for calling.
[02:56:18.687 --> 02:56:19.828]  Call me back tomorrow about that.
[02:56:20.129 --> 02:56:21.510]  Paul, that's a big problem, isn't it?
[02:56:22.463 --> 02:56:24.867]  Yeah, the article was posted a couple of days ago.
[02:56:24.887 --> 02:56:27.372]  They just did a widespread sweep for everyone's DNA.
[02:56:27.432 --> 02:56:31.599]  They're introducing the same thing here in England, so it's another frontier of the police state.
[02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:32.701]  All right, thanks, Paul.
[02:56:32.721 --> 02:56:34.444]  See you back tonight, 9am, and I'm back tomorrow.
