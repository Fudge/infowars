[00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:09.211]  Big Brother.
[00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:10.912]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:12.712]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:13.372 --> 00:00:14.192]  You want answers?
[00:00:14.933 --> 00:00:15.853]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:16.873 --> 00:00:20.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:20.694 --> 00:00:24.775]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:35.456]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, as we start this Tuesday transmission against tyranny, the 17th day of May, 2005.
[00:00:35.576 --> 00:00:50.224]  Congressman Tom Tancredo will be joining us for about 30 minutes at the start of the next hour to talk about the order to stand down that was given to the Border Patrol in Arizona.
[00:00:51.104 --> 00:00:53.946]  And of course, he's the chairman of the Immigration Reform Caucus,
[00:00:54.796 --> 00:01:00.927]  And he'll be joining us to talk about that and many other border issues that affect our economy, our way of life.
[00:01:01.948 --> 00:01:05.855]  Then, 30 minutes into the next hour, for the balance of the broadcast,
[00:01:06.658 --> 00:01:16.604]  From the middle of the program until the summation of it, we will have Paul Joseph Watson, who joins us every couple of weeks, his report from the Prison Planet.
[00:01:16.644 --> 00:01:25.609]  He is the webmaster over at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv with just a massive news blitz and your phone calls.
[00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:29.051]  Well, it's finally happening.
[00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:34.814]  CBS News, Associated Press, USA Today,
[00:01:35.871 --> 00:01:43.980]  So many people are talking about the parallels between the Star Wars saga and the way our government operates and behaves.
[00:01:45.401 --> 00:01:57.815]  I've been pointing this out for years because it's a phenomenon that children understand the plot lines of Episode 1, 2, and now 3, but adults do not understand it.
[00:01:58.522 --> 00:02:05.490]  Just like a lot of adults don't understand why Hitler blew up his own Reichstag to blame it on his enemies to take over.
[00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.135]  Or why our own government blew up the main in Havana Harbor in 1898.
[00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:15.121]  Or why LBJ and his presidential tapes have now been released two years ago.
[00:02:16.732 --> 00:02:22.515]  Admitted in those tapes that they staged the attack in the Gulf of Tonkin on those ships.
[00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:24.596]  It never happened.
[00:02:25.116 --> 00:02:28.438]  And 58,000 Americans and over a million and a half Vietnamese died.
[00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:34.281]  The staged attack on the USS Liberty, the most decorated ship.
[00:02:34.301 --> 00:02:36.021]  9-11, all of these events.
[00:02:36.161 --> 00:02:43.565]  But the parallels in Episode 1, 2, and 3 mirror, I mean right down to the devil worship folks,
[00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.011]  The Bushes and the Globalists and what they're up to.
[00:02:48.151 --> 00:02:49.832]  And I started writing an article two days ago.
[00:02:49.852 --> 00:02:50.853]  I've never really had time.
[00:02:52.054 --> 00:02:53.635]  And I titled my article.
[00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:54.996]  It'll be done this afternoon.
[00:02:55.637 --> 00:02:56.978]  I'm going to read part of it today.
[00:02:57.038 --> 00:03:00.140]  And I titled it, Darth Vader and the New World Order.
[00:03:00.901 --> 00:03:05.645]  I guess patriotic minds think alike because I saw Chuck Baldwin's article this morning.
[00:03:06.565 --> 00:03:09.708]  I guess he was writing at the very same time I started writing a couple days ago.
[00:03:10.108 --> 00:03:13.811]  Darth Vader and George W. Bush, a common vision of empire.
[00:03:14.628 --> 00:03:22.052]  Well, mine is, Darth Vader and the New World Order, Star Wars Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith, Mirrors Reality.
[00:03:23.253 --> 00:03:27.816]  And because this will be one of the most promoted films ever, I should have written this weeks ago, I meant to.
[00:03:27.836 --> 00:03:29.777]  I've talked a lot about it on the show.
[00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:43.718]  I really need you guys, when I post this, this afternoon, to email it to everybody, to post it on message boards, to get it out to people, because a lot of young people that would never know about the New World Order will hungrily read this article.
[00:03:43.738 --> 00:03:45.579]  Now, my article is already five pages long.
[00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:55.241]  I should have kept it down to two, like others have done, but it's going to end up being about eight pages long, and it is pretty powerful.
[00:03:56.403 --> 00:03:58.905]  And the article is basically done.
[00:03:58.925 --> 00:04:03.649]  I've just got to add about 20 hyperlinks to it.
[00:04:05.591 --> 00:04:08.914]  Look at how much Star Wars influences our culture.
[00:04:09.094 --> 00:04:16.040]  I mean, Ronald Reagan at Bohemian Grove in 1979 said, we'll name the Strategic Defense Initiative Star Wars to promote it.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.041]  That's admitted.
[00:04:18.122 --> 00:04:19.583]  I just said hyperlink.
[00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:22.846]  You know, just so much of what's in our culture
[00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:25.525]  I mean, the government names programs after it.
[00:04:25.925 --> 00:04:29.808]  We're going to discuss why it's so powerful, why it's so archetypal.
[00:04:30.548 --> 00:04:31.689]  And of course, it's cheesy.
[00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:36.232]  But it speaks to a basic subconscious understanding.
[00:04:36.252 --> 00:04:37.392]  You search your feelings.
[00:04:37.452 --> 00:04:38.833]  You know it to be true.
[00:04:38.893 --> 00:04:41.995]  And yes, it's New Age and dangerous as well.
[00:04:42.035 --> 00:04:45.137]  But the point is, it's a phenomenon and it's got to be discussed.
[00:04:45.157 --> 00:04:47.298]  But there's a bunch of other news I'll cover as well.
[00:04:47.318 --> 00:04:49.019]  There's just so much coming up today.
[00:04:49.339 --> 00:04:50.600]  Two powerful guests.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.021]  Stay tuned.
[00:04:52.873 --> 00:04:57.321]  As we continue to fight the empire, ladies and gentlemen, that's already destroyed.
[00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.863]  The old republic.
[00:04:59.424 --> 00:05:00.186]  The dark time.
[00:05:00.246 --> 00:05:00.767]  The empire.
[00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:10.512]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:10.812 --> 00:05:12.193]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:12.374 --> 00:05:14.575]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:14.595 --> 00:05:16.837]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:17.097 --> 00:05:22.061]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:22.381 --> 00:05:26.404]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:28.446]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:28.506 --> 00:05:39.176]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:39.316 --> 00:05:41.218]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:41.418 --> 00:05:45.282]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns in the info war.
[00:05:45.382 --> 00:05:46.663]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:50.467 --> 00:05:52.429]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:57.473]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:05:57.713 --> 00:05:58.434]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.791]  Terrorism!
[00:06:03.931 --> 00:06:04.691]  Terrorism!
[00:06:04.791 --> 00:06:10.855]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:06:11.115 --> 00:06:15.438]  Alarming words for our time, but how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:30.388]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:30.428 --> 00:06:30.729]  government.
[00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:32.710]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:38.991]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:39.131 --> 00:06:43.652]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:43.892 --> 00:06:49.494]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:51.334]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.354 --> 00:06:53.294]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:04.950]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:09.033]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:10.174]  Read the labels.
[00:07:10.594 --> 00:07:14.736]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:14.956 --> 00:07:19.139]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:19.519 --> 00:07:24.382]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:24.762 --> 00:07:28.365]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:28.545 --> 00:07:33.889]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:34.149 --> 00:07:36.891]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:37.192 --> 00:07:38.092]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:38.393 --> 00:07:49.121]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[00:08:04.469 --> 00:08:10.071]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:14.613]  Alright, 8 minutes, 10 seconds into this first hour of transmission.
[00:08:15.134 --> 00:08:19.816]  Congressman Tom Tancredo to talk about Fort Bush ordering the Border Patrol to stand down.
[00:08:21.516 --> 00:08:32.641]  And of course, we'll have Paul Joseph Watson, 30 minutes into the next hour for the balance of the broadcast, to cover the news and blitzkrieg through all the important information, and take your calls.
[00:08:33.436 --> 00:08:49.105]  I'm going to get into forced sterilization by the hundreds of thousands in America, just to show you about past crimes of this government that went on until the mid-1980s, and frankly are still going on, but the massive program was in the mid-1980s, to show you how tyranny can go on right beneath your nose.
[00:08:50.763 --> 00:08:57.565]  Also, a lot of other news on the economy, on Newsweek supposedly retracting the Koran and the toilet story.
[00:08:57.845 --> 00:08:58.965]  Pure propaganda!
[00:08:59.485 --> 00:09:04.106]  I want to get more into that, but let me spend some time first on Star Wars.
[00:09:04.186 --> 00:09:07.567]  Now, again, I grew up in the 70s, and I like Star Wars.
[00:09:07.587 --> 00:09:10.448]  I mean, even when I was a child, I didn't like Return of the Jedi.
[00:09:10.468 --> 00:09:12.789]  Pretty cheesy with those Ewoks.
[00:09:13.669 --> 00:09:17.650]  And, you know, they told us at church that it was a new age and a cultic, and that's certainly true.
[00:09:18.547 --> 00:09:22.589]  And it resonates with people because deep down folks know that's what's really running things.
[00:09:23.129 --> 00:09:27.891]  There really is, you know, a dark group, a dark cult running things.
[00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:29.091]  The Order of Death.
[00:09:30.092 --> 00:09:34.193]  And, uh, Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, they believe in black magic.
[00:09:34.614 --> 00:09:36.334]  That's what our leaders are involved in.
[00:09:36.374 --> 00:09:43.077]  In my new film, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, martial law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, details that.
[00:09:44.145 --> 00:09:48.467]  We see the police dressed in these black helmets and black outfits and black armor.
[00:09:48.487 --> 00:09:49.747]  They look just like Darth Vader.
[00:09:50.027 --> 00:09:51.608]  They're using this for intimidation.
[00:09:51.868 --> 00:09:54.189]  Their own law enforcement handbooks admit this.
[00:09:55.669 --> 00:09:58.030]  There's just thousands of examples and parallels.
[00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:04.933]  And again, they named the Star Wars program, the Strategic Defense Initiative after it, at the Bohemian Grove.
[00:10:05.593 --> 00:10:07.974]  That's Reuters and the Washington Post.
[00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:16.492]  Back in the 80s, they said, oh, Reagan was at a camp out in Northern California at Bohemian Grove in 1979 as he was running for president.
[00:10:16.532 --> 00:10:18.473]  And they said, what are we going to name this program?
[00:10:18.513 --> 00:10:21.113]  As he talked to some of the heads of Lockheed Martin and others.
[00:10:21.133 --> 00:10:24.534]  And they said, Reagan said, how about Star Wars?
[00:10:26.535 --> 00:10:30.636]  That's how powerful this has been in our culture.
[00:10:32.464 --> 00:10:39.148]  And at the Cannes Film Festival a couple days ago, and this is in CBS News, Sith and Bytes Bush comparisons.
[00:10:39.649 --> 00:10:42.851]  Here's Japan today, Lucas jabs at Bush empire.
[00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:47.794]  We've got my own article, not even published yet because I'm not done adding hyperlinks.
[00:10:48.174 --> 00:10:50.115]  Darth Vader and the New World Order.
[00:10:50.856 --> 00:10:56.239]  Here is Chuck Baldwin's Darth Vader and George W. Bush, a common vision of empire.
[00:10:59.031 --> 00:11:04.174]  There are literally probably 50 of these articles I've seen in the last few days, but I've been talking about this for a long time.
[00:11:04.675 --> 00:11:09.317]  Several different important sociological or psychological phenomena.
[00:11:10.938 --> 00:11:21.285]  I go see a movie like The Incredibles, where Syndrome, the evil superhero, attacks the city with his robotic forces so he can be the hero and be worshipped and take over.
[00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:23.440]  Children understand the plot.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:24.481]  I've talked to many children.
[00:11:24.842 --> 00:11:25.882]  Oh yeah, he's a bad man.
[00:11:25.923 --> 00:11:27.504]  He wants to take over and for them to love him.
[00:11:27.784 --> 00:11:29.226]  So he attacks the city himself.
[00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:30.967]  Final Fantasy.
[00:11:31.007 --> 00:11:33.690]  The General wants to take over and go after the peaceniks.
[00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:36.993]  So he allows the enemy to break down the defenses in New York.
[00:11:37.793 --> 00:11:38.714]  So he can take over.
[00:11:40.015 --> 00:11:41.216]  In Star Wars.
[00:11:42.958 --> 00:11:43.899]  Revenge of the Sith.
[00:11:45.957 --> 00:11:55.683]  The Emperor becomes Chancellor and then gets dictatorial power by carrying out massive terror attacks through Count Dooku or Darth Tyrannus that he controls!
[00:11:57.024 --> 00:12:10.812]  And then you look at the real world, Gulf of Tonkin, USS Liberty, Oklahoma City, World Trade Center bombing 1 and 2, 93-2001, Hitler burning the Reichstag, Nero in Rome, the philosopher Hegel wrote about problem-reaction solution,
[00:12:12.549 --> 00:12:14.211]  We have government documents detailing this.
[00:12:14.231 --> 00:12:15.293]  I'm going to read my article later.
[00:12:15.313 --> 00:12:17.315]  I've only written about 80% of it.
[00:12:17.355 --> 00:12:19.818]  I've got to finish it and then put all the hyperlinks in this afternoon.
[00:12:19.858 --> 00:12:20.619]  It will be posted.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:28.930]  And please help us spread the word on this because it's a way to reach out to young people that will never get involved in fighting the New World Order and the real rebellion against it.
[00:12:29.764 --> 00:12:34.007]  But if we use this fiction to open their minds, it can be very powerful.
[00:12:34.527 --> 00:12:42.392]  And unfortunately, most of the people writing about this are talking about the parallels between Bush, and you're either with me or against me, and these imperial wars.
[00:12:43.232 --> 00:12:44.993]  And the government admits they are the new empire.
[00:12:45.454 --> 00:12:48.496]  The Naval War College, you know, Thomas Barnett, they're out there saying that.
[00:12:49.576 --> 00:12:50.357]  But instead,
[00:12:51.815 --> 00:12:55.398]  We need to, I need to write a note to put in my article about Thomas Barnett.
[00:12:55.458 --> 00:12:56.779]  I'm just putting so much in this article.
[00:12:57.239 --> 00:13:05.005]  We need to get this out on all the search engines, get it out on all the message boards, get it out to all the little news sites, so people can see this, especially the young people.
[00:13:05.805 --> 00:13:15.672]  So that's why I'm going to spend some time on this, because it's a very sophisticated thing that we're looking at here, and very, very important.
[00:13:16.153 --> 00:13:18.815]  And they're saying this third one's actually going to be good, unlike the last two.
[00:13:19.095 --> 00:13:20.616]  The plots are great, they are cheesy.
[00:13:21.481 --> 00:13:23.723]  But why can young people see it, but adults can't?
[00:13:23.763 --> 00:13:25.384]  Because adults have been engineered.
[00:13:25.724 --> 00:13:26.705]  They've been conditioned.
[00:13:27.585 --> 00:13:31.448]  That's why the globalists try to quote, get us while we're young, to dumb us down while we're young.
[00:13:31.748 --> 00:13:34.090]  We've got to unlock minds while people are young.
[00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:44.357]  You know, we tried to piggyback on Fahrenheit 9-11 to get the truth out to those people, but we're going to that, that it's a lot worse than what Michael Moore whitewashed, and you did that, it was very successful.
[00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:45.718]  Let's do that here!
[00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:47.559]  I've said,
[00:13:48.516 --> 00:13:51.918]  Upload, martial law to file serving networks, and name it!
[00:13:52.859 --> 00:13:58.061]  The Real Attack of the Sith, or Star Wars Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith.
[00:13:59.682 --> 00:14:06.666]  So then millions of people out looking on the net to download it, which it needs to be done today or tomorrow or it won't have the big effect.
[00:14:06.826 --> 00:14:08.707]  I think it may have already been done, I haven't searched or checked.
[00:14:09.108 --> 00:14:14.891]  Then millions will watch the film and get the real truth about the dark cult that's controlling things.
[00:14:16.627 --> 00:14:22.670]  But to kick off this next 30 minutes that I'm going to spend on Star Wars, about a month ago, a listener sent us this track.
[00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:24.131]  We aired it once last week.
[00:14:24.191 --> 00:14:26.492]  Here it is one more time for you.
[00:14:26.552 --> 00:14:32.255]  It's called Dark Side, and I think it puts it very well into the music and the spoken word.
[00:14:32.476 --> 00:14:33.096]  So here it is.
[00:14:36.183 --> 00:14:45.250]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:58.080]  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September 3rd.
[00:15:07.671 --> 00:15:08.452]  The Dark Side.
[00:15:52.456 --> 00:16:01.080]  New World Order is run by absolutely ruthless individuals.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.741]  Obsessed with total control.
[00:16:04.981 --> 00:16:16.366]  Sworn to the creation of a worldwide terror.
[00:16:16.646 --> 00:16:18.687]  Called the New World Order.
[00:16:23.124 --> 00:16:30.688]  The danger to our country is great.
[00:16:30.908 --> 00:16:36.191]  The danger to our country is growing.
[00:17:08.339 --> 00:17:12.543]  American forces are here to help you.
[00:17:12.563 --> 00:17:13.004]  Remain calm.
[00:17:13.024 --> 00:17:15.907]  We will not tolerate civil disobedience.
[00:17:15.927 --> 00:17:17.088]  I don't care who you are.
[00:17:17.188 --> 00:17:19.510]  I have no idea who you are.
[00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:22.794]  I will not forgive you for what you did last year.
[00:17:22.814 --> 00:17:25.457]  I promise I'll be small before you can go down the road.
[00:17:25.477 --> 00:17:26.017]  Step out of this.
[00:18:20.611 --> 00:18:21.772]  That is powerful.
[00:18:22.293 --> 00:18:23.193]  You've got to see this one.
[00:18:23.213 --> 00:18:31.821]  They put images of Hitler and Bush together with Back in Black, but it's a video so we can't really play it on the air because it doesn't have the impact.
[00:18:32.301 --> 00:18:35.724]  But that's in the audio track section of PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:35.744 --> 00:18:37.706]  We'll try to repost on the main page.
[00:18:37.726 --> 00:18:38.907]  I'm going to put that little audio
[00:18:39.897 --> 00:18:44.042]  You just heard that mix in this piece I'm writing that's getting longer and longer.
[00:18:44.122 --> 00:18:48.367]  But that'll be up this afternoon after this broadcast.
[00:18:49.288 --> 00:18:50.729]  Let's get into the news now.
[00:18:50.810 --> 00:19:00.841]  Lucas Jabs at Bush's Empire, the last episode of the sci-fi saga Star Wars, screened at the Cannes Film Festival Sunday.
[00:19:02.147 --> 00:19:08.869]  Completing a six-part series that remains a major part of popular culture and delivered a galactic jab at U.S.
[00:19:08.909 --> 00:19:09.969]  President George Bush.
[00:19:09.989 --> 00:19:22.572]  Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith was seen ahead of a celebrity-laden evening screening to be attended by its creator and director George Lucas and its cast including Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen.
[00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:29.314]  Reaction in advance screenings was effusive with festival goers
[00:19:30.234 --> 00:19:35.436]  Critics and journalists at Cannes applauding at the moment the infamous Darth Vader comes into being.
[00:19:35.496 --> 00:19:43.600]  But there were also murmurs at parallels that drawn between Bush's administration and the birth of the space operative evil empire.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:48.422]  And we'll tell you what George Lucas had to say when we get back.
[00:19:48.462 --> 00:19:56.486]  Then we'll get into my article and part of the article written by some of the other great folks that are out there.
[00:19:57.236 --> 00:19:59.877]  And then we'll get to your calls, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:00.317 --> 00:20:01.158]  Chuck Baldwin's article.
[00:20:01.538 --> 00:20:02.318]  So we'll be right back.
[00:20:02.338 --> 00:20:03.058]  Stay with us.
[00:20:03.939 --> 00:20:08.541]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's Liquid Quell.
[00:20:08.781 --> 00:20:17.204]  Doctor-recommended, safe, effective, affordable cholesterol control, available now at major wholesale clubs everywhere, without a prescription.
[00:20:17.424 --> 00:20:19.125]  Here's Dr. Sherry Rainwater, M.D.
[00:20:19.745 --> 00:20:24.989]  I recommend Quell to my patients because it's been shown to be effective and safe in reducing cholesterol.
[00:20:25.149 --> 00:20:31.454]  Quell is an easy way to improve your cholesterol profile without serious side effects in as little as six months, guaranteed.
[00:20:31.734 --> 00:20:35.997]  And Quell is safe for diabetics, gluten-free, and safe to take with prescriptions.
[00:20:36.178 --> 00:20:37.839]  Here's Cheryl G. in California.
[00:20:38.059 --> 00:20:44.504]  Quell lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days, something I couldn't do with diet and exercise in two to three years.
[00:20:44.824 --> 00:20:51.386]  Gentle, fast-acting liquid Quell is available at major wholesale clubs nationwide and online at QuellDirect.com.
[00:20:51.526 --> 00:20:55.147]  Quell your cholesterol today, risk-free and guaranteed.
[00:20:55.628 --> 00:20:58.468]  These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.
[00:20:58.568 --> 00:21:01.789]  Quell is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.
[00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:03.170]  Individual results may vary.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.543]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:09.904 --> 00:21:14.007]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:14.287 --> 00:21:14.827]  We listened.
[00:21:15.147 --> 00:21:20.131]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:20.411 --> 00:21:20.892]  We listened.
[00:21:21.272 --> 00:21:24.314]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:24.734 --> 00:21:25.255]  We listened.
[00:21:25.715 --> 00:21:29.797]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:21:30.157 --> 00:21:30.658]  We listened.
[00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:36.240]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:38.001]  Again, we listened.
[00:21:38.381 --> 00:21:45.745]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[00:21:46.145 --> 00:21:50.447]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium
[00:21:53.934 --> 00:21:55.017]  That's toll free 808-803-4438.
[00:21:55.098 --> 00:21:56.301]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:03.908 --> 00:22:05.389]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[00:22:05.669 --> 00:22:10.273]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:22:10.614 --> 00:22:12.935]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:22:13.176 --> 00:22:14.697]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:22:15.077 --> 00:22:20.161]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:22:20.482 --> 00:22:21.703]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[00:22:21.763 --> 00:22:24.465]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:22:24.865 --> 00:22:31.573]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering a 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:22:32.254 --> 00:22:35.097]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:35.718 --> 00:22:38.441]  That's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:38.781 --> 00:22:43.887]  I can tell you there'll be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[00:22:44.407 --> 00:22:49.892]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your Red Book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[00:22:49.932 --> 00:22:51.954]  Get the map.
[00:22:51.994 --> 00:22:54.396]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[00:22:54.596 --> 00:22:55.597]  The time is now.
[00:22:55.937 --> 00:22:58.279]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:58.839 --> 00:23:01.962]  Get your Red Book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[00:23:04.551 --> 00:23:05.712]  All water isn't the same.
[00:23:05.973 --> 00:23:10.978]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[00:23:11.238 --> 00:23:13.841]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[00:23:14.042 --> 00:23:22.591]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[00:23:22.951 --> 00:23:31.395]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[00:23:31.515 --> 00:23:34.977]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[00:23:35.217 --> 00:23:42.660]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.941]  You've all heard about products that energize your water.
[00:23:45.021 --> 00:23:46.362]  Don't be fooled by imitators.
[00:23:46.482 --> 00:23:51.304]  Visit Aquanorthwest.com to learn more about the benefits of positively charged energy water.
[00:23:51.624 --> 00:23:54.646]  Call 888-7-AQUA-NW.
[00:23:54.806 --> 00:23:56.447]  That's 888-727-8269.
[00:23:56.587 --> 00:24:00.310]  Or visit Aquanorthwest.com.
[00:24:05.253 --> 00:24:12.357]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:12.758 --> 00:24:15.900]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:18.366 --> 00:24:22.569]  All right, the same thing is quoted by CBS News and Chuck Baldwin and many others.
[00:24:23.190 --> 00:24:24.251]  But here are the quotes.
[00:24:24.471 --> 00:24:26.032]  This is out of Japan Today.
[00:24:29.054 --> 00:24:35.419]  It says, Batty's dialogue about bloodshed and despicable acts being needed to bring peace and stability.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:42.645]  The torture, we'll keep it safe, for the movie's universe, mainly through a fabricated war, set the scene.
[00:24:43.085 --> 00:24:44.226]  And then came the zinger.
[00:24:44.884 --> 00:24:52.867]  With the protagonist Anakin Skywalker saying just before becoming Darth Vader, you're either with me or you are my enemy to Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[00:24:53.387 --> 00:25:06.673]  To the Cannes audience, often sympathetic to anti-Bush messages and cinema, as last year's triumph here of Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9-11 attested, many immediately recalled Bush's 2001 ultimatum, you're either with us
[00:25:08.090 --> 00:25:10.292]  Or against us in the fight against terror.
[00:25:10.512 --> 00:25:13.874]  And he also said you're either with us or with the terrorists.
[00:25:13.894 --> 00:25:14.955]  He said that about 20 times.
[00:25:15.295 --> 00:25:21.739]  Lucas, speaking to reporters, emphasized that the original Star Wars was written at the end of the Vietnam War, when Richard Nixon was U.S.
[00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:25.682]  President, but that the issue being explored was still very much alive today.
[00:25:26.508 --> 00:25:30.351]  The issue was, how does a democracy turn itself into a dictatorship, he said.
[00:25:30.731 --> 00:25:37.256]  When I wrote it, Iraq-US-led war didn't exist, but the parallels are what we did in Vietnam and Iraq are unbelievable.
[00:25:37.676 --> 00:25:43.441]  Acknowledge an uncomfortable feeling that the United States was in danger of losing its democratic ideals, like the movie.
[00:25:43.921 --> 00:25:46.903]  I don't think it was going to get this close, he said.
[00:25:47.083 --> 00:25:49.445]  I hope this doesn't come true in our country.
[00:25:50.914 --> 00:25:59.041]  Although he didn't mention Bush by name, Lucas took what sounded like another dig while explaining the transformation of the once good Anakin Skywalker to the very bad Darth Vader.
[00:25:59.421 --> 00:26:01.483]  Most people think they're good, he said.
[00:26:02.964 --> 00:26:04.045]  And it goes on.
[00:26:04.806 --> 00:26:08.809]  But I think what we need to do here is just read my article.
[00:26:08.909 --> 00:26:13.813]  And again, my article is not done yet, and I'm going to add a lot of stuff to it, and it'll be up
[00:26:14.557 --> 00:26:18.060]  About 3 o'clock, 3.30 after this live show today.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.964]  And I hope you'll go to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com or if you're a member of our Yahoo email group, you'll be getting it.
[00:26:24.284 --> 00:26:25.685]  And please distribute it widely.
[00:26:25.705 --> 00:26:26.666]  We don't have any power.
[00:26:27.067 --> 00:26:31.190]  It can't affect any change until you, the listener, takes action.
[00:26:31.870 --> 00:26:33.872]  And this is a great way to reach out to young people.
[00:26:33.932 --> 00:26:35.173]  I meant to do this weeks ago.
[00:26:35.633 --> 00:26:36.714]  I've just been so busy.
[00:26:38.250 --> 00:26:39.571]  Here is my article.
[00:26:39.712 --> 00:26:41.693]  Darth Vader and the New World Order.
[00:26:41.753 --> 00:26:45.096]  Star Wars Episode 3 Revenge of the Sith Mirrors Reality.
[00:26:45.657 --> 00:26:48.999]  And some of this will be repeats of what I just said earlier, but a lot of it's new.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.721]  At last!
[00:26:52.153 --> 00:26:53.774]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:26:53.954 --> 00:26:57.875]  The mainstream media is picking up on something we've been talking about for years.
[00:26:58.236 --> 00:27:05.399]  The plot lines of George Lucas' six Star Wars films mirror, in many respects, the activities of Western governments.
[00:27:05.899 --> 00:27:07.559]  The circle is now complete, I would add.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:18.244]  George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars Saga, has said over and over again that he simply plays on subconscious archetypal symbols that evoke primeval fears and passions.
[00:27:18.684 --> 00:27:25.647]  Lucas has also stated on many occasions that he draws from historical examples of imperial leaders' lust for war and total power.
[00:27:26.247 --> 00:27:34.490]  Lucas has said that, uh, said that is why his films have such a powerful effect on people deep down.
[00:27:34.971 --> 00:27:41.273]  Everyone knows that the greatest threat to life and liberty isn't the average criminal on the street.
[00:27:42.934 --> 00:27:48.036]  No, my friends, but the monolithic, all-powerful state.
[00:27:49.477 --> 00:27:55.801]  Continuing, the human desire to resist tyranny is one of the strongest drives we have, and he plays to that.
[00:27:57.101 --> 00:28:06.807]  While premiering his film Star Wars Revenge of the Sith at the Cannes Film Festival, Lucas was asked if his new film was a social commentary on George Bush and the Iraq War.
[00:28:08.648 --> 00:28:14.311]  And you know what Lucas said, and that's repeated here in the film.
[00:28:15.652 --> 00:28:16.993]  And repeated in the
[00:28:18.837 --> 00:28:23.828]  Article how he didn't think it would be this close to reality, but yes, it's scary that this mirrors reality
[00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:30.393]  There are thousands of examples of classical despotism being practiced in the U.S.
[00:28:30.693 --> 00:28:31.954]  and worldwide today.
[00:28:32.334 --> 00:28:33.855]  Here are just a couple of examples.
[00:28:33.935 --> 00:28:39.518]  Our new Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez, in published memos told the President and the military that U.S.
[00:28:39.678 --> 00:28:44.080]  forces could integrate detainees and interrogate them to death.
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:50.484]  If the detainees died while being pressured, the military's actions would be legal as long as they hadn't killed them on purpose.
[00:28:52.144 --> 00:28:53.225]  It's very important.
[00:28:54.435 --> 00:29:03.877]  The document contained examples of how to strap someone down to a table and lower them into liquid affluent until they began to pass out.
[00:29:05.078 --> 00:29:06.238]  Buckets of urine, folks.
[00:29:06.678 --> 00:29:19.001]  Gonzales had the nerve to say that President Bush is the law and that he can break any federal or international law that he wishes because he is the president.
[00:29:19.628 --> 00:29:29.598]  Gonzales openly defended his view in front of a Senate panel that still confirmed him to the post of Attorney General despite his admissions.
[00:29:29.718 --> 00:29:33.121]  Alberto Gonzales' dark views are shared by the rest of the White House.
[00:29:33.402 --> 00:29:37.425]  They believe that they are above the law, coupled with the exploding American police state.
[00:29:37.666 --> 00:29:40.909]  This is a textbook definition of dictatorship.
[00:29:42.288 --> 00:29:50.679]  Combine this open demonstration of dictatorship with 63 countries on the White House invasion hit list, and tyrannical empire is the only term that fits.
[00:29:51.199 --> 00:29:52.181]  Come back and read the rest.
[00:29:54.223 --> 00:29:57.227]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:58.148 --> 00:30:00.812]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:06.627 --> 00:30:10.689]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine, and I want to tell you about the Sacro Wedge.
[00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:13.651]  I don't endorse many products, but I'm endorsing this one.

[00:30:21.485 --> 00:30:29.567]  For more than 10 years now, the Sacro Wedgie has helped thousands find relief from the symptoms and pain of back problems.
[00:30:29.927 --> 00:30:31.827]  Now all you have to do is go to their website.

[00:30:34.908 --> 00:30:38.769]  On the internet, it is SacroWedgie.com.
[00:30:39.229 --> 00:30:44.130]  S-A-C-R-O W-E-D-G-Y dot com.
[00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:45.851]  SacroWedgie.com.
[00:30:46.311 --> 00:30:47.711]  Or you can use the toll-free number.
[00:30:47.731 --> 00:30:47.791]  1-800-737-8000.
[00:30:51.232 --> 00:30:51.813]  9295.
[00:30:51.352 --> 00:30:51.813]  That's 737-9295.
[00:30:51.953 --> 00:30:52.354]  Call them.
[00:30:52.694 --> 00:30:53.435]  It's only $29.95.
[00:30:53.495 --> 00:30:54.056]  And it really works.
[00:31:03.641 --> 00:31:06.663]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:06.963 --> 00:31:11.906]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:12.166 --> 00:31:16.508]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:16.809 --> 00:31:25.734]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:25.934 --> 00:31:29.556]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:29.836 --> 00:31:34.865]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:35.165 --> 00:31:41.916]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:42.397 --> 00:31:42.938]  What about you?
[00:31:43.687 --> 00:31:49.030]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:32:03.337 --> 00:32:04.497]  Why do you wear watches?
[00:32:04.797 --> 00:32:07.418]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[00:32:07.878 --> 00:32:15.540]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.681]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.

[00:32:56.107 --> 00:32:56.407]  That's 866-371-2330.
[00:33:12.521 --> 00:33:16.083]  So we have a government that says torturing people is good because it keeps us safe.
[00:33:16.203 --> 00:33:17.404]  Then we see the images of it.
[00:33:17.924 --> 00:33:19.085]  They retract those statements.
[00:33:19.105 --> 00:33:20.746]  They're trying to bathe us in this evil.
[00:33:22.647 --> 00:33:27.230]  Continuing with examples of our tyrannical empire, and their legion, but I'll just cover a few more.
[00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:34.494]  Under Section 802 of the USA Patriot Act, misdemeanor non-terror related crimes are listed as terrorism.
[00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:40.898]  Citizens are stripped of their most basic constitutional rights that were held sacred in the old republic.
[00:33:41.519 --> 00:33:46.302]  George Bush has set up a draconian Department of Homeland Security, giving FEMA the power to engage in mass arrest.
[00:33:46.862 --> 00:33:55.787]  Last year, the outgoing head of CENTCOM, General Tommy Franks, told the press that if America was attacked again, the Constitution will be set aside in favor of a military form of government.
[00:33:57.588 --> 00:34:06.914]  And again, in the new films, I've read the book, you know, the Emperor, soon-to-be Emperor, the Chancellor, it's a shame we're going to have to take everyone's rights if there's another attack.
[00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:20.256]  The federal government is dismantling the last vestiges of state's rights with its new federally standardized national ID card that has been integrated with thousands of private databases to track and trace our every action.
[00:34:21.056 --> 00:34:22.577]  Government-sponsored terrorism!
[00:34:24.598 --> 00:34:28.740]  When I first saw episode one, I instantly understood the plot being a student of history.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:30.101]  It made total sense!
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:36.584]  But I was amazed time and time again when talking to educated adults who were also Star Wars fans that they didn't get it.
[00:34:36.684 --> 00:34:38.345]  They'd say, it doesn't make any sense.
[00:34:38.865 --> 00:34:39.766]  I don't get the plot.
[00:34:40.427 --> 00:34:43.169]  The phenomenon got even worse when Episode 2 came out.
[00:34:43.509 --> 00:34:44.850]  People were totally confused.
[00:34:44.890 --> 00:34:48.112]  They didn't understand a plot that children could grasp.
[00:34:49.253 --> 00:34:54.857]  For those who are still confused, here is the story in a nutshell.
[00:34:56.167 --> 00:35:03.211]  In episode one, Senator Palatine is an obscure politician from the peaceful world of Nambu.
[00:35:04.412 --> 00:35:08.855]  The Senator influences Nambu not to pay its Trade Federation taxes.
[00:35:09.195 --> 00:35:22.103]  The corrupt Mercantile Trade Federation cartel then blockades the Nambu system and begins a ground invasion of its capital, taking their orders from the sinister leader, Darth Sidious.
[00:35:23.644 --> 00:35:28.168]  Sidious Lord of the Sith is one and the same with Senator Palatine.
[00:35:28.408 --> 00:35:30.070]  And it's totally clear that that's him.
[00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:31.591]  Adults don't understand that.
[00:35:32.052 --> 00:35:33.053]  Again, there's a blind spot.
[00:35:33.733 --> 00:35:40.659]  By manipulating the outcome of the Naboo Police action, he is able to springboard into the chancellorship of the Galactic Senate.
[00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:48.987]  Episode 2 begins with a widening conflict, threatening to destroy the hundreds of thousands of year old Republic.
[00:35:50.413 --> 00:35:51.874]  The 100,000-year-old Republic.
[00:35:52.234 --> 00:36:01.877]  The newly elected Chancellor is able to use the expanding crises as a pretext to pass police state legislation and to launch a mammoth military build-up.
[00:36:03.718 --> 00:36:06.598]  I'm writing notes here as I continue and I'm going to add to this article.
[00:36:06.979 --> 00:36:08.219]  First time I've read through what I've written.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:17.962]  As in Episode 1, Darth Sidious is in control of the Separatists, led by the charismatic Count Dooku, who is his secret apprentice, Darth Tyranus.
[00:36:18.583 --> 00:36:19.763]  They're again members of a secret
[00:36:20.447 --> 00:36:49.791]  uh... society secret society there Darth Sidious uses his agent Count Dooku to create the crisis the impending fall of the republic to threaten the republic into giving him the powers of a dictator this is the classic use of problem reaction solution create a crisis get the reaction of fear from the population and offer the solution of a police state that you control
[00:36:50.709 --> 00:37:03.296]  Real-world examples of this throughout history are Adolf Hitler, two months after being elected Chancellor, firebombed the German Parliament, a Reichstag building, blaming it on its political enemies, and declaring martial law.
[00:37:05.137 --> 00:37:06.958]  Most historians now believe that the U.S.
[00:37:06.998 --> 00:37:12.361]  government bombed its own ship in the Havana Harbor as a pretext to launch the Spanish-American War of 1898.
[00:37:13.945 --> 00:37:28.300]  The LBJ Presidential Library in 2003 released taped conversations between President Johnson and Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara in which they discussed how the Gulf of Tonkin attack never really took place and how to use it to officially kick off the Vietnam War.
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:35.047]  In early 2001, the Baltimore Sun and ABC News reported on a newly declassified operation codenamed
[00:37:35.934 --> 00:37:57.170]  Northwoods, where the Joint Chiefs of Staff proposed hijacking jets by remote control and crashing them, bombing D.C., committing sniper attacks in Miami and D.C., having the CIA attack the Guantanamo Bay Marine Corps base with mortars, and how to blame all of this terrorism on Cuba and the Soviet Union as a pretext for war.
[00:37:57.810 --> 00:38:01.453]  The plan was green-lighted all the way up to President Kennedy, who vetoed the plan.
[00:38:02.205 --> 00:38:03.626]  The bottom line is that the U.S.
[00:38:03.666 --> 00:38:07.107]  government plan to terrorize its own cities as a pretext for war.
[00:38:07.768 --> 00:38:19.673]  In Episode 3, the surviving Jedi realize, when it's too late, that the Clone Wars have been systematically crafted by the Sith Lord to destroy the Republic and the Jedi.
[00:38:20.093 --> 00:38:29.738]  In the end, the Emperor dispatches his dark apprentice, Darth Vader, to exterminate the Jedi and the leaders of the Separatist movement that the Chancellor controlled.
[00:38:30.558 --> 00:38:37.442]  Leaving the enemies of the Sith dead and the Sith in control of the central government, the despotic Galactic Empire is born!
[00:38:39.283 --> 00:38:43.866]  George W. Bush Problem Reaction Solution, another subsection.
[00:38:44.443 --> 00:38:54.052]  We look at the real world, the military-industrial complex that controls George Bush, and it is clear that the government is using the problem-reaction-solution system to bring in their own empire.
[00:38:54.592 --> 00:38:59.897]  Using the threat of terrorism, the executive branch has declared authoritarian powers unto itself.
[00:39:00.278 --> 00:39:10.047]  At the same time, they tell the people that they won't be safe until rogue nations, nations that are sovereign, are under world government control.
[00:39:11.701 --> 00:39:13.382]  Until they have taken over those nations.
[00:39:13.782 --> 00:39:14.783]  I need to clarify that.
[00:39:16.064 --> 00:39:20.367]  It is a fact that Bin Laden has been a CIA agent since at least 1981.
[00:39:20.647 --> 00:39:27.872]  The highest level of the CIA have publicly said that they do not want to catch him.
[00:39:29.673 --> 00:39:34.676]  The Bin Laden family has been in business with the Bush's for over 30 years.
[00:39:35.096 --> 00:39:35.757]  Bush Sr.
[00:39:35.777 --> 00:39:37.538]  and the Bin Laden's vacation together.
[00:39:37.858 --> 00:39:40.340]  The Bush's and the Bin Laden's are on the board of the
[00:39:41.411 --> 00:39:47.274]  The armament consortium of the Carlisle Group, whose profits have quadrupled since 9-11.
[00:39:47.914 --> 00:39:54.617]  The press has been forced to admit that the hijackers had their houses, cars, and credit cards paid for by the federal government.
[00:39:54.978 --> 00:39:56.198]  They were trained on U.S.
[00:39:56.218 --> 00:39:57.179]  military bases.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:39:59.500]  When U.S.
[00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:06.083]  embassies tried to block their entry into the U.S., the CIA ordered them to allow the hijackers to enter the nation.
[00:40:06.696 --> 00:40:11.640]  There are over 600 pieces of evidence that show that Bin Laden is George Bush's Count Dooku.
[00:40:13.021 --> 00:40:14.462]  Again, his crisis creator.
[00:40:15.043 --> 00:40:18.605]  Which are covered in detail in my three films on 9-11.
[00:40:18.966 --> 00:40:22.809]  The newest being Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:26.552]  Hollywood movies, art imitates life.
[00:40:26.672 --> 00:40:28.373]  I've noticed with fantasy
[00:40:31.539 --> 00:40:43.407]  I've noticed with fantasy movies and other works of art, people have trouble understanding the concept of would-be tyrants creating crises so that they can be offered their police state solution.
[00:40:43.907 --> 00:40:47.670]  We see popular Hollywood films peppered with this idea.
[00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:56.796]  In the blockbuster film The Incredibles, the evil genius Syndrome wants to be worshipped as a superhero, so he stages a robotic attack on a U.S.
[00:40:56.836 --> 00:41:01.259]  city, which he plans to then foil and come out as the hero.
[00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:14.517]  In the film Final Fantasy, it generally wants to be given pictorial powers, opens the gates so the enemy can attack New York, and then discredit his peacenik opponents, and seize power.
[00:41:15.598 --> 00:41:22.121]  There are countless examples of this, and I've noticed that when I talk to adults who've seen these films, they don't understand the plots.
[00:41:22.561 --> 00:41:25.042]  But when I talk to children, they completely grasp it.
[00:41:26.167 --> 00:41:33.090]  From a, again, psychological or sociological perspective, why is there this blind spot in adults?
[00:41:34.051 --> 00:41:36.012]  Is it being engineered into us?
[00:41:36.472 --> 00:41:45.676]  If so, why are so many intelligent people unable to grasp a children's plot line?
[00:41:46.357 --> 00:41:49.658]  No wonder they can't really understand what's behind 9-11.
[00:41:51.701 --> 00:41:54.325]  And again, then I'm going to go into examples and show photos.
[00:41:54.926 --> 00:41:57.229]  Darth Vader next to riot police.
[00:41:57.710 --> 00:42:02.858]  The new riot police have armored outfits, belts, in Seattle they even wore black capes.
[00:42:04.740 --> 00:42:05.702]  It's insane!
[00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:13.012]  The Black Armored Vehicles, the Terms, the new Military Uniforms, all of it.
[00:42:13.492 --> 00:42:18.318]  Star Wars being used as the name for the Strategic Defense Initiative and Space Command.
[00:42:18.338 --> 00:42:22.784]  I'm going to show how they engage in these dark arts and the Order of Death.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:32.306]  And how the rituals are to not care about anybody but yourself and are obsessed with murder and death at Skull and Bones and Bohemian Grove.
[00:42:33.186 --> 00:42:38.390]  How Star Wars imitates Nazis and the Bohemian Grove and Skull and Bones imitate Nazis.
[00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:43.775]  How it all springs from this same dark, fathomless pit.
[00:42:44.855 --> 00:42:52.141]  And I'll also, I've got a whole list of things I want to cover in this and then really try to illustrate this for people.
[00:42:53.607 --> 00:42:55.308]  Because they do it over and over again.
[00:42:55.368 --> 00:43:01.192]  I think Chuck Baldwin has boiled it down more succinctly, but with less detail.
[00:43:01.212 --> 00:43:04.674]  But it's an excellent article on PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:43:05.734 --> 00:43:09.937]  In the commentary section, Darth Vader and George W. Bush, a common vision of empire.
[00:43:11.044 --> 00:43:15.149]  The entertainment world is abuzz with the release of the final Star Wars episode.
[00:43:15.489 --> 00:43:17.351]  Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith.
[00:43:17.912 --> 00:43:25.340]  And this final installment of the popular sci-fi saga which has spanned more than two decades and has captured the imagination of young and old alike.
[00:43:25.971 --> 00:43:35.453]  One of the attractive elements of the creator, George Lucas, in Star Wars films has been the clear good versus evil theme that unambiguously appears throughout the story lines.
[00:43:35.493 --> 00:43:43.615]  However, according to early previews of the latest film, the clearly delineated lines between good and evil is not easily defined in Revenge of the Sith.
[00:43:44.376 --> 00:43:51.777]  The story centers around the principal evil character, Darth Vader's struggle and eventual surrender to the dark side.
[00:43:51.817 --> 00:43:53.838]  In the film, Lucas presents a
[00:43:54.875 --> 00:43:59.497]  dark and sordid picture of how the good Anakin Skywalker becomes the evil Darth Vader.
[00:43:59.557 --> 00:44:01.517]  Yet, there is another element to the storyline.
[00:44:01.898 --> 00:44:04.959]  There's a whole bunch of elements to the storyline.
[00:44:05.299 --> 00:44:11.881]  In Star Wars Episode 3, Revenge of the Sith, viewers also witnessed the demise of a republic and the rise of an empire.
[00:44:12.361 --> 00:44:21.845]  Lucas pictures a warmongered, bloodthirsty empire whose roots at once burrowed deeply into the soul of freedom and democracy, but no more.
[00:44:22.836 --> 00:44:29.760]  The once peace-loving republic has been turned into an aggressor state that laid waste to all its adversaries without mercy.
[00:44:30.320 --> 00:44:42.127]  After viewing the early releases of the movie, many viewers have come away from the screening rooms comparing Darth Vader's empire to the ambitions of President Bush, who again is a puppet, a front man for the Sith, if you would.
[00:44:42.868 --> 00:44:46.350]  This is kind of a general grievance.
[00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:55.272]  This is more than interesting when one considers that Lucas wrote the story before George Bush became president.
[00:44:55.312 --> 00:44:58.773]  In fact, Richard Nixon was in the White House when Lucas wrote Star Wars.
[00:44:59.033 --> 00:45:00.853]  However, the similarities appear to be striking.
[00:45:01.493 --> 00:45:03.954]  Again, he speaks to those articles where Lucas said that.
[00:45:04.434 --> 00:45:09.675]  At one point in the film, Anakin Skywalker says, just before becoming Darth Vader, you're either with me or you're with my enemy.
[00:45:10.315 --> 00:45:16.837]  Of course, we all know about Bush saying you're either with us or you're against us and you are with the terrorists.
[00:45:17.424 --> 00:45:22.866]  Speaking to reporters, Lucas said, when I wrote Star Wars, again, the war in Iraq didn't exist.
[00:45:22.906 --> 00:45:24.326]  It was a parallel with Vietnam.
[00:45:24.586 --> 00:45:27.047]  But he went on to say, it's scary what's happening in America.
[00:45:27.327 --> 00:45:28.508]  I hope it doesn't come true.
[00:45:29.028 --> 00:45:36.250]  Remember, a dictatorship can be composed of one all-powerful ruler or a group of all-powerful rulers.
[00:45:36.531 --> 00:45:39.492]  An oligarchy is just as tyrannical as a monarchy.
[00:45:39.672 --> 00:45:44.453]  I recommend that everyone read Pat Buchanan's book, A Republic for an Empire.
[00:45:46.174 --> 00:45:46.754]  Absolutely.
[00:45:48.397 --> 00:46:02.721]  Obviously, one of the markers of an empire is an insustainable desire for war, the constant need for military incursions into foreign territories, regardless of the cost in dollars or human lives.
[00:46:03.061 --> 00:46:05.262]  An empire can never rest from armed conflict.
[00:46:05.302 --> 00:46:09.103]  Indeed, amid conflict feeds and sustains the empire, which
[00:46:10.126 --> 00:46:12.489]  Brings us to George W. Bush's administration.
[00:46:12.949 --> 00:46:20.298]  Virtually everyone now knows that the reasons George Bush gave for invading Iraq were invalid and were deceptive.
[00:46:20.358 --> 00:46:26.425]  Therefore, whatever the real reasons for the invasion were, they were known only to Bush and a few selected insiders.
[00:46:26.685 --> 00:46:28.628]  Well, they told us in PNAC what their plan was.
[00:46:29.108 --> 00:46:36.989]  Furthermore, not only is there a resolution in sight for America's military involvement in Iraq, there is no resolution in sight.
[00:46:37.049 --> 00:46:42.190]  It now seems that the Bush administration is making plans to extend the war into Syria, Iran, and even North Korea.
[00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:47.831]  I believe it is time for the American people, especially conservatives, to begin asking themselves some serious questions.
[00:46:47.871 --> 00:46:52.772]  Does George W. Bush intend the United States to be a state of perpetual war?
[00:46:52.792 --> 00:46:55.012]  He said it's going to be a hundred-year war.
[00:46:55.032 --> 00:46:56.693]  I have a note there.
[00:46:56.713 --> 00:46:57.233]  A hundred-year war.
[00:46:57.293 --> 00:46:58.273]  That's an important point to make.
[00:46:59.401 --> 00:47:05.107]  If he is seeking monsters to destroy, does he envision a global empire headed by an all-powerful ruler?
[00:47:05.528 --> 00:47:17.921]  These questions deserve studious attention, especially when one recalls that shortly after being elected President, George Bush once quipped, if this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[00:47:18.662 --> 00:47:19.923]  Great point.
[00:47:20.586 --> 00:47:22.187]  Consider that he was not joking.
[00:47:22.587 --> 00:47:40.420]  President Bush is making it very difficult for conservatives, such as myself, to articulate to people the differences between the need for an independent republic, what America used to be, for a strong, ready defense, and the need for a global empire, what America is becoming, for an omnipotent, omnipresent global police force,
[00:47:41.385 --> 00:47:47.007]  Put another way, does Lucas' fictional character Darth Vader and President George W. Bush share a common vision of empire?
[00:47:47.307 --> 00:47:50.848]  And would the American people even be able to recognize it if they did?
[00:47:51.588 --> 00:47:52.589]  Excellent job!
[00:47:54.009 --> 00:47:56.190]  I hadn't even read that article until the alphabet got on air.
[00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:57.390]  I just read the first few paragraphs.
[00:47:57.630 --> 00:47:58.531]  There's so many of these.
[00:47:58.551 --> 00:48:00.471]  And that's at PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:48:01.312 --> 00:48:03.392]  And Paul Watson, I know you're listening, my friend.
[00:48:03.913 --> 00:48:07.934]  Why don't you go get the original article my wife wrote a few months ago about this.
[00:48:09.318 --> 00:48:11.739]  It's in a hyperlink from a repost yesterday.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:28.650]  It was the article about Art Imitates Life with Episode 3 and it's the one where she talks about the plotline from the Star Wars on website about how they create terrorist events to get the police state going and posts that with this Chuck Baldwin article under it.
[00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:31.051]  I think those two are a good companion piece.
[00:48:31.832 --> 00:48:33.673]  Don't you love me directing from here on air?
[00:48:33.733 --> 00:48:34.213]  I don't have time.
[00:48:34.233 --> 00:48:35.034]  I have to do it on air, folks.
[00:48:35.054 --> 00:48:37.055]  I haven't been doing an interview since
[00:48:38.129 --> 00:48:41.531]  Six o'clock this morning and trying to write articles.
[00:48:41.591 --> 00:48:42.071]  It's crazy.
[00:48:42.291 --> 00:48:42.912]  Not whining.
[00:48:42.932 --> 00:48:45.613]  I just want to do a better job and I need everybody's help to do this.
[00:48:46.153 --> 00:48:55.418]  But today I will have my big lengthy piece written and expanded and added full of hyperlinks to other good stories like Chuck Baldwin's and the one my wife wrote.
[00:48:56.099 --> 00:49:15.867]  uh... has written a few weeks ago so that's coming up uh... before i end this this segment come back and take a few calls for congressman tom ten credo joins us and then paul watson martial law nine eleven rise of the police state out of the ashes of september eleventh tragedy dark empire of war and tyranny has risen
[00:49:16.627 --> 00:49:19.268]  The Constitution has been shredded and America is now a police state.
[00:49:19.648 --> 00:49:24.489]  The film exposes not just who was behind 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:49:24.829 --> 00:49:28.410]  Learn the terrifying secret that holds the future of the world in its grasp.
[00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:35.972]  Again, the globalists can only operate in secrecy, just like in the fictional world of Star Wars, the Sith only operate in secrecy.
[00:49:36.793 --> 00:49:41.674]  Just like Skull and Bones and the Fool Society and the Thule Society only operate in secrecy.
[00:49:42.819 --> 00:49:53.994]  From the front lines of a police state to the darkest sanctum of the secret society that controls it, martial law reveals the master plan of a group hell-bent on capturing America today and tomorrow the world.
[00:49:54.495 --> 00:49:57.358]  The New World Order has set in motion the Fourth Reich.
[00:49:57.899 --> 00:50:03.044]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:50:03.305 --> 00:50:11.613]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into their own prison planet.

[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.502]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:17.542 --> 00:51:18.923]  The New World Order.

[00:52:16.649 --> 00:52:21.333]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:21.793 --> 00:52:28.515]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:28.915 --> 00:52:40.699]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[00:54:48.818 --> 00:54:49.579]  Go ahead, Stavos.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:51.141]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:51.281 --> 00:54:53.743]  I just wanted to talk about a couple of issues.
[00:54:53.783 --> 00:55:03.372]  Firstly, on the CBC News up here in Canada, there was a story about an American who murdered an elderly couple in New Brunswick, and he went back across the border.
[00:55:03.432 --> 00:55:05.434]  He had a bag full of weapons.
[00:55:06.027 --> 00:55:11.691]  And the bag and his clothing were soaked in blood, but the border people just waved at him as he went by.
[00:55:11.711 --> 00:55:14.013]  Yeah, it's both ways, sir.
[00:55:14.033 --> 00:55:14.834]  It's just sickening.
[00:55:15.054 --> 00:55:21.799]  The borders are totally wide open, and it's a complete and total joke, and they've ordered the Border Patrol to stand down.
[00:55:23.941 --> 00:55:24.301]  It's nuts.
[00:55:24.581 --> 00:55:28.264]  That is like one of the most glaring examples I've ever heard.
[00:55:29.994 --> 00:55:54.330]  Sir, we have a railway killer who was arrested, I think it was like 5 or 6 times for assault, rape, he was a murder suspect, the cops thought he was a murder suspect, and he was arrested again, it was over 5 times, but in Houston they just said releasing, he was part of 400,000 people just in South Texas alone ordered to be released from jails who were illegal aliens.
[00:55:54.350 --> 00:55:56.532]  They have a license to kill, steal,
[00:55:57.681 --> 00:55:59.383]  Free healthcare, free everything.
[00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:00.624]  It's just unbelievable, sir.
[00:56:00.784 --> 00:56:01.585]  It's all on purpose.
[00:56:02.005 --> 00:56:05.148]  I think they said he killed like 10 or 11 people that they know of.
[00:56:06.669 --> 00:56:07.010]  Yeah.
[00:56:08.251 --> 00:56:13.796]  Um, but the second issue before I forget, um, you know how you're talking about these secret societies and stuff like that, right?
[00:56:13.836 --> 00:56:16.118]  And a lot of it is like occultic white supremacy.
[00:56:16.678 --> 00:56:21.743]  Well, um, I've been looking into into this and I found there's a lot of connections that go into Turkey.
[00:56:22.423 --> 00:56:23.144]  I had seen that, yes!
[00:56:41.655 --> 00:56:43.256]  Sir, listen, listen.
[00:56:43.716 --> 00:56:45.837]  George Lucas says he built all this on history.
[00:56:46.257 --> 00:56:48.198]  They wore Nazi uniforms.
[00:56:48.618 --> 00:56:54.501]  Vader's got an extended Nazi helmet that German artillery troops actually wore.
[00:56:54.761 --> 00:56:56.362]  It looked just like Darth Vader's hat.
[00:56:56.882 --> 00:56:59.063]  It's the Death Society, the Skull and Bones.
[00:57:00.023 --> 00:57:02.104]  And so he just expands on that.
[00:57:02.325 --> 00:57:04.746]  And that's why it's so scary to people deep down.
[00:57:05.646 --> 00:57:09.868]  Because he admits he went to study the occult and studied these archetypal images.
[00:57:11.078 --> 00:57:14.119]  You know, it's like the Ringwraiths from Lord of the Rings.
[00:57:14.379 --> 00:57:15.739]  Look like Darth Vader, basically.
[00:57:15.759 --> 00:57:16.560]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[00:57:18.500 --> 00:57:22.901]  I'm curious though, does George... That's another note I gotta write, I gotta mention Lord of the Rings in the article.
[00:57:23.982 --> 00:57:29.883]  Does George Lucas, has he seen any of your films, or do you know if he has, or... I don't think so, I don't know.
[00:57:30.623 --> 00:57:32.704]  I guess one of us should go and send it to him then.
[00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:35.869]  Well, I'm not defending George Lucas.
[00:57:35.989 --> 00:57:37.469]  He's a Buddhist and I don't believe in that.
[00:57:37.909 --> 00:57:42.650]  But, at the same time, Lucas made THX 1138, his first film.
[00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:46.671]  It was his college film and then his first big feature film with Robert Duvall.
[00:57:47.671 --> 00:57:50.191]  I've actually screened that and shown that here in Texas.
[00:57:51.011 --> 00:57:55.632]  And in it, you know, it's a forced drug population, shaved heads, controlled.
[00:57:56.012 --> 00:57:58.113]  Lucas knows all about the New World Order.
[00:57:58.373 --> 00:57:58.773]  In fact,
[00:57:59.722 --> 00:58:01.703]  That's what the emperor says in this new one.
[00:58:02.023 --> 00:58:03.304]  This is the new order.
[00:58:03.464 --> 00:58:06.045]  I mean, it's just in your face, brother.
[00:58:06.105 --> 00:58:06.325]  Man.
[00:58:08.066 --> 00:58:08.406]  Awesome.
[00:58:08.466 --> 00:58:09.326]  Thank you so much, Alex.
[00:58:09.386 --> 00:58:10.207]  Keep up the good work.
[00:58:10.287 --> 00:58:12.188]  And I'm going to be doing everything I can up here.
[00:58:12.948 --> 00:58:13.728]  Spreading the word around.
[00:58:13.788 --> 00:58:16.029]  I'm giving your film out on DVD to a lot of people.
[00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:19.791]  So... Oh, you've seen Martial Law?
[00:58:20.689 --> 00:58:21.450]  I haven't seen Marshall.
[00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:22.932]  I have everything else except that.
[00:58:22.953 --> 00:58:24.475]  That's the next one I have to get.
[00:58:24.495 --> 00:58:26.217]  Well, I'm glad that you're making copies of the films.
[00:58:26.277 --> 00:58:28.220]  It's you that gives us program power.
[00:58:28.641 --> 00:58:29.342]  The D program.
[00:58:29.382 --> 00:58:29.743]  Thank you.
[00:58:30.444 --> 00:58:32.507]  We'll be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:32.527 --> 00:58:33.348]  I know we've got loaded phones.
[00:58:33.368 --> 00:58:34.510]  We've got a congressman coming up.
[00:58:35.291 --> 00:58:37.414]  And we'll get your calls early with Paul Watson.
[00:58:37.594 --> 00:58:38.855]  You can hold or you can hang up.
[00:58:39.576 --> 00:58:40.417]  We'll be getting to you.
[00:58:40.777 --> 00:58:43.481]  Sometimes congressmen don't show up, too, so you could be going right to your calls.
[00:58:43.841 --> 00:58:46.744]  But he's scheduled to be calling in right now!
[00:58:47.625 --> 00:58:48.586]  Alright, keep it locked in.
[00:58:48.606 --> 00:58:50.469]  We'll be back after this quick break with The Second Hour.
[00:59:00.388 --> 00:59:01.009]  Big Brother.
[00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:02.731]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:03.452 --> 00:59:04.554]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:05.235 --> 00:59:06.036]  You want answers?
[00:59:06.797 --> 00:59:07.698]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:07.718 --> 00:59:12.043]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:12.544 --> 00:59:16.609]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.810 --> 00:59:22.574]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, Paul Watson from the United Kingdom will be on with us in 30 minutes.
[00:59:22.634 --> 00:59:38.989]  We've got a ton of news about eugenics programs, forced sterilization of the American people, now hitting ABC News, old news here, a lot of news on the Iraq War, the economy, Star Wars, the release of that coming up and how it ties into the real world, mirrors what real empires do.
[00:59:41.239 --> 00:59:48.583]  But right now we're honored to have Congressman Tom Tancredo and you can check out his website at Tancredo.house.gov.
[00:59:48.603 --> 00:59:53.065]  Tancredo is T-A-N-C-R-E-D-O.house.gov.
[00:59:53.345 --> 00:59:57.287]  We have a link to his house website at Infowars.com.
[00:59:57.667 --> 01:00:00.529]  He is the chairman of the Congressional Immigration Caucus.
[01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:08.032]  He's wildly popular in his state because the majority of Americans want to control the borders and defend our sovereignty and our jobs.
[01:00:08.993 --> 01:00:09.173]  But
[01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:10.930]  We had J.D.
[01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:14.953]  Hayworth on Friday, another Congressman, a member of his caucus.
[01:00:15.554 --> 01:00:19.377]  The Border Patrol ordered to stand down to make the Minutemen look bad!
[01:00:20.077 --> 01:00:23.280]  Here to talk about this and many other immigration issues is the Congressman.
[01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:27.082]  Congressman, thank you so much for spending time on your busy schedule to join us.
[01:00:27.323 --> 01:00:28.443]  It's a pleasure to be with you.
[01:00:29.624 --> 01:00:38.010]  Just out of the gates, what did you think when you first heard, it's now confirmed, 12 Border Patrol have gone public, as well as the Union, that they were ordered to stand down?
[01:00:38.411 --> 01:00:38.531]  Yeah.
[01:00:39.384 --> 01:00:40.105]  Not surprised.
[01:00:40.485 --> 01:00:41.125]  Not surprised.
[01:00:41.306 --> 01:00:47.370]  But I guess it's because I've been around this issue now for so long that hardly anything surprises me.
[01:00:47.410 --> 01:01:00.260]  But I think that you have to really consider how this kind of thing happened and understand that it is not in the decision of one man, in this case, Michael Knightley.
[01:01:00.300 --> 01:01:02.121]  He's the one that sent the order down.
[01:01:03.030 --> 01:01:05.411]  And he's the one whose head should roll.
[01:01:05.831 --> 01:01:07.892]  He should, in fact, be fired.
[01:01:07.912 --> 01:01:09.552]  There's no two ways about that, in my mind.
[01:01:10.372 --> 01:01:11.533]  But he probably won't be.
[01:01:12.133 --> 01:01:21.756]  And one reason he won't be is because what he's doing is actually enforcing an unwritten policy of this administration.
[01:01:22.696 --> 01:01:23.916]  This comes from the top.
[01:01:25.137 --> 01:01:32.599]  If the President of the United States had actually determined at any point in time that we are going to
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.721]  Truly defend our borders.
[01:01:35.802 --> 01:01:38.784]  I assure you that message would get passed down the line.
[01:01:39.305 --> 01:01:42.947]  But it's the opposite message that gets delivered.
[01:01:43.488 --> 01:01:57.639]  And hence, you've got people like Nicely trying their best to accommodate what they know to be the position taken by the leadership in their organization, and eventually by the President of the United States.
[01:01:57.899 --> 01:01:58.759]  Now, I'm a Republican.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:00.381]  And I've been one all my life.
[01:02:00.881 --> 01:02:02.062]  And I've supported the President.
[01:02:02.731 --> 01:02:10.156]  And on many issues, of course, I think he is the right on, but on this one, he is so far off base that it's pitiful.
[01:02:10.616 --> 01:02:21.744]  Well, it's called treason, and I know you won't probably go that far, but saying we're going to be attacked any minute by terrorists, give up all our liberties, take national ID cards, but by the way, we're going to have the border wide open.
[01:02:21.784 --> 01:02:23.725]  I had the head of the Border Patrol Union on last year.
[01:02:23.745 --> 01:02:24.606]  I'm going to get him back on.
[01:02:25.266 --> 01:02:28.608]  And he said back then, there's an unwritten rule to turn our eyes.
[01:02:29.029 --> 01:02:31.610]  We're told we can look one direction on the road, but not the other.
[01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:32.911]  We see illegals walking by.
[01:02:32.931 --> 01:02:34.212]  That's been in the news.
[01:02:34.532 --> 01:02:36.734]  You've been here and covered that.
[01:02:36.854 --> 01:02:42.818]  I mean, this is treason to say we're under threat of attack, and then order the Border Patrol to stand down.
[01:02:42.998 --> 01:02:43.818]  Yeah, it's incredible.
[01:02:43.898 --> 01:02:48.561]  And I have a... For years I have been saying that
[01:02:50.222 --> 01:02:54.165]  You know, I've got some big problems in this Congress trying to get anything accomplished.
[01:02:54.265 --> 01:03:01.489]  One is the Democratic Party that sees massive immigration, both legal and illegal, as a source of voters.
[01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:06.993]  The other problem I have is the Republican Party that sees that same phenomenon as a source of cheap labor.
[01:03:07.093 --> 01:03:11.676]  And then the third is the President that wants to make a niche issue out of this.
[01:03:11.816 --> 01:03:15.759]  And I used to be able to say that prior to his second election.
[01:03:16.383 --> 01:03:20.427]  But now, of course, you can't really blame it on just the politics of it.
[01:03:20.787 --> 01:03:23.890]  Well, it's wildly unpopular to do to begin with, so I don't buy that.
[01:03:24.150 --> 01:03:27.773]  This is the policy of the corporate interest that won a Pan-American Union.
[01:03:27.813 --> 01:03:28.854]  Yes, you are right.
[01:03:29.274 --> 01:03:37.722]  I absolutely agree with you that there is only one conclusion to which you can come at this point in time, and that is there is a plan, a desperate attempt to
[01:03:40.919 --> 01:03:46.661]  Eliminate borders because of a view of the world in which certainly I do not share.
[01:03:46.981 --> 01:03:49.002]  I'm just going to stay there one more segment with us.
[01:03:49.022 --> 01:03:50.463]  I want to recap what you've just said.
[01:03:50.803 --> 01:03:51.563]  Very profound.
[01:03:51.583 --> 01:03:54.024]  We'll be back with the Honorable Congressman Tom Tancredo.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:57.301]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:57.481 --> 01:04:00.582]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:04:00.702 --> 01:04:04.604]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:04.644 --> 01:04:08.885]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:09.226 --> 01:04:13.007]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:13.087 --> 01:04:14.928]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:15.188 --> 01:04:18.430]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:04:18.470 --> 01:04:23.214]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:23.374 --> 01:04:26.416]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:04:26.576 --> 01:04:29.438]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:29.938 --> 01:04:36.063]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:40.368]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:04:40.789 --> 01:04:42.170]  Order your video today.
[01:04:42.491 --> 01:04:43.572]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:04:43.592 --> 01:04:45.895]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.357]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:04:55.126 --> 01:04:58.409]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:58.449 --> 01:05:02.652]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:02.893 --> 01:05:05.675]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:05.875 --> 01:05:08.277]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:08.457 --> 01:05:17.124]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:17.304 --> 01:05:18.645]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[01:05:18.846 --> 01:05:23.029]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.850]  We're good to go!
[01:05:54.670 --> 01:06:02.637]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:06:03.017 --> 01:06:04.278]  It suppresses your immune system.
[01:06:04.498 --> 01:06:05.159]  Now check this out.
[01:06:05.539 --> 01:06:08.962]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:06:08.982 --> 01:06:11.404]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year!
[01:06:11.924 --> 01:06:14.585]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:06:14.845 --> 01:06:15.626]  Your health suffers.
[01:06:15.866 --> 01:06:16.506]  It's that simple.
[01:06:16.846 --> 01:06:20.788]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[01:06:21.248 --> 01:06:29.151]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:33.715]  For a limited time only, get a Garicus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[01:06:34.055 --> 01:06:35.416]  Call 877-817-9829 to order a Garicus Bio at 20% off.
[01:06:35.436 --> 01:06:37.398]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[01:06:37.438 --> 01:06:37.959]  A Garicus Bio.
[01:06:37.999 --> 01:06:39.040]  Because healthy is what you want to do.
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.261]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[01:07:00.442 --> 01:07:01.082]  Big Brother.
[01:07:01.743 --> 01:07:02.784]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:03.504 --> 01:07:04.605]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:05.266 --> 01:07:06.086]  You want answers?
[01:07:06.867 --> 01:07:08.148]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:08.408 --> 01:07:12.092]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:12.592 --> 01:07:16.716]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.857 --> 01:07:20.199]  Alright, we have Congressman Tom Tancredo.
[01:07:20.259 --> 01:07:23.782]  He is the Chairman of the Immigration Reform Caucus.
[01:07:25.012 --> 01:07:33.515]  In major polls, 80 plus percent of Americans, including the vast majority of Hispanics, want to control our borders, want to have national sovereignty.
[01:07:33.555 --> 01:07:35.596]  People know it's bad for our economy.
[01:07:36.116 --> 01:07:40.478]  NAFTA and GATT and CAFTA and now the FTAA are expanding.
[01:07:40.678 --> 01:07:48.981]  Very bad for everybody, including Mexico, but good for the globalists who want to centralize control and use slave labor to leverage out their competition.
[01:07:49.855 --> 01:07:51.356]  To create worldwide monopolies.
[01:07:51.897 --> 01:08:03.766]  And again, I've had the Border Patrol President on, and he told us a year ago that they've been ordered to stand down in many areas, that they're told to keep their arrests down, their apprehensions down, of smugglers, drug dealers, human traffickers.
[01:08:03.806 --> 01:08:05.007]  I mean, it is a nightmare!
[01:08:05.287 --> 01:08:14.395]  Federal officers being killed routinely and wounded, vehicles being shot up, just happened again in Texas last Friday, the same day the Washington Times broke the news
[01:08:15.075 --> 01:08:27.182]  That the Border Patrol in Arizona was told to stand down because tens of thousands of illegals bottlenecked during the month that a thousand volunteers sat there in lawn chairs calling the Border Patrol every time they saw illegal aliens.
[01:08:27.482 --> 01:08:28.923]  They had to put on a show for a month.
[01:08:28.943 --> 01:08:35.566]  So they were told, so we don't get higher numbers pouring across, you know, that showing up on the radar screen, don't arrest these people.
[01:08:35.986 --> 01:08:37.007]  Which is total treason.
[01:08:37.027 --> 01:08:39.008]  We're told terrorists are about to attack us any minute.
[01:08:39.368 --> 01:08:41.209]  Give up all your rights in America to stop them.
[01:08:41.549 --> 01:08:44.031]  But then the President is ordering his minions to do this.
[01:08:44.811 --> 01:08:53.235]  Tom Tancredo, in the last segment that a lot of stations don't carry, said, and I want him to repeat that in his own words, that Bush has been re-elected.
[01:08:53.435 --> 01:08:56.216]  It was never a popular issue, like he claimed it was politics.
[01:08:56.517 --> 01:08:58.557]  Now he's been re-elected and he's peddled the metal!
[01:09:00.438 --> 01:09:00.919]  Amnesty.
[01:09:01.799 --> 01:09:06.721]  And he's working with the Democrats to do that, and a lot of Republicans as well.
[01:09:06.821 --> 01:09:09.883]  So, you were saying, Congressman, that this
[01:09:11.391 --> 01:09:14.372]  Border Patrol Minion Chief needs to be fired.
[01:09:14.392 --> 01:09:17.852]  I say Aguilar needs to be fired too, but you're saying that's not going to happen.
[01:09:18.092 --> 01:09:20.993]  So please recap, blow-by-blow, what we're facing.
[01:09:21.013 --> 01:09:23.073]  Then I want to get into CAFTA and FTAA.
[01:09:23.093 --> 01:09:25.074]  All right.
[01:09:26.214 --> 01:09:33.376]  We can get mad at Mr. Nicely, who is the fellow who supposedly sent this order down.
[01:09:33.576 --> 01:09:34.576]  And what is his position, sir?
[01:09:35.196 --> 01:09:39.857]  He is head of ICE, Immigration Customs and Enforcement.
[01:09:40.965 --> 01:09:46.687]  Uh... he has a uh... a responsibility that is placed there.
[01:09:46.707 --> 01:10:02.373]  I mean he is a uh... it's true he's a member of the bureaucracy but but what I'm telling you is that what's happening inside Homeland Security is a reflection of the direction that the President sets.
[01:10:03.273 --> 01:10:05.234]  We can't just blame Mr. Nicely.
[01:10:05.274 --> 01:10:07.635]  This is... I guarantee you that this is not
[01:10:09.565 --> 01:10:11.186]  Well, this is the policy.
[01:10:11.246 --> 01:10:15.070]  I mean, Bush tells the Border Patrol to spend four hours a day picking up trash.
[01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:18.775]  I mean, they tell them they can't look north or south.
[01:10:18.795 --> 01:10:20.677]  They can only look west or east when they're on the border.
[01:10:21.077 --> 01:10:29.226]  Yeah, it's called being on the X. There's an actual big X painted on the asphalt.
[01:10:29.938 --> 01:10:33.062]  Uh, where they're to park their car, park their vehicle.
[01:10:33.202 --> 01:10:34.824]  And the coyotes have those maps.
[01:10:34.885 --> 01:10:35.445]  That's right.
[01:10:35.465 --> 01:10:37.227]  Well, I mean, you could look right at him.
[01:10:37.247 --> 01:10:39.030]  You can just see him and say, well, he's parked there.
[01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:40.512]  I'm going to go right next to him.
[01:10:40.552 --> 01:10:46.659]  And he's not supposed to be able to do anything about the fact that he actually sees an alien crossing the border.
[01:10:46.699 --> 01:10:47.801]  He's got to stay where he is.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:48.960]  In that car.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:50.101]  So this is the policy?
[01:10:50.481 --> 01:10:51.262]  Yeah, this is the policy.
[01:10:51.322 --> 01:10:52.902]  And you're saying this guy should be fired?
[01:10:53.243 --> 01:10:54.783]  Oh, absolutely he should be fired.
[01:10:55.023 --> 01:11:00.786]  He won't be fired because he's really following the dictates of this administration.
[01:11:00.866 --> 01:11:05.429]  He's not going to fire somebody for doing what the president wants him to do.
[01:11:05.449 --> 01:11:08.270]  You know, and that's what he's doing.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:13.985]  I'm sorry, I said Mr. Neistat is actually the head of the Tucson sector.
[01:11:14.145 --> 01:11:18.850]  Yes, obviously, and we've got Aguilar over the whole thing.
[01:11:19.610 --> 01:11:21.272]  Please restate what you said.
[01:11:21.352 --> 01:11:22.393]  This is so important.
[01:11:23.034 --> 01:11:25.777]  From everything you've looked at, why is the government doing this?
[01:11:26.017 --> 01:11:29.541]  Because the President is like his father.
[01:11:29.681 --> 01:11:30.762]  He isn't international.
[01:11:31.628 --> 01:11:34.189]  There is an absolute plan.
[01:11:34.369 --> 01:11:49.675]  I know this gets into the black helicopter stuff, but I will tell you that there is a commitment to bring the North and South American continents together in a way that would reflect the European Union.
[01:11:49.795 --> 01:11:56.198]  Well, they're building the NAFTA superhighway and I watched Bush in 2001 up in Canada and they said Pan-American Union.
[01:11:56.418 --> 01:12:01.040]  Listen, what about just a few months ago when Bush and Paul Martin and Fox met?
[01:12:01.624 --> 01:12:05.086]  There was a summit of the three leaders of those countries.
[01:12:05.286 --> 01:12:07.887]  We're having the bi-congress down in Mexico?
[01:12:08.948 --> 01:12:10.669]  Here's what happened.
[01:12:11.689 --> 01:12:16.292]  Subsequent to that meeting, a working group was formed.
[01:12:17.692 --> 01:12:29.198]  The purpose of which, as stated, publicly stated, was to work out the problems that exist that presently prevent an integration of the economies of those three countries.
[01:12:29.498 --> 01:12:30.599]  And, by the way,
[01:12:31.434 --> 01:12:35.037]  Work out the problems that exist to creating a common perimeter.
[01:12:36.538 --> 01:12:37.559]  And a common currency.
[01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:39.560]  The Canadian papers are full of it.
[01:12:39.820 --> 01:12:41.982]  They're horrified at giving up their sovereignty.
[01:12:42.302 --> 01:12:43.303]  Mexico loves it.
[01:12:43.523 --> 01:12:45.985]  It's all over Mexican papers, all over Canadian papers.
[01:12:46.205 --> 01:12:51.069]  You tell the average American, this congressman, that you know well you're in the middle of it, and they tell you black helicopters.
[01:12:51.289 --> 01:12:51.970]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:59.135]  And so, the fact is that if you are committed to this, quote, integrated economy,
[01:12:59.963 --> 01:13:07.509]  for Mexico, United States and Canada and beyond that eventually free trade of the Americas which will be also South America.
[01:13:09.871 --> 01:13:25.823]  Then all of the attempts we make here to secure our borders are antithetical to that goal and that's why they find themselves in this incredibly perplexing situation of having the American public 80, 70, 80 percent demanding borders
[01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:37.549]  Well, simultaneously they are committing themselves to treaties and trade arrangements that abandon them.
[01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:43.693]  They are simultaneously tearing down the castle walls while telling us they're doing something to keep us safe.
[01:13:44.414 --> 01:13:54.521]  They have to go to bed every single night and thank God that we did not have an event that day perpetrated by someone who's come across these borders and that we've been able to actually stop
[01:13:55.582 --> 01:13:56.163]  Quite a number.
[01:13:56.303 --> 01:14:00.967]  Well, a third of our prisoners are illegal aliens in the western states.
[01:14:01.027 --> 01:14:03.429]  So, already the terror events are being committed.
[01:14:04.249 --> 01:14:05.110]  Yeah, well that's true.
[01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:11.555]  But, you know, I still say that, and I've said this before... You're talking about somebody going into school and killing 100 people.
[01:14:11.575 --> 01:14:11.815]  Sure.
[01:14:12.016 --> 01:14:19.402]  The President of the United States has a very difficult time, all of us do, uttering the words, I'm wrong, or I was wrong.
[01:14:19.822 --> 01:14:20.963]  That's hard, you know?
[01:14:21.163 --> 01:14:22.144]  And people in public life
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:45.178]  It's almost a, you know, I don't know if I've ever heard it, actually, but it hardly ever comes out, and the President is certainly not inclined, he's not inclined, from a personality standpoint, no, from a political standpoint, to ever say anything like that, but I would say if he, you know, it's a lot easier, Mr. President, to say right now, you were wrong.
[01:14:45.638 --> 01:14:58.023]  Then it is to eventually have to stay after something, after the bomb goes off, after the biological or chemical weapon goes off.
[01:14:58.951 --> 01:15:03.595]  It's a lot easier to say, I was wrong now, than it is to have to say then, I'm sorry.
[01:15:03.715 --> 01:15:14.384]  Well, the White House has been running around, as you know, Congressman, being in a near border state, Colorado, they've been running around for a year and a half saying Al-Qaeda plans to come across the southern border and kill everybody in a public school.
[01:15:14.925 --> 01:15:22.571]  Yeah, well, you know what, I came back from, I was in Russia, I went to Beslan, which is a place where there was a terrorist attack at Al-Qaeda.
[01:15:23.386 --> 01:15:29.728]  Well, a terrorist, fundamentalist, Islamic attack, I should say, on a little school in Beslan.
[01:15:29.748 --> 01:15:30.429]  Do you remember that?
[01:15:30.989 --> 01:15:31.269]  Yes.
[01:15:31.909 --> 01:15:42.053]  This was last year, and because my district includes Columbine High School, I had some compassion and some empathy for what happened there.
[01:15:42.293 --> 01:15:48.435]  At the time, I didn't know the extent of the actual damage that had been done, but I got on a plane, my wife and I,
[01:15:48.993 --> 01:15:49.773]  We went to Russia.
[01:15:50.494 --> 01:15:51.634]  I went to Beslan.
[01:15:51.954 --> 01:15:56.976]  I brought with them all kinds of messages from the kids at Columbine High School and from the community.
[01:15:57.417 --> 01:16:01.898]  When I got there, it became apparent just exactly how incredible the attack was.
[01:16:02.359 --> 01:16:08.781]  I was driving from the airport in an armored vehicle trying to get to the school in a town of 25,000 people, by the way.
[01:16:09.061 --> 01:16:12.023]  And as we passed the graveyard, they were digging 600 graves.
[01:16:13.756 --> 01:16:15.357]  600 graves in a count of 25,000.
[01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:24.123]  It was a terrorist attack planned on this little community because it would be, of course, essentially undefended, and it would strike terror into the hearts of the community.
[01:16:24.503 --> 01:16:30.547]  It was fundamentalist Islamic terrorists who did it from Chechnya.
[01:16:30.987 --> 01:16:32.548]  I got back from that event.
[01:16:33.428 --> 01:16:34.249]  I got back home.
[01:16:34.409 --> 01:16:37.391]  I opened the portfolio I had in front of me.
[01:16:38.194 --> 01:16:40.895]  To see the week's events that have accumulated.
[01:16:40.995 --> 01:16:52.982]  And there on the front, on the top of the stack, was a memo from Homeland Security saying that they had identified 25 Chechens who had entered the country illegally.
[01:16:53.262 --> 01:16:59.425]  They found some communications from them somewhere in Mexico and then communications somewhere in Arizona.
[01:16:59.665 --> 01:17:01.986]  So they know they came into the country, they came in illegally.
[01:17:03.527 --> 01:17:05.548]  Below that was a memo from
[01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:14.408]  From the Department of Education and Homeland Security to every single school in America saying we anticipate an attack on a school.
[01:17:14.929 --> 01:17:19.272]  Please identify if you any of the... I mean be wary of the following and then it went through a list.
[01:17:19.352 --> 01:17:21.254]  And Congressman let me just add this here.
[01:17:21.274 --> 01:17:22.255]  This is so important.
[01:17:22.859 --> 01:17:24.941]  Now, Homeland Security's putting these reports out.
[01:17:25.361 --> 01:17:26.422]  They're saying it's a threat.
[01:17:26.922 --> 01:17:33.667]  And meanwhile, in the very sector where most of this is happening, they're saying, stand down!
[01:17:33.747 --> 01:17:42.713]  Now folks, that shows they could care less, or they're willing to have this happen in America, and of course take all of our rights when it happens, but the border will still stay open.
[01:17:44.334 --> 01:17:47.096]  This is absolutely unbelievable!
[01:17:47.276 --> 01:17:48.397]  It is incredible, isn't it?
[01:17:48.858 --> 01:17:50.739]  Like I tell you though, every single day here,
[01:17:51.397 --> 01:17:55.099]  Every day here, something happens that I have uttered those words.
[01:17:55.319 --> 01:18:01.862]  So you've said this is the policy is to get rid of our borders under CAFTA, that is the bridge to the FTAA.
[01:18:01.882 --> 01:18:06.124]  And I know you're very busy, sir, but I wanted to get in with you to the FTAA.
[01:18:06.164 --> 01:18:10.646]  You said you just left a meeting a few minutes before you got here and learned some of the things.
[01:18:10.766 --> 01:18:12.787]  Is there any way to keep you six, seven more minutes?
[01:18:13.887 --> 01:18:14.327]  You bet.
[01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:16.748]  But that's about all I can do.
[01:18:16.808 --> 01:18:18.409]  We've got a short little break.
[01:18:18.429 --> 01:18:20.309]  We'll come back for just a couple minutes on the other side.
[01:18:20.469 --> 01:18:21.190]  Very quickly.
[01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:23.090]  And just tell us what was in this meeting.
[01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.631]  And we appreciate you joining us so much, sir.
[01:18:26.071 --> 01:18:28.592]  Your website is Tancredo.house.gov.
[01:18:28.932 --> 01:18:33.493]  Tancredo is spelled T-A-N-C-R-E-D-O.house.gov.
[01:18:34.314 --> 01:18:35.954]  And the American people want it.
[01:18:36.074 --> 01:18:37.175]  It's in the Constitution.
[01:18:37.775 --> 01:18:39.936]  But we can't have our borders controlled.
[01:18:39.996 --> 01:18:41.296]  And Bush wants total amnesty.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:42.922]  Along with the Democrats.
[01:18:43.022 --> 01:18:47.311]  Now it's time for conservatives to stop putting up with this garbage!
[01:18:48.733 --> 01:18:49.775]  It's worse than garbage.
[01:18:49.815 --> 01:18:50.637]  You know what it is.
[01:18:50.657 --> 01:18:53.503]  We'll be right back with a congressman who's on a deadline.
[01:18:53.523 --> 01:18:54.104]  We appreciate it.

[01:23:01.989 --> 01:23:04.730]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:10.271]  On the final second of the congressman staying late with us, we really appreciate it.
[01:23:10.311 --> 01:23:22.054]  Imagine, putting out the terror alerts so that we know Cheshiers came across, they're gonna slaughter a school, 600 dead in Russia, and then meanwhile, Border Patrol, stand down!
[01:23:22.194 --> 01:23:28.296]  And then they're told, exing as the congressman said, where they can look one direction but not the other and have to watch illegals go by.
[01:23:28.936 --> 01:23:32.333]  I mean, this is the official policy!
[01:23:33.177 --> 01:23:43.120]  But boy, the cops are going to pull you over in Iowa, or Texas, or, you know, in the middle of nowhere, Arizona, and up, you know, North Arizona, and I'm going to search your car!
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:44.500]  It happens to everybody.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:47.041]  Well, things changed after 9-11.
[01:23:47.441 --> 01:23:49.121]  The feds are paying for checkpoints everywhere.
[01:23:49.141 --> 01:23:49.561]  It's a joke.
[01:23:49.901 --> 01:23:59.504]  Congressman, getting back into the free trade area of the Americas, and anything else on the situation with how dangerous this is with the border.
[01:24:00.359 --> 01:24:11.350]  Yeah, well there, as you probably know, there is an attempt by the administration to bring forward the next iteration of NAFTA, which is called CAFTA, which is the Central American Free Trade Agreement.
[01:24:11.990 --> 01:24:15.494]  That will be followed eventually by the Free Trade of the Americas.
[01:24:15.654 --> 01:24:18.877]  All of these things will be, they are on deck.
[01:24:19.137 --> 01:24:24.863]  Now, there is a great deal of opposition developing here, more so than I've ever seen before.
[01:24:25.583 --> 01:24:30.326]  to implementation of these arrangements, but they're going to push them as hard as they possibly can.
[01:24:30.486 --> 01:24:32.648]  They might tag them on to a general spending bill.
[01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:35.269]  I mean, it's like a 93-94 with NAFTA.
[01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:36.470]  That's exactly right.
[01:24:36.670 --> 01:24:48.178]  And I've never seen the administration so... They haven't put this much pressure on people since that other debacle called the Medicare-slash-prescription-drug bill.
[01:24:48.518 --> 01:24:51.920]  Now tell people... You just came from a meeting, huh?
[01:24:52.281 --> 01:24:52.841]  Yes, I did.
[01:24:54.282 --> 01:25:17.489]  I just came from a meeting with four of the members of Congress in which we had three experts from various legal branches around here that had given us just a wealth of information about CAFTA and about some of the problems inherent in it, not the least of which is the fact that the adjudication of any problem would go not to an American court but to a tribunal established under CAFTA.
[01:25:18.649 --> 01:25:22.570]  And that tribunal's decision, by the way, not an American court
[01:25:23.789 --> 01:25:31.695]  But this tribunal, the decision of the tribunal based upon whatever kinds of information provided, would be binding on us.
[01:25:32.035 --> 01:25:39.661]  Even if it were to require American taxpayers to pay damages, let's say.
[01:25:39.741 --> 01:25:42.163]  So it's basically like a WTO in the EU?
[01:25:42.663 --> 01:25:47.867]  Oh yes, it is, but it makes it even... And you know, they give an example of what happened.
[01:25:48.047 --> 01:25:52.410]  This actually is a case occurred, believe this or not, under NAFTA.
[01:25:54.062 --> 01:26:01.405]  There was a Canadian firm that was just like a huge mortuary firm.
[01:26:01.445 --> 01:26:02.706]  They only had lots and lots of them.
[01:26:02.786 --> 01:26:08.288]  And they came into the United States and they did a lot of things that were against the law.
[01:26:08.308 --> 01:26:10.309]  They violated the United States law.
[01:26:10.349 --> 01:26:18.633]  They put a lot of mortuaries out of business and were sued in the United States.
[01:26:19.493 --> 01:26:22.855]  They were found guilty in a court in Mississippi.
[01:26:23.908 --> 01:26:39.053]  They not only appealed that ruling, but then they in turn sued us and were awarded $600 million dollars by this other court, by this tribunal.
[01:26:39.693 --> 01:26:41.534]  Okay, so we're talking about globalization.
[01:26:41.554 --> 01:26:43.795]  You were trying to get into how you were pressured when I interrupted you.
[01:26:43.815 --> 01:26:44.555]  How are they pressuring?
[01:26:45.433 --> 01:26:47.634]  Oh brother, well, it's just called lobbying.
[01:26:47.734 --> 01:27:02.982]  You know, they stand, there's a, every time you walk across the street to vote, there are three or four guys from the White House, they're standing there, you know, down at the bottom of the stairs, pigeonholing members, asking them to come over and talk to you about NAFTA, I mean CAFTA.
[01:27:03.722 --> 01:27:12.647]  And then they will go to the leadership, the Speaker of the House, the Speaker will call you in, the Majority Leader calls you in,
[01:27:14.088 --> 01:27:15.969]  Eventually, you may get a call from the President.
[01:27:16.049 --> 01:27:23.011]  Once this thing actually gets to the floor, or as it approaches that, you will get a call from the President of the United States if you're still wavering.
[01:27:23.071 --> 01:27:25.032]  Now, I want people to understand, no more borders.
[01:27:25.372 --> 01:27:28.693]  They're already building the giant NAFTA highway right outside Austin.
[01:27:29.433 --> 01:27:30.593]  Everything will come through.
[01:27:30.673 --> 01:27:31.734]  It's a total joke.
[01:27:32.194 --> 01:27:35.895]  Merging our militaries, merging our law enforcement, merging the databases.
[01:27:36.595 --> 01:27:38.656]  All of this is merging our social security.
[01:27:38.996 --> 01:27:41.477]  It's already happening, is it not, Congressman?
[01:27:41.497 --> 01:27:54.041]  It is absolutely happening, and I know, you know, there's a tendency for people to hear this kind of thing and discount it because it's, oh, too bizarre, too dramatic, but it's the fact.
[01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:57.151]  And then meanwhile, the Border Patrol's been ordered to stand down.
[01:27:57.211 --> 01:27:58.792]  Is anybody going to get in trouble for this?
[01:27:58.832 --> 01:28:05.535]  I mean, I know Bush ordered it, but at least if this Section Chief gets fired, others will be scared to engage in treason.
[01:28:05.835 --> 01:28:10.057]  Nicely, he's not going to get fired because he's doing what the administration wants.
[01:28:10.157 --> 01:28:12.138]  He'll probably end up being Border Patrol Chief someday.
[01:28:12.158 --> 01:28:12.818]  That's exactly right.
[01:28:12.938 --> 01:28:17.060]  He is fulfilling his responsibility as he sees it under this administration.
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.921]  And so, no, he's not going to get fired.
[01:28:20.780 --> 01:28:22.281]  Congressman, unbelievable.
[01:28:22.681 --> 01:28:24.362]  Is there any pressure we can put on people?
[01:28:25.743 --> 01:28:27.364]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:28:28.004 --> 01:28:33.207]  I guarantee you, you're the great megaphone that we all need around here to let people know what the concerns are.
[01:28:33.247 --> 01:28:35.148]  Have them do what they've been doing, Carl.
[01:28:35.168 --> 01:28:36.548]  Because it is changing things.
[01:28:37.049 --> 01:28:41.071]  And you're about to go on the floor and unveil some new legislation.
[01:28:41.131 --> 01:28:43.072]  Yes, I'm going to go on the floor in just a few hours.
[01:28:43.272 --> 01:28:44.192]  Thank you, Congressman.
[01:28:44.232 --> 01:28:45.013]  Thank you so much.
[01:28:46.345 --> 01:28:49.354]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:50.256 --> 01:28:52.964]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:57.197 --> 01:29:02.701]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:29:02.861 --> 01:29:03.922]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:29:04.042 --> 01:29:04.923]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:29:05.043 --> 01:29:07.885]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:29:08.065 --> 01:29:12.948]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:29:13.188 --> 01:29:14.309]  Check out this new product.
[01:29:14.429 --> 01:29:17.331]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:29:17.711 --> 01:29:21.414]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:29:21.554 --> 01:29:21.714]  Look.
[01:29:21.914 --> 01:29:24.256]  The creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.
[01:29:24.316 --> 01:29:29.119]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[01:29:29.419 --> 01:29:32.541]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[01:29:32.661 --> 01:29:38.064]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:29:38.164 --> 01:29:38.925]  Try No-BO.
[01:29:39.045 --> 01:29:40.025]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:29:41.186 --> 01:29:41.526]  No B.O.

[01:31:45.030 --> 01:31:45.230]  Call today.
[01:31:45.250 --> 01:31:49.332]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:49.352 --> 01:31:51.213]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:11.703 --> 01:32:31.976]  In the 1950s, the European Union came out and said, the banking industry behind it, Bilderberg Group, said, these documents have all been made public in the British archives, been in the BBC, the people of Europe will not take giving up their sovereignty and their currencies and their freedoms.
[01:32:33.137 --> 01:32:37.980]  So what we're going to do is we're going to call it an economic community and claim it's going to be good financially.
[01:32:39.818 --> 01:32:51.101]  But really, we're going to set up a government where there's no juries, no freedoms, no due process, no private property rights, unless you're a select elite that controls the government and basically feeds on the public.
[01:32:52.841 --> 01:32:53.641]  And now what's happened?
[01:32:53.921 --> 01:32:55.962]  Fifty years later, you've got the EU.
[01:32:56.262 --> 01:32:58.763]  They're arresting people for criticizing the government.
[01:32:58.783 --> 01:33:00.983]  They're arresting people for saying the word homosexual.
[01:33:01.623 --> 01:33:02.864]  I mean, major reporters.
[01:33:02.924 --> 01:33:04.604]  You're not even allowed to say that word.
[01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:08.291]  They're arresting people that criticize Nazis?
[01:33:08.331 --> 01:33:10.615]  They're arresting people who are Nazis?
[01:33:12.098 --> 01:33:12.639]  Oh yes!
[01:33:15.003 --> 01:33:19.271]  You put the Pope's head on a Nazi, which he was a Nazi, and they come and arrest you!
[01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:23.041]  You are a Nazi, which I say you have the right to be a Nazi.
[01:33:23.602 --> 01:33:25.322]  Or, you know, white supremacists.
[01:33:25.342 --> 01:33:26.043]  They come arrest you.
[01:33:26.263 --> 01:33:31.586]  You're an American who's a white supremacist who writes a book saying 2 million Jews died, not 6 million.
[01:33:31.986 --> 01:33:33.286]  They come over and arrest you!
[01:33:33.527 --> 01:33:39.830]  Now whether 10 billion Jews or 5 Jews died, the number's under 6 million.
[01:33:39.850 --> 01:33:41.050]  It doesn't matter.
[01:33:41.631 --> 01:33:42.931]  It's wrong to kill people.
[01:33:42.951 --> 01:33:44.352]  Hitler did target Jews.
[01:33:44.392 --> 01:33:48.114]  The point is, is that you take somebody's free speech, everybody loses it.
[01:33:49.818 --> 01:33:51.538]  Both of you agree or disagree with those views?
[01:33:51.958 --> 01:33:57.079]  I mean, we've had people arrested in America for books they've written that have made it to Germany, and then they come and arrest you!
[01:33:57.379 --> 01:34:03.021]  I guess Germany could come arrest me, because from the historical evidence I've seen, it was under 6 million Jews!
[01:34:04.121 --> 01:34:05.501]  Now, I think Hitler was horrible!
[01:34:05.941 --> 01:34:07.441]  I'm criticized by people for that!
[01:34:08.522 --> 01:34:09.802]  But I guess I'm evil!
[01:34:11.002 --> 01:34:15.363]  And by the way, that whole 6 million number started because at Auschwitz, the Russians put up 6 million.
[01:34:16.357 --> 01:34:18.538]  It was originally at that one camp, they claim.
[01:34:18.998 --> 01:34:27.242]  Of course, only about a million people ever went through it, so then they had to say, oh no, it was 400,000 here, 500,000 here, and then, well, you said 6 million.
[01:34:27.403 --> 01:34:28.823]  Oh no, we mean everywhere!
[01:34:28.903 --> 01:34:36.587]  So, again, they're discrediting the whole thing, and Hitler did do those bad things, because they want to keep telling that lie.
[01:34:36.627 --> 01:34:41.430]  But, you're a historian, and you say that, um, it was more like a couple million?
[01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:43.110]  And again, what does it matter?
[01:34:43.130 --> 01:34:43.791]  A couple million?
[01:34:43.831 --> 01:34:44.291]  Six million?
[01:34:45.691 --> 01:34:47.213]  Kill five people or a million people.
[01:34:47.373 --> 01:34:47.993]  It's wrong.
[01:34:49.114 --> 01:34:52.117]  And, you know, they arrest historians like Ernst Zundel.
[01:34:53.057 --> 01:34:54.378]  I'm getting sidetracked.
[01:34:54.418 --> 01:35:02.405]  The point here is, and he's up in Canada, about to be extradited, the point here is this is what the EU, how it was set up.
[01:35:03.926 --> 01:35:05.768]  Oh, you criticize Muslims, you're being arrested.
[01:35:06.168 --> 01:35:09.971]  Oh, you criticize Muslims, criticize people for their religion, we're going to arrest the Muslims.
[01:35:10.856 --> 01:35:20.003]  Paul Watson lives over there under this, where Scotland Yard has its hate crimes unit that arrests hundreds a night sometimes in their raids.
[01:35:20.043 --> 01:35:38.538]  BBC headline, Hundreds Arrested in Nighttime Raid, for what they'd said, why a neighbor heard them call an Erebus mean term, for British farmers fined three thousand pounds because they hauled French strawberries crap.
[01:35:39.839 --> 01:35:40.600]  That was the headline.
[01:35:42.461 --> 01:35:48.447]  Farmers bought an ad and said, our strawberries are delicious and wonderful, and theirs are crap.
[01:35:48.647 --> 01:35:49.227]  I mean, big deal.
[01:35:49.628 --> 01:35:50.909]  Oh, that's xenophobic!
[01:35:50.929 --> 01:35:53.311]  You're just white people talking about white people.
[01:35:53.351 --> 01:35:54.813]  Well, it wasn't a racial issue.
[01:35:54.853 --> 01:35:56.975]  It was, hey, our stuff's better than yours!
[01:35:57.275 --> 01:35:58.416]  Buy our strawberries!
[01:35:58.837 --> 01:35:59.337]  Oh, no!
[01:35:59.557 --> 01:36:01.059]  You sell our produce is better!
[01:36:01.519 --> 01:36:02.640]  Oh, giant fines!
[01:36:02.660 --> 01:36:03.921]  We'll arrest you next time!
[01:36:03.941 --> 01:36:07.525]  I mean, folks, this is what's going on.
[01:36:08.657 --> 01:36:10.479]  And that's the Pan-American Union.
[01:36:10.540 --> 01:36:11.941]  That's what they're doing!
[01:36:11.961 --> 01:36:13.623]  We'll be under international law!
[01:36:15.645 --> 01:36:20.250]  And you heard Tom Tancredo talking about that, and our borders standing down, and all this is going on.
[01:36:21.591 --> 01:36:22.693]  It's a nightmare!
[01:36:23.674 --> 01:36:25.616]  It's a nightmare, ladies and gentlemen!
[01:36:28.641 --> 01:36:38.409]  And to do a correction, they have ordered an arrest of the IndyMedia site owners, but since they live in Brazil, it's kind of hard for them to do, but they're going to Brazilian courts now saying you're not allowed to put the Pope's head on a Nazi.
[01:36:39.150 --> 01:36:40.651]  You see how that works left?
[01:36:41.352 --> 01:36:49.699]  You take people's rights to say that, you know, Jews didn't die, or this many died, because it sounds reasonable?
[01:36:49.759 --> 01:36:51.600]  Well then now you lose your rights, see?
[01:36:51.981 --> 01:36:54.783]  This is happening everywhere, and it's happening in America.
[01:36:55.686 --> 01:36:57.928]  There was the one case we interviewed the fellow.
[01:36:57.988 --> 01:37:00.249]  The black man attacked the white woman at the football game.
[01:37:00.270 --> 01:37:00.970]  He was the coach.
[01:37:01.350 --> 01:37:02.251]  She was the photographer.
[01:37:02.271 --> 01:37:06.074]  Started screaming slangs at the whites.
[01:37:06.574 --> 01:37:08.676]  The white husband sent something back to the black guy.
[01:37:08.756 --> 01:37:09.577]  He gets arrested.
[01:37:09.877 --> 01:37:10.617]  She gets fired.
[01:37:12.679 --> 01:37:15.701]  You see, the physical assault wasn't bad.
[01:37:15.741 --> 01:37:18.003]  It's admitted he was choking her with the strap of her camera.
[01:37:18.706 --> 01:37:20.228]  Throwing a fit because he lost the game?
[01:37:20.509 --> 01:37:21.270]  That's okay.
[01:37:21.570 --> 01:37:23.052]  But don't you say that N-word.
[01:37:23.253 --> 01:37:23.673]  And it's okay.
[01:37:23.713 --> 01:37:25.736]  See, this is where it's all going, folks.
[01:37:26.036 --> 01:37:32.025]  Where you go to a Bush protest, and there's 500 Bush supporters, and one guy has a sign saying, I love John Kerry.
[01:37:32.365 --> 01:37:32.746]  Boom!
[01:37:32.926 --> 01:37:33.387]  Arrested.
[01:37:34.153 --> 01:37:34.973]  And the court rules?
[01:37:35.013 --> 01:37:36.614]  Hey, it's selectively enforced.
[01:37:36.914 --> 01:37:40.475]  We can do what we want, when we want, but the border's gonna stay wide open.
[01:37:40.875 --> 01:37:42.116]  And you gotta give all your rights up.
[01:37:42.436 --> 01:37:47.618]  Paul, I'm ranting and raving here, but you live in what's now being absorbed into Europe.
[01:37:47.978 --> 01:37:49.198]  Am I exaggerating here?
[01:37:50.318 --> 01:37:51.159]  Well, no, you're not.
[01:37:51.399 --> 01:38:00.602]  And the thing that galls me about the hate speech within the EU, where people are labeled Nazis if they question, you know, how many Jews died,
[01:38:02.138 --> 01:38:17.021]  Even the Chinese government admits that Mao killed 30 million people in the famine, the so-called Great Leap Forward, and then a further 10 million in the Cultural Revolution, the purges, the political enemies of the government.
[01:38:17.801 --> 01:38:25.463]  And yet, in the centre of my city where I live, they can open a restaurant called Mao's Restaurant.
[01:38:26.789 --> 01:38:35.379]  Where all the waiters wear pretty little pictures of Chairman Mao on their uniforms, and the decor is kitted out in pictures of Mao.
[01:38:35.499 --> 01:38:39.404]  They have one of those in Denver, very popular, four-star restaurant.
[01:38:39.825 --> 01:38:42.428]  And here in Austin, my wife worked there in college.
[01:38:43.701 --> 01:38:45.123]  A popular toy store.
[01:38:45.543 --> 01:38:47.385]  She went in to buy some toys a few months ago.
[01:38:47.425 --> 01:38:48.386]  Didn't buy anything, by the way.
[01:38:48.826 --> 01:38:54.092]  And there was an entire section of Soviet leaders, and it was all, it was communist propaganda.
[01:38:54.472 --> 01:38:55.673]  How great they are!
[01:38:55.894 --> 01:38:59.417]  This is, these are the equivalent of selling little Hitler dolls!
[01:39:00.538 --> 01:39:03.782]  And my wife said, you know, he, uh, Mao killed 50 million people.
[01:39:04.645 --> 01:39:05.385]  You're saying 40.
[01:39:06.165 --> 01:39:08.406]  But conservatively, you're right, 40 million.
[01:39:08.486 --> 01:39:11.407]  Again, we're not lessening it by saying it's 40 instead of 50.
[01:39:11.727 --> 01:39:12.507]  No one really knows.
[01:39:12.527 --> 01:39:21.850]  The Chinese government says that, yes, 30 million died in one of their forcing people off the land into the compact cities for control to redistribute wealth.
[01:39:22.930 --> 01:39:24.131]  But you're absolutely right, Paul.
[01:39:24.851 --> 01:39:28.232]  And she said, that's offensive.
[01:39:28.732 --> 01:39:31.173]  And the lady said, well, a lot of us like Mao.
[01:39:31.413 --> 01:39:31.953]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:39:32.953 --> 01:39:34.874]  Well, it's just the cultural ignorance.
[01:39:35.255 --> 01:39:45.741]  You know, if I opened a restaurant called Hitler's with swastikas on the outside and, you know, the staff dressed in Waffen-SS uniforms, would people go in that restaurant?
[01:39:45.801 --> 01:39:51.785]  No, but the cultural ignorance is to the level where the newspaper review in the local paper can read.
[01:39:52.549 --> 01:39:57.291]  He may have been a brutal dictator that killed tens of millions of people, but the food tastes great.
[01:39:57.771 --> 01:40:04.754]  And the, um, liberal trendies go in there and it's, you know, the most popular restaurant newly opened in the center of the town.
[01:40:04.954 --> 01:40:07.335]  You mean there was actually a newspaper review that said that?
[01:40:08.075 --> 01:40:08.355]  Yes.
[01:40:09.055 --> 01:40:10.196]  Did you post that?
[01:40:11.236 --> 01:40:12.297]  No, but I can dig it out.
[01:40:12.397 --> 01:40:15.938]  Oh, absolutely, and merge it with the one out of Denver my wife did.
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:19.321]  Yeah, they've actually got a website now as well.
[01:40:19.902 --> 01:40:22.743]  Well, Paul, get that up and then see how sick that is?
[01:40:22.983 --> 01:40:24.724]  He may have killed millions, but so what?
[01:40:24.764 --> 01:40:26.005]  It's delicious food.
[01:40:27.145 --> 01:40:28.766]  Well, you ought to start Hitler's then.
[01:40:30.327 --> 01:40:31.888]  It just shows the cultural ignorance.
[01:40:32.428 --> 01:40:32.848]  Oh, it is.
[01:40:32.888 --> 01:40:33.809]  I'm so sick of it.
[01:40:35.630 --> 01:40:37.311]  But, uh, continue, Paul.
[01:40:37.351 --> 01:40:37.571]  Sorry.
[01:40:38.873 --> 01:40:47.155]  So yeah, I mean, it ties into the hate speech with the EU, where they arrest people who question the amount of millions of Jews that died.
[01:40:48.675 --> 01:40:50.296]  So again, it's a double standard.
[01:40:50.356 --> 01:40:54.357]  It's just identifying a political enemy and clamping down on it.
[01:40:54.397 --> 01:41:04.239]  I mean, you had the man, Robert Page, was it, on the show, the former presenter of the BBC programme, saying that in a speech
[01:41:05.451 --> 01:41:08.632]  Farmers deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[01:41:09.332 --> 01:41:11.453]  Scotland Yard were called and he was arrested.
[01:41:11.473 --> 01:41:31.679]  And this is a guy who had a 10-year talk TV show, he gives a speech not even bashing those groups, saying we deserve the same rights and the head of Scotland Yard diversity unit, you're right it's not hate crimes, it's diversity unit, going from where we have this posted, said that you're not allowed to use that word, but selectively they decide.
[01:41:32.539 --> 01:41:34.800]  The word in the medical handbook is illegal.
[01:41:36.770 --> 01:41:38.972]  I don't think people get this, Paul.
[01:41:39.032 --> 01:41:39.732]  How serious.
[01:41:39.952 --> 01:41:41.153]  But listen, you heard the congressman.
[01:41:41.353 --> 01:41:46.197]  We're going to be under all these same rules under CAFTA and the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:41:46.237 --> 01:41:47.718]  We're going into the American Union.
[01:41:48.138 --> 01:41:50.040]  It's all over Mexican and Canadian papers.
[01:41:50.060 --> 01:41:50.860]  We've been posting it.
[01:41:51.081 --> 01:41:52.261]  The Canadians are panicking.
[01:41:52.301 --> 01:41:53.582]  The Mexican government loves it.
[01:41:53.762 --> 01:41:54.563]  Their people hate it.
[01:41:54.903 --> 01:41:57.785]  And the average American sucking their thumb will laugh at us, Paul!
[01:41:59.086 --> 01:42:02.529]  Were the British 10 years ago laughing about the EU?
[01:42:02.569 --> 01:42:03.910]  Were they still denying it existed?
[01:42:05.467 --> 01:42:07.428]  Yeah, they were, and the only... Idiots!
[01:42:07.809 --> 01:42:21.658]  The only, um, basically the last vestige before total EU takeover is the British pound, because it was Tony Blair's mandate to sacrifice the British pound and bring in Britain under the single European convention.
[01:42:21.678 --> 01:42:22.239]  So, I've seen it.
[01:42:22.279 --> 01:42:27.923]  You have the same propaganda where the EU exists, we're taking your rights, but if you say the EU exists, it doesn't exist, and you're crazy.
[01:42:28.723 --> 01:42:29.364]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:42:29.384 --> 01:42:37.091]  And across Europe, in places like Germany and France, the economies are just collapsing since they introduced the single European currency.
[01:42:37.291 --> 01:42:39.793]  But the bankers are centralizing control.
[01:42:40.734 --> 01:42:41.174]  Exactly.
[01:42:41.234 --> 01:42:47.300]  And it's all in store for you as well with the Amero, Americo dollar, whatever they want to call it.
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:52.004]  And you know, the day those are issued, I'll get all these calls going, you were right, you were right.
[01:42:52.024 --> 01:42:54.026]  We're talking four or five years away, boys and girls.
[01:42:55.805 --> 01:42:58.467]  And of course it will all be voluntary at first.
[01:42:58.487 --> 01:43:00.809]  They'll phase it in alongside the dollar.
[01:43:00.829 --> 01:43:03.911]  But they'll make it to where that's worth something and the dollar's worth nothing, yeah?
[01:43:04.892 --> 01:43:07.674]  Yeah, that's what they did in several European countries.
[01:43:07.714 --> 01:43:14.019]  They phased it in, get people acclimatized to it, and then it totally takes over, single currency.
[01:43:14.360 --> 01:43:15.921]  And I mean that's what Bilderberg planned.
[01:43:16.559 --> 01:43:25.041]  At their very first meeting, the BBC uncovered the documents which said we want a single European currency to dovetail with this free trade bloc.
[01:43:25.161 --> 01:43:25.521]  And that was 1954.
[01:43:25.761 --> 01:43:38.024]  That's right, and then, you know, the BBC can report again last year that anybody who talks about Bilderberg is in with McVeigh and Bin Laden, when their own colleagues had previously reported that.
[01:43:38.104 --> 01:43:44.766]  Well, I've been attacked by the New York Times, it doesn't exist, while CNN's running reports about Alex for world government, but that's good.
[01:43:46.331 --> 01:44:00.777]  Yeah, and they did kind of spin it by saying that Bilderberg themselves see themselves as a world government conspiracy, as do the conspiracy theories, but it's all a big laugh.
[01:44:01.397 --> 01:44:02.878]  That was basically the spin.
[01:44:03.498 --> 01:44:13.242]  And that in reality, even though they've got the power to make this policy, such as the single European country, and it happens, and yet they haven't got any power.
[01:44:13.482 --> 01:44:14.723]  So it's double think again.
[01:44:16.525 --> 01:44:17.666]  Well, it's unbelievable.
[01:44:17.726 --> 01:44:19.607]  And they're arresting protesters over there, here.
[01:44:19.627 --> 01:44:21.067]  They're doing it here, selectively.
[01:44:21.688 --> 01:44:24.369]  Our police are being taught torture tactics on protesters.
[01:44:24.389 --> 01:44:27.171]  We've got video... I mean, it is classical tyranny, Paul.
[01:44:27.391 --> 01:44:31.613]  Let's get into Newsweek, and then I want to get into eugenics in this country.
[01:44:31.693 --> 01:44:37.696]  New admissions of hundreds of thousands being forcibly sterilized viciously, here, secretly, by our government.
[01:44:37.916 --> 01:44:39.997]  How could hundreds of thousands be secretly sterilized?
[01:44:40.298 --> 01:44:41.378]  Why, we'd learn of it!
[01:44:41.598 --> 01:44:43.259]  Nothing that evil could be kept secret!
[01:44:43.679 --> 01:44:44.740]  Boulderdash, folks!
[01:44:45.300 --> 01:44:48.261]  Stuff that makes that look tame is going on right now.
[01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:49.662]  We're warning you.
[01:44:49.942 --> 01:44:50.942]  Will you face it?
[01:44:51.263 --> 01:44:52.403]  Do you love this country?
[01:44:52.443 --> 01:44:53.424]  Do you love England?
[01:44:53.704 --> 01:44:57.565]  Do you love your own sovereign nations listening on all seven continents right now?
[01:44:57.645 --> 01:45:01.547]  Yes, we even have listeners in Antarctica who want to see how to make Myrtle Weather Station.
[01:45:02.107 --> 01:45:03.368]  Paul, let's get into Newsweek.
[01:45:03.568 --> 01:45:05.108]  Very sophisticated propaganda.
[01:45:06.269 --> 01:45:11.151]  Well, isn't it rich that we're going to be hearing about this retraction
[01:45:11.812 --> 01:45:23.321]  For weeks, and yet, there's no retraction when they say they captured Mr. Al-Qaeda number three, and it turns out to be a nobody with a similar name, spelt differently.
[01:45:24.241 --> 01:45:27.083]  In every major newspaper, where's the retraction on that?
[01:45:27.584 --> 01:45:30.546]  Which, I need to get into, in depth on that later.
[01:45:31.247 --> 01:45:41.054]  And, uh, yeah, this newsweek is basically, it's a government PR campaign in the same way they leaked the Bush AWOL story and set that strawman up to knock it down.
[01:45:41.756 --> 01:45:46.258]  So they pick a minutiae that's false and then use it to try and discredit the whole argument?
[01:45:46.379 --> 01:45:51.041]  Actually, the book did not go down the toilet, it was just in the toilet.
[01:45:51.881 --> 01:45:55.143]  And I knew they'd do that, and I actually heard a national host saying that yesterday.
[01:45:55.623 --> 01:45:58.685]  Two weeks ago, we had one of the chief interrogators, U.S.
[01:45:58.765 --> 01:46:09.891]  Army, he quit and said, we're doing all of this, we have all the people being released saying this, we have the government admitting they're doing a lot of this, we have hundreds of articles, but then Newsweek
[01:46:10.868 --> 01:46:13.870]  It's your fault there were all these riots Newsweek, you're traitors!
[01:46:15.651 --> 01:46:22.134]  Well yeah, it's the attempt at reaffirming these kind of stereotypes that keep people locked in the same loop.
[01:46:22.154 --> 01:46:28.797]  Well what they do is retract real stories and they'll have one of their shills retract a real story and people will go, oh no that's retracted!
[01:46:30.258 --> 01:46:33.480]  Exactly, and the first stereotype is
[01:46:34.201 --> 01:46:37.845]  You know, our troops would never mistreat prisoners, as a matter of course.
[01:46:37.905 --> 01:46:40.027]  And if it does happen, it's just a few bad apples.
[01:46:40.107 --> 01:46:42.769]  And of course, that's what Abu Ghraib was all about.
[01:46:42.809 --> 01:46:44.831]  They knew the story was going to come out.
[01:46:45.472 --> 01:46:48.114]  And believe me, it's a lot worse than anything we saw.
[01:46:48.515 --> 01:46:51.277]  Those second set of photographs were never released.
[01:46:51.377 --> 01:46:53.720]  Only the Congressmen and Senators saw them.
[01:46:54.520 --> 01:46:56.222]  So, they knew it was going to come out.
[01:46:56.282 --> 01:46:59.145]  They had to get ahead of the story and steam valve it.
[01:46:59.893 --> 01:47:09.927]  Which is, you know, how they managed to spin raping children and torturing people to death into putting pillowcases on people's heads and embarrassing them.
[01:47:10.347 --> 01:47:13.171]  The Army's own report says all the things you just mentioned.
[01:47:13.872 --> 01:47:18.658]  Raping people with battery acid, all of this, but again, you're absolutely right, Paul.
[01:47:18.898 --> 01:47:21.281]  Well, it's the same thing with Bush and the National Guard documents.
[01:47:21.321 --> 01:47:32.195]  We have all the documents, the official documents, it's all in these AWOL, so they create false documents with a fake system, written in another year, on purpose, and release it to discredit.
[01:47:33.689 --> 01:47:42.736]  Yeah, and more than half of Americans would believe that, that Bush never went AWOL, he was a stand-up military guy and he's the perfect man to lead the global war on terror.
[01:47:42.956 --> 01:47:45.978]  I've heard him say on national news he was a fighter pilot in Vietnam!
[01:47:47.459 --> 01:47:48.180]  No, I'm serious.
[01:47:49.020 --> 01:47:50.501]  Same thing with Abu Ghraib.
[01:47:51.022 --> 01:47:58.127]  At least half or more of Americans would still think that it was all about putting pillow cases on people's heads.
[01:47:59.108 --> 01:48:01.790]  Again, it reaffirms the stereotype of
[01:48:02.774 --> 01:48:08.497]  A liberal media bias that hates America and lies about the war to try and make America look bad.
[01:48:08.557 --> 01:48:09.877]  Therefore, the war must be good.
[01:48:10.037 --> 01:48:13.098]  But under... Did you have this in the info page you built?
[01:48:13.118 --> 01:48:14.719]  Because I didn't have a chance to look at all of it this morning.
[01:48:14.739 --> 01:48:15.459]  It was so lengthy.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:26.524]  P-2-O-G, three years old, six billion a year, to go out and abuse Arabs, to enrage them, to make them fight more, to widen conflicts and to keep conflicts going.
[01:48:26.844 --> 01:48:28.125]  That's why they release it.
[01:48:28.865 --> 01:48:31.948]  Folks, they're releasing these prisoners who all go tell these stories.
[01:48:32.268 --> 01:48:34.870]  It's done by design to create outrage, Paul.
[01:48:36.051 --> 01:48:39.254]  Yeah, I've got the quote from the Asia Times.
[01:48:40.315 --> 01:48:57.449]  Rumsfeld's P2OG program would launch secret operations aimed at stimulating reactions among terrorists and states possessing weapons of mass destruction, meaning it would prod terrorist cells into action, thus exposing them to quick response attacks by U.S.
[01:48:57.489 --> 01:48:57.909]  forces.
[01:48:58.562 --> 01:49:00.063]  By killing their family members.
[01:49:01.083 --> 01:49:01.563]  Exactly.
[01:49:02.644 --> 01:49:14.969]  And again, the real evidence of this kind of desecration of the Muslim religion to then enrage the Arabs is published in European newspapers on a weekly basis almost.
[01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:23.353]  So, the Muslims see this and it further radicalizes, militarizes them to rise up against what they see as the Great Satan.
[01:49:24.154 --> 01:49:24.934]  When you can go back
[01:49:25.904 --> 01:49:30.967]  During the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan and the textbooks were given out by the U.S.
[01:49:31.027 --> 01:49:32.528]  government and they were radical.
[01:49:32.748 --> 01:49:34.989]  They sought to radicalize them in the first place.
[01:49:36.030 --> 01:49:40.292]  Well, they said that back in the 50s and 60s as a, quote, counterbalance against the communists.
[01:49:40.692 --> 01:49:44.654]  But the radical Muslims in don't have secular states.
[01:49:45.295 --> 01:49:45.955]  Paul, stay there.
[01:49:45.975 --> 01:49:49.137]  We'll continue with this and then get into the eugenics.
[01:49:49.197 --> 01:49:50.698]  And take your calls in the next hour.
[01:49:50.718 --> 01:49:50.778]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:50.798 --> 01:49:51.198]  PrisonBlind.tv.
[01:49:56.152 --> 01:50:00.494]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:50:00.694 --> 01:50:05.096]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:05.256 --> 01:50:09.618]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:09.658 --> 01:50:11.019]  The New World Order.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:12.761]  Hannah Murray.
[01:50:12.821 --> 01:50:17.047]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:17.087 --> 01:50:24.057]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:24.157 --> 01:50:26.180]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:26.561 --> 01:50:36.985]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:37.145 --> 01:50:42.527]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:51:12.418 --> 01:51:16.699]  It consists of parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.

[01:52:56.036 --> 01:52:56.898]  I think so.
[01:53:11.789 --> 01:53:19.051]  If this was a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.
[01:53:19.071 --> 01:53:21.571]  Hey, find that dictator quote online.
[01:53:21.591 --> 01:53:22.611]  I know it's on my website.
[01:53:23.211 --> 01:53:24.952]  John, running the show, but find it.
[01:53:25.092 --> 01:53:26.132]  The Bush dictator quote.
[01:53:27.212 --> 01:53:28.492]  And I want to play that for people.
[01:53:30.132 --> 01:53:31.593]  A lot of folks doubt he even said that.
[01:53:31.633 --> 01:53:32.593]  Yeah, he said it twice.
[01:53:33.093 --> 01:53:35.313]  Once on CNN and then once at a press conference.
[01:53:36.774 --> 01:53:39.174]  But he's our leader, our good Christian leader.
[01:53:40.345 --> 01:53:55.713]  Paul, before we get more into this Newsweek piece of propaganda and the eugenics and the economy and all of it and the calls in the next hour, tell folks about PrisonPlanet.tv and all the things that we offer there on the site now into its 13th or 14th month of operation.
[01:53:57.094 --> 01:53:59.755]  Well, it's the backbone of the website.
[01:53:59.855 --> 01:54:04.858]  Everything that we put out for free, which is obviously the vast majority of what we put out, is
[01:54:07.122 --> 01:54:09.943]  The foundation of it is prisonplanet.tv.

[01:54:27.430 --> 01:54:32.332]  We're in the process of going back to his old films, offering them in new formats.
[01:54:32.372 --> 01:54:34.693]  That's going to be taking place in the next few weeks.
[01:54:35.641 --> 01:54:45.426]  Um, Alex Jones Weekly Report every week from his TV show and all the best audio interviews from the Alex Jones Show, other e-books as well.

[01:54:51.670 --> 01:55:00.274]  Yeah, most of the services just to listen to a radio show are about twice that amount of money.
[01:55:00.294 --> 01:55:03.876]  And we've been authorized to post dozens of other great films as well, Paul.
[01:55:04.975 --> 01:55:30.101]  Yeah, we've got, um, Daniel Hopsicker's film, we've got George Humphrey's film about 9-11, um, Eric Huffschmidt's film, um, basically dozens of those now as well, different films about different issues from different political perspectives, you know, we've got left-wing films like Outfoxed, um, ones made on the right, um, like Brainwashing 101 about, um,
[01:55:32.350 --> 01:55:33.991]  Liberal bias in universities.

[01:55:50.620 --> 01:55:59.465]  PrisonPlanet.tv folks, or call, feel free to get a hard copy of any of my films, or the other films I carry, or my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.

[01:56:25.084 --> 01:56:27.706]  Paul, anything else on this quote Newsweek retraction?
[01:56:27.726 --> 01:56:29.247]  They don't really even say what they're retracting.
[01:56:29.267 --> 01:56:30.789]  I mean,
[01:56:31.627 --> 01:56:33.428]  Any other comments on that before we end the shower?
[01:56:34.649 --> 01:56:43.815]  Yeah, I mean another goal is it discredits any previous stories that were similar to this story even though they're, you know, 100% factual.
[01:56:44.116 --> 01:56:53.542]  Dozens of internees from Guantanamo have gone public with the evidence of, you know, how they use this disgrace of their religion as a means of interrogation.
[01:56:54.002 --> 01:56:56.404]  We've got articles linked on that on the website.
[01:56:57.290 --> 01:57:06.358]  And of course how they use prostitutes to do acts which we can't even talk about on a family-orientated show, but they'd be in major newspapers, you can read about them.
[01:57:07.159 --> 01:57:17.389]  And then, you know, people like Rick Barkus, who was called too nice because he refused to engage in this desecration of the religion or torture, and was fired for doing so.
[01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:19.851]  And that's BBC.
[01:57:20.311 --> 01:57:21.853]  And he was the head of the camp!
[01:57:22.905 --> 01:57:26.027]  And what he said is, I'll have to resign if you don't stop this.
[01:57:26.387 --> 01:57:27.528]  And they said, fine, you're gone.
[01:57:28.408 --> 01:57:34.091]  Yep, and any future stories that come out that are similar... We just had a top interrogator quit and say all this!
[01:57:34.672 --> 01:57:37.894]  Alberto Gonzalez's own memos say they're doing this!
[01:57:38.814 --> 01:57:38.974]  Huh!
[01:57:39.374 --> 01:57:40.375]  I mean, come on!
[01:57:40.775 --> 01:57:42.296]  We'll be right back with a third hour.
[01:57:42.356 --> 01:57:42.776]  Stay with us.
[01:57:52.532 --> 01:57:56.696]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:57.357 --> 01:57:58.198]  You want answers?
[01:57:58.938 --> 01:57:59.839]  Well, so does he.
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:04.184]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:04.704 --> 01:58:08.768]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:25.995 --> 01:58:32.857]  Welcome, my friends, into the third and final hour of this Tuesday, May 17, 2005, Transmission Against Tyranny.
[01:58:34.437 --> 01:58:39.758]  I'm your info warrior right here in my little command base in Central Texas.
[01:58:39.778 --> 01:58:43.119]  You're out there in your area fighting as well, and I commend you.
[01:58:43.639 --> 01:58:47.260]  Riding shotgun with us for the rest of this broadcast is Paul Watson.
[01:58:49.071 --> 01:58:52.534]  My great webmaster at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:52.974 --> 01:58:55.076]  His brother does InfoWars.net.
[01:58:55.637 --> 01:59:01.041]  And my wife and Ryan Slickheisen do InfoWars.com.
[01:59:02.422 --> 01:59:05.085]  And help update the other sites as well.
[01:59:05.265 --> 01:59:06.946]  We're talking about just a plethora of news.
[01:59:07.266 --> 01:59:08.868]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:12.705 --> 01:59:23.288]  Paul, your government says, brace for terror attack any minute, but they leave the tunnel open to France to let thousands of Muslims a night, I've seen the broadcast from England, pour through unmolested.
[01:59:23.989 --> 01:59:31.991]  Over here, our government's telling the Border Patrol to stand down, that's the White House telling them, but terrorists are about to attack any minute, we better give all our liberties up.
[01:59:32.391 --> 01:59:36.873]  And Congressman Tom Sangrito, the head of the Border Caucus Immigration Committee,
[01:59:37.928 --> 01:59:41.429]  Just said it's about a new world order about the Pan American Union.
[01:59:41.449 --> 01:59:43.210]  I mean, people have got to stop denying this.
[01:59:44.591 --> 01:59:45.271]  Well, exactly.
[01:59:45.311 --> 01:59:58.296]  And again, as in your country, in this country, the foundation of not only keeping people in fear, but convincing them in the first place that this whole war on terror even exists is fake terror alerts.
[01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:07.671]  Of which we just had another in this country right before the election with the so-called Ryerson Ring which was set to attack London.
[02:00:08.172 --> 02:00:24.644]  Turned out that it was all made up by the intelligence agencies and when that came out in The Guardian and on a BBC awards show for a program called The Power of Nightmares which went through the history of the
[02:00:25.629 --> 02:00:26.530]  It got censored.
[02:00:26.630 --> 02:00:31.613]  The government ordered a shutdown of the story because it came out that the whole alert was fake.
[02:00:31.673 --> 02:00:36.936]  But we reported that two and a half years ago, that the Ryerson alert was totally staged.
[02:00:37.196 --> 02:00:50.503]  But that didn't stop Blair, and it's totally clear, from having somebody detonate a firecracker outside the British Embassy, inside a plant of flowers, a vase of flowers, to terrorize... See, the terrorists are striking us!
[02:00:50.603 --> 02:00:51.204]  Vote for me!
[02:00:52.937 --> 02:00:53.397]  Exactly.
[02:00:53.437 --> 02:00:56.058]  I mean, he got enough of the vote to get back in.
[02:00:56.078 --> 02:01:12.702]  He got 33% of the vote and under 60% of the country voted, which means that less than a quarter of the entire country support this government, which gives you an idea of the opposition building against all this.
[02:01:13.042 --> 02:01:15.923]  But meanwhile, they've got staged opposition with the Tories.
[02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:19.992]  Oh yeah, I mean the Tories ran on the same platform.
[02:01:20.493 --> 02:01:28.098]  Pro-National ID Card, which was introduced yesterday in the Queen's Speech, it was supposedly defeated, but they just brought it right back out again.
[02:01:28.118 --> 02:01:30.199]  I mean, they're defeating that every month!
[02:01:31.080 --> 02:01:32.541]  At least there you're able to defeat it.
[02:01:32.581 --> 02:01:36.083]  Here, we have staged elections, so they just pass it through, 100 to zip.
[02:01:36.664 --> 02:01:40.866]  But, yeah, you guys keep throwing it out, but they keep bringing it back up every month!
[02:01:40.886 --> 02:01:42.988]  I mean, how many years has this been going on?
[02:01:43.726 --> 02:01:46.248]  Well, they first talked about it about 15 years ago.
[02:01:46.268 --> 02:01:47.628]  They're still trying.
[02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:53.272]  And of course the Tories were pro-war as well, so... Don't worry, you'll have the special electronic voting machines soon.
[02:01:54.193 --> 02:01:54.433]  Good.
[02:01:56.534 --> 02:01:59.376]  And they'll say, oh, you voted for the National ID Card.
[02:01:59.756 --> 02:02:03.758]  Well, they're talking about making it a criminal offence not to vote in this country.
[02:02:03.898 --> 02:02:05.800]  So you have to support the dictatorship.
[02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:09.462]  Yeah, and then they'll just have all the idiot foreigners come vote.
[02:02:12.060 --> 02:02:13.922]  I tell you, it is unbelievable, Paul.
[02:02:14.522 --> 02:02:18.965]  I want to get briefly into the eugenics of this ABC News report and a few other tidbits, and we'll go right to calls.
[02:02:19.406 --> 02:02:21.427]  And we'll just go to calls first, then we'll get into those.
[02:02:21.908 --> 02:02:23.549]  What are some of the other things on your mind, Paul?
[02:02:24.570 --> 02:02:27.272]  As I mentioned before, the so-called Al-Qaeda No.
[02:02:27.292 --> 02:02:29.954]  3, another fake terrorist, we can go through that.
[02:02:30.555 --> 02:02:32.316]  And how are your tax dollars?
[02:02:32.516 --> 02:02:39.982]  We're going overseas to fund torture and genocide with our friends in the Uzbekistan government who like to boil people alive.
[02:02:41.647 --> 02:02:43.208]  Well, they're fighting Al Qaeda, Paul.
[02:02:44.188 --> 02:02:47.369]  We'll be right back as we cover the attack on the Republic.

[02:05:47.722 --> 02:05:52.767]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:53.148 --> 02:05:55.470]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:05:56.652 --> 02:05:59.234]  Alright, we got Paul Joseph Watson riding a shotgun with us.
[02:05:59.314 --> 02:06:02.718]  A ton of news on eugenics, the economy, the war in Iraq.
[02:06:02.738 --> 02:06:03.419]  It's all coming up.
[02:06:03.699 --> 02:06:06.782]  But let's get some of these great callers out of the way they've been holding for time immemorial.
[02:06:09.148 --> 02:06:11.369]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Denver, Colorado.
[02:06:11.409 --> 02:06:12.169]  Robert, go ahead.
[02:06:13.209 --> 02:06:14.229]  Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:06:14.249 --> 02:06:15.610]  I appreciate it.
[02:06:15.650 --> 02:06:16.610]  Great show, as always.
[02:06:16.970 --> 02:06:18.990]  I'm going to interview with Tom Tancredo.
[02:06:19.030 --> 02:06:20.351]  I'm sure you're aware of this.
[02:06:20.871 --> 02:06:31.513]  A week and two days ago, there was an off-duty Denver police officer who was shot by a guy who later came out, is in this country, looks in this country illegally, and they've been looking for him.
[02:06:31.533 --> 02:06:34.774]  Last time I heard, they were looking in California, but they suspect he might be in Mexico.
[02:06:35.532 --> 02:06:39.615]  I'm just curious what you think, if he winds up being in Mexico, how is that going to shake out?
[02:06:39.635 --> 02:06:47.462]  Well, Mexico doesn't have any extradition here, and most of the time they won't even charge people down there when there's evidence of it.
[02:06:48.243 --> 02:06:49.484]  It's ultra-massive.
[02:06:50.545 --> 02:06:57.991]  We give up all of our rights in this internationalism, but just basic stuff that every other country in the world, except for Israel and one or two others,
[02:06:58.511 --> 02:07:14.052]  I mean, even Communist China has extradition back to this country, but Mexico and Israel do not have extradition, and I was on a radio show, and right after I went off on, it's not KOA, it's KFI,
[02:07:14.941 --> 02:07:15.402]  In L.A.
[02:07:15.442 --> 02:07:31.877]  a few months ago, right after I went off, I was listening on the web, they had the District Attorney on, and he was talking about tens of thousands of crimes a year in L.A., where the people go back to Mexico, and Mexico says, we don't care, you can't have them!
[02:07:32.878 --> 02:07:39.965]  So it's very, very, very serious, and in the border states, Texas, California, Nevada, Arizona,
[02:07:40.882 --> 02:07:52.867]  New Mexico, fully, and it's higher in L.A., but fully, one-third of the violent crimes are illegal aliens, and the majority of those, of course, are from Latin America, but many others are Russian and Chinese and you name it.
[02:07:53.347 --> 02:08:00.470]  So, uh, I didn't hear about that Denver case, but we should be mad when they shoot, shoot and kill or injure anybody, not just a police officer.
[02:08:00.690 --> 02:08:04.952]  That cop is worth as much as anybody else, and no more, no less.
[02:08:05.072 --> 02:08:05.432]  Go ahead.
[02:08:06.204 --> 02:08:16.289]  Yeah, this is last night's what happened, and in the paper there's a little blurb that said Mexico, if the case involves either death penalty or life sentence with no parole, will not send them back.
[02:08:16.549 --> 02:08:18.050]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:08:18.170 --> 02:08:22.732]  If he's smart, he'll go to Mexico, and he's not necessarily untouchable, but it'll be very difficult.
[02:08:22.752 --> 02:08:26.934]  Look, everybody knows that who has got dual citizenship with Mexico or Israel.
[02:08:27.494 --> 02:08:28.435]  I mean, how many cases?
[02:08:28.935 --> 02:08:30.176]  Folks, there are thousands.
[02:08:31.016 --> 02:08:32.136]  It is ridiculous.
[02:08:32.197 --> 02:08:32.937]  Paul comments.
[02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:37.494]  Well, I mean, you're lucky that you even have a debate about it in that country.
[02:08:38.797 --> 02:08:42.020]  In this country, they don't even use the term illegal immigrants.
[02:08:42.420 --> 02:08:44.181]  They call them asylum seekers.
[02:08:45.602 --> 02:08:55.408]  Now granted, there are some people who genuinely seek asylum from foreign dictatorships, but certainly not everyone, and that's what everyone's called in this country that tries to get in.
[02:08:55.888 --> 02:09:02.413]  So if you don't support the introduction of asylum seekers, then you support these foreign dictatorships.
[02:09:02.453 --> 02:09:04.454]  That's how the debate works in this country.
[02:09:04.734 --> 02:09:05.275]  Unbelievable!
[02:09:06.275 --> 02:09:06.655]  All right.
[02:09:06.755 --> 02:09:07.556]  Thank you for the call.
[02:09:07.596 --> 02:09:08.517]  Great points, Robert.
[02:09:09.597 --> 02:09:12.539]  Up next in Ohio, Ruben.
[02:09:12.559 --> 02:09:13.159]  Go ahead, Ruben.
[02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:15.060]  Alex, I've got three things for you.
[02:09:15.080 --> 02:09:20.023]  Number one, you're making a comparison between Vader and George Weapons of Mass Destruction Bush?
[02:09:20.824 --> 02:09:25.967]  No, I'm making a comparison between the Empire with Darth Vader, and I'm not the one making it.
[02:09:25.987 --> 02:09:32.391]  I've made it, but now everybody's making it, so I'm commenting on it, and the globalists that control our government.
[02:09:33.237 --> 02:09:37.020]  I was just going to say both Vader and Bush have twins for children.
[02:09:37.881 --> 02:09:39.543]  Not that I'm naive enough to believe.
[02:09:39.583 --> 02:09:40.904]  Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it?
[02:09:41.264 --> 02:09:42.125]  Yeah.
[02:09:42.205 --> 02:09:44.187]  Second thing, I have a 9-11 story for you.
[02:09:45.187 --> 02:09:59.580]  Last year I heard David Von Kleist on Coast to Coast, and he brought up an article that I first found on your website, PrisonPlan.com, where planes landed at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport on September the 11th.
[02:10:00.822 --> 02:10:02.263]  Yeah, a lot of mysterious stuff happened.
[02:10:02.283 --> 02:10:03.624]  What was, Dave, back on Coast to Coast?
[02:10:04.105 --> 02:10:04.886]  This was a year ago.
[02:10:04.906 --> 02:10:05.466]  Oh, OK.
[02:10:05.906 --> 02:10:08.389]  OK, so the article was real fresh in my head.
[02:10:08.469 --> 02:10:13.613]  It was a Cincinnati WCPO TV station had this article on their website for three years.
[02:10:14.073 --> 02:10:18.918]  And they said Flight 93 and possibly Flight 175 landed in Cleveland, right?
[02:10:19.738 --> 02:10:22.861]  Yeah, they did shut down the airport and a bunch of weird, mysterious stuff happened.
[02:10:23.621 --> 02:10:37.548]  Well, this one TV station said that it was Flight 93 due to a bomb threat and that Mayor Mike White routed the plane safely and evacuated to see if there was an actual bomb on there.
[02:10:38.548 --> 02:10:52.295]  Well, it just so happens that at this fancy restaurant I work at up here in Northeast Ohio, Mayor Michael R. White, who was the mayor of Cleveland at the time, he was giving a speech to women or whatever, so I approached him in the parking lot
[02:10:52.731 --> 02:10:55.473]  And I asked him, I said, you know, how you doing?
[02:10:55.573 --> 02:11:04.639]  Made some small talk, and I asked him, do you remember what happened to the planes on September the 11th that were landed at Cleveland Hopkins International due to a bomb threat?
[02:11:05.479 --> 02:11:08.781]  And Mayor Michael White said, no, I don't remember.
[02:11:09.642 --> 02:11:19.468]  And that threw me for a loop because, you know, everybody remembers exactly what they were doing on that day, and he doesn't remember about these two planes that landed on the runway.
[02:11:19.848 --> 02:11:22.050]  And then I read to him the story
[02:11:23.123 --> 02:11:27.585]  And he said, oh, I know what you're talking about, but that wasn't on September the 11th.
[02:11:27.705 --> 02:11:29.866]  And I said, well, was it before or after?
[02:11:29.886 --> 02:11:34.348]  He said, I don't recall, but it was a separate event.
[02:11:34.908 --> 02:11:37.669]  So that may be insignificant or maybe something else.
[02:11:37.809 --> 02:11:38.889]  I just thought I'd share that with you.
[02:11:39.390 --> 02:11:40.510]  It's very interesting.
[02:11:41.350 --> 02:11:43.371]  And a lot of weird stuff happened that day.
[02:11:43.411 --> 02:11:48.533]  They had so many drills going with other aircraft that were quote, part of the drill.
[02:11:48.573 --> 02:11:52.815]  And that's why the airports and NORAD and the FAA were standing down.
[02:11:53.661 --> 02:11:58.705]  And so they had ghost flights, we know this, that mirrored the real flights that confuse everybody.
[02:11:58.745 --> 02:11:59.346]  Paul Watson?
[02:12:00.306 --> 02:12:07.192]  Well, yeah, and that's why you'll get different explanations of different types of aircraft in the skies over Pennsylvania on that day.
[02:12:07.312 --> 02:12:08.933]  They meant to do this to confuse.
[02:12:08.953 --> 02:12:10.614]  This is what the CIA and others do.
[02:12:11.395 --> 02:12:20.082]  Yeah, I mean, to say they could have switched planes is a reasonable argument with the evidence, but then the opposing argument would be why complicate the whole thing?
[02:12:20.618 --> 02:12:42.837]  There's definitely a danger that if you get bogged down with the minutiae of the details of the attack, that a lot of those things are kind of obvious government disinfo, whereby you forcefully claim, for example, that no plane hit the Pentagon, and then in six months' time the government releases the video of Flight 77 hitting the Pentagon.
[02:12:43.337 --> 02:13:03.430]  I mean, there's no doubt that flight 175 that hit the South Tower does not look like a 767 from any of the footage, but it's not something that we exhaustively offer as proof of government involvement, because it's very dangerous to do so, and we have evidence which is even more damning.
[02:13:04.011 --> 02:13:10.235]  But a lot of people do, and, you know, we've gave them time in the past to wear those pieces of evidence, so...
[02:13:11.152 --> 02:13:15.334]  We're still trying to remain balanced on the issue, but we have presented some of those.
[02:13:15.434 --> 02:13:21.316]  Yeah, we're sticking to Bush funding, Bin Laden, the Karloff Group, quadrupling its profits.
[02:13:21.777 --> 02:13:31.221]  We focus on CIA insider trading, the NORAD drills, the plane standing down, Dick Cheney in control, the so-called hijackers being government agents.
[02:13:31.521 --> 02:13:32.361]  We can prove that.
[02:13:32.381 --> 02:13:33.001]  Thanks for the call.
[02:13:33.862 --> 02:13:34.322]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:13:34.962 --> 02:13:42.149]  Just to let you know, I gave this, I don't know if he's on the up or not, but I gave Michael White a copy of George Hemphrey's Great Illusion.
[02:13:42.549 --> 02:13:45.612]  It was the only video I had on me at the time to give him out to everybody.
[02:13:45.992 --> 02:13:47.694]  And Paul, can I ask you when your birthday is?
[02:13:49.175 --> 02:13:52.598]  It's next week, Tuesday, May 24th.
[02:13:53.319 --> 02:13:54.460]  Alright, thank you, I appreciate that.
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:55.561]  How old are you turning? 23.
[02:13:58.058 --> 02:13:58.918]  I appreciate it.
[02:13:58.958 --> 02:14:00.539]  We've got a lot of calls here, folks.
[02:14:00.839 --> 02:14:01.940]  Don't ask me my birthday.
[02:14:02.100 --> 02:14:03.240]  I don't give that kind of stuff out.
[02:14:04.301 --> 02:14:08.863]  I'll tell you how old I am, but I'm not going to tell you where I live or what my favorite foods are.
[02:14:08.923 --> 02:14:10.083]  It's not about Alex Jones.
[02:14:11.164 --> 02:14:13.605]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:14:13.685 --> 02:14:17.066]  Let's talk to Mike in New York City!
[02:14:17.427 --> 02:14:18.047]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:14:18.687 --> 02:14:19.207]  Hi, Alex.
[02:14:19.267 --> 02:14:19.768]  How are you?
[02:14:19.948 --> 02:14:21.708]  Good.
[02:14:21.748 --> 02:14:26.330]  You ask, why will people not confront this madness that's all around us?
[02:14:28.231 --> 02:14:47.157]  And I gotta tell you, you know, I think part of it, and not all of it, but part of it is the inability for people to have a free, open conversation about, for instance, the role of Israel in the world and America's ties to Israel.
[02:14:47.417 --> 02:14:53.259]  The moment you begin even to bring it up, you're immediately labeled an anti-Semite.
[02:14:53.919 --> 02:14:57.300]  And after they label you an anti-Semite, the conversation is over,
[02:14:58.103 --> 02:15:03.225]  You're kicked out of the conversation, you're ostracized from the room, whatever cocktail party you're in.
[02:15:03.766 --> 02:15:10.048]  You're not even allowed to discuss or be remotely critical of anything.
[02:15:11.049 --> 02:15:11.909]  You've made that point.
[02:15:12.049 --> 02:15:15.051]  I think it's a taboo is what you're saying.
[02:15:15.251 --> 02:15:24.015]  Yeah, and this is an integral part to understanding it and having an open discussion to get people to understand it, to get them to listen to it.
[02:15:25.610 --> 02:15:27.751]  And that right there is a dead end.
[02:15:27.951 --> 02:15:40.294]  Once you go down that road, which leads me to the point, surely you must have been criticized for it, you've probably been called an anti-Semite, I would imagine, I don't know if you have or not, for even bringing it up.
[02:15:41.395 --> 02:15:47.196]  Well let me let you go because we're about to break here and it's an interesting point and I want to try to comment on this.
[02:15:47.216 --> 02:15:52.558]  I have been attacked by the ADL and by others
[02:15:53.956 --> 02:15:57.997]  For not agreeing with every policy of Israel.
[02:15:59.818 --> 02:16:02.239]  But they haven't really called me an anti-Semite because I'll sue them if they do.
[02:16:02.399 --> 02:16:02.779]  I've told them.
[02:16:03.719 --> 02:16:14.123]  But at the same time, I get criticized by everybody and their dog for not saying Israel runs everything and they're the center of evil and that's where Darth Sidious lives and
[02:16:14.969 --> 02:16:15.909]  You know, all of this.
[02:16:16.549 --> 02:16:21.570]  I see Israel as run by an organized crime syndicate, just like our government, just like the British government.
[02:16:21.630 --> 02:16:26.951]  But because the British government's run by an organized crime syndicate, I don't believe that the British people are bad.
[02:16:27.771 --> 02:16:28.131]  Okay?
[02:16:28.872 --> 02:16:35.833]  Half of the Israelis in Israel know their government's corrupt, don't like them censoring news, don't like the endless war.
[02:16:35.873 --> 02:16:40.094]  They found out that they're funding the Al-Qaeda groups and funding fake terror groups.
[02:16:40.114 --> 02:16:41.614]  I mean, that's mainstream Israeli news.
[02:16:42.677 --> 02:16:54.751]  And so, what the globalists do is they point at the extreme camp that goes, all Jews are evil, seeds of the devil, and if you talk bad about Israel, see, you agree with these guys in white hoods, which is ridiculous!
[02:16:55.544 --> 02:17:07.793]  And so, that side is bad, and so is the side that says, you're going to hell if you don't worship Israel, when all the prophets came to say, Israel, you're run by corrupt people, you're not doing what God told you to do.
[02:17:07.813 --> 02:17:18.420]  I mean, Moses threw his tablets down on the people that run the world today, regardless of what group they are, that evil group that follows the Babylon mystery religions.
[02:17:19.000 --> 02:17:22.341]  And are there a group of Jews that are devil-worshipping New World Order people?
[02:17:22.641 --> 02:17:22.901]  Yes.
[02:17:22.921 --> 02:17:24.081]  Do they work with Nazis?
[02:17:24.121 --> 02:17:24.441]  Yes.
[02:17:24.842 --> 02:17:26.202]  Is truth stranger than fiction?
[02:17:26.262 --> 02:17:26.622]  Yes.
[02:17:27.422 --> 02:17:33.084]  But to perseverate on Jews all day, it actually helps the New World Order.
[02:17:34.044 --> 02:17:39.845]  Because they want to mix a debate into anything we talk about, adding Israel into it for what you just said.
[02:17:40.725 --> 02:17:43.686]  But if you go at it from the angle I do, you can wake people up.
[02:17:44.186 --> 02:17:46.887]  I'm against the organized crime figures that run Israel.
[02:17:49.008 --> 02:17:55.912]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow unsightly toenails.
[02:17:56.432 --> 02:18:01.855]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:18:02.256 --> 02:18:12.301]  All Natural Non-X is a topical ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:18:12.402 --> 02:18:14.823]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:18:15.123 --> 02:18:18.204]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:18:18.305 --> 02:18:19.825]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:18:19.945 --> 02:18:27.429]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:18:27.689 --> 02:18:29.409]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:18:29.770 --> 02:18:41.435]  You'll find Nonex Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:18:42.016 --> 02:18:43.238]  Non-X Nail Gel!
[02:18:43.458 --> 02:18:46.364]  For clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals!
[02:18:47.913 --> 02:18:51.394]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:18:51.654 --> 02:18:55.135]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[02:19:14.299 --> 02:19:19.643]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[02:19:19.803 --> 02:19:23.566]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:23.926 --> 02:19:25.808]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.

[02:19:53.851 --> 02:19:54.732]  It still is!
[02:19:55.352 --> 02:19:58.836]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[02:19:59.176 --> 02:20:00.978]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[02:20:01.518 --> 02:20:03.580]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[02:20:04.136 --> 02:20:06.157]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[02:20:06.538 --> 02:20:14.203]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[02:20:14.583 --> 02:20:18.365]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[02:21:28.346 --> 02:21:30.148]  Don't take unnecessary risks!

[02:21:37.936 --> 02:21:38.437]  Call now!
[02:21:52.967 --> 02:22:10.079]  Alright, Tom in New York and others are coming up, then I'm going to plunge into the news with Paul, but Paul, I mean, the people that love to bash Jews all day, it's like they're, you know, little kids that have stolen the Playboy magazine out from, you know, under their parents' bed or something.
[02:22:10.119 --> 02:22:10.519]  They just
[02:22:11.032 --> 02:22:16.136]  They constantly rattle on about it as if it's doing anything to the New World Order.
[02:22:16.616 --> 02:22:18.138]  And they even criticize me at nauseam.
[02:22:18.338 --> 02:22:20.139]  Why is Alex Jones talking about Nazis?
[02:22:20.399 --> 02:22:22.501]  Why is Alex Jones talking about Arnold Schwarzenegger?
[02:22:22.741 --> 02:22:28.486]  Because every time I've done real study, not lazy bones behavior, it's led me back to death cults.
[02:22:29.605 --> 02:22:33.427]  And it doesn't matter if somebody's a Jew or a German, they're in this death cult.
[02:22:33.507 --> 02:22:34.708]  That's who really runs things.
[02:22:35.028 --> 02:22:49.315]  We just posted new photos that they got out from inside Skull and Bones on a little-known Discovery Channel program, or History Channel program, excuse me, that hardly even ran, showing the horrible, satanic stuff in there.
[02:22:49.835 --> 02:22:52.456]  And I've really studied this, folks, and this is what's running it.
[02:22:52.516 --> 02:22:55.057]  This is the most powerful group.
[02:22:55.558 --> 02:22:57.619]  It's high-level masons, even above P2.
[02:22:58.679 --> 02:23:00.480]  And again, I'm not bashing all nations.
[02:23:00.921 --> 02:23:02.482]  I'm saying it's the highest-level ones.
[02:23:02.542 --> 02:23:04.403]  Most of the others are useful idiots.
[02:23:04.824 --> 02:23:09.687]  See, if you just bash Masons, most Masons who aren't high-level think you're a liar, because they're not high-level.
[02:23:10.027 --> 02:23:13.130]  If you bash Jews, Jews go, well, I'm not bad, you're a liar!
[02:23:13.470 --> 02:23:16.152]  Or if you bash Catholics, they're going to go, hey, why are you bashing me?
[02:23:16.612 --> 02:23:20.755]  It's evil people in control of all these major groups.
[02:23:20.815 --> 02:23:21.876]  Paul Watson comments.
[02:23:22.964 --> 02:23:23.384]  Well, yeah.
[02:23:23.544 --> 02:23:26.325]  I mean, I've been doing this for four or five years.
[02:23:26.366 --> 02:23:29.027]  You've been doing it for, what, 12, 13, 14 years.
[02:23:29.067 --> 02:23:37.770]  I've never seen one piece of evidence which suggests that one race, whether it be Jews or Muslims or Christians, control the world.
[02:23:38.951 --> 02:23:44.093]  Are there racist, myopic groups out there which say that without any evidence?
[02:23:44.413 --> 02:23:46.054]  Yes, and it's because they're racist.
[02:23:46.787 --> 02:24:05.659]  What we'll do is we'll post the article and the photographs where 100,000 Orthodox Jews are in New York City protesting against the Israeli government turfing Palestinians off their land, which they also do to Orthodox Jews in Israel.
[02:24:06.139 --> 02:24:12.223]  And you can have 100,000... The CPS in Israel is taking a lot, I mean a lot, of the Orthodox Jews' children.
[02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:18.974]  Yeah, I mean, they know that the Israeli government is not representative of Jews.
[02:24:19.595 --> 02:24:29.062]  Just like the American government is not representative... I mean, is there a particular organized crime gang that happens to be a group that call themselves Jews that are really an ancient European tribe?
[02:24:29.342 --> 02:24:31.364]  Do they love prancing around saying they're Jews?
[02:24:31.384 --> 02:24:33.366]  Do they love us bashing them as Jews?
[02:24:33.906 --> 02:24:35.227]  Absolutely, they love it!
[02:24:36.108 --> 02:24:38.910]  Yeah, they love it, and I mean, that's why, you know, Ariel Sharon
[02:24:39.762 --> 02:24:41.803]  Say things like, we control America.
[02:24:42.363 --> 02:24:44.303]  Because he loves that kind of power trip.
[02:24:44.543 --> 02:24:47.164]  But he's just, you know, mid-level, like all the rest of them.
[02:24:47.724 --> 02:24:51.245]  And this larger global crime syndicate controls them all.
[02:24:51.445 --> 02:24:55.626]  And when that larger global crime syndicate really gets together, they devil worship.
[02:24:57.927 --> 02:24:59.167]  That's what they are, folks.
[02:24:59.387 --> 02:25:02.248]  They're devil worshipers.
[02:25:02.568 --> 02:25:06.429]  They're not Jews, they're not Easter bunnies, they're devil worshipers.
[02:25:07.522 --> 02:25:09.343]  And that's from research, folks.
[02:25:10.364 --> 02:25:12.445]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tom.
[02:25:12.465 --> 02:25:13.926]  Tom, where are you calling from?
[02:25:14.807 --> 02:25:15.587]  New York City.
[02:25:15.907 --> 02:25:16.227]  Welcome.
[02:25:16.948 --> 02:25:17.428]  How are you doing?
[02:25:17.448 --> 02:25:18.509]  Nice first time calling.
[02:25:18.869 --> 02:25:19.590]  Welcome, go ahead.
[02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:24.072]  Just started getting some of your information over the last couple of weeks and I really appreciate it.
[02:25:24.813 --> 02:25:27.314]  Just wondering what you think is the real story in the U.S.
[02:25:27.394 --> 02:25:31.016]  behind, like, drug wars and the marijuana wars and all that kind of shit.
[02:25:31.317 --> 02:25:32.677]  Yeah, I appreciate your call, sir.
[02:25:32.717 --> 02:25:33.238]  Take care.
[02:25:33.678 --> 02:25:36.780]  What goes on is, and it's really simple,
[02:25:38.400 --> 02:25:42.523]  Is that they sell you on a counterculture and tell you drugs are cool with the media they own.
[02:25:43.744 --> 02:25:49.489]  And then you use the drugs because you think they're cool, and then they put you in one of their private prisons that the drug cartels own.
[02:25:50.390 --> 02:25:55.654]  And then when you hear about a drug cartel getting busted, it's a drug cartel that's small and wasn't paying its cut.
[02:25:56.403 --> 02:26:03.469]  And they've caught the CIA more than a hundred times shipping giant plane loads and train loads and ship loads of cocaine and heroin in.
[02:26:03.889 --> 02:26:12.537]  And the very same companies that own those operations own the private big pharma cartels pushing drugs that are even worse than illegal drugs on our children.
[02:26:12.717 --> 02:26:16.700]  So the drug culture is a bunch of idiots for thinking they're rebellious and cool.
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:20.223]  You're a bunch of moron punks using Uncle Sam's dope!
[02:26:20.903 --> 02:26:21.364]  Stop it!
[02:26:22.569 --> 02:26:26.291]  And the people with the drug war putting everybody in prison are a bunch of scum!
[02:26:26.311 --> 02:26:27.232]  Paul Watson!
[02:26:28.473 --> 02:26:33.676]  Well, yeah, it's amazing how they sell it as rebellion when it's the ultimate form of conformity.
[02:26:34.677 --> 02:26:35.257]  Slavery!
[02:26:36.038 --> 02:26:39.460]  You know, what's the first thing they did after they went into Afghanistan?
[02:26:39.520 --> 02:26:41.581]  Kicked out the drug control agency.
[02:26:42.262 --> 02:26:50.687]  Regained control of that Golden Crescent and the opium, the heroin, started flooding onto major British and American streets within months.
[02:26:53.010 --> 02:27:03.361]  Absolutely, and you know, it isn't because they don't want you to open your mind with the drugs, and it isn't because the drugs are so cool, and they just don't want you to... They want you to use drugs.
[02:27:03.381 --> 02:27:04.863]  They advertise them as rebellious.
[02:27:05.404 --> 02:27:09.208]  Europe put up signs saying don't smoke cigarettes and smoking doubled in 10 years.
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:12.041]  People do what they think is rebellious and cool.
[02:27:12.301 --> 02:27:14.441]  Well, the real rebellion's right here!
[02:27:14.941 --> 02:27:16.302]  And it's about life and death!
[02:27:16.842 --> 02:27:19.642]  To all the young people out there on drugs, get off of them!
[02:27:19.923 --> 02:27:30.945]  Go for a bike ride, go play baseball, spend time with your family, go out and look at the night sky with a telescope, go hiking, go mountain biking, stop using their drugs!
[02:27:31.846 --> 02:27:32.166]  Okay?
[02:27:32.206 --> 02:27:33.486]  You're a bunch of idiots!
[02:27:38.536 --> 02:27:41.540]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[02:28:48.388 --> 02:28:54.631]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:54.771 --> 02:29:00.934]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:29:01.214 --> 02:29:09.578]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:09.898 --> 02:29:16.945]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.

[02:30:00.688 --> 02:30:07.733]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:08.114 --> 02:30:14.219]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:14.239 --> 02:30:15.580]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:15.900 --> 02:30:18.864]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.

[02:30:47.014 --> 02:30:56.982]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:57.582 --> 02:31:00.525]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:02.782 --> 02:31:07.187]  Yeah, man, we're gonna defeat the New World Order with Howard Gene, dude.
[02:31:07.907 --> 02:31:12.312]  And by smoking pot, we really fight the tyranny that defeats them.
[02:31:12.372 --> 02:31:12.992]  No, it doesn't.
[02:31:13.833 --> 02:31:14.494]  Get it straight.
[02:31:14.734 --> 02:31:15.855]  I'm against the drug war.
[02:31:15.895 --> 02:31:17.577]  I'm from total legalization.
[02:31:19.098 --> 02:31:19.419]  Okay?
[02:31:20.146 --> 02:31:21.107]  Because it's a fraud.
[02:31:21.147 --> 02:31:26.690]  Back when you could buy all this stuff on the street corner at the local drug store, very few Americans were on it.
[02:31:27.150 --> 02:31:33.934]  By making it illegal, you put money into it to the black market, you build criminal gangs, you empower the corrupt police, it goes on and on.
[02:31:34.435 --> 02:31:36.756]  Paul Watson, any more comments on the phony drug war?
[02:31:37.817 --> 02:31:38.237]  Well, no.
[02:31:38.377 --> 02:31:42.219]  I mean, just to say, I don't take drugs, but I've been around people who do.
[02:31:42.779 --> 02:31:48.603]  And not once in my entire life have I ever had a mind-expanding conversation with somebody on drugs.
[02:31:51.068 --> 02:31:51.789]  I agree with you.
[02:31:51.869 --> 02:32:00.576]  I mean, it's just... You know, people get mad because I'm against the drug war and they love that, but then I don't fawn at their feet about their disgusting drug culture.
[02:32:01.377 --> 02:32:02.238]  It's now public!
[02:32:02.618 --> 02:32:05.180]  The documents were released after he died in his own diary.
[02:32:05.601 --> 02:32:10.765]  Timothy Leary was a CIA, FBI minion out to push the drug culture.
[02:32:11.186 --> 02:32:16.770]  Gloria Steinem was giving CIA money as an officer to start Miss Magazine to break our families up.
[02:32:17.231 --> 02:32:18.512]  I mean, I'm sorry, it's a bunch...
[02:32:19.435 --> 02:32:21.677]  And look, I've smoked cigarettes and cigars.
[02:32:21.717 --> 02:32:22.417]  They're horrible.
[02:32:23.278 --> 02:32:25.360]  I've drunk beer, you know, quite a bit.
[02:32:25.420 --> 02:32:26.360]  It's not good for me.
[02:32:26.380 --> 02:32:29.743]  I mean, low levels are, but, you know, the problem is you tend to drink a lot of it.
[02:32:29.763 --> 02:32:35.788]  I mean, none of this stuff's good, folks, but it doesn't mean I'm for controlling it, because when you control it, it actually causes more of it.
[02:32:35.808 --> 02:32:40.811]  Because it puts money into it and then creates a market and a mechanism to deliver it to market, Paul.
[02:32:41.992 --> 02:32:46.816]  Well, yeah, and then you look at the so-called cultural leaders like Timothy Leary.
[02:32:47.481 --> 02:32:49.782]  You know, what ended up happening to him?
[02:32:50.483 --> 02:32:52.684]  Did his mind evolve to such a great level?
[02:32:52.744 --> 02:32:56.206]  No, he turned into an alcoholic deadbeat and then he died.
[02:32:56.226 --> 02:32:58.927]  I mean, nothing good happens on drugs.
[02:33:00.908 --> 02:33:04.570]  The fact is, we've got all the drugs we need right here in our brains that God gave us.
[02:33:05.311 --> 02:33:10.994]  When you do good works, when you are happy, when you're working hard, when you're doing the right thing, you feel super good.
[02:33:11.014 --> 02:33:13.935]  In fact, you feel too good.
[02:33:13.955 --> 02:33:15.596]  I've got too much energy sometimes.
[02:33:17.761 --> 02:33:19.462]  I'm a kind of a holic, a workaholic.
[02:33:20.043 --> 02:33:23.325]  I've tried to get Lord Watson to be a workaholic, which he's doing a better job of.
[02:33:24.045 --> 02:33:27.247]  You're the benchmark, Alex.
[02:33:27.467 --> 02:33:28.648]  I don't know about that.
[02:33:29.128 --> 02:33:36.793]  Hey, but speaking of lordliness, we've got Bush on record saying he wants to be a dictator.
[02:33:36.833 --> 02:33:37.674]  Let's play that clip.
[02:33:38.814 --> 02:33:39.475]  But that's okay.
[02:33:40.612 --> 02:33:42.993]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[02:33:44.514 --> 02:33:45.835]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:33:48.717 --> 02:33:49.978]  Let's hear that one more time.
[02:33:50.858 --> 02:33:51.519]  But that's okay.
[02:33:51.539 --> 02:33:55.061]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.
[02:33:56.561 --> 02:34:00.284]  Just so long as I'm the dictator.
[02:34:00.624 --> 02:34:03.786]  Folks, that's a real clip, okay?
[02:34:04.166 --> 02:34:04.446]  Paul?
[02:34:05.567 --> 02:34:09.069]  Well, I don't think you'd hear George Washington say anything like that.
[02:34:09.764 --> 02:34:10.684]  Let's just put it that way.
[02:34:11.324 --> 02:34:13.285]  But we have, Bill Clinton said some more things.
[02:34:13.325 --> 02:34:17.226]  We're seeing a dictatorship being set up of the elite in this country.
[02:34:17.266 --> 02:34:27.689]  It's totally against all of our morals, our freedoms, our common sense, our way of life, our economy, and people are waking up to it, but they're not moving fast enough to resist it.
[02:34:27.729 --> 02:34:37.592]  Paul, I want to just get into PrisonPlanet.tv here for a second, then I want to get into some of the news, but tell folks what they'll see and get at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:38.876 --> 02:35:00.666]  They'll get all your documentary films, including obviously the latest, Martial Law, all three hours, plus DVD extras, Alex's weekly television report, Film Live, and a year's worth of that in the archives, which, you know, equates to dozens and dozens of previous TV reports, all an hour long or more.
[02:35:00.706 --> 02:35:05.888]  And that TV show has won Best TV Show in Austin, and normally it's the UT football game or
[02:35:07.083 --> 02:35:10.426]  Or, uh, Austin City Limits that wins, and the readers fold back.
[02:35:10.466 --> 02:35:11.347]  It's a good TV show.
[02:35:12.368 --> 02:35:17.352]  Well, yeah, I mean, because you've got, you know, the tool of television at your disposal that you haven't got on the radio.
[02:35:17.412 --> 02:35:22.477]  So, you know, for example, you could play Orwell's 1984, the film version.
[02:35:22.517 --> 02:35:25.800]  I'll analyze that, how it's mirroring reality today.
[02:35:26.341 --> 02:35:31.145]  So it's just an extension of, you know, what we're trying to get across here.
[02:35:31.992 --> 02:35:42.634]  And my book, your book, we're going to start work on a new project which will be on there first for members of course, as all the documentary films are, before they're released.
[02:35:43.474 --> 02:35:58.597]  And 15 cents a day if you subscribe for a year, credit card or PayPal, takes a minute, it's very easy, and we encourage everyone to do it to support the free material which we could put out to everybody who can't afford subscriptions.
[02:35:59.597 --> 02:36:04.522]  And that pays for the webmasters so you guys can live in some modicum of comfort.
[02:36:05.562 --> 02:36:08.265]  And it's so important, folks.
[02:36:08.285 --> 02:36:11.648]  So PrisonPlanet.tv or CallTollFree, my new film.
[02:36:11.668 --> 02:36:13.950]  In fact, let me just put you on hold for a second, Paul.
[02:36:13.970 --> 02:36:15.692]  I'm going to plug this film and we'll get into the news.
[02:36:16.232 --> 02:36:18.855]  Martial law 9-1-1 rise of the police state.
[02:36:19.855 --> 02:36:24.259]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:36:24.279 --> 02:36:25.781]  The Constitution has been shredded.
[02:36:26.852 --> 02:36:28.573]  And America is now a police state.
[02:36:28.993 --> 02:36:34.237]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of his orchestrators.
[02:36:34.777 --> 02:36:43.042]  Learn the terrifying secret that holds the future of the world in its grasp from the front lines of the police state, the darkest sanctum of the secret society that controls it.
[02:36:43.083 --> 02:36:45.184]  Martial law reveals the master plan of the global
[02:36:45.604 --> 02:36:48.905]  Elite hell-bent on capturing America today and tomorrow, the world.
[02:36:49.225 --> 02:36:51.446]  The New World Order has set in motion the Fourth Reich.
[02:36:51.506 --> 02:36:57.088]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:36:57.388 --> 02:37:06.631]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideologies, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into their own prison planet.
[02:37:06.972 --> 02:37:09.893]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:37:10.213 --> 02:37:13.154]  Three hours long on DVD, two and a half plus hours on VHS.
[02:37:14.454 --> 02:37:18.720]  You get one copy for $25.95, a second copy for $19.95, and third copies.
[02:37:19.100 --> 02:37:20.822]  It just keeps going down in price.
[02:37:21.303 --> 02:37:23.726]  I've got other great films I've produced, upwards of 75% off.
[02:37:25.899 --> 02:37:27.500]  You need these films.
[02:37:27.780 --> 02:37:28.840]  They're having a big effect.
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:29.161]  Get them.
[02:37:29.581 --> 02:37:30.161]  Make copies.

[02:37:52.134 --> 02:37:55.696]  And, uh, Paul, uh, we've got nothing but good reviews about the film.
[02:37:55.716 --> 02:37:58.077]  I know we haven't posted any new reviews in a while, but we're still getting them.
[02:37:58.097 --> 02:37:58.797]  We should post them.
[02:37:58.817 --> 02:38:00.678]  What are the reviews we've been getting for Martial Law?
[02:38:02.159 --> 02:38:04.260]  Um, that it's your best film to date.
[02:38:04.940 --> 02:38:08.442]  Um, people like the fact that you're out there on the street.
[02:38:08.502 --> 02:38:10.223]  You're not sat in a TV studio.
[02:38:10.263 --> 02:38:16.746]  You're seeing what's happening, and people can see it happening right behind you, um, during the Republican National Convention.
[02:38:17.620 --> 02:38:29.448]  So, if you want to read reviews, they're on the subscription page at PrisonPlanet.tv and obviously the Martial Law page, which is the banner there at the top of the website.
[02:38:29.488 --> 02:38:31.230]  Well, really, I don't promote this film enough.
[02:38:31.270 --> 02:38:34.192]  It's my best work and we're going to be showing it at the Alamo Draft House.
[02:38:34.552 --> 02:38:37.254]  Three separate showings, two on one night, one on another.
[02:38:37.734 --> 02:38:39.996]  Friday, June 3rd, downtown Austin.
[02:38:40.337 --> 02:38:42.199]  Alamo Draft House, downtown.
[02:38:42.659 --> 02:38:44.661]  Friday, June 3rd, 7 and 10 p.m.
[02:38:44.701 --> 02:38:50.206]  I'll give a speech beforehand, play the film, and have 15-20 minutes of question and answer after each showing.
[02:38:50.667 --> 02:38:56.853]  And then, June 8th, Wednesday, June 8th, at 8 p.m., we'll have a longer speech, a longer question and answer.
[02:38:57.669 --> 02:39:03.034]  At the Alamo Drafthouse, and that's the Alamo Drafthouse on South Lamar.
[02:39:03.334 --> 02:39:07.338]  You can buy tickets online, very easy to do, at Infowars.com.
[02:39:07.358 --> 02:39:10.741]  Just link through to the Alamo Drafthouse website to the sub-page.
[02:39:10.761 --> 02:39:13.143]  You can purchase it off their secure server right there.
[02:39:13.183 --> 02:39:14.324]  I want to see everybody out there.
[02:39:14.665 --> 02:39:18.168]  Can't wait to see all the books and videos and all the materials there.
[02:39:19.189 --> 02:39:23.713]  Paul, I've got this ABC News article that you posted yesterday.
[02:39:25.320 --> 02:39:30.865]  And the headline is, State Secret Thousands Secretly Sterilize Secrets.
[02:39:31.686 --> 02:39:38.131]  And it says, in North Carolina alone, they sterilize tens of thousands.
[02:39:38.492 --> 02:39:40.213]  This went on until the mid-1980s.
[02:39:40.293 --> 02:39:44.557]  I had guests on about this years ago, and it's been out there, but now it's becoming more widely known.
[02:39:46.681 --> 02:40:00.456]  A lot of women were sterilized without even their own knowledge and without the public's knowledge beneath the surface of this southern town with its lush evergreens and winding riverbanks and a largely forgotten legacy of pain, secrecy, and human indignity.
[02:40:01.336 --> 02:40:06.702]  My heart still bleeds and it will bleed forever because of what happened to me, local resident Elaine Riddick said.
[02:40:06.722 --> 02:40:09.105]  Riddick was one of thousands of people she really sterilized with the state.
[02:40:09.645 --> 02:40:10.286]  From 1929 to 1974.
[02:40:10.346 --> 02:40:13.088]  Not true, it went on to 85 in Oregon.
[02:40:13.628 --> 02:40:29.121]  From the 1900s to 1970, some 65,000 women and men, now again folks, it was over 400,000 total, this is one program, were sterilized in this country, many without their knowledge as part of a government eugenics program to keep so-called undesirables from reproducing.
[02:40:30.037 --> 02:40:31.119]  And they would come grab them.
[02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:32.742]  It's a social worker.
[02:40:33.262 --> 02:40:34.665]  They had labeled her promiscuous.
[02:40:34.685 --> 02:40:37.349]  They came and grabbed her, knocked her out, and cut her uterus out.
[02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:38.731]  The point is, it's $400,000.
[02:40:38.912 --> 02:40:40.674]  In this particular program, they say $65,000.
[02:40:40.775 --> 02:40:42.798]  I have the other articles where they say $400,000, $350,000.
[02:40:45.467 --> 02:40:48.350]  And, uh, they did this to people that made under a B+.
[02:40:49.011 --> 02:40:50.612]  That's even been in PBS documentaries.
[02:40:50.992 --> 02:40:56.197]  How could this go on for 70, 80 years without anybody in the general public knowing it?
[02:40:56.277 --> 02:40:58.339]  It was a federal government secret.
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:00.962]  Paul, I mean, you can't keep things like this secret!
[02:41:00.982 --> 02:41:02.663]  You can't keep 9-11 secret!
[02:41:02.984 --> 02:41:03.764]  Boulderdash!
[02:41:04.685 --> 02:41:05.346]  Poppycock!
[02:41:05.366 --> 02:41:06.027]  Your comments.
[02:41:07.148 --> 02:41:10.491]  Well, again, it goes back to the thing you hear time and time again.
[02:41:11.286 --> 02:41:15.549]  When you get in debates with people, they'd never do something like this.
[02:41:16.290 --> 02:41:25.576]  When all throughout history, we see that people who get in positions of power, you know, bad people, but bad people who think they're doing good.
[02:41:25.897 --> 02:41:36.484]  It's this social Darwinism thick justification that these people had poor intelligence, thereby that was a reason to stop them from
[02:41:39.915 --> 02:41:48.898]  Well, a few months ago the legislature, they argued, the chairman and people there at the meeting, the doctors for the state, that these people genetically are weak.
[02:41:49.478 --> 02:41:52.679]  That's why we're putting over two-thirds of the foster children on drugs.
[02:41:53.499 --> 02:41:55.380]  And it's just this particular case with Riddick.
[02:41:56.553 --> 02:42:04.738]  She went in to have a baby at age 13 and they labeled her promiscuous and feeble-minded and sterilized her.
[02:42:04.799 --> 02:42:12.283]  But there were other cases even more egregious than this, Paul, where they'd have medical students cut uteruses out and cut testicles off.
[02:42:13.144 --> 02:42:15.005]  I mean, this is some vicious stuff, folks.
[02:42:16.198 --> 02:42:18.899]  Well, yeah, and you know the people making the policy.
[02:42:18.919 --> 02:42:20.579]  I mean, that's pure evil.
[02:42:21.019 --> 02:42:29.781]  But then the people who carry it out have sold this, um, goes back to the whole Straussian noble lie thing of the greater cause.
[02:42:30.001 --> 02:42:31.581]  But how did they keep it secret?
[02:42:31.621 --> 02:42:33.501]  It was secret until the mid-eighties.
[02:42:33.821 --> 02:42:34.821]  It's now admitted.
[02:42:34.841 --> 02:42:38.162]  Four hundred... But the point is, folks, they keep secret whatever they want.
[02:42:38.182 --> 02:42:42.923]  Because I hear this thing about 9-11, they would...
[02:42:43.997 --> 02:42:48.241]  It comes out, it just never comes out on the nightly news, so the average American doesn't know.
[02:42:48.261 --> 02:42:51.023]  Well, exactly.
[02:42:51.603 --> 02:42:55.006]  I mean, maybe there's a reason for releasing it now, I don't know.
[02:42:55.026 --> 02:43:03.113]  It's probably just to sweep it under the carpet and prevent some kind of widespread investigation by kind of just acknowledging it, at least.
[02:43:03.573 --> 02:43:05.875]  Well, we know this is still going on, that's my point.
[02:43:05.895 --> 02:43:09.578]  They're doing testing on prisoners in prisons, they're putting stuff in vaccines.
[02:43:10.379 --> 02:43:13.120]  I mean, they're doing, I mean, they've had, it's now public for about five years.
[02:43:13.600 --> 02:43:21.564]  If you're 32 years old, now 33, and you were born in a hospital, your blood was put in an illegal federal DNA database.
[02:43:22.384 --> 02:43:27.066]  If you lived in England, Australia, Canada, the US, or New Zealand, this has happened to you.
[02:43:29.447 --> 02:43:38.491]  I'm in the Netherlands there, euthanizing newborn babies with simple birth defects that can be fixed very easily.
[02:43:38.591 --> 02:43:39.231]  Cleft lip,
[02:43:40.919 --> 02:43:41.619]  Cleft palate.
[02:43:43.560 --> 02:43:44.260]  Simple stuff.
[02:43:44.460 --> 02:43:46.741]  Oh, they wouldn't have a good life with that little scar on their lip.
[02:43:46.781 --> 02:43:49.242]  Oh, I got a couple friends that had cleft lips.
[02:43:49.562 --> 02:43:53.463]  It's better for the government just to walk them out in the street and blow their heads off, Paul.
[02:43:54.263 --> 02:43:57.764]  Well, yeah, and there was another case in Britain whereby a baby's ill.
[02:43:58.444 --> 02:44:01.685]  The parents are holding out hope for its recovery.
[02:44:01.725 --> 02:44:04.346]  They're flying the best surgeons in the world over.
[02:44:05.026 --> 02:44:09.948]  But it's down to the mandate of one judge who decrees that this baby should die.
[02:44:10.922 --> 02:44:11.882]  Same in every case.
[02:44:14.303 --> 02:44:15.044]  But it doesn't matter.
[02:44:15.104 --> 02:44:21.486]  We have our feel-good issues where Bush passes laws to kill people begging for food, but then he fights for one lady, so he must be good.
[02:44:22.907 --> 02:44:23.427]  Well, yeah.
[02:44:23.527 --> 02:44:30.750]  I mean, when he, on death row, he joked about the woman who begged him for death, and he's supposedly pro-life.
[02:44:32.871 --> 02:44:36.892]  But, I mean, we're talking about passing a law in Texas where your insurance runs out that they'd let you die.
[02:44:38.773 --> 02:44:40.614]  Yeah, you've got similar laws in this country.
[02:44:42.825 --> 02:44:48.506]  I remember Tony Blair debating social wise medicine and he said, it's not true, it's not true what the other party says.
[02:44:49.226 --> 02:44:50.406]  No, no it's not.
[02:44:50.787 --> 02:44:54.887]  We only have an 11 month waiting period, not 16 months for cancer surgery.
[02:44:55.587 --> 02:45:00.048]  I mean there's stories every week about people who need to have legs, arms amputated.
[02:45:00.068 --> 02:45:05.209]  They've been on a year, two year waiting list and they amputate the wrong leg.
[02:45:05.649 --> 02:45:08.850]  Oh yeah, and that's when, because you've got all the nice foreign doctors they brought in.
[02:45:09.888 --> 02:45:14.111]  Yeah, just like our VA who got their medical license out of a Cracker Jack box.
[02:45:14.651 --> 02:45:18.253]  Well, they call them special skills working visas now.
[02:45:18.694 --> 02:45:20.875]  Really skillful to amputate the wrong leg.
[02:45:21.375 --> 02:45:22.616]  Let me tell you, it's a nightmare.
[02:45:22.656 --> 02:45:28.860]  I mean, these foreign doctors, I mean, some of them are great, but most of them, just because their schools aren't as good, folks.
[02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:31.281]  I mean, literally, they're, ugh.
[02:45:33.983 --> 02:45:36.745]  I think you've got to be Indian, though, to have a job with the VA.
[02:45:37.938 --> 02:45:39.819]  Whatever happened to affirmative action there?
[02:45:40.479 --> 02:45:42.360]  You don't see any black or white doctors there.
[02:45:44.401 --> 02:45:47.783]  Everybody I've talked to has got to go to the VA and go, let me guess, your doctor's Indian.
[02:45:47.823 --> 02:45:48.483]  How'd you know?
[02:45:48.543 --> 02:45:49.564]  Well, that's all there is.
[02:45:50.464 --> 02:45:52.645]  And again, their medical schools aren't as good as ours.
[02:45:54.406 --> 02:45:55.387]  Oh, it's pointless, Paul.
[02:45:57.028 --> 02:45:57.488]  I'm evil.
[02:45:57.548 --> 02:45:58.488]  I'm xenophobic now.
[02:45:58.528 --> 02:46:02.610]  It's like saying the best cheese, the best chocolate comes from Switzerland.
[02:46:02.970 --> 02:46:04.251]  I don't like American chocolate.
[02:46:04.271 --> 02:46:05.792]  That means I'm against American chocolate, Paul.
[02:46:07.742 --> 02:46:14.343]  I know, and I mean, it's even worse amongst my peer group with that kind of... I mean, it's thought control.
[02:46:14.463 --> 02:46:22.625]  You're thought of as racist, xenophobe, if you just use certain words, which have become taboo, as we spoke about earlier.
[02:46:22.665 --> 02:46:23.385]  Homosexual.
[02:46:24.245 --> 02:46:31.566]  Using that in a conversation with someone my age in this country, I would be deemed as being a thought criminal.
[02:46:32.827 --> 02:46:34.347]  But heterosexual is okay.
[02:46:34.867 --> 02:46:35.027]  Yeah.
[02:46:35.962 --> 02:46:41.106]  And people are saying, look in Scotland Yard, arrest you if you say the word homosexual.
[02:46:41.887 --> 02:46:46.571]  They don't believe that Paul, can you repost the Robin Page interview along with the BBC article under it?
[02:46:47.752 --> 02:46:52.076]  Yeah, I can trace back the MP3 audio interview as well.
[02:46:52.096 --> 02:47:02.785]  Yeah, that's in the old, old, old Prison Planet, like three year old archives, and then we got the BBC, where they reported, oh yes, he was very evil and he apologized and he, uh, we had him on the show, he's very evil, he said the word homosexual.
[02:47:03.165 --> 02:47:04.226]  He wasn't even criticizing them.
[02:47:06.385 --> 02:47:08.026]  Again, folks, that's mind control!
[02:47:09.547 --> 02:47:21.255]  Paul, what about these latest Skull & Bones photos we got off of stills, the Cremation2Care website did, these stills off of a Discovery Channel piece where it shows the inside.
[02:47:21.295 --> 02:47:22.896]  Now, I've heard about these photos, but here they are.
[02:47:23.236 --> 02:47:27.339]  This is so scary, these satanic demons and the blood in the fountain.
[02:47:27.459 --> 02:47:28.779]  Boy, this sounds very Christian.
[02:47:30.380 --> 02:47:32.622]  I haven't seen them, so I don't know any detail, but
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:44.606]  Obviously we're going to grab those, put up a page later on today and grab the DVD and put it on prisonplanet.tv so people can look forward to that.
[02:47:44.666 --> 02:47:48.588]  Well what I'll do is place a short clip and comment on it, yeah.
[02:47:48.768 --> 02:47:52.830]  Yeah, our good buddies over at thecremationofcare.com have got that.
[02:47:53.190 --> 02:47:54.171]  It's really scary.
[02:47:54.271 --> 02:47:55.031]  It's on Prison Planet.
[02:47:55.051 --> 02:47:55.851]  You haven't seen it yet, Paul?
[02:47:56.872 --> 02:47:57.772]  No, I posted it.
[02:47:57.832 --> 02:47:59.653]  I didn't have a chance to look at it in depth.
[02:48:01.656 --> 02:48:04.039]  I'll tell you, there's just so much other stuff I wanted to cover.
[02:48:04.359 --> 02:48:06.241]  Here in the final segment, what else do you want to talk about?
[02:48:07.923 --> 02:48:11.146]  We need to talk about the Al-Qaeda number three supposedly arrested.
[02:48:11.166 --> 02:48:13.388]  Yeah, let's talk about fake terror alerts.
[02:48:13.408 --> 02:48:14.910]  That's always a good way to close out.
[02:48:15.630 --> 02:48:17.112]  Well, yeah, we documented on the show.
[02:48:18.167 --> 02:48:32.296]  Um, you know, from Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to Ramzi Bin Al-Sheikh, the fact that in every case they're either dead, they've already been arrested, or they pop up a week later in a different country, and with the so-called Al-Qaeda, number three, a very similar case.
[02:48:33.376 --> 02:48:37.859]  Or there's a fourth thing they do, they go, oh, we arrested him for his security, he's really a CIA officer.
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:46.444]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, to expose Al-CIAda, right here, on InfoWars.
[02:48:48.340 --> 02:48:52.666]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:52.846 --> 02:48:57.292]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:57.432 --> 02:49:01.858]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:49:01.878 --> 02:49:03.219]  The New World Order.
[02:49:04.980 --> 02:49:09.202]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:09.262 --> 02:49:16.204]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:16.324 --> 02:49:18.385]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:18.685 --> 02:49:29.129]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:29.329 --> 02:49:32.090]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new
[02:49:32.170 --> 02:49:33.412]  This is a two and a half hour video.
[02:49:33.452 --> 02:49:34.734]  Police Day 3 is for you.
[02:49:35.194 --> 02:49:38.720]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:38.740 --> 02:49:39.120]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:39.140 --> 02:49:40.262]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:49:47.672 --> 02:49:55.179]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:55.460 --> 02:50:06.390]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:07.871 --> 02:50:12.034]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:12.374 --> 02:50:22.821]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:23.121 --> 02:50:23.621]  That's right!
[02:50:23.801 --> 02:50:30.924]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:31.204 --> 02:50:35.346]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:51:55.432 --> 02:51:58.254]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:00.536 --> 02:52:01.577]  Final segment.
[02:52:03.138 --> 02:52:05.860]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:52:07.701 --> 02:52:16.308]  Paul, I mean, there have been a bunch of cases where they arrest the guy and it comes out a month later, oh, he was really a CIA asset but they had to stage the arrest to keep him safe.
[02:52:16.668 --> 02:52:18.930]  That's only after people in the government get mad and leak it.
[02:52:19.577 --> 02:52:25.201]  Those are just the cases we know about, because most of these Al-Qaeda really are CIA, been on the payroll since the 80's.
[02:52:25.861 --> 02:52:33.746]  But in these other cases, I mean, they kill them three or four times, they capture them four or five times, and they never retract the last killing with the next killing.
[02:52:34.126 --> 02:52:36.087]  Why do they recycle the same names?
[02:52:36.127 --> 02:52:39.289]  Is this like testing to see if they can just lie and get away with it?
[02:52:40.290 --> 02:52:43.532]  Yeah, I think it is, because this latest one is beyond the pale.
[02:52:44.515 --> 02:52:49.317]  Um, he was presented to us as Al Qaeda number three, closely associated with Bin Laden.
[02:52:49.777 --> 02:52:54.179]  You know, someone with recent contact with Bin Laden, someone who could lead us to Bin Laden.
[02:52:55.040 --> 02:52:57.521]  Um, Fox News reveled in it for days.
[02:52:57.941 --> 02:53:00.982]  They said it was another sign that Bush was winning the war on terror.
[02:53:01.002 --> 02:53:02.783]  Um, I watched the
[02:53:03.487 --> 02:53:17.659]  Neocon John Gibson Show on Fox and they had government officials and current CIA agents on snickering about how they wished they were in the interrogation room with the Pakistanis so they could torture him.
[02:53:18.339 --> 02:53:19.400]  It was all very loving.
[02:53:19.980 --> 02:53:24.444]  But then we're not for torture and we don't order even though the memo says so.
[02:53:25.545 --> 02:53:30.329]  But then there's no retraction when it comes out the government has to admit he's not the guy they said he was.
[02:53:31.323 --> 02:53:38.329]  No, it turns out the London Times described him as among the floats and jets of the organisation.
[02:53:39.330 --> 02:53:47.237]  Al Libby is his name, spelled L-I-B-B-I, as he was the guy presented to us.
[02:53:47.998 --> 02:53:54.183]  But he wasn't the real Mr Al Libby, which is spelled L-I-B-Y instead of I on the end.
[02:53:54.653 --> 02:54:04.424]  So on the basis of a misspelt name, this guy becomes Al-Qaeda number three, becomes a justification that the war on terror is real in the first place.
[02:54:05.405 --> 02:54:14.554]  Meanwhile, Fox won't talk about how Buzzy Krongard told the Times of London face to face, we don't want to capture Bin Laden and it's come out in the big newspapers that they're protecting Bin Laden.
[02:54:15.716 --> 02:54:16.637]  Well exactly, but...
[02:54:17.853 --> 02:54:23.414]  You know, on the basis of a spelling mistake, they use this as gas mileage to renew the Patriot Act.
[02:54:23.954 --> 02:54:29.456]  So if some terrorist has the name Joheim, they can just change it to Jones and arrest all Joneses.
[02:54:30.376 --> 02:54:35.157]  Exactly, and Americans are none the wiser because it's only in the European newspapers.
[02:54:35.577 --> 02:54:38.498]  So we're going to be hearing about this Newsweek retraction for weeks.
[02:54:39.173 --> 02:54:42.235]  Where's the retraction that they captured Al-Qaeda number three?
[02:54:42.255 --> 02:54:44.477]  Now Paul, what did you get from this Newsweek?
[02:54:44.737 --> 02:54:46.238]  It's not even clear when I read the articles.
[02:54:46.258 --> 02:54:49.981]  What are they supposedly retracting here?
[02:54:50.381 --> 02:54:52.803]  Because these reports are all admitted to be true.
[02:54:53.243 --> 02:54:57.686]  We have interrogators and others going public, but then Newsweek, what are they retracting?
[02:55:00.148 --> 02:55:05.992]  From what I get, they're retracting that they put a Quran in the toilet.
[02:55:08.621 --> 02:55:11.222]  But that's been coming out for years from everybody getting released.
[02:55:11.242 --> 02:55:14.302]  I mean, they admit they quote, do things that make them uncomfortable.
[02:55:15.462 --> 02:55:24.804]  And the latest on it is that Michael Isaacoff of Newsweek offered his resignation.
[02:55:27.545 --> 02:55:29.525]  So that's the latest on it on the Drudge Report.
[02:55:30.926 --> 02:55:33.186]  So yeah, it's again about the minutiae.
[02:55:33.646 --> 02:55:38.227]  When we've had dozens of former internees that have come out and said that they did things
[02:55:38.877 --> 02:55:42.040]  Not only torture, but things to disgrace the religion.
[02:55:42.601 --> 02:55:45.884]  Ten times worse than putting a Quran in the toilet.
[02:55:46.284 --> 02:55:55.132]  Yeah, the media didn't want to focus on our own military officers quitting and saying that we were basically, you know, they were defecating on it and urinating on it.
[02:55:56.073 --> 02:55:57.154]  It's so sick, Paul.
[02:55:57.855 --> 02:55:59.516]  They really got this stuff figured out, though.
[02:55:59.537 --> 02:56:00.958]  They are so good at manipulating.
[02:56:01.738 --> 02:56:10.641]  Well, I mean, if some Christians got caught in Iraq and these guys were, you know, doing these kind of things for the Bible, you can guarantee that would be all over the news.
[02:56:12.081 --> 02:56:12.782]  It's amazing.
[02:56:13.102 --> 02:56:13.742]  It's amazing.
[02:56:13.942 --> 02:56:15.743]  If it was false, there'd be no retraction.
[02:56:17.343 --> 02:56:20.884]  All right, well, I appreciate you joining us, Paul, and Godspeed.
[02:56:20.904 --> 02:56:28.887]  Look for my big Star Wars article, mirroring, I'm putting a lot of work into it, The Globalist, compared to the fiction of this movie.
[02:56:29.603 --> 02:56:32.353]  It'll be a great way to wake the young people up, so be sure and spread it around.
[02:56:32.875 --> 02:56:35.243]  God bless you all, now get out there and take on the New World Order.
