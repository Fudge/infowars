[00:00:05.846 --> 00:00:06.486]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:08.227]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.927 --> 00:00:10.027]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.688 --> 00:00:11.488]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:13.229]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.470]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.072]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.697 --> 00:00:33.518]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:33.558 --> 00:00:34.519]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:34.539 --> 00:00:36.040]  It is November 3rd, 2005, and I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.643]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours, and we have three guests joining us.
[00:00:38.663 --> 00:00:38.923]  Coming up...
[00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:10.556]  At the start of the next hour, David Swanson, co-founder of the After Downing Street organization, on Bush's real approval ratings after the Downing Street movement began to expose his activities.
[00:01:10.616 --> 00:01:13.878]  And then coming up at the half hour in the middle of the next hour...
[00:01:14.478 --> 00:01:31.504]  We're going to have Craig Monona on, Organic Consumers Association staff scientist, on how Congress has rammed through a sneak attack on organic standards despite massive consumer opposition and how the organic food standard has been ruined.
[00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:34.195]  Very important public service announcement.
[00:01:35.097 --> 00:01:41.688]  All the details of how you can't believe that USDA or that FDA certification that it's organic.
[00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:44.894]  You really never could, but now it's a guaranteed fraud.
[00:01:45.692 --> 00:02:07.841]  And then coming up in the third hour, we're going to have Thomas H. Naylor on, founder of the Second Vermont Republic, which is pushing a resolution that the state of Vermont peacefully and democratically free itself from the United States of America and return to its natural status as an independent republic as it was between January 15, 777, that is 1777, and March 4, 1791.
[00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.063]  In the week before 9-11, they were set to vote.
[00:02:22.044 --> 00:02:30.588]  The week after 9-11, but the week before 9-11, I had on mayors, city councilmen, select women, select men from New Hampshire.
[00:02:31.477 --> 00:02:33.219]  And they had the majority of votes.
[00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:35.221]  They had the majority of the counties ready to go.
[00:02:35.321 --> 00:02:38.084]  They were going to withdraw from the Union.
[00:02:38.444 --> 00:02:40.687]  The right to revolt clause caused him.
[00:02:41.007 --> 00:02:47.994]  All that got dropped with rallying around the plastic Chinese flags, the American desecrated flags, after 9-11.
[00:02:48.014 --> 00:02:53.440]  So the soul of America went one step closer to the bowels of Hades.
[00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:14.376]  And, of course, I had a state representative on from Arizona right before 9-11 who introduced legislation and passed out a committee but stalled, never got to a full vote because their legislative session ended in 2000, that if, quote, martial law was declared or gun confiscation began, which both those things have now started,
[00:03:16.581 --> 00:03:17.282]  We're good to go.
[00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:32.579]  District of Columbia, private corporation, running the United States, totally controlling us.
[00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:40.681]  They are literal parasites that control the nervous system of this country, and thus the population, and use us for global empire.
[00:03:41.002 --> 00:03:48.104]  We have to have states remove themselves from the Union, and then reconstitute under the original Bill of Rights or Constitution.
[00:03:48.124 --> 00:03:51.765]  And by the way, that is just not our right, if this sounds radical to you.
[00:03:52.846 --> 00:03:56.487]  It is not just our right, it is our sacred sworn duty.
[00:03:57.139 --> 00:03:59.180]  And, of course, that comes from the terrorist manual.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.080]  I'm not kidding.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.120]  FEMA teaches terrorists.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.821]  So do FBI training manuals.
[00:04:03.061 --> 00:04:03.961]  You have it all on videotape.
[00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:07.942]  That comes from the evil Declaration of Independence.
[00:04:08.562 --> 00:04:13.663]  And, of course, the Federalist Papers, the Anti-Federalist Papers, they were all in agreement on that key subject.
[00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:19.345]  And so there is a real move to do this, and I think it's a wonderful idea.
[00:04:20.863 --> 00:04:24.626]  I would move to have Texas remove itself from the Union.
[00:04:24.726 --> 00:04:36.355]  The problem is that you've got a bunch of ne'er-do-wells, on average, running around declaring themselves high admirals and high generals and presidents battling over who the Supreme Leader is of the Republic of Texas.
[00:04:36.755 --> 00:04:38.756]  You don't do it that way, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:38.816 --> 00:04:43.440]  You have a vote of the people, and you pull out of it, and then you have elections.
[00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:46.984]  And then you elect on a statewide basis the president.
[00:04:47.004 --> 00:04:49.266]  You don't declare yourself president first.
[00:04:49.667 --> 00:04:56.915]  George Washington didn't do that in 1775 when he was commissioned as the general by the Congress meeting there in Philadelphia.
[00:04:57.115 --> 00:04:57.856]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.896 --> 00:04:58.357]  Stay with us.
[00:04:58.537 --> 00:05:00.219]  Massive transmission of information.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.080]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:06.341]  The behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.461 --> 00:05:10.362]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.422 --> 00:05:14.663]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:18.764]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.905 --> 00:05:20.725]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.925 --> 00:05:24.206]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.246 --> 00:05:28.968]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:32.169]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:35.210]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:41.813]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.353 --> 00:05:42.853]  We're good to go.
[00:06:01.198 --> 00:06:01.799]  Hello, folks.
[00:06:01.899 --> 00:06:02.839]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:07.063]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.203 --> 00:06:10.065]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.145 --> 00:06:16.870]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.053]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.273 --> 00:06:22.655]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.775 --> 00:06:31.101]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine,
[00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:31.361]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:31.441 --> 00:06:32.882]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.783 --> 00:07:02.203]  We're good to go.
[00:07:02.243 --> 00:07:02.463]  I think?
[00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:29.836]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:29.976 --> 00:07:33.379]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:34.541]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:34.841 --> 00:07:36.122]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:36.322 --> 00:07:43.149]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:45.711]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[00:07:48.832 --> 00:07:48.872]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.892 --> 00:07:49.853]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:08:02.168 --> 00:08:04.329]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:07.750]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:22.675]  Eight minutes, 17 seconds into this first hour of worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:23.235 --> 00:08:28.837]  I'm excited about this interview with the folks that are trying to get Vermont to secede from the Union.
[00:08:28.877 --> 00:08:30.338]  Vermont really is the model.
[00:08:31.434 --> 00:08:35.438]  They have a concealed carry that is just, hey, we got the Second Amendment.
[00:08:35.478 --> 00:08:36.279]  This is America.
[00:08:36.779 --> 00:08:39.882]  If you don't have a felony record, you can carry a gun concealed.
[00:08:39.942 --> 00:08:42.584]  And, of course, they have the lowest crime rate in the Union because of it.
[00:08:43.245 --> 00:08:45.046]  Their taxes are incredibly low.
[00:08:45.146 --> 00:08:57.858]  The people, whether they consider themselves to be liberal or conservative or greedy when it comes to defending their private property rights and the rights of the family and the rights of the state against the federal government,
[00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:01.353]  And we've seen New Hampshire try to pull out right before 9-11.
[00:09:01.393 --> 00:09:02.134]  They had the vote.
[00:09:02.494 --> 00:09:03.374]  It was going to happen.
[00:09:04.355 --> 00:09:06.276]  I'm not saying the globalists carried out 9-11 for that.
[00:09:06.296 --> 00:09:10.679]  They did it for oil, weapon sales, opium, domestic police state activities.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.920]  I'm a war president.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.621]  No one can question me when I'm a war president.
[00:09:13.861 --> 00:09:15.843]  You know, Bush told his bogger for that in 99.
[00:09:16.623 --> 00:09:21.487]  It was for those reasons, but they may have done a threat analysis and seen that they had the votes in New Hampshire.
[00:09:21.507 --> 00:09:26.330]  They were going to pull out under Article 10, right to revolt, peaceably and remove themselves.
[00:09:27.557 --> 00:09:32.181]  In the state constitution there may have been some computerized war game analysis that that was going to happen.
[00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:37.704]  By the way, I can't stand the Republic of Texas here in the state of Texas.
[00:09:38.285 --> 00:09:38.865]  Why is that?
[00:09:40.006 --> 00:09:42.288]  And I know, I'm digressing right here at the beginning of the program.
[00:09:42.308 --> 00:09:52.755]  I did that first little five-minute segment and mentioned that we've got folks coming on about the Downing Street memo and the movement to expose that as a smoking gun and where Bush's approval ratings really are.
[00:09:52.775 --> 00:09:53.976]  That's coming up at the start of the next hour.
[00:09:54.316 --> 00:10:03.603]  Again, in the middle of the next hour, Craig Minona about how they're taking all the organic food standards off of the federal government will just certify anything.
[00:10:03.963 --> 00:10:09.087]  It can be 75% genetically engineered or have inorganic...
[00:10:10.459 --> 00:10:18.751]  Ingredients in it will still certify it, so we'll tell you what seals to look for that will still guarantee that your food is safe and why organic food is so important.
[00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:26.722]  And then also, as I mentioned during the third hour, Thomas H. Naylor, founder of the Second Vermont Republic, which is pushing a resolution.
[00:10:27.262 --> 00:10:41.249]  That the state of Vermont peacefully and democratically free itself from the United States of America and return to its natural status as an independent republic as it was between January 15 and 1777 and March 14, 1791.
[00:10:43.070 --> 00:10:54.155]  Now, why do I get into this article and just mention that we've got a guest coming up in the third hour and then I begin savaging the Republic of Texas individuals here in this state?
[00:10:54.878 --> 00:11:01.024]  And by that, I don't mean every member of the Republic of Texas, the 400 different groups there are, basically.
[00:11:01.184 --> 00:11:08.890]  By that, I don't mean everyone who has latched onto this idea and believes that it is noble and pure and good and an excellent idea.
[00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:18.799]  I'm talking about the leadership that I've met, that I've investigated, that I have gone and interviewed on the air, in the studio, with my cameras, at their events.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:22.062]  It is nothing but delusional power-tripping.
[00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:30.256]  And there's kind of a sad custom around the world of nobody's just declaring that they're generals.
[00:11:31.697 --> 00:11:35.719]  Nobody's just affixing themselves in these fancy uniforms.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:39.182]  And I really, frankly, think it's a COINTELPRO operation.
[00:11:39.482 --> 00:11:50.329]  I know some of these people are just rubes and idiots and, as I said earlier, ne'er-do-wells who basically like to present each other with medals and start around feeling powerful.
[00:11:52.342 --> 00:11:56.505]  But I've looked at the Zenith right when the Republic of Texas kicked off.
[00:11:57.586 --> 00:12:14.939]  It was a crowd of people that loved to play secret agent, that loved to run around in the desert in their Jeeps, again, general outfits, thinking everyone was coming after them, everyone was getting them, phone calls with coded messages, running around.
[00:12:16.078 --> 00:12:16.618]  We're good to go.
[00:12:35.018 --> 00:12:46.402]  That has got the real momentum and the real population to lead other states into leaving the union, because it's a fraud now, and reforming the union.
[00:12:46.882 --> 00:12:48.682]  And that's why I was so disgusted.
[00:12:48.923 --> 00:12:56.365]  I mean, imagine, folks, that you'll have somebody who's got maybe five members of his Republic of Texas, and he declares himself president.
[00:12:57.025 --> 00:13:01.026]  And literally, they come, say, to the TV studio to do an interview.
[00:13:01.106 --> 00:13:02.227]  This is back in the late 90s.
[00:13:03.918 --> 00:13:14.368]  Say 1997, 1998, and their envoy walks in and goes, the president's about to be here, and starts looking around, hmm, security, hmm, do you realize you treat the president with special respect?
[00:13:15.038 --> 00:13:24.600]  And then some ne'er-do-well comes walking through the door with lots of jewelry and big nugget rings and this ridiculous cowboy hat.
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.900]  And you start asking them cowboy head questions.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.640]  They don't know which end of the horse is what.
[00:13:29.281 --> 00:13:30.361]  It's just a joke.
[00:13:30.761 --> 00:13:32.281]  This isn't dress-up.
[00:13:32.341 --> 00:13:33.881]  This isn't playland.
[00:13:34.141 --> 00:13:36.902]  This isn't some type of game, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:37.382 --> 00:13:39.082]  This is serious business.
[00:13:39.102 --> 00:13:40.843]  Do you understand that?
[00:13:40.903 --> 00:13:42.543]  This is not a game.
[00:13:44.622 --> 00:13:49.863]  And in New Hampshire and several other states and in Arizona and in Vermont, they're serious about it.
[00:13:49.883 --> 00:13:51.324]  They're going to the legislatures.
[00:13:51.624 --> 00:13:53.964]  They're having the counties pull out.
[00:13:54.465 --> 00:13:56.025]  They're really doing it.
[00:13:56.645 --> 00:13:57.005]  Okay?
[00:13:57.045 --> 00:14:02.467]  And you don't have to hide under the table and walk around in military insignia to do that.
[00:14:03.187 --> 00:14:04.127]  That's not how we did it in 1776.
[00:14:04.167 --> 00:14:05.127]  We had a Congress...
[00:14:08.266 --> 00:14:19.749]  Of the elected representatives from the state legislatures, from the colonies at that time, the Colonial Federation, before it then became, about a year later, an actual Declaration of Independence.
[00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:31.673]  This stuff all started in 1775, and then they went and amongst themselves voted on who they thought would be the best general to lead the forces.
[00:14:32.353 --> 00:14:35.794]  Okay, and that's because it was a military operation from the beginning.
[00:14:36.094 --> 00:14:38.475]  We don't need a military operation from the beginning here.
[00:14:38.675 --> 00:14:41.076]  That automatically gives the globalists what they want.
[00:14:41.336 --> 00:14:43.996]  It automatically militarizes it from day one.
[00:14:44.316 --> 00:14:49.578]  In our Bill of Rights, in our Constitution, and in our state constitutions, we all have the right.
[00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:57.813]  Except for three or four western states, but by president they have it as well, because they were territories and never truly ceded state status.
[00:14:58.473 --> 00:15:03.236]  Some of those states out there really don't have that power, though I believe through president they do.
[00:15:03.256 --> 00:15:14.843]  But clearly states like Texas and New York and New Hampshire and Vermont, these very important states, they have a total right and a duty to succeed.
[00:15:15.263 --> 00:15:16.684]  It's in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:15:16.744 --> 00:15:18.825]  And then reform the union.
[00:15:20.054 --> 00:15:33.864]  But out of the gates, we have clowns dressing up in military outfits in the one state where we got 23 million people, where we have a real heritage of being an independent country, where we could really get this job done.
[00:15:34.525 --> 00:15:44.712]  Out of the gates, people acted like a bunch of insane clowns, militarizing it from the first millisecond that it was born.
[00:15:45.541 --> 00:15:51.007]  And so it's seen as buffoonery and clownery and quackery from the word dot.
[00:15:52.068 --> 00:15:53.309]  And that's not the way to do it.
[00:15:53.349 --> 00:15:58.715]  I mean, if you really want to remove ourselves from the union, we do what we've done with the Patriot Act resolutions.
[00:15:58.755 --> 00:16:01.318]  And I'm not tooting my own horn, folks, but I got on air...
[00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:12.413]  Right after the Patriot Act passed, and I said, the key is to have states and cities and counties pass laws that they're going to follow the Constitution of the state and the federal government, and that this is null and void.
[00:16:12.873 --> 00:16:18.935]  And I put that idea out, and I wrote proposals, and others picked it up and improved upon it, and in some cases watered it down, and now over 400...
[00:16:21.277 --> 00:16:30.170]  These are real ideas here, folks, because I use a historical lens to be able to come up with these ideas.
[00:16:30.811 --> 00:16:31.732]  It's not rocketry.
[00:16:32.012 --> 00:16:33.034]  It's not rocket science.
[00:16:34.415 --> 00:16:46.579]  And so I don't want to get an email or a letter threatening me because I don't worship the Republic of Texas because I don't want to dress up in a militia outfit and automatically get on their turf and automatically militarize this.
[00:16:46.839 --> 00:16:47.900]  We're mainstream.
[00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:49.320]  We wear suits and ties.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:52.041]  We go in with legislation.
[00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:55.644]  We take over societies, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:55.864 --> 00:17:01.949]  We don't just automatically run out and start declaring ourselves admirals and generals and supreme rulers.
[00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:11.736]  And then you ended up with, no exaggeration, there had to be 15 different presidents at one time, all battling with each other, declaring themselves supreme rulers.
[00:17:12.957 --> 00:17:13.838]  No one elected you.
[00:17:14.979 --> 00:17:16.660]  This is bizarre fruitcake-dom.
[00:17:17.262 --> 00:17:19.063]  I mean, I'm pretty popular in Austin, Texas.
[00:17:19.103 --> 00:17:22.985]  I could get thousands of people out for a mock election to declare me mayor of Austin.
[00:17:23.165 --> 00:17:24.706]  That wouldn't make me mayor of Austin.
[00:17:24.926 --> 00:17:30.388]  I have no desire to have some petty trinket or signet of office.
[00:17:30.408 --> 00:17:31.088]  Who cares?
[00:17:32.609 --> 00:17:34.730]  So now I've been ranting for the first ten minutes here.
[00:17:34.790 --> 00:17:38.612]  It's just that this frustrates me so badly.
[00:17:39.753 --> 00:17:46.454]  I mean, if you really want to have Texas as an independent country, which I would just absolutely love, and I don't want to hear who the Muslims will kill us if we do that.
[00:17:46.494 --> 00:17:48.515]  Oh, we've got to have our big military to do this.
[00:17:48.915 --> 00:17:51.335]  It's all pure baloney, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:52.056 --> 00:17:53.276]  Nobody's attacking Switzerland.
[00:17:53.316 --> 00:17:54.296]  Nobody's attacking Russia.
[00:17:54.316 --> 00:17:56.236]  Nobody's attacking African countries.
[00:17:56.256 --> 00:17:57.517]  Nobody's attacking Venezuela.
[00:17:57.857 --> 00:18:04.178]  It's because a private group of individuals have seized control of our government and are using our government as a military tool for global domination.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.504]  And then we're not even really a target even though that's happening.
[00:18:07.544 --> 00:18:14.173]  The globalists target us to keep us in line with their operations to be their good little slaves.
[00:18:15.134 --> 00:18:18.239]  And I am for the reformation of the unions.
[00:18:19.139 --> 00:18:26.361]  But we're not going to march on the District of Columbia and have some glorious battle as all these provocateurs, and that's a pure sign.
[00:18:26.721 --> 00:18:31.842]  These people that openly get on the air and call for open insurrection and attacking the President, attacking D.C.
[00:18:32.362 --> 00:18:36.643]  If you say that, and you get away with that, you are a big fat fit.
[00:18:36.984 --> 00:18:38.384]  We've seen countless examples of that.
[00:18:38.404 --> 00:18:46.506]  They're provocaturing, trying to radicalize us, so they can then go get certification against our organizations from the Department of Defense.
[00:18:47.406 --> 00:18:50.227]  To then rule us covertly as enemy combatants.
[00:18:50.487 --> 00:18:53.848]  By the way, that's been going on a long time before George Bush used the term.
[00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:57.029]  We've got documents where Clinton was calling militias enemy combatants in 1995.
[00:18:58.690 --> 00:19:01.551]  So I hope you realize this, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:19:01.631 --> 00:19:03.451]  We are the legitimate America.
[00:19:03.852 --> 00:19:08.753]  We are the people fighting the seditious, larcenous, traitorous pieces of trash.
[00:19:09.333 --> 00:19:11.134]  I want to remove from the Union...
[00:19:12.208 --> 00:19:22.314]  To then call a new Congress of the states with the legislatures and first have to take over the legislatures with the vote, with the jury, with the grand jury, with every tool we've got.
[00:19:23.014 --> 00:19:25.956]  We the people need to seize control, levers of power again.
[00:19:25.976 --> 00:19:29.618]  And this takes an educational process that is ongoing as we speak.
[00:19:29.658 --> 00:19:30.659]  You're part of that right now.
[00:19:31.259 --> 00:19:33.500]  And then we must reconstitute the union.
[00:19:34.421 --> 00:19:34.861]  Okay?
[00:19:35.502 --> 00:19:37.523]  It must be done intellectually, up front.
[00:19:37.583 --> 00:19:38.383]  We have the facts.
[00:19:38.463 --> 00:19:39.224]  We have the truth.
[00:19:39.564 --> 00:19:41.245]  We can do it.
[00:19:43.485 --> 00:19:49.213]  And it's very exciting to see this organic, spontaneous movement all over the U.S.
[00:19:49.553 --> 00:19:52.698]  for states to pull out of the union because of the tyranny.
[00:19:52.818 --> 00:19:54.380]  It is very, very exciting.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.267]  New bird flu information, new nuke threat information, tons of key news.
[00:19:59.527 --> 00:20:00.929]  When we get back, stay with us.
[00:20:02.043 --> 00:20:02.483]  We're good to go.
[00:20:22.432 --> 00:20:23.974]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:20:24.134 --> 00:20:27.600]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:31.665]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:20:31.926 --> 00:20:36.893]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:38.876]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:20:39.116 --> 00:20:43.097]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:20:43.357 --> 00:20:45.238]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[00:21:13.108 --> 00:21:20.691]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:20.951 --> 00:21:24.073]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:21:24.353 --> 00:21:30.036]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.

[00:21:36.878 --> 00:21:40.780]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.

[00:22:00.388 --> 00:22:08.373]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:08.813 --> 00:22:16.558]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:16.918 --> 00:22:24.782]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:22:25.083 --> 00:22:29.845]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:30.185 --> 00:22:34.808]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:35.388 --> 00:22:39.111]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of International Banking Cartel.
[00:23:01.829 --> 00:23:02.269]  We're good to go.
[00:23:23.183 --> 00:23:23.924]  We're good to go.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:39.441]  Or call 1-866-884-9104.
[00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:39.761]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:24:10.751 --> 00:24:11.572]  All right, my friends.
[00:24:11.612 --> 00:24:15.234]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[00:24:15.294 --> 00:24:21.897]  We do have three great guests joining us later.
[00:24:23.538 --> 00:24:26.360]  You may occasionally hear a basset hound howling.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:28.721]  He likes to defend us here at the office.
[00:24:28.801 --> 00:24:30.102]  One of my staff has a
[00:24:31.025 --> 00:24:35.107]  Friendly little two-year-old basset hound, which I like dearly, named Baron.
[00:24:35.827 --> 00:24:43.410]  And Baron, during the last segment, was right outside the sound studio here, which is soundproof to some extent, but I think it even blocked out the basset hound.
[00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:44.610]  But I kind of wish it didn't.
[00:24:44.650 --> 00:24:49.092]  I wish we could have the sounds of howling basset hounds on the air.
[00:24:49.152 --> 00:24:50.272]  It's a cute little creature.
[00:24:50.292 --> 00:24:53.773]  All right, why am I now again talking about basset hounds?
[00:24:53.813 --> 00:24:58.595]  Ladies and gentlemen, you are not tuning in to hear about basset hounds, are you?
[00:24:59.915 --> 00:25:02.156]  Little cute little stub feet, though.
[00:25:02.176 --> 00:25:02.937]  He jumps up on me.
[00:25:02.957 --> 00:25:04.177]  He likes me the best, by the way.
[00:25:04.197 --> 00:25:07.099]  I was telling Ryan that his dog likes me more than he likes him.
[00:25:07.119 --> 00:25:08.039]  Dogs always like me.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:09.640]  And I like dogs.
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:10.641]  They're little creatures.
[00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:11.661]  Nice little creatures.
[00:25:11.681 --> 00:25:12.122]  All right.
[00:25:12.642 --> 00:25:14.643]  Now I've really gone off the deep end, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:25:15.764 --> 00:25:21.327]  But former MI6 head, don't rule out nuclear terrorism in Britain.
[00:25:21.727 --> 00:25:22.567]  London Telegraph.
[00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:29.391]  And at the very same time that it's coming out that Australia wants to arrest you, if you even criticize the government,
[00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:33.204]  And put you in jail for seven years if you protest the war?
[00:25:33.745 --> 00:25:37.428]  Folks, you can go read mainstream Australian newspapers.
[00:25:37.448 --> 00:25:38.949]  That's what the law actually says.
[00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:40.371]  Imagine Australia.
[00:25:40.411 --> 00:25:41.432]  They were free in the past.
[00:25:41.992 --> 00:25:43.474]  Just don't criticize the government.
[00:25:43.634 --> 00:25:46.476]  I guess they've taken the Michael Weiner Savage approach.
[00:25:46.496 --> 00:25:48.418]  If you criticize the government, it's treason.
[00:25:48.458 --> 00:25:49.119]  You go to prison.
[00:25:49.779 --> 00:25:51.361]  I thought that's what America was all about.
[00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:52.522]  But hey, c'est la vie.
[00:25:53.463 --> 00:25:54.464]  Same thing with Australia.
[00:25:54.484 --> 00:25:55.264]  I thought they had freedom.
[00:25:55.305 --> 00:25:55.685]  Not anymore.
[00:25:56.371 --> 00:25:59.713]  Well, they're all in trouble there and about to have these laws defeated.
[00:26:00.114 --> 00:26:01.875]  And Howard, their leader, is in trouble.
[00:26:02.195 --> 00:26:08.099]  So magically, Al-Qaeda pops up and says, we're going to attack you with biological weapons or chemical weapons or radiological weapons.
[00:26:08.119 --> 00:26:08.999]  We're going to bomb you.
[00:26:09.079 --> 00:26:09.660]  Just get ready.
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:17.325]  Of course, it turns out the Australian government was clearly involved with the FBI and the Bali bombing, bombing some of their own citizens on the eve of the war to bolster support.
[00:26:17.365 --> 00:26:18.285]  It's always the same MO.
[00:26:18.666 --> 00:26:19.606]  Well, the same thing here.
[00:26:19.646 --> 00:26:25.050]  Whenever Bloomberg gets in trouble for random searches violating the Fourth Amendment all over the streets and in the trains...
[00:26:26.235 --> 00:26:31.544]  Magically, Al-Qaeda pops up and there's fake threats of bombs that are about to happen.
[00:26:31.564 --> 00:26:33.327]  It turns out that was all staged.
[00:26:33.367 --> 00:26:34.449]  That's even in the New York paper.
[00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:35.130]  So what?
[00:26:35.651 --> 00:26:38.216]  And now there can be a nuke attack.
[00:26:39.562 --> 00:26:40.022]  That's right.
[00:26:40.062 --> 00:26:57.452]  The suicide bombings of July 7th were not the worst attacks that we could expect in Britain, according to the former head of MI6, Sir Richard Dearlove, who retired last year as the head of the Secret Intelligence Service, said chemical, biological, and genetic terrorism was in the prospect, and a nuclear attack could not be ruled out.
[00:26:58.253 --> 00:27:01.514]  And he said, acknowledging that the July bombings were very lethal, well, I'd say so.
[00:27:01.554 --> 00:27:03.115]  Your agency clearly carried them out.
[00:27:03.135 --> 00:27:04.776]  That's the preponderance of evidence.
[00:27:04.976 --> 00:27:07.858]  He said that they did not amount to a strategic terrorist event.
[00:27:08.559 --> 00:27:23.276]  Sir Richard, who was talking part in a debate on terrorism arranged by the city law firm, Ashurst, said the July attacks bore the characteristics of a locally planned and carried out event.
[00:27:23.316 --> 00:27:24.797]  Oh, I'd say locally planned.
[00:27:25.338 --> 00:27:27.761]  Right there at the MI6 building on the river.
[00:27:28.405 --> 00:27:35.011]  However, we probably had to conclude that the clock is running on some of the more dreadful events that could occur.
[00:27:35.051 --> 00:27:40.517]  And he went on to say that it could happen any time that a nuclear bomb or dirty bomb could go off.
[00:27:40.977 --> 00:27:53.549]  And our comment on this article is, Blair's former spy bosses are trying desperately to help him in the face of a Commons revolt and personal scandals derailing his police state agenda by bullying the British public into submission.
[00:27:53.949 --> 00:27:59.351]  And again, it's now come out that Blair has been covert MI6 all along, going back to college.
[00:28:00.131 --> 00:28:01.032]  All these presidents are.
[00:28:01.092 --> 00:28:03.633]  Bill Clinton, George Bush Sr., Bush Sr.
[00:28:04.193 --> 00:28:05.953]  They've been operatives since word one.
[00:28:07.394 --> 00:28:14.396]  It's like Putin is former KGB, or Jiang Zemin, or now his replacement, former intelligence service or military.
[00:28:14.756 --> 00:28:16.057]  I mean, that's who they put in.
[00:28:18.777 --> 00:28:19.518]  It's just amazing.
[00:28:19.558 --> 00:28:23.001]  So everywhere, to bolster their programs, they do this.
[00:28:23.401 --> 00:28:44.180]  Meanwhile, members of Parliament are telling the London Independent, and speaking in the House of Commons, that Mrs. Blair could end up as a criminal under new anti-terror laws, that if you support anyone who uses any force against the state, even verbally, it says that even glorification of Robin Hood is likely to be covered by this.
[00:28:44.742 --> 00:28:50.767]  For those that don't know, folks, they already have hate crime squads where hundreds are arrested in raids every week.
[00:28:50.807 --> 00:28:51.927]  This is BBC headlines.
[00:28:52.168 --> 00:28:58.893]  Hundreds netted in hate sweep because neighbors heard them whisper racial slurs under their breath.
[00:28:58.953 --> 00:29:02.395]  Now, whether you love that or hate that, that's freedom of speech, folks.
[00:29:04.517 --> 00:29:05.257]  Oh, it's amazing.
[00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:08.840]  Of course, it's all going to be selectively enforced to African immigrants.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.301]  One of the French were to the Africans.
[00:29:11.893 --> 00:29:13.154]  We're good to go.
[00:29:13.174 --> 00:29:13.774]  We're good to go.
[00:29:36.315 --> 00:29:37.756]  And it's just totally acceptable.
[00:29:38.196 --> 00:29:43.117]  And don't worry, everybody now in France, the law about it, will now lose their freedoms.
[00:29:44.177 --> 00:29:45.898]  It's just unbelievable.
[00:29:46.638 --> 00:29:47.258]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.278 --> 00:29:48.459]  Cover more news and take your calls.
[00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:48.899]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:52.900]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.981]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.881 --> 00:29:58.562]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.324 --> 00:30:05.126]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:30:05.246 --> 00:30:10.309]  We all eat sugars, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:16.712]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:30:16.993 --> 00:30:22.636]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:30:22.896 --> 00:30:28.402]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:30:28.642 --> 00:30:32.486]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:30:32.506 --> 00:30:37.792]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:30:37.972 --> 00:30:38.173]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:30:40.515 --> 00:30:44.619]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:30:44.779 --> 00:30:48.963]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:30:49.184 --> 00:30:52.086]  Well, with the Garricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[00:30:52.287 --> 00:30:57.211]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[00:30:57.412 --> 00:30:59.734]  A Garricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:31:01.761 --> 00:31:06.723]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[00:31:07.043 --> 00:31:12.485]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[00:31:12.505 --> 00:31:16.806]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[00:31:17.147 --> 00:31:20.168]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[00:31:20.468 --> 00:31:23.909]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[00:31:24.229 --> 00:31:33.596]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:31:33.856 --> 00:31:37.359]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[00:31:37.579 --> 00:31:44.684]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[00:31:44.944 --> 00:31:46.305]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.
[00:31:47.385 --> 00:31:51.828]  Get two for $70 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:32:02.333 --> 00:32:03.935]  Government is best with government police.
[00:32:04.495 --> 00:32:05.797]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:32:06.237 --> 00:32:08.960]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:12.023]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:32:12.483 --> 00:32:18.930]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:32:19.290 --> 00:32:22.454]  Get your stickers at LibertyStickers.com for your family, friends, and community.
[00:32:39.774 --> 00:32:41.235]  I've never voted for a war criminal.
[00:32:41.395 --> 00:32:41.736]  Have you?
[00:32:42.316 --> 00:32:43.817]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[00:32:44.297 --> 00:32:48.020]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[00:32:48.040 --> 00:32:52.042]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:32:52.482 --> 00:32:53.543]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:32:54.103 --> 00:32:55.284]  Osama bin forgotten.
[00:32:55.744 --> 00:32:59.367]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:33:15.672 --> 00:33:21.717]  Toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:21.737 --> 00:33:21.957]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:22.397 --> 00:33:36.128]  By the way, we're writing so many original articles, analysis, audio clips, video clips, so much information posted daily on InfoWars.com and PrisonBlinded.com and PrisonBlinded.tv and InfoWars.net as well.
[00:33:36.148 --> 00:33:38.610]  So be sure and check out all those sites on a daily basis.
[00:33:39.090 --> 00:33:40.331]  People say, well, which site's the best?
[00:33:40.371 --> 00:33:41.592]  Which site should I check out first?
[00:33:42.791 --> 00:33:48.953]  About 80% of the news or more on each site is the same as the other news you'll see on the other sites.
[00:33:49.273 --> 00:33:51.454]  They're all really kind of mirrors of each other.
[00:33:51.654 --> 00:34:01.497]  But for that 20% roughly is original articles written by particular writers we have or particular editors we have.
[00:34:02.637 --> 00:34:08.219]  So there's a good portion of media that is exclusive to each site.
[00:34:08.279 --> 00:34:10.340]  So that's the reason to visit them all.
[00:34:11.272 --> 00:34:17.234]  But really, we have a whole bunch of websites because we like to have them on different servers with different providers.
[00:34:18.354 --> 00:34:22.095]  Really, it's redundancy because years ago, we were attacked quite a bit.
[00:34:22.596 --> 00:34:23.976]  We never really whined about it much.
[00:34:24.036 --> 00:34:25.376]  We see that as a sign of success.
[00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:28.237]  I mean, high-level attacks, directly from the federal government.
[00:34:28.257 --> 00:34:29.098]  We even tracked them back.
[00:34:30.258 --> 00:34:34.639]  Not just denial of service and things like that, but zombie attacks and the rest of it.
[00:34:34.879 --> 00:34:36.180]  Those are all IT terms.
[00:34:36.220 --> 00:34:36.860]  I'm pretty ignorant.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:38.501]  I'm probably butchering them.
[00:34:38.541 --> 00:34:39.701]  But, you know, direct hacking.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.842]  Direct going in and defacing stuff.
[00:34:46.143 --> 00:34:55.427]  Going into the front page of the site and loading in a picture of a naked woman on a motorcycle.
[00:34:55.487 --> 00:34:56.128]  Stuff like that.
[00:34:56.188 --> 00:34:57.328]  So we launched it.
[00:34:58.669 --> 00:34:59.509]  Four websites.
[00:35:00.330 --> 00:35:02.651]  And there's about to be big changes at Infowars.com.
[00:35:03.922 --> 00:35:05.162]  It was redesigned months ago.
[00:35:05.182 --> 00:35:11.264]  We just haven't switched over yet to the quasi-blog format that's going to be integrated into some older HTML.
[00:35:11.304 --> 00:35:13.164]  But boring tech stuff.
[00:35:13.724 --> 00:35:14.985]  The point is, that's coming up.
[00:35:16.345 --> 00:35:20.846]  I want to get into a little bit more about the police state in England and how that mirrors what's happening here.
[00:35:21.006 --> 00:35:27.608]  And then more on Alito, supported abortion in three out of four cases.
[00:35:28.508 --> 00:35:32.349]  Of course, he's a gun-grabbing, abortion-loving, open-border-promoting globalist.
[00:35:32.961 --> 00:35:34.902]  And I'm a liberal for saying I'm against gun control.
[00:35:34.982 --> 00:35:35.562]  I understand.
[00:35:35.862 --> 00:35:39.364]  Look, I understand how this stuff operates.
[00:35:39.404 --> 00:35:40.044]  I figured it out.
[00:35:40.424 --> 00:35:43.405]  You guys don't care about conservatism or this country or our sovereignty.
[00:35:43.665 --> 00:35:45.906]  You care about licking Bush's boots, so go have fun.
[00:35:46.426 --> 00:35:48.007]  Blush your children's future down the toilet.
[00:35:48.267 --> 00:35:51.168]  But I do want to mention a little bit of that before we take some of your calls.
[00:35:52.469 --> 00:35:57.291]  But before I go any further, up on Infowars.com right now,
[00:35:58.283 --> 00:36:00.605]  And you link through to the secure online shopping cart.
[00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:08.151]  Here are some of the specials we're offering right now on books, videos, DVDs, books on tape, T-shirts.
[00:36:09.492 --> 00:36:11.853]  Police State Series Special.
[00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:16.577]  Three classic Alex Jones documentaries for one incredibly low price.
[00:36:16.997 --> 00:36:17.678]  Normally $77.85, now $44.95.
[00:36:17.718 --> 00:36:18.458]  I mean, do the math.
[00:36:18.478 --> 00:36:19.859]  That's more than a $30 discount.
[00:36:19.879 --> 00:36:21.541]  $44.95, all three of my Police State videos.
[00:36:27.273 --> 00:36:28.534]  That's a $32 discount.
[00:36:29.414 --> 00:36:33.037]  We have the DVD special blowout.
[00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:37.700]  9-11, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State, American Dictators, and 9-11 The Road to Tyranny.
[00:36:39.121 --> 00:36:41.743]  We're talking, I keep saying 7 plus hours.
[00:36:41.783 --> 00:36:43.744]  It's 8 plus hours of video.
[00:36:43.764 --> 00:36:47.707]  I mean, two of those films are miniseries themselves.
[00:36:47.747 --> 00:36:51.509]  So you're talking about two miniseries and a film for $44.95.
[00:36:51.689 --> 00:36:52.410]  It's just...
[00:36:54.631 --> 00:36:55.352]  It's a barn burner.
[00:36:55.592 --> 00:36:56.412]  Take advantage of that.
[00:36:56.833 --> 00:36:57.813]  It's a great Christmas gift.
[00:36:58.014 --> 00:36:59.255]  Give it to your friends and family.
[00:36:59.715 --> 00:37:00.576]  Use it to wake people up.
[00:37:00.636 --> 00:37:01.756]  Make copies of the films.
[00:37:03.978 --> 00:37:10.943]  And that is a $25 special on the DVD special.
[00:37:10.963 --> 00:37:13.085]  9-11 book special.
[00:37:13.145 --> 00:37:13.826]  You save $12.
[00:37:14.326 --> 00:37:14.586]  Normally $31.85.
[00:37:14.806 --> 00:37:22.232]  You get my book, 9-11 Descent to Tyranny, and Paul Watson's book, Border Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsor Terror, and The New World Order.
[00:37:24.056 --> 00:37:28.418]  And that is $19.95 for 500 plus pages.
[00:37:28.438 --> 00:37:31.860]  The two books combined, full of graphics, documents, you name it.
[00:37:32.701 --> 00:37:45.547]  And for a limited time only, when you order the two books special for $19.95, you get a 90 plus page color 9-11 The Great Illusion book as well by George Humphreys.
[00:37:45.587 --> 00:37:50.230]  A great primer for people that are big TV heads and worship world government and don't
[00:37:51.024 --> 00:37:54.545]  You don't really know how many states there are in the Union or don't know where Iraq is on a map.
[00:37:54.885 --> 00:37:57.106]  We found that these Great Illusion books are excellent.
[00:37:57.326 --> 00:37:59.486]  So one of those for free, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:38:01.107 --> 00:38:04.068]  Also, we have the amazing t-shirt deal.
[00:38:04.608 --> 00:38:07.308]  You get normally one t-shirt $19.95.
[00:38:08.029 --> 00:38:12.030]  Well, now it's $14.95 for one t-shirt and $13.95 for two t-shirts and $9.95...
[00:38:18.254 --> 00:38:22.677]  You save $30 when you get the three T-shirt special.
[00:38:22.757 --> 00:38:24.138]  Any three, any size you want.
[00:38:24.158 --> 00:38:25.059]  Three of the same.
[00:38:25.119 --> 00:38:25.819]  Three different ones.
[00:38:26.279 --> 00:38:27.180]  Three different sizes.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:27.901]  Whatever you want.
[00:38:27.941 --> 00:38:28.621]  It's easy to do.
[00:38:29.001 --> 00:38:31.323]  Right there on the shopping cart or by calling the toll-free number.
[00:38:31.943 --> 00:38:34.965]  And we really want you to take advantage of that and get three T-shirts for $29.95.
[00:38:35.426 --> 00:38:42.170]  And these deals are only going for another almost two months until the start of the new year.
[00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.551]  Then we're going to take these specials down.
[00:38:44.251 --> 00:38:46.593]  And we're doing this so you can get these as Christmas presents.
[00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.410]  I think so.
[00:38:53.010 --> 00:38:56.993]  You know, giving money to phony patriot networks run by charlatan scam artists.
[00:38:57.413 --> 00:38:59.454]  Not this network, other networks, you know what we're talking about.
[00:38:59.934 --> 00:39:16.705]  Instead of doing that, folks, what you do is you just get videos, you get books, you get t-shirts, you invest in things that are dynamic and powerful, but also in that support a show, a broadcast that you know is on the front lines of fighting the New World Order.
[00:39:17.165 --> 00:39:18.386]  So please take advantage of this.
[00:39:18.406 --> 00:39:19.647]  And there's a whole bunch of other specials.
[00:39:19.907 --> 00:39:21.768]  There's the Defend the Second Amendment special.
[00:39:22.629 --> 00:39:24.770]  A CD interview I did with Charlton Heston.
[00:39:25.751 --> 00:39:27.311]  A Second Amendment t-shirt.
[00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:34.415]  The JPFO film, Innocence Betrayed, about the history of mass murder after gun control.
[00:39:34.455 --> 00:39:36.376]  You can go on and on about this.
[00:39:39.937 --> 00:39:36.376]  $44.95.
[00:39:40.037 --> 00:39:41.518]  And it's a huge discount.
[00:39:42.118 --> 00:39:42.699]  A t-shirt.
[00:39:43.059 --> 00:39:43.639]  A video.
[00:39:44.059 --> 00:39:46.120]  Three Second Amendment booklets.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.361]  Grandpa Jack comic books.
[00:39:47.401 --> 00:39:48.401]  Great for waking people up.
[00:39:49.262 --> 00:39:51.623]  Charlton Heston CD interview.
[00:39:52.378 --> 00:39:56.161]  An interview he did here on the air right before he retired because of Alzheimer's.
[00:39:56.802 --> 00:39:57.422]  Great interview.
[00:39:57.823 --> 00:39:59.024]  And by the way, that's for a limited time.
[00:39:59.044 --> 00:40:02.707]  There's not many of those CDs that are left.
[00:40:02.947 --> 00:40:03.928]  I've never even offered them.
[00:40:04.008 --> 00:40:07.671]  I had a whole bunch of them printed up like four years ago and never sold them.
[00:40:07.711 --> 00:40:11.214]  I go, why do I have boxes of these and I haven't put it as part of a special?
[00:40:12.655 --> 00:40:15.097]  And there's the Everything Else special.
[00:40:15.197 --> 00:40:18.780]  Every book and DVD and everything we carry and book on tape.
[00:40:19.841 --> 00:40:20.582]  I mean, it's just...
[00:40:21.767 --> 00:40:24.629]  It's a whole catalog for $378, normally $420.
[00:40:24.990 --> 00:40:29.173]  All right, I've gone.
[00:40:29.954 --> 00:40:31.815]  Oh, there's the Everything Alex Jones special.
[00:40:32.696 --> 00:40:35.698]  And because these are our products, we can really slash the prices.
[00:40:36.018 --> 00:40:39.201]  Everything I've made, everything I've done, normally $320.
[00:40:39.241 --> 00:40:39.321]  Now $179.95.
[00:40:39.381 --> 00:40:39.941]  Folks, did you hear that?
[00:40:39.961 --> 00:40:40.322]  Normally $320.40.
[00:40:41.523 --> 00:40:41.723]  Now $179.95.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.382]  I mean, do you understand that's a cut?
[00:40:53.583 --> 00:40:54.224]  I've done the math.
[00:40:54.244 --> 00:40:55.506]  What is that, like 40% off?
[00:40:57.229 --> 00:40:59.472]  Everything.
[00:40:59.552 --> 00:40:59.472]  $179.95.
[00:40:59.612 --> 00:41:03.799]  So if you want to donate to us, you want to support us, that's how you do it.
[00:41:04.904 --> 00:41:07.865]  That's how you know you're getting materials that will fight the New World Order.
[00:41:07.885 --> 00:41:11.527]  That's how you know it's going towards fighting the New World Order 110%.
[00:41:11.947 --> 00:41:13.948]  I haven't really plugged these specials yet in detail.
[00:41:14.248 --> 00:41:16.429]  That's why I just spent six minutes doing it.
[00:41:16.930 --> 00:41:18.950]  And I appreciate folks holding while I did that.

[00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:08.156]  Let's just go to calls, and then I'll get into the abortion-loving Alito, your new Supreme Court communist.
[00:42:08.826 --> 00:42:13.190]  And just a bunch of other bird flu, total fair-mongering, a bunch of new developments.
[00:42:13.230 --> 00:42:15.371]  But let's just ram through some of these calls first.
[00:42:15.391 --> 00:42:16.692]  We've been holding long enough.
[00:42:16.732 --> 00:42:17.813]  We've got three guests coming up.
[00:42:18.394 --> 00:42:19.274]  Steve in Ohio.
[00:42:19.334 --> 00:42:19.855]  Go ahead, Steve.
[00:42:19.895 --> 00:42:20.395]  Thanks for holding.
[00:42:21.496 --> 00:42:23.698]  I just want to say, great show every day.
[00:42:23.738 --> 00:42:24.719]  I listen to you every day.
[00:42:25.399 --> 00:42:32.405]  But like you, I'm not listening and I'm not trying to do the right things for me, but for my kids.
[00:42:33.602 --> 00:42:34.704]  I just have a comment to you.
[00:42:35.224 --> 00:42:38.228]  I try and let my family listen with me on the program.
[00:42:38.268 --> 00:42:43.554]  I'm sure that there are a lot of families who want their kids to be educated properly in what's going on.
[00:42:44.655 --> 00:42:45.456]  I do have a comment.
[00:42:45.536 --> 00:42:48.540]  The last few weeks or so, I've heard some language that
[00:42:49.338 --> 00:42:58.385]  I almost feel like I can't allow my kids to listen, so I just want to, I guess, caution you about that, but there's got to be a lot of families that would love to listen to you, but that's a sensitive issue.
[00:42:58.545 --> 00:43:05.711]  Well, I mean, I've repeated what the President said when he said, I want that GD ship going to the bottom, and we've always tried to have higher standards here.
[00:43:06.011 --> 00:43:16.979]  Yeah, I mean, the SOB comment, I mean, those kind of things, to me, I know you get excited, and we all get excited and fervent about this, but I just want to let my kids listen.
[00:43:16.999 --> 00:43:19.101]  I like to let my kids listen, but they're pretty young, and
[00:43:19.727 --> 00:43:22.868]  So, you know, it's nice to know that... Well, let me say this, Steve.
[00:43:23.088 --> 00:43:24.669]  No one has called me on this.
[00:43:24.769 --> 00:43:34.013]  I've called myself on this, and I've always tried to have a higher standard than... I mean, I hear Rush Limbaugh making jokes about football team orgies, wishing he could be part of it.
[00:43:34.233 --> 00:43:35.453]  Oh, yeah, I mean, he's bad.
[00:43:35.514 --> 00:43:37.314]  I mean, he's gotten really bad.
[00:43:37.434 --> 00:43:37.674]  Yeah.
[00:43:37.955 --> 00:43:42.756]  And, you know, I just try to be myself, and I'm going to be quite honest with you.
[00:43:42.837 --> 00:43:48.119]  I'm someone who's never used a lot of profanity, but I've been working with a lot of people and doing a lot of stuff, and...
[00:43:49.392 --> 00:43:51.593]  And I'm not going to get into details.
[00:43:51.833 --> 00:43:59.836]  I do need to watch even... Not that it's not even profanity, but just... You know, I did say SOB about FEMA saying George Washington's a terrorist.
[00:44:00.496 --> 00:44:01.257]  And you know what?
[00:44:01.377 --> 00:44:03.998]  I don't even know if you can really say that's profanity.
[00:44:04.618 --> 00:44:07.939]  I mean, I'm saying you are the son of a dog.
[00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:14.542]  I mean, I don't really know if... I mean, obviously, you don't want your kids running around saying SOB.
[00:44:15.622 --> 00:44:16.683]  But, I mean, I...
[00:44:17.927 --> 00:44:23.369]  That is real emotion coming through, and I do have to curb my enthusiasm and not encourage that.
[00:44:23.389 --> 00:44:24.170]  And it is true.
[00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:25.730]  I encourage all the listeners not to use it.
[00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:27.291]  In the past, I wouldn't tolerate any of it.
[00:44:28.011 --> 00:44:30.132]  Stuff's getting right up here to the edge right now.
[00:44:30.192 --> 00:44:31.353]  Everybody can feel it right now.
[00:44:32.827 --> 00:44:35.169]  We're on the edge of this going from Cold War to Hot War.
[00:44:35.669 --> 00:44:37.851]  And I've been kind of letting it all hang out, as they say.
[00:44:39.272 --> 00:44:40.773]  Or getting it on, as they say.
[00:44:40.813 --> 00:44:41.634]  Getting the fight on.
[00:44:42.115 --> 00:44:44.937]  And so I've been pretty charged up, pretty amped up, pretty fired up.
[00:44:45.017 --> 00:44:45.838]  Right.
[00:44:47.319 --> 00:44:48.280]  But no, I appreciate you.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.622]  I appreciate legitimate criticism.
[00:44:50.762 --> 00:44:51.943]  Because listen, I'm a human being.
[00:44:52.543 --> 00:44:53.424]  Well, we all are.
[00:44:54.004 --> 00:44:56.326]  Two other quick comments.
[00:44:56.967 --> 00:44:57.988]  Every program...
[00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:03.615]  We hear about what the government's doing and the things that are going on, which are bad.
[00:45:04.436 --> 00:45:14.686]  It would be great to put out some sort of a five things or ten things that we as everyday common ordinary citizens can and should be doing
[00:45:15.276 --> 00:45:19.499]  To combat this and make a difference in our community.
[00:45:19.659 --> 00:45:20.900]  This is what I want the listeners to do.
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:29.966]  I want every listener out there to think about this and write up the ten things that you think we should do and to email them all to tips at infowars.com.
[00:45:30.506 --> 00:45:39.252]  And we'll put them all together in some big 100-page article using the best ones we get with the ten things we can do.
[00:45:39.312 --> 00:45:41.934]  I'd like to hear your ideas, so send me those emails.
[00:45:42.394 --> 00:45:44.295]  And tell us right now, what are some of the things we can do?
[00:45:44.836 --> 00:45:45.036]  Great.
[00:45:45.655 --> 00:45:49.097]  The one last comment I have... Tell me, what's your idea on what we should do?
[00:45:49.617 --> 00:45:53.119]  Well, I think first and foremost, we need to preach the Word of God.
[00:45:53.819 --> 00:45:59.202]  That's how we can make a difference in the hearts and lives of everyday people and get them thinking about...
[00:45:59.988 --> 00:46:01.109]  What is right and what is wrong.
[00:46:01.129 --> 00:46:04.412]  But that doesn't mean the 550 counterfeits that are out there.
[00:46:04.592 --> 00:46:05.052]  Exactly.
[00:46:05.773 --> 00:46:10.476]  Which is why I end up steering away from the whole thing, because most of these preachers, that's where you find the devils in church.
[00:46:10.877 --> 00:46:16.621]  But me personally, I'm not really sure what I literally can be doing.
[00:46:18.587 --> 00:46:26.369]  So that's why I asked that question, not because I have all the answers, because I'm looking for, you know, what are some five or six things that I should and can't be doing?
[00:46:26.389 --> 00:46:29.050]  Well, this is a long-term battle, and I appreciate your call.
[00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:31.710]  Number one, raise your children.
[00:46:32.491 --> 00:46:34.011]  Now, this is something I've studied, looked at.
[00:46:34.691 --> 00:46:38.972]  I didn't invent this idea, though it's a rare idea.
[00:46:39.072 --> 00:46:44.874]  But I observed it from primitive cultures where you really don't see the children revolting against their elders.
[00:46:45.513 --> 00:47:07.286]  I observed it in wartime situations from studying war, that if you take children and you explain to them there's a danger and there's an enemy that wants to get them, and we're a family, we're a tribe, we're together, we're your elders, and if you really are a man, I don't mean act like a man, there's a lot of it, but if you are a man and try to impart to them by the time they're about five years of age...
[00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:08.631]  We're good to go.
[00:47:31.575 --> 00:47:38.017]  But really, the government ships them in, and they want to catch you with the drugs to put you in a private prison openly owned by the drug dealer.
[00:47:38.457 --> 00:47:42.058]  They explain how it's a trap, how they actually trap you.
[00:47:42.978 --> 00:47:53.120]  And you go through this, and you go, and if you have to, take your child down and show them the mental institution with people that had mental breakdowns because of drugs, legal and illegal.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:57.241]  You take them and you show them crack whores on the side of the street.
[00:47:58.004 --> 00:48:06.772]  I mean, I remember driving around in Dallas with my dad as a child when he was going to do business, and he'd see some drug addicts, junkies, and he'd pull over and he'd park in a parking lot.
[00:48:06.792 --> 00:48:07.593]  I just did it a few times.
[00:48:07.773 --> 00:48:08.854]  Look at those drug addicts.
[00:48:08.894 --> 00:48:09.234]  Look at them.
[00:48:09.254 --> 00:48:10.115]  Look how unhappy they are.
[00:48:10.135 --> 00:48:11.477]  Look at how they're all dirty.
[00:48:11.697 --> 00:48:12.878]  You see, they didn't listen to their parents.
[00:48:12.918 --> 00:48:19.144]  They thought it was cool to use these drugs, but it ruins your mind and makes you where you can't be happy anymore.
[00:48:19.404 --> 00:48:23.828]  But the culture sells it like it's cool and like it's alternative, but really it's just destructive.
[00:48:25.006 --> 00:48:26.126]  Well, see, I take it one further.
[00:48:26.186 --> 00:48:28.527]  I will tell my children, and I already do, by the way.
[00:48:28.547 --> 00:48:30.847]  I already tell my three-year-old this stuff, and he understands it.
[00:48:31.528 --> 00:48:48.672]  You know, you explain to them that the police were once good, but now they've been taken over by private interest, and that they are now, again, working for a private group of criminals that seeks to basically feed off of us, and that sometimes they can still help us, but overall, that they've been corrupted.
[00:48:49.341 --> 00:48:51.022]  I mean, you really have to do this, folks.
[00:48:51.602 --> 00:48:56.504]  And so if you raise your children that the family's all they've got, they've got to defend that family.
[00:48:56.544 --> 00:48:58.164]  You teach them about family heritage.
[00:48:58.565 --> 00:49:00.185]  You teach them about their ancestors.
[00:49:00.926 --> 00:49:05.247]  And that will trigger innate, instinctive drives that God put in us.
[00:49:05.447 --> 00:49:06.988]  And once you turn those drives on,
[00:49:08.169 --> 00:49:13.472]  And get your children into those drive states of real tribalism, not hating the black people next door.
[00:49:13.733 --> 00:49:14.973]  That's an aberration of it.
[00:49:15.394 --> 00:49:19.937]  But tribalism is defending ideas, defending your family, defending your wife, defending your...
[00:49:21.474 --> 00:49:22.555]  Your brothers and sisters.
[00:49:23.175 --> 00:49:24.196]  Getting back to that.
[00:49:24.336 --> 00:49:25.356]  Family comes first.
[00:49:25.917 --> 00:49:28.318]  I don't care if somebody in your family is doing something wrong.
[00:49:28.698 --> 00:49:33.701]  If it's not violent and it's not abusive to somebody else, don't rat them out.
[00:49:34.062 --> 00:49:34.762]  Now, they are.
[00:49:35.222 --> 00:49:38.004]  Try to fix it, but if you can't, then you have to do something about it.
[00:49:38.084 --> 00:49:40.786]  I called the police on my son because he had marijuana.
[00:49:41.266 --> 00:49:46.189]  Just because you teach your children drugs are bad, if you find them with drugs, you go, well, you're a fool now.
[00:49:46.249 --> 00:49:46.989]  See what you've done?
[00:49:47.029 --> 00:49:48.230]  You're destroying yourself.
[00:49:48.986 --> 00:49:49.807]  We're good to go.
[00:49:49.847 --> 00:49:50.127]  I think?
[00:50:02.452 --> 00:50:02.972]  About this.
[00:50:03.473 --> 00:50:10.197]  But if you don't come at it as, I'm dominating you, I'm telling you, you better do as I say or I'm going to do this and that to you.
[00:50:10.498 --> 00:50:24.107]  No, if you give them responsibilities at a young age and then commend them for that and engineer that sense of worth into them because of that independence, then it's going to be amazing.
[00:50:25.368 --> 00:50:29.791]  I mean, obviously your children shouldn't watch TV, they shouldn't be in public school, that peer pressure will ruin them.
[00:50:31.003 --> 00:50:38.668]  You should take them out in the woods for a couple weeks a year when they get old enough and live off the land, teach them self-sufficiency.
[00:50:39.149 --> 00:50:47.314]  You should teach them about the Second Amendment, teach them about the Founding Fathers, teach them about struggle, teach them about the struggle against dehumanization and enslavement.
[00:50:48.154 --> 00:50:51.817]  And believe me, by the time your children are 12 years old, folks, you're not going to have to work.
[00:50:53.838 --> 00:50:56.059]  I mean, look, we're supposed to be adults by the time we're 13 or 14 years old.
[00:50:57.415 --> 00:50:59.717]  They keep us as children now until we're 30 years old.
[00:51:00.117 --> 00:51:01.018]  That's my design.
[00:51:02.959 --> 00:51:05.821]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:06.082 --> 00:51:06.762]  Hello, my friends.

[00:51:13.007 --> 00:51:19.732]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:20.052 --> 00:51:22.034]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.234 --> 00:51:25.097]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:25.177 --> 00:51:29.841]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:30.041 --> 00:51:34.465]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.705 --> 00:51:41.912]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:42.172 --> 00:51:44.594]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:15.185 --> 00:52:18.671]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[00:52:18.931 --> 00:52:19.391]  We're good to go.
[00:52:40.057 --> 00:52:40.497]  We're good to go.
[00:52:40.537 --> 00:52:41.158]  We're good to go.
[00:52:41.218 --> 00:52:41.778]  We're good to go.
[00:53:02.938 --> 00:53:08.860]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:11.341]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.541 --> 00:53:17.903]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:18.283 --> 00:53:18.883]  I think so.
[00:53:33.792 --> 00:53:34.192]  We're good to go.
[00:54:02.801 --> 00:54:07.945]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.625 --> 00:54:10.987]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:11.007 --> 00:54:22.675]  Everything George Bush is doing is diametrically opposed to the Republican Party platform.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:31.959]  Anti-gun judges, pro-abortion judges, open-border promoting bureaucrats over the federal agencies.
[00:54:33.312 --> 00:54:34.373]  It's unbelievable.
[00:54:34.573 --> 00:54:52.920]  And I literally had one of my friends, who's a big neocon, last night at the TV station, argue with me, and he said, George Bush is anointed of God, is controlled by God, he's too stupid physically, he's actually possessed by God, and God is controlling Bush, and Bush basically is some type of Christ creature.
[00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.841]  And I said, so he's like Jesus?
[00:54:55.881 --> 00:54:58.162]  He said, well, yes, basically, he's like Jesus.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.621]  So now Bush is Jesus.
[00:55:01.161 --> 00:55:03.723]  Would Jesus appoint people that are pro-abortion?
[00:55:03.803 --> 00:55:04.444]  I guess so.
[00:55:04.464 --> 00:55:06.085]  I mean, according to this sicko.
[00:55:07.466 --> 00:55:08.807]  And again, that's my old friend.
[00:55:08.847 --> 00:55:09.848]  I shouldn't call him a sicko.
[00:55:09.868 --> 00:55:13.291]  According to his sick, twisted mind.
[00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:16.833]  And if there was any doubt about where U.S.
[00:55:16.853 --> 00:55:25.320]  Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito stands on abortion, his 90-year-old mother quickly and decisively put the question to rest.
[00:55:28.171 --> 00:55:29.993]  And it goes on, of course he's against abortion.
[00:55:30.313 --> 00:55:34.557]  Rose Alito told the Associated Press in a telephone interview from her Hamilton, New Jersey home.
[00:55:35.077 --> 00:55:40.822]  Her candid statement may go down in history as the most blunt and honest admission of the Supreme Court nominee's view of the hot-button issue.
[00:55:41.342 --> 00:55:45.326]  But the true test of appeals court judge isn't which their personal views they hold.
[00:55:46.013 --> 00:55:46.734]  Let's double think.
[00:55:47.114 --> 00:55:50.577]  But to what extent those personal views may influence how they rule in particular cases?
[00:55:50.957 --> 00:55:51.798]  Well, no kidding.
[00:55:52.198 --> 00:55:55.421]  On the issue, legal analysts disagree on their assessment of Judge Alito.
[00:55:55.782 --> 00:55:57.583]  Some say he is conservative ideologue.
[00:55:57.703 --> 00:55:58.384]  Neocons do.
[00:55:59.004 --> 00:56:05.170]  Others say he is a smart, careful jurist who leaves personal views behind when he dons his black robes.
[00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:09.814]  But in three of four abortion cases, he ruled in favor of abortion.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:13.442]  It's the same thing with Roberts, folks.
[00:56:13.882 --> 00:56:14.722]  He's anti-gun.
[00:56:14.763 --> 00:56:17.084]  CBS News now proudly reports.
[00:56:17.825 --> 00:56:18.545]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:56:18.986 --> 00:56:19.746]  We're in deep trouble.
[00:56:20.106 --> 00:56:22.248]  Seven of the nine up there doing all this horrible stuff.
[00:56:22.308 --> 00:56:23.449]  Land grabbing, gun grabbing.
[00:56:23.729 --> 00:56:26.151]  The last few years are put in by Republicans.
[00:56:27.972 --> 00:56:30.094]  And I've told Democrats, you should love George Bush.
[00:56:30.134 --> 00:56:36.338]  If you really love Hillary Clinton, and you really love Bill Clinton, they're for the war, they're for attacking Syria, they're for all this stuff.
[00:56:36.899 --> 00:56:39.701]  The Democrats on almost every issue are out-bushing Bush.
[00:56:40.376 --> 00:56:42.457]  And on some issues, he's out Clinton and Clinton.
[00:56:43.358 --> 00:56:45.859]  There's no difference in action, just in rhetoric.
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:48.421]  I just never get over this.
[00:56:49.101 --> 00:56:51.082]  Let's go to Brent in Michigan.
[00:56:51.122 --> 00:56:51.662]  Brent, go ahead.
[00:56:51.702 --> 00:56:52.183]  Thanks for holding.
[00:56:52.603 --> 00:56:53.063]  Sure thing.
[00:56:53.103 --> 00:56:53.864]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[00:56:54.044 --> 00:56:54.284]  Hi.
[00:56:55.264 --> 00:56:59.007]  I heard that you were going to have Mr. Thomas Naylor on at the end of the show today.
[00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:03.169]  Yes, about Vermont pulling out of the union, the move to do that.
[00:57:03.389 --> 00:57:03.929]  Exactly.
[00:57:04.009 --> 00:57:08.432]  My heart did a flip-flop, and the reason being, over the last couple days,
[00:57:09.557 --> 00:57:35.111]  I've come across some articles regarding that, the Second Vermont Republic, and I did some research on the people that were speaking at those conventions, Mr. Naylor, someone named Kunstler, Kirkpatrick, a bunch of different names, and it seems that everything these people have written falls totally in line with sustainability, Agenda 21,
[00:57:36.542 --> 00:57:37.503]  All those kinds of things.
[00:57:37.523 --> 00:57:41.947]  So I think it would be incredibly pertinent if you would grill him on that.
[00:57:42.868 --> 00:57:47.732]  If you can get him to come to the table with how he feels about those kind of issues.
[00:57:47.772 --> 00:57:52.916]  Well, for those that don't know, sustainability equals feudalism, serfdom.
[00:57:53.537 --> 00:58:01.243]  And it's the excuse to put us in compact cities, force us off the land, totally enslave us, tax the daylights out of us.
[00:58:01.444 --> 00:58:02.725]  That's the public plan.
[00:58:02.805 --> 00:58:04.046]  Nothing to do with the environment.
[00:58:04.757 --> 00:58:07.979]  And it's a nice little, you know, it's like communism is now progressive.
[00:58:08.019 --> 00:58:15.043]  And I've said, too bad the Republic of Texas was run by a bunch of crazy morons.
[00:58:15.644 --> 00:58:17.445]  And what you're saying is true about this.
[00:58:17.465 --> 00:58:19.206]  I'm just saying the idea towards this is good.
[00:58:20.807 --> 00:58:23.148]  If it is kind of a socialist movement, we'll find out.
[00:58:23.768 --> 00:58:26.310]  And again, that's why good people need to get involved.
[00:58:26.970 --> 00:58:29.252]  Evil men and tyrants flourish when good men do nothing.
[00:58:29.512 --> 00:58:31.553]  If I can hold two, I have one more point.
[00:58:31.573 --> 00:58:32.894]  Well, Brett, we're out of time.
[00:58:33.174 --> 00:58:35.196]  Why don't you call back in the third hour when he's on?
[00:58:35.236 --> 00:58:35.756]  Can you do that?
[00:58:36.176 --> 00:58:36.597]  I will try.
[00:58:36.617 --> 00:58:37.397]  All right.
[00:58:37.857 --> 00:58:38.758]  Vaya con Dios.
[00:58:38.798 --> 00:58:40.099]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:45.562]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:45.883 --> 00:58:46.663]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:58.025 --> 00:58:58.665]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.346 --> 00:59:00.386]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.106 --> 00:59:02.227]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.887 --> 00:59:03.668]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.428 --> 00:59:05.409]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.009 --> 00:59:09.791]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.191 --> 00:59:14.314]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.757 --> 00:59:20.938]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:21.138 --> 00:59:21.739]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:21.819 --> 00:59:23.400]  Central Standard Time.
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:27.242]  Back live from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:59:27.743 --> 00:59:28.723]  We're here, my friends.
[00:59:28.803 --> 00:59:30.585]  We've got several great guests coming up.
[00:59:31.205 --> 00:59:36.569]  David Swanson, co-founder of the AfterDowningstreet.org and Bush's Real Approval Ratings.
[00:59:37.427 --> 00:59:38.688]  We'll be talking about that.
[00:59:38.848 --> 00:59:48.676]  Coming up in 30 minutes, Craig Mononam, Organic Consumers Association, scientist on how Congress has rammed through a sneak attack on organic standards.
[00:59:48.976 --> 00:59:49.657]  Wait until you hear this.
[00:59:49.717 --> 00:59:50.678]  It's very important.
[00:59:51.218 --> 00:59:59.264]  And then Thomas H. Naylor, founder of the Second Vermont Republic Movement, which is pushing a resolution to have Vermont pull out of the union.
[01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:03.708]  So we'll get into that coming up a little bit later.
[01:00:04.569 --> 01:00:07.250]  Right now, let's go back to your calls.
[01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:09.712]  Let's talk to Lee in Indiana.
[01:00:09.772 --> 01:00:10.432]  Lee, go ahead.
[01:00:10.852 --> 01:00:22.678]  Yeah, I'm curious what effect you think resolutions against the Patriot Act and videos and things are going to have against tanks and foreign troops when they cut this bird flu and martial law against us.
[01:00:24.662 --> 01:00:26.102]  Well, you know what they do?
[01:00:26.542 --> 01:00:41.246]  It means the police officers, and it means the military, and it means that members of Congress, like Ron Paul and many others, are speaking up, and the state rep out in Arizona who said if martial law is declared, they'll pull out of the union, and they'll resist.
[01:00:41.306 --> 01:00:43.686]  It means that public opinion will be against it.
[01:00:43.726 --> 01:00:46.067]  It's like when the gun confiscation began in New Orleans.
[01:00:46.447 --> 01:00:48.607]  We screamed bloody murder for the first two days.
[01:00:48.647 --> 01:00:49.688]  People didn't believe us.
[01:00:50.128 --> 01:00:51.148]  Finally, people did believe us.
[01:00:51.906 --> 01:00:55.147]  I found out it was true and there was a giant backlash and it stopped.
[01:00:55.548 --> 01:00:57.088]  But they didn't get their guns back.
[01:00:58.069 --> 01:01:01.670]  Yeah, well, so I guess I shouldn't talk on the air.
[01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:03.571]  Why are you even calling into a show?
[01:01:03.771 --> 01:01:11.995]  Well, I just noticed that it seems like the globalists go after those who are advocating physically fighting against them instead of these parliamentary maneuvers.
[01:01:12.455 --> 01:01:14.736]  And I remember what you did to Mark Kroenke's show in November 2003, liar!
[01:01:17.165 --> 01:01:18.026]  You're a liar, Alex.
[01:01:18.046 --> 01:01:19.147]  I don't even know what that means.
[01:01:19.447 --> 01:01:22.349]  Well, you helped get his show off the air, and people should research this.
[01:01:22.449 --> 01:01:24.050]  Don't take my word for it.
[01:01:24.611 --> 01:01:25.572]  Your name's Larry, isn't it?
[01:01:25.592 --> 01:01:27.173]  Yeah, it is, Alex, and you're a liar.
[01:01:27.193 --> 01:01:28.234]  Thanks for the call.
[01:01:28.794 --> 01:01:31.356]  I mean, this is the type of insanity I talk about right here.
[01:01:32.297 --> 01:01:36.600]  I mean, I got a plaque hanging on my wall from Mark Kornke that he sent me from prison.
[01:01:37.501 --> 01:01:39.483]  And then you just sit there and make up stuff.
[01:01:40.503 --> 01:01:41.644]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:01:42.485 --> 01:01:43.626]  I can never figure that out.
[01:01:44.304 --> 01:01:49.586]  There are like a hundred postings on the internet saying I run Genesis and I decide who's on the air.
[01:01:49.946 --> 01:01:52.127]  I have absolutely no programming decisions.
[01:01:52.567 --> 01:01:54.828]  I talk to Ted Anderson probably every two weeks.
[01:01:56.129 --> 01:02:04.912]  And the network was gracious enough to let you do a show when somebody was in prison and you savaged them for month after month.
[01:02:05.312 --> 01:02:06.873]  And they finally said, C'est la vie?
[01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:19.468]  I mean, people ought to be mad at you that you lost somebody's show for them, and then you've got the nerve to drag me into it and lie about me?
[01:02:20.548 --> 01:02:21.769]  I'm so tired of it.
[01:02:22.690 --> 01:02:24.791]  I mean, just the lies out there.
[01:02:24.911 --> 01:02:28.253]  You know, how I hurt Christian family and did this and that.
[01:02:28.554 --> 01:02:28.954]  Made up.
[01:02:29.134 --> 01:02:29.834]  Total theater.
[01:02:30.135 --> 01:02:31.676]  It's like saying I'm the Loch Ness Monster.
[01:02:31.896 --> 01:02:33.717]  It has as much validity...
[01:02:34.855 --> 01:02:38.176]  And then you call in sneering, calling for violence.
[01:02:38.196 --> 01:02:41.176]  Hey, go post your name and tell everybody your real name.
[01:02:41.216 --> 01:02:43.017]  I'm sure that other name you use is fake too.
[01:02:43.317 --> 01:02:45.177]  And call for violence and see what happens to you.
[01:02:45.197 --> 01:02:47.757]  I mean, you people are incredible.
[01:02:48.378 --> 01:02:56.459]  I'm here trying to... You don't like it that we're not trying to radicalize people and get them in trouble and get them all to go out and do something violent.
[01:02:57.399 --> 01:03:01.080]  I guess it upsets you that we're effective and the poll numbers are going in our direction now.
[01:03:02.143 --> 01:03:04.885]  And that we're actually starting to win.
[01:03:05.786 --> 01:03:13.092]  And that I'm on the air on AM and FM stations all over the country, exposing martial law and fighting it so they may not be able to pull it off.
[01:03:13.472 --> 01:03:18.896]  You know, we effectively stopped before smallpox inoculation with talk radio.
[01:03:18.916 --> 01:03:21.138]  I mean, we effectively did that.
[01:03:21.679 --> 01:03:24.441]  We effectively are exposing this bird flu thing being a fraud.
[01:03:25.061 --> 01:03:28.504]  We are effectively doing this, and you just call it... You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[01:03:28.524 --> 01:03:30.986]  The things you say about me, Larry, are lies.
[01:03:31.846 --> 01:03:32.507]  And you know that.
[01:03:33.308 --> 01:03:34.229]  I don't know why.
[01:03:34.249 --> 01:03:38.133]  It's just, at every level it's a lot.
[01:03:39.214 --> 01:03:46.041]  I have nothing to do with programming decisions, and I think the programming decision they made after I heard about it in the aftermath was an excellent one.
[01:03:46.061 --> 01:03:47.363]  It was excellent.
[01:03:49.030 --> 01:03:50.892]  If I did have that power, I would kick you off.
[01:03:50.932 --> 01:03:53.094]  You're a travesty.
[01:03:53.635 --> 01:03:57.959]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:02.604]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.724 --> 01:04:07.109]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.149 --> 01:04:08.491]  The New World Order.
[01:04:10.271 --> 01:04:14.493]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.553 --> 01:04:21.495]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.595 --> 01:04:23.696]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.856 --> 01:04:34.340]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:35.520]  If you want to understand...
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:36.041]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:36.081 --> 01:04:37.583]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:53.183 --> 01:04:54.783]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.144 --> 01:05:00.885]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:01.145 --> 01:05:06.286]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:06.607 --> 01:05:15.889]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:16.249 --> 01:05:21.212]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:21.532 --> 01:05:25.534]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:25.734 --> 01:05:30.497]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:30.877 --> 01:05:36.780]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:46.153]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:05:47.395 --> 01:05:48.436]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.657 --> 01:05:56.258]  Government is best, which governs least.
[01:05:56.819 --> 01:05:58.119]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:01.261]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:01.702 --> 01:06:04.363]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:04.804 --> 01:06:11.248]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:06:11.448 --> 01:06:12.209]  We're good to go.
[01:06:32.086 --> 01:06:33.548]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:06:33.708 --> 01:06:34.048]  Have you?
[01:06:34.068 --> 01:06:36.150]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:06:40.373 --> 01:06:44.357]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:06:44.837 --> 01:06:45.878]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:06:46.438 --> 01:06:47.619]  Osama bin forgotten.

[01:06:58.141 --> 01:06:58.782]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.442 --> 01:07:00.523]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.223 --> 01:07:02.324]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.964 --> 01:07:03.785]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.545 --> 01:07:05.426]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.126 --> 01:07:09.808]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:14.391]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:24.986 --> 01:07:27.428]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:28.749 --> 01:07:29.630]  We're here live.
[01:07:29.650 --> 01:07:35.274]  Now eight minutes, 38 seconds into this second hour, second segment of the second hour.
[01:07:35.794 --> 01:07:38.557]  Websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[01:07:39.337 --> 01:07:45.362]  We have President Bush, when he was governor in 99, telling his biographer, I want to be a wartime president.
[01:07:45.422 --> 01:07:46.523]  I'm going to start wars.
[01:07:47.913 --> 01:07:52.495]  Because no one can question me when I'm a wartime president.
[01:07:52.955 --> 01:08:01.057]  And then there's all the opium money, the weapons sales money, the trillions of dollars in oil they secure and then don't let flow and artificially jack up prices.
[01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:06.399]  We have the memos from the oil companies shutting down refineries on purpose to create an artificial bottleneck.
[01:08:06.539 --> 01:08:07.499]  All of this is documented.
[01:08:07.879 --> 01:08:09.420]  The Enron's scamming all of it.
[01:08:10.487 --> 01:08:12.768]  And Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, they're all involved.
[01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:13.749]  They're all for the war.
[01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:15.870]  They're all involved with the same scams.
[01:08:15.950 --> 01:08:16.810]  It's totally staged.
[01:08:17.050 --> 01:08:23.073]  I've told the left over and over again, if you love Bill Clinton, you should love George Bush.
[01:08:24.034 --> 01:08:29.317]  And they just don't want to hear it because they're into rhetoric.
[01:08:29.777 --> 01:08:33.539]  They're not into reality, what these politicians are doing.
[01:08:33.559 --> 01:08:39.902]  But more and more people from across the political spectrum, whether they call themselves right-wing or left-wing, just are seeing the out-of-control...
[01:08:41.167 --> 01:08:41.807]  We're good to go.
[01:09:03.848 --> 01:09:10.712]  The threat of weapons of mass destruction as the pretext to secure the oil and use Iraq as a military launch base for Iran and Syria.
[01:09:10.752 --> 01:09:12.313]  I mean, that's not Clark saying it.
[01:09:12.333 --> 01:09:13.474]  That's not Alex Jones saying it.
[01:09:13.494 --> 01:09:14.835]  It's not anybody saying it.
[01:09:14.855 --> 01:09:15.815]  It's Dick Cheney.
[01:09:16.075 --> 01:09:16.976]  But that all gets ignored.
[01:09:17.316 --> 01:09:23.620]  Then the Downing Street memo comes out where the top Blair people are in there going, they're going to go to war.
[01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:24.501]  We've got to lie about it.
[01:09:24.541 --> 01:09:27.463]  We've got to create some fake propaganda for them.
[01:09:28.463 --> 01:09:29.664]  This is smoking guns.
[01:09:30.777 --> 01:09:36.239]  It's like a serial killer videotaping, you know, when he disembowels people, and the cops catch him and they got the video of it.
[01:09:36.599 --> 01:09:37.820]  It's called Slam Dunk.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.201]  Oh, but they called it a Slam Dunk, pun intended.
[01:09:40.981 --> 01:09:43.082]  And we're supposed to forget about the Downing Street Memo.
[01:09:43.122 --> 01:09:48.344]  Just one of a whole squadron, a whole galaxy of lies.
[01:09:49.504 --> 01:09:52.185]  And now the neocons are on the radio saying it was never about war.
[01:09:52.205 --> 01:09:55.086]  I mean, it was never about WMDs.
[01:09:55.106 --> 01:09:58.188]  It was about bringing democracy, bringing freedom.
[01:09:58.228 --> 01:09:59.228]  And you read the Constitution...
[01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:01.516]  It's like the UN Charter.
[01:10:01.556 --> 01:10:08.941]  At the bottom of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the first 29 things are good, but 30 and 31 say you don't have any of these rights that we say.
[01:10:10.122 --> 01:10:10.743]  So it's a joke.
[01:10:10.763 --> 01:10:13.845]  It's like the Soviet Bill of Rights in Russia or China.
[01:10:14.918 --> 01:10:15.939]  And it's not freedom.
[01:10:15.959 --> 01:10:17.480]  They put the Baptists back into power.
[01:10:17.521 --> 01:10:25.588]  They created racial politics and tribal politics between those who consider themselves Persians and Arabs and Sunni and Shiite and Wahhabi and all this.
[01:10:25.668 --> 01:10:28.170]  And we've got Pentagon memos saying they want civil war.
[01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:30.812]  They want it to fall apart so they can stay there for decades.
[01:10:31.213 --> 01:10:32.394]  Failure is the plan.
[01:10:32.554 --> 01:10:41.302]  Because failure in bringing them peace and getting out of the country... Do the defense contractors want to be there one year and make a little bit of money or be there ten years and make trillions?
[01:10:42.176 --> 01:10:43.657]  They want to be there 10 years and make trillions.
[01:10:44.037 --> 01:10:52.920]  So joining us is David Swanson, co-founder of AfterDowningStreet.org, and Bush's real approval rating after the Downing Street memo.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:54.920]  And we hear every week it's plunging, plunging, plunging.
[01:10:55.221 --> 01:11:03.363]  A lot of the real polls I trust have got him at 29% to 30% like Zogby, but CBS News has him at 35% and only 34% approve of his work.
[01:11:06.019 --> 01:11:09.101]  And once you hit this level, you just free fall.
[01:11:09.781 --> 01:11:12.743]  Thank you so much for coming on with us for a few minutes, David Swanson.
[01:11:13.123 --> 01:11:17.526]  And thank you for trying to keep a focus on what's happening with the Downing Street Memos.
[01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:19.547]  Oh, thanks very much for having me.
[01:11:19.987 --> 01:11:20.308]  You bet.
[01:11:20.528 --> 01:11:23.890]  Tell us about your organization and why you guys started it and what you focus on.
[01:11:24.610 --> 01:11:27.832]  We are a coalition of over 100 organizations.
[01:11:27.952 --> 01:11:34.416]  A lot of peace groups, community groups, military families, veterans groups, all opposed to the war and all...
[01:11:35.103 --> 01:11:38.224]  ...seeking to hold accountable those who sold us the war.
[01:11:38.925 --> 01:11:51.411]  We put the organization together as a coalition back in the middle of May when the Downing Street Memo was huge news in Europe but was unheard of here, and we hammered away at Congress and at the media.
[01:11:52.111 --> 01:11:56.373]  We made it a front-page story by the middle of June, then it was forgotten again by the end of June.
[01:11:56.633 --> 01:11:58.234]  The attention span didn't last.
[01:11:59.274 --> 01:12:04.537]  But we've since been pushing numerous measures in Congress with...
[01:12:05.307 --> 01:12:20.781]  With some encouraging results, including a resolution of inquiry that Congressman Kucinich has that's moving forward, and what we saw Harry Reid do two days ago and Nancy Pelosi do today is a result of public pressure.
[01:12:23.323 --> 01:12:24.504]  Now, specifically...
[01:12:25.626 --> 01:12:27.867]  I want to run out of the gates because I don't want to be a hypocrite.
[01:12:27.907 --> 01:12:29.188]  Let's talk about the Democrats.
[01:12:29.668 --> 01:12:35.451]  Chuckie Schumer is up there attacking Bush about this right now, but it was all over the news at the time that the intelligence was fake.
[01:12:35.911 --> 01:12:40.074]  Chuckie and Hillary and the rest of them, now grandstanding, they went along with this war.
[01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:47.337]  In some cases, such as Hillary, they're still supporting it and actually want to escalate it.
[01:12:47.457 --> 01:12:50.281]  So there's a whole range of views here.
[01:12:50.621 --> 01:12:59.853]  So how do we deal with this when we've got both parties... And see, I know this is a key to stopping this war, saving our troops, saving the Iraqi people, and cutting off this...
[01:13:00.453 --> 01:13:00.994]  We're good to go.
[01:13:22.032 --> 01:13:24.973]  When in reality, a lot of the so-called liberal icons are for it.
[01:13:25.333 --> 01:13:31.496]  So I say get past the whole partisan debate, and then that really knocks the steam out of the neocons.
[01:13:31.776 --> 01:13:40.999]  Yeah, that would be terrific if you could go to Hillary and say, look, your support for the war is turning the right-wingers against it because they hate you so much.
[01:13:41.819 --> 01:13:48.662]  But I think it's also important to keep pointing out to everyone that the vast majority of Americans oppose the war.
[01:13:49.481 --> 01:13:57.186]  And support for the war is a dwindling minority position regardless of what impression you might get from the so-called mainstream media.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.801]  So how long can this go on?
[01:14:02.661 --> 01:14:08.724]  If in six months of these numbers trend, we'll have 20% at current rates for the war.
[01:14:09.164 --> 01:14:14.426]  I guess we'll have 5% in 10 years for the war, because Cheney says we'll be there another decade at least.
[01:14:14.446 --> 01:14:15.187]  I mean, what are we going to do?
[01:14:15.907 --> 01:14:21.830]  Right, and then the question is, once we've got to 99% opposition to the war, will Congress act?
[01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:27.753]  There have been a few encouraging signs in that regard.
[01:14:27.953 --> 01:14:32.576]  There is a growing movement putting increasing pressure on Congress.
[01:14:32.596 --> 01:14:39.340]  There was a lot of discouragement when we had the biggest rallies ever on the planet and the war went right ahead.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:44.863]  Or when we put all our energy into an election that did us no good and the war went right ahead.
[01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:51.855]  But now there's a movement building again like it was before the war, and it's putting pressure on Congress.
[01:14:52.015 --> 01:15:04.604]  And we saw Harry Reid in the Senate two days ago more or less announce the existence of an opposition party in the Senate and demand that the Intelligence Committee do the investigation that it's been putting off for years.
[01:15:05.264 --> 01:15:11.809]  And today, Nancy Pelosi in the House, the Democratic leader, but for once actually leading Congress,
[01:15:12.287 --> 01:15:17.250]  But at a certain level, isn't this political grandstanding ahead of these elections that are coming up?
[01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:20.612]  Well, there aren't elections coming up right now.
[01:15:38.271 --> 01:15:41.733]  Really, really soon in most of the country, but there always are elections.
[01:15:41.833 --> 01:15:51.377]  No, I mean, they want to drag out some committee for the next six, eight months into the midterm elections, and then I think basically just put the whole thing to sleep later.
[01:15:51.677 --> 01:15:53.818]  I mean, why do we even need an investigation?
[01:15:54.078 --> 01:16:07.744]  We have Dick Cheney's own admissions that Saddam wasn't a threat in the... I'm not saying forget the Downing Street memo, but that is a smoking gun, but it's as big a smoking gun as the PNAC documents.
[01:16:09.272 --> 01:16:36.968]  Well, I agree with you that we have more smoking guns than we can count, that we have powerful evidence that they knowingly lied about the reasons for war, and the insulting claims that, oh, well, the war was really about this, and they throw out the latest idea is just nonsense when the president made a formal statement in a letter to Congress as required by law for why the war was necessary, and there were two reasons and only two reasons in it,
[01:16:37.697 --> 01:16:42.321]  One was the immediate threat from Iraq's weapons, and one was the ties to 9-11.
[01:16:42.862 --> 01:16:48.627]  Both of those were known at the time by the president to be false, and this is well documented.
[01:16:49.788 --> 01:17:04.021]  But if we are going to impeach these guys, if we are going to get anything of what you and I are talking about into the mouths of the talking heads on the cable shows and onto the pages of the New York Times,
[01:17:04.688 --> 01:17:06.890]  We are going to need Congress to act.
[01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.931]  No, I agree with you.
[01:17:07.951 --> 01:17:23.924]  I mean, I think an investigation into it will certainly even create more dislike and even lower approval ratings for the war, and then that'll be political capital to counter Bush's supposed political capital, another stolen election.
[01:17:23.964 --> 01:17:26.025]  But again, it's more than that.
[01:17:26.386 --> 01:17:28.027]  Kerry took a fall.
[01:17:28.287 --> 01:17:30.269]  Kerry laid down, when there was clear evidence...
[01:17:31.009 --> 01:17:32.770]  ...of vote fraud in Ohio.
[01:17:32.850 --> 01:17:35.232]  Kerry said he wanted to go into Syria.
[01:17:35.292 --> 01:17:37.293]  The war wasn't big enough for him.
[01:17:37.373 --> 01:17:55.705]  So I just really don't see the Democrats being legitimate in their attacks on Bush because it's like having another mafia Don go after his neighboring Don when the two were working together on the crime that the other mafia Don's going after him for now.
[01:17:57.023 --> 01:18:01.446]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you want somebody to defend the Democratic Party, it's not me.
[01:18:01.486 --> 01:18:03.307]  You know, I'm with you.
[01:18:03.807 --> 01:18:09.671]  But, again, they're starting to move a little bit in the direction of where people are.
[01:18:10.371 --> 01:18:11.352]  But not nearly enough.
[01:18:12.753 --> 01:18:16.675]  72% of Democrats want Bush impeached for lying about the war.
[01:18:17.296 --> 01:18:24.280]  And we have not a single Democratic candidate for Congress or incumbent in the House of Representatives.
[01:18:24.858 --> 01:18:27.420]  Or senator willing to push for impeachment.
[01:18:27.500 --> 01:18:31.884]  Well, they've had national polls where 50% of the American people want an impeachment.
[01:18:32.664 --> 01:18:32.865]  Right.
[01:18:32.905 --> 01:18:37.328]  That was a poll we commissioned, and 72% of Democrats in the same poll.
[01:18:37.608 --> 01:18:38.529]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[01:18:39.030 --> 01:18:39.470]  Stay there, sir.
[01:18:39.510 --> 01:18:40.731]  I really appreciate you joining us.
[01:18:41.171 --> 01:18:42.012]  We'll come right back.
[01:18:42.813 --> 01:18:48.477]  I just don't want people to think that we get rid of Bush, suddenly everything's happening.
[01:18:49.418 --> 01:18:50.299]  This is the big problem.
[01:18:50.319 --> 01:18:51.340]  We own both parties.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:51.800]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.775 --> 01:19:02.901]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[01:19:02.921 --> 01:19:07.544]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[01:19:07.884 --> 01:19:11.827]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[01:19:12.167 --> 01:19:17.190]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[01:19:17.610 --> 01:19:21.393]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like joint care,
[01:19:21.673 --> 01:19:22.293]  We're good to go.
[01:19:46.107 --> 01:19:46.408]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:19:53.994 --> 01:20:02.619]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:20:02.839 --> 01:20:14.106]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:20:14.326 --> 01:20:16.987]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:17.308 --> 01:20:21.410]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:20:23.932 --> 01:20:32.018]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:20:32.258 --> 01:20:37.943]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:20:38.263 --> 01:20:42.187]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:42.207 --> 01:20:42.908]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:42.928 --> 01:20:43.909]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:55.959 --> 01:20:57.020]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:21:02.904]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:03.484 --> 01:21:03.964]  That's right.
[01:21:04.284 --> 01:21:06.586]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:07.987 --> 01:21:14.071]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:14.611 --> 01:21:15.292]  We're good to go.
[01:21:33.945 --> 01:21:34.285]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:54.958 --> 01:21:58.261]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[01:21:58.602 --> 01:22:03.867]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[01:22:04.127 --> 01:22:06.009]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.
[01:22:06.329 --> 01:22:10.874]  Vitamir has created unique and natural patented formulas that set them apart from any other oral hygiene products.
[01:22:11.074 --> 01:22:17.460]  The folks at Vitamir have blended zinc, folic acid, myrrh, and clove oil into gentle but effective products that freshen your breath and fight gum disease.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:28.047]  Good health starts in your mouth, and regular use of Vitamir toothpaste and mouthwash is a powerful front line of defense against gingivitis, bleeding gums, and folks with braces or dentures will love that clean, fresh, just-from-the-dentist-office feeling.
[01:22:28.267 --> 01:22:31.609]  And once you've tried Vitamir, you just may find that no other toothpaste or mouthwash will do.
[01:22:31.869 --> 01:22:33.350]  Call 877-817-9829 at 677-817-9829 and order Vitamir mouthwash and toothpaste today.
[01:22:33.410 --> 01:22:35.251]  He'll be glad you did, and so will that special someone in your life.
[01:22:41.835 --> 01:22:46.256]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Vitamir oral hygiene products today.
[01:22:46.556 --> 01:22:50.117]  Try Vitamir and you'll feel that squeaky clean sensation others just talk about.
[01:22:50.137 --> 01:23:07.081]  Coming up, we'll tell you about Congress ramming through the law that something can be 75% genetically engineered or have
[01:23:08.659 --> 01:23:09.900]  Artificial ingredients in it?
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:11.001]  They'll call it organic.
[01:23:11.121 --> 01:23:12.281]  It's just amazing.
[01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:24.969]  But right now, we're talking to David Swanson, co-founder of the afterdowningstreet.org movement.
[01:23:26.691 --> 01:23:31.013]  And I guess, to boil it all down and not put it in some lengthy diatribe, it's this.
[01:23:32.414 --> 01:23:33.755]  It needs to be non-partisan.
[01:23:33.795 --> 01:23:35.256]  We need to go after Democrats.
[01:23:36.090 --> 01:23:40.012]  That pushed for this war and knew about fake intelligence and went along with it.
[01:23:41.173 --> 01:23:46.935]  And we need to make this non-partisan and we need to hang out a few Democrats to try as well and make examples of them.
[01:23:46.955 --> 01:23:52.318]  Because I guarantee you folks, Bill Clinton was for bombing Serbia based on total lies and total fraud.
[01:23:53.879 --> 01:23:55.720]  The neocons were advising him then.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.081]  And that's who runs this country.
[01:23:58.301 --> 01:24:00.722]  The neocons are just front men for these big corporate interests.
[01:24:01.565 --> 01:24:04.686]  And I hear Democrats on TV, I hear them on the radio, I read them in the newspaper.
[01:24:05.026 --> 01:24:06.646]  Oh, well, we need to keep our troops in Iraq.
[01:24:06.666 --> 01:24:10.487]  That's how we support them, by not letting the others die in vain.
[01:24:10.547 --> 01:24:12.267]  But we do need to punish Bush for lying.
[01:24:12.527 --> 01:24:14.307]  Now that we're there, we've got to stay.
[01:24:15.027 --> 01:24:15.308]  No!
[01:24:15.888 --> 01:24:16.168]  No!
[01:24:17.128 --> 01:24:18.608]  What do you say to that, David?
[01:24:20.108 --> 01:24:28.930]  Well, I think that we have to have Republicans on our side, and we have to take on Democrats when they don't stand up for what people want them to stand up for, which is most of the time.
[01:24:29.940 --> 01:24:57.821]  You know, there are a lot of Republicans in our coalition, and recovering Republicans, and former Republicans, and when Barbara Lee's resolution of inquiry into the Downing Street memos failed by one vote in the International Relations Committee on September 14th, one Republican voted for it, one voted present, that is, I abstain, and a couple of them stayed out of the room to be nice and not vote against it, and still we needed one more vote, so
[01:24:58.328 --> 01:25:05.443]  When Kucinich's resolution of inquiry into the White House-Iraq group comes up for a vote in a week and a half or so...
[01:25:05.973 --> 01:25:11.476]  We're hoping to have four or five Republicans with us and pass it and scare the hell out of them.
[01:25:11.496 --> 01:25:22.181]  But isn't it lying to Congress that Powell and Armitage and Rumsfeld went in there under oath and they lied over and over again about WMDs when they knew it was lies?
[01:25:22.541 --> 01:25:24.883]  Why don't we have U.S.
[01:25:24.943 --> 01:25:29.345]  attorneys or why don't we have federal or state grand juries indicting them for that?
[01:25:31.209 --> 01:25:39.717]  Because we don't control the Justice Department, because we have a Republican leadership in Congress controlling everything.
[01:25:41.092 --> 01:25:41.392]  You know what?
[01:25:41.432 --> 01:25:43.314]  I want to hear Democrats then call for indictments.
[01:25:43.354 --> 01:25:43.734]  And you're right.
[01:25:43.754 --> 01:25:49.699]  We got Gonzalez, the architect of the torture, saying Bush is literally a god creature above the law.
[01:25:49.719 --> 01:25:51.641]  His memos say, folks, that he is the law.
[01:25:51.661 --> 01:25:52.602]  The law flows from him.
[01:25:52.762 --> 01:25:53.843]  That's called dictatorship.
[01:25:54.063 --> 01:25:55.424]  So I guess we're just in deep trouble.
[01:25:55.865 --> 01:25:58.407]  And, I mean, now there's all this discussion of martial law.
[01:25:58.447 --> 01:25:59.448]  Bush wants to save us.
[01:25:59.528 --> 01:26:05.052]  And he's giving his cronies billions of dollars and Tamiflu and a bunch of his administrations making money off of it.
[01:26:05.233 --> 01:26:06.694]  I mean, this has got to stop, David.
[01:26:07.798 --> 01:26:08.759]  It's got to stop.
[01:26:08.819 --> 01:26:15.044]  There's been no more serious case for impeachment and removal from office than there is now.
[01:26:15.344 --> 01:26:15.544]  Ever?
[01:26:15.824 --> 01:26:16.004]  Ever?
[01:26:16.745 --> 01:26:17.305]  No, never.
[01:26:17.365 --> 01:26:24.250]  And there can be no more high crime than taking the nation to war on false pretenses.
[01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:26.572]  If you cannot impeach now, you never can.
[01:26:27.142 --> 01:26:28.923]  Or impeachment can only be about sex.
[01:26:29.103 --> 01:26:33.664]  Have you heard the neocons go to this new thing, David, where they say that, okay, it was a lie, so what?
[01:26:33.704 --> 01:26:34.244]  It's good.
[01:26:34.464 --> 01:26:35.545]  Let's attack more people.
[01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:36.425]  That's one thing they say.
[01:26:36.765 --> 01:26:39.386]  Or they say, we never said it was about WMDs.
[01:26:39.406 --> 01:26:40.286]  That's an urban legend.
[01:26:40.306 --> 01:26:41.447]  He would say that on Meet the Press.
[01:26:41.487 --> 01:26:42.127]  Rumsfeld did.
[01:26:42.667 --> 01:26:44.147]  And it was about freedom.
[01:26:44.207 --> 01:26:46.528]  It's a conspiracy to say we ever said WMDs.
[01:26:47.048 --> 01:26:48.549]  I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:26:48.789 --> 01:26:55.331]  Yeah, that's bizarre because, of course, we have print and video and radio documentation of Rumsfeld and Bush and...
[01:26:55.971 --> 01:27:04.498]  Powell and Rice and so on, making these statements as fact over and over again on the national media.
[01:27:04.918 --> 01:27:15.987]  Things that they had been told by the CIA were false, by the International Atomic Energy Agency, by the Energy Department, by the Czechs, by the Germans, by the Brits.
[01:27:16.334 --> 01:27:18.617]  They had been told that these claims were false.
[01:27:19.037 --> 01:27:20.139]  They knew they were lying.
[01:27:20.559 --> 01:27:24.404]  They went out and stated them as fact over and over again.
[01:27:24.424 --> 01:27:31.913]  Well, yeah, they claimed they were given bad intelligence, but it turns out they cooked that intelligence and then released it themselves out of the Vice President's office.
[01:27:32.603 --> 01:27:41.589]  That's right, and it's known that they did that, and it's known that they set up this group called the White House Iraq Group specifically to push phony propaganda.
[01:27:41.609 --> 01:27:44.951]  Well, let me say this at the close of this interview, and I really appreciate what your organization is doing.
[01:27:44.991 --> 01:27:52.576]  I think it is justice, and I have seen you criticizing the Democrats, and we need to get past partisanship and stop these wars, because the neocons aren't going to stop here.
[01:27:52.596 --> 01:27:53.537]  They want the whole world.
[01:27:53.897 --> 01:27:56.539]  But Ron Paul even said Bush may declare martial law.
[01:27:56.919 --> 01:27:58.380]  He may start confiscating guns.
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:00.321]  We may actually end up with a dictatorship.
[01:28:00.641 --> 01:28:01.382]  I think that's why he's
[01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:03.222]  I'm not kidding when I say this.
[01:28:03.543 --> 01:28:10.404]  Ray McGovern has said the same thing on my show, that the government may carry out terror attacks, David, and blame it on foreign enemies because they're that desperate.
[01:28:10.424 --> 01:28:10.945]  What do you say?
[01:28:12.105 --> 01:28:13.305]  I would not put it past them.
[01:28:13.585 --> 01:28:18.227]  I have not seen credible evidence that they did that on 9-11.
[01:28:18.387 --> 01:28:21.868]  Clearly, they were grossly negligent and irresponsible.
[01:28:22.188 --> 01:28:24.248]  But I certainly would not put it past them.
[01:28:24.508 --> 01:28:28.109]  They will do anything they can for greater power.
[01:28:28.609 --> 01:28:30.770]  Well, look at the Gulf of Tonkin info just came out.
[01:28:31.794 --> 01:28:36.118]  Yeah, let's hope we get the truth out in public on this one faster than 30 years.
[01:28:36.398 --> 01:28:37.859]  All right, thanks for joining us, David.
[01:28:37.979 --> 01:28:40.641]  After DowningStreet.org, we've got a link to an InfoWars.
[01:28:40.861 --> 01:28:41.542]  Take care, my friend.
[01:28:44.284 --> 01:28:45.205]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.685 --> 01:28:47.286]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.207 --> 01:28:50.869]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.835 --> 01:28:55.377]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:28:55.537 --> 01:28:56.679]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:28:56.859 --> 01:29:00.264]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:00.364 --> 01:29:00.784]  Phenol?
[01:29:01.105 --> 01:29:08.194]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:29:08.735 --> 01:29:12.639]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:29:12.739 --> 01:29:13.179]  Fragrance?
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:18.324]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:18.445 --> 01:29:23.149]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:29:23.369 --> 01:29:25.852]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[01:29:26.172 --> 01:29:29.574]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:29:29.734 --> 01:29:33.316]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:29:33.476 --> 01:29:35.838]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:29:36.018 --> 01:29:36.878]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:29:54.196 --> 01:30:00.437]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.577 --> 01:30:06.738]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:07.018 --> 01:30:15.440]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:22.701]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:23.021 --> 01:30:27.844]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:28.064 --> 01:30:33.468]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.808 --> 01:30:36.890]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:37.231 --> 01:30:45.196]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:53.982 --> 01:30:57.343]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:30:57.583 --> 01:30:57.923]  Why?
[01:30:57.943 --> 01:31:00.884]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:31:00.964 --> 01:31:05.905]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[01:32:03.993 --> 01:32:14.541]  I know we've got callers holding for the last hour, but I do have a guest with us right now and another guest coming up at the start of the next hour.
[01:32:15.221 --> 01:32:20.925]  I'll probably have time to make a few calls at the very end of this hour and then the last 30 minutes of the broadcast later.
[01:32:20.945 --> 01:32:28.591]  And I do want to get back into this new Supreme Court nominee, the latest fear-mongering with the bird flu.
[01:32:30.481 --> 01:32:43.109]  You know, our government says that we should accept martial law, and Bush wants $6 billion plus, almost $7 billion, to pay for the military to literally declare martial law, and for forced quarantines, forced inoculations.
[01:32:43.129 --> 01:32:46.271]  They're telling us now they'll restrict travel, lock down the cities.
[01:32:46.691 --> 01:32:48.032]  Everything we always knew.
[01:32:49.093 --> 01:32:52.215]  And I've said over and over again, at that point, you have to defend yourself.
[01:32:52.255 --> 01:32:53.956]  You have to take care of your family.
[01:32:55.232 --> 01:33:01.937]  In the first hour, I wasn't knocking people who will physically defend themselves and who will defend this nation.
[01:33:02.578 --> 01:33:17.491]  What I was talking about was some of the Republican Texas types, and that means some of the different groups, who just like to dress up in general outfits and run around playing secret agent and never get anything done.
[01:33:17.511 --> 01:33:22.255]  And then I get criticized for saying we can get a lot done peaceably.
[01:33:22.794 --> 01:33:24.696]  And we have been getting a lot done peaceably.
[01:33:26.057 --> 01:33:38.326]  The globalists are moving forward and they can't declare martial law, they can't run their takeover that Ron Paul has openly talked about on this show unless we go along with it, unless the police and military are conned into going along with it.
[01:33:38.767 --> 01:33:40.488]  And most of them aren't conned.
[01:33:40.808 --> 01:33:42.450]  Most of them are waking up right now.
[01:33:43.190 --> 01:33:45.312]  So I can't believe the criticism I get
[01:33:46.289 --> 01:33:57.199]  Much of it totally fabricated, but I guess one area that was contention that was based in some reality was saying that I don't want to just run around and start a shooting war.
[01:33:57.860 --> 01:34:02.384]  And I always, because that's what the globalists want, they want to go ahead and get a physical fight going on.
[01:34:02.404 --> 01:34:09.331]  I never get up, there's all these people on the air calling for violence, calling for physical war, and they never get in trouble because they're feds.
[01:34:10.391 --> 01:34:16.697]  And then other people hear that and they get mad at me because I won't call for going out and blasting judges.
[01:34:16.717 --> 01:34:19.980]  I mean, I've heard this routinely on the radio.
[01:34:20.040 --> 01:34:22.943]  That's total federal garbage.
[01:34:23.604 --> 01:34:24.945]  They want to radicalize us.
[01:34:24.985 --> 01:34:32.332]  They want to push us into that area so that they can then engage us because we're too effective right now with what we're doing peaceably.
[01:34:33.903 --> 01:34:37.105]  All right, my guest is holding, and I appreciate him coming on with us.
[01:34:37.125 --> 01:34:38.806]  We've had the director of the organization on.
[01:34:38.866 --> 01:34:56.498]  Now we have, I'm honored to have, Craig Manoa, Organic Consumer Association staff scientist, on how Congress has rammed through a sneak attack on organic standards despite massive consumer opposition and how the organic food standard has been ruined.
[01:34:56.798 --> 01:34:57.539]  And we have an article...
[01:34:58.542 --> 01:35:05.345]  That's right now up on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com by the Organic Consumers Association.
[01:35:05.385 --> 01:35:09.667]  Organic food standards ruined by Congress, and it gets into what happened.
[01:35:09.927 --> 01:35:16.170]  Congress rams through OTA sneak attack on organic standards despite massive consumer opposition.
[01:35:16.910 --> 01:35:20.332]  And for those that haven't paid attention to this, and I'm going to go to our guest here in a moment,
[01:35:22.967 --> 01:35:25.148]  It isn't just that organic food tastes better.
[01:35:25.529 --> 01:35:27.390]  It isn't just that it has more nutrition in it.
[01:35:27.490 --> 01:35:31.492]  It isn't just that it doesn't have chemical pesticides that eat your liver.
[01:35:33.654 --> 01:35:42.399]  It isn't just that cancer is up over 500% from the vaccines and the genetic engineering and the toxins and the things we eat and do and all the additives.
[01:35:43.319 --> 01:35:52.385]  It's that we've had top scientists, Nobel Prize winners on, scores of them over the years, people who work for big GM companies, genetically modified companies.
[01:35:53.627 --> 01:35:57.969]  When you change one gene, it always creates major problems.
[01:35:58.029 --> 01:35:59.710]  New enzymes, things you can't absorb.
[01:35:59.730 --> 01:36:01.912]  You know, all the baby rats die.
[01:36:02.592 --> 01:36:05.534]  All the rats on average live an average of a third as long.
[01:36:05.734 --> 01:36:07.875]  They get deformities in their intestine sizes.
[01:36:08.195 --> 01:36:09.256]  All sorts of health problems.
[01:36:09.676 --> 01:36:12.698]  Now we've done, there's been studies about all these new allergies in humans.
[01:36:13.158 --> 01:36:15.439]  People never had corn allergies and wheat allergies.
[01:36:15.459 --> 01:36:16.980]  It was unheard of 50 years ago.
[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:19.681]  Now it's massive in about, what, 10% of the population.
[01:36:19.941 --> 01:36:20.762]  I've got allergies.
[01:36:21.202 --> 01:36:23.343]  My grandmother is 80 years old.
[01:36:23.363 --> 01:36:24.543]  She's never had allergies in her life.
[01:36:24.763 --> 01:36:25.524]  She's got them now.
[01:36:25.864 --> 01:36:27.024]  Everybody I know has got them.
[01:36:28.205 --> 01:36:29.765]  And it's because of what's in the food.
[01:36:30.266 --> 01:36:33.647]  And then these are scientific, medical doctor, double-blind studies.
[01:36:34.487 --> 01:36:37.328]  This isn't just some little organization claiming they did a study.
[01:36:38.309 --> 01:36:40.029]  We know what this is doing.
[01:36:40.049 --> 01:36:42.090]  This is bad for our children, folks.
[01:36:42.130 --> 01:36:43.070]  This is poison.
[01:36:43.951 --> 01:36:49.373]  And so you've got this little seal that says that, you know, from the FDA, USDA,
[01:36:50.606 --> 01:36:51.977]  And now it doesn't matter.
[01:36:52.017 --> 01:36:52.885]  Now they can have...
[01:36:53.627 --> 01:36:53.847]  Okay.
[01:36:53.947 --> 01:36:55.107]  There's my little four-minute preface.
[01:37:23.534 --> 01:37:30.976]  And we are honored to be joined by Association staff scientist, Craig Manoa.
[01:37:31.036 --> 01:37:32.156]  Craig, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:37:32.216 --> 01:37:33.916]  Is what I said accurate, sir?
[01:37:35.497 --> 01:37:37.177]  That's pretty much hitting the nail on the head.
[01:37:38.157 --> 01:37:41.498]  Well, you're a scientist, I'm not, but I'm just going off what all the other scientists have told me.
[01:37:41.518 --> 01:37:42.378]  I mean, this is a crisis.
[01:37:44.299 --> 01:37:45.599]  Yeah, it's definitely a difficult...
[01:37:46.484 --> 01:37:54.408]  There's been a huge uproar within the organic industry and among organic consumers about this whole situation.
[01:37:56.249 --> 01:38:12.258]  When the initial rider was created and proposed to the Senate, within a matter of three days there was 250,000 letters sent by consumers to their senators opposing this rider.
[01:38:12.879 --> 01:38:18.424]  And immediately after that went straight into conference committee just because it was obviously such an issue of contention.
[01:38:18.444 --> 01:38:27.452]  Sat in that conference committee for about three weeks and most of the organic community wasn't
[01:38:29.097 --> 01:38:36.940]  Allowed to be a part of the process of discussing the text of that rider, whether it should be going, whether it shouldn't be going.
[01:38:37.440 --> 01:38:43.462]  The conference committee was being heavily lobbied by the creators of the rider itself.
[01:38:44.362 --> 01:38:53.185]  The creators of the rider were some of these big food companies like Kraft Foods, Dean Foods, which is the largest dairy distributor in the country.
[01:38:54.166 --> 01:38:55.426]  These were the businesses that
[01:38:56.107 --> 01:38:59.188]  Can really benefit by weakening the organic standards.
[01:39:00.028 --> 01:39:03.569]  Basically, though, the organic market is booming.
[01:39:04.049 --> 01:39:05.730]  There's a lot of money to be made there.
[01:39:06.370 --> 01:39:11.751]  And it's difficult, it's expensive to make a truly legitimate organic product.
[01:39:12.091 --> 01:39:13.932]  And that's why consumers paid more for it.
[01:39:14.392 --> 01:39:24.455]  And so these big food companies, by weakening the organic standards, they can create less expensive food products, sell it as organic, make a good profit off of it.
[01:39:26.573 --> 01:39:30.794]  In the meantime, the consumer assumes that they're really getting a legitimate organic product.
[01:39:33.155 --> 01:39:48.239]  Specifically, sir, tell us about your particular scientific discipline and then give us an overview for those that don't know why organics are important and what really truly sets the parameters.
[01:39:49.216 --> 01:39:51.820]  My background is in chemistry, biology and ecology.
[01:40:07.125 --> 01:40:11.607]  I've been working mostly with the nonprofit community for the better part of a decade.
[01:40:11.627 --> 01:40:19.690]  I also serve as an official advisor to the United Nations Environmental Program.
[01:40:20.830 --> 01:40:29.834]  As far as the benefit of organics, you're looking at an environmental positive impact.
[01:40:29.854 --> 01:40:34.496]  You're looking at positive health impacts, and you're looking at positive social economic impacts.
[01:40:35.143 --> 01:40:45.974]  The environmental aspect, you're not using synthetic fertilizers, you're not using synthetic pesticides, all of which are leaking into the soil and running off into the surface water.
[01:40:45.994 --> 01:40:52.081]  And the health impact, the pesticides that you're using on
[01:40:52.859 --> 01:40:53.379]  I think so.
[01:41:13.882 --> 01:41:14.663]  And that's all allowable.
[01:41:14.723 --> 01:41:17.487]  Imagine, folks, you're feeding your children pesticides.
[01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:32.264]  It's considered, well, it's at a small degree within those Cheerios.
[01:41:32.284 --> 01:41:35.665]  Well, it's because the government is lobbied by the very people making the Cheerios.
[01:41:36.025 --> 01:41:37.246]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:41:37.906 --> 01:41:47.810]  And when you think about eating those types of foods all day, every day, and the different types of chemicals, how those different types of chemicals are mixing within the different food products.
[01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:51.311]  Fifty years ago, it was rare that people had zits all over their face.
[01:41:51.351 --> 01:41:53.652]  Now, our kids all have zits all over the place.
[01:41:53.692 --> 01:41:57.914]  They've got human growth hormone in the milk, which is tied to, you know,
[01:41:59.069 --> 01:42:11.560]  Early development in sexual organs in males and females, the feminization of the male population, the females developing early, all sorts of studies, increases in cancers.
[01:42:12.041 --> 01:42:13.042]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:42:13.242 --> 01:42:20.048]  Just all of this is insane, and they don't even want us now to have the choice to be able to go in and see that it's certified organic.
[01:42:22.992 --> 01:42:23.632]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:42:24.953 --> 01:42:36.055]  The process of creating the USDA organic standards has really been an uphill battle the whole way just because we're constantly dealing with the heavy lobbying influences of big agribusiness.
[01:42:36.695 --> 01:42:38.236]  So industry is panicking, though.
[01:42:38.256 --> 01:42:42.497]  The big establishment industries with their big centralized mega agribusiness
[01:42:42.877 --> 01:42:45.418]  Because five years ago I couldn't find organic food.
[01:42:45.458 --> 01:42:51.619]  Now half the food at most stores at least claims it's organic because this is something that has really hit the mainstream.
[01:42:52.139 --> 01:42:55.740]  And obviously I'm in Austin, so more people are into organic food.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:56.760]  But I've been all over the country.
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:57.980]  It is exploding.
[01:42:58.180 --> 01:42:59.020]  They're panicking.
[01:42:59.461 --> 01:43:08.742]  And I've seen the lawsuits where they go after dairies that do say they don't have any hormones, artificial hormones, and, oh, you can't put that on your milk jug.
[01:43:08.802 --> 01:43:11.183]  I mean, again, I thought this was a free country.
[01:43:13.129 --> 01:43:30.592]  And a big part of the process that's currently taking place is these big companies that were initially opposing the organics or arguing against the side that supported organics are just simply stepping in and buying up these organic companies.
[01:43:31.352 --> 01:43:34.473]  Okay, so there's a consolidation.
[01:43:34.853 --> 01:43:37.753]  So we have this change now.
[01:43:37.813 --> 01:43:40.614]  Specifically, what is the change with this new law?
[01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:51.894]  Well, the new law, basically, well, there's three different tiers to it, but one of them is a commercial availability clause.
[01:43:52.915 --> 01:44:11.984]  Right now within the organic standards, there is a clause that says that if there's a certain type of ingredient that's agriculturally derived that you can't find on the market on an organic level or at a level that's actually affordable, then a company can
[01:44:13.684 --> 01:44:19.009]  So it's insane.
[01:44:19.329 --> 01:44:22.132]  It's insane.
[01:44:22.212 --> 01:44:26.777]  And of course then this will try to freeze out the growing organic market by people demanding it.
[01:44:26.817 --> 01:44:30.640]  It actually makes the market bigger and creates a lowering in prices and more availability.
[01:44:32.662 --> 01:44:32.982]  Right.
[01:44:33.183 --> 01:44:34.584]  Yeah, this will expand the
[01:44:35.487 --> 01:44:40.290]  Expand the list of ingredients that you can use in a multiple ingredient product that aren't organic.
[01:44:40.531 --> 01:44:41.771]  And I also read it here exactly.
[01:44:41.812 --> 01:44:43.373]  Artificial things now can be put in.
[01:44:44.413 --> 01:44:47.896]  Yeah, well, they already have been able to be in there.
[01:44:47.916 --> 01:44:53.740]  There's a specific list in the organic standards of synthetic ingredients that are allowed in organic products.
[01:44:53.820 --> 01:44:57.923]  And that list is very carefully... There's that key word, folks!
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:05.245]  You know, I've been sent emails that I'm a radical hippie because I believe cows should only eat grass, should only eat plants.
[01:45:05.505 --> 01:45:07.786]  It's not radical to say a cow shouldn't eat meat.
[01:45:07.886 --> 01:45:08.687]  They don't eat meat.
[01:45:08.867 --> 01:45:09.588]  They're not designed.
[01:45:09.628 --> 01:45:10.408]  They're herbivores.
[01:45:10.769 --> 01:45:16.813]  And then on top of it, they shouldn't eat their own species, which also happens to be rotten bovine product.
[01:45:17.073 --> 01:45:17.873]  That's interesting.
[01:45:17.933 --> 01:45:24.376]  We often times get people equating us with just being dirty hippies and not understanding what the whole organic market is about, what organic foods are.
[01:45:43.177 --> 01:45:47.299]  Really, quite simply, it's the way that our grandparents farmed.
[01:45:47.499 --> 01:45:48.220]  It's food.
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:49.360]  We want food.
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:52.942]  I don't want something with 500 ingredients that tastes like trash.
[01:45:53.422 --> 01:45:54.583]  And folks, you get used to this.
[01:45:54.683 --> 01:46:00.966]  Once you've been eating garbage, the weird taste, the chemically taste, the weird salty taste, you get used to that.
[01:46:01.146 --> 01:46:06.449]  When you start eating real food, folks, you go try to eat the heavily processed stuff, it tastes like chemicals.
[01:46:08.070 --> 01:46:08.910]  It stinks.
[01:46:09.411 --> 01:46:10.391]  And listen, listen.
[01:46:10.791 --> 01:46:11.692]  I'm somebody who's got...
[01:46:12.971 --> 01:46:13.772]  50 guns, folks.
[01:46:13.832 --> 01:46:15.013]  I'm somebody who goes hunting.
[01:46:15.273 --> 01:46:19.637]  I'm somebody who's pro-Second Amendment, get rid of the Federal Reserve.
[01:46:19.978 --> 01:46:23.721]  I'm not some hippie, and I don't want my kids eating deadly poison.
[01:46:23.741 --> 01:46:25.923]  I'm sorry to be ranting, sir.
[01:46:25.983 --> 01:46:27.585]  It just makes me so mad.
[01:46:28.526 --> 01:46:30.127]  Yeah, it is quite frustrating.
[01:46:30.187 --> 01:46:35.412]  One of the, I guess the silver lining of this is that
[01:46:36.355 --> 01:46:38.978]  It really did bring the organic community together.
[01:46:39.078 --> 01:46:41.139]  The organic community has grown so much.
[01:46:41.179 --> 01:46:43.902]  It's growing at 20% per year right now, just the market itself.
[01:46:44.262 --> 01:46:45.103]  That's exponential.
[01:46:45.923 --> 01:46:47.044]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:46:47.405 --> 01:46:56.513]  And as soon as this rider came out, most of the organic industry was opposed to it because most of the organic industry is made up of small family farmers and the like.
[01:46:56.813 --> 01:46:57.774]  But they had polls.
[01:46:58.154 --> 01:46:58.734]  They had polls.
[01:46:58.775 --> 01:46:59.915]  So were the American people.
[01:47:00.096 --> 01:47:02.758]  Congress is doing nothing now that is popular.
[01:47:03.678 --> 01:47:16.348]  Yeah, it was quite interesting because with 300,000, ultimately over 300,000 letters came into this conference committee that was meeting on it, and they were opposed to this rider.
[01:47:16.468 --> 01:47:28.297]  But this conference committee, which was made up predominantly of Republicans, was meeting behind closed doors and being, again, lobbied by the creators of this rider.
[01:47:28.838 --> 01:47:32.641]  And they ultimately met without the Democratic members there.
[01:47:33.368 --> 01:47:34.469]  Well, for those that don't know...
[01:47:55.552 --> 01:48:07.501]  I hear Limbaugh get on the air routinely, and I don't even listen very much, and say that it's all lies, George Washington Carver, genetically engineered crops, that a dog is genetically engineered.
[01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:09.743]  Yes, but you're a scientist, so I want you to comment on this.
[01:48:10.403 --> 01:48:12.785]  We've had geneticists on, folks, genetic engineers.
[01:48:13.706 --> 01:48:23.393]  You're taking the genetics the dog already had and manipulating those genetics, and that can still cause a lot of problems and all sorts of weird traits and illnesses the dog wouldn't have, genetic illnesses.
[01:48:24.048 --> 01:48:25.630]  Genetic traits there.
[01:48:26.631 --> 01:48:31.116]  George Washington Carver spliced subspecies and varieties of the same thing together.
[01:48:31.476 --> 01:48:33.358]  That naturally happens in the wild.
[01:48:33.859 --> 01:48:37.963]  No, no, we're talking about putting cockroach genes in tomatoes, salmon genes in corn.
[01:48:38.204 --> 01:48:42.288]  We're talking about stuff that creates toxins that our body cannot absorb.
[01:48:42.348 --> 01:48:42.929]  Is that accurate?
[01:48:44.870 --> 01:48:50.493]  Yeah, and we also don't know how these plants will mix within the natural environment.
[01:48:50.533 --> 01:48:59.497]  So, for example, there's a terminator gene, as they call it, which basically makes the plant not produce seed.
[01:48:59.777 --> 01:49:02.199]  This is beneficial for the companies that are selling this.
[01:49:02.239 --> 01:49:04.820]  And that can spread into species across the board and kill the life cycle.
[01:49:05.496 --> 01:49:05.896]  Exactly.
[01:49:06.897 --> 01:49:11.620]  We don't know how the spread of that pollen would affect the wildlife around it.
[01:49:11.660 --> 01:49:15.443]  But as you know, actually Terminator technology has jumped into other species.
[01:49:16.543 --> 01:49:21.887]  Yep, there has been a lot of studies that have shown that, but the Terminator gene has been...
[01:49:22.658 --> 01:49:28.220]  A huge issue of contention and just past the major hurdle, actually, internationally in the last couple of weeks here.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:30.101]  That looks like it is going to be approved here.
[01:49:30.601 --> 01:49:31.381]  See, there you go.
[01:49:31.421 --> 01:49:33.002]  Our precious UN's not saving us.
[01:49:33.022 --> 01:49:33.842]  They're going along with it.
[01:49:34.463 --> 01:49:35.103]  Sir, stay there.
[01:49:35.143 --> 01:49:36.904]  I know I've been running on here.
[01:49:37.384 --> 01:49:41.105]  One more segment, any key points you want to make, how we can stop this, how we can fight this.
[01:49:41.625 --> 01:49:45.927]  On the other side with our guests, we'll give you the website for this National Organic Association.
[01:49:46.307 --> 01:49:47.628]  It's so important, folks.
[01:49:47.648 --> 01:49:48.788]  This stuff is poison.
[01:49:49.248 --> 01:49:50.949]  It's not just not nutritious.
[01:49:55.106 --> 01:49:57.988]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.228 --> 01:49:58.929]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:59.029 --> 01:49:59.810]  Alex Jones here.
[01:50:00.150 --> 01:50:04.833]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:05.154 --> 01:50:11.879]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.219 --> 01:50:14.200]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.401 --> 01:50:17.263]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.343 --> 01:50:22.006]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.206 --> 01:50:26.629]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.869 --> 01:50:34.074]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.334 --> 01:50:36.756]  Discover the document of truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.916 --> 01:50:38.657]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:50:39.657 --> 01:50:44.800]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit Infowars.com and the secure shopping cart.

[01:50:54.122 --> 01:51:01.631]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:51:01.911 --> 01:51:12.824]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:51:12.944 --> 01:51:13.344]  We're good to go.
[01:51:29.574 --> 01:51:30.074]  That's right.
[01:51:30.254 --> 01:51:37.356]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:51:37.656 --> 01:51:46.399]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:46.439 --> 01:51:47.099]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:56.007 --> 01:52:01.949]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:02.189 --> 01:52:04.430]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:04.630 --> 01:52:10.972]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:11.312 --> 01:52:11.973]  We're good to go.
[01:52:31.547 --> 01:52:32.047]  We're good to go.
[01:52:32.067 --> 01:52:32.808]  We're good to go.
[01:52:56.937 --> 01:52:57.457]  Don't worry.
[01:52:57.898 --> 01:52:59.439]  This show is documented.
[01:52:59.939 --> 01:53:02.681]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.102 --> 01:53:06.664]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:53:07.045 --> 01:53:12.189]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:16.932]  I think what our friend who's online with us said really boils it down.
[01:53:17.072 --> 01:53:21.956]  You know, I babbled about it for a couple minutes, and he just condensed it down to its basic element.
[01:53:22.917 --> 01:53:36.008]  And we appreciate Craig Minella coming on, Organic Consumer Association staff scientist, on how Congress has rammed through a sneak attack where you won't even be able to really, in many areas, get organic food now if they have their way.
[01:53:36.849 --> 01:53:39.531]  And we'll tell you about their website before he leaves us here in just a few minutes.
[01:53:39.572 --> 01:53:40.793]  But all we want is food.
[01:53:41.533 --> 01:53:42.854]  Listen, I don't want chemicals.
[01:53:42.994 --> 01:53:45.937]  I don't want stuff produced in a laboratory.
[01:53:45.997 --> 01:53:47.358]  I don't want to eat crude oil.
[01:53:47.698 --> 01:53:49.300]  It's had its molecules changed around.
[01:53:50.265 --> 01:53:54.248]  It's the same thing with all these synthetic drugs the drug market pushes on us.
[01:53:54.308 --> 01:53:55.069]  It's toxic.
[01:53:56.029 --> 01:53:58.631]  And really, I don't even particularly care about myself too much.
[01:53:58.671 --> 01:53:59.572]  It's my children.
[01:54:00.893 --> 01:54:02.154]  And it's screwing us up.
[01:54:02.254 --> 01:54:03.355]  So many new health problems.
[01:54:03.395 --> 01:54:04.396]  So many new cancers.
[01:54:04.856 --> 01:54:05.977]  And it links back to this.
[01:54:08.899 --> 01:54:10.140]  Craig, how do we beat this?
[01:54:10.180 --> 01:54:11.141]  How do we stop this?
[01:54:11.161 --> 01:54:15.764]  I mean, I know the UN is about to let in the GM foods into Europe.
[01:54:15.804 --> 01:54:18.946]  I guess the only thing holding it back is the farmers threatening to riot.
[01:54:18.986 --> 01:54:19.547]  I mean, what do we do?
[01:54:22.142 --> 01:54:38.807]  Well, one of the positive things that's been happening is that there's a lot of good, solid science coming out right now that's proving over and over and over again that there is a serious situation going on with this overuse of synthetic fertilizers and synthetic pesticides.
[01:54:39.487 --> 01:54:47.769]  And it's taken a long time to grind that into the skulls of our policymakers, but the evidence is there, and the consumers know it.
[01:54:48.049 --> 01:54:51.470]  Because of that, you're seeing the organic market just explode.
[01:54:52.219 --> 01:54:52.459]  I think so.
[01:55:19.669 --> 01:55:37.814]  Well, the studies I've looked at, and I'm not poo-pooing that some of these fertilizers and pesticides are really bad, but at the same time, the evidence I've seen is I'm much more worried about these chimera cross-species creations.
[01:55:39.847 --> 01:55:44.169]  Yeah, there's been some interesting new species developed.
[01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:52.794]  One was a cross between a jellyfish and a potato where they took the gene out of the jellyfish for the potato.
[01:55:53.275 --> 01:56:00.139]  The goal was to create a potato that would start to glow if it started to get too dry so the farmer would know when it was time to water.
[01:56:00.439 --> 01:56:01.639]  Oh, sounds wonderful, yeah.
[01:56:03.140 --> 01:56:08.163]  These are the kind of developments that the genetic engineers are coming up with.
[01:56:08.203 --> 01:56:09.504]  Now, the science itself
[01:56:10.553 --> 01:56:27.324]  Maybe in another decade or so we would have a handle on it enough to start thinking about creating food from it, but it's a young enough science that we're just not in a spot to have our food production taken over so predominantly as it has.
[01:56:27.664 --> 01:56:30.606]  Well, where is this going from this point?
[01:56:30.646 --> 01:56:38.871]  I mean, how do we try to reverse this, or what are some of the seals that we can trust now that we can't trust the federal seals?
[01:56:39.722 --> 01:56:43.284]  Well, the USDA organic seal, you can still trust.
[01:56:43.644 --> 01:56:59.310]  This rider is going through, but the whole bureaucratic process of creating a product line, getting it certified, and creating your packaging and your labeling and everything like that, you're not going to see foods come onto the market with this.
[01:56:59.350 --> 01:57:03.832]  Yeah, that'll be a year or two, but I mean, what are these private seals I see?
[01:57:03.912 --> 01:57:04.973]  I see a lot of different seals.
[01:57:05.808 --> 01:57:09.771]  Yeah, the private seals, they're pretty difficult.
[01:57:11.372 --> 01:57:21.260]  The standards behind them are... There's so many details in any organic standard, it's so difficult to actually understand all the different levels of it.
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:25.883]  Okay, sir, please give us the website for the organization.
[01:57:25.903 --> 01:57:29.586]  It's www.organicconsumers.org.
[01:57:29.806 --> 01:57:30.787]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[01:57:33.715 --> 01:57:38.298]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:38.318 --> 01:57:38.838]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.878 --> 01:57:39.799]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.839 --> 01:57:43.081]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:45.002 --> 01:57:48.164]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.130 --> 01:57:57.030]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.050 --> 01:58:01.671]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.871 --> 01:58:09.012]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.913 --> 01:58:18.494]  Well, well, well, already into this third hour.
[01:58:19.875 --> 01:58:22.035]  We've got Thomas H. Naylor.
[01:58:24.295 --> 01:58:29.076]  Coming on in just about five minutes to talk about a move in Vermont to pull out of the union.
[01:58:29.096 --> 01:58:30.496]  This is going on in some other states.
[01:58:31.096 --> 01:58:36.157]  So we'll look at that for about 20 minutes, then I'll get back into some of the new martial law news concerning the bird flu.
[01:58:36.478 --> 01:58:37.838]  Bush is giving us more details.
[01:58:38.598 --> 01:58:40.638]  And the six plus billion bucks he wants to do it.
[01:58:40.678 --> 01:58:42.419]  I mean, the funding's going on right in front of us.
[01:58:43.479 --> 01:58:45.739]  And also this new pro-abortion conservative.
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:47.720]  I'm liberal because I'm against abortion.
[01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:50.020]  See, I'm beginning to learn how I'm an evil liberal.
[01:58:50.280 --> 01:58:53.301]  Evil, dirty, pro-gun, pro-border, anti-abortion conservative.
[01:58:53.988 --> 01:58:58.134]  Liberal, and this new guy, he's a good conservative because he's pro-abortion.
[01:58:58.935 --> 01:59:02.200]  Just like Roberts and the rest of his anti-gun crew up there.
[01:59:02.941 --> 01:59:06.065]  But let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Oregon.
[01:59:06.105 --> 01:59:07.527]  Mike, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:59:07.567 --> 01:59:08.008]  Welcome, sir.
[01:59:10.134 --> 01:59:18.737]  Thank you so much indeed for allowing me to talk and your show is number one and thank you so much again for the truth that you give us all.
[01:59:18.757 --> 01:59:20.117]  Well thank you for calling.
[01:59:20.477 --> 01:59:20.957]  Thank you sir.
[01:59:21.838 --> 01:59:23.138]  Two things I would like to talk.
[01:59:23.498 --> 01:59:29.700]  One thing that today in Ontario, Canada, actually the Muslims in Canada they want
[01:59:30.160 --> 01:59:32.742]  Is that where they march around beating themselves in the head with swords?
[01:59:47.951 --> 01:59:48.231]  Right.
[01:59:48.571 --> 01:59:49.992]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:59:50.153 --> 01:59:53.555]  And, you know, and now they are suing the government of Canada.
[01:59:53.816 --> 01:59:58.480]  I mean, this is the most ridiculous thing I have came up to.
[01:59:58.880 --> 02:00:09.589]  And another thing I would like to... Well, I would just say because of the sanitation and the danger, a bunch of people, thousands of people running around beating themselves in the heads with swords, bleeding everywhere.
[02:00:09.609 --> 02:00:12.652]  And, no, I have to, I mean...
[02:00:13.428 --> 02:00:15.569]  Look, if I've got a bunch of hate known for Muslims, so be it.
[02:00:15.609 --> 02:00:16.770]  Most Muslims are not into that.
[02:00:16.790 --> 02:00:21.673]  But there is a big sect that does like to run around beating themselves in the head with giant butcher knives.
[02:00:22.294 --> 02:00:23.034]  They're Shia.
[02:00:23.514 --> 02:00:24.455]  They're Shia.
[02:00:24.715 --> 02:00:25.856]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[02:00:25.916 --> 02:00:35.542]  I'm not assuming the government of Canada for millions of dollars or they need to give them the right to bring a Taliban government, a Talibanic nature into Ontario, Canada.
[02:00:35.882 --> 02:00:37.763]  And that's not good.
[02:00:38.504 --> 02:00:40.245]  And another thing... Wait a minute.
[02:00:40.345 --> 02:00:41.586]  The Taliban aren't Shia.
[02:00:42.358 --> 02:00:45.120]  Yes, but they're Sunni or Wahhabis.
[02:00:45.360 --> 02:00:54.147]  Yeah, well, the Shia believe that you can only have prophets and leaders who are from direct lines of Muhammad, and then the others don't, you know.
[02:00:54.307 --> 02:00:54.667]  Exactly.
[02:00:54.687 --> 02:00:56.749]  The Shia are the smallest sect of Muslims.
[02:00:57.129 --> 02:01:00.371]  Yes, yes, and they're barbaric, too, like them.
[02:01:00.452 --> 02:01:04.795]  I mean, most of them, I mean, the rules and regulations are barbaric in nature.
[02:01:05.175 --> 02:01:11.680]  I mean, Canada is a free country, but... I'm just curious, what is your national origin derivation?
[02:01:13.121 --> 02:01:17.223]  I'm Iranian-American, yes, but I don't believe on that.
[02:01:17.544 --> 02:01:20.645]  Are you a Persian Christian?
[02:01:21.125 --> 02:01:23.166]  Yes, yes, yes.
[02:01:24.367 --> 02:01:33.051]  And I told them I'm a terrorist, number one, and they need to move from Iran as soon as possible.
[02:01:33.715 --> 02:01:34.015]  Also.
[02:01:34.135 --> 02:01:35.215]  But let me just ask you a question.
[02:01:35.255 --> 02:01:41.537]  Who do you... I mean, certainly, our governments are importing radical Islam to try to create a problem.
[02:01:41.557 --> 02:01:45.899]  It's just like they fund the white supremacists, they fund the black supremacists, they fund the Mecha people.
[02:01:46.259 --> 02:01:49.460]  You know, they put this black doctor on C-Spanish and kill all the whites.
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:52.861]  I mean, they want us at each other's throats, but let me just ask you a question.
[02:01:52.901 --> 02:01:53.341]  I'm curious.
[02:01:53.561 --> 02:01:54.901]  Who do you think is behind 9-11?
[02:01:56.582 --> 02:02:01.223]  That one is, you know, we listen to you all the time.
[02:02:09.506 --> 02:02:10.386]  Well, it certainly is.
[02:02:10.446 --> 02:02:16.070]  I mean, listen, I do believe radical Islam is a serious threat, and I'm a Christian myself, you know, we're brothers in that.
[02:02:16.510 --> 02:02:17.431]  But at the same time...
[02:02:18.872 --> 02:02:21.534]  I think the threat of it is way, way overrated.
[02:02:21.554 --> 02:02:24.315]  But yes, I don't think, that's not free speech.
[02:02:24.415 --> 02:02:26.897]  Running around, splattering blood everywhere.
[02:02:26.917 --> 02:02:28.058]  Exactly.
[02:02:28.238 --> 02:02:29.098]  Should not be going on.
[02:02:29.118 --> 02:02:29.919]  I appreciate your call.
[02:02:30.059 --> 02:02:30.959]  Thank you, sir.
[02:02:30.979 --> 02:02:31.320]  You bet.
[02:02:31.860 --> 02:02:33.301]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:33.741 --> 02:02:38.184]  Yeah, I mean, they'll arrest you in Philadelphia for praying, but you can run around beating yourself in the head with a machete.
[02:02:38.924 --> 02:02:40.105]  It's just, it's out of control.
[02:02:45.234 --> 02:02:52.079]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:52.379 --> 02:02:53.780]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:53.961 --> 02:02:56.162]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.322 --> 02:02:58.404]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:58.684 --> 02:03:03.628]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:03.948 --> 02:03:07.991]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:03:08.231 --> 02:03:10.012]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:03:10.072 --> 02:03:20.740]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:22.781]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:03:23.001 --> 02:03:26.864]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the Infowars.
[02:03:26.944 --> 02:03:28.365]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[02:03:28.385 --> 02:03:28.605]  That's 888-2533-139.
[02:03:35.731 --> 02:03:36.692]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.962 --> 02:03:50.445]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:50.805 --> 02:03:54.888]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.729]  We listened.
[02:03:56.049 --> 02:04:01.013]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.293 --> 02:04:01.773]  We listened.
[02:04:02.173 --> 02:04:05.216]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:05.636 --> 02:04:06.156]  We listened.
[02:04:06.637 --> 02:04:10.159]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power.
[02:04:10.179 --> 02:04:10.659]  We're good.
[02:04:36.046 --> 02:04:37.490]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:38.674]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:47.032 --> 02:04:48.513]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[02:04:48.693 --> 02:04:52.615]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[02:04:52.895 --> 02:05:00.220]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste fill is something we all face every day.
[02:05:00.500 --> 02:05:02.421]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[02:05:02.721 --> 02:05:09.485]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[02:05:09.825 --> 02:05:12.687]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[02:05:12.967 --> 02:05:18.430]  Your nuke alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.
[02:05:18.691 --> 02:05:19.591]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:20.892 --> 02:05:25.615]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your nuke alert today.
[02:05:25.895 --> 02:05:29.117]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[02:05:29.477 --> 02:05:33.980]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:34.480]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:37.262 --> 02:05:41.223]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nuke Alert today.
[02:05:41.383 --> 02:05:41.823]  Nuke Alert.
[02:05:42.104 --> 02:05:43.184]  Isn't your family worth it?
[02:05:46.425 --> 02:05:52.447]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.067 --> 02:05:56.048]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:11.644 --> 02:06:13.185]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:06:13.665 --> 02:06:17.947]  Now eight minutes, thirty seconds into this third hour today.
[02:06:18.708 --> 02:06:23.250]  And coming up later, we'll be taking some of your calls and getting back into some of the news we have not detailed yet.
[02:06:24.351 --> 02:06:27.452]  But right now, we're joined by Thomas H. Naylor.
[02:06:27.472 --> 02:06:28.453]  We're going to him in a second.
[02:06:28.533 --> 02:06:30.654]  Founder of the Second Vermont Republic.
[02:06:31.286 --> 02:06:44.514]  Which is pushing a resolution that the state of Vermont peaceably and democratically free itself from the United States of America and return to its natural status as an independent republic as it was between January 15, 1777 and March 4, 1791, or 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 years.
[02:06:44.554 --> 02:06:47.375]  Before we go to our guest, just some background.
[02:06:47.415 --> 02:06:49.076]  Four and a half years ago,
[02:06:55.951 --> 02:07:02.795]  I had a prominent state rep on from Arizona who was moving to pull out of the union if martial law or gun confiscation began.
[02:07:02.855 --> 02:07:09.479]  Now martial law is being set up publicly and gun confiscation has begun all over the country in different areas from different guises, especially New Orleans.
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:11.961]  Ron Paul talked about that here on air a few weeks ago.
[02:07:12.441 --> 02:07:13.161]  We had New Hampshire.
[02:07:13.201 --> 02:07:13.961]  It was to vote on September 20th.
[02:07:35.399 --> 02:07:35.940]  We're good to go.
[02:07:36.000 --> 02:07:36.200]  I think?
[02:07:58.067 --> 02:08:03.994]  Instead of people that wanted to be just mainstream about it and take the country back, that's how you can do this.
[02:08:04.474 --> 02:08:12.283]  We have had callers call in, though, that are saying, we heard it last hour, well-meaning guy against genetically engineered foods, wanting us to be able to have choices.
[02:08:12.644 --> 02:08:16.988]  He called it sustainability, but then he had to admit the UN is going along with all this.
[02:08:17.028 --> 02:08:18.290]  Well, it's all about the same people.
[02:08:19.022 --> 02:08:28.934]  We had callers, a caller, and I've even got some emails and faxes coming in, going, well, this Thomas H. Naylor guy, he's for all the sustainability stuff, and when you hear the word sustainability, folks, that means serfdom, feudalism.
[02:08:29.255 --> 02:08:30.616]  The big corporations are pushing it.
[02:08:31.197 --> 02:08:34.621]  Obviously, I would be for real sustainability, but...
[02:08:36.372 --> 02:08:37.714]  Oh, greetings, Alex.
[02:08:37.754 --> 02:08:38.014]  You bet.
[02:08:38.034 --> 02:08:38.194]  Are you...
[02:08:50.842 --> 02:08:57.225]  The Agenda 21 change agent seizing upon Vermont to be a UN fiefdom?
[02:08:57.665 --> 02:08:59.406]  Oh, I don't even know what Agenda 21 is.
[02:08:59.446 --> 02:09:01.346]  You have to tell me what that is.
[02:09:01.867 --> 02:09:07.829]  Well, you know, the global corporations control the IMF, the World Bank, the World Health Organization, the UN, our government.
[02:09:08.489 --> 02:09:09.309]  We're good to go.
[02:09:09.329 --> 02:09:09.570]  I think?
[02:09:29.437 --> 02:09:42.241]  Your reference to sustainability, sustainability in Vermont means small towns, small villages, small businesses, small farms, small schools, you know, back to the land, sense of community.
[02:09:42.461 --> 02:09:46.143]  Yeah, you're saying Walmart's killing our communities, and I agree with you there.
[02:09:46.343 --> 02:09:46.743]  Oh, yeah.
[02:09:46.763 --> 02:09:52.365]  I mean, Walmart is the antithesis of community, of sustainability.
[02:09:52.745 --> 02:09:55.726]  Yeah, I think what's happening is a lot of good conservative people now
[02:09:56.846 --> 02:09:57.307]  We're good to go.
[02:10:15.596 --> 02:10:16.517]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:10:16.537 --> 02:10:16.797]  Absolutely.
[02:10:42.293 --> 02:10:48.440]  Well, basically there are two ideas underlying the Second Vermont Republic.
[02:10:49.461 --> 02:10:56.608]  We're concerned first and foremost about the loss of moral authority of the United States government.
[02:10:56.968 --> 02:10:59.271]  We think it's corrupt to the core.
[02:11:00.132 --> 02:11:01.093]  It has no soul.
[02:11:01.653 --> 02:11:04.917]  And second of all, the entire country, the United States of America,
[02:11:06.003 --> 02:11:10.285]  We feel is unsustainable, ungovernable, and unfixable.
[02:11:10.325 --> 02:11:17.427]  And when I say unsustainable, I mean economically, politically, socially, morally, environmentally, militarily.
[02:11:17.467 --> 02:11:22.549]  Now, by using that buzzword that people misunderstood, you mean there's a giant hole in the bottom of the ship.
[02:11:22.609 --> 02:11:23.249]  It's going down.
[02:11:23.829 --> 02:11:26.210]  Yeah, so the question is, do you go down?
[02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:28.090]  The empire is going down.
[02:11:28.110 --> 02:11:29.891]  Do you want to go down with the Titanic?
[02:11:30.311 --> 02:11:33.956]  Do you want to consider other options while there are still options on the table?
[02:11:34.416 --> 02:11:42.286]  The one that we are trying to educate people to make them more aware of is that secession, contrary to what Lincoln told us 150 years ago,
[02:11:44.322 --> 02:11:48.226]  It is legal, it's constitutionally, and it's economically viable.
[02:11:48.246 --> 02:11:51.550]  Well, the Declaration of Independence starts out with that.
[02:11:51.810 --> 02:11:52.391]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:11:52.431 --> 02:11:55.554]  It's our right, it's our duty to secede.
[02:11:55.614 --> 02:12:01.640]  It's in the state constitutions of all but four western states that are really still just federal holdings.
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.521]  I mean, we're not slaves.
[02:12:03.561 --> 02:12:05.862]  We don't have to stay part of the District of Columbia.
[02:12:05.882 --> 02:12:06.763]  It's our job.
[02:12:07.243 --> 02:12:13.987]  I want states to secede, then have a new Continental Congress, and then reform a union if the states so choose.
[02:12:14.007 --> 02:12:22.452]  And I believe by joining together, we do get something good, but we have to first take it back from the feds who've gotten arrogant, who've gotten away with this for so long.
[02:12:22.692 --> 02:12:25.874]  And folks, I've seen this so many times in businesses and companies and government.
[02:12:26.134 --> 02:12:27.755]  You get these arrogant people who think they can...
[02:12:28.235 --> 02:12:31.378]  The sky's the limit, and pride goes before a fall, folks.
[02:12:31.398 --> 02:12:32.499]  That's right when they fall.
[02:12:32.819 --> 02:12:34.440]  We really have a chance to do this.
[02:12:34.500 --> 02:12:37.843]  I mean, were you aware New Hampshire almost did it back in 2001?
[02:12:37.983 --> 02:12:40.385]  I was not so aware of that.
[02:12:40.525 --> 02:12:51.855]  More recently, you know, there's something called the New Hampshire Free State Project, where a group of people moved in, and they actually want to take over the government of New Hampshire and set up a kind of...
[02:12:52.845 --> 02:12:54.407]  Of libertarian state.
[02:12:54.427 --> 02:12:56.289]  It's a bit different from what we have in mind.
[02:12:58.232 --> 02:12:59.293]  Tell us what you've got in mind.
[02:12:59.313 --> 02:12:59.573]  Tell us.
[02:12:59.814 --> 02:13:11.908]  Well, I mean, first and foremost, our objective is, like you said in your introductory remarks, is we want to return Vermont to its status as an independent republic as it was back...
[02:13:12.669 --> 02:13:12.909]  Exactly.
[02:13:13.009 --> 02:13:13.289]  Exactly.
[02:13:13.309 --> 02:13:13.449]  Okay.
[02:13:41.792 --> 02:13:42.413]  Please continue.
[02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:48.560]  So anyway, objective one is that we want to split, we want to leave the Union.
[02:13:48.580 --> 02:13:56.009]  And then objective two is we actually favor the peaceful disillusionment of the Empire.
[02:13:56.536 --> 02:14:07.521]  We realize that if there are quite a few other states out there doing the same thing, which there are, there are about 25 states that have independence movements at the present time.
[02:14:07.541 --> 02:14:09.562]  So does Canada, and it's very powerful.
[02:14:09.582 --> 02:14:11.383]  It's a majority in some western areas.
[02:14:11.843 --> 02:14:12.043]  Right.
[02:14:12.084 --> 02:14:20.948]  As a matter of fact, the separatist movement in Quebec is now soaring as a result of the big scandal with the Liberal Party that was just...
[02:14:22.057 --> 02:14:29.219]  The report just came out night before last, and so the separatists are flying high once again in Quebec.
[02:14:29.520 --> 02:14:30.620]  But that's how we want it.
[02:14:30.660 --> 02:14:32.761]  I mean, folks, we want three states to run to.
[02:14:32.801 --> 02:14:34.561]  We want every county being different.
[02:14:34.601 --> 02:14:38.082]  We want separation of powers, but the government acts like that's bad.
[02:14:39.483 --> 02:14:47.286]  Yeah, I mean, secession is one of the few terms in which liberals and conservatives in this country can agree on.
[02:14:47.326 --> 02:14:51.347]  They both view it as anathema that it's really bad because Lincoln...
[02:14:52.149 --> 02:15:01.775]  Well, the problem is that with people who call themselves conservatives in the United States, who would tend to favor decentralization,
[02:15:03.286 --> 02:15:14.229]  Most American conservatives are such nationalists, like Ronald Reagan and George Bush, that their nationalism always trumps their tendency towards decentralization.
[02:15:14.249 --> 02:15:15.070]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:15:15.150 --> 02:15:15.970]  America's gone.
[02:15:16.090 --> 02:15:17.810]  Let's stop playing games.
[02:15:17.890 --> 02:15:19.331]  Let's stop joking about this.
[02:15:19.611 --> 02:15:29.334]  We have been, and they even brag, we have been totally seized by international corporations using us as their slaves as an engine for corrupt world empires.
[02:15:29.935 --> 02:15:31.777]  Right on the money.
[02:15:31.817 --> 02:15:33.660]  That is exactly our point of view.
[02:15:34.681 --> 02:15:36.724]  That's precisely where we are.
[02:15:36.764 --> 02:15:38.526]  Well, it's not even our point of view.
[02:15:38.566 --> 02:15:39.388]  That's the facts.
[02:15:39.448 --> 02:15:40.149]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:15:40.209 --> 02:15:41.631]  I agree.
[02:15:42.879 --> 02:15:46.561]  So I want to see states break up.
[02:15:47.061 --> 02:15:49.463]  I want to see it happen two later.
[02:15:50.163 --> 02:15:50.903]  I love America.
[02:15:50.943 --> 02:15:51.684]  I'm a nationalist.
[02:15:51.744 --> 02:15:52.624]  Reconstitute it.
[02:15:53.345 --> 02:15:57.347]  But the corporations are already getting rid of our borders.
[02:15:57.567 --> 02:16:01.109]  They're already merging America into their big global empire.
[02:16:01.129 --> 02:16:02.950]  See, they're going in the opposite direction.
[02:16:02.990 --> 02:16:04.070]  We need to fragment.
[02:16:04.371 --> 02:16:04.971]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:05.451 --> 02:16:10.394]  Well, you know, I was talking about that liberals and conservatives both are opposed to secession.
[02:16:10.954 --> 02:16:26.383]  Maybe to comment on the liberal side of the equation, the problem with liberals, and we have a big problem with them in Vermont because about 60% of the people voted against Bush and they call themselves progressives and they support Congressman Bernie Sanders.
[02:16:27.103 --> 02:16:33.447]  And the progressives, in their heart of hearts, know that the only way to solve all of our problems is
[02:16:33.803 --> 02:16:35.204]  Because they're owned by the exact same people.
[02:16:35.504 --> 02:16:36.204]  And liberals don't get it.
[02:16:36.224 --> 02:16:37.485]  No, they absolutely don't get it.
[02:16:37.505 --> 02:16:37.965]  They both...
[02:16:58.255 --> 02:17:05.116]  They vote for big government all day long, and all they're doing is giving corporations a bigger straw to suck our wealth out of us.
[02:17:05.156 --> 02:17:12.618]  Yeah, I went to a fundraiser for Congressman Bernie Sanders a few weeks ago, and he's railing against the corruption in the U.S.
[02:17:12.698 --> 02:17:13.798]  Senate.
[02:17:13.858 --> 02:17:15.459]  I mean, this is his style.
[02:17:15.939 --> 02:17:19.159]  And after the speech, I said, Congressman, I agree that the U.S.
[02:17:19.199 --> 02:17:24.280]  Senate is corrupt to the core, but why are you running for the United States Senate?
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:25.921]  Why do you want to be a member of it?
[02:17:26.201 --> 02:17:27.681]  And, you know, he didn't get it.
[02:17:29.575 --> 02:17:29.956]  Stay there.
[02:17:29.996 --> 02:17:31.276]  This is an amazing interview, sir.
[02:17:31.317 --> 02:17:33.378]  I want to take some calls if it's okay with you a little bit later.
[02:17:33.998 --> 02:17:35.059]  This is so important.
[02:17:35.099 --> 02:17:37.681]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:17:38.181 --> 02:17:41.103]  We'll give out your organization's website as well.
[02:17:41.524 --> 02:17:41.924]  I'm ready.
[02:17:41.964 --> 02:17:43.165]  I'm ready for Texas to see.
[02:17:43.505 --> 02:17:44.326]  I want it to happen.
[02:17:45.402 --> 02:17:46.182]  Attention drivers.
[02:17:46.503 --> 02:17:49.044]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[02:17:49.344 --> 02:17:52.646]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[02:17:52.966 --> 02:17:57.828]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents in fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[02:17:58.188 --> 02:18:01.850]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[02:18:02.290 --> 02:18:03.331]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[02:18:03.631 --> 02:18:06.632]  Poor mileage and reduced performance in a time of record fuel prices.
[02:18:06.953 --> 02:18:07.593]  There is an answer.
[02:18:07.873 --> 02:18:13.996]  Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.
[02:18:14.256 --> 02:18:21.320]  Plus, a special mileage improver designed and fleet tested by a major oil company to improve mileage even on new cars by up to 4%.
[02:18:21.660 --> 02:18:23.902]  The mileage improvement lasts for an entire oil change.
[02:18:24.182 --> 02:18:28.144]  So quit wasting unburned fuel and get more when you treat your car right with Protecta.

[02:18:39.433 --> 02:18:41.134]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[02:18:41.154 --> 02:18:41.914]  One and the same.
[02:18:54.907 --> 02:18:58.868]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:58.888 --> 02:19:00.949]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:00.969 --> 02:19:01.469]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:19:01.509 --> 02:19:02.970]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:03.290 --> 02:19:03.770]  Here is reality.
[02:19:03.790 --> 02:19:05.811]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:20.632 --> 02:19:20.872]  That's 1-800-686-2237

[02:20:46.445 --> 02:20:49.908]  Government is best which governs the... Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:20:50.348 --> 02:20:53.050]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:20:53.491 --> 02:20:56.153]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:20:56.593 --> 02:21:03.058]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:21:23.890 --> 02:21:25.310]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:21:25.510 --> 02:21:25.850]  Have you?
[02:21:26.430 --> 02:21:27.951]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:21:28.391 --> 02:21:29.892]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[02:21:29.952 --> 02:21:31.472]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:21:36.587 --> 02:21:41.011]  If you read the Declaration of Independence, Bill of Rights, Constitution, the Constitutional Debates...
[02:22:01.045 --> 02:22:02.686]  All we are is an alliance.
[02:22:02.746 --> 02:22:04.988]  We're a group of countries together.
[02:22:05.068 --> 02:22:06.529]  You know, the United States.
[02:22:07.309 --> 02:22:09.730]  A state is a state of state powers.
[02:22:10.011 --> 02:22:10.971]  England is a state.
[02:22:12.372 --> 02:22:13.573]  A state just means a government.
[02:22:14.553 --> 02:22:15.154]  And a people.
[02:22:16.375 --> 02:22:28.162]  And so, we've gone so far in the other direction, we've got the secede, and then obviously there'll be agreements between our states and the neighboring state, and with whatever central government's left.
[02:22:28.675 --> 02:22:33.439]  But we need to go into Washington, and I mean tear down the National Monument, tear down the Capitol, and you're on.
[02:22:33.459 --> 02:22:34.119]  What do you mean tear?
[02:22:34.199 --> 02:22:36.321]  It's all treasonous evil, folks.
[02:22:37.082 --> 02:22:42.546]  It's a giant Masonic devil base, basically, and it has nothing to do with what this country's about.
[02:22:43.127 --> 02:22:45.889]  And we've got to talk in those type of extremes.
[02:22:47.377 --> 02:22:49.178]  Because that's the only way we're going to change anything.
[02:22:49.218 --> 02:22:52.340]  I mean, the federal government controlled by these private interests isn't going to stop.
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:59.446]  They want to have forced drugging just because the drug companies lobby and want to force us to take their products of every school-aged child in the country.
[02:22:59.486 --> 02:23:00.146]  That's new freedom.
[02:23:00.346 --> 02:23:08.152]  They're going to give us national ID cards and track everything we do and put toll roads on all the major roads and sell off the rights to the royal family of Spain.
[02:23:08.212 --> 02:23:09.153]  I mean, that's in Texas.
[02:23:09.653 --> 02:23:10.754]  I mean, there's no end to it.
[02:23:10.774 --> 02:23:14.417]  We're literally being bought and sold like slaves by this federal government.
[02:23:14.517 --> 02:23:15.958]  It's a criminal organization.
[02:23:16.578 --> 02:23:21.720]  We're going to take some calls coming up in the next segment for our guests at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:23:21.780 --> 02:23:23.921]  Ruben, Elias, and many others that are holding.
[02:23:23.961 --> 02:23:26.022]  But going back to Thomas H. Naylor.
[02:23:26.822 --> 02:23:28.523]  Thomas, how are you guys going about this?
[02:23:28.563 --> 02:23:30.964]  Because we know secession is popular.
[02:23:31.544 --> 02:23:34.466]  We know that people are angry and are upset.
[02:23:34.946 --> 02:23:37.447]  And I think this is a move that needs to start nationwide.
[02:23:37.507 --> 02:23:42.269]  This will finally get the attention of the parasites in Washington.
[02:23:43.076 --> 02:23:46.159]  We took a very big step forward last Friday, Alex.
[02:23:46.199 --> 02:23:57.288]  We had the first statewide convention on secession since May 20, 1861, when North Carolina voted to secede and join the Confederacy back at that time.
[02:23:57.849 --> 02:24:01.532]  We had over 300 people come to our convention.
[02:24:02.733 --> 02:24:04.454]  It was really a smashing success.
[02:24:04.554 --> 02:24:10.920]  It attracted a huge amount of media attention, both in Vermont and outside of the state.
[02:24:11.727 --> 02:24:21.658]  It was very invigorating, and just the symbolism of holding this meeting in the House chambers of the State House.
[02:24:22.659 --> 02:24:23.660]  People got the message.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:25.021]  It was very powerful.
[02:24:27.584 --> 02:24:29.786]  I tell you, this has been started a few other times.
[02:24:29.846 --> 02:24:33.330]  Before the Free State Project even existed, it almost happened in New Hampshire.
[02:24:34.039 --> 02:24:34.580]  I don't know.
[02:24:58.619 --> 02:25:00.580]  Our founding fathers didn't do it that way.
[02:25:00.920 --> 02:25:11.584]  They set up a Congress with the elected individuals and leaders from the colonies, and then it wasn't until a year into the war that they even declared independence and that it was going to be a new nation.
[02:25:11.644 --> 02:25:14.765]  Yeah, well, that's kind of where we're headed.
[02:25:14.825 --> 02:25:24.049]  What we need is to convince the legislature to call a statewide convention to consider one and only one issue, namely articles of secession.
[02:25:24.861 --> 02:25:39.318]  And we probably need to pass that by about a two-thirds vote, then take that result to Washington, to embassies around the world, you know, seeking recognition both by Washington, the other states, as well as...
[02:25:41.506 --> 02:25:44.148]  Well, there also needs to be a Declaration of Independence.
[02:25:44.228 --> 02:25:49.433]  I mean, you need to go around and get the legislators to sign on, those that won't.
[02:25:49.453 --> 02:25:55.338]  Yeah, and it was very gratifying that we actually had several legislators showed up at the convention.
[02:25:55.358 --> 02:26:03.985]  You know, even though it's not an official convention, but they were there, and a major gubernatorial candidate was there as well.
[02:26:04.265 --> 02:26:05.406]  It was quite gratifying.
[02:26:06.385 --> 02:26:09.949]  Well, the program, though, can be systematically carried out.
[02:26:09.989 --> 02:26:30.729]  I mean, you just simply go in, poll the legislature, bring forward your grievances, bring forward your Declaration of Independence, what the king has done, what Washington has done, the powers and the legal investitures that are within the state constitution, as well as the federal constitution and Declaration of Independence.
[02:26:32.790 --> 02:26:33.491]  We're good to go.
[02:26:52.826 --> 02:26:56.628]  You've outlined more or less the process that we're going to follow.
[02:26:56.648 --> 02:26:57.608]  We're kind of raising the stakes.
[02:27:19.153 --> 02:27:25.359]  Challenging the governor, the lieutenant governor, the congressional delegation, asking, you know, where were they at the state convention?
[02:27:25.679 --> 02:27:30.303]  Why did they refuse to send a statement taking a position on Vermont?
[02:27:30.323 --> 02:27:30.664]  Stay there.
[02:27:30.704 --> 02:27:33.346]  We're going to fire your website on the other side and take some calls.
[02:27:36.109 --> 02:27:37.010]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.490 --> 02:27:39.111]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.032 --> 02:27:42.715]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.549 --> 02:27:47.531]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:27:47.591 --> 02:27:50.473]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:27:50.653 --> 02:27:56.038]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:27:56.278 --> 02:27:57.800]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:28:00.102]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:28:00.282 --> 02:28:03.765]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:28:04.185 --> 02:28:04.845]  We're good to go.

[02:28:47.889 --> 02:28:58.593]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.973 --> 02:29:03.495]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:03.555 --> 02:29:14.879]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.479 --> 02:29:22.323]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.723 --> 02:29:24.865]  Your purified water is now ready.

[02:30:55.123 --> 02:30:56.526]  Take a few calls and let him go.
[02:30:56.546 --> 02:30:58.029]  I really appreciate him spending time with us today.
[02:30:58.049 --> 02:31:01.917]  I've got a few other news items I want to hit in the last ten minutes or so of the broadcast.
[02:31:01.938 --> 02:31:02.399]  Stay with us.
[02:31:03.792 --> 02:31:08.295]  We're carrying several new books on the online bookstore InfoWars.com.
[02:31:08.836 --> 02:31:21.965]  One of them we just got in is Codex Magica, 624 pages long, over 1,000 photos, documents, and diagrams of world leaders and then their actual secret manuals on how they have a secret language.
[02:31:22.005 --> 02:31:22.865]  And that's what it is.
[02:31:23.986 --> 02:31:26.908]  They taught the Secret Service 100-something years ago secret hand signs.
[02:31:27.685 --> 02:31:36.191]  That's all secret societies are, or our ancient intelligence agencies, within mystical trappings, because that's what was believed in, you know, thousands of years ago.
[02:31:36.211 --> 02:31:42.356]  You know, universities were all underground and secret, because the incredible power of mathematics, all of this.
[02:31:42.376 --> 02:31:50.482]  Well, these same individuals have handed power down to their spoiled rotten children, to their spoiled rotten children, until we have this mega-decadent evil today.
[02:31:50.522 --> 02:31:52.784]  And Codex Magica, folks, is a bombshell event.
[02:31:53.324 --> 02:31:54.525]  The thing weighs two pounds.
[02:31:54.565 --> 02:31:55.526]  It's like a phone book.
[02:31:56.545 --> 02:31:59.949]  And it's $35, and it's well worth it.
[02:31:59.969 --> 02:32:01.911]  It's like four or five bucks, but it's so easy to read.
[02:32:01.931 --> 02:32:07.957]  The chapters are all just, believe me, you can't put it down, and it's got so much knowledge.
[02:32:08.177 --> 02:32:09.899]  And then you will know the secret language.
[02:32:10.139 --> 02:32:15.084]  It'll be like learning German or French or something else, but it's just hand signs and symbols.
[02:32:15.325 --> 02:32:16.626]  You can learn it very quickly.
[02:32:17.293 --> 02:32:20.676]  This is something you need, and you're not going to believe how you see this everywhere now.
[02:32:20.896 --> 02:32:23.959]  You'll see them flashing signs on TV and talking to each other.
[02:32:24.279 --> 02:32:26.761]  It's nothing but an intelligence agency flashing battle code.
[02:32:27.421 --> 02:32:29.864]  You need to get Codex Magica right now.
[02:32:29.904 --> 02:32:34.407]  We have another book that is 1995, and that's The Coming Battle.
[02:32:34.447 --> 02:32:38.651]  I read this about six years ago, five years ago, when it first came back into print.
[02:32:38.671 --> 02:32:43.455]  It's been out of print for over 100 years, and it was written...
[02:32:45.005 --> 02:32:54.960]  Back in 1898, and it's Lost for 100 Years, the book that tells the true story of how the banking money power gained control of America.
[02:32:55.440 --> 02:32:57.123]  And the incredible thing is, this was written...
[02:32:58.091 --> 02:33:14.534]  In 1898, published in 1899, and then, of course, 13 years later, we got the Federal Reserve, and he goes off their own documents, their own public admissions, the National Banking Association's talking about how to enslave us and how to centralize the government, how to buy up the newspapers.
[02:33:14.834 --> 02:33:19.475]  I mean, this is all... The thing is, you read this, and it's everything that's happened.
[02:33:19.715 --> 02:33:21.215]  That's what makes this so powerful.
[02:33:21.635 --> 02:33:24.936]  It's like prophecy or something, but it's not because the person writing it...
[02:33:27.012 --> 02:33:28.854]  Simply went over the facts.
[02:33:29.615 --> 02:33:37.145]  So, it's called The Coming Battle, and I hope that you will get it.
[02:33:37.165 --> 02:33:38.426]  It's by M.W.
[02:33:38.566 --> 02:33:38.987]  Wahlberg.
[02:33:39.810 --> 02:33:42.711]  And it was republished by some great folks.
[02:33:42.731 --> 02:33:44.311]  We're going to have them on the show next week.
[02:33:44.331 --> 02:33:46.152]  I haven't interviewed them in about five years about this book.
[02:33:46.172 --> 02:33:52.794]  But now that I'm really expanding my bookstore online and about to have a physical bookstore here in Austin, we're going to be carrying hundreds of titles.
[02:33:53.494 --> 02:33:56.815]  But we've got a hundred of these books in, and I hope you'll get The Coming Battle.
[02:33:57.255 --> 02:33:59.736]  While you're at it, get a Codex Magica and a Coming Battle.
[02:33:59.756 --> 02:34:04.418]  This is information you need to know to understand how this system really works.
[02:34:06.625 --> 02:34:09.868]  Toll-free number to get The Coming Battle or Codex Magicka is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:10.068 --> 02:34:12.410]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:34:12.810 --> 02:34:25.221]  Or go to InfoWars.com to order any of the books, the videos, the specials we've got running right now, any of the books on tape, T-shirts.
[02:34:25.581 --> 02:34:27.222]  It's all on InfoWars.com.
[02:34:27.242 --> 02:34:31.586]  You can read chapters of the books online, sample chapters you can read online.
[02:34:32.386 --> 02:34:33.428]  We're good to go.
[02:34:38.095 --> 02:34:39.475]  And they make great presents.
[02:34:39.515 --> 02:34:41.236]  Great birthday presents, great Christmas presents.
[02:34:41.696 --> 02:34:43.596]  A great way to wake somebody up, so do it today.
[02:34:43.636 --> 02:34:44.937]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:34:45.297 --> 02:34:47.017]  And never forget PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:34:47.077 --> 02:34:47.978]  Fifteen cents a day.
[02:34:48.678 --> 02:34:50.658]  All of my documentary films.
[02:34:50.998 --> 02:34:53.619]  A bunch of other films have been authorized to post.
[02:34:53.639 --> 02:34:55.700]  A bunch of other e-books have been authorized to post.
[02:34:56.020 --> 02:34:59.260]  My weekly TV reports of my best of Austin winning TV show.
[02:34:59.381 --> 02:35:01.661]  It's won that Reader's Bowl many, many years in a row.
[02:35:01.721 --> 02:35:03.101]  Best TV show period, many times.
[02:35:04.322 --> 02:35:04.482]  And...
[02:35:05.658 --> 02:35:09.140]  Special text reports, all our best audio interviews, hear from the show.
[02:35:09.440 --> 02:35:12.561]  Fifteen cents a day, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:35:13.421 --> 02:35:15.102]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[02:35:15.302 --> 02:35:19.944]  And we've been up for a year and a half now, and I want to thank all the members of prisonplanet.tv.
[02:35:19.964 --> 02:35:21.745]  But be sure and get The Coming Battle.
[02:35:22.065 --> 02:35:31.389]  Going back to our guest, who's just doing an amazing thing, moving towards secession for Vermont, and I would like to see that happen.
[02:35:31.869 --> 02:35:33.390]  I'd like to see the whole country adopt
[02:35:34.375 --> 02:35:35.616]  We have a couple of websites.
[02:35:35.736 --> 02:35:36.677]  One is vermontrepublic.org.
[02:36:04.305 --> 02:36:09.666]  It has a great deal of information about the Second Vermont Republic, including membership information.
[02:36:09.706 --> 02:36:13.847]  And then we have a monthly newspaper called Vermont Commons.
[02:36:14.307 --> 02:36:16.307]  It has its own separate website.
[02:36:16.367 --> 02:36:19.088]  It's called vtcommons.org.
[02:36:19.108 --> 02:36:25.629]  And so I would invite your listeners to visit either or both of those websites.
[02:36:25.969 --> 02:36:31.510]  In October alone, interestingly enough, is evidence that this is being taken seriously around the country.
[02:36:31.980 --> 02:36:37.222]  We had over 10,000 unique visits to the website.
[02:36:37.342 --> 02:36:39.883]  That was up from 1900, the previous month.
[02:36:40.223 --> 02:36:40.883]  Well, that's great.
[02:36:40.923 --> 02:36:42.083]  Give us those websites again.
[02:36:42.904 --> 02:36:50.146]  That's vermontrepublic.org and vtcommons.org.
[02:36:50.246 --> 02:36:59.729]  Now, you know full well if you guys start becoming successful, which I believe you will be successful to some degree, perhaps even go in the distance with this, if you keep it up,
[02:37:00.445 --> 02:37:01.947]  You know they're going to try dirty tricks on you.
[02:37:03.288 --> 02:37:05.290]  Well, I just don't like to think about that.
[02:37:05.631 --> 02:37:09.455]  People say, you know, how would the White House respond?
[02:37:10.035 --> 02:37:17.903]  I think it's safe to say they would not be very amused whether whoever is occupying the White House...
[02:37:18.925 --> 02:37:25.727]  But we're cautiously optimistic that part of what may... Well, I mean, you're mainstream.
[02:37:25.767 --> 02:37:31.829]  Again, you're not strutting around declaring yourself supreme ruler of the galaxy in a camouflage outfit.
[02:37:32.549 --> 02:37:41.452]  Right, and it's also kind of the absurdity of Vermont taking on the most powerful empire of all times, the USA.
[02:37:43.739 --> 02:37:48.205]  It's kind of classic David and Goliath.
[02:37:48.645 --> 02:37:52.290]  Sure, the federal government could snuff out Vermont, but what would they do?
[02:37:52.410 --> 02:37:54.993]  Burn all the sugar maples?
[02:37:55.073 --> 02:37:57.316]  Try and destroy the black and white Holsteins?
[02:37:57.396 --> 02:38:02.502]  Imagine trying to enslave independent-minded Vermonters.
[02:38:03.564 --> 02:38:14.995]  We take heart from the history of the Solidarity Movement over in Poland in the 1980s, which finally prevailed and drove out the communist regime in 1989.
[02:38:15.616 --> 02:38:19.840]  Many people anticipated that the Soviet Union would intervene, and it never happened.
[02:38:20.180 --> 02:38:22.743]  Well, that's because their own soldiers supported the Poles.
[02:38:23.377 --> 02:38:23.897]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:23.917 --> 02:38:26.079]  I mean, the polls had a lot of good friends.
[02:38:26.159 --> 02:38:33.563]  I mean, around Europe, the United States, the Roman Catholic Church, and Vermont has a lot of good friends as well, we think.
[02:38:33.763 --> 02:38:34.183]  Hopefully.
[02:38:35.324 --> 02:38:41.127]  Well, I think it's very important, and I think as long as a bunch of idiots don't get involved, it'll be okay.
[02:38:41.167 --> 02:38:43.188]  That's all we need in this is leadership.
[02:38:44.049 --> 02:38:51.273]  And a lot of times, I know that the independence movement in Texas was headed off on purpose by a bunch of morons.
[02:38:52.580 --> 02:38:56.682]  And it was just sad to see that because if any state can do it, it's Vermont or Texas.
[02:38:56.922 --> 02:39:01.124]  Yeah, I heard that Texas, the movements started kind of fighting amongst themselves.
[02:39:01.204 --> 02:39:01.845]  I hadn't followed it.
[02:39:01.925 --> 02:39:12.449]  Well, I mean, you don't day one declare yourself president or declare yourself general and start strutting around with an entourage, driving around in limousines and filing paperwork saying you own the Capitol.
[02:39:13.950 --> 02:39:15.111]  Give me $10 million.
[02:39:15.331 --> 02:39:16.431]  We're actually the opposite.
[02:39:16.451 --> 02:39:17.792]  We don't even have any offices.
[02:39:18.372 --> 02:39:27.018]  We have a very loose, informal kind of network, and it's really a group of entrepreneurs kind of doing their own thing.
[02:39:27.159 --> 02:39:27.799]  No, I know.
[02:39:27.959 --> 02:39:33.503]  What I'm saying is we have clear evidence the feds, on purpose, they had it off in Texas, did this on purpose.
[02:39:33.723 --> 02:39:35.084]  Right.
[02:39:35.184 --> 02:39:36.966]  It's agent provocateur business.
[02:39:37.266 --> 02:39:37.506]  Yeah.
[02:39:37.586 --> 02:39:42.369]  I mean, you've got to love these people that shoot their mouths off all day about, Alex doesn't call for violence, he's bad.
[02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:44.991]  But I hear them shooting their mouth off for ten years.
[02:39:45.031 --> 02:39:45.612]  They never do it.
[02:39:45.632 --> 02:39:46.032]  Yeah.
[02:39:46.912 --> 02:39:48.653]  I mean, the feds would love violence, folks.
[02:39:48.673 --> 02:39:49.054]  You're right.
[02:39:49.094 --> 02:39:59.379]  If it's people out there milking their Holsteins and people out there getting their maple syrup and people out there hanging out with the terrorists, people walking around with their guns, I mean, the feds couldn't move in.
[02:39:59.419 --> 02:40:02.020]  They've got to stage some provocation.
[02:40:02.281 --> 02:40:06.623]  Yeah, plus it just wouldn't play very well to snuff out of them.
[02:40:06.943 --> 02:40:09.244]  I mean, Vermont has no military bases.
[02:40:09.344 --> 02:40:14.025]  We have very few military contractors, no big cities, no big buildings.
[02:40:14.285 --> 02:40:20.127]  The only strategic resource we've got is an aging nuclear power plant.
[02:40:20.147 --> 02:40:23.308]  I mean, you know, what would they do with Vermont if they took it?
[02:40:25.129 --> 02:40:26.109]  Well, they'll never get away with that.
[02:40:26.149 --> 02:40:27.789]  They'll just try to demonize it and move against it.
[02:40:27.809 --> 02:40:28.570]  Well, I commend you.
[02:40:28.630 --> 02:40:29.090]  Godspeed.
[02:40:29.110 --> 02:40:31.330]  Let's take a few calls here quickly.
[02:40:31.610 --> 02:40:34.871]  Let's go ahead and... Oh, who's up first?
[02:40:34.891 --> 02:40:36.592]  I always get my call list all screwed up
[02:40:37.213 --> 02:40:38.214]  Ruben in Ohio.
[02:40:38.314 --> 02:40:39.134]  Ruben, you're on the air.
[02:40:39.174 --> 02:40:39.615]  Go ahead.
[02:40:40.375 --> 02:40:42.636]  Hey, some things never change.
[02:40:42.656 --> 02:40:46.699]  And when you read the Constitution, it's amazing how similar it is to today.
[02:40:47.279 --> 02:40:50.181]  It talks about fighting tyranny and King George.
[02:40:50.621 --> 02:40:53.703]  And the name George is mentioned so many times as the enemy.
[02:40:54.864 --> 02:40:59.026]  And I believe for some time now, like all the senators are completely corrupt.
[02:40:59.567 --> 02:41:01.708]  I'm reading the Franklin cover-up right now.
[02:41:01.728 --> 02:41:05.030]  It's just amazing how corrupt the whole system of justice could be from...
[02:41:05.646 --> 02:41:08.688]  From the sheriff to the governor to the judges and everything.
[02:41:09.689 --> 02:41:17.075]  But what would you guys do economically if you were to succeed?
[02:41:17.095 --> 02:41:24.260]  Yeah, what would you do if you didn't have half your wealth being sucked off by international corporations?
[02:41:24.340 --> 02:41:25.641]  Hopefully we would thrive.
[02:41:27.443 --> 02:41:32.767]  Many people don't realize that of the 200 independent nation states in the world,
[02:41:33.845 --> 02:41:38.950]  50 of them are actually smaller than tiny Vermont with our 620,000 population.
[02:41:39.650 --> 02:41:47.097]  Of the 10 richest countries in the world by per capita income, 5 of those are smaller than Vermont.
[02:41:47.237 --> 02:41:48.078]  Oh yeah, always.
[02:41:48.178 --> 02:41:51.500]  Teeny independent free market systems are dynamos.
[02:41:51.601 --> 02:41:52.301]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:41:52.441 --> 02:41:57.886]  And I mean, you know, the Icelands, the Lichtensteins, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, these are all
[02:41:58.490 --> 02:42:01.392]  Much smaller than Vermont, and they're in the top five.
[02:42:01.432 --> 02:42:03.213]  And what are the globalists trying to do?
[02:42:03.233 --> 02:42:05.235]  They're trying to shut down all those safe harbors.
[02:42:05.735 --> 02:42:06.636]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:06.876 --> 02:42:12.780]  And people say, well, it turns out for every dollar we pay to the feds, we get back about $1.13 or $1.14.
[02:42:15.041 --> 02:42:21.385]  But that's really a wash when you consider the number of unfunded and underfunded mandated programs.
[02:42:21.405 --> 02:42:22.226]  Yeah, that's not true.
[02:42:22.266 --> 02:42:23.547]  I mean, maybe there's a few states.
[02:42:23.607 --> 02:42:25.708]  I didn't know it was about Vermont that get more back than they pay.
[02:42:25.748 --> 02:42:26.829]  I know Louisiana's like that.
[02:42:26.849 --> 02:42:28.870]  What do you mean get more back than they pay?
[02:42:28.890 --> 02:42:31.832]  I mean, they come in and pay for check.
[02:42:31.852 --> 02:42:33.253]  But see, I'm saying it's misleading.
[02:42:33.273 --> 02:42:34.674]  But we don't want these services.
[02:42:34.714 --> 02:42:35.915]  These services are bad.
[02:42:35.955 --> 02:42:37.176]  Right, right.
[02:42:37.216 --> 02:42:43.100]  See, we're forced to pay for many of these underfunded and unfunded programs that are not included in that $1 program.
[02:42:44.031 --> 02:42:46.900]  And so if you take that into consideration, it's not a loss.
[02:42:47.642 --> 02:42:51.032]  And then some people worry about, well, what about the national debt?
[02:42:51.876 --> 02:42:53.557]  Would Vermont have to pay its share of that?
[02:42:53.597 --> 02:43:02.843]  Well, if you assume that the net worth of the United States is positive, that the total assets exceed the liabilities, which I'm prepared to argue... Let me just stop you right there.
[02:43:02.903 --> 02:43:04.724]  That Federal Reserve System is a fraud.
[02:43:05.545 --> 02:43:08.166]  Its own founders admitted it was designed to get us in debt.
[02:43:08.367 --> 02:43:09.127]  We don't owe that.
[02:43:09.988 --> 02:43:13.950]  Well, what I'm saying is maybe Vermont should claim a rebate.
[02:43:14.150 --> 02:43:19.213]  In other words, if we have positive net worth, Vermont should claim part of the assets.
[02:43:20.498 --> 02:43:21.638]  But the truth is we don't.
[02:43:21.698 --> 02:43:22.959]  We're basically bankrupt.
[02:43:23.299 --> 02:43:26.279]  Well, there's also the Comprehensive Annual Finance Review.
[02:43:26.299 --> 02:43:28.280]  There's an article in the American Free Press about it.
[02:43:29.140 --> 02:43:31.321]  There's money hidden all over this country.
[02:43:31.401 --> 02:43:41.323]  Well, yeah, what cities and counties and water districts do is they have their budget, which is their public books, what they decide to spend, and they have all their investments, which normally is two or three times bigger than their total budget.
[02:43:41.563 --> 02:43:46.384]  I was kind of amused by the gold advertisement earlier on your show, Alex.
[02:43:46.424 --> 02:43:48.865]  One of the ways we like to express it is that
[02:43:49.477 --> 02:43:57.101]  Every time George Bush opens his mouth, we recruit more members and the price of gold goes up, and the two are not unrelated.
[02:43:58.262 --> 02:43:58.882]  Well, that's true.
[02:43:58.902 --> 02:43:59.423]  Thanks, Reuben.
[02:43:59.463 --> 02:44:01.504]  Elias in Michigan, here on the air with our guest.
[02:44:02.844 --> 02:44:03.245]  Our guest.
[02:44:03.645 --> 02:44:03.905]  Hi.
[02:44:04.345 --> 02:44:04.946]  Yeah, do me a favor.
[02:44:05.006 --> 02:44:05.806]  Turn your radio off.
[02:44:05.906 --> 02:44:06.467]  Yeah, it is off.
[02:44:06.747 --> 02:44:06.967]  Okay.
[02:44:07.167 --> 02:44:07.487]  It's off.
[02:44:08.227 --> 02:44:09.088]  Yeah, Mr. Naylor.
[02:44:09.248 --> 02:44:09.368]  Hi.
[02:44:09.388 --> 02:44:10.109]  Yes, hi.
[02:44:10.469 --> 02:44:12.890]  How would you go about doing that in another state?
[02:44:13.530 --> 02:44:14.371]  For instance, Michigan.
[02:44:15.186 --> 02:44:19.851]  Oh, the reasons why Vermont... I mean, how would we go about trying to do such a thing?
[02:44:19.892 --> 02:44:23.115]  You know, trying to organize... Exactly the same way we've been doing.
[02:44:23.175 --> 02:44:29.222]  I mean, the reasons why Vermont wants to secede are absolutely not unique to Vermont.
[02:44:29.282 --> 02:44:31.224]  Yes, sir, you just start your own political party...
[02:44:33.246 --> 02:44:33.986]  Well, I don't know.
[02:44:34.026 --> 02:44:35.587]  I was just wondering how it could be done.
[02:44:35.627 --> 02:44:36.687]  Well, I'm telling you.
[02:44:36.887 --> 02:44:46.132]  We've actually received some letters and phone calls from people in Michigan last year who were strongly interested in starting a company.
[02:44:46.312 --> 02:44:47.112]  It's serious, sir.
[02:44:47.172 --> 02:44:50.234]  You just go out and recruit like-minded people.
[02:44:50.694 --> 02:44:52.655]  Michigan was a rebel state, of course.
[02:44:53.075 --> 02:44:54.956]  I mean, a rebel against the Fed, you know.
[02:44:55.416 --> 02:44:56.517]  But you've got a problem.
[02:44:56.877 --> 02:45:00.859]  Even if you did accomplish such a thing in your wildest imagination...
[02:45:01.894 --> 02:45:05.095]  What would you do about the big power that's got us into these?
[02:45:05.572 --> 02:45:08.093]  This pickle, you might say, what's going on now?
[02:45:08.413 --> 02:45:10.373]  And that, of course, is corporate power.
[02:45:10.654 --> 02:45:11.714]  What would you do about it?
[02:45:11.754 --> 02:45:13.434]  Elias, let me comment on that.
[02:45:13.534 --> 02:45:16.055]  We address that corporate power.
[02:45:16.115 --> 02:45:21.237]  We point out where bad corporations are abusing and colluding and engaging in racketeering.
[02:45:21.697 --> 02:45:30.939]  And we have the country or the counties within the country of Vermont indict those individuals if they're engaging in criminal activity.
[02:45:31.219 --> 02:45:32.760]  We start enforcing the laws...
[02:45:33.820 --> 02:45:37.421]  That we have codified the common law against these individuals.
[02:45:37.441 --> 02:45:40.902]  But instead of always talking about how in our wildest dreams have this happened.
[02:45:41.102 --> 02:45:43.943]  As long as we say it's in our wildest dreams, it's never going to happen.
[02:45:44.283 --> 02:45:46.264]  In our wildest dreams, we go to the new world.
[02:45:46.464 --> 02:45:50.565]  In our wildest dreams, we invent a car that isn't pulled by horses.
[02:45:50.905 --> 02:45:58.852]  In our wildest dreams, I can be in a studio here on Main Street in Austin, Texas, talking to Minnesota satellite uplinks.
[02:45:58.872 --> 02:46:00.113]  You're listening off however you're listening.
[02:46:00.353 --> 02:46:02.275]  You know, sir, we really can do this.
[02:46:02.315 --> 02:46:03.216]  This is popular.
[02:46:03.816 --> 02:46:11.343]  And so just the mere fact that you're interested in this, that you have this idea, the journey of a thousand miles does start with a single step.
[02:46:11.583 --> 02:46:12.824]  Thanks for the call, Elias.
[02:46:12.864 --> 02:46:15.126]  Comments on what he was just asking there?
[02:46:16.744 --> 02:46:17.905]  Do you have any comments on it?
[02:46:17.985 --> 02:46:20.606]  Yeah, well, he mentioned big corporations.
[02:46:20.666 --> 02:46:22.086]  Take Walmart, for example.
[02:46:22.446 --> 02:46:26.168]  So long as Vermont, we were the last state to get a Walmart.
[02:46:26.188 --> 02:46:28.209]  We kept them at bay for about 10 years.
[02:46:28.269 --> 02:46:30.730]  We now have four and about to get seven more.
[02:46:31.434 --> 02:46:38.221]  But our hands are tied to try and keep them out or to rein them in so long as we're part of the United States.
[02:46:38.581 --> 02:46:44.027]  But if we split from the United States, we can say to Walmart, cease and desist.
[02:46:44.067 --> 02:46:48.031]  Or we can say, we're going to have a nice special tax just for Walmart.
[02:46:48.431 --> 02:46:52.273]  So that you cover the cost that you're imposing on our community.
[02:46:52.533 --> 02:46:58.877]  Because Walmart really is, of the 100 biggest economies, 44 of them are companies, and Walmart is the biggest of that.
[02:46:58.917 --> 02:47:04.741]  It is actually a country that makes all of its suppliers... Oh, yeah, Walmart is the great Satan of corporate America.
[02:47:04.801 --> 02:47:06.161]  Well, I mean, let's boil this down why they are.
[02:47:06.181 --> 02:47:06.962]  They're not free market.
[02:47:07.002 --> 02:47:07.622]  It's a monopoly.
[02:47:08.082 --> 02:47:12.905]  They use Chinese slave goods mainly, and they were the first to really get this going, to leverage out their competition.
[02:47:12.945 --> 02:47:17.308]  They demand that all their suppliers sell to them at under their cost...
[02:47:17.768 --> 02:47:18.509]  We're good to go.
[02:47:18.529 --> 02:47:18.709]  I think?
[02:47:39.640 --> 02:47:51.673]  They created it just like a wedge move, you know, busting open somebody's... It's very obvious in the northeast kingdom of Vermont, where there was a Walmart in New Hampshire across the river, and it did exactly what you described.
[02:47:53.054 --> 02:47:54.856]  Yeah, it's devastating.
[02:47:55.036 --> 02:47:55.276]  Yeah.
[02:47:55.777 --> 02:47:58.119]  But Walmart's going to get its comeuppancies.
[02:47:58.479 --> 02:48:01.743]  The cheap oil endgame is going to take them out.
[02:48:04.614 --> 02:48:06.635]  Well, they are a very evil organization.
[02:48:07.655 --> 02:48:12.738]  They've got the FBI up there, basically runs their data center up in Arkansas.
[02:48:13.038 --> 02:48:14.458]  Yeah, they're incredibly powerful.
[02:48:15.299 --> 02:48:16.499]  Well, they're basically merged.
[02:48:16.899 --> 02:48:23.262]  It was Walmart, the Defense Department, that ordered all manufacturers of all products two years ago to put RFID in their products.
[02:48:23.442 --> 02:48:24.443]  Well, I didn't know about that.
[02:48:24.603 --> 02:48:30.145]  Yeah, and it was Walmart that finally forced the adoption in 1986 of the Universal Product Code.
[02:48:30.936 --> 02:48:31.376]  Interesting.
[02:48:31.677 --> 02:48:32.617]  Yeah, it's a government front.
[02:48:32.637 --> 02:48:33.078]  I can believe it.
[02:48:33.378 --> 02:48:34.138]  It's a government front.
[02:48:34.218 --> 02:48:35.279]  Always has been.
[02:48:35.399 --> 02:48:36.780]  Just like Microsoft's government front.
[02:48:37.140 --> 02:48:37.781]  Stay there, sir.
[02:48:37.861 --> 02:48:38.441]  Final segment.
[02:48:38.461 --> 02:48:40.322]  We'll jam in Kevin and Alex.
[02:48:41.103 --> 02:48:42.424]  And that'll be it for calls.
[02:48:42.444 --> 02:48:43.304]  Stay with us.
[02:48:43.544 --> 02:48:44.485]  Transmission continues.
[02:48:46.753 --> 02:48:49.637]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.878 --> 02:48:50.559]  Hello, my friends.
[02:48:50.659 --> 02:48:51.460]  Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.800 --> 02:48:56.487]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.807 --> 02:49:03.537]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:49:03.857 --> 02:49:05.859]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.059 --> 02:49:08.901]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.981 --> 02:49:13.665]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.845 --> 02:49:18.268]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.509 --> 02:49:25.714]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:25.975 --> 02:49:28.396]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:51:23.975 --> 02:51:25.796]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:53.795 --> 02:51:55.877]  Well, it's the final segment.
[02:51:57.638 --> 02:51:58.619]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[02:51:59.560 --> 02:52:03.303]  11 to 2 during the day, and of course, at night, 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[02:52:05.224 --> 02:52:14.852]  And let's real fast go to two final calls for our guest, who's trying to get sovereignty for Vermont away from the corporation that took over America and destroyed it.
[02:52:15.693 --> 02:52:17.794]  Kevin and Mash, and then Alex and Mash.
[02:52:17.834 --> 02:52:18.495]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:52:19.115 --> 02:52:19.936]  Good day, Mr. Jones.
[02:52:19.956 --> 02:52:21.377]  Good day, Mr. Naylor.
[02:52:21.397 --> 02:52:22.318]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:52:22.988 --> 02:52:35.560]  I live and work in Massachusetts, but my wife and I recently bought a new home in Vermont, and although my questions are a little bit specific to my situation, I think it would be an interesting way to examine how secession might work in this situation.
[02:52:35.980 --> 02:52:38.643]  Could I change my residency to Vermont?
[02:52:39.432 --> 02:52:41.114]  I don't see why not.
[02:52:41.194 --> 02:52:44.077]  I can't see any reason why you couldn't become a citizen.
[02:52:44.197 --> 02:52:45.238]  You ought to come on up.
[02:52:45.298 --> 02:52:46.119]  And certainly, I would...
[02:53:04.104 --> 02:53:10.892]  I prefer to, given my druthers, to choose the rights that I would have as a Vermont citizen compared to the rights I have as a Massachusetts citizen.
[02:53:10.992 --> 02:53:11.873]  Welcome to the club!
[02:53:12.992 --> 02:53:15.034]  You should have been at our convention last week.
[02:53:15.354 --> 02:53:16.675]  Well, that's what I'm wondering.
[02:53:16.715 --> 02:53:20.218]  Would someone like... I would not be viewed as an outsider by your organization.
[02:53:20.918 --> 02:53:24.401]  Actually, we have quite a few members from Massachusetts, from all over New England.
[02:53:24.541 --> 02:53:26.283]  You could also make it like Switzerland.
[02:53:26.963 --> 02:53:31.207]  And you could have a safe banking system there, because Switzerland isn't safe anymore.
[02:53:32.408 --> 02:53:34.550]  Switzerland is probably my favorite country.
[02:53:34.630 --> 02:53:36.271]  It's had a lot of influence on our thinking.
[02:53:36.551 --> 02:53:40.293]  Well, the prior caller asked about what industry could you have.
[02:53:40.393 --> 02:53:51.540]  By just doing business in an honest fashion, I think you would find, for instance, banking and things like that would be, to talk about the Cayman Islands and things as they say.
[02:53:51.560 --> 02:53:55.042]  And then no multi-jurisdictional task force goons busting down doors.
[02:53:56.103 --> 02:53:56.963]  We're out of time, Kevin.
[02:53:57.003 --> 02:53:57.944]  Thanks for the great points.
[02:53:58.524 --> 02:53:59.345]  Thanks.
[02:53:59.425 --> 02:54:00.926]  Let's talk to Alex at Mass.
[02:54:00.946 --> 02:54:01.586]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:54:01.906 --> 02:54:05.008]  Yeah, I'm just really excited to hear this, and I'm also thinking about
[02:54:05.834 --> 02:54:08.456]  Going up to Vermont and having real freedom.
[02:54:08.476 --> 02:54:09.857]  Yeah, come check us out.
[02:54:10.077 --> 02:54:11.939]  Yeah, it's definitely really hard.
[02:54:12.139 --> 02:54:17.723]  I'm doing as much as I can telling people about the evil that is corrupting America.
[02:54:17.743 --> 02:54:22.307]  And that I'm not just some crazy liberal or whatever kind of label that people want to give me.
[02:54:22.347 --> 02:54:24.028]  Well, mass is one of the worst.
[02:54:24.249 --> 02:54:31.554]  They even have the income tax inspections of your house and how many pairs of socks you get every year with some bureaucrat poking around your house.
[02:54:31.674 --> 02:54:32.735]  I would never live there.
[02:54:32.995 --> 02:54:34.737]  It's a price for our standard of living.
[02:54:35.097 --> 02:54:39.522]  Yeah, we had quite a few people from Massachusetts at the convention last week.
[02:54:39.682 --> 02:54:44.506]  Well, obviously, I mean, two calls in a row from Mass because they want to escape to Vermont.
[02:54:44.566 --> 02:54:48.470]  Yeah, so we've actually got members in 20 different states, Alex.
[02:54:48.831 --> 02:54:57.960]  Yeah, well, I live right next to the bridge in Concord, so we've got plenty of minds that are in that mindset, but I don't think they have all the facts.
[02:54:59.542 --> 02:55:01.783]  Yeah, because their alternative media is not large enough.
[02:55:02.123 --> 02:55:02.683]  Yeah.
[02:55:02.723 --> 02:55:05.223]  Have a look at our website and consider joining us.
[02:55:05.263 --> 02:55:05.563]  All right.
[02:55:05.603 --> 02:55:06.264]  We're out of time.
[02:55:06.324 --> 02:55:07.384]  Thank you for the call, Alex.
[02:55:07.444 --> 02:55:08.884]  And thank you, sir, for coming on.
[02:55:08.924 --> 02:55:10.185]  Our guest, Thomas H. Naylor.
[02:55:10.225 --> 02:55:11.885]  It's really a pleasure, Alex.
[02:55:11.925 --> 02:55:12.825]  Thanks for having me on.
[02:55:13.065 --> 02:55:14.045]  Oh, thank you for coming on.
[02:55:14.065 --> 02:55:15.706]  We'll look forward to having you on as this progresses.
[02:55:16.026 --> 02:55:16.466]  I hope so.
[02:55:16.686 --> 02:55:17.126]  Take care.
[02:55:17.406 --> 02:55:17.646]  Bye.
[02:55:17.986 --> 02:55:19.447]  We're out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:20.127 --> 02:55:21.547]  You've got to think big, okay?
[02:55:21.567 --> 02:55:25.568]  You've got to go for the gusto, as they say in the cheesy beer commercial.
[02:55:26.268 --> 02:55:26.828]  But it's true.
[02:55:27.008 --> 02:55:28.669]  I mean, this is how our country was founded.
[02:55:28.769 --> 02:55:29.149]  And believe me,
[02:55:30.547 --> 02:55:32.369]  It isn't America running America anymore.
[02:55:32.769 --> 02:55:36.131]  So I want to secede and then have a union with those states.
[02:55:36.431 --> 02:55:38.672]  I want to get America back, and this is one of the only ways to do it.
[02:55:39.012 --> 02:55:39.993]  I've thought about this a lot.
[02:55:41.054 --> 02:55:45.616]  Christian Science Monitor and others are reporting that Alito is pro-abortion.
[02:55:46.317 --> 02:55:47.077]  Very conservative.
[02:55:47.497 --> 02:55:48.818]  And here are the top headlines I've got.
[02:55:49.138 --> 02:55:49.979]  Flu threatens...
[02:55:51.122 --> 02:55:52.884]  Threats could restrict U.S.
[02:55:52.924 --> 02:55:53.264]  travel.
[02:55:53.684 --> 02:55:54.185]  Newsmax.
[02:55:54.465 --> 02:55:55.446]  Total martial law.
[02:55:55.466 --> 02:55:56.126]  Just in your face.
[02:55:56.386 --> 02:56:00.089]  Bush openly says he wants the six plus billion bucks to pay for this martial law.
[02:56:00.790 --> 02:56:04.252]  And experts dismiss scare over bird flu, Gainesville Sun.
[02:56:05.073 --> 02:56:05.674]  Here's another one.
[02:56:05.994 --> 02:56:07.915]  Is President Bush hyping the avian flu?
[02:56:07.935 --> 02:56:08.956]  Of course he is.
[02:56:10.357 --> 02:56:12.359]  Flu doctors would be giving police guards...
[02:56:14.455 --> 02:56:16.216]  All these reasons for martial law.
[02:56:16.556 --> 02:56:17.936]  Reason after reason after reason.
[02:56:17.956 --> 02:56:18.937]  There's always a new reason.
[02:56:19.297 --> 02:56:20.557]  Folks, we know who's behind all this.
[02:56:20.597 --> 02:56:21.618]  It's the corrupt globalists.
[02:56:21.858 --> 02:56:22.898]  Now get out there and take them on.
[02:56:22.918 --> 02:56:23.678]  God bless you all.
