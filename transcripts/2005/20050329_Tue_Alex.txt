[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.321]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.981 --> 00:00:08.042]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:09.843]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.503 --> 00:00:11.344]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.084 --> 00:00:12.965]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:17.307]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.828 --> 00:00:21.910]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.872 --> 00:00:38.313]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:38.473 --> 00:00:41.975]  Thank you so much for joining us live on this Tuesday edition.
[00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.617]  The 29th day of March 2005.
[00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:52.020]  We'll be live for the next three hours right here on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:53.581 --> 00:00:56.462]  And we're going to take a lot of your phone calls in this first hour.
[00:00:56.582 --> 00:01:01.185]  I know many of you are chomping at the bit to talk about the Terri Schiavo Schindler case.
[00:01:02.746 --> 00:01:04.867]  And she is clearly in her last days.
[00:01:06.002 --> 00:01:06.983]  Or end of days.
[00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:10.985]  Not long for this world, as they say.
[00:01:11.005 --> 00:01:13.606]  A true travesty of justice.
[00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:18.869]  A true public execution and torture.
[00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:21.390]  It is truly brutal.
[00:01:23.351 --> 00:01:26.793]  Also, we'll be talking about the huge earthquake yesterday.
[00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:27.694]  They first said it was an 8.3.
[00:01:27.754 --> 00:01:29.715]  By the end of the day it was an 8.7 and hundreds are dead.
[00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:42.913]  On top of all of this, the Times of London is reporting depressed Coffey Annan close to quitting over U.N.
[00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:43.613]  scandals.
[00:01:44.374 --> 00:01:46.075]  And who's waiting in the wings?
[00:01:47.556 --> 00:01:48.736]  Bill Clinton!
[00:01:49.077 --> 00:01:51.138]  William Jefferson Clinton!
[00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:57.481]  And we've got Wolfie Wits, clearly going to be our new World Bank head.
[00:01:58.122 --> 00:01:59.503]  They're putting in the
[00:02:00.416 --> 00:02:02.357]  The little neocons left and right.
[00:02:02.397 --> 00:02:06.878]  And by neocons, Bill Clinton was for the war in Serbia, the neocon idea.
[00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:10.180]  Bill Clinton is all for the Iraq war.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:20.944]  And George Bush has been protecting him all along, blocking release of documents, ordering Congress, which I didn't think the executive could do, to not investigate Clinton.
[00:02:22.504 --> 00:02:26.766]  So we'll get into the geopolitical landscape and what it's shaping up.
[00:02:27.346 --> 00:02:29.447]  Ebola-like virus deaths in Angola,
[00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:38.031]  We've had two of the biggest earthquakes in recorded history just in the last four months.
[00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:00.611]  Less than four months.
[00:03:02.652 --> 00:03:09.675]  And at the same time, there's a whole bunch of new developments concerning Terri Schiavo.
[00:03:10.336 --> 00:03:21.740]  Terri's demonstrating her will to live, follow the Constitution, Governor Bush, grant clemency to Terri Schiavo Schindler.
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.783]  At the same time, different law enforcement groups are calling for a criminal investigation and a freeze
[00:03:28.924 --> 00:03:33.505]  on the dehydration and murder of Terri Schiavo Schindler.
[00:03:34.645 --> 00:03:50.049]  But as we learned over the weekend, they were already sending state police to rescue her, but the little Pinellas Park police said they were going to have a standoff with them, and even joked how many of us can hold off the National Guard, and Jeb Bush did absolutely nothing.
[00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:53.110]  He can harden drug dealers.
[00:03:54.353 --> 00:03:57.574]  His brother can pardon drug dealers and murderers.
[00:03:58.114 --> 00:04:00.854]  Bill Clinton can do it, but we can't do it for this woman.
[00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:09.076]  And it's been said a thousand times, I'll say it again, you can't execute an ex-murderer the way they're executing Terry.
[00:04:10.637 --> 00:04:12.317]  And I've heard so much incredible spin.
[00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:21.839]  The Associated Press is reporting that, oh, she's being cared for and treated at the hospital, and she's only had her food taken away.
[00:04:22.483 --> 00:04:22.923]  Well, no.
[00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:24.985]  She's had her food and water taken away.
[00:04:25.005 --> 00:04:26.906]  And she's not being cared for.
[00:04:27.307 --> 00:04:28.468]  She's being murdered!
[00:04:29.108 --> 00:04:31.190]  So stop redefining reality.
[00:04:32.431 --> 00:04:34.012]  Stop editing reality.
[00:04:34.932 --> 00:04:39.496]  Stop engaging in these semantical frauds.
[00:04:41.537 --> 00:04:45.460]  There is so much other key news and information coming up.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.342]  We have a big guest in the second hour.
[00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:53.054]  This so happens to be a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:04:53.074 --> 00:04:55.956]  They'll be talking about torture with us.
[00:04:56.797 --> 00:04:57.938]  You don't want to miss that.
[00:04:57.958 --> 00:05:00.620]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.463]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.643 --> 00:05:10.046]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.207 --> 00:05:14.590]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:15.951]  The New World Order.
[00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:17.692]  Panama!
[00:05:17.752 --> 00:05:21.975]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.035 --> 00:05:28.960]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:31.202]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.442 --> 00:05:41.869]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.790]  If you want to understand
[00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.495]  If you don't understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!

[00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.231]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:06.354]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:10.779]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:12.020]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:16.905]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.385 --> 00:06:19.527]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.007 --> 00:06:34.739]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:41.825]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:00.465 --> 00:07:04.169]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:05.610]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:10.796]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[00:07:10.936 --> 00:07:14.299]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:16.321]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:16.842]  Cardivite.
[00:07:16.862 --> 00:07:17.362]  Cardivite.
[00:07:17.422 --> 00:07:18.964]  We all use Cardivite!
[00:07:19.813 --> 00:07:23.294]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.

[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.300]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.361]  Turtle bite is a natural thing.
[00:07:40.481 --> 00:07:42.842]  It gets you to the edge like you've never seen.
[00:07:42.862 --> 00:07:44.742]  It makes you feel good.
[00:08:02.347 --> 00:08:08.369]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:08.969 --> 00:08:12.011]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:26.796]  Alright, second segment, 8 minutes, 25 seconds into its first hour.
[00:08:28.729 --> 00:08:29.970]  That confuses some people.
[00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.071]  They say, second segment, we just tuned in to you.
[00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:33.151]  We were just listening to the news.
[00:08:34.032 --> 00:08:36.233]  I think it's fine if our affiliates carry the news.
[00:08:38.534 --> 00:08:44.858]  But to be quite frank with you folks, we cover the real news in the first five minutes of each hour.
[00:08:46.138 --> 00:08:53.102]  We cover a lot more news than you hear on most of these news feeds on the different networks out there.
[00:08:53.182 --> 00:08:58.045]  Some of the broadcasts on our network choose to have news play before their shows.
[00:08:59.424 --> 00:09:00.826]  And that's their prerogative.
[00:09:01.787 --> 00:09:14.779]  But I choose to not have it because more of our stations do want that first little five minute segment and they opt out of the supposed news and just get it here.
[00:09:14.859 --> 00:09:20.505]  So we are into our second segment now and I do have a Council on Foreign Relations member
[00:09:21.221 --> 00:09:35.310]  His book is published by the Council on Foreign Relations, that organization openly calling for world government with most prominent members of academia, finance, government, media, the arts being members of it.
[00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:42.474]  And this member of the CFR has written a book that I agree with against torture.
[00:09:43.815 --> 00:09:50.659]  And so we're going to be having him on to talk about torture and who knows, maybe a little bit about the CFR.
[00:09:51.949 --> 00:09:56.411]  Because the CFR, of course, does have its token good members in it.
[00:09:57.171 --> 00:10:03.974]  I guess kind of for PR purposes, but this is an interview you do not want to miss coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:10:04.634 --> 00:10:07.055]  Well, at the start of the next hour, in the middle of the broadcast.
[00:10:08.115 --> 00:10:12.157]  The middle third of this transmission against tyranny.
[00:10:12.797 --> 00:10:14.578]  Boy, I tell you, I'm awake now.
[00:10:15.758 --> 00:10:19.720]  I had just gotten some coffee kind of late in the morning.
[00:10:21.198 --> 00:10:37.343]  I had it sitting up here on my broadcast desk and for some reason was grabbing at some papers under the stack and knocked the whole giant brimming container that I just got at the Rockefeller Exxon into my lap.
[00:10:38.664 --> 00:10:40.986]  Yes, I was up late working last night.
[00:10:41.426 --> 00:10:46.049]  I did the Jeff Wrench radio program and then did about three hours of research after that.
[00:10:46.089 --> 00:10:47.610]  So I went to sleep about 3 a.m.
[00:10:48.171 --> 00:10:52.273]  Still got up pretty early this morning, but never got around to making any coffee.
[00:10:52.814 --> 00:11:02.560]  So when I left the house and went to the office, I pulled in and got some coffee and just a few minutes after I had gotten into the studio in the middle of that last break, spilt it into my lap.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.803]  So I am, I think, more awake now than if I would have drunk that coffee.
[00:11:08.257 --> 00:11:11.480]  Alright, enough with the mindless issues.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:14.362]  I don't think you tune in to hear me talk about coffee, do you?
[00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:21.247]  Bill in Ireland, and Kenneth in Louisiana, James in North Carolina, Johnny in Canada, John in Texas.
[00:11:21.887 --> 00:11:23.608]  We're going to go to your calls here in just a few minutes.
[00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:25.510]  I want to do things a little bit different today.
[00:11:26.030 --> 00:11:28.272]  I normally go to calls about 30 minutes into the broadcast.
[00:11:28.292 --> 00:11:30.914]  We're just going to go to your calls basically immediately.
[00:11:30.934 --> 00:11:33.796]  And then I'll get into Depressed Annan.
[00:11:33.856 --> 00:11:34.857]  That's Coffee Annan.
[00:11:36.775 --> 00:11:38.716]  For those educated in the government training camps.
[00:11:39.837 --> 00:11:41.779]  Close to quitting over U.N.
[00:11:41.859 --> 00:11:42.419]  scandals.
[00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.363]  And a lot of our conservative listeners are probably saying, hooray!
[00:11:47.443 --> 00:11:48.484]  Hip hip hooray!
[00:11:48.504 --> 00:11:51.646]  I mean, Kofi Annan's involved in white slavery rings.
[00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:55.789]  Kofi Annan's involved in bid rigging and scamming and U.N.
[00:11:55.829 --> 00:11:57.230]  food for oil frauds.
[00:11:58.271 --> 00:11:58.911]  He's horrible!
[00:11:59.672 --> 00:12:01.493]  Sex orgies at the U.N.
[00:12:02.814 --> 00:12:03.394]  He's horrible!
[00:12:03.434 --> 00:12:04.235]  They're all horrible!
[00:12:04.961 --> 00:12:10.524]  He's a lot better, though, than Kirk Valtime, the SS officer who hunted down American soldiers and killed them.
[00:12:11.364 --> 00:12:13.365]  He's like a demon compared to Satan.
[00:12:14.106 --> 00:12:17.407]  Yes, he's of hell, but is he the worst?
[00:12:17.427 --> 00:12:23.430]  Of course, there really is no lesser of two evils, so it's all part and parcel of the same flock of blackbirds.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.003]  At the same time, we have Kofi Annan talking about leaving, and Bill Clinton's lined up.
[00:12:32.063 --> 00:12:37.145]  He's got six of the G8, excuse me, seven of the G8 lined up.
[00:12:37.205 --> 00:12:44.369]  It's been in major publications for four years that Lord Clinton wants to be Secretary General, and it's the U.S.'
[00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.869]  's turn.
[00:12:44.889 --> 00:12:46.630]  The U.S.
[00:12:46.670 --> 00:12:49.511]  has never had a Secretary General.
[00:12:51.752 --> 00:12:54.794]  Never had a Secretary General, and so
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.701]  We're going to get into why this is shaping up to happen.
[00:12:59.842 --> 00:13:04.643]  Of course, Ebola-like virus deaths rise in Angola.
[00:13:04.683 --> 00:13:06.144]  Travel warning issued.
[00:13:06.164 --> 00:13:17.328]  Hundreds died in the Indonesian quake that was an 8.7 right in the same area as the quake that killed hundreds of thousands via tsunamis back on the 26th of December.
[00:13:19.352 --> 00:13:21.594]  And hundreds are confirmed dead.
[00:13:21.674 --> 00:13:26.838]  They're saying thousands may have died, but not from rising water this time, but from collapsing buildings.
[00:13:27.478 --> 00:13:32.122]  In some areas, some of the islands that were hit by quakes, the quake went on for six minutes.
[00:13:34.423 --> 00:13:38.667]  The question is, is this a precursor to something larger?
[00:13:39.187 --> 00:13:44.111]  Volcanic and tectonic activity is at world record levels.
[00:13:45.603 --> 00:13:49.365]  Lot of new Terri Schiavo developments as well.
[00:13:49.485 --> 00:13:53.267]  Fathers of Schiavo weak but responding.
[00:13:53.287 --> 00:13:59.790]  And now the blood is reportedly coming out of her mouth, her eyes, other areas.
[00:14:00.451 --> 00:14:02.952]  Her skin is flaking off in big cracks.
[00:14:04.613 --> 00:14:06.594]  You talk about brutal torture, this is it.
[00:14:06.634 --> 00:14:08.355]  But she's still responding.
[00:14:08.515 --> 00:14:10.216]  Still fighting.
[00:14:11.176 --> 00:14:14.018]  And I am just totally disgusted.
[00:14:15.623 --> 00:14:22.688]  Some people have been saying, why am I so concerned about this?
[00:14:22.708 --> 00:14:27.251]  150,000 Iraqis have died just since the liberation.
[00:14:28.032 --> 00:14:31.074]  Over a million in the 13 years of sanctions.
[00:14:31.814 --> 00:14:34.236]  We have 50 million abortions in this country.
[00:14:34.276 --> 00:14:38.759]  They're killing people by having their feeding tubes taken, who are openly begging for food and water.
[00:14:39.159 --> 00:14:41.521]  It's in regional papers every week.
[00:14:42.290 --> 00:14:43.850]  Why are we focusing so much on Terry?
[00:14:44.151 --> 00:14:52.713]  Because the globalists decided, the social architects decided, to make her a poster child for death.
[00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.974]  To redefine terms using Terry.
[00:14:57.374 --> 00:15:09.098]  Because she's a dear, sweet creature, who was, now I've got other affidavits and medical reports by doctors, do you know ten years ago they were able to get her up and help her that she could walk?
[00:15:10.512 --> 00:15:20.375]  A bunch of other affidavits about her eating, other affidavits about her talking, but anybody who doesn't get rehabilitation isn't going to get better.
[00:15:22.636 --> 00:15:24.557]  We already know the details of this.
[00:15:24.637 --> 00:15:29.539]  It's just so brutal to watch this happening and so painful.
[00:15:31.179 --> 00:15:35.121]  Terry went six and a half, seven days without water back in 2003.
[00:15:37.581 --> 00:15:41.403]  Perhaps he could come back now, but he'll never allow her to have rehabilitation.
[00:15:42.843 --> 00:15:49.386]  I would say, from the medical experts we've talked to, that it's irreparable what they've done to this young lady.
[00:15:50.947 --> 00:15:53.248]  They have tortured her just brutally.
[00:15:54.449 --> 00:15:55.629]  We'll get into it later.
[00:15:56.209 --> 00:16:01.752]  Right now, let's go to Bill in Ireland, in the Emerald Isle, I believe they call it.
[00:16:02.592 --> 00:16:03.232]  Welcome, Bill.
[00:16:03.252 --> 00:16:04.173]  Yes, thanks.
[00:16:05.798 --> 00:16:10.100]  I'd just like to say on the Terry Schieffer thing that I have two numbers for people to give out.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.481]  I mean, she is still conscious.
[00:16:12.082 --> 00:16:21.347]  Yesterday, from news reports I heard, she raised her arm to greet an old friend that came into the room to see her.
[00:16:21.708 --> 00:16:24.029]  She's definitely fighting hard.
[00:16:24.049 --> 00:16:25.850]  I mean, I think we should still try to save her.
[00:16:26.431 --> 00:16:31.734]  But 10, 11 days without water, it kills most people.
[00:16:32.475 --> 00:16:36.839]  Well, as you said, she was through this before, so she has inner strength.
[00:16:37.460 --> 00:16:42.926]  She was given Holy Communion, so she has spiritual strength too.
[00:16:43.226 --> 00:16:47.650]  I've gotten a lot of emails and personal friends have called me, and there have been historical cases of this.
[00:16:48.131 --> 00:16:50.413]  We should all pray for her and pray for a miracle.
[00:16:51.761 --> 00:17:12.306]  You know, but even if she stood up and started walking right now, even though she hasn't been allowed outside for five years, and haven't let them brush her teeth for ten years, and won't let them treat her bed sores for a decade, even if she stood up and started walking, they'd say, oh, well, this is just her nerves doing this.
[00:17:12.326 --> 00:17:13.246]  I mean, they'd spin it.
[00:17:13.966 --> 00:17:16.107]  Yes, but I think pressure still helps.
[00:17:17.287 --> 00:17:19.888]  I remember when I was driving around Los Angeles some years ago in 1993,
[00:17:21.144 --> 00:17:30.833]  Listen to Rush Limbaugh, he gave out the White House number and it was about the homosexuals in the army or whatever it was, the issue at that time.
[00:17:31.554 --> 00:17:34.777]  And people that Clinton wanted to bring up, or bring in.
[00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:38.440]  So everybody called the White House, millions of people.
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:44.146]  But have you noticed now that Bush is in and doing it, it's not a problem, now that Bush wants women in frontline combat, it's okay.
[00:17:45.717 --> 00:17:49.579]  Yeah, they've done away with the don't ask, don't tell thing, have they?
[00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:50.139]  Basically.
[00:17:50.339 --> 00:17:52.420]  Look, it's all window dressing, but go ahead.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:55.661]  Yeah, I just want to say, people should keep calling.
[00:17:55.681 --> 00:17:59.323]  This is the number for Jeb Bush, the governor of the Pontius Pilate of Florida.
[00:17:59.823 --> 00:17:59.983]  It's 850-488-2272.
[00:18:00.003 --> 00:18:01.084]  And let me give that to you again.
[00:18:01.104 --> 00:18:01.144]  850-488-2272.
[00:18:01.164 --> 00:18:05.046]  Everybody should ring, and it's going to be a busy line, but keep ringing.
[00:18:05.066 --> 00:18:05.606]  Keep that line tied up.
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.261]  You know, bring it to a standstill.
[00:18:18.281 --> 00:18:25.102]  The other number, when you're finished calling him, call the President, Bush, in the White House.
[00:18:25.162 --> 00:18:30.023]  His number is 202-456-1414.
[00:18:30.923 --> 00:18:31.683]  Alright, listen.
[00:18:32.123 --> 00:18:33.524]  Bill, I appreciate the call.
[00:18:34.124 --> 00:18:44.186]  Did you know two days ago, a little baby had his food and support taken away and died in Texas because Bush, before he left,
[00:18:44.804 --> 00:18:59.768]  One of his last actions was to pass this cost-saving measure, where when you're a ward of the state, or when you're having your medical care paid for by the state, they will take your feeding tube, take your support away.
[00:19:01.209 --> 00:19:11.372]  And why I think we should call for Terry Schindler, known as Shivo, we should also expose the fact that
[00:19:12.836 --> 00:19:20.122]  This is very hypocritical what Bush and others have done, and that all of these lives are just as valuable.
[00:19:21.302 --> 00:19:24.825]  When we come back, we'll talk to John and Johnny and James and Kenneth and many others.
[00:19:24.845 --> 00:19:26.066]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:26.106 --> 00:19:31.270]  And I'm going to go to your calls quickly, because I want to get everybody in here.
[00:19:32.731 --> 00:19:34.993]  We've got a big guest coming up in the second hour.
[00:19:37.074 --> 00:19:39.136]  But, I want to see people get as upset
[00:19:42.845 --> 00:19:46.589]  Next time I'm talking about somebody who's begging for food and water who can actually talk.
[00:19:47.630 --> 00:19:49.011]  Honey, can I please have some water?
[00:19:49.692 --> 00:19:50.592]  No, you're gonna die.
[00:19:50.632 --> 00:19:52.014]  The Bioethics Board says so.
[00:19:53.635 --> 00:19:56.038]  PrisonPlanet.tv is just one of the websites.
[00:19:56.618 --> 00:19:57.319]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:57.359 --> 00:19:57.759]  Stay with us.
[00:20:03.729 --> 00:20:09.234]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:20:09.635 --> 00:20:13.879]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:20:14.099 --> 00:20:21.146]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:20:21.526 --> 00:20:27.632]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:20:27.772 --> 00:20:28.993]  There are no side effects.
[00:20:29.313 --> 00:20:32.275]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:20:32.415 --> 00:20:34.456]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:20:34.756 --> 00:20:41.980]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:22:01.394 --> 00:22:05.297]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:22:05.517 --> 00:22:17.807]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:22:18.228 --> 00:22:18.628]  The U.S.
[00:22:18.668 --> 00:22:24.253]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:22:24.653 --> 00:22:26.855]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:22:28.716 --> 00:22:29.777]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:22:29.817 --> 00:22:32.658]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:22:32.778 --> 00:22:38.781]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:22:39.221 --> 00:22:42.563]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[00:23:00.851 --> 00:23:05.375]  Diabetics worldwide are experiencing tremendous success in lowering blood sugar and blood pressure.
[00:23:05.695 --> 00:23:09.719]  Attention diabetics and health conscious Americans, your body is starving for nutrients.
[00:23:10.079 --> 00:23:14.383]  And now there's an exciting new scientific breakthrough making inorganic vitamins and minerals obsolete.

[00:23:29.654 --> 00:23:30.814]  Sugarbalance.org.
[00:23:31.275 --> 00:23:31.775]  The U.S.
[00:23:31.975 --> 00:23:37.737]  9th District Court ruled that Food Matrix is better for maintaining vibrant health than our present inorganic vitamin and mineral supplements.
[00:23:38.098 --> 00:23:43.740]  The Nobel Prize winning science of Food Matrix has created an organic formula providing you the vital nutrients you need.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:48.702]  Diabetics worldwide are experiencing lower blood sugar and blood pressure, but it's not just for diabetics.
[00:23:49.062 --> 00:23:52.289]  Young and old can experience the power of Organic Food Matrix Supplements.

[00:24:13.869 --> 00:24:28.179]  I'll say this, the social architects thought that they would use the Terry Schindler case to train us to accept the torture and execution of people that are paralyzed.
[00:24:28.719 --> 00:24:30.220]  But it's going to blow up in their face.
[00:24:30.760 --> 00:24:43.629]  If Terry dies from the abuse they've been inflicting on her, if it continues much longer, she will be a martyr for the right to life and pro-life movement.
[00:24:44.398 --> 00:24:46.600]  John in Texas, thanks for holding, go ahead.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.340]  Hi Alex.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:48.901]  Can you hear me?
[00:24:48.981 --> 00:24:49.242]  Yes sir.
[00:24:50.062 --> 00:24:58.528]  You know, when the Romans used to nail a guy to the cross to crucify him, it wasn't a nail that killed him, it was the lack of food, water, and his organs were shut down.
[00:24:59.089 --> 00:25:01.390]  And it was a cruel death, and they knew it, that's why they did it.
[00:25:01.410 --> 00:25:04.132]  So it sort of looks like we're living in a new Rome, don't it?
[00:25:06.053 --> 00:25:09.976]  Well actually, what killed you was suffocation, generally.
[00:25:11.117 --> 00:25:12.238]  Because you couldn't support
[00:25:13.087 --> 00:25:40.326]  uh... your diaphragm because you were hanging by your arms and that's why people were still alive usually uh... after five or six hours the romans would break your legs because sometimes people could still partially support themselves and give their diaphragm purchase you know hold themselves up but uh... you're right it was a very cruel form of torture and it's ranked right up there with that as far as I'm concerned when they slowly start somebody up like that and uh...
[00:25:40.894 --> 00:25:42.375]  And it won't give them any kind of treatment or nothing.
[00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:43.976]  It ranks up there with crucifixion.
[00:25:44.196 --> 00:25:45.757]  No, you're absolutely right.
[00:25:45.997 --> 00:25:54.923]  And they use a very sophisticated, lawyer-like, semantical spin when they say, well, she's going to feel euphoria.
[00:25:55.543 --> 00:25:56.164]  And it's true.
[00:25:56.244 --> 00:26:03.969]  Right before you go into a coma, generally, from dehydration, you will feel euphoric for a few minutes, a few hours.
[00:26:04.049 --> 00:26:07.831]  But we're talking about days and weeks of torture before that.
[00:26:07.891 --> 00:26:09.012]  So it's all semantical.
[00:26:13.365 --> 00:26:19.888]  I know another trick that the Romans had was they used to take Christian babies and hang them from a long pole in the arena and let starving hyenas tear them apart.
[00:26:20.309 --> 00:26:24.991]  Well that's true, but the Christians were with Al Qaeda though.
[00:26:25.885 --> 00:26:27.065]  We had to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:27.425 --> 00:26:34.787]  But if you read what's been going on in these abortion clinics, with these partial birth abortions, especially where two-legged Irene is ripping them apart, I don't see any difference.
[00:26:34.847 --> 00:26:36.348]  I just don't like the way this country's going.
[00:26:36.668 --> 00:26:43.169]  Yep, hundreds of thousands of babies a year that could be adopted, no reason to kill them in the late third trimester.
[00:26:43.189 --> 00:26:44.169]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:26:44.249 --> 00:26:44.689]  I hear you.
[00:26:45.190 --> 00:26:46.290]  Johnny in Canada.
[00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:47.130]  Johnny, welcome.
[00:26:47.750 --> 00:26:48.510]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:26:48.650 --> 00:26:48.990]  Good, sir.
[00:26:49.791 --> 00:26:55.312]  I took a little vacation this weekend to visit some family for Easter, and I took a drive up the highway.
[00:26:55.876 --> 00:27:18.944]  up here in BC and what I saw was I don't know it was weird it was about 50 or 60 military probably Canadian trucks that were coming down the highway different times they had weird what they look like I don't know if they were Russian or Dutch flags flying from parts of the of the truck just like tied to them
[00:27:19.713 --> 00:27:20.994]  Kind of like a little flag.
[00:27:21.334 --> 00:27:32.161]  Well, there's always a lot of foreign troops doing maneuvers here in the United States, especially in the South and Southwest, but I don't know about what's going on up in Canada.
[00:27:32.621 --> 00:27:33.102]  Well, I don't know.
[00:27:33.142 --> 00:27:42.328]  I found it kind of weird until I saw a little something on resistancemanifesto.com, which talks about concentration camps, right?
[00:27:42.968 --> 00:27:48.572]  And on one of their little slideshow things, I see this enemy prisoner of war compound
[00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.292]  I don't know what that means.
[00:28:09.352 --> 00:28:10.213]  Hello there, Alex.
[00:28:10.593 --> 00:28:11.053]  Hello, sir.
[00:28:11.293 --> 00:28:12.274]  How we doing today?
[00:28:12.534 --> 00:28:15.756]  Doing a radio broadcast and talking to you, so I'm doing pretty good.
[00:28:15.976 --> 00:28:16.536]  Okie doke.
[00:28:17.197 --> 00:28:29.884]  I thought I'd heard over the weekend on one of the news broadcasts that Governor Bush, with his office, was taking any suggestions from anybody that had any ideas on what they could do.
[00:28:30.364 --> 00:28:31.565]  Well, that's true.
[00:28:32.706 --> 00:28:35.107]  Look, this is what happened over the weekend.
[00:28:36.485 --> 00:28:43.450]  Last week the Congress subpoenaed Terry and this little nothing judge said no.
[00:28:44.030 --> 00:28:44.871]  Which is ridiculous.
[00:28:46.636 --> 00:28:53.884]  Now, then the governor was going to send in the state police via abuse charges for an investigation, but didn't.
[00:28:54.405 --> 00:28:57.789]  The governor could do this if he wanted to, he isn't.
[00:28:57.849 --> 00:29:00.852]  He's just basically using it as a political set piece.
[00:29:01.373 --> 00:29:06.839]  Yeah, it might be interesting if he stuck somebody from his office on air just to see what they had to say.
[00:29:07.381 --> 00:29:08.622]  Well, they're pretty swamped.
[00:29:08.662 --> 00:29:12.063]  I'm told it's hard to even get through to the Governor's office, period.
[00:29:12.464 --> 00:29:14.084]  Much less get a spokesperson on.
[00:29:14.104 --> 00:29:21.248]  And one other question I had, a few years ago, this thing about Bill Clinton and the head of the U.N.
[00:29:21.448 --> 00:29:21.948]  had come up.
[00:29:22.368 --> 00:29:31.113]  And somewhere I heard that if the country sits on the Security Council, you can't have anybody from that country be in the head of the U.N.
[00:29:32.972 --> 00:29:36.713]  You know, I believe that's the case, but I'd have to check that out.
[00:29:36.913 --> 00:29:39.714]  Yeah, if I mentioned it, I'd heard that, and maybe you could check it out.
[00:29:40.134 --> 00:29:48.036]  I'm glad you raised that, because Bill Clinton says he wants to be Secretary General, and a lot of major publications say he's probably going to be the next person.
[00:29:48.076 --> 00:29:48.716]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.596 --> 00:29:52.497]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.977 --> 00:29:54.577]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.517 --> 00:29:58.198]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.698 --> 00:30:04.060]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:30:04.321 --> 00:30:08.165]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:30:08.485 --> 00:30:09.286]  Read the labels.
[00:30:09.726 --> 00:30:13.850]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:18.275]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:30:18.635 --> 00:30:23.520]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:27.482]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:30:27.662 --> 00:30:33.004]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:30:33.264 --> 00:30:36.005]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:30:36.305 --> 00:30:37.185]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:31:14.196 --> 00:31:18.718]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.

[00:31:30.706 --> 00:31:37.550]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.950 --> 00:31:40.092]  Your purified water is now ready!

[00:32:01.161 --> 00:32:04.062]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy.
[00:32:04.142 --> 00:32:06.683]  But never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:32:06.883 --> 00:32:13.745]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[00:32:14.565 --> 00:32:21.168]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:32:21.368 --> 00:32:22.708]  Now it's available to you.
[00:32:22.908 --> 00:32:29.491]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[00:32:29.711 --> 00:32:34.015]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[00:32:34.295 --> 00:32:40.560]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.

[00:33:24.031 --> 00:33:27.872]  Let's go straight back to the calls and talk to James in North Carolina.
[00:33:27.912 --> 00:33:28.592]  James, hello.
[00:33:28.912 --> 00:33:30.153]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:33:31.033 --> 00:33:32.093]  I'm doing all right, James.
[00:33:32.233 --> 00:33:37.275]  Yeah, but it makes it hard to do all right with hearing all this news.
[00:33:37.995 --> 00:33:51.199]  Um, my father had, uh, they didn't know if he had Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's, but he had to go to a rest home and they put him on feeding tubes and then
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:59.207]  Well, in a lot of cases, people are in bad shape, but then they get better about half the time.
[00:34:14.108 --> 00:34:21.111]  Even when they're elderly, if they have to go on a feeding tube, they build their strength back up and in many cases, you know, live another decade.
[00:34:21.572 --> 00:34:24.413]  Yeah, I mean, my father used to sit there and eat.
[00:34:24.453 --> 00:34:30.956]  Now, he wasn't like her, but he could sit in there and say, son, what did you have to eat today?
[00:34:30.976 --> 00:34:36.939]  Because his swallowing and esophagus couldn't work anymore, so we fed him on
[00:34:39.338 --> 00:34:41.540]  Well, that happens to a lot of people.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:48.448]  In fact, my grandfather on my mother's side and my grandmother on my father's side both had strokes.
[00:34:50.279 --> 00:34:54.861]  And they were both associated with having surgery, because that's how it always happens, blood clots.
[00:34:55.482 --> 00:34:58.403]  And they both had their throats paralyzed where they couldn't eat.
[00:34:58.843 --> 00:35:09.409]  And my grandmother went on trips all over the country, cooked food, I guess for about six, seven, eight years, longer than that, before she finally died.
[00:35:09.469 --> 00:35:14.752]  But according to these bioethicists, they'd have just go ahead and kill her, because her life isn't valuable.
[00:35:14.792 --> 00:35:15.352]  Thanks for the call.
[00:35:17.208 --> 00:35:19.108]  But she toughed it out for a long time.
[00:35:19.949 --> 00:35:31.651]  My grandfather, I guess he lived about five years after that happened, and he went from weighing about 250 pounds down to probably about 170.
[00:35:32.151 --> 00:35:33.771]  He never got really, really skinny.
[00:35:36.392 --> 00:35:40.033]  It wasn't fun, but he had a pretty good quality of life.
[00:35:40.353 --> 00:35:44.974]  The point is, you don't want to get the government involved in, oh, you have quality, you don't have quality.
[00:35:46.263 --> 00:35:48.685]  They're using the Terry Shadow Schindler case.
[00:35:49.786 --> 00:35:55.430]  We say Schindler, folks, because her husband has left her for ten years, has another wife, has children.
[00:35:56.011 --> 00:36:01.996]  Under any gauge of civil law, he has divorced her.
[00:36:02.196 --> 00:36:02.896]  He has left her.
[00:36:03.397 --> 00:36:04.157]  He has abandoned her.
[00:36:05.398 --> 00:36:07.400]  And, of course, I don't know if you know the story.
[00:36:07.460 --> 00:36:11.443]  Some people still that I talk to on the street, or who email me, don't know the story.
[00:36:11.483 --> 00:36:14.846]  He said he wanted to rehabilitate her until he got the settlement.
[00:36:16.258 --> 00:36:19.199]  $300,000 for himself and $700,000 for her.
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:24.102]  As soon as he got the settlement, he totally changed and said, no more treatment, no more nothing.
[00:36:24.142 --> 00:36:27.003]  When is that bitch going to die?
[00:36:27.043 --> 00:36:28.183]  That's from the affidavit.
[00:36:30.504 --> 00:36:36.247]  And she was responding very nicely to the treatment.
[00:36:37.047 --> 00:36:39.488]  To the rehabilitation.
[00:36:40.749 --> 00:36:42.970]  So, they're now redefining terms.
[00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:45.551]  And it's very, very scary.
[00:36:46.731 --> 00:36:50.236]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Dave in Wisconsin.
[00:36:50.256 --> 00:36:50.916]  Dave, welcome.
[00:36:51.557 --> 00:36:53.580]  Good day, anyway, Alex.
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.423]  I just wanted to bring up a couple things.
[00:36:56.503 --> 00:37:03.051]  I was down there at Pinellas Park for the last week, and I don't know if you knew that they had snipers on the roof.
[00:37:03.835 --> 00:37:29.936]  Well listen, I mean we've gone out and had land rights rallies, second amendment rallies and they've had SWAT teams, I mean I've been walking and seen the rifle aimed at my head and I start waving at them and you know the guys laugh at me and I'm just walking around you know wearing a t-shirt and blue jeans no weapons with a bullhorn
[00:37:31.094 --> 00:37:58.068]  But finally people did quote rush instead of one at a time being arrested with glasses of water yesterday and NPR did call it they said the violence escalated with the protesters implying that there had already been violence and then they went on to say when they rushed the police with glasses of water
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:04.004]  Well, that's not violent, but there they are again, semantically manipulating the words.
[00:38:04.684 --> 00:38:17.974]  Also, we were out there with a picture of Auschwitz, and we also brought up on the sign that it was P4, where they started with that secret program the Nazis did of starving children to death, disabled children.
[00:38:18.654 --> 00:38:19.475]  And the press
[00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:24.953]  We went out with a Nazi flag and the press pretty much ignored us, though, for the most part.
[00:38:25.174 --> 00:38:26.435]  They don't want to go that way.
[00:38:26.495 --> 00:38:28.577]  They don't want to compare it to Nazi Germany.
[00:38:30.198 --> 00:38:31.960]  Well, I've talked to other people that are there.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:45.011]  You'll have hundreds of people with anti-death signs, but the media, and I've seen it on the news and in AP and other snapshots, they will show the one or two signs that are for killing Terry.
[00:38:46.269 --> 00:38:53.293]  Yeah, I heard one person say that there was about an equal amount of protesters on both sides, which was totally untrue.
[00:38:53.313 --> 00:39:02.558]  The most I saw were six for killing Terry, and there was probably 200 to 300 on the other side at the time that she was saying this.
[00:39:03.819 --> 00:39:07.401]  Well, when you notice, the news doesn't like to show wide shots of the crowd.
[00:39:07.441 --> 00:39:08.601]  That's a trick they play.
[00:39:09.422 --> 00:39:13.324]  Since you raised Hitler, since you brought up Adolf Hitler,
[00:39:14.179 --> 00:39:25.146]  Shortly after being elected, the Nazi doctrine was kill the old, the infirm, the psychologically unclean.
[00:39:25.886 --> 00:39:28.688]  They called it racial sanitation.
[00:39:30.436 --> 00:39:51.327]  And the first person that they publicly killed, now the Nazis for two years after getting into office were killing most of the people in the hospitals, taking their food and water away, giving injections to people that were paralyzed even from the chest down if they weren't politically connected.
[00:39:52.325 --> 00:39:56.828]  This is part of the mainstream history books, but... Yeah, that was part of T4.
[00:39:56.928 --> 00:39:59.990]  It was secret to keep it from the German people for a long time.
[00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.810]  Exactly, until 1935.
[00:40:02.171 --> 00:40:04.072]  And just like with the Schiavo case...
[00:40:04.992 --> 00:40:10.533]  They picked a poster child, because they know that human beings interface on an individual basis.
[00:40:10.633 --> 00:40:15.734]  So, through the image of one person, it's easier for us to get a concept.
[00:40:15.834 --> 00:40:16.655]  Stalin said it.
[00:40:17.095 --> 00:40:19.355]  One person dies, it's a tragedy.
[00:40:20.075 --> 00:40:21.756]  Ten thousand die, it's a statistic.
[00:40:21.816 --> 00:40:31.358]  So, this family, who were high-level Nazis, wrote a letter to the Fuhrer that was published in newspapers and put in newsreels, and Hitler talked about it in the national speech.
[00:40:32.012 --> 00:40:40.494]  In 1935, when he then introduced this to the German people and went public, kind of the maiden voyage where they publicly launched it.
[00:40:41.634 --> 00:40:47.816]  And Hitler read the letter on the air, and I've read a copy of the letter, and it was, Our son is totally unhappy.
[00:40:48.516 --> 00:40:49.376]  He is an idiot.
[00:40:49.756 --> 00:40:51.217]  That was the term for being retarded.
[00:40:51.497 --> 00:40:52.477]  He was really autistic.
[00:40:53.659 --> 00:41:00.487]  And all he does is walk around, you know, in the woods and murmur and say the same thing over and over again.
[00:41:00.507 --> 00:41:13.762]  Oh please, Fuhrer, give us permission to kill him and rid the Reich of this, you know, of this... They use the same term that eugenics individuals used in this country.
[00:41:14.662 --> 00:41:17.503]  So, Hitler said, all right, you can kill him.
[00:41:18.123 --> 00:41:20.603]  And it was a loving, good thing that Fuhrer did.
[00:41:20.643 --> 00:41:22.504]  And it was all over Nazi news.
[00:41:23.224 --> 00:41:28.805]  And in America, Hitler was hailed by the eugenics crowd that runs Planned Parenthood today.
[00:41:28.865 --> 00:41:31.926]  Margaret Sanger got awards from Hitler, gave awards to Hitler.
[00:41:32.746 --> 00:41:33.426]  All of this.
[00:41:33.766 --> 00:41:35.487]  And so you're absolutely right.
[00:41:36.307 --> 00:41:38.987]  And then a few years later, they were basically killing everybody.
[00:41:39.007 --> 00:41:39.688]  Yep.
[00:41:40.108 --> 00:41:41.148]  And that's where we're headed.
[00:41:41.914 --> 00:41:44.076]  If people don't get out there and try to stop them.
[00:41:44.416 --> 00:41:49.399]  But notice they use these special cases to introduce it to the public.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:55.184]  Any other observations you made, Dave, while you were in Pinellas Park, Florida?
[00:41:55.424 --> 00:42:09.254]  Yeah, I would say that the crowd was very peaceful, and I actually, for when they're in their murdering of a person, I thought they should have been a little more vocal and raucous, even though the family would have been a little
[00:42:10.513 --> 00:42:14.356]  Because they claimed we were disturbing the other patients at that hospice.
[00:42:14.756 --> 00:42:19.140]  But, you know, people, if they love their family members, should get them out of that hospice.
[00:42:19.461 --> 00:42:23.224]  Are you saying family members of other people in the hospice or the Schindlers?
[00:42:23.344 --> 00:42:25.947]  Family members of both, as a matter of fact.
[00:42:26.067 --> 00:42:28.509]  One lady, her aunt had died.
[00:42:28.729 --> 00:42:31.472]  She said that we were upsetting other patients in there.
[00:42:32.193 --> 00:42:34.356]  Well, you know, that's not your problem.
[00:42:34.396 --> 00:42:37.622]  That's the problem of the people engaging in murder.
[00:42:38.884 --> 00:42:39.565]  Absolutely.
[00:42:39.605 --> 00:42:41.048]  Listen, I want to say this right now.
[00:42:42.316 --> 00:42:44.556]  I'm tired of all the word manipulation.
[00:42:44.577 --> 00:42:48.897]  I mean, that's the nature of what Eric Blair, known as George Orwell, wrote about in 1984.
[00:42:50.338 --> 00:42:53.198]  They call it, in the news, she's being given treatment.
[00:42:53.598 --> 00:42:57.139]  She's being given care in the hospice right now.
[00:42:58.039 --> 00:43:01.820]  They get on the news and say, we can't give her water because it might hurt her.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:05.981]  Folks, I've actually heard them say this on national news.
[00:43:06.661 --> 00:43:09.362]  They're changing all of these semantics around.
[00:43:09.382 --> 00:43:10.662]  It's a fraud.
[00:43:11.482 --> 00:43:13.203]  You're turning us into a deaf culture.
[00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.323]  Totally.
[00:43:14.663 --> 00:43:15.404]  They certainly are.
[00:43:15.444 --> 00:43:16.484]  Anything else, Soty?
[00:43:16.684 --> 00:43:17.485]  No, that would be all.
[00:43:17.525 --> 00:43:18.145]  Thank you very much.
[00:43:18.565 --> 00:43:19.506]  I have one last question.
[00:43:19.546 --> 00:43:23.467]  What prompted you to get in your car and drive down there from Wisconsin?
[00:43:24.188 --> 00:43:28.570]  Well, I looked at it myself and another pastor, as a matter of fact.
[00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:31.751]  We looked at it as kind of a watershed case.
[00:43:32.589 --> 00:43:36.891]  In that they want to, you know, basically get into the general public euthanasia.
[00:43:37.051 --> 00:43:37.531]  No, you're right.
[00:43:38.332 --> 00:43:40.673]  It's like Roe v. Wade.
[00:43:41.153 --> 00:43:52.278]  It's being introduced to us, and now the next time we hear about it, we won't be as upset, and it'll also give us this feeling of defeatism, this feeling of it can't be stopped.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:55.401]  That's right, and that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:43:55.441 --> 00:43:58.662]  They're going to shove it down our throats whether we like it or not.
[00:43:58.982 --> 00:44:05.765]  And if you watch the National News and the spin they're putting on it, like you say, they're euphoric when they're going without food and water.
[00:44:05.785 --> 00:44:09.206]  I mean, these idiots, I wish they'd go without food and water for a couple of days.
[00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:15.369]  Well, I fasted one time, just because it is healthy to do occasionally, for four days.
[00:44:17.526 --> 00:44:23.428]  Man, I did not enjoy it, but they say that not eating is nothing compared to not drinking.
[00:44:23.448 --> 00:44:24.088]  Thanks for the call.
[00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:28.110]  I really do appreciate that, and I appreciate you going down there.
[00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.930]  You did the right thing.
[00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.030]  God bless you, Dave.
[00:44:32.411 --> 00:44:35.252]  Now, they know exactly what they're doing with this case.
[00:44:36.412 --> 00:44:37.473]  John in Tennessee.
[00:44:37.553 --> 00:44:38.313]  John, go ahead.
[00:44:39.625 --> 00:44:55.014]  I have a question about Colonel Bogright filing affidavits of citizen's arrest against Michael Schiavo and Judge Greer but of course it did not succeed and Gritz was arrested for trying to bring water to Terry which serves no useful purpose.
[00:44:55.935 --> 00:45:02.318]  Now to make a citizen's arrest a person must make physical contact with the arrestee and take them into custody.
[00:45:03.179 --> 00:45:06.581]  But to file a legitimate criminal complaint and get the police to make an arrest
[00:45:07.432 --> 00:45:15.375]  It can only be filed with a judge in criminal court who holds an instant hearing on probable cause to determine if he should issue an arrest warrant.
[00:45:16.016 --> 00:45:20.177]  But Gritz filed his affidavit with the prosecutor and Governor Bush, so it had no effect.
[00:45:21.158 --> 00:45:32.722]  And my question is, as a military officer, Gritz is still in the Army Reserves, so is he an infiltrator that could subvert the arrest of... Well, his name is... he is Bo Gritz.
[00:45:34.677 --> 00:45:37.099]  Just so you know, it's not Grits.
[00:45:37.139 --> 00:45:38.540]  That's my take on it.
[00:45:39.681 --> 00:45:39.982]  Oh, okay.
[00:45:40.022 --> 00:45:40.522]  I understand.
[00:45:40.582 --> 00:45:41.863]  It's tongue-in-cheek.
[00:45:42.184 --> 00:45:46.727]  Was he sent to protect the massive insurance-reserved frauds in these medical death camps?
[00:45:47.528 --> 00:45:54.594]  And to protect Bush and protect the genocide of 7,000 Americans every day in bed now, practice, and aborticide?
[00:45:54.654 --> 00:45:56.295]  Or is he legitimate?
[00:45:56.696 --> 00:45:58.337]  John, you know what?
[00:45:59.964 --> 00:46:03.005]  I don't think Bo was down there for a bad reason.
[00:46:03.045 --> 00:46:10.127]  I think he was down there because he's legitimately concerned and I appreciate your call.
[00:46:10.507 --> 00:46:12.308]  Listen, I have nothing against Bo Grites.
[00:46:12.728 --> 00:46:21.651]  I got in a big fight with him on air one time when he was a guest because he's arrogant and he won't admit that he was wrong about what he said about patriots on CNN.
[00:46:23.452 --> 00:46:27.413]  But for those that don't know, remember the
[00:46:29.887 --> 00:46:37.131]  Teenager, or he was like a college student, 19 years old, who was bombing all over the Midwest.
[00:46:37.651 --> 00:46:41.753]  Little mailbox bombs that, thank God, didn't hurt anybody.
[00:46:42.453 --> 00:46:47.156]  And I looked at the bombs on TV, the map, and I said, that's almost a smiley face.
[00:46:48.437 --> 00:46:53.179]  And then listeners emailed and said, have you seen Fight Club with Tyler Durgan?
[00:46:54.011 --> 00:46:56.713]  Where they bomb the shape of smiley faces in buildings.
[00:46:56.753 --> 00:47:01.877]  And I said, yep, this is some young drug head who thinks he's part of Fight Club.
[00:47:03.878 --> 00:47:05.820]  And that is exactly what it was.
[00:47:05.880 --> 00:47:07.201]  And we're on record predicting that.
[00:47:07.541 --> 00:47:10.644]  Now we're on air saying what it is with basic criminology.
[00:47:10.944 --> 00:47:12.665]  Thanks to you, the listeners, for putting our heads together.
[00:47:13.366 --> 00:47:14.146]  That's what police do.
[00:47:14.186 --> 00:47:18.870]  They get a bunch of detectives in a room and brainstorm for, you know, ten hours around coffee.
[00:47:19.210 --> 00:47:20.091]  Well, that's what we did.
[00:47:20.631 --> 00:47:21.672]  We had the answer.
[00:47:22.239 --> 00:47:25.642]  When the government was sucking their thumbs and had no idea what was going on.
[00:47:26.123 --> 00:47:28.005]  Well, Bo gets up on CNN.
[00:47:29.767 --> 00:47:32.329]  This was like two or three years ago, so I forget all the details.
[00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:38.796]  But he gets up basically out of the video clip somewhere and says, well this is this right-wing, militia-type, black helicopter crowd.
[00:47:38.816 --> 00:47:39.957]  That's probably who's behind it.
[00:47:41.067 --> 00:47:43.888]  Now, that's pretty suspect, and I don't know why he said that.
[00:47:44.248 --> 00:47:47.790]  And then I got him up on the air and said he was wrong, and he said, no, I'm not wrong.
[00:47:48.210 --> 00:47:53.993]  So that's why I don't interview Bo, I don't, uh, you know, I don't, I don't, uh, I mean, it was bad.
[00:47:54.013 --> 00:47:59.055]  I mean, I've said stuff that's wrong before, nothing of that magnitude, but I'll say I'm wrong.
[00:47:59.755 --> 00:48:07.419]  But I don't want to sit here and say, Bo's some government agent, and he's bad, and... And this brings me into a whole other subject, and we'll go to Jim and others.
[00:48:09.275 --> 00:48:14.720]  I've heard people on the radio saying it's all a giant theatrical production.
[00:48:16.181 --> 00:48:19.444]  That this is all a staged event and the Schindlers are in on it.
[00:48:21.846 --> 00:48:23.327]  Folks, that is clearly not true.
[00:48:23.347 --> 00:48:25.829]  I've interviewed the Schindlers three, four years ago.
[00:48:27.610 --> 00:48:30.993]  You're right in the fact that you're saying that it's a theater.
[00:48:31.133 --> 00:48:34.256]  That the media has decided to focus in on this.
[00:48:35.157 --> 00:48:36.498]  But the Schindlers are good people.
[00:48:37.987 --> 00:48:42.131]  And I'm really, you know, my heart goes out to them, but this happens.
[00:48:44.653 --> 00:48:55.443]  Folks that are into the New World Order, into the Truth Movement, they get away from what they can prove, and they get off, so many times, quite frankly, into the absurd.
[00:48:57.685 --> 00:49:03.250]  And that's why some people don't listen to us, because they've heard so many kooks out there,
[00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:16.626]  Who just extrapolate and basically with the most tenuous fragments of tertiary capillary evidence, start extrapolating and making stuff up.
[00:49:18.967 --> 00:49:22.428]  When we've got just so many real things we can prove and focus in on.
[00:49:24.308 --> 00:49:29.690]  And really, for the people out there that are attacking the Schindlers now, give me a break.
[00:49:31.764 --> 00:49:34.866]  You really need to spend your time on better issues.
[00:49:35.566 --> 00:49:40.429]  There are so many real things that are unbelievable that are happening.
[00:49:41.629 --> 00:49:45.351]  Like that Cynthia McKinney clip we played from the House Armed Services Committee last week.
[00:49:45.891 --> 00:49:48.553]  In a Rumsfeld, government run white slavery rings.
[00:49:48.933 --> 00:49:51.094]  Trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[00:49:51.114 --> 00:49:52.235]  9-11 war games.
[00:49:52.275 --> 00:49:53.735]  I mean, this is real stuff.
[00:49:54.176 --> 00:49:56.057]  Cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:49:56.297 --> 00:49:56.617]  Real.
[00:49:59.306 --> 00:50:11.071]  Genetic engineering of most of the crops, the patenting of the food chain, just hundreds of real things that are happening.
[00:50:11.591 --> 00:50:15.973]  The free trade area of the Americas, national toll roads going in everywhere.
[00:50:17.334 --> 00:50:21.796]  So many people, when I tune into other radio shows, when I go to other, quote, patriot websites,
[00:50:22.853 --> 00:50:24.374]  They don't talk about that stuff.
[00:50:24.874 --> 00:50:31.298]  It's just all, this Patriot's bad, this Patriot's good, I like this person, I don't like that person.
[00:50:32.618 --> 00:50:37.781]  You know, why does Alex Jones do these radio interviews with mainstream talk show hosts?
[00:50:37.821 --> 00:50:38.502]  He's evil.
[00:50:39.462 --> 00:50:42.084]  No, I'm going into their territory.
[00:50:42.204 --> 00:50:46.286]  I'm engaging in information warfare.
[00:50:48.087 --> 00:50:50.008]  It's just mind-blowing.
[00:50:51.204 --> 00:50:55.405]  So come on, let's get our heads screwed on straight, and let's stick with the facts.
[00:50:55.846 --> 00:50:56.506]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.467 --> 00:51:02.968]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.168 --> 00:51:06.269]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.389 --> 00:51:10.290]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.350 --> 00:51:14.592]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.932 --> 00:51:18.693]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.833 --> 00:51:20.634]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.834 --> 00:51:24.157]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.177 --> 00:51:28.880]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.061 --> 00:51:32.103]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.283 --> 00:51:35.146]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.626 --> 00:51:41.751]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.271 --> 00:51:46.074]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:54:52.607 --> 00:54:55.869]  You know about Skull and Bones, that's only one chapter.
[00:54:57.746 --> 00:55:03.369]  One node, though it is a command ship, in this flotilla of evil.
[00:55:04.810 --> 00:55:12.174]  And we spend 35 minutes on the police state, the sound cannons, the secret arrests, the secret police taking photos, the surveillance blimps.

[00:55:27.566 --> 00:55:28.406]  Schwarzenegger.

[00:55:56.469 --> 00:55:57.929]  The wait is over.
[00:55:57.949 --> 00:55:59.109]  Marshall Law is shipping.
[00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:12.010]  Yes, Alex.
[00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:44.315]  On this, from a humanistic point of view, I agree with everything you say about this Schindler case.
[00:56:45.455 --> 00:56:49.199]  But, when you knock the judge on his decision, you're dead wrong.
[00:56:50.099 --> 00:56:55.124]  Because, some time ago, we were converted from people to a resource.
[00:56:56.181 --> 00:57:10.927]  Well, just because under Admiralty Law they've all declared us slave chattel of the state under a mercantile enterprise, doesn't mean that this parallel legal system they've built is the legitimate legal system.
[00:57:11.607 --> 00:57:12.748]  Well, that's what we ought to work on.
[00:57:12.768 --> 00:57:13.688]  Get rid of that.
[00:57:14.488 --> 00:57:20.531]  But until we do, and nobody griped, I didn't hear one talk show anywhere talk about being converted to a resource.
[00:57:21.528 --> 00:57:22.209]  Well, it's true.
[00:57:22.650 --> 00:57:27.036]  Your manager is called the Resource Manager, Human Resources.
[00:57:27.336 --> 00:57:27.817]  Absolutely.
[00:57:27.897 --> 00:57:31.282]  And under this whole bioethic system, they decide if you're a good resource.
[00:57:31.822 --> 00:57:35.027]  Now, as a resource, they can do anything to you they want to.
[00:57:35.047 --> 00:57:37.971]  A farmer that has a cow that's not productive, what's he do with it?
[00:57:39.488 --> 00:57:43.271]  Well, again, courts have said black people aren't human beings.
[00:57:43.311 --> 00:57:44.411]  We just don't follow that.
[00:57:44.712 --> 00:57:45.432]  That's a fraud.
[00:57:45.692 --> 00:57:49.255]  The courts can say none of us have rights and they decide if we're human.
[00:57:49.275 --> 00:57:50.576]  That's what the bioethics boards do.
[00:57:50.976 --> 00:57:51.777]  It's a fraud.
[00:57:52.097 --> 00:57:56.660]  We've all got to have our living wills clearly stating our rights.
[00:57:56.700 --> 00:57:57.360]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:57.841 --> 00:58:03.745]  But Governor Bush here in Texas, before he left office, made it clear the state, if they're paying for you, will kill you.
[00:58:04.525 --> 00:58:08.128]  And the so-called Christians don't want to talk about that.
[00:58:08.989 --> 00:58:10.410]  Let's talk to, who's up next here?
[00:58:12.350 --> 00:58:13.591]  Doug in Canada, go ahead.
[00:58:13.611 --> 00:58:14.571]  Hi Alex.
[00:58:14.951 --> 00:58:15.111]  Hello.
[00:58:15.131 --> 00:58:20.593]  Um, you know it takes a big man to back his words up, but it takes a bigger man to admit he was wrong and carry on.
[00:58:21.373 --> 00:58:31.517]  Um, yeah McKinnon, I, or McKinney, I think if more people like, um, if we had more people like her with a backbone, places of power, then we wouldn't be in the position we're in today.
[00:58:31.697 --> 00:58:32.937]  Have you seen that video clip?
[00:58:33.177 --> 00:58:33.418]  Yes.
[00:58:34.278 --> 00:58:36.018]  I've heard it many many times on the network here.
[00:58:36.038 --> 00:58:37.539]  That's just powerful.
[00:58:38.999 --> 00:58:40.100]  Well, I'll tell you what, stay there.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:45.406]  We'll talk about it when we get into the second hour here in 70 seconds.
[00:58:46.187 --> 00:58:48.349]  Then in about 10 minutes, we got a big guest coming on.
[00:58:51.592 --> 00:58:52.153]  Berkeywater.
[00:58:58.099 --> 00:58:58.780]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.401 --> 00:59:00.422]  Mainstream Media.
[00:59:01.147 --> 00:59:02.268]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.888 --> 00:59:03.749]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.489 --> 00:59:05.350]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.070 --> 00:59:09.972]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.232 --> 00:59:14.375]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.156 --> 00:59:21.379]  The essence of mind control is changing our values.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.942]  Changing and altering our world view to accept
[00:59:28.473 --> 00:59:31.434]  Having our private property taken without just compensation.
[00:59:33.155 --> 00:59:35.595]  Having our Bill of Rights and Constitution dismantled.
[00:59:35.615 --> 00:59:38.416]  Having torture promoted as a value.
[00:59:40.697 --> 00:59:44.639]  Conditioning the public to accept giving up our sovereignty for world government.
[00:59:45.539 --> 00:59:57.263]  We're going to be talking about that with the author of Torture and Truth, America Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror, Mark Danner, who's also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:59:58.351 --> 01:00:04.276]  We'll also get more into Terry Shivo Schindler, the earthquake yesterday, and the hundreds of dead.
[01:00:04.296 --> 01:00:06.217]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:06.298 --> 01:00:09.240]  Right now, going back to Doug in Canada.
[01:00:10.301 --> 01:00:14.184]  Doug, you were bringing up that Cynthia McKinney clip we played first last week.
[01:00:14.224 --> 01:00:15.105]  Now, others have aired it.
[01:00:16.826 --> 01:00:20.189]  It's posted on InfoWars.com, still on the main page today.
[01:00:21.531 --> 01:00:34.225]  And if you go to Infowars.com, you can watch it right there, where she brought up all these incredible issues to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and he was at a loss for words and looked quite shaken, did he not?
[01:00:34.706 --> 01:00:37.089]  It was actually very satisfying to see that.
[01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:40.172]  Just to watch them squirm in their seats.
[01:00:41.013 --> 01:00:41.353]  It was.
[01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:42.635]  Satisfying's a good word.
[01:00:43.822 --> 01:00:51.830]  The one thing, or the major thing I called in about, your call earlier talked about the guy in British Columbia seeing all the military transport trucks.
[01:00:52.931 --> 01:00:53.892]  That is going on here.
[01:00:54.012 --> 01:01:02.121]  They have admitted they're doing war games with the American military and the Mexican military as per last week's discussion with President Bush.
[01:01:02.987 --> 01:01:13.135]  Oh yeah, in fact it's been in the CBC, Canadians are upset about quote, giving up their sovereignty for the Union of American States through the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:01:13.655 --> 01:01:19.740]  And so the Mexicans in Canadian newspapers are talking about it, but the average American has no idea this is even going on.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:21.862]  Exactly, and it's really, really scary.
[01:01:21.962 --> 01:01:25.284]  Like in my city they're doing weather and chemical warfare here.
[01:01:25.685 --> 01:01:26.645]  You can see it in the skies.
[01:01:26.966 --> 01:01:29.968]  And I have the proof, but you can't tell anybody that because they don't believe you.
[01:01:31.058 --> 01:01:42.480]  Well, it's been in the Globe and Mail, it's been on the CBC that you've got this North Com drills with Mexican and Canadian and U.S.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.180]  troops up there.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:53.782]  It was even in one of your big papers a few months ago about state police from Texas up in British Columbia running checkpoints.
[01:01:54.382 --> 01:01:57.923]  It's really scary, and just one quick quote here that comes from our military.
[01:01:58.593 --> 01:02:02.516]  One minute you can be having coffee with someone, and the next you're gonna need to pull a gun.
[01:02:04.858 --> 01:02:05.999]  That pretty much sums it up there.
[01:02:06.279 --> 01:02:07.700]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[01:02:08.641 --> 01:02:14.846]  And again, terrorism is being used as the pretext to radically shift our entire society into a total police state.
[01:02:15.146 --> 01:02:24.833]  They tell you as a citizen you've got to give up all your liberties and allow your life to be under a microscope, but the borders, northern and southern, are more open than they've ever been.
[01:02:26.775 --> 01:02:27.495]  It's a fraud.
[01:02:27.555 --> 01:02:28.216]  It's a joke.
[01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:38.997]  And they engage in what they call acing, where people flying in from Middle Eastern countries don't even have to show their IDs coming off these international flights.
[01:02:39.678 --> 01:02:47.682]  You try to fly to see your grandma in Indiana, you're lucky if you don't get strip searched by some foreigner who can't even speak English.
[01:02:47.742 --> 01:02:48.322]  I'm not kidding!
[01:02:49.668 --> 01:02:57.234]  I got a report a few years ago at the Boston Logan Airport, 90% of the people working at the airport were not citizens.
[01:02:58.095 --> 01:03:00.136]  And something like 20% were illegal aliens.
[01:03:01.277 --> 01:03:03.299]  I mean, how do you get numbers like that?
[01:03:03.319 --> 01:03:05.600]  And I've been at these airports all over the country.
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:14.707]  Most of the time it's some foreigner, you know, who was just a few years ago shoving machine guns in people's backs, you know, in Bangladesh, and now they're doing it to you.
[01:03:16.128 --> 01:03:17.169]  It's amazing.
[01:03:17.189 --> 01:03:19.411]  All right, we've got a great guest coming up.
[01:03:20.572 --> 01:03:25.573]  Torture and Truth, America, Abu Ghraib, and the War on Terror by Mark Danner.
[01:03:26.754 --> 01:03:30.415]  And he writes for a bunch of different major publications like New Yorker Magazine, you name it.
[01:03:31.535 --> 01:03:33.195]  He'll be joining us after this quick break.
[01:03:34.476 --> 01:03:41.097]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and the websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:03:41.637 --> 01:03:42.978]  Please stay with us, we'll be right back.
[01:03:53.018 --> 01:03:57.940]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.522]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.682 --> 01:04:07.064]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.104 --> 01:04:08.445]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.225 --> 01:04:10.186]  Panama!
[01:04:10.226 --> 01:04:11.006]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:38.885 --> 01:04:39.526]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.169 --> 01:04:53.930]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:54.830]  Terrorism!
[01:04:54.930 --> 01:05:00.994]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:05:01.254 --> 01:05:02.855]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:05:03.095 --> 01:05:05.577]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.957 --> 01:05:20.526]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:20.566 --> 01:05:20.906]  government.
[01:05:21.066 --> 01:05:22.867]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:05:23.227 --> 01:05:29.131]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:29.291 --> 01:05:33.754]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[01:05:34.035 --> 01:05:39.438]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:39.538 --> 01:05:40.759]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.819 --> 01:05:41.100]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:43.461]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:05:53.417 --> 01:05:58.939]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:05:59.079 --> 01:06:00.159]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:06:00.279 --> 01:06:01.159]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:06:01.259 --> 01:06:04.100]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:09.162]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:06:09.402 --> 01:06:10.502]  Check out this new product.
[01:06:10.662 --> 01:06:11.782]  It's called No B.O.
[01:06:11.842 --> 01:06:13.523]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:06:13.923 --> 01:06:15.983]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[01:06:16.023 --> 01:06:17.584]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:06:17.824 --> 01:06:20.445]  Look, the creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.
[01:06:20.526 --> 01:06:25.348]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[01:06:25.628 --> 01:06:28.750]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[01:06:28.890 --> 01:06:34.273]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:06:34.373 --> 01:06:35.134]  Try No-BO.
[01:06:35.254 --> 01:06:36.234]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:06:37.415 --> 01:06:40.278]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[01:06:40.498 --> 01:06:43.381]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B-O.
[01:06:43.561 --> 01:06:46.063]  Check out their website at no-b-o.com.
[01:06:46.183 --> 01:06:51.268]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-B-O at no-b-o.com.
[01:06:53.811 --> 01:06:55.993]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.573 --> 01:06:59.376]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:03.271 --> 01:07:05.412]  Torture and Truth.
[01:07:06.133 --> 01:07:10.055]  America, Abu Ghraib, and the War on Terror by Mark Danner.
[01:07:11.776 --> 01:07:16.899]  And Mark, like many of our guests, has a gigantic bio.
[01:07:16.919 --> 01:07:23.603]  You can just link through at InfoWars.com to his website MarkDanner.com.
[01:07:23.643 --> 01:07:25.684]  Danner is D-A-N-N-E-R.
[01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:33.560]  And Mark Danner is a writer, journalist, and professor who has written for more than two decades on foreign affairs and international conflict.
[01:07:34.020 --> 01:07:47.647]  He has covered Central America, Haiti, the Balkans, and Iraq, among other stories, and has written extensively about the development of American foreign policy during the late Cold War and afterward, and about violations of human rights during that time.
[01:07:48.307 --> 01:07:52.189]  His book, Torture and Truth, is what we're about to be talking about.
[01:07:52.669 --> 01:08:14.098]  And he is also a member of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations with its 25, roughly 100 members, most of the most prestigious members of academia, banking and finance, government, entertainment, philosophy, you name it.
[01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:18.000]  And I do take Foreign Affairs, the bi-monthly publication,
[01:08:18.778 --> 01:08:25.820]  That I consider to basically be the CFR's propaganda, but they do have a diverse group of members.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:32.522]  I've had probably 20 CFR members on, actually more than that, over the years.
[01:08:33.462 --> 01:08:37.843]  It's great to have Mr. Danner on with us today.
[01:08:38.764 --> 01:08:40.384]  Mr. Danner, thank you for coming on with us.
[01:08:40.844 --> 01:08:41.564]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:41.624 --> 01:08:42.565]  Thank you for inviting me.
[01:08:43.085 --> 01:08:43.425]  You bet.
[01:08:44.955 --> 01:08:50.938]  How did you get into writing this book, Torture and Truth, America, Abu Ghraib, and the War on Terror?
[01:08:51.638 --> 01:08:54.119]  Because I've read the synopsis of it online.
[01:08:54.579 --> 01:08:59.001]  You basically, correct me if I'm wrong, point the finger and say, look, this stuff was ordered.
[01:08:59.021 --> 01:09:00.822]  Well, we have the Army's own documents, that's admitted.
[01:09:01.302 --> 01:09:03.603]  But still, the general public isn't aware of that.
[01:09:04.183 --> 01:09:09.005]  And then the other question is, are you popular at the CFR having these views?
[01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:12.667]  Because it seems the CFR right now is dominated by the neocons.
[01:09:14.267 --> 01:09:23.636]  Well, the first question, how I got involved in writing about it, I had been writing about Iraq and the Iraq War, and this was part of that.
[01:09:23.836 --> 01:09:31.804]  In fact, the images that were broadcast about a year ago now were enormously important in the war itself.
[01:09:32.545 --> 01:09:35.227]  They gave a very strong boost to the insurgency.
[01:09:37.063 --> 01:09:43.305]  Extremely useful to them in propaganda and so on and in recruiting members of the insurgency.
[01:09:43.745 --> 01:09:54.567]  So though we look at this as a domestic kind of scandal, it had a lot to do with the Iraq War and giving help to the insurgency in fighting the Americans.
[01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.568]  So that's the original, originally how I began writing about it.
[01:09:59.348 --> 01:10:06.470]  It soon became evident though that a lot of the documents that were being either released by the government
[01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:13.876]  Or leaked by the government, were extremely important, it seemed to me, for a public understanding of what exactly happened.
[01:10:14.656 --> 01:10:34.853]  This is one of those cases where if you actually look at the documents, if you look at the reports, you look at the depositions of those who were abused and tortured, you look at what the government itself has found to have happened at Abu Ghraib and also at other prisons, it isn't terribly controversial what went on there.
[01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:46.313]  What is controversy is the difference between what the government says happened and what was actually found out in these reports.
[01:10:46.413 --> 01:10:51.319]  So I felt very strongly that one had to try to bridge that gap.
[01:10:52.023 --> 01:11:01.768]  And so the book, Torture and Truth, includes not only my writing about what happened and the Iraq War itself, but the documents from the government that tell what happened.
[01:11:01.788 --> 01:11:02.929]  But let me stop you right there.
[01:11:02.989 --> 01:11:06.350]  By controversial, you mean, what happened there isn't being debated.
[01:11:07.251 --> 01:11:11.073]  Well, it's an interesting... Or do you mean it's not that big of a deal?
[01:11:11.093 --> 01:11:12.153]  Please clarify.
[01:11:12.433 --> 01:11:12.793]  No, no.
[01:11:12.873 --> 01:11:14.674]  I certainly think it is a very big deal.
[01:11:15.115 --> 01:11:19.837]  When I say controversial and not controversial, I mean that the effort... It's very transparent.
[01:11:21.063 --> 01:11:27.085]  It is transparent if you actually look at the investigations into what happened.
[01:11:27.145 --> 01:11:31.226]  But you'll never know what really happened if you watch the nightly news, because... That's right.
[01:11:31.806 --> 01:11:32.366]  That's right.
[01:11:32.506 --> 01:11:41.068]  Because the government responded to what happened by simply saying, you know, this was a few bad apples, which is the traditional
[01:11:42.027 --> 01:11:44.849]  response of governments who are accused of torture.
[01:11:45.129 --> 01:11:57.535]  The United Kingdom said that in the early seventies when there was a famous case in Northern Ireland and it's happened a number of times and the few bad apples defense is actually the way lawyers describe it.
[01:11:57.995 --> 01:12:00.137]  I like the analogy of cockroaches.
[01:12:01.017 --> 01:12:04.619]  We've already seen ten big fat cockroaches on the kitchen floor.
[01:12:04.979 --> 01:12:06.700]  There's probably a thousand in the walls.
[01:12:08.062 --> 01:12:12.187]  That's a homely metaphor that's very effective, I think.
[01:12:12.207 --> 01:12:14.129]  I mean, they claim, oh, it's just a few bad apples.
[01:12:14.190 --> 01:12:15.912]  No, this is just where they got caught.
[01:12:16.736 --> 01:12:18.957]  Yeah, I'm afraid that is the case.
[01:12:19.217 --> 01:12:21.818]  And, you know, increasingly this stuff has come out.
[01:12:22.258 --> 01:12:26.780]  We've essentially had revelations at the rate of a few a week.
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:34.563]  So the problem is, though, is the administration essentially counts on people not actually looking at the record.
[01:12:34.764 --> 01:12:36.584]  Psychological fatigue as well.
[01:12:36.604 --> 01:12:38.125]  They just get tired of hearing about it.
[01:12:38.465 --> 01:12:39.486]  I think that's very true.
[01:12:39.506 --> 01:12:40.587]  I think that's very true.
[01:12:40.647 --> 01:12:42.909]  It's a subject that people don't like to think about.
[01:12:43.349 --> 01:12:44.150]  It's shameful.
[01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:45.031]  It's unpleasant.
[01:12:45.651 --> 01:12:55.219]  And I think the administration believes that, you know, most people in the country would just as soon believe what the president says rather than look at things that might contradict what he says.
[01:12:55.319 --> 01:12:59.803]  Well, I want to get into your book that's got a lot of reviews for being very scholarly on the subject.
[01:12:59.903 --> 01:13:09.171]  I, myself, even made a film about it, so I'm up to speed and have basically all the declassified documents and official Army reports on it, as well as a cross-report.
[01:13:09.211 --> 01:13:14.635]  But I want to shift gears back to the CFR, which I would say is dominated by the neocons at this point.
[01:13:15.476 --> 01:13:17.898]  Are you popular there in the halls of the CFR?
[01:13:18.799 --> 01:13:20.881]  Well, so far as I know, I'm popular there.
[01:13:21.641 --> 01:13:27.142]  You know, as you and I discussed before, it's a very large organization.
[01:13:27.702 --> 01:13:37.225]  It's ideologically pretty diverse, so it's hard to say what particular strain it's dominated by.
[01:13:40.545 --> 01:13:42.046]  It's a membership organization.
[01:13:42.746 --> 01:13:48.067]  You essentially go to see people speak and see panel discussions and all the rest of it.
[01:13:48.767 --> 01:13:50.929]  And I find it very useful.
[01:13:50.949 --> 01:13:54.151]  I've been a member there for, I don't know, nearly 20 years now, I think.
[01:13:54.211 --> 01:14:03.337]  But isn't it really just a giant change agent group where they get the best minds involved and then kind of start co-opting people and seeing who will play ball?
[01:14:03.357 --> 01:14:12.143]  And by the dominant group being neocons, I mean that particular strain and strata of the CFR is in government right now.
[01:14:12.844 --> 01:14:16.106]  Well, you know, I think it's kind of a complicated issue.
[01:14:16.766 --> 01:14:17.587]  You know, the council
[01:14:18.388 --> 01:14:18.749]  I don't
[01:14:35.983 --> 01:14:42.825]  It's also true, though, depending on the ideology of the people who are in power, the council likes to be close to power.
[01:14:42.925 --> 01:14:52.707]  So if you have a government that's predominantly, as you say, neocon, the council will want to have high officials who share that ideology and who have access to power.
[01:14:53.087 --> 01:14:54.288]  And that has always happened.
[01:14:54.328 --> 01:14:58.469]  I don't think that's a particular ideological strain.
[01:14:58.489 --> 01:14:59.589]  What was the council founded for?
[01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:02.791]  What was the founding principles?
[01:15:02.851 --> 01:15:04.632]  And then we'll move on in the early 1920s.
[01:15:04.712 --> 01:15:17.220]  Yeah, it was founded essentially right in the aftermath, the immediate aftermath of World War I. It originally was this kind of think tank that was put together to help President Woodrow Wilson.
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.240]  League of Nations.
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:25.745]  In his preparation, well not just for the League, but generally his preparations for the Paris Conference and the Versailles Treaty.
[01:15:26.085 --> 01:15:28.827]  So it was kind of a think tank that was then made permanent
[01:15:29.487 --> 01:15:31.289]  Well, I don't want to spend all day on that.
[01:15:31.309 --> 01:15:33.731]  The listeners are very interested in the CFR because
[01:15:44.879 --> 01:15:55.788]  You know, they have people in there who kind of dissent from the predominant paradigm, but generally it's world government's good, world government's the answer, we've got to sacrifice our national sovereignty.
[01:15:56.128 --> 01:16:01.893]  Whether it's Republicans or Democrats, Strobe Talbot or George Bush Sr., we hear the same diatribe.
[01:16:02.253 --> 01:16:04.095]  Are you a supporter of world government?
[01:16:05.442 --> 01:16:12.126]  Well, you know, I can't help pointing out that the point you just made contradicts pretty dramatically the earlier point about neocons.
[01:16:12.146 --> 01:16:18.350]  It seems to me either it's neocon-sympathetic, as you argued a few minutes ago... What is against the Warren government?
[01:16:19.331 --> 01:16:24.794]  Well, as far as I can tell, the people in power, from Rumsfeld to Paul Wolfowitz and others... Bob Mueller?
[01:16:25.154 --> 01:16:27.877]  Certainly do not believe in world government.
[01:16:27.997 --> 01:16:31.141]  They don't believe in bolstering multilateral institutions.
[01:16:31.181 --> 01:16:39.910]  They've taken points of view, notably with the Iraq War, that have been flown in the face of UN decisions and UN feelings.
[01:16:40.110 --> 01:16:46.137]  But Mr. Diller, Professor, you know full well that that's all good cop, bad cop.
[01:16:47.774 --> 01:16:50.595]  I mean, you know Bush has actually been expanding the U.N.
[01:16:50.656 --> 01:16:55.138]  funding and signing on to treaties and going ahead with the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:16:56.618 --> 01:17:08.104]  Well, it's true that they certainly have different positions on trade, no question about it, but I think that their attitude toward the United Nations, with all due respect, is not good cop, bad cop.
[01:17:08.164 --> 01:17:09.665]  I mean, the decision that was made on Iraq
[01:17:10.946 --> 01:17:17.691]  was the strongest and most dramatic break with the United Nations and UN opinions that I can remember.
[01:17:17.871 --> 01:17:19.672]  And I don't think there was anything fake about it.
[01:17:20.233 --> 01:17:28.299]  I think the attitudes and the hurt feelings and the problems in relations, particularly with the European allies, are very real.
[01:17:28.599 --> 01:17:31.621]  And this was a real thing.
[01:17:31.701 --> 01:17:37.626]  And the fact that they have different views when it comes to trade policy doesn't contradict that central point.
[01:17:37.686 --> 01:17:38.787]  I mean, these issues are
[01:17:39.447 --> 01:17:42.268]  Obviously complicated, you know, there are a lot of different areas.
[01:17:42.368 --> 01:17:47.750]  Let me ask this, don't most members of the CFR believe in global government, global governance?
[01:17:48.610 --> 01:17:48.870]  No.
[01:17:49.951 --> 01:17:50.851]  No, I don't think they do.
[01:17:50.871 --> 01:18:03.095]  I would say, it depends what you mean by that, but I think, you know, you have a lot of people who are fairly mistrustful of the United Nations, and some who believe it should be strengthened.
[01:18:04.233 --> 01:18:07.114]  Opinion in the council is pretty divided.
[01:18:07.134 --> 01:18:12.054]  You know, you're talking about a lot of people with fairly diverse political views.
[01:18:12.374 --> 01:18:14.115]  Alright, well, fair enough.
[01:18:14.135 --> 01:18:31.898]  When we get back, I want to get back into torture and I want to specifically talk about the government documents and who gave the orders for this and just how much of this torture is really going on in light of the Red Sox jet being used to fly people around, you know, the private torture jets in England, the third-party countries,
[01:18:32.558 --> 01:18:36.241]  The Army's own report that 90% of those at the camps are totally innocent.
[01:18:36.921 --> 01:18:44.927]  I want to discuss this with you and also how television is promoting torture as the new virtue and people on the left like Alan Dershowitz.
[01:18:45.527 --> 01:18:46.668]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:47.929]  Stay with us, Mr. Danner.
[01:18:48.570 --> 01:18:49.851]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:18:55.046 --> 01:18:56.187]  All water isn't the same.
[01:18:56.467 --> 01:19:01.471]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:19:01.731 --> 01:19:04.333]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:19:04.533 --> 01:19:13.060]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.

[01:19:57.638 --> 01:19:58.679]  The real money folks.
[01:20:01.992 --> 01:20:03.913]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:20:04.414 --> 01:20:05.394]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:20:05.474 --> 01:20:06.675]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[01:20:06.795 --> 01:20:07.335]  A 5% increase.
[01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:10.357]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[01:20:10.377 --> 01:20:13.299]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:20:23.248 --> 01:20:25.330]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:28.892]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:20:29.493 --> 01:20:32.535]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[01:20:54.818 --> 01:20:59.320]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:03.762]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:21:04.062 --> 01:21:04.602]  We listened.
[01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:09.905]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:10.645]  We listened.
[01:21:11.025 --> 01:21:14.086]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:21:14.507 --> 01:21:15.027]  We listened.
[01:21:15.487 --> 01:21:19.529]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:21:20.109 --> 01:21:21.070]  We're good to go.
[01:21:45.391 --> 01:21:48.372]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[01:21:48.592 --> 01:21:52.553]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:53.233 --> 01:22:01.194]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:22:01.594 --> 01:22:02.855]  It suppresses your immune system.
[01:22:03.075 --> 01:22:03.755]  Now check this out.
[01:22:04.095 --> 01:22:07.536]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:22:07.836 --> 01:22:10.016]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[01:22:10.496 --> 01:22:13.137]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:22:14.437 --> 01:22:15.077]  It's that simple.
[01:22:15.417 --> 01:22:19.379]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[01:22:19.819 --> 01:22:27.821]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[01:22:58.399 --> 01:23:00.301]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:03.643]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:05.144 --> 01:23:07.286]  Coming up in the next segment, it's your chance
[01:23:08.234 --> 01:23:17.801]  Talk to Mr. Danner about his book, Torture and Truth, America, Abu Ghraib, and the War on Terror, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:23:17.861 --> 01:23:21.984]  There's a toll-free number to join us.
[01:23:22.604 --> 01:23:24.386]  Don, Mike, and others will be getting your calls.
[01:23:25.607 --> 01:23:37.115]  Continuing, Professor Danner, you talk about documents, and we've got the General's Report, we've got the other reports, 32 camps in Iraq,
[01:23:38.344 --> 01:23:46.147]  Camps where they take people in Egypt and in Jordan and in some of the Central Asian countries.
[01:23:46.547 --> 01:23:50.188]  Camp X-Ray, a CIA camp within a camp.
[01:23:51.489 --> 01:23:54.830]  Admittedly doing things to people we can't even mention on air.
[01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:56.651]  They're so horrible.
[01:23:57.451 --> 01:23:59.712]  I would imagine your book gets into that.
[01:24:00.626 --> 01:24:02.367]  Yes, it certainly does.
[01:24:02.627 --> 01:24:12.694]  It begins with the actual depositions from prisoners that were taken by the Army CID, Criminal Investigation Division, in Iraq.
[01:24:12.874 --> 01:24:16.856]  And I have the text of those depositions included in the book.
[01:24:17.657 --> 01:24:21.219]  It also includes the investigations that you spoke about.
[01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:29.965]  And all of these things together have a great number of accounts taken from, usually in judicial type settings, so under oath.
[01:24:30.552 --> 01:24:32.454]  Well, there's also the troops pleading guilty.
[01:24:47.231 --> 01:24:59.207]  But, you know, the important thing to say here, I think, is that these photographs came out and suggested that this stuff was Animal House on the night shift, which the former Secretary of Defense Schlesinger called it.
[01:24:59.247 --> 01:25:01.330]  That is, that it was sort of the late night doings.
[01:25:02.049 --> 01:25:02.149]  Okay.
[01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:26.324]  Well, Russ Limbaugh said that it was like a fraternity prank just blowing off steam.
[01:25:26.344 --> 01:25:33.530]  Sodomizing people with objects, putting acid on them, raping women, beating people to death.
[01:25:34.731 --> 01:25:38.193]  I mean, that's called murder and torture.
[01:25:38.894 --> 01:25:42.377]  And your book, according to the synopsis, according to the stuff I've researched,
[01:25:42.958 --> 01:25:44.640]  This leads right back to the White House.
[01:25:44.780 --> 01:25:51.429]  I remember Rumsfeld bragging on TV about how they were, quote, pressuring people severely.
[01:25:51.449 --> 01:25:54.814]  I remember Dershowitz calling for torture right after 9-11.
[01:25:56.102 --> 01:25:56.382]  Right.
[01:25:56.883 --> 01:26:07.308]  You know, you can see, and certainly the book shows this, that after 9-11 there was a pretty dramatic change right at the top of the government about the attitude toward interrogation.
[01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:11.631]  Decisions were made by the President and by other high officials.
[01:26:12.071 --> 01:26:19.395]  First of all, to withhold the protections of the Geneva Convention, and that debate was very vivid in the administration, but they finally decided
[01:26:20.215 --> 01:26:27.581]  For the first time in American history, not to grant Geneva Convention protection, and then to essentially redefine what torture is.
[01:26:27.601 --> 01:26:31.024]  The US, as you know, is committed not to torture.
[01:26:31.084 --> 01:26:36.389]  It's prohibited by our domestic laws, prohibited by international treaties to which we're signatory.
[01:26:37.389 --> 01:26:48.112]  There was a debate in the administration that finally resulted in a document that the Department of Justice wrote, which essentially said, you know, we may be prohibited from torturing, but what exactly is torture?
[01:26:48.132 --> 01:26:56.294]  And it defined torture... Well, yeah, Alberto Gonzales says if we torture somebody up until their organs fail and didn't mean to kill them, then it's not torture.
[01:26:56.394 --> 01:26:58.475]  And by the way, the President is the law.
[01:26:58.815 --> 01:26:59.895]  He's above the law.
[01:27:00.315 --> 01:27:01.456]  That's exactly right.
[01:27:01.476 --> 01:27:02.456]  He basically said
[01:27:03.016 --> 01:27:26.173]  Look, you know, for somebody to be tortured, they have to cause pain equivalent to major organ failure or death, which means that you can do an awful lot to people, like waterboarding, for example, which is submerging them underwater until they drown and then reviving them, which has been used by the CIA and apparently was explicitly approved by the Department of Justice for the CIA to use.
[01:27:26.958 --> 01:27:38.223]  And also, Mr. Dershowitz's example, which is inserting sterile needles under their fingernails, all of these things under the definition that the administration put together would not constitute torture.
[01:27:38.703 --> 01:27:43.685]  So, you know, you have a situation in which the President can say, well, no, no, we do not condone torture.
[01:27:44.245 --> 01:27:49.947]  But, when he uses that word, the administration has defined it in a way that most people would not accept.
[01:27:49.967 --> 01:27:50.788]  Depends on what is, is, is, is.
[01:27:51.088 --> 01:27:51.868]  Well, exactly.
[01:27:51.928 --> 01:27:53.469]  It's a verbal stratagem.
[01:27:54.069 --> 01:28:09.695]  And, you know, most people, if you describe waterboarding, which is, you know, you strip somebody down, you beat them up, you strap them to a board, and then you lower their head, usually upside down, into a tub of usually fetid, you know, dirty water, sometimes urine, something like that.
[01:28:10.456 --> 01:28:14.178]  Until they, essentially until they drown, then you revise them, then you do it again.
[01:28:14.198 --> 01:28:17.519]  Now, to most people, they would look at that and say, that's torture.
[01:28:17.579 --> 01:28:26.744]  Certainly, people in Argentina and Uruguay, where that was used extensively during the Dirty War, they called it the submarine, they would consider it torture.
[01:28:26.764 --> 01:28:31.586]  But under this definition, supposedly, you know, the administration can say, well, we don't torture.
[01:28:33.047 --> 01:28:34.948]  Yeah, it's like Terri Schiavo.
[01:28:35.069 --> 01:28:36.410]  It's like Terri Schiavo.
[01:28:36.450 --> 01:28:37.230]  We're not hurting her.
[01:28:37.250 --> 01:28:40.913]  We're just treating her by taking her water away.
[01:28:40.953 --> 01:28:41.734]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.076 --> 01:28:44.976]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.477 --> 01:28:47.078]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.979 --> 01:28:50.681]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.638 --> 01:28:59.159]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[01:28:59.359 --> 01:29:06.941]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[01:29:07.041 --> 01:29:15.223]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs, now is available to you.
[01:29:15.383 --> 01:29:21.965]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[01:29:22.185 --> 01:29:26.487]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diode therapy.
[01:29:26.767 --> 01:29:33.030]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.
[01:29:33.170 --> 01:29:37.232]  With over 12 different models to choose from, there's a Paynex 2000 device for everyone.

[01:29:53.658 --> 01:29:55.278]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.418 --> 01:29:59.519]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.659 --> 01:30:02.540]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.620 --> 01:30:09.341]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.521 --> 01:30:12.522]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.722 --> 01:30:15.122]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.242 --> 01:30:23.124]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:30:23.844 --> 01:30:34.731]  Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:34.871 --> 01:30:42.676]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:30:57.980 --> 01:31:00.761]  What America needs is affordable health insurance!
[01:31:01.601 --> 01:31:06.443]  Finding affordable health insurance for you and your family, it's on everybody's mind right now.
[01:31:06.463 --> 01:31:09.444]  And if you're self-employed, it's on your mind too.
[01:31:09.584 --> 01:31:14.585]  Well, I found a company you can call right now and get the affordable health insurance coverage you're looking for.
[01:31:14.705 --> 01:31:17.787]  The Midwest National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee.
[01:31:18.047 --> 01:31:18.967]  Write this number down.
[01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:19.927]  800-807-5989.
[01:31:21.988 --> 01:31:23.669]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:31:24.029 --> 01:31:37.354]  They specialize in helping entrepreneurs of all kinds and those of us who run small businesses or don't get health insurance where we work to protect our families with the health insurance we need.
[01:31:37.855 --> 01:31:41.876]  And if you have a COBRA plan that's about to expire, we can help you too.
[01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:43.417]  So call us right now.
[01:31:43.437 --> 01:31:43.697]  800-807-5989.
[01:31:43.757 --> 01:31:43.937]  That's 800-807-5989.
[01:31:49.279 --> 01:31:56.541]  Just to analyze what these creatures are doing, how they're trying to warp our psyche,
[01:32:14.269 --> 01:32:19.291]  Through fiction and through the mainstream media to accept torture, we're going to play this Limbaugh clip.
[01:32:19.952 --> 01:32:23.614]  And I found another clip that's even worse, saying, so what about torture?
[01:32:23.634 --> 01:32:29.096]  I still need to get that uploaded to the network computer, but we're going to play this Limbaugh clip.
[01:32:29.216 --> 01:32:30.737]  It's about 40 seconds long.
[01:32:31.177 --> 01:32:37.861]  Here in a second, go back to our guest, the author of Torture and Truth, America Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror.
[01:32:38.161 --> 01:32:40.702]  Then we'll talk to all the callers that are patiently holding.
[01:32:42.054 --> 01:32:50.996]  But before we do that, my new two and a half hour film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State, gets into torture.
[01:32:51.056 --> 01:33:10.320]  We show the Army reports, how most of the people, 90% were families, who didn't have their papers in order, taken to camps, children at the camps, women being raped in front of their husbands, doing things to people I can't mention here, large objects, acid, we'll just leave it at that.
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:13.040]  And this is what they admit.
[01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:16.922]  And Congress got thousands of photos and videos that the public never saw.
[01:33:17.582 --> 01:33:25.365]  CBS and kind of a psyops just released some of the lighter stuff and then, oh, dogs biting people and then sewing them up without deadening, that's just fine.
[01:33:26.285 --> 01:33:27.786]  This is only the tip of the iceberg.
[01:33:28.486 --> 01:33:31.948]  My new film, Martial Law, that's another one of the important things it covers.
[01:33:33.188 --> 01:33:34.809]  We show what really happened on 9-11.
[01:33:34.849 --> 01:33:37.910]  We show the sound wave cannons they're using in Iraq being used at the RNC.
[01:33:39.349 --> 01:33:43.610]  In New York, the secret police photographing the protesters, and even mainstream media.
[01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:45.591]  The hover blimps.
[01:33:46.731 --> 01:33:49.632]  The mindlessness of the delegates at the RNC.
[01:33:50.053 --> 01:33:53.874]  The mindlessness of the left, not even knowing what real issues are.
[01:33:54.774 --> 01:33:56.995]  It is such an important film, it's my best film.
[01:33:57.375 --> 01:34:00.596]  Go to nfowars.com to get Marshall Lobb.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:04.904]  Be on the safe, secure shopping cart to order your copy, your hard copy.
[01:34:05.184 --> 01:34:12.412]  You can watch clips of the film, read about it, order it, and other videos and books right there on the site at the bookstore and video store.
[01:34:13.073 --> 01:34:16.697]  Or call toll free to get Martial Law, now shipping for the last two weeks.
[01:34:16.717 --> 01:34:16.777]  1-888-253-3139
[01:34:24.819 --> 01:34:30.124]  888-253-3139 to call and order.
[01:34:30.164 --> 01:34:31.465]  They can answer your questions when you call.
[01:34:31.846 --> 01:34:35.409]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv where you can watch my weekly TV report.
[01:34:36.009 --> 01:34:44.357]  You can listen to my best radio interviews, all 12 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other videos and books we've been authorized to post.
[01:34:44.972 --> 01:34:48.093]  Fifteen cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:34:48.593 --> 01:34:49.994]  Fifteen cents a day.
[01:34:50.014 --> 01:34:51.794]  That just pays for the bandwidth.
[01:34:52.275 --> 01:34:54.235]  You can download and burn copies of the films.
[01:34:54.695 --> 01:34:58.177]  I just want to get the information out to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:34:58.997 --> 01:35:07.920]  Before I play this limbo clip, Professor Danner, tell us how we get your new book, Torture and Truth.
[01:35:09.045 --> 01:35:13.629]  Well, the book can be gotten through my website, markdanner.com.
[01:35:14.509 --> 01:35:27.959]  It can be ordered from Amazon and Barnes & Noble and other online suppliers, but of course what I would prefer is that people go to their local bookstore where the book should be in stock, and if it's not in stock, to ask for it.
[01:35:29.040 --> 01:35:33.566]  It's from New York Review Books, and it should be widely available.
[01:35:33.626 --> 01:35:38.092]  But if there's any problem in doing that, my website will get you right there very easily.
[01:35:38.192 --> 01:35:39.354]  MarkDanner.com.
[01:35:39.694 --> 01:35:39.995]  Okay.
[01:35:40.535 --> 01:35:46.964]  Now, I want to go to calls here, but first I want to talk about the hardening of the psyche and how they're selling us on this evil.
[01:35:47.524 --> 01:35:55.429]  Every cop show, every major drama, and then in the real world, all the big editorials, it's the same MO, the same talking points.
[01:35:55.449 --> 01:36:01.994]  We now have mainstream news reports that Homeland Security's even paying off an advising threat matrix 24.
[01:36:02.854 --> 01:36:08.078]  These shows where they now torture people's children almost every episode to make them talk.
[01:36:08.418 --> 01:36:15.343]  Now torturing children is good, so I guess Joseph Mingala wasn't bad, but here's Rush Limbaugh as the change agent
[01:36:15.951 --> 01:36:21.040]  Telling his audience that it's just blowing off steam, the torture is no big deal.
[01:36:21.281 --> 01:36:22.022]  Here is that clip.
[01:36:23.288 --> 01:36:24.949]  What's psychologically wrong with that?
[01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:32.516]  It's not the act so much, it was like a college fraternity prank to stack up naked men and women.
[01:36:32.536 --> 01:36:32.916]  Exactly!
[01:36:33.217 --> 01:36:34.878]  Exactly my point!
[01:36:35.198 --> 01:36:46.028]  This is no different than what happens at the Skull and Bones initiation, and we're going to ruin people's lives with it, and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we're going to really hammer them because they had a good time.
[01:36:49.128 --> 01:36:51.230]  These people are being fired at every day.
[01:36:51.290 --> 01:36:52.751]  I'm talking about the people having a good time.
[01:36:53.091 --> 01:36:55.553]  These people... You ever heard of emotional release?
[01:36:56.614 --> 01:36:58.555]  You ever heard of needing to blow some steam off?
[01:37:00.256 --> 01:37:04.760]  So, there's the clip, and others have called for outright torturing them.
[01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:11.604]  I've heard it on talk radio saying it's good, but Alan Dershowitz is off calling it a great American value.
[01:37:12.645 --> 01:37:16.188]  Truly, we see the attempt to mass-warp the psyche
[01:37:17.234 --> 01:37:32.468]  And then people accept that torture isn't torture, and then we hear reports of a guy's chained down in a hospital bed, he won't give a urine sample on demand, so they taser him, and the police just go, this is our new policy, it isn't torture, it's just pressure.
[01:37:33.189 --> 01:37:33.569]  Professor?
[01:37:34.597 --> 01:37:39.200]  Well, I'm very glad you played the quote from Russ Limbaugh.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:43.402]  I think basically what it shows is ignorance, first of all.
[01:37:43.823 --> 01:37:48.145]  I mean, what he describes as fraternity hazing, that's just not the case.
[01:37:48.165 --> 01:37:50.067]  This stuff went on for days and days.
[01:37:50.387 --> 01:37:51.788]  It was highly organized.
[01:37:52.248 --> 01:37:54.850]  It began with beatings, extensive beatings.
[01:37:54.930 --> 01:37:59.953]  People were beaten into unconsciousness in a fairly systematic way.
[01:38:00.793 --> 01:38:03.475]  People were injured in such a way they had to go to the hospital.
[01:38:04.490 --> 01:38:07.717]  Uh, they were bitten very severely on their legs by dogs.
[01:38:08.398 --> 01:38:10.343]  One man's ear was nearly torn off.
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:19.385]  People were beaten to death, then they'd pack ice on them, put a fake IV on them, and take them out the front door.
[01:38:19.785 --> 01:38:20.405]  That's right.
[01:38:20.786 --> 01:38:34.555]  At this point, the army has officially admitted, the American military, I should say, has officially admitted that 27 detainees have died under interrogation, and these are the detainees that those are considered homicides.
[01:38:35.415 --> 01:38:40.298]  The total number of deaths in detainment situations now is over 70.
[01:38:40.698 --> 01:38:43.100]  Now let's be clear, that's what they admit.
[01:38:43.120 --> 01:38:51.805]  There's 32 camps in Iraq, a dozen in Afghanistan, two camps at Guantanamo Bay, and camps in at least five other third-party countries.
[01:38:52.265 --> 01:39:06.217]  Did you see the Washington Post article in late 2001 where they have the CIA section chief over the Middle East as quoted as saying, we take them to Egypt and Jordan where we can torture them and pressure their families in front of them?
[01:39:07.298 --> 01:39:08.178]  Yeah, I did see that.
[01:39:08.198 --> 01:39:10.841]  I think that was 2002, but yes, I did see it.
[01:39:10.941 --> 01:39:11.521]  Okay, early 2002.
[01:39:11.561 --> 01:39:12.262]  I've got it in the film.
[01:39:13.012 --> 01:39:13.793]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:39:13.893 --> 01:39:19.699]  Well, you know, a lot of this stuff is on the record, you know, which is one of the points of my book, Torture and Treatment.
[01:39:19.719 --> 01:39:22.021]  But it's not torture if we don't kill them on purpose.
[01:39:22.902 --> 01:39:26.226]  Yes, that's right, if they're killed accidentally.
[01:39:26.646 --> 01:39:32.132]  So if I go up and beat somebody with a baseball bat and didn't mean to kill them, I can just say I was blowing off steam to the cops?
[01:39:32.927 --> 01:39:42.210]  Well, under their definition of torture, if your main point is not to cause extensive pain, then in fact it's not torture.
[01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:43.830]  That's under their definition.
[01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:48.451]  But I think the important thing to underline about what Mr. Limbaugh said is that it's simply not true.
[01:39:48.471 --> 01:39:49.772]  It's factually wrong.
[01:39:49.832 --> 01:39:52.213]  It's not a question of how he's interpreting things.
[01:39:52.653 --> 01:39:55.253]  He's got it wrong what actually happened.
[01:39:55.673 --> 01:39:57.114]  And we know what actually happened.
[01:39:57.134 --> 01:39:58.294]  The documents have come out.
[01:39:58.334 --> 01:39:59.154]  You can read them.
[01:39:59.515 --> 01:40:00.755]  They're there in black and white.
[01:40:01.295 --> 01:40:05.880]  And, you know, he relies on the fact that nobody is going to read anything that they're just going to listen to him.
[01:40:07.001 --> 01:40:11.305]  And so he can say this and basically say things that are absolutely contrary.
[01:40:11.325 --> 01:40:16.770]  Well, yeah, I've heard him say that Bush is not for amnesty when Bush has openly said he's for open borders and amnesty.
[01:40:17.131 --> 01:40:21.375]  Yeah, well, he does and there is a certain technique here which is simply to tell people
[01:40:22.315 --> 01:40:28.419]  A story that seems to fit together itself and to count on the fact that they're not going to check it and you essentially tell them what they want to hear.
[01:40:28.439 --> 01:40:39.387]  Well, I'm blown away by these people because, Professor, all I do is read government documents and what is admitted and I'm telling you, the liberals, the conservatives, they're all up there together basically for all this stuff and they're all a bunch of liars.
[01:40:40.287 --> 01:40:46.790]  Well, I think it's true that, you know, there is a lot of lying going on on these things, there's no question.
[01:40:46.810 --> 01:40:57.214]  I think it's also true that a lot of this stuff is coming out, that the documentary evidence is coming out, and that increasingly, you know, the truth is getting into the public sphere.
[01:40:57.314 --> 01:40:59.795]  So I wouldn't lose hope on this.
[01:40:59.975 --> 01:41:02.496]  It's just that, you know, it's taking a long time to get out.
[01:41:02.976 --> 01:41:04.298]  And to change people's opinion.
[01:41:04.338 --> 01:41:05.800]  But I think it will happen.
[01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.403]  I think we're heading in that direction.
[01:41:08.583 --> 01:41:11.366]  Clearly, Professor, there is an agenda.
[01:41:11.426 --> 01:41:15.471]  Homeland Security head Reg and now Chertoff have met with the media
[01:41:16.681 --> 01:41:20.484]  They're consulting, and we've got all these paid-for press releases.
[01:41:21.645 --> 01:41:27.810]  We know that they are literally writing some of the scripts, we've read these articles on air, for these TV shows.
[01:41:27.850 --> 01:41:35.717]  Every time I turn it on, they're now not just torturing the, quote, terrorists on these fiction shows, they're torturing seven, eight-year-old children.
[01:41:36.457 --> 01:41:39.700]  And this is a concerted effort to warp our minds.
[01:41:40.988 --> 01:41:43.510]  Yes, well, I think that's true.
[01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:49.513]  I don't know, but I'll take your word for it, the degree of administration involvement and consulting on these scripts.
[01:41:50.454 --> 01:42:05.283]  It's also true, you know, that when people feel anxiety about their safety, when people are bewildered about why the country's been attacked and so on, you get the mass media, and in particular the commercial media, television,
[01:42:05.943 --> 01:42:06.564]  Yes, I think so.
[01:42:21.639 --> 01:42:26.242]  Uh, that's worried about being attacked and showing them, uh, justice being delivered.
[01:42:26.302 --> 01:42:27.983]  And I think there's a lot of that going on.
[01:42:28.043 --> 01:42:39.470]  But what people don't understand is, is that cops now, since they've been doing this the last three years, suddenly instances of torture by the police, uh, against innocent people is way up.
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:44.583]  There aren't real Al-Ci-8-us folks running around that are going to get us.
[01:42:45.444 --> 01:42:53.289]  Terrorism is actually at lows, child kidnappings at lows, crime is at lows right now, all-time lows.
[01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:57.892]  It is this perception, and torture isn't going to keep you safe.
[01:42:58.192 --> 01:43:03.696]  Listen, I want to go to calls, but I've just got one other comment, and then I want you to comment on it, Professor.
[01:43:03.716 --> 01:43:08.119]  We're talking to Mark Danner, author of this new book, Torture and Truth.
[01:43:10.422 --> 01:43:21.229]  The types of sexual perversion at Abu Ghraib and Camp X-Ray, admittedly associated with this, the types of things they're doing, I've only seen this with serial killers.
[01:43:21.629 --> 01:43:26.933]  So even if sickos out there go, we gotta torture them to get answers, why is it all sexually perverted?
[01:43:27.822 --> 01:43:40.364]  Well, I think that there's a perception that one of the areas of sensitivity when it comes to Middle Eastern, particularly Arab culture, is shame about sexual matters, and in particular, shame about nudity.
[01:43:40.964 --> 01:43:54.507]  And you can see, pervasively, if you look at what's happened to individual people, not only in Abu Ghraib, but there are instances where journalists, Arab journalists... Yeah, but these guards are raping women in front of the men because they like it.
[01:43:55.450 --> 01:43:58.733]  Well, Dave, I don't dispute that some of them may like it.
[01:43:58.773 --> 01:44:00.314]  It's a tough job, but I gotta do it!
[01:44:00.354 --> 01:44:11.883]  I'm trying to answer your question, which is that it seems to me that a lot of this stuff is systemic, and it's trying to point to particular sensitivities, cultural sensitivities, on the part of Arab men.
[01:44:11.943 --> 01:44:24.372]  The fact that it's very unusual and indeed forbidden for men to see one another naked in Arab culture, things having to do with, you know, bathroom stuff and so on is done very secretively.
[01:44:25.813 --> 01:44:36.256]  It's very private, and you can tell in the way these torture procedures operate that there's been a clear study of the sensitivities of Arab culture.
[01:44:36.316 --> 01:44:43.137]  No, I agree with you, but then the feds also go and they hire former prison guards with bad records who enjoy doing this.
[01:44:45.978 --> 01:44:49.979]  Yes, there's no question that some of these people clearly were enjoying themselves.
[01:44:50.419 --> 01:44:51.019]  You can see it.
[01:44:52.059 --> 01:44:54.200]  In beating people to death and raping people.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:54.900]  Folks, come on.
[01:44:55.932 --> 01:44:57.693]  Let's take some calls.
[01:44:58.053 --> 01:44:59.193]  Don in Missouri.
[01:44:59.233 --> 01:44:59.993]  Don, you're on the air.
[01:45:00.013 --> 01:45:00.574]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:00.934 --> 01:45:01.614]  Yeah, I agree.
[01:45:01.654 --> 01:45:02.774]  I think it's all one cloth.
[01:45:03.795 --> 01:45:07.256]  Listen, I wanted to touch upon the Schiavo case again.
[01:45:07.276 --> 01:45:18.299]  You know, I haven't been able to listen the last week or so, so I don't know if you've explored this already, but this behavior of Michael Schiavo is just so bizarre, and all these powerful people covering up for him.
[01:45:19.019 --> 01:45:24.701]  The only explanation I can come up for it is that since Florida's crawling with CIA agents, that maybe he's an agent.
[01:45:25.279 --> 01:45:26.520]  And Terry was his slave.
[01:45:27.261 --> 01:45:32.667]  And now the government is caught in this public relations nightmare and they're scrambling to try to...
[01:45:33.547 --> 01:45:36.509]  We're willing to kill her in public just to cover this up.
[01:46:04.288 --> 01:46:05.129]  Yeah, it's true.
[01:46:05.749 --> 01:46:12.215]  People, certainly it's been in the press, that law that then-Governor Bush passed.
[01:46:12.275 --> 01:46:15.098]  I just killed a little baby two days ago, by the way, but go ahead.
[01:46:15.118 --> 01:46:17.761]  Yes, yes, I saw that in the news.
[01:46:18.161 --> 01:46:27.430]  And there's clearly a very high degree of contradiction here between what people say and the political positions they take, particularly in the Shivo case, and what they've actually done.
[01:46:28.047 --> 01:46:49.206]  uh... in their political history and in their own lives for that matter when it comes to Tom DeLay for example uh... so uh... we see those contradictions very dramatically and it shows in this case a lot of politicians are looking at it simply as a lucrative political target you know this is going to help me firm up my uh... position uh... with the evangelical right uh... and the left likes it too.
[01:46:49.266 --> 01:46:54.891]  Mike in Washington you're on the air go ahead yeah speaking of contradictions you know we got this uh...
[01:46:55.516 --> 01:47:12.075]  I saw that clip of that slimeball Jack Wheeler from the Freedom Foundation saying how we should freeze everyone's lungs and then when they're about ready to die then we'll make them breathe again.
[01:47:12.837 --> 01:47:15.678]  You know, that's basically high-tech tabling.
[01:47:16.599 --> 01:47:22.522]  I've actually got that clip in Police States for Total Enslavement where they're on national TV saying how good torture is.
[01:47:22.602 --> 01:47:27.104]  Exactly, and it's just trying to... it's just justifying everything.
[01:47:28.764 --> 01:47:36.908]  But another reason I want to talk to you, Alex, is that I'm sure you're familiar with the 1997 Act where Queen Elizabeth
[01:47:42.208 --> 01:47:46.230]  Um, where she, uh, enhanced the, uh, Social Security?
[01:47:48.931 --> 01:47:49.832]  I'm not reading you.
[01:47:49.932 --> 01:47:50.912]  I'm not, I'm not understanding.
[01:47:51.132 --> 01:47:55.734]  Well, there was, uh, uh, it was, uh, oh, what's it called?
[01:47:56.135 --> 01:47:56.555]  Uh, yeah.
[01:47:57.595 --> 01:47:58.556]  I really don't know, sir.
[01:47:59.216 --> 01:48:00.697]  Queen Elizabeth Social Security.
[01:48:00.937 --> 01:48:01.277]  Yeah.
[01:48:01.597 --> 01:48:09.661]  Uh, well, um, in 1997, they did a, uh, there was a, uh, in, uh, in England,
[01:48:10.356 --> 01:48:12.477]  Queen Elizabeth controls and amended the U.S.
[01:48:12.497 --> 01:48:16.279]  Social Security under 1997 number 1778.
[01:48:17.480 --> 01:48:18.921]  I wasn't aware of that.
[01:48:18.941 --> 01:48:21.382]  You'll have to send me some information on that now.
[01:48:21.743 --> 01:48:25.745]  Oh yeah, Queen Elizabeth amended our Social Security back in 1997.
[01:48:25.865 --> 01:48:28.386]  Well, you'll have to send me some information on that, Mike.
[01:48:28.867 --> 01:48:31.368]  And it's all over the web.
[01:48:31.608 --> 01:48:31.949]  Really?
[01:48:32.069 --> 01:48:36.091]  Yeah, and it pretty much just points out that we're basically
[01:48:37.102 --> 01:48:38.862]  Run by England.
[01:48:39.162 --> 01:48:39.542]  I hear you.
[01:48:39.562 --> 01:48:40.203]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:40.943 --> 01:48:42.383]  Let's talk to Eric in Oklahoma.
[01:48:42.423 --> 01:48:43.183]  Eric, you're on the air.
[01:48:43.223 --> 01:48:43.603]  Go ahead.
[01:48:43.763 --> 01:48:44.563]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:44.643 --> 01:48:45.283]  How are you doing?
[01:48:45.443 --> 01:48:45.584]  Good.
[01:48:45.704 --> 01:48:46.284]  Doing a talk show.
[01:48:46.304 --> 01:48:46.804]  What's on your mind?
[01:48:47.124 --> 01:48:50.064]  I listen to Mark a lot.
[01:48:50.144 --> 01:48:54.325]  He's one of the few intellectually honest people that I've heard on the media.
[01:48:54.545 --> 01:48:59.706]  I look at everything through the eyes of dialectical materialism.
[01:48:59.786 --> 01:49:01.606]  Everything is so dialectic these days.
[01:49:02.066 --> 01:49:04.187]  There's the pro, the con, the right, the left.
[01:49:05.808 --> 01:49:10.550]  Lately, it seems like instead of just left and right, it's like a pinwheel.
[01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:14.251]  People take a position and then it's being spun.
[01:49:14.931 --> 01:49:17.772]  So, it's no longer about the right or left.
[01:49:17.792 --> 01:49:19.213]  It's really about right and wrong.
[01:49:19.393 --> 01:49:22.934]  And they're trying to blur the distinctions between right and wrong.
[01:49:23.554 --> 01:49:25.075]  Well, that's what change agents do.
[01:49:25.095 --> 01:49:28.976]  That's what MKUltra was about, was how to change the views of Americans.
[01:49:29.356 --> 01:49:31.037]  That's right, and that's why we're in trouble.
[01:49:31.057 --> 01:49:32.317]  Stay there, Eric.
[01:49:32.337 --> 01:49:33.978]  We'll come back and let the professor
[01:49:34.671 --> 01:49:36.853]  Comment on your statement.
[01:49:37.294 --> 01:49:38.515]  Let you finish up as well.
[01:49:39.176 --> 01:49:42.158]  Final segment with a professor coming up in the third hour.
[01:49:42.579 --> 01:49:44.761]  A ton of news and wide open telephones.
[01:49:45.522 --> 01:49:46.723]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:49:46.863 --> 01:49:50.807]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[01:49:53.985 --> 01:50:00.831]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.152 --> 01:50:02.513]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.713 --> 01:50:04.935]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.075 --> 01:50:07.157]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.437 --> 01:50:12.382]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.722 --> 01:50:16.766]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.986 --> 01:50:18.768]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.848 --> 01:50:29.480]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:31.523]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:50:53.544 --> 01:50:58.749]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.909 --> 01:51:06.996]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.256 --> 01:51:14.302]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.482 --> 01:51:15.402]  We're good to go!

[01:53:01.624 --> 01:53:05.486]  Rumsfeld gets up on TV and says, I never said there were weapons of mass destruction.
[01:53:05.526 --> 01:53:07.246]  It's a conspiracy theory and urban legend.
[01:53:09.507 --> 01:53:11.268]  And now they say they never called for torture.
[01:53:11.388 --> 01:53:16.750]  It isn't torture if we beat and brutalize and drown somebody until they die.
[01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:17.791]  We didn't mean to kill them.
[01:53:19.011 --> 01:53:23.013]  I mean, I guess serial killers should try that when they get called a bunch of dead bodies.
[01:53:23.033 --> 01:53:24.093]  Well, I didn't mean to kill them.
[01:53:24.634 --> 01:53:25.774]  Oh, well, then go free then.
[01:53:25.794 --> 01:53:27.635]  Well, these are terrorists.
[01:53:27.655 --> 01:53:28.655]  They don't have the same rights.
[01:53:28.735 --> 01:53:29.296]  Come on, folks.
[01:53:29.316 --> 01:53:30.236]  They're not even terrorists.
[01:53:31.041 --> 01:53:32.122]  This is all by design.
[01:53:33.403 --> 01:53:43.770]  Professor, comments to what Eric in Oklahoma was just saying about just both political parties in this whole system?
[01:53:45.191 --> 01:53:50.274]  Well, first of all, I was grateful to Eric for his kind comments about my work.
[01:53:50.314 --> 01:53:51.215]  I appreciate that.
[01:53:53.476 --> 01:53:58.780]  You know, his comments were, I thought, very provocative, but also very broad.
[01:53:59.140 --> 01:54:00.201]  I think he's right that
[01:54:00.808 --> 01:54:08.515]  You know, the things that we had taken for granted for many years about the left and the right have gotten twisted and very confusing.
[01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:18.924]  On the one hand, the political spectrum has moved far to the right when you look at what's going on in Washington, and we're seeing things that would have been really unheard of years ago.
[01:54:19.004 --> 01:54:23.308]  I mean, one of the reasons I wrote this book, Torture and Truth, was because I
[01:54:24.372 --> 01:54:32.914]  We're seeing Americans undertake acts of torture that I used to cover in Latin America twenty years ago, twenty-five years ago.
[01:54:32.934 --> 01:54:35.154]  You say move to the right.
[01:54:35.474 --> 01:54:39.875]  I mean, record budgets, 2.6 trillion, open borders.
[01:54:40.155 --> 01:54:47.957]  Very good point, which I was going to get to, which is that at the same time as you have a defiantly right-wing agenda,
[01:54:48.658 --> 01:55:08.123]  You also have, particularly on the financial fiscal side, the spending side, the fact that the government came into office, supposedly a very conservative administration, with a budget surplus of over $200 billion and has changed that into a budget deficit of nearly $500 billion.
[01:55:08.883 --> 01:55:14.004]  It's been the largest shift in the fiscal status of the government in the history of the United States.
[01:55:14.744 --> 01:55:18.726]  And by the way, most of that extra expenditure is not even military.
[01:55:18.766 --> 01:55:24.528]  It's all the classic big government control, social welfare garbage.
[01:55:24.548 --> 01:55:25.629]  Let's take another call.
[01:55:26.189 --> 01:55:27.670]  Let's talk to Barney in Maryland.
[01:55:27.710 --> 01:55:30.091]  Barney, you're on the air with our CFR member.
[01:55:30.131 --> 01:55:30.511]  Go ahead.
[01:55:32.272 --> 01:55:32.972]  Go ahead, Barney.
[01:55:34.332 --> 01:55:35.513]  Barney, come to your telephone.
[01:55:36.053 --> 01:55:36.513]  You with me?
[01:55:36.773 --> 01:55:37.114]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:38.654 --> 01:55:42.436]  This might seem radical, but once you've been to war, it fits.
[01:55:43.434 --> 01:55:53.870]  I believe that in Iraq, same as the wars in Korea and Vietnam, the purpose is to take us down to a fourth world country.
[01:55:54.632 --> 01:55:57.837]  That there is a planned economic crisis.
[01:55:58.550 --> 01:56:01.291]  That millions of American people will be killed?
[01:56:01.671 --> 01:56:02.311]  No, you're right.
[01:56:02.351 --> 01:56:11.974]  The globalists use America as the imperial model to grab and consolidate more countries under IMF-World Bank control than Europe comes in, like the good cop.
[01:56:11.994 --> 01:56:14.135]  But the professor, I think, disagrees with that.
[01:56:14.775 --> 01:56:26.018]  Well, I believe that in the end, the patriots and the fascists and the captive nations around the world and the United States are going to win by eliminating all the one-worlders.
[01:56:27.175 --> 01:56:28.576]  Professor, final comments?
[01:56:30.078 --> 01:56:38.084]  Well, I'm not... I don't know about reducing America to fourth world status.
[01:56:38.104 --> 01:56:48.192]  I think, as a master plan, I don't think what the Bush administration has done seems to fit in, at least in my view, with that.
[01:56:48.492 --> 01:56:50.233]  Oh, they're driving down the dollar?
[01:56:50.654 --> 01:56:52.856]  They're de-industrializing us?
[01:56:53.916 --> 01:56:55.738]  All of this looks like looting, Professor.
[01:56:56.438 --> 01:57:04.446]  Well, they are driving down the dollar, that's quite true, which is one of the ways, of course, to deal with the enormous debt that they've got.
[01:57:04.466 --> 01:57:05.306]  Hidden inflation, yeah.
[01:57:05.547 --> 01:57:13.534]  The Reagan administration did it as well, but I think that's a far cry from talking about, you know, a fourth world country.
[01:57:13.574 --> 01:57:15.596]  There's a major shift of income.
[01:57:16.804 --> 01:57:17.404]  We're good to go.
[01:57:50.214 --> 01:57:50.855]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.535 --> 01:57:52.575]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.295 --> 01:57:54.396]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.056 --> 01:57:55.876]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.637 --> 01:57:57.517]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.537 --> 01:58:01.818]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.379 --> 01:58:06.500]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.561 --> 01:58:12.542]  Alright, I've been getting better about taking a lot more calls on this broadcast.
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:16.042]  And I'm going to take about 20-year calls in this hour.
[01:58:16.062 --> 01:58:18.464]  Have your questions and comments ready, your statements ready.
[01:58:18.484 --> 01:58:20.265]  We're going to move on to the next person.
[01:58:20.285 --> 01:58:22.326]  We're going to get more into Terri Schiavo Schindler.
[01:58:23.787 --> 01:58:27.070]  The record levels of massive earthquakes around the globe, the 8.7.
[01:58:27.390 --> 01:58:32.574]  In the exact same spot as the megaquake of December 26th of 2004.
[01:58:34.035 --> 01:58:34.956]  Hundreds dead.
[01:58:34.976 --> 01:58:40.019]  I also want to get into who our new Secretary General may be.
[01:58:40.080 --> 01:58:42.281]  Kofi Annan is talking about leaving.
[01:58:42.341 --> 01:58:43.302]  It's all coming up.
[01:58:44.076 --> 01:58:46.757]  For the first time in the last two hours, we have a couple open lines.
[01:58:46.797 --> 01:58:53.820]  If you want to fill those up, it's 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:54.600]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:54.920 --> 01:58:59.502]  When you hear a caller hang up and we're done with a caller, that's your chance to speed dial and get in.
[01:58:59.542 --> 01:59:00.843]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:59:00.863 --> 01:59:01.703]  800-259-9231.
[01:59:01.723 --> 01:59:03.944]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[01:59:04.424 --> 01:59:05.685]  Alki in Hawaii!
[01:59:05.885 --> 01:59:06.085]  Aloha!
[01:59:06.825 --> 01:59:07.606]  Hello.
[01:59:08.986 --> 01:59:09.506]  How you doing?
[01:59:09.727 --> 01:59:10.927]  I think I'm doing pretty good.
[01:59:11.367 --> 01:59:13.128]  I think you're right on the mark about
[01:59:13.726 --> 01:59:26.729]  I'm trying to change the mindset because I was watching TV last night and basically I saw a commercial show about cops and all they really talked about was torture but that's what I wanted to say about you.
[01:59:26.749 --> 01:59:28.829]  And how it was good and how it saved good people.
[01:59:29.409 --> 01:59:35.930]  Furthermore, I think this is all just part of their plan to reduce the world population, right?
[01:59:36.351 --> 01:59:36.771]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:37.091 --> 01:59:39.551]  Because they give us these fake flu shots.
[01:59:39.811 --> 01:59:43.472]  I went to the World Health Organization website
[01:59:44.312 --> 01:59:52.818]  And they actually have their test on their website of their approved flu vaccinations and it's just like mercury.
[01:59:52.838 --> 01:59:54.098]  That's all there is.
[01:59:54.158 --> 02:00:01.323]  They actually increase the level of mercury and the flu shot they give you never covers whatever the real flu is that year.
[02:00:01.583 --> 02:00:08.688]  I looked at the flu shot I took when I was six years old and it was, they put mercury into my damn arm.
[02:00:09.588 --> 02:00:11.049]  This makes me mad when I think about it.
[02:00:11.209 --> 02:00:23.094]  And they put hundreds of times the safe level and Nobel Prize winners, top epidemiologists have said people who've had a bunch of these flu shots are a thousand times more likely to get neurological disorders and Alzheimer's.
[02:00:23.894 --> 02:00:27.415]  I think they're trying to just kill as much people as they can.
[02:00:27.435 --> 02:00:33.417]  But what it is, fluoride, sodium fluoride, mercury, all of it, is an IQ reducer.
[02:00:33.457 --> 02:00:34.557]  We have their own documents.
[02:00:34.597 --> 02:00:45.800]  The first people to use fluoride, and this is mainstream, famous history books, that Nazis put high levels of fluoride in the water at the camps to sedate the prisoners.
[02:00:45.860 --> 02:00:47.801]  It's a toxic, sedative,
[02:00:48.747 --> 02:00:50.228]  And, uh, this is what they're doing.
[02:00:50.288 --> 02:00:51.989]  I mean, you think vaccines are bad, buddy.
[02:00:52.349 --> 02:00:54.411]  The fluoride's even worse, and it's almost impossible.
[02:00:54.431 --> 02:00:56.392]  I live in Hawaii, where there's no fluoridation.
[02:00:57.272 --> 02:00:58.653]  I'm, uh, I don't know.
[02:00:58.993 --> 02:01:00.294]  There's no fluoridation in Hawaii.
[02:01:00.895 --> 02:01:05.397]  I got out of high school at age 16, and I'm in college right now, in college calculus.
[02:01:05.457 --> 02:01:06.238]  Well, good job!
[02:01:06.698 --> 02:01:06.878]  Yeah.
[02:01:07.418 --> 02:01:08.219]  So, uh, how long have you been on board?
[02:01:08.239 --> 02:01:08.939]  I don't know what to do.
[02:01:09.160 --> 02:01:11.181]  How long have you been on board the broadcast, Alki?
[02:01:11.801 --> 02:01:16.124]  Oh, I started listening to you guys by, like, when I was, like, 15, I think.
[02:01:17.864 --> 02:01:18.705]  I'm 17 right now.
[02:01:19.005 --> 02:01:22.167]  I got out of the... Well, are you waking up the young folks around you?
[02:01:22.187 --> 02:01:26.911]  A lot of them are already woken up because there's no fluoridation here.
[02:01:26.931 --> 02:01:29.133]  They can already tell something's going wrong.
[02:01:30.073 --> 02:01:33.836]  Well, San Antonio is a very patriotic anti-New World Order city.
[02:01:34.257 --> 02:01:37.539]  They just became fluoridated two years ago and they're already fighting to remove it.
[02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:42.063]  And folks, I know Stanley Kubrick says you're a kook if you believe it's bad.
[02:01:42.403 --> 02:01:44.604]  We have thousands of medical reports.
[02:01:44.705 --> 02:01:45.025]  It is
[02:01:45.545 --> 02:01:49.949]  Deadly, and I'm not talking about calcium fluoride that's already existing in the water.
[02:01:50.449 --> 02:01:54.312]  That's not bad for you, and you actually need some calcium fluoride.
[02:01:54.833 --> 02:02:02.178]  Sodium fluoride, though, is taken directly from the toxic waste of aluminum and fertilizer production, and has other toxins in it as well.
[02:02:02.238 --> 02:02:03.259]  Thanks for the call, Alki.
[02:02:03.279 --> 02:02:03.560]  Alright.
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:06.142]  And we're going to be getting more, because I haven't done this in years.
[02:02:06.162 --> 02:02:09.044]  I'm going to have a bunch of guests on, doctor, scientist, Nobel Prize.
[02:02:09.793 --> 02:02:13.275]  About fluoride, we're going to talk about aspartame, which is just as bad.
[02:02:13.736 --> 02:02:16.638]  We're going to be talking about all of this, and I'm going to do more.
[02:02:17.478 --> 02:02:21.361]  All the stuff I covered five, six, seven years ago, I'm bringing it all back.
[02:02:22.822 --> 02:02:24.963]  Because, you know, I mean, I covered this stuff for years on end.
[02:02:24.983 --> 02:02:26.264]  I've got to give it a break for a while.
[02:02:27.465 --> 02:02:29.826]  I've been mainly on secret police camps, torture.
[02:02:32.048 --> 02:02:34.950]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:34.970 --> 02:02:38.553]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:38.654 --> 02:02:41.436]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:41.456 --> 02:02:42.657]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.332 --> 02:03:02.193]  Panama.
[02:03:02.394 --> 02:03:06.618]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.678 --> 02:03:13.626]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.746 --> 02:03:15.749]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.109 --> 02:03:26.557]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.738 --> 02:03:32.102]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:03:32.622 --> 02:03:36.525]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:36.545 --> 02:03:36.986]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:37.006 --> 02:03:38.827]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:45.192 --> 02:03:48.473]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.513 --> 02:03:52.715]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:52.955 --> 02:03:55.736]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.936 --> 02:03:58.317]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.517 --> 02:04:07.161]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.361 --> 02:04:08.701]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:04:08.901 --> 02:04:13.063]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.403 --> 02:04:13.903]  We're good to go!
[02:04:42.278 --> 02:04:43.704]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:44.765 --> 02:04:46.446]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:04:46.646 --> 02:04:48.627]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:04:48.867 --> 02:04:49.547]  Prepare yourself.
[02:04:49.707 --> 02:04:53.409]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[02:05:03.653 --> 02:05:05.254]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.

[02:05:08.175 --> 02:05:08.816]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[02:05:14.762 --> 02:05:15.042]  U.S.
[02:05:15.082 --> 02:05:16.123]  Gold and Silver Coins.
[02:05:16.223 --> 02:05:17.343]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[02:05:17.483 --> 02:05:18.264]  Which are collectible?

[02:06:36.354 --> 02:06:38.816]  But right now, let's hurry through your calls.
[02:06:39.416 --> 02:06:40.957]  Don in Pennsylvania.
[02:06:41.017 --> 02:06:41.698]  Welcome, Don.
[02:06:41.898 --> 02:06:42.458]  Hi, Alex.
[02:06:42.498 --> 02:06:43.159]  Am I coming through clear?
[02:06:44.540 --> 02:06:45.280]  Roger that.
[02:06:45.400 --> 02:06:46.221]  Okay, great.
[02:06:46.601 --> 02:06:49.543]  I just have a real quick technical question, then I will get out of your way and just listen.
[02:06:49.703 --> 02:06:59.609]  Okay, I'm sure you know what the Hegelian dialectic is, where there's the propaganda strategy, where they... You know what the Hegelian dialectic is.
[02:06:59.629 --> 02:07:00.650]  Create a crisis.
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:09.728]  Demonstrate the fear, say something must be done, and the very people that created the crisis, or accentuated it, then bring you the solution.
[02:07:09.808 --> 02:07:11.450]  Okay, then you know what I mean by political strategy?
[02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:12.991]  I'm sorry, propaganda strategy.
[02:07:13.011 --> 02:07:25.884]  What I need to know is, is when they, what is a strategy called, when they present, say, a nugget of truth, wrapped around with a lie, and then when you counter the lie, they sidestep the answer, and they go back to, what, don't you believe in, and then they
[02:07:26.440 --> 02:07:27.701]  Put the negative truth out there again.
[02:07:27.741 --> 02:07:29.001]  Do you follow what I'm asking?
[02:07:29.102 --> 02:07:32.283]  Yeah, there's different terms of that, and I was thinking about that today.
[02:07:32.363 --> 02:07:41.628]  I mean, there'll be a real crisis, it's just their solution is opportunistic and has nothing to do with the actual crisis.
[02:07:42.629 --> 02:07:49.733]  So really, I mean, there's not so much a term for it, it's just a tactic.
[02:07:50.073 --> 02:07:52.975]  Well, what I mean is, do you know what, okay,
[02:07:54.116 --> 02:07:58.808]  There's different names of strategies, like where they say, for example, that we need to keep our kids safe, and that's true.
[02:07:59.321 --> 02:08:02.342]  And then they say, to do that, we've got to give them vaccine shots, which is not true.
[02:08:02.362 --> 02:08:08.285]  And then we have to show that vaccines do not keep them safe, even if they're clean, healthy vaccines.
[02:08:08.665 --> 02:08:16.329]  Then we show the strategy in the documents of the elite to put different toxins and things that sterilize and other things in the vaccines.
[02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:23.512]  Well, what I mean is whenever they present... But even if you give somebody a term, they're not going to know what the term means.
[02:08:23.552 --> 02:08:25.053]  You're going to have to explain that to them.
[02:08:25.464 --> 02:08:25.764]  Okay.
[02:08:25.824 --> 02:08:27.025]  Well, I was looking for the term.
[02:08:27.065 --> 02:08:27.446]  That's okay.
[02:08:27.566 --> 02:08:28.867]  I'll just explain it the way I do in this.
[02:08:28.887 --> 02:08:29.207]  Thanks.
[02:08:30.288 --> 02:08:30.769]  I love your show.
[02:08:30.789 --> 02:08:32.470]  You're doing a great job again, and have a good one, Alex.
[02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:33.471]  Well, I appreciate you.
[02:08:33.831 --> 02:08:38.435]  Look, America was founded on mistrust of government.
[02:08:39.856 --> 02:08:47.683]  The Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers, the two sides, agreed that don't trust government, keep control of it, keep it very small.
[02:08:49.905 --> 02:08:52.727]  Folks in this nation were very distrustful of government.
[02:08:54.702 --> 02:08:58.163]  I mean, you'd get tarred and feathered if you started trying to push government's good on people.
[02:08:59.503 --> 02:09:00.424]  They had common sense.
[02:09:00.464 --> 02:09:01.144]  They had history.
[02:09:02.204 --> 02:09:06.045]  But then they gave us the fake left-right paradigm about a hundred years ago.
[02:09:06.105 --> 02:09:08.166]  No longer was it freedom versus slavery.
[02:09:08.666 --> 02:09:10.987]  Does this government give me more freedom and more liberty?
[02:09:11.327 --> 02:09:13.387]  Does it leave me alone or does it try to control me?
[02:09:13.867 --> 02:09:16.128]  That was the political debate, not Republican-Democrat.
[02:09:18.522 --> 02:09:25.508]  Then it shifted to left-right, when the left and right are both for the very same things, just different implementation and different rhetoric.
[02:09:25.828 --> 02:09:26.689]  That confused people.
[02:09:26.709 --> 02:09:28.050]  Then we had World War II.
[02:09:29.071 --> 02:09:31.453]  The government propaganda got sophisticated after the war.
[02:09:31.873 --> 02:09:33.175]  People became very trustful.
[02:09:34.195 --> 02:09:35.877]  So many goods and services were produced.
[02:09:35.917 --> 02:09:42.963]  We had such incredible prosperity that we got lulled into a false sense of security.
[02:09:44.563 --> 02:09:48.907]  And now, some people think you're a kook if you don't trust the government.
[02:09:50.108 --> 02:09:54.071]  Or most people know the government's out of control, but still they say, oh, that's just the way it is.
[02:09:54.091 --> 02:09:55.972]  There's kind of a fatalistic view of it.
[02:09:57.574 --> 02:10:03.298]  So I think that's kind of what you're getting at, but people look at politics two-dimensional.
[02:10:04.119 --> 02:10:10.224]  They just hear a politician say something and think, okay, well, we don't have any money for the roads, we better put toll roads in.
[02:10:11.747 --> 02:10:28.573]  They don't go get, say, TxDOT, Texas Department of Transportation's own documents that have been released that say, we got plenty of money, we got giant slush funds, we've been paid off by select corporations to give them the roads to tax the daylights out of the people and keep the money themselves.
[02:10:29.013 --> 02:10:34.575]  Privatization, see, people hear the word privatization and think, well, I'm for privatization, but is it really privatization?
[02:10:37.108 --> 02:10:54.414]  No, it's not privatization to take an existing public works and give it for pennies on the dollar to a private corporation that's paid off the government, who's then going to become government itself in its actions, but with a corporate membrane protecting it with basically no liability.
[02:10:58.455 --> 02:11:00.076]  Here's the analogy of privatization.
[02:11:00.176 --> 02:11:03.017]  You've paid for 50 years for a big city golf course.
[02:11:04.179 --> 02:11:13.223]  And the owner of a golf course company pays for the campaign of everybody they run for city council and the new mayor.
[02:11:13.243 --> 02:11:27.509]  They get elected, and there's been real cases of this, and the city literally, for no money, just signs over the golf course and the profits and says, oh, they'll do a better job of managing this private corporation.
[02:11:28.250 --> 02:11:31.071]  The fees are going to go down now at the city golf course.
[02:11:32.958 --> 02:11:41.720]  But then you forget two years after that happens, and they double the prices, and then they take a city property you paid for, and they call that privatization.
[02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:42.320]  No.
[02:11:42.880 --> 02:11:44.460]  That's what the Russian oligarchs did.
[02:11:45.700 --> 02:11:46.461]  Six guys.
[02:11:46.981 --> 02:11:53.722]  And it's now come out in the BBC and London Independent, that those six guys were all agents of Lord Rothschild.
[02:11:54.802 --> 02:11:55.842]  That's mainstream news.
[02:11:56.102 --> 02:11:59.263]  Lord Rothschild, the same guy who's over Buffett and Schwarzenegger.
[02:12:00.720 --> 02:12:10.827]  They had an article two years before he ran for governor, excuse me, a year before he ran for governor, where it said, he's going to be your governor and your president, he's meeting with Lord Rothschild in the Scotsman.
[02:12:11.107 --> 02:12:12.848]  But the point is, they were all front men.
[02:12:14.389 --> 02:12:16.031]  They didn't really own it.
[02:12:16.291 --> 02:12:29.640]  And so, quote, Russia collapses, and then six guys are given by Yeltsin all the industry, the gold mines, the uranium mines, the oil, the timber, the roads,
[02:12:31.141 --> 02:12:32.622]  Six guys, just here.
[02:12:33.163 --> 02:12:33.863]  It's yours.
[02:12:34.604 --> 02:12:40.008]  Literally, one guy paid for all of the nickel and gold and uranium mines.
[02:12:40.048 --> 02:12:43.150]  He got basically 90% of the mining in Russia.
[02:12:44.091 --> 02:12:49.155]  He got it for, oh I forgot the PBS documentary, it was like a hundred million dollars.
[02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:50.876]  I think it was less than that.
[02:12:50.916 --> 02:12:52.657]  A few years ago I researched this.
[02:12:53.938 --> 02:12:56.600]  And just one of the mines was worth billions.
[02:12:58.542 --> 02:12:58.722]  See?
[02:12:59.955 --> 02:13:02.596]  And of course, Lord Rothschild can't openly own all this himself.
[02:13:02.636 --> 02:13:03.296]  People get angry.
[02:13:03.596 --> 02:13:07.217]  So he has six front men in Russia that own everything.
[02:13:10.438 --> 02:13:12.158]  Now, how is that privatization?
[02:13:12.458 --> 02:13:13.058]  That is not.
[02:13:13.118 --> 02:13:22.800]  That is replacing some communist thugs that basically control all those resources and put it in their own accounts and in their own villas and their own racehorses.
[02:13:24.721 --> 02:13:29.242]  That basically just take it from them and give it to six new guys.
[02:13:30.151 --> 02:13:30.851]  Who are fronts.
[02:13:32.752 --> 02:13:35.993]  But the average person hears the word privatization.
[02:13:36.614 --> 02:13:38.314]  Well, yes, I'm for privatization.
[02:13:38.514 --> 02:13:39.955]  But is it privatization?
[02:13:40.015 --> 02:13:40.195]  No.
[02:13:40.595 --> 02:13:42.876]  It is organized crime consolidation.
[02:13:43.176 --> 02:13:44.517]  And that's what global government's about.
[02:13:44.557 --> 02:13:46.158]  These corporations are bigger than governments.
[02:13:46.678 --> 02:13:53.781]  They are going to give themselves governmental power through a world government they set up to then order around all of our countries.
[02:13:55.181 --> 02:13:56.342]  Let's go back to the calls.
[02:13:57.862 --> 02:13:58.763]  Let's talk to
[02:14:00.026 --> 02:14:00.947]  Jordan in Illinois.
[02:14:01.007 --> 02:14:01.687]  Go ahead, Jordan.
[02:14:02.128 --> 02:14:02.628]  Hey, Alex.
[02:14:02.688 --> 02:14:04.269]  I just wanted to finish my point from yesterday.
[02:14:04.289 --> 02:14:06.491]  I know you had so much stuff that you had to get through it all.
[02:14:07.111 --> 02:14:10.434]  Um, but I was telling you there are two things about the Terry Schiavo case that were bothering me.
[02:14:10.454 --> 02:14:16.078]  Uh, one of your callers earlier today was saying how there has to be something that's going on.
[02:14:16.098 --> 02:14:17.879]  He was saying the guy might be CIA.
[02:14:17.939 --> 02:14:19.200]  Well, I've
[02:14:19.602 --> 02:14:22.327]  I've been hearing a lot from people who actually live in Clearwater.
[02:14:22.627 --> 02:14:25.672]  Well listen, I don't want you to comment, but listen.
[02:14:26.093 --> 02:14:30.981]  The government wants to set the precedent to kill people and not pay for them.
[02:14:31.121 --> 02:14:31.282]  Right.
[02:14:32.152 --> 02:14:34.873]  Not because they don't have money, but because they want it all to go to themselves.
[02:14:34.974 --> 02:14:35.214]  Right.
[02:14:35.654 --> 02:14:42.437]  So, there's your conspiracy, is that the death-loving culture is pushing this.
[02:14:42.477 --> 02:14:43.097]  But go ahead.
[02:14:43.257 --> 02:14:49.380]  Well, I just wanted to say that it seems that everybody who lives there, and from what I've read, this all has to do with Scientology.
[02:14:49.400 --> 02:14:54.343]  It's like a cult thing where the Clearwater Bar Association is all involved in it.
[02:14:55.823 --> 02:14:59.125]  The police and Bush, who gives money to them, and yadda yadda.
[02:14:59.205 --> 02:15:00.966]  I just wanted to add that into the fray.
[02:15:01.616 --> 02:15:09.918]  I've read the reports and the evidence is extremely tenuous.
[02:15:10.178 --> 02:15:12.098]  Folks, I'm not a Scientologist.
[02:15:12.218 --> 02:15:14.098]  I don't know any Scientologists.
[02:15:14.798 --> 02:15:16.479]  I don't read L. Ron Hubbard.
[02:15:16.499 --> 02:15:18.419]  I didn't mean to say anything like that.
[02:15:18.499 --> 02:15:20.019]  I know, but I get those emails.
[02:15:22.640 --> 02:15:29.041]  Understand, folks, that I'm not just going to run out and say some group is behind something.
[02:15:30.081 --> 02:15:35.003]  Uh, just because, I mean, what we do know is his lawyer is a pro-death guy.
[02:15:35.803 --> 02:15:40.885]  And they admit that they're using this as a poster child, so there's your conspiracy right there.
[02:15:40.905 --> 02:15:41.906]  Yeah, thank God, Alex.
[02:15:42.366 --> 02:15:45.987]  I mean, have you read the stuff his lawyer's written about the death of one of his family members?
[02:15:46.387 --> 02:15:46.608]  Yeah.
[02:15:46.748 --> 02:15:47.868]  I mean, this guy's a sicko.
[02:15:47.908 --> 02:15:48.868]  I mean, there it is right there.
[02:15:49.789 --> 02:15:50.409]  Thanks for the call.
[02:15:51.389 --> 02:15:57.812]  I mean, I've read that stuff, and it's like, yeah, Clearwater's nearby, and there's a Scientologist in the area, and
[02:15:58.519 --> 02:16:04.061]  L. Ron Hubbard said we've got a quarantine 2.0s and under, which I don't like the sound of.
[02:16:04.101 --> 02:16:06.623]  That sounds pretty eugenics style.
[02:16:07.083 --> 02:16:09.424]  So I'll say I don't agree with L. Ron Hubbard on that.
[02:16:10.284 --> 02:16:11.985]  But does that mean they're involved?
[02:16:12.045 --> 02:16:13.626]  I mean, there's not any real evidence.
[02:16:14.526 --> 02:16:16.687]  And now all those people will attack me?
[02:16:16.707 --> 02:16:17.567]  Fine.
[02:16:17.587 --> 02:16:21.809]  I mean, people are saying that the Schindlers are involved in all this.
[02:16:22.849 --> 02:16:24.310]  I don't think there's evidence of that.
[02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:25.991]  Now I'm involved, see?
[02:16:27.127 --> 02:16:28.909]  Okay, fine.
[02:16:29.629 --> 02:16:31.271]  I work for the Easter Bunny, too.
[02:16:32.051 --> 02:16:33.833]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:16:33.873 --> 02:16:34.593]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:16:35.074 --> 02:16:36.495]  Alex, thanks for all your hard work.
[02:16:36.515 --> 02:16:39.157]  You are like a breath of fresh air in a broccoli farm.
[02:16:39.377 --> 02:16:39.817]  Well, thank you.
[02:16:40.177 --> 02:16:42.119]  I don't know what that means, but okay.
[02:16:42.459 --> 02:16:43.500]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:16:43.720 --> 02:16:48.104]  As evil and tragic as events are, I have a quick comment and a question for you.
[02:16:48.584 --> 02:16:54.949]  As evil and tragic as the events are, I noticed something the other night that gave me just a glimmer of hope.
[02:16:55.652 --> 02:17:00.957]  On George Scarborough with his itty-bitty eyes and he had Pat Buchanan on.
[02:17:01.638 --> 02:17:10.727]  And I'm telling you Alex, you could have been on that show and all been in the same boat with two of these guys and I thought maybe, man, there's a glimmer of hope there if we can get those three guys in the same boat.
[02:17:11.068 --> 02:17:13.770]  And I'm not trying to put any of their thinking onto you.
[02:17:14.011 --> 02:17:15.432]  What was Scarborough talking about?
[02:17:15.452 --> 02:17:16.333]  They're about tribal.
[02:17:17.631 --> 02:17:22.353]  Well, see, the globalists pick issues that we agree with to bind us to them.
[02:17:22.393 --> 02:17:25.955]  But remember, rat poison is 98% nutritious food.
[02:17:26.115 --> 02:17:26.395]  Right.
[02:17:26.775 --> 02:17:37.219]  So do you think that when Terry dies, they'll have the agent provocateurs to come in and start riots so they can ratchet down some police state too and show that, see, we told you, we own you, we control you, we're the gods?
[02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:39.700]  That might happen.
[02:17:40.241 --> 02:17:40.641]  I don't know.
[02:17:40.761 --> 02:17:41.301]  Great point.
[02:17:41.341 --> 02:17:42.422]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:17:46.216 --> 02:17:49.919]  My doctor was truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[02:17:50.199 --> 02:17:51.380]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[02:17:51.420 --> 02:17:56.423]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[02:17:56.483 --> 02:18:00.026]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[02:18:00.086 --> 02:18:02.047]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[02:18:02.067 --> 02:18:03.108]  Cardivite.
[02:18:03.168 --> 02:18:04.689]  We all use Cardivite!
[02:18:05.564 --> 02:18:09.027]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.
[02:18:09.487 --> 02:18:17.854]  Cardivite is an all-natural supplement which is made up of our own special blend of herbs gathered from many different parts of the world, specially designed to improve your health.
[02:18:18.054 --> 02:18:21.096]  Come on and care about yourself just a little more with Cardivite.

[02:18:46.316 --> 02:18:49.318]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:18:49.658 --> 02:18:58.505]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:18:58.805 --> 02:19:03.469]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:19:03.929 --> 02:19:10.671]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:19:11.051 --> 02:19:22.835]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:23.315 --> 02:19:27.777]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:19:27.937 --> 02:19:30.397]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:19:45.686 --> 02:19:47.147]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[02:19:47.447 --> 02:19:52.028]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:19:52.369 --> 02:19:54.710]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:19:54.930 --> 02:19:56.450]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:19:56.850 --> 02:20:01.952]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:20:02.232 --> 02:20:03.453]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[02:20:03.513 --> 02:20:06.214]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[02:20:47.381 --> 02:20:52.866]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:20:53.307 --> 02:20:57.531]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:20:57.771 --> 02:21:04.798]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:21:05.178 --> 02:21:11.284]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:11.424 --> 02:21:12.645]  There are no side effects.
[02:21:12.985 --> 02:21:15.926]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:21:16.086 --> 02:21:18.127]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:21:18.407 --> 02:21:25.630]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:21:25.950 --> 02:21:29.331]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:21:29.751 --> 02:21:32.853]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:21:32.873 --> 02:21:32.913]  866-885-6625.
[02:21:32.933 --> 02:21:33.113]  866-885-6625.
[02:21:33.253 --> 02:21:34.194]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:21:34.214 --> 02:21:34.414]  Call today.
[02:21:56.206 --> 02:21:56.927]  Look, it's simple.
[02:21:57.307 --> 02:22:01.747]  They socialize the wealth to get control of society to domesticate us.
[02:22:03.308 --> 02:22:10.009]  They then transfer those huge institutions into the hands of private corporations that have paid off and controlled the government.
[02:22:10.709 --> 02:22:18.470]  Then, they don't want to give you any more of the quote, large S, or social safety net, so then they start cutting all of that off.
[02:22:19.091 --> 02:22:21.031]  And that's the process we're now in right now.
[02:22:21.718 --> 02:22:27.280]  And instead of fighting that process, people then think that there's actually less resources and start fighting with each other.
[02:22:27.881 --> 02:22:28.961]  That's how the scam works.
[02:22:29.741 --> 02:22:33.663]  Greg in Florida, then Rodney and Leslie and Mike and others.
[02:22:34.083 --> 02:22:34.523]  Go ahead.
[02:22:36.484 --> 02:22:37.584]  Go ahead, Greg in Florida.
[02:22:38.585 --> 02:22:39.125]  Hello, Alex?
[02:22:39.265 --> 02:22:39.505]  Yes.
[02:22:39.945 --> 02:22:40.646]  Hi, how are you?
[02:22:40.806 --> 02:22:41.026]  Good.
[02:22:41.446 --> 02:22:42.446]  I had a couple issues.
[02:22:42.907 --> 02:22:51.350]  First of all, I just purchased a new vehicle and the owner of the dealership told me that they had to check my name against
[02:22:52.122 --> 02:22:54.804]  Yeah, the Patriot Act, yeah.
[02:23:06.388 --> 02:23:07.829]  A lot of businesses have shut down.
[02:23:07.849 --> 02:23:11.171]  There's 500,000 people on a criminal watch list.
[02:23:11.191 --> 02:23:12.652]  That's also there.
[02:23:12.732 --> 02:23:14.252]  350,000 on a terror list.
[02:23:14.673 --> 02:23:16.153]  Most of them have never been convicted.
[02:23:16.173 --> 02:23:20.176]  And now they're talking about expanding it to anyone ever arrested to a misdemeanor.
[02:23:20.196 --> 02:23:21.717]  You won't be able to buy guns, anything.
[02:23:22.357 --> 02:23:23.798]  Everything is going to be on that list.
[02:23:23.838 --> 02:23:29.241]  And if they don't deny you the car, the bank account, the insurance,
[02:23:30.182 --> 02:23:34.286]  There's thousands of things, then they go to prison for 50 years.
[02:23:34.606 --> 02:23:39.391]  Oh yeah, I think, I can't remember exactly what the penalty was.
[02:23:39.832 --> 02:23:44.657]  It's 50 years, a million dollar fine, 10 years, $500,000, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:23:44.797 --> 02:23:52.425]  I think it was like a million dollar fine for not, or for, if he sold the vehicle and
[02:23:53.078 --> 02:23:54.999]  And my name was on that watch list.
[02:23:55.439 --> 02:23:56.660]  Yeah, sir.
[02:23:57.020 --> 02:23:57.940]  I'm telling you what it is.
[02:23:58.921 --> 02:24:02.362]  There's a million bucks and 50 years in prison.
[02:24:02.742 --> 02:24:11.486]  There's $500,000 and five years in... There's about, I don't know, it was like seven different penalties, different calculations, but we're talking about hard prison time.
[02:24:12.027 --> 02:24:18.029]  If you sell anything to anybody, including cashing a check for anyone on a watch list, it's just like the flying list.
[02:24:18.249 --> 02:24:19.570]  There's all these innocent people on it.
[02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:20.471]  Exactly.
[02:24:20.611 --> 02:24:21.512]  Sound like freedom to you?
[02:24:21.952 --> 02:24:22.553]  Not really.
[02:24:22.993 --> 02:24:27.716]  But they order the states to issue ID cards to anyone with any fake ID.
[02:24:28.056 --> 02:24:28.637]  That's true.
[02:24:29.837 --> 02:24:40.544]  The next issue was over on Easter we watched The Passion of the Christ and there's amazing similarities between that movie and what's going on with Terri Schiavo.
[02:24:40.664 --> 02:24:42.405]  Oh yeah, they're torturing her to death.
[02:24:42.425 --> 02:24:49.430]  And when you watch the movie and you see where he was carrying the cross and that woman came up to give him water
[02:24:50.189 --> 02:24:54.931]  And the authorities came and kicked the water glass out of her hand.
[02:24:55.411 --> 02:25:06.435]  I mean, it's just so amazing how... I mean, I think there's an intent there, definitely.
[02:25:06.515 --> 02:25:10.756]  The parallels are very scary.
[02:25:11.516 --> 02:25:12.157]  Exactly.
[02:25:12.197 --> 02:25:12.997]  Very poignant.
[02:25:13.017 --> 02:25:13.697]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:13.717 --> 02:25:14.197]  Thank you.
[02:25:14.537 --> 02:25:16.458]  Rodney in Texas, welcome.
[02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:19.751]  Hello Alex, how are you?
[02:25:19.851 --> 02:25:20.251]  Good, sir.
[02:25:21.432 --> 02:25:30.180]  Today I'm looking at a story out of the Baltimore Sun's news section, and this shows you the hypocrisy of our courts here.
[02:25:30.200 --> 02:25:32.602]  It talks about the Supreme Court's waivers
[02:25:33.223 --> 02:25:34.044]  We're good to go.
[02:26:03.666 --> 02:26:07.623]  Dying and these guys don't even want to hear the case.
[02:26:08.638 --> 02:26:14.963]  And yet, these Mexican nationals who are on death row... Sir, this is the most socialistic court ever.
[02:26:15.383 --> 02:26:17.285]  Seven of the nine appointed by Republicans.
[02:26:17.605 --> 02:26:19.947]  The Republicans have a huge majority in the House and Senate.
[02:26:19.967 --> 02:26:22.209]  They have the executive, 30-plus state governors.
[02:26:22.649 --> 02:26:24.271]  And do you see government getting smaller?
[02:26:24.291 --> 02:26:25.031]  Do you see freedom?
[02:26:25.071 --> 02:26:26.753]  No, you see gun laws being passed.
[02:26:27.173 --> 02:26:28.274]  You see open borders.
[02:26:28.314 --> 02:26:29.755]  You see total world government.
[02:26:29.815 --> 02:26:31.216]  Yeah, they take their marching orders.
[02:26:31.276 --> 02:26:35.520]  I mean, you can see in the article, they're taking their marching orders from the World Court.
[02:26:35.640 --> 02:26:37.181]  And I guess I'm wondering now,
[02:26:38.192 --> 02:26:41.496]  Do we know anything about the people who sit on the world court?
[02:26:42.538 --> 02:26:45.761]  You have no right to be arrested for criticizing government.
[02:26:46.242 --> 02:26:50.847]  Euthanasia is enforced by the European and international courts.
[02:26:51.788 --> 02:26:52.309]  It's horrible.
[02:26:52.750 --> 02:26:53.290]  It's bad.
[02:26:53.470 --> 02:26:53.971]  It's bad.
[02:26:54.051 --> 02:26:57.135]  And I looked at that and I said, oh my God, this is...
[02:26:58.179 --> 02:27:01.942]  This is the reason why we're not getting a response from the court.
[02:27:02.202 --> 02:27:08.107]  But the average yuppie driving along in their car right now doesn't believe there's a world government, even as it's in all the big Canadian papers.
[02:27:08.347 --> 02:27:11.069]  That's all I wanted to touch base with you and Alex.
[02:27:11.489 --> 02:27:12.650]  Keep up the good work, friend.
[02:27:13.070 --> 02:27:13.831]  Thank you, Rodney.
[02:27:13.871 --> 02:27:15.032]  Always good to hear from you.
[02:27:15.412 --> 02:27:22.297]  Leslie, Mike and others, you're straight ahead when we get back.
[02:27:22.317 --> 02:27:22.678]  800-259-9231.
[02:27:22.698 --> 02:27:27.101]  Now we'll get some into the earthquake of yesterday and the increased seismic and
[02:27:28.118 --> 02:27:30.221]  Volcanic activities and a lot more.
[02:27:30.882 --> 02:27:33.886]  On the other side of this quick break, stay with us.
[02:27:36.289 --> 02:27:37.191]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.691 --> 02:27:39.294]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.215 --> 02:27:42.898]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.756 --> 02:27:49.897]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:27:50.098 --> 02:27:52.799]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:27:52.999 --> 02:27:54.380]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:27:54.560 --> 02:28:04.464]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:28:04.684 --> 02:28:06.425]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[02:28:06.705 --> 02:28:10.588]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[02:28:10.808 --> 02:28:15.232]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:28:15.432 --> 02:28:19.255]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[02:28:19.515 --> 02:28:25.700]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:28:25.900 --> 02:28:28.702]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:28:28.862 --> 02:28:32.225]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no hassle one year money back guarantee.
[02:28:32.305 --> 02:28:36.128]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[02:28:36.288 --> 02:28:40.131]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[02:28:40.371 --> 02:28:44.614]  That's 1-866-833-M-A-N-T-I-S.
[02:28:46.155 --> 02:28:49.738]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.

[02:30:52.163 --> 02:30:54.923]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.344 --> 02:30:58.864]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:30:59.345 --> 02:31:03.606]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:31:03.626 --> 02:31:06.126]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:31:06.246 --> 02:31:08.767]  The ring of fire.
[02:31:08.827 --> 02:31:10.747]  The ring of fire.
[02:31:11.148 --> 02:31:14.048]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[02:31:14.868 --> 02:31:16.349]  The ring of fire.
[02:31:20.531 --> 02:31:21.252]  I can't help it.
[02:31:21.792 --> 02:31:22.953]  I like the men in black.
[02:31:24.214 --> 02:31:25.554]  Why do you wear black, Johnny?
[02:31:25.835 --> 02:31:29.777]  I wear black to remind people of all the bad things that are happening in the world.
[02:31:30.858 --> 02:31:37.842]  I'd love to wear a suit of white, but I can't, so until the world's a better place, I'll wear a suit of black.
[02:31:39.663 --> 02:31:40.884]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:31:42.708 --> 02:31:44.030]  I want to take your calls 1-800-259-9231.

[02:31:55.956 --> 02:31:56.877]  This is not a drill!
[02:31:57.598 --> 02:31:59.179]  Evil has spread across the land!
[02:31:59.240 --> 02:32:00.020]  Martial law!

[02:32:13.654 --> 02:32:15.296]  The Constitution has been shredded!
[02:32:15.536 --> 02:32:17.258]  And America is now a police state!
[02:32:17.893 --> 02:32:23.819]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.

[02:32:28.663 --> 02:32:40.534]  From the front lines of the police state, to the darkest sanctum of the secret society that controls it, martial law reveals the master plan of a group hell-bent on capturing America today and tomorrow the world.
[02:32:41.474 --> 02:32:43.936]  The New World Order has set in motion the Fourth Reich.
[02:32:44.416 --> 02:32:48.598]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:32:48.958 --> 02:32:57.483]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:09.532]  It's a Skull and Bones death cult film.
[02:33:09.812 --> 02:33:11.013]  It's a police state film.
[02:33:11.073 --> 02:33:12.314]  It is my best work.
[02:33:13.115 --> 02:33:15.396]  And you really need to get it and make copies.

[02:33:26.525 --> 02:33:27.566]  It's having an effect.
[02:33:27.586 --> 02:33:30.468]  The truth can smash mountains of lies.

[02:34:29.418 --> 02:34:31.500]  Or as I said, 888-253-3139.
[02:34:31.901 --> 02:34:37.066]  Alright, let's just accelerate, blast through your calls.
[02:34:37.266 --> 02:34:38.927]  Leslie in Virginia, welcome.
[02:34:39.408 --> 02:34:40.369]  Hi, thanks Alex.
[02:34:41.130 --> 02:34:51.700]  When you were interviewing the professor, he mentioned that when the Council of Foreign Relations was set up,
[02:34:52.088 --> 02:34:54.469]  We came during the era of Woodrow Wilson.
[02:34:54.589 --> 02:34:57.550]  Yeah, because they failed with the League of Nations.
[02:34:57.810 --> 02:34:58.391]  Absolutely.
[02:34:58.431 --> 02:35:02.232]  But the founder of that is none other than Colonel Edward Vandelhouse.
[02:35:02.592 --> 02:35:03.713]  And you know who that guy is.
[02:35:03.733 --> 02:35:05.334]  He's the guy who set up the Federal Reserve.
[02:35:05.394 --> 02:35:10.376]  Yeah, he wrote a book about how they're a global government and how they run everything and how they want a dictatorship.
[02:35:10.436 --> 02:35:12.276]  And he's from right here in Austin, Texas.
[02:35:12.577 --> 02:35:13.397]  Absolutely.
[02:35:13.437 --> 02:35:14.237]  That's the founder.
[02:35:14.317 --> 02:35:15.838]  And what I find interesting is
[02:35:16.394 --> 02:35:17.895]  It's in his book, Torture and Truth.
[02:35:17.955 --> 02:35:18.796]  I haven't read it.
[02:35:19.296 --> 02:35:27.501]  But the point being, in that organization you have over 250 of its members that are journalists, correspondents, and communications executives.
[02:35:28.061 --> 02:35:38.208]  And so this is why we keep hearing on TV that Terry is just being treated and, you know, they don't use the word executed, but that's why we hear this over and over and over again.
[02:35:38.228 --> 02:35:41.170]  Yeah, this allows them of people in key positions of every
[02:35:41.770 --> 02:35:46.292]  strata of the economic grid to have a unified, concerted effort.
[02:35:46.352 --> 02:35:48.013]  Most of them are on the same page.
[02:35:48.153 --> 02:35:56.616]  But what I want, absolutely, what I want to ask, and you're quite aware of the watch list, did he get his book approved, Torture and Truth?
[02:35:56.956 --> 02:36:02.258]  I mean, you know what happens to these demonstrators, and he's writing this book, Torture and Truth?
[02:36:03.019 --> 02:36:06.600]  I mean, do... I hear you, and I appreciate the call, Leslie.
[02:36:06.720 --> 02:36:08.301]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:36:08.361 --> 02:36:09.021]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:36:09.935 --> 02:36:11.016]  Yes, good afternoon Alex.
[02:36:11.376 --> 02:36:11.696]  Hello.
[02:36:12.236 --> 02:36:15.918]  Yes, a little bit about this Terry Schiavo thing, it's kind of an offset.
[02:36:16.339 --> 02:36:23.383]  A couple hours or so ago you had one of your callers, they were saying there was people down there protesting and it had Nazi flags and things.
[02:36:24.343 --> 02:36:29.066]  My kind of question is, you know, I understand that bad things happen in war.
[02:36:29.778 --> 02:36:34.922]  But, you know, every time we meet a boogeyman, it's always Hitler, Hitler, Hitler.
[02:36:35.143 --> 02:36:37.224]  Well, that's true, but in this case, it fits.
[02:36:37.264 --> 02:36:38.686]  Hitler was big on eugenics.
[02:36:39.126 --> 02:36:45.952]  Well, I understand that, but, you know, when you want to talk about some real evil people, and not necessarily... Well, the shoe fits, where?
[02:36:45.972 --> 02:36:48.814]  I mean, Hitler was a pioneer of this exact type of stuff.
[02:36:49.335 --> 02:36:53.859]  Exactly, but we could take a look at, under Stalin, you had Lazar Paganov.
[02:36:53.899 --> 02:36:55.440]  They did the exact same stuff.
[02:36:56.021 --> 02:36:56.541]  Exactly.
[02:36:58.103 --> 02:37:06.387]  Khrushchev said that he was the butcher of the Ukraine, and he was responsible for killing 20 million Christians, and he starved them to death.
[02:37:07.048 --> 02:37:12.871]  And I just, you know, I'm kind of confused, and I say, you know, that there are... No, we exposed Stalin.
[02:37:13.531 --> 02:37:25.938]  Yes, you know, I'm not saying necessarily you, but just, you know, in the whole bigger scheme of things, it's always, you know, whenever there's a boogeyman, it's always Hitler, but nobody ever talks about Stalin and Mao, who made Hitler look like an altar boy.
[02:37:27.424 --> 02:37:29.284]  I hear you, I appreciate the call, Mike.
[02:37:29.384 --> 02:37:30.945]  John in Ohio, you're on the air.
[02:37:31.005 --> 02:37:31.685]  Go ahead, John.
[02:37:32.685 --> 02:37:34.346]  Oh yeah, you got me off on another track.
[02:37:34.426 --> 02:37:37.586]  I agree with you totally on this culture of death.
[02:37:38.386 --> 02:37:54.410]  But we certainly do hear a lot about Stalin, and I would consider that the propaganda of the Cold War as bad as Stalin was, we have to realize there was a powerful vested interest in the Cold War and the military-industrial complex
[02:37:55.037 --> 02:37:57.339]  And exaggerating, even a beast like Stalin.
[02:37:57.359 --> 02:38:00.541]  So I think this... Okay, but you said you had something else on your mind?
[02:38:00.601 --> 02:38:22.735]  Yeah, I was watching CNN last weekend and they wanted to give a prominent coverage to look like Larry Klayman and his statement of trying to bind, as you put it, the pro-life people, and I'm on the left and I agree with you on this, to support for the war, the slaughter in Iraq,
[02:38:23.288 --> 02:38:38.177]  I'm saying that Jeb Bush should ignore the courts, just as the wonderful George Bush ignored the United Nations, which only gave 90% cover for his dirty war, and should have behaved like George Bush did.
[02:38:38.337 --> 02:38:39.978]  Well, forget the United Nations!
[02:38:40.198 --> 02:38:43.300]  Our federal laws say you can't torture people.
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:49.524]  Well, exactly, but what I'm saying is, it shows the agenda of the CNN, the media,
[02:38:50.026 --> 02:38:55.569]  And singling out this comment by Larry Klayman at the demonstrations down there in Pinellas, Florida.
[02:38:56.069 --> 02:38:57.630]  And they're supposedly liberal.
[02:38:57.670 --> 02:38:59.931]  What do you specifically think about Terry Schindler?
[02:39:01.012 --> 02:39:17.081]  Well, I think that, as you say, this is just an attempt to justify enhancing the profits of the HMOs, the insurance companies, the Wall Street banks that hold the debt that those who want to give this huge tax giveaway to the ultra-rich
[02:39:18.117 --> 02:39:29.444]  As a way of then taking that money and resources and redirecting all of the social funds from Medicare, from Medicaid, everything else that George Bush cut off when he was governor.
[02:39:29.604 --> 02:39:32.566]  Okay, and Bush signed a law to just kill you.
[02:39:32.606 --> 02:39:35.108]  People with feeding tubes begging for food, they kill them here in Texas.
[02:39:35.348 --> 02:39:35.888]  Exactly.
[02:39:36.068 --> 02:39:37.549]  And we're not supposed to talk about that.
[02:39:37.769 --> 02:39:38.350]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:39.070 --> 02:39:41.772]  And again, folks, it just shows how it's all controlled by the same people.
[02:39:42.432 --> 02:39:43.052]  Who's up next?
[02:39:44.653 --> 02:39:46.334]  Wanda in Missouri, then Laura.
[02:39:46.374 --> 02:39:47.115]  Wanda, go ahead.
[02:39:48.143 --> 02:39:52.664]  Well, I have a recommendation, a little Bible verse, and a thought.
[02:39:53.544 --> 02:40:13.789]  My recommendation first is that Alex, yesterday, the 28th of March, your explanation of the plans, purposes, and practices of the global elite, who in reality run and control our government, was so lucid and profound, like a revelation to you by God.
[02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:17.050]  I highly recommend today's listeners to call
[02:40:17.651 --> 02:40:22.894]  And order your month of March CD for your March 28th program.
[02:40:23.034 --> 02:40:23.515]  Well, thank you.
[02:40:23.735 --> 02:40:29.198]  I don't sell those, the network does, but for those that have computers and motion of sheet e-players, you get a whole month.
[02:40:29.298 --> 02:40:30.419]  I mean, hundreds of hours.
[02:40:30.439 --> 02:40:34.861]  I don't know, it's 15 hours a week, so 4 times 15, it's not 100 hours, it's what, 60 hours.
[02:40:34.901 --> 02:40:36.262]  How much is it, $19.95 or something?
[02:40:36.282 --> 02:40:36.362]  Yes.
[02:40:36.682 --> 02:40:36.802]  Uh-huh.
[02:40:43.268 --> 02:40:45.370]  I was really impressed with that yesterday.
[02:40:45.410 --> 02:40:46.671]  Well, thank you.
[02:40:46.751 --> 02:40:49.473]  What section were you talking about?
[02:40:49.934 --> 02:40:56.919]  Well, I was talking about when you were explaining about the Global Elite and what their plans, purposes, and practices were.
[02:40:56.939 --> 02:40:59.321]  Talking about peak oil in the third hour?
[02:40:59.441 --> 02:41:00.002]  Oh, yes.
[02:41:00.622 --> 02:41:00.923]  Yes.
[02:41:01.323 --> 02:41:07.208]  And all of the things that they're involved in and why they're involved and how much and whatever.
[02:41:07.228 --> 02:41:08.869]  I thought it was really excellent.
[02:41:09.009 --> 02:41:09.590]  Well, thank you.
[02:41:10.427 --> 02:41:15.471]  And the little scripture that I have is Isaiah 1 verse 7.
[02:41:16.672 --> 02:41:18.373]  Your country is desolate.
[02:41:18.794 --> 02:41:20.655]  Your cities are burned with fire.
[02:41:21.255 --> 02:41:23.677]  Your land, strangers devour it.
[02:41:24.578 --> 02:41:29.622]  And your presence, and it is desolate, is overthrown by strangers.
[02:41:30.282 --> 02:41:36.367]  And to me this describes this elite that is pilfering and everything and changing our laws and whatever.
[02:41:38.703 --> 02:41:39.223]  Well, you're right.
[02:41:39.263 --> 02:41:40.944]  They're pilfering, looting.
[02:41:41.184 --> 02:41:47.007]  I mean, it's almost like they know something big is coming because I've never seen them going this wild.
[02:41:48.648 --> 02:41:48.888]  No.
[02:41:49.689 --> 02:41:55.732]  And my thought is to initiate more prayer and protest regarding Terri Shiloh.
[02:41:55.972 --> 02:41:56.372]  I agree.
[02:41:56.713 --> 02:42:04.737]  More people need to know that when Terri went to the hospital with her heart attack, she also had broken bones and bruises.
[02:42:06.388 --> 02:42:13.452]  Yeah, and now, he didn't want to have an autopsy, Michael Schiavo, but now because of pressure, he's saying he will.
[02:42:13.892 --> 02:42:16.373]  Well, folks, you can't trust these autopsies to begin with.
[02:42:16.413 --> 02:42:18.734]  I mean, we've got, you know, classical cases of this.
[02:42:18.814 --> 02:42:22.316]  If it's that same county doing it, I won't believe the autopsy.
[02:42:22.757 --> 02:42:24.497]  Plus, bones will heal over ten years.
[02:42:26.118 --> 02:42:26.879]  Good to hear from you.
[02:42:27.079 --> 02:42:27.699]  Great points.
[02:42:27.879 --> 02:42:29.560]  Laura in North Carolina.
[02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:30.320]  Laura, go ahead.
[02:42:30.961 --> 02:42:31.421]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:31.461 --> 02:42:31.981]  How you doing?
[02:42:32.402 --> 02:42:32.602]  Good.
[02:42:33.643 --> 02:42:36.265]  I want to mention something about Terri Schiavo.
[02:42:37.686 --> 02:42:42.169]  As far as what it looks like to me, the globalists have an agenda here.
[02:42:42.549 --> 02:42:50.474]  They want martial law, and they're marching Terri out before the people to try to get them spooled up to get on their agenda.
[02:42:50.494 --> 02:42:52.456]  We're not reacting fast enough.
[02:42:52.536 --> 02:42:54.117]  We're not emotional enough.
[02:42:54.137 --> 02:42:56.939]  They're trying to emotionally charge things.
[02:42:57.119 --> 02:42:58.480]  Oh yeah, they're using her for that.
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:03.463]  They're parading her around, going, see what we're doing to her?
[02:43:04.500 --> 02:43:07.222]  See what we're doing to her and it's getting worse and worse.
[02:43:07.322 --> 02:43:14.428]  And people, if you made a statement not too long ago, don't uprise and take to the street.
[02:43:15.449 --> 02:43:16.530]  Don't do it that way.
[02:43:16.870 --> 02:43:19.232]  There's other ways to do what we need to do.
[02:43:20.093 --> 02:43:21.914]  And that's what people need to remember right now.
[02:43:22.114 --> 02:43:24.416]  Don't be caught up in the emotionalism of this.
[02:43:25.537 --> 02:43:27.659]  Yes, Harry is suffering.
[02:43:28.257 --> 02:43:32.505]  We understand that, but God puts each and every one of us here for a reason just like He does you.
[02:43:32.525 --> 02:43:34.608]  He gave you the ability to speak to people.
[02:43:35.189 --> 02:43:39.277]  She may have to go through this in order to do what God wants her to do.
[02:43:40.311 --> 02:43:44.794]  Well, I mean, for every place and time there's a different response.
[02:43:45.955 --> 02:43:48.857]  And what I'm saying is that they want violence.
[02:43:48.897 --> 02:43:53.100]  The government has to blow up its own buildings to blame it on pro-lifers and people.
[02:43:53.120 --> 02:43:54.601]  We've caught them doing it before.
[02:43:54.621 --> 02:44:00.966]  And they've got their snipers up there and they'd love to kill a bunch of people and they're still going to kill Terry.
[02:44:02.030 --> 02:44:06.431]  I mean, I think if a group of peaceful people went in there, and I think what they're trying to do peacefully to stop it is good.
[02:44:07.112 --> 02:44:11.373]  But I have said that they do want to have some type of violent outburst.
[02:44:11.693 --> 02:44:13.193]  But that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:44:13.233 --> 02:44:14.594]  They're making it worse.
[02:44:14.714 --> 02:44:17.735]  I mean, every day it's a little bit more shocking what they're doing.
[02:44:18.195 --> 02:44:19.755]  And it's shock value.
[02:44:20.155 --> 02:44:21.376]  Well, she's now into day 11.
[02:44:21.856 --> 02:44:25.037]  It's been 11 days since they removed her water.
[02:44:25.357 --> 02:44:25.577]  Yeah.
[02:44:26.297 --> 02:44:27.317]  I'm surprised she's hung on.
[02:44:27.377 --> 02:44:29.078]  I figured she'd go over the weekend for sure.
[02:44:29.887 --> 02:44:31.268]  And she's hanging on.
[02:44:31.328 --> 02:44:33.229]  I mean, even she wants to live.
[02:44:33.850 --> 02:44:35.591]  And God's keeping her alive.
[02:44:36.631 --> 02:44:37.672]  It has to be that.
[02:44:37.712 --> 02:44:38.533]  Well, I know this.
[02:44:38.653 --> 02:44:39.913]  It's going to blow up in their face.
[02:44:40.174 --> 02:44:40.974]  Absolutely.
[02:44:41.054 --> 02:44:41.855]  That they've done this.
[02:44:42.075 --> 02:44:45.777]  People need not get caught up in the emotionalism of this.
[02:44:46.077 --> 02:44:47.218]  Look at it for what it is.
[02:44:47.358 --> 02:44:52.401]  We can deal with our situation without taking to the streets and losing control.
[02:44:52.782 --> 02:44:55.363]  Michael Schiavo was nothing more than an OJ.
[02:44:55.803 --> 02:44:57.084]  We know that.
[02:44:57.184 --> 02:44:58.085]  I appreciate your call.
[02:44:59.508 --> 02:45:00.328]  Let me just say this.
[02:45:00.608 --> 02:45:01.968]  You look at national polls.
[02:45:03.969 --> 02:45:09.190]  They've had three decades, what, 32 years of abortion.
[02:45:10.390 --> 02:45:11.290]  50 million in this country.
[02:45:12.830 --> 02:45:19.752]  And despite all their propaganda and all the things they do, record levels of young people, it's like almost 70% now, are against it.
[02:45:20.292 --> 02:45:21.612]  Record numbers of women, about 60%.
[02:45:22.212 --> 02:45:24.172]  About 65% of men.
[02:45:24.753 --> 02:45:27.093]  Just 10 years ago, the numbers were the opposite.
[02:45:28.240 --> 02:45:29.801]  Abortions are now going way down.
[02:45:30.182 --> 02:45:31.062]  They should be outlawed.
[02:45:32.664 --> 02:45:35.666]  But the point is, despite all their propaganda, people are waking up.
[02:45:35.826 --> 02:45:38.328]  Our grassroots education is working.
[02:45:39.509 --> 02:45:44.714]  And the way it's trending in another ten years, there will almost be no abortions in this country, and then we'll be able to outright outlaw it.
[02:45:45.634 --> 02:45:48.256]  And have people give children up for adoption and things like that.
[02:45:49.557 --> 02:45:51.359]  So, it's not going to work for them.
[02:45:51.679 --> 02:45:54.181]  They're not going to get away with their social engineering.
[02:45:55.082 --> 02:45:56.163]  It's not going to happen.
[02:45:57.652 --> 02:45:59.153]  Uh, let's go to Mike in Illinois.
[02:45:59.173 --> 02:45:59.833]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:46:00.293 --> 02:46:00.973]  North Carolina.
[02:46:01.473 --> 02:46:02.033]  North Carolina.
[02:46:02.053 --> 02:46:02.594]  I apologize.
[02:46:02.614 --> 02:46:02.934]  Go ahead.
[02:46:03.314 --> 02:46:11.737]  Alex, uh, I believe that the torture was ordered and probably planned before the war, and I believe it's... Well, that's admitted, sir.
[02:46:11.777 --> 02:46:13.057]  That's in the government's own documents.
[02:46:13.677 --> 02:46:19.859]  Um, I believe it was... They're creating a certain worldview of the United States.
[02:46:19.919 --> 02:46:20.199]  Oh, no!
[02:46:20.239 --> 02:46:21.540]  That's admittedly part of the plan.
[02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:23.000]  We play the part of the bad cop, yes.
[02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:24.741]  Well, it's obvious.
[02:46:25.321 --> 02:46:25.921]  Thank you very much.
[02:46:27.065 --> 02:46:28.046]  What do you think about Terry?
[02:46:29.087 --> 02:46:32.370]  Man, I can't say enough about that subject.
[02:46:33.451 --> 02:46:36.314]  You know, I guess I should be down there myself.
[02:46:36.474 --> 02:46:41.919]  I don't know if I feel guilty for everything I eat and every drop of water that goes into my mouth.
[02:46:41.939 --> 02:46:46.344]  You know, I was just drinking some water, and every time I drink water, I think about Terry now.
[02:46:46.784 --> 02:46:50.268]  It's on my mind every day and all night, Alex Patton Slips, since it started.
[02:46:50.888 --> 02:46:51.509]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:46:52.006 --> 02:46:52.446]  Thank you.
[02:46:52.927 --> 02:46:55.949]  And that's because this individual, Terry, brings it to mind.
[02:46:56.410 --> 02:46:59.392]  Because we think of things and operate on an individual basis.
[02:46:59.832 --> 02:47:05.797]  But I want to remind you, this eugenics is going on all over the country with people who are talking, begging for food.
[02:47:06.057 --> 02:47:06.838]  May I please have food?
[02:47:06.858 --> 02:47:07.579]  May I please have water?
[02:47:08.439 --> 02:47:11.101]  And Bush, the Democrats, they're all behind it.
[02:47:11.562 --> 02:47:12.683]  Schwarzenegger loves it.
[02:47:13.363 --> 02:47:19.288]  And so remember that when you're cheering Schwarzenegger on for President, when you're worshipping him at the RNC, as I witnessed.
[02:47:21.115 --> 02:47:23.596]  You know, let's be congruent here.
[02:47:25.097 --> 02:47:25.937]  Oh, what's the term?
[02:47:26.717 --> 02:47:29.959]  Let's be consistent.
[02:47:31.339 --> 02:47:33.080]  Let's fight for all the others they're killing.
[02:47:33.340 --> 02:47:34.961]  Let's fight against abortion.
[02:47:35.621 --> 02:47:36.721]  Want to save some lives?
[02:47:37.422 --> 02:47:41.323]  Let's save lives, not just Terry's, but the lives that nobody wants to talk about.
[02:47:41.824 --> 02:47:43.484]  The stuff that goes on under the radar.
[02:47:43.504 --> 02:47:47.746]  Let's get beneath the radar, outside the box, and see the big picture.
[02:47:49.427 --> 02:47:50.127]  Let's discuss that.
[02:47:50.868 --> 02:47:52.169]  I did a pretty good job this hour.
[02:47:52.209 --> 02:47:53.749]  I think I took about 15 calls.
[02:47:56.210 --> 02:47:58.831]  We'll try to maybe take some more coming up.
[02:47:58.871 --> 02:48:00.592]  I mean, I used to take 15 calls in a show.
[02:48:00.652 --> 02:48:04.093]  I'm getting better at going to your calls and we're going to continue doing this.
[02:48:04.113 --> 02:48:06.534]  I don't know.
[02:48:06.594 --> 02:48:11.836]  I get zero direction for this broadcast from the folks running the network, which is why I'm on this network, which is always good.
[02:48:11.876 --> 02:48:17.939]  But I do enjoy taking your calls and that's always the high point of my day.
[02:48:19.471 --> 02:48:22.572]  We'll come back, depressed and close to quitting over UN scandals.
[02:48:22.592 --> 02:48:23.973]  We'll also talk about these earthquakes.
[02:48:26.374 --> 02:48:31.856]  At record frequency and severity of earth pains.
[02:48:33.317 --> 02:48:34.438]  The sun heating up.
[02:48:35.938 --> 02:48:37.979]  Ejecting more radiation in the form of heat.
[02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:42.281]  Looks like it's going to get rougher before it gets better.
[02:48:46.374 --> 02:48:47.935]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:48.095 --> 02:48:51.157]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.297 --> 02:48:55.179]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:55.239 --> 02:48:59.461]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.822 --> 02:49:03.584]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.664 --> 02:49:05.545]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:06.125 --> 02:49:09.048]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:09.088 --> 02:49:13.792]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.952 --> 02:49:16.995]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:17.175 --> 02:49:20.037]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.518 --> 02:49:26.643]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:27.163 --> 02:49:30.967]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:51:47.221 --> 02:51:50.304]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[02:51:53.055 --> 02:51:55.398]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:55.679 --> 02:51:59.504]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central on your local AM and FM affiliates.
[02:51:59.544 --> 02:52:01.166]  Want to thank all those great folks out there.
[02:52:02.008 --> 02:52:04.892]  And on Global Shortwave at night, 3210 during the day, 9.985.
[02:52:04.932 --> 02:52:10.159]  And the internet at infowars.com and Prison Planet.
[02:52:10.945 --> 02:52:15.629]  I'm just going to have time to talk to one more caller, Diane in South Carolina.
[02:52:15.970 --> 02:52:17.671]  Diane in South Carolina, go ahead.
[02:52:18.092 --> 02:52:31.263]  You know, Bush's administration is using this intentional atmosphere of creating hate, not only of the United States, but of the Christian groups and the liberal groups, because he's doing a lot of this in the name of God, and we all know it's not God.
[02:52:31.283 --> 02:52:32.605]  Yeah, balkanization, yeah.
[02:52:33.085 --> 02:52:34.006]  But my question is,
[02:52:34.477 --> 02:52:40.641]  When the federal government did the Disabilities Act, why did that not give them power to go in and help carry it out?
[02:52:40.661 --> 02:52:42.822]  See, they're selectively setting the precedent.
[02:52:42.842 --> 02:52:47.845]  They've been creeping around in the shadows doing it for a long time, of killing people who aren't in a vegetative state.
[02:52:48.605 --> 02:52:50.667]  And you shouldn't kill somebody in a vegetative state to begin with.
[02:52:50.947 --> 02:52:51.207]  I know.
[02:52:51.307 --> 02:52:52.107]  One more question.
[02:52:52.488 --> 02:52:55.590]  Is there any way we can pay by phone to use your internet?
[02:52:55.630 --> 02:52:57.891]  Because a lot of us don't use stuff over the internet.
[02:52:58.991 --> 02:53:00.411]  You're talking about PrisonPlanet.tv?
[02:53:00.431 --> 02:53:01.412]  Correct, correct.
[02:53:01.432 --> 02:53:02.732]  Is there any way we can pay by phone?
[02:53:02.752 --> 02:53:06.153]  Well, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, uh, you know, I think we could do that.
[02:53:06.533 --> 02:53:15.376]  I think you could maybe call up my office and we could mail a check and then we could mail you back a passcode to PrisonPlanet.tv, but ma'am, we don't sell names.
[02:53:15.896 --> 02:53:20.698]  It's totally private with a secure, certified... Oh, I'm not worried about that.
[02:53:20.738 --> 02:53:24.919]  I'm worried about them getting told our visa numbers again, because a lot of us have been pinned before.
[02:53:25.019 --> 02:53:26.660]  But ma'am, that happens from hacks.
[02:53:27.020 --> 02:53:27.221]  Uh huh.
[02:53:33.735 --> 02:53:35.336]  You see, that goes over the phone lines.
[02:53:35.616 --> 02:53:38.017]  I've been dying to get your site.
[02:53:38.077 --> 02:53:39.718]  Ma'am, let me tell you something.
[02:53:39.738 --> 02:53:42.940]  A lot of those employees are taking those numbers and selling them.
[02:53:43.400 --> 02:53:48.743]  Most of the fraud, the mainstream media doesn't like the internet, so they demonize the internet.
[02:53:49.003 --> 02:53:55.646]  The internet, statistically, with cashless payments, is safer than going to a store.
[02:53:55.906 --> 02:53:58.788]  Well, that's where mom got hit, was at a university bookstore.
[02:53:59.128 --> 02:54:00.008]  See, I told you.
[02:54:00.628 --> 02:54:01.989]  I've got the actual statistics.
[02:54:02.089 --> 02:54:02.869]  It's not true.
[02:54:03.189 --> 02:54:06.530]  We have a secure, certified server.
[02:54:06.710 --> 02:54:07.550]  Very hard to get.
[02:54:07.570 --> 02:54:10.651]  Secure, secure server.
[02:54:10.911 --> 02:54:18.472]  That doesn't mean there isn't some hacker that couldn't break in there, but it's 15 times harder than somebody over a phone line at a bank.
[02:54:18.512 --> 02:54:19.073]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:19.733 --> 02:54:20.713]  I really appreciate your call.
[02:54:21.354 --> 02:54:22.535]  CrimsonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:22.635 --> 02:54:23.795]  Or use PayPal, ma'am!
[02:54:24.336 --> 02:54:26.997]  Get credits on PayPal, and it's not even... then you're through PayPal.
[02:54:27.017 --> 02:54:28.898]  What are you talking about being secure?
[02:54:29.718 --> 02:54:30.619]  Don't trust us.
[02:54:30.659 --> 02:54:32.920]  Go buy creds with PayPal and do it.
[02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:34.361]  Alright.
[02:54:35.721 --> 02:54:36.462]  Ah, man.
[02:54:36.822 --> 02:54:37.842]  I'm almost out of time here.
[02:54:37.882 --> 02:54:38.503]  I've got to hurry.
[02:54:39.283 --> 02:54:42.365]  Depressed Annan close to quitting over UN scandals.
[02:54:42.425 --> 02:54:48.768]  Coffee Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, is said to be struggling with depression and considering his future.
[02:54:49.853 --> 02:54:51.974]  By the way, I don't like to use credit cards at stores.
[02:54:52.054 --> 02:54:52.654]  I use cash.
[02:54:53.335 --> 02:55:04.620]  Colleagues have reported concerns about Annan ahead of an official report this week that will examine his son Kojo's connection to the controversial issue of oil for food scheme.
[02:55:05.260 --> 02:55:10.223]  And Bill Clinton's got seven of the G8, this has been in mainstream papers, lined up.
[02:55:10.283 --> 02:55:11.863]  He wants to be Secretary General.
[02:55:12.264 --> 02:55:17.066]  We'll probably end up with Bill Clinton as Secretary General in the next few years.
[02:55:18.835 --> 02:55:21.136]  And then we got Wolfowitz at the World Bank.
[02:55:22.576 --> 02:55:24.517]  Then we're going to have, obviously, Lord Bush.
[02:55:25.858 --> 02:55:30.659]  So they'll play the whole fake left-right paradigm from both ends of the spectrum.
[02:55:30.999 --> 02:55:34.421]  Hundreds have died in the Indonesian quake, BBC reports.
[02:55:34.881 --> 02:55:40.983]  Hundreds of people are believed to have died in Indonesia after a massive earthquake that triggered tsunami alerts around the Indian Ocean.
[02:55:41.023 --> 02:55:42.424]  But it wasn't water that killed them.
[02:55:43.084 --> 02:55:43.284]  It was
[02:55:44.019 --> 02:55:52.409]  Collapsing buildings, it was felt as far away as Malaysia and Singapore, and thousands fled their homes across the region, still reeling from Decembers of devastating tsunami.
[02:55:52.970 --> 02:55:55.513]  If I was you, I wouldn't go vacation over there anytime soon.
[02:55:56.895 --> 02:56:00.059]  And I've got the report here from the U.S.
[02:56:00.099 --> 02:56:01.320]  Geological Survey and others.
[02:56:01.841 --> 02:56:02.442]  Earthquakes.
[02:56:03.257 --> 02:56:09.619]  In the past 24 hours, a record level, and in the last year, a record level for all recorded history.
[02:56:09.979 --> 02:56:12.480]  I mean, 9.2s are mega massive.
[02:56:12.881 --> 02:56:17.322]  This one was an 8.7, which is mega.
[02:56:17.622 --> 02:56:20.583]  Again, we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:56:20.643 --> 02:56:21.584]  God bless you all.
[02:56:21.644 --> 02:56:22.544]  Thanks for your support.
[02:56:23.004 --> 02:56:28.186]  Now get out there in the info war and take on the New World Order, because there is a war on for your mind.
[02:56:28.906 --> 02:56:30.887]  My new film, Martial Law, is out.
[02:56:31.727 --> 02:56:33.008]  Pray for Terry Schindler.
