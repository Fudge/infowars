[00:00:05.739 --> 00:00:06.400]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.121]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:09.922]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.583 --> 00:00:11.404]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.164 --> 00:00:13.065]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:17.408]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:21.972]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.822 --> 00:00:39.165]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:39.346 --> 00:00:43.410]  It is Friday, the third day of June 2005.
[00:00:43.911 --> 00:00:47.174]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:47.375 --> 00:00:48.416]  Wide open phones.
[00:00:48.456 --> 00:00:54.763]  And I'm going to go to your calls quickly and in rapid succession have your comments, your questions, the news items.
[00:00:55.447 --> 00:01:00.931]  You wish you discuss ready and we will go to you early in the next segment.
[00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:03.793]  Toll free number to join us 1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:03.813 --> 00:01:03.853]  U.S.
[00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:08.556]  offers to turn on water electricity if residents inform on resistance to U.S.
[00:01:08.576 --> 00:01:09.057]  occupation.
[00:01:25.535 --> 00:01:26.636]  The Soviets would do this.
[00:01:26.676 --> 00:01:31.941]  They'd go in and turn off power, water, food, until people, quote, went along with them.
[00:01:31.961 --> 00:01:36.846]  And we know this is part of the FEMA plan here in the United States.
[00:01:37.046 --> 00:01:42.771]  On the books, we've got in the documents, for the takeover of this country and to get you to turn in your firearms.
[00:01:43.732 --> 00:01:46.195]  But again, turning your firearms in is conservative.
[00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:49.338]  Fighting for the Second Amendment is evil and liberal.
[00:01:50.584 --> 00:01:52.324]  Open door on Patriot Act.
[00:01:52.344 --> 00:02:00.426]  Well, we've all been busy watching the distraction over the Senate not confirming Bush's nominees.
[00:02:01.907 --> 00:02:05.708]  They've been busy marking it up to pass it and expanding it massively.
[00:02:06.168 --> 00:02:08.368]  So we'll go over that as well.
[00:02:08.648 --> 00:02:15.150]  And finally, people are starting to pay attention to the Simpson-Brenner snitch or go to jail bill.
[00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:24.313]  Why, if we couldn't even show any evidence that you knew somebody was using illegal drugs and you didn't tell us, you're gonna get a whole bunch of years in jail!
[00:02:24.373 --> 00:02:25.353]  How's that sound?
[00:02:25.393 --> 00:02:27.274]  And a giant fine!
[00:02:27.294 --> 00:02:29.155]  You've all got a tattle for us!
[00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:33.137]  Or you're in deep trouble if you use any of the drugs we ship in!
[00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:35.838]  Or if your neighbor uses any that we ship in!
[00:02:36.744 --> 00:02:45.470]  You're going to our private prison that we own, and you're going to work for us for 20 cents an hour, and the idiot public's going to cheer it, because they love losing their jobs to you.
[00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.012]  They love competing against 20 cents an hour.
[00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:51.894]  That even makes the illegal aliens look good in comparison.
[00:02:52.155 --> 00:02:53.696]  They'll work for 4 bucks an hour.
[00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:55.917]  How about 20 cents an hour?
[00:02:56.297 --> 00:03:02.001]  That's why some illegals, we still have massive levels of them pouring in, but it's slowed down a bit.
[00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:05.924]  Because they're even having trouble in this wonderful economy.
[00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:08.197]  Oh, it's so good!
[00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:10.518]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:03:10.618 --> 00:03:13.579]  Israeli troops admit an eye-for-an-eye killings report.
[00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:20.581]  If someone kills an Israeli soldier, they just randomly go splatter a woman or a child or a man.
[00:03:21.562 --> 00:03:23.583]  And, you know, the Nazis did that.
[00:03:25.143 --> 00:03:27.144]  Well, in all fairness, the Nazis.
[00:03:27.864 --> 00:03:32.266]  If you shot one German soldier, they'd line 20 people up and kill them.
[00:03:33.332 --> 00:03:38.116]  in the towns, and the Russians first held them as saviors, but that backfired on them.
[00:03:38.757 --> 00:03:45.602]  It backfired on them in Poland, it backfired on them in Russia, but the Israelis are doing it now.
[00:03:45.763 --> 00:04:01.816]  Israeli Special Forces killed 15 Palestinians, including police, at a 2002 shooting spree, ordered to avenge comrades, ordered, slain in the West Bank ambush, an Israeli newspaper said Friday, citing testimony by troops.
[00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:11.387]  And they go on to say they just, um, they don't just, quote, hunt down all those involved in terror activities, uh, they just go around shooting people.
[00:04:15.388 --> 00:04:23.190]  In one case, there was a group of Palestinian policemen drinking coffee at a checkpoint near where the Israeli soldiers had been ambushed, and the Israeli troops just came in and killed them.
[00:04:25.051 --> 00:04:27.012]  And our troops are doing the same thing in Iraq.
[00:04:27.052 --> 00:04:31.333]  If they even get shot at from a village, they bulldoze the entire village and all the crops.
[00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.131]  And then they suddenly got massive insurgency!
[00:04:36.773 --> 00:04:43.618]  I mean, this never works in history and not going to work here is going to do the exact opposite.
[00:04:43.638 --> 00:04:46.400]  Of course, our government, the Israeli government, knows that.
[00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:48.122]  They want to widen the conflict.
[00:04:48.242 --> 00:04:50.243]  Endless war for a state of emergency.
[00:04:51.384 --> 00:04:54.647]  A judge has ordered the release of new Abu Ghraib videos and photos.
[00:04:55.187 --> 00:04:56.569]  The torture scandal deepens.
[00:04:56.849 --> 00:04:58.270]  The whitewash intensifies.
[00:05:01.323 --> 00:05:05.646]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.846 --> 00:05:10.269]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.792]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.812 --> 00:05:16.173]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.953 --> 00:05:22.174]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.234 --> 00:05:29.175]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.295 --> 00:05:31.376]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.656 --> 00:05:42.138]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.298 --> 00:05:43.538]  If you want to understand what the new
[00:05:43.558 --> 00:05:43.758]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:45.299]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:06:00.882 --> 00:06:01.643]  Terrorism!
[00:06:01.783 --> 00:06:02.563]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.643 --> 00:06:08.727]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:08.967 --> 00:06:10.568]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:10.808 --> 00:06:13.290]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:28.239]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.599]  government.
[00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:30.560]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.864]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:37.024 --> 00:06:41.507]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video, Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:41.747 --> 00:06:47.370]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.111]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.131 --> 00:06:51.173]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.632]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:07:06.792 --> 00:07:07.853]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:07:07.973 --> 00:07:08.833]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:07:08.953 --> 00:07:11.794]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:07:11.974 --> 00:07:16.856]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:07:17.096 --> 00:07:18.196]  Check out this new product.
[00:07:18.356 --> 00:07:21.237]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:07:21.617 --> 00:07:25.319]  I know, you're wondering, how do you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:25.639]  Look.
[00:07:25.819 --> 00:07:28.141]  The creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.
[00:07:28.221 --> 00:07:33.045]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:07:33.325 --> 00:07:36.447]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[00:07:36.567 --> 00:07:41.992]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:07:42.072 --> 00:07:42.832]  Try No-BO.
[00:07:42.952 --> 00:07:43.933]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:07:45.114 --> 00:07:47.995]  No-BO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[00:07:48.175 --> 00:07:51.056]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-BO.
[00:07:51.256 --> 00:07:53.717]  Check out their website at NO-BO.com.
[00:07:53.877 --> 00:07:58.939]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-BO at NO-BO.com.
[00:08:05.881 --> 00:08:06.521]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.202 --> 00:08:08.142]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:10.047]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.707 --> 00:08:11.568]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.288 --> 00:08:13.789]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:17.791]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.031 --> 00:08:22.153]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.515 --> 00:08:28.517]  Alright, second segment, eight minutes, twenty-five seconds into this transmission.
[00:08:28.577 --> 00:08:30.378]  It is Friday, the third day of June 2005.
[00:08:30.438 --> 00:08:35.501]  You know, I'm just not getting used to saying 2005.
[00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:37.362]  We're already halfway into the year.
[00:08:39.258 --> 00:08:41.439]  Time really accelerates as you get older.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:50.325]  I always heard that when I was a child and time crawled by so slowly and now the years are like pages of a book just lapping past me.
[00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:54.207]  I know that's what you're experiencing as well.
[00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:54.788]  It's interesting.
[00:08:55.588 --> 00:08:59.571]  A massive news we're going to be going over and of course wide open phones today.
[00:08:59.631 --> 00:09:01.072]  A ton of your phone calls coming up.
[00:09:01.132 --> 00:09:02.973]  Tom and David and Jeff and Ed and Nelson.
[00:09:03.453 --> 00:09:05.915]  Everybody your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:09:07.418 --> 00:09:11.760]  I want to get into some of the tactics that the Israeli troops and the U.S.
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:19.284]  troops are engaging in in the Middle East that are designed to backfire and continue the conflict.
[00:09:19.304 --> 00:09:24.507]  I want to get into the latest developments with the expanded, jumbo, supersized Patriot Act.
[00:09:25.248 --> 00:09:31.171]  The torture scandal is deepening radically, and as I said earlier, the whitewash is intensifying.
[00:09:32.665 --> 00:09:35.786]  The websites are all freshly updated for you on a daily basis.
[00:09:35.826 --> 00:09:40.707]  They're InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:09:41.987 --> 00:09:48.429]  We're about to radically expand JonesReport.com and redesign InfoWars.com here in the next month, so look for that.
[00:09:49.969 --> 00:09:55.810]  Just a note about my showings of Martial Law at the Alamo Draft House Cinema in downtown Austin.
[00:09:57.130 --> 00:09:59.351]  They were both sold out yesterday.
[00:10:01.044 --> 00:10:06.186]  Well, the first showing was already sold out before that, and then the second showing sold out yesterday afternoon.
[00:10:07.726 --> 00:10:17.890]  Last time I checked, the Wednesday showing at the Alamo Draft House South Lamar was just a few tickets short of selling out, even in their biggest theater.
[00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.771]  I haven't checked it this morning.
[00:10:21.811 --> 00:10:24.092]  I have a sneaking suspicion it's probably sold out.
[00:10:24.152 --> 00:10:26.413]  You can go over to Infowars.com and link through.
[00:10:27.296 --> 00:10:29.957]  Down at the Alamo Draft House, and it should tell you if it's been sold out.
[00:10:30.557 --> 00:10:44.002]  So, we couldn't have another showing next week because they were already booked up, but we're going to have one more showing after that on Thursday, June 16th at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar.
[00:10:44.103 --> 00:10:52.946]  A fourth showing for all of you that, and God bless you, I'm glad you want to go to the showings, that didn't listen to me and didn't buy tickets early.
[00:10:55.084 --> 00:10:59.546]  I still would love to see you, love to meet you, and I'll be at all four of these events.
[00:10:59.566 --> 00:11:06.669]  The two events tonight, the single event next Wednesday, and this other showing the next Thursday, June 16th.
[00:11:06.689 --> 00:11:14.192]  But I recommend that you go to InfoWars.com and link through to that June 16th showing and go ahead and get your tickets.
[00:11:14.212 --> 00:11:17.314]  730, and that will be June 16th, so that gives you 13 days.
[00:11:21.307 --> 00:11:25.608]  To do that, but I have a sneaking suspicion that that'll sell out long before.
[00:11:25.628 --> 00:11:27.269]  I mean, you can just forget getting tickets at the door.
[00:11:27.789 --> 00:11:35.671]  In fact, I was talking to the folks that run the movie theater chain, and they were saying, man, we ought to have these in all our theaters, and, you know, show them for a few weeks.
[00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:41.393]  Because people want to... People instinctively know martial laws gearing up in this country.
[00:11:41.673 --> 00:11:43.013]  They know 9-11's a fraud.
[00:11:43.053 --> 00:11:48.535]  They know we're in a police state, and they want to see the films, so... A little bit frustrating,
[00:11:49.352 --> 00:11:53.735]  And I'm sorry for those that were planning to come down tonight, but it's completely sold out.
[00:11:55.156 --> 00:12:05.843]  And I'm sure a few people that bought tickets won't show up, so if you wanted to stand there in line and hope that somebody didn't claim their tickets and get in, you could, but I don't really recommend that.
[00:12:06.083 --> 00:12:08.464]  Oh, and here's another thing.
[00:12:08.484 --> 00:12:18.851]  I don't blame the Alamo Draft House for this, but I told them a week ago that I was going to have about 15 guests, so hold back about 15 tickets for the first showing.
[00:12:19.904 --> 00:12:20.685]  They didn't do it.
[00:12:21.285 --> 00:12:23.226]  So now, I don't even have a seat.
[00:12:24.547 --> 00:12:26.288]  I'm sure somebody won't show up and I'll get a seat.
[00:12:27.188 --> 00:12:30.050]  I don't even have a seat tonight for the movie.
[00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:32.511]  I do have a seat for the 10 o'clock.
[00:12:33.392 --> 00:12:38.415]  I mean, right before it sold out, I was able to grab enough seats for my guests that are coming.
[00:12:38.455 --> 00:12:40.216]  So I apologize to my guests.
[00:12:41.351 --> 00:12:46.632]  You're welcome to come and maybe get a folding chair or sit on my shoulders or something.
[00:12:47.652 --> 00:12:52.793]  I mean, really, the event will be just hanging out and meeting all the great folks that hate the New World Order and love freedom.
[00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:56.854]  So, again, that is coming up tonight.
[00:12:56.874 --> 00:13:02.055]  But for all my guests who I've been trying to call, you've got seats at the 10 o'clock showing this evening.
[00:13:02.075 --> 00:13:03.435]  And I'm sorry if that screws you up.
[00:13:03.515 --> 00:13:04.195]  It's not my fault.
[00:13:06.376 --> 00:13:07.116]  Very frustrating.
[00:13:08.582 --> 00:13:08.922]  U.S.
[00:13:09.082 --> 00:13:16.968]  offers to turn on water electricity if residents inform on resistance to U.S.
[00:13:17.148 --> 00:13:18.389]  occupation forces.
[00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:19.009]  U.S.
[00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:26.114]  occupation forces announced on their propaganda radio, beamed at local residents at the R Ramadi, that the U.S.
[00:13:26.134 --> 00:13:33.539]  military would stop raiding houses and mosques, would open roads to local people, and turn the electricity and drinking water supply
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:45.989]  in the city back on if local residents would cooperate by informing the American occupation troops of the locations and bases of Iraqi resistance fighters operating in the city against Americans.
[00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:53.515]  Now again, the Soviets tried this, the Germans tried this, the Japanese tried this in China and the Philippines.
[00:13:54.355 --> 00:13:55.997]  It never works.
[00:13:57.054 --> 00:14:03.837]  What happens is, resistance fighters, as they're calling them, simply report on people that are loyal to the U.S.
[00:14:03.897 --> 00:14:06.318]  Occupation Forces, and then our troops go and arrest them.
[00:14:08.879 --> 00:14:15.522]  Or somebody who is in business against, you know, the guy across the street, he simply calls the U.S.
[00:14:15.562 --> 00:14:16.963]  Forces and they come pick him up.
[00:14:17.123 --> 00:14:23.526]  Or he's having an affair with his neighbor's wife, and the neighbor has cussed him out, so he calls the police on him.
[00:14:24.682 --> 00:14:27.544]  This is what happens in police states, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:29.165 --> 00:14:30.526]  That's what makes them so bad.
[00:14:31.306 --> 00:14:49.757]  One of the really bad facets to it is that it's used as a tool by local local thugs and local viceroys, local corrupt mayors as their own little iron fist to expand their own business opportunities and activities to rob and rule and loot the people.
[00:14:51.618 --> 00:14:52.919]  And this is only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:14:53.983 --> 00:15:01.110]  The American forces, controlled by the globalists, are poor troops over there breathing depleted uranium openly.
[00:15:01.130 --> 00:15:02.372]  I mean, it's been all over national TV.
[00:15:02.392 --> 00:15:03.373]  They're very proud of it.
[00:15:03.813 --> 00:15:09.899]  If somebody shoots at them... I mean, they've had examples where they come into a village of 3,000 people.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:14.504]  Somebody from a date grove shoots at their tank.
[00:15:16.112 --> 00:15:34.239]  They then call in bulldozers, bulldoze the entire date grove, bulldoze the tangerine plantations, bulldoze the areas where they're growing wheat, bulldoze a bunch of houses, burn some houses down, and arrest every person down to 11 years of age, and put them in one of the 32 camps.
[00:15:34.699 --> 00:15:37.240]  They got over 10,000 people at Abu Ghraib alone, folks.
[00:15:37.621 --> 00:15:38.141]  Abu Ghraib.
[00:15:41.602 --> 00:15:42.302]  It's horrible!
[00:15:45.942 --> 00:15:49.323]  The poor Iraqi people were 25 million in 1991.
[00:15:50.764 --> 00:15:54.345]  Guess how many Iraqis there are now?
[00:15:54.365 --> 00:15:54.805]  22 million.
[00:15:55.905 --> 00:16:03.788]  Now they say that a million and a half died up from the start of the sanctions in late 90s up until 2003 with the invasion.
[00:16:04.948 --> 00:16:06.209]  Since then another 200 to 300 thousand but
[00:16:09.227 --> 00:16:15.968]  Once the liberation, in quotes, took place at the end of the major military operations, the U.S.
[00:16:16.008 --> 00:16:24.670]  government publicly ordered the Iraqi puppet government, the provisional government, to stop collecting deaths statistics.
[00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:30.091]  For some reason I couldn't pronounce that.
[00:16:31.812 --> 00:16:32.632]  So we don't know.
[00:16:32.652 --> 00:16:37.673]  I mean, they don't count how many people die of cholera or cancer or anything.
[00:16:38.317 --> 00:16:42.420]  They just stopped collecting statistics, but the evidence is it's even accelerated worse.
[00:16:43.121 --> 00:16:56.972]  So, somewhere in the mix, a country's population that was booming up until 1990 is now down, ladies and gentlemen, by 3 million people!
[00:16:57.592 --> 00:16:57.973]  Poof!
[00:16:58.914 --> 00:16:59.334]  Gone!
[00:17:00.194 --> 00:17:03.115]  And our own government admits a million and a half.
[00:17:03.416 --> 00:17:06.157]  700,000 by 97 of them were children.
[00:17:06.597 --> 00:17:18.143]  And in 1997, Madeleine Albright, again to enrage the Arabs, part of a long-term strategic plan, very sophisticated, on NBC they said 700,000 children have starved to death and died.
[00:17:18.163 --> 00:17:19.143]  Is that a good price to pay?
[00:17:19.183 --> 00:17:21.084]  And she said, yes, it's a good price to pay.
[00:17:21.404 --> 00:17:22.345]  She didn't deny it.
[00:17:22.845 --> 00:17:23.525]  She didn't know.
[00:17:23.825 --> 00:17:29.228]  And that was beamed all over the world by CNN and rebroadcast on Arab TV stations.
[00:17:31.169 --> 00:17:34.710]  And the Arabs go absolutely ape, which is exactly what the globalists want.
[00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.731]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:17:37.771 --> 00:17:39.591]  Let's talk to Tom in Maryland.
[00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:40.332]  Tom, go ahead.
[00:17:40.692 --> 00:17:41.872]  Hi, Alex.
[00:17:42.112 --> 00:17:54.815]  I wanted to say, I start off every time I call you by telling you how great your latest films are, and Martial Law, and The Rise of the Police State film, I do believe, are your best work.
[00:17:55.556 --> 00:18:00.357]  And I really enjoyed the David Gergen confrontation and Michael Moore confrontation.
[00:18:01.189 --> 00:18:08.297]  More than anything else, probably your confrontation with the communists who seem brainless.
[00:18:09.038 --> 00:18:14.023]  They really showed themselves on your film for what they are.
[00:18:14.043 --> 00:18:19.029]  The young kids couldn't even tell you, couldn't even speak for themselves and articulate their
[00:18:19.713 --> 00:18:21.535]  Their so-called views.
[00:18:21.595 --> 00:18:26.439]  They couldn't even... They said, uh, you'll have to talk to our spokesperson.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:37.690]  And Alex was also very rudely treated by these people, and that's what, uh, I think really shows you the mentality of the people that entertain those kind of beliefs.
[00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.533]  And I think it would have been very appropriate for you to ask the...
[00:18:41.774 --> 00:18:46.357]  Nasty old man who was being very rude to you and saying, putting words into your mouth.
[00:18:46.377 --> 00:18:50.861]  Well no, he was claiming to the crowd that I had just said mean things to them and that wasn't true.
[00:18:51.421 --> 00:19:00.648]  Right, and that was very obvious and he showed himself to be just an agitator, but I think it would have been very appropriate to ask him, sir, do you own any private property?
[00:19:00.708 --> 00:19:05.692]  Because according to communist philosophy, there shouldn't be any and nobody should be allowed to have it.
[00:19:05.732 --> 00:19:09.635]  Well, only the oligarchs that control the country have the property.
[00:19:10.752 --> 00:19:11.453]  Exactly.
[00:19:11.673 --> 00:19:15.375]  Well, the reason I put them in the film is, I mean, I wasn't going to make a film about communists.
[00:19:15.716 --> 00:19:16.536]  No, I understand that.
[00:19:16.556 --> 00:19:21.019]  But they were such idiots, and they were so vicious, you know, one of them said, too bad Stalin didn't kill you.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.821]  I remember hearing that, yes.
[00:19:23.021 --> 00:19:30.606]  Yeah, because they're right behind me as I'm videotaping the other one, and the lady walks up and says it, and we have our other cameraman who's a witness to her saying it, and you can hear her say it, and then she wouldn't answer questions.
[00:19:30.626 --> 00:19:31.287]  But the point is,
[00:19:32.219 --> 00:19:42.287]  about this is that we do, we show it in the film so somebody watching understands we're not left-wing or right-wing, we're criticizing Michael Moore, George Bush, the communist.
[00:19:43.047 --> 00:19:45.429]  I tell you what, stay there.
[00:19:45.689 --> 00:19:46.109]  Just stay there.
[00:19:46.129 --> 00:19:52.814]  I'll let you finish up, Tom, and then we'll go to David, Jeff, Ed, Nelson, and many others on the other side of this quick break.
[00:19:53.435 --> 00:19:55.216]  The transmission shall continue.
[00:20:02.353 --> 00:20:09.234]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:20:09.774 --> 00:20:15.195]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:15.595 --> 00:20:25.617]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:28.117]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:20:28.477 --> 00:20:31.518]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:20:31.998 --> 00:20:33.159]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:20:33.299 --> 00:20:36.181]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:20:36.462 --> 00:20:40.785]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:20:41.045 --> 00:20:42.787]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:20:43.107 --> 00:20:55.316]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at Drunkstore.com.
[00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:59.720]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:21:02.671 --> 00:21:07.172]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:07.532 --> 00:21:11.614]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:11.914 --> 00:21:12.454]  We listened.
[00:21:12.774 --> 00:21:17.755]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:18.035 --> 00:21:18.516]  We listened.
[00:21:18.876 --> 00:21:21.937]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:22.357 --> 00:21:22.877]  We listened.
[00:21:23.357 --> 00:21:26.498]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:21:26.738 --> 00:21:27.058]  I don't know.
[00:21:52.023 --> 00:21:52.644]  4438.
[00:21:52.083 --> 00:21:52.644]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[00:21:52.684 --> 00:21:53.866]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:53.906 --> 00:21:55.869]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:56.830]  The real money folks.
[00:22:09.622 --> 00:22:11.543]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:22:12.043 --> 00:22:13.024]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:22:13.104 --> 00:22:14.305]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:22:14.425 --> 00:22:14.965]  A 5% increase.
[00:22:15.565 --> 00:22:17.987]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:22:18.007 --> 00:22:21.188]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:22:30.876 --> 00:22:33.217]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[00:22:33.237 --> 00:22:36.518]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:22:37.118 --> 00:22:40.159]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:24:12.029 --> 00:24:16.772]  Jump right back into your crawls, get through a bunch of these, and then plunge back into the newest torture developments.
[00:24:17.192 --> 00:24:18.913]  Tom in Maryland, finish up what you were saying?
[00:24:19.953 --> 00:24:37.403]  Uh, yes, I would, uh, I would just like to conclude by saying, uh, a couple of your films that don't get talked about a whole lot, like, uh, Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, you can't really underestimate the power of that film, either, because you really do a great job showing how they hide all the money, your local government,
[00:24:37.973 --> 00:24:45.235]  And your interview with the former IRS agent was very, very interesting and revealing, to say the least.
[00:24:45.255 --> 00:24:49.536]  That's all I have to say, Alex, and I really appreciate you getting me on first.
[00:24:49.636 --> 00:24:50.276]  Thank you very much.
[00:24:50.296 --> 00:24:51.176]  Well, thank you, sir.
[00:24:51.636 --> 00:25:01.358]  Yes, Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports Exposed has the least production quality of any of my films.
[00:25:01.538 --> 00:25:04.379]  I mean, I put it together because it's important, and it's produced well.
[00:25:05.462 --> 00:25:10.246]  And it's an interview with Walter Berrien, an interview with Joe Bannister, and others.
[00:25:11.207 --> 00:25:13.949]  And we show the real set of books.
[00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:19.834]  What government does is it tells you it's broke, but they have a double set of books that's just overflowing.
[00:25:21.616 --> 00:25:25.959]  And then they won't fill potholes, or they won't pay for EMS, new radios.
[00:25:27.220 --> 00:25:28.682]  They'll cut the police pay.
[00:25:29.751 --> 00:25:36.236]  And they'll do this to agencies, to get the agencies to follow orders, and they'll say, well, if you go along with this reorganization, you'll get more money.
[00:25:36.997 --> 00:25:40.459]  They do that with the citizens, too, and then they always expand taxes.
[00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:42.941]  It's like they're saying every state has to have toll roads.
[00:25:43.201 --> 00:25:46.363]  There's no money, there's no gas money from the gas tax coming in.
[00:25:46.804 --> 00:25:52.928]  We're using 20, now it's 21 million barrels a day, compared to 15 million barrels just five, six years ago.
[00:25:54.269 --> 00:25:56.831]  The money coming in is just ultra-massive.
[00:25:57.586 --> 00:25:59.666]  And TxDOT documents from Texas came out.
[00:25:59.706 --> 00:26:04.727]  They've got just unbelievable reserves of just tens of billions of extra dollars.
[00:26:04.887 --> 00:26:05.827]  Everything's paid for.
[00:26:06.288 --> 00:26:09.368]  I mean, they could build many times more roads, but it says secret.
[00:26:09.988 --> 00:26:16.189]  Not for distribution, not for the public, for high-level management of TxDOT only.
[00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:20.390]  Highest... and that was in the States a few months ago.
[00:26:21.650 --> 00:26:23.210]  It's the same thing all over the country.
[00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:24.751]  Do not let the public know.
[00:26:24.851 --> 00:26:26.171]  Of course you don't want to let us know.
[00:26:27.009 --> 00:26:29.331]  No, there's no money from gas receipts.
[00:26:29.491 --> 00:26:32.514]  Oh no, just massive record amounts.
[00:26:34.455 --> 00:26:35.576]  And it's like Schwarzenegger.
[00:26:35.656 --> 00:26:42.121]  It just came out on Tuesday, the night before he goes to San Francisco to quote, fix a street.
[00:26:42.141 --> 00:26:43.422]  The street was totally perfect.
[00:26:43.983 --> 00:26:45.024]  Neighbors all witnessed it.
[00:26:45.404 --> 00:26:49.407]  A big crew comes out with jackhammers, destroys an entire lane.
[00:26:50.028 --> 00:26:51.669]  Jackhammers, giant holes.
[00:26:52.409 --> 00:26:54.490]  And then Arnold showed up, and I've got his quotes here.
[00:26:54.750 --> 00:26:55.971]  Look at how bad it is!
[00:26:56.011 --> 00:26:56.611]  Look at this!
[00:26:56.832 --> 00:26:58.232]  You can't even drive on this!
[00:26:58.993 --> 00:27:00.494]  Put the asphalt on!
[00:27:00.534 --> 00:27:01.834]  Yeah, give me the broom!
[00:27:01.854 --> 00:27:04.616]  And he sweeps the asphalt in and goes, ah-ha-ha!
[00:27:04.636 --> 00:27:10.119]  I mean, how many times did Hitler do that, you know, out there with the greater building roads, or digging with shovels?
[00:27:11.266 --> 00:27:12.667]  Just totally staged!
[00:27:13.188 --> 00:27:13.428]  See?
[00:27:13.448 --> 00:27:15.090]  Our roads are falling apart.
[00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.092]  Got to have a satellite tracker box.
[00:27:17.392 --> 00:27:19.414]  Got to have the new tax on fuel.
[00:27:19.674 --> 00:27:20.455]  Got to do it.
[00:27:20.915 --> 00:27:21.256]  See?
[00:27:21.336 --> 00:27:22.157]  Do what I want.
[00:27:22.237 --> 00:27:23.918]  It is no road!
[00:27:24.539 --> 00:27:25.100]  Nothing!
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:31.386]  People go, well, I guess, honey, we gotta... gotta put a transponder in our car now.
[00:27:32.206 --> 00:27:34.669]  By the way, that bill has passed the House.
[00:27:36.112 --> 00:27:38.334]  Here in Texas, it's going on all over the country, too.
[00:27:38.574 --> 00:27:44.959]  It's going to be in all our inspection stickers, but the session closed, so it didn't make it to the Senate.
[00:27:47.081 --> 00:27:48.602]  But that just shows what they're doing.
[00:27:49.803 --> 00:27:51.945]  A transponder in every inspection sticker.
[00:27:53.186 --> 00:27:58.250]  Read by the radio readers, they've already put up all over my state and at least 15 other states I know of.
[00:27:58.914 --> 00:28:01.858]  The readers are already up, boys and girls.
[00:28:02.118 --> 00:28:03.620]  They're ready to start taxing.
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:06.443]  Notice they build the infrastructure before they even tell you about it.
[00:28:07.704 --> 00:28:12.350]  By the way, I never saw a single mainstream news article about the transponders in Texas.
[00:28:12.430 --> 00:28:13.511]  We had to find the bill.
[00:28:14.132 --> 00:28:15.073]  We had to cover it.
[00:28:16.354 --> 00:28:17.596]  And there it is in the bill.
[00:28:18.797 --> 00:28:28.465]  Because if they told the public, hey, you're all about to get a transponder in your inspection sticker and we're going to tax you, people would absolutely grab pitchforks, including the cops.
[00:28:28.505 --> 00:28:28.865]  The cops?
[00:28:28.925 --> 00:28:29.786]  I've talked to cops.
[00:28:29.826 --> 00:28:30.586]  They don't want that.
[00:28:31.047 --> 00:28:31.987]  Nobody wants that!
[00:28:32.007 --> 00:28:37.051]  I mean, who wants to pay a couple thousand dollars extra a year to drive in the city?
[00:28:37.512 --> 00:28:39.373]  And a couple thousand to drive on the state roads?
[00:28:40.434 --> 00:28:42.495]  Alright, see, I said I wanted to go to calls, but I'm ranting.
[00:28:43.156 --> 00:28:44.097]  David in Boston.
[00:28:44.137 --> 00:28:44.837]  David, go ahead.
[00:28:45.698 --> 00:28:46.559]  Alex, how are you today?
[00:28:46.679 --> 00:28:46.899]  Good.
[00:28:48.028 --> 00:28:54.996]  Listen, the guy you had on yesterday, Chris, that you lively debated, don't ever have anybody on past three minutes like that.
[00:28:56.297 --> 00:28:58.239]  He's totally mindless, obviously.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:02.724]  But he really disagreed, and it was a substantive disagreement.
[00:29:03.539 --> 00:29:07.803]  It wasn't a provocateur call, or a stalker call, or an agent provocateur call.
[00:29:09.284 --> 00:29:12.027]  People would disagree legitimately.
[00:29:12.107 --> 00:29:15.670]  Yeah, you kept firing off points, and he was subjective about everything.
[00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:17.832]  Oh, I'm sorry, I don't have any knowledge of that.
[00:29:18.272 --> 00:29:19.653]  But here's what I do.
[00:29:19.733 --> 00:29:22.296]  I've debated people like that, and here's what I do now.
[00:29:22.476 --> 00:29:28.461]  I have an MP3 player, and I have the famous... First of all, I have the Silverstein quote.
[00:29:29.396 --> 00:29:43.521]  We blew up the buildings and I have the one about Bush who says, oh yeah, our primary goal is to hunt down Bin Laden, and then of course, oh no, well now we don't, I don't care where he is.
[00:29:44.522 --> 00:29:45.722]  I have the main quote.
[00:29:45.742 --> 00:29:47.103]  Stay there David, I'll let you finish up.
[00:29:47.123 --> 00:29:49.143]  Yeah, we played those clips here on air, they're very powerful.
[00:29:49.163 --> 00:29:50.684]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:54.965]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.985 --> 00:29:58.590]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:03.435 --> 00:31:14.137]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.518 --> 00:31:19.039]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:19.099 --> 00:31:30.442]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:31.042 --> 00:31:37.884]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:38.284 --> 00:31:40.425]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:40.905 --> 00:31:45.867]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:31:46.187 --> 00:31:52.496]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:31:57.823 --> 00:31:57.863]  888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.528 --> 00:32:03.209]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:05.389]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:32:05.609 --> 00:32:06.289]  Prepare yourself.
[00:32:06.469 --> 00:32:10.170]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[00:32:34.242 --> 00:32:35.022]  Which are collectible?
[00:32:35.062 --> 00:32:35.803]  Which are bullion?
[00:32:35.863 --> 00:32:38.004]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.

[00:33:04.222 --> 00:33:10.246]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.846 --> 00:33:13.808]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:18.131 --> 00:33:21.693]  During the break, my sneaking suspicion was confirmed.
[00:33:21.893 --> 00:33:24.555]  Next Wednesday's show sold out last night.
[00:33:26.403 --> 00:33:30.746]  So all three showings of Martial Law, the two coming up tonight and the one next week, are sold out.
[00:33:31.206 --> 00:33:38.570]  So we've added another showing the next Thursday, June 16th, 7.30 p.m., Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[00:33:38.590 --> 00:33:42.833]  For those of you that were disappointed, that procrastinated, please come out to that event.
[00:33:42.913 --> 00:33:46.194]  I want a chance to meet you and show the film.
[00:33:46.214 --> 00:33:50.417]  This will definitely be the last time we'll show it for quite a while.
[00:33:50.477 --> 00:33:52.078]  I mean, in six months I might show it again.
[00:33:53.416 --> 00:33:55.596]  That's what I did with Road to Tyranny.
[00:33:55.676 --> 00:33:56.657]  I showed it a couple times.
[00:33:57.677 --> 00:34:01.057]  There's a good chance I'll show it in San Antonio, Houston, and Dallas.
[00:34:01.898 --> 00:34:06.639]  Just because I've gotten so many requests to do that, so I might be traveling about the state.
[00:34:07.099 --> 00:34:08.619]  That's something I can easily do.
[00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:13.640]  It's hard for me to travel outside Texas, though I do do that a few times a year on news stories.
[00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.001]  I'll go to D.C., I'll go to New York, I'll go to L.A.
[00:34:18.241 --> 00:34:18.881]  for a story.
[00:34:19.934 --> 00:34:28.237]  Or some event, but those folks know I don't travel a lot because I have weighed the advantages of fighting the New World Order.
[00:34:28.277 --> 00:34:29.117]  What's more effective?
[00:34:29.737 --> 00:34:42.341]  I can jump on a plane, fly to some conspiracy conference, talk to 2,000 people who already know what's going on, or I can do five radio interviews a day, which I've been doing about five a day the last month or so.
[00:34:42.401 --> 00:34:43.922]  It's been heating back up.
[00:34:44.482 --> 00:34:44.922]  I mean, I can
[00:34:46.116 --> 00:34:49.718]  Reach millions of people a day just on other talk shows, not even my own.
[00:34:50.478 --> 00:34:59.403]  And expose the New World Order, or I can... I know so many people that love to travel because at a primitive level, they love to interface with crowds.
[00:34:59.963 --> 00:35:03.145]  They love that physical connection.
[00:35:03.165 --> 00:35:07.887]  And quite frankly, it's because a lot of them are on power trips and just get off on it.
[00:35:07.907 --> 00:35:13.990]  I mean, I know people who go on a talk show and they're talking to a million people, conservatively.
[00:35:15.536 --> 00:35:22.038]  And their ho-hum, I gotta go, I can only do 30 minutes, but they will puff up and freak out in front of a crowd of 400.
[00:35:23.498 --> 00:35:32.701]  Whereas, I'll fall asleep giving a speech to a crowd, but I get all excited getting on the radio knowing that I'm reaching millions of people.
[00:35:33.982 --> 00:35:38.623]  But again, that's because people consciously go off what their eyes see and what they're witnessing.
[00:35:40.898 --> 00:35:42.719]  I like meeting people.
[00:35:42.779 --> 00:35:46.500]  I enjoy it, but only so much because I get exhausted.
[00:35:46.520 --> 00:35:50.822]  I fight the New World Order on average about 16 hours a day.
[00:35:50.842 --> 00:35:54.704]  I just get burned out sometimes.
[00:35:57.105 --> 00:35:59.306]  So I do these events, but I do them sparingly.
[00:35:59.866 --> 00:36:01.387]  I always enjoy them.
[00:36:01.747 --> 00:36:03.627]  I just always need a few days to recover.
[00:36:04.228 --> 00:36:09.250]  You talk to 500 people individually, it's very tiring.
[00:36:10.386 --> 00:36:26.973]  The tiredest I've ever been was they had a preparedness expo up in Mesquite, Texas I went to and there were about a thousand people there and I probably talked to 800 of them in two days and I sat at the table the whole time and I talked to people and it was like being interrogated.
[00:36:27.938 --> 00:36:40.611]  You know, all these nice folks, but so intense with their information, and give me an answer on this, and please read this, and please read that, and I literally walked into my hotel room that first night and collapsed onto the bed.
[00:36:42.518 --> 00:36:44.679]  I think that's why green rooms were invented.
[00:36:45.599 --> 00:36:53.363]  So you can hide out and then have your little speech or whatever and then sneak back into the green room.
[00:36:53.403 --> 00:36:58.785]  Because, I don't know, until you've experienced it, it's really something to behold.
[00:36:59.477 --> 00:37:15.301]  But it's exciting that all over the country people are getting informed, they're getting involved, they're fighting the New World Order, and all of you are leaders, all of you are just as important as I am or anybody else is, and I commend you for taking action, and I'm excited about these events that are coming up.
[00:37:15.321 --> 00:37:16.241]  All right, let's go back to the calls.
[00:37:16.621 --> 00:37:17.841]  Quickly now, I've got to move fast.
[00:37:17.881 --> 00:37:18.962]  David, finish up in Boston.
[00:37:19.702 --> 00:37:25.243]  Oh yeah, I was just saying that I wouldn't debate anybody with a subjective viewpoint, an empirical framework.
[00:37:25.263 --> 00:37:27.144]  But listen, I want to tell you a story.
[00:37:27.944 --> 00:37:28.744]  That past weekend,
[00:37:30.404 --> 00:37:33.886]  My cousin's boyfriend is sort of a working-class guy.
[00:37:33.926 --> 00:37:38.168]  He's not really, you know, too scholastically bright, but he's a good guy.
[00:37:38.288 --> 00:37:42.870]  And he was raving about Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9-11.
[00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:47.472]  And I gave him DVD copies of not only Martial Law, but Road to Tyranny.
[00:37:49.133 --> 00:37:49.353]  Hello?
[00:37:49.873 --> 00:37:50.153]  Yes, sir.
[00:37:50.173 --> 00:37:50.433]  I'm here.
[00:37:50.853 --> 00:37:51.654]  Oh, yeah.
[00:37:51.734 --> 00:37:52.434]  Sorry, I didn't hear anything.
[00:37:52.494 --> 00:37:56.436]  But anyway, I gave him that and I told him, look, you know,
[00:37:57.427 --> 00:38:04.571]  Fahrenheit 9-11's pretty, you know, got a few little interesting points, but this is like literally playing a game of jacks versus a game of chess.
[00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.491]  With your films, and that's what I do.
[00:38:07.571 --> 00:38:10.813]  I give out your films really to working class everyday people.
[00:38:10.893 --> 00:38:16.457]  I try to stay away from the elite people at the university level because they're just going to support the criminal system.
[00:38:17.397 --> 00:38:18.538]  Let me ask you a question.
[00:38:18.578 --> 00:38:20.279]  Have you gotten feedback from people yet?
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:21.800]  Yeah, I've gotten a few.
[00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:22.461]  Yeah, a few.
[00:38:23.541 --> 00:38:25.603]  A few films, a few copies I've given out.
[00:38:25.623 --> 00:38:30.666]  I've gotten some feedback from pretty, I mean, people essentially being really surprised.
[00:38:31.526 --> 00:38:33.488]  And I mean, not only
[00:38:34.839 --> 00:38:42.467]  Uh, completely, uh, becoming really more awake about these issues and at least trying and exploring them on their own, but just really stunned.
[00:38:42.627 --> 00:38:45.209]  I mean, a lot of people just say they're stunned about the information.
[00:38:46.410 --> 00:38:49.073]  And, um, that's, uh, that's a powerful thing.
[00:38:49.554 --> 00:38:52.156]  That's just getting people to explore the information on their own.
[00:38:52.416 --> 00:38:54.819]  Well, David, I appreciate what you're doing and take care of my friend.
[00:38:54.839 --> 00:38:55.579]  Please keep it up.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.060]  Jeff?
[00:38:56.923 --> 00:38:57.723]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[00:38:57.743 --> 00:38:58.584]  Where are you calling from?
[00:38:58.804 --> 00:39:00.464]  Oh, I'm calling from Chelsea, Massachusetts.
[00:39:00.584 --> 00:39:04.066]  Another caller up in those there parts.
[00:39:04.106 --> 00:39:04.446]  Welcome.
[00:39:04.786 --> 00:39:05.926]  Oh, thank you very much.
[00:39:06.466 --> 00:39:20.752]  Now, as far as this caller named Chris yesterday, and I hope Chris is listening, because September the 11th, when you're doing an investigation, one has to look at who stands to gain from all this.
[00:39:21.012 --> 00:39:21.572]  And guess what?
[00:39:22.219 --> 00:39:23.940]  Bush gained from September 11th.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:24.860]  Well, I think that's it.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:36.545]  You know, I think we're going to have to air at least part of his call, maybe ten minutes of it, because I've got, I probably got, I opened my email last night and I probably got a hundred emails about that guy.
[00:39:37.145 --> 00:39:38.585]  Literally, folks.
[00:39:39.086 --> 00:39:40.606]  Boy, he really hit a nerve, didn't he?
[00:39:41.126 --> 00:39:43.227]  Oh yes, because did you know what it is?
[00:39:43.647 --> 00:39:50.110]  I think Chris watches too much Fox News and too much of the filtered liberal media and the fact of the matter is
[00:39:50.578 --> 00:39:55.443]  But what Bush had to gain was total control with Patriot Act 1, Patriot Act 2.
[00:39:57.044 --> 00:39:59.726]  I have a book called I Spy Magazine on page 57.
[00:39:59.947 --> 00:40:07.013]  It talks about the NSA being able to eavesdrop on every email, phone call, and fax, and telex.
[00:40:07.073 --> 00:40:07.834]  Did you hear that?
[00:40:08.074 --> 00:40:14.200]  The NSA specifically picked up, not hundreds, folks this is the Associated Press,
[00:40:15.012 --> 00:40:15.493]  That's great!
[00:40:34.802 --> 00:40:40.408]  Oh no, but he said there's... and I would give him those facts, and he would just say, no, it's not true.
[00:40:40.488 --> 00:40:41.369]  Well, you know what it is?
[00:40:41.409 --> 00:40:49.657]  It's because people have a certain mindset, which is if it's on a shortwave radio, then it's extreme right-wing Nazi.
[00:40:50.017 --> 00:40:51.919]  Which, you know, there is no such thing as right-wing.
[00:40:52.307 --> 00:40:53.568]  And there's no such thing as left-wing.
[00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.849]  It's either big government or small government.
[00:40:56.069 --> 00:41:00.012]  Well, I mean, look, I mean, the government now is calling environmental activists Nazis.
[00:41:00.032 --> 00:41:02.894]  They're calling people that fight racist groups Nazis.
[00:41:02.914 --> 00:41:04.635]  I mean, that label doesn't work anymore.
[00:41:05.235 --> 00:41:14.581]  It doesn't, but you see, but in people's minds, people still have that old canard image, and it's propagated by the left-wing media, and it seems like
[00:41:15.034 --> 00:41:17.816]  He with the loudest megaphone, that's the rule.
[00:41:18.477 --> 00:41:21.259]  And they can change labels, change names at any time.
[00:41:21.459 --> 00:41:21.799]  I hear you.
[00:41:22.179 --> 00:41:26.903]  And in legal law, that is called an ad hoc homonym attack.
[00:41:27.063 --> 00:41:28.304]  Attacking the body.
[00:41:29.105 --> 00:41:33.048]  Well, and he just said that I basically believe in space aliens, which I don't even talk about on this show.
[00:41:33.068 --> 00:41:33.608]  Thanks for the call.
[00:41:34.048 --> 00:41:34.909]  Good to hear from you, Jeff.
[00:41:35.149 --> 00:41:36.911]  And I'll say this.
[00:41:37.851 --> 00:41:38.992]  The worm has turned.
[00:41:40.073 --> 00:41:40.473]  Okay?
[00:41:40.633 --> 00:41:42.435]  I mean, we're not just on shortwave, folks.
[00:41:44.309 --> 00:41:47.332]  Almost nine years I've been on commercial AM and FM stations.
[00:41:48.573 --> 00:41:50.674]  But the worm has turned.
[00:41:50.714 --> 00:41:54.477]  I mean, we're on in San Diego, in Los Angeles.
[00:41:54.537 --> 00:41:55.778]  We're on in Chicago.
[00:41:56.159 --> 00:41:58.941]  We've been on for almost six years in Kansas City.
[00:41:59.482 --> 00:41:59.802]  What is it?
[00:41:59.842 --> 00:42:00.402]  Five years.
[00:42:01.043 --> 00:42:04.346]  We've been on in Pensacola, Florida for about six years.
[00:42:04.886 --> 00:42:07.988]  About five years in Knoxville, Tennessee and surrounding areas.
[00:42:09.261 --> 00:42:14.624]  Rochester, New York, just station after station after station.
[00:42:15.084 --> 00:42:18.767]  I've been to almost every talk show in the country as a guest.
[00:42:20.848 --> 00:42:23.930]  I mean, I might get one email that disagrees with me out of a hundred.
[00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:27.011]  Literally, it's less than that.
[00:42:28.252 --> 00:42:32.454]  And those emails are, you're a right-wing Nazi, I'm going to kill you.
[00:42:32.635 --> 00:42:35.036]  Or, you're a left-wing communist, I'm going to get you.
[00:42:36.457 --> 00:42:40.444]  It's just some mindless idiot who saw some news article they didn't like on my website.
[00:42:41.345 --> 00:42:46.513]  A lot of what we post is mainstream propaganda, and we put our little comments above it just to point out what they're up to.
[00:42:46.533 --> 00:42:48.697]  It doesn't mean we agree with everything that's on our website.
[00:42:49.611 --> 00:43:00.217]  You know, I link to communist websites, to neocon websites, I link to Nazi websites, I link to extreme left-wing websites, I link to government documents.
[00:43:00.598 --> 00:43:03.239]  I mean, it's just buffoonery.
[00:43:03.479 --> 00:43:05.901]  These people are psychological maroons.
[00:43:06.481 --> 00:43:12.365]  They are stranded out on a desert island with just basically no information.
[00:43:14.186 --> 00:43:17.548]  But look, they're becoming the vast minority, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:18.931 --> 00:43:20.452]  But I see it time and time again.
[00:43:20.532 --> 00:43:22.973]  Look, I talk about this every week.
[00:43:22.993 --> 00:43:23.934]  I've got to throw this in there.
[00:43:24.054 --> 00:43:26.895]  I mean, the majority of people I talk to agree with us.
[00:43:28.116 --> 00:43:33.899]  But they all feel like they're alone because they watch the nightly news and they think, oh, that's the majority view.
[00:43:35.519 --> 00:43:36.840]  Folks, they're losing their viewers.
[00:43:36.860 --> 00:43:37.781]  They're falling apart.
[00:43:38.181 --> 00:43:41.662]  The newspaper circulation is down by 60 plus percent in the last 10 years.
[00:43:42.563 --> 00:43:46.605]  11 plus percent, almost 12 percent, the average newspaper in the last year.
[00:43:47.065 --> 00:43:48.486]  It's accelerating!
[00:43:49.201 --> 00:43:50.861]  They're losing control!
[00:43:52.502 --> 00:43:54.042]  Again, I've used the analogy many times.
[00:43:55.342 --> 00:44:08.145]  For ten years, a lot of the top scientists and mathematicians of the day were saying, no, the Earth orbits the Sun, we are not the center of the universe, and we are not flat, we are round.
[00:44:10.286 --> 00:44:12.626]  We are round like a sphere.
[00:44:13.586 --> 00:44:16.507]  We are a spherical, heavenly body.
[00:44:18.194 --> 00:44:19.716]  We are the third planet.
[00:44:20.797 --> 00:44:24.080]  And they said, grab them, burn them at the stake, lock them up.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:34.731]  And then, overnight, in the scheme of time, within a decade, you were a kook if you thought it was flat.
[00:44:35.471 --> 00:44:40.016]  So, yeah, I mean, I said the world was round, to use the analogy, before a lot of people.
[00:44:40.996 --> 00:44:44.080]  There were folks before I did, you know, that were saying, I used to think it was flat.
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.304]  They were saying it was round, and I laughed at them at first, until I checked it out.
[00:44:47.945 --> 00:44:51.549]  So, shoot your mouths off, say we're crazy, do whatever you want to do!
[00:44:53.572 --> 00:44:54.493]  It's like Chelchesky.
[00:44:55.618 --> 00:44:56.779]  Over in the former Eastern Bloc.
[00:44:56.799 --> 00:45:01.542]  I mean, he had total control, cameras on the street corners, secret arrest, torture, execution.
[00:45:02.163 --> 00:45:05.245]  And just finally, one day, everybody starts saying, you know, I'm sick of him!
[00:45:05.385 --> 00:45:06.866]  Finally, a few people started protesting.
[00:45:07.206 --> 00:45:09.047]  And the cops went, you know, I'm sick of him, too!
[00:45:09.087 --> 00:45:09.888]  He killed my uncle!
[00:45:10.108 --> 00:45:10.828]  Yeah, we're with you!
[00:45:10.888 --> 00:45:11.209]  Come on!
[00:45:11.329 --> 00:45:11.989]  Come on, everybody!
[00:45:12.009 --> 00:45:12.910]  Aaaaaah!
[00:45:13.030 --> 00:45:14.171]  It was just, boom!
[00:45:14.231 --> 00:45:14.731]  It happened!
[00:45:16.092 --> 00:45:20.435]  Well, I don't want that to take place, because the globalists have got plans for that as well, and then to put in a fake
[00:45:21.281 --> 00:45:28.344]  Kind of leftist government to counter the evil neocons that there's some type of revolution.
[00:45:30.225 --> 00:45:34.006]  Or it could be a fake right-wing government that dealt with the New World Order.
[00:45:34.026 --> 00:45:37.988]  There's a lot of dangers, folks, but you cannot suppress the truth.
[00:45:38.048 --> 00:45:40.769]  It will, I forget the exact quote, it will explode.
[00:45:40.789 --> 00:45:45.571]  If you try to bury it, it will then explode with even greater force and destroy the lies.
[00:45:47.117 --> 00:45:49.499]  So the globalists are trying to co-opt the message.
[00:45:49.519 --> 00:45:51.320]  They're trying to put up their disinformation agents.
[00:45:52.541 --> 00:45:59.826]  I mean, just legions of them attacking and lying and twisting and absconding.
[00:46:01.567 --> 00:46:07.711]  But again, I take it as a badge of honor when I am savaged by some of the biggest radio talk show hosts in the country.
[00:46:08.092 --> 00:46:11.034]  When I am savaged by major newspapers and magazines.
[00:46:11.594 --> 00:46:12.875]  When I am savaged
[00:46:13.713 --> 00:46:24.639]  By the way, why hasn't William F. Jasper retracted his false statement?
[00:46:24.679 --> 00:46:27.140]  Because we have made calls, listeners have made calls.
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.461]  Davon Kleist doesn't work for me.
[00:46:29.861 --> 00:46:31.102]  He's never worked for me.
[00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:33.711]  I didn't go to Klamath Falls.
[00:46:34.251 --> 00:46:37.173]  Dave went there and reported at Klamath Falls.
[00:46:37.193 --> 00:46:38.694]  He was invited by the people there.
[00:46:38.814 --> 00:46:39.715]  I interviewed Dave.
[00:46:40.015 --> 00:46:40.795]  I interviewed those people.
[00:46:40.835 --> 00:46:42.737]  And they've got it that Dave works for me.
[00:46:43.597 --> 00:46:45.999]  And he's basically a provocateur working for me.
[00:46:46.199 --> 00:46:47.519]  That's saying I'm a provocateur.
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.142]  Out there at Klamath Falls when they were shutting off the water.
[00:46:52.463 --> 00:46:54.224]  You know, just amazing statements.
[00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:55.925]  Look, I don't care, folks.
[00:46:56.485 --> 00:46:59.667]  And I've never thrown a punch at the New American.
[00:47:01.357 --> 00:47:02.557]  I've never done a thing to them.
[00:47:02.637 --> 00:47:03.778]  I've been supportive of them.
[00:47:03.798 --> 00:47:06.598]  I haven't really said a lot about it.
[00:47:07.239 --> 00:47:09.639]  For people that don't like me defending myself, hey, grow up!
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:13.100]  They need to retract that.
[00:47:14.681 --> 00:47:16.141]  Jasper claimed he was going to call me.
[00:47:16.181 --> 00:47:18.542]  He's welcome on this show, but I haven't received that phone call.
[00:47:19.482 --> 00:47:22.343]  I haven't received that email that I know of, though I do miss some emails.
[00:47:22.363 --> 00:47:23.203]  I don't miss phone calls.
[00:47:23.863 --> 00:47:26.344]  Sometimes my spam detector screens out good emails.
[00:47:27.796 --> 00:47:30.338]  But if we don't have the spam detector, the email won't even open.
[00:47:30.358 --> 00:47:34.641]  We've got thousands of those Viagra ads, so we can all go blind.
[00:47:36.422 --> 00:47:38.043]  Mortgage ads, it's unbelievable.
[00:47:38.443 --> 00:47:39.904]  Let's talk to Ed in Pennsylvania.
[00:47:40.004 --> 00:47:40.605]  Ed, go ahead.
[00:47:41.085 --> 00:47:46.829]  Hi Alex, this is an opportune time to bring this subject up as you follow up what you just said.
[00:47:47.830 --> 00:47:55.955]  I finally got a response from the New American, from their Secretary, Ann Shibler, on their May issue that's talking about you and
[00:47:56.556 --> 00:47:58.017]  All the patriots, in general.
[00:47:58.737 --> 00:48:03.260]  Anyway, I sent them a letter telling them to quit shooting the messengers.
[00:48:04.401 --> 00:48:14.047]  And, uh, if you want proof of concentration camps, black helicopters using live ammo, why don't you get a couple of Alex's documentary videos?
[00:48:14.908 --> 00:48:15.949]  I can't deny that.
[00:48:15.969 --> 00:48:17.149]  Let me stop you.
[00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:18.270]  I know they deny it.
[00:48:18.670 --> 00:48:20.672]  They have LexisNexis.
[00:48:21.494 --> 00:48:22.915]  That gives them every news article.
[00:48:23.016 --> 00:48:24.737]  I mean, I have the Dallas Morning News.
[00:48:24.877 --> 00:48:25.638]  This is Texas.
[00:48:26.619 --> 00:48:28.180]  The Corpus Christi Caller Times.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:29.982]  The San Antonio Express News.
[00:48:30.522 --> 00:48:31.984]  The Austin American Statesman.
[00:48:32.504 --> 00:48:33.525]  With bribery.
[00:48:33.545 --> 00:48:35.207]  Blowing up buildings.
[00:48:35.387 --> 00:48:36.688]  Terrorizing public.
[00:48:37.069 --> 00:48:37.969]  Foreign troops.
[00:48:39.070 --> 00:48:40.952]  And, I know, it doesn't exist.
[00:48:41.012 --> 00:48:41.513]  I'm crazy.
[00:48:41.853 --> 00:48:44.575]  Okay, so now they're sending me a form letter.
[00:48:44.776 --> 00:48:47.158]  Not even responding to all my questions, alright?
[00:48:47.845 --> 00:48:55.432]  And they said that entering into arguments and contentions with others is counterproductive and muddies the waters, keeping everyone from the real truth.
[00:48:55.492 --> 00:48:57.994]  I told them if you want the real truth, look at it.
[00:48:58.194 --> 00:48:59.015]  It's in front of you.
[00:48:59.315 --> 00:48:59.775]  Call in.
[00:48:59.815 --> 00:49:01.077]  He doesn't want to debate you.
[00:49:01.537 --> 00:49:04.079]  He wants to set you straight with real information.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.261]  And I get no response.
[00:49:06.641 --> 00:49:10.144]  Anyway, if you want a copy of this letter, just
[00:49:11.337 --> 00:49:14.960]  Having your archives, I'll mail it to you, because I'm done with the New American.
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:18.343]  They're nothing, I told them, you're acting like neocons, alright?
[00:49:18.723 --> 00:49:35.958]  You're putting guilt by association with that Kleist, what's his name, uh, Von Kleist, and, and, uh, I said, this is all standard operation of neocons, and you people have become them, and I'm not renewing the subscription.
[00:49:36.488 --> 00:49:41.174]  Well, listen, I appreciate the call and your defense of myself and others, Ed.
[00:49:41.194 --> 00:49:41.695]  God bless you.
[00:49:41.715 --> 00:49:42.476]  But I'll just say this.
[00:49:44.619 --> 00:49:47.162]  I think the jury is still out on the new American.
[00:49:48.744 --> 00:49:52.509]  I mean, they're fighting the FTAA, they fight for the Second Amendment, they do a lot of good things.
[00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:55.411]  I would think that they were bad news.
[00:49:55.911 --> 00:50:14.200]  I would be convinced of it if I hadn't met William F. Jasper at Urban Warrior, standing on a hilltop, over Oakland, California, watching German, Dutch, French, Israeli, Australian, uh, did I mention British, troops swarming around with American role players screaming, I'm an American, please don't knock the camp.
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:17.161]  That's in Police State 2000.
[00:50:17.541 --> 00:50:17.961]  Excuse me.
[00:50:18.061 --> 00:50:21.083]  And so I'm up on this hilltop, and I have to have a backpack with me,
[00:50:22.313 --> 00:50:23.314]  Mike Hanson actually had it.
[00:50:23.354 --> 00:50:24.675]  I waved Mike over and I said, Mr. Jasper!
[00:50:24.695 --> 00:50:30.919]  I said, I'm going to do my radio show via telephone, doing call-ins with the fill-in host I had filling in for the week I was in Oakland.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:32.140]  This was back in 99.
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:38.565]  And I said, here's an AP article about the police chief saying they tried to bribe him, dealt the force, terrorizing the public.
[00:50:39.206 --> 00:50:39.926]  He goes, wow!
[00:50:41.327 --> 00:50:44.970]  A month and a half later, folks, guess what was in their magazine?
[00:50:45.270 --> 00:50:45.911]  That article.
[00:50:46.571 --> 00:50:47.812]  I reprinted that AP article.
[00:50:48.738 --> 00:50:51.500]  So, I mean, maybe they just don't get out much.
[00:50:54.362 --> 00:50:55.102]  But you know what?
[00:50:55.122 --> 00:50:58.725]  Dave Vaughn Clydes doesn't work for me and I don't appreciate them saying that.
[00:51:01.644 --> 00:51:08.509]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:10.191]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.371 --> 00:51:12.593]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.733 --> 00:51:14.814]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:15.095 --> 00:51:20.018]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.359 --> 00:51:24.402]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.642 --> 00:51:26.403]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.483 --> 00:51:37.130]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:39.192]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:54:08.775 --> 00:54:11.635]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.456 --> 00:54:26.139]  You know, you're welcome to comment about whatever you want, but if I spent time on all of my detractors, I wouldn't even have a radio show.
[00:54:26.259 --> 00:54:27.399]  I mean, it would be about that.
[00:54:28.859 --> 00:54:32.040]  That's why we don't attack other patriots, even if I disagree with them.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.081]  We don't spend our time on those issues.
[00:54:36.016 --> 00:54:37.196]  Because it's a tar boot.
[00:54:37.356 --> 00:54:39.137]  We've got to focus on the New World Order.
[00:54:39.637 --> 00:54:41.117]  The free trade area of the Americas.
[00:54:41.157 --> 00:54:42.258]  The toll roads going in.
[00:54:42.298 --> 00:54:44.058]  The cancer viruses and the vaccines.
[00:54:44.538 --> 00:54:45.158]  Abortion.
[00:54:45.959 --> 00:54:47.439]  The looming war with Iran.
[00:54:48.239 --> 00:54:49.900]  Government sponsored terrorism.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:51.940]  Genetically engineered foods.
[00:54:52.621 --> 00:54:57.422]  And their horrible health, not risk, but the facts of what they do to mammals.
[00:54:57.522 --> 00:54:58.242]  Very bad for you.
[00:54:59.342 --> 00:55:01.623]  I try to stay focused on this and real issues.
[00:55:02.586 --> 00:55:13.654]  But you do gotta respond when the Homeland Security's cousin, you know, writes a sniveling, ultra-massive hit piece on a bunch of good people, and then invents false arguments that aren't even true against us.
[00:55:15.075 --> 00:55:28.164]  And that's why I'm mad at the New American, is because Dave von Kleist, and I think Dave's a good guy, but he, you know, first they call him a provocateur, and then say he works for me like I'm the big grand provocateur.
[00:55:28.225 --> 00:55:29.305]  It's just made up.
[00:55:30.066 --> 00:55:31.527]  It's an invention against me.
[00:55:32.429 --> 00:55:34.770]  And that's what the detractors do out there.
[00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:38.873]  Some of them idiots, some of them agents, some of them just stalkers and egomaniacs.
[00:55:38.993 --> 00:55:40.794]  It runs the gamut.
[00:55:42.195 --> 00:55:47.278]  They invent things or they take rumors somebody else said and then hook them up as fact.
[00:55:47.398 --> 00:55:51.340]  And oh man, I have sued people several times and I've won.
[00:55:53.461 --> 00:55:55.702]  Dealing with libel and slander and things of that nature.
[00:55:55.722 --> 00:55:56.843]  Because I know the law.
[00:55:56.963 --> 00:55:58.284]  That's why I'm very careful.
[00:55:59.684 --> 00:56:11.527]  I mean, I will slam these people, but if I spent my time suing people, I mean, if any of it ever gets egregious enough, I told the ADL I'd sue them in a letter, and they did pull some stuff and left some other stuff up.
[00:56:12.647 --> 00:56:16.448]  Again, I mean, it's really simple.
[00:56:17.348 --> 00:56:19.228]  They've been losing a lot of lawsuits.
[00:56:19.248 --> 00:56:20.028]  They need to be careful.
[00:56:21.249 --> 00:56:21.649]  I don't know.
[00:56:23.251 --> 00:56:24.111]  People better watch it.
[00:56:24.151 --> 00:56:26.772]  Someday I might just let fly with a whole parcel of lawsuits.
[00:56:26.852 --> 00:56:28.452]  I mean, it's not that hard to do.
[00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:37.914]  If people really slander you and they show a long course of doing it, and they say they're trying to hurt you financially, they're dead meat, folks.
[00:56:38.234 --> 00:56:40.214]  The courts will incinerate them.
[00:56:40.994 --> 00:56:42.775]  The juries will burn them.
[00:56:43.495 --> 00:56:49.476]  You just read them a law, and you show them what it is, and these fools follow it exactly.
[00:56:51.451 --> 00:56:57.313]  One time somebody was saying horrible stuff about my sister of all people, and saying people should go after her, and that was it.
[00:56:58.114 --> 00:57:01.235]  And you want to get sued, say something about my family.
[00:57:01.955 --> 00:57:06.357]  And I will sue you in my jurisdiction, and I will, and you might even beat the rap.
[00:57:06.477 --> 00:57:09.318]  Those that I have sued haven't beat the rap.
[00:57:10.358 --> 00:57:11.999]  But you're not going to beat the ride.
[00:57:12.079 --> 00:57:13.499]  I'm going to take you for a ride.
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:14.780]  You understand that?
[00:57:15.643 --> 00:57:18.085]  I will take you for a ride because money means nothing to me.
[00:57:18.165 --> 00:57:23.170]  I'll plop the cash down with my vicious lawyers and I will tear you up big time.
[00:57:23.971 --> 00:57:26.172]  So, people might be surprised in the near future.
[00:57:26.512 --> 00:57:29.272]  They might get a very, a very nice surprise.
[00:57:30.373 --> 00:57:36.394]  Multiple individuals and organizations might get a very nice surprise in the near future.
[00:57:36.414 --> 00:57:37.614]  I mean, you heard George Galloway.
[00:57:37.995 --> 00:57:40.415]  Just won six million dollars.
[00:57:40.695 --> 00:57:41.635]  Was it three million dollars?
[00:57:41.735 --> 00:57:43.196]  I caught him on a few days ago.
[00:57:43.516 --> 00:57:44.816]  They slandered him.
[00:57:45.256 --> 00:57:45.997]  They libeled him.
[00:57:46.037 --> 00:57:46.497]  He sued them!
[00:57:47.877 --> 00:57:49.557]  And so, be advised.
[00:57:49.738 --> 00:57:51.618]  Every single solitary one of you.
[00:57:52.470 --> 00:58:19.362]  uh... that uh... i'll take you for a ride and chances are you will not beat the crap but again you will not guaranteed beat the ride alright we're gonna so yeah i'm done with that subject folks i don't want to attack the new american i don't want to sit here and attack popular mechanics anymore i don't want to attack the new york times anymore the ADL it's a distraction i got masses of news here key information here and i've spent so much time on this now no time to plug my videos

[00:58:59.387 --> 00:59:00.428]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.169 --> 00:59:02.270]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.930 --> 00:59:03.771]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.492 --> 00:59:05.412]  Well, so does he.

[00:59:10.256 --> 00:59:14.419]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.242 --> 00:59:20.965]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, now into our number two.
[00:59:22.173 --> 00:59:25.175]  We're here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:25.195 --> 00:59:25.835]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:25.855 --> 00:59:28.276]  Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:30.057 --> 00:59:33.879]  Nelson, Mike, James, Don, and others, always nice to have the ladies call in.
[00:59:34.039 --> 00:59:38.921]  Some days it's all women, most days it's mostly men.
[00:59:38.941 --> 00:59:39.161]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:39.782 --> 00:59:40.942]  Coming up, U.S.
[00:59:41.002 --> 00:59:44.464]  offers return on water, electricity, and residents inform on residents of U.S.
[00:59:44.504 --> 00:59:45.084]  occupation.
[00:59:45.444 --> 00:59:47.786]  I want to talk more about that sheriff out in L.A.
[00:59:47.806 --> 00:59:48.046]  and the ADL.
[00:59:49.682 --> 01:00:00.804]  Wanting to arrest anyone that basically criticizes the government and register you as a anti-government person, like a sexual offender, sexual predator database.
[01:00:00.824 --> 01:00:03.045]  I mean, they're getting desperate, folks, because they're losing control.
[01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:07.346]  Also, the expansion of the Patriot Act moving along quite nicely.
[01:00:08.546 --> 01:00:10.966]  Sensenbrenner's snitch-or-go-to-jail bill.
[01:00:11.026 --> 01:00:12.027]  Want to go over that analysis?
[01:00:12.507 --> 01:00:14.947]  Israeli troops admit eye-for-an-eye killings report.
[01:00:15.347 --> 01:00:16.828]  But right now, you've been holding long enough.
[01:00:16.848 --> 01:00:18.068]  Let's go to your calls.
[01:00:18.912 --> 01:00:21.996]  Let's talk to Nelson in New York.
[01:00:22.056 --> 01:00:22.737]  Welcome, Nelson.
[01:00:23.057 --> 01:00:23.618]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:23.638 --> 01:00:24.299]  How you doing?
[01:00:24.439 --> 01:00:25.000]  Good, my friend.
[01:00:25.501 --> 01:00:28.104]  Listen, first of all, I'd like to thank you for opening up my eyes.
[01:00:28.304 --> 01:00:31.909]  Unfortunately, when the elections came, I voted for Bush.
[01:00:32.109 --> 01:00:33.010]  I didn't know any better.
[01:00:33.030 --> 01:00:35.994]  I heard you on George Noory, and I've been a fan ever since.
[01:00:36.826 --> 01:00:46.993]  But, uh, what I actually called for was, uh, usually you got a lot of articles on your website that I catch sometimes, but you get them, your guys are good, they get them on the internet before I could send you anything.
[01:00:47.453 --> 01:00:49.435]  But I got something maybe that's interesting to you.
[01:00:50.095 --> 01:00:57.340]  It's, uh, in the National Geographic's, uh, May 2005 issue, the one that just came out, I sent you a, uh, email.
[01:00:57.952 --> 01:00:59.614]  With the whole article and advertising?
[01:00:59.634 --> 01:01:05.121]  Yeah, my whole crew's been busy with these upcoming movies, so we are a little bit behind the last few days.
[01:01:05.861 --> 01:01:07.323]  Why don't you send it to Paul Watson?
[01:01:08.144 --> 01:01:08.885]  Paul Watson?
[01:01:08.905 --> 01:01:11.588]  Yeah, that's the webmaster for the Prison Planet side.
[01:01:11.788 --> 01:01:12.429]  Oh, okay.
[01:01:12.850 --> 01:01:17.095]  Go to Prison Planet, it says contact webmaster, and Paul's really good about not missing stuff.
[01:01:17.634 --> 01:01:19.355]  Well, this article should be interesting.
[01:01:19.475 --> 01:01:33.401]  It's about National Geographic teaming up with IBM to do, like, this, uh, it's called a, uh, uh, genetic, uh, project, where they weren't... Yeah, going around, you know, we talked about this three months ago.
[01:01:33.761 --> 01:01:34.401]  Oh, did you?
[01:01:34.702 --> 01:01:57.872]  Yeah, they're teaming up to get everyone's DNA, because they love all the little tribes of people, and by the way, IBM's in the human genome, connected to race-specific bio-weapons that Dick Cheney's called for the development of, and I guarantee you my bottom dollar, and again, National Geographic may not even know this, but I know IBM does, that's cool uses, and this is very dangerous.
[01:01:58.732 --> 01:02:02.474]  They were in the last DVD you put out, you mentioned about how they help
[01:02:02.854 --> 01:02:06.938]  Keep catalog track or something like that of the tools that they have in the camps.
[01:02:07.558 --> 01:02:19.288]  That's why when I go to IBM... Mr. Watson, not my webmaster, but the owner of IBM was a big Nazi, big supporter, big bohemian grub, fool society, a bohemian grub guy.
[01:02:20.382 --> 01:02:29.449]  And, uh, so he's part of the Order of Death, and you're absolutely... No, I mean, I... In the PNAC documents, Dick Cheney says race-specific bioweapons need to be developed.
[01:02:29.509 --> 01:02:34.412]  Well, I mean, these poor tribes are going to give these people their blood, and they're going to have every genome on the planet.
[01:02:34.712 --> 01:02:35.293]  Yep, yep.
[01:02:35.613 --> 01:02:40.617]  Oh, and another thing I wanted to mention about this guy, Chris, that you had on the other day that you spoke to?
[01:02:40.717 --> 01:02:41.797]  Yes, Lord Moron.
[01:02:41.898 --> 01:02:43.539]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:44.219 --> 01:03:13.594]  uh... he said something about why didn't you take these people to court or something like that and you had said that uh... that they didn't let it go to court like they didn't want to listen or whatever but something he may not be thinking about is is he saying that what you were saying was wrong or you're mistaken or it was a lie or whatever it was he believes in his little world but he's gotta look at it from a different angle if what you're saying is a lie and it was slander wouldn't the people who you were saying these things against Bush and all his minions
[01:03:14.054 --> 01:03:14.834]  Come after you!
[01:03:15.115 --> 01:03:20.157]  The reason they haven't come and get into court is because then you have to defend yourself.
[01:03:20.217 --> 01:03:23.118]  And by defending yourself, they're doing a thing for life.
[01:03:23.398 --> 01:03:27.600]  We are very, very careful to have at least three sources on anything we cover.
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:28.060]  Right.
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:38.565]  I mean, look, Jimmy Walter ran several million dollars of ads in New York alone asking Larry Silverstein, you say you blew up Building 7, please answer.
[01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:40.306]  Silverstein didn't respond.
[01:03:41.556 --> 01:03:44.078]  We're talking over two million in New York alone.
[01:03:44.399 --> 01:03:46.821]  He didn't respond, because he says he blew it up!
[01:03:48.102 --> 01:03:49.963]  Please answer us, Larry Silverstein.
[01:03:50.104 --> 01:03:50.664]  Good points.
[01:03:53.487 --> 01:03:57.830]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.991 --> 01:04:02.434]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.575 --> 01:04:06.958]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.978 --> 01:04:08.340]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:09.841]  Hammered!
[01:04:10.101 --> 01:04:14.346]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.406 --> 01:04:21.334]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.454 --> 01:04:23.477]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.817 --> 01:04:34.282]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.442 --> 01:04:39.825]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:52.971 --> 01:04:56.252]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.292 --> 01:05:00.474]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.734 --> 01:05:03.515]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.715 --> 01:05:06.116]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.296 --> 01:05:14.940]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:16.480]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:20.862]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.182 --> 01:05:21.943]  We're good to go.
[01:05:52.543 --> 01:06:00.509]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:06:00.910 --> 01:06:02.190]  It suppresses your immune system!
[01:06:02.391 --> 01:06:03.031]  Now check this out.
[01:06:03.411 --> 01:06:06.854]  The average American consumes 2-3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:06:07.154 --> 01:06:09.276]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year!
[01:06:09.796 --> 01:06:12.479]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:13.500]  Your health suffers.
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:14.341]  It's that simple.
[01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.523]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight.
[01:06:16.704 --> 01:06:18.686]  With the dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio.
[01:06:19.126 --> 01:06:27.055]  The dietary supplement, Agaricus Bio, was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[01:06:53.354 --> 01:06:58.397]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.758 --> 01:07:01.099]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:17.670]  Alright, I want to plunge into the news and all the propaganda that the globalists are engaging in, but to finish up a comment on what Nelson was saying, we had this caller in the third hour named Mike yesterday,
[01:07:18.542 --> 01:07:25.728]  And I've gotten record numbers of emails and almost every caller that's been calling in heard this buffoon yesterday.
[01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:33.275]  I'm sure he's a well-meaning guy, I shouldn't call him a buffoon, but he really is in la-la land when it comes to the facts.
[01:07:34.396 --> 01:07:35.957]  And I learned some background on him.
[01:07:36.378 --> 01:07:38.579]  He called the TV show Comment Line.
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:44.384]  And Mike Hanson called him back and he argued with him for about 30 minutes, according to Mike's message.
[01:07:44.424 --> 01:07:45.986]  I haven't talked to Mike, he left a long message.
[01:07:47.854 --> 01:07:49.916]  And Mike said, well, tune into the radio.
[01:07:49.936 --> 01:07:50.736]  Do you listen to the radio?
[01:07:50.756 --> 01:07:51.997]  And the guy says, yeah, I'm listening.
[01:07:52.037 --> 01:07:53.218]  Well, call in and tell him.
[01:07:53.238 --> 01:07:54.479]  I'm done talking to you.
[01:07:55.480 --> 01:07:58.362]  Because Mike said he'd give him facts and the guy would just move on to the next thing.
[01:07:58.402 --> 01:08:02.866]  So we have to actually, I guess, import people that disagree with us to the radio show now.
[01:08:03.206 --> 01:08:04.707]  So that's where Mike came from.
[01:08:04.927 --> 01:08:06.869]  He called Mike Hanson and they had a big argument.
[01:08:07.890 --> 01:08:09.291]  And the guy didn't have any facts.
[01:08:09.311 --> 01:08:15.656]  So I'm going to re-air part of that argument we had coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:08:17.188 --> 01:08:22.112]  But, but, at one point he made was, well why haven't you sued the government for 9-11?
[01:08:22.172 --> 01:08:24.373]  Why haven't you gotten a grand jury to do something?
[01:08:26.455 --> 01:08:30.578]  Well, folks, what do you think Mr. Berg has done?
[01:08:30.618 --> 01:08:33.320]  The former Deputy Attorney General, you know, the major state.
[01:08:33.360 --> 01:08:37.002]  What do you think all the victims, hundreds of the victims' families have done?
[01:08:37.022 --> 01:08:39.944]  What do you think Bob Bills, former Chief of Staff has done?
[01:08:39.984 --> 01:08:40.725]  Stanley Hilton?
[01:08:41.846 --> 01:08:43.387]  What do you think all these people have done?
[01:08:44.236 --> 01:08:48.499]  FBI agents have sued the government and told international security the courts ordered to drop it.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.843]  I mean, there have been, it's got to be, 20 different lawsuits, more than that.
[01:08:54.684 --> 01:08:55.644]  I haven't counted them up.
[01:08:55.704 --> 01:08:57.105]  I mean, it is a mass of them.
[01:08:58.846 --> 01:09:04.030]  A lot of them class action suits, and families sue the Saudis for involvement.
[01:09:05.151 --> 01:09:10.014]  James Beggar III, former Secretary of State for the Carlisle Group, comes in and represents them.
[01:09:10.074 --> 01:09:13.397]  I mean, I don't... So again, you're wrong there again, sir.
[01:09:14.306 --> 01:09:17.068]  I mean, you're wrong at every step of the way!
[01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:19.270]  Oh, man.
[01:09:20.851 --> 01:09:22.453]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:09:22.513 --> 01:09:25.996]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Louisiana.
[01:09:26.036 --> 01:09:26.536]  Mike, go ahead.
[01:09:28.398 --> 01:09:28.818]  Hello?
[01:09:29.519 --> 01:09:30.279]  Mike in L.A.
[01:09:30.339 --> 01:09:32.481]  Excuse me, I missed the... No problem, Alex.
[01:09:32.561 --> 01:09:33.682]  Yeah, I'm in L.A.
[01:09:33.742 --> 01:09:34.203]  actually.
[01:09:34.523 --> 01:09:35.323]  Too bad you're not out here.
[01:09:35.343 --> 01:09:35.744]  I wish you...
[01:09:36.232 --> 01:09:38.333]  Wish we could get you here in Los Angeles area.
[01:09:38.433 --> 01:09:39.414]  Actually, where do you live in L.A.?
[01:09:39.534 --> 01:09:44.297]  I'm on a station by San Diego, and it covers about half of L.A.
[01:09:44.337 --> 01:09:45.698]  You must not live in southern L.A.
[01:09:46.238 --> 01:09:46.979]  No, I do, I do.
[01:09:46.999 --> 01:09:47.799]  I live in L.A.
[01:09:47.859 --> 01:09:50.261]  County, but 1050 U.S.A.
[01:09:50.301 --> 01:09:54.303]  Radio here in Riverside is the only place to hear you if I'm in Riverside County.
[01:09:54.883 --> 01:09:55.324]  Not L.A.
[01:09:55.364 --> 01:09:55.584]  County.
[01:09:57.793 --> 01:09:58.474]  I was in L.A.
[01:09:58.494 --> 01:09:59.134]  and picked it up.
[01:09:59.994 --> 01:10:00.274]  Really?
[01:10:00.634 --> 01:10:01.775]  Go to the affiliate list.
[01:10:01.835 --> 01:10:02.975]  It's on the network site.
[01:10:03.555 --> 01:10:05.536]  What is that affiliate there at John Wayne Airport?
[01:10:05.576 --> 01:10:06.616]  You guys looked that up for me.
[01:10:06.676 --> 01:10:07.436]  It's a great station.
[01:10:07.476 --> 01:10:08.257]  We're on there right now.
[01:10:08.317 --> 01:10:09.777]  I'm going, what's that affiliate?
[01:10:11.658 --> 01:10:13.458]  No, I'd love to know what it is.
[01:10:13.518 --> 01:10:15.119]  I'll turn into AM Station.
[01:10:15.399 --> 01:10:21.180]  What I called about four months ago about the one and only Joe Bannister and his trials coming up.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:22.501]  I thought you might try to get the word out.
[01:10:23.396 --> 01:10:28.881]  You know, I've called Joe about five times and he just must be so busy he's not calling me back.
[01:10:29.461 --> 01:10:32.264]  For those who don't know who he is, tell folks.
[01:10:33.805 --> 01:10:35.066]  Oh, no, no problem.
[01:10:35.426 --> 01:10:47.417]  IRS agent, you know, carried a badging gun, checked out the law about the income tax, disagreed with what the IRS was doing, you know, all the unconstitutional things they're doing, due process, whatever.
[01:10:48.135 --> 01:10:49.135]  And left the IRS?
[01:10:49.215 --> 01:10:50.696]  I mean, there's more to that.
[01:10:51.076 --> 01:10:54.877]  Well, he did all I would ask peace officers to do.
[01:10:54.917 --> 01:11:02.660]  He was a treasury agent assigned to the IRS, very senior, like basically the head guy up in his area, and he heard D.B.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.641]  Kidd on a talk show
[01:11:06.694 --> 01:11:11.336]  Uh, and I again went to California and interviewed him there personally, and heard her make all these claims.
[01:11:11.376 --> 01:11:31.602]  He wrote notes, spent two years investigating it, found out the 16th Amendment was never ratified, giving us the income tax, uh, found out it was an offshore corporation, the District of Columbia, uh, incorporated, found out it all was literally a dictatorship, went to his superiors, wrote a big 90-page brief, and said, please respond, or I'm gonna have to resign.
[01:11:31.622 --> 01:11:32.482]  They said, resign.
[01:11:33.425 --> 01:11:38.429]  And then he went public and protested and went to Congress, and boy, they came and arrested him.
[01:11:38.449 --> 01:11:41.171]  Anything else?
[01:11:41.191 --> 01:11:46.995]  I just want to say, if you could follow him, his court case, I believe, is like the 10th or 12th, 15th of this month.
[01:11:47.495 --> 01:11:49.457]  You know, if you could follow that, I'd get the word out.
[01:11:49.477 --> 01:11:50.277]  That's all I care about.
[01:11:50.317 --> 01:11:51.418]  I know he's sending emails out.
[01:11:51.438 --> 01:11:52.019]  I'm getting those.
[01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:52.959]  So, thanks a lot, Bill.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.020]  Thank you.
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.442]  Yeah, why don't you, uh, thanks for the call.
[01:11:57.363 --> 01:11:58.984]  Do me a favor so I don't forget, John.
[01:12:00.134 --> 01:12:06.916]  Instant message my wife, who happens to be my producer too, and tell her to just start calling Joe Bannister three times a day.
[01:12:08.276 --> 01:12:14.158]  Yeah, because I've been trying, I call every few months and I don't know what's going on.
[01:12:14.198 --> 01:12:16.899]  I know he's really, really busy and probably getting ready for his case.
[01:12:17.779 --> 01:12:20.500]  But yeah, I want Joe on this broadcast.
[01:12:22.021 --> 01:12:25.762]  I'll tell you up front folks, and it doesn't mean they won't come after me, but I pay taxes.
[01:12:25.862 --> 01:12:26.722]  I pay the income tax.
[01:12:28.118 --> 01:12:29.898]  And people will get howling mad.
[01:12:30.239 --> 01:12:31.439]  You're funding the enemy!
[01:12:31.459 --> 01:12:32.959]  You're funding our destruction!
[01:12:33.359 --> 01:12:34.239]  Look at you!
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.460]  You're a traitor!
[01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:36.440]  You know it's a fraud!
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.160]  You're paying it!
[01:12:38.941 --> 01:12:40.421]  One must pick his battles.
[01:12:41.961 --> 01:12:43.622]  One must pick his battles.
[01:12:46.042 --> 01:12:48.343]  And it's simple.
[01:12:49.083 --> 01:12:50.423]  You know, I got the Quicken account.
[01:12:50.523 --> 01:12:51.664]  I've got an accountant.
[01:12:54.452 --> 01:13:00.156]  And, you know, you can set Quicken for stuff that's risky, stuff that's medium, stuff that makes you totally in the clear.
[01:13:00.536 --> 01:13:01.136]  Well, I do that.
[01:13:01.156 --> 01:13:02.978]  I mean, I end up paying more money.
[01:13:03.798 --> 01:13:06.640]  Because if they're ever going to frame me for something, they're going to have to do it out in the open.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.402]  Of course I could quit paying the income tax.
[01:13:09.422 --> 01:13:10.943]  There's all these other constitutional taxes.
[01:13:11.223 --> 01:13:13.024]  Of course it goes right into the Mafia's hands.
[01:13:13.884 --> 01:13:17.847]  But again, I pick my fights, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:18.267 --> 01:13:22.650]  And I am not a... I mean, I cross every T, dot every I,
[01:13:23.950 --> 01:13:28.471]  I don't dump motor oil down the gutter.
[01:13:28.631 --> 01:13:30.551]  I do speed.
[01:13:30.591 --> 01:13:32.192]  I've cut back on that, by the way.
[01:13:32.812 --> 01:13:37.032]  Ever since a tornado blew me off the road, I've been driving a little bit slower.
[01:13:38.733 --> 01:13:39.193]  It's simple.
[01:13:39.733 --> 01:13:42.473]  I pick my fights because I've had all the experts on.
[01:13:42.553 --> 01:13:43.353]  I've read all the books.
[01:13:43.493 --> 01:13:47.214]  I've got the State Attorney General documents and the Secretary of State.
[01:13:47.614 --> 01:13:48.774]  I know they didn't ratify it.
[01:13:48.814 --> 01:13:50.955]  I've had former Congressmen on talking about it.
[01:13:51.415 --> 01:13:52.155]  I know it's a fraud.
[01:13:54.139 --> 01:13:59.722]  But I was really fighting the IRS about five years ago, well really two years ago, but I looked at it.
[01:14:00.142 --> 01:14:01.863]  They're going to get rid of the income tax.
[01:14:02.963 --> 01:14:05.064]  That is, they're going to ratchet it down and call it something else.
[01:14:05.525 --> 01:14:10.307]  And they're going to bring in a sales tax that's graduated and it'll be connected to your ID card.
[01:14:10.327 --> 01:14:14.549]  It'll bring federal regulation into every terminal, every cash register.
[01:14:14.929 --> 01:14:17.550]  So I, again, see the new threat.
[01:14:19.311 --> 01:14:20.252]  I understand that
[01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:23.812]  It's a waste of time and energy, quite frankly.
[01:14:24.333 --> 01:14:33.123]  Now, again, if you're some little fry out there, don't want to pay income taxes, and know it's a fraud, and can't even feed your family if you did pay it, the economy's so bad, I'm not blaming you.
[01:14:33.163 --> 01:14:34.184]  I'm saying you're in the right.
[01:14:35.165 --> 01:14:36.407]  But, there is a chance
[01:14:37.344 --> 01:14:40.405]  Especially if you're a big fish, you know, in this movement, that they will come after you.
[01:14:40.465 --> 01:14:42.985]  Those tax courts aren't even real courts.
[01:14:43.485 --> 01:14:44.826]  You don't even get a jury, folks.
[01:14:44.886 --> 01:14:46.026]  It's a total fraud.
[01:14:46.546 --> 01:14:49.507]  And a lot of good men and women have gone to prison over this.
[01:14:49.567 --> 01:14:51.487]  And I'm not going to sit here and give you the advice to do this.
[01:14:52.247 --> 01:14:54.788]  And then sit there and suck my thumb when you go to jail.
[01:14:55.888 --> 01:14:56.248]  Okay?
[01:14:56.808 --> 01:15:03.210]  I mean, you could talk about, you know, you're a state citizen, and you've pulled out of the faking corporation, and you're not under admiralty.
[01:15:03.530 --> 01:15:04.590]  They don't listen to that!
[01:15:05.808 --> 01:15:07.709]  They don't follow their own rules, okay?
[01:15:07.729 --> 01:15:10.150]  I mean, all that stuff's real, okay?
[01:15:11.331 --> 01:15:21.857]  But again, they're so past that it is the law of the machine gun, law of the black boot, law of the... I'm here to get the word out.
[01:15:22.037 --> 01:15:23.238]  I'm here to cover the news.
[01:15:23.458 --> 01:15:24.819]  I'm here to expose what's happening.
[01:15:24.939 --> 01:15:28.041]  I am not here to not pay the income tax.
[01:15:29.021 --> 01:15:29.702]  I'll say it again.
[01:15:30.202 --> 01:15:32.103]  I pay my income taxes.
[01:15:32.941 --> 01:15:38.222]  Because, frankly, the statement that we're funding the enemy at its base is not true.
[01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:40.163]  It's not true, folks.
[01:15:40.523 --> 01:15:42.723]  The globalists print the money.
[01:15:43.384 --> 01:15:44.784]  They make the money.
[01:15:45.444 --> 01:15:48.425]  The income tax is a mode of social control.
[01:15:51.486 --> 01:15:55.807]  The Federal Reserve is printing so much money right now, there is a real danger of a depression.
[01:15:55.927 --> 01:15:59.948]  I don't know if it's going to happen, but we're in, you know, we're like 1929 Germany right now.
[01:16:03.407 --> 01:16:06.969]  Things are very precarious.
[01:16:07.109 --> 01:16:09.110]  America is like an airplane.
[01:16:09.130 --> 01:16:10.150]  The western world is.
[01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:12.291]  It's got four engines and three of them around.
[01:16:13.511 --> 01:16:15.292]  The tail section is about to break off.
[01:16:16.232 --> 01:16:17.573]  I don't know if they can land this thing.
[01:16:17.593 --> 01:16:19.134]  I don't know if they want to land this thing.
[01:16:20.674 --> 01:16:25.076]  Or are they just trying to suck us deeper into debt and deeper down a rat hole before they punish the button?
[01:16:27.068 --> 01:16:32.453]  Now, I think it's important to expose the IRS and expose how it's a fraud and expose how it's extortion and expose how it's criminal.
[01:16:33.354 --> 01:16:38.398]  So you can shoot your mouth off all day, I'm a big coward, and because I pay income taxes.
[01:16:39.159 --> 01:16:40.720]  No, I've chosen my battles.
[01:16:41.881 --> 01:16:46.705]  And, uh, I don't, contrary to popular belief, I don't make that much money after expenses.
[01:16:47.406 --> 01:16:49.548]  A lot of other money comes in, but it all goes out.
[01:16:50.148 --> 01:16:50.729]  Literally.
[01:16:51.229 --> 01:16:52.891]  So, I don't, it's not even that much money.
[01:16:55.319 --> 01:17:09.822]  I mean, the toll roads, and the sales tax, and the... all of that is going to dwarf, is going to absolutely eclipse, by many orders of magnitude, the income tax.
[01:17:11.403 --> 01:17:16.884]  The income tax is a little, you know, 1913 fraud, and its days are numbered.
[01:17:17.324 --> 01:17:21.825]  And in the middle of the counter-revolution against the income tax, they're gonna, you know,
[01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:24.913]  Give up the devil you know for a devil you don't know.
[01:17:24.933 --> 01:17:32.980]  They're going to get rid of a case of shingles and get a case of metastasized cancer.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:33.921]  That's my analogy.
[01:17:33.941 --> 01:17:44.830]  They're going to get rid of a case of gout or a case of ulcers and get a gigantic brain tumor to replace it.
[01:17:47.782 --> 01:17:53.946]  So, okay, I know the guys out there that talk about common law and, you know, how they're sovereign and all this stuff.
[01:17:55.648 --> 01:17:58.250]  They got the... it's almost like alchemy or something.
[01:17:58.630 --> 01:18:01.632]  Look, look, law is whatever machine gun backs it up.
[01:18:02.192 --> 01:18:04.094]  Law is you standing up against tyranny.
[01:18:04.374 --> 01:18:06.976]  Law is you enforcing the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:18:08.637 --> 01:18:11.759]  So it doesn't do anything to the New World Order to not pay taxes.
[01:18:11.779 --> 01:18:12.980]  They just print more money, folks.
[01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.021]  It is a complete joke.
[01:18:15.717 --> 01:18:16.517]  Well, that's not really true.
[01:18:16.557 --> 01:18:19.779]  It allows you to keep more of the military script that you know as Federal Reserve notes.
[01:18:19.999 --> 01:18:21.880]  It allows you to take care of you and your family.
[01:18:22.881 --> 01:18:25.902]  And does cut a lot of control they have over you.
[01:18:25.942 --> 01:18:31.165]  So, it is very helpful, but in a certain sector of things.
[01:18:32.426 --> 01:18:32.726]  Okay?
[01:18:33.566 --> 01:18:34.967]  So, I stand corrected.
[01:18:36.148 --> 01:18:38.629]  But you've got to have three-dimensional analysis of all of this.
[01:18:38.789 --> 01:18:41.430]  And I know some people don't want to believe me, so fine.
[01:18:41.470 --> 01:18:42.411]  Don't listen to me.
[01:18:43.044 --> 01:18:47.905]  We'll come back, accelerate through phone calls, cover a bunch of news, play part of this goofy phone call, and a lot more.
[01:18:48.185 --> 01:18:50.085]  PresentPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com.
[01:18:50.105 --> 01:18:50.486]  Stay with us.

[01:19:53.266 --> 01:19:58.670]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment, ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:07.117]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals, and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[01:20:07.357 --> 01:20:08.958]  More than likely, this includes you.

[01:20:53.375 --> 01:20:57.278]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:20:57.498 --> 01:21:09.787]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:10.608]  The U.S.
[01:21:10.648 --> 01:21:16.232]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:21:16.632 --> 01:21:18.834]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:21:20.695 --> 01:21:21.756]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:21:21.796 --> 01:21:24.637]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:21:24.737 --> 01:21:30.780]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[01:22:50.455 --> 01:22:59.760]  And there is one more good thing about
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:13.882]  30 to 45 million, no one really knows the true number, that's the different federal numbers, 30 to 45 million, different numbers for different things, but it's over 30 million, are not paying income taxes, are not filing.
[01:23:14.002 --> 01:23:19.343]  The globalists just print more money, but it does show people are resisting, they know it's a fraud, they're saying no.
[01:23:19.944 --> 01:23:21.044]  And I can always commend that.
[01:23:21.164 --> 01:23:26.185]  I'm just going to tell you, do it at your own risk, because you can pay extra taxes and they'll still come after you.
[01:23:27.405 --> 01:23:29.766]  An IRS agent told my dad back in like 1987 or something,
[01:23:32.851 --> 01:23:34.712]  They said, Mr. Jones, we don't want your receipts.
[01:23:34.752 --> 01:23:36.433]  We don't want... It doesn't matter.
[01:23:37.054 --> 01:23:38.855]  We are organized criminals.
[01:23:39.555 --> 01:23:44.158]  Folks, I swear to you, my dad never engages in BS.
[01:23:44.758 --> 01:23:48.720]  I remember my dad coming home, wide as a ghost, going, they told me they were criminals.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:50.781]  They told me they were criminals.
[01:23:52.242 --> 01:23:53.523]  Well, you see?
[01:23:53.543 --> 01:23:59.046]  And I watched the IRS literally suck everything out of my dad.
[01:24:00.467 --> 01:24:05.388]  So the point is, is that you can pay them, you can't pay them, you can whatever, they'll still come after you.
[01:24:06.349 --> 01:24:13.611]  But they've gotten in so much trouble over the fact that they abused so many people.
[01:24:13.831 --> 01:24:21.513]  They took diamond rings off 80-year-old women's fingers and then the old husband went in and blew his head off so his family could get the insurance policy.
[01:24:22.413 --> 01:24:24.094]  You know, hundreds of suicides related.
[01:24:25.646 --> 01:24:30.287]  You've got to ask yourself, why did the media suddenly, even mainstream, start exposing them in the last five years?
[01:24:30.307 --> 01:24:32.828]  Because they're getting ready to bring out a new system.
[01:24:34.989 --> 01:24:43.991]  So, if the IRS wants to do something with me, I've got an accountant, I've got all the books, all the receipts, and they've never messed with me.
[01:24:45.271 --> 01:24:47.332]  And I can sit there and expose them as criminals they are.
[01:24:48.532 --> 01:24:49.433]  You see how that works?
[01:24:49.493 --> 01:24:54.294]  But then I know all these people who shoot their mouths off, and who go, I'm not paying them!
[01:24:55.242 --> 01:24:56.402]  And man, they go to jail.
[01:24:56.542 --> 01:24:57.963]  And it is a fraud!
[01:24:58.683 --> 01:24:59.703]  It's a kangaroo court.
[01:25:00.283 --> 01:25:02.424]  So I'm not going to stick my head in that lion's jaws.
[01:25:03.084 --> 01:25:05.865]  If they want to do it, they're going to have to do it right out in the open.
[01:25:06.285 --> 01:25:09.446]  And so many people don't fight the government because they're afraid of the IRS.
[01:25:09.506 --> 01:25:10.846]  You know, don't be afraid of them, folks.
[01:25:11.986 --> 01:25:16.787]  Most IRS agents I talk to, because a lot of them are listeners of this show, they know it's a fraud.
[01:25:16.827 --> 01:25:17.988]  They're all freaked out.
[01:25:18.268 --> 01:25:19.828]  Their morale's falling apart.
[01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:23.489]  And so the globalists are going to bring you a new fraud.
[01:25:24.361 --> 01:25:26.682]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:25:27.663 --> 01:25:29.284]  But I can't say you're bad for not paying.
[01:25:29.464 --> 01:25:30.624]  I mean, you're in the right.
[01:25:31.485 --> 01:25:33.606]  I'm just telling you, these people don't follow their own laws.
[01:25:34.366 --> 01:25:36.367]  There is no law that you've got to pay income tax.
[01:25:36.387 --> 01:25:37.508]  They catch you in other things.
[01:25:39.289 --> 01:25:40.589]  Let's talk to Don in Texas.
[01:25:40.629 --> 01:25:41.330]  Don, go ahead.
[01:25:43.191 --> 01:25:43.491]  Hi there.
[01:25:44.191 --> 01:25:45.392]  Am I on the line?
[01:25:45.532 --> 01:25:46.172]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:25:46.672 --> 01:25:49.894]  Okay, hey, sorry, by the way, that guy, that Chris guy,
[01:25:50.686 --> 01:25:55.709]  He's a very polished, well-rehearsed professional.
[01:25:56.169 --> 01:26:02.152]  You can't call him a provocateur, but he's a professional.
[01:26:02.192 --> 01:26:04.853]  He tries to put you back on your heels.
[01:26:06.014 --> 01:26:08.595]  So you think he's a seminar caller?
[01:26:08.955 --> 01:26:12.517]  He's beautiful as far as his expertise.
[01:26:13.024 --> 01:26:15.325]  But I hope you can recognize these people.
[01:26:16.305 --> 01:26:19.246]  They call in about immigration things.
[01:26:19.866 --> 01:26:24.107]  They make lies sound like the truth, and they're very slick.
[01:26:24.747 --> 01:26:27.428]  The reason I call in, actually, is the mercenary movement.
[01:26:27.788 --> 01:26:32.310]  You know, the Soldier of Fortune, the Freebooters that are over in Iraq.
[01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:33.590]  You're aware of them, aren't you?
[01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:35.791]  I love the fact you used the word Freeboot.
[01:26:36.311 --> 01:26:37.531]  We've got to keep that alive.
[01:26:37.971 --> 01:26:39.932]  Well, there's about five different kinds of
[01:26:40.879 --> 01:26:54.029]  About these people and some of them are adventurers, kind of like, you know, the soldier, I mean, the French Foreign Legion that they have, uh, they like to, you know... Then you have the private companies that they call Jackals, Bechtel and... Jackals, yeah.
[01:26:54.349 --> 01:27:03.435]  Halliburton, they've all got them, and they're... Well, Jackals, I mean, uh, Halliburton has taken, uh, Titan under its wings, you know, and, uh, to hide them.
[01:27:03.636 --> 01:27:04.776]  Yeah, Titan security.
[01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:06.618]  And, and, well, they call them security.
[01:27:06.658 --> 01:27:08.179]  They're, they're, they're guys that like to,
[01:27:08.757 --> 01:27:09.077]  I think so.
[01:27:29.733 --> 01:27:31.294]  Well, I mean, I'm not trying to be nasty.
[01:27:31.434 --> 01:27:36.477]  No, we can't mention a lot of the terrorism that's going on in the camps.
[01:27:36.557 --> 01:27:37.398]  It's just too graphic.
[01:27:37.698 --> 01:27:49.165]  Well, you don't get the sources, you know, I mean, I'm not... Well, no, the official Army reports says that they put battery acid on objects and then do things with them.
[01:27:49.185 --> 01:27:54.188]  They have people that, and I'm not against Israel, I'm not, you know, but I think in the
[01:27:57.853 --> 01:28:08.637]  One of the major newspapers in Israel, I think in 1984, admitted that they had 7,000 prisoners had been killed, tortured to death.
[01:28:09.917 --> 01:28:11.038]  You've heard of that?
[01:28:11.098 --> 01:28:14.519]  Israel openly has a law that they quote are allowed to torture.
[01:28:16.275 --> 01:28:21.198]  I'm part Jewish, and you know... Sir, you can say that you don't like Israel.
[01:28:21.758 --> 01:28:22.919]  I don't like what Israel does.
[01:28:22.959 --> 01:28:24.400]  I think it's run by a bunch of crooks.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:27.201]  Half of Israel are beautiful people.
[01:28:29.503 --> 01:28:30.083]  Exactly.
[01:28:30.463 --> 01:28:32.864]  There are different camps, and that's what needs to be pointed out.
[01:28:33.084 --> 01:28:33.425]  You know what?
[01:28:33.465 --> 01:28:34.005]  Stay there, Don.
[01:28:34.025 --> 01:28:37.687]  I'm going to let you finish up, then we'll play this clip with more on here in just a second.
[01:28:44.091 --> 01:28:47.094]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.015 --> 01:28:50.698]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.308 --> 01:28:56.909]  You've heard it over and over again.
[01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:59.609]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[01:28:59.950 --> 01:29:03.611]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[01:29:03.911 --> 01:29:08.772]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[01:29:09.092 --> 01:29:09.793]  Don't wait for when.
[01:29:10.053 --> 01:29:11.153]  It's important to act now.

[01:29:53.658 --> 01:29:55.259]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.399 --> 01:29:59.500]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:02.521]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.601 --> 01:30:09.323]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.503 --> 01:30:12.504]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.704 --> 01:30:15.105]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.225 --> 01:30:23.128]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:30:23.288 --> 01:30:34.710]  Atrazine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, Foul taste and obnoxious odors like Sulfur, even Nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum aren't extracted.
[01:30:34.850 --> 01:30:42.791]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:31:19.331 --> 01:31:24.675]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[01:31:40.349 --> 01:31:41.150]  Alright, Don and uh...
[01:32:06.431 --> 01:32:08.692]  Joel and Russell and many others, your calls are coming up.
[01:32:08.712 --> 01:32:10.894]  I want to play part of this moron call.
[01:32:10.914 --> 01:32:13.975]  I don't know, I think the guy was just in deep denial.
[01:32:14.015 --> 01:32:25.082]  You think he's a setup or something, but Don, Mercs, Freebooters, Men of Fortune, Piratical, Jolly Roger, Flying Globalist.
[01:32:25.982 --> 01:32:28.164]  You know, that's the maximum of skull and bones.
[01:32:28.364 --> 01:32:32.046]  You know, you were a thief, you were a pirate, you were a prince, you were a king, you were a lord.
[01:32:32.819 --> 01:32:33.839]  They're into all of this.
[01:32:33.859 --> 01:32:34.959]  You know, they're men of fortune.
[01:32:35.339 --> 01:32:37.240]  And they get off on it and they enjoy it.
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:44.461]  Some of them, you know, are kind of like your, to use an analogy, your Han Solo type who aren't really bad, but a lot of them really are evil.
[01:32:45.121 --> 01:32:50.102]  And they've got huge, tens of thousands of mercs running.
[01:32:50.662 --> 01:32:56.723]  The government of Mohammed Karzai, the UNICAL executive, they're in Afghanistan.
[01:32:57.063 --> 01:32:58.904]  You've got them basically running in Iraq.
[01:32:59.564 --> 01:33:00.684]  Hundreds of them have been killed.
[01:33:01.761 --> 01:33:12.272]  And a lot of times it's mercs that will be with our troops and will open fire on whole crowds of citizens, innocent Iraqis, a lot of the big massacres.
[01:33:13.052 --> 01:33:17.417]  And now they can't find enough evil Americans so they're getting all the former death squad commanders.
[01:33:18.689 --> 01:33:37.794]  From Latin America, did you hear that Silica Stillo DEA agent interview about they're training the Los Zetas, Mexican special forces that are killing US police officers and hundreds of other citizens, training in South Texas ranches, and they're enforcers for Bush after smaller cartels that aren't paying their cut?
[01:33:39.434 --> 01:33:40.374]  Did you hear that, Don?
[01:33:41.334 --> 01:33:43.795]  Hey, by the way, you've heard of the MS-13, you know, the
[01:33:44.876 --> 01:33:46.937]  The killer, you know, the gang guys?
[01:33:47.137 --> 01:33:47.417]  Yes.
[01:33:47.737 --> 01:33:50.319]  And they got their colorful uniform.
[01:33:51.579 --> 01:34:03.945]  I go to a lot of the little, I speak Spanish pretty well, and I like Spanish people, and I see them in Austin, here and there with an entourage, and it's like nothing's done about them.
[01:34:03.965 --> 01:34:04.825]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:34:04.865 --> 01:34:05.806]  It's pretty insidious.
[01:34:06.286 --> 01:34:10.648]  Now, the thing about getting off on Mexico,
[01:34:11.209 --> 01:34:27.902]  Some of the incendiary literature that they hear, and a lot of these people aren't educated, that could cause some of the Hispanic people to be almost as evil as the terrorists, you might call them, because it's a matter of emotion.
[01:34:28.342 --> 01:34:34.446]  I know, and our government, this is what wakes them up, our government funds that incendiary literature.
[01:34:34.486 --> 01:34:35.067]  Thanks for the call.
[01:34:36.864 --> 01:34:37.525]  Absolutely.
[01:34:37.925 --> 01:34:39.546]  And these people really are freebooters.
[01:34:39.946 --> 01:34:43.108]  A freebooter is a naval mercenary.
[01:34:44.089 --> 01:34:47.592]  That's the particular connotation for that term.
[01:34:48.192 --> 01:34:49.273]  That's what it notes.
[01:34:50.233 --> 01:34:51.794]  Here is part of the call.
[01:34:51.814 --> 01:34:54.116]  I can't air the whole thing, but I'll air part of it.
[01:34:54.536 --> 01:35:03.783]  Here's the call with this listener yesterday who was just in complete and total denial, or was a stoolie for the globalists.
[01:35:03.803 --> 01:35:04.123]  Here it is.
[01:35:06.098 --> 01:35:12.122]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:35:12.722 --> 01:35:15.764]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:35:16.785 --> 01:35:21.708]  We're talking to a real American patriot, Celica Stillo, a Vietnam veteran, how a decorated sniper.
[01:35:22.757 --> 01:35:28.843]  Then he worked his way up as a law enforcement officer, peace officer in the police department in South Texas.
[01:35:28.863 --> 01:35:34.268]  Then he got into the DEA and in 12 years became the head of their Latin American operations.
[01:35:34.768 --> 01:35:35.709]  Oh, yes.
[01:35:35.729 --> 01:35:37.210]  Let's stop this right now.
[01:35:37.931 --> 01:35:39.352]  Let's stop this right now, please.
[01:35:39.372 --> 01:35:43.876]  I guess the computer misfired because during the break I was listening to the call.
[01:35:44.477 --> 01:35:49.041]  It's yesterday, eight minutes into the last hour is where we started.
[01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:52.760]  That was from the day before yesterday with Sully Castillo.
[01:35:53.381 --> 01:35:55.383]  The DEA agent, not the moron caller.
[01:35:56.123 --> 01:35:58.525]  So let's make clear, that's not who we're talking about.
[01:36:00.047 --> 01:36:01.288]  I love these computers, folks.
[01:36:01.348 --> 01:36:03.049]  Do you have the real clip now?
[01:36:05.391 --> 01:36:09.575]  Well, I mean, you were just playing it for me a minute ago during the break.
[01:36:10.575 --> 01:36:13.478]  No, it's not the same one.
[01:36:15.399 --> 01:36:17.121]  Okay, well maybe we just won't do that then.
[01:36:18.170 --> 01:36:20.131]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joel in Wisconsin.
[01:36:20.171 --> 01:36:20.851]  Joel, go ahead.
[01:36:20.871 --> 01:36:21.371]  You're on the air.
[01:36:21.391 --> 01:36:22.312]  Hi Alex.
[01:36:23.212 --> 01:36:26.853]  Kudos for the Charles Gaudier interview you had.
[01:36:28.134 --> 01:36:28.934]  Two things for you.
[01:36:29.855 --> 01:36:34.336]  Tuesday we had a seminar on campus about countering anti-Americanism.
[01:36:37.021 --> 01:36:38.742]  And they had four speakers.
[01:36:38.862 --> 01:36:40.923]  One of them was Russ Feingold, Senator.
[01:36:41.604 --> 01:36:43.965]  Robert Ricliano, Elizabeth Turpin.
[01:36:44.045 --> 01:36:46.006]  She was from the Henry L. Stimson Center.
[01:36:46.546 --> 01:36:47.467]  I don't know about that.
[01:36:48.047 --> 01:36:52.929]  There's Julius Zweig, who is from the CFR, or has ties to it.
[01:36:53.810 --> 01:37:03.775]  And I got the main focus of what they were saying was, we just need a private citizen PR goodwill campaign exchange program with other countries.
[01:37:03.795 --> 01:37:03.855]  And
[01:37:06.784 --> 01:37:17.972]  It just sounded a little weird, but if you want to get the clip, Senator Feingold actually came out and said the reason why we're in Iraq is to protect our interests.
[01:37:18.872 --> 01:37:19.893]  And my jaw dropped.
[01:37:20.353 --> 01:37:26.017]  No, I mean, the Naval War College comes right out and says it.
[01:37:26.458 --> 01:37:27.618]  The Pentagon says it.
[01:37:27.678 --> 01:37:31.341]  It's all admitted except when they're on the nightly news they tell us, oh no, that's ridiculous.
[01:37:32.577 --> 01:37:47.025]  Well, this was through the Institute of World Affairs, and if you want, it was rebroadcast, and it should be in an audio clip, through WUWM.
[01:37:47.125 --> 01:37:48.366]  Oh, and they say it every day.
[01:37:48.386 --> 01:37:53.429]  They say, we're an empire, we're taking over, the people will be our slaves in America.
[01:37:54.102 --> 01:38:03.646]  But there was the contrast between we are there to protect our interests, the oil, and then, oh, we just need to do a private citizen PR campaign.
[01:38:04.526 --> 01:38:06.667]  And the two just did not mesh.
[01:38:07.067 --> 01:38:20.013]  And one of the speakers, Julius Weig from the CFR, she was saying that the view that other citizens of the world have of us is a caricature
[01:38:21.059 --> 01:38:28.462]  And I thought, well, if I square up what Senator Feingold said with what she's saying, no wonder.
[01:38:28.962 --> 01:38:31.222]  Oh yeah, they're saying it's an empowerment, but they're saying it's not.
[01:38:31.242 --> 01:38:31.883]  Thanks for the call.
[01:38:33.103 --> 01:38:33.763]  Here's an example.
[01:38:33.843 --> 01:38:41.986]  Fears over CIA university spies, BBC, a CIA scheme to sponsor trainee spies secretly throughout U.S.
[01:38:42.046 --> 01:38:44.327]  university courses has caused anger among U.K.
[01:38:44.387 --> 01:38:44.887]  academics.
[01:38:45.507 --> 01:38:46.748]  Because now they're going to do it in the U.K.
[01:38:46.768 --> 01:38:46.908]  too.
[01:38:46.928 --> 01:38:47.988]  This has been going on forever.
[01:38:49.004 --> 01:38:56.369]  90% of university funding now, in sciences, is blank budget, you know, secret government option in DARPA.
[01:38:57.230 --> 01:38:56.369]  90%.
[01:38:57.550 --> 01:39:05.915]  Now they're taking over even anthropology, media classes, basically, and they're giving them $50,000 a year.
[01:39:05.935 --> 01:39:09.638]  That's $25,000 to pay for the courses, and another $25,000 to live on, folks.
[01:39:09.658 --> 01:39:10.478]  I mean, expenses.
[01:39:16.952 --> 01:39:22.958]  And they're becoming secret CIA assets on the school grounds, and then to be sent around the world.
[01:39:23.538 --> 01:39:28.002]  And now we're taking our tax money to do this in England.
[01:39:29.063 --> 01:39:30.464]  And this has been going on for a long time.
[01:39:30.545 --> 01:39:36.350]  Now they're just, I mean, folks, they'll spend $200 and something million on one package of fake newscasts telling you how great
[01:39:36.986 --> 01:39:39.809]  The Medicare-Medicaid prescription drug plan is.
[01:39:39.829 --> 01:39:46.697]  I mean, they're spending billions on this stuff, and they have to buy people to go then and be their little spies.
[01:39:48.562 --> 01:40:11.057]  Oh man, and then these young 20-year-olds and they get their little CIA pass and they feel all powerful and it says they have to be all secret and they go home and watch CSI Miami where they torture people and where they take people's rights away and they image with that and bond with that and it says they have to go to CIA summer camps secretly every summer and tens of thousands of these people
[01:40:12.151 --> 01:40:13.133]  They're going to be everywhere.
[01:40:13.233 --> 01:40:14.896]  They're already here, but more and more of them.
[01:40:15.076 --> 01:40:15.637]  Armies of them.
[01:40:15.898 --> 01:40:17.020]  Alright, we did get the clip.
[01:40:17.060 --> 01:40:19.825]  Now here is the proper clip with the caller yesterday.
[01:40:19.885 --> 01:40:20.506]  Go ahead and roll it.
[01:40:22.319 --> 01:40:24.500]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.941]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:32.883]  Alright, loaded phone lines here.
[01:40:32.923 --> 01:40:34.083]  We're doing everybody's calls.
[01:40:34.103 --> 01:40:35.884]  Spend a few more minutes with Chris in Texas.
[01:40:37.024 --> 01:40:42.026]  And Chris, if you called up and said, Alex, you got a date wrong in your documentary, you know, I'd go fix it.
[01:40:42.186 --> 01:40:43.006]  I've done stuff like that.
[01:40:43.046 --> 01:40:45.527]  Or, Alex, you're wrong about this bill number.
[01:40:45.607 --> 01:40:49.368]  Or, Alex, I don't see that interpretation of Section 802 that you see.
[01:40:49.568 --> 01:40:51.709]  Well, here, let's read the subsection and see who's right.
[01:40:52.532 --> 01:40:57.835]  But instead you just go, I don't believe, you have belief, you have faith that George Bush knew anything about 9-11.
[01:40:58.135 --> 01:41:01.036]  Their own memo is public that they knew all the details.
[01:41:01.076 --> 01:41:02.537]  They ordered FBI to stand down.
[01:41:02.797 --> 01:41:04.778]  He signed W1999.
[01:41:05.438 --> 01:41:08.280]  They flew the bin Ladens out of the country in the days after.
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:13.102]  They're in the Carlisle Group, Jim Bush running security on the buildings.
[01:41:13.442 --> 01:41:16.985]  Bush had the launch orders two days before 9-11 to attack Afghanistan.
[01:41:17.645 --> 01:41:17.986]  44,000 U.S.
[01:41:18.346 --> 01:41:21.288]  troops massing into Tajikistan, Uzbekistan.
[01:41:21.308 --> 01:41:21.869]  18,000 British troops.
[01:41:21.889 --> 01:41:24.791]  Two aircraft carriers entered that area one day before.
[01:41:25.411 --> 01:41:26.132]  On and on and on.
[01:41:26.292 --> 01:41:27.573]  NORAD drills that day.
[01:41:27.633 --> 01:41:30.695]  NORAD ordered to stand down drills of flying hijacked jets in the buildings.
[01:41:30.976 --> 01:41:34.558]  Mayor Willie Brown getting a call from Condoleezza Rice told not to fly to New York the night before.
[01:41:34.818 --> 01:41:35.899]  San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:41:36.440 --> 01:41:39.442]  On and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[01:41:39.502 --> 01:41:41.645]  I mean, let's address one at a time the things you say.
[01:41:41.665 --> 01:41:43.727]  You're saying you said George Bush didn't have any prior knowledge of 9-11.
[01:41:51.578 --> 01:41:52.578]  That is my belief, sir, yes.
[01:41:53.058 --> 01:41:53.939]  Your belief?
[01:41:54.219 --> 01:41:54.559]  Yes, sir.
[01:41:54.679 --> 01:41:56.620]  Do you believe in the Tooth Fairy?
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:57.460]  I have looked.
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:00.181]  Do you believe, do you believe in Santa Claus?
[01:42:00.201 --> 01:42:00.921]  Are you finished, sir?
[01:42:01.541 --> 01:42:03.882]  Listen, you're the one that's talking about fairy tales.
[01:42:03.902 --> 01:42:04.362]  I'm trying.
[01:42:04.402 --> 01:42:05.622]  You give me some facts.
[01:42:06.342 --> 01:42:10.324]  I'm going to say, if you want to make a believer out of me, sir, show me the smoking gun.
[01:42:10.364 --> 01:42:11.004]  I want to see it.
[01:42:11.724 --> 01:42:14.465]  Don't show me your little newspaper articles or magazine articles.
[01:42:14.505 --> 01:42:15.425]  What do you mean show me?
[01:42:15.485 --> 01:42:16.566]  You show me facts, sir.
[01:42:16.586 --> 01:42:18.006]  Show me a smoking gun.
[01:42:18.026 --> 01:42:21.287]  Just like show you gravity, the evidence of gravity is all around you.
[01:42:21.866 --> 01:42:23.467]  See, I've studied all the specifics.
[01:42:23.487 --> 01:42:25.849]  Sir, I've got the smoking guns for prior knowledge.
[01:42:25.889 --> 01:42:26.809]  They knew specifics.
[01:42:26.909 --> 01:42:28.610]  Plans to fly planes into buildings.
[01:42:28.931 --> 01:42:34.554]  In the next week, they knew he was given it in the CIA briefing and Rice lied and said they never got it.
[01:42:34.774 --> 01:42:35.695]  Okay, then let me ask you this.
[01:42:35.755 --> 01:42:37.616]  Why don't you take it to a federal grand jury?
[01:42:38.276 --> 01:42:38.877]  And have them indicted.
[01:42:38.897 --> 01:42:40.298]  We have called for that, sir.
[01:42:40.358 --> 01:42:43.660]  We have contacted grand juries, state and federal.
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:48.223]  We have done whole shows calling for grand juries to investigate.
[01:42:49.355 --> 01:42:50.216]  Uh-huh.
[01:42:50.516 --> 01:42:53.197]  I had Red Beckman on for two hours doing that two years ago.
[01:42:53.658 --> 01:42:59.141]  I've looked over this evidence that you claim that you have, and I've read it, and it amounts to nothing.
[01:42:59.681 --> 01:43:02.063]  Oh, so you just got the word nothing.
[01:43:02.903 --> 01:43:05.645]  Saying the word nothing doesn't make it nothing.
[01:43:05.905 --> 01:43:09.467]  If you were to take this to a federal grand jury, sir, they would laugh you out of the building.
[01:43:09.648 --> 01:43:10.228]  Sure they would.
[01:43:10.248 --> 01:43:11.549]  Because what you have amounts to nothing.
[01:43:11.569 --> 01:43:12.769]  Now you're talking about laughing.
[01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:14.030]  They would.
[01:43:14.070 --> 01:43:16.212]  You use these buzzwords, sir, they mean nothing.
[01:43:18.432 --> 01:43:20.615]  I am simply trying to tell you, sir, what I believe.
[01:43:20.635 --> 01:43:21.275]  Okay?
[01:43:21.496 --> 01:43:23.638]  Are you saying Operation Northwoods doesn't exist?
[01:43:23.658 --> 01:43:27.623]  The official government plan to carry out 9-11 style attacks to blame it on a foreign enemy?
[01:43:27.824 --> 01:43:29.085]  Hey, I know nothing of that, sir.
[01:43:29.606 --> 01:43:30.046]  Okay.
[01:43:30.227 --> 01:43:31.408]  I know nothing of that.
[01:43:31.448 --> 01:43:33.691]  Do you know about Operation Gladio that was carried out?
[01:43:34.601 --> 01:43:35.442]  No, sir, I know nothing of it.
[01:43:35.462 --> 01:43:39.684]  Do you know they now admit they blew up the main for the Spanish-American War in 1898 in Havana Harbor?
[01:43:40.104 --> 01:43:41.125]  No, sir, I know nothing of it.
[01:43:41.185 --> 01:43:44.407]  Do you know about Hitler burning his own Reichstag to blame it on his political enemies?
[01:43:44.847 --> 01:43:45.747]  Yes, I know about that.
[01:43:45.767 --> 01:43:50.490]  Do you know about Hitler staging an attack on a radio base on the Polish border and blaming it on the Poles?
[01:43:50.670 --> 01:43:52.291]  I know that Hitler was a madman, yes, sir.
[01:43:52.651 --> 01:43:55.713]  Do you know about the Hegelian dialectic of problem, reaction, solution?
[01:43:56.193 --> 01:43:56.973]  Uh, I can't say that I do.
[01:43:57.054 --> 01:44:01.296]  Do you know about the RAF documents they just released where they were bombing Saddam trying to get him to attack?
[01:44:01.876 --> 01:44:02.156]  No, sir.
[01:44:02.416 --> 01:44:05.538]  Do you know about April Gillespie telling Saddam to go ahead and invade Kuwait?
[01:44:06.019 --> 01:44:06.339]  No, sir.
[01:44:06.999 --> 01:44:08.080]  Well, we've got video of that.
[01:44:08.100 --> 01:44:09.241]  It's been all over national news.
[01:44:09.261 --> 01:44:09.461]  Okay.
[01:44:09.741 --> 01:44:10.621]  Alright.
[01:44:10.641 --> 01:44:12.903]  Do you know about... Look, I'm not trying to be mean to you, sir.
[01:44:12.943 --> 01:44:14.043]  This is life and death.
[01:44:14.364 --> 01:44:25.130]  Okay, do you know that Bill Clinton certified blood is wholesome for eight years as non-prison blood, and they didn't even test it, and they knew it had HIV in it, and tens of thousands of people died?
[01:44:25.350 --> 01:44:27.652]  Now, that I wouldn't be surprised of, sir.
[01:44:27.692 --> 01:44:28.632]  You don't like Bill Clinton?
[01:44:28.872 --> 01:44:29.913]  I've never liked Bill Clinton.
[01:44:29.933 --> 01:44:32.275]  Bill Clinton's a surrogate member of the Bush family.
[01:44:32.875 --> 01:44:34.296]  I mean, I've never liked Bill Clinton.
[01:44:34.316 --> 01:44:38.038]  Did you know Terry Reed, CIA, was there watching the cocaine being unloaded?
[01:44:38.058 --> 01:44:38.458]  No, sir.
[01:44:38.478 --> 01:44:39.599]  That's never been challenged?
[01:44:39.679 --> 01:44:39.979]  No, sir.
[01:44:39.999 --> 01:44:40.800]  I know nothing of that.
[01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:44.022]  Well, it must feel real good to know nothing about it.
[01:44:45.988 --> 01:44:50.810]  I'm simply trying to tell you, sir, that I don't believe that George Bush had any prior knowledge to 9-11.
[01:44:50.870 --> 01:44:54.911]  Okay, well that's totally, I mean, not the public, that's now admitted that he had prior knowledge.
[01:44:54.931 --> 01:44:58.172]  There's no proof that he had prior knowledge.
[01:44:58.192 --> 01:45:05.214]  And you can say there's no proof that there's salmon in the Pacific Ocean or the Atlantic Ocean.
[01:45:05.314 --> 01:45:08.535]  He had no proof of the attack's prior knowledge, sir.
[01:45:08.556 --> 01:45:10.756]  He had no proof that he had prior knowledge.
[01:45:10.776 --> 01:45:11.657]  Say it five more times.
[01:45:13.278 --> 01:45:14.060]  He had no proof.
[01:45:14.943 --> 01:45:15.606]  You have no proof.
[01:45:15.626 --> 01:45:16.027]  Say it again.
[01:45:16.429 --> 01:45:17.934]  I said you have no proof.
[01:45:17.974 --> 01:45:19.018]  You have no proof, excuse me.
[01:45:19.662 --> 01:45:22.003]  You have no proof, sir, that he had prior knowledge.
[01:45:22.023 --> 01:45:24.744]  Because if he did, he would have done everything in his power to stop it.
[01:45:24.964 --> 01:45:25.984]  Hey, let me ask you a question.
[01:45:26.024 --> 01:45:29.165]  I don't think you're a government agent, but I bet you're a government employee.
[01:45:29.205 --> 01:45:30.366]  I'm just a private citizen, sir.
[01:45:30.386 --> 01:45:31.486]  But I bet you work for the government.
[01:45:31.726 --> 01:45:32.066]  No, sir.
[01:45:32.467 --> 01:45:33.687]  No, I'm just a private citizen.
[01:45:33.727 --> 01:45:34.887]  You have government contracts.
[01:45:35.308 --> 01:45:38.209]  No, I'm a person who simply loves his country, sir.
[01:45:39.149 --> 01:45:43.110]  So, criticizing a corrupt government is bad.
[01:45:43.451 --> 01:45:47.052]  Loving your country is mindlessly going, I don't know, but you have no proof.
[01:45:47.592 --> 01:45:50.776]  Well, if you want to make a believer out of me, show me the proof.
[01:45:51.276 --> 01:45:52.678]  And then maybe I'll believe you.
[01:45:52.718 --> 01:45:54.480]  He keeps saying, show you the money.
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:55.622]  I already showed you the money.
[01:45:55.682 --> 01:45:56.863]  You haven't shown me anything, sir.
[01:45:57.023 --> 01:45:58.225]  Have you seen any of my films?
[01:45:58.485 --> 01:45:59.086]  Yes, sir, I have.
[01:45:59.366 --> 01:46:00.027]  What film is that?
[01:46:00.708 --> 01:46:06.174]  I don't know what the names of them are, but I flip through the channels and I come across your program and I'll sit and I'll watch them.
[01:46:06.796 --> 01:46:10.161]  Well, I agree with some of the things that you say.
[01:46:10.181 --> 01:46:14.326]  I don't agree with all of them, and I certainly do not agree... Let me ask you a question, Chris.
[01:46:14.346 --> 01:46:20.614]  Do you believe that the CIA for client banks controls over 80% of the narcotics brought into this country?
[01:46:20.835 --> 01:46:21.135]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:21.195 --> 01:46:22.237]  I have no knowledge of that.
[01:46:22.952 --> 01:46:24.113]  Okay, I have no knowledge of that at all.
[01:46:24.133 --> 01:46:25.854]  You can either confirm or deny, huh?
[01:46:26.054 --> 01:46:26.194]  Okay.
[01:46:26.274 --> 01:46:43.583]  All I'm trying to say is, as I'm simply saying... Have you heard the LBJ tape released two years ago by the LBJ Presidential Museum and Library in Austin, Texas, what we already knew from the documents, where the Gulf of Tonkin never happened, and was used as a pretext with the 58 million Americans died in?
[01:46:43.863 --> 01:46:44.804]  No, sir, I have not heard that.
[01:46:45.044 --> 01:46:46.885]  Do you believe that, or do you think I'm just making that up?
[01:46:47.481 --> 01:46:48.341]  Well, I wouldn't know, sir.
[01:46:48.361 --> 01:46:49.262]  I don't know anything about it.
[01:46:49.302 --> 01:46:50.082]  I would need to study it.
[01:46:50.262 --> 01:46:52.643]  Yeah, but you could just say I have no proof!
[01:46:52.863 --> 01:46:55.944]  You could just say that I don't have a shred of evidence!
[01:46:56.104 --> 01:47:03.887]  The only thing I see you doing, sir, every week is bad-mouthing George Bush, telling everybody how he's a terrorist and a murderer, but you show us no proof!
[01:47:05.375 --> 01:47:10.499]  You kind of remind me of a person who claims to have been kidnapped by aliens.
[01:47:10.579 --> 01:47:13.802]  You tell a real fascinating story, sir, but you can't back it up.
[01:47:13.822 --> 01:47:15.303]  Okay, you can use all the buzzwords you want.
[01:47:15.343 --> 01:47:17.665]  Let's go over something right now you can't even debate.
[01:47:18.005 --> 01:47:18.545]  Probably not.
[01:47:18.966 --> 01:47:23.889]  Did George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld say that they knew Saddam had weapons of mass destruction?
[01:47:24.190 --> 01:47:24.470]  Yes, sir.
[01:47:25.285 --> 01:47:26.745]  And did it turn out that wasn't true?
[01:47:27.245 --> 01:47:28.166]  Well, we haven't found any.
[01:47:28.526 --> 01:47:29.886]  He probably got them shipped to Syria.
[01:47:29.906 --> 01:47:30.286]  No, no, no.
[01:47:30.666 --> 01:47:31.006]  Oh, no, no.
[01:47:31.046 --> 01:47:32.306]  They've officially said they were wrong.
[01:47:32.687 --> 01:47:35.767]  Now the CIA officers have gone public and said they were ordered to lie.
[01:47:36.007 --> 01:47:40.148]  We have the down... Was the Nigerian document for uranium fabricated?
[01:47:40.508 --> 01:47:41.108]  I don't know, sir.
[01:47:41.128 --> 01:47:41.969]  I don't know anything about that.
[01:47:42.009 --> 01:47:48.850]  Was the Pat Tillman case, where they claimed he was killed by Al-Qaeda, it turns out by his own troops, was that fabricated?
[01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:50.252]  I don't believe it was, sir.
[01:47:50.292 --> 01:47:52.916]  I found out about that just the other day and I was very upset about it.
[01:47:52.976 --> 01:47:54.779]  They now admit, sir, that they lied.
[01:47:55.561 --> 01:47:59.307]  Like I said, I was very upset about that because I was a great admirer... Are you saying the government didn't lie?
[01:47:59.888 --> 01:48:00.369]  I beg your pardon?
[01:48:00.629 --> 01:48:02.252]  Are you saying they did or didn't lie?
[01:48:02.805 --> 01:48:05.086]  Well, in the case of Pat Tillman, they did, sir, yes.
[01:48:05.166 --> 01:48:06.587]  Okay, what about Jessica Lynch?
[01:48:06.627 --> 01:48:18.233]  She cowered and feared as a Hispanic American, took out those Iraqis, but because they wanted to put women in frontline combat, they told those families to shut up, and they gave her credit for something she never did!
[01:48:18.373 --> 01:48:25.016]  Then they beat up the doctors that took care of her and our dad, and made a lie about it, and had Jerry Bruckheimer produce it!
[01:48:25.397 --> 01:48:26.457]  I haven't heard anything of that.
[01:48:26.517 --> 01:48:28.078]  BBC, baby!
[01:48:28.298 --> 01:48:30.079]  And they admit the whole thing was a lie!
[01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:30.900]  Okay.
[01:48:31.500 --> 01:48:34.842]  Now, as I stated before, sir... Hey, you want me to keep firing these at you for 10 hours as I can?
[01:48:35.062 --> 01:48:37.843]  Sir, you can... You don't know what you're... Hey, let me tell you something.
[01:48:37.863 --> 01:48:39.324]  You can fire them at me if you want to, sir.
[01:48:39.584 --> 01:48:40.184]  You want me to sit?
[01:48:40.204 --> 01:48:42.345]  I'm telling... Well, I'm sorry if I make you sick, sir.
[01:48:42.365 --> 01:48:46.267]  I'm simply a person who loves this country, and I want to stand up... I love my country, too.
[01:48:46.287 --> 01:48:47.708]  And I want to stand up for my president, sir.
[01:48:47.728 --> 01:48:50.089]  Did you hear us talking about genetic engineering in the last hour?
[01:48:50.249 --> 01:48:50.729]  Yes, sir, I did.
[01:48:50.929 --> 01:48:52.130]  You think that's a bunch of bull, too?
[01:48:52.930 --> 01:48:53.750]  I'd have to study it, sir.
[01:48:53.770 --> 01:48:54.151]  I don't know.
[01:48:54.391 --> 01:48:54.811]  That's right.
[01:48:54.831 --> 01:48:57.252]  He must feel really good to not know anything.
[01:48:57.859 --> 01:49:01.382]  Okay, sir, I don't... You just know that you religiously don't believe me.
[01:49:01.622 --> 01:49:03.023]  Sir, do you know what Skull and Bones is?
[01:49:03.043 --> 01:49:07.927]  Sir, I believe some of the things you say, but not all of the things that... Sir, do you know what the Fool Society is?
[01:49:07.947 --> 01:49:11.410]  No, sir, I don't know what the Fool Society is.
[01:49:11.450 --> 01:49:12.991]  Sir, do you know what Bohemian Grove is?
[01:49:13.826 --> 01:49:14.166]  No, sir.
[01:49:14.206 --> 01:49:15.267]  I don't know what bohemian grows.
[01:49:15.287 --> 01:49:18.530]  Well, you better find out because your life depends on it.
[01:49:18.870 --> 01:49:20.232]  I love you, Chris.
[01:49:20.692 --> 01:49:23.534]  Well, sir, I... I spend 18 hours a day working.
[01:49:24.015 --> 01:49:25.136]  I'm working so hard.
[01:49:25.256 --> 01:49:26.557]  I know what I'm talking about.
[01:49:26.577 --> 01:49:31.441]  Alex, I haven't... And you can sit there and shoot your mouth off and say I don't, but you're dead wrong, brother.
[01:49:31.461 --> 01:49:33.663]  Now, to me, sir, like, you're the only one shooting his mouth off.
[01:49:33.783 --> 01:49:37.286]  No, I'm giving you nothing but facts, and I can keep doing it for 10 hours.
[01:49:37.526 --> 01:49:39.388]  Now, you know, let me ask you again.
[01:49:39.408 --> 01:49:40.349]  No, no, no, no.
[01:49:40.869 --> 01:49:41.229]  Alright.
[01:49:41.610 --> 01:49:42.750]  And I said 58 million.
[01:49:42.891 --> 01:49:44.391]  I was going so fast.
[01:49:44.412 --> 01:49:44.872]  58,000 Americans.
[01:49:45.392 --> 01:49:46.373]  So see, I corrected myself.
[01:49:47.474 --> 01:49:48.634]  We'll be right back with more news.
[01:49:48.674 --> 01:49:49.095]  Your call.
[01:49:49.115 --> 01:49:49.495]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.914 --> 01:49:55.456]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.616 --> 01:49:58.719]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.839 --> 01:50:02.743]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.803 --> 01:50:07.008]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.368 --> 01:50:11.152]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.232 --> 01:50:13.094]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.294 --> 01:50:16.576]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.636 --> 01:50:21.358]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.498 --> 01:50:24.540]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:27.581]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.062 --> 01:50:34.185]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.725 --> 01:50:38.507]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:38.907 --> 01:50:40.287]  Order your video today.
[01:50:40.687 --> 01:50:41.668]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[01:50:41.728 --> 01:50:43.708]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.
[01:50:43.728 --> 01:50:45.269]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:50:53.439 --> 01:50:58.661]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:58.801 --> 01:51:06.904]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:07.144 --> 01:51:14.186]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:14.386 --> 01:51:15.667]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[01:51:15.747 --> 01:51:21.651]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.831 --> 01:51:26.935]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.035 --> 01:51:35.921]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.181 --> 01:51:39.484]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:41.565 --> 01:51:45.588]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:46.429 --> 01:51:47.990]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:51:48.230 --> 01:51:48.570]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:53.823 --> 01:51:59.326]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:51:59.486 --> 01:52:00.547]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:52:00.667 --> 01:52:01.548]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:52:01.648 --> 01:52:04.489]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:52:04.689 --> 01:52:09.572]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:52:09.812 --> 01:52:10.893]  Check out this new product.
[01:52:11.053 --> 01:52:12.174]  It's called No B.O.
[01:52:12.254 --> 01:52:13.955]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:52:14.315 --> 01:52:16.396]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[01:52:16.436 --> 01:52:17.997]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:52:18.217 --> 01:52:20.839]  Look, the creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.
[01:52:20.919 --> 01:52:25.742]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[01:52:26.022 --> 01:52:29.144]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[01:52:29.284 --> 01:52:34.688]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:52:34.768 --> 01:52:35.549]  Try No-BO.
[01:52:35.649 --> 01:52:36.629]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:52:37.810 --> 01:52:40.691]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[01:52:40.892 --> 01:52:43.053]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B-O.
[01:52:43.073 --> 01:52:46.414]  Check out their website at No-B-O.com.
[01:52:46.574 --> 01:52:49.876]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-B-O.
[01:52:50.056 --> 01:52:50.777]  That's No-B-O.com.
[01:52:50.977 --> 01:53:07.525]  Alright, Russell and David, David and Leslie and others, your calls are coming up.
[01:53:08.380 --> 01:53:14.705]  And I will get into more of this news, but the callers are bringing up every angle you can imagine, taking us in directions we'd never go in.
[01:53:14.725 --> 01:53:15.506]  It's always interesting.
[01:53:16.186 --> 01:53:32.439]  Before I go back to the calls, just briefly, both showings for tonight's broadcast of projection, I should say, of my new film, Martial Law, are sold out, and next Wednesday's showing is sold out.
[01:53:34.216 --> 01:53:41.583]  So we're now going to be showing another special screening of Martial Law and I'll be there as well and give a speech and have a question and answer.
[01:53:42.603 --> 01:53:46.767]  Next Thursday, not next Thursday, Thursday after next, June 16th.
[01:53:47.648 --> 01:53:50.670]  June 16th due to popular demand at 7.30 p.m.
[01:53:51.091 --> 01:53:53.573]  Alamo Draft House, South Lamar and their big theater.
[01:53:54.594 --> 01:53:59.898]  So I suggest that you go to InfoWars.com, link through and get your tickets to go to that now.
[01:54:01.139 --> 01:54:01.620]  So again,
[01:54:02.995 --> 01:54:10.803]  We're going to have another showing, because all three of these are sold out, coming up on June 16th, Thursday, June 16th at 7.30.
[01:54:12.205 --> 01:54:13.466]  Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[01:54:14.848 --> 01:54:19.533]  And if you want to get a hard copy of Martial Law, my new film,

[01:54:24.711 --> 01:54:26.491]  Covers 9-11, Who the Globalist Are.
[01:54:27.051 --> 01:54:28.432]  The latest police state developments.
[01:54:28.492 --> 01:54:29.893]  It's my most powerful film yet.

[01:54:43.738 --> 01:54:44.418]  They can tell you about them.
[01:54:44.438 --> 01:54:44.498]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:50.689 --> 01:54:53.290]  That's 888-253-3139.

[01:55:12.054 --> 01:55:13.734]  We had three weekly reports this week.
[01:55:14.054 --> 01:55:16.995]  Normally one, a lot of times two, but this time three.
[01:55:18.378 --> 01:55:22.382]  All of my films, a bunch of other films, my book, Paul Watson's book, I mean an e-book is usually $5.95.

[01:55:33.931 --> 01:55:38.635]  PrisonPlanet.tv or 888-253-3139.
[01:55:39.395 --> 01:55:41.017]  Russell in Florida, welcome Russell!
[01:55:41.777 --> 01:55:44.860]  Alex, Chris has me convinced, I think we're all a bunch of looney tunes.
[01:55:45.450 --> 01:55:47.071]  We really are a bunch of loonies, Jim.
[01:55:48.312 --> 01:55:53.796]  You know, I listened to that briefly yesterday, and I tried to call in, but the phone lines were jammed.
[01:55:54.796 --> 01:56:02.601]  That guy, I thought he was just in deep denial, or just in absolute worship of Bush, because that's what it seemed.
[01:56:02.621 --> 01:56:14.089]  But now, listening to it again, he has to be a professional agitator or something, because you were giving him mountains of evidence, and he didn't once say, wow, hmm,
[01:56:14.676 --> 01:56:16.157]  That sounds like something right there.
[01:56:16.197 --> 01:56:17.317]  Let's talk about that more.
[01:56:17.357 --> 01:56:20.399]  He just continued to deny, deny, deny.
[01:56:20.999 --> 01:56:24.741]  And you presented, he said you'd be laughed out of a grand jury.
[01:56:25.101 --> 01:56:31.024]  You presented enough evidence to a federal grand jury where they would have to take that case up.
[01:56:32.668 --> 01:56:42.992]  Sir, in federal and state grand juries, at least five times I know of, in lawsuits against the Bush administration for complicity, they declare national security and order the judge to throw it out.
[01:56:43.012 --> 01:56:43.212]  Of course.
[01:56:43.472 --> 01:56:43.852]  Of course.
[01:56:44.032 --> 01:56:52.255]  Well, we know that, but I'm saying in a perfect world, we both know, if everything was the way it was supposed to be, that there's an orgy of evidence.
[01:56:52.595 --> 01:56:55.076]  But I mean, this stuff has been going to court!
[01:56:56.076 --> 01:56:56.317]  I know.
[01:56:57.117 --> 01:56:59.017]  But you never hear about it on the major media.
[01:56:59.418 --> 01:57:00.418]  You never hear a thing about it.
[01:57:02.483 --> 01:57:02.903]  I don't know.
[01:57:02.963 --> 01:57:09.888]  I don't want to disagree with you, just for disagreement's sake, but I really think the guy was just completely ignorant.
[01:57:11.049 --> 01:57:22.417]  Well, he would have to be incredibly ignorant, and the point that I was trying to say is, you know, he didn't once say, when you brought up these facts, Alex, you may be on to something, let's investigate this further.
[01:57:22.457 --> 01:57:23.537]  He just continued to deny.
[01:57:23.618 --> 01:57:29.442]  So he was a person that just, I think he worships this government, and he probably worships Bush like a god.
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:32.280]  I hear you.
[01:57:32.300 --> 01:57:33.281]  Anything else, Russell?
[01:57:34.041 --> 01:57:34.502]  Um, no.
[01:57:34.582 --> 01:57:35.542]  Just keep up the good work.
[01:57:35.562 --> 01:57:36.223]  You're a warrior.
[01:57:36.323 --> 01:57:39.785]  And, uh, I would have probably cut this guy off a while before that.
[01:57:40.085 --> 01:57:40.845]  Alright, thanks for the call.
[01:57:40.865 --> 01:57:41.866]  We'll be back in the third hour.
[01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:50.471]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.111 --> 01:57:52.072]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:52.859 --> 01:57:53.960]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.620 --> 01:57:55.440]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:57:57.061]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.081 --> 01:58:01.623]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.943 --> 01:58:06.064]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.084 --> 01:58:12.447]  All right, we're into the third hour of this Friday, June 3rd, 2005 edition.
[01:58:12.507 --> 01:58:14.868]  Masses of news coming up on our channel, Covered in Detail.
[01:58:16.388 --> 01:58:19.790]  But I've done a pretty good job about taking calls today, but not as good as I'd like to.
[01:58:19.810 --> 01:58:21.891]  I am now giving each caller about a minute and a half.
[01:58:21.991 --> 01:58:23.472]  I'm moving fast through your calls.
[01:58:23.932 --> 01:58:26.293]  You hear a caller hang up, it's your chance to call in.
[01:58:26.313 --> 01:58:26.373]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:26.393 --> 01:58:27.554]  Here are the coordinates.
[01:58:27.574 --> 01:58:27.634]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:27.674 --> 01:58:28.254]  Uh, David in Arizona.
[01:58:28.314 --> 01:58:28.715]  Welcome, sir.
[01:58:28.735 --> 01:58:29.475]  Oh, good morning, Alex.
[01:58:29.515 --> 01:58:29.695]  Hello.
[01:58:41.471 --> 01:58:41.851]  Hello.
[01:58:42.211 --> 01:58:45.033]  Um, I wanted to tell you, I used to live in Austin.
[01:58:45.093 --> 01:58:51.576]  I used to live in Hyde Park on Avenue G. I used to fly out of Robert Mueller Airport, so I know the town very well.
[01:58:52.837 --> 01:58:53.297]  Okay.
[01:58:53.838 --> 01:58:56.319]  The issue that I wanted to bring up is the chemtrails.
[01:58:57.119 --> 01:59:10.867]  Um, I have read everything I can find on the chemtrails, and I wanted to hear your opinion on what you think they're doing, because every day I see these chemtrails crisscross like a tic-tac-toe all across the sky.
[01:59:11.758 --> 01:59:13.738]  What do you think they're doing with the chemtrail?
[01:59:15.659 --> 01:59:28.482]  Well, there's a bunch of different government programs, admitted programs, to aerosolize and manipulate the weather, to manipulate crops, all sorts of, thousands of biological, chemical, radiological tests on us.
[01:59:28.502 --> 01:59:29.262]  That's all admitted.
[01:59:29.582 --> 01:59:31.842]  And that was back, you know, from the 50s to the 70s.
[01:59:31.902 --> 01:59:34.143]  Now, everything they just keep it classified.
[01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:35.410]  We're good to go.
[01:59:58.980 --> 02:00:02.244]  Antennas that they claim are weather antennas, but experts have looked at them.
[02:00:02.284 --> 02:00:03.726]  They're identical to HAARP systems.
[02:00:03.766 --> 02:00:06.929]  They admit to manipulate the atmosphere and weather patterns.
[02:00:07.230 --> 02:00:14.879]  I mean, I'm sure you heard for the 50th year of, or 60th year of, you know, the defeat of Hitler or whatever in Russia, they cleared the skies for the event.
[02:00:15.419 --> 02:00:18.503]  That was just limited cloud seeding with the Russian Air Force.
[02:00:20.401 --> 02:00:37.768]  They use it to ionize the atmosphere, but they've got to have this barium salt or this aluminum there to be able to do this resonance, because you've got HAARP above it, up in the higher atmosphere, and then you've got these antennas energizing it from below.
[02:00:37.788 --> 02:00:44.430]  And so that's one thing they're doing, and there's a bunch of different programs.
[02:00:44.450 --> 02:00:46.111]  The problem is, kooks and idiots,
[02:00:46.764 --> 02:00:49.265]  We'll point at any condensation trail and go, Look!
[02:00:49.325 --> 02:00:50.385]  Chemtrails!
[02:00:50.885 --> 02:00:53.206]  But it's gone in two minutes.
[02:00:53.266 --> 02:00:53.426]  No.
[02:00:53.846 --> 02:00:58.428]  A chemtrail is something on a hot, sunny day at 4,000 feet that's there for five hours.
[02:00:59.328 --> 02:01:00.008]  And expands.
[02:01:00.108 --> 02:01:02.289]  And I never saw that until seven years ago.
[02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:04.289]  And it gets worse and worse every year.
[02:01:04.609 --> 02:01:06.990]  And a jet will be right next to it, not leaving a trail.
[02:01:07.330 --> 02:01:12.132]  And some unmarked military plane will be leaving some gigantic, just huge trails.
[02:01:13.012 --> 02:01:14.752]  I mean, literally, it'll be there five hours later.
[02:01:14.872 --> 02:01:16.393]  It is massive, what's going on.
[02:01:16.946 --> 02:01:18.166]  Yes sir, it is.
[02:01:19.947 --> 02:01:30.231]  My feeling is that they're trying to poison our bodies with heavy metals so that when they decide to release biological weapons, our bodies will not be able to resist it.
[02:01:30.311 --> 02:01:32.491]  Now, I've read some information on this on the internet.
[02:01:33.092 --> 02:01:40.574]  I'm familiar with Jeff Brents and the work that he's done on studying the chemtrail problem.
[02:01:41.414 --> 02:01:45.536]  And my feeling is that it has to do with biological
[02:01:46.529 --> 02:01:49.812]  Uh, immunity, so that we will not be able to resist.
[02:01:49.992 --> 02:01:52.474]  Well, sir, what I'm telling you is... The globalists want to kill us.
[02:01:52.514 --> 02:01:54.796]  The globalists want to kill off all the people they can.
[02:01:54.836 --> 02:02:00.281]  They're trying to, uh, put heavy metals in our lungs so that we will... David?
[02:02:00.301 --> 02:02:00.461]  David?
[02:02:01.001 --> 02:02:03.203]  Again, we know those programs exist.
[02:02:03.663 --> 02:02:05.605]  I'm saying there's multiple programs.
[02:02:07.086 --> 02:02:07.447]  Mm-hmm.
[02:02:08.527 --> 02:02:09.889]  Clearly, there's multiple programs.
[02:02:09.929 --> 02:02:10.549]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:10.949 --> 02:02:12.531]  And see, I said I'd spend a minute with each caller.
[02:02:12.551 --> 02:02:14.332]  I just spent five minutes, but it was a great call.
[02:02:14.392 --> 02:02:15.213]  Thank you, David.
[02:02:16.503 --> 02:02:21.207]  No, look, we're going to do some shows on chemtrails.
[02:02:21.227 --> 02:02:25.771]  This is a very important issue, and I've done probably 30 shows over the years, but that's not enough.
[02:02:26.832 --> 02:02:36.101]  And it is a very serious, extremely serious issue, and it needs to be dealt with.
[02:02:37.002 --> 02:02:38.463]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:02:38.483 --> 02:02:38.904]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.362 --> 02:02:49.705]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.886 --> 02:02:54.289]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.449 --> 02:02:58.833]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.873 --> 02:03:00.234]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.034 --> 02:03:01.735]  Hammered!
[02:03:01.995 --> 02:03:06.240]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:05:49.896 --> 02:05:50.556]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.217 --> 02:05:52.177]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.976 --> 02:05:54.076]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.716 --> 02:05:55.557]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.317 --> 02:05:57.177]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.877 --> 02:06:01.478]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.058 --> 02:06:06.179]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.940 --> 02:06:13.021]  We're rocketing through your calls on Open Live Friday.
[02:06:13.061 --> 02:06:16.962]  Every imaginable issue being brought up, almost all of them, very important.
[02:06:18.562 --> 02:06:20.483]  Let's talk to David in Texas up next.
[02:06:20.543 --> 02:06:21.643]  Go ahead, David, welcome.
[02:06:22.569 --> 02:06:23.589]  Hi, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:24.330]  Pretty good, sir.
[02:06:25.090 --> 02:06:31.432]  I actually wanted to just bring something up to you, what I think would be a big step and like a solution towards all of this.
[02:06:32.193 --> 02:06:35.354]  And I mean, I've heard it mentioned before on the show and everything like that.
[02:06:35.954 --> 02:06:38.635]  But, and I'm not joking at all when I say this.
[02:06:40.315 --> 02:06:42.296]  What's the deal with Alex Jones for president?
[02:06:44.777 --> 02:06:45.637]  Oh, man, please.
[02:06:46.918 --> 02:06:49.139]  That'll never happen.
[02:06:49.679 --> 02:06:49.959]  Really?
[02:06:50.589 --> 02:06:52.911]  Number one, sir, I'm not old enough to run for president.
[02:06:52.931 --> 02:06:53.411]  Did you know that?
[02:06:54.112 --> 02:06:54.412]  Really?
[02:06:54.672 --> 02:06:56.173]  You have to be 35 years old.
[02:06:56.894 --> 02:07:00.436]  So when you get there, you're not going to go for it?
[02:07:00.556 --> 02:07:02.177]  No, I'm never going to run for president.
[02:07:02.198 --> 02:07:04.239]  A lot of people do it as a stunt.
[02:07:05.040 --> 02:07:06.501]  There's so many people who aren't serious.
[02:07:06.521 --> 02:07:07.982]  They just do it to be egomaniacs.
[02:07:08.782 --> 02:07:11.304]  And sir, I want to be completely serious with you.
[02:07:12.425 --> 02:07:14.466]  That process is totally controlled.
[02:07:15.747 --> 02:07:17.829]  And believe me, I don't want to be your leader.
[02:07:18.706 --> 02:07:20.526]  This is not about the ego of Alex Jones.
[02:07:20.546 --> 02:07:28.808]  I mean, I'll talk about the success we're having, which is good news to the troops, and people get mad at that saying it's ego when I talk about the success we're having.
[02:07:28.848 --> 02:07:31.529]  No, but it's not about Alex Jones.
[02:07:31.589 --> 02:07:34.349]  How about down the road?
[02:07:34.389 --> 02:07:37.610]  How about David for Secretary of State?
[02:07:37.670 --> 02:07:37.910]  Okay?
[02:07:37.970 --> 02:07:39.771]  I mean, it's not about me, sir.
[02:07:39.791 --> 02:07:41.531]  It's about the information.
[02:07:41.571 --> 02:07:42.791]  It's about fighting the globalists.
[02:07:43.471 --> 02:07:44.052]  But is it really?
[02:07:44.072 --> 02:07:46.012]  I mean, it has nothing to do with as far as
[02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:49.174]  Who's in office and who's making the calls and everything like that, huh?
[02:07:50.216 --> 02:08:00.793]  Well, so much, you know, we have like 60% turnout or 58% turnout to be exact for the last presidential election, but then we get 5-10% turnout in local elections where we can still have an effect.
[02:08:01.474 --> 02:08:06.838]  The federal government's supposed to be very small and coin the money, protect the borders, and defend the nation.
[02:08:07.378 --> 02:08:07.879]  That's it.
[02:08:07.999 --> 02:08:10.480]  Instead, they're busy running our lives.
[02:08:10.661 --> 02:08:17.826]  So we need to take over the local government so they can't... I mean, look, Bush passes a new freedom to forcibly, psychologically test and forcibly drug.
[02:08:18.246 --> 02:08:20.468]  We're beating it all over the country at the state level.
[02:08:21.188 --> 02:08:23.390]  You see, I mean, that's the kind of stuff we gotta do.
[02:08:23.410 --> 02:08:24.350]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:08:25.171 --> 02:08:26.612]  And I appreciate your kind words, but...
[02:08:27.539 --> 02:08:29.660]  Seriously, I'll never run for president.
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:31.540]  Leslie in Virginia.
[02:08:31.560 --> 02:08:32.381]  Leslie, go ahead.
[02:08:32.781 --> 02:08:34.161]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:08:34.221 --> 02:08:38.723]  I was just listening to the Chris clip, and I found it interesting.
[02:08:39.043 --> 02:08:43.264]  First of all, I want to congratulate you because you've got these globalist minions coming out of the woodwork.
[02:08:43.884 --> 02:08:49.746]  It was very clear his objection, he lacked any objectivity.
[02:08:50.086 --> 02:08:55.728]  His objection was for one thing, and that was to discredit you at all costs.
[02:08:56.061 --> 02:08:57.584]  He went to Space Aliens.
[02:08:57.624 --> 02:09:00.529]  He said he reviewed your films through the channels.
[02:09:00.589 --> 02:09:02.071]  He didn't understand.
[02:09:02.732 --> 02:09:04.055]  You had to convince him.
[02:09:04.355 --> 02:09:05.918]  They were all the buzzwords.
[02:09:06.559 --> 02:09:10.065]  I was surprised that you did not ask him what he did for a living.
[02:09:10.717 --> 02:09:12.979]  Well, I did imply that he was a bootlicker.
[02:09:13.279 --> 02:09:15.441]  I know, but you didn't go after him.
[02:09:15.461 --> 02:09:18.524]  I mean, you went after the fact, and I applaud you for that.
[02:09:19.225 --> 02:09:20.466]  And he had no response.
[02:09:20.826 --> 02:09:22.388]  Each time, no response.
[02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:25.871]  Y'all see, I'm not really concerned about personal attacks.
[02:09:27.642 --> 02:09:29.804]  I really just wanted to try to wake the guy up.
[02:09:30.124 --> 02:09:30.404]  I know.
[02:09:30.664 --> 02:09:33.366]  But see Alex, the guy had an agenda.
[02:09:33.907 --> 02:09:35.288]  And it was very clear.
[02:09:35.308 --> 02:09:40.592]  It would be nice if he would call back and let your listeners know more about him.
[02:09:44.214 --> 02:09:45.435]  You know what I think?
[02:09:45.515 --> 02:09:52.477]  I think he's a good guy who thinks the rest of the world lives inside his brain, and what he thinks is the way everybody else thinks.
[02:09:52.517 --> 02:09:54.678]  I think he's a very naive baby.
[02:09:55.098 --> 02:09:56.858]  No, I didn't find him naive.
[02:09:56.998 --> 02:09:58.399]  I found him very manipulative.
[02:09:58.539 --> 02:10:00.079]  That is my take on Chris.
[02:10:00.099 --> 02:10:00.980]  Very manipulative.
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:03.581]  Well, I mean, I thought it was a ham-fisted attempt at that.
[02:10:03.641 --> 02:10:11.203]  I know, you know, it's a low-level guy, but the whole point being is I did not find any objectivity on his behalf.
[02:10:11.798 --> 02:10:15.019]  And, uh, you have a hard opinion of Chris Deniger.
[02:10:15.479 --> 02:10:17.079]  Well, thanks for the call, Leslie.
[02:10:17.119 --> 02:10:17.940]  I appreciate that.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.560]  Look, you've got people who are jaded, who don't care.
[02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:22.341]  They go, yeah, it's all corrupt, so what?
[02:10:23.121 --> 02:10:24.061]  They're the biggest problem.
[02:10:24.801 --> 02:10:26.282]  Then you've got well-meaning people.
[02:10:26.302 --> 02:10:29.902]  I keep calling him Mike, but it was Chris.
[02:10:34.224 --> 02:10:38.445]  I mean, I think he's well-meaning, just a useful idiot who cannot believe this.
[02:10:38.485 --> 02:10:41.626]  It's just he would rock his world just too much.
[02:10:41.666 --> 02:10:43.507]  He just can't deal with it.
[02:10:44.327 --> 02:10:45.767]  You know, he's a dudley do-right.
[02:10:45.828 --> 02:10:46.488]  He's foolish.
[02:10:47.048 --> 02:10:49.909]  He's very ignorant.
[02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:53.870]  And very, oh, what's the proper term?
[02:10:53.950 --> 02:10:54.390]  Innocent.
[02:10:55.330 --> 02:10:57.411]  Okay, he hasn't been around the block, you could say.
[02:10:59.210 --> 02:11:10.952]  And at the same time, there are globalists who are just plainly evil and love power and control and love domination and know what's going on and people that know that the globalists are evil and decide to join it consciously.
[02:11:10.992 --> 02:11:11.992]  Those are very evil people.
[02:11:12.852 --> 02:11:18.934]  And then you've got those of us that fight it, that hate tyranny, that love liberty, that see threats when they're coming down the road and stand up against it.
[02:11:20.314 --> 02:11:25.075]  And I think a lot of it is just our upbringing and also genetics and just who we are and what we are.
[02:11:25.095 --> 02:11:27.035]  You know, the type of people that never liked bullies
[02:11:28.058 --> 02:11:30.159]  The type of people that like busting up bullies.
[02:11:30.179 --> 02:11:33.520]  You know, that's the type of individuals that patriots are.
[02:11:34.600 --> 02:11:38.461]  We don't like punks and thugs and people that want to shove others around.
[02:11:39.062 --> 02:11:42.023]  We like to put them in their place.
[02:11:42.743 --> 02:11:45.424]  So, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:11:45.544 --> 02:11:46.524]  Mary Jane!
[02:11:46.544 --> 02:11:48.064]  Mary Jane, where are you calling me from?
[02:11:48.445 --> 02:11:50.525]  I'm calling from Michigan, the Upper Peninsula.
[02:11:50.705 --> 02:11:51.085]  Welcome!
[02:11:51.606 --> 02:11:53.566]  Hi, and you were talking about chemtrails a while ago.
[02:11:53.586 --> 02:11:55.807]  Well, we have them up here too for several years.
[02:11:56.570 --> 02:12:00.512]  And I called the Sheriff's Office once and they just said it's a military maneuver.
[02:12:01.452 --> 02:12:02.092]  But what is it?
[02:12:02.172 --> 02:12:02.873]  I don't know.
[02:12:03.433 --> 02:12:07.434]  Yeah, I mean, before condensation ice crystals only lasted a few minutes.
[02:12:08.015 --> 02:12:09.375]  And now they're there for five hours.
[02:12:09.715 --> 02:12:10.116]  I don't know.
[02:12:10.536 --> 02:12:11.536]  And then they're there all day.
[02:12:11.576 --> 02:12:13.617]  They spread out and cover the whole sky.
[02:12:14.497 --> 02:12:20.380]  But what I'm really calling about is this retinal scanning that's supposed to come in for ID.
[02:12:20.960 --> 02:12:23.441]  Yeah, retinal scan, thumb scans, chips.
[02:12:24.205 --> 02:12:27.512]  Uh, in the ID cards, uh, for all citizens but not illegal aliens.
[02:12:37.296 --> 02:12:41.720]  I sent it in to some company that will analyze it, and I'm afraid that that's a retinal scan.
[02:12:41.740 --> 02:12:43.441]  Oh, of course it is!
[02:12:43.461 --> 02:12:54.991]  They've got the masons go around to help the children get them digitally thumbprinted and retina scanned, and health clubs, tanning salons, grocery stores, they're all putting in thumb scanners.
[02:12:55.011 --> 02:12:56.913]  I mean, how long have I been screaming about that?
[02:12:56.933 --> 02:12:59.135]  It's sponsored by the Lions Club.
[02:12:59.535 --> 02:13:00.216]  See, there you go.
[02:13:00.416 --> 02:13:01.577]  They're putting it on at a church.
[02:13:02.157 --> 02:13:03.797]  I've been calling everybody.
[02:13:04.137 --> 02:13:06.318]  Maybe we can get our microchips at the church.
[02:13:06.898 --> 02:13:07.278]  Yeah.
[02:13:07.298 --> 02:13:10.039]  And have a little idol of the world leader in there and worship him.
[02:13:10.399 --> 02:13:12.419]  But the first person I called said, you need help.
[02:13:14.720 --> 02:13:22.482]  I said, well, I'm very informed and all the information I'm giving them is documented by this talk show host on Starway Radio.
[02:13:23.242 --> 02:13:24.282]  And I gave one your name.
[02:13:25.211 --> 02:13:27.953]  Well, all they have to have is an optometrist there to look at the eyes.
[02:13:27.993 --> 02:13:28.613]  What are they saying?
[02:13:28.633 --> 02:13:29.154]  That's what I said.
[02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:34.217]  Oh, we scan their eyes and send it off to a place, and then I said it was the Masons, and you said Lions Club.
[02:13:34.678 --> 02:13:40.722]  It's Lions Club, but I called some of the council members of the church, and some belong to them as well.
[02:13:40.742 --> 02:13:44.064]  Well, all over the place they have that retina scan, and it admits for a database.
[02:13:45.339 --> 02:13:48.840]  No, I just, uh, I said that this is documented information.
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:50.040]  It's just not well known.
[02:13:50.120 --> 02:13:53.180]  Well, thousands of school districts have thumb scanners to get lunches.
[02:13:53.200 --> 02:13:54.461]  No cash allowed.
[02:13:55.021 --> 02:13:55.941]  I mean, this is everywhere.
[02:13:55.961 --> 02:13:56.521]  Uh-huh.
[02:13:56.621 --> 02:13:59.641]  Now, don't laugh at it until it's put it in the grocery store.
[02:13:59.661 --> 02:14:01.282]  Then you'll go, well, I'm all for it then.
[02:14:01.302 --> 02:14:01.922]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:01.942 --> 02:14:02.462]  Yeah, thanks.
[02:14:02.862 --> 02:14:03.362]  Thank you.
[02:14:03.722 --> 02:14:06.043]  Let's talk to Mark in Missouri.
[02:14:06.103 --> 02:14:06.783]  Mark, go ahead.
[02:14:07.963 --> 02:14:08.503]  Hello, Alex.
[02:14:08.823 --> 02:14:09.383]  Hello, sir.
[02:14:09.423 --> 02:14:10.423]  How are you today?
[02:14:10.703 --> 02:14:10.923]  Good.
[02:14:11.503 --> 02:14:12.544]  Enjoy listening to you.
[02:14:13.004 --> 02:14:13.924]  Keep up the good work.
[02:14:14.324 --> 02:14:14.584]  Thank you.
[02:14:15.157 --> 02:14:18.218]  I'm coming down to see your showing on the 8th.
[02:14:19.698 --> 02:14:20.759]  Oh good, did you get tickets?
[02:14:21.219 --> 02:14:21.759]  I got tickets.
[02:14:22.099 --> 02:14:23.980]  Well that was smart, because it's sold out now.
[02:14:25.160 --> 02:14:27.501]  I got a couple of the last ones I guess.
[02:14:28.761 --> 02:14:33.442]  Just was wondering, will you have any of your videos and things there?
[02:14:33.462 --> 02:14:35.283]  I will have.
[02:14:36.155 --> 02:14:51.746]  All of my documentaries, a bunch of other titles we carry, t-shirts, everything at all three of these events, and now because the third event even sold out next Wednesday, we're going to have another event the next Thursday, June 16th, 7.30 p.m., Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[02:14:52.407 --> 02:14:55.689]  Will it be possible as far as I'm coming to speak to you at all?
[02:14:57.050 --> 02:15:02.434]  Well, yes sir, but if you try to speak to me when there's, you know, 250 people out there in the hallway, good luck.
[02:15:03.648 --> 02:15:05.690]  Because everybody will be like, I need to take you for coffee.
[02:15:05.710 --> 02:15:06.530]  Come eat with me right now.
[02:15:06.570 --> 02:15:07.591]  I've got to tell you about the New World Order.
[02:15:07.751 --> 02:15:08.452]  Here's a document.
[02:15:08.472 --> 02:15:10.813]  My brothers, you know, in the military gave me these photos.
[02:15:10.833 --> 02:15:13.695]  And I'll be looking at photos of troops in black masks in camps.
[02:15:13.735 --> 02:15:14.756]  And they took my children.
[02:15:14.776 --> 02:15:15.116]  Help me!
[02:15:15.137 --> 02:15:18.619]  You know, I mean, it's kind of, because the majority of the crowd isn't like that.
[02:15:18.659 --> 02:15:22.822]  But there'll be like 20 people that literally will start fighting with each other.
[02:15:23.422 --> 02:15:26.385]  And again, I'm just telling you what happens.
[02:15:26.445 --> 02:15:26.705]  And so,
[02:15:27.806 --> 02:15:35.835]  I mean, I'll be out there before the film and I'll take questions and answers and I'll be there a little bit after, but I mean, just good luck trying to talk to me.
[02:15:36.396 --> 02:15:36.736]  Okay.
[02:15:36.996 --> 02:15:37.817]  It's pretty ridiculous.
[02:15:37.837 --> 02:15:46.587]  I mean, I look like a, you know, like a, I don't want to think of the analogy, a T-bone steak with a bunch of, you know, hound dogs after me.
[02:15:46.907 --> 02:15:47.127]  Yeah.
[02:15:47.888 --> 02:15:49.450]  Well, mainly the
[02:15:50.066 --> 02:16:02.119]  The question is, you often talk about, and you just talked about on a couple calls ago, about getting more involved in the state and local government level fights and so forth.
[02:16:02.540 --> 02:16:07.485]  How does a person, how do we know how to get involved in that where we can be the most help?
[02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:14.274]  You'll probably have a county water board, and they're busy trying to grab the water, jack up prices, run scams.
[02:16:14.794 --> 02:16:24.261]  Most of them are a mafia system, and you've got a bunch of ignorant people on the board that don't even know, and the water board manager tells them what to do.
[02:16:24.281 --> 02:16:34.268]  So you learn, say, about water policy and the scams, you act all friendly, run for it, get elected, because nobody will probably even run for it, and then start raising cane.
[02:16:35.635 --> 02:16:36.796]  There's an example.
[02:16:36.896 --> 02:16:52.288]  You infiltrate the local NRA, show them all the NRA documents with their anti-gun, show them what they're arguing against the Second Amendment in court, and then you break off that group and take those members and start your own local Second Amendment group.
[02:16:52.368 --> 02:16:54.210]  You can start a land rights group.
[02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:55.531]  You can run for city council.
[02:16:55.831 --> 02:17:03.517]  Though I suggest getting into a... There's a lot of powerful boards and a lot of powerful committees that no one even runs for.
[02:17:04.708 --> 02:17:09.050]  Uh, or, or, you know, you'll be running against, uh, and frankly, this is a war.
[02:17:09.510 --> 02:17:13.832]  I'm not saying a lie to your constituents, saying, hey, you just want to bring better service and do what's right for the people.
[02:17:14.212 --> 02:17:15.753]  Leave it at that, or they'll really target you.
[02:17:15.973 --> 02:17:17.854]  They might even try to co-opt you and go, yes!
[02:17:17.874 --> 02:17:19.255]  I mean, this is like spy work.
[02:17:19.775 --> 02:17:21.556]  And then just get in and go, I'm a patriot!
[02:17:21.756 --> 02:17:22.436]  Ha ha!
[02:17:22.476 --> 02:17:23.197]  You're in trouble!
[02:17:24.097 --> 02:17:24.477]  Okay?
[02:17:24.817 --> 02:17:25.338]  Okay, thanks.
[02:17:25.938 --> 02:17:26.618]  Alright, thank you.
[02:17:27.038 --> 02:17:28.259]  Or if you're really strategic,
[02:17:29.247 --> 02:17:39.294]  Get on and just be somewhat patriotic and, you know, sabotage what you can when they're trying to hurt freedom and then start stacking the water board with your people.
[02:17:39.974 --> 02:17:40.655]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.865 --> 02:17:48.227]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:17:48.467 --> 02:17:52.310]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:17:52.630 --> 02:17:53.451]  Read the labels.
[02:17:53.871 --> 02:17:58.014]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:17:58.214 --> 02:18:02.417]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:18:02.797 --> 02:18:07.661]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:18:08.041 --> 02:18:11.623]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:18:11.803 --> 02:18:17.146]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[02:19:44.190 --> 02:19:48.091]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:19:48.311 --> 02:20:00.594]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:20:01.014 --> 02:20:01.414]  The U.S.
[02:20:01.454 --> 02:20:07.036]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:07.436 --> 02:20:09.657]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:20:11.517 --> 02:20:12.578]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:20:12.618 --> 02:20:15.459]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:20:15.559 --> 02:20:21.601]  However, shocking the economy with a reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:20:22.021 --> 02:20:25.382]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:20:25.462 --> 02:20:31.785]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[02:20:32.365 --> 02:20:36.368]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[02:20:36.488 --> 02:20:36.669]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:36.689 --> 02:20:36.909]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:44.312 --> 02:20:47.913]  How come every time you need to fill up your tank, you discover gas prices have gone up again?
[02:20:48.233 --> 02:20:50.713]  It's not only frustrating, but it's costing you big bucks at the pump.
[02:20:50.934 --> 02:20:51.674]  Is there hope in sight?
[02:20:51.834 --> 02:20:52.814]  Well, the solution is here.
[02:20:53.074 --> 02:20:54.634]  It's time for System 48 Plus.

[02:21:46.107 --> 02:21:48.868]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:21:48.888 --> 02:21:52.790]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:55.611 --> 02:21:58.872]  What I was describing earlier is what the globalists have done.
[02:21:58.912 --> 02:22:08.196]  About 110 years ago or so, the big robber barons, the railroad, would literally go get their sheriff put in, their city council put in over cities.
[02:22:09.842 --> 02:22:17.748]  They would run them covertly, stack the deck, and then really start raping the people, then get the taxes expanded and the taxes paid basically right into their coffers.
[02:22:18.468 --> 02:22:21.230]  Biggest business the bankers ever found was controlling government.
[02:22:23.712 --> 02:22:31.458]  And, uh, really, I mean, what we do is like force multiplication that the special forces engage in.
[02:22:31.478 --> 02:22:38.563]  You know, our special forces, they would just put them in behind enemy lines, they would train the indigenous people,
[02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:41.212]  Train them as spies.
[02:22:41.272 --> 02:22:42.473]  Train them as combatants.
[02:22:43.813 --> 02:22:44.754]  Motivate them.
[02:22:46.035 --> 02:22:49.857]  And that's all I do, is I try to educate you, get you to wake up.
[02:22:50.197 --> 02:22:51.458]  You help wake me up in many cases.
[02:22:51.498 --> 02:22:52.338]  I learn things from you.
[02:22:52.798 --> 02:22:53.759]  Get you involved.
[02:22:54.900 --> 02:23:00.383]  And whatever your skills are, I mean, just people in government leak stuff all the time.
[02:23:00.403 --> 02:23:01.603]  That really hurts the globalists.
[02:23:03.459 --> 02:23:07.762]  I think most people in government are probably on our side more than a lot of other citizens because they know what's going on.
[02:23:07.822 --> 02:23:10.023]  I mean, look folks, we're winning this thing.
[02:23:10.043 --> 02:23:11.284]  I mean, I've got to tell you the truth here.
[02:23:11.904 --> 02:23:13.365]  The enemy is in deep trouble.
[02:23:14.365 --> 02:23:24.151]  The parasites that want to use this country as their war machine, as their juggernaut, their people laughed at us ten years ago.
[02:23:24.171 --> 02:23:25.132]  They're not laughing anymore.
[02:23:25.152 --> 02:23:27.193]  Everything we said came true and they're paying attention.
[02:23:27.573 --> 02:23:29.174]  And they love their children too.
[02:23:29.994 --> 02:23:30.875]  So this isn't a game.
[02:23:32.631 --> 02:23:33.271]  Well, God bless you, Alex.
[02:24:01.058 --> 02:24:02.299]  You're sounding real good, buddy.
[02:24:02.319 --> 02:24:03.480]  Well, thank you, my friend.
[02:24:03.740 --> 02:24:10.365]  I'll tell you what, I want to give you an update on something you mentioned a while back, and I've heard you mention it time and time again.
[02:24:10.405 --> 02:24:11.866]  The Doom game.
[02:24:12.086 --> 02:24:14.587]  My son is playing it presently on the computer.
[02:24:15.288 --> 02:24:20.852]  Levels 31 and 32 actually have Nazi stuff in it, and he gets to kill them, so I said, ooh, I love it.
[02:24:22.031 --> 02:24:30.099]  But anyway, to make a long story short, I want to give you an update on the Car Show Swap Meet thing we had here.
[02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:30.780]  Yes.
[02:24:31.201 --> 02:24:37.807]  And out of about 65 tapes, I left the place with one.
[02:24:39.649 --> 02:24:41.011]  We gave all of them away.
[02:24:42.606 --> 02:24:53.957]  And, uh, my son, who's 13 now, was very institutional in, uh, helping them go, because he's seen every one of them, and he knows what the truth is, he knows what these pieces of garbage are up to, and, uh...
[02:24:56.912 --> 02:24:59.253]  He was very institutional in helping them move.
[02:24:59.814 --> 02:25:01.855]  What about your son that was in Iraq?
[02:25:01.875 --> 02:25:02.855]  Has he gotten back yet?
[02:25:02.875 --> 02:25:06.938]  No, but he did tell me that a friend of his did get his leg blown off and was discharged in Germany and he is furious.
[02:25:06.998 --> 02:25:08.719]  He said, I've got a year and a half left.
[02:25:23.177 --> 02:25:27.299]  And yes, he had to pay his own way back, the guy that was discharged, and he is furious.
[02:25:27.319 --> 02:25:33.482]  He said, I've got a year and a half left, and he's a good Christian, but he said four-letter word to government.
[02:25:36.423 --> 02:25:38.704]  And your son doesn't normally talk like that, does he?
[02:25:39.004 --> 02:25:39.765]  No, he doesn't.
[02:25:40.125 --> 02:25:41.666]  Like I said, he's a good Christian.
[02:25:41.706 --> 02:25:48.449]  His father-in-law is a preacher at a non-501c3 church, by the way, and you know what his father-in-law told me?
[02:25:48.469 --> 02:25:48.529]  Huh?
[02:25:49.537 --> 02:26:00.907]  After finding out what I was doing, handing out the videos and telling everybody, he said, and everybody needs to hear this, that you've either got God in your church or the government.
[02:26:01.948 --> 02:26:07.493]  If you're a 501c3 church, you will not have God in that church.
[02:26:08.792 --> 02:26:12.053]  Because there's no room for God, because you've allowed the government to come in.
[02:26:12.493 --> 02:26:15.254]  Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and to God what is God's.
[02:26:15.734 --> 02:26:19.775]  And believe me, the Bible's very strict on having state-run religion.
[02:26:20.255 --> 02:26:20.655]  Oh yeah!
[02:26:21.196 --> 02:26:21.576]  Oh yeah!
[02:26:22.136 --> 02:26:28.017]  But, uh, anyway, uh... But, uh, so, now for those who don't know, this is mainstream news.
[02:26:28.077 --> 02:26:29.578]  It's in a newspaper here, a newspaper there.
[02:26:31.104 --> 02:26:34.887]  If you die on the helicopter being flown out, you weren't killed in combat.
[02:26:34.987 --> 02:26:35.507]  There you go.
[02:26:35.807 --> 02:26:44.493]  If your leg is blown off, or both your arms and legs, or people who are quad amputees, I mean over folks, sometimes they even lose their eyes.
[02:26:44.513 --> 02:26:46.475]  I mean, they're just literal hell on earth.
[02:26:47.519 --> 02:26:56.488]  Uh, and they, they get them to Germany, they discharge them, and the families have to fly there, they put out, you know, things at the store to put dimes and nickels in.
[02:26:56.808 --> 02:27:00.751]  They have, the family has to get there, uh, put them on the plane, fly them back.
[02:27:01.252 --> 02:27:07.017]  When the troops die, they won't even dispatch, uh, the, uh, regular army to give them a proper burial.
[02:27:07.378 --> 02:27:09.419]  They have to get, uh, locals to come and do it.
[02:27:09.920 --> 02:27:10.861]  It's disgusting, sir.
[02:27:11.576 --> 02:27:12.237]  Yes, it is.
[02:27:12.617 --> 02:27:15.340]  Uh, Alex, if you'll hold me, I'd like to say something else.
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:19.624]  You gotta do it quick, Walt, because I got loaded phones here and I promise to spend a few minutes with each caller.
[02:27:19.644 --> 02:27:20.145]  Alright.
[02:27:20.906 --> 02:27:23.168]  So I'm gonna give you 45 seconds on the other side.
[02:27:23.188 --> 02:27:26.692]  I really gotta, I wanna take the rest of these calls and cover some news here.
[02:27:27.352 --> 02:27:30.255]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.
[02:27:30.856 --> 02:27:31.997]  Yeah, you support the troops.
[02:27:32.137 --> 02:27:34.760]  Take those stupid stickers off your cars and really support them!
[02:27:35.959 --> 02:27:38.961]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.862 --> 02:27:42.544]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.394 --> 02:27:53.299]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:27:53.819 --> 02:27:59.243]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now is the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:27:59.643 --> 02:28:09.690]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:28:09.810 --> 02:28:12.092]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:28:12.512 --> 02:28:15.794]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:28:15.854 --> 02:28:17.215]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:28:17.335 --> 02:28:24.820]  Nonex Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.

[02:30:31.299 --> 02:30:33.300]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:33.621 --> 02:30:36.563]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:30:58.701 --> 02:31:00.862]  Over two years ago, they invaded Iraq.
[02:31:01.182 --> 02:31:07.005]  They staged troops there six months before, so people have been in country and in the region for three years.
[02:31:08.046 --> 02:31:12.788]  They let them come home for maybe two weeks a year, and they rotate them right back into combat.
[02:31:12.808 --> 02:31:13.909]  Never been done before.
[02:31:13.949 --> 02:31:16.130]  Not in World War II, not in Vietnam.
[02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:17.550]  Only volunteers will do that.
[02:31:18.411 --> 02:31:21.372]  Not even the toughest men had trouble after two tours.
[02:31:22.073 --> 02:31:24.874]  This is some of the hardest fighting you can imagine, house to house.
[02:31:25.814 --> 02:31:33.679]  I mean, I wasn't in the military, I've had a lot of friends and family that were, and in the past, if they were going to raid something, I mean, it was one village a day.
[02:31:34.679 --> 02:31:36.600]  And that was very stressful, life and death.
[02:31:36.660 --> 02:31:41.623]  Imagine having to raid 50, 60 houses, two or three villages, and doing that five days a week.
[02:31:43.464 --> 02:31:52.630]  And imagine getting your arm blown off, your eyes blown out, your legs blown off, and then being told, alright, we're discharging you, get out, pay for your own ticket home,
[02:31:55.925 --> 02:31:57.246]  Alex, you don't support the TRIPS.
[02:31:57.266 --> 02:32:00.429]  Supporting the TRIPS means not caring about them and just worshiping government.
[02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:01.250]  Now, shut up!
[02:32:01.270 --> 02:32:02.871]  All right, Walt, finish up fast.
[02:32:02.891 --> 02:32:03.972]  Yeah, real quick.
[02:32:04.212 --> 02:32:13.039]  Uh, my son was one that, uh, was institutional in taking all that, uh, million of, uh, pieces of heavy military hardware over and burying it in Kuwait.
[02:32:13.179 --> 02:32:15.421]  And when it was time to re-up, I told him, no!
[02:32:16.142 --> 02:32:18.724]  No, I said, not only no, George, but hell no!
[02:32:19.364 --> 02:32:21.907]  I said, what do you think you took all that stuff over there for?
[02:32:23.027 --> 02:32:24.689]  I said, they didn't need a place to park it!
[02:32:25.245 --> 02:32:26.225]  That was in December of 2000.
[02:32:27.046 --> 02:32:28.806]  Remember that I told you about that?
[02:32:29.326 --> 02:32:29.486]  Yes.
[02:32:29.566 --> 02:32:34.868]  Also, I don't have one of these stupid stickers that says I support our troops on the back of my big diesel pickup.
[02:32:35.668 --> 02:32:42.870]  I've got it written in white shoe polish because I'm also involved in drag racing and that's how we have to put our times on our vehicles and so on.
[02:32:43.330 --> 02:32:47.391]  It says, God bless our troops because a little stupid sticker won't do.
[02:32:48.775 --> 02:32:56.441]  And I kept the yellow ribbons on there, even though George is home, because we have a whole bunch of guys yet that we need to get home.
[02:32:57.162 --> 02:32:58.323]  Alex, God bless you, buddy.
[02:32:58.343 --> 02:32:59.304]  Alright, thanks a lot.
[02:32:59.324 --> 02:33:00.004]  You're doing great work.
[02:33:00.264 --> 02:33:01.565]  Thanks a lot, I appreciate it.
[02:33:03.327 --> 02:33:08.631]  Well, again, I always flew an American flag outside my house, and I was the weirdo.
[02:33:09.592 --> 02:33:12.995]  You know, they have news articles, these people that have lots of American flags.
[02:33:13.175 --> 02:33:17.078]  Watch them, Bill Clinton's people, are saying, oh, they're so evil.
[02:33:18.087 --> 02:33:27.772]  And then 9-11 happened, and flying a flag then meant you worship the government, you worship the lies, you're going along with the propaganda, and that flag went down.
[02:33:29.713 --> 02:33:32.695]  And, uh, it's just that simple.
[02:33:33.696 --> 02:33:37.118]  And I told my wife, I said, no, we're not burning candles out there for the dead.
[02:33:37.798 --> 02:33:41.140]  Because those dead are going to be used for a fraud.
[02:33:41.960 --> 02:33:43.901]  And I said, it's all part of mass mind control.
[02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:45.002]  I am sad for the dead.
[02:33:45.746 --> 02:33:51.651]  But this is again mass brainwashing the national news saying go burn candles out front the house.
[02:33:52.392 --> 02:33:54.553]  She kind of got mad at me but a month later she got it.
[02:33:54.573 --> 02:33:55.334]  She's real smart.
[02:33:56.615 --> 02:34:00.058]  Because, see, I won't let them expropriate our sacred symbols.
[02:34:00.678 --> 02:34:01.639]  I love the American flag.
[02:34:01.659 --> 02:34:02.580]  I love what it symbolizes.
[02:34:03.240 --> 02:34:04.641]  But I don't worship the flag.
[02:34:04.862 --> 02:34:07.143]  It symbolizes my Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:34:07.644 --> 02:34:09.025]  My Declaration of Independence.
[02:34:10.626 --> 02:34:12.408]  And when they expropriate my flag,
[02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:16.903]  If you stick that on your car now, it means to people you're buying the fraud.
[02:34:18.143 --> 02:34:24.968]  Now until we take that flag back, and until the government starts calling it bad again, I'm not flying it.
[02:34:25.949 --> 02:34:27.930]  As soon as they say it's bad again, I'll put it up.
[02:34:28.331 --> 02:34:29.652]  That's when it means you're a patriot.
[02:34:31.153 --> 02:34:34.275]  I mean, I do fly a flag on Fourth of July and stuff, but that's different.
[02:34:34.575 --> 02:34:35.275]  Memorial Day.
[02:34:35.416 --> 02:34:41.620]  I do not fly it 24-7, you know, out there with dead bugs all over it like all these other people do.
[02:34:42.572 --> 02:34:43.913]  And it's really simple.
[02:34:45.354 --> 02:34:46.555]  It's really simple.
[02:34:49.537 --> 02:34:51.278]  I do not worship the American flag.
[02:34:51.298 --> 02:34:53.439]  You know, it's not some blood and soil cult here.
[02:34:55.181 --> 02:34:59.824]  Alright, let's go ahead and take a couple more calls here.
[02:34:59.844 --> 02:35:02.345]  And this will be it for calls, so I'm going to hit some news.
[02:35:02.746 --> 02:35:03.446]  Let's go quickly.
[02:35:04.026 --> 02:35:04.907]  Mike in Illinois.
[02:35:04.947 --> 02:35:05.427]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:35:05.647 --> 02:35:06.288]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[02:35:07.336 --> 02:35:08.617]  How are you doing?
[02:35:08.757 --> 02:35:09.117]  I'm good.
[02:35:09.157 --> 02:35:13.619]  Hey, listen, I want to ask you if you've ever heard of a book called Thieves in the Temple?
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:15.100]  Uh, yeah.
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:17.421]  That's a book written about the Federal Reserve.
[02:35:17.621 --> 02:35:18.502]  Yeah, it's a great book.
[02:35:18.522 --> 02:35:19.562]  I got it a couple weeks ago.
[02:35:19.582 --> 02:35:20.503]  I just finished reading it.
[02:35:20.543 --> 02:35:21.924]  We had Andre Eggleston on.
[02:35:22.224 --> 02:35:22.784]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:35:22.904 --> 02:35:26.266]  You know, you'll have to excuse my ignorance, because I've been traveling, Alex.
[02:35:26.426 --> 02:35:27.947]  I haven't been able to listen to you in the last three weeks.
[02:35:27.967 --> 02:35:29.007]  I wasn't saying you were ignorant.
[02:35:30.148 --> 02:35:31.709]  But, anyway, it's a fantastic book.
[02:35:31.769 --> 02:35:35.771]  And, Alex, I just want to ask you, after reading the book, and it's enlightened me in a lot of areas, too,
[02:35:36.671 --> 02:35:44.797]  I mean, wouldn't you say that the private bankers, the Bank of England, all this that started it, is really the massive part of the New World Order?
[02:35:44.837 --> 02:35:47.559]  I mean, when you really think about it, when people say, what is the New World Order?
[02:35:48.343 --> 02:36:01.334]  When you think about it, the Freemasons and all this entity of private bankers, and when you look at what's happening in our country of, you know, just these giant corporations, it's all corporate money that's running the country and printing money out of nothing.
[02:36:01.714 --> 02:36:08.020]  And wouldn't you say, Alex, in a nutshell, that that is pretty much the New World Order, aside from the dastardly things they do to people?
[02:36:09.221 --> 02:36:13.684]  You know, it's just a few thousand people, as you've always said before in your shows, that are really running this whole show.
[02:36:14.625 --> 02:36:23.269]  Well, it's a few hundred that give the orders, it's a few thousand that know the full picture, and it's a few million that enforce it, and you're absolutely right.
[02:36:23.309 --> 02:36:24.809]  Thanks for the call, Mike.
[02:36:24.929 --> 02:36:26.390]  Let me just briefly comment on this.
[02:36:29.091 --> 02:36:32.613]  The richest, most powerful person in the world is Queen Elizabeth.
[02:36:34.113 --> 02:36:42.997]  She owns two of the major TV production companies, that is one of her sons, her youngest son, that puts out all the hit pieces on their own family.
[02:36:44.620 --> 02:36:45.981]  It says they don't have any money.
[02:36:46.081 --> 02:36:47.142]  It says they're a joke.
[02:36:47.222 --> 02:36:48.283]  It says they're pathetic.
[02:36:50.464 --> 02:36:51.185]  It's ridiculous.
[02:36:52.426 --> 02:36:54.387]  They learned to go behind the scenes.
[02:36:54.447 --> 02:36:56.028]  To act like they're just figureheads.
[02:36:56.809 --> 02:36:59.110]  The Queen of England owns about 40% of Canada.
[02:36:59.130 --> 02:37:00.771]  She owns over half of Australia.
[02:37:00.791 --> 02:37:02.853]  She owns much of New Zealand.
[02:37:02.873 --> 02:37:06.916]  She owns large shares in De Beers with the Oppenheimers.
[02:37:07.890 --> 02:37:08.570]  With the diamonds.
[02:37:09.030 --> 02:37:13.051]  She owns a large portion of BP and other major oil companies.
[02:37:13.371 --> 02:37:16.392]  She didn't own Burger King until 2002.
[02:37:17.452 --> 02:37:21.853]  They sold it back to an American company, but then she owns a lot of stock in that front group.
[02:37:22.753 --> 02:37:24.633]  I mean, just thousands of companies.
[02:37:24.713 --> 02:37:25.374]  Her Bank.
[02:37:25.814 --> 02:37:27.274]  She owns a lot of the Bank of England.
[02:37:27.914 --> 02:37:30.275]  And then you've got her cousins, the Dutchroll family.
[02:37:30.295 --> 02:37:33.095]  They're all... It's admitted, they're all intermarried.
[02:37:34.215 --> 02:37:36.836]  They are a German family, the Sachs-Koburg-Gothas.
[02:37:39.105 --> 02:37:41.467]  And they started the Royal Israelite Movement.
[02:37:41.727 --> 02:37:46.030]  They say that they are the Aryans, that they are the true Jews, the Lost Tribe.
[02:37:46.050 --> 02:37:53.696]  And then, their ADL-controlled system then says when people in this country go join that, that they're evil and need to be arrested.
[02:37:53.736 --> 02:38:00.421]  But then, openly in her coronation, she's sworn in on supposedly the stone where Abraham almost sacrificed his son.
[02:38:00.461 --> 02:38:05.645]  And in the coronation, they declare her a Royal Israelite.
[02:38:06.066 --> 02:38:07.727]  I mean, this is some weird stuff, folks.
[02:38:08.693 --> 02:38:11.074]  And, uh, it's amazing.
[02:38:12.114 --> 02:38:19.215]  And it's the same story over and over and over and over and over again.
[02:38:20.496 --> 02:38:28.878]  And so you've got a bunch of Germanic royalty that is at the very top pinnacle.
[02:38:30.038 --> 02:38:33.159]  You know, Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands, founder of the Bilderberg Group, SS Colonel.
[02:38:36.893 --> 02:38:43.555]  The Duke, during World War II, was going to be king and had to advocate because he ran to Nazi Germany and barely got out and worshipped Hitler.
[02:38:43.835 --> 02:38:45.616]  There's all the film footage and all that of him.
[02:38:46.836 --> 02:38:47.696]  It's the same crew.
[02:38:47.776 --> 02:38:53.978]  Then, around them, they have a crew of Masons and Zionists that work for them.
[02:38:55.074 --> 02:38:56.355]  And that's meant to confuse people.
[02:38:56.415 --> 02:39:07.827]  So, as soon as you go, it's the Zionists, or they go, oh, that means the Jews, or as soon as you say it's this group or that group, they want you to do that, because then they can Balkanize groups, and then demonize anybody that talks about it.
[02:39:10.155 --> 02:39:13.799]  I mean, I've got Zionist documents that are public, published, and books they've written.
[02:39:13.879 --> 02:39:16.061]  Oh, we love it when they say things against Jews.
[02:39:16.081 --> 02:39:18.163]  Oh, we love it when they go after Jews.
[02:39:18.183 --> 02:39:24.349]  Because then all these, you know, these dumb Jews, that's what the Zionists call, you know, all these porch Jews.
[02:39:25.230 --> 02:39:26.752]  Horrible terms they have for them.
[02:39:28.293 --> 02:39:29.374]  Oh, they're so horrible.
[02:39:29.835 --> 02:39:31.617]  Yeah, then they come begging to us.
[02:39:32.975 --> 02:39:38.577]  And then, of course, they funded Hitler and had meetings with him, and one of his chief propagandists under Goebbels was Jewish.
[02:39:39.257 --> 02:39:40.418]  Goebbels was Jewish.
[02:39:41.158 --> 02:39:42.659]  Hitler was a quarter-Jewish.
[02:39:43.539 --> 02:39:45.460]  But, again, it isn't real Jews, folks.
[02:39:45.500 --> 02:39:50.141]  These are a... Really, they're what you'd call Arabs.
[02:39:50.841 --> 02:39:55.243]  A mix of Arabs and Central and Eastern Europeans.
[02:39:56.744 --> 02:39:57.704]  And they hate
[02:39:58.439 --> 02:39:59.940]  They absolutely hate Jews.
[02:40:00.460 --> 02:40:01.041]  Real Jews.
[02:40:01.081 --> 02:40:03.962]  They absolutely are sworn to destroy them.
[02:40:04.042 --> 02:40:07.044]  And they've got a dictatorship in Israel.
[02:40:08.465 --> 02:40:10.046]  And then all these fools!
[02:40:10.146 --> 02:40:12.147]  They think they're getting something over on the globalists.
[02:40:12.167 --> 02:40:13.708]  They think they're telling you the big secret.
[02:40:13.728 --> 02:40:18.891]  They think they've really done something when they go into these endless harangues against Jews.
[02:40:19.852 --> 02:40:25.836]  And these endless harangues... And you track back who controls the white supremacist groups?
[02:40:26.016 --> 02:40:26.476]  Government.
[02:40:27.270 --> 02:40:29.171]  You look at who controls the Mexican supremacist?
[02:40:29.391 --> 02:40:30.172]  The government.
[02:40:31.252 --> 02:40:34.654]  You heard Celica Stillo from all his internal intelligence.
[02:40:34.695 --> 02:40:35.195]  Yes, the U.S.
[02:40:35.255 --> 02:40:37.676]  is going to take over Mexico through the global system.
[02:40:37.977 --> 02:40:41.959]  And through the Lurican Quistas, they're filling Mexicans full of pride.
[02:40:41.999 --> 02:40:43.120]  They're taking over America.
[02:40:43.420 --> 02:40:45.021]  But really, they're going to enslave their own country.
[02:40:46.442 --> 02:40:47.862]  See, it's very sophisticated.
[02:40:49.443 --> 02:40:50.704]  Very, very serious.
[02:40:50.964 --> 02:40:53.246]  I mean, you've got to play chess and not checkers here.
[02:40:57.634 --> 02:41:00.616]  Look, the devil, the devil is real.
[02:41:00.956 --> 02:41:02.257]  This is how I ended the show yesterday.
[02:41:03.338 --> 02:41:04.378]  You know, the devil is real.
[02:41:04.478 --> 02:41:05.019]  Evil is real.
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:11.483]  And every prophet that came was there to rebuke evil people in control of Israel.
[02:41:12.383 --> 02:41:18.867]  Moses threw down the tablets, and you know, God destroyed those who were worshipping the golden calf.
[02:41:18.927 --> 02:41:20.088]  I mean, was he anti-semitic?
[02:41:21.509 --> 02:41:21.809]  No!
[02:41:22.049 --> 02:41:24.351]  The devil always targets the chosen people.
[02:41:25.299 --> 02:41:28.201]  And so he takes over their leaders, and he puts counterfeits in!
[02:41:29.001 --> 02:41:33.644]  And Christ came, and we're all now his chosen people, and he's waging war on Christians!
[02:41:33.924 --> 02:41:37.066]  They don't care if you're Buddhist, or Hindu, or Muslim, the globalist stuff.
[02:41:37.407 --> 02:41:38.387]  It's Christians!
[02:41:39.568 --> 02:41:44.231]  All these leftists, they don't care about other religions, but they will hiss over Christians!
[02:41:45.336 --> 02:41:49.259]  I don't mean the phony counterfeit neocon Christians, you know, that are being bought.
[02:41:49.759 --> 02:41:55.123]  But now the neocons are saying, worship Israel, always do what is in, quote, their interest, or you're going to hell.
[02:41:55.163 --> 02:41:55.683]  Well, wait a minute!
[02:41:57.084 --> 02:42:13.236]  You've got this group of atheistic Zionists, who are really Luciferian, running Israel, who supported Hitler, who hold the Jews as much captive as they do the Palestinians, who know exactly what they're doing, and shouldn't we speak out against them?
[02:42:14.241 --> 02:42:27.991]  I mean, if all the prophets came, if Christ came to speak out against the tiny minority that had enslaved God's people, who are working with Rome, I mean, it all makes perfect sense.
[02:42:29.072 --> 02:42:33.835]  So, do I stand with Moses, who threw the tablets down on that group of Jews?
[02:42:34.335 --> 02:42:34.976]  Absolutely!
[02:42:35.376 --> 02:42:36.297]  Are Jews bad?
[02:42:36.317 --> 02:42:37.858]  No, they're not!
[02:42:38.498 --> 02:42:40.580]  This is the people that God gave His covenant.
[02:42:41.480 --> 02:42:43.421]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:42:43.821 --> 02:42:47.022]  So they want to confuse that issue.
[02:42:47.902 --> 02:42:49.623]  They want us all fighting with each other.
[02:42:50.183 --> 02:42:52.484]  But I can deprogram a Laurie Conquista like that.
[02:42:52.584 --> 02:42:54.464]  I can deprogram a racist black like that.
[02:42:55.024 --> 02:42:56.905]  I can deprogram a lot of white supremacists.
[02:42:57.565 --> 02:43:02.607]  I explain how they're being manipulated, how it's part of a larger paradigm, and they understand.
[02:43:04.800 --> 02:43:11.286]  And that doesn't mean that Mexicans don't have a reason to dislike whites because whites have been mean to them, but that's a minority of whites.
[02:43:11.907 --> 02:43:20.054]  That doesn't mean that I can't see why white supremacists want to circle the wagons primitively against groups that don't like them, but that's not all the blacks and Hispanics that hate them.
[02:43:22.096 --> 02:43:23.417]  I understand how this happens.
[02:43:23.497 --> 02:43:24.958]  I'm not even judging these groups.
[02:43:25.979 --> 02:43:27.681]  I'm just telling you that you're wrong.
[02:43:29.555 --> 02:43:37.919]  And if you want to defeat the Sax-Kobar-Gothas and the Germanic death cult, then please don't email me saying that I hate Germanic peoples now.
[02:43:37.939 --> 02:43:44.162]  You know, it's like when I was criticizing the Communist Chinese during Clinton's era, oh, I didn't like Asians.
[02:43:44.969 --> 02:43:45.389]  Please.
[02:43:45.529 --> 02:43:53.133]  I mean, I am Alsatian, which is German-French and German on both sides of my mother's family.
[02:43:53.714 --> 02:44:00.717]  And I'm English, and I'm Welsh, and Irish, and Scottish.
[02:44:01.458 --> 02:44:05.320]  I mean, I'm just a good old Heinz 57, even a little bit of Native American.
[02:44:06.488 --> 02:44:09.370]  So I certainly don't hate white Europeans.
[02:44:09.490 --> 02:44:22.101]  I think white Europeans are a marvelous group of people that have contributed so much to society, so stoic, have so many attributes, and other variations of the human species have a lot to offer too.
[02:44:23.742 --> 02:44:26.924]  And so I have pride that I am an Anglo-Saxon.
[02:44:27.725 --> 02:44:29.366]  I am proud of being white.
[02:44:32.157 --> 02:44:34.218]  And I expect you to be proud of being black.
[02:44:34.678 --> 02:44:37.359]  And I expect you to be proud of being Hispanic.
[02:44:37.379 --> 02:44:39.919]  But most Hispanics don't even know what that means.
[02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:43.060]  You're a Native American-Spanish mix.
[02:44:43.601 --> 02:44:44.421]  A lot of German.
[02:44:44.441 --> 02:44:45.721]  A lot of Portuguese in there.
[02:44:47.522 --> 02:44:48.622]  You don't even know who you are.
[02:44:49.863 --> 02:44:51.683]  And most Jews don't know who they are.
[02:44:51.703 --> 02:44:53.104]  I mean, the Jews...
[02:44:55.427 --> 02:44:58.789]  When the Romans came into Germania, they came in.
[02:44:58.829 --> 02:44:59.930]  They've been there ever since.
[02:44:59.970 --> 02:45:02.672]  They're totally inbred with the Germanic tribes.
[02:45:02.732 --> 02:45:10.437]  Most of these so-called Jews don't even have a thimble of Semitic blood from the Middle East in them.
[02:45:12.138 --> 02:45:14.660]  And the dominant little sect, again, are Khazarian.
[02:45:14.680 --> 02:45:16.101]  They're not even Jews, people!
[02:45:18.463 --> 02:45:19.824]  And I'm sick of it.
[02:45:20.384 --> 02:45:24.547]  People don't even... Those that don't know the past are doomed to repeat it.
[02:45:25.555 --> 02:45:27.595]  And I really am sick of people helping the New World Order.
[02:45:27.735 --> 02:45:31.516]  I am tired of this orgy of Jew bashing.
[02:45:32.316 --> 02:45:33.257]  It is pointless.
[02:45:33.377 --> 02:45:34.497]  It is hurtful.
[02:45:35.157 --> 02:45:37.898]  So many good Jewish people listen to that and get turned off.
[02:45:38.238 --> 02:45:41.078]  So many other people hear that and are turned off.
[02:45:41.218 --> 02:45:44.659]  You are helping... I have their handbooks!
[02:45:45.799 --> 02:45:46.579]  It's published!
[02:45:46.639 --> 02:45:47.280]  It's public!
[02:45:47.320 --> 02:45:48.020]  They love it!
[02:45:48.060 --> 02:45:49.220]  The globalists love it!
[02:45:49.972 --> 02:45:56.073]  The Sachsberg Gothas, Sachs-Coburg Gothas absolutely love it!
[02:45:57.673 --> 02:46:08.955]  And they've been scapegoating Jews for so long, that is the Zionist top Jews and the Germanic death cults, have been scapegoating Jews every time that European peoples were abused.
[02:46:09.755 --> 02:46:12.676]  And it is a very sophisticated system we're dealing with.
[02:46:13.476 --> 02:46:19.257]  Israel is a drug dealing, child kidnapping, cesspool of evil.
[02:46:20.157 --> 02:46:20.517]  It is.
[02:46:21.037 --> 02:46:22.238]  So is Saudi Arabia.
[02:46:22.338 --> 02:46:24.959]  I mean, frankly, I think Saudi Arabia's got it over Israel.
[02:46:24.979 --> 02:46:25.759]  They're even worse.
[02:46:26.339 --> 02:46:27.240]  Do you know what they do?
[02:46:28.460 --> 02:46:30.141]  Let's talk about Saudi Arabia a little bit.
[02:46:30.181 --> 02:46:33.102]  I mean, all these countries are run by evil people.
[02:46:33.122 --> 02:46:34.082]  That's what the Bible says.
[02:46:34.403 --> 02:46:36.003]  The devil's got his people in power.
[02:46:36.703 --> 02:46:42.185]  But because Ariel Sharon is a gigantic hog goblin, uh, doesn't mean that Jews are bad.
[02:46:43.426 --> 02:46:47.407]  Just because he radiates evil, uh, you know, doesn't mean that Jews are bad.
[02:46:48.288 --> 02:46:48.668]  And, uh,
[02:46:49.631 --> 02:46:53.237]  Matt, it just drives me up the wall because you're helping the New World Order.
[02:46:54.319 --> 02:46:55.521]  Let's talk to Richard in Ohio.
[02:46:55.582 --> 02:46:56.303]  Richard, go ahead.
[02:46:56.323 --> 02:47:02.073]  Yes, I was calling in about the lady who called in last Friday, the Hispanic lady.
[02:47:03.088 --> 02:47:05.390]  She was complaining about white people being racist.
[02:47:05.530 --> 02:47:07.391]  She said, I can't trust any white people.
[02:47:07.631 --> 02:47:10.453]  I don't want to kill you, but short of that, you're pretty bad.
[02:47:10.974 --> 02:47:15.397]  Yes, I didn't know if you caught that or not, but she was talking so fast, I was wondering if you caught that.
[02:47:15.597 --> 02:47:31.128]  No, I don't know if we should kill all of you, because I was on TV going, well, you say you want to cut all our... Matcha has rallies with pictures of white people's heads cut off, and it's disgusting, and she was like, well, I don't know if I want to kill you.
[02:47:32.130 --> 02:47:34.791]  Yes, he said, uh, I don't want to have to kill you or something.
[02:47:34.991 --> 02:47:35.791]  I didn't know if you caught that.
[02:47:35.811 --> 02:47:36.912]  She was talking so fast.
[02:47:37.172 --> 02:47:40.313]  Sir, my wife speaks Spanish and we listen to Mexican radio.
[02:47:40.673 --> 02:47:43.754]  They got a channel here in Austin called The Invasion.
[02:47:46.755 --> 02:47:47.155]  Go ahead.
[02:47:47.455 --> 02:47:50.396]  Yes, but she didn't even sound like she had an Hispanic accent.
[02:47:51.196 --> 02:47:51.396]  Me.
[02:47:51.416 --> 02:48:00.159]  I was just wondering if she was really... Well, it just shows how... I mean, look, it shows how these groups don't even know how tribal and racist they are.
[02:48:02.169 --> 02:48:03.289]  I was just talking about that.
[02:48:04.029 --> 02:48:08.110]  She's telling me I'm probably a racist while she's saying she doesn't trust any white people.
[02:48:08.930 --> 02:48:10.751]  Yeah, she'll probably never call back in on the show.
[02:48:11.431 --> 02:48:13.711]  The woman's at least half white!
[02:48:14.451 --> 02:48:14.651]  Yeah.
[02:48:15.031 --> 02:48:16.232]  You know, that's something I'll never get.
[02:48:16.772 --> 02:48:19.732]  You'll have a black guy who might be an eighth black.
[02:48:20.092 --> 02:48:21.132]  He calls himself black.
[02:48:23.653 --> 02:48:24.953]  It's just ridiculous.
[02:48:24.973 --> 02:48:26.593]  Most people don't even know who they are.
[02:48:27.134 --> 02:48:28.714]  Again, I go back to that.
[02:48:28.734 --> 02:48:29.314]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:30.316 --> 02:48:32.480]  I'll talk to Elias in Michigan, and that's it.
[02:48:32.500 --> 02:48:33.843]  I'll hit a few final news articles here.
[02:48:34.384 --> 02:48:35.886]  Always great taking masses of calls.
[02:48:37.369 --> 02:48:38.832]  You don't know who you are, do you?
[02:48:38.892 --> 02:48:40.414]  Well, you better find out!
[02:48:41.016 --> 02:48:41.677]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:46.443 --> 02:48:53.847]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.108 --> 02:48:58.850]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.071 --> 02:49:04.714]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:04.974 --> 02:49:09.477]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:09.697 --> 02:49:16.862]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:16.882 --> 02:49:21.365]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.585 --> 02:49:24.087]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.327 --> 02:49:30.111]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitution.
[02:49:30.151 --> 02:49:30.431]  That's 888-253-3139

[02:50:45.026 --> 02:50:48.408]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:50:48.648 --> 02:50:48.989]  Why?
[02:50:49.309 --> 02:50:51.931]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[02:52:10.145 --> 02:52:10.865]  Go ahead, Elias.
[02:52:11.026 --> 02:52:12.366]  Oh my gosh, I finally got it.
[02:52:12.526 --> 02:52:16.668]  Okay, I only have a little thing and I hope your caller, what was his name, Chris?
[02:52:17.508 --> 02:52:18.269]  Uh, yeah.
[02:52:18.509 --> 02:52:19.709]  Who you were talking about?
[02:52:20.249 --> 02:52:21.370]  He wanted proof.
[02:52:21.830 --> 02:52:22.850]  The man wants proof.
[02:52:23.371 --> 02:52:24.331]  Yeah, the baby wants proof.
[02:52:24.711 --> 02:52:26.132]  He wants the smoking gun.
[02:52:26.372 --> 02:52:27.592]  Okay, I got a little quote.
[02:52:28.333 --> 02:52:31.334]  He said he accepted that Hitler burned the Reichstag.
[02:52:32.594 --> 02:52:36.376]  Well, a comparable quote here is that
[02:52:37.182 --> 02:52:41.786]  The Reichstag was burned by nobody who knows who did it.
[02:52:41.906 --> 02:52:42.646]  There was no proof.
[02:52:43.447 --> 02:52:46.149]  There's no proof that Hitler or his minions burned the Reichstag.
[02:52:46.410 --> 02:52:53.435]  Well, not so... See, Chris accepted from you when you mentioned that, that he accepted that Hitler did burn the Reichstag, but there is no proof.
[02:52:53.555 --> 02:52:56.838]  Respectfully, Elias, you've got to call back in next week, because we have more time.
[02:52:57.138 --> 02:52:58.419]  Well, I heard him say that.
[02:52:58.459 --> 02:52:59.320]  That's what brought it to me.
[02:52:59.360 --> 02:53:00.501]  Because there is no proof.
[02:53:00.621 --> 02:53:01.362]  Of course there is.
[02:53:01.402 --> 02:53:04.424]  There will never be any proof of these things that these people do.
[02:53:04.604 --> 02:53:06.606]  There's no proof that Nero burned Rome.
[02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:08.818]  But does he accept that?
[02:53:09.158 --> 02:53:10.019]  I hope he listens.
[02:53:10.039 --> 02:53:12.101]  Because there is no proof of these things.
[02:53:12.121 --> 02:53:15.764]  There will never be any proof that this government destroyed the WTC.
[02:53:15.784 --> 02:53:17.865]  There will never be any proof.
[02:53:17.966 --> 02:53:19.247]  Even when the owner says he blew it up.
[02:53:19.267 --> 02:53:19.907]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:20.167 --> 02:53:21.488]  Look, I've got to say this, Elias.
[02:53:21.629 --> 02:53:23.250]  I appreciate it.
[02:53:23.270 --> 02:53:24.431]  See, you're not really debating that.
[02:53:24.671 --> 02:53:28.494]  I mean, I'm not saying everything in the encyclopedia is true, but the encyclopedia says he did.
[02:53:29.015 --> 02:53:30.356]  No, they got the Nazi documents.
[02:53:31.397 --> 02:53:33.278]  Herman Goering was there on site.
[02:53:33.678 --> 02:53:35.360]  Witnesses saw that the essay
[02:53:36.918 --> 02:53:43.801]  Running around and they're setting the fires, and they grabbed a retarded individual, a homeless person, and tried to blame him for it, and couldn't even convict him of it.
[02:53:45.181 --> 02:53:49.623]  So yes, Hitler did burn his Reichstag, and they got the Nazi documents, and later German soldiers talked about it.
[02:53:50.163 --> 02:53:55.465]  Killing Poles, dressing them up in German outfits, and saying the Poles had killed them at the radio relay system.
[02:53:56.005 --> 02:53:59.066]  So, that's all documented, and yes, that's true, and they did it, okay?
[02:54:00.792 --> 02:54:03.856]  Oh my goodness, what a wild broadcast today.
[02:54:04.497 --> 02:54:14.851]  Open door on the Patriot Act, San Francisco Chronicle, with all the recent filibustered hype and the Senate Intelligence Committee had hoped to quietly retreat to a closed door session to mark up and expand the so-called Patriot Act.
[02:54:15.558 --> 02:54:26.202]  The heated nuclear option debate thwarted the plan, but the committee members quickly rescheduled the secretive meeting that was held on May 26th, where it ended without consensus.
[02:54:26.862 --> 02:54:33.764]  On Tuesday, the committee plans to continue its closed-door session, and with the filibuster out of the way, the issue must get the public scrutiny it deserves.
[02:54:34.104 --> 02:54:35.645]  Very serious, that's coming up.
[02:54:36.405 --> 02:54:39.046]  Radical expansion of that.
[02:54:40.907 --> 02:54:41.547]  Then there's this.
[02:54:41.587 --> 02:54:44.088]  Simpson Brenner, snitch or go to jail,
[02:54:45.696 --> 02:54:46.076]  Bill.
[02:54:47.077 --> 02:54:48.097]  And it's H.R.
[02:54:48.117 --> 02:54:48.097]  1528.
[02:54:48.257 --> 02:54:56.923]  If you don't cattle on somebody you think may be using drugs, years in prison and massive, gigantic fines.
[02:54:57.003 --> 02:54:58.044]  It's in the bill.
[02:54:58.664 --> 02:55:01.386]  The total East German Stasi Society.
[02:55:02.067 --> 02:55:04.468]  Israeli troops admit an eye for an eye killings report.
[02:55:04.508 --> 02:55:07.771]  If somebody kills an Israeli soldier, they just go out and kill somebody else.
[02:55:07.851 --> 02:55:09.132]  Doesn't matter if they're innocent or not.
[02:55:09.472 --> 02:55:10.673]  The Nazis did that too.
[02:55:10.753 --> 02:55:11.533]  It's wrong when they did it.
[02:55:11.573 --> 02:55:12.554]  It's wrong when Israel does it.
[02:55:13.635 --> 02:55:16.597]  The judge is ordering the release of Abu Ghraib videos and photos.
[02:55:17.118 --> 02:55:18.199]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[02:55:18.259 --> 02:55:26.465]  A judge has ordered the government to release the videos from Abu Ghraib prison and dozens of photographs from the same collection and photos touched on by Iraqi prisoner abuse scandal a year ago.
[02:55:26.805 --> 02:55:27.646]  Dozens of photos?
[02:55:27.666 --> 02:55:29.928]  They said there were thousands of photos and hundreds of videos.
[02:55:30.448 --> 02:55:31.969]  So look for that to be a whitewash.
[02:55:33.991 --> 02:55:35.492]  Oh, I am just flat out of time.
[02:55:35.532 --> 02:55:39.976]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central, and I'll see you down there at the Alamo Draft House.
[02:55:40.016 --> 02:55:41.657]  Sold out this week, sold out next week.
[02:55:42.927 --> 02:55:45.969]  So we're having another showing June 16th, 7.30 p.m.
[02:55:46.609 --> 02:55:48.130]  Thursday, June 16th.
[02:55:48.210 --> 02:55:49.631]  The Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[02:55:49.691 --> 02:55:50.351]  Another showing.
[02:55:52.112 --> 02:55:54.074]  I hope to see you out there.

[02:56:21.436 --> 02:56:27.779]  We all deserve liberty and freedom and we should all love our children, so let's fight the dehumanizing New World Order.
[02:56:28.179 --> 02:56:29.580]  Let's get out there and take them on.
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:31.181]  Have a great weekend.
[02:56:31.221 --> 02:56:32.441]  God bless you all.
