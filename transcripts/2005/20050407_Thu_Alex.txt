[00:00:05.942 --> 00:00:06.603]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.263 --> 00:00:08.323]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.023 --> 00:00:10.123]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.784 --> 00:00:11.624]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:13.284]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.304 --> 00:00:17.605]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:22.226]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.246 --> 00:00:26.867]  It is the 7th day of April, 2005.
[00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:29.128]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.968 --> 00:00:33.489]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we're gonna have an update.
[00:00:34.833 --> 00:00:47.604]  From the Arizona border, from the Minutemen, thousand-plus Americans down there simply reporting to the Border Patrol when they see illegal aliens pouring across by the thousands.
[00:00:47.704 --> 00:00:57.012]  But since they set up a week ago, thousands and thousands and thousands of illegals have been stacking up on the border.
[00:00:57.072 --> 00:00:59.134]  The Mexican troops are swarming around
[00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:06.346]  Trying to bust them and truck them to other areas where the Minutemen are not watching the border.
[00:01:07.086 --> 00:01:14.670]  And as you know, George Bush last week, with Lord Fox, criticized the Minutemen as evil vigilantes.
[00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:22.914]  And as I've told you many times, you've seen it yourself, the government wants you to tattle and spy on your neighbors for no reason at all.
[00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:29.678]  Don't you dare go down on that border, don't you dare get on that cell phone, and don't you dare call that border patrol.
[00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.171]  And the Border Patrol, we've had the head of their union on.
[00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:37.232]  They've been told, let the Mexican troops shoot at you.
[00:01:37.272 --> 00:01:38.572]  Do not return fire.
[00:01:38.612 --> 00:01:42.214]  Let them drive five, six, seven miles across the border.
[00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:43.594]  Let them machine gun your vehicles.
[00:01:44.314 --> 00:01:45.275]  Let them kill you.
[00:01:45.315 --> 00:01:51.217]  They've killed, what, two Border Patrol agents, Forest Service agents, FBI, you name it.
[00:01:51.237 --> 00:01:52.457]  They just love it.
[00:01:52.637 --> 00:01:54.177]  The news doesn't really pick up on it.
[00:01:54.197 --> 00:01:55.178]  It'll be a minor footnote.
[00:01:55.738 --> 00:01:57.258]  Oh, another federal officer killed.
[00:01:57.318 --> 00:01:58.759]  Well, that's just how it is.
[00:01:59.873 --> 00:02:05.256]  Nobody gets in trouble, though, because the globalists want the border open.
[00:02:05.897 --> 00:02:09.979]  And what they want, they usually get until the citizens take action.
[00:02:11.921 --> 00:02:20.326]  Well, a site out of England that's been very accurate in the past in tracking Bilderberg group activities is reporting that they believe
[00:02:21.112 --> 00:02:38.088]  But they know, we had Jim Tucker on last week, he wasn't sure yet where the meeting would be from American Free Press, but Bilderberg.org believes it will be the Hotel Olympia, or Olymp, has been cited as the likely venue, but we shall see.
[00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:45.695]  They're reporting that the 2005 Bilderberg meeting will probably take place in Munich, Germany on the 9th or the 12th of May.
[00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.852]  The Beslan Parents Fear Troops Killed Hostages.
[00:02:52.432 --> 00:02:54.373]  That's United Press International.
[00:02:54.453 --> 00:02:55.433]  And we have the archive.
[00:02:55.894 --> 00:02:58.315]  Beasland School Massacre Inside Involvement.
[00:02:58.335 --> 00:03:01.436]  We've got about, I don't know, 20-30 articles there about that.
[00:03:02.156 --> 00:03:04.477]  You might want to go to prisonplanet.com and check it out.
[00:03:04.517 --> 00:03:05.238]  That's right!
[00:03:05.878 --> 00:03:09.880]  All the evidence, it's even big news in Europe, well now in United Press International.
[00:03:10.703 --> 00:03:12.804]  People believe it's the government.
[00:03:12.844 --> 00:03:15.986]  Well, that's because the evidence shows it was the government.
[00:03:16.486 --> 00:03:19.067]  We'll explain how they did it when we get back.
[00:03:20.568 --> 00:03:23.989]  Same story over and over and over again.
[00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.932]  Radio journalist shot on US-Mexico border.
[00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:37.538]  A radio reporter in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico's border with Texas, was in serious condition for being shot several times by an unknown gunman.
[00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:40.562]  The latest journal is to be attacked along the border in recent months.
[00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:46.390]  Ah, and of course, as usual, it's connected to the government-controlled gangs.
[00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:56.823]  And for those that haven't read the Dallas Morning News or the Brownsville Newspaper, we have Mexican troops in Dallas machine gunning and blowing up vehicles.
[00:03:57.123 --> 00:04:01.044]  But again, can you imagine if some arable's doing that?
[00:04:01.685 --> 00:04:09.727]  It'd be top news everywhere, but Mexican troops do it, and man, it's the back of the Dallas Morning News if you're lucky.
[00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:14.228]  Nah, just Special Forces troops blowing people's cars up.
[00:04:14.448 --> 00:04:15.088]  Again, it's no big deal.
[00:04:16.225 --> 00:04:17.545]  Because they don't want you to know about it.
[00:04:17.785 --> 00:04:19.026]  It's not big national news.
[00:04:19.066 --> 00:04:22.566]  Well, it'll be big news here on this broadcast.
[00:04:22.626 --> 00:04:24.067]  I have a gigantic stack of news.
[00:04:24.627 --> 00:04:25.907]  I haven't even scratched the surface.
[00:04:26.427 --> 00:04:28.587]  I'm going to blitz through news and then take your calls.
[00:04:28.607 --> 00:04:32.008]  We've got a Minute Man update coming up, as I said earlier.
[00:04:32.528 --> 00:04:36.389]  And Paul Watson joins us every couple of weeks.
[00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:41.330]  He'll be joining us in the next hour with his report from the prison planet.
[00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:49.547]  My webmaster for PrisonPlanet.com and a great analyst in the war against the New World Order.
[00:04:50.608 --> 00:04:53.729]  So, strap yourselves in and get ready!
[00:04:53.869 --> 00:04:54.649]  We'll be right back!
[00:05:01.309 --> 00:05:08.155]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.455 --> 00:05:09.837]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.037 --> 00:05:12.239]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:14.481]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.761 --> 00:05:19.685]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.025 --> 00:05:24.049]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:26.090]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:36.816]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and buyable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:38.858]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:39.058 --> 00:05:42.920]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the Info War.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.301]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:48.103 --> 00:05:50.086]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:50.126 --> 00:05:55.135]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:56.076]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.876 --> 00:06:02.516]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:02.636 --> 00:06:06.717]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:06.877 --> 00:06:09.758]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:09.838 --> 00:06:16.560]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.740]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.341]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:27.022]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[00:06:27.022 --> 00:06:27.862]  We're good to go!
[00:06:52.076 --> 00:06:52.116]  803-4438.
[00:06:52.156 --> 00:06:52.617]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:52.637 --> 00:06:54.200]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:00.535 --> 00:07:02.877]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:03.138 --> 00:07:06.982]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[00:07:07.302 --> 00:07:08.123]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.543 --> 00:07:12.687]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:12.907 --> 00:07:17.092]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.472 --> 00:07:22.337]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:22.717 --> 00:07:26.279]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:31.823]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:32.103 --> 00:07:34.825]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:35.125 --> 00:07:36.026]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:36.326 --> 00:07:47.053]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[00:07:47.433 --> 00:07:48.834]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:48.874 --> 00:07:49.914]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:07:49.934 --> 00:07:50.434]  Big Brother.
[00:07:50.454 --> 00:07:51.335]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:09.046 --> 00:08:14.510]  Alright, coming up in the next segment we will be talking to the spokesman
[00:08:40.367 --> 00:08:55.733]  Ray Deacon for the Minutemen down on the Arizona border trying to stem the unbelievable flood of thousands of illegals a day in just a few square mile area.
[00:08:57.553 --> 00:09:09.478]  That is coming up and the latest thing is some hitmen down on the border killed a radio reporter who reported on Mexican drug gangs
[00:09:10.405 --> 00:09:12.747]  She was brutally shot nine times.
[00:09:14.989 --> 00:09:21.894]  And this is just a total and complete travesty.
[00:09:21.934 --> 00:09:27.799]  They have killed so many federal officers, so many police officers, so many citizens.
[00:09:27.839 --> 00:09:30.060]  The raping, the slaughtering, the murdering.
[00:09:31.382 --> 00:09:33.743]  Many of the towns only fly the Mexican flag now.
[00:09:33.803 --> 00:09:35.565]  English is not allowed in court proceedings.
[00:09:35.665 --> 00:09:38.127]  Again, that's San Antonio Express News.
[00:09:39.153 --> 00:09:51.122]  It is the equivalent of the Ku Klux Klan taking over entire areas and just basically telling blacks that they can't even come into town, period.
[00:09:52.843 --> 00:09:56.867]  But this woman is Hispanic and they shot her brutally nine times.
[00:09:57.447 --> 00:10:07.855]  Anybody that stands up against the kidnapping, the sex slavery, I mean they found houses down on the border and even in Houston with hundreds of women slaves in them.
[00:10:09.044 --> 00:10:10.105]  And it is horrible.
[00:10:10.185 --> 00:10:15.009]  They have also found giant satanic compounds with hundreds of dead bodies.
[00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:19.433]  Videos of them cutting their hearts out and doing satanic ceremonies.
[00:10:20.154 --> 00:10:21.255]  Folks, you think I'm joking?
[00:10:21.315 --> 00:10:23.917]  If you live in Texas, you know about this.
[00:10:25.018 --> 00:10:30.302]  People don't know about this, though, in other parts of the country because, again, it's compartmentalized news.
[00:10:31.663 --> 00:10:33.765]  It is total bedlam on the border.
[00:10:34.855 --> 00:10:38.737]  And most people are just moving out of the area, regardless of what color they are.
[00:10:39.857 --> 00:10:42.898]  And it is so sad to see this happening.
[00:10:44.019 --> 00:10:47.820]  If you're tuning in for the first time and you don't believe me, folks, this stuff's really going on.
[00:10:48.981 --> 00:10:54.683]  In the Brownsville paper and the Dallas Morning News, just a few weeks ago reported that Mexican troops
[00:10:56.056 --> 00:11:09.246]  Mexican special forces that work for the drug lords are murdering people in Central Texas, South Texas, San Antonio, Dallas, even small time drug dealers that are cutting in on their turf.
[00:11:10.267 --> 00:11:19.954]  And again, we have the Mexican Army as the enforcers are being machine gunned and having their cars blown up, burned, and it gets a small mention in the paper.
[00:11:21.232 --> 00:11:26.033]  And in Latin America, good reporters, good people that stand up against the corruption get killed.
[00:11:27.213 --> 00:11:31.434]  And I'll continue to talk and expose these people, and if they want to gun me down, that's fine.
[00:11:32.294 --> 00:11:33.295]  Because I'm not afraid of them.
[00:11:34.095 --> 00:11:35.155]  In the end, they're going to lose.
[00:11:35.435 --> 00:11:37.556]  I don't like people that kidnap women and children.
[00:11:38.116 --> 00:11:40.236]  I don't like people that deal heroin and cocaine.
[00:11:40.836 --> 00:11:48.998]  And just because you've got the support of Washington, and the support of Mexico City, and the support of New York banks, doesn't mean you own and run this country.
[00:11:49.802 --> 00:11:56.705]  But New York wants to use the Mexican Mafia and the Mexican troops as their muscle to help break up this country.
[00:11:56.905 --> 00:11:57.665]  And they're doing it!
[00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.908]  Here's an example just of how they cover up what's happening.
[00:12:05.448 --> 00:12:09.690]  There has been a four-fold increase, and the last time I saw the numbers was like three years ago.
[00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:11.231]  I'm told it's even gotten worse.
[00:12:12.151 --> 00:12:16.593]  A four-fold increase from a decade ago in tuberculosis.
[00:12:17.313 --> 00:12:19.274]  Drug resistant or drug immune.
[00:12:20.385 --> 00:12:30.770]  And the illegal aliens come in, they stick their children right next to your children in the schools, the public schools, and then your children sit there and breathe this.
[00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:38.754]  We've got all these different other third world diseases now that are spreading all over the country.
[00:12:40.135 --> 00:12:47.258]  People are coming in from Russia, China, we usually talk about Latin America, because that is the predominant group.
[00:12:48.365 --> 00:12:52.306]  You've got, what, 300 and something million people in Latin America.
[00:12:53.206 --> 00:12:54.026]  That's more than that.
[00:12:54.567 --> 00:12:55.747]  And they all want to come up here.
[00:12:56.867 --> 00:13:02.649]  And their country's populations are growing by about 9% to 7% a year.
[00:13:03.469 --> 00:13:15.892]  And their despotic regimes and our own banks in New York that run those places and have destroyed any chance they had of freedom are also directing their populations up here.
[00:13:17.253 --> 00:13:26.882]  But quite frankly, the even more resistant and deadly diseases are coming out of Russia and China and Vietnam.
[00:13:27.923 --> 00:13:32.507]  And it's really, really bad in the East and in Chicago and other areas.
[00:13:33.208 --> 00:13:34.909]  And I talk to doctors all the time.
[00:13:35.690 --> 00:13:39.934]  Whooping cough, something that had been eradicated in this country, is back.
[00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.921]  Thousands of people a month are going into clinics.
[00:13:43.202 --> 00:13:44.742]  I just am sick all the time.
[00:13:44.782 --> 00:13:45.383]  I don't know why.
[00:13:45.783 --> 00:13:49.785]  I have upper respiratory and lower respiratory problems.
[00:13:50.386 --> 00:13:51.887]  And they go, well, you've got whooping cough.
[00:13:52.987 --> 00:13:58.611]  But again, the average person, you've got to read CDC documents.
[00:13:58.631 --> 00:14:01.372]  You've got to read state health department documents.
[00:14:01.392 --> 00:14:02.653]  You've got to look for this stuff.
[00:14:03.619 --> 00:14:06.921]  I mean, you'd think that should be big news, but it's not big news!
[00:14:07.561 --> 00:14:14.105]  So whether you're Hispanic, or black, or white, or Asian, do you want your children sitting next to people?
[00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:15.806]  Do you want people preparing your food?
[00:14:16.466 --> 00:14:21.249]  When you go through these restaurants, and these drive-thrus, who've got all these diseases?
[00:14:22.617 --> 00:14:23.958]  We are a nation of immigrants.
[00:14:24.038 --> 00:14:27.681]  I don't think we should stop all immigration, but 2-3 million a year?
[00:14:27.701 --> 00:14:32.745]  I mean, at the height of Ellis Island, it was like 350,000 a year.
[00:14:33.306 --> 00:14:34.787]  And they checked the people.
[00:14:35.648 --> 00:14:38.390]  And if you had TB, they quarantined you and treated you.
[00:14:40.172 --> 00:14:41.152]  Or sent you back.
[00:14:42.213 --> 00:14:49.679]  Now, it's just... I mean, bird flu, avian flu... And we can sit around and go, ah, so what?
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.241]  But this is serious!
[00:14:53.186 --> 00:14:58.068]  It's more serious than the Mexican troops blowing up cars in Dallas, Texas!
[00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:13.635]  But overall, the bigger news story than the diseases and the gangs and all of it, the bigger story in all of this is that the media never covers it!
[00:15:17.297 --> 00:15:18.697]  Alright, I'm ranting.
[00:15:19.298 --> 00:15:19.698]  It's just...
[00:15:22.574 --> 00:15:24.555]  They're tearing this country apart right in front of us.
[00:15:26.656 --> 00:15:30.278]  And let me just dig this report out about this young lady that got shot.
[00:15:30.298 --> 00:15:34.040]  And then I want to get into some international news.
[00:15:36.001 --> 00:15:37.902]  We'll have an update from the Minutemen coming up.
[00:15:40.903 --> 00:15:44.145]  Radio journalist shot on US-Mexico border.
[00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:45.806]  This is out of Reuters.
[00:15:49.187 --> 00:15:50.968]  A radio reporter in New
[00:15:53.695 --> 00:15:54.696]  Nuvo Laredo.
[00:15:55.796 --> 00:15:56.517]  I'm just brain dead.
[00:15:56.557 --> 00:15:56.917]  I'm sorry.
[00:15:56.957 --> 00:15:58.778]  I should be able to read Spanish better.
[00:15:59.138 --> 00:16:00.219]  Nuevo Laredo.
[00:16:00.359 --> 00:16:00.999]  I know that.
[00:16:01.039 --> 00:16:01.820]  Why did I read it wrong?
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:08.443]  On Mexico's border with Texas was in serious condition after being shot several times by an unknown gunman.
[00:16:08.924 --> 00:16:09.944]  The latest journalist.
[00:16:10.044 --> 00:16:10.705]  Oh, the latest!
[00:16:11.345 --> 00:16:13.566]  To be attacked along the border in recent months.
[00:16:14.367 --> 00:16:18.689]  Guadalupe Garcia Escamilla, 39, was hit by nine bullets.
[00:16:20.854 --> 00:16:28.118]  As she arrived at a radio, a stereo, 91, to do her regular show on crime and public safety.
[00:16:28.918 --> 00:16:38.644]  According to the prosecutor's office in the border state of T-A-M-A-U-L-I-P-A-S.
[00:16:39.444 --> 00:16:43.106]  Temple Lewis, I'm sorry, I apologize to our Spanish speakers.
[00:16:43.666 --> 00:16:45.427]  I can hardly read English, much less Spanish.
[00:16:45.848 --> 00:16:49.930]  Officials were investigating whether the attack was motivated by her work
[00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:56.443]  Miguel Chavez, spokesman for the prosecutor's office, said, yeah, it's probably the Mexican officials that had her shot.
[00:16:56.903 --> 00:17:00.665]  Oh, we're trying to ascertain if the crime reporter was shot.
[00:17:01.865 --> 00:17:11.108]  We're trying to ascertain if trees are green and the ocean is blue, and we're trying to ascertain if a duck quacks and waddles when it walks.
[00:17:12.369 --> 00:17:13.469]  We're trying to ascertain
[00:17:15.836 --> 00:17:16.596]  I'm not going to say it.
[00:17:16.716 --> 00:17:17.516]  What bears do.
[00:17:18.417 --> 00:17:18.957]  In the woods.
[00:17:18.997 --> 00:17:22.297]  It's just out of control.
[00:17:22.937 --> 00:17:27.518]  Officials were investigating whether the attack was motivated by her work.
[00:17:27.638 --> 00:17:29.219]  Gee, let me wonder here.
[00:17:29.239 --> 00:17:30.979]  Revenge.
[00:17:30.999 --> 00:17:31.919]  Organized crime.
[00:17:31.999 --> 00:17:36.860]  No line of investigation has been discarded.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:39.041]  Well, when they say that, that means they're going to discard it.
[00:17:39.181 --> 00:17:40.901]  Oh no, it was just some random person.
[00:17:43.582 --> 00:17:45.543]  Oh boy, it's a serious condition.
[00:17:45.583 --> 00:17:47.123]  She isn't dead yet, thank God.
[00:17:48.283 --> 00:17:50.584]  That's another report I've got here of another dead journalist.
[00:17:50.624 --> 00:17:53.305]  Excuse me, there's so many, I'm getting them all mixed up here.
[00:17:54.285 --> 00:17:57.666]  As rival cartels battle, uh, rival cartels?
[00:17:58.706 --> 00:18:04.208]  No, you'll have the powerful cartels, controlled by the government, fighting with low-level cartels that aren't playing ball.
[00:18:04.228 --> 00:18:05.508]  That's the only fighting going on.
[00:18:06.207 --> 00:18:12.292]  As rival cartels battle for control of the lucrative trade in cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamines, the U.S.
[00:18:12.332 --> 00:18:16.735]  border has become a dangerous place for reporters, media groups warn.
[00:18:17.335 --> 00:18:17.715]  Really?
[00:18:17.795 --> 00:18:18.936]  It's become dangerous?
[00:18:20.177 --> 00:18:23.820]  You want to try being kidnapped by Mexican troops if they don't kill you right on the spot?
[00:18:25.341 --> 00:18:32.166]  As they openly, we've got video of them carrying the backpacks across, full of the goodies, cocaine, heroin, marijuana,
[00:18:33.220 --> 00:18:35.181]  And our government's told, you leave them alone.
[00:18:35.241 --> 00:18:37.203]  Well, yeah, they're making deliveries for the President.
[00:18:37.863 --> 00:18:38.944]  So I'm serious, folks.
[00:18:38.984 --> 00:18:39.984]  I'm not joking around.
[00:18:40.304 --> 00:18:41.905]  But the people the President represents.
[00:18:43.807 --> 00:18:45.288]  30 plus million a day.
[00:18:46.828 --> 00:18:48.489]  Going through Mena, Arkansas.
[00:18:50.951 --> 00:18:52.412]  And that was George Bush Sr.
[00:18:52.452 --> 00:18:53.252]  and Clinton's deal.
[00:18:53.753 --> 00:18:55.314]  You didn't know those guys were in business together?
[00:18:55.914 --> 00:18:57.815]  Well, the love fest is pretty apparent today.
[00:18:58.035 --> 00:18:58.896]  That was all staged.
[00:19:00.396 --> 00:19:03.239]  Got an article here out of United Press International.
[00:19:05.001 --> 00:19:07.944]  And the Beslan parents fear troops killed hostages.
[00:19:07.984 --> 00:19:08.804]  We have an archive.
[00:19:09.265 --> 00:19:11.087]  School massacre, inside involvement.
[00:19:12.108 --> 00:19:19.815]  Beslan residents have told federal prosecutors that forces storming a school to free hostages there last spring used flamethrowers and anti-tank grenades.
[00:19:20.716 --> 00:19:21.777]  Well, that was on TV.
[00:19:22.798 --> 00:19:23.259]  They had to
[00:19:24.213 --> 00:19:29.996]  After the special forces that had kidnapped everybody slipped out the back, they gave the radio order to their buddies outside.
[00:19:30.496 --> 00:19:33.217]  They went in and had to slaughter everybody so there wouldn't be witnesses.
[00:19:34.638 --> 00:19:38.840]  And they grab one person, admittedly torture him, and he confesses to being the mastermind.
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.901]  And there's like a hundred pieces of evidence, but it's a classic Putin op.
[00:19:43.702 --> 00:19:44.902]  Same thing happened in the theater.
[00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:50.625]  I'll explain how they do this when we get back, after the Minuteman update.
[00:19:51.972 --> 00:19:54.793]  So, a lot more coming up, jam-packed broadcast.
[00:19:55.334 --> 00:19:57.655]  I'm probably looking at about 50 more articles I want to cover.
[00:19:58.055 --> 00:19:59.195]  They're all just as serious.
[00:20:01.916 --> 00:20:05.598]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:20:05.998 --> 00:20:11.420]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:20:11.881 --> 00:20:12.961]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:20:13.001 --> 00:20:17.023]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:20:17.683 --> 00:20:30.995]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:20:31.516 --> 00:20:36.800]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:20:37.121 --> 00:20:42.946]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[00:20:53.033 --> 00:20:53.093]  1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.332 --> 00:21:12.058]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:21:12.239 --> 00:21:19.823]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:20.083 --> 00:21:23.225]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:21:23.485 --> 00:21:29.247]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving the nutritional minerals your body needs.
[00:21:29.507 --> 00:21:35.669]  Made of durable Lexan, the material used in making bulletproof glass, the system is durable, rugged, and yet attractive.
[00:21:36.029 --> 00:21:39.930]  The Berkey Light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[00:21:39.970 --> 00:21:41.851]  The water level is always visible.
[00:21:42.031 --> 00:21:48.014]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.

[00:22:01.617 --> 00:22:04.080]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:07.684]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[00:22:07.704 --> 00:22:13.390]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[00:22:14.351 --> 00:22:19.296]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[00:22:20.358 --> 00:22:22.160]  This is minimum infringement.
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:23.341]  There may be more.
[00:22:24.526 --> 00:22:31.328]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[00:22:32.009 --> 00:22:39.851]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:23:00.785 --> 00:23:06.308]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[00:23:06.508 --> 00:23:14.032]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented Paynex 2000 to the public.
[00:23:14.193 --> 00:23:20.796]  The Paynex 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle, and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.
[00:23:20.996 --> 00:23:22.357]  Now it's available to you.
[00:23:22.537 --> 00:23:29.121]  The Paynex 2000 is FDA cleared for joint aches and pains, increases circulation, and relaxes those achy muscles.
[00:23:29.321 --> 00:23:33.623]  Diametics has literally written the book on polychromatic infrared diotherapy.
[00:23:33.904 --> 00:23:40.167]  Using five different wavelengths in the Paynex 2000 has made it the most advanced infrared light therapy product on the market today.

[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:10.044]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.644 --> 00:24:13.626]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.588 --> 00:24:23.452]  All right, uh, Gray Pekin is the, uh, head coordinator for the volunteers for the Minuteman Project.
[00:24:25.146 --> 00:24:28.767]  And I'll repeat myself.
[00:24:29.267 --> 00:24:37.229]  Bush has told us in his terrorist manuals to spot terrorists if a man and woman are arguing on the side of the street, call the police on them.
[00:24:37.809 --> 00:24:40.050]  If you smell marijuana, call police on them.
[00:24:40.810 --> 00:24:43.731]  If somebody's walking down the side of the road with a backpack,
[00:24:44.815 --> 00:24:46.315]  I've done that many times out hiking.
[00:24:47.055 --> 00:24:48.176]  Call the police on them.
[00:24:48.256 --> 00:24:52.877]  If you have road atlases or world atlases in your car, call the police on you.
[00:24:53.217 --> 00:24:55.497]  If you're wearing a wristwatch, call the police on you.
[00:24:55.737 --> 00:24:56.497]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[00:24:56.537 --> 00:24:58.518]  Type wristwatch sign of terrorism.
[00:24:59.498 --> 00:25:01.198]  Get just the widest net possible.
[00:25:01.238 --> 00:25:03.258]  People selling Rubik's Cubes are terrorists.
[00:25:03.739 --> 00:25:05.639]  People that complain too much are terrorists.
[00:25:06.159 --> 00:25:08.239]  Teenagers set off a little bitty smoke bomb.
[00:25:08.259 --> 00:25:09.100]  One of the little bitty ones.
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.660]  And it charges a terrorist.
[00:25:12.498 --> 00:25:15.919]  But, the Minuteman Project, Bush has said they're evil vigilantes.
[00:25:16.439 --> 00:25:21.700]  They're just down there calling the Border Patrol when they see the illegals pouring across the border by the thousands.
[00:25:23.041 --> 00:25:30.443]  And the ACLU and other groups, other loyal opposition groups of the New World Order have been out there harassing them.
[00:25:31.363 --> 00:25:37.545]  And joining us with an update from the border for this segment and a little bit of the next segment is Gray Deacon.
[00:25:37.585 --> 00:25:38.725]  Gray, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:25:39.555 --> 00:25:40.916]  Oh, thank you very much Alex.
[00:25:41.096 --> 00:25:42.918]  I'm glad to be with you and your listeners today.
[00:25:43.638 --> 00:25:46.020]  There have been two journalists shot in the last few days.
[00:25:46.221 --> 00:25:49.523]  One dead, another in critical condition, shot nine times.
[00:25:50.004 --> 00:25:55.848]  She's a Mexican on the border reporting on the crime cartels and they shot her nine times.
[00:25:56.589 --> 00:26:00.392]  But I guess Bush might call her an evil vigilante now.
[00:26:02.071 --> 00:26:16.459]  Anybody who is standing against the smuggling of human beings, the smuggling of illegal contraband, and the smuggling of weapons and drugs is considered a vigilante, yes.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:20.361]  Well, I guess they like to kill women and shoot women.
[00:26:20.881 --> 00:26:21.841]  Well, I don't know about that.
[00:26:21.862 --> 00:26:23.302]  This is the first I've heard of that story.
[00:26:23.582 --> 00:26:24.543]  Yeah, it's out of Reuters.
[00:26:24.583 --> 00:26:29.666]  Well, there's several of them, but in this particular case, radio journalists shot on the U.S.-Mexico border, yeah.
[00:26:30.166 --> 00:26:30.326]  No.
[00:26:31.827 --> 00:26:33.870]  She was an anti-corruption crime reporter.
[00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:35.251]  Oh, that's terrible.
[00:26:35.972 --> 00:26:40.278]  Yeah, her name is Guadalupe Garcia.
[00:26:41.199 --> 00:26:43.842]  Continuing, you guys have been very effective.
[00:26:44.162 --> 00:26:46.305]  How many days into what you're doing?
[00:26:46.726 --> 00:26:50.090]  Well, we're actually working on day 8 right now.
[00:26:52.421 --> 00:26:53.502]  And give us an update.
[00:26:53.522 --> 00:26:57.745]  Last time I talked to you on Monday, you had backed up thousands and thousands of illegals.
[00:26:58.125 --> 00:27:01.848]  Mexican troops were there moving them out of the area, trying to outflank you guys?
[00:27:02.508 --> 00:27:04.329]  That's exactly what's been happening, Alex.
[00:27:04.429 --> 00:27:10.313]  We have Mexican troops on the other side of the line, and they are doing everything they can to
[00:27:11.616 --> 00:27:14.617]  And of course, Lord Bush is helping orchestrate all that.
[00:27:14.657 --> 00:27:17.618]  Have you heard the latest news out of the Associated Press?
[00:27:17.638 --> 00:27:18.558]  Tucson, Arizona?
[00:27:18.698 --> 00:27:20.979]  Minuteman Project volunteers face probe.
[00:27:36.343 --> 00:27:37.323]  No, I haven't heard that.
[00:27:37.663 --> 00:27:49.386]  They're saying three volunteers patrolling the border for illegal immigrants were being investigated after a man told authorities he was held against his will and forced to pose for a picture holding a t-shirt with a mocking slogan.
[00:27:50.046 --> 00:27:56.748]  We caught them in Texas bearing false witness in a staged FBI operation a few years ago with Ranch Rescue.
[00:27:56.808 --> 00:27:57.948]  Are you familiar with this new thing?
[00:27:58.815 --> 00:28:20.309]  Well, basically, I've been told that an individual not in very good shape was walking up to a fence, which is by Highway 92, and a couple of our people that were working for the project were on their way to one of the observation sites, saw the man, asked him if he needed any help,
[00:28:21.181 --> 00:28:21.841]  I don't think so.
[00:28:45.217 --> 00:28:50.400]  Gave him water and sat and talked to him while he was waiting for the, um... Yeah, but give me a break.
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:56.563]  You've got criminals coming across the border and, uh, you could do a citizen's arrest right there.
[00:28:56.583 --> 00:28:58.003]  I know you guys aren't getting into that.
[00:28:58.063 --> 00:28:58.984]  You aren't doing that.
[00:28:59.044 --> 00:28:59.184]  No.
[00:28:59.384 --> 00:29:01.225]  But at the same time, give me a break.
[00:29:01.665 --> 00:29:05.587]  I mean, this... We are trying... We're being very PC in this operation, Alex.
[00:29:06.147 --> 00:29:12.370]  We're making sure we're extremely politically correct and following the President's directive to the letter.
[00:29:12.550 --> 00:29:13.831]  We're being very observant.
[00:29:14.525 --> 00:29:20.948]  We report unusual behavior to the appropriate authorities and we do not take any physical overt action.
[00:29:21.008 --> 00:29:21.888]  Now that makes sense.
[00:29:22.468 --> 00:29:24.449]  Having that policy stops infiltrators.
[00:29:24.809 --> 00:29:29.651]  Well, it also stops misinterpretations of what we are doing here.
[00:29:30.731 --> 00:29:33.732]  Well, they don't misinterpret, they lie about what you're doing.
[00:29:35.053 --> 00:29:36.473]  Well, I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:29:36.533 --> 00:29:40.255]  Nobody seems to care when Mexican troops rape and beat people to death.
[00:29:41.307 --> 00:29:45.372]  But boy, if you give somebody water, man, that is very Al-Qaeda-ish!
[00:29:45.953 --> 00:29:46.954]  We'll be right back, Ray.
[00:29:46.974 --> 00:29:47.274]  Stay there.
[00:29:47.294 --> 00:29:48.115]  I've got some more questions.
[00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:52.941]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.402 --> 00:29:55.043]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.924 --> 00:29:58.608]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.465 --> 00:30:07.990]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:09.210]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:30:09.311 --> 00:30:10.191]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:30:10.311 --> 00:30:13.154]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:30:13.334 --> 00:30:18.217]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:30:18.458 --> 00:30:19.558]  Check out this new product.
[00:30:19.719 --> 00:30:22.601]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:30:22.961 --> 00:30:26.664]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[00:30:26.844 --> 00:30:29.326]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[00:30:29.566 --> 00:30:34.392]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:30:34.672 --> 00:30:37.816]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[00:30:37.916 --> 00:30:43.342]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:30:43.422 --> 00:30:44.203]  Try Nobeo.
[00:30:44.304 --> 00:30:46.306]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:30:46.466 --> 00:30:48.048]  Nobeo is so highly concentrated,
[00:30:48.228 --> 00:30:49.350]  A little goes a long way.
[00:30:49.531 --> 00:30:52.416]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-BO.
[00:30:52.597 --> 00:30:55.061]  Check out their website at NO-BO.com.
[00:30:55.242 --> 00:30:58.528]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NO-BO.
[00:30:58.709 --> 00:30:59.490]  That's NO-BO.com.
[00:31:01.582 --> 00:31:04.604]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.904 --> 00:31:09.847]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:10.108 --> 00:31:14.470]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.751 --> 00:31:23.676]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.877 --> 00:31:27.479]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:32.827]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:33.107 --> 00:31:39.817]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.313 --> 00:31:40.974]  What about you?
[00:31:41.614 --> 00:31:49.520]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:31:59.427 --> 00:32:07.793]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregasin, Oreganol, OregaMax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[00:32:08.133 --> 00:32:09.354]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated,
[00:32:09.794 --> 00:32:20.401]  Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil and particularly the P-7-3 oregason, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose with a 100% kill.
[00:32:20.861 --> 00:32:25.544]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural urban spice products from North American Urban Spice.

[00:32:45.537 --> 00:32:46.657]  Herbs and spices or doctors and drugs.

[00:32:47.498 --> 00:32:49.399]  Call 877-817-9829 to order your North American Herb and Spice products today.
[00:33:17.045 --> 00:33:30.379]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central back from 9 to midnight central I'm your host Alex Jones oh by the way for the third hour for the daytime broadcast the first two hours are on 9.985
[00:33:33.931 --> 00:33:36.753]  But in the third hour it switches to 9.975.
[00:33:36.793 --> 00:33:39.194]  9.975 and then of course 9 to midnight central on shortwave at 32.10.
[00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:39.854]  That's 32.10.
[00:33:47.961 --> 00:34:05.571]  Or on your local AM or FM station, or at InfoWars.com, or PrisonPlanet.com, and if those streams ever fill up, and you can't get on one of the streams on my website, you can go look for some of the other streams that are listed at the top of the page at GCNLive.com, the GCN Radio Network, Genesis Network.
[00:34:06.854 --> 00:34:08.935]  Going back to Gray Deacon.
[00:34:08.975 --> 00:34:10.235]  Gray, I just want to keep you a few more minutes.
[00:34:10.275 --> 00:34:13.317]  I know you're very, very busy there.
[00:34:13.917 --> 00:34:21.000]  How many volunteers total now that you have deployed in the field and how much of the Arizona border is covered?
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.540]  That's the first question.
[00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:32.784]  Secondarily, there is now government officials in New Mexico trying to invite you guys in, a very promising sign, wanting your help to stem the flow of murder and mayhem.
[00:34:33.843 --> 00:34:35.345]  Well, we welcome the invitations.
[00:34:35.425 --> 00:34:41.813]  We're trying to figure out how to meet all of the requests, and there's a lot of planning going on for the future.
[00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:47.220]  Alex, one of the things you need to understand is we're covering a section of the border that's about 60 miles long.
[00:34:48.294 --> 00:35:03.745]  The people that have been taking an active part of actually sitting on the static observation site, 531 people have been there, at least one 8-hour shift, and in addition they've spent a 4-hour training session out there.
[00:35:04.346 --> 00:35:12.772]  And we have been able to assist the Border Patrol in locating 188 illegal aliens entering this country.
[00:35:13.377 --> 00:35:29.842]  Even though the administration has brought in Border Patrol from New Mexico and California and other parts of Arizona, we have TAC teams in from the Forest Service and the National Parks Service.
[00:35:30.002 --> 00:35:36.744]  We have more Federals on this line right now than have ever been here in the history of the United States government.
[00:35:37.184 --> 00:35:40.145]  And that's all brought about by a bunch of grandmas and grandpas.
[00:35:40.816 --> 00:35:41.397]  We're good to go.
[00:35:57.728 --> 00:36:05.135]  For the people who are attempting to support the illegal aliens and defeat what we're trying to do.
[00:36:05.175 --> 00:36:13.082]  Now, literally, you are in the most crime-infested area of the country, this Cochise County area, folks, where millions of illegals come across a year.
[00:36:13.102 --> 00:36:15.724]  The fed zone average is 3,000 a day.
[00:36:15.844 --> 00:36:17.766]  Plus, you're there.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:33.626]  Simply reporting on what's happening, calling the Border Patrol, calling other authorities in an area where federal officers, Forest Service have been killed, houses have been machine-gunned, homes have been burned down, families have been kidnapped.
[00:36:33.666 --> 00:36:35.006]  It happens in Texas as well.
[00:36:35.487 --> 00:36:36.907]  This is all mainstream news, folks.
[00:36:37.507 --> 00:36:41.609]  And still you're being demonized by the press for your courage.
[00:36:42.515 --> 00:36:42.955]  Thank you.
[00:36:43.375 --> 00:36:44.596]  That's a good way of putting it.
[00:36:44.876 --> 00:36:50.818]  But what I'm asking right now is if there are listeners of yours who have the courage to come and join us.
[00:36:50.898 --> 00:36:54.339]  And I mean this takes real courage because you don't talk back.
[00:36:54.779 --> 00:36:59.560]  You don't fly any flag except the United States flag or the flag of your state.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.321]  You start no fires.
[00:37:01.921 --> 00:37:09.083]  You confront no one in any way either by shining bright lights in their eyes or yelling at them or trying to argue with them.
[00:37:09.103 --> 00:37:11.484]  You know this takes real courage.
[00:37:12.609 --> 00:37:21.673]  And if you've got the courage to join us, please go up on our website at Minutemanproject.com, read through our SOP.
[00:37:21.753 --> 00:37:23.694]  This is a strictly enforced SOP.
[00:37:23.734 --> 00:37:33.679]  And for people to understand this, it's because they've got provocateurs, they've got troublemakers, they've got people there trying to get you guys in trouble, trying to stop what you're doing.
[00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:40.162]  They hate it that you're bringing national attention to the fact that we are being invaded and that we are wide open.
[00:37:41.318 --> 00:37:44.459]  And this takes courage.
[00:37:44.539 --> 00:37:45.820]  You don't get to yell back.
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:48.201]  You don't get to throw signals of any kind.
[00:37:49.642 --> 00:37:55.044]  What you have to do is have the courage of your conviction to stand solid.
[00:37:57.285 --> 00:38:00.087]  You've got to stand up for this nation.
[00:38:00.127 --> 00:38:01.808]  It takes a lot of courage.
[00:38:01.828 --> 00:38:08.952]  Well, we're going to give that contact info out in a second and let you get out of here, Gray Deacon, and I appreciate your update, but I wanted to tell a brief story.
[00:38:09.392 --> 00:38:16.796]  I'm sure you know about Ranch Rescue went down to private ranches down in Jim Hogg County near the border.
[00:38:16.816 --> 00:38:21.739]  It was in mainstream news that Mexican troops were crossing with other foreign troops.
[00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:22.900]  The sheriff was on record.
[00:38:23.707 --> 00:38:27.568]  And these illegals from, I think it was Venezuela came across.
[00:38:29.289 --> 00:38:43.653]  Luckily, a French crew, a media crew, was there with news cameras and showed them, it was very cold, it was in the winter a few years ago, giving blankets and water to illegals, but calling the border patrol.
[00:38:44.566 --> 00:38:50.089]  And then the illegals leave, go and lie, turn out it was a staged deal, and claim that they'd been beaten.
[00:38:50.149 --> 00:38:55.391]  There was no evidence of that, but thank God they had French witnesses that none of it was true.
[00:38:55.771 --> 00:38:58.292]  This shows the type of stuff that's going on.
[00:38:58.312 --> 00:39:01.734]  I know you guys have got video cameras out there as well, correct?
[00:39:02.334 --> 00:39:02.955]  Yes, we do.
[00:39:02.995 --> 00:39:03.955]  That's our best weapon.
[00:39:04.055 --> 00:39:07.677]  Anybody who has video cameras, bring them with you.
[00:39:07.717 --> 00:39:10.358]  That's the only way that we can document the truth.
[00:39:11.115 --> 00:39:17.978]  Man, I've got super zoom video cameras because you talk about field glasses videotaping these Mexican troops helping stage the illegals.
[00:39:18.618 --> 00:39:24.360]  We have the official Mexican government document manual on how to get in here and how to destroy this country.
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:27.141]  But I really should go to this.
[00:39:27.821 --> 00:39:29.802]  Are you guys planning to have more of these in the future?
[00:39:30.142 --> 00:39:35.224]  Well, we've got a lot of things in the planning process right now, but we're in the first week of
[00:39:35.856 --> 00:39:47.040]  You know, coming to the end of the first week of organizing a brand new operation, and this has taken a lot of time and energy, and we're just trying to make this one work out the way it's supposed to work out.
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:55.063]  But this will be good training for future operations, perfecting and streamlining your command and control systems.
[00:39:57.044 --> 00:40:03.606]  Before we give out the contact info and let you get out of here, Gray, and then I'm going to take some calls, folks, before we do that,
[00:40:04.756 --> 00:40:09.058]  I have different news articles out of New Mexico with different government officials asking you to come in and help.
[00:40:09.398 --> 00:40:10.779]  Can you give us any details of that?
[00:40:11.519 --> 00:40:13.820]  No, I have no actual details on that.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:20.542]  I know there has been some requests for helping and planning and strategy.
[00:40:22.359 --> 00:40:25.221]  Right now, again, I am doing everything I can just to run this operation.
[00:40:25.261 --> 00:40:29.905]  But it's good to have county commissioners and sheriffs and people wanting you guys to come into their state.
[00:40:30.125 --> 00:40:37.952]  I had an opportunity to talk to a couple people over the weekend, and we're doing a lot of planning, but nothing is to the point where we can really talk about it, Chuck.
[00:40:37.992 --> 00:40:39.753]  But again, this is how it works at first.
[00:40:39.873 --> 00:40:43.196]  In the beginning, a patriot is a scarce man, hated and feared.
[00:40:43.696 --> 00:40:48.601]  But in time, when his cause succeeds, the Tim would join him, because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:40:49.001 --> 00:41:00.172]  You guys are really breaking the ice here, and what you're doing is good and wholesome, and we're going to see more and more local governments legitimize this, and this is very exciting.
[00:41:00.572 --> 00:41:01.894]  Give out your contact info.
[00:41:01.974 --> 00:41:06.498]  Well, that is Minutemenproject.com, all one word, lowercase.
[00:41:06.518 --> 00:41:07.499]  And when you get on there,
[00:41:08.184 --> 00:41:10.426]  Read the SOP carefully.
[00:41:10.626 --> 00:41:16.471]  This takes more courage to do what we're asking you to do than it takes to walk into gunfire.
[00:41:17.311 --> 00:41:21.154]  And believe me, I've got a lot of combat vets that have said that.
[00:41:21.635 --> 00:41:24.156]  So come on down here, help us out.
[00:41:24.577 --> 00:41:27.659]  If you can't come down, go to the PayPal site.
[00:41:29.521 --> 00:41:34.224]  Click on the Civil Homeland Defense, and we've got a PayPal site there.
[00:41:34.644 --> 00:41:35.505]  We need some money.
[00:41:35.565 --> 00:41:37.807]  There's also an address there if you want to send checks.
[00:41:38.777 --> 00:41:40.959]  We're putting it together on a shoestring.
[00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.382]  Anything you can do, we really appreciate.
[00:41:43.562 --> 00:41:45.504]  Yeah, you're having to pay for port-a-potties, all of it.
[00:41:45.585 --> 00:41:50.230]  Alright, thank you so much for coming on with us, and please contact me if there's any new developments.
[00:41:50.390 --> 00:41:51.111]  Thank you very much.
[00:41:51.331 --> 00:41:52.512]  Thank you, Gray Deacon.
[00:41:53.013 --> 00:41:56.937]  That's the head coordinator for the volunteer effort there on the border.
[00:41:57.097 --> 00:41:58.719]  And I got a bunch of articles here where
[00:41:59.637 --> 00:42:07.201]  We've got public servants, and that's what they really are, not officials or authorities, but public servants, wanting to do this in their area because they're tired of it!
[00:42:07.281 --> 00:42:08.562]  Everybody's leaving these towns!
[00:42:10.082 --> 00:42:11.083]  Including the Mexicans.
[00:42:11.663 --> 00:42:14.565]  And including even people who are illegals who've lived in these towns for decades.
[00:42:14.605 --> 00:42:15.085]  They're leaving.
[00:42:15.145 --> 00:42:15.725]  I've talked to them.
[00:42:15.986 --> 00:42:16.866]  They've called this show.
[00:42:17.466 --> 00:42:19.027]  I mean, it is bad, folks.
[00:42:19.047 --> 00:42:20.568]  Can you imagine being a town on the border?
[00:42:21.238 --> 00:42:34.689]  And every night there's illegals breaking into your car, breaking into your garage, in your backyard, drinking out of your water faucet, scaring your children on your back porch, raping your wife, raping your daughter, burning your house down.
[00:42:35.329 --> 00:42:47.459]  And I'm not saying all these people coming across are evil, but when you've got three mil a year going across, another million and a half crossing back over in this one county, it's the number one place in the country,
[00:42:48.809 --> 00:42:50.070]  And it's bad in Texas, too.
[00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:51.131]  It's bad in New Mexico.
[00:42:52.051 --> 00:42:54.993]  It's bad in California, but the worst is New Mexico.
[00:42:57.495 --> 00:43:12.665]  I mean, you've got a percentage of these that are criminals, that are rapists, that are... and then you've got on top of that just all these other smugglers, the coyotes, people bringing across the prostitutes, the women they've kidnapped.
[00:43:13.426 --> 00:43:16.328]  And then, folks, a lot of these Mexican drug dealers are devil worshippers.
[00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:26.852]  And if you do not believe me, just go to Google and type, uh, satanic cults, Mexican, Texas border.
[00:43:27.892 --> 00:43:32.553]  Just type that in, or type, uh, bodies found, satanic cult, Texas border.
[00:43:33.593 --> 00:43:40.895]  I mean, folks, ever since I was a little boy, it would be in the Dallas Morning News, the Texas Monthly, uh,
[00:43:41.816 --> 00:43:44.139]  And it never gets outside the state.
[00:43:44.159 --> 00:43:46.382]  I've talked to people in other areas.
[00:43:46.402 --> 00:43:47.483]  They don't even know about this.
[00:43:48.003 --> 00:43:49.906]  There needs to be movies made about this.
[00:43:50.006 --> 00:43:54.971]  I mean, why aren't people... I'll tell you who ought to...
[00:43:56.969 --> 00:44:00.650]  Make a movie about it as the director Rodriguez here in town.
[00:44:01.951 --> 00:44:03.391]  He makes films about the border.
[00:44:03.771 --> 00:44:05.832]  He ought to make a movie about these satanic cults.
[00:44:05.852 --> 00:44:06.953]  That'd be a pretty exciting movie.
[00:44:07.313 --> 00:44:10.494]  And plus it would raise the level of awareness about it.
[00:44:12.034 --> 00:44:17.476]  I mean, folks, they'd grab women, children, these college students, go across the border to party.
[00:44:17.976 --> 00:44:18.797]  And they'd grab them.
[00:44:18.877 --> 00:44:20.897]  And man, they'd get them and they'd torture them.
[00:44:20.917 --> 00:44:22.078]  They'd cut their hearts out.
[00:44:22.978 --> 00:44:24.839]  They'd cannibalize.
[00:44:25.989 --> 00:44:27.330]  Folks, you think I'm joking.
[00:44:28.770 --> 00:44:29.990]  I need to do a show on that.
[00:44:30.431 --> 00:44:32.951]  It's just every form of craziness.
[00:44:33.952 --> 00:44:52.678]  Well, it's been in the news that something like 150 women are missing in the last 15 years just down in one city on the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:44:53.398 --> 00:44:53.998]  El Paso.
[00:44:55.277 --> 00:45:01.160]  And they found a bunch of them out there in the sand right across the border with their innards cut out!
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:05.301]  I mean, this stuff is going on!
[00:45:06.002 --> 00:45:07.302]  That's one area!
[00:45:07.642 --> 00:45:08.963]  Then you've got Matamoros!
[00:45:09.063 --> 00:45:09.903]  It's even worse!
[00:45:10.023 --> 00:45:10.964]  Mochias!
[00:45:12.024 --> 00:45:13.985]  Do not get near these areas!
[00:45:16.386 --> 00:45:16.966]  Unbelievable.
[00:45:17.686 --> 00:45:21.268]  And then if a satanic cult doesn't get you, and again, it's not
[00:45:22.623 --> 00:45:26.025]  Kosher to talk about it in the mainstream news outside of Texas.
[00:45:26.065 --> 00:45:29.528]  It's like a secret outside of the state with this compartmentalized news.
[00:45:29.828 --> 00:45:41.816]  If they don't get you... Folks, I know people who've driven across the Mexican border, and they're down there fishing, and they got all their permits and stuff, and the cops dig through the whole truck and find one .22 shell.
[00:45:43.397 --> 00:45:44.117]  Not even a bullet.
[00:45:44.678 --> 00:45:45.939]  Not even a full round.
[00:45:46.059 --> 00:45:47.299]  You know, an expended round.
[00:45:47.340 --> 00:45:47.880]  A cartridge.
[00:45:48.627 --> 00:45:49.807]  And they take the truck.
[00:45:50.187 --> 00:45:51.147]  They hold the family.
[00:45:51.187 --> 00:45:51.908]  They extort.
[00:45:52.248 --> 00:45:53.668]  They find out how much money you're worth.
[00:45:54.368 --> 00:45:59.969]  And boy, if you're caught with an old shotgun shell, or not even a gun, and they will beat you up.
[00:46:00.389 --> 00:46:02.529]  Your family's got to go down there and bring you food every day.
[00:46:02.549 --> 00:46:03.470]  They won't even feed you.
[00:46:03.490 --> 00:46:04.510]  They'll let you starve to death.
[00:46:04.970 --> 00:46:06.330]  They will knock your teeth out.
[00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:12.531]  They will pour Tabasco down your nose until you tell your family to give everything out of your bank account.
[00:46:13.131 --> 00:46:15.312]  Can you imagine if we were treating Mexicans like that?
[00:46:15.332 --> 00:46:16.992]  And they do it to Mexicans, too.
[00:46:17.012 --> 00:46:17.792]  They do it to their own people.
[00:46:18.513 --> 00:46:20.334]  I'm not putting up with this, okay?
[00:46:22.174 --> 00:46:24.095]  And our government loves it, because this is the model.
[00:46:24.115 --> 00:46:26.075]  They want to make America like this.
[00:46:27.015 --> 00:46:27.455]  They love it.
[00:46:29.156 --> 00:46:32.797]  Let's talk to Tom in Kansas City, and then Jason and others.
[00:46:33.237 --> 00:46:33.917]  Tom, go ahead.
[00:46:33.937 --> 00:46:35.198]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:46:35.438 --> 00:46:36.558]  Really good show so far.
[00:46:36.898 --> 00:46:38.558]  I want to point out one thing.
[00:46:38.618 --> 00:46:42.440]  You read an article out of a Connecticut newspaper yesterday about the tag scanners.
[00:46:42.460 --> 00:46:46.381]  I've got two more articles today in other parts of the country.
[00:46:48.737 --> 00:46:49.217]  Tell us about it.
[00:46:49.558 --> 00:46:55.441]  Well, Tuesday evening on the CBS Evening News, they did a segment on the tag scanners.
[00:46:55.881 --> 00:47:05.987]  And I swear on my soul, word for word, what you read out of the Connecticut newspaper is the exact same thing that was stated over the air by the correspondent doing the thing.
[00:47:06.367 --> 00:47:11.210]  And what caught me is when you said something to the effect of, you know, it didn't take us long before we hit pay dirt.
[00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:16.373]  When I heard that on your broadcast, it immediately threw me back to watching that segment on it the other night.
[00:47:16.909 --> 00:47:18.731]  When I watched it, I was with my wife when we were out.
[00:47:18.751 --> 00:47:22.534]  I didn't get a chance to tape it, but I said to her, I said, you know, this looks scripted.
[00:47:22.574 --> 00:47:26.277]  You see this lady riding around with this crew, laughing and giggling, thinking it's all great.
[00:47:26.357 --> 00:47:27.498]  This is no way that this is real.
[00:47:27.518 --> 00:47:30.601]  And she says the exact same thing as a totally separate reporter.
[00:47:30.901 --> 00:47:31.441]  Exactly.
[00:47:31.942 --> 00:47:33.423]  No, listen, this is how you know.
[00:47:33.803 --> 00:47:36.445]  Look, all over the country, the same newscast.
[00:47:36.646 --> 00:47:39.788]  We're putting transponders in your cars, the roads will be toll roads.
[00:47:40.088 --> 00:47:41.370]  This is going to save you money.
[00:47:41.590 --> 00:47:44.012]  When their own documents say it's going to
[00:47:44.972 --> 00:47:45.633]  Well, let me see.
[00:47:45.713 --> 00:47:53.239]  Right now, let's say in a state like California with state and federal taxes, you might pay 60 cents a gallon of tax.
[00:47:53.739 --> 00:47:56.361]  Well, now the average car gets 25 miles a gallon.
[00:47:56.582 --> 00:47:59.424]  It's going to be 65 cents per mile, 65 cents times
[00:48:00.945 --> 00:48:07.150]  Times 25 is, we're talking over 3 bucks compared to 50, 60 cents.
[00:48:07.190 --> 00:48:08.591]  So how big of an increase is that?
[00:48:09.992 --> 00:48:10.653]  It's insane!
[00:48:10.753 --> 00:48:12.134]  It's the same thing with these articles.
[00:48:12.414 --> 00:48:13.335]  Oh, it's so wonderful!
[00:48:13.515 --> 00:48:20.741]  We're going to scan your license plates instantly with the computerized cameras and then send you a bill of your speeding.
[00:48:22.082 --> 00:48:24.843]  The day your insurance runs out, we're going to arrest you!
[00:48:25.063 --> 00:48:31.525]  Or if you haven't paid a parking ticket, it instantly alerts, and then we tow your car on the spot, and throw you out on the side of the highway!
[00:48:31.645 --> 00:48:32.865]  Oh, it's so good!
[00:48:33.465 --> 00:48:40.688]  Well, the thing I noticed about it, too, is that, you know, they were saying it in a cute setting, that, you know, going... It's always, you know, it's always fun!
[00:48:40.708 --> 00:48:42.368]  Oh, it's so good!
[00:48:42.428 --> 00:48:43.488]  Ha ha ha!
[00:48:43.709 --> 00:48:51.791]  Absolutely, and they're sitting there, and they went on, and they held up a library book, and they said, if you have overdue books, or if you built a pool without, you know, getting your permits, they'll be coming for your car.
[00:48:52.443 --> 00:48:53.443]  What are people thinking?
[00:48:53.503 --> 00:48:59.586]  How can people watch this and anybody from coast to coast in this country say, yeah, that's a good idea?
[00:48:59.906 --> 00:49:01.647]  It's about maximum enforcement.
[00:49:01.907 --> 00:49:07.129]  The most petty of things now, we instantly, instantly arrest you.
[00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:09.170]  We instantly take your vehicle.
[00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:10.971]  And then what happens when somebody
[00:49:11.611 --> 00:49:14.315]  You know, there's a computer glitch and somebody comes up owing taxes.
[00:49:14.576 --> 00:49:15.417]  They tow your car.
[00:49:15.537 --> 00:49:16.839]  It takes a month to strain it out.
[00:49:16.899 --> 00:49:19.763]  Meanwhile, you have a month's worth of tow yard charges piling up.
[00:49:20.084 --> 00:49:21.025]  Then you can't pay that.
[00:49:21.045 --> 00:49:22.347]  Well, the tow yards are... Look, look.
[00:49:22.607 --> 00:49:23.849]  I have the Washington Times.
[00:49:24.330 --> 00:49:27.575]  Three years ago, where they admitted never made national news.
[00:49:28.075 --> 00:49:40.927]  The cops, in uniform, own their own towing companies, they pull into McDonald's parking lots, people park properly, and the news station videoed it, and openly steal, uh, like five cars at a time, and then go chop-chop them.
[00:49:41.127 --> 00:49:46.632]  They're not even letting you get your car back, and a guy walks up and goes, give me my car, and the cop pulls the gun and goes, back off!
[00:49:47.072 --> 00:49:51.314]  I mean, they're openly stealing cars, the cops aren't chop-chopping them!
[00:49:51.354 --> 00:49:53.736]  Listen, there's trillions missing from the Pentagon.
[00:49:54.036 --> 00:49:56.817]  It's just an orgy of corruption, sir.
[00:49:57.258 --> 00:49:57.778]  Absolutely.
[00:49:58.138 --> 00:49:59.099]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:49:59.139 --> 00:50:02.801]  The cops actually steal your cars and chop-chop them in uniform.
[00:50:03.041 --> 00:50:04.522]  See, it's not even hidden anymore.
[00:50:05.102 --> 00:50:06.403]  Man, that's just insane.
[00:50:06.483 --> 00:50:09.564]  I can't... And then on another thing... And it's hidden in plain view!
[00:50:09.584 --> 00:50:11.665]  And then back on to the Minutemen.
[00:50:11.946 --> 00:50:12.766]  I commend these guys.
[00:50:12.786 --> 00:50:16.128]  I want to call them our Minutemen because they're defending our country in a
[00:50:16.567 --> 00:50:22.812]  You know, if I wasn't such an aggressive person, I would volunteer down there, but I think the only thing I would do would be harm their cause.
[00:50:23.192 --> 00:50:27.936]  Because I wouldn't be able to stand by idly while people, you know, completely desecrate our sovereignty.
[00:50:29.077 --> 00:50:30.418]  And, uh, I guess that's it.
[00:50:30.438 --> 00:50:31.279]  Have a good afternoon, Alex.
[00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:32.140]  Yeah, thanks for the call.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.783]  I don't mean to rant and rave when the caller calls in with stuff, but folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:50:36.463 --> 00:50:38.505]  It was like a five-part series in the Washington Times.
[00:50:38.525 --> 00:50:39.586]  A local news station did it.
[00:50:40.366 --> 00:50:44.990]  And it said that, well, cops are car thieves, and they're doing an
[00:50:47.111 --> 00:50:52.113]  Behind the front of towing companies and on duty they're doing it and no one will stop them.
[00:50:52.653 --> 00:50:53.453]  And it hasn't stopped!
[00:50:53.473 --> 00:50:54.914]  They just drive around stealing cars!
[00:50:55.534 --> 00:50:56.275]  Just... Ha ha!
[00:50:56.995 --> 00:50:57.615]  I'm not kidding!
[00:50:57.635 --> 00:50:58.435]  Ha ha!
[00:51:02.337 --> 00:51:05.198]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.922 --> 00:51:07.222]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.422 --> 00:51:13.164]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.444 --> 00:51:18.685]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:18.985 --> 00:51:23.126]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.306 --> 00:51:27.047]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.347 --> 00:51:31.908]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:32.048 --> 00:51:38.329]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.369 --> 00:51:40.250]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:51:58.414 --> 00:52:00.494]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:02.023 --> 00:52:05.027]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.368 --> 00:52:14.199]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:19.206]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.646 --> 00:52:26.369]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.769 --> 00:52:38.555]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:39.035 --> 00:52:43.499]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.659 --> 00:52:46.121]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:52:49.264 --> 00:52:50.725]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.745 --> 00:52:51.786]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:54:11.339 --> 00:54:13.140]  Folks, I don't care how crazy it sounds.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:17.721]  If I tell you DynCorp kidnapped 200,000 women and children, I can play Congressional Testimony right now.
[00:54:18.701 --> 00:54:22.822]  If I tell you trillions are missing, then we end up erring the Congressional Testimony.
[00:54:22.842 --> 00:54:24.762]  It's worse than what I said from the federal documents.
[00:54:25.923 --> 00:54:32.424]  If I tell you cops drive around in DC stealing cars openly and don't care, it's in the news.
[00:54:33.365 --> 00:54:39.226]  If I tell you there's devil-worshipping cults all over the Texas-Mexico border, I can pull out 100 mainstream news articles, literally.
[00:54:40.143 --> 00:54:41.764]  I mean, I wish this stuff wasn't through!
[00:54:42.104 --> 00:54:44.645]  I wish evil wasn't being released right now!
[00:54:45.305 --> 00:54:46.705]  But that's what tyranny is!
[00:54:46.806 --> 00:54:50.927]  It gets into positions of power, the criminals then go absolutely insane!
[00:54:52.408 --> 00:54:54.108]  And they tell you that they're the authorities!
[00:54:54.888 --> 00:55:01.091]  And they got a bunch of useful idiots in government who aren't bad people that work for the system, and ignore all the corruption of their left and their right!
[00:55:01.891 --> 00:55:03.772]  It endangers us all when this happens!
[00:55:05.172 --> 00:55:06.853]  Listen, my new film, Martial Law,
[00:55:07.722 --> 00:55:10.004]  9-11, Rise of the Police State is out.
[00:55:10.704 --> 00:55:12.206]  And this film isn't going to be seen.
[00:55:12.966 --> 00:55:13.847]  We have no power.
[00:55:14.507 --> 00:55:15.308]  Unless you get it.
[00:55:16.189 --> 00:55:17.590]  And unless you make copies of it.
[00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:19.251]  That's where it has the effect.
[00:55:20.412 --> 00:55:21.153]  And I'm begging you.
[00:55:22.273 --> 00:55:26.477]  Road to Tyranny and my other films have really done a lot of good because of you getting them and making copies.
[00:55:26.557 --> 00:55:27.598]  This is my best film.
[00:55:28.939 --> 00:55:30.260]  It's only three films in one.
[00:55:30.700 --> 00:55:32.421]  Two and a half plus hours long.
[00:55:32.501 --> 00:55:33.963]  Over three hours on DVD.
[00:55:35.564 --> 00:55:36.865]  And it is my best work.
[00:55:37.526 --> 00:55:42.488]  And it covers the police state, the occult elite, what really happened on 9-11 like no other film.
[00:55:42.909 --> 00:55:44.229]  And I just want it to be seen.
[00:55:44.829 --> 00:55:45.990]  I just want people to know the truth.
[00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:47.090]  And it'll wake people up.
[00:55:47.591 --> 00:55:49.051]  Please call and get it.

[00:55:57.775 --> 00:55:58.976]  So buy three copies.
[00:55:59.036 --> 00:56:00.897]  And it also supports this broadcast.
[00:56:00.937 --> 00:56:01.697]  We need your support.
[00:56:02.546 --> 00:56:04.267]  But, uh, just please get it.

[00:57:05.726 --> 00:57:07.107]  The War Zone, welcome!
[00:57:08.088 --> 00:57:09.469]  Hey Alex, I want to say
[00:57:10.788 --> 00:57:15.891]  Martial Law is the best film I've seen and I've watched every single one on Prison Planet TV.
[00:57:17.451 --> 00:57:18.712]  I'm a current subscriber.
[00:57:19.112 --> 00:57:26.316]  I just wanted to get your comments on somebody has an ad in the paper here in the Arizona Republic.
[00:57:26.356 --> 00:57:28.757]  It's Mark Osterloh.
[00:57:28.837 --> 00:57:32.799]  He was a gubernatorial candidate in 2002 for Arizona.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:37.281]  He is trying to get a ballot initiative for the 2006 ballot.
[00:57:38.939 --> 00:57:49.906]  Saying that every person who registers to vote and turns out to vote will be automatically entered to win a million dollars for every time, for every election year.
[00:57:50.226 --> 00:57:55.689]  To try to bolster the voting... No, that'll just encourage idiots to go vote.
[00:57:56.570 --> 00:58:02.854]  You know, the mindless fools out there that don't care about knowing the facts, that just want to register in some sweepstakes.
[00:58:03.374 --> 00:58:04.575]  I think it's an abhorrent idea.
[00:58:07.216 --> 00:58:08.436]  Yeah, basically that's it.
[00:58:08.456 --> 00:58:11.497]  He's paying a dollar per signature that you get.
[00:58:11.517 --> 00:58:20.339]  He's hiring people right now and he's paying you a dollar per signature and you have to be a registered voter in the state of Arizona and it's going for four or five months.
[00:58:20.359 --> 00:58:22.339]  Well, I thought that's illegal to pay for signatures.
[00:58:23.919 --> 00:58:24.280]  I don't know.
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:27.080]  I'm going to talk to him later to find out exactly what's going on.
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:28.720]  I know that's illegal in Texas.
[00:58:30.981 --> 00:58:31.581]  Well, that's all.
[00:58:31.601 --> 00:58:35.882]  I just wanted to let people know and let them know that some of the crazy ideas that
[00:58:37.871 --> 00:58:41.453]  People who could possibly be our governors are trying to get out there.
[00:58:41.653 --> 00:58:44.655]  Sounds like a disgusting, uh, gimmick.
[00:58:44.795 --> 00:58:45.636]  Thank you for the call.
[00:58:46.036 --> 00:58:48.037]  Transmission continues worldwide!
[00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:48.598]  Stay with us!
[00:58:48.998 --> 00:58:49.478]  Big Brother.
[00:58:49.498 --> 00:58:50.018]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:50.038 --> 00:58:54.361]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.808 --> 00:59:03.629]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.389 --> 00:59:05.269]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.289 --> 00:59:09.592]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.132 --> 00:59:14.254]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.296 --> 00:59:18.537]  Second hour of worldwide transmission.
[00:59:18.557 --> 00:59:19.978]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:20.118 --> 00:59:21.538]  Welcome to the Info Wars.
[00:59:22.299 --> 00:59:24.400]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:59:26.501 --> 00:59:29.083]  Well, more reporters being shot and injured, shot and killed.
[00:59:29.143 --> 00:59:31.464]  More Mexican troops running around shooting people.
[00:59:32.826 --> 00:59:39.272]  We've got the Minutemen peacefully on the Arizona border being demonized by the media just trying to report to the Border Patrol the illegals pouring across.
[00:59:39.732 --> 00:59:47.059]  We have more mainstream news coming out about the Russian troops actually running the Beesland Massacre as a pretext for control.
[00:59:47.599 --> 00:59:51.903]  Masses of news and information and wide open phones for the next two hours.
[00:59:52.484 --> 00:59:58.349]  And we have our good buddy, a report from the present planet, my webmaster and editor and
[00:59:59.521 --> 01:00:06.724]  Overall good analyst, Paul Watson, joining us from the enchanted isle over there, the United Kingdom.
[01:00:06.744 --> 01:00:10.686]  Paul, good to have you on with us today.
[01:00:11.426 --> 01:00:12.447]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:00:13.267 --> 01:00:14.627]  Boy, there is so much happening.
[01:00:14.667 --> 01:00:16.248]  Things are accelerating even more.
[01:00:17.529 --> 01:00:27.573]  Well, yeah, I mean, one thing we need to go back over is the whole Terry Sciarvo case, because last time I was on it was still in the media, which it seems to not be anymore.
[01:00:28.523 --> 01:00:33.489]  Um, how it connects to the Minuteman situation down on the Arizona border.
[01:00:34.610 --> 01:00:38.374]  And of course, um, these terror drills in New Jersey.
[01:00:38.895 --> 01:00:41.358]  Um, another showcase for the police state.
[01:00:42.503 --> 01:00:44.665]  and the fear-mongering over the biotech as well.
[01:00:45.085 --> 01:01:04.496]  And they're really coming out announcing, hey we're gonna use cameras to tax you and tax you and scan your license plates and transponders for all the toll roads and if you've got a late library book or haven't paid a parking ticket we're gonna just take your car on the spot and everything's control, control, control.
[01:01:04.516 --> 01:01:09.359]  Well yeah, they're even introducing the toll roads now in
[01:01:09.890 --> 01:01:12.631]  My own little county here in Britain, Yorkshire.
[01:01:13.331 --> 01:01:17.052]  So, I mean, that just shows you how worldwide this New World Order really is.
[01:01:18.693 --> 01:01:26.856]  In some places of Britain, the people voted against it, and they actually recognized the vote in Edinburgh, Scotland, and rejected it.
[01:01:27.576 --> 01:01:33.338]  But I guess down there in Texas, what was it, 95% of the people voted against it?
[01:01:33.378 --> 01:01:36.919]  Yeah, 98% in Houston, 93% in Austin, and they just said, we don't care!
[01:01:39.232 --> 01:01:40.132]  Well no, they don't care.
[01:01:40.833 --> 01:01:52.037]  And now with this CNN story about how the late library books will also be linked into the database, the same database as your car number plate will have on.
[01:01:52.797 --> 01:01:56.078]  So it's total information awareness by a different name.
[01:01:56.419 --> 01:01:58.719]  And if you don't turn that library book in, we're taking your car.
[01:01:59.900 --> 01:02:00.360]  Exactly.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.440]  All part of freedom.
[01:02:03.001 --> 01:02:04.622]  And I guess we'll just put up with it, huh?
[01:02:06.442 --> 01:02:07.903]  I guess we'll just lick their boots.
[01:02:09.395 --> 01:02:24.647]  Well, the thing about the Minuteman project, which I'm going to talk about anyway, was that people are not putting up with it and it's having a massive effect, which is why the media's on steroids to try and demonize these people as racists.
[01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:31.051]  They're talking to these racist Mexican groups.
[01:02:31.452 --> 01:02:34.374]  It was the supposed authority on the border situation.
[01:02:35.841 --> 01:02:43.926]  Who then demonize these people with lawn chairs and binoculars, in many cases watching from their own private property, as racists.
[01:02:44.726 --> 01:02:49.530]  And they'll give very little column inches to somebody like Chris Hincox.
[01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:57.895]  Meanwhile, Bush, Condoleezza Rice and the head of the Border Control Agency is out demonizing them as well.
[01:02:58.476 --> 01:03:03.199]  Because there's no agenda to protect the border if you're trying to create a Pan-American Union.
[01:03:04.110 --> 01:03:12.357]  But the media attention is focused away from that, even though the articles are out today where not one illegal has got through in Arizona.
[01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:18.923]  It's 100% success, and it's fertile ground to spread to other states.
[01:03:18.983 --> 01:03:20.344]  They're talking about Texas now.
[01:03:20.885 --> 01:03:23.307]  Yeah, and New Mexico officials want them to come there.
[01:03:23.327 --> 01:03:28.111]  So more and more, the mainstream propaganda machine is just ignored.
[01:03:29.284 --> 01:03:35.111]  It's completely ignored, which is part of what the Terri Schiavo thing was about, creating a smoke screen to ignore that.
[01:03:35.912 --> 01:03:42.079]  And the fact that people couldn't have an effect in the Terri Schiavo case is one of the major messages that was meant to be sent.
[01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.041]  Alright, let's talk about it all on the other side.
[01:03:44.081 --> 01:03:45.002]  Ante calls.
[01:03:45.903 --> 01:03:47.925]  Prepare to make the jump, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:03:48.165 --> 01:03:49.547]  Total information coming up.
[01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:57.875]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.055 --> 01:04:02.461]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.621 --> 01:04:07.006]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.046 --> 01:04:08.407]  The New World Order.

[01:07:19.438 --> 01:07:30.660]  We'll go to Chris in Kentucky and the others here in just a few minutes.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:32.541]  Paul, where to start?
[01:07:32.581 --> 01:07:41.583]  You know, I think one of the best places to start is the fact that United Press International is now reporting what we've known since
[01:07:42.429 --> 01:07:44.430]  Really, day one.
[01:07:45.331 --> 01:08:02.520]  And that is that the shootings in Russia at the school, just from what we saw on television, it was clear that it was another government operation, just like the theater massacre.
[01:08:03.401 --> 01:08:08.384]  And for those that perhaps have forgotten about that tragedy that was so
[01:08:10.879 --> 01:08:15.403]  Interestingly, covered by the media, had all the media just waiting, and Putin had them all in to cover it.
[01:08:16.103 --> 01:08:17.144]  Why don't you fill us in on it?
[01:08:18.305 --> 01:08:37.200]  Well, yeah, it's another article out of the United Press International, which talks about the Beslan residence, the parents of some of the children killed there, again accusing the security officials of being involved with and killing the children in the attack.
[01:08:37.941 --> 01:08:38.341]  Of course,
[01:08:39.036 --> 01:08:51.705]  Before the school siege happened back in September, we had these two Russian planes that blew up within minutes of each other, which was later blamed on what they called Chechen black widows.
[01:08:52.166 --> 01:08:57.009]  And then they planted fake passports there again, and it turned out they were fake, planted by the government.
[01:08:57.750 --> 01:09:06.957]  Yeah, and it turned out the so-called women involved in the attack, suicide hijackers again, turned up alive two weeks later.
[01:09:07.477 --> 01:09:08.398]  What does that remind you of?
[01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:21.460]  Even if you believe the official government version of events, the agents, you could call them, were allowed to get on the planes in the first place by Russian airport control.
[01:09:22.141 --> 01:09:27.025]  So a similar case with ATA and the others, if you believe that they were in fact direct agents.
[01:09:27.526 --> 01:09:30.889]  So it was preceded by that, which happened about a week before.
[01:09:31.852 --> 01:09:43.977]  And then the school siege, where it comes out that the so-called terrorists are actually communicating with a foreign intelligence agency, the nationality of which was never quite established.
[01:09:44.757 --> 01:09:51.060]  And then, what was it, for around four or five days, very little news came out.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:59.763]  The reporters that tried to report on the truth, anything that went against the government line, were beaten, arrested, tortured.
[01:10:01.032 --> 01:10:05.014]  But Fox News and others were allowed to then surround the school for the grand finale.
[01:10:05.754 --> 01:10:15.099]  Oh yeah, and it came just on the eve of this vote where Putin would abolish the governorship over these different areas of the country so he would have total control.
[01:10:16.002 --> 01:10:22.106]  And then the eyewitness reports of the military and the police doing the killings themselves.
[01:10:22.126 --> 01:10:24.207]  The hostages, most of them escaped.
[01:10:24.287 --> 01:10:26.848]  Then we were told that they were all killed.
[01:10:26.948 --> 01:10:32.812]  The only one on trial reported that he was tortured to admit to being involved in the attack.
[01:10:33.152 --> 01:10:49.927]  And for those that don't get how this works, and I could spend two hours on this, we've got the mainstream news articles posted, the stuff all comes out later, but when it's big top news, it's everywhere, you get the official lie, then later it comes out that, okay, that wasn't true, here's what really happened, but then it's in the back of some news wire.
[01:10:50.267 --> 01:10:58.514]  For those that don't understand, Putin, when he's vice president and Yeltsin's being pushed around in a wheelchair, former KGB chief from Leningrad,
[01:11:00.481 --> 01:11:03.828]  We've got Putin who wants to have a war with Chechnya.
[01:11:04.229 --> 01:11:05.992]  Three apartment buildings get blown up in 1999.
[01:11:07.344 --> 01:11:10.005]  Moscow police get mad because it's killing some of their own people.
[01:11:10.065 --> 01:11:11.106]  They set a sting up.
[01:11:11.706 --> 01:11:15.107]  Catch members of the FSB planting bombs on the pillars.
[01:11:15.647 --> 01:11:17.688]  It's hexogen, the same Russian explosive.
[01:11:18.048 --> 01:11:19.829]  Plastique, used in the other bombings.
[01:11:20.890 --> 01:11:21.810]  They arrest them.
[01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:23.211]  They say, yeah, we were ordered to do it.
[01:11:23.331 --> 01:11:24.311]  Then they change the story.
[01:11:24.351 --> 01:11:25.571]  No, it was just a drill.
[01:11:26.092 --> 01:11:27.712]  Putin has the police station raided.
[01:11:27.752 --> 01:11:28.953]  They take all the evidence.
[01:11:29.733 --> 01:11:32.634]  Members of the FSB go public and say, yes, we were ordered to bomb it.
[01:11:33.655 --> 01:11:36.436]  The news media that starts reporting on it, they get arrested.
[01:11:37.475 --> 01:11:41.256]  All that happens, the Chechens go on TV and go, why would we bomb you?
[01:11:41.316 --> 01:11:43.257]  And that would get support to invade us!
[01:11:43.557 --> 01:11:44.417]  We're not doing it!
[01:11:44.477 --> 01:11:45.397]  Your government is!
[01:11:45.917 --> 01:11:55.480]  And then as that general's on the phone doing an interview, they track it with a missile and shoot a missile right down onto him and kill him, the Russians did, as he's on radio going, I'M NOT DOING IT!
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:55.980]  IT'S THEM!
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:56.420]  PLEASE!
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.140]  OH NO!
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.001]  You know, I mean, literally, folks, this is happening.
[01:12:00.361 --> 01:12:02.282]  I mean, just use your common sense, folks.
[01:12:02.802 --> 01:12:03.102]  Then,
[01:12:04.315 --> 01:12:06.516]  Years later, we have the theater siege.
[01:12:06.576 --> 01:12:07.616]  Now, this is how it works.
[01:12:08.496 --> 01:12:09.316]  Men in masks.
[01:12:09.717 --> 01:12:10.417]  KGB.
[01:12:10.457 --> 01:12:11.437]  You know them as FSB.
[01:12:11.497 --> 01:12:12.917]  And this is what happened.
[01:12:13.518 --> 01:12:16.939]  They go in, put their masks on, have a siege, get all the news cameras.
[01:12:17.559 --> 01:12:24.921]  Then, and this was reported by the few survivors, the 160-something that weren't killed by the gas that the Russians admit they injected.
[01:12:25.161 --> 01:12:25.821]  The Russian government.
[01:12:26.441 --> 01:12:28.842]  Right minutes before it happens, they put masks on.
[01:12:29.828 --> 01:12:31.069]  The gas is injected.
[01:12:31.429 --> 01:12:38.212]  They admit that then the Russian troops pull back at least ten people who were supposed to be hostage takers.
[01:12:38.493 --> 01:12:39.813]  They slip out and leave.
[01:12:40.213 --> 01:12:40.914]  They escape.
[01:12:40.994 --> 01:12:41.674]  They're gone.
[01:12:42.214 --> 01:12:46.577]  And then the Russians come in, blazing, shooting people, making sure any witnesses are dead.
[01:12:46.937 --> 01:12:51.219]  And again, they grab one random person, torture them, drug them up, and then you never hear about it again.
[01:12:51.459 --> 01:12:52.059]  Same thing.
[01:12:52.740 --> 01:12:54.881]  Al-Qaeda is caught with hostages.
[01:12:54.921 --> 01:12:57.102]  They blow up a building in Saudi Arabia.
[01:12:57.242 --> 01:12:58.142]  CIA calls.
[01:12:58.182 --> 01:12:59.123]  This is mainstream news.
[01:12:59.523 --> 01:13:00.583]  Says, release them!
[01:13:00.783 --> 01:13:03.324]  And they let Al-Qaeda get in the cars and drive away.
[01:13:04.024 --> 01:13:07.025]  Same story in the Bali bombing.
[01:13:07.385 --> 01:13:09.866]  FBI pulls out of the hotel two hours before.
[01:13:10.286 --> 01:13:12.026]  FBI are seen on the ground.
[01:13:12.586 --> 01:13:13.086]  It's U.S.
[01:13:13.106 --> 01:13:17.948]  government explosives that are used, again, to get Australia behind the war, killing mainly Australians.
[01:13:18.368 --> 01:13:20.168]  Paul, this just goes on and on again.
[01:13:20.588 --> 01:13:23.249]  Same thing with the massacre at the school.
[01:13:23.849 --> 01:13:33.434]  They got the special forces go in and mask, hold it for a few days, then all of a sudden, the Russians say we attack with explosives, they admit, anti-tank weapons and flamethrowers.
[01:13:33.714 --> 01:13:39.857]  It's reported that the hostage takers leave out the back unmolested two minutes before this starts.
[01:13:40.418 --> 01:13:47.061]  It's all run militarily, and they just shoot a bunch of people, run out with some kids out of the front, and talk about how great they are!
[01:13:47.161 --> 01:13:48.802]  I'm sick of these people, Paul!
[01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:53.513]  They use the same tactics in every instance, because it never fails.
[01:13:53.913 --> 01:14:00.480]  It always comes out later, but the key is to pass off the light as it's happening, because then the investigation gets shut down.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:03.423]  With the Russian apartment buildings also...
[01:14:04.153 --> 01:14:11.856]  The first call made by the bombers after the foiled bombing was to the FSB, their handlers.
[01:14:12.016 --> 01:14:24.741]  The documentary made about the wave of apartment bombings was banned in Russia and the guy who made it, Berezovsky, can't go back to Russia on fear of arrest.
[01:14:25.889 --> 01:14:27.830]  Um, and same with Madrid.
[01:14:27.850 --> 01:14:35.334]  The bombs could only have been planted by people with access to the most secure levels of the Madrid train department.
[01:14:35.854 --> 01:14:38.756]  And then the suspects are later killed.
[01:14:38.776 --> 01:14:45.299]  One of which, who remains, as with the school siege, is tortured into admitting being involved.
[01:14:45.419 --> 01:14:46.400]  So it's the same M.O.
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:46.960]  every time.
[01:14:48.661 --> 01:14:54.544]  And in the case of Madrid, it came out that the President did know, there was clear funding going on, and then they blow up
[01:14:55.211 --> 01:14:58.715]  The building that the terrorists are supposedly in.
[01:14:58.755 --> 01:15:04.681]  Yeah, to eliminate any proof that they would have later of them being involved.
[01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:05.942]  It's the same case every time.
[01:15:06.923 --> 01:15:08.545]  We've got an archive on PrisonPlanet.com
[01:15:09.474 --> 01:15:16.521]  Which is linked to the UPI story, Beslan School Massacre Inside Involvement, with about 20 articles on that very subject.
[01:15:16.681 --> 01:15:24.188]  Beslan residents have told federal prosecutors that forces storming a school for free hostages there last September used flamethrowers and anti-tank grenades.
[01:15:24.508 --> 01:15:25.309]  Yeah, right away!
[01:15:25.849 --> 01:15:26.870]  Oh, we're assaulting it!
[01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:29.973]  Let's fire with our most heavy artillery right into the school!
[01:15:30.593 --> 01:15:34.357]  And minutes after, their compadres had already slipped out the back.
[01:15:35.177 --> 01:15:37.019]  And that's what people that survive said, yeah!
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:40.863]  The terrorists just slip out the back and then suddenly they attack.
[01:15:41.784 --> 01:15:44.487]  Folks, I mean, how much more stage does this have to get for you?
[01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:51.315]  I mean, in the school siege, just look at how they treated the media.
[01:15:51.915 --> 01:15:57.061]  One of the Georgian journalists was detained, who was a vociferous critic of Putin.
[01:15:57.668 --> 01:15:59.851]  Yeah, she was kidnapped and drugged.
[01:15:59.871 --> 01:16:01.432]  Yeah, that was in the news.
[01:16:01.452 --> 01:16:02.494]  These people are unbelievable.
[01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:15.273]  And again, we have a naive public poll that just can't get their mind around it.
[01:16:15.673 --> 01:16:20.097]  Operation Northwoods has these Beeslawn and theater-type sieges in it.
[01:16:20.157 --> 01:16:31.188]  It says, we'll have our troops dressed up like foreign troops, attack one of our military bases, shoot, kill, bomb, and then pull out, and then we can even go out and stage the capture of some people.
[01:16:31.448 --> 01:16:37.394]  It even describes how to frame patsies here in the U.S., how to carry out bombings, and then how to grab patsies.
[01:16:39.386 --> 01:16:54.655]  Yeah, I mean, it's a strategy of tension that the Gladio documents talked about, which were, again, similar attacks on soft targets, blamed on extremist groups to change the political face of the country and those European countries at the time.
[01:16:55.216 --> 01:16:59.138]  So the policy never changes if it keeps on being successful in each instance.
[01:17:01.626 --> 01:17:17.535]  How can so many children's movies, Paul, have this theme, this plot, you know, The Incredibles, Attack of the Clones, Final Fantasy, so many of these children's movies where the bad guy carries out terror attacks to blame it on his enemies so he can be the hero.
[01:17:18.956 --> 01:17:24.479]  Children understand it, but then I talk to adults and they see these movies and they go, I didn't get that plot.
[01:17:25.019 --> 01:17:26.780]  Is there like a mental block or something?
[01:17:28.052 --> 01:17:31.454]  Well, I mean, they do put it in the adult-orientated shows.
[01:17:32.895 --> 01:17:46.203]  In the first 24 show, the terrorist group laying off the nuke was sponsored by moguls linked to the oil industry and an inside faction of the government.
[01:17:46.543 --> 01:17:51.406]  So they even put it in their own torture promotion shows just to laugh in our faces about it.
[01:17:52.086 --> 01:17:52.847]  So it's everywhere.
[01:17:52.867 --> 01:17:55.888]  These people are so sick.
[01:17:55.968 --> 01:17:56.389]  In fact,
[01:17:57.307 --> 01:18:03.709]  For Scott on the broadcast, can you find, just go to searchinfowars.com and type in The Long Kiss Goodnight.
[01:18:06.491 --> 01:18:12.093]  That's a 1997 film, where the government's carrying out terror bombings for funding.
[01:18:12.113 --> 01:18:13.773]  They're going to bomb the World Trade Center for funding.
[01:18:14.073 --> 01:18:18.635]  And they even mention in the film how the government really did bomb the World Trade Center in 1993.
[01:18:19.516 --> 01:18:20.636]  Can you find that, Scott?
[01:18:22.276 --> 01:18:24.837]  I think it's in the computer, but we ought to play that when we get back.
[01:18:24.877 --> 01:18:28.098]  I want to take some calls, Paul, but what are some of the other things you want to cover as well?
[01:18:29.598 --> 01:18:33.179]  Terrorist Chiavo and these terror drills in New Jersey.
[01:18:33.539 --> 01:18:34.920]  Exactly what they're geared towards.
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:37.241]  Conditioning the public into accepting.
[01:18:37.981 --> 01:18:40.241]  And a lot of reports about Jeff Gannon coming out.
[01:18:40.261 --> 01:18:40.842]  Some new stuff.
[01:18:42.142 --> 01:18:44.923]  There is a report in the Des Moines Register yesterday.
[01:18:45.403 --> 01:18:45.663]  Yeah.
[01:18:45.823 --> 01:18:48.044]  We'll talk about it all on the other side.
[01:18:48.084 --> 01:18:49.904]  PrisonPlanet.tv, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:50.485 --> 01:18:51.385]  Your call's coming up.
[01:18:51.405 --> 01:18:51.785]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.031 --> 01:19:02.633]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:19:02.853 --> 01:19:14.135]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:19:14.355 --> 01:19:16.995]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:17.335 --> 01:19:21.436]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[01:19:21.656 --> 01:19:23.799]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:19:23.959 --> 01:19:25.821]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:19:26.022 --> 01:19:32.049]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:37.977]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[01:19:56.249 --> 01:20:00.850]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:20:01.170 --> 01:20:03.511]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[01:20:53.410 --> 01:20:55.912]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.553 --> 01:21:05.819]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[01:21:06.720 --> 01:21:13.545]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[01:21:14.445 --> 01:21:15.867]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:21:16.107 --> 01:21:19.169]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[01:21:20.129 --> 01:21:28.651]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:21:54.134 --> 01:21:55.275]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:55.575 --> 01:22:00.557]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:22:00.817 --> 01:22:03.418]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[01:22:03.618 --> 01:22:12.141]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:22:12.521 --> 01:22:20.968]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[01:22:21.108 --> 01:22:24.551]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[01:22:24.811 --> 01:22:32.237]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.
[01:22:32.537 --> 01:22:34.519]  You've all heard about products that energize your water.
[01:22:34.599 --> 01:22:35.960]  Don't be fooled by imitators.
[01:22:36.060 --> 01:22:40.884]  Visit Aquanorthwest.com to learn more about the benefits of positively charged energy water.
[01:22:41.204 --> 01:22:43.767]  Call 888-7AWA in W. That's 888-727-8269 or visit aquanorthwest.com.
[01:22:55.868 --> 01:22:56.328]  Don't worry.
[01:22:56.828 --> 01:22:58.349]  This show is documented.
[01:22:58.869 --> 01:23:01.530]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:05.552]  You know, Paul Watson, I don't mean to start ranting and raving.
[01:23:06.132 --> 01:23:11.234]  It's just to know the New World Order's game plan.
[01:23:22.677 --> 01:23:29.420]  And to watch him carry out attacks, do all these horrible things, and then poses our saviors, I get really sick of it.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:39.165]  It makes me just furious with them, and now to see their control grid going into place, it makes me very, very angry.
[01:23:39.205 --> 01:23:40.705]  What do you want to get into next?
[01:23:41.986 --> 01:23:50.190]  Well, on that subject, where they pose our saviors, these terror drills in New Jersey, first off, what's interesting is that
[01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:58.965]  When the simulated bio-attack happened, half of the role-players in the drill left the contaminated area.
[01:23:59.600 --> 01:24:08.204]  Which, far from being a mistake, would probably be more useful for the people carrying out the attack, the globalists, because the disease and panic would spread throughout the country.
[01:24:08.784 --> 01:24:25.812]  And it's not going out on a limb to say they'd be behind the attack, because we've got the quote from the PNAC document, written by Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz and others, where they talk directly about using bioweapons as a political tool.
[01:24:26.112 --> 01:24:28.133]  Yeah, they say we want to legitimize their use!
[01:24:28.937 --> 01:24:30.658]  I've got the quote here.
[01:24:31.038 --> 01:24:40.704]  Quote, although it may take several decades for the process of military transformation to unfold, in time the arts of warfare will be vastly different than it is today.
[01:24:40.864 --> 01:24:52.471]  Advanced forms of biological warfare that can target specific genotypes may transform biological warfare from the realm of terror to a politically useful tool.
[01:24:53.431 --> 01:24:58.034]  We need to take that subsection and post that along with our vaccine section.
[01:24:59.375 --> 01:25:04.099]  And who was it that was on Cipro before the anthrax attack?
[01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:08.123]  The Bush cabinet, yeah.
[01:25:08.143 --> 01:25:14.368]  While that was rolling through so the Patriot Act could be steamrolled as they kept up the fear levels after 9-11.
[01:25:14.408 --> 01:25:17.631]  You know, people aren't talking about the Terry
[01:25:19.165 --> 01:25:24.088]  Well, yeah, but it'll come up again in a week or so when the autopsy information gets released.
[01:25:36.843 --> 01:25:50.811]  The only thing about it now is this Talking Points memo they've unearthed, where Republicans discuss how to exploit the story for political purposes, which then energizes the pro-death crowd to think that they were right all along.
[01:25:51.491 --> 01:25:58.676]  The fact is, at no point were Congress, Jeb Bush or George Bush, interested in saving her life.
[01:25:59.356 --> 01:26:02.838]  You know, we're talking about George Bush... No, they wanted to use it as a political football!
[01:26:04.102 --> 01:26:05.163]  Well, yeah, on one level.
[01:26:05.923 --> 01:26:07.704]  But that doesn't mean it's right to kill our folks.
[01:26:07.724 --> 01:26:10.325]  It's because they were doing it for a bad reason.
[01:26:11.265 --> 01:26:17.328]  Well, I mean, George Bush is the guy who oversaw 152 executions while governor of Texas.
[01:26:17.608 --> 01:26:28.513]  And you've mentioned many times the quote out of Time Magazine where he mocks the woman on death row, Carla Faye Tucker, who... Well, he also had a law passed where they pull people's tubes every day in Texas.
[01:26:28.733 --> 01:26:30.654]  You run out of money, the state kills you.
[01:26:32.154 --> 01:26:39.376]  So, when Bush talks about encouraging a culture of life after he just killed 100,000 Iraqis, it starts to sound a bit hypocritical.
[01:26:39.836 --> 01:26:44.597]  So people on the left see that and say, you know, well if that's pro-life, I want nothing to do with it.
[01:26:45.437 --> 01:26:56.600]  And the very argument that this sets the precedent for government intrusion into private family affairs, which even split some of your audience, judging from the emails I received,
[01:26:57.319 --> 01:27:01.343]  It's new, because there was never any motivation to stop her from dying.
[01:27:01.683 --> 01:27:07.688]  Yeah, what they do is, they take a case point example and then inject that into the rest of the debate.
[01:27:08.208 --> 01:27:15.554]  Folks, we're not saying people, if they want to, don't have a right to, you know, not be given a bunch of aid and medical care.
[01:27:15.935 --> 01:27:19.598]  Terri was clearly involved in foul play, what happened to her.
[01:27:20.118 --> 01:27:25.663]  Clearly he told the jury in the Sybil trial that he wanted this money to take care of her, that she wanted to live.
[01:27:26.264 --> 01:27:35.352]  After he got the money, then he said she wanted to die, and he locked her up in a room for ten years without any sunshine, with the blinds closed, not letting them brush her teeth!
[01:27:35.752 --> 01:27:37.253]  That poor young lady was tortured!
[01:27:38.815 --> 01:27:43.639]  Yeah, by a method even banned by the Geneva Convention as a war crime.
[01:27:44.170 --> 01:27:54.453]  But you don't hear the people decrying government encroachment in this case, you know, complaining about new freedom, for example, which is total government encroachment across the board.
[01:27:54.513 --> 01:27:55.193]  And it's federal!
[01:27:55.273 --> 01:27:57.293]  Federalized forced psychological testing!
[01:27:58.334 --> 01:28:01.995]  Yeah, and so then you've got the media overwhelmingly pro-death.
[01:28:02.975 --> 01:28:11.697]  The British media, up until just before the case was highlighted again three weeks ago, was still reporting that she was in a coma
[01:28:12.438 --> 01:28:18.261]  And only corrected it when people complained, and some Associated Press Voices journalists are still reporting that.
[01:28:19.542 --> 01:28:24.645]  And the bias is proven by the polls, which, as you just mentioned, all the foul play, people aren't educated about it.
[01:28:25.085 --> 01:28:31.589]  So the polls before she died were loaded questions, which took... We've got a woman who's a vegetable!
[01:28:32.269 --> 01:28:33.650]  She said she wanted to die!
[01:28:34.050 --> 01:28:35.731]  Should we take her off life support?
[01:28:36.111 --> 01:28:37.832]  All three of those statements are a lie!
[01:28:38.733 --> 01:28:39.533]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:40.114 --> 01:28:40.574]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.300 --> 01:28:46.321]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.201 --> 01:28:50.002]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.084 --> 01:28:56.805]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[01:28:57.065 --> 01:29:01.366]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[01:29:01.607 --> 01:29:08.529]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[01:29:08.909 --> 01:29:15.573]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[01:29:15.873 --> 01:29:19.335]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWox Citrus Concentrate.
[01:29:19.355 --> 01:29:20.136]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioWox.com.
[01:29:24.458 --> 01:29:31.600]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason Bio-Ox International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate.
[01:29:31.681 --> 01:29:38.383]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:43.264]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit Bio-Ox.com.
[01:29:43.444 --> 01:29:45.965]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[01:29:46.125 --> 01:29:50.787]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use the Bio-Ox family of products.
[01:29:53.092 --> 01:29:58.056]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[01:29:58.356 --> 01:30:03.800]  Ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.123]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:30:08.464 --> 01:30:11.506]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:11.806 --> 01:30:15.229]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:30:15.569 --> 01:30:24.917]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:25.177 --> 01:30:28.680]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:36.006]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[01:30:36.266 --> 01:30:38.489]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.

[01:30:54.497 --> 01:30:59.981]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:04.644]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:04.884 --> 01:31:11.849]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.

[01:31:41.564 --> 01:31:45.787]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:45.827 --> 01:31:47.508]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:07.927 --> 01:32:11.549]  All your highness will discuss the location of your hidden rebel base.
[01:32:12.510 --> 01:32:13.990]  That's pretty good voice over, huh folks?
[01:32:14.631 --> 01:32:15.291]  I can do other ones.
[01:32:15.971 --> 01:32:17.052]  I can do Marvin the Martian.
[01:32:17.752 --> 01:32:21.414]  Trying to have some fun in the middle of all this horrible stuff that's going on.
[01:32:22.415 --> 01:32:30.439]  Speaking of our highness, our friend from the United Kingdom, Paul, I want to go to these loaded phone lines, 1-800-259-9231, but I set out error.
[01:32:30.459 --> 01:32:31.720]  This is from a long kiss goodnight.
[01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:39.413]  I've literally got like five movies that talk about blowing up the World Trade Center.
[01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:43.978]  One of them where they want to fly hijacked jets into the World Trade Center to get martial law.
[01:32:44.018 --> 01:32:44.718]  The government does.
[01:32:45.219 --> 01:32:49.343]  But we'll just play this one in the interest of time, talking about flaunting it in our face.
[01:32:50.144 --> 01:32:51.986]  And I forget the name of this black actor.
[01:32:52.026 --> 01:32:53.767]  I really like the actor, but I forget his name.
[01:32:53.787 --> 01:32:54.368]  What's his name, Paul?
[01:32:57.720 --> 01:32:58.740]  Samuel L. Jackson.
[01:32:59.521 --> 01:33:00.322]  Samuel L. Jackson.
[01:33:00.842 --> 01:33:08.248]  So here's the government CIA guy explaining why he's going to blow up the World Trade Center and how they tried to do it before, but how they failed.
[01:33:08.288 --> 01:33:09.629]  And that part's even true!
[01:33:10.250 --> 01:33:11.291]  This was made in, what, 1997?
[01:33:11.371 --> 01:33:17.636]  It's somewhere in the labyrinthine galleries of PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:17.936 --> 01:33:19.057]  But here it is, folks.
[01:33:19.858 --> 01:33:22.420]  Fundraiser?
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:22.420]  1993.
[01:33:23.961 --> 01:33:25.462]  World Trade Center bombing.
[01:33:25.683 --> 01:33:25.943]  Remember?
[01:33:28.351 --> 01:33:32.253]  During the trial, one of the bombers claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.
[01:33:35.676 --> 01:33:38.657]  The diplomat who issued the terrorist visa was CIA.
[01:33:39.578 --> 01:33:44.861]  It's not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing, purely to justify a budget increase.
[01:33:45.442 --> 01:33:49.984]  You're telling me that you're going to fake some terrorist thing just to get some money out of Congress?
[01:33:50.044 --> 01:33:54.287]  Well, unfortunately, Mr. Hennessy, I have no idea how to fake killing 4,000 people.
[01:33:55.748 --> 01:33:57.329]  So we're just going to have to do it for real.
[01:33:59.123 --> 01:34:00.624]  Oh, blame it on the Muslims, naturally.
[01:34:01.204 --> 01:34:03.024]  That I get my funding.
[01:34:04.305 --> 01:34:04.985]  Good night, old girl.
[01:34:06.845 --> 01:34:08.326]  Timothy, I'll be in chopper one.
[01:34:10.267 --> 01:34:12.547]  Timothy, I'll be in chopper one.
[01:34:13.588 --> 01:34:15.128]  And, uh, Paul, I got a CNN article.
[01:34:15.248 --> 01:34:16.408]  Big brother, big money.
[01:34:16.648 --> 01:34:23.411]  Why, the whole economy's shifting over, not just to prisons, already the biggest part, Paul, over to surveillance and control, and we're all gonna be under it.
[01:34:23.691 --> 01:34:24.751]  Why, terrorism is
[01:34:25.789 --> 01:34:29.132]  Is not paying a $35 parking ticket or late library books?
[01:34:29.153 --> 01:34:29.873]  They're going to use it all.
[01:34:29.973 --> 01:34:30.874]  Sounds good, doesn't it, Paul?
[01:34:31.595 --> 01:34:32.095]  Well, yeah.
[01:34:32.576 --> 01:34:35.519]  The point I want to make about the movies...
[01:34:36.383 --> 01:34:42.544]  Is that we've got a bit of a problem, because for the past three years, the movies about 9-11 have been in production.
[01:34:43.164 --> 01:34:55.987]  So when they come out, obviously they're going to follow the government version of events down to a T. And for most people who don't even read the newspapers or watch television news, that for them is going to be the official version of events.
[01:34:56.027 --> 01:34:58.147]  Oh yeah, lots of Hollywood movies now, yeah.
[01:34:58.607 --> 01:35:01.028]  Yeah, scripted by people like Lionel Chetwin, so...
[01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:08.262]  Who openly threatened me and said they were going to get me in a Hollywood bathroom before I went and debated him on national TV.
[01:35:09.382 --> 01:35:15.564]  Yes, I mean most people now get their historical accounts of historical events from Hollywood.
[01:35:15.584 --> 01:35:19.106]  From the president's chairman on the media council who threatened me in a bathroom.
[01:35:19.806 --> 01:35:26.048]  Because these Hollywood producers to get permission to use air force bases and these kinds of facilities
[01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:30.643]  To film their movies and give them a real-life effect, they have to get government permission.
[01:35:30.663 --> 01:35:33.524]  They're a bunch of gangster scum.
[01:35:34.304 --> 01:35:39.746]  Yeah, that means government involvement in script writing, advising, Homeland Security advising.
[01:35:39.806 --> 01:35:45.369]  And what, Paul, I wrote an article for Prison Planet, I mean, three years ago about this, and I'm not tooting my horn, folks.
[01:35:46.429 --> 01:35:49.250]  Again, the tip of the iceberg is Armstrong Williams.
[01:35:51.411 --> 01:35:52.111]  It's a lot worse.
[01:35:52.451 --> 01:35:55.773]  Because, as you pointed out, whereas before it was all about
[01:35:56.863 --> 01:36:01.685]  Product placement, like the Nokia adverts in the Matrix and so forth.
[01:36:01.765 --> 01:36:04.446]  Now it's about propaganda placement.
[01:36:05.107 --> 01:36:20.054]  And that's a problem we'll have in the next year or so when all these 9-11 movies come out because the government's been so discredited about their official version that these Hollywood scripts will in a sense back them up because that's all the majority of people watch.
[01:36:20.174 --> 01:36:25.156]  And before we take any more calls, you posted an AP article two days ago and also wrote some good analysis about it.
[01:36:25.876 --> 01:36:26.096]  Well,
[01:36:52.418 --> 01:37:08.066]  You've got photos that you can compare between the Windsor Building in Madrid, which burned for nearly two days on almost all its floors, and the World Trade Center, the core of those two buildings, the structural core.
[01:37:08.146 --> 01:37:08.966]  Compare the two.
[01:37:09.407 --> 01:37:12.368]  The World Trade Center is obviously a lot stronger.
[01:37:12.748 --> 01:37:13.909]  Little smoldering red fires.
[01:37:16.775 --> 01:37:24.368]  Yeah, and then the firefighter tapes themselves, which clearly indicate that the fires were minimal and under control right before the towers collapsed.
[01:37:24.955 --> 01:37:42.160]  So, it's the third or fourth explanation as to why the towers fell after the jet fuel melting the steel, which has proven impossible, and then the pancake effect which crushed one floor after another, that was proven impossible because the core of the building was designed to prevent that.
[01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:47.241]  So now the fireproofing was faulty, so that caused the collapse, apparently.
[01:37:48.018 --> 01:37:53.500]  In the face of all this evidence of eyewitnesses saying bombs going off as well, and the fact that they haven't... And get back!
[01:37:53.540 --> 01:37:54.360]  We're going to bring down 7!
[01:37:54.801 --> 01:37:55.321]  Get back!
[01:37:57.782 --> 01:38:02.763]  So, I mean, it's... I can't see it working because, again, it's like the Silverstein thing.
[01:38:02.803 --> 01:38:09.186]  Type in Silverstein into Google and the first results you'll get are about how he and the others blew up Building 7.
[01:38:09.246 --> 01:38:11.186]  So it's not working.
[01:38:11.246 --> 01:38:12.507]  It's not having the effect they want.
[01:38:13.143 --> 01:38:19.425]  And they can't just get rid of us, even though we're the people that broke it, because there's thousands of websites!
[01:38:20.326 --> 01:38:35.231]  Exactly, so they then contract their minions in the media, Popular Mechanics, to come out and do a demonization piece where they set up a strawman argument which contains barely any of the allegations that we level against them, and destroys all the
[01:38:37.037 --> 01:38:48.920]  Nebulous conspiracies like, you know, holograms as planes and pods, which there is some evidence that leans towards that, but it's by no means concrete, the concrete stuff that we can prove.
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:50.761]  And then they attack that.
[01:38:50.861 --> 01:38:59.584]  So, I mean, it shows their desperation that they're having to try and seriously attack it rather than pass it off as crackpot conspiracy theories.
[01:38:59.644 --> 01:39:01.824]  What's the Gandhi quote you like to give?
[01:39:03.785 --> 01:39:04.445]  It's something like,
[01:39:05.603 --> 01:39:10.187]  First they ridicule us, then they ignore us, then they attack us, then we win.
[01:39:12.229 --> 01:39:17.613]  No, first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:39:18.454 --> 01:39:20.495]  Yes, I mean, we're winning.
[01:39:20.535 --> 01:39:21.096]  That's the point.
[01:39:21.116 --> 01:39:26.400]  The Zogby poll proved that back six months ago.
[01:39:28.162 --> 01:39:30.424]  We're winning, and you can run but you can't hide.
[01:39:31.983 --> 01:39:39.970]  I had this Pentagon minion on this rider yesterday about how we need a draft and he's like well yeah there's another terror attack that's all we'll get our draft.
[01:39:41.592 --> 01:39:44.995]  I mean it's just so we haven't won this thing yet folks.
[01:39:45.535 --> 01:39:51.541]  The fact is we've backed them off for approaching four years from carrying out anything any kind of major attack.
[01:39:52.324 --> 01:40:07.413]  So that in itself is a benchmark on our progress by the fact that we've blown the whistle on the criminals to such a loud extent that they're frightened of doing anything more before they have lockdown on everything in the internet and the media, which is what they're trying to do.
[01:40:08.214 --> 01:40:11.716]  Oh yeah, the new thing with San Francisco, they were voting on it two days ago.
[01:40:12.056 --> 01:40:16.959]  Have you found out if they passed a law restricting and regulating websites, free speech?
[01:40:18.190 --> 01:40:35.917]  I haven't heard anything more on that but it was labelled as restricting blogging and blogging is a new word so basically they can define it as any kind of news website to restrict it to have government approval to write it like a newspaper would be.
[01:40:37.609 --> 01:40:39.670]  They're attempting that in San Francisco.
[01:40:40.130 --> 01:40:47.652]  FBI have just requested the server logs of several alternative websites so they can see who's visiting them.
[01:40:48.132 --> 01:40:49.733]  Trying to shut those down as well.
[01:40:50.733 --> 01:40:56.435]  And then with the taxation on the email, so people can't mass email political news groups.
[01:40:56.995 --> 01:41:02.737]  But it's like... I mean, it's like a big fat hog trying to drink up all the water in Lake Superior.
[01:41:03.137 --> 01:41:04.137]  They're not going to be able to do it.
[01:41:04.958 --> 01:41:05.838]  Well, exactly, because
[01:41:06.618 --> 01:41:14.280]  The structure of the internet is set up so there are so many fail-safes that if they knock one node down, then another just comes and replaces it.
[01:41:14.600 --> 01:41:16.880]  Their own control grid is blowing up in their face.
[01:41:18.321 --> 01:41:22.782]  It's a mammoth task and it's probably too late in the day for them to do anything about it now.
[01:41:24.362 --> 01:41:27.223]  Only fear can try to keep us in line.
[01:41:27.243 --> 01:41:27.903]  I don't think it's going to work.
[01:41:27.923 --> 01:41:28.823]  Let's go to calls here.
[01:41:28.863 --> 01:41:32.124]  Chris in Kentucky, then Steve, Brett, Brian, Mike and others.
[01:41:32.164 --> 01:41:33.104]  Go ahead, Chris.
[01:41:33.886 --> 01:41:34.807]  Hey Alex, thank you.
[01:41:35.487 --> 01:41:39.490]  This past weekend, there was something I was out and saw that they're doing.
[01:41:39.830 --> 01:41:43.532]  You know, you've heard about these drills going on with the police, but I believe this is what they were doing.
[01:41:44.573 --> 01:41:52.138]  I was out watching these six police cars pull up, and they kind of blocked off a section of the park, and they told everybody to check and get their IDs out.
[01:41:52.568 --> 01:41:53.829]  And they wouldn't let anybody leave.
[01:41:53.889 --> 01:41:55.430]  Anybody they tried to would be stopped.
[01:41:55.470 --> 01:41:56.410]  Like, get out of the car.
[01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:58.592]  And I've seen people be put into these cruisers.
[01:41:58.612 --> 01:42:02.834]  I mean, in question, there were a lot of people there with angered looks on their face.
[01:42:03.275 --> 01:42:06.236]  This has got to be these federal drills that they're proposing or something.
[01:42:06.637 --> 01:42:10.219]  Well, I mean, sometimes the police might have been looking for somebody, but generally it's not.
[01:42:10.259 --> 01:42:11.460]  It's just part of sweeps.
[01:42:12.340 --> 01:42:16.083]  And then this is how it is in totalitarian countries, where they just say, Alright!
[01:42:16.643 --> 01:42:17.303]  It's a sweep!
[01:42:17.443 --> 01:42:18.284]  Everybody line up!
[01:42:18.999 --> 01:42:19.759]  Yes, sir.
[01:42:20.219 --> 01:42:22.300]  My papers, please, sir.
[01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.160]  And, uh, yeah, but the border's wide open.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:26.901]  Yeah, that's exactly what I was going to point out.
[01:42:26.921 --> 01:42:27.761]  The border's wide open.
[01:42:28.081 --> 01:42:33.882]  Also, on the news locally here, yesterday, they also talked about the, uh, microchips for pets in the databases.
[01:42:33.942 --> 01:42:34.943]  It's all in the news.
[01:42:34.963 --> 01:42:37.763]  They just had a local one here, and people are saying how good it is.
[01:42:37.863 --> 01:42:40.884]  Every week I see a story how they saved a lost puppy with it.
[01:42:42.744 --> 01:42:44.805]  Our children need it, Sean Hannity says.
[01:42:45.487 --> 01:42:48.029]  Yeah, as John Haney says, we need it, and we all need it.
[01:42:48.069 --> 01:42:50.651]  The disconditioning is that they're going to do it.
[01:42:51.091 --> 01:42:53.874]  Most people start fighting the system now.
[01:42:54.454 --> 01:42:55.455]  That's the only way you're going to do it.
[01:42:55.855 --> 01:43:00.219]  You get out there and start getting active, and get involved with everybody, and get these films and make copies.
[01:43:00.239 --> 01:43:00.999]  And that's what I'm doing right now.
[01:43:01.019 --> 01:43:12.568]  And tell your city and state, no, you're not going to put transponders in our cars, attack us on dull roads, and no, you're not going to have license plate scanning cameras, which they've already put in, but now they're going to use them to arrest you if you haven't paid your parking tickets.
[01:43:13.049 --> 01:43:13.489]  Exactly.
[01:43:13.985 --> 01:43:19.247]  And then if you park in the wrong spot, well, let your policeman take it and take it to a chop shop.
[01:43:20.307 --> 01:43:21.067]  That's what's going to happen.
[01:43:22.048 --> 01:43:25.429]  Well, they certainly are going to tow them and charge you hundreds of dollars, but yeah, in D.C.
[01:43:25.449 --> 01:43:26.269]  they do steal cars.
[01:43:26.969 --> 01:43:27.609]  Thanks for the call.
[01:43:27.629 --> 01:43:28.430]  Really good points.
[01:43:29.250 --> 01:43:31.691]  Let's talk to Steve in Kansas.
[01:43:32.431 --> 01:43:33.111]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:43:33.871 --> 01:43:34.672]  Oh, how you doing, Alex?
[01:43:34.772 --> 01:43:35.112]  Good, sir.
[01:43:35.992 --> 01:43:41.234]  Well, yesterday a person called and said that they needed some information on how to get the
[01:43:43.562 --> 01:43:44.503]  Uh, Patriot Act?
[01:43:46.844 --> 01:43:47.144]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:47.184 --> 01:43:47.524]  Copy.
[01:43:48.324 --> 01:43:51.106]  Uh, government dot printing offices.
[01:43:52.086 --> 01:43:57.269]  And the toll-free number is 1-866-512-1800.
[01:43:57.369 --> 01:44:05.713]  Well, thanks for giving out that info, but the caller was saying he couldn't find the Patriot Act on my... Yeah, he couldn't find it.
[01:44:05.753 --> 01:44:06.794]  This is a hard copy.
[01:44:06.834 --> 01:44:07.274]  It cost you $10.
[01:44:07.314 --> 01:44:09.495]  Yeah, I mean, sir...
[01:44:10.645 --> 01:44:13.247]  It's really hard to not be able to find it on the web.
[01:44:13.267 --> 01:44:15.269]  Oh, you can find it anywhere.
[01:44:15.349 --> 01:44:16.290]  All you have to do is look.
[01:44:16.710 --> 01:44:18.111]  You just type in HR 3162.
[01:44:18.431 --> 01:44:18.792]  Yep.
[01:44:19.773 --> 01:44:24.476]  Or you go to Infowars.com and you put the search engine text of Patriot Act 1 or 2.
[01:44:24.556 --> 01:44:24.836]  Right.
[01:44:25.597 --> 01:44:27.639]  And it'll save there and it'll pop up.
[01:44:28.239 --> 01:44:29.100]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:44:29.620 --> 01:44:36.846]  And I was going to get on the phone and go, Comrade, I do not you understand that you cannot eat us.
[01:44:40.244 --> 01:44:47.310]  That was part of your, you know, adding humor to this absolutely crazy world.
[01:44:48.231 --> 01:44:49.672]  But you're doing a great job, man.
[01:44:49.752 --> 01:44:52.014]  I did order a Berkey light yesterday.
[01:44:52.034 --> 01:44:53.135]  Oh, thank you!
[01:44:53.155 --> 01:44:58.679]  I mean, Debbie is such a nice lady.
[01:45:00.441 --> 01:45:02.302]  Well, I mean, they're high quality filters.
[01:45:02.422 --> 01:45:02.903]  I use them.
[01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:03.764]  I've given them as gifts.
[01:45:03.784 --> 01:45:04.804]  They're made in America.
[01:45:05.645 --> 01:45:07.747]  And, well, thank you, sir, for ordering your Berkey.
[01:45:08.217 --> 01:45:17.600]  Well, I have six or seven of your videos, and I'm going to get two more in a couple weeks.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:22.642]  I'm going to try to call in tomorrow and let you know what's going on with me and my daughter.
[01:45:22.662 --> 01:45:25.542]  I called you about nine months ago going through the custody thing.
[01:45:25.562 --> 01:45:26.283]  I broke my leg.
[01:45:26.323 --> 01:45:31.304]  I don't remember, but it all went south.
[01:45:31.404 --> 01:45:33.645]  I think I remember your wife was angry that you
[01:45:34.446 --> 01:45:38.149]  And she was trying to use it as a basis to get custody that you believe in a new world order?
[01:45:38.629 --> 01:45:41.832]  Yeah, and she has temporary custody now.
[01:45:43.073 --> 01:45:56.803]  Because I'm a gun toter, and I believe in crazy government things, and the judge says that I may be a dangerous person to be around.
[01:45:58.809 --> 01:46:02.410]  So your wife said, he reads news articles!
[01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:04.490]  And the judge said, my goodness!
[01:46:05.430 --> 01:46:07.951]  My goodness, that's a sign of Al-Cieda!
[01:46:08.391 --> 01:46:10.351]  Thanks for the call, my friend, and thanks for your support.
[01:46:11.212 --> 01:46:11.892]  Sorry to hear that.
[01:46:12.592 --> 01:46:15.052]  Paul, we see more and more of this.
[01:46:15.192 --> 01:46:18.833]  In the media, it's just evil to talk about freedom to be into freedom.
[01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:27.135]  Well, yeah, you remember there was that Harvard symposium a couple of years back, which affiliated anyone who professed
[01:46:27.978 --> 01:46:33.122]  Belief in a New World Order as being equated with Al-Qaeda.
[01:46:34.703 --> 01:46:36.004]  That was in the Harvard Gazette.
[01:46:36.624 --> 01:46:50.774]  And you can go right back to those pamphlets, I believe, that Arizona Police received, where anybody who frequently mentioned the Constitution, several other definitions of lone individuals, were potential terrorists.
[01:46:50.834 --> 01:46:53.196]  And in the other manual, homeschooling.
[01:46:54.210 --> 01:46:54.450]  Yeah.
[01:46:54.650 --> 01:46:59.692]  Then they'd have the drills where they simulate homeschoolers slaughtering everyone.
[01:47:01.333 --> 01:47:08.975]  Which is mind control, you know, splattering fake blood on the elementary students, telling them, you know, people stomping around in black masks, I'm a homeschooler, I don't like you!
[01:47:09.175 --> 01:47:11.056]  Those children learn, homeschoolers are bad!
[01:47:11.616 --> 01:47:12.497]  They come and hurt me!
[01:47:13.317 --> 01:47:15.898]  And they're framing American citizens for terrorism.
[01:47:16.218 --> 01:47:18.759]  Well that's classic Soviet re-education.
[01:47:20.143 --> 01:47:26.307]  I mean, taking 200 elementary students out in the parking lot and having them get on the buses and have men run around going, I'M A HOMESCHOOLER!
[01:47:26.727 --> 01:47:29.048]  FROM HOMESCHOOLERS AGAINST PUBLIC EDUCATION!
[01:47:29.108 --> 01:47:29.929]  I'M GOING TO KILL YOU!
[01:47:29.949 --> 01:47:34.852]  And then having the kids flop around with fake arms and fake guts and blood all over them?
[01:47:34.872 --> 01:47:36.152]  That's mainstream news, folks!
[01:47:36.533 --> 01:47:38.774]  I mean, think of the mind control of that, Paul!
[01:47:40.195 --> 01:47:40.775]  It's frightening.
[01:47:41.756 --> 01:47:43.256]  Nicole mentioned the Patriot Act.
[01:47:44.077 --> 01:47:47.999]  First they tried to deny it, but now Gonzales had to admit it.
[01:47:48.580 --> 01:47:49.140]  But, um...
[01:47:49.992 --> 01:48:00.701]  They had gained secret entry into the home of this Brandon Mayfield, an American citizen, for the purpose of framing him for involvement in the Madrid train bombing.
[01:48:01.461 --> 01:48:06.665]  They got his fingerprints and tried to match them up with those involved in the Madrid train bombing.
[01:48:07.046 --> 01:48:13.831]  Turned out it was a total frame-up, and that's still going on, so... At first the media claimed, oh no, that's not true, but now they have to admit it.
[01:48:15.057 --> 01:48:24.120]  Yeah, I mean they claim they weren't using the Patriot Act against American citizens and they're using it against school pranksters now and people like this.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:24.660]  What was it?
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:28.582]  Over a hundred secret searches using that.
[01:48:29.442 --> 01:48:31.082]  Well that's just what they tell us about.
[01:48:31.743 --> 01:48:32.943]  That's just what they tell us about.
[01:48:32.963 --> 01:48:35.544]  They're using 213 everywhere.
[01:48:35.784 --> 01:48:36.624]  Section 213.
[01:48:37.525 --> 01:48:41.646]  Exactly, I mean these are the ones that get in the media so God knows what else they're doing.
[01:48:43.223 --> 01:48:44.023]  It's unbelievable.
[01:48:44.304 --> 01:48:48.866]  Of course, Ashcroft told us there was no new Patriot Act, months after it was introduced by him.
[01:48:48.886 --> 01:48:52.508]  I mean, he's as bad as the Iraqi Information Minister.
[01:48:52.528 --> 01:48:53.108]  Remember that guy?
[01:48:55.189 --> 01:48:57.230]  The American troops are not in Baghdad.
[01:48:57.250 --> 01:48:59.551]  There are, like, explosions behind him and tanks.
[01:49:02.413 --> 01:49:03.133]  I don't know, Paul.
[01:49:03.193 --> 01:49:04.194]  It's just so crazy now.
[01:49:06.061 --> 01:49:08.902]  There's so much other news I want to go over here, but I want to continue with some phone calls.
[01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:11.743]  But the next hour, there are a bunch of other issues we need to go over.
[01:49:12.243 --> 01:49:16.484]  How about the Des Moines Register responding to the Jeff Gannon, Izzy Johnny, Gosh story?
[01:49:17.384 --> 01:49:22.686]  And I also want to get into Iraqi suspects as U.S.
[01:49:22.706 --> 01:49:24.186]  troops took mother hostage.
[01:49:24.546 --> 01:49:27.327]  And they admit, yes, we take people's families hostage, Paul.
[01:49:28.067 --> 01:49:29.147]  That's P-O-O-G.
[01:49:30.128 --> 01:49:30.728]  That's freedom.
[01:49:32.328 --> 01:49:34.249]  Because the good guys take people hostage, right?
[01:49:34.929 --> 01:49:35.369]  Exactly.
[01:49:36.127 --> 01:49:38.349]  And all the Iraqi police are wearing black ski masks.
[01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:40.070]  Well, they do that here, I mean.
[01:49:40.090 --> 01:49:41.011]  Military fatigues.
[01:49:41.071 --> 01:49:41.472]  Pardon me?
[01:49:42.092 --> 01:49:43.493]  And military fatigues as well.
[01:49:43.513 --> 01:49:44.894]  It's the militarized police force.
[01:49:45.355 --> 01:49:47.296]  Well, that's what keeps you safe, Paul.
[01:49:47.717 --> 01:49:48.598]  That's liberation.
[01:49:49.098 --> 01:49:50.139]  Liberation, we'll be back.
[01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:54.702]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:54.882 --> 01:49:57.986]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.106 --> 01:50:02.010]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:06.295]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:06.635 --> 01:50:10.420]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:12.362]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.942 --> 01:50:15.864]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:50:15.904 --> 01:50:20.607]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:20.767 --> 01:50:23.809]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:23.989 --> 01:50:26.851]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.331 --> 01:50:33.455]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:33.995 --> 01:50:37.778]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:51:09.426 --> 01:51:13.648]  Cysts, parasites and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:13.929 --> 01:51:17.871]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:51:18.091 --> 01:51:24.615]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:51:24.835 --> 01:51:30.318]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:57.251]  Marshall Law 9-11, the Rhodes Charity.
[01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:05.771]  All of my films are excellent.
[01:53:05.791 --> 01:53:06.571]  You need to have them.
[01:53:06.591 --> 01:53:08.192]  But Martial Law is my newest.
[01:53:10.113 --> 01:53:14.036]  And this film will not be seen.
[01:53:14.176 --> 01:53:15.356]  It will not have an effect.
[01:53:15.416 --> 01:53:18.358]  It will not wake people up unless you get it and make copies.
[01:53:18.478 --> 01:53:19.599]  I authorize you to.
[01:53:19.719 --> 01:53:20.559]  I want you to.
[01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:25.162]  The DVD is now out.
[01:53:27.363 --> 01:53:29.384]  And it's over 3 hours long.
[01:53:29.604 --> 01:53:32.186]  It's like 3 hours and 30 something seconds long.
[01:53:33.638 --> 01:53:35.759]  You need to have this film.
[01:53:37.520 --> 01:53:40.681]  And Paul, you've had a chance to watch it online.
[01:53:40.761 --> 01:53:44.323]  I'm yet to mail you a copy over across the pond.
[01:53:44.363 --> 01:53:46.263]  You need to call my office and ask for one.
[01:53:47.044 --> 01:53:50.065]  But just your plug for Martial Law.
[01:53:51.226 --> 01:53:56.488]  Well yeah, it's split up into three segments, which makes it for easy viewing.
[01:53:58.058 --> 01:54:16.395]  You focus on the police state in New York for the convention, the surveillance blimps, then you move on to 9-11 and you're actually there on Ground Zero showing the physical relationship between where the Twin Towers were and where Building 7 was and where they're constructing the new one.
[01:54:16.975 --> 01:54:29.218]  Making the point that the lie that the World Trade Center 7 was affected by flying debris or whatever explanation they give is simply not possible for its collapse.
[01:54:29.478 --> 01:54:43.941]  And then you go into the more eclectic aspects of the New World Order in the last segment, the occult relationship, the Nazi ties of the Bushes, Schwarzenegger and how they're gearing him for presidency.
[01:54:44.972 --> 01:54:46.854]  So it's split up into three segments.
[01:54:46.914 --> 01:54:52.899]  It's well defined and I think from having seen all the others that it's your best work to date.
[01:54:53.760 --> 01:54:55.121]  Well I just want it to be seen.
[01:54:55.241 --> 01:54:59.885]  So folks go to prisonplanet.tv and get a monthly subscription.
[01:54:59.905 --> 01:55:00.425]  15 cents a day.

[01:55:36.266 --> 01:55:36.326]  1-888-253-3139
[01:55:41.727 --> 01:55:43.128]  Thanks for taking the call, Alex.
[01:55:43.148 --> 01:55:43.368]  You bet.
[01:56:12.272 --> 01:56:15.976]  I'm very impressed with the way it's organized and it is well thought out.
[01:56:16.036 --> 01:56:19.959]  Their approach is very intelligent and I just wanted to get your all's opinion.
[01:56:20.540 --> 01:56:28.167]  Considering the level of criminal that we're dealing with in the White House, do you think or do you anticipate a possible frame-up?
[01:56:28.767 --> 01:56:31.430]  You know, example, murdering some immigrants?
[01:56:31.946 --> 01:56:34.908]  Are some illegal aliens coming across the border and trying to frame these people?
[01:56:34.968 --> 01:56:38.169]  Or do you think it's built enough steam that they could not get away with something like that?
[01:56:38.589 --> 01:56:43.412]  You know, bottom line, the globalists have already tried to pull stuff like that in Texas with Ranch Rescue.
[01:56:43.432 --> 01:56:46.513]  You know, beat somebody up, or claim they were beat up, and it turned out it was a lie.
[01:56:46.533 --> 01:56:51.496]  There's a French news crew there covering the lie they tried to put forward.
[01:56:52.676 --> 01:56:58.099]  But, really, I think they're going to try to ignore it at this point, and hope it goes away, but it's not going away.
[01:56:58.399 --> 01:56:58.619]  Right.
[01:56:58.860 --> 01:57:01.501]  Well, I remembered Casey Nethercott being on your show.
[01:57:02.288 --> 01:57:07.810]  And I remember him saying that I believe he was held for 29 days or something like that without any charges.
[01:57:08.190 --> 01:57:09.110]  Yeah, that's what they do.
[01:57:09.130 --> 01:57:11.671]  I mean, and the globalists know there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[01:57:12.411 --> 01:57:14.212]  So they think they're going to be able to pull something else.
[01:57:14.472 --> 01:57:21.174]  And I remember him stating that an FBI agent looked directly at him and told him that they would fabricate a case against him.
[01:57:21.554 --> 01:57:22.754]  Yeah, no, that's the new freedom.
[01:57:22.994 --> 01:57:25.675]  And, uh, so I just didn't know if you all anticipated that.
[01:57:25.715 --> 01:57:32.476]  Discussed it this morning with some co-workers and we all concluded we would not be surprised at all to see an attempt to frame these people.
[01:57:33.576 --> 01:57:36.197]  Well, it's not gonna work if there's so many video cameras and witnesses.
[01:57:36.217 --> 01:57:36.937]  That's the problem.
[01:57:37.457 --> 01:57:38.317]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:38.337 --> 01:57:39.237]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:39.257 --> 01:57:39.697]  Stay with us.
[01:57:43.198 --> 01:57:43.618]  Terror.
[01:57:49.339 --> 01:57:49.939]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.638 --> 01:57:51.698]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.418 --> 01:57:53.499]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.159 --> 01:57:54.999]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.759 --> 01:57:56.619]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.319 --> 01:58:01.220]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.500 --> 01:58:05.621]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:12.402 --> 01:58:15.843]  Hour number three in this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[01:58:15.923 --> 01:58:19.644]  Paul Watson riding shotgun with us, giving us his report from the prison planet.
[01:58:21.181 --> 01:58:25.542]  We'll be checking your calls in this hour.
[01:58:25.562 --> 01:58:25.902]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:27.362 --> 01:58:34.884]  Paul, national ID cards failed this week, what, for the third or fourth time in England, but that isn't stopping Blair from continuing to reintroduce them.
[01:58:35.284 --> 01:58:40.285]  We've gotten our national ID cards here with the driver's license, but the average person isn't even aware of that.
[01:58:40.605 --> 01:58:44.625]  Why do you think in England they admit it's a national ID card, but here they're more sneaky about it?
[01:58:45.786 --> 01:58:47.206]  Because in England there's, um,
[01:58:48.228 --> 01:58:52.012]  No history of what tyranny is defined as or freedom.
[01:58:52.673 --> 01:59:07.329]  With the ID card bill in England, the government got caught putting out fake polls whereby people phoned in and emailed into online polls and the results were covered up by the government.
[01:59:07.990 --> 01:59:23.198]  They've dropped it for now, because there's about to be an election on May 5th, but when Labour and Tony Blair win, as they're very much expected to do again for the third time in a row, they're just going to reintroduce it again, so it'll be straight back on the agenda.
[01:59:24.999 --> 01:59:36.945]  At the same time, over in Australia, they're introducing the same thing, photo ID card, with all the biometric information on it as well, tied into the driver's licenses, which is what's happening in America.
[01:59:37.631 --> 01:59:41.495]  So, point by point around the globe, they're like a spider's web.
[01:59:41.515 --> 01:59:46.379]  They're introducing the same programs at the same time as they do with most things.
[01:59:46.439 --> 01:59:52.645]  So, for the moment, it's on the back burner in England, but they're set to reintroduce it immediately after the election.
[01:59:52.725 --> 01:59:57.370]  And the so-called opposition, the Tories, are right behind it, the Conservatives.
[01:59:59.095 --> 02:00:05.180]  Both major political parties are lockstep behind it, as they are with all major issues, including the war.
[02:00:05.440 --> 02:00:12.926]  Well, just like here, with the war and the rest of it, but then they have little fake fights in your Parliament and on our Congress.
[02:00:14.187 --> 02:00:23.535]  Yeah, and the little fights are always about issues which don't really matter, to give the assumption that they're actually in opposition to each other, when they all meet at the Bilderberg meeting once a year anyway.
[02:00:25.345 --> 02:00:30.268]  Coming up after some calls, Iraqis suggest and suspects say U.S.
[02:00:30.368 --> 02:00:31.829]  troops took Mother hostage.
[02:00:32.210 --> 02:00:36.212]  Norwegian government forces 40% female employment or businesses get shut down.
[02:00:36.793 --> 02:00:38.274]  That's the new freedom.
[02:00:38.294 --> 02:00:42.056]  Just total tyranny, folks, but in the name of PC.
[02:00:42.576 --> 02:00:44.678]  Japanese town gets a real robo-cop.
[02:00:45.098 --> 02:00:50.342]  Attorney General admits use of Patriot Act in Mayfield case that you already mentioned, but I want to get into that a little bit.
[02:00:51.696 --> 02:00:51.996]  More.
[02:00:52.577 --> 02:01:00.842]  And at the same time, Bilderberg group meeting, Bilderberg.org thinks that they found the location in Germany.
[02:01:02.003 --> 02:01:04.165]  So we'll cover that.
[02:01:04.845 --> 02:01:13.251]  And another article, speed cameras can talk to each other and track you down for the most petty of supposed, not even crimes.
[02:01:13.951 --> 02:01:17.514]  And I want to then of course get a little bit into the pontiff.
[02:01:18.754 --> 02:01:29.544]  and his death and how they're going to bury him and tomb him during this solar eclipse and then they're trying to claim this is some type of magical thing.
[02:01:29.604 --> 02:01:34.829]  I mean folks, they're deciding when to bury him and that sounds pretty occultic to me, Paul.
[02:01:36.050 --> 02:01:42.697]  Well yeah, they're following, his name splits my mind, but it's a 10th century prophet who
[02:01:43.519 --> 02:01:52.983]  Made the prophecy that the Pope would be born, this current Pope, the one who's just died, would be born during an eclipse and would be buried on an eclipse.
[02:01:53.283 --> 02:01:57.105]  It's Saint Malachi, is that right?
[02:01:57.645 --> 02:01:58.906]  Malachi, Malachi, yeah.
[02:01:59.166 --> 02:01:59.446]  Yeah.
[02:02:00.446 --> 02:02:06.569]  So I mean, we know that they're into this kind of stuff, so that's part of the reason why they're burying him on Friday.
[02:02:07.430 --> 02:02:15.096]  A wider debate, which is what we folks have done on the website, is whether the Pope helped or hindered the New World Order.
[02:02:15.896 --> 02:02:26.464]  Certainly in issues of pro-life, he denounced mercy killings of the elderly, unethical science and cloning, he likened abortion to the Holocaust.
[02:02:27.365 --> 02:02:31.708]  But then on the flip side, you know, he sends Bilderberg meetings and then calls for a New World Order.
[02:02:32.048 --> 02:02:34.189]  Well, they're now claiming that isn't true, that he attended.
[02:02:34.570 --> 02:02:35.370]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:35.450 --> 02:02:35.951]  Stay with us.
[02:02:36.849 --> 02:02:40.914]  On the other side, we'll take your call, so, uh, don't touch the dial.
[02:02:42.916 --> 02:02:44.318]  That's weird.
[02:02:44.959 --> 02:02:49.304]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:49.464 --> 02:02:53.709]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:56.101 --> 02:02:58.422]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:58.462 --> 02:02:59.843]  The New World Order.
[02:03:00.543 --> 02:03:01.544]  Panamera.
[02:03:01.584 --> 02:03:05.826]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:05.886 --> 02:03:12.830]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:12.930 --> 02:03:14.951]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.191 --> 02:03:25.760]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:31.344]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:03:31.825 --> 02:03:35.728]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.748 --> 02:03:36.208]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:36.288 --> 02:03:38.010]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:45.675 --> 02:03:50.176]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:50.516 --> 02:03:54.617]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:54.897 --> 02:03:55.437]  We listened.
[02:03:55.757 --> 02:04:00.738]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:04:01.018 --> 02:04:01.498]  We listened.
[02:04:01.878 --> 02:04:04.919]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:05.359 --> 02:04:05.879]  We listened.
[02:04:06.339 --> 02:04:09.360]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[02:04:09.360 --> 02:04:09.760]  I don't know.
[02:04:34.701 --> 02:04:35.583]  That's toll-free, 803-4438.
[02:04:35.623 --> 02:04:36.866]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.041 --> 02:04:50.564]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:04:50.704 --> 02:04:51.764]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:04:51.884 --> 02:04:52.765]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:04:52.885 --> 02:04:55.726]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:04:55.906 --> 02:05:00.789]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:05:01.029 --> 02:05:02.109]  Check out this new product.
[02:05:02.269 --> 02:05:05.171]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:05:05.531 --> 02:05:09.213]  I know, you're wondering, how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[02:05:09.753 --> 02:05:12.055]  The creator of No-BO understands what you're going through.
[02:05:12.135 --> 02:05:16.980]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:05:17.260 --> 02:05:20.383]  She also knows that while you want it all-natural, you want it very effective.
[02:05:20.503 --> 02:05:24.647]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually suits the skin well.
[02:05:24.667 --> 02:05:24.907]  Big Brother.
[02:05:50.735 --> 02:05:51.756]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:52.497 --> 02:05:53.597]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.258 --> 02:05:55.079]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.839 --> 02:05:56.720]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:56.740 --> 02:06:01.144]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:01.584 --> 02:06:05.667]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.777 --> 02:06:13.398]  Sing it in!
[02:06:14.018 --> 02:06:16.841]  Big Brother becomes Big Business!
[02:06:17.181 --> 02:06:18.983]  Paul Eaton loves his job.
[02:06:19.043 --> 02:06:23.066]  It takes him into people's homes and offices and allows him to film their daily lives.
[02:06:23.247 --> 02:06:33.156]  Eaton Heads, Ogilvy Field Brand Investigation, or FBI, the acronym, a division of Ogilvy and Mather, one of the world's largest advertising agencies.
[02:06:33.556 --> 02:06:38.921]  He's commissioned by companies to provide video research of consumers, providing vital insight into their likes and dislikes.
[02:06:39.481 --> 02:06:45.623]  Since launching the research unit in London five years ago, Eaton says the interest among big corporations has spiraled.
[02:06:46.043 --> 02:06:49.764]  The real bonus for clients is that they can eyeball the people who are important to them.
[02:06:50.224 --> 02:06:53.304]  This is the way we can invite a consumer into the boardroom.
[02:06:53.324 --> 02:06:57.265]  These natural social environments are natural brand environments.
[02:06:57.585 --> 02:07:00.206]  Respondents are more willing to talk truthfully about themselves.
[02:07:00.706 --> 02:07:08.028]  We're offered an opportunity of seeing them interact with brands and play with brands to which is, of course, enormously appealing.
[02:07:08.945 --> 02:07:09.626]  And what do they do?
[02:07:10.727 --> 02:07:12.488]  They pay people to put cameras in their homes.
[02:07:12.508 --> 02:07:13.709]  They put them all over the stores.
[02:07:14.190 --> 02:07:15.191]  Spying on people.
[02:07:15.571 --> 02:07:16.372]  Smart shelving.
[02:07:16.412 --> 02:07:17.893]  Listening to what they're saying and doing.
[02:07:19.114 --> 02:07:23.498]  And all of this is put into detailed psychological algorithms to study our psychology.
[02:07:23.919 --> 02:07:26.781]  And that's the problem with all these reality shows.
[02:07:27.322 --> 02:07:27.962]  It's fancy.
[02:07:28.003 --> 02:07:28.563]  It's fun.
[02:07:28.803 --> 02:07:29.664]  Shows like Big Brother.
[02:07:30.325 --> 02:07:33.828]  Having the cameras in your home gets you all conditioned to it.
[02:07:35.857 --> 02:07:38.959]  And it is very scary.
[02:07:38.999 --> 02:07:46.102]  Together with information we help retailers identify hot spots and cold spots, giving virtual information for maximizing revenue potential.
[02:07:46.683 --> 02:07:54.227]  As with existing CCTV security systems, stores are obliged to put up clearly displayed notices informing customers that they are being watched.
[02:07:54.947 --> 02:07:58.369]  But now they inform them that they're being listened to and tracked and analyzed.
[02:07:58.869 --> 02:07:59.810]  Paul, sounds fun!
[02:07:59.830 --> 02:08:04.192]  Well yeah, I mean how far away are we from the minority report?
[02:08:04.887 --> 02:08:16.239]  Whereby, you've got an RFID tag in your clothes, you walk into a Gap store, you hear a voice via the directed audio beam, which they've already got in Coke machines in Tokyo.
[02:08:16.840 --> 02:08:20.844]  You know, hello Mr. Jones, what would you like to buy today?
[02:08:20.904 --> 02:08:22.205]  We recommend this section.
[02:08:23.186 --> 02:08:26.510]  And that's the minority report, people have seen it and now with these cameras,
[02:08:28.140 --> 02:08:43.212]  They do that psychological analysis whereby they see where people are going in the shop to build up those psychological profiles, which law enforcement agencies are also using in places like train stations to identify loiterers.
[02:08:43.632 --> 02:08:53.600]  If your physical behavior betrays that of a criminal, then pre-crime dictates that you will be arrested by these intelligent cameras which predict this behavior.
[02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:55.842]  And now they're passing laws in England that are like
[02:08:58.217 --> 02:09:05.622]  Some of the Asian countries that are very, very, uh, draconian, where if you throw a piece of bubble gum on the ground, they instantly arrest you.
[02:09:05.662 --> 02:09:07.303]  No trial, no jury, no nothing.
[02:09:07.863 --> 02:09:17.289]  Well, yeah, they've hired a cadre of, um, police helpers who walk around major cities watching people, um, for dropping litter.
[02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:28.338]  If you drop a piece of bubble gum they immediately frog march you to a cash machine whereby you have to draw out the equivalent of a hundred dollars and give it to them on the spot.
[02:09:29.058 --> 02:09:35.643]  Which would certainly create a nice potential for potential thieves to do that just to get money out of people.
[02:09:37.324 --> 02:09:39.866]  And the same thing with things like the smoking.
[02:09:39.926 --> 02:09:42.748]  Drop a cigarette tab and you get the same penalty.
[02:09:43.529 --> 02:09:44.930]  People just don't challenge it.
[02:09:44.970 --> 02:09:47.732]  People who do challenge it in fact get heavier penalties.
[02:09:48.582 --> 02:09:53.283]  And they've got little signs on all the bins saying, you know, all the trash cans saying you are being monitored.
[02:09:53.303 --> 02:09:55.364]  £50 fine for dropping litter.
[02:09:56.064 --> 02:10:00.065]  So it's the new Labour Socialist Police State here in Britain.
[02:10:00.365 --> 02:10:06.187]  They even have big billboards up that show all seeing eyes looking at you going, under the watchful eyes.
[02:10:06.207 --> 02:10:06.987]  I mean, it's right out of 1994.
[02:10:08.405 --> 02:10:10.746]  Oh yeah, and they're putting cameras in all the buses.
[02:10:11.866 --> 02:10:22.488]  They're introducing pay systems where it's RFID as well for the trains in London where you wave it past the scanner which is also being used for shops in the same areas.
[02:10:22.528 --> 02:10:24.049]  Yeah, they're doing that here now too.
[02:10:25.589 --> 02:10:26.469]  It's serious.
[02:10:26.509 --> 02:10:28.450]  Here's another article and we'll go to some calls in a minute.
[02:10:28.850 --> 02:10:32.451]  Afghanistan likely to have permanent U.S.
[02:10:32.491 --> 02:10:32.931]  military.
[02:10:32.971 --> 02:10:36.572]  Now they told us they'd be there a year but now the Financial Times is reporting, oh no!
[02:10:37.290 --> 02:10:40.292]  The military is now saying we'll be there forever, Paul.
[02:10:40.312 --> 02:10:44.916]  And our military is building a fence all the way around the country.
[02:10:44.936 --> 02:10:45.897]  We've already built half of it.
[02:10:46.237 --> 02:10:48.259]  But we can't have our military on our border, Paul.
[02:10:49.469 --> 02:10:49.930]  Well, no.
[02:10:50.010 --> 02:10:52.432]  What's the first thing they did when they went into Afghanistan?
[02:10:52.492 --> 02:10:54.475]  Kicked out the drug control agency.
[02:10:55.015 --> 02:10:57.398]  The opium exports skyrocketed.
[02:10:57.818 --> 02:11:00.701]  And then they gave amnesty to all the drug traffickers.
[02:11:00.721 --> 02:11:02.643]  It's now a tenfold increase.
[02:11:03.224 --> 02:11:04.926]  Yeah, so they're back in control of that.
[02:11:04.986 --> 02:11:11.293]  And the rest of the country is run by warlords, as it was before they went into the invasion.
[02:11:11.989 --> 02:11:22.437]  So it's back to the same thing it was, but the CIA is back in control of the drug trade, which is all they wanted, and the permanent military base to launch attacks on neighbouring countries like Iran.
[02:11:22.987 --> 02:11:34.977]  A few months ago, we talked about terrorists in the hands of justice, run by the terrorists in Iraq, paid for by our government, where dozens of people each night, with their teeth knocked out and bloody faces, confess to being terrorists.
[02:11:35.117 --> 02:11:37.119]  Stealing anything is now terrorism.
[02:11:37.679 --> 02:11:47.988]  A no-judge, no-jury, you just marched on live TV to say that you're a terrorist, and now they're expanding the program, but they have admitted that they do go and grab people's wives, children, mothers,
[02:11:48.764 --> 02:11:53.606]  To make them, quote, turn themselves in and confess, and then the confession is considered valid.
[02:11:53.626 --> 02:11:54.527]  This is our government!
[02:11:55.787 --> 02:11:56.228]  Reuters!
[02:11:56.808 --> 02:11:58.089]  Iraqi suspects say U.S.
[02:11:58.129 --> 02:11:59.549]  troops took mother hostage.
[02:11:59.929 --> 02:12:02.250]  An Iraqi apparently subjected by U.S.
[02:12:02.291 --> 02:12:05.952]  troops to taking part in attacks in Baghdad accused U.S.
[02:12:05.992 --> 02:12:11.355]  forces on Tuesday of taking his mother and sister hostage to pressure him and his brothers to surrender for questioning.
[02:12:11.635 --> 02:12:13.756]  Boy, that's a new tactic that they're doing.
[02:12:15.293 --> 02:12:23.644]  Well, it goes back to the P-2-O-G thing, where they said they'd stir up hostilities amongst terrorist groups by... Killing their families, yeah.
[02:12:23.825 --> 02:12:25.567]  Killing and abducting family members.
[02:12:27.149 --> 02:12:32.917]  And the people in this reality TV show blatantly show signs of torture.
[02:12:34.059 --> 02:12:42.281]  Here in Britain, we just had the British ambassador come out and say that the British government were using evidence obtained from torture in Uzbekistan.
[02:12:43.321 --> 02:12:46.222]  And they say they're going to use it, but at the same time saying they're against torture.
[02:12:46.582 --> 02:12:54.303]  A handwritten sign in Arabic on the front gate of their house read, Be a man, Mohammed Maqeef, and give yourself up, and then we will release your sisters.
[02:12:54.763 --> 02:12:57.064]  Otherwise, they will spend a long time in the
[02:12:57.913 --> 02:13:01.182]  In detention, it was signed Bandit 6, apparently U.S.
[02:13:01.222 --> 02:13:02.807]  code, Army code.
[02:13:02.827 --> 02:13:03.549]  Go ahead.
[02:13:05.114 --> 02:13:11.118]  Well yeah, now they've got the tip system set up in Iraq where people report their neighbors, get cash bonuses.
[02:13:11.559 --> 02:13:14.501]  By the way, why do they all call themselves Bandit?
[02:13:14.861 --> 02:13:16.982]  Or 666 Beastmaster?
[02:13:17.963 --> 02:13:24.708]  Or, uh, uh, uh, they call themselves the name of the Soviets in Red Dawn and call the insurgents Wolverines?
[02:13:25.088 --> 02:13:27.129]  Why are they giving themselves all evil names?
[02:13:27.189 --> 02:13:31.012]  You know, that's always meant something, you know, when you give yourself an evil name.
[02:13:32.424 --> 02:13:41.329]  Well, I mean, at the lower levels, like, you know, troops having skull and bones on their tanks, they probably just think it's cool, but at the higher levels, we know what these people are into.
[02:13:41.349 --> 02:13:48.933]  They think they draw power from that, so to affiliate themselves with it, supposedly, in their eyes, would give them more power to carry out what they're doing.
[02:13:49.313 --> 02:13:55.036]  Look, until the end of World War I, we never had skulls, death, stuff was not allowed in the military.
[02:13:56.094 --> 02:14:00.676]  Uh, and, uh, actually, uh, the first to do it were the Germans in modern history.
[02:14:00.716 --> 02:14:06.418]  They're field marshals in World War I, wore giant skulls on their hats, in some cases, huge devil horns.
[02:14:06.518 --> 02:14:08.939]  Folks, it's actually in the new film, okay?
[02:14:09.359 --> 02:14:09.919]  I'm not kidding.
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:10.900]  Actual photos of this.
[02:14:11.579 --> 02:14:15.823]  You know, devil horns, skulls, uh, because it's the order of death.
[02:14:16.284 --> 02:14:19.567]  But the military, uh, started affixing this as official symbols.
[02:14:19.847 --> 02:14:27.555]  Now, others have picked it up, but we have the Reuters photos of 666 on the helicopter, 666 on the tanks, human skulls, body parts hanging off.
[02:14:27.975 --> 02:14:28.916]  I mean, this is sickening!
[02:14:30.465 --> 02:14:42.956]  Yeah, and then we had the video a few weeks ago where they're just out casually shooting dogs multiple times and having various sorts of fun like that, which they also do to people... Well, that dog... Hold on a minute, Paul!
[02:14:42.976 --> 02:14:44.197]  That dog is with Al-Qaeda!
[02:14:45.638 --> 02:14:47.940]  That dog is hiding the weapons of mass destruction.
[02:14:49.116 --> 02:15:00.184]  They treat the people the same, the people who they've been caught, the innocent people they've been caught shooting, and basically, if you don't work directly for the occupational government, you're considered an insurgent.
[02:15:00.464 --> 02:15:03.046]  And they wear RFID bracelets if they're good workers.
[02:15:03.726 --> 02:15:10.371]  Yeah, and they can't get back in, the collusions couldn't get back into the town unless they accepted the ID card.
[02:15:13.193 --> 02:15:14.414]  Paul, where does it all end?
[02:15:17.285 --> 02:15:40.631]  Well, the question is whether this was all planned for in the first place and whether, you know, it's going to end up in the coal for a draft because we're so tied down in Iraq, you know, even North Korea launches a nuke which hits Alaska as they've already done with a dummy test run, a terrorist bombing in Syria blamed on the Syrian government
[02:15:41.537 --> 02:15:45.979]  Anything that would mandate the call for a draft, because we're tied down in Iraq.
[02:15:46.059 --> 02:15:47.580]  Maybe that was the plan all along.
[02:15:49.701 --> 02:15:56.365]  Well, and they've also said that, quote, if our forces are tied down in the war on terror, foreign assets may have to save us during an attack.
[02:15:57.185 --> 02:15:59.906]  The Army War College is saying that, the UN is saying that.
[02:16:00.527 --> 02:16:04.989]  We've got top generals talking about setting aside the Constitution for a military form of government.
[02:16:05.009 --> 02:16:08.751]  I mean, they're openly talking about this, Paul.
[02:16:09.694 --> 02:16:10.174]  Exactly.
[02:16:10.914 --> 02:16:18.896]  They're already hiring Cuban mercenaries and various mercenaries from different countries to do duties in Iraq and trying to keep that quiet.
[02:16:19.336 --> 02:16:24.978]  They've reinstituted the death squads, which they used in Honduras to go and hunt people down.
[02:16:25.878 --> 02:16:28.958]  So, blow by blow, they're using the same tactics again.
[02:16:30.459 --> 02:16:32.279]  And again, folks, this is not our opinion.
[02:16:32.319 --> 02:16:33.540]  This is all admitted.
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:35.440]  This is going on.
[02:16:36.494 --> 02:16:37.694]  The head of all U.S.
[02:16:37.754 --> 02:16:42.656]  intelligence now is Negroponte, who was the Death Squad commander and organizer.
[02:16:43.476 --> 02:16:45.437]  And he helped set up the Death Squads in Iraq.
[02:16:46.317 --> 02:16:47.338]  And this is the guy.
[02:16:47.358 --> 02:16:54.920]  I mean, they want power, they want control, they know you're naive, they know you're sappy and well-meaning, and just don't get it.
[02:16:54.980 --> 02:17:00.522]  Paul, how do we get people to stop being naive and stop seeing the world according to their worldview?
[02:17:00.742 --> 02:17:02.803]  Well, I'm a nice person, so the world must be nice.
[02:17:04.210 --> 02:17:07.854]  Well, that's the thing which I try to emphasize to people on many occasions.
[02:17:08.414 --> 02:17:14.300]  People are only concerned about their children, their lives, if they foresee a problem that's happening in their back garden.
[02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:20.586]  You just have to point out to them that this is their back garden, this is the future of their children, and it does directly affect them.
[02:17:21.146 --> 02:17:25.130]  And it will on a day-to-day basis as it clamps down more and more.
[02:17:25.470 --> 02:17:25.951]  Absolutely.
[02:17:25.991 --> 02:17:28.413]  We've got a break, and when we get back we'll go write your calls.
[02:17:28.433 --> 02:17:30.215]  There's a big old stack of news here.
[02:17:31.204 --> 02:17:33.026]  That we'll be covering as well.
[02:17:33.126 --> 02:17:34.007]  So much more coming up.
[02:17:34.147 --> 02:17:35.248]  First, your interesting calls.
[02:17:36.069 --> 02:17:37.531]  We'll bam, bam, bam through those.
[02:17:37.571 --> 02:17:40.454]  When we get back on the other side, don't forget the new website.
[02:17:40.474 --> 02:17:41.155]  Well, it's not too new.
[02:17:41.195 --> 02:17:42.216]  It's almost a year old now.
[02:17:42.696 --> 02:17:43.357]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:17:44.964 --> 02:17:51.189]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:59.415]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:17:59.756 --> 02:18:07.602]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:18:07.922 --> 02:18:12.666]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:18:13.006 --> 02:18:17.710]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:18:18.231 --> 02:18:22.074]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:18:22.594 --> 02:18:23.595]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:18:23.675 --> 02:18:27.758]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.

[02:18:33.083 --> 02:18:35.605]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.

[02:19:44.473 --> 02:19:46.974]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:47.634 --> 02:19:54.277]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[02:19:55.457 --> 02:19:57.698]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[02:19:58.533 --> 02:20:04.778]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[02:20:05.679 --> 02:20:13.785]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[02:20:14.805 --> 02:20:22.671]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:44.807 --> 02:20:47.609]  I'm truly amazed at the improvements my heart showed after my heart attack.
[02:20:47.889 --> 02:20:49.049]  Thank you, Cardivite.
[02:20:49.109 --> 02:20:54.092]  I was having a hard time breathing and had to rest in the afternoons, but since Cardivite, that's all changed now.
[02:20:54.172 --> 02:20:57.714]  I've had chronic fatigue for 12 years now and decided to try Cardivite.
[02:20:57.774 --> 02:20:59.735]  Boy, it's improved my energy dramatically.
[02:20:59.755 --> 02:21:00.216]  Cardivite.
[02:21:00.256 --> 02:21:00.796]  Cardivite.
[02:21:00.836 --> 02:21:02.397]  We all use Cardivite!
[02:21:03.260 --> 02:21:06.741]  Ladies and gentlemen, Heart Drop 2000 presents Cardivite.

[02:21:23.591 --> 02:21:24.732]  That's 1-877-928-8822.
[02:22:00.100 --> 02:22:04.143]  Basically, they're building a robotic control grid frozen all around us.
[02:22:05.364 --> 02:22:16.332]  The most petty of offenses will result in forced drugging, having your vehicles taken, your home being taken, brutal police that are taught they have to keep us in line for our own interests like we're a bunch of dumb cattle.
[02:22:16.712 --> 02:22:23.276]  This is the warping that's going on, but it doesn't have to succeed if you stand up and say no and inform others.
[02:22:23.316 --> 02:22:24.978]  They've got to sell us on slavery.
[02:22:25.318 --> 02:22:28.620]  Brian in Tennessee, then Mike, Joe, Jamie, and others.
[02:22:28.780 --> 02:22:29.461]  Go ahead, Brian.
[02:22:30.123 --> 02:22:31.424]  Hi Alex, I'm a big fan.
[02:22:31.545 --> 02:22:33.446]  I just want to thank you for waking me up.
[02:22:34.147 --> 02:22:40.113]  And the reason I'm calling is I wonder if you've seen that new Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller movie, Sin City.
[02:22:40.834 --> 02:22:45.418]  Yeah, I mean, overall it's got some bad stuff in it, but it's pretty anti-government.
[02:22:45.839 --> 02:22:47.500]  Yeah, that's why I'm going to call about it.
[02:22:47.641 --> 02:22:49.983]  I thought it was, it sort of holds a mirror up.
[02:22:50.003 --> 02:22:52.846]  It's got the corrupt politician protecting his son.
[02:22:53.590 --> 02:22:56.573]  But it also makes torture look really cool, you know?
[02:22:57.013 --> 02:22:58.955]  That's the problem with it.
[02:22:58.975 --> 02:23:10.446]  But at the same time, I don't fault Robert Rodriguez for that because I thought it was a great movie, but I just hate to think of the four-year-old kids watching that going home playing Grand Theft Auto for three hours and taking Ritalin and Prozac.
[02:23:10.486 --> 02:23:14.910]  Well, I'm not trying to grovel just because I know some people that were involved in the film.
[02:23:14.930 --> 02:23:16.051]  They made it in Austin.
[02:23:16.718 --> 02:23:21.761]  And I know that the folks over there have seen my videos and like them, I've been told that.
[02:23:22.321 --> 02:23:28.185]  And the film, the Frank Miller script, I mean, the government is carrying out the terror attacks.
[02:23:28.805 --> 02:23:33.008]  I mean, not terror attacks, but the government's running the drugs, running the child kidnapping.
[02:23:33.028 --> 02:23:34.989]  The occult serial killer and all that stuff.
[02:23:35.770 --> 02:23:38.831]  And just so you can tell the callers, I'll keep it real short here.
[02:23:39.352 --> 02:23:43.014]  The same thing was, I've been watching cable TV yesterday in a hotel room.
[02:23:43.533 --> 02:23:50.455]  And I saw, like, two or three times a direct parallel drawn between the white supremacist movement and the constitutional movement.
[02:23:50.495 --> 02:23:54.997]  I saw a History Channel piece, a CMT piece... No, no, that's the new thing!
[02:23:55.017 --> 02:23:56.397]  You say, I hate Nazis!
[02:23:56.457 --> 02:23:58.058]  I love the Constitution!
[02:23:58.178 --> 02:23:59.158]  That's code for Nazi!
[02:23:59.298 --> 02:24:00.638]  That's code for Nazi!
[02:24:00.658 --> 02:24:02.299]  Just everything is Nazi now!
[02:24:02.319 --> 02:24:03.939]  Oh, you're pro-gun!
[02:24:03.959 --> 02:24:05.660]  That's a Nazi!
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:11.922]  It made me think that they've probably been calling you that for a long time, and maybe they're gonna up it up, you know, keep calling you that.
[02:24:12.597 --> 02:24:13.457]  Get louder about it.
[02:24:13.477 --> 02:24:17.038]  They don't call me that or I'll sue them.
[02:24:17.078 --> 02:24:19.039]  They didn't really say it.
[02:24:19.079 --> 02:24:21.619]  They did one on the white supremacist movement.
[02:24:21.639 --> 02:24:22.960]  They do it right next to each other.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:23.980]  Guilt by association.
[02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:26.581]  They don't say it, but they throw caress right in the middle of it.
[02:24:27.641 --> 02:24:31.762]  Listen, they had a New York Times piece years ago with Bin Laden.
[02:24:32.927 --> 02:24:34.408]  And clan leaders?
[02:24:35.008 --> 02:24:36.510]  And it was all in one article.
[02:24:36.850 --> 02:24:39.712]  Bill Laudan and clan leaders, and then, oh, Alex Jones!
[02:24:40.132 --> 02:24:41.813]  Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:24:41.853 --> 02:24:43.194]  You can't sue him for that, though, can you?
[02:24:44.255 --> 02:24:45.135]  Uh, no, not really.
[02:24:45.716 --> 02:24:46.596]  It's strictly done.
[02:24:46.616 --> 02:24:48.318]  That's the only thing they respect, though.
[02:24:49.538 --> 02:24:51.179]  They only respect getting sued.
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:52.821]  And Alex, the last thing, I love you.
[02:24:52.841 --> 02:24:53.701]  You're my biggest hero.
[02:24:53.741 --> 02:24:56.963]  The last thing is, who's... And then I'll just hang up and listen to your response.
[02:24:59.381 --> 02:25:02.363]  Who's going to play George W. Bush in a 9-1-1 movie?
[02:25:02.443 --> 02:25:03.744]  Clint Eastwood or Sean Connery?
[02:25:05.605 --> 02:25:11.508]  Yeah, they've got a bunch of movies coming out worshiping Bush where he saves everyone on 9-11.
[02:25:11.528 --> 02:25:12.549]  Paul, comments to that?
[02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:26.398]  Yeah, the other movie that I haven't seen, but we got a reader do a review of it, was The Final Cut, starring Robin Williams, which is about a brain chip which records your entire life.
[02:25:27.191 --> 02:25:37.016]  According to the guy who saw it, who did a review for us, they portray the people opposed to the chip as religious crazies.
[02:25:37.116 --> 02:25:38.617]  And everybody has the chip.
[02:25:39.857 --> 02:25:42.999]  Most of the general public has it, according to the review.
[02:25:43.459 --> 02:25:51.863]  Well, look, I mean, a few weeks ago I was listening to a book on tape, when I'm out driving around in my spare time, and it was a 2001 Space Odyssey.
[02:25:55.030 --> 02:25:58.092]  And in that, everybody's a kook that doesn't have the chip.
[02:25:58.572 --> 02:25:59.673]  You've all got a brain chip.
[02:26:00.413 --> 02:26:01.193]  It's just everywhere.
[02:26:01.554 --> 02:26:11.899]  The guy you had on for an interview a few months ago talked about how the rest of society shouldn't hold the frontiers of technology back by refusing the chip.
[02:26:12.059 --> 02:26:13.780]  Well, he said we should be made to do it.
[02:26:14.421 --> 02:26:14.701]  Yeah.
[02:26:15.121 --> 02:26:16.862]  This is one of your little government minions.
[02:26:17.893 --> 02:26:19.274]  Yes, but it's not just the movies.
[02:26:19.314 --> 02:26:21.635]  It's people really coming out and seeing it.
[02:26:21.655 --> 02:26:23.796]  Well, Sean Hannity says every child needs it.
[02:26:23.916 --> 02:26:25.137]  I know it was product placement.
[02:26:25.737 --> 02:26:28.319]  And like, show after show, I buy them stock.
[02:26:28.339 --> 02:26:29.720]  This is every child needs one.
[02:26:30.760 --> 02:26:33.442]  I don't think they're going to ram it through on the security basis.
[02:26:33.482 --> 02:26:35.923]  Mainly, though, it's going to be the cultural fad basis.
[02:26:36.003 --> 02:26:37.644]  It's going to be the next mobile phone.
[02:26:38.224 --> 02:26:39.665]  Well, yeah, you just got to have it.
[02:26:39.745 --> 02:26:41.266]  Well, you don't have to work at this corporation.
[02:26:41.286 --> 02:26:42.487]  Well, it's like the Mexican Herding General.
[02:26:42.727 --> 02:26:45.048]  Got to have the chip under your skin if you want to work here.
[02:26:45.448 --> 02:26:46.569]  I'm not making you work here.
[02:26:47.242 --> 02:26:51.525]  Let's see, when everything is a government job or a government-controlled job, you don't have to have a job here.
[02:26:52.645 --> 02:26:54.066]  You've just got to have the chip, buddy.
[02:26:54.086 --> 02:26:56.728]  Paul, why don't you just take the chip?
[02:26:56.748 --> 02:26:57.668]  You know it'd be much easier.
[02:26:57.688 --> 02:27:01.450]  I mean, we're here talking about how they want us to take the chip, folks.
[02:27:01.691 --> 02:27:02.871]  I mean, it's gotten to that point.
[02:27:04.132 --> 02:27:08.775]  They're putting the RFID chip in all the soccer World Cup tickets as well.
[02:27:08.795 --> 02:27:10.596]  That's in 2006, next year, so...
[02:27:13.425 --> 02:27:17.526]  Yeah, down the line on a cultural level, we're introducing it as well as security level.
[02:27:19.087 --> 02:27:20.507]  Gotta stop evil Al C.I.A.
[02:27:20.608 --> 02:27:21.248]  They gotta do it.
[02:27:21.648 --> 02:27:24.529]  Gotta arrest people who don't return one library book.
[02:27:24.589 --> 02:27:26.590]  It's... all is free, Luke.
[02:27:27.530 --> 02:27:30.431]  We'll take your calls and cover more news on the other side of this quick break.
[02:27:31.111 --> 02:27:31.851]  Stay with us!
[02:27:35.373 --> 02:27:36.293]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.753 --> 02:27:38.374]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.394 --> 02:27:41.975]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.347 --> 02:27:52.849]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:53.249 --> 02:27:57.491]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:27:57.731 --> 02:28:04.734]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.134 --> 02:28:11.258]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:11.278 --> 02:28:12.639]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:15.902]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:28:16.042 --> 02:28:18.083]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:28:18.383 --> 02:28:25.628]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:28:25.929 --> 02:28:29.311]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:28:29.731 --> 02:28:34.397]  For more information call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time that's 866-885-6625 call today!
[02:28:44.861 --> 02:28:51.108]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.228 --> 02:28:57.394]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:57.674 --> 02:29:06.063]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:06.343 --> 02:29:13.370]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:13.691 --> 02:29:18.516]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:18.736 --> 02:29:24.141]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:24.482 --> 02:29:27.505]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:27.865 --> 02:29:35.833]  Get the Illuminated Berkey Bass for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:35.873 --> 02:29:36.473]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:48.404]  With gardening season coming up, you'll soon be building your compost pile.
[02:29:48.604 --> 02:29:51.307]  And that's why there's a great gardening tool I have to tell you about.
[02:29:51.487 --> 02:29:52.869]  It's called the Compost Twin.
[02:29:53.049 --> 02:30:02.981]  Gardeners know the importance of composting, but we're all too familiar with the back-breaking work of turning a compost pile with a pitchfork and the messy accumulation of kitchen scraps while you wait for a batch of compost to cook.
[02:30:03.201 --> 02:30:04.923]  So Mantis developed the Compost Twin
[02:30:05.183 --> 02:30:09.068]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10 bushel bins on one machine.
[02:30:09.308 --> 02:30:13.733]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:30:13.933 --> 02:30:17.757]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy turn gear system.
[02:30:18.017 --> 02:30:24.144]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.
[02:30:24.384 --> 02:30:27.205]  No more mess, no more odors, no more hard work.
[02:30:27.345 --> 02:30:30.707]  Deal direct with Mantis and get a no-hassle, one-year money-back guarantee.
[02:30:30.787 --> 02:30:34.648]  Call Mantis now for a free video and information kit on the Compost Twin.
[02:30:34.668 --> 02:30:35.989]  Call toll-free 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[02:30:36.149 --> 02:30:36.569]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[02:30:47.676 --> 02:30:53.703]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:54.304 --> 02:30:57.288]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:05.120 --> 02:31:05.961]  Alright, we're back live.
[02:31:05.981 --> 02:31:07.963]  I've just got time to take five more calls.
[02:31:08.023 --> 02:31:09.064]  Let's do that quickly.
[02:31:09.104 --> 02:31:11.045]  And then, Paul, what's some of the other news you want to get into?
[02:31:11.106 --> 02:31:13.928]  I want to comment on this Gannon story in the big newspapers.
[02:31:14.809 --> 02:31:17.711]  And I want to also get into Norwegian government forces.
[02:31:17.732 --> 02:31:21.535]  40% of female employment or businesses get shut down.
[02:31:21.575 --> 02:31:22.316]  That's freedom.
[02:31:22.676 --> 02:31:24.618]  But what's some of the other news you want to hit on?
[02:31:26.379 --> 02:31:30.303]  Just the show thing about how they're hyping the flu pandemic and who's going to be behind that.
[02:31:31.142 --> 02:31:34.945]  Also, a little bit more on the terror drills, which you need to talk about.
[02:31:37.146 --> 02:31:39.308]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[02:31:39.428 --> 02:31:43.851]  Let's talk to Mike in Washington.
[02:31:43.911 --> 02:31:44.751]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:31:45.352 --> 02:31:45.972]  Alex, Paul.
[02:31:46.152 --> 02:31:46.933]  Great to see you guys.
[02:31:47.193 --> 02:31:47.933]  Hello, my friend.
[02:31:47.953 --> 02:31:49.114]  Hey, listen, Alex.
[02:31:49.354 --> 02:31:59.661]  A couple of good friends of mine were in town this weekend and in a week, and they're Dr. Lorin Moray and Sergeant Dennis Kine.
[02:32:00.222 --> 02:32:08.205]  He's a 15-year veteran of Gulf War I, and Lorraine Ray is a Livermore Nuclear Weapons Lab whistleblower.
[02:32:09.465 --> 02:32:18.248]  They're up in Seattle right now, but in the interest of the info war and force multiplication, I'd like to extend the opportunity to get them on an interview with you.
[02:32:18.428 --> 02:32:19.589]  Sure, what do they talk about?
[02:32:22.186 --> 02:32:25.510]  They were both at the World's Uranium Weapons Conference in Hamburg.
[02:32:25.550 --> 02:32:27.192]  They talked about depleting uranium.
[02:32:27.212 --> 02:32:31.096]  Yeah, well, we've had Dr. Rocky on, who wrote the book on it.
[02:32:31.136 --> 02:32:32.457]  I mean, it's deadly for the troops.
[02:32:32.578 --> 02:32:35.341]  Yeah, they're going around and doing this.
[02:32:35.581 --> 02:32:39.725]  They're giving talks all around the nation on their dime, and they just have all kinds of information.
[02:32:40.686 --> 02:32:43.789]  But I mean, think about how arrogant the global controllers are.
[02:32:44.229 --> 02:32:49.193]  They use a weapon that they know kills the people in our own troops, that they know is deadly.
[02:32:49.554 --> 02:32:50.815]  It's been proven it's in the troops.
[02:32:50.835 --> 02:32:52.056]  It's been proven it's killing them.
[02:32:52.676 --> 02:32:53.097]  Exactly.
[02:32:53.137 --> 02:32:54.758]  Major newspapers have done blood tests.
[02:32:54.818 --> 02:32:56.039]  It's in them, high levels.
[02:32:56.440 --> 02:32:57.721]  And they just say, we don't care.
[02:32:57.881 --> 02:32:58.782]  It's good for you.
[02:32:59.122 --> 02:33:00.343]  And they're talking about more war.
[02:33:00.383 --> 02:33:06.148]  Well, there's some war crimes that need to be paid for before we move on to the next set of wiping everything out.
[02:33:07.037 --> 02:33:09.819]  Yeah, but you see, George Bush makes the law.
[02:33:09.919 --> 02:33:12.682]  His Attorney General said he's above the law.
[02:33:13.923 --> 02:33:16.024]  Karl Rove says they create reality.
[02:33:16.405 --> 02:33:18.747]  So if they say DU is nutritious, it is.
[02:33:19.147 --> 02:33:21.569]  I guess if they say cyanide is delicious, it is.
[02:33:24.711 --> 02:33:33.679]  Yeah, Lorraine had a video of Stone Phillips and Jane Pauley on DU, and it's something you'll never see on TV again.
[02:33:33.719 --> 02:33:36.040]  I think that's why they calmly disappeared.
[02:33:37.583 --> 02:33:39.224]  It was some pretty damning evidence.
[02:33:39.264 --> 02:33:44.808]  I mean, they came right out and said that it kills our troops and the enemy, and how bad it was.
[02:33:44.848 --> 02:33:46.309]  It was a dateline, actually.
[02:33:47.851 --> 02:33:49.432]  It's a great video clip.
[02:33:49.892 --> 02:33:50.853]  I appreciate the call.
[02:33:50.893 --> 02:33:53.735]  Yeah, email me contact info for your friends.
[02:33:53.775 --> 02:33:54.375]  I might get them on.
[02:33:54.435 --> 02:33:54.956]  Sounds interesting.
[02:33:55.716 --> 02:34:00.400]  Paul, though, I mean, really, I agree with Karl Rove, and I agree with Gonzales.
[02:34:01.315 --> 02:34:07.843]  I mean, if Gonzalez is pro-abortion, and he doesn't want 12-year-olds to have to tell their parents they're having him, that's pro-life.
[02:34:08.564 --> 02:34:15.133]  If he says torture is good up until death, and that if they torture you to death it's not their fault, I think that's good.
[02:34:15.153 --> 02:34:20.119]  I think if he says DU, I think if the government says DU is good for you, it is.
[02:34:21.048 --> 02:34:26.892]  I mean, I think if they say jumping off a 10,000 foot cliff is good for you, it is.
[02:34:27.073 --> 02:34:35.259]  I mean, maybe they do control reality, and Ashcroft never said there was a Patriot Act, and when he said there was, he never said that.
[02:34:35.319 --> 02:34:40.803]  And when Rumsfeld never said there were weapons of mass destruction, he says that's an urban legend conspiracy.
[02:34:41.083 --> 02:34:41.783]  I agree with him.
[02:34:42.944 --> 02:34:43.885]  Up is down, down is up.
[02:34:43.925 --> 02:34:45.726]  If they say black is white, I guess it is.
[02:34:45.786 --> 02:34:47.828]  If they say war is peace, I guess it is.
[02:34:48.568 --> 02:34:50.952]  I guess of installing dictatorships of democracy?
[02:34:50.992 --> 02:34:51.834]  I guess it is, Paul.
[02:34:52.174 --> 02:34:54.017]  I mean, maybe something's wrong with us, my friend.
[02:34:55.439 --> 02:35:03.472]  Well, no, they believe in this whole creating reality thing, because they're from the school of Straussian philosophy.
[02:35:04.681 --> 02:35:13.007]  Which believed in the noble lie that one can tell a giant lie if it enhances the greater good of the overall agenda.
[02:35:13.307 --> 02:35:18.710]  Which is basically the same thing that Hitler said, you know, the bigger the lie you tell, the greater number of people believe it.
[02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:21.172]  So that's why they believe in creating reality.
[02:35:21.292 --> 02:35:21.612]  I know!
[02:35:21.712 --> 02:35:27.796]  If I got on air and said I was God, I think a lot of people would actually follow and believe it.
[02:35:27.816 --> 02:35:29.217]  I think if you did, they would.
[02:35:31.111 --> 02:35:35.195]  I mean, we could just say, if it's ridiculous and stupid, they'll believe it.
[02:35:35.975 --> 02:35:37.937]  But if it's, here's the bill, it says this.
[02:35:37.997 --> 02:35:38.898]  No, it's not true.
[02:35:41.059 --> 02:35:41.740]  Well, exactly.
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:43.721]  Paul, I'm going to have to let people in on a secret.
[02:35:43.741 --> 02:35:46.143]  You are actually a 180 pound rabbit.
[02:35:46.684 --> 02:35:47.745]  With big pink ears.
[02:35:48.665 --> 02:35:50.047]  And you fly a spaceship, Paul.
[02:35:50.627 --> 02:35:52.789]  I was hoping I wouldn't get out, but you blowed it.
[02:35:53.730 --> 02:35:55.591]  I have a government document showing it's true.
[02:35:56.051 --> 02:35:58.794]  Oh man, I tell you what.
[02:36:02.014 --> 02:36:04.456]  But no, Rumsfeld never said there were weapons of mass destruction, Paul.
[02:36:04.476 --> 02:36:05.416]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[02:36:05.436 --> 02:36:06.117]  He never said that.
[02:36:06.137 --> 02:36:08.679]  It doesn't matter if we all saw him on TV a hundred times saying it, Paul.
[02:36:08.839 --> 02:36:09.359]  He didn't say it.
[02:36:09.379 --> 02:36:10.000]  Do you understand me?
[02:36:11.781 --> 02:36:12.241]  Exactly.
[02:36:13.122 --> 02:36:20.127]  Even though the latest intelligence report said that they were dead wrong, and yet it doesn't blame any of them for it.
[02:36:20.147 --> 02:36:22.228]  It's all the intelligence agency's fault.
[02:36:22.328 --> 02:36:24.050]  And Bush says he needs more power and control.
[02:36:24.070 --> 02:36:24.290]  See?
[02:36:24.310 --> 02:36:25.651]  This proves that he needs more power.
[02:36:26.731 --> 02:36:28.753]  Because he ordered them to lie at Chelsea.
[02:36:28.773 --> 02:36:30.694]  He actually got on the news and said, See?
[02:36:30.794 --> 02:36:31.355]  I told you!
[02:36:33.763 --> 02:36:36.064]  But they may have made a mistake, so what do we do?
[02:36:36.104 --> 02:36:37.964]  Well, we promote Condoleezza Rice.
[02:36:39.665 --> 02:36:43.086]  That's the reward for making mistakes, whereas we know they're not mistakes.
[02:36:44.966 --> 02:36:46.747]  Now, Condi doesn't lie.
[02:36:46.767 --> 02:36:49.187]  She's a good person.
[02:36:52.168 --> 02:36:53.008]  Don't be mean to her.
[02:36:53.288 --> 02:36:56.009]  Are you racist?
[02:36:56.049 --> 02:36:59.470]  No, I mean, anybody, you criticize anybody, you're racist.
[02:37:00.889 --> 02:37:01.350]  Exactly.
[02:37:01.730 --> 02:37:02.611]  Including white people.
[02:37:03.631 --> 02:37:06.494]  Let's talk to Joe in Wisconsin.
[02:37:06.534 --> 02:37:07.194]  Joe, go ahead.
[02:37:07.715 --> 02:37:08.395]  Hey Alex Paul.
[02:37:08.556 --> 02:37:09.516]  Wow, what a segue.
[02:37:10.217 --> 02:37:14.580]  My apologies if I get technical, but I had an interesting day at intake court.
[02:37:15.962 --> 02:37:20.465]  Two months ago, I was illegally stopped and searched, and the cop went fishing.
[02:37:20.966 --> 02:37:22.087]  You want me to explain what that means?
[02:37:22.567 --> 02:37:23.408]  Digging through your vehicle.
[02:37:23.868 --> 02:37:26.490]  Well, digging through my personal items, so yeah.
[02:37:26.991 --> 02:37:28.332]  He said he wanted to
[02:37:29.344 --> 02:37:29.584]  I don't
[02:37:44.756 --> 02:37:45.877]  Ask you how you want to plead.
[02:37:46.137 --> 02:37:48.498]  And he said... And in the pleadings you pray.
[02:37:49.459 --> 02:37:51.320]  Read court pleadings, you pray to the court.
[02:37:51.660 --> 02:37:52.160]  Well, I have it.
[02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:53.021]  It's a temple.
[02:37:53.041 --> 02:37:53.761]  It's a temple.
[02:37:54.142 --> 02:37:56.583]  He said, if found guilty, you owe blank.
[02:37:56.883 --> 02:37:59.425]  And if you plead guilty or no contest, you'll owe half.
[02:37:59.885 --> 02:38:00.926]  And then you can be done with it.
[02:38:01.326 --> 02:38:03.387]  And it makes it sound like... Yeah, that's the good thing.
[02:38:03.667 --> 02:38:05.168]  You have a choice to be guilty or guilty.
[02:38:05.228 --> 02:38:06.429]  Give us one of your pleads.
[02:38:06.529 --> 02:38:07.950]  I chose the fourth option.
[02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:11.592]  I said, no, I need and require a court of record.
[02:38:12.210 --> 02:38:14.315]  And he says, no, no, no, I need your plea.
[02:38:14.515 --> 02:38:16.359]  I said, no, I need the court of record.
[02:38:18.052 --> 02:38:20.213]  It takes it to a different level.
[02:38:20.233 --> 02:38:22.494]  You know, it's a statutory court.
[02:38:22.774 --> 02:38:30.538]  Yeah, they try to convince you to do a plea bargain up front, and they pose, and they've gotten slick about plea bargains where they act like a plea bargain is a normal court proceeding.
[02:38:30.678 --> 02:38:32.039]  Well, he entered it for me.
[02:38:32.479 --> 02:38:37.421]  I said, Your Honor, do you understand the difference between a statutory court and a common law court?
[02:38:37.441 --> 02:38:39.782]  Hey, judges are now going, I've decided no jury.
[02:38:39.842 --> 02:38:41.023]  I'm sure you've heard about those cases.
[02:38:41.043 --> 02:38:41.823]  They've just got no jury.
[02:38:42.123 --> 02:38:43.124]  Yeah, I've heard about that.
[02:38:44.044 --> 02:38:45.845]  And it's just made up!
[02:38:45.865 --> 02:38:48.706]  I mean, I guess a judge might announce their God tomorrow!
[02:38:49.166 --> 02:38:56.268]  Well, I wanted to ask Paul if they have common law over there in Great Britain, because it sounds like our law system came from them.
[02:38:56.669 --> 02:39:05.912]  Yeah, it comes from Mount Sinai with Moses and the Ten Commandments, then 1214 Magna Carta, and out of that Runnymede, 1776 Declaration of Independence, and 1789 Constitution, Bill of Rights.
[02:39:12.839 --> 02:39:22.761]  I was just wondering if there was a section on either Prison Planet or Infowars that had constitutional law on there, because I've been digging through a lot of... Yeah, there's a lot of stuff we need to do on the site.
[02:39:22.801 --> 02:39:24.101]  We're just so... it's hard to do it all.
[02:39:24.241 --> 02:39:25.822]  Well, you guys are doing a wonderful job.
[02:39:25.842 --> 02:39:31.543]  I was just going to mention also that I think Genesis is the third rail of justice, and that's all I can say.
[02:39:31.563 --> 02:39:32.963]  Well, thank you.
[02:39:32.983 --> 02:39:33.543]  Good job, guys.
[02:39:33.843 --> 02:39:34.163]  Thank you.
[02:39:34.203 --> 02:39:35.123]  We try our best.
[02:39:35.624 --> 02:39:36.384]  I like this network.
[02:39:36.404 --> 02:39:37.684]  There's some shows I don't agree with.
[02:39:38.297 --> 02:39:40.301]  But, you know, that's their prerogative.
[02:39:40.762 --> 02:39:44.449]  Ted's tried to mix things up a bit, but he's never censored me, and that's what matters.
[02:39:44.770 --> 02:39:45.852]  Let me talk about whatever I want.
[02:39:47.275 --> 02:39:49.459]  Paul, comments to what our little friend was just saying?
[02:39:50.803 --> 02:40:04.868]  Well, just that, I mean, be careful when people are searching through your things, because if it's federal agents, then in this, as was the case with Brandon Mayfield, you may find yourself framed for terrorist acts, which happened.
[02:40:04.888 --> 02:40:09.650]  They first denied it, then later had to admit it with Gonzales yesterday.
[02:40:09.770 --> 02:40:13.511]  Well, I mean, they do that on all the cop shows, framing people's good, it's how you get the bad guys.
[02:40:14.311 --> 02:40:14.751]  Exactly.
[02:40:17.012 --> 02:40:18.913]  Paul, I mean, we've got to learn that
[02:40:21.113 --> 02:40:24.515]  See, you're against abortion, so you're pro-abortion.
[02:40:25.356 --> 02:40:31.160]  And then Gonzales and most of Bush's new appointees are for it, and so they're against it.
[02:40:31.240 --> 02:40:33.161]  Are you understanding that now?
[02:40:33.661 --> 02:40:35.622]  I'm starting to understand the double thing, yeah.
[02:40:35.862 --> 02:40:36.323]  Good!
[02:40:37.063 --> 02:40:37.764]  Good!
[02:40:38.564 --> 02:40:44.228]  It's like they want to put all these new gun restrictions on Bush is pushing for, and Gonzales is, with the databases.
[02:40:45.262 --> 02:40:50.965]  We're not hearing the gun groups cry out against it because, again, we'd be liberal if we were pro-gun, Paul.
[02:40:50.985 --> 02:40:52.006]  We can't be liberal.
[02:40:52.026 --> 02:40:54.207]  Ah, it's double plus good.
[02:40:54.887 --> 02:40:55.248]  Double?
[02:40:55.328 --> 02:40:57.209]  No, it's double plus plus good.
[02:40:57.769 --> 02:40:58.189]  Oh, right.
[02:40:58.990 --> 02:40:59.070]  Ah.
[02:40:59.730 --> 02:41:01.171]  Tell folks what double plus good is.
[02:41:02.232 --> 02:41:03.172]  Double plus good.
[02:41:03.492 --> 02:41:09.656]  It's the Orwellian term whereby they restrict the language so as to restrict
[02:41:10.763 --> 02:41:11.504]  People's thoughts.
[02:41:11.724 --> 02:41:13.365]  Yeah, you can't say very good.
[02:41:13.425 --> 02:41:15.006]  It just teaches you to use pluses and minuses.
[02:41:15.026 --> 02:41:16.186]  So it's double plus good.
[02:41:17.887 --> 02:41:19.388]  Or plus good or double plus good.
[02:41:20.209 --> 02:41:20.649]  That's right.
[02:41:21.629 --> 02:41:22.910]  Which they're actually doing.
[02:41:23.731 --> 02:41:26.752]  The American vocabulary has shrunk dramatically.
[02:41:26.772 --> 02:41:27.533]  They've done the studies.
[02:41:29.354 --> 02:41:30.695]  Pretty soon it'll just be grunts.
[02:41:32.976 --> 02:41:35.197]  Or we'll communicate by football team names, Paul.
[02:41:38.019 --> 02:41:39.880]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:41:41.444 --> 02:41:44.586]  Let's go ahead and talk to, you've got to laugh about this sometimes.
[02:41:44.606 --> 02:41:46.407]  We've got to hurry here.
[02:41:46.447 --> 02:41:47.508]  Chris in Texas, go ahead.
[02:41:49.910 --> 02:41:50.450]  Yes, Chris.
[02:41:51.070 --> 02:41:52.151]  Hey, how are you?
[02:41:52.391 --> 02:41:52.751]  I'm good.
[02:41:53.452 --> 02:41:57.394]  I'm a PresidentPlan.tv member, and I suggest everybody out there go get it.
[02:41:57.434 --> 02:41:59.035]  It's a really good website to be a part of.
[02:41:59.396 --> 02:42:00.476]  And get yourself a Berkey Light.
[02:42:01.097 --> 02:42:02.137]  Thank you for the plugs.
[02:42:03.598 --> 02:42:09.242]  I was reading on your free book site, the free reading books, the Antichrist Conspiracy Book.
[02:42:10.442 --> 02:42:16.686]  And it came, I ran across one part of it that blew me away and I was thinking maybe you could shed some light on it for me.
[02:42:17.767 --> 02:42:24.210]  And it described how the Copernicus model of the Earth is actually a lie and that the Earth is motionless.
[02:42:25.211 --> 02:42:26.552]  Do you know anything about this?
[02:42:26.752 --> 02:42:28.213]  No, I have no earthly idea.
[02:42:29.274 --> 02:42:32.415]  Pun intended.
[02:42:32.435 --> 02:42:35.117]  Because it says, as the Bible describes, the Earth is not moving.
[02:42:35.157 --> 02:42:36.538]  It's described in like nine passages.
[02:42:37.145 --> 02:42:42.028]  And, I mean, if this is true, I mean, this totally discredits anything NASA has ever done.
[02:42:42.048 --> 02:42:45.389]  I mean, I would just hate if you knew anything about it.
[02:42:46.410 --> 02:42:47.330]  No, I don't, sir.
[02:42:47.711 --> 02:42:48.911]  And, uh, but that's interesting.
[02:42:48.951 --> 02:42:49.732]  Anything else on your mind?
[02:42:50.712 --> 02:42:52.353]  Uh, no, not really.
[02:42:52.373 --> 02:42:55.635]  Just keep up the good work, and, man, you're in my prayers.
[02:42:55.795 --> 02:42:56.375]  Well, thank you.
[02:42:56.415 --> 02:42:57.616]  I appreciate the support, Chris.
[02:42:57.676 --> 02:42:58.936]  Jamie in Kentucky, then Phil.
[02:42:58.976 --> 02:42:59.657]  That's it for calls.
[02:42:59.697 --> 02:43:00.357]  Jamie, go ahead.
[02:43:00.637 --> 02:43:01.298]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:01.338 --> 02:43:02.178]  How you doing, buddy?
[02:43:02.358 --> 02:43:02.538]  Good.
[02:43:04.497 --> 02:43:07.799]  I think you should run for the next president of the United States.
[02:43:08.479 --> 02:43:09.300]  Yeah, that's funny.
[02:43:09.320 --> 02:43:11.421]  Well, number one, I'm not old enough.
[02:43:11.441 --> 02:43:12.021]  You've got to be 35.
[02:43:12.221 --> 02:43:12.321]  I'm 31.
[02:43:12.361 --> 02:43:18.284]  And then number two, we don't have real elections at the presidential level.
[02:43:18.624 --> 02:43:21.226]  Number three, I'm not presidential material.
[02:43:21.286 --> 02:43:22.987]  I'm just an average guy doing a radio show.
[02:43:24.968 --> 02:43:28.149]  We need Paul Watson to run against Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:43:28.510 --> 02:43:29.950]  As long as we're going to have a foreigner.
[02:43:30.010 --> 02:43:30.431]  Right, Paul?
[02:43:32.737 --> 02:43:33.738]  Hey Paul, what do you think of this?
[02:43:33.758 --> 02:43:35.218]  You're a Nazi though, for that to work out.
[02:43:35.578 --> 02:43:36.139]  Exactly.
[02:43:36.339 --> 02:43:38.580]  Because you're against Nazis, you're a Nazi.
[02:43:38.780 --> 02:43:40.621]  But if you're a Nazi, then you're anti-Nazi.
[02:43:40.921 --> 02:43:41.161]  Yeah.
[02:43:42.281 --> 02:43:45.143]  But have you heard about the push to get Mel Gibson to run for President?
[02:43:45.723 --> 02:43:45.963]  Yeah.
[02:43:47.164 --> 02:43:49.825]  Yeah, I think that would be a good idea too.
[02:43:50.045 --> 02:43:51.206]  Yeah, a lot better than Arnold.
[02:43:51.226 --> 02:43:55.167]  Well, he was born in New York, upstate New York, so he's an American.
[02:43:56.048 --> 02:43:56.608]  Hey Alec?
[02:43:56.888 --> 02:43:57.168]  Yes?
[02:43:57.348 --> 02:43:58.409]  I've got a question for you.
[02:43:59.470 --> 02:44:05.995]  A couple weeks ago I was preaching about this in my church about the New World Order and the Illuminati and all that.
[02:44:06.435 --> 02:44:06.695]  Yes.
[02:44:06.856 --> 02:44:12.239]  And they said... See, we got a couple of Masons in our church.
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:14.421]  Oh, and they said you were a devil because you were against it?
[02:44:14.661 --> 02:44:15.282]  No, no.
[02:44:15.382 --> 02:44:21.366]  They said if I keep on preaching on that, I'm going to split that church wide open.
[02:44:21.386 --> 02:44:23.547]  Oh, you're bad for bringing it up.
[02:44:23.808 --> 02:44:24.728]  I left the church.
[02:44:24.948 --> 02:44:27.010]  We even got a cop in there that's a Mason.
[02:44:28.539 --> 02:44:30.440]  And they were telling you don't talk about the New World Order.
[02:44:30.761 --> 02:44:31.001]  No.
[02:44:31.521 --> 02:44:42.488]  And it's... The planet states in the Bible when the ten nations get together in Revelation, that's going to become a New World Order, One World Government right there.
[02:44:42.808 --> 02:44:44.750]  And they do not want to hear nothing about that.
[02:44:44.950 --> 02:44:47.551]  Well, you're not supposed to talk about the New World Order, thanks to McColl.
[02:44:47.972 --> 02:44:48.192]  Okay.
[02:44:48.212 --> 02:44:54.316]  You know, all these presidents and prime ministers talk about it and call for it, but then if you talk about it, it's code for evil.
[02:44:54.636 --> 02:44:55.436]  It doesn't exist.
[02:44:55.476 --> 02:44:57.238]  Paul, they even have psychological
[02:45:00.056 --> 02:45:03.337]  Names for the insanity of believing in a world government, Paul.
[02:45:04.797 --> 02:45:07.018]  Yeah, I've heard some of those definitions.
[02:45:09.138 --> 02:45:21.061]  Going back to the church thing, I mean, it says in the Bible, and I think Jesus said it, that worship is not mindless repetition of chapters and verses, and yet that's what we see in our churches today.
[02:45:22.341 --> 02:45:26.082]  The old school kind of churches would be political, but now it's with these
[02:45:27.202 --> 02:45:27.742]  Hey Alex?
[02:45:27.802 --> 02:45:29.163]  One more thing before I go.
[02:45:29.263 --> 02:45:30.925]  I just got one more thing.
[02:45:30.945 --> 02:45:32.325]  I guess you heard it on the ref.
[02:45:32.366 --> 02:45:33.266]  Hulk Hogan said that
[02:45:50.109 --> 02:45:53.070]  What you gonna do when Alex Jones runs on you, brother?
[02:45:53.430 --> 02:45:56.190]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:45:56.270 --> 02:45:57.190]  I appreciate it.
[02:45:57.230 --> 02:45:57.971]  Final call.
[02:45:58.111 --> 02:45:59.611]  Phil in Virginia, go ahead.
[02:46:01.991 --> 02:46:11.633]  Yes, I'd like to take a phrase that the Trader's Coward, Sean Insanity, has been using and say that Alex Jones, you're a great American.
[02:46:12.314 --> 02:46:14.414]  Paul Watson, you're a great Englishman.
[02:46:15.075 --> 02:46:18.637]  And your previous caller, he is a great American also.
[02:46:18.958 --> 02:46:22.640]  He did write to get out of these spiritual whorehouses called churches.
[02:46:23.801 --> 02:46:42.132]  But the Messiah said he did not come to bring peace but a sword to bring division and to point out what you stand on the ground of what is right and what is wrong and he was right to do that to expose that evil which is known as Freemasonry.
[02:46:42.964 --> 02:46:46.207]  And he was tortured to death, but they now tell us that torture is good.
[02:46:46.968 --> 02:46:48.349]  Oh yeah.
[02:46:48.369 --> 02:46:50.771]  That's the new reality.
[02:46:51.211 --> 02:46:54.414]  Alex, I've got to say, I appreciate your sense of humor.
[02:46:55.054 --> 02:47:03.822]  And it is good to be able to still laugh and have a sense of humor in all of this depressing
[02:47:04.369 --> 02:47:04.849]  Uh, news.
[02:47:05.069 --> 02:47:27.776]  But yesterday, there was another despicable display of demonic perversion, and I'm not talking about the long-festering cancer of the secret Babylon, the great mother of harlots and abominations of the earth, but about the latest result of problem-reaction-solution, which was the headline of the local syndicated government propaganda paper, Virginian Pilot.
[02:47:28.096 --> 02:47:30.477]  Uh, either one of you guys want to take a stab at what it was?
[02:47:31.277 --> 02:47:32.037]  No, what was it?
[02:47:32.377 --> 02:47:32.658]  U.S.
[02:47:32.698 --> 02:47:33.898]  clamps down on borders.
[02:47:35.825 --> 02:47:38.826]  When it really doesn't clamp down on the borders, it clamps down on the citizens.
[02:47:39.146 --> 02:47:39.686]  Exactly.
[02:47:40.246 --> 02:47:42.847]  Passports will be needed to tighten security.
[02:47:42.887 --> 02:47:45.827]  That's the, uh... This is unbelievable.
[02:47:46.748 --> 02:47:48.188]  Good is evil and evil is good.
[02:47:48.668 --> 02:47:49.988]  Up is down, down is up.
[02:47:50.048 --> 02:47:51.149]  Thanks for the call, Bill.
[02:47:51.609 --> 02:47:52.409]  Uh, comments, Paul?
[02:47:53.109 --> 02:47:56.970]  Well, we talked about the Fallujans needing an ID card to get back into their town.
[02:47:56.990 --> 02:47:58.610]  And that's what it is.
[02:47:59.030 --> 02:48:05.272]  Canadian citizens, American citizens leave the country and need a photo ID, uh, ID card to get back in.
[02:48:06.394 --> 02:48:07.975]  Same system as they're using in Iraq.
[02:48:08.215 --> 02:48:09.556]  With a transponder chip?
[02:48:10.077 --> 02:48:10.237]  Yep.
[02:48:10.777 --> 02:48:13.279]  It's not just that it's the photo ID isn't good enough now.
[02:48:13.339 --> 02:48:14.359]  Now it's more!
[02:48:16.061 --> 02:48:18.382]  But we'll accept a consular matricula to get you into the country.
[02:48:18.982 --> 02:48:20.123]  If you're an illegal alien.
[02:48:20.263 --> 02:48:22.925]  Or we'll pay under the amnesty plan to bring you here.
[02:48:22.945 --> 02:48:27.408]  Paul, let's blitz through some final news on the other side.
[02:48:28.149 --> 02:48:30.070]  And wrap up this Thursday edition.
[02:48:32.179 --> 02:48:34.082]  I'm Real Talk Radio, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:34.162 --> 02:48:38.128]  Real issues of real significance that actually affect you and your family.
[02:48:38.649 --> 02:48:41.033]  Like the t-shirt Illustrious sent me five years ago.
[02:48:41.053 --> 02:48:42.175]  I'm wearing that t-shirt right now.
[02:48:42.756 --> 02:48:43.497]  Real Talk Radio.
[02:48:45.248 --> 02:48:52.071]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.411 --> 02:48:53.771]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:53.971 --> 02:48:56.172]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.332 --> 02:48:58.413]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:58.693 --> 02:49:03.615]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:03.955 --> 02:49:07.977]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.237 --> 02:49:10.018]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:10.098 --> 02:49:20.762]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.902 --> 02:49:22.782]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:23.002 --> 02:49:26.864]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the info war.
[02:49:26.964 --> 02:49:28.525]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.

[02:49:52.300 --> 02:50:03.209]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:04.690 --> 02:50:08.853]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:09.194 --> 02:50:19.683]  But it's worth every penny because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:19.963 --> 02:50:20.464]  That's right!
[02:50:20.644 --> 02:50:27.750]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.030 --> 02:50:32.153]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:50:46.272 --> 02:50:46.613]  I think so.

[02:51:49.893 --> 02:51:51.794]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:52.274 --> 02:51:55.096]  Alex Jones, on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:51:56.556 --> 02:52:01.259]  Go to prisonplanet.tv, you can watch my new film, Martial Law, my best work there.
[02:52:01.799 --> 02:52:07.382]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions, 15 cents a day, all my videos, books, other videos, it's all there.
[02:52:07.962 --> 02:52:11.344]  Hundreds and hundreds of hours of video, hundreds and hundreds of hours of audio.
[02:52:12.084 --> 02:52:15.486]  Multiple new pieces of media put on there every week.
[02:52:16.146 --> 02:52:19.408]  Orange County Sheriff used driving records to locate Critic,
[02:52:20.094 --> 02:52:21.835]  A woman who wrote a letter to the editor.
[02:52:21.855 --> 02:52:25.656]  He used the database system to find out where she lived and harassed her.
[02:52:25.976 --> 02:52:28.957]  That's WFTV out of Florida.
[02:52:29.337 --> 02:52:31.118]  Boy, that's friendly folks, isn't it?
[02:52:32.218 --> 02:52:37.580]  Just because she said they were overusing tasers, most of the deaths in the country, a large portion are in that area.
[02:52:38.400 --> 02:52:40.801]  And boy, he's going to go after her, Paul.
[02:52:41.934 --> 02:52:52.441]  Well, yeah, I mean, you give this kind of technology to corrupt police, most of which are good, but some of which are corrupt, then they will use it for personal vendettas, like these GPS trackers.
[02:52:52.541 --> 02:52:53.302]  What about this one?
[02:52:53.702 --> 02:52:58.025]  Norwegian government forces 40% female employment or businesses get shut down.
[02:52:58.605 --> 02:53:06.491]  That's forcing women to go to work, forcing women not to take care of their children, forcing people not to have a family so the state can raise the family.
[02:53:06.531 --> 02:53:06.831]  Go ahead.
[02:53:08.064 --> 02:53:12.706]  Well yeah, and in that it doesn't even mention what size the business has to be.
[02:53:13.266 --> 02:53:22.590]  So if you've got a business which employs five people, four of which are men, then the pretext is there to shut that business down.
[02:53:22.670 --> 02:53:24.051]  Yeah, one of its three brothers!
[02:53:25.163 --> 02:53:27.444]  I mean, what about being able to hire who you want to hire?
[02:53:27.984 --> 02:53:29.704]  And women are great employees.
[02:53:29.724 --> 02:53:31.065]  I mean, most of my employees are women.
[02:53:31.085 --> 02:53:36.826]  I don't have that many, but I mean, I'm actually, you know, I guess discriminating against men.
[02:53:36.846 --> 02:53:41.608]  I found women, in many cases, tend to be better than men in many respects.
[02:53:41.908 --> 02:53:43.748]  But I mean, what's the deal here?
[02:53:44.368 --> 02:53:45.909]  This is forcing women into this.
[02:53:47.481 --> 02:53:56.087]  Well, I mean, if you know anything about Scandinavian countries, it is completely PC gone mad, so it would be no surprise to some of the people up there.
[02:53:56.827 --> 02:54:04.072]  But, yeah, it's indentured servitude, and it's forcing businesses to conform to government regulations.
[02:54:05.813 --> 02:54:09.895]  Boy, you talk about the Soviet Union, but it's liberal, so it's okay, and it's coming here, too.
[02:54:10.316 --> 02:54:12.237]  Japantown gets a real robocop.
[02:54:12.897 --> 02:54:14.078]  This is out of the Mail and Guardian.
[02:54:15.339 --> 02:54:18.621]  And we have a flashback, future police state use of robots.
[02:54:19.281 --> 02:54:27.785]  The safety of Japanese neighborhood was Wednesday put in the hands briefly of a robot, which became police chief of the day in the campaign to promote safe driving.
[02:54:28.745 --> 02:54:37.490]  And half the military in 2010 will be ground robots and air robots, and a few globalists then can take control, Paul.
[02:54:38.390 --> 02:54:44.073]  Well yeah, and they've already done tests with Honda and the Japanese government using this
[02:54:45.516 --> 02:54:56.941]  Affio robot to have it fitted with a taser whereby anyone entering the restricted area which would be judged by an RFID tag on the robot would be tasered.
[02:54:56.981 --> 02:55:00.743]  So they're looking at law enforcement applications for robots now.
[02:55:02.623 --> 02:55:03.424]  All part of freedom!
[02:55:04.364 --> 02:55:05.545]  We're out of time, Paul.
[02:55:05.865 --> 02:55:07.986]  The new film, Martial Law.
[02:55:08.746 --> 02:55:10.767]  Give us a 30 second plug, your take on the film.
[02:55:12.262 --> 02:55:13.183]  It's well defined.
[02:55:13.223 --> 02:55:19.753]  It covers all the vital aspects of New World Order in three bite-sized chunks.
[02:55:19.773 --> 02:55:22.858]  9-11 is covered in depth, new information on that.
[02:55:23.579 --> 02:55:25.943]  And it's over three hours long.
[02:55:27.330 --> 02:55:28.511]  3 hours long on DVD.
[02:55:28.951 --> 02:55:31.492]  2 hours 35 minutes on VHS DVD now available.

[02:55:47.741 --> 02:55:48.402]  It won't be seen.
[02:55:48.442 --> 02:55:50.023]  If you don't get it and make copies, please do.
[02:55:50.703 --> 02:55:53.466]  We're going to prisonplanet.tv to watch it online right now.
[02:55:53.807 --> 02:55:58.973]  And Paul, we've already got large sections of it up for free, but you're going to be putting some more clips up for free, aren't you?
[02:55:58.993 --> 02:56:07.923]  Yeah, we're going to be putting a clip which focuses on Schwarzenegger up later on tonight to add to the three clips which are already up there free to everybody.
[02:56:08.463 --> 02:56:10.445]  Alright, go to PrisonPlanet.tv and check it out.
[02:56:10.545 --> 02:56:12.266]  Paul, always great to have you on.
[02:56:12.707 --> 02:56:13.827]  Hopefully have you on next week.
[02:56:14.368 --> 02:56:15.149]  Alright, thanks Alex.
[02:56:15.529 --> 02:56:16.089]  Take care.
[02:56:16.730 --> 02:56:18.912]  Again, the new film, I just want it to be seen.
[02:56:18.972 --> 02:56:20.253]  Please help me get it out to people.
[02:56:20.293 --> 02:56:20.813]  Please get it.
[02:56:20.853 --> 02:56:21.654]  Please make copies.
[02:56:21.994 --> 02:56:23.155]  There's only three films in one.
[02:56:23.575 --> 02:56:25.557]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight central.
[02:56:26.317 --> 02:56:29.140]  And I'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:29.180 --> 02:56:31.321]  Now get out there and take on the new world order.
[02:56:31.361 --> 02:56:31.822]  God bless.
