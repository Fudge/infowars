[00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.050]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.731 --> 00:00:07.791]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.491 --> 00:00:09.632]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.272 --> 00:00:11.073]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:12.734]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:17.076]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.576 --> 00:00:21.658]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:40.145]  Welcome, my friends, to this Thursday, 22nd day of September, 2005 edition.
[00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:42.387]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.407 --> 00:00:44.428]  We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:57.879]  I had a great guest coming on in the second hour to talk about 9-11 and more cover-ups by the government, more connections with the CIA and Muhammad Atta.
[00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.361]  But I want to be fair to that guest, so I'm going to try to move him to next week
[00:01:02.958 --> 00:01:05.619]  Because we need to talk about Hurricane Rita.
[00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:09.120]  We need to get into what's happening with the economy.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:20.584]  We need to cover the latest incident of British troops being caught carrying out terrorist operations dressed as Arabs, red-handed in Basra.
[00:01:21.204 --> 00:01:25.406]  And we do have Jack McClam, police and military, against the New World Order.
[00:01:25.426 --> 00:01:31.448]  This is talking about this whole police state situation coming up in the third hour.
[00:01:31.468 --> 00:01:32.488]  So he will be joining us
[00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:39.232]  So much to cover today.
[00:01:39.392 --> 00:01:42.813]  So much to go over.
[00:01:43.914 --> 00:01:46.535]  Storm triggers mass evacuations.
[00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:49.336]  More than 1 million people have begun to evacuate the Gulf Coast.
[00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:50.737]  It's more than that.
[00:01:50.777 --> 00:01:53.398]  There's 5 million people in the Houston metro area.
[00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.930]  And the highways are completely jammed.
[00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.911]  I mean, yesterday, there's so many people already in Austin that a trip that takes 20 minutes took me over an hour.
[00:02:05.332 --> 00:02:09.412]  The storm peaked out last night at about 175 miles per hour.
[00:02:09.772 --> 00:02:11.473]  That is a very strong Category 5.
[00:02:12.313 --> 00:02:13.193]  A mega storm.
[00:02:13.713 --> 00:02:16.834]  And it slowed down to about 170 miles an hour still.
[00:02:17.334 --> 00:02:19.134]  A strong Category 5.
[00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:20.654]  That's 280 kilometers an hour.
[00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:21.034]  And its track...
[00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:26.692]  Altered slightly.
[00:02:26.712 --> 00:02:31.675]  It was going to go straight into Port Aransas as the center of the eye.
[00:02:32.196 --> 00:02:46.305]  Now it's adjusted to an even more devastating angle right on an exact precision beeline course for the largest city in Texas, Houston.
[00:02:47.906 --> 00:02:51.549]  It's going right up into the chip channel itself.
[00:02:52.461 --> 00:02:58.085]  Where there are literally scores of refineries and huge container docks.
[00:02:59.706 --> 00:03:08.693]  It is chemical plants, as far as the eye can see, that routinely blow up on their own accord, much less without the help of a hurricane.
[00:03:10.454 --> 00:03:11.555]  And I keep saying 1909.
[00:03:14.016 --> 00:03:15.938]  And I get my history wrong sometimes.
[00:03:16.718 --> 00:03:19.980]  Galveston was hit in 1900, and in 1909 they finished the seawall
[00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:26.997]  I was down there a few months ago and saw the plaque that said 1909.
[00:03:27.037 --> 00:03:30.438]  I kept mixing it up in my head with 1900.
[00:03:30.878 --> 00:03:33.019]  1900, and it killed 9,000 people.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.320]  Well, somehow I came up with the number of 1909.
[00:03:36.101 --> 00:03:37.501]  I apologize.
[00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.442]  I make mistakes here.
[00:03:39.122 --> 00:03:50.447]  But regardless, in 1900, the entire island of Galveston was under 20 feet of water from a hurricane that came out of nowhere because they didn't have Doppler radar and satellites then.
[00:03:51.327 --> 00:03:51.848]  And it killed...
[00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.139]  The history books say between 9,000 and 14,000.
[00:03:55.499 --> 00:03:57.780]  No one really knows.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.160]  In Katrina right now, the death toll is up at around 900.
[00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:09.062]  So, yes, if you live in Galveston, if you live in Houston, you better get out of there.
[00:04:09.642 --> 00:04:12.302]  Unless you live in an armored compound.
[00:04:13.842 --> 00:04:14.923]  Well above sea level.
[00:04:15.423 --> 00:04:19.363]  Now, Houston is above sea level itself, but only a few feet.
[00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:22.684]  And it has flooded in the past large areas of the city.
[00:04:23.624 --> 00:04:25.346]  So quite a hurricane season.
[00:04:26.286 --> 00:04:31.170]  And you know, I've not wanted to think that this is some type of weather modification or weather war situation.
[00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:42.340]  We have had big hurricanes in the past, but it's very suspicious how five, six days ago it was in the Atlantic and they said it's going to hit Houston.
[00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:46.283]  And the computer models have never been this accurate.
[00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.355]  And they're saying right where it's going to hit, and now it looks like that's where it's going.
[00:04:50.795 --> 00:04:52.819]  And it could flood New Orleans as well.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.403]  All the details when we get back.
[00:04:55.943 --> 00:04:58.788]  They're up on InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com right now.
[00:05:02.361 --> 00:05:05.222]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:06.183]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.263 --> 00:05:07.063]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.403 --> 00:05:12.066]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.406 --> 00:05:19.149]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:21.451]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.671 --> 00:05:24.513]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.593 --> 00:05:29.276]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.457 --> 00:05:33.900]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:41.345]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.586 --> 00:05:44.007]  Discover the documentary truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.168 --> 00:05:45.909]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:46.049 --> 00:05:52.054]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[00:05:52.134 --> 00:05:59.039]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:01.408 --> 00:06:04.870]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.651]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:08.731 --> 00:06:12.673]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.893 --> 00:06:19.056]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.476 --> 00:06:27.380]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:33.122]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:33.282 --> 00:06:37.063]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.423 --> 00:06:39.283]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:06:39.343 --> 00:06:41.524]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:41.744 --> 00:06:46.325]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91, or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:06:46.385 --> 00:06:50.846]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4400.
[00:06:52.947 --> 00:07:03.850]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:09.012]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:07:09.252 --> 00:07:15.414]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:07:15.694 --> 00:07:21.336]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:07:21.596 --> 00:07:27.100]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and the Garicus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:31.182]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:07:31.202 --> 00:07:36.466]  A one-month supply of the Garicus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:07:36.486 --> 00:07:36.646]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:07:36.666 --> 00:07:37.526]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.672]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:07:47.872 --> 00:07:50.793]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[00:07:50.993 --> 00:07:55.896]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[00:07:56.116 --> 00:07:58.437]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:08:05.729 --> 00:08:06.390]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:08.091]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.811 --> 00:08:09.952]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.593 --> 00:08:11.393]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.154 --> 00:08:13.655]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.715 --> 00:08:17.398]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.898 --> 00:08:22.001]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:32.333 --> 00:08:40.598]  Well, let me tell you what it's like to be in Central Texas, about 110 miles from the coast.
[00:08:41.718 --> 00:08:59.168]  The highways are all jam-packed with cars going one way, that is north, from Houston with 5 million people in the metro area to the long line of cities and towns, over a million other people.
[00:09:00.612 --> 00:09:23.279]  Outside of Houston and the Storm's Path, they're all attempting to go to San Antonio, Austin, Texas, Dallas, Texas, and obviously there is not the shelters or the hotels or motels available for even a fraction, even a fraction of 6 million people.
[00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:31.719]  But the press is only reporting that about a million people have tried to evacuate from Houston.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.426]  And that has caused a total gridlock on the highways.
[00:09:37.586 --> 00:09:40.289]  And all of this can be seen as a microcosm
[00:09:41.121 --> 00:09:50.366]  Of what will happen if suitcase nukes go off, or if there is an announcement of the release of a deadly biological pathogen by Al-Ciada.
[00:09:50.886 --> 00:09:54.428]  And the government's been saying not a question of if, but when this is going to happen.
[00:09:55.129 --> 00:09:56.289]  They're fear-mongering.
[00:09:56.309 --> 00:09:59.831]  They're preparing for mass-forced inoculations and mass arrests.
[00:10:00.392 --> 00:10:09.817]  And so we know the government is using these hurricanes as a war game to study how large populations in the United States behave.
[00:10:10.427 --> 00:10:21.352]  Well, we talked about this a few weeks ago, how they were using Katrina for gun confiscation drills and how to lock down cities and how to cut off the command and control systems of local governments.
[00:10:21.672 --> 00:10:26.655]  And now FEMA has even admitted that they used it as a war game.
[00:10:28.696 --> 00:10:32.538]  But I'm not saying things aren't going to be bad.
[00:10:32.818 --> 00:10:39.461]  But some of these people that are saying total devastation, this could trigger a depression...
[00:10:40.713 --> 00:10:44.536]  This could cause $6 a gallon gas.
[00:10:45.697 --> 00:10:48.379]  This could flood all of Houston.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:51.642]  Basically, it's all over.
[00:10:52.122 --> 00:10:53.163]  What are we going to do?
[00:10:53.223 --> 00:10:55.345]  Let's run around pulling our hair out.
[00:10:56.365 --> 00:10:58.867]  I'm not saying that.
[00:10:58.887 --> 00:11:05.412]  Houston is not 20 feet below sea level like the central areas of New Orleans were and is.
[00:11:06.973 --> 00:11:10.256]  Houston is, what, 4 or 5 feet above sea level.
[00:11:12.569 --> 00:11:13.709]  Some areas even higher.
[00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:15.910]  That doesn't mean that it doesn't flood.
[00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:18.031]  It floods, and it floods big time.
[00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:20.971]  I've got a lot of friends and family that live in Houston.
[00:11:21.632 --> 00:11:26.173]  Every five or six years, they get flooded, even if they're on supposedly high ground.
[00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:40.517]  So, if Hurricane Katrina doesn't slow, if Hurricane Katrina continues to build up moisture out of the hot gulf, we're looking at massive flooding and serious devastation.
[00:11:41.624 --> 00:11:56.390]  Because right now it is looking like it's going to go right up into the giant ship channel where there are thousands of ships and freighters and tankers and scores of chemical plants and refineries.
[00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:01.632]  I mean, it is from Texas City up into Houston down to Corpus Christi.
[00:12:01.732 --> 00:12:10.576]  It is just solid refineries, solid ammonia plants and every other type of plant, fertilizer plants.
[00:12:11.804 --> 00:12:15.305]  Steel mills, just a giant industrial park.
[00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:26.430]  One of the few areas in the United States that still got jobs and still got factories and still got refineries and still producing something.
[00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:33.112]  One of the other areas was the other sectors of the Gulf Coast, Louisiana, Mississippi.
[00:12:33.793 --> 00:12:35.393]  And you know those in Alabama.
[00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.094]  Those were devastated.
[00:12:38.334 --> 00:12:39.715]  They were decimated.
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.921]  Just ravaged wholesale.
[00:12:45.022 --> 00:12:47.863]  So it is clear that God is not blessing us.
[00:12:47.883 --> 00:12:53.025]  But you've got to remember, folks, that this has happened before.
[00:12:53.185 --> 00:13:01.128]  In 1900, over 9,000 people died in Galveston, Texas alone, the big gambling city.
[00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:06.990]  It was the gambling city at the time, the big prostitution gambling center, one of the largest cities in Texas.
[00:13:09.017 --> 00:13:18.780]  And 9,000, between 9,000 and 14,000, no one knows, but the history books say between 9,000 and 14,000 died, thousands died in Houston, and thousands of others around the Gulf Coast.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:29.744]  So we're looking at a storm bigger than that one barreling towards a direct T-bone attack on Galveston and Houston.
[00:13:30.804 --> 00:13:36.466]  So if you're in Houston, if you're not on high ground and you're not in a big brick house...
[00:13:38.132 --> 00:13:39.433]  You better get out of there.
[00:13:41.674 --> 00:13:43.015]  You're foolish if you don't.
[00:13:43.875 --> 00:13:49.598]  And I know a lot of you don't have money for a hotel, or you don't have family in another area.
[00:13:49.618 --> 00:13:52.100]  A lot of you don't even have cars.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:59.504]  I mean, Houston, you think there's a welfare crowd in New Orleans of a million and a half people in the metro area.
[00:13:59.904 --> 00:14:05.047]  Houston is five million people metro.
[00:14:06.543 --> 00:14:12.165]  It is, what, the fourth or fifth biggest city in the United States.
[00:14:13.345 --> 00:14:21.308]  I mean, it's only rivaled by cities like Los Angeles and Manhattan and Chicago.
[00:14:23.789 --> 00:14:28.290]  And right now, that storm is on a direct line for Houston.
[00:14:30.774 --> 00:14:41.199]  Now, I'm getting a lot of emails, a lot of other talk show hosts are announcing with total certainty that this is the government doing this.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.640]  Or it's the Russians.
[00:14:44.501 --> 00:14:45.801]  Or it's the Japanese.
[00:14:45.882 --> 00:14:50.264]  Or it's a buck-toothed nutria in Venezuela.
[00:14:51.664 --> 00:14:55.446]  Folks, that really makes us all look like fools.
[00:14:56.507 --> 00:14:58.808]  It makes us look like a tinfoil hat crowd.
[00:14:59.358 --> 00:15:03.662]  We have to be scientific about this.
[00:15:05.463 --> 00:15:13.831]  Does our criminal government have the means to control the weather and to steer and worsen hurricanes?
[00:15:15.873 --> 00:15:17.414]  Yes, they do.
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:28.743]  Did Secretary of Defense Cohen in 97 in a Pentagon public briefing say that the biggest threat facing us is terrorists with weather weapons?
[00:15:29.363 --> 00:15:29.784]  Yes.
[00:15:31.484 --> 00:15:34.905]  Were there bills introduced in the last three years to restrict weather weapons?
[00:15:34.965 --> 00:15:38.567]  Does our government admit they have tectonic and volcanic weapons?
[00:15:39.707 --> 00:15:45.549]  Did the mainstream papers admit that there were tsunami bombs in the mid-1940s?
[00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:45.629]  Yes.
[00:15:49.167 --> 00:15:50.748]  Can this stuff be created?
[00:15:50.848 --> 00:15:51.809]  Can it be triggered?
[00:15:51.929 --> 00:15:52.370]  Yes.
[00:15:53.871 --> 00:16:12.106]  But the fact that these things exist and the leap to the government is doing it that connection can be made but you cannot unequivocally authoritatively state that.
[00:16:12.526 --> 00:16:14.508]  We have to be above reproach.
[00:16:15.649 --> 00:16:17.010]  We have to be accurate.
[00:16:18.234 --> 00:16:22.537]  We have to tell it like it is and not embellish.
[00:16:24.077 --> 00:16:29.761]  I get accused of that all the time just because the stuff we talk about is so amazing people can't believe it even when it's admitted.
[00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:39.006]  Like the Chinese government has mobile execution vans where they kill you for stealing a loaf of bread and hang you up by your ankles and strip your skin off and sell it to American housewives.
[00:16:40.854 --> 00:16:42.814]  State Department of Taxes says it isn't true.
[00:16:43.155 --> 00:16:48.176]  Meanwhile, the Chinese government is advertising and saying, of course we do, it's no big deal, and showing photographs of it.
[00:16:49.156 --> 00:16:50.456]  We're posting more of that today.
[00:16:54.037 --> 00:16:58.218]  So people have trouble with the Pentagon plan to forcibly put a chip in your brain.
[00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:01.018]  I mean, the Pentagon plan is official and public.
[00:17:01.038 --> 00:17:04.339]  I mean, they're not going to stop with just chips under your skin.
[00:17:06.199 --> 00:17:08.480]  See, people have trouble dealing with that.
[00:17:09.102 --> 00:17:12.084]  But it's admitted, so I can talk about it.
[00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:31.719]  Clearly it's suspicious that they could say that when Hurricane Rita was still in the Atlantic Ocean, they were saying, I remember hearing them six days ago saying it'll probably hit Houston, probably hit Galveston.
[00:17:31.739 --> 00:17:38.344]  For those who don't know, Galveston is an island off the coast right in front of Houston.
[00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:40.215]  20 minutes from Houston.
[00:17:43.257 --> 00:18:02.667]  And then to watch that sucker come right around, through the Keys, right past Cuba, and aim straight at Houston, when I have, I mean, I find hurricanes to be interesting and the weather to be interesting, and a few times a week I always click on things and look at the weather and look at satellites, and I've looked at tracks in the past, you know, we get hurricanes every year here in Texas.
[00:18:03.602 --> 00:18:05.423]  And folks, they're always wrong.
[00:18:05.563 --> 00:18:07.984]  I mean, they're never right about exactly where it's going to hit.
[00:18:08.344 --> 00:18:11.546]  How are they magically right about the last two hurricanes?
[00:18:15.587 --> 00:18:17.949]  And the water is so hot, folks.
[00:18:18.009 --> 00:18:21.570]  I mean, the water has been like 95, 96 degrees this summer.
[00:18:22.831 --> 00:18:31.355]  It's going to be 103 degrees in Austin, 103 degrees in Houston, 103 degrees, and that's going to make that thing even worse.
[00:18:31.395 --> 00:18:32.115]  Man, when it hits...
[00:18:33.473 --> 00:18:36.676]  I'm no meteorologist, but they're saying horrible tornadoes.
[00:18:37.176 --> 00:18:43.502]  They're saying it's just going to dump a large portion of the Gulf of Mexico on Texas.
[00:18:43.722 --> 00:18:49.086]  And I'm trying to not sit here and fearmonger like the news is doing, but it doesn't look good.
[00:18:49.907 --> 00:18:50.387]  So listen.
[00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:53.190]  Don't take the main roads.
[00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:55.392]  I've been looking at the different traffic reports.
[00:18:56.513 --> 00:18:57.653]  Take some of the side roads.
[00:18:57.694 --> 00:18:59.855]  Those are pretty traffic-y, but still they're not as bad.
[00:19:00.316 --> 00:19:01.717]  And get out of Houston.
[00:19:03.303 --> 00:19:05.485]  And if you have to, you should have.
[00:19:05.625 --> 00:19:07.967]  Now people are trying to go to the grocery stores.
[00:19:09.449 --> 00:19:11.230]  We were at the grocery store this morning.
[00:19:11.471 --> 00:19:12.091]  No water.
[00:19:12.251 --> 00:19:13.833]  Most of the food grabbed off the shelves.
[00:19:14.293 --> 00:19:15.254]  People are panicking.
[00:19:15.634 --> 00:19:18.517]  When Austin isn't even going to get hit by the hurricane now, it looks like.
[00:19:19.738 --> 00:19:20.419]  That could change.
[00:19:20.459 --> 00:19:22.641]  It could gyrate back down to the south a few degrees.
[00:19:23.709 --> 00:19:26.251]  But they were talking about 80 mile an hour winds in Austin.
[00:19:26.711 --> 00:19:31.434]  If that thing comes to ground with 150 mile an hour winds, it's got 170 mile an hour winds right now.
[00:19:31.915 --> 00:19:34.416]  You're talking about massive devastation.
[00:19:35.137 --> 00:19:52.209]  But to look at the psychology, to look at the psychology of people, man, I've got a two-year supply of food, I've got five big burdens, I've got guns, I've got gold, and I know how to skin a buck, I know how to run a trogline,
[00:19:53.999 --> 00:19:54.819]  We'll be right back.
[00:19:54.879 --> 00:19:55.479]  What about you?
[00:19:55.499 --> 00:19:56.420]  You know how to skin a buck?
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:57.920]  You know how to run a trot line?
[00:20:17.725 --> 00:20:18.505]  That's 50% off the regular price.

[00:21:01.644 --> 00:21:03.284]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.404 --> 00:21:07.525]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:07.645 --> 00:21:10.526]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:10.606 --> 00:21:17.328]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:17.508 --> 00:21:20.508]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:20.708 --> 00:21:23.089]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:23.229 --> 00:21:27.790]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:28.611]  We're good to go.
[00:21:53.847 --> 00:22:04.071]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:04.471 --> 00:22:09.954]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:10.534 --> 00:22:11.054]  That's right.
[00:22:11.074 --> 00:22:13.635]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:13.956 --> 00:22:21.119]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:21.659 --> 00:22:22.340]  We're good to go.
[00:22:40.953 --> 00:22:41.353]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.687 --> 00:23:05.570]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:23:05.690 --> 00:23:07.451]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:23:07.511 --> 00:23:08.772]  But not just any water.
[00:23:08.872 --> 00:23:13.075]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:23:13.135 --> 00:23:22.841]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:23:23.001 --> 00:23:23.722]  We're good to go.
[00:23:38.337 --> 00:23:40.419]  For more information, visit rpa-biotech.com or call 1-866-884-9104.
[00:23:40.479 --> 00:23:40.819]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:24:07.595 --> 00:24:22.904]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest A gun on my hip and the right to arrest I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way If you break the law, you'll hear from me, I know
[00:24:23.364 --> 00:24:24.705]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:24.925 --> 00:24:29.989]  Alex Jones here live with continuing Hurricane Rita coverage.
[00:24:30.009 --> 00:24:36.154]  Still covering the aftermath of the police state takeover with Katrina, or Karina as the First Lady calls it.
[00:24:49.835 --> 00:24:50.535]  Welcome back.
[00:24:50.656 --> 00:24:56.079]  But listen, I'm not here shooting my mouth off going, you fools don't know how to skin a buck or run a truck line.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.283]  My point is, the government can't help you, won't help you, wouldn't help you.
[00:25:03.884 --> 00:25:05.905]  It's never going to help you in any meaningful way.
[00:25:06.525 --> 00:25:15.511]  The government admits that most of the people helping the victims of Katrina are churches and private homes and citizens.
[00:25:17.426 --> 00:25:18.447]  FEMA didn't help you.
[00:25:18.487 --> 00:25:25.370]  FEMA actually made things worse on purpose to get more funds and control and use the whole thing as a gun confiscation drill.
[00:25:25.850 --> 00:25:35.635]  By the way, the NRA, God bless them, finally doing something good, has actually started suing the federal government over the gun confiscations that are still ongoing.
[00:25:37.156 --> 00:25:40.457]  So we see these people.
[00:25:40.477 --> 00:25:46.160]  I mean, imagine living in a city of 5 million or living in New York with 9 million in all the boroughs.
[00:25:46.815 --> 00:25:57.697]  Maybe even more than 9 million if you count all the cities together there with Brooklyn and Manhattan and Queens and all of it.
[00:25:58.357 --> 00:26:06.459]  But in Harlem... I mean, we're totally disconnected from reality, which is normal even 50 years ago.
[00:26:06.879 --> 00:26:07.860]  Even 30 years ago.
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:09.820]  Everybody canned food.
[00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:10.860]  Everybody had a garden.
[00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:14.521]  Even if you lived in the city of New York, there'd be a community garden where you had a plot.
[00:26:15.747 --> 00:26:18.808]  Everybody was, you know, doing it in their little alleyway in little boxes.
[00:26:19.728 --> 00:26:20.789]  People were into that.
[00:26:20.849 --> 00:26:22.849]  People put up food for emergencies.
[00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:25.490]  People had an escape route to the country.
[00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:27.791]  People were worried about disasters.
[00:26:28.151 --> 00:26:30.772]  People didn't expect the power to always be on.
[00:26:30.792 --> 00:26:33.093]  They didn't expect the government to take care of them.
[00:26:33.593 --> 00:26:39.835]  In fact, when 9,000 plus people died in Galveston, the city was destroyed.
[00:26:39.855 --> 00:26:41.055]  I mean, I've seen photos of it.
[00:26:41.075 --> 00:26:41.876]  Just nothing there.
[00:26:42.276 --> 00:26:43.136]  Piles of wood.
[00:26:44.474 --> 00:26:49.598]  When Houston was decimated by that hurricane in 1900, the government did absolutely nothing.
[00:26:50.359 --> 00:26:56.384]  The people got together with the counties, Houston and the city of New Orleans.
[00:26:57.125 --> 00:26:57.585]  Got together.
[00:26:57.605 --> 00:26:58.706]  Many other cities got together.
[00:26:59.066 --> 00:27:02.429]  And they built seawalls and levees all over the coast.
[00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:06.471]  And they built the big 20-foot seawall in Galveston, Texas.
[00:27:06.631 --> 00:27:08.032]  And the county built that.
[00:27:08.052 --> 00:27:10.114]  And they had public works projects.
[00:27:10.194 --> 00:27:11.455]  And people donated.
[00:27:11.495 --> 00:27:15.117]  And they got it built and opened it in 1909, nine years later.
[00:27:17.379 --> 00:27:26.585]  But now we've got to spend $200 billion to give select contracts to Halliburton and Bechtel and Titan and ISI.
[00:27:27.518 --> 00:27:31.720]  Blackwater and almost all the contracts are being given to Bush cronies.
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:35.461]  But he gave a speech saying it would be given to locals.
[00:27:36.242 --> 00:27:38.022]  Again, don't listen to what they say.
[00:27:38.242 --> 00:27:39.303]  Watch what they do.
[00:27:40.844 --> 00:27:45.045]  And a lot of economists and others are just saying we're in deep trouble.
[00:27:46.626 --> 00:27:55.830]  Reuters is reporting that Valero Energy Corporation, Rita may be national disaster, oil CEO says, the biggest oil refiner in the U.S.,
[00:27:56.906 --> 00:28:02.409]  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Bill Grehe said Hurricane Rita's impact on U.S.
[00:28:02.469 --> 00:28:06.632]  crude oil production and refining could be a national disaster.
[00:28:06.652 --> 00:28:10.434]  And, of course, they'll all stand to gain to make more money off making statements like that.
[00:28:10.894 --> 00:28:14.216]  But, quite frankly, it is getting serious.
[00:28:14.296 --> 00:28:19.139]  I mean, with the stuff wiped out in the other Gulf area and now here, if it happens.
[00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:25.062]  If it hits the refineries and we're short refining capacity, that's exactly where it's going.
[00:28:25.714 --> 00:28:28.896]  That's exactly where it's going, as if it was being aimed, folks.
[00:28:29.437 --> 00:28:38.624]  If it hits the refineries with short refining capacity, you're going to see gasoline prices well over $3 a gallon at the pump, he said in a Tuesday night interview.
[00:28:39.064 --> 00:28:41.406]  Folks, it's already $3 a gallon here in Austin.
[00:28:41.906 --> 00:28:42.867]  And what are you talking about?
[00:28:44.488 --> 00:28:47.611]  And remember, just three years ago, two and a half years ago, it was $1.50.
[00:28:47.651 --> 00:28:49.772]  And you thought that was high.
[00:28:50.173 --> 00:28:51.233]  Just five years ago, it was $1.00.
[00:28:52.808 --> 00:28:53.808]  You're being trained, folks.
[00:28:53.848 --> 00:28:56.029]  It's going to probably stop around $5 a gallon.
[00:28:57.189 --> 00:28:59.270]  The Bilderberg Group said that earlier this year.
[00:28:59.310 --> 00:29:00.870]  They said you're going to be paying $8 a gallon.
[00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:01.790]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[00:29:02.931 --> 00:29:04.631]  But they are the bosses, so they know.
[00:29:04.811 --> 00:29:06.211]  Valero became the largest U.S.
[00:29:06.291 --> 00:29:11.173]  refiner earlier this year when it completed the purchase of Primcor, Inc.
[00:29:11.613 --> 00:29:20.855]  Valero operates refineries in Port Arthur, Houston, Texas City, and Corpus Christi, all about to be smashed by Hurricane Rita.
[00:29:21.892 --> 00:29:24.273]  All potentially in the path of Hurricane Rita, the article says.
[00:29:24.874 --> 00:29:26.475]  It's going to be coming across the U.S.
[00:29:26.495 --> 00:29:27.896]  Gulf of Mexico, Greene said.
[00:29:28.316 --> 00:29:29.016]  This is a lot.
[00:29:29.697 --> 00:29:33.719]  That's a lot of oil platforms, oil rigs, natural gas platforms, gas rigs.
[00:29:34.239 --> 00:29:41.403]  It could have a significant impact on oil supplies, prices, and then demanding, depending on, well, we'll come back and finish up.
[00:29:42.104 --> 00:29:43.365]  Then I'll get into a bunch of other news.
[00:29:43.385 --> 00:29:44.265]  We'll take your calls.
[00:29:44.285 --> 00:29:44.825]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:44.845 --> 00:29:46.386]  Bracing from Texas for Hurricane Rita.
[00:29:51.579 --> 00:29:52.481]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.981 --> 00:29:54.584]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.505 --> 00:29:58.190]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:02.071 --> 00:31:05.655]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.695 --> 00:31:06.196]  are located?
[00:31:06.396 --> 00:31:09.801]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:32:02.438 --> 00:32:05.940]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:07.601]  A hot dog was a nickel.
[00:32:07.841 --> 00:32:10.342]  And a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[00:32:10.922 --> 00:32:12.243]  What happened to those prices?
[00:32:12.783 --> 00:32:14.484]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[00:32:16.065 --> 00:32:22.048]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[00:32:22.488 --> 00:32:23.028]  The result?
[00:32:23.468 --> 00:32:24.729]  Inflation was born.
[00:32:25.249 --> 00:32:27.310]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[00:32:29.131 --> 00:32:30.775]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[00:32:33.749 --> 00:32:39.094]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[00:32:39.514 --> 00:32:44.699]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[00:32:45.119 --> 00:32:47.622]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[00:32:47.642 --> 00:32:49.543]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[00:32:49.563 --> 00:32:52.546]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now.
[00:33:10.852 --> 00:33:22.615]  The refineries in Houston and Texas City process 2.3 million barrels of crude oil, or 13.5% of daily U.S.
[00:33:23.136 --> 00:33:24.436]  refining capacity.
[00:33:24.456 --> 00:33:35.219]  The Beaumont-Port Arthur Texas refineries amount to another 1.1 million barrels in refining capacity, or roughly another 5% of U.S.
[00:33:35.239 --> 00:33:35.639]  usage.
[00:33:39.454 --> 00:33:43.555]  For a total of about 18% of U.S.
[00:33:43.735 --> 00:33:52.157]  daily consumption of oil being refined, and that's just Port Arthur and the Houston and Texas City areas.
[00:33:53.157 --> 00:34:05.840]  Then you've got another 10% or so being refined in other areas of the Texas Gulf Coast region, bringing us almost up to 30% of national refining capacity.
[00:34:07.516 --> 00:34:19.484]  Which makes what happened in the more eastern areas of the Gulf pale in significance when you talk about refining problems.
[00:34:20.345 --> 00:34:21.905]  This is huge, folks.
[00:34:22.365 --> 00:34:44.309]  And see, so much more of that refining has shifted over to these plants that are already maxed out in Texas, and so much of that shipping from the damaged ports in New Orleans and surrounding areas in the intercoastal ship channel that's been badly damaged has been shifted over to the intercoastal ship channel in Texas and into the main port area of Houston and Galveston.
[00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:47.090]  I mean, this is just unbelievable.
[00:34:48.422 --> 00:34:50.143]  Sure, it's all a complete coincidence.
[00:34:50.903 --> 00:34:52.544]  No weather control involved.
[00:34:53.705 --> 00:34:54.686]  I'm being sarcastic.
[00:34:55.046 --> 00:35:01.089]  It really does stink to high heaven that the feds were predicting six days ago exactly where it would hit.
[00:35:01.650 --> 00:35:02.930]  They haven't been able to do that in the past.
[00:35:03.931 --> 00:35:06.893]  And the government admits they do have hurricane steering systems.
[00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:24.498]  Based on Rita's current forecast path, Texas City, Houston, Port Arthur, and Beaumont could be lashed by high winds and heavy rains from Rita's northeast quadrant, which often packs the highest winds in a hurricane.
[00:35:24.518 --> 00:35:31.882]  So the most deadly area to, again, direct hit on Houston and the intercoastal ship channel mouth.
[00:35:33.314 --> 00:35:35.216]  Frankly, the biggest port in the U.S., folks.
[00:35:35.956 --> 00:35:42.621]  Valero announced on Wednesday morning it would reduce production at its Houston and Texas City refineries to prepare for the hurricane.
[00:35:43.041 --> 00:35:48.425]  You've got refineries that will start shutting down in anticipation of the hurricane, and it takes about a week to turn them back on.
[00:35:48.965 --> 00:35:54.069]  And then, if any of them have permanent damage, we're going to be dependent on imports following Katrina.
[00:35:54.389 --> 00:35:55.790]  This is really serious.
[00:35:58.292 --> 00:36:01.814]  And Chavez is offering us free oils.
[00:36:02.805 --> 00:36:08.928]  He said three weeks ago, as much as you want free, and Bush said, we don't want anything from you.
[00:36:09.448 --> 00:36:10.328]  Well, of course you don't.
[00:36:10.348 --> 00:36:15.951]  You want to jack up prices with your Saudi buddies and some of the others.
[00:36:16.611 --> 00:36:17.652]  You want high prices.
[00:36:18.332 --> 00:36:21.313]  The oil companies are all registering record profits for three years.
[00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:23.474]  And again, that's not free market, folks.
[00:36:23.494 --> 00:36:25.475]  That's a controlled, fraudulent system.
[00:36:25.815 --> 00:36:27.136]  It's basically organized crime.
[00:36:27.956 --> 00:36:31.478]  And Venezuela is offering us as much lavish, sweet, crude...
[00:36:32.621 --> 00:36:35.723]  As we want, basically no refining needed, just a little bit of purification.
[00:36:36.564 --> 00:36:39.606]  Just gasoline coming out of the ground, and they just say, we don't want it!
[00:36:40.987 --> 00:36:46.451]  By the way, it's five cents a gallon, gasoline is, in Venezuela.
[00:36:47.932 --> 00:36:53.316]  And the government is divesting land stolen by some of its more right-wing governments, and giving people title.
[00:36:53.856 --> 00:36:56.318]  Communists don't give you title to lands, folks.
[00:36:57.199 --> 00:37:07.608]  Our government's saying we don't own private property if private robber barons want it, and the evil communist is offering us free fuel and giving the people free land with title.
[00:37:09.550 --> 00:37:10.030]  Okay.
[00:37:11.612 --> 00:37:15.375]  I just thought I'd point that out to everybody, just how evil our government is.
[00:37:17.777 --> 00:37:23.242]  And there's a lot more I could say about this, but I don't know where these millions of people are going to go.
[00:37:24.918 --> 00:37:29.421]  Austin already took 10,000 refugees.
[00:37:29.441 --> 00:37:32.323]  10,000 victims of Katrina.
[00:37:33.343 --> 00:37:36.945]  Houston took how many tens of thousands?
[00:37:36.985 --> 00:37:38.406]  Was it 50,000 or something?
[00:37:39.207 --> 00:37:41.268]  That are still in different shelters.
[00:37:41.308 --> 00:37:45.771]  They took over 150,000 total that they've now gotten into homes in Houston.
[00:37:46.791 --> 00:37:52.775]  So, we got hundreds of thousands of victims of New Orleans disaster.
[00:37:53.797 --> 00:38:00.201]  In other areas of the Gulf, Biloxi and other areas, Biloxi, Mississippi, they're all here.
[00:38:00.741 --> 00:38:02.582]  The hotels are totally jam-packed.
[00:38:03.122 --> 00:38:04.263]  San Antonio's full.
[00:38:05.264 --> 00:38:08.705]  And we had a million people on the roads trying to get out of Houston yesterday.
[00:38:09.006 --> 00:38:10.907]  There's another million trying to get out now.
[00:38:11.327 --> 00:38:16.050]  People may start to panic, they're saying on the news, and the other three million might try to leave.
[00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:18.871]  And there's another million in the other towns trying to get out.
[00:38:21.873 --> 00:38:21.993]  And...
[00:38:22.970 --> 00:38:23.850]  Where are you all going to go?
[00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.331]  You know the feds aren't going to help you.
[00:38:26.411 --> 00:38:31.252]  I mean, are they going to let people just basically stay in tents at the different parks?
[00:38:31.312 --> 00:38:32.012]  That's an idea.
[00:38:33.792 --> 00:38:38.093]  Did anybody... Basically, the news has trained Americans to ask the government what to do.
[00:38:38.113 --> 00:38:42.794]  I don't hear the government saying, pack a tent, get a tent, get a water filter.
[00:38:42.814 --> 00:38:44.534]  It's, oh God, the water's sold out.
[00:38:44.554 --> 00:38:46.034]  The water's sold out.
[00:38:46.074 --> 00:38:47.075]  What are we going to do?
[00:38:47.095 --> 00:38:47.915]  Pull your hair out.
[00:38:47.975 --> 00:38:48.495]  Freak out.
[00:38:51.380 --> 00:38:54.922]  Nowhere do they ever tell you, have water filters, have a tent if you've got to evacuate.
[00:38:54.942 --> 00:38:58.483]  At least you can go to a side of the road if you have to.
[00:38:58.543 --> 00:38:59.924]  Have a month's storable food.
[00:39:00.824 --> 00:39:01.324]  None of that.
[00:39:01.864 --> 00:39:03.605]  Don't have a firearm to protect yourself.
[00:39:03.965 --> 00:39:12.769]  By the way, it's admitted that what stopped a lot of the rioting, what we already got reports of, it's now confirmed in mainstream news, was the armed citizens that stayed behind to guard their homes.
[00:39:13.089 --> 00:39:15.130]  That stopped the looting and stopped the pillaging.
[00:39:16.184 --> 00:39:23.134]  By FEMA, of course, and others who have been caught red-handed stealing, along with the other criminals, just the normal street thugs, non-governmental criminals.
[00:39:24.616 --> 00:39:31.365]  And again, the Second Amendment Foundation and the NRA are suing to stop the gun confiscations.
[00:39:31.405 --> 00:39:32.166]  That is going on.
[00:39:33.539 --> 00:39:43.607]  I wonder, if we have a disaster and flooding in Houston, will they confiscate guns instead of, sorry, no food, no food for you, but we will send people by to take your guns.
[00:39:44.187 --> 00:39:45.568]  I mean, that's the precedent setting.
[00:39:46.028 --> 00:39:47.389]  See, there's so many facets to this.
[00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.532]  Oh, sorry, Port Arthur flooded.
[00:39:50.552 --> 00:39:52.493]  I guess I've got family there.
[00:39:52.513 --> 00:39:53.494]  Will they be confiscated?
[00:39:54.395 --> 00:39:55.716]  Sorry, no food allowed.
[00:39:55.776 --> 00:39:57.457]  You just have to show up at the sports stadiums.
[00:39:58.366 --> 00:40:05.911]  Show up to the buses, and we're not going to bring you food and water, but we will send in armed mercenaries to take your guns.
[00:40:05.971 --> 00:40:07.052]  That's the help we're going to give you.
[00:40:08.213 --> 00:40:09.694]  I'm going to shut up and take some calls.
[00:40:11.115 --> 00:40:16.198]  Listen, I'm really going to give you each about 45 seconds, because I want to be fair, get everybody on.
[00:40:17.019 --> 00:40:21.222]  We're going to take calls and cover a bunch of other news items throughout this hour, the next hour.
[00:40:21.582 --> 00:40:27.286]  Then we've got Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order, coming on to talk about the police state ramifications.
[00:40:28.741 --> 00:40:34.628]  Of all of this, I have a great guest coming on today, an expert on 9-11 and the CIA connections to Mohammed Adda.
[00:40:34.728 --> 00:40:35.469]  I canceled him.
[00:40:35.489 --> 00:40:36.289]  I apologize.
[00:40:38.552 --> 00:40:40.634]  I apologize to Mr. Hicks who was coming on.
[00:40:40.774 --> 00:40:43.838]  It's just that we're going to set him up for next week.
[00:40:43.858 --> 00:40:49.103]  It's just this hurricane is taking precedent, even over government involvement and orchestration of 9-11.
[00:40:50.467 --> 00:41:00.331]  We are going to talk more about the SAS being caught now with more evidence carrying out terror attacks, shooting police and other things in Iraq to blame it on Arabs dressed up as Arabs.
[00:41:00.751 --> 00:41:01.971]  More on that coming out.
[00:41:02.091 --> 00:41:03.051]  Big news story.
[00:41:03.472 --> 00:41:05.332]  We'll talk about that as well with Jack McClam.
[00:41:05.632 --> 00:41:07.853]  Robert in Colorado, you're our first caller.
[00:41:07.893 --> 00:41:08.293]  Go ahead.
[00:41:09.894 --> 00:41:11.074]  Thanks very much for taking my call.
[00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:13.175]  It was a great show as usual.
[00:41:13.235 --> 00:41:15.096]  I never heard of Hurricane Corrina.
[00:41:15.176 --> 00:41:15.756]  When did that hit?
[00:41:17.094 --> 00:41:18.055]  I was being sarcastic.
[00:41:18.475 --> 00:41:18.956]  I knew you were.
[00:41:18.976 --> 00:41:19.696]  That's why I chuckled.
[00:41:20.317 --> 00:41:26.181]  I mean, we all get things wrong, but she's done it on multiple occasions, called it Corrina instead of Katrina.
[00:41:26.201 --> 00:41:27.302]  She did it twice.
[00:41:27.322 --> 00:41:28.903]  I don't know what she's drinking.
[00:41:29.544 --> 00:41:32.966]  Anyway... Well, the news is reporting that Bush has hit the bottle again.
[00:41:32.986 --> 00:41:34.027]  Oh, yeah.
[00:41:34.207 --> 00:41:34.748]  I heard that.
[00:41:34.788 --> 00:41:36.569]  I think he always hit the bottle, though.
[00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:42.414]  I don't know if I... I mean, you don't fall down from a pretzel and have bashes all over both sides of your face.
[00:41:43.328 --> 00:41:44.209]  Unless you're riding a bike.
[00:41:44.669 --> 00:41:47.311]  Well, he clearly had scratches on his face.
[00:41:47.691 --> 00:41:47.892]  Yeah.
[00:41:48.252 --> 00:41:58.260]  I was listening to Peter Boyle today on 630 KHOW here in Denver, and he was talking about, I think it was the National Enquirer, there was a story about that Bush had been drinking.
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:03.043]  He was doubting the validity of the story.
[00:42:03.084 --> 00:42:04.745]  Well, yeah, I doubt the validity, too.
[00:42:05.265 --> 00:42:07.627]  But I don't doubt the validity of him being a drunk.
[00:42:08.528 --> 00:42:09.068]  Well, I don't either.
[00:42:10.169 --> 00:42:12.431]  But listen, I'm not going to sit here and be a hypocrite, folks.
[00:42:13.158 --> 00:42:21.120]  I've never had a drinking problem, but I like to drink, and I've stopped drinking off and on over the years.
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.481]  I mean, I'll have a few beers here and there.
[00:42:23.521 --> 00:42:31.163]  I don't think it's good because it makes you fat, and it may clean your blood vessels out, but it burns your liver out, and I just don't think drinking's good.
[00:42:31.983 --> 00:42:33.244]  If you do it too much, that's true.
[00:42:34.484 --> 00:42:37.745]  You probably already talked about this last week, but just kind of briefly bring up the speed.
[00:42:37.765 --> 00:42:41.706]  What was really going on when Bill Clinton was criticizing Bush publicly?
[00:42:43.226 --> 00:42:44.206]  Well, let me answer that question.
[00:42:44.226 --> 00:42:44.906]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:45.246 --> 00:42:45.447]  Sure.
[00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:52.128]  We've talked a lot about this, but Bill Clinton has launched his global initiative in preparation to become U.N.
[00:42:52.188 --> 00:42:58.870]  Secretary General, and he's got seven of the G8 lined up to agree with him being Secretary General.
[00:42:59.270 --> 00:43:01.810]  The only one of the G8 that hasn't agreed is the United States.
[00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:08.812]  The five-member Security Council has been making moves to change the rules so Clinton could do that.
[00:43:08.872 --> 00:43:09.612]  I mean, this has been in...
[00:43:11.574 --> 00:43:14.375]  I don't know, like five, six major newspapers the last two years.
[00:43:14.435 --> 00:43:17.117]  I mean, he is officially lobbying.
[00:43:17.157 --> 00:43:18.477]  He officially wants the job.
[00:43:19.217 --> 00:43:21.999]  Every time I talk about this, I get emails going, Show me the article!
[00:43:22.479 --> 00:43:23.779]  Well, we posted them a bunch of times.
[00:43:23.819 --> 00:43:27.641]  Just Google Bill Clinton for UN Secretary General.
[00:43:29.142 --> 00:43:30.282]  Google's getting too much power.
[00:43:30.322 --> 00:43:31.363]  We ought to plug somebody else.
[00:43:31.983 --> 00:43:33.284]  What's another one of the big search engines?
[00:43:33.364 --> 00:43:34.464]  Yahoo search engine.
[00:43:34.484 --> 00:43:34.784]  I don't know.
[00:43:35.625 --> 00:43:36.465]  They're almost identical.
[00:43:37.225 --> 00:43:40.807]  But just type it in there, and you'll get the Cincinnati...
[00:43:41.539 --> 00:43:44.301]  You know, Inquirer, and that's not the National Inquirer, folks.
[00:43:44.341 --> 00:43:45.022]  Respect the paper.
[00:43:45.662 --> 00:43:46.703]  You'll get World Net Daily.
[00:43:46.723 --> 00:43:47.604]  You'll get AP.
[00:43:47.624 --> 00:43:48.544]  You'll get Reuters.
[00:43:48.944 --> 00:43:49.945]  You'll get BBC.
[00:43:50.386 --> 00:43:52.027]  Just a few of the articles I've seen on it.
[00:43:53.308 --> 00:43:54.629]  And this will be a double team.
[00:43:55.890 --> 00:44:06.017]  We'll end up having Clinton as Secretary General, and maybe Hillary or Schwarzenegger or Jeb maybe for President, and they'll just coffee in and schedule to leave in the next year.
[00:44:07.398 --> 00:44:09.920]  He barely hung on with that oil for food scandal.
[00:44:10.871 --> 00:44:14.653]  And so it'll be a double team, but they can't have a unified front publicly.
[00:44:15.293 --> 00:44:24.497]  They get more done if they act like they're fighting, then have the exact same agenda, have kind of a WWF wrestling theatrical Shakespearean theater event.
[00:44:24.898 --> 00:44:26.258]  They squabble about a bit.
[00:44:27.259 --> 00:44:32.161]  The whole world is a stage, each of us an actor on it, and then the whole agenda sails through.
[00:44:33.542 --> 00:44:38.223]  I mean, the Clintons and the Bushes have been narcotics traffickers together since the mid-'80s.
[00:44:38.764 --> 00:44:43.605]  I've interviewed multiple CIA officers there unloading the cocaine who witnessed all of this.
[00:44:44.385 --> 00:44:47.306]  And we know Bill Clinton had 11 meetings with Bush Sr.
[00:44:47.326 --> 00:44:48.807]  the year before he announced for president.
[00:44:49.567 --> 00:44:53.568]  And when was George Bush's envoy to the Bilderberg meeting in 1990 in France?
[00:44:57.156 --> 00:44:58.796]  So, I mean, we know this.
[00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:09.279]  And we know that it finally became public for all of you when Bush said, I am not going to let Dan Burton's committee go after Clinton for pardoning cocaine dealers.
[00:45:09.299 --> 00:45:10.799]  I mean, Clinton should have gone to prison for that.
[00:45:11.419 --> 00:45:15.920]  And having Chinese generals in the White House, Bush said, no, no, no, leave them alone.
[00:45:18.701 --> 00:45:23.722]  And, you know, then you've got Clinton praising Bush, Bush praising Clinton.
[00:45:24.890 --> 00:45:25.910]  You've got Bush Sr.
[00:45:25.930 --> 00:45:28.691]  and Clinton in a lip lock, constantly vacationing together.
[00:45:28.991 --> 00:45:31.492]  Before this was all announced with the tsunami a year ago.
[00:45:31.852 --> 00:45:33.272]  Last December, almost a year ago.
[00:45:34.132 --> 00:45:35.453]  December 26th when it happened.
[00:45:36.853 --> 00:45:42.654]  And so all of this is going on, but notice Bush is plunging down to 30% approval rating.
[00:45:43.315 --> 00:45:46.475]  All these conservatives come out against Bush and go, Okay, he's a liberal.
[00:45:47.055 --> 00:45:48.256]  Okay, he's bad news.
[00:45:48.376 --> 00:45:49.536]  Okay, he's big government.
[00:45:49.596 --> 00:45:51.297]  Okay, he's Bill Clinton on steroids.
[00:45:51.937 --> 00:45:53.077]  Tucker Carlson says it.
[00:45:53.763 --> 00:45:55.744]  And suddenly, Bill Clinton comes to the rescue.
[00:45:56.985 --> 00:45:59.466]  They try to freeze us back into our camps.
[00:46:01.988 --> 00:46:04.709]  And so Bill Clinton attacks him as being an evil right-winger.
[00:46:04.770 --> 00:46:15.436]  Suddenly, Bush's approval ratings go up a few points, and suddenly Republicans are, look at how Clinton was led into the Bush circle, and now he's turned on Bush savagely.
[00:46:15.876 --> 00:46:19.118]  Then you look at the World Forum, the Clinton Global Initiative,
[00:46:20.350 --> 00:46:28.176]  Where you've got to sign a pledge, mayors and governors and presidents and prime ministers to implement world government and world taxation by next year.
[00:46:28.456 --> 00:46:30.077]  He says we're behind schedule.
[00:46:30.278 --> 00:46:31.939]  Condoleezza Rice is nodding her head.
[00:46:31.959 --> 00:46:35.261]  A bunch of Bush cabinet are there looking at him as if he's God Almighty.
[00:46:36.502 --> 00:46:37.523]  Clinton's giving orders.
[00:46:37.683 --> 00:46:39.985]  He's been given power by the beast.
[00:46:40.766 --> 00:46:44.127]  He's there giving orders, and they're literally signing their names.
[00:46:44.167 --> 00:46:45.227]  We'll get it done, sir!
[00:46:45.627 --> 00:46:48.148]  They all march out, and Clinton's just like, blah!
[00:46:48.708 --> 00:46:51.428]  Basically, you know, giving a battle roar for world government.
[00:46:52.409 --> 00:47:01.470]  And again, he moves the agenda more towards centralization, more towards command and control, but then make Bush look like a moderate.
[00:47:02.751 --> 00:47:04.451]  This is all totally scripted.
[00:47:04.511 --> 00:47:08.392]  It's a big joke, folks, a big joke on us.
[00:47:09.545 --> 00:47:18.889]  They've got to energize the conservative base that's waking up to Bush not being conservative, who's now seeing there's no difference, not a dime for the difference, now waking up and getting angry.
[00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:21.370]  They've got to freeze us back into our parties.
[00:47:22.131 --> 00:47:31.415]  Get Democrats who have fealty to Clinton to go, okay, I guess global government's good, and I guess the free trade area of the Americas is good, and I guess the global tax is good because Bill Clinton says George Bush is against it.
[00:47:31.675 --> 00:47:33.396]  Meanwhile, George Bush is promoting all of it.
[00:47:36.181 --> 00:47:37.502]  Okay, see, I said I'd take calls.
[00:47:37.582 --> 00:47:39.803]  The guy brings up a very important question.
[00:47:39.903 --> 00:47:41.163]  I ran about it for three minutes.
[00:47:42.224 --> 00:47:44.325]  Johnny in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:47:44.365 --> 00:47:44.965]  Go ahead, Johnny.
[00:47:44.985 --> 00:47:46.126]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[00:47:46.206 --> 00:47:46.426]  Good.
[00:47:47.326 --> 00:47:52.689]  I'm going to carry you a DVD of a movie that came out in June called Oil Storm.
[00:47:53.289 --> 00:47:54.250]  I'm sure you've probably heard of it.
[00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:56.291]  Yeah, line up the promo for that.
[00:47:56.391 --> 00:47:57.251]  Scott, can you find that?
[00:47:57.291 --> 00:47:57.732]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:47:58.852 --> 00:48:04.635]  I watched it last night and almost fell off my chair when I saw Ray Nagin actually in the movie.
[00:48:05.305 --> 00:48:07.907]  Pretending, basically doing exactly what he did in real life.
[00:48:08.547 --> 00:48:20.594]  Well, sir, they have to have a way to publicly plan with everybody, and so they'll publicly have a TV show where the government's going to fly hijacked jets in the World Trade Center and use a drill as the cover for martial law to attack Afghanistan.
[00:48:20.954 --> 00:48:24.476]  And yes, Oil Storm, which I've only seen clips of, please do send it to me.
[00:48:24.696 --> 00:48:26.497]  But they actually put the real mayor in there.
[00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:27.098]  Are they dumb?
[00:48:28.098 --> 00:48:28.318]  No.
[00:48:28.338 --> 00:48:29.159]  They're that stupid.
[00:48:29.479 --> 00:48:32.561]  Their religion says they have to flaunt it.
[00:48:33.341 --> 00:48:34.482]  Well, they flaunted it all right.
[00:48:35.089 --> 00:48:38.711]  I mean, it's exactly what happened, other than a few little minor details.
[00:48:39.431 --> 00:48:42.813]  Look, fables for children always explain this elite.
[00:48:43.313 --> 00:48:49.376]  Rumpelstiltskin, the evil elf, had to, in riddles, tell them what he was going to do.
[00:48:50.268 --> 00:48:58.315]  Genies, you know, you ask for a ton of gold, you better say, put the ton of gold in front of me, or the genie's going to drop the ton of gold on your head.
[00:48:58.895 --> 00:49:04.299]  Vampires have to ask permission, and in a riddle, tell you they're going to drink your blood and kill you.
[00:49:04.319 --> 00:49:07.522]  They have to tell you the truth and convince you to let them in.
[00:49:08.297 --> 00:49:10.878]  Now, again, I'm not saying Rumpelstiltskin or vampires are real.
[00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:15.800]  These are all children's fables to explain how this elite operates, sir.
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.562]  They have to tell you what they're going to do multiple times.
[00:49:21.742 --> 00:49:29.205]  But wouldn't that basically... That's why FEMA had a drill that ended the day the hurricane hit, and then the exact same thing happened.
[00:49:29.485 --> 00:49:36.128]  Okay, but there's no proof that they did it, but the thing is, by making this video, it seems pretty clear, even though there is still no proof.
[00:49:37.583 --> 00:49:39.104]  Well, I mean, we know they have weather control.
[00:49:39.144 --> 00:49:43.305]  We know they can at least stir up and make hurricanes worse and steer them.
[00:49:43.745 --> 00:49:46.426]  And then they do that with special jets that spray.
[00:49:46.786 --> 00:49:53.508]  They do that with these magnetic energizing systems where they will then direct jet streams and gulf streams.
[00:49:53.548 --> 00:49:54.588]  And this is admitted.
[00:49:54.648 --> 00:49:58.250]  I mean, they have bills and laws, and they have a U.N.
[00:49:58.290 --> 00:49:59.090]  law from 76 about it.
[00:50:01.508 --> 00:50:06.671]  Do you remember the 60th anniversary of the Russians beating the Germans a few months ago?
[00:50:06.711 --> 00:50:11.655]  It was raining real hard, and they brought out trucks with big antennas and blasted the sky, and the rain went away?
[00:50:12.195 --> 00:50:12.515]  Yeah.
[00:50:12.635 --> 00:50:13.396]  Remember that on the news?
[00:50:13.436 --> 00:50:15.397]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:15.717 --> 00:50:17.919]  It's pretty obvious, but we cannot say they did it.
[00:50:18.459 --> 00:50:27.025]  Certainly, though, once it hit, once Katrina hit, they cut police communications, jammed police communications, wouldn't let food and water in to cause rioting.
[00:50:27.245 --> 00:50:30.027]  They then say, oh, we've got to get rid of posse commentatus and have martial law.
[00:50:31.531 --> 00:50:32.512]  Send me Oil Storm, though.
[00:50:32.532 --> 00:50:33.172]  I'd appreciate that.
[00:50:33.192 --> 00:50:33.373]  Sure.
[00:50:34.133 --> 00:50:34.573]  God bless.
[00:50:34.593 --> 00:50:37.996]  Yeah, they love to flaunt.
[00:50:38.957 --> 00:50:42.980]  All right, we'll come back and take more calls.
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:44.101]  I'm trying to go quicker now.
[00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:48.104]  You guys just bring up such good points.
[00:50:48.124 --> 00:50:48.424]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:49.085 --> 00:50:51.286]  And we're racing for another biggin' right now.
[00:50:51.306 --> 00:50:52.667]  A biggin'.
[00:50:54.269 --> 00:50:56.851]  presentplanet.tv, infowars.net.
[00:50:56.891 --> 00:50:58.572]  Be sure and check those sites out.

[00:51:02.382 --> 00:51:09.749]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.029 --> 00:51:14.774]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.994 --> 00:51:20.639]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.879 --> 00:51:25.403]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.623 --> 00:51:32.768]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.808 --> 00:51:37.332]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.492 --> 00:51:40.014]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.234 --> 00:51:46.959]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:47.239 --> 00:51:47.500]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:53:38.487 --> 00:53:38.928]  We're good to go.
[00:54:15.375 --> 00:54:35.926]  We're going to go back over all the details and what the aftermath could be of Hurricane Rita hitting the key refinery areas, as well as chemical production, fertilizer production, shipping, the city of 5 million people there in Houston.
[00:54:37.246 --> 00:54:42.289]  More of that in the next hour than a bunch of other key issues, but we'll continue to cover what's happening with Rita.
[00:54:43.274 --> 00:54:46.939]  But the last caller brought up Oil Storm.
[00:54:48.301 --> 00:54:49.844]  Do you have that clip of Oil Storm ready?
[00:54:50.925 --> 00:54:51.706]  Go ahead and roll that.
[00:54:53.669 --> 00:54:55.272]  It has already begun.
[00:54:56.363 --> 00:54:56.843]  Collided.
[00:54:56.883 --> 00:55:00.245]  Hundreds are feared dead with emergency services unable to call.
[00:55:00.325 --> 00:55:01.306]  A chain of events.
[00:55:01.326 --> 00:55:03.347]  A million barrels of oil gone.
[00:55:03.467 --> 00:55:04.628]  That will spark fear.
[00:55:04.868 --> 00:55:06.389]  A killer blow to the economy.
[00:55:06.449 --> 00:55:11.752]  Create panic and result in a catastrophe that will change our lives forever.
[00:55:12.033 --> 00:55:16.335]  Americans didn't realize how fragile their existence was.
[00:55:16.555 --> 00:55:18.056]  An FX original event.
[00:55:18.537 --> 00:55:19.497]  Sunday, June 5th.
[00:55:21.118 --> 00:55:23.279]  America's lifeline has been severed.
[00:55:25.341 --> 00:55:25.581]  So...
[00:55:27.208 --> 00:55:55.349]  We have the Lone Gunman episode that airs four months before 9-11, that was produced six months before 9-11, where a criminal group uses an anti-terror drill as a smoke screen to make NORAD stand down, and during the drill, they were by remote control, hijack a jumbo jet to fly to the World Trade Center to then blame it on Afghanistan.
[00:55:56.787 --> 00:55:58.669]  And we said, the CIA planted this.
[00:55:59.249 --> 00:56:00.650]  This is to condition the public.
[00:56:01.071 --> 00:56:02.232]  It's also their little joke.
[00:56:02.752 --> 00:56:09.397]  And then Dean Hagelin, the star of the show, shows up at my door and says, yes, the CIA would come plant these stories on us.
[00:56:09.818 --> 00:56:14.422]  I've talked to Chris Carter, the writer, and the CIA came and planted this on him at a party in Hollywood.
[00:56:16.103 --> 00:56:17.364]  They would plant lots of stuff on us.
[00:56:18.085 --> 00:56:20.126]  Had video interviews on prisonplanet.tv.
[00:56:21.227 --> 00:56:22.208]  Now, why do they do that?
[00:56:22.308 --> 00:56:24.650]  Because it also creates NSA chatter.
[00:56:25.757 --> 00:56:26.357]  We're good to go.
[00:56:53.101 --> 00:56:56.402]  Which they tell the government and the military that it's a drill.
[00:56:56.462 --> 00:56:57.242]  They stand down.
[00:56:57.562 --> 00:56:59.002]  You do the exact same thing.
[00:57:00.723 --> 00:57:02.583]  Well, why would you have a show like Oil Storm?
[00:57:02.603 --> 00:57:04.484]  Which I haven't seen, but I've read the synopsis of.
[00:57:04.524 --> 00:57:06.164]  And yeah, it's done like a newscast.
[00:57:06.204 --> 00:57:09.325]  It's got Mayor Ray Nagin and all these real people in it.
[00:57:09.725 --> 00:57:10.505]  Why do they do that?
[00:57:10.545 --> 00:57:16.126]  Well, because then it allows FEMA and others to war game the whole thing.
[00:57:16.406 --> 00:57:18.827]  And they admit the government worked with FX on this.
[00:57:19.571 --> 00:57:31.343]  It allows them to war game the whole thing for people to plan it, for people to consult on it, to talk about it, to deal with it, in conjunction with real FEMA drills, so when it happens, they know how to take control.
[00:57:32.465 --> 00:57:34.647]  And again, New Orleans was federalized two and a half years ago.
[00:57:36.491 --> 00:57:38.132]  So there's no debate about who was in control.
[00:57:38.492 --> 00:57:40.833]  Then they jam police communications, they run the whole op.
[00:57:40.893 --> 00:57:47.175]  So it's not just that they like to leave their calling card when they carry out a crime, as all psychopaths like to do.
[00:57:47.855 --> 00:57:48.776]  It's just criminology.
[00:57:49.136 --> 00:57:56.019]  It also allows them to war game and drill all of this and give them plausible deniability if they get caught being involved.
[00:57:56.459 --> 00:57:57.759]  And it's always the M.O.
[00:57:58.299 --> 00:58:05.082]  Having a current drill going on, having a big TV production with the government involved months before it happens and the exact same thing happening.
[00:58:06.101 --> 00:58:09.604]  And you'll find this in every case, by the way.
[00:58:09.884 --> 00:58:10.785]  It's not isolated.
[00:58:12.046 --> 00:58:18.511]  In every case, they'll have the real drill at the time and they'll have a TV show, the exact same thing happening, airing within two months before.
[00:58:19.132 --> 00:58:20.033]  It's just the rule.
[00:58:20.293 --> 00:58:21.114]  It's how they do it.
[00:58:21.954 --> 00:58:22.775]  It's a formula.
[00:58:23.673 --> 00:58:30.700]  The Defense Department spends $44 million a year hiring script writers just to write scripts of possible terror attacks.
[00:58:30.740 --> 00:58:32.281]  They, quote, say to get different ideas.
[00:58:32.661 --> 00:58:37.146]  No, those are being used then as a war game plan for actual attacks they'll carry out against us.
[00:58:37.546 --> 00:58:40.308]  We'll be right back with your calls in the news.
[00:58:41.650 --> 00:58:45.914]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.613 --> 00:58:58.253]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.914 --> 00:58:59.975]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.695 --> 00:59:01.796]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.457 --> 00:59:03.278]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.018 --> 00:59:04.999]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:09.243]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.784 --> 00:59:13.887]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.213 --> 00:59:29.436]  Hugh, the disaster in the Gulf of the last month has been a lesson to us.
[00:59:31.557 --> 00:59:36.639]  It's that the federal government is going to use any disaster as a way to take more liberties and freedoms.
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:42.142]  They're getting rid of Posse Comitatus to turn America into an open martial law dictatorship.
[00:59:42.202 --> 00:59:48.345]  It's openly being called for as they've been making preparations to get rid of it for years, quietly setting up their forces.
[00:59:49.946 --> 00:59:53.068]  Now we're looking at a Category 5 hurricane probably slowing to a 4.
[00:59:54.361 --> 00:59:56.122]  And then a three as it makes landfall.
[00:59:56.202 --> 00:59:58.263]  Still, absolute devastation.
[01:00:00.025 --> 01:00:13.193]  If it goes into the Houston Ship Channel and hits Galveston and the Houston Ship Channel, it could just make the disaster in the Gulf pale in significance when we're talking about the loss of oil refining capacity.
[01:00:14.474 --> 01:00:18.116]  The Texas coast refining around 30% of the nation's crude oil.
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:24.961]  Around 20% just in the Houston area, Texas City, Houston area.
[01:00:26.902 --> 01:00:28.642]  Very, very serious.
[01:00:29.422 --> 01:00:30.983]  We're going to be covering it right now.
[01:00:31.043 --> 01:00:32.263]  Let's go back to your calls.
[01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:35.884]  Let's talk to Joey in Florida.
[01:00:35.944 --> 01:00:36.805]  Joey, go ahead.
[01:00:37.325 --> 01:00:38.325]  Hey, Alex, how you doing?
[01:00:38.425 --> 01:00:42.426]  I'd just like to touch on something you spoke about earlier, an actual U.N.
[01:00:42.486 --> 01:00:43.086]  resolution.
[01:00:43.126 --> 01:00:46.467]  I don't know if the listeners are too familiar with it, but it'd be all right.
[01:00:46.527 --> 01:00:48.408]  Would it be okay if I could just read it over the air?
[01:00:48.488 --> 01:00:49.168]  Sure, go ahead.
[01:00:49.248 --> 01:00:49.348]  Okay.
[01:00:49.858 --> 01:01:00.834]  Okay, it's actually Resolution 3172, Convention of Prohibiting Military and Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques.
[01:01:01.435 --> 01:01:02.937]  You go down to Article 1, it says,
[01:01:03.732 --> 01:01:20.679]  Each state party to this convention undertakes not to engage in military and or any other hostile use of an environmental modification technique having widespread, long-lasting, or severe effects as a means of destruction, damage, injury to any other state party.
[01:01:20.899 --> 01:01:24.500]  And I guess it kind of reiterates it through the whole thing, through the article, too.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:31.683]  And the actual thing about William Cohen, his actual, I guess verbatim, what he said
[01:01:32.484 --> 01:01:53.784]  He talks, I guess there's something written about this term and scientist laboratories are trying to divide certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so they could just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races and others are designing some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops.
[01:01:54.025 --> 01:01:55.466]  Others are engaging
[01:01:55.962 --> 01:02:08.270]  Even in an ecotype of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, set off earthquakes, volcanoes, remotely through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[01:02:08.350 --> 01:02:10.571]  It's pretty self-explanatory.
[01:02:10.591 --> 01:02:12.012]  I don't know how anyone can deny that.
[01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:18.516]  Well, I want to know how they knew when this hurricane was in the Atlantic that it was going to hit Houston.
[01:02:18.536 --> 01:02:19.717]  That's unprecedented.
[01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:21.338]  That's suspicious.
[01:02:22.011 --> 01:02:27.996]  Well, in my humble opinion, it seems to me like some kind of well-organized strategic attack.
[01:02:28.197 --> 01:02:36.484]  You know, like first you have 9-11, now you have, just like that show you were talking about, Oil Storm, and now this thing's coming right to more oil refineries.
[01:02:36.564 --> 01:02:39.987]  I mean, like you said, we could be looking at $6 a gallon oil prices.
[01:02:40.327 --> 01:02:45.592]  And there are 300-mile stretches where there's not big refineries, but it never hits there.
[01:02:45.612 --> 01:02:48.495]  It just always hits exactly on the big refineries.
[01:02:49.035 --> 01:02:53.799]  And FEMA's there jamming communications and cutting police lines and not letting food or water in.
[01:02:54.279 --> 01:02:55.840]  So I'm worried about the aftermath.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.523]  I mean, are the feds going to swoop in and start confiscating guns here?
[01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:01.724]  I have no idea.
[01:03:01.744 --> 01:03:09.049]  I'm a fireman in Tampa, and I've had a couple of these meetings with FEMA in the past, and it's pretty much something similar to what was on your tapes.
[01:03:09.410 --> 01:03:14.994]  They didn't actually get into the Christian thing, but when they come into town, they're the guys that are in charge.
[01:03:15.094 --> 01:03:18.216]  I'll tell you what, for those that don't know what's in road to tyranny, why don't you tell them?
[01:03:19.281 --> 01:03:25.064]  Pretty much that the Christians are the evildoers, and they're the ones that, I guess... Stay there.
[01:03:25.084 --> 01:03:26.005]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[01:03:26.025 --> 01:03:28.286]  I want to hear a little bit about what FEMA has to say to you, Joey.
[01:03:28.686 --> 01:03:30.147]  Firefighter in Tampa, Florida.
[01:03:30.667 --> 01:03:31.347]  Stay with us, my friend.
[01:03:31.367 --> 01:03:32.728]  We'll let you finish up on the other side briefly.
[01:03:32.748 --> 01:03:33.589]  We'll let you get out of here.
[01:03:33.609 --> 01:03:36.610]  And we'll get to Jeff and Steve and Alex and Mark and many others.
[01:03:38.071 --> 01:03:39.932]  Yeah, I didn't plug my videos last hour.
[01:03:40.012 --> 01:03:40.532]  I should have.
[01:03:40.552 --> 01:03:44.054]  Yeah, a little three-minute segment of that almost three-hour film.
[01:03:44.594 --> 01:03:46.295]  FEMA's saying all Christians are terrorists.
[01:03:46.315 --> 01:03:47.516]  The Founding Fathers are bad.
[01:03:48.454 --> 01:03:50.315]  And they're going to get your guns.
[01:03:50.575 --> 01:03:51.515]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.356 --> 01:03:57.217]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.477 --> 01:03:58.158]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.258 --> 01:03:59.038]  Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.398 --> 01:04:04.080]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:08.861]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.261 --> 01:04:13.443]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.663 --> 01:04:16.504]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.584 --> 01:04:21.247]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.447 --> 01:04:25.869]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:33.313]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.573 --> 01:04:35.994]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.154 --> 01:04:37.895]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:04:55.043 --> 01:04:56.103]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.404 --> 01:04:59.205]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.465 --> 01:05:03.626]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.047 --> 01:05:04.887]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.187 --> 01:05:09.769]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.249 --> 01:05:12.371]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.871 --> 01:05:27.583]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.623 --> 01:05:34.669]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:05:35.009 --> 01:05:39.412]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[01:05:39.852 --> 01:05:41.634]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.654 --> 01:05:41.854]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:53.160 --> 01:05:56.541]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:05:56.781 --> 01:05:57.101]  Why?
[01:05:57.121 --> 01:06:00.081]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:06:00.161 --> 01:06:05.102]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:06:05.222 --> 01:06:14.924]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.
[01:06:15.104 --> 01:06:22.565]  Right now, as a special for GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping, a 30% savings off the regular price.
[01:06:22.705 --> 01:06:23.926]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[01:06:23.946 --> 01:06:27.187]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:06:54.469 --> 01:07:00.493]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.113 --> 01:07:04.155]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.916 --> 01:07:21.925]  That's right, we are occupied by the private corporate interests that are not free market, that use government to go after their competition, to extract wealth from the average American, and then pay it to themselves through the government conduits and pipelines as corporate welfare.
[01:07:23.146 --> 01:07:28.049]  And now the private corporations are giving themselves governmental powers through the government.
[01:07:29.811 --> 01:07:35.775]  Texas says no to putting a tiny transponder in all our cars to taxes as we go down regular roads.
[01:07:37.596 --> 01:07:40.518]  TxDOT says we don't care if there's no law.
[01:07:41.759 --> 01:07:48.884]  We're going to instruct the Department of Public Safety to just start setting up checkpoints in the next two years.
[01:07:48.924 --> 01:07:52.366]  They just ordered two million of these to start and forcing you to take it.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:55.220]  I've got business wire right here in front of me.
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.801]  Just, there's no law.
[01:07:56.861 --> 01:07:58.141]  We've got men with guns.
[01:08:00.821 --> 01:08:02.982]  I mean, it's just in your face.
[01:08:03.202 --> 01:08:05.842]  There's no law saying we can take your guns in New Orleans.
[01:08:07.382 --> 01:08:11.403]  But, I guess the law does say you've got this right unless it's prescribed by law.
[01:08:12.043 --> 01:08:12.723]  I am the law.
[01:08:12.783 --> 01:08:14.184]  I am Judge Dredd.
[01:08:14.584 --> 01:08:16.164]  Judge, jury, and executioner.
[01:08:18.604 --> 01:08:22.345]  And now we've got Hurricane Rita barreling towards...
[01:08:23.979 --> 01:08:29.245]  The most populated area of Texas, Galveston and Houston, and the surrounding areas.
[01:08:30.567 --> 01:08:32.950]  It's at 170 miles per hour.
[01:08:32.970 --> 01:08:40.539]  It looks like it might even be building strength as it goes over the hottest areas of the central gulf of Mexico.
[01:08:42.549 --> 01:08:49.934]  And we were talking to Joey in Florida, a firefighter in Tampa, and he was talking about dealing with FEMA when they come up with these little teach-ins for the firefighters and police.
[01:08:49.954 --> 01:08:58.400]  And he mentioned the footage we got in Kansas City of FEMA commando teaching the firemen and police that all Christians are terrorists, enemies of the government.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:01.322]  All the founding fathers were terrorists and that were enemies.
[01:09:01.902 --> 01:09:06.085]  And he said FEMA didn't teach them exactly that, but something similar.
[01:09:07.066 --> 01:09:09.928]  Tell us, Joey, exactly how FEMA behaves.
[01:09:10.543 --> 01:09:18.455]  Well, they actually, if my memory serves correct, they actually, this was before the 9-11 attacks, but they go through this spiel.
[01:09:18.836 --> 01:09:23.643]  They did go through the George Washington thing that the actual founding fathers were terrorists, if you look at it.
[01:09:24.133 --> 01:09:28.614]  And then they actually just, as far as terrorist attacks, how they would come about.
[01:09:28.634 --> 01:09:37.037]  You know, there'd be, like when we come up on scene on a call on something like that, we'd have to have police protection with us, and there'd be a series of three blasts.
[01:09:37.157 --> 01:09:40.238]  I mean, basically telling us how it would happen before it even happened.
[01:09:40.338 --> 01:09:46.659]  You know, there'd be one explosion, then another explosion behind it, and then possibly a third device that would go off.
[01:09:46.699 --> 01:09:48.500]  And they specifically told you about what?
[01:09:50.093 --> 01:09:58.015]  Well, just about how these, like if we're in a situation like that, it was a hypothetical thing, but if you're in a situation... You know, it's weird.
[01:09:58.155 --> 01:10:05.377]  I was sent like 16 hours of FEMA in Kansas City, and I've been sent similar stuff as well.
[01:10:05.437 --> 01:10:06.737]  I could make a whole film of this stuff.
[01:10:07.638 --> 01:10:08.278]  And it's weird.
[01:10:08.318 --> 01:10:09.758]  They'll go, we need to keep you safe, man.
[01:10:10.018 --> 01:10:10.838]  God and fathers are evil.
[01:10:11.659 --> 01:10:13.839]  We need to get the Christians.
[01:10:14.699 --> 01:10:15.620]  That's how you stay safe.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.300]  I mean, it doesn't even make sense.
[01:10:17.896 --> 01:10:22.341]  I mean, I watched 16 hours of this, this firefighter shot with these police.
[01:10:22.862 --> 01:10:24.704]  And this is in Kansas.
[01:10:24.724 --> 01:10:27.247]  You're in Tampa, Kansas City, Missouri.
[01:10:27.507 --> 01:10:28.528]  You're in Tampa, Florida.
[01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:30.531]  This guy is stomping around.
[01:10:31.537 --> 01:10:35.398]  I mean, were people shaking their heads when they said that the Founding Fathers are terrorists?
[01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:37.118]  And that's the bad thing.
[01:10:37.138 --> 01:10:38.639]  That brings me to my next question.
[01:10:39.519 --> 01:10:41.880]  You know, how come you don't have a radio show here in Tampa?
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:46.501]  Because when I try to tell, actually, you know, I've got some friends on the job.
[01:10:46.521 --> 01:10:51.222]  When I try to tell them of what's going on, you're labeled right off the bat a conspiracy nut.
[01:10:51.682 --> 01:10:52.583]  No, you could actually...
[01:11:12.294 --> 01:11:17.156]  Open your shirt up to the headmation of a pentagram and go, You're going to the top.
[01:11:17.196 --> 01:11:18.116]  No, I'm serious.
[01:11:18.436 --> 01:11:22.898]  And then you'd probably shoot right to the top and get to go into the black mass and everything.
[01:11:23.578 --> 01:11:28.740]  Just go, I'll probably kneel before you.
[01:11:29.080 --> 01:11:30.261]  Go, Yes, Lord.
[01:11:30.701 --> 01:11:31.421]  Yes, Satan.
[01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:32.441]  Yes.
[01:11:32.922 --> 01:11:34.062]  I didn't know you were here, Lord.
[01:11:34.222 --> 01:11:36.283]  No, Jesus is my Lord and Savior.
[01:11:36.303 --> 01:11:36.823]  It's a joke.
[01:11:40.645 --> 01:11:46.548]  I know it is, but let me ask you though, Alex, how come y'all don't have a station here in Tampa to try to inform people?
[01:11:46.588 --> 01:11:48.689]  Sir, it is a miracle.
[01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:55.913]  It is a blessing from God that we are on in Chicago, that we are on a station between L.A.
[01:11:55.973 --> 01:11:58.615]  and San Diego covering much of both those cities.
[01:11:59.035 --> 01:12:01.436]  It's a blessing that we're on in Austin, Texas.
[01:12:01.516 --> 01:12:05.198]  It's a blessing that we're on in Pensacola, Florida right now.
[01:12:05.939 --> 01:12:12.204]  It is a blessing that we're on in places like Bentonville, Maryland.
[01:12:12.644 --> 01:12:15.947]  One of our satellites went non-digital, so we're not even on there now.
[01:12:15.967 --> 01:12:17.548]  We're trying to figure out how to get back on.
[01:12:18.009 --> 01:12:23.293]  It is a blessing that I'm on dozens and dozens of AM and FM stations.
[01:12:24.214 --> 01:12:26.776]  Most of them are owned by these big corporations.
[01:12:27.859 --> 01:12:31.140]  Who are owned by the people that are going to get more power out of all this.
[01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:42.764]  So they're going to put a fake conservative on to neutralize you, to make sure people don't learn that FEMA openly is training to take your guns and forcefully inject you and take your children.
[01:12:43.384 --> 01:12:49.646]  I mean, imagine if every cop in America knew that FEMA is training... I mean, I guess every cop in America will get the training.
[01:12:49.666 --> 01:12:51.187]  I get the reports from everywhere.
[01:12:51.207 --> 01:12:52.067]  I have video of it.
[01:12:52.467 --> 01:12:54.288]  That the founding fathers are all evil.
[01:12:54.348 --> 01:12:55.969]  That the Constitution is evil.
[01:12:56.289 --> 01:12:57.249]  That America is evil.
[01:12:58.078 --> 01:13:04.464]  I mean, I would think that cops and firemen hearing this would jump up and say, you know, arrest that man.
[01:13:04.504 --> 01:13:05.124]  That's treason.
[01:13:05.584 --> 01:13:06.986]  But, you know, they seem to think it's good.
[01:13:07.006 --> 01:13:11.369]  I mean, listen, when you were in that audience, because we've got footage of an audience, they're nodding their heads.
[01:13:11.409 --> 01:13:12.650]  Yes, Christians are the enemy.
[01:13:13.411 --> 01:13:16.774]  I'm going to ask you, I mean, what were people doing while they were saying all this?
[01:13:18.144 --> 01:13:20.506]  I can't recall whether they touched on Christians or not.
[01:13:21.047 --> 01:13:24.270]  But they did make the George Washington is a terrorist government.
[01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:26.152]  They said the George Washington thing, I remember.
[01:13:26.192 --> 01:13:29.696]  They said you can consider them, you know, the founders were terrorists.
[01:13:30.277 --> 01:13:31.658]  And I thought that was a bunch of bunk.
[01:13:31.698 --> 01:13:33.860]  But other than that, I mean, I can't remember.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:35.662]  It was a while ago.
[01:13:35.682 --> 01:13:36.423]  I haven't had a class.
[01:13:36.503 --> 01:13:38.265]  Yeah, that was the training they were doing in what, 2000?
[01:13:39.406 --> 01:13:40.487]  What a job God's from 2000.
[01:13:40.527 --> 01:13:44.228]  Yeah, they were getting us ready for the government attack.
[01:13:44.248 --> 01:13:50.731]  Well, even their training manual that year had pictures of the World Trade Centers with crosshairs on the exact spots that were hit.
[01:13:51.791 --> 01:13:52.571]  It's all part of the fun.
[01:13:52.991 --> 01:13:55.232]  You know, another thing I'd like to touch on real quick, if I could.
[01:13:55.933 --> 01:14:06.737]  These actual areas that are being hit by these man-made storms, they have something called United Nations Core Reserves, or Biospheres.
[01:14:07.256 --> 01:14:12.241]  And a lot of these places are marked where it actually says little to no human use.
[01:14:13.062 --> 01:14:17.966]  Where humans, you know, these earth lovers, it says that they won't be allowed to live in these spots, I guess.
[01:14:18.007 --> 01:14:20.349]  Well, no, no, sir, you're absolutely on target.
[01:14:20.389 --> 01:14:25.814]  And next time FEMA comes around teaching that stuff, go, oh, I want to videotape this because it's so special.
[01:14:26.455 --> 01:14:31.800]  Or have a bag and cut a hole in the bag and set it on your desk and videotape them.
[01:14:32.665 --> 01:14:35.907]  They've got some really good, small, cheap cameras now and trying to get us video.
[01:14:35.927 --> 01:14:36.768]  God bless you, Joey.
[01:14:36.788 --> 01:14:37.408]  All right, thank you, Alex.
[01:14:37.428 --> 01:14:38.128]  Have a nice day, bud.
[01:14:38.169 --> 01:14:38.529]  You bet.
[01:14:38.549 --> 01:14:39.229]  You be careful.
[01:14:39.609 --> 01:14:40.770]  We just love firefighters.
[01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:42.471]  They're such great, patriotic Americans.
[01:14:43.032 --> 01:14:44.092]  Still public servants.
[01:14:44.132 --> 01:14:47.895]  One of the last groups of public servants left are firefighters, folks.
[01:14:50.116 --> 01:14:56.340]  Once police were as honored as firefighters, of course not anymore because they've gone over to the dark side, many of them.
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:14:59.482]  But for those that just joined us, this is not a joke.
[01:15:00.569 --> 01:15:12.133]  They train people that all homeschoolers are terrorists, that the Founding Fathers are terrorists, that all Christians and the Christian religion is terrorism, and that we need to be arrested and put in camps.
[01:15:12.213 --> 01:15:14.254]  Now, they're training the police all over the country.
[01:15:14.274 --> 01:15:14.875]  This is the case.
[01:15:15.675 --> 01:15:18.256]  I know there's cops listening all over the country that sat there and heard it.
[01:15:18.916 --> 01:15:19.656]  And I don't know how.
[01:15:19.676 --> 01:15:21.257]  I mean, that's like a body snatcher movie.
[01:15:22.799 --> 01:15:33.644]  Can you imagine making a movie 20 years ago where a town's taken over by devil worshippers, and the one good cop's been out of town for three years, and he comes back to town, like one of those H.P.
[01:15:33.664 --> 01:15:46.729]  Lovecraft books, and he goes in, and he sits down, and they start going, and the Christians are terrorists, and the government is good, and the founders were bad, and those talking about the Constitution are evil terrorists.
[01:15:46.769 --> 01:15:47.529]  Don't trust them.
[01:15:47.890 --> 01:15:48.990]  We've got to get them out.
[01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:55.064]  And then he acts like he's with them and freaks out on it and tries to fight back and get help.
[01:15:55.144 --> 01:15:58.526]  And at the end, they capture him and, you know, sacrifice him.
[01:15:58.626 --> 01:16:03.910]  I mean, you know, what's that famous movie, Race with the Devil, where the sheriff's a devil worshiper and it's all like that?
[01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:06.372]  I mean, this is just right out in the open, folks.
[01:16:07.453 --> 01:16:10.355]  And most Masons aren't bad.
[01:16:10.375 --> 01:16:11.075]  They're low level.
[01:16:11.095 --> 01:16:12.176]  They're not in the higher rooms.
[01:16:12.236 --> 01:16:15.298]  But, yeah, you get up to 32nd, 33rd degrees.
[01:16:15.358 --> 01:16:18.961]  I mean, it is kneeling before Lucifer, asking Lucifer to enter you.
[01:16:20.305 --> 01:16:39.611]  Well, it's like the Tony Blair articles in big British newspapers where he gets in the pentagram and the circle and his wife's a witch and he wears this little bag around his neck and he does Aztec rituals where he flops around screaming, becoming possessed, and they just go, well, it's okay if the Prime Minister has the spirits enter him.
[01:16:41.557 --> 01:16:46.222]  Oh, see, it's not like a movie like Race for the Devil where it's a freak out and a big deal.
[01:16:46.242 --> 01:16:48.684]  It's just kind of, yeah, we're going to get you, Christians.
[01:16:50.126 --> 01:16:51.707]  And Satan's good.
[01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:55.551]  You're just backwards.
[01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:57.613]  You don't understand it.
[01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:00.916]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in Texas and Steve, Alex, and others.
[01:17:00.936 --> 01:17:01.596]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:17:01.876 --> 01:17:02.637]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[01:17:02.697 --> 01:17:10.281]  I'd like to briefly describe a principle I learned in Quantico that I think describes the tempo of the endgame that's going on here.
[01:17:11.682 --> 01:17:18.186]  In training for sustained combat operations, they taught us this cycle called the OODA cycle or the OODA loop.
[01:17:18.626 --> 01:17:23.569]  It's O-O-D-A, which is Orientation, Observation, Decision, Action.
[01:17:24.045 --> 01:17:37.943]  And the principle was, if you're carrying out sustained operations against an enemy, in order for him to attack you, he has to orient himself toward you, he has to observe what you're doing, he has to make a decision about how he's going to attack you, and then he has to take action.
[01:17:38.812 --> 01:17:42.774]  And if you, against him, can make your cycle shorter, i.e.
[01:17:42.854 --> 01:17:47.476]  faster than his, in all chance and probability... It throws him off course.
[01:17:47.656 --> 01:17:52.858]  It's just like how we defeated the Mexicans at San Jacinto.
[01:17:53.058 --> 01:17:54.478]  We attacked them when they weren't ready.
[01:17:54.799 --> 01:17:55.039]  Right.
[01:17:55.099 --> 01:18:05.323]  Now, if this Katrina and Rita cycle here is... if the government's behind it, you can fully expect there's a bigger thing coming more rapidly behind...
[01:18:05.883 --> 01:18:08.365]  Rita, and I think with your... Well, that's exactly what they're doing.
[01:18:08.385 --> 01:18:13.509]  They're pre-deploying tanks, armored vehicles, and attack helicopters at Bergstrom and other areas.
[01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:16.931]  Rick Perry was on TV saying something bigger is probably coming.
[01:18:17.131 --> 01:18:18.833]  The terrorists are probably about to strike.
[01:18:19.253 --> 01:18:21.555]  I mean, this is so... It's so obvious what they're doing.
[01:18:21.755 --> 01:18:23.776]  And I was saying that last night at dinner.
[01:18:24.477 --> 01:18:27.119]  We were all late night talking about what we think is going to happen.
[01:18:27.159 --> 01:18:28.960]  And I think... Stay there, Jeff.
[01:18:28.980 --> 01:18:30.421]  You're making just an amazing point.
[01:18:30.801 --> 01:18:33.924]  I think the probability of a terror attack is now really...
[01:18:34.424 --> 01:18:35.626]  Getting into 11th hour.
[01:18:35.686 --> 01:18:37.429]  And it's all military strategy.
[01:18:38.271 --> 01:18:39.352]  I mean, it really is.
[01:18:40.314 --> 01:18:41.937]  This is not a joke, folks.
[01:18:41.957 --> 01:18:42.798]  This is not a drill.
[01:18:43.279 --> 01:18:48.187]  Yes, you're living in a Twilight Zone episode right now, and I think it's only going to get worse.
[01:18:48.227 --> 01:18:48.668]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.565 --> 01:18:56.787]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.207 --> 01:19:01.570]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:19:01.851 --> 01:19:07.635]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:19:07.875 --> 01:19:11.938]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:19:12.218 --> 01:19:17.863]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:19:17.983 --> 01:19:20.605]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:19:22.686 --> 01:19:26.587]  By mid-1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:19:26.627 --> 01:19:29.008]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:19:29.348 --> 01:19:31.649]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:19:32.029 --> 01:19:35.650]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:19:36.130 --> 01:19:42.352]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:19:42.772 --> 01:19:43.752]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:19:44.092 --> 01:19:44.432]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:44.472 --> 01:19:44.712]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.163 --> 01:19:54.764]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:19:55.144 --> 01:20:00.868]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:20:01.128 --> 01:20:06.272]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:20:06.612 --> 01:20:15.878]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:20:16.238 --> 01:20:21.199]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:20:21.519 --> 01:20:25.540]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:30.501]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:20:30.862 --> 01:20:36.783]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:20:37.103 --> 01:20:46.147]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[01:20:59.493 --> 01:21:04.615]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, Give me liberty or give me death.
[01:21:05.626 --> 01:21:09.728]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution.
[01:21:10.168 --> 01:21:18.831]  Your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.

[01:21:38.088 --> 01:21:40.529]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[01:21:40.549 --> 01:21:41.149]  Just call right now.
[01:21:54.232 --> 01:21:54.653]  Thanks for watching!
[01:22:12.293 --> 01:22:15.137]  Is it then any wonder we have so much chronic disease in today's world?
[01:22:15.337 --> 01:22:17.400]  We all need the unmedical miracle oxygen.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.747]  This book will teach you simple, inexpensive ways to increase your body's oxygen level without negative side effects.
[01:22:22.968 --> 01:22:28.455]  This is especially important for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and health conscious persons.
[01:22:28.595 --> 01:22:28.935]  That's 888-224-7416.
[01:22:57.984 --> 01:22:59.885]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:23:00.365 --> 01:23:03.166]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.927 --> 01:23:10.350]  So, if there's flooding and serious disasters in Texas, don't look for them to bring you food and water.
[01:23:10.890 --> 01:23:13.391]  Look for men in black masks to come looking for your guns.
[01:23:14.632 --> 01:23:20.774]  And then if you won't leave your area after it floods, I guess they'll just tell you no food or water allowed into you.
[01:23:20.854 --> 01:23:22.595]  I mean, that's what the feds did in New Orleans.
[01:23:23.255 --> 01:23:26.677]  I don't know if they can get away with that again, but we're talking to...
[01:23:27.671 --> 01:23:37.939]  Jeff in Texas about military strategies, military science, military tactics, which the globalists are clearly following.
[01:23:37.979 --> 01:23:39.840]  And we know they're using these disasters.
[01:23:41.201 --> 01:23:48.667]  It's debatable whether they're generating them or scaring them, though they admit they have that technology, to bring in a police state.
[01:23:49.247 --> 01:23:52.630]  But it is scary to have Rick Perry go, and this is exactly when the terrorists will hit us,
[01:23:53.623 --> 01:24:00.890]  What does having Apache attack helicopters at Bergstrom and tanks rolling around... How does that keep you safe?
[01:24:01.531 --> 01:24:03.693]  No, that's for oppressing populations.
[01:24:04.752 --> 01:24:06.333]  So, Jeff, please continue.
[01:24:06.613 --> 01:24:08.654]  Yeah, well, just two observations here, Alex.
[01:24:08.834 --> 01:24:18.578]  One, given that they have to speed up this cycle, not only to keep us off guard, but also to keep covering up for the lies that they've told for the previous incidents.
[01:24:19.358 --> 01:24:19.918]  Oh, no, I agree.
[01:24:19.938 --> 01:24:20.818]  They leapfrogged.
[01:24:20.858 --> 01:24:27.341]  That's why, to keep us off kilter with 9-11, we see that strategy with the White House launching the anthrax attacks.
[01:24:27.661 --> 01:24:30.142]  And, folks, for those who don't know, that's absolutely public.
[01:24:30.462 --> 01:24:32.183]  Even European papers say it's conclusive.
[01:24:32.883 --> 01:24:35.304]  Bush on Cipro, on and on and on.
[01:24:35.384 --> 01:24:35.524]  U.S.
[01:24:35.584 --> 01:24:38.565]  patented, weaponized congressional study and drill.
[01:24:38.905 --> 01:24:39.586]  How to send it.
[01:24:39.886 --> 01:24:41.546]  Enemies of the globalists at Big Senate.
[01:24:42.407 --> 01:24:44.948]  Then on the heels of that, we have the sniper attacks.
[01:24:45.368 --> 01:24:46.428]  Clearly a government op.
[01:24:46.508 --> 01:24:49.510]  And that's all in Operation Northwoods, a previous plan.
[01:24:49.530 --> 01:24:49.910]  Go ahead.
[01:24:50.130 --> 01:24:57.072]  Yeah, well, you know, any good military planner, a top general, is also an incredibly good logistical planner, a logician.
[01:24:57.112 --> 01:24:58.273]  So now's the time to look.
[01:24:58.793 --> 01:25:03.437]  Well, I'm saying where the weird stuff's been going on is in Austin.
[01:25:03.877 --> 01:25:09.902]  There was a two-seat Hornet that flew over two days ago right over my house here downtown.
[01:25:09.942 --> 01:25:12.043]  Oh, you're in Austin, too?
[01:25:12.083 --> 01:25:12.264]  Yeah.
[01:25:20.738 --> 01:25:24.500]  And the other thing I wanted to say... Tell people what a two-seat Hornet is.
[01:25:24.800 --> 01:25:26.341]  Well, it's the F-18 Hornet.
[01:25:26.481 --> 01:25:29.342]  It's a two-engine fighter used by the Navy and the Marines.
[01:25:29.422 --> 01:25:30.743]  It's air and ground.
[01:25:31.303 --> 01:25:35.485]  And the two-seater is either a trainer or it's an all-weather variant.
[01:25:36.125 --> 01:25:38.126]  But it's totally deadly, you know, either way.
[01:25:38.246 --> 01:25:40.787]  Well, I mean, what are armored vehicles and tanks...
[01:25:42.788 --> 01:25:45.550]  What's that six-wheeled marine vehicle, the Warrior?
[01:25:46.090 --> 01:25:50.553]  Yeah, they have one that's specifically designed for NBC operations, too.
[01:25:50.753 --> 01:25:57.778]  Yeah, well, there's Warriors now in town, we know, and they've also got a bunch of Apaches, which are out there.
[01:25:57.798 --> 01:26:03.662]  I mean, what does that have to do with... Well, look at FEMA's top contingency exercises.
[01:26:03.702 --> 01:26:09.886]  You've got New Orleans, you have an earthquake on the West Coast, and you have a major terrorist attack in New York.
[01:26:10.327 --> 01:26:14.635]  As crazy as everything else is right now, I'd look at those scenarios as being the most
[01:26:16.201 --> 01:26:20.023]  Well, we also have to see what they've drilled for and had made-for-TV movies for.
[01:26:20.764 --> 01:26:27.907]  They've been drilling, really, for a bio-attack or a suitcase nuke, and now they're on TV saying the terrorists are probably going to hit us.
[01:26:28.268 --> 01:26:33.070]  Now, they say that all the time to get us to be fearful and lick their boots, but I agree with you.
[01:26:33.150 --> 01:26:38.073]  Right now, with this double whammy, is the time that Al-CIA may strike.
[01:26:38.313 --> 01:26:38.913]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:26:38.933 --> 01:26:39.854]  All right, thanks, Alex.
[01:26:40.334 --> 01:26:41.154]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:41.535 --> 01:26:43.156]  I think we should all turn our guns in.
[01:26:43.196 --> 01:26:43.856]  That's the answer.
[01:26:44.762 --> 01:26:46.484]  And none of you should have storable foods.
[01:26:46.544 --> 01:26:47.805]  None of you should be self-sufficient.
[01:26:48.205 --> 01:26:49.866]  Just trust your government.
[01:26:51.047 --> 01:26:53.009]  Thank a FEMA person near you.
[01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:55.291]  And we'll all be safe.
[01:26:55.311 --> 01:26:56.472]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic.
[01:26:56.832 --> 01:26:58.093]  Steve in Texas.
[01:26:58.133 --> 01:26:58.634]  Go ahead, Steve.
[01:26:59.254 --> 01:27:01.656]  Yeah, this is for those listeners in Austin.
[01:27:02.657 --> 01:27:07.081]  Kudos, by the way, on your anti-Metro protests on Saturday.
[01:27:07.679 --> 01:27:19.645]  The city of Austin, these same clowns that put on that parade are now going to propose a city council resolution, I'm sure put in by Raul Alvarez, against the Minutemen and four illegal aliens.
[01:27:19.885 --> 01:27:24.908]  Did you see where the ACLU lawyer called the Minutemen terrorists and said they're going to blow stuff up?
[01:27:25.108 --> 01:27:26.209]  That's total slander.
[01:27:26.549 --> 01:27:32.792]  As a matter of fact, I was at their meeting at the UT Law School where he repeated that last night, Ray Ubarra.
[01:27:33.447 --> 01:27:40.595]  On the American Civil Liberties Union, he professed himself as a Chicano first before he even started the meeting.
[01:27:40.635 --> 01:27:46.621]  He says that the Minutemen, the kind of hatred and racism... I wish you'd have got some video of that, Steve.
[01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:47.442]  This is Steve Mason.
[01:27:48.743 --> 01:27:52.326]  Well, Steve, when is this disgusting resolution coming up?
[01:27:52.827 --> 01:27:53.207]  Tonight.
[01:27:53.647 --> 01:28:01.094]  You know, I need people to call the Minutemen out in Arizona, because I keep trying to get, what's the head of the Texas Minutemen from that chapter?
[01:28:01.374 --> 01:28:02.815]  Al Garza?
[01:28:02.935 --> 01:28:13.425]  Yeah, I keep trying to get Al Garza on, who these horrible comments were made about by the ACLU guy, and I call them over and over again, and it's just, they will not call me back.
[01:28:13.865 --> 01:28:14.826]  I cannot get them on.
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.041]  And it's very irritating.
[01:28:17.301 --> 01:28:18.462]  You need to call Sandra Bean.
[01:28:18.482 --> 01:28:19.843]  I already talked to Sandra Bean.
[01:28:19.883 --> 01:28:21.504]  That's another group of Texas Minute Men.
[01:28:21.784 --> 01:28:22.264]  Oh, I see.
[01:28:22.524 --> 01:28:23.425]  Yes, yes.
[01:28:23.505 --> 01:28:29.268]  I've talked to a lot of people to call out there to the Minute Men in Tombstone and say, get on the horn.
[01:28:29.368 --> 01:28:35.292]  Alex is here defending you, having rallies to defend you, and he can't even get a call back from you guys.
[01:28:36.373 --> 01:28:36.673]  You know?
[01:28:37.133 --> 01:28:40.495]  Well, I think I'll... You gotta... Excuse me?
[01:28:41.476 --> 01:28:41.936]  Just stay there.
[01:28:43.683 --> 01:28:44.623]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.064 --> 01:28:46.684]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.604 --> 01:28:50.385]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.507 --> 01:29:02.369]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:29:02.629 --> 01:29:04.990]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:29:05.250 --> 01:29:07.190]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:12.892]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:29:13.292 --> 01:29:17.554]  The keychain-attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:29:18.014 --> 01:29:25.916]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:29:26.097 --> 01:29:31.138]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[01:29:31.158 --> 01:29:33.179]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:29:33.679 --> 01:29:36.842]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[01:29:37.062 --> 01:29:39.544]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[01:29:39.744 --> 01:29:41.545]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[01:29:41.585 --> 01:29:46.108]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[01:29:46.349 --> 01:29:48.690]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[01:29:48.790 --> 01:29:49.291]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[01:29:53.405 --> 01:30:01.671]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.932 --> 01:30:06.275]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.575 --> 01:30:15.502]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.702 --> 01:30:19.305]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.605 --> 01:30:24.633]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.933 --> 01:30:31.623]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.139 --> 01:30:32.800]  What about you?
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:38.805]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:53.852 --> 01:30:56.995]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[01:30:57.255 --> 01:31:04.041]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[01:31:04.501 --> 01:31:17.852]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:21.916]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[01:31:22.276 --> 01:31:22.696]  Thank you.
[01:31:22.736 --> 01:31:23.096]  Thank you.
[01:31:53.539 --> 01:32:06.447]  All right, folks.
[01:32:06.467 --> 01:32:08.689]  We're back live here.
[01:32:08.829 --> 01:32:11.230]  We've got Jack McClam scheduled for the next hour.
[01:32:11.631 --> 01:32:15.994]  Police and military against the New World Order to talk about all these big police state developments.
[01:32:16.014 --> 01:32:20.997]  We're talking to Steve Mason, a friend of mine, here in Austin, Texas, expert on the La Rica Conquista's
[01:32:21.657 --> 01:32:30.746]  And yeah, this ACLU lawyer calls the Minutemen all these horrible names, says they're evil terrorists, they're going to blow people up.
[01:32:30.806 --> 01:32:33.569]  I mean, no history of violence, no nothing.
[01:32:33.609 --> 01:32:35.591]  I mean, I don't know how they get away with this.
[01:32:36.012 --> 01:32:40.196]  They must think they've got really deep pockets, and this is what makes the ACLU so despicable.
[01:32:40.822 --> 01:32:44.363]  They'll be on the right side of things against the Patriot Act, but for all the wrong reasons.
[01:32:45.103 --> 01:32:47.644]  Or they'll be against library books, you know, and the FBI.
[01:32:47.664 --> 01:32:51.525]  But then they do so many other stupid things that it makes the ACLU look bad.
[01:32:52.646 --> 01:33:03.909]  And it's just unbelievable to see this out of the ACLU, this particular loose cannon, saying this about folks.
[01:33:04.169 --> 01:33:08.751]  And then I want to get the individual who's been saying this about the Minutemen on...
[01:33:09.477 --> 01:33:12.240]  And I call there, and it's just like, Alex, who?
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:15.883]  You want to talk to the Imperial Super Lords?
[01:33:16.023 --> 01:33:17.985]  I mean, you realize how powerful we are?
[01:33:18.005 --> 01:33:20.106]  I mean, literally, it's almost like that.
[01:33:20.126 --> 01:33:24.590]  I'm not trying to sound mean or anything, but I want Chris Simcox on this show.
[01:33:24.610 --> 01:33:26.192]  I want Mr. Gomez on this show.
[01:33:26.912 --> 01:33:32.197]  And I want them on to respond to what Mr. Ubarra has been saying about them.
[01:33:33.118 --> 01:33:35.260]  And I want to support what they're coming to do here in Texas.
[01:33:36.741 --> 01:33:38.422]  Steve, go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[01:33:38.602 --> 01:33:40.984]  Indeed, we may have a hard time with it.
[01:33:42.785 --> 01:33:43.746]  Daily Texan covered it.
[01:33:43.806 --> 01:33:49.029]  You may get his remarks in the press about Minutemen wanting to blow stuff up.
[01:33:49.049 --> 01:33:59.877]  But the Bromberays, people go to AmericanPatrol.com, have renewed their threat to molest the Minutemen down in the valley coming up this October.
[01:34:01.101 --> 01:34:06.962]  For those who don't know, the Brown Berets are an openly communist, anti-American group that want to overthrow the U.S.
[01:34:08.002 --> 01:34:08.282]  Yes.
[01:34:08.862 --> 01:34:12.243]  And they openly promote the Plan of San Diego last night on TV.
[01:34:12.263 --> 01:34:15.123]  Tell them about the big UT-Hedda Chicano studies.
[01:34:15.143 --> 01:34:18.364]  We played a clip of him saying we need to implement the Plan of San Diego.
[01:34:19.444 --> 01:34:21.345]  Yep, that's Jose Andres Gutierrez.
[01:34:21.405 --> 01:34:25.065]  He was the father of that student group, Mecha, you were getting down on.
[01:34:25.125 --> 01:34:29.766]  Imagine if a white professor said, we need to kill all Hispanic males.
[01:34:30.492 --> 01:34:31.993]  Can you imagine the outcry?
[01:34:32.093 --> 01:34:32.994]  A head professor?
[01:34:33.955 --> 01:34:36.897]  Oh, he wouldn't last five minutes going out of his own office.
[01:34:37.218 --> 01:34:39.239]  But the Brown Berets have renewed their threat.
[01:34:39.259 --> 01:34:44.464]  I want to tell you something that Will Harrell, head of the local ACLU, said to me on an aside.
[01:34:45.725 --> 01:34:54.452]  This Ubarra guy talking about, while he was speaking, was talking about how violent the Minutemen are going to be and how they're going to provoke violence and start blowing up stuff like Timothy McVeigh.
[01:34:56.013 --> 01:34:58.596]  I asked him a question about, well, why aren't you...
[01:34:59.488 --> 01:35:05.133]  Are you aware of the fact that the Minutemen got attacked again in California where they got their table kicked over and everything like that?
[01:35:05.153 --> 01:35:15.862]  I mean, you mentioned the fact that the Minutemen had that rally, and yet you didn't even mention the fact that your goons, or the goons that you affiliate with, attacked them again, and you don't seem to be condemning that.
[01:35:16.983 --> 01:35:18.645]  And he ducked that question.
[01:35:19.345 --> 01:35:21.107]  Wait, so you actually talked to the guy?
[01:35:21.647 --> 01:35:23.629]  Yeah, I actually asked him a question from the audience.
[01:35:23.909 --> 01:35:26.632]  By the way, for those that don't know, I've seen the video clips.
[01:35:27.841 --> 01:35:41.892]  From Arizona, from New Mexico, from California, the Brown Berets and people actually go into hotels while people are having their continental breakfasts and start turning stuff over, kicking people, coming at them with sticks.
[01:35:42.773 --> 01:35:46.416]  And then the news reports, oh, evil Minutemen causing problems again.
[01:35:47.337 --> 01:35:55.463]  So then I asked Will Harrell, turned to the side, and I said, look, you're sending ACLU training observers to come down and observe the Minutemen and
[01:35:56.381 --> 01:36:06.668]  And put them under the spotlight, and they've never committed violence, and yet why don't you talk to the people that are actually coming right out and attacking us that you were directly affiliated with?
[01:36:07.329 --> 01:36:08.109]  You know what he said?
[01:36:08.189 --> 01:36:08.890]  He got angry.
[01:36:09.810 --> 01:36:10.551]  A bit angry.
[01:36:11.291 --> 01:36:12.732]  This is just a small aside.
[01:36:12.812 --> 01:36:22.599]  He said that it was the minute men ought to consider the fact that it's the ACLU observers down there with their cameras that are keeping them alive.
[01:36:26.038 --> 01:36:27.359]  Well, how gracious of him.
[01:36:27.379 --> 01:36:29.441]  I mean, it's like he knows.
[01:36:29.901 --> 01:36:32.443]  He knows that the men and women are being subject to deadly attacks.
[01:36:33.103 --> 01:36:36.185]  Well, Steve, I appreciate your call, and take care of my friend.
[01:36:37.466 --> 01:36:40.028]  Look, I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to say about all this.
[01:36:41.710 --> 01:36:51.617]  I got video from all over the country where they beat people on the head with two-by-fours, blood splattering, old women bleeding all over the ground, and the news will point a camera right at it and go, oh, look at the fight.
[01:36:52.822 --> 01:36:56.505]  It'll show a bunch of young communists beating up old blacks, whites, and Hispanics.
[01:36:57.285 --> 01:37:12.855]  I got video of it, while holding giant banners of white people's heads cut off, and pictures of Aztecs cutting whites' hearts out, and they'll just charge across the street, start beating them with two-by-fours, the police just stand there, do absolutely nothing, and this is the new freedom.
[01:37:12.895 --> 01:37:13.836]  I mean, I got it on video.
[01:37:14.656 --> 01:37:16.918]  And so because these groups are recruiting in Austin,
[01:37:17.478 --> 01:37:17.998]  We're good to go.
[01:37:18.078 --> 01:37:18.338]  I think?
[01:37:39.528 --> 01:37:43.791]  And I'm not one of these people that, I mean, every time I punch you, I'm going to devastate you.
[01:37:43.811 --> 01:37:44.871]  I'm going to break your jaw.
[01:37:45.151 --> 01:37:47.153]  I'm going to ram your nose off your face.
[01:37:47.433 --> 01:37:49.434]  I'm going to ram your eyes out with my fist.
[01:37:49.974 --> 01:37:51.735]  That's what's happened every time I've gotten in a fight.
[01:37:52.536 --> 01:37:57.439]  And, you know, it's like when those four guys got around me that time and told me to shut up about the New World Order.
[01:37:58.179 --> 01:38:00.080]  And one of them just hauled off and broke my nose.
[01:38:00.100 --> 01:38:03.202]  And after he did that on the security camera, I could have my way with him.
[01:38:04.045 --> 01:38:14.591]  You go ahead and pop me upside the head with a 2x4, because I've been hit upside the head with post hole diggers, a lead pipe, 2x4s, and my lights have never gone out, folks.
[01:38:14.611 --> 01:38:16.632]  I've got a skull made out of iron.
[01:38:17.213 --> 01:38:21.695]  And after you get your pop in on me when I go down to the border, you're going to be in deep trouble.
[01:38:22.536 --> 01:38:23.296]  Deep trouble.
[01:38:24.357 --> 01:38:25.437]  So just be aware of that.
[01:38:25.597 --> 01:38:28.019]  Alright, I'm shooting my mouth off.
[01:38:28.059 --> 01:38:29.900]  I just think about those women...
[01:38:30.959 --> 01:38:34.361]  Being beaten in the head with two by fours and the police just standing there.
[01:38:35.421 --> 01:38:40.664]  I remember one time a guy had a brick.
[01:38:41.344 --> 01:38:42.725]  I used to get in a lot of fights growing up in Dallas.
[01:38:42.745 --> 01:38:43.365]  It was pretty rough.
[01:38:43.805 --> 01:38:46.686]  He smashed his brick so hard in the back of my head the brick broke.
[01:38:47.847 --> 01:38:53.590]  It actually cracked and the guy was just looking at me and I didn't even... I don't know what's wrong with my head or what's going on with it.
[01:38:53.610 --> 01:38:57.011]  I've had... Anyways, I need to shut up.
[01:38:57.471 --> 01:38:58.532]  Sounds insane.
[01:38:59.788 --> 01:39:01.930]  Just shooting my mouth off in a macho fashion.
[01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:05.872]  I just... But, again, I have that attitude, so nobody hit me.
[01:39:08.514 --> 01:39:12.837]  One of the Mecha people did come over, one of the Aslan crowd, for just no reason.
[01:39:12.877 --> 01:39:17.200]  Mike Hansen standing behind state police, videotaping, saying nothing.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:18.801]  Mike just keeps his mouth shut.
[01:39:20.161 --> 01:39:21.242]  We heard it on TV last night.
[01:39:21.262 --> 01:39:22.283]  It's going up on the website today.
[01:39:23.112 --> 01:39:29.814]  And the guy just comes over, one of the Brown Beret types, and just first shoves the camera and then comes over with his cane and hits Mike with it.
[01:39:30.295 --> 01:39:31.435]  And the police did nothing.
[01:39:35.196 --> 01:39:36.957]  And I don't know.
[01:39:37.017 --> 01:39:41.698]  I mean, even if it was on camera, I'd probably, maybe I should let them beat me in the head with a two-by-four.
[01:39:42.199 --> 01:39:46.680]  I bet if you let them hit you in the head with a tire iron and then did something, you'd get in trouble.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:50.061]  See, because you've got the government on your side.
[01:39:50.361 --> 01:39:51.962]  Stop acting like you're revolutionaries.
[01:39:52.699 --> 01:39:55.981]  You've got the government on your side.
[01:40:00.003 --> 01:40:02.184]  But no, if somebody ever hits me, I will defend myself.
[01:40:02.984 --> 01:40:05.226]  I've seen plenty of video of people letting them smack you.
[01:40:05.966 --> 01:40:07.067]  And I'm not going to put up with that.
[01:40:07.507 --> 01:40:08.827]  I'll explode on somebody.
[01:40:09.388 --> 01:40:10.869]  You punch me, you're going to pay.
[01:40:11.569 --> 01:40:12.229]  Guaranteed.
[01:40:14.611 --> 01:40:18.513]  I just... It just makes me sick.
[01:40:19.573 --> 01:40:21.174]  I mean, it really does make me sick.
[01:40:22.105 --> 01:40:23.586]  That this is happening in this country.
[01:40:25.006 --> 01:40:31.969]  And let's go ahead and for a few minutes here, then we'll go to Alex and Mark and Kenny and Will.
[01:40:32.770 --> 01:40:36.111]  But Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts up in Dallas.
[01:40:37.352 --> 01:40:42.874]  Debbie, if millions of people are evacuating the Gulf Coast, where are they all going to stay, Debbie?
[01:40:42.974 --> 01:40:44.595]  They're staying at my house.
[01:40:46.396 --> 01:40:47.096]  I'm sorry.
[01:40:47.376 --> 01:40:47.696]  Oh, really?
[01:40:47.716 --> 01:40:48.557]  You've got family?
[01:40:48.717 --> 01:40:51.438]  My family's on their way here, and my distant family.
[01:40:51.883 --> 01:41:04.468]  And I have two Berkeys set up, and I have seven barrels of water in my backyard, and lots of trash bags for going potty in, and lots of canned goods, because I don't know if we'll have to leave Dallas eventually.
[01:41:04.508 --> 01:41:10.490]  You know, my power goes out every time the wind blows more than, you know, a poof.
[01:41:10.830 --> 01:41:13.511]  Well, I don't think Dallas is going to have any problems.
[01:41:13.651 --> 01:41:14.191]  I don't either.
[01:41:14.271 --> 01:41:18.193]  I'm just concerned about the rain and stuff, the after stuff, because my house really...
[01:41:18.726 --> 01:41:22.515]  Well, you guys know last Monday, two Mondays ago, the phones were out here.
[01:41:23.036 --> 01:41:25.582]  Well, for those of you who don't know, I office out of my house.
[01:41:26.324 --> 01:41:28.950]  And then the rest of our company is based out of state.
[01:41:29.488 --> 01:41:34.991]  But, you know, when the weather's bad and different things, it just kind of, you know, my electricity, my telephone goes out.
[01:41:35.311 --> 01:41:41.714]  And we do have a contingency plan for the other offices to be able to pick up the phone lines.
[01:41:41.734 --> 01:41:48.137]  Well, what's really facing devastation is Houston and Galveston.
[01:41:48.837 --> 01:41:52.599]  Tell folks about the, are you still offering the special?
[01:41:52.919 --> 01:41:58.722]  Well, what we're offering, yes, is we're offering second day air, but not into Houston because it's stupid to try and do that.
[01:41:59.162 --> 01:42:03.285]  Unless you're north of Houston like Conroe or Livingston or something like that.
[01:42:03.745 --> 01:42:12.651]  Because my daughter left Houston, she left Spring at 2.30 in the morning and she is not to Centerville yet.
[01:42:13.552 --> 01:42:15.433]  Which I believe is right at about 120 miles.
[01:42:17.498 --> 01:42:22.763]  So if we tried to second day air stuff into there, it's not going to get to the people if there's air.
[01:42:22.843 --> 01:42:30.470]  Okay, for those that don't know, I-45 and all the other major roads are literally bumper to bumper, two mile an hour traffic.
[01:42:30.530 --> 01:42:36.856]  Your daughter tried to leave Spring, a suburb of Houston.
[01:42:36.876 --> 01:42:38.317]  A northern suburb.
[01:42:38.758 --> 01:42:39.979]  A northern suburb.
[01:42:40.179 --> 01:42:41.340]  A northern suburb.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.523]  So this is all an example of what happens when disasters happen, folks.
[01:42:44.543 --> 01:42:45.344]  You can't get out.
[01:42:45.444 --> 01:42:45.745]  Right.
[01:42:45.825 --> 01:42:47.566]  And they finally got off the road.
[01:42:47.807 --> 01:42:55.174]  She tried to get gas, went to three different gas stations, finally got on a country road and got gas.
[01:42:55.595 --> 01:42:57.377]  That's what I advised in the first hour.
[01:42:58.278 --> 01:43:00.019]  Never take the main roads, folks.
[01:43:00.180 --> 01:43:00.400]  Yeah.
[01:43:01.047 --> 01:43:01.167]  Yeah.
[01:43:01.187 --> 01:43:02.909]  Because we're very sheep-like nowadays.
[01:43:02.969 --> 01:43:04.190]  Everybody takes the main road.
[01:43:04.250 --> 01:43:04.511]  Right.
[01:43:04.531 --> 01:43:07.153]  May got off the main road, and now they're doing much better.
[01:43:07.554 --> 01:43:12.278]  She called me about a half hour ago wanting me to pull out a map and tell her where she was.
[01:43:12.298 --> 01:43:18.825]  Okay, so your daughter left at 2.30 in the morning, and how many hours did she spend on I-45?
[01:43:19.505 --> 01:43:21.227]  They got off... Well, they were on I-45 until...
[01:43:24.725 --> 01:43:28.950]  About 10 o'clock this morning, and they had just got to Huntsville.
[01:43:29.210 --> 01:43:36.039]  Okay, so in seven and a half hours... Just to go from Spring to Huntsville, which is only, that's like 30 minutes.
[01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:38.642]  That's just, that's 30 miles.
[01:43:38.902 --> 01:43:42.787]  You know, you go through Conroe, you go Spring, Woodlands, Conroe, Huntsville.
[01:43:42.807 --> 01:43:44.689]  No, we've got a ranch right by Huntsville.
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:46.221]  I'll have to come.
[01:43:46.641 --> 01:43:48.162]  I'll never get to go myself.
[01:43:48.202 --> 01:43:51.084]  People need to get the filters not only to help.
[01:43:51.104 --> 01:43:54.826]  People are evacuating, so now if they have their Berkeys, they're taking them with them.
[01:43:55.246 --> 01:44:01.510]  But your family's coming to your house now, or evacuees will be coming to people's houses.
[01:44:01.570 --> 01:44:06.013]  You'll be helping people, and you still need to have your Berkeys, and you need to have them set up.
[01:44:06.313 --> 01:44:08.975]  And not only that, we're going to get hit with the bad weather.
[01:44:09.929 --> 01:44:14.873]  Now, if y'all remember Hurricane Alicia, we had the spawn tornadoes afterwards.
[01:44:15.674 --> 01:44:18.316]  You know, all kinds of things happen with hurricanes.
[01:44:18.356 --> 01:44:19.757]  Well, there's no doubt with it.
[01:44:19.917 --> 01:44:22.359]  There's no doubt, Debbie, with it 130 degrees.
[01:44:22.379 --> 01:44:22.919]  Excuse me.
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:28.924]  There's no doubt that with it 103 degrees and the hurricane at 170 miles an hour, probably hitting at 100 miles an hour,
[01:44:33.227 --> 01:44:35.188]  It's going to spawn tornadoes all over the state.
[01:44:35.228 --> 01:44:37.870]  It always does on small hurricane hits.
[01:44:38.470 --> 01:44:45.114]  But regardless, my reason to have the water filter is for emergencies, but mainly just because of the poison that's in the normal tap water.
[01:44:45.454 --> 01:44:53.579]  So folks need to give New Millennium Concept a call, whether you live in Canada or whether you live in New York City or whether you live in Ohio.
[01:44:54.637 --> 01:44:58.521]  It's time to stop procrastinating because emergencies can and do happen.
[01:44:58.901 --> 01:45:02.765]  Give Debbie a call at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:45:04.266 --> 01:45:08.210]  And folks, when you tell them Alex Jones sent you, you get the biggest discount.
[01:45:08.874 --> 01:45:10.154]  There's a lot of other resellers.
[01:45:10.194 --> 01:45:15.836]  This is the national maker of the Big Berkey, and then the national distributor of the British Berkey.
[01:45:16.196 --> 01:45:25.979]  So when you buy it from other people and other networks and other folks, when you don't hear this phone number, that means that you're getting their markup, despite whatever propaganda they spew.
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:31.061]  You get the best deals by telling them Alex Jones sent you and going to New Millennium.
[01:45:31.381 --> 01:45:32.081]  Here's the number, 1-888-
[01:45:34.482 --> 01:45:34.883]  803-4438.
[01:45:36.324 --> 01:45:39.105]  And then some of that support goes for our shortwave, what we do here.
[01:45:39.506 --> 01:45:40.406]  It's always needed.
[01:45:40.426 --> 01:45:43.888]  So it's made in America, an American company, and it supports this broadcast.
[01:45:43.908 --> 01:45:46.010]  888-803-4438.
[01:45:46.150 --> 01:45:50.392]  Or a really good way to do it is BerkeyWater.com.
[01:45:50.733 --> 01:45:51.813]  BerkeyWater.com.
[01:45:51.833 --> 01:45:52.854]  And in the comments section...
[01:45:53.394 --> 01:45:58.598]  Tell them what free gift you want, one of the water filter sports bottles or a sheltering in place DVD.
[01:45:59.298 --> 01:46:02.721]  Tell them, and then it's an Alex Jones special to get that free gift.
[01:46:03.281 --> 01:46:06.503]  And are you doing two-day shipping anywhere in the country?
[01:46:06.523 --> 01:46:13.048]  Well, we are doing two-day shipping, you know, to surrounding areas, of course.
[01:46:13.728 --> 01:46:15.850]  If people will need it in two days, we're doing it.
[01:46:15.930 --> 01:46:17.371]  Okay, so to understand, folks...
[01:46:17.884 --> 01:46:26.190]  To understand that it's like $50 on average to ship today instead of, you know, $18 ground UPS.
[01:46:26.490 --> 01:46:33.095]  So that's $40 discount, basically, or $30 discount on top of the already discounts you're going to get.
[01:46:33.195 --> 01:46:34.496]  Debbie, thank you so much.
[01:46:34.516 --> 01:46:36.237]  Alex, can I say one more thing just really quick?
[01:46:36.678 --> 01:46:46.945]  If we could please get the people to leave good day and night numbers and how late we can call because we are calling after hours because the lines are totally jammed up.
[01:46:48.027 --> 01:46:52.388]  And so what time zone are they in, leave day and night numbers, and how late we can call?
[01:46:52.448 --> 01:46:53.528]  We'll do that, Debbie, thanks.
[01:46:53.648 --> 01:46:54.348]  Okay, thanks.
[01:46:55.048 --> 01:46:57.149]  And the best way is to go to BerkeyWater.com.
[01:46:57.169 --> 01:47:03.670]  We have a link on InfoWars.com right now, to BerkeyWater.com, and take advantage of that.
[01:47:03.910 --> 01:47:06.591]  And again, an Indian knockoff is $300.
[01:47:07.571 --> 01:47:10.952]  You get a big stainless steel, black elements, best there is.
[01:47:11.672 --> 01:47:14.232]  I just bought another one of these two days ago for a friend for $225.
[01:47:17.702 --> 01:47:20.006]  And then they got the bigger ones that do three gallons for $260.
[01:47:20.907 --> 01:47:22.990]  Those things are $350 at a store.
[01:47:23.911 --> 01:47:29.039]  And there's other people, other networks out there selling them who buy them from New Millennium and then mark them up 30-50%.
[01:47:31.423 --> 01:47:32.924]  And that doesn't happen here.
[01:47:33.245 --> 01:47:34.646]  All right, side issue.
[01:47:34.706 --> 01:47:36.607]  Just Debbie wanted to come on, and I'm glad she did.
[01:47:36.948 --> 01:47:38.249]  We've got Jack McClam coming up.
[01:47:38.289 --> 01:47:41.511]  I want to cycle through your calls before we get Jack McClam on.
[01:47:42.512 --> 01:47:43.813]  Let's go to Alex in Mass.
[01:47:43.833 --> 01:47:44.754]  Alex, thanks for holding.
[01:47:44.794 --> 01:47:45.174]  Go ahead.
[01:47:45.194 --> 01:47:46.055]  That's cool.
[01:47:46.255 --> 01:47:50.258]  Yes, I was wondering, like I felt like an idiot when I gave money to the Red Cross after 9-11.
[01:47:50.378 --> 01:48:00.366]  You had someone on who had like a fund that was going directly to victims, and I was hoping that you'd be able to have some sort of display of that
[01:48:01.325 --> 01:48:08.727]  So that people actually could give money to alternatives, because I see people like Jon Stewart doing advertisements for the Red Cross, and it just makes me feel terrible.
[01:48:08.887 --> 01:48:09.447]  You know what I mean?
[01:48:10.687 --> 01:48:11.687]  No, I fully understand.
[01:48:11.747 --> 01:48:13.487]  Here's the problem, Alex.
[01:48:13.507 --> 01:48:15.368]  I have a small operation.
[01:48:15.768 --> 01:48:16.288]  I don't know.
[01:48:16.328 --> 01:48:18.308]  I thought you had, like, a lot of listeners.
[01:48:18.368 --> 01:48:19.049]  I don't know.
[01:48:19.069 --> 01:48:20.769]  You guys have a lot of hits on your website, right?
[01:48:21.029 --> 01:48:23.890]  But, sir, I have to then check out.
[01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:30.511]  Just because a listener recommends a charity doesn't mean that I can then trust that charity.
[01:48:30.899 --> 01:48:36.803]  I know, but are there any certified, real, legit, genuine people that you would trust?
[01:48:36.983 --> 01:48:39.624]  Are there any organizations, really, at all?
[01:48:39.644 --> 01:48:41.085]  Do you have any idea?
[01:48:41.105 --> 01:48:52.452]  Well, what I did was, I linked to the Austin Food Bank, because I know the people there, and I gave them, I don't know, what, $1,000?
[01:48:52.532 --> 01:48:56.515]  We gave them just several shopping carts full of food.
[01:48:57.310 --> 01:49:04.275]  Within the Wednesday, within a couple days of Hurricane Katrina, we had done that.
[01:49:04.395 --> 01:49:09.998]  Because we know they took trucks directly to Louisiana.
[01:49:10.519 --> 01:49:12.840]  And of course, FEMA stole the food and wouldn't let it get to the people.
[01:49:13.681 --> 01:49:21.546]  Now the food is piled to literally warehouse rafters, and really no more food or clothes are needed for Katrina.
[01:49:22.128 --> 01:49:26.791]  The problem is, yes, food and water will be needed, probably, for Rita.
[01:49:27.472 --> 01:49:29.733]  The problem is, FEMA won't let it get into the people.
[01:49:29.874 --> 01:49:32.335]  They're probably going to try to make things as bad as they can.
[01:49:32.355 --> 01:49:33.416]  Is there any way around that?
[01:49:35.798 --> 01:49:36.018]  No.
[01:49:36.158 --> 01:49:41.301]  FEMA are terrorists, and they will try to... So there's nobody fighting a real good fight at all?
[01:49:41.602 --> 01:49:41.722]  No.
[01:49:42.449 --> 01:49:43.889]  Well, there are a lot of people fighting.
[01:49:43.909 --> 01:49:48.491]  I just mentioned a real... I give money every year to Meals on Wheels.
[01:49:48.531 --> 01:49:50.391]  I mean, that's a real charity.
[01:49:50.451 --> 01:49:51.692]  Salvation Army's not perfect.
[01:49:51.712 --> 01:49:52.452]  They're pretty good, though.
[01:49:53.472 --> 01:49:55.013]  Hey, folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.173 --> 01:49:58.254]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.394 --> 01:50:02.295]  One look in the mirror, and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.355 --> 01:50:06.576]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:06.936 --> 01:50:09.837]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment...
[01:50:10.357 --> 01:50:10.697]  Ended.
[01:50:10.777 --> 01:50:12.658]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.818 --> 01:50:16.140]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.180 --> 01:50:20.882]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.042 --> 01:50:24.083]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.264 --> 01:50:27.145]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.625 --> 01:50:33.728]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.268 --> 01:50:34.789]  We're good to go.
[01:50:53.576 --> 01:50:56.560]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:56.921 --> 01:51:05.752]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.093 --> 01:51:10.759]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.219 --> 01:51:17.923]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.343 --> 01:51:30.110]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.590 --> 01:51:35.053]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:35.213 --> 01:51:37.535]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:37.555 --> 01:51:39.516]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:51:39.536 --> 01:51:40.757]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:40.817 --> 01:51:42.277]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:42.297 --> 01:51:43.358]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:54.133 --> 01:52:00.082]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:00.302 --> 01:52:02.565]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:02.766 --> 01:52:09.115]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:09.435 --> 01:52:10.095]  We're good to go.
[01:52:29.847 --> 01:52:30.307]  We're good to go.
[01:52:57.318 --> 01:52:59.658]  We're going to go to Mark and Kenny and Skip.
[01:53:00.539 --> 01:53:08.640]  Jack McClan is coming up to talk about FEMA and how they're probably going to try to make this the biggest disaster they can to even take over more of our society.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:10.140]  Out of calamity, they get controlled.
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:16.581]  I want to talk about the new revelations of SAS carrying out terror attacks in Iraq, dressed up as Arabs, caught red-handed.
[01:53:16.621 --> 01:53:17.742]  There is no debating it now.
[01:53:17.762 --> 01:53:24.743]  I mean, there was no debating it a month ago, but I mean, this is just evidence on top of evidence on top of red-handed...
[01:53:25.530 --> 01:53:26.912]  Evidence caught in the act.
[01:53:26.952 --> 01:53:29.856]  I mean, it doesn't get any more conclusive.
[01:53:30.997 --> 01:53:33.240]  There's a big stack of news here I haven't covered yet.
[01:53:33.740 --> 01:53:34.421]  We will cover it.
[01:53:35.262 --> 01:53:37.585]  Just very briefly, because I didn't plug it in the last hour.
[01:53:38.106 --> 01:53:39.187]  I have made 12 films.
[01:53:40.148 --> 01:53:44.814]  And you heard a firefighter call in about how he's in Tampa, and he got the same training that's in Road to Tyranny.
[01:53:45.350 --> 01:53:50.392]  FEMA comes in and says all Christians are terrorists, the Founding Fathers are terrorists, gun owners are terrorists.
[01:53:50.432 --> 01:53:56.235]  I mean, three minutes of Road to Tyranny, just three minutes of the almost three-hour film, is FEMA teaching that in Kansas City?
[01:53:56.295 --> 01:53:58.956]  I mean, this is the kind of stuff that's in these films.
[01:53:58.996 --> 01:54:01.817]  I mean, people need to know that FEMA is just completely criminal.
[01:54:04.224 --> 01:54:05.845]  We proved the globalists carried out 9-11.
[01:54:06.065 --> 01:54:09.087]  We exposed their master plan in martial law.
[01:54:09.467 --> 01:54:10.888]  My new miniseries film.
[01:54:10.948 --> 01:54:11.849]  Three miniseries.
[01:54:12.309 --> 01:54:13.970]  I mean, three films, one miniseries.
[01:54:14.510 --> 01:54:16.211]  Or one DVD or VHS.
[01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:19.184]  Please get the new film, Martial Law.
[01:54:19.464 --> 01:54:20.664]  Your support is needed.
[01:54:20.744 --> 01:54:25.466]  There's so much more we need to do, but we can't do it if we don't have support.
[01:54:25.486 --> 01:54:31.007]  1-888-253-3139 is the number to get the videos.
[01:54:31.427 --> 01:54:32.428]  We're in an emergency.
[01:54:32.488 --> 01:54:36.429]  We need you to get the videos, make copies, to expose who's behind the terror.
[01:54:36.929 --> 01:54:42.991]  Because they're going to carry out more, and when they do, the people need to know who's behind it, and that can short-circuit and defeat the enemy.
[01:54:44.697 --> 01:54:54.105]  1-888-253-3139, or order the new film, Martial Law, or any of the books or videos, off our secure shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[01:54:54.625 --> 01:55:03.193]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions, all my films, weekly TV reports, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:03.733 --> 01:55:09.018]  And by the way, I'll be on Coast to Coast AM tonight, at like 3 AM Central, 1 AM Central,
[01:55:12.020 --> 01:55:20.926]  ...Pacific with a report on China killing political dissidents and selling their organs and American men and women buying it as facial cream.
[01:55:21.786 --> 01:55:23.588]  We expose stuff like that.
[01:55:24.708 --> 01:55:27.770]  It's real, mainstream news, but our government doesn't care.
[01:55:28.591 --> 01:55:32.753]  Let's go to Mark in wherever he's calling from.
[01:55:32.793 --> 01:55:33.394]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:55:33.854 --> 01:55:34.715]  Mark from Nevada.
[01:55:34.795 --> 01:55:35.315]  Hello, Alex.
[01:55:35.595 --> 01:55:36.876]  Hello, sir.
[01:55:36.936 --> 01:55:39.538]  Speaking of charities, how about this Bush...
[01:55:40.461 --> 01:55:42.202]  Clinton-Katrina Fund.
[01:55:42.943 --> 01:55:44.564]  I'm sure they'll take real good care of your money.
[01:55:44.584 --> 01:55:48.506]  You might as well literally write a $1,000 check to Satan.
[01:55:49.006 --> 01:55:54.790]  Yeah, I mean... I mean, we've got two drug-dealing criminals who are in a league together saying, send us money.
[01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:55.831]  Yeah, I saw that one.
[01:55:55.851 --> 01:56:00.053]  I was thinking, you know, like, that's not going to end up in, like, some neocon campaign or something.
[01:56:00.073 --> 01:56:01.534]  Yeah, I mean, good Lord.
[01:56:01.614 --> 01:56:08.739]  But anyway, yeah, I noticed the governor there of Texas just earlier this morning was saying how wonderful that would be that, you know...
[01:56:09.226 --> 01:56:19.159]  They're getting all these federal troops ready to come in posterior to... Yeah, Apache helicopters can't even carry a bottle of water to somebody, but they're here.
[01:56:19.179 --> 01:56:20.100]  They're going to keep us safe.
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.084]  Yeah, all these federal troops, they're going to be your saviors.
[01:56:23.244 --> 01:56:25.187]  And as a former Marine, Alex, I'll have to say is...
[01:56:25.680 --> 01:56:27.861]  The last thing I want to see is a bunch of federal troops everywhere.
[01:56:27.881 --> 01:56:31.402]  Well, we need federal troops if Houston gets in trouble to hold the food and water back.
[01:56:31.702 --> 01:56:34.263]  Then we'll get some riots, and then FEMA can really take over.
[01:56:34.583 --> 01:56:35.183]  Yeah, that's true.
[01:56:35.223 --> 01:56:37.404]  Got to get us used to troops shooting citizens.
[01:56:37.844 --> 01:56:40.185]  The Hegelian dialectic, yes, exactly.
[01:56:40.425 --> 01:56:41.505]  Did you see Rick Perry, our little...
[01:56:44.713 --> 01:56:45.394]  I'm not going to say it.
[01:56:45.974 --> 01:56:51.599]  Our out-of-control governor on TV going, the terrorists are probably going to attack us.
[01:56:51.659 --> 01:56:54.341]  I mean, that fear-mongering piece of trash.
[01:56:54.661 --> 01:56:57.484]  I missed that one, but yeah, you talk about fear-mongering.
[01:56:57.544 --> 01:57:02.588]  One thing you were talking about, all these movie scripts that they put into movies ahead of time.
[01:57:03.064 --> 01:57:17.309]  I think another big reason, it's not even so much to flaunt it, but it's a good discrediting mechanism, because, you know, you see something like that on television, and, like, say you watch the Lone Gunman episode, and then you start talking about it, you're like, oh, you just got that from a movie, you know?
[01:57:18.069 --> 01:57:21.671]  Yeah, I mean, not only did the Lone Gunman, I appreciate your call, good points, Mark.
[01:57:21.691 --> 01:57:22.951]  We'll talk to Kennedy and Skip coming up.
[01:57:22.991 --> 01:57:30.534]  Then we'll get Officer Jack McClam on the transmission with us, and we are going to cover a lot of vital info.
[01:57:30.554 --> 01:57:31.034]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.536 --> 01:57:37.461]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.782 --> 01:57:38.563]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:49.742 --> 01:57:50.383]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.043 --> 01:57:52.124]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.825 --> 01:57:53.905]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.566 --> 01:57:55.387]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.147 --> 01:57:57.048]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.068 --> 01:58:01.672]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.892 --> 01:58:06.015]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.877 --> 01:58:11.500]  Waging war on corruption, crashing into the lives of disinformation.
[01:58:11.520 --> 01:58:18.005]  We're going to continue to talk about the aftermath of Katrina, and now we have this new hurricane barreling
[01:58:18.701 --> 01:58:19.521]  Down on us.
[01:58:20.402 --> 01:58:24.844]  Very, very, very serious situation with Rita.
[01:58:25.004 --> 01:58:26.925]  And we see the same federal response.
[01:58:27.466 --> 01:58:29.427]  FEMA jamming communications for police.
[01:58:29.467 --> 01:58:30.827]  FEMA not letting food and water in.
[01:58:31.127 --> 01:58:32.408]  FEMA cutting police lines.
[01:58:32.448 --> 01:58:33.128]  FEMA looting.
[01:58:34.069 --> 01:58:35.690]  Now, their normal criminal behavior.
[01:58:35.710 --> 01:58:38.911]  We have a big article where they hire hardcore criminals to run FEMA.
[01:58:39.492 --> 01:58:41.653]  I mean, because they'll do criminal things.
[01:58:42.193 --> 01:58:44.374]  The worse the disaster, the more federal control.
[01:58:44.414 --> 01:58:45.835]  That's what this is all about.
[01:58:46.716 --> 01:58:48.416]  Openly getting rid of posse commentatus.
[01:58:48.676 --> 01:58:51.597]  Jack McClam coming up to talk about this and a lot more.
[01:58:51.997 --> 01:58:54.478]  Right now, let's go to Kenny in Florida, then Skip.
[01:58:54.578 --> 01:58:55.418]  Kenny, go ahead.
[01:58:55.998 --> 01:58:56.978]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[01:58:57.278 --> 01:58:58.459]  How are you doing today?
[01:58:59.099 --> 01:58:59.639]  Good, sir.
[01:59:00.019 --> 01:59:09.861]  Just bringing up the latest AP reporting on the historic changes possible with the military's role in domestic emergencies.
[01:59:10.541 --> 01:59:12.602]  It seems that Bush, Rumsfeld...
[01:59:13.303 --> 01:59:17.088]  And Congress is agreeing that it's time that some changes are made.
[01:59:17.208 --> 01:59:19.691]  Yeah, and they add, and fight crime.
[01:59:19.711 --> 01:59:25.618]  And the EU says, everything you say on the phone will be recorded to fight terror and crime.
[01:59:25.638 --> 01:59:28.442]  Look, they've already gotten rid of posse commentatus, basically.
[01:59:28.762 --> 01:59:30.624]  Now they're just taking off the gloves.
[01:59:32.633 --> 01:59:43.916]  Rita from Rumsell has said he hasn't made any recommendations to Bush, but among the issues he is examining is the viability of the Posse Comitatus Act, and he calls it a very archaic law.
[01:59:44.597 --> 01:59:51.639]  Now, for those who don't know, we don't need to get rid of Posse Comitatus to have federal troops helping disasters.
[01:59:51.959 --> 01:59:56.740]  They have to get rid of it so they can police and break you up and take your guns, folks.
[01:59:58.341 --> 01:59:59.621]  Don't people understand that?
[02:00:00.362 --> 02:00:13.609]  Yeah, I found that that is very... Folks need to call Congress and say no hate bill, no end to posse commentatus, don't get rid of our labeling on the organic food.
[02:00:13.649 --> 02:00:15.150]  Those are the three big things right now.
[02:00:15.590 --> 02:00:21.013]  Senator John Warner, a Republican from Virginia State... Yeah, Chairman of the Armed Services Committee at Peace of Health.
[02:00:21.233 --> 02:00:25.716]  He stated that he believes the time has come that we reflect on the posse commentatus act as well.
[02:00:26.536 --> 02:00:29.698]  So it's obvious that they're...
[02:00:30.319 --> 02:00:38.661]  Using these hurricanes as further abilities to take away these protections.
[02:00:38.801 --> 02:00:39.921]  Does that make you mad?
[02:00:41.002 --> 02:00:42.602]  Of course.
[02:00:42.822 --> 02:00:44.142]  Do you see that as a threat?
[02:00:44.942 --> 02:00:45.123]  Sure.
[02:00:45.983 --> 02:00:58.306]  I think that they're more of a threat than any rogue Arab terrorist or any small insurrections that the public could do that would cause problems.
[02:00:58.566 --> 02:00:59.726]  Our founders told us what the
[02:01:00.542 --> 02:01:04.966]  The most likely threat to our republic would be, and that would be from our own government.
[02:01:05.206 --> 02:01:06.527]  Yeah, it's the government's the threat.
[02:01:06.547 --> 02:01:07.187]  It always is.
[02:01:07.247 --> 02:01:08.048]  It's big and bad.
[02:01:08.108 --> 02:01:09.489]  It's got the pinnacles to do it.
[02:01:09.949 --> 02:01:14.152]  That's the number one threat if you've got your head screwed on straight, the very folks that say give up all your freedoms.
[02:01:14.493 --> 02:01:20.217]  What do you think of the SAS officers being caught shooting Iraqi police, posing as Arabs with a truck full of bombs?
[02:01:21.398 --> 02:01:24.340]  More frightening than the fact that they actually carried that was the fact that
[02:01:24.778 --> 02:01:27.779]  How quiet it has been in the mainstream reporting.
[02:01:28.079 --> 02:01:29.240]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:35.643]  And then when the local police wouldn't give them up, they sent in tanks to the Basra police station.
[02:01:36.043 --> 02:01:41.105]  Broke the jail down using helicopters and tanks and everything else to rescue them.
[02:01:41.425 --> 02:01:42.846]  And again, they caught Israelis.
[02:01:43.326 --> 02:01:46.808]  But of course, the British government says that they'll investigate it for us.
[02:01:46.928 --> 02:01:48.969]  Oh, everything's fine.
[02:01:48.989 --> 02:01:50.029]  There's one other thing, too.
[02:01:51.010 --> 02:01:54.071]  That long story about those tourists that made their way out of...
[02:01:54.693 --> 02:01:55.714]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:02:05.701 --> 02:02:13.364]  Yeah, no, no.
[02:02:13.404 --> 02:02:15.284]  It's not about food and water.
[02:02:15.304 --> 02:02:29.229]  It's about dominating us, letting us know who the boss is, not letting us have food and water, making things as bad as possible, then letting the other sheep outside the containment area see this, but only see the, oh, we need more government.
[02:02:30.180 --> 02:02:31.382]  See, we screwed up.
[02:02:31.723 --> 02:02:32.404]  Don't worry.
[02:02:32.484 --> 02:02:37.172]  FEMA's... Folks, I got FEMA on video saying the Founding Fathers are bad.
[02:02:37.532 --> 02:02:38.734]  America is bad.
[02:02:40.016 --> 02:02:41.559]  You understand, they're terrorists.
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:43.302]  They are the terrorists.
[02:02:46.613 --> 02:02:49.474]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.735 --> 02:02:51.315]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.655 --> 02:02:56.318]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.658 --> 02:03:03.401]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.721 --> 02:03:04.502]  We're good to go.
[02:03:04.522 --> 02:03:05.062]  We're good to go.

[02:03:47.309 --> 02:03:48.370]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.690 --> 02:03:51.472]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.752 --> 02:03:55.894]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.314 --> 02:03:57.155]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.475 --> 02:04:02.038]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.518 --> 02:04:04.640]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.141 --> 02:04:19.835]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.875 --> 02:04:26.942]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:27.282 --> 02:04:31.685]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[02:04:33.926 --> 02:04:34.126]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:46.013 --> 02:04:52.379]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:52.599 --> 02:04:57.603]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[02:04:57.944 --> 02:05:05.871]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.011 --> 02:05:13.057]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:13.257 --> 02:05:14.459]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:14.619 --> 02:05:18.003]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:18.063 --> 02:05:19.185]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:19.485 --> 02:05:20.747]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:20.947 --> 02:05:27.796]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:05:27.897 --> 02:05:30.360]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[02:05:33.543 --> 02:05:34.503]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:05:34.523 --> 02:05:37.686]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:37.706 --> 02:05:40.789]  All right, we've got about 52 minutes left here on this Thursday edition.
[02:05:59.176 --> 02:06:26.339]  As Hurricane Katrina bears down on the Texas coast, where 30% of the gasoline you put in your car is refined from crude oil, as well as about 30%, the press is reporting the statistics here, right around 32% of the goods, much of them raw materials, are brought into ports on the Texas Gulf Coast.
[02:06:27.185 --> 02:06:28.986]  So very, very serious.
[02:06:29.066 --> 02:06:32.328]  They're talking about just major economic problems from this.
[02:06:33.308 --> 02:06:36.790]  But the big question is, will FEMA lock the city down again?
[02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:41.233]  Will they jam the Houston Police Department's communications?
[02:06:41.333 --> 02:06:43.954]  Will they get away with it in plain view?
[02:06:44.574 --> 02:06:50.878]  As Katrina came into New Orleans that first night, FEMA openly jammed all police communications.
[02:06:51.518 --> 02:06:53.099]  Two-thirds of the police walked off.
[02:06:54.028 --> 02:06:54.268]  Thank you.
[02:06:54.308 --> 02:06:54.589]  Thank you.
[02:07:12.330 --> 02:07:14.492]  Which now they say, get rid of posse commentatus.
[02:07:14.532 --> 02:07:16.113]  They don't need to get rid of posse commentatus.
[02:07:16.413 --> 02:07:17.734]  They have troops come in and give aid.
[02:07:18.235 --> 02:07:25.360]  Only to federalize, only to have the military carry out law enforcement activities and gun confiscations.
[02:07:26.081 --> 02:07:35.768]  And that's ongoing in New Orleans, and we have the NRA and the Second Amendment Foundation having to file suit against the city and the feds to stop the gun confiscations.
[02:07:35.788 --> 02:07:37.449]  So we're here, folks.
[02:07:37.830 --> 02:07:38.290]  Don't look for...
[02:07:39.093 --> 02:07:39.553]  Up for help.
[02:07:39.733 --> 02:07:41.694]  Even if the police try to help you, FEMA will stop them.
[02:07:42.094 --> 02:07:43.574]  The question is, will they do that again?
[02:07:43.654 --> 02:07:58.777]  And a man who can give us some expertise on this is Officer Jack McClam, police and military against the New World Order, founder and head out there in KMEI, Idaho, in the High Rocky Mountains, up in one of those Christian communities up there.
[02:07:59.357 --> 02:08:02.838]  And he's just got tens of thousands of members and folks that give him intel.
[02:08:03.498 --> 02:08:06.619]  And we're honored to have Jack McClam on with us today.
[02:08:06.679 --> 02:08:06.879]  Jack?
[02:08:07.845 --> 02:08:11.266]  It's good to be with you very much, brother.
[02:08:11.686 --> 02:08:25.050]  Yes, I was just looking over our list here of about 20 different acts that FEMA carried out to block rescue efforts and delivery of vital necessities to the people.
[02:08:25.110 --> 02:08:27.771]  So you're right on target, Alex.
[02:08:28.425 --> 02:08:34.931]  FEMA was there to make sure that the rescue attempts and the rescuers didn't get in to do their job.
[02:08:35.251 --> 02:08:37.173]  Jack, every once in a while we get a bad phone with you.
[02:08:37.193 --> 02:08:40.977]  We're going to reconnect with you during the break, but can you talk right into the phone for us?
[02:08:41.637 --> 02:08:44.560]  Okay, I'm talking right into the phone right now.
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:45.321]  That's a little bit better.
[02:08:45.581 --> 02:08:47.883]  Please go over some of those examples of what they did.
[02:08:48.835 --> 02:08:50.656]  Okay, you mentioned a few there.
[02:08:50.896 --> 02:09:02.599]  Well, you remember the one where FEMA, Chicago contacted FEMA and wanted to send something like 80 trucks down there immediately, and FEMA said just send one truck.
[02:09:03.559 --> 02:09:07.260]  FEMA turned back volunteer sheriff deputies and medical teams.
[02:09:08.121 --> 02:09:13.022]  FEMA barred morticians from entering New Orleans to pick up the dead bodies.
[02:09:14.389 --> 02:09:20.533]  FEMA blocked that 500-boat citizen flotilla from delivering aid.
[02:09:20.573 --> 02:09:27.057]  The citizens had come in with just hundreds of boats with water and everything the people needed, and they blocked that.
[02:09:27.357 --> 02:09:32.600]  Also, the 1,500 firemen got there, and they were told, now it's time for your week-long sexual harassment training.
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:34.881]  But meanwhile, the city was on fire.
[02:09:35.141 --> 02:09:35.462]  Yes.
[02:09:36.062 --> 02:09:41.205]  FEMA failed to utilize that Navy ship with 600-bed hospital staff
[02:09:42.526 --> 02:09:45.468]  A hospital ship with 600 beds on board.
[02:09:45.488 --> 02:09:48.771]  While people sat for five days in the hospitals dying.
[02:09:49.071 --> 02:09:50.672]  That's right.
[02:09:50.692 --> 02:09:57.397]  And, of course, you already mentioned that FEMA cut the local emergency communications phone lines for the police and the fire department.
[02:09:58.538 --> 02:10:03.682]  They turned away experienced firefighters that were coming in from other areas, told them to go away.
[02:10:04.443 --> 02:10:09.527]  Walmart even had supply trucks there within hours, and FEMA turned them back.
[02:10:10.293 --> 02:10:14.816]  FEMA prevented the Coast Guard from delivering diesel fuel.
[02:10:15.156 --> 02:10:17.157]  So FEMA really was doing their job.
[02:10:17.377 --> 02:10:21.980]  They really did do a good job for what they're mandated to do, and that's set up martial law.
[02:10:22.140 --> 02:10:22.721]  That's right.
[02:10:22.841 --> 02:10:28.784]  Yes, caused so much chaos that the people demand martial law or will accept it.
[02:10:29.004 --> 02:10:30.885]  And this is exactly what was done there.
[02:10:30.925 --> 02:10:39.971]  FEMA just continued for days and days to refuse any aid or rescuers there to make the crisis as bad as they could.
[02:10:40.771 --> 02:10:50.679]  So we know what's coming, Alex, and a lot of our police and soldiers understand that today, too, as we're getting more mail from our police and soldiers and email and so forth, too.
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:11:01.447]  Jack, I want to go over this with you, but at the same time, they caught earlier this week British SAS, as I heard you covering yesterday,
[02:11:02.644 --> 02:11:14.657]  Caught with a car full of bombs, explosives, dressed up with fake eyelashes and fake... not eyelashes, fake eyebrows and fake mustaches and beards, shooting Iraqi policemen.
[02:11:15.197 --> 02:11:20.303]  They got captured and were caught with all the bombs and fit the descriptions of others that have been out bombing.
[02:11:21.023 --> 02:11:24.327]  And the British had released them and they said, no, these men are terrorists.
[02:11:25.007 --> 02:11:33.529]  And so the British government sent in ten tanks and two helicopters and blew the jail up and released over 150 people, killed quite a few people.
[02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:51.092]  And then the media just kind of ignores this thing hidden in plain view and we've caught Israelis two separate times shooting at official Marine Corps bases, rocketing them, dressed up as Arabs and the Marines catch them and beat them up and they're ordered to release them to attack again.
[02:11:51.372 --> 02:11:52.873]  Jack, why would they do something like that?
[02:11:53.073 --> 02:11:53.753]  Well, I...
[02:11:55.213 --> 02:12:10.184]  I talked on my show about being in the war during the Vietnam War and we had guys there as we've had in each war and as we have in Iraq today, even American soldiers that are used as special teams
[02:12:10.856 --> 02:12:20.660]  To go in and create some kind of a criminal act, like a bombing, assassination or something, Alex, and blame it on the opposition.
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:32.004]  The government can point the finger at whoever they want to to topple our regime or to destroy a group that's active against the team they want in running the country.
[02:12:32.524 --> 02:12:38.667]  You know, we put in these tin-pot dictators, the American government does, that'll obey
[02:12:39.347 --> 02:13:02.761]  The internationalists that run our country obey their orders and so we have to a lot of times have teams of guys that will go in and dress like and act like the opposition to commit some of these crimes so we can point the finger at the group that we want to psychologically put down in the minds of the masses of the people of that nation.
[02:13:02.861 --> 02:13:04.962]  So this is exactly what's going on over there.
[02:13:05.022 --> 02:13:07.764]  I have a picture on my wall here as I mentioned yesterday
[02:13:08.676 --> 02:13:22.940]  One such friend of mine in the military, who was one of those guys, that he would do anything the government told him to do, regardless of how immoral or unlawful or murderous, he was one of those people.
[02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:35.363]  And I keep this picture on my wall here to remind me all the time, Alex, that it is the brainwashing that many of these soldiers go through, and I should say police officers do today,
[02:13:36.235 --> 02:13:52.403]  That makes them believe that they have to obey their government and carry out any order that they're given because the government sees the big picture and the private citizens, the great unwashed out there, don't see the big picture.
[02:13:52.843 --> 02:13:54.504]  And it's all for the greater good.
[02:13:54.704 --> 02:14:01.247]  And so if Bill Clinton and George Bush want to collect money for people and keep it themselves, it must be because they're good people.
[02:14:01.687 --> 02:14:02.027]  Yes, it must be.
[02:14:02.047 --> 02:14:07.892]  And if they want to bring in heroin and cocaine, it must be for a good reason, because if we don't control it, the evil commies will.
[02:14:07.972 --> 02:14:15.679]  And if the government wants to put mercury in the vaccines and knowingly brain damage children, as their own documents admit it, it must be for a good reason.
[02:14:15.719 --> 02:14:27.129]  And if FEMA, you know, they tell FEMA people, who by the way are former special forces, or some of them are just crooks right out of prison, there's been articles on that, if they need to cut police lines and not let food in, I'm sure they've got a good reason, Jack.
[02:14:27.609 --> 02:14:39.213]  Well it is true and then also they love to find those in the military and in law enforcement that have the same political philosophy as they do because then they don't have to brainwash them.
[02:14:39.253 --> 02:14:53.699]  They'll go along with promoting this globalist antichrist system and that's always wonderful when they find those individuals among our ranks because they'll just do of course they'll do it because they believe in the political philosophy of setting up this
[02:14:54.224 --> 02:14:57.206]  Well, Jack, how are they getting away with it?
[02:14:57.226 --> 02:15:01.128]  I mean, right out in plain view of everybody, FEMA did sabotage.
[02:15:01.528 --> 02:15:08.353]  Three parishes had to post armed sheriff's deputies to defend against, quote, FEMA sabotage.
[02:15:08.933 --> 02:15:18.639]  But that just gets glazed over, and now we hear FEMA's going to get even more power and more funding, and we're going to get rid of posse commentatus, and just no more freedom because FEMA screwed up.
[02:15:19.319 --> 02:15:21.080]  I mean, it's just so obvious, Jack.
[02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:37.886]  That's right, brother, and the only way they can do it is that in almost 98%, 99% of the political offices at the state house level, the governor's office, and the Congress and the Senate,
[02:15:38.502 --> 02:15:49.785]  They have these globalists that believe in the actual program of this world government system and they understand the necessity for doing these things to push us in that direction.
[02:15:50.506 --> 02:15:54.187]  And then the other way is the media is completely controlled.
[02:15:54.567 --> 02:16:00.889]  The mainline media is controlled today and they don't have to worry about these stories getting out.
[02:16:01.449 --> 02:16:04.510]  It's just like the scam going on right now
[02:16:05.276 --> 02:16:20.428]  With Kennedy, you know, we call him here Killer Kennedy, the Senator Kennedy that came out yesterday vehemently against this new appointment of Bush for Chief Justice of the United States.
[02:16:20.988 --> 02:16:30.696]  And, of course, that will cause all the Republicans and all the Christians to side with this appointee.
[02:16:32.060 --> 02:16:36.625]  They know how to do things psychologically to manipulate the populace.
[02:16:36.665 --> 02:16:48.518]  They know if Kennedy comes out and says this guy is wrong, I'm not going to vote for him, that the majority of the people then will be on the side of getting this man in as Supreme Court Justice.
[02:16:48.678 --> 02:16:52.000]  Well, it's the same thing with Clinton and his global government initiative.
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:53.281]  I mean, that's what it's called, folks.
[02:16:53.881 --> 02:16:57.703]  And he comes out and criticizes the Bushes when it's actually the whole Bush agenda.
[02:16:58.163 --> 02:17:02.386]  And then that suddenly makes Bush look moderate, and then his agenda sails through.
[02:17:02.406 --> 02:17:08.369]  Yes, and the appointee, the man up for the appointment is...
[02:17:09.008 --> 02:17:11.469]  A leftist to the extreme.
[02:17:11.829 --> 02:17:13.909]  And so Kennedy is his buddy.
[02:17:14.169 --> 02:17:16.350]  But if he knows... And Tex Mars!
[02:17:16.430 --> 02:17:19.510]  If Kennedy comes out against him, then he'll get the appointment.
[02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:27.432]  Well, Tex Mars doesn't make stuff up, and he's got the intel that Mr. Roberts is not very conservative.
[02:17:27.912 --> 02:17:36.914]  Oh, he's not, and also very much behind the homosexual agenda that the population control people want to promote in this government, too, and in this nation.
[02:17:37.174 --> 02:17:38.074]  Well, we'll be right back.
[02:17:38.903 --> 02:17:42.144]  Yeah, well, gay prostitutes in the White House at all hours.
[02:17:42.244 --> 02:17:43.205]  It's Christian.
[02:17:45.886 --> 02:17:47.727]  Will taking vitamins make you healthy?
[02:17:47.807 --> 02:17:48.367]  Guess what?
[02:17:48.487 --> 02:17:49.807]  God didn't make a vitamin tree.
[02:17:49.867 --> 02:17:53.949]  He combined and proportioned the nutrients we need for total health and pure whole foods.
[02:17:54.229 --> 02:17:57.010]  Unfortunately, eating properly is difficult in today's world.
[02:17:57.090 --> 02:18:02.713]  We must find organic foods, ensure their freshness, buy them, prepare them raw, then eat and fully digest them.
[02:18:02.873 --> 02:18:06.314]  Most of us cannot complete all those steps, and thus we remain malnourished.
[02:18:06.634 --> 02:18:08.855]  URI International has the perfect solution.
[02:18:09.095 --> 02:18:19.478]  URI grows foods organically in the world's richest soil, harvests them at their peak, and dries them to powder in seconds at temperatures below 88 degrees Fahrenheit, locking in 100% of their nutrients.

[02:18:47.842 --> 02:18:52.324]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:52.664 --> 02:18:56.767]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:57.067 --> 02:18:57.607]  We listened.
[02:18:57.907 --> 02:19:02.890]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:03.170 --> 02:19:03.650]  We listened.
[02:19:04.050 --> 02:19:07.072]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:07.512 --> 02:19:08.052]  We listened.
[02:19:08.512 --> 02:19:11.834]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power
[02:19:11.894 --> 02:19:12.254]  We're good.
[02:19:38.409 --> 02:19:41.990]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:19:42.010 --> 02:19:45.551]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:48.192 --> 02:19:49.373]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:49.773 --> 02:19:55.274]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:19:55.835 --> 02:19:56.335]  That's right.
[02:19:56.655 --> 02:19:58.936]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:19:59.056 --> 02:20:06.418]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:06.972 --> 02:20:14.679]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:15.119 --> 02:20:19.964]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:20:20.604 --> 02:20:23.607]  If you'd like to take a look at gold free retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:26.209 --> 02:20:26.649]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:49.827 --> 02:20:57.254]  On February 29, 1892, the United States of America's Supreme Court declared us a Christian nation.
[02:20:58.335 --> 02:21:08.004]  However, over recent years, for the last three decades, there's been a deliberate war on Christianity in America to wipe out our heritage from the minds of our people.
[02:21:08.925 --> 02:21:15.511]  The First Amendment to the Constitution guarantees us religious freedom, and yet it's under attack today.

[02:21:52.494 --> 02:21:54.835]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:55.195 --> 02:22:00.876]  I've got a whole host of news items I want to get Jack McClam's take on.
[02:22:01.256 --> 02:22:06.777]  And coming up in the next segment, skip on that, but we'll go to Jeff and Rick and Darren and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:22:06.797 --> 02:22:08.057]  But we've got to go to your calls quickly.
[02:22:08.677 --> 02:22:12.038]  But during this segment, you know, Jack McClam, military veteran,
[02:22:12.850 --> 02:22:16.512]  He was a highly decorated police officer in Phoenix, Arizona history.
[02:22:16.972 --> 02:22:20.013]  Also became the most fired when he refused to lie on police reports.
[02:22:22.074 --> 02:22:26.416]  To the police and military out there listening, everything we've talked about over these years is now happening.
[02:22:26.897 --> 02:22:29.238]  All the preparations, all the documents we read.
[02:22:30.458 --> 02:22:31.659]  People think we're psychic.
[02:22:31.699 --> 02:22:33.520]  No, we were going off their own documents.
[02:22:34.526 --> 02:22:54.979]  And, Jack, I'd like you to talk to the military and the police, listening right now, about the type of international crime families and the crime syndicate that we're dealing with and what their goals are and the questions they've got to ask themselves and the decisions they've got to make about serving this system and, quote, just following orders.
[02:22:56.920 --> 02:22:57.280]  Yes.
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:09.525]  Well, brother, that's what we've done here for 24 years now at Aid to Bet Police Military Newsletter on Constitutional Issues and our international group now, Police and Military Against the New World Order.
[02:23:10.065 --> 02:23:10.986]  And that is to...
[02:23:13.117 --> 02:23:34.914]  Awaken our brothers and sisters in uniform out there that contrary to what many people think today, about 90% we have figured out, about 90-93% somewhere in there, are good, decent Americans in uniform that have just been brainwashed like we've all seen happen at our police academies.
[02:23:35.661 --> 02:23:40.144]  These regional police academies like in Arizona... Jack, I gotta add this.
[02:23:40.424 --> 02:23:44.907]  A lot of SS officers that would stomp a baby's brains out wouldn't steal a Deutschmark.
[02:23:47.558 --> 02:23:49.499]  They would help little old ladies across the street.
[02:23:49.519 --> 02:23:51.119]  They'd go to church two nights a week.
[02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:56.301]  They were, for every other way, good people, but they believed the brainwashing.
[02:23:56.602 --> 02:24:01.363]  They believed the brainwashing, and it's been going on here in America now.
[02:24:02.084 --> 02:24:15.949]  I noticed it the first time I could notice it in 1976 when I went into the police academy, and I couldn't understand why they were telling these young, impressionable minds, 20- and 21-year-old people...
[02:24:16.730 --> 02:24:19.571]  Good Americans that took the job for the right reason.
[02:24:19.611 --> 02:24:22.632]  They came into law enforcement to serve and protect the people.
[02:24:23.252 --> 02:24:40.858]  But what I saw in that 16 weeks of becoming a police officer in Phoenix in 1976, Alex, was that we were purposely separated psychologically from the people on the street with such comments as, you are no longer citizens, you're an entity of government.
[02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:41.760]  We're good to go.
[02:24:41.780 --> 02:24:42.581]  We're good to go.
[02:25:06.761 --> 02:25:20.237]  From my military background and also business background that I was involved in in Los Angeles successfully, that it is better to be able to empathize and to be able to
[02:25:22.270 --> 02:25:24.151]  Be a part of the citizenry.
[02:25:24.251 --> 02:25:25.312]  Help them.
[02:25:25.492 --> 02:25:27.853]  I couldn't understand it originally, Alex.
[02:25:27.953 --> 02:25:32.516]  I didn't understand why we were being psychologically separated from the people.
[02:25:32.536 --> 02:25:43.622]  Of course, we do today because, as they said in the police academy, they said you're going to be asked to do things one day you won't like to do and you won't want to do, but if you don't do them...
[02:25:44.282 --> 02:25:51.166]  Your nation will fall, and you don't want your America to fall and for us to not have freedom any longer.
[02:25:51.546 --> 02:25:57.010]  So you must do the things we tell you to do, even if you don't like to do them and you don't want to do them.
[02:25:57.070 --> 02:26:00.091]  And of course, at that time, they wouldn't tell us what those things were.
[02:26:00.352 --> 02:26:00.652]  Jack?
[02:26:01.152 --> 02:26:01.392]  Yes?
[02:26:01.833 --> 02:26:07.636]  Now, one of the main rules of special forces and force multiplication is you do interface with the people.
[02:26:08.169 --> 02:26:09.350]  You do work with the people.
[02:26:09.390 --> 02:26:10.671]  That's where the real power is.
[02:26:10.731 --> 02:26:13.393]  So they were automatically trying to segregate.
[02:26:13.853 --> 02:26:16.095]  Then the police start not liking the people.
[02:26:16.115 --> 02:26:17.836]  The people start not liking the police.
[02:26:18.296 --> 02:26:20.458]  Then they can drive an even bigger wedge in there.
[02:26:20.778 --> 02:26:21.338]  That's right.
[02:26:21.458 --> 02:26:32.226]  And all of a sudden you have the same situation that we've shared with so many thousands of officers over these 24 years, is that the East German police and military...
[02:26:32.706 --> 02:26:42.631]  That would shoot their own citizens in the back, the women and children and men climbing over the wall trying to get the freedom, were not the dregs of society, Alex.
[02:26:42.771 --> 02:26:43.472]  You know this.
[02:26:43.552 --> 02:26:53.717]  They were the most patriotic police and soldiers they had because they'd been brainwashed to believe that it was for the greater good that nobody get over that wall.
[02:26:53.857 --> 02:26:59.840]  And they could be counted on because of their extreme patriotism to kill their own fellow countrymen
[02:27:00.905 --> 02:27:07.289]  For the greater good of society as a whole, as I'm sure they were told there the same way we're told today.
[02:27:07.689 --> 02:27:08.670]  Jack, we've got a break.
[02:27:08.910 --> 02:27:13.693]  Folks, the founding fathers that FEMA teaches police are terrorists now.
[02:27:13.713 --> 02:27:14.654]  We have it on video.
[02:27:15.374 --> 02:27:18.476]  The founding fathers said a patriot does not trust their government.
[02:27:18.956 --> 02:27:25.480]  You keep it small, you control it, because history shows it is a dangerous servant and a fearful master.
[02:27:26.864 --> 02:27:28.526]  Use your common sense.
[02:27:28.566 --> 02:27:29.567]  You're being used.
[02:27:29.968 --> 02:27:31.109]  You're being manipulated.
[02:27:31.570 --> 02:27:33.812]  We'll be right back to talk more about this with Jack McClam.
[02:27:33.832 --> 02:27:34.313]  Take your calls.
[02:27:35.834 --> 02:27:36.775]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.236 --> 02:27:38.818]  The empire's on the run.

[02:27:50.684 --> 02:27:56.068]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:27:56.309 --> 02:27:57.830]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:27:57.870 --> 02:28:00.112]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:28:00.312 --> 02:28:03.795]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:28:04.195 --> 02:28:04.836]  We're good to go.

[02:29:45.462 --> 02:29:46.984]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:29:47.144 --> 02:29:48.285]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:29:48.465 --> 02:29:51.888]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:29:51.988 --> 02:29:52.409]  Phenol.
[02:29:52.729 --> 02:29:59.796]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:30:00.356 --> 02:30:04.240]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:30:04.360 --> 02:30:04.801]  Fragrance?
[02:30:05.181 --> 02:30:09.946]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:30:10.066 --> 02:30:14.751]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:30:14.991 --> 02:30:17.474]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[02:30:17.794 --> 02:30:21.196]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:30:21.356 --> 02:30:24.917]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[02:30:46.958 --> 02:30:47.779]  We're good to go.
[02:31:16.007 --> 02:31:23.691]  They were trying to leave New Orleans in areas that were never underwater from their middle-class homes, and they had their hunting rivals and shotguns in the back.
[02:31:24.351 --> 02:31:33.316]  The police under FEMA control with FBI goon squads that are leading them pulled them over, stole their guns out of the back, and sent them on down the road.
[02:31:33.776 --> 02:31:36.097]  I mean, they don't give you a receipt, nothing!
[02:31:37.038 --> 02:31:38.819]  But you just keep living in denial.
[02:31:39.339 --> 02:31:42.601]  People are, oh, George Bush wouldn't allow that!
[02:31:43.342 --> 02:31:43.702]  Okay.
[02:31:44.223 --> 02:31:47.885]  The Second Amendment Foundation, the National Rifle Association, joined with individual gun owners.
[02:31:48.385 --> 02:31:49.906]  I'm sure they'll lose the case on purpose.
[02:31:50.487 --> 02:31:51.707]  Second Amendment Foundation's good.
[02:31:51.747 --> 02:31:53.909]  The National Rifle Association, folks, is controlled.
[02:31:54.529 --> 02:31:57.791]  Joined with individual gun owners in Louisiana Thursday morning, filing a motion.
[02:31:58.191 --> 02:32:11.680]  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana seeking a temporary restraining order to stop authorities in and around the city of New Orleans from seizing firearms from private citizens in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
[02:32:12.253 --> 02:32:16.174]  So you try to leave your house with the jewelry, the guns, the papers.
[02:32:16.274 --> 02:32:18.754]  They just... We're not here to help you.
[02:32:18.774 --> 02:32:19.715]  Pull over, please.
[02:32:19.755 --> 02:32:20.815]  Get out of the car.
[02:32:21.375 --> 02:32:23.015]  This is a pretty nice shotgun.
[02:32:23.876 --> 02:32:25.396]  Please, that belonged to my grandfather.
[02:32:25.736 --> 02:32:26.596]  I have a friend that's happened to.
[02:32:27.296 --> 02:32:27.817]  Get back!
[02:32:27.977 --> 02:32:28.457]  Get back!
[02:32:28.517 --> 02:32:28.837]  Hold on.
[02:32:28.897 --> 02:32:29.897]  You know, drawing down on them.
[02:32:30.637 --> 02:32:34.038]  Just get on down the road, boy, or I'll throw your bleeper in jail.
[02:32:35.524 --> 02:32:42.649]  Arbitrary gun seizures without warrant or probable cause have been reported during the past three weeks since the Crescent City was devastated by the hurricane.
[02:32:43.510 --> 02:32:49.214]  And it goes on to say that they refused to give police receipts, refused to give them anything.
[02:32:49.954 --> 02:32:52.476]  And it goes on and on for two pages.
[02:32:53.417 --> 02:32:53.977]  Here's another one.
[02:32:53.997 --> 02:32:57.219]  Hurricane victims say guns helped fend off criminals.
[02:32:57.279 --> 02:32:58.220]  This is Reuters.
[02:32:59.381 --> 02:33:02.223]  After the storm came, the carjackers and the burglars came.
[02:33:03.010 --> 02:33:11.580]  They came and the gun battles and the chemical explosions that shook, restored Victorians in New Orleans, Algiers Point neighborhood.
[02:33:14.523 --> 02:33:19.689]  It goes on, the hurricane was a breeze compared with the crime and the terror that followed, said Greg Harris's
[02:33:20.606 --> 02:33:22.629]  Psychotherapist who lives in the battered area.
[02:33:22.809 --> 02:33:37.787]  As life returned to the close-knit neighborhood three weeks after Hurricane Katrina, residents said they hoped their experience could convince political leaders to get serious about the violence and the poor services that have been an unfortunate hallmark of the city.
[02:33:39.053 --> 02:33:45.035]  And it said that after the storm, the Neighborhood Association had to act as law enforcement and emergency response unit.
[02:33:45.355 --> 02:33:48.856]  The city services collapsed and the police force was unable to protect them.
[02:33:49.336 --> 02:34:00.079]  And it says the citizens organized into armed patrols and checked on the elderly, detained and fought off criminals, and helped rescue others.
[02:34:00.439 --> 02:34:02.140]  It goes on for page after page.
[02:34:02.700 --> 02:34:07.201]  They slept on their porches and loaded shotguns and bottled and bolted.
[02:34:08.311 --> 02:34:12.834]  Awake when intruders stumbled onto the aluminum cans they'd scattered on the sidewalk.
[02:34:13.215 --> 02:34:16.217]  Gunshots rang out for days, sometimes terrifyingly close.
[02:34:17.137 --> 02:34:29.426]  And it goes on to talk about how they defended themselves and how the 1,500 neighborhood association fought off literally hundreds of burglary attempts and helped rescue the elderly and share food.
[02:34:29.446 --> 02:34:29.486]  So...
[02:34:31.634 --> 02:34:33.235]  I want to go back to Jack here in a second.
[02:34:33.476 --> 02:34:41.201]  I'm not the best at reading things really fast, so I apologize about the helter-skelter babbling, but I could spend three hours on these two articles alone.
[02:34:42.081 --> 02:34:45.504]  FEMA knowingly jammed police communications.
[02:34:45.544 --> 02:34:46.484]  Things fell apart.
[02:34:46.965 --> 02:34:54.550]  And then when they got all the inner-city people out, they came to the middle-class neighborhoods where people that worked at power plants and worked at the hospitals...
[02:34:56.345 --> 02:34:58.170]  One group of cops is begging them to stay.
[02:34:58.190 --> 02:35:01.177]  The feds come in and say, no, give us your guns and leave.
[02:35:01.218 --> 02:35:04.667]  And they're like, who's going to bandage you when you step on a nail, idiot?
[02:35:07.054 --> 02:35:11.179]  Meanwhile, MasterCard says millions to get no-touch cards to be issued.
[02:35:11.259 --> 02:35:18.186]  Whether you like it or not, MasterCard is going to start issuing RFID chip credit cards to go to the automatic scanning.
[02:35:18.326 --> 02:35:19.067]  Very dangerous.
[02:35:19.588 --> 02:35:24.293]  Then they scan you whenever you come into the store and track your movements and track your purchasing habits.
[02:35:24.894 --> 02:35:25.915]  It's just really bad news.
[02:35:27.103 --> 02:35:31.544]  EU unveils plan to log all electronic phone communication, ABC News.
[02:35:31.924 --> 02:35:40.986]  The European Commission has adopted proposals to log the details of all telephone, internet, and email traffic to combat terrorism and crime.
[02:35:41.606 --> 02:35:42.866]  See, it's crime.
[02:35:43.526 --> 02:35:45.347]  Everything you do will be openly stored.
[02:35:45.407 --> 02:35:46.787]  Our government now already does that, too.
[02:35:48.487 --> 02:35:53.068]  Senators accuse Pentagon of obstructing inquiry on September 11th plot.
[02:35:54.836 --> 02:36:01.280]  And, of course, the FBI blocked the Defense Intelligence from stopping Muhammad Anna because he was CIA.
[02:36:01.961 --> 02:36:04.802]  We have a whole train of people going public about this.
[02:36:05.683 --> 02:36:07.784]  And that's basically it for now.
[02:36:08.204 --> 02:36:13.968]  By the way, it's already raining heavily in New Orleans just from the fringes of Hurricane Rita.
[02:36:14.008 --> 02:36:15.509]  It could cause flooding there.
[02:36:15.549 --> 02:36:16.990]  Three inches of rain in New Orleans.
[02:36:17.590 --> 02:36:20.072]  The recently repaired levees
[02:36:22.213 --> 02:36:36.157]  Jack, thanks for holding while I covered some of that news, but would you like to comment on the citizens defending themselves until FEMA got there to literally get their guns and force them out, and then FEMA was caught looting their homes?
[02:36:37.837 --> 02:36:46.600]  Well, it's old news now that FEMA is there for specific reasons.
[02:36:47.299 --> 02:36:51.782]  And it is not to save the people when they go into an area.
[02:36:51.822 --> 02:36:54.264]  It's to take over federal control of an area.
[02:36:55.305 --> 02:36:58.387]  And one of the first things they want to do is get control of the weapons.
[02:36:58.547 --> 02:37:11.636]  So this is known by most police officers out there that when a martial law is declared or enforced, even though it's not declared, they go get all the guns of the people.
[02:37:12.097 --> 02:37:13.958]  And, of course, this is very dangerous.
[02:37:14.696 --> 02:37:28.435]  Because then the street criminals not the government criminals will come in behind the government criminals when they remove the guns and take everything you've got including your life if you don't have a way to protect yourself.
[02:37:28.515 --> 02:37:28.776]  And so
[02:37:29.562 --> 02:37:39.770]  That's why our police officers with 8 in a Bed and our police and military against the New World Order know that the citizens should never, ever give up their guns.
[02:37:40.111 --> 02:37:40.871]  They should not.
[02:37:41.012 --> 02:37:46.236]  The Founding Fathers, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, made direct statements
[02:37:47.017 --> 02:37:57.548]  That the people should never be debarred, the use of arms, and the strongest reason, Thomas Jefferson said, was to protect themselves from tyranny in their own government.
[02:37:59.090 --> 02:38:03.094]  But also, every police officer listening today knows that
[02:38:03.394 --> 02:38:16.385]  That 98% of the time, we never get there in time to help you when you have a crisis going on in your home, like being attacked or being raped or robbed or anything.
[02:38:16.705 --> 02:38:21.229]  98% of the time, we're there to take the report after it happens.
[02:38:21.369 --> 02:38:23.671]  Jack, the guns make the crime go down.
[02:38:24.191 --> 02:38:32.778]  Evidence here, even in the socialistic Reuters, they admit that these neighborhood associations acted as the police and stopped the looting from spreading.
[02:38:32.878 --> 02:38:33.459]  That's right.
[02:38:33.619 --> 02:38:34.160]  That's right.
[02:38:34.360 --> 02:38:36.162]  And we have many examples of this.
[02:38:36.963 --> 02:38:38.085]  Kennesaw, Georgia.
[02:38:38.465 --> 02:38:48.358]  You know, the old situation, what, 15 years ago when the government in Kennesaw told the people they had to have a gun in every home, crime almost went down to zero.
[02:38:49.159 --> 02:38:51.661]  In that community because the bad guys moved out.
[02:38:52.141 --> 02:38:55.323]  And their crime had exploded because they're a suburb of Atlanta.
[02:38:55.563 --> 02:39:03.088]  But one year after making everyone own a gun, they had a 94%, I believe was the statistic, violent crime drop.
[02:39:03.168 --> 02:39:04.349]  I believe you're right, Alex.
[02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:17.658]  And that's why when we do a survey of police officers among police officers, not the liberal public news out there of the government, but police officers among police officers like the American Federation of Police,
[02:39:18.258 --> 02:39:28.711]  Did a survey among police officers and found out that 97% of them believe the citizens should own and carry guns with them to protect themselves from criminals.
[02:39:29.804 --> 02:39:32.425]  Now, police know that because they live in the real world.
[02:39:32.445 --> 02:39:46.092]  The domesticated yuppie that doesn't have a water filter, has no food, doesn't know what a flak jacket is, doesn't know how to put a fly on a fishing pole, doesn't know how to skin a buck, doesn't know how to wipe their own nose.
[02:39:46.613 --> 02:39:48.113]  They just want our guns, Jack.
[02:39:48.133 --> 02:39:49.694]  Can you believe what buffoons they are?
[02:39:49.954 --> 02:39:58.759]  But I think this New Orleans thing, and now this situation with Houston coming up in the next 48 hours, I think this is in a way being a wake-up call for people.
[02:39:59.159 --> 02:40:03.644]  I like that we were here at our headquarters watching the news.
[02:40:05.166 --> 02:40:17.138]  I think it was one day after Katrina had hit, and it really caused quite a lot of laughter around here and a clapping going on when a lawyer took to the Communist News Network, CNN,
[02:40:18.101 --> 02:40:25.504]  And stated on there, you might have seen him shaking his fist, saying, I'm not leaving my home, and if they come for me, there's going to be a shootout.
[02:40:25.704 --> 02:40:34.047]  So, I mean, he's probably a liberal lawyer, but all of a sudden the Fats hit the fire, and he needs his guns, and he needs to protect his home.
[02:40:34.628 --> 02:40:36.648]  And so this is what happened.
[02:40:38.129 --> 02:40:42.971]  Those that are against guns, we say in law enforcement, are liberals that haven't been mugged yet.
[02:40:43.925 --> 02:40:50.354]  Well, also, Jack, that particular lawyer then, the police took it as a challenge and did swat him when he was asleep.
[02:40:50.774 --> 02:40:57.463]  Again, people dying, people needing help, and because he said that on the news, they went and snuck up and swatted him at night.
[02:40:57.763 --> 02:41:01.208]  But it's okay to have the Israeli ISI company with foreign mercs.
[02:41:01.747 --> 02:41:03.169]  They're patrolling and doing stuff.
[02:41:03.189 --> 02:41:04.691]  It's okay to have Blackwater.
[02:41:05.091 --> 02:41:05.652]  They're doing it.
[02:41:05.932 --> 02:41:08.775]  So the foreign mercs can have guns, Jack, but we can't.
[02:41:09.056 --> 02:41:09.376]  That's right.
[02:41:09.496 --> 02:41:12.279]  I think they said there's 20,000 now mercenaries in there with guns, M16s.
[02:41:17.245 --> 02:41:18.125]  Yeah, the word is...
[02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:45.732]  At first, four legs good, two legs bad.
[02:41:45.752 --> 02:41:49.154]  Then later, when the pigs start walking upright, it's a no.
[02:41:49.714 --> 02:41:52.176]  Actually, four legs good, two legs better.
[02:41:52.196 --> 02:41:54.738]  And then finally, two legs good, four legs bad.
[02:41:54.758 --> 02:41:56.819]  And the pigs are living in the house.
[02:41:57.339 --> 02:41:58.940]  I don't mean that allusion towards police.
[02:42:00.201 --> 02:42:01.562]  The bad guys are pigs.
[02:42:02.402 --> 02:42:06.045]  I think a cop is the well-meaning horse.
[02:42:06.585 --> 02:42:06.886]  That's true.
[02:42:06.926 --> 02:42:08.168]  Yeah, that's a good fitting analogy, Alex.
[02:42:18.576 --> 02:42:20.438]  That seems to be what happens, yes.
[02:42:20.758 --> 02:42:26.864]  Jack, is it painful for you to see the police and military just being so incredibly conned by this criminal system?
[02:42:26.984 --> 02:42:38.476]  Well, that's what's driven me, brother, to stand up and go from being the most honored and awarded officer in the history of Phoenix, Arizona to the most fired officer
[02:42:39.236 --> 02:42:47.418]  In the last 24 years of my volunteer work to try to open the hearts and minds of my fellow police officers and soldiers to their constitutional duty.
[02:42:47.518 --> 02:42:48.618]  I'm driven by this.
[02:42:48.698 --> 02:42:59.440]  Can you briefly tell that story of the little old man standing up and saying, you know, when you were the big community officer and literally like being Saul of Tarsus being knocked off his horse?
[02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:02.821]  Oh my goodness, I'll never ever forget that, Alex.
[02:43:03.521 --> 02:43:06.962]  I was just one officer of the year twice and
[02:43:07.566 --> 02:43:10.707]  I mean my head was so big I could barely get through a door.
[02:43:11.327 --> 02:43:14.268]  I was so successful with the department and I didn't know why.
[02:43:14.709 --> 02:43:25.873]  I'm just an average guy, average educated, but I didn't realize God was putting me in the right place at the right time so many times because of what was coming in my future.
[02:43:26.193 --> 02:43:28.894]  So I was just doing what I was told like every officer.
[02:43:29.815 --> 02:43:30.335]  We're good to go.
[02:43:53.366 --> 02:43:56.088]  There was an 85, 90-year-old man sitting in the back.
[02:43:56.128 --> 02:43:57.370]  Looked like he was sleeping.
[02:43:57.450 --> 02:43:58.450]  Very frail.
[02:43:58.631 --> 02:44:00.872]  Looked like he was just asleep.
[02:44:01.493 --> 02:44:05.696]  And I gave a talk for about an hour and opened it up for questions and answers.
[02:44:06.457 --> 02:44:07.638]  And his hand goes up.
[02:44:07.758 --> 02:44:11.321]  First arm to go up, his little bony arms raving around.
[02:44:11.401 --> 02:44:15.685]  I'm thinking maybe he has to go be excused for the restroom or something because I thought he was asleep.
[02:44:16.446 --> 02:44:19.168]  Well, he asked me a series of questions then.
[02:44:20.089 --> 02:44:21.290]  That just shocked me.
[02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:22.331]  It shocked me.
[02:44:22.351 --> 02:44:23.832]  He asked me if I took an oath.
[02:44:24.452 --> 02:44:27.514]  And I said, well, sure I took an oath as a police officer.
[02:44:27.574 --> 02:44:34.179]  It was the same oath that I took when I was a soldier to defend the Constitution, protect the people's rights, their liberties, and so forth.
[02:44:34.860 --> 02:44:40.183]  And then he asked me, Sonny, he kept calling me, Sonny, Sonny, Sonny.
[02:44:40.343 --> 02:44:42.465]  He said, do you know the law, Sonny?
[02:44:43.294 --> 02:44:49.317]  And I just said, well, yes, I think I know the law.
[02:44:49.357 --> 02:44:50.178]  What's your question?
[02:44:50.218 --> 02:44:50.998]  What's your question?
[02:44:51.658 --> 02:44:57.761]  And so he began to ask me a series of questions about the law, the Bill of Rights.
[02:44:57.801 --> 02:45:00.383]  He asked me, what's the Sixth Amendment to the Bill of Rights?
[02:45:00.443 --> 02:45:01.563]  What's the Fourth Amendment?
[02:45:01.603 --> 02:45:02.944]  What's the Tenth Amendment?
[02:45:02.984 --> 02:45:03.504]  What's this?
[02:45:04.385 --> 02:45:06.606]  And every time I couldn't answer,
[02:45:07.708 --> 02:45:12.014]  I just felt lower and lower and lower, and he kept asking.
[02:45:12.074 --> 02:45:13.135]  I finally stopped him.
[02:45:13.196 --> 02:45:20.706]  I was so embarrassed in front of this group of people, and I said, Sir, please, ask me a question about what I spoke about tonight.
[02:45:20.746 --> 02:45:22.828]  I don't have the answers to what you were saying.
[02:45:23.429 --> 02:45:25.352]  And he said to me, Sonny, he said,
[02:45:25.913 --> 02:45:26.353]  Alex Jones Show!
[02:45:26.373 --> 02:45:26.854]  We're good to go.
[02:45:26.894 --> 02:45:27.214]  I think?
[02:45:48.559 --> 02:45:51.521]  And I kept telling God, I want to forget this man.
[02:45:51.541 --> 02:45:53.562]  He shouldn't have treated me that way.
[02:45:53.602 --> 02:45:54.922]  I didn't deserve that, Lord.
[02:45:55.663 --> 02:45:57.964]  And I would keep praying to forget this old man.
[02:45:58.004 --> 02:46:01.225]  Well, about a month later, I sat up in the middle of the bed at night.
[02:46:01.966 --> 02:46:06.928]  My eyes come open, and it's like a two-by-four hit me in the center of the head.
[02:46:06.948 --> 02:46:13.051]  The lights come on, and in my mind I said, Lord, that old man was right.
[02:46:13.191 --> 02:46:14.132]  I should have known better.
[02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:15.621]  My oath.
[02:46:15.721 --> 02:46:18.683]  I should have known the answers to the questions.
[02:46:18.783 --> 02:46:26.269]  And I went out that next day and got a copy of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for the first time in my adult life.
[02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:27.750]  And I read those things, Alex.
[02:46:28.571 --> 02:46:31.053]  And I realized that that old man was right.
[02:46:31.173 --> 02:46:33.475]  That I was a violator of my oath.
[02:46:34.221 --> 02:46:45.318]  And I thought to myself how easy it is that the people don't know what their rights are the police don't know what their rights are and how easy it is for you to be given an order to violate people's rights
[02:46:46.027 --> 02:46:50.128]  When neither the citizen today or the police even know what those rights are.
[02:46:50.388 --> 02:46:53.049]  Jack, we've got to take some calls, but you're absolutely right.
[02:46:53.089 --> 02:46:59.171]  I mean, America is America because of the rules of the country, because of that Constitution.
[02:46:59.191 --> 02:46:59.692]  That's right.
[02:46:59.772 --> 02:47:01.832]  That Declaration of Independence, that Bill of Rights.
[02:47:02.453 --> 02:47:07.994]  And so America isn't America anymore because we have intentionally had this kept from us.
[02:47:08.094 --> 02:47:09.695]  I want every police officer out there,
[02:47:10.319 --> 02:47:18.321]  I want you to go online, I want you to read the Declaration of Independence, and then ask yourselves, is the government not doing the exact same things that caused us to go to war?
[02:47:18.341 --> 02:47:20.341]  That's right, against the British.
[02:47:20.761 --> 02:47:24.802]  Absolutely, and then I want you to read that Bill of Rights and ask yourselves, are you violating those?
[02:47:25.102 --> 02:47:26.863]  And you're violating every stinking one of them.
[02:47:27.523 --> 02:47:29.263]  And, you know, it's going to get worse and worse.
[02:47:29.303 --> 02:47:31.344]  And listen, the New World Order will flush you down the toilet.
[02:47:31.724 --> 02:47:32.644]  They don't care about you.
[02:47:32.664 --> 02:47:34.524]  Who's up next here, Rick in Nevada or Jeff?
[02:47:35.304 --> 02:47:37.485]  Coming up in just a... Who's up next?
[02:47:38.326 --> 02:47:39.587]  Rick in Nevada, you're on the air.
[02:47:39.607 --> 02:47:40.207]  Go ahead, Rick.
[02:47:41.188 --> 02:47:45.611]  Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish, Louisiana.
[02:47:46.332 --> 02:47:55.779]  When the FEMA disconnected his emergency communication lines, he posted armed guards after reconnecting those lines with orders to shoot to kill.
[02:47:55.859 --> 02:47:58.961]  Is the FEMA there to disconnect those lines again?
[02:47:59.614 --> 02:48:04.861]  I suggest that the sheriff departments all over this country ought to take the same attitude that Sheriff Harry Lee did.
[02:48:04.881 --> 02:48:08.606]  No, no, we've got to warn Houston police, and I wish I was on the radio in Houston.
[02:48:09.127 --> 02:48:12.451]  Well, we're on an affiliate near there, but I wish I could warn the cops.
[02:48:12.491 --> 02:48:15.776]  You know, if everything gets jammed, you've got to go stop the FEMA people.
[02:48:16.196 --> 02:48:16.516]  Yes.
[02:48:16.977 --> 02:48:33.249]  And I suggest that citizens ought to band together and volunteer to help the sheriffs to become deputies and to guard the Communication Alliance, guard the water, to set up roadblocks to prevent FEMA vehicles, whatever it takes.
[02:48:33.589 --> 02:48:36.852]  All right, we're going to talk to a couple more callers on the other side.
[02:48:37.292 --> 02:48:37.892]  Great points.
[02:48:38.093 --> 02:48:38.673]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.865 --> 02:48:50.210]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.390 --> 02:48:54.836]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.956 --> 02:48:59.341]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.381 --> 02:49:00.742]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.523 --> 02:49:06.724]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.804 --> 02:49:13.725]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.845 --> 02:49:15.906]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.226 --> 02:49:26.547]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.848 --> 02:49:29.388]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my
[02:49:29.448 --> 02:49:30.068]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:30.148 --> 02:49:31.709]  Order today and spread the word.

[02:49:58.628 --> 02:50:02.132]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:50:02.312 --> 02:50:02.612]  I think.
[02:50:28.362 --> 02:50:30.444]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:50:30.664 --> 02:50:34.608]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:37.351 --> 02:50:38.292]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.556 --> 02:50:52.478]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:52.718 --> 02:50:54.959]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.159 --> 02:51:01.501]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.841 --> 02:51:02.502]  We're good to go.
[02:51:22.142 --> 02:51:22.703]  We're good to go.
[02:51:55.672 --> 02:52:04.138]  Oh, but we've got to take your rights because of 9-11.
[02:52:04.339 --> 02:52:07.601]  And we've got official government plans to carry out 9-11.
[02:52:07.701 --> 02:52:09.422]  We've caught them doing it in Gladio.
[02:52:10.123 --> 02:52:13.265]  Caught the British, caught the Israelis doing it over in Iraq.
[02:52:13.885 --> 02:52:17.888]  Because again, if we stay there for 10 years, the defense contractors make more money.
[02:52:17.908 --> 02:52:20.891]  See, their goals aren't what they tell you they are.
[02:52:20.951 --> 02:52:22.692]  And when you really get the criminals' goals...
[02:52:23.402 --> 02:52:23.482]  Alex?
[02:52:23.502 --> 02:52:23.682]  Yes, sir.
[02:52:49.980 --> 02:52:50.660]  I'll ask you a question.
[02:52:50.700 --> 02:52:52.121]  Yeah, I just want to ask you a question.
[02:52:52.141 --> 02:52:57.385]  I just want to say, you know, it basically hurts me as a black person in America to see what's happening in New Orleans.
[02:52:58.165 --> 02:53:05.070]  They're basically exploiting people of my descent to see what's going on because this is basically, you know, a big mockery.
[02:53:05.770 --> 02:53:10.674]  You know, because being poor and being black in America, you know, they look at it as a simple thing.
[02:53:10.694 --> 02:53:11.254]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:53:11.946 --> 02:53:15.689]  And the reality is that... Sir, that's a small part of the overall diversion.
[02:53:16.089 --> 02:53:16.830]  Exactly.
[02:53:16.990 --> 02:53:26.978]  You know, and the reality is that, you know, I mean, I think that, I mean, pretty soon, I mean, the way out people were lynched back in the day is being lynched on trees and being put on...
[02:53:27.903 --> 02:53:35.646]  I hear you, Ralph.
[02:53:36.326 --> 02:53:37.147]  We're flat on time.
[02:53:37.187 --> 02:53:37.907]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:53:37.947 --> 02:53:38.647]  We can talk more.
[02:53:39.047 --> 02:53:39.908]  I don't mean to cut you short.
[02:53:39.928 --> 02:53:41.968]  I just want to try to go to Darren and Barrett if we have time.
[02:53:42.469 --> 02:53:44.549]  You know, Jack, they cut the food off.
[02:53:44.629 --> 02:53:45.870]  It did cause some problems.
[02:53:46.350 --> 02:53:49.631]  They did point the cameras at that, but that's really a small part of it.
[02:53:49.891 --> 02:53:51.632]  They're going to lynch all of us, aren't they, Jack?
[02:53:51.852 --> 02:53:58.394]  Yes, there's no respecter of persons among these international prime figures that have control of our government, Alex.
[02:53:58.994 --> 02:54:07.117]  Believe me, if you're not a part of the rich establishment, I mean super, super rich, you're going to go down under this system.
[02:54:07.137 --> 02:54:19.600]  That's why I keep telling the liberal police and soldiers out there and others that you're mistaken thinking there's going to be a chicken in every pot and that it's just going to be peace and harmony on earth under this system.
[02:54:19.640 --> 02:54:20.441]  It never is.
[02:54:20.521 --> 02:54:21.441]  Let's take a call.
[02:54:22.094 --> 02:54:23.415]  Darren in Tennessee.
[02:54:23.435 --> 02:54:24.756]  You're on the air with Jack McClam.
[02:54:24.776 --> 02:54:25.156]  Go ahead.
[02:54:25.417 --> 02:54:26.017]  Hey, Alex Jack.
[02:54:26.237 --> 02:54:27.358]  I've got a question.
[02:54:27.918 --> 02:54:40.668]  With this hurricane stuff going on and everything like it is, they are not only putting National Guard out in those areas, but here in Tennessee, especially in Nashville, when I was watching the news this morning, they were saying that they were considering putting National Guard...
[02:54:41.235 --> 02:54:41.936]  On the streets there.
[02:54:42.316 --> 02:54:46.038]  I heard Bush on the radio say all 50 states were federalized last week.
[02:54:46.078 --> 02:54:51.342]  This is all being used to take the economy and feed it through a few contractors' pockets.
[02:54:51.722 --> 02:54:54.023]  It's all an excuse to get rid of posse commentatus.
[02:54:54.064 --> 02:54:54.584]  Jack McClam?
[02:54:56.247 --> 02:54:56.788]  That's right.
[02:54:56.828 --> 02:54:57.788]  That is the goal.
[02:54:58.008 --> 02:54:59.709]  We're supposed to be under FEMA.
[02:54:59.749 --> 02:55:01.750]  That's supposed to be our new government.
[02:55:01.910 --> 02:55:11.495]  And it's going to be a military rule situation because of the fear and the chaos in the streets that our government is creating on purpose.
[02:55:12.256 --> 02:55:12.856]  Very bold.
[02:55:13.696 --> 02:55:14.677]  They're getting very bold.
[02:55:16.258 --> 02:55:17.778]  They're making their move, my friend.
[02:55:17.798 --> 02:55:19.599]  I mean, it's just one thing after another.
[02:55:19.619 --> 02:55:21.240]  I appreciate your call.
[02:55:21.340 --> 02:55:22.741]  Barrett, real quick in Texas.
[02:55:22.781 --> 02:55:23.201]  Go ahead.
[02:55:23.881 --> 02:55:25.102]  I have to, McClendon.
[02:55:25.791 --> 02:55:26.993]  I'm a big fan of your work.
[02:55:27.134 --> 02:55:29.297]  I've been listening to your show for a while.
[02:55:29.337 --> 02:55:30.479]  My question was this.
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:32.383]  I actually had a few points to make.
[02:55:33.885 --> 02:55:38.273]  First of all, the US government is basically outsourcing all of its
[02:55:39.034 --> 02:55:39.655]  Great point.
[02:55:39.715 --> 02:55:41.316]  You've got to call me back tomorrow.
[02:55:41.356 --> 02:55:44.558]  Type in police and military against the New World Order into Google.
[02:55:44.598 --> 02:55:46.679]  You'll get Jack McClam's great website.
[02:55:47.019 --> 02:55:51.102]  Jack, I want to thank you for coming on, but really, foreign troops, Mexican, Dutch, and ISI Israelis,
[02:56:09.134 --> 02:56:11.455]  Yes, and the people love it so, Alex.
[02:56:11.555 --> 02:56:12.356]  The people love it.
[02:56:13.196 --> 02:56:15.778]  And again, we said New Orleans was just a beta test.
[02:56:15.938 --> 02:56:16.558]  Yes, it was.
[02:56:16.998 --> 02:56:17.919]  Jack, thanks for coming on.
[02:56:17.939 --> 02:56:19.240]  Thank you for all you do, Alex.
[02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:19.780]  You bet.
[02:56:19.880 --> 02:56:21.101]  Folks, God bless you all.
[02:56:21.381 --> 02:56:22.321]  Don't give up your liberty.
[02:56:22.341 --> 02:56:23.042]  You'll get tyranny.
