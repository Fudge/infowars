[00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:06.170]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.891]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:09.711]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.371 --> 00:00:11.192]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.932 --> 00:00:12.892]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.492 --> 00:00:17.473]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.673 --> 00:00:21.814]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.555 --> 00:00:31.517]  Hurricane Katrina gathers strength and accelerates towards the Texas coast.
[00:00:33.047 --> 00:00:40.010]  Projected to make landfall somewhere between Corpus Christi and Galveston, Texas.
[00:00:43.312 --> 00:00:53.397]  In 1909, many more thousands died in Galveston when a hurricane hit and submerged the entire island that have died in the aftermath of Katrina.
[00:00:54.838 --> 00:00:57.039]  Hurricane Rita gathers strength.
[00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.241]  Hurricane Rita has gained strength as it heads across the Gulf of Mexico
[00:01:02.236 --> 00:01:15.847]  After battering the coastline of Cuba and the southern tip of Florida, Rita is expected to hit Texas later this week and has been upgraded twice within hours to the Category 4 storm.
[00:01:16.908 --> 00:01:24.674]  Already a Category 4, sooner than thought by forecasters, with winds exceeding 130 miles per hour.
[00:01:25.294 --> 00:01:31.219]  It could become, in the incredibly hot waters of the Central Gulf, a Category 5 and then
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.242]  If it hits land as a 3 or 4 or even a 2, it could be devastating.
[00:01:37.262 --> 00:01:41.103]  If it hits as a 5, unbelievable devastation.
[00:01:42.084 --> 00:01:45.965]  Tens of thousands of people are evacuating coastal towns.
[00:01:46.646 --> 00:01:53.188]  New Orleans is also on high alert as the storm could cause flooding once again in the low-lying city.
[00:01:53.908 --> 00:01:58.370]  Troops and supplies are being brought to the region to deal with the hurricane's aftermath.
[00:02:00.177 --> 00:02:16.421]  The BBC's Alistair Lighthead in Miami says state and federal authorities are planning for something as big as Hurricane Katrina, which devastated parts of Louisiana and Mississippi last month, and this time they want to be sure they are properly prepared.
[00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:31.461]  And the evacuees of Hurricane Katrina, the largest portion of being in coastal cities or near coastal cities like Houston, are now going to be moved to Austin that has already absorbed 10,000 refugees, as they were called.
[00:02:33.158 --> 00:02:40.966]  Oil companies have stepped up their evacuation of rigs in the region and the city of Galveston in Texas has been completely evacuated.
[00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:56.541]  Several thousand Louisiana residents who found shelter in Texas after their homes were wrecked by Hurricane Katrina are being uprooted again and moved to Arkansas and Tennessee and Austin and Dallas and San Antonio I would add.
[00:02:57.162 --> 00:03:12.212]  And 500 buses are standing by ready to evacuate people from New Orleans whose protective levees the Army Corps of Engineers are reporting can only withstand another three inches of rain.
[00:03:13.693 --> 00:03:22.899]  We will continue to watch Hurricane Katrina throughout the broadcast and continually on this network and obviously on stations tuning into this broadcast.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.361]  When we get back
[00:03:27.208 --> 00:03:28.969]  I guess they could say when it rains it pours.
[00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:41.916]  When we get back, House approves anti-hate bill, freedom of speech now in jeopardy, passage of thought crimes bill spells doom to free talk radio.
[00:03:42.897 --> 00:03:46.399]  Reverend Ted Pike isn't joking when he gives you that analysis.
[00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:52.382]  And we've got Ted, Pastor Pike, joining us in about 30 minutes from now.
[00:03:54.506 --> 00:03:55.406]  Also, the U.S.
[00:03:55.486 --> 00:03:59.587]  State Department says the New Testament is anti-Semitic.
[00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:01.628]  Needs to be restricted.
[00:04:01.648 --> 00:04:03.468]  Needs to be banned.
[00:04:04.728 --> 00:04:06.629]  Yes, we're not joking, my friends.
[00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:16.271]  Last year, finally got the charges dropped this year, seven pastors faced 47 years in prison for praying on their knees on a street corner.
[00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:19.672]  Now illegal in America.
[00:04:20.332 --> 00:04:21.032]  Not a joke.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.543]  You thought it was illegal for the Supreme Court to steal your property without just compensation.
[00:04:25.903 --> 00:04:28.545]  You thought they couldn't have forced psychological testing, forced drugging.
[00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:32.748]  You thought they would never promote, enforceably, complaining you with chips.
[00:04:32.768 --> 00:04:33.749]  It's all happening.
[00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:38.273]  Pentagon blocks able danger testimony.
[00:04:38.293 --> 00:04:40.534]  How they protected Al-Cieda.
[00:04:42.236 --> 00:04:47.079]  More developments on British Special Forces caught carrying out staged terror attacks in Iraq.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.081]  Red handed.
[00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:52.551]  Experts say Louisiana levees should have held.
[00:04:52.571 --> 00:04:54.652]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:54.752 --> 00:04:58.675]  InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:02.108 --> 00:05:09.492]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:05:09.772 --> 00:05:14.515]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:20.378]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:05:20.618 --> 00:05:25.140]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.523]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:05:32.543 --> 00:05:36.084]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:05:36.124 --> 00:05:37.065]  And much, much more.
[00:05:37.245 --> 00:05:39.747]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:05:39.967 --> 00:05:46.732]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:09.852]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:10.072 --> 00:06:21.335]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.555 --> 00:06:24.216]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.556 --> 00:06:28.657]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:06:28.857 --> 00:06:31.000]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.023]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.243 --> 00:06:39.271]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.511 --> 00:06:45.179]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:07:02.184 --> 00:07:04.665]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:19.290]  Did you know that there's a secret group that has been trying to destroy all ordered government, eliminate private property, abolish inheritance, rid the nation of patriotism in the family, abolish religion and establish a world government?

[00:08:01.318 --> 00:08:06.960]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:10.781 --> 00:08:18.083]  Waging war on corruption, crashing through the lives and disinformation.
[00:08:19.464 --> 00:08:21.004]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:21.024 --> 00:08:22.425]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:22.905 --> 00:08:26.206]  Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:27.266 --> 00:08:30.107]  The abominable, un-American,
[00:08:30.976 --> 00:08:45.279]  Bill of Rights attacking carcinogenic ADL, Anti-Defamation League, has successfully gotten the House to pass their Thought Crimes Bill.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:59.783]  And ladies and gentlemen, it was the ADL that helped orchestrate Christians being arrested for kneeling and praying in an outfest up in Philadelphia.
[00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:03.327]  And they almost got 47 years in prison.
[00:09:03.347 --> 00:09:07.348]  It was being billed as terrorism to pray.
[00:09:08.108 --> 00:09:10.028]  The Bush administration had a U.S.
[00:09:10.088 --> 00:09:19.290]  Attorney, through Chertoff, viciously go after them and a higher level judge ordered it thrown out.
[00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:21.031]  They were taking it to court.
[00:09:21.071 --> 00:09:24.691]  They were going to spend 47 years in prison for praying.
[00:09:25.112 --> 00:09:27.172]  This is the equivalent of Communist China.
[00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:31.973]  And I know there's a lot of leftists out there that are like, good, put those haters in prison.
[00:09:32.634 --> 00:09:33.815]  What's wrong with you people?
[00:09:34.635 --> 00:09:47.225]  You're not going to have your right to skip around and have your little demonstrations against George Bush, your buddy, if Christians don't have the right to protest homosexuals.
[00:09:48.626 --> 00:09:54.171]  And I've told the neocon, phony Christians this, if you march out and try to take the rights
[00:09:56.488 --> 00:10:01.234]  of the Socialists and others, you're going to lose your rights to protest and demonstrate.
[00:10:03.898 --> 00:10:10.107]  By the way, the Texas Civil Rights publication, I'll dig it out here in a second,
[00:10:11.673 --> 00:10:13.094]  It's somewhat prestigious.
[00:10:13.574 --> 00:10:16.855]  Came out with really a half-hearted hit piece on me.
[00:10:17.216 --> 00:10:18.116]  I shouldn't be too mean.
[00:10:18.136 --> 00:10:23.899]  You know, they say, well, Alex does a lot of good work, but he's wrong about protesting the D.C.
[00:10:23.939 --> 00:10:25.680]  State's Mexican Independence Parade.
[00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.241]  You know, are people allowed to celebrate the revolution, Alex?
[00:10:29.902 --> 00:10:31.682]  You know, I wasn't there protesting that.
[00:10:32.203 --> 00:10:38.726]  I was protesting that it was a decidedly un-American, anti-American revolution against the U.S.
[00:10:38.786 --> 00:10:39.066]  march.
[00:10:39.938 --> 00:10:47.663]  By a large portion of those in attendance, and I got their t-shirts, and I got their admissions, and I got their comments, this is Oslon, and they're taking over.
[00:10:48.983 --> 00:10:49.924]  And I don't appreciate it.
[00:10:52.225 --> 00:10:58.209]  And then the individual that wrote the article said, Oh, Mr. Jones, I have a question for you.
[00:10:58.289 --> 00:11:03.812]  I wonder, I wonder if it'd be okay if they're, would you be against them having their demonstration?
[00:11:04.092 --> 00:11:05.133]  Would you ban it?
[00:11:06.522 --> 00:11:12.926]  Therefore implying that I'm against free speech and that I was against them having, being able to have a demonstration.
[00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:24.552]  When I've said a million times, and the person obviously listens to the show, and they had quotes in there I've used, you know, only on air about, I've got a nose for corruption, a nose for oppression.
[00:11:24.572 --> 00:11:28.374]  You know, they had quotes that I've stated here on the air, the person's obviously a listener.
[00:11:29.034 --> 00:11:35.278]  You know full well I've said, I'll fight to the death for Khalid Mohammed to say, kill every white person on the face of the earth.
[00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:40.314]  I'll fight to the death for the right of Meche to say, you know, kill all whites.
[00:11:41.155 --> 00:11:43.776]  But it doesn't mean that I agree with it.
[00:11:44.977 --> 00:11:49.981]  I'll fight to the death for the Klan's right to say, ship all the blacks back to Africa.
[00:11:50.661 --> 00:11:55.665]  I don't agree with it, but I'll... I'll... Because if we don't have the free speech, folks, we have nothing!
[00:11:56.225 --> 00:12:02.830]  So how dare you imply, I wonder if Mr. Jones wanted the whole thing bad?
[00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:03.450]  Hmm?
[00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:04.090]  Hmm?
[00:12:04.351 --> 00:12:04.611]  Hmm?
[00:12:06.027 --> 00:12:08.348]  You know, you've got to invent things against me.
[00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:12.550]  You've got to make things up about me.
[00:12:13.811 --> 00:12:15.552]  And it's not going to work.
[00:12:17.513 --> 00:12:23.496]  Last night, my wife was out of printer ink, and the only place open at 11 o'clock at night was Target.
[00:12:24.196 --> 00:12:34.561]  So I popped in over at Target, and the place was about to close, but it was full of people, and I had what?
[00:12:36.138 --> 00:12:47.864]  Five Hispanics walk up to me and shake my hand and four of them mentioned separate males, uh, males and their buying things.
[00:12:49.185 --> 00:12:53.387]  Five Hispanic males walk up to me, four of them mentioning they saw me on the news and they agreed with me.
[00:12:53.927 --> 00:12:56.428]  So, just let me give you the news flash.
[00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:59.230]  Your propaganda isn't working!
[00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:03.432]  So you can try whatever you want, it isn't working.
[00:13:05.109 --> 00:13:07.250]  People have been listening to this show far too long.
[00:13:07.510 --> 00:13:09.030]  They know I stand up for the little guy.
[00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:10.931]  They know I know what I'm talking about.
[00:13:11.371 --> 00:13:14.272]  And you're not going to divide people, and it's not going to work.
[00:13:14.912 --> 00:13:16.872]  So, that's the message to you.
[00:13:17.412 --> 00:13:22.474]  When you attack me, the community, especially in Central Texas, will turn against you.
[00:13:23.354 --> 00:13:25.995]  Your propaganda is a failure!
[00:13:28.035 --> 00:13:29.956]  You have lost again!
[00:13:29.976 --> 00:13:33.637]  And it's not going to work.
[00:13:34.375 --> 00:13:37.636]  And I lanced a boil with the help of all the folks that showed up.
[00:13:37.656 --> 00:13:40.036]  And I want to commend those that did show up.
[00:13:40.076 --> 00:13:41.216]  I haven't thanked you enough for that.
[00:13:41.616 --> 00:13:49.198]  When we protested the un-American elements of the Desistace Parade Saturday, I want to thank you for coming.
[00:13:49.218 --> 00:13:51.738]  But we did lance the boil to a certain extent.
[00:13:53.519 --> 00:13:58.160]  We have not extracted all of the scrofulous detritus.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:04.061]  It is still, this country is still very infected, obviously, but it's a good start.
[00:14:05.245 --> 00:14:07.087]  Alright, enough of my disgusting analogies.
[00:14:08.768 --> 00:14:15.053]  And I am digressing, but it all ties into the move to literally destroy this country.
[00:14:15.914 --> 00:14:17.576]  To literally destroy free speech.
[00:14:18.516 --> 00:14:20.438]  And what the ADL is up to.
[00:14:20.498 --> 00:14:22.119]  And folks, the House has now passed it.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.683]  I mean, draconian speech laws like they got in Canada.
[00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:30.987]  Very, very scary.
[00:14:31.027 --> 00:14:32.008]  It's going to the Senate.
[00:14:33.502 --> 00:14:42.126]  Now, we've beat this legislation five separate times, but we're by the hair of our chinny-chin-chin on this one.
[00:14:45.447 --> 00:14:50.550]  I'm going to get into the other news, but I've got to repeat this public service announcement here, this warning.
[00:14:51.290 --> 00:14:54.811]  Katrina has accelerated and now been upgraded to Category 4.
[00:14:55.312 --> 00:14:58.073]  They were saying it was going to make landfall sometime Friday.
[00:14:58.792 --> 00:15:02.837]  But if it continues to accelerate, it could make landfall Thursday night or Friday morning.
[00:15:03.398 --> 00:15:05.781]  Or it could slow down and come in Saturday.
[00:15:06.322 --> 00:15:09.366]  It could turn to the south and hit Mexico and South Texas.
[00:15:09.987 --> 00:15:15.414]  Or it could continue right on its current path in the low pressure zone that's going to suck it right in.
[00:15:16.289 --> 00:15:21.594]  Right into the area between Corpus Christi and Houston.
[00:15:21.994 --> 00:15:24.596]  Houston is above sea level, but it's still very low.
[00:15:24.616 --> 00:15:29.621]  Houston has flooded severely in the past, and masses of deaths have occurred.
[00:15:29.641 --> 00:15:32.984]  I mean, we'll have flash flooding here in Central Texas.
[00:15:33.044 --> 00:15:35.466]  A few years ago, 35 people died in two hours.
[00:15:36.146 --> 00:15:41.131]  So it's very dangerous, and there's going to be flooding all over Texas.
[00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.051]  Because of this.
[00:15:43.751 --> 00:15:45.212]  And so just be ready for it.
[00:15:45.272 --> 00:15:48.934]  And if you live in the coastal areas, you need to get out.
[00:15:49.374 --> 00:15:59.899]  And you need to get out now, unless you are in a fortified, very strong structure that can withstand 130 mile an hour winds.
[00:15:59.939 --> 00:16:01.280]  It could come ashore that strong.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.841]  It's that strong right now.
[00:16:03.641 --> 00:16:05.722]  And it better be 10, 15 feet above on stilts.
[00:16:12.074 --> 00:16:13.615]  If I was you, I'd get out of there.
[00:16:15.157 --> 00:16:23.084]  If I was you, I would, uh, say, Vaya con Dios to, uh, Oslo Wago, see you mañana, and I would get in the car and get out of there.
[00:16:24.625 --> 00:16:28.909]  Because, uh, these hurricanes are getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:16:28.929 --> 00:16:34.774]  I mean, admittedly, in the last ten years, the hurricanes are just getting more and more severe.
[00:16:36.815 --> 00:16:38.435]  So Hurricane Rita gathers strength.
[00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:45.597]  Hurricane Rita has gained strength as it heads across the Gulf of Mexico after battering the coastline of Cuba and the southern tip of Florida.
[00:16:45.617 --> 00:16:55.119]  It's expected to hit Texas later this week and has been upgraded twice within hours to the Category 4 storm with winds exceeding 130 miles per hour or 210 kilometers an hour right now.
[00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:04.631]  Good reason to not live on the coast.
[00:17:04.651 --> 00:17:05.512]  You know, I love the ocean.
[00:17:05.552 --> 00:17:06.252]  I love the coast.
[00:17:06.292 --> 00:17:08.932]  But, I mean, it's just coastal regions get battered.
[00:17:09.953 --> 00:17:11.633]  House approves anti-hate bill.
[00:17:11.813 --> 00:17:13.293]  Freedom of speech now in jeopardy.
[00:17:13.353 --> 00:17:14.674]  Passage of thought crimes bill.
[00:17:15.034 --> 00:17:17.454]  Spells doom to free talk radio.
[00:17:19.074 --> 00:17:20.115]  Asher Pike coming up.
[00:17:20.375 --> 00:17:20.775]  U.S.
[00:17:21.235 --> 00:17:23.735]  State Department says New Testament is anti-Semitic.
[00:17:25.696 --> 00:17:26.916]  Moves to restrict it.
[00:17:28.396 --> 00:17:31.137]  Pentagon blocks able danger testimony.
[00:17:32.188 --> 00:17:59.593]  By the way, before I get into this, anybody that doubts they're moving to restrict the New Testament, what happened with Mel Gibson, the champion of promoting good, wholesome films, and the champion of promoting anti-New World Order films, and pro-rebellion-against-tyranny films, he makes The Passion of the Christ, and is savaged for it.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:07.283]  Of course, it blew up in the globalist's faces and didn't work, and the movie made $600 million in counting.
[00:18:08.904 --> 00:18:10.884]  What is it, like $700 million now or something?
[00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:11.465]  I mean, I don't know.
[00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:17.387]  But, uh, it just shows that it's all a bluff.
[00:18:18.027 --> 00:18:23.870]  Buying into their propaganda, buying into the demonization of free speech, it's a bluff!
[00:18:26.627 --> 00:18:26.967]  What is it?
[00:18:27.007 --> 00:18:29.048]  The second biggest grossing film of all time?
[00:18:29.088 --> 00:18:31.770]  And that was like eight, nine months ago when I saw the statistics.
[00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:37.773]  I believe, I may have heard out of the corner of my ear on the radio, it may be the all-time biggest grosser now, worldwide.
[00:18:40.535 --> 00:18:49.620]  And they laughed at him, they scorned him, they attacked him, they tried to get some of the evangelicals to attack him, saying it was a piece of Catholic propaganda.
[00:18:50.481 --> 00:18:51.441]  None of that worked.
[00:18:52.322 --> 00:18:53.162]  None of it worked.
[00:18:54.223 --> 00:18:54.463]  And now,
[00:18:56.440 --> 00:18:59.941]  The film is either number one or number two highest grossing ever.
[00:19:02.421 --> 00:19:05.161]  And again, the point is the people want the truth.
[00:19:05.301 --> 00:19:06.962]  The people want reality.
[00:19:07.022 --> 00:19:08.642]  The people want history.
[00:19:08.882 --> 00:19:10.402]  The people are hungry for it.
[00:19:11.623 --> 00:19:13.703]  They're not hungry for a bunch of garbage.
[00:19:14.563 --> 00:19:15.583]  They're sick of it.
[00:19:17.404 --> 00:19:18.524]  They're tired of it.
[00:19:19.584 --> 00:19:21.524]  This broadcast is evidence of that.
[00:19:22.644 --> 00:19:26.145]  Number one alternative radio show in the country.
[00:19:26.801 --> 00:19:28.122]  And I'm not tootin' my horn.
[00:19:28.462 --> 00:19:29.744]  It's a great responsibility.
[00:19:29.824 --> 00:19:30.945]  I don't do the best job.
[00:19:33.086 --> 00:19:34.748]  But, we should all take heart.
[00:19:34.888 --> 00:19:36.769]  I'm only one show, folks.
[00:19:37.610 --> 00:19:38.611]  One group of websites.
[00:19:42.574 --> 00:19:52.983]  Dwarfing, in our reach, some of the biggest TV stations, some of the biggest, no it's true, some of the biggest newspapers in the country.
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:58.644]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with masses of news and masses of information.
[00:19:58.984 --> 00:20:00.325]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.447 --> 00:20:05.149]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:07.712]  Though without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[00:20:07.952 --> 00:20:09.693]  But there's more to oxygen than just breathing.
[00:20:09.953 --> 00:20:15.578]  Two-time Nobel Prize winner Otto Warburg stated, where cells get enough oxygen, cancer will not, cannot occur.
[00:20:15.838 --> 00:20:20.202]  Atmospheric oxygen levels commonly dip as low as 10% in indoor and urban environments.
[00:20:20.482 --> 00:20:23.324]  Is it then any wonder we have so much chronic disease in today's world?
[00:20:23.504 --> 00:20:25.585]  We all need the Unmedical Miracle Oxygen.

[00:21:03.112 --> 00:21:04.154]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:21:04.474 --> 00:21:07.278]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:07.539 --> 00:21:11.705]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:12.125 --> 00:21:12.946]  So what do you do?
[00:21:13.267 --> 00:21:17.834]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:18.314 --> 00:21:20.435]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:20.935 --> 00:21:21.835]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:21:22.235 --> 00:21:25.956]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:21:26.256 --> 00:21:35.619]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:04.071]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:04.471 --> 00:22:09.933]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:10.514 --> 00:22:11.014]  That's right.
[00:22:11.334 --> 00:22:13.615]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:13.935 --> 00:22:21.099]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:21.659 --> 00:22:29.366]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:29.806 --> 00:22:34.671]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:35.291 --> 00:22:38.314]  If you'd like to take a look at gold pre-retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:41.076 --> 00:22:45.221]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:45.601 --> 00:22:45.861]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.881 --> 00:22:47.803]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:47.863 --> 00:22:48.184]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.464 --> 00:22:48.744]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.454 --> 00:23:03.276]  Will taking vitamins make you healthy?
[00:23:03.376 --> 00:23:03.976]  Guess what?
[00:23:04.056 --> 00:23:05.397]  God didn't make a vitamin tree.
[00:23:05.437 --> 00:23:09.501]  He combined and proportioned the nutrients we need for total health and pure, whole food.
[00:23:09.801 --> 00:23:12.563]  Unfortunately, eating properly is difficult in today's world.
[00:23:12.683 --> 00:23:18.268]  We must find organic foods, ensure their freshness, buy them, prepare them raw, then eat and fully digest them.
[00:23:18.448 --> 00:23:21.911]  Most of us cannot complete all those steps, and thus we remain malnourished.
[00:23:22.231 --> 00:23:24.413]  URI International has the perfect solution.
[00:23:24.693 --> 00:23:35.039]  URI grows foods organically in the world's richest soil, harvests them at their peak, and dries them to powder in seconds at temperatures below 88 degrees Fahrenheit, locking in 100% of their nutrients.

[00:24:21.434 --> 00:24:23.316]  Information is our ultimate weapon.
[00:24:23.376 --> 00:24:33.207]  In my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State is a three-hour miniseries covering the latest police state developments.
[00:24:34.019 --> 00:24:41.782]  And we spent an hour on how the military-industrial complex carried out 9-11 and why they did it as a pretext for global empire.
[00:24:41.802 --> 00:24:47.383]  And then we spent an hour looking at the Luciferian death cult that controls it.
[00:24:47.864 --> 00:24:50.384]  Who we're fighting and what their final goals are.
[00:24:51.345 --> 00:24:52.805]  Very important film.
[00:24:52.845 --> 00:24:53.886]  It's a mini-series.
[00:24:53.946 --> 00:24:56.246]  Three films for the price of one.
[00:24:56.746 --> 00:25:01.288]  It is Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:03.754]  You need to have it.
[00:25:03.794 --> 00:25:06.956]  Also, American Dictators, Road to Tyranny.

[00:25:31.727 --> 00:25:32.228]  Every week.

[00:25:45.838 --> 00:25:46.879]  Please take action.
[00:25:46.919 --> 00:25:47.800]  Please take advantage of it.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:55.666]  And your purchase of the videos and books and materials makes our ministry, our operations against the New World odor possible.
[00:25:56.167 --> 00:25:56.507]  Alright.
[00:25:57.938 --> 00:26:04.663]  Pentagon blocks able danger testimony, and I cannot do justice to this without giving you some background.
[00:26:06.425 --> 00:26:14.071]  How many FBI agents have been told, if you tell the public what you know, or if you give a speech, or if you write a book about what you know, you'll be arrested.
[00:26:16.432 --> 00:26:18.774]  And they're ordered under national security not to talk.
[00:26:19.775 --> 00:26:21.857]  How many embassy heads have we interviewed?
[00:26:21.877 --> 00:26:23.378]  How many FBI agents have we interviewed?
[00:26:23.398 --> 00:26:25.279]  How many other lawyers have we interviewed?
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.141]  Before they get the gag orders,
[00:26:27.904 --> 00:26:29.165]  We had David Shippers on.
[00:26:30.586 --> 00:26:33.788]  They were ordered directly not to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:34.668 --> 00:26:40.492]  They were ordered directly, we have the transcript, the audio is posted on the site, they were ordered not to defend this country.
[00:26:41.732 --> 00:26:44.254]  They were ordered then not to tell the public about it.
[00:26:45.703 --> 00:26:47.164]  Well, I mean, here's another example.
[00:26:47.204 --> 00:26:49.226]  Pentagon blocks able-danger testimony.
[00:26:49.246 --> 00:26:50.267]  They were going to have the testimony.
[00:26:50.587 --> 00:27:08.021]  Pentagon lawyers have ordered five members of the able-danger intelligence team not to testify at an open Senate hearing scheduled for today about information they developed on lead 9-11 hijacker Mohammed Adab a year before the 9-11 attacks.
[00:27:08.061 --> 00:27:14.866]  Well, if you actually read what happened, they were going to bust him, and they knew he was a terrorist, and they were ordered to let him back into the country and leave him alone.
[00:27:15.623 --> 00:27:24.888]  Just like Sybil Edmonds was looking at classified info after the fact and told to destroy it, it's the same story.
[00:27:25.908 --> 00:27:37.534]  Lieutenant Colonel Schaefer, who was the Defense Intelligence Agency's liaison officer to Abel Danger, said he was preparing his testimony for the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday afternoon, but he was told that the hearing will be classified, it will be secret.
[00:27:38.402 --> 00:27:39.303]  Hours after Lt.
[00:27:39.343 --> 00:27:48.609]  Schaefer revealed that he'd been muzzled, Defense Department spokesman Brian Whitman told the New York Times that open testimony on Abel Danger will not be appropriate.
[00:27:51.151 --> 00:27:54.273]  And now they're just blocking Abel Danger testimony, period.
[00:27:56.735 --> 00:28:02.278]  And again, this goes back to 1999, Clinton ordering the protection of Adam.
[00:28:03.219 --> 00:28:05.981]  And the neocons get on the radio and go, see, it was Bill Clinton!
[00:28:07.262 --> 00:28:09.183]  And I said two weeks ago, I said, you watch.
[00:28:09.823 --> 00:28:11.544]  Bush is going to block this testimony.
[00:28:12.385 --> 00:28:13.665]  Protecting Bill Clinton!
[00:28:13.685 --> 00:28:16.327]  Do you understand that, folks?
[00:28:16.347 --> 00:28:17.027]  I mean, I know you do.
[00:28:18.288 --> 00:28:23.030]  But it's so simple, it's even hard for some people to grasp it out there who are neocon worshippers.
[00:28:23.631 --> 00:28:24.311]  Bush worshippers.
[00:28:25.367 --> 00:28:28.629]  Bush did all the same stuff himself once he got in office.
[00:28:28.989 --> 00:28:30.570]  He reauthorized W1999.
[00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:40.554]  You know, people go, well, Bush signed W1999 ordering FBI and CIA and Defense Intelligence not to stop Al Qaeda or Hamas.
[00:28:41.835 --> 00:28:45.997]  But so did Bill Clinton, so see, uh... Well, yeah, that makes it even worse.
[00:28:46.077 --> 00:28:48.698]  It shows it's a unified policy.
[00:28:49.519 --> 00:28:51.720]  Al Qaeda is the CIA.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.561]  Al Qaeda is the globalist terror arm.
[00:28:55.484 --> 00:29:04.848]  We just caught Special Air Services, the British Delta Force, carrying out terror attacks.
[00:29:05.268 --> 00:29:16.613]  They've been caught over and over again, this time red-handed, with wigs and fake beards on, out shooting and killing people with explosives to carry out, you know, these fake truck bombs, these car bombs.
[00:29:17.294 --> 00:29:24.777]  And when they got caught and captured by the police, a bunch of tanks went in and attacked the jail and took them out.
[00:29:26.454 --> 00:29:27.155]  They have to!
[00:29:29.276 --> 00:29:32.058]  They can't have their people being captured.
[00:29:32.098 --> 00:29:37.262]  You go, why on earth would SAS be undermining the situation?
[00:29:37.322 --> 00:29:43.546]  Because the longer they stay there, the more money the defense companies make!
[00:29:44.186 --> 00:29:45.247]  It's real simple!
[00:29:45.307 --> 00:29:47.669]  Two plus two equals four!
[00:29:48.249 --> 00:29:49.390]  We'll be right back!
[00:29:51.772 --> 00:29:52.752]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.153 --> 00:29:54.654]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.652 --> 00:29:58.434]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.537 --> 00:30:10.402]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[00:30:10.662 --> 00:30:13.024]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[00:30:13.264 --> 00:30:15.225]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[00:30:15.565 --> 00:30:20.929]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[00:30:21.309 --> 00:30:21.789]  We're good to go.
[00:30:41.717 --> 00:30:44.859]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.581]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:30:47.781 --> 00:30:49.162]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:30:49.363 --> 00:30:54.146]  See the Keychain Attachable Nuke Alert at nukealert.com.
[00:30:54.386 --> 00:30:56.708]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[00:30:56.828 --> 00:30:57.308]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[00:31:01.537 --> 00:31:07.759]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.899 --> 00:31:14.061]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.341 --> 00:31:22.783]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.023 --> 00:31:30.045]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.345 --> 00:31:35.168]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.388 --> 00:31:40.792]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:41.132 --> 00:31:44.214]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.555 --> 00:31:52.540]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.140]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.426 --> 00:32:02.968]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:32:03.128 --> 00:32:04.249]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:04.450 --> 00:32:07.853]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:07.973 --> 00:32:08.394]  Phenol?
[00:32:08.714 --> 00:32:15.842]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:16.122 --> 00:32:20.246]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:20.346 --> 00:32:20.787]  Fragrance?
[00:32:21.167 --> 00:32:25.910]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:30.732]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:32:30.953 --> 00:32:33.494]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[00:32:33.774 --> 00:32:37.196]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:32:37.336 --> 00:32:40.918]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:32:41.078 --> 00:32:43.479]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:44.440]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:54.353]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[00:32:54.553 --> 00:32:56.756]  Call Cal-Ben toll free 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:33:06.324 --> 00:33:16.612]  Coming up in about four minutes, Pastor Ted Pike will be with us in the middle of the next hour and will take your calls.
[00:33:17.373 --> 00:33:20.836]  House approves anti-hate bill, freedom of speech now in jeopardy.
[00:33:21.436 --> 00:33:28.662]  Passage of thought crimes bill spells doom to free talk radio and being able to read out of the Old or New Testament.
[00:33:30.043 --> 00:33:34.427]  This is not a joke, this is not a drill, and by the way, if you want to watch his hate crimes video,
[00:33:35.157 --> 00:33:37.438]  We'll tell you how to get it later, but I need to carry it.
[00:33:37.978 --> 00:33:52.103]  But he was kind enough to let us post it on PrisonPlanet.tv, the entire film, an amazing documentary covering the full magnitude of what the ADL is up to for PrisonPlanet.tv folks.
[00:33:53.783 --> 00:33:56.504]  But before we go to Pastor Hank, who is patiently holding,
[00:33:57.344 --> 00:34:00.646]  Invalidly leading the charge now for, I guess, the fifth year in a row.
[00:34:00.666 --> 00:34:05.870]  He's been doing it for over a decade, but it's really been hot and heavy combat in the Info War in the last five years.
[00:34:06.710 --> 00:34:08.912]  They've tried to pass it five times now in the last five years.
[00:34:08.932 --> 00:34:10.033]  This is the fifth time.
[00:34:11.153 --> 00:34:18.498]  Before we go to Pastor Pike with the attack on the First Amendment, the vicious, savage attack, we need to go to Debbie Morrow.
[00:34:18.839 --> 00:34:25.283]  And, folks, this morning, again, I ordered another filter
[00:34:26.335 --> 00:34:30.878]  Uh, for friends, I mean, I've ordered what?
[00:34:31.478 --> 00:34:32.378]  This isn't a joke.
[00:34:32.459 --> 00:34:35.180]  I've ordered five filters this year.
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:35.940]  Big ones.
[00:34:37.121 --> 00:34:40.263]  Because I've got friends and family that just will not do the right thing.
[00:34:41.733 --> 00:34:43.775]  And plus, I get an even better discount than you do.
[00:34:44.195 --> 00:34:47.578]  By the way, you're already getting the best discount out there when you say, Alex Jones sent you.
[00:34:47.638 --> 00:34:53.783]  I even get a little bit more than one where they don't even make anything, but they're great folks.
[00:34:54.363 --> 00:34:58.206]  So I just constantly am buying them myself to give them to people.
[00:34:58.246 --> 00:35:03.290]  But forget doing it because of a hurricane.
[00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:06.913]  The current crisis is the poisons in the water supply.
[00:35:06.933 --> 00:35:08.294]  Go to the EPA's own website.
[00:35:08.334 --> 00:35:10.676]  I mean, what they allow in there is incredible.
[00:35:11.403 --> 00:35:13.745]  But yes, this hurricane could ravage.
[00:35:13.805 --> 00:35:15.126]  It is now a Category 4.
[00:35:16.627 --> 00:35:19.049]  Rampaging towards Houston and Galveston.
[00:35:20.009 --> 00:35:23.212]  And it may turn and hit South Texas or Northern Mexico.
[00:35:23.952 --> 00:35:26.534]  And we pray for everybody that's going to be under its attack.
[00:35:27.695 --> 00:35:38.623]  But now, their phones are literally, literally, and there's only a few people there answering the phones, American company folks, made in America, highest quality, melting off the wall.
[00:35:39.648 --> 00:35:46.951]  But they're doing a deal where they're doing super fast shipping so you'll get it on I guess tomorrow night or Friday morning.
[00:35:46.991 --> 00:35:47.951]  I don't know.
[00:35:47.991 --> 00:35:49.272]  Let's talk to the person that knows.
[00:35:50.672 --> 00:35:52.033]  But you know I like to run on with the mouth.
[00:35:52.693 --> 00:35:57.155]  Debbie, what's this super deal you guys are offering people for no additional charge?
[00:35:57.855 --> 00:35:59.295]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me.
[00:35:59.315 --> 00:36:05.758]  Well, what we're doing is we've added an extra staff into our locations
[00:36:06.755 --> 00:36:10.639]  So they can pick up the messages and call the people back and take the orders.
[00:36:11.519 --> 00:36:15.583]  And then I'm getting the shipping instructions out for this afternoon.
[00:36:15.603 --> 00:36:20.247]  UPS picks up around 2.30 Mountain Time.
[00:36:21.388 --> 00:36:26.253]  If we can get the orders processed and everything, we'll send them out Blue Label, which is second day.
[00:36:26.273 --> 00:36:27.234]  Now that's 3.30 Central.
[00:36:30.122 --> 00:36:35.589]  So, folks, now, Debbie, did they get my message from two hours ago from my new order?
[00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:37.111]  I have no idea.
[00:36:37.131 --> 00:36:40.055]  It was left on the 0717 line.
[00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:43.099]  Yeah, and the first name of where it's going is Tommy.
[00:36:45.101 --> 00:36:48.243]  Yeah, I'll talk to them and find out to be sure.
[00:36:48.263 --> 00:36:53.486]  If you could fax the note over to Shirley or something, I'll call her and get the information.
[00:36:53.506 --> 00:36:56.687]  Well, I've already left it, so I'm sure one of your people got it.
[00:36:56.768 --> 00:36:56.968]  Okay.
[00:36:57.008 --> 00:37:00.269]  Tell people about the different specials you're offering and the special you're offering on shipping.
[00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:10.355]  Well, what we're doing on the shipping is we're offering to go ahead, and we normally charge $18 shipping and handling, and that'll get it regular ground.
[00:37:11.361 --> 00:37:16.783]  What we're doing is we're doing the same $18 but sending it out blue-labeled today to get there on Friday.
[00:37:16.903 --> 00:37:18.083]  And that cost you what, $50?
[00:37:19.264 --> 00:37:19.864]  It's a lot.
[00:37:20.164 --> 00:37:20.564]  I don't know.
[00:37:20.624 --> 00:37:21.985]  It depends on where it goes.
[00:37:22.065 --> 00:37:23.845]  The last time I did that I saw it on the bill.
[00:37:23.885 --> 00:37:25.066]  It's expensive to do that.
[00:37:25.106 --> 00:37:25.326]  It's $48 to $55.
[00:37:25.366 --> 00:37:25.906]  Folks, that's for $18.
[00:37:25.946 --> 00:37:27.067]  You get basically $50 shipping on average.
[00:37:35.482 --> 00:37:36.743]  Here in the country.
[00:37:37.083 --> 00:37:42.186]  And that's the regular discount on the stainless steel American Berkey with the two black elements?
[00:37:42.206 --> 00:37:43.126]  Right.
[00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:43.486]  A $2.25?
[00:37:43.847 --> 00:37:50.270]  Well, we'd like it to be because we are backordered on the big Berkeys for $2.35.
[00:37:50.570 --> 00:37:54.832]  What we want to do is we have the Royal Berkeys in stock for $2.60.
[00:37:55.312 --> 00:38:02.396]  And I like the Royal Berkey better anyway because it holds three and a half gallons as opposed to two and a half gallons.
[00:38:03.536 --> 00:38:07.297]  I think that the Royal Burkey is more family.
[00:38:07.657 --> 00:38:12.039]  I think it's a great size and it's embossed, it's engraved, it's really a nice product.
[00:38:12.059 --> 00:38:14.580]  So Debbie, right now you're out of the smaller ones?
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:21.422]  We're out of, well, Big Burkeys from, you know, the regular Big Burkey that everybody's familiar with.
[00:38:22.062 --> 00:38:26.343]  We're pretty much back-ordered on them now because of all the hurricanes and everything.
[00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.264]  So the Royal Burkeys
[00:38:28.985 --> 00:38:31.187]  Are what we're making available.
[00:38:31.507 --> 00:38:33.688]  What about the Lexan see-through models?
[00:38:33.969 --> 00:38:38.632]  We have them without lights available, but all the ones with lights are gone.
[00:38:38.652 --> 00:38:41.094]  I think I have two more left and they're shipping out.
[00:38:41.434 --> 00:38:43.435]  So right now you're basically selling out.
[00:38:43.956 --> 00:38:45.637]  We are, but everything's coming in.
[00:38:45.697 --> 00:38:47.338]  Like we have shipments coming in today.
[00:38:47.378 --> 00:38:49.660]  We have things being overnighted from England.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:54.663]  We have things being overnighted, you know, the American made things from across the country here.
[00:38:56.502 --> 00:39:05.145]  Yeah, don't stop calling because you go, oh, they don't have anything because we're having product overnighted and assembled and we've added quite a bit of staff.
[00:39:05.745 --> 00:39:06.325]  Okay, good.
[00:39:07.185 --> 00:39:08.306]  Debbie, I appreciate you coming on.
[00:39:08.326 --> 00:39:09.166]  I'm going to give the number out.
[00:39:09.426 --> 00:39:09.646]  Okay.
[00:39:09.886 --> 00:39:11.127]  Thanks for coming on and God bless.
[00:39:11.827 --> 00:39:15.508]  Folks, tell them Alex Jones sent you and you get huge discounts.
[00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:18.089]  Very important you do that.
[00:39:18.109 --> 00:39:21.430]  You also do get a free gift, a sports bottle, which will do 600 refills.
[00:39:23.337 --> 00:39:26.058]  And don't take the worst water you can imagine and purify it.
[00:39:26.258 --> 00:39:28.840]  And those are only like $25 for listeners.
[00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:32.082]  Be sure and take advantage of that as well.
[00:39:32.102 --> 00:39:32.162]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:32.182 --> 00:39:32.442]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:39:32.462 --> 00:39:37.505]  Look, don't procrastinate, but I'm telling you, the hurricane isn't even the crisis.
[00:39:37.665 --> 00:39:39.727]  It's bad, but it's what's already in the water.
[00:39:39.747 --> 00:39:39.787]  888-803-4438.
[00:39:52.483 --> 00:39:54.104]  888-803-4438.
[00:39:55.705 --> 00:39:57.927]  Alright, I really appreciate Debbie coming on with us.
[00:39:58.508 --> 00:39:59.448]  Until she's tired.
[00:39:59.809 --> 00:40:03.071]  I was talking to her this morning and the phone was just click, click, click.
[00:40:03.131 --> 00:40:03.932]  You know, people calling.
[00:40:04.412 --> 00:40:05.933]  I could hear folks in the background taking calls.
[00:40:06.294 --> 00:40:08.295]  But the American Berkies are made right here in America.
[00:40:08.335 --> 00:40:09.216]  That's the units I buy.
[00:40:09.236 --> 00:40:10.437]  They also have the British Berkies.
[00:40:11.522 --> 00:40:12.863]  The sports bottles are great too.
[00:40:12.883 --> 00:40:13.824]  They're made in America.
[00:40:13.924 --> 00:40:16.005]  They don't cut all the toxins out.
[00:40:16.525 --> 00:40:17.406]  They just reduce them.
[00:40:17.666 --> 00:40:20.428]  But they do cut all the bacteria and pathogenic stuff out.
[00:40:20.908 --> 00:40:22.089]  And they do 600 refills.
[00:40:22.109 --> 00:40:23.430]  So they make the water safe.
[00:40:24.330 --> 00:40:26.011]  And that's what I think is really good for hurricanes.
[00:40:27.072 --> 00:40:28.973]  But also the big burkeys are wonderful as well.
[00:40:28.993 --> 00:40:30.754]  Alright, I'm going to shut up about that.
[00:40:32.295 --> 00:40:34.157]  But it is important.
[00:40:34.177 --> 00:40:36.958]  What we're about to cover is really important.
[00:40:37.018 --> 00:40:40.741]  And that is the open assault on the First Amendment on free speech.
[00:40:41.696 --> 00:40:46.939]  And if you go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, we have links to these articles.
[00:40:47.099 --> 00:40:49.661]  House approves anti-hate bill and U.S.
[00:40:49.681 --> 00:40:51.802]  State Department says New Testament is anti-Semitic.
[00:40:52.302 --> 00:40:59.726]  And we have a direct link to the ADL's website where they openly admit they're advising the State Department, the Congress, to go ahead and get rid of the First Amendment.
[00:41:00.787 --> 00:41:02.668]  And this is just outrageous.
[00:41:02.708 --> 00:41:07.331]  And then we've also caught rabbis and others connected to these groups
[00:41:08.474 --> 00:41:23.464]  Uh, going out and having people dress up as Klan members and white supremacists when a bill isn't going to pass, say, in Idaho in a famous case, and then the mailing address for the white supremacist group, the degenerate distasteful group, we don't like them either, folks.
[00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:24.325]  We don't like scum.
[00:41:25.165 --> 00:41:27.767]  Uh, it goes back to the rabbi.
[00:41:28.783 --> 00:41:32.307]  And we've caught a bunch of different Jewish groups and black groups as well.
[00:41:32.687 --> 00:41:34.128]  You smell all of the news, you've heard about it.
[00:41:34.549 --> 00:41:40.595]  Mailing themselves hate letters, stealing their own newspapers, spray painting swastikas on their own synagogues.
[00:41:41.035 --> 00:41:45.139]  In fact, more often than not, that's what's happening.
[00:41:45.419 --> 00:41:46.520]  I'm really tired of it.
[00:41:46.580 --> 00:41:48.342]  Again, it's a problem-reaction solution.
[00:41:49.083 --> 00:41:51.765]  Now, there's laws against spray painting a swastika on a synagogue.
[00:41:52.746 --> 00:41:53.467]  And I think it's horrible.
[00:41:54.409 --> 00:42:03.357]  Because, you know, most Jewish folks are wonderful people, and that just makes them then think everybody's out to get them, and then gets them under the control of the radical right-wing Zionists who want to control them.
[00:42:05.278 --> 00:42:09.061]  And then, at the same time, we see just... You know what?
[00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:10.623]  There's so many examples of this.
[00:42:11.904 --> 00:42:22.593]  We had George Galloway, a member of Parliament, talking about the big BBC reports and reports out of even the Harots in Jerusalem Post.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:29.224]  Where they create fake Al-Qaeda groups, Mossad does, to bomb Jews to then get police state control there.
[00:42:30.024 --> 00:42:40.451]  Or how they wanted to run Jews out of Europe so the Zionists would bomb Jewish synagogues in Spain and in Iraq to run the Jews out.
[00:42:40.471 --> 00:42:43.113]  Well, I mean, they admit now that Kermit Roosevelt and the CIA
[00:42:43.971 --> 00:42:49.693]  bombed mosque and blamed it on Mosaddegh to kick Mosaddegh out in 1953 in Iran.
[00:42:49.713 --> 00:42:50.753]  So it's just the same thing.
[00:42:51.193 --> 00:42:54.454]  They want us all in each other's throats so they can then ban our free speech.
[00:42:55.014 --> 00:43:03.296]  And they're banning Christians praying on street corners and arresting them and they're facing hardcore prison time for kneeling and praying.
[00:43:03.336 --> 00:43:04.277]  This is not a joke, folks.
[00:43:04.537 --> 00:43:06.717]  This is Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:43:06.737 --> 00:43:07.837]  This is AP.
[00:43:08.358 --> 00:43:09.518]  This is mainstream news.
[00:43:11.411 --> 00:43:22.819]  You'll have 500 Bush supporters, one person has a sign saying, Bush is a war profiteer, the police march up, and they say, you're not allowed to protest, and they give them, you know, six months in federal prison.
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:26.261]  I mean, folks, everybody's losing their free speech.
[00:43:27.362 --> 00:43:28.363]  And this is a nightmare.
[00:43:28.383 --> 00:43:30.565]  So, Pastor Pike joins us.
[00:43:31.465 --> 00:43:32.806]  Pastor Pike, thanks for coming on.
[00:43:32.826 --> 00:43:34.588]  Thanks for having me, Alex.
[00:43:34.968 --> 00:43:39.251]  Well, I appreciate you holding during my diatribe on water filters, and then... Well, it's been very interesting.
[00:43:41.049 --> 00:43:52.362]  Give us kind of a background on what the ADL really is, not a Jewish organization folks, and then let's go through basically just how
[00:43:53.368 --> 00:44:13.060]  Just how 11th hour things are, because I mentioned to you during the last break, every time I mention Christians facing 47 years and it going to trial for kneeling and praying, and this is on video folks, on your website Pastor Pike, this was on National News as well, every time I talk about it I get calls going, where is that?
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:13.941]  I don't believe that.
[00:44:14.421 --> 00:44:15.422]  So please fill us in.
[00:44:16.142 --> 00:44:19.164]  Yes, well the Anti-Defamation League was formed in 1913,
[00:44:20.965 --> 00:44:21.626]  We're good to go!
[00:44:39.162 --> 00:44:44.766]  It has 2,100 lodges and chapters worldwide in more than 50 countries.
[00:44:45.127 --> 00:44:46.408]  It's basically Amasya.
[00:44:47.168 --> 00:44:57.856]  That's right, but we have to be really honest about that, and let's just talk for a second about B'nai B'rith, because the Anti-Defamation League is part of B'nai B'rith.
[00:44:57.896 --> 00:45:01.919]  They've had their squabbles over the decades, but it is still part of B'nai B'rith.
[00:45:02.399 --> 00:45:04.481]  At the B'nai B'rith website,
[00:45:05.569 --> 00:45:16.398]  Their first description of themselves says, We, B'nai B'rith, are the on-ground members and supporters in more than 50 countries.
[00:45:16.818 --> 00:45:21.242]  We are, in a real sense, the body and soul of the Jewish world.
[00:45:21.702 --> 00:45:23.944]  From Argentina to Slovakia, etc.
[00:45:24.304 --> 00:45:28.808]  B'nai B'rith, it says, is a synonym for organized Jewry.
[00:45:29.088 --> 00:45:29.789]  And right now,
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:35.863]  B'nai B'rith is establishing a huge European hate crimes gestapo.
[00:45:35.883 --> 00:45:45.548]  They have 55 nations now who have joined together in an organization, the OSCE, the Organization for Security and Cooperation.
[00:45:45.568 --> 00:45:53.753]  And they're now, they're the guys lobbying to shut down our internet here, and our government's saying Germany can come arrest American citizens for what we say here.
[00:45:54.073 --> 00:45:59.436]  And for those that think, oh this is just people with swastikas on their arms, who Pastor Pike and I resist and don't like,
[00:46:00.123 --> 00:46:09.048]  Understand folks, we had Robin Page, BBC 20 plus year reporter of One Man and His Dog, a rural affairs show.
[00:46:09.608 --> 00:46:17.492]  All he said in his speech was, rural communities deserve the same rights as Muslims and homosexuals.
[00:46:17.773 --> 00:46:23.796]  Scotland Yard arrested him under these hate crimes codified codes.
[00:46:24.623 --> 00:46:29.024]  And took him into custody saying the word homosexual was hate.
[00:46:29.504 --> 00:46:34.285]  So this is the type of just reign of terror we're talking about.
[00:46:34.345 --> 00:46:42.307]  Yeah, and this is getting established in Europe with no less than 55 nations buying into these twisted definitions of hate.
[00:46:43.047 --> 00:46:45.688]  And of course the working definition of hate
[00:46:46.267 --> 00:46:46.868]  I think?
[00:47:06.227 --> 00:47:19.423]  uh... hate criminal and the bible becomes a hate literature in countries which are under the dominion of these ADL benign hate laws and you're right, their top priority under the OSCE in Europe right now is
[00:47:21.241 --> 00:47:46.287]  is a creation of an organization which combines the greatest expertise of internet technology, legal issues and so on to shut down what they call cyber hate on the internet and of course you're at the top of the list as a cyber hate, a hater, any free speech talk show, radio host who utilizes the internet worldwide is a prime target now
[00:47:47.562 --> 00:47:50.084]  For those that don't know, we are inches away from being shut down.
[00:47:50.104 --> 00:47:51.684]  I want listeners to know this.
[00:47:52.065 --> 00:47:53.085]  This is a top priority.
[00:47:53.105 --> 00:47:54.866]  The ADL is squirming and anxious.
[00:48:09.694 --> 00:48:17.399]  Because there's so many loose cannons out there on the internet, spilling the beans like you and I are about this conspiracy.
[00:48:17.699 --> 00:48:32.129]  They also have a huge statistics gathering organization, which takes information about so-called hate crimes from all of these 55 nations now, which are now a member of OSCE, and of course they have a twisted definition that makes it
[00:48:32.809 --> 00:48:38.891]  You know, hollering across the street or shouting verbal epithets between skinheads and gays or whatever.
[00:48:38.911 --> 00:48:40.131]  That becomes a hate crime.
[00:48:40.411 --> 00:48:45.333]  They put that in there, Hopper, and they produce these tremendously high... Let me give people an example.
[00:48:45.353 --> 00:48:46.413]  Let me give people an example.
[00:48:46.933 --> 00:48:53.155]  I was out there with black folks, Hispanics, you name it, protesting racist Hispanic groups Saturday.
[00:48:53.655 --> 00:48:54.976]  And I was assaulted.
[00:48:55.016 --> 00:48:58.577]  I had a woman run up and grab both my biceps and squeeze her fingernails into me.
[00:48:59.306 --> 00:49:02.889]  The state police, who are even like us, are so afraid of them, they did nothing.
[00:49:03.189 --> 00:49:04.170]  It's all on video.
[00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:05.471]  They did push her off.
[00:49:05.931 --> 00:49:10.894]  Then another individual came with his cane and rammed at Mike Henson, holding my camera.
[00:49:10.934 --> 00:49:12.075]  It's all on video.
[00:49:12.436 --> 00:49:15.538]  He was wearing a shirt saying, Oslon, for all of the Americas.
[00:49:16.058 --> 00:49:23.924]  In the future, folks, if I yell on a bullhorn, and that's considered to be hateful, I will disappear into a gulag and never be seen again.
[00:49:24.384 --> 00:49:29.589]  Well, you see right there the double standard which our justice and police system have.
[00:49:30.049 --> 00:49:33.972]  I presume these may have been Hispanic people who are assaulting you.
[00:49:34.132 --> 00:49:34.352]  Yes.
[00:49:34.453 --> 00:49:40.858]  If you had jammed your biceps, your fingers into her biceps, she would, and if you had used some kind of a
[00:49:41.338 --> 00:49:50.366]  A racist slur, that would have been a violation of the... Yeah, they were calling us gringo devils and... Yeah, right, okay.
[00:49:50.447 --> 00:49:52.328]  But that's okay!
[00:49:52.388 --> 00:50:00.516]  The minorities, the federally protected groups, such as Jews, homosexuals, Chicanos, blacks, and so on, are never, I repeat, are never
[00:50:00.916 --> 00:50:06.420]  Well, by the way, I'm the minority in Texas and five other states.
[00:50:06.520 --> 00:50:27.954]  Yes, well anyway, the most outstanding, outrageous example of bias crime being charged against Christians was of course in Philadelphia last October 10th when 11 Christians were doing nothing more than preaching and witnessing in the public square in Philadelphia
[00:50:28.739 --> 00:50:42.731]  Lynn Abraham, who is the National Executive Board Member of the ADL, and also the DA of Philadelphia, she gave orders to arrest those Christians under the authority of the ADL Pennsylvania Hate Law.
[00:50:42.751 --> 00:50:43.091]  Stay there!
[00:50:43.151 --> 00:50:44.072]  Stay there!
[00:50:44.292 --> 00:50:44.652]  Stay there!
[00:50:44.672 --> 00:50:46.294]  Give us...repeat that when we get back.
[00:50:46.574 --> 00:50:54.040]  We'll talk about the Dark Lords of the ADL giving their orders to their henchmen to execute the First Amendment when we return.
[00:50:54.681 --> 00:50:57.243]  I just can't wait to start savaging Christians.
[00:51:02.703 --> 00:51:05.564]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.805 --> 00:51:07.386]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.726 --> 00:51:12.409]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.749 --> 00:51:19.473]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:19.793 --> 00:51:21.774]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:21.994 --> 00:51:24.835]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.915 --> 00:51:29.597]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.798 --> 00:51:34.180]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:41.663]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:53:39.215 --> 00:53:42.016]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:12.955 --> 00:54:14.575]  We're talking to Pastor Ted Pike.
[00:54:17.056 --> 00:54:19.896]  And this is not a joke, this is not a drill.
[00:54:20.916 --> 00:54:22.597]  And I know a lot of you are still in denial.
[00:54:23.377 --> 00:54:29.438]  So one of the most famous cases that finally got America to wake up, happened in the last year.
[00:54:30.398 --> 00:54:31.578]  And they were going to trial.
[00:54:31.598 --> 00:54:33.819]  They were facing 47 years in prison.
[00:54:34.299 --> 00:54:36.159]  And thank God they had video of all of it.
[00:54:36.199 --> 00:54:41.120]  And Bush's Justice Department advised, and just like Bush's Justice Department went after Judge Roy Moore,
[00:54:42.845 --> 00:54:45.586]  And they promoted the Attorney General that savaged him?
[00:54:46.666 --> 00:54:47.947]  I mean, just another example.
[00:54:48.367 --> 00:54:51.248]  The first thing Bush did was raid the Indianapolis Baptist Temple.
[00:54:52.028 --> 00:54:54.829]  I mean, these are evil, evil people, folks.
[00:54:55.669 --> 00:55:00.631]  But Pastor Pike, please continue with what happened to these good, decent Christian preachers.
[00:55:01.371 --> 00:55:10.594]  Yes, they were charged with eight crimes, including three felonies and violation of the Anti-Deflammation State Anti-Hate Law.
[00:55:11.301 --> 00:55:20.771]  And in court, the prosecution for the city of Philadelphia claimed that these Christians were guilty of hate speech.
[00:55:20.811 --> 00:55:32.644]  They had used their bullhorn as an instrument of crime, conveying hateful verses out of the Bible against these sodomites, provoking a riot among the homosexuals.
[00:55:33.084 --> 00:55:49.176]  That combined with a clear bias against homosexuality seemed to entitle Lynn Abraham and the Hate Crimes Gestapo of Philadelphia to lock them up for 21 hours in jail and launch prosecution against them.
[00:55:49.557 --> 00:55:55.942]  Fortunately, I had been in contact with Michael Markovich, the leader of the Philly 11.
[00:55:56.302 --> 00:55:59.024]  We were able to dramatize that on many talk show hosts.
[00:55:59.733 --> 00:56:01.876]  Now let's understand why they were being charged.
[00:56:01.896 --> 00:56:02.196]  What they did.
[00:56:19.598 --> 00:56:24.322]  Against homosexuality basically means that you are a hater.
[00:56:24.762 --> 00:56:39.294]  And if they can contrive some kind of a crime, small or great, which is a result of that bias, then according to the American definition of a hate crime in state hate laws, you have become guilty of a hate crime.
[00:56:39.334 --> 00:56:43.878]  Now in Canada it's different, because up there they don't have the protections of the First Amendment.
[00:56:44.238 --> 00:56:47.861]  Up in Canada, if a member of a federally protected group
[00:56:48.314 --> 00:56:52.216]  You can simply claim that their feelings have been hurt by your speech.
[00:56:52.657 --> 00:57:01.202]  They can report you to the Hate Crimes Tribunal, and you may end up spending a couple hundred thousand dollars, if you're lucky, to keep from going to prison.
[00:57:01.997 --> 00:57:03.658]  Or going to prison, as many have.
[00:57:03.778 --> 00:57:05.479]  And I mean, this is mild stuff, too, folks.
[00:57:05.499 --> 00:57:09.982]  But we're talking about the First Amendment here, and it's being viciously savage.
[00:57:10.062 --> 00:57:16.426]  But they had videotaped, though, that all they did was pray on a street corner and do what the police said when they said move.
[00:57:17.327 --> 00:57:19.588]  And tell folks how long they were facing in prison.
[00:57:19.908 --> 00:57:22.950]  They were facing a total of 47 years in prison and $80,000 in fines each.
[00:57:23.030 --> 00:57:26.752]  And that included a 17-year-old girl who was in prison as part of this group.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:35.861]  Now again, folks, we're talking about praying because it upset the other groups.
[00:57:36.681 --> 00:57:37.762]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:57:37.962 --> 00:57:51.945]  And if you want to just kind of fast-track forward to where we will be in a few years if this big federal hate bill, which has now been approved by the House of Representatives, becomes law, I got a call a few months back from a pastor in Canada
[00:57:52.412 --> 00:58:00.522]  And he had just that week been out in the public square in a town in northern Saskatchewan doing nothing but handing out pamphlets.
[00:58:00.562 --> 00:58:05.007]  I don't think he was even verbally involved with the people handing out gospel tracts.
[00:58:05.508 --> 00:58:07.871]  And a policeman walked up to him and informed him
[00:58:08.371 --> 00:58:16.254]  That such so-called proselytizing is now a hate crime in Canada, and if he were to continue, he would have to be arrested.
[00:58:16.274 --> 00:58:29.798]  Now that's the bottom line where all of this legislation is heading is to end the free speech of Christians, even the free speech to evangelize and perform the basic duties of a true Christian.
[00:58:30.218 --> 00:58:31.099]  Stay there, Pastor.
[00:58:31.359 --> 00:58:35.140]  Folks, this is not a joke, this is not a game, this is not a drill.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.661]  Look at all the other horrible stuff that's happening.
[00:58:37.701 --> 00:58:38.562]  This is going on.
[00:58:38.782 --> 00:58:40.043]  We'll give you details when we get back.
[00:58:41.203 --> 00:58:46.086]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.663 --> 00:59:01.847]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:59:02.507 --> 00:59:03.308]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.068 --> 00:59:05.029]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.650 --> 00:59:09.293]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.813 --> 00:59:13.936]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.056 --> 00:59:19.241]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:19.301 --> 00:59:21.442]  Now into our number two.
[00:59:21.482 --> 00:59:23.244]  We're going to have open phones today.
[00:59:24.677 --> 00:59:37.287]  Coming up, just a mini guest, just to give you some info, the head of the National Organic Association, about how the federal government is going to let all these companies certify stuff as organic that isn't organic?
[00:59:38.167 --> 00:59:40.149]  You thought you'd escape their poison?
[00:59:40.249 --> 00:59:40.669]  Oh no!
[00:59:41.850 --> 00:59:47.815]  Oh no, maybe it's hateful to talk bad about stuff that isn't genetically modified.
[00:59:48.505 --> 00:59:50.346]  By the way, I'm not joking about that.
[00:59:50.826 --> 00:59:57.587]  They've actually arrested farmers in England, in one case, who called French strawberries garbage.
[00:59:58.208 --> 01:00:02.049]  And that was considered to be xenophobic because it was a reflection on the French people.
[01:00:03.849 --> 01:00:06.950]  No, they were just saying, our products are better, your strawberries are garbage.
[01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:10.551]  And said that in a radio interview, so he got arrested.
[01:00:11.368 --> 01:00:13.929]  That's what we're talking about with Pastor Ted Pike.
[01:00:13.969 --> 01:00:18.711]  I mean, this is thought control, mind control, you know, free speech zones, all of this.
[01:00:18.771 --> 01:00:19.292]  It's happening.
[01:00:19.772 --> 01:00:27.375]  And the left is for the right losing their free speech, and the right is for the left losing their free speech, and then the false left paradigm, we all lose our free speech.
[01:00:28.816 --> 01:00:36.639]  But the vanguard of leading this is the ADL, the Antichrist Devil League.
[01:00:37.379 --> 01:00:40.221]  And the Antichrist Devil League is
[01:00:41.514 --> 01:00:47.218]  Running around, openly getting Christians arrested for praying on the street corner, and we just covered that in the last hour.
[01:00:47.258 --> 01:00:48.459]  These are real cases.
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:52.322]  And the Antichrist Devil League advises local police departments.
[01:00:52.762 --> 01:00:53.943]  They write the handbooks.
[01:00:55.384 --> 01:00:59.386]  This is where you get, you know, FEMA training in Road to Tyranny, where they're saying all Christians are terrorists.
[01:00:59.727 --> 01:01:01.088]  We have FEMA on tape saying this.
[01:01:01.428 --> 01:01:04.410]  The Antichrist Devil League taught them this.
[01:01:05.447 --> 01:01:11.134]  And we're talking to Pastor Pike about what the Antichrist Devil League is up to right now.
[01:01:11.154 --> 01:01:12.656]  And there's other horrible groups.
[01:01:12.676 --> 01:01:15.019]  The Southern Perversion Law Center.
[01:01:15.735 --> 01:01:19.656]  And other groups that are doing this, but the leaders are the Antichrist Devil League.
[01:01:19.696 --> 01:01:35.079]  Pastor Pike, I want to go over some more cases of this, and some stations don't carry this segment, so I want to get into the new legislation that's passed the House, and how to stop this in the next segment, but give us some more examples in the next few minutes of how the Antichrist Devil League is lobbying.
[01:01:35.739 --> 01:01:44.501]  Yes, the President last October signed into law, with the approval of Congress, the unanimous approval I believe,
[01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:56.010]  The Global Department of Antisemitism, which is now being set up in the State Department, and it is mandated to produce an annual report which is ghostwritten by A.D.L.
[01:01:56.030 --> 01:01:57.011]  B'nai B'rith.
[01:01:57.512 --> 01:02:02.218]  And in this 40-page report, which you can get from the State Department website,
[01:02:03.176 --> 01:02:18.841]  They have about 14 twisted definitions there throughout the entirety of the 40-page report, gleaned from so-called anti-Semitic actions throughout these 55 nations over which B'nai B'rith International presides.
[01:02:18.921 --> 01:02:23.463]  By the way, criticizing the IMF or World Bank is supposedly code for anti-Semitism.
[01:02:23.743 --> 01:02:24.603]  Everything's code!
[01:02:24.683 --> 01:02:25.403]  Everything's code!
[01:02:25.584 --> 01:02:28.705]  Right, well, yeah, it's a horrendous list.
[01:02:30.985 --> 01:02:32.946]  We could go through it, but we don't have time.
[01:02:33.006 --> 01:02:34.707]  Yeah, we have time if you want to go through it.
[01:02:34.767 --> 01:02:35.247]  Oh, do you?
[01:02:35.367 --> 01:02:35.848]  Okay.
[01:02:37.748 --> 01:02:40.830]  Yeah, let's see here.
[01:02:41.770 --> 01:02:44.391]  Well, I'll tell you what, I'll just look here while I talk.
[01:02:44.411 --> 01:02:45.152]  Sure.
[01:02:45.272 --> 01:02:54.416]  Anyway, this hate crimes Gestapo basically makes evangelical Christians by the millions into anti-Semites because
[01:02:55.313 --> 01:02:59.935]  It cites an example of a pastor in Poland, and I'll quote right here.
[01:03:00.395 --> 01:03:02.676]  It says, quote, the pastor of the St.
[01:03:02.716 --> 01:03:09.879]  Bridget Church in Gdansk told parishioners during services that Jews killed Jesus and the prophets.
[01:03:10.279 --> 01:03:15.101]  It says that's an outstanding example of anti-Semitism this spring in Poland.
[01:03:15.361 --> 01:03:21.083]  Well, if we think about that, isn't that exactly what Mel Gibson said in The Passion of the Christ?
[01:03:21.604 --> 01:03:27.947]  He basically said that these evil Jewish leaders, whipping up the Jewish mob, called for the crucifixion of Christ.
[01:03:28.408 --> 01:03:31.129]  So if you agree with that, you are now anti-Semitic.
[01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:42.575]  And this is actually going to create more anti-Semitism, which is actually what these groups like, to then put pressure on the general Jews, who aren't doing anything bad, to then be under their control.
[01:03:42.615 --> 01:03:44.796]  We'll talk about that, too, when we get back.
[01:03:45.537 --> 01:03:49.539]  This is the politics, or the strategy of tension.
[01:03:49.939 --> 01:03:50.600]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:51.220]  We'll tell you about it.
[01:03:53.268 --> 01:03:54.789]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:54.969 --> 01:03:58.050]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.190 --> 01:04:02.091]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:06.353]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:04:06.713 --> 01:04:10.474]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.574 --> 01:04:12.295]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:15.916]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:04:15.976 --> 01:04:20.678]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:20.838 --> 01:04:23.879]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:04:24.059 --> 01:04:26.920]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.421 --> 01:04:33.523]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.063 --> 01:04:37.848]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[01:07:08.208 --> 01:07:09.088]  Alex Jones, your host.
[01:07:09.628 --> 01:07:14.569]  And to be clear, so I'm not confused with all the other Alex Joneses, I still get emails every day.
[01:07:14.609 --> 01:07:15.249]  Am I this guy?
[01:07:15.269 --> 01:07:15.909]  Am I that guy?
[01:07:16.409 --> 01:07:19.590]  I'm not Alex S. Jones of the New York Times.
[01:07:19.650 --> 01:07:23.751]  I'm not Alex E. Jones, the industrialist from Canada.
[01:07:23.871 --> 01:07:28.652]  I'm Alexander Emerick Jones from Austin, Texas.
[01:07:28.732 --> 01:07:30.192]  I've got to do that every few weeks.
[01:07:30.976 --> 01:07:34.899]  There's so many Alex Joneses out there, it's a pretty common name, and I get these emails.
[01:07:34.939 --> 01:07:36.540]  You're a New York Times writer!
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:45.066]  So I had to just, I want to throw that out today because I got two emails in the last couple days about this, and it just, I guess it's something I'll always have to announce.
[01:07:45.206 --> 01:07:47.288]  I'm Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[01:07:48.649 --> 01:07:50.570]  There's different Alex Joneses.
[01:07:51.110 --> 01:07:51.891]  It's pretty annoying.
[01:07:52.211 --> 01:07:58.816]  Why, you're the, you're the head public relations person for Scientology, a 56-year-old guy with black hair.
[01:07:59.717 --> 01:08:00.658]  No, I'm not!
[01:08:02.298 --> 01:08:04.159]  It's like Alex A. Jones or something.
[01:08:04.279 --> 01:08:09.702]  I'm Alexander M. Morick, as in middle name German.
[01:08:10.522 --> 01:08:12.983]  Alexander M. Morick Jones.
[01:08:13.003 --> 01:08:17.865]  Alright, it's obnoxious to have to do that, but I've got to do that every once in a while.
[01:08:18.086 --> 01:08:23.068]  We're talking to Pastor Ted Pike, and Pastor Pike
[01:08:24.345 --> 01:08:25.466]  I've heard him many times on the radio.
[01:08:25.486 --> 01:08:26.826]  We've interviewed him many times over the years.
[01:08:26.846 --> 01:08:29.388]  He makes sure to tell you that he loves the Jewish people.
[01:08:29.868 --> 01:08:32.529]  And the Bible says they are the chosen people in God's plan.
[01:08:33.610 --> 01:08:38.492]  We're doing this because the ADL are the leaders of attacking free speech.
[01:08:38.552 --> 01:08:40.173]  And they're not a Jewish organization, folks.
[01:08:40.193 --> 01:08:41.793]  They are a mafioso organization.
[01:08:42.314 --> 01:08:48.577]  You know, I talked yesterday about how the Israeli government in the 50s radiated 100,000 Jewish children.
[01:08:48.617 --> 01:08:49.357]  Most of them died.
[01:08:50.706 --> 01:08:59.971]  They tell their parents they were going to have dental work done, or they were going from school to have, quote, be checked for ringworm fungus, and they would zap them with radiation, and most of them died on the table.
[01:09:00.832 --> 01:09:03.233]  Now, I know, and that's in the Jerusalem Post.
[01:09:03.974 --> 01:09:10.077]  And the same weirdo crowd that was zapping these Jewish children, if you talk about that, the ADL comes after you.
[01:09:10.908 --> 01:09:22.995]  If you talk about how the Zionists actually, it's public now, the liberals are talking about it, funded Hitler and supported Hitler because he would be mean to Jews and drive them out of Europe so the Zionists could basically have them as their domesticated slaves.
[01:09:23.636 --> 01:09:24.636]  It's the same thing, folks.
[01:09:24.656 --> 01:09:30.440]  You've got Germans enslaving Germans and English enslaving English and black tribe leaders enslaving black people.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:31.921]  It's the same thing.
[01:09:31.941 --> 01:09:35.503]  And then they tell their group, do what we say or this other group's going to get you.
[01:09:36.408 --> 01:09:42.872]  It's like the radical Oslon crowd, you know, if Hispanics don't follow all their orders, you know, they say horrible things about them.
[01:09:43.852 --> 01:09:45.273]  And so we've got to understand this.
[01:09:45.293 --> 01:09:47.034]  We're not here bashing Jews, folks.
[01:09:47.994 --> 01:09:59.160]  We're here exposing this horrible organization, sworn to get your guns, sworn to enslave you and your family, who slandered me over and over again, and I'm sick of it.
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:01.982]  I mean, they'll manufacture stuff I never even said and put it on their website.
[01:10:03.082 --> 01:10:04.923]  Pastor Pike, let's talk about the bill.
[01:10:05.244 --> 01:10:07.725]  We've beat this five times, but they keep coming back.
[01:10:08.105 --> 01:10:08.606]  That's right.
[01:10:08.666 --> 01:10:18.612]  The ADL has sworn that they're going to continue again and again to reintroduce this big federal hate bill regardless of whether it's defeated, they'll be back again the next year.
[01:10:18.652 --> 01:10:19.973]  And they've gotten deceptive.
[01:10:19.993 --> 01:10:21.634]  They've got a new name for it this time.
[01:10:22.236 --> 01:10:26.520]  Well, yeah, it's called the Local Law Enforcement Hate Crimes Prevention Act.
[01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.344]  And it should be called the Federalization of Local Police and Sheriff's Department Thought Crimes Division.
[01:10:31.584 --> 01:10:43.395]  Yeah, well, it could be called the Local Law Enforcement Invasion Act because basically what it does is it breaks down all barriers to federal intervention in states' rights to law enforcement.
[01:10:43.795 --> 01:10:52.897]  This has been the main barrier to establishing a huge federal anti-hate bureaucracy like exists in Canada, is that we still have some states' rights.
[01:10:53.797 --> 01:11:10.380]  We have requirements that unless the federal government can find a jury tampering or voter fraud or hate crimes involving interstate commerce or even slavery in the state, the federal government has got to stay out of local law enforcement.
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:21.103]  And so what this bill largely boils down to is an attempt to break down all divisions between law enforcement on the federal and the local level.
[01:11:21.881 --> 01:11:31.448]  And just this week, a caller told me that he heard Franks, Barney Franks, the homosexual representative from Massachusetts... Well, he's more than that.
[01:11:31.528 --> 01:11:33.530]  He has underage children in his house.
[01:11:33.750 --> 01:11:34.550]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:11:34.570 --> 01:11:35.991]  But he doesn't get in trouble for that.
[01:11:36.171 --> 01:11:40.855]  And yet, he was on C-SPAN before Congress, as this bill was being passed.
[01:11:41.355 --> 01:11:54.910]  arguing that with the very bad blood between blacks and whites coming out of the New Orleans disaster, it would be very very important now to adopt this federal anti-heat bill to keep a watch, keep a lid on... Bad blood?
[01:11:55.071 --> 01:11:57.814]  Texas took in the predominantly black people and we've been...
[01:11:58.665 --> 01:12:00.027]  Lavishing them with goods!
[01:12:00.728 --> 01:12:18.927]  Right, but according to him, the potential for hate and hate crimes is very great coming out of this disaster, and that was basically all it took to persuade these timid members of Congress to go ahead... What about a law to stop Barney Franks from having underage callboys in his house?
[01:12:19.127 --> 01:12:21.990]  Yeah, well, this bill is pro-homosexual.
[01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:27.336]  It's pro-homo, pro-pederasty, pro-transvestite, and so on.
[01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:36.567]  In fact, this latest version adds transvestites and women, female impersonators, for special federal protection that you and I don't have.
[01:12:36.587 --> 01:12:39.811]  And by the way, they're saying it'll be a hate crime if a woman gets upset.
[01:12:40.632 --> 01:12:46.237]  Uh, if one of these guys is in the bathroom, which we had just had a big case of that in Central Texas, it's freaking these women out.
[01:12:46.377 --> 01:12:46.638]  Yeah.
[01:12:46.998 --> 01:12:51.102]  I mean, and now they're evil because they're freaked out somebody's dressed like a woman in the bathroom.
[01:12:51.303 --> 01:12:55.507]  Yeah, but they have special federal protection under this bill now.
[01:12:55.887 --> 01:12:59.351]  In fact, that's unique to this latest version was giving special
[01:12:59.771 --> 01:13:11.275]  Special protection rights to FBI expertise in criminology, investigative powers, and so on, to those who are masquerading as women and going into women's bathrooms.
[01:13:11.955 --> 01:13:14.996]  And so you can see how perverse this legislation is.
[01:13:15.376 --> 01:13:30.141]  The ADL is literally a fountain of legislative sewage to this nation, and I am calling on Jews of good intention, like Rabbi Lappin out in Seattle, who says that the ADL is now
[01:13:30.601 --> 01:13:44.486]  In fact, let me just quickly read a statement by Rado Lapin in a recent interview.
[01:13:44.526 --> 01:13:51.748]  He says it's a real tragedy that an organization like the ADL, which was originally formed a hundred years ago or more,
[01:13:52.148 --> 01:14:00.694]  To fight defamation of Jews is now contributing, so sadly, to the very defamation it was formed to prevent.
[01:14:00.934 --> 01:14:03.936]  So they're stimulating anti-Semitism blood flow.
[01:14:03.956 --> 01:14:08.259]  But the same people that control it now have been caught red-handed doing this always.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:09.220]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.981]  They're utter hypocrites.
[01:14:11.202 --> 01:14:13.423]  Let's explain, though, the strategy of tension.
[01:14:13.483 --> 01:14:16.625]  They want anti-Semitism, folks, so don't give it to them.
[01:14:17.106 --> 01:14:18.207]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:14:18.347 --> 01:14:21.429]  And what we have to remember here is that for thousands of years,
[01:14:21.909 --> 01:14:31.480]  The Jewish people, since they rejected Jesus Christ as the only trustworthy guide they will ever have, instead they opted for following the Pharisees.
[01:14:31.821 --> 01:14:38.268]  And Jesus said the Pharisees turned upside down the laws of God and made it a none effect.
[01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:39.570]  And these wicked Pharisees
[01:14:40.230 --> 01:14:46.892]  Like the ADL, B'nai B'rith today have led the flock of Israel into twisted and wrong ways.
[01:14:47.352 --> 01:14:56.854]  And so, throughout the last 2,000 years, through the Babylonian Talmud, which was the product of the Pharisees, and the Zohar, the Kabbalah, all of that is Pharisaic.
[01:14:57.274 --> 01:14:59.534]  They have created racism in Judaism.
[01:14:59.554 --> 01:15:03.295]  They've created isolation and hatred and suspicion against Gentiles.
[01:15:03.875 --> 01:15:06.736]  And this is a very great tragedy, and that's why
[01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:17.902]  I'm calling for Jews of good intention, like Rabbi Lappin and others, to lead many, many, many good Jews, well-intentioned Jews.
[01:15:17.982 --> 01:15:19.823]  Kind of like a Moses?
[01:15:20.203 --> 01:15:27.687]  That's right, out of ADL bondage and so on, and fulfill the true mandate which God gave through the prophet Jeremiah.
[01:15:28.146 --> 01:15:36.288]  Thousands of years ago, that the Jewish people should, in the lands of their dispersion, they should live at peace and seek the welfare of those nations.
[01:15:36.328 --> 01:15:39.469]  Because in doing that, they themselves would have peace.
[01:15:39.529 --> 01:15:40.569]  But what A.D.L.
[01:15:40.589 --> 01:15:45.650]  B'nai B'rith are doing is they are whipping up all of these hate laws worldwide.
[01:15:45.690 --> 01:15:49.931]  And the Gentiles know that these Jewish leaders are behind these.
[01:15:49.951 --> 01:15:53.612]  There's tremendous anti-Semitism and bad blood working up.
[01:15:54.432 --> 01:16:08.937]  And what the ADL wants to do, of course, is to create fanaticism out of it, create anti-Semitic movements, which they, in turn, can propagandize when these movements erupt in violence against Jews.
[01:16:09.237 --> 01:16:19.001]  They can create their own mythologies, and basically teach the world more and more false lessons, such as they did out of the Holocaust in the Second World War.
[01:16:20.913 --> 01:16:33.019]  But you know, while anti-semitism is on the rise, at the same time, people figuring out the code of how this is all manipulated, people are finally seeing the illusion more than ever.
[01:16:33.320 --> 01:16:34.240]  Well, absolutely.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:35.661]  And the real challenge
[01:16:36.181 --> 01:16:37.341]  is to beat the A.D.L.
[01:16:37.361 --> 01:16:50.446]  Beriff people at their own game, and raise the levels of awareness of the true enemy that they are, without descending into racism or vulgar anti-Semitism.
[01:16:50.866 --> 01:17:01.009]  And of course I believe that the Holy Scriptures are the perfect antidote to that, they're the perfect prescription for moderation and balance, because I do believe firmly that God
[01:17:01.491 --> 01:17:19.126]  God invested a tremendous amount in the Jewish nation over thousands of years, and eventually the Holy Scriptures prophesy that someday out of great tribulation and reversal and anguish, a remnant of Jews will turn to Jesus as their true Messiah at His second coming.
[01:17:19.206 --> 01:17:29.094]  But what do you say about the phony right-wing neocon Christians that say, worship everything the ADL does, because then we're going to have a wonderful Armageddon and then we get Jesus?
[01:17:29.414 --> 01:17:30.495]  I mean, this is really twisted.
[01:17:30.675 --> 01:17:32.236]  Oh, that really is twisted.
[01:17:32.276 --> 01:17:44.439]  But the fact of the matter is that Paul in Romans is very clear that those ADL, evil Jewish leaders and people who absolutely reject Christ are not the true children of God.
[01:17:44.459 --> 01:17:45.920]  They're the broken off branches
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:49.363]  They are withered and they are dried and they are cast away.
[01:17:49.743 --> 01:18:00.472]  But there is a predestined remnant, I believe and I teach, that could even be in existence today within the nation Israel, which will someday see through how A.D.L.
[01:18:00.512 --> 01:18:06.197]  B'nai B'rith, these pharisaic leaders, have so tragically led them astray over the millennia.
[01:18:06.217 --> 01:18:11.882]  Well, I mean, if the word gets out that these pharisees microwaved 100,000 Jewish children, I think it's over for them.
[01:18:12.462 --> 01:18:16.785]  Well, what I'm doing is I'm broadcasting in very specific terms.
[01:18:16.845 --> 01:18:27.791]  I've been on well over 140 broadcasts, closer to 150 now in the last 13 months, and in every one of those broadcasts, practically, I've had liberty to roast the ADL.
[01:18:27.831 --> 01:18:31.413]  I've been able to hold them up to very specific scrutiny.
[01:18:31.433 --> 01:18:37.856]  Well, I'll tell you what, when we get back, let's specifically talk about the legislation, because folks, we're very close to passing it.
[01:18:38.276 --> 01:18:39.137]  ADL written.
[01:18:39.957 --> 01:18:41.218]  And it's going to be used.
[01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:42.719]  Free speech will be gone.
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:45.762]  And talk radio will be gone, folks.
[01:18:45.802 --> 01:18:49.865]  They will start prosecuting you for just anything.
[01:18:50.385 --> 01:18:51.046]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.741 --> 01:18:57.362]  When making important financial decisions, you should always know the facts.
[01:18:57.663 --> 01:19:01.164]  That's why Midas Resources is willing to pay you to read the facts.
[01:19:01.464 --> 01:19:10.328]  Midas Resources, a team of hand-picked financial specialists with decades of financial experience who are ready to provide you with state-of-the-art, up-to-date financial services.
[01:19:10.648 --> 01:19:14.609]  Midas Resources offers a host of services and stands behind their products.
[01:19:14.889 --> 01:19:19.191]  In fact, if you call and order their free Midas Report, Midas Resources will pay you.
[01:19:19.751 --> 01:19:21.632]  This detailed report will provide you with
[01:19:21.732 --> 01:19:22.092]  We're good to go.
[01:19:54.048 --> 01:19:57.310]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:57.370 --> 01:20:01.573]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.813 --> 01:20:04.595]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.795 --> 01:20:07.197]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:07.377 --> 01:20:16.022]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:16.222 --> 01:20:17.563]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[01:20:17.763 --> 01:20:21.886]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.886 --> 01:20:22.566]  We're good to go!
[01:20:51.044 --> 01:20:52.705]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:54.367 --> 01:20:56.849]  David J. Smith for News Watch Magazine.
[01:20:57.529 --> 01:21:06.137]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[01:21:07.097 --> 01:21:12.041]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[01:21:13.102 --> 01:21:14.924]  This is minimum infringement.
[01:21:15.324 --> 01:21:16.105]  There may be more.
[01:21:17.273 --> 01:21:24.077]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[01:21:24.757 --> 01:21:32.601]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:33.462 --> 01:21:35.003]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:35.363]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:47.470 --> 01:21:48.093]  Call now.
[01:21:48.294 --> 01:21:51.008]  Our operators are standing by to take your order.
[01:21:54.753 --> 01:22:02.658]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[01:22:03.239 --> 01:22:04.559]  What happened to those prices?
[01:22:05.100 --> 01:22:06.801]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:14.366]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[01:22:14.807 --> 01:22:15.347]  The result?
[01:22:15.787 --> 01:22:17.068]  Inflation was born.
[01:22:17.548 --> 01:22:19.630]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[01:22:21.592 --> 01:22:22.476]  What can you do about it?
[01:22:22.918 --> 01:22:25.228]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[01:22:26.050 --> 01:22:31.392]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[01:22:31.832 --> 01:22:36.994]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[01:22:37.434 --> 01:22:39.915]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[01:22:39.935 --> 01:22:41.836]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:44.857]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now.
[01:23:08.906 --> 01:23:13.787]  And of course there are all these other forces that want to restrict free speech.
[01:23:15.387 --> 01:23:20.148]  They want to put in electronic voting machines, totally fraud driven, so you can't truly vote.
[01:23:20.188 --> 01:23:23.428]  They're turning grand juries and juries into rubber stamps.
[01:23:24.329 --> 01:23:28.769]  Now there's all these organizations, but leading the charge is the ADL, which is a globalist plan.
[01:23:29.490 --> 01:23:32.050]  And then as this tyranny comes in, Jews will be blamed.
[01:23:33.192 --> 01:23:35.593]  This is very sophisticated.
[01:23:35.613 --> 01:23:37.913]  This is how the New World Order operates.
[01:23:38.893 --> 01:23:40.874]  And we're talking to Pastor Ted Pike.
[01:23:41.234 --> 01:23:43.955]  Pastor, give us your website so they can see all the documentation on this.
[01:23:44.255 --> 01:23:55.958]  Yes, we have many dozens of very interesting, short, but very easy to read articles all about the hate crimes, the philosophy, and that's at www.truthtellers.org.
[01:23:56.358 --> 01:23:56.618]  That's
[01:24:00.996 --> 01:24:01.536]  Tellers.org.
[01:24:04.037 --> 01:24:08.159]  Now, this legislation has passed the House, and it could pass the Senate.
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:10.441]  How do we defeat it?
[01:24:11.021 --> 01:24:27.689]  Well, what we have to do right now, folks, is to call today, right after you are done with listening to Genesis Today, during daylight hours, you call your members of Congress, and here is the toll-free number to your senator or congressman.
[01:24:28.249 --> 01:24:28.369]  It's 877
[01:24:31.392 --> 01:24:32.133]  877-762-8762.
[01:24:34.734 --> 01:24:39.837]  Again, the toll-free number to Congress is 877-762-8762.
[01:24:39.857 --> 01:24:52.745]  You just let them know in very certain terms that if you find out that they are voting for the big federal hate bill that's H.R.
[01:24:53.065 --> 01:24:53.405]  2662 or S. 1145
[01:24:58.758 --> 01:25:02.761]  Then you are not going to vote them back into Congress next time.
[01:25:03.422 --> 01:25:14.350]  These members of Congress, they might fear the EDL, but they really do fear their constituents, because those constituents can put them out of a career when they remember in November.
[01:25:14.650 --> 01:25:20.915]  Pastor Pike, this will be the fifth time we beat it, if we beat it this time, but they just keep coming back, they're doing it at the state level.
[01:25:22.075 --> 01:25:27.697]  Yes, they have vowed they are never going to quit until they have established an anti-hate bureaucracy.
[01:25:27.717 --> 01:25:29.577]  Well, we need to get off of the defensive.
[01:25:29.617 --> 01:25:36.239]  We need to go ahead and call, but get off the defensive and get federal laws passed reaffirming the First Amendment.
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:42.521]  And the Fourteenth Amendment, which bans the government from pandering to some special interest group.
[01:25:42.902 --> 01:25:50.744]  Now, I should mention that you probably, people especially in the East Coast, may have stinking liberal congressmen and senators
[01:25:51.244 --> 01:25:53.185]  Don't let that dissuade you.
[01:25:53.225 --> 01:25:56.086]  Go to the government website or go to your local library.
[01:25:56.386 --> 01:26:01.408]  Get a list, especially of the Republican members of the House and Senate.
[01:26:01.728 --> 01:26:05.110]  And spend a few hours making use of this toll-free number.
[01:26:05.658 --> 01:26:06.299]  I don't know.
[01:26:23.923 --> 01:26:35.995]  You know, you could go out this afternoon, you could go to a softball game, you could consume a couple of hours of time just watching people throw a ball back and forth on a sunny afternoon.
[01:26:36.376 --> 01:26:45.105]  Or you could get to these members, Republican members of the House and Senate, you could spend two hours without even a nickel of your money being spent.
[01:26:45.425 --> 01:26:51.087]  We're calling this toll-free number and you could powerfully impact them today to hold back this anti-terror activity.
[01:26:51.107 --> 01:26:53.187]  And by the way, you know, the calls do matter.
[01:26:53.307 --> 01:27:01.550]  MTV every year will take a whole day, Sumner Redstone, and just put the phone number up and show quote people who were killed by haters.
[01:27:02.190 --> 01:27:03.791]  Well, they all got charged with crimes.
[01:27:04.331 --> 01:27:08.352]  But then, you know, call the number, call Congress, say pass the hate crime law.
[01:27:09.073 --> 01:27:11.415]  And they don't even tell people what is in the law.
[01:27:13.356 --> 01:27:27.988]  The homosexual lobby has 30 million dollars and millions and millions of passionate homosexuals who are calling these toll free numbers are impacting Congress and surely if the forces of the Antichrist can do that
[01:27:28.568 --> 01:27:35.355]  The Church of God in America can set aside a day in their church on the weekend.
[01:27:35.455 --> 01:27:40.660]  Of course, under 501c3, which is a total smokescreen, churches better not talk that.
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:48.548]  Well, I think we're going to have to, you know, like the Hebrews under Pharaoh, we're going to have to bend the law here, because otherwise we're going to end up in abuse.
[01:27:48.608 --> 01:27:50.710]  Well, the law is a fraud to begin with!
[01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:56.731]  The government can make no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.
[01:27:57.211 --> 01:28:01.932]  Well, God himself has ordained this wonderful republic as an integral part of the truth.
[01:28:02.012 --> 01:28:03.212]  But what about Romans 13?
[01:28:03.252 --> 01:28:05.073]  I thought we should worship the government.
[01:28:05.253 --> 01:28:05.753]  That's right.
[01:28:05.813 --> 01:28:13.194]  Well, God is very concerned that the United States of America be preserved with enough free speech to continue to spread the good news of the gospel.
[01:28:13.214 --> 01:28:15.114]  Well, the point is, we are the government.
[01:28:15.414 --> 01:28:15.935]  That's right.
[01:28:16.135 --> 01:28:17.915]  And we are going to follow the government.
[01:28:17.935 --> 01:28:18.355]  You bet.
[01:28:18.855 --> 01:28:23.398]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with Pastor Ted Pike to go over some of the things this will do.
[01:28:23.458 --> 01:28:24.479]  I mean, this isn't a joke.
[01:28:25.599 --> 01:28:27.661]  And this is going to be used on the left, too, folks.
[01:28:27.681 --> 01:28:29.002]  This is going to be used on everybody.
[01:28:29.742 --> 01:28:32.464]  You understand it's the end of free speech in America.
[01:28:33.044 --> 01:28:35.846]  They're openly saying they want to shut websites down.
[01:28:36.366 --> 01:28:38.788]  They're openly wanting to shut down talk radio.
[01:28:39.248 --> 01:28:40.669]  This is not a joke.
[01:28:40.689 --> 01:28:41.389]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.871 --> 01:28:44.792]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.252 --> 01:28:46.753]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.731 --> 01:28:50.512]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.153 --> 01:28:57.574]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[01:28:57.814 --> 01:29:00.635]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[01:29:00.955 --> 01:29:04.996]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[01:29:05.216 --> 01:29:14.519]  From the rainforests of Southeast Asia, this small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[01:29:14.819 --> 01:29:19.724]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[01:29:20.004 --> 01:29:23.948]  Loaded with Xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found.
[01:29:24.088 --> 01:29:31.115]  Fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and sleep.
[01:29:31.175 --> 01:29:31.976]  So much more.
[01:29:32.196 --> 01:29:38.243]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the Mangosteen with Zango, the original Mangosteen functional health beverage.

[01:30:06.685 --> 01:30:11.207]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.287 --> 01:30:22.612]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul tastes and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.212 --> 01:30:30.055]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[01:30:33.076 --> 01:30:38.057]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 post-filter elements.

[01:32:23.446 --> 01:32:27.448]  Whether it's Pat Robertson saying forced abortion and infanticide in China is good.
[01:32:29.289 --> 01:32:32.130]  Or whether it's, you know, George Bush and the gay prostitutes.
[01:32:32.591 --> 01:32:33.211]  It doesn't matter.
[01:32:33.231 --> 01:32:34.031]  We cover it all.
[01:32:34.792 --> 01:32:35.952]  We expose the Democrats.
[01:32:36.533 --> 01:32:36.873]  All of it.
[01:32:36.893 --> 01:32:39.294]  It's all controlled by the globalists, just like the ADL are.
[01:32:41.161 --> 01:32:44.642]  Anybody that tries to take your freedom, we go after them, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:45.982 --> 01:32:50.984]  I know Ron and Ken and Chris and Elias and David and others are holding.
[01:32:51.004 --> 01:32:52.804]  We're going to get to your calls here in a few minutes.
[01:32:54.905 --> 01:32:56.525]  And I've got a bunch of other news I want to cover.
[01:32:56.565 --> 01:33:00.286]  New developments on the British SAS soldiers caught carrying out terror attacks.
[01:33:01.384 --> 01:33:03.705]  More news on the satanic activities of Tony Blair.
[01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:04.726]  Mainstream news.
[01:33:04.766 --> 01:33:05.546]  New developments there.
[01:33:06.107 --> 01:33:09.208]  More on the new hurricane coming right towards us here in Texas.
[01:33:09.809 --> 01:33:10.989]  Now a Category 4.
[01:33:11.349 --> 01:33:11.970]  Could even go up to 5.
[01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:14.471]  I mean, this sucker is moving.
[01:33:16.232 --> 01:33:20.674]  He is spinning with speeds of over 130 miles per hour.
[01:33:21.675 --> 01:33:27.418]  But before we go back to Pastor Pike here, don't wait, my friends.
[01:33:28.772 --> 01:33:31.493]  Number one, my videos are powerful, they're informative.
[01:33:31.553 --> 01:33:36.175]  I carry a bunch of other great videos and books and books on tape on CD and cassette.
[01:33:36.736 --> 01:33:38.636]  Some of the best works out there, bar none.
[01:33:39.037 --> 01:33:41.278]  But it also makes this broadcast possible.
[01:33:42.198 --> 01:33:45.139]  And I want you, when you get my videos, to make copies of them.
[01:33:45.179 --> 01:33:57.585]  The power of you, the listener, getting my films and making copies of them and giving them to others and telling them to make copies is exponential, is earth-shattering, mountain-moving.
[01:33:59.537 --> 01:34:14.152]  So PLEASE get Road to Tyranny, please get my new miniseries film, The Masters of Terror, or please get Matrix of Evil, or again, the new miniseries film, Martial Law, 911, Rise of the Police State.
[01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:16.711]  These are so important.
[01:34:16.771 --> 01:34:18.373]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:34:18.773 --> 01:34:20.354]  Read descriptions of the films.
[01:34:20.955 --> 01:34:23.957]  Watch lengthy free segments and clips of the videos.
[01:34:24.337 --> 01:34:27.880]  Look at the different specials we're offering and take advantage of them.
[01:34:27.920 --> 01:34:32.484]  People want to donate all the time and I say, you know, I don't really ask for those, though they're always appreciated.
[01:34:32.704 --> 01:34:34.205]  Because we've got a lot more we need to do.
[01:34:34.245 --> 01:34:35.046]  We need your support.
[01:34:36.607 --> 01:34:40.250]  But at the same time, the donation can just be getting a bunch of the videos.
[01:34:40.650 --> 01:34:42.112]  Taking advantage of those specials.
[01:34:42.192 --> 01:34:43.833]  Because then the material gets out.
[01:34:44.648 --> 01:34:52.319]  So PLEASE take action.
[01:34:52.339 --> 01:34:55.763]  1-888-253-3139 is the toll-free number to call and order the videos or books.
[01:34:56.885 --> 01:34:58.167]  And they can answer all your questions.
[01:34:59.944 --> 01:35:13.652]  about what the films cover, or about different specials, or go to infowars.com to order hard copies via the Safe Square Shopping Cart, or again that number, 888-253-3139, or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704, and never forget prisonplanet.tv.
[01:35:24.037 --> 01:35:33.264]  Or all the films and dozens of other films we've been authorized to post are there on the site, including Ted Pike's, one of his great videos, exposing the hate laws.
[01:35:33.484 --> 01:35:34.484]  Exposing what they're really up to.
[01:35:34.504 --> 01:35:37.226]  We'll tell you how to get hard copies of those in a few minutes from Ted Pike.
[01:35:37.627 --> 01:35:39.928]  Ted, quickly, because I want to go to calls before you have to leave us.
[01:35:40.589 --> 01:35:46.052]  Quickly, go through some of the 14 points they're globally calling for and what would be considered a hate crime.
[01:35:46.993 --> 01:35:49.615]  Under what they're calling for, Mel Gibson would be arrested.
[01:35:50.279 --> 01:35:51.320]  Yes, the U.S.
[01:35:51.360 --> 01:36:06.130]  State Department now, in its global anti-Semitism report, which you can personally get from the State Department website, throughout this 40-page document, they lay down these 14 criteria of what they consider anti-Semitism.
[01:36:06.150 --> 01:36:16.537]  Now, very briefly, true anti-Semitism says that Jews are evil, degenerate, subversive, corruptive, all those things, just because of their genetics.
[01:36:16.957 --> 01:36:21.659]  Because they are Jewish and have mis-evolved or something like that.
[01:36:21.719 --> 01:36:22.900]  That's what Hitler believed.
[01:36:23.160 --> 01:36:27.282]  That's what the KKK believes and other white supremacist groups and so on.
[01:36:27.662 --> 01:36:31.143]  I repudiate that racist definition of Jews.
[01:36:31.203 --> 01:36:39.407]  I believe if Jewish leaders are evil, they have become evil because of their own moral decisions away from truth and toward evil.
[01:36:39.907 --> 01:36:46.073]  But the Department of Antisemitism does not define antisemitism in those terms.
[01:36:46.413 --> 01:36:59.965]  It says, number one, any assertion, quote, that the Jewish community controls government, the media, international business, and the financial world, unquote, is antisemitic.
[01:37:01.460 --> 01:37:03.281]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:37:04.081 --> 01:37:04.741]  Let me just stop you.
[01:37:04.901 --> 01:37:06.282]  I don't care what somebody says.
[01:37:06.322 --> 01:37:19.427]  If they say Jews are God, or if they say Jews have Easter bunnies in their head, or if Jews say that whites are evil, or blacks say whites are evil, I don't care because it's the First Amendment.
[01:37:19.787 --> 01:37:28.971]  So regardless, I want all the free speech protected, but the point is, folks, they are really boiling it down to just anything being illegal.
[01:37:28.991 --> 01:37:29.271]  Go ahead.
[01:37:29.791 --> 01:37:52.548]  That's right, and impeccable Jewish sources like the Encyclopedia Judaica and other notable Jewish authors very candidly admit that virtually all the Hollywood studios were founded and controlled by Jews, all of the three major TV networks were founded and controlled by Jews and so on, and even the Jews boast of this and are proud of that fact.
[01:37:52.848 --> 01:37:59.492]  And yet for a Gentile to make that assertion, according to the Department of Anti-Semitism, is now anti-Semitic.
[01:38:00.253 --> 01:38:07.217]  And at number two it says that, quote, strong anti-Israel sentiment, unquote, is anti-Semitic.
[01:38:07.538 --> 01:38:18.725]  So if you feel strongly that Ariel Sharon behaved like a Nazi in invading the West Bank several years ago, raining hellfire missiles on hapless Palestinian people in their towns,
[01:38:19.165 --> 01:38:22.228]  That is considered anti-semitic now by the U.S.
[01:38:22.268 --> 01:38:22.748]  government.
[01:38:22.848 --> 01:38:26.291]  So half the Jews in Israel are against their own, so they're anti-semitic?
[01:38:26.431 --> 01:38:32.736]  That's right, and people like Rabbi Lappin, who may be critical of this false leadership, are now anti-semitic.
[01:38:33.257 --> 01:38:42.384]  Number three, it says that, quote, virulent criticism, unquote, of Israel's leaders, past or present, is now anti-semitic.
[01:38:42.744 --> 01:38:46.167]  So if, it gives an example here, it says that a cartoon
[01:38:47.635 --> 01:39:01.550]  It uses the word Nazi, for example, to describe Ariel Sharon and his saturation bombing of the refugee camps in Lebanon back in 1982, in which 17,500 refugees were bombed into extinction.
[01:39:01.890 --> 01:39:04.393]  If you use the word Nazi in a cartoon about that,
[01:39:04.953 --> 01:39:09.236]  Hold on, a Nazi wouldn't use the word Nazi for Sharon.
[01:39:09.997 --> 01:39:11.098]  A Nazi loves Hitler.
[01:39:11.158 --> 01:39:14.700]  I get criticized all the time for saying Hitler isn't loving and good, because he wasn't.
[01:39:15.061 --> 01:39:17.082]  Well, this reflects the Israeli policy.
[01:39:17.122 --> 01:39:25.088]  You know, Knesset passed a law that no member of Knesset may describe verbally any actions of the Sharon government.
[01:39:25.368 --> 01:39:28.551]  And those are Jews, and the Knesset can't say that.
[01:39:28.771 --> 01:39:32.654]  Yeah, they can't portray or regard any actions of the
[01:39:33.534 --> 01:39:34.234]  We're good to go.
[01:39:49.199 --> 01:39:54.525]  Why we can't get into more violence and anti-semitism, real racism and anti-semitism.
[01:39:54.685 --> 01:40:00.350]  We have to keep following the biblical balance on this very, very sensitive intellectual issue.
[01:40:00.611 --> 01:40:01.652]  Yeah, it is complex.
[01:40:01.752 --> 01:40:02.472]  Please continue.
[01:40:02.673 --> 01:40:08.799]  But number four, it says criticism of the Jewish religion or its religious leaders or literature.
[01:40:09.498 --> 01:40:13.161]  Uh, especially the Talmud and Kabbalah is anti-Semitic.
[01:40:13.181 --> 01:40:14.582]  That's not a quote, that's a summary.
[01:40:14.602 --> 01:40:19.766]  Well, there's a hundred groups of Jews fighting with each other like there's 5,000 sects of Christians.
[01:40:20.306 --> 01:40:20.906]  Absolutely.
[01:40:20.946 --> 01:40:23.348]  I mean, that's all these religions do is fight with each other.
[01:40:23.428 --> 01:40:28.492]  Yeah, now if you go to the Babylonian Talmud or the Zohar or Kabbalah, you'll find that they're full.
[01:40:28.932 --> 01:40:40.258]  Of hatred against Christians, of hatred against Gentiles, full of dreams of world ambition, and all that kind of thing, and yet to say those things in public is now anti-Semitic, according to the State Department.
[01:40:40.838 --> 01:40:43.039]  It says, number five, criticism of the U.S.
[01:40:43.159 --> 01:40:53.284]  government and Congress for being under undue influence by the Jewish Zionist community, including AIPAC, is anti-Semitic.
[01:40:53.744 --> 01:41:03.729]  And so, we are supposed to, like the people with the Emperor, who has no clothes, we are to deny that this huge lobby has any influence in Congress.
[01:41:04.329 --> 01:41:08.291]  The truth of the matter is that everyone knows that AIPAC dominates Congress.
[01:41:08.311 --> 01:41:10.272]  Well, the truth is, it's a Siamese twin.
[01:41:10.572 --> 01:41:14.254]  That's right, and yet that's anti-Semitic now, to make that assertion.
[01:41:15.295 --> 01:41:17.276]  But Ariel Sharon said he owned Congress.
[01:41:17.536 --> 01:41:18.156]  Yeah, right.
[01:41:18.596 --> 01:41:20.938]  If any Christian blames Jewish
[01:41:21.858 --> 01:41:22.739]  We're good to go.
[01:41:37.495 --> 01:41:39.016]  It makes them all anti-semitic.
[01:41:39.056 --> 01:41:45.161]  It makes tens of millions... But that doesn't make any... I mean, everybody knows that the Jewish leadership didn't like Christ.
[01:41:45.181 --> 01:41:47.182]  Just like they killed a lot of prophets.
[01:41:47.563 --> 01:41:48.844]  You know, Christ, of course, being God.
[01:41:48.904 --> 01:41:52.747]  And said, killing... And then Pilate said, this man has done nothing wrong.
[01:41:52.787 --> 01:41:53.727]  I defy no fault.
[01:41:54.128 --> 01:41:56.029]  And they said, give us Barabbas.
[01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:58.351]  I mean, that's even in the Roman histories.
[01:41:58.391 --> 01:41:58.891]  Oh, yeah.
[01:41:59.191 --> 01:42:01.593]  It's so well documented in the New Testament.
[01:42:01.613 --> 01:42:05.036]  But you see, what they're wanting to do, Alex, is to put a noose around
[01:42:05.576 --> 01:42:10.079]  You know what, I think these big Christian churches will stop teaching the Bible.
[01:42:10.559 --> 01:42:14.561]  They'll probably say Jesus was never crucified.
[01:42:14.601 --> 01:42:27.848]  That's what's happened in Canada where many Christians, even Joppa Christians today believe that we all killed Christ vicariously and therefore we can escape description as being anti-Semitic, but it's not going to work.
[01:42:29.269 --> 01:42:39.054]  Here's the analogy, when Moses came back down the mountain and he caught them back to the Babylon mystery religion, or back to the Egyptian mystery religion, he blasted them.
[01:42:41.956 --> 01:42:47.059]  That's like saying, if we say Hitler was bad, we're saying all Germans are evil.
[01:42:47.619 --> 01:42:54.143]  To say that there were evil leaders who had Christ killed, it was the governor who
[01:42:55.183 --> 01:43:07.695]  Yes, what this is doing in a nutshell is it's making the New Testament into anti-Semitic hate literature.
[01:43:08.035 --> 01:43:14.521]  Now what it wants to do, as in Canada, is to force pastors and Christians not to quote
[01:43:14.986 --> 01:43:17.987]  These scriptures against the Jews because they are anti-semitic.
[01:43:18.327 --> 01:43:31.412]  Now, the Christians are going to have to make a choice because Jesus said, if you're ashamed of me and my words in this wicked and perverse generation, I'm going to be ashamed of you before the holy angels when I come in my kingdom.
[01:43:31.892 --> 01:43:41.136]  And if we are ashamed to preach from the gospel and from the pulpit that the Jewish leaders masterminded the crucifixion, it says Jesus is going to be ashamed of us.
[01:43:41.778 --> 01:43:46.480]  And the truth of the matter is that Jesus Christ would be in a hate crimes prison.
[01:43:46.500 --> 01:43:50.441]  He'd probably be sitting next to Ernst Zundel right now if he were alive today.
[01:43:50.461 --> 01:43:51.922]  That's how serious this is.
[01:43:53.002 --> 01:43:57.304]  So what they're wanting to do is make all these Christians into anti-Semites.
[01:43:57.404 --> 01:44:07.448]  And paradoxically, these are the very Christians who throughout the entirety of this century have made it possible for Israel to be established in the Middle East and rise
[01:44:08.068 --> 01:44:13.015]  into status as the number two or three military power in the world.
[01:44:13.095 --> 01:44:14.116]  And now, A.D.
[01:44:14.196 --> 01:44:21.245]  Al-Banibrith is turning on these benevolent Christians who are fanatical in their love toward Israel and calling them anti-Semites.
[01:44:21.485 --> 01:44:22.567]  How's that for gratitude?
[01:44:23.254 --> 01:44:25.775]  And Rabbi Lappin and others have talked about that.
[01:44:26.075 --> 01:44:31.137]  Yes, and Rabbi Lappin is warning the Christians on Trinity Broadcasting.
[01:44:31.157 --> 01:44:40.320]  He says, you better face the facts now that organized, secular Judaism, meaning benign Barith, is in relentless attack on evangelical Christians.
[01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:45.141]  Now listen, the rest of Trinity Broadcasting, that horrible creature Crouch, is worshipping this.
[01:44:45.461 --> 01:44:47.542]  How are they even letting Lappin do that?
[01:44:48.332 --> 01:44:49.112]  Well, I don't know.
[01:44:49.133 --> 01:44:55.175]  He made a bold statement, and I read another quote here from an interview.
[01:44:56.156 --> 01:44:58.537]  I've communicated my emails to him.
[01:44:58.597 --> 01:45:10.342]  I'm encouraging him to take the initiative now and start a movement to lead Jews of good intention away from subservience and bondage to this very evil leadership throughout the world.
[01:45:11.623 --> 01:45:14.484]  Now, what it boils down to is once they have
[01:45:14.969 --> 01:45:15.390]  I think so.
[01:45:30.425 --> 01:45:32.906]  You know, I have FEMA on video.
[01:45:32.946 --> 01:45:34.726]  Have you ever seen my film, Road to Tyranny?
[01:45:35.247 --> 01:45:35.727]  No, I haven't.
[01:45:36.067 --> 01:45:46.110]  Well, a Kansas City firefighter sent me the tape, and this was also in the training manuals, and they just teach that all Christians are terrorists, the Founding Fathers were bad, and that they're enemies of the federal government.
[01:45:46.770 --> 01:45:47.531]  Yes.
[01:45:47.551 --> 01:45:48.751]  Those are actual quotes.
[01:45:49.191 --> 01:45:57.414]  That's right, and in Canada today, right now, if I had a friend in Canada and I asked him very pointedly, I'd say, what would happen?
[01:45:57.944 --> 01:46:00.749]  If you were to speak in public, say in public...
[01:46:01.252 --> 01:46:03.273]  Of that the Jews killed Jesus Christ.
[01:46:03.574 --> 01:46:08.357]  And he said, everybody up here knows that if you were to do that, you'd be playing with fire.
[01:46:09.577 --> 01:46:13.540]  Somebody might call the police, and the police might come, and you would be arrested.
[01:46:13.580 --> 01:46:16.642]  Regardless of whether you agree with that or not, it's free speech.
[01:46:16.822 --> 01:46:18.143]  Let's take a few calls.
[01:46:19.083 --> 01:46:22.465]  Folks, this bill has passed the House, it's in the Senate now.
[01:46:23.006 --> 01:46:26.908]  You better call the House and the Senate, because then we'll go back to conference when the Senate passes it.
[01:46:27.248 --> 01:46:28.529]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[01:46:28.629 --> 01:46:29.370]  Ron, you're on the air.
[01:46:30.497 --> 01:46:31.418]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:46:31.658 --> 01:46:31.938]  Hi.
[01:46:32.259 --> 01:46:34.280]  Oh, and there has to be some mistake here.
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:39.624]  You can't be telling me that the good old Republican neocon majority in the U.S.
[01:46:39.664 --> 01:46:43.826]  House of Representatives who will say they don't want government in our lives would have passed this bill.
[01:46:44.667 --> 01:46:47.769]  I mean, you know, Bubba good old boy would never believe that.
[01:46:48.630 --> 01:46:49.310]  Well, it happened.
[01:46:49.390 --> 01:46:50.351]  It was a vote by 223 to 199.
[01:46:50.391 --> 01:46:50.511]  Right.
[01:46:50.591 --> 01:46:51.792]  Well, maybe we should ban the Bible.
[01:46:56.653 --> 01:47:01.114]  I mean, they, uh, in Pennsylvania a few years ago, they did ban reading from, uh, certain passages of it.
[01:47:01.154 --> 01:47:04.895]  That's... I mean, maybe, maybe, maybe we're not Christian if we don't ban it.
[01:47:05.175 --> 01:47:09.356]  Well, you know how they're going to probably try to promote and sell this law onto the larger portion of people.
[01:47:09.376 --> 01:47:16.317]  They'll have some degenerate, toothless Ku Klux Klan member dancing around, screaming racism, saying he hates the bill.
[01:47:16.557 --> 01:47:17.197]  Better than that.
[01:47:17.337 --> 01:47:21.358]  They've got to convince Bubba Good Ol' Boy to act against his interests, and you know what they're going to do?
[01:47:21.758 --> 01:47:28.406]  They're going to tell him, well, this bill, Sadovalche, they're going to infer, this bill is against the imams who are speaking against the country and the mosques.
[01:47:28.867 --> 01:47:32.591]  But I have a little something to tell of a good old boy.
[01:47:33.172 --> 01:47:36.076]  He will be the first persecuted under this bill.
[01:47:36.576 --> 01:47:38.559]  He will be persecuted when he objects
[01:47:38.899 --> 01:47:41.282]  I'll tell you, I've had a million moms hit me with signs.
[01:47:41.342 --> 01:47:46.609]  I've had the Democrats pop me on the head when I'm not even there protesting them.
[01:47:56.181 --> 01:48:05.149]  And I've had a lady, an oriental lady, an Asian lady, grab my biceps with her fingers, and the police saw it and she grabbed me viciously.
[01:48:05.449 --> 01:48:06.130]  They did nothing.
[01:48:06.410 --> 01:48:07.851]  And Mike Hanson was assaulted.
[01:48:07.871 --> 01:48:09.032]  And it's all on video.
[01:48:09.052 --> 01:48:10.073]  They hit with a cane.
[01:48:10.674 --> 01:48:13.076]  None of this, and the police won't do a thing, folks!
[01:48:13.096 --> 01:48:13.976]  Correctively enforced.
[01:48:14.056 --> 01:48:16.078]  In the state of New York, we have a hate crimes bill.
[01:48:16.659 --> 01:48:22.804]  Since the inception and enactment of that bill, that bill and the hate crimes law has never been enforced with equity.
[01:48:23.450 --> 01:48:24.832]  It has never been enforced equally.
[01:48:25.192 --> 01:48:28.637]  And as to the ADL... But even if it was forced equally, it's wrong!
[01:48:28.997 --> 01:48:30.439]  It was right, it's wrong even so.
[01:48:30.499 --> 01:48:35.025]  I'm just saying that we've got the worst of worst possible scenarios, but you're absolutely correct to say that.
[01:48:36.264 --> 01:48:48.891]  And as far as the ADL is concerned, okay, people should know something, that the ADL has been spying on American citizens, acting as a conduit agent for government agencies, passing information along to government law enforcement.
[01:48:48.911 --> 01:48:51.913]  No, they've been caught, they've been arrested, they've lost lawsuits.
[01:48:52.313 --> 01:48:56.976]  That's a fact, right, they've lost defamation lawsuits, and people should know something else, too.
[01:48:57.596 --> 01:49:03.500]  And this kind of tells you the kind of demented neurotics that you have running the ADL, who are basically instruments of higher power.
[01:49:04.020 --> 01:49:07.421]  Now, David Icke, I'm sure you're familiar with him, many in your audience are, right?
[01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:13.182]  David Icke's theories, his lizard theories are at best comical, but harmless, alright?
[01:49:13.602 --> 01:49:15.842]  Yet somehow the ADL has translated that.
[01:49:16.322 --> 01:49:19.603]  It's absurd, it's like Little Green Men from Mars and chupacabras.
[01:49:19.923 --> 01:49:25.144]  No, he's a UFO guy and they had him grabbed for saying it, saying, no, that's code word.
[01:49:25.204 --> 01:49:28.345]  They found that that absurd, like UFO talk,
[01:49:29.285 --> 01:49:31.307]  Was it danger to them and anti-semitic?
[01:49:31.347 --> 01:49:32.989]  I mean, it could be nothing more absurd.
[01:49:34.010 --> 01:49:35.731]  Like I said, it's comical, but harmless.
[01:49:35.751 --> 01:49:36.492]  No, listen, listen.
[01:49:36.572 --> 01:49:45.140]  If you criticize the IMF and World Bank, which is pretty much run by Dutch and British, they say that's anti-semitic.
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:47.262]  I mean, they actually create anti-semitism.
[01:49:48.243 --> 01:49:48.744]  Stay there.
[01:49:48.764 --> 01:49:49.845]  Ron, thanks for the call.
[01:49:50.045 --> 01:49:50.485]  Stay there.
[01:49:50.766 --> 01:49:53.028]  Pastor Plank, we'll come back and take some more calls.
[01:49:54.739 --> 01:49:57.600]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.860 --> 01:49:59.440]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[01:50:11.864 --> 01:50:13.865]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.046 --> 01:50:16.887]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.988 --> 01:50:21.651]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.851 --> 01:50:26.274]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[01:52:10.723 --> 01:52:11.324]  I think so.
[01:52:30.981 --> 01:52:34.122]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show!
[01:52:59.953 --> 01:53:08.439]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:08.479 --> 01:53:11.542]  No one is safe when we don't have a First Amendment or a Second Amendment.
[01:53:12.102 --> 01:53:17.526]  A Tenth Amendment, a Fourth Amendment, they're all being attacked or completely dismantled right now.
[01:53:17.546 --> 01:53:23.050]  And they tell the conservatives, you better ban free speech or the Arabs will get you.
[01:53:23.150 --> 01:53:25.812]  And they tell the liberals, you're not for Nazis, are you?
[01:53:26.853 --> 01:53:29.834]  And, you know, this is basically how it operates.
[01:53:31.315 --> 01:53:32.795]  And then they get these bills passed.
[01:53:32.855 --> 01:53:34.776]  And the vanguard of this is the ADL.
[01:53:37.177 --> 01:53:43.299]  Just an unbelievable organization that is just... is horrible.
[01:53:44.359 --> 01:53:47.480]  I mean, they've attacked me a few times.
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:50.781]  They never dare say I'm anti-Semitic, but they basically say everything else.
[01:53:51.402 --> 01:53:53.442]  And then they even invent statements I never made.
[01:53:56.491 --> 01:53:58.452]  On their website.
[01:53:59.133 --> 01:54:01.734]  It's incredible.
[01:54:01.894 --> 01:54:04.036]  And a lot of them are well-meaning zealots, too.
[01:54:04.056 --> 01:54:05.176]  They're in the mid-levels of this.
[01:54:07.218 --> 01:54:09.839]  But the people up top, they know what they're doing.
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:12.781]  And they understand what they're doing.
[01:54:13.081 --> 01:54:15.223]  Let's take another call for Pastor Ted Pike.
[01:54:15.243 --> 01:54:21.066]  And then we've got Ronnie Cummings, the founder and director of Organic Consumers Association, coming on for a few minutes in the next hour.
[01:54:21.086 --> 01:54:23.368]  Then I'll cover some other news, because they're about to
[01:54:26.092 --> 01:54:28.894]  Start labeling unorganic food organic.
[01:54:29.434 --> 01:54:30.615]  Big, big deal, folks.
[01:54:30.975 --> 01:54:32.556]  Just to show the level of corruption.
[01:54:33.277 --> 01:54:34.558]  Let's talk to Ken in New York.
[01:54:34.598 --> 01:54:36.219]  Ken, you're on the air with Pastor Ted Pike.
[01:54:36.239 --> 01:54:36.799]  Go ahead, Ken.
[01:54:36.819 --> 01:54:37.660]  Hi, Alex.
[01:54:37.740 --> 01:54:38.701]  Thanks.
[01:54:38.721 --> 01:54:43.764]  Mr. Pike, I believe you said this is the fifth time that they tried to pass this bill?
[01:54:44.525 --> 01:54:44.825]  Uh-huh.
[01:54:46.034 --> 01:54:49.616]  How did they succeed this time, whereas the previous four times they failed?
[01:54:49.796 --> 01:54:57.479]  Well, there's two branches of the legislature, so they've succeeded before in passing it out of one area of the Congress.
[01:54:57.499 --> 01:54:59.380]  Well, go ahead, Pastor.
[01:55:00.201 --> 01:55:03.782]  Yeah, the first time they tried was in 1999, and it's been
[01:55:05.987 --> 01:55:06.627]  I don't think so.
[01:55:26.485 --> 01:55:34.171]  We have a video, Meat Loves Meat, making criminals of Christians, which is on Alex's TV website.
[01:55:34.551 --> 01:55:45.599]  But if people would like a copy of that, that can be obtained, I should say a first generation hard copy, that can be obtained at truthtellers.org.
[01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:48.762]  Or people can just call me here at home with their credit card.
[01:55:49.262 --> 01:55:49.462]  At 503-631-3808.
[01:55:49.702 --> 01:55:51.803]  Again, that's 503-631-3808, and I'll fire them off a copy.
[01:55:51.823 --> 01:55:57.566]  We really have to get educated fast on this, and this video will be a wonderful way your church or civic organization
[01:56:09.071 --> 01:56:14.395]  Why do you think, Mr. Pike, the majority of the Christian establishment in the country like D. James Kennedy and John Hagee and
[01:56:29.305 --> 01:56:30.146]  Well, they're afraid!
[01:56:30.166 --> 01:56:32.128]  I mean, that's why we have to speak up here.
[01:56:32.168 --> 01:56:32.868]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:56:32.908 --> 01:56:35.851]  You see, hate crimes legislation can be directly traced back to ADL, B'nai B'rith.
[01:56:49.583 --> 01:57:00.688]  In fact, you know, we're talking about ADL as the culprit here, but the fact of the matter is that B'nai B'rith was responsible for establishing hate laws in Canada, as well as throughout the rest of the world.
[01:57:00.728 --> 01:57:06.290]  So we have double conspirators here, and evangelical Christian leaders know
[01:57:06.910 --> 01:57:24.376]  That the hate crimes agenda is basically the baby, the project of a huge, venerable Jewish organization which is very sensitive about being criticized and if their hate crimes agenda is criticized it will be perhaps viewed as anti-semitic and the ADL will collapse.
[01:57:24.396 --> 01:57:26.616]  Listen, Pastor, Pastor Pike, I want to thank you for coming on.
[01:57:26.997 --> 01:57:28.197]  God bless you, my friend, okay?
[01:57:28.497 --> 01:57:29.117]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:57:29.537 --> 01:57:30.138]  Keep it up.
[01:57:30.158 --> 01:57:31.418]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:38.123]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.847 --> 01:57:50.508]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.168 --> 01:57:52.249]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.930 --> 01:57:54.070]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.711 --> 01:57:55.532]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.272 --> 01:57:57.193]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.833 --> 01:58:01.496]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.017 --> 01:58:06.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.182 --> 01:58:13.306]  Alright, my friends, we are now into our number three.
[01:58:13.366 --> 01:58:16.108]  I'm your host, Alexander Emmerich Jones.
[01:58:17.879 --> 01:58:21.363]  And coming up in about five minutes, we'll tell you how they're attacking you through the food supply.
[01:58:22.084 --> 01:58:23.605]  Very important report coming up.
[01:58:24.226 --> 01:58:31.274]  And then just a host of other key issues with the British government carrying out terror attacks in Iraq.
[01:58:32.075 --> 01:58:34.617]  Just so much other key news, you do not want to miss it.
[01:58:35.418 --> 01:58:38.622]  Right now, let's go to Chris in Tennessee, then Elias.
[01:58:39.812 --> 01:58:47.777]  Hello Alex, it's my opinion that the AIPAC and ADL are both terrorist organizations.
[01:58:50.342 --> 01:58:55.828]  Rejected the UN resolutions more than any other country and they've stole our nuclear secrets time and time again.
[01:58:55.848 --> 01:58:59.673]  Well, I don't think Israel's bad for not following UN resolutions.
[01:58:59.953 --> 01:59:01.555]  This is the false left-right system.
[01:59:01.875 --> 01:59:04.979]  The globalists control the UN, who then plays good cop, bad cop.
[01:59:05.459 --> 01:59:09.564]  I agree with Barry Hamish, Jewish writer, who talks about the globalists controlling Israel.
[01:59:10.214 --> 01:59:13.556]  So, but I'm not disagreeing with you about AIPAC being bad.
[01:59:13.596 --> 01:59:13.776]  Go ahead.
[01:59:13.796 --> 01:59:22.019]  Well, I mean, the fact when Dr. Wolf was alive, he made a statement that the only thing that's come out of this Iraqi war was an oil pipeline directly from Iraq to Israel.
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:25.361]  Now, Dr. Wolf was a great, great Jewish American.
[01:59:25.461 --> 01:59:26.001]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:26.101 --> 01:59:27.422]  I really do miss him.
[01:59:27.982 --> 01:59:36.246]  And the whole thing about this is I wish we elect more Muslim people to our Congress and Senate instead of more Jewish people.
[01:59:37.268 --> 01:59:40.330]  Alex, my question today is, do you think Kam Triller... Well, let me just stop you.
[01:59:40.771 --> 01:59:46.574]  I don't care if somebody's black, hispanic, jewish, polka-dotted, as long as they love freedom, I don't care.
[01:59:47.135 --> 01:59:50.937]  So, you know, a statement about people elect who they want to elect, but go ahead, sir.
[01:59:51.098 --> 02:00:01.645]  Well, no, I'll give you that, but what I'm saying is this has happened with the Norm Charsky situation, where he defended freedom of speech, and all I'm trying to say is with these pro-Zionists... You're talking about Noam Chomsky.
[02:00:01.705 --> 02:00:02.105]  Yes, sir.
[02:00:02.285 --> 02:00:04.487]  All I'm trying to say is with this pro-Zionist view,
[02:00:05.027 --> 02:00:09.210]  They want to lack freedom of speech just to put their view out.
[02:00:09.710 --> 02:00:10.250]  I hear you.
[02:00:10.370 --> 02:00:11.731]  It's bad news.
[02:00:12.232 --> 02:00:14.033]  Jews aren't allowed to have free speech in Israel.
[02:00:14.333 --> 02:00:16.554]  If they criticize the nuclear weapons, they get arrested.
[02:00:16.995 --> 02:00:20.477]  I was even surprised that Christians in Israel have their own license plate.
[02:00:20.497 --> 02:00:21.798]  They're labeled there.
[02:00:21.978 --> 02:00:25.520]  Alex, what do you think about chemtrails affecting these hurricanes that are hitting us now?
[02:00:27.222 --> 02:00:29.403]  Well, I know there's weather modification going on.
[02:00:29.443 --> 02:00:34.846]  I don't know if this is causing it, but could other weather modification systems be causing the weather to get worse?
[02:00:35.246 --> 02:00:35.587]  Certainly.
[02:00:35.607 --> 02:00:36.287]  Thanks for the call.
[02:00:36.387 --> 02:00:36.787]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:00:36.987 --> 02:00:37.287]  You bet.
[02:00:37.328 --> 02:00:38.468]  Elias in Michigan.
[02:00:38.488 --> 02:00:39.249]  Go ahead, Elias.
[02:00:41.650 --> 02:00:43.091]  Is the pastor still on?
[02:00:43.451 --> 02:00:44.331]  No, he's gone, sir.
[02:00:45.292 --> 02:00:45.552]  Okay.
[02:00:45.812 --> 02:00:47.673]  Well, anyway.
[02:00:47.693 --> 02:00:48.814]  He was on for an hour and a half.
[02:00:48.914 --> 02:00:53.916]  He stole my fire on the Ariel Sharon, but I'll mention this.
[02:00:54.457 --> 02:00:56.598]  Ariel Sharon, of course, he massacred
[02:00:57.386 --> 02:00:59.067]  Well you know, I don't think that
[02:01:27.876 --> 02:01:28.896]  And I've studied this, sir.
[02:01:29.376 --> 02:01:31.417]  You've got evil people running things.
[02:01:31.537 --> 02:01:37.518]  Every time I really overturn a rock, it is... Yeah, he's certainly under the rock.
[02:01:38.178 --> 02:01:42.539]  There are devil worshippers under the rock, whether they're Germanic or Jewish.
[02:01:43.460 --> 02:01:45.300]  And I mean, that's really what I've discovered.
[02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:48.941]  I will come on the air and tell you what I've discovered from real research.
[02:01:49.625 --> 02:01:57.692]  And so these are evil people, and I think to just say, oh no, it's Jews, please... No, no, I don't proclaim the Jews.
[02:01:57.752 --> 02:01:59.514]  No, no, I say the State of Israel.
[02:01:59.974 --> 02:02:04.819]  And the State of Israel only uses the Jewishness of people.
[02:02:05.339 --> 02:02:06.040]  That's what they're doing.
[02:02:06.240 --> 02:02:07.041]  The State of Israel...
[02:02:08.243 --> 02:02:08.323]  Yeah.
[02:02:08.383 --> 02:02:14.705]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:14.865 --> 02:02:21.147]  We're going to be talking about organic food now for a few minutes and then get back into the news.
[02:02:21.847 --> 02:02:26.129]  But, and listen, I know it's a delicacy, a special treat to
[02:02:27.401 --> 02:02:31.143]  Just go after Jews themselves, and I'm telling you, that's bad, folks.
[02:02:31.183 --> 02:02:32.524]  That helps the New World Order.
[02:02:32.984 --> 02:02:37.007]  We have the Zionist's own documents where they say they want to create anti-Semitism.
[02:02:37.327 --> 02:02:39.568]  You understand, that is official!
[02:02:40.409 --> 02:02:42.230]  You must fight the policies!
[02:02:43.011 --> 02:02:43.651]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:45.484 --> 02:02:49.831]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.031 --> 02:02:54.458]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.598 --> 02:02:58.985]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.025 --> 02:03:00.367]  The New World Order.
[02:03:01.108 --> 02:03:02.088]  Panama!
[02:03:02.148 --> 02:03:06.349]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.429 --> 02:03:13.351]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.471 --> 02:03:15.572]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:15.872 --> 02:03:25.794]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.494 --> 02:03:31.858]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new 2.5 hour video, Police Take 3, is for you!
[02:03:32.359 --> 02:03:34.980]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:35.581]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:03:45.936 --> 02:03:55.000]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.240 --> 02:04:06.486]  Black Ferkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:06.826 --> 02:04:11.248]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and
[02:04:11.288 --> 02:04:12.069]  We're good to go!
[02:04:41.453 --> 02:04:51.196]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:04:51.216 --> 02:04:56.798]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business and the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:04:57.218 --> 02:05:00.179]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:05:46.315 --> 02:05:51.919]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:52.039 --> 02:06:08.792]  Alright, we've got Ronnie Cummins on the line with us, and he is the founder and director of the Organic Consumers Association of America.
[02:06:08.832 --> 02:06:09.832]  We'll give you the website.
[02:06:10.733 --> 02:06:11.774]  And for those that don't know,
[02:06:12.757 --> 02:06:20.023]  We've had the founder of DNA recombinant protein splicing on the broadcast from London.
[02:06:20.083 --> 02:06:35.556]  We've interviewed many top genetic engineers who were pro-genetic engineering and they found out that you change one gene in an Irish potato and you feed that to rats, they have mutations
[02:06:37.501 --> 02:06:40.864]  Post-womb, which is almost impossible, they thought.
[02:06:40.884 --> 02:06:47.009]  I mean, actual mutations, new proteins, new enzymes that we cannot absorb that are poisonous.
[02:06:48.691 --> 02:06:50.172]  And now they're doing chimeras.
[02:06:50.232 --> 02:06:51.733]  Forget changing one gene.
[02:06:51.753 --> 02:06:58.059]  They'll put four or five organisms, four or five different insects and some salmon genes into your corn or tomatoes.
[02:06:59.321 --> 02:07:00.942]  And your body doesn't know how to deal with it.
[02:07:01.002 --> 02:07:07.665]  And then the genetic engineering itself is very dangerous and could give rise to stuff that makes the avian flu look like a wonderful gift.
[02:07:09.426 --> 02:07:10.086]  Here's an example.
[02:07:10.126 --> 02:07:15.488]  They have a level 4 weapons lab in the name of fighting bio-attacks down in Galveston.
[02:07:15.829 --> 02:07:18.190]  And it's about to have probably a category 4 hurricane hit it.
[02:07:19.690 --> 02:07:21.651]  And it's not even in the level 4 laboratory.
[02:07:21.671 --> 02:07:22.171]  They have level 4
[02:07:25.529 --> 02:07:36.734]  Creatures, they have level 4 creations, they have level 4 pathogens, level 4 genetic engineered monsters in that facility, but it's not a level 4 facility.
[02:07:38.375 --> 02:07:39.656]  So, just a side issue.
[02:07:40.176 --> 02:07:45.478]  But a lot of you still eat those genetically engineered potatoes, and I try not to eat it.
[02:07:45.599 --> 02:07:46.599]  I do every once in a while.
[02:07:46.859 --> 02:07:48.360]  Believe me, if it's fast food, it is.
[02:07:49.501 --> 02:07:53.045]  And five years ago in Austin, you couldn't buy organic food.
[02:07:53.105 --> 02:07:56.768]  Now, half the food in H-E-B is supposedly organic.
[02:07:56.808 --> 02:07:58.810]  People are demanding it, so we're taking over.
[02:07:59.150 --> 02:08:00.512]  Well, the industry isn't going to have that.
[02:08:01.132 --> 02:08:08.259]  And so they're going to try to get genetically engineered food or radiated food, which totally destroys the value, certified.
[02:08:08.980 --> 02:08:12.661]  And they're trying it again, so here to join us is Ronnie Cummins.
[02:08:13.242 --> 02:08:16.723]  And sir, can you give us what they've tried in the past and now what they're trying today, please?
[02:08:16.743 --> 02:08:20.384]  Yeah, back in 1997-98, the bureaucrats in the U.S.
[02:08:20.404 --> 02:08:27.847]  Department of Agriculture said, oh yeah, it'd be okay to use genetic engineering, food irradiation, toxic sludge, pesticides, and organics.
[02:08:28.186 --> 02:08:31.808]  There was a huge backlash from organic consumers across the country.
[02:08:31.828 --> 02:08:38.511]  Well, everybody knows toxic sludge and radiation is organic luscious food.
[02:08:38.731 --> 02:08:43.974]  In conventional agriculture, it's routine nowadays to have food irradiation.
[02:08:44.334 --> 02:08:51.358]  It's routine to take municipal sewage sludge and industrial sewage sludge and put it on farmland.
[02:08:51.398 --> 02:08:54.560]  And that's where hepatitis C explosions are really coming from.
[02:08:54.580 --> 02:08:56.501]  CDC's own documents.
[02:08:56.541 --> 02:08:56.921]  Go ahead.
[02:08:57.555 --> 02:09:07.321]  Yeah, so basically the USDA feels constrained by having citizens have any checks and balances over organic standards.
[02:09:07.781 --> 02:09:23.791]  So what's happened is that lobbyists for big corporations that are trying to take over the organic industry have convinced the Senate this week to vote on an amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations Bill that would basically change the way
[02:09:24.275 --> 02:09:26.557]  Organic standards are controlled in the U.S.
[02:09:41.870 --> 02:09:46.153]  Criminal, that is, and even the organic milk companies have been sued.
[02:09:46.533 --> 02:09:50.335]  They're not even allowed to say that, you know, this hormone's bad for you.
[02:09:50.636 --> 02:09:55.318]  They can just mention that the growth hormone isn't in it.
[02:09:55.378 --> 02:09:57.600]  I mean, they don't want us knowing this, do they?
[02:09:58.260 --> 02:09:58.780]  They don't.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:03.323]  And the only thing that keeps them in check is the fear of the grassroots.
[02:10:03.383 --> 02:10:09.547]  I mean, all these people in Congress and the bureaucrats in the USDA, they've got these cushy jobs which they're afraid of losing.
[02:10:10.000 --> 02:10:10.260]  So it's
[02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:32.502]  Sure, the politicians know they're going to pay a heavy price.
[02:10:33.023 --> 02:10:37.626]  Well, I just ate a big ol' fat organic apple, and man, it tastes so much better.
[02:10:37.726 --> 02:10:41.889]  Why would anybody want to eat this stuff splattered with sewage?
[02:10:43.090 --> 02:10:44.291]  Exactly, yeah.
[02:10:44.918 --> 02:10:46.139]  You know, we're extreme though.
[02:10:46.179 --> 02:10:48.620]  We should want to eat hepatitis covered lettuce.
[02:10:48.860 --> 02:10:51.802]  By the way, folks, back in 97, remember Clinton got in all that trouble?
[02:10:52.062 --> 02:10:59.727]  The school lunch program, the federal government bought all those raspberries and strawberries coated with hepatitis C from Mexico City sewage.
[02:10:59.787 --> 02:11:01.788]  I mean, folks, this is really happening.
[02:11:03.829 --> 02:11:04.390]  Exactly.
[02:11:04.450 --> 02:11:07.372]  That's why we say SOS, Save Organic Standards.
[02:11:07.432 --> 02:11:08.732]  Stand up for your rights.
[02:11:09.093 --> 02:11:11.174]  Every time you pull out your wallet, beware.
[02:11:11.847 --> 02:11:12.547]  What's wrong with Hepatitis C?
[02:11:12.567 --> 02:11:13.508]  Isn't that a nice gift for your family?
[02:11:28.791 --> 02:11:30.453]  Yeah, I mean, let your family die, folks.
[02:11:30.473 --> 02:11:31.193]  Don't listen to us.
[02:11:32.114 --> 02:11:38.579]  Of course, I'm being sarcastic, but I don't think people realize... Okay, tell us what the bills are right now, what we're facing, how we defeat it.
[02:11:38.599 --> 02:11:46.965]  Then I want to specifically talk about some of the genetically modified foods that are out there, some of the food crops, and I want to go over irradiation and your expertise, sir.
[02:11:47.565 --> 02:11:54.851]  Okay, it's the Senate appropriations bill for this year, or for 2006, that the U.S.
[02:11:55.031 --> 02:11:57.613]  Senate's voting on this week.
[02:11:58.234 --> 02:12:00.436]  So all you need to do is call your Senator.
[02:12:01.377 --> 02:12:02.878]  I can give you a toll-free number.
[02:12:02.978 --> 02:12:04.399]  And is that in the bill right now?
[02:12:05.100 --> 02:12:13.026]  It's going to be an amendment offered from the floor by some anonymous Senator who is afraid to go public with this.
[02:12:13.507 --> 02:12:18.731]  The vote will be taken in secret with no roll call and they'll tell us about it afterwards.
[02:12:19.231 --> 02:12:27.278]  So what's happening now is that some of the Senators are starting to see that, hey, they better not do this because there's so many people that are going to be angry.
[02:12:27.791 --> 02:12:40.838]  So, if we will call our Senators and tell them to do not support anything in the Appropriations Bill that's going to change the way organic standards... Yeah, don't put hepatitis on the table.
[02:12:41.299 --> 02:12:41.919]  Exactly.
[02:12:42.619 --> 02:12:52.525]  And if people want to send a letter to your Senator automatically, all they have to do is go to our website organicconsumers.org and click on there.
[02:12:53.588 --> 02:12:54.989]  Thousands of people are doing that right now.
[02:12:55.009 --> 02:13:05.738]  I don't think people realize, I've seen government produce promotions for the sewage companies going, how delicious the sewage in Hawaii is then sprayed on your crops.
[02:13:06.078 --> 02:13:06.879]  It's good!
[02:13:06.899 --> 02:13:11.082]  I mean, what is wrong with the stuff that's flushed down the toilet, folks?
[02:13:11.763 --> 02:13:12.643]  This is insane!
[02:13:12.663 --> 02:13:16.967]  Oh yeah, and when people hear that, for example, non-organic meat
[02:13:17.475 --> 02:13:29.879]  That it's legal in the United States to feed these cows and pigs and chickens slaughterhouse waste, blood, manure, the same things that have spread mad cow disease all over the world.
[02:13:29.959 --> 02:13:34.900]  That's when they start looking for traditional organic grass fed
[02:13:35.773 --> 02:13:37.514]  Beef and pork and poultry.
[02:13:38.735 --> 02:13:40.115]  You're some kind of extremist, sir.
[02:13:40.155 --> 02:13:44.037]  What's wrong with feeding rotten meat to a cow that isn't supposed to eat meat?
[02:13:44.237 --> 02:13:47.459]  You're one of those hippies that believe that cows should eat grass.
[02:13:48.419 --> 02:13:52.161]  And we are really getting extreme here, folks.
[02:13:52.201 --> 02:13:54.702]  It's interesting that about 54% of U.S.
[02:13:54.722 --> 02:13:59.465]  consumers are now saying that they're at least occasionally buying organic products.
[02:13:59.845 --> 02:14:04.527]  But that's why these big corporations like Kraft and Walmart
[02:14:05.034 --> 02:14:09.876]  And Schmuckers and Dean Foods are now stepping in to take over the organic industry.
[02:14:09.936 --> 02:14:13.858]  But at the same time, they're lobbying to just certify the organic when it isn't.
[02:14:14.518 --> 02:14:14.978]  That's right.
[02:14:16.099 --> 02:14:17.759]  These people make me so mad.
[02:14:17.799 --> 02:14:20.040]  You know, they don't just want to give us what we want.
[02:14:20.080 --> 02:14:21.101]  They claim it's a free market.
[02:14:21.401 --> 02:14:22.061]  It isn't, folks.
[02:14:22.081 --> 02:14:29.424]  They want to feed us this slop, chicken that's so dirty, full of everything, that they have to radiate it.
[02:14:31.475 --> 02:14:33.836]  This is unbelievable, Mr. Cummins.
[02:14:34.276 --> 02:14:43.801]  Yeah, our own Centers for Disease Control admit that, for example, there are 78 million cases of food poisoning every year in the United States.
[02:14:44.741 --> 02:14:47.902]  And that they're basically not going to do anything about it.
[02:14:47.982 --> 02:14:54.545]  They'll just start nuking the food, which causes it to produce carcinogenic chemicals.
[02:14:54.605 --> 02:14:56.366]  And then they'll let it even get dirtier.
[02:14:56.926 --> 02:14:57.467]  Exactly.
[02:14:57.787 --> 02:14:58.567]  Oh, wonderful.
[02:14:58.587 --> 02:14:59.628]  Folks, this is your life.
[02:14:59.668 --> 02:15:00.408]  Don't be so
[02:15:02.832 --> 02:15:03.893]  I'm talking to myself here.
[02:15:04.114 --> 02:15:05.355]  Stop eating the garbage.
[02:15:05.695 --> 02:15:08.398]  So what if your bill is 40% more?
[02:15:08.678 --> 02:15:15.845]  By buying organics, it will drive the prices down on organics and will force them... Look, we're hurting them right now.
[02:15:16.105 --> 02:15:18.888]  We're forcing them to put organics on the shelf, aren't we, Ronnie?
[02:15:19.028 --> 02:15:19.508]  That's it.
[02:15:19.688 --> 02:15:24.513]  That's the reason why they want to take control of that organic label, because they know that's what...
[02:15:24.853 --> 02:15:25.694]  That's what people want.
[02:15:25.774 --> 02:15:29.556]  People are going back to the traditional ways of eating.
[02:15:29.596 --> 02:15:30.116]  I'll tell you, though.
[02:15:30.156 --> 02:15:30.937]  You're extreme, sir.
[02:15:30.977 --> 02:15:35.339]  What's wrong with eating a dirty, with chicken feces all over the chicken?
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:37.381]  I mean, rotten meat.
[02:15:37.461 --> 02:15:38.861]  I mean, rotten meat is good.
[02:15:38.881 --> 02:15:41.583]  That's what they're trying to tell us.
[02:15:41.643 --> 02:15:42.804]  Look, rotten meat is good.
[02:15:42.904 --> 02:15:43.844]  Radiation is good.
[02:15:44.144 --> 02:15:45.926]  Cockroach genes in tomatoes is good.
[02:15:45.946 --> 02:15:48.767]  Hepatitis C and B all over the food.
[02:15:48.787 --> 02:15:51.989]  Pesticides, hormones, antibiotics.
[02:15:52.029 --> 02:15:52.609]  It's luscious.
[02:15:52.670 --> 02:15:53.190]  It's luscious.
[02:15:54.505 --> 02:15:56.866]  I mean, why not let the chemical companies do this?
[02:15:58.007 --> 02:15:58.647]  Exactly.
[02:15:59.147 --> 02:16:02.509]  Well, the interesting thing is that we can vote every day with our pocketbooks.
[02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:11.752]  And if we'll use our head and search out the alternatives, we can make our clout felt in the marketplace.
[02:16:12.373 --> 02:16:22.397]  But we've also got to get political now and stop the government from, for example, taking $95 billion of our tax money every year and giving it to these bureaucrats in the USDA
[02:16:22.935 --> 02:16:26.258]  Who turn around and subsidize chemical-intensive agriculture.
[02:16:26.278 --> 02:16:28.439]  Yeah, they've been engineers of the society.
[02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:29.580]  Exactly.
[02:16:30.381 --> 02:16:31.802]  Well listen, it's simple folks.
[02:16:32.322 --> 02:16:33.743]  Go to the farmer's market.
[02:16:33.843 --> 02:16:34.944]  Learn canning.
[02:16:35.304 --> 02:16:35.825]  It's fun.
[02:16:35.865 --> 02:16:36.745]  Your kids will love it.
[02:16:37.106 --> 02:16:41.289]  I mean, I go to the grocery store, but I also go to the farmer's market.
[02:16:41.469 --> 02:16:46.233]  That stuff is so cheap and so delicious and you're supporting the local farmers?
[02:16:46.533 --> 02:16:48.154]  Start a garden in your backyard.
[02:16:48.194 --> 02:16:50.616]  You won't believe how much food it produces.
[02:16:51.176 --> 02:16:51.756]  Exactly.
[02:16:51.796 --> 02:16:54.158]  And organic is not some modern, weird thing.
[02:16:54.198 --> 02:16:59.220]  This is the traditional way of doing things that our grandfather's generation took for granted.
[02:16:59.600 --> 02:17:02.962]  And we better quickly get back to those traditional ways.
[02:17:03.302 --> 02:17:05.123]  Plus, it doesn't deplete the resources.
[02:17:05.443 --> 02:17:05.984]  Exactly.
[02:17:06.424 --> 02:17:08.905]  Give us the website for your organization, please, sir.
[02:17:09.245 --> 02:17:13.207]  It's OrganicConsumers.org.
[02:17:13.468 --> 02:17:15.128]  OrganicConsumers.org.
[02:17:15.208 --> 02:17:19.411]  Ronnie Cummins, the founder and director of Organic Consumers Association of America.
[02:17:20.838 --> 02:17:26.122]  Are there any other key points you want to make, or is that basically it in a nutshell?
[02:17:26.282 --> 02:17:31.146]  I can give you the toll-free number for the Congressional Switchboard if people want to call their senators.
[02:17:31.386 --> 02:17:32.106]  Give us that number.
[02:17:32.447 --> 02:17:33.447]  It is 877-762-8762.
[02:17:33.648 --> 02:17:36.790]  Stay there, sir.
[02:17:37.731 --> 02:17:43.415]  I want to hear how close this legislation is to passing.
[02:17:43.435 --> 02:17:44.195]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.762 --> 02:17:46.222]  Currency devaluation.
[02:17:46.302 --> 02:17:46.562]  Inflation.
[02:17:46.622 --> 02:17:47.163]  One and the same.
[02:17:47.243 --> 02:17:51.986]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:05.652 --> 02:18:08.776]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:18:09.036 --> 02:18:10.879]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:18:11.119 --> 02:18:13.962]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:18:14.503 --> 02:18:16.726]  Here is reality.
[02:18:17.086 --> 02:18:20.671]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:18:21.147 --> 02:18:24.831]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:18:25.371 --> 02:18:29.135]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:18:29.555 --> 02:18:33.279]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.

[02:19:48.986 --> 02:19:58.248]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[02:19:59.169 --> 02:20:05.970]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[02:20:06.871 --> 02:20:08.311]  Is this what Americans want?
[02:20:08.531 --> 02:20:11.592]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[02:20:12.569 --> 02:20:21.092]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:46.101 --> 02:20:49.985]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:20:50.125 --> 02:20:53.208]  Now the alternative is drinking water, but not just any water.
[02:20:53.288 --> 02:20:57.512]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water, or EO, from RPA Biotech.
[02:20:57.572 --> 02:21:07.281]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[02:21:07.561 --> 02:21:13.188]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[02:21:13.368 --> 02:21:17.953]  Use topically to treat acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burned skin, rashes, and more.
[02:21:18.133 --> 02:21:22.078]  Use EO orally to treat sore throat, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.
[02:21:22.758 --> 02:21:23.919]  We're good to go.
[02:21:56.397 --> 02:21:59.159]  All right, Stuart in Texas has got a question for our guest.
[02:21:59.199 --> 02:21:59.939]  We'll go to him in a minute.
[02:21:59.959 --> 02:22:03.382]  And then we've got the Comcast Alabama, whatever that means.
[02:22:03.402 --> 02:22:04.762]  You guys come up with some weird names.
[02:22:05.223 --> 02:22:06.443]  Paul, Indiana, and others.
[02:22:06.483 --> 02:22:12.327]  And I'm going to get into a bunch of other news and other issues coming up in the next segment and then in the final segment.
[02:22:12.767 --> 02:22:21.453]  But we're talking to, of course, Ronnie Cummins, and he is the founder and director of Organic Consumers of America, Organic Consumers Association of America.
[02:22:22.946 --> 02:22:26.169]  Sir, how close are they to getting this passed?
[02:22:27.010 --> 02:22:29.412]  As we're talking right now, the U.S.
[02:22:29.452 --> 02:22:32.295]  Senate is debating this issue.
[02:22:32.735 --> 02:22:43.725]  So they're going to take a vote in the next few days, unless we can let them know that the public wants them to take their hands off organic standards.
[02:22:44.619 --> 02:22:46.581]  I think the only thing standing between us and a 21st century Nazi Germany is
[02:23:05.552 --> 02:23:09.295]  Getting organized and getting organized quickly, making our voices heard.
[02:23:09.475 --> 02:23:10.816]  Alright, 877-762-8762 is the switchboard number?
[02:23:10.916 --> 02:23:12.938]  Yeah, and ask them for your Senator's
[02:23:18.675 --> 02:23:22.497]  Tell them how dare you try to make it where we can't have real labels.
[02:23:22.897 --> 02:23:30.041]  Because right now there's these big organic organizations who set the standards and they go out and spot check and research.
[02:23:30.101 --> 02:23:35.964]  Now it's just going to be the FDA who's already tried to pass a law saying something totally engineered is organic.
[02:23:36.576 --> 02:23:37.757]  Yeah, we don't want the U.S.
[02:23:37.777 --> 02:23:43.902]  Department of Agriculture and the FDA and the EPA telling us what we can eat and telling us what can be on label.
[02:23:43.922 --> 02:23:47.244]  Well, this is the same government that tells us mercury is nutritious in vaccines.
[02:23:47.785 --> 02:23:48.305]  That's right.
[02:23:48.526 --> 02:23:50.527]  I mean, they actually say mercury is good for you folks.
[02:23:51.068 --> 02:23:55.671]  Let's go ahead and let Stewart in Texas get a comment or question in here for Mr. Cummins.
[02:23:55.691 --> 02:23:56.712]  Go ahead, Stewart.
[02:23:57.292 --> 02:23:57.713]  Okay, great.
[02:23:57.753 --> 02:23:59.074]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:23:59.274 --> 02:24:02.236]  If you've already touched on this, I apologize in advance, but
[02:24:04.028 --> 02:24:10.549]  People need to understand that when you change your dietary habits to go organic, you actually don't spend more.
[02:24:10.929 --> 02:24:18.211]  Because you eat less, you get more nutrition, and even your poop's not going to smell as bad.
[02:24:18.691 --> 02:24:21.891]  Thank you for saying that.
[02:24:21.931 --> 02:24:23.451]  That's very good for the radio, Stuart.
[02:24:23.832 --> 02:24:24.352]  I'm sorry.
[02:24:26.032 --> 02:24:28.872]  Well, you know, I mean, it's just all the benefits of it.
[02:24:34.198 --> 02:24:35.080]  Anything else, Stuart?
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:35.340]  That's it.
[02:24:35.380 --> 02:24:39.425]  I just want to remind people that you really don't spend money.
[02:24:39.665 --> 02:24:42.589]  If you're going to eat less, you're going to digest more, it's better for you.
[02:24:44.249 --> 02:24:47.710]  It's a trick to think you're actually going to be spending more, and that's really all I had to say.
[02:24:47.930 --> 02:24:52.011]  Well, thanks for the call, and what he's saying is true, I guess.
[02:24:52.051 --> 02:24:53.572]  But I know this, folks.
[02:24:53.892 --> 02:24:57.053]  When you hear the word organic, you think of something fancy, futuristic.
[02:24:57.113 --> 02:24:59.714]  Folks, you just should say real food.
[02:25:00.514 --> 02:25:02.255]  Tomatoes without cockroach genes.
[02:25:02.295 --> 02:25:03.555]  And folks, I'm not joking when I say that.
[02:25:05.089 --> 02:25:09.230]  Ronnie, do you want to tell folks before you leave us some of the genes they're putting in most of the foods now?
[02:25:09.810 --> 02:25:18.111]  Oh yeah, some of the most horrific experiments right now that genetic engineers are putting in with the approval of the USDA, I might say.
[02:25:18.671 --> 02:25:29.994]  They're putting human genes, for example, in corn and rice, saying they will produce these new super drugs that will be beneficial to our health.
[02:25:30.094 --> 02:25:32.134]  But they're not telling us, how are you going to keep this
[02:25:33.112 --> 02:25:34.053]  We're good to go.
[02:25:55.114 --> 02:25:56.215]  We're good to go!
[02:26:15.220 --> 02:26:17.302]  And this is the biggest story ever, Ronnie.
[02:26:17.582 --> 02:26:22.167]  I mean, I've had top geneticists who worked on this, who wrote the big reports on, who actually studied it.
[02:26:22.467 --> 02:26:30.395]  You change one gene, it's deadly poison, because it creates new amino acids your body treats as a poison.
[02:26:30.775 --> 02:26:37.081]  When they start adding four or five new animals into a tomato, this is deadly poison, folks!
[02:26:37.699 --> 02:26:46.306]  Yes, I mean, and that's why so many people are turning to traditional organic food, because it's banned to use genetic engineering.
[02:26:46.526 --> 02:26:53.472]  That's another reason so much, exactly, and God bless you for your work, Mr. Cummins, and people in your organization, because folks, this isn't a joke.
[02:26:53.692 --> 02:26:58.656]  Allergies that the studies are showing are exploding because of these genetically engineered foods.
[02:26:58.876 --> 02:27:00.077]  They're screwing us up.
[02:27:00.117 --> 02:27:05.602]  You eat, and people are getting violent allergic reactions to these and don't know why you're having such bad allergies.
[02:27:06.042 --> 02:27:12.205]  It's destroying the animals who are eating the genetically engineered feed, so what's it doing to us, the humans?
[02:27:12.245 --> 02:27:16.007]  Well, Ronnie, I talk to farmers all the time when they talk about Roundup Ready Canola and stuff.
[02:27:16.348 --> 02:27:18.429]  The pigs and the cows will not eat it.
[02:27:19.209 --> 02:27:19.409]  Yup.
[02:27:19.609 --> 02:27:22.191]  Now what are they smelling, Ronnie, that the humans can't smell?
[02:27:23.351 --> 02:27:27.914]  Indeed, we should listen to the animal world on this issue in our own common sense.
[02:27:27.974 --> 02:27:29.655]  Alright, God bless you for coming on, sir.
[02:27:29.675 --> 02:27:30.435]  Thanks a lot, Alec.
[02:27:30.475 --> 02:27:31.276]  Keep up the good work.
[02:27:31.336 --> 02:27:31.916]  Take care, bye.
[02:27:36.155 --> 02:27:39.137]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.078 --> 02:27:42.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:45.959 --> 02:28:47.560]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.700 --> 02:28:51.843]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.943 --> 02:28:54.825]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.905 --> 02:29:01.590]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.690 --> 02:29:01.750]  Yes.
[02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:04.794]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.014 --> 02:29:07.397]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.537 --> 02:29:17.568]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:29:17.868 --> 02:29:26.994]  M-T-B-E, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:29:27.154 --> 02:29:34.919]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:34.939 --> 02:29:35.379]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:29:45.549 --> 02:29:47.550]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[02:29:47.590 --> 02:29:50.472]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[02:29:50.672 --> 02:29:56.055]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[02:29:56.295 --> 02:29:57.816]  And what about those government agencies?
[02:29:57.856 --> 02:30:00.097]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[02:30:00.277 --> 02:30:03.839]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:30:04.159 --> 02:30:06.181]  And they can do it without due process.
[02:30:06.261 --> 02:30:13.167]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[02:30:13.368 --> 02:30:19.073]  Well, hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[02:30:19.353 --> 02:30:26.800]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property, or make it look like you own no property, and a whole lot more.
[02:30:26.860 --> 02:30:27.200]  We're good.
[02:30:48.549 --> 02:30:54.570]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:55.170 --> 02:30:58.131]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:00.991 --> 02:31:07.433]  Don't forget, if you live in any of the Gulf Coast areas, it's a bit procrastinating, and this new Category 4 hurricane's coming.
[02:31:08.013 --> 02:31:14.314]  If you order right now, they can still get it out to you in a two-day delivery, so you'll get it by Friday morning before the hurricane hits.
[02:31:15.023 --> 02:31:19.146]  Give New Millennium Concepts a call, but only in the next hour or so when you have time to do this.
[02:31:20.126 --> 02:31:22.088]  And that is 1-888-803-4438.
[02:31:23.889 --> 02:31:31.353]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to take advantage of that next day's shipping.
[02:31:31.714 --> 02:31:33.635]  It's normally about $50 for only $18.
[02:31:33.695 --> 02:31:40.279]  And get the regular discount on the water filters and get the free gift if you tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:31:42.000 --> 02:31:48.145]  It's 803-44-38 and folks that order until Alex Jones sends you get the best deals.
[02:31:49.867 --> 02:31:50.987]  So that is coming up.
[02:31:51.008 --> 02:31:56.712]  But again, if I can use a hurricane to get you to stop drinking the poison water they're giving you, c'est la vie, folks.
[02:31:57.233 --> 02:31:58.994]  I mean, that's why I drink out of water filters.
[02:31:59.735 --> 02:32:02.077]  I mean, the stuff in the water right now, you better worry.
[02:32:02.577 --> 02:32:06.180]  I mean, it's just as bad as the stuff in the GM food.
[02:32:07.481 --> 02:32:09.502]  Alright, I know we've got a load of phone lines and I'm going to get to you.
[02:32:09.522 --> 02:32:11.143]  We're going to get to you real fast here later.
[02:32:11.463 --> 02:32:13.424]  But I've got to cover some news here.
[02:32:14.985 --> 02:32:16.826]  If you missed that number, it's 888-803-4438.
[02:32:16.846 --> 02:32:20.488]  People say I say it so fast.
[02:32:20.548 --> 02:32:22.389]  Here it is.
[02:32:22.409 --> 02:32:24.130]  888-803-4438.
[02:32:26.091 --> 02:32:31.474]  Or go to Berkeywater.com and in the comment section, tell them what free gift you want.
[02:32:31.974 --> 02:32:35.696]  A sports bottle, water filter, or a shelter in place DVD or video.
[02:32:36.916 --> 02:32:39.237]  And tell them in the comment section Alex Jones sent you to get those.
[02:32:39.297 --> 02:32:42.478]  Berkeywater.com or there's a banner on InfoWars.com.
[02:32:43.779 --> 02:32:48.241]  Okay, I could spend all day on this, but Paul Watson put together a great article on it.
[02:32:48.301 --> 02:32:51.682]  British special forces caught carrying out staged terror attack in Iraq.
[02:32:52.242 --> 02:32:53.063]  Media blackout.
[02:32:54.643 --> 02:32:57.544]  Shadows why black op soldiers were arrested.
[02:32:58.845 --> 02:33:03.927]  And another example of how the Iraqi quagmire is deliberately designed to degenerate into
[02:33:04.725 --> 02:33:05.866]  A chaotic abyss.
[02:33:06.286 --> 02:33:17.110]  British SAS soldiers were caught attempting to stage a terror attack at the media and have dutifully shut up about the real questions surrounding the incident.
[02:33:17.992 --> 02:33:30.076]  What is admitted is that two British soldiers in Arab garb and headdresses, including beards, drove a car towards Irb of Iraqi police and began firing, according to the Basra governor, Mohammed al-Wali.
[02:33:30.556 --> 02:33:32.497]  A policeman was shot dead and another was injured.
[02:33:32.537 --> 02:33:36.718]  Pictured below are the wigs and clothing of the soldiers, as well as a photo.
[02:33:37.299 --> 02:33:40.140]  And it's on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com right now.
[02:33:40.580 --> 02:33:43.821]  The Arab garb is obviously undeniable proof that the operation
[02:33:44.562 --> 02:33:51.532]  Whether it's ultimate intention was staged so that any eyewitnesses would believe it had been carried out by Iraqis.
[02:33:53.755 --> 02:33:55.417]  And it continues.
[02:33:56.719 --> 02:33:58.742]  This has all the indications of a frame-up.
[02:34:00.433 --> 02:34:12.639]  This is made all the worse by, and more interesting, by the fact that early reports cited as originating from BBC World Service Radio stated that the car used contained explosives.
[02:34:13.120 --> 02:34:16.561]  Was this another staged car bombing intended to keep tensions high?
[02:34:17.262 --> 02:34:26.386]  As you will discover later, the plan to keep Iraq divided and in turmoil is an actual policy directive that spans back over two decades.
[02:34:26.406 --> 02:34:27.447]  This is all key, folks.
[02:34:28.047 --> 02:34:35.314]  The BBC reports that the car did contain assault rifles, a light machine gun, an anti-tank weapon, radio gear, and a medicine kit.
[02:34:35.734 --> 02:34:41.439]  This is thought to be standard kit for SAS operating in such a theater of operations.
[02:34:42.320 --> 02:34:49.427]  And are fake bushy black wigs and turbans standard kits for special air services?
[02:34:50.760 --> 02:34:53.241]  What happened to the early reports of explosives?
[02:34:53.322 --> 02:34:58.945]  Why is the media relentlessly reported on the subsequent rescue effort without describing why they had to rescue them?
[02:34:59.405 --> 02:35:02.267]  And the failed addresses these key questions.
[02:35:03.407 --> 02:35:09.911]  The soldiers were arrested and taken to a nearby jail where they were confronted and interrogated by Iraqi judges.
[02:35:10.518 --> 02:35:17.684]  The initial demand from the puppet authorities that the soldiers be relieved was rejected by the Basra government.
[02:35:18.605 --> 02:35:26.691]  At the point tanks were then sent in to rescue, in quotes, the terrorists and the liberated Iraqis started to riot.
[02:35:27.232 --> 02:35:39.462]  Firebombing and pelting stones at the vehicles, injuring British troops, as was depicted in this dramatic Reuters photo of the guy, the tanker, jumping off, burning.
[02:35:41.077 --> 02:35:45.682]  As the SAS were being rescued, 150 prisoners escaped from the jail.
[02:35:46.042 --> 02:35:50.106]  Was this intentional or just the result of another botched black-off?
[02:35:50.627 --> 02:35:57.694]  From this point on, the media coverage was monopolized by accounts of the rescue and the giant, marauding pink elephant in the living room.
[02:35:58.315 --> 02:36:03.680]  Namely, why were soldiers who were arrested in the first place was routinely ignored.
[02:36:04.730 --> 02:36:21.559]  The only outlet to ask any serious questions was the Australian TV News, which according to one viewer, gave credibility to the conspiracy theories that have long claimed that many terrorist attacks in Iraq were in fact being initiated and carried out by US, British and Israeli forces.
[02:36:21.819 --> 02:36:25.361]  Well, they've caught Israelis multiple times shooting at and shooting Marines.
[02:36:25.682 --> 02:36:31.025]  The Marines catch them and beat them up and pull the Arab disguises off and it's Israeli Special Forces.
[02:36:31.045 --> 02:36:32.345]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[02:36:32.625 --> 02:36:33.566]  We have a link right here.
[02:36:35.141 --> 02:36:37.904]  This will all be brushed over here.
[02:36:38.845 --> 02:36:53.598]  Iran's top military commander, Brigadier General Mohammad Bakr Zoldarkar, pointed the finger at the occupational government last week by publicly stating, the Americans blame weak and feeble groups in Iraq for insecurity in this country.
[02:36:54.839 --> 02:36:58.162]  We do not believe this and we have information that
[02:36:59.208 --> 02:37:04.755]  The insecurity is the roots in the activities of American and Israeli spies, he said.
[02:37:06.016 --> 02:37:10.782]  He continued by saying, Iraq is a deeply rooted phenomenon.
[02:37:10.822 --> 02:37:15.027]  The root of insecurity in Iraq lies in the occupation of the country by foreigners.
[02:37:15.567 --> 02:37:18.751]  If Iraq is to become secure, there will be no room for occupiers.
[02:37:20.476 --> 02:37:28.288]  And, uh, continues, that explanation has a lot of currency amongst ordinary Iraqis who have been direct witnesses to these bombings.
[02:37:28.328 --> 02:37:31.552]  I mean, they've watched helicopters fly over and fire a hellfire into a truck!
[02:37:32.494 --> 02:37:36.820]  Everybody sees it, there's thousands of witnesses, and everybody says, no, a car bomber did it!
[02:37:37.523 --> 02:37:42.265]  Again, if the war goes on for years, billions are made every few weeks, folks.
[02:37:42.745 --> 02:37:46.426]  If we go in and restore power and put a real government in, we'll have to leave.
[02:37:46.466 --> 02:37:47.286]  No cashola.
[02:37:47.487 --> 02:37:53.289]  No military launch base to attack Syria and Iran when the globalists detonate nukes here and blame it on Iran and Syria!
[02:37:53.669 --> 02:37:55.609]  You understand how important this article is?
[02:37:55.669 --> 02:37:56.470]  We got posted!
[02:37:57.310 --> 02:37:59.131]  You better get it out to everybody, folks!
[02:37:59.471 --> 02:38:02.692]  We got a chance to beat these people, but only if you take action!
[02:38:04.449 --> 02:38:13.957]  Throughout history we see the tactic of divide and conquer being used to enslave populations and swallow formerly sovereign countries by piecemeal.
[02:38:14.458 --> 02:38:30.312]  From the British stirring up aggression between different Indian tribes in order to foment division, to modern day Yugoslavia where the country was rejecting the IMF and World Bank takeover before the globalists broke it up and took the country piece by piece by arming and empowering extremists controlled by Bin Laden.
[02:38:31.264 --> 02:38:35.707]  And so in Iraq, New York Times, November 25, 2003, Leslie Glebe of the Council on Foreign Relations writes,
[02:38:43.470 --> 02:38:46.052]  Do the most quickly with the Kurds and Shiites.
[02:38:46.072 --> 02:38:51.535]  The United States could extradite most of its forces from the so-called Sunni Triangle north and west of Baghdad.
[02:38:51.575 --> 02:38:59.901]  American officials could then wait for the troublesome and domineering Sunnis without oil or oil reserves to moderate their ambitions or suffer the consequences.
[02:39:00.401 --> 02:39:05.564]  Ghalib argues for the following, a rebellion to escalate in order to create a divide in Iraq.
[02:39:06.185 --> 02:39:07.926]  Again, Ghalib openly argues for it.
[02:39:09.224 --> 02:39:20.229]  And in the 82, Odin Yian, an official from the Israeli Foreign Affairs Office wrote, who dissolved Iraq is even more important for us than dissolving Syria.
[02:39:20.669 --> 02:39:25.892]  In the short term, it's Iraq's power that constitutes the greatest threat to Israel.
[02:39:26.452 --> 02:39:30.494]  In the Iraq-Iran conflict, war torn Iraq apart
[02:39:32.506 --> 02:39:33.926]  And provoke its downfall.
[02:39:34.146 --> 02:39:42.108]  All manner of inter-Arab conflict help us to accelerate our goal of breaking up Iraq into small, diverse pieces.
[02:39:43.109 --> 02:39:52.351]  So if the plan is to keep the different sects in each other's throats, then who benefits from the chaos created by the endless bombings, Paul Watson comments.
[02:39:53.211 --> 02:39:53.751]  And that's true.
[02:39:53.811 --> 02:40:01.393]  I mean, we have the official Israeli plans, and then so they'll... Our government will bomb the Shiites, bomb the Sunnis, blame it on them, get a fight going.
[02:40:02.170 --> 02:40:14.319]  President Bush's slip of the tongue when he stated, I'll take time to restore chaos and order, I mean order out of chaos, but will seems less fractional in this light, Bush said.
[02:40:15.600 --> 02:40:18.001]  Plans for 4,000 NATO troops to replace U.S.
[02:40:18.021 --> 02:40:28.229]  troops in Afghanistan will likely be mirrored in Iraq and the country will be used as a launch pad for the coming invasions of Iran and Syria.
[02:40:28.669 --> 02:40:29.930]  It is certain that any groups
[02:40:31.474 --> 02:40:32.917]  I try to read fast and I'm not good at that.
[02:40:32.957 --> 02:40:33.458]  I apologize.
[02:40:33.478 --> 02:40:34.279]  Let me focus on this.
[02:40:34.580 --> 02:40:35.481]  This is important, folks.
[02:40:36.643 --> 02:40:44.618]  It is certain that any reports coming out of Iraq accusing occupational forces of being behind car bombings will be brutally censored.
[02:40:45.208 --> 02:40:57.536]  The Pentagon admitted before the war that independent journalists would be military targets and since then we have seen more journalists killed in Iraq over the last two and a half years in the entire seven-year stretch of U.S.
[02:40:57.576 --> 02:41:08.302]  involvement in Vietnam than we have, and Paul needs to add this, the whole P-2-O-G plan or the strategy of tension where the Pentagon said we're going to create crises to get more Arabs to fight us.
[02:41:09.643 --> 02:41:12.545]  In many cases, such as the Mazin and Danum,
[02:41:13.504 --> 02:41:16.426]  An acclaimed hero was killed after filming U.S.
[02:41:16.486 --> 02:41:17.166]  mass graves.
[02:41:17.226 --> 02:41:24.270]  Journalists are hunted down and executed because they have recorded something that the occupational government doesn't want to reach the wider world.
[02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:29.492]  In a few weeks, last week, we had troops telling reporters, I don't care if judges say you can tape stuff.
[02:41:29.532 --> 02:41:32.594]  If you do, we're going to kill you like we killed journalists in Iraq.
[02:41:33.514 --> 02:41:34.475]  Italian journalists
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:39.224]  Gillian Surgeon's car was fired upon.
[02:41:39.625 --> 02:41:49.118]  An Italian secret service agent was killed after Surgeon was told by the group that had kidnapped her that a threat to kill her if Italian troops didn't pull out of Iraq wasn't made by them.
[02:41:49.784 --> 02:42:08.012]  This means that Rumsfeld's Ministry of Truth in Iraq is putting out false statements by fake Jihad groups to try and maintain the facade that their resistance is run by brutal terrorists under the direction of Al-Qaeda, Iran, Syria, or whoever else they want to bomb next for Zalhokhari, who's openly a CIA.
[02:42:08.812 --> 02:42:15.895]  Every high-profile kidnapping brings with it eyewitness reports of white men in suits and police carrying out the abductions.
[02:42:17.702 --> 02:42:24.826]  Many will find it hard to believe that the ordinary soldiers would have it in them to carry out such brutal atrocities.
[02:42:25.206 --> 02:42:27.768]  The people carrying out these acts are not ordinary soldiers.
[02:42:27.788 --> 02:42:33.631]  They are SAS thugs who have been told that they will have to be more evil than the terrorists to defeat the terrorists.
[02:42:33.971 --> 02:42:37.593]  This is how they morally justify to themselves engaging in this criminal behavior.
[02:42:38.034 --> 02:42:40.295]  We will update this story as new developments take place.
[02:42:42.462 --> 02:42:47.706]  And I've got a huge report about satanic devil worship by Tony Blair and his degenerate wife.
[02:42:49.207 --> 02:43:00.375]  And no way to read that whole article of channeling Lucifer openly, black magic circles, Aztec satanic rituals, pentagrams, everything else.
[02:43:01.724 --> 02:43:05.766]  Running around foaming at the mouth saying I love getting bloodied in Iraq.
[02:43:06.366 --> 02:43:10.167]  Blair actually commenting in memos about being energized by the bloodying.
[02:43:10.447 --> 02:43:12.668]  I can feel the bloodying from the war.
[02:43:15.869 --> 02:43:18.110]  I mean that's who we're dealing with here ladies and gentlemen.
[02:43:18.610 --> 02:43:19.511]  I'm so sick of them.
[02:43:19.851 --> 02:43:20.912]  And then this continues.
[02:43:21.012 --> 02:43:24.035]  Experts say Louisiana levees should have held.
[02:43:24.375 --> 02:43:34.023]  Reuters reporting hurricane experts say Katrina's storm surges were similar to authorities have suggested that poor design, faulty construction, or a combination of the two were to blame.
[02:43:34.463 --> 02:43:36.525]  BoulderDash reports are they were blown.
[02:43:37.205 --> 02:43:38.126]  There's evidence of that.
[02:43:38.186 --> 02:43:39.627]  Not just Louis Farrakhan saying it.
[02:43:39.948 --> 02:43:42.730]  Indonesia fears bird flu epidemic.
[02:43:43.405 --> 02:43:46.306]  And it says that they think a baby died, a two-year-old.
[02:43:46.326 --> 02:43:46.906]  They think!
[02:43:47.226 --> 02:43:53.008]  Because the government says, give up all your rights, worship world government, or the evil bird flu will get you.
[02:43:53.028 --> 02:43:58.050]  Indonesia could soon face bird flu epidemic.
[02:43:58.931 --> 02:44:04.312]  The health minister has warned after the death of two young girls suspected of having the disease.
[02:44:04.613 --> 02:44:05.713]  It's suspected!
[02:44:07.512 --> 02:44:11.355]  If it's such a deadly airborne pathogen, why has it only killed like a dozen people?
[02:44:11.835 --> 02:44:15.218]  And again, it's going to be the globalists releasing something else and saying it's a spurred flu.
[02:44:15.438 --> 02:44:20.181]  The CFR says it will come here and it's going to kill us and millions are going to die.
[02:44:20.622 --> 02:44:21.702]  Some reports billions.
[02:44:21.762 --> 02:44:23.844]  And I say they're going to do it and all the evidence shows it.
[02:44:24.084 --> 02:44:26.146]  Why are they killing all these key microbiologists?
[02:44:26.166 --> 02:44:29.368]  There's people that can identify where the pathogen is really coming from.
[02:44:30.333 --> 02:44:37.177]  At least four people are known to have died from the bird flu in Indonesia alone, several others in a hospital with symptoms of the disease, say officials.
[02:44:37.677 --> 02:44:40.318]  I mean, flu kills 40,000 people a year in the U.S., folks.
[02:44:41.079 --> 02:44:45.081]  Indonesia is taking drastic steps to curb the virus amid reports of panic.
[02:44:45.881 --> 02:44:47.042]  Not yet an epidemic.
[02:44:47.482 --> 02:44:49.263]  And they just tell you to panic, so you panic.
[02:44:49.503 --> 02:44:50.864]  This is all ways to hurt you.
[02:44:51.244 --> 02:44:53.925]  And the government, even if it's real, can't protect you boys and girls.
[02:44:54.366 --> 02:44:55.686]  You better have a boogie point.
[02:44:55.706 --> 02:44:58.528]  You better have a place out in the country you can get to
[02:44:59.381 --> 02:45:04.666]  And hang a sign on the fence saying anybody comes in here, you're going to get lit up.
[02:45:06.468 --> 02:45:09.190]  But no, they tell you to sit in your house and learn to worship the government.
[02:45:10.191 --> 02:45:12.693]  And then out of that martial law system will never emerge.
[02:45:12.733 --> 02:45:14.735]  And then they'll have a national draft and we'll all be slaves.
[02:45:15.075 --> 02:45:17.337]  Oh, we've got to have a national draft to deal with the crisis, folks.
[02:45:17.878 --> 02:45:21.061]  Tesco stocks up on inside knowledge of shoppers' lives.
[02:45:21.601 --> 02:45:23.523]  Tesco stocks are way up.
[02:45:24.309 --> 02:45:45.611]  London Guardian, Tesco is quietly building a profile for you, along with every individual in the country, a map of personality, travel habits, shopping preferences, and even now, charities, and eco-friendly you are, a subsidiary of the supermarket chain, has set up a database called Crucible, and he just gets into how it works for the government, everything you do is totally tracked, no freedom, no nothing,
[02:45:46.806 --> 02:45:47.829]  It's already in America.
[02:45:47.909 --> 02:45:50.857]  Every prescription you get is instantly uploaded to the government.
[02:45:51.138 --> 02:45:53.043]  No Fourth Amendment, but you think you live in a free country.
[02:45:53.324 --> 02:45:53.925]  By the way...
[02:45:54.958 --> 02:46:00.022]  We defeated the tracker chips to tax you on every major road in Texas.
[02:46:00.362 --> 02:46:01.443]  6,000 miles of Texas roads.
[02:46:01.463 --> 02:46:04.585]  The entire country has 7,000 miles of taxable roads.
[02:46:05.366 --> 02:46:07.447]  We defeated the law, but they're not stopping.
[02:46:08.308 --> 02:46:13.432]  They're just going to, without even having a law, Taxodot has had millions of these printed up.
[02:46:13.492 --> 02:46:14.973]  I had the Business Wire press release.
[02:46:15.493 --> 02:46:18.436]  And they'll just order you with no law to put it on your car.
[02:46:18.856 --> 02:46:21.538]  Lawless scumbag worms.
[02:46:23.032 --> 02:46:24.453]  You see the new criminality.
[02:46:24.493 --> 02:46:26.953]  They don't even have the government pass the laws now.
[02:46:26.993 --> 02:46:30.235]  They just vomit this stuff onto you and say, do it!
[02:46:30.295 --> 02:46:32.556]  We got men with machine guns!
[02:46:34.176 --> 02:46:35.457]  You can tell I'm freaking out, folks.
[02:46:35.517 --> 02:46:37.437]  I have a giant stack here I haven't even covered.
[02:46:37.597 --> 02:46:41.659]  I am very angry about this because next year...
[02:46:45.891 --> 02:46:49.314]  They're going to start putting tolls up on the regular roads.
[02:46:49.635 --> 02:46:50.595]  Know what?
[02:46:50.616 --> 02:46:51.697]  99% of people don't want it.
[02:46:52.037 --> 02:46:54.459]  The polls a year ago were 93% in Austin.
[02:46:54.479 --> 02:46:54.459]  94%.
[02:46:54.499 --> 02:46:57.362]  98% in Houston.
[02:46:57.382 --> 02:46:58.663]  The new polls are 99%.
[02:46:59.564 --> 02:47:01.666]  And they won't even tell you how it's going to work.
[02:47:01.706 --> 02:47:02.387]  Well, I'll tell you.
[02:47:02.427 --> 02:47:03.307]  That's now official.
[02:47:03.387 --> 02:47:04.789]  Just in the industry publications.
[02:47:05.702 --> 02:47:27.414]  They are going to set up checkpoints, and they are going to pull you over, and they are going to give you one of these, and these computerized systems are going to block the roads, and they are going to make you right there at the toll road pay for a chip, that little sticker, that tracks you up to 2,000 yards, and there's nothing you can do.
[02:47:27.674 --> 02:47:29.535]  They will have machine guns.
[02:47:30.558 --> 02:47:31.939]  And there won't even be a law.
[02:47:32.019 --> 02:47:35.862]  I have the actual news article posted on Infowars.com.
[02:47:36.683 --> 02:47:39.185]  And we should run down the street screaming, pulling our hair out.
[02:47:39.225 --> 02:47:40.025]  This is that bad?
[02:47:40.245 --> 02:47:41.867]  There's not even a law!
[02:47:41.927 --> 02:47:44.468]  You are the scum, scum, scum of the earth!
[02:47:47.751 --> 02:47:48.952]  I'm trying to control myself right now.
[02:47:48.972 --> 02:47:52.094]  Hold on just a minute.
[02:47:52.154 --> 02:47:52.755]  Here's another one.
[02:47:53.235 --> 02:47:55.457]  China admits women are forced to have abortions.
[02:47:55.557 --> 02:47:59.760]  If one more State Department document says we're making this up, I don't know what I'm going to do.
[02:48:00.726 --> 02:48:02.588]  Neocons get on the radio and say it isn't true.
[02:48:03.168 --> 02:48:08.172]  But the Chinese government, London Independent Report, says of course we force women to have abortions.
[02:48:08.893 --> 02:48:13.197]  And our government gives them the awards and help funds and they come by and grab women and they slaughter babies.
[02:48:13.597 --> 02:48:15.118]  And the pro-abortion crowd just loves it.
[02:48:15.899 --> 02:48:17.921]  This is Charlie Manson activity, folks.
[02:48:17.961 --> 02:48:20.463]  I mean, this is one step closer to Sharon Tate murder.
[02:48:21.821 --> 02:48:25.385]  And, uh, I guess some horror like that only rates 15 seconds.
[02:48:25.845 --> 02:48:28.468]  Mental health bill to cost thousands to be detained immediately.
[02:48:28.488 --> 02:48:33.673]  The Scotsman reports over there, under their new freedom initiative, they're going to go ahead and arrest tens of thousands of people.
[02:48:34.433 --> 02:48:36.676]  And, uh, go ahead and start arresting you for no reason.
[02:48:38.257 --> 02:48:41.781]  And, uh, we'll take a few calls and cover a few final news stories when we get back.
[02:48:42.061 --> 02:48:43.562]  PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with me.
[02:48:46.957 --> 02:48:49.818]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.058 --> 02:48:51.638]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.979 --> 02:48:56.640]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:57.000 --> 02:49:01.422]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:01.842 --> 02:49:06.003]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:49:06.243 --> 02:49:09.106]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.186 --> 02:49:13.850]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.050 --> 02:49:18.455]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.695 --> 02:49:25.922]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.182 --> 02:49:28.604]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.764 --> 02:49:30.486]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:46.241 --> 02:49:51.466]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.606 --> 02:49:59.695]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.955 --> 02:50:07.002]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.182 --> 02:50:08.462]  Radioactive Poisoning.
[02:50:08.542 --> 02:50:14.443]  Potassium Iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.623 --> 02:50:19.704]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.824 --> 02:50:28.706]  Potassium Iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.966 --> 02:50:35.907]  Order the official Potassium Iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at

[02:50:43.988 --> 02:50:53.230]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.470 --> 02:50:55.711]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.911 --> 02:51:02.252]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:02.652 --> 02:51:03.253]  I think so.
[02:51:22.807 --> 02:51:23.087]  I think so.
[02:51:46.503 --> 02:51:49.204]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:49.224 --> 02:51:53.166]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.907 --> 02:52:03.611]  Look, I'm gonna have to do, kind of, caller graffitis, what some people call it, where I give you about 30-45 seconds or less.
[02:52:04.571 --> 02:52:05.812]  Or I'll never get to the callers.
[02:52:05.832 --> 02:52:07.212]  I want to hit a few final news stories.
[02:52:08.053 --> 02:52:10.614]  The Comcast in Alabama, then Paul and Patrick.
[02:52:10.874 --> 02:52:11.795]  Go ahead, Comcast.
[02:52:14.164 --> 02:52:18.247]  Yeah, I'm going to try to get the radio on your broadcast played in Alabama.
[02:52:18.827 --> 02:52:22.089]  If possible, I'm going to work on it real hard, and uh... Well, we've had affiliates there.
[02:52:22.169 --> 02:52:23.970]  I think we've got one right now, but we do need more.
[02:52:24.770 --> 02:52:25.991]  What channel is it, if you know it?
[02:52:26.331 --> 02:52:27.732]  I don't have all the affiliates in front of me.
[02:52:28.233 --> 02:52:28.613]  Oh, okay.
[02:52:29.073 --> 02:52:31.214]  Um... Uh, never mind then.
[02:52:31.374 --> 02:52:33.075]  Uh... What else is on your mind, my friend?
[02:52:33.095 --> 02:52:37.138]  Um, according to, um, just the way I think, okay?
[02:52:37.818 --> 02:52:42.201]  I say the end of the world is near, but that's just by the events that's been happening.
[02:52:43.177 --> 02:52:44.938]  Well, I appreciate your call.
[02:52:45.379 --> 02:52:46.980]  I don't think the end of the world is near.
[02:52:47.040 --> 02:52:49.842]  I mean, we've had Pompeii got covered with lava.
[02:52:50.542 --> 02:52:52.244]  I mean, stuff like this happens, folks.
[02:52:53.324 --> 02:52:57.047]  Let's talk to Paul in Indiana.
[02:52:57.067 --> 02:52:57.708]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:52:57.908 --> 02:52:58.889]  Hi, Alex.
[02:52:58.909 --> 02:53:00.370]  A couple quick points.
[02:53:01.310 --> 02:53:02.891]  I just heard that there's a
[02:53:05.018 --> 02:53:12.823]  The pharmaceutical companies are coming out with a new disease called ODD, and that's Obsessive Disobedience Disorder.
[02:53:13.364 --> 02:53:14.244]  They have a whole bunch.
[02:53:14.344 --> 02:53:19.608]  If you don't submit and give up all your rights, they have disorders where you refuse to take their psychotropics.
[02:53:19.868 --> 02:53:21.229]  Yep.
[02:53:21.249 --> 02:53:21.909]  That's the first thing.
[02:53:21.949 --> 02:53:32.556]  The second thing, back with the organic food and that whole issue, I know some people really can't afford to buy the organic food because it is a lot more expensive, but the main thing
[02:53:33.345 --> 02:53:40.470]  That they can do to protect themselves from the toxic, you know, food that's put out.
[02:53:40.750 --> 02:53:48.395]  Go get something from the health food store to detox your liver and protect your liver, because that is really what's critical.
[02:53:49.436 --> 02:53:50.137]  That's all I got, Alex.
[02:53:50.177 --> 02:53:51.337]  Alright, thanks for your call.
[02:53:51.537 --> 02:53:53.239]  You know, I really disagree with that statement.
[02:53:54.399 --> 02:54:02.305]  I've been around the country, and maybe in some areas it's expensive, but it tastes better, it's got more nutritional value,
[02:54:03.055 --> 02:54:07.996]  I mean, so one apple that's organic costs as much as two inorganic apples.
[02:54:08.116 --> 02:54:08.716]  So what?
[02:54:08.736 --> 02:54:12.017]  I mean, people say they can't afford that.
[02:54:12.137 --> 02:54:13.957]  You will get more nutrients.
[02:54:14.877 --> 02:54:17.938]  I mean, you know what you can do on a tiny plot of land?
[02:54:17.978 --> 02:54:20.538]  How much food you can grow on a quarter acre?
[02:54:21.799 --> 02:54:24.879]  You know what you... I mean, we've had so much food.
[02:54:25.619 --> 02:54:26.980]  Down here we have a long growth season.
[02:54:27.000 --> 02:54:27.960]  I mean, I've probably grown
[02:54:30.649 --> 02:54:32.331]  A hundred off of two plants.
[02:54:32.691 --> 02:54:33.471]  More than a hundred.
[02:54:33.832 --> 02:54:36.494]  Giant cucumbers.
[02:54:37.215 --> 02:54:40.037]  Probably off of three tomato plants.
[02:54:40.077 --> 02:54:44.941]  Probably 150 big juicy tomatoes.
[02:54:44.961 --> 02:54:47.003]  20 big fat eggplants.
[02:54:48.204 --> 02:54:49.204]  Hundreds of peppers.
[02:54:50.846 --> 02:54:54.228]  I mean, a lot of times it ends up rotting and I throw it back out in the air because we're eating so much of it.
[02:54:54.248 --> 02:54:58.452]  There's more than we need off of probably about a hundred square feet.
[02:55:00.335 --> 02:55:01.055]  100 square feet!
[02:55:02.176 --> 02:55:03.456]  Okay, let's talk to Patrick.
[02:55:03.496 --> 02:55:04.297]  Patrick, finish up.
[02:55:04.337 --> 02:55:04.677]  Go ahead.
[02:55:05.597 --> 02:55:06.758]  Yes, Alex.
[02:55:06.818 --> 02:55:07.298]  Good work.
[02:55:07.318 --> 02:55:12.400]  Yeah, you know, I go to these health food stores, these big health food grocery stores.
[02:55:12.420 --> 02:55:14.700]  You know, I've gone to two hours from here in Louisville.
[02:55:14.881 --> 02:55:15.021]  Yeah.
[02:55:16.365 --> 02:55:27.429]  You know, they're basically selling... a lot of the things they sell are the same things that they sell at Kroger's with these... You know, I don't trust these USDA organic labels.
[02:55:27.629 --> 02:55:29.230]  I mean, I just don't trust them.
[02:55:29.370 --> 02:55:33.011]  Well, you can tell organics by the look of them, and there are real certifications that are good.
[02:55:33.051 --> 02:55:33.651]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:33.791 --> 02:55:33.991]  Okay.
[02:55:34.171 --> 02:55:34.792]  We're out of time.
[02:55:34.832 --> 02:55:35.352]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:35.372 --> 02:55:36.952]  A bunch of news I wanted to get to.
[02:55:37.372 --> 02:55:38.413]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:55:38.433 --> 02:55:39.433]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:55:39.953 --> 02:55:41.554]  Central Standard Time.

[02:55:46.427 --> 02:55:47.448]  It's an important film.
[02:55:47.508 --> 02:55:48.428]  It needs to be seen.
[02:55:48.488 --> 02:55:49.509]  It needs to get attention.
[02:55:50.590 --> 02:55:51.510]  Please get Martial Law.
