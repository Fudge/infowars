[00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:06.392]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.032 --> 00:00:08.092]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.792 --> 00:00:09.893]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.553 --> 00:00:11.413]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:13.654]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.694 --> 00:00:17.635]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.875 --> 00:00:21.976]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:35.793 --> 00:00:37.675]  Well, it's Wednesday, my friends.
[00:00:37.715 --> 00:00:40.198]  Feels like Tuesday, though, that big three-day weekend.
[00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:42.575]  The 6th day of July 2005.
[00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:48.637]  Hard to believe that 2005 is already halfway behind us before we know it.
[00:00:48.677 --> 00:01:08.682]  It'll be 06 and unfortunately we'll probably wake up one morning to hear that someone's released smallpox or that a major city has had a suitcase nuke or dirty bomb detonate in it and that we should all worship our government and give up all of our liberties and freedoms because now the new age of the new world order is upon us.
[00:01:09.597 --> 00:01:15.760]  And that's what we're trying to stop here on this broadcast, Monday through Friday, from 11 a.m.
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.600]  until 2 p.m.
[00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.043]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:27.866]  Showing up every day, fighting the globalists toe-to-toe in the Infowar, and I'm your wartime broadcaster.
[00:01:28.928 --> 00:01:43.580]  Well, police and protesters have clashed as G8 leaders begin arriving in Scotland, and police have raided servers ahead of the G8 Summit trying to shut down dissent and indie media reporting, but it's not working.
[00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:56.750]  We have people on the scene beaming audio and video reports to servers, and then they're being posted on a myriad of alternative news sites like InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:01:58.012 --> 00:02:00.874]  So technology is definitely a two-edged sword.
[00:02:01.354 --> 00:02:03.535]  I mentioned it yesterday, but didn't detail it.
[00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:05.016]  Should have.
[00:02:05.437 --> 00:02:12.701]  Came out, of course, over the weekend on the McLaughlin Report, and now it's admitted, and it's come out in the grand jury.
[00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:16.063]  Karl Rove, we already knew this, is the leaker!
[00:02:17.555 --> 00:02:23.879]  And Yahoo, of all publications, has the headline, Carl Rove Worse Than Osama Bin Laden.
[00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:29.263]  Because Bin Laden doesn't sell out his own people, but Carl Rove does.
[00:02:29.963 --> 00:02:33.166]  And so we'll go over some of this article and dissect it.
[00:02:33.606 --> 00:02:34.967]  Plus, I haven't really talked about
[00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:40.407]  A large portion of the 9-11 whistleblowers together.
[00:02:40.467 --> 00:02:49.450]  We've interviewed them individually, but I haven't basically hailed and praised these champions of the truth.
[00:02:50.111 --> 00:02:51.773]  And these champions of courage.
[00:02:51.793 --> 00:03:00.600]  So I wanted to spend a few minutes in this first hour also going over some of the 9-11 whistleblowers, some of the prominent insiders and others out there.
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.508]  We also have a Democratic leader defending Bush to abolish the 22nd Amendment, barring presidential term limits.
[00:03:09.548 --> 00:03:14.612]  That is, barring a president from serving more than two consecutive four-year terms.
[00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:17.815]  He rebukes fears of Bush for life.
[00:03:18.467 --> 00:03:20.149]  Yes, how dare you!
[00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.753]  And in Venezuela, Chavez says FTAA is dead.
[00:03:25.773 --> 00:03:27.675]  This is out of United Press International.
[00:03:28.196 --> 00:03:31.598]  I want to look at some of the propaganda of Fox News.
[00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:35.202]  We have some interesting examples here as we expose the neocons.
[00:03:35.582 --> 00:03:37.544]  Another major scientific report out.
[00:03:37.664 --> 00:03:43.489]  TV has a negative impact on the very young children's learning abilities.
[00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:48.413]  China and Russia to hold joint military exercises August 18th to the 26th.
[00:03:48.753 --> 00:03:49.794]  There's a report on that.
[00:03:49.934 --> 00:03:50.915]  Very, very interesting.
[00:03:51.295 --> 00:03:53.857]  A lot of news on Big Brother today as well.
[00:03:55.238 --> 00:03:57.380]  And yesterday we didn't take very many calls.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.766]  We took a few calls with our first guest on the CAFTA passing the Senate.
[00:04:05.425 --> 00:04:09.308]  And how that would affect vitamins and over-the-counter supplements.
[00:04:09.848 --> 00:04:12.330]  We took a few calls with Joe Bannister in the third hour.
[00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:17.513]  The IRS agent, Treasury agent, that's now won his case in court with a jury trial.
[00:04:18.013 --> 00:04:23.036]  But we didn't have a lot of time to take calls yesterday, so today we're going to take a lot of your calls.
[00:04:23.237 --> 00:04:27.539]  Wide open phones for the next two hours and 55 minutes, 27 seconds.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.621]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:33.797 --> 00:04:34.097]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:34.197 --> 00:04:43.381]  You want to talk about Paul Harvey raising slavery, smallpox blankets, and nuking foreign countries?
[00:04:44.702 --> 00:04:47.823]  You want to talk about Alberto Gonzales for the Supreme Court?
[00:04:48.584 --> 00:04:50.465]  You want to talk about any of these issues?
[00:04:50.565 --> 00:04:52.025]  It's wide open phones.
[00:04:52.426 --> 00:04:55.807]  Masses of vital news and information straight ahead.
[00:04:55.827 --> 00:04:59.689]  Infowars.com and Infowars.net are the websites.
[00:05:02.364 --> 00:05:05.227]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.488 --> 00:05:07.049]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.095]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.415 --> 00:05:16.880]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.425]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.665 --> 00:05:24.506]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.586 --> 00:05:29.247]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.467 --> 00:05:33.889]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.109 --> 00:05:41.311]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.571 --> 00:05:43.991]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:10.012]  Berkey Water Filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:10.232 --> 00:06:21.516]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.716 --> 00:06:24.357]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:31.182]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.342 --> 00:06:33.223]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.423 --> 00:06:39.428]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.688 --> 00:06:45.352]  It's rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:56.441]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:56.461 --> 00:07:58.163]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.345 --> 00:08:20.826]  Alright, we're now into the second segment.
[00:08:20.846 --> 00:08:27.130]  8 minutes, 20 seconds in on the 6th day of July 2005 on this Wednesday.
[00:08:28.011 --> 00:08:29.372]  Wide open phones today.
[00:08:29.432 --> 00:08:37.377]  Jeffrey, Ron, Kurt, and many others that are patiently holding your calls are coming up in this segment.
[00:08:38.749 --> 00:08:41.270]  Let me just now go over some of the news.
[00:08:41.631 --> 00:08:58.320]  We're looking at the potential fall of Bush's brain, or the true president, Karl Rove, one of the high-level facilitators, or super gophers, as Kissinger and others are so aptly, properly named.
[00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:05.104]  But we shouldn't all be running around celebrating, popping the champagne, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:09:05.852 --> 00:09:10.477]  Because, again, I'm not an expert on this stuff, but I have studied it quite a bit.
[00:09:11.388 --> 00:09:12.648]  Well, actually, I am an expert.
[00:09:12.929 --> 00:09:14.829]  What I mean is, I'm not that smart.
[00:09:14.949 --> 00:09:18.010]  I just studied this stuff, so I understand what's going on.
[00:09:18.691 --> 00:09:32.796]  They could easily hang Bush out to dry as a sacrificial goat or scapegoat or sacrificial lamb to try to dissipate all the anger against the New World Order agenda and give the people a petty victory.
[00:09:33.196 --> 00:09:38.378]  Meanwhile, the entire globalist program and operation will just continue.
[00:09:39.272 --> 00:09:45.997]  We need to celebrate victories against tyranny, victories against the police state, victories against globalization.
[00:09:47.078 --> 00:10:05.932]  A victory was the EU expansion failing, and now many areas of the EU beginning to implode and gyrate out of control, leaving a trail of nuts and bolts behind it with its mammoth size still carrying its agenda forward.
[00:10:06.832 --> 00:10:08.174]  We should be celebrating that.
[00:10:08.234 --> 00:10:11.378]  We should be celebrating the FTAA.
[00:10:11.738 --> 00:10:17.846]  Free Trade Area of the Americas is in deep trouble, not here in the U.S., where we're totally enslaved, but in Latin America.
[00:10:19.511 --> 00:10:25.533]  We should be celebrating the fact that the truth about Ritalin causing heart attacks and brain shrinkage and cancer is coming out.
[00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:30.475]  We should celebrate the fact that people are waking up about mercury being deadly dangerous in the vaccines.
[00:10:31.116 --> 00:10:38.178]  Or the fact that serotonin reuptake inhibitors are causing massive suicides not just in children, but in adults.
[00:10:39.119 --> 00:10:44.781]  We should be celebrating the fact that we've gone in the last eight years from around 200,000 homeschoolers to now over 4 million
[00:10:48.297 --> 00:10:59.119]  We should be celebrating that the Minutemen are on the border, showing that the government has ordered the Border Patrol to stand down, and that the Border Patrol leaked the documents that they had been ordered to stand down.
[00:10:59.699 --> 00:11:10.521]  There are a thousand things we should be celebrating, but Karl Rove's imminent fall, and I'm not so sure that's going to happen, but people are saying it's imminent, is not one of them.
[00:11:12.182 --> 00:11:13.262]  It is not one of them.
[00:11:14.628 --> 00:11:16.310]  And so we'll get into that a little bit later.
[00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:18.231]  Again, I want him to fall.
[00:11:19.092 --> 00:11:21.935]  Fall now, and fall forever!
[00:11:23.316 --> 00:11:25.498]  All of you, straight to Hades!
[00:11:26.779 --> 00:11:28.741]  But I want all of you to fall!
[00:11:29.262 --> 00:11:31.904]  I want your agenda to fall, New World Order!
[00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:34.607]  All of you that serve the Dark Lord!
[00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:40.773]  So, we'll get into this sniveling article by Ted Roll.
[00:11:41.013 --> 00:11:46.937]  Karl Rove, worse than Osama Bin Laden, and it's full of poison.
[00:11:48.478 --> 00:11:52.960]  And I do want to get into the incredible whistleblowers.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.542]  And we haven't really talked about the whistleblowers together.
[00:11:55.742 --> 00:12:05.728]  We've interviewed them individually on this broadcast, but I want to talk about them all together, and how many 9-11 whistleblowers there now are, prominent people from inside the government.
[00:12:06.946 --> 00:12:08.687]  Prominent, respected names.
[00:12:09.288 --> 00:12:11.329]  I want to get into what's happening with the G8.
[00:12:11.389 --> 00:12:21.856]  I want to get into just incredible police state developments and the military to shift its main focus to domestic control and literal Stasi tattletale squads.
[00:12:23.297 --> 00:12:24.277]  There is so much.
[00:12:24.317 --> 00:12:32.983]  I want to talk about Alberto Gonzalez for the Attorney Generalship and Bush chastising us to keep our mouths shut and you evil conservatives, don't you criticize him.
[00:12:33.683 --> 00:12:35.686]  And the disinformation has now started.
[00:12:35.947 --> 00:12:38.911]  The drum being beat that you're a liberal if you're against Alberto.
[00:12:39.212 --> 00:12:40.073]  I want your guns.
[00:12:40.153 --> 00:12:40.914]  I'm for torture.
[00:12:41.195 --> 00:12:43.058]  I love Abortion Gonzales.
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.622]  It is all coming up.
[00:12:48.075 --> 00:12:51.436]  Before I get into all of that, let's just do things a little bit different today.
[00:12:51.456 --> 00:12:53.436]  Let's go ahead and go to calls.
[00:12:53.616 --> 00:12:55.776]  Jeffrey in Louisiana, welcome.
[00:12:56.256 --> 00:13:07.098]  Yes, I haven't called you so often because you've been telling a lot of great information, but I do have a comment after the Tropical Storm got through about Paul Harvey's little statement.
[00:13:07.838 --> 00:13:16.480]  The problem with Paul Harvey is that he forgets that the United States was retarded by some of those vicious attacks.
[00:13:17.122 --> 00:13:39.136]  Perhaps you don't realize that the genre in jazz known as the blues, for example, is the result of the atrocities committed by the Union Army in the South during the Civil War, which was remembered in the various moans and chants by the Negroes and whites of the South after the war and Reconstruction were over with, which caused the blues to get its name.
[00:13:39.577 --> 00:13:40.117]  No, you're right.
[00:13:40.157 --> 00:13:41.238]  That's admitted.
[00:13:41.258 --> 00:13:42.359]  That's where the blues comes from.
[00:13:42.859 --> 00:13:44.100]  And the whole point is
[00:13:44.927 --> 00:13:54.475]  That the United States does not have a good record in terms of its history in dealing with some of the minority groups, the Indians, etc.
[00:13:54.715 --> 00:14:00.740]  And it's a block that has come back to harm us in terms of what you see Paul Harvey talking about.
[00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:04.083]  For those that don't know, Jeffrey, recap.
[00:14:04.183 --> 00:14:05.304]  We played the clip yesterday.
[00:14:05.364 --> 00:14:07.425]  I might air it in the third hour today if folks missed it.
[00:14:07.446 --> 00:14:09.287]  A little two-minute clip.
[00:14:09.327 --> 00:14:11.589]  But for those that don't know, tell folks about Paul Harvey.
[00:14:12.239 --> 00:14:15.880]  Paul Harvey was a conservative commentator in the U.S.
[00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:17.180]  until 1967-68.
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:33.583]  His greatest commentary was describing how an Eskimo kills a wolf and using that story about putting a bloody knife so the wolf would literally kill itself by cutting its own tongue as an illustration of socialism and welfare.
[00:14:33.983 --> 00:14:41.965]  But after 1968, he changed and became an advocate of interdependence and became an advocate of the New World Order.
[00:14:42.905 --> 00:14:49.275]  And has gradually lost influence in this country because he's not carrying on as many radio stations as he once was.
[00:14:50.216 --> 00:14:54.723]  Now his, Paul Harvey, as I say, his big problem is that he still
[00:14:55.430 --> 00:15:05.102]  Well, for people that don't know though, recap what he said in a commentary a week and a half ago.
[00:15:13.553 --> 00:15:16.496]  Giving Indian smallpox filled blankets.
[00:15:16.516 --> 00:15:17.377]  And that's not true.
[00:15:17.477 --> 00:15:21.281]  You know, I mean, they did give it to them, but that is not what conquered this land.
[00:15:21.301 --> 00:15:22.662]  No, it's not.
[00:15:22.702 --> 00:15:23.803]  How dare him!
[00:15:23.883 --> 00:15:27.987]  How dare him say something evil like that is why we conquered this land.
[00:15:28.047 --> 00:15:28.428]  That's right.
[00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:32.311]  And also the idea that we used the backs of slaves to do all that kind of work.
[00:15:32.331 --> 00:15:37.156]  It was because we were free market and people could get away from big government and had a chance to really
[00:15:38.596 --> 00:15:39.377]  Absolutely right.
[00:15:39.397 --> 00:15:44.198]  The pioneers of this country were really working for more elbow rooms so they could develop their own dreams by themselves.
[00:15:44.218 --> 00:15:49.500]  And they were predominantly straight and upright and incredible trailblazers.
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:57.562]  And again, how dare him take the worst chapters like black slavery, which a lot of economic studies show did not even help this country.
[00:15:57.842 --> 00:15:58.343]  That's right.
[00:15:58.403 --> 00:16:06.265]  How dare him do that, especially given, in terms of New Orleans, the fact that they were a class of free coloreds from whom came
[00:16:06.761 --> 00:16:10.886]  Some of our great musicians including Louie Morrow, Gottschalk, Louie Armstrong, etc.
[00:16:10.926 --> 00:16:11.407]  later on.
[00:16:12.139 --> 00:16:22.947]  And the point is that Paul Harvey's claim that we have to be tough and so on and so forth disregards the fact that the rights to life, liberty, property, and pursuit of happiness are the basis of America.
[00:16:22.967 --> 00:16:24.308]  Well, it's not being tough.
[00:16:24.428 --> 00:16:26.209]  It's not being tough torturing people.
[00:16:26.289 --> 00:16:28.290]  It's not being tough nuking innocent countries.
[00:16:28.551 --> 00:16:34.475]  It's not being tough having black slaves with a chain around their neck and beating them upside the head with a poleaxe.
[00:16:34.615 --> 00:16:36.877]  None of that is tough.
[00:16:37.137 --> 00:16:39.298]  That is abusive and evil and sick.
[00:16:39.358 --> 00:16:39.839]  Thanks for the call.
[00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:40.419]  Absolutely.
[00:16:40.439 --> 00:16:41.660]  Thanks for the call, Jeffrey.
[00:16:42.572 --> 00:16:44.214]  And it was disgusting, folks.
[00:16:44.774 --> 00:16:44.834]  Ron?
[00:16:44.854 --> 00:16:46.897]  Ron, where are you calling us from?
[00:16:46.917 --> 00:16:48.198]  I'm from Maryland.
[00:16:48.698 --> 00:16:49.259]  Welcome, sir.
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.380]  Yeah.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.742]  How are you?
[00:16:53.063 --> 00:16:53.203]  Good.
[00:16:53.243 --> 00:16:54.544]  Your phone's really distorting, sir.
[00:16:55.025 --> 00:16:56.026]  I'm sorry if it goes out.
[00:16:56.046 --> 00:17:05.656]  Just really quick, on CNN over the weekend, I saw a piece in Montgomery County, Maryland, where they're having quote-unquote civilians with, or volunteers with radios
[00:17:06.092 --> 00:17:10.314]  Directly to the police, and they sit outside of bars and liquor stores to look for drunk drivers.
[00:17:10.354 --> 00:17:14.537]  And again, today it's for drunks, tomorrow it's for gun owners, and it's even started.
[00:17:14.797 --> 00:17:17.699]  The Stasi situation is beginning.
[00:17:18.439 --> 00:17:19.140]  Yeah, it's on.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.981]  They've got about almost a ten minute piece on it.
[00:17:22.782 --> 00:17:24.983]  Well, I wish somebody'd send me a news article about that.
[00:17:25.003 --> 00:17:25.503]  I'd post it.
[00:17:25.523 --> 00:17:26.904]  I've seen a lot of those, though.
[00:17:26.984 --> 00:17:30.726]  They've got it cased out in the car with these two older women.
[00:17:33.108 --> 00:17:33.908]  I'm sorry, sir.
[00:17:33.968 --> 00:17:35.289]  Your cell phone's just gone.
[00:17:36.241 --> 00:17:37.501]  Who's up next here in line?
[00:17:39.042 --> 00:17:41.182]  Kurt in Pennsylvania, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:17:43.582 --> 00:17:45.903]  Welcome Kurt, you're on the air, worldwide.
[00:17:46.423 --> 00:17:47.543]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:17:48.263 --> 00:17:50.784]  I didn't know if you knew this or not, I'll be shocked if you didn't.
[00:17:52.544 --> 00:17:56.305]  Paul Harvey also should be ashamed because he's a Southern Baptist minister.
[00:17:56.325 --> 00:17:57.805]  I didn't know if you knew that.
[00:17:58.145 --> 00:17:59.165]  I didn't know that, no.
[00:18:00.465 --> 00:18:03.466]  I was wondering if you could run down real quick
[00:18:04.256 --> 00:18:07.178]  Uh, your thoughts on Sandra Day O'Connor's resignation?
[00:18:07.819 --> 00:18:16.684]  And also, uh, this is on 9-11, a little off the subject today, but... There aren't, there isn't, it's just freedom, sir, any issue you want to talk about.
[00:18:16.865 --> 00:18:17.505]  Okay, you got it.
[00:18:18.326 --> 00:18:28.452]  Uh, last night I went home, and my son's finally taken an interest in 9-1-1, and he's getting the website, but he came up with some, uh, video.
[00:18:29.573 --> 00:18:33.376]  Uh, there's no date on it, and he's looking into it today when he gets home from work.
[00:18:34.241 --> 00:18:35.542]  It's of a helicopter.
[00:18:36.663 --> 00:18:38.544]  There's two people inside at least.
[00:18:39.044 --> 00:18:43.608]  It shows a woman on the left with a digital camera.
[00:18:44.789 --> 00:18:47.050]  The other person is running a video camera.
[00:18:48.731 --> 00:18:53.074]  And they're obviously in a helicopter and they're going by the World Trade Center.
[00:18:53.174 --> 00:18:55.476]  There's no date of when this film was made.
[00:18:55.656 --> 00:18:56.897]  Okay.
[00:18:57.858 --> 00:19:03.662]  Next to, I'd say it's the upper quarter of the World Trade Center, one of the buildings.
[00:19:04.445 --> 00:19:10.630]  There's an object, which is rather flat, you really can't make out the detail too well.
[00:19:10.670 --> 00:19:11.591]  Okay, what is it?
[00:19:12.792 --> 00:19:16.975]  And it speeds away and leaves like a jet trail.
[00:19:17.976 --> 00:19:21.919]  And this is on the internet, and I'd be glad to get to the website.
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.602]  Yeah, just email it to tips at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:25.763 --> 00:19:29.245]  Okay, InfoWars... Tips at InfoWars.com.
[00:19:29.586 --> 00:19:29.846]  Tim?
[00:19:30.546 --> 00:19:30.927]  Tips.
[00:19:31.167 --> 00:19:31.547]  Tips.
[00:19:31.727 --> 00:19:32.348]  Okay, tips.
[00:19:33.659 --> 00:19:41.506]  Yeah, I didn't know if you knew anything about it, and I wondered if, you know, I just wanted to make you aware of it, and I just thought maybe you knew something about it.
[00:19:41.786 --> 00:19:43.267]  No, I don't, but that sounds interesting.
[00:19:43.307 --> 00:19:43.868]  Thank you, sir.
[00:19:44.568 --> 00:19:46.770]  Thank you, Kurt, and thank you for you and your son listening.
[00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:50.774]  God bless you, and getting involved in 9-11, and getting involved in researching it.
[00:19:51.975 --> 00:19:53.596]  All right, folks, we'll come right back.
[00:19:53.656 --> 00:19:59.662]  We'll continue with phone calls, and then at the bottom of the hour, I will plunge back into news and back into your calls.
[00:19:59.682 --> 00:20:00.102]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.666 --> 00:20:05.567]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:18.072]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:20:18.492 --> 00:20:18.892]  The U.S.
[00:20:18.932 --> 00:20:24.514]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:20:24.914 --> 00:20:27.114]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:20:28.975 --> 00:20:30.056]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[00:20:30.076 --> 00:20:32.937]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[00:20:33.037 --> 00:20:39.080]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.842]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[00:20:42.922 --> 00:20:49.265]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[00:20:49.825 --> 00:20:53.829]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:20:53.949 --> 00:20:54.230]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:54.530]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:01.343 --> 00:21:02.123]  Terrorism!
[00:21:02.263 --> 00:21:03.024]  Terrorism!
[00:21:03.124 --> 00:21:09.206]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:21:09.446 --> 00:21:11.027]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:13.768]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:21:14.148 --> 00:21:28.714]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:28.754 --> 00:21:29.074]  government.
[00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:31.055]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:21:31.415 --> 00:21:37.337]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:37.478 --> 00:21:41.979]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.
[00:21:42.219 --> 00:21:47.622]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:47.722 --> 00:21:48.942]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:49.002 --> 00:21:49.582]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:21:49.602 --> 00:21:51.643]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:22:01.239 --> 00:22:03.721]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:04.481 --> 00:22:07.162]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:22:07.883 --> 00:22:24.031]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny.
[00:22:24.992 --> 00:22:30.195]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[00:22:31.008 --> 00:22:38.930]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:40.510]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:40.791]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:22:40.851 --> 00:22:42.251]  The call is free.
[00:22:42.271 --> 00:22:46.612]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:01.135 --> 00:23:08.041]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:23:08.562 --> 00:23:13.987]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:23:14.387 --> 00:23:24.417]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:23:24.557 --> 00:23:26.919]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:23:27.259 --> 00:23:30.340]  I used to have yellow nails and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:23:30.441 --> 00:23:31.961]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:23:32.081 --> 00:23:34.963]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[00:23:35.243 --> 00:23:39.565]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:23:39.825 --> 00:23:41.545]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[00:23:41.906 --> 00:23:53.571]  You'll find Non-X Gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[00:23:54.151 --> 00:23:55.352]  Non-X Nail Gel!
[00:23:55.592 --> 00:23:58.515]  For clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals!
[00:24:09.303 --> 00:24:17.570]  I normally play interesting audio clips here on the broadcast, but we had like three of them stack up that I didn't get to last week.
[00:24:18.422 --> 00:24:22.606]  So I want to play those coming up throughout the next two and a half hours we've got left.
[00:24:23.006 --> 00:24:26.790]  It's 24 minutes and 25 seconds into this first hour.
[00:24:27.971 --> 00:24:32.315]  One of them is the Daily Show, a really funny piece about the manipulation of reality.
[00:24:33.296 --> 00:24:34.357]  And then we're going to play a clip.
[00:24:35.134 --> 00:24:51.930]  I remember about a week and a half ago, Mr. Scientologist, and by the way, I don't agree with Scientology folks, but I do agree with the stance they have against drugging of the children, and they've been savagely attacking Tom Cruise for his views against drugging, especially since this interview.
[00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:55.833]  And I just want to ask people, you know, he's not very rude in this interview.
[00:24:55.893 --> 00:24:59.897]  I don't get why he's being attacked.
[00:24:59.917 --> 00:25:00.918]  He was on with Matt Lauer.
[00:25:01.488 --> 00:25:04.490]  And the other clip isn't as powerful without the video.
[00:25:04.530 --> 00:25:15.158]  The video's on PrisonPlanet.com, but it's a little video montage put together about the lies and propaganda and the control of the left and the right by the globalists.
[00:25:15.799 --> 00:25:23.685]  And I was honored to see that the folks who put this video montage, this little music video together, they used some clips out of a few of my films
[00:25:24.628 --> 00:25:33.795]  And so we'll be playing that as well, and probably re-airing the two-minute Paul Harvey piece to analyze that further in a documentary format.
[00:25:35.136 --> 00:25:36.678]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[00:25:36.718 --> 00:25:38.239]  Let's talk to Lisa in Texas.
[00:25:38.299 --> 00:25:39.099]  Lisa, go ahead.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:40.320]  Hi, Alex.
[00:25:40.641 --> 00:25:40.881]  Hi.
[00:25:42.302 --> 00:25:43.183]  I had a question.
[00:25:43.223 --> 00:25:44.384]  It's real important.
[00:25:44.444 --> 00:25:48.427]  It's in regards to PCASTA and the Codex Alimentarius.
[00:25:48.847 --> 00:25:53.811]  You're talking about the different legislation they're trying to pass right now.
[00:25:54.634 --> 00:25:54.934]  Right.
[00:25:55.214 --> 00:25:57.475]  Central American Free Trade Agreement and then, yeah.
[00:25:57.995 --> 00:26:01.577]  Yeah, the Section 6, I was really concerned about.
[00:26:01.597 --> 00:26:07.439]  Of course, all of it concerns me, but particularly the Section 6 that regards U.S.
[00:26:07.479 --> 00:26:08.340]  complying with Codex
[00:26:09.045 --> 00:26:11.506]  Guidelines for vitamins, minerals, and food supplements?
[00:26:11.526 --> 00:26:13.366]  Yes, we had a guest on yesterday about that.
[00:26:13.826 --> 00:26:23.388]  Right, so what I did is I got a hold of all my friends and relatives that I thought would be interested in writing their congressman.
[00:26:23.468 --> 00:26:30.589]  And again, for those that don't know, under international treaty they will start regulating and restricting our access to vitamins.
[00:26:31.390 --> 00:26:37.871]  Right, and so I need some help because I don't quite understand
[00:26:38.527 --> 00:26:44.653]  I got an email back from a friend, and she sent me a website called Snopes.
[00:26:45.694 --> 00:26:46.534]  Are you familiar with them?
[00:26:48.676 --> 00:26:49.337]  No, not, no.
[00:26:50.218 --> 00:26:52.239]  Okay, they debunk urban legends.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:54.081]  Oh, that's what I thought, but I didn't want to say.
[00:26:54.101 --> 00:27:03.890]  They say publicly admitted things are urban legends, like government prior knowledge of 9-11, which is now publicly admitted, is an urban legend.
[00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:04.991]  Everything's an urban legend.
[00:27:06.053 --> 00:27:12.702]  Right, and I just needed some assistance in how to converse with this individual.
[00:27:13.042 --> 00:27:16.106]  What I did say is that... You know, I'd just move on.
[00:27:16.126 --> 00:27:17.948]  If they want to believe that, that's fine.
[00:27:18.429 --> 00:27:21.833]  We've got to get to the people that want to check out the information for themselves.
[00:27:21.893 --> 00:27:23.816]  I mean, pearls before swine.
[00:27:24.878 --> 00:27:32.299]  If people want to live in total denial, if they want to believe popular mechanics that supposedly debunk the 9-11 conspiracies, then go ahead!
[00:27:32.339 --> 00:27:33.560]  The whole thing's a fraud!
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:40.021]  The Homeland Security Director's cousin wrote the piece, put it together.
[00:27:40.521 --> 00:27:43.041]  I mean, do people want to believe the urban legend, folks?
[00:27:43.361 --> 00:27:49.702]  Look, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld got up on Face the Nation and said it's an urban legend.
[00:27:50.043 --> 00:27:51.863]  I never said that Saddam had WMDs!
[00:27:53.809 --> 00:27:56.250]  Well, and I, I... So, I mean, how am I supposed to respond?
[00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:57.390]  Everything's an urban legend.
[00:27:57.410 --> 00:27:58.931]  Look, look.
[00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:07.695]  National talk show host Sean Hannity on Fox News said that PNAC is a conspiracy theory, basically an urban legend.
[00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:09.555]  Okay, PNAC is real.
[00:28:09.835 --> 00:28:10.956]  Dick Cheney published it.
[00:28:11.536 --> 00:28:20.040]  It's their official website of the 25 top neocons and Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, I've heard them all say it doesn't exist.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.401]  So, you know, I can't respond to that type of willful lying.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:26.761]  It's just, you know, there's nothing I can do.
[00:28:27.441 --> 00:28:34.806]  Look, these same websites say that the World Trade Organization isn't taking our sovereignty.
[00:28:34.866 --> 00:28:41.590]  Well, everyone knows the WTO is an unelected body set up in the mid-90s, and that it is regulating our trade.
[00:28:42.111 --> 00:28:44.072]  Everybody knows we're going into globalization.
[00:28:44.112 --> 00:28:45.693]  Everybody knows they're getting rid of the borders.
[00:28:45.973 --> 00:28:50.496]  The big Canadian paper, send your family for the Globe and Mail and the Toronto Star,
[00:28:51.704 --> 00:29:01.948]  Last week, where an entire party, one of the biggest parties in their parliament, went public and, you know, the headline says, loss of Canadian sovereignty.
[00:29:02.759 --> 00:29:10.381]  Okay, everybody knows that the Codex Alimentarius, this international UN ruling, wants to regulate vitamins.
[00:29:10.441 --> 00:29:12.742]  We know the government's been trying to regulate vitamins.
[00:29:12.942 --> 00:29:15.343]  We know in 1993 they tried.
[00:29:15.763 --> 00:29:17.003]  We had to get a law passed in 1994.
[00:29:17.243 --> 00:29:20.665]  You know, this is an enemy tactic, Lisa.
[00:29:20.705 --> 00:29:25.306]  It's like when they were ramming tanks into the Waco church, they were saying, this is not an assault.
[00:29:26.281 --> 00:29:28.483]  I can't help these people.
[00:29:28.784 --> 00:29:30.225]  And you're right.
[00:29:30.345 --> 00:29:32.367]  Thank you for giving me perspective on that.
[00:29:32.647 --> 00:29:38.653]  Yeah, if you've given them the evidence in the subsection and they're saying it's an urban legend, just move on.
[00:29:39.334 --> 00:29:39.574]  Okay.
[00:29:39.834 --> 00:29:40.275]  Okay, dear.
[00:29:40.395 --> 00:29:40.975]  God bless you.
[00:29:41.256 --> 00:29:41.776]  Anything else?
[00:29:42.877 --> 00:29:49.404]  Just that I'm glad to hear that you have the same opinion of the Tom Cruise that I did.
[00:29:49.584 --> 00:29:50.184]  Good, good.
[00:29:50.225 --> 00:29:50.585]  We'll be back.
[00:29:51.899 --> 00:29:54.909]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.832 --> 00:29:58.501]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.436 --> 00:30:07.938]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:09.179]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:10.159]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:13.120]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:18.202]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:30:18.422 --> 00:30:19.542]  Check out this new product.
[00:30:19.662 --> 00:30:20.803]  It's called No B.O.
[00:30:20.863 --> 00:30:22.603]  and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:30:22.924 --> 00:30:25.004]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No B.O.
[00:30:25.044 --> 00:30:26.645]  to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[00:30:26.785 --> 00:30:26.965]  Look.
[00:30:27.145 --> 00:30:29.468]  The creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[00:30:29.548 --> 00:30:34.373]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:30:34.653 --> 00:30:37.776]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[00:30:37.896 --> 00:30:43.322]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:30:43.402 --> 00:30:44.163]  Try No-B-O.
[00:30:44.283 --> 00:30:45.264]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:30:46.425 --> 00:30:49.328]  No-BO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[00:30:49.508 --> 00:30:52.391]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-BO.
[00:30:52.571 --> 00:30:55.013]  Check out their website at No-BO.com.
[00:30:55.193 --> 00:30:58.476]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-BO.
[00:30:58.676 --> 00:30:59.397]  That's No-BO.com.
[00:31:01.565 --> 00:31:04.586]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:04.886 --> 00:31:09.808]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:10.068 --> 00:31:14.429]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.730 --> 00:31:23.633]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.833 --> 00:31:27.454]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.754 --> 00:31:32.780]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:39.828]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.308 --> 00:31:40.849]  What about you?
[00:31:41.605 --> 00:31:46.947]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[00:31:47.007 --> 00:31:48.087]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:48.167 --> 00:31:50.068]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.091 --> 00:32:03.654]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:32:03.714 --> 00:32:07.298]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:32:07.398 --> 00:32:07.779]  Shocking?
[00:32:07.879 --> 00:32:08.359]  Of course!
[00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.682]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:32:10.822 --> 00:32:13.745]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:32:13.926 --> 00:32:15.287]  Forewarned is forearmed.
[00:32:15.447 --> 00:32:19.712]  Order your copy of the book Secret Assassins of Food by Dr. Ott, PhD.
[00:32:19.892 --> 00:32:21.294]  Only through Mother Earth Minerals.
[00:32:21.614 --> 00:32:26.696]  This 150 plus page milestone gives you more for your money than any other piece of work on the subject.
[00:32:26.816 --> 00:32:39.740]  It should be mandatory in every university that teaches anything about improving your nutrition without all the potions and lotions that are sold to mask over all the problems most folks taught with resulting from the horrible things that are taught as being so good for us.
[00:32:39.881 --> 00:32:43.962]  Also, you will learn about the three foods to avoid at all costs by ordering the book
[00:32:44.002 --> 00:32:47.705]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:13.414 --> 00:33:16.918]  All across the board, our basic freedoms are being dismantled.
[00:33:16.938 --> 00:33:19.020]  A high-tech police state's being set up.
[00:33:20.641 --> 00:33:23.904]  Washington Post headline, military expands homeland efforts.
[00:33:23.964 --> 00:33:26.187]  Pentagon to share data with civilian agencies.
[00:33:26.747 --> 00:33:28.048]  Merging the military and police.
[00:33:28.108 --> 00:33:31.652]  New York Times, Pentagon directs attention to domestic warfare.
[00:33:33.093 --> 00:33:33.954]  Very serious.
[00:33:34.275 --> 00:33:37.618]  Bush administration annexes the internet out of the register.
[00:33:38.439 --> 00:33:39.339]  Forget cameras.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:42.301]  Spy devices will cut drivers speed by satellite.
[00:33:42.781 --> 00:33:43.762]  That's out of the times.
[00:33:44.622 --> 00:33:46.603]  Oil will hit $100 by winter.
[00:33:46.663 --> 00:33:48.004]  This is out of the Observer.
[00:33:48.024 --> 00:33:49.404]  $100 a barrel.
[00:33:50.485 --> 00:33:52.266]  Good news we never got to last week.
[00:33:52.646 --> 00:33:54.107]  Americans buying more guns.
[00:33:54.187 --> 00:33:56.027]  Sales up 11% this year from last year.
[00:33:58.127 --> 00:33:58.867]  That's just some of it.
[00:33:58.887 --> 00:34:13.751]  I want to get into the impending, some are saying, fall of Karl Rove, Bush's brain, because he's directly now admitted the leaker, which we already knew, but now it's mainstream, exposing the CIA controller in Europe.
[00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:16.932]  So, we're going to get into all of it.
[00:34:16.992 --> 00:34:19.192]  Alberto Gonzales is just everything.
[00:34:20.093 --> 00:34:21.373]  The Supreme Court, you name it.
[00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:28.894]  And of course Minnow and Robert and Roger and Scott and Micah in Myrtle Beach, California and everybody else!
[00:34:30.155 --> 00:34:33.458]  I am fired up today and there's just so much news and information to cover.
[00:34:34.779 --> 00:34:40.184]  But I got all these audio clips today so we better get started with them or we will never air them by the end.
[00:34:40.284 --> 00:34:41.525]  Tom Cruise is coming up later.
[00:34:42.266 --> 00:34:46.089]  But right now, now again, this music video got made, got put on the web.
[00:34:46.549 --> 00:34:47.890]  Nobody's taking credit for it.
[00:34:48.191 --> 00:34:49.692]  Contraband.com posted it.
[00:34:50.465 --> 00:34:51.946]  One of these risque, trendy sites.
[00:34:52.526 --> 00:34:55.968]  It's got clips out of some of my videos in it, which we found to be interesting.
[00:34:56.268 --> 00:34:58.169]  I'd like to know who this talented individual is.
[00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:03.612]  I'd like to enlist them.
[00:35:04.193 --> 00:35:05.413]  There's so many great people.
[00:35:06.194 --> 00:35:10.496]  But again, it's powerful with the audio, even more powerful with the video.
[00:35:10.856 --> 00:35:13.998]  And it's posted on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:35:14.358 --> 00:35:15.439]  But go ahead and roll that.
[00:35:15.479 --> 00:35:17.940]  We'll be back in about three and a half minutes with more news and your calls.
[00:35:19.667 --> 00:35:20.848]  Everybody up in the public exhibition, get up off your feet!
[00:35:20.868 --> 00:35:20.988]  Get up!
[00:35:21.008 --> 00:35:21.529]  Put your hands together!
[00:35:21.549 --> 00:35:21.849]  How you doing?

[00:35:37.763 --> 00:35:37.963]  Revolution!
[00:35:37.983 --> 00:35:38.203]  Revolution!
[00:35:38.223 --> 00:35:38.443]  Revolution!
[00:35:38.483 --> 00:35:38.743]  Revolution!
[00:35:38.763 --> 00:35:38.964]  Revolution!
[00:35:39.004 --> 00:35:39.204]  Revolution!
[00:35:39.224 --> 00:35:39.424]  Revolution!
[00:35:39.444 --> 00:35:39.644]  Revolution!
[00:35:39.664 --> 00:35:39.864]  Revolution!
[00:35:39.884 --> 00:35:40.084]  Revolution!
[00:35:40.105 --> 00:35:40.305]  Revolution!
[00:35:40.325 --> 00:35:40.545]  Revolution!
[00:35:40.565 --> 00:35:40.845]  Revolution!
[00:35:40.865 --> 00:35:41.085]  Revolution!
[00:35:41.105 --> 00:35:41.306]  Revolution!
[00:35:41.346 --> 00:35:41.546]  Revolution!
[00:35:41.566 --> 00:35:41.766]  Revolution!
[00:35:41.786 --> 00:35:41.986]  Revolution!
[00:35:42.026 --> 00:35:42.226]  Revolution!
[00:35:42.246 --> 00:35:42.467]  Revolution!
[00:35:42.487 --> 00:35:42.707]  Revolution!
[00:35:42.727 --> 00:35:42.927]  Revolution!
[00:35:42.967 --> 00:35:43.187]  Revolution!
[00:35:43.207 --> 00:35:43.407]  Revolution!
[00:35:43.427 --> 00:35:43.648]  Revolution!
[00:35:43.668 --> 00:35:43.888]  Revolution!
[00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:44.128]  Revolution!
[00:35:44.148 --> 00:35:44.348]  Revolution!
[00:35:44.388 --> 00:35:44.648]  Revolution!
[00:35:44.688 --> 00:35:44.889]  Revolution!
[00:35:44.909 --> 00:35:45.189]  Revolution!
[00:35:45.209 --> 00:35:45.449]  Revolution!
[00:35:45.469 --> 00:35:45.669]  Revolution!
[00:35:45.689 --> 00:35:45.889]  Revolution!
[00:35:45.909 --> 00:35:46.150]  Revolution!
[00:35:46.170 --> 00:35:46.470]  Revolution!
[00:35:46.530 --> 00:35:46.730]  Revolution!
[00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:46.970]  Revolution!
[00:35:46.990 --> 00:35:47.191]  Revolution!
[00:35:47.211 --> 00:35:47.411]  Revolution!
[00:35:47.431 --> 00:35:47.671]  Revolution
[00:35:51.059 --> 00:35:54.961]  The most important election of our lives!
[00:35:54.981 --> 00:35:57.943]  Evil has found a willing servant.
[00:35:58.604 --> 00:35:59.344]  We're going to do anything.
[00:36:00.044 --> 00:36:01.625]  We're going to go the distance.
[00:36:01.645 --> 00:36:02.946]  Smoke them out of their caves.
[00:36:03.246 --> 00:36:04.427]  Wanted dead or alive.
[00:36:04.867 --> 00:36:06.628]  Courage America!
[00:36:06.788 --> 00:36:12.392]  As President, John Kerry will mobilize the full arsenal of America's power.
[00:36:12.452 --> 00:36:14.273]  March to the government.
[00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.716]  I really encourage killing innocent life.
[00:36:18.816 --> 00:36:22.419]  Hatred, destruction and death.
[00:36:22.639 --> 00:36:31.125]  As President John Kerry will lead Nazi Stormtroopers to defeat and destroy the world.
[00:36:32.286 --> 00:36:33.748]  We are corporate criminals.
[00:36:34.669 --> 00:36:36.190]  We will spoil you.
[00:36:37.191 --> 00:36:38.913]  The armies of the darkness.
[00:36:39.133 --> 00:36:41.315]  It is all a whim of mine.
[00:36:41.335 --> 00:36:42.697]  This is a worldwide enterprise.
[00:36:42.817 --> 00:36:43.637]  Don't you believe me?
[00:36:43.938 --> 00:36:45.079]  Accomplished liars.
[00:36:45.279 --> 00:36:47.061]  All that you knew is what I told you.
[00:36:47.221 --> 00:36:47.922]  The world in evil.
[00:36:48.102 --> 00:36:49.483]  A new and evil time.
[00:36:49.703 --> 00:36:51.125]  He's a dangerous man.
[00:36:51.205 --> 00:36:53.948]  There is much evil in this world.
[00:36:55.129 --> 00:37:02.555]  There's a misname in war on terror.
[00:37:02.755 --> 00:37:18.949]  It ought to be the struggle against ideological extremists who do not believe in free societies, who happen to use terror as a weapon to try to shake the conscience of the free world.
[00:37:19.781 --> 00:37:21.462]  I don't want to sound like a broken record.
[00:37:21.482 --> 00:37:23.283]  I don't want to sound like a broken record.
[00:37:23.303 --> 00:37:25.144]  Sounds like a broken record, Shepard.
[00:37:25.164 --> 00:37:27.226]  I don't want to sound like a broken record.
[00:37:27.306 --> 00:37:29.287]  I don't want to sound like a broken record.
[00:37:29.327 --> 00:37:30.728]  Sounds like a broken record.
[00:37:30.808 --> 00:37:32.389]  We've got better hair.
[00:37:32.409 --> 00:37:33.429]  Better hair.
[00:37:33.469 --> 00:37:35.550]  We will double our special forces.
[00:37:36.831 --> 00:37:41.815]  We don't have to talk about the Democratic candidates, right?
[00:37:41.835 --> 00:37:45.577]  They all look like a bunch of girly men.
[00:37:45.597 --> 00:37:47.058]  You're gonna be destroyed.
[00:38:09.652 --> 00:38:13.514]  I can't cover up the secret societies.
[00:38:13.554 --> 00:38:15.774]  The office of the president.
[00:38:15.814 --> 00:38:18.335]  We're all in the midst of a suspect.
[00:38:18.415 --> 00:38:22.037]  We intentionally deceived the American people.
[00:38:22.097 --> 00:38:24.918]  Our government will buy our time.
[00:38:43.564 --> 00:38:44.264]  Alright!
[00:38:44.284 --> 00:38:45.564]  Oh-ho!
[00:38:46.544 --> 00:38:47.144]  I'll tell ya!
[00:38:47.524 --> 00:38:49.725]  And, uh... You know what?
[00:38:49.765 --> 00:38:52.886]  Let's go ahead and get this Daily Show piece out of the way.
[00:38:52.906 --> 00:38:55.786]  I just love it where they get into the new double speak.
[00:38:56.927 --> 00:38:57.087]  Uh...
[00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:04.085]  We'll go ahead and roll this piece and then we'll get into the news and straight back to your calls.
[00:39:04.105 --> 00:39:09.910]  This is a little bit shorter than the last piece and it's also posted on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:11.031]  You got that next clip ready?
[00:39:12.332 --> 00:39:13.473]  Go ahead and hit it then.
[00:39:13.993 --> 00:39:17.716]  For more on what's going on, we're joined by Senior Military Analyst Stephen Colbert.
[00:39:17.736 --> 00:39:18.957]  Stephen, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:39:27.245 --> 00:39:34.450]  It seems to me that the problem the administration is having is not so much what's going on in Iraq, as much as how they're talking about what's going on.
[00:39:34.490 --> 00:39:39.013]  It's the disconnect between what people are seeing and how they are describing it.
[00:39:39.053 --> 00:39:42.536]  It undermines our trust in the execution of the war.
[00:39:43.076 --> 00:39:45.278]  Well, John, that's your problem right there.
[00:39:45.678 --> 00:39:52.183]  You're worried about what they should do to earn your trust, not what you should do to earn theirs.
[00:39:55.558 --> 00:39:57.379]  Why do I need to earn the trust of the administration?
[00:39:57.399 --> 00:39:58.319]  It doesn't matter, John.
[00:39:58.359 --> 00:40:05.642]  The point is, the administration has, always has had, and will continue to have this situation under their complete control.
[00:40:06.703 --> 00:40:15.046]  Steve, and when the Vice President says, the insurgency is in its last throes, and Donald Rumsfeld says, that could mean twelve years, isn't that contradictory?
[00:40:15.426 --> 00:40:21.549]  Well, John, as a member of the cynical, knee-jerk, reactionary, media-liberal, Ivy League, Taxachusetts elite,
[00:40:22.309 --> 00:40:27.852]  I can see how you would find a discrepancy between the words last throws and 12-year insurgency.
[00:40:28.272 --> 00:40:32.294]  But your mistake is looking at what's happening in Iraq on a human scale.
[00:40:32.874 --> 00:40:36.756]  The administration is looking at it from a geological perspective.
[00:40:37.416 --> 00:40:40.318]  After all, it took a billion years for the earth to cool.
[00:40:40.738 --> 00:40:45.380]  If 12 years isn't last throws, then I don't know Pangaea from Gondwanaland.
[00:40:52.785 --> 00:40:53.546]  Forget the time, thanks.
[00:40:54.506 --> 00:40:56.768]  What about just the idea of the insurgency in general?
[00:40:56.928 --> 00:41:00.030]  I want to play this pre-war assessment by Vice President Chen.
[00:41:00.930 --> 00:41:09.095]  Do you think the American people are prepared for a long, costly, and bloody battle with significant American casualties?
[00:41:09.916 --> 00:41:14.639]  I don't think it's likely to unfold that way, Tim, because I really do believe we will be greeted as liberators.
[00:41:15.680 --> 00:41:16.120]  What's your point?
[00:41:19.423 --> 00:41:21.525]  That scenario is, that was before the war.
[00:41:21.565 --> 00:41:22.286]  They soft-pedaled it.
[00:41:22.306 --> 00:41:23.668]  That scenario didn't play out.
[00:41:23.828 --> 00:41:24.829]  But it did, John.
[00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:29.394]  All Cheney said was that they would welcome us as liberators.
[00:41:29.775 --> 00:41:32.798]  Simply meaning, there would be more than one welcomer.
[00:41:33.499 --> 00:41:34.600]  I happen to have a list here.
[00:41:36.022 --> 00:41:38.745]  Ali Al-Hassan of Baghdad welcomes us.
[00:41:39.818 --> 00:41:45.202]  What about the most famous example of a seeming miscue by this White House?
[00:41:45.242 --> 00:41:50.026]  Bush in the flight suit on the aircraft carrier and then in front of the banner saying, Mission Accomplished.
[00:42:04.477 --> 00:42:06.097]  John, John, John, John, John.
[00:42:06.778 --> 00:42:12.819]  That's just more of your western, linear, left-to-right, letters-in-consecutive-order, syllable-based banner reading.
[00:42:13.379 --> 00:42:18.981]  The true message was there, you just had to read the letters in anagram form as it was intended.
[00:42:19.841 --> 00:42:20.381]  Come on!
[00:42:20.921 --> 00:42:21.462]  I lied.
[00:42:22.242 --> 00:42:23.542]  So scampish.
[00:42:26.783 --> 00:42:28.383]  You wanted it spelled out for you, John?
[00:42:28.444 --> 00:42:29.124]  There it is.
[00:42:29.344 --> 00:42:33.705]  Even you would have to admit, George W. Bush will go down in history as this nation's
[00:42:34.386 --> 00:42:36.907]  Scampiest, Commander-in-Chief.
[00:42:38.347 --> 00:42:39.488]  Oh, man, I tell ya.
[00:42:40.428 --> 00:42:41.749]  Powerful stuff.
[00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:51.272]  Coming up, the Tom Cruise clip will also play that Paul Harvey descends to even lower levels than Michael, I want your guns, I'm a dirty big-nick savage.
[00:42:52.792 --> 00:43:01.795]  Alright, let's get into Karl Rove first, then into the military industrial complex takeover of the U.S., now in the Washington Post and New York Times, and all of your calls.
[00:43:02.796 --> 00:43:03.236]  But, uh,
[00:43:04.711 --> 00:43:09.675]  I guess I should just read this article and analyze the propaganda as we go.
[00:43:11.056 --> 00:43:18.181]  Again, I'd love to pop the champagne and run around crazy saying, Carl Rove has fallen, Carl Rove, we're all saved, the dragon has been slain.
[00:43:19.522 --> 00:43:25.506]  Carl Rove is a super gopher, he's a minion, he's the real president, or vice president with Dick Cheney being the president.
[00:43:26.627 --> 00:43:27.468]  He runs things.
[00:43:28.419 --> 00:43:41.142]  But at the same time, we need to understand that he runs the current agenda for the most powerful regional government inside the global government that we already have formed, and now becoming public around us.
[00:43:41.202 --> 00:43:45.623]  And so, if he is brought down, everybody will think, oh, everything's okay now.
[00:43:45.823 --> 00:43:47.044]  Oh, we punish them.
[00:43:47.064 --> 00:43:48.184]  It's just like Richard Nixon.
[00:43:49.269 --> 00:44:01.216]  With the price controls and all the other manipulations and machinations that went on in creating, what, ten different giant federal agencies and just, you know, opening up China and just all of this.
[00:44:02.437 --> 00:44:06.839]  And then they hung him out to dry on some petty issue, some petty, petty break-in.
[00:44:08.735 --> 00:44:19.384]  It's the same story, and people thought, oh, everything's okay, and they brought in Gerald Ford, and George Bush, and this whole gaggle of what are the neocon captains of our country today.
[00:44:20.005 --> 00:44:22.547]  Karl Rove, worse than Osama Bin Laden.
[00:44:22.587 --> 00:44:27.130]  Well, I agree, he's worse than Osama Bin Laden, because Bin Laden works for these people.
[00:44:27.151 --> 00:44:32.175]  Let's get into the article by Ted Roll, posted on Yahoo.
[00:44:33.015 --> 00:44:35.878]  In war, collaborators are more dangerous than enemy forces.
[00:44:36.974 --> 00:44:47.562]  Again, in war, collaborators are more dangerous than enemy forces, for they betray the intimate knowledge in painful detail and demoralize by their cynical example.
[00:44:48.643 --> 00:45:02.033]  That explains why, at the end of the occupations, the newly liberated exact vengeance upon the treacherous countrymen, like the Vichy French, even they allow foreign troops to conduct an orderly withdrawal.
[00:45:02.873 --> 00:45:09.979]  So again, they will exact vengeance upon their treacherous countrymen, even while they allow foreign troops to conduct an orderly withdrawal.
[00:45:10.559 --> 00:45:24.610]  If a state-controlled media insists there is such a creature as a global war on terrorism, our enemies are underground Islamist organizations allied or ideologically similar to those that attacked us on 9-11.
[00:45:24.850 --> 00:45:26.552]  But who are the collaborators?
[00:45:27.754 --> 00:45:32.555]  The right points to critics like Michael Moore, yours truly, and Ward Churchill.
[00:45:32.975 --> 00:45:35.035]  Yes, I would point to Ward Churchill.
[00:45:35.535 --> 00:45:39.796]  Again, he acts like Bin Laden's some hero and not the CIA asset he is.
[00:45:40.456 --> 00:45:41.136]  Very dangerous.
[00:45:41.236 --> 00:45:46.737]  Moore minimalizes Bush's involvement and acts like he was just some idiot who was fishing too much.
[00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:54.379]  The Colorado professor who points out the gaping chasm between America's highfalutin rhetoric and its historical record.
[00:45:54.399 --> 00:45:54.799]  But these
[00:45:56.269 --> 00:46:05.779]  That deniers are guilty only of the all-American actions of criticism and dissent, not to mention speaking uncomfortable truths to liars and deniers.
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:17.131]  As far as we know, no one on what passes for the left, which would be the center-right anywhere else, has betrayed the United States in the GWOT.
[00:46:18.084 --> 00:46:28.669]  No anti-Bush progressive has made common cause with Al-Qaeda, Hamas, the Islamic movement of Uzbekistan, or any other officially designated terrorist group.
[00:46:28.729 --> 00:46:35.612]  No American liberal has handed over classified information or worked to undermine the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:46:35.952 --> 00:46:41.694]  No, what the liberals have done is made the anti-war, anti-globalist view look stupid.
[00:46:42.254 --> 00:46:43.535]  And you've done that by design.
[00:46:44.525 --> 00:46:48.950]  But it now appears that Karl Rove, GOP golden boy, has done exactly that.
[00:46:49.050 --> 00:47:00.742]  Last week, Time Magazine turned over its reporter's notes to a special prosecutor assigned to learn who told Republican columnist Bob Novak that Valerie Klame was a CIA agent.
[00:47:00.842 --> 00:47:01.683]  She was a spy chief.
[00:47:02.501 --> 00:47:24.656]  The revelation, which effectively ended claims CIA career, and evidence clearly shows, led to the death of some of the operatives, I added that, and may have endangered her life, followed her husband Joe Wilson's publication of a New York Times op-ed piece that embarrassed the Bush administration by debunking its claims that Saddam Hussein tried to buy uranium from Niger, which admittedly is a fake document I would add.
[00:47:25.036 --> 00:47:30.520]  Times' cowardly decision to break its promise to the confidential source had had one beneficial side effect.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.782]  According to Newsweek, it indicates that Karl Rove himself made the call to Novak.
[00:47:36.503 --> 00:47:37.943]  Of course, something that important.
[00:47:38.043 --> 00:47:39.644]  My info is that Cheney ordered him.
[00:47:40.244 --> 00:47:54.230]  One might have expected Rove, the master White House political strategist who engineered the Bush's 2000 coup d'etat and post-911 permanent war public relations campaign, to have ordered a flunky underling to carry out this act of high treason.
[00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:57.732]  But as the Arab saying goes, arrogance diminishes wisdom.
[00:47:58.487 --> 00:48:05.199]  Rove, who's gaping maw, recently vomited forth that Democrats didn't care about 9-11 as a typical silent.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:11.384]  He did talk to the Times reporter, but never knowingly disclosed classified information, claims his attorney.
[00:48:11.424 --> 00:48:14.526]  But there's circumstantial evidence to go along with Times' leaked notes.
[00:48:14.987 --> 00:48:23.974]  Artie Fleischer abruptly resigned as Bush's press secretary on May 16th, 2003, about the same time that White House became aware of Ambassador Wilson's plans to go public.
[00:48:24.394 --> 00:48:26.336]  Wilson's article appeared at July 6th.
[00:48:26.656 --> 00:48:32.781]  Did Fleischer quit because he didn't want to act as a spokesman for Rove's plan to betray CIA agent Plum?
[00:48:35.278 --> 00:48:41.580]  Another interesting coincidence, Novak published his Plame column on July 14th, Fleischer's last day on the job.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:47.901]  If Newsweek report is accurate, Karl Rove is more morally repugnant and more anti-American than Osama Bin Laden.
[00:48:48.201 --> 00:48:53.323]  Bin Laden, after all, has no affiliation with, and therefore no presumed loyalty to, the United States.
[00:48:53.763 --> 00:48:54.623]  No affiliation.
[00:48:55.143 --> 00:48:56.584]  His code name is Tim Osman.
[00:48:56.624 --> 00:48:58.205]  He's admittedly CIA and protected.
[00:48:58.405 --> 00:49:04.648]  The CIA Section Chief met with him for 10 days at the American Hospital in Dubai, July 4th to July 14th.
[00:49:05.528 --> 00:49:07.409]  Rove, on the other hand, is a U.S.
[00:49:07.429 --> 00:49:11.271]  citizen and as Deputy White House Chief of Staff, a high-ranking official of the U.S.
[00:49:11.311 --> 00:49:14.653]  government, sworn to uphold and defend our Constitution, its laws and interests.
[00:49:15.053 --> 00:49:18.975]  Yet he sold out America just to get even with Joe Wilson.
[00:49:20.481 --> 00:49:21.541]  And that part is true.
[00:49:22.061 --> 00:49:25.883]  Osama Bin Laden, or Tim Osman, conversely, is loyal to his cause.
[00:49:26.023 --> 00:49:26.963]  Total propaganda.
[00:49:27.443 --> 00:49:30.404]  He has never exposed an Al Qaeda agent's identity to the media.
[00:49:30.944 --> 00:49:42.067]  Knowingly revealing claims name and undercover status to the media is a violation of Intelligence Identities Protection Act and is punishable by as much as 10 years in prison, notes the Washington Post.
[00:49:42.467 --> 00:49:45.488]  Unmasking an intelligence agent during a time of war, however,
[00:49:46.391 --> 00:49:50.774]  Shirley rises to giving aid and comfort to America's enemies in treason.
[00:49:51.154 --> 00:49:54.196]  Treason is punishable by execution under United States Code.
[00:49:54.596 --> 00:49:57.778]  How far up the White House food chain does the rot of treason go?
[00:49:58.078 --> 00:50:00.900]  Bush has always known how to keep Rove in his place.
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:05.382]  Wrote the Times in 02 about a symbolic relationship that dates back to 73.
[00:50:06.952 --> 00:50:07.272]  Yes.
[00:50:07.773 --> 00:50:10.295]  This isn't some rogue plumber's operation.
[00:50:10.335 --> 00:50:14.718]  Rogue would never go it alone on a high-stakes action like Valerie Plame.
[00:50:15.078 --> 00:50:24.365]  It is safe to bet that other high-ranking figures in the Bush Cabal, almost certainly Dick Cheney and possibly Lord Bush himself, I don't believe that Bush does nothing but drool and
[00:50:24.805 --> 00:50:26.467]  Play golf and jog and take naps.
[00:50:26.907 --> 00:50:29.709]  Signed over before Roe called Novak.
[00:50:30.090 --> 00:50:33.393]  For the sake of national security, those involved should be removed from office at once.
[00:50:33.873 --> 00:50:44.102]  Roe and his collaborators should quickly resign and face prosecution for betraying their country, but giving their sense of personal entitlement, impeachment is probably the best we can hope for.
[00:50:44.422 --> 00:50:49.126]  Congress and all Americans should place patriotism above party loyalty.
[00:50:50.908 --> 00:50:52.249]  Yeah, well, the left didn't want to
[00:50:53.473 --> 00:50:56.955]  Call Clinton up on treason charges for CHICOM generals in the White House.
[00:50:58.315 --> 00:50:59.716]  This is all ridiculous.
[00:51:02.197 --> 00:51:03.838]  What really happened September 11th?
[00:51:03.998 --> 00:51:05.159]  And who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.799 --> 00:51:07.080]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:13.042]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.303 --> 00:51:18.565]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem, reaction, solution.
[00:51:18.865 --> 00:51:20.466]  Brace yourselves as the new world order
[00:51:20.606 --> 00:51:23.009]  The program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.169 --> 00:51:26.954]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:27.214 --> 00:51:31.860]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:38.208]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:51:38.248 --> 00:51:40.070]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:40.550 --> 00:51:42.631]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Terry today.

[00:52:01.903 --> 00:52:04.887]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.248 --> 00:52:14.079]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:19.086]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.526 --> 00:52:26.248]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.648 --> 00:52:38.472]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.912 --> 00:52:43.374]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:53:51.938 --> 00:53:52.538]  Call now!
[00:53:52.578 --> 00:53:53.559]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:53:53.599 --> 00:53:55.399]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:54:13.172 --> 00:54:22.116]  What my point is, is that administration officials, whether it's in Bill Clinton's administration or George Bush's administration, are like shark teeth.
[00:54:22.816 --> 00:54:30.139]  You can pull these teeth out, spend all your energy knocking the teeth out of the great white, another set is just going to roll forward.
[00:54:30.899 --> 00:54:33.600]  We have to deal with the beast itself, the New World Order.
[00:54:34.255 --> 00:54:40.460]  I mean, these little politicians and enemy minds, like Karl Rove, are a dime a dozen.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:42.382]  Yes, he's got power.
[00:54:42.442 --> 00:54:46.065]  Yes, he's carrying out an operation, but only so long as he's useful.
[00:54:46.685 --> 00:54:57.554]  And the globalists routinely do this, burn their minions when their approval ratings get down to 27%, and then everybody goes back to sleep for another five years, until everybody wakes up again.
[00:54:58.434 --> 00:55:01.237]  So we shouldn't get too focused on this.
[00:55:01.597 --> 00:55:02.838]  I mean, I want to see him go to jail.
[00:55:03.775 --> 00:55:04.195]  He should.
[00:55:04.215 --> 00:55:06.616]  He's a horrible creature.
[00:55:06.837 --> 00:55:10.578]  But, again, he wouldn't be doing that unless higher-ups were telling him to do it.
[00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:13.280]  That goes for Dick Cheney and Bush and all of them.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:19.583]  What is really important is CAFTA set to pass the House in the next week.
[00:55:20.703 --> 00:55:24.145]  What is really important is the new Attorney Generalship.
[00:55:24.805 --> 00:55:29.968]  It looks like it may be Alberto Gonzalez, if not now, or when Rehnquist leaves in the next six months.
[00:55:30.368 --> 00:55:31.689]  That is important, folks.
[00:55:32.592 --> 00:55:38.035]  We need to focus on issues like this, our open borders, the gun control legislation in the Congress.
[00:55:39.316 --> 00:55:42.078]  I mean, so many people, Bush, Bush, Bush is evil, Bush, Bush.
[00:55:42.418 --> 00:55:44.879]  Folks, it's part of a worldwide agenda.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.561]  Bush is a figurehead.
[00:55:48.061 --> 00:55:51.223]  You know, like on the front of an old Man of War sailing ship.
[00:55:52.344 --> 00:55:57.587]  Before we go to Minow and Robert and Roger and these loaded phones here, very briefly,
[00:55:58.931 --> 00:56:02.793]  My new film, Martial Law, is out, and it is three hours long.
[00:56:03.033 --> 00:56:15.458]  It is a tour de force, a mini-series, covering the latest 9-11 info, getting into who the globalists are and their worldwide plan, and their mindset, their agenda, and the latest police state developments.
[00:56:15.959 --> 00:56:17.299]  You need to have this video.
[00:56:17.319 --> 00:56:19.700]  $25.95, second copy for $19.95, third copy for $16.95, down to $14.
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.261]  My last film, American Dictators, is excellent.
[00:56:26.983 --> 00:56:27.784]  Buy one copy for $19.95.
[00:56:28.244 --> 00:56:30.145]  Each additional copy is $5.95.
[00:56:30.625 --> 00:56:32.727]  You can give it to people as a gift.
[00:56:33.087 --> 00:56:34.848]  Or just buy one copy and make copies.
[00:56:35.489 --> 00:56:38.250]  And yes, your purchase also makes this broadcast possible.
[00:56:38.551 --> 00:56:41.613]  But that pales in significance to the information itself.
[00:56:41.633 --> 00:56:44.114]  But you do support the broadcast and what we're doing.
[00:56:44.134 --> 00:56:49.498]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:56:49.518 --> 00:56:51.519]  These are all very important films.
[00:56:51.759 --> 00:56:52.960]  You need to have them.
[00:56:54.013 --> 00:57:00.555]  The total free number to get these videos is 1-888-253-3139.

[00:57:20.005 --> 00:57:25.148]  We have got my best audio interviews from the radio show, all of my weekly TV reports.
[00:57:26.169 --> 00:57:27.350]  It is just so good.

[00:57:43.960 --> 00:57:45.741]  But the most important thing is the information.
[00:57:45.761 --> 00:57:47.542]  So PrisonPlanet.tv to watch online.

[00:57:59.325 --> 00:57:59.985]  Now we'll start the second hour.
[00:58:00.005 --> 00:58:01.386]  We will go straight to your calls.
[00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:17.732]  Then I'll get into the attack on Posse Comentatus.
[00:58:17.772 --> 00:58:18.473]  Well, not the attack.
[00:58:18.493 --> 00:58:20.014]  They're just getting rid of it.
[00:58:20.034 --> 00:58:22.516]  And very scary with spies everywhere.
[00:58:22.556 --> 00:58:23.797]  Your neighbors being spies.
[00:58:24.218 --> 00:58:27.260]  It's now right out in the biggest papers in the country telling you how great it is.
[00:58:28.381 --> 00:58:30.823]  Masses of news on Alberto Gonzalez.
[00:58:31.424 --> 00:58:34.386]  Just so many police state developments in your face.
[00:58:35.767 --> 00:58:37.569]  Just strap yourselves in, folks.
[00:58:37.629 --> 00:58:38.089]  Get ready.
[00:58:38.129 --> 00:58:38.870]  You're on the Bronco.
[00:58:41.184 --> 00:58:46.029]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:46.069 --> 00:58:46.389]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.409 --> 00:58:46.850]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.862 --> 00:59:09.105]  All over the nation, quietly, from Alabama to Texas, from New York to California, from New Mexico to Oregon,
[00:59:24.175 --> 00:59:34.020]  From Iowa to Florida, the National Guard and the Regular Army are moving the police departments and law enforcement centers into the armories and old bases, merging.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:40.343]  They're openly saying that the new focus will be the military involved in our daily lives with the local police.
[00:59:41.344 --> 00:59:43.705]  That's uber police state.
[00:59:44.289 --> 00:59:45.050]  That's coming up.
[00:59:45.170 --> 00:59:47.172]  More on the Supreme Court nominations.
[00:59:47.952 --> 00:59:48.573]  Just so much.
[00:59:48.593 --> 00:59:50.454]  But let's get to the calls you've been holding long enough.
[00:59:50.935 --> 00:59:52.296]  Minnow in Pennsylvania.
[00:59:52.316 --> 00:59:53.857]  Minnow, watch out for that bass.
[00:59:54.238 --> 00:59:56.920]  Yeah, just keep on hanging in on there.
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:00.543]  I've been hanging in on this stuff, exposing it.
[01:00:01.063 --> 01:00:03.285]  I'm on a smaller local level.
[01:00:04.266 --> 01:00:05.928]  I guess you're kind of like the Chief.
[01:00:06.028 --> 01:00:07.249]  No, I'm not the Chief.
[01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:09.291]  Okay.
[01:00:09.351 --> 01:00:10.872]  The reason I'm calling is
[01:00:11.639 --> 01:00:12.040]  I think?
[01:00:29.786 --> 01:00:32.069]  I have some antique cars.
[01:00:32.309 --> 01:00:32.989]  Sounds nice.
[01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:34.871]  Antique trucks.
[01:00:34.911 --> 01:00:38.395]  And they're using zoning to harass you.
[01:00:38.475 --> 01:00:39.155]  You've got it.
[01:00:39.616 --> 01:00:42.839]  So they've been hassling me for nearly 20 years.
[01:00:42.879 --> 01:00:43.439]  I'm here over 20 years.
[01:00:43.479 --> 01:00:45.321]  But about 3 years ago they had hassled me bad.
[01:00:51.860 --> 01:01:03.350]  You live out in the country and they retroactively change the zoning laws and they want to order you around on your property like it's the Soviet Union?
[01:01:14.381 --> 01:01:27.012]  And they're saying, they're asking judgment of $8,000 plus the cost and stuff, and they're saying... Are they saying they're going to haul your property off, or are they saying that they're going to charge you for not cleaning it?
[01:01:28.373 --> 01:01:37.340]  Uh, what they're saying is the judgment against the fine, or either put a judgment on the real estate, and they're saying $500 a day.
[01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.362]  Yeah, aren't you grandfathered?
[01:01:41.726 --> 01:01:44.488]  I've been here for over 20 years.
[01:01:44.528 --> 01:01:47.470]  But I mean, when you moved in, were there these land restrictions in force?
[01:01:49.011 --> 01:01:59.139]  I think they're saying 76 they adopted, but I got one of their zoning books here.
[01:01:59.159 --> 01:02:02.462]  Well, look, it's classic harassment, sir, and there's different remedies.
[01:02:03.123 --> 01:02:06.546]  Okay, what I'd like to do is fax this stuff to you and you'll have the names and phone numbers on.
[01:02:26.030 --> 01:02:26.531]  Literally, sir.
[01:02:26.571 --> 01:02:28.252]  I got 2,000 emails yesterday.
[01:02:28.733 --> 01:02:39.724]  Hundreds of people call me a week where they, you know, lived on a family farm for two generations, and they're saying, we're going to take your property because you built a new barn on it, and there's no law saying they can't.
[01:02:39.824 --> 01:02:41.346]  I mean, it's just tyranny, sir.
[01:02:41.986 --> 01:02:46.530]  You know, this is just like one more report of your position is under attack by enemy forces.
[01:02:46.810 --> 01:02:57.399]  We are aware of the enemy attack, and I'm sorry, you know, here in my little corner of the world, I can only, I mean, I guessed what they were doing to you because it's so prolific.
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:02.443]  Yeah, uh, what I was wanting to do is fax it to you.
[01:03:02.923 --> 01:03:04.244]  Okay, well, you're welcome to fax it to me.
[01:03:04.264 --> 01:03:05.225]  Let me give you my fax number.
[01:03:05.585 --> 01:03:06.005]  Okay.
[01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:06.726]  It's 512... Okay. 899...
[01:03:11.351 --> 01:03:13.092]  Okay.
[01:03:15.013 --> 01:03:13.092]  9809.
[01:03:15.033 --> 01:03:16.334]  9809.
[01:03:15.673 --> 01:03:16.334]  Yep.
[01:03:16.354 --> 01:03:16.514]  512-899-9809.
[01:03:16.654 --> 01:03:17.154]  Okay.
[01:03:17.354 --> 01:03:23.558]  I'll fax it to you and it'll have the phone numbers and stuff on it.
[01:03:24.659 --> 01:03:26.239]  I'm sorry, they're going after you.
[01:03:26.460 --> 01:03:27.140]  Are you older?
[01:03:28.241 --> 01:03:28.401]  I'm 63.
[01:03:28.961 --> 01:03:37.566]  The township lawyer and the safety level on there.
[01:03:37.786 --> 01:03:39.587]  Well, you need to go before the council and the county.
[01:03:40.231 --> 01:03:45.317]  We're bored and you need to, you need to maybe have to sue him for harassment.
[01:03:45.917 --> 01:03:46.358]  Take care.
[01:03:46.398 --> 01:03:48.300]  I'm really sorry to hear the enemy's attacking you.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.481]  Sir, that's what the enemy does.
[01:03:49.602 --> 01:03:50.242]  We've got to go.
[01:03:54.477 --> 01:03:57.338]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.598 --> 01:03:59.179]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.519 --> 01:04:04.202]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.522 --> 01:04:08.944]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.384 --> 01:04:13.566]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.786 --> 01:04:16.627]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.707 --> 01:04:21.388]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.568 --> 01:04:25.969]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[01:06:57.887 --> 01:06:58.547]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.208 --> 01:07:00.268]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.969 --> 01:07:02.069]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:03.550]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.311 --> 01:07:05.191]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.211 --> 01:07:09.654]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.054 --> 01:07:14.197]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:19.520]  Alright, we're gonna get into your calls.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.141]  Also, the
[01:07:22.193 --> 01:07:27.915]  Possible fall of Bush's brain, Colonel Rove, as it comes out, of course, over the weekend and now heating up.
[01:07:28.495 --> 01:07:45.840]  He's the guy that ratted out the CIA spy chief, one of the top spy chiefs in Europe, just to burn her husband, who exposed the fact the Niger-Uranium story was a complete fraud on the eve of war to go into Iraq.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.541]  We'll also get into Alberto Gonzalez.
[01:07:48.561 --> 01:07:51.782]  I knew it would happen last Friday when Paul Watson and I wrote that article.
[01:07:52.509 --> 01:07:58.971]  About the move to install Alberto Gonzales as the new Supreme Court Justice out of the Attorney General spot.
[01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:15.795]  Now that Senator Day O'Connor has given a resignation, and sure enough, I'm hearing it on talk radio, you're a liberal if you're against Alberto Gonzales, who is pro-abortion, pro-radical gun control, pro-open borders, member of MECHA, Hispanic racist group,
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:21.324]  And he is also the torture architect, saying they can torture people until they die.
[01:08:21.884 --> 01:08:23.865]  And that if they don't call it torture, it's not torture.
[01:08:24.406 --> 01:08:25.867]  And he says Bush is above the law.
[01:08:25.907 --> 01:08:26.527]  So we'll get into that.
[01:08:26.547 --> 01:08:29.930]  We're about to talk to Robert and Roger and Scott and Kevin and Rick.
[01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:35.894]  But before we do that, I know about half of our affiliates don't carry the first five-minute segment.
[01:08:36.915 --> 01:08:40.858]  But years ago, affiliates requested that they didn't want to carry the propaganda news.
[01:08:42.563 --> 01:08:46.465]  The news feeds out there, so we decided to do that first five minutes live, and we did.
[01:08:46.925 --> 01:08:52.327]  So some stations missed what I usually take calls in that segment, what that caller was just saying.
[01:08:52.907 --> 01:09:00.950]  Minnow, from Pennsylvania, a 63 year old man, 20 years living on their little farm.
[01:09:02.691 --> 01:09:10.534]  And they've come in and they're trying to find them and feed them because saying you can't have horses on your land retroactively and you can't have these old cars.
[01:09:12.206 --> 01:09:16.710]  And, you know, I want to help Menno, and he's welcome to fax me his information, but here's the problem.
[01:09:16.730 --> 01:09:18.892]  You know, he was saying I'm like a chief and he's like an Indian.
[01:09:19.432 --> 01:09:20.193]  That's not the case.
[01:09:20.313 --> 01:09:31.882]  Mainly, I'm like a wartime broadcaster behind enemy lines, or really on the lines, on the front lines of the war, and I literally, yesterday, downloaded my email.
[01:09:31.942 --> 01:09:35.485]  It was over 2,000 emails, and only about 800 of those were spam.
[01:09:36.858 --> 01:09:45.641]  I spent hours and hours trying to read it all, and my staff tries, and you should still keep sending it, because we get a lot of good news stories from you, a lot of great tips, but I could certainly never respond to all of it.
[01:09:45.681 --> 01:09:47.722]  People get mad that I can't respond, and I'm sorry.
[01:09:48.122 --> 01:09:49.363]  We don't have a big operation.
[01:09:49.383 --> 01:09:52.864]  If you support us, maybe we can get more people in a bigger office and do that.
[01:09:55.105 --> 01:10:03.088]  But literally, the equivalent is like, I'm a firebase in Vietnam, and we've got a giant, say, Tet Offensive going on, and I've got
[01:10:03.743 --> 01:10:13.929]  You know, 10,000 troops on my fence, and I've got about 500 people in my base, and I'm being rocketed and hit and attacked, and there's just enemy forces everywhere.
[01:10:13.949 --> 01:10:31.979]  They're land-grabbing, gun-grabbing, they're grabbing people's children all around us, force-drugging, giant prisons being built everywhere, troops training with the Austin Police, giant command base with the local police built out of the airport, into Posse Comuntadas, open borders, illegal aliens everywhere, it's like the Alamo, I'm swinging my musket,
[01:10:33.101 --> 01:10:38.522]  And coming into the firebase are the other firebases and other units just all over the battle lines.
[01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:39.082]  We're being hit!
[01:10:39.102 --> 01:10:39.803]  We're being attacked!
[01:10:39.963 --> 01:10:40.483]  We're under attack!
[01:10:40.503 --> 01:10:41.383]  We're taking our property!
[01:10:41.403 --> 01:10:42.363]  They're taking our cows!
[01:10:42.383 --> 01:10:43.364]  They're taking our children!
[01:10:43.804 --> 01:10:44.564]  We're under attack!
[01:10:44.604 --> 01:10:46.824]  The SWAT teams just hit us!
[01:10:46.844 --> 01:10:48.285]  They just tasered our five-year-old!
[01:10:48.325 --> 01:10:50.705]  We're under... They're pouring in!
[01:10:50.825 --> 01:10:54.506]  What's going... They just chatter everywhere!
[01:10:54.526 --> 01:10:55.246]  We're under... Help!
[01:10:55.406 --> 01:10:56.047]  Give us support!
[01:10:56.107 --> 01:10:56.647]  Fire support!
[01:10:56.687 --> 01:10:57.187]  Fire support!
[01:10:57.207 --> 01:10:57.687]  They're coming in!
[01:11:05.819 --> 01:11:06.899]  I mean, that's what's going on.
[01:11:06.919 --> 01:11:09.320]  They're taking our pension funds!
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:09.720]  Ah!
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:10.280]  Oh, no!
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.540]  They just shipped our jobs overseas!
[01:11:11.740 --> 01:11:11.940]  Ah!
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:12.200]  Ah!
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.361]  They just passed captain!
[01:11:13.481 --> 01:11:13.881]  Oh, no!
[01:11:14.041 --> 01:11:14.181]  Ah!
[01:11:14.281 --> 01:11:15.641]  I mean, folks, that's what it's like.
[01:11:18.082 --> 01:11:18.942]  It's just literally.
[01:11:19.242 --> 01:11:21.202]  They just found new cancer viruses in this vaccine!
[01:11:21.262 --> 01:11:22.563]  They've increased the mercury levels!
[01:11:24.043 --> 01:11:25.963]  They're doing a biological test in my town!
[01:11:26.463 --> 01:11:27.424]  It's in the mainstream paper!
[01:11:27.444 --> 01:11:28.784]  They're gonna be spraying us next week!
[01:11:28.824 --> 01:11:29.464]  Report on it!
[01:11:32.765 --> 01:11:34.145]  I mean, that's what it's like, folks.
[01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:38.092]  And people are begging me for help, and I'm under attack.
[01:11:42.595 --> 01:11:43.115]  Oh, man.
[01:11:45.116 --> 01:11:46.017]  I mean, that's what it's like.
[01:11:48.598 --> 01:11:51.940]  And we just got thousands of transmissions coming in, faxes, emails, calls.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:52.521]  Help us!
[01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:52.921]  Help us!
[01:11:53.081 --> 01:11:53.521]  Help us!
[01:11:53.981 --> 01:11:54.822]  They're here right now!
[01:11:54.862 --> 01:11:55.342]  Help us!
[01:11:56.623 --> 01:11:57.684]  It's horrible!
[01:11:57.944 --> 01:12:01.646]  I mean, literally, I could see that older man and his wife surrounded by hyenas.
[01:12:02.361 --> 01:12:09.446]  You know, and then the hyenas are crouching and laughing and moving in and biting their heels and moving in for the kill to take their property.
[01:12:10.366 --> 01:12:11.227]  And I feel pain.
[01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:12.328]  I understand.
[01:12:12.408 --> 01:12:15.150]  I empathize because, you know, what is conscience?
[01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:19.813]  What is feeling someone's pain, to use Bill Clinton's term, but in a serious fashion?
[01:12:20.153 --> 01:12:20.833]  You empathize.
[01:12:20.854 --> 01:12:22.274]  You understand that could happen to you.
[01:12:22.294 --> 01:12:30.400]  See, this yuppie world of only caring about yourself ensures enslavement because then nobody cares about anybody else and you have a race to the bottom.
[01:12:33.658 --> 01:12:37.160]  And so here I stand, literally, and we're winning some victories, too.
[01:12:37.961 --> 01:12:44.224]  But at the same time, the enemy's turned up the heat, and it's just... You know, I'd like to help those people in New London, Connecticut.
[01:12:44.244 --> 01:12:47.646]  I'd like to help the people down in Pretty Port, Texas, where they're taking their property.
[01:12:47.967 --> 01:12:52.389]  I'd like to thank the people all over the nation having their land taken, and they give them a quarter of what it's worth.
[01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:55.191]  You know, even off the property tax rolls.
[01:12:56.012 --> 01:12:58.273]  I'd like to be able to, you know, expose this.
[01:12:58.333 --> 01:12:59.874]  I mean, I'd like to... I try.
[01:13:00.996 --> 01:13:05.720]  And I get very frustrated and get sped up on air because I want to cover it all, and there's no way to cover it all.
[01:13:07.481 --> 01:13:13.947]  I mean, I'm just one analyst, one fighter, one person, and then meanwhile we've got all the national publications attacking us.
[01:13:14.267 --> 01:13:24.756]  I mean, literally, folks, what is it, like 10, 15 major magazines in the last six months, major newspapers, and then all the COINTELPRO operatives with the so-called Patriot sites, and people want me to respond to that.
[01:13:24.776 --> 01:13:27.238]  If we ever responded to that, we'd never have any time for anything.
[01:13:28.789 --> 01:13:32.151]  And we've just got salvo after salvo slamming into us.
[01:13:32.211 --> 01:13:33.051]  And we're strong.
[01:13:33.331 --> 01:13:35.172]  We're giving as much as we're taking.
[01:13:35.733 --> 01:13:40.435]  But I've got to focus on directing fire on my picket line.
[01:13:40.935 --> 01:13:45.758]  I've got to focus on reloading those howitzers.
[01:13:45.818 --> 01:13:46.178]  Fire!
[01:13:46.238 --> 01:13:46.578]  Fire!
[01:13:46.638 --> 01:13:46.998]  Fire!
[01:13:47.058 --> 01:13:47.339]  Fire!
[01:13:47.559 --> 01:13:47.939]  Attack!
[01:13:47.999 --> 01:13:48.339]  Attack!
[01:13:48.399 --> 01:13:49.120]  Counterattack!
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:49.880]  Counterattack!
[01:13:50.726 --> 01:13:52.567]  And then meanwhile, we go turn the radio on.
[01:13:52.607 --> 01:13:55.447]  Again, the radio's the analogy for the emails, the faxes, the calls.
[01:13:55.827 --> 01:14:02.069]  And it's just total chatter from a thousand, thousand, uh, you know, points.
[01:14:04.010 --> 01:14:05.390]  And it's just intensifying.
[01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:11.892]  And meanwhile, the nightly news is, your government loves you, everything's fine, hit your prozac, everybody's happy, government is good, we love you.
[01:14:12.212 --> 01:14:13.532]  All these fake newscasts.
[01:14:14.653 --> 01:14:19.234]  Um... So that's what it comes down to.
[01:14:20.783 --> 01:14:23.224]  So, don't think I don't care about you, uh, Minnow.
[01:14:23.924 --> 01:14:25.124]  You know, to know what you're going through.
[01:14:25.164 --> 01:14:27.145]  I'm sorry, you know, you know, I can fight this.
[01:14:27.385 --> 01:14:30.246]  I can pick a battle and I can fight it, and I can defeat the Globalist.
[01:14:30.766 --> 01:14:34.087]  On key issues, on certain areas, and I put a bunch of energy into it.
[01:14:35.787 --> 01:14:38.828]  Or I can report on what's going on, and you can go out and fight it.
[01:14:39.709 --> 01:14:44.470]  You know, more than saying I'm the chief or something, no, I'm like a special forces captain.
[01:14:45.111 --> 01:14:49.980]  And they shot me in behind enemy lines ten years ago with the indigenous population.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:51.623]  I'm trying to train you how to fight.
[01:14:52.084 --> 01:14:58.274]  I'm trying to train you how to force multiply our numbers and then have you train others so we can smash these mothers!
[01:15:00.177 --> 01:15:01.277]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[01:15:01.317 --> 01:15:02.198]  You want an analogy?
[01:15:02.238 --> 01:15:02.958]  That's what we are.
[01:15:03.018 --> 01:15:18.242]  We're crouched in the jungle out here with the indigenous population, and we're crouched with the Nazi armies coming into Serbia, you know, in 1942, 1943, you know, with the partisans trying to, you know, rally some type of defense.
[01:15:18.262 --> 01:15:21.283]  I mean, that's what I'm doing.
[01:15:21.903 --> 01:15:29.205]  And I know all around me the enemy's slaughtering people and stealing and pillaging and raping, and I'm fighting it as hard as I can.
[01:15:32.836 --> 01:15:33.876]  I really am, folks.
[01:15:35.117 --> 01:15:39.519]  And believe me, if you weren't out there fighting, things would be a lot worse.
[01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:45.261]  And you listen to enemy transmissions, they're going to tell you we're losing.
[01:15:45.502 --> 01:15:46.822]  They're going to tell you we don't have a hope.
[01:15:46.842 --> 01:15:48.083]  They're going to tell you you're crazy.
[01:15:48.303 --> 01:15:49.723]  They're going to tell you it's an urban legend.
[01:15:49.743 --> 01:15:51.184]  They're going to tell you none of this is happening.
[01:15:51.604 --> 01:15:52.645]  That's what enemies do.
[01:15:53.005 --> 01:15:53.805]  Everything's fine.
[01:15:53.845 --> 01:15:56.046]  Gee, I lay down or you won't see your sweetheart.
[01:15:56.346 --> 01:15:57.807]  Hey, you know what, Tokyo Rose?
[01:15:58.347 --> 01:16:00.008]  I can see that you're in trouble.
[01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:09.542]  We can find your dead programs and your dead operations, and I see this as a war, because it is a war, and I see your wreckage everywhere!
[01:16:09.782 --> 01:16:12.084]  Your dead are piling up around us!
[01:16:12.524 --> 01:16:18.488]  But it is literally a musket-swinging, hacking-slashing, last-ditch battle!
[01:16:18.749 --> 01:16:21.271]  And people are waking up, because the stuff's coming down!
[01:16:21.291 --> 01:16:24.973]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:16:25.554 --> 01:16:27.755]  Robert in Colorado, in Denver, and then we'll go to the others.
[01:16:27.796 --> 01:16:28.356]  Go ahead, Robert.
[01:16:29.685 --> 01:16:39.454]  I don't know how to follow that up, except to say the next time you come under fire, call the Flying Leathernecks.
[01:16:39.574 --> 01:16:40.795]  Good God, where do I start?
[01:16:41.256 --> 01:16:42.717]  The guy called in about a half hour ago.
[01:16:42.737 --> 01:16:46.081]  You may have talked about this last week, but please refresh me.
[01:16:46.381 --> 01:16:47.482]  I haven't heard your show in so long.
[01:16:48.056 --> 01:16:51.499]  What was your first reaction when you heard that Sandra Day O'Connor was hanging it up?
[01:16:51.539 --> 01:16:52.360]  How did you respond to that?
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:17:00.506]  I said, look out for Lord Gonzalez, the dark lord of torture and open borders and gun control and abortion, and we'll all be called liberals when we're against him.
[01:17:00.987 --> 01:17:01.947]  And that has now happened.
[01:17:02.408 --> 01:17:07.812]  Yeah, don't you think she was one of the more, if you can say this, open-minded jurists on the Supreme Court?
[01:17:07.852 --> 01:17:17.180]  Well, I think her decision was horrible in 1973 or 74 with Roe v. Wade, but she did rule and write the dissenting opinion against the land grabbing two weeks ago.
[01:17:17.600 --> 01:17:18.200]  Yes, he did.
[01:17:19.921 --> 01:17:25.542]  Certainly, take out some rancid pus and inject Beelzebub himself with a Gonzales.
[01:17:26.183 --> 01:17:28.003]  Throw him out of the fire into the ninth circle.
[01:17:29.624 --> 01:17:30.084]  Good analogy.
[01:17:30.104 --> 01:17:35.945]  What do you think about the two reporters that are once and for all going to jail because they won't give up their sources on the CIA lady?
[01:17:36.946 --> 01:17:39.726]  You know, it's horrible and it shows where free speech is going.
[01:17:39.766 --> 01:17:44.028]  I mean, it is a bedrock pillar that reporters have sources they don't have to disclose.
[01:17:44.208 --> 01:17:44.848]  I have sources.
[01:17:45.874 --> 01:17:51.898]  And they're not, and already there's been a chilling effect because they're afraid that I could be ordered to divulge sources.
[01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:58.962]  I mean, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany wouldn't let reporters have unnamed sources, and then America always has, and now they're trying to get rid of it.
[01:17:59.623 --> 01:17:59.983]  I agree.
[01:18:00.023 --> 01:18:01.424]  Well, I know you'll go down swinging.
[01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:04.225]  You'll never give up your story.
[01:18:04.546 --> 01:18:07.167]  It'll be a cold, it'll be a snowball chance in hell.
[01:18:07.187 --> 01:18:08.908]  I hear you, I hear you.
[01:18:09.509 --> 01:18:11.470]  Any idea of the next time you'll be on Coast to Coast?
[01:18:12.469 --> 01:18:14.751]  No, they have me on an average about every two months.
[01:18:14.871 --> 01:18:17.053]  Just tell them you'd like to hear me on by myself.
[01:18:17.533 --> 01:18:20.696]  Because George said he'd probably have me up by myself solo very soon.
[01:18:20.716 --> 01:18:23.358]  So probably September, October maybe?
[01:18:24.579 --> 01:18:25.520]  I don't know, ask him.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.581]  Okay, I may have to send him an email.
[01:18:27.822 --> 01:18:33.086]  Well once again, thanks to the professional on the last broadcast with that snail, Peter Lance.
[01:18:33.727 --> 01:18:35.188]  Uh, you really showed your professionalism.
[01:18:35.609 --> 01:18:36.229]  Well, thank you.
[01:18:36.269 --> 01:18:37.250]  You're doing good work.
[01:18:37.270 --> 01:18:38.591]  Yeah, keep up the good work Alexander.
[01:18:38.611 --> 01:18:39.412]  Thanks, you know, thank you.
[01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:40.413]  He's a lawyer.
[01:18:40.453 --> 01:18:42.414]  He tried to divert me with personal attacks.
[01:18:42.995 --> 01:18:44.136]  I'm not diverted by those.
[01:18:44.816 --> 01:18:46.838]  I've been attacked for over a decade, folks.
[01:18:46.878 --> 01:18:47.499]  I'm used to it.
[01:18:47.519 --> 01:18:48.359]  I got thick skin.
[01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.541]  I keep firing at the enemy.
[01:18:50.961 --> 01:18:51.982]  I don't get distracted.
[01:18:55.045 --> 01:18:57.387]  Hi folks, Jack Browner from Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.407 --> 01:18:58.708]  The real money folks.
[01:19:02.000 --> 01:19:03.921]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[01:19:04.421 --> 01:19:05.401]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:19:05.461 --> 01:19:06.862]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300.
[01:19:06.902 --> 01:19:07.342]  A 5% increase.
[01:19:07.922 --> 01:19:10.723]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro.
[01:19:10.743 --> 01:19:13.164]  A 24% decrease in spending power against a gold-backed euro.
[01:19:13.184 --> 01:19:14.305]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s.
[01:19:14.365 --> 01:19:15.365]  A 16% increase in real money.
[01:19:29.483 --> 01:19:32.524]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:19:33.085 --> 01:19:38.227]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:39.528 --> 01:19:43.449]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[01:19:44.130 --> 01:19:47.071]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[01:19:47.511 --> 01:19:48.932]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[01:19:53.550 --> 01:19:56.832]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:56.872 --> 01:20:01.054]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.314 --> 01:20:04.096]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.276 --> 01:20:06.677]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:06.877 --> 01:20:15.522]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.702 --> 01:20:17.063]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:20:17.243 --> 01:20:21.425]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:21.725 --> 01:20:22.045]  I think so.
[01:20:53.807 --> 01:20:56.248]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:56.969 --> 01:21:00.611]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[01:21:01.232 --> 01:21:05.134]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[01:21:05.815 --> 01:21:14.381]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[01:21:15.362 --> 01:21:22.564]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[01:21:23.464 --> 01:21:31.607]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:32.707 --> 01:21:35.588]  Just call our toll-free order line number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:35.608 --> 01:21:35.848]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:21:43.268 --> 01:21:43.868]  516-8736.
[01:21:44.729 --> 01:21:51.694]  Call now, our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:56.798]  Are you looking for a one-stop shop to find all your favorite books and videos?
[01:21:57.018 --> 01:21:57.918]  Look no further!
[01:21:58.179 --> 01:22:00.761]  Northern Voice Bookstore has everything you need.
[01:22:01.181 --> 01:22:09.627]  Hundreds of titles, from self-defense, survival, and financial freedom, to history, politics, conspiracy, and everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[01:22:09.827 --> 01:22:23.502]  You can order everything you need on the web 24 hours a day at NorthernVoiceBookstore.com or send $2 for our latest catalog to Northern Voice Bookstore, Post Office Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[01:22:24.163 --> 01:22:27.266]  Northern Voice Bookstore offers a broad range of different perspectives
[01:22:27.446 --> 01:22:27.706]  I'm good.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.381]  The New World Order is here.
[01:23:01.181 --> 01:23:01.802]  Do you like it?
[01:23:01.842 --> 01:23:03.562]  Do you smell the stench of death?
[01:23:04.503 --> 01:23:14.388]  Look, anybody who's denying we're in tyranny now, anybody that's denying they're setting up the last mechanisms of total enslavement, is just in total denial.
[01:23:15.548 --> 01:23:16.789]  And that's what I have to say to people.
[01:23:17.449 --> 01:23:19.931]  You know, if 10% of what we are saying is true, we're in trouble.
[01:23:19.971 --> 01:23:23.112]  And folks, I'm here to tell you, we've got about a 98% accuracy.
[01:23:23.913 --> 01:23:26.654]  We know the program, we track them, we live this fight.
[01:23:27.374 --> 01:23:28.455]  And we know what they're doing.
[01:23:29.013 --> 01:23:31.735]  And we're here to defend this country from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:23:31.995 --> 01:23:34.337]  And we know we're under attack, and we're defending.
[01:23:34.877 --> 01:23:38.160]  We're the American people, and the last stand of this nation.
[01:23:38.180 --> 01:23:47.507]  And we've got a chance to win with God's help, and we'll stop sucking our thumbs, and stop playing games, and get focused, and get mean, and get serious.
[01:23:48.548 --> 01:23:50.669]  Roger in Pennsylvania, then Scott, Kevin, Rick, and others.
[01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:51.310]  Go ahead, Roger.
[01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.060]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[01:23:53.140 --> 01:24:07.585]  Yeah, I'm sure that a lot, maybe a few of your listeners would know this, just a clarifying point, and that is that the Paul Harvey of 1967 is not the same Paul Harvey of today, so I call him Paul Hartley.
[01:24:08.745 --> 01:24:20.449]  And now, so that you know the rest of the story, something like about ten years ago, the baton passed from father to son, and it was really creepy because during the transitional period, when they were taking turns,
[01:24:21.007 --> 01:24:25.389]  You have to listen very carefully to tell they're two voices apart.
[01:24:26.189 --> 01:24:29.490]  I know his son does it a lot, and I wonder which Paul Harvey that was.
[01:24:29.970 --> 01:24:33.332]  Yeah, I'm sure it's all the fun for at least the last eight or so years.
[01:24:34.132 --> 01:24:39.494]  And, uh, now I can understand emulating one's father, but that is, uh, unnatural.
[01:24:39.534 --> 01:24:40.674]  But anyway, God bless.
[01:24:41.735 --> 01:24:42.955]  I will have to investigate that.
[01:24:42.995 --> 01:24:45.156]  I know it says on the website that the two of them do it.
[01:24:45.931 --> 01:24:48.152]  And I wonder if that's the same Paul Harvey.
[01:24:48.273 --> 01:24:51.054]  It was at the Sun, but it doesn't say.
[01:24:52.855 --> 01:24:58.739]  You couldn't hardly tell them apart at the time, so I expect that it's probably virtually all the Sun anymore.
[01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:00.420]  Interesting.
[01:25:00.480 --> 01:25:01.641]  I appreciate the call.
[01:25:02.061 --> 01:25:07.464]  I saw him on C-SPAN about three or four years ago, and he seemed chipper and intelligent, and said he was still doing it a lot of the time.
[01:25:08.405 --> 01:25:09.686]  So I don't know.
[01:25:10.106 --> 01:25:10.987]  I don't think it was the Sun.
[01:25:11.007 --> 01:25:11.547]  Who knows, though?
[01:25:12.498 --> 01:25:14.459]  Very sneaky, how you can't tell.
[01:25:14.639 --> 01:25:15.139]  That's a good point.
[01:25:15.579 --> 01:25:16.659]  Scott in Michigan.
[01:25:16.699 --> 01:25:17.639]  You're on the air, Scott.
[01:25:17.859 --> 01:25:18.400]  Alright, thank you Alex.
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:19.300]  How are you doing today, sir?
[01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:20.500]  Good, Scott.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:25.001]  Alright, I want to talk about today about the growing surveillance society, you know?
[01:25:25.021 --> 01:25:28.962]  Like the retina scanners, thumb scanners, implantable microchips.
[01:25:29.002 --> 01:25:31.803]  Yeah, retina scanners going in airports, high schools, yeah.
[01:25:32.483 --> 01:25:36.705]  Well, I live in a town between, I don't know, maybe 5,000, 9,000 people.
[01:25:36.765 --> 01:25:38.085]  I'm not really quite sure about the numbers.
[01:25:38.922 --> 01:25:55.113]  But just right over the bridge in our Twin City, the Marinette County Sheriff, which is our Twin City obviously, he said that they're bringing in retina scanners into that small town, and he did a very good propaganda too, and he said there'll be no money to the taxpayers whatsoever.
[01:25:55.133 --> 01:25:57.555]  Yeah, because Homeland Security's paying for it.
[01:25:57.835 --> 01:26:00.657]  Yes, and I was aware of that in that particular city.
[01:26:00.937 --> 01:26:06.541]  I talk more about the Surveillance Society, I give out more sources of the growing Surveillance Society,
[01:26:07.119 --> 01:26:09.841]  In my latest blog on teensforfreedom.blogsum.com.
[01:26:11.122 --> 01:26:12.143]  You said that so fast.
[01:26:12.203 --> 01:26:12.784]  What is it again?
[01:26:13.004 --> 01:26:15.306]  It's teensforfreedom.blogsum.com.
[01:26:15.606 --> 01:26:15.866]  Good.

[01:26:22.511 --> 01:26:22.692]  Okay.
[01:26:23.772 --> 01:26:27.255]  Okay, so you're going to log into that by... Your weekly, uh, plug, Scott.
[01:26:27.275 --> 01:26:28.216]  What else is on your mind?
[01:26:28.796 --> 01:26:31.939]  Well, I just, you know, give them a comment and... Good, yeah.
[01:26:32.800 --> 01:26:33.140]  That's it.
[01:26:33.635 --> 01:26:34.616]  Yeah, you want to see me more about it?
[01:26:34.636 --> 01:26:36.336]  I got three newspaper articles and their names.
[01:26:36.356 --> 01:26:37.477]  You want to look them up yourself.
[01:26:37.557 --> 01:26:38.417]  ID, chip system.
[01:26:39.078 --> 01:26:43.500]  And I talk more about it in the Growing Surveillance Society on my latest blog on my site, so.
[01:26:43.680 --> 01:26:44.701]  Good job, Scott.
[01:26:44.721 --> 01:26:45.341]  Good to hear from you.
[01:26:45.361 --> 01:26:45.881]  Keep it up.
[01:26:46.522 --> 01:26:47.282]  Keep firing.
[01:26:47.942 --> 01:26:49.503]  Let's talk to Kevin in Alabama.
[01:26:49.543 --> 01:26:50.383]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[01:26:50.804 --> 01:26:51.484]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[01:26:51.504 --> 01:26:51.984]  How you doing?
[01:26:52.104 --> 01:26:52.364]  Good.
[01:26:52.865 --> 01:26:57.447]  Hey, first and foremost, I want to thank you for waking me up about 9-11.
[01:26:57.767 --> 01:26:58.768]  I had no clue.
[01:26:59.088 --> 01:27:03.250]  I'll tell you, you need to thank Mr. Norrie, because that's how I found out about you.
[01:27:04.417 --> 01:27:07.278]  I know, it's great, it's only good that Norrie has me on.
[01:27:07.298 --> 01:27:11.679]  Yes sir, I'm a self-appointed General in the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:27:12.019 --> 01:27:13.860]  And I think that you're absolutely right.
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.921]  And I'm prepared to die over this.
[01:27:16.941 --> 01:27:18.761]  I don't know about you.
[01:27:19.921 --> 01:27:21.922]  Well you're in it sir, that means you're prepared to die.
[01:27:22.842 --> 01:27:25.603]  The way things are going, it's going downhill.
[01:27:25.823 --> 01:27:28.524]  I got another example of the Illuminati for y'all.
[01:27:29.204 --> 01:27:32.545]  Watch Fox News, don't pay no attention to the story.
[01:27:33.072 --> 01:27:35.592]  Look at the graphic.
[01:27:35.672 --> 01:27:37.313]  We have a story today about that.
[01:27:37.393 --> 01:27:39.453]  You turn the sound off and it's scary.
[01:27:39.973 --> 01:27:46.594]  Well no sir, I'm talking about there's spinning pyramids all over the screen.
[01:27:46.994 --> 01:27:49.215]  I know, I know.
[01:27:49.475 --> 01:27:59.677]  You know, you got that, you got CBS, I look on there, there's something where you can walk by a little machine and swipe your credit card, what's next?
[01:28:00.117 --> 01:28:00.957]  What's after that?
[01:28:01.517 --> 01:28:02.477]  Implants, man!
[01:28:03.197 --> 01:28:05.619]  I mean, people seriously need to wake up.
[01:28:05.639 --> 01:28:08.682]  9-11, I had no clue about it.
[01:28:09.502 --> 01:28:11.424]  For two years, I had no clue about it.
[01:28:11.724 --> 01:28:13.005]  I stumbled upon you.
[01:28:13.425 --> 01:28:15.347]  I said, man, this guy's full of it.
[01:28:15.667 --> 01:28:20.171]  I started calling CIA, FBI, American Airlines.
[01:28:20.731 --> 01:28:22.093]  Teller your phone numbers.
[01:28:22.733 --> 01:28:23.454]  Called it all.
[01:28:23.794 --> 01:28:24.294]  You're right.
[01:28:24.895 --> 01:28:25.836]  People need to wake up.
[01:28:26.456 --> 01:28:27.137]  Fight with us.
[01:28:27.177 --> 01:28:27.677]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:28:27.697 --> 01:28:28.998]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:28:29.238 --> 01:28:31.060]  What happened when you called these people?
[01:28:31.100 --> 01:28:32.201]  Stay there, Kevin.
[01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:34.711]  And we got a bunch of other audio clips.

[01:32:29.699 --> 01:32:32.120]  Well, basically, first and foremost, I said I was prepared to die.
[01:32:32.140 --> 01:32:33.481]  I'm not embarrassed.
[01:32:52.850 --> 01:32:55.431]  I don't plan on killing anybody, but I'm not backing down.
[01:32:55.571 --> 01:32:56.352]  That's what I thought.
[01:32:56.432 --> 01:32:59.754]  I mean, I got the idea that you thought I was lying and that you called them.
[01:32:59.774 --> 01:33:00.014]  No, sir.
[01:33:00.274 --> 01:33:00.734]  Understand.
[01:33:00.754 --> 01:33:01.414]  No, sir.
[01:33:01.514 --> 01:33:03.896]  I didn't think you was lying.
[01:33:04.196 --> 01:33:06.257]  I questioned it just like anybody should.
[01:33:06.417 --> 01:33:06.617]  Good.
[01:33:06.717 --> 01:33:07.377]  You should.
[01:33:07.578 --> 01:33:08.618]  I questioned what you said.
[01:33:08.838 --> 01:33:10.039]  So how did you research it?
[01:33:10.599 --> 01:33:12.120]  I just started calling everywhere.
[01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:12.940]  I called FBI.
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:14.541]  I called the White House.
[01:33:14.561 --> 01:33:16.522]  Well, how did calling them wake you up?
[01:33:17.102 --> 01:33:20.264]  Well, just asking them questions, you know?
[01:33:20.768 --> 01:33:23.810]  Just questions, you know.
[01:33:23.990 --> 01:33:33.436]  I call up every cell phone dealer and every one of them, well, 90% of them tell me you can't make phone calls in the air on a cell phone.
[01:33:33.476 --> 01:33:38.579]  Yeah, you can make them on the tarmac, but not at 30,000 feet going 500 miles an hour.
[01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:40.420]  That's one thing that sold me.
[01:33:40.580 --> 01:33:45.724]  I started the firefighter tapes that you got on your website.
[01:33:45.744 --> 01:33:48.225]  The firefighter stuff is undeniable.
[01:33:49.761 --> 01:33:52.526]  The FBI, they don't want to answer questions.
[01:33:52.546 --> 01:33:54.048]  Nobody wants to answer questions.
[01:33:54.849 --> 01:33:56.833]  American Airlines don't want to answer questions.
[01:33:56.853 --> 01:33:58.155]  Nobody wants to answer questions.
[01:33:58.896 --> 01:33:59.317]  I know this.
[01:33:59.417 --> 01:34:04.385]  I know somebody who works at a big airline in a pretty mid-level position.
[01:34:05.265 --> 01:34:16.134]  And one day he was walking around at Ostrom Bergstrom and literally like 20 different computer screens all had my website on it and all the people and security people were on the website going, Oh!
[01:34:17.015 --> 01:34:17.215]  Oh!
[01:34:17.235 --> 01:34:19.777]  Man, I want you on during the day.
[01:34:19.797 --> 01:34:21.879]  I want you on on FM station.
[01:34:21.919 --> 01:34:23.420]  I want you on where everybody.
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:25.402]  Oh yeah, I didn't even tell you this.
[01:34:25.602 --> 01:34:29.886]  I call this, I call this local sports slash political talk show.
[01:34:30.612 --> 01:34:34.655]  And, uh, all the time I talk about 9-11, I get dogged out, get dogged out.
[01:34:34.715 --> 01:34:44.942]  Anyway, uh, I've rattled their case so much that, uh, I got a senator or a governor on, you know, his last name's Bonner for Alabama.
[01:34:44.982 --> 01:34:46.423]  I think he's in the Senate or whatever.
[01:34:46.503 --> 01:34:48.725]  I got him asking about me, you know?
[01:34:49.005 --> 01:34:51.527]  So, I think what I'm doing is a good thing.
[01:34:51.887 --> 01:34:52.728]  I'm rattling their case.
[01:34:52.748 --> 01:34:55.490]  What, was he on the radio when you called in and he said, who is that?
[01:34:56.050 --> 01:34:57.471]  Well, uh, I called in one time.
[01:34:57.491 --> 01:34:58.212]  Who is that masked man?
[01:34:58.652 --> 01:34:59.913]  And they make fun of me, you know?
[01:35:00.734 --> 01:35:05.437]  They portrayed me as a nutcase because, like I said... But you know what's going to happen?
[01:35:05.477 --> 01:35:06.758]  Other people are going to hear you.
[01:35:06.798 --> 01:35:08.199]  They're going to check out the facts.
[01:35:08.219 --> 01:35:08.399]  Exactly.
[01:35:08.499 --> 01:35:10.040]  And they're going to wake up just like you.
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:10.180]  I know.
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:10.801]  That's what I'm doing.
[01:35:10.981 --> 01:35:12.182]  And that's why I take it.
[01:35:12.522 --> 01:35:17.445]  I take it on the chin so other people will know because it's the right thing to do.
[01:35:17.726 --> 01:35:21.228]  I hear you and I salute you and thank you so much for the call, my friend.
[01:35:21.248 --> 01:35:24.230]  You're doing a really great job, Kevin in Alabama.
[01:35:24.270 --> 01:35:27.312]  And let me just say this before we go to Debbie Morrow, who's holding patiently.
[01:35:27.332 --> 01:35:29.914]  I've got some really important information for you.
[01:35:31.946 --> 01:35:38.433]  After you've been attacked for a long, long, long, long, long, long, long time, it actually gets to be enjoyable.
[01:35:39.635 --> 01:35:42.077]  I know that sounds weird, but it means I'm doing my job.
[01:35:42.858 --> 01:35:46.362]  When I start taking fire, I know I'm getting close to the hot button.
[01:35:47.601 --> 01:35:56.983]  And, uh, the only time my feelings get hurt is when I'm just amazed by how greedy and envious and jealous other Patriot broadcasters of are me.
[01:35:57.324 --> 01:36:01.005]  People I've supported and promoted and then they turn around and attack me time and time again.
[01:36:01.565 --> 01:36:02.685]  That just saddens me.
[01:36:03.205 --> 01:36:06.606]  But that lets me know that a lot of them aren't in it to defeat the New World Order.
[01:36:06.626 --> 01:36:07.946]  It's some type of power trip.
[01:36:09.387 --> 01:36:14.228]  Believe me, folks, I enjoy fighting the New World Order, but I do it so much that, um,
[01:36:15.336 --> 01:36:21.780]  Just picking tomatoes in my backyard and watering my garden and hanging out with my family or going fishing.
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:27.884]  Just standing in the river with my feet on the pebbles.
[01:36:28.465 --> 01:36:33.228]  That is like heaven on earth compared to having to focus on these lies.
[01:36:34.448 --> 01:36:38.271]  So many times I've got a stack of news in front of me that's posted on the website and I don't even go over it.
[01:36:38.731 --> 01:36:41.073]  It's because I analyze it and focus on it.
[01:36:41.773 --> 01:36:43.094]  I get burnout sometimes.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.403]  And I just want to challenge all the Patriot broadcasters out there.
[01:36:47.423 --> 01:36:48.343]  You call yourselves Patriot.
[01:36:48.684 --> 01:36:49.664]  I'm really a truth seeker.
[01:36:49.704 --> 01:36:51.325]  I think the word Patriot limits us.
[01:36:53.187 --> 01:36:55.388]  I would challenge you to realize how serious all this is.
[01:36:55.408 --> 01:36:56.409]  We're losing this country.
[01:36:56.429 --> 01:36:58.010]  You're in danger from the New World Order.
[01:36:58.731 --> 01:37:03.855]  And I would challenge those individuals out there to get their heads screwed on straight.
[01:37:03.875 --> 01:37:05.596]  Some of them we know are feds.
[01:37:06.286 --> 01:37:08.887]  But regardless, folks, none of us should focus on that.
[01:37:09.347 --> 01:37:12.067]  We should focus on the New World Order and what they're doing.
[01:37:12.407 --> 01:37:15.848]  And focus on God to give us aid in our fight.
[01:37:15.888 --> 01:37:17.029]  To lead God and direct us.
[01:37:18.049 --> 01:37:18.569]  It's that simple.
[01:37:18.809 --> 01:37:20.429]  Before I go to Debbie, I said I'd mention this.
[01:37:20.449 --> 01:37:21.770]  I'm going to spend about two minutes on it.
[01:37:23.510 --> 01:37:24.931]  It is very, very important.
[01:37:25.751 --> 01:37:30.752]  It's a section of whistleblowers on presentplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:37:32.102 --> 01:37:36.444]  Because I've talked about these whistleblowers individually, but I really haven't talked about all of them together.
[01:37:38.425 --> 01:37:45.849]  We have the former Deputy Secretary of the Treasury, Paul Craig Roberts, going public and saying the official 9-11 story is a fraud.
[01:37:45.889 --> 01:37:47.750]  He's one of the most conservative people in America.
[01:37:48.171 --> 01:37:49.752]  Won all the big conservative awards.
[01:37:51.432 --> 01:37:59.797]  We have former Bush Cabinet member Morgan Reynolds, Chief Economist for the Department of Labor.
[01:38:01.013 --> 01:38:30.392]  going public saying that it's obviously the fourth uh... choice total government involvement in orchestration of the attacks former defense minister and technology minister Andres Bombulo went public and said you know total evidence of inside job it's the only way it can go the official stories of fraud Michael Meacher number three in the Blair government two and a half years ago resigned on the eve of the war and said it was a total fraud and that the war on terror was bogus and they either totally orchestrated it or funded it and had total Blair knowledge the attacks
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:40.283]  We have people like George Galloway, high level in the British government, coming on the show going, you know, I said, well look, looks like we'll carry out another attack to blame it on Iran.
[01:38:40.303 --> 01:38:42.843]  He said, yes, that's exactly what these monkeys do.
[01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:44.004]  That's exactly what they do.
[01:38:46.024 --> 01:38:50.726]  We have FBI agent Robert Wright going public and being threatened with arrest if he told people what he knew.
[01:38:51.086 --> 01:38:53.807]  He said, all I can tell you is the Bush's vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[01:38:55.416 --> 01:39:00.119]  We have former impeachment lawyer, Chief Counsel David Shippers coming on.
[01:39:00.159 --> 01:39:02.861]  You know, two weeks after the attack, saying they were all ordered to stand down.
[01:39:03.401 --> 01:39:09.645]  Former Bob Dole, Chief of Staff, Stanley Hilton, going public and saying they're involved in the attack and suing the government for it.
[01:39:11.326 --> 01:39:12.347]  And there's others, folks.
[01:39:12.827 --> 01:39:13.847]  I can't cover them all.
[01:39:14.108 --> 01:39:15.929]  But we're not alone.
[01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:19.111]  And more people are going public all the time.
[01:39:19.151 --> 01:39:19.371]  Listen.
[01:39:21.074 --> 01:39:27.316]  It was hard two months before 9-11 to say, call the White House, tell them don't attack the World Trade Centers and claim that Bin Laden did it.
[01:39:28.316 --> 01:39:29.456]  It was hard to take the heat.
[01:39:30.417 --> 01:39:34.318]  It was hard to have a lot of stations turn me off, a lot of stations that came back and picked me back up.
[01:39:34.398 --> 01:39:36.719]  We've got more stations than we did then, by the way.
[01:39:38.019 --> 01:39:41.280]  It was hard to be attacked by the Washington Post two weeks after 9-11.
[01:39:42.719 --> 01:39:44.622]  You know, for what I was saying about it.
[01:39:44.642 --> 01:39:48.869]  It was hard to be attacked by the ADL a week after 9-11 for what I was saying.
[01:39:49.350 --> 01:39:51.133]  But it put it on record that I was there.
[01:39:51.634 --> 01:39:52.897]  I hit the barbed wire first.
[01:39:53.017 --> 01:39:53.718]  I hit it hard.
[01:39:54.119 --> 01:39:55.201]  You could run over my back.
[01:39:56.010 --> 01:40:02.693]  And now we have smashed them, we have crushed them, we have taken many of their emplacements, we are laying waste to their frauds.
[01:40:03.353 --> 01:40:10.096]  That doesn't mean we've won the war though, folks, but we are definitely engaging the enemy, we are indefinitely smashing and killing their lives.
[01:40:10.636 --> 01:40:12.857]  We are having so many victories, it's unbelievable.
[01:40:13.938 --> 01:40:16.079]  Alright, so that's all I've got to say on that subject.
[01:40:16.099 --> 01:40:21.281]  Debbie Morrow, thanks for holding the last 6-7 minutes, I appreciate you coming on, my dear.
[01:40:21.301 --> 01:40:23.182]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me.
[01:40:24.179 --> 01:40:29.063]  Made in America, the Big Berkey and the Black Berkey Elements.
[01:40:29.624 --> 01:40:32.506]  You also have the Made in England units available if folks want that.
[01:40:32.526 --> 01:40:37.671]  But you also have your own Made in America Big Berkey with the stainless steel with the Black Berkey Elements in it.
[01:40:37.711 --> 01:40:40.313]  You also have the see-through system.
[01:40:41.114 --> 01:40:44.337]  You've got sports bottles that clean the water and make it safe.
[01:40:44.397 --> 01:40:46.979]  It doesn't cut everything out like the Big Berkeys with the Black Elements.
[01:40:47.512 --> 01:40:48.933]  You've got a bunch of different specials.
[01:40:48.994 --> 01:40:50.235]  We had you on a few weeks ago.
[01:40:50.255 --> 01:40:54.139]  And I guess you're still offering the insane special of what?
[01:40:54.819 --> 01:40:56.201]  $225, I believe?
[01:40:56.501 --> 01:41:00.685]  For the giant 3-filter stainless steel element system?
[01:41:01.426 --> 01:41:02.126]  Right.
[01:41:02.447 --> 01:41:08.232]  That special there is only available until we run out.
[01:41:09.814 --> 01:41:11.936]  And it's a 3-gallon
[01:41:12.793 --> 01:41:16.934]  Stainless steel unit with two white ceramic imperial filters in it.
[01:41:17.054 --> 01:41:22.395]  But you also have a new deal on the stainless steel with black Berkey elements, right?
[01:41:22.855 --> 01:41:32.878]  Yes we do, and it's so exciting that we finally have the stainless steel system available with black filters in it.
[01:41:33.798 --> 01:41:38.739]  I've had lots of people in the past ask me if we could come out with a product that does that.
[01:41:39.668 --> 01:41:43.271]  And it was a long time coming, but we finally came up with one.
[01:41:43.291 --> 01:41:59.085]  Well, I bought quite a few as gifts, and of course for myself, the clear units, then I have backups in the garage, but I've also given quite a few of the clear units as a gift, but I also own a couple of stainless steel units, and the stainless steel is just so beautiful in your kitchen, about two feet tall, you've got different sizes,
[01:42:00.387 --> 01:42:00.787]  So easy.
[01:42:00.807 --> 01:42:02.650]  It takes about a minute and a half to put together, folks.
[01:42:03.231 --> 01:42:06.055]  And the water is so full of poisons and toxins.
[01:42:06.115 --> 01:42:09.379]  And Debbie, a lot of folks have been listening to you and Jim Shepard on the broadcast.
[01:42:09.419 --> 01:42:11.462]  What, you've been sponsoring me for like four years now?
[01:42:12.123 --> 01:42:12.183]  Yes.
[01:42:12.284 --> 01:42:15.729]  And people have never heard me say this until lately because it's true.
[01:42:16.329 --> 01:42:19.391]  I've never seen you guys discount at this level.
[01:42:19.471 --> 01:42:25.334]  A two-gallon Indian or Chinese knockoff is $300 to $325 at the camping supply.
[01:42:25.674 --> 01:42:27.675]  You've got systems that hold a gallon more.
[01:42:27.715 --> 01:42:31.537]  You've got systems that have got better black elements for $225.
[01:42:32.118 --> 01:42:35.239]  I mean, this is just an incredible deal.
[01:42:36.460 --> 01:42:38.381]  Yes, it really is.
[01:42:38.921 --> 01:42:41.063]  We've had lots of people respond to it.
[01:42:41.103 --> 01:42:43.104]  We wanted to make it available for people
[01:42:44.062 --> 01:42:51.608]  out there who really want the stainless steel unit but can't afford $315 for the Big Berkey?
[01:42:53.929 --> 01:42:55.551]  Well, it's made in America.
[01:42:55.591 --> 01:42:57.992]  The stainless steel unit, the clear unit, the black elements.
[01:42:58.032 --> 01:43:02.976]  If you want one of the British units, they've got those as well.
[01:43:03.837 --> 01:43:08.140]  But this is the premier system out there.
[01:43:08.180 --> 01:43:09.601]  It's what I chose to use.
[01:43:10.854 --> 01:43:11.514]  Not with that one for $225.
[01:43:11.574 --> 01:43:12.655]  Their free gift is at the bank.
[01:43:31.906 --> 01:43:45.996]  We don't have any sport bottles available with that one, but we still have the Berkey Lights with the free sport bottles and the Berkey Lights with the lights for, you know, you get the sport bottle and auxiliary battery adapter and things like that.
[01:43:46.416 --> 01:43:49.898]  So, we do have lots of really good Alex Jones specials available.
[01:43:50.038 --> 01:43:59.265]  Well, Debbie, for those that don't know, I just am so proud to not promote magic cures and
[01:44:00.258 --> 01:44:02.887]  Uh, you know, uh, you know, magic, new age, garbage.
[01:44:03.909 --> 01:44:10.251]  I am so honored to be able to have a straight and pure broadcast with water filters, documentary films, books.
[01:44:10.691 --> 01:44:12.172]  That's how we support this broadcast.
[01:44:12.232 --> 01:44:13.472]  It's made in America.
[01:44:13.892 --> 01:44:15.172]  It's the highest quality.
[01:44:15.212 --> 01:44:18.453]  It's what I chose to use after months of research back in 1999.
[01:44:19.354 --> 01:44:21.654]  And it's what I'm still using to this day.
[01:44:21.694 --> 01:44:23.115]  We cook with reverse osmosis.
[01:44:23.155 --> 01:44:24.275]  We drink out of Berkey's.
[01:44:24.995 --> 01:44:27.336]  And it is just such a great system.
[01:44:27.776 --> 01:44:29.657]  Give Debbie a call right now.
[01:44:29.757 --> 01:44:31.217]  If the phones are busy, leave your name and number.
[01:44:31.237 --> 01:44:33.318]  She'll call you right back or one of her helpers will.
[01:44:34.404 --> 01:44:34.724]  1-888-803-4438.
[01:44:34.744 --> 01:44:36.345]  888-803-4438.
[01:44:36.485 --> 01:44:44.328]  If you're listening in a rebroadcast at night, call, leave your name and number.
[01:44:44.648 --> 01:44:45.508]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:44:45.528 --> 01:44:48.789]  She'll give you a call back tomorrow.
[01:44:48.809 --> 01:44:49.310]  888-803-4438.
[01:44:49.410 --> 01:44:53.731]  Or murkywater.com or order the filters off Infowars.com.
[01:44:53.751 --> 01:44:54.692]  We have a link there as well.
[01:44:55.072 --> 01:44:57.553]  Debbie, I gotta tell you, I mean, again, it feels good.
[01:44:57.713 --> 01:44:59.674]  I know the water's full of toxins and poison.
[01:44:59.994 --> 01:45:00.914]  The government admits it.
[01:45:01.374 --> 01:45:03.395]  Why are you still giving it to your family, folks?
[01:45:04.015 --> 01:45:06.556]  It feels good to badger people to pitch this.
[01:45:06.736 --> 01:45:07.596]  Made in America.
[01:45:07.956 --> 01:45:09.477]  Makes the broadcast possible.
[01:45:10.197 --> 01:45:11.978]  Supports industry in this country.
[01:45:12.358 --> 01:45:13.718]  It feels good.
[01:45:13.998 --> 01:45:18.239]  And folks, it'll feel even better when you drink a big luscious glass of murky water.
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:21.400]  And after a month on this water, try to go back to your tap.
[01:45:21.440 --> 01:45:22.481]  You won't believe it.
[01:45:23.281 --> 01:45:24.862]  You know, you get used to drinking this stuff.
[01:45:24.882 --> 01:45:27.722]  It's like you get used to, I guess, drinking whiskey to the bad taste.
[01:45:27.742 --> 01:45:29.683]  You know, drinking normal tap is a joke.
[01:45:29.883 --> 01:45:31.203]  Debbie, they should call you, shouldn't they?
[01:45:33.217 --> 01:45:34.778]  I couldn't hear what you just said, Alex.
[01:45:35.238 --> 01:45:37.379]  What was the last thing you just said?
[01:45:37.459 --> 01:45:39.800]  No, I was just saying, I heard your phone cut out there for a second.
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:44.061]  I just said that it feels good to promote something that is so good and made in America.
[01:45:44.441 --> 01:45:45.042]  Absolutely!
[01:45:45.082 --> 01:46:01.508]  You know, I have worked for New Millennium now since 1998 or maybe the beginning of 1999 and working for a company that you really believe in makes such a difference and one thing I did want to share with the people out there
[01:46:02.974 --> 01:46:17.087]  Yesterday in my mail I received a report from my water district and it lists every single thing that they say is in the water and what the contaminant levels are and how much we're allowed to have in it.
[01:46:17.814 --> 01:46:23.556]  And I believe that if they call their water district, they can get a copy of these kind of reports sent to them.
[01:46:23.576 --> 01:46:26.518]  You can actually get it online for the local water authority.
[01:46:26.538 --> 01:46:31.840]  Yeah, and you can see what's really in your water and why you want to have a Berkey water filter.
[01:46:31.860 --> 01:46:34.741]  Just type Timbuktu Water District in and you'll get it.
[01:46:34.761 --> 01:46:38.623]  Then you'll go to Water Contaminant Reports and then you can get that.
[01:46:38.943 --> 01:46:39.163]  Uh huh.
[01:46:39.975 --> 01:46:48.961]  Yeah, and it's got some really good information on here, and after reading these reports, you'll really understand why it's so important to get a Berkey water filter.
[01:46:48.981 --> 01:46:49.901]  Oh, it's an urban legend.
[01:46:49.921 --> 01:46:52.843]  The water's delicious, and it's full of wonder, and mercury's good for you, Debbie.
[01:46:53.203 --> 01:46:54.784]  Debbie, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:46:55.025 --> 01:46:56.866]  Thank you very much for having me, Alex.
[01:46:56.886 --> 01:46:57.386]  Take care.
[01:46:57.406 --> 01:46:58.567]  Always good to have you on with us.
[01:46:58.587 --> 01:46:59.527]  I haven't been on in a few weeks.
[01:46:59.567 --> 01:47:02.769]  Toll-free number to call her, 888-803-4438.
[01:47:03.210 --> 01:47:06.772]  And I'm done talking about it for the next week or so, but you're crazy if you don't call.
[01:47:07.252 --> 01:47:08.173]  It's really that simple.
[01:47:09.347 --> 01:47:10.308]  Take control of your life.
[01:47:10.568 --> 01:47:12.729]  Let's go back to the calls and there's just tons of news coming up.
[01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:16.252]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rick and Reno.
[01:47:17.272 --> 01:47:25.918]  On this occasion of the 59th birthday of Bush, I suggest that we keep the heat on him and howl him to justice.
[01:47:26.479 --> 01:47:27.960]  Our emperor has had a birthday.
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:33.123]  Him-wittedness is no excuse or exoneration from guilt and punishment.
[01:47:33.203 --> 01:47:38.867]  Lord knows Bush 43 had enough mentally retarded executed in Texas.
[01:47:40.566 --> 01:47:41.166]  Well, that's true.
[01:47:41.206 --> 01:47:41.927]  That's their favorite.
[01:47:43.008 --> 01:47:44.629]  They'll get on TV and make fun of him.
[01:47:44.849 --> 01:47:46.410]  Please, please don't kill me.
[01:47:47.371 --> 01:47:48.672]  Please don't, please.
[01:47:48.992 --> 01:47:50.273]  And his eyes started gleaming.
[01:47:51.013 --> 01:47:51.994]  You ever seen that video?
[01:47:52.534 --> 01:47:52.694]  No.
[01:47:54.235 --> 01:47:54.856]  Pretty scary.
[01:47:55.996 --> 01:48:01.480]  Also, uh, on June 19th, June 17th, pardon me, 1972, the Watergate burglars were arrested.
[01:48:07.677 --> 01:48:19.666]  And by July 27th of 74, the House Judiciary Committee had passed the three articles of impeachment against Nixon, and by August 8th of 74, he had resigned.
[01:48:19.686 --> 01:48:33.475]  And my mother tells the stories of, you know, she was at home the first two years, I was really little, and so I was at home, I was about two, and I was like, you know, a baby, and I would just watch for hours the Watergate hearings.
[01:48:34.036 --> 01:48:37.018]  She thinks that's how I can, today, enjoy watching C-SPAN,
[01:48:38.131 --> 01:48:40.433]  I remember sitting before them for hours myself.
[01:48:40.533 --> 01:48:41.053]  I remember.
[01:48:41.213 --> 01:48:42.474]  I was in high school at the time.
[01:48:42.814 --> 01:48:52.140]  Now, so Karl Rove, he is the Watergate burglar of today and we need to keep the pressure on.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:58.564]  What he did was much worse than breaking into an office to get some stuff on a psychiatrist patient.
[01:48:59.064 --> 01:49:00.565]  Oh yeah, he's a treasonous.
[01:49:00.725 --> 01:49:06.709]  I mean, blowing out the names of a spy chief with, they say, over 200 people under and death did result.
[01:49:07.629 --> 01:49:08.850]  That is very serious.
[01:49:10.452 --> 01:49:11.673]  You're doing a great job, man.
[01:49:12.514 --> 01:49:12.794]  Take care.
[01:49:12.834 --> 01:49:14.496]  Anything else you want to say about Karl Rove?
[01:49:14.636 --> 01:49:18.280]  Did you get my point, though, in the last hour about how we just burned Rove?
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:20.722]  I mean, these guys are just puppets themselves.
[01:49:21.042 --> 01:49:22.423]  The whole agenda will keep going?
[01:49:22.664 --> 01:49:23.044]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:23.264 --> 01:49:25.506]  I think we need to keep on prying open the whole...
[01:49:29.429 --> 01:49:34.954]  Yeah, I don't want to have it turn into a spectacle, a lynching that then diverts off of all the other issues.
[01:49:35.294 --> 01:49:41.600]  Yeah, we need to keep on going because the top is as guilty as the bottom and the top needs to go down also.
[01:49:42.281 --> 01:49:45.724]  Well, my point is that Bush is at the end all be all of power.
[01:49:46.245 --> 01:49:49.528]  Well, maybe we can get some higher-ups above Bush to take care of it.
[01:49:49.808 --> 01:49:50.128]  I agree.
[01:49:50.168 --> 01:49:51.930]  It'll probably be the higher-ups that are releasing all this.
[01:49:54.514 --> 01:50:01.902]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.162 --> 01:50:06.907]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.127 --> 01:50:12.812]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.013 --> 01:50:13.353]  Witnessing
[01:50:13.373 --> 01:50:14.013]  We're good to go.
[01:50:38.439 --> 01:50:38.879]  We're good to go.
[01:50:54.987 --> 01:51:06.233]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:51:06.453 --> 01:51:12.917]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:51:13.177 --> 01:51:13.817]  We're good to go!
[01:51:36.192 --> 01:51:38.294]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:51:38.494 --> 01:51:43.759]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:44.059 --> 01:51:50.385]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:50.485 --> 01:51:51.766]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:52.825 --> 01:51:55.187]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:51:55.447 --> 01:51:59.290]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:51:59.610 --> 01:52:00.411]  Read the labels.
[01:52:00.851 --> 01:52:04.974]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:52:05.194 --> 01:52:09.377]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:52:09.757 --> 01:52:14.641]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:52:15.021 --> 01:52:18.583]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:52:18.784 --> 01:52:24.127]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:52:24.407 --> 01:52:27.129]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:52:27.429 --> 01:52:28.330]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:52:28.630 --> 01:52:39.357]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[01:53:02.006 --> 01:53:06.087]  I want to get more into Alberto Gonzalez and whoever our new Supreme Court Justice is going to be.
[01:53:06.107 --> 01:53:07.968]  And of course, Rehnquist is getting ready to leave.
[01:53:08.849 --> 01:53:11.351]  I want to get into military expense, homeland security efforts.
[01:53:12.312 --> 01:53:15.874]  And folks, I mean this is just the end of posse commentatus right in front of us.
[01:53:16.995 --> 01:53:27.843]  There's another one, New York Times, Pentagon directs attention to domestic warfare, Bush administration annexes the internet, forget cameras, spy device will cut driver speed by satellite, oil will hit $100 by winter.
[01:53:27.963 --> 01:53:29.744]  I'm not saying that, the observer is.
[01:53:30.665 --> 01:53:32.566]  America's buying more guns, sales up by 11%.
[01:53:34.878 --> 01:53:39.181]  I've just got a huge stack here, but we will take a ton of your calls in the next hour.

[01:54:02.964 --> 01:54:04.924]  I'm going to spend 30 seconds on this and go to your calls.

[01:54:23.388 --> 01:54:24.368]  You've seen the rest.
[01:54:24.528 --> 01:54:25.748]  Now here's the best, folks.
[01:54:26.528 --> 01:54:27.808]  Let's go to Tim in Ohio.
[01:54:27.848 --> 01:54:28.788]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:54:29.049 --> 01:54:29.669]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:54:29.789 --> 01:54:30.509]  I have a few things for you.
[01:54:30.549 --> 01:54:31.449]  I promised to be brief.
[01:54:32.085 --> 01:54:32.445]  Welcome.
[01:54:32.686 --> 01:54:35.628]  Yesterday's show, when you had Mr. Bannister on.
[01:54:36.269 --> 01:54:44.475]  Yes, the former Treasury agent assigned to the IRS, criminal investigator, going public about the fraud of the IRS, so they arrested him, charged him, and the jury found him not guilty.
[01:54:44.876 --> 01:54:45.496]  Excellent show.
[01:54:45.596 --> 01:54:46.357]  Thanks for the review.
[01:54:46.597 --> 01:54:48.759]  Here's my idea, and I was thinking about this.
[01:54:49.079 --> 01:54:58.587]  The AH, I'm sorry, the IRS, uses all types, or they have all types of pawn companies working for them, like all of these tax preparing organizations.
[01:54:59.448 --> 01:55:00.509]  HR Block, whatever all.
[01:55:01.536 --> 01:55:09.362]  Is it possible that we could get a class action lawsuit going against these types of companies using that case as a basis?
[01:55:11.524 --> 01:55:12.965]  You know, that's an interesting idea.
[01:55:12.985 --> 01:55:14.666]  But that would be hypocritical.
[01:55:14.746 --> 01:55:20.531]  I mean, I pay income taxes even though it's a fraud just because that's not the battle I've chosen to fight.
[01:55:20.931 --> 01:55:21.151]  Right.
[01:55:21.371 --> 01:55:23.933]  And I don't make a ton of money so I don't pay that much.
[01:55:26.674 --> 01:55:36.822]  I mean, I think people that aren't going along with the fraud do have a right to, especially if you've been filing with these people and you find out that's a scam, that you could sue them.
[01:55:38.023 --> 01:55:48.412]  We have to get those lawyers back on and maybe we could talk to them next time about that, because I thought that would be a really good way to start putting... Well, what's happening is tax preparers are finding out the truth and the IRS is panicking.
[01:55:48.452 --> 01:55:50.013]  We have their internal memos.
[01:55:50.313 --> 01:55:50.493]  Right.
[01:55:50.813 --> 01:55:53.876]  Now, yesterday, too, you also talked about the 16th Amendment.
[01:55:54.597 --> 01:55:55.718]  And it was ratified?
[01:55:56.898 --> 01:55:58.899]  Never ratified.
[01:55:59.039 --> 01:56:01.240]  And it didn't even get close.
[01:56:01.321 --> 01:56:02.861]  I mean, the government said it was ratified.
[01:56:02.881 --> 01:56:07.544]  You go to the official votes with the Secretary of State and it shows that it wasn't ratified.
[01:56:07.784 --> 01:56:12.086]  Going back to 1863, though, during the Civil War, didn't half of the Congress walk out?
[01:56:12.166 --> 01:56:15.548]  And it never really convened under common law, so it was under
[01:56:16.168 --> 01:56:17.869]  Uh, martial law and executive orders?
[01:56:17.949 --> 01:56:18.389]  Exactly!
[01:56:18.429 --> 01:56:19.989]  It was just under the force of a gun.
[01:56:20.029 --> 01:56:20.870]  That's what it's all about.
[01:56:21.050 --> 01:56:22.890]  Right, so in that case... That's admiralty!
[01:56:23.170 --> 01:56:27.112]  So in that case, it doesn't matter if the 16th Amendment is ratified or not, does it?
[01:56:27.132 --> 01:56:29.513]  They get you either way there because they say we're under martial law.
[01:56:29.553 --> 01:56:30.813]  Look, it isn't even about law now.
[01:56:30.873 --> 01:56:33.334]  It's about... We got guys that work with black masks.
[01:56:33.354 --> 01:56:34.314]  We got a gang of killers.
[01:56:34.574 --> 01:56:35.755]  They'll kill whoever we say.
[01:56:36.015 --> 01:56:37.595]  We'll take you to one of our giant prisons.
[01:56:37.815 --> 01:56:38.256]  Shut up!
[01:56:38.296 --> 01:56:39.096]  You're our slaves!
[01:56:39.236 --> 01:56:40.276]  Right.
[01:56:40.336 --> 01:56:41.917]  Okay, uh, change subject here real quick.
[01:56:42.277 --> 01:56:45.318]  This Aruba story, this missing teenager, um,
[01:56:46.542 --> 01:56:49.745]  Last night on Fox News, Greta Van Susteren was interviewing the parents.
[01:57:03.726 --> 01:57:07.668]  They put their fingerprint on it, like they always love to do.
[01:57:07.928 --> 01:57:10.949]  I got the video, I'll try to give you a, get a copy in the mail by the weekend.
[01:57:10.969 --> 01:57:12.110]  Let me put their fingerprint on it.
[01:57:12.370 --> 01:57:15.711]  They had, out of all the places to interview, the mother and the father.
[01:57:15.811 --> 01:57:21.454]  Right behind them, in the background, was a big brown pyramid with the capstone missing.
[01:57:21.594 --> 01:57:27.116]  And all Fox News programs end their show with the copyright, New World Communication, on the local level.
[01:57:28.797 --> 01:57:30.678]  I know, it's sick symbolism everywhere.
[01:57:30.698 --> 01:57:31.458]  Send me that video.
[01:57:31.538 --> 01:57:31.899]  Okay, Al.
[01:57:33.837 --> 01:57:38.083]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.123 --> 01:57:38.403]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.252 --> 01:57:52.312]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.032 --> 01:57:54.113]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.773 --> 01:57:55.653]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.353 --> 01:57:57.233]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.754 --> 01:58:01.835]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.115 --> 01:58:06.276]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.417 --> 01:58:14.938]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, it is Wednesday, the sixth day of July 2005.
[01:58:16.558 --> 01:58:19.819]  Already into the third hour, checker three,
[01:58:21.303 --> 01:58:27.067]  We're going to be taking your calls throughout this hour on any issue you wish to discuss and masses of news and information.
[01:58:28.368 --> 01:58:37.955]  You want to talk about Paul Harvey's comments about how black slavery is good in America, handing out smallpox blankets is good, nuking the Middle East is good.
[01:58:37.975 --> 01:58:40.738]  This is mass sick mental illness.
[01:58:41.898 --> 01:58:42.919]  Then you're welcome to call in.
[01:58:42.939 --> 01:58:44.801]  We'll talk about Alberto Gonzalez.
[01:58:44.821 --> 01:58:50.365]  We're now being called liberals in support against him being the new Supreme Court Justice and Bush's chastises.
[01:58:50.985 --> 01:58:52.006]  Not to criticize him.
[01:58:52.026 --> 01:58:55.188]  If you want to get into other announcements, the military is going to be involved with police.
[01:58:55.569 --> 01:58:57.911]  The local level to keep us safe, but not on the border.
[01:58:58.331 --> 01:58:59.732]  The end of positive comment taught us.
[01:58:59.752 --> 01:59:00.072]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:00.092 --> 01:59:00.392]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:59:00.412 --> 01:59:00.953]  James in Michigan.
[01:59:01.013 --> 01:59:02.054]  James, you're on the air.
[01:59:02.074 --> 01:59:02.254]  Go ahead.
[01:59:02.314 --> 01:59:02.674]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:12.853 --> 01:59:13.113]  Yes.
[01:59:13.494 --> 01:59:22.040]  Yes, I was just, I wanted to tell you, I'm over here, I went out this morning to get gasoline, they raised the price 24 cents a gallon today.
[01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:32.987]  Well, they're saying that it is going to hit $100 a barrel by winter, and what did we tell you two and a half months ago out of the Bilderberg Group with our spies meeting in Europe?
[01:59:33.548 --> 01:59:35.949]  Kissinger says it's going up to what, $150 a barrel?
[01:59:35.990 --> 01:59:36.970]  Did you know that four years ago,
[01:59:41.624 --> 01:59:44.146]  Four years ago, oil was $10 a barrel.
[01:59:45.727 --> 01:59:45.948]  Right.
[01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:53.474]  Okay, now today, well another thing I was going to tell you, they're putting more, I'm over here by a state highway.
[01:59:54.635 --> 01:59:57.937]  As I drive the state highway, I notice they put three more cameras up.
[01:59:59.259 --> 02:00:04.383]  Homeland Security's paying for it, and the military admits it is a military model, a control grid.
[02:00:05.143 --> 02:00:05.804]  A control grid.
[02:00:06.354 --> 02:00:08.496]  Yeah, they put it out in major publications.
[02:00:08.716 --> 02:00:10.217]  It's a domestic control grid.
[02:00:10.718 --> 02:00:14.521]  Well, now that we have every Friday, we have the state police.
[02:00:15.261 --> 02:00:17.883]  They have what they call random checks on the highway.
[02:00:18.023 --> 02:00:19.044]  Federally funded again.
[02:00:19.124 --> 02:00:21.026]  Yes, training and there's no fourth amendment.
[02:00:21.206 --> 02:00:24.829]  You don't have to be speeding for them to pull you over if they figure that you look suspicious.
[02:00:24.909 --> 02:00:25.630]  It's not even that.
[02:00:25.650 --> 02:00:27.291]  They just randomly do it, sir.
[02:00:28.232 --> 02:00:30.934]  There's an invasion of our freedom right there.
[02:00:31.494 --> 02:00:32.695]  But the border's wide open.
[02:00:32.775 --> 02:00:34.757]  And look, they're going to have troops with them soon.
[02:00:35.723 --> 02:00:46.509]  Look, I got video from the late 90's of troops going to drills and then stopping real cars, you know, non-role players and arresting them with the police, you know, searching cars.
[02:00:46.810 --> 02:00:47.290]  That's right.
[02:00:47.370 --> 02:00:50.171]  Well, you know, the thing is, it's an honor to have you out there.
[02:00:50.231 --> 02:00:57.155]  I mean, you know, to have you broadcasting, we still have that freedom of broadcasting and I pray every day that we don't lose that.
[02:00:57.736 --> 02:01:03.199]  Because if we don't get the message out to the people and people don't wake up, I mean, just like you say, we see it slowly eroding.
[02:01:03.942 --> 02:01:05.313]  We're not gonna have any freedom at all!
[02:01:06.075 --> 02:01:08.536]  Well, it's like a sandcastle when the waves start hitting it.
[02:01:08.576 --> 02:01:11.977]  At first, it doesn't fall, and the waves hit, and then just suddenly it collapses.
[02:01:12.497 --> 02:01:14.257]  I mean, we've hit the flashpoint, sir.
[02:01:14.277 --> 02:01:16.098]  It's like a piece of paper in the fire.
[02:01:16.118 --> 02:01:18.498]  You throw it in, it doesn't ignite for a second, then it bursts.
[02:01:19.059 --> 02:01:20.039]  America burst.
[02:01:20.139 --> 02:01:21.339]  I mean, it's happening.
[02:01:21.419 --> 02:01:28.401]  But, we can snatch victory from the jaws of defeat, as they say, because right now, I mean, the tyranny's right out in the open.
[02:01:28.441 --> 02:01:35.203]  The mask is off, the cards are on the table, the big dog's off the porch, and I mean, anybody denying what's happening now,
[02:01:35.823 --> 02:01:37.424]  He's willfully in denial.
[02:01:37.464 --> 02:01:40.486]  They are in purposeful self-denial.
[02:01:41.346 --> 02:01:46.530]  Well, then, too, another thing that I'll tell you about Junior is Junior doesn't actually run this country.
[02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:50.932]  His father and the cronies are actually behind a lot of this New World Order.
[02:01:50.952 --> 02:01:55.395]  Because if you remember back in 1990 when Senior... A New World Order!
[02:01:55.515 --> 02:01:57.276]  ...talked about the New World Order back in 1990.
[02:01:57.316 --> 02:01:59.677]  We can see a New World Order coming into view.
[02:02:00.258 --> 02:02:02.399]  We have the very real chance of a New World Order.
[02:02:04.165 --> 02:02:05.825]  I know those are in my clip files.
[02:02:05.846 --> 02:02:06.806]  I used to play them years ago.
[02:02:06.846 --> 02:02:09.587]  I also know they're in some of the other talk show host clip files.
[02:02:10.008 --> 02:02:13.029]  Find me the George Bush Senior New World Order clips, Scott.
[02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:16.271]  If we can find them, we'll play those in the next segment.
[02:02:17.231 --> 02:02:18.212]  Alright, thank you, James.
[02:02:18.232 --> 02:02:18.572]  Thank you.
[02:02:19.313 --> 02:02:19.713]  You bet.
[02:02:19.953 --> 02:02:26.096]  Oh, by the way, coming up, everybody keeps talking about Matt Lauer a week and a half ago, Tom Cruise on it.
[02:02:26.136 --> 02:02:29.658]  We never got to this clip about the brave new world of drugging.
[02:02:30.498 --> 02:02:33.422]  We're going to play that coming up too in the next hour, so look forward to that.
[02:02:33.702 --> 02:02:37.106]  We'll probably replay that Paul Harvey, a little two-minute clip to analyze it as well.
[02:02:37.587 --> 02:02:42.093]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, Infowars.net are just some of the sites.

[02:02:46.636 --> 02:02:49.498]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.758 --> 02:02:51.319]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:56.343]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.683 --> 02:03:01.147]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.547 --> 02:03:05.710]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:05.930 --> 02:03:08.771]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.871 --> 02:03:13.534]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.734 --> 02:03:18.096]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.376 --> 02:03:25.600]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:28.281]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.441 --> 02:03:30.182]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:55.705 --> 02:04:06.931]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.271 --> 02:04:12.994]  Nitrates, Nitrites, Radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like Lead, Mercury, and Aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.234 --> 02:04:19.879]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.099 --> 02:04:26.924]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.

[02:04:45.078 --> 02:04:47.440]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:47.700 --> 02:04:51.543]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:04:51.864 --> 02:04:52.664]  Read the labels.
[02:04:53.105 --> 02:04:57.228]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:57.448 --> 02:05:01.632]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:02.012 --> 02:05:06.896]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:07.256 --> 02:05:10.838]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:05:11.039 --> 02:05:16.362]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[02:05:34.494 --> 02:05:35.835]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:35.855 --> 02:05:37.156]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.880 --> 02:05:58.228]  Alright, the last two hours I've been mentioning it, so I'll go ahead and detail it in four or five minutes.
[02:05:58.689 --> 02:06:01.393]  Then we'll go to Vince, William, and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:06:01.854 --> 02:06:04.478]  Call the free number to join us on this live Wednesday edition, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:09.500 --> 02:06:11.921]  Military expands homeland efforts.
[02:06:11.981 --> 02:06:13.441]  This is out of the Washington Post.
[02:06:13.901 --> 02:06:16.782]  Pentagon to share data with civilian agencies.
[02:06:17.462 --> 02:06:19.483]  A new Pentagon strategy for securing the U.S.
[02:06:19.523 --> 02:06:21.123]  homeland calls for expanded U.S.
[02:06:21.143 --> 02:06:29.165]  military activity, not in the air and the seas, where the armed forces have historically guarded approaches to the country, but also on the ground.
[02:06:30.462 --> 02:06:39.909]  On the ground, and in other less traditional, potentially more problematic areas, such as intelligence sharing with civilian law enforcement.
[02:06:41.250 --> 02:06:44.213]  The strategy, well, why do the cops then call us civilians?
[02:06:44.233 --> 02:06:47.675]  Because, see, they've already been indoctrinated in the last 20 years into this.
[02:06:47.695 --> 02:06:49.897]  I mean, in Road to Tyranny, I've got a Marine Corps captain.
[02:06:51.167 --> 02:07:02.654]  He now owns a computer company, his face is blacked out, who finally got mad about four years ago when he was driving down I-35 and saw a checkpoint with Army, regular Army, searching vehicles just randomly.
[02:07:03.935 --> 02:07:20.326]  So he called us up, he showed us all the documents, photos of him, and then he became a police officer, and then he started a computer company, he doesn't do that anymore, very successful, but the point is, is that in 1988 and 89, he was in the Marine Corps, and he got a sign in Virginia
[02:07:21.624 --> 02:07:23.245]  To the FBI and local police.
[02:07:24.145 --> 02:07:27.526]  And they would raid gun dealers' houses, homes, drug dealers, you name it.
[02:07:27.566 --> 02:07:31.087]  I mean, the Marines, folks, would put on vests that said, Police.
[02:07:31.747 --> 02:07:33.308]  And I mean, active duty, folks.
[02:07:33.388 --> 02:07:35.789]  I don't mean a Marine Corps Reserve.
[02:07:36.009 --> 02:07:36.889]  He later became a cop.
[02:07:37.569 --> 02:07:40.210]  And I mean, he would raid, kick down doors, you know, team leader.
[02:07:40.630 --> 02:07:41.150]  Boom!
[02:07:41.570 --> 02:07:42.291]  Totally!
[02:07:42.931 --> 02:07:44.111]  A huge felony.
[02:07:45.132 --> 02:07:46.212]  Of course, they didn't even tell him that.
[02:07:46.892 --> 02:07:49.413]  Part of a secret project to defend America from guns.
[02:07:50.652 --> 02:07:53.254]  It was President George Herbert Walker Bush.
[02:07:54.916 --> 02:07:58.258]  And then, all throughout the 90's, you know, I just started learning this stuff.
[02:07:58.278 --> 02:08:04.163]  You know, I was Mr. Conservative Anti-Federal Reserve in the early 1990's, and I got on the air in 1995.
[02:08:06.905 --> 02:08:09.948]  But, uh, you know, I didn't, I kept hearing, yeah, black helicopters.
[02:08:10.008 --> 02:08:12.790]  I was getting calls about it, and I'd say, oh, that's just what kooks talk about.
[02:08:14.289 --> 02:08:16.853]  Then people would fax me, you know, old St.
[02:08:16.893 --> 02:08:17.915]  Louis news articles.
[02:08:17.955 --> 02:08:19.497]  They'd send me articles out of California.
[02:08:19.778 --> 02:08:23.504]  Then a helicopter crashed in downtown Houston and killed a bunch of people.
[02:08:23.945 --> 02:08:28.412]  And it was a Delta Force drill, and that was in Soldier of Fortune, and they criticized it.
[02:08:30.433 --> 02:08:45.665]  And then they hit Texas and I interviewed a police chief and they tried to bribe a San Antonio and then other police chiefs who had foreign troops in drills and blowing up buildings three hundred feet from Casa Ricarda Nursing Home in Kingsville, Texas.
[02:08:45.705 --> 02:08:49.568]  And I went there and videoed the smoking building hours after they'd hit.
[02:08:51.029 --> 02:08:59.255]  And I learned about all the different programs and how they were training the police SWAT team secretly with the military and I began to learn about it and I
[02:09:00.583 --> 02:09:02.704]  I was in the paper, the front page of the paper, you know.
[02:09:03.145 --> 02:09:04.666]  Army invades South Texas.
[02:09:05.826 --> 02:09:07.548]  Delta Force terrorizes public.
[02:09:07.848 --> 02:09:10.530]  Don't mention the foreign troops, which were there, Czech Republic troops.
[02:09:11.530 --> 02:09:16.233]  And, uh, then they had me, Mr. Conspiracy Theorist, preaching the conspiracy gospel.
[02:09:16.693 --> 02:09:19.796]  I'm next to it, still a conspiracy theorist, because I don't like it.
[02:09:19.996 --> 02:09:25.019]  He's a conspiracy theorist, he interviews police chiefs, he... Well, what, I go stick a camera in their face and they admit it?
[02:09:27.318 --> 02:09:29.500]  So, you know, I've been warning and warning.
[02:09:29.520 --> 02:09:33.623]  I mean, this is what I harped on in the 1990s, and now it's old hat.
[02:09:34.764 --> 02:09:39.108]  They have Marine Corps and Army drills and Army National Guard drills.
[02:09:39.188 --> 02:09:45.272]  And then, I don't know, four or five years ago, I'm at my grandmother's house.
[02:09:45.312 --> 02:09:48.475]  She's dead now, bless her heart, but I'm visiting with some cousins that live nearby.
[02:09:49.904 --> 02:09:56.246]  And one of them, you know, been in the Army and in the Special Forces, for now it's like 20 years, but he'd been in like, you know, 16 years or something.
[02:09:56.286 --> 02:10:05.310]  He'd always been overseas, or at Fort Bragg, and he's like, ah, whatever, ah, we're not gonna have microchips, ah, we're not that bad, we gotta train, blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:14.733]  And then, um, I get a call about two and a half years ago, hey, I wanna, I'm stationed in Austin now, I wanna come by your house.
[02:10:15.454 --> 02:10:15.994]  He comes by,
[02:10:17.995 --> 02:10:18.495]  Hey!
[02:10:18.756 --> 02:10:19.636]  How you doing, bro?
[02:10:19.676 --> 02:10:20.437]  Oh, pretty good.
[02:10:20.517 --> 02:10:21.418]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:21.458 --> 02:10:22.218]  Have some coffee?
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:26.102]  Oh, you know, your wife's a nice person.
[02:10:26.122 --> 02:10:26.622]  Blah, blah, blah.
[02:10:26.642 --> 02:10:32.427]  Let me just tell you, they told us all at a secret meeting over a hundred officers in the room that we're all getting microchips in the next two years.
[02:10:32.467 --> 02:10:34.148]  By the way, they're now getting the microchips.
[02:10:35.209 --> 02:10:37.070]  Only officers right now, special forces.
[02:10:37.911 --> 02:10:40.773]  And he goes, yeah, a lot of stuff you said is true and it's really scary.
[02:10:40.793 --> 02:10:45.737]  And he said, but I, you know, I'll probably be getting shipped out, you know, in the next few years.
[02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:47.559]  I'm just setting things up in Austin.
[02:10:49.006 --> 02:10:50.046]  He goes out at Berkstrom.
[02:10:50.066 --> 02:10:52.327]  He goes, I can't tell you too much about it, but some of it's public.
[02:10:54.127 --> 02:10:56.908]  And to make a long story short, we already knew what was going on at Berkstrom.
[02:10:56.928 --> 02:11:01.169]  I was just surprised to learn I had family intimately involved at high levels of it, of course.
[02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:03.789]  You know, the world is so small.
[02:11:03.809 --> 02:11:07.130]  It's just crazy.
[02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:12.131]  And they're merging the National Guard, the Regular Army, and a unit of the APD.
[02:11:13.467 --> 02:11:18.948]  And they have them out there, and they fly around in army helicopters at night, looking through walls, surveilling people, aiding the police.
[02:11:21.049 --> 02:11:22.809]  And all of this is just drilling.
[02:11:22.929 --> 02:11:30.451]  And then every week, sometimes every day, a fax comes in, an email, a mainstream news article, from little towns and big cities.
[02:11:31.131 --> 02:11:34.652]  Oh, the army is giving half of the armory
[02:11:36.389 --> 02:11:41.073]  And it's old military base, but it will be in the same building with the Sheriff's Department.
[02:11:41.553 --> 02:11:43.635]  And with the Police Department moving in too.
[02:11:44.215 --> 02:11:47.378]  As if it isn't bad enough to have the Sheriff and the Police moving in together.
[02:11:48.178 --> 02:11:50.520]  We have jurisdictions for a reason, to stop tyranny.
[02:11:50.800 --> 02:11:52.882]  The Founding Fathers, three branches of government.
[02:11:53.442 --> 02:11:55.864]  Divisions in different parties.
[02:11:55.884 --> 02:11:58.306]  50 different states, 13 at the time.
[02:11:58.566 --> 02:12:01.128]  This is all so one dictator can't have total control.
[02:12:01.168 --> 02:12:02.289]  The Founding Fathers said this.
[02:12:03.244 --> 02:12:08.906]  You've got different jurisdictions, so if you've got a bad cop in charge of a place, a bad sheriff, you know, you can move to the next town.
[02:12:11.067 --> 02:12:12.647]  Okay, it's clear.
[02:12:12.687 --> 02:12:13.828]  I'm going to your calls later.
[02:12:13.848 --> 02:12:14.788]  I've got to talk about this now.
[02:12:14.828 --> 02:12:18.129]  I've gotten off into it, and I'm just going to talk about it, because it's such a big deal.
[02:12:18.249 --> 02:12:20.850]  I've become desensitized where I don't even talk about this anymore.
[02:12:22.551 --> 02:12:28.313]  And, you know, and this has really always been my expertise, my specialty, as they say.
[02:12:30.143 --> 02:12:33.266]  But this is the first thing that really shocked me and saw, man, they're getting ready for martial law.
[02:12:33.286 --> 02:12:39.010]  I mean, I would have emergency managers, you know, who are Vietnam vets, big in major cities, you know, on the show.
[02:12:39.030 --> 02:12:42.153]  Like Mr. Sanchez going, yes, I was in part of the secret meeting.
[02:12:42.173 --> 02:12:42.934]  They said it's PDD 25.
[02:12:43.674 --> 02:12:44.735]  It's training to take our guns.
[02:12:44.815 --> 02:12:46.637]  I was in the meeting with the Delta Force.
[02:12:48.538 --> 02:12:49.159]  That's Kingsville.
[02:12:49.999 --> 02:12:53.422]  I mean, you know, I'm not supposed to go on there and go, well, this is for domestic.
[02:12:54.063 --> 02:12:55.204]  And then I get on a plane.
[02:12:56.264 --> 02:12:56.825]  And I, um,
[02:12:57.688 --> 02:13:07.002]  Fly to Oakland in 99 and there are thousands of Marines and Germans and Dutch and Israelis and French and British and Scots and Australians and...
[02:13:08.647 --> 02:13:20.835]  They got thousands of role-players, and there's the Coronado trip-ship parked right there, and here are the hovercraft and the helicopters, and they got the role-players and let me videotape it.
[02:13:20.855 --> 02:13:22.636]  The role-player is going, I'm an American.
[02:13:23.136 --> 02:13:23.997]  Where'd you get the gun?
[02:13:24.037 --> 02:13:24.517]  Where do you live?
[02:13:24.577 --> 02:13:25.518]  I live in San Francisco.
[02:13:25.578 --> 02:13:26.518]  Why are you resisting?
[02:13:26.858 --> 02:13:28.259]  And I'm sitting there videotaping it.
[02:13:30.381 --> 02:13:30.621]  And then,
[02:13:32.256 --> 02:13:35.839]  Their public relations guy, Jones, runs up and gets in my face and goes, Outta here!
[02:13:35.919 --> 02:13:36.320]  Outta here!
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:36.900]  Outta here!
[02:13:37.361 --> 02:13:39.223]  But I didn't get that much on tape.
[02:13:40.604 --> 02:13:45.929]  And then we had our people stage and go in as part of the tours for local dignitaries and get even worse stuff.
[02:13:45.949 --> 02:13:47.931]  They're staging executions of citizens.
[02:13:49.326 --> 02:13:51.628]  They got the Marines practicing blowing our heads off!
[02:13:51.729 --> 02:13:59.995]  I mean, and then I get, and these guys show up at the TV studio and go, look at this video, we're contractors down at the base in San Antonio, and they have Marines into the base, even though it's not a Marine base.
[02:14:00.216 --> 02:14:02.478]  We can't let you have this, Alex, because they'll know just who we are.
[02:14:02.918 --> 02:14:05.360]  We shot this from the rooftop the second day, we couldn't believe it.
[02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:10.384]  And it's Marines lined up, and there's about 300 role players with signs going, USA!
[02:14:10.704 --> 02:14:11.285]  USA!
[02:14:11.325 --> 02:14:12.406]  Don't take our farms!
[02:14:12.766 --> 02:14:15.689]  And then somebody in the crowd shoots, and then the Marines go,
[02:14:17.865 --> 02:14:20.987]  I mean, give me a break, folks!
[02:14:21.027 --> 02:14:23.188]  They're gearing up to kill farmers!
[02:14:27.030 --> 02:14:28.291]  I mean, this is going on.
[02:14:28.311 --> 02:14:29.732]  And then I got Ridge on video tape.
[02:14:29.752 --> 02:14:34.134]  We played the clip here before, where he goes, gentlemen, you need to get rid of posse commentatus and have troops on the streets.
[02:14:34.415 --> 02:14:36.696]  Secretary of Defense Cohen in 98 said it.
[02:14:37.076 --> 02:14:40.178]  There'll be a day when armored vehicles are on every street corner, but not on the border.
[02:14:42.502 --> 02:14:47.824]  And now everywhere, every town, every county, they just pour in, I mean, every week!
[02:14:48.884 --> 02:14:51.825]  And it says they're merging the police and the military.
[02:14:52.265 --> 02:15:02.129]  And then I get the photos off the local military's own websites, where here we are at the Bay Fest, the city of Alabama, searching everyone that came into the city.
[02:15:02.549 --> 02:15:06.610]  And they're at the major roads, searching families, old ladies, five-year-old children.
[02:15:06.790 --> 02:15:11.652]  I got photos of it from their own websites and on my, in the new Marshall Law film!
[02:15:12.643 --> 02:15:18.787]  Troops out at protest in New York, D.C., Denver with cameras videotaping families?
[02:15:19.047 --> 02:15:22.530]  I mean regular army folks out in the open with cameras!
[02:15:23.010 --> 02:15:24.291]  You talk about East Germany!
[02:15:26.215 --> 02:15:45.453]  And everywhere, a billion to here, 598 million there, Houston, Chicago, LA, Austin, microphones, cameras, in our neighborhoods, everywhere, face scanners, radio transponder readers, the bills introduced to put the transponders and all the inspection stickers and start taxing you, what happened?
[02:15:45.473 --> 02:15:46.794]  2006, but we beat the bill!
[02:15:48.115 --> 02:15:49.757]  I mean, it's just out of control!
[02:15:52.364 --> 02:15:55.226]  Can you read these articles out of the Washington Post and the New York Times?
[02:15:55.246 --> 02:15:57.288]  They go, but don't worry, it doesn't violate posse comitatus.
[02:15:57.308 --> 02:16:03.492]  We're going to have troops running checkpoints and on the street and in your local law enforcement offices with a local CIA coordinator.
[02:16:03.772 --> 02:16:04.693]  Everything's fine.
[02:16:04.733 --> 02:16:16.161]  We're handing out tattletale spy booklets and we're training everyone to look for marijuana and look for guns and... I mean, they're setting up the Stasi right here in front of us!
[02:16:16.181 --> 02:16:18.563]  I mean, look at this out of the New York Times.
[02:16:19.662 --> 02:16:21.303]  This is the New York Times yesterday.
[02:16:21.363 --> 02:16:22.284]  I never got to this yesterday.
[02:16:22.304 --> 02:16:22.965]  I'll cover it now.
[02:16:24.346 --> 02:16:25.167]  Take a breath, Alex.
[02:16:26.348 --> 02:16:29.550]  The Pentagon directs attention to domestic warfare.
[02:16:29.610 --> 02:16:35.135]  The Pentagon's most senior planners are changing the long-standing strategy that requires... It was never a long-standing strategy.
[02:16:35.155 --> 02:16:36.075]  This has always been the strategy.
[02:16:36.556 --> 02:16:38.978]  The armed forces prepare to fight two major wars at a time.
[02:16:40.569 --> 02:16:45.272]  Instead, they are moving resources to defending America territory in anti-terrorism efforts.
[02:16:45.752 --> 02:16:51.476]  The consideration of these profound changes are at the center of the current top-down review of Pentagon strategy.
[02:16:51.836 --> 02:16:59.702]  It's ordered by Congress every four years and will determine the future size of the military as well as the fate of hundreds of billions of dollars in new weapons.
[02:17:00.082 --> 02:17:05.045]  The intense debate reflects the growing recognition of the current burden of maintaining forces in Iraq.
[02:17:05.065 --> 02:17:07.767]  So, mixed in with gobbledygook, they tell the truth.
[02:17:08.599 --> 02:17:18.801]  And it goes on, an official designation of the counter-terrorism role is a shift of strategy that focuses on domestic defenses, will have a huge impact on the size and composition of the military.
[02:17:19.841 --> 02:17:21.201]  And it gets into troops on the ground.
[02:17:21.221 --> 02:17:22.382]  This is right here at Washington Post.
[02:17:22.722 --> 02:17:26.963]  Troops on the ground in major cities, defending key infrastructure points.
[02:17:29.143 --> 02:17:34.544]  Folks, I got video of them in 98 running checkpoints on I-35 pulling people out of cars.
[02:17:35.569 --> 02:17:41.283]  They've been beta testing and creating the Cadres for decades and now it's here folks!
[02:17:42.346 --> 02:17:43.408]  Heaven help us!
[02:17:45.629 --> 02:17:51.852]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:17:52.312 --> 02:18:00.095]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:18:00.436 --> 02:18:08.279]  Is this a flaw of free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:18:08.599 --> 02:18:13.361]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:18:13.681 --> 02:18:18.403]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[02:18:18.903 --> 02:18:22.765]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[02:18:23.265 --> 02:18:24.265]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.

[02:19:40.723 --> 02:19:47.609]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.310 --> 02:19:53.495]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[02:19:54.386 --> 02:20:01.270]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[02:20:02.330 --> 02:20:10.934]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?

[02:22:10.573 --> 02:22:12.233]  It has nothing to do with terrorists.
[02:22:12.373 --> 02:22:13.174]  It never did.
[02:22:13.194 --> 02:22:21.158]  And in Road to Tyranny, I have troops walking up to us in Central Texas in downtown Belton going, hey, you're not allowed to tape me, what are you doing?
[02:22:21.198 --> 02:22:23.259]  And an officer goes, well, actually they are.
[02:22:25.942 --> 02:22:29.823]  You're the guy that typed us at that checkpoint and put me on the internet!
[02:22:29.883 --> 02:22:31.604]  I'm like, yeah, I am the man.
[02:22:33.264 --> 02:22:34.505]  You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
[02:22:35.725 --> 02:22:37.426]  That was long before 9-11, folks.
[02:22:37.826 --> 02:22:40.326]  I mean, this is the type of stuff that's in my videos.
[02:22:40.366 --> 02:22:41.487]  Let's go to Vince.
[02:22:42.727 --> 02:22:44.828]  Vince, where are you calling us from?
[02:22:45.328 --> 02:22:45.428]  St.
[02:22:45.448 --> 02:22:46.188]  Paul, Minnesota.
[02:22:46.308 --> 02:22:46.388]  St.
[02:22:46.408 --> 02:22:47.489]  Paul, Minnesota there, Alex.
[02:22:47.549 --> 02:22:48.149]  Welcome, Vince.
[02:22:48.589 --> 02:22:49.029]  Thank you.
[02:22:49.049 --> 02:22:51.290]  You know what is amazing?
[02:22:51.310 --> 02:22:54.911]  It truly is amazing that our folk called Christian churches
[02:22:55.760 --> 02:23:02.006]  I think so much, so highly of our government, of what's going on in the Middle East.
[02:23:02.226 --> 02:23:03.587]  Gonzales is of the Lord!
[02:23:03.647 --> 02:23:07.631]  Pro-abortion, anti-gun, member of MACHA, pro-torture, that's of the Lord!
[02:23:07.791 --> 02:23:09.332]  It's just totally amazing.
[02:23:09.533 --> 02:23:22.144]  And nowadays I go to my regular church, 501 Church or whatever that is, I find every other week it's starting to get very entertaining because
[02:23:23.024 --> 02:23:27.166]  It's something new that has come up that appalled me.
[02:23:27.206 --> 02:23:34.028]  I think it was last month that a pastor of a Bible group was saying, protests are bad.
[02:23:34.088 --> 02:23:37.109]  The government knows what it's doing and protests are usually done out of disorder.
[02:23:37.189 --> 02:23:37.449]  Demons!
[02:23:37.469 --> 02:23:39.930]  Demons do what they're demons!
[02:23:40.090 --> 02:23:41.051]  We must burn them!
[02:23:50.399 --> 02:23:57.343]  I'd only said what I could at the time because these subjects are so off the wall that I think, well, how can I respond to that?
[02:23:57.363 --> 02:23:57.943]  That's why I raised my hand.
[02:23:57.963 --> 02:24:01.705]  Well, that's because the World Council of Churches, look, they're about to get the faith-based initiative.
[02:24:01.845 --> 02:24:05.027]  Billions, what is it, like 10 billion a year for the churches starting.
[02:24:05.367 --> 02:24:12.251]  So they've been told by their denomination heads, you're going to get a bigger church and be promoted if you get it on the ground floor of being a government preacher.
[02:24:12.771 --> 02:24:14.852]  I tend to believe that very much, though.
[02:24:14.872 --> 02:24:16.013]  Oh, that's the plans all.
[02:24:16.093 --> 02:24:16.493]  It's freedom.
[02:24:16.753 --> 02:24:19.315]  Everybody knows that when the government runs the churches, it's freedom.
[02:24:19.955 --> 02:24:22.797]  It must be.
[02:24:23.537 --> 02:24:24.858]  You're not with Al-Qaeda, are you?
[02:24:26.719 --> 02:24:26.979]  Me?
[02:24:27.219 --> 02:24:27.879]  Listen, listen.
[02:24:27.999 --> 02:24:29.320]  You will worship Alberto.
[02:24:29.380 --> 02:24:30.821]  Abortion is of the Lord.
[02:24:31.681 --> 02:24:34.303]  Now, I happen to think it's evil, but no, no.
[02:24:34.723 --> 02:24:37.624]  And soon we'll have our world leader and the churches will worship him.
[02:24:37.905 --> 02:24:39.485]  They will say, the Lord has come.
[02:24:39.505 --> 02:24:39.565]  Yes.
[02:24:40.466 --> 02:24:44.348]  They will worship him at his throne.
[02:24:45.180 --> 02:24:45.921]  Neither.
[02:24:45.941 --> 02:24:49.485]  No, I mean literally, folks.
[02:24:49.505 --> 02:24:50.186]  I mean, they're ready.
[02:24:51.767 --> 02:25:01.018]  You know, when I responded, I said, well, how about the protest in the square of China ten years ago, where Chinese people were protesting for freedom?
[02:25:01.538 --> 02:25:03.941]  And he said in his past response, well, that was
[02:25:04.389 --> 02:25:05.310]  Righteous protest.
[02:25:05.410 --> 02:25:07.311]  I said, well, I mean... Aha!
[02:25:07.391 --> 02:25:09.633]  It's what they decide when it's righteous.
[02:25:09.653 --> 02:25:13.536]  Yeah, you know, it's just totally appalling, totally amazing.
[02:25:13.596 --> 02:25:24.023]  And I've paused for every week that I show up, but I still show up just to, you know, shed some light on what's going on in the world.
[02:25:24.043 --> 02:25:26.985]  Because the Christian church and the Christians are
[02:25:28.866 --> 02:25:32.608]  Well, let me tell you, the government... Thanks for the call, Vince.
[02:25:33.088 --> 02:25:33.368]  Go ahead.
[02:25:33.989 --> 02:25:34.369]  One more thing.
[02:25:34.669 --> 02:25:37.090]  I have an audio tape I want to send you, Alex.
[02:25:37.130 --> 02:25:40.372]  I got this off of ABC News Perspective, and I'd like to send it to you.
[02:25:40.392 --> 02:25:41.252]  If I can get the address?
[02:25:41.713 --> 02:25:41.953]  Sure.
[02:25:42.013 --> 02:25:46.455]  It's 3001-3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:25:46.495 --> 02:25:46.455]  78704.
[02:25:46.755 --> 02:25:47.115]  Suite 100.
[02:25:58.874 --> 02:25:59.214]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:00.595 --> 02:26:01.295]  Thank you.
[02:26:01.515 --> 02:26:02.855]  Thank you, Vince.
[02:26:02.875 --> 02:26:03.375]  Great job.
[02:26:03.575 --> 02:26:04.235]  Thank you.
[02:26:04.595 --> 02:26:05.416]  William in Oregon.
[02:26:05.456 --> 02:26:06.156]  William, go ahead.
[02:26:07.456 --> 02:26:09.516]  Alex, a couple quick things.
[02:26:09.536 --> 02:26:15.338]  I was doing some homework the other day, and I don't know if you're aware of it or not, but the big deal, of course, 9-11 was 9-11.
[02:26:15.578 --> 02:26:24.460]  And I realized that in Germany, in 1989, when the wall came down, perhaps it was November 9th, which is 11-9, inverted.
[02:26:24.540 --> 02:26:26.640]  I thought that was kind of a little interesting footnote to life.
[02:26:27.866 --> 02:26:32.727]  Also, I did a search on FEMA, just for curiosity's sake, on 9-11 photos.
[02:26:33.667 --> 02:26:38.728]  None available except for a lot of memorial type stuff, but I couldn't find anything having to do with that.
[02:26:38.768 --> 02:26:42.069]  Can't let you see those photos, you might see something!
[02:26:42.469 --> 02:26:44.969]  I know, I find that a pretty crazy coincidence.
[02:26:45.030 --> 02:26:52.451]  And I was also talking to a friend of mine that's involved with Cliff Carnicom and his DVD distribution, and evidently he's
[02:26:52.904 --> 02:27:00.987]  One of his advocates has been sending samples in somewhere in Missouri to a testing plant and after like eight samples they won't do it anymore and test the ground.
[02:27:01.027 --> 02:27:09.330]  Evidently there's lots of salt compounds being found as well as in northern New Mexico and what they're finding is it's wiping out tons of trees as a result of all the spraying.
[02:27:09.370 --> 02:27:13.092]  Well the government's praying as much as the government's loving is what they're doing.
[02:27:13.912 --> 02:27:14.472]  I know it's crazy.
[02:27:14.512 --> 02:27:15.773]  Now a really serious thing here.
[02:27:16.792 --> 02:27:21.494]  I've talked to you before about putting this DVDs and videos on our local cable station.
[02:27:21.594 --> 02:27:25.296]  I need to talk to somebody offline because they say they can't do it until they get a release.
[02:27:25.316 --> 02:27:25.716]  I told them to.
[02:27:25.776 --> 02:27:27.476]  Sir, just write up a release and sign my name!
[02:27:28.437 --> 02:27:28.957]  La-da-la!
[02:27:29.417 --> 02:27:29.757]  What do I do?
[02:27:29.797 --> 02:27:30.138]  La-da-la!
[02:27:30.558 --> 02:27:31.138]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:31.158 --> 02:27:31.778]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:31.818 --> 02:27:32.379]  Keep it up, man.
[02:27:32.399 --> 02:27:33.099]  You're doing a good job.
[02:27:36.200 --> 02:27:37.100]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.581 --> 02:27:39.201]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.102 --> 02:27:42.803]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.672 --> 02:27:49.054]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:27:49.294 --> 02:27:49.634]  Why?
[02:27:49.654 --> 02:27:52.595]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[02:28:45.518 --> 02:28:51.762]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.903 --> 02:28:58.067]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.347 --> 02:29:06.793]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.033 --> 02:29:14.058]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.338 --> 02:29:19.182]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.382 --> 02:29:24.806]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.146 --> 02:29:28.229]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.549 --> 02:29:36.535]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:36.555 --> 02:29:37.136]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.988 --> 02:29:52.893]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:29:53.414 --> 02:29:58.818]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[02:29:59.238 --> 02:30:09.265]  All Natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:30:09.406 --> 02:30:11.807]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:30:12.128 --> 02:30:15.150]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:30:15.630 --> 02:30:16.791]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:30:16.931 --> 02:30:19.813]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[02:30:20.094 --> 02:30:24.417]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:30:24.677 --> 02:30:26.399]  It's also money-back guaranteed.

[02:30:39.008 --> 02:30:43.352]  Non-X Nail Gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:30:58.107 --> 02:30:59.508]  You know, I've said this for years.
[02:30:59.588 --> 02:31:00.668]  I'll never get around to doing it.
[02:31:00.688 --> 02:31:01.329]  I'm so busy.
[02:31:01.389 --> 02:31:15.159]  I need to put a open form letter on the website saying you are authorized to air my documentary films in their entirety or in part via access television anywhere in the country.
[02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:18.241]  Or to, you know, do similar things.
[02:31:18.281 --> 02:31:20.263]  As long as for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:31:21.033 --> 02:31:29.237]  And I mean, all the time, I'm signing these things, I've got to talk to the people, get the name, write the letter, sign it, send it out, at the end of the takeover.
[02:31:30.738 --> 02:31:33.319]  Police state to the takeover.
[02:31:33.419 --> 02:31:41.884]  I spend like two minutes, or three or four minutes on activism, and I say, you're authorized to make copies of this film, you're authorized to air them on AXS TV.
[02:31:43.601 --> 02:31:46.342]  Just write up a form and, you know, give it to them.
[02:31:46.362 --> 02:31:50.664]  And if they call saying, is Billy Bob Johnson allowed to air this stuff on our... Yes!
[02:31:51.685 --> 02:31:56.627]  Billy Bob Johnson or William, whatever his name is, you're allowed to, William.
[02:31:57.067 --> 02:31:59.248]  Alright, let's take a few more calls and I'm going back to the news.
[02:31:59.749 --> 02:32:00.929]  Bill in Canada.
[02:32:00.949 --> 02:32:02.510]  Let's go north to Canada.
[02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:03.090]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:32:03.470 --> 02:32:04.331]  Yes, Alec.
[02:32:04.371 --> 02:32:05.391]  How are you doing, brother?
[02:32:05.651 --> 02:32:05.911]  Good.
[02:32:06.332 --> 02:32:07.212]  I call you brother.
[02:32:07.232 --> 02:32:08.393]  I have high respect for you.
[02:32:08.433 --> 02:32:11.114]  I don't worship you, but let me tell you about Canada here.
[02:32:11.690 --> 02:32:15.893]  You know how many churches were in full support of homosexuals' parade?
[02:32:16.793 --> 02:32:18.594]  I found out through the... I think all of them.
[02:32:18.614 --> 02:32:19.995]  Don't you get arrested if you don't?
[02:32:20.575 --> 02:32:39.447]  You see, the lady that worked in a church, United Church, she told me that they have secret meetings, the preachers, the Catholics, the so-called Catholic Homosexual Organization, United Churches, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Pentecost, they're all getting together and all the preachers say we have to show love to them.
[02:32:40.297 --> 02:32:41.558]  We have to be nice to them.
[02:32:41.818 --> 02:32:47.860]  You know there are more women taking the side of homosexuals, and more women are in full support.
[02:32:48.861 --> 02:32:50.141]  Hey, I'm a pastor, brother.
[02:32:50.502 --> 02:32:53.123]  But I will not preach in any churches anymore.
[02:32:54.063 --> 02:32:58.765]  Don't get me wrong, I was trained by the Jesuits in Curitiba Parana in Brazil.
[02:33:01.006 --> 02:33:03.307]  I spent 12 years in Jesuits seminary.
[02:33:03.627 --> 02:33:06.008]  But I tell you one thing, the corruption is global.
[02:33:06.329 --> 02:33:08.069]  You're talking about martial law, brother.
[02:33:08.189 --> 02:33:09.510]  I highly respect what you say.
[02:33:10.154 --> 02:33:11.775]  He's going to be global very soon.
[02:33:13.216 --> 02:33:21.480]  Well, police dressed in the exact same Darth Vader outfits our police are attacking peaceful protesters at the G8 right now, not letting them protest.
[02:33:22.020 --> 02:33:27.843]  You know, Alec, when I lived in Brazil when I was a young boy, they have a death squad.
[02:33:27.883 --> 02:33:29.984]  Maybe you've heard about the Brazilian death squad, right?
[02:33:30.864 --> 02:33:31.104]  Sure.
[02:33:31.344 --> 02:33:32.525]  They're all dressed in black.
[02:33:33.405 --> 02:33:37.908]  Now, when you see the SWAT team here, it's similar training.
[02:33:38.008 --> 02:33:39.208]  It's paramilitary training.
[02:33:39.248 --> 02:33:42.330]  Look, death squads have always worn black and black masks.
[02:33:42.390 --> 02:33:52.196]  Going back... The SWAT team, globally, it's nothing but a death squad training for the future to eliminate opposition of the new world order.
[02:33:53.176 --> 02:33:53.937]  It's nothing new.
[02:33:54.217 --> 02:33:56.318]  Well, when they really try that, I feel sorry for them.
[02:33:56.937 --> 02:33:58.761]  I spent nine years with the Green Berets.
[02:33:59.302 --> 02:34:02.468]  And I tell you, I read all kind of manuals about concentration camps.
[02:34:02.748 --> 02:34:04.591]  I even phoned Bo Gritz.
[02:34:05.493 --> 02:34:06.836]  You know what Bo Gritz told me?
[02:34:07.377 --> 02:34:07.998]  That's secret.
[02:34:08.038 --> 02:34:09.481]  You should not expose that.
[02:34:10.123 --> 02:34:12.825]  Years ago, maybe 15 years ago, I phoned Bogric.
[02:34:12.865 --> 02:34:14.006]  Maybe you heard about Bogric?
[02:34:14.446 --> 02:34:16.128]  Yeah, I know who Belzebo is.
[02:34:16.588 --> 02:34:19.570]  Yes, and I told him, why are you such a patriot?
[02:34:19.991 --> 02:34:25.055]  Don't, can't you realize that when you're drafted, you're drafted into slavery, not into the army.
[02:34:25.095 --> 02:34:27.897]  You're drafted into serving a global system.
[02:34:28.597 --> 02:34:29.958]  Nothing to do with America.
[02:34:30.259 --> 02:34:32.400]  America in Canada is not a free country.
[02:34:32.440 --> 02:34:34.482]  It's run by the invisible government.
[02:34:34.502 --> 02:34:36.043]  The men didn't want to listen to that.
[02:34:37.224 --> 02:34:39.706]  That's right, but we have something global now.
[02:34:40.222 --> 02:34:42.483]  It's total global disaster.
[02:34:43.283 --> 02:34:44.843]  It's globalization.
[02:34:46.264 --> 02:34:48.384]  What's that one manual for Gladio?
[02:34:48.524 --> 02:34:49.504]  FM Field Manual.
[02:34:49.564 --> 02:34:50.345]  Is it 22?
[02:34:51.105 --> 02:34:51.845]  I'm going from memory.
[02:34:51.965 --> 02:34:54.866]  That's a government sponsored terror manual.
[02:34:56.586 --> 02:35:06.109]  Brother, when they have a crisis management, the master plan is when you study the protocol, the elders of Zion, you study everything inside out.
[02:35:06.349 --> 02:35:07.769]  The protocols are not Jewish.
[02:35:08.374 --> 02:35:08.874]  I studied.
[02:35:08.994 --> 02:35:13.937]  I have been enrolled in the 16th century by the Jesuits in England.
[02:35:14.157 --> 02:35:15.878]  I remember you called before.
[02:35:15.918 --> 02:35:17.518]  Your dad was what, an SS Colonel?
[02:35:18.219 --> 02:35:19.960]  He was a Colonel in the German Army.
[02:35:20.220 --> 02:35:20.980]  Oh, the German Army.
[02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:21.460]  Weimar.
[02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:24.522]  And so you went to Brazil.
[02:35:24.822 --> 02:35:25.102]  Yes.
[02:35:25.382 --> 02:35:27.303]  In 1946 I was only a young boy.
[02:35:28.264 --> 02:35:32.426]  And I grew up and I was in a Jesuit seminary in Curitiba, Paraná.
[02:35:33.266 --> 02:35:34.647]  And I graduated as a priest.
[02:35:35.187 --> 02:35:37.408]  Then I went to the Army, United States Military.
[02:35:38.638 --> 02:35:39.639]  And I've seen everything.
[02:35:39.839 --> 02:35:47.803]  And I've seen both sides, how the Jesuits... You see, when you're talking about torture, the American military, where did the torture come from?
[02:35:47.823 --> 02:35:54.407]  When you study Inquisitions, the French, the Dominicans, the Jesuits, they performed the art of torture.
[02:35:54.967 --> 02:35:58.530]  And now, secretly, they're doing what we have now.
[02:35:58.790 --> 02:36:00.791]  It's nothing but invisible Inquisition.
[02:36:00.831 --> 02:36:02.892]  The reputation of Inquisition.
[02:36:04.033 --> 02:36:04.773]  It's nothing new.
[02:36:05.834 --> 02:36:06.294]  That's right.
[02:36:07.555 --> 02:36:07.775]  Alex,
[02:36:08.428 --> 02:36:10.309]  Everything is coming to it's time.
[02:36:11.049 --> 02:36:13.330]  We have invisible inquisition.
[02:36:13.930 --> 02:36:18.231]  But the torture, the art of torture, it's nothing new, it has been in process.
[02:36:18.731 --> 02:36:25.934]  You see Mossad, you see Rabbis, they are enforcing, because in Israel they are, they torture the Palestinians.
[02:36:26.494 --> 02:36:29.355]  By the way, torture is legal in Israel.
[02:36:29.855 --> 02:36:30.415]  I know that!
[02:36:31.198 --> 02:36:34.079]  And when I was talking to rabbis, you know what they told me?
[02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:43.884]  And do you know that Jewish people have over 1,200 concentration camps to torture Germans and mass slaughter Germans?
[02:36:44.604 --> 02:36:53.348]  And my father told me when we were young boys, me and my brother, my sister, my father said there were never 6 million Jewish killed.
[02:36:53.928 --> 02:36:59.931]  Possibly maybe 400,000, but not 6 million, because the total population of Jewish people
[02:37:00.527 --> 02:37:02.428]  In Germany, we're around 3 million.
[02:37:02.809 --> 02:37:05.090]  Where did they get the 6 million?
[02:37:05.130 --> 02:37:08.173]  Listen, Bill, I appreciate your call from Canada.
[02:37:08.553 --> 02:37:10.074]  I'm going to cover some news here.
[02:37:10.214 --> 02:37:10.634]  Thank you.
[02:37:11.615 --> 02:37:15.038]  Alright, on the record here, I am not a Scientologist.
[02:37:15.158 --> 02:37:16.879]  I don't know any Scientologists.
[02:37:17.319 --> 02:37:23.904]  I don't support the New Age weirdness of the teachings of... Oh, what's his name?
[02:37:25.045 --> 02:37:25.945]  I'm drawing a blank here.
[02:37:26.065 --> 02:37:26.786]  L. Ron Hubbard.
[02:37:28.607 --> 02:37:35.790]  But what the media has done is they've made it a debate between drugging the population being good or you're with the Scientologist.
[02:37:36.250 --> 02:37:43.212]  And look, I support the Scientologist in saying that drugging's bad and shock therapy's bad and what they're doing on that front is a good thing.
[02:37:43.232 --> 02:37:47.534]  A lot of the other stuff is pretty serious and I don't agree with it.
[02:37:48.794 --> 02:37:50.295]  I have to say that openly here.
[02:37:51.934 --> 02:37:58.796]  People love conspiracy theories, and there's some 50-something year old Scientologist PR guy named Alex Jones.
[02:37:58.816 --> 02:38:08.698]  But I'm not being accused of being him, I'm being accused of being the head of the Shorenstein Center, Alex Jones, a 60-something year old New York Times writer.
[02:38:08.798 --> 02:38:09.798]  No, I'm not that guy.
[02:38:10.418 --> 02:38:17.260]  And I'm not the billionaire up in Canada who owns a bunch of factories named Alex Jones who's 70-something years old.
[02:38:19.217 --> 02:38:23.240]  And, uh, I'm not the local photographer Alex Jones for the Austin American Statesman.
[02:38:24.381 --> 02:38:25.002]  Not him either.
[02:38:25.022 --> 02:38:31.606]  I just... I keep getting emails, and this is something I don't really have time to respond to this, but... It's annoying.
[02:38:31.706 --> 02:38:33.748]  Jones is the most common name in the U.S.
[02:38:34.488 --> 02:38:36.170]  Smith and Jones are, like, tied.
[02:38:36.590 --> 02:38:39.992]  And Alex is one of the most common, so... I have to just say that.
[02:38:40.333 --> 02:38:42.534]  I do support Tom Cruise, though, in what he said.
[02:38:42.554 --> 02:38:46.237]  And, uh, you have to wonder, why is he being demonized?
[02:38:47.759 --> 02:38:52.361]  I had family over this weekend, and they go, Tom Cruise is just horrible.
[02:38:52.421 --> 02:38:53.541]  The news just says he's bad.
[02:38:53.561 --> 02:38:58.743]  I said to the family member, who's a sweetheart, I said, honey, what did he do?
[02:38:58.783 --> 02:38:59.583]  Well, he's rude.
[02:38:59.783 --> 02:39:02.504]  Oh, somebody sprays water in his face, and he goes, you're a jerk.
[02:39:03.105 --> 02:39:03.645]  So he's bad.
[02:39:05.346 --> 02:39:09.787]  Or he argues and sticks up for himself with Matt Lauer, who's just a complete snake.
[02:39:10.447 --> 02:39:13.629]  So here's that little four or five minute clip.
[02:39:13.689 --> 02:39:14.709]  But before we get to that,
[02:39:15.763 --> 02:39:21.564]  FDA issued second suicide warning for adults on SSRIs, serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[02:39:21.724 --> 02:39:24.905]  That's the Associated Press.
[02:39:25.385 --> 02:39:26.785]  This is in the last three days.
[02:39:26.945 --> 02:39:27.365]  This is 7-3-5.
[02:39:27.385 --> 02:39:29.065]  This is three days ago.
[02:39:29.606 --> 02:39:31.946]  Here's one from a couple days ago, Houston Chronicle.
[02:39:32.006 --> 02:39:34.987]  Closer look for possible Ritalin cancer link.
[02:39:39.187 --> 02:39:39.767]  Here's another one.
[02:39:40.107 --> 02:39:42.868]  Ritalin aspartame chromosome damage killing kids.
[02:39:44.208 --> 02:39:45.869]  I mean, this is all in the last three days.
[02:39:47.110 --> 02:39:47.410]  Okay?
[02:39:48.751 --> 02:39:51.112]  So, this is the reality.
[02:39:51.733 --> 02:39:55.095]  But this is why now the media is attacking Tom Cruise on a daily basis.
[02:39:55.375 --> 02:39:58.277]  Because he's shooting his mouth off against them and they don't like it.
[02:39:59.097 --> 02:40:00.758]  Go ahead and roll it.
[02:40:02.940 --> 02:40:04.060]  The Tom Cruise clip, please.
[02:40:05.021 --> 02:40:05.461]  Do we ever.
[02:40:08.843 --> 02:40:11.164]  Before I was a Scientologist, I never agreed with Psychiatry.
[02:40:11.184 --> 02:40:16.468]  And then when I started studying the history of Psychiatry, I started realizing more and more why I didn't agree with Psychiatry.
[02:40:16.668 --> 02:40:22.551]  And as far as the Brooke Shields thing is, look, you gotta understand, I really care about Brooke Shields.
[02:40:24.732 --> 02:40:29.055]  I think here's a wonderful and talented woman.
[02:40:30.956 --> 02:40:33.117]  And I want to see her do well.
[02:40:34.038 --> 02:40:37.940]  And I know that Psychiatry is
[02:40:39.301 --> 02:40:40.421]  It's a pseudoscience.
[02:40:40.501 --> 02:40:50.745]  But Tom, if she said that this particular thing helped her feel better, whether it was the antidepressant or going to a counselor or a psychiatrist, isn't that enough?
[02:40:50.945 --> 02:40:53.966]  Matt, you have to understand this.
[02:40:54.026 --> 02:41:05.269]  Here we are today, where I talk out against drugs and psychiatric abuses of electric shocking people, okay, against their will, of drugging children with them not knowing
[02:41:05.985 --> 02:41:06.889]  The effects of these drugs.
[02:41:06.909 --> 02:41:08.354]  Do you know what Adderall is?
[02:41:08.414 --> 02:41:09.378]  Do you know Ritalin?
[02:41:09.598 --> 02:41:11.585]  Do you know now that Ritalin is a street drug?
[02:41:12.642 --> 02:41:13.363]  Do you understand that?
[02:41:13.843 --> 02:41:16.245]  The difference is, this was not against her will, though.
[02:41:16.305 --> 02:41:18.226]  But this wasn't against Brooke's will.
[02:41:18.266 --> 02:41:19.107]  Matt, I'm asking you a question.
[02:41:19.127 --> 02:41:21.548]  I understand there's abuse of all of these things.
[02:41:21.588 --> 02:41:22.949]  No, you see, here's the problem.
[02:41:23.090 --> 02:41:25.131]  You don't know the history of psychiatry.
[02:41:25.451 --> 02:41:25.792]  I do.
[02:41:26.272 --> 02:41:31.416]  Aren't there examples, and might not Brooke Shields be an example of someone who benefited from one of those drugs?
[02:41:31.616 --> 02:41:33.997]  All it does is mask the problem, Matt.
[02:41:34.238 --> 02:41:36.900]  And if you understand the history of it, it masks the problem.
[02:41:37.660 --> 02:41:38.301]  That's what it does.
[02:41:39.481 --> 02:41:40.082]  That's all it does.
[02:41:41.204 --> 02:41:42.764]  You're not getting to the reason why.
[02:41:43.044 --> 02:41:45.565]  There is no such thing as a chemical imbalance.
[02:41:46.145 --> 02:41:51.366]  So postpartum depression to you is kind of a little psychological gobbly goop?
[02:41:51.706 --> 02:41:51.866]  No.
[02:41:52.126 --> 02:41:53.067]  No, I did not say that.
[02:41:53.087 --> 02:41:55.967]  I'm just asking, what would you call it?
[02:41:56.327 --> 02:41:58.548]  Now you're talking about two different things.
[02:41:58.608 --> 02:42:00.448]  That's what she went on the antidepressant for.
[02:42:00.788 --> 02:42:03.589]  But what happens, the antidepressant, all it does is mask the problem.
[02:42:03.609 --> 02:42:04.729]  There's ways of vitamins.
[02:42:05.069 --> 02:42:06.610]  And through exercise and various things.
[02:42:06.630 --> 02:42:07.771]  I'm not saying that that isn't real.
[02:42:08.131 --> 02:42:08.832]  That's not what I'm saying.
[02:42:08.852 --> 02:42:11.073]  That's an alteration of what I'm saying.
[02:42:11.113 --> 02:42:13.115]  I'm saying that drugs aren't the answer.
[02:42:13.475 --> 02:42:15.536]  That these drugs are very dangerous.
[02:42:15.556 --> 02:42:18.979]  They're mind-altering, anti-psychotic drugs.
[02:42:19.519 --> 02:42:24.062]  And there are ways of doing it without that, so that we don't end up in a brave new world.
[02:42:24.443 --> 02:42:27.525]  The thing that I'm saying about Brooke is that there's misinformation.
[02:42:28.377 --> 02:42:28.717]  Okay.
[02:42:29.118 --> 02:42:31.779]  And she doesn't understand the history of psychiatry.
[02:42:32.580 --> 02:42:35.221]  She doesn't understand in the same way that you don't understand it, man.
[02:42:35.962 --> 02:42:45.167]  But a little bit what you're saying, Tom, is you say you want people to do well, but you want them to do well by taking the road that you approve of, as opposed to a road that may work for them.
[02:42:45.567 --> 02:42:45.767]  No.
[02:42:46.668 --> 02:42:47.068]  No, I'm not.
[02:42:47.969 --> 02:42:52.391]  Well, if anti-depressants work for Book Shields, why isn't that okay?
[02:42:52.731 --> 02:42:53.432]  I disagree with it.
[02:42:54.364 --> 02:42:56.827]  And I think that there's a higher and better quality of life.
[02:42:57.187 --> 02:43:02.012]  And I think that promoting, for me personally, see you're saying, what, I can't discuss what I want to discuss?
[02:43:02.032 --> 02:43:03.133]  No, you absolutely can.
[02:43:03.193 --> 02:43:05.275]  I know, but Matt, you're going in and saying that
[02:43:06.272 --> 02:43:07.192]  That I can't discuss that.
[02:43:07.232 --> 02:43:13.535]  I'm only asking, isn't there a possibility that... Do you examine the possibility that these things do work for some people?
[02:43:13.795 --> 02:43:15.116]  That yes, there are abuses.
[02:43:15.556 --> 02:43:17.837]  And yes, maybe they've gone too far in certain areas.
[02:43:17.877 --> 02:43:19.437]  Maybe there are too many kids on Ritalin.
[02:43:19.738 --> 02:43:21.478]  Maybe electric shock... How many kids on Ritalin?
[02:43:21.979 --> 02:43:22.419]  I'm just saying.
[02:43:22.779 --> 02:43:25.120]  But aren't there examples where it works?
[02:43:25.840 --> 02:43:27.301]  Matt, you don't even... you're glib.
[02:43:27.341 --> 02:43:28.762]  You don't even know what Ritalin is.
[02:43:28.782 --> 02:43:35.745]  If you start talking about chemical imbalance, you have to evaluate and read the research papers on how they came up with these theories, Matt.
[02:43:36.205 --> 02:43:36.485]  Okay?
[02:43:36.825 --> 02:43:37.566]  That's what I've done.
[02:43:38.286 --> 02:43:40.967]  And you go and you say, where's the medical test?
[02:43:41.067 --> 02:43:44.009]  Where's the blood test that says how much Ritalin you're supposed to get?
[02:43:45.425 --> 02:43:49.707]  It's very impressive to listen to you, because clearly you've done the homework and you know the subject.
[02:43:49.787 --> 02:43:50.347]  And you should.
[02:43:50.947 --> 02:43:55.088]  And you should do that also, because just knowing people who are on Ritalin isn't enough.
[02:43:55.228 --> 02:44:01.330]  You should be a little bit more responsible in knowing... I'm not prescribing Ritalin, Tom, and I'm not asking anyone else to do it.
[02:44:01.350 --> 02:44:03.891]  I know some people who seem to have been helpful.
[02:44:04.131 --> 02:44:07.112]  But you're saying... this is a very important issue.
[02:44:07.792 --> 02:44:08.713]  I couldn't agree more.
[02:44:08.753 --> 02:44:10.976]  You know what, and you're here on the Today Show.
[02:44:10.996 --> 02:44:11.256]  Right.
[02:44:11.696 --> 02:44:21.986]  And to talk about it in a way of saying, well, isn't it okay in being reasonable about it when you don't know, and I do, I think that you should be a little bit more responsible in knowing what it is.
[02:44:22.387 --> 02:44:24.308]  Because you communicate to people.
[02:44:24.329 --> 02:44:29.774]  But you're now telling me that your experiences with the people I know, which are zero,
[02:44:30.626 --> 02:44:32.087]  Are more important than my experiences.
[02:44:32.107 --> 02:44:33.107]  What do you mean by that?
[02:44:33.427 --> 02:44:38.930]  You're telling me what's worked for people I know, or hasn't worked for people I know, and I'm telling you, I've lived with these people.
[02:44:39.690 --> 02:44:40.431]  And they're better.
[02:44:41.791 --> 02:44:43.412]  So you're, you're advocating it.
[02:44:43.652 --> 02:44:44.152]  I am not.
[02:44:44.212 --> 02:44:48.775]  I'm telling you, in their case, in their individual case, it worked.
[02:44:49.215 --> 02:44:53.257]  I am not going to go out and say, get your kids on Riddle and it's the cure-all and the end-all.
[02:44:53.277 --> 02:44:54.177]  Matt, but here's the point.
[02:44:54.377 --> 02:44:55.858]  What is an ideal scene in life?
[02:44:56.719 --> 02:44:57.460]  Okay.
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:45:00.704]  Ideal scene is someone not having to take anti-psychotic drugs.
[02:45:00.804 --> 02:45:01.385]  I would agree.
[02:45:01.405 --> 02:45:01.645]  Okay.
[02:45:01.685 --> 02:45:07.812]  So, now you look at, you go, okay, a departure from that ideal scene is someone taking drugs.
[02:45:08.433 --> 02:45:08.713]  Okay.
[02:45:08.974 --> 02:45:11.677]  And then you go, okay, what is the theory and the science behind that?
[02:45:12.631 --> 02:45:13.572]  That justifies that.
[02:45:13.832 --> 02:45:18.915]  Let me take this more general, because I think you and I could go around in circles on this for a while, and I respect your opinion on it.
[02:45:19.135 --> 02:45:21.857]  Do you want more people to understand Scientology?
[02:45:21.897 --> 02:45:22.998]  Would that be a goal of yours?
[02:45:23.018 --> 02:45:23.398]  You know what?
[02:45:24.398 --> 02:45:24.939]  Absolutely.
[02:45:25.159 --> 02:45:25.539]  Of course.
[02:45:25.959 --> 02:45:26.780]  How do you go about that?
[02:45:27.060 --> 02:45:28.041]  You just communicate about it.
[02:45:28.061 --> 02:45:34.485]  And the important thing is, you and I talk about it, whether it's... Look, if I want to know something, I go and find out.
[02:45:34.525 --> 02:45:36.966]  Because I don't talk about things that I don't understand.
[02:45:37.026 --> 02:45:37.787]  I'll say, you know what?
[02:45:38.402 --> 02:45:39.382]  I'm not so sure about that.
[02:45:39.482 --> 02:45:47.265]  I'll go find more information about it so I can come to an opinion based on the information that I have.
[02:45:47.346 --> 02:45:48.766]  You're so passionate about it.
[02:45:49.326 --> 02:45:50.407]  I'm passionate about learning.
[02:45:50.727 --> 02:45:52.107]  I'm passionate about life, Matt.
[02:45:54.848 --> 02:46:03.232]  So, again, now see it's, oh, you're a Scientologist if you're against all the drugging and the New Freedom Initiative and the rest of it, and that's what's happening here.
[02:46:03.252 --> 02:46:06.473]  I have an article here out of the Associated Press where they admit
[02:46:07.276 --> 02:46:15.142]  That they brutally beat up women, rape them, threaten to rape them, you name it, and have them go confess on TV that they're terrorists, and they admit it's totally fake and staged.
[02:46:15.182 --> 02:46:15.843]  That's going on.
[02:46:16.103 --> 02:46:18.645]  That's the running man TV our government puts on in Iraq.
[02:46:19.846 --> 02:46:23.308]  Another AP article, judges use anklet bracelets to check sobriety.
[02:46:23.648 --> 02:46:28.592]  Oh, you're accused of drunk driving, so we're going to make you wear a bracelet to see if you are drinking before you're convicted.
[02:46:29.593 --> 02:46:30.754]  Talk about a brave new world.
[02:46:30.794 --> 02:46:31.454]  They even admit it.
[02:46:31.474 --> 02:46:34.857]  They call it brave new world big brother, but it's good, they say.
[02:46:35.862 --> 02:46:40.345]  Speaking of drugs, TV has negative impact on very young children's learning abilities.
[02:46:40.845 --> 02:46:44.908]  Television viewing before the age of 3 may have adverse effects on the subsequent cognitive development.
[02:46:44.928 --> 02:46:58.577]  According to a study in the July issue of Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, one of the JAMA Archive journals, 3 to 5 year old children watch an average of 2 or more hours of television or videos per day.
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:04.903]  And it has just a huge effect on the way the brain operates and has serious cognitive effects.
[02:47:05.663 --> 02:47:07.925]  Another major study, I see one of these every month.
[02:47:08.965 --> 02:47:09.926]  Here's another article.
[02:47:10.826 --> 02:47:16.510]  Democratic leader defends push to abolish presidential term limits, rebukes fears of Bush for life.
[02:47:17.230 --> 02:47:25.315]  The Democrats number two in the House, Majority Whip Hoyer, has defended a push to end presidential term limits.
[02:47:26.358 --> 02:47:32.341]  And told the raw story that concern in the blogosphere that the proposal could mean Bush for life is baseless.
[02:47:32.381 --> 02:47:33.082]  He supports it.
[02:47:33.122 --> 02:47:33.342]  Yeah.
[02:47:33.702 --> 02:47:35.123]  So we'll have Bill Clinton for life.
[02:47:35.183 --> 02:47:36.683]  I mean, it's just pure evil, folks.
[02:47:38.763 --> 02:47:44.867]  Here's the Iraqi, uh, says security forces use torture out of AP about stuff I can't even mention on air, folks.
[02:47:44.947 --> 02:47:48.650]  It's just getting, it's just getting so out of control, so bad.
[02:47:48.950 --> 02:47:53.053]  Venezuelan's President Chavez says free trade area of the Americas is dead.
[02:47:53.093 --> 02:47:55.514]  Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has declared the U.S.
[02:47:55.554 --> 02:47:58.196]  proposed hemispheric trade block is dead and should be buried.
[02:47:58.576 --> 02:48:01.918]  Proposal that the United States first made ten years ago is absolutely impractical.
[02:48:02.259 --> 02:48:04.140]  That Chavez is referring to the free trade area of the Americas.
[02:48:04.730 --> 02:48:08.372]  They went on to say that it would give up some of their sovereignty and just isn't a good idea.
[02:48:08.832 --> 02:48:13.855]  Talking about Fox News propaganda, you should turn the audio off and just look at the video.
[02:48:13.895 --> 02:48:16.656]  We have screenshots of this on Prison Planet and InfoWars.
[02:48:18.597 --> 02:48:21.099]  Fox assures us Bush Supreme Court pick will be honest.
[02:48:21.179 --> 02:48:22.339]  It says Fox Facts.
[02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:25.901]  Bush nominee will interpret Constitution faithfully.
[02:48:26.282 --> 02:48:26.982]  Fox Facts.
[02:48:27.062 --> 02:48:30.024]  Bush will nominate person with integrity and intellect.
[02:48:31.024 --> 02:48:32.305]  See, it's all the subliminal stuff.
[02:48:33.047 --> 02:48:35.168]  They're in your face talking about the dangers of TV.
[02:48:35.788 --> 02:48:42.871]  That's why I can officially say I make TV and watch a few pieces of propaganda, but I do not watch it for enjoyment.
[02:48:43.492 --> 02:48:43.952]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.894 --> 02:48:47.415]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.595 --> 02:48:50.676]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.796 --> 02:48:54.717]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.757 --> 02:48:58.999]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.339 --> 02:49:03.100]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.240 --> 02:49:05.041]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.621 --> 02:49:08.542]  Police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.582 --> 02:49:13.304]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.464 --> 02:49:16.505]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.685 --> 02:49:19.546]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.026 --> 02:49:26.148]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.688 --> 02:49:30.490]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:49:30.870 --> 02:49:32.251]  Order your video today.
[02:49:32.631 --> 02:49:33.712]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.

[02:49:45.057 --> 02:49:52.563]  Get the new Berkey Battery Adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:52.843 --> 02:50:03.751]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:04.011 --> 02:50:05.834]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:50:06.094 --> 02:50:09.418]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:09.759 --> 02:50:11.101]  But it's worth every penny.
[02:50:11.221 --> 02:50:20.213]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:20.513 --> 02:50:20.993]  That's right!
[02:50:21.173 --> 02:50:28.295]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.595 --> 02:50:32.717]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.

[02:51:36.265 --> 02:51:36.845]  Call now!
[02:51:36.985 --> 02:51:38.667]  Oh, a few little program notes here.
[02:51:57.071 --> 02:51:58.032]  We've got David Icke.
[02:51:58.112 --> 02:51:58.592]  You've got him.
[02:51:58.632 --> 02:51:59.132]  You've got him.
[02:51:59.212 --> 02:52:00.953]  Two hours next Monday.
[02:52:02.614 --> 02:52:04.295]  David Icke talking about his new book.
[02:52:04.335 --> 02:52:05.095]  Interesting fellow.
[02:52:05.835 --> 02:52:06.736]  Will be joining us.
[02:52:06.756 --> 02:52:08.016]  We appreciate him taking the time out.
[02:52:08.096 --> 02:52:10.478]  Two hours coming up next Monday.
[02:52:10.498 --> 02:52:15.540]  We've got a lot of other big guests coming up later this week on Thursday and Friday.
[02:52:15.560 --> 02:52:23.404]  So you'll definitely want to be checking in and normally by the early morning hours we post who the guests are going to be on the day of the event.
[02:52:24.617 --> 02:52:39.224]  I'm going to try to get to where we post people in advance, though, because a lot of folks want to know about that, but usually we have a lot of guests on as things are developing, as things are happening, but I always enjoy just opening the phones up and taking your calls, like we did today, and I try to do that once or twice a week, at least once a week, on average.
[02:52:40.444 --> 02:52:43.946]  Before I hit a smattering of other key final news items here,
[02:52:46.067 --> 02:52:52.671]  Number one, remember, we've got to fight the Gonzalez nomination for the Attorney General to become the Supreme Court Justice.
[02:52:52.691 --> 02:52:53.792]  We've got to expose that.
[02:52:53.852 --> 02:52:58.695]  I heard, after my show yesterday, USA Radio Network going, the liberals are fighting him.
[02:52:58.735 --> 02:52:59.916]  Don't let the liberals win.
[02:52:59.936 --> 02:53:02.798]  They actually had some guy on there, as if that was news.
[02:53:02.878 --> 02:53:04.699]  I mean, the liberals.
[02:53:05.159 --> 02:53:06.720]  So you're a liberal if you're against gun control.
[02:53:07.621 --> 02:53:08.741]  Or if you're against abortion.
[02:53:08.761 --> 02:53:09.702]  This is the spin.
[02:53:09.722 --> 02:53:12.624]  They use the left-to-right paradigm to shift off our thinking process.
[02:53:14.019 --> 02:53:20.664]  To shatter the false left-right paradigm with my new film, Marshall Law 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[02:53:20.684 --> 02:53:21.925]  It is a mini-series.
[02:53:22.565 --> 02:53:24.927]  It is a little over three hours long.
[02:53:25.708 --> 02:53:31.972]  You need to have this video, the latest 9-11 information, put together the most professionally I've ever done a film.
[02:53:33.093 --> 02:53:38.417]  The latest police state, who the globalists are, the Bush-Nazi connections, the connections to the occult.
[02:53:39.578 --> 02:53:40.659]  Such an important film.
[02:53:41.701 --> 02:53:42.542]  It won't be seen.
[02:53:42.562 --> 02:53:46.945]  It won't have the effect it could have if you don't order it.
[02:53:47.706 --> 02:53:52.509]  We've got discounts of upwards of 75% off on some of my videos when you get multiple copies.
[02:53:52.970 --> 02:53:56.472]  So when you call the toll-free number or when you go to the website, be sure to look at the specials.
[02:53:57.033 --> 02:54:01.976]  The toll-free number to call and get Martial Law or any of the books and videos I carry or films I produce is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:08.419 --> 02:54:11.080]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:54:11.620 --> 02:54:20.663]  Or go to InfoWars.com to watch clips of the films, read about the films, look at all the different specials, and to order via the safe, secure shopping cart.
[02:54:20.703 --> 02:54:21.963]  That's InfoWars.com.
[02:54:22.383 --> 02:54:26.885]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv, get a 15 cent a day monthly or yearly subscription.
[02:54:27.976 --> 02:54:30.838]  And you can see all the films, the weekly TV reports.
[02:54:30.938 --> 02:54:32.179]  It's a ridiculous deal.
[02:54:32.580 --> 02:54:33.540]  Just go check it out.
[02:54:33.580 --> 02:54:34.761]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:54:35.482 --> 02:54:37.503]  Bush administration annexes the Internet.
[02:54:37.523 --> 02:54:39.144]  They're not giving over the root servers.
[02:54:39.625 --> 02:54:43.267]  And if they don't update those and upgrade those, Internet 1 will begin crashing.
[02:54:43.688 --> 02:54:51.253]  They're going to force us over to Internet 2 that is highly regulated and controlled, where you'll be able to have a domain on a sub-carrier, if they allow you.

[02:55:07.104 --> 02:55:09.426]  And they're going to force London drivers to take that.

[02:55:46.753 --> 02:55:53.156]  Yes, more guns means more freedom and more tyrants that are afraid to move too strongly against us.
[02:55:54.297 --> 02:55:55.357]  We're going to win this fight.
[02:55:55.377 --> 02:55:58.559]  We're going to defend the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[02:55:59.639 --> 02:56:01.040]  Keep your eyes on the prize.
