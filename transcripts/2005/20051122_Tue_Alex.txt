[00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:06.414]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:08.135]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:09.936]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.616 --> 00:00:11.396]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.177 --> 00:00:13.077]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:17.479]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.001]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:32.962]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:33.102 --> 00:00:44.190]  It is Tuesday, the 22nd day of November 2005, as we accelerate towards Thanksgiving coming up this Thursday.
[00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:45.992]  Well, the end of the year.
[00:00:46.092 --> 00:00:47.493]  Christmas is right up ahead.
[00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.127]  I know you tune in to get that vital information.
[00:00:51.147 --> 00:00:56.108]  Yes, Thanksgiving is in two and a half days, or two days, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:56.848 --> 00:00:59.228]  Christmas is coming up on the 25th of next month.
[00:00:59.988 --> 00:01:01.049]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:13.271]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours, and we have a prolific journalist, researcher, blogger, Kurt Nemo, joining us, coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:15.292]  We will have open phones.
[00:01:15.332 --> 00:01:16.532]  I've had a lot of guests on lately.
[00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:19.030]  Not today, just one guest.
[00:01:19.645 --> 00:01:48.202]  We will have open phones in the first hour and a half, and in the second half of the broadcast as well, with Kurt Nemo talking about any issue, any news item, the torture, what's happening with the economy, what's going on with energy prices starting to fall, the different developments with the war drums being beaten violently right now to attack Iran and Syria, with the globalist engaging in destabilization operations in both of those countries.
[00:01:49.028 --> 00:01:52.011]  You're welcome to call in about any issue you wish.
[00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:53.472]  Toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:53.492 --> 00:01:55.434]  1-800-259-9231 and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:01:55.454 --> 00:01:59.597]  I mentioned this yesterday, but I want to spend some time on it in this first hour.
[00:02:09.648 --> 00:02:13.410]  Newt Gingrich sees Iran's threat to U.S.
[00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:23.594]  like Nazi Germany and X-Speaker is the latest official to raise alarm of threat of nuclear EMP attack by Tehran, by Iran.
[00:02:24.358 --> 00:02:42.033]  That's, again, akin to saying Bugs Bunny's got the death ray on the moon and he's fighting with Marvin the Martian trying to keep him from destroying the Earth with his strontium-9, my strontium-12 detonator to destroy the Earth, you pesky Earth creature!
[00:02:42.053 --> 00:02:45.997]  It's just fairy tales, just like the bird flu.
[00:02:46.397 --> 00:02:49.640]  Top scientists worldwide saying that it is, quote,
[00:02:50.294 --> 00:02:54.176]  A fairytale, an urban legend, what's the other term they used?
[00:02:54.356 --> 00:02:55.997]  Science fiction!
[00:02:57.038 --> 00:02:57.558]  Iran!
[00:02:57.618 --> 00:03:07.364]  It's just like those drones in Saddam had death cannons and rail guns that would shoot thousands of miles and kill everyone and
[00:03:09.157 --> 00:03:13.920]  On and on and on, and he's going to nuke us in 45 minutes, and he's got nuclear reactors.
[00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.160]  Why, we found the evidence.
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.861]  They were buried under a rose bush.
[00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:20.903]  Yes, an entire complex for purifying uranium.
[00:03:22.804 --> 00:03:30.188]  Takes up several dozen football fields in size, several floors deep, but no, a small four-inch-round sphere.
[00:03:30.588 --> 00:03:32.369]  Why, it's the proof they need.
[00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.671]  The same crowd that's lied to us over and over again.
[00:03:36.844 --> 00:03:41.507]  Is now giving us more intelligence of impending EMP blast.
[00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:44.149]  And look, I'm not saying some deadly virus won't be released.
[00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.590]  I'm not saying that an EMP won't knock us out.
[00:03:47.291 --> 00:03:53.395]  But I'll guarantee you from past examples and research, and what we know about the globalists, it isn't going to be Tehran.
[00:03:54.816 --> 00:04:01.601]  And meanwhile, one of the other organs of propaganda, hot on nudie seals, Washington Times, U.S.
[00:04:01.621 --> 00:04:05.884]  seen vulnerable to space pulse attack by Bill Gertz.
[00:04:05.964 --> 00:04:11.848]  Say, Bill, did you ever report on all the paid reporters for the CIA and for the federal government?
[00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:13.369]  I wonder why you never wrote about that, Bill.
[00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.990]  You ought to do a story about that, Bill Gertz.
[00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:17.331]  Oh, you're so conservative.
[00:04:17.551 --> 00:04:20.312]  You talked about supercomputer and missile secrets to China under Clinton.
[00:04:20.572 --> 00:04:24.714]  Bush eclipses all of that, dwarfs all of it, and there ain't no word out of you, Billy Boy.
[00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:26.354]  Yeah.
[00:04:27.735 --> 00:04:29.516]  So, we'll get into that, Bill Gertz.
[00:04:29.596 --> 00:04:31.857]  Why, it's the death ray.
[00:04:32.517 --> 00:04:33.877]  We're all in deep trouble.
[00:04:35.478 --> 00:04:37.359]  Meanwhile, our government all over the country has
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.704]  Flu viruses, 39,000 times stronger than anything ever known.
[00:04:42.744 --> 00:04:44.967]  And they're shipping them around to anybody that wants them.
[00:04:44.987 --> 00:04:50.572]  And mailing out weaponized pathogens of every conceivable type and combination.
[00:04:50.592 --> 00:04:51.453]  Not a problem.
[00:04:51.513 --> 00:04:51.813]  No, no.
[00:04:52.054 --> 00:04:53.195]  The death ray.
[00:04:53.555 --> 00:04:55.237]  The death ray.
[00:04:55.257 --> 00:04:57.179]  Oh, the bird flu.
[00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:58.460]  Give up all your rights.
[00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.061]  Newt will save us.
[00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:00.402]  Newt!
[00:05:02.682 --> 00:05:05.525]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:07.367]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.707 --> 00:05:12.372]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.732 --> 00:05:19.459]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.779 --> 00:05:21.760]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.961 --> 00:05:24.802]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:29.566]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.766 --> 00:05:34.169]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:41.654]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.894 --> 00:05:44.315]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:01.661 --> 00:06:05.143]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:06:05.423 --> 00:06:08.924]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:09.024 --> 00:06:12.946]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:13.166 --> 00:06:19.349]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:27.653]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:33.397]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:33.558 --> 00:06:37.341]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:39.542]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:06:39.622 --> 00:06:41.784]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:05.400]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.561]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:11.643]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:18.526]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:07:53.726 --> 00:07:54.908]  Osama Bin Forgotten.

[00:08:02.114 --> 00:08:07.718]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.282 --> 00:08:16.404]  All right, eight minutes into this hour, second segment.
[00:08:16.444 --> 00:08:19.166]  It is the 22nd day of November 2005.
[00:08:19.527 --> 00:08:23.510]  We're going to be live here for the next two hours and 51 and a half minutes.
[00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:26.352]  Kurt Nemo, prolific researcher and writer,
[00:08:28.584 --> 00:08:37.291]  Extraordinaire will be joining us coming up in the middle of the broadcast in about an hour and a half for the balance of this transmission against tyranny.
[00:08:39.005 --> 00:09:01.446]  The former number two man at Treasury and major editor for huge publications like the Wall Street Journal, Paul Craig Roberts, has written several more devastating articles exposing the psychopathic criminal nature of those controlling the Bush administration and he's likening them to the communists and fascists of old
[00:09:02.507 --> 00:09:08.431]  And yes, pointing the finger at them, saying they clearly could carry out terror attacks in the near future.
[00:09:08.791 --> 00:09:14.595]  Ray McGovern, Chief CIA Analyst for Ronald Reagan and Bush Sr., briefed them every morning.
[00:09:15.516 --> 00:09:16.257]  Says the same thing.
[00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:22.701]  So many countless people are now going public and speaking out and telling the truth.
[00:09:22.721 --> 00:09:27.064]  And that's because they know that America is on the verge of execution.
[00:09:28.522 --> 00:09:36.047]  They've already beaten us, they've whipped us with the cat-or-nine-tails, they have broken innumerable bones in this once great country.
[00:09:36.908 --> 00:09:49.897]  We have been debilitated, we have been starved, we have been emaciated, we have been castrated, we have been emasculated, and they are preparing for the coup de grace to literally draw and quarter this nation.
[00:09:50.751 --> 00:10:04.623]  They have openly announced their plans to do it in a hundred journals plus, in white papers, and they are openly engaging in their one world government plan as the general public literally drools mindlessly watching television.
[00:10:06.985 --> 00:10:16.913]  So we'll be going over that today, but I mean, really folks, the globalists are arrogant, even though their entire agenda is being exposed, because they know anytime they want, they've got
[00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:25.355]  They have multiple plans in the pike ready to be activated instantly to detonate suitcase nukes in this country.
[00:10:25.915 --> 00:10:31.719]  They can flip a switch and release chemical and biological and radiological weapons.
[00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:41.245]  They have drones on the ground ready, fueled with the knockout gases to literally knock out or kill entire U.S.
[00:10:41.285 --> 00:10:41.646]  cities.
[00:10:41.886 --> 00:10:43.267]  That's even been declassified.
[00:10:44.447 --> 00:10:46.469]  They are totally prepared
[00:10:47.293 --> 00:10:48.394]  And that's why they're arrogant.
[00:10:48.774 --> 00:11:00.520]  But just because they have the power to do a thing, and just because they have the will, at least on the surface, to do a thing, doesn't mean that even that ultimate move won't blow up in their faces.
[00:11:01.241 --> 00:11:13.668]  If, in the midst of the even greater calamities to come, it is a byword, an understanding point, a point that is fully understood and grasped,
[00:11:14.008 --> 00:11:27.133]  That the globalists have been behind the terror, they've been caught red-handed hundreds of times, they have the motive for the terror, all the evidence shows they have been behind the past terror, and will be behind that current terrorism.
[00:11:28.554 --> 00:11:35.056]  I ask the police out there, if you've caught someone robbing banks 25 times and they've gotten out of prison after a 10 year stint,
[00:11:35.909 --> 00:11:54.074]  and uh... the eyewitnesses fingers someone who looks just like that individual and then you go to the individual's home and there is the actual loot, there is the marked bills and why even a drawn-up schematic of how to break into the vault are you gonna just uh... ignore that individual and let them go free?
[00:11:55.291 --> 00:12:02.839]  Our government over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again has been caught.
[00:12:02.919 --> 00:12:04.120]  It has been declassified.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:10.667]  Braggs admits, openly talks about the fact that they've carried out terror attacks since at least
[00:12:11.908 --> 00:12:23.561]  1953, to blame it on their political enemies to overthrow governments, and they've even done it here in the United States, they've done it to our own ships, our own military bases, they have done it time and time again.
[00:12:23.581 --> 00:12:28.586]  And why you mindlessly serve this group of hijackers, I'll never understand.
[00:12:29.548 --> 00:12:32.491]  Here's another example, another parallel, another analogy.
[00:12:34.341 --> 00:12:41.363]  You're on board a plane, and five Arab men with submachine guns, somehow they snuck on, hijack it.
[00:12:41.943 --> 00:12:45.744]  And you're ready, as an air marshal in the back, that they're not aware of.
[00:12:46.444 --> 00:12:48.724]  There's two air marshals on board, you've got your handguns.
[00:12:49.385 --> 00:12:52.525]  You're waiting for an opportune moment to take the plane back from them.
[00:12:53.586 --> 00:12:54.666]  But something happens.
[00:12:55.706 --> 00:13:04.740]  The hijackers go into the flight cabin, into the cockpit, and they put on, for some reason, the uniforms of the pilots.
[00:13:06.224 --> 00:13:09.126]  And they walk out and they say, we are no longer hijackers.
[00:13:09.406 --> 00:13:15.691]  They lay down their Uzis and they say, we are American Airlines pilots.
[00:13:15.931 --> 00:13:17.172]  We are continental pilots.
[00:13:17.472 --> 00:13:19.293]  And you go, oh, they're wearing uniforms.
[00:13:19.794 --> 00:13:20.914]  They're wearing our uniforms.
[00:13:20.975 --> 00:13:23.116]  Here, I'm going to lay my gun down too.
[00:13:23.296 --> 00:13:23.957]  I love you.
[00:13:24.597 --> 00:13:26.218]  Take us wherever you like, Captain.
[00:13:26.739 --> 00:13:28.140]  You're in official control.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.141]  That's all it is.
[00:13:30.401 --> 00:13:33.083]  We have hijackers that have hijacked our government.
[00:13:34.464 --> 00:13:35.725]  And it's not like it's a secret anymore.
[00:13:37.003 --> 00:13:45.630]  They have programs on C-SPAN where the Naval War College puts on a symposium with their top brain going, we are now part of a global government.
[00:13:46.971 --> 00:13:52.114]  We are working for Madison Avenue and Wall Street and as part of a great global system.
[00:13:52.875 --> 00:13:58.099]  And America is now going into this great system and we are there to back up those financial interests.
[00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:00.581]  And rights and liberties will have to be given up!
[00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:03.403]  I mean, they don't even hide it anymore!
[00:14:04.153 --> 00:14:18.626]  They call us slaves, they call us stupid, they talk about how they're going to lower our standard of living, and then... Now that's in communiques and publications and strategy and battle plan documents that are all public.
[00:14:20.129 --> 00:14:35.236]  Written by the CFR and the PNAC boys and the Virginia Brzezinskis and the Rand Corporations of the world, and they'll put some flowery statements in the opening pages in the introduction, but when you get right down to it, they will snicker and giggle and call us slaves and everything else.
[00:14:36.556 --> 00:14:40.038]  And how it's better for us small-minded people to have all our freedoms taken.
[00:14:40.358 --> 00:14:41.619]  After all, that's the best thing.
[00:14:41.639 --> 00:14:47.001]  And the reason I'm off on this rant today, before I even plunge into the news and take your calls,
[00:14:48.709 --> 00:14:52.790]  It's because I was talking to a fella who's in Air Force Intelligence yesterday.
[00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.310]  Successful businessman here in Austin.
[00:14:55.791 --> 00:14:56.431]  Nice guy.
[00:14:57.311 --> 00:14:58.871]  On the surface, that's what's so scary about it.
[00:14:59.171 --> 00:15:03.912]  They aren't all just people going, they did find the WMD'ers.
[00:15:04.752 --> 00:15:06.593]  That Al-Qaeda's gonna get it.
[00:15:07.533 --> 00:15:08.933]  Oh, well, where's Iraq on a map?
[00:15:09.173 --> 00:15:11.314]  Oh, don't ask me that, you idiot.
[00:15:11.954 --> 00:15:14.955]  What are you, some kind of fancy guy who reads books?
[00:15:14.975 --> 00:15:16.535]  We got one that can read over here.
[00:15:17.256 --> 00:15:18.318]  They're not all like that.
[00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:22.265]  Clean-cut, well-spoken, family man, real serious.
[00:15:23.888 --> 00:15:28.577]  And you sit there and have a discussion with them and it's just the thinking process is switched off.
[00:15:29.685 --> 00:15:30.766]  Well, I've set my course.
[00:15:30.826 --> 00:15:32.047]  I'm dedicated to this.
[00:15:32.987 --> 00:15:33.868]  The government isn't perfect.
[00:15:33.908 --> 00:15:34.588]  We all know that.
[00:15:34.628 --> 00:15:36.689]  But we've just got to go ahead and attack Iran.
[00:15:37.190 --> 00:15:38.090]  It's the thing to do.
[00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:42.553]  And we're just going to have to go in there real soon because they're trying to blackmail our precious little Israel.
[00:15:42.613 --> 00:15:45.835]  And yes, they've got the death ray, basically.
[00:15:45.855 --> 00:15:52.819]  They've got the EMP bomb, which our government detonated literally hundreds of them in the upper and lower atmosphere.
[00:15:54.551 --> 00:15:55.332]  The History Channel.
[00:15:55.372 --> 00:16:00.395]  I've got an hour-long special just every minute a new blast.
[00:16:01.596 --> 00:16:16.646]  It shows them firing, you know, in one night something like 20-something high-powered hydrogen bombs into the atmosphere and detonating them in the Van Allen radiation belt, detonating them in the different levels.
[00:16:16.726 --> 00:16:18.868]  And yeah, a few things blew out here and there.
[00:16:18.928 --> 00:16:20.349]  They found it's really a ripple effect.
[00:16:20.789 --> 00:16:23.811]  Something a thousand miles away might blow out, but stuff right under you won't.
[00:16:25.425 --> 00:16:26.926]  Just way overhyped.
[00:16:27.287 --> 00:16:28.147]  I mean, our own government.
[00:16:28.167 --> 00:16:30.449]  You talking about... You worried about Iran doing this?
[00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:34.613]  I mean, I've got the video of our government just firing them.
[00:16:35.093 --> 00:16:37.815]  Just, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew, pew.
[00:16:37.855 --> 00:16:39.837]  These big SAM missiles taking off.
[00:16:40.097 --> 00:16:44.241]  And boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:16:44.801 --> 00:16:47.623]  These EMPs blasting up there in the atmosphere.
[00:16:48.865 --> 00:16:50.286]  And of course, we all get to breathe it then.
[00:16:51.727 --> 00:16:54.029]  But, uh, it's just general craziness.
[00:16:54.972 --> 00:17:00.374]  And now they're saying, oh no, they've got it, we're all dead, but I don't know, there's a phenomenon.
[00:17:00.394 --> 00:17:21.660]  I had all these things I wanted to say on air about talking to that guy yesterday in person for about 15 minutes, and then I get in here on air and it all just kind of goes by the wayside, but just sitting there talking to him, I said, but Bill Clinton gave supercomputers and metal secrets to China, but Bush took all the restrictions off, and
[00:17:23.101 --> 00:17:24.082]  I said, did you know about that?
[00:17:24.122 --> 00:17:25.904]  He goes, yeah, I've heard about that.
[00:17:25.924 --> 00:17:26.804]  Yes, I know.
[00:17:26.844 --> 00:17:27.645]  He was very informed.
[00:17:28.306 --> 00:17:30.948]  And I said, but you're not upset with Bush?
[00:17:30.988 --> 00:17:32.429]  He's got Bush stickers all over his car.
[00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:35.712]  Well, you know, lesser of two evils, Alex.
[00:17:35.772 --> 00:17:37.574]  We're given false choices every day.
[00:17:37.594 --> 00:17:39.395]  And I realize it's a false choice.
[00:17:40.036 --> 00:17:41.617]  And I said, do you watch or listen to my show?
[00:17:41.637 --> 00:17:42.078]  And he goes, no.
[00:17:42.759 --> 00:17:43.920]  I've seen you on the news a few times.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.061]  I go, you just said we're given false choices.
[00:17:46.081 --> 00:17:49.723]  He says, yes, it's a false choice, but still, I have to choose one of them.
[00:17:50.203 --> 00:17:51.084]  Well, no, you don't.
[00:17:51.624 --> 00:17:53.886]  Then I'm like, well, they lied to us about WMDs.
[00:17:53.966 --> 00:17:55.847]  Well, certainly it's admitted now that it's false.
[00:17:57.802 --> 00:17:59.523]  But we should still be there?
[00:17:59.543 --> 00:18:00.664]  Yes, we should still be there.
[00:18:00.704 --> 00:18:05.327]  And you know, I was there involved in battle planning before the war and endearing.
[00:18:05.907 --> 00:18:08.288]  Well, what about going into Iran?
[00:18:08.328 --> 00:18:10.130]  Yes, they just won't do what they're told.
[00:18:10.270 --> 00:18:12.151]  Yeah, they're just not slaves.
[00:18:12.171 --> 00:18:12.631]  That's right.
[00:18:14.012 --> 00:18:16.353]  Again, they're allowed to have sovereignty, folks.
[00:18:17.314 --> 00:18:18.455]  So what if they get nukes?
[00:18:19.315 --> 00:18:23.978]  I said, so what if they get nukes as the CIA says they will in ten years if they start working on it now?
[00:18:24.944 --> 00:18:27.125]  Not next month, not two years from now, not five years.
[00:18:27.605 --> 00:18:32.328]  Ten years, multiple MI6 reports, CIA reports, but not the ones you see on the news.
[00:18:32.608 --> 00:18:33.528]  The admitted reports.
[00:18:34.729 --> 00:18:35.449]  They're now public.
[00:18:36.349 --> 00:18:38.671]  And he goes, well, still, it's just too great a threat to Israel.
[00:18:39.251 --> 00:18:40.752]  Well, Israel's got 400 nukes.
[00:18:40.792 --> 00:18:44.373]  Why are they allowed to have 400 nukes and threaten to use them on a routine basis on us?
[00:18:44.633 --> 00:18:50.016]  Somebody in the Knesset last year said, we ought to use these on Europe for what they did in the Holocaust.
[00:18:51.932 --> 00:18:52.733]  What about China?
[00:18:52.773 --> 00:18:55.275]  They say all the time they'll nuke and kill us.
[00:18:55.295 --> 00:18:56.436]  They'll hit 200 cities.
[00:18:56.456 --> 00:18:57.396]  That was just a few months ago.
[00:18:57.797 --> 00:18:59.538]  Well, that's a different scale, isn't it?
[00:18:59.838 --> 00:19:04.241]  They've got the nukes now, and so does North Korea, so we have to use detente with them.
[00:19:05.002 --> 00:19:08.705]  Yeah, but it's mutually assured destruction.
[00:19:10.015 --> 00:19:15.697]  Once Iran even gets nukes, which you can stop them from doing through diplomacy, which they were trying to do.
[00:19:15.717 --> 00:19:19.378]  But the globalists just want war, so it's now being escalated.
[00:19:19.858 --> 00:19:20.878]  And he just shook his head.
[00:19:20.938 --> 00:19:22.619]  Well, we just have to go to war with them.
[00:19:23.899 --> 00:19:25.900]  But they're not saying they want to nuke and kill us.
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:36.263]  The head of the Chinese army said three months ago that they are preparing and will nuke the United States if we mess with any of their interests globally.
[00:19:37.363 --> 00:19:38.944]  And he said, I did read that, yes.
[00:19:40.171 --> 00:19:45.957]  But we're moving all our industry there and all of our technologies and they're outfitting the latest military systems.
[00:19:46.378 --> 00:19:49.321]  Well, Alex, Iran's got to be hit.
[00:19:49.981 --> 00:19:51.763]  Now that's our orders and we're preparing for it.
[00:19:52.164 --> 00:19:54.126]  Just switching off your thinking process.
[00:19:54.866 --> 00:19:58.090]  Working for a pack of criminals that have hijacked the United States.
[00:20:03.763 --> 00:20:10.409]  Do you desire to increase your energy levels and relieve your pain and stress without chemicals, drugs, or expensive supplements?

[00:20:27.731 --> 00:20:29.512]  This is real, not science fiction.

[00:20:49.102 --> 00:20:57.615]  This is Brian David Anderson, researcher and inventor of the TriVortex technology products, wishing you and yours a joyous holiday season.
[00:21:02.205 --> 00:21:03.846]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.966 --> 00:21:08.068]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:08.208 --> 00:21:11.070]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:11.170 --> 00:21:17.874]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:21:18.054 --> 00:21:21.055]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:21.275 --> 00:21:23.657]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:23.797 --> 00:21:26.118]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[00:21:26.118 --> 00:21:26.919]  We're good to go!
[00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:54.618]  Currency devaluation.
[00:21:54.718 --> 00:21:55.458]  Inflation.
[00:21:55.558 --> 00:21:56.919]  One and the same.
[00:21:56.939 --> 00:22:07.661]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:21.621 --> 00:22:24.762]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:25.022 --> 00:22:26.843]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:26.903 --> 00:22:29.924]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:30.464 --> 00:22:32.705]  Here is reality.
[00:22:33.065 --> 00:22:36.647]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:37.127 --> 00:22:40.788]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[00:22:41.349 --> 00:22:43.930]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[00:22:45.532 --> 00:22:49.254]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[00:22:49.614 --> 00:22:50.775]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:50.795 --> 00:22:51.015]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:07.002]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:23:07.282 --> 00:23:10.864]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:23:11.004 --> 00:23:19.148]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:23:19.388 --> 00:23:25.031]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:23:25.331 --> 00:23:30.577]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:23:30.838 --> 00:23:32.920]  This is why you need the Filter Mag.
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:45.335]  The Filter Mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:23:45.555 --> 00:23:49.998]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:23:50.198 --> 00:23:51.159]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:51.339 --> 00:23:52.960]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:54.201]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:23:54.221 --> 00:23:54.481]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:55.021]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:55.522]  What is it called?
[00:24:15.267 --> 00:24:22.652]  What's the term for it when you're intelligent, and you've got the gifts that God gave you, but you're not using them.
[00:24:22.672 --> 00:24:24.914]  You just decide to willfully be ignorant.
[00:24:25.194 --> 00:24:29.237]  Well, I've chosen my course, and so I'm going to stick to it.
[00:24:29.277 --> 00:24:37.363]  You know, so many of the Nazi officers, so many of the German Wehrmacht, were not what you call overtly evil people.
[00:24:37.643 --> 00:24:42.807]  They were dogishly servants to that evil system.
[00:24:44.105 --> 00:24:45.246]  They were clean cut.
[00:24:45.306 --> 00:24:47.648]  They wouldn't cheat on their taxes.
[00:24:47.748 --> 00:24:49.009]  They were family men.
[00:24:49.069 --> 00:24:50.891]  They went to church every Sunday.
[00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:54.914]  They wore impeccable uniforms.
[00:24:54.994 --> 00:24:58.797]  They had little gardens in the backyard and little puppies they loved.
[00:24:59.838 --> 00:25:02.380]  But they would do whatever they were told.
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:03.221]  It didn't matter.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.501]  This is well documented.
[00:25:07.661 --> 00:25:16.050]  One of the last orders Hitler gave was that there were millions of Germans down in the subway system, down in the underground railway system under the city.
[00:25:17.071 --> 00:25:25.339]  And the Russians were closing in just about a half mile away from the Eagle's Nest a few days before he finally blew his head off down in the bunker.
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.801]  And Hitler said, flood!
[00:25:28.262 --> 00:25:28.702]  Flood the
[00:25:30.322 --> 00:25:34.727]  Underground passages, flood the shelters, flood the railway system.
[00:25:34.747 --> 00:25:37.490]  And they said, sir, that's where the people are, the women and children.
[00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:38.491]  He said, they are weak!
[00:25:38.951 --> 00:25:40.032]  They do not deserve it!
[00:25:40.293 --> 00:25:41.254]  Kill them!
[00:25:41.834 --> 00:25:44.117]  And German soldiers, Heil Hitler!
[00:25:44.517 --> 00:25:46.419]  And they went in there and they flooded those Germans.
[00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:48.721]  I mean, that's just the mindlessness.
[00:25:49.622 --> 00:25:52.946]  Albert Speer, Speer refused to do it, by the way.
[00:25:56.167 --> 00:25:56.407]  I don't
[00:26:15.234 --> 00:26:17.415]  He'll probably end up getting to that type of point.
[00:26:17.756 --> 00:26:29.383]  Whether it's Hillary Clinton in 08, or Condi Rice, one of those evil women, or whether it's Schwarzenegger down the line, or Jeb Bush, who swore he'd never run for president, and now has started up his exploratory committee.
[00:26:32.205 --> 00:26:33.025]  This is scary.
[00:26:34.346 --> 00:26:35.927]  And people are so committed.
[00:26:36.738 --> 00:26:38.278]  They've openly lied to us.
[00:26:38.338 --> 00:26:41.439]  We have the memos where they said they were going to lie to us.
[00:26:41.779 --> 00:26:44.320]  Where they said it was a lie premeditatedly.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:50.661]  You ignored it when all these administration officials quit or resigned or were fired and then they go public.
[00:26:51.542 --> 00:26:55.623]  You ignored the torture and denied the torture when Rick Bacchus refused to torture.
[00:26:56.663 --> 00:26:58.503]  He was, by the way, a well-known conservative.
[00:26:59.143 --> 00:26:59.984]  A well-known conservative.
[00:27:00.024 --> 00:27:02.884]  He wasn't some liberal out to get the bushes.
[00:27:04.065 --> 00:27:05.625]  In fact, the real critics
[00:27:06.987 --> 00:27:08.828]  of the Bush administration are conservatives.
[00:27:09.148 --> 00:27:17.311]  If you look at the Democrats, they will attack Bush on petty issues, because they can't attack him on substantive issues, because they're all involved up to their eyeballs with him.
[00:27:17.371 --> 00:27:21.293]  They're owned by the same individuals, by this corporate system.
[00:27:21.673 --> 00:27:31.217]  Here's another example, and then we'll go to break, and I promise we'll go right to Darren, Jeff, Patrick, Michael, Eddie in England, and James in Kentucky, and others.
[00:27:31.257 --> 00:27:32.758]  I'll go right to your calls in the next segment.
[00:27:33.258 --> 00:27:36.219]  But I was listening to Derry Brownfield this morning, driving into the studio,
[00:27:37.182 --> 00:27:41.425]  They get ready for the show, and a caller called in.
[00:27:41.445 --> 00:27:49.672]  They were complaining about Walmart running a monopoly or an oligopoly to drive down the price of eggs to below production cost.
[00:27:50.993 --> 00:28:05.765]  And how, and this is what they do with everything else, then the major egg producers, because they're 36% of the market now globally, even more in the U.S., about half, have to sell them at below price, and they just pass that on to everybody else that buys from them.
[00:28:07.629 --> 00:28:10.951]  And how it's literally bankrupting most of the egg farmers around the country.
[00:28:11.411 --> 00:28:17.134]  And a guy called in and said, you know what, I don't mean to sound like a cruel person, but this is free market.
[00:28:17.414 --> 00:28:18.934]  What, are you a socialist?
[00:28:20.135 --> 00:28:28.759]  Folks, free market isn't when you have a conglomerate that leverages and uses mafia tactics to shut down the economy.
[00:28:29.634 --> 00:28:43.265]  Free market isn't when Walmart owns over 700, this is mainstream news two years ago, I'm sure it's more now, 700 slave camps where the dormitories and prisons are built right on to the factories.
[00:28:44.746 --> 00:28:46.988]  Working 18, 16, 18 hours a day.
[00:28:48.209 --> 00:28:54.734]  It isn't free market when you and I are competing against over 2 million private prisoners in the United States.
[00:28:55.626 --> 00:29:00.831]  There's over 7 million in the system, but over 2 million that are working in prison industries.
[00:29:01.411 --> 00:29:08.317]  You didn't free market to compete against somebody who's working for 20 cents an hour, and then your tax money subsidizes the factory and everything.
[00:29:08.517 --> 00:29:09.498]  That isn't free market.
[00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:10.819]  Okay?
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:14.823]  So just for that guy out there, I wish you'd call into my... See, it's labels.
[00:29:15.083 --> 00:29:22.630]  You grab a label, and then you think... It'd be like if I went around and I had the money to buy up all the car dealerships in the country.
[00:29:23.542 --> 00:29:25.364]  And then I've jacked up the price on you.
[00:29:26.084 --> 00:29:28.246]  And then you didn't... It's the opposite of free market.
[00:29:28.266 --> 00:29:29.127]  Do you understand that?
[00:29:29.508 --> 00:29:30.328]  Do you understand that?
[00:29:33.131 --> 00:29:34.372]  I mean, it's like naptas.
[00:29:34.792 --> 00:29:36.033]  Thousands of pages long.
[00:29:36.113 --> 00:29:38.175]  Takes four wheelbarrows to carry it all.
[00:29:39.477 --> 00:29:40.958]  Just tens of thousands of pages long.
[00:29:40.998 --> 00:29:41.919]  That's not free market.
[00:29:42.159 --> 00:29:45.782]  It's written for the global corporations to leverage out their competition.
[00:29:45.842 --> 00:29:47.604]  You and I, the small businessman and woman.
[00:29:48.164 --> 00:29:48.445]  Wake up!
[00:29:51.869 --> 00:29:54.853]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.794 --> 00:29:58.457]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.344 --> 00:30:08.688]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:08.908 --> 00:30:13.931]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:30:14.251 --> 00:30:22.156]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:22.316 --> 00:30:29.360]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.781]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:30.921 --> 00:30:34.323]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:30:34.383 --> 00:30:35.484]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:30:35.784 --> 00:30:37.065]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:30:37.265 --> 00:30:44.090]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:46.672]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:30:46.852 --> 00:30:49.776]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free 866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.796 --> 00:30:49.836]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.856 --> 00:30:50.798]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:31:01.946 --> 00:31:07.171]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[00:31:07.311 --> 00:31:15.419]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[00:31:15.659 --> 00:31:22.466]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[00:31:22.546 --> 00:31:23.807]  We're good to go!
[00:31:52.523 --> 00:31:53.746]  Call now and get free shipping!
[00:32:02.170 --> 00:32:07.514]  Developed to support respiratory health, Mucalixir is a new and unique product offered by Allergy Research Group.
[00:32:07.914 --> 00:32:14.820]  Mucalixir contains microdose DNA, a novel regulatory or signaling compound which appears to regulate mucus and cilia motion.
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:23.526]  Based on preclinical investigations and clinical trials, the small amount of DNA in Mucalixir may support healthy mucus levels via a regulatory mechanism.
[00:32:23.747 --> 00:32:29.351]  Dr. Albert Dahlberg, MD, PhD, states that microdose DNA does not cause any gene transfer.
[00:32:29.611 --> 00:32:32.595]  It is very safe and can be of considerable help to many people.
[00:32:32.935 --> 00:32:36.379]  Numerous doctors and patients have used Nucalixir with great results.
[00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:43.568]  There are dozens of scientific publications from university research on the use of the synthetic form of DNA for immune support and lung health.
[00:32:43.808 --> 00:32:48.714]  However, the DNA in Nucalixir is naturally occurring and is used only in microdose amounts.
[00:32:49.302 --> 00:32:51.963]  This novel approach has stunned both doctors and patients.
[00:32:52.283 --> 00:32:57.025]  Mucalixer can be found by visiting allergyresearchgroup.com or by calling 1-800-545-9960.
[00:32:57.225 --> 00:33:07.628]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.288 --> 00:33:10.689]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:11.369 --> 00:33:11.949]  Be heard!
[00:33:14.464 --> 00:33:22.387]  Hundreds of stories, drones, poison pens, Muslim children were infiltrating, gonna kill us any minute.
[00:33:22.867 --> 00:33:26.969]  But the borders stayed wide open and immigration from Muslim countries was at record levels.
[00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:32.311]  We asked the government, well, why then are you saying we're on the edge of total destruction?
[00:33:32.872 --> 00:33:36.253]  So that fraud's been exposed, but now they're saying that Iran has
[00:33:37.182 --> 00:33:44.748]  Nuclear weapons are going to be getting nuclear weapons, and that they've been testing and practicing hitting us with EMP bombs.
[00:33:45.228 --> 00:33:56.556]  And it actually says here that a third of the country will go back into the Stone Age, and that we'll all be cavemen running... I mean, this is just... It's unbelievable!
[00:33:56.596 --> 00:33:58.317]  They've got a zombie ray!
[00:33:58.337 --> 00:33:59.278]  I mean, I expect to hear that.
[00:33:59.538 --> 00:34:01.640]  It turns people into zombies!
[00:34:02.757 --> 00:34:03.617]  We'll get into that article.
[00:34:04.138 --> 00:34:06.879]  Also, CNN caught, as usual, with subliminal messages.
[00:34:07.699 --> 00:34:11.580]  Twice during Lord Cheney's speech yesterday, an X was flashed up on him.
[00:34:11.941 --> 00:34:21.184]  A black X and a white X. And they're talking about a staffer laughing when the X went up and that they think they planted it there in the control room.
[00:34:21.244 --> 00:34:25.166]  Folks, CNN, it came out even in the Washington Post.
[00:34:25.306 --> 00:34:26.826]  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black.
[00:34:28.467 --> 00:34:30.328]  It also came out in World Net Daily back in, what, 2000?
[00:34:31.858 --> 00:34:35.501]  Has hundreds of members of Army Intelligence working in it.
[00:34:36.321 --> 00:34:40.224]  Okay, they give you the fake liberal brand, they give you the fake conservative brand with Fox.
[00:34:41.465 --> 00:34:42.266]  This is staged.
[00:34:43.086 --> 00:34:47.890]  But, uh, we'll get into Dick Cheney flashing subliminals up on his face.
[00:34:48.690 --> 00:34:50.251]  What about Paul Watson on 9-11?
[00:34:50.291 --> 00:34:55.055]  He saw him with the UN flag up on the screen with a weird green snake that appeared and disappeared.
[00:34:55.355 --> 00:34:56.816]  I've seen that kind of stuff many times.
[00:34:57.416 --> 00:34:59.478]  That's just the overt stuff, the real subliminals.
[00:35:00.209 --> 00:35:06.052]  Are in that green and red and orange moving graphics in the back.
[00:35:06.573 --> 00:35:07.233]  How do I know that?
[00:35:07.353 --> 00:35:11.155]  Film students and college students all over the world, not just in the U.S.
[00:35:11.175 --> 00:35:14.997]  but in Europe, have frozen and paused car commercials, news.
[00:35:16.398 --> 00:35:21.341]  The most normal thing to find in there is clear print hailing Satan and asking Satan for power.
[00:35:22.161 --> 00:35:28.525]  Again, you may not believe in the devil or God, but regardless, our elite does and for some reason they're putting this on TV screens.
[00:35:29.753 --> 00:35:31.194]  And of course, if you're a Christian, you know why.
[00:35:31.234 --> 00:35:34.636]  You know why Pat Robertson's giving the El Diablo.
[00:35:36.638 --> 00:35:42.021]  Gold price is approaching its 18-year high of $500 an ounce.
[00:35:42.081 --> 00:35:42.782]  That's melt.
[00:35:46.164 --> 00:35:57.752]  Those articles I mentioned by Paul Craig Roberts, Bush is cooking up two more wars, and another one we must hold the scoundrels accountable, talking about how some Brits are about to go to jail for just leaking memos.
[00:35:58.727 --> 00:36:02.610]  Questioning the authenticity of pre-war data.
[00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.252]  Well, let's not go after those that fed us false data.
[00:36:06.812 --> 00:36:08.133]  Let's go after those that expose it.
[00:36:08.153 --> 00:36:09.053]  Let's go after the good guys.
[00:36:10.254 --> 00:36:14.737]  Al-Qaeda operative nabbed near the Mexican border, but the government wants to keep it quiet.
[00:36:15.858 --> 00:36:19.640]  And Bush, they're now reporting, wanted to bomb Al Jazeera during the war.
[00:36:21.443 --> 00:36:23.744]  Cheney, UPI reports, advocated torture.
[00:36:23.784 --> 00:36:25.244]  Well, we've seen him on TV, advocated.
[00:36:25.685 --> 00:36:31.527]  Meanwhile, Porter Goss, CIA director, is running around saying, oh no, we don't torture, it's called pressure.
[00:36:32.027 --> 00:36:34.948]  And see, that's what Alberto Gonzales said as they just changed the name.
[00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:40.392]  And bioterror attack is inevitable, they're saying, as well.
[00:36:40.432 --> 00:36:44.515]  And the Feds are ramping up spying on journalists and other Americans.
[00:36:44.555 --> 00:36:47.096]  Capitol Hill Blue is reporting on that.
[00:36:47.116 --> 00:36:49.698]  Meanwhile, the propaganda is intensifying with Iran.
[00:36:50.138 --> 00:36:55.361]  Exiled Iranian says nation hides materials for missiles.
[00:36:58.152 --> 00:36:59.693]  We just need to attack him immediately.
[00:36:59.713 --> 00:37:03.676]  And again, this is from the same crowd that are pathological liars.
[00:37:03.696 --> 00:37:06.498]  But right now, let's move quickly through your calls.
[00:37:06.879 --> 00:37:09.341]  Darren in California, welcome, you're on the air.
[00:37:10.201 --> 00:37:15.625]  Hey Alex, I was wondering if you could shed some light on the status of Luis Posada.
[00:37:16.346 --> 00:37:21.450]  He's the wanted international terrorist who, I guess he recently smuggled himself across the Mexican border.
[00:37:22.128 --> 00:37:23.670]  He's seeking asylum in the U.S.
[00:37:24.010 --> 00:37:30.999]  and he's the guy that's wanted for the 1976 bombing of a Cuban passenger airliner where he killed 73 people.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:32.221]  Name ring a bell?
[00:37:33.605 --> 00:37:35.746]  Yes, I'm familiar with him and the U.S.
[00:37:35.806 --> 00:37:45.849]  government has been trying to protect him and he has been found guilty in several foreign courts of carrying out that attack.
[00:37:45.889 --> 00:37:56.933]  But the interesting thing was that attack was blamed on Fidel Castro and it's now been confirmed that none of that happened and it was our government using this guy who is now seeking asylum.
[00:37:57.557 --> 00:38:02.539]  He's also a Bay of Pigs veteran, and he worked for Oliver North and Bush Sr.
[00:38:02.579 --> 00:38:04.140]  during the Iran-Contra scandal.
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.761]  Well, that's their specialty.
[00:38:05.781 --> 00:38:08.862]  Blowing up planes and blaming it on innocent people.
[00:38:09.423 --> 00:38:11.343]  I mean, that's what Operation Northwoods calls for.
[00:38:12.104 --> 00:38:19.647]  Yeah, well, I understand Homeland Security's only charging him with not immediately reporting to immigration, and I guess he's being held in El Paso, Texas.
[00:38:20.208 --> 00:38:25.230]  Here's a wanted international terrorist who, obviously, we just let slip through the crack.
[00:38:25.976 --> 00:38:28.717]  And these are supposed to be the guys we're going after.
[00:38:30.597 --> 00:38:33.578]  But again, he's been found guilty.
[00:38:33.598 --> 00:38:35.879]  Which Latin American country was it?
[00:38:35.919 --> 00:38:39.700]  I know he's wanted in Venezuela and Cuba.
[00:38:41.081 --> 00:38:43.161]  Yes, but it wasn't Venezuela.
[00:38:43.181 --> 00:38:44.042]  He was found guilty.
[00:38:44.062 --> 00:38:45.462]  And it wasn't Cuba.
[00:38:45.482 --> 00:38:46.942]  It was in another country.
[00:38:47.042 --> 00:38:48.583]  He's been convicted of that.
[00:38:49.295 --> 00:38:58.982]  And it was in the Miami Papers a few months ago because now it's been declassified that yes, he was an operative at that time, yes, he did carry out that operation.
[00:38:59.582 --> 00:39:09.749]  So, going from memory, a few months ago, it is now admitted that he blew up a plane full of men, women, and children, and then tried to blame it on Fidel Castro.
[00:39:10.009 --> 00:39:10.449]  That's right.
[00:39:10.970 --> 00:39:11.810]  Very friendly fellow.
[00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:12.491]  Thank you for the call.
[00:39:13.856 --> 00:39:15.137]  You know more about it than I do, sir.
[00:39:15.197 --> 00:39:17.738]  I was not aware that he's being held in El Paso, Texas.
[00:39:18.418 --> 00:39:22.740]  I suggest you go to PrisonPlanet.com where it says email the webmaster.
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:25.181]  You send that to Paul Watson there.
[00:39:25.201 --> 00:39:28.722]  I think it's PrisonPlanetWeb at Hotmail.com.
[00:39:28.762 --> 00:39:32.404]  For years I've been saying PrisonPlanet at Hotmail.com and no one corrected me.
[00:39:32.444 --> 00:39:33.724]  Please do when I make mistakes, folks.
[00:39:34.184 --> 00:39:37.986]  It's PrisonPlanetWeb at Hotmail.com.
[00:39:38.026 --> 00:39:39.286]  Send it over to Paul over there.
[00:39:39.306 --> 00:39:40.827]  I was not aware of that, sir.
[00:39:41.574 --> 00:39:45.658]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Jeff.
[00:39:45.698 --> 00:39:46.960]  Jeff, where are you calling us from?
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:48.521]  Yeah, I'm calling from Denver, Alex.
[00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:49.202]  Welcome, sir.
[00:39:49.522 --> 00:39:49.943]  Yeah, thanks.
[00:39:50.123 --> 00:40:02.656]  Yeah, you mentioned something earlier that I thought I would talk about, and that's basically some of the stuff that the Bush Crime Company does, and the reason nobody says anything about it is, let me give you a good example.
[00:40:04.386 --> 00:40:17.870]  Basically, back in 1991, the largest financial scandal in the world, the BNL, the BCCI cover-up, was a massive $5.5 billion bank fraud that the DOJ pinned on a lowly Atlanta bank manager.
[00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:26.432]  And they lent money to companies all over the world that were supplying Saddam Hussein with not weapons of mass destruction, but just weapons.
[00:40:27.412 --> 00:40:29.533]  And, of course, what happened was,
[00:40:30.086 --> 00:40:37.751]  The Atlanta scandal where billions of dollars were disguised as agricultural loans were used by Daddy Bush to supply these weapons.
[00:40:37.891 --> 00:40:39.332]  Yeah, what was it?
[00:40:39.352 --> 00:40:41.613]  $33 billion to Saddam Hussein alone?
[00:40:41.933 --> 00:40:42.994]  Yeah, it was a lot of money.
[00:40:43.074 --> 00:40:43.754]  It was a lot of money.
[00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:46.436]  But see, what it gets to, and of course the U.S.
[00:40:46.456 --> 00:40:50.939]  government agreed to act as a guarantor to these loans, and it was covered up.
[00:40:51.779 --> 00:40:53.901]  The director of the FBI, Robert Mueller III,
[00:40:55.086 --> 00:41:05.090]  was the department head at the DOJ at the time and basically he obstructed justice in a political racketeering cases of over 80 Washington D.C.
[00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.030]  lawyers, lobbyists, and politicians.
[00:41:07.491 --> 00:41:08.911]  And let me tell you how it worked, Alex.
[00:41:09.411 --> 00:41:24.237]  The scheme was to corruptly influence, the BCCI was to corruptly influence by bribes or transactions used as blackmail to members of Congress who were chosen to help promote these interests of the BCCI.
[00:41:24.921 --> 00:41:30.063]  In speeches in Chicago, these lecture fees, they were told they were getting as a bonus.
[00:41:30.784 --> 00:41:42.589]  And of course, what happened was, some of the congressmen, or directly, or through their trusted aides, picked up these bonuses in London, while they were secretly videotaped.
[00:41:43.289 --> 00:41:47.851]  Nevertheless, they had to pick up the payoff, in other words, the blackmail bribes.
[00:41:48.712 --> 00:41:50.953]  And that's how this scheme worked.
[00:41:50.993 --> 00:41:51.433]  And of course,
[00:41:52.028 --> 00:42:01.675]  You know, that's how they get people in Congress, the control files, if you will, on how they go about blackmailing Congressmen and Senators.
[00:42:01.815 --> 00:42:03.617]  No, I hear you, Jeff, and thanks for the call.
[00:42:03.657 --> 00:42:04.337]  Great points.
[00:42:04.798 --> 00:42:08.841]  In fact, I'm aware of that with BCCI.
[00:42:08.861 --> 00:42:17.127]  BCCI was caught red-handed involved not just in weapon sales or money laundering, but in drug money.
[00:42:18.155 --> 00:42:21.499]  And this is Bush Senior and Clark Clifford and all of them.
[00:42:21.539 --> 00:42:23.781]  I mean, it's like Mr. Anti-Corruption.
[00:42:25.623 --> 00:42:27.845]  What one politician can be trusted?
[00:42:27.925 --> 00:42:31.689]  What one man stands up against bribery and evil?
[00:42:32.070 --> 00:42:34.432]  What one man stands up against payoffs?
[00:42:34.512 --> 00:42:35.994]  Why, it's John McCain!
[00:42:36.713 --> 00:42:42.777]  And he's one of the dirtiest, most low-down, most red-handed creatures in Congress.
[00:42:43.077 --> 00:42:44.438]  So he's anti-corruption.
[00:42:44.498 --> 00:42:52.503]  It's like having Herman Goering be the chief judge in the Nuremberg trials over other Nazis.
[00:42:52.563 --> 00:42:54.645]  I mean, it's just totally ridiculous.
[00:42:54.705 --> 00:43:03.670]  But getting back to BCCI, it's more than just giving loans to people and then the U.S.
[00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.972]  taxpayer has to bail them out.
[00:43:07.555 --> 00:43:16.062]  These weapons loans are given to a host of third world countries, Iran, Iraq, I mean just hundreds.
[00:43:19.352 --> 00:43:23.555]  Those dictators are told, you're only allowed to buy the weapons through certain brokers.
[00:43:24.036 --> 00:43:25.897]  And that's the Carlisle Group and others.
[00:43:26.377 --> 00:43:28.259]  So then that money comes right back.
[00:43:28.299 --> 00:43:31.681]  You have to understand, they're not just giving them money for these weapons.
[00:43:32.302 --> 00:43:34.884]  They give them these loans, backed up by the U.S.
[00:43:34.904 --> 00:43:36.805]  taxpayer, or in many cases the U.S.
[00:43:36.825 --> 00:43:38.887]  government just gives them the money right out in the open.
[00:43:39.407 --> 00:43:40.888]  To quote, promote democracy.
[00:43:41.328 --> 00:43:45.912]  Actually to spread rebellion and death, because then they get to sell even more weapons as the conflicts widen.
[00:43:47.185 --> 00:43:47.845]  And that's the thing.
[00:43:47.905 --> 00:43:52.086]  The Bushes have always been high-level gophers for these financial interests.
[00:43:52.166 --> 00:44:04.429]  And anywhere you look, they're blowing out oil companies, they're blowing out banks, they're blowing out S&Ls, they're running scams, they're moving money out the back door, and when they're done with it, they literally burn it down.
[00:44:06.110 --> 00:44:10.951]  The entire family has rap sheets about four or five inches thick.
[00:44:11.031 --> 00:44:13.031]  I mean, just constant criminality.
[00:44:13.691 --> 00:44:15.752]  And you turn on the news, they're good little Christian boys.
[00:44:18.849 --> 00:44:27.775]  And look, I'm not up here saying everybody's got to be perfect in this world, but... I mean, the Bushes are a very sinister crew.
[00:44:28.636 --> 00:44:35.801]  But you ask the average American out there, though they are becoming a minority, they'll tell you, no, these are men of the Lord.
[00:44:36.696 --> 00:44:38.657]  These are devout Christians.
[00:44:39.057 --> 00:44:41.258]  Christ is actually in control of Bush.
[00:44:41.658 --> 00:44:42.659]  I hear that on the radio.
[00:44:42.699 --> 00:44:43.599]  People tell me that in person.
[00:44:43.619 --> 00:44:44.019]  No, no, no.
[00:44:44.399 --> 00:44:47.381]  He's actually... Bush is in control, guiding him.
[00:44:47.421 --> 00:44:49.742]  He is basically possessed by Jesus.
[00:44:51.783 --> 00:44:53.643]  That is the grand delusion.
[00:44:53.663 --> 00:44:56.185]  I mean, you wonder how Christians are going to accept Antichrist.
[00:44:56.405 --> 00:44:57.725]  There's your example right there.
[00:44:58.486 --> 00:45:03.768]  Bush, I'm convinced, could run around in red pajamas with little horns, with a plastic pitchfork,
[00:45:05.763 --> 00:45:10.828]  And by the way, I'm not being sarcastic about this, and some people would actually think that was Christian.
[00:45:13.411 --> 00:45:16.914]  He spent more money than all other presidents combined before him.
[00:45:18.255 --> 00:45:26.223]  He has viciously appointed anti-gun judges and anti-family judges and pro-abortion and open border promoting judges everywhere.
[00:45:27.569 --> 00:45:30.071]  The record is absolutely clear on that.
[00:45:30.291 --> 00:45:32.293]  And you tell a so-called conservative that?
[00:45:32.333 --> 00:45:33.334]  They're not real conservatives.
[00:45:33.794 --> 00:45:38.878]  As Paul Craig Roberts, Dr. Roberts said last week, these are just mindless idiots.
[00:45:39.559 --> 00:45:41.561]  Some of them, though, are afraid deep down.
[00:45:41.601 --> 00:45:45.884]  They've invested in this mindset and this whole false worldview.
[00:45:45.944 --> 00:45:46.645]  It feels good.
[00:45:46.685 --> 00:45:48.326]  They've chosen their team.
[00:45:48.426 --> 00:45:50.188]  They've jumped in on it.
[00:45:51.108 --> 00:45:52.910]  And it's too scary to their psyche.
[00:45:53.450 --> 00:45:55.192]  They may be intelligent, but they're cowards.
[00:45:56.943 --> 00:46:04.485]  And so they use that intelligence to build little pie-in-the-sky scenarios and to basically lie to themselves.
[00:46:05.065 --> 00:46:17.468]  And hey, C'est La Vie, if you like your dollar being devalued by 45 percent, if you like the incredible inflation we're living under, if you like all the things they've done to our economy or your children's future, then good, I hope you enjoy it.
[00:46:18.468 --> 00:46:23.149]  Patrick in... Where are you calling us from, Patrick, in Little Rock, Arkansas?
[00:46:23.870 --> 00:46:25.030]  No, Alex Fort Smith.
[00:46:25.789 --> 00:46:27.751]  Okay, I was told Little Rock and I have no idea why.
[00:46:27.771 --> 00:46:29.913]  I wonder who told the person answering the phone that?
[00:46:30.494 --> 00:46:31.455]  I don't know.
[00:46:31.895 --> 00:46:33.156]  I thank you for having me on your show.
[00:46:33.176 --> 00:46:34.878]  I've got a couple of things I'd like to tell you.
[00:46:34.938 --> 00:46:41.624]  One of them is an update on that double jeopardy deal that was the Baird case over in Oklahoma.
[00:46:41.644 --> 00:46:43.446]  The jury found him guilty in any way.
[00:46:44.116 --> 00:46:51.161]  The death penalty they gave him, but anyway, it was a nice little paw pot new law under the terrorist bill.
[00:46:51.181 --> 00:47:10.656]  Now that was a few weeks ago that it was brought up, a case up there of someone who shot at the police being found not guilty, and then they went ahead and charged him again, I believe for the third time, but this time federally, so we need to fill people back in on that conversation so they know what we're talking about.
[00:47:11.167 --> 00:47:18.669]  Yeah, and one of the deals they got him now was killing a police officer in the commission of a drug raid.
[00:47:18.689 --> 00:47:25.571]  So, I don't know, that's not a Paul Potts type of, you know, daily law that he created.
[00:47:26.351 --> 00:47:30.172]  But anyway, I don't know, I'm going to maybe talk to the mother or something.
[00:47:30.192 --> 00:47:33.193]  I'm sure I'll need to get a hold of the ACLU, even though I don't like devils.
[00:47:33.273 --> 00:47:35.994]  But another thing I wanted to tell you was Alex
[00:47:36.755 --> 00:47:42.099]  Did you read about where they were giving them kids in Japan that chicken flu vaccination and it killed 12 of them?
[00:47:42.900 --> 00:47:48.724]  Well a few weeks ago we reported on how it made kids go crazy and jump off bridges or commit suicide.
[00:47:49.204 --> 00:47:54.989]  Now there's been another 12 on top of the other cases they were talking about who've been dying.
[00:47:55.709 --> 00:48:04.296]  And by the way, major scientists, major firms are on record saying this Tamiflu doesn't even really work and may actually hurt you.
[00:48:05.406 --> 00:48:08.228]  And it may just keep you alive a few weeks and then you die.
[00:48:08.248 --> 00:48:10.009]  It may actually cause you to die.
[00:48:10.729 --> 00:48:18.974]  But look, the last five years, the government admits the flu shot they promoted and pushed didn't even cover the actual flu that was threatening us.
[00:48:19.454 --> 00:48:22.436]  But this year they told the people again, it doesn't cover this flu.
[00:48:22.476 --> 00:48:23.216]  It doesn't matter.
[00:48:23.256 --> 00:48:26.638]  People march out and roll their sleeves up and say, give me that mercury.
[00:48:27.859 --> 00:48:28.519]  I know.
[00:48:29.099 --> 00:48:31.060]  People are like sheep, I guess.
[00:48:31.301 --> 00:48:33.182]  There's one more thing I want to mention to you.
[00:48:34.335 --> 00:48:35.096]  Then I'll get off.
[00:48:35.937 --> 00:48:55.298]  Arkansas passed a law here that like deer season opening up and people that go out of state like Oklahoma, Texas or wherever and shoot a deer, they can't bring it into the state of Arkansas because they're afraid, you know, they're going to have that mad cow type disease in the deer and they don't want to get the deer in Arkansas with that stuff.
[00:48:56.508 --> 00:49:02.856]  Well, I mean, why would shooting a deer then cause it to spread once they brought it into your estate?
[00:49:02.877 --> 00:49:03.778]  That's just ridiculous.
[00:49:04.198 --> 00:49:04.759]  I know.
[00:49:05.079 --> 00:49:05.320]  I know.
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:06.141]  Well, thanks Alex.
[00:49:06.261 --> 00:49:06.962]  I appreciate it.
[00:49:06.982 --> 00:49:07.502]  God bless you.
[00:49:08.003 --> 00:49:08.384]  Thank you.
[00:49:08.424 --> 00:49:09.145]  Now, God bless you.
[00:49:11.035 --> 00:49:20.041]  Look, it's funny, they have all these quarantine laws inside the country, all these excuses to come on your property, all these excuses to investigate you.
[00:49:20.461 --> 00:49:36.972]  I was reading some Parks and Wildlife magazine yesterday, just opened it up and it was game wardens and forensics and how they pour molds for tire tracks and they get swabs out of the backs of cars and they pour molds for boots and they
[00:49:37.672 --> 00:49:39.273]  They stake people out.
[00:49:39.353 --> 00:49:48.177]  Why, to find out this guy was shooting wild hogs and some deer that were eating his garden and just throwing them out in the ditch.
[00:49:48.277 --> 00:49:55.400]  And why, after they did this big month-long investigation, all this manpower, why, they're charging the guy.
[00:49:57.341 --> 00:50:05.705]  Meanwhile, there's 800 dead and car bombs going off and machine gunning and death and dead cops and drug dealers taking over and, um, out of sight, out of mind.
[00:50:06.539 --> 00:50:26.958]  The border is completely wide open, but we've got... Folks, I've been sitting out before on the ranch, uh, you know, visiting family in East Texas on their ranch, and just out in the middle of nowhere, just with a campfire, everybody's sitting around the campfire, not even deer season, there's not even guns there, and the game wardens walk up, and, mind if I look around, look in your vehicles, you're not hunting, are ya?
[00:50:28.940 --> 00:50:31.302]  Just total waste of time, total waste of time.
[00:50:32.393 --> 00:50:36.095]  Meanwhile, right here in Austin, Texas, there are dead deer all over the highway.
[00:50:36.115 --> 00:50:37.495]  They're coming into every neighborhood.
[00:50:37.855 --> 00:50:38.836]  They're destroying everything.
[00:50:38.856 --> 00:50:40.276]  They're starving to death in mass.
[00:50:41.017 --> 00:50:42.537]  But they won't let you kill them or get rid of them.
[00:50:42.557 --> 00:50:50.220]  No, they pay some buffoons, what I see in the paper, $2,000 a piece, to load them up and ship them down to Mexico.
[00:50:51.441 --> 00:50:52.121]  To cage them.
[00:50:54.662 --> 00:50:58.904]  But they've got game wardens creeping around, making sure you don't kill the cockroaches.
[00:51:02.498 --> 00:51:09.880]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.

[00:51:40.371 --> 00:51:47.073]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:54:06.927 --> 00:54:08.809]  Alright, we're going to continue with your calls.
[00:54:09.229 --> 00:54:11.812]  Eddie in England is up next, then Kenny in Louisiana.
[00:54:12.232 --> 00:54:16.876]  Toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:18.297 --> 00:54:26.284]  Look, I'm not for poachers and I'm not for people just running around indiscriminately killing livestock.
[00:54:27.345 --> 00:54:32.630]  But what would you say if I told you that I've seen deer with, say, a broken leg and
[00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:37.732]  Disease with it's hair falling out and somebody needs to put it out of it's misery.
[00:54:38.593 --> 00:54:43.116]  What if I told you somebody had secretly taken a compound bow and shot them off their back porch?
[00:54:43.797 --> 00:54:46.158]  Why, that person needs to go to prison!
[00:54:47.259 --> 00:55:00.468]  You see, that's the mentality, and I read the article, why this individual, uh, he had even, he had even killed some of the precious wild hogs and he'd left them lay.
[00:55:01.423 --> 00:55:03.625]  These things are like cockroaches themselves.
[00:55:04.046 --> 00:55:05.047]  There are so many of them now.
[00:55:05.087 --> 00:55:07.029]  They're eating the baby fawns, the baby deer.
[00:55:07.910 --> 00:55:09.852]  They're just running around everywhere.
[00:55:10.733 --> 00:55:12.255]  They're getting more and more aggressive.
[00:55:12.415 --> 00:55:15.138]  They weigh 400, 500 pounds in some cases.
[00:55:15.678 --> 00:55:16.940]  They need to be killed!
[00:55:17.901 --> 00:55:18.301]  But nope!
[00:55:18.441 --> 00:55:22.786]  Game Warden, you shot four of these and you left them lay.
[00:55:23.735 --> 00:55:29.217]  On the side of the road and we're going to charge you with felonies and take your guns and your car.
[00:55:29.677 --> 00:55:32.198]  And that's what they're doing to this guy in this news article I read.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:40.602]  And I mean obviously folks, I wouldn't sit there and shoot a bunch of healthy deer for no reason.
[00:55:40.622 --> 00:55:46.544]  I'd take them to a processor and get them turned into food D. And get them turned into sausage and steaks.
[00:55:47.584 --> 00:55:48.505]  But those hogs
[00:55:49.864 --> 00:55:52.305]  I didn't know that if I shot a hog and let it lie.
[00:55:52.805 --> 00:56:00.727]  Big old wild thing with ticks and fleas all over it and long brown or black hair with giant tusks that stinks from 20 feet away.
[00:56:00.747 --> 00:56:03.308]  It'll bite your leg off if it gets a chance to.
[00:56:03.788 --> 00:56:12.191]  I didn't know that if I shoot one of those and leave it laying out in the field for the coyotes to eat, I didn't know I'd go to jail.
[00:56:12.231 --> 00:56:13.631]  That's an interesting thing to know.
[00:56:17.073 --> 00:56:18.253]  Vicious things as well.
[00:56:19.329 --> 00:56:21.770]  And all they are, are the progeny of wild pigs.
[00:56:22.411 --> 00:56:29.655]  You can take a wild sow, and a wild boar, wild male, and put them out in the field, and what do they have?
[00:56:29.715 --> 00:56:30.855]  Three litters a year?
[00:56:30.895 --> 00:56:32.876]  Sometimes as many as twelve piglets a piece?
[00:56:34.037 --> 00:56:36.258]  Normally it's about eight, but they can have as many as twelve.
[00:56:37.059 --> 00:56:42.281]  And four or five years, you're dealing with hundreds and hundreds of pigs from those two.
[00:56:44.483 --> 00:56:48.725]  Now I've kind of gotten off into a Derry Brownfield type subject here today, but
[00:56:50.766 --> 00:56:53.127]  It just shows where the mentality of the government is.
[00:56:54.087 --> 00:56:59.649]  By the way, these game wardens claim they have the right to come on your land now, without warrants, without probable cause, for no reason.
[00:56:59.669 --> 00:57:01.709]  Search your house, search your belongings.
[00:57:02.009 --> 00:57:04.030]  They can claim those powers all day long.
[00:57:04.250 --> 00:57:05.690]  You don't really have those powers.
[00:57:06.450 --> 00:57:09.191]  It's like the government claiming that black people weren't human beings.
[00:57:09.231 --> 00:57:10.732]  You may claim they're not human beings.
[00:57:11.212 --> 00:57:12.952]  You may claim they don't have rights, but they do.
[00:57:14.573 --> 00:57:19.114]  Now before I end this hour and the next minute and a half and come back with your calls and a ton of other news,
[00:57:20.257 --> 00:57:22.059]  Geopolitical, economic, you name it.
[00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:26.702]  I hope we'll take advantage of the Police State series, all three of my Police State films.
[00:57:27.063 --> 00:57:30.385]  Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:57:30.826 --> 00:57:31.746]  Normally $77.85, now $44.95, or a $32 savings.
[00:57:31.766 --> 00:57:34.369]  We have the DVD blowout special, normally $71.85, now only $45.95, that's over a $25
[00:57:47.458 --> 00:57:47.920]  Savings.
[00:57:48.381 --> 00:57:50.266]  We have a 9-11 book special, normally $31.85, now $19.95.
[00:57:50.366 --> 00:57:51.229]  You save, what, over $10?
[00:57:56.129 --> 00:58:00.973]  We have the amazing t-shirt deal, where instead of $20 a piece, they're $9.95 a piece right now.

[00:58:05.437 --> 00:58:11.201]  Get them, give them to people, give them as birthday presents.
[00:58:11.702 --> 00:58:13.183]  InfoWars.com.

[00:58:57.992 --> 00:58:58.653]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.293 --> 00:59:00.374]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.054 --> 00:59:02.235]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.836 --> 00:59:03.656]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.397 --> 00:59:05.297]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.958 --> 00:59:09.781]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.141 --> 00:59:14.224]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:23.127 --> 00:59:34.813]  Already into the second hour, prolific journalist and blogger extraordinaire Kirk Nemo joins us coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:59:34.913 --> 00:59:43.278]  We're going to be talking to Eddie in England, Michael in Little Rock, that's why I got confused with Patrick in Arkansas, and then Kenny in Louisiana, Jeff in New Mexico,
[00:59:44.552 --> 00:59:49.475]  George in Chicago and Jose in Miami, Florida.
[00:59:49.495 --> 00:59:52.357]  We'll get to all of you here in the next 30 minutes.
[00:59:57.310 --> 01:00:05.156]  Some of the things that are happening with the economy, this bizarre X showing up, the subliminal message that's now hitting mainstream news.
[01:00:05.696 --> 01:00:09.098]  Subliminals have always been there in modern history with the television folks.
[01:00:09.859 --> 01:00:10.600]  That's coming up.
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:15.223]  An incredible clip of Rumsfeld just engaging in more doublespeak.
[01:00:16.324 --> 01:00:24.209]  This is the same guy that got up on Face the Nation and said that they never said the war was about WMDs and he never said that there were WMDs.
[01:00:24.229 --> 01:00:25.090]  It was an urban legend.
[01:00:26.459 --> 01:00:30.302]  Of course, there's hundreds of clips of him saying it was about WMDs.
[01:00:30.802 --> 01:00:35.205]  We have a clip that rivals that coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:35.646 --> 01:00:45.673]  Right now, let's go to Eddie in England, and then I'm told we're going to have to skip over some of the other callers because Jeff in New Mexico disagrees, and we'll go to him coming up in the next segment.
[01:00:46.493 --> 01:00:53.619]  But Eddie's paying for this on his own dime, so he trumps our rule of somebody who disagrees going to the front of the line.
[01:00:54.179 --> 01:00:54.940]  Eddie, you're on the air.
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:55.500]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:57.199 --> 01:00:57.659]  Hello, Alex.
[01:00:58.159 --> 01:00:58.839]  Hi, welcome!
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:09.242]  Yeah, thank you very much for allowing me to be on the radio station, which I've tried to put all over Europe on the Internet.
[01:01:10.502 --> 01:01:23.485]  What frightens me at the moment is Ingrid's statement about Iran, which he's given to the Senate Homeland Committee.
[01:01:24.745 --> 01:01:25.445]  It looks as if
[01:01:27.423 --> 01:01:35.586]  The USA, which will mean Bush and Blair, are going to invade another country.
[01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:38.107]  Do me a favor, Eddie.
[01:01:38.207 --> 01:01:39.688]  Eddie, speak up for me.
[01:01:41.408 --> 01:01:42.509]  I'm awfully sorry.
[01:01:42.529 --> 01:01:46.130]  I heard what you said, it was just real low.
[01:01:46.150 --> 01:01:47.690]  You want me to go back over it again?
[01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:48.191]  No, no, no.
[01:01:48.211 --> 01:01:48.891]  I mean, you're right.
[01:01:50.687 --> 01:02:08.695]  We have Ginrich running around basically saying that they have a death ray, they're more dangerous than Martians, they may attack us any minute, and it's the same crowd that just constantly lies and makes up baloney, but now we should believe them because Iran's going to use an EMP on us and it's all over.
[01:02:10.375 --> 01:02:19.079]  Yeah, well, what seems to me that is happening at the moment is that when we had our
[01:02:20.531 --> 01:02:33.960]  George Bush's pimp Blair saying weapons of mass destruction could be launched on Britain within 45 minutes.
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:44.567]  It seems Gingrich now has put the weapons of mass destruction on merchant ships which can be launched against America
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:51.904]  And Britain at any time, so therefore we have got to go and invade Iran.
[01:02:52.284 --> 01:02:55.325]  Which if it was true... It's impossible, it's crazy!
[01:02:55.706 --> 01:02:59.968]  Exactly, but which if it was true would immediately escalate us to that point?
[01:03:01.681 --> 01:03:05.762]  I mean, if our government, run by these criminals, does attack Iran, I have a question.
[01:03:06.062 --> 01:03:07.603]  Do they have a right to defend themselves?
[01:03:07.663 --> 01:03:08.623]  And the answer is no.
[01:03:08.883 --> 01:03:11.004]  How dare them when we blow all their cities up?
[01:03:11.304 --> 01:03:12.784]  How dare them stand back up?
[01:03:12.804 --> 01:03:14.304]  Because they's evil!
[01:03:14.585 --> 01:03:26.148]  Well, our government took Mosaddegh out in 1953 by carrying out terror attacks and blaming it on him, declassified, admitted, and then caused the Shah to come in and then caused the Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:03:26.368 --> 01:03:27.508]  So it's our government's fault.
[01:03:27.588 --> 01:03:28.508]  I don't want to hear it anymore.
[01:03:28.728 --> 01:03:29.929]  And I totally agree with you, sir.
[01:03:29.989 --> 01:03:30.829]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[01:03:32.863 --> 01:03:35.644]  Well, you said it all.
[01:03:35.764 --> 01:03:36.584]  Thank you very much.
[01:03:54.767 --> 01:03:57.609]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.869 --> 01:03:59.450]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.790 --> 01:04:04.473]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.814 --> 01:04:11.558]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.878 --> 01:04:13.858]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:16.899]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.999 --> 01:04:21.660]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:26.261]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.

[01:04:55.447 --> 01:04:56.488]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.808 --> 01:04:59.590]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.871 --> 01:05:04.014]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.454 --> 01:05:05.275]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.595 --> 01:05:10.159]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.649 --> 01:05:12.770]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[01:05:55.422 --> 01:05:58.305]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[01:05:58.506 --> 01:06:03.893]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[01:06:04.133 --> 01:06:05.635]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:07.938]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:06:08.118 --> 01:06:11.683]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:06:11.983 --> 01:06:14.005]  And they can do it without due process.
[01:06:14.085 --> 01:06:21.013]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[01:06:21.193 --> 01:06:26.919]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[01:06:27.179 --> 01:06:34.667]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property, or make it look like you own no property, and a whole lot more.
[01:06:34.687 --> 01:06:35.387]  We're good to go.
[01:06:58.172 --> 01:06:58.813]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.473 --> 01:07:00.534]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.254 --> 01:07:02.355]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.035 --> 01:07:03.816]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.576 --> 01:07:05.637]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.157 --> 01:07:09.820]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:14.442]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:22.668]  I was just talking to a caller from England who's just horrified by Newt Gingrich.
[01:07:23.588 --> 01:07:27.472]  Running around, going to the Congress and intelligence meetings.
[01:07:28.012 --> 01:07:35.058]  His evidence is, I'm Newt Gingrich, the college professor, the pumpkin head who destroyed the conservative revolution of 94.
[01:07:35.159 --> 01:07:37.140]  I'm the Bilderberg Group CFR member.
[01:07:37.961 --> 01:07:39.943]  I'm the guy calling for torture in police state.
[01:07:39.963 --> 01:07:40.783]  I'm a little twit.
[01:07:42.105 --> 01:07:45.107]  He had all those fake fights with Bill Clinton and all that.
[01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:46.208]  That was just a ruse.
[01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:50.312]  Again, Rupert Murdoch every week has lavish four-hour dinners.
[01:07:51.098 --> 01:07:51.958]  With Hillary Clinton.
[01:07:52.019 --> 01:07:53.499]  It's all staged.
[01:07:53.559 --> 01:07:55.660]  The Bushes and the Clintons have been in business.
[01:07:55.901 --> 01:07:58.242]  Clinton's been CIA since 1968.
[01:07:59.923 --> 01:08:00.643]  Bush Sr.
[01:08:00.903 --> 01:08:04.105]  has been CIA since the late 1950s.
[01:08:06.246 --> 01:08:07.827]  Just like it's now admitted.
[01:08:07.927 --> 01:08:09.387]  Mainstream news over in England.
[01:08:09.748 --> 01:08:10.608]  Tony Blair.
[01:08:11.148 --> 01:08:13.029]  British intelligence all along.
[01:08:13.069 --> 01:08:14.510]  Back in college with the M.O.
[01:08:14.570 --> 01:08:15.491]  of the peace activists.
[01:08:15.851 --> 01:08:17.291]  The zit-faced guitarist.
[01:08:18.552 --> 01:08:20.053]  It makes me sick.
[01:08:20.822 --> 01:08:25.123]  And they pull these little ruses, these little chicken fights, and then get you to pick a side.
[01:08:26.344 --> 01:08:27.244]  And they laugh at you.
[01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:33.125]  But, uh, he's saying, Gingrich sees Iran threat to U.S.
[01:08:33.165 --> 01:08:34.426]  like Nazi Germany.
[01:08:35.026 --> 01:08:40.788]  Ex-Speaker, latest official, raise alarm on the threat of nuclear EMP attack by Tehran.
[01:08:41.728 --> 01:08:48.570]  The threat posed to the national security of the United States by Iran was likened only to one posed by Nazi Germany in the 1930s.
[01:08:51.269 --> 01:09:03.796]  Former Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, said, who suggested Tehran could be planning a preemptive nuclear electromagnetic pulse attack on America that would turn a third or more of the country back to the 19th century level of development.
[01:09:03.917 --> 01:09:04.817]  Ah, death ray.
[01:09:06.098 --> 01:09:17.985]  Meanwhile, just a few months ago, the Chief General in the top three, they don't have a number one, they just have three top guys, said, we will destroy 200 cities if you get involved or touch any of our holdings globally.
[01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:19.553]  We are ready to kill you.
[01:09:20.153 --> 01:09:23.174]  And the answer of our media was to grovel and lick boots.
[01:09:23.854 --> 01:09:32.477]  But you've got a little pathetic backwards country with no weapons, ten years away from nuclear weapons, no delivery systems, and they've got a death ray.
[01:09:32.497 --> 01:09:33.237]  They're about to kill us.
[01:09:33.637 --> 01:09:43.540]  Gingrich made the stunning statement, which echoes warnings of other congressional leaders and national security experts, in testimony before a subcommittee of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last week.
[01:09:44.060 --> 01:09:51.165]  He said, the extraordinary challenge that the current regime in Iran poses to the safety of the United States requires extraordinary measures to meet it.
[01:09:51.746 --> 01:10:00.572]  Not since the failure of the League of Nations in the 1930s to confront the aggression of the dictatorships in Japan, Italy, and Germany, we have seen a willful avoidance of reality.
[01:10:00.592 --> 01:10:05.035]  I thought it was you that avoids reality, which is now underway with regard to Iran's agenda.
[01:10:05.315 --> 01:10:09.899]  There are lessons to be learned from the 1930s, and those lessons apply directly to the current government in Iran.
[01:10:11.753 --> 01:10:22.941]  And see, they're all going to toot their horns and say, see, we told you so when those mushroom clouds go off, when that bioweapons get released, there'll be a red-faced Gingrich on TV going, we've got to have the new world order now, nuke them!
[01:10:23.281 --> 01:10:27.024]  The President, I have watched strategic nuclear attacks against our enemies.
[01:10:27.464 --> 01:10:28.986]  The age of America is here.
[01:10:29.066 --> 01:10:34.409]  We will defend the Republic by creating the first world empire!
[01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:37.512]  I announce myself to be the Emperor!
[01:10:38.973 --> 01:10:40.594]  I mean, literally, this is what they're setting up.
[01:10:42.142 --> 01:10:45.304]  I've actually heard Savage, Mr. Weiner, go, you just wait until the next attack.
[01:10:45.564 --> 01:10:47.966]  We're going to arrest all of you and put you in slave camps.
[01:10:48.406 --> 01:10:50.327]  All of you are taken over.
[01:10:50.727 --> 01:10:52.429]  Ah, the dirty beatnik of the 60's.
[01:10:52.729 --> 01:10:54.130]  Let's just know it was a real plan.
[01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:57.692]  Just like Ron Paul exposed them all as the former Trotskyites.
[01:10:57.732 --> 01:11:00.254]  They wanted to take over then, and they're taking over now.
[01:11:00.794 --> 01:11:02.255]  So you think they're all in trouble right now.
[01:11:02.295 --> 01:11:03.516]  You think they've been beaten back.
[01:11:03.556 --> 01:11:04.776]  You think we're having big victories.
[01:11:05.077 --> 01:11:06.337]  Everybody can go to sleep now.
[01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:09.499]  Why are they indicted Scooter Libby?
[01:11:09.719 --> 01:11:10.260]  Who cares?
[01:11:12.506 --> 01:11:13.088]  Who cares?
[01:11:16.657 --> 01:11:19.505]  I mean, that's as phony as Libby's phony name.
[01:11:20.648 --> 01:11:21.450]  And I'm just tired of it!
[01:11:22.330 --> 01:11:24.532]  And we've got another one of these neocons beating the drum.
[01:11:24.772 --> 01:11:25.973]  It's all over talk radio today.
[01:11:26.294 --> 01:11:29.136]  Gee, what are they going to do with that EMP bomb they're about to drop?
[01:11:29.336 --> 01:11:30.658]  Listen, listen, listen.
[01:11:30.958 --> 01:11:32.459]  Liberals can just shut up.
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.402]  They got an EMP bomb.
[01:11:35.802 --> 01:11:37.344]  I like that Gingrich.
[01:11:37.744 --> 01:11:39.025]  He don't lie to me.
[01:11:39.766 --> 01:11:43.509]  We gots to do something about that secret weapon they got over there.
[01:11:44.550 --> 01:11:48.093]  Again, our government tested EMPs in the upper and lower atmosphere.
[01:11:48.153 --> 01:11:48.674]  Hundreds of them.
[01:11:50.376 --> 01:11:51.417]  Over 20 in one night!
[01:11:52.037 --> 01:11:53.798]  And it doesn't do what they say it does.
[01:11:54.598 --> 01:11:55.879]  Doesn't do what they say it does.
[01:11:56.279 --> 01:11:58.360]  And Iran doesn't even have an atomic bomb.
[01:11:59.581 --> 01:12:02.923]  They have satellites, they have helicopters that will look through hundreds of feet.
[01:12:03.403 --> 01:12:03.743]  Okay?
[01:12:05.144 --> 01:12:10.827]  Where there literally will be a trail, even if it's shielded from where it's been brought, where it's been moved.
[01:12:11.187 --> 01:12:12.868]  They have devices that see everything.
[01:12:14.249 --> 01:12:14.769]  Admittedly!
[01:12:16.983 --> 01:12:17.744]  It's ridiculous.
[01:12:17.764 --> 01:12:28.852]  The IAEA... See, either you accept total UN occupation, thousands of IAEA inspectors going anywhere they want, whenever they want, and the IAEA inspectors themselves say, we've never been given this much access.
[01:12:30.974 --> 01:12:31.714]  Anywhere they want to go.
[01:12:33.556 --> 01:12:35.277]  No weapons, no development, none of it.
[01:12:38.259 --> 01:12:39.180]  I say that's wrong.
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:42.823]  See, the lesser of two evils, the lesser of two weevils as they say,
[01:12:44.660 --> 01:12:52.102]  Is over here on the left, we got the UN saying, we're the good cop, we'll come in and take you over if you don't totally let us run your country, you have no sovereignty.
[01:12:52.582 --> 01:12:56.703]  And on the other side of that, America plays a part of the bad cop, we're going to attack you no matter what you do.
[01:12:58.123 --> 01:13:08.486]  So Iran's like, okay, get your cameras, get your people out, we're not doing detente anymore, and we've looked at the lesson of North Korea, who got a
[01:13:09.992 --> 01:13:11.073]  They've got dozens of weapons.
[01:13:11.093 --> 01:13:12.514]  We're hearing they've got six weapons.
[01:13:12.815 --> 01:13:14.816]  They had dozens of hydrogen bombs years ago.
[01:13:16.758 --> 01:13:26.927]  That giant stalag, that giant prison, with a little psychopathic dwarf in the seven-story Pleasure Palace, literally kidnapping South Korean starlets and raping them to death.
[01:13:27.188 --> 01:13:28.989]  Then he apologizes to Time Magazine.
[01:13:29.229 --> 01:13:31.111]  I'm sorry about all the women I've kidnapped and killed.
[01:13:31.311 --> 01:13:35.255]  I mean, a literal Jeffrey Dahmer down there running things.
[01:13:36.062 --> 01:13:39.003]  And their boss is up in Beijing, and what's our answer?
[01:13:39.283 --> 01:13:41.444]  Here, have the factories to build cruise missiles.
[01:13:41.904 --> 01:13:45.525]  Oh, Israel, here, give them the plans to your new jet fighter that we gave you.
[01:13:45.825 --> 01:13:46.285]  Oh, yes.
[01:13:46.705 --> 01:13:49.226]  Oh, here, have all the new helicopter designs.
[01:13:49.266 --> 01:13:52.007]  Here, buy aircraft carriers from the EU.
[01:13:52.287 --> 01:13:53.588]  Here, buy helicopter ships.
[01:13:53.768 --> 01:13:59.890]  Oh, here, buy our... Then Taiwan asks for 1960s-era old destroyers.
[01:14:00.670 --> 01:14:01.550]  China threatens us.
[01:14:01.890 --> 01:14:03.971]  We go, no, we're not going to give them to you, sorry.
[01:14:05.726 --> 01:14:08.607]  But these guys will swagger around in their military uniforms.
[01:14:09.187 --> 01:14:10.408]  I'm an analyst.
[01:14:11.168 --> 01:14:13.209]  I'm a threat assessor.
[01:14:13.329 --> 01:14:15.150]  I'm an intelligence officer.
[01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:18.471]  Why, Bush is really defending America.
[01:14:18.851 --> 01:14:20.032]  Iran's the threat.
[01:14:20.712 --> 01:14:21.812]  Iran's a pushover.
[01:14:22.192 --> 01:14:26.134]  And if Iran is run by these devilish extremists, which they aren't,
[01:14:27.501 --> 01:14:33.743]  Then it's our government's fault because they took Mozadek out and put in the individuals that caused this chain of events.
[01:14:33.763 --> 01:14:36.084]  Do you understand how Iran got where it is?
[01:14:36.104 --> 01:14:40.386]  Our government publicly went in and carried out bombings.
[01:14:41.586 --> 01:14:42.467]  Blew up mosques.
[01:14:42.647 --> 01:14:43.327]  Shot people.
[01:14:44.187 --> 01:14:44.728]  They hired 2,000 thugs.
[01:14:47.293 --> 01:14:53.020]  And for a month, burned that place down, handing out handbills saying, up with Mosaddegh, up with Communism.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:57.725]  When Mosaddegh, again, kicked the Communists out, was Man of the Year in Time Magazine two years before.
[01:14:59.026 --> 01:14:59.967]  Wore a suit and tie.
[01:15:01.249 --> 01:15:01.709]  Secular.
[01:15:03.511 --> 01:15:04.112]  Pro-West.
[01:15:04.890 --> 01:15:08.874]  And all he said was, I'm going to keep 20% of our oil money for the Iranian people.
[01:15:08.914 --> 01:15:12.377]  You don't get all the oil in the country for free, as BP has been getting.
[01:15:12.617 --> 01:15:14.799]  And BP came right over here and said, you take him out.
[01:15:14.819 --> 01:15:19.383]  And we said, when you say Jump Master Queenie, we say how high.
[01:15:19.483 --> 01:15:21.144]  And I heard that creature.
[01:15:21.585 --> 01:15:23.687]  Now, I know I talk about this every month or so because it's important.
[01:15:24.227 --> 01:15:28.591]  I heard Kermit Roosevelt on NPR from a recording he did in the mid-80s.
[01:15:29.676 --> 01:15:38.587]  Brag that he went in there with nine other CIA officers and some British intel officers and a couple million bucks and they brought that whole country down.
[01:15:38.808 --> 01:15:41.151]  Just bragging about how they blew up mosques and shot people.
[01:15:43.624 --> 01:15:45.465]  I mean, even the encyclopedia tells you that.
[01:15:45.525 --> 01:15:48.748]  Even State Department websites talk about it.
[01:15:48.788 --> 01:15:49.708]  And they're proud of it.
[01:15:49.949 --> 01:15:59.255]  I'm not going to be here in 50 years, folks, reading in some online journal about how our government carried out 9-11 and what a big stroke it was and how cool it was.
[01:15:59.576 --> 01:16:01.657]  I want to bring these people to justice now!
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:06.521]  They attack our own ships.
[01:16:06.561 --> 01:16:07.862]  They attack our own bases.
[01:16:07.902 --> 01:16:08.982]  They stage attacks.
[01:16:09.263 --> 01:16:10.904]  They've been caught over and over again.
[01:16:13.206 --> 01:16:14.086]  Let me just say this again.
[01:16:15.507 --> 01:16:21.550]  In Project Shad, in some of the last operations carried out in the mid-1980s, this is the latest stuff declassified.
[01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:23.011]  Now nothing is declassified anymore.
[01:16:23.591 --> 01:16:28.233]  Bush just stopped all of the basic declassifications, like 98%.
[01:16:28.293 --> 01:16:31.255]  Even presidential records now, frozen forever.
[01:16:31.275 --> 01:16:32.755]  You're not even going to get the Kennedy stuff in 2024.
[01:16:36.494 --> 01:16:44.196]  But the last step to be classified from 1985, from Project Shad, is in England and in the U.S., they take a young officer in, low-level officer.
[01:16:44.537 --> 01:16:45.777]  Do you want to get some time off?
[01:16:45.797 --> 01:16:46.617]  Do you want a week off?
[01:16:46.657 --> 01:16:46.997]  An R&R?
[01:16:47.017 --> 01:16:48.438]  Want to go back and see your wife and kids?
[01:16:48.898 --> 01:16:51.799]  Sign here and agree to let us test a flu virus on you.
[01:16:52.119 --> 01:16:56.400]  You'll probably get sick from it, but it's for the country, and you'll get a week off after you're done being sick.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:57.541]  After your illness.
[01:16:58.081 --> 01:16:59.741]  This is BBC AP, folks.
[01:17:00.722 --> 01:17:02.222]  Okay, sure, I'll do it for my country.
[01:17:02.842 --> 01:17:05.403]  Put the young man in, lock the chamber, nerve gas and kill him.
[01:17:06.201 --> 01:17:09.222]  Dissect his body, tell his wife he just died of the common cold.
[01:17:09.842 --> 01:17:10.802]  And here's the sign for him.
[01:17:11.362 --> 01:17:19.744]  He's a hero, he died testing the flu, and he's dead now, and meanwhile she finds out, you know, years later, that they actually dissected him.
[01:17:19.764 --> 01:17:25.545]  And cold-bloodedly imagine, just closing the door, we're going to kill him, having the doctors just flip the switch and kill him!
[01:17:27.606 --> 01:17:32.567]  Oh, we'll hem and haw all day about gas chamber and some murdering rapist.
[01:17:33.889 --> 01:17:37.011]  But, ah, you know, so we kill our own people.
[01:17:37.171 --> 01:17:42.194]  Ah, so they killed some daddies and mommies going to work in 1968 on the New York subway.
[01:17:42.794 --> 01:17:43.955]  Declassified public.
[01:17:45.376 --> 01:17:49.098]  Ah, so we radiated thousands of American children and 110,000 Jewish children.
[01:17:49.538 --> 01:17:50.198]  Our government did.
[01:17:51.859 --> 01:17:53.060]  Israeli government did it for the money.
[01:17:54.409 --> 01:17:55.610]  Yes, I'm going to trust them.
[01:17:55.630 --> 01:17:56.010]  You know what?
[01:17:56.251 --> 01:17:57.612]  They say we want to go into Iran.
[01:17:57.632 --> 01:18:00.614]  They say they got some magic bomb and they're going to use it on us.
[01:18:00.634 --> 01:18:02.676]  It's the same people that lie to us all the time.
[01:18:02.756 --> 01:18:03.216]  I don't care.
[01:18:03.236 --> 01:18:03.597]  You know what?
[01:18:03.997 --> 01:18:05.158]  I'm going to believe them.
[01:18:06.079 --> 01:18:06.539]  You know what?
[01:18:06.659 --> 01:18:08.120]  I'm going to go along with them.
[01:18:08.741 --> 01:18:09.201]  You know what?
[01:18:09.281 --> 01:18:11.803]  I'm going to believe them and I'm just going to be stupid.
[01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.705]  And I'm just going to trust my government.
[01:18:14.278 --> 01:18:22.520]  And so what if Bush openly wants the assault weapons ban and is supporting Governor Pataki who's trying to sue gun manufacturers and if he wins it will shut down every manufacturer we got?
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:24.661]  And so what if all this is happening?
[01:18:24.701 --> 01:18:26.641]  And so what if he wants amnesty and open borders?
[01:18:26.661 --> 01:18:30.182]  And so what if he wants a free trade area of the Americas that'll make NAFTA look like a joke?
[01:18:30.863 --> 01:18:31.883]  And his economic impact?
[01:18:31.923 --> 01:18:34.784]  And so what if he wants a trans-Texas corridor up into Canada?
[01:18:34.984 --> 01:18:37.985]  And so what if he wants to take all my freedoms and habeas corpus?
[01:18:38.025 --> 01:18:39.445]  And so what if he's for torture?
[01:18:40.337 --> 01:18:42.481]  So what if his daddy's a drug dealing murderer?
[01:18:43.001 --> 01:18:44.824]  Who's daddy supported the Nazis?
[01:18:45.345 --> 01:18:45.866]  You know what?
[01:18:45.906 --> 01:18:48.229]  I'm gonna... I just like Bush.
[01:18:48.329 --> 01:18:49.211]  I just like him.
[01:18:49.571 --> 01:18:52.215]  He just wears a cowboy hat and that just tickles me.
[01:18:54.375 --> 01:19:01.262]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:19:01.402 --> 01:19:14.334]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobeys, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:19:14.514 --> 01:19:16.296]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:19:16.476 --> 01:19:19.939]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:19:20.219 --> 01:19:24.002]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:19:24.263 --> 01:19:29.227]  Whatever it is you seek, Dangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:19:29.487 --> 01:19:31.208]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:19:31.469 --> 01:19:35.432]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:19:35.692 --> 01:19:37.554]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[01:19:54.136 --> 01:19:55.777]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:19:56.097 --> 01:20:01.839]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:20:02.099 --> 01:20:07.221]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:20:07.561 --> 01:20:16.845]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:20:17.205 --> 01:20:22.167]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:20:22.468 --> 01:20:26.490]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:20:26.690 --> 01:20:31.432]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:20:31.812 --> 01:20:37.715]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:20:38.075 --> 01:20:44.283]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:20:44.343 --> 01:20:45.305]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:45.325 --> 01:20:46.286]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:55.225 --> 01:20:57.466]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.886 --> 01:21:02.249]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:02.509 --> 01:21:08.332]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:08.552 --> 01:21:12.614]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:12.895 --> 01:21:18.097]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[01:21:18.458 --> 01:21:19.798]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:27.263]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:27.303 --> 01:21:29.684]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:30.025 --> 01:21:32.326]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:32.706 --> 01:21:36.329]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:43.013]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:43.453 --> 01:21:44.454]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:44.774 --> 01:21:45.114]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:45.154 --> 01:21:45.395]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:55.225 --> 01:21:56.845]  Government of death which governs me.
[01:21:57.386 --> 01:21:58.686]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:59.126 --> 01:22:01.807]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:02.287 --> 01:22:04.927]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:05.367 --> 01:22:11.829]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:22:12.149 --> 01:22:19.551]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at LibertyStickers.com.
[01:22:20.231 --> 01:22:23.734]  LibertyStickers.com can even customize your own bumper stickers.
[01:22:23.915 --> 01:22:25.956]  It's time to stand up for what you believe.
[01:22:26.317 --> 01:22:27.338]  Invest in your freedom.
[01:22:27.558 --> 01:22:32.082]  Get your stickers at LibertyStickers.com for your family, friends, and community.
[01:22:32.682 --> 01:22:34.124]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:22:34.304 --> 01:22:34.644]  Have you?
[01:22:35.225 --> 01:22:36.726]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:22:37.186 --> 01:22:39.108]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[01:22:39.128 --> 01:22:43.152]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:22:43.292 --> 01:22:44.093]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:22:47.006 --> 01:22:48.166]  Oh, some have been forgotten.
[01:22:48.606 --> 01:22:52.348]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[01:22:56.389 --> 01:23:02.410]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:23:03.010 --> 01:23:06.031]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:08.932 --> 01:23:11.453]  Now, Jeff in New Mexico says he disagrees with me.
[01:23:12.053 --> 01:23:14.134]  And he's gonna go to the front of the line coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:14.714 --> 01:23:15.614]  Don't worry, we'll get to him.
[01:23:16.767 --> 01:23:20.449]  Jose and George and Michael, everybody else is patiently holding.
[01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:28.233]  But here over the next three minutes or so, I am honored to be joined by Debbie Morrow of New Millennium Concepts.
[01:23:28.273 --> 01:23:37.718]  Look, the holidays are here, and instead of giving someone a mindless gift they'll never use or never appreciate, get them a sports bottle that does 630 refills of tap water
[01:23:40.199 --> 01:23:50.347]  Reducing massively chemicals and pesticides and cutting out entirely bacteria so it's safe to drink and massively reduces problems.
[01:23:50.387 --> 01:23:52.449]  You can get 5 of them for $100.
[01:23:52.929 --> 01:23:59.875]  Knock off brands of these that don't cut out half as much are like $35 at the camping supply store.
[01:24:00.335 --> 01:24:03.878]  I use this in my everyday life and you'll save the money in just a few weeks
[01:24:04.338 --> 01:24:04.558]  I think?
[01:24:20.465 --> 01:24:32.893]  Because they have these big filters they use at the plants and sometimes they break or have problems and all that poison that was taken out of the water breaks through and rushes into the bottled water you happen to get and they don't catch it.
[01:24:33.213 --> 01:24:41.159]  The point is tap water is bad news, bottled water is bad news, even though I still occasionally drink it, some of the local brands I trust, if I don't have my sports bottle with me.
[01:24:41.519 --> 01:24:44.601]  Sports bottles I think are the best stocking stuffers out there, period.
[01:24:45.786 --> 01:24:58.637]  Then they also have the 199 Berkey light system that does, I don't know, 10,000 gallons, cuts out everything to non-detectable levels, meaning an electron microscope can't find it, sits in the corner of your kitchen, small, easy, portable.
[01:24:59.037 --> 01:25:03.861]  They've got a bunch of other specials and deals right now, and you're crazy if you don't take advantage of this.
[01:25:03.921 --> 01:25:05.382]  I mean, I really believe in this.
[01:25:06.243 --> 01:25:10.006]  I was buying from New Millennium Concepts years before they were sponsors.
[01:25:10.346 --> 01:25:11.567]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:25:11.987 --> 01:25:12.768]  Alex, hi!
[01:25:12.808 --> 01:25:15.110]  Thanks for having me, and I have a new special.
[01:25:15.774 --> 01:25:16.154]  Oh great!
[01:25:16.334 --> 01:25:22.677]  And this is a very first time ever news special and Tim just told it to me and I was like, oh yay!
[01:25:22.697 --> 01:25:23.938]  I'll announce it on Alex.
[01:25:25.218 --> 01:25:30.981]  Okay, you know how it's been five of the generic label Berkey's four bottles for $99?
[01:25:31.821 --> 01:25:38.384]  But we've never done like five of the real label four bottles that would make a really good gift because it's got
[01:25:39.008 --> 01:25:42.329]  You know, the label on it, it tells all the things it takes out.
[01:25:42.389 --> 01:25:43.130]  It's real nice.
[01:25:43.410 --> 01:25:45.030]  Let's face it, people like those.
[01:25:45.110 --> 01:25:54.034]  I personally buy the generic ones, but the bottles with the Berkey printing on it and describing what it takes out do look a lot more fancy.
[01:25:54.114 --> 01:25:59.176]  Right, and it also tells you, it's got a little place, you know, that tells you how many refills and all that.
[01:25:59.236 --> 01:26:02.037]  Exactly, the person you're giving it to will then appreciate what it does.
[01:26:02.137 --> 01:26:07.039]  Right, and they're normally $39 each, and Jim said we could do five for $135.
[01:26:08.695 --> 01:26:09.816]  You know, maybe I'm psychic.
[01:26:09.836 --> 01:26:12.698]  You didn't mention to me that you were going to be plugging sports bottles.
[01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:14.680]  You've never exclusively plugged those.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.881]  You come out of the gates plugging them.
[01:26:16.101 --> 01:26:18.183]  I couldn't believe it when you said that.
[01:26:18.463 --> 01:26:21.186]  But I don't believe you're psychic because I don't believe in that.
[01:26:21.246 --> 01:26:23.488]  I was joking, Debbie.
[01:26:24.648 --> 01:26:28.752]  I'm like Jimmy Carson, the great carnac with the envelope to the head.
[01:26:28.992 --> 01:26:29.533]  No, seriously.
[01:26:29.773 --> 01:26:30.874]  Tell us that special again.
[01:26:31.034 --> 01:26:35.418]  It's five of the regular labeled Berkey sport bottles for $135.
[01:26:38.618 --> 01:26:39.599]  Well, that's a great deal.
[01:26:39.699 --> 01:26:41.159]  It is a really good deal.
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:43.501]  I mean, it's amazing.
[01:26:43.561 --> 01:26:45.902]  I was like, oh my gosh, okay.
[01:26:46.923 --> 01:26:53.226]  I was really excited because I think that that even makes it an even better thing because it does have the writing on it.
[01:26:54.027 --> 01:26:55.607]  It's the same filter either way.
[01:26:56.288 --> 01:26:58.789]  Exactly, but it's $99 to get five without it.
[01:26:59.290 --> 01:27:01.131]  Right, five of the generic labeled for $99.
[01:27:02.347 --> 01:27:04.168]  Or five of the regular labels for 135.
[01:27:04.208 --> 01:27:13.033]  And then somebody could go online to Berkeywater.com or InfoWars.com and just print off the description of the sports models and give that with the generic.
[01:27:13.373 --> 01:27:13.673]  Right.
[01:27:14.254 --> 01:27:16.355]  And we do put the literature in there.
[01:27:16.375 --> 01:27:21.918]  I had a couple of people call me and say they didn't get literature in the last group that went out.
[01:27:22.558 --> 01:27:23.879]  And I apologize for that.
[01:27:23.939 --> 01:27:25.099]  Apparently they had run out.
[01:27:25.500 --> 01:27:27.741]  But normally we do put literature in there.
[01:27:28.613 --> 01:27:31.675]  Well, you can always just go online and do it.
[01:27:31.696 --> 01:27:32.636]  Let me give people the number.
[01:27:32.696 --> 01:27:38.161]  Folks, pay attention to this, and believe me, 70% of the toxins you're getting in your body are through the water.
[01:27:38.501 --> 01:27:40.082]  Your body is over 70% water.
[01:27:40.923 --> 01:27:42.404]  Here is the toll-free number, 1-888-FREE.
[01:27:44.946 --> 01:27:45.106]  803-4438.
[01:27:46.066 --> 01:27:49.448]  That's triple eight.
[01:27:49.468 --> 01:27:49.488]  803-4438.
[01:27:50.268 --> 01:27:59.552]  Or just go to murkywater.com and tell them in the little comment section what free gifts you want with those different orders.
[01:27:59.572 --> 01:28:04.455]  They'll describe the different free gifts and tell them it's an Alex Jones special to take advantage of that.
[01:28:04.475 --> 01:28:08.817]  The best specials, the best deals you're going to find, folks, are the Alex Jones specials.
[01:28:09.277 --> 01:28:11.418]  Often imitated, never duplicated.
[01:28:11.818 --> 01:28:21.225]  And there's a lot of other people out there that sell Berkeys, but you're getting it directly from the source, the folks that make them, 888-803-4438.
[01:28:21.525 --> 01:28:22.545]  Debbie, thanks for coming on.
[01:28:22.565 --> 01:28:23.766]  Thank you.
[01:28:24.227 --> 01:28:25.648]  And you have a great Thanksgiving.
[01:28:27.008 --> 01:28:30.331]  But you know, Debbie will be back with us tomorrow, so I can tell her, have a good Thanksgiving then.
[01:28:30.531 --> 01:28:36.295]  Give her a call, 888-803-4438, or berkeywater.com, or order via InfoWars.com.

[01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:47.091]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.

[01:30:17.418 --> 01:30:36.625]  The Berkey Security Pack is important every day and a must during emergencies because it provides purified water, long-term low-energy lighting, backup battery power for your Berkey LEDs, free long-term solar power for communications devices such as radios, walkie-talkies, and cell phones, as well as power for small applications.
[01:30:36.825 --> 01:30:40.447]  Get the one-stop solution for your emergency and everyday needs.
[01:30:40.607 --> 01:30:43.288]  The Berkey Security Pack, a retail value of $518 for only $399.
[01:30:46.109 --> 01:30:50.331]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:50.451 --> 01:30:52.292]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:30:54.033 --> 01:30:56.854]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[01:30:56.954 --> 01:31:02.016]  We all eat sugar, saturated fats, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[01:31:02.256 --> 01:31:08.419]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[01:31:08.699 --> 01:31:14.282]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[01:31:14.582 --> 01:31:20.106]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[01:31:20.346 --> 01:31:24.188]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[01:31:24.208 --> 01:31:29.472]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[01:31:29.672 --> 01:31:29.872]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:29.892 --> 01:31:30.852]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[01:31:36.476 --> 01:31:40.659]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[01:31:40.879 --> 01:31:43.801]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[01:31:43.981 --> 01:31:48.844]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[01:31:49.124 --> 01:31:51.505]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[01:31:54.728 --> 01:31:57.469]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.489 --> 01:32:01.332]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.671 --> 01:32:08.916]  Kurt Nemo is coming up in about five minutes, the prolific journalist and blogger.
[01:32:09.436 --> 01:32:14.081]  I like Kurt because there's a lot of people out there that get a lot of it right, but get a lot of it wrong.
[01:32:14.161 --> 01:32:15.382]  And Kurt is just continual.
[01:32:15.402 --> 01:32:16.263]  He's right on target.
[01:32:16.624 --> 01:32:25.113]  And he's also breaking the false left-right paradigm that's meant to keep us in our two respective camps, two arms on the same Cyclopsian system.
[01:32:25.902 --> 01:32:29.983]  And coming up, I'm going to play this Rumsfeld clip on this week with Stephan Avalos.
[01:32:30.464 --> 01:32:32.364]  I mean, Rumsfeld is just a real piece of work.
[01:32:32.384 --> 01:32:48.910]  Wait until you hear this clip where he says he didn't advocate the invasion, but then double spins it and then adds another twist of double think and Orwellian Newspeak to it with a cherry on top of just incredible aplomb.
[01:32:50.436 --> 01:32:52.097]  Try to follow what I just said.
[01:32:52.157 --> 01:32:52.757]  I know I couldn't.
[01:32:53.157 --> 01:33:00.560]  When I start thinking about Rumsfeld, I start babbling and saying strange things and things that don't make sense because that's what he does.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:03.401]  It's good because we knew it was because I didn't know what I was doing.
[01:33:03.501 --> 01:33:06.542]  Overall, because they didn't know, it doesn't matter I don't know what I know.
[01:33:06.622 --> 01:33:09.403]  I do know that I know that I know that I know what I don't know.
[01:33:10.504 --> 01:33:11.604]  That's Donald Rumsfeld.
[01:33:11.644 --> 01:33:12.665]  We have some of those clips.
[01:33:12.705 --> 01:33:16.006]  Maybe you can dig those out of the cart.
[01:33:17.040 --> 01:33:17.981]  I know there's some in my cards.
[01:33:18.001 --> 01:33:19.682]  There might be some over in Jack Blood's card too.
[01:33:19.702 --> 01:33:21.824]  I hear him play those on a routine basis.
[01:33:22.384 --> 01:33:26.848]  Perhaps we should have a double entendre and add some of these onto the end of Rumsfeld.
[01:33:28.309 --> 01:33:33.213]  But I'm told that this caller disagrees, so he goes to the front of the line here.
[01:33:33.953 --> 01:33:35.355]  Jeff in New Mexico!
[01:33:35.455 --> 01:33:35.935]  Jeff!
[01:33:36.616 --> 01:33:37.316]  You're on with us!
[01:33:37.416 --> 01:33:38.097]  You disagree?
[01:33:39.738 --> 01:33:43.401]  You told the person answering the phones with my view on torture or something?
[01:33:44.252 --> 01:34:04.638]  Yeah, as it relates to the Terry Schiavo case, you know, to me, keeping people like Terry Schiavo alive, or Jack Kevorkian's patients, or those who took advantage of the Oregon assisted suicide legality, keeping those kind of people alive is torture.
[01:34:06.199 --> 01:34:09.020]  And you were against Terry Schiavo
[01:34:10.632 --> 01:34:15.995]  Being starved like that, which I think assisted suicide would have been better for her case.
[01:34:17.376 --> 01:34:22.199]  She said she wanted that in case she... Let me ask you a question, sir.
[01:34:23.099 --> 01:34:25.621]  Do you like the National Socialists?
[01:34:25.641 --> 01:34:26.421]  Do you like the Nazis?
[01:34:28.863 --> 01:34:30.363]  What's that have to do with this?
[01:34:30.424 --> 01:34:31.604]  No, it has to do with it.
[01:34:31.644 --> 01:34:32.545]  Come on, answer the question.
[01:34:32.765 --> 01:34:37.988]  I bet, my bottom dollar, you kind of think those uniforms are sexy.
[01:34:38.604 --> 01:34:46.050]  No, because they make you have a short haircut and I've got a beard and long hair and I don't believe in somebody telling me how I should look like that.
[01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:51.434]  I understand, but do you like the Nazis?
[01:34:52.035 --> 01:34:55.737]  I'd have to think about that.
[01:34:56.278 --> 01:34:58.039]  You said something about Google too.
[01:34:58.079 --> 01:35:01.682]  You're flipping in your recommendation of Google.
[01:35:02.323 --> 01:35:07.567]  Because before you were saying to boycott America online
[01:35:08.635 --> 01:35:11.517]  Something to do with their against the Second Amendment?
[01:35:11.858 --> 01:35:12.138]  Yes.
[01:35:12.498 --> 01:35:15.861]  But America Online had connections with Google.
[01:35:15.881 --> 01:35:22.547]  Well, they all have connections, sir, and I've said Google's got too much power, and we should frequent other search engines as well.
[01:35:23.067 --> 01:35:23.688]  Thanks for your call.
[01:35:23.708 --> 01:35:25.229]  That's nice changing the subject.
[01:35:25.710 --> 01:35:28.212]  No, I just said that because the Nazis were for eugenics.
[01:35:28.292 --> 01:35:32.956]  Look, I don't have a... I didn't bring up Terry Schiavo in months.
[01:35:32.976 --> 01:35:34.357]  I don't know what this is, but that's fine.
[01:35:36.975 --> 01:35:39.637]  If you say you disagree, and you really disagree, you go to the front of the line.
[01:35:40.457 --> 01:35:41.738]  But this is very frustrating.
[01:35:42.539 --> 01:35:46.281]  I believe that if you're dying of, say, bone marrow cancer, it's excruciatingly painful.
[01:35:46.301 --> 01:35:50.004]  They should give you any amount of painkiller you need to not be in pain.
[01:35:50.344 --> 01:35:55.087]  And if that causes you to drift off and die, and it's inoperable, then that isn't assisted suicide.
[01:35:55.107 --> 01:35:56.168]  That's giving you pain relief.
[01:35:58.326 --> 01:36:02.150]  Okay, but you were defending Jack Kevorkian.
[01:36:02.810 --> 01:36:04.912]  You don't know anything about Jack Kevorkian, do you?
[01:36:05.212 --> 01:36:06.513]  He is a pervert, sir.
[01:36:06.974 --> 01:36:08.115]  He's in prison right now.
[01:36:08.495 --> 01:36:15.842]  Jack Kevorkian lost his medical license twice because they would catch him in the morgue with dead bodies doing something that Jeffrey Dahmer likes.
[01:36:16.222 --> 01:36:17.643]  I'm not going to say much more than that.
[01:36:19.325 --> 01:36:20.386]  It's called necrophilia, sir.
[01:36:21.787 --> 01:36:28.771]  And I'll never forget seeing him on PBS with all these big Hollywood stars, including Tom Cruise there and all these supermodels.
[01:36:29.071 --> 01:36:34.093]  And these women were going, ooh, ooh, ooh, getting, I mean, literally, up against Jack Kevorkian.
[01:36:34.133 --> 01:36:34.534]  I love it.
[01:36:34.554 --> 01:36:37.415]  And there were these demons, paintings of demons.
[01:36:37.435 --> 01:36:39.436]  And he's going, I painted these in tissues.
[01:36:39.976 --> 01:36:41.497]  I painted this with my own blood.
[01:36:41.537 --> 01:36:43.838]  I removed it with an ampoule.
[01:36:44.379 --> 01:36:45.699]  And I'll never forget watching this.
[01:36:45.879 --> 01:36:47.320]  And the guy had green skin.
[01:36:48.281 --> 01:36:49.121]  Total psychopath.
[01:36:49.904 --> 01:36:51.286]  He loves to kill people, folks.
[01:36:51.326 --> 01:36:52.047]  He loves death.
[01:36:52.868 --> 01:36:54.570]  And guess what the demons were doing?
[01:36:54.650 --> 01:36:56.333]  I can't say everything the demons were doing.
[01:36:56.353 --> 01:36:57.514]  They had it on PBS.
[01:36:57.835 --> 01:36:59.417]  I couldn't say I don't want to say it.
[01:36:59.437 --> 01:37:01.660]  Eating a baby coming out of a woman's womb.
[01:37:02.432 --> 01:37:05.374]  This symbolizes the right for abortion.
[01:37:05.634 --> 01:37:07.855]  And it's some, I mean, really demonic, folks.
[01:37:08.195 --> 01:37:12.337]  I mean, my image, long before I saw this painting of a demon, was the image I was seeing.
[01:37:12.377 --> 01:37:14.378]  It was captivatingly evil.
[01:37:14.619 --> 01:37:15.939]  It was what you'd call art.
[01:37:16.019 --> 01:37:17.220]  Oh, yes, it's art, folks.
[01:37:17.280 --> 01:37:18.040]  It got my attention.
[01:37:18.381 --> 01:37:27.065]  This green, gray-skinned demon lapping blood and gobbling a baby coming out of a womb.
[01:37:27.085 --> 01:37:31.828]  And this is on at 8 o'clock at night on PBS television about what a great man he is.
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:36.081]  Did you know that the reason he went to prison?
[01:37:37.081 --> 01:37:44.343]  They confirmed that almost every person he killed, excuse me, every person he killed, was not terminal.
[01:37:44.623 --> 01:37:52.645]  Most of them were mentally ill death freaks, and he'd take them into that van, he'd put a hood over them, and then he would just get really excited with that dead body.
[01:37:55.066 --> 01:37:56.246]  And I'm sick of that freak.
[01:37:56.926 --> 01:38:00.367]  And the government wants to set the precedent to get rid of us, sir.
[01:38:00.427 --> 01:38:02.388]  The plan is to force you to die.
[01:38:02.972 --> 01:38:05.233]  What do you think the cancer viruses in the vaccines are?
[01:38:05.253 --> 01:38:07.173]  What do you think the dioxin in the food's for?
[01:38:07.593 --> 01:38:08.674]  They openly want to get rid of you.
[01:38:08.714 --> 01:38:09.714]  It's like Logan's Run.
[01:38:09.734 --> 01:38:11.715]  When you're done, they want you out of the way.
[01:38:11.775 --> 01:38:13.515]  They want you in the third world, in Africa.
[01:38:14.135 --> 01:38:17.857]  Nobel Prize winners go in public about the stuff they're putting in the vaccines to kill people.
[01:38:18.017 --> 01:38:19.937]  What do you think genetically modified food does?
[01:38:20.477 --> 01:38:21.478]  I apologize to Kurt Neumel.
[01:38:21.498 --> 01:38:23.478]  He's down on the line with us, and I'm ranting and raving.
[01:38:24.078 --> 01:38:32.141]  It's just that... I knew... I knew that when I brought up the Nazis, you wouldn't... you wouldn't...
[01:38:33.556 --> 01:38:34.177]  Disown them.
[01:38:35.978 --> 01:38:48.169]  I knew it, because everybody I run into who's a quasi-conservative, who then claims that they're for eugenics, agrees with more than they disagree with the Nazis.
[01:38:51.012 --> 01:38:53.534]  And that's what Margaret Sanger, that's what all that scum is for.
[01:38:53.554 --> 01:38:54.014]  And you know what?
[01:38:54.074 --> 01:38:54.735]  I'm tired of it.
[01:38:54.795 --> 01:39:00.300]  I'm not here to be managed, and to be a human resource, and to be fed on, and to be controlled, and to be a slave.
[01:39:03.084 --> 01:39:12.149]  I don't like President Bush's initiative to forcibly, psychologically test and then drug every child in America, with the drug companies in their own memos saying, we'll go from 10% on drugs to over 50!
[01:39:12.609 --> 01:39:13.230]  Ha ha ha!
[01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:15.411]  We'll make hundreds of millions a year off this!
[01:39:15.811 --> 01:39:16.552]  This is sick!
[01:39:18.813 --> 01:39:21.154]  So it isn't a right to die, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:39:22.955 --> 01:39:29.459]  I mean, yes, if I'm dying an excruciating death of cancer, and I'm in total pain, I want them to hit me with morphine.
[01:39:32.395 --> 01:39:41.978]  And I want as much of it as it takes to knock the pain out, but I don't want the doctors, and I don't want it codified that the doctors are going to be there and the doctors are going to kill me.
[01:39:41.998 --> 01:39:43.039]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:39:43.599 --> 01:39:52.642]  I'm going to go to you, I know you're holding Michael in Little Rock, Arkansas, and I really want to talk to George in Chicago, and Jose in Miami, I really want to talk to Jose and others.
[01:39:52.902 --> 01:39:58.144]  We're going to get to you, but I don't want to be rude to our guest who I really want to talk to as well, and that's Kurt Nemo.
[01:39:59.156 --> 01:40:01.537]  Well, it's not much different than what the Nazis did.
[01:40:25.717 --> 01:40:29.119]  You know, if they feel that somebody's not useful in society, they get rid of them.
[01:40:29.579 --> 01:40:35.142]  Jack, you know, I'm from Michigan, and I know a lot about Jack Kevorkian, and you're absolutely spot-on about him.
[01:40:35.483 --> 01:40:36.523]  He's a pervert.
[01:40:37.023 --> 01:40:40.045]  I remember seeing his paintings and just going, oh my God.
[01:40:40.065 --> 01:40:49.310]  You know, at first, the way the media spun him, that he was the savior for people that were terminally ill, but then once you scratch below the surface and took a look at him, the guy is a sicko.
[01:40:50.931 --> 01:40:52.232]  I mean, he really is a sicko.
[01:40:53.745 --> 01:40:55.621]  He lost his medical license for a reason.
[01:40:57.620 --> 01:41:00.841]  The nurses would open the door up and there'd be the cockroach with the dead body.
[01:41:00.941 --> 01:41:02.642]  So it's just so sick.
[01:41:03.282 --> 01:41:04.503]  But that's not why we have you on today.
[01:41:04.523 --> 01:41:06.103]  I don't want to get diverted off into all that.
[01:41:06.724 --> 01:41:08.584]  Kurt Nemo, tell us why you got involved.
[01:41:08.604 --> 01:41:24.731]  I mean, you've already worked in the media for quite a long time, but why did you get involved in the alternative media and kind of explode onto the scene in the last few years with KurtNemo.com and your great daily blog that is, what, Another Day in the Empire?
[01:41:24.751 --> 01:41:25.571]  That's right.
[01:41:26.291 --> 01:41:31.696]  Well, basically I'm just a concerned citizen who has a, you know, I can write and read.
[01:41:31.736 --> 01:41:32.517]  I'm pretty good at it.
[01:41:33.137 --> 01:41:39.443]  And I just, you know, after Bush got elected, I started looking at things and, you know, I had to speak out.
[01:41:39.483 --> 01:41:42.025]  And that's precisely what I've done for the last four years on the blog.
[01:41:43.806 --> 01:41:46.489]  There's so much happening right now, Kurt.
[01:41:47.472 --> 01:41:48.533]  I mean, where do you start?
[01:41:48.553 --> 01:41:49.134]  You know what I want to do?
[01:41:49.154 --> 01:41:52.798]  I want to play this clip first of Rumsfeld.
[01:41:53.379 --> 01:41:55.401]  And this is on This Week with Stephanopoulos.
[01:41:55.722 --> 01:41:59.566]  And then it cuts to people commenting after he left, after the interview on it.
[01:42:00.267 --> 01:42:02.129]  And just listen to the incredible spin.
[01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:05.894]  He even gets mad at the king of softballs, the twit Stephanopoulos.
[01:42:06.551 --> 01:42:14.154]  And then he clearly tries to say it wasn't his policy, he wasn't asked about it, he didn't advocate the invasion.
[01:42:14.534 --> 01:42:20.816]  As if the President's about to go to war, he wouldn't ask the opinion of the Secretary of Defense.
[01:42:20.896 --> 01:42:21.516]  Pure bull.
[01:42:21.856 --> 01:42:25.938]  Then he tries to, once he realizes he stuck his foot in his mouth, he tries to spin it.
[01:42:26.827 --> 01:42:29.188]  And, uh, it's just thoroughly disgusting.
[01:42:29.208 --> 01:42:30.309]  Let's go ahead and roll that clip.
[01:42:30.789 --> 01:42:39.174]  Is it, is it correct to suggest that, uh, General Vines or General Casey or General Evesey have ever asked for more troops and been turned down?
[01:42:39.214 --> 01:42:40.595]  That is flat not true.
[01:42:41.075 --> 01:42:48.099]  You know, what has been happening as we debate the number of troops, as we debate whether to withdraw, is also this continual debate over the intelligence.
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:55.004]  I know you said you believe it is wrong to question the motives or the honesty of administration officials.
[01:42:55.024 --> 01:42:56.344]  But I have a different question for you.
[01:42:56.825 --> 01:43:02.929]  If you had known that no weapons of mass destruction would be found, would you have advocated invasion?
[01:43:03.706 --> 01:43:05.007]  I didn't advocate invasion.
[01:43:05.027 --> 01:43:05.427]  You didn't?
[01:43:05.888 --> 01:43:08.230]  No, I wasn't asked if you read all the books and things.
[01:43:08.350 --> 01:43:08.590]  You weren't?
[01:43:08.610 --> 01:43:09.531]  But why won't you ask?
[01:43:09.591 --> 01:43:10.452]  That's very puzzling.
[01:43:10.472 --> 01:43:17.637]  Well, I'm sure the President understood what my views were, but as a technical matter, did he ever look and say, what should we do?
[01:43:17.838 --> 01:43:19.599]  Should we go do this or not do that?
[01:43:19.619 --> 01:43:22.461]  This is something that the President thought through very carefully.
[01:43:22.481 --> 01:43:24.203]  Are you trying to distance yourself from the war with that?
[01:43:24.243 --> 01:43:24.743]  Of course not.
[01:43:24.763 --> 01:43:25.023]  Of course not.
[01:43:25.043 --> 01:43:26.845]  I agreed completely with the decision to go to war.
[01:43:27.569 --> 01:43:30.990]  And I've said that a hundred times, and don't even suggest that.
[01:43:31.190 --> 01:43:31.790]  I'm just asking.
[01:43:31.930 --> 01:43:32.850]  Yeah, well you know better.
[01:43:34.130 --> 01:43:39.031]  Look, the interesting thing to me about the pre-war intelligence is clearly it was wrong.
[01:43:40.031 --> 01:43:47.973]  It was wrong, but everyone saw the same thing in the executive branch, in the legislative branch, in the other countries that was presented at the UN.
[01:43:47.993 --> 01:43:51.093]  But would you have been for an invasion if we had known that?
[01:43:52.834 --> 01:43:53.654]  The answer is
[01:43:55.299 --> 01:43:56.040]  Probably, yes.
[01:43:56.480 --> 01:43:57.961]  There have been two realities here.
[01:43:58.241 --> 01:44:05.545]  There's been the rhetorical reality of the Bush administration, which is, you know, the imperial strategy that George was talking about.
[01:44:05.906 --> 01:44:08.887]  But the military reality has been entirely different.
[01:44:09.468 --> 01:44:13.811]  This war has been an orphan since the day after we arrived in Baghdad.
[01:44:14.191 --> 01:44:19.154]  It hasn't been fought by the civilian leadership of the Pentagon.
[01:44:20.395 --> 01:44:22.698]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:44:23.178 --> 01:44:30.586]  Now, number one, and I'm sure Kurt Nimmo has a comment on this, they fired the Secretary of the Army, even though he was a fellow Enron scammer.
[01:44:30.606 --> 01:44:39.556]  I mean, he's the guy who actually led legislatures through fake computer systems, through fake rooms, quote, trading energy shares.
[01:44:40.137 --> 01:44:40.838]  It was all fake.
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:43.782]  I mean, this is one of their little crook buddies, folks.
[01:44:43.802 --> 01:44:46.383]  We're talking Legion of Doom, you know, types.
[01:44:46.864 --> 01:44:49.666]  And he just said, well, I need 450,000 troops or we're going to fail.
[01:44:49.686 --> 01:44:50.526]  And they said, fired!
[01:44:50.886 --> 01:44:52.708]  They fired dozens and dozens.
[01:44:52.728 --> 01:44:53.368]  Just, you're gone.
[01:44:53.408 --> 01:44:53.848]  You're gone.
[01:44:53.888 --> 01:44:54.289]  You're gone.
[01:44:54.329 --> 01:44:54.729]  You're gone.
[01:44:55.009 --> 01:44:55.610]  You're relieved.
[01:44:55.650 --> 01:44:56.310]  You're relieved.
[01:44:56.570 --> 01:44:57.711]  Because they said they needed troops.
[01:44:58.111 --> 01:45:00.093]  And then Rumsfeld sits there and lists these generals.
[01:45:00.173 --> 01:45:04.816]  Oh, they never told me they needed more troops and were refused when everybody knows that's a lie.
[01:45:05.036 --> 01:45:10.019]  This is the same guy that got up on Face the Nation and said, I never said Saddam had WMDs.
[01:45:10.219 --> 01:45:11.060]  It's an urban legend.
[01:45:11.600 --> 01:45:15.622]  And then he tries to spin it into the President never asking him his opinion.
[01:45:16.162 --> 01:45:19.644]  Kurt Nemo, do people like being lied to by this monkey?
[01:45:19.964 --> 01:45:21.385]  I'm not sure they realize.
[01:45:21.465 --> 01:45:27.787]  I think that the best majority of the American population has a memory of about 15 minutes.
[01:45:27.947 --> 01:45:30.789]  This is not the first time he's been caught doing this.
[01:45:30.969 --> 01:45:35.671]  He did it on a PBS McNeil-Lair report.
[01:45:36.283 --> 01:45:42.406]  Last year, you know, he's constantly doing this, and I think that he thinks he can get away with it because most people aren't paying attention.
[01:45:43.827 --> 01:45:48.449]  But what about the people that know he's lying, but still just go, well, they've got to lie to us.
[01:45:48.489 --> 01:45:50.931]  They've just got to do this to keep America safe.
[01:45:51.371 --> 01:45:55.233]  Well, I mean, they've changed their song and dance the whole time along.
[01:45:55.293 --> 01:45:59.155]  I mean, remember when they first went there, it was weapons of mass destruction, weapons of mass destruction.
[01:45:59.505 --> 01:46:02.906]  And then it was, you know, we're bringing democracy to the Iraqi people.
[01:46:02.986 --> 01:46:05.727]  So, you know, they saw, they did that spin.
[01:46:05.767 --> 01:46:07.688]  They saw that nobody really cared a whole lot.
[01:46:07.708 --> 01:46:14.871]  I mean, some people did, but, you know, with the corporate media in place, you know, you know, the echo chamber for the Bush administration, it doesn't matter.
[01:46:14.931 --> 01:46:16.811]  I mean, people just don't pay attention.
[01:46:17.211 --> 01:46:18.392]  I don't think they really care.
[01:46:20.686 --> 01:46:30.416]  Well, they better care, because the economy is being looted by these individuals, and the real elite is just using Bush as kind of the front man and the set piece for this whole agenda to go through.
[01:46:30.436 --> 01:46:35.140]  I think most Americans are tired of the whole Iraq situation.
[01:46:35.180 --> 01:46:41.066]  You look at the polls, they say, you know, yeah, we, you know, it was wrong, we went there, you know.
[01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:44.511]  And they just turn around and close their minds on the whole thing.
[01:46:44.531 --> 01:46:45.591]  They don't look at the lies.
[01:46:45.712 --> 01:47:03.967]  And now that moves us forward to all these different known neocon writers and people who are known to be on the payroll of the government to put out this info, saying that basically that the Iranians have some type of death ray run by Marvin the Martian, and they're going to EMP us any moment, run through the hills.
[01:47:04.247 --> 01:47:08.931]  Meanwhile, China's openly threatening to nuke us, and Bush says, that's no problem, let's give them more of our industry.
[01:47:09.111 --> 01:47:10.332]  I mean, it just doesn't hold water.
[01:47:10.652 --> 01:47:11.572]  Well, it doesn't hold water.
[01:47:11.612 --> 01:47:19.794]  I mean, you know, first thought, my first thought was when hearing that, upon reading that, was how are they, okay, let's assume they do have an EMP device.
[01:47:20.154 --> 01:47:21.915]  How are they going to get in the upper atmosphere?
[01:47:21.955 --> 01:47:28.057]  They don't have any delivery vehicles to put it in our upper, you know, it has to be put above the United States and set off.
[01:47:28.637 --> 01:47:30.897]  And as you said earlier, it doesn't work anyway.
[01:47:31.257 --> 01:47:37.499]  So once again, they're depending on the ignorance of the American people to, you know, you know, this Freddy Krueger boogeyman of
[01:47:38.089 --> 01:47:43.593]  You know, of Iran and, you know, the evil mullahs are, you know, it's just all nonsense.
[01:47:43.613 --> 01:47:58.304]  And I don't think that they really consider the fact that most people, you know, well, I should say that they don't consider the fact that most people don't realize or they do realize that most people don't realize that this stuff doesn't work and it's not going to work.
[01:47:59.228 --> 01:48:01.950]  But they tested EMPs back in the 60s.
[01:48:02.050 --> 01:48:05.912]  They did high-altitude detonations of high-powered hydrogen bombs.
[01:48:06.552 --> 01:48:10.015]  And it doesn't do what Hollywood has always hyped it to do.
[01:48:10.075 --> 01:48:14.757]  I mean, maybe in the Matrix, it knocks out the evil robots.
[01:48:14.877 --> 01:48:18.680]  But in the real world, EMP doesn't do what they say it does.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:22.282]  And then we look at the other fact that Iran is saying that they want to be peaceful.
[01:48:23.382 --> 01:48:28.685]  And compared to North Korea and China and others, and Russia, they're no threat at all.
[01:48:29.285 --> 01:48:31.867]  They're just on the PNAC boys' hit list.
[01:48:31.907 --> 01:48:32.367]  That's right.
[01:48:32.407 --> 01:48:33.387]  That's absolutely it.
[01:48:33.407 --> 01:48:34.948]  They're on the PNAC boys' hit list.
[01:48:35.468 --> 01:48:37.890]  One of the next two targets, Syria and Iran, is next.
[01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:42.992]  And, you know, the neocons want to take these guys out, so they're going to come up with any excuse they can.
[01:48:43.012 --> 01:48:46.234]  They're going to put this boogeyman, you know, out there.
[01:48:46.414 --> 01:48:48.595]  It's the same thing with these so-called dirty bombs.
[01:48:49.228 --> 01:49:02.042]  You look at the experts on this and they say, look, more people would die in traffic jams trying to get away from radiological devices, an explosion of a radiological device, than would actually die from the radiation.
[01:49:03.095 --> 01:49:03.915]  Well, that's right.
[01:49:04.115 --> 01:49:06.316]  And meanwhile, the D.U.
[01:49:06.476 --> 01:49:16.020]  used in proving grounds in Iraq and Syria and in Afghanistan is the equivalent of 40,000 medium-sized hydrogen bombs.
[01:49:16.821 --> 01:49:18.501]  And they don't care about that.
[01:49:18.521 --> 01:49:20.082]  They'll use that all over the world.
[01:49:20.282 --> 01:49:33.328]  We're all being exposed to it, but meanwhile, if somebody, they'll have a national alert because an x-ray part got stolen, ooh, somebody might blow it up and somebody might breathe some low-level radiation, ooh, we're all dead, let's give our rights up!
[01:49:33.668 --> 01:49:34.428]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:35.689 --> 01:49:42.492]  Well, let's talk about torture, let's get into Kurt Nimmo's crystal ball and what you think is coming up in the future.
[01:49:42.512 --> 01:49:46.614]  Do you think Bush will go down or will this all just continue on basically forever?
[01:49:47.598 --> 01:49:49.759]  Uh, who do you see winning the 08 election?
[01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:52.081]  And we'll take your calls, folks, so stay with us.
[01:49:52.101 --> 01:49:53.461]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:49:53.902 --> 01:49:55.422]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.603 --> 01:49:58.684]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.824 --> 01:50:02.726]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.766 --> 01:50:07.009]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.349 --> 01:50:11.111]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.251 --> 01:50:12.992]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.252 --> 01:50:16.535]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.595 --> 01:50:21.319]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:24.522]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.702 --> 01:50:27.585]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.045 --> 01:50:34.171]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.691 --> 01:50:38.496]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:38.897 --> 01:50:40.259]  Order your video today.

[01:50:53.215 --> 01:50:56.238]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:50:56.538 --> 01:51:01.482]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.723 --> 01:51:06.086]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.387 --> 01:51:15.295]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.495 --> 01:51:19.118]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.398 --> 01:51:24.446]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.746 --> 01:51:31.496]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:31.957 --> 01:51:32.497]  What about you?
[01:51:33.243 --> 01:51:38.146]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35.

[01:51:54.662 --> 01:51:54.962]  Thank you.
[01:52:09.807 --> 01:52:10.467]  We're good to go!
[01:52:39.344 --> 01:52:42.429]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:48.459]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:00.014 --> 01:53:06.237]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest, a gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[01:53:06.837 --> 01:53:09.298]  Alright, fellas, we're going to go to you.
[01:53:09.318 --> 01:53:12.519]  Let me start the next hour, so be patient.
[01:53:12.539 --> 01:53:12.639]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:12.659 --> 01:53:20.022]  We're talking to Kurt Nemo, a prolific researcher and journalist and blogger, KurtNemo.com.
[01:53:21.511 --> 01:53:23.973]  Kurt, you heard the question before the break.
[01:53:23.993 --> 01:53:25.214]  Where are we going in the future?
[01:53:25.274 --> 01:53:26.455]  Will Bush be brought down?
[01:53:26.515 --> 01:53:27.156]  Does it matter?
[01:53:27.216 --> 01:53:28.357]  We know he's just a puppet.
[01:53:28.677 --> 01:53:30.098]  I mean, how do we stop these people?
[01:53:30.118 --> 01:53:31.559]  So, what do you see in the future?
[01:53:31.619 --> 01:53:32.920]  What do you think is going to happen?
[01:53:33.541 --> 01:53:36.383]  And then, what are some ideas you have to stop these people?
[01:53:36.443 --> 01:53:38.785]  And in a perfect world, what would you see happen?
[01:53:39.045 --> 01:53:41.167]  Well, I'm not sure what we can do to stop them.
[01:53:42.468 --> 01:53:45.210]  You know, he's in there for the next three years.
[01:53:45.711 --> 01:53:47.693]  You've got a lot of people talking about impeachment.
[01:53:47.853 --> 01:53:49.394]  That's definitely not going to happen.
[01:53:50.075 --> 01:53:50.695]  I don't know.
[01:54:05.014 --> 01:54:07.035]  They're going to engage in black ops in Iraq.
[01:54:07.055 --> 01:54:09.037]  They're going to try to destabilize the whole Middle East.
[01:54:09.137 --> 01:54:14.500]  That's their whole raison d'etre is just taking down, you know, the Middle East.
[01:54:35.094 --> 01:54:36.355]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:54:36.756 --> 01:54:37.917]  Alex, I wanted to interject here.
[01:54:37.937 --> 01:54:43.141]  Did you see today that the Justice Department has indicted Jose Padilla?
[01:54:44.743 --> 01:54:45.463]  I did see that.
[01:54:45.503 --> 01:54:46.464]  Why don't you tell us then on it?
[01:54:46.664 --> 01:54:56.032]  Well, it looks like they're worried about the Supreme Court going against them on this detainee, you know, getting rid of habeas corpus for these detainees.
[01:54:56.153 --> 01:54:58.395]  So what they're going to do is they've indicted him.
[01:54:58.435 --> 01:54:59.275]  They've sent his case.
[01:54:59.455 --> 01:55:01.137]  A grand jury has looked at his case.
[01:55:01.704 --> 01:55:06.051]  And they're forwarding it to the Justice Department and what they're going to do is they're going to try to prosecute him next year for
[01:55:09.526 --> 01:55:15.551]  For giving material support to terrorists and killing and maiming people in the Middle East, which is totally absurd.
[01:55:15.751 --> 01:55:18.113]  Now, they've had this guy for four years.
[01:55:18.573 --> 01:55:30.482]  He was supposedly going to build this dirty bomb, and he literally, again, like the guys the FBI cooked the bomb and trained the drivers in the first World Trade Center bombing, Padilla has got around an 80 IQ.
[01:55:30.522 --> 01:55:31.863]  That's a low-grade moron.
[01:55:32.363 --> 01:55:32.463]  Right.
[01:55:32.783 --> 01:55:34.684]  And it's just a complete joke.
[01:55:34.724 --> 01:55:39.566]  So out of the thousands of people they're holding, they're finally going to, I guess, indict somebody.
[01:55:39.766 --> 01:55:40.567]  Right.
[01:55:41.267 --> 01:55:49.971]  I see the good side of this is that the whole thing about them wanting to hold detainees is not going to work.
[01:55:50.011 --> 01:55:51.572]  The Supreme Court's going to rule against it.
[01:55:52.072 --> 01:55:55.334]  So that's one bright side to this, is that they're actually taking this guy out of the
[01:55:56.841 --> 01:55:59.403]  And they're going to try to prosecute him.
[01:55:59.423 --> 01:55:59.884]  That's right.
[01:55:59.904 --> 01:56:02.566]  An American citizen sitting in a brig for four years.
[01:56:02.866 --> 01:56:03.147]  Right.
[01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:07.510]  So, you know, that's a good side.
[01:56:07.570 --> 01:56:16.678]  That's a good thing is that the Bush administration sees that they cannot do this, get rid of habeas corpus, and deny people their day in court.
[01:56:18.106 --> 01:56:20.849]  So they're going to try to prosecute him on terrorism.
[01:56:21.189 --> 01:56:22.971]  What about government-sponsored terror?
[01:56:22.991 --> 01:56:30.558]  A lot of mainstream people are now saying that the government or elements of the government, criminal elements, may carry out big terror attacks.
[01:56:30.858 --> 01:56:40.447]  We have that White House memo that I believe is authentic, the Capitol Hill Blues reported on, where they're dreaming about how wonderful terrorist attacks would be to get their whole agenda back online.
[01:56:40.487 --> 01:56:43.550]  We have the PNAC document from September 2000 saying the same thing.
[01:56:44.130 --> 01:56:47.392]  Yeah, well, they very well may do something like that.
[01:56:47.432 --> 01:56:54.195]  It looks like what they're doing right now, though, is they're doing these back-to-back or closely spaced terror attacks overseas.
[01:56:54.215 --> 01:57:02.158]  You know, Bali, the one in London, obviously, and the most recent one that they had in Amman, Jordan.
[01:57:02.479 --> 01:57:06.641]  Which just so happens to kill a whole bunch of Palestinian intelligence chiefs and generals.
[01:57:06.661 --> 01:57:11.703]  Yeah, and Chinese students, so-called, from the Chinese National Defense University.
[01:57:12.447 --> 01:57:14.308]  Um, yeah, that was obviously a Mossad hit.
[01:57:14.548 --> 01:57:26.432]  Um, I think that Mossad and the CIA and MI6 are working together in this freelance, um... But, I mean, they openly run precision hits on their enemies and then Al Zakari supposedly is behind it.
[01:57:26.652 --> 01:57:28.613]  Stay there, we'll talk about all of it in one minute.
[01:57:28.873 --> 01:57:31.474]  We'll be right back with a third hour in one minute and continue.

[01:57:49.859 --> 01:57:50.519]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.159 --> 01:57:52.240]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:54.060]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:55.501]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.261 --> 01:57:58.182]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.202 --> 01:58:01.804]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.004 --> 01:58:06.106]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:21.477 --> 01:58:21.898]  We're here.
[01:58:22.398 --> 01:58:23.619]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:58:24.079 --> 01:58:28.042]  Curt Nemo, blogger and of course journalist joins us.
[01:58:28.062 --> 01:58:29.203]  He does a lot of great work.
[01:58:29.623 --> 01:58:30.944]  CurtNemo.com.
[01:58:30.964 --> 01:58:32.605]  We'll tell you how to spell it a little bit later.
[01:58:32.645 --> 01:58:36.828]  Big fat links up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:36.928 --> 01:58:37.428]  Over to Curt.
[01:58:38.803 --> 01:58:41.264]  And yes, your calls are coming up directly in the next segment.
[01:58:41.284 --> 01:58:42.825]  A whole host of issues I want to talk about.
[01:58:43.265 --> 01:58:45.686]  I want to throw some of these out at Kurt and get his take on them.
[01:58:45.706 --> 01:58:47.926]  But Kurt, you were bringing up the London bombings.
[01:58:48.066 --> 01:58:50.107]  Clearly MI6 caught red-handed.
[01:58:50.427 --> 01:58:51.648]  Hundreds of pieces of evidence.
[01:58:51.688 --> 01:58:53.688]  Just a porgy of evidence.
[01:58:53.728 --> 01:58:54.749]  Very ridiculous there.
[01:58:55.649 --> 01:58:59.731]  Clearly, when you look at what happened over in Jordan, clearly government op.
[01:59:02.231 --> 01:59:03.072]  Al-Zaqqari.
[01:59:04.172 --> 01:59:05.673]  Now they claim they killed him again.
[01:59:05.693 --> 01:59:06.353]  I mean, that'll be what
[01:59:07.202 --> 01:59:08.362]  Over 10 times they've killed him.
[01:59:08.382 --> 01:59:09.643]  They've captured him over 10 times.
[01:59:09.663 --> 01:59:12.623]  They've killed his deputies dozens and dozens and dozens of times.
[01:59:12.843 --> 01:59:16.264]  And they never retract the last killing or the last capturing.
[01:59:16.684 --> 01:59:18.365]  Why are they doing it so blatant?
[01:59:18.425 --> 01:59:21.586]  It's like, Kurt, they want us to see how obvious it is.
[01:59:21.746 --> 01:59:22.726]  Well, that's possible.
[01:59:23.046 --> 01:59:26.347]  You know, as well, I think that they don't really care.
[01:59:26.367 --> 01:59:27.027]  I think that they
[01:59:27.745 --> 01:59:45.297]  They realize that the American public is dumbed down, that they go from one terror incident to the other, one instance of a boogeyman coming out, you know, and showing his fangs to another, and people really, I mean, you take a look at it, people think al-Zarqari exists.
[01:59:45.317 --> 01:59:45.918]  I mean, it's obvious.
[01:59:46.939 --> 01:59:50.161]  The facts prove that he died in northern Iraq.
[01:59:51.105 --> 01:59:53.246]  Well, that's why he's perfect!
[01:59:53.327 --> 01:59:54.687]  I mean, he's somebody who's dead!
[01:59:54.827 --> 01:59:56.428]  He's our Emmanuel Goldstein!
[01:59:56.589 --> 02:00:02.752]  Are we going to have colonies on Mars in a hundred years, and if the air processors break, it was al-Zaqqari?
[02:00:03.073 --> 02:00:03.973]  Right, exactly.
[02:00:03.993 --> 02:00:15.800]  You know, the guy supposedly has one leg, he's a certifiable idiot, and they use him as their boogeyman, and nobody calls him on it, and the corporate media is certainly not going to call him on it.
[02:00:17.768 --> 02:00:19.369]  He's going to continue living forever.
[02:00:19.409 --> 02:00:22.091]  He's like Emanuel Goldstein from a three-minute hate session.
[02:00:22.572 --> 02:00:22.992]  Exactly, 1984.
[02:00:23.412 --> 02:00:25.334]  What about Berg?
[02:00:25.374 --> 02:00:31.018]  I mean, Berg has more connections to Alciada than Padilla does.
[02:00:31.478 --> 02:00:46.489]  I mean, he's constantly... I mean, there's hundreds of connections there, but, you know, he's loaning his laptop to hijackers when he's working at the Air Force base there at the private flight school down in Oklahoma City, and he's connected in with
[02:00:47.089 --> 02:00:51.813]  Well, from what I understand, he was dead already when they cut his head off.
[02:00:51.833 --> 02:00:58.179]  You look at the videotape and the experts looked at it and they said, this guy, there would have been blood gushing out of his throat and head there, but that didn't happen.
[02:01:15.277 --> 02:01:16.418]  I think he was a patsy.
[02:01:16.439 --> 02:01:17.079]  He was set up.
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:24.006]  He actually, I believe he thought that he was going to get those contracts for the, I forget what it was exactly, he was doing.
[02:01:24.046 --> 02:01:28.030]  The Babylon Towers.
[02:01:28.211 --> 02:01:36.219]  Yeah, he was just another patsy set up and they used him to show the American people that these guys are ruthless and that Al Zakari is out there.
[02:01:36.239 --> 02:01:37.300]  And if you take a look at the video,
[02:01:38.041 --> 02:01:39.543]  It's obvious these guys are military.
[02:01:39.583 --> 02:01:41.546]  You can tell by the way they're standing.
[02:01:41.566 --> 02:01:42.808]  Well, they're big guys.
[02:01:42.848 --> 02:01:52.283]  Yeah, they're big guys, but they don't have a small stature of Arabs, and they have a military aspect to them in their stature, and it's total nonsense.
[02:01:53.070 --> 02:01:53.911]  Well, exactly.
[02:01:53.971 --> 02:01:56.272]  I mean, you look at the people holding Pearl.
[02:01:56.312 --> 02:01:59.935]  That was real skinny, hawk-like, tiny wrist.
[02:02:00.195 --> 02:02:02.216]  You got these big ol' good ol' boys from Texas.
[02:02:02.637 --> 02:02:04.478]  We're gonna cut your head off, boy!
[02:02:04.938 --> 02:02:06.019]  Swagger on over.
[02:02:06.319 --> 02:02:07.340]  It was so obvious.
[02:02:07.780 --> 02:02:08.540]  It was definitely obvious.
[02:02:08.561 --> 02:02:10.382]  Plus, it's obviously Abu Ghraib, too.
[02:02:10.742 --> 02:02:11.142]  Oh, yeah.
[02:02:11.282 --> 02:02:14.164]  You got the same chairs, the same paint, the same flooring.
[02:02:14.585 --> 02:02:15.025]  Exactly.
[02:02:16.076 --> 02:02:17.136]  Well, how dare you, Kurt?
[02:02:17.156 --> 02:02:18.617]  You sit there and look at the basic facts.
[02:02:19.537 --> 02:02:20.277]  So, you know what?
[02:02:20.577 --> 02:02:20.917]  You're right.
[02:02:20.957 --> 02:02:21.877]  There's hardly any blood.
[02:02:21.937 --> 02:02:22.977]  He could have been killed.
[02:02:23.958 --> 02:02:25.498]  He could have been shot right over the fence.
[02:02:25.518 --> 02:02:26.638]  They just drug him in and did that.
[02:02:27.678 --> 02:02:28.379]  Very possible.
[02:02:28.419 --> 02:02:30.539]  I mean, he might have been killed by insurgents.
[02:02:30.559 --> 02:02:31.139]  You never know.
[02:02:31.319 --> 02:02:34.300]  We just know, folks, that Bergey was one of their boys.
[02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:43.082]  And if our government will take our troops and nerve gas them to test the nerve gas, don't think they won't take a CIA pop and cut his head off for you and your family.
[02:02:43.422 --> 02:02:44.782]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.676 --> 02:02:49.518]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.778 --> 02:02:51.360]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.700 --> 02:02:56.363]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.724 --> 02:03:03.469]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.789 --> 02:03:05.750]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:05.970 --> 02:03:08.811]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.911 --> 02:03:13.573]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.773 --> 02:03:18.174]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.415 --> 02:03:25.637]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:47.409 --> 02:03:48.450]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.770 --> 02:03:51.552]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.832 --> 02:03:55.994]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.414 --> 02:03:57.255]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.555 --> 02:04:02.118]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.611 --> 02:04:04.732]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.232 --> 02:04:19.918]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:19.958 --> 02:04:27.021]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:04:45.476 --> 02:04:47.017]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:04:47.177 --> 02:04:48.298]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:04:48.478 --> 02:04:51.881]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:52.001 --> 02:04:52.441]  Phenol?
[02:04:52.742 --> 02:04:59.847]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:05:00.167 --> 02:05:04.270]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:05:04.371 --> 02:05:04.811]  Fragrance?
[02:05:05.191 --> 02:05:09.952]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:05:10.073 --> 02:05:14.774]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:05:14.994 --> 02:05:17.555]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Calben shampoo.
[02:05:17.815 --> 02:05:21.216]  Well, like all of the products from the Calben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.

[02:05:46.781 --> 02:05:52.823]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.423 --> 02:05:56.464]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.084 --> 02:05:59.885]  Kurt Nimmo riding shotgun with us.
[02:05:59.945 --> 02:06:01.085]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:06:01.125 --> 02:06:04.806]  We're going to go to your calls here momentarily.
[02:06:06.486 --> 02:06:11.708]  Kurt was bringing up a lot of key points along the road, and one of them is that we
[02:06:12.646 --> 02:06:15.428]  Even folks that are on the air, we tend to move on to the next thing.
[02:06:15.768 --> 02:06:23.433]  And we just forget all the lies, all the staged events, all the times we've caught the government red-handed carrying out terror attacks.
[02:06:24.054 --> 02:06:37.523]  Curt Nemo, I want to talk about some of the articles that you're currently writing, some of the things you're currently working on, some of the things you think are most important right now, and again, your solutions, ways to at least slow this program down, because people are really waking up right now.
[02:06:37.543 --> 02:06:42.146]  And in a moment I want to go to some calls before we do that, but
[02:06:43.141 --> 02:06:45.402]  Other examples of red-handed government terror.
[02:06:45.422 --> 02:06:53.284]  I mean, we knew 30-something years ago, because people, day one, told the San Diego Tribune that Gulf of Tonkin was staged.
[02:06:53.364 --> 02:06:55.424]  Now we have the LBJ tapes for two years.
[02:06:55.744 --> 02:06:58.385]  Now the CIA documents were released of how they staged it.
[02:06:58.665 --> 02:07:00.386]  And that killed 58,000 Americans.
[02:07:00.786 --> 02:07:01.606]  That little pretext.
[02:07:02.347 --> 02:07:03.747]  Didn't kill any on the day of the event.
[02:07:04.248 --> 02:07:11.429]  We know that the USS Liberty now is totally staged between Israel and LBJ to be blamed on Egypt for World War III.
[02:07:11.909 --> 02:07:14.850]  They plan to widen that thing and take over the Middle East right then and there.
[02:07:15.350 --> 02:07:22.092]  We know that they wanted to carry out Northwoods and kill Marines and blame it on Cuba and bomb DC and hijack jets by remote control and crash them.
[02:07:22.652 --> 02:07:27.015]  We know that they blew up buildings and attacked Moss to blame it on Mozadek in 1953.
[02:07:27.635 --> 02:07:29.436]  We know they've done this over and over.
[02:07:29.716 --> 02:07:35.279]  Project Gladio going on until 1980 with the Bologna train bombing, killing hundreds.
[02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:37.401]  Openly blaming it on their political enemies.
[02:07:37.441 --> 02:07:41.823]  I mean, our government, if anybody carries out terror, it is the criminals running our government.
[02:07:42.824 --> 02:07:45.405]  Kurt, I mean, isn't it important to bring this up to people?
[02:07:45.425 --> 02:07:46.626]  Oh, definitely.
[02:07:46.646 --> 02:07:51.649]  Unfortunately, most people watch corporate news and they don't know about these things.
[02:07:52.332 --> 02:08:08.257]  The corporate news doesn't tell us about the Gulf of Tonkin incident, doesn't tell us about FDR knowing about the US military breaking the Japanese code, or the Lusitania in World War I, or the situation in Cuba with the Maine.
[02:08:08.317 --> 02:08:09.378]  You know, we just don't know.
[02:08:09.758 --> 02:08:19.541]  Our history doesn't teach it, our schools don't teach it, and most Americans don't know about these things, and they just really, they don't wake up to the fact that this is how government is.
[02:08:22.719 --> 02:08:26.420]  Well, you're right, but I'd have to say that more and more people are.
[02:08:27.201 --> 02:08:45.847]  Whereas you've got a mass of individuals who willfully are getting stupider and stupider, there is a larger and larger cadre or group of Americans, a swelling group, that really do see what's happening and are getting more and more cynical and more and more angry about the things that this, this, uh, this corporatocracy is doing.
[02:08:46.407 --> 02:08:50.769]  Well, hopefully, you know, there'll be more shows like yours and more people will give up.
[02:08:51.536 --> 02:08:52.917]  People are getting on the web every day.
[02:08:52.977 --> 02:09:02.843]  More and more people are getting on the web every day and they're looking at these blogs like mine and they're going and they're looking at the other alternative news sites and they're starting to slowly but surely learn what the real story is.
[02:09:03.284 --> 02:09:07.866]  Unfortunately, and I hate to be pessimistic about this, not enough are doing it to make a difference.
[02:09:09.087 --> 02:09:10.088]  We don't have much time.
[02:09:10.168 --> 02:09:13.230]  As you point out every time you run your show, we don't have much time.
[02:09:13.909 --> 02:09:14.329]  I think so.
[02:09:28.226 --> 02:09:31.849]  Maybe tune out of corporate television and get on the web and take a look.
[02:09:32.069 --> 02:09:32.829]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:09:32.849 --> 02:09:39.074]  I mean, it takes years for us to expose a Bill Clinton as evil, or years to expose a Bush as evil, and finally people listen to us.
[02:09:39.414 --> 02:09:53.324]  But by then they put in what I call new birdcage liner, you know, a whole new puppet, and then everybody gets caught up in the spectacle of that political fight, and then we get politically invested, and we have an investiture, and who wins, and it's all just
[02:09:53.764 --> 02:09:55.865]  Smoke and mirrors theater, folks.
[02:09:55.925 --> 02:10:05.150]  Until we get out of that full cycle and get down to actually, you know, who the interests are that own our politicians, it's only going to get worse.
[02:10:05.170 --> 02:10:15.196]  I mean, I'm sure you're aware of the New York Observer articles about Hillary and Rupert Murdoch lavishing each other, you know, in these four-hour meetings, you know, these lavish caviar meetings, four hours every week.
[02:10:15.236 --> 02:10:16.056]  I mean, it's staged.
[02:10:16.076 --> 02:10:19.098]  The Clintons and the Bushes in business going back into the 60s.
[02:10:19.538 --> 02:10:20.659]  It's all staged.
[02:10:21.139 --> 02:10:22.400]  And yeah, it's going to be
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:23.460]  We're good to go.
[02:10:48.192 --> 02:10:49.754]  We keep voting for the same people.
[02:10:49.794 --> 02:10:52.536]  We keep using, you know, you have Kerry and Bush.
[02:10:52.576 --> 02:10:54.618]  Well, we all know that they're both Bonesmen.
[02:10:54.658 --> 02:10:57.781]  They're both on the same page, you know.
[02:10:59.542 --> 02:11:00.663]  So it doesn't really matter.
[02:11:00.683 --> 02:11:05.628]  As long as people continue to vote for these people, they don't really need to do anything too terrible.
[02:11:06.338 --> 02:11:14.280]  Well also we stay focused on the Presidency all day and we get 65% turnouts for that and an 8% turnout nationally for local elections.
[02:11:14.340 --> 02:11:16.401]  We need to, that's what we can really take over.
[02:11:16.421 --> 02:11:18.201]  Yeah, it starts locally, definitely.
[02:11:21.122 --> 02:11:27.624]  Let's go to some calls, but then Kurt I want you to think about some solutions because I respect your view on this and I also want to get your take on
[02:11:29.614 --> 02:11:31.336]  I mean, I want you to look into that crystal ball.
[02:11:31.536 --> 02:11:33.278]  Figuratively, folks, I don't mean that seriously.
[02:11:33.898 --> 02:11:37.442]  And tell us what you think is going to unfold.
[02:11:37.622 --> 02:11:40.805]  Just the basics of the next year, next two years, next five years.
[02:11:41.166 --> 02:11:43.048]  I want to get your prognosis on things.
[02:11:43.528 --> 02:11:45.230]  Let's go to Michael in Little Rock, Arkansas.
[02:11:45.330 --> 02:11:46.431]  I've been holding for a long time.
[02:11:46.451 --> 02:11:50.075]  And then we'll go to George and Jose and Eric and others.
[02:11:50.495 --> 02:11:50.775]  Go ahead.
[02:11:50.795 --> 02:11:51.276]  You're on the air.
[02:11:52.223 --> 02:11:53.244]  Can you hear me good, Alex?
[02:11:53.324 --> 02:11:53.704]  Yes, sir.
[02:11:53.724 --> 02:12:11.895]  Well, I just want to thank you for everything that you've done, and you know, for a long time, I thought I was this lone kind of conspiracy theory, you know, out in the woods, and nobody believed me, but it's good to know that there are people out there who do vigorously pursue the truth.
[02:12:11.975 --> 02:12:14.296]  So I just want to thank you for that and all the work that you do.
[02:12:14.316 --> 02:12:16.217]  Well, I want to thank you, sir.
[02:12:16.297 --> 02:12:21.060]  Are you seeing that people in Little Rock are starting to wake up a little bit, or are they just buying the whole agenda?
[02:12:21.621 --> 02:12:47.087]  Well, I want to start off by saying I spent three years in the 82nd Airborne Division out at Fort Bratton, North Carolina, and I was in a combat unit, and I would like to consider myself a patriot, and I very carefully read over the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, and it's just... I don't want to be pessimistic, but you can't protect your rights unless you know what your rights are.
[02:12:47.842 --> 02:12:52.185]  And a lot of people need to be educated about what their constitutional rights are.
[02:12:52.605 --> 02:12:53.106]  Well, you're right.
[02:12:53.126 --> 02:12:54.307]  They'll say, I've got rights!
[02:12:54.507 --> 02:12:56.008]  And you go, OK, well, what are your rights?
[02:12:56.328 --> 02:12:57.069]  Right, right.
[02:12:57.169 --> 02:12:58.930]  And, you know, what's this amendment mean?
[02:12:58.990 --> 02:12:59.991]  What's this amendment mean?
[02:13:00.491 --> 02:13:01.832]  And so on and so forth.
[02:13:01.912 --> 02:13:13.200]  But, you know, I hate to say it almost, but it almost looks like it's getting to the point to where it's just going to be like the Declaration of Independence and we're going to have to take up arms and overthrow the government.
[02:13:13.490 --> 02:13:18.692]  I agree, and it sounds radical, and I'm not a jingoist, and I'm not a violent person.
[02:13:18.712 --> 02:13:19.672]  That's not what I want.
[02:13:19.692 --> 02:13:24.434]  Well, I mean, it's not radical when you've got Paul Craig Roberts saying Nazis run the government.
[02:13:24.694 --> 02:13:33.297]  They can carry out terror attacks when... I mean, look at how many... Ron Paul said they may declare martial law, set up Nazi Germany, and come for our guns.
[02:13:33.337 --> 02:13:34.277]  By the way, he's on tomorrow.
[02:13:35.177 --> 02:13:37.278]  I mean, think about Ray McGovern.
[02:13:37.338 --> 02:13:40.479]  Think about all these prominent people that are saying what you're now saying.
[02:13:40.979 --> 02:13:42.820]  Yeah, and I hate it, too.
[02:13:43.613 --> 02:13:54.338]  And I'm not going to go into what unit, but I'm a member of the military and I just hate the way that, you know, Bush gets out of a jet, you know, he hot dogs in front of everybody.
[02:13:54.879 --> 02:13:56.600]  You know, Bush isn't a soldier.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:14:00.221]  You know, he's not, he doesn't have a warrior ethos.
[02:14:00.301 --> 02:14:03.783]  He doesn't follow the military code of honor or any of this stuff.
[02:14:03.823 --> 02:14:09.026]  He makes himself out to be this big, you know, wartime, I'm this great leader, but he's not.
[02:14:09.286 --> 02:14:13.148]  Well, the only time he'll be seen in public now is with troops behind him.
[02:14:14.372 --> 02:14:16.473]  Well, yeah, but he's not for the troops.
[02:14:16.733 --> 02:14:17.433]  That's the thing.
[02:14:17.494 --> 02:14:18.554]  He's not for the troops.
[02:14:18.594 --> 02:14:19.454]  He's not a soldier.
[02:14:19.534 --> 02:14:20.515]  He's not one of us.
[02:14:21.135 --> 02:14:27.398]  You know, personally, I'd like to put him in Baghdad for about a month and have him go out with the infantry squad and patrol.
[02:14:27.858 --> 02:14:29.639]  If I had my way, I'd have him do that.
[02:14:29.939 --> 02:14:34.161]  Well, I'd have those little snot-nosed, dullard daughters of his do it.
[02:14:34.602 --> 02:14:37.923]  Yeah, and we got, what is it, 520 members of Congress?
[02:14:38.003 --> 02:14:39.524]  Is that right or am I exaggerating that?
[02:14:40.146 --> 02:14:41.407]  No, that's about right.
[02:14:41.727 --> 02:14:43.989]  Except they're like 520 members of Congress.
[02:14:44.169 --> 02:14:45.750]  They all... It's 400 or something.
[02:14:46.690 --> 02:14:47.271]  I'm sorry.
[02:14:48.151 --> 02:14:53.955]  But we have hundreds of members of Congress and, you know, not one of them has a son or daughter in Iraq.
[02:14:54.335 --> 02:14:56.677]  But they're real quick to vote to send us over.
[02:14:57.297 --> 02:15:04.522]  Well, listen, almost every one of them's got giant $100 million contracts, literally, personally, with companies that are making money off the war.
[02:15:04.542 --> 02:15:07.204]  I mean, each one of those is a felony action.
[02:15:07.584 --> 02:15:09.065]  You see, nothing's enforced now.
[02:15:09.685 --> 02:15:20.635]  They'll enforce some petty marijuana law on your 12-year-old who's got caught with marijuana the first time they smoked it, but they won't enforce felony laws on Halliburton.
[02:15:20.775 --> 02:15:35.528]  Well, the thing is, in the Oath of Enlistment, the first thing that an enlisted soldier says is, he says, I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the United States Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[02:15:36.235 --> 02:15:42.056]  Okay, and then it goes into, I will obey the orders of my superior officers and the President of the United States.
[02:15:42.656 --> 02:15:50.638]  And what a lot of soldiers don't realize is that, that first statement, I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States, that's paramount.
[02:15:50.918 --> 02:15:53.099]  So that means, it doesn't matter who it is.
[02:15:53.239 --> 02:15:57.700]  If it's the President, if it's different... Well, you know, they changed the oath before.
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:15:59.820]  It didn't have that little line about the President.
[02:16:00.465 --> 02:16:07.552]  So, that's been altered over time, but now we're hearing, if you support the troops, don't criticize the President.
[02:16:07.632 --> 02:16:09.674]  It's hurting the troops' feelings.
[02:16:09.774 --> 02:16:16.900]  So, the so-called liberal media is doing everything they can right now to say it's not kosher to criticize the war.
[02:16:17.221 --> 02:16:20.644]  Well, folks, if we're sticking troops into a meat grinder, which is designed to fail,
[02:16:23.795 --> 02:16:25.595]  Look, ask your friends in your unit.
[02:16:25.896 --> 02:16:30.437]  Do the defense contractors make more money if you're there 6 months and get the power back on and leave?
[02:16:30.837 --> 02:16:32.757]  Or do they make more money if you're there 20 years?
[02:16:33.177 --> 02:16:35.238]  Yeah, they're going to make more money the longer that you're there.
[02:16:35.258 --> 02:16:36.478]  It's just like Vietnam.
[02:16:36.538 --> 02:16:44.140]  I mean, this war has... And I haven't served in Iraq, and I'm not trying to denigrate the efforts of the men and women over there.
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:45.400]  I admire their courage.
[02:16:46.080 --> 02:16:49.701]  But this isn't about national security.
[02:16:50.179 --> 02:16:51.539]  It's not about national security.
[02:16:51.979 --> 02:16:53.040]  It's about greed.
[02:16:53.500 --> 02:16:54.320]  It's about oil.
[02:16:54.400 --> 02:16:55.380]  It's about control.
[02:16:55.560 --> 02:16:57.901]  It's about terrorizing the public.
[02:16:58.461 --> 02:17:08.423]  And I hate it because America's most selfless volunteers, the people who go out, you know, they're in the heat, they're in the mud, they're in the dust.
[02:17:08.783 --> 02:17:12.664]  You know, they're being shot at, they're being rocketed, etc.
[02:17:12.704 --> 02:17:13.264]  and so on.
[02:17:13.304 --> 02:17:14.864]  All these brave young men and women.
[02:17:15.305 --> 02:17:16.785]  And it just disgusts me
[02:17:17.620 --> 02:17:24.805]  It just disgusts me that they're out there defending, you know, what they believe to be national security, but they're being lied to by a political leader.
[02:17:24.825 --> 02:17:25.105]  They are.
[02:17:25.125 --> 02:17:25.846]  Look, look, look.
[02:17:27.146 --> 02:17:28.988]  The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
[02:17:29.048 --> 02:17:30.008]  It's compartmentalized.
[02:17:30.028 --> 02:17:36.393]  Some of the best people you can imagine, who are good people deep in their hearts, they're being conned by the most evil people you can imagine.
[02:17:36.413 --> 02:17:37.013]  I agree with you, sir.
[02:17:37.293 --> 02:17:39.835]  It's like if Bush ordered the troops to go stand in traffic.
[02:17:40.135 --> 02:17:42.717]  Look how brave they are, letting 18-wheelers run over them.
[02:17:43.037 --> 02:17:43.938]  It's a bad mission.
[02:17:46.306 --> 02:17:50.209]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?

[02:19:47.338 --> 02:19:51.842]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:19:52.203 --> 02:19:56.287]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:19:56.567 --> 02:19:57.128]  We listened.
[02:19:57.428 --> 02:20:02.413]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:20:02.693 --> 02:20:03.173]  We listened.
[02:20:03.574 --> 02:20:06.617]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:20:07.017 --> 02:20:07.578]  We listened.
[02:20:08.038 --> 02:20:11.101]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:20:11.421 --> 02:20:11.982]  We're good to go.

[02:21:52.059 --> 02:21:53.340]  Eric and Andy and others here.
[02:21:53.360 --> 02:21:54.301]  We've got Kurt Nemo.
[02:21:55.102 --> 02:21:56.744]  Kurtnemo.com.
[02:21:58.525 --> 02:22:03.290]  Kurt, I get calls like that on air everyday from soldiers who've been in Iraq, who've been out of Iraq.
[02:22:04.654 --> 02:22:09.577]  Who are serving here domestically but haven't been in country or have been in Germany or Afghanistan.
[02:22:10.078 --> 02:22:17.102]  But then when we turn on the news we hear every soldier worships the government, every soldier loves the war, give them what they want, keep them in the war.
[02:22:17.563 --> 02:22:22.306]  Bush has been caught having staged press conferences with troops who were told exactly what to say.
[02:22:22.326 --> 02:22:29.851]  Yeah, that caller is absolutely right about the Constitution as far as, I mean take a look at who's in the military.
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:34.062]  Mostly working-class people who are victims of public education.
[02:22:34.142 --> 02:22:42.027]  I mean, I'm 53 years old, I went through public education, and I'll tell you, even back in those days, they did not teach us about the Constitution.
[02:22:43.068 --> 02:22:48.971]  You know, they gave us little stories about the Revolution, but they really did not go into the heart of the Constitution.
[02:22:49.431 --> 02:22:56.936]  So it's not surprising that most Americans, especially those in Iraq, don't understand what their duty is to the Constitution.
[02:22:58.675 --> 02:22:59.975]  How do we turn that around?
[02:23:00.035 --> 02:23:03.516]  How do we get people to value the Bill of Rights and Constitution again?
[02:23:03.797 --> 02:23:09.558]  Well, they need to stop being brainwashed, and public education is the thing that really brainwashes people the most.
[02:23:10.919 --> 02:23:11.739]  How to get them out of there?
[02:23:11.779 --> 02:23:12.619]  I'm not really sure.
[02:23:12.679 --> 02:23:15.500]  It seems overwhelming that most people are so ignorant.
[02:23:15.520 --> 02:23:16.740]  They don't understand the Constitution.
[02:23:16.760 --> 02:23:17.961]  They don't understand the Bill of Rights.
[02:23:18.581 --> 02:23:21.862]  They don't even understand what the founding fathers had to say about liberty.
[02:23:22.943 --> 02:23:24.365]  Well, also financially.
[02:23:24.385 --> 02:23:32.912]  I mean, I have read government documents going back even 60, 70 years where they said the American people are too educated, too informed.
[02:23:33.773 --> 02:23:40.059]  Banking documents by the National Banking Association saying we've got to lobby for this type of education, this Prussian model.
[02:23:41.195 --> 02:23:41.735]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:24:09.671 --> 02:24:12.755]  I'll be honest with you, Alex, I am not sure how to turn it around.
[02:24:13.115 --> 02:24:14.157]  I really am not sure.
[02:24:14.517 --> 02:24:25.412]  When I consider how massive the ignorance is in this country, and there's a lot of good people out there, you know, they're on your show every day, and I encounter them every day as well, who are intelligent, but
[02:24:26.221 --> 02:24:27.543]  It just seems pervasive.
[02:24:27.603 --> 02:24:28.925]  The ignorance seems pervasive.
[02:24:28.945 --> 02:24:30.207]  But, Kurt, here's the good news.
[02:24:30.387 --> 02:24:33.773]  Evil people look at that and go, hey, let's rip these idiots off.
[02:24:33.833 --> 02:24:37.959]  That's what Bush and Clinton and minions like that say.
[02:24:38.259 --> 02:24:39.561]  That's what David Rockefeller says.
[02:24:39.601 --> 02:24:41.064]  They actually laugh at us.
[02:24:42.632 --> 02:24:45.375]  For those of us that love freedom, it's just like 1776.
[02:24:45.915 --> 02:24:50.079]  It was 5% that started the war, and it was 5% that won the war.
[02:24:50.099 --> 02:24:54.543]  There were only 40,000 people total in almost 8 years of combat on the U.S.
[02:24:54.563 --> 02:24:54.923]  side.
[02:24:54.944 --> 02:24:56.765]  8 to 1 against the British.
[02:24:56.825 --> 02:25:03.952]  So don't ever think, Kurt, I mean my little piece of advice to you, I know it's daunting, don't ever think we need these people.
[02:25:04.432 --> 02:25:06.714]  I mean, they actually don't even fit into the equation.
[02:25:06.754 --> 02:25:12.980]  Somebody drooling eating cheeseburgers, who doesn't even care about their own children's upbringing, they're not going to fight on either side.
[02:25:13.000 --> 02:25:13.961]  They're just going to drool.
[02:25:14.342 --> 02:25:14.562]  Right.
[02:25:15.202 --> 02:25:15.383]  Right.
[02:25:15.863 --> 02:25:16.864]  Let's take a call here.
[02:25:16.904 --> 02:25:20.447]  Let's talk to George in Chicago, then Jose and others.
[02:25:20.487 --> 02:25:20.788]  Go ahead.
[02:25:20.808 --> 02:25:21.608]  You're on the air, George.
[02:25:22.449 --> 02:25:23.750]  Alex, good show as always.
[02:25:23.971 --> 02:25:24.331]  Thank you.
[02:25:25.232 --> 02:25:29.516]  Two hours ago, you mentioned the key word, mindless idiot.
[02:25:30.549 --> 02:25:31.570]  Personally, you know what?
[02:25:31.770 --> 02:25:36.954]  I don't even care about the Bushes, the Pat Robinsons, the Kentons, the Schwarzeneggers.
[02:25:38.455 --> 02:25:43.219]  My question is, who runs these mindless idiots, these servants?
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:46.702]  Let's expose the shattered government by name.
[02:25:47.082 --> 02:25:51.966]  Are these the European Royalty, the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds, the Gorbachevs, the Coens?
[02:25:52.226 --> 02:25:53.227]  Who are these guys?
[02:25:53.407 --> 02:25:56.550]  I mean, I don't care about the Democrats, the Republicans.
[02:25:56.610 --> 02:25:58.071]  For me, they're all the same anyways.
[02:25:58.786 --> 02:25:59.607]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:25:59.627 --> 02:26:07.893]  When you said Gorbachev, you're talking about a minion of greater stature than, say, a super gopher like Hans Kissinger.
[02:26:09.034 --> 02:26:11.676]  But it's the classic names.
[02:26:12.097 --> 02:26:14.759]  I mean, I have a book right here from my own research.
[02:26:14.799 --> 02:26:16.801]  Those are the names that come up over and over again.
[02:26:17.661 --> 02:26:19.883]  But it really is the bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[02:26:20.443 --> 02:26:22.245]  And it really is the Koburgs.
[02:26:22.305 --> 02:26:23.045]  It is the Sachs.
[02:26:23.106 --> 02:26:23.886]  It is the Gothas.
[02:26:23.926 --> 02:26:24.887]  It is the Oppenheimers.
[02:26:25.227 --> 02:26:26.188]  It is the Rothschilds.
[02:26:26.228 --> 02:26:27.229]  It is the Rockefellers.
[02:26:28.033 --> 02:26:40.155]  It is the same old classic names, and when you go research, who owns BP, who owns Dutch Rochelle, who owns controlling shares in your media companies, who owns the Carlisle Group, who owns the... It's the Queen of England!
[02:26:40.775 --> 02:26:42.696]  Let's make a show about these people, Alex.
[02:26:42.836 --> 02:26:45.936]  Who cares about dumb Bush and dumb Clinton and these other cronies?
[02:26:46.136 --> 02:26:50.477]  Well, we're going to have more and more guests on about them, and we do talk about them.
[02:26:50.917 --> 02:26:54.118]  And every time I talk about Bush, I talk about how he's a puppet.
[02:26:54.618 --> 02:26:55.818]  Yeah, let's expose the other guys.
[02:26:56.696 --> 02:26:58.016]  It's exposed the shadow government.
[02:26:58.657 --> 02:26:59.577]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:26:59.617 --> 02:27:01.497]  We should do more to do that, Kurt.
[02:27:02.017 --> 02:27:02.798]  Yeah, definitely.
[02:27:02.998 --> 02:27:08.619]  Unfortunately, the media makes you out to be a total idiot when you talk about those connections.
[02:27:08.899 --> 02:27:09.879]  Look at Kurt Nemo.
[02:27:09.939 --> 02:27:11.540]  He believes there's a global elite.
[02:27:12.000 --> 02:27:16.361]  The planet's always had elites that run things, but he says they exist now.
[02:27:16.721 --> 02:27:18.782]  And then you get a guy like Tucker Carlson on there.
[02:27:19.162 --> 02:27:23.563]  You talk about 9-11 and what Stephen Jones has revealed, and he says, well, we're the country.
[02:27:24.255 --> 02:27:25.536]  I tell you what, we got that clip.
[02:27:25.556 --> 02:27:30.458]  We'll just play part of it when we get back, because I want to go directly to Jose, who's been holding like a champion.
[02:27:30.558 --> 02:27:32.239]  Eric and Andy and others.
[02:27:32.259 --> 02:27:34.320]  I've got a few other news items I want to hit with our guests.
[02:27:34.340 --> 02:27:34.800]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.061 --> 02:27:36.941]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.441 --> 02:27:39.042]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.963 --> 02:27:42.644]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.020 --> 02:27:48.641]  Government is best what governs least.
[02:27:49.181 --> 02:27:50.481]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:27:50.941 --> 02:27:53.642]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:27:54.083 --> 02:27:56.724]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:27:57.164 --> 02:28:03.646]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:28:27.013 --> 02:28:28.533]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[02:28:31.774 --> 02:28:32.454]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:28:38.795 --> 02:28:39.976]  Oh, some have been forgotten.

[02:28:59.010 --> 02:29:03.674]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:04.154 --> 02:29:10.856]  The Murky Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.

[02:29:49.875 --> 02:29:50.595]  have diabetes.
[02:29:50.936 --> 02:29:57.881]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[02:29:58.041 --> 02:30:02.565]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[02:30:02.765 --> 02:30:05.587]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.

[02:30:48.596 --> 02:30:57.682]  I'm going to play just part of this Tucker Carlson clip with Professor Jones of last Monday.
[02:30:59.583 --> 02:31:05.366]  And then we're going to go to Jose and Eric and Andy and wrap this broadcast up.
[02:31:06.667 --> 02:31:11.712]  With a few other questions I've got for our guest, Kurt Nemo, KurtNemo.com.
[02:31:12.112 --> 02:31:17.377]  Kurt, before I go to this little clip and then to the calls, tell us how to spell Nemo?
[02:31:17.857 --> 02:31:20.199]  It's N-I-M-M-O.
[02:31:21.320 --> 02:31:24.003]  N-I, two M's and an O, and Kurt, K-U-R-T.
[02:31:24.763 --> 02:31:25.284]  All one word.
[02:31:25.624 --> 02:31:26.004]  Exactly.
[02:31:26.045 --> 02:31:31.109]  Or just give it a try into a major search engine and KurtNemo.com will come right up first there.
[02:31:31.189 --> 02:31:32.891]  Seriously, I'm not just tooting your horn.
[02:31:34.088 --> 02:31:40.470]  You do a really great job, and it's good to have other minds out there that really see clearly and pick up on the same things that we pick up on.
[02:31:40.490 --> 02:31:44.412]  It's very encouraging, because this is about survival for Alex Jones, folks.
[02:31:44.892 --> 02:31:46.032]  I know how real this is.
[02:31:46.133 --> 02:31:47.573]  I know how dangerous these people are.
[02:31:48.253 --> 02:31:54.976]  I know that tyranny and concentration camps and mass murder and god emperors is the norm throughout history.
[02:31:55.036 --> 02:31:56.756]  It's what these lunatics always want.
[02:31:57.057 --> 02:32:00.658]  They never get enough, and I know they're doing that right now, and they want to use
[02:32:01.614 --> 02:32:09.419]  My treasure, my family, my country, to empower this global government that's controlled by these psychopathic elites.
[02:32:09.579 --> 02:32:11.420]  Yeah, I hope we can continue doing it.
[02:32:11.520 --> 02:32:16.643]  I mean, you take a look at what they want to do to the Internet, go to this Internet 2 and corporatize the whole thing.
[02:32:17.539 --> 02:32:21.882]  Hopefully we can keep our sites and we can continue to educate people.
[02:32:22.282 --> 02:32:24.123]  Well, I need to write articles about that, Kurt.
[02:32:24.183 --> 02:32:24.783]  You need to.
[02:32:24.884 --> 02:32:25.824]  Paul Watson needs to.
[02:32:25.844 --> 02:32:27.365]  We all need to expose the Internet, too.
[02:32:27.385 --> 02:32:33.408]  I mean, they openly say they're going to let the old Internet basically shut down and force us onto a new net where there's no free speech.
[02:32:33.469 --> 02:32:34.049]  It's a nightmare!
[02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:34.609]  Yeah.
[02:32:35.009 --> 02:32:37.891]  I mean, they're masters at hijacking entire markets.
[02:32:38.451 --> 02:32:40.792]  And by the way, it's not going to be free market, folks.
[02:32:41.172 --> 02:32:43.273]  These guys are crony capitalists.
[02:32:43.313 --> 02:32:44.494]  They steal markets.
[02:32:45.174 --> 02:32:47.835]  They come in and they set up monopoly deals.
[02:32:48.816 --> 02:32:52.917]  Well, their whole plan to denigrate, you know, us is not really working.
[02:32:52.937 --> 02:33:00.861]  A couple years ago, you had the corporate media, you know, they said, oh, look at these idiot bloggers out there, you know, basically making us out to be idiots.
[02:33:01.425 --> 02:33:07.070]  And I think now that they've realized that the power of the internet in the last couple years, they're coming up with plan B to shut it down.
[02:33:07.270 --> 02:33:13.536]  Well, they're actually panicking, saying, ooh, they are taking over, ooh, we're losing most of our subscribers, ooh, nobody's watching us anymore.
[02:33:13.596 --> 02:33:17.559]  I mean, the last 10 years, major newspapers have lost 60% of their circulation.
[02:33:17.740 --> 02:33:17.920]  Yeah.
[02:33:18.620 --> 02:33:21.721]  And it's not like each one of us is getting all those listeners.
[02:33:21.741 --> 02:33:30.544]  There's millions of people out on the net, and it's all fragmented, which I think is even better, because there isn't one head they can chop off, folks.
[02:33:30.984 --> 02:33:31.684]  So yeah, you're right.
[02:33:31.724 --> 02:33:36.686]  They want to now basically start shutting the net down and taxing it and restricting it and filtering it out.
[02:33:37.086 --> 02:33:41.268]  Already, most libraries, you can't get to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:41.308 --> 02:33:45.469]  Kurt, have you had trouble with finding out about filters, filtering out your site?
[02:33:45.829 --> 02:33:47.350]  I haven't really heard anything about it.
[02:33:47.750 --> 02:33:54.735]  As far as the newspapers go, I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that people just don't read anymore, or they read it on a very limited basis.
[02:33:55.395 --> 02:33:57.656]  They read the, you know, the cooking instructions on their microwave.
[02:33:57.676 --> 02:34:05.661]  Well, they've attributed about half their loss to that, but a lot of it is TV itself is now even losing total viewership in the aggregate to the internet.
[02:34:05.841 --> 02:34:08.483]  Well, maybe people are waking up and realizing this is a bunch of nonsense.
[02:34:09.123 --> 02:34:21.469]  Well, and more than just that, I mean sure, a big part of that are people going and getting alternative news and stuff, but also TV, I've talked to a TV executive high level, just can't compete with all the porn and the wild stuff that's on the internet.
[02:34:22.590 --> 02:34:24.431]  So they're also panicking over that.
[02:34:24.471 --> 02:34:29.514]  You know, the evil they tried to pump out there on us is actually kind of backfiring on them as well at that level.
[02:34:29.954 --> 02:34:31.855]  But you're right, it's a whole cocktail of things.
[02:34:32.655 --> 02:34:37.879]  I know the fastest growing sector in the web is alternative news and blogs, and that's got him afraid.
[02:34:38.500 --> 02:34:41.042]  Jose in Miami, holding like a champion.
[02:34:41.082 --> 02:34:41.642]  Welcome, sir.
[02:34:41.942 --> 02:34:42.623]  Hello, Alex.
[02:34:42.683 --> 02:34:43.704]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:34:43.724 --> 02:34:44.264]  Thank you.
[02:34:44.644 --> 02:34:52.270]  Before I say what I'm about to say, Alex, without giving any details of my background, I'm Cuban-American, and I don't like Bush.
[02:34:53.071 --> 02:34:53.731]  And he's a puppet.
[02:34:54.392 --> 02:34:55.513]  And I bought it libertarian.
[02:34:55.933 --> 02:35:00.496]  The reason why I'm saying this is because most Cuban-Americans here, they like Bush and all that.
[02:35:02.403 --> 02:35:07.607]  We believe there's a group here who believes that both Castro and Chavez are controlled by the globalists.
[02:35:08.508 --> 02:35:11.510]  I've been hearing you talk about Chavez several times, or we've been hearing you.
[02:35:12.418 --> 02:35:16.519]  And we believe that Castro and Chavez both are controlled by the globalists.
[02:35:16.739 --> 02:35:25.562]  Well, I believe Chavez has been buddy-buddy with Castro, but I've said Castro's a dirty, murdered, and pig.
[02:35:25.582 --> 02:35:26.242]  Well, I understand that.
[02:35:26.302 --> 02:35:26.522]  I know.
[02:35:26.542 --> 02:35:26.842]  I know that.
[02:35:26.902 --> 02:35:27.942]  And so I'm no fan of him.
[02:35:27.982 --> 02:35:30.383]  Look, Castro isn't giving the people their land back.
[02:35:30.683 --> 02:35:32.243]  Castro isn't cutting taxes.
[02:35:32.543 --> 02:35:35.104]  Castro doesn't let people protest against him.
[02:35:35.364 --> 02:35:36.204]  Chavez does.
[02:35:36.585 --> 02:35:37.905]  Now, there's a difference now.
[02:35:38.925 --> 02:35:41.026]  Times have changed, and they're doing things differently.
[02:35:43.193 --> 02:35:52.997]  First of all, to go on further, I even believe that the October Missile Crisis, or some of them believe that the October Missile Crisis was staged.
[02:35:53.057 --> 02:35:58.259]  One of the main reasons it was staged was to make sure that Castro remained in power without opposition.
[02:35:58.279 --> 02:36:04.281]  You're saying by putting pressure on him internationally, that made the people rally around him?
[02:36:04.561 --> 02:36:11.484]  Well, Castro, he had a lot of opposition after the revolution.
[02:36:12.128 --> 02:36:14.449]  And, you know, I can go into a whole story about that.
[02:36:14.629 --> 02:36:17.691]  And he has been supported by the CIA.
[02:36:17.731 --> 02:36:18.831]  We know, some of us know that.
[02:36:18.971 --> 02:36:23.873]  And there are even ex-CIA agents here who have evidence that Cashel worked for the CIA.
[02:36:24.213 --> 02:36:27.095]  Well, I mean, Eisenhower called him, what, the Abraham Lincoln?
[02:36:27.115 --> 02:36:27.735]  Mm-hmm.
[02:36:28.495 --> 02:36:35.779]  And they had to guarantee that Cashel stayed in power for several reasons, and I'm pretty sure you're aware of that.
[02:36:37.219 --> 02:36:40.141]  And one of the things they had to do was to stage
[02:36:41.328 --> 02:36:41.568]  I don't
[02:37:04.810 --> 02:37:10.072]  Why would the CIA go after Hugo Chavez, though, if he was one of their puppets?
[02:37:10.393 --> 02:37:22.078]  They're not going to go... You see, both Castro and Chavez, they both supposedly hate the CIA, the World Bank,
[02:37:23.022 --> 02:37:51.350]  uh... and uh... the i'm and i'm not sure i mean i don't have to really doesn't i know he's controlled but i mean as for chavez he just pulled he just pulled ambassadors out he really did kill the fda for the next few years i mean he really is opposing that he really is shooting that down okay here's where they're doing i don't know if you're aware that there are hundreds of human agents now in cuba holding of doctors and uh... they're pulling of doctors and uh... they're training venezuelan uh...
[02:37:51.815 --> 02:37:54.416]  How to oppress their people there and do what they have to do.
[02:37:54.676 --> 02:37:59.197]  And I can give you, if you like, I can give you plenty of evidence about that.
[02:37:59.737 --> 02:38:01.057]  Well, you know what I want you to do, sir?
[02:38:01.618 --> 02:38:04.778]  Can you get me some information at tipsandinfoawards.com?
[02:38:04.818 --> 02:38:06.059]  Give me some people to interview.
[02:38:06.079 --> 02:38:09.019]  Because I think the jury is out on Chavez.
[02:38:09.119 --> 02:38:11.400]  I really think he's fallen out of favor with them.
[02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:14.541]  I know that he's done a lot of things that I agree with.
[02:38:14.581 --> 02:38:15.781]  He's made the globalists mad.
[02:38:16.281 --> 02:38:18.742]  But I do find it suspicious that they kidnapped him
[02:38:19.657 --> 02:38:25.380]  And then didn't kill him or didn't exile him, but they did have him on that helicopter and that his troops were able to take back over.
[02:38:25.740 --> 02:38:27.161]  Those stuff like that has happened before.
[02:38:27.201 --> 02:38:36.125]  I don't entirely trust Chavez, but I mean he just keeps doing the right things over and over again, and I don't really see him lavishing praise on Fidel Castro.
[02:38:36.185 --> 02:38:37.945]  I can't stand Fidel Castro.
[02:38:38.386 --> 02:38:40.327]  I know, I know, I know you can't stand Fidel Castro.
[02:38:40.687 --> 02:38:47.450]  I think you have to see some of the things that we see here in Miami, like the videos, Cuban television and Venezuelan television,
[02:38:48.109 --> 02:38:50.171]  What's really going on in Venezuela?
[02:38:50.731 --> 02:38:56.396]  Now, why I think that they're doing this, I think Castro doesn't have much time left in power.
[02:38:56.436 --> 02:39:00.139]  You know, he's old already, and they already exhausted Cuba.
[02:39:00.399 --> 02:39:01.800]  So they're passing the baton?
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:04.302]  Yes, they're passing the baton, but in a different way.
[02:39:04.322 --> 02:39:08.705]  They're not doing it in the same way, the same old-fashioned communist way.
[02:39:09.206 --> 02:39:17.212]  What they want to do is they want to establish socialist government in South and Central America by using Hugo Chavez, helping them.
[02:39:17.938 --> 02:39:21.220]  And then, finally, they're going to merge with the U.S.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:24.222]  Well, of course, that is the plan.
[02:39:24.622 --> 02:39:25.202]  Right, exactly.
[02:39:25.222 --> 02:39:26.703]  But they're doing it in a different way.
[02:39:26.743 --> 02:39:32.326]  They're doing it in a way where it's not so obvious as with a communist, you know, with Castro.
[02:39:32.406 --> 02:39:38.750]  Well, look, I agree that the left has got just another path to the New World Order, just like the supposed right-wing does.
[02:39:39.330 --> 02:39:41.311]  And that's why we've got a short circuit there.
[02:39:41.351 --> 02:39:43.012]  But I'm looking at Chavez.
[02:39:43.052 --> 02:39:45.474]  Look, if he's a real populist, they're going to kill him soon.
[02:39:46.154 --> 02:39:48.598]  Or there's going to be a big attempt, or he's going to be wounded.
[02:39:49.278 --> 02:39:52.603]  But, you know, we just caught the Taiwanese president in a fake wounding.
[02:39:52.883 --> 02:39:55.506]  You never know what's real, but time will tell.
[02:39:55.847 --> 02:39:56.608]  Send me some info.
[02:39:56.628 --> 02:39:57.449]  We're just out of time.
[02:39:57.489 --> 02:40:03.677]  I appreciate you holding, Jose, and you're welcome to call back tomorrow, earlier in the show, when I don't have a guest on, so we can talk more about it.
[02:40:04.557 --> 02:40:08.500]  Believe me, I don't trust Hugo Chavez as far as I can throw him.
[02:40:09.140 --> 02:40:13.023]  But, I mean, he really is, he really did screw up the FDAA.
[02:40:13.043 --> 02:40:14.164]  I mean, they had the deal ready.
[02:40:14.464 --> 02:40:15.545]  Why would they screw that up?
[02:40:15.605 --> 02:40:17.546]  I mean, it's at so many levels.
[02:40:17.986 --> 02:40:20.548]  I don't think the globalists are omnipresent and control everything.
[02:40:20.568 --> 02:40:24.091]  There have been a whole bunch of governments they've had to overthrow down in Latin America.
[02:40:25.712 --> 02:40:30.395]  Let's go ahead and real fast, Eric in Connecticut, you're on the air with Kurt Newmo, go ahead.
[02:40:31.056 --> 02:40:32.917]  Hey Alex, welcome from the Skull and Bones country.
[02:40:33.570 --> 02:40:33.990]  That's right.
[02:40:34.050 --> 02:40:35.151]  Welcome.
[02:40:35.632 --> 02:40:36.733]  Yeah, Kurt, great job.
[02:40:37.093 --> 02:40:39.855]  And good to hear a good show as usual, Alex.
[02:40:40.336 --> 02:40:43.698]  You know, critical thought and radical dissent against authority created this nation.
[02:40:43.778 --> 02:40:44.699]  Conformity did not.
[02:40:45.440 --> 02:40:48.082]  And I think more and more people are realizing that.
[02:40:48.262 --> 02:40:55.969]  Before I went into my quick main point, I wanted to mention Greg Simansky had a gentleman on who worked at the World Trade Center, and he's gone from a 225-pound strapping rock
[02:40:58.531 --> 02:41:01.592]  125 pound cancer riddled skeleton.
[02:41:01.972 --> 02:41:02.853]  Which individual is that?
[02:41:02.873 --> 02:41:05.834]  I've interviewed quite a few of the janitors and people.
[02:41:06.054 --> 02:41:09.195]  I can't remember his name, but it was on his website.
[02:41:09.215 --> 02:41:10.595]  Well, you know what I'll do?
[02:41:10.676 --> 02:41:11.696]  I'll check it out, sir.
[02:41:12.056 --> 02:41:13.417]  Okay, and one last thing, Alex.
[02:41:13.477 --> 02:41:15.397]  I wanted to mention Codex Magicka.
[02:41:15.717 --> 02:41:18.018]  I ordered it, I have it, and it's a great book.
[02:41:18.698 --> 02:41:22.920]  Somebody earlier mentioned, if you want to really know what the secret government's up to, who they are,
[02:41:24.185 --> 02:41:29.230]  Mr. Mars did a wonderful job, and I commend you for offering this book for sale, Alex.
[02:41:29.250 --> 02:41:30.571]  It's a great book.
[02:41:30.651 --> 02:41:31.652]  It names names.
[02:41:31.812 --> 02:41:32.773]  It gives places.
[02:41:32.874 --> 02:41:34.035]  It's got a ton of pictures.
[02:41:34.055 --> 02:41:42.163]  620-something pages long, and it is... It's a one-stop compendium of what you need to know about the New World Order.
[02:41:42.243 --> 02:41:42.824]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:41:43.024 --> 02:41:44.205]  Thank you so much for the call.
[02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:47.641]  Kurt, I know you research things.
[02:41:47.661 --> 02:41:51.183]  Do you run into the occult like we do every time you kick down another door?
[02:41:51.483 --> 02:41:52.563]  You just find the occult?
[02:41:52.623 --> 02:41:58.286]  I mean, everybody knows that Reagan ran every decision he made off of an astrologer, but it gets a lot deeper than that.
[02:41:58.786 --> 02:41:59.567]  Have you run into that?
[02:42:00.107 --> 02:42:01.048]  Yeah, I've run into it.
[02:42:01.468 --> 02:42:11.353]  I have a tendency, though, more than to look at the occult than to look at the situation, the relationships between the power brokers and how they run stuff politically.
[02:42:12.605 --> 02:42:20.105]  You know it's important what they believe obviously it affects their philosophy and the occult is part of that but it doesn't seem to
[02:42:21.380 --> 02:42:27.463]  I don't seem to concentrate on that as much as the other... Well, I think it goes to what type of lunatics they are, but I agree with you.
[02:42:27.883 --> 02:42:42.851]  I mean, I think overall, sticking to just the openly evil things they're doing is of a paramount importance, and then it's kind of an entree or derv, or maybe after dinner snack, all of the occultism.
[02:42:43.051 --> 02:42:47.733]  But it really does drive them, and at the end of the day, we do learn that it's a spiritual battle.
[02:42:48.234 --> 02:42:51.135]  KurtNemo.com, I want to get you back on, my friend.
[02:42:52.156 --> 02:43:01.404]  You know, Alex, I hope that last caller wasn't referencing William Rodriguez when he was talking about the guy with cancer at the World Trade Center.
[02:43:01.464 --> 02:43:07.630]  He was talking about somebody that had information about the event at the World Trade Center that is dying from cancer.
[02:43:07.670 --> 02:43:08.451]  Is that what he was saying?
[02:43:08.491 --> 02:43:09.471]  Yeah, he didn't know.
[02:43:10.132 --> 02:43:13.155]  One of those special two-day, two-week cancers everybody seems to get.
[02:43:13.675 --> 02:43:15.657]  But I'll look into it and try to find out.
[02:43:17.438 --> 02:43:19.299]  All right, thank you for coming on with us, my friend.
[02:43:19.379 --> 02:43:19.680]  All right.
[02:43:20.080 --> 02:43:20.460]  Take care.
[02:43:20.480 --> 02:43:25.383]  I'm going to try to get to a few final calls in the final segment here.
[02:43:26.484 --> 02:43:28.125]  We're kind of doing two things here.
[02:43:28.145 --> 02:43:33.108]  A good friend of mine, Jack Brownrigg, died Sunday morning at about 5.30, 5 a.m.
[02:43:35.635 --> 02:43:38.296]  And that's who you, years ago, would hear here on the show.
[02:43:38.816 --> 02:43:43.617]  But about two, three years ago, he had a lung taken out, so we couldn't have him on the show a lot, because he had trouble coughing.
[02:43:43.637 --> 02:43:45.138]  He still worked at Miner's Resources.
[02:43:45.638 --> 02:43:51.440]  Until just a few months ago, he caught a final ad for the Red Book, the book of coins for 2006.
[02:43:53.712 --> 02:44:02.762]  Kind of makes me sad every time I hear Jack's voice, but he was a really sweet, nice fellow and been with Midas Resources for the decade plus it's been here.
[02:44:03.362 --> 02:44:05.845]  I know it's been sad for Ted because they were good personal friends.
[02:44:06.165 --> 02:44:15.015]  That's not really why Ted's on for the next few minutes, but I thought I'd also just bring up Jack and see if you, just spring this on you, see if you had any comments about Jack Brownrig, Ted.
[02:44:15.945 --> 02:44:18.927]  Well, now you're going to bring me to tears, too, Alex.
[02:44:18.967 --> 02:44:20.829]  Jack has been just a great friend.
[02:44:20.869 --> 02:44:26.092]  He was the first person that I called on to ask if he'd want to work for me when I opened up Midas Resources Incorporated.
[02:44:26.152 --> 02:44:30.495]  Just a great grandfather and a wonderful father.
[02:44:30.515 --> 02:44:33.297]  He did have lung cancer.
[02:44:33.337 --> 02:44:35.359]  He quit smoking years ago, but it still got him.
[02:44:36.938 --> 02:44:39.719]  I've got to tell you, there's a lot of sadness around here about Jack.
[02:44:39.759 --> 02:44:45.501]  He's been one wonderful driving force for both Genesis and Midas Resources.
[02:44:47.222 --> 02:44:53.864]  A lot of those commercials you hear for Midas Resources, you hear that coin drop and, hi, this is Jack Brownrigg, that's him.
[02:44:53.984 --> 02:44:59.086]  Sad, sad time and I wish his family well and most certainly am going to miss him.
[02:44:59.807 --> 02:45:00.487]  Absolutely.
[02:45:01.307 --> 02:45:03.568]  Ted, I had you on a week ago.
[02:45:04.665 --> 02:45:05.466]  Gold has now hit $500.
[02:45:05.666 --> 02:45:10.831]  It's gone up, I guess, $15 or more since we had you on.
[02:45:11.211 --> 02:45:11.932]  It's now going up to $500.
[02:45:12.512 --> 02:45:17.197]  Big banks, big richy-rich crowd is now moving into gold big time.
[02:45:17.257 --> 02:45:18.378]  The dollar is in trouble.
[02:45:18.398 --> 02:45:20.300]  The EU's currency is even wobbling.
[02:45:21.080 --> 02:45:22.742]  In uncertain times, gold only goes up.
[02:45:22.822 --> 02:45:24.163]  I bought some more gold last week.
[02:45:24.563 --> 02:45:34.131]  You're offering some coins right now that you're almost out of, and you're offering them at the price you've been offering them for two weeks, so that price is locked in, but for not much longer.
[02:45:34.191 --> 02:45:36.973]  So get a really good price on these coins.
[02:45:37.013 --> 02:45:37.794]  Tell us about them, Ted.
[02:45:37.854 --> 02:45:40.876]  Well, yeah, this is the $5 gold pieces.
[02:45:40.916 --> 02:45:41.717]  They're $1.75.
[02:45:42.057 --> 02:45:46.401]  We did make this offer on air just a week ago, and actually it was the same price that it was
[02:45:46.901 --> 02:45:49.923]  A week before that, gold has gone up 30 bucks since then, Alex.
[02:45:49.964 --> 02:45:50.584]  It really has.
[02:45:50.744 --> 02:45:51.465]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:45:51.485 --> 02:45:52.045]  30, not 15.
[02:45:52.265 --> 02:45:52.726]  Yep.
[02:45:52.866 --> 02:45:54.267]  Actually, yeah.
[02:45:54.287 --> 02:45:54.267]  $30.
[02:45:54.307 --> 02:45:58.230]  And like you said, we're hovering around that $500 level right now.
[02:45:58.290 --> 02:45:59.191]  The spot gold is at $493.70.
[02:46:01.777 --> 02:46:03.538]  Talking about a win-win situation.
[02:46:03.578 --> 02:46:05.759]  I mean, you want to support the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:05.799 --> 02:46:11.921]  When you buy these, the profits go directly to the Alex Jones Show and supports this particular broadcast.
[02:46:11.961 --> 02:46:19.684]  But they are at $175, which puts them, I think the number is $3,500 per roll at $20, or you can pick them up one at a time.
[02:46:20.164 --> 02:46:24.106]  It's a perfect time to be getting involved on this, and there's no way that the price is going to hold.
[02:46:24.226 --> 02:46:26.207]  So you're getting a collector coin.
[02:46:26.807 --> 02:46:30.510]  That doesn't have to be registered and the sale isn't tracked and it's non-compensatable.
[02:46:30.850 --> 02:46:33.052]  Bullion is at near bullion prices.
[02:46:33.493 --> 02:46:37.135]  That's exactly what it is Alex and it's a small piece of gold that you can use as money.
[02:46:37.176 --> 02:46:43.841]  You can turn around and use this thing in the United States as money or anywhere across the world and we know what's going on here.
[02:46:44.241 --> 02:46:45.762]  We had a meeting today.
[02:46:45.802 --> 02:46:47.083]  There were two reports that I had.
[02:46:47.184 --> 02:46:51.167]  One that went across talking about the real estate bubble and if you have a house
[02:46:51.807 --> 02:46:59.374]  Or if you have real estate rental properties or anything like that, you better read this report by Obbie Balton because it's just amazing.
[02:46:59.454 --> 02:47:00.815]  Can you give that to people to call?
[02:47:01.015 --> 02:47:02.016]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:47:02.356 --> 02:47:04.038]  That is a must read.
[02:47:04.098 --> 02:47:06.160]  Well here's the headline out of the Associated Press.
[02:47:06.200 --> 02:47:12.345]  Gold prices approach 18-year high of $500 and it says that it's set to go even higher.
[02:47:12.645 --> 02:47:14.267]  Folks, seriously, go to
[02:47:15.328 --> 02:47:16.088]  Yes, sir.
[02:47:31.463 --> 02:47:33.924]  Every few months, I take a little bit of money and buy a few coins.
[02:47:34.324 --> 02:47:38.125]  Over the years, I've built that up to something moderate as an insurance policy.
[02:47:38.345 --> 02:47:43.006]  And the little bit of money I got in the bank, it's been devalued by 45% in the last three years.
[02:47:43.066 --> 02:47:47.827]  So my gold has exploded in price, almost doubling, since I first started buying gold.
[02:47:48.287 --> 02:47:50.968]  And my cash money has dwindled.
[02:47:51.468 --> 02:47:54.008]  And when that real estate bubble goes, it's going to be devastating.
[02:47:54.288 --> 02:47:57.529]  It's really smart to move into gold right now and tell them it's the Alex Jones Special.
[02:47:57.789 --> 02:48:00.630]  Then that goes to the Genesis Network that supports all the radio shows.
[02:48:01.611 --> 02:48:03.993]  And it's just so important to do this.
[02:48:04.013 --> 02:48:05.054]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:05.074 --> 02:48:06.475]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:06.775 --> 02:48:07.055]  Ted?
[02:48:07.075 --> 02:48:19.366]  Yeah, hey, say Alex, I just, once again, I want to thank you for bringing up Jack, and really it is a great time to get into the precious metals, and you won't find a better buy than this one.
[02:48:19.386 --> 02:48:20.687]  This is really spectacular.
[02:48:21.227 --> 02:48:24.690]  So this is the prices from two weeks ago at today's gold prices.
[02:48:24.870 --> 02:48:25.511]  Yep, that's right.
[02:48:25.531 --> 02:48:27.752]  Because you've already made the buy.
[02:48:29.173 --> 02:48:29.454]  Yep.
[02:48:29.474 --> 02:48:29.554]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:48:29.574 --> 02:48:30.094]  Give us a call.
[02:48:30.114 --> 02:48:30.795]  We'll get you set up.
[02:48:31.495 --> 02:48:32.436]  Absolutely, folks.
[02:48:32.676 --> 02:48:38.821]  It feels good promoting you, the listener, cashing in some of those paper notes for actual gold.
[02:48:39.739 --> 02:48:42.480]  It's been the first money we used for 6,000 years.
[02:48:42.500 --> 02:48:49.164]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.

[02:51:51.966 --> 02:51:54.747]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:55.948 --> 02:51:57.949]  Crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:51:57.989 --> 02:52:00.610]  You know, I look at the news I didn't cover today and I kick myself.
[02:52:00.630 --> 02:52:02.290]  I'm going to try to cover it right now.
[02:52:03.031 --> 02:52:05.172]  Sorry we didn't play that at MSNBC club.
[02:52:05.192 --> 02:52:06.272]  We just ran out of time.
[02:52:06.972 --> 02:52:08.133]  Try to play that for you tomorrow.
[02:52:08.553 --> 02:52:14.996]  With Professor Jones being grilled by one of the little tycoons there, Tucker Twitt Carlson.
[02:52:16.585 --> 02:52:21.989]  But, you know, I think about Dr. Wolf, who runs some stations I've been on for years up in upstate New York.
[02:52:23.110 --> 02:52:27.593]  One week talking to him, funny old guy, smart old guy, always making jokes, pastor.
[02:52:29.314 --> 02:52:30.995]  And next you get a call, he's dead.
[02:52:32.256 --> 02:52:34.598]  Just, oh, he'd had cancer, he'd been quiet about it, he died.
[02:52:35.378 --> 02:52:36.559]  He was a real sweetheart.
[02:52:37.060 --> 02:52:40.782]  These people you expect to be there forever, you're used to talking to and knowing and liking.
[02:52:41.743 --> 02:52:42.243]  Just gone.
[02:52:42.303 --> 02:52:44.185]  And I knew Jack Brownrigg a lot better than I knew
[02:52:45.706 --> 02:52:46.646]  Dr. David Wolf.
[02:52:47.987 --> 02:52:54.850]  Jack is a really sweet person and I knew he was getting ready to go here just six months ago when I saw him up there.
[02:52:54.870 --> 02:52:55.611]  He didn't look good.
[02:52:55.631 --> 02:52:56.911]  He was still up there working at Midas.
[02:52:57.551 --> 02:52:58.212]  Liked to work.
[02:52:58.272 --> 02:52:58.932]  Sweet guy.
[02:52:59.452 --> 02:53:00.933]  Always a big smile on his face.
[02:53:00.953 --> 02:53:01.373]  He's gone.
[02:53:01.934 --> 02:53:04.695]  Losing the old ones, you know, it's just sad to see them go.
[02:53:04.715 --> 02:53:09.277]  We need to respect our elders and we need to appreciate them.
[02:53:10.226 --> 02:53:12.408]  And it's just life is so short.
[02:53:13.529 --> 02:53:14.890]  I know I've been talking a lot about that lately.
[02:53:14.910 --> 02:53:17.012]  I just am so appreciative of life.
[02:53:17.172 --> 02:53:20.114]  I enjoy every moment of my life, even when I'm sick or don't feel good.
[02:53:21.095 --> 02:53:22.316]  I just can't stand the globalists.
[02:53:22.336 --> 02:53:27.240]  They're so sick and they're such a disease and they are hurting so many good people.
[02:53:28.212 --> 02:53:31.735]  And believe me, we've done our research, we've done our homework for people that are listening out there.
[02:53:31.995 --> 02:53:34.217]  Please check out our claims, but I know a lot of you won't.
[02:53:34.497 --> 02:53:37.059]  Just listen to me, and you know in your gut, we're in trouble.
[02:53:37.119 --> 02:53:39.481]  Our society is, and you better stand up and get involved.
[02:53:39.741 --> 02:53:42.784]  Doesn't matter if you can't fix all the problems in the world, or you don't have all the answers.
[02:53:43.084 --> 02:53:45.346]  Just getting involved is what it's all about, and caring.
[02:53:45.866 --> 02:53:47.768]  And stop being so naive out there.
[02:53:48.688 --> 02:53:49.389]  Look at this article.
[02:53:49.689 --> 02:53:51.431]  Report, Cheney advocated U.S.
[02:53:51.471 --> 02:53:51.771]  torture.
[02:53:52.427 --> 02:53:53.548]  United Press International.
[02:53:53.568 --> 02:53:53.908]  The U.S.
[02:53:53.948 --> 02:53:58.112]  practice of using torture on terror detainees was rooted in Vice President Dick Cheney's office.
[02:53:58.512 --> 02:54:01.174]  A former senior State Department official claims retired U.S.
[02:54:01.214 --> 02:54:09.942]  Army Colonel Larry Wilkerson, who serves as former Secretary of State, Colin Powell's Chief of Staff, made the allegation on CNN and said it was possible the practice was still going on.
[02:54:10.782 --> 02:54:13.004]  And he went on to say that he was there.
[02:54:13.044 --> 02:54:14.185]  The orders came from Cheney.
[02:54:16.087 --> 02:54:17.488]  Funny, we got those reports about it.
[02:54:17.548 --> 02:54:18.789]  Cheney likes to get rough.
[02:54:18.889 --> 02:54:20.070]  He's really into it.
[02:54:21.596 --> 02:54:22.637]  He does like women, though.
[02:54:22.677 --> 02:54:24.258]  He's not like most of the people in the White House.
[02:54:24.298 --> 02:54:30.922]  He likes, according to sources that have been confirmed, he likes to knock women's teeth out and do other things we can't mention here.
[02:54:31.823 --> 02:54:40.109]  But here he is in the real world, and it's now coming out, the orders we're given to take all those photos and all those snapshots for somebody's personal enjoyment.
[02:54:40.629 --> 02:54:44.832]  I expect to see that in the next few weeks or months in the news, unless they carry out another terror attack.
[02:54:45.552 --> 02:54:45.993]  But you know what?
[02:54:46.013 --> 02:54:50.576]  They'll probably just put it in the news that Cheney likes to look at the pictures, and it'll just be, well, you know, that's Christian!
[02:54:51.405 --> 02:54:53.066]  That's as Christian as El Diablo!
[02:54:53.926 --> 02:54:55.446]  But that's one of the articles here.
[02:54:56.587 --> 02:54:59.668]  And CIA, unique methods, not called torture.
[02:54:59.728 --> 02:55:04.530]  Old Porter Goss, it turns out, was a sitting CIA officer the entire time he was in Congress.
[02:55:04.910 --> 02:55:06.710]  An operative in Congress, totally criminal.
[02:55:07.631 --> 02:55:09.571]  Now our CIA director says, it's not torture.
[02:55:10.051 --> 02:55:11.872]  We don't call it torture, we call it pressure.
[02:55:11.912 --> 02:55:14.653]  So a reiteration of the Gonzales Memorandum.
[02:55:15.453 --> 02:55:17.334]  The Gonzales Policy.
[02:55:18.220 --> 02:55:22.861]  And don't worry that we have exiled Iranians, says Nation Hides Materials for Nook's AP.
[02:55:22.881 --> 02:55:23.501]  There's the proof!
[02:55:23.521 --> 02:55:24.562]  We've got more shills.
[02:55:24.582 --> 02:55:30.603]  I'm surprised they're not using, you know, Chalabi again to tell us about how serious it all is.
[02:55:30.823 --> 02:55:36.684]  And then Madonna comes out and people hail her as exposing government involvement in 9-11.
[02:55:37.385 --> 02:55:41.566]  What she said is, is, I don't think you can even prove what Michael Moore claims.
[02:55:41.586 --> 02:55:45.267]  Well, Michael Moore does a big whitewash, and she's not even as hardcore as that.
[02:55:45.307 --> 02:55:47.027]  She's not even pap or milquetoast.
[02:55:48.178 --> 02:55:50.460]  So, uh, I don't know what people are hailing that for.
[02:55:50.480 --> 02:55:57.667]  I'm not trying to criticize people, but I think we're looking for silver linings that aren't there in some cases, all overlooking the sun itself.
[02:55:58.348 --> 02:56:00.790]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, back to 9 to Midnight Central.
[02:56:00.810 --> 02:56:02.512]  I only plug my videos in the first hour.
[02:56:02.532 --> 02:56:05.695]  Now, we need to lavish, uh, lavish those.
[02:56:05.715 --> 02:56:06.836]  I mean, Christmas is coming up.
[02:56:06.876 --> 02:56:07.577]  They're great gifts.
