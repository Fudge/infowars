[00:00:05.813 --> 00:00:06.473]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.194]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:09.994]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.655 --> 00:00:11.475]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.235 --> 00:00:13.196]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.796 --> 00:00:17.417]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.977 --> 00:00:22.079]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:43.553]  All right, my friends, it's the 31st day of January 2005.
[00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:49.236]  Last day of the first month of 05.
[00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:51.417]  Already a month has sped past us.
[00:00:52.818 --> 00:00:53.818]  And I'm Alex Jones.
[00:00:53.858 --> 00:00:56.219]  Your host will be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:03.503]  I want to give you a chance to respond to the so-called election in Iraq.
[00:01:06.443 --> 00:01:12.728]  Yesterday I heard a former Reagan administration official on the radio talking about how it is not a real election.
[00:01:13.849 --> 00:01:19.413]  How there are hundreds of people who are already pre-appointed who are running unopposed.
[00:01:20.654 --> 00:01:26.078]  But our news continues to call it a free and open election.
[00:01:26.138 --> 00:01:33.123]  But I was shocked to hear a former Reagan administration official on the air saying it's fake.
[00:01:33.523 --> 00:01:34.464]  Because it is!
[00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:49.295]  It's totally staged, and bigger than just the story of the staged election in Iraq is how our media can continue to put out the lie that it is an election.
[00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:57.121]  Well, now the war must be okay because the war was about having elections in Iraq.
[00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.564]  They never said the war was about elections in Iraq.
[00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:03.086]  It was about WMDs.
[00:02:04.287 --> 00:02:05.568]  But when those weren't found,
[00:02:06.405 --> 00:02:09.706]  They just turned it around and said, no, we're here to bring them freedom.
[00:02:09.746 --> 00:02:10.926]  That's what it was always about.
[00:02:11.306 --> 00:02:16.207]  It's an urban legend that we were here for weapons of mass destruction.
[00:02:18.527 --> 00:02:20.107]  That's a quote, by the way, by Rumsfeld.
[00:02:20.427 --> 00:02:22.308]  We went there to bring them elections.
[00:02:23.368 --> 00:02:27.109]  That's why we went and they said, but excuse us, you said it was about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:27.949]  No, I didn't.
[00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:28.969]  That's an urban legend.
[00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:31.930]  And you need to stop telling that lie!
[00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:34.590]  And so I'm a liberal.
[00:02:36.221 --> 00:02:37.161]  I'm a communist.
[00:02:37.742 --> 00:02:44.685]  If I don't say that Rumsfeld never said it was about weapons of mass destruction, that's now the mantra.
[00:02:46.345 --> 00:02:57.910]  Does it matter if I was on probably a hundred radio talk shows debating neocons in the six months leading up to the war and then during the war when they didn't find the weapons of mass destruction in the last two years?
[00:02:59.671 --> 00:03:02.232]  Did it matter if they'd been all over TV promoting it?
[00:03:02.372 --> 00:03:03.852]  It never happened.
[00:03:03.912 --> 00:03:05.093]  They never said it.
[00:03:06.494 --> 00:03:08.656]  And if you're against open borders, you're a liberal.
[00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:11.357]  And if you're against gun control, you're a liberal.
[00:03:12.098 --> 00:03:16.161]  And if you're against the free trade area of the Americas and the end of our sovereignty, you're a liberal.
[00:03:17.582 --> 00:03:22.305]  Well, then I guess I'm a liberal, and Joseph Stalin is a conservative.
[00:03:25.387 --> 00:03:29.169]  I want to go over the 14 defining characteristics of fascism.
[00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:32.151]  We covered this about a year ago, but now
[00:03:33.718 --> 00:03:51.723]  A flash animation, we have the audio of, it's being posted on InfoWars.com, the video, tells it like it is, but also with an underlying false left propaganda seed.
[00:03:52.763 --> 00:03:58.665]  So I want to try to analyze that a little bit, and of course, as I said, go over to the election and take your calls.
[00:03:59.927 --> 00:04:01.628]  And there's just so much other news.
[00:04:02.228 --> 00:04:13.253]  As if the national ID card legislation passed last month wasn't enough, now they've got more national ID card legislation to even make it worse, if that's possible.
[00:04:15.073 --> 00:04:17.714]  And just so much happening, so much going on.
[00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:18.955]  I trust you had a great weekend.
[00:04:19.435 --> 00:04:21.736]  I actually got 8 hours sleep last night.
[00:04:22.677 --> 00:04:23.897]  And I hadn't had in months.
[00:04:23.997 --> 00:04:25.938]  And I feel so good.
[00:04:27.105 --> 00:04:28.445]  Went to bed about 1 o'clock.
[00:04:29.126 --> 00:04:32.887]  Slept late until 9 o'clock this morning.
[00:04:34.567 --> 00:04:37.068]  And I feel like I've been rewarded or something.
[00:04:37.108 --> 00:04:39.969]  Like I've died and gone to heaven.
[00:04:40.589 --> 00:04:43.190]  I may have to start repeating this 8 hour sleep thing.
[00:04:44.887 --> 00:04:47.188]  I think they got it figured out when they say you need eight hours.
[00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.411]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.net.
[00:04:53.732 --> 00:04:56.173]  They're all freshly updated for you with a lot of new stuff.
[00:04:56.593 --> 00:04:57.354]  So check them out.
[00:04:57.374 --> 00:04:58.054]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.408 --> 00:05:02.929]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.109 --> 00:05:06.190]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:10.232]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.272 --> 00:05:14.513]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:05:14.854 --> 00:05:18.635]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:20.576]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:21.176 --> 00:05:24.080]  Riot police attack people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.825]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:32.049]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:35.072]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.573 --> 00:05:41.700]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.002]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.402 --> 00:05:47.763]  Order your video today.

[00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:01.590]  Terrorism!
[00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:02.490]  Terrorism!
[00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:08.675]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[00:06:08.915 --> 00:06:10.497]  Alarming words for our time!
[00:06:10.757 --> 00:06:13.239]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:28.190]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:28.550]  government.

[00:07:00.091 --> 00:07:03.474]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:07:03.714 --> 00:07:04.034]  Why?
[00:07:04.054 --> 00:07:06.996]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[00:08:11.623 --> 00:08:20.249]  We're going to have wide open tones your chance to talk about the staged election and there's no other way to describe it over in Iraq.
[00:08:21.986 --> 00:08:24.727]  Total free number to join us on air, 1-800-25599-231.
[00:08:24.747 --> 00:08:31.631]  Coming up in the next hour, we'll talk about radio frequency identification devices.
[00:08:32.435 --> 00:08:41.822]  And three new big developments, two of which will be broken here for the first time by Catherine Albrecht, who's an expert on this development.
[00:08:41.842 --> 00:08:52.051]  These are the tiny chips that are going into everything that will track and trace every purchase, every sale we make, everything we do as a society.
[00:08:53.412 --> 00:08:55.874]  But I want to get into this election in Iraq.
[00:08:56.254 --> 00:08:58.315]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-255-99231.
[00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:08.253]  And again, folks, there was not an election in Iraq yesterday.
[00:09:08.653 --> 00:09:12.716]  And if you're tuning in for the first time, you're going, oh, this is some liberal I'm listening to.
[00:09:14.056 --> 00:09:15.597]  I don't believe in left and right.
[00:09:15.757 --> 00:09:18.219]  That is, when we talk about real political issues.
[00:09:18.859 --> 00:09:20.660]  It's a diversion, it's a distraction.
[00:09:21.621 --> 00:09:27.705]  The Democrats in this country are voting more often with Bush than the Republican Party itself is.
[00:09:28.165 --> 00:09:29.786]  Just thought I'd cue you in on that.
[00:09:30.911 --> 00:09:32.072]  They love the war.
[00:09:32.172 --> 00:09:33.454]  They love the gun grabbing.
[00:09:33.494 --> 00:09:34.775]  They love the open borders.
[00:09:35.155 --> 00:09:38.438]  They love the NAFTA and the GAD and the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:09:38.899 --> 00:09:40.600]  They love the national ID cards.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:44.684]  They love the faith-based initiative to take over the churches with federal funds.
[00:09:44.924 --> 00:09:46.066]  Hillary's out promoting it.
[00:09:46.106 --> 00:09:46.806]  Praising Bush.
[00:09:47.507 --> 00:09:50.770]  They love the forced psychological testing of all American school children.
[00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.091]  New Freedom Initiative.
[00:09:53.473 --> 00:09:55.735]  But what the Neocon talk show hosts do
[00:09:56.607 --> 00:09:58.989]  The liberals, as you call them, figured out how to take over.
[00:09:59.409 --> 00:10:06.555]  They just pose as conservatives, and you buy any amount of poison, they schlep, or they push on you.
[00:10:07.756 --> 00:10:16.463]  Any amount of societal toxin, as long as it's coated in a nice, phony conservative sugar pill.
[00:10:17.624 --> 00:10:21.387]  There's 300 plus regional governors, they were all appointed a year and a half ago,
[00:10:22.418 --> 00:10:24.580]  Almost every one of them ran unopposed.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:29.605]  The government admitted that no one was allowed to know who was running against them until election day.
[00:10:30.005 --> 00:10:31.526]  The polling places were secret.
[00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:32.447]  This is all admitted!
[00:10:34.649 --> 00:10:40.815]  And Bush comes out and says, well, we'll leave if they ask us to leave, but they know good and well the appointed puppets
[00:10:42.597 --> 00:11:12.112]  that were re-elected resoundingly except for a few stage poster childs uh... yesterday well look some opposition got in here and there in this backwater town where we allowed them to as a token they know exactly what they're doing and so the new appointed puppets who were then elected to the stage of the election say oh stay forever here now we're elected now we want you to take all the oil oh boy
[00:11:13.886 --> 00:11:14.587]  It's staged!
[00:11:14.727 --> 00:11:15.487]  It is staged!
[00:11:15.527 --> 00:11:22.432]  And I hear the neocons all over talk radio saying, if you say it's staged, you're an evil liberal that wants George Bush to fail!
[00:11:24.753 --> 00:11:38.081]  Well, having the same puppets that were appointed now be elected in this staged election isn't going to stop the violence, isn't going to stop our troops getting killed, isn't going to stop the roadside bombs, isn't going to stop any of it!
[00:11:38.101 --> 00:11:40.283]  Isn't going to stop the hemorrhaging of funds
[00:11:41.170 --> 00:11:46.313]  What, $200 billion a year now, the cost of the Iraq War and the occupation.
[00:11:49.174 --> 00:11:55.577]  And the Democrats, you know, the leaders of the Democrats, the Liebermans and the Hillaries of the world are all for this war.
[00:11:56.618 --> 00:12:01.460]  So it isn't some left-right situation as they try to make it.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:05.562]  Bush calls election a resounding success
[00:12:06.237 --> 00:12:11.200]  The President views it as a validation of his agenda to spread democracy!
[00:12:12.842 --> 00:12:23.409]  Kind of like our government spread freedom, installing Saddam in 1979, or telling him to invade Iran and giving him tens of billions, or telling him, I'll go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[00:12:23.449 --> 00:12:28.913]  Yes, we're allies with you, April Gillespie told him in 1990, six days before he invaded.
[00:12:30.891 --> 00:12:34.792]  We're supposed to forget about all this, and then we go, oh, look at the UN, they're evil!
[00:12:35.253 --> 00:12:38.314]  Hopping out in the sun, stealing oil money, and yes he is!
[00:12:39.274 --> 00:12:40.554]  And so is Halliburton!
[00:12:41.815 --> 00:12:45.536]  So the Liberals point at Halliburton, and go, oh, you're evil, Conservatives!
[00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:49.077]  And the Conservatives point at the UN stealing, and go, Liberals, you're evil!
[00:12:49.598 --> 00:12:56.120]  And then each side can only see the corruption of the other side, and can't get above it, and see that it's all the same team!
[00:12:59.477 --> 00:13:04.641]  It's so frustrating to hear this debated.
[00:13:06.922 --> 00:13:19.191]  President Bush on Sunday hailed Iraq's election as a resounding success and a sign that Iraqis have rejected the extremist ideologies and terrorism that often have threatened to unravel both U.S.
[00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:19.811]  and Iraq.
[00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:42.985]  For the Bush administration, Iraq's election surpassed expectations and offered a rare moment of relief after two years of marked by intense debates at home and bitter international divide, the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, billions in mounting costs, and far more bloodshed than anticipated.
[00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:48.628]  Speaking from the White House, four hours after the polls closed, President Bush interrupted the election
[00:13:49.711 --> 00:14:03.636]  As validation of his broader foreign policy agenda, the spread of liberty throughout the Islamic world outlined in his second inaugural address January 20th.
[00:14:04.777 --> 00:14:16.481]  The world is hearing the voice of freedom from the center of the Middle East, said Bush, in great numbers and under great risk, Iraqis have shown their commitment to democracy.
[00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:26.575]  Bush has made the democratization of Iraq the first step in his mission to transform the region.
[00:14:26.896 --> 00:14:35.323]  The administration hopes the election and the positive international response will elicit new cooperation on Iraq and the Arab-Israeli peace efforts.
[00:14:35.463 --> 00:14:43.249]  Folks, then after he gave the speech, he said this, Bush, election won't end violence in Iraq.
[00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:46.091]  Oh no, it's just gotten worse.
[00:14:46.592 --> 00:14:48.133]  President Bush cautioned
[00:14:48.968 --> 00:15:00.836]  And that Iraq's elections will not put to end new terrorist violence, but insisted the vote till mark the beginning of peace, stability, prosperity, and justice for the troubled country.
[00:15:02.156 --> 00:15:09.121]  And the day before that, he said, tomorrow's election will add to the momentum of democracy, Bush said in using his weekly radio address Saturday.
[00:15:11.983 --> 00:15:15.585]  Meanwhile, Tony Blair had similar things to say.
[00:15:16.696 --> 00:15:21.197]  Blair hails Iraq election as a blow to global terrorism.
[00:15:25.218 --> 00:15:32.419]  Again, implying that Iraq was involved in 9-11.
[00:15:32.659 --> 00:15:38.180]  And still, 35% of Americans believe Saddam attacked us on 9-11.
[00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:43.782]  But when you look at supposed conservatives, that number is 70%.
[00:15:47.325 --> 00:15:51.488]  Seventy percent believe that it was Saddam.
[00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:54.231]  Amazing.
[00:15:55.351 --> 00:16:02.157]  And most Americans who call themselves conservatives still believe weapons of mass destruction were found.
[00:16:02.597 --> 00:16:16.188]  Remember the hundreds of times they would claim they found a sarin shell, or a different type of nerve gas bomb, or mustard gas bomb, and then a day later in the back of the paper they'd say, oh actually it wasn't.
[00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:24.855]  I remember photos of UN inspectors unscrewing the nose cones of rockets and sticking their noses in.
[00:16:25.895 --> 00:16:29.077]  And the headline, checking for nerve gas.
[00:16:29.137 --> 00:16:29.998]  Yes, that's what you do.
[00:16:30.018 --> 00:16:32.720]  You unscrew the tip of it and stick your nose in.
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:40.585]  If you have any concern that it's nerve gas, you wear special suits.
[00:16:41.505 --> 00:16:43.067]  You have experts in there.
[00:16:44.567 --> 00:16:46.629]  You don't even touch it.
[00:16:47.723 --> 00:16:55.109]  You have special equipment that picks it up and puts it in a padded case, and it's taken to a special incinerator to be burned.
[00:16:55.149 --> 00:16:56.070]  You don't even check it.
[00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:57.671]  It's so dangerous.
[00:16:57.711 --> 00:17:02.455]  You do not unscrew the cap and stick your nose in it.
[00:17:03.556 --> 00:17:10.421]  They knew all along, ladies and gentlemen, Iraq was a Stone Age country after 12 years of sanctions.
[00:17:10.781 --> 00:17:15.465]  Yeah, back in 1991, when they did the bombardment, that destroyed it all.
[00:17:16.368 --> 00:17:17.828]  We've got the video of the U.S.
[00:17:17.888 --> 00:17:21.769]  marked sarin nerve gas artillery rounds.
[00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.570]  And our troops going, look that's our stuff!
[00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:26.210]  Yeah!
[00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:28.351]  Man, there's thousands of these!
[00:17:28.431 --> 00:17:29.671]  Wonder when we sold them this!
[00:17:29.731 --> 00:17:30.951]  Got the troops talking on tape.
[00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:34.452]  Then they're told, blow it up without protective gear.
[00:17:34.472 --> 00:17:37.333]  And they plant explosives on it, pull back a few miles, detonate it.
[00:17:37.713 --> 00:17:41.093]  And people all over the Middle East thought that a nuclear bomb had gone off.
[00:17:41.153 --> 00:17:43.554]  And they saw the video on TV of the huge
[00:17:46.668 --> 00:17:50.390]  Mushroom cloud filled with chemical and biological weapons.
[00:17:52.972 --> 00:17:58.956]  All part of freedom, of course, but there was your weapons of mass destruction called Camascia.
[00:18:00.076 --> 00:18:00.296]  U.S.
[00:18:00.336 --> 00:18:04.439]  stock indexes and futures gain on Iraq's election news.
[00:18:04.459 --> 00:18:06.280]  AT&T slips.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.261]  This is out of Bloomberg Financial.
[00:18:08.581 --> 00:18:12.644]  When we come back, I want to take some of your calls and play this audio clip and also get into some other news.
[00:18:13.396 --> 00:18:15.457]  But, again, I'd like to hear from you on the election.
[00:18:15.817 --> 00:18:19.898]  Security nominee gave advice to CIA on torture laws.
[00:18:20.579 --> 00:18:22.539]  We already told you that, but now it's in the New York Times.
[00:18:22.999 --> 00:18:23.940]  Mr. Chertoff.
[00:18:25.580 --> 00:18:30.702]  And, uh, if you don't take a job as a prostitute, we can stop your benefits.
[00:18:31.222 --> 00:18:32.663]  That's on the London Telegraph.
[00:18:33.803 --> 00:18:41.606]  Meshes nicely with that, uh, Sacramento Bee article a couple weeks ago, where they teach the 8th grade girls how to be prostitutes.
[00:18:42.521 --> 00:18:43.782]  In the classes, remember that?
[00:18:43.802 --> 00:18:47.804]  And when they got caught doing it, they just said, well, so what?
[00:18:48.104 --> 00:18:54.468]  We're going to go ahead with the teaching here in the class because this is a good job for them.
[00:18:55.949 --> 00:18:57.950]  Also, the Russians are coming.
[00:18:57.990 --> 00:19:01.432]  The FBI is concerned about Moscow's growing number of spies.
[00:19:01.953 --> 00:19:03.974]  What secrets are they looking for?
[00:19:05.535 --> 00:19:10.798]  And continuing the occupational authority in Iraq has lost track of nearly nine billion dollars.
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.861]  That's nothing compared to the new number missing from the Pentagon.
[00:19:14.201 --> 00:19:15.601]  It was 1.2 trillion.
[00:19:15.881 --> 00:19:18.482]  It's now 2.4 trillion CBS News.
[00:19:18.802 --> 00:19:22.463]  I meant to cover this last week, never got to it, but I do have the article here in front of me.
[00:19:22.503 --> 00:19:24.604]  I want to go over that for you as well.
[00:19:24.944 --> 00:19:27.385]  How do you lose track of 2.4 trillion?
[00:19:29.205 --> 00:19:31.406]  You wonder why the globalists want control of our government?
[00:19:31.566 --> 00:19:32.406]  To loot it!
[00:19:34.027 --> 00:19:37.268]  Lip implant tissue linked with man cow disease.
[00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:38.828]  They found a goat with man cow disease.
[00:19:39.933 --> 00:19:41.955]  New developments there for you.
[00:19:42.696 --> 00:19:47.802]  As I said, the 14 characteristics of fascista or fascism.
[00:19:49.543 --> 00:19:51.866]  And we will cover that as well.
[00:19:51.946 --> 00:19:53.087]  InfoWars.com.
[00:19:53.428 --> 00:19:55.690]  PrisonPlanet.tv are just two of the websites.
[00:19:56.591 --> 00:19:57.932]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:19:58.393 --> 00:19:59.394]  Please stay with us.
[00:20:01.522 --> 00:20:07.388]  Hey, I'll tell ya, I have lost over 40 pounds with Vim and Vigor's Collagenate, and my energy level is just incredible.
[00:20:07.448 --> 00:20:09.150]  With me is Carla Jarrett from Vim and Vigor.
[00:20:09.390 --> 00:20:11.272]  Hey, last weekend, I helped my neighbor move.
[00:20:11.553 --> 00:20:13.315]  It took maybe three hours to move in boxes.
[00:20:13.635 --> 00:20:17.399]  Then I mowed the lawn, which I never would have done before I lost that 40 pounds.
[00:20:17.439 --> 00:20:20.602]  And then after that, I went ahead and did my 20 minutes of cardio.
[00:20:21.724 --> 00:20:25.826]  My wife actually mentioned that she was kind of amazed that I did all of that and just kind of kept going.
[00:20:26.146 --> 00:20:29.587]  Well that's great, and just as a reminder, there's no stimulants in Collagenate.
[00:20:29.647 --> 00:20:29.847]  Right.
[00:20:29.867 --> 00:20:34.769]  So it's not that you're taking stimulants, it's more that because you've lost weight you have more energy and you're feeling better.
[00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:35.390]  Absolutely.
[00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:40.852]  I'm sleeping better, I feel better during the day, I don't get as tired in the afternoons, and I'm able to do a lot more.

[00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.775]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[00:22:02.378 --> 00:22:06.880]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:11.322]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:22:11.622 --> 00:22:12.163]  We listened.
[00:22:12.483 --> 00:22:17.445]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:22:17.745 --> 00:22:18.225]  We listened.
[00:22:18.606 --> 00:22:21.647]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:22:22.067 --> 00:22:22.607]  We listened.
[00:22:23.068 --> 00:22:26.049]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and driving.
[00:22:26.049 --> 00:22:26.229]  I think?
[00:22:53.168 --> 00:23:03.871]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:03.891 --> 00:23:07.472]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts No.
[00:23:07.732 --> 00:23:13.153]  1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[00:23:14.114 --> 00:23:17.755]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendments?
[00:23:20.117 --> 00:23:21.937]  This is minimum infringement.
[00:23:22.337 --> 00:23:23.158]  There may be more.
[00:23:24.298 --> 00:23:31.119]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?
[00:23:31.779 --> 00:23:39.640]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.021]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.

[00:24:07.723 --> 00:24:10.726]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:24:11.306 --> 00:24:13.928]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:24:14.328 --> 00:24:17.010]  I'm the guy who's the boss on this highway.
[00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:17.811]  Every day!
[00:24:17.871 --> 00:24:20.253]  I see one of these articles now.
[00:24:20.393 --> 00:24:23.275]  Taser used on a woman in a South Carolina nursing home.
[00:24:23.295 --> 00:24:32.703]  A police officer used a stun gun on a 75 year old woman who became distraught when she could not locate a sick friend in a nursing home according to an internal report.
[00:24:33.323 --> 00:24:35.625]  And it goes on to say she began crying and yelling
[00:24:36.286 --> 00:24:39.569]  And this angered the officer, and so they shot her with it.
[00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:58.423]  Officer Hattie Jean Macon received a verbal warning, at least this happened, and was required to attend a taser retraining course, how about she be fired, after the investigation found she acted prematurely when she used the 50,000 volt taser according to the report released Thursday.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.901]  The woman didn't do anything.
[00:25:02.921 --> 00:25:03.802]  Didn't touch anybody.
[00:25:03.822 --> 00:25:05.403]  Was just crying and freaking out.
[00:25:05.923 --> 00:25:08.265]  That's what people do when their friends are sick.
[00:25:09.706 --> 00:25:11.187]  But see, now we're bad.
[00:25:11.928 --> 00:25:13.389]  So let's just taser you.
[00:25:15.571 --> 00:25:16.992]  Here's another one I want to go over.
[00:25:17.492 --> 00:25:19.934]  CIA refused to release Nazi papers.
[00:25:19.994 --> 00:25:23.757]  Wait until you hear the details of this one.
[00:25:24.297 --> 00:25:27.600]  Bilderberg Group plans spring scheming season.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.142]  We're going to get Jim Tucker on about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:25:30.723 --> 00:25:31.986]  Davos, Switzerland.
[00:25:32.026 --> 00:25:39.101]  We'll tell you about the developments there with Bono and the rest of them sneaking around.
[00:25:40.859 --> 00:25:42.260]  And much more coming up.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.142]  Plus, I want to go over some of the real evidence of this being a staged election in Iraq.
[00:25:46.503 --> 00:25:48.364]  But right now, let's go to your calls.
[00:25:48.824 --> 00:25:50.045]  Larry in Utah.
[00:25:50.105 --> 00:25:51.146]  Larry, you're on the air.
[00:25:51.206 --> 00:25:51.626]  Go ahead.
[00:25:51.946 --> 00:25:52.446]  Yes, sir.
[00:25:52.546 --> 00:25:57.470]  I heard you with George Norrie the other night, and you said some stuff about El Salvador.
[00:25:58.150 --> 00:26:01.992]  I was there from 75 to 79, sir, and you are right on.
[00:26:02.052 --> 00:26:08.817]  And I'd like a copy of that, what you said, to show my family, to stick it in the VA's face, because they lied to me, man.
[00:26:10.509 --> 00:26:12.509]  Well, I was talking about government drug dealers.
[00:26:12.549 --> 00:26:13.770]  Yeah, I know it, partner.
[00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:15.950]  I was a kicker on a C-130.
[00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:20.511]  You remember that movie in 1991 with Dennis Hopper?
[00:26:20.551 --> 00:26:22.052]  He was that big, fat guy?
[00:26:22.952 --> 00:26:23.852]  You remember that movie?
[00:26:23.892 --> 00:26:25.292]  Double Cross was the name of it?
[00:26:25.853 --> 00:26:27.133]  You happen to remember that, sir?
[00:26:27.613 --> 00:26:29.934]  I believe I do.
[00:26:29.974 --> 00:26:30.554]  Tell me more.
[00:26:30.894 --> 00:26:35.755]  It was about Ollie North and the contra thing that was going on down there.
[00:26:36.286 --> 00:26:45.616]  We were taking in medical supplies, but it was really, it was rifles, grenade launchers, and we were dumping it off at home and doping people back.
[00:26:46.337 --> 00:26:49.320]  Yeah, I remember that like it's yesterday.
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.763]  And I ain't slept since I heard you, partner.
[00:26:52.103 --> 00:26:53.204]  And you are right on.
[00:26:53.304 --> 00:26:54.326]  Our computers are down.
[00:26:54.386 --> 00:26:56.988]  I tried to get a hold of you on your website today.
[00:26:57.048 --> 00:26:58.290]  Our computer's all down up here.
[00:26:59.122 --> 00:27:03.844]  Well, I tell you, what you ought to do is email George Norrie and thank him for coming on.
[00:27:03.884 --> 00:27:09.066]  In fact, I wanted to... Man, and you missed one last night with our bill partner.
[00:27:09.366 --> 00:27:11.367]  We are on the edge of Armageddon.
[00:27:11.387 --> 00:27:14.068]  He had a cat named Patrick Heron on there.
[00:27:14.469 --> 00:27:18.950]  And man, if you get over the top of that, you ought to give that a listen, Hoss, because we're on the edge of it.
[00:27:19.331 --> 00:27:24.293]  Well, describe for me what you were doing with the drugs.
[00:27:26.616 --> 00:27:28.678]  I was what we call the kicker, man.
[00:27:28.698 --> 00:27:30.179]  I was in the back end of a 130.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:34.563]  We'd come in about 20 feet off the deck, and we'd shove this shit up, and then we'd come down.
[00:27:34.583 --> 00:27:37.506]  Listen, sir, I appreciate your call.
[00:27:37.526 --> 00:27:37.887]  Thank you.
[00:27:38.167 --> 00:27:38.507]  Thank you.
[00:27:40.349 --> 00:27:51.319]  Look, people get very upset about what happens, and I have talked to hundreds of people who are down there unloading weapons, loading cocaine and heroin, mainly cocaine.
[00:27:54.171 --> 00:27:56.253]  And they get very upset about it.
[00:27:56.273 --> 00:27:57.093]  And we should be upset.
[00:27:57.113 --> 00:27:58.154]  This stuff is horrible.
[00:27:58.214 --> 00:27:59.575]  It's broken down our society.
[00:28:00.715 --> 00:28:04.138]  And that is what we talked about on the broadcast with George Norring.
[00:28:05.678 --> 00:28:07.300]  We talked about it in great detail.
[00:28:08.981 --> 00:28:11.362]  But that was just one of the many things that we talked about.
[00:28:11.462 --> 00:28:18.146]  And I'm glad you mentioned that, Larry, because I was coming into break and there was something I wanted to say and I forgot what it was.
[00:28:18.186 --> 00:28:20.428]  And it was that I wanted to say that I've been on
[00:28:21.474 --> 00:28:32.677]  Dozens of national TV shows, I've been in studio a hundred times in other people's broadcast studios, and no one has ever treated me as nice as George Norrie did.
[00:28:32.697 --> 00:28:48.222]  He is just such a gentleman, a really nice guy, and such a professional to watch him work, and he's such a gentleman, so nice to his scholars, and he's just so nice to me, and has made me such a big part of the broadcast, and then he did TalkFest the next day to
[00:28:49.096 --> 00:28:52.919]  I don't know, a convention center with like 3,000 people in it that came to see him.
[00:28:53.659 --> 00:29:04.067]  And the standing ovation when he got up there, and then a standing ovation when he brought me up to spend about 30 minutes with him on the stage.
[00:29:04.967 --> 00:29:08.870]  And so, just a great guy, and so thank George for me.
[00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:17.616]  It was just a great experience, and I really like the direction he's taken Coast to Coast AM, and he has so many great guests on.
[00:29:18.323 --> 00:29:20.445]  And it was a lot of fun doing it.
[00:29:21.045 --> 00:29:24.588]  And I'm glad that program touched you, Larry.
[00:29:24.628 --> 00:29:28.511]  But even if you get upset, you need to control yourself a little bit.
[00:29:29.051 --> 00:29:31.753]  Alright, we'll come back and talk to a bunch of other callers.
[00:29:31.793 --> 00:29:37.297]  Play this little 3 or 4 minute clip about the 14 markers of fascism.
[00:29:38.658 --> 00:29:41.620]  And we'll also get into all this other news that I just mentioned.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.324]  But first, your calls on the other side of this quick break.
[00:29:46.909 --> 00:29:49.891]  And if you want to hear that interview I did with George, go to Coast to Coast AM.
[00:29:51.853 --> 00:29:52.794]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.254 --> 00:29:54.896]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.796 --> 00:29:58.599]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.581 --> 00:30:05.785]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[00:30:06.545 --> 00:30:14.792]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.111]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[00:30:17.831 --> 00:30:23.793]  While you listen, Verbal Advantage will give you the confidence that comes with a strong command of the English language.
[00:30:24.433 --> 00:30:25.994]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[00:30:26.534 --> 00:30:28.695]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[00:30:29.275 --> 00:30:31.296]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[00:30:31.876 --> 00:30:32.956]  And it's so easy.
[00:30:33.676 --> 00:30:35.697]  To learn, you simply listen.
[00:30:36.517 --> 00:30:37.138]  When you want.
[00:30:37.698 --> 00:30:38.318]  Where you want.
[00:30:39.138 --> 00:30:44.100]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the Verbal Advantage they need for success.
[00:30:44.969 --> 00:30:47.673]  To learn more about Verbal Advantage, call now.
[00:30:47.693 --> 00:30:47.773]  1-800-4419-W.
[00:30:47.793 --> 00:30:48.654]  That's 419WORD.
[00:30:48.674 --> 00:30:48.754]  1-800-419-W.
[00:31:01.693 --> 00:31:05.577]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:05.817 --> 00:31:11.242]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:11.522 --> 00:31:21.912]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:22.052 --> 00:31:26.396]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.576 --> 00:31:27.377]  We're good to go!
[00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:42.511]  We're good to go.
[00:31:42.591 --> 00:31:42.991]  I think?
[00:31:43.031 --> 00:31:43.392]  I think?
[00:32:03.661 --> 00:32:09.146]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:09.566 --> 00:32:13.809]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:14.030 --> 00:32:21.075]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:21.456 --> 00:32:27.561]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:27.701 --> 00:32:28.922]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:29.262 --> 00:32:32.223]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:32:32.363 --> 00:32:33.264]  Eliminate the cost.
[00:32:33.324 --> 00:32:34.364]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:32:34.684 --> 00:32:41.927]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:32:42.227 --> 00:32:45.588]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:32:46.028 --> 00:32:49.190]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:49.290]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.410]  866-885-6625.
[00:32:49.450 --> 00:32:50.491]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:32:50.531 --> 00:32:50.731]  Call today.
[00:33:20.182 --> 00:33:26.825]  All right, folks.
[00:33:26.905 --> 00:33:30.166]  Back live here.
[00:33:30.186 --> 00:33:34.527]  33 minutes and 30 seconds into this first hour.
[00:33:34.587 --> 00:33:40.730]  Kathryn Albrecht coming up to talk about those little tiny tracker chips they're putting in everything and three new big developments.
[00:33:40.790 --> 00:33:44.171]  Two of them she's going to break here on air coming up.
[00:33:44.956 --> 00:33:52.818]  In just a few minutes, not even on our website yet, so you don't want to miss it, we're posting it on Infowars.com.
[00:33:52.838 --> 00:34:05.562]  Before I go back to Andrew and Randy and Tony and Dion and others that are patiently holding, I want to encourage everybody out there who's online to get a membership at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:08.302 --> 00:34:14.726]  15 cents a day if you sign up for a yearly subscription, 19 cents a day if you sign up for a monthly subscription.
[00:34:15.567 --> 00:34:17.808]  $5.95 a month, it just goes to pay for our bandwidth.
[00:34:18.528 --> 00:34:21.810]  All 11 of my films and my emergency release, so 12 films.
[00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:28.034]  9-11 emergency release, you can't get on VHS or DVD, it's just there on the website only for members.
[00:34:30.415 --> 00:34:33.017]  I don't know, like a hundred special TV reports I've done.
[00:34:33.057 --> 00:34:33.897]  I do one every week.
[00:34:35.738 --> 00:34:36.659]  Many weeks I do two.
[00:34:37.561 --> 00:34:50.971]  Special video reports with people like Dean Haglin from the X-Files or I'm going to put up clips of myself with George Norrie and up on stage with him at TalkFest and taking the people's questions and going over the New World Order.
[00:34:52.231 --> 00:34:53.672]  That's going up tomorrow.
[00:34:54.113 --> 00:34:55.674]  Dozens of other great films.
[00:34:55.694 --> 00:34:57.215]  A whole slew of e-books.
[00:34:57.295 --> 00:35:02.939]  My book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, Paul Watts' book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsor Terror, and the New World Order.
[00:35:03.439 --> 00:35:05.180]  Normally a 300-page e-book is about $5.
[00:35:06.707 --> 00:35:18.533]  I don't see for the cost of $5.95 for a monthly subscription, you could go print both my book, my book off, Paul Watts' book off, you could burn copies on CD, all my films, you could do whatever!
[00:35:18.893 --> 00:35:20.714]  I just want to get the information out to people.
[00:35:21.994 --> 00:35:25.496]  There's just so much on the site, it's ridiculous.
[00:35:25.536 --> 00:35:27.797]  It's the best deal out there.
[00:35:27.957 --> 00:35:30.879]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:35:31.559 --> 00:35:32.179]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[00:35:34.369 --> 00:35:42.616]  Or, if you want hard copies on DVD or VHS of a bunch of great films I carry, I've got Juice of Preservation of Farms' Ownerships video.
[00:35:43.017 --> 00:35:48.601]  Innocence Portrayed, the best Second Amendment video I've ever seen on VHS and DVD.
[00:35:48.621 --> 00:35:54.506]  When you buy one copy of it, you get three Grandpa Jack comic books.
[00:35:54.687 --> 00:35:58.150]  And they're written for adults and children, but they go over the history of gun control.
[00:35:58.190 --> 00:36:02.073]  And I've seen these comic books wake up adults that didn't understand the Second Amendment.
[00:36:02.728 --> 00:36:05.656]  So you get three comic books and one of those videos when you get one.
[00:36:06.499 --> 00:36:09.387]  You can get 9-11-The-Road-To-Tyranny for $20.99.
[00:36:12.677 --> 00:36:17.199]  $4.95, but when you buy additional copies, it's $5.95, and it was hard to find on the shopping cart.
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:21.682]  For some reason, we've made that easier to find, the specials, on the shopping cart.
[00:36:21.722 --> 00:36:23.403]  For those that were emailing me, going, where is it?
[00:36:23.423 --> 00:36:26.885]  It was always there, but it was hard to find for some reason, buried in the shopping cart.
[00:36:26.905 --> 00:36:33.349]  A little bit easier to navigate, but just go to InfoWars.com and click on the shopping cart, and go to the specials, and you'll find all that.
[00:36:34.089 --> 00:36:35.891]  American Dictators, my newest film.
[00:36:36.371 --> 00:36:37.452]  Almost two hours long.
[00:36:37.472 --> 00:36:39.113]  $19.95 each additional copy.
[00:36:39.133 --> 00:36:39.113]  $5.95.
[00:36:39.153 --> 00:36:42.976]  That way you can buy four or five copies and give them as gifts and wake people up.
[00:36:43.196 --> 00:36:45.017]  Or just buy one copy and make copies.
[00:36:45.578 --> 00:36:46.098]  Whatever.
[00:36:46.118 --> 00:36:47.419]  Just get it out to people.
[00:36:47.459 --> 00:36:48.360]  That's the goal here.
[00:36:49.821 --> 00:37:02.967]  90% of those that see Road to Tyranny, or Masters of Terror, or Police State 3 Total Enslavement, or Matrix of Evil, or Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, or America Destroyed by Design, 90% of those that see the films are waking up.
[00:37:03.067 --> 00:37:07.949]  That's the numbers we're getting from listeners and people on the streets, and write-ups in newspapers.
[00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:10.611]  I mean, it's just, it's almost all positive.
[00:37:11.391 --> 00:37:14.172]  And God bless you, those of you that have gotten the films and taken action.
[00:37:14.213 --> 00:37:15.073]  We couldn't do it without you.
[00:37:15.666 --> 00:37:20.447]  But we are having a massive effect, so if you want hard copies of any of these films, operators are there right now.
[00:37:20.487 --> 00:37:21.768]  They can answer all your questions.
[00:37:22.208 --> 00:37:23.248]  No obligation to buy.
[00:37:23.288 --> 00:37:25.429]  Just call and ask about the different specials, different titles.
[00:37:25.449 --> 00:37:26.089]  1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[00:37:26.109 --> 00:37:27.069]  Or just write to me.
[00:37:27.089 --> 00:37:30.130]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:47.070]  All right, let's go back to the calls.
[00:37:47.731 --> 00:37:49.431]  Andrew in New York, you're on the air.
[00:37:49.491 --> 00:37:49.971]  Go ahead.
[00:37:50.531 --> 00:37:51.431]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[00:37:51.991 --> 00:37:53.792]  You know, I want to appreciate you.
[00:37:53.892 --> 00:37:55.372]  I finally know what I am.
[00:37:55.432 --> 00:37:56.672]  I'm a liberal communist.
[00:37:56.692 --> 00:38:01.974]  At least now whenever anybody asks me, I can tell them, yeah, Mr. Bush seems to think that I'm a liberal communist.
[00:38:02.034 --> 00:38:02.814]  I guess that's what I am.
[00:38:03.994 --> 00:38:05.694]  You're a liberal communist because?
[00:38:06.814 --> 00:38:08.955]  Because I seem to think that there's
[00:38:09.685 --> 00:38:17.251]  Funny business going on in the government, and for some reason everybody seems to believe that politicians are incapable of doing wrong!
[00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:17.991]  Well they are!
[00:38:18.211 --> 00:38:29.680]  And look, back when I was bashing Bill Clinton for eight years, I was a hardcore right-winger, probably a secret Nazi, and now I'm an ultra-communist!
[00:38:30.748 --> 00:38:39.794]  Of course, I'm just a freedom lover who stands up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and the Second Amendment, and the borders, and I'm against phony wars, but hey, that's communism.
[00:38:40.475 --> 00:38:49.281]  I guess if you're not with the people who are interested in torture, then you're not a good American.
[00:38:49.521 --> 00:38:56.026]  But don't worry, when we get some Democrat in controlling all this, and it's the same exact agenda, suddenly we'll be fascist.
[00:38:57.074 --> 00:38:58.576]  It's one swing or the other.
[00:38:58.816 --> 00:39:03.881]  Now, I don't know if you noticed, but A&E had another, uh, they replayed that show.
[00:39:03.901 --> 00:39:08.085]  They did about the Flight 800 going down over Long Island Sound.
[00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:15.893]  And, um, now I flew on that self-same flight 30 days to the day just before that happened.
[00:39:15.953 --> 00:39:18.796]  So, you might say that I have a personal interest in this.
[00:39:19.329 --> 00:39:20.849]  And it's the same thing over and over again.
[00:39:20.889 --> 00:39:22.030]  They've got the witnesses there.
[00:39:22.070 --> 00:39:28.331]  Yeah, I saw a missile come up from behind one of the houses there on the edge of the beach, and it went up and it hit the plane.
[00:39:28.752 --> 00:39:30.652]  We've got all these people all saying the same thing.
[00:39:31.032 --> 00:39:33.613]  I saw a missile go up from the ground and hit the plane.
[00:39:34.353 --> 00:39:37.394]  And at the same time, they keep saying, well, we never did find the exact area.
[00:39:37.414 --> 00:39:38.674]  But that's because they're communists.
[00:39:38.694 --> 00:39:39.194]  They're evil.
[00:39:40.014 --> 00:39:43.695]  Listen, Bill Clinton told us, and he doesn't lie.
[00:39:44.696 --> 00:39:45.776]  And the FBI doesn't lie.
[00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:47.341]  They've never been caught lying.
[00:39:47.381 --> 00:39:55.329]  They haven't been caught coast to coast with their crime labs defrauding people, running scams, framing up, running murder for hire, running prostitution and drugs.
[00:39:55.449 --> 00:39:57.411]  It doesn't matter if they've been caught hundreds of times.
[00:39:57.451 --> 00:39:58.152]  It just doesn't exist.
[00:39:58.172 --> 00:39:58.973]  You're evil if you say it.
[00:39:59.533 --> 00:40:06.020]  And it doesn't matter if 850 plus witnesses, including hundreds of police officers,
[00:40:06.893 --> 00:40:19.501]  And over 200 of the 800 witnesses, helicopter pilots and Navy officers, over 60 of them, who have been in Vietnam and seen missile trails, doesn't matter if they say they saw two missiles.
[00:40:20.161 --> 00:40:20.881]  Doesn't matter.
[00:40:21.002 --> 00:40:22.542]  Doesn't matter.
[00:40:22.582 --> 00:40:23.543]  None of it matters, sir.
[00:40:24.063 --> 00:40:25.624]  The government doesn't lie to you.
[00:40:25.664 --> 00:40:27.125]  They told you it wasn't a missile.
[00:40:27.425 --> 00:40:28.526]  Just shut up.
[00:40:29.487 --> 00:40:35.090]  And that, in and of itself, I absolutely, I cannot
[00:40:35.814 --> 00:40:38.315]  I don't tolerate any nonsense like that.
[00:40:38.935 --> 00:40:44.976]  It's built into me, I guess, that when I see things like that, I have to speak up.
[00:40:45.316 --> 00:40:53.578]  And when I speak up, I'm told I'm crazy, or you're only using half-truths, or there's no witnesses.
[00:40:53.638 --> 00:40:55.118]  Listen, Andrew, and thanks for the call.
[00:40:55.138 --> 00:40:55.619]  Great points.
[00:40:55.659 --> 00:40:57.439]  That's happening less and less, okay?
[00:40:58.746 --> 00:41:05.669]  And if you run into people that laugh at you and don't care, now if somebody disagrees with you but is serious and wants to have a real debate, spend hours with them.
[00:41:06.029 --> 00:41:14.553]  But somebody that just giggles and has that built-in defense mechanism of nothing's wrong, nothing bad happening to America, ha ha ha, that's laziness.
[00:41:14.653 --> 00:41:15.913]  That's intellectual laziness.
[00:41:15.933 --> 00:41:17.074]  That's intellectual cowardice.
[00:41:17.494 --> 00:41:23.136]  They deep down know the truth and they just want to try to shirk it off and ignore it and don't want to have any responsibility.
[00:41:23.336 --> 00:41:25.017]  So fine, just move on to the next person.
[00:41:26.518 --> 00:41:26.818]  But, uh,
[00:41:29.716 --> 00:41:31.037]  It's the same thing with this election.
[00:41:32.799 --> 00:41:35.401]  The government appointed, the military appointed the leaders.
[00:41:35.962 --> 00:41:37.123]  No one ran against them.
[00:41:38.024 --> 00:41:43.549]  And as I predicted, they had like one or two people after the election, they go, oh, this person secretly ran and they won.
[00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:45.250]  And they're an opposition candidate.
[00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:46.211]  Ooh, what's going to happen?
[00:41:46.231 --> 00:41:47.292]  And it's just a staged deal.
[00:41:48.263 --> 00:41:51.805]  There's one or two of those I've seen on the news as they did a few tokens to make you think.
[00:41:52.426 --> 00:41:53.367]  And it's admitted.
[00:41:53.487 --> 00:41:56.989]  Secret polling places that know who the candidates were.
[00:41:57.409 --> 00:41:59.651]  Almost everybody who was already appointed won.
[00:42:00.731 --> 00:42:01.952]  I mean, it's a staged deal.
[00:42:03.293 --> 00:42:04.434]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:42:04.714 --> 00:42:06.816]  But it's just like TWA Flight 800.
[00:42:07.236 --> 00:42:09.517]  Doesn't matter if there's 850-something witnesses.
[00:42:10.638 --> 00:42:14.621]  Doesn't matter if they wouldn't let the media see the plane or
[00:42:15.293 --> 00:42:23.256]  Wouldn't matter if it had big blast holes in it, and doesn't matter if reporters who snuck in and got pieces of it have found explosive residue.
[00:42:23.736 --> 00:42:25.316]  None of that matters, sir.
[00:42:25.876 --> 00:42:35.799]  Just ignore the state police and the city police and the firemen and the military that was doing maneuvers, the helicopter pilots from just a mile away that saw the missiles.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.280]  It doesn't matter.
[00:42:38.041 --> 00:42:44.224]  When you see, I mean, you know, we could all see an airplane in the sky and we saw the missile right next to us take off and fly up and blow it up.
[00:42:44.604 --> 00:42:46.465]  If they say it didn't happen, it didn't happen.
[00:42:46.946 --> 00:42:50.447]  After all, a Bush administration official told the New York Times, we make reality.
[00:42:51.048 --> 00:42:54.209]  We'll make reality tomorrow and we'll change it the next week and we'll change it again.
[00:42:54.709 --> 00:42:56.730]  And you'll just sit there and watch us change reality.
[00:42:58.151 --> 00:43:03.714]  So, uh, you just gotta learn how to just, uh, suspend disbelief and just believe your government.
[00:43:04.933 --> 00:43:05.313]  Okay.
[00:43:06.854 --> 00:43:07.655]  Is it Rodney?
[00:43:08.255 --> 00:43:09.556]  In mass, you're on the air.
[00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:10.036]  Go ahead.
[00:43:10.336 --> 00:43:10.636]  Randy.
[00:43:11.077 --> 00:43:11.817]  Randy, go ahead.
[00:43:12.538 --> 00:43:16.160]  Yeah, I'm just wondering when the secret elections will take place in America.
[00:43:17.741 --> 00:43:18.701]  Think that'll ever happen?
[00:43:18.961 --> 00:43:20.222]  Well, that's a good point.
[00:43:22.323 --> 00:43:27.667]  Since we're called this is the model of a good election, you have secret candidates, why not have it here?
[00:43:28.047 --> 00:43:30.068]  Yeah, it'd be under the guise of national security.
[00:43:30.748 --> 00:43:31.609]  I bet you that the
[00:43:32.429 --> 00:43:33.089]  If they would give.
[00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:39.213]  Well, actually, remember before the election, they said if there's a terror attack, we may just cancel the election altogether?
[00:43:39.513 --> 00:43:39.713]  Uh-huh.
[00:43:40.334 --> 00:43:52.560]  And so, they're actually getting us ready for that, and they got Congress three weeks ago to pass the Doomsday Bill, where Congress is taken over by a select group if there's an attack, and again, sounds like freedom to me.
[00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:56.703]  I want to ask you, I heard that the Patriot Act II is being revised.
[00:43:56.723 --> 00:43:57.923]  Do you know anything about that?
[00:43:58.324 --> 00:44:00.605]  Well, parts of Patriot Act II were passed
[00:44:01.634 --> 00:44:06.397]  I have a copy of that legislation.
[00:44:06.457 --> 00:44:09.920]  Now, Patriot X3, have you ever heard any rumors about that?
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.423]  Yes, the government has said that there may be another Patriot Act.
[00:44:32.103 --> 00:44:37.507]  And really, then there's also Victory Act 1, Victory Act 2, there's lots of different legislation.
[00:44:37.768 --> 00:44:45.714]  Because I have somebody who is trying to get a hold of a copy of Patriot Act 3, who she tells me that it's already set, ready to go.
[00:44:45.774 --> 00:44:48.116]  Well, I mean, Ashcroft for six months...
[00:44:49.142 --> 00:44:52.985]  After Patriot 2 was officially introduced, we had a copy of it.
[00:44:53.025 --> 00:45:00.051]  We had the legislative enrollment slip from the Library of Congress by January 6.
[00:45:02.456 --> 00:45:08.077]  Uh, 2003 we had it, and six months later Ashcroft finally said, okay, it exists.
[00:45:08.457 --> 00:45:12.718]  But for six months, he's testified before Congress, it does not exist.
[00:45:12.738 --> 00:45:13.658]  I remember watching that.
[00:45:13.678 --> 00:45:15.899]  People that aid Al-Qaeda say it.
[00:45:15.919 --> 00:45:17.399]  In fact, I have the clips in my film, Police Day 3.
[00:45:17.439 --> 00:45:20.380]  He said, if you say it exists, you're aiding Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.300]  Yep, I remember.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.440]  And you will lose your liberty.
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:23.340]  It doesn't exist.
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:26.141]  Only people that want to aid Al-Qaeda say it exists.
[00:45:26.421 --> 00:45:27.641]  By the way, that's a quote.
[00:45:28.246 --> 00:45:29.607]  Yeah, I remember seeing it.
[00:45:29.947 --> 00:45:30.828]  It's all part of freedom, sir.
[00:45:31.268 --> 00:45:31.788]  Thanks for the call.
[00:45:31.908 --> 00:45:32.809]  Thank you.
[00:45:32.869 --> 00:45:36.231]  Yes, JTMPG officially introduced Patriot 2.
[00:45:36.731 --> 00:45:43.295]  Everyone's got copies of it, and again, later tried to pass it several times, did pass pieces of it, but it doesn't exist.
[00:45:43.335 --> 00:45:47.077]  You are actually aiding Al-Qaeda if you say it exists.
[00:45:47.117 --> 00:45:49.479]  Again, I guess you're aiding Al-Qaeda if you see missiles.
[00:45:49.499 --> 00:45:50.399]  Hit the WFY 800.
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:45:54.241]  If you love freedom, you're aiding Al-Qaeda.
[00:45:54.261 --> 00:45:54.962]  Who's up next here?
[00:45:57.426 --> 00:45:58.626]  Deion and Tejas.
[00:45:58.686 --> 00:45:59.427]  Go ahead, Deion.
[00:45:59.987 --> 00:46:01.087]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:46:01.187 --> 00:46:09.170]  I'm a fellow Austinite who has seen the crux of this wicked, wicked Babylonian system.
[00:46:09.830 --> 00:46:18.633]  I had a few points you had requested of your callers earlier to give response to the Iraqi election.
[00:46:18.774 --> 00:46:22.415]  Yes, a caller actually playing ball with me!
[00:46:22.635 --> 00:46:22.975]  Wow!
[00:46:23.755 --> 00:46:24.456]  Yeah, I listen.
[00:46:26.629 --> 00:46:31.434]  My response, I just have a few points and I'll let you go on and say what it is that you want to say.
[00:46:34.196 --> 00:46:35.718]  First of all, I was disgusted.
[00:46:35.778 --> 00:46:37.339]  That's the first thing.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:41.643]  It was reminiscent of my response to the inauguration here.
[00:46:44.366 --> 00:46:45.227]  I have a few points.
[00:46:45.367 --> 00:46:50.932]  One was that there was no coverage about the various mortar attacks that were done.
[00:46:53.019 --> 00:46:54.601]  I was watching C-SPAN yesterday.
[00:46:54.641 --> 00:47:06.089]  They had several Iraqi nationals, radio hosts, and people sort of covering the elections yesterday.
[00:47:06.450 --> 00:47:08.952]  There was no coverage about the various mortar attacks.
[00:47:08.972 --> 00:47:09.512]  That's one.
[00:47:09.652 --> 00:47:20.561]  Two, I was utterly disgusted at how they did the same thing, the media that is, did the same thing that they did in the inauguration, which is praise the
[00:47:21.414 --> 00:47:36.260]  Praise the very intense and vicious martial law that was imposed on the Iraqi people in order not to get to the polls or to get to the polls to vote for whoever they had chosen.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:46.604]  And three, I was disgusted at the fact that the candidates and the campaigns that they were running were still unannounced by
[00:47:48.482 --> 00:47:57.525]  Very well into the day yesterday until late yesterday I saw they had announced maybe three people who were running.
[00:47:58.285 --> 00:48:00.126]  And now let's make that clear.
[00:48:00.386 --> 00:48:06.228]  Since you bring this up, on PrisonPlanet.com we have confusion surrounds our RAC poll turnout we did.
[00:48:07.068 --> 00:48:08.949]  Just four flashbacks.
[00:48:09.269 --> 00:48:09.489]  Right.
[00:48:10.009 --> 00:48:12.250]  Prime Minister of Terror, who was a lawyer.
[00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:14.011]  Number two, source, Iraq election.
[00:48:14.311 --> 00:48:14.951]  A done deal.
[00:48:15.011 --> 00:48:17.853]  Villagers forced to vote for allowing to keep food rations.
[00:48:18.273 --> 00:48:21.074]  Flashback, Iraq election, candidates to be kept secret.
[00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:21.494]  Right.
[00:48:21.514 --> 00:48:22.635]  Christian Science Monitor.
[00:48:23.075 --> 00:48:23.275]  Right.
[00:48:23.495 --> 00:48:25.176]  Flashback, non-election in Iraq.
[00:48:25.856 --> 00:48:26.276]  Folks!
[00:48:27.517 --> 00:48:29.878]  Hey, hey Alex, I want to give you an example of
[00:48:31.199 --> 00:48:37.043]  Just a quick example, of course it's to a much milder event than what happens in the neighborhood that I grew up here in Austin.
[00:48:38.184 --> 00:48:39.705]  And then I'll get off the phone.
[00:48:42.446 --> 00:48:57.656]  You know, what happens a lot of times during election time here down in Texas, and I know for a fact in Austin is, in the neighborhood I grew up, I grew up in Dove Springs, which is a southern neighborhood here in Austin.
[00:48:58.601 --> 00:48:59.842]  You know, your phone's beeping.
[00:48:59.902 --> 00:49:00.862]  Is it running out of power?
[00:49:00.922 --> 00:49:01.462]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:01.623 --> 00:49:03.103]  That's what I'm trying to hurry up.
[00:49:04.844 --> 00:49:21.112]  And the thing about it is, is what they would do is officials would end up raiding this big, you know, this big, you know, supposedly, you know, head guy of some, you know, some gang organization or whatever, whatever they would call it.
[00:49:22.233 --> 00:49:24.854]  And mysteriously, oddly enough,
[00:49:25.729 --> 00:49:52.419]  uh... you know two to three days later they would release uh... they would release a certain convict from prison who would then come to stay in the neighborhood uh... this person would be allowed to do whatever it is that they wanted untouched by the police and anybody from my neighborhood can tell you this uh... so how did that supposedly affect the elections?
[00:49:52.439 --> 00:49:53.339]  Well this is what I'm saying
[00:49:55.089 --> 00:49:57.950]  We were going to hear it, but the phone ran out of juice.
[00:49:58.370 --> 00:50:01.391]  Folks, it's better to call me on a landline.
[00:50:01.711 --> 00:50:08.733]  Number one, cell phones or cordless phones, and we'll take calls from cell phones, but cordless phones don't have good audio.
[00:50:09.254 --> 00:50:11.214]  Because it's radio frequency back to the jack.
[00:50:11.674 --> 00:50:12.995]  And they don't sound good, number one.
[00:50:13.655 --> 00:50:15.296]  Number two, they cut out.
[00:50:15.336 --> 00:50:15.816]  They do that.
[00:50:15.916 --> 00:50:19.397]  So if you hear your phone about to cut out, go get on a landline.
[00:50:20.609 --> 00:50:26.935]  So we were going to get to hear that, but we did not get a chance to, so call back some other time and let us know, sir.
[00:50:26.955 --> 00:50:27.856]  Interesting phone call.
[00:50:29.097 --> 00:50:35.443]  When we get back, I want to play the 14 Indicators of Fascism.
[00:50:35.463 --> 00:50:45.033]  We're going to get Catherine Albrecht on and continue with your phone calls, and there's so much other news concerning an entire cornucopia of issues.
[00:50:45.876 --> 00:50:49.983]  So we'll be back right after this quick break on the other side.
[00:50:50.724 --> 00:50:57.977]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, and you're listening to the GCN Radio Network, the Genesis Network.
[00:51:01.747 --> 00:51:06.090]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.251 --> 00:51:10.694]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.834 --> 00:51:15.218]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.258 --> 00:51:16.599]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:22.604]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.664 --> 00:51:29.610]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.730 --> 00:51:31.772]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.972 --> 00:51:42.581]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.601 --> 00:51:44.002]  If you want to understand what the new
[00:51:44.042 --> 00:51:44.462]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.405 --> 00:52:03.026]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.166 --> 00:52:07.250]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:07.410 --> 00:52:10.292]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:10.372 --> 00:52:17.098]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.258 --> 00:52:20.280]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:22.882]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:23.002 --> 00:52:30.889]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:33.170]  Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform.
[00:52:33.350 --> 00:52:34.111]  MTBE.
[00:52:34.311 --> 00:52:34.751]  Radon 222.
[00:52:35.211 --> 00:52:37.212]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[00:52:37.352 --> 00:52:42.455]  Even nitrates and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:52:42.615 --> 00:52:50.380]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black Berkey purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:50.840]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:50.900 --> 00:52:52.601]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.

[00:54:05.430 --> 00:54:25.701]  Alright, now this is a video piece, but it's the audio from it, and it's the 14 characteristics of fascism, and I notice they try to mix in religion to it, and they try to put a few little false left bombs in the middle of it, but I want to come back in the next hour and briefly comment on it, then go to Catherine Albrecht and your calls, but here it is, stay with us.
[00:54:26.638 --> 00:54:47.851]  There are 14 defining characteristics according to a college professor, Dr. Lawrence Britt, who has examined fascist regimes.
[00:54:48.111 --> 00:54:50.993]  There are 14 defining characteristics, so you tell me.
[00:54:52.354 --> 00:54:54.115]  Powerful and continuing nationalism.
[00:54:55.214 --> 00:54:58.356]  Flags are seen everywhere, flag symbols on clothing, public displays.
[00:54:58.837 --> 00:55:01.038]  Disdain for the recognition of human rights.
[00:55:01.899 --> 00:55:08.864]  People tend to look the other way or even prove of torture, semi-executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners with no charges.
[00:55:09.445 --> 00:55:13.668]  Identifying enemies or scapegoats as a unifying cause.
[00:55:14.548 --> 00:55:17.791]  Like people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy.
[00:55:18.544 --> 00:55:22.025]  Over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe.
[00:55:22.625 --> 00:55:24.146]  Supremacy of the military.
[00:55:24.586 --> 00:55:30.208]  Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding.
[00:55:31.408 --> 00:55:33.149]  Rampant sexism.
[00:55:34.249 --> 00:55:35.769]  Controlled mass media.
[00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:39.911]  Obsession with national security.
[00:55:41.171 --> 00:55:43.852]  Religion and government are intertwined.
[00:55:44.568 --> 00:55:54.436]  Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenants of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.
[00:55:55.477 --> 00:55:58.820]  Number nine, corporate power is protected.
[00:56:00.061 --> 00:56:02.663]  Number ten, labor power is suppressed.
[00:56:03.704 --> 00:56:06.686]  Number eleven, disdain for intellectuals and the arts
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:10.082]  Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.
[00:56:10.502 --> 00:56:13.444]  Number 12, obsession with crime and punishment.
[00:56:14.004 --> 00:56:18.167]  Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce the laws.
[00:56:19.408 --> 00:56:22.169]  Number 13, rampant cronyism and corruption.
[00:56:22.970 --> 00:56:26.652]  And number 14, fraudulent elections.
[00:56:27.873 --> 00:56:30.755]  Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham.
[00:56:32.808 --> 00:56:38.770]  Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.
[00:56:39.530 --> 00:56:47.352]  Of the 14 defining characteristics of fascism, Bush's America falls neatly into all 14 categories.
[00:56:47.952 --> 00:56:48.972]  Do you disagree?
[00:56:53.194 --> 00:57:02.096]  Now that's a lot stronger when you see it... It's a lot stronger when you see it with the actual news articles and documents as it's going over them.
[00:57:02.802 --> 00:57:05.564]  But again, the Democrats are all voting for this stuff.
[00:57:05.644 --> 00:57:06.505]  They all love it.
[00:57:07.306 --> 00:57:09.988]  And when you talk about religious groups, it is true with fascism.
[00:57:10.008 --> 00:57:13.191]  They come in and pay off and take control of the churches.
[00:57:13.211 --> 00:57:18.015]  When you talk about sexism, everybody's being degraded.
[00:57:18.055 --> 00:57:19.696]  The family's being broken down.
[00:57:20.337 --> 00:57:27.483]  And this supposed liberal atmosphere, you notice how women basically are mimicking prostitutes now in their dress and behavior.
[00:57:29.671 --> 00:57:34.614]  Again, the poor liberals think that it's all Bush that's getting them.
[00:57:35.114 --> 00:57:36.595]  No, it's the New World Order.
[00:57:37.095 --> 00:57:43.799]  And as soon as a Democrat gets in office someday, it's going to be just as bad or worse, and then I'm sure you'll all go back to sleep.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:45.840]  And, you know, that's the question.
[00:57:46.160 --> 00:57:51.203]  Do you really understand that fascism, communism, socialism, it's all command and control?
[00:57:51.223 --> 00:57:57.667]  And there's a few differences how they manage the plantation, but it's the same ends.
[00:57:58.513 --> 00:58:05.762]  So we better get back to the Constitution and the Bill of Rights itself instead of being this fascistic modern society.
[00:58:05.802 --> 00:58:09.026]  But what happens in a fascist society is the liberals
[00:58:09.796 --> 00:58:18.423]  normally lead into a fascist society, they socialize the wealth, then the corporations use the government to come and confiscate that communalized wealth.
[00:58:18.743 --> 00:58:23.827]  So, fascism truly comes out of socialism, my friends.
[00:58:24.027 --> 00:58:29.311]  And again, that's because the political terms have been totally scrambled.
[00:58:29.552 --> 00:58:32.434]  I mean, look at Russia, where you've got six oligarchs running things.
[00:58:32.494 --> 00:58:34.996]  Or China, where just a few families own and run everything.
[00:58:35.517 --> 00:58:39.783]  Communism, fascism, it's all just a way for the elite to dominate the population.
[00:58:39.803 --> 00:58:42.968]  Alright, we'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:43.008 --> 00:58:47.375]  Catherine Albrecht, your calls, a ton of news, and just so much more.
[00:58:47.776 --> 00:58:49.479]  PrisonPlanet.tv, check it out.
[00:58:57.947 --> 00:58:58.588]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.248 --> 00:59:00.329]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.029 --> 00:59:02.110]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.770 --> 00:59:03.611]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.352 --> 00:59:05.232]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.933 --> 00:59:09.855]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.115 --> 00:59:14.178]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.695 --> 00:59:30.897]  We're already into hour number two on this Monday, the 31st day of January 2005.
[00:59:31.937 --> 00:59:34.178]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:34.198 --> 00:59:38.560]  We've been talking about the so-called elections in Iraq, and they're not elections at all.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:50.325]  It's hundreds of appointed people running unopposed in almost every case, with the people running against them being secret until after the election, until the afternoon of the election, then they begin to announce it.
[00:59:50.345 --> 00:59:51.585]  I mean, it's totally staged.
[00:59:52.966 --> 00:59:53.906]  And that's just the facts.
[00:59:55.254 --> 01:00:02.317]  And how people can buy anything else psychologically is just hard for me to believe.
[01:00:02.657 --> 01:00:09.379]  Catherine Albrecht's coming up a little bit later in the show to talk about RFID tracking chips and some new developments there.
[01:00:09.399 --> 01:00:11.500]  You know, these RFID chips are going in everywhere.
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.061]  Years ago we talked about this.
[01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:14.661]  People were like, RFID what?
[01:00:15.182 --> 01:00:20.644]  Now almost everybody knows about them because it's all over the news telling you how great it is and how we've just got to accept it.
[01:00:21.204 --> 01:00:22.444]  So we'll be covering that.
[01:00:22.544 --> 01:00:24.185]  Also, United Press International
[01:00:24.898 --> 01:00:29.040]  As a very interesting article, CIA refuses to release Nazi papers.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:39.183]  The CIA refuses to provide documents sought by the US government under a law requiring disclosure of classified records related to Nazi war criminals.
[01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:45.585]  Under the 98 law, the spy agency has already provided more than 1.2 million pages of documents.
[01:00:45.605 --> 01:00:53.068]  Some of the pages made public last year showed a closer relationship between the US government and Nazi war criminals than had previously been understood.
[01:00:54.227 --> 01:00:59.151]  Like Joseph Mingala, Klaus Barley, the rest of them.
[01:00:59.451 --> 01:01:03.654]  But for nearly three years the CIA has nixed requests for more records.
[01:01:04.235 --> 01:01:20.987]  Congressional officials and some members of the government working group told the New York Times the officials believe the stance seems to violate the law and they say the agency has sometimes agreed to provide information about ex-Nazis but not about the extent of the agency's dealings with them after World War II.
[01:01:21.507 --> 01:01:23.489]  I think the CIA has defined the law
[01:01:24.252 --> 01:01:30.835]  Folks, tens of thousands of Nazis were brought to this country and they weren't just protected.
[01:01:53.146 --> 01:02:15.655]  They were given the head jobs over hundreds of federal departments and federal sub-departments from NASA to bioweapons programs to counter-espionage and interrogation methods.
[01:02:18.277 --> 01:02:19.297]  This has all come out.
[01:02:20.618 --> 01:02:23.979]  We don't even need the CIA to release more as we find out more.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:36.824]  My late grandfather told me that when he was a leasehound working for Magnolia Oil Company and then after that Sun Oil and then Exxon, I forget.
[01:02:37.324 --> 01:02:41.626]  But he lived all over New Mexico and South Texas, West Texas.
[01:02:42.506 --> 01:02:48.168]  So many of these military bases and even non-military bases out in Midland, Texas where the bushes were at.
[01:02:49.169 --> 01:02:49.509]  Nazis
[01:02:50.939 --> 01:02:51.459]  Everywhere!
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.941]  Just all over the place.
[01:02:57.241 --> 01:02:59.782]  And being protected.
[01:03:01.063 --> 01:03:07.705]  And helping form and mold our modern intelligence agencies.
[01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:12.087]  And again, not just the intelligence agencies, across the board.
[01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:14.712]  So we'll talk about this later in the hour.
[01:03:15.312 --> 01:03:17.454]  And there's a bunch of other news I want to get to.
[01:03:17.474 --> 01:03:21.617]  The Bilderberg Group planned spring scheming sessions out of American Free Press.
[01:03:22.438 --> 01:03:24.280]  Also, the Davos World Economic Forum.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:28.843]  We always learn a lot from them about what's going to be happening economically in the next few years.
[01:03:29.744 --> 01:03:30.325]  And much more.
[01:03:30.405 --> 01:03:37.911]  But first, when we get back, Katherine Ulbricht with some new developments concerning RFID and the tracking chips.
[01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:40.133]  So you do not want to miss this.
[01:03:40.925 --> 01:03:45.614]  After this quick break, and the toll-free number to join us on-air, 1-800-25599231, the website's InfoWars.com.
[01:03:53.559 --> 01:04:00.385]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.705 --> 01:04:02.087]  That's right, folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.287 --> 01:04:04.489]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.649 --> 01:04:06.731]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.011 --> 01:04:11.935]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.275 --> 01:04:16.319]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.559 --> 01:04:18.321]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.401 --> 01:04:29.073]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.213 --> 01:04:31.096]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:35.140]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today and man the guns of the InfoWars.
[01:04:35.260 --> 01:04:36.822]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[01:04:36.842 --> 01:04:37.222]  That's 888-2533139.
[01:04:37.242 --> 01:04:39.664]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:04:39.684 --> 01:04:40.906]  Again, that number, 888-2533139.
[01:04:52.785 --> 01:04:56.067]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.107 --> 01:05:00.289]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.549 --> 01:05:03.331]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.531 --> 01:05:05.932]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.112 --> 01:05:14.757]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:14.957 --> 01:05:16.298]  The Berkeley Light is different.
[01:05:16.498 --> 01:05:20.640]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:20.660 --> 01:05:21.300]  We're good to go.
[01:05:49.778 --> 01:05:51.047]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.753 --> 01:06:00.255]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:06:00.655 --> 01:06:04.896]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:06:05.116 --> 01:06:12.158]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:12.538 --> 01:06:18.640]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:18.780 --> 01:06:20.000]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:23.284]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:23.444 --> 01:06:25.486]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:25.787 --> 01:06:33.015]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:06:33.316 --> 01:06:36.720]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.202]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:06:40.222 --> 01:06:40.262]  866-885-6625.
[01:06:40.282 --> 01:06:40.382]  866-885-6625.
[01:06:40.623 --> 01:06:41.563]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:41.783]  Call today.
[01:06:41.803 --> 01:06:42.204]  Big Brother.
[01:06:42.224 --> 01:06:43.064]  Mainstream Media.
[01:07:01.127 --> 01:07:03.008]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:07:03.088 --> 01:07:03.389]  until 2 p.m.
[01:07:03.409 --> 01:07:05.350]  Central Standard Time.
[01:07:05.370 --> 01:07:09.873]  We're here live, folks, then back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[01:07:09.893 --> 01:07:11.394]  Thank you so much.
[01:07:31.112 --> 01:07:31.812]  We're joining us.
[01:07:33.173 --> 01:07:36.115]  Mike, William, Harry, Kim, all of you, your calls are coming up.
[01:07:37.096 --> 01:07:41.518]  Right now, we're joined by Catherine Albrecht from there at Harvard.
[01:07:42.319 --> 01:07:43.639]  And she has done so much.
[01:07:44.060 --> 01:07:49.823]  First, years ago, getting involved exposing these grocery store loyalty cards.
[01:07:51.696 --> 01:08:03.806]  Where they give you supposedly this big discount if you scan your card, then they've been caught selling the data to the federal government and other groups and you get junk mail in your mailbox according to what your purchases are.
[01:08:05.267 --> 01:08:05.927]  It's incredible!
[01:08:06.968 --> 01:08:20.019]  And then she found out about RFID chips, the federal plan to put these in every product in America and track and trace what we do, to have face scanning cameras in the grocery store scanning us as we pick up products, following us, watching what we do,
[01:08:21.377 --> 01:08:29.764]  It's a nightmarish system, having these chips put in when they're manufactured, then to the warehouse, then to the store, then to your home, following it, then to the landfill.
[01:08:30.505 --> 01:08:31.606]  These are the official plans.
[01:08:31.886 --> 01:08:35.609]  She's been to many of their different big industry meetings.
[01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:45.778]  And years ago, Walmart and the Defense Department said, we're going to tell all our suppliers, you've got to have RFID in your goods, or we're not going to buy from you.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:48.880]  And then,
[01:08:51.093 --> 01:08:57.855]  On top of that, they began to try to make the public schools put them in.
[01:08:57.875 --> 01:08:59.676]  I mean, it's just happening everywhere.
[01:09:00.996 --> 01:09:05.918]  And there's been new developments here at the frontier of the high-tech police state.
[01:09:06.438 --> 01:09:09.479]  And joining us with the headlines, Caspian uncovers U.S.
[01:09:09.499 --> 01:09:11.839]  government RFID promotion scheme.
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:16.461]  Heads of federal agencies encouraged to advance the industry.
[01:09:17.202 --> 01:09:21.904]  This is part of the plan to replace the barcode and just several other big developments.
[01:09:22.404 --> 01:09:23.984]  And Catherine, good to have you on with us.
[01:09:24.264 --> 01:09:25.565]  Hey Alex, always a pleasure.
[01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:29.206]  Yeah, we've got some big news out in RFID land.
[01:09:29.246 --> 01:09:31.347]  Of course, there's the headline that you just read.
[01:09:31.367 --> 01:09:33.147]  This is a press release we just sent out.
[01:09:33.868 --> 01:09:46.612]  We uncovered a document from the GSA, that's a federal agency called the General Services Administration, one you don't hear much about because their primary function is to buy stuff for other federal agencies.
[01:09:47.374 --> 01:09:52.870]  And we sent a document dated December 4th titled B7 Radio Frequency Identification.
[01:09:53.522 --> 01:10:10.373]  And in this document, it encourages heads of federal agencies to, quote, encourage to consider action that can be taken to advance the RFID industry by demonstrating the long-term intent of the agency to adopt RFID technological solutions.
[01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:21.200]  In addition, the document specifies that agencies, quote, need to determine how to best implement RFID technology on current or proposed contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements.
[01:10:21.693 --> 01:10:39.637]  So, in essence, what's happened is the GSA, for reasons that are a bit curious to us, has essentially sent this bulletin, this directive, out to all the heads of all of the federal agencies saying, basically, you guys need to scramble and support the RFID industry by buying their stuff.
[01:10:40.197 --> 01:10:50.380]  And since that time, when this was issued in the beginning of December, actually, we just came across it, no publicity on it, quietly dropped out into the Federal Register in December.
[01:10:51.366 --> 01:11:01.897]  Since that time, we have seen new RFID initiatives announced by the Social Security Administration, who's going to be using it to track Social Security files within their filing network.
[01:11:02.357 --> 01:11:07.082]  It's going to be used by the Postal Service, who is putting it on its vehicles and assets.
[01:11:07.542 --> 01:11:12.127]  And the Postal Service, of course, has been talking about putting it on stamps so that they would be able to track
[01:11:12.572 --> 01:11:17.054]  Individual pieces of mail and link information to an individual piece of mail.
[01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:20.775]  You've got initiatives announced by NASA of all things.
[01:11:21.235 --> 01:11:32.740]  Homeland Security now wanting to put RFID on a form of internal passport for visitors to this country where they would actually be... And they're going to put it in the passport to leave the country.
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:40.143]  And Ridge, two weeks ago when he was in England, called for a World ID card with a biometric and a tracker chip
[01:11:40.984 --> 01:11:46.213]  Uh, uh, imprint on it so a world standard and they passed a law a month and a half ago
[01:11:47.268 --> 01:12:11.693]  in congress uh... to federalize the state driver's license under federal control so first it goes federalized and internationalized it's all happening and what years ago the wal-mart and the defense department said told their suppliers you better start using this so we have the government with wal-mart trying to force a shift over to this technology we have the feds involved in trying to control the entire economic
[01:12:12.893 --> 01:12:19.615]  We just launched, by the way, Alex, a big boycott of the world's third biggest grocery retailer, a company called Tesco, out of the UK.
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:42.761]  They're all across Europe and Asia.
[01:12:43.401 --> 01:12:50.844]  This is a very big time for RFID and retail because they have this big annual convention called the National Retail Federation Convention out of New York every year.
[01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:54.565]  That's when they get together and they show off all of their new technology.
[01:12:55.305 --> 01:13:02.468]  Last year I think they spent about a million dollars to show off that RFID Future Store where, as you may recall, I went over there and found out that they had hidden
[01:13:02.928 --> 01:13:04.590]  Let me stop you, Catherine.
[01:13:04.610 --> 01:13:07.132]  I'm making a film about Nazis in our government.
[01:13:07.492 --> 01:13:11.455]  And that's about a third of this martial law film I'm making that I shot in New York.
[01:13:32.182 --> 01:13:41.928]  I knew that IBM was involved with the Nazis, but I've even learned more now, and I'm talking computer world, Associated Press, this stuff all came out but nobody ever heard about it.
[01:13:42.769 --> 01:13:46.951]  IBM actually had technicians in Germany at the death camps.
[01:13:48.952 --> 01:13:56.117]  The tattooing of the skin was the number to be put into the IBM system
[01:13:57.106 --> 01:14:01.388]  Uh, to then track the people and decide how much to feed them, or were they too old to keep alive?
[01:14:02.028 --> 01:14:10.111]  All of this, and then I found mainstream photos of Mr. Watson, the owner of IBM, the founder of IBM, having dinner with Adolf Hitler.
[01:14:11.131 --> 01:14:13.132]  Uh, you know, in 1939 and stuff.
[01:14:13.692 --> 01:14:21.835]  And then I see IBM really owning, or controlling, Applied Digital Solutions, the implantable microchip company.
[01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:22.175]  I see
[01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:26.713]  IBM being a prime mover in the RFID.
[01:14:26.873 --> 01:14:32.837]  I see them above all these different front companies as a prime mover, so it's almost like it's a repeat of history.
[01:14:33.298 --> 01:14:34.218]  Well, it's extraordinary, Alex.
[01:14:34.258 --> 01:14:40.804]  In fact, in our last newsletter, we sent out yet another thing that IBM is getting very involved in, and that is customer tracking.
[01:14:41.024 --> 01:14:51.592]  There's a field called customer relationship management, which are the people that collect information about all of your commercial transactions and sell them and traffic them to other companies, and that's why you get junk mail and why you get
[01:14:52.051 --> 01:14:52.211]  I think?
[01:15:10.785 --> 01:15:22.539]  So now not only can they track you and everywhere you go, but they want to use that information to link you up in their database with other people that you associate with, so that by looking up one person you can get a whole list of their network of associates.
[01:15:23.027 --> 01:15:30.932]  And one of the reasons they want to do that is so if you go to a store to return something, there's a new trend that if you return too many products, they'll simply refuse to take your return.
[01:15:30.972 --> 01:15:34.974]  Even if you have a receipt and the thing's in the package and it's in great shape, they won't take it back.
[01:15:35.334 --> 01:15:38.236]  So some people have turned to having friends return their things for them.
[01:15:38.396 --> 01:15:39.937]  If you could understand, I'd do the same.
[01:15:40.417 --> 01:15:48.262]  And now this company that IBM just bought up specializes in being able to detect that kind of thing and know if you're the friend of someone who returns too many things.
[01:15:50.183 --> 01:15:59.926]  So they're using this digital algorithm to then be able to identify whole networks of people.
[01:16:00.306 --> 01:16:00.747]  Exactly.
[01:16:01.247 --> 01:16:09.009]  And we've come across some IBM information that the company is actually now doing very bizarre video.
[01:16:09.469 --> 01:16:12.050]  You know those surveillance cameras you think are there to catch thieves?
[01:16:12.608 --> 01:16:20.195]  They've now, thanks to the help of IBM and other companies, they've found ways to actually lock on to an individual using that video camera.
[01:16:20.235 --> 01:16:23.719]  Well they lock on to the, according to USA Today, they lock on to your eye.
[01:16:23.739 --> 01:16:29.965]  You don't know what camera is scanning your eye, and it tracks what grid you're looking at, what product you're looking at.
[01:16:30.545 --> 01:16:40.368]  And then when you get to the register, it flags you according to an ID number if you have the loyalty card, and then sends junk mail, that's how I heard it described by USA Today, to your mailbox.
[01:16:40.728 --> 01:16:47.751]  They have what, the pressure plates on the floor, all of this, a building quote, a psychological profile on you.
[01:16:47.871 --> 01:16:48.611]  That's it.
[01:16:48.631 --> 01:16:49.091]  That's it.
[01:16:49.171 --> 01:16:54.593]  Well, IBM is one of the key leaders in that technology today, and they've got some demo
[01:16:57.062 --> 01:16:57.803]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:17:12.137 --> 01:17:21.066]  You know, one of the things I've noticed about the serum industry, because they've been so far off the radar screen of the average American consumer, they really don't make a point of hiding what they're doing.
[01:17:21.086 --> 01:17:28.234]  I mean, they are out there in the open, and they will say, we specifically, we sent out something else in our last newsletter that talked about how they want to milk consumers.
[01:17:28.254 --> 01:17:28.915]  They literally said,
[01:17:29.675 --> 01:17:33.759]  Milk your best consumers for everything they've got, and they're sending this out in open email.
[01:17:33.779 --> 01:17:37.262]  I mean, it's just, it's open, it's right there for anybody to look at.
[01:17:37.362 --> 01:17:38.263]  It's extraordinary.
[01:17:38.523 --> 01:17:40.605]  Yeah, they use really weird terminology.
[01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:43.428]  What was it, last year you were up in Chicago at one of these RFID...
[01:17:44.595 --> 01:17:50.398]  conventions and they were calling it the angel system, Babylon system, all this weird stuff.
[01:17:50.478 --> 01:17:54.660]  They wanted RFID evangelists and they were referring to it as the Holy Grail.
[01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:57.701]  There's a lot of religious terminology associated with this too.
[01:17:57.761 --> 01:17:59.862]  And they talked about some Babylon thing too.
[01:17:59.922 --> 01:18:03.344]  Yep, there's Babylon and there's Goliath systems that just got brought out.
[01:18:03.604 --> 01:18:05.785]  They're related to the RFID industry.
[01:18:05.805 --> 01:18:08.466]  So yeah, there's also a lot of kind of bizarre terminology.
[01:18:08.506 --> 01:18:11.788]  And you know, a brief visit to their website, it's all dark imagery
[01:18:12.922 --> 01:18:24.751]  You'll see on Alien Technology, they've got a... First of all, if the name weren't bad enough to call your company Alien Technology when you're selling RFID tags, their symbol looks like a bunch of claw marks.
[01:18:24.791 --> 01:18:29.955]  To me, it's really a very disturbing, sort of dark... What's wrong with some bloody claw marks?
[01:18:30.675 --> 01:18:32.217]  These are nice people!
[01:18:33.618 --> 01:18:35.819]  Well, I wish I shared your optimism there.
[01:18:35.839 --> 01:18:36.180]  I don't know.
[01:18:39.763 --> 01:18:45.989]  Probably the creepiest company of all, of course, Alex, and this is one we've talked about quite a bit, is Applied Digital Solutions, their implant.
[01:18:46.430 --> 01:18:47.811]  Let's talk about that when we get back, Catherine.
[01:18:48.291 --> 01:18:48.932]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:48.952 --> 01:18:49.673]  We'll talk about that.
[01:18:49.693 --> 01:18:51.715]  We'll start opening the phones up to your calls as well.
[01:18:52.115 --> 01:18:52.496]  Stay with us.
[01:18:54.534 --> 01:19:00.797]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, here to introduce to you a product that will put the peps back in your step.
[01:19:01.017 --> 01:19:06.000]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:19.466]  Lack of energy, lack of sleep, lack of strength, lack of stamina, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the spouse, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[01:19:19.706 --> 01:19:22.948]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all these things and more.
[01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:25.590]  Introducing the incredible Life Wave Patch.
[01:19:25.770 --> 01:19:29.612]  It's safe, non-invasive, and currently being used by world-renowned athletes.
[01:19:29.812 --> 01:19:32.875]  Olympic, professional, collegiate, high school, and little league alike.
[01:19:33.115 --> 01:19:36.617]  The Life Wave Patch has even been shown to help with jet lag and related issues.
[01:19:36.897 --> 01:19:40.980]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition, or just trying to beat the clock.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:43.502]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.
[01:19:43.682 --> 01:19:47.044]  Go to www.lifewavepromotions.com.
[01:19:47.304 --> 01:19:50.787]  Again, that's www.lifewavepromotions.com.

[01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.383]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:20:00.783 --> 01:20:01.664]  It still is!
[01:20:02.264 --> 01:20:05.766]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:20:06.106 --> 01:20:07.907]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:20:08.448 --> 01:20:10.509]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:20:11.064 --> 01:20:13.085]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:20:13.465 --> 01:20:21.127]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:20:21.507 --> 01:20:25.288]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.
[01:20:25.968 --> 01:20:30.949]  Call this toll-free number for your free investing and precious metals kit.

[01:20:49.543 --> 01:20:56.665]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:20:57.265 --> 01:21:06.467]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[01:21:07.432 --> 01:21:14.237]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[01:21:15.137 --> 01:21:16.579]  Is this what Americans want?
[01:21:16.819 --> 01:21:19.881]  To be merged into a communist-style one-world government?
[01:21:20.862 --> 01:21:29.368]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:30.248 --> 01:21:31.809]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736
[01:21:37.805 --> 01:21:43.530]  That's 1-800-516-87-36.

[01:21:54.361 --> 01:21:57.345]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:21:57.705 --> 01:22:06.535]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:22:06.855 --> 01:22:11.541]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:22:12.001 --> 01:22:18.725]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:22:19.125 --> 01:22:30.912]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:22:31.372 --> 01:22:35.834]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:22:35.994 --> 01:22:38.435]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:22:38.475 --> 01:22:40.316]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:22:40.336 --> 01:22:41.536]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:22:41.596 --> 01:22:43.057]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:22:43.077 --> 01:22:44.137]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:23:02.190 --> 01:23:08.874]  Just about 20 minutes ago, Hillary Clinton was at the Saturn Club in Buffalo, New York, about to give a speech.
[01:23:09.414 --> 01:23:12.515]  She has collapsed and been rushed to the hospital.
[01:23:12.836 --> 01:23:17.138]  So she didn't just faint, or maybe she did just faint, they took her to the hospital, but it doesn't sound good.
[01:23:18.158 --> 01:23:20.940]  But we hope that the conservative senators are doing well.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:25.182]  Again, if you're for gun control and open borders in the UN, you're conservative.
[01:23:25.859 --> 01:23:28.402]  She's for the war, too, so we're going to start calling her conservative.
[01:23:28.442 --> 01:23:29.223]  We're liberal here.
[01:23:29.263 --> 01:23:31.005]  We're against all those things.
[01:23:31.465 --> 01:23:32.967]  And maybe she choked on a pretzel.
[01:23:34.648 --> 01:23:38.833]  But who knows what's really going on here.
[01:23:40.154 --> 01:23:41.816]  Must be a high-stress job.
[01:23:41.856 --> 01:23:42.897]  Katherine, heard anything about
[01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:45.854]  Hillary falling down?
[01:23:45.874 --> 01:23:57.877]  You know, I haven't, but I'm sure that if the folks in our federal government had their way, Hillary Clinton would probably be RFID chipped right along with the rest of us, and we could just go online and figure out exactly where she is at the moment.
[01:23:58.117 --> 01:24:00.998]  Well, that would be C. That's a good reason that we should all have chips.
[01:24:01.038 --> 01:24:09.600]  Now, I had you on a few weeks ago when we had some of the Applied Digital Solutions distributors on, telling us how great the RFID chip is.
[01:24:10.301 --> 01:24:12.487]  And more and more evidence has come out mainstream.
[01:24:12.527 --> 01:24:15.575]  Even the FDA has said these things are dangerous under the skin.
[01:24:16.326 --> 01:24:37.417]  Well yeah, you know the FDA raised a letter that said the potential risk to health associated with taking an Averachip or any sort of radiofrequency implant device include adverse tissue reaction, migration of implanted transponder, compromised information security, failure of implanted transponder, failure of inserter, failure of electronic scanner.
[01:24:37.777 --> 01:24:45.261]  Here's my favorites, electromagnetic interference, electrical hazards, and MRI incompatibility.
[01:24:45.953 --> 01:24:51.894]  So what this means is, you know, it's so funny because the people who promote this technology like to refer to it as inert.
[01:24:52.254 --> 01:24:54.035]  You know, it's a little inert capsule of glass.
[01:24:54.075 --> 01:24:54.875]  What could go wrong?
[01:24:55.295 --> 01:24:57.076]  Well, nothing could be further from the truth.
[01:24:57.156 --> 01:25:02.257]  This is actually a highly reactive piece of electromagnetic equipment.
[01:25:02.697 --> 01:25:07.178]  Its whole purpose is to amplify electromagnetic radio waves in the environment.
[01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:09.501]  In fact, that's how an RFID tag works.
[01:25:09.601 --> 01:25:18.646]  It picks up electromagnetic energy from the reader device, amplifies it, sends it to the chip, and gets chipped to send back its unique identity information.
[01:25:18.986 --> 01:25:23.348]  So now imagine, Alex, that you get a little too much electromagnetic energy.
[01:25:23.809 --> 01:25:35.835]  What happens if you take, and people can try this as an experiment, although I don't want to take liability for it, but if you take one of those AOL CDs that you get in the mail, and you put it in your microwave for just two or three seconds,
[01:25:36.647 --> 01:25:40.673]  You'll hear a little crackle, and when you take it out, it'll look like popcorn on the inside.
[01:25:40.714 --> 01:25:45.681]  The outside will be smooth, but the inside will be completely turned into mangled metal.
[01:25:46.382 --> 01:25:49.708]  The same thing happens when you put an RFID tag in a microwave oven.
[01:25:49.728 --> 01:25:50.429]  It blows it out.
[01:25:51.055 --> 01:26:01.904]  So if you're anywhere near that kind of emission, and you have one of these things in your body, it will crackle, it will heat up, it can potentially burn you, it can potentially even explode.
[01:26:02.224 --> 01:26:13.994]  But Catherine, almost every day I see news articles about how great it would be if we all got chips, and how it's positive, and how this is the next phase, and the military's own documents say they want this for all the troops.
[01:26:14.494 --> 01:26:19.238]  I mean, isn't it freedom to have the government and media promoting that we all get chips?
[01:26:20.979 --> 01:26:29.805]  I don't know about that kind of freedom, but I think that one of the things that has not really come to the surface in talking about this is its compatibility with MRI.
[01:26:31.065 --> 01:26:40.271]  You know, when the FDA approved this back in October for medical use in patients, the idea is that you wouldn't have to wear a medical alert bracelet anymore.
[01:26:40.311 --> 01:26:42.352]  You could just have this thing implanted in your arm.
[01:26:42.672 --> 01:26:45.354]  Well, putting aside for the moment the fact that no emergency medical
[01:26:48.749 --> 01:26:52.811]  Well, people have been hurt and even killed before when metal flies across the room into the MRI.
[01:26:52.911 --> 01:27:05.115]  Exactly, and I think the most famous case was someone who an oxygen tank actually flew across the room into the MRI machine because that magnet is so powerful and it crushed a boy who was actually having an MRI test done.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:24.443]  In another case, a nurse opened the door to the MRI machine and had an MRI room with a pair of scissors in her hand.
[01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:29.024]  And the scissors literally flew out of her hand across the room into the machine and cut the patient.
[01:27:29.465 --> 01:27:35.407]  So now imagine a magnet that powerful and the piece of metal is now not in the nurse's hand, it's actually embedded in your arm.
[01:27:35.427 --> 01:27:37.708]  By the way, you raised this first a few months ago.
[01:27:37.728 --> 01:27:39.949]  Now the FDA says it's incompatible with an MRI.
[01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:40.389]  Right.
[01:27:41.065 --> 01:27:51.830]  And we've been in contact with a researcher who's done some research into this and found that at the very minimum, when you do go through an MRI machine, the device fails to function.
[01:27:51.850 --> 01:27:52.950]  It does blow out the chip.
[01:27:54.030 --> 01:27:58.712]  Oh, so, and again, something contained when it explodes has a lot more force.
[01:27:59.253 --> 01:28:01.474]  So imagine having one of these in you when it pops.
[01:28:02.054 --> 01:28:04.255]  Well, and that would be, you know,
[01:28:05.519 --> 01:28:14.542]  The bigger concern, if you've got a lot of people with these things implanted in them, let's say the military, the armed forces... An enemy can scan and know right where your troops are at!
[01:28:14.942 --> 01:28:16.742]  Well, not quite.
[01:28:16.802 --> 01:28:19.543]  These can only be read at a distance of about 18 inches.
[01:28:19.603 --> 01:28:21.364]  But that's what the small reader...
[01:28:23.237 --> 01:28:26.740]  If someone had a more powerful scanner, it could be read further away.
[01:28:27.421 --> 01:28:32.645]  Yeah, but even by further away, you're not going to get more than a couple of feet because of the way it works.
[01:28:32.765 --> 01:28:39.811]  But, what you could do would be plant invisible reader devices at key locations and identify people if they walked by in doorways.
[01:28:39.952 --> 01:28:42.474]  Stay there, we're going to come back and take a look.
[01:28:43.995 --> 01:28:44.876]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.376 --> 01:28:47.018]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.918 --> 01:28:50.601]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.716 --> 01:28:56.177]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:28:56.377 --> 01:29:03.722]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:29:04.042 --> 01:29:08.465]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:29:08.725 --> 01:29:18.551]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:29:19.311 --> 01:29:22.975]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:29:23.316 --> 01:29:25.798]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:29:26.119 --> 01:29:32.045]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:29:32.285 --> 01:29:33.907]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:29:34.127 --> 01:29:34.988]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:29:35.088 --> 01:29:37.050]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds
[01:29:37.310 --> 01:29:38.051]  Every year.
[01:29:38.212 --> 01:29:39.133]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:29:39.153 --> 01:29:39.333]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:29:39.393 --> 01:29:42.498]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:29:42.518 --> 01:29:43.460]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:29:54.238 --> 01:29:59.460]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:07.683]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:30:07.943 --> 01:30:15.005]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:30:15.185 --> 01:30:16.466]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:30:16.546 --> 01:30:22.429]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:30:22.629 --> 01:30:27.711]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:30:27.831 --> 01:30:36.716]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:30:36.976 --> 01:30:41.759]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium
[01:30:53.582 --> 01:30:57.783]  Whether it's fair or not, people judge you by the words you use.
[01:30:58.543 --> 01:31:06.805]  In business and socially, your vocabulary and language skills tell everyone about your background, education, even your intelligence.
[01:31:07.405 --> 01:31:09.146]  That's why you need Verbal Advantage.
[01:31:09.846 --> 01:31:10.446]  While you listen,

[01:31:16.444 --> 01:31:18.005]  No more fumbling for the right word.
[01:31:18.545 --> 01:31:20.706]  No more embarrassment at how to express yourself.
[01:31:21.286 --> 01:31:23.307]  No more fear of using the wrong word.
[01:31:23.888 --> 01:31:24.988]  And it's so easy.
[01:31:25.689 --> 01:31:27.710]  To learn, you simply listen.

[01:31:29.711 --> 01:31:30.331]  Where you want.
[01:31:31.151 --> 01:31:36.114]  See why over 100,000 people have already gotten the Verbal Advantage they need for success.
[01:31:36.986 --> 01:31:39.569]  To learn more about Verbal Advantage, call now.
[01:31:39.589 --> 01:31:39.649]  1-800-4400-4419.
[01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:40.650]  That's 419WORD.
[01:31:40.670 --> 01:31:40.730]  1-800-4400-19.
[01:32:03.517 --> 01:32:10.082]  Alright, Mike and William and Harvey and Kim and Troy and everybody else, your calls are coming up for Kathryn Albrecht.
[01:32:10.142 --> 01:32:14.745]  No matter what issue you bring up, it all ties back to tracking and tracing and Big Brother and the police state.
[01:32:15.185 --> 01:32:25.392]  Before we go back to Kathryn, listen, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove is a film that every American, every human, period, needs to have.
[01:32:26.413 --> 01:32:29.675]  Back in July of 2000, I snuck into the Bohemian Grove
[01:32:30.572 --> 01:32:34.954]  And caught our world leaders involved in their satanic ritual, the mullet.
[01:32:35.775 --> 01:32:37.035]  And it's been in the newspapers.
[01:32:37.095 --> 01:32:38.136]  It's admitted I snuck in.
[01:32:38.176 --> 01:32:39.737]  They admit I snuck in and got this video.
[01:32:40.397 --> 01:32:43.719]  It's like they admit that this video's been gotten as part of the Skull and Bones ritual.
[01:32:44.899 --> 01:32:51.242]  But we cover what our world leaders are really up to, what they really believe, the God that they truly serve.
[01:32:51.322 --> 01:32:56.025]  And the interesting thing is most of the people that go to Bohemian Grove are so-called Christian conservatives.
[01:32:57.385 --> 01:33:15.060]  All of those out there, like myself, who consider ourselves to be Christians, and who love Christ, and believe His promise, and take His offer, should really be concerned about this, because the devil comes as an angel of light, masquerading as an angel of light.
[01:33:15.881 --> 01:33:25.349]  And a lot of these people you see praying on TV and telling you how Christian they are, you look at the evidence of what they're actually doing, they're destroying America and bringing in a new world order system.
[01:33:26.010 --> 01:33:29.434]  Well, you'll understand why when you see Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:33:29.634 --> 01:33:32.497]  It's an amazing video and everybody needs to have it.
[01:33:33.318 --> 01:33:44.089]  You can go to PrisonPlanet.tv and for 15 cents a day, sign up for a month or a year membership, you can watch that film and 11 other of my videos and dozens of other great films people have made.
[01:33:44.972 --> 01:33:47.233]  You can watch my weekly TV show.
[01:33:47.614 --> 01:33:49.134]  Before, it was only available in Austin.
[01:33:49.635 --> 01:33:52.316]  It's won Best of Austin, by the way, twice in the Reader's Poll.
[01:33:52.817 --> 01:33:53.857]  So, it's pretty popular.
[01:33:54.718 --> 01:33:56.699]  It's a good little TV show.
[01:33:56.739 --> 01:33:59.160]  Some are better than others, but it's a lot of key information.
[01:33:59.681 --> 01:34:03.023]  That's all at PrisonPlanet.TV, a bunch of e-books, you name it.
[01:34:04.323 --> 01:34:10.807]  Or call toll-free to get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, or 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, or Matrix of Evil, or Masters of Terror.
[01:34:12.348 --> 01:34:13.889]  You need to have these films.
[01:34:14.714 --> 01:34:20.459]  1-888-258-253-3139 to order via the phone.
[01:34:20.499 --> 01:34:23.802]  Operators are there right now.
[01:34:23.822 --> 01:34:24.422]  888-253-3139.
[01:34:25.143 --> 01:34:27.285]  They can answer all your questions.
[01:34:27.825 --> 01:34:30.347]  Or go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:30.628 --> 01:34:32.729]  Link through the secure, safe online shopping cart.
[01:34:33.070 --> 01:34:35.752]  Still got just some insane deals going on my films.
[01:34:36.272 --> 01:34:37.493]  Some of them as low as $5.95 apiece.
[01:34:37.533 --> 01:34:40.576]  You're not going to find them any... I mean, that's ridiculous.
[01:34:41.784 --> 01:34:48.471]  I want to get into some of the new RFID and Big Brother period developments with one of the preeminent experts on the globe, Kathryn Albrecht.
[01:35:02.685 --> 01:35:03.666]  We do that, Catherine.
[01:35:03.706 --> 01:35:07.529]  Tell folks about a couple videos you've made about RFID.
[01:35:08.050 --> 01:35:10.252]  Well, absolutely, Alex, and thanks for bringing them up.
[01:35:10.452 --> 01:35:23.304]  A while back I was flown to Indiana by the good folks at End Time Ministries, and I had done many radio interviews with them in the past, and they said, listen, give us everything you know.
[01:35:23.384 --> 01:35:24.365]  Lay it out for us.
[01:35:24.445 --> 01:35:28.989]  Lay it out for our audience so that we're going to have a big crowd together, and we want to know what you know.
[01:35:29.531 --> 01:35:39.795]  And I have spent quite a bit of time putting together images and a presentation of really the state-of-the-art of knowledge about RFID for an audience that really did not have the background.
[01:35:40.415 --> 01:35:44.417]  And that video is called RFID Tracking Everything Everywhere.
[01:35:44.437 --> 01:35:48.799]  They make it available through their website at endtime.com or through 1-800-ENDTIME.
[01:35:52.305 --> 01:35:59.627]  And it's really a fantastic overview, if I say so myself, of the RFID issue, kind of from the ground up.
[01:35:59.707 --> 01:36:07.710]  It gives you a picture of what this plan is, where it came from, gives you many images of RFID tags hidden in... This is a big deal.
[01:36:07.770 --> 01:36:09.990]  This is already replacing the barcode.
[01:36:10.350 --> 01:36:11.791]  Everything you do will be tracked and traced.
[01:36:11.851 --> 01:36:12.531]  It's so serious.
[01:36:12.911 --> 01:36:14.512]  Also, give us your websites.
[01:36:14.532 --> 01:36:15.492]  There's so much information.
[01:36:15.692 --> 01:36:16.193]  Absolutely.
[01:36:16.313 --> 01:36:23.222]  Our main RFID website is at spychips.com.
[01:36:23.502 --> 01:36:28.889]  We also have a website that takes a look at the shopper card issue at nocards.org.
[01:36:31.337 --> 01:36:37.921]  And then if you're a Gillette Razor user, I advise you to think twice because Gillette is one of the biggest companies behind all of this.
[01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:41.523]  They were actually one of the co-founders of the whole industry consortium that cooks.
[01:36:41.583 --> 01:36:43.163]  And they do the smart shelving.
[01:36:43.183 --> 01:36:47.726]  You've caught them at Walmart where you go up to get Gillette products and secret cameras are scanning you.
[01:36:48.146 --> 01:36:48.586]  That's right.
[01:36:48.606 --> 01:36:54.209]  So if you go to BoycottGillette.com, we have all of the images of the shelves, we have all of the information.
[01:36:54.229 --> 01:37:00.271]  There's even a link to video where you can see how they were taking pictures up close, mug shots of people as they picked up Gillette products.
[01:37:00.291 --> 01:37:01.292]  Digital face skins.
[01:37:01.792 --> 01:37:02.712]  Yeah, scary stuff.
[01:37:03.072 --> 01:37:07.614]  So all of that is available and it's all linked from our Spychips.com website.
[01:37:07.774 --> 01:37:08.555]  Alright, good.
[01:37:08.595 --> 01:37:09.555]  Let's take calls here.
[01:37:09.615 --> 01:37:11.136]  This will be all over the map, but that's fine.
[01:37:11.696 --> 01:37:13.237]  I'm sure Catherine can respond to anything.
[01:37:14.077 --> 01:37:15.197]  Mike in Maryland.
[01:37:15.277 --> 01:37:15.918]  Welcome, Mike.
[01:37:15.938 --> 01:37:16.418]  Go ahead.
[01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:20.019]  I really feel privileged and honored to call in on your show.
[01:37:20.659 --> 01:37:23.860]  And I've got several of your tapes, Mr. Jones and Ms.
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:24.280]  Albrecht.
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.581]  I've got your two tapes.
[01:37:26.141 --> 01:37:27.762]  And they're all out on loan to people.
[01:37:27.882 --> 01:37:29.862]  I try to spread the word as much as possible.
[01:37:29.902 --> 01:37:31.043]  Well, God bless you, sir.
[01:37:31.423 --> 01:37:37.565]  And I have friends in the survivalist slash patriot movement that say I shouldn't make myself vulnerable.
[01:37:38.045 --> 01:37:39.386]  I shouldn't go up to strangers.
[01:37:40.939 --> 01:37:42.300]  Because somebody may turn me in.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.842]  Well, I want to respond to this.
[01:37:44.022 --> 01:37:45.844]  Number one, we're not doing anything wrong.
[01:37:46.304 --> 01:37:48.246]  The globalists are the bad people.
[01:37:48.286 --> 01:37:49.067]  They ought to be afraid.
[01:37:49.487 --> 01:37:53.311]  Number two, we all make ourselves vulnerable by not fighting this.
[01:37:53.371 --> 01:37:55.934]  This system is affecting and attacking.
[01:37:55.954 --> 01:37:57.275]  You can serve this system.
[01:37:57.575 --> 01:38:00.017]  They're going to take your pension fund, take your social security.
[01:38:00.317 --> 01:38:01.858]  You can serve this new world order.
[01:38:02.018 --> 01:38:04.120]  They're going to put cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:05.901]  You can serve this new world order.
[01:38:06.221 --> 01:38:07.762]  They're going to put garbage in your water.
[01:38:08.222 --> 01:38:11.545]  They're going to put aspartame in over 9,000 foods.
[01:38:11.625 --> 01:38:18.870]  This system is evil across the board, and it isn't like everyone in government is this evil Nosferatu coming to get you.
[01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:24.734]  If we are cowed by this and let them act like all this is normal, then they'll get their plan in.
[01:38:25.234 --> 01:38:30.341]  So these people that are just running scared, they better be running scared because they're cowardice.
[01:38:30.661 --> 01:38:31.723]  They're hiding out.
[01:38:31.963 --> 01:38:33.425]  Oh, I'm going to take care of myself.
[01:38:33.705 --> 01:38:36.069]  They've ensured that they're going to let the system win.
[01:38:36.289 --> 01:38:38.652]  I want Catherine to comment, you know, on this.
[01:38:38.672 --> 01:38:39.974]  Well, I won't do anything.
[01:38:40.174 --> 01:38:41.536]  They'll come get me.
[01:38:41.676 --> 01:38:42.377]  Catherine, go ahead.
[01:38:42.697 --> 01:38:43.478]  Well, you know, it's funny.
[01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:48.861]  I've been working on this since 1999, and like so many people out there, I initially got started.
[01:38:48.901 --> 01:38:50.302]  I was on somebody's mailing list.
[01:38:50.362 --> 01:38:51.362]  I was getting these emails.
[01:38:51.402 --> 01:38:55.184]  I was becoming informed, and I said, you know, I really want to do something about this.
[01:38:55.825 --> 01:39:03.509]  And, you know, I think the key is for if everybody picked an issue that they thought was important and really worked on it, that's how I've gotten where I am today.
[01:39:03.529 --> 01:39:05.190]  I mean, I picked the issue of supermarket cars.
[01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:06.671]  I said, nobody else is working on this.
[01:39:07.071 --> 01:39:08.112]  It's very important.
[01:39:08.212 --> 01:39:11.174]  And by rolling up my sleeves, we've really had a big impact.
[01:39:11.614 --> 01:39:13.234]  on public opinion about those cards.
[01:39:13.274 --> 01:39:22.016]  Do you know back in 1999, Alex, when I first started Caspian, they did annual surveys of the most trusted businesses in the country, and you know who always came out on the top?
[01:39:22.296 --> 01:39:22.956]  Supermarkets.
[01:39:23.796 --> 01:39:27.977]  Now, since I've been doing this work for the last five years, now they come out at the bottom.
[01:39:28.817 --> 01:39:35.139]  So that's... I've probably been in grocery store lines four or five times the last year and heard people mention your website.
[01:39:35.559 --> 01:39:36.499]  Oh, I'm glad to hear it.
[01:39:36.519 --> 01:39:37.619]  Can I ask you a question?
[01:39:37.639 --> 01:39:38.439]  Yeah, go ahead, sir.
[01:39:38.499 --> 01:39:41.200]  Yeah, I appreciate that, and like I say, I've got a bunch of your tapes.
[01:39:42.312 --> 01:39:43.953]  And I got the two tapes from Ms.
[01:39:44.013 --> 01:39:48.955]  Albrecht, and the only thing that makes you mad is when people sit on them for several weeks or months, and they can't recirculate them.
[01:39:49.275 --> 01:40:00.719]  But everything that's happening to this country, especially in the past couple years, is like an amalgamation of 1984, Brave New World, Rollerball, and God forbid, ultimately, maybe Soy and Green.
[01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:04.581]  But a cherry on top is Revelation.
[01:40:04.841 --> 01:40:06.261]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:06.341 --> 01:40:10.263]  And it's like, I mean, I feel compelled to tell people, tell people the work
[01:40:11.255 --> 01:40:15.157]  And it's like these 9 or 10 year old kids getting arrested.
[01:40:17.117 --> 01:40:18.118]  We're drawing on those pictures.
[01:40:18.198 --> 01:40:21.939]  Is this coming down from up top or are these policemen taking it upon themselves?
[01:40:22.259 --> 01:40:23.940]  No, this is coming down from on top.
[01:40:23.980 --> 01:40:33.584]  They get the state and federal funds to sign on to these guidelines where the valedictorian is going to bring some cake and cookies and has the paper
[01:40:37.526 --> 01:40:39.048]  What's the thing you put on top of the table?
[01:40:50.413 --> 01:40:54.236]  No, it's the thing that, you know, the white thing that covers the whole table.
[01:40:54.457 --> 01:40:55.277]  That's a tablecloth!
[01:40:55.478 --> 01:40:56.038]  Tablecloth!
[01:40:56.098 --> 01:40:57.259]  It's sometimes the most simple thing.
[01:40:57.339 --> 01:40:57.900]  I can't get it.
[01:40:58.220 --> 01:40:58.660]  Excuse me.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:12.232]  Yeah, she had the paper tablecloth, the little plastic box, you know, with the knives and the fork and the spoons, and they arrested her and took her diploma away because she had plastic knives.
[01:41:12.432 --> 01:41:17.597]  I mean, this is... Yeah, well, let me get a comment from Catherine about that.
[01:41:17.637 --> 01:41:17.957]  Catherine?
[01:41:18.562 --> 01:41:23.348]  Well, you know, the question being basically, where are these directives coming from?
[01:41:23.428 --> 01:41:25.972]  All I can speak to is what I do in the RFID world.
[01:41:26.577 --> 01:41:28.198]  And I'll give you a couple of examples.
[01:41:28.238 --> 01:41:34.261]  You know, the big announcement, Alex, that we didn't get to talk about is that Gillette is actually going to be bought by Procter & Gamble.
[01:41:34.281 --> 01:41:35.822]  This announcement just came out on Friday.
[01:41:36.242 --> 01:41:39.664]  And it will create the biggest consumer product manufacturing company on the planet.
[01:41:40.384 --> 01:41:48.688]  The reason they say they're doing it is because they want to be able to basically have a better negotiating position with Walmart, which is, of course, the biggest producer or the biggest retailer.
[01:41:48.728 --> 01:41:54.391]  So Walmart's driving this consolidation everywhere and saying, you will have RFID or we won't buy your product.
[01:41:54.471 --> 01:42:04.899]  Well, and what makes things even more interesting with this Gillette, Procter & Gamble merger, those two were the folks who put in millions of dollars back in 99 to start the Auto ID Center that created the whole RFID movement.
[01:42:04.939 --> 01:42:07.922]  Had it not been for that, we would not be even hearing about RFID.
[01:42:07.942 --> 01:42:12.866]  It wouldn't even exist today, at least not in its current form where they want to use it to replace the barcode.
[01:42:13.246 --> 01:42:19.910]  So now you've got the two biggest consumer product manufacturers on the globe getting together, and these are the two biggest backers of RFID.
[01:42:20.190 --> 01:42:22.811]  They're going to create the 1,200 pound gorilla.
[01:42:22.831 --> 01:42:28.474]  I mean, they're going to be absolutely, you know, extraordinarily powerful over our lives.
[01:42:28.534 --> 01:42:35.418]  And then they're going to control the whole RFID center and the infrastructure, and then all manufacturers will have to bow to them.
[01:42:35.678 --> 01:42:37.419]  This is really also about monopoly.
[01:42:37.899 --> 01:42:41.341]  Well, yes, and of course they have a very powerful position with retailers.
[01:42:41.381 --> 01:42:44.743]  You've got Wal-Mart influencing the consumer product companies.
[01:42:44.763 --> 01:42:47.565]  You've got Gillette and Procter & Gamble influencing the retailers.
[01:42:47.645 --> 01:42:48.946]  It's just a big mess.
[01:42:48.986 --> 01:42:54.669]  But to get back to your caller's question, Mike, the question is where do these mandates come from?
[01:42:55.109 --> 01:43:03.213]  Well, as I was looking through a list of Procter & Gamble products so I could stop buying them and begin to boycott them, one of them caught my eye and it was Iams Pet Food.
[01:43:03.433 --> 01:43:04.433]  You guys heard of Iams?
[01:43:04.473 --> 01:43:08.756]  They're sort of a high... Yeah, it's the high-end organic food for animals.
[01:43:08.796 --> 01:43:10.836]  They're very expensive and scientific, etc.
[01:43:10.917 --> 01:43:22.442]  And so these Iams folks had donated 30,000 RFID scanners to veterinarians around the country because only 5% of American animals are chipped pets, whereas in Europe that number is much, much higher.
[01:43:22.907 --> 01:43:25.869]  And they were saying they wanted Americans to catch up with Europeans.
[01:43:25.889 --> 01:43:31.291]  And I thought, now why would Iams Pet Food care one whit about whether our pets are chipped or not?
[01:43:31.331 --> 01:43:33.532]  All they care about is should be selling pet food.
[01:43:33.973 --> 01:43:39.455]  Well, when I did a little digging on this Procter & Gamble site, I found out that Procter & Gamble, big surprise, owns Iams.
[01:43:40.436 --> 01:43:42.057]  So here, once again, you get this
[01:43:42.896 --> 01:43:44.958]  You know, you're talking about mandates from the top.
[01:43:45.098 --> 01:44:05.396]  I'm sure that Procter & Gamble has said to all of its subsidiary companies, we want to see you promoting RFID at every turn in the same way that we opened up this interview talking about the federal government mandate from the GSA telling the head, not just the rank and file, but the head of every federal agency, get on board with RFID, support the industry, and make investments in this, and publicize them.
[01:44:05.416 --> 01:44:06.657]  Yeah, let's take another call.
[01:44:07.017 --> 01:44:08.158]  William in Oregon.
[01:44:08.178 --> 01:44:09.339]  William, you're on the air.
[01:44:09.380 --> 01:44:09.780]  Go ahead.
[01:44:10.228 --> 01:44:11.489]  Alex, a couple quick points.
[01:44:11.569 --> 01:44:14.730]  First of all, I want to thank you for your show on Coast to Coast.
[01:44:14.770 --> 01:44:19.572]  The other night, my mother, who's pressing 80, stayed up until 2 o'clock in the morning in San Diego and loved it.
[01:44:20.292 --> 01:44:21.712]  I also finally saw Waking Life.
[01:44:22.173 --> 01:44:22.633]  Wonderful.
[01:44:23.813 --> 01:44:31.456]  To get back to the RFID, which I'm glad to hear you talking about it, I found a link when I was doing some research on this Boeing deal with Saudi Arabia.
[01:44:31.476 --> 01:44:33.497]  I spoke to you about it a few months ago.
[01:44:34.366 --> 01:44:42.792]  I found a link that showed where Matrix Incorporated is actually being funded partially with the investment group of Carlisle's, which I thought was kind of an interesting footnote to that.
[01:44:42.812 --> 01:44:47.275]  And again, the Matrix Group is part of the Carlisle Group with this RFID chip.
[01:44:47.675 --> 01:44:49.337]  It looks like a swastika.
[01:44:49.357 --> 01:44:50.437]  Catherine, comments?
[01:44:50.798 --> 01:44:55.821]  Yeah, that's the one that they wanted to hide in people's loyalty cards so they could track them.
[01:44:55.921 --> 01:44:57.342]  Does it look like a swastika?
[01:44:57.362 --> 01:44:58.743]  I'm sorry, it is a swastika.
[01:44:58.763 --> 01:44:59.063]  Go ahead.
[01:45:00.024 --> 01:45:11.440]  The guy who handed me this matrix card actually was explaining that the reason it has two antennas is so that it can track the consumer no matter how it's oriented in their wallet or purse, whereas the ones with just one ID...
[01:45:12.191 --> 01:45:14.272]  If you turn them at a certain angle, they're hard to read.
[01:45:14.312 --> 01:45:15.752]  And this one could be read no matter what.
[01:45:15.792 --> 01:45:31.356]  So basically that... So now you're not only having to take a digital photo and run it through the database, now you've got it in your wallet while you're in the store, so while you get RFID items, it can continually be masked off readers hidden to what's in your wallet.
[01:45:31.736 --> 01:45:39.479]  Well, and the danger with putting these in people's wallets, of course, Alex, is that you could put a reader device anywhere, not just in the store doorway, but literally anywhere.
[01:45:39.819 --> 01:45:44.400]  But the store has no business when I walk in covertly scanning me.
[01:45:44.460 --> 01:45:51.323]  Well, they view you as their property, and they view the store as their property, and all they're doing is inventory control.
[01:45:51.423 --> 01:45:55.264]  And again, folks, there's a lot of these cards sandwiched in there, these chips, and nobody told you.
[01:45:55.544 --> 01:45:57.605]  What happened in Germany when they found out, Catherine?
[01:45:57.865 --> 01:46:10.871]  Well, you know, when I went over there to Germany, and it's interesting that you're doing this research on the Nazis, because I gave a privacy talk to a German privacy group in a converted underground Nazi bunker that had been turned into a nightclub cafe.
[01:46:11.471 --> 01:46:13.872]  Very strange to be underground in this place.
[01:46:14.132 --> 01:46:15.853]  It was all fortified against attack.
[01:46:15.873 --> 01:46:16.433]  Very bizarre.
[01:46:17.444 --> 01:46:21.207]  But I went on a three-hour tour of the RFID Industries Future Store.
[01:46:21.247 --> 01:46:24.429]  We outlined that on our website at spychips.com on the bottom left.
[01:46:24.449 --> 01:46:25.870]  You'll see a little 12-page tour.
[01:46:26.170 --> 01:46:30.234]  You can see me walking around and kicking the tires on all their RFID installations.
[01:46:30.814 --> 01:46:34.257]  And at the end, I obtained one of their loyalty cards.
[01:46:35.111 --> 01:46:36.692]  They were very uneasy giving it to us.
[01:46:36.732 --> 01:46:37.453]  They hemmed and hawed.
[01:46:37.473 --> 01:46:39.034]  They had to call back to the central office.
[01:46:39.074 --> 01:46:40.235]  And I thought, that's very weird.
[01:46:40.696 --> 01:46:46.300]  Well, the following day, I'm giving a presentation to a group of German privacy, you know, people concerned about privacy.
[01:46:46.701 --> 01:46:54.087]  And we were holding up things like Pantene shampoo and Kraft cream cheese up to the reader device to show that they had been RFID tagged.
[01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:59.291]  And sure enough, on the screen behind us, as I held up each product, you could see it's a unique ID number and all its information.
[01:46:59.771 --> 01:47:04.074]  And on a lark, somebody said, well, next they're going to be tagging us and putting them in our cards.
[01:47:04.094 --> 01:47:09.597]  And they picked up the card that I'd been given, held it up to the reader, and we all almost fell out of our seats.
[01:47:09.617 --> 01:47:12.459]  A number popped up, and sure enough, they had tagged us.
[01:47:12.619 --> 01:47:14.500]  They had put them right in the loyalty card.
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:16.441]  And IBM is involved, as usual.
[01:47:16.522 --> 01:47:21.525]  Well, IBM, again, IBM referred to the people of Rheinberg, Germany, as guinea pigs.
[01:47:21.665 --> 01:47:26.748]  Literally, in a press release, they said the people of Rheinberg will be guinea pigs for what the industry hopes is a standard.
[01:47:27.259 --> 01:47:31.283]  We had its technicians in Germany running the machines at the camps.
[01:47:32.124 --> 01:47:33.365]  Thanks for the call, William.
[01:47:33.945 --> 01:47:34.806]  Really great points.
[01:47:35.187 --> 01:47:37.549]  Harry, or Harvey, excuse me, in Florida.
[01:47:37.589 --> 01:47:38.249]  Go ahead, Harvey.
[01:47:38.490 --> 01:47:40.472]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex and Catherine.
[01:47:40.492 --> 01:47:41.993]  It's a pleasure to speak with you both.
[01:47:42.053 --> 01:47:44.215]  You're really great patriots.
[01:47:44.596 --> 01:47:45.256]  Nice to talk to you.
[01:47:45.276 --> 01:47:45.737]  What's on your mind?
[01:47:46.117 --> 01:47:49.280]  I thought of the IBM slogan, a great slogan for them to advertise.
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:50.321]  Milk the guinea pigs.
[01:47:51.304 --> 01:47:54.127]  Yeah, that'd be a good little IBM for the guinea pigs.
[01:47:54.147 --> 01:47:55.629]  Yeah, look, the guinea pigs.
[01:47:55.809 --> 01:48:00.714]  Those are two of the expressions that they use in public, and I thought of one now for Plotter and Gamble.
[01:48:01.214 --> 01:48:03.477]  Know the pet, know the people.
[01:48:04.774 --> 01:48:05.354]  Good point.
[01:48:05.594 --> 01:48:06.234]  Excellent point.
[01:48:06.475 --> 01:48:09.016]  And I'll say one other thing, just on a humorous note.
[01:48:09.656 --> 01:48:18.142]  One of our staffers here at Caspian, when they noticed that Procter & Gamble, which goes by P&G, was hooking up with Gillette, that their new nickname can be Piglet.
[01:48:18.162 --> 01:48:21.984]  Nice new acronym.
[01:48:22.464 --> 01:48:24.245]  Know the pet, know the people.
[01:48:26.804 --> 01:48:28.326]  It's so unbelievably sickening.
[01:48:28.346 --> 01:48:30.008]  Well, the agenda's clear.
[01:48:30.048 --> 01:48:32.830]  I mean, she just brought this up with IMES, promoting these chips.
[01:48:33.091 --> 01:48:37.195]  We've got signs up all over Austin suddenly going, microchipping works.
[01:48:37.736 --> 01:48:41.379]  And then real small under it, it says, get your pet chip today.
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:43.682]  Get chip today.
[01:48:43.742 --> 01:48:48.287]  That's the slogan of Applied Digital, is get chip today.
[01:48:49.512 --> 01:48:52.794]  It all comes down to if you have nothing to hide.
[01:48:52.934 --> 01:48:54.095]  That's the latest slogan.
[01:48:54.135 --> 01:48:55.876]  Why worry if you have nothing to hide?
[01:48:56.397 --> 01:48:56.897]  Absolutely.
[01:48:57.497 --> 01:48:59.379]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:59.399 --> 01:49:06.004]  A lot of people think you're getting a discount, too, with these customer loyalty cards, but they've got some nice little scams they run, don't they, Catherine?
[01:49:06.164 --> 01:49:06.624]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:06.864 --> 01:49:09.386]  My favorite is in Waco, Texas, of all places.
[01:49:09.426 --> 01:49:14.470]  We found them right after they introduced the Albertsons Preferred Customer Card in Texas.
[01:49:15.123 --> 01:49:22.535]  Uh, we caught them taking Velveeta, uh, Kraft Velveeta cheese that said right on the label, everyday low price $3.99.
[01:49:22.936 --> 01:49:28.946]  We found them pricing that everyday low price cheese at $5.99, but with a big sign saying $2 off with your card.
[01:49:30.861 --> 01:49:33.463]  Literally, right on the package, Kraft said the price should be $3.99.
[01:49:33.624 --> 01:49:36.967]  And then if you don't have it, they go ahead and overcharge you.
[01:49:37.147 --> 01:49:40.951]  Well, which was a 50% surcharge for not having the card.
[01:49:41.091 --> 01:49:46.776]  And if you did have the card, your $2 savings basically translated right back to the manufacturer's suggested retail price.
[01:49:46.816 --> 01:49:48.898]  There was no savings at all associated with that.
[01:49:49.699 --> 01:49:50.520]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:50.940]  Stay there.
[01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:51.421]  We'll be right back.

[01:53:06.540 --> 01:53:07.600]  All the police state.
[01:53:08.061 --> 01:53:10.442]  People say, oh I don't care if it's the police state, I've got the nine.
[01:53:10.843 --> 01:53:14.385]  They put it in always so they can then abuse you.
[01:53:14.726 --> 01:53:16.127]  Consolidate control.

[01:53:20.225 --> 01:53:22.506]  We've got loaded phone lines here for Catherine Albrecht tonight.
[01:53:22.566 --> 01:53:25.248]  I know she's got to go soon, but let's just keep going to them here.
[01:53:26.029 --> 01:53:30.191]  Let's talk to Kim in Texas, then Roy, Tim, and others.
[01:53:30.771 --> 01:53:31.512]  Go ahead, Kim.
[01:53:31.552 --> 01:53:32.112]  You're on the air.
[01:53:32.412 --> 01:53:36.615]  Well, Alex, I actually had something else to talk about.
[01:53:36.675 --> 01:53:37.315]  Is that okay?
[01:53:37.475 --> 01:53:37.996]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:53:38.336 --> 01:53:48.182]  Okay, I just wanted to alert you and your listeners to the fact that they're now sending propaganda out to our children for the Arnold Amendment.
[01:53:49.253 --> 01:53:55.280]  Um, they're doing that through a popular magazine that the teachers use both in public and private schools.
[01:53:55.301 --> 01:53:56.982]  Is that Time magazine for kids?
[01:53:57.243 --> 01:53:58.244]  No, it's Weekly Reader.
[01:53:58.264 --> 01:54:01.167]  Oh, and what's in the Weekly Reader?
[01:54:01.308 --> 01:54:08.296]  Well, there's a big picture of Arnold and it talks about changing the amendment and it does give, you know, it does give the pros and the cons.
[01:54:08.886 --> 01:54:09.947]  I'll tell you what, let me do this.
[01:54:09.967 --> 01:54:13.171]  Let me put you on hold for the next hour, and I want to talk about this.
[01:54:13.191 --> 01:54:16.014]  Folks, it's just pell-mell, constant promotion.
[01:54:16.034 --> 01:54:21.440]  It's like the chips are being promoted, and you don't hear them promoting Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton.
[01:54:21.481 --> 01:54:23.022]  No, it's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold.
[01:54:23.042 --> 01:54:23.403]  That's why
[01:54:24.270 --> 01:54:28.614]  As soon as I'm done with this new film, we're going to get right back into the Arnold stuff and run the ads and do all of that.
[01:54:29.435 --> 01:54:32.938]  But, uh, Catherine Albrecht, any comments about Lord Schwarzenegger for President?
[01:54:33.058 --> 01:54:35.581]  You know, I'm so glad to be out of California.
[01:54:35.701 --> 01:54:38.524]  I cannot tell you enough how glad I am to have left that state.
[01:54:39.224 --> 01:54:40.325]  It won't matter soon.
[01:54:40.345 --> 01:54:44.549]  We'll have our foreign leader who says he admires Hitler over us in the whole country.
[01:54:44.830 --> 01:54:45.030]  Oh boy.
[01:54:47.015 --> 01:54:48.035]  Well, I will say one thing.
[01:54:48.075 --> 01:54:58.798]  I know that some of the members of Schwarzenegger's cabinet, back before there was this big government push for RFID, were already pushing him to promote it.
[01:54:58.858 --> 01:55:07.760]  So I do know that at least members of his cabinet have come out openly and said... Of course, anything horrible, of course, he's on the cutting edge of anything un-American.
[01:55:08.540 --> 01:55:11.341]  Let's go ahead and talk to Roy in California.
[01:55:11.381 --> 01:55:12.081]  Roy, go ahead.
[01:55:16.327 --> 01:55:19.129]  Roy is not listening or is doing something else.
[01:55:19.149 --> 01:55:19.929]  We'll go to him in a minute.
[01:55:20.290 --> 01:55:21.290]  Tim in Ohio.
[01:55:21.330 --> 01:55:22.071]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:55:25.673 --> 01:55:26.594]  These callers, man.
[01:55:27.354 --> 01:55:28.055]  Tim, are you there?
[01:55:29.656 --> 01:55:32.818]  We'll just hold off on callers and let Catherine have the final say.
[01:55:32.838 --> 01:55:36.340]  In fact, I'm going to come back in the next hour and go to your calls and get to all the news.
[01:55:36.900 --> 01:55:40.162]  I want to jump in here, Alex, real quick with something.
[01:55:40.182 --> 01:55:42.244]  You're talking about the total control grid.
[01:55:42.264 --> 01:55:44.285]  Let me paint a picture for you and your listeners.
[01:55:44.990 --> 01:55:49.833]  Of what I think is really the most chilling aspect of RFID and how it fits in.
[01:55:50.473 --> 01:55:56.636]  On the one hand, there's obviously a push to put RFID into identity documents, put it into driver's licenses and passports.
[01:55:57.417 --> 01:56:00.479]  Ultimately, there may well be a push to put it into human beings.
[01:56:00.979 --> 01:56:04.621]  But let me talk about the risk of putting it into our products.
[01:56:05.661 --> 01:56:14.146]  I think that you're going to see, I think in today's news there was a big announcement that a judge had ruled that the IRS could not take your property without a court order.
[01:56:14.548 --> 01:56:15.548]  I don't know if you've heard about that one.
[01:56:15.568 --> 01:56:16.909]  A bunch of people sent me that link.
[01:56:17.249 --> 01:56:21.290]  So it looks like that we're beginning to score some victories against the IRS.
[01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:22.611]  Well, let me make a prediction here.
[01:56:23.051 --> 01:56:25.192]  We're going to see more and more of those sorts of victories.
[01:56:25.232 --> 01:56:30.934]  And then they're going to bring us a national sales tax that brings total terminal control into every local business.
[01:56:30.974 --> 01:56:31.434]  Go ahead.
[01:56:31.694 --> 01:56:32.535]  Yes, exactly.
[01:56:32.615 --> 01:56:37.636]  Because the push is going to be towards a national sales tax and ultimately a global sales tax.
[01:56:37.696 --> 01:56:39.097]  Because that's the only way
[01:56:39.677 --> 01:56:43.618]  That you can essentially control everything that happens all the time.
[01:56:43.898 --> 01:56:45.258]  Now think about this for just a moment.
[01:56:46.038 --> 01:56:51.119]  There are countries that have VAT, or Value Added Tax, and that have different forms of sales tax.
[01:56:51.479 --> 01:57:00.501]  And in one Scandinavian country, and I'll dig up my source and see if we can post it on our website, their police authorities are actually authorized to stop people in shopping districts.
[01:57:00.821 --> 01:57:01.141]  It's Finland!
[01:57:01.161 --> 01:57:01.521]  Finland!
[01:57:01.681 --> 01:57:02.101]  Thank you!
[01:57:02.541 --> 01:57:04.961]  And you have to have an online bank account.
[01:57:05.061 --> 01:57:08.182]  All your money is accessible by the government at any one time.
[01:57:08.917 --> 01:57:17.459]  Well, not only that, but I do believe it's also Finland where the police can stop you as you're walking down the street and demand to see a receipt for the items in your shopping bag.
[01:57:17.799 --> 01:57:21.280]  And if you can't produce the receipt, they can confiscate them and issue you a fine.
[01:57:21.380 --> 01:57:28.102]  Catherine, I know you've got to go, but can you come back and spend about 10, 15 more minutes with us and talk about what it'll be like under the grid?
[01:57:28.122 --> 01:57:28.662]  Absolutely.
[01:57:28.722 --> 01:57:30.702]  I think the sales tax issue is so important.
[01:57:30.762 --> 01:57:31.022]  I know.
[01:57:31.043 --> 01:57:32.823]  I mean, I've been on this for six years.
[01:57:33.564 --> 01:57:41.268]  I figured this out six years ago and then I saw the documents that confirmed my analysis of it later, but stay there, we'll be right back.
[01:57:41.608 --> 01:57:42.048]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.554 --> 01:57:52.594]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.334 --> 01:57:54.415]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.075 --> 01:57:55.895]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.655 --> 01:57:57.555]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.575 --> 01:58:01.956]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.397 --> 01:58:06.538]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.658 --> 01:58:11.459]  Alright, we're going to keep Catherine Albrecht for about 10-15 more minutes.
[01:58:13.405 --> 01:58:22.133]  Then I promise I'm going to get to Kim in Texas, who all the kids are being sent home with their little school readers about Arnold for president and amending the Constitution.
[01:58:22.173 --> 01:58:26.257]  I mean, that's how bad the propaganda, how all-pervasive it's gotten.
[01:58:27.538 --> 01:58:34.464]  And we'll, of course, take some more calls here for Catherine with Roy, if he's there, and Charlie and Charles and Rick and others.
[01:58:35.259 --> 01:58:36.680]  Here's what people need to realize.
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:39.401]  There's such an amount of hatred that's built up against the IRS.
[01:58:54.372 --> 01:58:55.573]  And for understandable reasons.
[01:58:55.633 --> 01:58:58.075]  I mean, it's now mountains of documentation.
[01:58:58.135 --> 01:59:02.218]  Even the IRS agents themselves can't give coherent advice about what to do.
[01:59:02.679 --> 01:59:09.164]  It's really out of control, and I think people have suffered under it and groaned and strained under it so long as they're looking for answers.
[01:59:09.224 --> 01:59:14.848]  Yeah, Forbes has gone to 50 different CPAs with the same tax return, and they get 50 different answers.
[01:59:14.909 --> 01:59:15.529]  Exactly.
[01:59:15.649 --> 01:59:22.735]  So I think that people are rightly frustrated with it, but I would caution people who are frustrated with the IRS system to be very careful
[01:59:23.215 --> 01:59:23.515]  Thank you.
[01:59:34.605 --> 01:59:42.094]  If we move to national sales tax, what I was getting into before the break was about countries where the police can actually stop you and demand to see a receipt.
[01:59:42.114 --> 01:59:48.621]  And the reason they do that is because the sales tax in countries that depend on sales tax as their primary form of income is very high.
[01:59:48.741 --> 01:59:49.783]  It's a huge percentage.
[01:59:49.823 --> 01:59:54.308]  They're talking, in this country, of somewhere between 30 and 40 percent sales tax.
[01:59:54.768 --> 02:00:00.570]  Now, when they do that, some people, it provides an incentive for some people to exchange goods without paying the sales tax.
[02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:07.133]  That way the merchant saves some money, the buyer saves some money, and what that does is create a huge interest in the party.
[02:00:10.994 --> 02:00:12.355]  Well, there's another crucial piece to this, Alex.
[02:00:36.278 --> 02:00:42.445]  You'll see when you look into national sales tax, the reason people oppose it is they call it an oppressive or regressive tax against the poor.
[02:00:42.906 --> 02:00:49.293]  Because, for example, if you're Bill Gates, you're spending one tiny, infinitesimal fraction of your income every month on consumer goods.
[02:00:49.713 --> 02:00:52.356]  If you're a welfare mom, you're spending the majority of your income.
[02:00:52.396 --> 02:00:55.380]  So you're paying a higher proportion of your income in taxes.
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:03.985]  Well, the solution to that will become possible thanks to the loyalty cards that have created all of this sophisticated infrastructure in the nation's cash registers.
[02:01:04.425 --> 02:01:09.848]  It is now possible to identify people at the cash register and charge them different prices for things.
[02:01:10.288 --> 02:01:15.351]  It is now also possible to identify people at the cash register and charge them at different tax rates.
[02:01:15.831 --> 02:01:17.672]  And that's what I predicted this system to move to.
[02:01:17.692 --> 02:01:18.873]  That's what I was just saying, yeah.
[02:01:18.953 --> 02:01:19.473]  Exactly.
[02:01:19.573 --> 02:01:20.974]  So that you will scan your ID
[02:01:21.374 --> 02:01:21.714]  I think so.
[02:01:36.556 --> 02:01:46.318]  They've already said they're going to have to track how much food you're buying, quote, and then that'll be evidence to send an investigation that because you have a lower tax rate, you're off buying for others.
[02:01:46.498 --> 02:01:47.619]  You've got it, exactly.
[02:01:47.679 --> 02:01:54.941]  Now the way you get around that, though, is you say, okay, well now that we have unique ID numbers and everything, we can link those items to the people who bought them.
[02:01:55.361 --> 02:02:00.562]  And if you're Bill Gates walking down the street, somebody could stop you, the tax police could stop you and scan your goods.
[02:02:00.922 --> 02:02:08.466]  And if it turned out they were bought by a third party and not appropriately transferred to you and a record made of that transfer, you could be fined or the goods could be confiscated.
[02:02:08.506 --> 02:02:14.230]  So a whole new level of surveillance and total control, a whole new industry of crime.
[02:02:14.470 --> 02:02:16.071]  You think the IRS is bad?
[02:02:16.311 --> 02:02:25.616]  This will be thousands of times more intrusive and more out of control and more arbitrary sold to us in the name of a fair tax system.
[02:02:25.876 --> 02:02:29.118]  And they're actually going to keep the income tax, they're just going to keep FICA.
[02:02:29.924 --> 02:02:38.334]  And you'll still have to report your income so they charge you the right sales tax rate.
[02:02:39.055 --> 02:02:39.535]  That's right.
[02:02:39.595 --> 02:02:41.838]  We'll be right back with Catherine Albrecht.
[02:02:42.239 --> 02:02:43.120]  Talk more about this.
[02:02:43.180 --> 02:02:43.941]  Take your calls.
[02:02:43.961 --> 02:02:44.701]  You don't want to miss it.
[02:02:44.721 --> 02:02:45.022]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.774 --> 02:02:47.294]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.474 --> 02:02:50.555]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.695 --> 02:02:54.596]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.636 --> 02:02:58.877]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:59.217 --> 02:03:02.998]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:03.058 --> 02:03:04.919]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.239 --> 02:03:08.420]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:03:08.460 --> 02:03:13.182]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.342 --> 02:03:16.384]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.564 --> 02:03:19.425]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.905 --> 02:03:26.028]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.568 --> 02:03:30.352]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:04:56.169 --> 02:04:58.071]  It's on everybody's mind right now.
[02:04:58.111 --> 02:05:01.073]  And if you're self-employed, it's on your mind, too.
[02:05:01.233 --> 02:05:06.238]  Well, I found a company you can call right now and get the affordable health insurance coverage you're looking for.
[02:05:06.358 --> 02:05:09.421]  The Midwest National Life Insurance Company of Tennessee.
[02:05:09.681 --> 02:05:10.622]  Write this number down.
[02:05:10.902 --> 02:05:11.162]  the show.
[02:05:40.922 --> 02:05:47.944]  Alright, we're about to let Catherine Alpert go here in just a few minutes, and then we're going to go to Kim.
[02:06:09.563 --> 02:06:14.425]  And Roy and Charlie and Tim and many others that are patiently holding.
[02:06:15.005 --> 02:06:19.947]  But Catherine, I want to calmly, as I was jumping in there, go over this slowly for people.
[02:06:21.528 --> 02:06:26.029]  What the cashless society control group will look like, what they're setting up, what is admitted.
[02:06:27.070 --> 02:06:30.271]  I just want to finish my comments on this and then get your comments on it.
[02:06:31.451 --> 02:06:35.773]  They have this revolution against the IRS, which is totally constitutional and I support.
[02:06:37.407 --> 02:06:43.853]  Then they come out with a National Sales Tax, while keeping the income tax at about 10%, which they say they're going to do.
[02:06:44.273 --> 02:06:46.195]  Bush is now openly starting to talk about this.
[02:06:46.755 --> 02:06:48.597]  Keep it about 10% for Social Security.
[02:06:49.058 --> 02:06:54.342]  But they've shifted over to a National Sales Tax that they say will be through your driver's license.
[02:06:54.362 --> 02:06:57.385]  You'll scan it, or your personal ID.
[02:06:57.425 --> 02:07:00.568]  You'll scan it, now federally standardized, at the grocery store.
[02:07:01.429 --> 02:07:19.325]  And if you are on welfare or below a certain level, no sales tax, and then above that, 5, 10, 15, 20, some people will pay 45% sales tax, we're openly talking about this, on top of the 10% income tax, supposedly for Social Security, so we're looking at 55 plus percent here.
[02:07:20.971 --> 02:07:32.677]  And then you'll still have to file a income return each year that will still be audited by the same old bureaucracy to quote, make sure you're not cheating about what tax bracket for the sales tax you're going to be in.
[02:07:32.877 --> 02:07:43.242]  That then brings federal control into every terminal in every business in the country with state sales taxes integrated through it, which also brings federal control into the state.
[02:07:44.620 --> 02:07:58.746]  And then just like Finland, where they've had this now for a decade, they stop you at roadside checkpoints, check the goods in your bag, make sure you have a receipt that you bought it yourself, that it wasn't somebody else buying it at another sales tax rate.
[02:07:59.726 --> 02:08:04.688]  They can stop you with the RFID on the street, scan what's on your person, and then they'll have an index.
[02:08:04.748 --> 02:08:08.390]  If you have too much stuff on you that somebody else bought, you'll be fined on the spot.
[02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:09.850]  This is the plan.
[02:08:09.890 --> 02:08:11.791]  This is total control.
[02:08:12.532 --> 02:08:15.634]  And they also track and trace everything you buy, what you do, your habits.
[02:08:16.454 --> 02:08:28.280]  Or they can jack up your insurance costs because it shows you're buying too much Blue Bell Dutch chocolate ice cream, too many T-bone steaks, not enough radishes and lettuce.
[02:08:28.680 --> 02:08:41.047]  I mean, this is what Tommy Thompson and the traffic people have been talking about with the cars tracking you and national toll roads and everything tracking, everything instantly debiting out of these accounts.
[02:08:42.125 --> 02:08:46.689]  It's just a whole new age of taxation and control being sold as a solution.
[02:08:46.989 --> 02:08:47.990]  Catherine, take it from there.
[02:08:48.310 --> 02:08:56.777]  Well, and what you're going to begin to see is more and more egregious abuse by the IRS so that people can feel as though they're having a victory for a change.
[02:08:56.857 --> 02:09:04.923]  And so I would caution people when they want to raise up a cheer against the IRS, remember what you may be cheering could be far, far worse than that.
[02:09:05.483 --> 02:09:10.607]  The other piece, Alex, that I didn't hear you mention that I've given a lot of thought to just because of my research with RFID
[02:09:11.608 --> 02:09:25.539]  Once everything has an RFID tag, that serves as a serial number and when you purchase items today using your loyalty card or your ATM card or your Visa card, you are essentially creating a database entry of what you bought.
[02:09:25.879 --> 02:09:30.622]  What will be different with RFID is you'll create a database entry of what you bought and what its unique number was.
[02:09:31.718 --> 02:09:42.521]  Any physical item on the planet, you'll be able to pick it up and scan it, or the authorities will be able to pick it up and scan it, and be able to trace that back to the point of sale and determine who bought it and at what tax rate.
[02:09:42.921 --> 02:09:46.363]  So essentially it creates, you know, people worry about gun registration.
[02:09:46.663 --> 02:09:52.524]  This creates a system of everything registration, so every physical item on the planet would be registered to someone.
[02:09:52.864 --> 02:09:54.325]  Now imagine you have a yard sale.
[02:09:54.765 --> 02:09:57.673]  And at your yard sale you're selling, oh I don't know, a jacket.
[02:09:58.094 --> 02:10:01.983]  And someone buys that jacket and you don't pay the sales tax on it.
[02:10:02.572 --> 02:10:12.919]  Then you have both committed a federal tax crime and that tax crime can be identified if they scan that individual and scan their jacket and find out that it's still registered to you not to them.
[02:10:13.340 --> 02:10:27.710]  So ultimately what this could mean in the nightmare scenario is that anytime you give a gift, anytime you transfer ownership of an item from one person to another, you will have to register that transfer through some means with the federal government and ultimately
[02:10:28.230 --> 02:10:36.214]  I think it won't be too long before that becomes a global tax so that we can all be sort of paying for the globalized economy.
[02:10:36.234 --> 02:10:40.456]  Did you see Governor Ridge in the BBC and the Telegraph and the Times two or three weeks ago?
[02:10:40.496 --> 02:10:50.681]  He was in England and they were already doing the treaties to standardize and he said we need a global identifying number through biometrics and through chips, through RFID.
[02:10:51.679 --> 02:10:52.480]  He said through chips.
[02:10:53.241 --> 02:10:54.302]  And here they are.
[02:10:54.322 --> 02:11:00.809]  The UN three years ago had a big world population summit in Australia called for a world ID number.
[02:11:01.009 --> 02:11:04.152]  And again, it's like they've already federalized the IDs here.
[02:11:04.192 --> 02:11:05.374]  The average American has no idea.
[02:11:05.414 --> 02:11:06.555]  It just has your state on it.
[02:11:06.915 --> 02:11:12.918]  It'll be the same thing as part of this global tax, through the Tobin Tax, with the money transfers through all your purchases.
[02:11:13.299 --> 02:11:14.720]  This is their plan.
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:22.204]  This is happening in every gun you buy, all the bullets you buy, what you do, it's all... I mean, just think about it, folks.
[02:11:22.244 --> 02:11:27.547]  Well, they can even sprinkle tiny RFID chips the size of a speck of dust into gunpowder.
[02:11:27.567 --> 02:11:33.070]  So even if you think you're going to make a mess and get out of the system, they can sprinkle it into really anything.
[02:11:34.111 --> 02:11:35.392]  It's a very real concern.
[02:11:35.892 --> 02:11:47.502]  I know some people, particularly Christians, who are concerned about the time of the Mark of the Beast, which of course would lend itself very easily to this, because at that point you don't have to worry about people trading driver's licenses and cheating on their taxes.
[02:11:47.542 --> 02:11:51.666]  You just have them do it right through the chip implant or whatever mark it is in their hand.
[02:11:52.066 --> 02:11:55.228]  And when I've spoken to Christians, many of them will say, well, I'll just live off the grid.
[02:11:55.608 --> 02:12:02.812]  I'll just go live, you know, somewhere out in the country, or I'll get myself a little piece of land, and I'll have my brother-in-law, and he's willing to stay in the system.
[02:12:02.852 --> 02:12:04.012]  He'll come out and he'll supply me.
[02:12:04.052 --> 02:12:05.833]  That'll be a massive crime.
[02:12:06.173 --> 02:12:10.095]  And they'll be able to track how much the brother-in-law buys.
[02:12:10.476 --> 02:12:12.857]  They do this in countries with sales tax, again, Finland's the worst.
[02:12:13.317 --> 02:12:16.959]  They track, well, you know, you're buying too much food, you're buying too much
[02:12:18.126 --> 02:12:34.776]  Do you know Alex, I was thinking about this in reference to Anne Frank who of course hid out in the attic of a family and her entire family was fed through whatever they could get through their ration cards and they shared their leftovers with the family of Anne Frank.
[02:12:35.156 --> 02:12:42.280]  Well, I recently read a document from AC Nielsen that they can actually determine whether you're buying more
[02:12:43.238 --> 02:12:47.421]  More than your family needs by the amount of toilet paper that you purchased.
[02:12:47.441 --> 02:12:51.965]  So if you buy too much toilet paper, they can conclude that you have one extra person in your house.
[02:12:52.005 --> 02:12:53.866]  And it's so funny because who would have thought that?
[02:12:54.246 --> 02:13:01.892]  And then again, this is also integrated into dozens of states are passing laws where if your child's a little bit overweight,
[02:13:02.852 --> 02:13:04.833]  They go ahead and call CPS on you.
[02:13:05.594 --> 02:13:16.959]  So again, it's this total control, forced psychological testing of all the children, which also doubles as an interrogation, or like, you know, doing your confession.
[02:13:16.979 --> 02:13:20.541]  I mean, this is, these folks, they are setting up the likes
[02:13:21.681 --> 02:13:26.045]  A police state Stasi system, the likes of which the globe has never seen.
[02:13:26.165 --> 02:13:39.274]  Well, and Alex, do you know that the biggest grocery chain here in New England, a chain called Stop and Shop, is kind of the Enron bad boys of the supermarket industry because all their senior executives have been indicted, but they spent three million dollars on a program to convert
[02:13:39.694 --> 02:13:40.074]  It's simple.
[02:13:40.094 --> 02:13:41.715]  This little radio broadcast is on and about
[02:14:06.937 --> 02:14:11.338]  I don't know, 50 plus cities and towns on the AM and FM dial all over the country.
[02:14:11.358 --> 02:14:12.358]  I'm shortwave on the internet.
[02:14:12.838 --> 02:14:24.241]  But what if listeners in every city, I don't care if it's three of you or one of you, put signs together, criticize the loyalty cards, criticize the RFID, send a press release out to local newspaper and talk radio.
[02:14:24.521 --> 02:14:26.201]  We're going to be here protesting this.
[02:14:26.221 --> 02:14:26.861]  Here's why.
[02:14:27.222 --> 02:14:30.422]  You could do radio interviews from your cell phone while you're protesting.
[02:14:30.442 --> 02:14:32.363]  The local station will want you on.
[02:14:34.043 --> 02:14:36.687]  Everywhere, you know, hyping this up, standing up.
[02:14:36.727 --> 02:14:39.691]  This is what we're going to have to do to stop this system.
[02:14:39.911 --> 02:14:46.680]  This is what we need, and in fact, one of the things that I really want to do is get out to Texas and protest Walmart.
[02:14:47.442 --> 02:14:55.928]  It's distribution centers that are pushing this RFID and they're actually moving to this item level tagging and experimenting with it at those Walmart stores in Texas.
[02:14:56.648 --> 02:15:00.631]  It's amazing how just a few people showing up with a protest sign.
[02:15:00.651 --> 02:15:05.915]  If you can even get two or three neighbors together, call up the local news, take some pictures yourself, stick them on the website.
[02:15:06.215 --> 02:15:08.336]  You know, there have been protests with two people at them.
[02:15:08.376 --> 02:15:10.137]  In one case it was a man and his baby.
[02:15:10.458 --> 02:15:15.301]  That protest is now famous around the world and in fact it got an entire file stopped.
[02:15:15.541 --> 02:15:27.665]  We had a protest against a police checkpoint and doubled it because it was by an HEB against their thumb scanners and that got in the news and HEB's putting them in all over Texas but not Austin because we protested.
[02:15:28.025 --> 02:15:34.787]  Well and it's amazing the power that we have and I think part of this is to, I think part of the purpose of the mainstream media is to convince us that we
[02:15:34.787 --> 02:15:37.069]  We don't have any power that these things are a done deal.
[02:15:37.489 --> 02:15:47.158]  In all of the documentation on RFID, they reiterate, and there's confidential documents that we obtained, that they want to emphasize that it's inevitable, and they want people to be apathetic.
[02:15:47.198 --> 02:15:50.120]  They actually say they want to rely on consumer advocacy.
[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:51.141]  Yeah, what was it?
[02:15:51.161 --> 02:15:52.082]  76% are totally against it.
[02:15:52.282 --> 02:15:52.582]  That's right.
[02:15:52.602 --> 02:15:53.843]  But we must make them feel hopeless.
[02:15:54.164 --> 02:15:54.864]  Isn't it amazing?
[02:15:54.924 --> 02:15:56.826]  And it's right there spelled out in their documents.
[02:15:56.886 --> 02:15:59.488]  It's just amazing that, you know, and people buy it.
[02:15:59.528 --> 02:16:00.229]  People really do.
[02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:02.991]  Catherine, I really want to thank you for coming on with us.
[02:16:03.691 --> 02:16:05.893]  God bless you, and I look forward to talking to you in the near future.
[02:16:05.913 --> 02:16:06.834]  Well, always a pleasure.

[02:16:16.181 --> 02:16:17.062]  Catherine, thank you.
[02:16:17.222 --> 02:16:18.423]  Okay, folks, I wanted to...
[02:16:19.628 --> 02:16:24.492]  Before we went to break, get Kim in Texas so I can maybe hold her over, because I was talking to her during the break.
[02:16:25.633 --> 02:16:36.483]  Kim, you were saying that not only is the Worship Arnold and Men in the Constitution all over the news, but it's in these magazines that they use as curriculum all over the country.
[02:16:36.543 --> 02:16:37.143]  Tell us about it.
[02:16:37.904 --> 02:16:45.070]  Actually, I'm looking at the Weekly Reader website and it actually says here that 90% of the school districts in the United States use their materials.
[02:16:45.615 --> 02:16:52.158]  Okay, so tell us about the reader, and tell us about the Arnold situation, but then get into the rest of the propaganda that's in these.
[02:16:52.839 --> 02:17:02.603]  Okay, the Arnold article that I looked at just basically has a big picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and it says, should we amend the Constitution?
[02:17:02.643 --> 02:17:05.665]  And it gives the pros and cons of why we should or why we shouldn't.
[02:17:06.671 --> 02:17:09.172]  Um, and I don't, I apologize, I don't have it in front of me.
[02:17:09.192 --> 02:17:13.892]  I had to send it back to school, but I will, I will send that to you so that you can take a look at it.
[02:17:13.932 --> 02:17:15.373]  What were the different pros and cons?
[02:17:16.033 --> 02:17:19.153]  Um, the, uh, you want me to hold on?
[02:17:19.173 --> 02:17:22.374]  Yeah, no, hold over and then we'll hear about it on the other side.
[02:17:22.754 --> 02:17:25.855]  And then you were describing for me the different stuff that's in the thing every week.
[02:17:25.875 --> 02:17:28.035]  I can give you various examples, yes.
[02:17:28.055 --> 02:17:33.796]  Yeah, I want to hear about this when we get back, and then we'll go to Roy and Charlie and
[02:17:34.685 --> 02:17:42.470]  Rick and Tim and everybody else, and there's so much other news about the Iraq election, about the CIA protecting Nazis, about Big Brother.

[02:18:46.716 --> 02:18:48.937]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[02:18:49.358 --> 02:18:53.720]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[02:18:53.980 --> 02:18:59.784]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[02:19:00.024 --> 02:19:04.087]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[02:19:04.367 --> 02:19:10.010]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[02:19:10.130 --> 02:19:12.752]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[02:19:14.833 --> 02:19:18.735]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 an ounce.
[02:19:18.775 --> 02:19:21.176]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[02:19:21.496 --> 02:19:23.797]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[02:19:24.178 --> 02:19:27.799]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[02:19:28.280 --> 02:19:34.483]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[02:19:34.923 --> 02:19:35.903]  You'll be glad you did.
[02:19:35.923 --> 02:19:36.684]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:36.724 --> 02:19:36.964]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:45.744 --> 02:19:48.226]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.926 --> 02:19:55.571]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[02:19:56.752 --> 02:19:59.033]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[02:19:59.854 --> 02:20:06.078]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[02:20:06.978 --> 02:20:15.064]  These laws are already being used in Canada, Britain, Australia, and Sweden against Christians for reading certain Bible passages.
[02:20:16.087 --> 02:20:23.951]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:20:27.253 --> 02:20:31.235]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[02:20:44.913 --> 02:20:48.376]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.

[02:21:59.692 --> 02:22:06.180]  Alright, let's have that same conversation we had off air 45 minutes ago when you were holding, Kim.
[02:22:06.943 --> 02:22:11.445]  And, uh, we, uh, went to you right before a break, and then you were unable to finish your comments, and then we brought you back up.
[02:22:11.965 --> 02:22:21.489]  Uh, because I know they got Time Life for kids, Newsweek for kids that are used in most schools, and, I mean, like, every other issue is report guns at home, take vaccinations.
[02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:22.769]  R.F.I.D.
[02:22:22.930 --> 02:22:24.410]  chips under your skin are great.
[02:22:24.610 --> 02:22:25.871]  Oh, kids, it's so wonderful.
[02:22:25.891 --> 02:22:27.432]  I mean, I've gotten copies of this.
[02:22:27.672 --> 02:22:28.453]  It's Orwellian.
[02:22:29.013 --> 02:22:31.574]  But this is some other publication I'm not familiar with.
[02:22:31.834 --> 02:22:34.616]  Tell us the name of it again and tell us the type of stuff that's in there.
[02:22:34.636 --> 02:22:38.398]  It's called the Weekly Reader and actually it's been around for over 100 years.
[02:22:40.739 --> 02:22:44.221]  I'm looking here at the webpage and it says since May 20, 1902.
[02:22:45.990 --> 02:22:49.651]  And it does say that 90% of the school district use their materials.
[02:22:49.751 --> 02:22:53.973]  Okay, so they got this thing about Arnold in their amendment to the Constitution.
[02:22:54.093 --> 02:23:11.179]  One of the pros for why we should have the amendment, actually, and the people that are for putting the amendment there, is because it's un-American, you know, and it goes against equality for all, because people come here
[02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:14.862]  You know, for the American dream, which should include the presidency.
[02:23:15.042 --> 02:23:15.623]  That's their argument.
[02:23:15.643 --> 02:23:19.545]  Which should improve everything to have an Austrian who says he loves Hitler, yeah.
[02:23:19.705 --> 02:23:20.006]  Right.
[02:23:20.346 --> 02:23:20.946]  Sounds wonderful.
[02:23:21.086 --> 02:23:28.531]  Yeah, and then the only con against it was that, you know, if you're born, you know, you're more loyal to your native-born country.
[02:23:28.551 --> 02:23:32.574]  Well, you know, Arnold likes to talk about defending our homeland by giving our rights up.
[02:23:32.774 --> 02:23:34.115]  This isn't his homeland!
[02:23:34.475 --> 02:23:34.716]  Right.
[02:23:34.836 --> 02:23:36.637]  Your homeland is always where you were born.
[02:23:37.501 --> 02:23:42.526]  Okay, so continuing here... And then also, one of the big things... Let me just stop right there.
[02:23:42.546 --> 02:23:42.806]  Okay.
[02:23:42.846 --> 02:23:52.676]  People are against somebody coming to be their governor if, you know, they just moved their tenures before and they're really from New Jersey, and then now, you know, they're coming to California.
[02:23:53.016 --> 02:23:57.180]  Well, imagine, folks, I mean, why are we putting up with this carpetbagger Arnold?
[02:23:58.556 --> 02:24:00.697]  Continuing, you told me some of the other stuff that was in there.
[02:24:00.877 --> 02:24:04.719]  Right, you know, they always do have, you know, get your flu immunizations.
[02:24:04.759 --> 02:24:05.600]  They have things like that.
[02:24:05.660 --> 02:24:18.066]  But the big thing that really bothered me, and I did actually go talk to the teachers about, was right before the elections, they had in the publication, they had a mock election where the children had to choose.
[02:24:18.566 --> 02:24:22.248]  And they had to choose between Bush or Kerry.
[02:24:22.288 --> 02:24:23.529]  They could not put other.
[02:24:24.569 --> 02:24:27.471]  Which was a big problem for my children because, you know,
[02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:29.680]  They know how I feel.
[02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:33.422]  90% of the schools having this garbage.
[02:24:33.462 --> 02:24:35.323]  Now, you made a good point though.
[02:24:35.363 --> 02:24:41.385]  You said that every week you go over this with your daughter and actually use it as a way to educate her about propaganda.
[02:24:41.585 --> 02:24:44.446]  And that's what I want to tell parents that they need to do.
[02:24:44.546 --> 02:24:47.967]  And you do need to let the teachers know that you don't approve of this publication.
[02:24:47.987 --> 02:24:48.768]  I mean, I have.
[02:24:49.528 --> 02:24:54.330]  I don't expect them to rip it out of the classroom just because I disapprove.
[02:24:55.131 --> 02:24:58.254]  I do let them know I don't approve of it, and I do go through.
[02:24:58.274 --> 02:25:00.235]  My second grader gets it as well.
[02:25:00.976 --> 02:25:10.244]  Well listen, 15 years ago, when I was about to graduate from high school, I'm pretty young folks, but 15 years ago, still a long time ago, they had Channel 1.
[02:25:11.024 --> 02:25:15.328]  And every day for 15 minutes and second period, they would beam this thing into every classroom.
[02:25:15.368 --> 02:25:16.129]  We had to watch it.
[02:25:16.749 --> 02:25:17.670]  Couldn't go to the bathroom.
[02:25:18.377 --> 02:25:27.102]  And it was nothing but Nike commercials in between Skittles and Coca-Cola commercials, but the ads were, guns are evil, turn your guns in, world government's good.
[02:25:27.702 --> 02:25:33.225]  I mean, because they knew they had a defenseless, psychologically defenseless audience compared to adults.
[02:25:33.725 --> 02:25:35.046]  And it was something like out of 1984.
[02:25:35.386 --> 02:25:35.586]  Right.
[02:25:35.846 --> 02:25:45.972]  And that's still what they're doing to the children today, and we have to get involved and talk to our children.
[02:25:46.474 --> 02:25:55.504]  And, you know, my daughter gets a big kick out of it and she actually enjoys going back to school and having the information and being able to say, well, I don't approve of this or I don't like this.
[02:25:55.604 --> 02:26:00.650]  And so it makes her feel better to know that she's better informed and doesn't just have to take what they give to her.
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:06.863]  Well, all over the country, one student will say, we shouldn't have to wear these IDs around our necks with barcodes.
[02:26:07.384 --> 02:26:08.524]  And then 10 students do it.
[02:26:08.584 --> 02:26:09.505]  And then they kick them out.
[02:26:09.605 --> 02:26:10.706]  Then 50 do it.
[02:26:10.726 --> 02:26:12.847]  And then whole schools have to throw the system out.
[02:26:12.867 --> 02:26:15.488]  I mean, that's happened in Missouri, Louisiana.
[02:26:16.589 --> 02:26:17.650]  It's happening more and more.
[02:26:17.770 --> 02:26:19.811]  And if you're going to leave your child in one of these camps,
[02:26:20.391 --> 02:26:30.175]  And they've designed it to where people basically have to, because the economy's falling apart in many cases, then might as well be deprogramming them nightly, and then having them go to school and deprogram others.
[02:26:30.215 --> 02:26:37.499]  You can actually turn the propaganda around against them, and suddenly it's a game with the students to decipher how they're being manipulated.
[02:26:37.959 --> 02:26:39.660]  And that's exactly what we're doing.
[02:26:39.680 --> 02:26:40.600]  Of course, I was lucky.
[02:26:40.700 --> 02:26:42.661]  I had public school teachers, a couple of them.
[02:26:42.981 --> 02:26:44.021]  I had this one coach.
[02:26:46.295 --> 02:26:50.358]  Who would sit there with a history book and go, you know this is propaganda, right?
[02:26:50.878 --> 02:26:52.299]  And he was kind of a patriot.
[02:26:52.939 --> 02:26:57.362]  And I wouldn't say as hardcore as we are today, but we didn't know as much 15 years ago.
[02:26:58.403 --> 02:26:59.263]  What was his name?
[02:26:59.403 --> 02:26:59.784]  Coach?
[02:27:00.624 --> 02:27:01.745]  Now it's driving me crazy.
[02:27:01.765 --> 02:27:02.525]  I can't remember his name.
[02:27:02.825 --> 02:27:03.966]  He was real nice though.
[02:27:04.566 --> 02:27:08.329]  On the last day of school he gave me a card and he said, you really impressed me with your knowledge of history.
[02:27:08.929 --> 02:27:11.531]  And in the card it just said, I got a feeling you're going to be famous.
[02:27:11.571 --> 02:27:17.255]  I don't know why he said that, but he said, I think God's got great things in store for you.
[02:27:17.715 --> 02:27:19.476]  I didn't know what he meant by that, but he was really nice.
[02:27:19.516 --> 02:27:20.837]  And now I can't remember his name!
[02:27:21.798 --> 02:27:22.638]  What was his name?
[02:27:22.838 --> 02:27:24.580]  Hey, Jim, good to hear from you.
[02:27:25.160 --> 02:27:26.181]  God bless you, okay?
[02:27:27.001 --> 02:27:27.802]  Good to hear from you.
[02:27:28.622 --> 02:27:29.323]  Absolutely.
[02:27:29.443 --> 02:27:30.003]  Alright.
[02:27:30.804 --> 02:27:33.485]  We'll be back with more of your calls and a bunch of news.
[02:27:33.505 --> 02:27:34.086]  Keep it locked in.
[02:27:36.235 --> 02:27:37.116]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.636 --> 02:27:39.237]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.138 --> 02:27:42.820]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.170 --> 02:27:54.474]  The media is flooded with reports of everything from antibiotic resistant super germs to the possibility of a flu epidemic due to a vaccine shortage.
[02:27:54.854 --> 02:27:59.516]  If we can't rely on traditional medicines, what are you going to do to keep you and your family healthy and safe?
[02:27:59.756 --> 02:28:03.618]  There is now a scientifically proven alternative called Super Silver Solution.
[02:28:03.859 --> 02:28:06.780]  Super Silver is a combination of supercharged silver and oxygen.
[02:28:07.100 --> 02:28:13.945]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[02:28:14.225 --> 02:28:22.791]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[02:28:23.111 --> 02:28:29.456]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[02:30:32.529 --> 02:30:32.609]  1-800-419-W.
[02:30:53.616 --> 02:30:59.620]  I'm going to give each caller about a minute and a half here so I get time to cover some more of this news.
[02:30:59.640 --> 02:31:08.025]  So we'll go to Roy and Rick and Tim and Elizabeth and Mike and that's going to be it for calls because I've just really got a bunch of stuff I haven't detailed yet.
[02:31:08.045 --> 02:31:12.008]  I did mention a lot of it in the first hour but haven't really gotten to it in any detail yet.
[02:31:12.668 --> 02:31:13.949]  Before I do that though,
[02:31:15.515 --> 02:31:18.876]  Grab a pen and paper, or commit this to memory.
[02:31:19.416 --> 02:31:21.097]  Please take action.
[02:31:22.017 --> 02:31:27.419]  We're not going to stop this control grid unless you get involved in little ways every day.
[02:31:27.959 --> 02:31:30.360]  Millions of us doing it is unstoppable.
[02:31:30.680 --> 02:31:34.041]  We do have power, we can affect change, and we've got to.
[02:31:35.062 --> 02:31:38.983]  We do not want the globalists to get their sinister program into place.
[02:31:40.533 --> 02:31:42.454]  I have made eleven films.
[02:31:42.514 --> 02:31:46.195]  You can get all of them at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:46.655 --> 02:31:52.216]  You can order hard copies of them there via the secure online shopping cart, the VHS DVD.
[02:31:52.616 --> 02:32:05.600]  I carry a bunch of other books and great videos and pro-Second Amendment t-shirts and Infowars.com bumper stickers and all that liberal stuff you need, you know, like pro-Second Amendment stuff.
[02:32:06.780 --> 02:32:07.600]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:09.721]  The point is you need to have it.
[02:32:10.749 --> 02:32:13.330]  So go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:32:13.650 --> 02:32:17.252]  Peruse the safe, secure, online shopping cart.
[02:32:17.332 --> 02:32:19.633]  Watch free video clips of the films.
[02:32:20.493 --> 02:32:22.634]  In some cases, I got like, you know, it's a two-hour video.
[02:32:22.654 --> 02:32:24.074]  I got 40 minutes up there for free.
[02:32:24.395 --> 02:32:25.595]  So you get an idea of what you're getting.
[02:32:26.375 --> 02:32:27.136]  Get the videos.
[02:32:27.176 --> 02:32:28.116]  Make copies of them.
[02:32:28.136 --> 02:32:29.236]  Put them on AXS TV.
[02:32:29.256 --> 02:32:31.497]  Get them out to opinion makers in your area.
[02:32:31.597 --> 02:32:35.059]  I want to commend those of you that have gotten the films and that have done this.
[02:32:35.139 --> 02:32:35.719]  Great job!
[02:32:35.819 --> 02:32:36.699]  Please keep it up.
[02:32:36.900 --> 02:32:37.840]  Keep making copies.
[02:32:39.699 --> 02:32:41.080]  Just such a massive effect.
[02:32:41.100 --> 02:32:42.181]  You are having an effect.
[02:32:42.201 --> 02:32:42.841]  God bless you.
[02:32:44.542 --> 02:32:45.803]  I've made so many videos.
[02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:46.643]  They're all excellent.
[02:32:46.683 --> 02:32:49.145]  I mean, take three or four minutes of Rotary.
[02:32:50.966 --> 02:32:55.289]  We show FEMA saying all Christians and all Founding Fathers and all gun owners are terrorists.
[02:32:55.729 --> 02:32:57.430]  In a training session, video of it.
[02:32:57.630 --> 02:33:00.352]  Then we show close-ups of the manuals with even worse stuff.
[02:33:00.452 --> 02:33:01.933]  All homeschoolers are terrorists.
[02:33:02.432 --> 02:33:03.732]  You know, that's a three-year-old film.
[02:33:03.772 --> 02:33:13.655]  Now you've opened the AP up and feds are training school districts that homeschoolers are terrorists doing drills where the homeschoolers come kill everyone, you know, to create fear and psychological damage.
[02:33:14.355 --> 02:33:17.056]  I mean, it's just, you need to have this, people.
[02:33:17.336 --> 02:33:20.977]  You need to go to your church and play video of FEMA saying all Christians are terrorists.
[02:33:22.237 --> 02:33:23.217]  People need to see that.
[02:33:23.277 --> 02:33:24.358]  That's three minutes of the film.
[02:33:25.018 --> 02:33:29.379]  Then we show police from their own squad car video and the microphones on their ties
[02:33:31.252 --> 02:33:40.876]  From the training to implementing it on the street with a woman with no criminal record, because she has a pocket Constitution in one of my videos and a Harrison Ford video.
[02:33:40.896 --> 02:33:42.897]  You know, Patriot games.
[02:33:42.937 --> 02:33:44.818]  The word Patriot freaks them out.
[02:33:45.078 --> 02:33:46.159]  That's when they begin rummaging.
[02:33:46.199 --> 02:33:46.739]  Patriot?
[02:33:46.799 --> 02:33:47.519]  What Patriot?
[02:33:48.159 --> 02:33:49.740]  Is this illegal, they ask.
[02:33:51.721 --> 02:33:52.862]  They get over to the side of the car.
[02:33:52.922 --> 02:33:53.862]  Is this illegal?
[02:33:53.882 --> 02:33:57.364]  Is she allowed to have stuff about the Constitution?
[02:33:57.484 --> 02:34:00.565]  I don't know, because see, they've been in the FEMA training.
[02:34:01.215 --> 02:34:02.677]  You want to enter the Twilight Zone?
[02:34:02.697 --> 02:34:05.441]  That's just a few minutes from one film.
[02:34:06.202 --> 02:34:08.124]  I can't describe all the stuff that's in these.
[02:34:08.445 --> 02:34:11.008]  Troops running checkpoints, searching people's vehicles.
[02:34:11.349 --> 02:34:12.831]  Just out of the blue.
[02:34:13.592 --> 02:34:16.316]  In North Carolina and just all over the place.
[02:34:18.248 --> 02:34:19.669]  You need to get the films.
[02:34:19.729 --> 02:34:20.770]  Total free number to order.
[02:34:20.790 --> 02:34:22.671]  You can call and ask for the different titles when you call.
[02:34:23.151 --> 02:34:24.072]  No obligation to buy.
[02:34:24.112 --> 02:34:27.173]  Just give them a call, listen to what we have to offer, and then take action.
[02:34:27.193 --> 02:34:27.834]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:34:27.854 --> 02:34:27.894]  888-253-3139.
[02:34:27.914 --> 02:34:28.794]  Or just write to me.
[02:34:28.814 --> 02:34:31.436]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[02:34:47.023 --> 02:34:48.004]  We've got a question.
[02:34:48.064 --> 02:34:55.430]  Have you ever, in all the times you've made your documentary films, ever tried to get it to a major distributor for a film company, like Lionsgate or anything like that?
[02:35:16.556 --> 02:35:21.477]  You know, I have before, and uh... Did they not take it?
[02:35:21.677 --> 02:35:26.338]  Well, yeah, they just want to, not that particular company you mentioned, but they just want to edit it or change it.
[02:35:26.598 --> 02:35:27.998]  It's too hardcore for them.
[02:35:28.718 --> 02:35:31.299]  But, but they would, uh, put, uh, Michael Moore's in there.
[02:35:31.319 --> 02:35:35.579]  See, I don't understand how he can get his in there and get his not.
[02:35:35.599 --> 02:35:36.599]  Okay, okay, let me tell you something.
[02:35:37.200 --> 02:35:40.500]  My films are like a glass of lemonade that has five lemons in it.
[02:35:41.220 --> 02:35:45.801]  Okay, and Michael Moore's got about two drops of lemon in his, and then a bunch of it to this info.
[02:35:48.249 --> 02:36:02.957]  Well, I was thinking, if one major film company or even an independent film company that could get out to major theaters could have the guts enough to put yours out there, imagine the impact that would have on the mainstream.
[02:36:04.338 --> 02:36:08.741]  Yeah, well, getting it in theaters, I mean, the films have been shown in hundreds of theaters.
[02:36:11.309 --> 02:36:12.369]  It's totally different.
[02:36:12.670 --> 02:36:16.851]  I mean, if you're talking about getting a DVD on the shelf, something like that could be done.
[02:36:17.592 --> 02:36:24.374]  But still, just the power of you, sir, making copies of the videos is much bigger than it'll ever be getting them on store shelves.
[02:36:25.275 --> 02:36:26.375]  Well, that's what I've been doing.
[02:36:26.875 --> 02:36:27.556]  Well, God bless you.
[02:36:27.596 --> 02:36:28.096]  Anything else?
[02:36:28.116 --> 02:36:28.916]  Nope, that's it.
[02:36:28.936 --> 02:36:29.917]  Just wanted to ask you that.
[02:36:30.017 --> 02:36:31.037]  Keep it up, my friend.
[02:36:31.397 --> 02:36:38.040]  I mean, look, I know for a fact I've signed probably 500 waivers for people that air my videos on AXS TV.
[02:36:38.340 --> 02:36:40.961]  And again, on the end of the takeover, I have a waiver right there.
[02:36:42.286 --> 02:36:45.528]  So, you know, people don't even need to call me to get that, okay?
[02:36:46.449 --> 02:36:48.250]  Just fill the form out and say you got permission.
[02:36:48.290 --> 02:36:48.670]  It's simple.
[02:36:48.710 --> 02:36:49.350]  You heard it here.
[02:36:50.551 --> 02:37:01.377]  But if I've signed over the years 500 of those babies, and the average access TV station, you know, at any one time has got thousands of viewers, we've reached millions that way.
[02:37:01.478 --> 02:37:02.018]  Keep it up.
[02:37:02.078 --> 02:37:02.978]  Keep re-airing them.
[02:37:03.479 --> 02:37:04.860]  All access TV is still around.
[02:37:06.020 --> 02:37:07.101]  Thanks for your effort, Roy.
[02:37:08.654 --> 02:37:09.935]  Yeah, you know, I've taken time out.
[02:37:09.975 --> 02:37:10.995]  I've gone to L.A.
[02:37:11.175 --> 02:37:16.477]  on request to meet with these people and it's just that they're a bunch of cowards.
[02:37:16.898 --> 02:37:18.158]  It's a big, fat waste of time.
[02:37:19.238 --> 02:37:22.540]  I mean, look at how much trouble Mel Gibson had just putting out The Passion of the Christ.
[02:37:23.640 --> 02:37:25.961]  And that guy's got hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:37:26.421 --> 02:37:28.602]  And it was hard for him to get it out.
[02:37:29.682 --> 02:37:36.165]  So, stuff like mine, the only way it would happen is if somebody like Mel Gibson or somebody else like that wanted
[02:37:36.974 --> 02:37:38.595]  Alex, one thing I haven't heard anybody talk about is the
[02:38:07.012 --> 02:38:09.834]  The way they read the power and gas meters.
[02:38:10.735 --> 02:38:14.978]  Yeah, they have wireless pods up now that wirelessly read your home.
[02:38:15.599 --> 02:38:15.899]  Yeah.
[02:38:16.499 --> 02:38:20.002]  I was thinking maybe they could be using that to fire on you.
[02:38:20.703 --> 02:38:21.303]  Oh, they are!
[02:38:21.743 --> 02:38:25.066]  A lot of those have an extra pod on them that is surveillance cameras.
[02:38:25.446 --> 02:38:27.227]  That's been in the industry publications.
[02:38:27.968 --> 02:38:30.310]  And they can also be used to read RFID.
[02:38:30.690 --> 02:38:30.950]  Yeah.
[02:38:33.652 --> 02:38:35.554]  They read the meters out here that way.
[02:38:36.434 --> 02:38:45.461]  And I think, you know, people could be using that kind of system to, you know, do electronic harassment or... Well, they are.
[02:38:45.482 --> 02:38:45.882]  ...crime control.
[02:38:46.462 --> 02:38:46.723]  They are.
[02:38:46.743 --> 02:38:47.383]  Thanks for the call.
[02:38:47.543 --> 02:38:47.823]  Okay.
[02:38:48.224 --> 02:38:48.864]  I appreciate it.
[02:38:49.305 --> 02:38:52.427]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:38:52.467 --> 02:38:53.148]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:38:53.388 --> 02:38:54.048]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:38:54.189 --> 02:38:55.350]  Bravo for Friday night.
[02:38:55.410 --> 02:38:55.710]  Thank you.
[02:38:56.832 --> 02:38:57.712]  Hey, how did that sound?
[02:38:57.932 --> 02:38:59.133]  I didn't have a chance to hear any of it.
[02:38:59.193 --> 02:39:00.153]  I got the whole thing recorded.
[02:39:00.173 --> 02:39:01.013]  Want me to send you a copy?
[02:39:01.353 --> 02:39:02.094]  Yeah, that'd be great!
[02:39:02.194 --> 02:39:02.974]  Very good, I'll do that.
[02:39:03.874 --> 02:39:08.015]  I've got a membership to Streamlink, I just don't have time to go do it yet, but yeah, send it to me.
[02:39:08.035 --> 02:39:08.836]  Oh yeah, you sounded great.
[02:39:10.116 --> 02:39:18.458]  I came across an article on the Veterans for Peace website I wanted to share with all the listeners, where they talk about the 14 characteristics of fascism.
[02:39:18.498 --> 02:39:20.899]  Now, I read through them, I can do the slugs in like 30 seconds.
[02:39:21.179 --> 02:39:22.560]  Well, I played it in the first hour.
[02:39:23.380 --> 02:39:23.520]  What?
[02:39:24.224 --> 02:39:26.325]  I played the 14 Characteristics of Fascism.
[02:39:26.485 --> 02:39:26.965]  Oh, you did?
[02:39:27.425 --> 02:39:28.005]  Yeah.
[02:39:28.065 --> 02:39:28.385]  Interesting.
[02:39:28.566 --> 02:39:29.326]  I missed the first hour.
[02:39:29.506 --> 02:39:29.826]  You know what?
[02:39:29.846 --> 02:39:30.626]  Let's just do this.
[02:39:30.726 --> 02:39:31.747]  Let's just play it again.
[02:39:31.767 --> 02:39:33.527]  Because then I'll want to comment on it.
[02:39:33.547 --> 02:39:33.787]  Oh, great.
[02:39:33.807 --> 02:39:34.608]  What do you want to hold?
[02:39:34.988 --> 02:39:36.408]  Do you have that clip there, John?
[02:39:36.428 --> 02:39:39.149]  Okay, he's finding it in the computer.
[02:39:39.169 --> 02:39:41.490]  And again, this is off the video off my website.
[02:39:41.870 --> 02:39:44.751]  I don't totally agree with this, but it's food for thought.
[02:39:45.611 --> 02:39:50.533]  Okay, I don't totally agree with this, but I would say definitely 12 of these are being followed.
[02:39:51.213 --> 02:39:52.974]  And I've got some comments on it.
[02:39:53.966 --> 02:39:55.427]  Once we have it opened up.
[02:39:56.067 --> 02:39:57.187]  Okay, go ahead and play.
[02:39:57.207 --> 02:39:58.508]  We'll be right back in about two minutes.
[02:39:59.368 --> 02:40:03.330]  There are fourteen defining characteristics
[02:40:14.998 --> 02:40:22.844]  According to a college professor, Dr. Lawrence Britt, who has examined fascist regimes, there are 14 defining characteristics common to each.
[02:40:22.884 --> 02:40:23.645]  So you tell me.
[02:40:24.986 --> 02:40:26.827]  Powerful and continuing nationalism.
[02:40:27.888 --> 02:40:31.031]  Flags are seen everywhere, flag symbols on clothing, public displays.
[02:40:31.531 --> 02:40:33.653]  Disdain for the recognition of human rights.
[02:40:34.562 --> 02:40:41.548]  People tend to look the other way or even prove of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners with no charges.
[02:40:42.108 --> 02:40:46.352]  Identifying enemies or scapegoats as a unifying cause.
[02:40:47.213 --> 02:40:54.699]  Like people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe.
[02:40:55.320 --> 02:40:56.821]  Supremacy of the military.
[02:40:57.281 --> 02:41:02.806]  Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding
[02:41:04.082 --> 02:41:05.803]  Rampant sexism.
[02:41:06.923 --> 02:41:08.423]  Controlled mass media.
[02:41:09.904 --> 02:41:12.585]  Obsession with national security.
[02:41:13.845 --> 02:41:16.626]  Religion and government are intertwined.
[02:41:17.226 --> 02:41:27.109]  Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.
[02:41:28.129 --> 02:41:31.410]  Number nine, corporate power is protected.
[02:41:32.722 --> 02:41:35.304]  Number 10, labor power is suppressed.
[02:41:36.365 --> 02:41:39.447]  Number 11, disdain for intellectuals and the arts.
[02:41:40.267 --> 02:41:42.769]  Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.
[02:41:43.189 --> 02:41:46.131]  Number 12, obsession with crime and punishment.
[02:41:46.671 --> 02:41:50.834]  Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce the laws.
[02:41:52.075 --> 02:41:54.837]  Number 13, rampant cronyism and corruption.
[02:41:55.658 --> 02:41:59.180]  And number 14, fraudulent elections.
[02:42:00.532 --> 02:42:03.574]  Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham.
[02:42:05.456 --> 02:42:11.441]  Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.
[02:42:12.201 --> 02:42:20.048]  Of the 14 defining characteristics of fascism, Bush's America falls neatly into all 14 categories.
[02:42:20.648 --> 02:42:21.489]  Do you disagree?
[02:42:22.785 --> 02:42:27.808]  Alright, and that video to the audio is on Infowars.com.
[02:42:28.408 --> 02:42:33.751]  Right now, and I'm actually going to write some of my own comments on this in the post of the 14th, but they're saying nationalism.
[02:42:33.811 --> 02:42:39.215]  Bush is actually getting rid of our real nationalism while using a fake nationalism to bring us into the new world order.
[02:42:39.595 --> 02:42:47.179]  But it is true that fascist systems do manipulate nationalism and do that, and they do manipulate religion, and they do do a lot of these things.
[02:42:49.514 --> 02:42:52.535]  In this fascist state, they're breaking down the authority of the man.
[02:42:52.915 --> 02:42:53.976]  Hitler actually did that.
[02:42:53.996 --> 02:42:57.617]  He said, first you get the women, then you got the children, so follow the men.
[02:42:58.317 --> 02:43:02.419]  And so, that's kind of a leftward analysis of fascism.
[02:43:02.459 --> 02:43:06.500]  A little bit skewed, but still pretty effective to get people thinking.
[02:43:06.520 --> 02:43:09.341]  You've got 20 seconds to finish up there.
[02:43:09.921 --> 02:43:10.581]  Rick, go ahead.
[02:43:11.122 --> 02:43:11.742]  Not Rick, Tim.
[02:43:12.142 --> 02:43:24.608]  Yeah, I just want to tell you, I missed the first hour, and I can't not believe Alex, the unbelievable synchronicity between our collective consciousness, because I brought this stuff totally out of the blue after the elections when I finally did call through to you.
[02:43:24.728 --> 02:43:26.669]  I can't believe that you played it earlier and I missed it.
[02:43:26.689 --> 02:43:31.071]  That is just so, you know... Great minds think alike, and you got the great one.
[02:43:31.111 --> 02:43:32.271]  Now, thanks for the call, Tim.
[02:43:32.311 --> 02:43:32.851]  I appreciate it.
[02:43:33.091 --> 02:43:35.773]  Elizabeth in Maryland, quickly, I've got to get to these news.
[02:43:35.793 --> 02:43:36.353]  Go ahead, Elizabeth.
[02:43:37.200 --> 02:43:37.901]  Hello, Alex.
[02:43:38.301 --> 02:43:39.122]  Yes, welcome.
[02:43:39.802 --> 02:43:40.322]  Thank you.
[02:43:40.442 --> 02:43:42.364]  You're a brother and I'm your sister.
[02:43:42.584 --> 02:43:45.166]  You know how you changed my life to be a broadcaster.
[02:43:45.206 --> 02:43:52.451]  June 2nd, 2003, when I heard you telling how the elite tortured and harmed the children.
[02:43:52.791 --> 02:43:54.192]  And I had never heard you before.
[02:43:54.573 --> 02:43:57.755]  I was in the process of writing a book, and it's finally done too.
[02:43:57.816 --> 02:44:01.739]  But I had even written about you in my book, but I had never heard you.
[02:44:02.199 --> 02:44:11.628]  So, you've changed my life, and I want to say that today, it's a masterstroke of genius to have these 14 qualities of fascism and Catherine Aldrecht.
[02:44:12.068 --> 02:44:19.575]  And Alex, I wanted to ask you, when she was talking about the networking, can't you see how this could lead to a ghettoization of Christians?
[02:44:20.268 --> 02:44:21.710]  Oh, that's what it's going to be all about.
[02:44:21.730 --> 02:44:25.414]  They're going to say, OK, Christians, you don't have to do this.
[02:44:25.434 --> 02:44:27.135]  And all the Christian leaders will say, do it.
[02:44:27.196 --> 02:44:28.016]  It's of the Lord.
[02:44:28.297 --> 02:44:30.739]  It stops the terrorists that work for the devil.
[02:44:31.140 --> 02:44:37.627]  But then for the crazy cult Christians that don't want to do it, they'll put us in ghettos and then pull Waco-style events on us.
[02:44:38.127 --> 02:44:43.072]  Yes, and do you think the faith-based initiatives, all that stuff is going to help lead it farther?
[02:44:43.112 --> 02:44:50.580]  Nine billion dollars a year of money to the churches to start off is going to pave the way for them to all parrot how great the new world order is, Elizabeth.
[02:44:50.841 --> 02:44:54.344]  And you know, you had a caller who was kind of meek, worried.
[02:44:54.564 --> 02:44:55.145]  We've got to
[02:44:55.265 --> 02:44:55.906]  It's unbelievable.
[02:44:56.006 --> 02:44:57.527]  Elizabeth, you keep it up and God bless.
[02:44:57.567 --> 02:44:59.629]  Send me a copy of your book whenever you want.
[02:45:18.470 --> 02:45:24.999]  Contrary to what people say, Christians have no duty whatsoever to help establish the political structures of the new age.
[02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:29.486]  In fact, we have an affirmative duty to help resist them, even unto death.
[02:45:29.586 --> 02:45:29.966]  I hear you.
[02:45:30.006 --> 02:45:30.687]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:30.727 --> 02:45:34.693]  Well, look, if we're supposed to worship whatever the government says, then we shouldn't have fought Hitler.
[02:45:35.305 --> 02:45:37.125]  We're supposed to worship whatever the government says.
[02:45:37.505 --> 02:45:40.246]  Why were 11 of the 12 disciples murdered by government?
[02:45:40.826 --> 02:45:41.826]  It isn't true.
[02:45:41.926 --> 02:45:45.127]  It's godly government, if it's godly government, that we're supposed to follow.
[02:45:45.807 --> 02:45:49.247]  Folks, we are... Why did Christ whip the money changers?
[02:45:49.267 --> 02:45:49.948]  That was the government.
[02:45:50.448 --> 02:45:51.268]  It's a lie.
[02:45:51.368 --> 02:45:56.989]  Hitler's favorite Bible verse was that Romans quote about rendering unto Caesar.
[02:45:57.729 --> 02:45:58.629]  Last call here, folks.
[02:45:58.649 --> 02:46:00.049]  I've got a lot of news I want to jam in here.
[02:46:00.810 --> 02:46:01.130]  Mike.
[02:46:01.650 --> 02:46:02.470]  Mike, last call.
[02:46:02.490 --> 02:46:03.170]  Where are you calling from?
[02:46:03.852 --> 02:46:06.594]  I'm going to be real quick.
[02:46:06.974 --> 02:46:09.656]  Basically, I just found an article on Yahoo.
[02:46:09.676 --> 02:46:10.917]  It's from the Associated Press.
[02:46:11.498 --> 02:46:14.240]  The title is, First Amendment, No Big Deal, Students Say.
[02:46:15.240 --> 02:46:21.185]  It was a million dollar study by James L. Knight Foundation.
[02:46:21.245 --> 02:46:26.969]  Yeah, that was a year ago, and the majority think the First Amendment should be gotten rid of, yeah.
[02:46:27.109 --> 02:46:29.190]  Or is that a new study?
[02:46:29.210 --> 02:46:30.011]  I think it's the same one.
[02:46:30.678 --> 02:46:34.939]  I said it just posted 21 minutes ago, and it is from... Must be a new survey!
[02:46:34.979 --> 02:46:35.920]  What are the numbers now?
[02:46:37.680 --> 02:46:40.461]  Numbers... I haven't gone through them quite at all.
[02:46:40.801 --> 02:46:48.483]  What they do say here in the text is more than one in three high school students say that First Amendment goes too far, and the right to guarantees.
[02:46:48.863 --> 02:46:53.885]  Only half the students said that newspapers should be allowed to publish freely without government approval authority.
[02:46:55.005 --> 02:46:58.466]  Yeah, the numbers were worse last year, so I guess we're having some effect.
[02:46:59.361 --> 02:47:00.282]  Sounds like freedom, though.
[02:47:00.302 --> 02:47:03.103]  They're doing a good job in the schools, teaching us that the government should run our lives.
[02:47:03.864 --> 02:47:04.604]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:47:04.844 --> 02:47:06.405]  Yeah, they got quite a system set up there.
[02:47:07.186 --> 02:47:08.386]  Good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:47:08.426 --> 02:47:08.887]  Take care.
[02:47:08.907 --> 02:47:14.830]  This out of the New York Times, security nominee gave advice to the CIA on torture laws.
[02:47:15.571 --> 02:47:21.174]  Michael Chertoff, who has been picked by President Bush to be the Homeland Security Secretary, advises the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:47:22.603 --> 02:47:26.307]  On the legality, of course, of interrogation methods, you know it as torture.
[02:47:26.927 --> 02:47:39.899]  On terrorist suspects, under the federal anti-torture statute, current and former administrative officials said this week, depending on the circumstances, he told the intelligence agency some course of methods could be legal, but he advised against others, the officials said.
[02:47:40.459 --> 02:47:43.782]  And then Alberto Gonzales got right down to how to torture people to death.
[02:47:44.383 --> 02:47:46.705]  So again, all the actual architects of this
[02:47:47.788 --> 02:47:49.549]  Being put into the higher levels.
[02:47:50.050 --> 02:47:52.352]  Talk about corruption over in Germany.
[02:47:52.512 --> 02:47:56.175]  If you don't take a job as a prostitute, you can stop your benefits.
[02:47:56.535 --> 02:48:04.962]  A 25-year-old waitress who turned down a job providing sexual services at a brothel in Berlin faces possible cuts to her unemployment benefit under laws introduced this year.
[02:48:06.173 --> 02:48:16.275]  Prostitution was legalized in Germany just over two years ago and the brothel owners who must pay a tax in employee health insurance were granted access to official database of job seekers.
[02:48:16.795 --> 02:48:24.257]  The waitress and unemployed information technology professional had said that she was willing to work in a bar at night and had worked in a cafe.
[02:48:24.937 --> 02:48:31.558]  But she was told by the job center you will lose your jobless benefits unless you go sign up to be a whore.
[02:48:32.498 --> 02:48:35.039]  A job that's got a really high chance of killing you.
[02:48:35.942 --> 02:48:37.463]  How about some cervical cancer?
[02:48:37.483 --> 02:48:38.604]  How about some HIV?
[02:48:38.624 --> 02:48:39.745]  How about some hepatitis?
[02:48:40.126 --> 02:48:43.588]  If you don't go do it, then you don't get your welfare.
[02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:50.274]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.454 --> 02:48:54.898]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.018 --> 02:48:59.402]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.442 --> 02:49:00.783]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.503 --> 02:49:02.524]  Panama.
[02:49:02.564 --> 02:49:06.787]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.847 --> 02:49:13.791]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.892 --> 02:49:15.973]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.273 --> 02:49:26.740]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.920 --> 02:49:29.042]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is,
[02:49:29.462 --> 02:49:30.664]  This is my new two and a half hour video.
[02:49:30.684 --> 02:49:32.306]  Police State 3 is for you!
[02:49:32.786 --> 02:49:35.390]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[02:49:35.410 --> 02:49:35.991]  Or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.031 --> 02:49:36.552]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.572 --> 02:49:37.833]  Order today and spread the word!
[02:49:45.283 --> 02:49:48.324]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[02:49:48.624 --> 02:49:53.545]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:53.805 --> 02:49:58.165]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:58.446 --> 02:50:07.367]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[02:51:50.680 --> 02:51:52.581]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:53.041 --> 02:51:55.863]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.424 --> 02:51:57.924]  Report!
[02:51:58.044 --> 02:51:58.344]  U.S.
[02:51:58.404 --> 02:52:02.607]  Occupation Authority in Iraq lost track of nearly 9 billion dollars.
[02:52:02.627 --> 02:52:05.468]  This is from the government, Voice of America, and on it by a U.S.
[02:52:05.508 --> 02:52:06.529]  inspector says U.S.
[02:52:06.569 --> 02:52:13.813]  led authority that governed Iraq after the 2003 invasion failed to keep track of nearly 9 billion and transferred to Iraqi ministries.
[02:52:15.245 --> 02:52:20.968]  Folks, a few years ago it was 1.2 trillion missing from the Pentagon in the last nine years.
[02:52:21.168 --> 02:52:27.311]  Now, just since then, it's another, get this, trillion-two.
[02:52:28.171 --> 02:52:28.912]  Double that!
[02:52:28.992 --> 02:52:33.174]  I mean, how do you steal a trillion-two?
[02:52:33.494 --> 02:52:34.755]  You wonder what the New World Order is about?
[02:52:34.995 --> 02:52:37.136]  It's about having a police state so they can do all this.
[02:52:38.296 --> 02:52:39.437]  So it's now 2,400,000,000,000,000 in the last ten years.
[02:52:42.185 --> 02:52:45.247]  Lip implant tissue link with mad cow disease.
[02:52:45.807 --> 02:52:50.550]  One in six cosmetic surgery firms may be closed as fears of patients' health prompts a clampdown.
[02:52:50.890 --> 02:52:54.212]  And they've also found a goat confirmed with CJD.
[02:52:54.652 --> 02:52:57.373]  We've already known it could be in pork, it could be in chickens, it could be in anything.
[02:52:58.234 --> 02:53:01.676]  Because they feed rotten other animals to all these things and put it in the meal.
[02:53:03.977 --> 02:53:06.078]  CIA refuses to release Nazi papers.
[02:53:06.558 --> 02:53:09.140]  UPI reporting that masses of Nazi documents
[02:53:11.437 --> 02:53:19.782]  1.2 million pages have been released, but the CIA refuses to release the pages about how they protected and used the Nazis to set up our modern form of intelligence agencies.
[02:53:20.342 --> 02:53:22.343]  That's the loving Nazi connection there.
[02:53:22.363 --> 02:53:27.285]  I'm being sarcastic when I say loving, but anything evil is good today, so it must be good.
[02:53:27.405 --> 02:53:28.106]  I think it's bad.
[02:53:28.906 --> 02:53:32.288]  Bilderberg plans spring scheming session.
[02:53:32.987 --> 02:53:36.951]  We're going to be having Big Jim Tucker on very soon to talk about this before he goes to the Bloomberg Group.
[02:53:37.291 --> 02:53:48.323]  The Bloomberg Steering Committee was exposed holding its winter meeting at a nostalgic location, the Bloomberg Hotel in Holland, where the secret society got its name in 1954.
[02:53:49.344 --> 02:53:56.111]  And the meeting was discovered by Kirk Roushens of the Foreign Press Foundation.
[02:53:57.112 --> 02:53:59.595]  And that was a little steering meeting.
[02:53:59.635 --> 02:54:01.696]  Now there's going to be another one and we're going to be covering that.
[02:54:01.736 --> 02:54:03.318]  But we'll have Jim Tucker on about this.
[02:54:03.618 --> 02:54:07.422]  The Bilderberg Conference is taking place in Oozerbeek.
[02:54:07.842 --> 02:54:17.551]  But the chances of getting invited or even getting some normal press information is as big a chance as a snowball has in Hades, he wrote.
[02:54:19.315 --> 02:54:22.918]  So we'll be going over that for you as well.
[02:54:22.938 --> 02:54:25.280]  They have these little steering meetings and then their official meetings.
[02:54:25.781 --> 02:54:29.824]  Another globalist meeting, this one that's public, not to the public, but their proceedings are public.
[02:54:30.324 --> 02:54:32.566]  Bono and a bunch of others went there.
[02:54:32.626 --> 02:54:33.707]  Sharon Stone went there.
[02:54:34.428 --> 02:54:37.410]  And it's Davos touches the MTV generation.
[02:54:37.691 --> 02:54:40.673]  It was the most caring, sharing world economic forum yet.
[02:54:41.474 --> 02:54:46.238]  But do move stars, politics, and business really mix?
[02:54:47.688 --> 02:54:51.351]  And it gets into, well, how our world government's going to take good care of us.
[02:54:51.411 --> 02:54:56.396]  And three years ago, they talked about how they were going to plunge the dollar and bring us into this new world order.
[02:54:56.436 --> 02:55:02.261]  A lot of interesting stuff always comes out of the Davos Switzerland Forum, usually in the mainstream media.
[02:55:02.581 --> 02:55:05.744]  Now it's just how it's become Hollywoodized.
[02:55:06.497 --> 02:55:07.378]  If that's a word.
[02:55:07.858 --> 02:55:09.479]  Hollywood eyes, yes.
[02:55:10.280 --> 02:55:22.509]  Out of the London Independent, my nightmare of torture and assault by a Briton held in Guantanamo, the raping, the torturing, and it's admitted this is part of their torture technique is to do perverted things to them.
[02:55:23.390 --> 02:55:31.316]  I mean, it's not just that they're torturing them, it's pervert type stuff on top of it, which is what we see serial killers doing, and then they openly announce it
[02:55:31.903 --> 02:55:33.144]  Like it's no big deal.
[02:55:33.164 --> 02:55:34.364]  Another one here out of Reuters.
[02:55:34.864 --> 02:55:41.708]  Australian ex-Guantanamo inmate mentally scarred, his lawyer says, and gets into all of that type of torture.
[02:55:41.748 --> 02:55:45.909]  And an article out of the BBC, terror plans not internment.
[02:55:46.350 --> 02:55:58.815]  Yes, they say that they'll round everybody up and put them in camps, but this particular lord in the House of Lords said that it's not an abuse of power, and it's not internment, it's just rest and relocation centers.
[02:55:58.875 --> 02:56:00.076]  So you should go to the website and
[02:56:00.896 --> 02:56:01.637]  Read the rest of it.
[02:56:01.677 --> 02:56:04.379]  Another report here out of WSWS.
[02:56:04.699 --> 02:56:07.681]  Report documents tortured by U.S.-backed Iraqi police.
[02:56:08.481 --> 02:56:12.584]  They're doing a great job of doing all of that.
[02:56:12.764 --> 02:56:13.284]  Here's another one.
[02:56:13.544 --> 02:56:14.625]  Don't do your homework.
[02:56:14.705 --> 02:56:16.066]  Students could end up in court.
[02:56:16.466 --> 02:56:17.487]  Been going on for years.
[02:56:17.807 --> 02:56:19.328]  Don't finish all your homework.
[02:56:19.388 --> 02:56:20.609]  It is now a crime.
[02:56:21.549 --> 02:56:24.791]  All about getting you into the criminal justice system.
[02:56:25.111 --> 02:56:28.233]  And a new national ID card law introduced to even beef it up.
[02:56:28.734 --> 02:56:29.214]  That's on
[02:56:29.921 --> 02:56:31.045]  PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:56:31.305 --> 02:56:32.248]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:32.288 --> 02:56:33.211]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:33.271 --> 02:56:33.692]  God bless.
