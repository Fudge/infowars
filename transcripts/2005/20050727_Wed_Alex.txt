[00:00:05.876 --> 00:00:06.496]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.177 --> 00:00:08.198]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.939 --> 00:00:10.041]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.701 --> 00:00:11.522]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.283 --> 00:00:13.164]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.845 --> 00:00:17.710]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.095]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.733 --> 00:00:29.593]  We're good to go.
[00:00:51.118 --> 00:01:02.768]  ...was meant to kick-start the Cold War rather than end the Second World War, according to two nuclear historians who say they have new evidence backing the controversial theory.
[00:01:02.788 --> 00:01:04.330]  Well, I already read that as a fact.
[00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.092]  I mean, that's even been on the History Channel.
[00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:11.076]  And I'm not saying everything on the History Channel is fact, but they do have the documents.
[00:01:11.096 --> 00:01:17.141]  That was years ago that the Japanese, a month before, unconditionally surrendered...
[00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:23.988]  And our government would not respond to their overtures, and went ahead and A-bombed them.
[00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:30.350]  The media said to scare the Russians, but it came out it was to actually start an arms race.
[00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.930]  Oh, yeah.
[00:01:31.671 --> 00:01:35.592]  Military-industrial complex was taking over the entire economy, becoming very powerful.
[00:01:36.132 --> 00:01:37.473]  They didn't want the war to end.
[00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:38.473]  Got to have a new enemy.
[00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:44.435]  After all, our banks, along with London, helped put Lenin in and Stalin.
[00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:46.836]  So we're going to have a little party here.
[00:01:48.297 --> 00:02:00.790]  So that's coming up a little bit later with Dr. Peter Kuznick, director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University in Washington, D.C.
[00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.652]  It was not just a war.
[00:02:02.692 --> 00:02:05.035]  It was a crime against humanity.
[00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:10.801]  I know a lot of sickos out there like to talk about nuking children or day-bombing children.
[00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:13.435]  You lick your lips, you feel powerful.
[00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:16.798]  The globalists, they don't care about Japanese children.
[00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:21.521]  They don't care about your children they're pushing Ritalin and Prozac on.
[00:02:22.182 --> 00:02:25.224]  And they're putting sodium fluoride and stannous fluoride in their water.
[00:02:25.724 --> 00:02:29.907]  And they're giving them soft drinks and foods loaded with aspartame that causes leukemia.
[00:02:30.708 --> 00:02:31.848]  So shut up!
[00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.570]  Shut up!
[00:02:35.671 --> 00:02:41.015]  When somebody tries to surrender unconditionally, you don't drop A-bombs on them.
[00:02:42.904 --> 00:02:43.465]  All right, sorry.
[00:02:44.466 --> 00:02:44.746]  Sorry.
[00:02:46.608 --> 00:02:55.718]  All right, so that is... Oh, by the way, and then let all their general staff live and let the emperor get away with it and the scientists that did biological testing on our troops.
[00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.742]  Our government actually hired them and gave them laboratories.
[00:02:59.202 --> 00:03:00.604]  Oh, you did a great thing.
[00:03:01.264 --> 00:03:02.045]  Oh, that's public.
[00:03:03.126 --> 00:03:04.288]  So I don't want to hear it, scum.
[00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.510]  I mean, if they'd have taken the whole Japanese leadership and hung them high, that'd be fine with me.
[00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.411]  But you don't A-bomb innocent people.
[00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.132]  Now, I'm ranting.
[00:03:13.572 --> 00:03:14.192]  I'm ranting.
[00:03:14.832 --> 00:03:15.953]  I'm just so many people.
[00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:18.914]  I hear them on talk radio and reading news articles.
[00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:22.335]  Good thing we A-bombed them Japs.
[00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:27.437]  Saved hundreds of thousands of American lives.
[00:03:28.478 --> 00:03:31.799]  They was preparing to defend the mainland.
[00:03:33.706 --> 00:03:36.408]  No, they'd unconditionally transmitted that they would surrender.
[00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.590]  Unconditionally.
[00:03:39.991 --> 00:03:42.353]  Oh, well, just begging on your knees.
[00:03:42.393 --> 00:03:45.075]  Here, let us A-bomb two non-military cities.
[00:03:45.655 --> 00:03:51.239]  By the way, those were the cities that had been deemed safe, non-military, where everybody sent their children and families.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.242]  Just like some of the cities that were bombed in Deutschland.
[00:03:57.144 --> 00:03:57.904]  The same M.O.
[00:03:57.984 --> 00:03:58.785]  over and over again.
[00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:01.191]  U.S.
[00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:06.233]  reviews Mexico travel warning as killing's mount.
[00:04:07.354 --> 00:04:13.356]  Yes, they've renewed the travel warning, and what's interesting is, this travel warning actually made the news.
[00:04:14.456 --> 00:04:19.298]  It is now as dangerous as going to Israel or South Africa.
[00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.701]  I don't recommend getting near the Texas border, hundreds dead,
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.701]  Including five police on our side.
[00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.683]  The last two weeks, five on their side.
[00:04:32.544 --> 00:04:34.646]  Absolute bedlam.
[00:04:36.687 --> 00:04:38.528]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.310]  Hundreds of Americans have been kidnapped.
[00:04:42.871 --> 00:04:45.173]  It is totally out of control.
[00:04:45.493 --> 00:04:49.316]  And wow, the travel advisory actually made the newswire.
[00:04:50.897 --> 00:04:54.800]  The border is wide open and the border patrol has been ordered not to shoot back.
[00:04:55.655 --> 00:04:58.257]  We are actually under military attack right now.
[00:05:01.299 --> 00:05:02.820]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.082]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.222 --> 00:05:10.124]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.164 --> 00:05:14.407]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.747 --> 00:05:18.530]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.471]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:28.720]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.923]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:05:32.103 --> 00:05:34.967]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:41.574]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:42.774]  Go to my website, Infowars.com.
[00:06:01.238 --> 00:06:04.242]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:06:04.583 --> 00:06:13.414]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:06:13.735 --> 00:06:18.401]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:25.583]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:06:25.983 --> 00:06:37.767]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:38.247 --> 00:06:42.712]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:06:42.872 --> 00:06:45.315]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:45.355 --> 00:06:47.177]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:07:02.722 --> 00:07:04.142]  Pain, illness and disease.
[00:07:04.322 --> 00:07:07.483]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach.
[00:07:07.703 --> 00:07:12.764]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:13.024 --> 00:07:20.926]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:28.128]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:28.348 --> 00:07:29.569]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:29.709 --> 00:07:33.111]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:33.171 --> 00:07:34.291]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:34.572 --> 00:07:35.852]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:36.053 --> 00:07:42.896]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:50.480]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:08:09.037 --> 00:08:10.138]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.778 --> 00:08:11.678]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.358 --> 00:08:13.279]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.299 --> 00:08:17.780]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.262]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.843 --> 00:08:27.784]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now 8 minutes and 27 seconds.
[00:08:27.824 --> 00:08:29.185]  Second segment, end of this.
[00:08:30.763 --> 00:08:39.567]  Wednesday, transmission against the New World Order, the forces of global slave state that are being constructed.
[00:08:41.068 --> 00:08:48.731]  Coming up in about an hour, we're going to be talking to a guest who has now discovered even more documents.
[00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:52.173]  The new scientists picked up on this back on Friday.
[00:08:52.193 --> 00:08:58.076]  The Japanese had surrendered, and they were just A-bombed.
[00:08:59.778 --> 00:09:03.540]  To actually start a weapons race with the Soviets and a Cold War.
[00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:03.960]  No kidding.
[00:09:06.041 --> 00:09:20.067]  Also, all over the United States, as children prepare in the next month to go back to their government training camps and their private schools as well that are becoming federally regulated and mandated and manipulated...
[00:09:21.576 --> 00:09:24.077]  There are TV reports all over the country.
[00:09:24.518 --> 00:09:32.902]  They're all almost identical, word for word, just a different news talking head, saying it's the law, you've got to take shots.
[00:09:33.702 --> 00:09:38.665]  It's the law, you've got to take your injections.
[00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:42.947]  And you know we've played the clips many times from last year.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.222]  Where local CBS News reported, Mercury is nutritious and good for you.
[00:09:48.642 --> 00:09:49.942]  It helps your brain.
[00:09:49.962 --> 00:09:54.404]  A new study finds, yes, a new federally paid for study.
[00:09:54.804 --> 00:09:56.565]  Mercury is good for your brain.
[00:09:56.625 --> 00:10:04.948]  We have that audio and video link on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and an article we just posted on infowars.com.
[00:10:05.368 --> 00:10:11.470]  Schools lie to parents and children, say vaccinations are mandatory.
[00:10:12.523 --> 00:10:14.364]  And, boy, it's really heating up.
[00:10:14.424 --> 00:10:19.207]  Last night on TV and on the radio this morning and in the newspaper, it's the law!
[00:10:19.707 --> 00:10:21.048]  You could be arrested!
[00:10:21.488 --> 00:10:23.989]  You've got to give your children the shots!
[00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:32.214]  If they don't take the shots, this has been on the news, then they'll be truant, and then you and your children will be arrested!
[00:10:33.675 --> 00:10:33.975]  What?
[00:10:35.822 --> 00:10:39.224]  And they never tell you there's no law you have to be vaccinated.
[00:10:39.644 --> 00:10:43.186]  There's an interdepartmental state regulation.
[00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:44.606]  This is the same for all 50 states.
[00:10:45.767 --> 00:10:48.928]  And they ask you to give them a waiver form.
[00:10:49.208 --> 00:10:50.789]  But see, they don't even tell you there's a waiver form.
[00:10:50.829 --> 00:10:54.231]  They just say, it's the law, you've got to do it or you'll be arrested.
[00:10:56.359 --> 00:11:02.202]  And then if you happen to know about the waiver form, let me just tell you that they've been told they've got to get that.
[00:11:02.242 --> 00:11:06.904]  There's no law you've even got to have that, because there is no law you've got to take the shots.
[00:11:08.845 --> 00:11:14.207]  So we're going to get into that and also get into our little audio vault and play that clip one more time.
[00:11:14.247 --> 00:11:23.051]  It's going to be the all-time most out-of-control clip, and people, every time I mention it without playing it, don't believe that I have that clip.
[00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:46.879]  They don't believe that I actually... And by the way, that day that we saw the clip, I got home at night after I aired the clip on my TV show, and I typed in their headline, and it popped up on hundreds of CBS TV affiliates from Albuquerque, New Mexico, to upstate New York, to Pensacola, Florida.
[00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:49.920]  CBS everywhere.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.661]  So what they do is a lot of their newscasts are packaged...
[00:11:53.528 --> 00:12:00.813]  That is like, say, their Health Watch, and it's the same for ABC and Fox and all of them, and even the cities that have CNN affiliates.
[00:12:01.274 --> 00:12:02.675]  Austin even has a CNN affiliate.
[00:12:02.975 --> 00:12:04.376]  And I've talked to the employees of these places.
[00:12:04.796 --> 00:12:09.159]  Most of what they get are canned news feeds with video images.
[00:12:09.179 --> 00:12:13.802]  So it's good for them because they have limited staff, and they're lazy, and it's all packaged.
[00:12:14.123 --> 00:12:15.784]  So they send them a limited news feed.
[00:12:16.658 --> 00:12:26.782]  That they then cut in live and talk over, reading off a teleprompter script that was also emailed to them, along with the newscast that was satellited down to them.
[00:12:28.343 --> 00:12:32.345]  And so all over the country, people heard the exact same thing, but with the local flair.
[00:12:33.045 --> 00:12:39.548]  And studies show people trust local news many times more than they trust national news.
[00:12:40.748 --> 00:12:42.769]  National news, people know, is propaganda.
[00:12:43.129 --> 00:12:44.590]  It's lost almost all credibility.
[00:12:45.665 --> 00:12:48.127]  But local news still has that credibility.
[00:12:48.567 --> 00:12:50.629]  We have to discredit that credibility.
[00:12:51.049 --> 00:12:52.590]  That is very important.
[00:12:53.371 --> 00:13:04.098]  Now, there still are a lot of original reports done by local news, original crime investigations or corruption investigations or local news, where you've got real reporters out doing news.
[00:13:04.138 --> 00:13:09.342]  But notice, that's been relegated to three or four minutes per 30-minute newscast now.
[00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:12.064]  That's been cut way down.
[00:13:13.028 --> 00:13:17.812]  And they're laying more and more people off where more and more of it is just canned, regurgitated.
[00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:21.535]  So be sure and support local newscasts that are local.
[00:13:22.036 --> 00:13:25.959]  Alright, I'm diatribing now about the media, but this is very important.
[00:13:26.019 --> 00:13:29.102]  So I wrote a little article this morning, and we'll get to it.
[00:13:29.963 --> 00:13:31.144]  Of course, U.S.
[00:13:31.304 --> 00:13:35.027]  renews Mexico travel warning as killings mount.
[00:13:36.027 --> 00:13:51.217]  Now, no one talked about, except for the Brownsville paper and a few Arizona papers, about a federal travel advisory, State Department advisory, for South Texas and Southern Arizona.
[00:13:52.173 --> 00:13:54.074]  Now, you wonder why the Minutemen are so upset.
[00:13:54.194 --> 00:14:01.658]  I mean, they're robbed, they're killed, they're raped, their homes are burned down, police are killed on a monthly basis, feds are killed.
[00:14:02.159 --> 00:14:08.262]  I mean, the poor Mexicans sneaking across are literally fed on by these smugglers and coyotes.
[00:14:08.322 --> 00:14:10.183]  I mean, there are dead bodies all over the place.
[00:14:10.864 --> 00:14:15.767]  I mean, just hundreds of dead bodies a year are found, and the media spins it as, oh, they died in the heat.
[00:14:16.747 --> 00:14:19.929]  And then a minor footnote with stab wounds or bullet holes in them.
[00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:23.934]  Or they've been robbed and beaten up and then died of exposure.
[00:14:25.395 --> 00:14:26.716]  I mean, folks, it's hellish.
[00:14:26.796 --> 00:14:30.718]  Listen, we've got local newscasts, again, breaking the national news monopoly.
[00:14:31.098 --> 00:14:36.041]  One of them is a local newscast from Laredo, and it's the people begging.
[00:14:36.181 --> 00:14:37.042]  Everyone's moving out.
[00:14:37.082 --> 00:14:37.762]  It's a big town.
[00:14:38.583 --> 00:14:40.444]  No one is there to buy the goods.
[00:14:40.464 --> 00:14:42.545]  I mean, I've gone there many times as a tourist growing up.
[00:14:44.076 --> 00:14:45.477]  No one is coming down there.
[00:14:45.958 --> 00:14:48.420]  They've got big, high-rise, you know, 15-story hotels.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.381]  Nobody's in them.
[00:14:49.641 --> 00:14:50.181]  It shows it.
[00:14:50.261 --> 00:14:50.982]  It's a ghost town.
[00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:54.144]  Because every day they're machine-gunning people.
[00:14:54.164 --> 00:14:55.005]  They're killing people.
[00:14:56.466 --> 00:14:57.307]  And who are they?
[00:14:57.347 --> 00:15:00.370]  They are Los Zetas and the gangs that work for them.
[00:15:00.390 --> 00:15:01.751]  They work for the CIA.
[00:15:01.771 --> 00:15:02.852]  They were trained by the U.S.
[00:15:02.872 --> 00:15:03.132]  government.
[00:15:03.152 --> 00:15:03.852]  It's mainstream news.
[00:15:04.853 --> 00:15:05.834]  And they're out killing.
[00:15:06.134 --> 00:15:08.356]  You see, cocaine and heroin prices have gone way down.
[00:15:08.376 --> 00:15:09.297]  And the globalists are angry.
[00:15:10.018 --> 00:15:24.901]  They're losing control of their monopoly, and just like De Beers, owned by the Oppenheimers with diamonds, they brag about how they hire 1,000-man Merck armies who will go into Sierra Leone, who will go into Africa, and they'll just start killing everybody.
[00:15:25.301 --> 00:15:36.583]  They'll go into the little private mines that have set up shop on private property, and they'll just kill everybody, and nobody enforces it, and it'll be a little BBC article, or they'll brag in the New Yorker magazine about it, the April issue back in 2000.
[00:15:37.003 --> 00:15:38.003]  I'll never forget that article.
[00:15:39.702 --> 00:15:40.683]  And that's the same thing.
[00:15:40.703 --> 00:15:42.004]  You know, they got private mercs.
[00:15:42.064 --> 00:15:50.389]  Well, our government now has over a thousand killer Mexican commandos, and they're just having a good old time.
[00:15:51.201 --> 00:15:52.482]  And they'll come across the U.S.
[00:15:52.522 --> 00:15:52.862]  border.
[00:15:53.002 --> 00:15:56.823]  They will grab hundreds of American citizens who are drug dealers.
[00:15:56.843 --> 00:16:00.104]  They will grab their families if the drug dealers are unable to get them.
[00:16:00.525 --> 00:16:03.686]  Women and children, they'll put them in big bivouacs inside courtyards.
[00:16:04.026 --> 00:16:04.806]  They'll execute them.
[00:16:04.826 --> 00:16:06.247]  They'll kill them.
[00:16:06.507 --> 00:16:13.489]  Mexican troops occasionally, because of big protests, or maybe they'll keep it quiet, will go in and try to save them.
[00:16:13.849 --> 00:16:14.830]  There's mass killings.
[00:16:14.890 --> 00:16:20.452]  I mean, folks, imagine if Muslims were kidnapping in the last two months over 100 American citizens.
[00:16:21.121 --> 00:16:21.681]  It's over 100.
[00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:22.622]  I have the articles right here.
[00:16:23.242 --> 00:16:24.383]  You imagine the news?
[00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:27.025]  Al-Qaeda's got 100 of our people held hostage.
[00:16:27.965 --> 00:16:29.826]  Continual 24-hour coverage.
[00:16:30.006 --> 00:16:30.907]  Dun, dun, dun.
[00:16:30.947 --> 00:16:32.188]  Fox, you can trust.
[00:16:32.228 --> 00:16:32.688]  Yeah.
[00:16:32.928 --> 00:16:34.629]  Fighting for America.
[00:16:34.789 --> 00:16:36.070]  Give your rights up.
[00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:37.411]  Get searched today.
[00:16:37.431 --> 00:16:38.352]  But no.
[00:16:40.211 --> 00:16:42.092]  Literally, Sean Hannity, we all need to be searched.
[00:16:42.492 --> 00:16:44.153]  I feel good being searched, every newscast.
[00:16:44.333 --> 00:16:45.273]  Being searched is good.
[00:16:45.353 --> 00:16:46.194]  I love being searched.
[00:16:46.454 --> 00:16:47.554]  It's incredible to be searched.
[00:16:47.574 --> 00:16:48.615]  It's so fun to be searched.
[00:16:48.815 --> 00:16:51.456]  Giving up our rights is good, and probable microchips is wonderful.
[00:16:53.257 --> 00:16:56.638]  Meanwhile, Al-Qaeda is going to kill us any minute, but this is going on.
[00:16:57.859 --> 00:16:58.739]  So this is Reuters.
[00:16:58.859 --> 00:16:59.220]  U.S.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:04.362]  reviews, renews Mexico travel warnings whose killings mount.
[00:17:05.143 --> 00:17:09.706]  The United States renewed a travel warning on Tuesday for U.S.
[00:17:09.746 --> 00:17:18.873]  citizens crossing the border into Mexico, noting more than 100 murders had occurred in the border region since June.
[00:17:19.913 --> 00:17:27.258]  Now, again, I've been announcing that 100 number for about a month or two, and I've got emails going, Well, read the news articles!
[00:17:27.298 --> 00:17:32.462]  We post like 60 articles a day on InfoWars, about 30 articles a day on Prison Planet.
[00:17:33.542 --> 00:17:40.424]  I mean, I don't know what I'm supposed to spoon to hand-deliver it to you, but here's Reuters today, and if you can't find it, then I'm sorry.
[00:17:42.385 --> 00:17:42.885]  The U.S.
[00:17:42.945 --> 00:17:56.990]  ambassador in Mexico, Tony Garza, said that with violence showing no sign of abating, the travel warning issued twice by Washington since the start of the year had been extended and would be renewed as necessary.
[00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:01.563]  And by the way, there are now eight towns flying Mexican flags.
[00:18:01.703 --> 00:18:02.664]  English is not allowed.
[00:18:02.784 --> 00:18:06.267]  Whites have been forcibly, and blacks as well, have been forcibly thrown out.
[00:18:06.667 --> 00:18:07.768]  Homes have been burned down.
[00:18:08.609 --> 00:18:10.330]  That's been in the South Texas newspapers.
[00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:12.332]  You'll never hear it on national news.
[00:18:12.352 --> 00:18:15.054]  Can you imagine if whites were running blacks out of towns?
[00:18:15.594 --> 00:18:17.095]  How big a news story that would be?
[00:18:17.876 --> 00:18:23.060]  Eight towns fly the Mexican flag, no English allowed, and the federal government loves it.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:24.601]  It's part of the breakdown of this country.
[00:18:26.415 --> 00:18:30.298]  18 Nuevo Leon policemen were killed this year, including eight in July.
[00:18:31.999 --> 00:18:33.000]  I'm sorry, I said five.
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:33.760]  There's been a few more.
[00:18:33.821 --> 00:18:34.101]  Sorry.
[00:18:35.061 --> 00:18:36.182]  See, it's worse than I said.
[00:18:36.222 --> 00:18:36.542]  I'm sorry.
[00:18:37.283 --> 00:18:43.567]  These disturbing reports make clear that Mexico needs to do much more to bring safety and security to our common border.
[00:18:44.128 --> 00:18:47.130]  And, of course, there's no mention of five dead cops on our side the last two months.
[00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:49.732]  Mexico... See, this is sick.
[00:18:50.507 --> 00:19:01.391]  Mexico, which has rejected angrily the previous travel alerts and accused Washington of interfering in its business, retorted with a short statement saying it was continuing its efforts to fight organized crime.
[00:19:02.432 --> 00:19:12.775]  As it was reiterated on various occasions, the government maintains a constant fight against organized crime and is undertaking a series of actions to quell violence on the border, the foreign ministry said in a short statement.
[00:19:13.095 --> 00:19:15.396]  Folks, it is Vicente Fox working for the U.S.
[00:19:15.436 --> 00:19:19.698]  government with his troops going after drug dealers that are not paying their cut.
[00:19:20.473 --> 00:19:23.035]  And most of the violence is our own government people.
[00:19:23.095 --> 00:19:23.736]  This is admitted.
[00:19:24.536 --> 00:19:24.977]  Healing.
[00:19:26.177 --> 00:19:27.839]  And you're going to see drug prices go up.
[00:19:27.879 --> 00:19:29.620]  I mean, they are really moving hard.
[00:19:30.421 --> 00:19:34.404]  The Bush crime family and their big banker owners are hitting them hard.
[00:19:35.405 --> 00:19:36.626]  All over the Southwest.
[00:19:37.006 --> 00:19:47.394]  They're blowing cars up in Dallas, machine gunning people in San Antonio, slitting throats, Columbia neckties in Houston, murders right here in Austin, back of the paper.
[00:19:48.169 --> 00:19:50.694]  I mean, we got cars blowing up, folks, okay?
[00:19:51.415 --> 00:19:53.579]  That you'll never hear at the national news.
[00:19:55.382 --> 00:19:56.544]  We're not kidding about this.
[00:19:56.564 --> 00:19:57.326]  This is hardcore.
[00:20:02.293 --> 00:20:05.114]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:20:05.214 --> 00:20:10.276]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:20:10.516 --> 00:20:16.678]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:20:16.958 --> 00:20:22.620]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:28.381]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease, and Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:20:28.622 --> 00:20:30.162]  That's why it's become the most popular immune
[00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:37.745]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95 and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:20:37.925 --> 00:20:38.745]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:20:38.926 --> 00:20:44.608]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:20:44.748 --> 00:20:48.950]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.051]  Well, with Agaricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:57.173]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[00:20:57.373 --> 00:20:59.714]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:21:02.165 --> 00:21:11.232]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:21:11.492 --> 00:21:22.720]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:21:23.061 --> 00:21:28.765]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[00:21:29.005 --> 00:21:29.265]  Thank you.
[00:21:29.285 --> 00:21:29.705]  Thank you.
[00:21:55.758 --> 00:21:56.679]  We're good to go.
[00:22:16.953 --> 00:22:30.301]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:22:30.781 --> 00:22:36.124]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:22:36.384 --> 00:22:42.268]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:22:42.568 --> 00:22:42.628]  1-800-686-2237
[00:23:02.222 --> 00:23:05.223]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[00:23:05.463 --> 00:23:12.344]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[00:23:12.684 --> 00:23:25.927]  For example, did you know that Live52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver disease since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:23:26.247 --> 00:23:26.988]  We're good to go.
[00:23:27.048 --> 00:23:27.328]  I think?
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:48.460]  Seriously, folks.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.201]  We got eight pounds flying the Mexican flag.
[00:24:18.533 --> 00:24:22.054]  That's been going on for about seven years.
[00:24:22.314 --> 00:24:23.434]  Now it's up to eight towns.
[00:24:24.095 --> 00:24:26.235]  No English allowed in the court proceedings.
[00:24:26.335 --> 00:24:27.296]  These are good-sized towns.
[00:24:27.596 --> 00:24:29.776]  El Cenizo was the first seven years ago to do it.
[00:24:31.617 --> 00:24:34.338]  We've got Mexican troops running around slaughtering people.
[00:24:34.398 --> 00:24:36.598]  We have the Los Zetas, admittedly trained by the U.S.
[00:24:36.638 --> 00:24:43.980]  government, expanding their numbers at training camps in South Texas with CIA merc types down there training them.
[00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:46.381]  They're running around killing all their competition.
[00:24:47.862 --> 00:24:49.003]  It's a reign of terror.
[00:24:49.063 --> 00:25:00.653]  We have our government hiring masses of Latin Americans, led by former death squad commanders, thousands of them leading the attacks and the torture and the arrest behind their black mask in Iraq.
[00:25:00.954 --> 00:25:01.554]  That's admitted.
[00:25:01.914 --> 00:25:03.896]  Our government hires mercs.
[00:25:04.076 --> 00:25:07.499]  And then 20 plus percent of our official U.S.
[00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:14.746]  Army ground troops in Baghdad, in Iraq, are Mexican, who weren't even American citizens.
[00:25:16.149 --> 00:25:22.854]  Who instantly got green cards when they joined the Marines or the Army, and now after a three-year stint, they become citizens.
[00:25:24.355 --> 00:25:31.080]  You know what it means when your government has a large portion of its soldiers being foreign?
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.342]  That's pure empire, folks.
[00:25:33.982 --> 00:25:35.743]  Literal foreign armies.
[00:25:37.384 --> 00:25:39.246]  This is so sick.
[00:25:39.926 --> 00:25:43.409]  And the globalists are moving almost all our assets, our money, our currency...
[00:25:44.494 --> 00:25:48.857]  The elite have decided America isn't a safe place to have their money.
[00:25:50.158 --> 00:25:51.399]  It's moving to China.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.381]  The factories already move there.
[00:25:54.421 --> 00:25:55.943]  The industrial base is moving there.
[00:25:56.343 --> 00:25:58.124]  Even weapons production is moving there.
[00:25:59.385 --> 00:26:05.630]  And by the way, the biggest exodus ever of Jews is now taking place out of the United States.
[00:26:06.781 --> 00:26:08.542]  To Europe and Israel.
[00:26:08.642 --> 00:26:12.805]  Israel is now the biggest concentration of Jews in the world.
[00:26:13.145 --> 00:26:15.947]  That number just changed from America to Israel.
[00:26:16.628 --> 00:26:18.889]  30 plus thousand have left just in the last few months.
[00:26:19.269 --> 00:26:21.171]  Why are they leaving the United States?
[00:26:25.694 --> 00:26:28.536]  So, this is what's going on to our country, folks.
[00:26:28.616 --> 00:26:31.858]  In our government, our banks pay for the Lurican-Keithson movements.
[00:26:31.898 --> 00:26:33.319]  The Fortune 500 pays for it.
[00:26:33.719 --> 00:26:34.880]  They put these people into power.
[00:26:34.920 --> 00:26:36.421]  They do not represent most Hispanics.
[00:26:37.608 --> 00:26:41.249]  But the Globals want to break this country down with ethnic strife, and they're doing it.
[00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:48.412]  So travel advisory, the third one to be issued, and finally it's in a major international newswire.
[00:26:49.152 --> 00:26:51.153]  But don't look for it on your nightly news.
[00:26:51.213 --> 00:26:55.034]  I mean, if you do see it on your nightly news, that is a first.
[00:26:58.535 --> 00:27:01.496]  And by the way, there should have always been a travel advisory.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:02.501]  We're good to go.
[00:27:21.624 --> 00:27:32.131]  Folks, they will just, if you have a fender bender, they will rob you, they will steal your children, put them in an orphanage, and they will run a credit report on you, and if you've got a million bucks, they're getting it all.
[00:27:32.732 --> 00:27:33.893]  And they'll suck your family dry.
[00:27:33.913 --> 00:27:35.794]  They'll say, 500,000, you go free.
[00:27:36.334 --> 00:27:37.235]  And then, oh, we want another 500,000.
[00:27:38.096 --> 00:27:39.156]  We see your grandmother.
[00:27:39.677 --> 00:27:41.698]  We see she is quite wealthy.
[00:27:42.359 --> 00:27:44.120]  Folks, I have family this has happened to.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:45.761]  We're going to get that money.
[00:27:45.841 --> 00:27:46.902]  Do you understand us?
[00:27:48.864 --> 00:27:58.588]  A lot of times they invite hunters down, but then if everything isn't perfectly inspected and authorized, or like if there's one casing of a bullet that hasn't been authorized, they take your truck, suck the money out of you.
[00:27:58.608 --> 00:28:06.072]  Construction workers go over there, you know, to advise them on certain specific stuff, and they'll find an old .22 shell under the seat.
[00:28:06.912 --> 00:28:07.992]  You know, who doesn't have that?
[00:28:08.733 --> 00:28:09.933]  And you've got guns.
[00:28:10.453 --> 00:28:11.114]  And boy, that's it.
[00:28:11.154 --> 00:28:11.754]  Your life's over.
[00:28:13.004 --> 00:28:18.468]  By the way, they don't feed you unless your family has to physically come and feed you in the jail.
[00:28:20.350 --> 00:28:23.432]  Oh, Mexico's so good.
[00:28:24.513 --> 00:28:25.554]  It's so nice.
[00:28:25.574 --> 00:28:26.795]  Why is everybody coming up here?
[00:28:26.875 --> 00:28:31.058]  Don't worry, we'll have more Dito and kickbacks and everything they got.
[00:28:31.379 --> 00:28:32.239]  It's already happening.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:33.781]  Beak dipping.
[00:28:35.162 --> 00:28:35.642]  All of it.
[00:28:35.662 --> 00:28:38.244]  You want to live in a third world chess pool?
[00:28:38.284 --> 00:28:38.985]  Welcome to it.
[00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:40.446]  We're going to be it.
[00:28:41.596 --> 00:28:43.357]  And so imagine, imagine.
[00:28:43.637 --> 00:28:45.837]  You know, we are 290-something million Americans.
[00:28:45.898 --> 00:28:49.639]  So hundreds of dead and dozens of dead police in the last year.
[00:28:49.659 --> 00:28:50.699]  Five dead U.S.
[00:28:50.939 --> 00:28:52.140]  police in the last few months.
[00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.961]  18 dead on their side in the last few months of police.
[00:28:56.781 --> 00:28:58.722]  If they just don't report on it, you don't care.
[00:28:59.042 --> 00:29:02.563]  But man, cops are all jittery right now at 7-Elevens looking at you when you walk in.
[00:29:02.723 --> 00:29:04.044]  They're all in here all over the country.
[00:29:04.244 --> 00:29:05.164]  Checkpoints everywhere.
[00:29:05.184 --> 00:29:07.585]  55 people died from bombs in England.
[00:29:07.785 --> 00:29:10.406]  Oh, we've got to flush the whole bill of rights down the toilet.
[00:29:11.849 --> 00:29:13.370]  Hundreds dead from Mexican trips.
[00:29:15.191 --> 00:29:16.532]  And that's just the last few months.
[00:29:18.233 --> 00:29:18.973]  Minor news!
[00:29:19.854 --> 00:29:21.175]  Out of sight, out of mind!
[00:29:22.475 --> 00:29:23.656]  Out of sight, out of mind!
[00:29:24.937 --> 00:29:25.677]  Can you imagine?
[00:29:25.697 --> 00:29:26.498]  You know what?
[00:29:26.878 --> 00:29:34.382]  If Muslims, if real Muslim terrorists even took people hostage, I think they could even keep that quiet and just kind of, well, yeah, but it's no big deal.
[00:29:34.402 --> 00:29:35.563]  Let's move on to something else.
[00:29:35.843 --> 00:29:37.444]  Because, again, they don't want to control the borders.
[00:29:37.804 --> 00:29:38.885]  They just ignore it.
[00:29:41.098 --> 00:29:43.539]  2,000 less Border Patrol on the southern border than there were on 9-11.
[00:29:43.679 --> 00:29:45.700]  Official government documents.
[00:29:46.401 --> 00:29:46.901]  It's admitted.
[00:29:47.361 --> 00:29:49.082]  We'll be right back with other vital news.
[00:29:51.803 --> 00:29:52.703]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.184 --> 00:29:54.784]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.804 --> 00:29:58.386]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:08.992]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.
[00:30:09.132 --> 00:30:13.313]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.
[00:30:13.553 --> 00:30:25.215]  By calling 1-888-PETS-911 or visiting 1-888-PETS-911.org, you will find the location of your closest adoption facility, as well as tons of other information you need to know as a responsible pet owner.
[00:30:25.375 --> 00:30:26.996]  So when thinking adoption, think Pets 911.
[00:30:30.948 --> 00:30:32.649]  Soon the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[00:30:32.849 --> 00:30:34.850]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[00:30:35.050 --> 00:30:35.731]  Prepare yourself.
[00:30:35.911 --> 00:30:39.613]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[00:30:49.858 --> 00:30:51.419]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[00:30:51.739 --> 00:30:54.501]  Get your free book The Bible Says by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[00:30:54.561 --> 00:30:55.301]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[00:31:01.081 --> 00:31:03.062]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[00:31:03.142 --> 00:31:13.868]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.229 --> 00:31:18.751]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.831 --> 00:31:30.158]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.578 --> 00:31:31.218]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.658 --> 00:32:07.921]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine, and I want to tell you about the Sacro Wedgie.
[00:32:08.461 --> 00:32:10.862]  I don't endorse many products, but I'm endorsing this one.
[00:32:11.162 --> 00:32:18.225]  If you've got back pain, sciatica, hip pain, leg pain, knee pain, then you need to listen very closely to this message.
[00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:26.785]  For more than 10 years now, the Sacro Wedgie has helped thousands find relief from the symptoms and pain of back problems.
[00:32:27.145 --> 00:32:29.045]  Now all you have to do is go to their website.
[00:32:29.305 --> 00:32:31.586]  You can read the testimonials and read all about it.
[00:32:32.126 --> 00:32:35.967]  On the internet, it is sacrowedgie.com.
[00:32:36.447 --> 00:32:41.328]  S-A-C-R-O-W-E-D-G-Y dot com.
[00:32:41.528 --> 00:32:42.988]  Sacrowedgie.com.
[00:32:43.528 --> 00:32:44.949]  Or you can use the toll-free number.
[00:32:44.969 --> 00:32:45.250]  1-800-737-9295.
[00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:45.490]  That's 737-9295.
[00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:45.770]  Call them.
[00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:46.050]  It's only $29.95.
[00:32:46.130 --> 00:32:47.291]  And it really works.
[00:32:47.311 --> 00:32:47.871]  Friendscripts!
[00:32:47.892 --> 00:32:47.952]  Woo!
[00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:33.928]  ...were created and published by the Associated Press and others when the Transportation Secretary Mineta, when he talked about how there was basically a stand-down and an order and the order stood.
[00:33:34.528 --> 00:33:36.350]  We know what that order was, the stand-down.
[00:33:38.977 --> 00:33:43.199]  And then C-SPAN claimed that all of their systems malfunctioned.
[00:33:45.159 --> 00:33:46.880]  And they would not sell the tape of that.
[00:33:48.301 --> 00:33:51.422]  Well, of course, there are dub houses here in Austin.
[00:33:51.442 --> 00:33:53.623]  They're called teleclips.
[00:33:53.963 --> 00:33:56.204]  They tape all the cable and TV.
[00:33:56.984 --> 00:34:00.105]  There were outfits that had tape, so people were able to get copies of it.
[00:34:00.743 --> 00:34:02.004]  I never spent the time or money to get it.
[00:34:02.284 --> 00:34:03.045]  We knew he said it.
[00:34:03.566 --> 00:34:05.868]  But that has been done, and the clip is out.
[00:34:05.908 --> 00:34:07.949]  It is on prisonplanet.com.
[00:34:08.310 --> 00:34:10.351]  Of that, we're going to play that coming up after some calls.
[00:34:11.833 --> 00:34:14.555]  A bunch of new, and I mean a bunch of new London bombing developments.
[00:34:15.176 --> 00:34:16.437]  There's just so much today.
[00:34:16.457 --> 00:34:21.421]  I mean, I was sitting there reading all the news last night and this morning, and I said, man, I've got to cover all this tomorrow.
[00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:27.266]  There's no way I can not cover some of this news because it's all so important.
[00:34:28.658 --> 00:34:33.401]  So Regina and Wolfgang and Dana and Chris and Robert, everybody, your calls are coming up.
[00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:34.741]  Don't forget to join us.
[00:34:34.941 --> 00:34:36.702]  Always good to get the number out, get some new callers.
[00:34:36.722 --> 00:34:36.902]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:36.922 --> 00:34:37.203]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:37.283 --> 00:34:41.705]  But I almost got up this morning, even earlier, and just get ready for the show at 4 a.m.
[00:34:41.725 --> 00:34:42.085]  so I could...
[00:34:54.255 --> 00:35:10.125]  So I could get in the car at 8 o'clock and already be done, get ready for the broadcast, and drive down to Zilker Park in downtown Austin and videotape just mass mind control in action, mass criminality in action.
[00:35:10.846 --> 00:35:11.606]  Really, it's criminal.
[00:35:12.647 --> 00:35:15.989]  Mass corruption in action, mass mind control in action.
[00:35:17.670 --> 00:35:18.630]  And you know what?
[00:35:18.691 --> 00:35:20.792]  I just said, hey, I'm about to go out of town.
[00:35:22.506 --> 00:35:26.008]  And I got too much going on, and I'm tired of having black circles around my eyes.
[00:35:26.148 --> 00:35:29.591]  I'll just write an article about it and link to some of the news stories about it.
[00:35:30.551 --> 00:35:36.515]  It would have been great video, and... You know, I asked somebody last night to go do it for me.
[00:35:36.555 --> 00:35:37.696]  Oh, my camera's broken.
[00:35:37.996 --> 00:35:38.636]  Which I understand.
[00:35:38.796 --> 00:35:39.217]  You know what?
[00:35:39.377 --> 00:35:40.177]  It's just fine.
[00:35:40.197 --> 00:35:41.838]  I don't even want to be around it.
[00:35:41.858 --> 00:35:46.461]  It would have made for great video to wake folks up, but I can't do it all anymore.
[00:35:46.901 --> 00:35:50.204]  And I'm going to do as much as I can, but...
[00:35:52.493 --> 00:35:58.055]  I need more support so I can get more people that work for me because we're all tied down.
[00:35:58.095 --> 00:35:58.895]  We're all working.
[00:36:00.835 --> 00:36:02.856]  Well, my normal employees work about 12 hours a day.
[00:36:02.956 --> 00:36:04.676]  I work really 18 hours a day.
[00:36:04.696 --> 00:36:06.137]  It's out of control.
[00:36:06.157 --> 00:36:09.197]  A few months ago, I was only working 12 hours a day or so.
[00:36:09.337 --> 00:36:11.238]  It slowed down a little bit, but I've sped back up.
[00:36:12.051 --> 00:36:15.093]  You know, I get very frustrated, very angry at myself.
[00:36:15.213 --> 00:36:16.093]  I can't do it all.
[00:36:16.554 --> 00:36:18.075]  Then I kind of spin out of control.
[00:36:18.115 --> 00:36:24.479]  You've heard me do that on air where I just start ranting and reading real fast and covering a bunch of stuff because it's like...
[00:36:28.919 --> 00:36:30.580]  It's like that game Missile Command.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:37.002]  Remember that old 70s video game where the missiles are coming at your bases, at your cities, and you're trying to block them all and shoot them all down?
[00:36:37.242 --> 00:36:49.746]  I feel like I'm in the highest levels of Missile Command, and the missiles are coming so fast, you can't stop them all, and you're in the zone trying to cover it all, trying to be able just to mention it all.
[00:36:50.226 --> 00:37:00.650]  But at the same time, if you don't detail each article, if you don't give people news behind the news of each article, then it doesn't make any sense to people and doesn't have any effect and doesn't shift paradigms.
[00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.810]  So you know what?
[00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:03.511]  I'm not going to feel bad anymore.
[00:37:03.791 --> 00:37:05.071]  I'm going to cover what I can cover.
[00:37:05.431 --> 00:37:06.692]  I'm going to do what I can do.
[00:37:06.792 --> 00:37:07.312]  And that's it.
[00:37:08.272 --> 00:37:10.573]  It's up to you to be leaders and do what you can do.
[00:37:10.633 --> 00:37:15.255]  But before I get to this article that I wrote this morning with a bunch of links...
[00:37:17.512 --> 00:37:19.373]  And I'll tell you what the mind control was and is.
[00:37:19.814 --> 00:37:22.556]  Going on in your area right now, guaranteed, and it'll be totally identical.
[00:37:24.377 --> 00:37:25.618]  You know, and it's a mode of operation.
[00:37:25.678 --> 00:37:26.478]  You might want to fight it.
[00:37:26.518 --> 00:37:28.600]  I mean, you should be so angry about this when you hear about it.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:29.440]  I know I am.
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:34.023]  I mean, I physically get red in the face when I've seen these newscasts and listened to it on the radio.
[00:37:34.424 --> 00:37:38.386]  The smirking, you know, the script they're reading off of.
[00:37:39.067 --> 00:37:40.768]  It makes me mad, folks, because they're hurting people.
[00:37:42.717 --> 00:38:00.386]  But before I get into that, if you do want to support us, if you do want us to be able to do more and cover more and post more videos and audio and do an even better job and make better films and get more done, we'll even have roving reporters so I don't have to always go places.
[00:38:01.186 --> 00:38:07.289]  And so I don't always have to basically beat myself up against a brick wall to do everything.
[00:38:07.769 --> 00:38:10.571]  But literally not sleep sometimes for two days.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:13.021]  But, you know, it gets the job done.
[00:38:13.661 --> 00:38:22.185]  So I can work smarter, and have more time to promote the films, which then reach people and have a bigger effect.
[00:38:22.745 --> 00:38:38.273]  Please get Martial Law, get Road to Tyranny, get Matrix of Evil, get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, get other videos I carry, like Innocence Betrayed by the JPFO, Jews of Preservation of Firearms Ownership, their incredible video, Exposing Gun Control,
[00:38:40.576 --> 00:38:42.897]  It comes with three free booklets when you get a copy.
[00:38:43.678 --> 00:38:56.384]  Get the new film that's out that's excellent, Beyond Treason, that we carry, that covers chemical and biological testing on our troops, killing them by design by our government.
[00:38:56.704 --> 00:39:05.048]  Get all the books and videos we carry because they're powerful, they wake people up, they're informative, but also because it supports what we're doing.
[00:39:06.488 --> 00:39:08.129]  Not just the GCN Radio Network.
[00:39:08.509 --> 00:39:10.930]  Alex Jones, that's me, Bob Dole.
[00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.331]  Bob Dole, talking about myself in third person.
[00:39:16.312 --> 00:39:17.232]  We need your support.
[00:39:17.272 --> 00:39:19.493]  The GCN Radio Network needs it, but also...
[00:39:21.198 --> 00:39:22.938]  I need it so we can do more, folks.
[00:39:23.318 --> 00:39:24.859]  There's so much more we could do.
[00:39:25.099 --> 00:39:26.479]  Really powerful stuff.
[00:39:26.519 --> 00:39:29.140]  But we need you to capitalize us and support us.
[00:39:29.460 --> 00:39:30.880]  So I'm not going to belabor this much more.

[00:40:36.497 --> 00:40:37.638]  Expenses are just too great.
[00:40:37.658 --> 00:40:39.860]  You know, three webmasters...
[00:40:41.221 --> 00:40:45.227]  And another part-time webmaster, and then the four servers and all of it.
[00:40:46.048 --> 00:40:47.971]  Again, I'm not trying to be the dead horse here, folks.
[00:40:48.091 --> 00:40:49.553]  It's just, it's important.
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:56.401]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001, that's 3001, South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:40:56.441 --> 00:40:57.962]  It's up to you, folks.
[00:40:58.062 --> 00:40:59.302]  The ball's in your court.
[00:41:17.921 --> 00:41:20.541]  You know, we fight harder and work harder than anybody else out there.
[00:41:21.082 --> 00:41:21.862]  That's on the record.
[00:41:22.762 --> 00:41:23.842]  And we need your support.
[00:41:24.502 --> 00:41:25.882]  And these videos are waking people up.
[00:41:25.942 --> 00:41:26.943]  Get them and make copies.
[00:41:27.623 --> 00:41:28.603]  Okay, I'm going to shut up.
[00:41:29.023 --> 00:41:32.463]  Here's the article, and then I'm going to go to your calls, and then the monetic clip.
[00:41:33.164 --> 00:41:34.484]  Out of the old memory hole.
[00:41:36.644 --> 00:41:42.745]  Schools lie to parents and children, say vaccinations are mandatory.
[00:41:43.785 --> 00:41:45.306]  Immunizations are mandatory.
[00:41:46.426 --> 00:41:47.326]  All over the country,
[00:41:48.124 --> 00:41:50.405]  Every year, it's the same.
[00:41:50.925 --> 00:42:04.170]  Take your vaccines, the list of which they claim is mandatory, now reaching 39 different injections, some of them combo shots.
[00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:07.351]  This is all a lie.
[00:42:07.491 --> 00:42:13.113]  There has never been a law that you have to be vaccinated to go to public schools.
[00:42:14.187 --> 00:42:20.552]  They have policies that have been deceptively written up by the federal government masquerading as law.
[00:42:21.132 --> 00:42:22.373]  They are color of law.
[00:42:22.513 --> 00:42:23.674]  They are frauds.
[00:42:25.115 --> 00:42:26.356]  I wrote this in about four minutes.
[00:42:27.157 --> 00:42:29.138]  I hope my webmaster read it for typos.
[00:42:29.158 --> 00:42:31.160]  That's how busy I am.
[00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:32.541]  I wish I could write real articles.
[00:42:32.901 --> 00:42:34.602]  I wrote this in like three or four minutes, folks.
[00:42:34.642 --> 00:42:35.283]  It's a lot longer.
[00:42:36.243 --> 00:42:42.508]  For the last three years, the country... It's a typo right there.
[00:42:43.783 --> 00:42:45.343]  Marks mid-summer.
[00:42:45.363 --> 00:42:46.724]  See why I'm frustrated?
[00:42:47.544 --> 00:42:51.705]  I'm letting you into my mind right now, folks, why I get so angry.
[00:42:53.245 --> 00:43:00.187]  For the last three years, the country marks mid-summer by the start of an ominous drumbeat.
[00:43:01.807 --> 00:43:02.867]  It's on the radio.
[00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:05.448]  It covers the front pages of the newspapers.
[00:43:07.148 --> 00:43:10.412]  Announcements festoon public parks and swimming pools.
[00:43:11.012 --> 00:43:23.486]  In Austin, Texas alone, there are dozens of television reports telling you of free vaccination clinics in public parks and gymnasiums warning you that your children must be vaccinated or you could be arrested.
[00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:28.857]  Five years ago, the public was not subjected to this propaganda bombardment.
[00:43:29.197 --> 00:43:29.577]  Why?
[00:43:30.177 --> 00:43:35.460]  Because five years ago, 95% of the country was vaccinating their children.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:40.302]  Today, the number has fallen to 65%, and the bottom is nowhere in sight.
[00:43:40.642 --> 00:43:41.702]  People are waking up.
[00:43:42.043 --> 00:43:49.786]  People have gotten wise to the fact that vaccines are contaminated with DNA fragments, viruses, fungus, mercury,
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:53.242]  And a cocktail of other poisonous toxins.
[00:43:53.802 --> 00:44:03.248]  Fleets of reputable studies have been published globally detailing the wide swath of destruction caused by vaccines.
[00:44:03.888 --> 00:44:06.150]  So now the establishment is on the offensive.
[00:44:06.630 --> 00:44:11.453]  Big Pharma is one of the big businesses.
[00:44:11.713 --> 00:44:16.356]  Again, Big Pharma is one of the biggest businesses in the world.
[00:44:17.076 --> 00:44:17.917]  Typo number two.
[00:44:19.344 --> 00:44:22.807]  I literally was writing this while I was eating breakfast real fast.
[00:44:23.488 --> 00:44:32.035]  It is among the top three purchasers of advertisement in print, TV, and radio, and has a major pull.
[00:44:33.797 --> 00:44:35.839]  You do not have to vaccinate your children.
[00:44:35.859 --> 00:44:38.041]  You do not have to get the affidavit.
[00:44:40.082 --> 00:44:45.147]  The schools have been trained via color of law that they have to have it.
[00:44:45.822 --> 00:45:02.918]  In the 2003 legislative session in Texas, we were forced to get a law passed stating that it is illegal for health departments to claim that it is the law that you must have a vaccination in order to attend school.
[00:45:03.679 --> 00:45:06.141]  All over the country, the propaganda is identical.
[00:45:06.701 --> 00:45:07.402]  Here in Austin...
[00:45:12.068 --> 00:45:16.251]  They've even run newscasts saying mercury is good for children.
[00:45:18.013 --> 00:45:20.595]  And in case you don't believe me, go ahead and roll that now.
[00:45:21.035 --> 00:45:22.516]  Here it is, folks, from last year.
[00:45:23.937 --> 00:45:26.379]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[00:45:26.619 --> 00:45:29.962]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[00:45:30.242 --> 00:45:35.046]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses, a new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[00:45:35.066 --> 00:45:38.589]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporters from the Mappers.
[00:45:41.107 --> 00:45:47.049]  Mercury-containing vaccines may help not harm kids, according to two new studies in the journal Pediatrics.
[00:45:47.550 --> 00:45:53.992]  There have been widespread concerns that mercury-based preservatives in vaccines might impair the neurological development of children.
[00:45:54.452 --> 00:46:01.375]  These new studies suggest that the opposite, that the preservatives may actually be associated with improved behavior and mental performance.
[00:46:03.050 --> 00:46:03.851]  And it goes on.
[00:46:04.191 --> 00:46:06.553]  So all over the country, the propaganda is identical.
[00:46:06.854 --> 00:46:11.398]  Here in Austin, they've run a newscast saying mercury is good for children.
[00:46:11.858 --> 00:46:16.103]  There seems to be no end to the brazen fabrications we are subjected to.
[00:46:18.965 --> 00:46:26.713]  It's time to get angry, spread the word, and demand retractions from your local media.
[00:46:27.193 --> 00:46:28.014]  Bottom line...
[00:46:29.984 --> 00:46:34.468]  It is illegal to tell someone that they are breaking the law when they are not.
[00:46:37.631 --> 00:46:42.816]  Bottom line, it is illegal to tell someone that they are breaking the law when it's not.
[00:46:43.496 --> 00:46:43.897]  Illegal.
[00:46:44.597 --> 00:46:46.379]  It's called coercion.
[00:46:47.079 --> 00:46:48.661]  It's called official oppression.
[00:46:49.101 --> 00:46:50.502]  It's called racketeering.
[00:46:50.863 --> 00:46:52.124]  It's called tyranny.
[00:46:54.836 --> 00:47:01.722]  And what made me so mad, I heard it on the radio this morning on KUT, the big public radio propaganda neocon channel.
[00:47:01.742 --> 00:47:04.105]  It was on local TV last night.
[00:47:04.485 --> 00:47:07.548]  Hey, get your face painted up like a clown for free!
[00:47:08.048 --> 00:47:08.969]  But it's the law!
[00:47:09.009 --> 00:47:10.350]  You've got to go get your shots!
[00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:11.071]  No school!
[00:47:11.111 --> 00:47:12.012]  You could get in trouble!
[00:47:12.617 --> 00:47:14.278]  Go to Zilker Park this morning.
[00:47:14.378 --> 00:47:15.539]  It's so fun.
[00:47:15.939 --> 00:47:17.321]  Get your shots and all.
[00:47:17.421 --> 00:47:21.343]  And they'll have gymnasiums set up like they did last year, days before school.
[00:47:21.363 --> 00:47:21.944]  You've got to go.
[00:47:21.984 --> 00:47:22.704]  You'll be arrested.
[00:47:23.065 --> 00:47:24.165]  Your parents will go to jail.
[00:47:24.206 --> 00:47:25.126]  You've got to have shots.
[00:47:25.446 --> 00:47:26.367]  And there's no law.
[00:47:26.707 --> 00:47:28.248]  You don't have to have the waiver, folks.
[00:47:28.889 --> 00:47:34.813]  Two years ago, we had to get a law passed, as we said in the article, in that abomination of an article.
[00:47:35.234 --> 00:47:39.857]  Why do I even write an article in three, four minutes and then post it when it's got all that in it?
[00:47:40.598 --> 00:47:41.259]  Do me a favor.
[00:47:41.379 --> 00:47:44.702]  Call my office and tell them to go in and fix all the typos.
[00:47:45.382 --> 00:47:45.783]  Please.
[00:47:47.004 --> 00:47:47.444]  Please.
[00:47:47.864 --> 00:47:48.245]  Please.
[00:47:48.265 --> 00:47:50.147]  Do me a favor, Stephanie, right now.
[00:47:50.867 --> 00:47:59.155]  Call my office, home office, five times if need be, until somebody gets on the line and tell them this thing looks like it was written by somebody who had a lobotomy.
[00:48:00.296 --> 00:48:00.636]  Thank you.
[00:48:00.996 --> 00:48:07.502]  And again, that's because I've got to leave to get to the studio, and I literally hammered it out and just left.
[00:48:08.527 --> 00:48:11.228]  And then again, it gets back to what I was talking about with frustration.
[00:48:13.889 --> 00:48:26.972]  But under it, we have all the links to the state law, the links to KVUE, fear-mongering, saying it's the law, to stories around the country where they're fear-mongering, just to show it's a national, international thing they're doing.
[00:48:27.772 --> 00:48:29.453]  We have all that evidence there.
[00:48:32.410 --> 00:48:35.753]  And I told my webmasters, too, to add the... We have the video.
[00:48:35.853 --> 00:48:37.194]  Obviously, you can't see it on radio.
[00:48:37.534 --> 00:48:39.356]  We have the video clip, too, on the website.
[00:48:40.757 --> 00:48:48.903]  Just type into a search engine, prisonplanet.com, Mercury's good for you, and you should get the page with the video clip right there.
[00:48:49.443 --> 00:48:52.586]  You won't actually see it, but it's in the article.
[00:48:54.167 --> 00:48:57.650]  So, you know, I mean, it's not true.
[00:48:58.564 --> 00:49:04.948]  It's not the law, but they get on TV, because Big Pharma is the biggest sponsor and basically is paying for all of this.
[00:49:04.988 --> 00:49:06.068]  It's a propaganda placement.
[00:49:06.568 --> 00:49:11.951]  All over the country, the same script, the same order, the same lies, and they tell everybody it's the law and you've got to do it.
[00:49:13.652 --> 00:49:15.093]  And that makes me angry, folks.
[00:49:16.394 --> 00:49:17.915]  It makes me very, very upset.
[00:49:19.275 --> 00:49:25.519]  And they lie about the fact, they tell you they've taken mercury out of the vaccines.
[00:49:25.599 --> 00:49:27.880]  That is a lie.
[00:49:29.016 --> 00:49:32.039]  They have actually increased it many times.
[00:49:32.879 --> 00:49:38.504]  Whereas before, one shot was over the level, but just over the level of safe murder.
[00:49:38.524 --> 00:49:40.266]  You took a whole bunch, it detoxified you.
[00:49:40.806 --> 00:49:54.498]  Now, even the Associated Press, because sometimes they do report the truth, reported last year that no, contrary to popular belief, for some reason it's been increased in the flu shots and others, MMR, measles, mumps, rubella, to 250 times safe level.
[00:49:54.558 --> 00:49:56.640]  So they've radically increased it.
[00:49:58.439 --> 00:50:01.140]  And the CDC documents were declassified two years ago.
[00:50:01.221 --> 00:50:05.043]  That is, Dan Burton's committee forcibly had them released under congressional order.
[00:50:05.763 --> 00:50:08.464]  They should have been classified to begin with, you know, vaccine patterns.
[00:50:09.285 --> 00:50:17.869]  And it was the CBC top guy scientist meeting in a big meeting, the big boardroom going, it's deadly, we've brain damaged millions, we've got to cover it up, but I'm not giving it to my grandchildren.
[00:50:18.169 --> 00:50:20.170]  I'm telling my son, don't give it to my granddaughters.
[00:50:21.111 --> 00:50:22.192]  That's a quote, by the way.
[00:50:22.572 --> 00:50:24.833]  I'm not giving it to my grandchildren and my children.
[00:50:25.773 --> 00:50:26.854]  I'm telling them, don't take it.
[00:50:27.435 --> 00:50:28.535]  We've got to cover this up.
[00:50:29.816 --> 00:50:31.556]  But again, they've got their bosses above them.
[00:50:31.656 --> 00:50:33.316]  They don't know why the vaccine companies do this.
[00:50:33.557 --> 00:50:34.877]  They do it to hurt you.
[00:50:34.897 --> 00:50:39.938]  You know, Aldous Huxley said Brave New World was what he'd been told they were going to do.
[00:50:40.318 --> 00:50:46.060]  And in that, they would brain damage the children at birth or even in the womb to make them stupid.
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.721]  People aren't as smart as they used to be, folks.
[00:50:50.361 --> 00:50:52.561]  It's not just that we're not getting as good an education.
[00:50:53.001 --> 00:50:55.522]  We're being dumbed down by design.
[00:50:56.368 --> 00:50:59.529]  I'm sorry if you can't handle the truth, folks, but I can handle it.
[00:50:59.669 --> 00:51:00.269]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:05.710]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.950 --> 00:51:07.530]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.870 --> 00:51:12.571]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.871 --> 00:51:17.332]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.732 --> 00:51:21.933]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.133 --> 00:51:22.773]  The constitutional
[00:51:22.813 --> 00:51:26.796]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:26.816 --> 00:51:28.718]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:01.918 --> 00:52:05.801]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:52:06.041 --> 00:52:11.486]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:11.746 --> 00:52:22.134]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:22.294 --> 00:52:26.618]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.798 --> 00:52:35.164]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:35.444 --> 00:52:41.749]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:41.909 --> 00:52:43.932]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:53:01.858 --> 00:53:05.940]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[00:53:24.366 --> 00:53:25.427]  We're good to go.
[00:53:44.790 --> 00:53:46.091]  Or call 888-216-2461.
[00:53:46.111 --> 00:53:46.311]  That's 888-216-2461.
[00:54:15.129 --> 00:54:16.349]  All right, we'll get to your calls.
[00:54:16.489 --> 00:54:18.970]  It's just there's been so much to cover.
[00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:36.394]  Coming up, I'll play that Norman Mineta comment about Chaney and the stand-down, the video that malfunctioned at C-SPAN, and they said they didn't have a way to get it when they knew they had 100-plus different outlets they could have bought their own video back from, sold in their archives, or put in their archives.
[00:54:38.014 --> 00:54:38.534]  We'll get to that.
[00:54:38.654 --> 00:54:39.574]  There's just so much.
[00:54:39.714 --> 00:54:42.035]  But we've got a guest come up in about 40 minutes.
[00:54:43.601 --> 00:54:44.421]  Very important guest.
[00:54:44.441 --> 00:54:47.722]  But right now, let's... Let me just say this.
[00:54:47.842 --> 00:54:57.565]  I mean, are you going to put up with the newscast, whether you live in Kentucky or Tennessee or Texas or Alabama or California, all over the country, just do a Google search.
[00:54:57.625 --> 00:54:58.325]  It's the same thing.
[00:54:58.405 --> 00:54:59.045]  It's the law.
[00:54:59.265 --> 00:54:59.905]  No school.
[00:55:00.886 --> 00:55:01.966]  No shots, no school.
[00:55:02.046 --> 00:55:02.726]  Don't take shots.
[00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:03.446]  Go to jail.
[00:55:03.546 --> 00:55:04.387]  Articles will pop up.
[00:55:04.847 --> 00:55:05.807]  It's a fraud.
[00:55:05.847 --> 00:55:07.087]  It's not true.
[00:55:07.467 --> 00:55:08.528]  It's color of law.
[00:55:08.748 --> 00:55:12.849]  This government's so corrupt, folks, that even when it's not the law, they say it's the law.
[00:55:13.675 --> 00:55:15.836]  It's like these checkpoints and searching your vehicle.
[00:55:15.856 --> 00:55:17.057]  They go, well, we're allowed to do this.
[00:55:17.397 --> 00:55:17.957]  No, you're not.
[00:55:18.137 --> 00:55:19.858]  You're not allowed to search people on the buses.
[00:55:20.058 --> 00:55:21.559]  You're not allowed to search all the bags.
[00:55:21.759 --> 00:55:23.941]  You're just training us that we don't have these rights.
[00:55:26.322 --> 00:55:33.986]  While we've got bedlam and literal anarchy on the southern border, there's nothing to be done about that.
[00:55:35.231 --> 00:55:37.773]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Regina in Pennsylvania.
[00:55:37.793 --> 00:55:38.573]  Regina, go ahead.
[00:55:38.873 --> 00:55:39.414]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:39.534 --> 00:55:42.656]  I see points up for your shirt.
[00:55:42.796 --> 00:55:47.099]  Politicians love to disarm peasants, and I'm going to tie that in.
[00:55:47.119 --> 00:55:49.120]  I hope you're still selling that shirt.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.341]  Yeah, we still have that shirt.
[00:55:51.182 --> 00:55:56.745]  This thing with the Kodak's language being part of the CAFTA, that's another disarming.
[00:55:56.785 --> 00:56:00.728]  And I understand from listening to C-SPAN this morning, this may be upped up.
[00:56:01.503 --> 00:56:03.047]  The vote may be even today.
[00:56:03.067 --> 00:56:06.095]  So please, I'm begging people, call that thing you were saying.
[00:56:06.115 --> 00:56:08.781]  Well, you know, I'm not just against CAFTA because of Codex.
[00:56:09.329 --> 00:56:14.131]  I understand that, but I have... The whole thing is Agenda 21, open Pan-American Union.
[00:56:14.151 --> 00:56:15.232]  The whole thing is bad.
[00:56:15.612 --> 00:56:22.375]  I'm not either, Alex, but there's a faction... I know, but if you call up into Washington and argue with them, they'll just say it's not in there, even if you give them the subsection.
[00:56:22.675 --> 00:56:25.077]  It's bad because it merges our police and military.
[00:56:25.377 --> 00:56:26.837]  It merges our Social Security.
[00:56:27.078 --> 00:56:28.358]  It merges our databases.
[00:56:28.598 --> 00:56:29.759]  It merges our laws.
[00:56:30.019 --> 00:56:31.600]  It merges our ID cards.
[00:56:31.880 --> 00:56:33.901]  It's bad news for jobs.
[00:56:34.662 --> 00:56:40.944]  Yeah, but see, you know, you have to realize that they're being threatened down there, that they won't get their highway funding or their bridge money.
[00:56:41.144 --> 00:56:43.085]  Yeah, Ron Paul's office talked about that Friday.
[00:56:43.325 --> 00:56:43.525]  Right.
[00:56:43.785 --> 00:56:47.867]  So, you know, the whole thing is, Alex, the section is in there.
[00:56:47.947 --> 00:56:51.488]  Section 6 of... Well, I didn't say the section wasn't there.
[00:56:51.548 --> 00:56:51.888]  Okay.
[00:56:52.408 --> 00:56:53.089]  I agree with you.
[00:56:53.249 --> 00:56:55.390]  But, you know, I'm feeling the same thing you are.
[00:56:55.930 --> 00:56:59.211]  When you stand up and you speak and you talk to people...
[00:56:59.707 --> 00:57:03.408]  They'll find every excuse not to call or not to understand what you're saying.
[00:57:03.448 --> 00:57:05.349]  So I think we really need to be praying for one another.
[00:57:05.369 --> 00:57:06.389]  Well, it's simple, America.
[00:57:06.489 --> 00:57:13.571]  Everything you eat and do and the jobs you have is all going to be regulated by private boards that our government signs treaties with.
[00:57:13.911 --> 00:57:19.893]  And you were talking about those Mexican towns down there where you're not allowed to speak anything but Mexican.
[00:57:19.913 --> 00:57:21.873]  You're not allowed to be white or black, okay?
[00:57:22.173 --> 00:57:22.713]  Okay.
[00:57:22.773 --> 00:57:24.794]  No, this is San Antonio Express News.
[00:57:25.655 --> 00:57:38.242]  Under CAFTA, it contains provisions that judges could tell citizens of Alabama, Oregon, Maine, or any state to change their laws, and the federal government, our tax dollars again, would be obligated to step in and force the state to do it.
[00:57:38.262 --> 00:57:40.624]  Yeah, it's treaty obligations, everything, yes.
[00:57:40.844 --> 00:57:45.927]  Right, and so there is a little opening down there on the China.
[00:57:45.987 --> 00:57:48.288]  They're having a battle over Phil English's bill.
[00:57:48.888 --> 00:57:51.950]  The AFL-CIO is against the Phil English bill.
[00:57:51.970 --> 00:57:53.131]  They said it doesn't do enough.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:58.742]  The pardon was on the floor saying that he wants a full dialogue on China.
[00:57:58.762 --> 00:57:59.402]  We need to call.
[00:57:59.422 --> 00:58:01.463]  When we call, vote down CAFTA.
[00:58:02.083 --> 00:58:05.304]  CAFTA grants the foreign investors greater legal rights in the U.S.
[00:58:05.324 --> 00:58:07.185]  than our own American companies.
[00:58:07.365 --> 00:58:08.145]  I hear you, Regina.
[00:58:08.385 --> 00:58:09.185]  Thank you for the call.
[00:58:09.265 --> 00:58:10.166]  Really appreciate it.
[00:58:11.026 --> 00:58:17.428]  Yeah, I mean, folks know what NAFTA and CAFTA and the free trade area of the Americas does.
[00:58:18.268 --> 00:58:19.769]  And people need to call Congress.
[00:58:22.071 --> 00:58:27.132]  And I'm not saying it doesn't work, but at the same time, everybody calls and says, we don't want Patriot Act.
[00:58:27.152 --> 00:58:27.492]  They do it.
[00:58:27.512 --> 00:58:31.953]  Everybody calls and says, you know, we don't want the national ID card.
[00:58:31.993 --> 00:58:32.433]  They do it.
[00:58:33.033 --> 00:58:37.874]  I mean, it's just, the dictatorship is forming right now, folks.
[00:58:38.194 --> 00:58:39.534]  I'm just not going to follow these laws.
[00:58:41.515 --> 00:58:46.176]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.899 --> 00:58:58.580]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.220 --> 00:59:00.281]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.002 --> 00:59:02.082]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.763 --> 00:59:03.604]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.324 --> 00:59:06.246]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.266 --> 00:59:09.589]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:14.232]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.252 --> 00:59:18.616]  All right, folks, into hour number two.
[00:59:19.437 --> 00:59:20.818]  We have a guest coming up.
[00:59:22.216 --> 00:59:23.477]  Several issues have come out.
[00:59:24.117 --> 00:59:29.660]  They now admit that atomic testing alone has caused 11,000 deaths in the United States.
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:32.341]  But the government tells you not to worry about it, so it's okay.
[00:59:32.701 --> 00:59:42.526]  Let's worry about 55 people that die in some train bombings and bus bombings, and then let's give up all of our freedoms and plush America down the toilet to be safe.
[00:59:44.026 --> 00:59:45.087]  As if that makes you safe.
[00:59:46.474 --> 00:59:50.236]  Meanwhile, it's come out, and I already knew this, but now even more documents have come to light.
[00:59:50.616 --> 00:59:56.679]  Hiroshima bomb may have been carried, hidden agenda to escalate and start the Cold War.
[00:59:57.399 --> 01:00:00.741]  And we have Dr. Peter Kuznick coming on in about 30 minutes.
[01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:01.681]  I know we have loaded phones.
[01:00:01.701 --> 01:00:02.602]  We're going to get to all of you.
[01:00:02.622 --> 01:00:05.563]  Wolfgang, Dana, Chris, Robert, Roger, and many others.
[01:00:07.044 --> 01:00:09.185]  And all over the country, they're announcing it's the law.
[01:00:09.205 --> 01:00:10.785]  You've got to show up and get your vaccines.
[01:00:11.146 --> 01:00:11.786]  Total lie.
[01:00:11.826 --> 01:00:12.566]  There is no law.
[01:00:12.806 --> 01:00:13.267]  They know it.
[01:00:13.287 --> 01:00:13.807]  They're criminals.
[01:00:15.082 --> 01:00:17.843]  And Mexican troops and others are slaughtering even more.
[01:00:17.903 --> 01:00:19.623]  We've got a travel advisory.
[01:00:19.643 --> 01:00:21.963]  One of the most dangerous regions in the world.
[01:00:22.083 --> 01:00:28.424]  I mean, that's even among South Africa and Iraq and places like that.
[01:00:28.904 --> 01:00:31.145]  Literally, folks, is the Texas-Mexico border.
[01:00:31.805 --> 01:00:33.605]  You never see it on the nightly news.
[01:00:33.685 --> 01:00:34.665]  It may be in Reuters.
[01:00:35.466 --> 01:00:36.866]  Never on the nightly news.
[01:00:38.466 --> 01:00:40.226]  I mean, hundreds dead.
[01:00:40.266 --> 01:00:41.807]  Hundreds of kidnapped American citizens.
[01:00:41.867 --> 01:00:42.427]  Dead U.S.
[01:00:42.467 --> 01:00:43.187]  cops everywhere.
[01:00:43.948 --> 01:00:44.168]  Hi, Alex.
[01:01:05.407 --> 01:01:07.228]  My camera's not broke at all.
[01:01:07.328 --> 01:01:14.611]  I got Chris Simcox from the Minuteman project on film last week when he was here in Kansas City.
[01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:15.211]  Good!
[01:01:15.431 --> 01:01:21.714]  And we're going to be showing that again tonight at 6000 Lamar here in Mission, Kansas.
[01:01:22.314 --> 01:01:29.757]  It's put on by the Concerned Citizens of Kansas City, and we want to see capacity room fill, that's for sure.
[01:01:30.350 --> 01:01:30.830]  All right.
[01:01:31.491 --> 01:01:34.572]  Our new website for our TV network is up and running.
[01:01:34.632 --> 01:01:36.533]  It's inyourface.tv.
[01:01:37.374 --> 01:01:43.037]  And we're issuing press passes to all the Minutemen people who want to go to the border this October.
[01:01:43.937 --> 01:01:48.019]  We expect 20,000 people to show up with cameras in hand.
[01:01:48.099 --> 01:01:49.040]  Well, actually, not 20,000.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.441]  Well, I'll tell you where the Minutemen need to come.
[01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:51.981]  All right.
[01:01:52.001 --> 01:01:53.342]  They need to come to Laredo.
[01:01:53.802 --> 01:01:54.703]  Laredo, Texas?
[01:01:55.083 --> 01:01:55.323]  Yes.
[01:01:55.911 --> 01:01:56.251]  All right.
[01:01:56.331 --> 01:02:02.795]  If you have a camcorder and you're listening, you can get your own press pass right there on inyourface.tv.
[01:02:03.135 --> 01:02:04.216]  And, you know, those are great.
[01:02:04.656 --> 01:02:09.038]  A press pass is just something the police see and then suddenly leave you alone.
[01:02:09.358 --> 01:02:09.578]  Right.
[01:02:09.659 --> 01:02:13.781]  I mean, in America, they shouldn't be messing with somebody with a camera to begin with, but they don't like it.
[01:02:14.081 --> 01:02:20.584]  They like putting cameras up our noses and having them, you know, in the bathrooms at rest stops when we're using the bathroom.
[01:02:20.985 --> 01:02:22.786]  But when we put a camera on them, they don't like it.
[01:02:22.806 --> 01:02:24.006]  You just go, hey, I'm press.
[01:02:24.286 --> 01:02:24.767]  That's right.
[01:02:24.887 --> 01:02:25.087]  Yeah.
[01:02:25.606 --> 01:02:27.127]  It gives you credibility.
[01:02:27.227 --> 01:02:29.929]  I'm plumbing your press automatically, but they're so dumbed down.
[01:02:30.169 --> 01:02:34.973]  They're so into signets and symbols and logos that it's like your badge.
[01:02:35.433 --> 01:02:41.778]  Right, and as far as that mercury goes, I had a big glass of mercury this morning with a cyanide chaser.
[01:02:41.798 --> 01:02:42.598]  Doesn't everybody?
[01:02:43.659 --> 01:02:45.480]  Well, you're with Al-Qaeda.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.442]  You don't believe it's good for you.
[01:02:47.782 --> 01:02:49.503]  Jim Jones said it was good in the Kool-Aid.
[01:02:49.543 --> 01:02:50.424]  He was a nice person.
[01:02:50.824 --> 01:02:51.064]  Right.
[01:02:51.465 --> 01:02:52.986]  Yeah, thanks for the call, Wolfgang.
[01:02:53.146 --> 01:02:54.086]  For those who don't know, the...
[01:02:56.087 --> 01:03:04.992]  It was all over the country last year, right before school this time, the federal government had a study going, actually, mercury-containing vaccines causes better behavior in children.
[01:03:05.572 --> 01:03:08.634]  And I guess the weird semantical twist is, yeah, it dumbs them down.
[01:03:08.674 --> 01:03:11.315]  They sit there in a docile fashion, drooling.
[01:03:12.155 --> 01:03:13.596]  And we played that clip last hour.
[01:03:14.336 --> 01:03:19.619]  And the same newscast running again all over the country, show up here, take your shot, it's the law.
[01:03:19.979 --> 01:03:21.740]  You could be arrested.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:24.922]  That'd be like if I got up and said...
[01:03:25.680 --> 01:03:28.522]  Show up down here and dig a ditch for me.
[01:03:28.582 --> 01:03:30.043]  You could be arrested if you don't.
[01:03:30.063 --> 01:03:35.286]  I mean, if I ran a TV ad, well, number one, they wouldn't take my ad saying that because they know it was illegal.
[01:03:35.306 --> 01:03:38.768]  It's extortion, color of law, racketeering, a fraud.
[01:03:39.488 --> 01:03:43.991]  But imagine if some private company ran an ad going, come down here and do this or you'll be arrested.
[01:03:44.051 --> 01:03:45.152]  The cops would go arrest them.
[01:03:45.852 --> 01:03:48.094]  But see, this is all, this is kosher, folks.
[01:03:48.134 --> 01:03:49.855]  This is supposed to be accepted.
[01:03:49.895 --> 01:03:50.295]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.388 --> 01:03:57.739]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:02.270]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:04.821 --> 01:04:06.884]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:04:06.964 --> 01:04:09.787]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:04:10.027 --> 01:04:14.253]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.313 --> 01:04:21.261]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.381 --> 01:04:23.404]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.624 --> 01:04:34.209]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.369 --> 01:04:39.751]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:04:40.252 --> 01:04:42.913]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[01:04:44.633 --> 01:04:46.434]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:53.149 --> 01:04:56.611]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:56.891 --> 01:05:00.372]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:00.472 --> 01:05:04.434]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:10.797]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.217 --> 01:05:19.121]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:19.521 --> 01:05:24.885]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:05:25.045 --> 01:05:28.808]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:29.169 --> 01:05:31.050]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:33.272]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:05:33.492 --> 01:05:38.436]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:44.040]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:47.182 --> 01:05:48.703]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:05:48.763 --> 01:05:51.264]  Protect your family.
[01:05:52.245 --> 01:05:54.606]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:05:54.847 --> 01:05:58.689]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:05:59.009 --> 01:05:59.830]  Read the labels.
[01:06:00.250 --> 01:06:04.392]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:04.612 --> 01:06:08.795]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:09.175 --> 01:06:14.038]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:14.418 --> 01:06:18.021]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:18.181 --> 01:06:23.545]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:06:23.805 --> 01:06:26.547]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:06:26.847 --> 01:06:27.728]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:06:28.048 --> 01:06:38.776]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:06:44.198 --> 01:06:49.061]  That's 800-340-7091, or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[01:06:53.182 --> 01:07:00.926]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:06.288 --> 01:07:07.189]  Oh, by the way!
[01:07:08.604 --> 01:07:17.326]  It is true, for much of yesterday, Japan couldn't get on the internet, Taiwan couldn't get on the internet, India couldn't get on the internet.
[01:07:18.827 --> 01:07:24.148]  A large portion of the internet was just magically down yesterday, and there really hasn't even been any news.
[01:07:24.288 --> 01:07:24.729]  Why?
[01:07:25.689 --> 01:07:32.191]  A lot of our listeners are finding the web hard to get onto, hard to log onto, even if you have good cable connections.
[01:07:32.631 --> 01:07:37.152]  They are not updating the DNS servers, they are not updating the router servers that the government...
[01:07:38.002 --> 01:07:52.637]  Predominantly of the United States controls, and they're saying they're going to let those die and then force you over onto Internet 2, which then has all these regulatory systems and taxation and free speech controls.
[01:07:54.058 --> 01:07:57.201]  They also have hate crimes they're trying to pass all over the world they have.
[01:07:57.621 --> 01:08:01.285]  America's about the last country where you can basically say anything without being arrested.
[01:08:02.261 --> 01:08:05.905]  You know, it starts out with, well, you shouldn't have neo-Nazis saying hateful things.
[01:08:06.025 --> 01:08:06.986]  No, they're bad.
[01:08:07.266 --> 01:08:08.467]  Let's take their free speech.
[01:08:08.527 --> 01:08:17.557]  And then you can't protest the homosexuals, or you can't protest the bulldozers about to knock down the Redwoods, or you can't protest Bush.
[01:08:18.277 --> 01:08:19.879]  It's all started, see?
[01:08:20.239 --> 01:08:24.904]  You take somebody else's free speech, even if you don't like them, you better defend them.
[01:08:27.350 --> 01:08:36.796]  Oh, but by the way, free speech doesn't mean my show belongs to stalkers and neocons and people I know that are putting out this info and trying to hurt people.
[01:08:38.538 --> 01:08:45.062]  Also, then on the other side of that, we've got people that say censorship means if I don't have them on this show.
[01:08:46.551 --> 01:08:57.258]  Or censorship means that I won't let them walk all over me, or that I won't let them slander and libel and defame people.
[01:08:58.251 --> 01:09:00.072]  So there's also that extreme over there.
[01:09:00.653 --> 01:09:01.654]  And the media will do that.
[01:09:01.694 --> 01:09:03.995]  They'll hold up examples of the most extreme thing.
[01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:14.123]  You know, someone in an art exhibit eating his own excrement, and then the New York Health Department, this happened about ten years ago, comes in and says, you're not allowed to have this art display, it's unhealthy.
[01:09:14.623 --> 01:09:17.406]  And they go, oh, how dare you try to take our rock?
[01:09:18.126 --> 01:09:19.147]  That's not art, folks.
[01:09:19.187 --> 01:09:24.371]  That is a public, that is obscene, that is dangerous, that should be illegal.
[01:09:25.592 --> 01:09:25.832]  Okay?
[01:09:27.617 --> 01:09:32.381]  But even though I find it to... And there's a borderline right there at that extremity.
[01:09:32.721 --> 01:09:45.710]  Even though I'm not a Catholic, but I find it very abhorrent and very obnoxious and very evil and very hateful to smear the Virgin Mary in Caldung, as they did in New York a few years ago.
[01:09:46.271 --> 01:09:47.432]  That was not shut down.
[01:09:48.152 --> 01:09:49.413]  And it made a lot of people mad.
[01:09:49.433 --> 01:09:50.774]  And the guy did it to get attention.
[01:09:51.875 --> 01:09:55.818]  And I think he shouldn't be given attention, but still, let that scumbag do what he's doing
[01:09:58.773 --> 01:09:59.795]  Let him do it to Jesus.
[01:10:00.435 --> 01:10:01.476]  A statue of Jesus.
[01:10:01.516 --> 01:10:07.764]  The point is, even though I find that horrible and blasphemous, still, let that demon do that.
[01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:12.309]  Again, they hold that up as a reason to restrict free speech, but...
[01:10:13.618 --> 01:10:16.660]  You've got to draw the line at people that want to cut their own arms and legs off.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:20.842]  You know, tattoos and body modification isn't enough now.
[01:10:21.082 --> 01:10:24.504]  Having horns added or vampire teeth added, that isn't enough now.
[01:10:24.544 --> 01:10:26.404]  Now people want to have their arms and legs cut off.
[01:10:26.685 --> 01:10:27.405]  Oh, that isn't enough.
[01:10:27.425 --> 01:10:28.445]  You're not really cool.
[01:10:28.626 --> 01:10:30.787]  Why, I had both legs and an arm cut off.
[01:10:31.087 --> 01:10:31.587]  Oh, really?
[01:10:31.867 --> 01:10:34.148]  I've had both my arms and both my legs cut off.
[01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:34.969]  Oh, it's quite popular.
[01:10:35.729 --> 01:10:38.050]  Hundreds of people I know of every year are getting it done.
[01:10:38.651 --> 01:10:39.651]  Some people die from it, too.
[01:10:39.671 --> 01:10:43.153]  They go down to Mexico to have their legs cut off, and they die of infection down there.
[01:10:43.706 --> 01:10:44.747]  That just happened a few months ago.
[01:10:44.767 --> 01:10:45.888]  Another case of it.
[01:10:46.589 --> 01:10:48.530]  You know, that should be illegal, folks.
[01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:49.531]  That's not expression.
[01:10:49.571 --> 01:10:50.272]  That's not free speech.
[01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:51.553]  That's mutilation.
[01:10:51.573 --> 01:10:52.373]  That's violence.
[01:10:52.634 --> 01:10:53.795]  That's mental illness.
[01:10:54.755 --> 01:10:57.598]  But notice they say your child being hyper is mental ill.
[01:10:57.838 --> 01:11:00.060]  We've got to put them on Prozac and Ritalin.
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:06.726]  But then someone chopping their legs off, this mentally ill American psychiatric system says, oh, that's good.
[01:11:07.426 --> 01:11:10.269]  Chopping your own limbs off is good.
[01:11:11.369 --> 01:11:14.892]  But having energy as a young mammal is bad.
[01:11:14.912 --> 01:11:17.173]  See, it's all tailored for death.
[01:11:17.193 --> 01:11:19.355]  Now, how did I get off into this?
[01:11:19.555 --> 01:11:19.915]  I don't know.
[01:11:19.935 --> 01:11:25.659]  The point is that there's a real move to regulate the web and regulate speech.
[01:11:27.421 --> 01:11:33.005]  And I don't want to regulate... I mean, I think Metro should be able to say white people are evil and they're going to make us leave America.
[01:11:33.965 --> 01:11:36.907]  I have my right to say they're racist.
[01:11:36.927 --> 01:11:37.588]  And that's wrong.
[01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:48.211]  Khalid Muhammad, before he died, had the right to say, you kill the white women, you kill the white children, because the white women are the military manufacturing centers!
[01:11:48.611 --> 01:11:49.651]  He's got a right to say that.
[01:11:51.052 --> 01:11:52.693]  David Duke's got a right to say what he says.
[01:11:52.713 --> 01:11:53.353]  I don't agree with it.
[01:11:54.533 --> 01:11:55.674]  They've got a right to say it.
[01:11:56.374 --> 01:11:59.776]  Because if they take their rights away, I lose mine.
[01:12:01.156 --> 01:12:01.376]  Alright.
[01:12:02.137 --> 01:12:02.697]  I'm ranting.
[01:12:02.817 --> 01:12:03.217]  It's true.
[01:12:03.517 --> 01:12:03.937]  I'll admit it.
[01:12:04.838 --> 01:12:08.139]  Let's talk to Dana in Seattle, Washington.
[01:12:09.502 --> 01:12:10.203]  Hello, Alex.
[01:12:10.283 --> 01:12:10.623]  Hi.
[01:12:10.663 --> 01:12:12.324]  How are you?
[01:12:12.344 --> 01:12:15.167]  Did you get my facts I sent you last week?
[01:12:15.487 --> 01:12:15.948]  Yes, I did.
[01:12:15.988 --> 01:12:17.709]  Thank you for that information.
[01:12:18.049 --> 01:12:19.110]  Well, you're welcome.
[01:12:19.230 --> 01:12:23.434]  I don't know if you've ever heard of the book called Acid Dreams.
[01:12:23.474 --> 01:12:23.995]  Yes, I have.
[01:12:24.275 --> 01:12:24.895]  Have you read it?
[01:12:25.516 --> 01:12:26.637]  No, I've read a synopsis.
[01:12:27.293 --> 01:12:31.234]  Okay, then you get the general jest of things that... Yeah, why don't you tell folks what you're talking about?
[01:12:31.615 --> 01:12:37.417]  Well, it's a book that was written based on the history of the CIA sitting at the drug culture across this country.
[01:12:37.737 --> 01:12:38.377]  It should matter.
[01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:41.678]  It turned out Timothy Leary was government operative the whole time.
[01:12:41.698 --> 01:12:43.419]  Gloria Steinem was CIA.
[01:12:43.799 --> 01:12:44.019]  Ms.
[01:12:44.059 --> 01:12:45.619]  Magazine was the CIA front.
[01:12:45.959 --> 01:12:46.320]  Go ahead.
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.241]  Well, they picked Leary up out of a psych hospital.
[01:12:50.856 --> 01:12:53.537]  In a VW Volkswagen bus.
[01:12:53.597 --> 01:12:56.098]  That's how the VW got into the peace movement.
[01:12:56.258 --> 01:12:57.598]  And they made him a star.
[01:12:57.978 --> 01:13:06.981]  Yeah, and they stopped at all of the big cities like Chicago and Detroit and went to the poor areas of town and got kids hooked on LSD and all kinds of stuff.
[01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:08.802]  And they tripped across the country.
[01:13:08.842 --> 01:13:09.302]  Yeah, I know.
[01:13:09.342 --> 01:13:11.883]  He had massive, just huge containers of it.
[01:13:12.543 --> 01:13:16.424]  And then when they got to San Francisco, that's how they established Kate Ashbury.
[01:13:16.909 --> 01:13:22.232]  But it also goes into the other covert activities against American citizens that the CIA did.
[01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:26.474]  Like dumping a virus on San Francisco where several people got killed.
[01:13:27.674 --> 01:13:29.335]  That was in 1949.
[01:13:30.896 --> 01:13:32.677]  No, this was in the 60s.
[01:13:32.797 --> 01:13:35.859]  But since then, I was about to say, there have been hundreds of other cases.
[01:13:36.539 --> 01:13:37.760]  In Washington, D.C.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.500]  at the White House.
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:40.761]  So you were talking about that the other day.
[01:13:41.261 --> 01:13:42.302]  For those that don't know...
[01:13:43.203 --> 01:13:46.707]  Let me get this through to the cops and everybody else listening that doesn't want to believe me.
[01:13:47.087 --> 01:13:47.628]  Listen to me.
[01:13:48.409 --> 01:13:49.570]  It's declassified.
[01:13:49.630 --> 01:13:50.210]  It's public.
[01:13:50.250 --> 01:13:51.332]  It's not debatable.
[01:13:51.892 --> 01:13:56.557]  Your government has nerve-gassed you, sprayed you, tested on you.
[01:13:57.718 --> 01:14:01.102]  What she's saying is this is all public knowledge, ancient history.
[01:14:01.402 --> 01:14:02.143]  This is admitted.
[01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:03.929]  Yeah, but they keep doing it.
[01:14:04.089 --> 01:14:05.430]  It may be ancient history.
[01:14:05.450 --> 01:14:06.871]  No, no, no, I wasn't poo-pooing.
[01:14:07.412 --> 01:14:09.793]  No, no, no, ma'am, you're not getting what I'm saying, Dana.
[01:14:10.114 --> 01:14:10.414]  I'm sorry.
[01:14:10.454 --> 01:14:13.896]  I'm saying what you're saying is established, admitted.
[01:14:14.317 --> 01:14:15.137]  Exactly.
[01:14:15.197 --> 01:14:16.338]  That's what I meant by ancient history.
[01:14:17.199 --> 01:14:18.019]  And they nuked us.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:26.666]  You know, us baby boomers, people between 40 and 65, are the ones sickest with cancers because we were the kids, the unborn babies, or the young adults.
[01:14:27.239 --> 01:14:30.020]  That we're exposed to all this nuclear crap across this country.
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:37.263]  And it has hundreds of times worse effect on fast-growing cells, hence embryonic or young children under the age of five.
[01:14:37.563 --> 01:14:38.084]  Exactly.
[01:14:38.204 --> 01:14:39.504]  It goes to our immune system.
[01:14:40.224 --> 01:14:49.108]  Well, a major federal report came out admitting at least 11,000, and that's the tip of the iceberg, people have died from the atomic testing.
[01:14:49.128 --> 01:14:54.730]  A whole lot more than that, especially if you bring in all the soldiers, if you bring in all the natives from Marshall Islands.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:00.781]  Alex, they have, they blew up, vaporized three islands over there.
[01:15:01.141 --> 01:15:02.401]  And you know how they fixed that?
[01:15:02.481 --> 01:15:06.982]  They just, new Pacific map, and went on and acted like nothing ever happened.
[01:15:07.402 --> 01:15:15.844]  They have one island over there that I talked to a local anthropologist about four years ago here, and she still goes over there periodically.
[01:15:16.805 --> 01:15:22.326]  They have one island that they keep bringing the islanders back to, and then they have to take them off again.
[01:15:22.955 --> 01:15:27.137]  And they have been trying to figure out how to get rid of all of that contaminated soil.
[01:15:27.257 --> 01:15:27.478]  I know.
[01:15:27.578 --> 01:15:28.298]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:28.838 --> 01:15:31.960]  They dropped hydrogen bombs on a bunch of islands out in the Pacific.
[01:15:33.661 --> 01:15:35.582]  And this stuff gets into the air.
[01:15:35.622 --> 01:15:37.223]  And then cancer rates explode.
[01:15:37.243 --> 01:15:39.184]  And then, oh, aspartame causes cancer.
[01:15:41.065 --> 01:15:46.108]  And I don't mean like it increases it a little bit like eating T-bone steaks five times a day, folks.
[01:15:46.808 --> 01:15:49.970]  I mean, you know, it's much worse than smoking five packs of six a day.
[01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:51.231]  I mean, it's deadly.
[01:15:52.848 --> 01:16:10.353]  And, you know, I heard some white trash scum yesterday when I called into a talk show call in later and basically talk about how I'm a liar putting out propaganda about how DU is bad for you.
[01:16:10.973 --> 01:16:12.394]  And how I'm a big liar.
[01:16:14.114 --> 01:16:17.035]  And, you know, I mean, I'm sick of people like you.
[01:16:17.475 --> 01:16:20.556]  And how I'm trying to undermine the troops!
[01:16:22.222 --> 01:16:26.705]  Did you know the troops have been re-upped and re-upped and re-upped and they lied to them on their contracts?
[01:16:26.965 --> 01:16:28.506]  Did you know it's been in the Associated Press?
[01:16:28.526 --> 01:16:32.829]  They'll discharge them in Rammstein and make them pay for their plane tickets back.
[01:16:33.149 --> 01:16:40.634]  And this guy goes, well, I got the wristband that was his radiation detector.
[01:16:42.176 --> 01:16:42.676]  Or no, that was...
[01:16:44.793 --> 01:16:45.594]  He clarified.
[01:16:46.194 --> 01:16:47.335]  He called into the show before.
[01:16:47.435 --> 01:16:48.335]  And I know who the guy is.
[01:16:48.375 --> 01:16:49.216]  He's always hated me.
[01:16:49.616 --> 01:16:51.097]  I guess because I'm good looking and he's not.
[01:16:51.817 --> 01:16:53.078]  That's really what it boils down to.
[01:16:53.098 --> 01:16:54.839]  I remember years ago seeing this guy.
[01:16:54.859 --> 01:16:56.000]  He was just looking at me with hatred.
[01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.100]  Little beady eyes.
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:58.301]  I'm sick of that guy.
[01:16:58.681 --> 01:16:59.662]  I'll expose him too.
[01:17:00.382 --> 01:17:05.325]  And he was... And then another scumbag called in as well.
[01:17:05.525 --> 01:17:07.666]  I'm just sick of those people.
[01:17:07.966 --> 01:17:10.188]  And I'm sitting there and...
[01:17:12.057 --> 01:17:25.500]  And just putting up with this, and I'm sitting there driving along listening to this guy yesterday, and he goes, yeah, I took his watch wristband and put a radiation detector on it, and it didn't show any radiation.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:28.260]  And, you know, he was in an Abrams tank.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:34.621]  Well, that's not what Dr. Doug Rocky and all these people say.
[01:17:34.641 --> 01:17:36.202]  That's not what the Army's own handbook.
[01:17:36.222 --> 01:17:37.282]  Do you understand, fool?
[01:17:38.174 --> 01:17:52.239]  That on the website, we shouldn't even know how to use, we have the links to the Army's own manuals on this that they won't issue to the troops, where it says that if you get anywhere near a tank or a building that's been hit by this, that it's deadly poisonous, just from the heavy metal levels.
[01:17:53.399 --> 01:17:54.560]  You think mercury's bad?
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:55.400]  This stuff's even worse.
[01:17:55.440 --> 01:17:56.660]  It just burns through your tissue.
[01:17:57.741 --> 01:18:04.163]  And at the same time, when it gets in your lungs, it has a cumulative radiological effect.
[01:18:06.204 --> 01:18:09.667]  And, you know, Dr. Doug Rocky, about half his team has died.
[01:18:09.687 --> 01:18:12.349]  You know, he is a patriot, folks.
[01:18:12.369 --> 01:18:17.032]  He went over and inspected and did the cleanup of those tanks on the highway of death and other areas.
[01:18:17.212 --> 01:18:18.173]  You know, he's dying.
[01:18:18.393 --> 01:18:24.537]  So don't you dare claim that he's not patriotic and that we're trying to undermine the troops when that guy's had so many.
[01:18:24.557 --> 01:18:26.098]  He just had three more surgeries.
[01:18:26.138 --> 01:18:26.759]  I talked to him.
[01:18:27.359 --> 01:18:32.243]  I talked to him last week, and he's been real sick, and he's going to try to come on next week.
[01:18:34.224 --> 01:18:36.046]  You know, I get angry at people like you.
[01:18:37.408 --> 01:18:38.189]  You know, I don't care.
[01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:39.450]  You know, I know you're mad at me.
[01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:43.355]  You know, I know you're mad at me because I'm straight and strong and you're not.
[01:18:43.375 --> 01:18:45.858]  Because you're scum and I'm not.
[01:18:46.699 --> 01:18:51.785]  But why don't you care about the truth a little bit more, you boot-licking, bush-worshipping, white-trash scum?
[01:18:54.093 --> 01:18:57.777]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:18:58.178 --> 01:19:03.604]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:19:04.065 --> 01:19:09.211]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:19:09.871 --> 01:19:23.177]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:19:23.678 --> 01:19:29.000]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:35.163]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:19:35.503 --> 01:19:35.563]  1-800-686-2237
[01:19:53.624 --> 01:19:55.225]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:19:55.385 --> 01:19:59.406]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:19:59.606 --> 01:20:02.487]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:02.567 --> 01:20:09.289]  The powerful black Berkey verification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:09.469 --> 01:20:12.490]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:20:12.690 --> 01:20:15.071]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:15.191 --> 01:20:23.093]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[01:20:23.393 --> 01:20:23.733]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:23.793 --> 01:20:25.354]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.

[01:21:28.244 --> 01:21:28.724]  We're good to go.
[01:21:28.744 --> 01:21:29.125]  We're good to go.
[01:21:53.402 --> 01:21:56.784]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:21:57.024 --> 01:21:57.344]  Why?
[01:21:57.364 --> 01:22:00.305]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:22:00.385 --> 01:22:05.328]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[01:22:39.706 --> 01:22:40.846]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[01:22:40.866 --> 01:22:42.427]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:23:06.443 --> 01:23:20.174]  You know, the federal government's own numbers, the Centers for Disease Control and others, I mean, it's been on the cover of Time Life, that since the first Gulf War, our troops have tripled the deformities.
[01:23:21.075 --> 01:23:22.676]  Not doubled, but tripled.
[01:23:23.712 --> 01:23:25.692]  Not a 20% increase, which would be huge.
[01:23:26.172 --> 01:23:27.233]  Not a 100% increase.
[01:23:27.433 --> 01:23:29.413]  A 300% increase.
[01:23:30.473 --> 01:23:48.717]  And man, to hear people out there just deny that, and to deny what the Army's own manuals say about depleted uranium, and to put some radiation detector, even if the guy's telling the truth, that picks up high levels of radiation...
[01:23:51.909 --> 01:23:54.109]  You can take a Geiger counter and send it out in the sun.
[01:23:54.129 --> 01:23:56.650]  It'll start going off because that is radiation.
[01:23:57.910 --> 01:24:00.931]  And then DU is something completely different, folks.
[01:24:02.751 --> 01:24:05.392]  Dr. Rocky, I've got him coming on next week if he's able to.
[01:24:05.472 --> 01:24:07.612]  Again, quite a few surgeries right now.
[01:24:07.692 --> 01:24:12.193]  Most of his team's dead, half of them, but it's so much fun over there and so good for you.
[01:24:12.913 --> 01:24:15.174]  And I don't know what to say to these people anymore.
[01:24:15.194 --> 01:24:16.814]  He can go over all the details of it.
[01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.520]  But I could sit there and give that person.
[01:24:20.060 --> 01:24:22.421]  I could sit there and give them the Army manual.
[01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:25.083]  Hey, shut up, scum!
[01:24:26.263 --> 01:24:33.307]  The only reason I said that comment about I'm good looking and they're not, you know, I never talk like that, is because I assess people.
[01:24:33.347 --> 01:24:34.567]  I'm pretty good at assessing people.
[01:24:35.288 --> 01:24:39.630]  And I remember, it just so happened I'd been around that person a few times at events, and just the hatred of them.
[01:24:40.583 --> 01:24:50.991]  You know, even back when I was what you'd call kind of a neocon eight, nine, ten years ago, you know, more of a George Bush supporter before I totally woke up, you know, back when he was governor.
[01:24:52.432 --> 01:24:55.715]  I guess I'd already woken up even before he was governor to a certain extent.
[01:24:55.755 --> 01:25:04.302]  But, you know, just how people can stick George Bush stickers all over their cars when a guy appoints attorney generals who are anti-gun.
[01:25:06.428 --> 01:25:16.132]  And then another individual who I've known for years, acts like they're one of my friends, and they call into a show and agree with the people that disagree with me about stuff.
[01:25:16.512 --> 01:25:17.132]  It's sick!
[01:25:18.513 --> 01:25:30.998]  You know, supporting the troops, supporting the troops, doesn't mean that you flush them down the toilet.
[01:25:31.979 --> 01:25:35.300]  Supporting the troops means you get up off your lazy hind end
[01:25:37.492 --> 01:25:55.380]  When you're not out doing the devil's work, and you get up off your lazy hind end, and you go and you read the government's own statistics about the deformities, and the health problems, and the illnesses, you need to understand something.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.960]  People like you have already lost.
[01:25:57.761 --> 01:26:00.642]  Because the New World Order has only got the weak people following them.
[01:26:01.403 --> 01:26:08.885]  They've got the weak people following them, they've got a lot of evil, some of them strong, parasites that empower them and run their system.
[01:26:09.526 --> 01:26:11.006]  But your system's going down.
[01:26:12.707 --> 01:26:15.007]  And I hope you understand that, and I hope you know that.
[01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:16.928]  You're going down.
[01:26:18.409 --> 01:26:19.229]  You're going to go down.
[01:26:19.269 --> 01:26:22.070]  We're going to defend the Second Amendment, whether you like it or not.
[01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:25.531]  And we're going to stop abortion, whether you like it or not.
[01:26:26.716 --> 01:26:34.082]  And we're going to do something about your neocon leader, George W. Bush, whether you like it or not, neocons.
[01:26:35.563 --> 01:26:36.544]  You may love a lie.
[01:26:36.584 --> 01:26:37.785]  You may love a deception.
[01:26:37.985 --> 01:26:39.006]  But we love the light.
[01:26:39.646 --> 01:26:41.608]  And the truth will shine through.
[01:26:41.628 --> 01:26:48.553]  I remember debating a UT professor who went on to be some Marine Corps officer.
[01:26:48.733 --> 01:26:49.194]  Yeah, weird.
[01:26:49.214 --> 01:26:50.995]  They become professors and then Marine Corps officers.
[01:26:51.015 --> 01:26:52.957]  I remember debating that slimebag.
[01:26:54.473 --> 01:27:04.160]  About seven years ago, about the fact that DU was bad and the fact that they had a Gulf War illness and that the vaccine was bad.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:08.464]  And of course later they admitted the vaccine was deadly and made everybody sick and the government now admits that.
[01:27:08.544 --> 01:27:09.064]  It's admitted.
[01:27:10.465 --> 01:27:10.986]  It's admitted.
[01:27:12.167 --> 01:27:13.348]  But it doesn't matter to these people.
[01:27:14.309 --> 01:27:18.532]  They'll defend the establishment to the end because they think they'll get power out of it.
[01:27:18.812 --> 01:27:21.054]  They think they're safe by joining the evil.
[01:27:21.354 --> 01:27:22.155]  And you're not safe.
[01:27:24.324 --> 01:27:25.244]  Alright, let's go ahead.
[01:27:25.544 --> 01:27:26.304]  It's based in Florida.
[01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:29.065]  They're afraid of the New World Order, so they lick its boots.
[01:27:30.665 --> 01:27:32.706]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Tennessee.
[01:27:32.746 --> 01:27:33.366]  Chris, go ahead.
[01:27:34.046 --> 01:27:34.446]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:34.466 --> 01:27:35.026]  How are you, buddy?
[01:27:35.266 --> 01:27:35.526]  Good.
[01:27:36.006 --> 01:27:38.447]  Hey, I'm a veteran myself.
[01:27:39.847 --> 01:27:41.928]  I've been in the military about 17 years, man.
[01:27:41.948 --> 01:27:43.368]  I'll tell you what.
[01:27:43.708 --> 01:27:45.608]  I quit drinking Kool-Aid a couple years ago.
[01:27:46.268 --> 01:27:54.070]  I'm on my way out, and I wanted to give you a heads up on an email that I forwarded to you concerning a quote that I got from a briefcase
[01:27:57.025 --> 01:27:57.365]  Stay there.
[01:27:57.385 --> 01:27:58.146]  Did you send me the email?
[01:27:58.166 --> 01:27:58.226]  Yes.
[01:27:58.726 --> 01:27:59.626]  Did I post it?
[01:28:22.307 --> 01:28:23.608]  Tips at Infowars.com.
[01:28:23.708 --> 01:28:24.468]  Did we post it?
[01:28:25.008 --> 01:28:31.211]  I just sent it this morning because I spoke with one of the ladies there in Austin, and she gave me direction on what to do concerning email.
[01:28:31.251 --> 01:28:31.431]  Well, good.
[01:28:31.451 --> 01:28:32.912]  I want to get that posted, but stay there.
[01:28:32.932 --> 01:28:34.793]  I want to hear this on the other side.
[01:28:34.813 --> 01:28:35.874]  We've also got a guest coming up.
[01:28:35.894 --> 01:28:39.736]  We'll get him on, but we'll have the guest hold while you finish up, Chris.
[01:28:40.076 --> 01:28:40.916]  We'll be right back, folks.
[01:28:40.936 --> 01:28:42.997]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.018 --> 01:28:44.978]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.418 --> 01:28:47.039]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.940 --> 01:28:50.621]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.803 --> 01:29:02.652]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[01:29:02.932 --> 01:29:05.295]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[01:29:05.535 --> 01:29:07.498]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[01:29:07.838 --> 01:29:13.185]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[01:29:13.565 --> 01:29:17.847]  The keychain-attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[01:29:18.287 --> 01:29:26.191]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[01:29:26.391 --> 01:29:31.434]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[01:29:31.454 --> 01:29:33.455]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[01:29:33.975 --> 01:29:37.136]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[01:29:37.356 --> 01:29:39.817]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[01:29:40.037 --> 01:29:41.417]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[01:29:41.617 --> 01:29:46.398]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[01:29:46.638 --> 01:29:48.979]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[01:29:49.079 --> 01:29:49.579]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[01:29:53.726 --> 01:29:54.326]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:54.426 --> 01:29:55.327]  Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.467 --> 01:29:59.589]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.709 --> 01:30:02.611]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.671 --> 01:30:09.394]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.574 --> 01:30:12.576]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.776 --> 01:30:15.177]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.297 --> 01:30:20.020]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:34.791]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Aptazine, Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:34.932 --> 01:30:41.617]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:30:44.999 --> 01:30:46.802]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:55.759 --> 01:30:56.139]  We're good to go.
[01:31:21.306 --> 01:31:22.508]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:22.668 --> 01:31:26.053]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:26.113 --> 01:31:27.234]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:27.515 --> 01:31:28.817]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:31:28.997 --> 01:31:35.846]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:35.946 --> 01:31:38.410]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:41.512]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.532 --> 01:31:41.572]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.592 --> 01:31:42.552]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:32:06.813 --> 01:32:10.836]  Alright, we are now at the halfway point in this worldwide broadcast.
[01:32:12.457 --> 01:32:23.944]  Coming up in just a minute or two, we're going to be talking to a very distinguished gentleman, Dr. Peter Kuznick, Director of the Nuclear Studies Institute at American University in Washington, D.C.
[01:32:24.905 --> 01:32:29.928]  And the headline, a new scientist, Hiroshima bomb may have carried hidden agenda.
[01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:50.494]  Another big story out of New Scientist last Friday, and these are all on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com right now, was the federal government coming out at several major agencies and releasing studies going, yes, at least 11,000 Americans died and tens of thousands worldwide.
[01:32:51.673 --> 01:33:01.119]  More just from our atomic test and the increase in radiation and the absorption of that, particularly in the southwest where many of these tests above ground were done.
[01:33:01.459 --> 01:33:06.423]  So we'll go to the doctor here in just a moment with these incredible revelations on top of all the other revelations.
[01:33:07.023 --> 01:33:12.927]  But Chris in Tennessee, and we're going to be posting his email on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:33:13.827 --> 01:33:16.929]  You didn't finish your statement, but I'm going to guess what the colonel said.
[01:33:18.931 --> 01:33:26.315]  Because I know what I saw on C-SPAN last year with Thomas Barnett, Naval War College, with all these generals in attendance, a huge amphitheater full of them.
[01:33:26.696 --> 01:33:38.042]  They said, we fight for global government, we fight for Wall Street, we fight to keep the stock up, we work for international corporations, and we're going to invade the world and take over all the resources.
[01:33:38.082 --> 01:33:44.846]  So it's not really a secret, but let me, I mean, what did your colonel tell you you were fighting for?
[01:33:46.015 --> 01:33:50.939]  Actually, Alex, he's a chaplain for this unit here in Tennessee, the 278th.
[01:33:51.599 --> 01:34:00.426]  And he gave instructions during this briefing that if anyone was to ask you why we are in Iraq, this is what you ought to say.
[01:34:01.807 --> 01:34:07.250]  And I quote, that we are there for strategic purposes, blah, blah, blah, guard aid.
[01:34:07.330 --> 01:34:10.232]  And he missed the name because no one had a tape recorder.
[01:34:11.273 --> 01:34:12.994]  But to guard an oil pipeline.
[01:34:13.215 --> 01:34:15.216]  And he did actually get the name of that pipeline.
[01:34:16.071 --> 01:34:16.471]  Unquote.
[01:34:17.091 --> 01:34:20.712]  But he said that's what... The Hoffa, or the Haifa pipe one.
[01:34:21.772 --> 01:34:23.453]  I can't, I don't... That's one of them.
[01:34:23.473 --> 01:34:24.013]  There's several.
[01:34:24.033 --> 01:34:28.354]  There's one that goes into... Yeah, there's numerous ones there, but he didn't mention it.
[01:34:28.374 --> 01:34:29.474]  Well, why did he tell you this?
[01:34:30.714 --> 01:34:31.174]  We don't know.
[01:34:31.334 --> 01:34:34.435]  We all looked at each other like, did you actually hear what I just heard?
[01:34:34.455 --> 01:34:37.156]  We were like, we couldn't believe that we were actually hearing this.
[01:34:37.196 --> 01:34:38.776]  I mean, it just confirmed our own beliefs.
[01:34:39.420 --> 01:34:40.741]  Well, a big part of it's the oil.
[01:34:40.781 --> 01:34:45.445]  It's also about having a military launch base to invade Iran and Syria and threaten the Russians.
[01:34:46.086 --> 01:34:47.347]  And that's PNAC, folks.
[01:34:47.367 --> 01:34:48.488]  The Vice President says that.
[01:34:48.528 --> 01:34:49.169]  I'm not saying it.
[01:34:49.429 --> 01:34:49.929]  Sure.
[01:34:49.989 --> 01:34:54.914]  And that's where that all falls under the strategic purposes.
[01:34:54.954 --> 01:34:59.217]  Bush told his biographer, and a big book's coming out on that.
[01:34:59.237 --> 01:35:02.861]  He told him in 1999, I'm going to be a war president, which he said on TV himself.
[01:35:03.681 --> 01:35:04.182]  The people...
[01:35:05.131 --> 01:35:07.191]  Can't argue with you when you're in a war.
[01:35:07.311 --> 01:35:11.832]  So it's also just about having carte blanche for their whole agenda.
[01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:12.992]  But to finish up what you were saying.
[01:35:13.272 --> 01:35:19.194]  Yeah, and that just ties in, it only ties in and reinforces what you're saying, what you're putting out.
[01:35:20.914 --> 01:35:27.295]  I think what's happened is the information war is, you're having an effect.
[01:35:28.235 --> 01:35:29.775]  No doubt, you're having an effect.
[01:35:30.436 --> 01:35:32.616]  And I think that they don't realize that
[01:35:33.872 --> 01:35:36.774]  Like my father-in-law and I were having a discussion the other night.
[01:35:36.794 --> 01:35:42.799]  He's like, nowadays, information is more abundant than it was years ago.
[01:35:42.819 --> 01:35:48.943]  They can't control it like they used to be able to, meaning with the Internet.
[01:35:50.164 --> 01:35:54.127]  Yeah, they can just try to train us to be decadent slobs that don't care.
[01:35:54.307 --> 01:35:54.867]  Absolutely.
[01:35:55.208 --> 01:36:02.693]  And a person who's not informed, they're not informed on their own, only because the information's out there.
[01:36:03.477 --> 01:36:05.698]  You're showing that, obviously.
[01:36:05.738 --> 01:36:09.839]  Well, God bless you, and you say you stopped drinking the Kool-Aid, and you're getting out.
[01:36:10.419 --> 01:36:10.899]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:11.539 --> 01:36:14.580]  Yeah, my wife's been beating me over here for a long time.
[01:36:14.660 --> 01:36:19.401]  She actually has that, what I call the sixth sense that mothers have.
[01:36:19.821 --> 01:36:20.942]  Yes, intuition.
[01:36:21.402 --> 01:36:26.163]  Her alarm bell was going off way before all this stuff took place, but of course I didn't listen.
[01:36:27.858 --> 01:36:32.139]  Well, that's because the average American, the average cop or soldier is a good person.
[01:36:32.159 --> 01:36:37.041]  You want to believe your government's doing the right thing, but it isn't our government that's bad.
[01:36:37.101 --> 01:36:40.202]  It's corrupt liars in control of policy.
[01:36:40.262 --> 01:36:41.902]  But be sure and call me back, and God bless you.
[01:36:42.042 --> 01:36:42.502]  You too, Russ.
[01:36:42.642 --> 01:36:43.562]  That's a great caller.
[01:36:43.883 --> 01:36:44.823]  No, God bless you, Chris.
[01:36:44.863 --> 01:36:45.683]  Thanks for all you're doing.
[01:36:45.703 --> 01:36:52.505]  All right, I apologize to our guests for holding the last three or four minutes, but I just wanted to let that soldier, that young officer...
[01:36:53.436 --> 01:36:57.599]  Who's getting out of the military, have that say.
[01:36:57.639 --> 01:37:00.380]  Dr. Kuznick, very good to have you on, sir.
[01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:01.781]  My pleasure, Chris.
[01:37:02.021 --> 01:37:03.382]  My pleasure, Alex.
[01:37:03.442 --> 01:37:13.748]  Now, just in a nutshell, the organization you head up is one of the most prestigious when it comes to tracking policy, nuclear weapons, the proliferation, all of it.
[01:37:14.129 --> 01:37:17.691]  Describe your position and some of your background.
[01:37:19.252 --> 01:37:21.633]  Well, we founded the Nuclear Studies Institute back in 1995.
[01:37:24.102 --> 01:37:28.886]  I've been writing about nuclear issues and researching nuclear history for longer than that.
[01:37:30.748 --> 01:37:41.017]  One of the crowning jewels to my institute is we actually take students on a study abroad trip to Hiroshima and Nagasaki every summer for the commemorative events.
[01:37:41.037 --> 01:37:48.804]  We spend a lot of time with atomic bomb survivors, Japanese experts, and among the things we do is not only expose them to
[01:37:49.798 --> 01:37:51.539]  We're good to go.
[01:37:51.579 --> 01:37:51.779]  I think?
[01:38:12.449 --> 01:38:13.969]  Now, there have been some new developments.
[01:38:14.590 --> 01:38:25.432]  Some of this information was already out there, but it's getting even clearer that the Japanese had tried to unconditionally surrender, but no, no, no, we've got to drop two A-bombs on them.
[01:38:26.192 --> 01:38:32.314]  The New Scientist is reporting on your findings and other scholars' findings.
[01:38:32.874 --> 01:38:34.454]  Doctor, please go over that for us.
[01:38:36.055 --> 01:38:41.316]  I just got back a couple days ago from London where I was doing some lectures and interviews with New Scientist and others.
[01:38:42.199 --> 01:38:56.890]  The latest information that we're getting, now that we've gotten some access not only to the American archives, the Japanese archives, but now also the former Soviet archives, has filled out our picture quite a bit.
[01:38:57.831 --> 01:39:06.578]  And what's very clear at this point is not only that Truman and his close associates knew that they were alternatives to dropping the bomb,
[01:39:07.998 --> 01:39:16.866]  Not only do they know that the Japanese were trying to find acceptable surrender terms, that the main obstacle was the U.S.
[01:39:16.926 --> 01:39:27.074]  demand for unconditional surrender, which meant to them that the emperor would be tried as a war criminal and executed, and the emperor to them was a god, so they weren't going to put up with that.
[01:39:27.135 --> 01:39:30.978]  They would have fought to the death, many of them, if that's what we held on to.
[01:39:30.998 --> 01:39:35.642]  But we also knew that the Soviet Union was about to come into the war,
[01:39:37.222 --> 01:39:45.208]  Japanese military and diplomatic strategy was contingent upon the Soviet Union remaining neutral and staying out of the war.
[01:39:46.329 --> 01:39:54.615]  The Japanese had learned by the summer of 1944, they had agreed that there was no chance for military victory.
[01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:59.419]  Well, the Russians were already getting ready to grab islands, and they didn't want to be a Soviet state.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.281]  That was a very big factor.
[01:40:01.921 --> 01:40:06.905]  At Yalta, the Soviets promised to come in three months after the end of the war in Europe
[01:40:08.101 --> 01:40:13.342]  And Stalin was intent upon getting in there before the Japanese surrendered.
[01:40:13.362 --> 01:40:21.684]  He even promised significant territorial and economic concessions from Roosevelt at Yalta in return for the Soviets coming in.
[01:40:22.144 --> 01:40:26.845]  Well, they've still got a bunch of major real estate from Japan.
[01:40:27.206 --> 01:40:30.706]  What they wanted was what they had lost to Japan in the 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese War.
[01:40:33.897 --> 01:40:38.981]  And we had promised to give that back to them, or let them take that in return for them coming into the war.
[01:40:39.882 --> 01:40:55.516]  But Truman and Burns and Stimson, to some extent, decided at the end, after we had tested the bomb at Alamogordo on July 16, 1945, that maybe if we hurried up and dropped the bomb, we could preempt Soviet entry and they wouldn't get in on the kill.
[01:40:56.095 --> 01:41:11.392]  Stalin, on the other hand, wanted to expedite Soviet entry, fearing that the Japanese might surrender, and he wanted to make sure that they had begun their invasion, at least of Manchuria, before the Japanese had surrendered, because he didn't trust Truman to give him the concessions that had been promised at Yalta.
[01:41:11.752 --> 01:41:12.613]  So to basically...
[01:41:13.434 --> 01:41:17.896]  And again, this has been admitted, to intimidate the Russians, they drop A-bombs on the Japanese.
[01:41:17.916 --> 01:41:29.501]  And from the documents I've seen, the experts we've talked to, in the last few weeks there, the Japanese had basically surrendered and said, you can have all our generals, all our people, run everything, just don't take our emperor.
[01:41:29.761 --> 01:41:31.602]  And that was the one little sticking point.
[01:41:31.662 --> 01:41:37.445]  And then, of course, once they did have unconditional with the A-bombs, they did let them keep their emperor.
[01:41:37.745 --> 01:41:46.009]  Well, Alex, it's actually a little bit more complicated because the documents from the deliberations from the Japanese War Council, the Big Six, had it split three to three.
[01:41:46.529 --> 01:41:49.890]  Three of them said, just let us keep the Emperor.
[01:41:50.051 --> 01:41:56.413]  Three of them held on to other conditions and said that they had actually four conditions for surrender.
[01:41:57.214 --> 01:41:59.855]  The Emperor finally intervened to break the deadlock.
[01:42:00.335 --> 01:42:03.577]  So he intervened when they started dropping A-bombs?
[01:42:04.077 --> 01:42:06.578]  No, actually, he intervened after the Soviet invasion.
[01:42:07.997 --> 01:42:14.500]  The evidence seems overwhelming that that was much more... That's what I have read is that they had given up because the emperor came in.
[01:42:16.201 --> 01:42:18.362]  So then history really does show that.
[01:42:19.122 --> 01:42:21.743]  So they'd rather have American captors than Soviet captors.
[01:42:22.563 --> 01:42:30.949]  Yes, and for good reason, because they knew the Americans would be much more tolerant about them keeping the emperor, and they figured they could deal better with the Americans and with the Soviets.
[01:42:31.209 --> 01:42:38.475]  The Soviets were moving toward not only South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands and Manchuria, they were starting to move toward Hokkaido.
[01:42:38.495 --> 01:42:42.538]  So there was a lot of pressure internally in Japan for a couple reasons.
[01:42:42.998 --> 01:42:44.599]  One was they wanted to surrender to the Americans.
[01:42:44.639 --> 01:42:47.021]  The other was they feared a popular uprising.
[01:42:47.481 --> 01:42:49.703]  Some actually feared a communist revolution.
[01:42:50.282 --> 01:42:54.064]  In Japan, if the Soviets started to take part to the Japanese mainland.
[01:42:54.544 --> 01:42:57.226]  So they wanted to hurry up and surrender at that point.
[01:42:57.246 --> 01:42:58.487]  But we knew that was the case.
[01:42:59.027 --> 01:43:11.794]  Our own intelligence reports, for example, the April 11th report of the Joint Intelligence Staff of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says, quote, if at any time the USSR should enter the war, all Japanese will realize that absolute defeat is inevitable.
[01:43:12.313 --> 01:43:21.098]  We knew that because we'd broken the Japanese codes, and the Japanese were saying very clearly that their whole strategy revolved around keeping the Soviets out.
[01:43:21.398 --> 01:43:28.902]  And so the Russians had entered, he'd broken the deadlock, basically unconditional surrender, and it didn't matter, they dropped those two A-bombs.
[01:43:29.202 --> 01:43:31.423]  And you say this, you're quoted...
[01:43:32.223 --> 01:43:41.372]  Doctor, and the new scientist is saying that it was not just a war crime, it was a crime against humanity, and according to the U.S.
[01:43:41.532 --> 01:43:50.200]  version, official version of history, an A-bomb was dropped on Hiroshima on the 6th of August, 1945, and another on Nagasaki three days later to force Japan's surrender.
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:55.925]  The destruction was necessary to bring a rapid end to the war without the need for a costly U.S.
[01:43:56.005 --> 01:43:56.506]  invasion.
[01:43:57.106 --> 01:44:00.547]  That's what we've always been told, but that's pretty much accepted now to be a fraud.
[01:44:00.767 --> 01:44:01.887]  But you have the documents.
[01:44:02.307 --> 01:44:03.288]  Yeah, we've got documents.
[01:44:03.308 --> 01:44:15.391]  We also have the statements by almost every important American military leader who's on record saying that the atomic bombing was terrible either for moral reasons or it was militarily unnecessary.
[01:44:15.431 --> 01:44:16.131]  Well, yeah, didn't they?
[01:44:16.171 --> 01:44:18.932]  I mean, Hiroshima and Nagasaki were non-military cities.
[01:44:19.685 --> 01:44:20.505]  No, not exactly.
[01:44:20.525 --> 01:44:23.566]  Well, I'd always read that they were not major military cities.
[01:44:23.586 --> 01:44:29.088]  Truman said initially, his initial comments were that we're getting revenge and that Hiroshima was a military base.
[01:44:29.969 --> 01:44:33.070]  The ratio was about 7 to 1, civilians to military.
[01:44:33.450 --> 01:44:38.612]  It was a port from which the Japanese would send out troops to other parts of the empire.
[01:44:38.632 --> 01:44:42.133]  But it had also been bombed to rubble with all the firebombs.
[01:44:42.333 --> 01:44:44.454]  No, no, Hiroshima they had preserved.
[01:44:44.894 --> 01:44:48.335]  There were several cities that they had preserved so they could show the effects of the bomb.
[01:44:48.957 --> 01:44:50.399]  And Hiroshima was one of them.
[01:44:50.659 --> 01:44:52.040]  And they hadn't firebombed.
[01:44:52.461 --> 01:44:53.602]  Was Nagasaki?
[01:44:54.083 --> 01:44:55.945]  Nagasaki was largely preserved also.
[01:44:56.205 --> 01:44:56.585]  Oh, okay.
[01:44:56.725 --> 01:44:59.088]  And Niigata and Kokura and Kyoto.
[01:45:00.069 --> 01:45:01.551]  So they even preserved cities.
[01:45:01.591 --> 01:45:04.454]  This was part of a long-term plan, so why change it?
[01:45:04.974 --> 01:45:08.438]  And they were preserved because they weren't that militarily significant.
[01:45:09.253 --> 01:45:16.799]  During the spring and summer of 1945, the United States started firebombing the Japanese cities.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:19.762]  64 cities were destroyed by that kind of firebombing.
[01:45:20.623 --> 01:45:22.484]  And we were targeting civilian populations.
[01:45:23.004 --> 01:45:25.887]  Now, didn't that firebombing kill a lot more than the A-bombs?
[01:45:27.121 --> 01:45:28.863]  Not in individual cases.
[01:45:28.883 --> 01:45:33.829]  The one case you're probably referring to is the firebombing of Tokyo on March 9th and 10th.
[01:45:33.949 --> 01:45:36.011]  And there was that high wind and it just, yeah.
[01:45:36.051 --> 01:45:36.792]  That was terrible.
[01:45:36.892 --> 01:45:38.414]  And that killed a lot of people.
[01:45:38.774 --> 01:45:43.680]  But it got so bad with this that we were wiping out the mid-sized cities that had no significance.
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:44.441]  It reached the...
[01:45:45.803 --> 01:45:58.760]  It got so bad that Secretary of War Stimson said to President Truman, I don't want to see the United States get the reputation for outdoing Hitler in atrocities.
[01:45:59.181 --> 01:46:01.344]  That's what the Secretary of War said to Truman.
[01:46:03.522 --> 01:46:05.763]  For those who don't know, I mean, describe these.
[01:46:05.783 --> 01:46:14.727]  I mean, I remember reading reports, and again, it's been a while since I researched this, but like Saudis with like a thousand bombers bombing them with firebombs?
[01:46:15.287 --> 01:46:15.487]  Yeah.
[01:46:16.688 --> 01:46:21.750]  Which is why the atomic bomb did not have that much of an impact on the Japanese cabinet.
[01:46:22.431 --> 01:46:31.235]  The way they looked at it, the United States could send 500 planes and burn down a city, or they could send one plane and one bomb and burn down a city.
[01:46:31.275 --> 01:46:32.175]  It had the same effect.
[01:46:32.833 --> 01:46:39.197]  So the numbers killed in Hiroshima immediately were not as great as the numbers killed in Nagasaki.
[01:46:39.217 --> 01:46:41.558]  By the end of the year, there were more killed in Hiroshima.
[01:46:41.578 --> 01:46:42.879]  I mean, not Nagasaki, I mean Tokyo.
[01:46:42.899 --> 01:46:46.321]  By the end of the year, there were more killed in Hiroshima than in Tokyo.
[01:46:46.361 --> 01:46:48.822]  Yeah, but I read that at first the Tokyo firebombing was bigger.
[01:46:49.426 --> 01:46:49.906]  Initially.
[01:46:50.086 --> 01:46:54.628]  The immediate impact, like a day later, the Tokyo was definitely bigger.
[01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:57.370]  Imagine a thousand bombers every day.
[01:46:57.970 --> 01:46:59.110]  Man, that is incredible.
[01:46:59.390 --> 01:47:03.992]  I mean, that makes the blitz that the Germans did look like tinker toy behavior.
[01:47:04.533 --> 01:47:07.354]  Yeah, well, we had escalated tremendously beyond that.
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:10.121]  What type of sickos are these people?
[01:47:10.141 --> 01:47:14.382]  I mean, even if you've got to kill hundreds of thousands of children, you don't, like, relish it.
[01:47:37.728 --> 01:47:38.789]  And I don't think Truman did.
[01:47:38.829 --> 01:47:43.973]  I'm not saying Truman was an evil man who was bloodthirsty and, you know... Sounds like it to me.
[01:47:44.633 --> 01:47:51.178]  No, I would judge him more kindly than that, but I think he showed... Well, you just gave us his quote, Doctor.
[01:47:51.979 --> 01:47:53.540]  You just gave us the degenerate quote.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:48:03.267]  He said that, but... And that's what it is about war, that many people in that situation, even good people, will sometimes do terrible things.
[01:48:04.264 --> 01:48:06.125]  But you know what I think is the worst thing he did?
[01:48:06.145 --> 01:48:23.033]  The reason why I said that this wasn't just a war crime, it was a crime against humanity, is that Truman understood not only that this was a bigger, more terrible, more powerful weapon, he understood he was beginning a process that could very possibly end with the annihilation of the human species.
[01:48:23.213 --> 01:48:27.896]  Oh yeah, they knew that they were... Only time it's been used, first time and only, folks, we did it.
[01:48:28.496 --> 01:48:29.777]  Our elite did, A-bombing people.
[01:48:29.837 --> 01:48:30.497]  I knew that this was...
[01:48:31.041 --> 01:48:31.441]  Primitive.
[01:48:31.481 --> 01:48:32.541]  They knew this was puny.
[01:48:32.881 --> 01:48:38.023]  During the Manhattan Project, Edward Teller said, let's not even waste our time with the atomic bomb.
[01:48:38.043 --> 01:48:41.824]  Let's immediately go to the super bomb, because it'll be thousands of times more powerful.
[01:48:42.444 --> 01:48:56.827]  And when Oppenheimer briefed the Interim Committee on May 31st, he told them, within a couple years, we can have bombs between 10 megatons and 100 megatons in power, thousands of times bigger than the bombs that were used in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[01:48:57.167 --> 01:49:00.608]  But Truman understood this, and he said this on a number of occasions.
[01:49:01.467 --> 01:49:08.074]  The first thing he wrote about it, when he read that on April 13th, he said, I was told this was a weapon great enough to destroy the whole world.
[01:49:08.755 --> 01:49:19.684]  And then he later writes on July 25th, when he hears how powerful the test was, he says this may be the fire destruction prophesied in the Euphrates Valley era after Noah and his fabulous ark.
[01:49:20.024 --> 01:49:22.226]  Truman knew this wasn't just a bigger, more terrible bomb.
[01:49:22.606 --> 01:49:24.448]  He knew the process he was unleashing.
[01:49:24.688 --> 01:49:26.549]  People warned him that this was the outcome.
[01:49:26.850 --> 01:49:31.533]  Many of the scientists mobilized were signing petitions urging him not to use it in that way.
[01:49:31.553 --> 01:49:33.475]  The military leaders understood this.
[01:49:33.875 --> 01:49:36.697]  And yet we went ahead and did it when there was no military necessity.
[01:49:36.797 --> 01:49:43.201]  Because the military industrial complex that Ike later warned us about knew they needed a new arms race to keep it all going.
[01:49:43.562 --> 01:49:46.103]  Well, Eisenhower was among those who deplored what we did.
[01:49:46.364 --> 01:49:49.806]  In fact, he's the only American president who has condemned the atomic bombing.
[01:49:50.126 --> 01:49:50.766]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:50.787 --> 01:49:51.347]  We'll talk about it.
[01:49:54.938 --> 01:49:57.799]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:49:58.760]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:58.860 --> 01:49:59.620]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.980 --> 01:50:04.643]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.983 --> 01:50:11.726]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.066 --> 01:50:14.027]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.227 --> 01:50:17.068]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.168 --> 01:50:21.850]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.051 --> 01:50:26.453]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.693 --> 01:50:33.896]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:34.156 --> 01:50:36.597]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:50:54.142 --> 01:50:54.762]  We're good to go.
[01:51:15.094 --> 01:51:16.375]  radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:16.455 --> 01:51:22.339]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:22.540 --> 01:51:27.623]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:27.743 --> 01:51:36.570]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.630 --> 01:51:36.830]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:51:55.194 --> 01:51:57.616]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[01:51:57.856 --> 01:52:00.658]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[01:52:00.998 --> 01:52:05.041]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[01:52:05.261 --> 01:52:14.547]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, this small, beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname, Queen of Fruits, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[01:52:14.847 --> 01:52:19.770]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:32.018]  Loaded with xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found, fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.
[01:52:32.258 --> 01:52:38.282]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the mangosteen with Zango, the original mangosteen functional health beverage.

[01:52:44.285 --> 01:52:46.886]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:52:47.066 --> 01:52:48.987]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:04.858 --> 01:53:08.541]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:53:08.601 --> 01:53:19.669]  Coming up in the next hour, former Secretary of Transportation gets up there and talks about Cheney and the stand-down order on 9-11.
[01:53:20.030 --> 01:53:25.654]  C-SPAN's cameras malfunction and their archives all malfunction, but we've got it.
[01:53:26.403 --> 01:53:27.544]  And we're going to be playing that.
[01:53:27.764 --> 01:53:32.388]  And there's just a bunch about the travel advisory for South Texas because of the war going on.
[01:53:32.708 --> 01:53:36.391]  Literally hundreds dead, kidnappings, murder, burning buildings.
[01:53:36.932 --> 01:53:37.852]  Got Reuters right here.
[01:53:37.872 --> 01:53:39.113]  You'll never see it on the nightly news.
[01:53:40.154 --> 01:53:44.378]  It's just unbelievable that this is so underreported.
[01:53:44.398 --> 01:53:44.858]  That's coming up.
[01:53:44.898 --> 01:53:51.023]  I know we've got loaded phone lines for Robert and Roger and Charles and Danny and everybody, but...
[01:53:52.336 --> 01:53:55.937]  Dr. Peter Kuznick is going to be with us for five minutes into the next hour.
[01:53:55.977 --> 01:53:56.377]  That's it.
[01:53:56.397 --> 01:53:57.898]  Because I know he's very busy.
[01:53:58.358 --> 01:54:01.438]  A Hiroshima bomb carried hidden agenda.
[01:54:01.458 --> 01:54:05.879]  And again, that was actually to kick-start and escalate, the evidence shows, a Cold War.
[01:54:05.899 --> 01:54:09.000]  And then our government, the evidence shows, even helped the Soviets get it.
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:10.901]  Again, to escalate it even further.
[01:54:11.061 --> 01:54:11.961]  Big money to be made.
[01:54:12.321 --> 01:54:18.142]  And I mentioned how Eisenhower decried this in his farewell speech in 1960, saying the undue influence.
[01:54:18.602 --> 01:54:21.123]  Well, now it's the defense contractors that own the red light cameras.
[01:54:21.676 --> 01:54:22.816]  That are running the surveillance.
[01:54:23.576 --> 01:54:25.317]  Homeland Security.
[01:54:25.397 --> 01:54:29.418]  Most people in the cabinet, their wives all sit on boards making hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:54:29.878 --> 01:54:30.958]  It's a major scam.
[01:54:31.678 --> 01:54:38.360]  And we're talking to, of course, Dr. Peter Kuznick, who is the Director of Nuclear Studies Institute at American University in Washington, D.C.
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:43.121]  And just an amazing individual who's uncovered even more documents on this.
[01:54:43.641 --> 01:54:45.181]  Please continue to elaborate, sir.
[01:54:46.897 --> 01:54:54.021]  One of the interesting things is how widely this was repudiated by the top military leaders.
[01:54:54.681 --> 01:55:00.244]  Admiral William Leahy, who chaired the meetings of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and was Truman's personal Chief of Staff,
[01:55:01.093 --> 01:55:02.174]  I'll quote him.
[01:55:02.194 --> 01:55:02.394]  He says,
[01:55:22.028 --> 01:55:28.489]  He told an interviewer in 1949, he says that Truman said we'd use it only to hit military objectives.
[01:55:28.709 --> 01:55:35.091]  I quote, of course, then they went ahead and killed as many women and children as they could, which was just what they wanted all the time.
[01:55:36.631 --> 01:55:45.233]  But it was also deplored by General Douglas MacArthur, by Chester Nimitz,
[01:55:45.843 --> 01:55:54.406]  By Ernest King, Admiral King, who was the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, by Hap Arnold, who was the Chief of Staff... But what about the good old boy white trash that go, Good!
[01:55:54.526 --> 01:55:55.486]  Nuke them Japs!
[01:55:55.546 --> 01:55:57.087]  I still hear it on talk radio.
[01:55:57.707 --> 01:56:02.589]  I mean, folks, you're for burning up two-year-old babies until their heads pop?
[01:56:02.649 --> 01:56:04.729]  I mean, what's wrong with these people?
[01:56:06.130 --> 01:56:09.271]  Well, at the time, there was a lot of hatred toward the Japanese.
[01:56:09.795 --> 01:56:15.423]  You know, that we hated the... Americans hated the Japanese more than they've hated any other enemy in any war in history.
[01:56:15.463 --> 01:56:18.547]  And that was because propaganda was just now getting big with newsreels.
[01:56:18.587 --> 01:56:19.849]  Well, not just propaganda.
[01:56:19.909 --> 01:56:21.912]  It was also because of the Japanese atrocities.
[01:56:21.932 --> 01:56:24.956]  You know, the Japanese did terrible things to American soldiers.
[01:56:25.036 --> 01:56:26.418]  Not just the attack of Pearl Harbor.
[01:56:26.932 --> 01:56:31.214]  But an American soldier in combat had a 1 in 20 chance of dying in combat.
[01:56:31.234 --> 01:56:36.135]  An American soldier held as a POW by the Nazis had a 1 in 25 chance of dying.
[01:56:36.155 --> 01:56:40.837]  An American soldier held as a POW by the Japanese had a 1 in 3 chance of dying.
[01:56:40.857 --> 01:56:50.220]  No, I'm not defending the Imperial Japanese, but the scumbag Imperial class is, what, one-tenth of one percent or something?
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:54.902]  I mean, you don't go drop bombs on the little fishing peasants for fun.
[01:56:54.962 --> 01:56:55.122]  I mean...
[01:56:56.042 --> 01:56:57.223]  No, but that was the war we fought.
[01:56:57.243 --> 01:56:58.824]  It was a war waged against civilians.
[01:56:58.884 --> 01:57:04.088]  And we were very careful in Europe throughout most of the war to avoid hitting civilian populations.
[01:57:04.108 --> 01:57:05.048]  Except for Dresden.
[01:57:05.449 --> 01:57:06.770]  Yeah, and we assisted in that.
[01:57:07.310 --> 01:57:10.953]  And toward the end, we shifted and were starting to hit more of the civilian populations.
[01:57:11.013 --> 01:57:13.014]  But before that, we scrupulously avoided it.
[01:57:13.034 --> 01:57:13.915]  That's right.
[01:57:13.935 --> 01:57:16.096]  It was the British that mainly led the attack on Dresden.
[01:57:16.136 --> 01:57:17.657]  Yeah, it was almost entirely the British.
[01:57:18.358 --> 01:57:20.219]  And we went after transportation.
[01:57:20.259 --> 01:57:22.681]  We went after oil production facilities.
[01:57:25.334 --> 01:57:27.455]  Man, tribal warfare is so horrible.
[01:57:28.035 --> 01:57:30.995]  When we come back, I've got a few more questions for you, Doctor.
[01:57:33.396 --> 01:57:38.257]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:38.277 --> 01:57:39.057]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:57:53.144 --> 01:57:54.224]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.905 --> 01:57:55.725]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.485 --> 01:57:57.405]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.026 --> 01:58:01.667]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.227 --> 01:58:06.348]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:09.189]  All right, into hour number three.
[01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:12.230]  It's going to be absolutely jam-packed with news and your calls.
[01:58:12.250 --> 01:58:14.351]  Don't forget to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:18.863 --> 01:58:21.725]  And I've got to get him back on sometime for a full hour.
[01:58:22.226 --> 01:58:30.052]  He's Dr. Peter Kuznick, and he is the Director of Nuclear Studies Institute at American University in D.C.
[01:58:30.152 --> 01:58:33.514]  Very prestigious, putting out a lot of powerful information.
[01:58:35.336 --> 01:58:43.062]  And, you know, what we've been talking about, and again, I've read this, I've seen this, I've talked to people who were involved in it, most of them dead now.
[01:58:43.931 --> 01:58:48.034]  But everybody knew the Japanese had really unconditionally surrendered.
[01:58:48.455 --> 01:58:49.375]  That's my view on it.
[01:58:49.876 --> 01:58:51.837]  Okay, you could say they didn't want to give up their emperor.
[01:58:52.958 --> 01:58:56.101]  But notice that our government didn't want the emperor once they got in control.
[01:58:57.142 --> 01:58:57.642]  That was it.
[01:58:58.503 --> 01:59:03.687]  And they certainly didn't want the Soviets getting the country, and so they were ready for us to come in.
[01:59:04.067 --> 01:59:05.308]  Why'd they drop the A-bombs?
[01:59:05.628 --> 01:59:07.009]  And it's here in the New Scientist.
[01:59:07.029 --> 01:59:07.930]  They've got a big report on it.
[01:59:08.771 --> 01:59:11.193]  To basically escalate a Cold War...
[01:59:11.903 --> 01:59:14.444]  With the Russians for increased weapon sales.
[01:59:15.644 --> 01:59:18.926]  And even Eisenhower, again, gave speeches about this.
[01:59:19.346 --> 01:59:26.088]  Now, I was aware that he was against what happened there, though he was the Supreme Commander in the Western Theater.
[01:59:27.269 --> 01:59:33.991]  I was not aware that he had specifically talked about it later.
[01:59:34.011 --> 01:59:35.432]  Can you tell us about that, Doctor?
[01:59:36.272 --> 01:59:39.633]  Yeah, he spoke about it on a number of occasions.
[01:59:39.833 --> 01:59:52.997]  One, he talks about when Stimson came to brief him at Potsdam, and he says, I listened and I didn't volunteer anything because after all my war was over in Europe and it wasn't up to me, but I was getting more and more depressed just thinking about it.
[01:59:53.377 --> 01:59:56.578]  Then he asked for my opinion, so I told him I was against it on two counts.
[01:59:57.098 --> 02:00:01.059]  First, the Japanese were ready to surrender and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing.
[02:00:01.619 --> 02:00:04.780]  Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon.
[02:00:06.011 --> 02:00:18.915]  Eisenhower actually told Stephen Ambrose, the historian, that he specifically went to confront Truman and Truman's closest advisors to tell him not to use the bomb, and he was again ignored on that front.
[02:00:19.115 --> 02:00:20.095]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:00:20.115 --> 02:00:26.317]  For all his problems, these men aren't perfect, you know, going after the bonus marchers together, but Ike...
[02:00:27.456 --> 02:00:29.638]  And MacArthur and others had been in combat.
[02:00:29.678 --> 02:00:30.559]  They'd been shot.
[02:00:31.439 --> 02:00:32.701]  MacArthur, what, 12 times?
[02:00:33.161 --> 02:00:34.682]  I mean, these were men.
[02:00:34.762 --> 02:00:37.384]  And real men don't get off on killing innocent children.
[02:00:37.765 --> 02:00:43.629]  And then you've got the little bureaucrats thinking about how powerful they'll be and how it'll scare the Ruskies.
[02:00:43.649 --> 02:00:48.594]  And, you know, just doing that, it shows the difference between these individuals.
[02:00:49.134 --> 02:00:51.156]  And in the last minute and a half here, Dr.,
[02:00:52.535 --> 02:00:54.856]  Now we have DU being used in four countries.
[02:00:55.897 --> 02:00:56.757]  Of course, you're in the U.S.
[02:00:56.817 --> 02:00:58.418]  improving grounds all over the world.
[02:00:58.738 --> 02:01:01.179]  The Army's own handbooks say it's deadly poison.
[02:01:01.460 --> 02:01:05.482]  It's a heavy metal, not just radioactive, you know, in the lungs.
[02:01:06.182 --> 02:01:07.042]  They're using that.
[02:01:07.142 --> 02:01:09.284]  They're talking about doing more nuclear tests here.
[02:01:09.824 --> 02:01:11.705]  The whole new generation of nuclear weapons.
[02:01:12.045 --> 02:01:13.866]  Why start a new arms race?
[02:01:15.747 --> 02:01:19.769]  Well, the United States is actually undermining the entire nonproliferation regime.
[02:01:20.379 --> 02:01:21.420]  Partly because of U.S.
[02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:24.383]  policy, we might be on the verge of nuclear anarchy.
[02:01:24.543 --> 02:01:33.132]  The International Atomic Energy Agency reported that 40 countries now have the technology to develop nuclear weapons in a very short period of time.
[02:01:33.653 --> 02:01:36.776]  And the United States is destabilizing the nonproliferation regime.
[02:01:36.796 --> 02:01:37.136]  The U.S.
[02:01:37.577 --> 02:01:41.421]  sabotaged the NPT review meetings at the United Nations in May.
[02:01:41.841 --> 02:01:43.423]  Why is the elite doing this, doctor?
[02:01:44.341 --> 02:01:51.625]  Well, because we think that we want... We're so unilateralist at this point that we don't really care about the rest of world opinion.
[02:01:51.665 --> 02:01:55.347]  We want preemptive strikes with the capability of using nuclear weapons.
[02:01:55.627 --> 02:01:59.790]  The thing about the Bush strategy is that he wants more usable nuclear weapons.
[02:02:00.270 --> 02:02:04.872]  The reason why they want the bunker busters and the mini-nukes is because they think they're more usable.
[02:02:04.892 --> 02:02:07.514]  Yeah, because they don't have as much fallout, which is poppycock.
[02:02:08.072 --> 02:02:12.036]  They have a lot of fallout, and some of them are actually much bigger than the Hiroshima bomb.
[02:02:12.076 --> 02:02:13.116]  That's what I was about to say.
[02:02:13.937 --> 02:02:25.988]  Whenever you have one detonate, I'm no expert, not a physicist, but I know this, when one detonates at zero meters, it has a much greater yield from combining with the strata.
[02:02:26.428 --> 02:02:27.149]  Yes, exactly.
[02:02:28.033 --> 02:02:30.237]  And that's what they're planning to use.
[02:02:30.537 --> 02:02:31.619]  Well, I know you're very busy.
[02:02:31.639 --> 02:02:32.500]  We've got a three-minute break.
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:35.244]  Do you want to spend a few more minutes on the other side of the Labyrinth?
[02:02:35.564 --> 02:02:39.150]  I'm actually teaching tonight and then off to Japan tomorrow.
[02:02:39.170 --> 02:02:39.711]  I understand.
[02:02:39.751 --> 02:02:40.792]  So I'd better sign off.
[02:02:41.193 --> 02:02:42.455]  We'll get you back on.
[02:02:42.935 --> 02:02:43.316]  Thank you, sir.
[02:02:45.842 --> 02:02:52.684]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:02:53.004 --> 02:02:54.385]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:02:54.565 --> 02:02:56.765]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:02:56.925 --> 02:02:59.006]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:02:59.286 --> 02:03:04.208]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:03:04.548 --> 02:03:08.589]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[02:03:47.344 --> 02:03:48.385]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.705 --> 02:03:51.508]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.768 --> 02:03:55.932]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.352 --> 02:03:57.173]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.514 --> 02:04:02.078]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.558 --> 02:04:04.680]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:05:50.478 --> 02:05:51.098]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.778 --> 02:05:52.819]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.539 --> 02:05:54.640]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.280 --> 02:05:56.120]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.881 --> 02:05:57.781]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.801 --> 02:06:02.123]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.623 --> 02:06:06.745]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:09.106 --> 02:06:13.728]  Yeah, we just had a professor, a doctor, one of the top guys at American University.
[02:06:16.667 --> 02:06:36.898]  Coming out and discussing an article he was quoted in, among other academics, about all the documents that have come out, specifically where they said, let's drop A-bombs on Japan, even though they already want to surrender, so we can escalate a Cold War with the Russians, so you can have more weapons sales.
[02:06:38.478 --> 02:06:45.002]  And then it, of course, came out later, in the early 1950s, our government was giving, this is all admitted,
[02:06:46.605 --> 02:06:48.907]  Bomb secrets to the Russians.
[02:06:48.987 --> 02:06:58.592]  And it's all been declassified that our government officially gave it to them, and then they barbecued the Rosenbergs, who were spies, for just being a very small part of it on the periphery.
[02:06:59.593 --> 02:07:01.254]  The globalists are masters of this.
[02:07:02.194 --> 02:07:07.978]  Endangering all of us, because, well, we can't just have it where we have the A-bombs and the hydrogen weapons.
[02:07:08.618 --> 02:07:12.540]  We can't just have it where we have it, and then we won't be able to have an escalation of power.
[02:07:13.281 --> 02:07:13.921]  No, we've got a
[02:07:15.057 --> 02:07:20.340]  And then our whole economies get engineered into this military-industrial complex.
[02:07:21.701 --> 02:07:25.803]  And now Bush has these, quote, bunker busters that giggling neocons want to use.
[02:07:26.263 --> 02:07:31.466]  And yeah, most of them are bigger than the A-bombs in their yield that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
[02:07:31.906 --> 02:07:37.189]  And when you shoot one of these plutonium-based weapons...
[02:07:38.270 --> 02:07:39.231]  Into the rock.
[02:07:39.471 --> 02:07:43.193]  It binds with the metal and the rock and everything and creates incredible radiation.
[02:07:43.593 --> 02:07:45.394]  And incredible dust clouds and fallout.
[02:07:46.074 --> 02:07:52.077]  They're not clean, but comparably they're clean when you detonate them at a half mile or a mile above a city.
[02:07:52.878 --> 02:07:54.418]  You also get bigger numbers of dead people.
[02:07:54.638 --> 02:07:56.059]  But it's just the heat flash.
[02:07:56.980 --> 02:07:58.500]  And, you know, the thermal energy.
[02:07:59.021 --> 02:08:03.583]  But you start shooting them into mountains and into bunkers and into downtown areas.
[02:08:04.591 --> 02:08:13.453]  You know, it's going to blow up a couple, you know, eight or ten blocks, vaporize that, and then shower just super radioactive isotopes.
[02:08:14.213 --> 02:08:17.393]  You know, all the lead, all the mercury, all the steel.
[02:08:17.613 --> 02:08:21.174]  Oh, there's always cobalt in machinery and buildings.
[02:08:21.974 --> 02:08:26.855]  Every little bit of cobalt becomes the most nauseous radiation you can imagine.
[02:08:26.875 --> 02:08:29.215]  You come into contact with it, you are dead.
[02:08:31.516 --> 02:08:31.916]  And, uh,
[02:08:33.188 --> 02:08:35.969]  That's just from my research and all the physicists we've had on this broadcast.
[02:08:36.449 --> 02:08:39.810]  I mean, cobalt gets anywhere near what they call those dirty nukes.
[02:08:41.170 --> 02:08:47.832]  Forget the dirty bomb, you know, taking a bunch of nuclear material and just exploding it in a regular explosion to spread it out and radiate people.
[02:08:47.993 --> 02:08:48.513]  That's nothing.
[02:08:49.193 --> 02:08:50.873]  That's, you know, that's DU type stuff.
[02:08:51.434 --> 02:08:53.334]  It's bad, but it's nothing compared to that other stuff.
[02:08:54.154 --> 02:09:02.317]  But you start getting off into, well, they jacket warheads in different metals.
[02:09:03.129 --> 02:09:05.170]  And then their radiation bombs is what they are.
[02:09:05.230 --> 02:09:06.430]  But those are really nasty.
[02:09:08.111 --> 02:09:10.832]  Well, you start shooting them into ground zero, folks.
[02:09:10.852 --> 02:09:12.732]  You start shooting them into the sides of mountains.
[02:09:13.212 --> 02:09:19.054]  Those are the equivalent of jacketed warheads.
[02:09:20.395 --> 02:09:24.756]  And then you've got big, big... And that's what they're going to build thousands of?
[02:09:24.776 --> 02:09:26.797]  I mean, who are they going to use these on?
[02:09:29.472 --> 02:09:35.957]  Well, we've got Paul Harvey.
[02:09:35.977 --> 02:09:37.898]  Time to get the nukes out of their silos.
[02:09:37.938 --> 02:09:39.279]  Time to nuke Saudi Arabia.
[02:09:40.821 --> 02:09:41.541]  Nukes?
[02:09:41.941 --> 02:09:50.948]  But he loves George Bush, so he doesn't tell you that James Baker defended the Saudis against the 9-11 victims when they thought it was the Saudis that sued, which it wasn't.
[02:09:50.968 --> 02:09:56.712]  I mean, they're toadies of the Bushes and have a lot of power, but they're nothing in the larger scheme of old money.
[02:09:57.782 --> 02:10:05.010]  But the point is, you know, nuke them, but then when you find out Bush is protecting them, well, that's all right, I like him, but still nuke them.
[02:10:06.853 --> 02:10:07.553]  It's all just talk.
[02:10:07.573 --> 02:10:09.015]  They're not going to nuke the precious Saudis.
[02:10:09.536 --> 02:10:12.219]  Oh, they might nuke Iran and Syria, who've done nothing to us.
[02:10:12.839 --> 02:10:13.440]  Nothing!
[02:10:14.281 --> 02:10:16.003]  What about the suicide bombers?
[02:10:16.043 --> 02:10:17.425]  That's a bunch of lies.
[02:10:18.630 --> 02:10:23.953]  In Syria and Iran, they're constantly arresting people who are militants, who do want to blow stuff up.
[02:10:24.374 --> 02:10:25.894]  And they put out newspaper reports.
[02:10:25.955 --> 02:10:27.495]  We are not violent against the U.S.
[02:10:27.816 --> 02:10:29.297]  We are not for terrorism.
[02:10:29.357 --> 02:10:31.218]  You are carrying out the terror, America.
[02:10:31.658 --> 02:10:33.299]  You are carrying out the terror, Israel.
[02:10:33.899 --> 02:10:39.663]  Here is a link in the Tehran Times to the Jerusalem Post admitting you carry out terror to blame it.
[02:10:39.723 --> 02:10:40.163]  It's true.
[02:10:41.624 --> 02:10:47.968]  And I'm not defending the corrupt mullahs over there in their palaces, but the point is, compared to our elite, these guys are as pure as a driven snow.
[02:10:50.072 --> 02:10:56.776]  And, you know, they want to create all these new hydrogen bombs to start hydrogen bunker busters.
[02:10:56.796 --> 02:10:57.916]  They're not bunker busters.
[02:10:57.936 --> 02:10:58.937]  They're mountain busters.
[02:10:59.377 --> 02:11:02.018]  And they turn the mountains into radioactive slag heaps.
[02:11:02.599 --> 02:11:11.023]  And, by the way, they are now saying they're going to do more testing with this stuff.
[02:11:11.123 --> 02:11:13.024]  And then they've come out and admitted 11,000 U.S.
[02:11:13.305 --> 02:11:17.727]  citizens died just from the nuclear test alone of the A-bombs.
[02:11:19.358 --> 02:11:26.284]  And they knew full well when they told our troops to sit a mile away from ground zero.
[02:11:26.364 --> 02:11:30.148]  I mean, fire would literally sweep over some of them in their ditches.
[02:11:30.528 --> 02:11:31.669]  Dust, they'd breathe it all.
[02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:37.334]  And they wondered, well, man, I've got a tumor the size of a baseball two years later.
[02:11:40.557 --> 02:11:41.818]  By the way, it has come out in the news.
[02:11:41.838 --> 02:11:45.261]  They did a biopsy on John Wayne's lung, and it had uranium in it.
[02:11:45.973 --> 02:11:49.556]  Of course, you know, he was there for like two years on two different films, shooting two different movies.
[02:11:51.217 --> 02:11:52.979]  You know, where they did the nuclear testing.
[02:11:53.039 --> 02:11:54.820]  I mean, it's not good for you folks.
[02:11:56.261 --> 02:11:57.482]  But he also smoked cigarettes.
[02:11:57.502 --> 02:11:59.464]  But the point is, they did find uranium in his lungs.
[02:11:59.924 --> 02:12:03.167]  Which I know is nutritious, and you know, I'm evil for saying it's bad for you.
[02:12:03.187 --> 02:12:07.391]  Alright, let's just go quickly to your calls, and I just got a whole pass on this.
[02:12:08.011 --> 02:12:08.992]  There's so much of it.
[02:12:09.072 --> 02:12:10.713]  Charles in Tennessee, go ahead.
[02:12:12.815 --> 02:12:13.796]  You're on the air, Charles.
[02:12:15.518 --> 02:12:15.938]  He's gone.
[02:12:15.998 --> 02:12:16.938]  I'll let him go.
[02:12:17.438 --> 02:12:18.059]  You there now, sir?
[02:12:18.499 --> 02:12:19.399]  Oh, this ain't Charles.
[02:12:19.419 --> 02:12:20.779]  This is Steve from Indiana.
[02:12:21.059 --> 02:12:21.319]  All right.
[02:12:21.339 --> 02:12:22.520]  We'll figure out the call someday.
[02:12:23.120 --> 02:12:26.961]  They play musical board ops on me, so... But go ahead, Steve, in Indiana.
[02:12:27.181 --> 02:12:27.441]  Okay.
[02:12:28.301 --> 02:12:30.141]  Alex, I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
[02:12:30.642 --> 02:12:33.502]  And I live right next to the former Jefferson Proving Ground.
[02:12:33.802 --> 02:12:34.062]  Yes.
[02:12:34.102 --> 02:12:37.303]  Where they fired over 15,000 tons of depleted uranium.
[02:12:39.804 --> 02:12:43.345]  Our town's within, you know, five miles from the impact area.
[02:12:44.925 --> 02:12:45.085]  And...
[02:12:45.563 --> 02:12:48.325]  You know, I live in a small town where there's only 500 people.
[02:12:49.066 --> 02:12:51.248]  It's like a supercell of cancer here now.
[02:12:51.268 --> 02:12:54.270]  Do you know anywhere where we can get any help?
[02:12:55.611 --> 02:13:04.019]  Well, by supercell, they have these areas where they admit, you know, next to a chemical plant or next to these areas where, you know, you have thousands of times higher cancer.
[02:13:04.479 --> 02:13:08.783]  I'm not familiar with your town, so I don't know.
[02:13:09.663 --> 02:13:13.967]  Well, we're not officially listed, you know, but, you know, I've found every other person in
[02:13:14.557 --> 02:13:16.338]  The town has had some form of cancer.
[02:13:17.378 --> 02:13:19.018]  And what do they do at the DU?
[02:13:19.118 --> 02:13:20.799]  Are they manufacturing?
[02:13:22.479 --> 02:13:25.800]  No, this was an Army proving ground where they shot the rounds.
[02:13:25.900 --> 02:13:26.220]  Oh, yeah.
[02:13:26.820 --> 02:13:28.421]  Sorry, your phone was cutting out when you said that.
[02:13:28.641 --> 02:13:30.941]  Yeah, the proving grounds, you're definitely in grave danger.
[02:13:31.322 --> 02:13:34.002]  I would move away from there so fast and make my head spin.
[02:13:34.522 --> 02:13:35.283]  Make your head spin.
[02:13:36.143 --> 02:13:37.783]  Yeah, well, they've closed it down now.
[02:13:37.883 --> 02:13:38.804]  That means nothing.
[02:13:38.844 --> 02:13:41.104]  That stuff has a four and a half billion year half-life.
[02:13:41.324 --> 02:13:42.065]  Yes, I know that.
[02:13:42.645 --> 02:13:43.505]  It isn't so much...
[02:13:44.142 --> 02:13:45.223]  I mean, it's not good for you.
[02:13:45.763 --> 02:13:47.023]  Just from the heavy metal effects.
[02:13:47.444 --> 02:13:52.426]  It's like a super heavy metal, you know, to have the sabot rounds and the rest of it, but they're all encased.
[02:13:52.846 --> 02:13:53.086]  Yeah.
[02:13:53.326 --> 02:13:59.089]  And normally, you know, even in the Vulcan guns and the 18 Warhawks, there's a thin layer of plastic over the tips of them.
[02:14:00.229 --> 02:14:02.450]  And that's done so you don't get contaminated.
[02:14:02.710 --> 02:14:08.593]  But no, when they're shooting old tanks up and having proving grounds and bombing grounds, that gets in the water, that gets in the air.
[02:14:09.033 --> 02:14:11.094]  There's 10 proving grounds in the U.S.,
[02:14:11.835 --> 02:14:16.698]  And I guess you're near one of the big ones, and oh yeah, boy, that is really bad, sir.
[02:14:17.158 --> 02:14:17.378]  Yes.
[02:14:18.179 --> 02:14:23.882]  Well, I was just wondering if you knew where we could get any kind of help or anything, but I sure appreciate what you're doing.
[02:14:24.182 --> 02:14:30.406]  You know, you need to first educate the people of your town, and I would get the video we're offering that is Beyond Treason.
[02:14:31.289 --> 02:14:31.729]  Okay.
[02:14:31.909 --> 02:14:34.791]  And it's on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[02:14:35.291 --> 02:14:35.531]  Yes.
[02:14:36.112 --> 02:14:44.976]  And I would get that video, and I think Joyce Riley, she's the producer of it, I think she'll probably, you need to call her, but we're selling it.
[02:14:45.016 --> 02:14:46.237]  You need to get authorization.
[02:14:46.257 --> 02:14:48.178]  I think she'll probably let you make copies of it there in the town.
[02:14:48.658 --> 02:14:55.242]  She might even come to the town and speak, but there are a lot of big groups out there exposing DU.
[02:14:55.282 --> 02:14:59.024]  But if I was you, I would just get the Army's own manual from 92.
[02:15:00.797 --> 02:15:01.177]  Okay.
[02:15:01.237 --> 02:15:04.539]  Because that will shut the neocon bootlickers up real fast.
[02:15:04.860 --> 02:15:09.603]  When you have the Army manual and the Army training videos, those are also available.
[02:15:10.403 --> 02:15:11.944]  You can get them from the Department of Defense.
[02:15:11.964 --> 02:15:12.945]  The clips are online.
[02:15:12.965 --> 02:15:15.366]  We've linked to them where they admit how deadly it is.
[02:15:15.406 --> 02:15:18.088]  But it's the aerosolized DU.
[02:15:18.568 --> 02:15:20.670]  It's when it hits something, it turns into dust.
[02:15:21.130 --> 02:15:21.330]  Right.
[02:15:21.690 --> 02:15:22.571]  And it never goes away.
[02:15:22.611 --> 02:15:26.213]  I mean, as far as I'm concerned, four and a half billion years is for good.
[02:15:26.833 --> 02:15:27.054]  Yes.
[02:15:27.434 --> 02:15:27.654]  Yes.
[02:15:28.374 --> 02:15:29.075]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[02:15:29.744 --> 02:15:30.564]  Thank you for the call.
[02:15:30.604 --> 02:15:31.505]  I really appreciate it.
[02:15:32.465 --> 02:15:36.107]  Yeah, it's just the most deadly... You know, Dr. Rocky's described it.
[02:15:37.407 --> 02:15:39.628]  It's better described as a deadly poison.
[02:15:40.629 --> 02:15:42.069]  Okay, I mean, that's really what it is.
[02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:44.410]  It just never goes away.
[02:15:44.990 --> 02:15:46.551]  It never oxidizes.
[02:15:46.611 --> 02:15:47.672]  It never breaks down.
[02:15:47.732 --> 02:15:50.373]  It never gets absorbed and passed to the body.
[02:15:50.453 --> 02:15:52.193]  It just goes in your lungs and bones.
[02:15:53.014 --> 02:15:55.855]  And then it has a radiological effect...
[02:15:56.750 --> 02:16:04.253]  It's like saying breathing radiation from a hydrogen bomb going off is like grabbing a hold of a high-powered tension line.
[02:16:04.293 --> 02:16:05.033]  Here's the analogy.
[02:16:05.733 --> 02:16:15.096]  DU is like having a low-voltage plug that just hurts, but if you sat there and held your finger on it for a month, it's going to mess you up.
[02:16:16.417 --> 02:16:24.420]  And the New York Daily News did a test of the troops two years ago from the start of this war.
[02:16:24.440 --> 02:16:25.360]  People were getting sick.
[02:16:26.101 --> 02:16:28.723]  And they had upwards of two rims of radiation.
[02:16:29.563 --> 02:16:34.666]  And the new scientists, those guys again did a great job, did lung scans.
[02:16:35.847 --> 02:16:38.389]  I mean, you take a lung scan, it's clouded.
[02:16:38.449 --> 02:16:39.890]  I mean, it's full of DU.
[02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:48.655]  And these are all people who lived in barracks that were bombed or were involved in battlefield situations or play around on tanks they bombed.
[02:16:49.956 --> 02:16:51.417]  And it's just the facts.
[02:16:52.257 --> 02:16:55.079]  And people are in such abject denial
[02:16:57.779 --> 02:16:58.199]  About it.
[02:16:58.259 --> 02:16:59.480]  You know, it's just not true.
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:00.001]  No, no, no.
[02:17:00.021 --> 02:17:02.742]  You're trying to undermine our troops by saying this is evil propaganda.
[02:17:03.023 --> 02:17:04.443]  You know, Rush Limbaugh says that.
[02:17:05.304 --> 02:17:07.465]  Folks, we told you forever aspartame was bad.
[02:17:07.526 --> 02:17:09.107]  Now it's admitted.
[02:17:09.127 --> 02:17:09.987]  It was always admitted.
[02:17:10.327 --> 02:17:11.548]  You know, mercury's deadly.
[02:17:11.568 --> 02:17:12.689]  They told you it wasn't bad for you.
[02:17:12.729 --> 02:17:13.610]  Now they claim they took it out.
[02:17:13.650 --> 02:17:14.870]  They didn't take it out of the vaccines.
[02:17:15.451 --> 02:17:16.712]  Stannis fluoride is deadly.
[02:17:17.832 --> 02:17:20.014]  I mean, we post these reports every day.
[02:17:21.275 --> 02:17:23.176]  And I know a lot of you out there who love the...
[02:17:24.358 --> 02:17:30.846]  Bill Clinton or love George Bush, can't read and write and are about as ignorant as a, you know, bucket of maggots.
[02:17:31.566 --> 02:17:34.410]  But still, I mean, you need to get it through your fat heads.
[02:17:35.291 --> 02:17:39.075]  I know you associate your power with George Bush because he's retarded like you are.
[02:17:39.796 --> 02:17:42.499]  But you need to wake up and get smart and save you and your family.
[02:17:42.979 --> 02:17:43.500]  Be right back.

[02:17:55.577 --> 02:18:01.442]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[02:18:01.563 --> 02:18:07.528]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[02:18:07.848 --> 02:18:11.532]  One packet of Gano Cafe is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.

[02:19:46.234 --> 02:19:50.137]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:19:50.357 --> 02:20:02.644]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:20:03.065 --> 02:20:03.465]  The U.S.
[02:20:03.505 --> 02:20:09.088]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:09.489 --> 02:20:11.690]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:20:13.551 --> 02:20:14.032]  We're good to go.
[02:20:34.387 --> 02:20:34.587]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[02:21:48.784 --> 02:21:54.786]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:55.406 --> 02:21:58.367]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.588 --> 02:22:06.070]  You know, my heart goes out to the last caller living in a town by a proving ground where they used DU.
[02:22:06.110 --> 02:22:14.974]  You ought to just find the mindless idiots who think DU's good for you and have them buy your business from you and get out of there.
[02:22:15.894 --> 02:22:19.395]  I know quite a few morons around here that think DU is not bad for you.
[02:22:20.935 --> 02:22:25.636]  So, you know, I'd say get in contact with them and sell them your business and get out of there.
[02:22:26.037 --> 02:22:30.998]  Look, if you live anywhere near the 10 proving grounds in the United States, get away from them.
[02:22:32.418 --> 02:22:36.219]  And I don't mean proving grounds where they're, you know, missiling and bombing things with normal munitions.
[02:22:36.239 --> 02:22:36.939]  That's no problem.
[02:22:37.780 --> 02:22:43.361]  I'm talking about if it's one of the 10 DU proving grounds, you don't want to be anywhere near that.
[02:22:44.091 --> 02:22:48.292]  Plus, there's more radiation in the atmosphere than there was, you know, 50, 60 years ago.
[02:22:48.332 --> 02:22:49.012]  That's admitted.
[02:22:50.313 --> 02:22:57.074]  From the hundreds of tests we did, the hundreds the Russians did, the dozens the Chinese have done, the dozens the French and British have done.
[02:22:57.094 --> 02:22:59.615]  I don't know, the French did like 50-something.
[02:22:59.635 --> 02:23:00.655]  They still do them sometimes.
[02:23:02.096 --> 02:23:03.396]  The British did 40-something.
[02:23:03.736 --> 02:23:04.836]  The Russians did hundreds.
[02:23:04.856 --> 02:23:05.397]  We did hundreds.
[02:23:05.857 --> 02:23:09.858]  Above ground, I got this film called, what's it called?
[02:23:09.898 --> 02:23:10.878]  I bought it from History Channel.
[02:23:13.687 --> 02:23:17.109]  It's like the name of one of the proving grounds out of Nevada.
[02:23:18.590 --> 02:23:23.934]  And it just shows where they fire like 50 missiles up into the upper atmosphere and detonate nukes.
[02:23:24.854 --> 02:23:28.957]  And it caused electromagnetic pulses and radios all over the world.
[02:23:29.717 --> 02:23:30.998]  Electronics blew up.
[02:23:31.914 --> 02:23:33.195]  And they just do it again.
[02:23:33.215 --> 02:23:34.455]  That was back in the 60s.
[02:23:34.955 --> 02:23:37.317]  Here, let's just blow holes in space.
[02:23:37.337 --> 02:23:38.497]  In fact, they admitted it.
[02:23:38.537 --> 02:23:44.020]  They just shot them up into the edge of space and were blowing holes in the ozone, blowing holes.
[02:23:44.100 --> 02:23:46.221]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:23:46.301 --> 02:23:53.604]  And now I saw a San Francisco Chronicle article last year where they just quietly announced, oh, the Air Force has developed antimatter bombs.
[02:23:54.145 --> 02:23:57.006]  These can destroy the whole planet, but it remains classified.
[02:23:57.566 --> 02:23:58.747]  Why would you build that?
[02:23:59.907 --> 02:24:01.128]  Who in their right mind...
[02:24:01.894 --> 02:24:03.320]  We'll build an antimatter bomb.
[02:24:05.262 --> 02:24:09.384]  I mean, I know for the mindless idiots out there that just, I like big bums.
[02:24:09.404 --> 02:24:11.024]  They make me feel powerful.
[02:24:11.644 --> 02:24:15.966]  It's people like you that the anti-gunners point at and then make fun of pro-gun people.
[02:24:16.446 --> 02:24:17.047]  I love guns.
[02:24:17.067 --> 02:24:18.087]  They're incredible instruments.
[02:24:18.107 --> 02:24:18.747]  They're beautiful.
[02:24:19.067 --> 02:24:20.008]  They're well-crafted.
[02:24:20.068 --> 02:24:21.148]  I love the marksmanship.
[02:24:21.428 --> 02:24:23.369]  And I love them because they're a symbol of my freedom.
[02:24:23.749 --> 02:24:29.271]  But the sickos that worship the gun because they're such cowardly wimps, they give guns a bad name.
[02:24:29.451 --> 02:24:31.552]  And you give weapons a bad name, period.
[02:24:31.832 --> 02:24:32.813]  All right, I'm going to shut up.
[02:24:32.853 --> 02:24:33.773]  There's callers waiting.
[02:24:34.358 --> 02:24:37.861]  Danny in Alabama, then Mike, Richard, many others.
[02:24:37.881 --> 02:24:38.662]  Go ahead, Danny.
[02:24:38.682 --> 02:24:39.983]  Hello, Alex.
[02:24:40.023 --> 02:24:46.049]  The first thing I'd like to do is commend you on your obvious passion behind your effort to wake people up.
[02:24:46.850 --> 02:24:53.796]  Unfortunately, it's discouraging that too many people have grown accustomed to hitting the snooze button when the wake-up call comes.
[02:24:54.857 --> 02:24:59.641]  One thing I'd like to ask you is that I want to confirm what I heard you say earlier with...
[02:25:00.848 --> 02:25:06.194]  About the mercury testing and that the government said that they've taken the mercury out of these vaccines.
[02:25:06.415 --> 02:25:07.536]  And that's not true.
[02:25:08.097 --> 02:25:12.602]  I know it's not true, but what I would like to say is, now, I did a Google search.
[02:25:12.642 --> 02:25:15.846]  There are personal mercury test kits out there.
[02:25:16.627 --> 02:25:17.788]  And people can buy these.
[02:25:17.808 --> 02:25:18.609]  They're fairly cheap.
[02:25:19.070 --> 02:25:20.752]  People can buy them, and when they go...
[02:25:21.638 --> 02:25:23.039]  For these vaccines and stuff.
[02:25:23.099 --> 02:25:27.942]  Hey, I'll shoot a little bit in this test kit and then find out the amount of mercury that's in this stuff.
[02:25:28.003 --> 02:25:29.343]  Well, there's an easier way to do it.
[02:25:29.704 --> 02:25:30.004]  Oh, yeah?
[02:25:30.104 --> 02:25:36.989]  The reason the AP last year picked up on it and said, contrary to the popular belief, it's not been removed, it's been increased.
[02:25:37.669 --> 02:25:41.792]  And we have that AP article in the vaccine section of prisonplanet.com.
[02:25:42.172 --> 02:25:48.477]  You demand to see the vaccine box and the insert and look for the word thimerosal.
[02:25:49.673 --> 02:25:52.436]  Yeah, I've seen that.
[02:25:53.196 --> 02:26:02.023]  Listen, I've got so much family that are nurses and doctors and dentists and physicians, and my wife's family is almost entirely medical people.
[02:26:03.124 --> 02:26:06.367]  And believe me, the mercury is in all of it.
[02:26:06.767 --> 02:26:08.248]  See, you've got the big manufacturers.
[02:26:08.788 --> 02:26:15.574]  What they did is they made available in small lots non-mercury vaccines.
[02:26:16.312 --> 02:26:17.812]  But they don't even advertise it.
[02:26:18.313 --> 02:26:19.913]  The drug reps don't talk about it.
[02:26:20.273 --> 02:26:22.254]  You've got to specially order it.
[02:26:24.134 --> 02:26:26.995]  Well, where can you find it?
[02:26:27.015 --> 02:26:28.075]  Well, you have to order it.
[02:26:28.095 --> 02:26:30.736]  I mean, some vaccines are good and are needed, like tetanus.
[02:26:31.316 --> 02:26:37.958]  The problem is the UN's been caught adding the hormones to tetanus to sterilize people about 10 different times in the last 20 years.
[02:26:37.978 --> 02:26:38.858]  That's mainstream news.
[02:26:39.738 --> 02:26:45.620]  Also, the stuff they give your kids at free clinics like at Zilker Park today, come down.
[02:26:45.680 --> 02:26:46.520]  It's the law.
[02:26:46.741 --> 02:26:47.201]  No, it's not.
[02:26:47.221 --> 02:26:48.541]  It's so criminal.
[02:26:49.061 --> 02:26:49.822]  That's criminal.
[02:26:50.462 --> 02:26:51.322]  It's the law and it's not.
[02:26:51.342 --> 02:26:53.663]  The cops should be out there arresting those people, folks.
[02:26:54.003 --> 02:26:55.984]  But instead, come down and get your shot.
[02:26:56.084 --> 02:27:00.205]  And usually in these free clinics, it is old junk vaccine.
[02:27:00.785 --> 02:27:01.826]  That's even worse.
[02:27:02.726 --> 02:27:05.727]  Yeah, well, that upsets me because I travel overseas.
[02:27:05.767 --> 02:27:06.647]  I work overseas.
[02:27:06.667 --> 02:27:08.848]  And they've hit me so many times for different...
[02:27:09.932 --> 02:27:14.596]  Vaccines for typhoid, yellow fever, and all this kind of stuff.
[02:27:15.237 --> 02:27:16.678]  I'm going to stop taking these.
[02:27:17.379 --> 02:27:19.641]  Well, you've got to be careful, as you know, if you're going to Africa.
[02:27:19.681 --> 02:27:21.363]  There's some stuff even worse than the mercury.
[02:27:21.403 --> 02:27:26.067]  Yeah, well, I'm going to Africa, in fact, probably next week.
[02:27:26.107 --> 02:27:26.407]  Stay there.
[02:27:26.508 --> 02:27:27.328]  I need to talk to you then.
[02:27:27.348 --> 02:27:28.329]  I need to tell you something.
[02:27:28.890 --> 02:27:29.250]  Stay there.
[02:27:29.550 --> 02:27:30.351]  I've got a break.
[02:27:30.812 --> 02:27:32.113]  These breaks fire automatically.
[02:27:32.593 --> 02:27:33.114]  I'll be right back.
[02:27:36.059 --> 02:27:36.961]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.461 --> 02:27:39.063]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.965 --> 02:27:42.648]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:29:55.309 --> 02:29:57.650]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?

[02:30:29.754 --> 02:30:32.237]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[02:30:32.437 --> 02:30:34.239]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[02:30:34.279 --> 02:30:38.805]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.
[02:30:39.045 --> 02:30:41.388]  That's N-U-K-A-L-E-R-T dot com.
[02:30:41.488 --> 02:30:41.988]  Or call 830-672-8734.
[02:31:01.485 --> 02:31:13.576]  Number one, if you have a high level of mercury, a toxic level of mercury in your body, there are ways to detox.
[02:31:16.838 --> 02:31:19.681]  And I never even covered it last week and this week.
[02:31:19.721 --> 02:31:25.226]  It's come out, I'm sure it was all over the news, that babies in the womb are like toxic waste dumps.
[02:31:26.201 --> 02:31:28.922]  The children, especially, they test their blood.
[02:31:28.942 --> 02:31:32.243]  They're just full of every chemical you can imagine.
[02:31:32.963 --> 02:31:34.943]  The environment is so toxic.
[02:31:36.364 --> 02:31:37.064]  It's so bad.
[02:31:38.024 --> 02:31:41.145]  And look, we all live fast and got so much work to do.
[02:31:41.165 --> 02:31:44.586]  The world's built to where we're not healthy and do bad things to ourselves.
[02:31:44.626 --> 02:31:48.307]  But at least eat organic foods a few meals a day.
[02:31:48.387 --> 02:31:49.407]  Don't eat the fast food.
[02:31:49.427 --> 02:31:50.728]  Don't eat the bleached flour.
[02:31:51.068 --> 02:31:54.789]  Because the bleaching chemicals, admittedly, in that are...
[02:31:56.494 --> 02:32:01.396]  More than anything, what's causing all this escalation in diabetes.
[02:32:01.436 --> 02:32:08.399]  Because that chemical actually, it's admitted, burns out the pancreas.
[02:32:09.139 --> 02:32:10.139]  So that's what's happening.
[02:32:11.080 --> 02:32:12.500]  And there's just so much, folks.
[02:32:13.261 --> 02:32:15.581]  Plus, good organic food just tastes better.
[02:32:16.142 --> 02:32:17.702]  And good food that's cooked up tastes better.
[02:32:17.742 --> 02:32:18.803]  Just stop eating crap.
[02:32:19.363 --> 02:32:22.044]  I mean, for years, I just ate garbage because I was so busy.
[02:32:22.777 --> 02:32:26.601]  And it's been a slow process of getting off of all of this stuff, but I feel a lot better.
[02:32:27.121 --> 02:32:28.502]  And I only drink filtered water.
[02:32:29.503 --> 02:32:33.387]  Got Temi Morrow coming up in just a second, but I mean, haven't had her on in about two or three weeks.
[02:32:34.287 --> 02:32:35.829]  But this big report, you know, comes out.
[02:32:35.889 --> 02:32:39.952]  Most cities have Prozac and Ritalin in the water, or birth control hormones in the water.
[02:32:40.773 --> 02:32:44.517]  And the chlorine and stuff just kills the bacteria.
[02:32:44.537 --> 02:32:45.978]  You're drinking all those dead bacteria.
[02:32:46.989 --> 02:32:48.450]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:32:48.871 --> 02:32:52.594]  But, Danny in Alabama, you say you're going to Africa soon, huh?
[02:32:53.615 --> 02:33:00.040]  I'm going to start out in Luanda, and they're going to move me on up to Milongo, up near Cabinda.
[02:33:01.421 --> 02:33:02.302]  It's in the oil business.
[02:33:02.722 --> 02:33:05.344]  Well, you've got to really worry about... Marburg.
[02:33:06.325 --> 02:33:06.585]  Yeah.
[02:33:07.045 --> 02:33:08.426]  They've got Marburg out there now.
[02:33:08.447 --> 02:33:11.689]  They've given out a lot of notices to us on board ship for that.
[02:33:12.009 --> 02:33:16.333]  But I would worry a lot more about just the mosquitoes and the malaria than Marburg.
[02:33:17.162 --> 02:33:21.185]  Yeah, well, they've given us new stuff they call larium.
[02:33:21.265 --> 02:33:23.707]  I mean, not larium, but what's the name of it?
[02:33:23.827 --> 02:33:26.509]  I don't even take it because I stay offshore most of the time.
[02:33:26.549 --> 02:33:31.332]  I'm very seldom at the beach, but I stay offshore and mosquitoes aren't out there as much.
[02:33:31.732 --> 02:33:32.653]  I take my chances.
[02:33:32.733 --> 02:33:33.734]  Plus, I use good scent.
[02:33:33.794 --> 02:33:40.198]  You know, if I do walk outside at night in Anchorage, I wear long sleeves and stuff like that and only go outside if I have to.
[02:33:40.719 --> 02:33:42.700]  And I carry this mosquito repellent.
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:45.642]  Boy, for those that don't know, I mean, it's like...
[02:33:46.451 --> 02:33:49.494]  Ninety percent of people that go end up getting malaria.
[02:33:49.514 --> 02:33:50.474]  Yeah, I know.
[02:33:50.615 --> 02:33:57.360]  Quite a few of my friends that work with me down in Brazil for a while, they went to Africa just one trip, and they ended up dying.
[02:33:57.380 --> 02:33:58.981]  There's about three or four of them died of malaria.
[02:34:00.082 --> 02:34:00.482]  I know.
[02:34:01.143 --> 02:34:04.205]  And the drugs themselves are almost as bad as the malaria.
[02:34:04.225 --> 02:34:06.687]  Yeah, on the box for larium.
[02:34:06.848 --> 02:34:09.169]  Now, it stays on the box.
[02:34:09.209 --> 02:34:11.671]  For a long use of this will make you go blind.
[02:34:11.732 --> 02:34:12.172]  I mean, you're like...
[02:34:12.833 --> 02:34:17.517]  Well, you know, you take a 50-50 chance of getting malaria, or a 100% chance of going black.
[02:34:17.957 --> 02:34:19.879]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:34:20.640 --> 02:34:22.121]  I appreciate it.
[02:34:22.321 --> 02:34:26.384]  Folks, this isn't a joke, and it's very, very serious.
[02:34:29.707 --> 02:34:35.172]  Debbie Morrow, I couldn't think of a better introductory call to you coming on
[02:34:36.216 --> 02:34:44.764]  Did you see the big report last week about how toxic the average American is because of all the poisons in the water and the food, Debbie?
[02:34:45.064 --> 02:34:54.172]  No, I did not hear the report, and I would love to read it, so I'm going to have to find out where I can read it, because that will be good information.
[02:34:54.672 --> 02:34:55.593]  Well, we posted it.
[02:34:55.933 --> 02:35:01.418]  Sounds like somebody's playing ping pong in there.
[02:35:02.808 --> 02:35:04.229]  The Berkey Sport Bottle.
[02:35:04.530 --> 02:35:05.671]  Oh, really?
[02:35:05.851 --> 02:35:07.793]  I was just getting a drink and dropped it.
[02:35:08.313 --> 02:35:10.976]  Hey, that's... No, I want some.
[02:35:11.016 --> 02:35:12.497]  Just having some fun with you, Debbie.
[02:35:12.737 --> 02:35:13.018]  I know.
[02:35:13.078 --> 02:35:14.659]  It's been a while since we had you on.
[02:35:14.679 --> 02:35:15.840]  You've got to come on more often.
[02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:17.001]  You know, and I'm so...
[02:35:18.334 --> 02:35:21.996]  Sorry, because I love being on your show and I do try and be on it more.
[02:35:22.296 --> 02:35:24.457]  But we've been really busy, which has been good.
[02:35:24.698 --> 02:35:30.401]  And sometimes I get busy working and I don't... Hey, I totally understand.
[02:35:30.941 --> 02:35:34.063]  Folks seem to never get prepared until there's a bus bombing or something.
[02:35:34.583 --> 02:35:44.267]  And then that seems to scare them, and I better get my Berkey water filter because, you know, Al-Qaeda might nuke us next week because that rumor is out there, which I don't really put a lot of stock in, folks.
[02:35:44.727 --> 02:35:47.308]  I think the globalists at some point will pull something big like that.
[02:35:47.348 --> 02:35:49.709]  But, no, the war is here.
[02:35:50.129 --> 02:35:51.750]  The crisis is ongoing.
[02:35:52.550 --> 02:36:01.697]  And it's what's in the water, Debbie, and you guys have got made in America super high quality water filters.
[02:36:01.937 --> 02:36:08.502]  That's correct, and that's the thing that I keep trying to explain to people is this isn't just a preparedness item.
[02:36:08.623 --> 02:36:12.866]  If you think you're buying it just for preparedness, then, you know...
[02:36:14.210 --> 02:36:20.253]  I really wish that you wouldn't think like that, because Berkey is something you want to use every single day.
[02:36:20.713 --> 02:36:27.557]  Berkeys are for your health now, not for something in the future.
[02:36:27.697 --> 02:36:29.658]  We want to be healthy now, you know?
[02:36:29.678 --> 02:36:38.562]  Well, Debbie, once you have been drinking real purified water for a month, I challenge people, try to go back to tap water.
[02:36:38.942 --> 02:36:40.343]  It tastes like kerosene.
[02:36:40.763 --> 02:36:43.785]  It really does, and I'll tell you how I can give you my...
[02:36:45.010 --> 02:36:52.837]  I have not drank my household water in years.
[02:36:54.158 --> 02:36:56.440]  I forget what was going on the other day.
[02:36:56.460 --> 02:37:01.445]  I turned on the tap, I was doing something, and I was thirsty.
[02:37:01.465 --> 02:37:06.529]  So I just grabbed a glass and put some water in it and took a drink of it.
[02:37:07.945 --> 02:37:11.368]  I just tasted like dirt.
[02:37:12.009 --> 02:37:18.794]  And apparently Grapevine, where I live, is supposed to be the cleanest, best tasting water in all of Texas.
[02:37:18.834 --> 02:37:19.855]  They win awards.
[02:37:20.516 --> 02:37:22.718]  And it tasted like a mouthful of dirt.
[02:37:22.758 --> 02:37:23.518]  It was so bad.
[02:37:23.538 --> 02:37:30.985]  And it reminded me how good our Berkey water really is and how we get so used to that good tasting water.
[02:37:32.210 --> 02:37:33.731]  Well, absolutely.
[02:37:34.351 --> 02:37:38.654]  And you guys are the big national distributor of the British Berkeys, if folks want those.
[02:37:38.714 --> 02:37:42.236]  But you are the makers of the American Berkey.
[02:37:42.296 --> 02:37:45.018]  You have it in stainless steel and an Alexan see-through.
[02:37:45.618 --> 02:37:48.220]  And it is an improvement.
[02:37:48.260 --> 02:37:51.521]  Your black elements have been tested by major universities.
[02:37:51.541 --> 02:37:52.682]  You have all that information.
[02:37:53.062 --> 02:37:55.504]  It cuts everything out to non-detectable levels.
[02:37:55.524 --> 02:37:58.966]  That means under an electron microscope, you can find nothing.
[02:37:59.606 --> 02:38:04.628]  This has set a new standard, and they're patriots, and it's all right here in America.
[02:38:05.388 --> 02:38:06.868]  What more do you need?
[02:38:07.068 --> 02:38:08.869]  Give Debbie a call.
[02:38:09.009 --> 02:38:10.949]  If you've already got a big Berkey, get a spare.
[02:38:11.469 --> 02:38:12.310]  Give them as gifts.
[02:38:12.470 --> 02:38:15.831]  You know, every Christmas I give a couple Berkeys as gifts.
[02:38:15.871 --> 02:38:16.771]  Debbie can attest to that.
[02:38:16.811 --> 02:38:17.531]  I call and buy them.
[02:38:18.511 --> 02:38:22.593]  In fact, a few times this year I've already bought sports bottles as gifts.
[02:38:22.653 --> 02:38:23.793]  I bought some for my sister.
[02:38:24.801 --> 02:38:32.724]  Who was going to some kind of school trip, New Guinea or something, and everybody in her group but her and her girlfriend got sick.
[02:38:33.124 --> 02:38:36.486]  Their water filters didn't work or they didn't use their water filters.
[02:38:36.806 --> 02:38:38.726]  They used theirs and they didn't get sick.
[02:38:38.747 --> 02:38:39.827]  They didn't get diarrhea.
[02:38:40.227 --> 02:38:42.328]  They didn't get Montezuma's Revenge.
[02:38:43.340 --> 02:38:48.344]  They didn't get anything because they had big Berkey Sports bottles.
[02:38:48.364 --> 02:38:49.785]  Now, that's the little $20 units.
[02:38:49.865 --> 02:38:51.446]  If you get five of them, it's $100.
[02:38:52.007 --> 02:38:53.728]  Normally about $35 in stores.
[02:38:53.788 --> 02:38:57.911]  But real fast, Debbie, what are two of the big specials you're running right now?
[02:38:58.632 --> 02:39:10.301]  Well, of course, we have the Berkey Light Special where you get the Berkey Light without lights for $199 and you get a free sport bottle, or with lights for $259 and you get the choice of two sport bottles.
[02:39:10.899 --> 02:39:11.019]  Okay.
[02:39:30.413 --> 02:39:33.515]  And right now we're giving away some free sport bottles with them.
[02:39:33.816 --> 02:39:38.419]  We have a lot of people out there who've been waiting to get the stainless steel units.
[02:39:39.159 --> 02:39:41.261]  Now, are you still offering that for $225?
[02:39:41.781 --> 02:39:50.027]  No, that was the Royal Berkey with the two ceramic filters, and that is still available for people who want... That is the best.
[02:39:50.087 --> 02:39:52.549]  That thing's normally $350, folks.
[02:39:52.629 --> 02:39:52.909]  Right.
[02:39:53.269 --> 02:39:58.033]  And that'll be with two of the British... Seriously, they've been sponsors for five years...
[02:39:58.713 --> 02:39:59.193]  Okay?
[02:39:59.673 --> 02:40:04.354]  I bought stuff from them seven years ago, so understand, I've never heard deals this good.
[02:40:05.614 --> 02:40:05.935]  Period.
[02:40:06.455 --> 02:40:08.095]  What's the other deal, Debbie?
[02:40:08.415 --> 02:40:13.156]  Well, the main best thing is that now you can get the black filters in stainless steel.
[02:40:13.636 --> 02:40:15.036]  Except for in California.
[02:40:15.076 --> 02:40:18.837]  Of course, California, you have to get the Lexan ones for your California listeners.
[02:40:19.217 --> 02:40:20.678]  People always ask why that is.
[02:40:20.698 --> 02:40:21.838]  Do they have weird rules?
[02:40:22.598 --> 02:40:23.338]  It is.
[02:40:23.378 --> 02:40:26.979]  The state of California liked the Big Berkey stainless steel so much
[02:40:27.526 --> 02:40:39.691]  They decided to classify it as an in-home water filter system, and when they did that, it put it in a category that had a whole bunch of rules and regulations, and it's just a bunch of craziness.
[02:40:40.371 --> 02:40:42.432]  All because they certified it as really good.
[02:40:42.672 --> 02:40:43.633]  Yeah.
[02:40:43.993 --> 02:40:50.856]  And so what we do is we have the beautiful Lexan Berkey that is available in California, and
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:40:55.902]  We're more than happy to send those, and anywhere.
[02:40:55.922 --> 02:40:59.183]  You know, I have the Lexan one, and I love it.
[02:40:59.203 --> 02:41:01.645]  Yeah, I got one of those, and I got like three stainless.
[02:41:01.665 --> 02:41:03.185]  Hey, Debbie, let me give folks the number.
[02:41:03.205 --> 02:41:03.686]  Okay.
[02:41:03.806 --> 02:41:04.066]  It's 1-888-803-4438.
[02:41:04.086 --> 02:41:04.586]  Give Debbie Meyer a call.
[02:41:04.606 --> 02:41:04.666]  1-888-803-4438.
[02:41:04.686 --> 02:41:06.707]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get those discounts.
[02:41:18.673 --> 02:41:19.894]  If the phone's busy, call back.
[02:41:19.994 --> 02:41:21.834]  If not, call right back and leave your name and number.
[02:41:21.854 --> 02:41:29.998]  So call you back, 1-888-803-4438, or go to BerkeyWater.com and tell them in the comments section it's an Alex Jones special.
[02:41:30.358 --> 02:41:31.498]  Debbie, don't be a stranger.
[02:41:31.538 --> 02:41:32.419]  I love talking to you.
[02:41:32.679 --> 02:41:37.341]  Oh, I love calling you, too, and I will be more diligent about getting in more often.
[02:41:37.521 --> 02:41:38.081]  You're awesome.
[02:41:38.101 --> 02:41:38.901]  Thank you so much.
[02:41:38.921 --> 02:41:39.522]  Thank you.
[02:41:39.582 --> 02:41:40.042]  Take care.
[02:41:40.242 --> 02:41:40.542]  Bye.
[02:41:40.602 --> 02:41:42.303]  Now we're in a hurry now, folks.
[02:41:42.363 --> 02:41:42.883]  We're going to go.
[02:41:43.760 --> 02:41:46.781]  To Mike and Michael and Russell.
[02:41:47.021 --> 02:41:48.941]  And Mike, we'll jam you in.
[02:41:48.961 --> 02:41:51.602]  I've got a few other news caps that I want to cover.
[02:41:51.642 --> 02:41:55.543]  But this is a very, very, very important article.
[02:41:55.663 --> 02:41:59.304]  Mineta testimony on Cheney and Standown shoot-down censored.
[02:42:00.304 --> 02:42:08.466]  Mineta's Presidential Emergency Operations Center's testimony was also edited out of the 9-11 Commission video archive and questioned.
[02:42:09.355 --> 02:42:10.655]  Now he's in the room with him.
[02:42:10.715 --> 02:42:12.756]  He describes a conversation between Cheney and a young man.
[02:42:38.644 --> 02:42:42.067]  And then, since it's about four minutes long, it gets to it later in the clip.
[02:42:42.587 --> 02:42:43.208]  Stay with us.
[02:42:43.748 --> 02:42:45.870]  We'll hit a few other news items and take your calls.
[02:42:46.190 --> 02:42:46.610]  Stay with us.
[02:42:46.650 --> 02:42:47.451]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:50.353 --> 02:42:52.655]  Very exciting audio, isn't it, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:42:55.077 --> 02:42:56.138]  We're going to go ahead now.
[02:42:56.218 --> 02:42:58.259]  We're going to play the Cheney Minetta clip.
[02:42:58.840 --> 02:43:00.241]  We're going to play the testimony clip.
[02:43:01.262 --> 02:43:01.982]  Are we ready with that?
[02:43:02.182 --> 02:43:07.807]  I wanted to focus just a moment on the Presidential Emergency Operating Center.
[02:43:09.241 --> 02:43:11.742]  You were there for a good part of the day.
[02:43:11.802 --> 02:43:13.563]  I think you were there with the Vice President.
[02:43:14.824 --> 02:43:26.909]  And we had that order given, I think it was by the President, that authorized the shooting down of commercial aircraft that were suspected to be controlled by terrorists.
[02:43:28.730 --> 02:43:30.531]  Were you there when that order was given?
[02:43:30.551 --> 02:43:32.852]  No, I was not.
[02:43:32.872 --> 02:43:38.335]  I was made aware of it during the time that the airplane coming in
[02:43:39.008 --> 02:43:39.889]  To the Pentagon.
[02:43:41.270 --> 02:43:46.834]  There was a young man who would come in and say to the Vice President, the plane is 50 miles out.
[02:43:47.574 --> 02:43:48.975]  The plane is 30 miles out.
[02:43:49.836 --> 02:43:59.323]  And when it got down to the plane is 10 miles out, the young man also said to the Vice President, do the orders still stand?
[02:44:00.624 --> 02:44:05.608]  And the Vice President turned and clipped his neck around and said,
[02:44:06.305 --> 02:44:07.606]  Of course the orders still stand.
[02:44:08.146 --> 02:44:09.827]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[02:44:09.847 --> 02:44:13.028]  Well, at the time I didn't know what all that meant.
[02:44:13.048 --> 02:44:20.272]  The flight you're referring to is the... The flight that came into the Pentagon.
[02:44:21.793 --> 02:44:27.735]  And so I was not aware that that discussion had already taken place.
[02:44:29.496 --> 02:44:35.019]  But in listening to the conversation between the young man and the vice president,
[02:44:36.157 --> 02:44:43.041]  Then at the time I didn't really recognize the significance of that.
[02:44:44.301 --> 02:44:54.286]  And then later I heard of the fact that the airplanes had been scrambled from Langley to come up to D.C.
[02:44:54.307 --> 02:44:58.269]  But those planes were still about 10 minutes away.
[02:44:58.289 --> 02:45:03.051]  And so then at the time we heard about
[02:45:04.295 --> 02:45:13.200]  The airplane that went into Pennsylvania, then I thought, oh my God, did we shoot it down.
[02:45:13.220 --> 02:45:21.305]  And then we had to, with the Vice President, go through the Pentagon to check that out.
[02:45:21.965 --> 02:45:23.526]  Let me see if I understand.
[02:45:23.686 --> 02:45:32.411]  The plane that was headed toward the Pentagon and was some miles away, there was an order to shoot that plane down.
[02:45:34.053 --> 02:45:49.599]  Well, I don't know that specifically, but I do know that the airplanes were scrambled from Langley or from Norfolk, the Norfolk area.
[02:45:50.600 --> 02:46:00.824]  And so, but I did not know about the order specifically other than listening to that other conversation.
[02:46:02.004 --> 02:46:05.425]  But there very clearly was an order to shoot commercial aircraft.
[02:46:05.445 --> 02:46:07.826]  Subsequently, I found that out.
[02:46:11.808 --> 02:46:20.551]  With respect to Flight 93, what type of information were you and the Vice President receiving about that flight?
[02:46:22.431 --> 02:46:28.093]  The only information we had at that point was when it went into
[02:46:31.306 --> 02:46:32.326]  When it crashed.
[02:46:32.547 --> 02:46:32.867]  I see.
[02:46:32.887 --> 02:46:35.368]  You didn't know beforehand about that airplane.
[02:46:35.469 --> 02:46:35.869]  Did not.
[02:46:36.829 --> 02:46:40.852]  And so there was no specific order there to shoot that plane down.
[02:46:40.872 --> 02:46:43.394]  No, sir.
[02:46:44.695 --> 02:46:51.159]  But there were military planes in the air in position to shoot down commercial aircraft.
[02:46:51.339 --> 02:46:51.760]  That's right.
[02:46:51.820 --> 02:46:56.583]  The planes had been scrambled, I believe, from Otis at that point.
[02:46:57.640 --> 02:46:58.361]  All right, folks.
[02:46:58.561 --> 02:47:00.302]  Now, why is this important?
[02:47:00.362 --> 02:47:05.087]  Because we know that he gave an order, which they say is classified under national security.
[02:47:05.947 --> 02:47:21.000]  And we know from witnesses, and this was in a command bunker under the White House with about 100 people in it, all in and around it, and then here is Bennett admitting it, that the staffer walks in and goes, does it still stand?
[02:47:21.021 --> 02:47:22.662]  And he says, yes, the order still stands.
[02:47:23.832 --> 02:47:32.014]  And we know that order was for the F-16s that were all around that whole morning.
[02:47:32.054 --> 02:47:33.934]  I mean, they knew minute one.
[02:47:34.494 --> 02:47:43.196]  We know Dick Cheney also gave the order that the F-16s could only fly at, what was it, 320-something miles an hour, which is right above stall speed.
[02:47:44.117 --> 02:47:46.497]  The things were meant to cruise at 1,400 miles an hour.
[02:47:47.697 --> 02:47:49.378]  But the planes stall at around 310 miles an hour.
[02:47:51.672 --> 02:47:53.973]  And, you know, they're not coming into an angle for a landing.
[02:47:54.653 --> 02:47:56.854]  So, you know, there's your stand-down order.
[02:47:56.894 --> 02:48:02.576]  But the point is, is that this is cut off of the 9-11 Commission's website.
[02:48:03.036 --> 02:48:04.317]  C-SPAN, you couldn't get it.
[02:48:04.817 --> 02:48:06.718]  It was cut off.
[02:48:08.278 --> 02:48:10.459]  It was cut out of the 9-11 report.
[02:48:10.759 --> 02:48:18.722]  You know, they gave the text in their appendix website of everything Mineta said, but that was all removed.
[02:48:19.528 --> 02:48:22.951]  And I'm sorry it has that weird sound in the background.
[02:48:24.512 --> 02:48:25.853]  It's like a science fiction movie.
[02:48:25.893 --> 02:48:31.838]  Who would have ever thought that if you download video off the web and then play it on the radio, it has that weird electronic sound.
[02:48:32.499 --> 02:48:38.044]  But those are actually audio remnants or artifacts.
[02:48:38.104 --> 02:48:41.306]  It's a weird digital thing, so it makes that weird computer sound.
[02:48:41.767 --> 02:48:43.168]  We'll be right back, folks.
[02:48:43.188 --> 02:48:43.608]  Stay with us.
[02:48:47.481 --> 02:48:50.362]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:50.602 --> 02:48:52.162]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:50:47.856 --> 02:50:48.457]  We're good to go.
[02:50:48.477 --> 02:50:48.617]  I think?
[02:51:11.718 --> 02:51:12.539]  We're good to go.
[02:51:33.715 --> 02:51:37.556]  There's been some really big new developments with the London bombing and in more BBC reports.
[02:52:02.424 --> 02:52:14.450]  Where it was being put out that the Transportation for London Department and other departments were doing the drills.
[02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:17.411]  So, a lot of new stuff there.
[02:52:17.431 --> 02:52:23.434]  I'm going to try to jam three calls in here at the end, but be sure and go to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com and get those stories.
[02:52:24.414 --> 02:52:30.517]  Let's go ahead now and go to, I guess up next here is Mike in Arizona.
[02:52:30.557 --> 02:52:31.157]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:52:31.917 --> 02:52:34.939]  Yes, hi Alex.
[02:52:34.959 --> 02:52:34.999]  Hi.
[02:52:35.059 --> 02:52:36.300]  Your guess was half right.
[02:52:36.320 --> 02:52:42.124]  Part of the reason for the dropping of the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was to inaugurate the Cold War.
[02:52:42.845 --> 02:52:48.969]  But the other reason, which was probably more significant, was to validate the United Nations.
[02:52:49.827 --> 02:52:53.969]  You remember Bernard Baruch played a very important role in all this.
[02:52:54.069 --> 02:52:56.410]  Yeah, now we've got to have a global government to stop this.
[02:52:56.430 --> 02:52:57.991]  It was meant to scare the people of the world.
[02:52:58.231 --> 02:52:59.031]  It was terrorism.
[02:52:59.271 --> 02:52:59.472]  Right.
[02:52:59.892 --> 02:53:07.075]  He was, of course, the agent of the Rothschild banking dynasty in this country, or one of the agents of the Rothschilds in this nation.
[02:53:08.136 --> 02:53:15.179]  He played a fairly minor role in World War I. Well, I couldn't say it was minor, but he was the head of the War Production Board.
[02:53:15.640 --> 02:53:25.408]  Remember after World War I, he told men like Joe Kennedy that we've made you all millionaires, now we'll get the next war started and make you all billionaires.
[02:53:26.449 --> 02:53:32.294]  So making money was certainly part of the plan, but a bigger part of the plan was to drop the bomb.
[02:53:32.914 --> 02:53:40.501]  And like an Old Testament prophet, he went before the United Nations and said, you can either have the blessings or the curses.
[02:53:40.521 --> 02:53:43.083]  You can have the blessings of the United Nations and have peace,
[02:53:43.621 --> 02:53:49.126]  Or you can have the curse of imminent holocaust by the atomic bomb waiting for you.
[02:53:49.466 --> 02:53:50.347]  You know, your choice.
[02:53:50.547 --> 02:53:59.715]  No, it was to just launch a century of fear that we're now in the middle of, and it was just meant to create total control, and it was meant to energize world government.
[02:53:59.815 --> 02:54:00.676]  Oh, you're absolutely right.
[02:54:01.297 --> 02:54:08.023]  Yeah, so, you know, I remember this is the man who had his little parkside bench chats with Roosevelt and...
[02:54:09.958 --> 02:54:12.619]  And Truman basically telling them what to do.
[02:54:12.639 --> 02:54:14.120]  He's the one who gave the instructions.
[02:54:14.340 --> 02:54:15.180]  Oh, I agree with you.
[02:54:15.260 --> 02:54:15.661]  Very good.
[02:54:15.701 --> 02:54:17.461]  Write an article and send it to me, Mike.
[02:54:18.362 --> 02:54:21.823]  So this has already been done by... No, I know it has, but it's good to recap.
[02:54:21.843 --> 02:54:22.544]  Thanks for the call.
[02:54:23.484 --> 02:54:24.825]  Richard in Louisiana.
[02:54:24.865 --> 02:54:25.525]  Go ahead, Richard.
[02:54:26.065 --> 02:54:26.586]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:26.946 --> 02:54:27.186]  Hi.
[02:54:27.206 --> 02:54:27.846]  Thank you.
[02:54:27.866 --> 02:54:28.586]  I love your show.
[02:54:29.307 --> 02:54:36.030]  Another reason Nagasaki and Hiroshima were picked was because out of all the Japanese cities, they were the few most...
[02:54:37.031 --> 02:54:38.772]  Predominantly Roman Catholics.
[02:54:38.832 --> 02:54:39.352]  You know, it's funny.
[02:54:39.392 --> 02:54:40.472]  Those were Christian cities.
[02:54:40.492 --> 02:54:41.153]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:54:41.853 --> 02:54:49.155]  Also, Iraq was the most predominantly Christian Arab country over there in the Middle East right now.
[02:54:49.295 --> 02:54:53.157]  Well, it was the most industrialized and the most friendly, yeah.
[02:54:53.177 --> 02:55:00.039]  So not only are they sending a message to the world that America was sending a message to the Russians, but also to the Pope.
[02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:03.200]  Let them know there's a new power in town.
[02:55:03.240 --> 02:55:04.701]  There's a new player on the block.
[02:55:05.916 --> 02:55:07.278]  Alright, thanks for the call, Richard.
[02:55:07.318 --> 02:55:07.998]  Very interesting.
[02:55:08.079 --> 02:55:08.539]  Russell?
[02:55:09.240 --> 02:55:12.123]  Russell, you're on the air from Texas.
[02:55:12.163 --> 02:55:13.084]  Go ahead, last caller.
[02:55:13.525 --> 02:55:14.085]  Hey, Alex, man.
[02:55:14.486 --> 02:55:14.726]  Hi.
[02:55:14.886 --> 02:55:17.189]  Doing a good job on the videos, man, and your team does too.
[02:55:17.769 --> 02:55:24.377]  But I've got a point to mention that is addressing the topic that the older gentleman called in about the wristwatch thing, the dosimeter.
[02:55:25.094 --> 02:55:28.475]  And then on the other network that you and he called in on yesterday?
[02:55:28.715 --> 02:55:34.556]  Yeah, he was basically saying that there wasn't radiation, so the DU isn't bad.
[02:55:34.796 --> 02:55:43.038]  Right, well, there's a big distinction between the radiation field and the source it comes from, being the particulate or the dust or whatever.
[02:55:43.058 --> 02:55:50.540]  Just because if something passes the radiation field, it doesn't now become its own source unless it has that particulate or contamination on it.
[02:55:51.069 --> 02:55:59.992]  So if this guy's Geiger counter, if it's calibrated to read depleted uranium, U-238, which it may not pick up anyway... Well, that's another thing.
[02:56:00.032 --> 02:56:02.472]  They have to be calibrated for specific isotopes.
[02:56:02.692 --> 02:56:02.873]  Right.
[02:56:03.353 --> 02:56:03.713]  I know.
[02:56:03.773 --> 02:56:04.773]  You can't tell them that.
[02:56:04.813 --> 02:56:05.693]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[02:56:05.713 --> 02:56:07.394]  I thought about that yesterday.
[02:56:07.654 --> 02:56:10.695]  I'm going to have nuclear physicists on and Rocky and...
[02:56:11.798 --> 02:56:12.839]  Well, he's a nuclear physicist.
[02:56:13.100 --> 02:56:18.406]  I'm going to have them all on, and, you know, but I'm sure some toothless white trash, he knows more than we do.
