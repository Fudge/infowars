[00:00:05.747 --> 00:00:06.387]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.048 --> 00:00:08.088]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:09.929]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.390]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.151 --> 00:00:13.071]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:17.414]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.894 --> 00:00:21.997]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.491 --> 00:00:37.932]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:38.032 --> 00:00:39.713]  It is Tuesday, the 29th day of November, 2005.
[00:00:39.753 --> 00:00:41.593]  And we're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:41.673 --> 00:00:42.214]  Jordan Maxwell.
[00:00:49.631 --> 00:01:05.063]  We'll be with us for the second and most of the third hour today talking about the secret societies, the Illuminati, illumined ones that are controlling our world and the society that they're trying to build.
[00:01:05.103 --> 00:01:06.444]  You want to talk about the elite?
[00:01:07.024 --> 00:01:09.126]  You want to talk about the elite families?
[00:01:09.186 --> 00:01:10.326]  Who's controlling things?
[00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:11.427]  Who is behind things?
[00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:18.833]  Jordan Maxwell has done a lot of really deep investigation of Babylon, Egyptology...
[00:01:20.022 --> 00:01:27.148]  The Illuminati and some of the more modern movements, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, you name it.
[00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:29.590]  It'll be riveting.
[00:01:29.951 --> 00:01:30.711]  You don't want to miss it.
[00:01:30.731 --> 00:01:32.413]  It'll be his debut on this broadcast.
[00:01:32.913 --> 00:01:37.857]  I've been familiar with his work for at least 10 years, but this will be his debut.
[00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:42.361]  Miami police take new track against terror.
[00:01:43.862 --> 00:01:47.766]  This is the most in-your-face, most insane, most on-its-face...
[00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:51.149]  Ridiculousness I've ever seen.
[00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.352]  And we'll talk about it coming up.
[00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:58.135]  Just wait until you hear what they're going to be doing to you.
[00:01:59.055 --> 00:02:04.680]  You thought it was bad in Denver where they march onto buses and demand to see everybody's IDs and they don't even really want to look at them.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.521]  It's about making you comply.
[00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:07.442]  Well, this is even worse.
[00:02:09.356 --> 00:02:13.178]  And Paul Watson's written the article, American Police State the Frog Has Cooked.
[00:02:13.198 --> 00:02:16.941]  It's up on prisonplanet.com right now about this latest story.
[00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:18.221]  I commend Paul.
[00:02:18.261 --> 00:02:25.625]  As soon as this came out last night in the Associated Press, he had written an article in about 20 minutes and got it up even before Drudge did.
[00:02:27.206 --> 00:02:29.988]  New home sales hit record level in October.
[00:02:30.808 --> 00:02:33.290]  They're saying this could be the last hurrah before the bust.
[00:02:34.452 --> 00:02:37.855]  And gold has now surged above $500 an ounce.
[00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:46.801]  Platinum smashing through the psychological barrier of $1,000 per ounce.
[00:02:50.343 --> 00:02:53.165]  You talk about massive Orwellian spin.
[00:02:54.286 --> 00:02:56.268]  Bush talks tough on immigration.
[00:02:56.688 --> 00:02:59.390]  President says guest worker plan is an amnesty.
[00:03:00.871 --> 00:03:03.813]  And I've got CNN, I've got AP, I've got Fox News.
[00:03:04.858 --> 00:03:11.423]  Last night I watched a little bit of TV before I went on air with Renz to do his show, Jeff Renz.
[00:03:13.405 --> 00:03:23.412]  And yesterday evening I was listening to talk radio, driving around in the car, and I heard Neocons going, the liberals are trying to stop Bush right now, but he's a real conservative.
[00:03:23.753 --> 00:03:26.535]  He's going to fight through them and do something about immigration.
[00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.111]  He's going to be traveling around in the Southwest dealing with it.
[00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:31.792]  His plan will deal with it.
[00:03:31.852 --> 00:03:33.013]  The liberals want to stop it.
[00:03:33.374 --> 00:03:35.055]  His plan was written up by Democrats.
[00:03:35.095 --> 00:03:36.396]  His plan is total amnesty.
[00:03:36.736 --> 00:03:37.857]  And the neocons know that.
[00:03:37.937 --> 00:03:39.738]  They'll tell you it's conservative.
[00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.800]  You'll capitulate to total amnesty.
[00:03:42.841 --> 00:03:45.082]  And you'll feel good about yourselves.
[00:03:46.363 --> 00:03:49.045]  I mean, that's how this actually works.
[00:03:50.987 --> 00:03:52.608]  This is literally happening.
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.223]  And the neocons, I mean, they'll come out and say, them Democrats don't want a national ID card.
[00:03:58.243 --> 00:03:59.725]  I actually heard them saying this.
[00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:05.209]  The Real ID Act, actually, Democrats outvoted Republicans.
[00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.432]  I tell you, that Clinton ain't for the war.
[00:04:09.492 --> 00:04:11.353]  He ain't good like Bush.
[00:04:11.674 --> 00:04:17.218]  Meanwhile, Lieberman, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, they're all running around, foaming at the mouth, pushing the war.
[00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.232]  It's just how they... And Democrats.
[00:04:21.332 --> 00:04:22.273]  I love Bill Clinton.
[00:04:22.533 --> 00:04:23.874]  He's fighting the evil war.
[00:04:24.195 --> 00:04:24.795]  No, he's not.
[00:04:24.815 --> 00:04:26.156]  He's out there cheerleading for it.
[00:04:26.437 --> 00:04:27.477]  They're crime partners.
[00:04:27.497 --> 00:04:28.979]  They deal cocaine together.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.322]  I've interviewed the people that unloaded the cocaine.
[00:04:34.444 --> 00:04:36.265]  Decorated CIA officers.
[00:04:37.706 --> 00:04:38.567]  They're crooks.
[00:04:38.607 --> 00:04:40.929]  They're mafia dons.
[00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.994]  But they've got fancy PR firms and fancy suits and Ivy League...
[00:04:46.972 --> 00:04:52.737]  And British educations, and you just sit there and just buy all their stinking frauds.
[00:04:52.777 --> 00:04:53.898]  I'll cover the news when we get back.
[00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:54.398]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.484 --> 00:05:05.807]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.987 --> 00:05:10.331]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:12.637 --> 00:05:14.960]  Use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.844]  The New World Order can emerge.
[00:05:18.104 --> 00:05:22.329]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:29.318]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:31.481]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:42.248]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.448 --> 00:05:47.852]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.332 --> 00:05:50.994]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[00:05:52.254 --> 00:05:54.056]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:01.144 --> 00:06:09.747]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:21.250]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.131]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:24.451 --> 00:06:28.552]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:06:28.912 --> 00:06:39.156]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:39.417 --> 00:06:45.079]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.340]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:06:50.081 --> 00:06:50.781]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:02.586 --> 00:07:06.051]  Government is best which governs the... Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:07:06.491 --> 00:07:09.195]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:07:09.636 --> 00:07:12.279]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:19.169]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:20.210]  We're good to go.
[00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.690]  We're good to go.
[00:07:40.024 --> 00:07:41.466]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:07:41.646 --> 00:07:41.987]  Have you?
[00:07:42.567 --> 00:07:44.069]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[00:07:44.529 --> 00:07:48.253]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[00:07:48.273 --> 00:07:52.298]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:07:52.738 --> 00:07:53.799]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:55.541]  Osama bin forgotten.
[00:07:55.982 --> 00:07:59.626]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[00:08:01.149 --> 00:08:06.193]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:08.875]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:28.288]  The official federal plan four years ago, just weeks after 9-11...
[00:08:31.619 --> 00:08:45.046]  Was to literally train you, they even openly talked about this in policy papers, to openly train you to accept the surveillance, line up and show your papers, shut up, you're in the Reich now type system.
[00:08:46.547 --> 00:08:48.708]  You're in the New World Order now, boy, shut up.
[00:08:48.748 --> 00:08:50.989]  And you didn't ask to join, you're a slave.
[00:08:53.986 --> 00:09:00.531]  And the government talked about how they were going to do it on trains, buses, bridges, highways.
[00:09:00.551 --> 00:09:02.953]  They're going to build hardened checkpoints into the roads.
[00:09:03.673 --> 00:09:04.874]  They're going to search you.
[00:09:04.914 --> 00:09:07.115]  They're just going to randomly shut down highways and do it.
[00:09:07.676 --> 00:09:14.861]  And they admit that, quote, while we're looking for terrorists, we'll also look for drugs, guns, and other paraphernalia.
[00:09:15.561 --> 00:09:19.084]  Mixing the word guns in with drugs and other paraphernalia.
[00:09:21.118 --> 00:09:36.066]  And all over the nation, they have begun to do this, whether it's in Miami or in San Francisco or in New York or Detroit or Chicago, and it has nothing to do with security.
[00:09:37.967 --> 00:09:46.932]  Well, there is a new flagrant article that just goes over the top that we'll be covering here in a few minutes.
[00:09:48.132 --> 00:09:49.293]  Miami police take new
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.741]  Attack against terror.
[00:09:53.162 --> 00:09:54.723]  Or a new direction against terror.
[00:09:55.703 --> 00:09:59.025]  And then Paul Watson did write the article, American Police State the Frog is Cooked.
[00:09:59.045 --> 00:10:03.027]  I want to cover those and then get into some of the economic indices.
[00:10:04.588 --> 00:10:06.369]  And then get into the latest abomination.
[00:10:06.429 --> 00:10:08.050]  Bush is back after a year.
[00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:13.734]  And it was hailed by neocons as he's really getting tough on immigration.
[00:10:13.934 --> 00:10:15.955]  And it is total, complete legalization.
[00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:20.690]  It never ends.
[00:10:21.491 --> 00:10:22.231]  It never ends.
[00:10:25.033 --> 00:10:26.914]  And another great patriot has died.
[00:10:27.174 --> 00:10:30.136]  I just became aware of this this morning reading my email.
[00:10:30.156 --> 00:10:38.460]  Remember the professor who had the course called 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, named after my video?
[00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:41.182]  The Road to Tyranny, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:10:41.702 --> 00:10:43.603]  She died of cancer over the weekend.
[00:10:43.623 --> 00:10:47.926]  It had been a long five-year battle, but we'll talk a little bit about her as well today.
[00:10:49.444 --> 00:11:01.131]  Before I get into all the news, though, before I forget in this first hour, because Jordan Maxwell, to expose the power behind the throne, the globalist, is joining us in the second and third hours.
[00:11:01.191 --> 00:11:02.652]  Today we'll have open phones for that.
[00:11:03.552 --> 00:11:05.954]  My new film is out, and it's a doubleheader.
[00:11:06.074 --> 00:11:12.898]  It's Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, re-edited, updated, remastered, new video clips, new audio.
[00:11:15.387 --> 00:11:18.389]  New images, just really, really a better film now.
[00:11:18.869 --> 00:11:24.712]  It was always a good video, but now it's got the more modern, glossy look to it.
[00:11:25.352 --> 00:11:40.220]  I made Bohemian Grove, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, in about three weeks on an old analog three-quarter inch deck down at the local Lexus station just overnight in, I don't know, ten sessions or so.
[00:11:41.061 --> 00:11:47.646]  When I got back from California because we were getting death threats and other things, and I knew I needed to get the film out in case something happened.
[00:11:48.026 --> 00:11:49.147]  That's how you protect yourself.
[00:11:49.167 --> 00:11:50.127]  So I churned it out.
[00:11:51.288 --> 00:12:00.395]  Well, five years later, it's been the five-year anniversary back in July that we infiltrated, myself and Mike Hanson, back in July 2000, the elite satanic compound.
[00:12:02.636 --> 00:12:05.899]  I have now re-edited and remastered it with my good friend Rob Jacobson.
[00:12:06.979 --> 00:12:10.021]  And we've put this out on the...
[00:12:12.083 --> 00:12:14.044]  CD is also a whole new film.
[00:12:14.945 --> 00:12:17.747]  Some of my best work, titled The Order of Death.
[00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:26.292]  A satanic secret society rules the world, discover their history, and their master plan.
[00:12:26.372 --> 00:12:36.899]  The Order of Death, filmmaker Alex Jones exposes the connections between Bohemian Grove, Skull and Bones, and other secret occult networks whose roots date back to ancient Egypt and Babylon.
[00:12:38.363 --> 00:12:41.809]  Our entire society is ruled and controlled by deep occultists.
[00:12:42.751 --> 00:12:44.955]  Alex Jones, I'm just reading them back to you.
[00:12:45.957 --> 00:12:49.103]  This new 45-minute film delves deeply into the history...
[00:12:50.226 --> 00:12:56.349]  ...of the grove where powerful men make decisions that affect the world yet remain completely hidden from public scrutiny.
[00:12:56.689 --> 00:13:07.034]  It reveals how the grove has been the backdrop for some of the most earth-shattering events in human history, including the development of the Manhattan Project and the Star Wars program.
[00:13:07.394 --> 00:13:09.495]  The Order of Death features never-before-seen footage.
[00:13:09.915 --> 00:13:17.498]  Take an astonishing and astounding look inside the owl worshipped at the cremation of care ritual captured by a daring former grove employee.
[00:13:17.538 --> 00:13:18.739]  I just remembered I've got to mail him.
[00:13:19.602 --> 00:13:20.022]  One of these.
[00:13:20.042 --> 00:13:22.963]  I told them as soon as we got it, we'd mail it.
[00:13:22.983 --> 00:13:23.883]  We just got them yesterday.
[00:13:24.283 --> 00:13:30.945]  Witness locals engaging in their own rituals in Northern California and much, much, much more.
[00:13:31.446 --> 00:13:36.587]  The history of the elite, how it's controlled, what they do, how to stop them, how to expose them.
[00:13:37.827 --> 00:13:40.868]  Such an important film, The Order of Death.
[00:13:41.068 --> 00:13:41.969]  It's worth the price of $24.95.
[00:13:43.923 --> 00:13:48.586]  But you get Dark Secrets re-edited, remastered, updated, the 2005 version.
[00:13:49.027 --> 00:13:52.349]  Two films on one DVD.
[00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:59.154]  And if you want VHS, we have that too.
[00:14:02.336 --> 00:14:07.560]  But we have it on DVD and VHS, Dark Secrets of Sub-Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death.
[00:14:09.141 --> 00:14:11.243]  And folks, I'm only doing this until January 1st.
[00:14:13.061 --> 00:14:15.543]  Because I want people to get this.
[00:14:15.583 --> 00:14:16.985]  I want you to share this with others.
[00:14:17.445 --> 00:14:22.050]  If you buy one copy for $24.95, each additional copy is $9.95.
[00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:29.176]  So you can buy three or four copies and give this as a gift.
[00:14:29.276 --> 00:14:32.299]  Great color cover, shrink wrap, nice little packaging.
[00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:35.602]  People will love getting this DVD or VHS.
[00:14:37.003 --> 00:14:40.026]  You need to get this new double film.
[00:14:40.146 --> 00:14:42.608]  Two films for the price of one, $24.95.
[00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:46.091]  And then you can just get each additional copy for under $10.
[00:14:48.953 --> 00:14:46.091]  $9.95.
[00:14:49.314 --> 00:14:51.596]  So please get as many of this new film as possible.
[00:14:52.216 --> 00:14:56.019]  Also, there's Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, my best film ever.
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:14:58.121]  And it is three hours long.
[00:14:58.141 --> 00:14:58.982]  It is a mini-series.
[00:14:59.002 --> 00:15:02.545]  It covers the police state, how the globalists carried out 9-11, why they did it.
[00:15:03.271 --> 00:15:04.791]  It totally exposes their program.
[00:15:04.811 --> 00:15:09.532]  Then a whole hour getting into who they are, their philosophy, their driving ideology, what they're trying to do.
[00:15:10.232 --> 00:15:12.313]  We got discounts on that when you get multiple copies.
[00:15:13.453 --> 00:15:16.373]  In fact, across the board, we've gone from t-shirts being $20 to $9.95.
[00:15:16.653 --> 00:15:21.494]  And these t-shirts are made and printed in America.
[00:15:21.514 --> 00:15:22.575]  The shirt's made in America.
[00:15:22.855 --> 00:15:24.155]  They're printed right here in Austin.
[00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:29.996]  And so instead of costing me $2.50, made in Mexico or Nicaragua,
[00:15:32.052 --> 00:15:34.473]  Some of these t-shirts, an extra, extra large, cost me about $6.
[00:15:35.013 --> 00:15:37.834]  A medium cost me about $4.50.
[00:15:38.414 --> 00:15:42.175]  So we're making about, after shipping, we're probably making $3 on these shirts.
[00:15:43.575 --> 00:15:46.636]  My thrill is just getting the information out.
[00:15:48.117 --> 00:15:51.177]  People walking around with Tyranny Response Team InfoWars.com t-shirts.
[00:15:51.478 --> 00:15:53.638]  People walking around with the George Orwell t-shirts.
[00:15:54.738 --> 00:16:00.380]  In an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:03.091]  Pro Second Amendment T-shirts, $9.95.
[00:16:03.452 --> 00:16:06.775]  Infowars.com.
[00:16:07.075 --> 00:16:09.217]  These aren't little flimsy, cheap T-shirts.
[00:16:09.518 --> 00:16:10.719]  These are nice T-shirts.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:12.621]  These are nice T-shirts.
[00:16:13.301 --> 00:16:14.222]  I hope you get those.
[00:16:14.302 --> 00:16:17.686]  And, of course, with every order, we throw in a couple Infowars.com bumper stickers.
[00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:19.447]  So many videos, so many books.
[00:16:20.108 --> 00:16:22.931]  Why not do your shopping at Infowars.com?
[00:16:23.695 --> 00:16:28.718]  Why give somebody some nose hair trimmer or a tie or a fruitcake?
[00:16:29.258 --> 00:16:32.540]  Why give them some piece of junk they're not going to use or want?
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.581]  Why not give them a DVD?
[00:16:35.242 --> 00:16:37.323]  Why not give them a Codex Magicka book?
[00:16:37.623 --> 00:16:42.406]  Why not give them a Innocence Betrayed about the history of people being disarmed and killed?
[00:16:42.666 --> 00:16:46.248]  Give that to your little gun control friend or your cousin who's a gun grabber.
[00:16:47.117 --> 00:16:48.478]  Engage in the InfoWar.
[00:16:48.518 --> 00:16:54.101]  In all of my videos, you're authorized, you're encouraged to make copies for non-profit educational purposes.
[00:16:54.141 --> 00:16:55.121]  Put them on AXS TV.
[00:16:55.462 --> 00:16:56.282]  Please get them out.
[00:16:56.782 --> 00:17:00.444]  We have power to affect, change, and fight the New World Order when you take action.
[00:17:00.885 --> 00:17:01.985]  And I want to commend those that have.
[00:17:02.365 --> 00:17:05.207]  So go to InfoWars.com to order via the Safe Secure Shopping Card.
[00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:06.690]  We're good to go.
[00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.890]  I think?
[00:17:35.899 --> 00:17:36.880]  A monthly is $5.95.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:42.143]  You get, I guess, the equivalent of like, now, five, six months free or something.
[00:17:42.303 --> 00:17:42.703]  I forget.
[00:17:43.784 --> 00:17:46.425]  If you get the yearly subscription, it's all up there at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:17:47.006 --> 00:17:56.191]  All the films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my Whitley TV reports, special video reports, all my best audio interviews, special text reports, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:17:56.671 --> 00:18:04.075]  All right, I have put out that lavish plug, but it's just a great opportunity to wake people up this Christmas season, this holiday season.
[00:18:05.134 --> 00:18:05.434]  Okay.
[00:18:08.095 --> 00:18:09.355]  This is just outrageous.
[00:18:10.355 --> 00:18:11.356]  But we knew it was coming.
[00:18:12.616 --> 00:18:24.539]  The images on Miami television, because I went online and watched some clips, are of police in black helmets, black Darth Vader outfits, black masks in some cases, surrounding people.
[00:18:25.879 --> 00:18:32.761]  They will just randomly go to a shopping center, to a grocery store, to a bank,
[00:18:34.014 --> 00:18:39.455]  And they surround it, and then just start randomly, literally, it's a shakedown.
[00:18:39.516 --> 00:18:40.556]  It's like living in a prison.
[00:18:41.296 --> 00:18:42.916]  Or it's like what they used to do in the poor neighborhoods.
[00:18:42.956 --> 00:18:44.377]  They still do, but they've been tested there.
[00:18:44.677 --> 00:18:46.137]  Just lock down the neighborhood.
[00:18:46.477 --> 00:18:47.858]  All right, everybody come outside.
[00:18:47.878 --> 00:18:48.858]  We're shaking you down.
[00:18:48.878 --> 00:18:49.538]  We're going in.
[00:18:49.558 --> 00:18:53.379]  I mean, Nazi Germany rarely did this.
[00:18:53.899 --> 00:18:57.800]  I mean, this is deepest, darkest Stalin purges.
[00:18:57.900 --> 00:19:00.181]  I mean, this is hell upon earth.
[00:19:01.329 --> 00:19:02.330]  And the border's wide open.
[00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.232]  The illegals are totally being legalized.
[00:19:05.793 --> 00:19:08.295]  Again, all of this has nothing to do with keeping you safe.
[00:19:09.376 --> 00:19:17.863]  And to read this AP article, to just read the statements of the police chief, this is purely for intimidation.
[00:19:17.883 --> 00:19:22.127]  This is purely to let you know, hey, we're the government buster, and we own you.
[00:19:23.064 --> 00:19:35.674]  And again, because they're setting up a system to implode the stock market, to implode the real estate market, to take your pension funds that's all being prepared, finally being talked about in the mainstream, and they know you're not going to like it.
[00:19:36.615 --> 00:19:38.476]  You're not going to like the shearing they're going to get.
[00:19:38.957 --> 00:19:44.641]  And man, they got the cops just trained to just mow us down and kill us and just totally take this country.
[00:19:44.681 --> 00:19:45.222]  And you know what?
[00:19:45.662 --> 00:19:47.384]  We can shove them aside if they really try it.
[00:19:48.464 --> 00:19:50.226]  So just understand that they're a bunch of bullies.
[00:19:51.308 --> 00:19:53.834]  And that they are parasite criminals.
[00:19:53.915 --> 00:19:54.697]  I mean, the globalists.
[00:19:55.218 --> 00:19:56.000]  Not so much the cops.
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.427]  They're just the useless little attack dogs.
[00:19:58.447 --> 00:19:59.009]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.054 --> 00:20:02.414]  We're good to go.
[00:20:23.456 --> 00:20:24.017]  We're good to go.
[00:20:38.593 --> 00:20:38.873]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:04.490]  The war on terrorism.
[00:21:04.811 --> 00:21:07.612]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:07.872 --> 00:21:12.013]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:12.454 --> 00:21:13.294]  So what do you do?
[00:21:13.594 --> 00:21:18.156]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:18.652 --> 00:21:20.773]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:21.273 --> 00:21:35.959]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:35.999 --> 00:21:43.062]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:43.422 --> 00:21:47.826]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.
[00:21:48.266 --> 00:21:50.047]  Order by calling New Millennium today at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:50.067 --> 00:21:50.268]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:22:01.633 --> 00:22:02.174]  We're good to go.
[00:22:28.476 --> 00:22:28.996]  We're good to go.
[00:22:29.016 --> 00:22:29.677]  We're good to go.
[00:23:02.242 --> 00:23:09.110]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:22.184]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobeys, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:23:22.384 --> 00:23:24.166]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:23:24.326 --> 00:23:24.926]  We're good to go.
[00:23:43.553 --> 00:23:45.415]  Zango is what you are looking for.
[00:23:45.555 --> 00:23:50.201]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit mangosteenmarket.com.
[00:23:50.221 --> 00:23:51.923]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N market.com.
[00:23:51.983 --> 00:23:52.524]  Call 888-203-6633 today.
[00:24:06.172 --> 00:24:08.094]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.574 --> 00:24:11.417]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:12.558 --> 00:24:16.242]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:17.203 --> 00:24:20.166]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:24:20.186 --> 00:24:22.468]  Alright, let me just read the AP article and then comment on it.
[00:24:23.649 --> 00:24:26.412]  Miami police take new tack against terror.
[00:24:29.016 --> 00:24:44.600]  Miami police announced Monday they will stage random shows of force at hotels, banks, and other public places, and they did yesterday, to keep terrorists guessing and remind people, you see, there's the truth, to be vigilant.
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.421]  That means to grovel and lick boots of men in Darth Vader outfits.
[00:24:47.441 --> 00:24:48.301]  I mean, this is literal.
[00:24:49.662 --> 00:24:53.543]  Deputy Police Chief Frank Fernandez, the Miami police folks,
[00:24:54.472 --> 00:24:55.853]  You cannot get any more corrupt.
[00:24:56.133 --> 00:25:04.376]  Said officers might, for example, surround a bank building, check the IDs of everyone going in and out, and hand out leaflets about terror threats.
[00:25:04.396 --> 00:25:08.918]  So just secret police scurrying around and cattle on your neighbors.
[00:25:09.418 --> 00:25:15.221]  I've got articles here, folks, where Secure Corps and all these Homeland Security groups, you've got the Neighborhood Watch, you name it,
[00:25:16.036 --> 00:25:22.103]  The army comes in, sets them up, and then, well, there's no real terrorists to fight, so your neighbor's fighting with each other.
[00:25:22.504 --> 00:25:23.725]  You smell marijuana.
[00:25:23.766 --> 00:25:26.289]  See, it's for everything.
[00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.611]  There's no real terrorists, folks.
[00:25:29.773 --> 00:25:30.554]  Continuing here...
[00:25:31.917 --> 00:25:34.118]  This is an in-your-face type of strategy.
[00:25:34.178 --> 00:25:36.280]  It's letting the terrorists know we are out there.
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:39.842]  Fernandez said, oh yes, this will really stop the terrorists.
[00:25:39.862 --> 00:25:48.027]  I mean, when you've got real terrorists, real people, occasionally in the Middle East attacking installations, they will go find the police.
[00:25:48.387 --> 00:25:49.628]  They will go find the troops.
[00:25:50.128 --> 00:25:54.371]  That's exactly what they're looking for, is a concentration of your little boobies.
[00:25:55.451 --> 00:25:55.751]  Okay?
[00:25:55.791 --> 00:25:58.193]  And don't send me an email saying I just said something profane.
[00:25:59.285 --> 00:26:01.648]  Boobies are pirates, folks.
[00:26:02.489 --> 00:26:04.331]  Okay?
[00:26:04.371 --> 00:26:18.407]  Continuing, Police Chief John Kimley said there was no specific credible threat of an imminent terror attack in Miami, but he said the city had repeatedly been mentioned in intelligence reports as a potential target.
[00:26:20.006 --> 00:26:23.427]  The operations will keep the terrorists off guard, Brandis said.
[00:26:23.747 --> 00:26:29.869]  He said Al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups plot attacks by putting places under surveillance and watching for flaws and patterns in security.
[00:26:30.349 --> 00:26:37.291]  Timothy also noted that 14 of the 19 hijackers did part in 9-11 attacks in South Florida.
[00:26:38.111 --> 00:26:44.153]  But uniformed and plainclothes police will ride buses and trains while others will conduct longer-term surveillance operations.
[00:26:44.353 --> 00:26:46.694]  Yeah, political dissidents and media people.
[00:26:46.734 --> 00:26:47.934]  That's been in the news this week.
[00:26:49.273 --> 00:26:51.054]  People are definitely going to notice it, Fernandez said.
[00:26:51.094 --> 00:26:52.294]  We want that shock.
[00:26:52.654 --> 00:26:53.894]  We want that awe.
[00:26:53.914 --> 00:26:57.695]  But at the same time, we don't want people to feel their rights are being threatened.
[00:26:57.735 --> 00:26:58.256]  No!
[00:26:59.936 --> 00:27:02.917]  We need them to be our eyes and our ears.
[00:27:07.098 --> 00:27:08.298]  Now, let's just stop right there.
[00:27:08.338 --> 00:27:12.400]  And they say, oh, this is very similar to what we've done for years to stop criminals at malls and things.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:13.420]  What?! !
[00:27:14.938 --> 00:27:19.301]  Yeah, that's like saying, we've had blacks as slaves for years, so slavery's okay.
[00:27:20.481 --> 00:27:21.662]  And this is not the same.
[00:27:22.643 --> 00:27:29.847]  Folks, can you imagine going to your family into a bank, going into a shopping mall, and there's police in riot gear demanding to see your IDs?
[00:27:30.828 --> 00:27:31.848]  No, I'm not going to give you my ID.
[00:27:31.929 --> 00:27:32.209]  Why?
[00:27:32.229 --> 00:27:33.670]  Because I'm not living in Russia!
[00:27:35.531 --> 00:27:38.212]  Meanwhile, illegal aliens will be going past them left and right.
[00:27:38.272 --> 00:27:39.793]  It's all selectively enforced.
[00:27:39.813 --> 00:27:40.574]  That's been in the news!
[00:27:41.443 --> 00:27:42.183]  Catch and release.
[00:27:42.223 --> 00:27:42.984]  Don't even arrest.
[00:27:43.044 --> 00:27:43.604]  Leave them all alone.
[00:27:43.784 --> 00:27:45.385]  But I'm going to have to put up with this?
[00:27:47.386 --> 00:27:48.126]  It's a joke.
[00:27:48.566 --> 00:27:49.507]  But here's the insane thing.
[00:27:50.167 --> 00:27:54.309]  As if random police searching people is going to stop anything.
[00:27:54.329 --> 00:27:57.110]  And again, what they did in the airports, they're going to do nationwide.
[00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:58.510]  We kept telling you this.
[00:27:59.171 --> 00:28:00.711]  This is happening all over the place.
[00:28:02.492 --> 00:28:08.015]  As if randomly, here and there, setting up a checkpoint that keeps anybody safe.
[00:28:08.095 --> 00:28:08.935]  It does nothing.
[00:28:09.884 --> 00:28:27.254]  This would be the equivalent of somewhere in the United States, there is a person driving a red Volkswagen bus, and we think he might be planning to car bomb, or he might be planning to rob a bank.
[00:28:28.075 --> 00:28:29.996]  And so the police randomly...
[00:28:32.003 --> 00:28:41.825]  Paratrooper out over Albuquerque, New Mexico, and surround a shopping mall or a power plant or a bowling alley, and then search everyone and check their IDs.
[00:28:41.885 --> 00:28:42.866]  It's ridiculous!
[00:28:46.126 --> 00:28:55.749]  And the loyal opposition, totally controlled, totally government ops, meant to lose cases, meant to create bad case law, meant to say there's rights there that don't exist, and then meant to attack rights that do exist.
[00:28:57.049 --> 00:28:59.750]  The ACLU is saying, oh, as long as it's random, it's totally fine.
[00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:01.170]  No, that's even worse!
[00:29:04.301 --> 00:29:06.382]  See, they call probable cause profiling.
[00:29:06.922 --> 00:29:19.148]  Whereas classical profiling is not total probable cause, but it's a lot closer, folks, than just randomly, I'm allowed, Texas Supreme Court says I'm allowed to pull over every third car, because it's random.
[00:29:19.308 --> 00:29:20.108]  That's even worse.
[00:29:20.128 --> 00:29:21.529]  You have zero probable cause.
[00:29:23.815 --> 00:29:35.159]  I mean, it's just, but again, the public's so dumb, they don't even, again, know where Iraq is on a map or what their state capital is on average, or most high school seniors don't know who the vice president is, so they'll just tell them all these lies and they'll believe it.
[00:29:35.319 --> 00:29:36.419]  These cops will believe it.
[00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:38.580]  Look, stop being so stupid.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:40.040]  You're destroying your own country.
[00:29:40.881 --> 00:29:43.862]  Cops in black masks running around randomly searching people?
[00:29:44.202 --> 00:29:45.962]  It's just, they'll do absolutely nothing.
[00:29:46.603 --> 00:29:47.803]  And the government knows that.
[00:29:51.727 --> 00:29:52.629]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.130 --> 00:29:54.734]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.676 --> 00:29:58.342]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.573 --> 00:30:04.934]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:30:05.194 --> 00:30:05.514]  Why?
[00:30:05.534 --> 00:30:08.475]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[00:30:08.555 --> 00:30:13.496]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[00:30:13.636 --> 00:30:23.339]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.

[00:31:01.713 --> 00:31:05.597]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[00:31:05.837 --> 00:31:11.262]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:31:11.542 --> 00:31:21.912]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:31:22.072 --> 00:31:26.416]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:31:26.596 --> 00:31:34.957]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:31:35.237 --> 00:31:41.599]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and fowl taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:31:41.699 --> 00:31:46.179]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:20.700]  We're good to go.
[00:32:42.714 --> 00:32:43.435]  We're good to go.
[00:33:25.411 --> 00:33:30.794]  Jordan Maxwell's coming up in about 26 minutes.
[00:33:31.074 --> 00:33:34.355]  We'll try to jam a few calls in before this hour ends.
[00:33:40.390 --> 00:33:42.211]  This story out of the Associated Press.
[00:33:42.251 --> 00:33:43.271]  Listen to how sick this is.
[00:33:43.311 --> 00:33:43.851]  Now imagine.
[00:33:44.631 --> 00:33:45.712]  Giant gaggles.
[00:33:45.732 --> 00:33:48.012]  We're talking about 50 cops plus at a time.
[00:33:48.593 --> 00:33:50.453]  Swarming, surrounding a building.
[00:33:52.374 --> 00:33:53.514]  Really arresting everyone.
[00:33:53.534 --> 00:33:54.295]  Detaining everyone.
[00:33:55.255 --> 00:33:57.836]  Under precedent and law, that's really an arrest.
[00:33:58.796 --> 00:33:59.496]  You're in custody.
[00:34:00.537 --> 00:34:04.678]  And then demanding IDs and questioning everyone.
[00:34:04.718 --> 00:34:05.998]  I mean, that is Nazi Germany.
[00:34:06.218 --> 00:34:07.219]  But just randomly.
[00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:08.219]  Just randomly.
[00:34:10.063 --> 00:34:12.624]  And then they have this disgusting little quote here.
[00:34:14.004 --> 00:34:16.045]  People are definitely going to notice it, Fernandez said.
[00:34:16.085 --> 00:34:16.986]  We want that shock.
[00:34:17.026 --> 00:34:17.806]  We want that awe.
[00:34:18.326 --> 00:34:21.327]  But at the same time, we don't want people to feel that their rights are being thwarted.
[00:34:21.887 --> 00:34:25.189]  No, no, they're teaching you now that it's your right to not have any rights and to be searched.
[00:34:25.489 --> 00:34:27.109]  We need them to be our eyes and ears.
[00:34:27.229 --> 00:34:30.170]  See, while they're out there, they're going to get lectures and be told what to look for.
[00:34:30.230 --> 00:34:31.371]  It's to create hype and fear.
[00:34:32.271 --> 00:34:34.592]  These thousands of terror attack drills.
[00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:39.231]  All from Michigan to Ohio to Texas.
[00:34:39.751 --> 00:34:42.312]  I mean, every day I read about drills.
[00:34:42.592 --> 00:34:59.301]  They've had drills in Seattle where there's five buses they blow up and helicopters firing flares and black smoke and half the city shut down and people freaking out and they put the images on CNN and all the studies show you then associate that as real.
[00:35:00.562 --> 00:35:02.103]  And all over the country, I've been to these.
[00:35:02.876 --> 00:35:11.160]  They have drills with live fire, and then they'll rent a building covertly and blow it up and terrorize the public and then say, oh, it's just special forces, it's just for your own good.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.821]  Again, desensitizing.
[00:35:14.822 --> 00:35:16.403]  And I've interviewed police chiefs that have said this.
[00:35:16.843 --> 00:35:18.324]  On the record, it is to desensitize.
[00:35:18.584 --> 00:35:21.765]  I've interviewed Thomas Sanchez down in Kingsville, the emergency manager.
[00:35:22.066 --> 00:35:24.567]  They told him this is to get people ready for martial law.
[00:35:25.706 --> 00:35:26.727]  That's why he went public.
[00:35:26.767 --> 00:35:29.331]  He said, I'm a former Marine, Vietnam.
[00:35:29.351 --> 00:35:32.935]  You're not going to call me into a meeting and say this is to train the public for martial law.
[00:35:33.195 --> 00:35:34.577]  I mean, that's what it was for.
[00:35:36.339 --> 00:35:39.463]  Don't forget, the Pensacola News Journal, remember that?
[00:35:40.444 --> 00:35:40.965]  Back in 1998, was it?
[00:35:43.493 --> 00:35:50.255]  The Marines take over Hobbs Middle School, and it was in the paper, and it said, Bill Clinton wants you to, quote, know what martial law is like.
[00:35:50.475 --> 00:35:55.037]  For 30 minutes, the Marines screamed at them and pointed guns, but they were unloaded.
[00:35:55.417 --> 00:35:59.458]  Got the children and said, Bill Clinton wants you to know what martial law is like.
[00:36:02.419 --> 00:36:03.759]  Marines from a local naval base.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:07.560]  Cross my heart, hope to die, stick a needle in my eye, folks.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.281]  You got Lexus Nexus out there.
[00:36:09.421 --> 00:36:11.181]  We got it saved on Infowars.com.
[00:36:11.501 --> 00:36:13.102]  It's in our deep, deep, deep archives.
[00:36:13.914 --> 00:36:14.695]  Going way back.
[00:36:14.715 --> 00:36:19.238]  You can find it on the Google Wayback Machine.
[00:36:19.398 --> 00:36:21.320]  They've got it cached.
[00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:23.902]  There's a reporter listening right now that doesn't believe me.
[00:36:24.102 --> 00:36:25.102]  You've got LexisNexis.
[00:36:25.303 --> 00:36:26.023]  Don't be lazy.
[00:36:26.323 --> 00:36:35.190]  March right into your office right now and just type Hobbs Middle School Marines Martial Law into your LexisNexis and you'll have it.
[00:36:36.271 --> 00:36:37.832]  Stick it in your pipe and smoke it!
[00:36:39.713 --> 00:36:42.935]  Do you understand this is about training you to be a slave?
[00:36:43.255 --> 00:36:43.915]  Period.
[00:36:44.776 --> 00:36:45.356]  Period.
[00:36:45.977 --> 00:36:48.118]  And it makes my blood boil.
[00:36:48.918 --> 00:36:54.701]  I don't want my family, my children, my future grandchildren growing up in a third world cesspit.
[00:36:55.882 --> 00:37:00.785]  Folks, they don't even do random searches like this in some of the worst third world countries out there.
[00:37:00.805 --> 00:37:06.108]  I mean, this is, on the end of the scale, this is way off the edge.
[00:37:07.833 --> 00:37:12.235]  And they've got a degenerate head of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.
[00:37:12.595 --> 00:37:14.496]  You know, most cops, a lot of them really are good.
[00:37:14.516 --> 00:37:17.357]  They had a national poll, what, two years ago?
[00:37:19.258 --> 00:37:24.260]  A big study, and 98% of police don't believe in gun control, believe in the Second Amendment.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.901]  Well, that's cops that actually live in the real world.
[00:37:26.981 --> 00:37:29.462]  But over 90% of chiefs of police do.
[00:37:29.822 --> 00:37:31.503]  Because, again, they're a bunch of political whores.
[00:37:32.464 --> 00:37:33.084]  Mary Ann...
[00:37:33.966 --> 00:37:41.111]  Veverett, president of the International Association of Police, said the Miami program is similar to those used for years during a holiday season.
[00:37:41.912 --> 00:37:42.812]  That's pure baloney.
[00:37:43.513 --> 00:37:44.353]  I've been all over the country.
[00:37:44.373 --> 00:37:47.696]  I've never seen people randomly checking your IDs surrounding banks.
[00:37:47.836 --> 00:37:48.056]  What?
[00:37:48.856 --> 00:37:51.138]  To deter criminals at busy places such as shopping malls.
[00:37:51.558 --> 00:37:59.544]  You want to make your presence known, and that's a great way to do it, said Veverett, police chief in Gaithersburg.
[00:38:00.689 --> 00:38:06.253]  We want people to feel they can go about their normal course of business, but we want them to be aware.
[00:38:06.513 --> 00:38:08.634]  Aware that we're God, basically, what you're saying.
[00:38:11.476 --> 00:38:13.657]  And then Paul Watson wrote this article about it.
[00:38:13.677 --> 00:38:17.900]  I'm not going to read the whole thing, but he really summed it up.
[00:38:20.782 --> 00:38:21.822]  This is outrageous.
[00:38:21.903 --> 00:38:24.084]  I mean, these cops are just... Cops better not...
[00:38:25.214 --> 00:38:28.857]  Come up to, you know, surround where I'm at, and then just, let me see your ID!
[00:38:31.779 --> 00:38:33.020]  I'm the king ape around here.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.240]  Just don't cry it, okay?
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:36.182]  I mean, I'm getting really sick of it.
[00:38:37.142 --> 00:38:39.104]  It's as if this even does anything.
[00:38:39.144 --> 00:38:45.008]  Again, it's like if they have an APB out for a white Volkswagen Beetle.
[00:38:46.361 --> 00:38:52.383]  And instead of having cops look for the license plate number and go off probable cause, which you'll have probable cause, there's an APB out for it.
[00:38:52.783 --> 00:38:53.003]  No.
[00:38:53.704 --> 00:38:58.625]  It would be the equivalent of having troops randomly parachute into the Mojave Desert.
[00:38:59.706 --> 00:39:01.086]  Or into the Chihuahua Desert.
[00:39:01.606 --> 00:39:02.807]  Or into Big Bend, Texas.
[00:39:03.547 --> 00:39:04.888]  Somewhere in the United States.
[00:39:05.428 --> 00:39:06.248]  There's a killer.
[00:39:06.268 --> 00:39:09.669]  And he's kidnapped a little girl.
[00:39:10.130 --> 00:39:11.230]  And he's killed before.
[00:39:12.205 --> 00:39:13.065]  What are we going to do?
[00:39:13.105 --> 00:39:20.348]  We're going to randomly surround a shopping mall, just randomly, and just randomly ask for IDs.
[00:39:21.989 --> 00:39:22.449]  What is that?
[00:39:22.889 --> 00:39:29.892]  Its only use is to train you to have this system-wide in America everywhere.
[00:39:30.452 --> 00:39:32.733]  Well, the FBI called for, quote, remember last year?
[00:39:33.374 --> 00:39:35.334]  Well, we think terrorists might attack shopping malls.
[00:39:35.354 --> 00:39:41.777]  We want you to be searched and scanned and put your stuff through an x-ray machine to get into the mall.
[00:39:43.248 --> 00:39:51.528]  Let's just say there were real terrorists, folks, outside of the CIA and Mossad and Shin Bet and MI6 and a few other groups and FSB, KGB.
[00:39:54.312 --> 00:39:54.873]  They don't care.
[00:39:54.913 --> 00:39:59.837]  They'll just load a truck full of explosives and drive to the front door and kill a bunch of cops while they blow up the shopping mall.
[00:40:00.058 --> 00:40:01.339]  It doesn't protect anybody.
[00:40:01.679 --> 00:40:03.261]  And the government knows this.
[00:40:03.721 --> 00:40:06.844]  This is about, oh, your ID shows your flag and arresting you.
[00:40:07.285 --> 00:40:08.426]  It's about total control.
[00:40:08.446 --> 00:40:09.387]  It's about oppression.
[00:40:09.767 --> 00:40:16.173]  This whole thing is the classical configuration, and their own documents show that's what they're going to do with it, of oppression.
[00:40:17.254 --> 00:40:18.696]  It is attack formation.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:20.201]  On us.
[00:40:20.942 --> 00:40:24.766]  They're in attack formation, attacking us, and I'm sick of it!
[00:40:26.148 --> 00:40:27.129]  I'm going to be frank with you.
[00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:30.113]  More than half of your police chiefs are drug dealers, okay?
[00:40:30.693 --> 00:40:31.494]  Or they're getting cuts.
[00:40:33.597 --> 00:40:35.379]  More than half your sheriffs are drug dealers.
[00:40:35.619 --> 00:40:37.041]  More, well more than half.
[00:40:37.834 --> 00:40:38.294]  We're good to go.
[00:41:02.836 --> 00:41:03.617]  We're just being wrong.
[00:41:03.697 --> 00:41:05.438]  And there's all these well-meaning cops.
[00:41:05.738 --> 00:41:07.160]  I know most of you are good men and women.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.641]  But you're still stupid.
[00:41:08.841 --> 00:41:09.902]  And you're dumb as dirt.
[00:41:10.602 --> 00:41:11.423]  And you know what?
[00:41:12.104 --> 00:41:20.491]  Ignorance of something, ignorance of the law, committing a crime through ignorance or because you're brainwashed, doesn't mean that you get to go scot-free.
[00:41:21.471 --> 00:41:24.354]  Doesn't mean that what you're doing isn't wrong.
[00:41:25.606 --> 00:41:30.850]  So don't tell me about the law, and don't shoot your mouth off about, you know, and play games anymore.
[00:41:30.890 --> 00:41:31.790]  You know it's true.
[00:41:32.051 --> 00:41:35.693]  Right now in your squad car, listening to me, you know it's true.
[00:41:35.713 --> 00:41:38.115]  I don't have to sit here and tell you.
[00:41:38.375 --> 00:41:39.216]  You know.
[00:41:39.996 --> 00:41:42.338]  You know this country's going to hell in a handbasket.
[00:41:43.519 --> 00:41:45.320]  I don't have to even tell you.
[00:41:52.330 --> 00:41:53.250]  And I'm sick of it.
[00:41:53.710 --> 00:41:58.052]  I have mainstream articles here where they're going to make you take microchips to go into the hospital.
[00:41:58.472 --> 00:42:04.674]  I have mainstream articles openly saying you'll have microchips if you want to access TiVo and watch TV.
[00:42:05.134 --> 00:42:06.334]  And then it interfaces with a chip.
[00:42:06.554 --> 00:42:08.075]  And they're going to sell it to the kids as crummy.
[00:42:08.375 --> 00:42:09.235]  Mommy, I want one.
[00:42:09.255 --> 00:42:09.735]  I don't care.
[00:42:10.055 --> 00:42:11.236]  Your mom's just square.
[00:42:11.296 --> 00:42:11.916]  Get the chip.
[00:42:13.316 --> 00:42:14.677]  How did I know five years ago they do that?
[00:42:14.857 --> 00:42:18.558]  Because the Defense Department declassified documents where they said they'd sell it to us this way.
[00:42:18.758 --> 00:42:22.019]  And then I've got the articles right here in front of me where they're doing it.
[00:42:26.054 --> 00:42:26.894]  Help us.
[00:42:27.294 --> 00:42:28.115]  God help us.
[00:42:28.175 --> 00:42:29.275]  This is insane.
[00:42:31.976 --> 00:42:33.116]  Let me read Watson's article.
[00:42:35.196 --> 00:42:37.197]  American police state the frog is cooked.
[00:42:37.217 --> 00:42:42.098]  Miami cops have staged sieges, random check IDs, ride buses and trains.
[00:42:43.758 --> 00:42:44.819]  How do you boil a frog?
[00:42:44.879 --> 00:42:47.819]  You don't throw the frog into a pot of boiling water.
[00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.400]  It would immediately jump out.
[00:42:49.440 --> 00:42:54.101]  You let the frog sit in the warm water and slowly heat the pan until the frog boils to death.
[00:42:54.855 --> 00:42:57.476]  How do you erect the infrastructure of a police state?
[00:42:58.457 --> 00:43:05.900]  You incrementally condition both the police and the public that relinquishing liberty in the name of security is necessary because we live in dangerous times.
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:12.963]  Be sure to make Grandpa remove his shoes at the airport, but let the car go through without inspection every time.
[00:43:13.703 --> 00:43:19.686]  The truth is that the mythical war on terror was never meant to be won and can never be won because it doesn't exist.
[00:43:20.678 --> 00:43:25.480]  The terror, the real terror, is being waged against ordinary people by our own government.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:29.321]  To say we live in a police state is no longer an alarmist cliche.
[00:43:29.681 --> 00:43:38.625]  Perception is clearly and permanently shifted from the police being there to serve the people to the police being there to control and corral and order the people around.
[00:43:38.645 --> 00:43:43.787]  And it goes into what the Associated Press reports today about what's happening in Miami.
[00:43:47.268 --> 00:43:49.109]  And it just goes into what's happening.
[00:43:50.364 --> 00:43:51.185]  It's a long article.
[00:43:51.205 --> 00:43:51.886]  It's a good article.
[00:43:51.906 --> 00:43:53.707]  It deserves to be read.
[00:43:56.349 --> 00:43:57.911]  I'm very frustrated by all of this.
[00:44:00.513 --> 00:44:03.475]  I am infuriated.
[00:44:06.397 --> 00:44:08.759]  And I'm tired of it.
[00:44:12.442 --> 00:44:14.164]  And we don't live in Rome.
[00:44:14.244 --> 00:44:15.505]  We do not live in Nazi Germany.
[00:44:15.525 --> 00:44:16.726]  We do not live in Soviet Russia.
[00:44:20.632 --> 00:44:22.614]  Then I have this.
[00:44:25.236 --> 00:44:32.902]  Every article today is just followed by one travesty and one injustice and one new low after another.
[00:44:32.922 --> 00:44:37.826]  I mean, look at the insulting nature of this CNN headline.
[00:44:38.246 --> 00:44:39.968]  Bush talks tough on immigration.
[00:44:40.668 --> 00:44:42.350]  The average dumbbell reads that.
[00:44:42.370 --> 00:44:43.470]  I'm not trying to be sardonic.
[00:44:43.530 --> 00:44:46.953]  It's just you cannot ever overestimate how stupid people are.
[00:44:47.193 --> 00:44:47.694]  Willfully.
[00:44:48.274 --> 00:44:48.695]  They just...
[00:44:49.893 --> 00:44:50.574]  I like Bush.
[00:44:50.594 --> 00:44:52.475]  Well, this is written to make you feel good about him.
[00:44:53.056 --> 00:44:54.637]  Bush talks tough on immigration.
[00:44:54.677 --> 00:44:55.638]  Well, finally!
[00:44:56.399 --> 00:44:57.820]  Finally he's getting tough.
[00:44:59.422 --> 00:45:02.144]  President says guest worker plan is an amnesty.
[00:45:02.204 --> 00:45:07.268]  I mean, that is the biggest... The plan he proposed three years ago, the plan he proposed a year ago.
[00:45:08.389 --> 00:45:09.350]  I got the plan right here.
[00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:10.091]  You can go read the bill.
[00:45:11.532 --> 00:45:12.293]  Democrats wrote it.
[00:45:12.933 --> 00:45:13.714]  Bush endorses it.
[00:45:14.611 --> 00:45:23.699]  For six years, and it's automatically reauthorized if it's not shot down at that point, anyone who's here, if you can get here, you instantly become legal.
[00:45:24.619 --> 00:45:25.040]  Period.
[00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:26.341]  Period.
[00:45:27.101 --> 00:45:27.622]  Period.
[00:45:28.643 --> 00:45:32.526]  Anyone who can get here or is here is instantly legal for six years.
[00:45:32.906 --> 00:45:35.949]  And it allows the corporations to actually get tax incentives...
[00:45:37.023 --> 00:45:57.940]  The government pays the corporations and companies to bring skilled and unskilled, unlimited skilled visas, unlimited unskilled, actual jets landing daily and ships docking daily, disgorging third world slaves, or slave for Rome, to drive the wages down even further.
[00:45:58.624 --> 00:46:02.487]  I mean, now the new illegal aliens are displacing the old illegal aliens that want five bucks an hour.
[00:46:02.767 --> 00:46:04.989]  The new will work for two bucks an hour and sleep ten to a room.
[00:46:05.029 --> 00:46:07.150]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[00:46:09.892 --> 00:46:11.033]  And I knew it.
[00:46:11.193 --> 00:46:12.934]  I read this yesterday when I got off air.
[00:46:13.495 --> 00:46:15.216]  I saw the story and I said, I know what I'm going to hear.
[00:46:15.656 --> 00:46:22.681]  And driving home, listening to talk radio, last night driving back to the studio to do an interview, listening to this, I heard it, I heard it on talk radio.
[00:46:23.602 --> 00:46:27.485]  The liberals are getting really, they're not going to like this when Bush is getting tough.
[00:46:29.006 --> 00:46:31.426]  USA Radio Network News.
[00:46:32.347 --> 00:46:33.307]  Fox News.
[00:46:33.347 --> 00:46:34.547]  You know, locally you're on the radio.
[00:46:35.127 --> 00:46:35.927]  Listening to the feeds.
[00:46:35.987 --> 00:46:37.868]  And news out of San Antonio.
[00:46:37.908 --> 00:46:39.128]  And I'm flipping channels.
[00:46:39.528 --> 00:46:40.268]  It's the same thing.
[00:46:40.868 --> 00:46:41.568]  George Bush.
[00:46:41.728 --> 00:46:43.109]  Well, finally, he's getting tough!
[00:46:43.929 --> 00:46:45.169]  We've got to do something about this immigration.
[00:46:45.189 --> 00:46:48.550]  Get behind his plan.
[00:46:48.570 --> 00:46:50.870]  And people who form over substance.
[00:46:51.990 --> 00:46:53.630]  Bush talks tough on immigration.
[00:46:54.191 --> 00:46:56.671]  Oh, he's going to get criticized by immigrant groups.
[00:46:58.095 --> 00:47:04.779]  They'll put on a little shill act and, oh, well, the liberal groups are attacking Bush on the bill they wrote.
[00:47:05.399 --> 00:47:07.020]  See how they just play that theater off?
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.041]  We just take it hook, line, and sinker.
[00:47:09.061 --> 00:47:09.942]  I'm so sick of it.
[00:47:11.443 --> 00:47:12.403]  I'm so sick of it.
[00:47:13.504 --> 00:47:14.764]  Do we like being conned?
[00:47:14.784 --> 00:47:15.925]  Do we like being made fun of?
[00:47:15.945 --> 00:47:17.386]  Do we like being laughingstocks?
[00:47:17.406 --> 00:47:18.447]  Do we like being stupid?
[00:47:21.908 --> 00:47:24.450]  Do we like just being incoherent, gibbering idiots?
[00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:26.011]  I mean, do we really like this?
[00:47:30.959 --> 00:47:38.221]  Again, so many people associate their whole worldview with Bill Clinton or Hillary Clinton or George Bush, and they act like there's some fight going on between them.
[00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:41.182]  And these people are government CIA operatives.
[00:47:41.202 --> 00:47:41.943]  They've always been.
[00:47:42.163 --> 00:47:43.023]  It's public knowledge.
[00:47:44.003 --> 00:47:45.124]  Tony Blair's MI6.
[00:47:45.804 --> 00:47:46.804]  Putin's KGB.
[00:47:48.925 --> 00:47:49.245]  Public.
[00:47:49.465 --> 00:47:56.247]  It's just intelligence agencies ruling us, scamming us, feeding on us, and there's never been that for them.
[00:47:57.227 --> 00:47:59.208]  You know, frankly, I've said this on air before.
[00:48:00.370 --> 00:48:04.973]  I'd still fight the corruption, but I wouldn't be so worried about it if I didn't know they were totally psychopathic.
[00:48:04.993 --> 00:48:07.314]  I mean, you expect some corruption and some problems.
[00:48:07.954 --> 00:48:15.519]  But, I mean, this elite is just trying to actually bring society down because they're threatened by you being middle class and educated and happy.
[00:48:15.739 --> 00:48:17.800]  They actually want you to be impoverished and stupid.
[00:48:19.821 --> 00:48:21.462]  They want to hold back human society.
[00:48:21.482 --> 00:48:22.903]  They want to suppress technologies.
[00:48:23.123 --> 00:48:24.044]  They want to suppress.
[00:48:24.084 --> 00:48:26.385]  They have suppressed life-exigent technologies.
[00:48:26.625 --> 00:48:29.387]  So many things that you and I and our children deserve.
[00:48:29.888 --> 00:48:31.649]  So many wondrous things humanity can do.
[00:48:31.809 --> 00:48:33.490]  Being held back by a bunch of criminals.
[00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:34.390]  I'm tired of it!
[00:48:37.673 --> 00:48:39.714]  And I'm tired of police and other people.
[00:48:41.033 --> 00:48:49.756]  Being ignorant of this, and bureaucrats, and people in government, and city managers, and all of you, going along, making excuses, being compartmentalized.
[00:48:50.816 --> 00:48:52.796]  But just don't insult my intelligence with this.
[00:48:52.976 --> 00:48:58.078]  And you know the good news is CNN had a poll right after this big hour-long TV show supporting Bosian, saying how great it was.
[00:48:58.618 --> 00:49:00.038]  He's getting tough.
[00:49:00.058 --> 00:49:05.260]  And they asked them, whereas I printed it off, there were tens of thousands of respondents,
[00:49:06.142 --> 00:49:07.303]  Ninety-eight percent.
[00:49:07.343 --> 00:49:13.006]  The question was, do you believe George Bush has real solutions to the immigration problem and really intends to do something?
[00:49:13.506 --> 00:49:14.146]  That's a paraphrase.
[00:49:14.186 --> 00:49:14.827]  It's here in the stack.
[00:49:14.847 --> 00:49:15.647]  I'll dig it out in a minute.
[00:49:16.187 --> 00:49:17.248]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[00:49:17.328 --> 00:49:18.989]  I also saw it at Rents.com last night.
[00:49:20.950 --> 00:49:25.192]  And two percent believe Bush is sincere and will really do something.
[00:49:25.832 --> 00:49:26.893]  It's not working anymore.
[00:49:28.433 --> 00:49:29.314]  It's not working.
[00:49:30.339 --> 00:49:30.719]  Bubba.
[00:49:31.259 --> 00:49:33.380]  And I mean, you own the Congress, they'll do whatever you say.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:37.322]  90 plus percent don't want new freedom initiative for psychological testing and drugging?
[00:49:37.562 --> 00:49:37.922]  You do it.
[00:49:37.942 --> 00:49:40.303]  90 plus percent don't want national ID cards?
[00:49:40.583 --> 00:49:40.963]  You do it.
[00:49:42.784 --> 00:49:43.984]  I thought this was a free country.
[00:49:44.004 --> 00:49:46.145]  I thought what we want happens.
[00:49:46.605 --> 00:49:49.066]  So stop acting like you speak for the people, government.
[00:49:49.246 --> 00:49:50.266]  You're not our government.
[00:49:51.247 --> 00:49:51.447]  Again.
[00:49:52.398 --> 00:49:55.120]  You're as legitimate as a hijacker that takes over a plane.
[00:49:55.220 --> 00:49:59.082]  Just because you put on the uniform of the captain doesn't make you the captain.
[00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:01.644]  It doesn't mean the air marshals should kneel down and lick your boots.
[00:50:01.684 --> 00:50:02.224]  But you know what?
[00:50:02.484 --> 00:50:03.845]  In this screwed up world, they do.
[00:50:06.126 --> 00:50:06.507]  They do.
[00:50:07.567 --> 00:50:08.808]  I used that analogy last week.
[00:50:09.148 --> 00:50:13.271]  I used that parallel comparison last week, and that's what it is.
[00:50:13.831 --> 00:50:15.392]  Imagine you're two air marshals on a jet.
[00:50:16.327 --> 00:50:26.774]  Somebody hijacks it, he goes into the cockpit, changes into the clothes, and then he releases the pilots and just tells the air marshals, you can keep your guns, I'm now the captain.
[00:50:27.034 --> 00:50:29.176]  And they all go, okay, yes, you're the captain, you're wearing the uniform.
[00:50:32.158 --> 00:50:33.079]  I mean, that's what this is.
[00:50:33.099 --> 00:50:34.179]  This is not our government.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.261]  They're dismantling this country and openly say they are.
[00:50:39.283 --> 00:50:40.904]  Bush talks tough on immigration?
[00:50:41.244 --> 00:50:42.425]  Oh, he's going to get real tough.
[00:50:44.457 --> 00:50:46.199]  That's like saying, we're going to get tough on bank robbers.
[00:50:46.499 --> 00:50:49.462]  We're going to give them the keys and the codes to all the vaults and let them have the money.
[00:50:50.783 --> 00:50:52.105]  Oh man, he's really getting tough.
[00:50:52.705 --> 00:50:54.767]  Don't insult my intelligence anymore.
[00:50:55.028 --> 00:50:56.869]  And don't let them insult your intelligence.
[00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:58.051]  You should be angry.
[00:51:02.768 --> 00:51:05.629]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.889 --> 00:51:07.469]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.809 --> 00:51:12.470]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.810 --> 00:51:17.232]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.672 --> 00:51:21.873]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:22.073 --> 00:51:24.913]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.993 --> 00:51:27.494]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[00:51:27.694 --> 00:51:34.256]  With the roots and history of its orchestrators, Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.516 --> 00:51:41.738]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:51:41.978 --> 00:51:44.398]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[00:52:02.122 --> 00:52:03.723]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:03.863 --> 00:52:07.986]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:52:08.106 --> 00:52:10.988]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:52:11.068 --> 00:52:17.772]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:52:17.972 --> 00:52:20.974]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:52:21.174 --> 00:52:23.556]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:52:23.696 --> 00:52:28.319]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:52:28.339 --> 00:52:29.440]  We're good to go.
[00:52:53.322 --> 00:52:54.223]  888-803-4438.
[00:52:54.283 --> 00:52:55.624]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:52:56.044 --> 00:52:59.927]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:53:03.169 --> 00:53:09.093]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.333 --> 00:53:11.595]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[00:53:18.459 --> 00:53:19.120]  We're good to go.
[00:53:38.712 --> 00:53:39.193]  We're good to go.
[00:54:10.876 --> 00:54:32.627]  You know, I don't think I gave the phone number out, but I'm just not going to take any calls.
[00:54:33.568 --> 00:54:38.310]  We've got a guest coming up, and I've got a lot of news, and I know we've got a bunch of callers, but I just...
[00:54:38.976 --> 00:54:42.798]  There's not time to give you all justice and to get into it, and I've got a bunch of other news.
[00:54:43.458 --> 00:54:49.462]  Later in the broadcast, we'll open the phones up for our guest that's coming up, Mr. Maxwell.
[00:54:51.043 --> 00:55:00.288]  This whole thing, Bush talks tough on immigration, it's just the classic behavior, classic activities.
[00:55:01.528 --> 00:55:06.191]  And the president says, yes, worker plan is an amnesty.
[00:55:07.913 --> 00:55:10.954]  And I guess if he says it in amnesty, it doesn't matter if it is total amnesty.
[00:55:11.014 --> 00:55:11.915]  I mean, we read the plan.
[00:55:11.935 --> 00:55:13.095]  The immigration groups have looked at it.
[00:55:13.636 --> 00:55:14.636]  Total legalization.
[00:55:14.676 --> 00:55:17.297]  I guess there won't be any more illegal aliens because they're just going to legalize them all.
[00:55:18.158 --> 00:55:37.066]  And what they're telling the good old boys in Texas and New Mexico and Arizona and California, they're telling the cops and the corrections people, don't worry, we're about to have a big crime sweep on the illegals and every county's getting $700,000 from ICE, the new federal agency, to start arresting illegal aliens illegally.
[00:55:37.802 --> 00:55:42.205]  But that's illegal aliens, people that have actual fake IDs if they happen to catch you.
[00:55:42.665 --> 00:55:46.448]  And they're going to charge them and put them in one of these private prisons building widgets.
[00:55:46.468 --> 00:55:51.811]  So we'll just compete against the illegal aliens in the prisons where they get 20 cents an hour instead of $5 an hour.
[00:55:51.871 --> 00:55:52.952]  So it'll be even worse.
[00:55:53.352 --> 00:55:58.395]  But anyone who's, quote, undocumented, if you just don't have IDs, you're just going to be left alone.
[00:55:59.316 --> 00:56:01.817]  And that is from inside the system.
[00:56:01.857 --> 00:56:07.161]  That is the big... And they're going to have a raid here of a Walmart, a raid of a...
[00:56:07.998 --> 00:56:14.341]  Of a construction site here, a little raid there, a few hundred here, a few hundred there, of the 40-plus million illegal aliens.
[00:56:14.741 --> 00:56:17.002]  You know, they'll tell you it's 15 million to 20 million.
[00:56:17.042 --> 00:56:19.343]  No, it's more like 40 million now, conservatively.
[00:56:20.403 --> 00:56:22.284]  And that's state numbers put together.
[00:56:24.185 --> 00:56:30.067]  It's very, very, very, very, very, very serious.
[00:56:31.447 --> 00:56:33.208]  And it is ultra-massive.
[00:56:34.008 --> 00:56:34.809]  And it is happening.
[00:56:36.109 --> 00:56:37.550]  It is really, really
[00:56:38.303 --> 00:56:43.929]  Well, no, I haven't spent more money than all presidents before me combined.
[00:57:00.031 --> 00:57:10.774]  I mean, I'm not George Bush, the gun-grabbing, open-border-promoting, UN-joining, UNESCO, New World Order individual who said it's a good policy to have a weak dollar.
[00:57:11.774 --> 00:57:17.496]  I'm not the individual whose whole family is involved in every S&L scam and drug-dealing scam you can imagine.
[00:57:18.456 --> 00:57:20.017]  So, buddy, I'm not the liberal.
[00:57:20.737 --> 00:57:25.238]  Keep using your stupid little terms while the whole country goes down to the black abyss.
[00:57:28.110 --> 00:57:29.391]  And then we read Fox News.
[00:57:29.431 --> 00:57:31.212]  You talk about really being deceptive.
[00:57:33.013 --> 00:57:33.553]  Here it is.
[00:57:33.573 --> 00:57:36.054]  Illegal worker debate heats up.
[00:57:36.655 --> 00:57:37.135]  Heaps up.
[00:57:37.435 --> 00:57:37.895]  Heats up.
[00:57:38.456 --> 00:57:54.084]  Five years after he took office amid much rumbling that he hasn't followed through on his promise to crack down on illegal immigrants, President Bush is now pushing Congress to pass a bill establishing a temporary guest worker program that will help curb the flow of illegal aliens crossing the southern border.
[00:57:57.148 --> 00:58:02.990]  But one thing his program is not, the president stresses, is the dreaded amnesty.
[00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:08.773]  And then it is the word that stops debate about illegal immigration on Capitol Hill.
[00:58:09.153 --> 00:58:10.933]  There's a lot of options on this proposal.
[00:58:11.574 --> 00:58:16.275]  I understand Bush said money during a speech in Tucson, Arizona, one of the states at the forefront of the battle.
[00:58:18.396 --> 00:58:25.139]  But he says we will not be able to effectively enforce our immigration laws until a type of temporary worker program is put in place, he said, which is total legalization.
[00:58:26.756 --> 00:58:27.636]  So, there you go.
[00:58:27.656 --> 00:58:29.897]  All right, we'll start the second hour.
[00:58:29.917 --> 00:58:31.697]  We'll go ahead and get Jordan Maxwell on with us.
[00:58:33.138 --> 00:58:35.438]  We'll talk about who the elite are exactly when we get back.
[00:58:35.919 --> 00:58:37.719]  Infowars.com is the website.
[00:58:41.260 --> 00:58:46.161]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.889 --> 00:58:58.529]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.189 --> 00:59:00.250]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.090]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.731 --> 00:59:03.571]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:05.192]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.872 --> 00:59:09.654]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.054 --> 00:59:14.116]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.910 --> 00:59:27.312]  We're good to go.
[00:59:55.990 --> 00:59:56.651]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:59:56.671 --> 00:59:56.932]  Here it is.
[01:00:09.964 --> 01:00:10.524]  We're good to go.
[01:00:10.584 --> 01:00:11.805]  We're good to go.
[01:00:30.683 --> 01:00:31.384]  We're good to go.
[01:00:50.785 --> 01:00:53.786]  Well, we're doing mighty fine, I do suppose.
[01:01:10.834 --> 01:01:12.555]  We're good to go.
[01:01:30.848 --> 01:01:31.308]  We're good to go.
[01:01:56.061 --> 01:02:20.309]  I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died Believing that we all were on their side Well there's things that never will be right I know And things need changing everywhere you go But till we start to make a move to make a few things right
[01:02:20.589 --> 01:02:21.109]  We're good to go.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.320]  That's right, Johnny Cash.
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:59.903]  And again, when we get back, we'll talk to Jordan Maxwell, get deeply into who the globalists are, who the elites are, who's controlling us, their symbolism, the world they're creating, how they program our subconscious.
[01:03:00.863 --> 01:03:08.565]  You see, these elites had learned these technologies long before they were codified scientifically in marketing and mind control and propaganda.
[01:03:08.825 --> 01:03:13.226]  The mind sciences, as the Nazis called them, or the Russians called them.
[01:03:14.626 --> 01:03:17.467]  Psychological warfare, as the British and the U.S.
[01:03:17.487 --> 01:03:17.787]  call it.
[01:03:20.336 --> 01:03:33.545]  But having knowledge of the propaganda and having knowledge that you're being programmed and knowledge of the programming allows you the power to put it down, to be aware of it, to see through it.
[01:03:33.565 --> 01:03:37.808]  And then it actually becomes an irritant and spurs me on a daily basis to fight these people.
[01:03:38.468 --> 01:03:48.455]  Anytime I'm tired and don't want to fight, I just turn TV on and watch five minutes of news, five minutes of the smirking propaganda, five minutes of the evil elites, and I'm just absolutely ready to go.
[01:03:49.275 --> 01:03:50.096]  I'm going the distance.
[01:03:50.236 --> 01:03:50.816]  What about you?
[01:03:53.598 --> 01:04:00.424]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.744 --> 01:04:02.105]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.305 --> 01:04:04.507]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.647 --> 01:04:06.749]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:11.953]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.293 --> 01:04:16.336]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.576 --> 01:04:17.396]  We're good to go.
[01:04:17.456 --> 01:04:17.776]  I think?

[01:05:52.863 --> 01:05:53.644]  Attention drivers.
[01:05:53.964 --> 01:05:56.505]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[01:05:56.805 --> 01:06:00.087]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[01:06:00.427 --> 01:06:05.289]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents in fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[01:06:05.649 --> 01:06:09.311]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:10.792]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[01:06:11.072 --> 01:06:14.073]  Poor mileage and reduced performance in a time of record fuel crisis.
[01:06:14.394 --> 01:06:15.054]  There is an answer.
[01:06:15.314 --> 01:06:21.457]  Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.

[01:06:45.829 --> 01:06:46.110]  That's 888-873-7371.
[01:06:54.304 --> 01:06:59.927]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:02.508 --> 01:07:10.572]  Well, Jordan Maxwell has been on the scene fighting the New World Order since the early 1960s.
[01:07:12.092 --> 01:07:15.614]  He is an icon in exposing the New World Order.
[01:07:16.405 --> 01:07:18.105]  And we've never interviewed him before.
[01:07:18.485 --> 01:07:20.546]  I've certainly seen some of his documentaries.
[01:07:20.626 --> 01:07:25.127]  I know he's been in some films that have used some of my work in it on Bohemian Grove.
[01:07:25.847 --> 01:07:30.448]  He's just done a lot of great work and we're going to be going to Jordan Maxwell here in just about 60 seconds.
[01:07:31.208 --> 01:07:32.648]  Folks, my new film is out.
[01:07:32.708 --> 01:07:34.529]  The Order of Death.
[01:07:34.769 --> 01:07:36.309]  45 minute documentary.
[01:07:37.329 --> 01:07:43.931]  We had an infiltrator who for the last two years worked in the Grove and
[01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:47.803]  Never even told us about it after he got the footage.
[01:07:47.983 --> 01:07:48.864]  He then gave it to us.
[01:07:49.424 --> 01:07:53.568]  He got inside the owl, got the effigy, the mock human sacrifice.
[01:07:53.588 --> 01:07:57.031]  He's just got so much video and footage.
[01:07:58.032 --> 01:08:02.596]  And that's about 20 minutes or so of the new film.
[01:08:02.616 --> 01:08:09.683]  Then we get into the Illuminati, its history, how the Ku Klux Klan is Illuminati, an offshoot of these Masonic organizations.
[01:08:10.945 --> 01:08:15.067]  It just covers Skull and Bones, The Nexus Points, what their master plan is.
[01:08:15.287 --> 01:08:16.127]  Such an important film.
[01:08:16.347 --> 01:08:23.010]  And it's on the same DVD as my re-edited, re-mastered, re-released Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:08:23.030 --> 01:08:28.872]  Because I made that film in about three weeks back in 2000 because we were getting death threats.
[01:08:28.912 --> 01:08:30.353]  I'd gotten, I'd snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[01:08:30.373 --> 01:08:31.253]  I wanted to do it quickly.
[01:08:32.534 --> 01:08:33.054]  Put it together.
[01:08:33.074 --> 01:08:33.974]  It was a good video.
[01:08:34.034 --> 01:08:34.915]  Powerful information.
[01:08:34.955 --> 01:08:37.616]  But now, I mean, I really tweaked it.
[01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:45.823]  Cut it down, add information to it, brought it up to date, and so it's an hour and 30 minutes long with the new 45-minute film.
[01:08:45.843 --> 01:08:55.088]  That's two hours and 15 minutes of powerful video, two separate films, one DVD, one VHS, $24.95, and each additional copy, $9.95.
[01:08:56.149 --> 01:08:59.671]  And that is only until the first of the year, until January 1st.
[01:09:01.549 --> 01:09:05.431]  It's a great thing to give your friends and family this Christmas season, this holiday season.
[01:09:05.511 --> 01:09:17.875]  It's great to give them a nose hair trimmer that they won't use or don't like, or instead of giving them some stupid book they don't want to read, or instead of giving them a fruit pie or a tie, or some little Christmas ornament.
[01:09:18.812 --> 01:09:20.593]  Give them the gift that unlocks their mind.

[01:09:45.464 --> 01:09:47.686]  A bunch of other documentaries we've been authorized to post.
[01:09:47.786 --> 01:09:50.429]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[01:09:50.829 --> 01:09:52.471]  We have monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:09:52.551 --> 01:09:53.872]  Also make great gifts.

[01:09:59.977 --> 01:10:03.361]  And I'd have to say probably the last day we'll be able to ship these out to you and get it in time for Christmas.
[01:10:03.381 --> 01:10:04.201]  It'll be around the 20th.
[01:10:04.602 --> 01:10:05.402]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:10:05.443 --> 01:10:06.263]  Go ahead and order today.
[01:10:06.283 --> 01:10:09.006]  All right, going to Jordan Maxwell.
[01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:13.973]  First of all, thank you for having me on the program and thank God for people like Alex Jones.
[01:10:36.943 --> 01:10:41.325]  Keeping the spirit of freedom alive and I really appreciate being on the program with you Alex.
[01:10:43.006 --> 01:10:44.047]  I got started back in 1959.
[01:10:45.227 --> 01:10:51.890]  I was very interested in secret societies all of my life.
[01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:56.873]  Even as a kid I was always into all of the occult or hidden
[01:10:59.191 --> 01:10:59.492]  Yes.
[01:10:59.512 --> 01:11:03.073]  I just gravitated toward that even as a child.
[01:11:03.253 --> 01:11:06.954]  I wanted to know the things which are behind the scenes.
[01:11:08.975 --> 01:11:14.576]  Back in 1959, I began studying the secret societies and paternal orders of the world.
[01:11:16.337 --> 01:11:24.599]  It was in 1966 that Anthony Hilder put out his records called The Illuminati with Myron Fagan.
[01:11:26.730 --> 01:11:34.275]  I was a friend of Anthony's and I got that set of records back in 66, mid-66.
[01:11:34.335 --> 01:11:44.200]  I began doing lectures at bookstores and even some of the motion picture studios and people that knew me out here in California.
[01:11:45.241 --> 01:11:55.247]  I began traveling around just talking about Illuminati, Secret Society's Fraternal Orders, and the way that these operations work.
[01:11:55.652 --> 01:11:59.855]  I'm just amazed today the subject of Illuminati is in motion pictures, it's in television.
[01:12:21.349 --> 01:12:23.590]  It's being talked about around the world.
[01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:30.134]  There are all kinds of researchers, but I was doing it back in 1966, some 40 years ago.
[01:12:30.154 --> 01:12:39.700]  I'm just amazed at how the things I was talking about 40 years ago are starting to finally
[01:12:40.313 --> 01:12:42.073]  Come into the public psyche.
[01:12:42.253 --> 01:12:45.074]  Finally, people are beginning to look at it seriously.
[01:12:45.314 --> 01:12:53.056]  Well, just five years ago, Jordan, I was being made fun of because I would talk about skull and bones, and now skull and bones is passe.
[01:12:53.096 --> 01:12:59.677]  I believe at a certain level the New World Order is trying to reveal itself now because the old stonewalling made them lose even more credibility.
[01:12:59.697 --> 01:13:04.418]  They're trying to reveal and put some of their own spin on it, but I want to get your view on that.
[01:13:05.587 --> 01:13:23.839]  In your studies, since 1959, I guess 46 years, in your 46-year studies, if you had two minutes on national TV to boil it down, you're talking to the people, what is the New World Order?
[01:13:24.259 --> 01:13:24.799]  Who are they?
[01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:25.540]  What is their plan?
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:27.381]  Well, I'll tell you.
[01:13:29.362 --> 01:13:33.725]  Golly, that's such a big question.
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:40.485]  And I know that most people hearing me are not going to believe what I would tell you.
[01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:44.688]  But I'm just going to tell you straight out what I think the thing is.
[01:13:44.748 --> 01:13:47.390]  And I'm not the world's foremost authority on anything.
[01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:52.454]  I always try and say that I'm just an ordinary man pursuing extraordinary knowledge.
[01:13:53.014 --> 01:13:54.535]  Because we are all human.
[01:13:54.575 --> 01:13:55.696]  We can all make mistakes.
[01:13:56.216 --> 01:14:00.359]  And so I'm not the world's foremost authority on anything.
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:02.281]  But I've been looking at this subject
[01:14:02.796 --> 01:14:10.559]  For a long time, and I've had a lot of opportunities to talk to people, to other researchers, and I will boil it down to this.
[01:14:11.359 --> 01:14:21.523]  There is a secret agenda that has been formulated probably thousands of years ago for the domination of the world.
[01:14:21.983 --> 01:14:26.185]  And that's why I believe that our problems are not just political.
[01:14:27.389 --> 01:14:29.730]  You are making it very obvious that it's all political.
[01:14:29.890 --> 01:14:32.151]  But I think it's even more than political.
[01:14:32.211 --> 01:14:33.551]  I think it's cosmic.
[01:14:33.611 --> 01:14:45.115]  I think there is a dark force in the universe which wants to destroy the freedom of the creature that God created and gave us our freedom.
[01:14:45.795 --> 01:14:52.397]  And so I see this problem as a cosmic problem or a spiritual problem also.
[01:14:54.028 --> 01:14:57.569]  But I would boil down on the mundane level.
[01:14:58.089 --> 01:15:11.652]  I think the British royalty, the entire concept of the British Empire, is probably the main enemy of America, and we don't even begin to understand it.
[01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:22.015]  When you understand, too, the connections that the Vatican has with the British royalty, you need to remember that for
[01:15:23.288 --> 01:15:28.150]  At least 1,600 years, Europe has dominated the world.
[01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:32.732]  And for 1,600 years, the Vatican has dominated Europe.
[01:15:33.652 --> 01:15:52.059]  And the very idea, the very concept, or the word, New World Order, goes back to a Roman Latin phrase, which was first in a poem by Virgil, the Roman poet,
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.121]  Writing about Caesar.
[01:15:54.801 --> 01:16:02.785]  And in his poem, Aeneas, I believe it was, he talked about a new world order in Latin.
[01:16:03.145 --> 01:16:04.625]  Novus Ordo Siclorum.
[01:16:05.206 --> 01:16:22.073]  And what he meant, he said that when the world will finally come under the Roman heel of Caesar, once Caesar has finally conquered the entire planet, then there would come a Novus Ordo Siclorum.
[01:16:22.614 --> 01:16:50.418]  So I believe, it's just my opinion, but after looking at it for 46 years, I am totally convinced for myself that the Vatican has a hidden agenda in which the British Empire, the British royalty, have thrown in with the secret societies that came out of the Roman Empire and are now in their last and final phase moving on the entire world.
[01:16:51.613 --> 01:16:58.118]  So, if anyone's going to do any research, you might want to go back and look at the British royalty.
[01:16:58.278 --> 01:16:59.119]  Who are they?
[01:16:59.219 --> 01:17:11.208]  The Queen Mum, Prince Charles, and all of that disgusting bunch who have decided that they are going to wipe out all freedom on the face of the earth.
[01:17:12.309 --> 01:17:14.451]  And indeed, they openly said they're going to kill us.
[01:17:14.691 --> 01:17:15.612]  Yeah.
[01:17:16.012 --> 01:17:21.356]  Well, just think about this, and this is putting it in straight language, but just think about if you came out
[01:17:21.872 --> 01:17:33.216]  One night from a restaurant and got in a fight with some guy and you beat him up and everybody pats you on the back that you're the big guy, you beat this guy up because he jumped on you, but you beat him.
[01:17:34.237 --> 01:17:39.619]  And then you find out that he was actually a gang member or a member of a made man in the mafia.
[01:17:40.219 --> 01:17:44.260]  The problem now is that you have just started the problem.
[01:17:44.721 --> 01:17:45.761]  You thought you ended it.
[01:17:45.821 --> 01:17:48.222]  No, now it's really a problem.
[01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:57.716]  And so that's exactly what happened when Americans defeated the British on the field of battle all over the world.
[01:17:57.856 --> 01:18:02.084]  The princes and kings and rulers were looking
[01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.461]  At this thing that was happening in the colonies.
[01:18:05.521 --> 01:18:10.244]  They openly wrote and said, I mean, there's famous quotes that if we let this happen, they're going to take over.
[01:18:10.264 --> 01:18:14.807]  If we let them, you know, have actual money printed by the government instead of by us, it's over.
[01:18:15.027 --> 01:18:16.508]  That's exactly the point.
[01:18:16.748 --> 01:18:22.892]  And so consequently, all their conspirator friends, all of the Illuminati...
[01:18:24.404 --> 01:18:25.425]  Absolutely.
[01:18:25.485 --> 01:18:30.248]  So they all came here and took us over, and now we're the eye of the pyramid.
[01:18:30.288 --> 01:18:32.029]  We'll be right back with Jordan Maxwell, riveting.
[01:18:54.119 --> 01:18:58.562]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[01:18:58.842 --> 01:19:02.425]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[01:19:02.585 --> 01:19:10.711]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[01:19:10.951 --> 01:19:16.595]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[01:19:16.895 --> 01:19:22.118]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[01:19:22.399 --> 01:19:24.480]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[01:19:24.740 --> 01:19:36.888]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[01:19:37.128 --> 01:19:41.554]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[01:19:41.774 --> 01:19:42.715]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:19:42.895 --> 01:19:44.538]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[01:19:44.658 --> 01:19:46.460]  That's FilterMag.com.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:47.181]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[01:19:47.221 --> 01:19:47.401]  That's 800-345-8376.
[01:19:54.227 --> 01:19:57.510]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:57.550 --> 01:20:01.733]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:01.993 --> 01:20:04.775]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:04.975 --> 01:20:07.377]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:07.557 --> 01:20:16.204]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:16.404 --> 01:20:17.745]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:20:17.945 --> 01:20:22.108]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:22.428 --> 01:20:22.808]  We're good.
[01:20:41.437 --> 01:20:42.958]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:42.978 --> 01:20:43.998]  One and the same.
[01:20:44.018 --> 01:20:45.239]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[01:21:07.924 --> 01:21:13.387]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:13.807 --> 01:21:16.928]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:17.208 --> 01:21:19.029]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:19.089 --> 01:21:22.111]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:22.651 --> 01:21:24.872]  Here is reality.
[01:21:25.252 --> 01:21:28.834]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:29.314 --> 01:21:32.976]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:33.536 --> 01:21:36.117]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[01:21:37.717 --> 01:21:38.037]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:38.077 --> 01:21:47.841]  According to a recent report by the National Institute of Health, high blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease and the chief risk factor for stroke and heart failure.
[01:21:48.021 --> 01:21:49.442]  It affects about 50 million Americans.
[01:21:49.502 --> 01:21:52.363]  That's one in four adults.
[01:22:05.987 --> 01:22:06.387]  We're good to go.
[01:22:27.785 --> 01:22:29.686]  ...to start protecting yourself from the silent killer.
[01:22:29.706 --> 01:22:29.966]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:22:54.745 --> 01:22:59.888]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:23:00.569 --> 01:23:02.950]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:18.320]  Welcome back.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:20.522]  I'm talking to Jordan Maxwell.
[01:23:21.821 --> 01:23:23.722]  Woke up to the New World Order back in 59.
[01:23:24.323 --> 01:23:26.304]  Really got involved in the fight in the mid-60s.
[01:23:28.265 --> 01:23:30.446]  And Jordan, before we go any further, this is a short segment.
[01:23:30.786 --> 01:23:32.007]  Tell people about your website.
[01:23:32.748 --> 01:23:33.348]  Yes, okay.
[01:23:33.368 --> 01:23:37.730]  It's jordanmaxwell.com Simple.
[01:23:37.811 --> 01:23:39.051]  Jordan is like the river.
[01:23:39.171 --> 01:23:48.837]  J-O-R-D-A-N maxwell.com And go on there to check out my resume, press kit, and all the things I've done.
[01:23:49.037 --> 01:23:49.978]  And then also...
[01:23:50.894 --> 01:23:54.156]  On the articles, I've got a lot of different articles and banners.
[01:23:54.236 --> 01:24:02.360]  I've got a lot of different terms and words and phrases and questions about things which are going on in the world.
[01:24:03.201 --> 01:24:09.644]  So you'll have to see a lot of what I do because it's very difficult to translate it into words.
[01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:17.729]  But when you begin to see the symbols and the emblems and where they keep popping up, and I guess what I have been able to do
[01:24:18.433 --> 01:24:18.794]  We're good to go.
[01:24:18.814 --> 01:24:19.054]  I think?
[01:24:36.588 --> 01:24:40.611]  All-encompassing agenda being worked out.
[01:24:40.631 --> 01:24:41.672]  Well, here's an example.
[01:24:42.212 --> 01:24:46.475]  My wife yesterday walked into the office and said, Hey, honey, here's a Starbucks coffee.
[01:24:47.095 --> 01:24:48.416]  She'd been to Starbucks, brought me one.
[01:24:48.876 --> 01:24:54.220]  And both the people stringing up Christmas tree lights on the red cup are doing the Diablo.
[01:24:54.964 --> 01:24:55.705]  Oh, yes.
[01:24:55.845 --> 01:25:01.428]  And you see the all-seeing eye, the triple six, everywhere.
[01:25:01.468 --> 01:25:02.949]  They're totally obsessed with it.
[01:25:02.989 --> 01:25:07.491]  Then you read about these execs are all into shamanism, the occult.
[01:25:07.511 --> 01:25:10.053]  They're all members of weird organizations.
[01:25:10.473 --> 01:25:13.174]  I mean, it always just goes back to the same thing.
[01:25:13.194 --> 01:25:14.595]  And people say, well, which group is it?
[01:25:14.615 --> 01:25:16.976]  Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, Bilderberg?
[01:25:17.057 --> 01:25:17.817]  Are they political?
[01:25:17.897 --> 01:25:18.617]  Are they occultic?
[01:25:18.938 --> 01:25:19.438]  I mean, literally...
[01:25:19.858 --> 01:25:22.339]  They're all just chapters of the same organization, aren't they?
[01:25:22.359 --> 01:25:23.160]  That's exactly right.
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:25.261]  They're just chapters of the same thing.
[01:25:25.341 --> 01:25:26.942]  It's all one operation.
[01:25:28.823 --> 01:25:39.549]  In 1967, I was over in Glendale, California, doing some research in the Glendale Library, and that was a watershed for me.
[01:25:39.609 --> 01:25:41.990]  That was a major, major thing that happened.
[01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:45.352]  I was looking through the World Book Encyclopedia, and
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:47.721]  We're talking 67.
[01:25:48.101 --> 01:25:56.188]  Well, since 59 I have been reading and studying a lot about Nazi philosophy, communist theology, communist philosophy, etc.
[01:25:56.748 --> 01:26:02.413]  And the secret societies and paternal orders and the terms and things which they use.
[01:26:02.833 --> 01:26:13.262]  But it was not until 67 in Glendale that I happened upon the World Book Encyclopedia under, and I was looking under Russia or the Soviet Union,
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:20.865]  And on the Soviet Union, they had a picture of the flag of the Soviet Union and then the National Coat of Arms.
[01:26:21.986 --> 01:26:24.127]  And I read the article.
[01:26:24.147 --> 01:26:31.913]  It was just about four or five sentences telling you what these symbols on the coat of arms of the Soviet Union meant.
[01:26:32.593 --> 01:26:33.694]  And it knocked me out.
[01:26:33.754 --> 01:26:35.375]  It was as if a brick hit me.
[01:26:35.496 --> 01:26:36.396]  I couldn't believe it.
[01:26:37.217 --> 01:26:42.841]  I finally understood that one of the most powerful symbols the Illuminati has ever used
[01:26:43.579 --> 01:26:52.281]  And it finally occurred to me what it was I have been looking at for a long time and did not understand.
[01:26:52.301 --> 01:26:57.082]  And it's a very powerful symbol and it is everywhere.
[01:26:57.582 --> 01:27:00.962]  All the presidents of the United States have used the same terms.
[01:27:01.622 --> 01:27:04.443]  All the senators, congressmen use the same terms.
[01:27:05.003 --> 01:27:07.104]  Corporations use the same terms.
[01:27:07.304 --> 01:27:09.544]  All of the different governments throughout the world
[01:27:09.946 --> 01:27:15.487]  Paternal orders all use the same words and terms and symbols.
[01:27:15.987 --> 01:27:22.509]  And once you begin to see it, then you say, my God, this is long and old and far back.
[01:27:22.809 --> 01:27:28.610]  This stuff is going all the way back into the primeval times.
[01:27:28.690 --> 01:27:35.392]  I mean, all of these symbols coming out of Egypt and Sumeria, Babylonia, Phoenicia, Cana,
[01:27:36.084 --> 01:27:46.512]  And now they are everywhere in our society and the people, especially Christians, should be well aware of all of this and even they don't see these things.
[01:27:47.212 --> 01:28:02.403]  But there was one in particular and that was the sun rising over the mountains and immediately when it said that the sun represents the dawning of a new day for the new order of a world, a new order of the world which was coming.
[01:28:03.004 --> 01:28:08.647]  Well, as I said, I saw this in Nazism, I've seen it in Communism, Fascism.
[01:28:09.428 --> 01:28:16.372]  I have watched this word and the terms and the symbols being used and it really excited me because now I've got something.
[01:28:17.172 --> 01:28:17.693]  Now I have it.
[01:28:17.753 --> 01:28:21.575]  And then suddenly you look at the Congress Hall and there are the symbols right there.
[01:28:21.595 --> 01:28:22.716]  Right in front of you.
[01:28:22.956 --> 01:28:23.496]  Right in front.
[01:28:23.516 --> 01:28:24.577]  Stay there, Jordan Maxwell.
[01:28:24.617 --> 01:28:26.518]  They are everywhere, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:27.606 --> 01:28:36.834]  And it's so prolific, a lot of us end up following the symbols, using the symbols, and playing our part in it unwittingly.
[01:28:37.535 --> 01:28:39.036]  It's subconscious programming.
[01:28:39.076 --> 01:28:40.758]  We'll be right back with Jordan Maxwell.
[01:28:40.778 --> 01:28:41.218]  Stay with us.
[01:28:54.432 --> 01:29:00.793]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:01.013 --> 01:29:06.035]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.355 --> 01:29:14.256]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.396 --> 01:29:21.438]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:21.678 --> 01:29:22.880]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:23.040 --> 01:29:26.424]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:26.484 --> 01:29:29.167]  Don't just treat symptoms, eliminate the cause.

[01:30:59.012 --> 01:31:01.654]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:31:02.139 --> 01:31:04.781]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[01:31:56.394 --> 01:32:16.166]  JordanMaxwell.com Jordan continuing.
[01:32:16.226 --> 01:32:19.908]  Oh, by the way, in the next hour, folks, we will open the phones up so you can talk to Jordan Maxwell.
[01:32:22.575 --> 01:32:39.217]  Jordan, let's get into tracking it back to Babylon, back to Egypt, back to the first sciences of propaganda, controlling populations, teaching the population that the government is your god, and that you're a slave, and that it's wonderful to be a slave, and then we have the
[01:32:39.697 --> 01:32:40.778]  We're good to go.
[01:33:08.795 --> 01:33:19.280]  The research you've done on the beginnings of the Illuminati and exactly who they are, and then let's run up to modern times and talk about what their final goal is.
[01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.201]  Once they get their one world government, what are they planning to do?
[01:33:22.761 --> 01:33:28.424]  Well, you know, I think that there is a hidden story here.
[01:33:29.424 --> 01:33:32.986]  The Bible talks about the angels and sons of God and
[01:33:33.499 --> 01:33:44.028]  The Watchers, and it implies both in all three religions, both in Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, talk about the presence of other world entities.
[01:33:44.048 --> 01:33:45.990]  Well, I'm totally convinced that that's true.
[01:33:46.110 --> 01:33:57.080]  There's no doubt in my mind that this earth is being visited or is in the hands of, so to speak, foreign entities, not from here.
[01:33:57.180 --> 01:34:00.443]  I don't believe that this much badness and evil exists.
[01:34:01.765 --> 01:34:06.526]  Can come from the mind of men because it's too well put together.
[01:34:06.546 --> 01:34:07.746]  It's too well oiled.
[01:34:07.766 --> 01:34:09.667]  It's been around for too, too long.
[01:34:09.687 --> 01:34:23.890]  I mean, you can't get grown men to agree on much of anything, but this fantastic system of usury and manipulation and slavery has been going on for thousands and thousands of years.
[01:34:26.026 --> 01:34:28.169]  And we read about it in the Bible.
[01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:30.911]  We're given prophecies about the time of the end.
[01:34:32.032 --> 01:34:39.380]  So we know that this earth is in the hands of some very dark powers and that's why it's in the beginning.
[01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:42.303]  I don't see it as necessarily just political.
[01:34:42.823 --> 01:34:44.425]  It's cosmic in proportion.
[01:34:46.838 --> 01:34:48.799]  Well, let me say this for those that don't believe that.
[01:34:48.819 --> 01:34:54.363]  Whether you believe in God or not, and I do, and I know Jordan does, you have to understand, the elite, it's not debatable.
[01:34:54.543 --> 01:34:58.386]  They do believe in it, and they believe they're serving the dark powers.
[01:34:58.766 --> 01:35:08.132]  They believe that being raw and hateful and abusive is somehow virtuous and is some type of weird social Darwinistic view.
[01:35:08.152 --> 01:35:11.675]  So again, atheists listening right now, you're like, oh, I refuse to hear that.
[01:35:12.235 --> 01:35:12.916]  I don't believe that.
[01:35:13.376 --> 01:35:16.338]  It doesn't matter if you believe in God or not in this debate.
[01:35:16.958 --> 01:35:20.141]  Understand, the elite are governed by this.
[01:35:20.241 --> 01:35:21.602]  They are obsessed with it.
[01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:23.023]  That's exactly right.
[01:35:23.083 --> 01:35:27.727]  They are a very, very devout religious group.
[01:35:28.928 --> 01:35:30.950]  They have a very powerful religion.
[01:35:32.791 --> 01:35:37.835]  And when you talk about... Let's talk about that for a moment, the religion of the Illuminati.
[01:35:38.275 --> 01:35:40.617]  When you talk about the Bohemian Grove...
[01:35:43.107 --> 01:35:46.869]  There's something more to the Bohemian Grove than most people know.
[01:35:47.609 --> 01:35:50.290]  And this is probably new even to you, Alex.
[01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:52.751]  The very word grove.
[01:35:53.451 --> 01:35:55.352]  The very word grove.
[01:35:56.704 --> 01:35:59.686]  It's connected to the ancient world.
[01:36:00.226 --> 01:36:01.167]  It's in the Bible.
[01:36:01.207 --> 01:36:06.250]  Well, it's a conclave of groups or covens meeting.
[01:36:06.270 --> 01:36:07.370]  It's like a grand convention.
[01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:08.010]  That's right.
[01:36:08.451 --> 01:36:16.055]  It was even in the book of Genesis talking about the grove worshippers, or those who would meet in secret in the grove.
[01:36:16.955 --> 01:36:25.500]  And the very word grove, when you trace it in the Bible, the word in the ancient Phoenician language,
[01:36:26.493 --> 01:36:28.595]  For grove was a phallic.
[01:36:28.875 --> 01:36:33.918]  The human phallic, the male phallic, was referred to as the grove or a grove.
[01:36:33.958 --> 01:36:36.640]  And that's why the tree is so important.
[01:36:36.660 --> 01:36:38.381]  That's why you have a family tree.
[01:36:39.662 --> 01:36:40.103]  Obelisk.
[01:36:40.183 --> 01:36:42.124]  Yeah, it's the obelisk.
[01:36:42.264 --> 01:36:46.847]  As a matter of fact, the Washington Monument is a male phallic.
[01:36:46.927 --> 01:36:50.250]  It connects with the female ovaries or the oval office.
[01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:55.213]  And when you begin to break down the words and the terms and symbols,
[01:36:55.802 --> 01:37:01.283]  You begin to see this is a very ancient stuff that's been going on for thousands of years.
[01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:12.086]  And the Bible has Jesus saying, Many will look with their eyes, but not see, listen with their ears, but not hear, and with their heart not get the sense of it.
[01:37:12.726 --> 01:37:20.728]  And so many people who think that they're sophisticated and well-informed are looking at something which is at least 5,000 years old,
[01:37:22.486 --> 01:37:25.852]  And they haven't got the faintest idea what these symbols mean.
[01:37:26.497 --> 01:37:30.739]  Or how we're being played, and it's an extraordinarily frightening story.
[01:37:30.779 --> 01:37:37.663]  Now, it's part of the religion, though, that having their symbols out in plain view gives them the power, working the magic in plain view.
[01:37:37.843 --> 01:37:40.124]  I mean, you go in Starbucks, folks, it's obvious.
[01:37:40.224 --> 01:37:46.607]  Everything's pyramids, all-seeing eyes, pentagrams, goddesses, and people doing Diablo signs.
[01:37:46.927 --> 01:37:49.969]  Why do they need to constantly throw that in our face?
[01:37:50.209 --> 01:37:52.690]  Well, I think it shows ownership.
[01:37:53.777 --> 01:37:55.939]  I've talked about this a long time ago.
[01:37:55.999 --> 01:37:57.740]  A brand or a mark?
[01:37:58.100 --> 01:37:58.560]  Exactly.
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:01.522]  It's like a mark and a brand that shows ownership.
[01:38:02.583 --> 01:38:13.289]  It's like the kids in gangs will spray graffiti on the wall and all the people driving by will just be disgusted if it's messing up the wall.
[01:38:13.349 --> 01:38:13.809]  But no.
[01:38:14.329 --> 01:38:16.871]  You need to know how to read those symbols.
[01:38:16.931 --> 01:38:18.412]  They mean something too.
[01:38:20.137 --> 01:38:29.764]  The group that comes out late at night when all the people are sleeping, the gangs are roaming like animals, and they understand what those symbols mean.
[01:38:30.424 --> 01:38:41.392]  And so when you're seeing these emblems and symbols and corporate logos and National Coast of Arms and Howler Tree and all around you, they mean something.
[01:38:41.492 --> 01:38:44.555]  They are representing the ownership.
[01:38:44.695 --> 01:38:45.896]  They're representing...
[01:38:47.715 --> 01:38:49.696]  Who they are being financed by.
[01:38:49.716 --> 01:38:52.618]  It's an extraordinary story.
[01:38:53.179 --> 01:38:57.982]  As I said, the more you look into this, the more convinced you will become.
[01:38:58.422 --> 01:39:00.924]  This is a very ancient operation.
[01:39:00.984 --> 01:39:03.486]  This thing has been going on for thousands of years.
[01:39:04.207 --> 01:39:07.369]  There's been a war between light and darkness from day one.
[01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:11.792]  I think that we are really losing big time.
[01:39:12.453 --> 01:39:14.414]  America, as far as I'm concerned,
[01:39:15.058 --> 01:39:27.670]  It's the last great hope of the world, because when America goes under, it's the most powerful nation in the world, and consequently, it's going to take down the entire world.
[01:39:27.730 --> 01:39:33.475]  It's already been seized as a war mock, an engine to knock down the walls of any other free people.
[01:39:33.575 --> 01:39:34.336]  Yeah, that's it.
[01:39:34.596 --> 01:39:40.662]  And I'm frightened at the implications, what that means for children, what that means for human families.
[01:39:42.205 --> 01:39:50.729]  If you go on my website, like I said, and just go to the articles and look at some of the stuff I have there on the banners.
[01:39:51.609 --> 01:39:58.692]  I've done a lot of videos and DVDs on the subject of words and terms and symbols.
[01:39:59.012 --> 01:40:06.915]  When you start breaking down the words, there is a whole magical world there that most people are totally unaware of.
[01:40:07.135 --> 01:40:09.716]  You think that you understand what words mean.
[01:40:10.598 --> 01:40:11.959]  Well, here's an example.
[01:40:11.979 --> 01:40:13.260]  We have switched over from common law...
[01:40:33.724 --> 01:40:43.887]  In low sex, in a mosaic law, to the Roman civil law, and any good lawyer, most of the dumb ones don't even know this, but real lawyers go, oh, absolutely, it is a ritual.
[01:40:44.307 --> 01:40:45.968]  You've got to say it right, do it right.
[01:40:46.808 --> 01:40:48.408]  The courthouse is built like a temple.
[01:40:48.728 --> 01:40:50.369]  The judge is in ceremonial robes.
[01:40:50.409 --> 01:40:57.071]  He's above you, normally with a big triangle wedge behind him as a symbol, and his coat of arms.
[01:40:57.511 --> 01:41:00.352]  You have to then address him, and you pray to the court.
[01:41:00.772 --> 01:41:03.294]  You pray to the judge in your pleadings.
[01:41:03.654 --> 01:41:05.315]  We pray to this court.
[01:41:05.775 --> 01:41:09.297]  And it all has to be done properly as a ritual.
[01:41:09.878 --> 01:41:15.121]  And it's not even so much about what your pleadings are on the surface.
[01:41:15.201 --> 01:41:18.183]  It's how the ritual is conducted.
[01:41:18.363 --> 01:41:21.925]  But even more importantly, it's the connections of the lawyer.
[01:41:22.285 --> 01:41:23.986]  What group is he a member of?
[01:41:24.166 --> 01:41:26.508]  Well, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[01:41:26.588 --> 01:41:27.528]  You said it so well.
[01:41:27.568 --> 01:41:28.489]  That's the point.
[01:41:29.019 --> 01:41:33.301]  It is a whole ritualistic thing going on.
[01:41:33.321 --> 01:41:36.662]  Let me run this by you.
[01:41:36.722 --> 01:41:38.623]  There are only two things on this earth.
[01:41:38.663 --> 01:41:40.623]  There's land and water.
[01:41:41.203 --> 01:41:44.305]  So there are only two basic kinds of law on the earth.
[01:41:44.345 --> 01:41:47.546]  The law of the land and the law of water.
[01:41:48.186 --> 01:41:53.388]  And once you understand that the law of the land is the law of the people who live on a particular plot of land,
[01:41:54.895 --> 01:41:58.017]  You find that the law of the land is different in every country.
[01:41:58.478 --> 01:42:05.762]  And the Illuminati loves the law of the sea because it's the law of the pirate, hence skull and bones, piracy, exactly.
[01:42:06.543 --> 01:42:13.207]  And so consequently, the law of the sea is referred to as maritime law.
[01:42:13.787 --> 01:42:17.150]  And maritime law is the law of the high seas, the law of water, or...
[01:42:18.343 --> 01:42:24.707]  As any well-informed attorney will tell you, maritime law is the law of money.
[01:42:25.587 --> 01:42:30.150]  And because it's the cash flow, the liquid asset, it's the cash flow.
[01:42:30.610 --> 01:42:33.492]  And so the law of the high seas is the law of money.
[01:42:33.592 --> 01:42:34.433]  It's banking.
[01:42:35.053 --> 01:42:37.635]  So when you go into court, why do you have to go to court?
[01:42:38.115 --> 01:42:39.516]  You play tennis on a court.
[01:42:39.636 --> 01:42:41.097]  How do you play tennis on a court?
[01:42:41.357 --> 01:42:42.357]  You play with a racket.
[01:42:42.778 --> 01:42:45.719]  When you start looking at the words and the terms which are used...
[01:42:47.632 --> 01:42:55.434]  It's just beyond belief how well this thing has all been put together and we buy into it.
[01:42:55.494 --> 01:43:07.678]  I mean, when you walk into a court and the judge sits high up so he can look down on you and you can look up to the law and he rules on the bench.
[01:43:07.718 --> 01:43:10.238]  We say that the judge rules on the bench.
[01:43:10.738 --> 01:43:12.519]  The word bench is a Latin word.
[01:43:12.619 --> 01:43:14.219]  Look it up in a Latin dictionary.
[01:43:14.239 --> 01:43:16.700]  The Latin word bench means a bank.
[01:43:17.657 --> 01:43:18.678]  Where do you find a bank?
[01:43:18.738 --> 01:43:20.860]  You find banks on both sides of a river.
[01:43:21.081 --> 01:43:22.062]  They're called river banks.
[01:43:22.722 --> 01:43:24.304]  What does a river bank do?
[01:43:24.464 --> 01:43:27.127]  Well, it directs the flow of the currency.
[01:43:27.768 --> 01:43:29.750]  Your money is cash flow.
[01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:31.912]  It's liquid assets.
[01:43:32.452 --> 01:43:38.519]  You are referred to as a maritime admiralty product because you came out of your mother's water.
[01:43:38.539 --> 01:43:39.900]  Her water broke.
[01:43:40.385 --> 01:43:44.927]  And once you came out into life, you were a maritime admiralty product.
[01:43:45.227 --> 01:43:46.968]  And now they're shifting us further into this.
[01:43:47.248 --> 01:43:52.531]  No longer are you called employee or someone who works there, a laborer.
[01:43:52.591 --> 01:44:00.335]  No, now it is you are the... Yeah, you are, what is it they call it, a human asset or a human...
[01:44:01.714 --> 01:44:03.356]  There's a term that they're giving it now.
[01:44:03.556 --> 01:44:05.377]  For some reason, it's escaping me.
[01:44:06.798 --> 01:44:08.960]  But it's that department now.
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:11.581]  You have the person who's over the employees.
[01:44:12.282 --> 01:44:14.303]  They're called... It's driving me crazy.
[01:44:14.323 --> 01:44:14.944]  I know, I know.
[01:44:15.004 --> 01:44:17.226]  It's human something.
[01:44:17.286 --> 01:44:19.147]  I can't remember what it is right now either.
[01:44:20.488 --> 01:44:21.349]  Human resource.
[01:44:21.389 --> 01:44:22.449]  Yeah, human resource.
[01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:23.130]  That's what it is.
[01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:26.032]  And of course, like iron and rubber and...
[01:44:26.568 --> 01:44:28.590]  And gasoline and you.
[01:44:28.770 --> 01:44:29.851]  You're a human resource.
[01:44:29.911 --> 01:44:31.132]  They even quantify it.
[01:44:33.213 --> 01:44:35.595]  You know, and that's why you're called a G.I.
[01:44:36.596 --> 01:44:39.318]  In the military, you're called a G.I., a government issue.
[01:44:40.119 --> 01:44:48.105]  Well, the government issues gas cans and tires and underwear and guns and everything else that the government issues.
[01:44:48.706 --> 01:44:55.571]  And so that's why they don't mind leaving Americans in concentration camps and leaving them
[01:44:56.724 --> 01:45:00.026]  To die on a foreign land because they are a G.I.
[01:45:00.366 --> 01:45:02.827]  But that's also at a higher level part of the sacrifice.
[01:45:02.847 --> 01:45:11.551]  The Illuminati, and Jordan Crickman is wrong, at least alludes themselves into, well, we have to keep balance in this whole force system.
[01:45:11.611 --> 01:45:16.393]  And so if we kill a bunch of Iraqis, our men have to die, even if they don't die in battle.
[01:45:16.433 --> 01:45:19.515]  So it's okay if they die from shots or die from D.U.
[01:45:19.835 --> 01:45:22.316]  because actually the gods demand that sacrifice.
[01:45:22.596 --> 01:45:24.497]  Well, I'm sure there is something to that.
[01:45:25.217 --> 01:45:34.164]  You know, I've talked a lot about, and a lot of people that are hearing me who know me know that I've talked about this many times, but I'm bringing it up again because it's so important.
[01:45:34.545 --> 01:45:43.572]  The planet Saturn, the god, the ancient god Saturn, plays a very profound part in what's going on today throughout the world.
[01:45:44.052 --> 01:45:46.554]  Saturn was the god of the black robe.
[01:45:47.055 --> 01:45:51.999]  This is why judges wear black robes and priests wear black robes and Darth Vader and
[01:45:52.751 --> 01:45:56.153]  And Dracula and everybody else wears black robes.
[01:45:56.393 --> 01:45:57.413]  What, James?
[01:45:57.453 --> 01:45:58.514]  The new riot police?
[01:45:58.574 --> 01:45:59.814]  Yeah.
[01:46:00.034 --> 01:46:02.956]  Saturn is referred to as the god of the black robe.
[01:46:02.996 --> 01:46:08.678]  Another term given to Saturn was he's the lord of the rings.
[01:46:09.638 --> 01:46:12.940]  And, of course, the Saturnian rings.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:21.524]  There were celebrations in the Roman Empire in December called the Saturnalia, where they actually celebrated the end of the world.
[01:46:21.584 --> 01:46:22.064]  They called it
[01:46:22.495 --> 01:46:24.677]  The Saturnalian Festival.
[01:46:25.477 --> 01:46:31.241]  Today we refer to the celebrations in America like Mardi Gras.
[01:46:31.601 --> 01:46:36.305]  Also, they had the little ring they'd wear on their head, too.
[01:46:36.425 --> 01:46:36.845]  Of course.
[01:46:36.965 --> 01:46:49.154]  In Mardi Gras, in New Orleans, in Brazil, the big completion of the Feast of Mardi Gras is the King Saturn is unveiled.
[01:46:49.234 --> 01:46:51.035]  He's referred to as King Saturn.
[01:46:51.627 --> 01:46:52.987]  And they have a carnival.
[01:46:53.608 --> 01:46:57.008]  And carnival comes from carnivorous, the eating of human flesh.
[01:46:57.128 --> 01:46:58.869]  The eating of flesh, carnival.
[01:46:59.669 --> 01:47:09.111]  And the destruction of the old order in preparation for Sunday when the new sun will rise on the new day and the new dawn for the world.
[01:47:09.612 --> 01:47:15.153]  So the whole idea is to destroy the old world order in preparation for a coming
[01:47:15.772 --> 01:47:17.193]  New order of the world.
[01:47:17.273 --> 01:47:25.219]  By the way, I was looking online at a website that had pictures of somebody who had been on a carnival cruise, and all over this ship was this horned god eating people.
[01:47:25.560 --> 01:47:25.740]  Yeah.
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:28.142]  Well, what am I telling you?
[01:47:28.462 --> 01:47:36.108]  I'm telling you that the planet Saturn is very important to the secret societies and fraternal orders.
[01:47:37.369 --> 01:47:45.295]  And if you go back into the founding of this country, what the symbols meant and how they were being put together,
[01:47:46.345 --> 01:47:55.249]  It's very difficult to talk about this kind of subject in the short period that we have together because there's so much that could be said about this.
[01:47:55.709 --> 01:48:01.491]  I've tried to do as much as I can, given my resources, because I'm not a businessman.
[01:48:01.951 --> 01:48:10.134]  I'm the guy that spends all of his life in libraries and researching and doing the writing and putting it together for myself.
[01:48:10.935 --> 01:48:12.875]  It wasn't until 1988 that I really started going
[01:48:14.989 --> 01:48:22.235]  I'm just amazed at how much we don't know in this country, how things are right in front of you and we don't even see them.
[01:48:38.799 --> 01:48:43.761]  And of course, most of the people that are even in the system or think they know, they're in lower rooms.
[01:48:43.781 --> 01:48:49.403]  That's why their symbol is the pyramid, that great symbol of compartmentalization.
[01:48:49.644 --> 01:48:51.224]  Yeah, that is true.
[01:48:51.304 --> 01:49:05.690]  That's why they are able to get away with most of what they do, is because most people, you know, it's a fact of life that most people will support what they want to hear.
[01:49:05.850 --> 01:49:07.971]  They're not going to support what they don't want to hear.
[01:49:08.832 --> 01:49:14.774]  And therefore that's why the government gives to people what they want to hear.
[01:49:15.154 --> 01:49:18.095]  That's why religions give to people what they want to hear.
[01:49:19.395 --> 01:49:30.738]  But too many people are not ready to really look at the real truth about the symbols and emblems and how governments work, how courts work, how banks work.
[01:49:30.838 --> 01:49:36.780]  It's one hell of a story and it's about time that people start looking at these subjects.
[01:49:37.313 --> 01:49:39.395]  I've been trying to talk about it for many years.
[01:49:40.035 --> 01:49:43.198]  Again, my website is jordanmaxwell.com.
[01:49:43.238 --> 01:49:43.478]  Go on.
[01:49:43.498 --> 01:49:44.739]  There's a lot of stuff on there.
[01:49:44.879 --> 01:49:45.299]  There is.
[01:49:45.319 --> 01:49:46.280]  Jordan, stay there.
[01:49:46.300 --> 01:49:46.920]  We're going to come back.
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:48.822]  I want to talk about what their master plan is, though.
[01:49:48.942 --> 01:49:54.146]  I mean, we clearly know what their program is, and we'll discuss it when we get back and get Jordan's view.
[01:49:54.901 --> 01:49:57.763]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:58.003 --> 01:49:58.704]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:58.804 --> 01:49:59.605]  Alex Jones here.

[01:50:04.949 --> 01:50:11.694]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:12.014 --> 01:50:13.996]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:14.196 --> 01:50:17.039]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:17.139 --> 01:50:21.803]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:22.003 --> 01:50:26.407]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.647 --> 01:50:33.874]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[01:52:26.750 --> 01:52:27.050]  I think?
[01:53:02.248 --> 01:53:05.789]  You know, folks, I go off what I can prove.
[01:53:05.949 --> 01:53:12.192]  Interesting thing today, this never happens.
[01:53:13.792 --> 01:53:17.994]  Magically, my website from about five years ago,
[01:53:29.818 --> 01:53:36.202]  Well, four years ago has been uploaded without us even doing it to where you can't even see my main page.
[01:53:37.203 --> 01:53:47.329]  Simultaneously, when this started happening five minutes into the show today, about an hour and 50 minutes ago, all the network streams for audio went down for the Internet.
[01:53:48.449 --> 01:53:53.252]  And, of course, we need to get it where our people can get into the IT system themselves and fix it.
[01:53:53.793 --> 01:53:54.693]  But I don't control that.
[01:53:55.153 --> 01:53:57.615]  We're fixing it on our end at Infowars.com.
[01:53:58.388 --> 01:54:20.099]  But I've been on there before with Colonel Craig Roberts, who's one of the people that's given me intel on what's going on, and right when I talk about this particular corporation based down on the river here in Austin, Texas, it's really a government front, talking about how they want to shut me down, right as I said shut us down, we were cut off.
[01:54:20.819 --> 01:54:22.220]  Satellites themselves were cut off.
[01:54:22.921 --> 01:54:27.825]  Well, I think that there's something very big going on here that's been going on for thousands of years, and it's a spiritual battle.
[01:54:52.817 --> 01:55:01.864]  And I'm not sure that any of us really understand the full implications of what the word God means, what the scriptures are really all about.
[01:55:02.544 --> 01:55:07.788]  The implications are just staggering for the future of the human race.
[01:55:07.908 --> 01:55:11.811]  Who are we when we were created by God?
[01:55:12.392 --> 01:55:21.919]  I have no problem believing in a divine presence in the universe that men have called God, but I am really fearful of looking at
[01:55:22.566 --> 01:55:28.090]  I think it's really going to be a very difficult subject to look at.
[01:55:28.591 --> 01:55:32.153]  Who really is in control of this planet?
[01:55:32.714 --> 01:55:35.336]  Where are we going as human creatures?
[01:55:36.257 --> 01:55:41.621]  What they have in mind is building something called the New Man.
[01:55:41.641 --> 01:55:45.824]  Spell N-E-W-M-A-N, the New Man.
[01:55:46.587 --> 01:55:56.513]  The new man is going to be a human which has all of its soul taken from it so that you are nothing more than a worker, a consumer.
[01:55:58.874 --> 01:56:01.415]  It was explained in the motion pictures.
[01:56:01.475 --> 01:56:05.518]  My friend Dick Gregory said once that Hollywood does three things only.
[01:56:06.078 --> 01:56:10.440]  It tells you what it's already done, what they're doing now, and what they're getting ready to do.
[01:56:11.461 --> 01:56:14.803]  And if you go back and rent the movie Network,
[01:56:15.518 --> 01:56:24.385]  In which Ned Beatty, as the head of the network, explains to... That is a one-world government run by the corporations, and that you yourself are a share of stock.
[01:56:24.485 --> 01:56:24.966]  That's it.
[01:56:25.186 --> 01:56:29.730]  And he said, all your anxieties will be put to rest.
[01:56:31.171 --> 01:56:40.759]  All the entertainment, everything will be provided for you, so that all you have to do is just do what you're told and go along to get along, and everything is going to be fine.
[01:56:41.671 --> 01:57:10.125]  And I think that this is a horrible darkness that the world is slowly but surely being led into, and I think it calls into question now, who are we as humans, who owns us, and what ultimately is going to happen here, because I believe that the Creator is going to eventually have had enough, and when that happens, who was it Thomas Jefferson said,
[01:57:10.775 --> 01:57:14.056]  I fear and I shudder when I think that God is just.
[01:57:15.137 --> 01:57:27.262]  The point he was making was when God decides to do something, when that divine presence in the universe decides to make a move, it doesn't matter now what you think.
[01:57:27.482 --> 01:57:29.663]  It just doesn't matter what side you're on.
[01:57:29.863 --> 01:57:32.264]  Now you've caused some serious problems.
[01:57:34.011 --> 01:57:34.271]  Big Brother.
[01:57:34.291 --> 01:57:34.792]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.187 --> 01:57:54.268]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.929 --> 01:57:55.769]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.510 --> 01:57:57.431]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.091 --> 01:58:01.755]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.275 --> 01:58:06.359]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:14.807 --> 01:58:25.533]  The New World Order is controlled by psychopathic control freaks whose religion demands that they control us, dumb us down, and kill us in ritualistic war that they engineer.
[01:58:25.553 --> 01:58:37.939]  Doesn't matter if it was the Babylonians, the Aztecs, the Egyptians, the Romans, the Nazis, the Communists, the Neocons.
[01:58:37.959 --> 01:58:40.761]  They do the exact same thing over and over again.
[01:58:42.074 --> 01:58:43.395]  We're good to go.
[01:58:43.415 --> 01:58:43.615]  I think?
[01:59:05.049 --> 01:59:08.811]  Basically cookies attached to your own body, like the internet cookies tracking everything you do.
[01:59:09.271 --> 01:59:13.573]  Total regulation, total psychological testing, and forced drugging.
[01:59:15.233 --> 01:59:16.154]  Total enslavement.
[01:59:17.654 --> 01:59:20.455]  Jordan Maxwell, why do they want this police state?
[01:59:20.475 --> 01:59:28.839]  I mean, they're really gearing up this police state with all of the classical, fascistic, Nazi regalia abounding.
[01:59:29.361 --> 01:59:34.245]  Well, it's a religious thing that they're involved in.
[01:59:34.285 --> 01:59:38.568]  They believe that God has given the world to them.
[01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:56.783]  You can trace this back into the Middle Ages, and I hate to bring this up again, but it's part of the problem, is that the Vatican, the Pope was declared that the entire world belonged to God.
[01:59:57.466 --> 02:00:09.353]  And the entire earth was given to Jesus and consequently until such time as Jesus comes back the Vatican represented and the Pope represented the Vicar of Christ on earth.
[02:00:09.594 --> 02:00:11.755]  Vicar means someone who stands in for.
[02:00:12.395 --> 02:00:23.142]  And so there were deals made between the Vatican and the British King John back in the 12th century in which it was stated
[02:00:24.092 --> 02:00:36.456]  In documents that the Vatican represents Jesus, who owns the whole world, and until such time as Jesus comes back, the Vatican owns the entire earth, period, and everything on it.
[02:00:36.856 --> 02:00:46.018]  Now, to be clear then, of course, at least from my study, in many cases, the Vatican is just itself being used as a tool by another group behind that.
[02:00:46.038 --> 02:00:48.939]  I mean, we had Pope John Paul II calling for a new world order.
[02:00:48.959 --> 02:00:49.779]  Oh, of course.
[02:00:49.839 --> 02:00:51.400]  Calling for one world religion.
[02:00:53.141 --> 02:00:54.902]  And, of course, the Protestant church.
[02:00:54.942 --> 02:00:59.424]  We have Pat Robertson on TV when he's praying for Jesus to heal somebody.
[02:00:59.764 --> 02:01:04.906]  He does the Diablo clearly and then thrusts it towards the TV camera.
[02:01:05.227 --> 02:01:06.427]  I mean, why is he doing that?
[02:01:06.627 --> 02:01:10.589]  Oh, I'm telling you, it is astounding watching all of this stuff happening.
[02:01:10.649 --> 02:01:18.193]  But, again, it's a very difficult subject to deal with without being able to see and take some real time to go into it.
[02:01:19.529 --> 02:01:22.010]  I've dealt with some of this.
[02:01:22.090 --> 02:01:25.752]  Why are they getting so much more obvious, or is it just that we're just more aware?
[02:01:26.272 --> 02:01:28.173]  No, I think that the time is running out.
[02:01:28.313 --> 02:01:33.635]  I think that even the Mayan calendar, as you know, talks about 2012.
[02:01:35.436 --> 02:01:47.701]  Charles Ballett, in a book back in the early 90s, wrote a book called 1999, The End of the World, in which he went through all of the different prophecies of the ancient peoples of the world,
[02:01:48.340 --> 02:02:01.725]  And talked about the fact that all of the ancient peoples that had holy writings talked about a time when the entire world would become a prison planet, so to speak.
[02:02:02.425 --> 02:02:12.889]  And that he was saying, Charles Belitz was saying, it looks like from 1999 on we're going to see the fulfillment of all of these ancient prophecies from the
[02:02:13.499 --> 02:02:19.081]  Ancient world religions have talked about a dark force which is taking over the entire world.
[02:02:19.822 --> 02:02:21.102]  And I think that's what we're seeing.
[02:02:22.503 --> 02:02:28.505]  And we'll get your take on the police officer listening right now wearing a black uniform.
[02:02:28.525 --> 02:02:30.706]  He has a black helmet and a black machine gun.
[02:02:32.326 --> 02:02:34.007]  He thinks he's serving the good.
[02:02:34.547 --> 02:02:40.770]  Why is he then wearing the uniform of an inherent, an acolyte of Saturn, as you said?
[02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:41.450]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.559 --> 02:02:49.481]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:50.162 --> 02:02:51.443]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:02:51.643 --> 02:02:57.408]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:02:57.668 --> 02:03:02.932]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:03:03.213 --> 02:03:04.834]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order...
[02:03:04.974 --> 02:03:06.495]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:03:42.628 --> 02:03:44.709]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:55.545]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform and NTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.805 --> 02:04:07.031]  Black murky elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.371 --> 02:04:13.074]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.314 --> 02:04:13.955]  We're good to go.
[02:04:45.156 --> 02:04:47.176]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[02:04:47.776 --> 02:04:49.157]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[02:04:50.057 --> 02:05:03.640]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals, and we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[02:05:04.577 --> 02:05:09.160]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:14.443]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[02:05:14.983 --> 02:05:27.871]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.libertydollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:05:34.161 --> 02:05:39.006]  That's www.libertydollar.org or call toll free 888-421-6181.
[02:05:50.285 --> 02:05:50.945]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.585 --> 02:05:52.646]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.366 --> 02:05:54.486]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.126 --> 02:05:55.967]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.687 --> 02:05:57.547]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.267 --> 02:06:02.208]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.448 --> 02:06:06.609]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.029 --> 02:06:13.191]  We've got about 51 minutes left with our guest, Jordan Maxwell.
[02:06:13.231 --> 02:06:14.211]  JordanMaxwell.com.
[02:06:14.251 --> 02:06:16.992]  We'll save us some of his books and videos before he leaves us.
[02:06:18.274 --> 02:06:19.615]  I know that we have loaded phone lines.
[02:06:20.095 --> 02:06:25.318]  I really ask the listeners to have questions for Jordan Maxwell concerning the Illuminati and the New World Order.
[02:06:25.338 --> 02:06:28.780]  I know we've got people that have been holding since before he even joined us.
[02:06:28.800 --> 02:06:37.685]  Like I said in the first hour, I wasn't taking calls, so we are now going to take some calls coming up here a little bit later in this hour, but I really want them to be concerning this.
[02:06:37.985 --> 02:06:40.086]  It's a wide road.
[02:06:40.146 --> 02:06:47.430]  I mean, there's a ton of things to talk about that are involved in the New World Order and in the Illuminati and what they're doing, but
[02:06:49.079 --> 02:06:53.201]  I would just ask that we try to keep it somewhat on topic when we do take calls.
[02:06:54.221 --> 02:06:56.542]  Jordan's studying the New World Order, studying their program.
[02:06:56.962 --> 02:07:03.145]  A lot of it's hidden, but even something that's classified, once it's implemented, you can observe the implementation.
[02:07:03.585 --> 02:07:05.206]  You can observe the operation.
[02:07:05.246 --> 02:07:06.727]  You can observe the orders.
[02:07:06.767 --> 02:07:16.991]  You can observe the program and get a pretty clear case, as you said, off the patterning of what they're doing, what their program is.
[02:07:17.311 --> 02:07:18.432]  And they also talk.
[02:07:19.153 --> 02:07:19.593]  We're good to go.
[02:07:46.197 --> 02:07:50.294]  And all these movies about how we have a tyrannical government that's going to kill us.
[02:07:51.221 --> 02:07:57.004]  I mean, they really are now manifesting and really throwing it in our face, trying to bring it about.
[02:07:57.564 --> 02:08:04.087]  The question is, if we're able to get the word out to their minions and their servants, I know most of them are actually possessed by this spirit.
[02:08:04.107 --> 02:08:04.867]  I mean, that's what it is, folks.
[02:08:04.947 --> 02:08:18.893]  It's like a poison, gas, a disease, a virus they've been infected with that's spread through the neural network of this larger human Internet, as many scientists have described it,
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:32.870]  But I think instinctively now, as we get to the final cusp of this, to the flashpoint, the critical mass, the plunge point, a lot of people are starting to get sweaty palms and starting to get nervous and going, man, this is really evil.
[02:08:32.890 --> 02:08:34.391]  I don't think I'm going to survive this.
[02:08:34.711 --> 02:08:40.855]  I think a lot of people that were promised all this power are beginning to realize they're going to be destroyed first, not last.
[02:08:41.356 --> 02:08:47.240]  I think people are starting to really smell the stench of death, kind of like Hitler's own command.
[02:08:48.499 --> 02:08:53.100]  Now that they've gotten deep down this rat hole, your comments on what I just said.
[02:08:54.081 --> 02:08:55.421]  I couldn't agree more.
[02:08:55.641 --> 02:09:02.323]  I think that the people who are in the military, military guys are beginning to suspect there's something wrong.
[02:09:02.983 --> 02:09:16.487]  In my travels around, I have discovered that no matter how wealthy you are, no matter how comfortable people are, no matter how good a job you might have, everybody in this country and around the world
[02:09:17.028 --> 02:09:24.611]  No matter what you're stationed in life, everyone knows there's something serious, bad going on on the earth.
[02:09:25.211 --> 02:09:26.632]  And everybody knows it.
[02:09:27.312 --> 02:09:35.316]  But those people who are being thrown into prison and beaten and tortured, they know it up front big time.
[02:09:35.376 --> 02:09:40.538]  But everybody knows there's something wrong and nobody can seem to put their finger on it.
[02:09:41.458 --> 02:09:43.279]  But it's growing every day.
[02:09:43.359 --> 02:09:46.060]  It's getting worse and worse as each day goes by.
[02:09:46.972 --> 02:09:49.454]  And like you said, it's true.
[02:09:49.674 --> 02:09:52.575]  It is going to some kind of a crescendo.
[02:09:53.196 --> 02:09:54.196]  Something is coming.
[02:09:55.057 --> 02:09:59.299]  When you were talking about police, the very word police goes back to policy.
[02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:05.242]  Let me give you an example of where the police come in to this picture.
[02:10:06.243 --> 02:10:13.387]  When this country was founded, back in the old Wild West days when you can watch all the old cowboy movies,
[02:10:13.934 --> 02:10:14.716]  We're good to go.
[02:10:28.630 --> 02:10:36.233]  And as long as both of them were armed, they could pull a gun on each other, they could draw on each other, and one of them killed the other guy.
[02:10:36.253 --> 02:10:40.554]  By the way, Hollywood over-exaggerates all of this with millions of murders that never were committed.
[02:10:40.654 --> 02:10:43.195]  Actually, the overall crime rate was lower than it is now.
[02:10:43.395 --> 02:10:49.177]  Well, yeah, but the point I'm making is that why was it that in America you could carry a gun...
[02:10:49.944 --> 02:10:51.425]  And that you could go where you want.
[02:10:51.465 --> 02:10:58.488]  Because the 1870s hadn't come around with the founding of the police force in the Praetorian Guard blue in New York.
[02:10:58.828 --> 02:11:06.232]  Well, and that's the point I was going to make, is that you were not under, today we're not under law.
[02:11:07.753 --> 02:11:10.514]  Any attorney will tell you that we're not under law.
[02:11:10.914 --> 02:11:14.416]  We are under something referred to as public policy.
[02:11:15.271 --> 02:11:17.614]  It's like rulemaking, rulemaking.
[02:11:17.694 --> 02:11:18.094]  It is.
[02:11:18.134 --> 02:11:18.835]  That's all it is.
[02:11:18.935 --> 02:11:22.780]  It's public policy of a privately owned corporation.
[02:11:23.561 --> 02:11:27.906]  And so the policy is dreamt up by politicians.
[02:11:28.524 --> 02:11:30.045]  And enforced by police.
[02:11:30.245 --> 02:11:33.868]  We went into receivership after the Civil War and nationwide.
[02:11:34.228 --> 02:11:37.410]  They set up the police forces in the privately incorporated cities.
[02:11:37.791 --> 02:11:45.396]  Now they are absorbing the original elected magistrate of the people, that being the sheriff.
[02:11:45.456 --> 02:11:56.664]  Now the rightful peace officer is being replaced with the law enforcement or the policy enforcement special forces commando police.
[02:11:56.784 --> 02:11:58.004]  That's what I'm talking about.
[02:11:58.084 --> 02:11:59.425]  You understand it well.
[02:11:59.485 --> 02:12:00.405]  That's exactly right.
[02:12:00.925 --> 02:12:07.466]  That's what I was trying to say, is that we are no longer under the original operation of America.
[02:12:07.526 --> 02:12:10.527]  We are under something called public policy.
[02:12:10.707 --> 02:12:17.348]  And consequently, it's like going into Sears and having a disagreement, and they say, well, it's our policy.
[02:12:17.488 --> 02:12:18.368]  Well, is that the law?
[02:12:18.548 --> 02:12:19.769]  No, no, no, it's not the law.
[02:12:19.849 --> 02:12:21.429]  It's our policy.
[02:12:21.929 --> 02:12:26.110]  Well, the corporation called United States, which was incorporated back in 18...
[02:12:27.337 --> 02:12:35.962]  The 1960s has a policy, and so it has its own policy, and this is where we get the idea of a democracy.
[02:12:36.742 --> 02:12:39.564]  Many people don't understand these words and terms.
[02:12:41.625 --> 02:12:48.568]  They think a democracy means all of us Americans, we can vote and do what we want because we're a democracy.
[02:12:48.648 --> 02:12:51.050]  That's not what the word democracy means at all.
[02:12:51.670 --> 02:12:53.731]  It has no meaning like that whatsoever.
[02:12:54.266 --> 02:13:02.633]  Democracy is the people who are the shareholders of the corporation can vote on who they want for their next president.
[02:13:03.104 --> 02:13:06.988]  And they can vote on certain things that the corporation wants to do.
[02:13:07.028 --> 02:13:08.670]  And that's what it was in Greece.
[02:13:08.710 --> 02:13:26.888]  They had the Blackstones and the Whitestones, and only gentried, elite, mass, slave-owning, land-owning individuals in major cities, just a few hundred people, and they would march up to the hill, and they would even vote on whether they wanted to kill one of their own who'd shot his mouth off, and they'd go throw him off the cliff.
[02:13:27.268 --> 02:13:28.389]  That was right there at hand.
[02:13:28.449 --> 02:13:30.290]  That is your democracy.
[02:13:30.310 --> 02:13:33.433]  And our founding fathers said it's the worst system there is.
[02:13:33.593 --> 02:13:35.754]  Yeah, that's exactly what the founding fathers said.
[02:13:35.814 --> 02:13:40.878]  They said the worst thing that could ever happen is democracy.
[02:13:41.058 --> 02:13:47.863]  Because democracy comes from the demos, the word in Greek, demos, meaning mob and ocracy, the rule of.
[02:13:48.123 --> 02:13:52.206]  So democracy is the rule of the mob, the mob rule.
[02:13:52.606 --> 02:13:56.049]  Which simply means it doesn't matter what the law says.
[02:13:56.661 --> 02:14:02.765]  What matters is that the person got elected, he got the most votes, he's the boss, period.
[02:14:03.205 --> 02:14:03.746]  End of sentence.
[02:14:03.946 --> 02:14:04.646]  It doesn't matter.
[02:14:04.847 --> 02:14:19.436]  It means that they have Caesar-type dictatorial powers, and they can whip the mob up into whatever they want, and if the mob, 51%, says, we're going to take Crassus' land and divide it amongst ourselves, that is done.
[02:14:19.457 --> 02:14:21.438]  It's a democracy.
[02:14:22.318 --> 02:14:25.981]  Of course, America was supposed to be a republic.
[02:14:26.539 --> 02:14:28.220]  Which was founded on laws.
[02:14:28.480 --> 02:14:30.541]  America was a nation of law.
[02:14:30.561 --> 02:14:35.003]  Well, that's actually what Caesar did right before Christ came.
[02:14:35.183 --> 02:14:38.144]  Caesar actually expanded the Senate to 200.
[02:14:38.204 --> 02:14:40.325]  He actually brought in the mob.
[02:14:40.746 --> 02:14:48.449]  He actually started displacing and using that mob to actually go after the general public.
[02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:51.230]  And he kept all the people happy.
[02:14:51.410 --> 02:14:54.712]  All the people were docile and happy with Caesar because he gave them
[02:14:55.348 --> 02:14:56.209]  We're good to go.
[02:14:56.429 --> 02:14:57.170]  I think?
[02:15:22.406 --> 02:15:31.051]  That the situation is so large and so all-encompassing that whatever is going to happen, the whole world is going to feel it.
[02:15:31.291 --> 02:15:31.751]  Everything.
[02:15:31.891 --> 02:15:33.332]  Everyone's going to feel this one.
[02:15:33.972 --> 02:15:41.256]  Whatever it is that's being played out right now at the top, something terrible is coming on the world.
[02:15:41.476 --> 02:15:44.138]  The entire world of mankind is going to feel it.
[02:15:44.538 --> 02:15:46.219]  There's going to be no place to run to.
[02:15:47.032 --> 02:15:50.354]  And I am totally convinced that we are in the last days.
[02:15:50.714 --> 02:15:58.318]  And just as the scripture talked about, I am sure that we are going to see some very terrible things coming now.
[02:15:58.499 --> 02:16:08.864]  Meanwhile, Pat Robertson and others are now saying that basically Jesus is going to appear and be our world leader and be physical, and he's going to have to cut the heads off of the people that don't worship him.
[02:16:09.205 --> 02:16:11.246]  But the Bible 101, that's antichrist.
[02:16:12.792 --> 02:16:15.333]  I mean, it's gotten so sick right in front of everybody.
[02:16:15.353 --> 02:16:16.054]  Yeah, I know.
[02:16:16.334 --> 02:16:19.555]  Right in front of everybody, and so many people don't see it.
[02:16:20.496 --> 02:16:23.797]  They will when it's finally over, when it's finally too late.
[02:16:24.397 --> 02:16:39.104]  You know, when I first came to California in 1959, I joined the German-American Friendship Club, and I used to go to all the German parties, and I would ask them, as a 19-year-old kid, I would ask all the old German couples,
[02:16:41.134 --> 02:16:45.237]  How is it that Adolf Hitler could have done what he did and you didn't know?
[02:16:45.377 --> 02:16:53.102]  You didn't know where he was leading the country ultimately, what was going to happen and where all of this stuff was going that he was doing?
[02:16:53.642 --> 02:16:56.424]  And they would always tell me the same thing, all of them.
[02:16:56.444 --> 02:16:58.425]  They would always say, well, we didn't know.
[02:16:58.485 --> 02:16:59.946]  We're just following the government.
[02:17:00.066 --> 02:17:06.891]  After all, he is the head of the government and the government, you know, they're in charge and so we had to follow our government.
[02:17:07.634 --> 02:17:12.037]  Well, at 19 years old, I can't argue with the old people.
[02:17:12.438 --> 02:17:18.222]  But now at 65 years old, I look back on all of this, and now I know what the real story was.
[02:17:18.783 --> 02:17:21.905]  It wasn't that the Germans didn't know what Hitler was doing.
[02:17:22.746 --> 02:17:25.428]  It was that they chose not to know.
[02:17:25.648 --> 02:17:31.973]  That's why the Bible has Jesus saying, There is none so blind as those who choose not to see.
[02:17:33.044 --> 02:17:34.968]  And this is what's condemned the world.
[02:17:35.369 --> 02:17:37.494]  Not that we're in the dark, but that we chose it.
[02:17:38.015 --> 02:17:38.496]  Well, that's it.
[02:17:39.257 --> 02:17:40.099]  It's doublethink.
[02:17:40.720 --> 02:17:42.704]  They play little games with themselves.

[02:21:49.793 --> 02:21:51.314]  This show is documented.
[02:21:51.814 --> 02:21:54.556]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:54.996 --> 02:21:58.498]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:21:58.938 --> 02:22:03.161]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:22:03.221 --> 02:22:08.664]  Chris, and Chris, and Pat, and Terry, and Jason, everybody.
[02:22:09.685 --> 02:22:13.107]  Here in just a few minutes, but talking to Jordan Maxwell of JordanMaxwell.com.
[02:22:14.011 --> 02:22:17.774]  I've been involved in investigating the New World Order, the Illuminati, since 1959.
[02:22:18.055 --> 02:22:25.822]  Involved in a lot of different historical actions, fighting it and exposing it and educating people.
[02:22:28.024 --> 02:22:35.671]  I just want a lot of the listeners out there who are part of this system and who have rationalized and made excuses, I just want them to know that
[02:22:37.572 --> 02:22:50.341]  The culture has taught them that laying down makes you safe, but in the natural world, the way predators operate, the way elites have always operated, the lion goes after the wounded wildebeest.
[02:22:51.222 --> 02:22:56.766]  The owl goes after the little cowering bunny rabbit.
[02:22:57.306 --> 02:22:59.288]  It doesn't go after another big predator.
[02:23:00.263 --> 02:23:04.546]  And we've been taught that you can't fight City Hall, lay down, don't talk about politics and religion.
[02:23:04.806 --> 02:23:05.747]  Just shut up!
[02:23:06.427 --> 02:23:09.489]  All of this is antithetical to what America was founded on.
[02:23:10.169 --> 02:23:16.853]  And can you speak to those people out there that know deep down in their guts they're serving the Antichrist world government system?
[02:23:16.873 --> 02:23:21.816]  Do you have any words of wisdom for them, Mr. Maxwell?
[02:23:22.337 --> 02:23:27.940]  Well, what you said is true, and I think it's interesting that you brought that up because in my mind,
[02:23:28.667 --> 02:23:48.846]  I was thinking to myself for a long time now that I'm just tired of talking about this subject and I wanted to go back to my first love which is theology and religion and the Bible because I have been ordained as a minister twice in my life and I've just kind of given up on the subject of government.
[02:23:48.926 --> 02:23:52.650]  I was honored to be invited to be on your program but
[02:23:53.095 --> 02:23:56.537]  Normally I haven't been talking about government much anymore.
[02:23:56.637 --> 02:23:58.698]  I had not intended to.
[02:23:59.319 --> 02:24:10.505]  Because I feel that there's a bigger subject that I need to contend with and deal with, and that is the theological implications of where we're going.
[02:24:10.525 --> 02:24:17.409]  So you believe that if we change ourselves and are loving and good and do the right thing, that at a cellular level that will change the whole world?
[02:24:17.929 --> 02:24:18.850]  No, I don't think so.
[02:24:18.950 --> 02:24:19.870]  I don't think we can.
[02:24:19.890 --> 02:24:21.291]  I don't think that's possible.
[02:24:22.626 --> 02:24:25.667]  I understand the concept, but I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:24:26.587 --> 02:24:29.348]  It hasn't happened in the past 10,000 years.
[02:24:29.368 --> 02:24:35.129]  There's no reason to think that the human race is going to wake up and do anything different than it always has.
[02:24:35.149 --> 02:24:44.572]  There's always been a handful of people who were on the cutting edge intellectually and spiritually, evolved people who could see the problems.
[02:24:45.682 --> 02:24:56.707]  You know, read some of the writings from Tacitus and some of the writers in the Roman Empire who saw what was coming and they knew what was on the way for the Roman Empire, but nobody was listening.
[02:24:58.487 --> 02:25:11.152]  So I think there's always been a handful of spiritually minded, cutting edge people who understand what was going on and where it's going, but they've always been in the minority.
[02:25:11.933 --> 02:25:14.814]  The majority have always supported the dictator.
[02:25:16.109 --> 02:25:27.697]  Ludwig von Mises said in one of his books that the population of every country has always, and in every case, always supported the dictator.
[02:25:28.117 --> 02:25:38.904]  There has never been a time in the history of the world that a dictator came into power that the population of the country did not support him wholeheartedly.
[02:25:39.464 --> 02:25:43.927]  So we know that that is in the nature of people and mankind
[02:25:44.457 --> 02:25:46.358]  To support the bully.
[02:25:46.799 --> 02:25:49.180]  We want to support him so he doesn't hurt us.
[02:25:49.700 --> 02:25:51.221]  So we support the bully.
[02:25:51.522 --> 02:25:56.745]  But I discovered that if you just punch him in the nose, I mean, why lick his boots?
[02:25:57.085 --> 02:26:01.228]  Well, I know, but I'm just saying that that's what most people are willing to do.
[02:26:01.748 --> 02:26:08.713]  They're willing to just go along to get along and throw their friend to the alligator, hoping the alligator will eat them last.
[02:26:10.013 --> 02:26:16.255]  And I like that quote that was the first governor of California.
[02:26:16.275 --> 02:26:18.996]  I'm trying to remember how it went.
[02:26:19.036 --> 02:26:22.637]  It said that no one is safe when freedom fails.
[02:26:22.897 --> 02:26:30.119]  The best men rot in filthy jails while those who cried appease, appease are hung by those they tried to please.
[02:26:30.999 --> 02:26:33.600]  So there is no common ground with tyranny.
[02:26:34.355 --> 02:26:36.617]  And this kind of violence is going on.
[02:26:36.817 --> 02:26:42.400]  Somewhere along the line the human race is going to awaken to the fact that we have been had.
[02:26:43.181 --> 02:26:47.263]  And the people who have gone along to get along are going to be dealt with accordingly.
[02:26:48.484 --> 02:26:51.406]  It's a terrible thing which is coming on the earth.
[02:26:52.046 --> 02:26:53.847]  We're going back into the dark ages.
[02:26:53.967 --> 02:26:58.730]  We're going under for a thousand years into a thousand years of darkness.
[02:26:58.970 --> 02:27:00.011]  And I can see it coming.
[02:27:01.065 --> 02:27:02.868]  Well, Jordan, you know, that's the thing.
[02:27:02.988 --> 02:27:04.430]  I mean, I've read the Bible.
[02:27:04.450 --> 02:27:06.693]  It's clear as...
[02:27:15.911 --> 02:27:19.173]  Clear as the sky every day.
[02:27:19.393 --> 02:27:20.034]  It's crystal.
[02:27:21.014 --> 02:27:23.856]  That people aren't raptured out.
[02:27:23.896 --> 02:27:25.117]  That Antichrist comes.
[02:27:25.977 --> 02:27:27.838]  But these churches, that's not true.
[02:27:27.879 --> 02:27:28.939]  We don't have a thing to worry about.
[02:27:29.259 --> 02:27:30.380]  Take your microchip.
[02:27:30.640 --> 02:27:31.341]  It's of Jesus.
[02:27:36.244 --> 02:27:37.144]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.625 --> 02:27:39.246]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.146 --> 02:27:42.828]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.313 --> 02:27:48.915]  Government is best which governs least.
[02:27:49.455 --> 02:27:50.776]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:27:51.217 --> 02:27:53.919]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:27:54.360 --> 02:27:57.022]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:27:57.462 --> 02:28:03.928]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:28:26.360 --> 02:28:26.720]  Have you?
[02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:28.800]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[02:28:30.641 --> 02:28:32.021]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:28:32.041 --> 02:28:32.721]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:28:39.109 --> 02:28:40.273]  Osama been forgotten.

[02:29:46.281 --> 02:29:48.641]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:29:48.901 --> 02:29:52.723]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:29:53.043 --> 02:29:53.863]  Read the labels.
[02:29:54.303 --> 02:29:58.425]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:29:58.645 --> 02:30:02.826]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:30:03.206 --> 02:30:08.068]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:30:08.468 --> 02:30:12.030]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.

[02:31:14.158 --> 02:31:19.999]  The elite has total control of the major systems, the governmental systems of the world.
[02:31:22.520 --> 02:31:24.760]  And what are they threatened by?
[02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:28.081]  The family, the individual human being.
[02:31:28.601 --> 02:31:30.061]  They openly say they are.
[02:31:30.701 --> 02:31:36.423]  They openly talk about how, well, you owe allegiance to your family, we've got to destroy the family so it's only to the state.
[02:31:37.123 --> 02:31:39.063]  It is a brave new world plantation.
[02:31:39.543 --> 02:31:42.604]  Aldous Huxley, two months before he died,
[02:31:43.507 --> 02:31:45.328]  Gave a lecture at Berkeley.
[02:31:45.908 --> 02:31:47.068]  University of California at Berkeley.
[02:31:47.088 --> 02:31:47.968]  We played it here on air.
[02:31:47.988 --> 02:31:52.189]  I've got to find that CD or find it online again and play it.
[02:31:52.709 --> 02:31:54.410]  It was probably five years ago last time I played it.
[02:31:54.430 --> 02:31:57.391]  And he said, listen, my brother was a top socialist.
[02:31:57.411 --> 02:32:00.171]  Later became the head of UNESCO at the UN that Bush has signed back onto.
[02:32:00.191 --> 02:32:04.533]  He wrote that book in 1933, folks.
[02:32:04.773 --> 02:32:04.533]  1933.
[02:32:04.853 --> 02:32:07.493]  Radiating the kids to make them stupid.
[02:32:07.573 --> 02:32:08.394]  Forced drugging.
[02:32:08.454 --> 02:32:09.734]  Different tiers and classes.
[02:32:10.572 --> 02:32:22.997]  The THX 1138, Brave New World, Gattaca, The Island, We, that was written, I guess, in like 1918 or something, which is even the precursor of that.
[02:32:23.057 --> 02:32:24.637]  But he said, no, this is the plan.
[02:32:25.998 --> 02:32:26.958]  I'm warning you.
[02:32:28.699 --> 02:32:30.860]  This is what the government's going to do.
[02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:36.022]  I've been in facilities in England where people have electronics wires hooked into their brains.
[02:32:36.042 --> 02:32:37.542]  We're already remote controlling people.
[02:32:37.562 --> 02:32:39.843]  Of course, he died quickly after saying that.
[02:32:40.828 --> 02:32:42.990]  But people have tried to warn us.
[02:32:43.030 --> 02:32:44.312]  And folks, this isn't a joke.
[02:32:44.992 --> 02:32:45.833]  This isn't a game.
[02:32:46.054 --> 02:32:57.587]  Whoever thought that we'd have Sean Hannity, and we'd have Pat Robertson, and we'd have Andy Rooney, and Tommy Thompson, former head of Health and Human Services.
[02:32:59.332 --> 02:33:01.693]  Traveling the country saying every child needs a chip.
[02:33:01.773 --> 02:33:03.774]  Now, Hannity says they need a chip.
[02:33:04.054 --> 02:33:06.455]  Andy Rooney says to prove you're a good person, you need one.
[02:33:06.756 --> 02:33:10.657]  And it runs the gamut from that extreme to Pat Robertson going, oh, it's no big deal.
[02:33:11.138 --> 02:33:13.119]  Thumb scan, retina scan, take a chip.
[02:33:13.139 --> 02:33:14.079]  That's not bad.
[02:33:15.480 --> 02:33:16.400]  Just accept it.
[02:33:17.481 --> 02:33:19.481]  Again, could it get any more obvious?
[02:33:19.562 --> 02:33:21.562]  We're not the weirdos up here talking about this.
[02:33:22.083 --> 02:33:24.404]  We were the weirdos 10 years ago, 15 years ago.
[02:33:24.424 --> 02:33:26.805]  People like Jordan Maxwell talking about this 20 years ago.
[02:33:27.552 --> 02:33:35.184]  And I read books 30 years ago, well, not 30 years ago, books that were written 30 years ago, saying that all this was going to happen.
[02:33:35.224 --> 02:33:37.187]  And everything those old-timers said came true.
[02:33:37.548 --> 02:33:38.549]  How do those old-timers know?
[02:33:38.589 --> 02:33:39.651]  They were reading documents.
[02:33:39.691 --> 02:33:40.533]  They had sources.
[02:33:41.013 --> 02:33:42.315]  They understood the program.
[02:33:43.036 --> 02:33:51.705]  And I've been studying this so long that two months before 9-11, just from indicators and key phrases and things I saw and things that were going on, I never make predictions.
[02:33:51.745 --> 02:33:52.126]  You know that.
[02:33:52.166 --> 02:33:57.511]  I said, they're going to use Bin Laden as their CIA asset to take the blame for attacking the World Trade Centers.
[02:33:57.952 --> 02:33:59.253]  Call Bush, tell him don't do it.
[02:34:00.895 --> 02:34:03.778]  I mean, it was so clear because they were dropping hints on TV.
[02:34:05.283 --> 02:34:09.386]  I saw Gary Hart and Rudman on hardball going, big buildings, New York, going to go down.
[02:34:09.626 --> 02:34:16.311]  They were celebrating, doing little signs, shaking hands together, it's going to get bad, going to be bad, wait until we see what happens.
[02:34:16.572 --> 02:34:17.572]  They were laughing.
[02:34:17.933 --> 02:34:19.033]  It was so inappropriate.
[02:34:19.374 --> 02:34:24.658]  But again, that's part of their religion, to openly count coup, to laugh at us, and to do this.
[02:34:25.238 --> 02:34:25.618]  Jordan...
[02:34:26.920 --> 02:34:29.181]  I mean, I know you say politically, but it is spiritual.
[02:34:29.641 --> 02:34:30.821]  What will life be like?
[02:34:30.861 --> 02:34:31.762]  What's your time frame?
[02:34:32.042 --> 02:34:38.804]  How long until we are literally in the compact cities being exterminated in an orderly fashion, drugged out?
[02:34:39.405 --> 02:34:43.746]  I mean, how long on their time frame until the mass extermination begins?
[02:34:43.806 --> 02:34:45.647]  And then we're going to go to calls.
[02:34:45.847 --> 02:34:54.550]  I think that they are aware of the fact that there are some very powerful forces in the universe that are against them, and they've got to hurry up
[02:34:55.483 --> 02:34:57.406]  And speed up their timetable.
[02:34:57.846 --> 02:35:08.418]  I think that they're looking at... I believe that they're really concerned about 2012, but I've heard people in the military talking about 2007.
[02:35:09.359 --> 02:35:15.425]  And after 2007, if something isn't done to save the human race, it's over.
[02:35:15.545 --> 02:35:16.086]  It's finished.
[02:35:16.604 --> 02:35:22.145]  By 2007, I've had some very high military people, friends of mine, say that in private.
[02:35:22.245 --> 02:35:26.546]  Well, all the major martial law preparations, I mean, this is public.
[02:35:27.126 --> 02:35:28.746]  NORAD, NORTHCOM, is 2008.
[02:35:29.126 --> 02:35:29.706]  Yep.
[02:35:31.507 --> 02:35:33.067]  Well, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:35:33.147 --> 02:35:34.927]  I think it's really close now.
[02:35:35.587 --> 02:35:39.048]  When we're going to wake up and find out there's just no way out.
[02:35:39.948 --> 02:35:42.048]  And it's been coming for a long time.
[02:35:42.548 --> 02:35:45.549]  I would only ask that everyone, when they finally find
[02:35:45.939 --> 02:35:47.480]  We'll figure out what's going on.
[02:35:47.940 --> 02:35:50.842]  And they finally see the end result of all of this.
[02:35:51.422 --> 02:35:52.923]  Just remember the people.
[02:35:52.943 --> 02:35:57.445]  Try and remember who they are who were telling you everything's just fine.
[02:35:57.605 --> 02:36:11.913]  You know, the Tom Brookoffs and all these other talking head jokers on NBC and CBS who are smiling and telling you everything's just fine and it's all a silly nonsensical conspiracy theory.
[02:36:13.506 --> 02:36:15.007]  So just remember those people.
[02:36:15.247 --> 02:36:28.070]  Just remember who they are, and when your family comes undone, and when the come down comes down, just try and remember all the smiling faces and talking heads that were telling you everything was just fine.
[02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:37.772]  Because what they're planning on, these guys, the Tom Brookhawks of the world, they're planning on being well taken care of by their masters.
[02:36:37.852 --> 02:36:39.933]  You know, they're like the Judas Cow.
[02:36:40.629 --> 02:36:41.230]  We're good to go.
[02:36:41.250 --> 02:36:41.730]  We're good to go.
[02:36:41.770 --> 02:36:42.190]  We're good to go.
[02:37:07.739 --> 02:37:11.304]  And that people who are talking about such things were a bunch of goofs.
[02:37:11.504 --> 02:37:12.626]  Just remember who they are.
[02:37:12.866 --> 02:37:17.252]  Well, just on the face of it, we're looking at imminent implosion of the economy.
[02:37:18.454 --> 02:37:21.699]  Bush has borrowed more money than all of their presidents combined before him.
[02:37:23.528 --> 02:37:24.789]  It's racing higher every day.
[02:37:24.809 --> 02:37:34.954]  I mean, I've had, Jordan, as you know, top genetic engineers have been going public, but I've interviewed them, and many others have.
[02:37:35.215 --> 02:37:40.897]  People who believe in this, and they say, listen, this is already unraveling the fabric of the genome.
[02:37:41.218 --> 02:37:43.659]  This is already destroying the environment.
[02:37:44.439 --> 02:37:47.060]  And folks, I don't mean the phony environmental group trying to steal your property.
[02:37:47.100 --> 02:37:52.282]  I mean real, actual coding of the foundation of life.
[02:37:52.742 --> 02:37:56.443]  And the globalists are just giggling and laughing, accelerating and all.
[02:37:56.883 --> 02:37:58.523]  They want to destroy everything, Jordan.
[02:37:59.044 --> 02:38:02.965]  And they've got a space shuttle and a space station.
[02:38:03.705 --> 02:38:05.346]  And what is a shuttle?
[02:38:05.406 --> 02:38:06.106]  It's a bus.
[02:38:06.186 --> 02:38:07.926]  You take a bus when you're leaving town.
[02:38:08.487 --> 02:38:12.948]  I am totally convinced that this whole space station, space shuttle...
[02:38:14.436 --> 02:38:18.458]  The telescope, the Hubble telescope, this is all military.
[02:38:18.998 --> 02:38:24.420]  I think the powers that be in this world are getting ready to quietly get out of here.
[02:38:24.480 --> 02:38:28.101]  They made movies about this a long time ago.
[02:38:28.221 --> 02:38:29.361]  Yeah, Moonraker.
[02:38:29.582 --> 02:38:31.062]  Right, exactly.
[02:38:31.202 --> 02:38:39.425]  I think that they're getting ready to get out of here because they know the comedown is getting ready to come down and they're going to take off quietly.
[02:38:40.009 --> 02:38:40.389]  I think so.
[02:39:10.345 --> 02:39:22.231]  And I'm watching all of this happening, and today we... You know, how many Americans go out to Florida and watch the space shuttle take off, and they've got their flags out there like a bunch of fools, and they are loving it.
[02:39:22.331 --> 02:39:28.014]  They can't wait to see the... Well, they admit that 84% of the space shuttle program is classified.
[02:39:28.634 --> 02:39:29.655]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:31.516 --> 02:39:37.639]  When I see the Americans jumping up and down, and they're hooraying, they're seeing the rocket take off,
[02:39:39.147 --> 02:39:49.679]  I wonder how many people have ever wondered how much toxic poison is the space shuttle pumping into the atmosphere in Florida?
[02:39:49.899 --> 02:39:53.503]  What kind of deadly poisons are coming out of the back end of that rocket?
[02:39:55.626 --> 02:39:56.486]  For the space shuttle.
[02:39:56.786 --> 02:39:58.326]  But most people don't think about that.
[02:39:59.867 --> 02:40:09.050]  We also know for a fact that the space shuttle is a 1937 design by Werner Von Braun and that it's just a public tinker toy and heavy lifter that they like to show us.
[02:40:09.630 --> 02:40:12.291]  For at least 20 years they've had high-powered space planes.
[02:40:12.491 --> 02:40:13.691]  Oh, you can bet on that.
[02:40:13.912 --> 02:40:14.792]  I've seen them.
[02:40:15.532 --> 02:40:18.233]  I have personally with my own eyes been a witness to
[02:40:18.843 --> 02:40:25.068]  Some of the stuff that's really out there that very few people have any idea in the world is out there.
[02:40:25.088 --> 02:40:27.310]  Well, the V2 bomber was sacred for 10 years.
[02:40:27.570 --> 02:40:28.151]  Yeah, I know.
[02:40:28.591 --> 02:40:29.992]  I mean, that's what they do.
[02:40:30.032 --> 02:40:31.814]  Let's take some calls before we run out of time here.
[02:40:32.134 --> 02:40:32.955]  Okay.
[02:40:33.315 --> 02:40:36.838]  Jordan, before we do that, tell folks about some of your books and videos.
[02:40:36.878 --> 02:40:43.664]  Well, I was going to say, it's very difficult to talk about all of this when we're under time restraints.
[02:40:43.704 --> 02:40:46.086]  But I've got a lot of videos and DVDs
[02:40:46.542 --> 02:40:47.663]  It's the bestseller.
[02:41:14.608 --> 02:41:39.189]  And I'm amazed that this was done back in, I don't know, 89 or 90, and it's still the bestseller because it's a two-hour program in which I went through all kinds of occult symbols, emblems, words, and terms, and it's just two hours of a slide presentation called The Basic Slide Presentation.
[02:41:39.711 --> 02:41:40.992]  It went all over the world.
[02:41:41.752 --> 02:41:44.233]  I'm amazed at how far that thing has gone.
[02:41:44.533 --> 02:41:45.494]  We've aired that here locally.
[02:41:46.674 --> 02:41:49.335]  On the local TV channel, let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:41:49.435 --> 02:41:50.156]  Chris in Mass.
[02:41:50.176 --> 02:41:50.676]  Thanks for holding.
[02:41:50.696 --> 02:41:51.016]  Go ahead.
[02:41:51.456 --> 02:41:52.016]  Hi, Jordan.
[02:41:52.036 --> 02:41:52.417]  Hi, Alex.
[02:41:52.737 --> 02:41:53.737]  Hi there.
[02:41:53.837 --> 02:41:54.157]  Okay.
[02:41:54.838 --> 02:41:55.378]  I need help.
[02:41:56.758 --> 02:42:02.621]  Is good always supposed to be the minority traveling through the dark woods, or will
[02:42:03.346 --> 02:42:13.572]  Does truth and beauty ever have a dominant force over this disgusting, horrible... I know, Alex, you don't believe in reptilians or anything like that, but... I never said that.
[02:42:13.732 --> 02:42:22.438]  I know, I said Alex doesn't, but... Well, I think that's not important, but it is important, the question you're asking.
[02:42:22.558 --> 02:42:26.760]  Is there ever going to be a time when good will triumph in the world?
[02:42:27.961 --> 02:42:30.182]  As far as I'm concerned, I don't think so.
[02:42:30.202 --> 02:42:31.263]  Let me tell you why.
[02:42:33.223 --> 02:42:34.343]  I mean, it's my opinion.
[02:42:34.843 --> 02:42:38.464]  I think that we are in this world to prove who we are.
[02:42:38.764 --> 02:42:42.805]  And the most important part of our life is when you leave here.
[02:42:43.425 --> 02:42:51.527]  Because if you believe that there is a divine presence or a God, I think that we are being put under compulsion now.
[02:42:51.627 --> 02:42:53.787]  We are being tested.
[02:42:54.087 --> 02:42:56.848]  And someone from on high is watching us.
[02:42:57.509 --> 02:42:59.151]  To see how we're going to react.
[02:42:59.531 --> 02:43:02.774]  Yeah, I am scared of this test, but I'm willing to go through it.
[02:43:03.274 --> 02:43:04.315]  Gotta move on, thank you.
[02:43:04.335 --> 02:43:05.416]  Gotta move on, but thank you.
[02:43:05.897 --> 02:43:07.298]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[02:43:07.318 --> 02:43:07.999]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:43:10.601 --> 02:43:11.102]  Hello?
[02:43:11.462 --> 02:43:12.342]  Yes, sir, you're on the air.
[02:43:12.563 --> 02:43:13.363]  Okay, thank you.
[02:43:14.464 --> 02:43:17.086]  I just completely blanked out when you put me on the air.
[02:43:17.126 --> 02:43:17.867]  It doesn't matter, sir.
[02:43:17.887 --> 02:43:18.447]  Go ahead.
[02:43:18.527 --> 02:43:20.168]  It happens every once in a while.
[02:43:20.288 --> 02:43:29.435]  I just want to talk about, real quick, I'm just kind of pulling this out of my head, but I was actually dating a young woman, a Christian girl.
[02:43:29.475 --> 02:43:31.216]  She was a real good girl, a sweet girl.
[02:43:31.857 --> 02:43:37.141]  But I have a concealed carry permit, and I'm prior military.
[02:43:37.885 --> 02:43:39.886]  And she thought your gun was a devil weapon.
[02:43:40.206 --> 02:43:43.847]  Yeah, that's what I'm getting at.
[02:43:43.987 --> 02:43:47.048]  I mean, it was... She just worshipped the ground I walked on.
[02:43:47.088 --> 02:43:48.188]  I treated her very well.
[02:43:48.268 --> 02:43:49.509]  I was affectionate to her.
[02:43:49.829 --> 02:43:52.610]  And, you know, we were really crazy about each other.
[02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:58.031]  I never displayed any kind of criminal or aggressive behavior with it.
[02:43:58.151 --> 02:43:59.152]  I just carried it on me.
[02:43:59.352 --> 02:44:01.352]  I said I have a concealed carry permit.
[02:44:01.832 --> 02:44:02.833]  I'm prior military.
[02:44:02.893 --> 02:44:03.833]  I tried to go through...
[02:44:04.580 --> 02:44:10.802]  And you know, just explain to her why we have a Constitution, why we have a Second Amendment.
[02:44:10.882 --> 02:44:12.123]  Oh, you're right.
[02:44:12.383 --> 02:44:18.185]  You know, things down in history, why American citizens carry weapons, how it prevents tyranny, this kind of thing.
[02:44:18.765 --> 02:44:20.226]  And it's just amazing.
[02:44:20.919 --> 02:44:30.544]  You know, no matter how good of a guy you are, how good you treat a girl, especially women in our society, I mean, it doesn't matter how law-abiding you are.
[02:44:30.565 --> 02:44:32.946]  Well, I'm not going to sit here and bash women, but I'll tell you this.
[02:44:33.046 --> 02:44:38.729]  Most of the propaganda targets women because 80% of purchases are decided or made by women.
[02:44:39.129 --> 02:44:41.551]  And, yeah, they tell the women, don't discipline your kids.
[02:44:41.591 --> 02:44:43.412]  That way the state can take them and do it themselves.
[02:44:43.712 --> 02:44:45.333]  They tell the women, don't have weapons.
[02:44:45.353 --> 02:44:45.913]  That's bad.
[02:44:46.454 --> 02:44:50.436]  And it's the same thing when slaves would show up on ships in Rome or in America.
[02:44:50.876 --> 02:44:51.437]  Yeah, you said it all.
[02:44:51.477 --> 02:44:52.198]  I totally agree with you.
[02:45:09.842 --> 02:45:18.948]  So, I mean, if you've got a problem with you being a real man, you know, I mean, I don't know if I'd want to be with a woman who didn't want to have a man who'd protect her or who wouldn't want to protect herself.
[02:45:19.368 --> 02:45:20.088]  Yeah, I know.
[02:45:20.108 --> 02:45:25.352]  Because I bet she feels real safe when a cop comes by in a black mask in the robes of Saturn.
[02:45:25.372 --> 02:45:34.337]  Yeah, until most people, until they have had experiences, they live in a dream world.
[02:45:34.377 --> 02:45:35.998]  But when you wake up and find out
[02:45:37.050 --> 02:45:40.271]  The police are not here to keep law and order.
[02:45:40.331 --> 02:45:43.271]  They're here to enforce public policy.
[02:45:44.011 --> 02:45:46.972]  And it has nothing to do with American law.
[02:45:47.492 --> 02:45:52.733]  I mean, there's a whole story behind where police come from, where the word comes from.
[02:45:53.373 --> 02:45:58.094]  All of that I've discussed on some of my DVDs that you need to get.
[02:45:58.334 --> 02:45:58.634]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:58.734 --> 02:46:05.375]  We've got to finish up here, but what's your final point, sir?
[02:46:05.856 --> 02:46:13.660]  Well, I think the thing is that I see the biggest problem is that people are in denial.
[02:46:14.080 --> 02:46:17.422]  It's like alcoholics who don't want to be told they're alcoholics.
[02:46:17.462 --> 02:46:19.884]  They have a little problem, but there's no problem in it really.
[02:46:20.564 --> 02:46:27.348]  And so too many people in this country and around the world, especially in this country, are in denial.
[02:46:27.368 --> 02:46:28.128]  And it's willful.
[02:46:28.208 --> 02:46:28.588]  It's willful.
[02:46:28.608 --> 02:46:29.269]  Yeah, it's willful.
[02:46:30.547 --> 02:46:35.330]  One day they're going to wake up and find out it's too late and they could have done something it didn't.
[02:46:35.690 --> 02:46:37.391]  Alright, let's take another call here.
[02:46:37.431 --> 02:46:38.672]  Pat in Ohio.
[02:46:38.712 --> 02:46:39.332]  Pat, go ahead.
[02:46:39.792 --> 02:46:40.313]  Oh, hello.
[02:46:40.653 --> 02:46:41.393]  Hi, Pat.
[02:46:42.354 --> 02:46:46.716]  Yeah, I have a question to Jordan and both of you, really.
[02:46:46.736 --> 02:46:48.797]  Good afternoon to both of you.
[02:46:48.957 --> 02:46:51.759]  Concerning the Antichrist, what do you think of Prince Charles?
[02:46:54.517 --> 02:46:55.518]  Thanks for the call, ma'am.
[02:46:55.778 --> 02:46:56.939]  A lot of people say that.
[02:46:57.019 --> 02:46:59.060]  I don't think Prince Charles is the Antichrist.
[02:46:59.401 --> 02:47:02.222]  I think there will be an Antichrist, but I think more than that, it's a system.
[02:47:03.904 --> 02:47:05.244]  These things always come in threes.
[02:47:05.284 --> 02:47:08.006]  The devil always imitates God's system.
[02:47:08.026 --> 02:47:13.530]  So I believe you're going to have a system, you're going to have the Antichrist, and then you're going to have his false prophet.
[02:47:13.690 --> 02:47:15.051]  A comment on that, Jordan?
[02:47:16.412 --> 02:47:17.713]  Nothing more than what you said.
[02:47:17.753 --> 02:47:19.694]  I think that it is a system.
[02:47:20.194 --> 02:47:27.697]  Because the very word Christ, you need to get into the word Christ, where it comes from, what it means, and then you will begin to understand the Antichrist.
[02:47:27.797 --> 02:47:31.418]  It is a system that's in operation, not an individual.
[02:47:31.518 --> 02:47:38.100]  I know what the Scriptures say, but I believe it is a whole system that we are being led into.
[02:47:39.100 --> 02:47:40.241]  So I agree with you on that.
[02:47:40.921 --> 02:47:42.341]  Yep, Antichrist v. System.
[02:47:42.381 --> 02:47:43.682]  And folks, if you don't think...
[02:47:44.777 --> 02:47:47.918]  The stuff our government, this illegitimate government, is doing is anti-Christ.
[02:47:47.978 --> 02:47:48.578]  I mean, what is it?
[02:47:48.638 --> 02:47:50.559]  It is the opposite of Christ.
[02:47:51.459 --> 02:47:52.119]  No doubt about it.
[02:47:52.819 --> 02:47:55.940]  But then it also, at the same time, masquerades around and says it's good.
[02:47:56.721 --> 02:48:00.282]  Well, I know, but that's what the Scripture said would happen.
[02:48:00.322 --> 02:48:02.822]  I mean, it was prophecy being fulfilled right in front of us.
[02:48:03.343 --> 02:48:11.305]  Again, I'm telling you, I think that for myself, I'm seeing that the spiritual aspect of this world problem
[02:48:11.920 --> 02:48:22.246]  It's something that I want to concentrate more on than talking about government because there's a lot of people talking about what's going on in government and government is becoming more and more obvious.
[02:48:22.647 --> 02:48:25.268]  Well, Jordan, we've got one more segment left.
[02:48:25.708 --> 02:48:26.729]  I want to take a few final calls.
[02:48:27.149 --> 02:48:28.490]  Terry and Jason and a few others.
[02:48:28.510 --> 02:48:36.895]  I want to get you back up with us in the near future to do a couple hours purely on the whole spiritual dimension, okay?
[02:48:37.375 --> 02:48:38.116]  Let's do that.
[02:48:38.396 --> 02:48:39.297]  Okay, we'll be right back.
[02:48:39.317 --> 02:48:39.697]  Stay with us.
[02:48:42.082 --> 02:48:43.023]  We're good to go.
[02:49:04.096 --> 02:49:06.078]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.278 --> 02:49:09.141]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.221 --> 02:49:13.885]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:14.085 --> 02:49:18.489]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.749 --> 02:49:25.956]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.216 --> 02:49:28.638]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.798 --> 02:49:30.540]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:45.968 --> 02:49:54.212]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:49:54.473 --> 02:49:58.835]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:49:59.115 --> 02:50:08.040]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:11.862]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:50:12.142 --> 02:50:17.166]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons for one year, whichever comes first.
[02:50:17.486 --> 02:50:24.172]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:50:24.699 --> 02:50:25.339]  What about you?
[02:50:25.979 --> 02:50:31.341]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:50:47.202 --> 02:50:53.125]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.345 --> 02:50:55.606]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.806 --> 02:51:02.149]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:02.549 --> 02:51:03.149]  I think so too.
[02:51:18.038 --> 02:51:18.358]  We're good to go.
[02:51:51.545 --> 02:51:54.326]  Folks, the New World Order is such a fraud.
[02:51:54.446 --> 02:51:58.547]  It offers nothing but a bunch of cheap wrapping, a bunch of packaging.
[02:52:16.089 --> 02:52:18.490]  And it looks good from a certain angle, but you really delve into it.
[02:52:18.530 --> 02:52:22.990]  These are unhappy, evil people, and they just think, more, more, more, I'll give them the answer.
[02:52:23.010 --> 02:52:30.372]  And they are being spiritually led by this dark force, the devil, the old serpent, whatever you want to call it, into setting up a system to destroy.
[02:52:31.672 --> 02:52:34.133]  And it is real, folks.
[02:52:34.153 --> 02:52:39.154]  I mean, whether, again, if you don't even believe in God, or you don't believe in anything spiritual, believe me, the elite does.
[02:52:39.294 --> 02:52:40.574]  That much is proven to be true.
[02:52:41.124 --> 02:52:43.566]  You know, bedrock, totally visible.
[02:52:44.026 --> 02:52:52.393]  The elite throughout history on all continents, devil worships, drinks blood, murders masses of people, chops hearts out, and worships flying snakes.
[02:52:53.113 --> 02:52:55.755]  Now, whether those flying snakes are real or not is debatable.
[02:52:55.875 --> 02:52:57.076]  Why do they do it, though?
[02:52:57.757 --> 02:53:00.138]  Why do peoples who've never met each other do the same thing?
[02:53:00.158 --> 02:53:03.381]  There is something compelling them, something driving it.
[02:53:04.293 --> 02:53:10.098]  And it's extremely aberrant, and we're talking to Jordan Maxwell, jordanmaxwell.com.
[02:53:10.118 --> 02:53:15.082]  We have a big fat link to it up on infowars.com and on prisonplanet.com.
[02:53:15.863 --> 02:53:16.844]  Terry in Florida.
[02:53:16.864 --> 02:53:17.624]  I've got to move quick here.
[02:53:17.664 --> 02:53:18.905]  Terry, you're on the air with Jordan Maxwell.
[02:53:18.946 --> 02:53:19.246]  Go ahead.
[02:53:19.506 --> 02:53:22.088]  Yes, I wanted to thank Jordan very much.
[02:53:22.308 --> 02:53:29.634]  And there was a question you said, Jordan, about that you didn't think anything would come on this earth, you know, any happiness ever.
[02:53:29.755 --> 02:53:32.477]  I mean, isn't Jesus supposed to come back and take us out of here?
[02:53:33.132 --> 02:53:37.774]  Well, that's one of the things I'd like to really do.
[02:53:37.954 --> 02:53:49.178]  I'd like to get into the theological mess that has been provided by the Illuminati for us, because we know that the governments are corrupt, banks are corrupt, the military is corrupt.
[02:53:49.198 --> 02:54:00.122]  We know that corruption is everywhere, but most people have no idea as to how really corrupted the theology of the Western world is and how it's been
[02:54:00.666 --> 02:54:02.047]  I've got a question about I have
[02:54:27.549 --> 02:54:34.253]  I recently started reading this book called Freemasonry and its Ancient Mystic Rite by C.W.
[02:54:34.593 --> 02:54:35.074]  Leadbeater.
[02:54:35.154 --> 02:54:36.675]  Leadbeater, yeah.
[02:54:36.775 --> 02:54:53.605]  Okay, and then it talks about in there about how they can go up into their subconscious and escape the plane of reality here that we see here.
[02:54:56.705 --> 02:54:59.767]  I believe they do this via meditation and so on, whatever.
[02:54:59.887 --> 02:55:04.330]  And it's also the degrees of the Masonry and the Knights Templar and all that stuff.
[02:55:04.751 --> 02:55:05.451]  Almost out of time.
[02:55:05.971 --> 02:55:18.760]  Okay, well, my question is, do you think, if you've studied this, do you think that this is where we have to face these guys, is on this level instead of on this, on here, on the physical plane where they will win?
[02:55:18.780 --> 02:55:24.584]  Yeah, well, as I said, I believe the really important subject
[02:55:25.054 --> 02:55:36.121]  Which I have been working with for years that we haven't really gotten into is the occult or hidden significance in the theological foundations of the Western world.
[02:55:36.181 --> 02:55:37.742]  Where these words have come from.
[02:55:38.082 --> 02:55:42.005]  I talk about it in one of my DVDs called Signs of Destiny.
[02:55:42.585 --> 02:55:43.646]  All right, we're out of time.
[02:55:44.086 --> 02:55:44.926]  I'm sorry to Jason.
[02:55:44.947 --> 02:55:45.927]  I'm sorry to Jordan Maxwell.
[02:55:45.947 --> 02:55:46.708]  We're just out of time.
[02:55:47.108 --> 02:55:48.229]  Got to have you back up sometime.
[02:55:48.249 --> 02:55:50.070]  Jordan Maxwell, it was very interesting.
[02:55:50.350 --> 02:55:51.170]  Thank you for joining us.
