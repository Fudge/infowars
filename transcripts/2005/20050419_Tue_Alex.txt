[00:00:05.684 --> 00:00:06.325]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.985 --> 00:00:08.025]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.745 --> 00:00:09.865]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.506 --> 00:00:11.346]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.086 --> 00:00:13.126]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.646 --> 00:00:17.587]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.827 --> 00:00:21.928]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:57.737]  From Nazareth they came With a ragtag band To bring a revolution Some would make them king Others couldn't stand for that The cross was a solution
[00:00:59.591 --> 00:01:28.695]  But he rose again Wise men follow him But he rose again Wise men follow him Thank God for the renegade And the lies beneath For the head of Water train Without the renegade Lord knows where
[00:01:31.806 --> 00:01:45.513]  We're close to heroes, renegades of mine.
[00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:55.819]  We railed against the crown, another ragtag man, declaring independence.
[00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.240]  We're good to go.
[00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:43.808]  We're good to go.
[00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.272]  In the world today Who are the renegades?
[00:03:17.893 --> 00:03:37.863]  In the world today We hang out for the renegades And the lives they lead Far ahead of Their time Without the renegades No one knows where we
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.306]  When it comes to heroes, renegade your mind.
[00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:25.781]  My friends, it is the 19th day of April 2005, the 10th anniversary of the globalist bombing in Oklahoma City, the 12th anniversary of the 51-day siege that ended in a fiery inferno.
[00:04:25.981 --> 00:04:28.583]  Again, we have the Delta Force documents.
[00:04:28.663 --> 00:04:30.904]  They went in and killed those people.
[00:04:32.341 --> 00:04:34.503]  This is just some of the issues we'll talk about today.
[00:04:34.543 --> 00:04:36.565]  A lot of geopolitical news as well.
[00:04:37.045 --> 00:04:40.028]  And wide open phones will be taking your calls.
[00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:46.213]  In the next two hours and 55 minutes, the website's freshly updated for you daily.
[00:04:46.753 --> 00:04:52.158]  Our InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:52.878 --> 00:04:53.939]  I'm back in the saddle.
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:55.621]  Stay with us.
[00:04:57.182 --> 00:04:57.983]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:03.023]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.043 --> 00:05:06.026]  The behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.166 --> 00:05:10.071]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.111 --> 00:05:14.355]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.696 --> 00:05:18.460]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.402]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:23.265 --> 00:05:28.671]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:31.875]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:05:32.035 --> 00:05:34.898]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:41.506]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.026 --> 00:05:42.746]  We're good to go.
[00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:43.327]  We're good to go.

[00:07:41.172 --> 00:07:41.592]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.040]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.761 --> 00:08:09.861]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.501 --> 00:08:11.362]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.102 --> 00:08:14.003]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.023 --> 00:08:17.484]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.844 --> 00:08:21.966]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.948 --> 00:08:28.988]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:29.028 --> 00:08:30.449]  It is Tuesday, April 19, 2005.
[00:08:30.929 --> 00:08:35.571]  The 10-year anniversary of Oklahoma City, the globalist bombing.
[00:08:36.989 --> 00:08:42.873]  On the 12th anniversary of the siege at Mount Carmel in Waco, Texas.
[00:08:44.654 --> 00:08:46.295]  I'm not up in Waco this year.
[00:08:46.315 --> 00:08:47.575]  I haven't gone in several years.
[00:08:47.756 --> 00:08:53.319]  Just because I think I can do more good being here on the radio.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.742]  Several TV crews wanted me to come up to Waco today so they could interview me.
[00:08:58.242 --> 00:09:06.247]  Quite frankly, I've told them they can get as much important information from the people up there and that it's more important that I be here on the radio.
[00:09:06.954 --> 00:09:24.385]  I wasn't here yesterday because I was in California on business, working on some things that could be very damaging to the New World Order, and I am now back in my Central Texas Command Center, back in my nest, back in my broadcast cockpit, and it feels good to be home.
[00:09:24.585 --> 00:09:25.686]  God bless Texas.
[00:09:26.046 --> 00:09:31.450]  I love, love my town Austin, and I love Texas, and it's good to be here.
[00:09:33.095 --> 00:09:34.598]  And I want to thank Erskine.
[00:09:34.619 --> 00:09:35.661]  I want to thank Jack Blood.
[00:09:35.681 --> 00:09:38.707]  I want to thank, of course, Paul Watson yesterday.
[00:09:39.589 --> 00:09:43.839]  We had all three of the gentlemen here on the broadcast co-hosting together.
[00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:47.290]  And I had a chance getting back into town late last night.
[00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:50.873]  You're part of the rebroadcast, and they did a great job.
[00:09:50.933 --> 00:09:57.059]  So hopefully in the future when I do have to go out of town, you'll be able to hear some of those same gentlemen here filling in for me.
[00:09:57.579 --> 00:10:00.061]  We're going to be taking your calls throughout the broadcast today.
[00:10:00.121 --> 00:10:01.923]  I'm going to move quickly through your calls.
[00:10:01.963 --> 00:10:03.825]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:10:03.865 --> 00:10:04.986]  And the websites are Infowars.com.
[00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:16.024]  ImprisonedPlanet.tv Global stocks take a dive.
[00:10:17.705 --> 00:10:21.729]  Stocks slumped worldwide, extending last week's decline.
[00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:25.773]  As concern deepened, the profit growth is waning.
[00:10:26.852 --> 00:10:35.179]  Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average had its biggest drop in 11 months, and it's been dropping for 9 years, by the way.
[00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:43.486]  And benchmarks in Europe erased all of 2005 gains on all the major indexes and indices.
[00:10:44.534 --> 00:10:51.477]  And Royal Phillips Electronics, NV, slid after the company posted first quarter earnings that missed estimates.
[00:10:51.837 --> 00:11:05.023]  They say the slide began when IBM reported that orders for their durable goods, their computer systems and components, slid to all-time lows despite high profits last year.
[00:11:05.583 --> 00:11:13.247]  Sony Corporation, of course I added that part, it's not in this article, Sony Corporation fell as its mobile phone unit said profit plunged
[00:11:14.017 --> 00:11:16.078]  And Alaria Group, Inc.
[00:11:16.379 --> 00:11:24.843]  and Pfizer, Inc., which announced earnings this week, were among 25 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks that slipped in Europe as well.
[00:11:25.164 --> 00:11:29.746]  The Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index Global Equity Benchmark fell 0.9.
[00:11:32.094 --> 00:11:39.638]  Yesterday in London, its fifth successive decline, the Nikkei tumbled 3.8 and dropped below 11,000 for the first time in four months.
[00:11:40.018 --> 00:11:46.162]  The Dow Jones Euro Stock 50 Index slid as much as 2.7, losing its gain for the year.
[00:11:48.863 --> 00:11:53.305]  And meanwhile, the dollar, they have the headlines, the dollar is rebounding.
[00:11:53.345 --> 00:11:59.689]  It's rebounded, what, about a point in the last month from its 45-plus percent drop in the last three years.
[00:12:00.521 --> 00:12:08.006]  And if you look at the overall graph for the last four years, it is just a continual free fall.
[00:12:08.946 --> 00:12:13.429]  And it'll go back up a few points, then drop three points, then go back up a point and drop two points.
[00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:17.091]  But you do the average, it just doesn't look good.
[00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:21.214]  Meanwhile, they tell us that the weak dollar is good for manufacturing.
[00:12:21.234 --> 00:12:28.799]  The problem is our manufacturing base has almost been completely debased and dismantled and shipped to China and India.
[00:12:29.474 --> 00:12:38.436]  Things have gotten so bad that even Latin America, that in the last 10 years since NAFTA was passed, had built up in the first five.
[00:12:38.516 --> 00:12:41.857]  It's now imploding and moving to Asia as well.
[00:12:42.377 --> 00:12:52.299]  The question is, who is Asia going to sell to once the industrialized world has been completely divested of its middle class?
[00:12:54.423 --> 00:12:55.164]  We're good to go.
[00:12:55.384 --> 00:12:55.564]  I think?
[00:13:15.905 --> 00:13:17.106]  You know, they've cut your leg off.
[00:13:17.126 --> 00:13:17.906]  You're bleeding to death.
[00:13:17.926 --> 00:13:19.387]  Here, let's cut the other one off.
[00:13:19.427 --> 00:13:25.351]  That will lessen the bleeding in the other leg because the rest of the blood will flow out through the other extremity.
[00:13:27.152 --> 00:13:35.217]  The stump where your appendage once was connected to the body socioeconomic political system.
[00:13:36.178 --> 00:13:38.199]  So global stocks take a dive.
[00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:41.001]  Karl Rove decries coverage of government.
[00:13:41.401 --> 00:13:44.663]  White House strategist laments obsessive reliance on polls.
[00:13:45.450 --> 00:14:01.856]  The media has started applying the horse race style of campaign coverage to daily reporting on government, leading to adversarial reporting that can obscure the truth just to create conflict, President Bush's chief political strategist said yesterday.
[00:14:02.976 --> 00:14:04.397]  This is all staged, folks.
[00:14:04.457 --> 00:14:09.659]  They always, with a second-term president, tell you that the approval rating is low.
[00:14:09.719 --> 00:14:10.579]  It was low before.
[00:14:11.443 --> 00:14:16.709]  That gives you the illusion of some type of equilibrium and that people are waking up.
[00:14:17.009 --> 00:14:21.774]  People are waking up, but they're not waking up within the controlled political system.
[00:14:22.935 --> 00:14:25.157]  And they just jack the numbers back up later.
[00:14:25.578 --> 00:14:27.059]  Same thing with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:14:28.601 --> 00:14:34.507]  And people are wondering whether he'll recommit to a new gubernatorial run.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:41.383]  And I believe Schwarzenegger in the next month will announce that he's running for governor again.
[00:14:41.403 --> 00:14:55.070]  No governor has lost re-election as an incumbent for their second term since the early 1940s, unless you count the recall of Gray Davis.
[00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:03.294]  But Arnold could sit out, I mean I could be wrong, and go ahead and make preparations for a presidential run in 08...
[00:15:05.047 --> 00:15:05.567]  Or in 012.
[00:15:06.308 --> 00:15:09.269]  And I'll try to get more into that later as well.
[00:15:10.309 --> 00:15:11.050]  Some good news.
[00:15:12.090 --> 00:15:23.435]  After its success in the last 19 days, Minuteman Project, expanding to four states, civilian monitors will also target employers that hire illegal aliens.
[00:15:23.575 --> 00:15:24.155]  Absolutely.
[00:15:24.175 --> 00:15:25.475]  You know, it's funny.
[00:15:25.715 --> 00:15:31.678]  The government says, tattle on your neighbors, spy on your neighbors, look through the crack in the fence.
[00:15:32.138 --> 00:15:33.499]  Is the man and woman arguing?
[00:15:33.559 --> 00:15:34.339]  Call the police?
[00:15:35.248 --> 00:15:37.450]  I mean, this is in the terrorist manuals and handbooks.
[00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:43.434]  Drills at schools where they simulate homeschoolers being terrorists and their parents being terrorists.
[00:15:44.215 --> 00:15:47.717]  All of this mindlessness that does nothing to, quote, protect us is going on.
[00:15:48.418 --> 00:16:00.807]  But meanwhile, it's evil to have citizens simply sit on private or public property calling the Border Patrol when they see illegals from all corners of the planet pouring across our poorest southern border.
[00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:03.854]  Our northern border is quite porous as well.
[00:16:03.914 --> 00:16:05.274]  In many respects it's even worse.
[00:16:05.894 --> 00:16:10.556]  The numbers in the aggregate are greater for the southern border, obviously.
[00:16:11.716 --> 00:16:13.337]  The 2,000 mile stretch.
[00:16:14.117 --> 00:16:19.759]  But now they're going to be also reporting people who have obvious illegal aliens working at their businesses.
[00:16:20.439 --> 00:16:21.740]  Which I think is a great idea.
[00:16:23.037 --> 00:16:32.259]  Because this debases the currency, it debases the wages, and it is a magnet to suck even more of the third world populations into this nation.
[00:16:33.139 --> 00:16:36.820]  And we've got six and a half billion people roughly on the face of the planet right now.
[00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.441]  Do we want them all coming here?
[00:16:39.901 --> 00:16:41.401]  Because that's what they're trying to do.
[00:16:43.182 --> 00:16:44.462]  And it's bad for everybody.
[00:16:45.859 --> 00:16:55.346]  And I just want to ask the La Raza and the Mecha people out there, why do you have the Fortune 500 funding you?
[00:16:55.486 --> 00:17:01.590]  You say you're anti-establishment, but you've got the biggest tax-free foundation from the globe funding you.
[00:17:02.871 --> 00:17:11.237]  Why does the media say it's okay for you to have a group called the Race or the Raza, La Raza, but if any other group did it, it would be decried?
[00:17:12.538 --> 00:17:12.998]  The globalist...
[00:17:42.774 --> 00:17:45.336]  Don't have your best interest at heart in every other case.
[00:17:45.396 --> 00:17:45.997]  You know that.
[00:17:46.497 --> 00:17:48.899]  Why then do you get all prideful?
[00:17:49.059 --> 00:17:50.640]  Oh, we're taking America down.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.461]  Ha, ha, ha.
[00:17:51.901 --> 00:17:52.702]  Our time is here.
[00:17:52.782 --> 00:17:54.143]  And believe me, I read the publications.
[00:17:54.183 --> 00:17:54.924]  I talk to the people.
[00:17:55.264 --> 00:17:55.664]  I hear it.
[00:17:55.724 --> 00:17:56.145]  I see it.
[00:17:56.925 --> 00:17:58.667]  Why are the same people then funding you?
[00:17:58.727 --> 00:17:59.527]  Don't be stupid.
[00:17:59.908 --> 00:18:01.649]  Don't be conned and manipulated.
[00:18:03.573 --> 00:18:13.115]  Continuing, Project spokesman Gray Deacon told WorldNet Daily the operation has been flooded with calls and emails from thousands of citizens across the country volunteering to serve.
[00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:23.098]  Currently, hundreds of volunteers, many legally carrying guns and waving flags and keeping watch around the clock until the end of the month along a 23-mile stretch of the border.
[00:18:23.578 --> 00:18:30.980]  Volunteers reportedly are intimidating illegal aliens with their presence and alerting the Border Patrol via cell phones and radios when they see people crossing.
[00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:49.897]  Deacon said that with about 15,000 citizens saying they want to serve the civilian homeland defense, as the group calls it, plans to return in October across the entire southern border if the politicians are able to do the very basic thing that we've already proved can be done.
[00:18:50.911 --> 00:18:51.972]  So they're documenting that.
[00:18:52.433 --> 00:19:05.966]  Deacons of the Project also will expand into America itself to pressure the businesses that employ illegal workers utilizing picketing and advertising campaigns and to contact with businesses and their communities.
[00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:09.470]  We'll cover more of this later after we take calls after this break.
[00:19:10.134 --> 00:19:12.776]  Also, Christians challenge Pennsylvania hate law.
[00:19:13.297 --> 00:19:19.242]  They were facing 45 years in prison for peacefully praying on the street corner, but they defeated that in court.
[00:19:19.783 --> 00:19:27.569]  Now they're moving to overturn the unconstitutional law that Pennsylvania passed a couple years ago, thanks to the Republican governor.
[00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:30.272]  As usual, it's always Republicans.
[00:19:30.932 --> 00:19:32.754]  And so that's some good news there as well.
[00:19:33.315 --> 00:19:33.575]  U.S.
[00:19:33.635 --> 00:19:37.098]  forces abuse and torture female detainees in Iraq.
[00:19:38.943 --> 00:19:43.864]  Scandal of the Psychopath Knife Man Freed to Kill Four Times More.
[00:19:45.905 --> 00:19:49.465]  Again, the 93 12-year anniversary of Waco.
[00:19:49.986 --> 00:19:52.386]  The 95 10-year anniversary of Oklahoma City.
[00:19:53.746 --> 00:19:55.907]  So much more, but first, your calls.
[00:19:57.107 --> 00:19:59.368]  When we get back, stay with us.
[00:20:02.795 --> 00:20:05.377]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[00:20:05.837 --> 00:20:13.402]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[00:20:13.782 --> 00:20:17.485]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[00:20:17.905 --> 00:20:18.445]  We're good to go.

[00:20:54.352 --> 00:20:54.592]  That's 866-371-2330.
[00:21:01.059 --> 00:21:04.341]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:04.381 --> 00:21:08.584]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:08.824 --> 00:21:11.606]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:11.806 --> 00:21:14.207]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:23.052]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:23.233 --> 00:21:24.593]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:21:24.773 --> 00:21:28.916]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[00:21:28.976 --> 00:21:31.458]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:59.262 --> 00:22:04.654]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:22:04.974 --> 00:22:05.976]  The real money folks.
[00:22:09.271 --> 00:22:12.675]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:22:12.755 --> 00:22:14.618]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300, a 5% increase.
[00:22:15.218 --> 00:22:21.285]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:22:30.538 --> 00:22:36.163]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:22:36.783 --> 00:22:39.806]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:22:40.366 --> 00:22:45.511]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:46.812 --> 00:22:50.735]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:22:51.416 --> 00:22:54.358]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:22:54.799 --> 00:22:56.220]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.027 --> 00:23:03.389]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:23:03.629 --> 00:23:07.473]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:23:07.793 --> 00:23:08.614]  Read the labels.
[00:23:09.034 --> 00:23:13.198]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:13.398 --> 00:23:17.582]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:23:17.962 --> 00:23:22.827]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:23:23.207 --> 00:23:26.790]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:32.314]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:23:32.594 --> 00:23:35.336]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:23:35.616 --> 00:23:36.517]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:23:36.817 --> 00:23:47.565]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:23:49.366 --> 00:23:50.327]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[00:23:50.367 --> 00:23:51.088]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:23:51.108 --> 00:23:52.369]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.209 --> 00:24:20.252]  Of course, I put this in Road to Journey three years ago, but here it is in USA Today.
[00:24:20.713 --> 00:24:23.976]  Students paid for titling on peers, and they say it's just a wonderful idea.
[00:24:23.996 --> 00:24:29.660]  Oh, there's just so much news here that we're going to be going over.
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.982]  Surprise, surprise, new big medical studies.
[00:24:32.302 --> 00:24:36.566]  Being happy makes you have better health, a better immune system, and helps you live longer.
[00:24:37.146 --> 00:24:37.807]  So be happy!
[00:24:39.137 --> 00:24:41.658]  Let's go ahead and take some of your calls.
[00:24:41.898 --> 00:24:45.619]  Scott in Michigan, then Carlos, John, Greg, John, and others.
[00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:46.479]  Go ahead, Scott.
[00:24:47.079 --> 00:24:47.379]  Thank you.
[00:24:47.419 --> 00:24:48.559]  Alex, how are you doing today, sir?
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.280]  Pretty good.
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:50.060]  All right.
[00:24:50.100 --> 00:24:52.901]  Well, it's okay if I stress a theory on here?
[00:24:53.641 --> 00:24:53.881]  Sure.
[00:24:54.141 --> 00:24:54.941]  It's free speech.
[00:24:55.081 --> 00:24:55.781]  Say whatever you want.
[00:24:56.061 --> 00:24:56.361]  Okay.
[00:24:56.421 --> 00:25:01.943]  I mean, it's not documented proof of what you always show for your stuff, but you know about pro wrestling, right?
[00:25:03.723 --> 00:25:04.844]  Yes, I do know about pro wrestling.
[00:25:04.864 --> 00:25:06.404]  Classic man, multi-billionaire, all that stuff?
[00:25:07.079 --> 00:25:12.463]  Well, his company obviously demoralizes children, and I was one of those kids who was demoralized when I was a little 8-year-old kid.
[00:25:14.404 --> 00:25:16.786]  But, uh, anyways... How old are you now?
[00:25:17.146 --> 00:25:17.407]  What?
[00:25:18.187 --> 00:25:19.568]  How old are you now?
[00:25:20.229 --> 00:25:23.831]  14 years old, so it was 6 years ago when he really demoralized me with his programs.
[00:25:24.892 --> 00:25:32.678]  But if you look at every single thing that he's created on his television show, I mean, it's kind of... The parallels that go with the Illuminati, the New World Order, it's kind of hard to ignore it.
[00:25:33.231 --> 00:25:37.838]  You've got the Four Horsemen, you've got the New World Order, you've got all these people, yeah.
[00:25:38.218 --> 00:25:40.241]  Yeah, they've got all those elite groups and stuff like that.
[00:25:40.862 --> 00:25:45.108]  He just twists it into thinking that, so people try not to make the same connection with it.
[00:25:45.588 --> 00:25:49.333]  I get emails every week, why do you talk about a New World Order?
[00:25:49.374 --> 00:25:50.355]  That's pro wrestling.
[00:25:51.690 --> 00:25:54.491]  Yeah, pro wrestling doesn't do the exact same thing.
[00:25:54.971 --> 00:25:56.812]  Adolf Hitler talked about a new world order.
[00:25:56.912 --> 00:25:57.712]  Stalin did.
[00:25:57.732 --> 00:25:59.473]  Roosevelt did.
[00:25:59.493 --> 00:26:03.515]  We had people like Woodrow Wilson talk about it.
[00:26:03.595 --> 00:26:04.455]  Bush Sr.
[00:26:05.456 --> 00:26:06.316]  World leaders.
[00:26:06.596 --> 00:26:07.116]  The Pope.
[00:26:07.496 --> 00:26:10.478]  But no, when you talk about it to the general public, they think it's wrestling.
[00:26:11.018 --> 00:26:11.218]  Yeah.
[00:26:11.818 --> 00:26:15.620]  And also, too, what I noticed is that last year they held a pay-per-view called No Mercy.
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:18.981]  Now, Vince McMahon is part of the creative team and they create wrestling symbols.
[00:26:19.617 --> 00:26:23.318]  He created the No Mercy symbol, and in it had the all-seeing eye of the Illuminati.
[00:26:23.859 --> 00:26:26.960]  Well, that's kind of hard proof evidence that he's in it right there.
[00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:30.961]  I mean, how in the heck are you going to use the all-seeing eye of the Illuminati for a wrestling show?
[00:26:31.522 --> 00:26:32.102]  No, I hear you.
[00:26:32.142 --> 00:26:33.062]  I appreciate the call.
[00:26:33.102 --> 00:26:45.007]  But then you've got people like Oliver Stone, who makes Any Given Sunday, and the teams are the Aztecs, the Knights, and their symbols are the Red Crosses.
[00:26:45.942 --> 00:26:48.423]  And the all-seeing eyes, the electricity coming out.
[00:26:49.003 --> 00:26:50.583]  He's trying to expose it there.
[00:26:51.163 --> 00:26:54.324]  But definitely, I don't watch that theater.
[00:26:55.564 --> 00:26:58.325]  I've watched it a few times, maybe in the last ten years.
[00:26:58.365 --> 00:27:01.405]  And when I do watch it, it's, we need to torture and kill people in Iraq.
[00:27:01.905 --> 00:27:02.946]  They're all terrorists.
[00:27:02.966 --> 00:27:05.746]  I actually saw that where they give little political speeches.
[00:27:06.766 --> 00:27:08.527]  And the New World Order is unstoppable.
[00:27:08.547 --> 00:27:09.827]  They will dominate you.
[00:27:09.907 --> 00:27:13.628]  And the all-seeing eyes and SS Thunderbolts and...
[00:27:14.816 --> 00:27:23.581]  Half-naked women dancing around, and it teaches the children how to be little... It's quite berserker, very demonic in its whole overtone.
[00:27:25.082 --> 00:27:28.904]  And, yes, I would say that's very controlled in pitching a political message.
[00:27:29.744 --> 00:27:32.786]  I mean, in this age of propaganda, what is it on television?
[00:27:33.826 --> 00:27:43.111]  I was on the airplane, right, you know, in the aisle seat, looking at a guy catty-corner in front of me who watched two and a half hours of 24.
[00:27:45.876 --> 00:27:47.637]  So I got to watch a whole bunch of episodes of 24.
[00:27:47.757 --> 00:27:53.239]  Normally I was going to read, but instead I sat there and watched it like a silent movie.
[00:27:54.379 --> 00:27:56.620]  And all the homeless people are evil terrorists.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.361]  Everybody's a terrorist that's going to kill you.
[00:27:58.781 --> 00:28:00.182]  Torturing people is good.
[00:28:02.983 --> 00:28:08.665]  It was the same message of the few other times I've seen it.
[00:28:09.426 --> 00:28:10.466]  It was the same thing again.
[00:28:11.363 --> 00:28:19.406]  And watching it without the sound showed me even more, in many respects, some of the more subtler wrinkles in it.
[00:28:20.326 --> 00:28:39.592]  But the reason I talk about so-called professional wrestling is as a parallel to politics, where John Kerry and George Bush are cousins, members of the same group in business together in many different areas, and they have fake fights, fake elections.
[00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:43.470]  Because you just can't steal the election via the electronic voting machines.
[00:28:43.910 --> 00:28:50.893]  You have to have then a candidate who won't challenge that fraudulent election and enter John Kerry stage left.
[00:28:52.453 --> 00:28:59.676]  And just like there are millions of adults in America and even more children who think wrestling is real, I don't mean Greco-Roman wrestling at the Olympics.
[00:28:59.736 --> 00:29:00.396]  That is real.
[00:29:00.476 --> 00:29:04.377]  I mean that thing they call pro-wrestling on TV.
[00:29:04.918 --> 00:29:05.838]  They believe it's real.
[00:29:06.539 --> 00:29:10.260]  And they will argue with you, and since I'm talking about it, I will get emails today.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:11.160]  I always do.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:18.222]  Some of them quite threatening that wrestling is real, and how dare you say it's not real.
[00:29:19.562 --> 00:29:20.963]  And, I mean, really, it's comical.
[00:29:22.063 --> 00:29:25.264]  Back when I did watch TV, I would occasionally stop on it for ten minutes and watch it.
[00:29:25.304 --> 00:29:26.724]  I mean, it's very ridiculous.
[00:29:29.385 --> 00:29:30.245]  It's clownish.
[00:29:31.205 --> 00:29:34.766]  But tens of millions of Americans believe it's real.
[00:29:35.595 --> 00:29:40.239]  It's like tens of millions of Americans believe presidential-level politics are real.
[00:29:40.779 --> 00:29:44.502]  Folks, I'm here to tell you, it's as real as the WWF.
[00:29:44.662 --> 00:29:49.125]  All right, we're going to hurry a little bit faster with your calls when we get back.
[00:29:49.145 --> 00:29:51.667]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:52.608]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.108 --> 00:29:54.709]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:58.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.678 --> 00:30:09.183]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.584 --> 00:30:13.828]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.068 --> 00:30:21.095]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.475 --> 00:30:27.581]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.601 --> 00:30:28.942]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.122 --> 00:30:29.583]  We're good to go.
[00:30:46.042 --> 00:30:49.187]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:30:49.207 --> 00:30:49.267]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.287 --> 00:30:49.327]  866-885-6625.
[00:30:49.547 --> 00:30:50.489]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:50.709]  Call today.
[00:31:01.067 --> 00:31:09.329]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.589 --> 00:31:13.950]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:23.132]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.352 --> 00:31:26.953]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.273 --> 00:31:32.299]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.599 --> 00:31:39.347]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.

[00:32:00.729 --> 00:32:04.434]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:32:04.714 --> 00:32:09.019]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:32:09.239 --> 00:32:16.188]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:32:16.568 --> 00:32:23.213]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza socks, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:32:23.513 --> 00:32:26.976]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioOx citrus concentrate.
[00:32:26.996 --> 00:32:27.777]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.

[00:32:46.228 --> 00:32:50.911]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:32:51.091 --> 00:32:53.612]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:32:53.772 --> 00:32:58.435]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[00:33:14.688 --> 00:33:18.310]  You have found the coordinates.
[00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:24.053]  You have stumbled into the information war, the tip of the spear.
[00:33:27.335 --> 00:33:38.981]  You have found a location where we are defending this republic from enemies foreign and domestic, where we are defending liberty, resisting tyranny, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:39.441 --> 00:33:40.281]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:40.862 --> 00:33:43.043]  Central Standard Time back from 9 to midnight.
[00:33:44.033 --> 00:33:45.714]  This is the information war.
[00:33:45.774 --> 00:33:48.416]  There is a war on for your mind.
[00:33:48.476 --> 00:33:50.898]  Hence InfoWars.com.
[00:33:50.978 --> 00:33:53.840]  We are in a fight for civilization.
[00:33:53.900 --> 00:34:03.106]  We are blasting holes in the lies and the iron curtain of the global crime syndicate, also known as the New World Order.
[00:34:04.107 --> 00:34:09.410]  Their program of globalization is nothing more than worldwide slavery.
[00:34:10.171 --> 00:34:11.632]  A pandemic...
[00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:16.423]  Straightjacket or reservation or plantation.
[00:34:17.784 --> 00:34:20.145]  Neo-feudal serfdom.
[00:34:21.706 --> 00:34:25.729]  Under the auspices of a techno-security grid.
[00:34:28.171 --> 00:34:31.533]  My friends, how can you call George Bush a conservative?
[00:34:31.974 --> 00:34:34.215]  A $2.6 trillion budget.
[00:34:35.436 --> 00:34:38.338]  Another $600 plus billion off budget.
[00:34:39.379 --> 00:34:39.639]  That's $3,200,000,000,000
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:49.963]  Bill Clinton's biggest budget, counting off-budget expenditures, was $1.8 trillion.
[00:34:51.044 --> 00:34:59.708]  Bush has appointed nothing but anti-gun minions to federal courts, to cabinet positions in his White House.
[00:35:01.049 --> 00:35:10.534]  He is dismantling the Bill of Rights and Constitution, dismantling the dollar, allowing the scam of
[00:35:11.343 --> 00:35:16.345]  The peak oil fraud to be perpetrated, not allowing us to have the oil out of Alaska.
[00:35:16.725 --> 00:35:21.107]  We'll put on an act like he's fighting for it, but then lose a battle he could win instantly.
[00:35:21.587 --> 00:35:30.971]  Won't let us have the oil out of the Gulf of Mexico, whole areas, thousands of square miles off limits with the greatest oil fields ever known.
[00:35:33.112 --> 00:35:34.332]  It's just all happening.
[00:35:35.613 --> 00:35:36.533]  It's all happening.
[00:35:38.377 --> 00:35:43.058]  And the Democrats are totally controlled, happily going along with the entire program.
[00:35:43.818 --> 00:35:46.439]  We're about to go to Carlos and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:35:46.459 --> 00:36:01.862]  And then I'm going to jump right back into this huge stack of very important news, including the 12th anniversary of the Waco tragedy, an abomination, and mass murder by Butcher Waco Reno, Butcher Reno for short.
[00:36:03.317 --> 00:36:05.898]  And then, of course, we'll get into the 10-year anniversary.
[00:36:05.978 --> 00:36:07.098]  Already 10 years.
[00:36:07.799 --> 00:36:10.840]  10 years and, what, 3 hours.
[00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:24.145]  3 hours and 34 minutes, to be precise, Central Standard Time, since the New World Order blew up most of that building in downtown Oklahoma City, the Alfred P. Murrah Building.
[00:36:25.865 --> 00:36:30.747]  But before we go to your calls, listen, we've got these t-shirts in.
[00:36:32.381 --> 00:36:34.002]  We've been offering them now for a week.
[00:36:34.823 --> 00:36:35.583]  They're very simple.
[00:36:35.603 --> 00:36:36.664]  They're very elegant.
[00:36:37.305 --> 00:36:41.788]  They get the message across without being too loud.
[00:36:42.148 --> 00:36:47.051]  Some of you might not want to wear, say, one of my shirts that say, Mass murderers agree.
[00:36:47.572 --> 00:36:48.713]  Gun control works.
[00:36:49.253 --> 00:36:51.134]  With a picture of Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[00:36:51.935 --> 00:36:54.096]  And then under it, Infowars.com.
[00:36:54.137 --> 00:36:57.279]  On the back, politicians love disarmed peasants.
[00:37:00.259 --> 00:37:03.622]  I mean, a lot of people are so stupid they'll see that shirt.
[00:37:04.163 --> 00:37:08.126]  It's a good conversation piece and think, oh, you must be for Hitler, Stalin, and Mao.
[00:37:09.167 --> 00:37:11.289]  Because you're wearing a shirt.
[00:37:11.589 --> 00:37:12.970]  Because, I mean, that's how dumbed down they are.
[00:37:13.951 --> 00:37:18.495]  The Tyranny Response Team shirt is dark blue with yellow letters, kind of like a firefighter's shirt.
[00:37:18.515 --> 00:37:21.118]  It says Tyranny Response Team on the right-hand shoulder.
[00:37:21.818 --> 00:37:23.060]  Infowars.com.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:23.780]  Very nice.
[00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:26.723]  We've been offering those for about three years, three and a half years.
[00:37:27.856 --> 00:37:29.597]  But now we're offering three new shirts.
[00:37:29.757 --> 00:37:34.460]  One of them is an artist's rendering of Arnold Schwarzenegger looking like a dictator.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:36.301]  Under it, it says, Obey.
[00:37:36.921 --> 00:37:39.343]  Resist the foreign usurper.
[00:37:39.843 --> 00:37:41.024]  ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:37:41.064 --> 00:37:45.066]  On the back, it says, Say no to Arnold for president.
[00:37:45.226 --> 00:37:46.607]  Infowars.com.
[00:37:48.128 --> 00:37:49.148]  ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:37:49.789 --> 00:37:51.249]  And then we also have women's shirts.
[00:37:51.289 --> 00:37:52.550]  You know, tight-fitting tanks.
[00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:53.751]  My wife's wearing one today.
[00:37:54.728 --> 00:38:00.210]  It looks great in black and white with InfoWars.com across the chest.
[00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:05.471]  Very nice.
[00:38:05.931 --> 00:38:07.372]  These are designer shirts.
[00:38:07.832 --> 00:38:10.553]  And they're made in America.
[00:38:10.573 --> 00:38:13.293]  The cotton's grown here.
[00:38:13.473 --> 00:38:16.034]  The shirts are stitched here.
[00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.355]  They are pressed right here in Austin.
[00:38:19.615 --> 00:38:22.596]  And that just says InfoWars.com across the chest.
[00:38:24.051 --> 00:38:30.234]  Then we have, for men and women, this new t-shirt that is a George Arwell quote.
[00:38:30.374 --> 00:38:35.497]  In an age of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:38:36.437 --> 00:38:40.579]  And it just says that on the front, and then under it, George Arwell, small.
[00:38:40.959 --> 00:38:47.682]  On the back it says, LearnTheTruthInfoWars.com Great way to meet like-minded people.
[00:38:48.303 --> 00:38:50.924]  Great way to get involved in your community.
[00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:56.771]  But it's not so loud as you're almost embarrassed to wear it.
[00:38:57.291 --> 00:39:01.333]  Sometimes I'm wearing that Hitler-Stalin-Mann shirt and people are staring at it.
[00:39:02.033 --> 00:39:03.614]  Sometimes I get too many questions.
[00:39:05.074 --> 00:39:05.835]  We're good to go.
[00:39:26.847 --> 00:39:28.708]  And the power behind the throne.
[00:39:28.728 --> 00:39:30.890]  1-888- to get the new video or any of the t-shirts.
[00:39:30.910 --> 00:39:31.030]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:31.090]  888-253-3139.
[00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.412]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:39:55.203 --> 00:39:58.804]  Or order via the safe, secure shopping cart at InfoWars.com.
[00:39:59.564 --> 00:40:06.486]  And we've got about half of Martial Law now on the website for free if you want to go watch it, and then hopefully order it so you can make high-quality copies.
[00:40:07.346 --> 00:40:10.928]  This film will not have a big effect unless you get it, unless you make copies.
[00:40:10.948 --> 00:40:11.848]  So please do that.
[00:40:12.248 --> 00:40:13.148]  You've got the power.
[00:40:13.948 --> 00:40:18.610]  And the globalists can't stop the run when you take action, when you start moving down the field.
[00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:21.230]  So don't wait for orders from headquarters.
[00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:22.991]  Get this video and start making copies.
[00:40:23.644 --> 00:40:28.306]  Hey, Alex, it's great to hear this 15-year-old that the new world order is refreshing, you know?
[00:40:28.326 --> 00:40:28.726]  14, yeah.
[00:40:28.866 --> 00:40:28.966]  Yeah.
[00:40:52.048 --> 00:40:54.149]  But anyway, a couple of different topics real quick.
[00:40:54.169 --> 00:40:56.591]  You were talking about outsourcing to China.
[00:40:57.151 --> 00:40:59.172]  Mexico's already running scared.
[00:40:59.673 --> 00:41:05.496]  China's already making sombreros, sarapes, and some of the Mexican guitars.
[00:41:05.616 --> 00:41:07.978]  I tell you, they're taking business away from Mexico.
[00:41:08.438 --> 00:41:09.839]  They're getting scared over there.
[00:41:09.999 --> 00:41:15.082]  Well, that's the plan, and everybody wants... Look, the 10-year NAFTA plan was one way.
[00:41:15.908 --> 00:41:21.130]  America still had to jump through hoops and still had to pay tariffs and be regulated.
[00:41:21.210 --> 00:41:25.572]  Quote, it was going to be renegotiated in 2004.
[00:41:26.153 --> 00:41:28.594]  And basically, the deal is still the same.
[00:41:28.934 --> 00:41:35.437]  So now Mexico and Latin America is getting a taste, and I've read that it's wildly unpopular.
[00:41:36.097 --> 00:41:37.578]  NAFTA is in Latin America.
[00:41:37.878 --> 00:41:42.920]  But if you think that's bad, folks, wait until we get the free trade area of the Americas.
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:46.381]  Exactly, Alex.
[00:41:46.501 --> 00:42:12.558]  Now on a different topic, today's April the 19th, and a lot of researchers claim that the New World Order is obsessed with numbers, names, terms, and on April 19th, remember we have the Corish incident in Waco, we also had Oklahoma, we also had the Columbine murders, and April the 19th happens to be a paganist festival day, a bloodbath day,
[00:42:13.226 --> 00:42:15.647]  To the God, Son, God, Ball, B-A-L.
[00:42:15.828 --> 00:42:17.849]  No, that's in the encyclopedia.
[00:42:17.969 --> 00:42:23.712]  Also in 1775, Lexington and Concord, they're at the Commons.
[00:42:24.433 --> 00:42:27.755]  People think the founding fathers started the war then because they were occultic.
[00:42:27.795 --> 00:42:28.956]  Certainly some were, but no.
[00:42:29.256 --> 00:42:31.077]  The British thought it was fortuitous.
[00:42:31.737 --> 00:42:38.862]  They were even more occultic to start the war, to go have a massacre, to confiscate guns on that day.
[00:42:38.882 --> 00:42:39.782]  Hitler's birthday...
[00:42:42.512 --> 00:42:44.072]  Well, you know, Alex, there's more than meets the eye.
[00:42:44.232 --> 00:42:45.833]  People probably see no relevance between the three events
[00:43:09.932 --> 00:43:10.813]  That I just mentioned.
[00:43:10.853 --> 00:43:12.874]  But look at the murderous Columbine.
[00:43:13.595 --> 00:43:19.640]  The word Columbine very likely is derived from the sun goddess Columbia.
[00:43:20.581 --> 00:43:22.543]  Now, that's what we have... Well, it's not likely.
[00:43:22.603 --> 00:43:28.788]  I mean, that's what America and the District of Columbia and all of it... Yeah, no, that's from the sun god.
[00:43:28.828 --> 00:43:31.390]  And then Europe is Europa.
[00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:36.194]  And the symbol for the EU is the woman being raped by Zeus the Bull.
[00:43:37.287 --> 00:43:49.435]  Well, you know, we also have things like Columbia Broadcasting Company, Columbia Pictures, Columbia University, the District of Columbia, a country named Columbia.
[00:43:50.416 --> 00:43:52.137]  All these things are not accidental.
[00:43:52.157 --> 00:43:59.341]  That shows the influence and power that the Paganists, the New World Order has on our society.
[00:44:00.182 --> 00:44:03.324]  When we mention that we are funded on Christian principles, well,
[00:44:03.968 --> 00:44:05.288]  It's partially true.
[00:44:05.828 --> 00:44:09.449]  If we look around, we're going to see a lot of paganist symbols out there, too.
[00:44:09.469 --> 00:44:10.209]  No, you're right.
[00:44:10.229 --> 00:44:11.670]  We just don't know what they are.
[00:44:11.790 --> 00:44:13.110]  Carlos, you're absolutely right.
[00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.670]  Anything else?
[00:44:15.190 --> 00:44:15.910]  That'll be it, buddy.
[00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:16.811]  Just keep up the fight.
[00:44:17.131 --> 00:44:17.411]  All right.
[00:44:17.451 --> 00:44:19.771]  Always good to hear from you whenever you call once a month.
[00:44:19.811 --> 00:44:20.791]  He always has good points.
[00:44:20.831 --> 00:44:24.672]  We always enjoy hearing from Carlos in California.
[00:44:25.932 --> 00:44:27.473]  Listening to us on a great affiliate out there.
[00:44:27.513 --> 00:44:29.233]  We really appreciate it.
[00:44:29.373 --> 00:44:29.633]  Listen.
[00:44:32.438 --> 00:44:36.842]  About a third of the Founding Fathers were Luciferian.
[00:44:37.963 --> 00:44:38.703]  Yes, it's true.
[00:44:39.904 --> 00:44:40.445]  I've studied it.
[00:44:40.725 --> 00:44:49.392]  But the claim that they were all these theists or deists, that they were all under the occult is patently false.
[00:44:49.532 --> 00:44:58.539]  The driving force, the predominant force, and the occultists tried to control it, tried to get us a king, and tried to mess everything up.
[00:44:58.559 --> 00:44:59.400]  They almost succeeded.
[00:45:00.836 --> 00:45:06.180]  But two-thirds were what you would call in modern terms, rabid Christians.
[00:45:07.561 --> 00:45:12.905]  No king but King Jesus was the chant, led by the Black Brigade, the pastors and priests.
[00:45:14.366 --> 00:45:15.367]  And I've looked at the facts.
[00:45:15.968 --> 00:45:21.832]  And then of that third that were masons and occultists, I mean, a real occultist was Benjamin Franklin.
[00:45:22.312 --> 00:45:25.074]  Somebody who was just low-level was our...
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.441]  Founding father, the founding father, George Washington.
[00:45:29.702 --> 00:45:32.043]  And he wrote letters decrying it when he found out about it.
[00:45:34.244 --> 00:45:36.386]  I mean, again, most Masons are not bad.
[00:45:36.406 --> 00:45:37.346]  I'm going to tell you straight up.
[00:45:38.647 --> 00:45:40.908]  They are part of an occult organization, but they don't know.
[00:45:40.928 --> 00:45:42.429]  It's like most police aren't bad.
[00:45:42.669 --> 00:45:43.890]  They're compartmentalized.
[00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:46.111]  Most CIA agents aren't bad.
[00:45:46.812 --> 00:45:48.653]  Most FBI agents aren't bad.
[00:45:48.693 --> 00:45:50.654]  Their symbol is a pyramid for a reason.
[00:45:51.329 --> 00:45:52.689]  At the top, they're illuminated.
[00:45:52.709 --> 00:45:54.110]  At the top, they know what's going on.
[00:45:54.530 --> 00:46:02.292]  And then they've got all these low-level good people thinking they're part of, quote, the great work trying to help society, empowering this beast.
[00:46:03.032 --> 00:46:07.994]  The New World Order is based on telling a lie and getting good people to believe it and going along with it.
[00:46:09.554 --> 00:46:11.295]  And then it's driven also by fear.
[00:46:12.295 --> 00:46:16.796]  And fear keeps you, to quote P.K.D., Philip K. Dickey, it's true.
[00:46:16.816 --> 00:46:19.077]  I mean, I've said this many times instinctively, but...
[00:46:20.373 --> 00:46:22.795]  When I was in L.A., Sunday night, I went to a play.
[00:46:24.536 --> 00:46:25.416]  Oh, what's the name of it?
[00:46:26.157 --> 00:46:27.798]  Blow My Tears, the policeman said.
[00:46:27.818 --> 00:46:28.779]  It was excellent.
[00:46:29.199 --> 00:46:32.201]  But there were so many things said there that I agreed with.
[00:46:32.541 --> 00:46:39.986]  And the quote was, because I don't want to plagiarize this, the quote was, Fear keeps you from fully committing to life.
[00:46:41.708 --> 00:46:45.770]  And many people have said that those that are afraid don't truly live.
[00:46:47.812 --> 00:46:49.453]  Until you're willing to lay down your life...
[00:46:50.069 --> 00:46:51.090]  You're not really alive.
[00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.931]  And that's totally true.
[00:46:52.951 --> 00:46:54.092]  I want to talk more about that later.
[00:46:54.552 --> 00:46:56.073]  John in Canada, welcome.
[00:46:56.493 --> 00:46:57.254]  Alex, how are you doing?
[00:46:57.554 --> 00:46:57.774]  Good.
[00:46:58.275 --> 00:46:58.615]  Excellent.
[00:46:58.655 --> 00:47:02.217]  Yeah, what you were just saying, boy, you know, you're right on the button there.
[00:47:02.377 --> 00:47:03.838]  I agree with you completely.
[00:47:03.858 --> 00:47:09.522]  You know, I think there are probably many effective strategies to defeat the mechanisms of tyranny.
[00:47:11.363 --> 00:47:12.624]  But I've got a couple ideas.
[00:47:12.864 --> 00:47:18.128]  I mean, if we could understand why justice is so important to protect our freedoms...
[00:47:18.752 --> 00:47:21.573]  And your listeners could engage the media themselves.
[00:47:21.693 --> 00:47:23.313]  I mean, it's great what you're doing.
[00:47:23.353 --> 00:47:25.194]  You're doing a phenomenal thing for us here.
[00:47:26.054 --> 00:47:27.834]  But the listeners there have to get involved.
[00:47:27.914 --> 00:47:30.075]  I'm doing nothing until you take action.
[00:47:30.375 --> 00:47:31.035]  Right, exactly.
[00:47:31.055 --> 00:47:31.835]  That is the link.
[00:47:32.035 --> 00:47:37.216]  And in the case of 9-11, I mean, if we want to arrest these guys, we can do it.
[00:47:37.577 --> 00:47:40.797]  I mean, my case, my particular story, I called you a little while ago.
[00:47:40.817 --> 00:47:43.998]  I had the Secret Service pressure to have me arrested top-secretly.
[00:47:44.278 --> 00:47:47.719]  But it didn't work because there is honorable police officers involved.
[00:47:48.050 --> 00:47:48.911]  Around the world.
[00:47:48.991 --> 00:47:51.512]  I mean, most police officers want to do the right thing.
[00:47:51.952 --> 00:48:00.436]  And they can try top secret to get you incarcerated indefinitely and have you disappear, but they've got to find a whole bunch of corrupted police officers to cooperate.
[00:48:00.456 --> 00:48:08.120]  That's why through the sitcoms and the dramas and TV, they're promoting this as evil as if it's good, so good cops watch that.
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.621]  And listen, I've called it propaganda.
[00:48:10.353 --> 00:48:10.893]  We're good to go.
[00:48:10.913 --> 00:48:11.454]  We're good to go.
[00:48:30.319 --> 00:48:40.223]  And see, these judge shows, where it's always one judge, no jury, that's training America, and a lot of these are federally funded, that we don't have juries.
[00:48:40.343 --> 00:48:47.807]  See, people are being programmed by the fiction more than they're being programmed by so-called non-fiction.
[00:48:48.207 --> 00:48:50.608]  And in particular, just that you mentioned juries,
[00:48:51.008 --> 00:48:52.570]  That's my defense.
[00:48:52.650 --> 00:48:57.214]  I've demanded that I have a jury, and the whole case is falling apart.
[00:48:57.555 --> 00:49:09.046]  But what I've been doing, and I've talked to you a couple weeks ago about this, but the thing is, if you're committed to arresting those from 9-11, and nobody anywhere in America disagrees with the FBI's official findings,
[00:49:09.386 --> 00:49:11.927]  Well, General Ahmed, as you said, wired $100,000 to Mohammed Adda.
[00:49:11.967 --> 00:49:12.287]  He came to...
[00:49:29.335 --> 00:49:34.297]  Yeah, I put that together with the fact that also General Ahmad was also sent to the Taliban to tell them that no evidence would be forthcoming.
[00:49:34.317 --> 00:49:35.057]  And also, I highlighted
[00:49:55.376 --> 00:50:06.102]  That Jim Michalewski at MSNBC News was provided the top secret presidential directive documents from Condoleezza Rice's office, dated September 9th.
[00:50:06.442 --> 00:50:07.703]  Nobody was supposed to see this.
[00:50:08.003 --> 00:50:10.625]  He was supposed to be on vacation without a care in the world at that time.
[00:50:11.232 --> 00:50:15.695]  But those documents outlined their top secret invasion of Afghanistan strategy.
[00:50:15.715 --> 00:50:18.476]  Well, that's been in probably 100 major newspapers.
[00:50:18.516 --> 00:50:22.799]  Bush signed the launch orders for the war, had them on his desk two days before.
[00:50:23.059 --> 00:50:30.103]  Right, and the thing about it is it's all about using no evidence as a prerequisite guarantee to get into Afghanistan.
[00:50:30.143 --> 00:50:37.787]  They figure, you know, if we give no evidence, whether Bin Laden does anything bad or not, he's going to plead not guilty and we can go in there and bomb the country.
[00:50:38.533 --> 00:50:40.915]  But as a result, they're not following the crime scene leads.
[00:50:40.955 --> 00:50:42.636]  They're not arresting General Ackman.
[00:50:42.676 --> 00:50:48.140]  Well, I mean, FBI agents have gone on the National Press Club and said, here's the letter.
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:49.200]  I've been threatened with arrest.
[00:50:49.241 --> 00:50:55.845]  If I tell you what I know, by the FBI, all I can tell you is the Bushes vacation with the Bin Ladens.
[00:50:57.046 --> 00:50:57.887]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.907 --> 00:50:58.307]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.374 --> 00:51:05.723]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.903 --> 00:51:10.332]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.473 --> 00:51:11.635]  There is a chance.
[00:51:13.287 --> 00:51:16.291]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:18.012 --> 00:51:22.257]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.297 --> 00:51:29.245]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.365 --> 00:51:31.387]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.627 --> 00:51:42.131]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.351 --> 00:51:47.733]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:26.294 --> 00:52:38.063]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.543 --> 00:52:43.008]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:54:19.345 --> 00:54:21.006]  Let's continue with your calls.
[00:54:21.546 --> 00:54:24.168]  Let's talk to Greg in Texas.
[00:54:24.248 --> 00:54:25.108]  Greg, thanks for holding.
[00:54:25.129 --> 00:54:25.589]  Go ahead.
[00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:26.769]  Stop it, Alex.
[00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:27.650]  Just stop it.
[00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:31.532]  I'm calling you to, you know, please stop glorifying the Nazi.
[00:54:32.493 --> 00:54:38.078]  You know, the term you use, no to the usurper or tyrannical response team is great.
[00:54:38.418 --> 00:54:45.103]  But, you know, our sleeping dumbed down minds can't disassociate when you include the word president in the same sentence.
[00:54:46.384 --> 00:54:47.085]  You understand what I'm saying?
[00:54:47.445 --> 00:54:47.605]  Yes.
[00:54:47.625 --> 00:54:51.488]  On the website, there's a picture of the White House and the flag.
[00:54:51.969 --> 00:54:54.351]  When I first saw it, I'm thinking patriotism.
[00:54:55.271 --> 00:54:57.193]  So I'm just asking you to address patriotism.
[00:54:58.106 --> 00:54:59.087]  That aspect.
[00:55:00.207 --> 00:55:00.507]  Thanks.
[00:55:00.547 --> 00:55:01.388]  Thanks for all your hard work, bro.
[00:55:02.048 --> 00:55:03.129]  Are you being serious?
[00:55:03.309 --> 00:55:04.050]  I'm being serious.
[00:55:04.830 --> 00:55:07.411]  Well, stay there then so I understand exactly what you're saying.
[00:55:07.952 --> 00:55:20.099]  On ArnoldExposed.com, on one side you have the White House and the American flag, and then facing the other direction you have Arnold giving the Hitler salute and a Nazi symbol.
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:23.522]  So it's clearly the two halves, the choice.
[00:55:23.982 --> 00:55:28.685]  This creature is threatening our government, our country, our nation.
[00:55:29.526 --> 00:55:31.307]  So I don't... Deeper, yes, I see that.
[00:55:31.688 --> 00:55:40.754]  But, you know, at first spot, and coming from, you know, preaching to the choir, it's easier to see, but others don't see it that way.
[00:55:40.934 --> 00:55:45.517]  It's like subconsciously, you know, the word president and Arnold in the same sentence is...
[00:55:46.027 --> 00:55:49.270]  Basically, any publicity is free publicity is good publicity.
[00:55:49.490 --> 00:55:50.390]  That isn't really true.
[00:55:50.450 --> 00:55:52.432]  They say that, but that isn't really true.
[00:55:52.452 --> 00:55:55.394]  Do you think Michael Jackson likes the publicity he's getting right now?
[00:55:55.774 --> 00:55:59.858]  He may not like it, but it's causing him more exposure.
[00:56:00.538 --> 00:56:03.020]  Actually, it's causing his records not to sell well.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.581]  It's causing him to fall apart.
[00:56:05.742 --> 00:56:08.704]  Look, we have to counter them.
[00:56:09.725 --> 00:56:11.987]  No one was challenging Schwarzenegger.
[00:56:12.587 --> 00:56:14.809]  No one was going up against him.
[00:56:15.958 --> 00:56:16.398]  Greg.
[00:56:17.139 --> 00:56:29.964]  And so now whenever they mention that there's a move to change the Constitution for Schwarzenegger, in most cases they've got to mention that there's a group against that, and they have to then give attention to our views, and then the dirt comes out.
[00:56:30.044 --> 00:56:30.645]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:31.185 --> 00:56:33.006]  Now he's being challenged.
[00:56:33.086 --> 00:56:40.409]  By the way, I said today, because we decided who the winners were on April 15th for the TV spot and the radio spot,
[00:56:41.587 --> 00:56:46.271]  But I want to air the spots here, and I wasn't ready for that today because I just got back into town last night.
[00:56:46.631 --> 00:56:48.333]  So I'll announce who the winners are tomorrow.
[00:56:49.374 --> 00:56:51.315]  I know it's bated breath out there.
[00:56:51.916 --> 00:56:55.839]  The winner of the video spot, and I've also got my own TV spot.
[00:56:55.879 --> 00:56:59.002]  That's the one we'll be airing because it doesn't have any copyright material in it.
[00:56:59.022 --> 00:57:01.904]  You have to be very careful about that for TV broadcast.
[00:57:02.805 --> 00:57:09.971]  But I'll be airing the ad that I made in California and Texas, and I'm making those buys this week.
[00:57:11.142 --> 00:57:18.186]  But on the websites, where they'll get even more viewers, we're going to post a lot of the video and audio ads we were sent.
[00:57:18.766 --> 00:57:24.149]  And it was hard choosing a winner, but we did choose one.
[00:57:25.070 --> 00:57:37.777]  And we've got a very interesting 60-second and 30-second ad already up at ArnoldExposed.com to give you an idea of some of the incredible entries we got.
[00:57:39.238 --> 00:57:39.358]  And
[00:57:40.808 --> 00:57:45.311]  So tomorrow, I just want to give justice to all these ads.
[00:57:46.793 --> 00:57:57.120]  I need to get them all basically put on the web first, because I'm in Texas, so the folks up in Minnesota running the broadcast can download them and play them on air for you tomorrow.
[00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:05.827]  So we'll be announcing who that winner is tomorrow, and I'll be mailing those two checks out tomorrow as well.
[00:58:07.092 --> 00:58:11.034]  We're going to break now because if I went to a call, it wouldn't give them enough time.
[00:58:11.054 --> 00:58:17.698]  When we come back, we'll talk to John in Tennessee, Jason in Maryland, Paul in New York, and many others that are patiently holding.
[00:58:18.098 --> 00:58:21.219]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:58:21.239 --> 00:58:30.144]  Coming up in 30 minutes, we do have the head spokesman, head coordinator for the Minutemen, now spreading to four states.
[00:58:31.081 --> 00:58:31.561]  Big Brother.
[00:58:31.581 --> 00:58:32.422]  Big Brother.
[00:59:01.433 --> 00:59:03.733]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.434 --> 00:59:06.354]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.374 --> 00:59:09.615]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.176 --> 00:59:14.317]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:25.640 --> 00:59:27.001]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:29.235 --> 00:59:35.417]  35 seconds into this second hour of transmission against tyranny right in the middle of the Infowar on the front lines.
[00:59:35.917 --> 00:59:36.937]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:59:36.957 --> 00:59:41.079]  We're going to continue with wide open phones in this hour, 800-259-9231.
[00:59:41.459 --> 00:59:56.643]  It is the anniversary of the start of the Revolutionary War against the British when they engaged in a mass murder-slaughter, murder-death-kill as they call it, up at the Boston Commons and at Lexington.
[00:59:57.722 --> 01:00:04.290]  And Concord, it's also the anniversary of Adolf Hitler's birth, and tomorrow is his death.
[01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:14.441]  And it's also the anniversary of the Waco mass murder, 12 years ago, 10 years ago, of Oklahoma City, and many other interesting things on April 19th.
[01:00:17.179 --> 01:00:27.668]  And I also have a bunch of news on the economy, on the police state, on Bush's approval rating, on China, on implantable microchips being promoted for the public, on this interesting story out of U.S.
[01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:34.753]  News & World Report, the CSI effect, how TV is driving jury verdicts all across America.
[01:00:34.854 --> 01:00:36.035]  I've always pointed this out.
[01:00:36.055 --> 01:00:37.436]  I've never seen anybody else point it out.
[01:00:37.916 --> 01:00:41.319]  And here they admit that TV basically controls what juries and grand juries do.
[01:00:41.999 --> 01:00:45.042]  So I do want to talk about that effect as well, and it is an effect.
[01:00:45.598 --> 01:00:47.278]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:00:48.139 --> 01:00:52.099]  Let's go ahead now and go to John in Tennessee.
[01:00:52.179 --> 01:00:52.960]  John, welcome.
[01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:53.960]  Hi, Alex.
[01:00:54.340 --> 01:00:54.600]  Hello.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:01:00.201]  Did you know that the FBI director of the Waco massacre was a former member of Waco City Council?
[01:01:02.262 --> 01:01:03.002]  I did not know that.
[01:01:03.542 --> 01:01:12.584]  Yeah, William Sessions, I heard this from a lawyer here in Knoxville, because Bill Sessions was a lawyer, hired by Bush Sr., fired by Bill Clinton after Waco,
[01:01:13.584 --> 01:01:16.305]  Yeah, and wasn't his daddy Sonny Sessions?
[01:01:17.145 --> 01:01:25.268]  I don't know about his dad, but this is just a big thing that the lawyers all know about, and they're amazed, of course, that nobody talks about it in the media.
[01:01:26.368 --> 01:01:34.211]  And it was all an operation set up under Bush Sr., and Clinton inherited it like JFK inherited Eisenhower.
[01:01:34.231 --> 01:01:35.251]  No, I know, that's true.
[01:01:35.311 --> 01:01:37.792]  I mean, that's admitted that two months before Bush Sr.
[01:01:37.832 --> 01:01:41.953]  left office, he'd already just gone off Ruby Ridge and wanted more.
[01:01:42.754 --> 01:01:43.474]  Well, I think Clinton gets
[01:02:07.456 --> 01:02:08.577]  He's a congressman now.
[01:02:08.597 --> 01:02:09.037]  Is he?
[01:02:09.057 --> 01:02:09.438]  I don't know.
[01:02:09.458 --> 01:02:10.338]  Yeah, I know that.
[01:02:10.418 --> 01:02:14.041]  He's a good crook, so he's got plenty of friends there he can hang out with.
[01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:16.483]  White Michael McCaul?
[01:02:33.919 --> 01:02:36.641]  Bill Frist is my favorite.
[01:02:36.721 --> 01:02:41.805]  He paid an $840 million fine for Medicare fraud and a bunch of his executives went to prison.
[01:02:42.265 --> 01:02:48.269]  So he gets promoted as a freshman senator to Speaker of the Senate.
[01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:49.010]  That's amazing.
[01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:59.797]  So he paid basically an $840 million bribe to become Speaker of the Senate and get all his health care programs through for his hospital corporation, which is the biggest in the world.
[01:03:00.766 --> 01:03:02.568]  Crest is a real piece of work.
[01:03:02.608 --> 01:03:05.110]  I guess you know about him from being in Tennessee.
[01:03:05.290 --> 01:03:15.779]  Yeah, and he bragged on C-SPAN it only cost $100,000 to kill... Well, it only cost a million dollars to kill 100,000 Americans with biological warfare.
[01:03:15.799 --> 01:03:17.341]  So he loves to read about that.
[01:03:18.161 --> 01:03:19.563]  Well, he's in good company.
[01:03:19.603 --> 01:03:23.046]  Dick Cheney says we need to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[01:03:23.466 --> 01:03:27.690]  Yeah, and Rabbi Dob Zachheim apparently wrote that document.
[01:03:28.433 --> 01:03:31.036]  Along with Jeb Bush and all the rest of them at FINAX.
[01:03:31.056 --> 01:03:34.920]  Yeah, and he's the guy who actually is over at the company that has the remote control, right?
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:36.461]  That's right.
[01:03:36.501 --> 01:03:37.042]  Nice fellow.
[01:03:39.564 --> 01:03:41.767]  Is Crawford, Texas Waco, Texas?
[01:03:42.087 --> 01:03:42.848]  Basically, yeah.
[01:03:43.769 --> 01:03:46.111]  That's amazing.
[01:03:47.653 --> 01:03:48.454]  Just west of there.
[01:03:49.134 --> 01:03:49.755]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:50.556 --> 01:03:51.637]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:03:54.329 --> 01:04:01.713]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:01.973 --> 01:04:06.716]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.956 --> 01:04:12.599]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.839 --> 01:04:17.382]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.583 --> 01:04:24.728]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.768 --> 01:04:29.291]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.451 --> 01:04:31.973]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masses of terror.
[01:04:32.213 --> 01:04:37.517]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying
[01:04:37.537 --> 01:04:37.777]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.943 --> 01:05:03.009]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.249 --> 01:05:14.496]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.816 --> 01:05:20.540]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:21.260]  We're good to go.
[01:05:48.064 --> 01:05:51.036]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:53.254 --> 01:05:58.758]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:05:58.918 --> 01:05:59.999]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:06:00.119 --> 01:06:00.979]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:03.941]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:06:04.122 --> 01:06:09.005]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:06:09.245 --> 01:06:10.346]  Check out this new product.
[01:06:10.486 --> 01:06:13.408]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:06:13.768 --> 01:06:17.431]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:06:17.971 --> 01:06:20.233]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.
[01:06:20.253 --> 01:06:25.176]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[01:06:25.476 --> 01:06:28.598]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[01:06:28.718 --> 01:06:34.122]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:06:34.222 --> 01:06:34.942]  Try Nobio.
[01:06:35.103 --> 01:06:36.083]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:06:37.244 --> 01:06:40.106]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[01:06:40.326 --> 01:06:43.209]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B-O.
[01:06:43.389 --> 01:06:45.891]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[01:06:46.011 --> 01:06:49.293]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-B-O.
[01:06:49.493 --> 01:06:51.095]  That's no-bo.com.
[01:06:53.276 --> 01:06:58.320]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.661 --> 01:07:00.942]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:08.970 --> 01:07:11.531]  Well, there is a new pope, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:11.591 --> 01:07:12.431]  This just in.
[01:07:14.792 --> 01:07:21.595]  Benedict XVI, formerly Joseph Ratzinger, of Germany.
[01:07:23.336 --> 01:07:24.596]  So a German pope.
[01:07:25.636 --> 01:07:32.479]  Not an African pope, or an Asian pope, or not an Italian pope, but a German, a Deutsch pope.
[01:07:33.263 --> 01:07:42.948]  Benedict XVI, Joseph Ratzinger, and we'll get this posted right now on InfoWars.com.
[01:07:44.009 --> 01:07:44.849]  We'll get more details.
[01:07:44.929 --> 01:07:52.893]  And I'm so busy judging these new ads last week and finishing up the ad I made against Schwarzenegger.
[01:07:54.114 --> 01:07:55.895]  I've continually meant to call and get...
[01:07:56.975 --> 01:08:02.537]  I'd be honored to have Hutton Gibson on, because he's an expert on the Catholic Church and the corruption going on in it.
[01:08:03.037 --> 01:08:08.239]  And he'll know who Joseph Ratzinger is and give us his take on him.
[01:08:09.779 --> 01:08:11.239]  I don't know if Hutton's in town right now.
[01:08:11.279 --> 01:08:13.300]  Perhaps I can call and get him on to talk about this.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:18.202]  I know we have a lot of Catholics out there, especially Catholics who are trying to reform the Catholic Church.
[01:08:18.662 --> 01:08:20.962]  They're aware of who Joseph Ratzinger is.
[01:08:21.523 --> 01:08:25.844]  I'm familiar with him a little bit, but I don't want to comment and go off half-cocked.
[01:08:26.756 --> 01:08:37.685]  So, I know the phone lines are loaded, but if you can get in and tell us what you know about Joseph Ratzinger, now Benedict XVI, a German Pope, 1-800-259-9231, if you can get in.
[01:08:37.705 --> 01:08:37.765]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:08:37.785 --> 01:08:40.448]  Boy, I guess changing the rules made the conclave go a lot faster.
[01:08:40.528 --> 01:08:45.712]  In 96, Pope John Paul II changed the rules to where it could just be a simple majority.
[01:08:56.601 --> 01:09:03.086]  But I guess they did get a majority because the conclave just started yesterday, or really today.
[01:09:04.027 --> 01:09:10.271]  And boom, they've got their new Pope, Joseph Ratzinger, of Deutschland, hailing from Germany.
[01:09:12.213 --> 01:09:12.913]  Quite literally.
[01:09:13.934 --> 01:09:16.796]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:19.161]  Jason in Maryland.
[01:09:19.181 --> 01:09:19.762]  You're on the air.
[01:09:19.842 --> 01:09:20.282]  Go ahead.
[01:09:20.583 --> 01:09:21.103]  Hi, Alex.
[01:09:21.183 --> 01:09:21.524]  Thanks.
[01:09:22.064 --> 01:09:27.630]  That's exactly why I was calling in about the Pope being elected today, Joseph Ratzinger.
[01:09:28.210 --> 01:09:39.262]  And I was just curious if you thought that it was curious that he was elected on the 19th of April with the things you were speaking about previously.
[01:09:40.914 --> 01:09:42.095]  That's very interesting.
[01:09:42.556 --> 01:09:44.417]  Again, I don't know a lot about Ratzinger.
[01:09:44.457 --> 01:09:45.198]  What do you know about him?
[01:09:45.458 --> 01:09:45.838]  Nothing.
[01:09:46.119 --> 01:09:50.743]  I know absolutely nothing except for those dates and the importance of them.
[01:09:52.144 --> 01:09:53.525]  Can you fill in a couple of gaps?
[01:09:53.585 --> 01:09:55.687]  I've got Waco and Oklahoma City.
[01:09:57.229 --> 01:10:01.032]  Adolf Hitler born and the Revolutionary War started.
[01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:04.086]  On this date, am I missing anything?
[01:10:04.106 --> 01:10:06.007]  No, I believe that's correct, yes.
[01:10:06.367 --> 01:10:06.728]  Okay.
[01:10:07.348 --> 01:10:20.697]  And the other thing, I'm sure that you'll flesh the Joseph Ratzinger thing out in the near future, so the only other thing is, did you know that they just discovered a huge oil deposit in Megiddo?
[01:10:22.358 --> 01:10:25.701]  Well, I thought a few years ago there in northern Israel,
[01:10:27.192 --> 01:10:31.114]  Right on the border with what is going into Syrian lands.
[01:10:31.194 --> 01:10:33.015]  I thought they found oil there years ago.
[01:10:33.455 --> 01:10:35.516]  Was that Megiddo, though, specifically?
[01:10:36.096 --> 01:10:36.396]  Yes.
[01:10:36.876 --> 01:10:37.816]  Oh, I had no idea.
[01:10:37.836 --> 01:10:40.137]  You're talking about the plain of Megiddo?
[01:10:40.277 --> 01:10:40.618]  Yes, sir.
[01:10:40.918 --> 01:10:42.358]  Below the Golan Heights?
[01:10:42.398 --> 01:10:42.518]  Mm-hmm.
[01:10:43.719 --> 01:10:44.739]  Yes, I believe they found oil.
[01:10:45.139 --> 01:10:47.661]  I mean, perhaps they found a new, even bigger deposit.
[01:10:48.221 --> 01:10:51.282]  That was the information that I got, that it was fairly new.
[01:10:51.362 --> 01:10:53.583]  So that's all I had.
[01:10:54.952 --> 01:10:57.433]  That whole area is swimming in oil, but that's very interesting.
[01:10:57.453 --> 01:10:58.133]  Thanks for the call.
[01:11:00.273 --> 01:11:05.595]  Yes, it's Joseph Ratzinger, and I know that announcement was made in the last 30 minutes or so.
[01:11:05.655 --> 01:11:07.756]  Sorry if we were a little bit late giving it to you.
[01:11:08.576 --> 01:11:13.837]  Benedict XVI, Joseph Ratzinger, formerly known as, hailing from Germany.
[01:11:15.098 --> 01:11:20.479]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in New York.
[01:11:20.519 --> 01:11:21.279]  Paul, go ahead.
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:23.160]  Paul just hung up.
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:23.680]  Who's up next?
[01:11:26.734 --> 01:11:28.435]  Caller from Florida, what's your first name?
[01:11:28.815 --> 01:11:29.115]  Hal.
[01:11:29.935 --> 01:11:30.295]  Welcome.
[01:11:31.116 --> 01:11:31.756]  How are you, Alex?
[01:11:32.236 --> 01:11:32.476]  Good.
[01:11:33.196 --> 01:11:34.897]  I haven't been on for a long time.
[01:11:34.957 --> 01:11:38.098]  I got wiped out by Hurricane Ivan down here.
[01:11:39.579 --> 01:11:41.359]  Well, I'm glad to hear you're doing better.
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:43.880]  Well, I'm not really doing that much better.
[01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:44.881]  Maybe some worse.
[01:11:44.981 --> 01:11:52.563]  But anyway, I'm back on and I got a couple of questions.
[01:11:52.623 --> 01:11:54.384]  Since you were on the Waco thing,
[01:11:55.765 --> 01:12:03.611]  You know, we've still got people like Dr. Charles Sell, that dentist that was out there, still in prison, no charges.
[01:12:03.671 --> 01:12:09.916]  We've got all those people that survived that Waco thing, still in prison, no charges.
[01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:17.562]  We've got, right now, the United Nations trying to take over control of all international waters.
[01:12:17.582 --> 01:12:19.363]  I don't know if you heard about that one or not.
[01:12:20.464 --> 01:12:20.644]  But...
[01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:45.295]  I don't articulate things quite as well as you do, but I got a whole page of things here that I could bring up ahead of time, which I'm sure I don't, but nevertheless... Well, yes, I'm aware of the Law of the Sea Treaty, where they're going to tax all maritime activities, and it'll be a huge global tax, and 71% of the Earth's surface is water.
[01:12:45.395 --> 01:12:52.337]  They also claim large bodies of freshwater, like the Great Lakes, which have been under international control for about seven years.
[01:12:54.216 --> 01:12:57.057]  And I am aware of what you mentioned about Waco.
[01:12:57.097 --> 01:13:05.038]  And for those who don't know, Judge Walter E. Smith had the trial down in San Antonio in 1994, the criminal trial.
[01:13:06.118 --> 01:13:09.199]  And the Davidians were found not guilty of murder.
[01:13:10.199 --> 01:13:12.299]  They were found not guilty of setting fire.
[01:13:12.339 --> 01:13:20.821]  They were found not guilty by the jury of shooting at the police because the feds fired a whole bunch first and wouldn't stop.
[01:13:22.512 --> 01:13:31.976]  But then the judge said, well, I find you guilty, which was new ground, for having guns in the commission of a crime, even though they were found not guilty of the crime.
[01:13:33.477 --> 01:13:46.963]  And so, some of them were given, what, 45 years in prison, and then in 1999, then again in 2000, the Supreme Court said, they are innocent.
[01:13:48.964 --> 01:13:50.525]  Release them from federal prison.
[01:13:51.746 --> 01:13:52.146]  Well, there's
[01:13:53.163 --> 01:13:57.344]  Five Davidians, or is it four Davidians still in prison that I've interviewed their family members?
[01:13:57.864 --> 01:13:59.645]  Well, I'm curious.
[01:13:59.705 --> 01:14:00.165]  Here's the deal.
[01:14:00.565 --> 01:14:06.006]  How do you spend time in prison when the Supreme Court has said release you and you were found not guilty?
[01:14:06.486 --> 01:14:08.047]  But then Smith went further.
[01:14:08.607 --> 01:14:18.509]  When the Davidians sued them with the second civil trial in 1999, Judge Walter Smith said, I'm not allowing a jury.
[01:14:19.149 --> 01:14:19.989]  I'm going to decide.
[01:14:20.029 --> 01:14:20.670]  Never before done.
[01:14:20.690 --> 01:14:22.050]  Just announce this new power.
[01:14:22.751 --> 01:14:28.416]  Well, I guess my next question is, as long as they get by by coming up with these terms like weapons and mass destruction, we buy them, repeat them like a parrot.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.820]  Day after day after day.
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:56.781]  We're not doing anything but helping them, number one, and things like that.
[01:14:57.401 --> 01:15:02.402]  And whether or not we've lost our Constitution and our country, we have.
[01:15:02.562 --> 01:15:05.183]  I'll announce that on April 19th, which is today.
[01:15:05.663 --> 01:15:06.343]  We've lost it.
[01:15:06.803 --> 01:15:10.464]  My question is, how in the world do we get it back?
[01:15:10.684 --> 01:15:21.267]  What can we constructively do other than talk about it and simply make people out there that don't have the foggiest, don't have a clue about what's going on,
[01:15:21.812 --> 01:15:24.734]  We just make them mad by talking to them in a lot of cases.
[01:15:25.715 --> 01:15:27.757]  And what can we really do?
[01:15:28.097 --> 01:15:32.020]  I've been listening to Shortwave and all for years.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:35.843]  I've been knowing about this long before that.
[01:15:36.423 --> 01:15:46.391]  But my question is, and my comment is, since we have lost it and it's us back, I mean, we might as well admit we've lost it.
[01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:49.534]  How do we get it back, Ellie?
[01:15:49.614 --> 01:15:50.835]  What would you suggest?
[01:15:51.590 --> 01:15:59.255]  Well, it's a whole plethora of issues and devices and mechanisms, but I appreciate the call.
[01:15:59.295 --> 01:16:00.636]  Let me try to answer that.
[01:16:00.976 --> 01:16:01.777]  I believe it was Hugh.
[01:16:03.798 --> 01:16:04.939]  Let me try to boil that down.
[01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.701]  The New World Order wasn't built in a day.
[01:16:10.503 --> 01:16:12.003]  Evil has always been with us.
[01:16:12.144 --> 01:16:13.685]  Corruption has always been there.
[01:16:14.405 --> 01:16:18.748]  And societies always knew that there were corrupt elites that fed on the public.
[01:16:19.491 --> 01:16:26.873]  Things have gotten so bad in modern times because we believe their propaganda that, oh no, government's nothing but purely good and trust it and give up all your freedoms.
[01:16:28.453 --> 01:16:33.614]  So it starts with the understanding that giving up your freedom doesn't give you security, it gives you enslavement.
[01:16:33.974 --> 01:16:34.734]  It gives you tyranny.
[01:16:36.515 --> 01:16:40.035]  And the example of 400 cities and 4 states, what is it now, 5 or 6?
[01:16:40.235 --> 01:16:42.536]  I think it's 6 states now.
[01:16:43.938 --> 01:16:46.601]  That have thrown out the Patriot Act, where they're just not following it.
[01:16:47.061 --> 01:17:00.993]  The Minutemen down in Arizona, now spreading to four states, stopping thousands of illegals coming across a day, drawing national attention to the fact that our government's doing nothing to protect us, while telling us to give up all our rights as terrorists are about to attack us.
[01:17:03.255 --> 01:17:08.500]  Just ten years ago, about 70% of Americans were pro-abortion in major polls.
[01:17:09.705 --> 01:17:13.446]  Now with adults, with men it's about 40% or 4%.
[01:17:13.806 --> 01:17:15.366]  With women, adult women, it's about 45%.
[01:17:16.246 --> 01:17:17.626]  With young people, it's only about 35%.
[01:17:20.107 --> 01:17:22.547]  Whereas a decade ago, it was the opposite.
[01:17:22.947 --> 01:17:26.308]  It was the highest numbers of people for abortion were young people.
[01:17:26.348 --> 01:17:28.888]  Now, the biggest group against abortion is the young people.
[01:17:29.148 --> 01:17:30.729]  You're against abortion, don't have one.
[01:17:32.549 --> 01:17:38.350]  I mean, I am for outlawing the practice, but we can really stop it at the grassroots, just don't have it.
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:53.349]  Let these young women know that there are good organizations, Christian and secular, that will pay for your pregnancy, lavishly take care of you, give you a moderate endowment, $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, sometimes more, for that baby.
[01:17:53.389 --> 01:17:55.170]  There are good families that want your child.
[01:17:56.531 --> 01:17:59.213]  A woman's cancer rate triples.
[01:17:59.373 --> 01:18:07.058]  Uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, cervical cancer, and other types of cancers, but especially those cancers, when you have an abortion...
[01:18:07.944 --> 01:18:11.946]  A woman is designed where if the baby's got a problem, she's going to have a miscarriage.
[01:18:12.366 --> 01:18:16.729]  But to rip out a healthy baby out of a woman, the whole hormonal structure is screwed up.
[01:18:17.269 --> 01:18:19.330]  The body takes that as a grievous insult.
[01:18:20.511 --> 01:18:23.333]  It is like chopping a big old branch off an oak tree.
[01:18:23.393 --> 01:18:24.573]  I mean, it's part of you.
[01:18:25.614 --> 01:18:27.335]  It's a separate creature, but it's part of you.
[01:18:27.535 --> 01:18:30.236]  You are literally excising part of your soul.
[01:18:30.256 --> 01:18:32.097]  That's why I believe you get sick.
[01:18:32.938 --> 01:18:36.060]  When a woman has an abortion, she loses about 12 years of her life.
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:36.780]  That's the numbers.
[01:18:38.194 --> 01:18:40.878]  So you want to chop your hand off, you go right ahead.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:43.361]  There's a whole bunch of stuff.
[01:18:43.401 --> 01:18:44.402]  We're winning, actually.
[01:18:44.423 --> 01:18:47.286]  That's why they're panicking and pulling out all the stops.
[01:18:47.306 --> 01:18:48.408]  There's hundreds of solutions.
[01:18:49.029 --> 01:18:52.033]  Getting real is first and foremost.
[01:18:53.621 --> 01:18:59.145]  We've all heard about the benefits of infrared light therapy, but never have we heard of anything as amazing as this.
[01:18:59.345 --> 01:19:06.910]  Diametics, the leading authority on polychromatic infrared diode therapy in the U.S., now offers its patented PainX 2000 to the public.
[01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:13.634]  The PainX 2000 uses the same technology NASA uses aboard the space shuttle and the same technology used by the Navy SEALs.

[01:21:00.165 --> 01:21:01.046]  It still is.
[01:21:01.646 --> 01:21:05.169]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:21:05.470 --> 01:21:07.291]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:21:07.832 --> 01:21:09.894]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:21:10.433 --> 01:21:12.474]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:21:12.834 --> 01:21:20.498]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.

[01:21:53.163 --> 01:21:56.544]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[01:22:59.776 --> 01:23:02.938]  Benedict XVI, formerly Joseph Ratzinger of Germany, 78 years old.
[01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:09.081]  And so that's pretty old for a new pope, but I'm sure that there are people out there operating 90-something years old that are sharper than I am.
[01:23:25.911 --> 01:23:29.813]  I'll have to do more research on him and give you my take on it.
[01:23:30.734 --> 01:23:34.536]  We're trying to get in touch with some of the best experts out there that have been studying this.
[01:23:36.537 --> 01:23:40.379]  You know, I don't like to just blurt out my opinion on something until I've actually got some facts.
[01:23:41.259 --> 01:23:43.060]  But we'll continue to research this.
[01:23:43.461 --> 01:23:47.183]  Perhaps callers who are Catholic out there know more about this than I do.
[01:23:47.203 --> 01:23:48.483]  1-800-259-9231 A conclave in the last hour.
[01:23:54.818 --> 01:24:00.582]  ...has chosen Benedict XVI, Joseph Ratzinger of Deutschland.
[01:24:01.663 --> 01:24:03.344]  John in Georgia, you're on the air.
[01:24:03.424 --> 01:24:03.784]  Welcome.
[01:24:04.745 --> 01:24:05.666]  Yes, Mr. Jones.
[01:24:06.266 --> 01:24:06.666]  How you doing?
[01:24:06.967 --> 01:24:07.187]  Good.
[01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:10.209]  I have this website I found.
[01:24:10.309 --> 01:24:16.974]  It's about the defense forces that are popping up all around the nation under the name State Guard.
[01:24:16.994 --> 01:24:18.435]  It's like the National Guard, but...
[01:24:19.386 --> 01:24:22.028]  They seem to be, like, kind of FEMA-contracted or something.
[01:24:22.188 --> 01:24:22.929]  No, and they admit it.
[01:24:22.949 --> 01:24:24.370]  They do urban warfare drills.
[01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:25.912]  They do gun confiscation drills.
[01:24:25.972 --> 01:24:32.777]  I've got the Texas State Guard documents from here in Texas where they have geared up for martial law.
[01:24:33.818 --> 01:24:39.243]  There's this website, sta.us.org, rather.
[01:24:39.665 --> 01:24:43.266]  You can go on there and find any state guard association in your state.
[01:24:43.446 --> 01:24:46.167]  Well, it's in the new film.
[01:24:46.227 --> 01:24:46.847]  I show some of these.
[01:24:46.887 --> 01:24:53.049]  But the Alabama Defense Forces go out and set up downtown and search little kids, search families.
[01:24:55.430 --> 01:25:01.512]  I live on the Georgia-Tennessee line here, and I went to go check these guys out for the Tennessee Defense Force.
[01:25:01.872 --> 01:25:03.792]  And now they call themselves the Tennessee State Guards.
[01:25:04.032 --> 01:25:05.293]  I'm like, hey, how you guys doing?
[01:25:06.297 --> 01:25:10.699]  I went to go meet them at one of their meetings and stuff, and they're sitting there saying they have orders ready.
[01:25:10.879 --> 01:25:15.421]  They're ready for when, you know, something bad happens to help get guns from people and set up roadblocks for our safety.
[01:25:15.441 --> 01:25:16.942]  So I was just kind of playing along.
[01:25:17.122 --> 01:25:17.842]  Oh, this is neat.
[01:25:18.023 --> 01:25:19.543]  This is neat.
[01:25:19.623 --> 01:25:22.665]  Oh, you've got to take a hidden recorder in there.
[01:25:22.865 --> 01:25:24.345]  So, no, no, I mean, I've got to hear this.
[01:25:24.746 --> 01:25:26.166]  So you went to one of their meetings.
[01:25:26.206 --> 01:25:26.747]  Describe it.
[01:25:27.707 --> 01:25:31.509]  Oh, well, it's, for lack of a better term, the people there weren't too intelligent.
[01:25:31.589 --> 01:25:33.870]  It was just a bunch of good old boys and stuff, you know.
[01:25:34.386 --> 01:25:35.667]  Thinking they're everything.
[01:25:35.987 --> 01:25:36.488]  No, I know.
[01:25:36.888 --> 01:25:39.670]  And so gun control's good because they're going to be carrying it out.
[01:25:40.131 --> 01:25:41.632]  Now, let's get into the gun part.
[01:25:41.672 --> 01:25:42.693]  What exactly did they say?
[01:25:43.393 --> 01:25:44.795]  Well, I'm former military.
[01:25:44.815 --> 01:25:45.775]  I'm former Marine Corps.
[01:25:46.296 --> 01:25:48.718]  And, you know, I was talking to the guys.
[01:25:48.758 --> 01:25:51.560]  Half of them are just, you know, never even been in the military.
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.902]  And they're speaking about how they have rumors.
[01:25:53.922 --> 01:25:54.322]  No, no, no.
[01:25:54.383 --> 01:25:55.383]  They're brown shirts.
[01:25:56.144 --> 01:25:59.527]  They're just soft, stupid cannon fodder.
[01:25:59.567 --> 01:25:59.927]  Go ahead.
[01:26:00.668 --> 01:26:01.889]  And I was talking to them anyway.
[01:26:02.049 --> 01:26:03.310]  And these guys are talking about how
[01:26:04.688 --> 01:26:10.651]  They are a Department of Homeland Security, but they're civilian and they're contracted through FEMA.
[01:26:10.991 --> 01:26:13.432]  It's like a weird relationship with the state government.
[01:26:13.832 --> 01:26:19.575]  Anyway, they're planning on, if there's any national emergency, they are the ones who are going to get called out.
[01:26:20.095 --> 01:26:25.057]  They're not relative, since they're volunteers, quote unquote, but they're not relative to the federal government.
[01:26:25.517 --> 01:26:27.418]  But they're relative to the federal government through FEMA.
[01:26:27.818 --> 01:26:28.879]  They can do all this stuff.
[01:26:29.401 --> 01:26:30.682]  It won't be illegal.
[01:26:30.702 --> 01:26:32.905]  What are the specifics of gun control?
[01:26:33.105 --> 01:26:33.705]  What do they say?
[01:26:34.246 --> 01:26:39.111]  Well, taking civilians' guns at roadblocks if we have any lockdown, if things go into red alert.
[01:26:39.131 --> 01:26:39.471]  See?
[01:26:40.572 --> 01:26:42.374]  And I already have the documents on this.
[01:26:42.434 --> 01:26:48.340]  I mean, I have the Texas National Guard, which before was for wildfires or floods or things like that.
[01:26:48.360 --> 01:26:49.301]  You know, good folks.
[01:26:49.962 --> 01:26:51.944]  A police officer who's a member of this.
[01:26:53.572 --> 01:26:55.773]  Brought me the documents and he couldn't believe it.
[01:26:55.813 --> 01:26:58.253]  It is for gun confiscation.
[01:26:58.293 --> 01:26:59.734]  I covered this back in December.
[01:27:00.694 --> 01:27:04.455]  It was actually in late November that I got the documents.
[01:27:04.475 --> 01:27:09.116]  And then when martial law didn't come, you can go read the article I wrote in November about the documents.
[01:27:09.176 --> 01:27:12.037]  I said, they're preparing for martial law.
[01:27:12.517 --> 01:27:14.478]  They've been told it's going to happen.
[01:27:14.918 --> 01:27:17.519]  And I said, folks, that doesn't mean it's going to happen now.
[01:27:17.539 --> 01:27:18.839]  I even said that in the article.
[01:27:19.628 --> 01:27:30.178]  They get them ready on this heightened frostiness by always telling them it's impending, it's impending, it's impending, so they switch off their thinking process.
[01:27:30.198 --> 01:27:31.459]  This has been going on for decades.
[01:27:32.119 --> 01:27:43.810]  But now, all over the country, from Louisiana to Texas to Ohio to California, they're told, you will go door to door, you will confiscate guns.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:46.101]  No one is allowed outside their house.
[01:27:46.122 --> 01:27:47.383]  We will shut down the roads.
[01:27:47.823 --> 01:27:52.487]  We will take everyone's guns because we can't have people with guns during an emergency.
[01:27:53.107 --> 01:27:57.011]  Folks, if you take the guns, then there will be riots and problems.
[01:27:57.511 --> 01:27:58.612]  Look at the LA riots.
[01:27:58.652 --> 01:28:06.479]  It was the Koreans, a few Koreans with their guns, when the cops stood down that saved large sections of that area over in Watts.
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:10.042]  So, this is so disgusting.
[01:28:11.153 --> 01:28:13.295]  And, I mean, cops, you're not stupid.
[01:28:13.335 --> 01:28:18.178]  You know going around taking people's guns during a national emergency, number one, is futile.
[01:28:19.058 --> 01:28:20.999]  Number two, it's going to be really dangerous for you.
[01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.262]  And number three, it's totally unconstitutional and evil.
[01:28:25.162 --> 01:28:25.562]  Stay there.
[01:28:25.622 --> 01:28:26.503]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:28:26.523 --> 01:28:30.606]  We've also got an update from the Minutemen coming up for about five, ten minutes.
[01:28:30.626 --> 01:28:32.347]  But after that, I'm going to go back to you, John.
[01:28:32.367 --> 01:28:36.489]  And I want you to infiltrate and not just give us the documents, because we have that.
[01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:39.171]  I want recordings of these yahoos.
[01:28:39.671 --> 01:28:40.312]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:45.005]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.486 --> 01:28:47.106]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.006 --> 01:28:50.787]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.748 --> 01:29:01.711]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes, actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:29:02.111 --> 01:29:03.392]  It suppresses your immune system.
[01:29:03.592 --> 01:29:04.272]  Now check this out.
[01:29:04.612 --> 01:29:08.033]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:29:08.353 --> 01:29:10.494]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[01:29:10.994 --> 01:29:13.677]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:29:13.917 --> 01:29:14.698]  Your health suffers.
[01:29:14.958 --> 01:29:15.578]  It's that simple.
[01:29:15.919 --> 01:29:19.862]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.

[01:31:33.869 --> 01:31:39.516]  For the relief you need, Debt Relief USA is helping Americans re-secure their financial future one client at a time, excluding Maryland and New York.
[01:32:06.612 --> 01:32:10.994]  I have the Defense Force documents from, what, five different states?
[01:32:13.656 --> 01:32:14.376]  The documents.
[01:32:15.317 --> 01:32:17.218]  And I've got them from law enforcement and others.
[01:32:18.498 --> 01:32:19.779]  And none of this is even secrets.
[01:32:19.839 --> 01:32:20.899]  It's been in newspapers.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:22.620]  That, oh, there's a red alert.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:23.761]  We locked everything down.
[01:32:23.801 --> 01:32:25.782]  We confiscate your guns.
[01:32:27.143 --> 01:32:27.683]  What on earth?
[01:32:29.528 --> 01:32:39.514]  If there's some massive attack in this country, does having the police go out and try to confiscate the 400 million guns, not going to happen, from the American people do?
[01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:40.715]  How does that keep us safe?
[01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:42.536]  Well, the border's wide open!
[01:32:43.716 --> 01:32:53.082]  With Mexican coyotes, that's smugglers, killing police, killing federal officers, killing fire-reservant people, killing citizens, raping, kidnapping...
[01:32:53.951 --> 01:33:01.296]  Killing the poor Mexicans coming across, robbing them, feeding on them, all the different desperados that are down there.
[01:33:01.737 --> 01:33:02.878]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[01:33:03.718 --> 01:33:13.385]  Such an example that the Tennessee Defense Forces up in Georgia, we're a volunteer force under the state, but we're under the control of FEMA.
[01:33:13.445 --> 01:33:14.326]  Yeah, that's how it works.
[01:33:14.386 --> 01:33:17.648]  Federalized training to confiscate guns at roadblocks.
[01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:20.971]  And, folks, I've got the manuals.
[01:33:22.546 --> 01:33:23.746]  Door to door, everything.
[01:33:23.766 --> 01:33:25.907]  Let me just give the police some advice.
[01:33:28.188 --> 01:33:32.789]  Because they're going to have the police going around with these gaggles of brown shirts to supposedly support them.
[01:33:33.889 --> 01:33:36.350]  When you get that order, do not follow it.
[01:33:36.410 --> 01:33:37.471]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:33:37.551 --> 01:33:39.411]  Go confiscate guns door to door.
[01:33:40.111 --> 01:33:48.494]  If one out of a hundred houses resists you, by the time you go through one neighborhood, there's not going to be any of you left.
[01:33:49.954 --> 01:33:52.055]  And there's just a lot of people in the shadows
[01:33:52.668 --> 01:33:53.668]  That are sick of this.
[01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:55.369]  That are tired of it.
[01:33:56.029 --> 01:33:57.210]  That have just been waiting.
[01:33:57.330 --> 01:33:58.210]  Let me warn you.
[01:33:59.531 --> 01:34:00.531]  You want some intelligence.
[01:34:00.571 --> 01:34:01.412]  You want a warning.
[01:34:02.652 --> 01:34:03.453]  I'm warning you.
[01:34:05.593 --> 01:34:07.514]  I'm not sitting here threatening you.
[01:34:08.054 --> 01:34:10.315]  I'm telling you how the country is.
[01:34:11.476 --> 01:34:13.197]  I'm telling you about the atmosphere.
[01:34:13.917 --> 01:34:19.839]  I'm telling you how sick and tired all these Vietnam and Korea and even some cases World War II vets are.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:21.180]  And I'm
[01:34:21.909 --> 01:34:22.930]  And Gulf War vets.
[01:34:23.610 --> 01:34:24.471]  And just citizens.
[01:34:25.712 --> 01:34:27.833]  And your bosses know what will happen.
[01:34:28.233 --> 01:34:31.916]  They know full well what's going to happen if they send you out on gun confiscation errands.
[01:34:33.477 --> 01:34:34.037]  And they know.
[01:34:34.217 --> 01:34:37.519]  And I think they want to get a revolution going in this country.
[01:34:37.679 --> 01:34:38.920]  I don't want this to happen!
[01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:50.608]  We're about to go to our guest just here for about ten minutes because I know he's very busy and then we're going to go back to the caller who's calling in
[01:34:51.374 --> 01:34:58.335]  Who's got out of the Marines and was investigating the State Guard, now the Tennessee Defense Force.
[01:34:59.996 --> 01:35:04.257]  And again, we have photos and documents and video of all of this in my new film, Martial Law.
[01:35:04.277 --> 01:35:06.137]  We just spent about two minutes on it.
[01:35:06.817 --> 01:35:09.058]  That's how jam-packed this three-hour video is.
[01:35:09.078 --> 01:35:11.138]  I mean, we just cover hundreds of subjects.
[01:35:11.958 --> 01:35:14.139]  We show photos and documents and all of it.
[01:35:14.479 --> 01:35:15.619]  But I wanted to bring this up.
[01:35:16.577 --> 01:35:25.103]  What John in Georgia was talking about, going to one of these meetings, and, yeah, we're going to confiscate the guns because we're under FEMA, and that don't make it illegal.
[01:35:25.743 --> 01:35:28.225]  Because FEMA don't have to follow no law.
[01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:29.246]  FEMA.
[01:35:29.706 --> 01:35:30.126]  You know what?
[01:35:30.687 --> 01:35:32.748]  Under the Constitution, we need to put the troops on the border.
[01:35:32.768 --> 01:35:33.749]  That's what they're supposed to be.
[01:35:34.729 --> 01:35:36.831]  No, we've got to have the troops confiscating guns.
[01:35:37.852 --> 01:35:39.993]  And most police aren't going to go along with this, folks.
[01:35:40.133 --> 01:35:40.653]  Believe me.
[01:35:41.934 --> 01:35:42.915]  I mean, they're not stupid.
[01:35:43.798 --> 01:35:45.159]  The feds are completely delusional.
[01:35:45.299 --> 01:35:48.823]  I mean, the army told them, 400,000 troops, minimum for Iraq.
[01:35:49.363 --> 01:35:50.104]  No, they said 150,000.
[01:35:50.284 --> 01:35:55.909]  They just keep telling their people to do stuff that cannot be done.
[01:35:56.189 --> 01:35:57.810]  You cannot get our guns.
[01:35:58.671 --> 01:36:00.112]  You cannot defeat us.
[01:36:00.593 --> 01:36:01.954]  We will defend this republic.
[01:36:02.935 --> 01:36:04.976]  But the globalists want to have this clash.
[01:36:06.157 --> 01:36:09.440]  And I want to warn patriots out there, if...
[01:36:11.838 --> 01:36:20.821]  If the government starts trying to go around confiscating guns en masse, try to avoid these poor, stupid police that do come.
[01:36:21.641 --> 01:36:23.422]  Just try to get out the back.
[01:36:24.942 --> 01:36:29.444]  I really... To each their own, but this is part of the globalist plan.
[01:36:30.624 --> 01:36:33.085]  And you've got to defend yourself, but these poor fools.
[01:36:33.145 --> 01:36:33.785]  The poor fools.
[01:36:34.974 --> 01:36:38.377]  Okay, let's go to our guest, and he's Gray Deacon.
[01:36:38.697 --> 01:36:55.568]  Gray, thanks for holding during the last few minutes as I went over that, but you guys are getting demonized for sitting in lawn chairs, calling the Border Patrol when you see illegals, but Bush says tattle on your neighbors and pay to have the middle school children spy on their parents and give them $100 bonuses.
[01:36:55.968 --> 01:36:57.269]  Gray, what's wrong with this picture?
[01:36:59.145 --> 01:37:01.306]  Well, everybody knows what's wrong with the picture.
[01:37:01.466 --> 01:37:09.510]  Somehow, we have become captive of an administration that is fascinated within itself.
[01:37:09.530 --> 01:37:14.233]  They actually believe that they can take over this country and then turn it over to Mexico.
[01:37:17.870 --> 01:37:18.731]  That's what they're looking at.
[01:37:18.751 --> 01:37:27.837]  They're looking to erase the border between Mexico and the United States and put a government in place here that looks exactly like the Mexican government.
[01:37:28.237 --> 01:37:33.240]  I was with a big corporate exec yesterday, and we were talking about the border, and he goes, Alex, what border?
[01:37:33.300 --> 01:37:34.942]  You know they're getting rid of it.
[01:37:34.962 --> 01:37:38.304]  And he goes, yeah, it's going to destroy the economy, but that's part of the plan.
[01:37:39.142 --> 01:37:43.004]  It's just nonchalantly done, and then these poor Mexicans get all prideful.
[01:37:43.324 --> 01:37:46.106]  Yeah, we're taking America back, you know, La Reconquista.
[01:37:46.506 --> 01:37:50.128]  And I go, well, then if the big corporations are so evil, why are they funding you?
[01:37:50.488 --> 01:37:53.530]  And they go, oh, oh, yeah.
[01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:55.931]  You know, they told you NAFTA would be great, too.
[01:37:55.971 --> 01:37:57.152]  Look what it's done to Mexico.
[01:37:58.452 --> 01:37:59.393]  But, I mean, go over this.
[01:37:59.573 --> 01:38:01.734]  You guys are now expanding out to four states.
[01:38:02.535 --> 01:38:02.915]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:03.115 --> 01:38:04.956]  In fact, there's going to be more states than that.
[01:38:04.996 --> 01:38:09.237]  We've already got Vermont wants to start a Minuteman project.
[01:38:10.057 --> 01:38:18.280]  North Dakota, Michigan, and Idaho already have formally requested that we come in and assist them in establishing Minuteman programs.
[01:38:18.940 --> 01:38:24.041]  Now, down on the border here, all four states are going to be going and up and operational.
[01:38:24.301 --> 01:38:30.263]  You know, there's also a nasty rumor going around, and I'm not sure where it got started, but I want to address it right now.
[01:38:31.339 --> 01:38:38.085]  Some guy up in Phoenix, Arizona on KYFI or something like that.
[01:38:38.812 --> 01:38:45.797]  Well, the Associated Press reported that they saw 200 people at one spot alone, and that there's over 1,200 people that they've counted.
[01:38:45.817 --> 01:38:46.598]  That's exactly right.
[01:38:46.638 --> 01:38:51.682]  What we have is, we've got people that are down here... You've got people spread out over 24 miles!
[01:38:51.702 --> 01:38:53.083]  Right, and over 24 hours, too.
[01:39:04.744 --> 01:39:06.624]  So it's 24 miles in 24 hours.
[01:39:06.644 --> 01:39:07.625]  There it is.
[01:39:07.865 --> 01:39:11.505]  You aren't going to find great big groups of people because that's essentially what we're doing.
[01:39:11.525 --> 01:39:12.145]  Well, it's like police.
[01:39:12.165 --> 01:39:16.826]  I mean, if you've got 2,000 cops in a big city, you're not going to constantly see police, but the police are there.
[01:39:17.206 --> 01:39:18.026]  Right, exactly.
[01:39:18.346 --> 01:39:20.067]  And, you know, we've been really, really effective.
[01:39:20.107 --> 01:39:24.968]  There used to be 3,000 people a night come over, and if you take that... Fed zone numbers.
[01:39:25.748 --> 01:39:26.568]  Fed zone numbers.
[01:39:27.088 --> 01:39:31.889]  If you take that, that means in the 18 days of operation we've had, there would be...
[01:39:34.457 --> 01:39:36.519]  54,000 illegal Mexicans now in this country.
[01:39:36.800 --> 01:39:38.301]  That's 54,000.
[01:39:39.082 --> 01:39:45.607]  And what's happening instead by the Fed's own numbers is less than 300 to come across the border a night now.
[01:39:46.228 --> 01:39:47.809]  So we've cut it down to less than 1%.
[01:39:49.050 --> 01:39:56.877]  And we've helped the Feds in the arrest, directed the Feds in on their arrest of 284 illegal Mexicans
[01:40:01.271 --> 01:40:01.992]  Aliens.
[01:40:02.392 --> 01:40:04.274]  Those that thought that they could just walk across.
[01:40:04.654 --> 01:40:18.407]  Now, a week or two ago when this all started, actually about two weeks ago, you said about five days in, four days in, that you could see Mexican trucks redirecting and supplying the illegals and helping move them around your flank.
[01:40:18.767 --> 01:40:19.327]  That's correct.
[01:40:19.668 --> 01:40:20.929]  And they're continuing to do that.
[01:40:22.431 --> 01:40:24.373]  I got good news yesterday.
[01:40:24.413 --> 01:40:25.994]  Everybody here needs to know about it.
[01:40:26.395 --> 01:40:34.283]  That is the American Border Patrol Union up in Tucson, which is the section that addresses this area of the state.
[01:40:35.824 --> 01:40:42.351]  The Border Patrol people we work with voted overwhelmingly that they support the Minutemen.
[01:40:43.064 --> 01:40:59.452]  And that they recognize the Minutemen are down here to help them, and they understand the Minutemen are here to get adequate funding so there can be a good number of Border Patrol members, the number necessary, hired, and the kind of equipment they need put in place.
[01:40:59.572 --> 01:41:06.916]  Well, the Border Patrol does one of the toughest jobs in the country, and they get a pittance, and the training is very hard to get through.
[01:41:06.936 --> 01:41:09.197]  Number one, they should lower the standards, frankly, folks.
[01:41:09.857 --> 01:41:12.199]  I've heard it's very hard from people that have been through it.
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:15.762]  And they should increase their salaries immediately.
[01:41:15.782 --> 01:41:26.651]  I mean, they pay these worthless air marshals $24,000 on top of the starting pay for a Border Patrol agent, as starting pay there, trying to get people off that job.
[01:41:26.951 --> 01:41:36.839]  Bush blocked funding for 2,000 more Border Patrol this year, but tells us to give up all of our freedoms because the terrorists are about to attack us.
[01:41:36.879 --> 01:41:38.961]  I had the Border Patrol president on last year.
[01:41:40.191 --> 01:41:45.288]  And he said, this is about a world government, we've been told, it's about destroying America.
[01:41:45.896 --> 01:41:46.676]  Right.
[01:41:46.696 --> 01:41:47.637]  Now, here's the other thing.
[01:41:47.677 --> 01:41:50.038]  Well, I mean, that's got to have the government panicking, Gray.
[01:41:50.198 --> 01:41:51.098]  That is good news.
[01:41:51.478 --> 01:41:54.579]  If their own Border Patrol union is endorsing you guys.
[01:41:54.819 --> 01:41:58.981]  Yeah, and they're really unhappy, and they're pulling every stop they can find to put us down.
[01:41:59.021 --> 01:42:12.106]  But the fact is, this just has to do with every single viewer that can hear your voice, and that is the American people are very clearly saying to the government one simple message.
[01:42:13.234 --> 01:42:15.796]  Close the borders now.
[01:42:17.277 --> 01:42:26.665]  And I think everybody needs to start chanting that, whether it's at city council, at the county boards, at the state legislature, or at Congress.
[01:42:27.266 --> 01:42:29.488]  Close the border now.
[01:42:29.568 --> 01:42:30.568]  Hey, I'll tell you what we do.
[01:42:30.648 --> 01:42:38.455]  We elect sheriffs, we pay for money for the containment facilities, and then that sheriff has the authority to grab these illegals and order the feds in to pick them up.
[01:42:39.091 --> 01:42:39.511]  That's right.
[01:42:39.591 --> 01:42:40.712]  There's so much we can do.
[01:42:40.732 --> 01:42:43.313]  You know, here's another thing everybody needs to think about.
[01:42:43.353 --> 01:42:48.676]  For over 50 years, we've had troops on the North Korea and South Korea border.
[01:42:49.256 --> 01:42:53.078]  We've now put troops and fences up around all of Afghanistan.
[01:42:53.479 --> 01:42:53.659]  Right.
[01:42:54.099 --> 01:42:56.140]  In Afghanistan, they're putting fences up.
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:58.721]  In Iraq, they're putting fences up.
[01:42:59.021 --> 01:43:02.783]  For how many years do we have, and we still have troops posted in Europe.
[01:43:04.614 --> 01:43:07.337]  You know, we're real good at watching borders.
[01:43:07.798 --> 01:43:09.660]  We're real good at securing borders.
[01:43:10.341 --> 01:43:11.783]  Other people's borders.
[01:43:12.824 --> 01:43:13.926]  Let's do our border.
[01:43:15.006 --> 01:43:19.729]  The feds can't say, we don't know how to secure a border when they've been doing it for 50 years.
[01:43:19.829 --> 01:43:26.673]  Bush has been fooling conservatives, but on this issue with the Minutemen, everybody I've talked to is going, you're right!
[01:43:27.173 --> 01:43:31.635]  He says give up our freedoms because terrorists are going to get us, but he's saying these Minutemen are bad.
[01:43:32.116 --> 01:43:33.116]  What's wrong with him?
[01:43:33.196 --> 01:43:34.657]  Because he wants amnesty!
[01:43:34.897 --> 01:43:37.699]  It's called the American Union, the end of America!
[01:43:38.939 --> 01:43:40.780]  Well, something has to be done about it, and...
[01:43:42.225 --> 01:43:45.546]  If the government can't do it, and here's the next thing.
[01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:52.387]  Chris Simcox, I just walked out of a meeting with him, and he says, Gary, tell the people of America one thing very clear.
[01:43:53.147 --> 01:43:59.008]  The CHD Minutemen are going to be down here on the border until the 30th of April.
[01:43:59.649 --> 01:44:08.050]  And we're going to deliver the message to Congress very clearly that you have until the 1st of October to solve the border problem.
[01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:11.131]  Otherwise, close the border now.
[01:44:12.305 --> 01:44:20.931]  If they don't do it, we are going to call on all of the people of America to come down and help us close the border from San Diego to Brownsville.
[01:44:21.992 --> 01:44:30.778]  Come on down and help us in October because we want to put 25,000 people on the border and make the feds close the border now.
[01:44:31.895 --> 01:44:35.117]  And they're panicking trying to put out this info that it's not been a success.
[01:44:36.298 --> 01:44:38.039]  Fox admits it's a success.
[01:44:38.099 --> 01:44:40.901]  The president's having to address it and attack it.
[01:44:41.641 --> 01:44:49.646]  Now, this radio station, if you want to give out the phone number, the call-in phone number, I think you can call and demand.
[01:44:49.686 --> 01:44:54.209]  They give you equal time to address what they said.
[01:44:54.569 --> 01:44:56.030]  Well, that's what I'm doing.
[01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:58.111]  I've got a phone call in to them right now.
[01:44:58.131 --> 01:44:59.752]  Now, here's the irony of the thing.
[01:45:00.208 --> 01:45:03.372]  You know who's playing on the radio right now on that station?
[01:45:03.693 --> 01:45:04.333]  Lord Limbaugh.
[01:45:04.734 --> 01:45:04.894]  Yep.
[01:45:05.475 --> 01:45:06.516]  And he's not talking about it.
[01:45:06.817 --> 01:45:07.758]  He's not talking about it.
[01:45:08.999 --> 01:45:10.339]  Well, and he's an ultra-liberal.
[01:45:10.359 --> 01:45:14.661]  His job is to keep real conservatives in the dark to ensure the globalist victory.
[01:45:15.081 --> 01:45:16.481]  Well, here's the problem we got.
[01:45:17.022 --> 01:45:25.764]  If people don't listen, and if people don't hold their heads up, you realize, and I think everybody else realizes, that the Minutemen are the modern Minutemen.
[01:45:26.145 --> 01:45:36.948]  We're the ones that are right now riding through your towns and your communities, in this case, over the airwaves and through your TV sets, and calling all Americans to arms, to arms, to arms.
[01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:41.423]  We have to defend our country or we will lose our country.
[01:45:41.443 --> 01:45:55.113]  And if we don't have the courage to turn off the damn TV set, stop watching reality TV, and start taking part in our own lives, then one day we're going to wake up and we are no longer going to be the land of the free and the home of the brave.
[01:45:55.273 --> 01:45:57.255]  Well, let me give people a newsflash.
[01:45:57.295 --> 01:45:59.817]  There is this artificial pride...
[01:46:00.603 --> 01:46:06.264]  With some of the reconquistas, and it's not the majority of Hispanics, and polls, the majority of Hispanics are against what's happening.
[01:46:06.284 --> 01:46:06.984]  They're not stupid.
[01:46:07.004 --> 01:46:07.804]  Very patriotic.
[01:46:08.664 --> 01:46:09.965]  Who think, oh, this is our time.
[01:46:09.985 --> 01:46:10.585]  We're taking over.
[01:46:10.645 --> 01:46:11.205]  Ha, ha, ha.
[01:46:11.505 --> 01:46:13.505]  We're going to get the evil rich whiteys.
[01:46:14.025 --> 01:46:16.846]  Why is evil rich whitey pushing this and backing this?
[01:46:17.186 --> 01:46:19.306]  Because they want a pan-American union.
[01:46:19.546 --> 01:46:23.327]  They want to drive all our wages down to subsistence level.
[01:46:23.607 --> 01:46:26.108]  This is about de-industrializing this country.
[01:46:26.428 --> 01:46:27.928]  This is about a new world order.
[01:46:28.448 --> 01:46:29.990]  And I call on all Hispanics.
[01:46:30.010 --> 01:46:36.518]  Listen, when I went and protested Fox, we had Hispanics there with us on bullhorns calling him a traitor, saying they were against open borders.
[01:46:36.578 --> 01:46:37.419]  They're not stupid.
[01:46:37.919 --> 01:46:39.942]  And so we need to stop the media.
[01:46:40.993 --> 01:46:45.615]  From creating this illusion, Gray Deacon, that Hispanics want an open border.
[01:46:46.015 --> 01:46:46.355]  They do.
[01:46:46.736 --> 01:47:01.262]  Maybe the young, stupid ones at college, again, funded by the Carnegie or Ford Foundations do, same people that fund these wars, maybe they do, but folks, that's not the majority, and we have to stop letting the globalists set the parameters of the debate.
[01:47:02.692 --> 01:47:05.574]  And if we don't do it now, we are going to lose everything.
[01:47:06.054 --> 01:47:13.018]  Well, I mean, I know that it's been Hispanic ranchers that were some of the first to start stopping the illegals who were sick and tired of it down there.
[01:47:13.038 --> 01:47:16.600]  And I've read a lot of Hispanics have come down to help the middlemen.
[01:47:16.960 --> 01:47:20.142]  We have many people from many races, creeds, and religions.
[01:47:20.582 --> 01:47:26.566]  This is about America regaining the right to say very clearly...
[01:47:27.162 --> 01:47:31.665]  We have borders around our country, and you will respect our borders.
[01:47:31.705 --> 01:47:33.726]  You will respect us as a nation.
[01:47:34.126 --> 01:47:35.847]  You will respect us as a people.
[01:47:36.747 --> 01:47:48.073]  What do you think of these Defense Forces State Guard manuals, and I've got a bunch of them, five of them, where they openly say they're trying to confiscate our guns.
[01:47:48.534 --> 01:47:52.376]  Our border is wide open, but our military is trying to take our guns.
[01:47:54.937 --> 01:47:56.398]  It's not permitted to cry, is it?
[01:47:58.526 --> 01:48:01.289]  Because there's only two actual responses to that.
[01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:09.157]  One is to whimper, as a coward will, and the other is to stand up, stick your chin out, and say, I don't think so.
[01:48:11.252 --> 01:48:13.073]  Well, I mean, I can only commend you.
[01:48:13.093 --> 01:48:15.214]  You guys are talking about four states right now.
[01:48:15.294 --> 01:48:19.817]  Headline, Minutemen Project expanding to four states and nationwide.
[01:48:19.857 --> 01:48:24.500]  You're going to be encouraging people to report on illegal aliens working in businesses.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:25.520]  Exactly.
[01:48:25.540 --> 01:48:28.142]  And, in fact, that's one of the things that Jim Gilchrist is doing.
[01:48:28.182 --> 01:48:35.446]  You know, he's the CPA, and he's going to go out, and he's going to figure out the best way to identify those people and the best way to hurt them.
[01:48:35.787 --> 01:48:37.868]  And it includes boycotts, strikes.
[01:48:39.385 --> 01:48:40.985]  Lawsuits, you name it.
[01:48:41.085 --> 01:48:42.006]  We're going after them.
[01:48:42.106 --> 01:48:47.586]  Yeah, why are the unions pro-open borders when it destroys everybody's paycheck?
[01:48:48.447 --> 01:48:49.727]  Why do the unions put up with that?
[01:48:49.747 --> 01:48:51.927]  Well, there's a lot of unions.
[01:48:52.047 --> 01:49:08.250]  The truckers union right here in the Southwest is just absolutely furious because Mr. Bush, President Bush, excuse me, President Bush has stated that it is his intent to open the entire Southwest to Mexican truckers
[01:49:08.795 --> 01:49:15.041]  And they are not going to be held to the same standards of safety or inspection that American truckers are held to.
[01:49:15.781 --> 01:49:17.123]  Well, that's already going on.
[01:49:17.263 --> 01:49:18.484]  I mean, I already see it.
[01:49:19.225 --> 01:49:23.989]  Well, now it's going to be going all the way up into Utah, Colorado, all the way up.
[01:49:24.569 --> 01:49:27.252]  I mean, people have got to understand that.
[01:49:27.722 --> 01:49:29.224]  By the way, our boots are on the ground.
[01:49:29.244 --> 01:49:30.405]  They're going to stay on the ground.
[01:49:30.806 --> 01:49:32.508]  We came down here to serve America.
[01:49:32.888 --> 01:49:40.317]  We will continue to serve it, and we're asking every man and woman who has the courage of their convictions to come down here and join us.
[01:49:41.018 --> 01:49:42.060]  Give us the website.
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:44.723]  That is minimanproject.com.
[01:49:46.427 --> 01:49:51.310]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:49:51.330 --> 01:49:52.191]  Thank you very much.
[01:49:52.211 --> 01:49:53.172]  I'll talk to you next week.
[01:49:53.192 --> 01:49:53.652]  How about that?
[01:49:53.892 --> 01:49:58.276]  This is Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:58.436 --> 01:50:02.839]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.999 --> 01:50:07.383]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.423 --> 01:50:08.784]  The New World Order.
[01:50:10.545 --> 01:50:14.767]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.827 --> 01:50:21.771]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.891 --> 01:50:23.892]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.292 --> 01:50:34.718]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.898 --> 01:50:40.281]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:53:03.975 --> 01:53:06.318]  Well, they picked a German pontiff.
[01:53:08.139 --> 01:53:11.983]  Now, Benedict XVI, a 78-year-old individual.
[01:53:14.666 --> 01:53:19.610]  And we'll be talking more about that in the next hour, continuing with your phone calls.
[01:53:20.451 --> 01:53:22.994]  We'll finish up with John, and we'll go to Dan, Daryl, Gary...
[01:53:23.872 --> 01:53:25.633]  Miles and many, many others.
[01:53:25.893 --> 01:53:27.894]  Plus, I want to get into the CSI effect.
[01:53:28.354 --> 01:53:30.935]  How TV is driving jury verdicts all across America.
[01:53:31.235 --> 01:53:33.836]  They finally point something out that I've been noticing for years.
[01:53:35.457 --> 01:53:37.078]  But, of course, they tell you how great it is.
[01:53:37.918 --> 01:53:40.839]  They always put their disgusting spin on it.
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:46.561]  Going back to John in Georgia.
[01:53:46.902 --> 01:53:49.983]  So, John, you're a former Marine.
[01:53:50.003 --> 01:53:52.544]  You thought, oh, I'll go check out the Tennessee Defense Force.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:54:03.407]  And it trains up there in Georgia, and a lot of these defense forces do do that, and you're sitting around with these good old boys, and they're talking about gun confiscation.
[01:54:03.447 --> 01:54:08.471]  What did you, I mean, try to give me the exact quote, or paraphrase it, and then tell me how you responded to that.
[01:54:08.491 --> 01:54:13.134]  Well, it was more of a, we got in conversation about, you know, what do you guys do?
[01:54:13.575 --> 01:54:17.297]  You know, you're not the National Guard, you're not the Army, so, you know, what exactly is your job?
[01:54:17.317 --> 01:54:22.241]  They said, well, they're training, and they have gotten orders from the Tennessee State Government to, uh,
[01:54:22.662 --> 01:54:29.947]  Get the training to speed up and get more intense for when a national emergency happens so they can be out there setting up roadblocks.
[01:54:31.088 --> 01:54:32.149]  One thing they said clearly.
[01:54:33.310 --> 01:54:43.477]  Just getting at the armories, setting up at the armories, and also setting up for confiscation and being called out if necessary because they said we have so many forces deployed.
[01:54:45.137 --> 01:54:51.701]  I just would encourage everybody... Did you ask them why they... What does confiscating our guns do for the country?
[01:54:51.741 --> 01:54:52.521]  Did you ask them that?
[01:54:53.782 --> 01:54:55.363]  I didn't really get a response.
[01:54:55.743 --> 01:55:00.646]  Honestly, I'm not being facetious, but they were really not very intelligent people.
[01:55:01.246 --> 01:55:04.408]  I tried to get in conversation beyond that, and it's like, well, that's what we do.
[01:55:04.508 --> 01:55:05.008]  I'm good.
[01:55:05.108 --> 01:55:06.089]  I follow orders.
[01:55:06.749 --> 01:55:09.070]  But, you know, you're not even active military.
[01:55:09.691 --> 01:55:11.692]  This is ridiculous, but it's...
[01:55:13.202 --> 01:55:19.306]  If you're really active in the military, you know you follow that code book and you don't follow orders that are against it.
[01:55:21.248 --> 01:55:24.770]  I would really encourage everyone to go to S-T-A-U-S dot org.
[01:55:24.790 --> 01:55:27.052]  That's the State Guard Association of the United States.
[01:55:27.512 --> 01:55:30.434]  Find your local state guard or local defense force.
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:41.626]  Go to their website and you can find all these FEMA drills and stuff where they're having little emergencies or they had a mock spill or they had a... And that's just for the public to acclimate us to seeing them out and about.
[01:55:42.107 --> 01:55:45.449]  Well, you can find when they're having these things what they're doing.
[01:55:45.469 --> 01:55:46.289]  You can go record them.
[01:55:46.369 --> 01:55:47.970]  Go record them having a fake terror event.
[01:55:48.170 --> 01:55:49.571]  I've been to a bunch of these, yeah.
[01:55:50.352 --> 01:55:51.773]  And I encourage everybody to do that.
[01:55:51.793 --> 01:55:52.413]  And one more thing.
[01:55:52.433 --> 01:55:53.554]  This is kind of off topic, but...
[01:55:54.418 --> 01:56:08.287]  How about you get somebody on the program talking about dispensationalism and how it seems that everything's... That's one thing that seems to be hooking the majority of Protestant America, this whole dispensationalist doctrine, that, you know, we've got to support Israel no matter what they do.
[01:56:09.007 --> 01:56:11.869]  But the government of Israel is not, you know, they're not holy.
[01:56:11.889 --> 01:56:16.972]  I'd just like to get somebody on talking about the evil of dispensationalism.
[01:56:17.092 --> 01:56:18.313]  Excellent show, and you're my hero.
[01:56:18.873 --> 01:56:19.613]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:56:19.633 --> 01:56:20.314]  No, you're my hero.
[01:56:21.351 --> 01:56:24.753]  You know, I hope that that stuff's not classified.
[01:56:24.813 --> 01:56:33.978]  It's usually do not distribute, do not circulate, but maybe you should join and get the manuals.
[01:56:34.819 --> 01:56:38.681]  Well, if they aren't privy to what I've been doing, I guess I'll try.
[01:56:38.741 --> 01:56:41.483]  Oh, no, as you said, these people are complete morons.
[01:56:42.203 --> 01:56:43.964]  I mean, have you seen my new film yet?
[01:56:44.584 --> 01:56:45.025]  Oh, yes, sir.
[01:56:45.045 --> 01:56:45.585]  It was excellent.
[01:56:46.084 --> 01:56:51.588]  Well, I mean, did you see where I show them, like, just on city streets searching little girls Barbie bags?
[01:56:52.248 --> 01:56:55.671]  Well, I don't think people really understand the attitude of these people.
[01:56:56.151 --> 01:56:56.651]  They love it.
[01:56:56.671 --> 01:56:58.733]  They're literally the goons of Nazi Germany.
[01:56:59.444 --> 01:57:01.365]  They walk up and grab your stuff.
[01:57:01.385 --> 01:57:11.167]  I mean, folks, in small towns, you just drive up and there's goons and a woman with a hamburger in one hand and a cigarette in the other with her uniform hanging out over her belt.
[01:57:11.527 --> 01:57:13.028]  Get out of the car!
[01:57:13.408 --> 01:57:15.928]  We're checking things!
[01:57:16.048 --> 01:57:16.849]  What's going on here?
[01:57:17.069 --> 01:57:18.769]  We're part of the Defense Force!
[01:57:20.870 --> 01:57:21.530]  Am I joking?
[01:57:22.290 --> 01:57:22.590]  No, sir.
[01:57:22.610 --> 01:57:22.810]  Okay.
[01:57:22.870 --> 01:57:26.251]  I actually have photos of them with hamburgers and cigarettes.
[01:57:26.771 --> 01:57:28.392]  They put it on their own websites.
[01:57:28.412 --> 01:57:29.072]  They're proud of it.
[01:57:30.157 --> 01:57:31.618]  Looks like they're in flower sacks.
[01:57:31.638 --> 01:57:32.619]  They're just idiots.
[01:57:33.860 --> 01:57:38.383]  Man, are they going to have a rude awakening if they try to go around and do gun confiscation.
[01:57:39.264 --> 01:57:39.604]  Looks great.
[01:57:39.624 --> 01:57:40.285]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:57:40.505 --> 01:57:41.506]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:41.526 --> 01:57:42.507]  We'll be back in the third hour.
[01:57:43.968 --> 01:57:44.428]  Hello, folks.
[01:57:45.329 --> 01:57:46.410]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.380 --> 01:57:52.461]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.161 --> 01:57:54.262]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.902 --> 01:57:55.743]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.483 --> 01:57:57.424]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.084 --> 01:58:01.686]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.247 --> 01:58:06.369]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.570 --> 01:58:18.397]  Joseph Ratzinger, now Benedict XVI, 78-year-old pontiff, replacing...
[01:58:19.642 --> 01:58:24.086]  Pope John Paul II of Poland, there at the Holy See.
[01:58:26.107 --> 01:58:29.610]  We are now into hour number three on this April 19th, 2005 edition.
[01:58:29.630 --> 01:58:37.137]  I do want to get a little bit into the truth of what happened at Waco 12 years ago, what really happened in Oklahoma City a full decade ago.
[01:58:37.177 --> 01:58:44.503]  Hard to believe that much time has elapsed since both of those tragic events orchestrated by the New World Order.
[01:58:46.954 --> 01:58:52.097]  The last hour we were talking to the spokesman, head coordinator for the Minutemen, Gray Deacon.
[01:58:54.078 --> 01:58:54.938]  And think about this.
[01:58:55.299 --> 01:58:56.699]  Citizens are just sick of it.
[01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:00.702]  They're tired of having the borders wide open when they tell us the terrorists are about to attack.
[01:59:00.742 --> 01:59:05.064]  They're tired of the illegals driving down the wages in every industry out there.
[01:59:07.865 --> 01:59:11.788]  And so, they just go down there and start calling the border patrol every time they see illegals.
[01:59:11.908 --> 01:59:12.708]  It's real simple.
[01:59:13.549 --> 01:59:14.149]  And before that,
[01:59:15.518 --> 01:59:24.385]  They're demonized by people like Bill Maher, who goes on Jay Leno and says, oh, these Minutemen are bad, we need illegal aliens to take the jobs nobody wants.
[01:59:24.405 --> 01:59:35.874]  Yeah, because the illegals will then take all the jobs at amounts of pay that somebody who's in the system with insurance or paying taxes can't afford to live on.
[01:59:36.515 --> 01:59:42.480]  The illegals will live 5, 10 to an apartment or a house, work for nothing, and then debase the...
[01:59:43.757 --> 01:59:44.377]  The wages.
[01:59:44.557 --> 01:59:46.438]  And that's why the big corporations are for it.
[01:59:46.518 --> 01:59:47.859]  The establishment is for it.
[01:59:48.879 --> 01:59:51.280]  There's nothing cutting edge or rebellious about what you're doing.
[01:59:51.601 --> 01:59:52.561]  You're serving the system.
[01:59:53.261 --> 02:00:09.148]  And then we're just going to lower our standards to the standards of Mexico, and then Mexico can't compete with China, so their economy's in bloating, so now we're lowered to their standard, and the globalists have leveraged all their assets into China to control that emerging market, be the biggest in the world very soon, and it's over for us.
[02:00:09.188 --> 02:00:10.209]  It's bad for everybody.
[02:00:10.529 --> 02:00:12.570]  We can stop the globalization process now.
[02:00:13.297 --> 02:00:14.999]  But we don't have much more time.
[02:00:17.041 --> 02:00:17.141]  Oh!
[02:00:19.623 --> 02:00:21.945]  I'm going to continue with calls, but I do have a news blitz.
[02:00:22.165 --> 02:00:28.151]  I'm going to finish up with the callers we've got right now, quickly, and then I'm going to go back into news and back into calls.
[02:00:28.191 --> 02:00:29.172]  There's so much news here.
[02:00:30.193 --> 02:00:33.155]  Let's talk to Dan in Texas.
[02:00:33.175 --> 02:00:34.036]  Thanks for holding, Dan.
[02:00:34.056 --> 02:00:34.457]  Go ahead.
[02:00:35.177 --> 02:00:36.719]  God bless you, Alex Jones.
[02:00:37.853 --> 02:00:39.754]  Well, God bless you, Dan, from Texas.
[02:00:40.134 --> 02:00:42.055]  I really enjoy the show that you do.
[02:00:42.075 --> 02:00:48.199]  I thank God every day for you being one of our fellow American patriots carrying the truth.
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:55.943]  I'd like to also say God bless the men down in Arizona, the fine fellow you had on just minutes ago.
[02:00:57.135 --> 02:01:01.717]  They're definitely doing the government's job, and they're doing a darn fine job of it.
[02:01:01.857 --> 02:01:10.061]  What do you think of FEMA, meanwhile, as training local yahoos from Texas to Oklahoma to Tennessee to confiscate our guns?
[02:01:10.921 --> 02:01:17.984]  Well, I just hope that they bring a good amount of body bags with them when they do come to confiscate the guns.
[02:01:19.045 --> 02:01:24.507]  The Second Amendment clearly gives the militia, which is the people, the right to keep and bear arms.
[02:01:25.924 --> 02:01:28.545]  None of us will give up our arms willingly.
[02:01:28.945 --> 02:01:37.950]  Well, first off, how does it keep us safe in the middle of, say, a nuke going off in Chicago to run around in Tennessee and Texas and California confiscating guns?
[02:01:38.771 --> 02:01:44.354]  Alex, you know as well as I do, it's just part of the program, part of the New World Order movement.
[02:01:44.875 --> 02:01:46.255]  It will not keep us safe.
[02:01:46.495 --> 02:01:47.596]  I mean, here's the newsflash.
[02:01:47.736 --> 02:01:49.037]  I have the official documents.
[02:01:49.077 --> 02:01:49.657]  These are public.
[02:01:50.218 --> 02:01:52.059]  The government's really training to do this.
[02:01:53.007 --> 02:02:02.630]  Well, like I say, they will be making a big mistake if they think they can come and disarm the American militia here in the United States.
[02:02:02.770 --> 02:02:04.230]  It's just not going to happen.
[02:02:04.850 --> 02:02:06.170]  Well, most police aren't stupid.
[02:02:06.190 --> 02:02:07.671]  They're not going to do it predominantly.
[02:02:07.691 --> 02:02:13.212]  But these brainwashed elite troops that think they're the best, they'll try it for a while.
[02:02:13.832 --> 02:02:18.214]  And then mainly these SA brown shirt goons, they will try it.
[02:02:18.774 --> 02:02:19.774]  Well, maybe so.
[02:02:20.952 --> 02:02:33.076]  Let me say this, Alex, that our presidents have took an oath the same as I took when I was a military man, that they were to defend our country against all enemies, both foreign and domestic.
[02:02:33.156 --> 02:02:37.457]  That means illegal aliens as well as law enforcement out of control.
[02:02:37.877 --> 02:02:40.418]  And I think you'll see that if it ever comes to that.
[02:02:41.998 --> 02:02:42.919]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:02:42.959 --> 02:02:43.399]  Good points.
[02:02:43.419 --> 02:02:43.839]  We'll be back.
[02:02:45.513 --> 02:02:47.055]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.215 --> 02:02:50.298]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.438 --> 02:02:54.342]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.382 --> 02:02:58.626]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:02:58.966 --> 02:03:02.750]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.870 --> 02:03:04.692]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:07.934 --> 02:03:12.918]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.098 --> 02:03:16.140]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:03:16.320 --> 02:03:19.162]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.662 --> 02:03:25.787]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.307 --> 02:03:30.091]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:03:30.511 --> 02:03:31.872]  Order your video today.
[02:03:32.273 --> 02:03:33.274]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:03:33.374 --> 02:03:35.616]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[02:03:35.636 --> 02:03:36.877]  Or go to my website, Infowars.com.
[02:03:44.924 --> 02:03:45.524]  Hello, folks.
[02:03:45.624 --> 02:03:46.545]  Alex Jones here.
[02:03:46.665 --> 02:03:50.786]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:50.906 --> 02:03:53.807]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:53.887 --> 02:04:00.590]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:03.771]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:03.991 --> 02:04:06.392]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:06.492 --> 02:04:11.214]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:04:11.414 --> 02:04:25.982]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Aptazine, Benzene, Chloride, and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[02:04:26.143 --> 02:04:32.826]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:04:35.708 --> 02:04:36.169]  803-4438.
[02:04:36.209 --> 02:04:36.590]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.671 --> 02:04:38.014]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:04:44.246 --> 02:04:51.693]  This is Wendy Malek from Just Shoot Me, here to tell you about Pets 911, a free public service changing the way we care for pets in every community nationwide.
[02:04:51.853 --> 02:04:56.036]  Across the country, there are thousands of healthy, adoptable pets waiting for a loving home every day.
[02:04:56.257 --> 02:05:07.927]  By calling 1-888-PETS-911 or visiting 1-888-PETS-911.org, you will find the location of your closest adoption facility as well as tons of other information you need to know as a responsible pet owner.
[02:05:08.107 --> 02:05:09.728]  So when thinking adoption, think Pets 911.
[02:05:13.667 --> 02:05:15.348]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:05:15.549 --> 02:05:17.570]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:05:17.750 --> 02:05:18.431]  Prepare yourself.
[02:05:18.611 --> 02:05:22.314]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[02:05:22.454 --> 02:05:28.199]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.

[02:05:32.562 --> 02:05:34.144]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[02:05:34.384 --> 02:05:37.226]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[02:05:37.286 --> 02:05:38.007]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[02:05:50.100 --> 02:05:50.741]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.421 --> 02:05:52.462]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.183 --> 02:05:54.284]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.924 --> 02:05:55.765]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.526 --> 02:05:57.426]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.107 --> 02:06:01.770]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:06.414]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:06.434 --> 02:06:17.683]  78-year-old Joseph Ratzinger from Germany is now Benedict XVI's
[02:06:19.685 --> 02:06:42.771]  The new pontiff shows in the last couple hours in really almost a record from what I've read and seen conclave there at Vatican City in Rome the city there on the hills we're about to go straight back to your calls at 1-800-259-9231 we were just earlier talking about gun confiscation
[02:06:49.031 --> 02:06:58.638]  Because they have taken the State National Guard, turned them into Defense Forces, put them under FEMA's control, and they're getting another level of volunteers that serve that.
[02:06:58.859 --> 02:07:13.750]  And all over the country, I've got photos, video, news articles, mainly off the State Guard's own websites, where they'll go into a medium-sized town during some city festival and just randomly sit there on the street and search every man, woman, and child.
[02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:14.831]  I've got photos of little
[02:07:15.521 --> 02:07:18.242]  Seven-year-old girls having their little Barbie bags searched.
[02:07:18.262 --> 02:07:27.246]  Looks like they're about to cry by these people in these frumpy, you know, with stains on the front, uniforms with medals all over them.
[02:07:27.626 --> 02:07:29.227]  Most of them have never even been in the military.
[02:07:29.247 --> 02:07:32.088]  They'll have, like, some Humvees, guns.
[02:07:34.289 --> 02:07:39.751]  And digging through their stuff, you'll see a woman with a cigarette with a hamburger in her hand.
[02:07:41.613 --> 02:07:43.593]  Sitting there standing over a family being searched.
[02:07:43.633 --> 02:07:48.715]  I mean, it's just so slovenly and mindless and just reeks of tyranny.
[02:07:48.755 --> 02:07:49.555]  That's what tyranny looks like.
[02:07:50.415 --> 02:07:56.356]  You know, a fat person in a military outfit with a hamburger and a cigarette.
[02:07:56.736 --> 02:07:57.956]  I mean, that's tyranny, folks.
[02:07:57.976 --> 02:08:02.017]  It's slovenly and mindless and moronic.
[02:08:02.657 --> 02:08:05.258]  That's the kind of idiots tyrants can get.
[02:08:06.281 --> 02:08:08.824]  And they're training to confiscate our guns.
[02:08:08.844 --> 02:08:11.427]  That doesn't mean it's going to happen this week or next month or next year.
[02:08:12.268 --> 02:08:27.664]  They create those cadres, they normalize it, then they expand them out from there, and then government and law enforcement just thinks that since they've been doing something for a while, or training to do something for a while, that that makes it normal and okay and good.
[02:08:29.953 --> 02:08:35.675]  And then it'll be the toll roads and the transponders and the checkpoints and the searches on the highway just like it is at the airports.
[02:08:35.715 --> 02:08:36.955]  The feds admit that's the plan.
[02:08:37.516 --> 02:08:42.977]  And then they'll just start banning more and more guns and restricting more and more guns and just doing this more and more.
[02:08:42.997 --> 02:08:45.618]  I mean, they had the case in Oshkosh last year, Wisconsin.
[02:08:46.939 --> 02:08:48.779]  Somebody shot a cop with a .22.
[02:08:49.679 --> 02:08:50.980]  Bullet went through his arm.
[02:08:52.046 --> 02:08:58.528]  And so the cops went into the whole neighborhood and told everybody, come out front, get out of your houses, leave your house for a full day.
[02:08:58.868 --> 02:09:00.549]  They confiscated all the guns.
[02:09:01.309 --> 02:09:02.250]  Quote, do ballistics.
[02:09:03.090 --> 02:09:09.572]  Of course, didn't catch the person and couldn't get ballistics because they couldn't find the .22 bullet.
[02:09:10.092 --> 02:09:13.173]  Even if they would have, you can't really get ballistics off a .22 bullet.
[02:09:14.454 --> 02:09:15.374]  Everybody knows that.
[02:09:15.854 --> 02:09:17.535]  They're not metal jacketed folks.
[02:09:19.035 --> 02:09:20.616]  But they're very high velocity and they
[02:09:21.519 --> 02:09:23.440]  Turn into total mush on impact.
[02:09:24.521 --> 02:09:25.921]  I don't have to explain this to people.
[02:09:25.941 --> 02:09:27.442]  The cops know this, so they should.
[02:09:28.923 --> 02:09:30.304]  But it's just any excuse.
[02:09:30.324 --> 02:09:41.729]  So they have, from Phoenix, Arizona, to Dallas, Texas, one of the suburbs, to upstate New York, they have... Hello, may I help you, officer?
[02:09:42.490 --> 02:09:43.971]  Yes, mind if I do a home inspection?
[02:09:43.991 --> 02:09:45.191]  I mean, middle-class areas.
[02:09:45.671 --> 02:09:47.172]  They were doing it in poor areas for a long time.
[02:09:47.192 --> 02:09:50.574]  Bill Clinton started the housing sweeps, but now it's middle-class areas.
[02:09:51.533 --> 02:09:52.873]  The point is, that means they can do it anywhere.
[02:09:53.293 --> 02:09:54.374]  They're testing, they're pushing.
[02:09:54.734 --> 02:09:56.794]  I'd like to do a home inspection.
[02:09:56.894 --> 02:09:58.315]  Well, why, officer?
[02:09:58.595 --> 02:09:59.115]  What's going on?
[02:09:59.615 --> 02:10:00.515]  Has something happened?
[02:10:00.535 --> 02:10:01.355]  Are you looking for somebody?
[02:10:01.415 --> 02:10:04.776]  No, just it's a... We call this knock and talk.
[02:10:05.556 --> 02:10:07.297]  And we'd like to talk to you about your guns.
[02:10:07.357 --> 02:10:08.697]  Are they properly stored?
[02:10:09.557 --> 02:10:11.638]  Well, does your husband have guns?
[02:10:11.898 --> 02:10:13.678]  Well, why are you here?
[02:10:14.178 --> 02:10:15.379]  Ma'am, do you have something to hide?
[02:10:15.419 --> 02:10:18.099]  Listen, let me just check and make sure they're properly locked up.
[02:10:18.720 --> 02:10:20.560]  Would you like me to do a safety check for you?
[02:10:21.147 --> 02:10:21.767]  Excuse me, ma'am.
[02:10:21.947 --> 02:10:22.327]  Thank you.
[02:10:22.868 --> 02:10:25.688]  Now, let's see those... I mean, how do you get police?
[02:10:25.768 --> 02:10:27.409]  And these are under federal grants.
[02:10:27.449 --> 02:10:28.909]  The cops hate doing it.
[02:10:30.670 --> 02:10:35.051]  But the chief tells them, look, we just got a $50,000 federal grant, man.
[02:10:35.832 --> 02:10:37.092]  We need, you know, this.
[02:10:37.192 --> 02:10:38.452]  You want raises, don't you?
[02:10:38.472 --> 02:10:39.753]  And you want to be able to move up?
[02:10:40.773 --> 02:10:42.274]  You want to move up the chain of command?
[02:10:42.294 --> 02:10:43.634]  We've got to expand the force.
[02:10:44.474 --> 02:10:46.015]  That's how you move up faster.
[02:10:46.915 --> 02:10:48.495]  And we've got to do it.
[02:10:48.535 --> 02:10:49.956]  It's a federal program.
[02:10:50.016 --> 02:10:50.116]  You...
[02:10:50.939 --> 02:10:52.080]  It's called Knock and Talk.
[02:10:52.100 --> 02:10:53.040]  Here's the brochure.
[02:10:53.100 --> 02:10:54.421]  Now you've got to go do it.
[02:10:55.581 --> 02:10:57.462]  All right, I'll do it, sir.
[02:10:57.923 --> 02:10:59.683]  I mean, as you destroy this country.
[02:11:00.104 --> 02:11:01.104]  It's like the checkpoints.
[02:11:01.784 --> 02:11:06.447]  Remember, Bill Clinton passed the National Seatbelt Initiative in 1998, $2.2 billion a year.
[02:11:07.787 --> 02:11:12.690]  And then suddenly the posters and the billboards, there's going to be full enforcement for DWI and seatbelts.
[02:11:13.183 --> 02:11:20.466]  Of course, part three of the plan said it's about training us to accept checkpoints to be searched for, quote, guns and contraband.
[02:11:20.967 --> 02:11:26.009]  They admit in the official Transportation Department document that it's about getting us used to being searched.
[02:11:26.629 --> 02:11:27.049]  Period.
[02:11:27.890 --> 02:11:40.756]  But for the public, it's a DWI, it's license checks, it's insurance checks, it's make sure you're wearing your seatbelt as if when you're backed up for 20 minutes at a checkpoint, you don't put your seatbelt on.
[02:11:40.796 --> 02:11:41.456]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:11:42.119 --> 02:11:47.681]  And I already wear my seatbelt, because I know it's better to wear one than not, but I don't need to have a checkpoint to make sure I do.
[02:11:48.141 --> 02:11:50.801]  No, the plan says it's about getting us used to checkpoints, period.
[02:11:51.582 --> 02:11:53.162]  And I talk to the police that did this.
[02:11:53.182 --> 02:11:54.603]  I mean, you see it, Police State 2000.
[02:11:54.983 --> 02:11:58.424]  I get out and start talking to them, and they come over and ask what's going on.
[02:11:58.444 --> 02:12:03.145]  And later I talk to police, you know, at restaurants and stuff, and they walk over and start talking to me and sit down.
[02:12:03.565 --> 02:12:04.525]  Happens all the time.
[02:12:05.426 --> 02:12:09.587]  Oh, you know, we hate doing that, Alex, but it's a federal grant.
[02:12:09.607 --> 02:12:10.167]  We've got to.
[02:12:11.192 --> 02:12:15.053]  Because the feds will give them a huge grant, and they spend 10% of it on the actual activity.
[02:12:16.614 --> 02:12:18.194]  Well, number one, that's not free money.
[02:12:18.234 --> 02:12:21.255]  That's state, county, and city money the feds took.
[02:12:21.675 --> 02:12:34.780]  Did you know, on average nationally, and I checked this years ago, it's probably worse now, but about 50 cents on the dollar that's taken at state, city, or county level actually goes for services.
[02:12:35.780 --> 02:12:36.060]  Okay?
[02:12:36.710 --> 02:12:42.491]  Do you know how much on average federally you get per dollar sent to Washington?
[02:12:43.651 --> 02:12:44.432]  29 cents.
[02:12:45.112 --> 02:12:48.912]  And, quote, federal services are always controlled.
[02:12:49.353 --> 02:12:56.774]  They put a penny in, and for a penny of federal money, you've got to do a dollar's worth of work to your whole infrastructure.
[02:12:56.854 --> 02:12:57.714]  It's a joke!
[02:12:58.774 --> 02:13:01.495]  This money came from the locales to begin with.
[02:13:03.436 --> 02:13:04.437]  And the feds are slick.
[02:13:04.477 --> 02:13:07.299]  They got state legislatures, I don't know, 15 years ago.
[02:13:08.379 --> 02:13:08.880]  More than that.
[02:13:08.900 --> 02:13:13.463]  It started in Florida, California, and Texas about 18 years ago.
[02:13:15.344 --> 02:13:17.745]  How long ago was the first Reagan administration?
[02:13:17.785 --> 02:13:19.506]  The end of the first Reagan administration?
[02:13:19.707 --> 02:13:20.047]  Wow!
[02:13:21.308 --> 02:13:21.968]  That was right around 1984.
[02:13:22.368 --> 02:13:24.670]  Asset forfeiture seizure went in.
[02:13:25.931 --> 02:13:27.892]  So that was 21 years ago.
[02:13:27.912 --> 02:13:28.192]  Ha ha ha!
[02:13:30.399 --> 02:13:32.601]  So to correct, it wasn't 15 or 18.
[02:13:32.681 --> 02:13:34.722]  It's 24 years.
[02:13:35.543 --> 02:13:36.884]  No, not 24.
[02:13:36.924 --> 02:13:38.646]  21, excuse me.
[02:13:38.666 --> 02:13:39.326]  21 years ago.
[02:13:41.027 --> 02:13:57.300]  And then they went and lobbied with all the states to where states passed laws that, well, if the police take a Corvette or a jet boat or a house or a bar or a business because it's drug-related, there doesn't even have to be a jury trial.
[02:13:58.281 --> 02:13:59.342]  They just get to take it.
[02:13:59.938 --> 02:14:03.401]  So that's a total violation of every canon of a free society.
[02:14:04.962 --> 02:14:27.240]  On top of it, but then they got the states to pass laws where if the police take an asset locally at the state level, and the units of the state, the county and city, then if it's done via the state, or done locally, what is it, like 95% goes in, depending on what state, it could be more or less,
[02:14:28.078 --> 02:14:31.920]  It goes into the state general fund and the police don't get it.
[02:14:33.380 --> 02:14:48.546]  But if they have a federal liaison as part of the MJTF, the Multi-Jurisdictional Task Force, then 85%, sometimes 90%, goes directly to that police agency.
[02:14:49.526 --> 02:14:56.749]  Now that's an incentive right there for booting, for bounty, for spoils, for loot.
[02:14:58.144 --> 02:15:02.408]  For literal prize money.
[02:15:03.269 --> 02:15:05.131]  That's how the British government did it with their ships.
[02:15:05.151 --> 02:15:08.314]  They got to keep basically the captain and his men about half the money.
[02:15:08.855 --> 02:15:10.596]  And so they were robbing everybody.
[02:15:11.157 --> 02:15:12.478]  That's part of the Revolutionary War.
[02:15:12.518 --> 02:15:14.540]  They were just robbing American ships for no reason.
[02:15:15.061 --> 02:15:17.143]  The 1812 War was over robbing ships.
[02:15:17.544 --> 02:15:19.766]  Just gangs of crooks that think it's normal.
[02:15:20.823 --> 02:15:27.931]  And so it corrupts your detectives, it corrupts your SWAT teams, it corrupts your higher echelon or elite officers.
[02:15:28.612 --> 02:15:29.833]  It federalizes them.
[02:15:29.853 --> 02:15:34.598]  I mean, why did the states allow the feds to lobby where the states just can't give them money?
[02:15:34.838 --> 02:15:35.619]  Which is bad enough.
[02:15:35.659 --> 02:15:36.280]  It's bad enough.
[02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:38.362]  The money should go into the general fund.
[02:15:38.963 --> 02:15:41.746]  And you shouldn't have asset forfeiture seizure to begin with.
[02:15:43.166 --> 02:15:44.426]  It's a recipe for disaster.
[02:15:44.466 --> 02:15:47.167]  But then, can't you put two plus two police?
[02:15:47.747 --> 02:15:51.008]  Don't you see how that's meant to federalize you, that you only get the money?
[02:15:51.028 --> 02:15:52.028]  And you know this is true.
[02:15:52.368 --> 02:15:53.089]  You know about this.
[02:15:53.609 --> 02:15:56.689]  If it's federal, that puts you under federal control.
[02:15:58.870 --> 02:15:59.950]  I get so sick of it.
[02:16:02.771 --> 02:16:06.392]  Let's go to... Who's up next?
[02:16:07.617 --> 02:16:08.738]  Daryl in Pennsylvania.
[02:16:08.758 --> 02:16:09.799]  Go ahead and thanks for calling.
[02:16:10.199 --> 02:16:10.860]  Hi, Alex.
[02:16:11.260 --> 02:16:26.712]  And before I give you two very short and interesting quotes about the former Archbishop of Munich, the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, since today's my birthday and I'd written a long letter about Waco and Oklahoma City April 19th, can I give you one short quote about Waco?
[02:16:27.492 --> 02:16:27.733]  Sure.
[02:16:27.753 --> 02:16:28.653]  We're going to talk about Waco.
[02:16:28.673 --> 02:16:28.954]  Go ahead.
[02:16:29.214 --> 02:16:29.554]  Okay.
[02:16:29.594 --> 02:16:30.995]  This is by a retired U.S.
[02:16:31.095 --> 02:16:34.558]  Air Force officer named John Salter, and I think it boils it all down.
[02:16:35.126 --> 02:16:50.736]  It says, a government which will turn its tanks upon its own people for any reason is a government with a taste for blood and a thirst for power and must either be smartly rebuked or blindly obeyed in deadly fear.
[02:16:50.916 --> 02:16:52.016]  Well, it's Tiananmen Square.
[02:16:52.777 --> 02:16:53.517]  All over again.
[02:16:53.537 --> 02:16:57.940]  Oh, but we had to save the children by barbecuing them.
[02:16:59.048 --> 02:17:08.530]  Yeah, the biggest thing in America that we all need to be careful of is if someone says the government needs to come in and save you, look out.
[02:17:09.050 --> 02:17:10.130]  Well, you don't want to be saved.
[02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:12.591]  You know, the Nazis were helping sanitize.
[02:17:12.631 --> 02:17:14.772]  They were just giving them showers, Daryl.
[02:17:15.152 --> 02:17:15.412]  Right.
[02:17:17.212 --> 02:17:17.792]  Can I hold over?
[02:17:17.812 --> 02:17:18.592]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:17:19.052 --> 02:17:20.313]  I want to hear what else you have to say.
[02:17:20.333 --> 02:17:21.293]  I don't want to cut you short.
[02:17:21.983 --> 02:17:28.627]  Then we'll get to Gary and Miles, and then I'm going to stop taking calls for a while and get into all of this news.
[02:17:28.667 --> 02:17:31.128]  And believe me, there is a lot of it.
[02:17:31.148 --> 02:17:40.833]  It'll be jam-packed, but he wants to comment on this cardinal who is now Benedict XVI, 78 years old, a new pope.
[02:17:45.868 --> 02:17:56.593]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:17:56.773 --> 02:18:04.376]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:18:04.597 --> 02:18:07.758]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:18:07.918 --> 02:18:08.298]  We're good to go.
[02:18:26.570 --> 02:18:32.538]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:18:32.758 --> 02:18:36.703]  Get the Perky Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:18:44.974 --> 02:18:45.834]  We're good to go.
[02:19:10.225 --> 02:19:10.825]  We're good to go.
[02:19:26.576 --> 02:19:28.757]  Just one call will put your life back on track.

[02:19:46.946 --> 02:19:49.307]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[02:19:49.567 --> 02:19:50.608]  The real money folks.
[02:19:53.914 --> 02:19:57.317]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:19:57.397 --> 02:19:59.259]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:05.485]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against a gold-backed euro.
[02:20:15.180 --> 02:20:20.802]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[02:20:21.402 --> 02:20:24.443]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[02:20:25.003 --> 02:20:30.145]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.

[02:20:46.616 --> 02:20:47.776]  All water isn't the same.
[02:20:48.036 --> 02:20:53.038]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[02:20:53.298 --> 02:20:55.899]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[02:20:56.099 --> 02:21:04.641]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[02:21:05.021 --> 02:21:13.467]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a higher vibration state.

[02:21:38.645 --> 02:21:42.386]  Or visit Aquanorthwest.com.
[02:21:49.810 --> 02:21:51.451]  All right, Daryl in Pennsylvania.
[02:21:51.571 --> 02:21:52.251]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:21:52.712 --> 02:21:53.432]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[02:21:53.472 --> 02:21:57.734]  And the two short quotes I'm going to give you about Ratzinger come from a book written in 1994.
[02:21:57.954 --> 02:21:58.835]  Keep that in mind.
[02:21:58.855 --> 02:21:59.455]  1994 by Dave Hunt.
[02:22:01.957 --> 02:22:03.837]  And it's called A Woman Rides the Beast.
[02:22:04.477 --> 02:22:09.698]  And the first quote is, he's talking about who the current head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith is.
[02:22:09.738 --> 02:22:13.059]  And by the way, folks, that was an office that had a name change in 1967.
[02:22:13.199 --> 02:22:18.920]  It used to be known as the Office of the Holy Inquisition.
[02:22:19.860 --> 02:22:29.442]  So he says, the current head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith is the former Archbishop of Munich, Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger.
[02:22:29.915 --> 02:22:38.419]  Whom Time Magazine has called the world's most powerful cardinal and the Catholic Church's chief enforcer of dogma.
[02:22:39.159 --> 02:22:56.646]  The second quote, Alex, is Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger, now in his third five-year term as the head of the modern equivalent of the Holy Inquisition, served in the military in Germany during the war, talking about World War II, though he saw no combat.
[02:22:57.253 --> 02:23:00.095]  By his own admission, he was aware of the Holocaust.
[02:23:00.775 --> 02:23:02.717]  No German could have been totally ignorant.
[02:23:03.277 --> 02:23:04.618]  And here's a quote from Ratzinger.
[02:23:04.918 --> 02:23:15.125]  The abyss of Hitlerism could not be overlooked, Hunt adds, yet he overlooked it when it would have cost him something to speak out against it.
[02:23:15.546 --> 02:23:22.971]  And Alex, whether we're Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, or whatever, there ought to be a red flag warning going up real big in front of our faces.
[02:23:23.031 --> 02:23:24.612]  Well, I mean, it's like Kirk Voltheim.
[02:23:25.399 --> 02:23:26.660]  To be Secretary General.
[02:23:27.081 --> 02:23:27.901]  It's like Arnold.
[02:23:27.981 --> 02:23:29.122]  It's the Bushes.
[02:23:29.182 --> 02:23:32.225]  It's the same thing over and over again.
[02:23:32.445 --> 02:23:38.130]  Again, I don't know enough about Ratzinger, but I had heard that and read that, the whole Nazi connection.
[02:23:38.271 --> 02:23:52.283]  Well, you know what's really scary, Alex, is this guy is the head of what was then called the Office of Holy Inquisition, had access to all the Vatican's archives on how to keep folks alive, string them out with medical doctors coming in to extend their torture, and
[02:23:52.879 --> 02:24:08.716]  And maybe one of your callers can call in and let us know if this guy was a high-level P2 Mason or was a Jesuit or was Jesuit trained, because I would kind of bet that that's a strong possibility, but hopefully one of the people out in the audience would know that.
[02:24:09.324 --> 02:24:11.105]  No, I've read all the things you just mentioned.
[02:24:11.425 --> 02:24:14.386]  I'm going to research it more, and then I'll talk about it.
[02:24:14.726 --> 02:24:16.667]  I wonder if he'll start calling for a New World Order.
[02:24:17.407 --> 02:24:26.191]  I've heard the media saying he's real conservative, but they were calling Pope John Paul II conservative on a lot of things he wasn't conservative.
[02:24:26.211 --> 02:24:35.935]  Well, you know, Alex, that's interesting that you would say that they were calling Pope John Paul II conservative, because the first thing John Paul II did when he got in was he protected...
[02:24:36.502 --> 02:24:43.882]  The murderers of Pope John Paul I. John Paul I was getting ready to clean out the Vatican when they murdered him on his 33rd day.
[02:24:45.040 --> 02:24:50.923]  I've gotten a list of the top P2 Mason people that were running the Vatican.
[02:24:51.143 --> 02:24:55.066]  I've seen a lot of evidence of that.
[02:24:55.226 --> 02:24:59.328]  They had that guy murdered to keep him from cleaning out the P2 Masons.
[02:24:59.828 --> 02:25:00.669]  I forget the name of it.
[02:25:01.089 --> 02:25:09.914]  It has been reported there's all this Masonic stuff now in the Pope John Paul II's quarters and all over the Vatican.
[02:25:11.255 --> 02:25:11.815]  It's weird.
[02:25:11.996 --> 02:25:12.696]  It's really weird.
[02:25:13.016 --> 02:25:17.460]  Yeah, but Alex, like I said, it's not a Protestant Catholic thing.
[02:25:17.680 --> 02:25:20.622]  We need to be aware that all of the mainline churches
[02:25:21.164 --> 02:25:23.426]  Have been heavily infiltrated by Masons.
[02:25:23.466 --> 02:25:24.226]  No, I know.
[02:25:24.426 --> 02:25:25.867]  Southern Baptists, the Methodists.
[02:25:25.887 --> 02:25:26.388]  No, I know.
[02:25:26.428 --> 02:25:30.991]  I've got Baptist churches and Catholic churches doing gun buyback days.
[02:25:31.111 --> 02:25:34.473]  And they all promote New World Order agendas.
[02:25:34.493 --> 02:25:35.053]  No, I know.
[02:25:35.113 --> 02:25:36.634]  So we'll see what Ratzinger does.
[02:25:36.754 --> 02:25:37.675]  One final thing, Alex.
[02:25:37.755 --> 02:25:44.900]  I got your latest video, and it's along the same lines as Masters of Terror and 9-1-1 Road to Tyranny.
[02:25:46.086 --> 02:25:53.332]  You do have the very best videos out there, and I'd urge everybody to buy them in lots of three so that they can get a reduction on the price.
[02:25:53.372 --> 02:25:56.214]  But those would be my three favorites right there.
[02:25:57.035 --> 02:25:59.577]  Well, I mean, I think Martial Law is my best video.
[02:25:59.597 --> 02:26:00.798]  It's really three films in one.
[02:26:00.838 --> 02:26:01.738]  I mean, what did you think of it?
[02:26:03.320 --> 02:26:04.020]  It's like the others.
[02:26:04.120 --> 02:26:05.181]  It moves super fast.
[02:26:05.261 --> 02:26:06.362]  It covers a lot of ground.
[02:26:06.722 --> 02:26:10.265]  And like I said, I love Masters of Terror because I'm a history buff.
[02:26:10.765 --> 02:26:15.309]  And you brought out about Nero and Hitler and how governments orchestrate terrorism.
[02:26:15.942 --> 02:26:16.362]  Well, thank you.
[02:26:16.383 --> 02:26:17.203]  God bless you, my friend.
[02:26:17.223 --> 02:26:19.185]  Speaking of that, I didn't plug it last hour.
[02:26:19.265 --> 02:26:21.627]  Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State is out.
[02:26:21.767 --> 02:26:22.047]  And it is...
[02:26:38.539 --> 02:26:52.203]  Three hours long on DVD, two hours, 35 minutes on VHS, covers the police state, the latest 9-11 information, and how this dark order of death out of Europe controls both political parties and what their true goals are.
[02:26:52.823 --> 02:27:03.126]  To must-see, go to infowars.com or prisonplanet.com to order Martial Law via the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[02:27:36.096 --> 02:27:36.998]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.498 --> 02:27:39.100]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.022 --> 02:27:42.706]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:48.115 --> 02:27:53.600]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:54.041 --> 02:27:58.265]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:58.505 --> 02:28:05.552]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:05.912 --> 02:28:12.038]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:12.178 --> 02:28:13.379]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:13.559 --> 02:28:14.060]  We're good to go.
[02:28:14.080 --> 02:28:14.580]  We're good to go.

[02:28:45.609 --> 02:28:51.856]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:51.996 --> 02:28:58.162]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.422 --> 02:29:06.811]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.111 --> 02:29:14.158]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.439 --> 02:29:19.284]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.484 --> 02:29:28.273]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs, ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.633 --> 02:29:36.542]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:30:05.937 --> 02:30:09.819]  The Compost Twin is the only composter with two 10-bushel bins on one machine.
[02:30:10.039 --> 02:30:14.501]  The barrels sit well off the ground and away from the pests that feast on your compost pile for Sunday dinner.
[02:30:14.661 --> 02:30:18.502]  Plus, mixing the compost is a breeze with the Compost Twin's easy-turn gear system.
[02:30:18.742 --> 02:30:24.945]  And with a second chamber, you can continually add kitchen scraps and garden waste without disturbing the composting process in the first chamber.

[02:30:37.969 --> 02:30:39.430]  That's 1-866-833-MANTIS.
[02:30:39.450 --> 02:30:40.030]  12 years ago...
[02:31:03.809 --> 02:31:17.196]  Just north of me, outside Waco, Texas, the Delta Force and the FBI hostage rescue team machine-gunned and set fire to a wooden church full of men, women, and children.
[02:31:17.536 --> 02:31:19.197]  And 80-plus people died.
[02:31:20.518 --> 02:31:25.861]  And then a few years later, 10 years ago to the day, 9.02 in the morning,
[02:31:30.968 --> 02:31:38.192]  Multiple bombs whipped through and blew the building outwards across the street, killing the children in the daycare center.
[02:31:38.632 --> 02:31:44.456]  The BATF told police when they showed up seconds after in full bomb gear that they'd been given a tip not to go to work that day.
[02:31:46.697 --> 02:31:49.779]  Police and others were ordered to lie and say BATF had been in the building.
[02:31:51.479 --> 02:31:53.961]  Some of the people that refused ended up having accidents.
[02:31:56.182 --> 02:31:59.464]  And of course, both these events were used as reasons to expand
[02:32:01.767 --> 02:32:09.410]  The Gestapo forces of this criminal government and as a pretext to restrict civil liberties and our God-given freedoms.
[02:32:12.972 --> 02:32:28.779]  So, quite a date in history, back in 1775, the British came to confiscate guns, the long rifles, the muskets, even cutlasses, and the ball and the powder and the wad, and even some small cannons.
[02:32:30.359 --> 02:32:41.323]  And the Minutemen responded, at that time, 2% of the population, by guerrilla warfare tactics, and the rest is history.
[02:32:41.343 --> 02:32:55.529]  And today, 230 years later, we have the government training its new generation of Redcoats to confiscate our guns.
[02:32:57.430 --> 02:32:59.651]  I just want to say that I'm sad for the Redcoats.
[02:33:01.232 --> 02:33:02.593]  I'm also sad for this country.
[02:33:05.396 --> 02:33:05.856]  All right.
[02:33:06.757 --> 02:33:11.741]  There's also today an FBI report highlights domestic terror experts warn of future Timothy McVeigh.
[02:33:13.422 --> 02:33:15.464]  And they're not worried about Al-Qaeda.
[02:33:15.484 --> 02:33:17.005]  They're not worried about LCA.
[02:33:17.025 --> 02:33:18.326]  They're not worried about the open borders.
[02:33:18.346 --> 02:33:21.409]  They're worried about homeschoolers and gun owners and Christians.
[02:33:21.449 --> 02:33:27.454]  I mean, you've seen the terror drills and the manuals and the flyers, and we've covered it, but there's a new one today.
[02:33:27.474 --> 02:33:30.096]  We're going to go to Gary and Mike and Kevin and
[02:33:31.330 --> 02:33:34.712]  Eric and others here in a few minutes, but I'm going to go ahead and plunge into the news now.
[02:33:34.732 --> 02:33:39.335]  Of course, you know global stocks have taken a dive across the planet.
[02:33:39.835 --> 02:33:40.676]  Things are not good.
[02:33:40.776 --> 02:33:49.521]  Globalization is shutting down the Western world, but the globalists have already moved their assets into China and India, so it doesn't really matter.
[02:33:51.282 --> 02:33:55.405]  USA Today, students paid for tattling on peers.
[02:33:56.852 --> 02:34:06.816]  Last month, school shootings in Minnesota have stirred interest and organized snitch programs that pay students for telling on classmates who carry guns or drugs or violate school rules.
[02:34:07.597 --> 02:34:10.038]  Yeah, I have these programs, even their local ads.
[02:34:10.078 --> 02:34:11.538]  They are in Austin, in Road to Tyranny.
[02:34:12.118 --> 02:34:16.260]  And they say, you know, report on people, report on drugs, report on whatever.
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:16.700]  You get $250.
[02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:20.662]  And they hand all the children their little tattletale card.
[02:34:21.388 --> 02:34:25.010]  And they ask him, what do your parents have in their medicine cabinet?
[02:34:25.391 --> 02:34:27.452]  Does your mother roll her own cigarettes?
[02:34:28.113 --> 02:34:29.393]  And parents put up with that.
[02:34:30.974 --> 02:34:31.615]  Unbelievable.
[02:34:31.655 --> 02:34:42.042]  Last week in central Georgia, the Houston County School Board became the state's first school district to enroll in the National Student Crime Stoppers Program.
[02:34:43.122 --> 02:34:45.064]  Don't take a bite out of the Constitution.
[02:34:45.304 --> 02:34:46.865]  I'm McGruff the Nazi Dog.
[02:34:47.908 --> 02:34:53.877]  Started in 83, students can earn up to $500 for alerting school officials about firearms.
[02:34:54.498 --> 02:34:59.987]  They can get up to $100 for fingering classmates involved in vandalism, theft, or drugs.
[02:35:01.531 --> 02:35:11.995]  Another Georgia school, Model High School in Rome, said last week it implemented a program that pays students up to $100 for information about thefts, drugs, or guns on school property.
[02:35:12.515 --> 02:35:18.518]  It's not a reaction to anything that's happening on campus, says Tim Hensley, spokesman for Floyd County Schools.
[02:35:18.538 --> 02:35:21.159]  It's a proactive step from the principal's standpoint.
[02:35:21.899 --> 02:35:22.119]  Yes.
[02:35:22.799 --> 02:35:29.402]  Don't tell the teacher about somebody who's got a gun because you want to do the right thing.
[02:35:31.081 --> 02:35:32.541]  Do it because you get paid.
[02:35:33.922 --> 02:35:34.542]  That's wrong.
[02:35:35.702 --> 02:35:37.462]  I mean, let me tell you something, folks.
[02:35:39.023 --> 02:35:43.644]  Up at this school in Minnesota, he was walking around for a month saying, I'm going to kill everybody.
[02:35:44.604 --> 02:35:45.524]  I'm going to shoot you.
[02:35:46.564 --> 02:35:52.185]  But because his grandfather was a senior police officer, a captain on the police force, he was untouchable.
[02:35:54.166 --> 02:35:54.546]  If his...
[02:35:55.982 --> 02:36:01.707]  Grandfather, his parents are dead, wouldn't have been a top cop, who he killed, by the way, along with his girlfriend.
[02:36:03.588 --> 02:36:04.649]  Then this wouldn't have happened.
[02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:07.812]  And the armed guards there didn't save anybody.
[02:36:08.872 --> 02:36:11.635]  So you can turn everything into a police state.
[02:36:11.675 --> 02:36:15.258]  It doesn't protect you from real nutcases or Prozac heads.
[02:36:16.599 --> 02:36:17.600]  It never does.
[02:36:18.200 --> 02:36:19.361]  It never will.
[02:36:20.642 --> 02:36:21.783]  And everybody knows that.
[02:36:23.263 --> 02:36:40.292]  The answer, if you really want to turn the government training camps into armed camps, and they already are prisons, and not have the doors automatically locked, and not have lockdowns and all this garbage that makes it more dangerous, by the way, than schools, then you would simply arm the principals and arm teachers who wanted to be armed with instant access pistol safes.
[02:36:40.312 --> 02:36:49.237]  They had a case in Louisiana, the guy running around shooting people, and the principal stopped it real fast, had to go out to his car, then he got in trouble for stopping it.
[02:36:50.618 --> 02:36:51.959]  He should have stayed outside for
[02:36:52.665 --> 02:36:54.006]  Four hours and 15 minutes.
[02:36:54.026 --> 02:36:55.486]  Look at the SWAT teams at Columbine.
[02:36:56.507 --> 02:37:00.428]  The SWAT teams were doing that because they were panicking because they had popped a few of the kids in their haste.
[02:37:02.149 --> 02:37:04.350]  Four hours and 15 minutes and people bled to death.
[02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:06.671]  Unbelievable.
[02:37:07.231 --> 02:37:07.891]  Some good news.
[02:37:07.971 --> 02:37:10.692]  Christians challenged Pennsylvania's hate law.
[02:37:10.892 --> 02:37:13.133]  Remember the folks facing 45 years in prison?
[02:37:13.633 --> 02:37:14.754]  Mark Diner and others.
[02:37:16.354 --> 02:37:17.655]  Michael Markavage and others.
[02:37:19.272 --> 02:37:27.557]  They were facing 40-plus years in prison for praying, and the cops would say, unauthorized, move over here, move the designated protest area.
[02:37:28.237 --> 02:37:35.261]  And they did, and they went ahead and arrested them, and George Bush's Justice Department advised them to throw the book at them for terrorism.
[02:37:35.902 --> 02:37:44.707]  Because by praying, that could have incited the gay rights protest demonstration to attack them, and it's their fault if they get attacked.
[02:37:46.207 --> 02:37:52.211]  I've had a million Mon March people hit me on the head with signs, throw water on our cameras, and the cops threaten to arrest us.
[02:37:52.231 --> 02:37:53.372]  They go, well, you're making them do that.
[02:37:55.594 --> 02:37:55.894]  Okay.
[02:37:56.394 --> 02:37:58.956]  I mean, I just love this new psychology.
[02:37:58.976 --> 02:38:00.417]  They've got a petition for review.
[02:38:00.437 --> 02:38:14.908]  It was filed April 15, 2005, in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania on behalf of the Christians against Edward G. Rendell, governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and it lists everybody else who's trying to have hate crime, hate speech laws.
[02:38:16.539 --> 02:38:21.303]  Carl Rove is panicking because Bush's approval rating is in the low 40s.
[02:38:22.343 --> 02:38:24.005]  It's always been in the low 40s.
[02:38:25.426 --> 02:38:29.108]  I mean, you've got roughly half the people that voted, voted for Bush.
[02:38:29.869 --> 02:38:32.871]  The other half that voted, voted for Kerry.
[02:38:33.491 --> 02:38:39.516]  And if half the population voted, that's one quarter of the public likes Bush, or voted for him.
[02:38:39.936 --> 02:38:42.218]  One quarter liked his cousin, Kerry.
[02:38:43.300 --> 02:38:46.241]  And the other half of people know it's all a fraud.
[02:38:46.881 --> 02:38:47.941]  So you have polls.
[02:38:49.442 --> 02:38:53.863]  They do this to give the illusion of ebb and flow, the illusion of choice.
[02:38:53.903 --> 02:38:54.623]  That's all this is.
[02:38:55.023 --> 02:38:56.924]  Schwarzenegger's polls are low right now.
[02:38:56.944 --> 02:38:57.724]  They'll go back up.
[02:38:58.904 --> 02:38:59.865]  This is all staged.
[02:39:00.705 --> 02:39:02.125]  Can't believe the polls to begin with.
[02:39:04.466 --> 02:39:07.107]  The particular polls they use, like Gallup Poll and others.
[02:39:08.147 --> 02:39:11.068]  The instant polls they do, and the polls...
[02:39:12.269 --> 02:39:19.272]  That Zogby engages in are more often accurate and not controlled, but those don't get publicized.
[02:39:19.312 --> 02:39:25.795]  When 90% of people in a CNN poll believe the government was involved in 9-11, they shut up about the poll real quick and pull it.
[02:39:26.275 --> 02:39:30.017]  When 92% believe the government killed Kennedy, they pull the poll real quick.
[02:39:31.617 --> 02:39:33.338]  Alright, let's continue here.
[02:39:34.145 --> 02:39:34.405]  U.S.
[02:39:34.465 --> 02:39:38.447]  forces abused and tortured female detainees in Iraq.
[02:39:38.967 --> 02:39:44.250]  Iraqi female detainees say they have been illegally detained, raped, and sexually humiliated by U.S.
[02:39:44.310 --> 02:39:45.371]  occupation forces.
[02:39:45.891 --> 02:39:47.592]  There's photos of all this in video.
[02:39:48.232 --> 02:39:50.953]  One female detainee identified herself as Norse at the U.S.
[02:39:50.973 --> 02:39:56.336]  soldiers at Iraq's Abu Ghraib, raped women, and in many occasions forced them to strip naked in public.
[02:39:56.756 --> 02:40:00.298]  She also said they made many female detainees get pregnant.
[02:40:01.129 --> 02:40:06.432]  The classified investigation launched... Yeah, they have all these blue-eyed and black babies.
[02:40:07.012 --> 02:40:09.534]  You know, white babies and black babies.
[02:40:09.554 --> 02:40:11.495]  Iraqi babies.
[02:40:12.215 --> 02:40:14.396]  The classified investigation launched by the U.S.
[02:40:14.456 --> 02:40:20.960]  Army led by Major General Antonio Tagumba informed NOR's account and said the U.S.
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:23.921]  Guard sexually abused female detainees at Abu Ghraib.
[02:40:24.242 --> 02:40:25.882]  Yeah, they rape them in front of their husbands.
[02:40:26.863 --> 02:40:27.703]  You're going to talk.
[02:40:28.124 --> 02:40:30.605]  I hate doing this, but it's for my country.
[02:40:33.052 --> 02:40:36.773]  I mean, that's the type of individuals we're talking about.
[02:40:36.913 --> 02:40:41.515]  When we get your guns, we're going to have our way with all of you.
[02:40:41.535 --> 02:40:43.295]  I mean, that's really what we're facing.
[02:40:55.612 --> 02:40:57.113]  I did it for my country.
[02:40:57.153 --> 02:40:59.354]  We were ordered to rape the women, which they were.
[02:40:59.894 --> 02:41:03.937]  But they hired federal prison guards with bad records to begin with to go do this.
[02:41:03.957 --> 02:41:07.139]  I mean, we're worried about the Iraqis.
[02:41:07.339 --> 02:41:07.699]  I am.
[02:41:07.779 --> 02:41:12.101]  But, folks, people get beaten to death every week in this country in the prisons.
[02:41:12.942 --> 02:41:15.083]  You can go, well, they're all a bunch of criminals.
[02:41:15.103 --> 02:41:17.925]  Well, wait until you're in there for no reason.
[02:41:18.565 --> 02:41:20.506]  Because they claim you didn't file your taxes right.
[02:41:21.856 --> 02:41:29.201]  70% of people in low and medium security prisons, 70% are non-violent offenders.
[02:41:30.682 --> 02:41:31.042]  Okay?
[02:41:32.083 --> 02:41:35.986]  And on average, they keep non-violent offenders in prison longer than violent offenders.
[02:41:36.727 --> 02:41:38.188]  In all the Western world.
[02:41:38.268 --> 02:41:38.568]  Why?
[02:41:39.129 --> 02:41:42.051]  Because they need the vicious ones out there creating the fear.
[02:41:42.571 --> 02:41:43.592]  I've got documents on that.
[02:41:44.489 --> 02:41:46.550]  And I've got a news article on today out of England.
[02:41:46.570 --> 02:41:52.031]  A scandal of psychopath knife been forced to kill, freed to kill four times.
[02:41:52.591 --> 02:42:03.474]  He'd already killed somebody and told the cops he was going to kill, and then he went and murdered four people and worshipped Satan and bited bloody chunks out of them and stabbed them and slaughtered them and kept their bodies in trunks.
[02:42:04.755 --> 02:42:12.477]  Four-time killer Mark Hobson was revealed yesterday as the flesh-eating monster who savagely murdered his girlfriend, her twin, and an aged couple.
[02:42:13.004 --> 02:42:14.785]  And it gets into how they knew and let him go.
[02:42:14.805 --> 02:42:19.426]  I mean, this is the type of... Folks, I've got three articles like this from the U.S.
[02:42:19.446 --> 02:42:21.286]  today.
[02:42:23.147 --> 02:42:27.968]  But I don't know how the sickos out there legitimize torture.
[02:42:28.508 --> 02:42:29.589]  I've heard you on talk radio.
[02:42:30.849 --> 02:42:32.209]  Even alternative news, supposedly.
[02:42:32.389 --> 02:42:34.650]  Oh, we've got to do this to save our troops.
[02:42:35.670 --> 02:42:36.430]  Oh, the troops.
[02:42:36.531 --> 02:42:37.791]  Somebody's got to do it.
[02:42:38.551 --> 02:42:41.712]  It's for America raping women in front of their husbands.
[02:42:42.802 --> 02:42:45.084]  And yes, even children.
[02:42:46.586 --> 02:42:47.567]  What happened to us?
[02:42:48.608 --> 02:42:52.211]  But Kiefer Sutherland tortures people on 24 every episode.
[02:42:53.052 --> 02:42:57.937]  And on Threat Matrix and CSI Miami they do, so it must be okay!
[02:42:57.957 --> 02:43:00.380]  I mean, it's on TV!
[02:43:01.461 --> 02:43:02.802]  And here's the propaganda.
[02:43:02.882 --> 02:43:03.303]  This is...
[02:43:06.087 --> 02:43:06.908]  This is U.S.
[02:43:06.928 --> 02:43:11.211]  News & World Report, the CSI effect, how TV is driving jury verdicts all across America.
[02:43:11.612 --> 02:43:13.073]  And this is just one example.
[02:43:14.514 --> 02:43:16.015]  And I'm glad they're finally pointing this out.
[02:43:17.576 --> 02:43:21.099]  But, of course, they do it in a bad way, because it's not evil enough, is the problem.
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:27.064]  It says juries are letting people go free, because CSI shows them how they have all this...
[02:43:28.257 --> 02:43:36.239]  Data gathering systems for DNA and stuff, and then other departments can't do it, and people expect it, so they can't get the convictions.
[02:43:37.139 --> 02:43:39.280]  Because people are believing TV is real.
[02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:42.000]  See, there's also unseen problems.
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:45.101]  Of course, their answer is more money for the crime lab funding.
[02:43:45.601 --> 02:43:50.022]  And by all... I mean, to be fair to Kit R. Rowan...
[02:43:51.468 --> 02:43:55.769]  Who wrote this article, he admits how the crime labs frame everybody, too.
[02:43:56.090 --> 02:43:58.070]  So he's like, don't believe the crime labs anyways.
[02:43:58.110 --> 02:43:59.591]  Just go ahead and convict everybody.
[02:43:59.931 --> 02:44:02.732]  So see how they spin the truth for themselves?
[02:44:03.892 --> 02:44:05.093]  Don't believe the crime labs.
[02:44:05.113 --> 02:44:06.893]  They're already framing everybody anyways.
[02:44:07.233 --> 02:44:08.334]  Just go ahead and convict.
[02:44:09.494 --> 02:44:10.915]  What?
[02:44:10.975 --> 02:44:12.935]  And it actually says that here.
[02:44:14.136 --> 02:44:20.198]  Sandra Anderson with Eagle, her dog, her cadaver civic dog, before she admitted to planning evidence,
[02:44:20.848 --> 02:44:24.709]  Robert Blake lights up after jurors voted to quit.
[02:44:25.109 --> 02:44:27.890]  I mean, folks, crime labs, all they do is frame.
[02:44:27.970 --> 02:44:29.271]  Because, number one, they're lazy.
[02:44:29.291 --> 02:44:29.991]  They don't have the money.
[02:44:30.471 --> 02:44:33.432]  The Houston crime lab, no one was ever found innocent unless it was a cop.
[02:44:34.372 --> 02:44:35.232]  Thousands framed.
[02:44:35.293 --> 02:44:35.753]  It's admitted.
[02:44:36.693 --> 02:44:40.714]  In Dallas, they just throw bags of chalk in your car, take your car, take your house, no drugs.
[02:44:41.074 --> 02:44:43.335]  The DA indicts you.
[02:44:44.015 --> 02:44:46.036]  The crime lab certifies it as cocaine.
[02:44:46.076 --> 02:44:46.456]  It's over.
[02:44:50.106 --> 02:44:51.167]  And that's an example.
[02:44:51.487 --> 02:44:53.308]  People watch TV and they believe it.
[02:44:54.048 --> 02:44:56.189]  Another example is all these judge shows.
[02:44:56.770 --> 02:44:58.190]  There's dozens of them over the years.
[02:44:58.570 --> 02:45:01.552]  Where it's one judge screaming at somebody, going, answer my question.
[02:45:01.972 --> 02:45:03.533]  Where they teach you there's no Bill of Rights.
[02:45:04.193 --> 02:45:06.835]  Then the average person thinks court is just a judge.
[02:45:07.195 --> 02:45:17.720]  Now the Bar Association says get rid of juries, and the average person doesn't think you have a right to a trial by jury, with a jury, and suddenly they're getting rid of jury trials in this country.
[02:45:17.880 --> 02:45:19.081]  Judges are just saying no jury.
[02:45:20.256 --> 02:45:20.996]  There's no law.
[02:45:21.096 --> 02:45:21.917]  It's totally illegal.
[02:45:21.937 --> 02:45:22.637]  They just say it.
[02:45:23.478 --> 02:45:24.358]  First case in U.S.
[02:45:24.418 --> 02:45:28.620]  history I know of, Judge Walter E. Smith in 1999 with the Davidian Civil Trial.
[02:45:29.841 --> 02:45:30.101]  Okay.
[02:45:31.661 --> 02:45:33.802]  Let's go to calls here, and then I'll get back into the news.
[02:45:34.143 --> 02:45:34.823]  Who's up first?
[02:45:36.844 --> 02:45:37.404]  That has been it.
[02:45:38.485 --> 02:45:38.925]  Who's there?
[02:45:40.306 --> 02:45:41.286]  Gary in Tennessee.
[02:45:41.326 --> 02:45:42.026]  Go ahead, Gary.
[02:45:42.307 --> 02:45:42.627]  Hey, Alex.
[02:45:42.647 --> 02:45:43.027]  How are you?
[02:45:43.287 --> 02:45:43.687]  Pretty good.
[02:45:44.628 --> 02:45:45.968]  Here's your news scoop.
[02:45:46.028 --> 02:45:49.350]  Here about an hour and a half ago, an hour and 45 minutes ago, I had two...
[02:45:51.542 --> 02:45:54.483]  Apache helicopters circling my home.
[02:45:54.863 --> 02:45:58.224]  Yeah, in fact, you've been holding that entire time, and I didn't know until later.
[02:45:58.624 --> 02:46:00.844]  Actually, the fellow answering the phone heard them, yeah.
[02:46:01.264 --> 02:46:06.186]  Right, and what they'd done, they circled the house for a good couple of minutes.
[02:46:06.626 --> 02:46:10.607]  Once I come outside, I was in there in the process of getting some newsletters made up.
[02:46:11.947 --> 02:46:16.868]  I heard the choppers, and I come out, and I come out here in the yard to see what was going on.
[02:46:17.788 --> 02:46:19.329]  Well, they decided to descend.
[02:46:20.785 --> 02:46:24.406]  And get closer, and they were right over the top of me, boy.
[02:46:25.227 --> 02:46:26.267]  Less than 50 feet.
[02:46:26.307 --> 02:46:28.568]  I wish I'd have known that at the time we'd have put you on.
[02:46:28.588 --> 02:46:31.009]  You were outside with your cordless phone, right?
[02:46:31.069 --> 02:46:33.009]  Right, and everywhere I moved, they moved.
[02:46:34.190 --> 02:46:35.030]  So what were they doing?
[02:46:35.830 --> 02:46:37.791]  I don't know, but last night I had a little incident.
[02:46:37.851 --> 02:46:46.034]  I was out, and I got back about 11 p.m., and my son was awoken by someone outside he thought was me.
[02:46:46.074 --> 02:46:49.535]  He was going to come and lock the door, and he looked out, and it wasn't me getting out of a car.
[02:46:50.612 --> 02:46:52.433]  And he saw someone standing beside a car.
[02:46:53.894 --> 02:46:56.095]  And when he looked up, there was someone standing right there.
[02:46:56.115 --> 02:46:56.915]  Let me guess something.
[02:46:57.315 --> 02:46:58.996]  You live on a rural area.
[02:46:59.756 --> 02:47:01.257]  Well, I live out in a little country park.
[02:47:01.897 --> 02:47:02.818]  A little small town.
[02:47:03.298 --> 02:47:05.319]  You've got a valuable piece of property, don't you?
[02:47:05.659 --> 02:47:05.879]  Right.
[02:47:06.860 --> 02:47:08.841]  How many acres you got?
[02:47:09.501 --> 02:47:14.904]  I'd say there was approximately 10, 15 acres.
[02:47:16.184 --> 02:47:17.465]  Is it by a major road?
[02:47:18.359 --> 02:47:18.679]  Excuse me?
[02:47:19.119 --> 02:47:20.299]  Is it by a major road?
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:21.540]  It's by a major highway.
[02:47:21.580 --> 02:47:22.200]  Highway 13.
[02:47:22.660 --> 02:47:22.860]  Oh.
[02:47:23.920 --> 02:47:25.241]  Is that road being expanded?
[02:47:25.681 --> 02:47:26.181]  Yes, it is.
[02:47:26.201 --> 02:47:27.261]  Bridges are being redone.
[02:47:28.561 --> 02:47:30.442]  Being doubled up and made more sturdy.
[02:47:31.302 --> 02:47:36.963]  They're making... Well, let me tell you, just from the past, and you should take this very serious.
[02:47:37.203 --> 02:47:37.524]  I will.
[02:47:37.704 --> 02:47:40.444]  Were there any type of pods on the bottom of those helicopters?
[02:47:40.924 --> 02:47:41.324]  There was.
[02:47:42.765 --> 02:47:43.885]  Was it like a glass dome?
[02:47:44.125 --> 02:47:44.285]  Yep.
[02:47:45.585 --> 02:47:46.646]  I mean... On one side, on the side...
[02:47:49.051 --> 02:47:49.651]  Of the choppers.
[02:47:51.012 --> 02:47:53.774]  They had some kind of equipment, I couldn't tell really.
[02:47:53.814 --> 02:47:59.677]  Well, just so you know, 90% of the time was probably Cobras, not Apaches.
[02:48:00.077 --> 02:48:01.598]  No, these were Apaches.
[02:48:01.978 --> 02:48:02.618]  Wow, Apaches.
[02:48:02.718 --> 02:48:03.879]  These were Apaches.
[02:48:04.059 --> 02:48:10.863]  Generally, they have infrared scanners that can see every light bulb in your house.
[02:48:10.963 --> 02:48:11.183]  Right.
[02:48:11.423 --> 02:48:18.047]  And they see an array of, say, eight lights against eight lights lined up in your attic or your basement.
[02:48:18.067 --> 02:48:18.207]  Right.
[02:48:18.795 --> 02:48:20.136]  Then they SWAT team you.
[02:48:20.476 --> 02:48:27.539]  They were probably scanning every area in the general vicinity so they could asset, forfeit, or seize.
[02:48:28.180 --> 02:48:29.640]  The military does the scan.
[02:48:30.141 --> 02:48:31.241]  They call in the police.
[02:48:31.941 --> 02:48:35.983]  And then the local cops get your property and build a gas station on the highway.
[02:48:36.544 --> 02:48:40.205]  Well, I got another story for you that happened last night I think is part of this.
[02:48:40.846 --> 02:48:41.906]  Okay, well, stay there.
[02:48:42.727 --> 02:48:43.487]  They want your property.
[02:48:45.879 --> 02:48:50.221]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.381 --> 02:48:54.823]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.

[02:51:27.543 --> 02:51:28.063]  But John Harmon...
[02:51:56.134 --> 02:52:05.158]  I had a guest on at the time, so you didn't tell me about it at the time, but he was on the phone while this gentleman, Gary, in Tennessee, was out in his yard, and he heard these helicopters.
[02:52:06.279 --> 02:52:08.340]  John Harmon, running the show, describe what you heard.
[02:52:09.260 --> 02:52:16.563]  Well, it sounded like the helicopters were... must have been like 50 feet over the house, so it was pretty loud.
[02:52:17.904 --> 02:52:22.186]  And, yeah, so... Well, thanks for that information.
[02:52:23.326 --> 02:52:24.066]  Going back to...
[02:52:25.672 --> 02:52:26.673]  Gary in Tennessee.
[02:52:26.693 --> 02:52:27.673]  Finish up real quick, Gary.
[02:52:27.693 --> 02:52:41.040]  Alright, last night there was a little movement going around here in our neighborhood, I guess, because our neighbors had called it a law, which just 20 minutes after this happened, I had come in and my son had told me that there was someone here in our yard, and he described them.
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:42.420]  Now, we know what's been going on.
[02:52:42.480 --> 02:52:46.162]  I've been watching this for over 10 years, and I've taught my kids this very well.
[02:52:46.682 --> 02:52:51.985]  And he said that the guy was wearing a black ski mask and was dressed in black or dark clothing.
[02:52:52.580 --> 02:52:54.081]  I mean, he was looking right out the window at him.
[02:52:54.341 --> 02:52:56.663]  And why had your neighbors called the law?
[02:52:57.164 --> 02:53:08.712]  They had been hearing different activity here close by their homes, and I was outside with a flashlight and armed that way, searching around the house and the fields.
[02:53:09.213 --> 02:53:15.678]  Well, the military does drills against real houses, against real people, and it's more of this despicable...
[02:53:16.340 --> 02:53:17.842]  Despicable stuff that's going on.
[02:53:17.862 --> 02:53:19.004]  I wish they'd go down to the border.
[02:53:19.484 --> 02:53:20.866]  Call us as it develops, Gary.
[02:53:21.247 --> 02:53:21.908]  All right.
[02:53:21.928 --> 02:53:27.155]  This here, I think this might have to do with the stink I've been starting up here in our county because this is the county they've been trying to put the federal prison in.
[02:53:27.825 --> 02:53:28.886]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:53:29.126 --> 02:53:34.191]  Yeah, I mean, either they want your property, because you know, you're rural, you live by a big road.
[02:53:34.731 --> 02:53:45.100]  I mean, we've had cases, this has been on the national news, where cops come to a house, kill somebody, and take their, you know, 700 acres for themselves, or if it's 10 acres right on the road, it's asset forfeiture seizure.
[02:53:45.380 --> 02:53:46.701]  I don't think it has anything to do with the land.
[02:53:46.741 --> 02:53:48.523]  I believe it has to do with what I've been doing around here.
[02:53:49.232 --> 02:53:50.992]  Because I have been stirring up a lot of stink.
[02:53:51.513 --> 02:53:53.233]  Well, the key is stir up even more.
[02:53:53.513 --> 02:53:53.973]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:53:53.993 --> 02:53:54.433]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:54.473 --> 02:53:56.594]  They're the ones that wear black masks and hide in the bushes.
[02:53:56.974 --> 02:53:57.654]  They're the criminals.
[02:53:57.674 --> 02:53:58.775]  They should be ashamed of themselves.
[02:53:59.295 --> 02:54:00.475]  Miles in California.
[02:54:00.535 --> 02:54:01.355]  Miles, go ahead.
[02:54:02.156 --> 02:54:02.856]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:02.956 --> 02:54:03.896]  Thanks for taking my call.
[02:54:03.916 --> 02:54:05.156]  I was going to call Reason Reef.
[02:54:05.176 --> 02:54:09.137]  The reason why I called was I was just going to comment on the new pope that they got.
[02:54:10.758 --> 02:54:10.938]  Yes.
[02:54:11.358 --> 02:54:17.800]  Him being from Germany, one, I mean, when people think of Germany, what's the first thing they think of?
[02:54:17.940 --> 02:54:18.540]  Adolf Hitler.
[02:54:18.939 --> 02:54:22.160]  And then at the same time, he was supposedly in the German Army.
[02:54:22.180 --> 02:54:23.260]  Yeah, that's what I heard.
[02:54:23.340 --> 02:54:25.601]  But, you know, really, if you look at it, now...
[02:54:46.809 --> 02:54:49.731]  Since Pope John Paul II, he apologized to the Jews.
[02:54:49.771 --> 02:54:54.735]  Now they've got a pope now that's Jewish.
[02:54:55.676 --> 02:54:57.818]  I'm going to check into it, Miles.
[02:54:57.878 --> 02:54:59.199]  Unfortunately, I'm flat out of time.
[02:54:59.219 --> 02:55:00.380]  I'm going to cram two more in here.
[02:55:00.680 --> 02:55:01.921]  Kevin in Boston, then Eric.
[02:55:01.961 --> 02:55:02.542]  Kevin, go ahead.
[02:55:04.423 --> 02:55:04.823]  Hi, Alex.
[02:55:04.863 --> 02:55:05.964]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:55:06.184 --> 02:55:06.684]  Yes, sir.
[02:55:07.064 --> 02:55:14.307]  First, just on that last call, I believe it was Lustiger was the Cardinal who they thought would be Jewish, not Cardinal Ratzinger.
[02:55:14.767 --> 02:55:26.492]  But on a previous call, there was a book somebody referred to about the P2 names on John Paul I, and the book I think he was referring to is called In God's Name, and it's by David Yallow.
[02:55:27.252 --> 02:55:28.793]  My first point that I...
[02:55:29.301 --> 02:55:32.163]  ...was calling in about was Bill Maher's comment on illegal immigration.
[02:55:32.203 --> 02:55:44.971]  My counterpoint is this, that even if you were granted the fallacy of his argument that these illegal aliens were coming to do jobs that no one else wanted, the cost of putting them into our school system, into our medical system, far outweighs any benefits.
[02:55:45.772 --> 02:55:47.813]  It's $3 billion a year in California alone.
[02:55:48.113 --> 02:55:48.713]  Absolutely.
[02:55:48.873 --> 02:55:54.197]  And Father Gruner, the big thing about Ratzinger is not only was he in the Nazi youth, but that was compulsory.
[02:55:54.917 --> 02:55:55.818]  That was the only thing.
[02:55:56.983 --> 02:56:04.168]  He was the Cardinal who suppressed the Fatima secret and who's tried to say that John Paul being shot was the third secret.
[02:56:04.228 --> 02:56:07.409]  We know that it has to be something much more... All right, out of time.
[02:56:07.530 --> 02:56:09.671]  Eric in San Diego, you've got 30 seconds.
[02:56:11.872 --> 02:56:12.693]  Hey, sorry about that.
[02:56:12.773 --> 02:56:15.954]  Hey, I want to know the Illuminati.
[02:56:16.615 --> 02:56:19.537]  Sir, do you honestly think there's going to be any way that we can actually destroy them?
[02:56:20.577 --> 02:56:22.238]  We're going to... We have to fight them.
[02:56:22.278 --> 02:56:23.339]  We have to stand up against them.
[02:56:23.359 --> 02:56:25.360]  We have to say no to all their programs and yes...
[02:56:26.138 --> 02:56:27.220]  We can stand up.
[02:56:27.240 --> 02:56:29.384]  I mean, if we never do stand up, we're going to lose.
[02:56:29.864 --> 02:56:31.046]  All we can do is fight.
[02:56:31.347 --> 02:56:32.469]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:32.509 --> 02:56:33.070]  Back tomorrow.
[02:56:33.230 --> 02:56:33.651]  God bless.
