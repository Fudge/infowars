[00:00:05.882 --> 00:00:06.523]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.183 --> 00:00:08.244]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.964 --> 00:00:10.065]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:11.526]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.287 --> 00:00:13.147]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.167 --> 00:00:17.510]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.031 --> 00:00:22.114]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:25.574 --> 00:00:28.555]  We're good to go.
[00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:44.953]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:45.013 --> 00:00:47.634]  It is Thursday, the 8th day of December 2005.
[00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:49.555]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:52.616]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:52.696 --> 00:01:07.220]  We don't have any guests today because, again, I have so much news and information I want to personally cover, and I want to open the phones up again for first-time callers or individuals that have not called in the last three or four months.
[00:01:08.197 --> 00:01:20.427]  That is, we want people who do not call in frequently, or people who have been unable to call in, who've been trying for the last six, seven months, or individuals who have never called before.
[00:01:21.328 --> 00:01:29.915]  And I'm going to do everything in my power to control myself and to not go into preacher mode today, because I've got a lot that needs to be said, a lot that needs to be covered.
[00:01:30.835 --> 00:01:35.399]  And we're going to attempt to get that job done.
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.521]  Look at this article here.
[00:01:39.444 --> 00:01:46.788]  This was carried by several major newspapers in the United States and Counterpunch has written an article about it.
[00:01:47.508 --> 00:01:48.509]  I am sullied.
[00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.131]  Suicide before dishonor in occupied Iraq.
[00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:58.814]  I cannot support a mission that leads to corruption, human rights abuses, and liars.
[00:01:59.014 --> 00:01:59.735]  I am sullied.
[00:01:59.755 --> 00:02:02.796]  I came to serve honorably and feel dishonored.
[00:02:03.216 --> 00:02:06.178]  Death before dishonor anymore.
[00:02:07.218 --> 00:02:07.779]  And that was
[00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.890]  Colonel Ted S. Schwesthusing.
[00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.291]  I believe I'm pronouncing that correctly.
[00:02:14.891 --> 00:02:16.371]  And I'm reading his military record.
[00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:17.212]  It's exemplary.
[00:02:18.092 --> 00:02:22.593]  He was a Special Forces soldier back in the 80s, fighting communists all over Latin America.
[00:02:23.374 --> 00:02:24.354]  He was a conservative.
[00:02:25.574 --> 00:02:26.635]  And he was
[00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:41.123]  No, he committed suicide, and there's another article here showing that military psychiatrists are puzzled by the suicide rate in Iraq, saying that it makes little sense in comparison with those conflicts in the past.
[00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:50.506]  That's because they know that suicide actually goes down in a war, in a combat zone, because the survival mechanism, it says, kicks in.
[00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:55.047]  We're having record levels of suicides in Iraq.
[00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.360]  Now, a lot of these are people that don't play ball, that don't go along with raping women and children.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.341]  Most normal people will fight back against that, even under peer pressure.
[00:03:05.721 --> 00:03:06.641]  They will resist it.
[00:03:06.961 --> 00:03:08.842]  And we know they've killed some people that have said no.
[00:03:09.102 --> 00:03:11.382]  People investigating it for the Army.
[00:03:11.502 --> 00:03:14.903]  Army officers that have been murdered, have been suicided.
[00:03:16.003 --> 00:03:25.005]  But a lot of them leave notes behind and say, I kill a lot of innocent people, and what we're doing here is a lie, and it's a fraud, and they blow their heads off.
[00:03:26.076 --> 00:03:27.997]  Now, I'm not saying that's a good thing.
[00:03:28.057 --> 00:03:28.798]  I'm sad for them.
[00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:35.102]  They should come back to America and speak out against the war and ask God to forgive them and forgive themselves.
[00:03:35.863 --> 00:03:37.204]  You can always do that.
[00:03:38.365 --> 00:03:42.547]  It's never too late to turn back if you still have a conscience.
[00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:49.092]  Now, it is too late to turn back if you're somebody like Donald Rumsfeld or Stalin or Mao or Adolf Hitler.
[00:03:49.955 --> 00:03:51.916]  Because you enjoy the evil.
[00:03:51.976 --> 00:03:53.136]  You have hardened your heart.
[00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:55.497]  In fact, in many cases, they're not even hardened.
[00:03:55.537 --> 00:03:57.338]  They're like lakes of lava.
[00:03:57.898 --> 00:03:59.238]  They're not just black and hard.
[00:03:59.258 --> 00:04:04.280]  They're burning with evil and actually enjoying it.
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.342]  There's a level past hardening your heart where you actually revel in it.
[00:04:10.965 --> 00:04:25.872]  But if you still have an inkling, if you still get a tear in your eye, even if you're a neocon out there listening right now, and deep down you know that this is wrong, but you're making excuses to yourself right now and trying to rationalize, it's not too late for you.
[00:04:25.952 --> 00:04:26.813]  But be careful.
[00:04:27.673 --> 00:04:28.814]  You go too long.
[00:04:29.734 --> 00:04:30.855]  You go too long.
[00:04:32.175 --> 00:04:33.796]  And there's no turning back for you.
[00:04:33.816 --> 00:04:38.699]  In fact, some of you are giggling right now, and you're more than just a hard heart.
[00:04:38.739 --> 00:04:39.459]  You're enjoying it.
[00:04:40.314 --> 00:04:48.561]  And, uh, you know, that heat you feel is the lake of fire waiting for you to be thrown into it, literally and figuratively.
[00:04:48.922 --> 00:04:49.742]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:50.063 --> 00:04:54.106]  Just ultra-masses of vital news and information today.

[00:05:02.717 --> 00:05:05.559]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.401]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:12.424]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.765 --> 00:05:19.510]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.812]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:22.012 --> 00:05:24.834]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.954 --> 00:05:29.598]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.818 --> 00:05:34.201]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.462 --> 00:05:41.707]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.948 --> 00:05:44.369]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:01.764 --> 00:06:03.345]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.745 --> 00:06:09.488]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:09.728 --> 00:06:14.851]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:24.476]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.

[00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:12.185]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:07:12.425 --> 00:07:13.927]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:07:13.987 --> 00:07:16.230]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:19.974]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:07:20.294 --> 00:07:22.295]  And they can do it without due process.
[00:07:22.375 --> 00:07:29.297]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries, and now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.

[00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.792]  Tell them you heard it on GCN.
[00:08:02.353 --> 00:08:04.537]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:05.118 --> 00:08:07.922]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:26.548 --> 00:08:28.929]  All right, it is Thursday, 8th day of December 2005.
[00:08:28.969 --> 00:08:32.250]  We're already now well into the second segment in this first hour.
[00:08:32.310 --> 00:08:43.515]  Wide open phones today for first-time callers, and that counts second-time, third-time callers, people who've been unable to get in, who've tried to call in in the past, people who haven't called in at least three or four months.
[00:08:43.535 --> 00:08:44.115]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:44.135 --> 00:08:45.616]  800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[00:08:54.540 --> 00:09:13.116]  I saw a horrible wreck coming into the office just about 30 minutes ago because a lot of times I get ready at my home office and come into the studio and I'm going to talk about this first and then I'm going to get into I am sullied suicide before dishonor in occupied Iraq
[00:09:14.003 --> 00:09:15.983]  High level officers committing suicide.
[00:09:16.083 --> 00:09:17.284]  Record levels of it.
[00:09:17.844 --> 00:09:22.604]  Because a normal person cannot just see the raping and killing of children.
[00:09:22.645 --> 00:09:24.665]  He'd actually written home about that to family.
[00:09:25.505 --> 00:09:26.765]  The torture, the rest of it.
[00:09:27.365 --> 00:09:31.726]  And not either get out of it or commit suicide or have a nervous breakdown.
[00:09:32.086 --> 00:09:33.946]  Now sickos do enjoy it.
[00:09:34.647 --> 00:09:35.907]  And that's why they're going to hell.
[00:09:35.967 --> 00:09:37.627]  So that's coming up a little bit later.
[00:09:39.107 --> 00:09:43.008]  Also we're now learning more about this man in Miami.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:10:01.266]  Uh, who, uh, the wife was screaming, he's off his medication, he's bipolar, he was basically running around, sweating and freaking out on the plane, and the air marshals heard that, chased him, and it's now beginning to emerge that it looks like he said, I don't have a bomb, leave me alone.
[00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:04.067]  And just the word bomb, they gunned him down.
[00:10:04.747 --> 00:10:08.068]  And in this hyped up, out of control, fear mongering society,
[00:10:09.299 --> 00:10:17.747]  I'm not really going to sit here and at this point go after the Air Marshals, because they've been trained to kill somebody that talks about having a bomb.
[00:10:19.788 --> 00:10:26.194]  Now, in the case of the young Brazilian man, these guys look like they could be brothers.
[00:10:26.735 --> 00:10:31.379]  This guy looks like he just maybe weighs 20 pounds more, but this could be his older brother.
[00:10:32.299 --> 00:10:33.861]  This guy that was killed in Miami.
[00:10:35.146 --> 00:10:39.772]  But we had the case, you know, after the 7-7 bombings over in London of this electrician.
[00:10:40.172 --> 00:10:41.894]  No criminal record, done nothing wrong.
[00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:45.339]  They said he ran from them and had a bomb and a big jacket and wires.
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:47.581]  Then it turned out, okay, no bomb.
[00:10:47.601 --> 00:10:49.724]  Then it turned out, well, it wasn't really a jacket.
[00:10:49.744 --> 00:10:52.047]  It was just a button-up over shirt.
[00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:58.462]  And then it turned out, you know, a denim shirt, which I own a couple of, kind of western style really.
[00:10:59.183 --> 00:11:03.986]  And then it turned out he didn't run, it turned out he just sat down and they walked up to him and shot him.
[00:11:04.046 --> 00:11:09.769]  First it was five times, then seven times, then ten times, then twelve times, last report was fourteen times.
[00:11:10.549 --> 00:11:14.132]  And the government lied about it, and that clearly was some type of black op execution.
[00:11:14.652 --> 00:11:18.074]  Looks like this boy might have known a little too much, might have been doing some work for him.
[00:11:18.969 --> 00:11:20.992]  And just had to get rid of him.
[00:11:21.312 --> 00:11:22.834]  That was an outright execution.
[00:11:22.854 --> 00:11:31.646]  Because they tend to use Latin Americans as operatives to double and play the part of Arabs at the scenes of terror events.
[00:11:33.075 --> 00:11:34.936]  There's been massive recruiting by the U.S.
[00:11:34.976 --> 00:11:48.383]  and England and others in Latin America, really over the last 75 years, and they've got a lot of operatives and a lot of military training at Fort Benning, Georgia, School of the Americas and other areas, and this guy fit the military M.O.
[00:11:48.963 --> 00:11:50.183]  That is with the London shooting.
[00:11:50.504 --> 00:11:53.345]  The other fellow here that fits the M.O.
[00:11:53.365 --> 00:11:57.807]  had mental problems, been hopped up on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[00:11:58.968 --> 00:12:01.629]  Every mass shooter we've seen, Harris, Kleibold, Kinkel,
[00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.612]  The kid up on the reservation up in Minnesota.
[00:12:06.212 --> 00:12:14.157]  I mean, we have not seen a case ever, and there have even been big articles about that in the mainstream press, where they weren't hopped up on one or more of these.
[00:12:15.738 --> 00:12:19.080]  And he was hopped up on these, and it's when you go off the medication.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:25.543]  I mean, you have a higher increase of suicide, crazy behavior, psychotic breaks, delusional behavior.
[00:12:25.563 --> 00:12:27.684]  I mean, that's in the insert with the drugs, folks.
[00:12:27.704 --> 00:12:30.286]  That's what the actual warnings say that come with the pills.
[00:12:32.546 --> 00:12:34.747]  That you can request if you're on them and read it for yourself.
[00:12:35.027 --> 00:12:37.389]  But when you go off of them, that skyrockets.
[00:12:37.849 --> 00:12:42.971]  I mean, if you suddenly go off those, never go off a serotonin reuptake inhibitor instantly.
[00:12:43.251 --> 00:12:49.214]  You have to go off of it slowly, like you would heroin or methamphetamine that you've been on for years.
[00:12:50.995 --> 00:12:56.457]  Because the molecules are even more complex, even more dangerous, and affect even more of those key chemicals in the brain.
[00:12:56.477 --> 00:12:58.978]  But again, I said I'd get to all this later.
[00:12:59.239 --> 00:12:59.959]  The point is,
[00:13:00.888 --> 00:13:03.049]  That they've killed a mental patient, basically.
[00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:18.759]  And Miami was fear-mongering and saying all over the city they were going to be checking IDs and they were going to be searching everyone and they were going to be randomly surrounding malls and searching everyone and riot gear and handing out flyers, scaring everybody.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:25.863]  And so you've got this added fear going and it turns out at the very airport there was a shoe bomber threat.
[00:13:26.223 --> 00:13:28.725]  Why an Arab man's shoe tested positive.
[00:13:30.084 --> 00:13:53.232]  I've been in the airport line when people's stuff, people who are involved in construction, who walk in certain chemicals or paints, people who are in farming and might walk around in ammonium nitrate, or let's say you had some Miracle-Gro out in your yard and you were doing it on the tomatoes and you wore those tennis shoes, you got Miracle-Gro on, it's going to go off.
[00:13:53.312 --> 00:13:54.812]  There are hundreds of things.
[00:13:55.253 --> 00:13:56.313]  I've seen people.
[00:13:57.475 --> 00:14:00.397]  I've seen people in the line when I met, I think, where was it?
[00:14:00.417 --> 00:14:10.063]  It was Chicago one time and they got a positive and some guards came over and they checked him and obviously it was a false alarm or you would have heard about it on the news.
[00:14:10.884 --> 00:14:11.944]  Just some old white guy.
[00:14:12.705 --> 00:14:26.694]  But, oh, at Miami, they'd had an alert, they'd picked up possible explosives, turned out it was a false alarm, but that didn't matter and then, oops, you get somebody who runs off the plane foaming at the mouth and so you gun them down.
[00:14:28.169 --> 00:14:34.512]  And frankly, in this false, fear-mongering, uh... I mean, I don't think you can fault individual officers if their story's true.
[00:14:34.532 --> 00:14:36.173]  You know, usually they lie.
[00:14:36.253 --> 00:14:37.233]  Most of the time it's a lie.
[00:14:37.253 --> 00:14:39.735]  I mean, I'm saying it could be true this time.
[00:14:40.315 --> 00:14:41.996]  Statistically, though, it is probably a lie.
[00:14:42.836 --> 00:14:48.019]  And from what I've seen in the past, past experience, I mean, because they don't really have witnesses of him saying, bomb now.
[00:14:48.039 --> 00:14:53.101]  It was like out on the... when he'd run out of the plane and he was saying this about, uh, bomb.
[00:14:53.821 --> 00:14:57.303]  When nobody's around and they're shooting him in the back, oh, they heard something about a bomb.
[00:14:58.203 --> 00:15:04.765]  I got a sneaking suspicion that isn't the case and these boys just got jumpy like it was a rabbit or a pheasant about to get away from them.
[00:15:05.205 --> 00:15:08.005]  And boy, that clay pigeon went up and they took it out.
[00:15:08.545 --> 00:15:14.267]  And they probably had a couple drinks last night after their debriefing and, hey, you popped your cherry officer, Billy Bob.
[00:15:14.727 --> 00:15:16.187]  Yeah, I'm a real man now.
[00:15:16.227 --> 00:15:17.328]  I got me a loony.
[00:15:19.388 --> 00:15:21.168]  And I'm not making fun of this gentleman.
[00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:23.229]  I'm trying to guess what was said or done.
[00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:26.490]  Or maybe the guys are crying in their wives' arms tonight.
[00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:27.690]  You know, I don't know.
[00:15:28.619 --> 00:15:30.420]  But it's just so ridiculous.
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:34.003]  These air marshals when you're on planes are so obvious.
[00:15:34.763 --> 00:15:36.264]  Okay, now I've spent five minutes on this.
[00:15:37.905 --> 00:15:38.706]  We'll get into that.
[00:15:38.986 --> 00:15:43.629]  And there's been other cases of air marshals putting guns to people's heads just for arguing with the stewardess.
[00:15:44.610 --> 00:15:45.531]  See, I'm politically correct.
[00:15:45.951 --> 00:15:46.771]  The stewardess.
[00:15:47.072 --> 00:15:49.733]  I'm going to call it Christmas.
[00:15:50.654 --> 00:15:51.575]  I do things like that.
[00:15:52.015 --> 00:15:52.615]  Exclusive.
[00:15:52.675 --> 00:15:53.636]  Shoe bomber alert.
[00:15:53.676 --> 00:15:54.897]  Preceded airport shooting.
[00:15:55.774 --> 00:15:57.215]  And then we have some interesting news here.
[00:15:57.275 --> 00:15:59.777]  Economy lifts Bush support in latest poll.
[00:16:00.718 --> 00:16:08.803]  And even in the staged polls, he's at 35% with his newest staged polls at 40%, but all the other polls are showing 30 to 28%.
[00:16:11.205 --> 00:16:24.234]  And something really interesting, Village Voice of all places, who's been busy in the past poo-pooing government involvement in 9-11, four years later we still have ten big questions open and shut is the headline.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.141]  And it's by Jarrett Murphy, and he brings up, what blew up Building 7?
[00:16:29.301 --> 00:16:32.762]  And ten other questions, and I've got to make myself cover this today.
[00:16:33.402 --> 00:16:39.863]  Also, military will request $100 billion for Iraq next year, Martha reveals, continuing.
[00:16:40.483 --> 00:16:48.665]  And actually, there's 163,000 troops there, up from 140,000 just a year ago, so they're actually increasing the troop levels.
[00:16:48.685 --> 00:16:49.925]  Things are going so badly there.
[00:16:51.717 --> 00:16:53.538]  NATO agrees to expand Afghan role.
[00:16:54.018 --> 00:16:57.159]  They're basically going to be the main force in Afghanistan taking over.
[00:16:57.579 --> 00:17:01.660]  As they will later in Iraq after we've been properly demonized.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.600]  All part of the plan.
[00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.300]  All part of the globalist plan.
[00:17:04.921 --> 00:17:07.041]  There's this latest Bin Laden live tape.
[00:17:07.061 --> 00:17:08.342]  He's going to kill us and he's going to get us.
[00:17:09.222 --> 00:17:13.863]  And the major universities and other media watchdog groups compared it and said no it's the same thing as two years ago.
[00:17:14.323 --> 00:17:21.105]  You've knowingly taken a video from four and a half years ago and you've re-edited it again claiming it's new.
[00:17:23.456 --> 00:17:26.598]  Bin Laden, a live claim, is from Old Video, London Guardian.
[00:17:26.879 --> 00:17:28.960]  And we have another flashback to the last time they did this.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:29.921]  This was December 7th.
[00:17:30.261 --> 00:17:32.042]  We have another flashback to several years ago.
[00:17:32.483 --> 00:17:37.226]  Bin Laden video is a compilation of repeats, says expert.
[00:17:38.247 --> 00:17:40.389]  We'll get into that.
[00:17:40.829 --> 00:17:49.916]  And something interesting, a Wikipedia encyclopedia that I find to be quite interesting and entertaining and sometimes more informative than the Britannica.
[00:17:50.732 --> 00:17:53.553]  Or the World Encyclopedia or the World Book.
[00:17:54.314 --> 00:17:55.294]  I like Wikipedia.
[00:17:55.374 --> 00:18:02.817]  I think that we should all be able to post and I think we should all have alternative websites, alternative historical review sites.
[00:18:03.738 --> 00:18:10.761]  And I didn't complain when Wikipedia allowed a horde, a literal horde of liars
[00:18:11.989 --> 00:18:30.617]  To go on there a few months ago and say, the neutrality of the Wikipedia encyclopedia information on Alex Jones, the validity of it, is being questioned, or the neutrality.
[00:18:31.178 --> 00:18:36.200]  And of course I would say it was very neutral, what was being said about me.
[00:18:36.994 --> 00:18:51.082]  In fact, Wikipedia had some good stuff, some negative stuff, but it was really professional, going off what I've done, the films I've made, where I've been interviewed, what I'm best known for, links to every claim they made, really informative.
[00:18:51.242 --> 00:18:58.506]  And I find, on average, a lot of times Wikipedia is more accurate and more detailed than Britannica.
[00:18:59.915 --> 00:19:07.419]  And several other encyclopedias, and I spend probably an hour a day, oh that's not true, thirty minutes a day looking at stuff on an encyclopedia.
[00:19:07.439 --> 00:19:11.261]  Some days it might be three hours, but I'd say on average about thirty minutes a day.
[00:19:11.281 --> 00:19:16.764]  So I'm quite a hand at encyclopedias, and I've found Wikipedia to be really good.
[00:19:17.004 --> 00:19:17.785]  It's open source.
[00:19:19.005 --> 00:19:27.690]  They've got thousands of monitors and people that double check what you're saying, and then look at what you're saying, and if it's found to be patently false, and no basis in reality, they will remove it.
[00:19:28.962 --> 00:19:34.425]  And then they let other people challenge, but this latest thing against me was just really, really sloppy and mean.
[00:19:34.445 --> 00:19:40.148]  And I noticed about a couple weeks ago, I went to Wikipedia, and I thought, well, I'll look at what they say about me today.
[00:19:40.968 --> 00:19:42.609]  And it was gone.
[00:19:42.809 --> 00:19:44.350]  All that mean stuff about me was gone.
[00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:52.914]  And I guess it's because some of those same people, disinfo artists, without even saying who they were, were lying about other people.
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.422]  And so Wikipedia has now, uh, you just have to register who you are.
[00:19:57.442 --> 00:19:58.523]  And I think that's fair.
[00:19:58.563 --> 00:20:00.884]  If you're going to say stuff about people, say who you are!
[00:20:03.846 --> 00:20:10.470]  Do you desire to increase your energy levels and relieve your pain and stress without chemicals, drugs, or expensive supplements?

[00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:22.269]  The Berkey Light's self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:21:22.489 --> 00:21:25.151]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:25.471 --> 00:21:29.595]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled
[00:21:29.775 --> 00:21:31.918]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:21:32.078 --> 00:21:33.960]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:40.187]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:21:40.427 --> 00:21:46.094]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.

[00:22:03.348 --> 00:22:05.569]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[00:22:05.989 --> 00:22:10.351]  Lately, I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[00:22:10.631 --> 00:22:16.434]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[00:22:16.674 --> 00:22:20.715]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[00:22:20.996 --> 00:22:26.638]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over a moderate time span.
[00:22:26.758 --> 00:22:29.379]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:35.002]  By mid 1983, it was close to $500 amounts.
[00:22:35.122 --> 00:22:37.804]  In 1986, gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[00:22:38.144 --> 00:22:40.446]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[00:22:40.826 --> 00:22:44.449]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[00:22:44.929 --> 00:22:51.133]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[00:22:51.573 --> 00:22:52.554]  You'll be glad you did.
[00:22:52.574 --> 00:22:53.234]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:53.294 --> 00:22:53.515]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.964 --> 00:23:04.565]  E equals MC squared is wrong.
[00:23:05.045 --> 00:23:05.886]  What are you talking about?
[00:23:06.146 --> 00:23:07.627]  Einstein's equations have errors.
[00:23:07.747 --> 00:23:10.428]  It's in this book I've been reading, The Collapse of Special Relativity.
[00:23:10.548 --> 00:23:11.669]  That can't be right.
[00:23:11.829 --> 00:23:12.710]  Where did you hear about that?
[00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.312]  In Requiem for Relativity, The Collapse of Special Relativity.
[00:23:16.592 --> 00:23:20.014]  A book at RelativityCollapse.net and RelativityCollapse.com.
[00:23:20.234 --> 00:23:22.655]  I liked what they had to say so I bought it at Amazon.com.
[00:23:23.195 --> 00:23:24.016]  I don't know.
[00:23:24.076 --> 00:23:25.777]  It sounds like it'd be complicated to read.
[00:23:26.117 --> 00:23:26.957]  That's where you're wrong.
[00:23:27.278 --> 00:23:27.798]  It's written with a
[00:23:29.286 --> 00:23:32.588]  Just enough to get the point across and also has many detailed drawings.
[00:23:32.868 --> 00:23:33.448]  Are you sure?
[00:23:33.468 --> 00:23:35.569]  I mean, E equals MC squared.
[00:23:36.109 --> 00:23:36.930]  That's gotta be wrong.
[00:23:37.210 --> 00:23:37.550]  It is.
[00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:38.950]  That's not what I meant.
[00:23:39.291 --> 00:23:40.051]  Where'd you find that book?
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:48.662]  Requiem for Relativity, The Collapse of Special Relativity at RelativityCollapse.com, RelativityCollapse.net, or Amazon.com.
[00:23:48.943 --> 00:23:50.563]  I still can't believe that Einstein is wrong.
[00:23:50.863 --> 00:23:52.103]  It's the 21st century.
[00:23:52.143 --> 00:23:52.864]  Get up to speed.
[00:23:53.264 --> 00:24:00.226]  Just buy The Collapse of Special Relativity at RelativityCollapse.com, or RelativityCollapse.net, or Amazon.com today.
[00:24:06.052 --> 00:24:07.153]  The show is documented.
[00:24:07.653 --> 00:24:10.456]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:10.856 --> 00:24:14.359]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[00:24:14.779 --> 00:24:21.265]  I went down, down, down, and across the coal mine to go for the space.
[00:24:22.306 --> 00:24:31.574]  They watched us, like a scientist might watch microscopic organisms through a microscope in a petri dish.
[00:24:32.868 --> 00:24:36.029]  Quietly, over millennia, they laid their plans.
[00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:39.290]  That's a paraphrase from H.G.
[00:24:39.330 --> 00:24:40.371]  Wells' War of the Worlds.
[00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:57.276]  And then, of course, on Halloween night, many years after he'd written it, Orson Welles got on the radio and said Martians were attacking and there were mass panics and freak-outs and wrecks everywhere and a lot of deaths just from the ensuing freak-out.
[00:24:57.296 --> 00:25:02.218]  And imagine what the globalists could do with a real 9-11 attack that they themselves carried out
[00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:15.973]  With little puppet Arabs taking the fall because they're CIA operatives, and then herding and stampeding us into submission for all these fake wars and the butchering of the Bill of Rights and the Constitution.
[00:25:15.993 --> 00:25:25.675]  And I saw another local example, or I guess microscopic example, compared to the entire world, here in Austin, Texas.
[00:25:25.795 --> 00:25:27.255]  Now, up in Dallas growing up,
[00:25:28.001 --> 00:25:34.046]  It gets a lot colder 200 miles north of here in Dallas, and it snows almost every year, even with the warming trend we've seen.
[00:25:34.567 --> 00:25:38.270]  And people can drive pretty good on ice and snow, and it isn't too bad.
[00:25:38.690 --> 00:25:45.116]  And you go up north, people can drive really good on it, because they drive on it about four or five months, sometimes more, out of the year.
[00:25:45.136 --> 00:25:46.237]  They're really skilled.
[00:25:48.959 --> 00:25:53.643]  But every time there's any frost or any snow here in Austin, there is psychopathic behavior.
[00:25:54.083 --> 00:25:54.944]  That's not the right word.
[00:25:55.064 --> 00:25:55.605]  Panicked.
[00:25:56.221 --> 00:25:56.962]  We're good to go.
[00:26:16.929 --> 00:26:20.152]  Because they could stampede them off of a cliff.
[00:26:20.172 --> 00:26:27.459]  These big animals that were so powerful and so formative that big cats in Africa couldn't even bring down.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.566]  Man was able to kill because they were able to stampede them, basically by beating on their shields, making a bunch of noise.
[00:26:35.986 --> 00:26:36.927]  Not being afraid.
[00:26:36.967 --> 00:26:39.248]  You know, they learned that trick of not being afraid.
[00:26:39.288 --> 00:26:41.529]  You charge an elephant, on average it will run.
[00:26:41.869 --> 00:26:44.910]  A lion will run, but it's almost like you telegraph a message.
[00:26:44.930 --> 00:26:47.791]  You really, you have to believe you're going to destroy the lion.
[00:26:47.811 --> 00:26:49.712]  You have to believe you have the power to do it.
[00:26:50.232 --> 00:26:50.893]  It will run.
[00:26:52.413 --> 00:26:53.354]  Because it's convinced.
[00:26:53.394 --> 00:27:01.037]  If you actually have doubt, you'll put off a smell, and I believe even almost like a wavelength, because they've admitted the brain's electrochemical and does broadcast.
[00:27:01.957 --> 00:27:04.838]  They just haven't proven that it broadcasts from mammal to mammal.
[00:27:05.598 --> 00:27:07.879]  I mean, I'm just talking about science here, and they will run.
[00:27:07.899 --> 00:27:18.003]  Okay, now I've really gone down the Primrose Path here, but the point is, that I'm trying to make, is that there was stampeding, freaking out, insanity.
[00:27:18.063 --> 00:27:24.166]  Last night, it was about 32 degrees when I got off the TV show at 9 o'clock, left at 9.30.
[00:27:25.459 --> 00:27:28.720]  The ground temperature was 50-60 degrees.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:35.023]  It takes days for the ground to get cold enough when it's just been 80 degrees three days ago.
[00:27:35.043 --> 00:27:39.144]  It takes days to get it down cold enough where it'll stick.
[00:27:39.745 --> 00:27:45.887]  Only on overpasses and places like that where it's above ground where it would still take a few hours for those to freeze.
[00:27:46.207 --> 00:27:53.930]  The overpasses hadn't even frozen yet and they already had sand and salt poured all over them.
[00:27:54.944 --> 00:27:55.444]  Didn't matter.
[00:27:55.764 --> 00:27:56.745]  Cars were swerving.
[00:27:56.765 --> 00:27:58.046]  People were driving insanely.
[00:27:58.086 --> 00:28:01.227]  People were pulled over with their lights on their cell phones, freaked out.
[00:28:01.527 --> 00:28:03.548]  I'm talking about just on little side streets.
[00:28:04.129 --> 00:28:06.130]  I was over on, what, East 7th.
[00:28:06.850 --> 00:28:12.153]  About half the cars had their hazards on, driving five miles an hour.
[00:28:12.593 --> 00:28:22.118]  Meanwhile, other cars were driving around insanely, over the speed limit, and there I was, driving a little bit slower than normal, and I'm not the best driver, folks, but just paying attention.
[00:28:24.384 --> 00:28:28.809]  And there were, I don't know, they said as of this morning, 60-something wrecks.
[00:28:28.829 --> 00:28:32.232]  Well, I saw one coming into the office today.
[00:28:33.853 --> 00:28:35.155]  The overpasses had thawed.
[00:28:35.895 --> 00:28:36.716]  There was no ice.
[00:28:37.637 --> 00:28:40.500]  There were piles of sand and grooves and it was wet.
[00:28:42.668 --> 00:28:54.091]  And I was driving up over 290, coming down to take the Lamar exit down over the overpass, and cars had slowed down to drive five miles an hour over the water.
[00:28:55.431 --> 00:28:56.271]  The water scared them.
[00:28:56.671 --> 00:28:56.991]  Fine.
[00:28:57.992 --> 00:29:07.974]  And I'd slowed down, and I thought, man, this is dangerous, because that's one thing I'm good at, it's like seeing pieces of things together as a picture very quickly.
[00:29:08.846 --> 00:29:09.927]  I'm not good at a lot of other things.
[00:29:09.967 --> 00:29:11.948]  I might toot my horn here, but I thought this is really dangerous.
[00:29:12.609 --> 00:29:15.971]  I bet somebody's going to smash into these cars as we go over this next hill.
[00:29:16.371 --> 00:29:17.392]  I bet a hot dog.
[00:29:17.412 --> 00:29:19.433]  That guy was on the phone with Mike Hanson.
[00:29:19.473 --> 00:29:20.234]  I said, I gotta go.
[00:29:20.294 --> 00:29:21.054]  I'm in a traffic jam.
[00:29:21.074 --> 00:29:21.615]  It's dangerous.
[00:29:22.295 --> 00:29:23.196]  I hung up on him.
[00:29:23.636 --> 00:29:28.039]  And there's about five cars behind me and about ten in front of me.
[00:29:28.579 --> 00:29:32.362]  And this hot dog comes over the hill and just plows.
[00:29:33.189 --> 00:29:37.170]  into the back of this truck and turns and bashes into another one.
[00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:46.973]  And actually it was the fear, it was the quaking, the shaking of whoever was afraid of water on an exit ramp that caused this.
[00:29:47.893 --> 00:29:49.613]  It's just like War of the Worlds, folks.
[00:29:52.114 --> 00:29:53.034]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.515 --> 00:29:55.115]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:56.035 --> 00:29:58.696]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.112 --> 00:30:04.714]  Government is best what governs me.
[00:30:05.255 --> 00:30:06.577]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:07.017 --> 00:30:09.721]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:10.162 --> 00:30:12.825]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:13.266 --> 00:30:19.695]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:30:43.093 --> 00:30:44.595]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:31:54.648 --> 00:32:04.996]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:32:05.516 --> 00:32:10.360]  Did you know that the Bible forecasts signs to let us know that we're in the last days?
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:17.126]  The book of Revelation says that world travel, quickly and efficiently, would be one sign, and also knowledge would increase.
[00:32:17.466 --> 00:32:17.926]  I think so.
[00:32:33.097 --> 00:32:33.317]  516-8736.

[00:33:33.038 --> 00:33:39.300]  I really want callers who haven't called in a while or first-time callers are really great.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:39.520]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:48.463]  And again, I don't do this a lot, but lately I've been doing it a few days a week because I want people who can never get through it a good chance to
[00:33:48.963 --> 00:33:54.287]  Get involved on there and I get a lot of emails when people finally get through the lob and run for a year to get in every time I call.
[00:33:54.307 --> 00:33:54.827]  It's busy.
[00:33:55.247 --> 00:33:56.848]  Well, here's your chance 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:58.389 --> 00:34:04.393]  Not that I don't love our regular callers and callers who call once a month or once every two weeks.
[00:34:04.413 --> 00:34:07.635]  It's just that you all make great points and we love you.
[00:34:07.696 --> 00:34:12.839]  It's just that other people need a chance to get involved occasionally and we don't screen calls per se.
[00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:14.020]  We ask where you're calling from.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.020]  We're good to go.
[00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:58.937]  And I'll say, hey, we've got Mrs. Shoemaker on who discovered Levy Shoemaker 9 that hit Saturn and we really want to talk about near-Earth objects and the asteroid belt and what danger we are being hit by one of these asteroids and what danger it would cause.
[00:34:59.017 --> 00:35:00.838]  And people called in talking about
[00:35:01.849 --> 00:35:03.230]  Talking about the Second Amendment.
[00:35:03.350 --> 00:35:08.635]  You know, it's just kind of... I even criticize those sometimes when I have a guest on.
[00:35:08.675 --> 00:35:09.976]  I go, I'd like to talk about this issue.
[00:35:10.636 --> 00:35:14.520]  People, how dare you try to control the flow of the debate?
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:18.143]  Folks, you know, you can't please everybody all the time.
[00:35:18.283 --> 00:35:21.325]  In fact, you can't really please anybody completely.
[00:35:21.345 --> 00:35:25.289]  I mean, what do the Rolling Stones say?
[00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:26.730]  I can't get no satisfaction.
[00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:27.971]  I actually, though, have found
[00:35:28.735 --> 00:35:31.196]  Satisfaction, and that is in fighting the New World Order.
[00:35:31.216 --> 00:35:32.916]  Alright, I really am babbling now.
[00:35:33.737 --> 00:35:42.299]  Finishing up the point I was making, and then we're going to go to someone who's waiting in the wings and then to your calls, is just this.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.840]  I watched panic.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.101]  I watched hysteria.
[00:35:47.221 --> 00:35:48.341]  I watched insanity.
[00:35:48.841 --> 00:35:55.303]  Every time, folks, it rains here sometimes, and people drive around in psychopathic fashion, running into everyone.
[00:35:56.143 --> 00:35:57.644]  It's just total hysteria.
[00:36:00.804 --> 00:36:04.806]  There was no ice here in the main city just a few hours ago.
[00:36:05.766 --> 00:36:06.987]  There's no ice on the road.
[00:36:07.827 --> 00:36:14.430]  There might be a little bitty icicle in the corner under the eave of the house where no sunlight has hit it.
[00:36:15.150 --> 00:36:15.891]  And it doesn't matter.
[00:36:16.011 --> 00:36:22.174]  People were running into each other because they were so afraid of the wet road that they actually
[00:36:23.346 --> 00:36:49.396]  I said five miles an hour, try actually two miles an hour, and they went over this hill, and then they were all, the cars are all stopped there, were going two miles an hour, and then somebody doesn't know that, and they just come flying over the hill, and I'm actually there watching my rearview mirror saying it's going to happen any second, and I don't normally drive around in fear of something, you know, smashing in, I just had this feeling, and boom, I watched it happen.
[00:36:51.451 --> 00:37:03.617]  So you have that combination of people panicking, running over the edge of the cliff, and then somebody who's totally lackadaisical, not worried about it, because they know that the ice is thawed, but they weren't thinking, wait a minute.
[00:37:04.238 --> 00:37:11.721]  In fact, this morning I told some of my folks that work in the office here, some of my comrades, I said, just don't come in.
[00:37:11.741 --> 00:37:13.242]  And they're like, well, the ice is melted.
[00:37:13.322 --> 00:37:13.982]  It's not dangerous.
[00:37:14.002 --> 00:37:16.424]  And I said, listen, the people are dangerous.
[00:37:17.504 --> 00:37:18.765]  They're totally afraid.
[00:37:20.997 --> 00:37:22.358]  They're stricken with fear.
[00:37:22.538 --> 00:37:24.119]  All the schools are closed today.
[00:37:24.719 --> 00:37:28.621]  All the government buildings are closed today in Austin, Texas, and there's no ice!
[00:37:29.581 --> 00:37:30.501]  There's no ice!
[00:37:31.482 --> 00:37:37.805]  Now, you get out in the hill country, a couple thousand foot elevation, where it did pour rain last night, and there is still some ice.
[00:37:38.585 --> 00:37:43.287]  And there's still some ice on some bridges, but I don't know, it just is insanity.
[00:37:44.415 --> 00:37:53.719]  And I imagine what it's like for northerners who see real ice and snow to just... I always talk to northerners who live down here, and they're even more amazed.
[00:37:53.739 --> 00:38:02.002]  Because I'm from Dallas, again, where we get some snow and some sleet every year, usually multiple times, sometimes for weeks on end.
[00:38:02.763 --> 00:38:05.864]  When I was a kid growing up in Dallas, we had months where there was snow.
[00:38:06.164 --> 00:38:12.667]  Not anymore, but we still grew up with some snow driving, some ice driving, and there were still people there who
[00:38:14.164 --> 00:38:24.309]  I've spent too long on this, but I'm sure you've experienced it, but just as a way of looking at it, it just shows how the people are afraid of everything.
[00:38:24.849 --> 00:38:40.477]  Americans were once the most reliant, the most informed, the strongest, the smartest, the most educated people in the world, and now, I guarantee you all these people out there having wrecks and running into everyone right now, and I've had wrecks too, I'm not saying I'm Mario Andretti,
[00:38:41.428 --> 00:38:46.395]  I guarantee you they're experts on downloading their favorite videos to watch on their video pod.
[00:38:46.976 --> 00:38:49.038]  I guarantee you they're experts on how to act cool.
[00:38:49.078 --> 00:38:56.108]  They're experts on everything but how to not be afraid of the non-existent ice, but afraid of themselves.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:58.940]  There, I've said it.
[00:38:59.100 --> 00:38:59.380]  Okay.
[00:39:00.021 --> 00:39:05.282]  Debbie Morrow hasn't been on with us yet this week and I'm always honored to have her up in Dallas.
[00:39:06.342 --> 00:39:11.224]  Debbie, how are you braving the new ice age we're facing here?
[00:39:11.864 --> 00:39:21.087]  I was just laughing at you when you were saying that because my son didn't go to work today because of the ice.
[00:39:21.127 --> 00:39:23.327]  Because he drives, you know, kind of far.
[00:39:23.787 --> 00:39:25.348]  But I just looked out the door
[00:39:26.021 --> 00:39:26.943]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:39:36.693 --> 00:39:39.634]  And I went in his room and said, you know, you really could go to work today.
[00:39:40.954 --> 00:39:43.175]  It's not so bad as it appears.
[00:39:43.195 --> 00:39:44.835]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:39:44.936 --> 00:39:48.937]  The grass doesn't retain any heat like the ground.
[00:39:48.997 --> 00:39:49.817]  Right, exactly.
[00:39:49.877 --> 00:39:52.358]  And so it goes below 32 very quickly.
[00:39:52.418 --> 00:39:56.799]  And then, yes, you've got some... I mean, I'm watching wrecks everywhere and there's no ice.
[00:39:57.139 --> 00:40:01.541]  Yeah, and it's real funny because it was 84 two days ago.
[00:40:01.561 --> 00:40:03.701]  So you know the ground is still warm.
[00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:04.962]  Well, here's the thing, Debbie.
[00:40:07.193 --> 00:40:10.016]  I was seeing the statistics just a few days ago, reading them.
[00:40:10.136 --> 00:40:17.523]  Over 100,000 people have gotten deathly ill and gotten hepatitis just in the last five years in the U.S.
[00:40:18.444 --> 00:40:27.273]  from the lettuce from Mexico that's sprayed with human feces, totally disease ridden with parasites, you name it.
[00:40:27.653 --> 00:40:28.634]  People aren't afraid of that.
[00:40:29.034 --> 00:40:31.076]  Because the media didn't tell them to be afraid of it.
[00:40:31.516 --> 00:40:41.386]  They're not afraid of hepatitis, and they're not afraid of drug immune TB, people dying every day in Austin from it, because the media didn't tell them to be afraid.
[00:40:41.666 --> 00:40:53.397]  No, they are so afraid that they got the jitters so bad, they're driving around on dry roads with blinkers, hazards on, running into each other, just shaking like they're being attacked by Al Qaeda.
[00:40:53.877 --> 00:40:54.417]  I know.
[00:40:54.437 --> 00:40:55.658]  That's the point I'm trying to make.
[00:40:56.118 --> 00:40:56.619]  I know.
[00:40:56.639 --> 00:40:59.160]  But I'm afraid of the stuff that really I should be afraid of.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:01.442]  Because, see, I know the government's a bunch of liars.
[00:41:01.482 --> 00:41:01.862]  I'm sorry.
[00:41:03.985 --> 00:41:04.606]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[00:41:04.686 --> 00:41:05.947]  I'm out of control.
[00:41:06.467 --> 00:41:14.594]  Debbie, tell us about the Made in America British Berkey, American Berkeys, just all the quality products you've got.
[00:41:14.614 --> 00:41:17.937]  And it's the holidays, and folks, this is real.
[00:41:18.197 --> 00:41:19.438]  The water is full of poison.
[00:41:19.478 --> 00:41:20.719]  You want to be afraid of something?
[00:41:21.019 --> 00:41:21.860]  Be afraid of this.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:22.801]  I'm afraid of it.
[00:41:23.061 --> 00:41:23.381]  Stop.
[00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:24.763]  I will not drink tap water.
[00:41:25.243 --> 00:41:25.703]  That's right.
[00:41:26.144 --> 00:41:27.525]  Stop drinking your tap water.
[00:41:28.191 --> 00:41:30.073]  Don't poison yourself every day.
[00:41:30.093 --> 00:41:51.712]  In fact I got an email yesterday and it was kind of one of those little comical ones and this lady is sitting next to her husband and he's laying in bed all sick and he's saying well I have this confession honey and she's going it's okay it's okay and it goes on it shows all the pictures and he's confessing all these terrible things he's done throughout their marriage you know
[00:41:52.225 --> 00:41:59.210]  And she's just sitting there and he's got his little cup of tea and at the end it says, okay, honey, now you just keep drinking that poison.
[00:42:00.591 --> 00:42:07.595]  And I thought about the water, how we're poisoning ourselves every day, you know, and we need to stop doing that.
[00:42:07.695 --> 00:42:14.940]  We need to, you know, take control of our environment and our life and don't buy a Berkey and put it in your closet.
[00:42:15.450 --> 00:42:21.614]  And save it for an emergency because you're in an emergency every day when it comes to your drinking water.
[00:42:21.654 --> 00:42:23.235]  Debbie, I want people to know something.
[00:42:23.376 --> 00:42:31.681]  You know, I could be endorsing a thousand magic products that heal all your ails and the snake oil bonanza.
[00:42:31.761 --> 00:42:32.262]  I don't do it.
[00:42:32.862 --> 00:42:34.103]  I only promote real things.
[00:42:34.143 --> 00:42:35.044]  And folks, let me tell you something.
[00:42:35.084 --> 00:42:36.265]  Go to the EPA's website.
[00:42:36.665 --> 00:42:38.806]  Look at what is allowable in the water.
[00:42:38.926 --> 00:42:39.507]  Taste it.
[00:42:40.107 --> 00:42:42.109]  I mean, how do you feed this to your children?
[00:42:42.149 --> 00:42:43.230]  How do you drink this?
[00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:50.435]  So many of the chronic fatigue and these diseases, so many of these problems are linked to the water.
[00:42:50.475 --> 00:42:52.537]  It's 70 plus percent of your body.
[00:42:53.158 --> 00:42:56.180]  Debbie, give folks some of the specials and tell them how they call and get it.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:05.467]  Jim and I were talking about that because the special that we've been doing, and it's still available, is four Berkey lights without lights.
[00:43:06.108 --> 00:43:08.930]  And you get seven Berkey sport bottles with it.
[00:43:09.454 --> 00:43:14.417]  But we thought, you know, there's some people, a lot of people out there can't afford to buy four.
[00:43:14.997 --> 00:43:17.838]  So we've decided to... Alex Jones can't.
[00:43:17.918 --> 00:43:18.639]  Right, me neither.
[00:43:19.839 --> 00:43:23.861]  So we've decided to revamp some of the holiday specials, Christmas specials.
[00:43:25.562 --> 00:43:29.344]  So you can get two Berkey lights without the lights for $199 each.
[00:43:29.364 --> 00:43:35.007]  And then you can get three of the Berkey Sport bottles for free.
[00:43:35.672 --> 00:43:37.393]  And they're not the generic labeled ones.
[00:43:37.493 --> 00:43:41.535]  They're the ones that they're labeling so that they make a nice Christmas gift.
[00:43:42.275 --> 00:43:51.179]  Or you can get two of the Royal Burkis for $2.60 each and get five of the Burkis Sport Bottles.
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:55.521]  Or you can get two of the Imperial Burkis or two of the Crown Burkis.
[00:43:55.601 --> 00:43:59.723]  Well Debbie, to be serious, haven't I ordered about ten Burkis from you?
[00:43:59.743 --> 00:44:01.164]  You've ordered a whole lot.
[00:44:01.304 --> 00:44:03.785]  You've ordered a lot and a lot of Sport Bottles.
[00:44:03.845 --> 00:44:05.106]  You have a lot of good friends.
[00:44:05.816 --> 00:44:13.362]  You're giving these to family members and I'm sure that they all appreciate them because they're such a great guest.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:26.507]  People I care about, people I love, they get these and then I come over to their house and actually, I was at my parents' house two weeks ago interrogating them, demanding, you know, where is the Berkey?
[00:44:26.527 --> 00:44:28.448]  And they're like, it's right here in the cabinet, look, we use it.
[00:44:28.688 --> 00:44:30.529]  The water you're drinking is Berkey, don't worry.
[00:44:31.090 --> 00:44:31.870]  We sure love it.
[00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.452]  Your mother says it makes all the food taste better when she cooks with it.
[00:44:34.472 --> 00:44:40.976]  So I was like some kind of German, you know, marching around in World War II demanding papers on the train.
[00:44:40.996 --> 00:44:44.118]  Yeah, and you know, I had this one lady
[00:44:44.773 --> 00:45:06.899]  And she's in Hong Kong and I was talking to her last night about her Berkey and she went to like their hardware store I guess comparable to Home Depot and she got like plexiglass and little like shelves she made little shelves because she said that in Hong Kong the kitchens are very very very small
[00:45:07.814 --> 00:45:11.375]  And so she made like a little shelf and put it on the wall.
[00:45:11.455 --> 00:45:12.456]  Same thing at my parents' house.
[00:45:12.476 --> 00:45:15.437]  They live in a little 1930s rock house.
[00:45:15.457 --> 00:45:17.778]  Because they like it.
[00:45:18.418 --> 00:45:20.999]  And that's why they've got it in the cabinet because there's no room.
[00:45:21.039 --> 00:45:22.480]  That was the other part of the equation.
[00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:23.800]  She's like, it's in the cabinet.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:24.640]  I don't know.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:31.763]  And you know, there's people like if you, I have customers who they live in their RV and you know they just make a little wooden box.
[00:45:32.557 --> 00:45:32.897]  That's great!
[00:45:46.445 --> 00:45:48.847]  Or an apartment, or a huge mansion.
[00:45:48.867 --> 00:45:51.990]  Well it's simple Debbie, and I've got to run, but it's really simple.
[00:45:52.011 --> 00:45:53.572]  People need to stop procrastinating.
[00:45:53.592 --> 00:45:55.033]  Give Debbie a call right now.
[00:45:55.174 --> 00:45:56.054]  Made in America.
[00:45:56.335 --> 00:45:58.377]  They're the big national maker and distributor.
[00:45:58.677 --> 00:46:00.759]  You can buy their stuff in some stores around the country.
[00:46:01.159 --> 00:46:06.585]  Actually hundreds, but you'll be paying $300 for something you can buy for $199 and get a free gift.
[00:46:06.625 --> 00:46:07.185]  Your choice.
[00:46:07.525 --> 00:46:10.989]  When you call them, go to InfoWars.com to order, or Berkey Water.
[00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:16.732]  Or simply call toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:46:16.792 --> 00:46:18.873]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:46:18.913 --> 00:46:21.595]  Debbie, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:46:21.895 --> 00:46:27.698]  Thank you, and be sure to put your heard it on Alex Jones if you go to Berkeywater.com.
[00:46:28.338 --> 00:46:28.799]  Absolutely.
[00:46:28.819 --> 00:46:29.740]  They're in the comment section.
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:30.861]  Tell them what free gift you want.
[00:46:30.881 --> 00:46:32.022]  Thanks, Debbie.
[00:46:32.262 --> 00:46:33.283]  Always great to hear from you.
[00:46:33.584 --> 00:46:35.445]  And again, thanks for sitting through that, folks.
[00:46:35.485 --> 00:46:38.629]  And we have her up about once a week because they're a great sponsor.
[00:46:38.729 --> 00:46:39.369]  I believe in it.
[00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:44.675]  And they're responsible for our entire international shortwave, getting the word out to everybody.
[00:46:44.735 --> 00:46:45.716]  And I just believe in it.
[00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:46.917]  And it is so important.
[00:46:47.397 --> 00:46:48.198]  And give them a call.
[00:46:48.218 --> 00:46:48.278]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:46:52.422 --> 00:46:54.282]  And I wish we could spend more than five minutes on this.
[00:46:54.402 --> 00:46:56.523]  It's just, it is so important.
[00:46:57.083 --> 00:46:58.523]  I mean, I believe in this so much.
[00:46:58.583 --> 00:46:59.903]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[00:46:59.923 --> 00:47:03.124]  888-803-4438.
[00:47:03.724 --> 00:47:08.365]  And yes, you get the best discounts out there, Barnum, when you tell them Alex Jones Special.
[00:47:08.945 --> 00:47:11.685]  Okay, I'm not going to go back to the news right now.
[00:47:11.705 --> 00:47:12.786]  I'm going to go right to your calls.
[00:47:12.866 --> 00:47:13.626]  Thank you for holding.
[00:47:13.646 --> 00:47:15.746]  Let's talk to Mark in Maryland.
[00:47:15.786 --> 00:47:16.486]  Mark, go ahead.
[00:47:16.506 --> 00:47:18.247]  How you doing there, Alex?
[00:47:18.467 --> 00:47:18.787]  Good, sir.
[00:47:21.144 --> 00:47:30.192]  I've been trying to figure out who are these people, these government assassins, these people killed for the government.
[00:47:30.913 --> 00:47:32.294]  How do they recruit them?
[00:47:34.516 --> 00:47:35.817]  How much do they pay them?
[00:47:38.179 --> 00:47:39.180]  How do they get trained?
[00:47:39.921 --> 00:47:41.162]  It's very, very simple.
[00:47:41.923 --> 00:47:44.345]  It depends on what type of assassin you want to know about.
[00:47:46.033 --> 00:47:53.358]  Uh, let's say someone kills, like, a private citizen, like, um, his name, uh, Gary Webb that got killed.
[00:47:54.737 --> 00:48:01.063]  Yeah, and then the disinfo operators tried to claim that we were wrong about him shooting himself twice in the head.
[00:48:01.384 --> 00:48:03.246]  They said that was quite normal.
[00:48:03.586 --> 00:48:05.788]  Then they said, oh, his house didn't have a balcony.
[00:48:06.108 --> 00:48:10.913]  We were talking about the house he lived in two years before he was killed, which did have a balcony.
[00:48:11.153 --> 00:48:15.758]  You know, just any way to try to discredit us, again, with straw men,
[00:48:16.428 --> 00:48:20.515]  Again, most of the time you hear us being attacked for something, it isn't something we really said or did.
[00:48:20.936 --> 00:48:24.742]  They will lie and then say we did this or that.
[00:48:24.782 --> 00:48:27.046]  But Gary Webb was clearly murdered.
[00:48:27.086 --> 00:48:28.668]  He told people that he might be murdered.
[00:48:28.688 --> 00:48:30.872]  And it's just so obvious.
[00:48:31.664 --> 00:48:31.984]  Yes, yes, yes.
[00:49:01.863 --> 00:49:08.246]  Remember the 40-year-old goons that are there at the Pentagon that start chasing him and trying to kill him?
[00:49:08.846 --> 00:49:09.187]  Right.
[00:49:09.587 --> 00:49:10.527]  They have lots of those.
[00:49:10.567 --> 00:49:11.648]  And let me tell you how this works.
[00:49:12.908 --> 00:49:15.329]  They take a young gung-ho guy who's 18.
[00:49:16.030 --> 00:49:16.810]  Now he's 20.
[00:49:17.350 --> 00:49:19.271]  He goes and tries out for Green Beret.
[00:49:20.612 --> 00:49:22.333]  After the Rangers, he passes that.
[00:49:22.793 --> 00:49:26.455]  He then goes into another Special Forces unit.
[00:49:26.475 --> 00:49:28.656]  Then he moves into Delta Force.
[00:49:30.111 --> 00:49:33.573]  And they start ordering him, well go kill this communist drug dealer.
[00:49:33.673 --> 00:49:34.854]  And boy, he deserves to die.
[00:49:34.874 --> 00:49:36.155]  He's an evil commie drug dealer.
[00:49:36.175 --> 00:49:37.956]  And they show him pictures of people he's killed.
[00:49:38.016 --> 00:49:39.697]  And well, local nun he's killed.
[00:49:39.737 --> 00:49:40.898]  And we're gonna kill him.
[00:49:40.938 --> 00:49:41.458]  Go kill him.
[00:49:41.498 --> 00:49:42.499]  So he goes and kills him.
[00:49:42.979 --> 00:49:44.960]  And then next, alright, we want you to kill this guy.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.741]  And man, he's real bad.
[00:49:46.841 --> 00:49:48.142]  He's connected to drug dealers.
[00:49:48.162 --> 00:49:49.303]  And they don't show him any files.
[00:49:49.823 --> 00:49:52.905]  And then next, oh this other guy, he sold weapons to the drug dealers.
[00:49:52.965 --> 00:49:54.326]  And you know what drugs do.
[00:49:54.366 --> 00:49:55.827]  And next, you're gonna kill this guy.
[00:49:56.565 --> 00:49:58.166]  And then they just say, go kill this guy.
[00:49:58.726 --> 00:50:06.049]  And then pretty soon, they find out through psychological tests and through years, through different operations in the Middle East and everywhere else, who likes it?
[00:50:06.309 --> 00:50:08.970]  Who likes having a $3,000 a month expense card?
[00:50:09.230 --> 00:50:11.591]  Who likes having four topless dancer girlfriends?
[00:50:11.832 --> 00:50:13.032]  Who likes living in the $200,000, $300,000 house?
[00:50:13.052 --> 00:50:13.812]  Who likes driving a brand new
[00:50:18.152 --> 00:50:20.954]  You know, high quality, $100,000 Corvette.
[00:50:21.274 --> 00:50:22.995]  Who likes having all these identities?
[00:50:23.035 --> 00:50:25.197]  And who likes being able to do all this?
[00:50:25.937 --> 00:50:28.199]  And pretty soon, go kill this family!
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:35.324]  And, you know, the guys who wouldn't do that, they get shaken out, put in other units, put in places doing more legitimate work.
[00:50:35.384 --> 00:50:39.267]  The guys that like doing it, they go out and they grease whole families!
[00:50:39.287 --> 00:50:41.068]  What about the CIA agent?
[00:50:41.688 --> 00:50:42.209]  Well, stay there.
[00:50:42.269 --> 00:50:42.749]  I'll talk.
[00:50:42.769 --> 00:50:43.870]  This is a really important question.
[00:50:44.597 --> 00:50:46.478]  And we'll come back and talk a lot more about it.
[00:50:46.818 --> 00:50:48.499]  So that's how they vet these guys.
[00:50:48.539 --> 00:50:49.339]  That's how they vet them.
[00:50:50.039 --> 00:51:00.443]  Most of them, though, do end up growing up if they're not complete psychopaths, and they commit suicide, or they become missionaries, or they live out in the... They just live out in the hill country and keep to themselves.
[00:51:00.543 --> 00:51:01.303]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:02.584 --> 00:51:05.425]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.178 --> 00:51:07.480]  Alex Jones here, America.

[00:54:04.969 --> 00:54:06.490]  Alright, going back to Mark in Maryland.
[00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:09.531]  Mark, you were asking what type of hitmen does the CIA use?
[00:54:11.191 --> 00:54:26.537]  They use Mafia, and they then also, when it's in foreign countries or areas that they don't have a lot of domestic, local assets to use, you know, the local hitmen, or the local organized crime, that's who they normally use, their intermediaries.
[00:54:27.253 --> 00:54:34.897]  And through other assets, always with membranes of separation and compartmentalization, they will send in above Delta operators.
[00:54:35.437 --> 00:54:38.959]  And there's, from my information, about 10 levels above Delta.
[00:54:40.180 --> 00:54:42.181]  And by levels above, I mean different compartments.
[00:54:42.301 --> 00:54:43.642]  I mean, I don't mean more elite.
[00:54:44.541 --> 00:54:52.428]  And they've got whole, what they call squadrons, or whole units of people that'll do whatever they're told.
[00:54:52.488 --> 00:54:58.013]  And they've got guys who are somewhat competent, but very, very criminal, who like to kill women.
[00:54:58.493 --> 00:55:01.176]  And they'll give this job to Agent, you know, Vesper.
[00:55:01.736 --> 00:55:02.717]  And then they send him out.
[00:55:04.338 --> 00:55:07.201]  And there's no real Agent Vesper folks, as you said as an example.
[00:55:07.908 --> 00:55:14.513]  And they'll go out and they'll do whatever they're told, or they'll grab little kids and start cutting their fingers off and mailing them to the ambassador until he does what he's supposed to.
[00:55:14.533 --> 00:55:18.296]  I mean, they got people that'll do whatever they're told, man.
[00:55:19.065 --> 00:55:23.007]  They got people that will, uh, and they're trying to warp the whole army like that.
[00:55:23.288 --> 00:55:33.934]  They're trying to, whereas before it was hard to find these cadres, now it's torture's good on the nightly news, and the military torture's good, and hey, we ought to torture, and so it's going to be normalized.
[00:55:34.194 --> 00:55:39.537]  They're actually trying to mutate in a new way of actually farming these people.
[00:55:39.977 --> 00:55:44.900]  They're actually creating armies off of these original cadres of torturers and killers.
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.482]  Do they have any, uh,
[00:55:48.086 --> 00:55:52.388]  Police officers, like in the cities?
[00:55:52.408 --> 00:55:55.930]  Yes, Chicago, New York, but famously L.A.
[00:55:56.270 --> 00:56:00.152]  has secret units that do go around doing assassinations and killings.
[00:56:00.832 --> 00:56:03.774]  And it's all about drug dealing and murder for hire.
[00:56:04.094 --> 00:56:06.915]  And whenever they get caught, it's, we were punishing the bad guys.
[00:56:08.836 --> 00:56:08.996]  L.A.'
[00:56:08.976 --> 00:56:09.656]  's the main place.
[00:56:09.977 --> 00:56:12.278]  Boston, remember the FBI running murder for hire?
[00:56:12.298 --> 00:56:12.718]  They still do.
[00:56:13.542 --> 00:56:13.782]  Right, right.
[00:56:13.922 --> 00:56:18.467]  But then you might go to a town where it's actually good FBI agents and see that's kind of where they send the good ones.
[00:56:18.487 --> 00:56:29.738]  You know, send them out to Houston or send them to, send them to, again, you'll have big nests of good officers and good people and you'll have a whole nest of bad ones.
[00:56:29.798 --> 00:56:31.379]  It's like, that's where they gravitate.
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:32.520]  Right.
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:35.283]  It's like pirates gravitate towards pirate crews.
[00:56:36.149 --> 00:56:36.329]  Right.
[00:56:36.569 --> 00:56:48.439]  You know, when a pirate gets into shore and is looking for a new ship to ship with, he goes and joins a motley corsair out privateering illegally.
[00:56:48.940 --> 00:56:50.801]  He doesn't try to go join a king's ship.
[00:56:52.162 --> 00:56:52.402]  Right.
[00:56:54.504 --> 00:56:54.704]  Right.
[00:56:56.566 --> 00:56:56.986]  Okay.
[00:56:57.467 --> 00:56:58.087]  Thank you, sir.
[00:56:58.908 --> 00:57:00.329]  But, I mean, there's no separation.
[00:57:01.255 --> 00:57:21.124]  I mean, Delta Force, when they finally graduate, or they're about to graduate after all the strenuous, incredible training and the rest of it, and being run over in the middle of icy lakes by rubber boats, and being dropped out of helicopters without parachutes, all of this stuff, then they give them Machiavelli's The Prince, and they write an essay.
[00:57:21.404 --> 00:57:24.045]  I'm told they've changed it now.
[00:57:24.065 --> 00:57:24.586]  They don't like it.
[00:57:24.606 --> 00:57:25.406]  The secret's out.
[00:57:26.249 --> 00:57:36.736]  But you pass if you answer it psychopathically and soci... in a... in a... psychopathic... I keep overusing it.
[00:57:36.756 --> 00:57:37.756]  That's not the proper term.
[00:57:37.776 --> 00:57:39.818]  If you answer it as a sociopath would.
[00:57:41.279 --> 00:57:42.579]  Yes, it justifies the means.
[00:57:42.619 --> 00:57:45.361]  I'll torture, kill whoever to get the means done to defend America.
[00:57:45.601 --> 00:57:48.483]  I'll be more evil than evil to defend America.
[00:57:49.124 --> 00:57:53.546]  Oh, sir, you're going to be a... you're going to be a captain in Delta Force.
[00:57:53.706 --> 00:57:54.447]  Oh, you're good.
[00:57:55.348 --> 00:58:05.256]  And just, if you answer it truthfully, and as a good person, and I won't do this, and this book is degenerate, sorry sir, you just didn't have what it took.
[00:58:05.836 --> 00:58:07.277]  Get on back to Special Forces.
[00:58:08.959 --> 00:58:11.581]  Alright, and then this is how they operate.
[00:58:11.641 --> 00:58:20.147]  Look, Nazi officers wouldn't dare steal a dime on average, take good care of their children with charged machine gun nests.
[00:58:20.587 --> 00:58:21.248]  Spree to Corps!
[00:58:21.969 --> 00:58:26.310]  But they would kick a young child's brains out and enjoy it because that's what we do.
[00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:28.851]  We're elite because we'll kill children.
[00:58:29.411 --> 00:58:30.051]  Well, no, you're not.
[00:58:30.091 --> 00:58:31.071]  You're elite scum.
[00:58:32.611 --> 00:58:33.792]  You're a master of evil.
[00:58:33.832 --> 00:58:39.053]  You're not a master of spree decor or being a real warrior.
[00:58:39.453 --> 00:58:40.333]  We've got a break, folks.
[00:58:40.353 --> 00:58:42.574]  We'll be right back, so stay with us.

[00:58:57.923 --> 00:58:58.563]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.223 --> 00:59:00.284]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.984 --> 00:59:02.085]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.745 --> 00:59:03.566]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.326 --> 00:59:05.207]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.227 --> 00:59:09.689]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:14.191]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.412 --> 00:59:19.254]  My friends, we are the organic response to tyranny.
[00:59:20.771 --> 00:59:22.773]  It's not a game, it's deadly serious.
[00:59:22.833 --> 00:59:43.930]  I saw a threat to our sovereignty when I was in college and they were teaching us that world government was good, the second amendment was bad, America had to be basically brought down to third world status, and then I'd turn on the news and they'd say there's no world government, everything's fine, give up all your rights, anyone that talks about a world government's a conspiracy theorist.
[00:59:44.753 --> 00:59:53.091]  And I was going, wait a minute, they're teaching me that world government's good and I read all these documents and looked up all these globalists and this is really happening and they're going to take my freedoms and my family's freedoms?
[00:59:53.452 --> 00:59:54.414]  I've got to fight them!
[00:59:54.675 --> 00:59:55.497]  How do I fight them?
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.401]  I'll take RTF.
[00:59:57.421 --> 00:59:58.922]  I'll get involved in radio, television, and film.
[00:59:59.482 --> 01:00:01.484]  Then I went to local stations and said, I want a job.
[01:00:01.544 --> 01:00:02.405]  I want to do something.
[01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:04.286]  I want to... No!
[01:00:04.306 --> 01:00:05.627]  There's no room for people like you.
[01:00:06.067 --> 01:00:07.468]  So I got an access TV show.
[01:00:07.929 --> 01:00:09.490]  Then I got a local radio show on the weekend.
[01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:10.471]  Then I got top ratings.
[01:00:10.491 --> 01:00:11.551]  Then I got a weekly show.
[01:00:11.571 --> 01:00:12.452]  A weeknight show.
[01:00:12.472 --> 01:00:13.773]  Then I got a syndicated radio show.
[01:00:14.213 --> 01:00:17.096]  And here I am today, and I'm only one person in this fight.
[01:00:17.836 --> 01:00:20.858]  But I reach tens of millions of people a week through the websites alone.
[01:00:21.299 --> 01:00:22.880]  Millions a week through this radio show.
[01:00:23.527 --> 01:00:26.331]  And millions and millions every month of the radio interviews I do.
[01:00:27.953 --> 01:00:29.455]  And I'm not perfect.
[01:00:29.475 --> 01:00:30.657]  I don't have all the answers.
[01:00:31.918 --> 01:00:32.459]  But I know this.
[01:00:32.499 --> 01:00:34.522]  We've got an evil elite coming down on us.
[01:00:35.102 --> 01:00:36.104]  And I'm here to fight them.
[01:00:36.144 --> 01:00:36.765]  What about you?
[01:00:38.917 --> 01:00:40.879]  And I know that good always wins out over evil.
[01:00:40.959 --> 01:00:41.579]  It does.
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:45.382]  And I know we've had incredible successes.
[01:00:45.402 --> 01:00:56.611]  And I don't like these so-called patriots that get on the radio and bad-mouth each other and beat down the listeners and tell the listeners they haven't done enough and whine and complain and talk about how good they are.
[01:00:56.631 --> 01:01:00.114]  And it just saddens me to no end.
[01:01:00.154 --> 01:01:02.936]  And later I'm going to talk about this today on the show.
[01:01:02.996 --> 01:01:04.017]  It just has to be said.
[01:01:05.686 --> 01:01:07.187]  I'll go further than I've gone in the past.
[01:01:07.207 --> 01:01:08.648]  You need to know that in exposing it.
[01:01:09.889 --> 01:01:11.010]  It's been called for.
[01:01:11.090 --> 01:01:14.593]  It's a challenge that's been made and we'll just have to go further.
[01:01:15.633 --> 01:01:19.336]  But I said I'd take your calls and I've really done a good job.
[01:01:19.396 --> 01:01:21.097]  I've taken one call in the last hour.
[01:01:22.038 --> 01:01:23.759]  But I'm getting into my stride now.
[01:01:23.979 --> 01:01:26.081]  I'm going to try to just bang through your calls here now.
[01:01:26.701 --> 01:01:27.562]  Bang through them here.
[01:01:28.122 --> 01:01:28.943]  Craig in Texas.
[01:01:28.963 --> 01:01:29.623]  Go ahead, Craig.
[01:01:30.624 --> 01:01:31.064]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:31.485 --> 01:01:31.745]  Hi.
[01:01:31.765 --> 01:01:32.966]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:01:33.413 --> 01:01:33.733]  You bet.
[01:01:34.334 --> 01:01:44.361]  I had a question, but before that I wanted to know if you're aware of the massive chemtrails that were sprayed over Austin Tuesday from about four to six.
[01:01:44.481 --> 01:01:54.948]  I have several pictures of them and there were probably about four of them flying around spraying just huge smoke billows behind it.
[01:01:55.647 --> 01:02:06.754]  Yeah, for those that don't know what the subject is, until seven, eight years ago, jets flew over at high altitude, they left ice crystals behind them, they disappeared in seconds, to a maximum of two minutes, my entire life.
[01:02:07.234 --> 01:02:12.218]  Now, planes fly at 2,000 feet and leave giant, plumy trails that are there five hours later, and
[01:02:13.178 --> 01:02:23.368]  Now there are mainstream news articles admitting that something's been added to the fuel, something's going on with the atmosphere, something's changed, and we can all talk about what we think it is and what's happening.
[01:02:23.688 --> 01:02:30.254]  The problem is there's disinfo lunatics everywhere who think that any ice crystal trail is deadly poison being sprayed on us.
[01:02:30.635 --> 01:02:34.278]  They think something being sprayed at 35,000 feet is meant for you on the ground.
[01:02:34.719 --> 01:02:36.881]  No, it's meant for somebody else somewhere else in the world.
[01:02:37.701 --> 01:02:49.524]  And, uh, there are thousands of admitted springs of chemical and biologicals and radiologicals from helicopter and prop plane, uh, just since the 1940s up until the 70s when there was a declassification.
[01:02:50.264 --> 01:02:51.685]  Uh, so sure, this goes on.
[01:02:51.705 --> 01:02:53.225]  In every case, it's not happening.
[01:02:53.605 --> 01:02:55.285]  There is weather modification going on.
[01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.626]  They can control the weather.
[01:02:56.646 --> 01:02:58.646]  That's admitted and patented and triplicate.
[01:02:59.186 --> 01:03:05.728]  So, uh, yeah, there is weather modification going on on a global scale, and I don't even pretend to know the master plan of it.
[01:03:07.368 --> 01:03:13.132]  I had a question about the cell phone calls during 9-11 from the passengers.
[01:03:13.952 --> 01:03:25.060]  I saw a TV show that had actual people there, and I was wondering at what stage of when all that happened, when the calls were made.
[01:03:25.741 --> 01:03:28.462]  Well, you have to understand, you're talking about the Discovery Channel show?
[01:03:28.903 --> 01:03:29.083]  Yes.
[01:03:30.224 --> 01:03:33.546]  Did you notice that over two flights they used the same phone call?
[01:03:33.566 --> 01:03:35.527]  A person was supposedly on both flights?
[01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:38.151]  A few of these they have.
[01:03:39.012 --> 01:03:40.975]  So we can talk about that if you want.
[01:03:41.736 --> 01:03:42.617]  Briefly when we get back.
[01:03:42.697 --> 01:03:47.904]  It's just... They can... Ten years ago they could show Forrest Gump shaking hands with JFK!
[01:03:48.605 --> 01:03:50.748]  It's just... It's a fraud!
[01:03:50.768 --> 01:03:51.709]  We'll be right back!
[01:03:54.645 --> 01:03:57.507]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.747 --> 01:03:59.329]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.669 --> 01:04:04.352]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.693 --> 01:04:11.438]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.758 --> 01:04:13.741]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.941 --> 01:04:16.785]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.885 --> 01:04:21.551]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.751 --> 01:04:26.156]  Martial law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.397 --> 01:04:29.801]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy.
[01:04:29.941 --> 01:04:33.603]  And uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.843 --> 01:04:36.284]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:55.034 --> 01:04:59.538]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:59.878 --> 01:05:03.962]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:04.262 --> 01:05:04.823]  We listened.
[01:05:05.123 --> 01:05:10.107]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:10.388 --> 01:05:10.868]  We listened.
[01:05:11.248 --> 01:05:14.291]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:14.711 --> 01:05:15.252]  We listened.
[01:05:15.712 --> 01:05:19.775]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:20.155 --> 01:05:20.635]  We listened.
[01:05:20.975 --> 01:05:26.218]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:26.639 --> 01:05:27.999]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:35.744]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:36.124 --> 01:05:39.266]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by

[01:05:53.751 --> 01:05:55.772]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[01:05:56.373 --> 01:05:57.753]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:09.159]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:12.241]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.742]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[01:06:18.322 --> 01:06:23.044]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[01:06:23.564 --> 01:06:38.250]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.LibertyDollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[01:06:42.748 --> 01:06:47.700]  That's www.libertydollar.org or call toll-free 888-421-6181.
[01:06:58.169 --> 01:06:58.809]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.489 --> 01:07:00.510]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:02.430]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.030 --> 01:07:03.851]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.591 --> 01:07:06.511]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:06.531 --> 01:07:10.112]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.332 --> 01:07:14.473]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:14.493 --> 01:07:14.734]  Okay.
[01:07:14.914 --> 01:07:18.114]  You know, we need to revisit 9-11.
[01:07:18.435 --> 01:07:23.216]  I need to make a film.
[01:07:28.897 --> 01:07:40.225]  About the lies, the official lies of the establishment, and then go through and... I mean, not just the lies of their official story, but how they attack us, how they try to discredit us.
[01:07:40.245 --> 01:07:46.629]  I mean, they've got like... It's more than ten shows that I actually have on tape that I've been sent by listeners or I've watched on TV.
[01:07:47.449 --> 01:07:50.791]  Why the towers fell, how the towers were built, what brought down the towers.
[01:07:51.132 --> 01:07:52.473]  And it's always the same propaganda.
[01:07:52.493 --> 01:07:54.214]  There were no support columns in the building.
[01:07:54.254 --> 01:07:55.955]  It was the flimsiest buildings ever built.
[01:07:57.087 --> 01:07:59.190]  Uh, on and on and on and on.
[01:07:59.790 --> 01:08:02.914]  Explaining the lattice work, when that's not how the building was built.
[01:08:02.974 --> 01:08:05.597]  It had the biggest columns ever in a building up until that time.
[01:08:06.257 --> 01:08:08.159]  But they just make the columns disappear.
[01:08:09.861 --> 01:08:13.064]  They don't even mention in the 9-11 Commission Report why Building 7 fell.
[01:08:13.084 --> 01:08:15.007]  You know, they do all of this.
[01:08:15.047 --> 01:08:16.128]  But all the cell phones.
[01:08:18.453 --> 01:08:24.377]  Folks, phones don't work above 12,000 feet unless you're in the mountains.
[01:08:25.017 --> 01:08:35.444]  And speaking on that particular mountain cell phone system, which is notoriously very limited, I've actually researched this, written articles about it, and then it's line of sight to your cell phone.
[01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:42.129]  But when you're flying around in a just above sea level area of Boston and Pennsylvania,
[01:08:42.873 --> 01:08:50.176]  In other areas, and you're at 35,000 feet and 22,000 feet, you know, those, that range.
[01:08:51.476 --> 01:08:59.519]  And there's just all these little cell phone calls being made, and it wasn't by air phone or the phones that are built into the plane that let you make calls.
[01:08:59.579 --> 01:09:01.700]  No, it was people calling up.
[01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:04.020]  There's what, three phone calls?
[01:09:05.461 --> 01:09:08.162]  Including one of these government operatives, you know, calling her husband.
[01:09:09.868 --> 01:09:12.729]  And they're saying, oh, there's hijackers.
[01:09:12.869 --> 01:09:13.530]  I'm in trouble.
[01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:16.251]  They may have bombs.
[01:09:16.411 --> 01:09:17.411]  Oh, I've got to go.
[01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:17.851]  Click.
[01:09:19.552 --> 01:09:20.432]  And that's the evidence.
[01:09:20.493 --> 01:09:31.077]  And then, you watch the Discovery Channel show, and they use one phone call of what's happening with the hijackers, and use that phone call, that same person, on two of the planes.
[01:09:33.027 --> 01:09:38.090]  And I was sent this by a lawyer, it was pointed out, and I'm watching it, and on the show, that's what they show.
[01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:43.873]  And see, but the average person watches that show from an unconscious position, not a critical position.
[01:09:44.233 --> 01:09:50.837]  And so he goes, oh, I heard the callers, they've got so few of these fake calls, they use the same calls on each flight.
[01:09:52.117 --> 01:09:54.879]  There were also calls on this flight, there were also calls on that flight.
[01:09:55.159 --> 01:09:56.900]  And it's recycled, it's like Bin Laden.
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.041]  Bin Laden's back, he's alive, he's threatening us.
[01:09:59.685 --> 01:10:00.306]  Well, wait a minute.
[01:10:00.346 --> 01:10:02.268]  That's the same tape from before 9-11.
[01:10:02.588 --> 01:10:03.469]  Never mind that.
[01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:04.730]  He's back.
[01:10:06.652 --> 01:10:09.374]  He's back on national TV and there's a minor correction.
[01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:10.595]  Well, that was actually an old tape.
[01:10:10.776 --> 01:10:11.496]  And then he's back again.
[01:10:11.556 --> 01:10:12.697]  Well, that was actually an old tape.
[01:10:12.978 --> 01:10:13.638]  He's back again.
[01:10:13.658 --> 01:10:14.639]  Well, actually, that was an old tape.
[01:10:14.799 --> 01:10:15.480]  He's back again.
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:16.301]  That was actually an old tape.
[01:10:17.021 --> 01:10:18.923]  And then there's the Fat Bin Laden post-9-11.
[01:10:20.592 --> 01:10:22.933]  He suddenly had gained, literally, 150 pounds.
[01:10:22.973 --> 01:10:25.555]  He suddenly had a nose that looked completely different.
[01:10:25.915 --> 01:10:27.936]  Suddenly, his whole bone structure was fake.
[01:10:28.196 --> 01:10:35.680]  And because the guy was such a bad look-alike, they turned the lights down to dim, and it's just a big blob.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:46.546]  And then, major speech experts, computer experts in Canada, the US, MIT, France, England, it was all over the foreign news.
[01:10:47.737 --> 01:10:54.300]  They took real Bin Laden speeches, made a digital code voice recognition key with it.
[01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:56.941]  That is, they set computerized locks to it.
[01:10:58.241 --> 01:11:00.722]  With the real voice of Osama Bin Laden, the CIA asset.
[01:11:01.182 --> 01:11:08.885]  And then they took the voice of that guy, and not only did it not match, and not only did it not open the code key, then they had a linguist listen.
[01:11:08.985 --> 01:11:10.266]  Number one, it's proven not be him.
[01:11:10.996 --> 01:11:18.941]  Then they had linguists listen, and it was someone speaking Arabic who had obviously lived in America for at least ten years.
[01:11:19.222 --> 01:11:22.264]  Serious American accent to the Arabic.
[01:11:22.564 --> 01:11:24.946]  May have even been someone of non-Arabic descent.
[01:11:27.047 --> 01:11:28.868]  And that was three separate top linguists.
[01:11:29.188 --> 01:11:32.471]  So, it wasn't just fake video and a fat guy.
[01:11:32.491 --> 01:11:34.872]  And it wasn't just all fake.
[01:11:35.032 --> 01:11:35.513]  You understand?
[01:11:36.153 --> 01:11:36.994]  All fake!
[01:11:37.574 --> 01:11:38.775]  All... In fact, I'm writing that down.
[01:11:38.835 --> 01:11:39.956]  Video about their fakes.
[01:11:41.994 --> 01:11:44.935]  About their fakes.
[01:11:44.995 --> 01:11:46.936]  I might just make a film with a whole bunch of vignettes.
[01:11:46.976 --> 01:11:48.317]  A whole bunch of little pieces.
[01:11:48.337 --> 01:11:51.178]  Maybe ten films on one video.
[01:11:51.218 --> 01:11:52.818]  And I just go out and make this point.
[01:11:52.858 --> 01:11:53.819]  Go out and make that point.
[01:11:53.839 --> 01:11:55.359]  Because there's so much I want to do.
[01:11:55.419 --> 01:11:56.700]  I'm going to pull my hair out.
[01:11:59.126 --> 01:12:13.659]  Jesus, I mean, how dumb do we... Look, the Pentagon now admits that all these so-called democracy papers printing how much they love the occupation, they're all paid off, run by the CIA, all totally phony, and they go, OK, it doesn't matter, we're going to keep doing it, and by the way, we're doing it here domestically, and so what?
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:20.265]  They openly lie to you, they openly plant false intelligence, they openly create fake Yellow Cake documents, this is what they do.
[01:12:20.945 --> 01:12:24.068]  And those ridiculous cell phone calls are as phony as a $3 bill.
[01:12:25.956 --> 01:12:27.137]  Craig, does that answer your question?
[01:12:28.078 --> 01:12:33.384]  Yeah, also I was going to say, you were saying that the passengers might have been incapacitated.
[01:12:34.446 --> 01:12:35.066]  That's what happened.
[01:12:35.647 --> 01:12:38.510]  Was it before they knew anything that was going on?
[01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:40.592]  Again, it's like this.
[01:12:40.653 --> 01:12:41.734]  I'm a police detective.
[01:12:41.754 --> 01:12:42.655]  I caught the killer.
[01:12:43.837 --> 01:12:45.499]  I caught him with a dead body in his truck.
[01:12:45.619 --> 01:12:51.867]  The woman's skin is under his fingernails and there's even his admissions and he told people he was going to do it and he did it.
[01:12:53.049 --> 01:12:54.250]  But he keeps quiet.
[01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:56.213]  He won't tell me what he did first.
[01:12:57.154 --> 01:12:59.117]  Did you bound her hands first or her feet first?
[01:12:59.517 --> 01:13:00.499]  He won't tell us.
[01:13:01.329 --> 01:13:02.311]  And so we get into all that.
[01:13:02.451 --> 01:13:13.948]  All I know is it's a standard doctrine, operation, and I have Pentagon sources, and it's literally 500 other pieces of data, datum, that go into this whole picture, and we know how they did it.
[01:13:14.028 --> 01:13:14.749]  We've got them.
[01:13:15.979 --> 01:13:17.219]  I got you.
[01:13:17.479 --> 01:13:18.340]  Well, thanks a lot, Alex.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:18.920]  Thank you.
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:19.660]  I appreciate it.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:20.960]  It's a very important question.
[01:13:21.521 --> 01:13:23.481]  It's just so encyclopedic.
[01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:39.506]  I've made three 9-11 films, written a book, published a book, done probably 50 TV shows about it, probably done 200 radio shows about it, on my own show, probably done, well, not any probably, of the 3,000, almost 4,000 interviews I've done in the last four years, I'd say 80% of them are 9-11 related.
[01:13:41.355 --> 01:13:44.656]  It's sick what a sloppy job it was.
[01:13:45.177 --> 01:13:50.519]  We've got former head of the Star Wars program saying it, congressman out saying it.
[01:13:50.999 --> 01:14:00.402]  We've got former chief economist saying it, treasury department people saying it, defense language school dean saying it.
[01:14:00.642 --> 01:14:01.703]  I train these people.
[01:14:01.743 --> 01:14:02.723]  They're government officers.
[01:14:02.743 --> 01:14:04.124]  They don't even fire the dean.
[01:14:04.144 --> 01:14:05.524]  They just tell him to shut up.
[01:14:08.050 --> 01:14:09.472]  I mean, it's just, what am I supposed to do?
[01:14:09.652 --> 01:14:15.438]  German defense minister, German technology minister, number three in the Blair government going public and saying and resigning.
[01:14:15.919 --> 01:14:17.481]  You know, what am I supposed to do here?
[01:14:20.184 --> 01:14:21.765]  Physics professors saying it.
[01:14:25.114 --> 01:14:28.498]  Chief Underwriters, Underwriter Laboratories sing it.
[01:14:28.558 --> 01:14:29.700]  Firefighters sing it.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.642]  Firefighter Engineering sing it.
[01:14:31.682 --> 01:14:33.084]  Police Officers sing it.
[01:14:33.104 --> 01:14:34.645]  Eyewitnesses sing it.
[01:14:34.685 --> 01:14:36.067]  And on and on and on.
[01:14:36.327 --> 01:14:39.431]  And people say, well, if it really happened, you couldn't hide it.
[01:14:39.671 --> 01:14:41.373]  And if it really happened, people would go public.
[01:14:41.513 --> 01:14:42.635]  They have gone public!
[01:14:44.745 --> 01:14:45.686]  It's just the horror!
[01:14:45.906 --> 01:14:59.120]  Do you have the nerve to admit we got people controlling our lives, running things, who mail anthrax out at their enemies to create fear, and who carry out terror attacks, and who could do something even bigger any day?
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:14:59.900]  Well, you know what?
[01:14:59.940 --> 01:15:01.582]  Denying it doesn't make it go away.
[01:15:02.203 --> 01:15:05.186]  It's still there, facing you, looking you in the eyes.
[01:15:07.308 --> 01:15:08.769]  And if they win, I'm dead.
[01:15:08.809 --> 01:15:09.870]  A lot of us are dead.
[01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.670]  But it won't matter.
[01:15:10.690 --> 01:15:13.031]  You're going to live as slaves and you're going to be dead down the line.
[01:15:13.272 --> 01:15:14.272]  Your kids will be drafted.
[01:15:14.292 --> 01:15:15.433]  They'll be dead down the line.
[01:15:15.673 --> 01:15:17.414]  It's for all the marbles.
[01:15:17.754 --> 01:15:19.355]  Folks, I'm in this for all the marbles.
[01:15:19.775 --> 01:15:26.379]  All the way, 110%, going in to engage the enemy, point blank range, charging their nest, charging their hill.
[01:15:26.599 --> 01:15:27.880]  There is no turning back.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.020]  This is not a drill.
[01:15:29.241 --> 01:15:30.201]  This is not a joke.
[01:15:30.221 --> 01:15:30.881]  This is not a game.
[01:15:31.102 --> 01:15:34.904]  And half the patriots are running around on egomaniac trips, attacking everyone.
[01:15:35.724 --> 01:15:47.095]  Grubbing, and carpetbagging, and running around beating up their audiences, and squeezing, and just feds, obviously, or something very close to it, just running around doing their business.
[01:15:47.115 --> 01:15:47.815]  But it won't matter.
[01:15:47.995 --> 01:15:48.936]  People are discerning.
[01:15:48.956 --> 01:15:53.881]  They see right through it, and we're moving forward, and our numbers are exploding, and you just can't stop us.
[01:15:54.101 --> 01:15:58.265]  You can get some of us, but you can't get all of us, and you're going to fail.
[01:15:58.325 --> 01:15:59.045]  You hear me?
[01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:00.346]  You're going to fail.
[01:16:00.567 --> 01:16:01.928]  We're going to win this thing.
[01:16:05.121 --> 01:16:07.142]  Seth in Nebraska, thanks for holding, welcome.
[01:16:07.802 --> 01:16:08.823]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[01:16:08.863 --> 01:16:09.343]  Pretty good.
[01:16:10.444 --> 01:16:26.352]  I just wanted to know if you were aware of this new IBM commercial that seems to be promoting the idea of RFID tagging products and eventually... Let me guess, the guy goes in the store and I think he's stealing something but he's able to exit the store because he scanned.
[01:16:27.232 --> 01:16:29.893]  No, it's like this... Yeah, that's the old IBM ad, okay.
[01:16:30.434 --> 01:16:32.595]  Yeah, it's a new IBM ad, this...
[01:16:34.119 --> 01:16:43.961]  My truck is in the desert and they stop because there's this lady at this help desk just in the middle of the road in this desert and she says, uh, you guys lost?
[01:16:44.562 --> 01:16:46.182]  He's like, is this the road to Fresno?
[01:16:46.722 --> 01:16:48.663]  And she says, no, this is the road to Albuquerque.
[01:16:49.043 --> 01:16:50.483]  He's like, how'd you know where we were going?
[01:16:50.863 --> 01:16:53.964]  The products in the back of your truck have RFID tags in them.
[01:16:54.793 --> 01:17:02.700]  And the local police scanner readers, they've already put up, by the way, the Fed did, the Fed Department program, that the police will still be given... Oh, thank you, Pentagon!
[01:17:03.180 --> 01:17:04.762]  Oh, that was able to scan you!
[01:17:05.202 --> 01:17:16.632]  And, of course, the ad, I'm sure, doesn't tell you we're going to give you tickets with it for speeding, we're going to track you and fire about 80% of the cops, but don't worry, cops, you won't have the cop job anymore, you're going to have spy jobs.
[01:17:17.614 --> 01:17:24.836]  Can you think of every dim-witted, black-suited little twit who always wanted power running around as a secret agent?
[01:17:26.116 --> 01:17:26.576]  Exactly.
[01:17:26.656 --> 01:17:30.457]  Oh, the nightmare of hearing your backyard barbecuing or peeking up over the back.
[01:17:31.337 --> 01:17:32.157]  Oh, heaven help us.
[01:17:32.837 --> 01:17:46.100]  And here in Nebraska, at least here in Omaha, which is the biggest city in the state, I've noticed you've been putting up, you know, the whole intersection, putting up the Big Brother infrastructure, and now
[01:17:46.710 --> 01:17:50.172]  The license plates, the issue here in Nebraska have barcodes on them.
[01:17:50.192 --> 01:17:52.032]  Yeah, they all, exactly sir.
[01:17:52.072 --> 01:17:54.233]  Texans don't know this.
[01:17:54.253 --> 01:17:56.094]  There's already a hidden barcode on ours.
[01:17:58.415 --> 01:18:00.796]  Oh, the stickers you have on the windshield.
[01:18:01.917 --> 01:18:03.017]  I used to live in Dallas.
[01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:05.698]  They probably were doing that when I lived there.
[01:18:05.738 --> 01:18:06.519]  That was like a decade ago.
[01:18:06.679 --> 01:18:13.922]  All I know is eight years ago they started putting the readers in long before they even put it in the inspection stickers and the plates and it's just sick.
[01:18:14.902 --> 01:18:16.183]  It's sick, sick, sick.
[01:18:16.940 --> 01:18:20.421]  Also, uh, you were saying you were wanting to make another 9-11 film.
[01:18:21.442 --> 01:18:29.205]  Um, another key topic is Bush coming to Offutt Air Force Base here in Omaha and going into the bunker.
[01:18:29.625 --> 01:18:32.726]  And STRATCOM Headquarters is there at Offutt Air Force Base.
[01:18:33.266 --> 01:18:33.887]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:34.007 --> 01:18:34.787]  Your thoughts on that?
[01:18:35.047 --> 01:18:39.229]  Meeting secretly with hundreds of lavish CEOs from the globe.
[01:18:39.249 --> 01:18:44.691]  And Moway was admittedly an unscheduled stop for him, but they were magically waiting.
[01:18:46.085 --> 01:18:47.086]  Very interesting.
[01:18:47.146 --> 01:18:48.426]  It's just a coincidence.
[01:18:48.486 --> 01:18:49.066]  Please.
[01:18:49.726 --> 01:18:50.226]  Please.
[01:18:51.067 --> 01:18:51.947]  Everything's fine.
[01:18:59.429 --> 01:19:00.649]  Currency devaluation.
[01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:01.530]  Inflation.
[01:19:01.990 --> 01:19:02.690]  One and the same.
[01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:07.391]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:19:13.669 --> 01:19:16.811]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:19:17.071 --> 01:19:18.892]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:19:18.952 --> 01:19:21.973]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:19:22.514 --> 01:19:24.735]  Here is reality.
[01:19:25.095 --> 01:19:28.677]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:19:29.177 --> 01:19:32.839]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:19:33.399 --> 01:19:35.840]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:01.541]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:21:01.961 --> 01:21:04.622]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?

[01:21:54.564 --> 01:21:57.005]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:21:57.425 --> 01:22:01.926]  Did you know that Russia sponsored a terrorist training camp in Havana, Cuba in 1966?
[01:22:02.506 --> 01:22:08.168]  In this camp, they planned terrorist activity on every continent, including the United States.
[01:22:08.808 --> 01:22:12.669]  Have we seen terrorist activities on every continent just as they planned?

[01:22:53.827 --> 01:22:56.029]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:56.590 --> 01:22:59.373]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:09.075 --> 01:23:17.937]  Okay, I'm told that Wayne in Vancouver, Canada disagrees with me.
[01:23:19.238 --> 01:23:24.379]  And we're going to go to Thomas and Walt and Mary, but I've just got to go to somebody who disagrees with me.
[01:23:24.739 --> 01:23:29.360]  I don't know what about, so we'll find out right now, but I'm going to move quickly through these calls.
[01:23:29.460 --> 01:23:30.220]  Wayne, go ahead.
[01:23:30.241 --> 01:23:32.161]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[01:23:32.902 --> 01:23:34.964]  I'm actually a big fan of yours and listen to you all the time.
[01:23:34.984 --> 01:23:36.685]  Well, that's okay, but what do you disagree with?
[01:23:36.846 --> 01:23:41.910]  Well, I've heard that in the last couple of weeks, you know, the name of Paul Hellyer came up a few times.
[01:23:42.711 --> 01:23:51.038]  The former Minister of Defense in Canada, former Deputy Prime Minister, and with his talk about UFOs.
[01:23:51.118 --> 01:23:55.562]  Secret moon bases and mega beams, and we're going to have an intergalactic war with the
[01:23:56.383 --> 01:23:57.784]  With the Green Tooth Fairy, yes.
[01:23:57.864 --> 01:23:58.684]  Yeah, things like that.
[01:23:58.984 --> 01:24:02.105]  And he was on the Jeff Brent Show last night, you know.
[01:24:02.405 --> 01:24:03.966]  And he actually had a lot of good things to say.
[01:24:04.006 --> 01:24:05.886]  Now, I've never seen a UFO.
[01:24:06.126 --> 01:24:06.967]  I don't know if they exist.
[01:24:07.007 --> 01:24:10.668]  You know what, I think he's prominent enough for me to have on.
[01:24:10.728 --> 01:24:17.410]  I said that we have to listen when somebody like that, former defense minister, former somebody of that level, I said we should listen to it.
[01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:20.031]  So I don't know what the... It's just that this is an UFO show.
[01:24:20.571 --> 01:24:22.172]  No, that's true, Alex, and I appreciate that.
[01:24:22.492 --> 01:24:33.462]  But I did email you a number of times trying to get him onto your show to talk about 9-11 because he is a very skeptical person about 9-11.
[01:24:33.502 --> 01:24:35.464]  When did you send that material?
[01:24:35.544 --> 01:24:36.805]  Several times in the past year.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:41.082]  Well, I mean, what email address did you send it to?
[01:24:41.863 --> 01:24:43.824]  To tips.infowars.com.
[01:24:44.184 --> 01:24:51.609]  Well, send it again, and I guess I'm going to ask Jeff for the fast track to get that guy's contact info.
[01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:55.272]  He knows all about globalization and the New World Order.
[01:24:55.292 --> 01:24:57.033]  I've got a couple of books that he has written on that.
[01:24:57.803 --> 01:25:02.547]  He's the founder of a party called the Canadian Action Party, which is totally against globalization.
[01:25:02.907 --> 01:25:04.128]  Well, it sounds interesting.
[01:25:04.168 --> 01:25:05.709]  Send it to me again.
[01:25:05.809 --> 01:25:10.193]  And another person who is the present leader of that party is Connie Fogel.
[01:25:10.493 --> 01:25:11.233]  Lee's got her on.
[01:25:11.253 --> 01:25:14.896]  She knows all about the North American Union and all those plans.
[01:25:14.976 --> 01:25:18.419]  I know, but then they mix it into moon bases, which it may be, for all I know.
[01:25:18.459 --> 01:25:19.620]  He's out of the party now.
[01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.381]  He's definitely doing his own thing now.
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:24.222]  You know, he's 83, but he's still very lucid.
[01:25:24.523 --> 01:25:26.425]  You have a great, great... Well, I'm going to get him on.
[01:25:26.445 --> 01:25:26.985]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:27.065 --> 01:25:27.866]  OK, thanks, Al.
[01:25:27.906 --> 01:25:28.347]  You bet.
[01:25:28.467 --> 01:25:29.047]  I appreciate it.
[01:25:29.087 --> 01:25:30.309]  No, I already told my producer.
[01:25:30.349 --> 01:25:36.455]  I said I want that guy on, but, you know... Other people have contacts we don't have.
[01:25:36.495 --> 01:25:40.519]  Like, I can get a guest somebody else can't get for some reason, and then there's other guests I have trouble getting.
[01:25:40.579 --> 01:25:42.041]  I believe those calls have been made.
[01:25:42.911 --> 01:25:46.293]  Okay, I've got to go ahead and go back to the calls here.
[01:25:46.674 --> 01:25:50.316]  Let's go ahead and talk to Thomas in Pennsylvania.
[01:25:50.356 --> 01:25:51.017]  Go ahead, Thomas.
[01:25:51.277 --> 01:25:54.259]  Hey, I want to thank you for doing a good job on your radio show.
[01:25:54.359 --> 01:25:57.181]  Everything you talk about ties with the Bible at the end times.
[01:25:57.781 --> 01:26:06.407]  And what I'm calling about is the work that they had a Newsweek teen magazine for teens showing how the government's making it okay to have the chip implant.
[01:26:07.226 --> 01:26:08.026]  I'm sorry, it's Newsweek.
[01:26:08.046 --> 01:26:08.467]  I'm sorry, Newsweek.
[01:26:25.245 --> 01:26:29.747]  I mean, it actually says this, then you're going to get the chip, and so you're saying now it's even in Newsweek.
[01:26:29.847 --> 01:26:31.708]  It's in Newsweek, it's in the October issue.
[01:26:31.888 --> 01:26:32.909]  Disgusting!
[01:26:33.489 --> 01:26:35.910]  If you're really cool, you'll have it.
[01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:40.552]  How Orwellian, how out of control, nightmare is that?
[01:26:41.332 --> 01:26:44.914]  And the sad thing is, I work for School District, and they're showing a magazine in the school.
[01:26:46.824 --> 01:26:49.567]  Oh, I know, it's give it out for free to help them.
[01:26:49.647 --> 01:26:53.593]  Guns are evil, microchips are good, the world government's going to help you.
[01:26:53.813 --> 01:26:59.561]  I could make a whole film just about the free magazines and Channel One, they provide the kids in school.
[01:27:00.439 --> 01:27:02.421]  I mean, it's so sick.
[01:27:02.501 --> 01:27:02.901]  You know what?
[01:27:02.942 --> 01:27:03.862]  Send me that Newsweek.
[01:27:04.163 --> 01:27:05.424]  Okay, I have to get it off my buddy.
[01:27:05.444 --> 01:27:06.605]  Yeah, I gave it to him last night.
[01:27:06.625 --> 01:27:08.307]  You know, there's an online version, I'm sure.
[01:27:08.427 --> 01:27:10.609]  We've written articles about the Time Magazine.
[01:27:11.089 --> 01:27:11.890]  Get the shib.
[01:27:11.930 --> 01:27:13.812]  It's totally awesome.
[01:27:14.152 --> 01:27:16.134]  Yeah, and me and my buddy have been talking.
[01:27:16.174 --> 01:27:19.898]  We know that the people, like you've been saying, are waking up to what's going on.
[01:27:19.938 --> 01:27:25.363]  And we know, sooner or later, the government has to create a problem that they can get the people's minds off what's going on.
[01:27:25.954 --> 01:27:27.315]  Well, I mean, how obvious is that?
[01:27:27.335 --> 01:27:29.857]  I mean, imagine, again, I use this example a lot.
[01:27:30.237 --> 01:27:31.218]  Imagine 20 years ago.
[01:27:31.238 --> 01:27:32.499]  Have you seen a late night movie?
[01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:36.852]  Where the movie's about a janitor waking up to a weird world.
[01:27:36.972 --> 01:27:46.199]  Aliens have invaded and they've taken control of the publications and they're telling you, take your microchip, it's normal, it's good, everything's fine, global government.
[01:27:46.479 --> 01:27:49.982]  You know, take the aliens out of it though, this is the real world.
[01:27:50.182 --> 01:27:50.903]  Yeah it is.
[01:27:51.443 --> 01:27:57.248]  And it is body snatcher level weird, but we just calmly watch Andy Rooney
[01:27:57.888 --> 01:28:00.490]  Get up on TV and say we all need chips to prove we're good.
[01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:03.633]  That is off the charts, out of control.
[01:28:03.993 --> 01:28:07.295]  That's like a friend of mine, he belongs to the 4-H club with his kids.
[01:28:07.776 --> 01:28:07.896]  Oh.
[01:28:08.036 --> 01:28:11.018]  They're not even allowed to mention Christmas no more because the deal is crazy.
[01:28:11.138 --> 01:28:12.099]  Oh, it's hateful.
[01:28:12.179 --> 01:28:14.741]  And you'll be kicked out if you're wearing a cross.
[01:28:15.101 --> 01:28:18.944]  But you can love Harry Potter and learn about sorcery.
[01:28:19.044 --> 01:28:20.225]  Well, they teach that at school.
[01:28:20.625 --> 01:28:22.126]  Of course they do.
[01:28:22.707 --> 01:28:23.707]  Thank you, buddy.
[01:28:23.848 --> 01:28:25.249]  Our leader believes in that.
[01:28:25.749 --> 01:28:26.890]  Our Christian leader.
[01:28:27.904 --> 01:28:29.004]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[01:28:29.945 --> 01:28:30.585]  Stay with us.
[01:28:31.325 --> 01:28:34.306]  Oh no, it's just so over-the-top sick.
[01:28:34.406 --> 01:28:35.066]  I mean, literally.
[01:28:35.106 --> 01:28:37.206]  You ought to go read what's in Time Magazine for kids.
[01:28:37.747 --> 01:28:38.387]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:38.427 --> 01:28:40.527]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com.
[01:28:40.747 --> 01:28:41.768]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[01:28:41.788 --> 01:28:42.108]  Stay tuned.
[01:28:44.048 --> 01:28:44.928]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.429 --> 01:28:47.009]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.949 --> 01:28:50.630]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.238 --> 01:29:01.120]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:14.145]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest-growing business opportunity in America today.
[01:29:14.445 --> 01:29:16.165]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[01:29:16.326 --> 01:29:19.786]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[01:29:20.067 --> 01:29:23.848]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[01:29:24.108 --> 01:29:29.069]  Whatever it is you seek, Dango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[01:29:29.349 --> 01:29:31.050]  So take matters into your own hands.
[01:29:31.310 --> 01:29:35.291]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[01:29:35.551 --> 01:29:37.391]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[01:29:37.551 --> 01:29:40.132]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.
[01:29:43.573 --> 01:29:44.154]  I think so.
[01:29:54.048 --> 01:30:00.272]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:30:00.433 --> 01:30:06.577]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:30:06.877 --> 01:30:15.303]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:30:15.543 --> 01:30:22.568]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:30:22.868 --> 01:30:27.690]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:30:27.910 --> 01:30:33.313]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:30:33.653 --> 01:30:36.735]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:30:37.075 --> 01:30:44.978]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.078 --> 01:30:45.659]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.502 --> 01:31:00.865]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.085 --> 01:31:06.087]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:31:06.427 --> 01:31:14.330]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:21.513]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:21.733 --> 01:31:22.954]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:23.094 --> 01:31:26.497]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:31:26.557 --> 01:31:27.658]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:31:27.958 --> 01:31:29.240]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:36.266]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:31:36.386 --> 01:31:38.848]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[01:31:39.008 --> 01:31:41.929]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free 866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.949 --> 01:31:41.989]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.009 --> 01:31:42.969]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.989 --> 01:31:47.450]  Alright, I've got to really go for your calls, Courtney, because I'm just looking at all this news during the break.
[01:32:07.876 --> 01:32:25.060]  Were the levees bombed in New Orleans, and this is MSNBC, Ninth Ward residents give voice to conspiracy theory, and they've got all these eyewitnesses who aren't little gangbangers, as the media's trying to say, little old ladies that saw the explosions go off, heard them go off, things of that nature, and then it gives a lot of credence to it.
[01:32:25.120 --> 01:32:33.182]  Now they're saying, we're not going to rebuild any of that, we're going to make it Greenbelt, and it's going to be a big economic global zone, property thieving,
[01:32:35.550 --> 01:32:36.191]  Okay, side issue.
[01:32:36.231 --> 01:32:37.192]  I'm going to get into that later.
[01:32:37.212 --> 01:32:39.874]  There is just so much here I want to cover.
[01:32:41.275 --> 01:32:50.283]  But I do want to at least talk to Walt, May, Tony, and Tom, and then I'm going to get into news for a while and then back into your calls throughout the third hour.
[01:32:51.825 --> 01:32:54.727]  But I have not yet lavished my videos today.
[01:32:54.747 --> 01:32:56.949]  We're already more than halfway into the transmission.
[01:32:58.010 --> 01:32:59.792]  Look, it's simple.
[01:33:02.723 --> 01:33:08.607]  I have made the premier, admittedly the best, anti-New World Order documentaries out there, bar none.
[01:33:09.167 --> 01:33:11.329]  Totally jam-packed with information.
[01:33:11.429 --> 01:33:13.190]  Every film covers scores of topics.
[01:33:13.870 --> 01:33:16.012]  Take the classic 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:33:16.892 --> 01:33:17.833]  Let's say you've already got it.
[01:33:19.074 --> 01:33:21.756]  And you made a few copies a few years ago, but you haven't made any more copies.
[01:33:21.796 --> 01:33:22.576]  Please make more copies.
[01:33:22.616 --> 01:33:23.677]  Please put it on AXS TV.
[01:33:24.017 --> 01:33:25.078]  Please give them as Christmas gifts.
[01:33:25.098 --> 01:33:26.399]  You want to give somebody a nice Christmas gift?
[01:33:26.419 --> 01:33:28.420]  Instead of just giving them some burned copy,
[01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:34.261]  On DVD or some VHS copy, why not buy some of the originals?
[01:33:34.461 --> 01:33:38.543]  Why not buy the nice pretty cover case with the artwork on the top of the DVD?
[01:33:38.583 --> 01:33:40.024]  Why not make it a stockings cover?
[01:33:40.384 --> 01:33:46.247]  Why not give it to someone or get my new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State, a mini-series?
[01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:48.589]  Covering the latest police state developments.
[01:33:48.929 --> 01:33:51.112]  How, why, just everything.
[01:33:51.172 --> 01:33:52.993]  How the globalists carried out 9-11.
[01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:54.715]  Totally covers that in Part 2.
[01:33:55.016 --> 01:33:56.457]  Part 3, who the globalists are.
[01:33:56.517 --> 01:33:57.738]  What their master plan is.
[01:33:58.119 --> 01:34:00.281]  What their ideology and philosophy is.
[01:34:01.162 --> 01:34:02.263]  Such an important film.
[01:34:03.214 --> 01:34:05.616]  And then there's my new film, The Order of Death.
[01:34:05.856 --> 01:34:19.844]  Hard-hitting, 45 minutes long, the history of the Illuminati, how it goes back to Egypt and Babylon, how it ties into Skull and Bones, new video, inside a bohemian grove, inside the owl, up close, the effigies, everything!
[01:34:19.864 --> 01:34:23.587]  I mean, this is exciting, this is a big deal.
[01:34:23.667 --> 01:34:30.551]  I commend the gentleman that worked there and was able to, never told us he was even working there, and just got the footage and gave it to us and quit.
[01:34:32.210 --> 01:34:35.092]  Just amazing stuff in this new film, The Order of Death.
[01:34:35.132 --> 01:34:45.379]  And on the same DVD, the re-edited, remastered, updated 2005 edition of our 2000 film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.462]  And people said that they loved and really woke a lot of people up.
[01:34:51.563 --> 01:34:54.184]  But I made that in about three weeks, folks, because we were getting death threats.
[01:34:54.344 --> 01:34:55.885]  After we snuck out of there, we were getting threats.
[01:34:57.506 --> 01:35:01.249]  Late at night, until 5 a.m., making that video.
[01:35:01.289 --> 01:35:05.712]  It was pretty good, but not thrown together, but hurriedly cut together.
[01:35:06.072 --> 01:35:12.336]  Well, I took my time and spent months re-editing that, remastering that, and making a new film that introduces you to it.
[01:35:12.757 --> 01:35:15.479]  And then, okay, you've seen The Order of Death, now watch this.
[01:35:15.959 --> 01:35:17.160]  Perfect for your pastor.
[01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:19.842]  Perfect for your leader, your religious leader.
[01:35:20.222 --> 01:35:25.085]  Perfect for the theology or philosophy class at college.
[01:35:25.606 --> 01:35:26.106]  Perfect.
[01:35:27.499 --> 01:35:32.482]  Uh, film to watch at a dinner party, you know, in two, three hours long, 45 minutes long.
[01:35:33.263 --> 01:35:34.824]  That's how long an average TV show is.
[01:35:35.064 --> 01:35:36.745]  45 minutes of program, 15 minutes of ads.
[01:35:37.085 --> 01:35:38.666]  Well, this doesn't, this doesn't have the ads.
[01:35:38.746 --> 01:35:48.592]  It's a 45 minute program, uh, the classical media dose, and then after it, another hour and 35 minute film, The Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:35:49.172 --> 01:35:52.774]  And you get one copy of that, both films, for the price of one, $24.95, each additional copy, $9.95.
[01:35:57.558 --> 01:35:58.198]  Do not wait.
[01:35:58.258 --> 01:35:58.999]  Do not procrastinate.
[01:35:59.039 --> 01:36:03.020]  I'm only offering this deal $9.95 each additional copy until the new year.
[01:36:04.041 --> 01:36:06.382]  So please take advantage of this now.

[01:37:39.497 --> 01:37:44.618]  And we come back and put it together for you, and special reports inside a Masonic Temple.

[01:38:03.536 --> 01:38:05.717]  We work hard here.
[01:38:06.438 --> 01:38:08.939]  And your support is fueling our fighter bombers' tanks.
[01:38:10.139 --> 01:38:15.722]  I mean, I image my operations as a fighter bomber pounding deep into enemy territory, exposing these sick freaks.
[01:38:16.322 --> 01:38:19.103]  So PrisonPlanet.tv, we've added all my films.
[01:38:20.167 --> 01:38:25.928]  My new film, my weekly TV report, special reports, a bunch of other films, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[01:38:26.208 --> 01:38:27.369]  It's ridiculous, folks.
[01:38:27.589 --> 01:38:29.109]  You can download, burn copies.
[01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:30.529]  Talk about an activist center.
[01:38:31.029 --> 01:38:35.931]  PrisonPlanet.tv, you can go in there and download and burn copies of all my films.
[01:38:35.971 --> 01:38:36.811]  Pretty good quality.
[01:38:37.431 --> 01:38:40.992]  Not as good as getting the original DVD or VHS, but pretty good quality and watchable.
[01:38:41.972 --> 01:38:44.052]  On the disc, on the tapes, give it to people.
[01:38:44.532 --> 01:38:45.253]  It's incredible!
[01:38:47.461 --> 01:38:50.864]  Print copies of my book, Paul Watson's book, run around, give them to people.
[01:38:51.244 --> 01:38:54.847]  We're in this to win, folks, and when you move, it's unstoppable.
[01:38:54.887 --> 01:38:58.510]  So, 15 cents a day, monthly subscriptions, and we got a new deal.
[01:38:59.270 --> 01:39:03.213]  We did give you three months free if you got a yearly subscription.
[01:39:03.954 --> 01:39:07.817]  We knocked it down by $10 more, so what is it, like five months free?
[01:39:09.156 --> 01:39:14.579]  You know, when you get a yearly subscription right now, that's only through the New Year.
[01:39:14.679 --> 01:39:16.380]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:17.901]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:39:18.081 --> 01:39:18.301]  Alright!
[01:39:18.801 --> 01:39:19.622]  There's my plug!
[01:39:20.062 --> 01:39:20.402]  Rah!
[01:39:20.482 --> 01:39:21.043]  Fuel us!
[01:39:22.443 --> 01:39:22.884]  You know what?
[01:39:23.104 --> 01:39:24.765]  I've got to stop drinking Starbucks coffee.
[01:39:25.205 --> 01:39:26.606]  I'm already a hyper person.
[01:39:28.247 --> 01:39:31.008]  My beautiful, wonderful wife bought this Christmas blend.
[01:39:31.028 --> 01:39:33.350]  And I'm not going to lie to you, it is...
[01:39:35.066 --> 01:39:36.186]  I almost got off coffee.
[01:39:36.226 --> 01:39:40.828]  I was doing half and half and then quartered, 75% decaffeinated.
[01:39:41.548 --> 01:39:42.568]  I have backslidden.
[01:39:43.868 --> 01:39:45.229]  No more tobacco.
[01:39:45.309 --> 01:39:47.309]  Don't even let myself drink the brewski anymore.
[01:39:47.929 --> 01:39:48.710]  Beer here or there.
[01:39:49.150 --> 01:39:50.490]  I've cut everything out but this.
[01:39:50.890 --> 01:39:52.791]  I tell you, I think sometimes I have better shows.
[01:39:53.271 --> 01:39:55.952]  Last week I did a show without coffee and it was a more calm show.
[01:39:58.706 --> 01:39:59.426]  What am I doing?
[01:39:59.947 --> 01:40:02.387]  Oh, by the way, what am I doing going to Starbucks?
[01:40:02.407 --> 01:40:04.148]  Well, the coffee just tastes better.
[01:40:04.168 --> 01:40:05.349]  It's so much stronger.
[01:40:05.949 --> 01:40:08.830]  Normal cup of coffee has 50 milligrams of caffeine.
[01:40:09.390 --> 01:40:12.971]  Do you know what Starbucks has in it, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:40:12.991 --> 01:40:12.971]  300.
[01:40:13.111 --> 01:40:19.494]  And I think this is even stronger than 300 milligrams.
[01:40:20.474 --> 01:40:21.175]  Alright, there you have it.
[01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:22.615]  We're talking about caffeine now.
[01:40:25.176 --> 01:40:27.317]  Let's go ahead and take some phone calls.
[01:40:28.272 --> 01:40:33.373]  I'm like the Too Much Coffee Man on that Beavis show they had on MTV many years ago.
[01:40:33.833 --> 01:40:35.774]  Walt in Missouri, good to hear from you.
[01:40:35.794 --> 01:40:36.754]  Is this my buddy, Walt?
[01:40:37.234 --> 01:40:38.175]  You betcha, Alex.
[01:40:38.315 --> 01:40:40.035]  Good afternoon, and God bless ya.
[01:40:40.235 --> 01:40:42.516]  Well, you're always welcome to call, my compadre.
[01:40:42.756 --> 01:40:49.237]  Well, you know, I've tried to call a few times, and the line's always busy, and I listen most every day.
[01:40:49.317 --> 01:40:55.559]  Of course, I'm sometimes in and out of the truck, and don't always get to hear everything, but I catch you from 9 to midnight at night.
[01:40:56.451 --> 01:41:02.794]  You know, on short waves, so I don't really feel like I missed anything anyway.
[01:41:03.214 --> 01:41:06.316]  You're able to listen on good old KCXL, aren't you?
[01:41:06.536 --> 01:41:07.836]  You betcha, you betcha.
[01:41:08.257 --> 01:41:08.457]  Yep.
[01:41:08.737 --> 01:41:16.100]  And all your callers are normally so good anyway that I feel that, well, you know, I'll just listen.
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:17.981]  You know, if I can't get in, I'll just listen.
[01:41:18.001 --> 01:41:18.762]  That'll be fine.
[01:41:18.802 --> 01:41:25.705]  But I heard you call today for people, first-time callers and people that haven't called in a long time, and I thought, well, I'll give it a shot.
[01:41:26.499 --> 01:41:31.041]  Well, I want you to know, folks, you need to get his videos, like he said.
[01:41:31.061 --> 01:41:48.469]  I'm going to tell you, I go, I'm into classic cars, you know, drag racing and all this stuff, and every swap meet and car show and stuff that I go to, I've got 50 or 60 of Alex's videos sitting on the table with a great big FREE sign on them, and my 13-year-old son, yeah, Josh is 13 now, and uh,
[01:41:52.628 --> 01:41:54.048]  Well, he'll be 14 this March.
[01:41:54.849 --> 01:41:57.369]  How's the son that's been in Iraq, the Marine?
[01:41:58.730 --> 01:42:00.050]  He's doing fine.
[01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:05.751]  I guess he didn't get so far any contamination that we can tell.
[01:42:06.252 --> 01:42:11.333]  Even though he was over there at Camp Anaconda and tramped around in it.
[01:42:11.393 --> 01:42:18.975]  By the way, for those that don't think that you've told the truth about Iraq, Saddam Hussein
[01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:22.810]  His right-hand man, Tariq Aziz, was Christian.
[01:42:23.611 --> 01:42:31.781]  And on the base that my son was at, it was an air base, and it was so dangerous over there that the Air Force wouldn't even keep planes there.
[01:42:32.822 --> 01:42:38.468]  But on that base, right across the street from each other, was a Christian church and a Muslim mosque.
[01:42:40.526 --> 01:42:43.609]  So, there you go, and it's not anything that the military built.
[01:42:43.989 --> 01:42:45.070]  It had been there for years.
[01:42:45.290 --> 01:42:46.191]  Well, not anymore.
[01:42:46.431 --> 01:42:49.774]  Our government's installed a radical Islamist system, so it's over for the Christians now.
[01:42:50.174 --> 01:42:50.575]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:50.615 --> 01:42:51.395]  Good job, Bush.
[01:42:51.415 --> 01:42:52.797]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:42:52.837 --> 01:42:53.737]  Great job, yeah.
[01:42:54.898 --> 01:43:02.865]  You know, I wanted to say, I took your advice, and, you know, being an ex-pilot and working in military intelligence,
[01:43:04.811 --> 01:43:13.353]  Uh, took your advice and I'm spreading the word about all the information that I know and all the stuff I can hear on your show because I know everything on your show is documented.
[01:43:13.393 --> 01:43:18.134]  In other words, you wouldn't open your mouth and talk about it unless you've got the paperwork to back it up.
[01:43:19.014 --> 01:43:20.834]  Uh, and that's the one thing I loved about you.
[01:43:20.874 --> 01:43:22.575]  In fact, that's why I got hooked up with you.
[01:43:22.595 --> 01:43:26.776]  You know, I gave you two weeks to give me the info and I went on the internet and checked it all out.
[01:43:27.276 --> 01:43:29.116]  And then that's when I ordered every tape you had.
[01:43:29.516 --> 01:43:32.997]  Because, like, well, this guy's speaking the facts.
[01:43:33.715 --> 01:43:38.398]  And I've been speaking the facts for years, but nobody listens to me because I got no documentation here.
[01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:39.198]  Here's the video.
[01:43:40.099 --> 01:43:40.399]  You know?
[01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:54.848]  And, uh, anyway, the bottom line is, uh, you know, it just amazes me that all these shows that I go to where I'm giving away your tapes, there is new audience everywhere.
[01:43:54.968 --> 01:43:56.609]  In other words, wow, what's this about?
[01:43:57.071 --> 01:44:00.913]  And like I said, Josh is very institutional in this, because he's watched every one of them.
[01:44:00.953 --> 01:44:04.235]  I've made him watch every one of them, because I want him to know what's going on.
[01:44:05.395 --> 01:44:16.521]  And, uh, while I'm busy helping somebody, or talking about the cars, or this or that, or whatever, why, he's over here at the table, explaining parts of the video to them.
[01:44:17.281 --> 01:44:25.045]  And there's only one person we've ever met, at one of these shows, that knew who you were.
[01:44:25.788 --> 01:44:28.389]  And he came up to me and he wanted to shake my hand.
[01:44:28.429 --> 01:44:31.071]  He said, because he said, I appreciate what you're doing.
[01:44:31.111 --> 01:44:34.313]  He said, and I'm amazed that, you know, there's somebody here in Missouri.
[01:44:34.333 --> 01:44:37.975]  And this guy was from California that knew who Alex Jones was.
[01:44:37.995 --> 01:44:41.056]  And I said, well, I said, you know, I've been doing this for years.
[01:44:41.177 --> 01:44:42.777]  I said, you know, yeah.
[01:44:43.618 --> 01:44:45.479]  And yeah, it's an investment, folks.
[01:44:45.939 --> 01:44:47.240]  You got to buy tapes and
[01:44:48.001 --> 01:44:52.446]  DVDs and all this, and I don't know, you know, and that's not just the expense!
[01:44:52.586 --> 01:45:00.596]  I don't know how many video recorders I've gone through, you know, and thrown out for the scrap pile, uh, you know, because I've just wore them out!
[01:45:01.868 --> 01:45:04.269]  Well, it's very effective.
[01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:07.131]  Walt, I don't want you to be as big a stranger as you've been.
[01:45:07.151 --> 01:45:10.432]  It was great meeting you when I was up there at that big event at KCXL.
[01:45:10.452 --> 01:45:13.874]  I've got to come back up and do one of those sometime again in the future.
[01:45:14.854 --> 01:45:23.238]  But what do you think about all the torture and the lies and just all the craziness and the attack on the Bill of Rights, all the things we've seen happen?
[01:45:23.879 --> 01:45:30.522]  Well, you know, Alex, as a retired Marine, I swore an oath to the Constitution, and that's one reason that I'm on the bandwagon here.
[01:45:31.565 --> 01:45:38.469]  Uh, because, uh, when I swore an oath to the Constitution to protect and defend my country and its people, I took that oath seriously.
[01:45:38.509 --> 01:45:44.193]  That wasn't just something that when I got, uh, you know, out, that I just threw down in the corner and forgot about.
[01:45:45.133 --> 01:46:00.182]  And, uh, as far as the torture, uh, my attitude is, uh, you know, as one time, as a one time ground pounder walking in Vietnam, uh, you know, if I capture the folks, then I'm going to have to treat them decent.
[01:46:02.266 --> 01:46:05.328]  Well, they were the bad guys because they did torture you guys.
[01:46:05.589 --> 01:46:07.110]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:46:07.150 --> 01:46:12.554]  But the bottom line is, you know, once you capture them, you know, we're supposed to be above all of this.
[01:46:12.655 --> 01:46:15.237]  I mean, you know, I consider myself above it.
[01:46:15.637 --> 01:46:16.618]  I mean, I wouldn't do it.
[01:46:18.319 --> 01:46:20.641]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:46:20.721 --> 01:46:21.382]  And the lies?
[01:46:22.122 --> 01:46:23.664]  And the media being bought?
[01:46:24.384 --> 01:46:26.206]  And all of this?
[01:46:26.366 --> 01:46:29.689]  I mean, you know, and then they got pay in the media over in Iraq?
[01:46:30.476 --> 01:46:33.497]  And, I mean, you know, come on folks, it's not just I write it here.
[01:46:33.517 --> 01:46:37.718]  That's the reason that I tell everybody never turn your TV on.
[01:46:37.838 --> 01:46:38.438]  Leave it off!
[01:46:38.698 --> 01:46:39.278]  No, I hear you.
[01:46:39.338 --> 01:46:40.739]  Walt, it's good hearing from you and take care.
[01:46:40.759 --> 01:46:41.379]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:46:41.639 --> 01:46:42.459]  Take care, my friend.
[01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:58.904]  We'll take a few more calls and get back into the news for a spell, but let me just... He mentioned something that made me remember that I was listening to NPR, stuck in traffic a couple days ago for about an hour, and so I got to listen to about three or four different segments
[01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:01.741]  Part of one show and part of another show.
[01:47:03.141 --> 01:47:06.002]  And it was different guests, different topics, kept bringing up, bringing up.
[01:47:06.022 --> 01:47:07.022]  You know, they get talking points.
[01:47:08.123 --> 01:47:11.164]  You know, Iraq really needs to be four different countries.
[01:47:11.224 --> 01:47:14.685]  You know, that's what it used to be for the British to cover.
[01:47:14.845 --> 01:47:16.486]  Oh, it ought to be Balkanized.
[01:47:16.626 --> 01:47:17.646]  Oh, that's the plan.
[01:47:18.507 --> 01:47:20.867]  Oh, that's what this new movie, Syriana, is about.
[01:47:20.967 --> 01:47:21.988]  Oh, that'll help.
[01:47:22.108 --> 01:47:28.350]  Oh, we just need to... That was the plan all along, was to screw that country up and break it up.
[01:47:29.056 --> 01:47:37.639]  And to have all these regional governments tied into this weak central puppet government that just controls the resources.
[01:47:39.320 --> 01:47:41.620]  And they didn't want a strong Arab country, and that's what they've done.
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:45.562]  And we knew that from the start!
[01:47:45.862 --> 01:47:54.425]  The operation is to have a big quagmire, feed the troops in, screw the country up, and then bring in UN troops to kind of police a new government and pull out.
[01:47:55.262 --> 01:47:56.984]  And that's exactly what's being done.
[01:47:57.344 --> 01:48:03.610]  We told you two years before the war, we told you for the last two and a half years, and now it's all over the news.
[01:48:03.710 --> 01:48:10.636]  I saw it on TV last night, turned on TV, so somebody punched a button, and now they're announcing the exit strategy.
[01:48:10.696 --> 01:48:17.882]  NATO and UN, I-4 troops, and four to three regions in total, and that was the Israeli plan in 1983.
[01:48:19.298 --> 01:48:22.380]  And then that was the plan picked up by the neocons, and that's been the plan all along.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:30.064]  And they'll keep all the contractors in there and pay money into that black hole and just basically have... It's the Balkanization.
[01:48:30.104 --> 01:48:30.805]  It's like the Balkans.
[01:48:32.686 --> 01:48:33.146]  And that's it.
[01:48:34.347 --> 01:48:35.588]  And now that's what's gonna happen.
[01:48:36.308 --> 01:48:40.531]  And we'll hear how we were bad and we were failures, and we'll know that the globalists did not fail.
[01:48:40.551 --> 01:48:42.372]  They're doing exactly what they said they'd do.
[01:48:42.972 --> 01:48:47.755]  And to all the neocons that are listening to the radio, they'll all just suck their thumbs and think, well, we tried our best.
[01:48:48.542 --> 01:48:50.624]  It just makes me sick.
[01:48:51.244 --> 01:48:52.085]  Who's up next here?
[01:48:53.085 --> 01:48:53.405]  Tony?
[01:48:54.846 --> 01:48:55.887]  Oh, Mary in Kansas.
[01:48:55.967 --> 01:48:56.748]  Okay, go ahead, Mary.
[01:48:56.768 --> 01:48:57.228]  You're up first.
[01:48:57.248 --> 01:48:57.548]  Sorry.
[01:48:58.289 --> 01:49:01.151]  Well, I also just want to say God bless you for what you're doing.
[01:49:01.611 --> 01:49:02.732]  I'm a first-time caller.
[01:49:03.032 --> 01:49:03.392]  Welcome.
[01:49:03.833 --> 01:49:04.253]  Thank you.
[01:49:04.653 --> 01:49:06.615]  And I've been listening to you for a few years now.
[01:49:07.395 --> 01:49:11.498]  I wanted to also bring up the IBM commercials.
[01:49:12.645 --> 01:49:15.047]  I wanted to bring in the newest one they've got.
[01:49:15.527 --> 01:49:18.049]  It's wonderful, Laura, how he tracks us and keeps us safe.
[01:49:18.369 --> 01:49:19.850]  I haven't seen it, but I'm getting calls about it.
[01:49:19.890 --> 01:49:20.351]  Tell me about it.
[01:49:20.371 --> 01:49:23.433]  Yeah, this one I think refers more to the Marks of the People.
[01:49:24.173 --> 01:49:34.841]  It shows a bank, and there's three robbers, guys breaking into the vault, and there's a man sitting at his desk, and he tells... Tell you what, stay there.
[01:49:34.861 --> 01:49:41.346]  I want to hear about how having a chip under our skin will save us from Al-Qaeda and the bank robbers.
[01:49:42.370 --> 01:49:43.631]  Everything else for that matter.
[01:49:43.711 --> 01:49:47.314]  I mean, you're not for the terrorists, are you?
[01:49:47.394 --> 01:49:49.336]  I mean, we'll be right back.
[01:49:54.674 --> 01:50:02.058]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.318 --> 01:50:07.060]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.923]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.183 --> 01:50:17.704]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:17.924 --> 01:50:25.065]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.085 --> 01:50:29.626]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.786 --> 01:50:32.287]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:50:32.527 --> 01:50:39.228]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[01:51:12.466 --> 01:51:12.806]  We're good to go!
[01:51:29.042 --> 01:51:29.542]  That's right!
[01:51:29.722 --> 01:51:36.826]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.

[01:51:55.410 --> 01:51:55.850]  Thank you.
[01:52:10.698 --> 01:52:11.358]  We're good to go!
[01:52:40.234 --> 01:52:43.319]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:49.349]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:53:10.162 --> 01:53:27.467]  There's a lot of ads that I've had a chance to see where the guy goes in the grocery store and he's stuffing a ham in his shirt and biscuits and a drink and you see the security guard looking at him and he's real, you know, handsome and leather jacket, totally trendy and totally stylish.
[01:53:27.507 --> 01:53:28.188]  Of course he is.
[01:53:29.748 --> 01:53:35.730]  And he's got a chip in his card and so he doesn't even, this has been on the air for five years,
[01:53:36.681 --> 01:53:42.603]  And you think the cop's about to bust in the security guard, but he says, excuse me, sir, real politely, and the guy turns around, yeah, what do you want?
[01:53:42.643 --> 01:53:46.224]  He goes, your receipt, because he was scanned.
[01:53:47.965 --> 01:53:49.125]  I haven't seen these new ads.
[01:53:49.765 --> 01:53:50.786]  I'm kind of at a disadvantage.
[01:53:50.846 --> 01:53:52.206]  I don't watch that much TV.
[01:53:53.086 --> 01:53:56.307]  But tell us more about it, Mary, please.
[01:53:57.168 --> 01:53:57.508]  Oh, OK.
[01:53:57.688 --> 01:54:03.830]  Anyways, it's the vault setting in a bank, and the three guys break in, and there's a man sitting at the desk.
[01:54:05.144 --> 01:54:06.365]  And they want to know where the money is.
[01:54:06.425 --> 01:54:08.106]  There's no money in the bank, apparently.
[01:54:08.766 --> 01:54:09.126]  At all.
[01:54:09.786 --> 01:54:15.409]  And I can't remember what terms he uses, but he uses a lot of different computer terms.
[01:54:16.330 --> 01:54:18.531]  How it's safer without cash.
[01:54:19.691 --> 01:54:27.055]  And he informs them about this, that you no longer need cash, that it's a safer system, and he starts to tell them all the details.
[01:54:28.096 --> 01:54:31.918]  And then in the end, he looks at them and asks who they are, and they say, oh, they're the cleaning crew.
[01:54:33.416 --> 01:54:35.057]  And that's how it's done.
[01:54:35.117 --> 01:54:35.557]  Oh, yes.
[01:54:35.597 --> 01:54:36.438]  We'll all be safe.
[01:54:36.458 --> 01:54:38.980]  There won't be any digital manipulation of money.
[01:54:39.000 --> 01:54:41.241]  There won't be any online hacking.
[01:54:41.321 --> 01:54:48.226]  I have two articles today where companies and governments are on purpose, and again, they say it's accidental.
[01:54:48.286 --> 01:54:49.667]  It's totally obvious it's on purpose.
[01:54:49.687 --> 01:54:50.567]  They're never prosecuted.
[01:54:51.128 --> 01:54:54.330]  Giving all your data to thieves and known criminal groups.
[01:54:54.990 --> 01:54:58.873]  And then this, that's where 80 plus percent of the identity theft is coming from.
[01:54:59.480 --> 01:54:59.700]  Right.
[01:55:00.001 --> 01:55:00.761]  But they don't care.
[01:55:00.801 --> 01:55:09.528]  They're just going to keep telling you that the cashless society will save you when they had the former head of Scotland Yard Computer Crimes go public.
[01:55:09.568 --> 01:55:14.972]  Another MI6 high level agent went public and said, no, this is going to increase identity theft.
[01:55:15.913 --> 01:55:22.178]  Yeah, the main thing is people need to get, they need to get informed, but they also need to get back with God.
[01:55:22.798 --> 01:55:24.179]  I mean, that's where we're at.
[01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:27.082]  And you're going to have to make a choice.
[01:55:27.142 --> 01:55:28.523]  Do not take the tip.
[01:55:29.589 --> 01:55:33.893]  I mean, once you've made your choice, there is no going back.
[01:55:34.153 --> 01:55:35.054]  Absolutely, Mary.
[01:55:35.094 --> 01:55:35.855]  Thanks for the call.
[01:55:35.895 --> 01:55:38.597]  I appreciate those important points you made.
[01:55:38.617 --> 01:55:41.099]  And will somebody videotape?
[01:55:41.139 --> 01:55:43.702]  Will somebody record these ads for me, please?
[01:55:44.663 --> 01:55:51.428]  Chances are, if you remember seeing the ad on a certain show you were watching, it's going to air again sometime this week or next week.
[01:55:52.149 --> 01:55:52.930]  Tape it for me.
[01:55:52.990 --> 01:55:53.570]  Send it to me.
[01:55:53.610 --> 01:55:55.372]  Listen, I try to do all this.
[01:55:55.552 --> 01:55:56.473]  I can't do it all.
[01:55:57.495 --> 01:56:01.516]  So much of what we're able to do is because you have gotten involved.
[01:56:01.556 --> 01:56:05.598]  You have helped us get this information together.
[01:56:07.058 --> 01:56:09.399]  Let me just say something about IBM.
[01:56:10.759 --> 01:56:13.580]  People think Microsoft is the big evil company.
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:16.241]  And the evidence is, it really is an NSA front.
[01:56:17.602 --> 01:56:19.222]  Of course, they privately profit themselves.
[01:56:19.242 --> 01:56:20.142]  That's how this works.
[01:56:20.182 --> 01:56:24.724]  They give it to their cronies and they privately profit off the government while it's really part of the government.
[01:56:25.535 --> 01:56:27.836]  And I have this from high-level individuals in the company as well.
[01:56:28.877 --> 01:56:31.678]  IBM makes Microsoft look like a schoolboy.
[01:56:33.158 --> 01:56:39.922]  IBM is the most sinister, evil corporation on the face of the globe right now.
[01:56:41.222 --> 01:56:47.205]  Going back to Thomas Watson and his love of Adolf Hitler and going over to Germany even at the start of the war and the IBM machines.
[01:56:47.425 --> 01:56:49.686]  You know those tattoos on the prison camp victims?
[01:56:51.352 --> 01:56:56.995]  That was your personal ID number entered into the IBM computer with IBM technicians throughout the war serving the Fuhrer.
[01:56:58.276 --> 01:56:59.616]  Now that's public.
[01:57:00.097 --> 01:57:06.160]  And they're at the forefront of running propaganda all over TV and buying up little companies and funding companies.
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:10.262]  There are thousands of companies that are nothing but fronts of IBM.
[01:57:12.263 --> 01:57:14.924]  And it is just unbelievable.
[01:57:17.105 --> 01:57:18.066]  They've always been evil.
[01:57:18.106 --> 01:57:18.866]  They are evil.
[01:57:18.886 --> 01:57:20.027]  That's what IBM is.
[01:57:20.985 --> 01:57:23.626]  And I will not buy or own any IBM equipment.
[01:57:23.987 --> 01:57:24.927]  That is one company.
[01:57:24.947 --> 01:57:27.729]  A lot of them are bad, but you've got to choose your battles.
[01:57:27.769 --> 01:57:30.090]  Do not truck with IBM.
[01:57:34.032 --> 01:57:38.254]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:50.043 --> 01:57:54.246]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:57:54.867 --> 01:57:55.727]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.448 --> 01:57:57.369]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.029 --> 01:58:01.972]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.212 --> 01:58:06.335]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.355 --> 01:58:13.921]  I am sullied.
[01:58:14.741 --> 01:58:17.323]  Suicide before dishonor in occupied Iraq.
[01:58:17.363 --> 01:58:19.265]  I wish he wouldn't have done that.
[01:58:20.524 --> 01:58:24.627]  I cannot support a mission that leads to corruption, human rights abuse, and liars.
[01:58:24.827 --> 01:58:25.528]  I am sullied.
[01:58:25.848 --> 01:58:27.810]  That is soiled, dirtied, corrupted.
[01:58:28.310 --> 01:58:33.374]  I came to serve honorably and feel dishonored death before being dishonored anymore.
[01:58:33.394 --> 01:58:40.400]  And that's what a special forces colonel who then got into investigation said in a suicide note.
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.381]  Maybe you think it's really suicide.
[01:58:42.401 --> 01:58:43.162]  Either way, it's bad.
[01:58:45.202 --> 01:58:46.982]  Now I'm going to get into where the levees bombed.
[01:58:47.243 --> 01:58:49.583]  It's now hitting the Associated Press, MSNBC.
[01:58:50.143 --> 01:58:52.584]  Patriot Act may be renewed without reforms.
[01:58:53.284 --> 01:58:53.504]  U.S.
[01:58:53.524 --> 01:58:57.245]  military continues Iraq propaganda operation despite probe.
[01:58:57.765 --> 01:58:59.266]  We're going to get into that.
[01:59:00.726 --> 01:59:03.187]  Air Marshals put guns to other passengers' heads.
[01:59:05.047 --> 01:59:11.649]  And some of the details begin to emerge of this mentally ill person, this drugged out person, this serotonin reuptake inhibitor victim.
[01:59:12.347 --> 01:59:18.471]  I blame that more than the air marshals of what happened yesterday in Miami, and any of us could be next.
[01:59:19.271 --> 01:59:25.095]  And we'll also get into Village Voice asking what brought down WTC7, and other questions for you.
[01:59:25.695 --> 01:59:33.960]  Four years later, we still have ten big questions, and we'll also get into just a host of other important issues.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.081]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:59:35.381 --> 01:59:37.282]  Tom in Ohio, you're on the air, Tom, go ahead.
[01:59:37.302 --> 01:59:38.903]  Yeah, it's Tom from Ohio, Alex.
[01:59:38.923 --> 01:59:40.784]  I haven't talked to you for a long time.
[01:59:43.018 --> 01:59:45.078]  But, uh, I listen to you all the time.
[01:59:45.799 --> 01:59:48.999]  I'm the one that talked to you a few years ago about Nazi Germany.
[01:59:49.059 --> 01:59:51.940]  A friend of mine was in a Nazi Germany camp.
[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:55.160]  He brought me up to date on everything years ago.
[01:59:55.180 --> 02:00:02.002]  And, uh, right now, uh, uh, I've handed out your movies and handed them out, handed them out.
[02:00:02.802 --> 02:00:06.103]  And one guy at church, I gave him one on 9-11.
[02:00:07.003 --> 02:00:11.024]  And he, uh, he gave it to the fire department next door to him.
[02:00:12.384 --> 02:00:12.584]  And...
[02:00:13.513 --> 02:00:20.359]  You wouldn't believe the police come and visit him and see what he was about.
[02:00:20.979 --> 02:00:25.203]  You know, I need to get people like you, I need to get your name and phone number.
[02:00:25.263 --> 02:00:27.805]  I need to like do a film where I fly to all these towns.
[02:00:27.845 --> 02:00:29.427]  I mean, it's been in the newspaper before.
[02:00:30.548 --> 02:00:36.393]  Kelly Rushing there in Lyon County, Kentucky, no criminal record, upstanding family, businessman.
[02:00:37.242 --> 02:00:41.386]  And he just gave the state police officer a Ron Paul speech and wrote a tyranny.
[02:00:41.926 --> 02:00:44.148]  And they charged him with the Ron Paul speech and the other.
[02:00:44.168 --> 02:00:45.249]  And they said, this is terrorism.
[02:00:45.649 --> 02:00:47.551]  A congressman in the Capitol giving a speech.
[02:00:47.591 --> 02:00:50.293]  They said that particularly was even worse.
[02:00:50.353 --> 02:00:52.595]  And I talked to the judge personally on the phone.
[02:00:52.655 --> 02:00:53.076]  I called him.
[02:00:53.988 --> 02:00:57.931]  They tried to put him in jail for several years, calling it threatening.
[02:00:58.011 --> 02:00:58.391]  Nicely.
[02:00:58.411 --> 02:00:59.892]  Here, officer, you need to know about this.
[02:01:00.233 --> 02:01:01.714]  Ooh, a congressman.
[02:01:01.734 --> 02:01:08.739]  Man, I'm gonna... That's how... Remember the judge who arrested the guy for putting a sign in his yard saying our judicial system is a joke?
[02:01:09.739 --> 02:01:17.705]  You know, just type it into Google, folks, and then the court, and send his deputies out to arrest a prominent member, a big business owner there in that town.
[02:01:18.746 --> 02:01:22.129]  But I get these reports, they are of the minority, but it is happening.
[02:01:22.529 --> 02:01:23.350]  Tell us about this.
[02:01:23.410 --> 02:01:30.295]  Tell me about the evil of what video you gave him, and the evil video he gave the fire department, and why the cops think it's illegal.
[02:01:31.436 --> 02:01:34.858]  Oh, 9-11, they watched it, and they called the police.
[02:01:35.039 --> 02:01:36.079]  They had to call the police.
[02:01:36.119 --> 02:01:39.402]  They come to his apartment and talk to him.
[02:01:40.337 --> 02:01:43.980]  And I think, uh, Undercover Police come there, talk to him.
[02:01:44.900 --> 02:01:48.643]  Never threatened him taking him to jail or anything for, well, what he's told me.
[02:01:48.663 --> 02:01:55.647]  Then, uh, then he was, uh, watched for about a month by Undercover Police.
[02:01:56.388 --> 02:01:56.788]  Okay.
[02:01:57.649 --> 02:01:58.989]  Then he's not watched anymore.
[02:01:59.950 --> 02:02:02.492]  But I think he, uh, had problems.
[02:02:02.692 --> 02:02:06.715]  Now, uh, he worked for Jeep up in Toledo.
[02:02:07.515 --> 02:02:08.716]  I think, uh,
[02:02:09.625 --> 02:02:22.894]  The way it looks, Ali, I'm not sure on this, and he's not sure for sure either, but they put, they worked him over, they put him like, uh, let me tell you something, stay there, I'll come back to you, let me tell you something.
[02:02:23.815 --> 02:02:26.337]  They're trying to create a chilling effect because they're panicking.
[02:02:26.357 --> 02:02:28.238]  The criminals are losing control.
[02:02:28.738 --> 02:02:35.403]  You know, the Founding Fathers went through a lot economically for what they did, but in the end, it was the Redcoats that had to go back to England.
[02:02:36.635 --> 02:02:40.906]  And it's like the head of the cable and internet company in Knoxville.
[02:02:41.127 --> 02:02:42.310]  I mean, he was a big exec.
[02:02:42.751 --> 02:02:44.556]  Fired because he believes in the New World Order.
[02:02:44.616 --> 02:02:44.917]  Stay there.
[02:02:46.866 --> 02:02:49.728]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.988 --> 02:02:51.569]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.910 --> 02:02:56.573]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.913 --> 02:03:01.337]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.777 --> 02:03:05.980]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:06.180 --> 02:03:09.002]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.122 --> 02:03:11.624]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks,
[02:03:11.804 --> 02:03:13.766]  But the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.966 --> 02:03:18.350]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.610 --> 02:03:25.836]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:26.076 --> 02:03:28.518]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.678 --> 02:03:30.400]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:46.616 --> 02:03:49.620]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:49.961 --> 02:03:58.772]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:59.113 --> 02:04:03.779]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:04.239 --> 02:04:10.963]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:11.364 --> 02:04:23.131]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:23.611 --> 02:04:28.075]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:04:28.255 --> 02:04:30.717]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:30.737 --> 02:04:32.559]  And call them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:04:35.321 --> 02:04:36.382]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:47.006 --> 02:04:48.608]  Government is best what governs least.
[02:04:49.149 --> 02:04:50.471]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:04:50.911 --> 02:04:53.615]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:04:54.055 --> 02:04:56.699]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:04:57.159 --> 02:05:03.608]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:05:26.066 --> 02:05:26.407]  Have you?
[02:05:26.987 --> 02:05:28.489]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[02:05:32.713 --> 02:05:36.718]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:05:37.178 --> 02:05:38.239]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:05:38.800 --> 02:05:39.961]  Osama Bin Forgotten.

[02:05:46.963 --> 02:05:52.988]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.588 --> 02:05:56.631]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.952 --> 02:06:02.135]  I could do a whole radio broadcast on this, but I really do want to get back into the news.
[02:06:02.155 --> 02:06:05.158]  There's so many headlines, so much to talk about, so much going on.
[02:06:05.838 --> 02:06:08.400]  Really important information coming up, so please stay with us.
[02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:15.326]  And I'm going to cover that here in just a few minutes after we finish up this caller and one other item.
[02:06:17.017 --> 02:06:30.243]  But it was in the local paper in Lyon County, Kentucky, just reporting on it like they were reporting on the price of cattle, or the price of eggs down at the supermarket.
[02:06:31.024 --> 02:06:36.366]  Local Kelly Rushing, a member of the community, no criminal record, living at such and such address.
[02:06:37.147 --> 02:06:39.888]  His family's big in the community, just a nice Christian family.
[02:06:40.208 --> 02:06:41.689]  He's a middle-aged man, owns a business.
[02:06:42.700 --> 02:06:55.527]  He gave a videotape of a congressman giving a speech in another film by Alex Jones to the local state police officer and he has been arrested and is being charged with a terroristic threat against the officer.
[02:06:56.267 --> 02:07:00.249]  And they took him into court and they told the jury this video is threatening and anti-law enforcement.
[02:07:00.829 --> 02:07:03.631]  We want you to give him two years per account each video.
[02:07:04.466 --> 02:07:06.407]  And the jury just said, are you crazy?
[02:07:06.827 --> 02:07:08.567]  But I mean, I talked to the judge on the phone.
[02:07:08.607 --> 02:07:11.568]  I called him up at home and was polite to him and I said, what's wrong with you?
[02:07:11.588 --> 02:07:12.468]  This is America.
[02:07:12.488 --> 02:07:17.890]  He goes, I'm not going to talk about the case, but these videos are in a dialogue board, man.
[02:07:18.150 --> 02:07:19.931]  I mean, what is wrong with you?
[02:07:20.451 --> 02:07:22.612]  You people are the sickest scum on earth.
[02:07:22.812 --> 02:07:24.652]  This is America, you scum!
[02:07:25.712 --> 02:07:29.774]  The congressman's video on the floor of the House in the Capitol.
[02:07:29.794 --> 02:07:30.634]  Have you heard of it?
[02:07:33.168 --> 02:07:38.930]  Folks, if I wrote satire about a ridiculous police state, it wouldn't be this ridiculous.
[02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:40.970]  It's so insane!
[02:07:40.990 --> 02:07:42.870]  And I get these reports every few weeks.
[02:07:42.910 --> 02:07:44.351]  Again, it's the minority of people.
[02:07:45.251 --> 02:07:54.433]  Why do you think the AP and all these big newspapers and CNN was reporting, oh, the head of the major cable company in Knoxville, Tennessee, also ran the big internet company?
[02:07:55.254 --> 02:08:04.480]  He believed that the government could have been involved in 9-11, and obviously we're on in Knoxville, we're busy getting him on.
[02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:07.082]  I bet you my bottom dollar he's a listener, because we're on there.
[02:08:07.282 --> 02:08:09.283]  WBCR goes into Knoxville, it's outside Knoxville.
[02:08:10.324 --> 02:08:19.590]  And he said this, he's a successful executive, sterling record in the community, and boom, they said, you're fired buddy, we're not going to have that.
[02:08:21.866 --> 02:08:36.670]  There have been at least seven cases of people I know personally who worked for Dell Computers for years and did absolutely nothing wrong, and you're allowed to go on the internet during lunch and things like that.
[02:08:36.710 --> 02:08:43.673]  You cannot visit porn, hate, gambling, and what was the fourth thing?
[02:08:43.693 --> 02:08:44.633]  There's four categories.
[02:08:44.713 --> 02:08:48.414]  Porn, hate, gambling, and hacking.
[02:08:49.674 --> 02:08:51.515]  Infowars.com and Prison Planet
[02:08:52.182 --> 02:08:56.064]  But the cases I've all heard of are in the hate category.
[02:08:57.144 --> 02:08:58.925]  Where you'll read MSNBC.
[02:09:00.025 --> 02:09:01.686]  And where you'll read the Associated Press.
[02:09:01.706 --> 02:09:03.307]  And where you'll read BBC, mainly.
[02:09:03.587 --> 02:09:05.908]  And our own articles are all backed up and documented.
[02:09:06.328 --> 02:09:06.708]  Totally.
[02:09:06.768 --> 02:09:07.488]  I mean, neurotically.
[02:09:07.528 --> 02:09:10.890]  Mainstream news articles don't have hyperlinks every other word like we do.
[02:09:10.930 --> 02:09:13.911]  That's just a new standard in journalism.
[02:09:17.353 --> 02:09:20.454]  Now, so I'm sitting here
[02:09:21.309 --> 02:09:29.516]  Dealing with this, and I know people, I mean, I have friends who they get called in, you've worked here six years, well, you violated our policy visiting hate sites.
[02:09:29.536 --> 02:09:29.917]  What do you mean?
[02:09:30.357 --> 02:09:32.239]  We consider InfoWars.com a hate site.
[02:09:32.759 --> 02:09:34.121]  Get your stuff and get out.
[02:09:34.201 --> 02:09:35.922]  Security will escort you out of the building.
[02:09:36.843 --> 02:09:44.530]  I mean, the second you visit InfoWars.com, and now I'm reading articles about where companies are snooping on what their employees visit when they're at home.
[02:09:46.196 --> 02:09:51.080]  Oh, and we caught the police captain smoking a cigar at a party, and we have a policy against smoking.
[02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:52.100]  You're fired, too, for that.
[02:09:52.141 --> 02:09:53.481]  See, it's everybody.
[02:09:53.522 --> 02:09:55.523]  This is economic terrorism.
[02:09:55.543 --> 02:09:56.524]  This is America.
[02:09:56.784 --> 02:09:57.925]  You people are the traitors.
[02:09:58.145 --> 02:09:59.566]  You're the ones that ought to be arrested.
[02:09:59.786 --> 02:10:00.827]  I'm serious, folks.
[02:10:00.847 --> 02:10:02.908]  You know, you can have a policy and a job.
[02:10:02.988 --> 02:10:03.289]  Fine.
[02:10:03.329 --> 02:10:04.169]  That's police state.
[02:10:04.429 --> 02:10:05.410]  We boycott Dell.
[02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:07.752]  Remember the gun company called up to buy guns?
[02:10:08.873 --> 02:10:10.554]  I mean, to buy a computer for their gun company?
[02:10:10.834 --> 02:10:12.855]  And they said, it has the word gun in your company, sorry!
[02:10:13.035 --> 02:10:14.956]  And we're reporting you, we're not selling you computers.
[02:10:15.416 --> 02:10:15.897]  Guns!
[02:10:16.097 --> 02:10:17.037]  Guns are illegal!
[02:10:17.077 --> 02:10:17.517]  Guns!
[02:10:17.598 --> 02:10:18.078]  Guns!
[02:10:18.378 --> 02:10:18.898]  Remember that?
[02:10:19.879 --> 02:10:21.099]  Combat arms, wasn't it?
[02:10:24.681 --> 02:10:28.683]  So, so, we're about to go back and let Tom finish up very quickly here.
[02:10:29.824 --> 02:10:31.024]  Folks, this is not a joke.
[02:10:31.064 --> 02:10:32.045]  This is not a game.
[02:10:32.125 --> 02:10:34.726]  This is really happening.
[02:10:36.145 --> 02:10:39.026]  And if you're buffaloed by it, I mean, this is classical tyranny.
[02:10:39.466 --> 02:10:44.747]  If you let them, if you're afraid, I might get... Now, of course, a lot of places you'll get a job because you're anti-New World Order.
[02:10:45.707 --> 02:10:50.709]  A lot of places, you know, the police will call you in and go, Officer, I hear you're about the New World Order.
[02:10:50.729 --> 02:10:53.169]  Well, so am I. I come to a meeting at my house on Sunday.
[02:10:53.469 --> 02:10:55.550]  I mean, that's actually getting more common than not.
[02:10:55.770 --> 02:10:59.711]  People are... See, this stuff's gotten so extreme that a lot of people, they didn't believe us.
[02:11:00.936 --> 02:11:02.117]  Are now joining our team.
[02:11:02.157 --> 02:11:03.758]  I mean, because it's real, folks!
[02:11:04.398 --> 02:11:05.619]  They had some cop show.
[02:11:05.659 --> 02:11:06.500]  It's a regional show.
[02:11:06.540 --> 02:11:07.560]  It's not these show cops.
[02:11:07.620 --> 02:11:08.841]  I've got it somewhere.
[02:11:09.461 --> 02:11:17.766]  Where they pull the guy over and he's got my videos and they take him to jail for some other reason and make a big deal about my videos on TV.
[02:11:18.927 --> 02:11:20.628]  We've confirmed that on military basis.
[02:11:20.688 --> 02:11:21.609]  I knew this years ago.
[02:11:21.649 --> 02:11:23.030]  They catch you with my videotapes.
[02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:24.190]  They'll kick you out.
[02:11:24.230 --> 02:11:26.712]  They'll run you till you throw up if you're lucky.
[02:11:27.595 --> 02:11:30.177]  Oh my gosh, we've got an Alex Jones video!
[02:11:30.457 --> 02:11:32.319]  And this isn't some big plug for my videos.
[02:11:32.659 --> 02:11:33.780]  This is really happening.
[02:11:33.860 --> 02:11:35.101]  Why my videos?
[02:11:35.461 --> 02:11:36.442]  Because they're effective.
[02:11:36.482 --> 02:11:37.062]  They're true.
[02:11:37.362 --> 02:11:39.304]  I don't claim they want to put microchips in you.
[02:11:39.564 --> 02:11:47.490]  I show the federal documents and Pentagon plan, and then I show a bunch of people like Sean Hannity and Andy Rooney saying we all need to be made to take them.
[02:11:47.770 --> 02:11:48.630]  I'm not saying that.
[02:11:48.750 --> 02:11:49.311]  They are!
[02:11:50.815 --> 02:11:55.699]  I don't claim FEMA says all Christians are terrorists and America's bad and the Founding Fathers are evil.
[02:11:56.139 --> 02:12:00.943]  I have actual video of them in front of a huge group of police teaching them this, you see.
[02:12:01.203 --> 02:12:04.205]  You see, we have you, true traitor, criminal scum.
[02:12:04.345 --> 02:12:05.066]  We have you.
[02:12:05.086 --> 02:12:06.027]  Do you understand?
[02:12:06.087 --> 02:12:07.127]  You can't stop us.
[02:12:07.388 --> 02:12:17.095]  You scum bags that want to destroy this country and you're not going to get away with it because there's a lot of us that aren't afraid of you and we know what you are and we're going to expose you!
[02:12:18.226 --> 02:12:19.527]  Alright, I'm getting really mad.
[02:12:20.008 --> 02:12:25.894]  This is America arresting people for giving out Ron Paul speeches!
[02:12:27.555 --> 02:12:29.738]  The famous neocon speech.
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:36.905]  Where he laid out their own books they've written where they say they want to destroy America.
[02:12:38.297 --> 02:12:50.412]  And that stupid state police officer sat there and watched a veteran, a doctor, an American, a congressman with a sterling voting record read out of their own publications where they said they're going to destroy this country.
[02:12:51.380 --> 02:13:01.466]  And that freaked that cop out so much, that upset him so much, that he decided to go arrest an American and become what was in that video.
[02:13:01.726 --> 02:13:03.207]  Become what we're talking about.
[02:13:03.447 --> 02:13:06.709]  Become the scum of the earth.
[02:13:07.489 --> 02:13:09.250]  Absolute filth.
[02:13:10.071 --> 02:13:11.892]  Absolute trash.
[02:13:12.712 --> 02:13:15.954]  I gotta go to this important item here.
[02:13:17.197 --> 02:13:18.478]  Last caller for a while here.
[02:13:19.118 --> 02:13:22.860]  Tom, finish up your point about your friend who gave it to the... Oh, let me tell you what happened here.
[02:13:23.060 --> 02:13:25.521]  The fire departments all fight over my videos in Austin.
[02:13:25.541 --> 02:13:26.662]  See, they don't have them all.
[02:13:27.062 --> 02:13:28.142]  And I say keep doing it.
[02:13:28.182 --> 02:13:29.703]  Keep arresting people for videos.
[02:13:29.923 --> 02:13:30.624]  Keep it going.
[02:13:30.924 --> 02:13:31.864]  Just keep doing it.
[02:13:32.464 --> 02:13:36.726]  Keep arresting people who put a sign saying our judicial system's a joke, because it is.
[02:13:37.607 --> 02:13:38.527]  Just keep doing it.
[02:13:38.567 --> 02:13:40.408]  Just keep showing us what you are.
[02:13:41.149 --> 02:13:42.009]  You're going down.
[02:13:42.429 --> 02:13:42.789]  I'm sorry.
[02:13:42.829 --> 02:13:43.650]  Tom, go ahead and finish up.
[02:13:43.670 --> 02:13:46.151]  Hey, uh, this guy ain't working yet.
[02:13:47.301 --> 02:13:52.126]  They took him out of his job and probably because they think he's a nutcase.
[02:13:52.726 --> 02:13:53.687]  Oh, that's the thing.
[02:13:54.849 --> 02:13:57.091]  We're nuts because we can read federal documents.
[02:13:57.791 --> 02:14:04.678]  Oh, and I gave him different officers and one day I was going to give another one to this officer and he wouldn't take it.
[02:14:04.698 --> 02:14:05.799]  He said, I can't take them.
[02:14:06.140 --> 02:14:09.964]  What specific video was it that you gave your friend that freaked him out so much?
[02:14:09.984 --> 02:14:10.044]  A 9-11.
[02:14:13.581 --> 02:14:14.762]  That was for the fire department.
[02:14:15.282 --> 02:14:15.862]  No, boy.
[02:14:16.182 --> 02:14:24.407]  And so I upset them to see firefighter engineering publication saying that it had to be controlled demolition, I guess.
[02:14:24.807 --> 02:14:28.749]  And I guarantee you that magazine was on the shelf there, but those guys don't even read it.
[02:14:29.149 --> 02:14:31.410]  Why don't they call the police on firefighter engineering?
[02:14:31.570 --> 02:14:32.471]  Here, go arrest them!
[02:14:32.571 --> 02:14:33.191]  Fire them!
[02:14:33.211 --> 02:14:33.892]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:34.312 --> 02:14:34.652]  Oh, hey.
[02:14:34.932 --> 02:14:35.913]  Yeah, real fast, sir.
[02:14:36.053 --> 02:14:37.454]  Hey, we have
[02:14:38.474 --> 02:14:43.255]  I can't put up this summer around me about 50 miles.
[02:14:43.275 --> 02:14:47.056]  It's done and they haven't used that station.
[02:14:47.076 --> 02:14:48.636]  Send me some info.
[02:14:48.656 --> 02:14:49.196]  I've got to jump.
[02:14:49.236 --> 02:14:49.936]  I've got to jump, sir.
[02:14:49.956 --> 02:14:50.276]  Thank you.
[02:14:51.076 --> 02:14:51.877]  I've got a ton of news.
[02:14:51.937 --> 02:14:56.877]  In fact, I'll be lucky if I can even go to Ian and Wolfgang and Daryl and a few others.
[02:14:56.937 --> 02:14:58.638]  I've got to cover news first.
[02:14:58.658 --> 02:15:05.059]  But right now, I ask him in here because Gold... Ted gave me a deal last week to offer the listeners.
[02:15:06.050 --> 02:15:08.271]  That was still the deal from three weeks before that.
[02:15:08.812 --> 02:15:10.413]  The price now, I guess, of a month ago.
[02:15:11.573 --> 02:15:12.434]  Of gold.
[02:15:13.294 --> 02:15:15.156]  And it's now gone up even more.
[02:15:15.976 --> 02:15:16.957]  Well over 500.
[02:15:17.817 --> 02:15:19.438]  And these are going to be gone soon.
[02:15:20.579 --> 02:15:25.662]  They're in-house there at Miner's Resources, the owner of Genesis, the GCN radio network.
[02:15:26.691 --> 02:15:36.078]  And when they're gone, they're gone, and I am taking any discretionary income I've got, non-discretionary, and I just bought more gold, a few more pieces.
[02:15:36.798 --> 02:15:45.724]  Every time I can, because the gold I bought four or five years ago has doubled, doubled now in value, and the stock market is down many, many points.
[02:15:46.164 --> 02:15:48.746]  What they do is they take the losers out of the Dow and the Nasdaq.
[02:15:49.026 --> 02:15:50.127]  It's total smoke and mirrors.
[02:15:50.647 --> 02:15:55.171]  The economy is in deep, deep trouble, but even with them monkeying with it, it's down.
[02:15:56.397 --> 02:15:57.678]  Even with Cook Berkshire down.
[02:15:58.278 --> 02:15:59.499]  Ted, tell them about the deal you got.
[02:15:59.519 --> 02:16:03.121]  I'll have to hold you over because my ranting went over.
[02:16:03.221 --> 02:16:04.382]  Tell us about the new deal, Ted.
[02:16:04.422 --> 02:16:05.562]  Well, here's what the thing is.
[02:16:05.703 --> 02:16:07.604]  First of all, gold right now is at $520.
[02:16:08.284 --> 02:16:10.105]  So that's a huge increase.
[02:16:10.706 --> 02:16:13.107]  The next resistance level is around $540.
[02:16:13.687 --> 02:16:15.228]  This is really ridiculous.
[02:16:15.809 --> 02:16:16.429]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:16:16.469 --> 02:16:17.630]  I put together that deal for you.
[02:16:17.650 --> 02:16:18.590]  I asked you to talk about it.
[02:16:18.630 --> 02:16:19.911]  We didn't get a chance to do it.
[02:16:19.931 --> 02:16:21.552]  We're going to do it at the same price.
[02:16:21.612 --> 02:16:23.333]  It's $10 gold pieces at $364 per coin.
[02:16:25.609 --> 02:16:29.374]  I know that the $10 Liberty has already gone up about $10.
[02:16:29.494 --> 02:16:33.619]  They sold for what, around $7.50 in the 80s?
[02:16:33.819 --> 02:16:34.460]  Yep, they did.
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:40.648]  As a matter of fact, gold was less expensive today than it was then, and they were trading for that price back then.
[02:16:44.784 --> 02:16:50.069]  Roughly about maybe 200,000 coins available for people to be bought, and then there's none to go around.
[02:16:50.209 --> 02:16:51.090]  After that, zero.
[02:16:51.430 --> 02:16:56.055]  People are buying these coins, they're putting them away, hoarding them, whatever you want to call it.
[02:16:56.075 --> 02:17:04.463]  Bottom line, you're getting them at near bullion melt prices with a collectible value added, so it means it's non-reported, and it's non-compensatable.
[02:17:04.763 --> 02:17:06.845]  I think people should have a second option, too, here, though.
[02:17:07.671 --> 02:17:12.355]  I put together a group of silver dollars, and we all know what silver is doing right now.
[02:17:12.455 --> 02:17:14.577]  It's practically $9 an ounce.
[02:17:14.597 --> 02:17:17.720]  Right now it's $8.91.
[02:17:17.760 --> 02:17:19.121]  That's up a couple bucks, isn't it?
[02:17:19.281 --> 02:17:19.822]  Yeah, it is.
[02:17:19.842 --> 02:17:20.703]  Do you want to go over this?
[02:17:20.823 --> 02:17:21.884]  Of course we have to.
[02:17:21.904 --> 02:17:23.365]  Yeah, I got frothing.
[02:17:23.405 --> 02:17:25.247]  I've only been holding for 15 minutes.
[02:17:25.447 --> 02:17:25.887]  Boss!
[02:17:27.128 --> 02:17:29.410]  But I drug him in here because
[02:17:31.121 --> 02:17:32.403]  I buy gold from the sky.
[02:17:32.423 --> 02:17:34.025]  I buy water filters from our sponsors.
[02:17:34.185 --> 02:17:37.188]  I don't... I don't push the magic junk on you folks.
[02:17:37.228 --> 02:17:38.330]  I just... real stuff.
[02:17:38.950 --> 02:17:42.074]  You know, I believe in guns, gold, and God.
[02:17:42.114 --> 02:17:42.815]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.914 --> 02:17:46.695]  Attention Drivers!
[02:17:47.015 --> 02:17:49.536]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[02:17:49.857 --> 02:17:53.139]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[02:17:53.479 --> 02:17:58.342]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents and fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[02:17:58.702 --> 02:18:02.365]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits buildup in your car's combustion chambers.
[02:18:02.785 --> 02:18:03.846]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[02:18:04.146 --> 02:18:07.147]  Poor mileage and reduced performance in a time of record fuel prices.
[02:18:07.447 --> 02:18:08.108]  There is an answer.
[02:18:08.368 --> 02:18:14.511]  Protekta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.
[02:18:14.751 --> 02:18:21.835]  Plus, a special mileage improver designed and fleet tested by a major oil company to improve mileage even on new cars by up to 4%.
[02:18:22.155 --> 02:18:24.396]  The mileage improvement lasts for an entire oil change.
[02:18:24.676 --> 02:18:28.718]  So quit wasting unburned fuel and get more when you treat your car right with Protekta.
[02:18:29.119 --> 02:18:30.679]  Go to www.sfr.com.

[02:18:46.653 --> 02:18:55.718]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:18:55.958 --> 02:19:07.204]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:19:07.524 --> 02:19:13.247]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:19:13.487 --> 02:19:20.149]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[02:19:20.349 --> 02:19:27.171]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:19:27.451 --> 02:19:29.212]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[02:19:29.472 --> 02:19:31.532]  Upgrade to Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:19:31.752 --> 02:19:33.833]  Get a two-pack for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175.
[02:19:33.873 --> 02:19:34.773]  Call New Millennium at 888-

[02:19:40.435 --> 02:19:42.436]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:19:42.476 --> 02:19:55.120]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24th, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:20:05.034 --> 02:20:08.156]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:20:08.416 --> 02:20:10.257]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:20:10.337 --> 02:20:13.338]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:13.879 --> 02:20:16.100]  Here is reality.
[02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:20.062]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:20:20.542 --> 02:20:24.204]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:20:24.764 --> 02:20:27.265]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.

[02:20:46.011 --> 02:20:48.533]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:20:49.074 --> 02:20:54.378]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[02:20:55.058 --> 02:21:01.243]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[02:21:01.884 --> 02:21:04.726]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:21:05.326 --> 02:21:16.576]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:21:46.548 --> 02:21:51.693]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.374 --> 02:21:54.756]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:58.860 --> 02:22:01.342]  Folks, I hate to toot our horn here.
[02:22:02.523 --> 02:22:04.005]  What have we not been right about?
[02:22:04.946 --> 02:22:10.491]  Now, I've been saying for the last six, seven years that I've been pushing gold,
[02:22:12.285 --> 02:22:16.288]  And if I talk the talk, folks, I walk the walk, that I don't care if it goes up.
[02:22:16.709 --> 02:22:20.211]  It at least has more intrinsic value than a fiat dollar.
[02:22:21.853 --> 02:22:29.759]  And all the trends show that when the Euro emerged and all this happened over time, that the dollar is only going to go down and the gold is only going to go up.
[02:22:30.600 --> 02:22:32.641]  And so my investment has doubled.
[02:22:32.781 --> 02:22:34.103]  And it's a small investment.
[02:22:34.143 --> 02:22:35.203]  I mean, I haven't bought a lot of gold.
[02:22:35.223 --> 02:22:36.404]  A few coins here, a few coins there.
[02:22:36.705 --> 02:22:39.167]  Over time that builds up into a nice little pile, but it's not that much.
[02:22:40.487 --> 02:22:42.748]  I guess it's double what it would have been.
[02:22:43.068 --> 02:22:44.148]  This is what we're talking about.
[02:22:44.208 --> 02:22:45.609]  Ted, give them the specials.
[02:22:46.289 --> 02:22:49.910]  It looks like it's even going to go up more from here, but that doesn't frankly matter to me.
[02:22:50.650 --> 02:22:55.592]  I just bought a few more coins from you the other day because I know this is gold.
[02:22:55.672 --> 02:23:01.253]  This is something that's going to be good, even if an asteroid hits the world and we go back to caveman time.
[02:23:01.554 --> 02:23:02.694]  Well, that's exactly right.
[02:23:02.734 --> 02:23:09.316]  Gold is way better than paper currency, especially considering the fact that the paper currency is nothing but a mirror of the United States' debt.
[02:23:09.924 --> 02:23:11.886]  But here's what I was offering.
[02:23:11.966 --> 02:23:14.067]  Silver was what?
[02:23:14.087 --> 02:23:16.509]  $7.60 an ounce roughly trading there.
[02:23:17.010 --> 02:23:18.571]  Silver dollars haven't moved yet Alex.
[02:23:18.611 --> 02:23:19.772]  We haven't even focused on them.
[02:23:19.792 --> 02:23:21.713]  I don't know why anybody hasn't mentioned this.
[02:23:22.234 --> 02:23:23.875]  They're currently right now at $12.75 a piece.
[02:23:23.895 --> 02:23:25.817]  They were $12.75 a piece then and they still are today.
[02:23:30.300 --> 02:23:37.345]  Currently right now silver however is almost at nine dollars an ounce almost a dollar and a half higher than where they were before.
[02:23:37.766 --> 02:23:43.170]  The silver dollars are obviously something that is very short supply and very high demand.
[02:23:44.251 --> 02:23:48.534]  You go to eBay and try to buy silver dollars you'll be paying fifteen to twenty dollars a piece for them.
[02:23:49.074 --> 02:23:51.496]  I've got them by the bag right now at $12.75 a coin.
[02:23:51.656 --> 02:23:54.918]  By the way, Ted, you've said that before.
[02:23:54.958 --> 02:23:56.779]  My wife's a big eBay fan.
[02:23:57.160 --> 02:23:57.800]  She went and looked.
[02:23:57.920 --> 02:23:59.781]  They were selling $18.20 a piece.
[02:23:59.961 --> 02:24:01.442]  Yeah, that's exactly what I mean.
[02:24:02.363 --> 02:24:07.447]  People can buy them by the bag from me and sell them by the coin on eBay and pick up a profit right away.
[02:24:07.807 --> 02:24:08.888]  But this is the thing.
[02:24:08.948 --> 02:24:10.889]  Right now you have the $10 gold pieces.
[02:24:10.929 --> 02:24:12.730]  They're trading at $3.64 a piece.
[02:24:12.770 --> 02:24:14.171]  The silver dollars are at $12.75.
[02:24:16.204 --> 02:24:22.028]  It's kind of a secret about the silver dollars, because they're going to go up as soon as the supplies, you know, people start buying those, boom, they go up in price.
[02:24:22.448 --> 02:24:23.829]  So, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:24:24.470 --> 02:24:29.353]  If you'd like to have the gold, go with the gold $10 gold piece.
[02:24:29.393 --> 02:24:32.155]  If you'd like to get involved with the silver, just think about it.
[02:24:32.195 --> 02:24:36.738]  If you put a silver dollar, and these are the silver dollars that were minted back at the turn of the century.
[02:24:36.758 --> 02:24:37.678]  They're a great Christmas gift.
[02:24:38.739 --> 02:24:42.722]  Put one in your kid's hand, in your relative's hand, in anybody you know.
[02:24:43.082 --> 02:24:44.323]  They know they have value there.
[02:24:44.363 --> 02:24:45.984]  There's absolutely no question.
[02:24:46.084 --> 02:25:01.119]  I'm going to throw another deal at them out of here, but we still have the citizen rule book deal where you get a silver dollar and two citizen rule books, the Bill of Rights, Constitution, what juries and grand juries mean, what America is really all about, power-packed books, what is it, $24.95?
[02:25:01.200 --> 02:25:01.980]  People get those too?
[02:25:02.100 --> 02:25:07.146]  Yeah, and that's exactly the same price as it was back when silver was at, what, $5 an ounce here, $3 an ounce?
[02:25:08.787 --> 02:25:10.608]  About three, four years ago.
[02:25:10.668 --> 02:25:11.689]  We haven't changed that either.
[02:25:11.969 --> 02:25:13.550]  A really good opportunity, Alex.
[02:25:13.911 --> 02:25:18.134]  But once again, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:25:18.374 --> 02:25:19.815]  Ask for the silver dollars.
[02:25:20.335 --> 02:25:21.816]  Ask for the $10 gold pieces.
[02:25:21.836 --> 02:25:22.837]  You just can't go wrong.
[02:25:23.077 --> 02:25:28.080]  Right now, we're looking at gold at $5.20, silver's at $8.91 an ounce.
[02:25:28.541 --> 02:25:34.965]  Things are happening in this market, and obviously... Well, Chad, for those who don't understand, you've got coins locked in for a month.
[02:25:35.783 --> 02:25:37.524]  Still selling them at that price.
[02:25:37.744 --> 02:25:39.124]  And believe me, I shop around, folks.
[02:25:39.164 --> 02:25:43.165]  I get them from Ted because it's on the low end, cost-wise.
[02:25:43.485 --> 02:25:44.846]  It's a free country, free market.
[02:25:45.066 --> 02:25:50.267]  There's a small amount of market there for the people to take your order and, you know, to keep the lights on here at the network.
[02:25:50.307 --> 02:25:53.208]  This is a holding of Midas Resources.
[02:25:53.748 --> 02:25:56.069]  But it is a smart thing to do.
[02:25:56.489 --> 02:25:58.469]  These are good coins to have.
[02:25:58.489 --> 02:26:03.511]  I personally just bought some of these very coins.
[02:26:04.151 --> 02:26:04.391]  It's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:26:04.411 --> 02:26:06.253]  Mention that you heard it on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:06.273 --> 02:26:07.214]  We'll get them right out to you.
[02:26:07.234 --> 02:26:14.099]  We really appreciate you listening and we appreciate your support and all of the business that you've already done with Midas Resources.
[02:26:30.212 --> 02:26:32.294]  What do you sell most by the bag or the roll?
[02:26:32.354 --> 02:26:33.795]  You can pick them up by the roll of 20.
[02:26:53.440 --> 02:26:55.381]  Like I said, they're $12.75 a piece.
[02:26:55.401 --> 02:26:56.102]  A bag is $1,000.
[02:26:56.162 --> 02:26:59.204]  A lot of people pick up the bags, too, but you have to have $12,000.
[02:26:59.364 --> 02:27:02.206]  Are you breaking them down if somebody just wants to buy five for their kids?
[02:27:02.286 --> 02:27:02.946]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:27:03.346 --> 02:27:04.267]  You can pick them up that way.
[02:27:04.287 --> 02:27:05.088]  You can pick them up that way.
[02:27:05.108 --> 02:27:05.748]  I might give that as a gift.
[02:27:05.788 --> 02:27:08.510]  I was just thinking about... Better not say too much.
[02:27:08.570 --> 02:27:10.231]  People are listening to what they're getting for Christmas.
[02:27:11.432 --> 02:27:13.073]  Alright, Ted.
[02:27:13.113 --> 02:27:14.974]  Thanks a lot for coming on.
[02:27:14.994 --> 02:27:16.795]  1-800-686-2237.
[02:27:17.615 --> 02:27:18.316]  I believe in this.
[02:27:18.336 --> 02:27:19.697]  I mean, I never changed what I said.
[02:27:19.757 --> 02:27:21.338]  I've been saying this for six years.
[02:27:22.333 --> 02:27:23.214]  My money's doubled.
[02:27:23.254 --> 02:27:24.194]  What about yours?
[02:27:24.214 --> 02:27:24.254]  800-686-2237.
[02:27:24.415 --> 02:27:28.518]  They're saying it could hit 800 an ounce.
[02:27:29.318 --> 02:27:30.299]  I don't care if it goes down.
[02:27:30.319 --> 02:27:31.480]  I'm still going to be buying.
[02:27:32.080 --> 02:27:32.781]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:33.001 --> 02:27:33.721]  Blitz the news.
[02:27:33.801 --> 02:27:34.542]  Blitz the news.
[02:27:34.562 --> 02:27:35.322]  Blitz the news.
[02:27:36.203 --> 02:27:37.124]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.584 --> 02:27:39.205]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.106 --> 02:27:42.788]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.258 --> 02:27:48.620]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:48.880 --> 02:27:52.723]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:27:53.043 --> 02:27:53.864]  Read the labels.
[02:27:54.284 --> 02:27:58.427]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:58.627 --> 02:28:02.810]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:08.074]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:28:08.434 --> 02:28:12.016]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:28:12.216 --> 02:28:17.559]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:28:17.839 --> 02:28:20.560]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:28:20.861 --> 02:28:21.761]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:28:22.061 --> 02:28:32.787]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.

[02:28:45.743 --> 02:28:47.704]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:28:47.784 --> 02:28:58.509]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:28:58.869 --> 02:29:03.391]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:29:03.471 --> 02:29:14.797]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:29:15.397 --> 02:29:22.240]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:24.761]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:29:25.262 --> 02:29:30.224]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.

[02:29:42.092 --> 02:29:42.132]  888-803-4438.
[02:29:46.454 --> 02:29:51.096]  According to the American Diabetes Association, more than 18 million people in the U.S.
[02:29:51.136 --> 02:29:51.877]  have diabetes.
[02:29:52.197 --> 02:29:59.141]  Most people with diabetes have risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and cholesterol, which increase their risk for heart disease.
[02:29:59.301 --> 02:30:03.823]  For example, more than 65% of people with diabetes die from heart disease or stroke.
[02:30:04.023 --> 02:30:06.845]  Finding out you or your loved ones have diabetes can be scary.
[02:30:06.985 --> 02:30:11.487]  This is why, as your trusted online partner in health, we are committed to bringing you products
[02:30:11.727 --> 02:30:12.248]  We're good to go!

[02:30:38.610 --> 02:30:39.091]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[02:30:39.111 --> 02:30:41.552]  You know, I got real mad a few segments ago.
[02:30:41.632 --> 02:30:46.794]  I'm going to cover the news here in a second.
[02:30:46.934 --> 02:30:50.276]  I've just got to say this.
[02:30:50.316 --> 02:30:53.357]  The Kelly-Rushing situation, that's one of many
[02:31:02.975 --> 02:31:14.665]  And you might not want to believe me that a guy put a little sign in his yard saying our judicial system is a joke, and so a local judge saw it, was offended, and didn't even have his name on it, by the way, and had him arrested.
[02:31:14.685 --> 02:31:17.347]  Of course, then the judge got in a bunch of trouble, because people still knew.
[02:31:17.367 --> 02:31:18.348]  This is America, buddy!
[02:31:18.368 --> 02:31:19.048]  Are you crazy?
[02:31:19.068 --> 02:31:20.590]  This is out in the country.
[02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:26.314]  Well, with Kelly Rushing, I mean, I even got some of the minutes of the trial.
[02:31:26.695 --> 02:31:27.616]  I talked to the judge.
[02:31:27.636 --> 02:31:30.218]  They were actually, they weren't saying he threatened
[02:31:31.170 --> 02:31:32.371]  You know, the cop in some other way.
[02:31:32.391 --> 02:31:37.013]  They were saying, these videos are anti-law enforcement, anti-cop, and that's threatening to the officer.
[02:31:37.033 --> 02:31:41.676]  That's like saying, I don't agree with your view on, you know, what color to paint your car.
[02:31:41.716 --> 02:31:42.736]  I find that threatening.
[02:31:42.816 --> 02:31:43.737]  I'm taking you to jail.
[02:31:43.777 --> 02:31:46.958]  I mean, it's just... It's insane!
[02:31:47.939 --> 02:31:50.360]  And thank God the jury said, this is ridiculous.
[02:31:52.121 --> 02:31:56.203]  But it, and most cops aren't like that, but it shows a growing mindset.
[02:31:57.644 --> 02:31:59.285]  That really did happen.
[02:32:00.034 --> 02:32:05.258]  And we've got many other reports like that, and confirmed reports here locally of things like this happening.
[02:32:07.159 --> 02:32:07.979]  And I know this.
[02:32:08.140 --> 02:32:17.246]  I mean, if I was... He's a nice Christian man, but the former head of the cable company there in Knoxville, Tennessee, they fired him for his political views.
[02:32:18.326 --> 02:32:20.388]  For his views about the New World Order, which is public.
[02:32:20.568 --> 02:32:23.430]  And he ought to try to do something about that.
[02:32:25.411 --> 02:32:29.394]  Because you know, with these discrimination rules, that is discrimination.
[02:32:30.359 --> 02:32:32.681]  But, uh, that's a whole other area.
[02:32:32.721 --> 02:32:39.387]  It's much, much worse when the police begin thinking, well, this video is just something bad about the government.
[02:32:39.407 --> 02:32:40.568]  That ain't allowed!
[02:32:41.569 --> 02:32:43.210]  What planet are you on?
[02:32:44.011 --> 02:32:45.372]  That's all I have to say on that issue.
[02:32:48.215 --> 02:32:51.798]  I mean, the hours late when we start learning of this stuff happening all over the place.
[02:32:52.899 --> 02:32:55.281]  Well, I mean, take my film, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:32:56.377 --> 02:33:00.220]  About eight minutes of that almost three-hour film is Abby Newman.
[02:33:01.081 --> 02:33:07.066]  Naval veteran, no criminal record, Mr. Farming Wife out there milking cows, canning food, good lady.
[02:33:08.047 --> 02:33:10.869]  Pulled over in her little car, going into town, buying canning equipment.
[02:33:10.889 --> 02:33:11.750]  That's why I mentioned the canning.
[02:33:12.550 --> 02:33:16.274]  Rockport, Rockmount, Virginia, State Police.
[02:33:17.234 --> 02:33:18.195]  And we want to search your car.
[02:33:18.235 --> 02:33:19.536]  She goes, this is a random checkpoint.
[02:33:19.556 --> 02:33:20.477]  You admit I've done nothing wrong.
[02:33:20.497 --> 02:33:21.518]  How am I going to let you search my car?
[02:33:22.424 --> 02:33:24.145]  Well, uh, what is in your car?
[02:33:24.185 --> 02:33:24.805]  They arrest her.
[02:33:24.825 --> 02:33:25.565]  She doesn't resist.
[02:33:25.585 --> 02:33:26.345]  They charge her with that.
[02:33:26.365 --> 02:33:28.146]  It's on their own squad car video.
[02:33:28.166 --> 02:33:28.906]  She didn't resist them.
[02:33:29.846 --> 02:33:31.227]  She was found not guilty by the way of that.
[02:33:31.447 --> 02:33:34.428]  Only because they weren't totally evil and didn't erase the tape.
[02:33:34.448 --> 02:33:36.929]  A lot of times the cops will erase it and say you did punch them.
[02:33:37.849 --> 02:33:38.709]  And they go, what's this?
[02:33:38.749 --> 02:33:39.249]  Police State 2000.
[02:33:39.910 --> 02:33:40.370]  What's this?
[02:33:40.630 --> 02:33:44.091]  They get a little pocket constitution and start going, what is this?
[02:33:44.511 --> 02:33:45.211]  What is this?
[02:33:45.571 --> 02:33:46.472]  What is this?
[02:33:46.672 --> 02:33:47.792]  They're like scared, aren't you?
[02:33:47.812 --> 02:33:48.752]  One of them people.
[02:33:51.613 --> 02:33:53.835]  That's the oath you swore to, you fool.
[02:33:53.855 --> 02:33:55.896]  You're holding what you've sworn to.
[02:33:55.916 --> 02:33:57.718]  You know, this is what we look up to.
[02:33:57.738 --> 02:34:01.540]  And you're, well, she's one of them freaks.
[02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:03.041]  Look at this here.
[02:34:03.462 --> 02:34:04.022]  Look at all this.
[02:34:04.062 --> 02:34:06.003]  You've got all kinds of stuff in here.
[02:34:08.465 --> 02:34:09.886]  This might be illegal.
[02:34:10.207 --> 02:34:11.427]  And the other cop goes, I don't know.
[02:34:11.487 --> 02:34:13.469]  I think she's got a right to have that.
[02:34:15.206 --> 02:34:16.227]  Let's have a discussion about it.
[02:34:16.767 --> 02:34:17.387]  Is it allowed?
[02:34:17.407 --> 02:34:18.988]  I mean, that's how they sound.
[02:34:19.008 --> 02:34:19.448]  Is it?
[02:34:19.628 --> 02:34:20.169]  I don't know.
[02:34:20.729 --> 02:34:22.370]  Am I living in the Soviet Union or America?
[02:34:22.530 --> 02:34:23.450]  I guess the Soviet Union.
[02:34:23.550 --> 02:34:24.290]  Let's take it to jail.
[02:34:25.611 --> 02:34:25.911]  Alright.
[02:34:26.892 --> 02:34:27.932]  I mean, that's how they are.
[02:34:28.912 --> 02:34:29.913]  I'm sick of it!
[02:34:30.273 --> 02:34:31.554]  I'm not your slave!
[02:34:31.794 --> 02:34:33.334]  I'm allowed to read what I want.
[02:34:33.594 --> 02:34:41.358]  I'm allowed to stand up for this country against you and your scumbag, drug dealing, murdering bosses that are sucking the Pentagon war chest dry.
[02:34:44.125 --> 02:34:45.966]  Understand, you work for criminals.
[02:34:46.006 --> 02:34:48.067]  Stop judging the world by your views.
[02:34:48.727 --> 02:34:49.587]  Look at the facts.
[02:34:49.747 --> 02:34:49.947]  Alright.
[02:34:50.768 --> 02:34:51.088]  I'm done.
[02:34:51.248 --> 02:34:51.548]  I'm done.
[02:34:51.868 --> 02:34:52.128]  I'm done.
[02:34:52.148 --> 02:34:55.890]  I can tell I'm a little bit angry today, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:35:00.411 --> 02:35:03.152]  Were the levees bombed in New Orleans?
[02:35:03.412 --> 02:35:07.854]  Ninth Ward residents give voice to a conspiracy theory.
[02:35:09.395 --> 02:35:12.456]  Locals officials suggest levees were intentionally blown.
[02:35:13.206 --> 02:35:23.634]  It becomes a strongly held belief by some in the storm zone that the idea of the destruction of New Orleans' heavily black Ninth Ward was neither an accident nor an act of nature.
[02:35:24.555 --> 02:35:33.742]  Diane French, also known as Mama D, and the New Orleans citizen community leader, she testifies before the House Select Committee on Hurricane Katrina on Tuesday.
[02:35:34.963 --> 02:35:37.645]  And that already... I guess that's next Tuesday.
[02:35:37.725 --> 02:35:39.967]  I hope they're demonstrating right now.
[02:35:40.687 --> 02:35:41.708]  I was on the front porch.
[02:35:42.068 --> 02:35:42.749]  I have witnessed
[02:35:44.102 --> 02:35:46.023]  That they bombed the walls of the levee.
[02:35:46.063 --> 02:35:49.766]  Boom, boom, boom, Mama D. Holding her head high.
[02:35:49.846 --> 02:35:51.027]  Mister, I will never forget.
[02:35:52.488 --> 02:35:59.732]  Certainly appears to me to be an act of genocide against the ethnic cleansing, Leah Hodges, another New Orleans resident, told the committee.
[02:36:00.653 --> 02:36:08.038]  Similar statements, sometimes couched as rumors, have also been voiced by Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, and Director Spike Lee.
[02:36:08.058 --> 02:36:09.619]  All right, let's stop right there.
[02:36:10.619 --> 02:36:12.761]  You know, I mean, Spike Lee really is a racist, folks.
[02:36:14.704 --> 02:36:18.327]  In his worry of other people being racist towards him, he has become a racist.
[02:36:18.807 --> 02:36:20.889]  Really, I've heard comments he's made, I don't appreciate it.
[02:36:21.509 --> 02:36:31.036]  But just because he's the spokesman, doesn't mean I'm... or just because Louis Farrakhan has talked about white devils and he saw it from the mother wheel and all that, doesn't mean this didn't happen.
[02:36:32.497 --> 02:36:32.817]  Okay?
[02:36:33.638 --> 02:36:35.479]  I don't know if they had bombs on those levees.
[02:36:35.519 --> 02:36:38.601]  I know people who look pretty credible, say they saw it, they heard it.
[02:36:39.322 --> 02:36:40.983]  There have been cops who say they heard it.
[02:36:41.403 --> 02:36:43.845]  There has been a bunch of people that say they heard it or saw it.
[02:36:44.947 --> 02:36:47.490]  I mean, boom, boom, you have these explosions.
[02:36:47.830 --> 02:36:49.151]  But that could have been a lot of things.
[02:36:49.392 --> 02:36:49.752]  I don't know.
[02:36:49.772 --> 02:36:52.475]  It could have been transformers blowing up in the high winds.
[02:36:52.615 --> 02:36:53.335]  We don't know.
[02:36:54.336 --> 02:36:55.778]  But I do know what we do know.
[02:36:56.573 --> 02:37:12.423]  And what adds a little bit of credence to this is that, just like they said they'd do, they're going in there, they're going to take those people's property in those areas, and they're going to flood it, and they're talking about making it a lake, and making it a greenbelt, and then giving all the other property over to elite corporations to build a bunch of hotels and casinos there.
[02:37:12.683 --> 02:37:17.506]  And I've heard them pushing it all over the news, just like people said they would, and that's exactly what they're doing.
[02:37:19.167 --> 02:37:22.950]  And I know this, FEMA jammed police communications as the hurricane hit.
[02:37:23.450 --> 02:37:24.851]  They were jamming communications.
[02:37:25.968 --> 02:37:26.888]  Never before done.
[02:37:27.028 --> 02:37:27.649]  And they admit it.
[02:37:27.949 --> 02:37:32.250]  And during the disaster, they were cutting police lines, cutting down communications towers.
[02:37:32.550 --> 02:37:38.992]  Police had to, with guns aimed at them, good police, good Americans, had to aim guns at the terrorists.
[02:37:39.052 --> 02:37:40.693]  FEMA, this is mainstream news, mainstream news!
[02:37:41.333 --> 02:37:43.573]  And keep them away from it in at least three parishes.
[02:37:44.154 --> 02:37:48.435]  Actually caught them sneaking around in commando outfits, sabotaging.
[02:37:50.228 --> 02:37:52.349]  Wouldn't let people in to get their friends and family.
[02:37:53.109 --> 02:37:57.631]  Let foods in there for two days within feet of the people until they started rioting on purpose.
[02:37:58.391 --> 02:38:00.892]  They thought, oh see, we need martial law, as Bush said.
[02:38:00.912 --> 02:38:03.313]  We need to use the troops and more control because of this.
[02:38:04.073 --> 02:38:04.914]  That's what's going on.
[02:38:04.974 --> 02:38:08.375]  We know they exacerbated and sabotaged on purpose.
[02:38:08.595 --> 02:38:11.036]  So I don't care if they were bombing it or not.
[02:38:11.256 --> 02:38:12.256]  That doesn't even matter.
[02:38:12.336 --> 02:38:13.557]  I know they sabotaged it.
[02:38:14.924 --> 02:38:17.925]  Now they're having to admit because of e-mails and memos that have served us, they're spinning it.
[02:38:18.245 --> 02:38:29.688]  The memos and e-mails show, and we've got to write an article about this, show clearly, clearly, they're going, well, there's nothing we can do, it's a disaster, so it's just got to be bad as it can and we'll get more fines.
[02:38:30.188 --> 02:38:31.489]  That's an open admission of guilt.
[02:38:31.549 --> 02:38:34.969]  It isn't, FEMA admits that response was broken.
[02:38:35.430 --> 02:38:36.510]  That was the AP headline.
[02:38:37.810 --> 02:38:39.651]  They knew from day one it was broken.
[02:38:42.071 --> 02:38:44.072]  So see, that's, there it is, folks.
[02:38:45.570 --> 02:38:46.390]  I am sullied.
[02:38:46.530 --> 02:38:48.851]  Suicide before dishonor in occupied Iraq.
[02:38:49.211 --> 02:38:52.592]  I cannot support a mission that leads to corruption, human rights abuses, and liars.
[02:38:53.012 --> 02:38:53.752]  I am sullied.
[02:38:53.872 --> 02:38:56.133]  I came to serve honorably and feel dishonored.
[02:38:56.453 --> 02:38:58.133]  Death before being dishonored anymore.
[02:38:58.213 --> 02:39:01.194]  I wish you'd just quit the military and gone public about this.
[02:39:02.795 --> 02:39:09.537]  And the colonel who had been in special forces all over the world saw the murder and death of children and much more and had committed suicide.
[02:39:12.017 --> 02:39:14.678]  And he had also investigated a lot of other abuses and other things.
[02:39:15.739 --> 02:39:21.633]  It's just really sad, but the interesting part of the article admits that they admit
[02:39:22.623 --> 02:39:25.665]  That the Army has come out and said, look, this is all-time suicide rate.
[02:39:25.705 --> 02:39:27.446]  Normally, suicide goes down in combat.
[02:39:28.006 --> 02:39:30.287]  This is way above any other conflict we've ever had.
[02:39:30.307 --> 02:39:31.268]  This is record level.
[02:39:31.768 --> 02:39:34.029]  Because people don't like torturing.
[02:39:34.050 --> 02:39:35.170]  They don't like killing children.
[02:39:35.190 --> 02:39:45.416]  I mean, even... I mean, only real sickos, and they're certainly there and enjoying themselves, you've got to be either totally sick or you can't do this.
[02:39:46.396 --> 02:39:48.117]  See, that's the thing about the evil elite.
[02:39:48.177 --> 02:39:48.818]  They like it.
[02:39:49.955 --> 02:39:51.376]  That's what they're like from another world.
[02:39:51.416 --> 02:39:52.836]  And I mean that figuratively.
[02:39:52.856 --> 02:39:55.578]  They're just from a... Remember Bush Senior?
[02:39:56.138 --> 02:39:57.919]  Just another example of being from another world.
[02:39:57.939 --> 02:40:01.301]  Remember Bush Senior back in the 92 campaign?
[02:40:01.341 --> 02:40:02.721]  I mentioned this yesterday, but it's so important.
[02:40:03.842 --> 02:40:04.942]  He was in a grocery store.
[02:40:05.302 --> 02:40:05.763]  Remember that?
[02:40:05.783 --> 02:40:06.843]  And there was a scanner.
[02:40:08.824 --> 02:40:09.705]  And he said, what's that?
[02:40:09.745 --> 02:40:10.545]  What's that laser?
[02:40:10.585 --> 02:40:11.425]  What is that?
[02:40:11.706 --> 02:40:12.246]  And he wasn't joking.
[02:40:12.266 --> 02:40:15.868]  They're like, Mr. President, that's a... scan food.
[02:40:16.668 --> 02:40:17.188]  Scan it.
[02:40:17.248 --> 02:40:18.069]  Tell me about it.
[02:40:18.149 --> 02:40:18.589]  What is it?
[02:40:21.866 --> 02:40:23.847]  See, that's how out of the loop he'd been.
[02:40:23.867 --> 02:40:26.027]  And he's not even super high-level elite.
[02:40:26.207 --> 02:40:29.468]  Imagine the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds.
[02:40:30.688 --> 02:40:41.832]  I mean, David Rockefeller's been in a Bilderberg Group meeting and his people forgot enough bottles of the wine he likes and he has his private jet fly back just to be back in a few hours with the wine he wants by dinner.
[02:40:43.712 --> 02:40:45.813]  I mean, that's the world they're from.
[02:40:45.853 --> 02:40:46.873]  He means nothing to them.
[02:40:51.957 --> 02:40:55.038]  Continuing here, Patriot Act may be renewed without reforms.
[02:40:55.118 --> 02:40:56.718]  Declan McCullough, ZNET News.
[02:40:58.259 --> 02:41:02.179]  And it says, a frenzy of last-minute negotiations with the Patriot Act conducted behind closed doors.
[02:41:02.620 --> 02:41:09.081]  As of December 31st, expiration date nears, has yielded a four-year renewal of the law and no substantial reforms.
[02:41:09.741 --> 02:41:16.543]  Senator Arnold Spector, the Pennsylvania Republican, who has been a point person during this year's debate over the fate of the complex controversial law.
[02:41:17.615 --> 02:41:28.122]  Said Wednesday that he and his compatriots in the House of Representatives have agreed on a deal that would pave the way for the reauthorization of the Patriot Act next week, in full, with all the goodies and maybe even some stuff added.
[02:41:30.324 --> 02:41:31.244]  Military, U.S.
[02:41:31.264 --> 02:41:34.486]  military, continues Iraq propaganda operation to spy probe.
[02:41:34.907 --> 02:41:45.334]  And they engage in domestic propaganda by telling us in press conferences that these news media are all independent in reporting how much they love the occupation, because that's what they genuinely believe.
[02:41:45.794 --> 02:41:47.275]  So that's propaganda here domestically.
[02:41:48.948 --> 02:41:49.248]  The U.S.
[02:41:49.288 --> 02:42:00.271]  military is conducting and continuing a controversial information operations, oh nice word for it, program that paid Iraqi newspapers to run favorable stories even as it investigates the effort, U.S.
[02:42:00.291 --> 02:42:01.751]  Defense spokesman said Wednesday.
[02:42:01.811 --> 02:42:08.353]  General George Casey has named Rear Admiral Van Buskirk to conduct an investigation of the program.
[02:42:08.733 --> 02:42:08.833]  Ah!
[02:42:10.333 --> 02:42:12.654]  And they say they don't know if there will be any changes to it.
[02:42:14.114 --> 02:42:16.115]  They normally, when they get caught, double the funding.
[02:42:16.135 --> 02:42:17.855]  I don't know why, it's just a rule, they double the funding.
[02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:22.421]  So I predict in a month or two we'll hear of a doubling in funding.
[02:42:22.841 --> 02:42:24.081]  That'll be how they fix it.
[02:42:24.981 --> 02:42:26.002]  Lying is good.
[02:42:26.062 --> 02:42:26.782]  Lying to you.
[02:42:26.822 --> 02:42:30.062]  It's like the new NBC anchor said, we lie to you all the time.
[02:42:31.123 --> 02:42:31.983]  It's not a problem.
[02:42:32.383 --> 02:42:33.163]  Fake news.
[02:42:33.283 --> 02:42:34.684]  It's freedom.
[02:42:36.364 --> 02:42:39.165]  Air marshals pull guns to passengers' heads.
[02:42:39.785 --> 02:42:41.285]  Probe after Miami airport killing.
[02:42:41.325 --> 02:42:45.266]  BBC today reports that this isn't the first time they pull guns and put them on people's heads.
[02:42:47.150 --> 02:42:49.692]  And of course he was having a Prozac moment and going nuts.
[02:42:51.192 --> 02:42:52.493]  And he shot the guy in the back.
[02:42:55.315 --> 02:42:59.798]  And a lot of evidence looks like that he was just, you know, saying, I don't have a bomb.
[02:43:01.038 --> 02:43:03.580]  Here's an article out of the Village Voice today.
[02:43:03.600 --> 02:43:05.441]  Open and shut.
[02:43:06.842 --> 02:43:11.665]  Four years later, we still have ten big questions.
[02:43:12.529 --> 02:43:13.829]  And they go through the ten questions.
[02:43:13.909 --> 02:43:15.870]  Where was the National Command Authority?
[02:43:16.050 --> 02:43:17.590]  On stand down, that's admitted.
[02:43:19.591 --> 02:43:22.872]  That was two months before, given over to Rumsfeld alone.
[02:43:22.912 --> 02:43:25.452]  They took the power away under vice presidential order.
[02:43:25.472 --> 02:43:32.074]  By the way, that was the law since 1947, and they changed it two months before.
[02:43:32.094 --> 02:43:36.335]  Number two, who gave the order to try to shoot down the planes?
[02:43:37.478 --> 02:43:41.260]  Well, that was done after things didn't go quite right with Flight 93, we know that.
[02:43:41.880 --> 02:43:45.122]  What exactly were all those firefighters doing in the towers?
[02:43:47.183 --> 02:43:49.484]  Did anyone think the towers would collapse?
[02:43:49.864 --> 02:43:52.165]  Why was Giuliani's command bunker at Ground Zero?
[02:43:52.525 --> 02:43:55.006]  Why did WTC-7 fall?
[02:43:56.127 --> 02:43:57.868]  How did the Twin Towers fall?
[02:44:00.620 --> 02:44:03.040]  What exactly did Zechariah Macelli plan to do?
[02:44:03.441 --> 02:44:05.301]  What's on those blanked out pages?
[02:44:05.441 --> 02:44:07.741]  These aren't the questions to ask.
[02:44:10.802 --> 02:44:13.142]  Ask the ten real questions.
[02:44:13.822 --> 02:44:28.045]  Why did the White House call Mayor Willie Brown, Zach, and, um, oh, what's the name of the famous writer over there, Salman Rushdie, in England, Ashcroft, all of them, but specifically Willie Brown,
[02:44:28.914 --> 02:44:32.457]  Why'd they call him and say, don't fly on that plane to New York tomorrow morning, it's too dangerous?
[02:44:32.777 --> 02:44:35.759]  Why did some of the Joint Chiefs of Staff cancel a flight from D.C.
[02:44:35.779 --> 02:44:39.342]  to New York that morning until MSNBC, oh, it was for security reasons?
[02:44:40.803 --> 02:44:42.224]  Showing they weren't even involved.
[02:44:42.264 --> 02:44:43.525]  Clearly Myers was.
[02:44:44.026 --> 02:44:50.451]  How did North come and... But, um... At that time, NORAD...
[02:44:51.730 --> 02:44:53.190]  Continuing, breaking!
[02:44:53.230 --> 02:44:58.092]  Military will request $100 billion for Iraq war next year.
[02:44:58.112 --> 02:45:04.514]  Congressman Murtha reveals, and that's $100 billion on top of other spending that's already been funded for next year.
[02:45:06.374 --> 02:45:12.156]  And now they've got Dean and other people out going, well, I guess we need to stay there, but what's our main strategy?
[02:45:12.176 --> 02:45:17.058]  And Hillary talking about the war and how good it is, and Lieberman, how valiant Bush is.
[02:45:17.118 --> 02:45:18.318]  It's all staged.
[02:45:19.526 --> 02:45:21.408]  NATO agrees to expand Afghan role.
[02:45:21.448 --> 02:45:24.511]  Again, after we're done looking bad, they move in as the global bosses.
[02:45:26.393 --> 02:45:28.836]  Bin Laden claim his old video.
[02:45:28.856 --> 02:45:35.662]  Again, they keep recycling the same video, and the news says for a few days it's real, he's going to get you, and then later they admit, oh, it was old video.
[02:45:35.742 --> 02:45:40.127]  They knew it all along, just like the fat Bin Laden, and the fake Bin Laden, and just all of it.
[02:45:41.876 --> 02:45:45.779]  Continuing with the news here for you, U.S.
[02:45:45.819 --> 02:45:49.242]  satellites outnumber rest of the world's satellites combined.
[02:45:49.662 --> 02:45:51.263]  We think, oh, those are our satellites.
[02:45:51.703 --> 02:45:53.165]  Those are the globalist satellites.
[02:45:53.685 --> 02:45:56.827]  No one will be as enslaved as those in the empire.
[02:45:57.328 --> 02:46:02.371]  Lawsuit seeks to stop police surveillance, and these are going all over the country, AP.
[02:46:02.391 --> 02:46:09.797]  A civil rights group citing the First Amendment yesterday asked a judge to stop the police department from routinely videotaping
[02:46:10.433 --> 02:46:11.534]  Political demonstrations, folks.
[02:46:11.574 --> 02:46:14.356]  I've been to land use, Second Amendment rallies, liberal rallies.
[02:46:14.956 --> 02:46:18.879]  There are always, a lot of times, troops, regular army there taking photos.
[02:46:19.660 --> 02:46:22.682]  And the New York Civil Liberties Union said the paper was filed in U.S.
[02:46:22.702 --> 02:46:24.903]  District Court in Manhattan at the Police Department.
[02:46:25.484 --> 02:46:26.625]  Well, I photographed these guys.
[02:46:26.665 --> 02:46:27.525]  I've taken pictures of this.
[02:46:27.725 --> 02:46:28.686]  That's in martial law.
[02:46:29.346 --> 02:46:35.531]  Adopted a regulation on September 10th claiming it may photograph and videotape all political activity in the city without restriction.
[02:46:37.294 --> 02:46:38.855]  Well, what do you think terrorist criminals do?
[02:46:39.255 --> 02:46:43.717]  The surveillance was noted by participants in a protest at the 2004 Republican National Convention.
[02:46:44.338 --> 02:46:44.858]  Oh, yeah!
[02:46:45.959 --> 02:46:52.942]  Especially those who wanted to exercise their First Amendment rights anonymously, said Arthur Eisenberg, a lawyer for the group.
[02:46:52.962 --> 02:46:54.803]  Well, it's a chilling effect.
[02:46:56.613 --> 02:46:58.054]  I mean, I had them march right up to me.
[02:46:58.114 --> 02:46:59.474]  Troops march right up.
[02:46:59.594 --> 02:47:01.555]  I had plainclothes guys march right up.
[02:47:01.695 --> 02:47:03.795]  Aim the big 35mm, the big digital camera.
[02:47:04.236 --> 02:47:05.416]  Photos, video.
[02:47:05.436 --> 02:47:05.836]  You know what?
[02:47:06.256 --> 02:47:07.397]  I'm good.
[02:47:07.457 --> 02:47:08.257]  I love this country.
[02:47:08.277 --> 02:47:09.357]  You're the people that gotta hide.
[02:47:09.677 --> 02:47:11.298]  I put you all over the internet.
[02:47:12.318 --> 02:47:15.219]  And I've had troops march right up to me and go, don't you ever put me on the internet again.
[02:47:15.539 --> 02:47:17.900]  Hey, you secret police scumbag!
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:19.901]  Violating federal law.
[02:47:19.961 --> 02:47:24.182]  Get out of my face, you crook!
[02:47:24.202 --> 02:47:25.183]  The military does that.
[02:47:25.243 --> 02:47:26.143]  It's criminal.
[02:47:27.481 --> 02:47:28.302]  You scum.
[02:47:29.422 --> 02:47:29.682]  You are.
[02:47:29.722 --> 02:47:30.603]  You're just scum.
[02:47:30.623 --> 02:47:31.704]  You're no better than the Nazis.
[02:47:32.024 --> 02:47:35.146]  This has a... Oh, by the way, look at all the problem people saying the same thing I'm saying.
[02:47:35.746 --> 02:47:36.707]  It's over for you.
[02:47:36.747 --> 02:47:39.088]  You can nuke whatever you want, release whatever you want.
[02:47:39.128 --> 02:47:40.709]  We've already got you exposed.
[02:47:40.989 --> 02:47:41.510]  Go ahead.
[02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.890]  Do it.
[02:47:42.630 --> 02:47:42.950]  Go ahead.
[02:47:42.970 --> 02:47:43.851]  You want to play chicken?
[02:47:44.672 --> 02:47:49.494]  This has a wide impact on the common citizen exercising fundamental constitutional rights.
[02:47:50.015 --> 02:47:53.557]  The city law department said it had received the legal papers and was evaluating them.
[02:47:54.355 --> 02:47:57.136]  Well, we're the law department and we just say it's okay.
[02:47:57.436 --> 02:47:58.696]  What does it matter what they say?
[02:47:58.717 --> 02:48:00.037]  They work for the same people.
[02:48:02.418 --> 02:48:02.898]  Oh, man.
[02:48:03.018 --> 02:48:09.740]  I remember before 9-11, we'd be out at a land rights thing just exposing smart growth.
[02:48:09.780 --> 02:48:16.723]  And there'd be guys in suits on top of buildings with gigantic lenses like you see in National Geographic.
[02:48:16.743 --> 02:48:20.544]  You know, four-foot lenses taking pictures of us and smiling and waving.
[02:48:20.804 --> 02:48:21.484]  But you know what?
[02:48:21.544 --> 02:48:23.485]  We'd aim those cameras at them and they'd run.
[02:48:25.385 --> 02:48:27.666]  We'd put their big fat heads on TV.
[02:48:28.646 --> 02:48:30.007]  Your big fat heads.
[02:48:31.248 --> 02:48:32.228]  You scum.
[02:48:33.669 --> 02:48:34.269]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:34.289 --> 02:48:36.130]  I'm really getting mad today.
[02:48:37.571 --> 02:48:39.532]  I love this country.
[02:48:39.592 --> 02:48:42.814]  What's wrong with you idiots who are out here doing this?
[02:48:45.427 --> 02:48:47.709]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.869 --> 02:48:50.973]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.093 --> 02:48:54.997]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:55.057 --> 02:48:59.282]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.622 --> 02:49:03.387]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.547 --> 02:49:05.349]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.609 --> 02:49:08.833]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.873 --> 02:49:13.598]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.758 --> 02:49:16.801]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.981 --> 02:49:19.885]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.325 --> 02:49:26.452]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.972 --> 02:49:30.754]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:51:48.616 --> 02:51:54.639]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:55.239 --> 02:51:58.281]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:05.044 --> 02:52:07.305]  Arnold Schwarzenegger had some heart problems.
[02:52:09.526 --> 02:52:11.407]  Yeah, steroids really enlarge your heart.
[02:52:13.198 --> 02:52:16.560]  And so he was in the hospital, but he's okay now.
[02:52:16.620 --> 02:52:17.000]  Good, good.
[02:52:17.040 --> 02:52:17.841]  I'm really glad.
[02:52:17.901 --> 02:52:18.821]  We really need him.
[02:52:18.861 --> 02:52:23.424]  He's a great American from Austria who wants to take over our country and be a dictator.
[02:52:24.344 --> 02:52:26.065]  And interest grows in Homeland Security.
[02:52:26.105 --> 02:52:27.326]  I could have spent all day on this.
[02:52:27.366 --> 02:52:29.127]  This is AP out of Colorado Springs.
[02:52:29.507 --> 02:52:32.028]  Keeping America safe isn't just the government's job.
[02:52:32.068 --> 02:52:33.369]  It's a citizen's mission, too.
[02:52:33.389 --> 02:52:36.771]  According to the Department of Homeland Security, the Citizen Corps,
[02:52:37.617 --> 02:52:44.824]  And then it gets into the article where, well, there's not, you know, we're not just going to fight terror, we're going to fight crime now and be under the military.
[02:52:45.485 --> 02:52:47.807]  See, notice it's always, we're going to fight terrorists, because they're everywhere.
[02:52:47.827 --> 02:52:49.589]  Everybody, tattle on the terrorists.
[02:52:49.629 --> 02:52:53.213]  And we're neighbors, too, and they're arguing with each other about family violence.
[02:52:53.433 --> 02:52:58.097]  Again, it's just Nazi Germany, tattletale snitch land.
[02:52:58.458 --> 02:53:01.221]  But it's to fight Al-Qaeda and marijuana smokers.
[02:53:02.350 --> 02:53:03.251]  Big, long article.
[02:53:03.271 --> 02:53:04.973]  I think I'm leaving this right here on the top of the stack.
[02:53:04.994 --> 02:53:05.334]  Kamara.
[02:53:05.374 --> 02:53:07.136]  I'm going to spend some time on this.
[02:53:07.677 --> 02:53:09.820]  Mao more lethal than Hitler and Stalin.
[02:53:09.840 --> 02:53:12.783]  I don't know why there are Mao restaurants all over the U.S.
[02:53:12.803 --> 02:53:13.224]  and England.
[02:53:14.385 --> 02:53:15.046]  Praising him.
[02:53:15.727 --> 02:53:17.029]  Put out by degenerate yuppies.
[02:53:17.870 --> 02:53:18.390]  And here's one.
[02:53:18.430 --> 02:53:20.253]  DVLA soldier dead of the criminals.
[02:53:20.273 --> 02:53:21.034]  This is out of England.
[02:53:21.721 --> 02:53:28.604]  And it says that the government, um, well here it is, the government is selling the names and home addresses of motorists on its driver's database to convicted criminals.
[02:53:28.984 --> 02:53:34.827]  A mail-in Sunday investigation has revealed, and it says that, massive identity fraud and problems, and the government did it.
[02:53:35.147 --> 02:53:35.688]  I know!
[02:53:35.868 --> 02:53:37.188]  It's the same thing here!
[02:53:37.668 --> 02:53:38.989]  I see these every two days!
[02:53:39.529 --> 02:53:45.532]  Bank of America gave three million names to a giant criminal organization that engaged in mass fraud!
[02:53:46.773 --> 02:53:48.353]  The answer is casual society!
[02:53:48.454 --> 02:53:49.374]  Oh, that's what caused it!
[02:53:51.030 --> 02:53:52.751]  But again, you don't ever hear about this.
[02:53:53.211 --> 02:53:54.892]  It's in a news item here, a news item there.
[02:53:55.292 --> 02:53:56.332]  We come across this.
[02:53:57.312 --> 02:53:57.913]  I'm out of time.
[02:53:57.933 --> 02:53:58.853]  Ian in New York.
[02:53:58.953 --> 02:53:59.793]  Ian, thanks for holding.
[02:54:00.094 --> 02:54:00.474]  Go ahead.
[02:54:03.715 --> 02:54:04.855]  Or maybe Ian didn't hold.
[02:54:05.716 --> 02:54:07.877]  Maybe Ian punched out and escaped.
[02:54:09.817 --> 02:54:10.398]  You know what?
[02:54:10.758 --> 02:54:12.598]  We'll go to Wolfgang, but we're almost out of time.
[02:54:12.638 --> 02:54:13.579]  Wolfgang in Minnesota.
[02:54:13.599 --> 02:54:13.839]  Go ahead.
[02:54:15.546 --> 02:54:15.986]  Hi, Alex.
[02:54:16.006 --> 02:54:16.466]  How are you doing?
[02:54:16.867 --> 02:54:17.227]  Good, sir.
[02:54:17.267 --> 02:54:17.567]  Go ahead.
[02:54:17.587 --> 02:54:18.327]  We're almost out of time.
[02:54:18.507 --> 02:54:28.732]  Yeah, I put up six vodcast channels on my site, InYourFace.tv, and anybody listening can upload whatever material that's pertinent to that site.
[02:54:29.072 --> 02:54:30.292]  Well, that's a good website name.
[02:54:30.333 --> 02:54:32.073]  Is that just InYourFace.tv?
[02:54:32.333 --> 02:54:33.674]  InYourFace.tv.
[02:54:35.615 --> 02:54:37.496]  Well, that is really exciting, Wolfgang.
[02:54:37.516 --> 02:54:38.076]  You keep it up.
[02:54:38.096 --> 02:54:38.896]  What else is on your mind?
[02:54:40.197 --> 02:54:41.317]  I love your program.
[02:54:41.337 --> 02:54:44.699]  I don't call in very often because I know you've got a lot of stuff to talk about.
[02:54:45.786 --> 02:54:48.927]  I'm busy out here fighting the Infowar right along with you guys.
[02:54:50.088 --> 02:54:53.149]  Wolfgang, it's getting crazier even faster than I thought it would.
[02:54:53.229 --> 02:54:55.029]  Are you amazed by all this craziness?
[02:54:55.589 --> 02:54:58.870]  Oh, it's like I'm living in Nazi Germany Twilight Zone.
[02:54:58.910 --> 02:54:59.651]  I can't believe it.
[02:55:00.191 --> 02:55:01.831]  We've got to do something to turn this around.
[02:55:02.132 --> 02:55:04.872]  I mean, it's accelerating so fast.
[02:55:05.133 --> 02:55:06.073]  Well, we can fight them.
[02:55:06.573 --> 02:55:09.274]  I put up six vodcast channels on my site.
[02:55:10.047 --> 02:55:13.729]  Uh, anybody can upload whatever kind of pertinent material they want to.
[02:55:13.769 --> 02:55:16.571]  We gotta accelerate the attack on them.
[02:55:17.131 --> 02:55:19.873]  Oh, listen, they're moving fast because we're kicking their hind end.
[02:55:19.893 --> 02:55:20.513]  That's right.
[02:55:21.053 --> 02:55:22.354]  And folks, I'm not just saying that.
[02:55:22.874 --> 02:55:27.197]  I mean, I... Listen, again, it's like selling snow cones in hell.
[02:55:27.797 --> 02:55:27.977]  Right.
[02:55:28.017 --> 02:55:29.598]  I mean, it is not hard doing what we do.
[02:55:30.126 --> 02:55:34.629]  I'm listening on KCXL here in Kansas City, Liberty, Missouri.
[02:55:34.949 --> 02:55:35.309]  I'm sorry.
[02:55:35.349 --> 02:55:35.729]  I saw MI.
[02:55:35.829 --> 02:55:37.310]  I thought that was Minnesota.
[02:55:37.490 --> 02:55:37.750]  Nope.
[02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:38.231]  Missouri.
[02:55:38.251 --> 02:55:38.491]  Alright.
[02:55:38.531 --> 02:55:39.571]  Well, KCXL is great.
[02:55:39.591 --> 02:55:40.412]  We appreciate them.
[02:55:40.672 --> 02:55:41.192]  Appreciate it.
[02:55:41.232 --> 02:55:41.572]  Take care.
[02:55:41.873 --> 02:55:42.793]  And I'm so busy.
[02:55:42.873 --> 02:55:47.496]  KCXL has been trying to buy my videos in bulk to sell them in their great bookstore.
[02:55:48.076 --> 02:55:51.238]  And if you guys want to call me, I always mean to call them.
[02:55:51.258 --> 02:55:51.878]  I'm so busy.
[02:55:52.338 --> 02:55:54.459]  Anybody can call us for bulk orders at 512-291-5750.
[02:55:58.061 --> 02:55:59.742]  Be sure and visit the KCXL Bookstore.
[02:55:59.762 --> 02:56:00.722]  Thanks, Wolfgang.
[02:56:00.742 --> 02:56:01.923]  Because that makes me think of that.
[02:56:01.963 --> 02:56:03.964]  You know how, for months, they nicely call.
[02:56:03.984 --> 02:56:04.944]  Can we buy some videos?
[02:56:04.964 --> 02:56:05.765]  Can we get some videos?
[02:56:05.825 --> 02:56:07.686]  And I'm like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:56:07.726 --> 02:56:10.827]  But they call my house, because that's the only number they have, not my office.
[02:56:10.847 --> 02:56:12.488]  So it goes in the black hole.
[02:56:12.808 --> 02:56:13.969]  People need to call my office.
[02:56:15.530 --> 02:56:17.711]  And I got about three people on hold that want to talk to me.
[02:56:17.811 --> 02:56:18.791]  So I'll try to do that.
[02:56:18.831 --> 02:56:21.312]  It's just crazy how much I work, folks.
[02:56:21.332 --> 02:56:23.514]  So I'm sorry if I don't serve all of you properly.
[02:56:23.574 --> 02:56:23.934]  Take care.
[02:56:23.974 --> 02:56:24.314]  God bless.
[02:56:26.095 --> 02:56:31.126]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[02:56:31.146 --> 02:56:31.307]  Hello?
