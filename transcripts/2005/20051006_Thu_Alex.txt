[00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:04.444]  Yeah.
[00:00:05.581 --> 00:00:06.221]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.882 --> 00:00:07.942]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.663 --> 00:00:09.763]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.444 --> 00:00:11.244]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:12.985]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.545 --> 00:00:17.207]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.748 --> 00:00:21.870]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.532]  Our illustrious military
[00:00:35.347 --> 00:00:57.357]  Five years ago, dug up some dead, frozen sailors, some whalers, up near the Arctic Circle at an old cemetery, and they were frozen continually, and they got live 1918 Spanish flu influenza viruses out of their lungs.
[00:01:01.548 --> 00:01:05.193]  And now they're saying scientists have created it.
[00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:08.417]  Why, they have artificially manufactured it.
[00:01:08.457 --> 00:01:08.697]  Yeah.
[00:01:09.037 --> 00:01:09.918]  How did you do that?
[00:01:09.978 --> 00:01:10.980]  By copying
[00:01:11.681 --> 00:01:14.564]  The original viruses that you already had.
[00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:31.097]  Now you're replicating them and simultaneously why the new bird flu is very, very similar and it's going to get you any minute unless we can inject you forcibly and have troops patrolling your streets and running your lives.
[00:01:31.398 --> 00:01:40.025]  And while you're busy worried about that, a couple of select globalists can suck the treasury dry through their corporate welfare.
[00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:43.082]  And that's what they're doing.
[00:01:43.102 --> 00:01:45.403]  $200 plus billion with the Iraq war.
[00:01:45.443 --> 00:01:48.623]  Talking about $200 billion now with Katrina and Rita.
[00:01:49.863 --> 00:01:55.884]  And Bush's speech, he said, you know, there in the French Quarter, oh, it's going to be all locals getting the contracts.
[00:01:55.984 --> 00:01:57.705]  Almost no locals are getting contracts.
[00:01:58.145 --> 00:02:02.285]  In fact, there's only a few contracts out of hundreds in the state of Louisiana or Mississippi.
[00:02:02.926 --> 00:02:03.606]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:02:03.906 --> 00:02:04.666]  All lies.
[00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:06.166]  Who cares if they lie?
[00:02:07.806 --> 00:02:11.507]  So we'll talk about this whole bird flu situation, the Spanish flu situation, all of it.
[00:02:12.654 --> 00:02:16.717]  Bush gives a speech, these evil Islamicists are going to kill us any minute.
[00:02:17.338 --> 00:02:21.201]  They're just deadly, they're everywhere, they're creeping around under every rock.
[00:02:22.062 --> 00:02:25.384]  They don't tell you that our own government funds and controls them.
[00:02:26.105 --> 00:02:39.236]  No, it's every Muslim is going to kill us any minute, and they've got big, long, 14-inch fangs, and they're just sneaking around under every table leg, ready to savage you like demonic pit bulls.
[00:02:39.896 --> 00:02:42.158]  Well, then why does our government bring in record numbers of them?
[00:02:42.972 --> 00:02:44.413]  Again, I don't want to hear it either way.
[00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:52.598]  I mean, if Muslims are the spawn of the Elzebob, or they're wonderful, regardless, why is our government bumping us full of them?
[00:02:53.178 --> 00:02:54.799]  Just as fast as they can.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.482]  Because it's called Balkanization, Order Out of Chaos.
[00:03:00.002 --> 00:03:07.266]  So when you hear a sniveling neocon on the radio, day after day, hour after hour, the Muslims are going to kill us.
[00:03:07.306 --> 00:03:08.107]  They're going to get us.
[00:03:08.127 --> 00:03:09.367]  They're going to savage us.
[00:03:09.507 --> 00:03:10.608]  Oh, I love George Bush.
[00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:12.189]  Oh, he protects us from them.
[00:03:13.027 --> 00:03:15.328]  Why does George Bush bring them in, in such mass?
[00:03:16.768 --> 00:03:19.349]  Again, it doesn't hold water.
[00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:26.130]  Just like, oh, we've got to have troops running your life and aiming machine guns at you and no due process of martial law.
[00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:30.531]  But the borders stay wide open.
[00:03:31.012 --> 00:03:32.452]  None of it holds water.
[00:03:32.912 --> 00:03:34.192]  Alright, I'm not kidding when I say this.
[00:03:34.212 --> 00:03:35.093]  We're going to do it today.
[00:03:35.993 --> 00:03:37.853]  When we get back, I'm going to cover a few news items.
[00:03:38.153 --> 00:03:40.474]  I'm going to go to your calls throughout this broadcast.
[00:03:41.764 --> 00:03:48.650]  Because the callers bring up so many interesting items, directions we never go in, or news that I meant to cover, that I never have time to get to.
[00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:53.874]  You bring it up, and you make the program really educational, really informative.
[00:03:53.914 --> 00:04:05.503]  So, kind of like the C-SPAN Washington Journal format, whatever you want to talk about, you are welcome, but we're going to limit you to about a minute and a half and move on to the next caller, no matter how good your call is.
[00:04:05.523 --> 00:04:10.127]  Because I always get bogged down in all these great calls and let you elaborate forever, and then I end up
[00:04:10.777 --> 00:04:13.639]  Elaborating on it for eons and eons.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.143]  Well, then the show ends and we haven't covered but a tenth of the info that needed to be gone over.
[00:04:20.583 --> 00:04:23.525]  Obviously, there's this espionage case going on in the White House.
[00:04:24.126 --> 00:04:27.628]  And that's nothing, folks, compared to the real espionage going on.
[00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:33.572]  And everybody wants me to talk about this young college student that blew himself up at an OU game.
[00:04:34.572 --> 00:04:35.813]  Yeah, it's very suspicious.
[00:04:35.853 --> 00:04:37.654]  He probably wasn't committing suicide.
[00:04:39.975 --> 00:04:42.557]  By that, he was committing suicide, but not individually.
[00:04:42.577 --> 00:04:47.022]  It probably was some Froot Loop Islamist's follower.
[00:04:48.062 --> 00:04:55.369]  So let's all give our rights up to some nice men in black masks because some jit-faced twit wanted to be a jihadi.
[00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.991]  Not afraid of these people.
[00:04:58.252 --> 00:04:59.313]  There are real jihadis.
[00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:00.013]  We'll take them out.
[00:05:02.461 --> 00:05:05.343]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.583 --> 00:05:07.164]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.504 --> 00:05:12.167]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.507 --> 00:05:19.251]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.571 --> 00:05:21.552]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.752 --> 00:05:24.612]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.712 --> 00:05:29.354]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:33.975]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.215 --> 00:05:41.437]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:06:03.163 --> 00:06:04.204]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.524 --> 00:06:07.325]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.585 --> 00:06:11.728]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:12.168 --> 00:06:12.988]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.308 --> 00:06:17.871]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:20.493]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.994 --> 00:06:21.875]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:22.275 --> 00:06:25.999]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:35.688]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.728 --> 00:06:42.795]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[00:07:01.872 --> 00:07:08.234]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:08.434 --> 00:07:13.435]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:07:13.775 --> 00:07:21.677]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.837 --> 00:07:28.879]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:29.099 --> 00:07:30.320]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.862]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:33.902 --> 00:07:35.022]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:36.583]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:36.803 --> 00:07:43.627]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[00:07:50.452 --> 00:07:53.496]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.657 --> 00:08:28.039]  Welcome my friends, it is Thursday, the 6th day of October 2005 and we're going to be live here for the next 2 hours and 51 minutes.
[00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:30.759]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the broadcast.
[00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:33.440]  The toll free number to get involved on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:37.340]  They're saying this is the first case ever of espionage and spies in the White House.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.361]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:08:47.970 --> 00:08:58.597]  Bill Clinton, over 150 times, had Chinese generals and Chinese spy chiefs in the White House giving them classified briefings.
[00:08:59.258 --> 00:09:00.639]  Openly for campaign cash.
[00:09:01.059 --> 00:09:01.660]  Publicly.
[00:09:02.981 --> 00:09:14.689]  The Commerce Department had Chinese generals and colonels in it with Ron Brown sending literally thousands of faxes and emails to the Communist Chinese.
[00:09:16.881 --> 00:09:21.584]  Alger Hiss running the State Department was an admitted Soviet agent.
[00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:23.085]  The KGB files have been released.
[00:09:23.406 --> 00:09:41.638]  Of course our government knew that the entire time and wanted to arm Russia to build them up so that they could have this false bipolar world and set up a military industrial complex here that of course Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us of in his farewell address in 1961.
[00:09:44.739 --> 00:09:58.265]  So, I mean to say, first case ever, I could literally, well I did literally, I did hundreds of talk shows back in the mid and late 1990s on TV and radio about Bill Clinton the traitor.
[00:10:00.606 --> 00:10:09.970]  And now George Bush does stuff that literally makes that pale in significance and so-called conservatives could care less.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.463]  Just like they could care less that Meyers, this new pick... This is no exaggeration.
[00:10:17.483 --> 00:10:20.224]  It makes Hillary Clinton look conservative.
[00:10:21.685 --> 00:10:22.425]  They don't care.
[00:10:22.805 --> 00:10:26.067]  They're defending her on talk radio right now.
[00:10:26.827 --> 00:10:28.908]  I heard it driving into the office this morning.
[00:10:29.699 --> 00:10:30.359]  It doesn't matter.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.841]  Reality doesn't matter.
[00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:36.303]  The government doubling its growth rate doesn't matter.
[00:10:36.923 --> 00:10:44.468]  Every big socialist, great society, FDR, LBJ program put to shame.
[00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:47.770]  Doesn't matter.
[00:10:48.795 --> 00:10:51.137]  The dollar plunging in value.
[00:10:51.477 --> 00:10:52.018]  Doesn't matter.
[00:10:52.398 --> 00:10:54.280]  The borders completely wide open.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:58.783]  Bush openly calling for complete capitulation and amnesty.
[00:10:59.163 --> 00:10:59.884]  Doesn't matter.
[00:11:00.485 --> 00:11:03.127]  Appointing gun-grabbing judges everywhere.
[00:11:03.567 --> 00:11:05.649]  Appointing people to the federal judiciary.
[00:11:05.809 --> 00:11:08.731]  The Attorney General of Alabama, who went after Judge Roy Moore.
[00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:10.713]  And I hear the sniveling, drooling,
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:19.505]  Moronic, sub-grade moron, neocons, all over talk radio, talking about how Bush is great and the liberals tried to get Judge Moore.
[00:11:22.347 --> 00:11:23.128]  Go from us!
[00:11:23.748 --> 00:11:26.990]  Forget that you were ever our countrymen, go kneel and lick the hand!
[00:11:28.632 --> 00:11:29.312]  It feeds you!
[00:11:31.714 --> 00:11:34.796]  Listen, I could care less about Bush, he's a sniveling puppet!
[00:11:35.556 --> 00:11:41.220]  But he's there to neutralize conservatives, to make you think everything's alright, and let me give you a newsflash.
[00:11:42.131 --> 00:11:46.152]  If Bill Clinton would have tried this, he would have been removed from office.
[00:11:46.192 --> 00:11:46.952]  We almost did it.
[00:11:47.693 --> 00:11:50.013]  But there was sabotage going on with Kenneth Starr and others.
[00:11:50.413 --> 00:11:55.735]  Because he was on Hutchinson Wampoa's main lawyer, getting literally millions from the Chicons.
[00:11:56.235 --> 00:12:01.816]  So they couldn't go after Clinton on any substantive issue, because the Republican leadership was all in it up to their eyeballs.
[00:12:02.437 --> 00:12:04.017]  In fact, it was neocon directives.
[00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.578]  Hey, let us ship reactors to North Korea.
[00:12:06.638 --> 00:12:08.298]  Rumsfeld memos to Clinton, making the money.
[00:12:08.738 --> 00:12:10.619]  Hey, let us give these supercomputers.
[00:12:10.959 --> 00:12:11.239]  Okay.
[00:12:12.054 --> 00:12:24.240]  And then the neocons would all jump up and down screaming at Clinton when he was doing what he was told by the people he vacations with, the people that call him son, the Bushes, who recruited him into the Central Intelligence Agency in the late 1960s.
[00:12:25.161 --> 00:12:26.021]  George Bush Sr.
[00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:28.403]  has been Bill Clinton's handler since 1968.
[00:12:29.623 --> 00:12:31.784]  Do you understand that?
[00:12:31.825 --> 00:12:33.105]  We have the documents.
[00:12:33.425 --> 00:12:34.546]  It is confirmed.
[00:12:34.846 --> 00:12:36.387]  It is well known.
[00:12:40.313 --> 00:12:43.736]  And now you get to see the old spy chief with his greatest protégé.
[00:12:45.298 --> 00:12:49.942]  A person he really considers to be his son, and now they call him son.
[00:12:50.142 --> 00:12:54.246]  And he bad-mouthed Bush Jr., the drooling idiot, and Bush Jr.
[00:12:54.266 --> 00:12:56.008]  says, I don't care, I love Bill Clinton.
[00:12:56.368 --> 00:12:57.149]  You bet you do!
[00:12:57.958 --> 00:13:02.200]  Because your mentor, David Rockefeller, calls him son.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:12.345]  Because Bill Clinton's mother was a well-known whore who was impregnated by the Republican governor who was a Rockefeller, and that is well-known.
[00:13:15.707 --> 00:13:17.648]  Do I have to go on about this anymore?
[00:13:18.048 --> 00:13:19.069]  Wake up!
[00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.810]  It is a staged event.
[00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:24.612]  This is a hereditary gang.
[00:13:25.392 --> 00:13:26.853]  All interbred together.
[00:13:28.888 --> 00:13:35.069]  You know, I say that Kerry and Bush Jr.
[00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:38.590]  are cousins on 16 sides.
[00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:40.510]  And every time I say that, I get emails.
[00:13:41.451 --> 00:13:42.551]  Going, 16 sides?
[00:13:42.931 --> 00:13:43.691]  There's no such thing.
[00:13:44.111 --> 00:13:44.811]  There's two sides.
[00:13:46.072 --> 00:13:46.312]  No.
[00:13:46.852 --> 00:13:48.672]  Every other cousin and uncle is related.
[00:13:48.732 --> 00:13:50.292]  It's just cousins on every side.
[00:13:50.332 --> 00:13:51.853]  It's like a breed of dog.
[00:13:51.913 --> 00:13:55.674]  It's like if you have a basset hound, it's related to every other basset hound on the earth.
[00:13:55.694 --> 00:13:57.334]  Because it comes from that original breed.
[00:13:58.095 --> 00:13:59.656]  If a Boston Terrier it is.
[00:13:59.856 --> 00:14:00.836]  They're all related.
[00:14:01.157 --> 00:14:01.677]  Closely.
[00:14:01.897 --> 00:14:02.997]  I don't mean distant distant.
[00:14:03.198 --> 00:14:05.699]  I mean 3rd cousins, 5th cousins, 9th cousins, 12th cousins.
[00:14:05.719 --> 00:14:07.820]  Just cousins, cousins, cousins, cousins, cousins.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:09.140]  Just everywhere.
[00:14:09.821 --> 00:14:11.141]  Everyone's related to everybody.
[00:14:11.281 --> 00:14:13.983]  When they marry a wife, she's related to everybody.
[00:14:14.103 --> 00:14:15.243]  They're just all cousins.
[00:14:15.584 --> 00:14:17.364]  It's a breed of creature.
[00:14:19.986 --> 00:14:22.107]  That's what they look at is bloodlines.
[00:14:23.487 --> 00:14:24.568]  And they just laugh at us.
[00:14:24.608 --> 00:14:26.649]  They put on these little shows, these little acts.
[00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:33.060]  Right now, the Democrats are out attacking Bush.
[00:14:33.241 --> 00:14:35.662]  Al Gore is saying, America is turning into a police state.
[00:14:35.722 --> 00:14:36.843]  Martial law.
[00:14:37.784 --> 00:14:46.411]  Everything Al Gore and Bill Clinton did is the exact page and verse, just an earlier part of the program, that Bush is now doing.
[00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:52.956]  But see, every time Bush really gets in trouble, Clinton and Gore come out and attack.
[00:14:54.717 --> 00:14:56.318]  And then that actually boosts Bush.
[00:14:56.678 --> 00:14:58.500]  Because that makes conservatives who are going,
[00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:05.948]  Notice, they only attack when conservatives are finally going, wait a minute, Myers might as well be Ho Chi Minh!
[00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:08.529]  This new Supreme Court creature.
[00:15:08.989 --> 00:15:13.430]  Well, wait a minute, Gonzales is more liberal than Mao Zedong, you know.
[00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:15.871]  Literally, what is going on here?
[00:15:17.331 --> 00:15:21.092]  Every time that happens, they come out and try to get us back into our two groups.
[00:15:22.453 --> 00:15:25.413]  And I know I belabor this a lot, but this is the key.
[00:15:26.194 --> 00:15:27.294]  The key to it all.
[00:15:28.172 --> 00:15:31.593]  I know people who will admit, yeah, I know those towers had to be brought down.
[00:15:32.573 --> 00:15:34.694]  Yeah, I know Bush is taking our rights.
[00:15:34.874 --> 00:15:35.554]  Yeah, I know.
[00:15:35.815 --> 00:15:37.935]  Well, at least he ain't Bill Clinton or Hillary.
[00:15:42.117 --> 00:15:48.299]  Rupert Murdoch every week has a four-hour lavish private dinner at his home with Hillary.
[00:15:48.699 --> 00:15:50.139]  They're the best of friends.
[00:15:50.699 --> 00:15:52.320]  And they've always been friends.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:55.721]  Fox News, The Bedrock, it's all
[00:15:56.773 --> 00:15:57.313]  Say it with me.
[00:15:57.814 --> 00:15:58.814]  Staged.
[00:15:59.314 --> 00:16:01.676]  You've heard about the hundreds of millions in fake newscasts.
[00:16:01.716 --> 00:16:05.357]  You've heard about the hundreds of millions in all these fake broadcasts.
[00:16:05.858 --> 00:16:06.878]  You've heard about it all.
[00:16:06.938 --> 00:16:07.619]  You know it.
[00:16:07.759 --> 00:16:08.819]  Why do you buy it?
[00:16:09.239 --> 00:16:10.800]  And that goes for you too, Democrats.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.142]  As soon as the Democrats are in office, you're going to love secret arrest of citizens.
[00:16:14.162 --> 00:16:15.763]  You're going to love Patriot Act 2.
[00:16:16.063 --> 00:16:17.704]  You're going to love gun confiscations.
[00:16:17.724 --> 00:16:19.125]  You're going to love martial law.
[00:16:19.925 --> 00:16:20.505]  Stop it!
[00:16:21.166 --> 00:16:21.706]  Stop it!
[00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:24.463]  Stop being conned!
[00:16:24.903 --> 00:16:26.585]  Stop being manipulated!
[00:16:27.205 --> 00:16:27.726]  Stop it!
[00:16:30.028 --> 00:16:44.502]  We're either all going to come together as populist, populist constitutionalists, and we either see that big government is a tool of the elite, the liberals need to realize, goodness gracious, when I push for big government, I give corporations power.
[00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.589]  Over me.
[00:16:45.669 --> 00:16:47.931]  Political, military, police power.
[00:16:48.412 --> 00:16:49.172]  Do you want that?
[00:16:49.332 --> 00:16:50.253]  Answer is no!
[00:16:50.273 --> 00:16:55.277]  Conservatives need to realize to stop going, all corporations are perfect and I love them.
[00:16:56.097 --> 00:17:00.300]  And so what if they're getting a bunch of big corporate welfare?
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:01.401]  That's horrible!
[00:17:01.461 --> 00:17:05.124]  That's much worse than some woman getting welfare who's got three kids.
[00:17:07.577 --> 00:17:11.719]  You know, it's time to get the paradigm shift in place or it's over!
[00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:14.761]  Sean in Michigan, First Caller, here on the air.
[00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:15.462]  Welcome, Sean.
[00:17:16.002 --> 00:17:17.383]  Oh, thank you very much, Alex.
[00:17:17.523 --> 00:17:21.145]  And I just want to give you some quick news real quick that's positive.
[00:17:21.205 --> 00:17:32.872]  I have been making massive copies of Martial Law, trying to get them out to a lot of my professors and other really intelligent people who I know are watching, because 9-11 really is the basis to getting our freedom back.
[00:17:33.792 --> 00:17:34.833]  That's pretty much everything.
[00:17:35.073 --> 00:17:37.495]  It's their foundation and it's our foundation.
[00:17:37.915 --> 00:17:43.859]  If their fraud fails on this, it is a linchpin.
[00:17:43.919 --> 00:17:44.780]  They're going down.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.621]  Let me tell you something.
[00:17:45.941 --> 00:17:47.842]  We've already got over half the public.
[00:17:49.303 --> 00:17:50.344]  Listen, that's conservative.
[00:17:50.704 --> 00:17:51.625]  That's major polls.
[00:17:51.825 --> 00:17:53.006]  We are winning.
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.341]  Absolutely, Alex.
[00:17:56.041 --> 00:18:02.046]  Something I wanted to ask you about, I had a woman come up to me at my university and hand me a flyer.
[00:18:02.727 --> 00:18:07.331]  It was called, The World Can't Wait, and it was a call to actually drive out.
[00:18:07.871 --> 00:18:09.493]  Man, this is reading off the actual paper itself.
[00:18:10.013 --> 00:18:10.694]  We're good to go.
[00:18:30.237 --> 00:18:36.140]  Or the elite will fund these kinds of programs and then, you know, drag them or drive them into the ground.
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.161]  Well, you can do Yahoo or Google.
[00:18:38.202 --> 00:18:40.643]  I'm going to start trying to promote other search engines.
[00:18:40.683 --> 00:18:42.244]  Google is getting too powerful.
[00:18:42.744 --> 00:18:47.507]  But you can do, by the way, Yahoo is just as good, I've found, or better in some cases.
[00:18:48.807 --> 00:18:56.151]  You need to go and do search engines off the name of the group and then you can track back and trace its lineage.
[00:18:58.706 --> 00:19:00.547]  You know, I've been trying to do a little bit of that.
[00:19:00.567 --> 00:19:03.288]  I haven't been finding out too much information on that.
[00:19:03.348 --> 00:19:04.709]  Well, I wouldn't spend all day on it.
[00:19:04.749 --> 00:19:07.150]  I mean, I wouldn't worry about what other groups are doing.
[00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:08.031]  You're doing the right thing.
[00:19:08.591 --> 00:19:09.392]  Right, right, right.
[00:19:09.672 --> 00:19:11.072]  I mean, you're off waking people up.
[00:19:11.713 --> 00:19:13.494]  Yeah, without a doubt, without a doubt.
[00:19:13.794 --> 00:19:18.536]  Have you actually found out who is funding these Reconquista and LaRoz groups?
[00:19:19.537 --> 00:19:22.978]  Yes, the State Department, the Defense Department, and the Ford Foundation.
[00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:23.879]  Really?
[00:19:25.174 --> 00:19:29.337]  Oh yeah, well those are all very upstanding Hispanic organizations, aren't they?
[00:19:30.477 --> 00:19:35.881]  Well, yeah, I mean I want to ask them why the military industrial complex is funding them if they're so revolutionary.
[00:19:36.708 --> 00:19:37.068]  Oh yeah.
[00:19:37.269 --> 00:19:38.849]  Listen, I appreciate your call, my friend.
[00:19:38.889 --> 00:19:39.390]  You keep it up.
[00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:41.511]  What response have you gotten giving out martial law?
[00:19:41.871 --> 00:19:43.272]  Oh, I've gotten a great response.
[00:19:43.292 --> 00:19:50.436]  You know, when people come back in there, they're talking about it, uh, you know, in school and stuff, and, uh, you know, I'm talking about it in class, making comments about it.
[00:19:50.537 --> 00:19:53.518]  Well, tell them, tell them to pay it, tell them to pay it forward.
[00:19:53.538 --> 00:19:54.599]  You ever seen Pay It Forward?
[00:19:54.979 --> 00:19:55.760]  Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.340]  Kevin Spacey movie?
[00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:57.641]  Yeah, tell them to pay it forward.
[00:19:57.921 --> 00:19:58.301]  Thank you.
[00:19:58.341 --> 00:19:59.162]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:19:59.182 --> 00:19:59.542]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.917 --> 00:20:08.804]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:20:08.944 --> 00:20:21.816]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:20:22.196 --> 00:20:23.858]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:20:24.018 --> 00:20:27.481]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:20:27.761 --> 00:20:31.544]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:20:31.805 --> 00:20:36.769]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:38.731]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:20:38.991 --> 00:20:42.976]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[00:20:43.236 --> 00:20:45.098]  Dango is what you are looking for.

[00:20:51.666 --> 00:20:52.206]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[00:21:03.948 --> 00:21:08.450]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:12.872]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:21:13.172 --> 00:21:13.712]  We listened.
[00:21:14.032 --> 00:21:19.014]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:19.774]  We listened.
[00:21:20.155 --> 00:21:23.196]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:21:23.616 --> 00:21:24.156]  We listened.
[00:21:24.616 --> 00:21:28.518]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[00:21:28.558 --> 00:21:29.298]  I think so.
[00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:55.476]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[00:21:55.496 --> 00:21:56.680]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:02.475 --> 00:22:03.455]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:08.317]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:22:08.477 --> 00:22:16.280]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.922]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:22:22.122 --> 00:22:29.104]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:22:29.404 --> 00:22:34.746]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[00:22:34.986 --> 00:22:39.727]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[00:22:40.068 --> 00:22:47.650]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[00:22:48.010 --> 00:22:54.256]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[00:22:54.576 --> 00:22:55.697]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:55.717 --> 00:22:55.997]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.265 --> 00:23:06.148]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:23:06.288 --> 00:23:08.049]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:23:08.109 --> 00:23:09.370]  But not just any water.
[00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:13.674]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:23:13.734 --> 00:23:23.441]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:23:23.741 --> 00:23:29.348]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[00:23:29.528 --> 00:23:34.133]  Use topically to treat acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burns, skin rashes, and more.
[00:23:34.313 --> 00:23:38.258]  Use EO orally to treat sore throat, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.

[00:23:53.812 --> 00:23:54.233]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:24:10.495 --> 00:24:12.177]  Let's continue with your phone calls.
[00:24:12.357 --> 00:24:17.643]  And I'm going to get into all this espionage news, the Barton Blue information, a lot more.
[00:24:18.163 --> 00:24:19.484]  Richard in Nebraska.
[00:24:19.845 --> 00:24:20.466]  You're on the air.
[00:24:20.506 --> 00:24:21.166]  Welcome, Richard.
[00:24:21.407 --> 00:24:21.767]  Hi.
[00:24:21.927 --> 00:24:31.617]  I just heard on the main news last night where they're saying the CIA is now refusing to appear in front of the September 11th Commission.
[00:24:31.898 --> 00:24:33.139]  I don't know what they're trying to...
[00:24:33.982 --> 00:24:36.583]  Make out of it, because I... It's more theater.
[00:24:36.603 --> 00:24:38.484]  They're acting like the commission's real.
[00:24:38.504 --> 00:24:50.528]  They're acting like... And then the former head of the CIA is... Tenants refusing to testify, and we're not about to... We have executive privilege, yes.
[00:24:50.988 --> 00:24:55.930]  Oh, it's just more of a... What you would call a showpiece to give emphasis on themselves, huh?
[00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:57.810]  Well, they constantly do that.
[00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.991]  Ah, right, right, right.
[00:25:00.612 --> 00:25:05.954]  Okay, I just noticed that on the news and I thought I'd... Yeah, they play these little ruses on a daily basis.
[00:25:06.014 --> 00:25:17.919]  It is totally... You know, it's like we've got all these whistleblowers about torture in Abu Ghraib and in Iraq going and testifying and McCain sits there and listens and it all goes right down the toilet.
[00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:19.420]  Oh, yeah.
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:20.860]  Yeah, that's disgusting.
[00:25:21.100 --> 00:25:22.901]  That's so disgusting that they do that.
[00:25:24.482 --> 00:25:26.823]  Tell me, soldier, everything you know.
[00:25:27.183 --> 00:25:29.564]  Tell me every contact, but tell me in executive session.
[00:25:30.382 --> 00:25:34.504]  Well, I think under that you have to only tell your name, rank, and serial number.
[00:25:34.664 --> 00:25:36.384]  You used to be in the old days, that was.
[00:25:36.524 --> 00:25:40.806]  Well, they think that they're blowing the whistle, and then they go off and die in a car wreck.
[00:25:41.646 --> 00:25:41.726]  Oh.
[00:25:42.967 --> 00:25:43.207]  Yeah.
[00:25:43.767 --> 00:25:45.548]  It's all an intelligence operation.
[00:25:46.108 --> 00:25:50.470]  I believe that, especially after what they did to Michael New and everything.
[00:25:50.490 --> 00:25:52.750]  I appreciate your call.
[00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:53.651]  Anything else on your mind?
[00:25:54.011 --> 00:25:54.411]  No, sir.
[00:25:54.451 --> 00:25:54.751]  Thank you.
[00:25:55.011 --> 00:25:56.012]  Thank you, Richard.
[00:25:56.052 --> 00:25:56.592]  Thank you, sir.
[00:25:57.276 --> 00:25:57.516]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:57.536 --> 00:26:00.277]  Wide open phones.
[00:26:00.717 --> 00:26:03.337]  We're taking your calls.
[00:26:03.357 --> 00:26:03.898]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:26:04.598 --> 00:26:08.559]  We always love first-time callers.
[00:26:09.119 --> 00:26:12.700]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mike in Florida.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:13.340]  Welcome, sir.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:14.920]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.381]  I just wanted to make a comment about your websites being down.
[00:26:17.401 --> 00:26:19.561]  My websites aren't down.
[00:26:19.581 --> 00:26:20.982]  They're being blocked by Time Warner.
[00:26:21.402 --> 00:26:23.462]  Right, that's what I mean, being blocked by Time Warner.
[00:26:23.502 --> 00:26:26.043]  I mean, you know, to me, that's just a last straw.
[00:26:26.528 --> 00:26:36.854]  I've listened to you for a long time, and things like this just wide out in the open, censorship is disgusting, and I made a call this morning, and it was just like, of course I got to run around by some girl up in Canada.
[00:26:36.935 --> 00:26:49.222]  I was talking to somebody in Canada, and I asked her all these questions about, first she tells me she's got a list of these websites that are also having trouble, then I ask her, oh great, well give me some names of the list, you know, give me some names off the list, I'll try right now.
[00:26:49.442 --> 00:26:50.903]  Well I don't have any names off the list.
[00:26:51.303 --> 00:26:53.865]  But first she tells me she's got one, then all of a sudden she doesn't have it.
[00:26:53.885 --> 00:26:55.386]  Well let me, let me explain what's happened.
[00:26:57.341 --> 00:26:59.622]  You know, George Norrie last night was really concerned.
[00:27:00.162 --> 00:27:00.783]  They called me up.
[00:27:00.803 --> 00:27:01.603]  They said, what's happening?
[00:27:01.623 --> 00:27:03.004]  Do you want to come on and talk about it?
[00:27:03.024 --> 00:27:03.724]  And I said, no.
[00:27:04.384 --> 00:27:05.885]  Let me give them some time to fix it.
[00:27:06.485 --> 00:27:11.907]  And I don't know if Time Warner realizes that we're going to have to go on 580 radio stations and talk about this.
[00:27:11.947 --> 00:27:13.928]  I mean, if I want to, I can go right on and talk about it.
[00:27:14.668 --> 00:27:17.289]  And we've done the traceroutes.
[00:27:17.309 --> 00:27:23.492]  We've had people all over the country, from Ohio to Kansas City to Austin, Texas, send their traceroutes to them.
[00:27:24.302 --> 00:27:26.104]  And it's not our DNS servers.
[00:27:26.944 --> 00:27:29.707]  It is a blockage in their system.
[00:27:29.887 --> 00:27:30.888]  We now have it confirmed.
[00:27:31.328 --> 00:27:32.649]  Blocking us.
[00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.231]  And we even know the switch that's doing it.
[00:27:35.712 --> 00:27:37.493]  And they will not go flip it.
[00:27:38.114 --> 00:27:39.375]  They will not go fix it.
[00:27:40.416 --> 00:27:41.517]  There is a block there.
[00:27:41.577 --> 00:27:42.678]  Now was it intentional?
[00:27:43.478 --> 00:27:45.981]  This has been going on and off with them.
[00:27:46.001 --> 00:27:47.902]  And you've got to realize, we did get the number.
[00:27:48.543 --> 00:27:50.825]  In between AOL, it's AOL and Time Warner.
[00:27:50.885 --> 00:27:52.126]  Roadrunner in the dial-up with AOL.
[00:27:53.178 --> 00:27:55.499]  Around 26% of the total U.S.
[00:27:55.559 --> 00:27:58.001]  market, we cannot get to at this point.
[00:27:58.581 --> 00:28:01.763]  People are literally, we're getting hundreds and hundreds of emails an hour.
[00:28:02.023 --> 00:28:03.764]  People are absolutely flipping out.
[00:28:04.684 --> 00:28:06.465]  It's like withdrawals or something.
[00:28:06.905 --> 00:28:08.266]  And there's nothing wrong with our websites.
[00:28:08.306 --> 00:28:08.646]  They're up.
[00:28:08.686 --> 00:28:10.007]  They're sailing along nicely.
[00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:14.889]  And look, you already can't get on at almost all the libraries, colleges.
[00:28:15.149 --> 00:28:16.770]  They admittedly have filters on us.
[00:28:17.391 --> 00:28:21.933]  Yeah, it's definitely intentional because the bottom line is you're scaring the hell out of them.
[00:28:22.475 --> 00:28:26.636]  And, uh, you know, your website gets a ton of hits, and the truth is coming out, man.
[00:28:26.836 --> 00:28:28.536]  And, you know, they're running for cover.
[00:28:28.636 --> 00:28:29.477]  That's all there is to it.
[00:28:29.497 --> 00:28:30.217]  You've got them scared.
[00:28:30.657 --> 00:28:31.677]  I mean, what else can it be?
[00:28:32.057 --> 00:28:35.758]  Well, you know, yesterday we said, you know, we don't know, we know they're blocking us.
[00:28:35.818 --> 00:28:38.899]  Now, we specifically talked to high-level IT people.
[00:28:39.139 --> 00:28:41.799]  They know they're blocking it, and they just won't fix it.
[00:28:42.379 --> 00:28:44.900]  Yeah, after that call I made this morning, you can tell people
[00:28:45.373 --> 00:28:47.535]  You know, I just get the feeling that they know what's going on.
[00:28:47.555 --> 00:28:48.916]  They're just afraid to say it.
[00:28:49.236 --> 00:28:49.776]  That's all it is.
[00:28:49.796 --> 00:28:53.799]  Well, I gotta tell you, the person you're probably talking to knows a little bit about it, but not much.
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.060]  No, I asked her.
[00:28:55.121 --> 00:28:56.161]  She actually admitted that.
[00:28:57.042 --> 00:29:02.886]  She actually admitted to me that, yeah, under circumstances, the government can come in and tell them which sites to censor.
[00:29:02.926 --> 00:29:05.048]  She actually admitted that to me in not so many words.
[00:29:05.348 --> 00:29:06.589]  And I said, well, are you happy with that?
[00:29:06.609 --> 00:29:07.590]  Do you live with that?
[00:29:07.690 --> 00:29:09.331]  Are you Canadians happy with stuff like that?
[00:29:09.612 --> 00:29:10.752]  Well, there's nothing we can do.
[00:29:11.093 --> 00:29:13.234]  I said, well, you're just as spineless as most Americans.
[00:29:14.175 --> 00:29:14.836]  You know, it's crap.
[00:29:15.683 --> 00:29:21.128]  I said, you're perfectly willing to admit that the government can come in and censor you, and there's nothing you can do about it.
[00:29:21.148 --> 00:29:23.410]  It was just, it made my, it made me sick.
[00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:28.155]  Well, there is something people can do about it, and that's drop Time Warner ALL.
[00:29:28.175 --> 00:29:28.815]  Thanks for the call.
[00:29:29.456 --> 00:29:29.796]  You bet.
[00:29:30.016 --> 00:29:32.439]  And listen, I think the service with Roadrunner is good.
[00:29:32.459 --> 00:29:33.500]  I mean, I've had other services.
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:34.000]  I have it.
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:35.962]  Listen, I can't get on my own website.
[00:29:36.843 --> 00:29:39.245]  I'm on a RovinNet dial-up, which is working pretty good.
[00:29:39.969 --> 00:29:41.951]  But uploading websites is hard with the dial-up.
[00:29:42.452 --> 00:29:46.456]  And I mean, it's just every roadrunner in the country is just gone.
[00:29:47.337 --> 00:29:49.239]  And they know the problem and won't fix it.
[00:29:51.702 --> 00:29:52.623]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.103 --> 00:29:54.705]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:58.309]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.988 --> 00:30:05.448]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[00:30:05.648 --> 00:30:09.729]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[00:30:09.869 --> 00:30:17.171]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste bill, is something we all face every day.
[00:30:17.451 --> 00:30:19.371]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[00:30:19.671 --> 00:30:26.432]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long life battery lasts for 10 years.
[00:30:26.772 --> 00:30:29.633]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy tested.
[00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:35.376]  Your Nuke Alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.

[00:30:54.225 --> 00:30:58.147]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nuke Alert today.
[00:30:58.327 --> 00:30:58.768]  Nuke Alert.
[00:30:59.068 --> 00:31:00.129]  Isn't your family worth it?
[00:31:02.030 --> 00:31:05.592]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.632 --> 00:31:06.152]  are located?
[00:31:06.352 --> 00:31:09.734]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[00:31:09.954 --> 00:31:14.677]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.
[00:31:14.937 --> 00:31:19.960]  With the more than 50 interactive parameters, you can pinpoint natural and man-made disaster areas.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:20.781]  We're good to go.
[00:31:38.854 --> 00:31:39.174]  I think so.
[00:32:02.108 --> 00:32:05.249]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.

[00:33:02.718 --> 00:33:07.863]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.543 --> 00:33:10.925]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:13.828 --> 00:33:18.872]  I've been living this so long, I've gotten so close to the problem that I get desensitized.
[00:33:20.674 --> 00:33:28.080]  George Bush openly, two days ago, I mean saying yesterday, saying we need the troops to forcibly inoculate the public,
[00:33:28.991 --> 00:33:31.792]  Lockdown cities, not let you leave, martial law.
[00:33:31.872 --> 00:33:34.093]  And CNN said, this is martial law.
[00:33:34.113 --> 00:33:41.696]  I mean, we're openly hearing discussions of martial law, but the borders will stay wide open, but you're going to be under martial law.
[00:33:42.176 --> 00:33:43.336]  And then there's a flood.
[00:33:43.456 --> 00:33:44.517]  We need martial law.
[00:33:44.537 --> 00:33:45.317]  There's a hurricane.
[00:33:45.637 --> 00:33:46.637]  We need martial law.
[00:33:46.737 --> 00:33:47.998]  Terrorists are going to attack us.
[00:33:48.318 --> 00:33:49.898]  We need trips in the grocery stores.
[00:33:50.219 --> 00:33:52.159]  We need trips in the shopping malls.
[00:33:52.219 --> 00:33:57.181]  I mean, they're openly saying this, and they're saying, oh, by the way, they'll search you for guns and drugs while they're at it.
[00:33:58.149 --> 00:34:00.310]  Mixing guns in with the word drugs.
[00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:11.374]  Anybody figuring this out, I mean, they're just constantly basting us, acclimating us, preparing us to accept this takeover.
[00:34:12.914 --> 00:34:15.255]  And it should make everybody really upset and angry.
[00:34:15.996 --> 00:34:19.857]  The feds can't protect you, they won't protect you, they're not going to protect you.
[00:34:21.152 --> 00:34:29.194]  Now, we're going to... Oh, Alex and Matt just hung up, so we're going to go to John, Jeff, Steve, Justin, and many others here in just a few minutes.
[00:34:30.975 --> 00:34:33.436]  But what you need to talk about is this endless fear-mongering.
[00:34:35.716 --> 00:34:39.257]  And you know, some people don't like it that I said that SARS was a fraud.
[00:34:39.897 --> 00:34:48.660]  A billion of us were going to die, didn't kill a billion people, killed a couple hundred, and then later they said in the medical journals, well, we don't even know if that was SARS.
[00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:52.110]  We don't even know if that was SARS.
[00:34:52.150 --> 00:35:10.315]  We just... SARS is a nice little term, and it's some respiratory problem, and there'll just be people dying from the flu, but, you know, we just, we gotta have quarantines in Dallas and Toronto, and we gotta talk about forcible injections and martial law, and, oh, now the avian flu's coming, it's gonna kill a billion of you, give up all your rights.
[00:35:12.976 --> 00:35:14.056]  And I'm sorry, folks.
[00:35:14.616 --> 00:35:17.517]  Even if this stuff's real, giving up your rights isn't gonna do anything.
[00:35:18.266 --> 00:35:19.788]  Giving up your freedom isn't going to do anything.
[00:35:20.208 --> 00:35:24.552]  It's not going to stop a bird, you know, geese, from flying into your area.
[00:35:25.573 --> 00:35:30.278]  And by the way, it's always been rats, and fleas, and things that bite you.
[00:35:30.999 --> 00:35:37.125]  And, you know, things that you end up eating, or things that you end up being in close contact with, that you get these things from.
[00:35:37.445 --> 00:35:40.989]  You don't just like, oh no, somebody's got it, we're all dead.
[00:35:44.252 --> 00:35:51.114]  But I'm saying the threat's real because the government could use a nerve gas or they could use just an outbreak of something they release that's controllable.
[00:35:51.134 --> 00:35:52.695]  I mean, they almost shut D.C.
[00:35:52.755 --> 00:35:58.077]  down and didn't let them have protests because, oh, we found some rabbit fever.
[00:35:59.677 --> 00:36:00.277]  Why rabbit?
[00:36:00.537 --> 00:36:02.138]  Rabbit fever's no big deal, folks.
[00:36:02.818 --> 00:36:04.139]  Well, we did find small traces.
[00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:11.301]  We had biological testers out in the crowd and, ooh, see, we may not allow big gatherings anymore because rabbit fever run from the hills!
[00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:17.592]  I'm not going to be a willing or unwilling dupe of this.
[00:36:17.672 --> 00:36:20.915]  I'm not going to go along with it and help create the hype and the fear.
[00:36:21.195 --> 00:36:26.118]  You should be concerned and afraid though because they are hyping this up and they are gearing up for something.
[00:36:30.201 --> 00:36:34.605]  I've gotten phone calls from people, hey man, stop saying it's not a threat.
[00:36:38.988 --> 00:36:39.789]  I'm my own person.
[00:36:39.809 --> 00:36:42.451]  I haven't bowed to the New World Order and I'm not going to bow to anybody else.
[00:36:42.891 --> 00:36:43.451]  Except God.
[00:36:45.655 --> 00:36:55.205]  But because we are in this atmosphere of martial law, and it's good for you, and foreign troops are here to help, and bio-attacks are coming, the point is you better have some storable food.
[00:36:55.866 --> 00:36:57.988]  Whether it's a month, you know, something.
[00:36:58.949 --> 00:36:59.830]  You better just do it.
[00:37:00.291 --> 00:37:03.374]  And then if nothing happens in a year, eat that food and buy more.
[00:37:03.734 --> 00:37:05.236]  I mean, you better do this, folks.
[00:37:05.256 --> 00:37:06.537]  You better have water filters.
[00:37:06.557 --> 00:37:08.159]  You better have some firearms and ammo.
[00:37:08.889 --> 00:37:19.794]  It's great to have some boogie point, some family that's got a farm or a ranch or some property, two acres, it doesn't matter, out in the middle of nowhere, that's got water nearby.
[00:37:20.254 --> 00:37:29.558]  Where if something does get released, or they say something's released and they're locking cities down, you can get away from it and be out there for six months a year and take care of your family.
[00:37:29.939 --> 00:37:32.880]  So when the army trucks are driving around forcibly injecting people,
[00:37:33.742 --> 00:37:39.367]  You know, with their lobotomy injections, that you won't be part of it.
[00:37:39.928 --> 00:37:41.049]  Everything will be alright now.
[00:37:41.089 --> 00:37:42.110]  You're about to join us.
[00:37:42.530 --> 00:37:43.231]  Here's your shot.
[00:37:43.291 --> 00:37:44.271]  We love you.
[00:37:44.291 --> 00:37:46.073]  There, now you won't worry too much.
[00:37:46.493 --> 00:37:47.875]  I mean, really, it's coming down to that.
[00:37:47.895 --> 00:37:49.976]  It's body snatcher level.
[00:37:50.297 --> 00:37:51.978]  Don't worry about the fake plagues.
[00:37:52.018 --> 00:37:53.279]  Worry about the injections.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.101]  Worry about the troops they send.
[00:37:55.421 --> 00:37:56.262]  Worry about that.
[00:37:59.349 --> 00:38:05.455]  Worry about not screaming bloody murder and getting involved and saying, we know the government's behind terrorism.
[00:38:05.736 --> 00:38:10.140]  We know that they've been behind the chemical, biological, and radiological testing in the past.
[00:38:10.521 --> 00:38:14.885]  We know about the atomic soldiers and the atomic children here and in Israel and in Russia.
[00:38:15.165 --> 00:38:19.970]  We know about all the testing, the thousands of open-air testing of chemical and biologicals on us.
[00:38:20.811 --> 00:38:22.593]  We know about it all!
[00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:29.214]  And so if anything does happen, we don't trust you, and we don't like you, and we're going to blame you.
[00:38:30.976 --> 00:38:34.800]  Because you didn't control the borders, and because evidence shows you're going to be behind the attacks.
[00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:38.663]  Then they'll stick their finger up the wind and go, oh, they're not going to buy it, we can't do it.
[00:38:38.684 --> 00:38:45.270]  Look, they already tried forcible injection of 14 million people in 2002.
[00:38:48.095 --> 00:38:58.459]  The Associated Press and the LA Times both reported that 99 plus percent refused.
[00:38:58.479 --> 00:39:04.862]  4,000 firemen, police, medical workers out of 14 million.
[00:39:06.363 --> 00:39:07.583]  The majority were medical workers.
[00:39:07.603 --> 00:39:11.225]  4,000 out of 14 million took the shots.
[00:39:14.932 --> 00:39:24.020]  And I remember talking to Austin Coffin, we had sheriffs on, we had fire chiefs on, they were going, they've told us our insurance is revoked and we don't take these shots.
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.081]  Well, we're not taking it!
[00:39:25.422 --> 00:39:26.863]  There just won't be a fire department!
[00:39:28.765 --> 00:39:32.508]  And I had countless ones on from Arkansas and Florida and Texas.
[00:39:33.809 --> 00:39:34.590]  Why did they do it?
[00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:38.794]  Because people said the Emperor has no clothes.
[00:39:40.035 --> 00:39:41.376]  The Emperor is butt-naked.
[00:39:43.453 --> 00:39:51.060]  Because a whole bunch of epidemiologists and virologists and scientists and nurses and doctors went forward and said, wait a minute.
[00:39:51.701 --> 00:39:54.263]  Smallpox, if an enemy attacks us, is going to be weaponized.
[00:39:54.644 --> 00:39:56.786]  The smallpox vaccine doesn't protect against that.
[00:39:57.787 --> 00:40:02.351]  And they gave the troops the anthrax shots and all the medical reports say it made them really sick and didn't even protect them.
[00:40:03.399 --> 00:40:08.740]  Covered seven spore types, when the Russian variety alone has 150-300 spore varieties.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.800]  It doesn't even protect you.
[00:40:11.221 --> 00:40:12.281]  Why should we take this?
[00:40:12.681 --> 00:40:17.242]  And by the way, it's going to kill thousands of people if 14 million of us take it.
[00:40:17.282 --> 00:40:18.102]  That's the numbers.
[00:40:18.422 --> 00:40:23.483]  And it will actually spread live smallpox and can cause a limited outbreak.
[00:40:25.223 --> 00:40:27.284]  And Tommy Thompson said, no, you've got to take it.
[00:40:27.504 --> 00:40:28.224]  There was no law.
[00:40:28.264 --> 00:40:29.744]  He tried to get states to pass laws.
[00:40:30.064 --> 00:40:30.945]  A handful did.
[00:40:31.305 --> 00:40:33.165]  Modeled states health emergency powers act.
[00:40:37.113 --> 00:40:37.713]  Think about that.
[00:40:38.254 --> 00:40:41.216]  And then a year after, when they canceled the program, he said, I'm not going to take it.
[00:40:41.256 --> 00:40:42.057]  I never said take it.
[00:40:42.217 --> 00:40:43.918]  When he'd been all over TV saying take it.
[00:40:44.158 --> 00:40:45.439]  You remember that, but listen.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.741]  This shows us something good.
[00:40:48.662 --> 00:40:51.264]  The cops may carry out unconstitutional operations.
[00:40:52.004 --> 00:40:54.406]  The doctors might, you know, when they're being oppressive.
[00:40:54.906 --> 00:40:57.788]  But bottom line, they deep down now don't trust the government.
[00:40:58.169 --> 00:41:01.191]  And the word got out with them, and they went, no, this doesn't make sense.
[00:41:01.571 --> 00:41:02.672]  No, I'm not going to take that.
[00:41:03.292 --> 00:41:03.773]  No way.
[00:41:03.793 --> 00:41:05.054]  14 million, 4,000 dead.
[00:41:07.541 --> 00:41:08.482]  Four thousand!
[00:41:11.144 --> 00:41:18.148]  And then they told police and the local military units, National Guard, oh, we're going to train you and pay you for forced inoculation.
[00:41:18.188 --> 00:41:26.874]  We're going to use all the local sports stadiums at the high schools and middle schools to do this and we're going to take people in and if they refuse, we're going to have to use lethal force.
[00:41:27.174 --> 00:41:28.595]  And they said, no, uh-uh, uh-uh.
[00:41:28.975 --> 00:41:31.617]  They said, you don't have to take it, but you have to train to force those to take it.
[00:41:31.977 --> 00:41:34.419]  And the majority of the people said, no, I'm not going to do that either.
[00:41:36.701 --> 00:41:37.101]  No way.
[00:41:38.849 --> 00:41:45.950]  And then she magically now, oh the SARS will get you, oh the bird flu will get you, oh it's all over!
[00:41:46.490 --> 00:42:05.274]  Then a bunch of people jump on the bandwagon and they've got the magic super bullet that will just defeat... I mean you could, you know, aim a magic pyramid at it, or a magic spray, or throw a magic pill at it, and if a 14 mile, 15 mile across asteroid's coming at the Earth, it'll make it just a poof in the smoke.
[00:42:05.354 --> 00:42:07.494]  I mean, instead of telling people just
[00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.791]  Yeah, you should be healthy.
[00:42:09.811 --> 00:42:10.692]  You should be jogging.
[00:42:10.712 --> 00:42:11.793]  You should be getting in shape.
[00:42:12.113 --> 00:42:13.474]  You should be eating healthy food.
[00:42:13.494 --> 00:42:19.819]  You shouldn't be drinking aspartame or eating artificial salts like MSG.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:21.100]  Excuse me.
[00:42:22.041 --> 00:42:23.121]  You should be doing all this.
[00:42:24.623 --> 00:42:30.667]  I'm not knocking all that, but the point is we should really be getting prepared instead of cuddling in the corner with a bottle of God liquid or whatever.
[00:42:34.904 --> 00:42:38.209]  I mean, you know, we don't need magic talismans, folks.
[00:42:38.269 --> 00:42:42.195]  We need God and we need the will and the courage to stand up against this.
[00:42:42.355 --> 00:42:47.183]  I just see the Patriot community descending into orgies of snake oil.
[00:42:47.868 --> 00:42:50.129]  And, uh, that's stupid.
[00:42:50.190 --> 00:42:53.211]  There are legitimate things we can do here in this fight.
[00:42:53.612 --> 00:42:55.333]  And speaking of that, we'll get to your calls in a moment.
[00:42:55.353 --> 00:42:56.353]  She's been holding for ten minutes.
[00:42:56.673 --> 00:42:57.594]  She brought it up during the break.
[00:42:57.634 --> 00:42:58.174]  I was talking to her.
[00:42:58.194 --> 00:43:01.516]  She said, Alex, aren't you concerned about Bush and the forced inoculation comments?
[00:43:01.556 --> 00:43:03.638]  And I'm like, yeah, I've talked about it, but Debbie, you're right.
[00:43:03.678 --> 00:43:04.778]  I need to talk about that more.
[00:43:05.299 --> 00:43:06.159]  What's wrong with me?
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.380]  I've gotten too close to this.
[00:43:08.741 --> 00:43:13.323]  And, you know, Debbie, water, if you don't have water for three days in a hot situation, you die.
[00:43:13.604 --> 00:43:14.684]  Two weeks without it, you die.
[00:43:14.704 --> 00:43:15.485]  If you're sitting still,
[00:43:16.145 --> 00:43:20.368]  You know, oxygen, water, food, and Paramount is oxygen and water.
[00:43:20.868 --> 00:43:29.273]  You guys have got made in America, preeminent gravity filters that will turn swamp water into delicious, clean drinking water.
[00:43:29.853 --> 00:43:31.434]  And Debbie, good to have you on with us.
[00:43:31.454 --> 00:43:34.376]  Hi Alex, thank you very much for having me.
[00:43:34.416 --> 00:43:44.402]  I didn't know I was going to open a can of worms when I asked you, but I was glad to hear what you had to say because when I heard it on the radio, or I think it was TV I heard it,
[00:43:44.830 --> 00:43:49.532]  That was my very first thought was, I wonder what Alex is saying about this?
[00:43:49.632 --> 00:43:55.554]  And it does get right back to, you know, protecting yourself health-wise.
[00:43:56.334 --> 00:44:04.917]  You know, protect yourself health-wise by, you know, having, you know, the best care of your body.
[00:44:04.997 --> 00:44:06.858]  And one of that is through water.
[00:44:07.138 --> 00:44:09.839]  And it is important to be hydrated.
[00:44:09.879 --> 00:44:12.580]  The more hydrated you are, the better it is.
[00:44:13.382 --> 00:44:16.003]  For your system and more you can fight off things.
[00:44:17.684 --> 00:44:23.027]  I haven't been drinking enough water for a while I was and I'm getting back to it and love the big Berkeys.
[00:44:23.047 --> 00:44:28.109]  You've got a couple specials going right now and people shouldn't procrastinate and wait till it's too late.
[00:44:28.149 --> 00:44:32.071]  They should get the Berkey and stop drinking all the poison that's in the water.
[00:44:32.771 --> 00:44:35.493]  Debbie, give us the different specials.
[00:44:35.913 --> 00:44:37.314]  Well, we have the Berkey Lights.
[00:44:38.519 --> 00:44:51.023]  For $199 with the Berkey Light without lights and you get one free gift with it and the Berkey Light with lights and you get that with two free gifts and it can be the sport bottles or the potassium iodate.
[00:44:51.103 --> 00:44:55.904]  And you have made America's stainless steel Berkey bodies with the black elements.
[00:44:56.144 --> 00:45:00.746]  Yes we do and that's our new product and it is really great.
[00:45:01.066 --> 00:45:05.087]  We have four different sizes now of Berkeys in the stainless steel.
[00:45:05.948 --> 00:45:12.274]  And you can get them with two black filters and they're expandable to add more filters and they're very reasonable.
[00:45:12.754 --> 00:45:16.798]  And you do get the sport bottles or the Tasmidate with those also.
[00:45:17.499 --> 00:45:18.459]  Which one?
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.182]  I bought two of those in the last month.
[00:45:21.202 --> 00:45:22.863]  I really like the Royal Berkey.
[00:45:22.923 --> 00:45:25.626]  It's the three and a half gallon, three and a quarter gallon.
[00:45:25.806 --> 00:45:27.488]  Three and a quarter gallon and it's only $260.
[00:45:27.608 --> 00:45:29.569]  Which one did I buy though?
[00:45:29.629 --> 00:45:30.490]  I bought the smaller one.
[00:45:31.571 --> 00:45:33.912]  You probably bought the regular Big Berkey size.
[00:45:34.532 --> 00:45:36.273]  That was $225, right?
[00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:36.973]  Right, $235.
[00:45:37.233 --> 00:45:39.995]  Okay, and by the way, those are like $300 in stores.
[00:45:40.435 --> 00:45:44.857]  Yeah, but the thing about the Royal Berkey is I like it.
[00:45:44.877 --> 00:45:52.220]  It's just a little bit bigger than the Big Berkey, but when, you know, it holds 3 1⁄4 gallons, it's perfect.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.561]  It's like the perfect size for a family.
[00:45:54.721 --> 00:45:57.082]  Especially if you want to cook with good water.
[00:45:57.322 --> 00:45:59.183]  Yes, yeah, and I do that.
[00:46:00.379 --> 00:46:05.121]  Um, I make my coffee or tea or, you know, cooked noodles, whatever.
[00:46:05.141 --> 00:46:08.863]  You use your Berkey water and it gives you that extra gallon.
[00:46:09.283 --> 00:46:11.284]  And it's really a pretty system.
[00:46:11.364 --> 00:46:15.366]  It's embossed, engraved with the Berkey logo and everything.
[00:46:15.426 --> 00:46:16.627]  It's really nice.
[00:46:16.727 --> 00:46:17.687]  No, they're beautiful.
[00:46:18.007 --> 00:46:22.309]  That's the gift I give to family that just won't for some reason stop drinking tap water.
[00:46:22.350 --> 00:46:23.130]  I just buy it and then
[00:46:27.039 --> 00:46:34.023]  Well, you know, once they start drinking with it, my brother-in-law finally got one and he started drinking with it and now that's all he does.
[00:46:34.693 --> 00:46:39.618]  They're finally realizing that I wasn't crazy when I kept telling them what a difference it made.
[00:46:39.638 --> 00:46:41.860]  Well, it's like, you know, taking the Pepsi challenge.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:45.924]  Once you've been drinking out of a luscious Berkey for a month, then try to drink tap water.
[00:46:45.964 --> 00:46:48.267]  It tastes like rancid... Oh, I know.
[00:46:48.747 --> 00:46:49.087]  I know.
[00:46:49.308 --> 00:46:50.869]  Folks, it's like somebody who drinks a lot of whiskey.
[00:46:50.889 --> 00:46:51.870]  They get accustomed to it.
[00:46:51.890 --> 00:46:53.412]  It's the same thing with drinking tap water.
[00:46:53.452 --> 00:46:56.235]  You just, you don't taste it, you know, how bad this stuff is.
[00:46:57.235 --> 00:46:58.797]  Give Debbie a call right now.
[00:46:58.857 --> 00:46:59.498]  The phones are busy.
[00:46:59.538 --> 00:47:00.759]  Leave your name and number twice.
[00:47:00.779 --> 00:47:01.600]  We'll call you right back.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:02.340]  1-888-803-4438.
[00:47:02.661 --> 00:47:05.343]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:47:05.483 --> 00:47:11.069]  Or go to Berkeywater.com.
[00:47:11.449 --> 00:47:13.271]  Tell them Alex Jones sent you to get that special.
[00:47:13.311 --> 00:47:16.233]  And tell them in the comment section what free gift you want.
[00:47:16.253 --> 00:47:18.716]  The potassium iodide in case there's a nuclear attack.
[00:47:19.076 --> 00:47:20.818]  It fills the thyroid with a good iodine.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:23.642]  You take it when there's an attack.
[00:47:24.042 --> 00:47:26.746]  The feds have all issued it to their people, but don't tell the public to get it.
[00:47:27.407 --> 00:47:29.870]  It's the medical cord type that's easy to hold down and absorb.
[00:47:29.890 --> 00:47:33.154]  They also have the shelter-in-place DVD and the sports bottles.
[00:47:33.334 --> 00:47:33.995]  Whatever you want.
[00:47:34.861 --> 00:47:36.061]  Sports bottle filters.
[00:47:36.081 --> 00:47:37.101]  Give her a call right now.
[00:47:37.121 --> 00:47:42.902]  888-803-4438 or Berkeywater.com.
[00:47:43.483 --> 00:47:44.783]  I want to thank you for coming on, Debbie.
[00:47:45.043 --> 00:47:45.863]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:47:45.983 --> 00:47:59.565]  And if there's anybody out there that had been trying to call during all the different hurricanes and I still haven't gotten back with them, if they want to call me back, I'm still trying to reach people, but keep calling me too and we will hook up.
[00:47:59.585 --> 00:48:00.406]  Alright, Debbie.
[00:48:00.426 --> 00:48:01.086]  Thanks a million.
[00:48:02.904 --> 00:48:03.304]  Take care.
[00:48:03.324 --> 00:48:05.086]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[00:48:05.166 --> 00:48:07.888]  And listen, I've been having Debbie on a little bit more than I have in the past.
[00:48:07.968 --> 00:48:09.008]  She comes on about once a week.
[00:48:09.329 --> 00:48:12.291]  I'm trying to have her on twice a week because I believe in this.
[00:48:12.371 --> 00:48:14.793]  I mean, drinking a lot of water is really good for you.
[00:48:14.833 --> 00:48:16.454]  And there's a lot of poisons in the water.
[00:48:17.194 --> 00:48:21.978]  And you're also totally dependent on the government if you don't have filtration when there's a crisis.
[00:48:22.238 --> 00:48:23.339]  And I just believe in it.
[00:48:24.145 --> 00:48:27.927]  And, uh, it's time to take action.
[00:48:27.947 --> 00:48:28.127]  888-803-4438.
[00:48:28.707 --> 00:48:30.368]  Uh, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[00:48:30.388 --> 00:48:31.168]  Thank you for holding.
[00:48:31.589 --> 00:48:35.891]  Let's go ahead and talk to, I guess, up next would be Jeff.
[00:48:37.431 --> 00:48:39.652]  Okay, John in California, then Jeff, Steve, and others.
[00:48:39.913 --> 00:48:40.513]  Go ahead, John.
[00:48:40.533 --> 00:48:41.573]  Hey, how you doing Alex?
[00:48:41.593 --> 00:48:48.116]  I just wanted to say first that everything you just said about the water, the stored food, the guns, ammo, I got them all and everyone should have them.
[00:48:48.136 --> 00:48:50.398]  Anyone that doesn't is absolutely nuts.
[00:48:50.638 --> 00:48:53.319]  But Hollywood movies say you're crazy if you're prepared.
[00:48:54.039 --> 00:48:55.100]  I don't care what they say.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:00.721]  You're supposed to live up in a big high-rise with like a one-day supply of food, totally pathetic, totally dependent on the government.
[00:49:00.982 --> 00:49:02.722]  It's bad to love America.
[00:49:02.762 --> 00:49:04.543]  It's bad to have a four-wheel drive.
[00:49:04.603 --> 00:49:07.324]  It's bad to be able to skin a buck or run a trot line.
[00:49:07.784 --> 00:49:10.605]  It's bad to be able to spit some beach nut in that dude's eye.
[00:49:10.645 --> 00:49:11.285]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[00:49:11.465 --> 00:49:12.185]  No, that's alright.
[00:49:12.205 --> 00:49:19.848]  And then exactly what you were saying about the whole SARS situation, people don't realize that tens of thousands of people a year die of the regular flu and they're
[00:49:20.288 --> 00:49:22.289]  Hyping up one or two hundred people.
[00:49:22.929 --> 00:49:25.270]  If that Diana Basar stuff, it's ridiculous.
[00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:27.350]  Fear mongering to the hilt.
[00:49:27.930 --> 00:49:30.471]  And then also on the ISP, the Roadrunner thing.
[00:49:30.751 --> 00:49:33.472]  I have Roadrunner and I went home last night, tried to get on all your sites.
[00:49:33.832 --> 00:49:34.152]  Nothing.
[00:49:34.532 --> 00:49:35.573]  Called customer service.
[00:49:36.053 --> 00:49:37.033]  The girl was really nice.
[00:49:37.093 --> 00:49:38.314]  We don't block any sites.
[00:49:38.354 --> 00:49:39.394]  We don't do any of that.
[00:49:39.754 --> 00:49:42.515]  But no, you know, I'm telling her I'm on it.
[00:49:42.595 --> 00:49:43.555]  It's not a local issue.
[00:49:43.575 --> 00:49:45.336]  She says, well, maybe it's just your computer.
[00:49:46.156 --> 00:49:48.837]  No lady, you need to look into this because it's nationwide.
[00:49:49.137 --> 00:49:49.337]  It was
[00:49:50.188 --> 00:49:50.948]  It was just ridiculous.
[00:49:51.008 --> 00:49:52.949]  I can't even believe that they're doing it.
[00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:55.730]  Well, I mean, we've talked to the right people.
[00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:57.550]  They're blocking it, and they're just saying, yeah.
[00:49:58.371 --> 00:49:58.611]  I know.
[00:49:58.991 --> 00:50:02.592]  I know, and like I said, I was checking to see if it was in my area, and sure as stuff wasn't.
[00:50:02.612 --> 00:50:10.875]  I told them, you know, as nice as I could, if this isn't fixed very soon, you'll be losing my business, and hopefully a lot more, because the only thing these people understand is money.
[00:50:11.155 --> 00:50:12.335]  I'm not exaggerating.
[00:50:12.355 --> 00:50:14.076]  I haven't counted them.
[00:50:14.216 --> 00:50:15.156]  It's hundreds, and it's like
[00:50:15.746 --> 00:50:16.207]  I don't know.
[00:50:18.028 --> 00:50:19.189]  There's masses of emails.
[00:50:19.470 --> 00:50:20.451]  Hundreds every few hours.
[00:50:20.511 --> 00:50:21.151]  Put it to you that way.
[00:50:22.052 --> 00:50:25.636]  They all need to stop Phantom and get a new ISP.
[00:50:25.716 --> 00:50:39.029]  Well George Norrie was like covering avian flu threats and new hurricanes and all these big news items and then he cuts into two or three minutes on InfoWars not being accessible.
[00:50:39.709 --> 00:50:40.170]  I don't know if
[00:50:41.028 --> 00:50:45.495]  I'm surprised it's such big news they're blocking me, but if it's on purpose, it is big news.
[00:50:45.735 --> 00:50:46.176]  That's right.
[00:50:46.196 --> 00:50:51.243]  And it's really, really scary, but I mean, they should know national radio shows without my prompting.
[00:50:51.563 --> 00:50:57.552]  This is like a big news item, and they need to fix it, and they just refuse, because they just laugh at us.
[00:50:58.372 --> 00:51:01.013]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:02.273 --> 00:51:09.656]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:09.936 --> 00:51:14.657]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:14.877 --> 00:51:20.539]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.779 --> 00:51:25.301]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.521 --> 00:51:32.684]  The taxless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.704 --> 00:51:33.485]  soil, the U.S.A.
[00:51:33.525 --> 00:51:37.226]  Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.386 --> 00:51:39.907]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[00:51:40.127 --> 00:51:46.870]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:52:53.775 --> 00:52:57.959]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:58.119 --> 00:52:59.581]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.704 --> 00:53:08.669]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.889 --> 00:53:11.152]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.332 --> 00:53:17.678]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:18.058 --> 00:53:18.658]  I think so.
[00:53:38.268 --> 00:53:38.488]  I think so.
[00:54:03.919 --> 00:54:29.397]  I hope the listeners do realize that this Time Warner censorship situation illustrates that we should all value the fact that we can go on the internet and read the government plan to carry out 9-11.
[00:54:30.956 --> 00:54:31.857]  Operation Northwoods.
[00:54:32.397 --> 00:54:35.539]  You don't think they're happy about you being able to read that declassified document, are you?
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:38.680]  No, they're not happy.
[00:54:39.081 --> 00:54:47.866]  You don't think they're happy about the fact that we can post end-to-end their lies, showing them in video clips, contradicting themselves, something TV will never do, mainstream TV.
[00:54:48.506 --> 00:54:53.649]  You think they're happy that the newspaper readership is down by 60% in the last 10 years?
[00:54:53.689 --> 00:54:59.112]  You think they're happy that cable news viewership is plunging and that the alternative web is exploding?
[00:54:59.841 --> 00:55:00.821]  No, they're panicking.
[00:55:02.302 --> 00:55:06.402]  And so they've bought up the backbone of the Internet.
[00:55:06.442 --> 00:55:08.183]  They're buying it all up with Internet 2.0.
[00:55:08.243 --> 00:55:09.343]  They're restricting it.
[00:55:09.983 --> 00:55:11.063]  And we know there's filters.
[00:55:11.123 --> 00:55:12.364]  We know that's already going on.
[00:55:12.404 --> 00:55:18.985]  But when you've got Time Warner doing it with 25 plus percent of the market, and then, admittedly, you've got all the trace routes.
[00:55:19.005 --> 00:55:19.725]  You've got the evidence.
[00:55:19.745 --> 00:55:21.466]  Their own IT people go, yeah, there's a block.
[00:55:22.086 --> 00:55:25.847]  But we're not going to do anything about it, really.
[00:55:26.747 --> 00:55:27.707]  You know, that's what's happening.
[00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:29.920]  And it illustrates.
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:32.822]  I mean, think about what this network has had to do just to be on the radio.
[00:55:34.103 --> 00:55:44.271]  You know, before we even try to get AM and FM stations to pick us up, we have to line up programs, put hosts on the air from all over the country, get them dialed in with the central hub in Minneapolis-St.
[00:55:44.291 --> 00:55:55.360]  Paul, connect with the satellites, lease those satellites, then have those satellites hooked up correctly, send that out, have the tones and the music and the ads all prepared properly.
[00:55:56.323 --> 00:56:00.985]  Then the battle begins to get AM and FM stations to pick us up so we can just tell the truth.
[00:56:03.467 --> 00:56:06.008]  Then there's selling the advertisers to pay for all of it.
[00:56:06.048 --> 00:56:08.129]  You know, it's not an easy task.
[00:56:08.569 --> 00:56:11.271]  This information doesn't just come to you.
[00:56:14.032 --> 00:56:17.554]  And that's why it's important to... I always value the Internet.
[00:56:17.634 --> 00:56:20.135]  I value when I hear a local talk show host telling the truth.
[00:56:20.195 --> 00:56:21.636]  I go, wow, that's really special.
[00:56:22.196 --> 00:56:22.817]  That's a gemstone.
[00:56:25.310 --> 00:56:34.697]  That's why it's so sad to see so many of the other so-called patriots on other networks and places, who are just going telepro, descending into attacking and savaging other people that are trying to do a good job.
[00:56:34.737 --> 00:56:36.178]  But that's their job!
[00:56:36.799 --> 00:56:37.699]  To tear down.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.402]  Because the globalists are desperate.
[00:56:41.142 --> 00:56:43.484]  They know we're hurting them, and we're having an effect.
[00:56:43.524 --> 00:56:45.245]  We're ringing the alarm bell.
[00:56:45.305 --> 00:56:46.686]  We're warning people.
[00:56:48.728 --> 00:56:51.350]  But we have a multifaceted, multivariate attack.
[00:56:53.214 --> 00:56:55.896]  We're on cable TV around the country through AXS television.
[00:56:56.096 --> 00:56:56.857]  Big audiences.
[00:56:57.017 --> 00:56:57.818]  Hundreds of stations.
[00:56:57.878 --> 00:56:59.499]  Hundreds of people that put us on.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:02.881]  Reaching millions of potential viewers.
[00:57:03.902 --> 00:57:05.363]  We are on AM and FM.
[00:57:06.844 --> 00:57:07.425]  Old school.
[00:57:08.325 --> 00:57:14.630]  We are... We have listeners all over the country that make copies of the shows on CD and give them to people.
[00:57:15.150 --> 00:57:19.794]  We also make the documentary films, which are the key in our fight.
[00:57:20.347 --> 00:57:24.251]  Because they're high quality, they're well produced, they're focused, they wake people up.
[00:57:24.752 --> 00:57:25.753]  It's just, it's incredible.
[00:57:26.374 --> 00:57:28.616]  Martial Law, my new film, is my best work.
[00:57:28.997 --> 00:57:30.258]  It needs to be seen.
[00:57:30.638 --> 00:57:31.820]  People need to have it.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.922]  If you've got a copy, make copies.
[00:57:33.942 --> 00:57:35.904]  If you haven't gotten it, get Martial Law.
[00:57:36.224 --> 00:57:37.586]  Get 9-11 and the Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:37.846 --> 00:57:38.767]  Make copies of them.
[00:57:38.787 --> 00:57:39.388]  Get them out.
[00:57:41.201 --> 00:57:43.682]  The Globalist can't stop you from doing that, not yet!
[00:57:44.103 --> 00:57:44.483]  Do it!
[00:57:44.563 --> 00:57:45.383]  It's effective!
[00:57:45.623 --> 00:57:46.344]  Use the tools!
[00:57:46.384 --> 00:57:47.284]  We know it works!
[00:57:47.744 --> 00:57:50.486]  Call right now and get the videos, even if you can't get online right now.
[00:57:50.506 --> 00:57:52.027]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:52.047 --> 00:57:53.808]  Don't let them stop the information.
[00:57:53.828 --> 00:57:53.888]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:53.908 --> 00:57:55.649]  Find out what they're so afraid of.
[00:58:07.434 --> 00:58:17.659]  888-253-3139, or if you've got a different service, go to InfoWars.com and order them via the safe, secure, online shopping cart.
[00:58:19.079 --> 00:58:23.581]  And our shopping cart's on a secure Yahoo system, so it's not down for people that have time warners.
[00:58:23.601 --> 00:58:27.263]  You can just type in Alex Jones Shopping Cart, and you'll get that, even if you can't get to our website.
[00:58:27.583 --> 00:58:29.564]  So please get the videos, get them out to people.
[00:58:30.194 --> 00:58:38.037]  By the way, I'll be showing my new remastered Dark Secrets coming up this Sunday at the Alamo Draft House and on Monday at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar.
[00:58:38.397 --> 00:58:38.737]  Be there.
[00:58:38.757 --> 00:58:39.338]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:41.758 --> 00:58:45.980]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.571 --> 00:58:58.212]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.872 --> 00:58:59.952]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.652 --> 00:59:01.792]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.412 --> 00:59:03.233]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.973 --> 00:59:04.973]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.553 --> 00:59:09.514]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.734 --> 00:59:13.815]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.729 --> 00:59:26.310]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:26.350 --> 00:59:28.872]  We are now into our number two.
[00:59:28.992 --> 00:59:30.714]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:59:31.274 --> 00:59:33.896]  Wide open phones today, taking a ton of your phone calls.
[00:59:33.916 --> 00:59:40.020]  And I'm going to blast through them right now, and then I'm going to get into the killer flu of 1918 caused by bird virus.
[00:59:40.541 --> 00:59:43.143]  And the government created synthetic 1918 flu.
[00:59:43.323 --> 00:59:43.503]  Oh!
[00:59:44.344 --> 00:59:45.464]  Now I'm sure it'll pop up.
[00:59:46.365 --> 00:59:50.308]  We'll get into all these spies in the White House, spies here, there, everywhere.
[00:59:50.368 --> 00:59:51.529]  I mean, that's the tip of the iceberg.
[00:59:53.293 --> 00:59:56.214]  Just a lot more coming up in this hour.
[00:59:57.274 --> 00:59:58.814]  Plus, what's happening with the economy.
[00:59:59.634 --> 01:00:00.835]  And that's really getting scary.
[01:00:00.875 --> 01:00:01.735]  We will talk about it.
[01:00:02.135 --> 01:00:04.515]  Right now, let's clear these calls out.
[01:00:05.056 --> 01:00:09.276]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff in New York and Steve, Justin, Ian, Dina, and others.
[01:00:09.496 --> 01:00:10.297]  Go ahead, Jeff.
[01:00:10.317 --> 01:00:10.857]  You're on the air.
[01:00:11.197 --> 01:00:12.097]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[01:00:13.697 --> 01:00:13.997]  Welcome.
[01:00:15.098 --> 01:00:21.919]  A few months ago, two months ago, I started a public access show on Time Warner Cable in Syracuse, New York.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.002]  The show is called Expose and Defeat Tyranny.
[01:00:25.723 --> 01:00:27.384]  It airs from 4 p.m.
[01:00:27.444 --> 01:00:28.225]  to 6 p.m.
[01:00:28.265 --> 01:00:29.065]  on Thursdays.
[01:00:29.145 --> 01:00:30.226]  It's going to be on tonight.
[01:00:31.047 --> 01:00:37.112]  And what I've been showing since it's been on has been your shows, Martial Law and 9-11 Road to Tyranny.
[01:00:39.102 --> 01:00:41.144]  You know, again, I mentioned this in the last segment.
[01:00:41.164 --> 01:00:42.145]  I didn't know you were there.
[01:00:42.165 --> 01:00:45.469]  I didn't know, you know, that a listener who's doing this was on the line.
[01:00:45.909 --> 01:00:53.838]  But literally hundreds of producers around the country are putting my documentaries on, and other documentaries, and of course doing their own shows, which I think is even better.
[01:00:54.819 --> 01:00:56.561]  And it's having a huge effect.
[01:00:56.621 --> 01:00:57.121]  Good job.
[01:00:57.942 --> 01:00:58.222]  It is.
[01:00:58.623 --> 01:01:00.104]  Alex, your videos are great.
[01:01:01.075 --> 01:01:05.758]  I wanted to ask you if it's alright to use other stuff that you have on your website on the show.
[01:01:06.099 --> 01:01:07.700]  Anything you want, sir!
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.021]  Great, that's great.
[01:01:09.781 --> 01:01:17.066]  Listen, at the end of the takeover, I say, make copies of these videos, put them on AXS TV, here's your authorization.
[01:01:18.247 --> 01:01:23.591]  You have a really good interview you did with Cindy Sheehan on your website, and I wanted to put that on the show, too.
[01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:25.592]  Sir, you put whatever you want on.
[01:01:25.652 --> 01:01:26.953]  Don't ever ask me permission.
[01:01:27.013 --> 01:01:27.894]  Attack the enemy!
[01:01:28.570 --> 01:01:29.230]  That's fantastic.
[01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:32.672]  Use their propaganda conduit to attack their own forces.
[01:01:32.692 --> 01:01:34.293]  That's great.
[01:01:34.473 --> 01:01:37.115]  We're seizing control of their own mechanisms.
[01:01:37.135 --> 01:01:37.915]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:01:38.235 --> 01:01:43.458]  It is the double-edged sword of technology, and we can wield it against them just as they can wield it on us.
[01:01:43.999 --> 01:01:51.063]  And again, we have the truth, so a grain of truth, literally, is like a grain of antimatter, you know, hitting a ball of uranium.
[01:01:51.123 --> 01:01:54.545]  It just explodes with the power of a thousand hydrogen bombs.
[01:01:55.245 --> 01:01:56.746]  It's great when you can confront
[01:01:57.592 --> 01:02:04.215]  The people who still believe the false paradigm and watch their faces as you just bombard them with fact after fact.
[01:02:04.455 --> 01:02:06.316]  And a lot of that we've gotten from you, Alex.
[01:02:06.876 --> 01:02:07.496]  They melt.
[01:02:07.676 --> 01:02:09.977]  I know, I found the pounding is the way to do it.
[01:02:10.197 --> 01:02:11.458]  Just throwing it in their face.
[01:02:11.718 --> 01:02:12.698]  And stuff they already knew.
[01:02:12.738 --> 01:02:13.899]  See, they already know all of it.
[01:02:14.079 --> 01:02:15.219]  They never linked it together.
[01:02:15.259 --> 01:02:17.020]  So we just bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:19.081]  And you're the master of that.
[01:02:19.441 --> 01:02:23.004]  Well, I mean, I haven't studied it, but I have researched it a little bit.
[01:02:23.404 --> 01:02:25.865]  It's kind of what the occult de-programmers do.
[01:02:26.226 --> 01:02:29.408]  So when they get a cult member who's been brainwashed, it's like de-brainwashing.
[01:02:29.848 --> 01:02:35.712]  And really, you just flash, you know, you show them the lies of their original programmer.
[01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.653]  You use their own tactics against them.
[01:02:40.616 --> 01:02:42.518]  It's almost, really it's the opposite of that.
[01:02:43.258 --> 01:02:50.665]  Whereas, I don't know how to explain it, but I don't even try to consciously do it, it's like an organic deprogramming.
[01:02:51.006 --> 01:02:57.572]  What we do, I just organically do this, naturally, not that I'm even good at it, but the truth is the truth is the truth.
[01:02:58.573 --> 01:02:59.514]  It will set you free.
[01:03:01.395 --> 01:03:05.039]  Absolutely, the people perish for lack of knowledge, where did I hear that before?
[01:03:06.946 --> 01:03:08.227]  What else is on your mind, my friend?
[01:03:08.607 --> 01:03:16.172]  A history channel and Discovery, these guys, they're showing a lot of stuff trying to counteract your videos, like you were saying in the first segment.
[01:03:16.613 --> 01:03:20.916]  Last night they had Nazis in the occult where they just touched on the Thule Society.
[01:03:21.556 --> 01:03:23.898]  And maybe you can talk about the new video you're working on.
[01:03:23.918 --> 01:03:27.340]  I thought I heard you mention that you're going to go into depth on these things.
[01:03:28.191 --> 01:03:30.833]  A little bit more, yeah.
[01:03:30.953 --> 01:03:32.795]  It's called The Order of Death.
[01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:40.820]  A little 35-minute, really hard-hitting, and it's going to be offered with, on the same CD, the Bohemian Rove video.
[01:03:41.261 --> 01:03:42.221]  We're going to beat him, Alex.
[01:03:42.321 --> 01:03:43.122]  We don't have a choice.
[01:03:43.662 --> 01:03:44.383]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:03:44.423 --> 01:03:44.843]  Keep it up.
[01:03:45.483 --> 01:03:45.944]  Keep it up.
[01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:49.566]  We'll be showing that, by the way, coming up this Sunday.
[01:03:50.067 --> 01:03:51.127]  And Monday, here in Austin.
[01:03:51.288 --> 01:03:51.728]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.477 --> 01:03:57.359]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.599 --> 01:03:59.180]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:04.183]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.524 --> 01:04:11.248]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.588 --> 01:04:13.570]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:13.770 --> 01:04:16.632]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.732 --> 01:04:21.375]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.596 --> 01:04:25.999]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.239 --> 01:04:33.444]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.705 --> 01:04:36.126]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[01:04:36.287 --> 01:04:38.028]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:04:38.148 --> 01:04:44.170]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:51.153]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:04:53.587 --> 01:04:56.868]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.908 --> 01:05:01.089]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:01.350 --> 01:05:04.130]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:04.331 --> 01:05:06.731]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.931 --> 01:05:15.554]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.754 --> 01:05:17.115]  The Berkey light is different.
[01:05:17.295 --> 01:05:21.476]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.796 --> 01:05:22.557]  We're good to go!
[01:05:40.799 --> 01:05:42.440]  Screams and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:42.661 --> 01:05:45.503]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:45.523 --> 01:05:46.464]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:54.304 --> 01:06:02.228]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[01:06:02.788 --> 01:06:04.109]  What happened to those prices?
[01:06:04.649 --> 01:06:06.370]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:13.913]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[01:06:14.373 --> 01:06:14.913]  The result?
[01:06:15.334 --> 01:06:16.614]  Inflation was born.
[01:06:17.114 --> 01:06:19.175]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[01:06:21.158 --> 01:06:22.042]  What can you do about it?
[01:06:22.484 --> 01:06:24.796]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[01:06:25.612 --> 01:06:30.955]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:36.558]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[01:06:36.998 --> 01:06:39.499]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[01:06:39.899 --> 01:06:41.620]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:44.422]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now!
[01:06:53.047 --> 01:06:58.091]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.471 --> 01:07:00.793]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:01.074 --> 01:07:15.507]  Yes, we know that Time Warner Cable and AOL are blocking anyone nationwide from getting to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:07:17.228 --> 01:07:22.849]  As well as ArnoldExposed.com and a bunch of others, but you can get to InfoWars.net.
[01:07:23.530 --> 01:07:26.730]  And we have tracerouted it from all over the country directly to Time Warner.
[01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:28.071]  There is simply a block on there.
[01:07:28.471 --> 01:07:37.013]  We don't know if it's an accident or on purpose, but we've talked to their mid-level, not just low-level IT people, and they're just, okay, there's a block, but whatever.
[01:07:38.113 --> 01:07:39.854]  And it is directly their fault.
[01:07:40.234 --> 01:07:41.054]  It is not our fault.
[01:07:41.921 --> 01:07:44.363]  And, uh, you know, everybody can call in and talk about it.
[01:07:44.383 --> 01:07:45.984]  People are freaking out about it all over the country.
[01:07:46.004 --> 01:07:47.064]  I didn't know it would be this big of a deal.
[01:07:47.524 --> 01:07:54.869]  It's actually kind of heartening that people instinctively know this is an attack on free speech, an attack on the free flow of info, and people already have experienced it.
[01:07:55.129 --> 01:08:04.695]  We've confirmed that libraries all over the country, when I've called and talked to librarians, and they say, you're in our filtering software, you're listed as a hate site, or as a hacking site.
[01:08:05.835 --> 01:08:10.138]  And, uh, again, these filters, they have porn, gambling, hate,
[01:08:11.008 --> 01:08:11.649]  And hacking.
[01:08:12.369 --> 01:08:13.670]  Those are the things they filter for.
[01:08:14.231 --> 01:08:18.674]  Pick your grab bag, some of these filter softwares that have been loaded onto these machines.
[01:08:19.635 --> 01:08:21.657]  It's, you know, we're listed as hate or hacking.
[01:08:22.037 --> 01:08:23.798]  There's nothing about hacking on our websites.
[01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:27.902]  We'll post a wired news story about hacking, you know, reporting on it.
[01:08:28.602 --> 01:08:36.769]  And I guess if you're against killing black African children with AIDS virus laced injections, then you're hateful.
[01:08:37.435 --> 01:08:41.356]  If you're against radiating small Jewish children, 100,000 of them, then you're hateful.
[01:08:42.496 --> 01:08:45.737]  If you expose Nazi occultism, you will be attacked by the ADL.
[01:08:45.877 --> 01:08:48.098]  I don't know why, but they do.
[01:08:48.118 --> 01:08:49.418]  I mean, this is just the rule.
[01:08:50.138 --> 01:08:55.800]  You can dance around with a white hood on your head and not much is going to be said about you, but if you fight Nazism, you will be attacked.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.381]  I'm not joking, by the way.
[01:08:58.401 --> 01:08:59.161]  That's serious.
[01:08:59.201 --> 01:09:00.101]  You've experienced it.
[01:09:00.141 --> 01:09:00.701]  You've seen it.
[01:09:01.121 --> 01:09:01.561]  You know it.
[01:09:04.888 --> 01:09:10.132]  This does coincide with the big Jewish World Review or whatever attacking me.
[01:09:11.473 --> 01:09:20.179]  Just because I had Galloway on talking about Haratz and Jerusalem Post where they admit they've been caught, Israel's been caught creating fake Al-Qaeda groups and carrying out bombings.
[01:09:20.219 --> 01:09:22.881]  I mean, it's in the Jerusalem Post, am I not supposed to talk about it?
[01:09:22.901 --> 01:09:27.364]  I mean, they just caught SAS carrying out terror attacks over in Basra.
[01:09:27.424 --> 01:09:28.605]  I mean, caught red-handed, BBC.
[01:09:29.634 --> 01:09:30.695]  Am I bad for that?
[01:09:32.116 --> 01:09:33.717]  But see, we put it all in one place.
[01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:34.717]  We point it out.
[01:09:35.778 --> 01:09:37.019]  And it's just hurting them.
[01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:38.079]  We're hurting them too bad.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:47.105]  And all over the place, college dorms, colleges, universities, churches, you cannot get to our websites.
[01:09:47.405 --> 01:09:49.447]  And you know, you can't put out every fire.
[01:09:50.287 --> 01:09:57.812]  For some reason, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com are becoming some of the most censored and attacked websites.
[01:09:59.486 --> 01:10:03.408]  And you've got to ask yourselves why.
[01:10:03.428 --> 01:10:07.831]  We've got to say thank God for WWCR, not just our AM and FM stations.
[01:10:08.131 --> 01:10:11.353]  You can still go out and buy a high-quality Sanjean or Grundig radio.
[01:10:11.373 --> 01:10:15.935]  I mean, you can buy Grundig radios, pretty high-quality wind-up ones now, for like $50.
[01:10:17.456 --> 01:10:18.497]  Sanjean went out of business.
[01:10:18.557 --> 01:10:20.438]  You can find them online really cheap, really nice.
[01:10:20.478 --> 01:10:21.318]  I just bought two of them.
[01:10:21.338 --> 01:10:22.359]  I already had one of them.
[01:10:22.379 --> 01:10:23.419]  They're just so good.
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.541]  Part of our emergency preparedness.
[01:10:26.696 --> 01:10:30.117]  By the way, during the day we're at 9.985, the first two hours.
[01:10:30.137 --> 01:10:32.037]  Then we're at 9.975, the third hour.
[01:10:32.397 --> 01:10:34.118]  At night, new frequencies, folks!
[01:10:34.698 --> 01:10:35.298]  First hour, 7.461.
[01:10:35.358 --> 01:10:36.098]  Second and third hours, 5.765.
[01:10:36.158 --> 01:10:39.099]  Starting at the end of October, all three hours at 5.765.
[01:10:39.139 --> 01:10:40.279]  We're simulcasting right now.
[01:10:40.319 --> 01:10:43.820]  We're still on 3210, but starting in a few weeks, you'll only be able to hear us
[01:10:56.124 --> 01:11:09.259]  At night on these even better frequencies, it's my opinion they are, of 5.765 for the second two hours, and of course the first hour at 7.461, but starting in a few weeks, 5.765 all three hours.
[01:11:14.714 --> 01:11:16.556]  We really appreciate WWCR.
[01:11:16.596 --> 01:11:17.857]  We told them we wanted a different frequency.
[01:11:17.897 --> 01:11:18.497]  Because see, 3210 is great!
[01:11:18.517 --> 01:11:20.539]  You know, if you're in Timbuktu.
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.561]  But in some areas, the U.S.
[01:11:22.601 --> 01:11:23.162]  is not the best.
[01:11:23.622 --> 01:11:25.944]  So we are switching to that, and they have really helped us.
[01:11:26.585 --> 01:11:29.087]  And we've worked with a lot of the other shortwave providers.
[01:11:29.107 --> 01:11:36.033]  Let me tell you, WWCR for service, for professionalism, for all-out cooking power.
[01:11:36.413 --> 01:11:37.734]  Really giving you the 100,000 watts they claim.
[01:11:39.488 --> 01:11:40.289]  I mean, we've metered it.
[01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:42.671]  It's right at 100,000 watts.
[01:11:42.711 --> 01:11:48.055]  They are the premier private shortwave facility in the world after things like the BBC.
[01:11:49.716 --> 01:11:51.838]  So, we salute WWCR.
[01:11:51.878 --> 01:11:53.860]  They're just so good at being with them.
[01:11:54.060 --> 01:12:01.486]  I never really thank the people out there that deserve to be thanked, but all of them over there, terrific job.
[01:12:01.526 --> 01:12:04.308]  Some of the loons we've been with in the past, it has not been fun.
[01:12:05.309 --> 01:12:08.852]  Okay, let's go ahead
[01:12:09.987 --> 01:12:12.328]  And let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:12:12.348 --> 01:12:13.829]  I'm going to just accelerate through them.
[01:12:14.349 --> 01:12:15.709]  I really am taking a lot of calls today.
[01:12:15.729 --> 01:12:17.830]  I'm proud of myself and we're going to plunge into the news.
[01:12:18.470 --> 01:12:21.151]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Pennsylvania.
[01:12:21.171 --> 01:12:22.172]  Steve, welcome.
[01:12:22.972 --> 01:12:23.932]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:12:24.072 --> 01:12:27.614]  I hope this conversation with you will save, like, several million lives.
[01:12:28.114 --> 01:12:29.274]  I'm a ham operator.
[01:12:29.334 --> 01:12:32.556]  I'm also a past member of the American Society of Safety Engineers.
[01:12:33.316 --> 01:12:39.038]  I fully disagree with you on how big this bird flu is going to get, but I don't want to argue about it.
[01:12:39.745 --> 01:12:42.106]  Uh, what I'm telling you is that our government made the flu.
[01:12:42.286 --> 01:12:46.708]  Our troops, uh, if you have a son or daughter over in Iraq, they're probably going to survive the flu.
[01:12:47.108 --> 01:12:51.530]  There is an antidote, but a lot of us are going to die before the antidote comes out.
[01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:52.990]  What I want to talk about is BPL.
[01:12:53.070 --> 01:12:55.932]  You really think the government's vaccine is the antidote?
[01:12:56.652 --> 01:12:59.313]  I, no, not the one that don't give the average people.
[01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:05.335]  What they're going to do is wait until the, uh, third flu hits the east and west coast, because that'll wipe out most of the people in the United States.
[01:13:05.355 --> 01:13:06.476]  Then they'll bring out the real thing.
[01:13:06.986 --> 01:13:08.707]  And save the people in the heartland.
[01:13:09.147 --> 01:13:11.028]  But that's not what I want to talk about.
[01:13:11.048 --> 01:13:12.528]  So you really think they're going to do it?
[01:13:12.729 --> 01:13:13.329]  Yes, they are.
[01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:13.949]  I know they are.
[01:13:14.009 --> 01:13:15.030]  I know for a fact they are.
[01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:15.450]  Now listen.
[01:13:15.630 --> 01:13:17.651]  How do you know that?
[01:13:18.151 --> 01:13:23.713]  You have a first class envelope coming to your Texas address.
[01:13:24.334 --> 01:13:25.354]  It should be there today.
[01:13:25.914 --> 01:13:27.535]  Alright, I'll read it.
[01:13:27.615 --> 01:13:29.216]  Give me a little bit of detail.
[01:13:29.236 --> 01:13:29.976]  Sir, sir, hold on.
[01:13:30.456 --> 01:13:31.557]  Come on, you make that claim.
[01:13:31.897 --> 01:13:32.837]  Just elaborate on it.
[01:13:34.884 --> 01:13:37.965]  It's all elaborated in the booklet that I sent you.
[01:13:37.985 --> 01:13:40.326]  You need to do it now.
[01:13:40.346 --> 01:13:40.646]  Pictures?
[01:13:40.706 --> 01:13:41.247]  Alright.
[01:13:41.627 --> 01:13:43.147]  It's a government plot.
[01:13:43.187 --> 01:13:44.088]  There are people out.
[01:13:44.168 --> 01:13:46.109]  This is a war against Christianity.
[01:13:47.629 --> 01:13:56.473]  The guy that told me about it, he's involved with the skull and bones and stuff, and he said, look, we're scientists, we're not Christians.
[01:13:57.119 --> 01:14:00.903]  You guys made us live in a Christian world for the last 2,000 years.
[01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:02.644]  Now the tables are going to turn.
[01:14:02.664 --> 01:14:06.207]  Scientists are going to rule the world, and you're going to be eliminated.
[01:14:06.267 --> 01:14:08.209]  If you want to pray, you're going to have to pray in your house.
[01:14:08.249 --> 01:14:10.651]  And if we catch you praying in your house, you're going to work camp.
[01:14:11.532 --> 01:14:13.654]  Hey, you guys, you're exactly on the money.
[01:14:13.694 --> 01:14:15.376]  Why do you think they're trying to shut you down?
[01:14:15.736 --> 01:14:17.238]  Why do you think they're trying to shut you down?
[01:14:17.258 --> 01:14:19.460]  Now listen, do you know anything about BPL?
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:20.761]  Because you can check into this.
[01:14:20.821 --> 01:14:22.042]  BPL, have you ever heard of it?
[01:14:22.794 --> 01:14:23.375]  Oh, why don't you?
[01:14:23.435 --> 01:14:24.737]  I know several BPLs.
[01:14:24.897 --> 01:14:25.718]  Okay, BPL.
[01:14:25.758 --> 01:14:27.881]  It's called Broadband Over Power Line.
[01:14:28.101 --> 01:14:28.622]  Oh, of course.
[01:14:28.702 --> 01:14:28.822]  Yeah.
[01:14:28.842 --> 01:14:31.165]  Okay, I'm a member of Hammer Radio Operator.
[01:14:31.185 --> 01:14:32.367]  That's flying shortwave.
[01:14:32.467 --> 01:14:35.471]  This month, QST Magazine has an article in.
[01:14:35.491 --> 01:14:39.356]  They're going to start two systems up in Texas, or they tried to start two up.
[01:14:39.457 --> 01:14:40.398]  One in Castroville.
[01:14:41.058 --> 01:14:42.058]  They turned it down.
[01:14:42.179 --> 01:14:47.181]  But the one plutonium mayor, Lori Berger, who called the $200,000... Well, let me stop you.
[01:14:47.221 --> 01:14:54.264]  I mean, obviously, you know more about this than I do, but even the National Ham Radio Association's president, he lives in, what, Fort Worth?
[01:14:54.644 --> 01:14:58.946]  They've gone public when they turn these on, and even Fry's AM Radio.
[01:14:59.526 --> 01:15:00.027]  Yeah, I know.
[01:15:00.547 --> 01:15:03.448]  But what it is, is they're coming out with this bird flu.
[01:15:03.468 --> 01:15:09.151]  They're going to put us in quarantines, and they're going to tell you, don't travel from Austin to another town.
[01:15:09.838 --> 01:15:11.218]  Stay within your area.
[01:15:11.298 --> 01:15:15.980]  And when people don't listen, they're going to be traveling along these VPL lines.
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:24.082]  And we already know, we already know for a fact, that if you go that close to the VPL line, that your radio isn't going to work.
[01:15:25.523 --> 01:15:27.563]  Communications worldwide is going to be shut down.
[01:15:27.603 --> 01:15:29.924]  They have 40 of these test sites in the United States.
[01:15:30.384 --> 01:15:31.885]  There's another 20 overseas.
[01:15:32.125 --> 01:15:36.686]  For those who don't know, they haven't put the switches in yet to reroute them around power sites, though.
[01:15:37.461 --> 01:15:53.076]  Well, anyway, what I'm trying to say is, okay, if these are irradiating, uh, uh, uh, knocking out the, uh, very low VHF frequencies and the HF frequencies, uh, if people don't think there's anything to worry about with this, all you need is more power.
[01:15:53.116 --> 01:15:54.717]  It's just like your station, Alex.
[01:15:54.837 --> 01:15:56.739]  You're putting out probably 50,000 watts.
[01:15:57.179 --> 01:16:02.124]  I'll give you, I'll give you 20 bucks if you go up on the tower and hang on to that antenna while you transmit.
[01:16:03.035 --> 01:16:03.715]  You want to try that?
[01:16:04.116 --> 01:16:09.139]  The only thing that stops you from putting out more than 50,000 watts is the fact that you don't have enough foliage.
[01:16:09.639 --> 01:16:11.780]  But where the hell are they tying these things to?
[01:16:12.180 --> 01:16:15.903]  They're tying them to the biggest electric grid in the United States.
[01:16:16.603 --> 01:16:19.185]  They're going to fry people for 15 miles away.
[01:16:19.925 --> 01:16:23.567]  There's one down here along the Pennsylvania Turnpike in Monroeville.
[01:16:24.067 --> 01:16:29.171]  It's where Dick Cheney, there's an article in the paper, Dick Cheney used to come up claiming to shoot 200
[01:16:34.945 --> 01:16:39.749]  I don't know how good your shoulder is, but I know I've never gone through a box of shotgun shells.
[01:16:40.225 --> 01:16:43.908]  I mean, my shoulder's worn out after pulling the trigger 10 or 20 times.
[01:16:44.048 --> 01:16:47.570]  How can Cheney be pulling the trigger 200 times on a weekend?
[01:16:47.630 --> 01:16:51.173]  How does that tie into the end of the mass slaughter of Christians?
[01:16:51.313 --> 01:16:54.395]  Okay, what they're doing is they have a bird farm down in Monroeville.
[01:16:54.595 --> 01:16:57.037]  And when they turn this on, they will have it on for a while.
[01:16:57.077 --> 01:16:58.038]  They aren't testing it.
[01:16:58.178 --> 01:17:00.139]  I mean, to actually fry people.
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:02.021]  But they're not frying the people, they're frying the birds.
[01:17:02.041 --> 01:17:03.362]  All right, I'm gonna have to check into this.
[01:17:03.562 --> 01:17:04.603]  I appreciate it.
[01:17:04.623 --> 01:17:06.264]  Let me give you just a little more information.
[01:17:07.984 --> 01:17:18.931]  At press time, the Texas Governor, Rich Perry, was mulling whether to sign Senate Bill 5, SB 5 legislation that promotes and encourages BPL in the Lone Star State.
[01:17:19.912 --> 01:17:21.753]  So there you go, buddy.
[01:17:21.833 --> 01:17:31.699]  Just find a ham operator who's a member of the ARRL, that's the American Radio Relay League, have them go into News and Bulletins and just check back.
[01:17:31.739 --> 01:17:33.540]  It's called the AR... Yeah, I know about it.
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.081]  Listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:39.900]  A year from now, nothing's happened.
[01:17:40.801 --> 01:17:41.501]  Nobody'll care.
[01:17:41.541 --> 01:17:43.141]  There'll be all these new stories.
[01:17:45.222 --> 01:17:47.422]  Look, I'm not saying that nothing's going to happen.
[01:17:49.063 --> 01:17:50.343]  It'll be what you don't expect.
[01:17:50.403 --> 01:17:52.984]  It'll be a nuke going off, or a biological, or a chemical.
[01:17:53.844 --> 01:17:55.124]  And it'll be the globalists doing it.
[01:17:55.164 --> 01:17:55.604]  We know that.
[01:17:55.644 --> 01:17:57.365]  We've caught them a hundred times, they'll do it again.
[01:17:57.385 --> 01:17:59.065]  This is how they get their control.
[01:17:59.145 --> 01:18:03.566]  As long as they know that we'll go along with their orders, when they carry out crises, they'll keep doing it.
[01:18:03.926 --> 01:18:05.927]  But they're ratcheting them up slowly.
[01:18:07.472 --> 01:18:15.038]  And just to say that, you know, data over power lines, broadcast over power lines, you know, that they can fry us and kill us with all of them.
[01:18:16.079 --> 01:18:18.901]  I mean, the transformers from point to point can't take that load.
[01:18:19.742 --> 01:18:21.523]  And I'm not even an electrician, I know that.
[01:18:21.624 --> 01:18:22.544]  So see, right there.
[01:18:23.405 --> 01:18:32.772]  And obviously, sir, you know, you know all about ham radio stuff, but I mean, I'm not going to sit here and get off into, you know, just... It's amazing.
[01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:34.374]  And I talk about what I can prove.
[01:18:34.434 --> 01:18:35.355]  That's all I do.
[01:18:35.735 --> 01:18:37.036]  That's all I've ever done.
[01:18:37.865 --> 01:18:40.529]  Now, I said I'd go quickly through your calls, and he went on for about eight minutes.
[01:18:41.730 --> 01:18:46.777]  But, uh, because I asked him to, we'll come back and take some more, but... Just a... Look.
[01:18:48.099 --> 01:18:50.502]  We know they're hyping the bird flu, okay?
[01:18:50.582 --> 01:18:51.103]  It's that simple.
[01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:58.975]  Did you know there is an easy and inexpensive way for you to look and feel better in less than 30 days?
[01:18:59.115 --> 01:19:05.179]  You can lose excess weight, have more energy, sleep better, and be mentally on top of your game without even trying.
[01:19:05.259 --> 01:19:08.901]  This is not about vitamins or the latest nutritional wonder product.
[01:19:08.921 --> 01:19:10.082]  We've all had enough of those.
[01:19:10.382 --> 01:19:13.104]  I'm talking about God's pure, whole food.
[01:19:13.144 --> 01:19:15.947]  When you consume them, you look and feel better automatically.
[01:19:16.047 --> 01:19:22.172]  And thanks to URI International, you don't have to endure tasteless food or the expense and hassle of juicing.
[01:19:22.312 --> 01:19:32.320]  Using biblical farming standards and 21st century technology, URI grows, harvests, and prepares God's whole foods in pure powder form to protect and lock in their nutrients.
[01:19:32.520 --> 01:19:38.765]  URI ships its powder from the farm right to your doorstep, so you can conveniently consume it either in delicious drinks
[01:19:38.985 --> 01:19:39.606]  We're good to go.
[01:19:54.036 --> 01:19:57.000]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:06.211]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:20:06.531 --> 01:20:11.217]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:20:11.677 --> 01:20:18.399]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:20:18.799 --> 01:20:30.582]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:20:31.042 --> 01:20:35.505]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:20:35.685 --> 01:20:38.006]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:20:38.026 --> 01:20:39.987]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:20:40.007 --> 01:20:41.208]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:20:41.268 --> 01:20:42.748]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:20:42.768 --> 01:20:43.809]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:20:54.855 --> 01:20:56.016]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:20:56.416 --> 01:21:01.900]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:02.980]  That's right.
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:05.582]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[01:21:05.902 --> 01:21:13.067]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[01:21:13.627 --> 01:21:21.314]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:21:21.754 --> 01:21:26.619]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[01:21:27.239 --> 01:21:30.262]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:33.024 --> 01:21:37.189]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[01:21:37.549 --> 01:21:37.809]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:37.829 --> 01:21:39.751]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[01:21:39.812 --> 01:21:40.132]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:21:40.432 --> 01:21:40.692]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.160 --> 01:21:56.542]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:21:56.782 --> 01:21:57.122]  Why?
[01:21:57.443 --> 01:22:00.084]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[01:22:39.460 --> 01:22:40.600]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.180]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:23:03.357 --> 01:23:16.403]  We've got a pretty clear picture of how the globalists operate and I appreciate that caller calling in with his opinions and his views and a lot of facts that he was bringing forward to the table.
[01:23:17.644 --> 01:23:24.167]  And yeah, this data transfer over power lines is already screwing up shortwave and AM and FM.
[01:23:25.127 --> 01:23:29.069]  I mean, instead of driving under a power line and suddenly the big AM station in town cuts out,
[01:23:29.796 --> 01:23:33.559]  Now, just the am station won't come in or it's got horrible static all over it.
[01:23:34.479 --> 01:23:37.502]  A mile from the transmitter when they do this data transfer.
[01:23:39.323 --> 01:23:43.126]  Basically streaming data through the electricity and then they broadcast it.
[01:23:43.766 --> 01:23:45.127]  Electricity broadcast.
[01:23:47.289 --> 01:23:50.791]  I don't, you know, have all the technical details, but we know what it does.
[01:23:51.391 --> 01:23:54.894]  And I mean, major broadcasting associations are against it.
[01:23:55.998 --> 01:24:00.261]  The major AM broadcasting association is screaming bloody murder.
[01:24:00.301 --> 01:24:04.763]  It's not like it's Alex Jones over here claiming that it's doing this.
[01:24:04.863 --> 01:24:05.683]  It's horrible!
[01:24:06.544 --> 01:24:08.105]  So of course Rick Perry's going to do it.
[01:24:09.686 --> 01:24:10.466]  Of course he is.
[01:24:11.527 --> 01:24:12.807]  I mean, you want open borders?
[01:24:12.887 --> 01:24:16.749]  You want toll roads on every major street?
[01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:18.670]  6,000 miles of them?
[01:24:18.991 --> 01:24:19.691]  7,000 in the whole country?
[01:24:20.672 --> 01:24:22.012]  You want all this stuff?
[01:24:22.052 --> 01:24:23.313]  I mean, that's Rick Perry, baby!
[01:24:24.511 --> 01:24:28.152]  And yes, I'm aware that it's going on in Dallas and other areas, and it is really bad news.
[01:24:28.792 --> 01:24:38.936]  But to just say they can turn it up on high and fry everybody, I know enough about how electricity works and that a lot of our lines can't even take the power that's going over them now.
[01:24:39.496 --> 01:24:43.637]  They tried to do that, those things would blow up, it'd be like explosions all over.
[01:24:45.158 --> 01:24:46.838]  Then there'd be nothing traveling down them.
[01:24:46.878 --> 01:24:49.619]  So, you know, you really lost me there.
[01:24:49.699 --> 01:24:51.680]  Maybe I'm ignorant and just don't see it.
[01:24:52.856 --> 01:24:53.937]  Look, this is one I know.
[01:24:54.217 --> 01:24:58.040]  And I've been meaning to make a documentary about this for years, but I never really get around to it.
[01:24:58.060 --> 01:25:03.204]  I mean, I've mentioned it in some of the films, but... Maybe I'll make a mini-doc about it.
[01:25:03.224 --> 01:25:04.485]  That's on the back burner.
[01:25:05.326 --> 01:25:07.528]  But the open moves for population control.
[01:25:09.329 --> 01:25:16.575]  I mean, we have the declassified documents, we have the public plans from Australia, the UK, the US, as far back as 56.
[01:25:17.536 --> 01:25:24.942]  Oh, we're going to ship contaminated grain with a chemical weapon or a biological weapon that will sterilize all the Asians.
[01:25:28.285 --> 01:25:33.249]  I mean, you look at America and these women who, quote, have these special birth controls and they're basically all sterilized.
[01:25:33.449 --> 01:25:37.713]  I mean, you know, now the fertility is way down in men and women.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:41.461]  The sperm count is down 80-something percent in the U.S., even higher in Europe.
[01:25:42.021 --> 01:25:48.002]  I mean, finding a man who can get a woman pregnant in a few decades is going to be a big deal.
[01:25:49.583 --> 01:25:58.044]  Women out there are going to be searching for a man who's still got the potential to pass on the genetics.
[01:25:58.544 --> 01:25:59.845]  And the same thing is happening to women.
[01:26:01.105 --> 01:26:05.306]  And we've caught the United Nations scores of times in India, in Africa,
[01:26:06.059 --> 01:26:15.144]  In Latin America and in the US, adding a very expensive synthetic hormone, that has nothing to do with the production of the tetanus, into the pathogen.
[01:26:15.984 --> 01:26:24.528]  So the body has an autoimmune response, not just to the tetanus, that it knows to recognize, but also to that hormone, which is used in bringing a baby to term.
[01:26:24.548 --> 01:26:33.793]  So it's a horrible form of sterilization, because the women actually conceive, then in around three months, over and over again, 100% kill rate, abort the baby.
[01:26:34.981 --> 01:26:35.581]  A miscarriage.
[01:26:35.621 --> 01:26:40.564]  I mean, it's just... And in third world conditions, a lot of times that causes serious illnesses in the women.
[01:26:41.985 --> 01:26:47.568]  It's also the same shot's been linked to a bunch of other problems.
[01:26:47.628 --> 01:26:48.649]  Endometriosis.
[01:26:51.411 --> 01:26:53.672]  So it's not fun.
[01:26:53.692 --> 01:26:59.035]  For those that don't know what endometriosis is, it is the little cellular growths that
[01:26:59.887 --> 01:27:01.248]  Go in at the end of each month.
[01:27:01.288 --> 01:27:03.690]  I don't mean to get in too much detail here, but you know what they're doing to you.
[01:27:04.250 --> 01:27:09.514]  And removes the cell wall that was going to be for the fertilized egg to grow in.
[01:27:10.014 --> 01:27:13.937]  They're the little worker bees that basically eat all that away.
[01:27:15.077 --> 01:27:22.202]  Those get turned loose in the woman's uterus and her fallopian tubes and then basically have lunch on their ovaries.
[01:27:23.963 --> 01:27:27.906]  All specially designed, little friendly thing the government does for women.
[01:27:28.915 --> 01:27:31.597]  And, uh, so you can, I guess, thank the government for all of that.
[01:27:33.758 --> 01:27:34.498]  They've been caught!
[01:27:34.638 --> 01:27:35.318]  You understand?
[01:27:35.398 --> 01:27:35.679]  Caught!
[01:27:35.739 --> 01:27:47.485]  Henry Kissinger, in the 73 document, declassified in 91, and this is on our website, this is declassified, said, to the third world, you want IMF and World Bank money, you gotta sterilize half your women by hook or crook.
[01:27:48.365 --> 01:27:49.806]  And by the way, here's the vaccine maker.
[01:27:51.367 --> 01:27:53.108]  You understand, this is not our opinion.
[01:27:53.449 --> 01:27:59.113]  So to say they may release deadly flu on us and kill us is... I mean, this is a real threat.
[01:27:59.153 --> 01:28:05.237]  It's like if a serial killer has killed a bunch before, and we're just saying, hey, don't get in the car with him.
[01:28:06.638 --> 01:28:08.039]  The chance is he's going to kill you.
[01:28:09.280 --> 01:28:11.361]  That's why I'm so angry and in such horror.
[01:28:11.922 --> 01:28:17.846]  I mean, we literally have people that see us as animals, and the caller was right about that, that literally see us as dog meat.
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.342]  And who think that we're here to be enslaved and killed.
[01:28:21.382 --> 01:28:23.484]  They see us lower than cattle.
[01:28:23.624 --> 01:28:29.629]  You know, a cow and a squeeze shoot at a slaughterhouse when the gas hammer knocks its brains out.
[01:28:30.729 --> 01:28:35.333]  So, I mean, they see you as animals, and they're sitting there laughing at you, and they openly say they're gonna kill you.
[01:28:35.853 --> 01:28:37.134]  So we gotta take that serious.
[01:28:37.234 --> 01:28:37.895]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[01:28:38.535 --> 01:28:39.916]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:28:39.937 --> 01:28:40.417]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.820 --> 01:28:44.760]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.201 --> 01:28:46.702]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.697 --> 01:28:50.459]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.781 --> 01:28:56.163]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:56.403 --> 01:29:00.246]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:29:00.566 --> 01:29:01.386]  Read the labels.
[01:29:01.807 --> 01:29:05.929]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:10.352]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:10.713 --> 01:29:15.596]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:15.976 --> 01:29:19.561]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my Cal Bend Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:19.741 --> 01:29:25.088]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:25.368 --> 01:29:28.111]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:28.392 --> 01:29:29.293]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:29.593 --> 01:29:30.154]  Call now!

[01:29:53.286 --> 01:29:56.307]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:56.607 --> 01:30:01.549]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.789 --> 01:30:06.150]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:15.353]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[01:30:19.474 --> 01:30:24.521]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:31.490]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:32.661]  What about you?

[01:30:54.946 --> 01:30:57.830]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[01:30:58.030 --> 01:31:03.416]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[01:31:03.656 --> 01:31:05.178]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:31:05.218 --> 01:31:07.461]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:31:07.661 --> 01:31:11.145]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:31:11.525 --> 01:31:13.546]  And they can do it without due process.
[01:31:13.627 --> 01:31:17.069]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries.
[01:31:17.209 --> 01:31:20.531]  And now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[01:31:20.732 --> 01:31:26.436]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[01:31:26.716 --> 01:31:34.121]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property or make it look like you own no property and a whole lot more.
[01:31:34.141 --> 01:31:34.561]  We're good.
[01:31:56.559 --> 01:31:57.019]  Don't worry.
[01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.060]  This show is documented.
[01:31:59.561 --> 01:32:02.362]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:02.722 --> 01:32:06.264]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:32:06.684 --> 01:32:10.806]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:32:11.387 --> 01:32:13.268]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:32:13.588 --> 01:32:15.649]  The ring of fire.
[01:32:16.509 --> 01:32:17.850]  The ring of fire.
[01:32:17.870 --> 01:32:19.391]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:32:19.631 --> 01:32:20.931]  Yeah, there's something wrong with it.
[01:32:20.951 --> 01:32:23.793]  You can't press somebody that doesn't like Johnny Cash.
[01:32:24.482 --> 01:32:26.504]  I tell ya, I need to play some of that on there.
[01:32:43.602 --> 01:32:47.844]  I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dinin' car.
[01:32:48.244 --> 01:32:52.607]  They're probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars.
[01:32:52.987 --> 01:32:58.129]  But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die.
[01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.090]  Alright, I'll stop torturing you.
[01:33:03.352 --> 01:33:06.294]  I bet there's rich folks eatin' in a fancy dinin' car.
[01:33:07.154 --> 01:33:10.656]  They're probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars.
[01:33:11.295 --> 01:33:16.417]  I tell ya, that sounds pretty good, but I limit myself to one cup of coffee a day and no cigars!
[01:33:16.477 --> 01:33:17.357]  No more cigars.
[01:33:17.817 --> 01:33:18.317]  Zero.
[01:33:18.377 --> 01:33:18.957]  Detotaler.
[01:33:20.098 --> 01:33:22.939]  Absolutely not a zip on the tobacco product.
[01:33:23.719 --> 01:33:25.519]  So many times I've started smoking a cigar.
[01:33:25.619 --> 01:33:27.320]  Oh, I'll just have one.
[01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.380]  I go fishing once every couple months.
[01:33:29.501 --> 01:33:31.401]  I'll just have one cigar.
[01:33:32.061 --> 01:33:34.062]  And then all of a sudden I'm buying a pack of cigarettes.
[01:33:35.106 --> 01:33:41.069]  Alright, I've got life-shattering, earth-shattering news to cover, and I'm babbling about Johnny Cash and cigars.
[01:33:41.129 --> 01:33:48.754]  It just sounds fun, being in a fancy dining car, drinking luscious coffee and smoking big, fat, juicy cigars.
[01:33:48.794 --> 01:33:52.756]  I mean, I've just... That's of the flesh, though.
[01:33:53.256 --> 01:33:54.757]  I like the simple pleasures, folks.
[01:33:55.718 --> 01:33:57.699]  But, uh... Alright, that's enough.
[01:34:00.656 --> 01:34:02.538]  Oh, man, I'd love to just go deep sea fishing.
[01:34:02.638 --> 01:34:03.419]  I don't ever have time.
[01:34:03.459 --> 01:34:04.700]  I don't get to have any fun.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:08.002]  All work and no play doesn't make Jack a dull boy, though.
[01:34:08.022 --> 01:34:12.206]  It makes him aggressive and, quite frankly, a maniac.
[01:34:12.386 --> 01:34:15.128]  But here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:16.049 --> 01:34:29.720]  We're about to go back to your calls in the news, but the point I was making before we went to break is that we have an ocean, a plethora, a deep, dark sea, a fathomless oceanic pit,
[01:34:31.321 --> 01:34:45.404]  Of the government saying they want to kill 85% of us, saying they want to sterilize us, saying they want to reduce our population, saying they're going to do it with food and water control and energy control, but namely through vaccines.
[01:34:47.124 --> 01:34:52.686]  So when I sit up here and say, don't take the vaccines, I mean, I got government documents saying they're going to contaminate you with them.
[01:34:52.766 --> 01:34:55.126]  I mean, we post them, they're on the website.
[01:34:55.166 --> 01:34:57.226]  Oh, I'm sorry, you can't go there.
[01:34:57.607 --> 01:34:59.627]  25% of the country has been blocked by Time Warner.
[01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:03.023]  Just get another service if you have to, or do whatever.
[01:35:03.063 --> 01:35:03.963]  The point is, it's out there.
[01:35:05.004 --> 01:35:08.227]  But the globalists are killing us.
[01:35:08.267 --> 01:35:09.548]  They are attacking us.
[01:35:09.568 --> 01:35:15.573]  But they don't like big, giant, theatrical events with their bio-attacks I've seen in the past.
[01:35:15.873 --> 01:35:16.894]  Maybe they're going to change that.
[01:35:16.934 --> 01:35:24.861]  Maybe they are going to release some super-souped-up flu and kill a bunch of people and train us to take forced inoculations and train us to go into compact cities.
[01:35:25.081 --> 01:35:26.022]  I mean, that may happen.
[01:35:26.062 --> 01:35:26.963]  Stuff's really heating up.
[01:35:27.003 --> 01:35:27.683]  I got a bad feeling.
[01:35:28.324 --> 01:35:29.385]  Okay, that could be.
[01:35:32.188 --> 01:35:41.235]  But I tend to agree with Rappaport and many others that have looked at this for years, and boy, he's been right on, that it is hype and that it is a trainage to be slaves.
[01:35:41.875 --> 01:35:46.799]  They'll probably use a chemical weapon and claim it's biological because they don't really want to release something they can get too out of control.
[01:35:47.059 --> 01:35:53.904]  Plus, even some of the worst bioweapons don't spread that well in our modern society because of the way we live.
[01:35:55.926 --> 01:35:58.127]  Frankly, you know, the average household doesn't have fleas.
[01:35:58.568 --> 01:35:59.608]  The average household 300 years ago did.
[01:36:00.891 --> 01:36:04.914]  I mean, the style for like a hundred years in France and England was dark brown.
[01:36:05.574 --> 01:36:06.335]  Why was it dark brown?
[01:36:06.355 --> 01:36:07.976]  Because so many fleas were on you.
[01:36:08.276 --> 01:36:10.978]  They had dogs because they believed that the fleas would jump on them.
[01:36:10.998 --> 01:36:12.419]  It actually just made it worse.
[01:36:13.139 --> 01:36:15.861]  It's like they thought having pots of water stopped mosquitoes.
[01:36:17.142 --> 01:36:18.783]  When they were building the Panama Canal.
[01:36:19.564 --> 01:36:20.844]  Guess why the French couldn't do it?
[01:36:20.864 --> 01:36:21.465]  They had to pull out.
[01:36:21.525 --> 01:36:24.267]  And finally, America's figured out, no, the mosquitoes are breeding in there.
[01:36:24.307 --> 01:36:26.668]  But the ignorance of man is unbelievable.
[01:36:26.688 --> 01:36:28.049]  And we're ignorant.
[01:36:28.069 --> 01:36:30.091]  We've got to stop being ignorant and learn more.
[01:36:32.421 --> 01:36:34.663]  Bottom line, they like creeping death.
[01:36:35.444 --> 01:36:39.607]  I mean, how many African countries have 45%, 35%?
[01:36:42.469 --> 01:36:48.274]  Most African countries, and in Central Africa and even Southern Africa, I mean, it's as high as 45% have HIV.
[01:36:51.857 --> 01:36:57.661]  And, uh, but it's funny, somebody else gets HIV, if they're Magic Johnson or somebody else, oh, they're going to be just fine forever.
[01:36:59.603 --> 01:37:00.864]  But then other people die from it.
[01:37:01.351 --> 01:37:03.271]  There's a whole debate about what's really causing it.
[01:37:03.892 --> 01:37:17.154]  We believe that it is simply a carrier or connected to another microplasm, and this is what top scientists are saying, that actually is causing that, but only if you have an impaired immune system, you have a problem if you're Caucasian.
[01:37:17.514 --> 01:37:29.257]  It is clearly more... I mean, they've done studies where blacks and Hispanics, especially blacks, who are as sexually active as whites, in the same circles, the whites don't get it.
[01:37:29.297 --> 01:37:31.137]  I mean, clearly something's going on there.
[01:37:32.648 --> 01:37:33.849]  That's just the statistics.
[01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:36.451]  But, I mean, forget all that!
[01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:39.534]  I mean, we've got Nobel Prize winners saying that's what it is and going public right now.
[01:37:39.874 --> 01:37:40.895]  But forget that!
[01:37:41.835 --> 01:37:51.363]  We have them fought adding chemicals, hormones, to the pathogens in the tetanus shot, red-handed.
[01:37:52.604 --> 01:38:00.630]  And the payoff to the host country is, the president, or his minister, or his wife, this is the same all over Africa, all over Latin America, they own the vaccine company.
[01:38:00.670 --> 01:38:01.291]  That's the payoff.
[01:38:02.009 --> 01:38:08.612]  And then this expensive synthetic hormone showed up in 103 manufacturers.
[01:38:09.072 --> 01:38:10.773]  See, the UN got caught adding this hormone.
[01:38:10.793 --> 01:38:11.674]  They said, oh, it's an accident.
[01:38:11.694 --> 01:38:16.996]  They said, well, actually, epidemiologists and virologists and vaccine producers and experts have looked at this.
[01:38:17.316 --> 01:38:18.097]  This shouldn't be in there.
[01:38:18.117 --> 01:38:20.578]  It isn't anywhere in the chain of production.
[01:38:20.998 --> 01:38:23.219]  Then they started testing the lots from all over the world.
[01:38:23.639 --> 01:38:24.360]  They all had it.
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:25.901]  All of them.
[01:38:27.061 --> 01:38:28.722]  That's red-handed!
[01:38:29.532 --> 01:38:30.692]  Red-handed!
[01:38:30.932 --> 01:38:32.313]  That's one case!
[01:38:33.433 --> 01:38:46.797]  And then we have the Kissinger documents saying, a commission he had for the CIA, and the report, and only thirty-something pages are declassified, it's over a thousand pages that we know of, but they won't release those, and the stuff they declassify!
[01:38:47.457 --> 01:38:52.379]  It says, you will sterilize half your women, by any means necessary, or no IMF or World Bank money.
[01:38:53.239 --> 01:38:57.380]  I mean, we have the Australian government, in 1956, saying you will sterilize.
[01:38:59.258 --> 01:39:00.099]  We have all this.
[01:39:00.539 --> 01:39:02.000]  Then we have the dropping sperm counts.
[01:39:02.040 --> 01:39:04.442]  We have all these new female problems women are having.
[01:39:04.702 --> 01:39:09.626]  The incredible increase in zero fertility, or reduced fertility.
[01:39:10.967 --> 01:39:19.233]  We have this host of things going on, and it's as obvious as the nose on my face.
[01:39:19.253 --> 01:39:21.114]  I mean, red handed.
[01:39:21.354 --> 01:39:22.295]  Not debatable.
[01:39:23.621 --> 01:39:25.041]  But they like creeping death.
[01:39:25.101 --> 01:39:29.622]  They like just, oh there's all these new diseases and people are dying left and right all over the third world.
[01:39:30.102 --> 01:39:33.383]  I mean, there are African countries where they've had like 10 million people die of AIDS.
[01:39:35.944 --> 01:39:39.504]  And 45% of the population has it and they're dying all over the place.
[01:39:43.825 --> 01:39:44.666]  I mean, it's a nightmare.
[01:39:46.986 --> 01:39:47.646]  It's a nightmare.
[01:39:50.247 --> 01:39:51.607]  And it's saddening.
[01:39:53.377 --> 01:39:57.738]  And it's going on right in front of them, and we even read UN documents where they say they're doing it and this is a plan.
[01:39:58.338 --> 01:40:13.321]  And then, the problem is people that talk about it shoot their mouths off, never post the documents, just say, I heard there's a plan, and they're gonna put it in the serial, and you know, they got satellites that shoot out devil rays at us.
[01:40:13.641 --> 01:40:14.001]  No!
[01:40:15.661 --> 01:40:20.562]  It's on record what they're doing and how they're doing it, and they tend, when they're really doing a bio-attack on you,
[01:40:22.133 --> 01:40:29.194]  When they're really launching a bio-attack on you, they do it and don't even announce it.
[01:40:30.835 --> 01:40:31.555]  Here's an example.
[01:40:31.615 --> 01:40:38.956]  We've got, a decade ago, you'd have maybe 7 to 15 cases of leprosy.
[01:40:38.996 --> 01:40:40.577]  These national numbers came out a year.
[01:40:40.597 --> 01:40:41.817]  7,000 cases last year.
[01:40:41.837 --> 01:40:42.477]  7,000 reported cases.
[01:40:49.358 --> 01:40:50.921]  Now I'm not saying that's a government plot.
[01:40:51.061 --> 01:40:51.962]  It's just they don't care.
[01:40:52.323 --> 01:40:53.685]  They can keep that quiet.
[01:40:54.787 --> 01:40:56.710]  How many people know there's lepers all over Austin?
[01:40:56.891 --> 01:40:58.473]  The numbers are much higher than that.
[01:40:58.914 --> 01:40:59.816]  That's 7,000 confirmed.
[01:41:00.076 --> 01:41:02.380]  You think the illegal aliens just march in and get treatment for it?
[01:41:06.448 --> 01:41:12.732]  And there's just tens of thousands every month of drug-resistant and drug-immune TB and deaths being caused by it.
[01:41:13.033 --> 01:41:15.715]  And they put those little illegal aliens right next to your kid in school.
[01:41:15.915 --> 01:41:16.695]  They don't say a word.
[01:41:16.735 --> 01:41:17.336]  They don't care.
[01:41:17.516 --> 01:41:22.659]  But, oh, we've got to inject you with a bunch of vaccines because we love you for stuff that isn't you.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:26.662]  We've got to give your newborn a hepatitis shot when it's no reason to take it.
[01:41:26.682 --> 01:41:30.265]  It's for IV drug users and those who are sexually permissive.
[01:41:30.445 --> 01:41:32.106]  And by the way, it's one of the most deadly vaccines.
[01:41:34.964 --> 01:41:39.187]  Drugs insert, the inoculations only insert, says it's very dangerous.
[01:41:39.607 --> 01:41:45.271]  Japan's banned giving vaccines under the age of two, but they're running around here trying to make hundreds of them mandatory.
[01:41:45.491 --> 01:41:50.294]  It's already up to 45 and by mandatory quote they say you have to take it until you know your rights and say no.
[01:41:50.534 --> 01:41:51.495]  They even lie about that.
[01:41:54.397 --> 01:42:02.462]  So, you know, you're a doctor driving along your red face right now going, that Alex Jones, I'm a doctor, how dare him say our profession would do something like that.
[01:42:03.740 --> 01:42:08.622]  You know, that's like when I say Tony Blair is a terrorist, and I get emails going, don't you talk bad about the British people.
[01:42:09.382 --> 01:42:17.506]  I'm not saying you're a bad doctor, because you're a good person, you think the world's all hunky-dory, and everything's fine and sweet and lovey-dovey.
[01:42:17.826 --> 01:42:19.107]  That is not how it works!
[01:42:19.927 --> 01:42:28.791]  And so don't sit there and say that they didn't put it in the vaccines, and don't say that they didn't have sterilization plans, and don't sit there and tell me that it isn't true before you haven't checked it out!
[01:42:30.752 --> 01:42:31.732]  What I'm telling you is true!
[01:42:34.890 --> 01:42:38.453]  And literally, I've come across hundreds of red-handed instances of it.
[01:42:40.455 --> 01:42:42.397]  And I keep meaning to build a whole section on the site.
[01:42:42.417 --> 01:42:44.759]  For some reason, I've made that request over and over again.
[01:42:45.299 --> 01:42:49.263]  We need to write a whole article about population control and how it ties into bird flu.
[01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:53.167]  Because, you know, SARS is going to kill you.
[01:42:53.247 --> 01:42:56.690]  Three years ago, the swine flu, this new one, is going to kill everybody.
[01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:59.072]  Coming out of South Korea.
[01:42:59.745 --> 01:43:03.187]  Oh my gosh, this duck flu, I remember six years ago, it's going to kill everyone.
[01:43:03.607 --> 01:43:13.292]  And now it's SARS, and now it's bird flu, and now it's... And we just feed into this fear when they can't even confirm it's killed 65 people.
[01:43:13.512 --> 01:43:20.255]  When you hear that this new bird flu has killed 65 people, then when you really read the medical information, they go, well, they think it did.
[01:43:20.275 --> 01:43:27.519]  They think they did.
[01:43:30.066 --> 01:43:45.554]  Oh my gosh, 30,000 people die a year of flu every year in this country, and we should beef up our immune systems, and yeah, there are vitamins and products that help, and that's wonderful, but just to sit there and go, the Earth is destroyed, and the troops save me, martial law.
[01:43:46.314 --> 01:43:48.495]  And two weeks ago, it's because of the hurricane, we need martial law.
[01:43:48.775 --> 01:43:50.716]  Every day, the President's talking about martial law.
[01:43:51.377 --> 01:43:52.057]  That's what it is.
[01:43:55.199 --> 01:43:56.880]  And so many people feed into this.
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.580]  I mean, I hear it.
[01:43:58.881 --> 01:43:59.641]  And, you know,
[01:44:00.589 --> 01:44:03.291]  It's not good for freedom to just pile on to this fear-mongering.
[01:44:04.131 --> 01:44:06.533]  You endanger the entire free society by doing it.
[01:44:09.555 --> 01:44:11.436]  And we get discredited over time.
[01:44:11.536 --> 01:44:13.738]  Just constantly, you know, fear-mongering.
[01:44:13.798 --> 01:44:17.641]  Planet X is going to get us.
[01:44:17.681 --> 01:44:19.102]  The devil comet is going to get us.
[01:44:19.122 --> 01:44:20.122]  I mean, the Vulcan comet.
[01:44:20.502 --> 01:44:22.704]  And if I hear any more of this, I'm going to pull my hair out, folks.
[01:44:23.525 --> 01:44:23.785]  No.
[01:44:24.065 --> 01:44:27.047]  Let's talk about the real stuff that's going on.
[01:44:29.352 --> 01:44:32.193]  You know, let's stick to the sodium stannous fluoride.
[01:44:32.213 --> 01:44:33.373]  Let's stick to aspartame.
[01:44:33.614 --> 01:44:38.675]  Let's stick to the 40-plus known viruses in many different major vaccines.
[01:44:39.196 --> 01:44:41.556]  Let's stick to what MSG does to you.
[01:44:41.737 --> 01:44:44.237]  I mean, you might as well go start taking arsenic.
[01:44:44.778 --> 01:44:45.158]  Literally.
[01:44:45.838 --> 01:44:51.060]  Let's talk about how it's in 10,000-plus foods now, and they don't even label it now.
[01:44:51.835 --> 01:45:04.081]  I mean, let's talk about how they're putting genetic-engineered cross-species genes into foods, and how it openly is pure poison, because it creates amino acids that never existed before.
[01:45:06.442 --> 01:45:11.865]  I mean, let's talk about chimeras, humanzes they've got in Argentina.
[01:45:14.716 --> 01:45:17.778]  Let's talk about how they got cross-species arachnid goats.
[01:45:17.858 --> 01:45:24.542]  I mean, let's talk about how they're cloning humans and how New Jersey passed a law they could bring a clone to term and keep it and use it for body parts.
[01:45:24.942 --> 01:45:25.323]  Passed!
[01:45:25.523 --> 01:45:26.964]  The average person doesn't even know that!
[01:45:31.166 --> 01:45:34.228]  Let's talk about the fact there are building death camps all over this country.
[01:45:34.288 --> 01:45:41.833]  I mean, let's stick to the real stuff instead of jumping on the government bandwagon that the bird flu is going to kill every one of us in five minutes.
[01:45:44.341 --> 01:45:47.403]  Because what they'll do is they'll fly over and spray some nerve gas with a drone.
[01:45:47.423 --> 01:45:49.864]  20 people in the government will know about it.
[01:45:49.904 --> 01:45:51.085]  Private contractors will do it.
[01:45:51.545 --> 01:45:52.686]  Bunch of people will get sick.
[01:45:52.706 --> 01:45:53.946]  It'll be a slow-acting chemical.
[01:45:54.887 --> 01:46:00.070]  They'll call in a Fed who holds up a digital still of the virus on TV.
[01:46:00.230 --> 01:46:03.532]  All the hysteria will be in and they'll just train us how to be slaves.
[01:46:03.812 --> 01:46:09.275]  And then you're not going to worry about how they're looting the Treasury because you're worried about the bird flu getting.
[01:46:10.415 --> 01:46:11.396]  The possum flu getting.
[01:46:15.228 --> 01:46:17.330]  I mean, they're running bio-attacks on us right now.
[01:46:18.431 --> 01:46:19.732]  They're not going to fear-monger that.
[01:46:20.472 --> 01:46:21.253]  That's their attack.
[01:46:21.673 --> 01:46:23.515]  They're not telling you what their attack is.
[01:46:23.815 --> 01:46:26.397]  They're putting out these red herrings, pun intended.
[01:46:27.038 --> 01:46:32.302]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:46:33.163 --> 01:46:34.564]  Let's talk to Justin in Michigan.
[01:46:34.604 --> 01:46:35.245]  Justin, go ahead.
[01:46:35.265 --> 01:46:35.785]  Thanks for holding.
[01:46:37.186 --> 01:46:40.008]  I've got some news here on this internet outage for you.
[01:46:40.689 --> 01:46:42.090]  It's not really directed at you.
[01:46:43.231 --> 01:46:44.152]  What's happened is there's
[01:46:44.795 --> 01:46:48.456]  Both companies that run the whole thing and they have to talk to each other.
[01:46:48.596 --> 01:46:49.577]  I know about Bolero.
[01:46:50.617 --> 01:46:51.598]  That's Level 3.
[01:46:51.858 --> 01:46:52.498]  That's not it.
[01:46:52.558 --> 01:46:53.698]  We've already checked all that.
[01:46:53.918 --> 01:46:58.260]  It's Patriot sites predominantly and it's directly in Time Warner.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:47:04.302]  It's a dual problem and they're using that as a... Look, we've had now like four IT people look at this.
[01:47:04.742 --> 01:47:06.683]  Well, it's all over the news right now.
[01:47:07.203 --> 01:47:08.624]  Cogent and Level 3 aren't talking.
[01:47:09.324 --> 01:47:11.265]  Three out of your four websites are on Cogent's network.
[01:47:12.327 --> 01:47:13.127]  And I'm all bound.
[01:47:13.307 --> 01:47:14.928]  Last night, I'm a cogent customer.
[01:47:14.968 --> 01:47:21.131]  I couldn't get to blogger.com because of the way the routing tables were at the time.
[01:47:21.231 --> 01:47:23.932]  Look, sir, what I'm telling you is we looked at the routing tables.
[01:47:24.092 --> 01:47:26.093]  And I'm not the web person.
[01:47:26.133 --> 01:47:26.994]  It's been looked at.
[01:47:28.114 --> 01:47:31.436]  At the same time, I talked about this yesterday.
[01:47:32.825 --> 01:47:40.827]  At the same time, they have gone in and they have flipped some type of switch inside Time Warner that's also blocking us.
[01:47:41.087 --> 01:47:44.748]  We're even doing it on networks that aren't part of that network and we can't go to it.
[01:47:45.048 --> 01:47:50.049]  And we look at who people can't, the sites that can't be gone to, it is predominantly alternative news sites.
[01:47:51.149 --> 01:47:51.369]  Right.
[01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:53.990]  Well, that's the hosting contract that you're dealing with there.
[01:47:55.210 --> 01:47:58.771]  A properly set up site will be on multiple backbones, which means people can still get to you.
[01:47:58.991 --> 01:47:59.391]  No, I know.
[01:47:59.431 --> 01:48:01.612]  Multiple DNS numbers on multiple servers.
[01:48:02.017 --> 01:48:04.058]  Well, I'm looking at it and it looks a lot different.
[01:48:04.158 --> 01:48:06.119]  There's a few hundred people out there that agree.
[01:48:07.240 --> 01:48:08.501]  So, just saying.
[01:48:08.561 --> 01:48:09.201]  Well, no, I know.
[01:48:09.261 --> 01:48:11.302]  I understand it's on the news what's going on.
[01:48:12.783 --> 01:48:13.884]  We talked about it yesterday.
[01:48:14.684 --> 01:48:18.246]  Yeah, I didn't catch that yesterday, but I'm looking at it and I think it's different.
[01:48:18.606 --> 01:48:19.827]  You know, explain this to me.
[01:48:21.548 --> 01:48:22.889]  Why was the Drudge Report down?
[01:48:24.670 --> 01:48:25.711]  Why was the Drudge Report down?
[01:48:26.071 --> 01:48:29.673]  Yeah, and then CNN is on some of the same systems and they're not down.
[01:48:30.593 --> 01:48:31.634]  They're probably multi-homed.
[01:48:32.105 --> 01:48:33.426]  Yeah, but so was the Drudge Report.
[01:48:33.886 --> 01:48:35.607]  Well, routing tables were off for a while.
[01:48:36.328 --> 01:48:39.089]  I'm guessing the techs working on Drudge Report fudged the tables.
[01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:42.971]  What's happened is BGP Routing's been shut down by Cogent and Level 3.
[01:48:43.012 --> 01:48:44.713]  They're playing games with each other.
[01:48:45.533 --> 01:48:46.053]  Exactly!
[01:48:46.113 --> 01:48:46.774]  It's games!
[01:48:46.914 --> 01:48:49.756]  Well, yeah, but it's just corporate bickering.
[01:48:49.776 --> 01:48:50.656]  There's no conspiracy here.
[01:48:51.336 --> 01:48:51.797]  I don't know.
[01:48:52.057 --> 01:48:54.318]  You see, while this is going on, that's what I just said.
[01:48:54.578 --> 01:48:55.979]  There's two things going on.
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:00.442]  We've got these internet problems
[01:49:01.388 --> 01:49:01.908]  With the net.
[01:49:02.449 --> 01:49:04.069]  And then we've also got Time Warner.
[01:49:04.409 --> 01:49:05.330]  I haven't talked about it.
[01:49:05.950 --> 01:49:07.791]  This has been going on for six months.
[01:49:08.732 --> 01:49:09.072]  Okay?
[01:49:09.172 --> 01:49:11.773]  Time Warner filtering us, blocking us.
[01:49:11.813 --> 01:49:12.834]  We've caught them over and over again.
[01:49:12.854 --> 01:49:14.074]  Every time we call, they fix it.
[01:49:14.634 --> 01:49:17.536]  And so it's that same problem nested inside of this other one.
[01:49:17.556 --> 01:49:21.578]  I don't know if you were listening earlier, but I've already talked about it.
[01:49:21.958 --> 01:49:22.378]  Yeah, I know.
[01:49:22.418 --> 01:49:24.299]  I thought I'd call in and try it.
[01:49:24.359 --> 01:49:27.721]  Look, I believe you that that's the predominant problem.
[01:49:29.878 --> 01:49:30.879]  So what do we do about it?
[01:49:30.939 --> 01:49:33.002]  I mean, just create alternative DNS's?
[01:49:33.502 --> 01:49:34.623]  Well no, you gotta get multi-homed.
[01:49:36.706 --> 01:49:38.167]  That way no one person can track you down.
[01:49:39.408 --> 01:49:43.893]  Yeah, well we've got servers on other, that's right, Infowars.net's up there, and one of the other sides.
[01:49:43.993 --> 01:49:45.395]  Yeah, that's it, on AT&T.
[01:49:45.775 --> 01:49:45.955]  Yeah.
[01:49:46.816 --> 01:49:49.519]  Thank you for, I'll tell you what, Stan, let me talk to you during the break, find out some more.
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:50.901]  See if it's the same info I've got.
[01:49:53.627 --> 01:49:55.149]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.329 --> 01:49:58.413]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.553 --> 01:50:02.458]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.498 --> 01:50:06.743]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:50:07.103 --> 01:50:10.868]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.008 --> 01:50:12.810]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:12.990 --> 01:50:16.252]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.332 --> 01:50:21.034]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.194 --> 01:50:24.256]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.416 --> 01:50:27.317]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.778 --> 01:50:33.901]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.421 --> 01:50:38.226]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:50:38.626 --> 01:50:40.008]  Order your video today.

[01:50:53.732 --> 01:50:56.716]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.076 --> 01:51:05.906]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.226 --> 01:51:10.912]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.352 --> 01:51:18.075]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.475 --> 01:51:30.261]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:30.741 --> 01:51:35.185]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:52:42.389 --> 01:52:48.252]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives in education.
[01:53:01.713 --> 01:53:11.517]  We know for a fact that filtering software all over the country, in universities and in libraries, blocks, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:53:14.078 --> 01:53:17.259]  And we know about the whole problem on the net.
[01:53:17.299 --> 01:53:21.241]  Two companies, and it is in the news, I have one of the reports here, are fighting with each other.
[01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:25.223]  So again, it is fighting over markets and all of this.
[01:53:25.243 --> 01:53:31.165]  But we know that in the middle of all this, and I understand Time Warner is routing through them and we're routing through it,
[01:53:34.190 --> 01:53:38.352]  For really, I say six months, it's more like a year, keeps pulling this other little trick.
[01:53:39.872 --> 01:53:43.754]  And so it's several things going on at once.
[01:53:44.254 --> 01:53:48.456]  But we were talking to a caller who's an IT guy, and Justin.
[01:53:49.437 --> 01:53:53.078]  And Justin, tell us more about this, but then comment on the filtering.
[01:53:53.138 --> 01:53:59.741]  I mean, that certainly we know is going on, but why don't you describe to the listeners the difference between these types of problems and filtering.
[01:54:00.430 --> 01:54:03.753]  Well, the problem you're looking at right now is just basic network connectivity.
[01:54:05.214 --> 01:54:07.295]  It's similar to just cutting the wire.
[01:54:07.335 --> 01:54:08.316]  There's nothing getting through.
[01:54:09.217 --> 01:54:10.238]  The filtering's different.
[01:54:10.998 --> 01:54:17.443]  Companies out there make these large lists, and they try and categorize websites, and it's really pretty much a joke.
[01:54:17.763 --> 01:54:27.591]  Sites get stuck in these categories inappropriately, and there's no way to get out of them, and there's no way to look at the list ahead of time to ask them to take you off before they publish it, because that's their only asset is those lists.
[01:54:31.461 --> 01:54:34.623]  How do you get around that when a library is blocking you?
[01:54:36.705 --> 01:54:37.445]  Legally, you don't.
[01:54:38.026 --> 01:54:39.947]  I'm sure there's other stuff you could do that they wouldn't like.
[01:54:41.088 --> 01:54:45.371]  I've had jobs before where they filtered everything that we could see there.
[01:54:45.892 --> 01:54:50.235]  You try and go to the Glock website and be stuck as mature content.
[01:54:50.255 --> 01:54:51.996]  Same category as pornography.
[01:54:53.698 --> 01:54:55.759]  Michigan Militia's website was labeled a hate speech site.
[01:54:57.259 --> 01:54:58.139]  Well, so are mine.
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:02.402]  But it's the same thing with, remember the gun company with Dell?
[01:55:02.442 --> 01:55:06.284]  They tried to buy a computer and Dell said, sorry, guns are evil.
[01:55:06.624 --> 01:55:07.624]  Oh yeah, I saw that one.
[01:55:08.485 --> 01:55:10.125]  Oh, there's some wacky stuff out there, that's for sure.
[01:55:10.826 --> 01:55:15.068]  Well, we think that somehow that's getting loaded into Time Warner.
[01:55:15.568 --> 01:55:18.069]  Separately, I understand the other problem you're talking about.
[01:55:18.089 --> 01:55:19.790]  It's just ongoing.
[01:55:20.851 --> 01:55:25.193]  But, you know, I think that you're right to say that, or I'm guessing you're saying that
[01:55:26.272 --> 01:55:29.875]  They don't really load that into their switching systems.
[01:55:29.915 --> 01:55:32.437]  That's loaded in individually into computers.
[01:55:33.698 --> 01:55:34.339]  Not quite.
[01:55:34.379 --> 01:55:41.685]  There's what's called a proxy server, which will intercept your web request, and it'll figure out whether or not you're allowed to go there or not and send you back a yes or no page.
[01:55:42.865 --> 01:55:45.307]  But there are softwares that are loaded right onto the computer, right?
[01:55:45.628 --> 01:55:48.190]  Well yeah, that's one way of doing it too, but that's the worst way.
[01:55:49.451 --> 01:55:52.073]  Some ISPs actually do it all the time and you don't even know it.
[01:55:53.264 --> 01:55:56.786]  Not loading it on your computer, but intercepting all your web requests.
[01:55:56.966 --> 01:56:08.370]  So there are... Well, you know, we talked in Time Warner censoring and we got mainstream news reports, credible blogs reporting on them, blocking Cindy Sheehan links and things.
[01:56:08.990 --> 01:56:11.011]  So, I mean, the people are saying they're doing this.
[01:56:11.211 --> 01:56:15.053]  I'll have to look into that.
[01:56:15.593 --> 01:56:17.254]  I was made aware of the issue just because it's...
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:20.982]  You know, Cogent and Level 3 fighting with each other.
[01:56:21.002 --> 01:56:21.662]  Well, do me a favor.
[01:56:21.682 --> 01:56:26.386]  Write up a little blurb, because it fits in with what I've been told by my web people, if you want.
[01:56:26.406 --> 01:56:33.932]  Write a little blurb up about what you think the problem really is, but also comment on those filters and how ISPs can also put filters in.
[01:56:34.313 --> 01:56:36.635]  Because we get constant complaints about this.
[01:56:38.876 --> 01:56:41.198]  And, you know, our sites are up and people just can't get to them.
[01:56:41.759 --> 01:56:41.899]  Yep.
[01:56:42.940 --> 01:56:44.881]  Well, I really appreciate your call, sir.
[01:56:45.162 --> 01:56:45.562]  Oh, you're welcome.
[01:56:46.262 --> 01:56:46.723]  Take care.
[01:56:47.805 --> 01:56:57.730]  Uh, yeah, you know, it's like George Dorey last night, uh, you know, he, uh, talked about it, because he was getting a lot of emails, uh, people saying they couldn't get on.
[01:56:58.950 --> 01:57:00.951]  And so he called me up, uh, and said, uh, what's going on?
[01:57:00.971 --> 01:57:07.614]  And I said, well, we know they're blocking us, and we know there's some type of internet outage going on, but it's, it's two things happening simultaneously.
[01:57:09.035 --> 01:57:15.318]  And we've confirmed that, and we've directly told John Warner how to fix it, and, uh, they're just like, no, we're not gonna fix it.
[01:57:18.058 --> 01:57:19.659]  And so it's very frustrating.
[01:57:20.179 --> 01:57:24.260]  We've got trace routes from all over the country showing exactly where it is.
[01:57:24.280 --> 01:57:27.462]  Alright, we'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:27.502 --> 01:57:29.743]  I'm going to cover news and then your calls.
[01:57:29.763 --> 01:57:32.584]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.584 --> 01:57:37.485]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[01:57:37.806 --> 01:57:38.606]  Or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.967 --> 01:57:50.607]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.288 --> 01:57:52.328]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.048 --> 01:57:54.229]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.829 --> 01:57:55.630]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.390 --> 01:57:57.430]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.951 --> 01:58:01.932]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.132 --> 01:58:06.254]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.275 --> 01:58:09.816]  Alright, now into our number three.
[01:58:09.896 --> 01:58:13.797]  We're talking about every issue you can imagine.
[01:58:13.837 --> 01:58:17.519]  Callers always take us in very informative directions.
[01:58:18.542 --> 01:58:23.686]  And, uh, I'm gonna take three or four more calls, and I am gonna get in the news, and we'll come back and take more calls.
[01:58:25.287 --> 01:58:28.969]  Right now, let's talk to Ian and Canada, then Alex, Tim, and others.
[01:58:29.009 --> 01:58:29.630]  Go ahead, Ian.
[01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:30.670]  Hey there, Alex.
[01:58:30.710 --> 01:58:31.391]  How are you doing?
[01:58:31.511 --> 01:58:31.891]  Good, sir.
[01:58:32.812 --> 01:58:40.497]  Uh, now, Stars, uh, I live some way north of Toronto, and I deliberately went to Toronto, licked a few door handles, and went to the Stars concert.
[01:58:40.557 --> 01:58:44.820]  And, uh, coincidentally, when I got there, Rush were playing, singing these words.
[01:58:45.481 --> 01:58:51.685]  And the men who hold high places must be the ones to start, to mold a new reality, closer to the heart.
[01:58:52.085 --> 01:58:57.589]  The blacksmith and the artist, reflected in their art, forge their creativity, closer to the heart.
[01:58:57.909 --> 01:59:04.713]  Philosophers and clown men, each must know his part, to sow a new mentality, closer to the heart.
[01:59:05.093 --> 01:59:11.237]  You can be the captain, I will draw the chart, sailing into destiny, closer to the heart.
[01:59:12.032 --> 01:59:18.816]  Then after that, ACDC came on and they played the New World Order Anthem, Hell's Bells and Highway to Hell.
[01:59:18.836 --> 01:59:20.076]  It cost us 20 bucks.
[01:59:20.737 --> 01:59:30.062]  We saw some excellent chemtrails, 500,000 people, complete crowd control there, and it was quite an amazing concert.
[01:59:31.482 --> 01:59:34.464]  And as far as the net goes, that's my business.
[01:59:35.404 --> 01:59:40.067]  Last Thursday I had 16 websites on 4 servers in 3 countries and all were down
[01:59:40.546 --> 01:59:41.927]  Or at least I couldn't get to them.
[01:59:42.908 --> 01:59:54.959]  Sometimes I'll go to your site and it takes me to the Simpatico Bell slash Microsoft Network because they're in bed with Microsoft now and it's the search page and I'll hit the URL again and I'm there.
[01:59:54.979 --> 02:00:00.524]  It's almost like they're saying well hey guys we're tracking you and we're letting you know that we're doing that.
[02:00:00.884 --> 02:00:04.888]  So for the outages I've been told that it's the Bell routing system.
[02:00:05.428 --> 02:00:06.970]  It's higher level network
[02:00:07.563 --> 02:00:08.544]  Restructuring.
[02:00:08.684 --> 02:00:09.544]  It's AOL.
[02:00:09.664 --> 02:00:11.145]  It's warring ISPs.
[02:00:11.765 --> 02:00:13.226]  And I don't buy any of this.
[02:00:15.047 --> 02:00:20.290]  And interestingly enough, most of the websites being blocked are truth-telling, anti-New World Order sites.
[02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:21.010]  I have one.
[02:00:22.551 --> 02:00:23.732]  I will not tell you the URL.
[02:00:23.792 --> 02:00:25.673]  I'll tell you you're a man when I get off.
[02:00:26.693 --> 02:00:28.194]  But yeah, I have one.
[02:00:28.274 --> 02:00:31.956]  And to tell you the truth, I hadn't updated it since last Christmas.
[02:00:32.737 --> 02:00:34.818]  When I put a warning of a draft up there.
[02:00:36.577 --> 02:00:37.898]  Uh, things started to happen.
[02:00:38.339 --> 02:00:39.500]  I've got other things to do.
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:42.462]  Well, speaking of the New World Order, Israel's saying, hey, the U.S.
[02:00:42.502 --> 02:00:48.027]  is about to slap sanctions on, um, Syria as part of our New World Order.
[02:00:48.047 --> 02:00:53.271]  I mean, they're just constantly saying, New World Order, one world government, and then we talk about it and we're bad.
[02:00:53.532 --> 02:01:00.838]  Would this be the, uh, Israel that, uh, if I'm opposed to their policies, Webster's Dictionary, uh, calls me an anti-Semite now?
[02:01:01.644 --> 02:01:11.107]  Yes, half the Israelis who are against the current policies are anti-Semites, and then when the other party gets in and the other half of the public are against those policies, I guess those Jews will be anti-Semites.
[02:01:11.147 --> 02:01:11.928]  It's ridiculous.
[02:01:12.268 --> 02:01:12.948]  Thanks for the call.
[02:01:13.768 --> 02:01:16.249]  I really appreciate your call, sir, and for that info.
[02:01:16.269 --> 02:01:16.830]  Very interesting.
[02:01:17.530 --> 02:01:19.310]  Let's talk to Alex in North Carolina.
[02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:20.031]  Alex, go ahead.
[02:01:20.411 --> 02:01:21.151]  Hi, Alex.
[02:01:21.391 --> 02:01:26.373]  I kind of agree with the second caller before that talking about the net
[02:01:26.815 --> 02:01:28.597]  Outages being caused by those two warring companies.
[02:01:28.617 --> 02:01:34.882]  Now, we understand the net outages, but sir, on top of that, while that's going on, somebody else did something else, I guess, as a cover.
[02:01:35.183 --> 02:01:35.983]  Oh, I wouldn't be surprised.
[02:01:36.083 --> 02:01:39.146]  And it also shows how easy it is for them to shut off the whole internet if they want to.
[02:01:39.166 --> 02:01:42.929]  It only takes three or four companies if they want to really shut it off.
[02:01:44.460 --> 02:01:48.664]  I found a really good quote that I think sums up the goals of the New World Order.
[02:01:48.704 --> 02:01:50.125]  If I could read it, it's from the book 1984.
[02:01:50.525 --> 02:01:51.766]  I'll try to be as quick as I can.
[02:01:52.067 --> 02:01:54.589]  You know, I'll tell you what, let me just hold you over to be fair.
[02:01:54.809 --> 02:01:54.969]  Okay.
[02:01:55.429 --> 02:01:58.953]  And then you're welcome to read that from 1984.
[02:01:59.553 --> 02:02:04.157]  We'll come back to Alex and we'll talk to Tim and then that's it for calls for about 20 minutes or so.
[02:02:04.177 --> 02:02:05.738]  I want to get into some of the news.
[02:02:05.758 --> 02:02:05.818]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:11.852 --> 02:02:12.132]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:12.172 --> 02:02:18.138]  And we're here live, folks, Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:02:18.719 --> 02:02:20.781]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:02:21.121 --> 02:02:22.963]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[02:02:23.543 --> 02:02:27.427]  Channel casting, of course, on the Internet at infowars.com and prisonplot.com.
[02:02:27.808 --> 02:02:30.670]  Or there's always the network site, GCN Live.
[02:02:31.171 --> 02:02:32.572]  GCNlive.com.
[02:02:33.673 --> 02:02:35.275]  And on global, shortwave.
[02:02:35.996 --> 02:02:38.401]  We got new global shortwave frequencies at night.
[02:02:38.742 --> 02:02:40.725]  We'll tell you about those briefly when we get back.
[02:02:41.066 --> 02:02:41.507]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.713 --> 02:02:49.574]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.814 --> 02:02:51.395]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.735 --> 02:02:56.437]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.757 --> 02:03:01.179]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.599 --> 02:03:05.781]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.001 --> 02:03:08.862]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.942 --> 02:03:13.603]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.803 --> 02:03:18.224]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.444 --> 02:03:25.666]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:06:04.475 --> 02:06:06.096]  All right, we're going to take a few calls.
[02:06:06.997 --> 02:06:09.638]  Just let Alex and Tim finish up, then I'm going to go into news.
[02:06:09.658 --> 02:06:11.539]  We'll go back to your calls.
[02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:18.344]  Let me just say this now before the next 51 minutes elapses and this broadcast is over.
[02:06:18.464 --> 02:06:19.825]  I tend to do this more and more.
[02:06:20.525 --> 02:06:24.708]  I'm never really promoting my documentary films, never really promoting events we're having.
[02:06:26.509 --> 02:06:31.612]  It's clear because of other internet sabotage and things that we've been dealing with that aren't
[02:06:32.512 --> 02:06:34.534]  You know, just internet outages.
[02:06:34.594 --> 02:06:38.276]  I mean, people trying to hack in and post porn on the websites.
[02:06:38.396 --> 02:06:42.079]  You know, giant denial of service attacks.
[02:06:42.099 --> 02:06:45.321]  I mean, clear activities.
[02:06:46.822 --> 02:06:53.207]  But we've got to add even more redundancy and more servers and more co-location.
[02:06:55.809 --> 02:06:57.730]  And again, I sound like an idiot with all these terms.
[02:06:57.870 --> 02:06:58.771]  It's like I'm a
[02:06:59.449 --> 02:07:02.970]  Guy who's had three hours of auto mechanic school trying to tell you how to fix a car.
[02:07:03.370 --> 02:07:05.691]  I don't know all the details, but I know we've got to add more.
[02:07:05.711 --> 02:07:08.052]  I mean, we're really having a big affair.
[02:07:08.072 --> 02:07:08.812]  And that's expensive.
[02:07:10.333 --> 02:07:11.033]  Very expensive.
[02:07:11.093 --> 02:07:15.935]  I mean, we deal with a lot of expenses here, and I don't want to get up on air and whine about it, but we need your support.
[02:07:16.555 --> 02:07:18.316]  Number one, my videos are excellent.
[02:07:18.516 --> 02:07:19.596]  They're very informative.
[02:07:19.616 --> 02:07:20.316]  They wake people up.
[02:07:20.356 --> 02:07:21.617]  That's the number one reason to get them.
[02:07:23.137 --> 02:07:24.178]  But secondarily,
[02:07:26.264 --> 02:07:30.989]  It's expensive having tens of millions of visitors a month who buy nothing.
[02:07:33.131 --> 02:07:34.752]  But that's fine.
[02:07:35.433 --> 02:07:36.954]  The point is somebody's got to.
[02:07:37.835 --> 02:07:45.422]  And you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv and we're in the process of adding more server on that.
[02:07:45.482 --> 02:07:51.148]  I mean we got a whole bunch of smoking servers and supposed unlimited bandwidth and all ready for a few hours a night during
[02:07:51.973 --> 02:07:55.214]  During peak user time, it might get a little bit slow there.
[02:07:55.674 --> 02:07:58.055]  So we're fixing each problem as it comes.
[02:07:58.095 --> 02:08:01.315]  Gotta add really expensive solutions to that.
[02:08:01.455 --> 02:08:04.576]  So thank you for those who support PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:08:05.236 --> 02:08:06.117]  You make it possible.
[02:08:08.237 --> 02:08:10.098]  And we're going to be adding even more to that.
[02:08:10.898 --> 02:08:13.558]  Because victims of our own success.
[02:08:16.405 --> 02:08:18.726]  And plus we have so much free video on all the sites.
[02:08:18.746 --> 02:08:21.527]  We're trying to put all those even on another separate server.
[02:08:22.028 --> 02:08:23.949]  And we have such media-intensive websites.
[02:08:23.969 --> 02:08:27.830]  We're redesigning the websites, trying to make them easier to navigate and better.
[02:08:27.970 --> 02:08:29.331]  I mean, we're upgrading.
[02:08:29.371 --> 02:08:32.993]  We're going to do an even better job for you in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:08:33.053 --> 02:08:37.015]  So help us and stick with us.
[02:08:37.075 --> 02:08:39.276]  And we appreciate you being members of the team.
[02:08:39.496 --> 02:08:40.096]  All of you are.
[02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:59.843]  When you tell somebody about the radio show on your local AM or FM station, when you email your mom or your cousin or your neighbor or email list and tell them about the radio show, when you post on a blog, when you come to an event, when you get my documentaries and make copies, you're fighting the New World Order right on the front lines, folks.
[02:08:59.883 --> 02:09:01.984]  Because I know this, I'm not bragging, it's just fact.
[02:09:02.704 --> 02:09:03.764]  It's kind of scary, too.
[02:09:04.124 --> 02:09:05.984]  We are right on the tip of the spear.
[02:09:06.024 --> 02:09:07.665]  We are right on the cutting edge.
[02:09:07.725 --> 02:09:10.005]  We are right on the vanguard.
[02:09:11.241 --> 02:09:12.701]  Of the fight against the New World Order.
[02:09:15.662 --> 02:09:19.364]  And we need people not to get behind us, but to get right up here beside us.
[02:09:21.724 --> 02:09:26.106]  And, uh, so I hope you'll go get memberships at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:09:29.207 --> 02:09:36.509]  And I hope, uh, you know, they're 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, and you get three free months if you sign up for a year, and that makes it possible.
[02:09:37.069 --> 02:09:40.050]  I mean, when you got, now, seven employees, and they have to add another,
[02:09:41.195 --> 02:09:42.916]  And, uh, I mean, you know the drill.
[02:09:43.036 --> 02:09:43.636]  I'm not whining.
[02:09:43.656 --> 02:10:00.923]  I'm just telling you as a status report where this node or where this Firebase, you know, in this fight, you know, where we are with basically ship scores, you know, the amount of enemies we've engaged, what we've destroyed, what we've built, uh, you know, the people we've rescued.
[02:10:00.963 --> 02:10:03.744]  I mean, literally, that's how I see it is, you know, we're out there just
[02:10:04.582 --> 02:10:16.133]  Basically, rampaging around, attacking the enemy's propaganda lines, engaging them, waking up their own people, deprogramming their own minions, and we're very effective at it.
[02:10:16.153 --> 02:10:24.801]  You know, the team I've got, the minds we've got, the great writers we've got, the researchers we've got, we work really, really hard, and we're going to work even harder for you.
[02:10:25.362 --> 02:10:27.824]  But we can do even more if we have that support.
[02:10:29.531 --> 02:10:30.392]  We need that support.
[02:10:30.732 --> 02:10:32.733]  We either have to get smaller or get bigger.
[02:10:32.773 --> 02:10:35.996]  There is no, you know, staying where we're at in this fight.
[02:10:36.096 --> 02:10:37.537]  Obviously, we want to move forward.
[02:10:37.977 --> 02:10:38.818]  We're very lean.
[02:10:38.838 --> 02:10:39.678]  We're very mean.
[02:10:40.479 --> 02:10:46.403]  I mean, you know, a newspaper website as big as one of my websites would have about 200 employees.
[02:10:48.084 --> 02:10:48.684]  Conservatively.
[02:10:50.706 --> 02:10:56.850]  I mean, Infowars.com, one of my sites, which I want to make a lot better, it freaks me out that millions of people visit.
[02:10:56.970 --> 02:10:57.991]  It freaks me out that
[02:10:58.703 --> 02:10:59.804]  You know, there's dead links on it.
[02:10:59.824 --> 02:11:01.984]  It freaks me out that, you know, there's typos.
[02:11:02.004 --> 02:11:04.686]  But I guess people actually like that because they know it's real.
[02:11:05.186 --> 02:11:06.947]  But the point is, we want to make it even better for you.
[02:11:06.967 --> 02:11:08.707]  We want more video, more audio.
[02:11:09.048 --> 02:11:12.429]  We want just to make it great, so we can wake people up.
[02:11:13.509 --> 02:11:19.832]  And, you know, there's like, there's one and a half people, maybe two, running InfoWars.com.
[02:11:21.233 --> 02:11:22.814]  And I have to sit there and give all the orders.
[02:11:24.074 --> 02:11:24.714]  It's exhausting.
[02:11:24.754 --> 02:11:25.695]  It's also exhilarating.
[02:11:26.155 --> 02:11:28.296]  Same thing over at the Prison Planet websites.
[02:11:29.628 --> 02:11:32.152]  We got two guys running three sites over there.
[02:11:34.176 --> 02:11:37.942]  So, again, just support us and we can do more.
[02:11:38.683 --> 02:11:44.172]  Because you know we'll literally kill ourselves in this fight, you know, working ourselves to death.
[02:11:45.940 --> 02:11:51.965]  I mean, I've been doing it again lately, these 18-hour days, and it's because stuff is moving so fast.
[02:11:52.065 --> 02:11:54.868]  It is really coming down on us right now.
[02:11:54.908 --> 02:12:05.397]  And so I want to thank all the listeners, all the Eminem affiliates, Courtway, WWCR, Dwayne Coots, our IT guy, Brian Slickheisen, Paul Watson, Steve Watson, Violet Jones.
[02:12:06.377 --> 02:12:09.660]  I want to thank some of our other employees who don't wish to be named.
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:11.241]  I don't blame them.
[02:12:14.381 --> 02:12:15.982]  All of you have done yeoman's work.
[02:12:16.062 --> 02:12:17.042]  You've got to stay focused.
[02:12:17.603 --> 02:12:18.663]  You've got to stay frosty.
[02:12:19.123 --> 02:12:21.024]  We are reaping mighty harvest.
[02:12:21.064 --> 02:12:22.045]  Look, we've been planting.
[02:12:22.425 --> 02:12:23.285]  We've been watering.
[02:12:24.025 --> 02:12:25.246]  The sun's been shining.
[02:12:26.046 --> 02:12:29.288]  And, I mean, it's like we're trying to bring in a harvest here and people are waking up.
[02:12:29.628 --> 02:12:30.728]  And it's even getting bigger.
[02:12:31.009 --> 02:12:33.910]  You know, the lost opportunities to wake people up that we have
[02:12:34.871 --> 02:12:35.972]  Are really sad right now.
[02:12:36.032 --> 02:12:37.053]  We could do even more.
[02:12:37.133 --> 02:12:38.454]  We are at the jump point.
[02:12:38.995 --> 02:12:39.816]  All of us together.
[02:12:40.356 --> 02:12:41.837]  I can only talk about our operation.
[02:12:42.158 --> 02:12:46.561]  We're a very small part of a bigger attack on the New World Order and a defense of humanity.
[02:12:47.802 --> 02:12:49.604]  This is the fight of free humanity.
[02:12:50.345 --> 02:12:51.365]  We will get on the air.
[02:12:51.405 --> 02:12:54.888]  We will talk about how they're killing us with vaccines and how they're openly sterilizing us.
[02:12:54.908 --> 02:12:55.949]  Because we got the documents.
[02:12:56.230 --> 02:12:58.692]  We will talk about how the government carries out 9-11 attacks.
[02:12:58.932 --> 02:12:59.933]  We have their own documents.
[02:13:00.698 --> 02:13:01.959]  We will talk about it.
[02:13:02.020 --> 02:13:04.302]  We will tell you the sodium fluoride is poisonous.
[02:13:04.682 --> 02:13:06.484]  We will tell you aspartame is bad.
[02:13:06.804 --> 02:13:09.567]  We will tell you genetically modified foods are very dangerous.
[02:13:09.767 --> 02:13:16.453]  And we'll have the top scientists, the fathers of entire genetic procedures on to give you the information.
[02:13:16.854 --> 02:13:18.495]  We will defend the Second Amendment.
[02:13:18.535 --> 02:13:19.797]  We will defend the borders.
[02:13:20.157 --> 02:13:22.019]  We will do all those things.
[02:13:23.300 --> 02:13:24.141]  But it takes your support.
[02:13:25.501 --> 02:13:28.584]  And I want you to call every AM and FM affiliate we've got, because we're getting more affiliates.
[02:13:28.604 --> 02:13:29.525]  And I want you to thank them.
[02:13:29.565 --> 02:13:32.447]  And if you've got a local business, I want you to sponsor them.
[02:13:33.008 --> 02:13:39.113]  Or I want you to support their sponsors and tell them you're supporting their sponsors because of what they're supporting.
[02:13:40.014 --> 02:13:41.776]  You know, we don't have David Rockefeller funding us.
[02:13:42.576 --> 02:13:46.580]  They've got a $6 billion Ford Foundation tearing down the borders.
[02:13:47.293 --> 02:13:54.138]  We've got the $20 billion Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, just one arm of it, ripping down the borders and the sovereignty.
[02:13:54.658 --> 02:13:59.702]  And we're just sitting here, literally, just battling them toe-to-toe.
[02:14:01.924 --> 02:14:09.489]  But our ranks are just swelling right now, because the enemy's moving, and for every action, there is an equal or greater reaction.
[02:14:09.509 --> 02:14:13.552]  That is scientific law of dynamics of nature.
[02:14:13.933 --> 02:14:15.694]  That is THE dynamics of the universe.
[02:14:16.423 --> 02:14:19.205]  The demonstrable, provable dynamic of it.
[02:14:19.465 --> 02:14:21.226]  And the Bible has an even better way of saying it.
[02:14:21.606 --> 02:14:26.589]  When the enemy comes in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[02:14:27.229 --> 02:14:29.190]  I forget which verse it is, but I love that verse.
[02:14:29.991 --> 02:14:30.591]  And it's true!
[02:14:31.912 --> 02:14:33.373]  I mean, they're rising right now.
[02:14:33.453 --> 02:14:34.673]  We're rising as well.
[02:14:35.394 --> 02:14:36.454]  That's how this works.
[02:14:36.935 --> 02:14:39.496]  But our rising has to be greater than their rising.
[02:14:40.797 --> 02:14:47.222]  And everything you do, every person you talk to in the grocery store line, every email you send, everything you do, you are savaging them!
[02:14:47.462 --> 02:14:49.804]  Imagine you've got a sledgehammer just wrecking their equipment!
[02:14:50.044 --> 02:14:50.605]  Naaah!
[02:14:50.665 --> 02:14:53.027]  Slashing and bashing and kicking it in!
[02:14:53.047 --> 02:14:54.488]  And you're jumping on top tanks!
[02:14:54.868 --> 02:14:56.950]  You know, image each lie as a tank.
[02:14:56.990 --> 02:14:58.531]  You jump up and throw a hanger nade in.
[02:14:58.571 --> 02:14:59.011]  Bleugh!
[02:14:59.031 --> 02:14:59.451]  Take that!
[02:14:59.732 --> 02:15:00.272]  Boom!
[02:15:00.352 --> 02:15:01.253]  I mean, just get them!
[02:15:01.293 --> 02:15:01.993]  Naaah!
[02:15:02.494 --> 02:15:03.034]  Naaah!
[02:15:03.074 --> 02:15:03.675]  Just come on!
[02:15:03.695 --> 02:15:04.575]  Let's get them!
[02:15:05.216 --> 02:15:06.837]  They want to kill us and our families!
[02:15:06.857 --> 02:15:08.238]  They want to kill our children!
[02:15:08.358 --> 02:15:09.499]  Defend your young!
[02:15:09.519 --> 02:15:10.220]  Defend!
[02:15:11.027 --> 02:15:12.127]  Never back down!
[02:15:12.247 --> 02:15:13.247]  Never back down!
[02:15:13.527 --> 02:15:14.248]  Take them on!
[02:15:14.308 --> 02:15:14.968]  Head on!
[02:15:16.008 --> 02:15:17.508]  You're a bunch of murderin' trash!
[02:15:17.748 --> 02:15:18.608]  We're takin' you on!
[02:15:18.648 --> 02:15:19.329]  Head on!
[02:15:19.609 --> 02:15:20.289]  Head on!
[02:15:20.449 --> 02:15:21.549]  There's nothin' you can do!
[02:15:21.669 --> 02:15:22.769]  We're comin' for ya!
[02:15:23.469 --> 02:15:24.270]  You know it!
[02:15:25.590 --> 02:15:27.050]  We got God on our side!
[02:15:27.090 --> 02:15:28.150]  We're comin' for ya!
[02:15:28.190 --> 02:15:28.910]  Get ready!
[02:15:30.291 --> 02:15:31.511]  You're goin' down!
[02:15:32.351 --> 02:15:34.171]  You've gotten away with it far too long!
[02:15:34.211 --> 02:15:35.252]  You're goin' down!
[02:15:35.492 --> 02:15:37.072]  Everybody's gonna see what you are!
[02:15:39.262 --> 02:15:43.946]  The most pathetic thing is all these yuppies and all these do-gooders and people that think the system gave them everything they got.
[02:15:44.807 --> 02:15:47.609]  It was the liberty we had that you've been feeding on.
[02:15:48.270 --> 02:15:49.551]  And they're so aligned with it.
[02:15:49.571 --> 02:15:53.434]  They believe all the sweet talk and all the bull.
[02:15:55.556 --> 02:15:56.616]  It isn't going to work soon.
[02:15:56.636 --> 02:16:00.320]  The New World Order's time is very, very short and they know it.
[02:16:03.042 --> 02:16:04.723]  And you know who the vengeance belongs to.
[02:16:04.783 --> 02:16:06.885]  But we're God's tool and we're going to smash them.
[02:16:07.631 --> 02:16:08.311]  And they know it.
[02:16:08.731 --> 02:16:10.151]  They're afraid of us right now.
[02:16:10.692 --> 02:16:11.332]  They're afraid.
[02:16:11.392 --> 02:16:12.772]  We've got the initiative!
[02:16:13.612 --> 02:16:15.752]  No matter what happens in the future, it may look bad.
[02:16:15.792 --> 02:16:17.453]  You may think we're losing, but we're winning.
[02:16:18.153 --> 02:16:19.533]  Don't ever believe their bull.
[02:16:19.813 --> 02:16:21.393]  Don't ever believe their propaganda.
[02:16:21.894 --> 02:16:25.734]  They'll love to wreck this country and bring it all the way down just so they can have total control.
[02:16:25.994 --> 02:16:27.875]  And then rebuild it in their own disgusting image.
[02:16:28.115 --> 02:16:29.095]  The image of their father.
[02:16:30.595 --> 02:16:31.315]  Let's talk.
[02:16:31.415 --> 02:16:32.795]  Alex, do your 1984 clip.
[02:16:32.815 --> 02:16:33.876]  I'm sorry, I forgot you were there.
[02:16:35.196 --> 02:16:35.776]  This quote is
[02:16:37.924 --> 02:16:39.085]  He was just there, now he's gone.
[02:16:39.105 --> 02:16:41.948]  Can you hear me?
[02:16:41.968 --> 02:16:42.628]  Can you hear me now?
[02:16:42.648 --> 02:16:43.729]  Uh, yeah, we faded you down.
[02:16:43.789 --> 02:16:44.209]  You know what?
[02:16:44.330 --> 02:16:44.490]  Okay.
[02:16:45.350 --> 02:16:46.832]  For some reason it's hard to get this done.
[02:16:46.852 --> 02:16:49.654]  Just stay there, we're gonna break, I promise we'll come right back to you when we get back.
[02:16:50.195 --> 02:16:53.778]  But you had just enough time to do the quote and then you got faded down or something.
[02:16:54.518 --> 02:16:56.200]  Well, or you weren't taught, your phone cut out.
[02:16:56.880 --> 02:17:00.884]  We'll come right back to you, Alex, in South Carolina, or North Carolina, then we'll go to Tim.
[02:17:01.645 --> 02:17:05.508]  You know what, that'll be it for calls, actually, because I've got to cover 30 minutes of news, at least, that I haven't gotten to.
[02:17:07.196 --> 02:17:09.717]  I just did that rant because, I mean, I see the threat.
[02:17:09.737 --> 02:17:10.477]  I see what it is.
[02:17:10.537 --> 02:17:11.697]  I mean, it's just horrible.
[02:17:12.938 --> 02:17:15.978]  It's horrible, but we gotta get an attitude of, we're in the right.
[02:17:16.458 --> 02:17:17.339]  We're fighting evil.
[02:17:17.759 --> 02:17:18.619]  They're out of control.
[02:17:18.659 --> 02:17:19.539]  We got the evidence.
[02:17:19.959 --> 02:17:21.800]  Time to start being namby-pamby about it.
[02:17:21.840 --> 02:17:22.340]  That's over.
[02:17:22.600 --> 02:17:23.480]  Those days are over.
[02:17:24.981 --> 02:17:26.701]  This is mortal combat.
[02:17:26.761 --> 02:17:28.142]  This is for everything.
[02:17:28.882 --> 02:17:33.663]  And so much of war is your mind facing the truth, seeing the enemy's camouflage.
[02:17:34.395 --> 02:17:36.437]  So many of you are in love with their illusions.
[02:17:36.878 --> 02:17:38.480]  You're in love with their camouflage.
[02:17:39.961 --> 02:17:41.183]  And you're gonna be destroyed.
[02:17:41.603 --> 02:17:42.264]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:48.030 --> 02:17:50.233]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[02:17:50.273 --> 02:17:52.015]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:18:01.047]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[02:18:01.287 --> 02:18:03.929]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'

[02:19:45.508 --> 02:19:49.432]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:19:49.632 --> 02:20:01.922]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:20:02.342 --> 02:20:02.743]  The U.S.
[02:20:02.783 --> 02:20:08.367]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:20:08.768 --> 02:20:10.990]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:20:12.831 --> 02:20:13.892]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:20:13.932 --> 02:20:16.775]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:20:16.895 --> 02:20:22.920]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.

[02:20:46.503 --> 02:20:48.104]  Government is death which governs me.
[02:20:48.644 --> 02:20:49.964]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:20:50.404 --> 02:20:53.105]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:20:53.545 --> 02:20:56.206]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:20:56.646 --> 02:21:03.108]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:21:26.495 --> 02:21:27.995]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[02:21:30.396 --> 02:21:32.256]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:21:36.653 --> 02:21:37.694]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[02:21:38.254 --> 02:21:39.455]  Osama Bin Forgotten.
[02:21:39.895 --> 02:21:43.557]  Go to LibertyStickers.com and express your freedom of speech today.
[02:21:43.577 --> 02:21:46.960]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:21:59.165 --> 02:22:04.369]  We're here Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:06.570]  Make no mistake, they've declared war on you.
[02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:10.453]  I mean, they say they're going to enslave you and kill most of us.
[02:22:11.453 --> 02:22:12.774]  And I'm not putting up with it.
[02:22:12.794 --> 02:22:13.315]  It's that simple.
[02:22:13.415 --> 02:22:16.337]  Alex, now, please, your phone was garbled.
[02:22:16.377 --> 02:22:17.898]  Try to give us the 1984 clip.
[02:22:18.098 --> 02:22:18.318]  Okay.
[02:22:19.119 --> 02:22:23.762]  Now, in this quote, Winston is in the Ministry of Wealth, and he's being tortured by O'Brien.
[02:22:24.440 --> 02:22:27.362]  And O'Brien is telling him about... He's being loved!
[02:22:27.462 --> 02:22:28.663]  He's being loved by O'Brien.
[02:22:28.703 --> 02:22:30.445]  He's learning to love Big Brother.
[02:22:31.085 --> 02:22:33.587]  And O'Brien is talking to him about the nature of power.
[02:22:35.088 --> 02:22:37.570]  Power is an inflicting pain and humiliation.
[02:22:37.730 --> 02:22:43.815]  Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing.
[02:22:44.335 --> 02:22:47.077]  You begin to see then what kind of world we are creating?
[02:22:47.497 --> 02:22:52.261]  It's the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic utopias the old reformers imagined.
[02:22:54.728 --> 02:22:56.870]  A world of fear and treachery and torment.
[02:22:57.250 --> 02:22:59.511]  A world of trampling and being trampled upon.
[02:22:59.571 --> 02:23:04.054]  A world which will grow not less but more merciless as it refines itself.
[02:23:04.654 --> 02:23:07.136]  Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain.
[02:23:07.156 --> 02:23:10.378]  The old civilizations claim that they were founded on love or justice.
[02:23:10.998 --> 02:23:12.519]  Ours is founded on hatred.
[02:23:12.539 --> 02:23:18.183]  In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement.
[02:23:18.863 --> 02:23:20.645]  Everything else we shall destroy.
[02:23:20.825 --> 02:23:21.205]  Everything.
[02:23:22.639 --> 02:23:22.919]  Thank you.
[02:23:23.580 --> 02:23:24.520]  And then it goes on.
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:28.022]  Always pressing on the nerve of power, Winston.
[02:23:28.422 --> 02:23:32.745]  Always grinding in the nerve with a priest of power, Winston.
[02:23:33.245 --> 02:23:35.266]  No, you'll be defeated, Sublin.
[02:23:35.667 --> 02:23:36.627]  We'll defeat you.
[02:23:37.428 --> 02:23:39.189]  You're the last man, Winston.
[02:23:39.229 --> 02:23:41.030]  Let you be that last man.
[02:23:41.050 --> 02:23:51.456]  And then he stood there, looking at his scrofulous skin, his teeth falling out, emaciated, O'Brien smiled and pulled out one of his incisors.
[02:23:52.185 --> 02:23:53.686]  Yeah, it's pretty powerful, isn't it?
[02:23:53.826 --> 02:23:55.528]  It's the kind of world that they're trying to build.
[02:23:55.968 --> 02:23:57.249]  And I'm not going along with it.
[02:23:57.269 --> 02:23:58.070]  They really are!
[02:23:58.230 --> 02:24:03.454]  See, the average person goes, we're trying to defeat them in Iraq, bring freedom, kill all the Arabs.
[02:24:03.575 --> 02:24:05.136]  I hear them giggle on talk radio.
[02:24:05.536 --> 02:24:07.418]  Let's just admit it, we need to kill them all.
[02:24:07.638 --> 02:24:11.581]  But what they don't understand is it's designed to lose.
[02:24:11.641 --> 02:24:14.063]  They make more money if we're there forever.
[02:24:14.083 --> 02:24:17.326]  And you cannot get that through these good old boys' heads.
[02:24:17.346 --> 02:24:18.387]  They're dumb as dirt.
[02:24:19.178 --> 02:24:22.581]  Well, they can't imagine a boot stomping on a human face forever.
[02:24:23.582 --> 02:24:29.307]  Well, they'll have the jackboots on, and when they get drugged away, look, it's just like in 1984.
[02:24:30.408 --> 02:24:33.831]  And by the way, Eric Blair, known as George Orwell, actually did this and lived this.
[02:24:33.891 --> 02:24:34.912]  Some people understand.
[02:24:34.932 --> 02:24:37.394]  That's why the book's so scary.
[02:24:37.935 --> 02:24:39.776]  But for those who don't know, you should go research it.
[02:24:41.318 --> 02:24:42.619]  You have to realize, though, that
[02:24:43.800 --> 02:24:50.122]  That in the film, you know, the kids tattle on the parents, the CPS takes the kids, you know, all the same stuff happening that's now happening.
[02:24:51.122 --> 02:24:53.503]  The government controls the pornography and gambling.
[02:24:53.583 --> 02:24:54.903]  Everywhere has lottery tickets.
[02:24:54.923 --> 02:24:56.243]  I mean, it's everything.
[02:24:56.603 --> 02:25:02.645]  They use petty-mindedness, idiocy, speeding up the pace of life, you know, all of this.
[02:25:02.725 --> 02:25:10.807]  But when they catch his neighbor, who's one of their biggest minions, and tell him he's bad, he goes, yes, yes, and he's their biggest servant.
[02:25:11.747 --> 02:25:18.673]  So see a lot of these people, they'll be in the black uniforms, but then when they get grabbed by the system, they'll think, okay, well I guess it's good.
[02:25:19.153 --> 02:25:20.895]  That's how brainwashed they are.
[02:25:21.215 --> 02:25:30.443]  Because they think in double think, or quack speak, they think that through the 11th edition ink sock, they think that
[02:25:31.303 --> 02:25:33.004]  They have power through the system.
[02:25:33.284 --> 02:25:49.254]  So their ego's tied up in it, and because they're afraid of the system, they engage in double-think to instantly hold two separate ideas at the same time, and forget they hold those two separate, but be able to bring in both views at the same time, and not have both views at the same time.
[02:25:49.614 --> 02:25:51.715]  It is self-hypnosis.
[02:25:52.316 --> 02:25:55.117]  And this is what neocons have to do to say Bush is conservative.
[02:25:57.579 --> 02:25:59.300]  Is that a bunch of crazy babble, or do you get what I'm saying?
[02:25:59.941 --> 02:26:01.062]  Or does it make sense, Alex?
[02:26:01.482 --> 02:26:03.804]  It makes... Unfortunately, it makes sense.
[02:26:05.486 --> 02:26:06.006]  I wish it didn't.
[02:26:07.107 --> 02:26:08.628]  Well, I appreciate you, Colin.
[02:26:08.648 --> 02:26:09.649]  And you want to read any more of that?
[02:26:09.669 --> 02:26:10.550]  What comes after that?
[02:26:10.570 --> 02:26:16.815]  Um... I ought to play some 1984 on air sometime.
[02:26:18.316 --> 02:26:26.083]  Well, it says, no one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer, but in the future there will be no wives and no friends.
[02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:30.075]  Children will be taken from their mothers at birth as one takes eggs from a hen.
[02:26:30.495 --> 02:26:32.217]  The sex instinct will be eradicated.
[02:26:32.258 --> 02:26:35.562]  Procreation will be an annual formality like the reward of a ration card.
[02:26:36.764 --> 02:26:37.985]  And it goes on.
[02:26:38.626 --> 02:26:44.354]  But in the end, he learns to... And I have Department of Education internal psychology documents.
[02:26:45.695 --> 02:26:49.316]  Charlotte Isbry has them in her book where they say it will be just like that.
[02:26:49.576 --> 02:26:50.476]  And they're already doing it.
[02:26:50.917 --> 02:26:56.738]  See, they get us corrupt and on the liquor and the football and look, people look dumber and stupider and more moronic.
[02:26:57.098 --> 02:26:58.679]  All the families are starting to break down.
[02:26:58.699 --> 02:27:03.280]  You know, you've got eighty-something percent illegitimacy in the black families.
[02:27:03.340 --> 02:27:05.161]  It's already now exploding in whites.
[02:27:05.201 --> 02:27:06.801]  It'll be that level soon.
[02:27:07.081 --> 02:27:09.802]  It'll be everybody and literally they'll just live in dormitories.
[02:27:10.042 --> 02:27:12.163]  That's the official plan with our children begging at birth.
[02:27:12.723 --> 02:27:13.883]  Hocked up on Prozac.
[02:27:13.943 --> 02:27:17.704]  It's kind of a Brave New World 1984 combo pack.
[02:27:18.405 --> 02:27:19.225]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:20.345 --> 02:27:21.565]  I'm glad you read that for people.
[02:27:21.585 --> 02:27:21.885]  Yeah.
[02:27:22.906 --> 02:27:23.946]  It's loving!
[02:27:24.006 --> 02:27:25.827]  Parents are bad!
[02:27:26.627 --> 02:27:32.508]  The Calhoun Reader for social workers at UT says the family is a disease.
[02:27:33.268 --> 02:27:34.649]  And we're not supposed to be upset about that.
[02:27:35.869 --> 02:27:36.789]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.250 --> 02:27:38.750]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.765 --> 02:27:42.527]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.171 --> 02:27:52.496]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:27:52.816 --> 02:27:58.101]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:27:58.521 --> 02:28:01.483]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:29:18.174 --> 02:29:21.675]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[02:29:46.079 --> 02:29:48.541]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[02:29:48.921 --> 02:29:53.924]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[02:29:54.084 --> 02:29:55.445]  But now, we don't have to.
[02:29:55.465 --> 02:30:03.911]  This sacro wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[02:30:04.251 --> 02:30:08.253]  Simply lie on your back with the sacro wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[02:30:08.514 --> 02:30:11.295]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[02:30:11.696 --> 02:30:15.198]  Use the sacro wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.

[02:30:46.038 --> 02:30:51.642]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:53.723 --> 02:30:57.466]  You know, I went into a big diatribe earlier about supporting this, but didn't tell you how.
[02:30:58.326 --> 02:31:07.072]  Call toll-free to get my documentary film, folks, Martial Law, Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[02:31:08.353 --> 02:31:09.594]  The toll-free number is 1-888-253-3139.
[02:31:15.638 --> 02:31:19.339]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:31:19.359 --> 02:31:30.103]  Or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:31:31.063 --> 02:31:43.588]  Or go to PrisonPlanet.tv and get a 15 cent a day monthly or yearly subscription to see my weekly TV reports, masses of special video reports that aren't on TV or in the films,
[02:31:44.258 --> 02:31:45.558]  I just added a new one of those.
[02:31:46.799 --> 02:31:49.119]  My book, Paul Watson's book, dozens of other films.
[02:31:49.179 --> 02:31:50.079]  It's an insane deal.
[02:31:50.719 --> 02:31:52.140]  I mean, normally one e-book is $5.95.
[02:31:52.180 --> 02:31:54.660]  You get a whole bunch of e-books and everything.
[02:31:54.880 --> 02:31:55.940]  It's worth it for that alone.
[02:31:56.601 --> 02:31:58.021]  PrisonPlanet.tv!
[02:31:59.401 --> 02:32:01.262]  Because we're about to upgrade the servers.
[02:32:01.282 --> 02:32:13.244]  We're going to have to have, I guess, load balance multi-server systems and backup servers in different countries and everything else redundant systems in this fight.
[02:32:13.928 --> 02:32:28.794]  That's going to take Capital, which again, I could care less about Capital, it's like grubby green toilet paper, but it's fuel, it's Fiat fuel that funds our cruisers, our bombers, our fighter bombers.
[02:32:28.894 --> 02:32:35.297]  That's what I see it all as in the Info War, as we just smash and rend and decimate enemy formations.
[02:32:36.118 --> 02:32:39.439]  And so we've got to launch an even more powerful flotilla
[02:32:40.413 --> 02:32:46.215]  We are trying to reconfigure and to deal with the activities we've been witnessing.
[02:32:47.396 --> 02:32:48.436]  It's always good to do that.
[02:32:48.456 --> 02:32:53.798]  Whenever there's problems or you get attacked, you just increase your versatility and your armaments.
[02:32:54.739 --> 02:32:55.459]  That's our rule.
[02:32:55.499 --> 02:32:58.940]  We increase what we're doing.
[02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:02.602]  So, InfoWars.com to order the videos via the SafeStrong Shopping Cart.

[02:33:24.813 --> 02:33:25.653]  Really nice place.
[02:33:26.033 --> 02:33:27.034]  The Original Alamo.
[02:33:27.054 --> 02:33:28.494]  Now it's going to be a national chain.
[02:33:29.414 --> 02:33:30.515]  Famous little Alamo there.
[02:33:31.195 --> 02:33:32.655]  Seats about 240 people.
[02:33:32.735 --> 02:33:34.916]  And it's getting pretty close to selling out.
[02:33:35.376 --> 02:33:37.656]  The Sunday night one has with almost no promotion.
[02:33:38.097 --> 02:33:41.337]  So go to the OriginalAlamo.com.
[02:33:42.258 --> 02:33:43.498]  OriginalAlamo.com.
[02:33:43.558 --> 02:33:45.298]  Link through to the calendar of events.
[02:33:45.739 --> 02:33:47.799]  And buy your tickets via their secure server.

[02:33:52.112 --> 02:33:56.696]  And an event that we really haven't promoted that is starting to sell quite nicely.
[02:33:56.716 --> 02:33:58.938]  It'll probably be sold out by the day of the event.
[02:33:59.358 --> 02:34:00.499]  Next Monday!
[02:34:00.899 --> 02:34:02.080]  Next Monday!
[02:34:02.621 --> 02:34:08.966]  Next Monday, South Lamar, the big, new, beautiful, biggest Alamo in Texas,
[02:34:09.754 --> 02:34:10.555]  Biggest theaters.
[02:34:10.955 --> 02:34:11.915]  Really, really nice.
[02:34:12.656 --> 02:34:14.397]  And that's really my favorite.
[02:34:15.057 --> 02:34:17.299]  That's coming up this Monday, 7 o'clock.
[02:34:17.399 --> 02:34:20.621]  I will show Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:34:21.141 --> 02:34:23.523]  And I cut it down from 125 minutes to about 105 minutes.
[02:34:27.745 --> 02:34:33.727]  So, it's a little under two hours, and then I've made a new 35-minute mini-documentary called The Order of Death.
[02:34:33.807 --> 02:34:34.808]  It is really hard-hitting.
[02:34:35.088 --> 02:34:38.509]  It's got that new footage from the fellow that infiltrated the Grove this year.
[02:34:38.529 --> 02:34:39.970]  Oh, a lot of amazing stuff.
[02:34:40.430 --> 02:34:48.973]  It's got where we went out to California the year after, and the people that were protesting us, talking about the occult, they were out there doing witchcraft spells, the local activists.
[02:34:48.993 --> 02:34:50.514]  So, we caught them red-handed.
[02:34:50.554 --> 02:34:52.655]  That's never before been in any film.
[02:34:54.647 --> 02:34:58.931]  And it's just got a bunch of tie-ins with Skull and Bones and the New World Order.
[02:34:59.531 --> 02:35:00.472]  Really hard-hitting.
[02:35:00.492 --> 02:35:02.033]  So we're going to show The Order of Death.
[02:35:02.053 --> 02:35:03.734]  I'm going to give a little speech for The Order of Death.
[02:35:04.935 --> 02:35:06.796]  Show Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[02:35:07.257 --> 02:35:09.038]  And then take a few questions.
[02:35:09.058 --> 02:35:11.460]  It'll be about a three hour, fifteen minute event.
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:12.500]  Eight dollars.
[02:35:14.062 --> 02:35:16.824]  So please come out to the event.
[02:35:16.864 --> 02:35:17.744]  That's Monday.
[02:35:18.225 --> 02:35:19.806]  Alamo Draft House, South Lamar.
[02:35:21.312 --> 02:35:22.772]  One last caller and I'm going to cover some news.
[02:35:23.132 --> 02:35:25.113]  Tim in Ohio, thanks for hanging in there.
[02:35:25.693 --> 02:35:26.833]  Not a problem Alex, how are you doing?
[02:35:27.133 --> 02:35:27.673]  Good, my friend.
[02:35:27.893 --> 02:35:30.954]  I wanted to encourage you there, don't give up on the occasional cigar.
[02:35:30.974 --> 02:35:34.514]  Every once in a while, your birthday, anniversary, release a new film.
[02:35:34.614 --> 02:35:36.355]  You know, I like nicotine too much, man.
[02:35:36.515 --> 02:35:37.235]  I cannot get near it.
[02:35:37.855 --> 02:35:41.336]  Well, you know, I don't really enjoy the taste when I have a cigar, but I love the privacy.
[02:35:41.916 --> 02:35:42.456]  Oh, I do?
[02:35:42.496 --> 02:35:43.616]  What are you, are you kidding?
[02:35:44.456 --> 02:35:45.836]  I absolutely love cigars.
[02:35:46.657 --> 02:35:48.297]  Anyway, I was going to ask you,
[02:35:49.364 --> 02:35:56.469]  You were talking about vaccines earlier, and everyone seems to be pointing towards Roche and Tamiflu.
[02:35:57.070 --> 02:36:00.092]  Yes.
[02:36:01.513 --> 02:36:03.595]  Who is profiting?
[02:36:03.655 --> 02:36:05.716]  The Smedley Butler book comes to mind so much.
[02:36:05.736 --> 02:36:06.156]  I'm sorry.
[02:36:06.217 --> 02:36:07.357]  War is a racket.
[02:36:07.397 --> 02:36:11.641]  The war on terror, the war on crime, the war on viruses, the war on everything.
[02:36:12.161 --> 02:36:12.641]  Right.
[02:36:12.661 --> 02:36:15.463]  They declare war on it, and it gets worse.
[02:36:18.410 --> 02:36:27.453]  Didn't I see on your site, I think maybe in the past year, that two ex-KGB agents were hired for Homeland Security positions?
[02:36:27.513 --> 02:36:29.614]  Yeah, Prima Coff and Marcus Wolfe.
[02:36:30.214 --> 02:36:31.635]  Wolfe was the head of the Stasi.
[02:36:32.095 --> 02:36:33.195]  By the way, that's admitted.
[02:36:33.235 --> 02:36:35.736]  They're helping, and then we see that exact thing.
[02:36:36.356 --> 02:36:39.237]  Cattle on your neighbor, troops will run your life, we're going to surveil you.
[02:36:39.297 --> 02:36:41.598]  I mean, they actually are hiring them.
[02:36:42.438 --> 02:36:43.239]  They have hired them.
[02:36:43.879 --> 02:36:45.660]  Prima Coff's been on the job for three years.
[02:36:45.860 --> 02:36:46.640]  Wolfe for about a year.
[02:36:47.734 --> 02:36:51.575]  And they said no one even cares to know about this.
[02:36:52.655 --> 02:36:54.375]  Well, Stasi, you're good.
[02:36:54.415 --> 02:36:55.056]  You didn't know that?
[02:36:55.496 --> 02:36:56.036]  Oh, yeah, that's right.
[02:36:56.076 --> 02:37:06.798]  I was just, I forget, you know, I was sitting here enjoying my diseased life, my love of family, and my Constitution and Bill of Rights and, uh, let's see, uh, raw pork and 10 packs of cigarettes a day.
[02:37:08.638 --> 02:37:13.139]  Well, you know, uh, that, um, the family is a disease, according to the social workers.
[02:37:14.179 --> 02:37:15.420]  That is their official manual.
[02:37:15.740 --> 02:37:16.300]  Unbelievable.
[02:37:16.320 --> 02:37:17.260]  Thank you, UNESCO.
[02:37:17.896 --> 02:37:20.737]  And Lord Bush for signing us back on to that.
[02:37:21.397 --> 02:37:22.497]  Oh, it's very conservative.
[02:37:22.517 --> 02:37:33.601]  Just like this new lady, folks, covered up all of his activities, the gay porn stars in the White House, the cowboys in the White House, the drugs, all of it.
[02:37:34.201 --> 02:37:40.023]  And she's more liberal than Hillary on the false paradigm, and so the conservatives are absolutely worshipping her right now.
[02:37:40.343 --> 02:37:41.223]  And she's good at it, isn't she?
[02:37:42.243 --> 02:37:42.963]  Yeah, of course.
[02:37:43.004 --> 02:37:44.544]  She totally fits the mold.
[02:37:45.555 --> 02:37:52.960]  I don't know if she's a... Now, when you get down to these low-level minions, you know, because we know that Bush is in above her bloodlines, but what about people like her?
[02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:59.284]  Are there just the people that... Sometimes mid-level minions in the White House are actually in control.
[02:38:00.204 --> 02:38:00.825]  Like Rove.
[02:38:00.965 --> 02:38:01.525]  Rove, yeah.
[02:38:01.685 --> 02:38:02.426]  I know he's very powerful.
[02:38:02.446 --> 02:38:02.986]  Like Kissinger.
[02:38:03.086 --> 02:38:06.709]  So, you know, the President's told what to do, how to jump.
[02:38:06.949 --> 02:38:07.769]  Clinton wasn't.
[02:38:08.910 --> 02:38:12.352]  Reagan was told what to do, and so was Bushy.
[02:38:13.666 --> 02:38:18.149]  Now, weren't they trying to put Rove and kind of something on the hurricane and the flooding?
[02:38:20.111 --> 02:38:22.333]  Oh, yeah, some of the companies and things.
[02:38:22.373 --> 02:38:24.474]  Look, the whole thing's a bit... Thanks for the call.
[02:38:24.694 --> 02:38:26.896]  He would be good for that, though, because he has experience with leaks.
[02:38:27.436 --> 02:38:27.957]  Exactly.
[02:38:27.977 --> 02:38:30.379]  I appreciate the call.
[02:38:31.620 --> 02:38:35.062]  Everything Bush said in his speech, it's all lies.
[02:38:36.003 --> 02:38:37.704]  I mean, he got up there in the French Quarter.
[02:38:38.024 --> 02:38:39.926]  They brought in generators, turned the lights on.
[02:38:40.286 --> 02:38:41.667]  They said, oh, look, the lights are on now.
[02:38:41.747 --> 02:38:42.588]  Boy, they did that quick.
[02:38:43.473 --> 02:38:47.755]  And he said, we're only going to give contracts to in-state, local contractors.
[02:38:49.115 --> 02:38:55.258]  There have been, like, I was reading the other day, there was two, now it's four good-sized contracts out of several hundred.
[02:38:55.758 --> 02:39:00.340]  And I got another report here today, oh, Houston Chronicles, one, what's that other one?
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:01.560]  I'll have to dig it out.
[02:39:02.040 --> 02:39:08.083]  Where, you know, he's all going to Halliburton and Bechtel and foreign companies.
[02:39:09.483 --> 02:39:10.144]  It's pathetic.
[02:39:10.164 --> 02:39:11.264]  I mean, I'm almost speechless.
[02:39:11.324 --> 02:39:13.045]  It's just all lies!
[02:39:14.756 --> 02:39:16.579]  It's all lies!
[02:39:16.719 --> 02:39:17.740]  It's not true!
[02:39:17.760 --> 02:39:21.925]  Let me just cover news, okay?
[02:39:22.466 --> 02:39:26.491]  I covered some of this in the first hour, but let's recap what we did cover and then get into the stuff we didn't cover.
[02:39:27.012 --> 02:39:29.996]  US to host international conference on bird flu.
[02:39:31.400 --> 02:39:31.800]  The U.S.
[02:39:31.840 --> 02:39:41.743]  government will host an international conference this week, bringing together over 65 countries on the bird flu virus in a bid to streamline international response to a possible global pandemic.
[02:39:42.063 --> 02:39:48.345]  A government spokesman said, yeah, see, they can pull the crisis in a foreign country and then use that as a way to lock down the nation.
[02:39:48.665 --> 02:39:51.346]  And if that happens, you watch, the borders will still be open.
[02:39:51.806 --> 02:39:55.127]  You'll just get troops aiming guns at you, you know, in downtown Kansas City.
[02:39:55.848 --> 02:39:59.049]  It's all about letting you know how to be a slave, you know, training you to be a slave.
[02:39:59.089 --> 02:40:00.429]  This is the bathing in the tyranny.
[02:40:01.264 --> 02:40:08.069]  Seven people have died of bird flu, or the H5N1, of the avian flu in Indonesia, while 43 have been killed in Vietnam, 12 in Thailand, and 4 in Cambodia.
[02:40:19.341 --> 02:40:21.122]  Creates deadly plagues to kill us, I would add.
[02:40:21.502 --> 02:40:31.206]  Fears the H5N1 strain will mutate, acquiring genes from the human influenza virus that could make it highly infectious and lethal to millions in a global pandemic.
[02:40:31.226 --> 02:40:47.553]  And the reason they say that is because in China and other Asian countries, they let the human feces and other, uh, affluent, uh, other, uh, detritus pool in large, large
[02:40:48.075 --> 02:41:13.216]  ponds that they then dry out and use in their rice patties and it is really disgusting and the viruses do merge in there but this has been going on forever and uh... again even the Spanish flu was because of horrible malnutrition and the evidence clearly shows most deaths were in the battlefields and it looks like biological weapons were being used but it is also Urge Calm saying
[02:41:14.758 --> 02:41:20.602]  Investigations into Indonesia have produced no evidence that H5N1 was spreading easily from person to person.
[02:41:21.623 --> 02:41:24.005]  Well, actually, the investigations, they don't even know.
[02:41:24.025 --> 02:41:25.386]  They think it might have caused it.
[02:41:25.486 --> 02:41:25.726]  Okay?
[02:41:25.866 --> 02:41:26.426]  Think it might have.
[02:41:28.348 --> 02:41:33.491]  The World Health Organization fears H5N1 strain will mutate, acquiring genes from the human influenza.
[02:41:34.312 --> 02:41:36.894]  State Department spokesman Sean McCormick said the U.S.
[02:41:36.954 --> 02:41:40.356]  hosted conference would kick off Thursday and run through Friday.
[02:41:40.396 --> 02:41:41.657]  So, lots of fear-mongering.
[02:41:43.420 --> 02:41:49.526]  On that, the official UN plan is to use food as a weapon and bioweapons as a weapon and do this to us.
[02:41:50.247 --> 02:41:54.111]  And now the government has created, the laboratory has created the artificial
[02:41:56.465 --> 02:41:58.607]  Spanish Flu Influenza of 1918.
[02:41:58.667 --> 02:42:03.011]  Of course, we already dug it up five years ago from a dead whaler near the North Pole.
[02:42:03.511 --> 02:42:06.274]  Killer Flu 1918 caused by bird virus.
[02:42:06.674 --> 02:42:07.875]  Financial Times of London.
[02:42:08.015 --> 02:42:09.356]  All this coming out at one time.
[02:42:09.817 --> 02:42:20.906]  The virus responsible for the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide, has been reconstructed by genetic engineers in a highly high-security U.S.
[02:42:20.966 --> 02:42:21.527]  laboratory.
[02:42:22.515 --> 02:42:26.750]  Permanent studies show that it is an avian flu virus.
[02:42:28.166 --> 02:42:29.367]  See, I can't read, I'm sorry.
[02:42:29.467 --> 02:42:42.915]  Preliminary studies show that it is the avian flu virus that mutated to spread quickly between people, just as many experts fear what will happen soon with the current H5N1 strain of bird flu in Asia.
[02:42:43.396 --> 02:42:45.077]  So, right there we catch them red-handed.
[02:42:45.337 --> 02:42:46.898]  They dig this up five years ago.
[02:42:46.958 --> 02:42:53.602]  We predict on this show that they'll announce it's re-emerged and no one will point out that they just so happen to have dug it up.
[02:42:54.142 --> 02:42:55.183]  And they don't do that here either.
[02:42:55.203 --> 02:43:09.595]  They just say, oh, we just so happen to have manufactured artificially, yeah, out of the real virus, they don't mention that, but it's in the actual scientific journals, and then, oh, by the way, it's going to re-emerge and kill everybody, give all your rights up, we need to get rid of posse comitatus, but the border stays wide open.
[02:43:10.295 --> 02:43:13.918]  I mean, how transparent does it have to get?
[02:43:14.599 --> 02:43:19.783]  Just right there in plain view, the headline should be, the government creates it and suddenly it's on the loose.
[02:43:23.194 --> 02:43:24.154]  If you believe any of it.
[02:43:24.674 --> 02:43:29.096]  And, you know, they caught this Marine supposedly stealing stuff and giving it to the Philippine government.
[02:43:29.936 --> 02:43:33.857]  And they're running around going, it's the first ever spy case in the White House.
[02:43:34.197 --> 02:43:35.598]  This is untold.
[02:43:35.658 --> 02:43:36.618]  This is unmoving.
[02:43:36.878 --> 02:43:38.419]  The traitorousness of it.
[02:43:39.319 --> 02:43:46.481]  Folks, the government is so corrupt that over ten million dollars a year is stolen at the Pentagon alone.
[02:43:47.404 --> 02:43:53.349]  They openly will just order hundreds of computers and then just sell them out the backs of trucks at half price.
[02:43:53.950 --> 02:43:56.732]  And that's just low-level corruption.
[02:43:56.992 --> 02:43:58.694]  You know, $30,000 expense cards.
[02:43:58.714 --> 02:44:01.076]  You know, buying giant diamond necklaces for their wives.
[02:44:01.376 --> 02:44:05.199]  And the Pentagon lets the brass do it, because then they're compromising.
[02:44:05.239 --> 02:44:10.704]  Gotta keep quiet about the trillions in theft that have gone on in the last ten years.
[02:44:10.904 --> 02:44:15.648]  And we have congressional hearings on that, where Rumsfeld admits that's happened, but says nothing's gonna be done about it.
[02:44:17.483 --> 02:44:19.724]  So, again, it's just classic.
[02:44:20.404 --> 02:44:25.287]  Stealing, spying, I mean, there are offices in the Pentagon openly run by Israel.
[02:44:25.707 --> 02:44:34.831]  Where the most... Israel, the Israeli government, owns the company that runs the super secure encoding lines from the White House to the Pentagon and every other federal office.
[02:44:34.851 --> 02:44:39.734]  And you're like, well, Israel's our God, so we have to let them do that.
[02:44:40.114 --> 02:44:43.355]  Folks, you know I have nothing even against Israel, and I get criticized for saying that.
[02:44:44.536 --> 02:44:46.697]  I have problems with the stuff they do.
[02:44:47.700 --> 02:44:50.084]  And so everybody's freaking out about this Filipino.
[02:44:50.805 --> 02:44:51.786]  I mean, that's nothing.
[02:44:52.968 --> 02:45:02.161]  It's horrible what he's done, but our government is basically merged, like Siamese twins, with Israel.
[02:45:03.135 --> 02:45:04.836]  And they openly do whatever they want.
[02:45:04.876 --> 02:45:11.678]  I mean, we've interviewed people from the Pentagon who've retired, where literally Israelis walk into their offices in uniform and scream orders at them.
[02:45:12.118 --> 02:45:14.999]  Everyone actually runs around following their orders.
[02:45:15.679 --> 02:45:19.800]  So when Sharon says on the radio that we're their slaves, I mean, it's true.
[02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:24.582]  Not the Jewish people's slaves, but slaves of a cabal in Israel.
[02:45:25.262 --> 02:45:26.622]  And the globalists control them.
[02:45:26.642 --> 02:45:28.623]  You have to understand, it's going up the pyramid.
[02:45:30.080 --> 02:45:31.361]  And we're not supposed to talk about it.
[02:45:31.381 --> 02:45:32.281]  Well, here's BBC.
[02:45:32.661 --> 02:45:35.562]  Pentagon man guilty in spy probe.
[02:45:35.582 --> 02:45:41.585]  A former Pentagon analyst has pled guilty to passing classified information to pro-Israel lobbyists.
[02:45:41.665 --> 02:45:45.627]  Larry Franklin said he had been unhappy with aspects of U.S.
[02:45:45.647 --> 02:45:50.369]  foreign policy and hoped the lobbyists would use their contacts to get things changed.
[02:45:53.370 --> 02:45:54.090]  Wow!
[02:45:54.230 --> 02:45:54.610]  So, see?
[02:45:54.630 --> 02:45:55.611]  He was just trying to help.
[02:45:56.607 --> 02:45:58.168]  Franklin and, of course, get a bunch of money, too.
[02:45:58.248 --> 02:45:58.869]  It's never bad.
[02:45:58.889 --> 02:46:08.137]  58, you know, they always help the KGB, too, because they, you know, I've got a million bucks from the KGB, they say, but, you know, I really did it because I thought America was doing it wrong.
[02:46:08.658 --> 02:46:12.921]  Franklin, this is what these traitors always say, he needs to be strung up, but nothing will happen to him.
[02:46:13.302 --> 02:46:20.388]  Franklin, 58, said he had also given information to an Israeli diplomat that played down its importance, and it says nothing new.
[02:46:21.184 --> 02:46:29.087]  Franklin told the Virginia court on Wednesday that he had given defense information to officials from the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, or APAC, from 2002-2004.
[02:46:29.147 --> 02:46:30.428]  Well, of course it's not!
[02:46:30.768 --> 02:46:41.952]  Notice they'll prosecute some guy who's done some pretty treacherous stuff, but they can have offices sitting above our brass with Israelis actually running the Pentagon.
[02:46:42.532 --> 02:46:43.993]  People with dual citizenship.
[02:46:44.173 --> 02:46:46.654]  But in many cases, they're actually just Israeli citizens.
[02:46:49.281 --> 02:46:56.144]  I remember in urban warfare training they just had a few Israeli officers there and they were advising the Marines how to deal with the American people.
[02:46:56.544 --> 02:46:58.365]  Look, I'm not putting up with it, okay?
[02:46:58.605 --> 02:47:00.666]  We're not going to live like the Palestinians over here.
[02:47:01.286 --> 02:47:03.987]  You may think you're going to do it, but it's not going to happen.
[02:47:04.827 --> 02:47:05.087]  Okay?
[02:47:05.147 --> 02:47:07.708]  It's just, you're not going to get rid of composite commentators.
[02:47:07.988 --> 02:47:10.189]  You're not going to have us with ID cards and leave our houses.
[02:47:10.449 --> 02:47:11.550]  You're not going to get our guns.
[02:47:11.570 --> 02:47:12.970]  And we're not going to be your slaves.
[02:47:13.431 --> 02:47:14.991]  Just understand it.
[02:47:15.391 --> 02:47:16.972]  We're not going to live like they live in England.
[02:47:17.272 --> 02:47:18.673]  We're not going to live like they live in Germany.
[02:47:18.893 --> 02:47:20.173]  We're not going to live like they live in Russia.
[02:47:20.193 --> 02:47:21.794]  We're not going to live like they live in Israel.
[02:47:22.194 --> 02:47:23.195]  It ain't going to happen.
[02:47:25.236 --> 02:47:30.778]  So again, as usual, they'll attack some petty story of Israeli spies, but not the real meat and potatoes.
[02:47:32.788 --> 02:47:33.108]  Bush!
[02:47:33.228 --> 02:47:36.189]  Militants seek to intimidate the world.
[02:47:36.209 --> 02:47:38.590]  He gave a ridiculous speech today trying to fearmonger.
[02:47:38.910 --> 02:47:39.670]  It's not going to work.
[02:47:40.490 --> 02:47:42.311]  Our government created the radical Islamist system.
[02:47:42.331 --> 02:47:43.731]  It's an absolute historical fact.
[02:47:44.731 --> 02:47:51.513]  Going back to spies, what about Bill Clinton and all the communist Chinese generals and thousands of faxes and emails out of the Commerce Department?
[02:47:51.533 --> 02:47:57.215]  And Chinese generals would openly have a company give a half a million bucks to Clinton and right then he'd give them documents.
[02:47:57.788 --> 02:48:01.030]  George Bush protected him and blocked Van Burten's committee.
[02:48:01.270 --> 02:48:02.831]  You see, this is what I'm sick of!
[02:48:02.911 --> 02:48:05.273]  Bill Clinton and Bushes are in business!
[02:48:06.774 --> 02:48:13.358]  You... The fools out there riding around with Bill Clinton stickers on your car or George Bush stickers on your car, pull them off, you idiots!
[02:48:15.059 --> 02:48:15.539]  I'm sorry.
[02:48:17.740 --> 02:48:20.422]  I'm just really upset about them trying to destroy America.
[02:48:20.742 --> 02:48:24.725]  GOP doubts, uh... build over court choice.
[02:48:24.765 --> 02:48:26.606]  Well, they must be evil Al Qaeda members too.
[02:48:27.310 --> 02:48:29.033]  They don't like the new Supreme Court nominee.
[02:48:29.053 --> 02:48:29.654]  Well, how dare them?
[02:48:30.034 --> 02:48:30.735]  Some good news.
[02:48:30.775 --> 02:48:34.321]  Texas Republican introduces measure to tighten border security.
[02:48:35.362 --> 02:48:36.925]  We'll tell you about that when we get back.
[02:48:36.965 --> 02:48:41.692]  And a bunch of other key news and information as we continue this transmission against tyranny.
[02:48:45.836 --> 02:48:50.180]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:54.804]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.944 --> 02:48:59.287]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.347 --> 02:49:00.729]  The New World Order.
[02:49:01.169 --> 02:49:02.791]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.206 --> 02:49:26.631]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.831 --> 02:49:32.214]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:51:01.727 --> 02:51:02.128]  I think so.
[02:51:21.906 --> 02:51:22.166]  I think so.
[02:51:56.661 --> 02:51:59.545]  You know, there's been an encore.
[02:52:00.126 --> 02:52:03.791]  Ted Anderson just came in here and said that his dad used to sing that song.
[02:52:05.414 --> 02:52:09.219]  And that was very nostalgic, so... I'm not a good singer, folks.
[02:52:09.259 --> 02:52:11.623]  It was a joke earlier when I was singing a Johnny Cash song.
[02:52:12.430 --> 02:52:19.893]  I hear the train a-comin', it's rollin' round the bend, and I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
[02:52:20.233 --> 02:52:24.815]  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison, and time keeps draggin' on.
[02:52:25.536 --> 02:52:27.036]  All right, there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:27.536 --> 02:52:28.717]  Totally obnoxious.
[02:52:29.277 --> 02:52:30.878]  All right, Texas Republican.
[02:52:32.046 --> 02:52:36.567]  And that train keeps a-movin' on down to San Antone.
[02:52:37.047 --> 02:52:45.009]  When I was just a baby, my mama told me, son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns.
[02:52:45.029 --> 02:52:46.310]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:52:48.670 --> 02:52:49.730]  Turtle laughing, I can't do it.
[02:52:50.271 --> 02:52:53.591]  Alright, Texas gotta have some fun here.
[02:52:54.772 --> 02:52:59.973]  But I shot a man in Reno, just to watch him die.
[02:53:01.460 --> 02:53:01.981]  All right.
[02:53:03.122 --> 02:53:07.186]  Texas Republican introduces measure to tighten border security.
[02:53:07.646 --> 02:53:15.935]  With complaints mounting about lax border control, Senator Kay Demon Bailey Hutchinson misses microphone in Austin.
[02:53:16.255 --> 02:53:18.017]  Mrs. Transponder.
[02:53:19.031 --> 02:53:29.159]  Called Wednesday for giving local police the power to arrest illegal immigrants and with the creation of a border marshal program to let local peace officers help patrol the border.
[02:53:29.579 --> 02:53:32.842]  And I just attacked Kay Bailey because she's bad news, but let me tell you something.
[02:53:33.322 --> 02:53:37.085]  If this is a real bill, I gotta go read it, I will worship her.
[02:53:37.465 --> 02:53:38.466]  At least on this issue.
[02:53:38.887 --> 02:53:40.488]  No, that's blasphemous, I mean sarcastic.
[02:53:41.449 --> 02:53:46.893]  Absolutely, local police need to be able to arrest them, and they do have the power.
[02:53:47.662 --> 02:53:50.003]  There'll probably be some federal thing to limit them, actually.
[02:53:50.744 --> 02:53:51.904]  But no, there needs to be an order.
[02:53:52.625 --> 02:53:57.408]  And for the creation of a border marshal program to let local peace officers help patrol the border.
[02:53:57.788 --> 02:53:59.569]  How about some federal money?
[02:53:59.989 --> 02:54:02.070]  You're actually supposed to do that constitutionally.
[02:54:02.531 --> 02:54:05.152]  Oh, the Fed said $20 billion a year for the border, extra.
[02:54:05.592 --> 02:54:09.074]  I'd go, yes, raise my taxes, give it to me.
[02:54:10.175 --> 02:54:11.336]  You can tell I'm having fun here, folks.
[02:54:11.376 --> 02:54:14.177]  I'm going to stop it.
[02:54:14.197 --> 02:54:15.998]  But that's one of the three things they're supposed to do.
[02:54:19.476 --> 02:54:21.077]  LULAC is totally freaking out.
[02:54:21.677 --> 02:54:24.639]  The Executive Director of LULAC is calling it evil and horrible.
[02:54:25.379 --> 02:54:28.701]  Oh, so the government controlling the borders is evil and horrible now.
[02:54:29.741 --> 02:54:29.901]  C.I.E.
[02:54:30.302 --> 02:54:34.984]  Chief refuses to seek discipline for 9-1-1 officials.
[02:54:36.365 --> 02:54:39.206]  Fresh bombs shake Iraqi capital.
[02:54:39.286 --> 02:54:43.028]  Suicide bomber blew himself up on a bus near the oil ministry.
[02:54:43.389 --> 02:54:44.309]  You mean S.A.S.
[02:54:44.349 --> 02:54:45.750]  or Delta Force put a bomb on board?
[02:54:46.414 --> 02:54:48.876]  In Central Baghdad killing at least 10 Iraqis.
[02:54:50.478 --> 02:54:50.958]  U.S.
[02:54:51.919 --> 02:54:53.801]  aiming at Syria regime change.
[02:54:53.861 --> 02:54:55.342]  This is the London Telegraph.
[02:54:55.362 --> 02:54:55.843]  Listen to this.
[02:54:57.564 --> 02:55:05.371]  Israel predicted yesterday that America would impose fresh sanctions on Syria in an attempt to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad.
[02:55:06.732 --> 02:55:08.594]  And it says Saul Mozav
[02:55:09.582 --> 02:55:23.031]  The Defense Minister said he believed sanctions would follow publication of a United Nations report expected to implicate senior Syrian officials in the murder of Rafiq al-Hariri, the former Lebanese Prime Minister.
[02:55:23.667 --> 02:55:26.009]  And the evidence is that the West did that.
[02:55:26.449 --> 02:55:30.051]  I won't be surprised if Syria gets a red card, the General said.
[02:55:30.471 --> 02:55:45.361]  He told Israeli Radio, the United States will take actions against Syria, beginning with economic sanctions and moving on to others, that will make it clear to the Syrians that their policies do not comply with the UN and the US New World Order.
[02:55:46.181 --> 02:55:48.363]  But it says the UN and US New World Order
[02:55:51.036 --> 02:55:55.337]  Or the prohibition of sovereign states to support terrorism.
[02:55:56.618 --> 02:55:58.979]  Well, our New World Order!
[02:55:59.539 --> 02:56:02.000]  But Rush Limbaugh says it doesn't exist!
[02:56:03.100 --> 02:56:09.842]  It doesn't exist in your Al-Shi'aida, the Harvard Review said, if you talk about it.
[02:56:10.662 --> 02:56:13.623]  I mean, all we're doing is covering the formation of a one-world government.
[02:56:14.344 --> 02:56:16.784]  Assad is a little pathetic nobody, groveling.
[02:56:17.525 --> 02:56:18.765]  He doesn't threaten anyone.
[02:56:20.037 --> 02:56:21.177]  That's why they're gonna push him over.
[02:56:21.778 --> 02:56:23.758]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, God bless you.
