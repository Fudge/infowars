[00:00:05.828 --> 00:00:06.470]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:08.194]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.916 --> 00:00:09.999]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.482]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.244 --> 00:00:13.046]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.826 --> 00:00:17.768]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.988 --> 00:00:22.090]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.291 --> 00:00:32.476]  I want to see us living free lives.
[00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:38.119]  Being able to determine our destinies to the greatest extent possible.
[00:00:39.557 --> 00:00:46.141]  I want the veils, the frauds, the lies to be torn away from your eyes for you to see the truth.
[00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:59.810]  And the truth is, we have an elite that sees us as animals, as cattle, as spare parts that has absolutely no compassion or love for anyone but themselves.
[00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:08.635]  The religion of the New World Order overlords and social engineers is a religion of death.
[00:01:09.193 --> 00:01:14.798]  And the merciless exercise of power over populations.
[00:01:15.838 --> 00:01:24.105]  The culture, the political terms that we've been given are as false as Neo's matrix.
[00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:29.710]  The world around you predominantly is a fraud.
[00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.932]  But it's only a veneer.
[00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:34.374]  The truth is everywhere.
[00:01:35.494 --> 00:01:38.457]  The truth is self-evident.
[00:01:40.416 --> 00:01:41.397]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:01:41.457 --> 00:01:43.818]  It is the 8th day of August 2005.
[00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:48.541]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:01:49.501 --> 00:01:51.662]  We're going to be here for the next three hours.
[00:01:51.702 --> 00:01:53.483]  We're going to have wide open phones.
[00:01:55.044 --> 00:02:00.247]  The mother of a Gulf War II vet who died, Cindy Sheehan, will be joining us.
[00:02:00.307 --> 00:02:04.670]  Of course, she's been on the network before, been here on the broadcast before.
[00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.392]  She met with Lord Bush over a year ago.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.782]  And, of course, she told the story of his cavalier response.
[00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:20.165]  She's been out at Crawford protesting against the war, and the neocons are calling her names and savaging her and attacking her.
[00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:25.987]  So now even dead soldiers' mothers can be attacked.
[00:02:26.608 --> 00:02:27.688]  She didn't give enough.
[00:02:27.828 --> 00:02:28.549]  She's evil.
[00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.611]  And that's what they're saying about her drudging others and trying to twist and lie.
[00:02:34.364 --> 00:02:37.946]  It's just a classic, classic New World Order activities.
[00:02:37.986 --> 00:02:40.408]  They have to dehumanize her.
[00:02:41.068 --> 00:02:41.989]  They have to attack her.
[00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:43.570]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.133]  The more propaganda they lay on, the more their system fails.
[00:02:48.673 --> 00:02:59.700]  I watched a little bit of Fox News this Sunday, and they were on there going, the American people haven't sacrificed enough, but they're going to sacrifice when Al-Qaeda hits us.
[00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.792]  They have these intelligence analysts up there, and it was chilling.
[00:03:04.313 --> 00:03:06.674]  We've got to teach them about sacrifice.
[00:03:07.355 --> 00:03:08.636]  It's their fault.
[00:03:09.016 --> 00:03:12.238]  It's their fault that the Iraqis aren't worshipping us.
[00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.342]  But once we carry out terror attacks, they'll learn to love us.
[00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:19.683]  They'll learn to support what we're doing.
[00:03:19.743 --> 00:03:23.366]  These cattle don't have the same vision as we do.
[00:03:24.587 --> 00:03:26.268]  I could see right into these people's eyes.
[00:03:27.068 --> 00:03:27.708]  They love it.
[00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.391]  They love manipulating us, and they get very angry when you don't buy their fraud.
[00:03:33.632 --> 00:03:35.473]  They get very angry when you see through them.
[00:03:36.753 --> 00:03:41.156]  We've got a detailed article up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoAwards.com.
[00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:45.658]  7-7 bombings, final word, Her Majesty's Terrorist Network.
[00:03:45.698 --> 00:03:50.220]  I want to go over that, kind of a roundup of all the evidence showing it was an inside job.
[00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:54.163]  ABC News anchor Peter Jennings dies at 67.
[00:03:55.507 --> 00:03:57.369]  And I've been watching that guy most of my life.
[00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:00.111]  Hard to believe Peter Jennings is gone.
[00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:04.295]  A very slick, very intelligent, very manipulative individual.
[00:04:05.556 --> 00:04:06.857]  But I can't deny it.
[00:04:06.897 --> 00:04:08.418]  I'm a little sad that he's dead.
[00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:12.241]  It lets us all know how transitory and short life is.
[00:04:13.002 --> 00:04:16.024]  So, c'est la vie, sayonara, bon voyage.
[00:04:17.686 --> 00:04:18.426]  Have a good one.
[00:04:18.446 --> 00:04:20.889]  Hopefully see you on the other side, Peter.
[00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:23.671]  Boy, he died quick, didn't he?
[00:04:24.617 --> 00:04:27.240]  Watch for women and child bombers!
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.761]  Yes, they could be.
[00:04:28.801 --> 00:04:32.164]  I remember a few years ago, FEMA said, watch for pregnant women.
[00:04:32.324 --> 00:04:32.825]  Preached.
[00:04:33.245 --> 00:04:35.988]  Why, anyone could be a terrorist, and all crime is terrible.
[00:04:36.028 --> 00:04:38.530]  Now, watch for women, watch for children.
[00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.991]  They could be with Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:40.752 --> 00:04:42.013]  Yes, everyone's with Al-Qaeda.
[00:04:43.374 --> 00:04:44.215]  Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:04:45.136 --> 00:04:46.918]  Folks, there's just so much news today.
[00:04:46.978 --> 00:04:47.859]  It's just massive.
[00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:50.081]  It's all coming up on the other side.
[00:04:51.272 --> 00:04:52.075]  And your call is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:52.095 --> 00:04:53.399]  Don't forget InfoWars.net and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:05:02.682 --> 00:05:05.543]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.803 --> 00:05:07.384]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.724 --> 00:05:12.387]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.747 --> 00:05:17.149]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.589 --> 00:05:21.751]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.991 --> 00:05:24.833]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.913 --> 00:05:29.597]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.797 --> 00:05:34.200]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.666]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.906 --> 00:05:44.328]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.488 --> 00:05:46.089]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.116]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:06:02.657 --> 00:06:11.723]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.984 --> 00:06:23.211]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:23.552 --> 00:06:28.555]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury and aluminum are
[00:06:28.635 --> 00:06:29.276]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:29.496 --> 00:06:29.756]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:29.796 --> 00:06:30.096]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:58.198 --> 00:07:07.866]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine, and I want to tell you about the Sacro Wedgie.
[00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:10.789]  I don't endorse many products, but I'm endorsing this one.
[00:07:11.109 --> 00:07:18.196]  If you've got back pain, sciatica, hip pain, leg pain, knee pain, then you need to listen very closely to this message.
[00:07:18.638 --> 00:07:26.723]  For more than 10 years now, the Sacro Wedgie has helped thousands find relief from the symptoms and pain of back problems.
[00:07:27.084 --> 00:07:28.985]  Now, all you have to do is go to their website.
[00:07:29.245 --> 00:07:31.527]  You can read the testimonials and read all about it.
[00:07:32.067 --> 00:07:35.930]  On the Internet, it is sacrowedgie.com.
[00:07:36.390 --> 00:07:41.293]  S-A-C-R-O-W-E-D-G-Y dot com.
[00:07:41.473 --> 00:07:43.014]  Sacrowedgie.com.
[00:07:43.475 --> 00:07:44.876]  Or you can use the toll-free number.
[00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:44.956]  1-800-737-9000
[00:07:48.558 --> 00:07:48.898]  Call them.
[00:07:48.918 --> 00:07:51.281]  It's only $29.95, and it really works.
[00:08:08.952 --> 00:08:10.053]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.713 --> 00:08:11.534]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.274 --> 00:08:14.215]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.235 --> 00:08:17.778]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.038 --> 00:08:22.160]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.563]  Think about all the striving.
[00:08:27.884 --> 00:08:32.066]  The blood, the sweat, the tears, the pain, the enslavement.
[00:08:33.487 --> 00:08:37.550]  The exultation, the trailblazing, the discoveries.
[00:08:39.386 --> 00:08:52.855]  Everything our species has done, everything our species is and has the potential to become in danger because the elite is threatened by ingenuity.
[00:08:53.576 --> 00:08:56.178]  The elite is threatened by innovation.
[00:08:56.858 --> 00:09:06.665]  The elite is threatened by beauty and strength and love and fealty and honor and wisdom and sacrifice.
[00:09:09.068 --> 00:09:10.909]  They are threatened by the life force.
[00:09:10.929 --> 00:09:18.713]  They are threatened by the driving, bustling, uncontained striving of Homo sapiens sapiens.
[00:09:19.854 --> 00:09:21.955]  We are now the kings of this world.
[00:09:22.816 --> 00:09:26.137]  We are now the gods of this world.
[00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:28.639]  We are now the super species.
[00:09:30.529 --> 00:09:41.241]  We have dominated all life forms on this planet, except for those of the very smallest and most minute and most powerful order, the microorganism.
[00:09:42.483 --> 00:09:44.144]  We are the super species.
[00:09:46.948 --> 00:09:49.791]  And now we have a tiny subspecies, the elite.
[00:09:51.167 --> 00:10:17.346]  The darkest, most wicked, most cunning, most manipulative, most hateful, most sardonic, most macabre crew of cancerous, mutated, spiritually, physically, mentally inbred individuals in control trying to literally rest our development process
[00:10:17.811 --> 00:10:29.719]  Away from the natural order and attempt to bring us under heel forever and dumb us down and turn us into mindless, gibbering servants to worship them!
[00:10:29.739 --> 00:10:33.381]  They think they're God!
[00:10:38.384 --> 00:10:41.666]  And they love to press on the nerve of power.
[00:10:41.726 --> 00:10:44.128]  They love to just raw, uncontrollable,
[00:10:45.308 --> 00:10:48.989]  Adulterated, unhindered exercise of power.
[00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:58.913]  It's a red button, a lever, a wheel they must push or pull or turn or force or fire.
[00:11:00.513 --> 00:11:11.677]  We are here now under attack, being warped, being poisoned, being attacked and being savaged by the greatest minds, by the most
[00:11:12.495 --> 00:11:29.364]  Focused scientific institutions who compete, who literally have competitions of who can dumb us down the best and who can manipulate us and who can track us and who can break us down and understand us.
[00:11:30.535 --> 00:11:55.807]  And everything's going into an automated, computerized, mechanized system of control where a tiny elite will not even have to count on its physical human soldiers anymore, but will control the population through the automated grid of death designed and ready to ensanguate the human soul, to suck us dry like a giant black widow spider sucks a beetle dry.
[00:11:58.976 --> 00:12:12.522]  Like a tarantula sucks a sparrow dry, I see the cage, the mechanisms clicking into place, the greedy eyes of the controllers.
[00:12:14.703 --> 00:12:16.403]  They must fail!
[00:12:18.584 --> 00:12:22.166]  But for them to fail, we must feel stirring in us the deep,
[00:12:23.963 --> 00:12:26.786]  Drive of the species to survive.
[00:12:27.126 --> 00:12:28.828]  The coding that God gave us.
[00:12:29.509 --> 00:12:44.623]  That resistance, that beautiful design that will cause us to find the cracks around these walls and to take control of the citadels of power and to cast down these orbs of evil.
[00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:59.188]  This is what I've read in the last two days, and this is the constant admission.
[00:13:00.089 --> 00:13:00.949]  London Telegraph.
[00:13:01.029 --> 00:13:04.290]  Mobile phones can trigger eye damage, fear scientists.
[00:13:05.491 --> 00:13:08.252]  There are literally hundreds of major studies by governments, universities.
[00:13:08.312 --> 00:13:08.952]  It's conclusive.
[00:13:09.012 --> 00:13:11.333]  It fires microwave energy.
[00:13:12.573 --> 00:13:15.914]  Heating the brain over two degrees in a ten-minute phone call.
[00:13:17.215 --> 00:13:18.515]  Heating the tissues.
[00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:31.936]  And causing massive damage to the delicate workings of the eyeball and its parts.
[00:13:34.956 --> 00:13:44.779]  It's admitted, and I'm going to use a cell phone today, and I'm going to hold it up to my head, and I'm going to cook my head just like Peter Jennings smoked those cigarettes.
[00:13:45.179 --> 00:13:46.979]  Two luscious packages a day.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:48.800]  He would have lived to be 90.
[00:13:50.502 --> 00:13:54.505]  No, he just couldn't believe it was hurting him, so he sucked the cigarette.
[00:13:54.985 --> 00:13:55.825]  He sucked it.
[00:13:56.186 --> 00:14:04.451]  He sucked the carbon monoxide and the tar and the nicotine, the luscious poison, into his lungs, just like I've done for so many years.
[00:14:06.312 --> 00:14:07.132]  Don't smoke now.
[00:14:07.152 --> 00:14:17.599]  And every once in a while, I still take the tap water and drink the fluoride and the mercury and the poisons and the toxins and the dead bacteria.
[00:14:19.133 --> 00:14:25.958]  But why don't I plug a wireless set onto my ear with just a low frequency radio wave that doesn't cause any damage?
[00:14:27.619 --> 00:14:30.381]  Why do I still hold a microwave up to my head?
[00:14:31.362 --> 00:14:32.683]  Because everybody does it.
[00:14:34.885 --> 00:14:36.145]  Because I'm not conscious.
[00:14:36.206 --> 00:14:37.166]  Because it's easy.
[00:14:37.807 --> 00:14:39.748]  Because I lose the earpiece.
[00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:45.512]  And because I don't like to use my new phone because it's satellite tracked.
[00:14:46.033 --> 00:14:46.433]  Admittedly.
[00:14:47.125 --> 00:14:48.826]  I have my old phone that works even better.
[00:14:48.846 --> 00:14:51.867]  It has even more powerful transmitter in it.
[00:14:53.588 --> 00:14:56.909]  You see, I sit here and talk the talk and I walk the walk in many ways.
[00:14:57.489 --> 00:15:00.130]  This is one example of the death all around you.
[00:15:00.450 --> 00:15:07.493]  You're going to buy your teenage 14-year-old daughter or son that cell phone and you're going to sit there and you're going to watch them kill themselves.
[00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:14.436]  When you're dying of a brain tumor in 10 years and your children are over the bed and as you die from it,
[00:15:15.091 --> 00:15:17.673]  Will you remind them not to put the phone to their head?
[00:15:17.693 --> 00:15:21.276]  And why do the elite allow us to have these devices?
[00:15:21.356 --> 00:15:22.277]  Why do they do this?
[00:15:22.337 --> 00:15:30.483]  Why do they... A teenager throws a rock playing 11 years old and gets charged as a criminal for throwing a pebble.
[00:15:32.403 --> 00:15:36.104]  But the government sets up checkpoints to see if we're wearing our seatbelts.
[00:15:36.204 --> 00:15:38.745]  And their own federal documents admit it's not to check for seatbelts.
[00:15:38.965 --> 00:15:40.525]  It's to train us to accepting search.
[00:15:41.026 --> 00:15:43.166]  They don't care about something that's killing us en masse.
[00:15:43.726 --> 00:15:46.427]  Cancer is exploding, doubling every ten years.
[00:15:46.727 --> 00:15:47.587]  How is it happening?
[00:15:47.908 --> 00:15:49.928]  Sperm count's plunging to almost nothing.
[00:15:50.368 --> 00:15:52.789]  Whole areas of the ocean, the plankton's dying.
[00:15:56.536 --> 00:15:59.238]  But the environmentalists are there to take your farm or ranch.
[00:15:59.519 --> 00:16:04.543]  They're not there to stop the genetic engineering that's taking over the entire biosphere.
[00:16:06.745 --> 00:16:07.005]  See?
[00:16:09.267 --> 00:16:10.969]  No, no, no.
[00:16:11.409 --> 00:16:23.660]  Eckhart's busy because a happy father with no criminal record kisses his two-month-old baby on the stomach and mommy takes a photograph and so they put him in jail for six months.
[00:16:25.822 --> 00:16:42.216]  But meanwhile, known top pedophiles run the Department of Health and Human Services in Florida and openly kidnap children and nothing's done.
[00:16:42.236 --> 00:16:43.357]  Beginning to figure this out?
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:49.703]  Mobile phones can trigger eye damage.
[00:16:50.734 --> 00:16:56.857]  Prolonged use of mobile phones can lead to permanent damage, including cataracts, scientists believe.
[00:16:57.838 --> 00:17:02.300]  And if it fries your eyeball, imagine what that microwave does to your brain.
[00:17:03.721 --> 00:17:13.766]  Medical researchers have found that microwave radiation of the type emitted by mobile phones caused eye tissue to bubble, a precursor to the formation of cataracts.
[00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:15.847]  It can also interfere with the ability to
[00:17:19.952 --> 00:17:28.735]  Professor Levi Shatler, who led the Israeli team which conducted the study, warned our results show that microwaves can cause irreparable damage.
[00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:31.096]  No kidding, Sherlock!
[00:17:35.297 --> 00:17:36.077]  Here's another one.
[00:17:36.197 --> 00:17:39.858]  Fears over health risk to children of mercury and tuna.
[00:17:41.879 --> 00:17:47.861]  Again, the studies show, this is the Times of London, the studies show that mercury is bad in areas fished with heavy mercury.
[00:17:48.747 --> 00:17:53.089]  It is bad in those levels, but it's also bound organically so it's passed.
[00:17:53.129 --> 00:17:54.870]  The body's designed to pass most of it.
[00:17:55.290 --> 00:18:04.355]  What's deadly is it's injected into the blood at hundreds of times safe level, and it doesn't go through the screens and goes directly to the brain tissue.
[00:18:05.175 --> 00:18:06.676]  Let's not worry about that.
[00:18:07.697 --> 00:18:12.139]  The government is to conduct new research into the levels of mercury in fish.
[00:18:12.579 --> 00:18:16.301]  And it claims that children who eat too much tuna may develop learning difficulties.
[00:18:17.128 --> 00:18:25.773]  A new major study by the Food Standards Agency warned pregnant women two years ago to limit their consumption of tuna to two cans a week to protect the unborn children.
[00:18:26.793 --> 00:18:27.573]  But wait a minute!
[00:18:27.613 --> 00:18:31.415]  The federal studies says mercury's good for the children.
[00:18:33.076 --> 00:18:35.017]  So don't believe all the other studies.
[00:18:35.477 --> 00:18:37.198]  Mercury is good.
[00:18:38.299 --> 00:18:43.121]  Microwave in your brain is good.
[00:18:44.422 --> 00:18:45.002]  Good.
[00:18:47.651 --> 00:18:48.471]  Here's another one.
[00:18:48.531 --> 00:18:50.152]  Bone cancer fluoride link.
[00:18:50.252 --> 00:19:08.698]  Every single union chief of the Environmental Protection Agency and a score of other agencies have written open letters and filed complaints with the FDA saying all of their internal studies show it's causing bone cancer and many other problems and that it's deadly poison!
[00:19:09.859 --> 00:19:11.139]  Don't listen to them!
[00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:15.581]  Don't listen to them!
[00:19:17.529 --> 00:19:19.291]  I have a stack of these articles.
[00:19:20.532 --> 00:19:21.512]  Don't listen to me!
[00:19:21.532 --> 00:19:26.076]  Don't listen to us.
[00:19:27.317 --> 00:19:28.518]  Iraq's a good war.
[00:19:28.799 --> 00:19:30.080]  George Bush is a Christian.
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.581]  Bill Clinton's good.
[00:19:32.342 --> 00:19:33.663]  Global government's good.
[00:19:33.983 --> 00:19:37.426]  NAFTA, GADEN, JAFTA, and FTAA are good.
[00:19:38.047 --> 00:19:39.208]  New freedom is good.
[00:19:39.288 --> 00:19:40.629]  Forced drugging is good.
[00:19:40.969 --> 00:19:43.051]  So what of the molecules of these drugs?
[00:19:44.688 --> 00:19:46.550]  Totally destroyed that brain.
[00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:47.511]  That's good.
[00:19:47.531 --> 00:19:51.314]  Depends on how you look at it, see?
[00:19:52.915 --> 00:19:55.878]  So, the elite don't use cell phones and don't take Prozac.
[00:19:56.198 --> 00:19:57.059]  They're the elite!
[00:19:57.539 --> 00:19:59.061]  Take your poison, cattle!
[00:20:02.165 --> 00:20:05.207]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[00:20:05.448 --> 00:20:11.092]  Already a number one beverage in Asia, Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[00:20:11.392 --> 00:20:17.256]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient, reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[00:20:17.376 --> 00:20:23.361]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs, known for its high nutritional value, reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[00:20:23.541 --> 00:20:24.182]  We're good to go.
[00:20:43.499 --> 00:20:48.262]  And to meet the demands of a busy day the natural and healthy way, try Gano Café today.

[00:21:01.661 --> 00:21:06.945]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[00:21:07.165 --> 00:21:09.227]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[00:21:09.467 --> 00:21:16.593]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[00:21:16.733 --> 00:21:28.242]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[00:21:28.562 --> 00:21:29.363]  We're good to go.
[00:21:58.442 --> 00:21:59.384]  Here it is, folks.
[00:21:59.464 --> 00:22:00.386]  The 2006 Red Book.
[00:22:00.426 --> 00:22:03.513]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[00:22:08.644 --> 00:22:12.287]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.
[00:22:13.068 --> 00:22:14.529]  It includes the history of U.S.
[00:22:14.609 --> 00:22:18.713]  coins, the actual mintages, the grading standards.
[00:22:19.333 --> 00:22:20.974]  Learn the stability of real money.
[00:22:21.415 --> 00:22:23.457]  Protect yourself from fiat currencies.
[00:22:23.857 --> 00:22:25.458]  They are instruments of death.
[00:22:25.638 --> 00:22:27.720]  Feel the comfort and safety of real money.
[00:22:28.261 --> 00:22:33.725]  Midas will send you the 2006 Red Book and a genuine silver dollar for just $22.95 delivered.

[00:22:37.804 --> 00:22:38.144]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:38.224 --> 00:22:40.465]  Don't be lost in a sea of confusion.
[00:22:40.485 --> 00:22:41.165]  Get the 2006 Red Book.
[00:22:41.765 --> 00:22:43.986]  Help steer your own financial ship.

[00:23:04.206 --> 00:23:04.706]  We're good to go.
[00:23:29.705 --> 00:23:31.606]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:23:50.111 --> 00:23:50.171]  866-885-6625.
[00:23:50.191 --> 00:23:50.231]  866-885-6625.
[00:23:50.251 --> 00:23:51.332]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:23:51.512 --> 00:23:53.654]  I got a star on my car and one on my hip.
[00:23:53.834 --> 00:23:55.215]  I mean, look at this red line.
[00:23:55.335 --> 00:23:56.977]  EPA unions call for nutritional...
[00:24:17.603 --> 00:24:20.305]  National fluoridated water moratorium.
[00:24:21.025 --> 00:24:25.788]  Again, EPA unions call for national fluoridated water moratorium.
[00:24:26.288 --> 00:24:29.290]  I have no idea why I turned national into nutritional.
[00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:33.652]  I guess because I was thinking about the TV newscast on Mercury's Nutritional.
[00:24:34.613 --> 00:24:37.975]  EPA unions call for national fluoridated water moratorium.
[00:24:38.355 --> 00:24:39.175]  Coalition of U.S.
[00:24:39.215 --> 00:24:44.538]  Environmental Protection Agency unions is saying get it out of the water.
[00:24:44.578 --> 00:24:45.539]  It's deadly poison.
[00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:49.447]  And then look at these headlines.
[00:24:49.527 --> 00:24:50.488]  Just the craziness.
[00:24:50.668 --> 00:24:53.169]  Dallas law cracks down on feeding the homeless.
[00:24:54.330 --> 00:24:57.913]  And in places like Miami, they arrest you if you try to feed the homeless.
[00:24:58.493 --> 00:24:59.614]  Tampa, they arrest you.
[00:24:59.694 --> 00:25:00.174]  All over.
[00:25:01.235 --> 00:25:02.716]  Don't give the homeless anything.
[00:25:02.756 --> 00:25:04.217]  And sure, a lot of them are drug addicts.
[00:25:04.257 --> 00:25:05.118]  A lot of them are drunks.
[00:25:05.718 --> 00:25:06.899]  But some of them aren't, folks.
[00:25:06.999 --> 00:25:07.679]  And you know what?
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:09.941]  If they don't have rights, we don't have rights.
[00:25:09.981 --> 00:25:17.146]  And they're very proud here on the Dallas Morning News to talk about how they bulldoze the little shanty towns under the highways where these people live.
[00:25:18.379 --> 00:25:19.539]  Where are they supposed to live?
[00:25:21.020 --> 00:25:25.500]  I mean, even in ancient Rome, they didn't bulldoze where the poor, you know, the poor shantytowns.
[00:25:26.201 --> 00:25:29.821]  They don't do that in Mexico City where half the population lives like that.
[00:25:30.121 --> 00:25:31.722]  But they do here in America.
[00:25:33.862 --> 00:25:37.543]  Always chasing them at the borders wide open.
[00:25:37.563 --> 00:25:40.703]  A lot of people just give up.
[00:25:40.743 --> 00:25:43.344]  And by the way, I'm seeing young military people.
[00:25:43.797 --> 00:25:44.558]  They're homeless now.
[00:25:44.618 --> 00:25:49.102]  I'm seeing a lot of pretty clean-cut looking folks that are homeless and look just incredibly depressed.
[00:25:49.563 --> 00:25:57.110]  Even when they don't know that I'm looking at them, I'll pull out a pair of binoculars and look at them in a red light for 60 seconds when they're up there underneath an overpass.
[00:25:58.772 --> 00:26:07.340]  Of course, a lot of them that get their arms and legs blown off, they just go get a job at Home Depot or whatever.
[00:26:10.106 --> 00:26:12.508]  But Dallas law cracks down on feeding the homeless.
[00:26:12.548 --> 00:26:14.190]  And here's the one I mentioned earlier.
[00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:32.545]  Baby yanked from couple for kisses on belly button, and the father was in jail six months awaiting trial until all the experts and others came forward and said he's... And it says in the photo, all the father is doing is clearly kissing the baby on the stomach.
[00:26:33.967 --> 00:26:37.690]  And folks, you take a picture, kissing your son or daughter on the stomach,
[00:26:38.502 --> 00:26:46.825]  And you take it to Eckerd or you take it to Walgreens, a lot of these mentally ill people that want to be little Nazis are going to call the cops.
[00:26:48.266 --> 00:26:49.086]  They've got a system.
[00:26:49.106 --> 00:26:50.106]  They get federal bounties.
[00:26:50.126 --> 00:26:52.527]  The more families they break up, the more kids they steal.
[00:26:53.088 --> 00:26:57.029]  And every two weeks or so, I see an article, and it's usually Eckerd's for some reason.
[00:26:58.010 --> 00:26:59.890]  It's happened at Walmart, too, and other places.
[00:27:01.751 --> 00:27:03.272]  Just kids in the bathtub, folks.
[00:27:03.292 --> 00:27:06.953]  We're talking your two-year-old, your 16-month-old in the bathtub.
[00:27:08.828 --> 00:27:15.072]  Now again, what cop out there, what cop driving along right now doesn't have a shoebox when he goes home to see mama?
[00:27:15.912 --> 00:27:31.821]  You go home to see your parents and they pull out the shoebox or there's the annual up on the shelf and you open it up and there's you and your brother or your sister out in the red wagon or maybe even in the backyard when you're 15 months old running around naked in the sprinklers.
[00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:35.403]  Well, I see articles now where neighbors see that and call the cops.
[00:27:35.923 --> 00:27:37.684]  See, normal human behavior
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.843]  What our species does is evil.
[00:27:43.304 --> 00:27:52.832]  But then you've got 3,000 missing children in Florida and top pedophiles, top child rapists, running the Department of Health and Human Services in Florida, running the computer.
[00:27:52.872 --> 00:27:53.973]  That's mainstream news, by the way.
[00:27:54.274 --> 00:27:56.055]  And it comes out they are, and nobody gets fired.
[00:27:56.576 --> 00:27:58.818]  Missing kids, they find a way to get their heads cut off.
[00:27:59.538 --> 00:28:00.539]  Nobody gets in trouble.
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.121]  Snuff film bonanza.
[00:28:03.822 --> 00:28:04.683]  That's okay.
[00:28:05.962 --> 00:28:06.803]  That's all right.
[00:28:07.043 --> 00:28:09.485]  Dying Corps kidnaps 200,000 women and children.
[00:28:10.025 --> 00:28:11.787]  I mean, I have the Senate reports.
[00:28:11.847 --> 00:28:12.968]  I have the congressional reports.
[00:28:13.388 --> 00:28:14.829]  It's admitted they didn't get him in trouble.
[00:28:15.710 --> 00:28:17.231]  We could play that congressional testimony.
[00:28:17.711 --> 00:28:20.314]  Maybe we can find that Cynthia McKinney where she brings it up to run.
[00:28:20.534 --> 00:28:21.895]  Maybe I should play that coming up later.
[00:28:21.915 --> 00:28:22.515]  You don't believe me.
[00:28:23.436 --> 00:28:25.718]  Yeah, kidnap 200,000 women and children.
[00:28:26.158 --> 00:28:26.959]  That's all right.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:34.445]  But you take a photo of your small children running around naked in the backyard like every one of us did.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.780]  Going back hundreds of years.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:37.521]  Thousands of years.
[00:28:37.581 --> 00:28:38.281]  That's what humans do.
[00:28:39.101 --> 00:28:41.582]  You take a picture of that, you're going to jail.
[00:28:42.923 --> 00:28:44.163]  That's the new America.
[00:28:44.843 --> 00:28:46.364]  That's the sicko America.
[00:28:47.684 --> 00:28:49.005]  I got more of these articles here.
[00:28:49.045 --> 00:28:49.745]  Again, last week.
[00:28:49.765 --> 00:28:51.066]  11-year-old girl.
[00:28:52.046 --> 00:28:52.646]  A student.
[00:28:53.307 --> 00:28:54.027]  Throws a rock.
[00:28:54.047 --> 00:28:56.308]  They're throwing rocks in a fun fight.
[00:28:56.368 --> 00:28:57.488]  We all had those, didn't we?
[00:28:58.048 --> 00:28:58.588]  Playing around.
[00:28:58.608 --> 00:28:59.689]  A little pebble hits a girl.
[00:28:59.729 --> 00:29:00.569]  Causes a lesion.
[00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:01.850]  Small cut on her eye.
[00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:02.630]  She didn't lose her sight.
[00:29:04.025 --> 00:29:05.826]  And they had helicopter SWAT teams come.
[00:29:05.846 --> 00:29:06.386]  She went home.
[00:29:06.846 --> 00:29:08.607]  Helicopter SWAT teams came in.
[00:29:08.647 --> 00:29:10.308]  Helicopters took her out.
[00:29:11.028 --> 00:29:11.688]  Jumped on her.
[00:29:11.748 --> 00:29:14.129]  Big old 200-pound cop on her back.
[00:29:14.169 --> 00:29:15.350]  Photos all over TV.
[00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:17.310]  She didn't resist.
[00:29:17.351 --> 00:29:17.631]  Nobody.
[00:29:17.651 --> 00:29:18.171]  She just came.
[00:29:18.191 --> 00:29:19.031]  They jumped on her.
[00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:20.272]  Took her to jail.
[00:29:20.332 --> 00:29:21.772]  And she's going to be going to prison.
[00:29:22.493 --> 00:29:25.434]  Charged as an adult with assault with a deadly weapon.
[00:29:26.914 --> 00:29:28.335]  Every one of you threw rocks.
[00:29:28.415 --> 00:29:29.976]  Every one of you threw mud balls.
[00:29:30.536 --> 00:29:33.037]  Every one of you ran around in your underwear in the back yard.
[00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:34.471]  Every one of you.
[00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:36.913]  Your mommy, your daddy took a picture of you in the bath.
[00:29:38.755 --> 00:29:41.698]  Well, in this new system, you're all going to prison!
[00:29:42.959 --> 00:29:44.120]  It's the new America!
[00:29:46.022 --> 00:29:47.924]  Hope you enjoy it, slaves!
[00:29:51.927 --> 00:29:52.848]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.309 --> 00:29:54.950]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.010 --> 00:29:58.514]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.716 --> 00:30:04.278]  Americans are under a covert medical attack daily.
[00:30:04.318 --> 00:30:07.900]  These chemicals are affecting our brains and may well destroy our society.
[00:30:08.020 --> 00:30:08.400]  Shocking?
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:08.940]  Of course!
[00:30:09.220 --> 00:30:11.282]  But what you don't know can indeed kill you.
[00:30:11.442 --> 00:30:14.344]  Big business buries the truth and silences the majority.
[00:30:14.544 --> 00:30:15.904]  Forewarned is forearmed.

[00:33:13.075 --> 00:33:17.856]  In your guts, you know the things we cover on this broadcast are true.
[00:33:18.236 --> 00:33:31.739]  In your heart, in the depths of your soul, you know that we have a criminally insane elite engaging in abominable crimes all around us.
[00:33:33.059 --> 00:33:36.000]  It's time for you to consciously face the horror.
[00:33:37.563 --> 00:33:42.344]  That the elite see us as a bunch of cattle and are doing horrible, horrible things to us.
[00:33:42.964 --> 00:33:47.526]  I have a News 8 piece here from the Associated Press.
[00:33:48.186 --> 00:33:50.766]  Dead soldier's mother wants presidential answers.
[00:33:50.786 --> 00:33:57.588]  A California woman whose son died in Iraq last year said her shock has turned into anger.
[00:33:58.609 --> 00:34:00.229]  Cindy Sheehan, who we have on hold...
[00:34:01.019 --> 00:34:07.683]  She said she wants American troops to come home, and she's holding a vigil near President Bush's Texas ranch to press the point.
[00:34:08.124 --> 00:34:11.126]  She and met with Bush shortly after her son died.
[00:34:11.146 --> 00:34:16.269]  Now she wants another meeting, but this time she wants answers, not condolences.
[00:34:17.550 --> 00:34:23.594]  She and said Bush claims that Iraq's Saddam Hussein and weapons of mass destruction had proven to be groundless.
[00:34:23.654 --> 00:34:28.477]  She said her son died for nothing, and every reason Bush gave for going to war was wrong.
[00:34:29.142 --> 00:34:33.385]  She alleges Secret Service agents in Crawford are trying to coerce her into leaving.
[00:34:33.925 --> 00:34:43.491]  She and said agents have told her and fellow protesters that if they stay along the road about five miles from Bush's ranch, they might be hit by Secret Service vehicles.
[00:34:43.971 --> 00:34:47.473]  The Secret Service in Washington said it's unaware of any such incidents.
[00:34:48.093 --> 00:34:54.377]  And I've dealt with the Secret Service at different protests and stuff for Clinton and when Bush was governor running for president.
[00:34:55.029 --> 00:35:03.411]  And the Secret Service that he did have around his governor's mansion when I was out there covering protests were out of control.
[00:35:03.491 --> 00:35:07.571]  They did try to harass us away from even covering the protest.
[00:35:08.291 --> 00:35:17.553]  They would push on us and get in our face and seemed criminal, seemed very, you know, that criminal flavor, that gang member type aura.
[00:35:19.133 --> 00:35:20.734]  Well, they're used to exercising the power.
[00:35:20.754 --> 00:35:21.994]  They rationalize it.
[00:35:22.014 --> 00:35:22.534]  They enjoy it.
[00:35:23.362 --> 00:35:24.722]  I'm not saying all of them are like that.
[00:35:24.762 --> 00:35:29.144]  Most of them are investigating bank robberies and people counterfeiting.
[00:35:30.664 --> 00:35:34.445]  Protesting soldier mom changed story on Bush.
[00:35:34.506 --> 00:35:35.726]  Now Drudge is attacking her.
[00:35:36.226 --> 00:35:36.666]  How dare?
[00:35:37.166 --> 00:35:38.647]  Of course, she's not changing her story.
[00:35:38.727 --> 00:35:42.328]  She just, over time, has gotten more and more angry, like everybody has.
[00:35:42.348 --> 00:35:44.789]  But see, this is the twisting.
[00:35:45.369 --> 00:35:47.490]  It isn't Bush who lied and changed his story.
[00:35:48.010 --> 00:35:48.930]  It's the evil Ms.
[00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.710]  Sheehan.
[00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:51.771]  She's out there in Crawford right now
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:36:07.607]  But just to remind people of the crimes that have been committed, here's a two-minute clip because I was just talking about, I was just reading this article where, you know, the father, the wife takes a picture of the father kissing the baby on the stomach.
[00:36:09.348 --> 00:36:11.949]  I guess all of us that have children are guilty of that.
[00:36:13.770 --> 00:36:16.391]  You know, they love it when you do a raspberry on their stomach.
[00:36:16.611 --> 00:36:17.452]  They laugh and giggle.
[00:36:18.132 --> 00:36:21.353]  And they just said that that's evil and arrested him.
[00:36:21.373 --> 00:36:22.494]  He spent six months in jail.
[00:36:23.710 --> 00:36:27.834]  But I thought we'd play Cynthia McKinney, in case people don't believe me, because this is all admitted.
[00:36:27.934 --> 00:36:33.899]  This has been the BBC, AP, you name it, about DynCorp kidnapping 200,000 women and children and never getting in trouble.
[00:36:34.219 --> 00:36:35.901]  Rumsfeld talks about the penalty box.
[00:36:36.161 --> 00:36:40.304]  We'll just play the two minutes of questions and later play Rumsfeld's answer, because I want to go to Ms.
[00:36:40.344 --> 00:36:42.606]  Sheehan, who's out there in Crawford right now.
[00:36:42.646 --> 00:36:43.767]  But go ahead and roll that.
[00:36:45.208 --> 00:36:46.489]  Oh, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[00:36:48.351 --> 00:36:51.694]  Mr. Secretary, I watched President Bush...
[00:36:52.583 --> 00:37:01.346]  Deliver a moving speech at the United Nations in September 2003, in which he mentioned the crisis of the sex trade.
[00:37:02.247 --> 00:37:06.368]  The President called for the punishment of those involved in this horrible business.
[00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:15.412]  But at the very moment of that speech, DynCorp was exposed for having been involved in the buying and selling of young women and children.
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:29.031]  While all of this was going on, DynCorp kept the Pentagon contract to administer the smallpox-nanthrax vaccines and is now working on a plague vaccine through the Joint Vaccine Acquisition Program.
[00:37:30.352 --> 00:37:32.514]  Mr. Secretary, is it policy of the U.S.
[00:37:32.574 --> 00:37:36.037]  government to reward companies that traffic in women and little girls?
[00:37:36.757 --> 00:37:37.878]  That's my first question.
[00:37:37.918 --> 00:37:43.003]  My second question, Mr. Secretary, according to the Comptroller General of the United States,
[00:37:43.627 --> 00:37:49.212]  There are serious financial management problems at the Pentagon, to which Mr. Cooper alluded.
[00:37:49.932 --> 00:37:53.235]  Fiscal year 1999, $2.3 trillion missing.
[00:37:53.836 --> 00:37:56.978]  Fiscal year 2000, $1.1 trillion missing.
[00:37:57.839 --> 00:38:02.543]  And DOD is the number one reason why the government can't balance its checkbook.
[00:38:03.484 --> 00:38:10.790]  The Pentagon has claimed year after year that the reason it can't account for the money is because its computers don't communicate with each other.
[00:38:11.525 --> 00:38:18.908]  My second question, Mr. Secretary, is who has the contracts today to make those systems communicate with each other?
[00:38:18.928 --> 00:38:21.969]  How long have they had those contracts?
[00:38:22.569 --> 00:38:24.990]  And how much have the taxpayers paid for them?
[00:38:25.834 --> 00:38:35.919]  Finally, Mr. Secretary, after the last hearing, I thought that my office was promised a written response to my question regarding the four war games on September 11th.
[00:38:36.599 --> 00:38:49.066]  I have not yet received that response, but would like for you to respond to the questions that I've put to you today, and then I do expect the written response to my previous question, hopefully by the end of the week.
[00:38:51.947 --> 00:38:55.009]  Thank you, Representative.
[00:38:55.049 --> 00:38:55.289]  First,
[00:38:55.771 --> 00:38:59.352]  The answer to your first question is no, absolutely not.
[00:38:59.492 --> 00:39:09.494]  The policy of the United States government is clear, unambiguous, and opposed to the activities that you described.
[00:39:10.314 --> 00:39:13.555]  The second question.
[00:39:14.135 --> 00:39:23.117]  Well, how do you explain the fact that Dyncor and its successor companies have received and continue to receive government contracts?
[00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:39.600]  I would have to go and find the facts but there are laws and rules and regulations with respect to government contracts and there are times that corporations do things they should not do in which case they tend to be suspended for some period.
[00:39:40.061 --> 00:39:50.508]  There are times then that under the laws and the rules and regulations passed by the Congress and implemented by the executive branch that corporations can get off of
[00:39:51.845 --> 00:39:54.988]  Out of the penalty box, if you will, and be permitted.
[00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:57.490]  And as he says, they were never in the penalty box.
[00:39:57.530 --> 00:39:58.491]  So that's their answer.
[00:39:58.852 --> 00:40:00.373]  And this has been all over the foreign press.
[00:40:01.033 --> 00:40:03.916]  Imagine making a horror movie, a science fiction horror movie.
[00:40:04.684 --> 00:40:21.189]  You know, they've got that movie out right now, The Island, about where they have these clones, they don't even know they're clones, they raise them to think that there's been this terrorist attack, and they're in this contamination-free area, and they get to go to the island when they're good, but the island is really being harvested for their organs.
[00:40:21.209 --> 00:40:23.050]  You know, that's scary.
[00:40:23.530 --> 00:40:26.191]  But imagine in the real world making a science fiction movie.
[00:40:26.914 --> 00:40:39.285]  But making it non-fiction, where, oh, and we kidnap 200,000 women and children in one year, and we fly them, and it's showing the slave brothels, the big hotels, and with the fences around them in Malaysia and Saudi Arabia and Israel.
[00:40:39.505 --> 00:40:40.446]  Oh, these are in Israel.
[00:40:40.966 --> 00:40:41.867]  You just can't get into them.
[00:40:41.927 --> 00:40:43.749]  Big high-rise buildings with all the slaves in them.
[00:40:44.169 --> 00:40:44.890]  Oh, you didn't know that.
[00:40:46.131 --> 00:40:47.852]  Oh, yeah, you just go into slaves.
[00:40:47.952 --> 00:40:48.953]  Oh, there they are, right there.
[00:40:50.314 --> 00:40:52.036]  Billions of them, just all over the planet.
[00:40:52.785 --> 00:40:55.266]  And then these, right here in Austin, Dinecourse changed its name.
[00:40:55.286 --> 00:40:56.446]  It's got a big building downtown.
[00:40:56.486 --> 00:40:58.126]  I mean, I'm down the road from these scary people.
[00:40:58.747 --> 00:41:01.987]  And they want a police state here in America so they can do all that here.
[00:41:02.708 --> 00:41:03.748]  They already are doing that here.
[00:41:04.968 --> 00:41:08.049]  And then if you get caught kissing your baby on the belly button, you're going to go to prison.
[00:41:08.289 --> 00:41:10.970]  But they're going to kidnap children and nothing's going to happen.
[00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:13.290]  Okay, I'm sorry to keep our guests holding for the last seven minutes.
[00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.931]  This is Cindy Sheehan.
[00:41:16.271 --> 00:41:18.952]  And she's out there at Crawford protesting Bush.
[00:41:19.212 --> 00:41:20.272]  Cindy, thank you for coming on.
[00:41:21.331 --> 00:41:22.132]  Hi, thank you.
[00:41:22.152 --> 00:41:23.714]  What did you think of that clip?
[00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:26.677]  That was pretty incredible.
[00:41:26.737 --> 00:41:28.039]  It doesn't surprise me, though.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:32.425]  One thing I want to correct, the Secret Service never threatened to run us over.
[00:41:33.089 --> 00:41:43.954]  Personally, but after they warned us about ten times that we were going to get run over, one of my people who were staying there said, so does that mean if we stay here tonight that you're going to run us over?
[00:41:44.494 --> 00:41:46.555]  And he said, that's not what I'm saying, ma'am.
[00:41:46.575 --> 00:41:49.757]  Okay, well, I just read the Associated Press.
[00:41:50.137 --> 00:41:50.737]  Right, right.
[00:41:50.837 --> 00:41:53.238]  You might call them then and have them correct that.
[00:41:53.798 --> 00:41:54.579]  Yeah, I will.
[00:41:54.739 --> 00:41:57.320]  I didn't, you know, obviously I haven't been able to read anything.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:57.960]  No, no, I understand.
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.101]  You're out in the middle of nowhere.
[00:41:59.121 --> 00:41:59.201]  Yeah.
[00:42:00.379 --> 00:42:03.742]  I'm out camping in Crawford, so I haven't seen any of the press.
[00:42:03.782 --> 00:42:04.843]  I haven't read anything.
[00:42:05.283 --> 00:42:07.385]  But there's some wild things going around.
[00:42:07.646 --> 00:42:18.175]  And one thing I just found out before I called you is that we've been warned by a Texas state representative that if we're still there on Thursday that we're going to be arrested.
[00:42:18.215 --> 00:42:24.421]  Because by Thursday, if we've been there, we'll be a threat to the president.
[00:42:27.006 --> 00:42:30.469]  Well, let them go ahead and arrest... Oh, who was the state rep that told you you'll be arrested?
[00:42:30.509 --> 00:42:31.029]  That's freedom.
[00:42:31.990 --> 00:42:36.253]  Yeah, I don't know... That's what we're fighting for, so we can't stand on the... But you know what?
[00:42:36.573 --> 00:42:37.414]  I'll stay there.
[00:42:37.454 --> 00:42:38.375]  They can arrest me.
[00:42:38.395 --> 00:42:46.981]  I think that'll look really bad on them, but coincidentally, on Thursday, Condoleezza Rice and Donald Rumsfeld are coming out to have a policy meeting.
[00:42:47.001 --> 00:42:48.683]  Yeah, and they don't want the press to see that.
[00:42:48.943 --> 00:42:55.568]  Now, we know all over the country they call up coffee shop owners in Memphis and say, don't have a sign-up against Bush.
[00:42:56.418 --> 00:43:06.885]  We know that they have free speech zones and don't allow you to protest, so are they trying to claim that you're not allowed to... Now, again, folks, there's nothing out there but trees and rolling hills.
[00:43:07.446 --> 00:43:07.666]  Right.
[00:43:08.066 --> 00:43:18.153]  I mean, I've been out in Crawford many times, and you're just five miles down the road, standing on the road with a sign, and this is evil Al-Qaeda activity, I guess.
[00:43:19.255 --> 00:43:28.477]  Well, yeah, what they're saying is that they're not going to make it a freedom of speech issue or a freedom to assemble issue.
[00:43:28.817 --> 00:43:32.238]  They're going to make it a security issue by Thursday.
[00:43:32.398 --> 00:43:33.098]  Well, see, that's what they do.
[00:43:33.158 --> 00:43:42.741]  They say you can have 500 pro-Bush people on a street corner in an unpermanent march, but then one person shows up with a no blood for oil, they selectively arrest you.
[00:43:42.961 --> 00:43:44.581]  Well, that is a free speech issue.
[00:43:45.262 --> 00:43:53.886]  Well, you know, and we are a threat to the president, not a physical threat, but, you know, every day we stay out there, we're damaging him.
[00:43:54.086 --> 00:43:55.626]  You know, I'm calling him a coward.
[00:43:55.666 --> 00:44:02.229]  I'm saying if you really care about me, why don't you muscle up some courage and come out and speak with me?
[00:44:02.409 --> 00:44:07.491]  So you're writing, I mean, what's happening is they don't allow protesters on his parade routes now, and it's the same thing.
[00:44:07.892 --> 00:44:09.132]  You're writing on the parade.
[00:44:09.172 --> 00:44:13.654]  You're getting in the news instead of him out there with his fake cowboy hat stumbling around.
[00:44:14.349 --> 00:44:23.354]  Right, and like you said earlier, now they're trying to put this smoke screen about me changing my mind since June of 2004.
[00:44:23.834 --> 00:44:33.820]  So what they're doing is the media and the White House is trying to say, you know, you can hold this grieving mother up to scrutiny, but we're not going to hold the president and his wives up to scrutiny.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:36.021]  Well, Cindy, I want to go through this one step at a time.
[00:44:36.281 --> 00:44:37.342]  Who is the state rep?
[00:44:37.722 --> 00:44:42.585]  How did you confirm that they indeed are saying you're going to be arrested because of security?
[00:44:44.054 --> 00:44:56.265]  I'm not sure who the state rep is because I'm not in Texas, but my fellow protester is Diane from Code Pink, and she talks to the state rep.
[00:44:56.886 --> 00:44:57.607]  Is she nearby?
[00:44:58.608 --> 00:44:59.809]  She's over at the camp.
[00:44:59.829 --> 00:45:00.710]  She's at the camp.
[00:45:01.952 --> 00:45:03.353]  How far away are you from the camp?
[00:45:03.553 --> 00:45:05.454]  I'm at the Crawford Peace House right now.
[00:45:05.474 --> 00:45:08.155]  I'm probably about five or six miles away from the camp.
[00:45:08.516 --> 00:45:10.817]  Yeah, I've been to the Crawford Peace House too, you know.
[00:45:11.197 --> 00:45:12.718]  Yeah, that's where I am right now.
[00:45:12.798 --> 00:45:17.140]  I've been staying here trying to get my messages caught up and everything.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.161]  Oh, that's good.
[00:45:18.221 --> 00:45:22.483]  Is there any way to get your... So she was told by the state rep...
[00:45:24.384 --> 00:45:24.765]  Yeah.
[00:45:25.085 --> 00:45:26.987]  Is it the local state rep who said this?
[00:45:27.808 --> 00:45:33.453]  It could be, or it could be her state rep, because I believe she's from the Gulf Coast area of Texas.
[00:45:34.834 --> 00:45:36.116]  Well, we'll have to find out about that.
[00:45:36.156 --> 00:45:37.777]  So now you're hearing rumblings of...
[00:45:41.084 --> 00:45:41.344]  Right.
[00:45:41.904 --> 00:45:51.989]  But don't... They say don't evict us yet, because that would be violating our freedom of speech, but by Thursday will be a threat to the president, so that's when we're going to be evicted.
[00:45:52.329 --> 00:46:00.693]  Well, you know, I was just in London last week, and the day after I left, they banned protesting anywhere around the parliament, something people have done for 300 years.
[00:46:01.454 --> 00:46:03.134]  And just peaceful people, they just said nope.
[00:46:03.235 --> 00:46:07.397]  And then the day after I left, we have the video and the photos, they just came in and arrested everybody.
[00:46:07.417 --> 00:46:09.137]  It's freedom.
[00:46:09.818 --> 00:46:10.018]  Yeah.
[00:46:11.132 --> 00:46:30.262]  Well, you know, if George Bush even, if I ever get to talk to him and I ask him what noble cause my son died for, if he even starts to say freedom and democracy, I'm just going to say, baloney, don't even try to tell me that because in America we're less free and the Iraqi people are far less free than they were.
[00:46:31.883 --> 00:46:37.146]  Well, our government is totally criminal and totally illegitimate and is setting up a classical police state right now.
[00:46:38.118 --> 00:46:46.645]  Right, but you can spew filth against the mother of a war hero, but the president can say anything he wants and get away with it.
[00:46:47.105 --> 00:46:49.527]  To me, it is a travesty of justice.
[00:46:49.627 --> 00:46:50.227]  Well, that's right.
[00:46:50.267 --> 00:47:01.436]  You're now being demonized as the bride of Satan by the neocons everywhere, and you're being lied about and twisted and attacked.
[00:47:01.456 --> 00:47:02.297]  What do you want to say to them?
[00:47:02.317 --> 00:47:04.098]  Well, you know what?
[00:47:05.310 --> 00:47:16.015]  I'm glad, because I don't respect them anyway, but what's happening is they're finally, somebody who is finally daring to tell the truth is making him look bad.
[00:47:17.656 --> 00:47:18.856]  And that's what it's all about.
[00:47:18.956 --> 00:47:21.938]  Well, the Emperor's approval rating is down to 32% for the war.
[00:47:23.496 --> 00:47:23.756]  Right.
[00:47:24.456 --> 00:47:31.599]  And most of the people in this country, 61% of the people in this country, believe that the war was a mistake and they want our troops home now.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:34.361]  And by my accident... You haven't seen the latest numbers.
[00:47:34.381 --> 00:47:37.342]  There was a Gallup poll and several other polls yesterday.
[00:47:37.362 --> 00:47:38.502]  He's in the low 30s.
[00:47:39.263 --> 00:47:42.064]  But 61% of America wants our troops home.
[00:47:42.544 --> 00:47:43.104]  More than that.
[00:47:43.704 --> 00:47:44.185]  Oh, good.
[00:47:44.345 --> 00:47:45.025]  And I'm glad.
[00:47:45.165 --> 00:47:50.347]  And what this is doing is giving them something to do, giving them some cause to make their voices heard.
[00:47:50.567 --> 00:47:52.348]  Well, Cindy, I mean, let's just tell them like it is.
[00:47:53.177 --> 00:47:53.397]  Yeah.
[00:47:54.678 --> 00:47:56.498]  Clearly, the British government and the U.S.
[00:47:56.518 --> 00:47:58.679]  government are involved in terror attacks.
[00:47:59.299 --> 00:47:59.960]  Oh, clearly.
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:04.541]  I mean, do you think they'll carry out some type of event here to get everybody behind the war?
[00:48:04.561 --> 00:48:11.244]  Do you think that they'll get the pro-war people out?
[00:48:12.664 --> 00:48:13.485]  Is that what you're saying?
[00:48:14.025 --> 00:48:17.226]  Well, I'm saying, you know, I had George Galloway on, Member of Parliament.
[00:48:17.606 --> 00:48:18.126]  Right, right.
[00:48:18.387 --> 00:48:21.968]  And I said, weeks before the London bombings, I said,
[00:48:22.717 --> 00:48:27.200]  Barring another terror attack, will they be able to invade Iran?
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:34.005]  And I said, isn't there a threat that the government will carry out an event to blame it on Iran?
[00:48:34.326 --> 00:48:36.147]  And he said, yes, that's a real threat.
[00:48:36.167 --> 00:48:37.148]  The government may do that.
[00:48:37.708 --> 00:48:42.291]  Well, and I believe that I don't put anything past our government either.
[00:48:44.053 --> 00:48:45.974]  Well, I mean, they'll let people kidnap 200,000 women and children.
[00:48:49.861 --> 00:48:53.302]  And, you know, I don't know anything about that at all, you know.
[00:48:53.783 --> 00:49:01.906]  All I know is that he has killed almost 200,000 innocent women and children in Iraq by his policies over there.
[00:49:02.206 --> 00:49:11.609]  Well, in the last 14 years, it's... He can lie, he can deceive the American public, and he gets away with everything.
[00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:16.231]  Well, in the last 14 years, it's over a million and a half.
[00:49:16.858 --> 00:49:17.379]  That's right.
[00:49:17.679 --> 00:49:20.802]  You know, and I'm not letting... People always say, you know, well, Bill Clinton.
[00:49:20.862 --> 00:49:22.663]  I said, you know, I'm not letting him off the hook either.
[00:49:23.604 --> 00:49:28.789]  You know, the terrorists hate us because of our Middle East policies, and that's plain and simple.
[00:49:29.229 --> 00:49:35.695]  We change our Middle East policies to make it more fair for everybody, and that's when terrorism's going to stop.
[00:49:35.755 --> 00:49:43.742]  And when we get our kids off out of that... Unless... But, I mean, Cindy, don't you notice the terrorists always attack when Bush is in trouble, and then it kind of seems...
[00:49:44.848 --> 00:49:45.068]  Yeah.
[00:49:45.348 --> 00:49:49.269]  I mean, you know, Saddam says, I'm not with Al Qaeda, and Bin Laden goes, no, no, he is.
[00:49:49.889 --> 00:49:55.031]  I mean, even mainstream reporters have gone, man, it's funny how Al Qaeda seems to always agree with Bush.
[00:49:55.791 --> 00:49:56.091]  Right.
[00:49:57.271 --> 00:49:57.611]  Right.
[00:49:59.012 --> 00:50:01.152]  I don't, you know, I just don't know.
[00:50:01.532 --> 00:50:04.193]  What are you going to do when they march up to you and say, get out of here?
[00:50:04.813 --> 00:50:06.794]  I'm going to say, no, make me.
[00:50:08.594 --> 00:50:10.395]  And I'm ready to go to jail.
[00:50:10.615 --> 00:50:11.275]  You know, Alex?
[00:50:11.952 --> 00:50:13.654]  I don't want to live in a country like this.
[00:50:13.894 --> 00:50:15.236]  And this country is immoral.
[00:50:15.757 --> 00:50:16.798]  The laws are immoral.
[00:50:16.858 --> 00:50:19.120]  The people who enforce the laws are immoral.
[00:50:19.661 --> 00:50:23.726]  And like Henry Davis Rose said, the only place for a moral person to be is in jail.
[00:50:24.366 --> 00:50:25.548]  And I'm ready to go to jail.
[00:50:26.463 --> 00:50:29.766]  And I'm not leaving because it's my right as an American to be there.
[00:50:29.786 --> 00:50:31.968]  Well, you lost your son.
[00:50:31.988 --> 00:50:34.930]  I mean, you've already paid the price.
[00:50:35.250 --> 00:50:35.751]  Not even that.
[00:50:36.151 --> 00:50:39.814]  Not even considering that my son was a U.S.
[00:50:40.094 --> 00:50:42.977]  soldier who was sent to die in a war for no reason.
[00:50:43.457 --> 00:50:47.821]  Besides all that, we're Americans, and we have a right to do what we're doing.
[00:50:48.601 --> 00:50:48.741]  And...
[00:50:50.956 --> 00:50:52.418]  You know, I'm ready to go.
[00:50:52.458 --> 00:50:55.063]  I'm ready to go to jail if they come get me because I'm not moving.
[00:50:55.103 --> 00:50:57.367]  And the only way they're going to get me to leave is... Stay there.
[00:50:57.407 --> 00:50:57.928]  We've got a break.
[00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.990]  Cindy, stay there.
[00:50:59.030 --> 00:51:00.913]  I want to bring up some other important topics with you.
[00:51:02.555 --> 00:51:09.959]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.199 --> 00:51:14.941]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.161 --> 00:51:20.804]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:21.784]  We're good to go.
[00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:40.192]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:51:40.413 --> 00:51:47.158]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:52:37.049 --> 00:52:37.549]  That's right.

[00:53:34.869 --> 00:53:35.189]  I think?
[00:54:08.284 --> 00:54:10.345]  Alright, final segment with Cindy Sheehan.
[00:54:10.386 --> 00:54:11.906]  I know we've got loaded phone lines.
[00:54:12.487 --> 00:54:14.648]  Get to everybody's calls coming up in the next hour.
[00:54:16.289 --> 00:54:19.931]  Cindy, you're going to be out there for the whole month of August.
[00:54:20.011 --> 00:54:23.794]  I want to get weekly updates from you for 10-15 minutes every week.
[00:54:24.694 --> 00:54:26.736]  I may even come up there and interview you on Thursday.
[00:54:26.756 --> 00:54:31.038]  If you can get concrete proof they're planning to arrest you, I'll come out there and get arrested with you.
[00:54:31.739 --> 00:54:33.440]  I mean, this is what it's coming down to, folks.
[00:54:33.540 --> 00:54:36.862]  Middle of nowhere, three miles from God's front gate...
[00:54:37.872 --> 00:54:42.534]  She should be able to be right up against the front gate, but they don't let them get up that close.
[00:54:43.214 --> 00:54:46.195]  Cindy, tell folks about your new website that I was unaware of.
[00:54:46.235 --> 00:54:46.976]  I'm glad to hear about it.
[00:54:47.236 --> 00:54:54.779]  And tell listeners right now, we have a lot of listeners in Texas, a lot of affiliates, how they can come and join you for a day or two.
[00:54:55.779 --> 00:54:59.260]  Okay, let's get to Crawford.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:01.061]  It's really small.
[00:55:01.141 --> 00:55:02.742]  You go down Prairie Chapel Road.
[00:55:03.593 --> 00:55:05.394]  It's only one way in and one way out.
[00:55:05.434 --> 00:55:10.377]  We're about five miles off the main road of Crawford and you won't be able to miss our encampment.
[00:55:10.417 --> 00:55:14.719]  We have banners and tents and cars parked there.
[00:55:15.119 --> 00:55:20.422]  And we would love to have any support we can get, especially Thursday if they're planning on arresting us.
[00:55:20.502 --> 00:55:23.304]  If we have a huge amount of people there, how can they arrest everybody?
[00:55:24.806 --> 00:55:31.392]  How many people... Folks, if you just get to Crawford, it's like 30 miles off I-35, up by Waco Temple.
[00:55:32.173 --> 00:55:36.217]  If you just get to Crawford, it's very easy to find.
[00:55:36.277 --> 00:55:37.898]  I've been right where she's sitting.
[00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:40.956]  It's very easy to find.
[00:55:41.516 --> 00:55:46.539]  And to keep posted on what's going on, they can go to our new website.
[00:55:46.619 --> 00:55:50.220]  It's called meetwithcindy.org.
[00:55:51.141 --> 00:55:54.823]  And everything up-to-date information.
[00:55:55.763 --> 00:56:00.107]  Okay, in 60 seconds, Cindy, tell folks what happened when you met with Bush.
[00:56:00.728 --> 00:56:03.150]  He didn't even know your name.
[00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:04.291]  He said, who are you?
[00:56:04.331 --> 00:56:04.892]  Go ahead.
[00:56:17.347 --> 00:56:20.749]  He walked in and he goes, who are we honored in here?
[00:56:20.769 --> 00:56:31.874]  And we all looked at each other and we were all thinking at the same time as my son's father and my other three children, we were thinking, are you kidding me?
[00:56:31.914 --> 00:56:33.455]  He doesn't even know Casey's name?
[00:56:34.187 --> 00:56:38.450]  You know, and then he... Didn't even have a staffer give him the name on a sheet before he walked in.
[00:56:38.670 --> 00:56:39.771]  No, not at all.
[00:56:39.991 --> 00:56:42.593]  And then he acted like we were at a tea party.
[00:56:42.993 --> 00:56:46.716]  He went up to my daughter and he goes, Who are you to the loved one?
[00:56:47.276 --> 00:56:49.358]  And Carly goes, He was my brother.
[00:56:49.378 --> 00:56:54.561]  And he goes, I wish I could bring your loved one back to fill the hole in your heart.
[00:56:55.042 --> 00:56:57.163]  And Carly goes, Yeah, so do we.
[00:56:57.183 --> 00:56:59.365]  By the way, I believe he is speeding.
[00:56:59.965 --> 00:57:02.587]  Again, are you aware of what Skull and Bones is, Cindy?
[00:57:02.607 --> 00:57:02.647]  No.
[00:57:03.368 --> 00:57:03.668]  Yes.
[00:57:04.168 --> 00:57:06.849]  I believe he's feeding on you because these aren't even photo ops.
[00:57:06.869 --> 00:57:08.549]  These are done behind closed doors.
[00:57:08.629 --> 00:57:10.189]  I wouldn't get anywhere near that monster.
[00:57:10.809 --> 00:57:17.651]  Well, you know what he told Carly after Carly said, yeah, we wish you could bring our loved one back too to fill the hole in our hearts.
[00:57:18.611 --> 00:57:23.212]  He told her, I'm sure you do.
[00:57:23.552 --> 00:57:25.492]  Did it seem like at that point he was enjoying it?
[00:57:25.512 --> 00:57:30.093]  It kind of, you know, what really it seemed like was he wasn't even there.
[00:57:31.195 --> 00:57:33.437]  You know, he was already on to the next thing.
[00:57:33.917 --> 00:57:36.239]  You know, he wasn't fully present with us.
[00:57:36.379 --> 00:57:37.319]  I believe he was feeding.
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.061]  I don't think he can be fully present to anybody.
[00:57:40.081 --> 00:57:45.765]  But, you know, the White House didn't even know I met with him until I told them on Saturday.
[00:57:46.065 --> 00:57:46.406]  All right.
[00:57:46.806 --> 00:57:48.587]  Well, listen, I really want to thank you for coming on.
[00:57:48.607 --> 00:57:49.608]  We'll get updates from you.
[00:57:49.688 --> 00:57:53.070]  And meetwithcindy.org.
[00:57:53.490 --> 00:57:54.971]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[00:57:55.412 --> 00:57:56.272]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:57:56.392 --> 00:57:56.773]  Take care.
[00:57:56.813 --> 00:57:57.053]  Bye-bye.

[00:59:04.084 --> 00:59:05.004]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.645 --> 00:59:09.347]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.827 --> 00:59:13.890]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.367 --> 00:59:26.849]  We're talking about survival of the species here against a criminal elite hereditary gang who sees us as cattle as their slaves.
[00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:45.053]  We are having our psyches, our souls, our IQs, our everything being decimated, being annihilated, being scientifically attacked and pried open like a tin can with a crowbar.
[00:59:46.331 --> 00:59:47.752]  We're being turned into slaves.
[00:59:48.593 --> 00:59:49.494]  It's all around us.
[00:59:49.514 --> 00:59:50.695]  They're totally ruthless.
[00:59:50.775 --> 00:59:52.256]  Our lives mean nothing to them.
[00:59:52.616 --> 00:59:58.642]  They just have to move in a calm, controlled, slick way so we don't resist and buck them.
[00:59:59.242 --> 01:00:06.168]  They've almost got us chained down and then any pretext of lovey-doveness is going to go out the window.
[01:00:07.791 --> 01:00:10.632]  James and Joel and Frank and Mark and everybody, your calls are coming up.
[01:00:10.972 --> 01:00:17.653]  There is so much news on 9-11, on Iraq, on oil prices exploding, on the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:00:18.714 --> 01:00:19.374]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:19.394 --> 01:00:22.294]  But let's just go to calls, because I covered news and had a guest on in the last hour.
[01:00:22.575 --> 01:00:23.975]  Let's just start going to calls right now.
[01:00:24.655 --> 01:00:26.335]  Let's talk to James in New Jersey.
[01:00:26.395 --> 01:00:27.176]  James, go ahead.
[01:00:27.196 --> 01:00:27.956]  Hey, Alex.
[01:00:28.436 --> 01:00:28.556]  Hi.
[01:00:28.576 --> 01:00:33.097]  I was wondering, I'd like to hear your opinion on the history of the Jesuits and the Black Pope.
[01:00:33.735 --> 01:00:36.856]  Like, do the Jesuits control all the secret societies?
[01:00:37.056 --> 01:00:38.016]  No, I don't believe so.
[01:00:38.396 --> 01:00:39.876]  Do you know who the Black Pope is?
[01:00:40.076 --> 01:00:42.217]  Yeah, it's the head of the Jesuits.
[01:00:42.597 --> 01:00:43.477]  Yeah, do you know his name?
[01:00:44.237 --> 01:00:46.898]  Yeah, uh... Is it Peter Hans Kolovich?
[01:00:47.158 --> 01:00:47.418]  Yes.
[01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:49.798]  And he's not the most powerful man in the world?
[01:00:50.479 --> 01:00:51.439]  I don't believe so, no.
[01:00:51.819 --> 01:00:57.500]  Oh, because... I don't know, there's lots of people like William Cooper and Eric John... I was wondering, are you ever going to have Eric John Phelps on?
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.901]  Why don't you... Did he write Vatican Assassins?
[01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:01.361]  Yes.
[01:01:02.219 --> 01:01:03.800]  You know, I keep meaning to have him on.
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.361]  Do you have his contact information?
[01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:07.383]  Probably, it's on his website.
[01:01:08.043 --> 01:01:08.824]  What's his website?
[01:01:09.284 --> 01:01:11.646]  VaticanAssassins.com or .org.
[01:01:14.328 --> 01:01:15.789]  All right, I'll check into it.
[01:01:16.530 --> 01:01:16.790]  All right.
[01:01:17.971 --> 01:01:20.653]  Well, just go into the history of the Jesuits, because I'd like to hear that.
[01:01:21.253 --> 01:01:25.396]  Well, I mean, I'm not the historical master of the world, but it is the Society of Jesus.
[01:01:26.037 --> 01:01:26.137]  Okay.
[01:01:26.157 --> 01:01:28.138]  And it was started in, what, Portugal?
[01:01:28.739 --> 01:01:29.299]  Or Spain?
[01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:30.180]  I think Spain.
[01:01:30.831 --> 01:01:32.092]  I want to say Portugal.
[01:01:32.612 --> 01:01:35.654]  But I think they're way higher up in the pyramid than the Freemasons.
[01:01:35.674 --> 01:01:37.336]  I would just like to hear a lot more on them.
[01:01:37.876 --> 01:01:38.176]  All right.
[01:01:38.216 --> 01:01:39.177]  Well, thank you for the call.
[01:01:40.258 --> 01:01:48.923]  Everybody says it's the Jews, or it's the Masons, or it's the Jesuits, or it's the Templars.
[01:01:49.144 --> 01:01:50.324]  And let me just give you the answer.
[01:01:50.925 --> 01:01:53.887]  It's the heads of all these groups are globalists.
[01:01:54.707 --> 01:01:57.850]  It's like... They're Luciferians, folks.
[01:01:58.010 --> 01:01:58.130]  It's...
[01:01:59.742 --> 01:02:04.547]  It's like Adam Weissach at Ingolstadt University, a professor of canon law.
[01:02:05.608 --> 01:02:11.574]  People go, well, my goodness, you know, he was a Jesuit, so, you know, the Illuminati was founded by a Jesuit.
[01:02:11.614 --> 01:02:19.442]  But I mean, in their internal writings, which the Germans were able to get when a courier was struck by lightning, literally, this is an encyclopedia, folks.
[01:02:20.532 --> 01:02:22.294]  They were undermining the Jesuits.
[01:02:22.314 --> 01:02:23.715]  They were undermining the Catholics.
[01:02:23.735 --> 01:02:25.978]  They were saying, we use these idiots.
[01:02:26.238 --> 01:02:27.860]  We're taking over their organization.
[01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:33.145]  It's kind of like spies within a group using its compartmentalization to take it over.
[01:02:35.232 --> 01:02:37.473]  But, I mean, some people think it's the Russians.
[01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:42.096]  And anybody who doesn't say it's the Russians and the Communists is an evil liar.
[01:02:42.656 --> 01:02:45.138]  And if you don't say it's the Jews, you're an evil liar.
[01:02:45.538 --> 01:02:57.444]  Folks, the heads of the Communists, the heads of the Jews, the heads of the Protestants, the heads of the Catholics, I mean, literally, the New World Order takes over any really big organization they can, by hook or by crook.
[01:02:58.525 --> 01:03:00.246]  And this happens over time.
[01:03:00.866 --> 01:03:03.888]  And things tend to get corrupted over time, especially big organizations.
[01:03:04.577 --> 01:03:10.722]  You know, the whole tone of that caller was kind of like, Alex, you're not giving us the big scoop.
[01:03:11.023 --> 01:03:13.204]  You're not telling us it's the Jesuits.
[01:03:14.626 --> 01:03:19.630]  And I let you say your piece and let you get your website out, and I might get that guy on.
[01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:21.031]  I've thought about getting him on.
[01:03:21.051 --> 01:03:23.473]  There's so many people I want to get on, I forget to get them on.
[01:03:24.914 --> 01:03:30.159]  But I did read Vatican Assassins, and I don't agree with some of it.
[01:03:30.359 --> 01:03:32.781]  I mean, just any time you say it's one group...
[01:03:34.203 --> 01:03:35.484]  You know, one organization.
[01:03:36.564 --> 01:03:38.525]  It just isn't the truth.
[01:03:39.246 --> 01:03:41.066]  Now, are they corrupt and out of control?
[01:03:41.126 --> 01:03:41.467]  Certainly.
[01:03:43.307 --> 01:03:44.348]  But that isn't good enough.
[01:03:44.428 --> 01:03:45.949]  They've got to be at the head of it.
[01:03:48.070 --> 01:03:50.351]  Alex Jones is secretly working.
[01:03:54.617 --> 01:03:55.018]  We're good to go.
[01:03:55.058 --> 01:03:55.778]  We're good to go.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:14.840]  We're good to go.
[01:04:44.378 --> 01:04:47.743]  That's Infowars.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:04:47.823 --> 01:04:51.289]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:04:53.729 --> 01:04:57.210]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:04:57.470 --> 01:05:00.972]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:05:01.052 --> 01:05:05.013]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:05:05.213 --> 01:05:11.395]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:05:11.795 --> 01:05:19.698]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:05:20.118 --> 01:05:20.998]  We're good to go.

[01:05:55.763 --> 01:05:59.605]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:05:59.905 --> 01:06:00.725]  Read the labels.
[01:06:01.165 --> 01:06:05.287]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:06:05.507 --> 01:06:09.709]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:14.951]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:06:15.331 --> 01:06:18.913]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:06:19.093 --> 01:06:24.436]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.

[01:06:40.044 --> 01:06:45.145]  Call Cal-Ben toll-free at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:06:45.165 --> 01:06:49.966]  That's 800-340-7091, or visit calbenpuresoap.com.
[01:06:54.828 --> 01:07:00.849]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.469 --> 01:07:04.450]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.811 --> 01:07:14.153]  Yes, some vital news and info coming up here after we take some calls.
[01:07:15.454 --> 01:07:17.875]  More details on a story I mentioned in the last hour.
[01:07:18.015 --> 01:07:23.179]  EPA unions call for national fluoridated water moratorium.
[01:07:23.699 --> 01:07:26.000]  All the big unions are coming out and saying it's deadly poison.
[01:07:26.341 --> 01:07:27.041]  Please take it out.
[01:07:27.081 --> 01:07:28.262]  The EPA unions.
[01:07:28.402 --> 01:07:29.042]  Scientists.
[01:07:29.543 --> 01:07:31.224]  I mean, hundreds of them signing these letters.
[01:07:33.245 --> 01:07:35.486]  Mobile phones can trigger eye damage.
[01:07:35.746 --> 01:07:36.927]  That's the London Telegraph.
[01:07:37.528 --> 01:07:38.208]  Here's another one.
[01:07:38.288 --> 01:07:39.709]  Fears over mercury.
[01:07:40.296 --> 01:07:41.256]  In the food supply.
[01:07:42.056 --> 01:07:43.817]  Bone cancer fluoride link.
[01:07:43.857 --> 01:07:44.837]  Another report.
[01:07:45.617 --> 01:07:47.918]  Still doing business after all these years.
[01:07:47.978 --> 01:07:49.198]  Halliburton and Iran.
[01:07:49.218 --> 01:08:09.262]  Did you know right up until the day that the bombing started, a few months before the globalists invaded Iraq in 2003, oh yeah, they started bombing them during the ultimatum, Halliburton was the only major oil company Saddam was allowed to do business with for oil production components.
[01:08:10.263 --> 01:08:14.484]  Oil pipeline and drilling rig components.
[01:08:14.984 --> 01:08:16.304]  That was part of the sanctions.
[01:08:16.964 --> 01:08:21.425]  Where you're only allowed to do business with James Baker and Dick Cheney and the Bushes.
[01:08:21.445 --> 01:08:22.085]  I mean, literally.
[01:08:22.125 --> 01:08:22.785]  That's been in the news.
[01:08:22.805 --> 01:08:23.465]  You can read the articles.
[01:08:24.785 --> 01:08:27.026]  Just type in Halliburton doing business with Saddam.
[01:08:28.126 --> 01:08:29.426]  And it's the same thing now.
[01:08:29.866 --> 01:08:31.067]  Still doing business with him.
[01:08:31.367 --> 01:08:32.747]  I mean, it's just crazy, folks.
[01:08:34.387 --> 01:08:38.488]  Wes turns a blind eye as police put Saddam's torturers back to work.
[01:08:38.508 --> 01:08:39.368]  This is out of the Times.
[01:08:40.071 --> 01:08:40.912]  We already knew this.
[01:08:40.972 --> 01:08:42.453]  That's why the Iraqis are so mad.
[01:08:42.933 --> 01:08:48.037]  You know, at first, some of them were going, well, maybe they are here to, you know, do this, to help us.
[01:08:48.478 --> 01:08:51.781]  But then automatically, they put almost all the Bathurst back in control.
[01:08:52.281 --> 01:08:58.746]  And the old torture camps our government helped pay to build in the 80s are back open, and it's just, it's horrible.
[01:08:59.086 --> 01:09:01.088]  So, they're pretty mad about that, you know?
[01:09:02.469 --> 01:09:07.313]  And there's a demand that London cops show their subway video evidence.
[01:09:07.333 --> 01:09:09.555]  They claim they have all this video evidence, but they won't show it
[01:09:10.837 --> 01:09:16.942]  And also, alternative media amplifies as mainstream media gatekeepers decline.
[01:09:17.863 --> 01:09:23.167]  Very interesting article that myself and Paul Watson put together about the power of the alternative media.
[01:09:24.248 --> 01:09:32.955]  Infowars.com, on an average day, is now bigger in traffic than the Austin American Statesman, which is the big paper of Central Texas.
[01:09:32.975 --> 01:09:36.538]  If you go to Alexa.com and you write it,
[01:09:38.466 --> 01:09:46.753]  Both of my sites, by themselves, not even combined, are bigger than things like major newspapers, the Daily Oklahoman, stuff like that.
[01:09:47.573 --> 01:10:03.085]  These are sites getting visits for the editorials, visits for people that have put ads in the paper, the classifieds, people going to look up different restaurants, different movies, singles pages.
[01:10:03.585 --> 01:10:07.028]  All we are is news, and we're bigger than major newspapers.
[01:10:08.143 --> 01:10:09.184]  I'm going to give you an example.
[01:10:09.204 --> 01:10:10.685]  Take something like the American Spectator.
[01:10:11.105 --> 01:10:14.968]  One of my websites is about ten times bigger than the American Spectator's website.
[01:10:15.288 --> 01:10:15.808]  Just one of them.
[01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:17.509]  I'm not tooting our horn.
[01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:31.279]  There are hundreds of sites that are patriot sites or alternative sites, hundreds, that are as big or bigger, sometimes many, many times, hundreds of times bigger than my little sites, Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:33.111 --> 01:10:35.032]  But, I mean, it is daunting, though.
[01:10:35.052 --> 01:10:36.733]  I mean, what a responsibility.
[01:10:37.133 --> 01:10:38.714]  I mean, it actually is humbling.
[01:10:40.095 --> 01:10:41.536]  Last night, I couldn't go to sleep.
[01:10:41.616 --> 01:10:43.617]  I was just thinking, man, I've got to do a better job.
[01:10:43.697 --> 01:10:46.118]  I've got to get my points across to people.
[01:10:46.158 --> 01:10:47.819]  I've got to warn folks.
[01:10:47.939 --> 01:10:52.562]  I mean, I write an article, and millions of people that day read it.
[01:10:53.122 --> 01:10:56.044]  Not to mention all the hundreds of sites that also syndicated.
[01:10:57.585 --> 01:10:57.705]  And...
[01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:00.268]  We're all exploding.
[01:11:00.328 --> 01:11:01.749]  By the way, the trends are like this.
[01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:05.109]  All the Patriot and alternative sites are exploding.
[01:11:05.889 --> 01:11:08.450]  Our graphs go straight up over the last two years.
[01:11:09.170 --> 01:11:10.510]  And it's accelerating.
[01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:13.351]  It's geometric.
[01:11:13.791 --> 01:11:14.631]  It's exponential.
[01:11:15.411 --> 01:11:18.672]  And then they're geometrically or exponentially going down.
[01:11:21.052 --> 01:11:22.932]  So it's the complete inverse.
[01:11:24.353 --> 01:11:26.473]  And that's why they're going to do something real big real soon.
[01:11:27.282 --> 01:11:31.145]  But it's already too late for you.
[01:11:31.165 --> 01:11:33.867]  You're a bunch of murdering scum.
[01:11:33.927 --> 01:11:35.248]  The people have seen the evidence.
[01:11:35.688 --> 01:11:38.090]  We've posted your own documents.
[01:11:38.890 --> 01:11:43.493]  Where Henry Kissinger says sterilize half the women forcibly or no IMF, World Bank money.
[01:11:43.513 --> 01:11:48.176]  They read all the UN documents about putting sterilization hormones in the tetanus shots.
[01:11:48.577 --> 01:11:50.218]  They read your own documents.
[01:11:50.638 --> 01:11:53.200]  They read your own documents on fluoride being a toxic sedative.
[01:11:55.399 --> 01:11:56.981]  Too late!
[01:11:57.581 --> 01:12:00.584]  More and more, too late for you!
[01:12:00.604 --> 01:12:03.326]  Too late!
[01:12:04.407 --> 01:12:05.989]  Because it's too late!
[01:12:06.910 --> 01:12:07.930]  Too late!
[01:12:08.931 --> 01:12:10.573]  Too late for you!
[01:12:10.593 --> 01:12:19.441]  We've got to be a little bit positive about that, but I want to go back and spend a few minutes, and then we'll go to Joel and Frank and Mark and Luke and others that are patiently holding.
[01:12:20.482 --> 01:12:21.463]  But James in...
[01:12:22.725 --> 01:12:23.446]  New York or something.
[01:12:23.466 --> 01:12:24.527]  I forget where he called from.
[01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:25.828]  He called in last segment.
[01:12:25.848 --> 01:12:28.030]  If you didn't hear it, some stations don't carry that five-minute segment.
[01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:30.492]  And he said, Alex, do you know who the Black Pope is?
[01:12:30.532 --> 01:12:31.432]  And then he knew full well.
[01:12:31.893 --> 01:12:32.874]  And then he said, do you know his name?
[01:12:32.894 --> 01:12:33.995]  And I couldn't quite grasp it.
[01:12:34.035 --> 01:12:34.615]  It's a long one.
[01:12:34.635 --> 01:12:35.656]  And then he said it.
[01:12:35.736 --> 01:12:40.060]  And all of this, it was just the attitude of, well, why don't you talk about that?
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:40.740]  Well, why don't you?
[01:12:42.101 --> 01:12:42.922]  I do talk about it.
[01:12:43.623 --> 01:12:47.386]  But, you know, if I just get up here and say, Masons are devil worshippers.
[01:12:47.961 --> 01:12:49.401]  Catholics are evil.
[01:12:50.462 --> 01:12:52.022]  Protestants are all evil.
[01:12:52.682 --> 01:12:54.442]  All Republicans are evil.
[01:12:54.582 --> 01:12:55.923]  All Democrats are evil.
[01:12:57.763 --> 01:13:00.364]  That's how this Balkanized stuff is supposed to work.
[01:13:01.764 --> 01:13:02.124]  Okay?
[01:13:02.524 --> 01:13:08.085]  Most Catholics are good, loving, hardworking, decent, pro-life people.
[01:13:08.225 --> 01:13:08.705]  I've met them.
[01:13:08.805 --> 01:13:09.205]  I know them.
[01:13:09.305 --> 01:13:09.866]  I like them.
[01:13:11.606 --> 01:13:16.507]  Most Protestants are good, Christ-loving, abortion-hating, good, strong people.
[01:13:17.973 --> 01:13:18.313]  Okay?
[01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:30.679]  Most masons are God-loving, socially responsible, want to be involved, want to be in society, want to do good works, want to raise money or burn victims.
[01:13:33.925 --> 01:13:36.367]  But that's the groups you want to control.
[01:13:36.427 --> 01:13:38.128]  That's the people you want to manipulate.
[01:13:38.148 --> 01:13:39.409]  They're a powerful force.
[01:13:39.710 --> 01:13:40.770]  They're your emissaries.
[01:13:40.830 --> 01:13:42.912]  People instinctively know what's true and what's false.
[01:13:43.172 --> 01:13:47.175]  So if you've got somebody who means well working for you, they're the best salesmen in the world.
[01:13:47.496 --> 01:13:53.440]  The globalists are masters at controlling unwitting, useful idiot dupes.
[01:13:55.242 --> 01:13:56.323]  I mean, I've got a great uncle.
[01:13:56.783 --> 01:13:58.484]  He's a mason involved in the community.
[01:13:58.524 --> 01:13:59.185]  Helps people.
[01:13:59.205 --> 01:14:00.206]  He's not bad.
[01:14:01.065 --> 01:14:06.827]  He goes to church every Sunday and goes to Sunday school and cries when he hears a sermon about Jesus.
[01:14:09.148 --> 01:14:16.711]  And it's hard to bring myself to argue with him and for him to tune into this show sometimes to hear all of this.
[01:14:20.433 --> 01:14:21.453]  I mean, it's hard for him.
[01:14:22.894 --> 01:14:25.255]  I mean, he's not a devil worshiper.
[01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:29.590]  But it is true that 33rd Degree and above, man, they worship Lucifer.
[01:14:29.911 --> 01:14:31.012]  Their own books are published.
[01:14:31.072 --> 01:14:35.756]  Albert Pike, they've got pictures of him in all their big lodges.
[01:14:35.796 --> 01:14:37.458]  And you can go, well, here's his book.
[01:14:37.498 --> 01:14:37.838]  He wrote it.
[01:14:37.879 --> 01:14:39.760]  He says, I'll worship Lucifer.
[01:14:40.321 --> 01:14:41.242]  Lucifer's God.
[01:14:41.282 --> 01:14:43.544]  I mean, it's true.
[01:14:45.406 --> 01:14:47.268]  This is how intelligence agencies work.
[01:14:47.288 --> 01:14:50.571]  If I get up here and say the whole FBI is evil, they're all a bunch of mad bombers.
[01:14:51.713 --> 01:15:00.580]  Well, FBI agents hear that, or wives of FBI agents, or cousins of FBI agents hear that, and they go, you know, my cousin, you know, David Johnson, or whatever, that's a random name.
[01:15:00.860 --> 01:15:02.682]  There's a real David Johnson I'm not talking about.
[01:15:03.102 --> 01:15:03.823]  Just a random name.
[01:15:03.843 --> 01:15:06.965]  You know, David Doe.
[01:15:07.525 --> 01:15:08.006]  John Doe.
[01:15:08.795 --> 01:15:09.756]  Well, he's not bad.
[01:15:09.776 --> 01:15:13.058]  I mean, you know, he got shot by bank robbers.
[01:15:13.118 --> 01:15:15.260]  You know, he does a good job.
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:18.802]  Bank robbers were holding somebody hostage, and he went in and took them out.
[01:15:18.822 --> 01:15:28.710]  You know, don't you dare call my... No, it's criminal, compartmentalized, need-to-know basis groups in the FBI that are murdering people, kidnapping kids.
[01:15:29.370 --> 01:15:32.692]  Blowing up buildings, murder for hire, they get caught, they've been caught a bunch.
[01:15:33.052 --> 01:15:34.292]  I mean, we're talking, we're talking.
[01:15:34.573 --> 01:15:40.395]  Look, the smart criminal doesn't go out and, you know, rape and kill and slaughter and get caught.
[01:15:40.435 --> 01:15:43.657]  They go join, go to Quantico, get a badge.
[01:15:43.677 --> 01:15:47.118]  I mean, smart criminals don't get caught very often, folks.
[01:15:47.138 --> 01:15:47.979]  They become the government.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:52.021]  You've got really four different groups of people.
[01:15:52.061 --> 01:15:54.322]  The totally dumbed down, only care about football and beer.
[01:15:55.552 --> 01:16:16.903]  The people that are naive and do care, but are bought into some false paradigm, and the people that do know about the evil, but think that the end justifies the means, and they've got to do this to defeat other evil that's even greater, and then you've got the controllers that are pure evil, and enjoy evil, and are very cold-blooded, or flat-out enjoy it, and systematically know the whole plan and what they're doing.
[01:16:17.343 --> 01:16:21.385]  Then I guess the fifth group, those of us that know what's going on, and are standing up against it and fighting it.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:25.742]  And so, you know, it's really that simple.
[01:16:27.403 --> 01:16:29.284]  And there's more subgroups than all of those groups.
[01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:39.052]  But, I mean, obviously the Catholic Church has been extremely corrupt and extremely godlike and, you know, done all these imperial things.
[01:16:39.112 --> 01:16:40.973]  Power corrupts absolutely, power corrupts absolutely.
[01:16:41.534 --> 01:16:44.016]  There's been all sorts of revolutions and takeovers.
[01:16:44.496 --> 01:16:45.997]  I've been trying to research it lately.
[01:16:46.718 --> 01:16:47.919]  Trying to spend some time on it.
[01:16:47.959 --> 01:16:51.161]  And there have been takeovers and overthrows and different regimes.
[01:16:51.221 --> 01:16:53.043]  And, yeah, it's been pretty bad.
[01:16:54.187 --> 01:16:55.068]  And it's gotten worse.
[01:16:55.128 --> 01:17:01.073]  I mean, Pope John Paul II called for a new world order and one world religion, and he really did do that.
[01:17:01.713 --> 01:17:03.054]  Ratzinger's even worse.
[01:17:03.154 --> 01:17:07.198]  I mean, I've actually read a couple books about Ratzinger, including Hutton Gibson's book.
[01:17:09.039 --> 01:17:09.319]  What is it?
[01:17:09.359 --> 01:17:10.200]  The Enemy is Here.
[01:17:10.941 --> 01:17:12.001]  Talk about scholarly.
[01:17:12.081 --> 01:17:12.362]  Man.
[01:17:13.563 --> 01:17:15.945]  Really hard to turn away from, but it gave me a headache.
[01:17:15.965 --> 01:17:16.965]  There was so much information.
[01:17:17.206 --> 01:17:18.146]  That guy's a scholar.
[01:17:18.346 --> 01:17:20.849]  He won Jeopardy!
[01:17:21.009 --> 01:17:21.889]  National Championship.
[01:17:21.909 --> 01:17:22.590]  He's pretty smart, folks.
[01:17:23.210 --> 01:17:23.371]  But...
[01:17:26.158 --> 01:17:30.960]  But when you sit there and go, the Catholics are the spawn of the devil, and it's the, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:17:31.780 --> 01:17:34.862]  You just turned away all those people that would wake up to the New World Order.
[01:17:35.482 --> 01:17:36.682]  Are there evil people in control?
[01:17:36.903 --> 01:17:37.623]  Absolutely.
[01:17:38.823 --> 01:17:39.904]  Is George Bush evil?
[01:17:39.964 --> 01:17:40.324]  Yes.
[01:17:40.944 --> 01:17:44.686]  Is the Republican Party itself, you know, all the people down at the grassroots evil?
[01:17:44.726 --> 01:17:46.066]  No, most of them are useful idiots.
[01:17:46.627 --> 01:17:52.269]  Meaning, well, when I say the Red Cross is criminal, I don't mean you are, because you give them a blanket or a hundred dollars.
[01:17:53.135 --> 01:17:55.837]  I mean, those running it are mafia criminals.
[01:17:57.639 --> 01:17:58.380]  Who steal.
[01:17:58.460 --> 01:18:00.782]  They've been convicted in court, folks.
[01:18:01.362 --> 01:18:02.203]  All over the world.
[01:18:04.985 --> 01:18:06.587]  Evil is what we're fighting.
[01:18:06.967 --> 01:18:08.488]  Evil is in control.
[01:18:09.129 --> 01:18:10.310]  Evil is in control.
[01:18:10.610 --> 01:18:14.454]  So instead of sitting and saying, this group, that group, and then, well, that person doesn't hate this group.
[01:18:14.474 --> 01:18:15.434]  They only like that group.
[01:18:15.474 --> 01:18:17.236]  And so, I think this person really won't.
[01:18:17.256 --> 01:18:17.796]  Blah, blah, blah.
[01:18:17.856 --> 01:18:20.579]  Instead of that, if you just fight the policies of evil...
[01:18:21.599 --> 01:18:27.003]  It doesn't matter if it's a Catholic or a Jew or a Protestant or an Easter Bunny that's doing it.
[01:18:27.243 --> 01:18:34.548]  And frankly, from my studies, it's the heads of all these groups actually meet together and plan and all work together.
[01:18:35.829 --> 01:18:37.910]  So we should all work together against evil.
[01:18:40.212 --> 01:18:41.013]  Alright, it's that simple.
[01:18:42.033 --> 01:18:43.454]  And obviously, you know my view on this.
[01:18:43.494 --> 01:18:45.155]  Get away from organized religion, folks.
[01:18:45.215 --> 01:18:46.136]  Get out of these churches.
[01:18:46.997 --> 01:18:49.118]  Whether they're Catholic or Protestant, they're bad news.
[01:18:49.599 --> 01:18:50.179]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:54.418 --> 01:19:00.923]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[01:19:01.163 --> 01:19:05.146]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[01:19:05.426 --> 01:19:07.587]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[01:19:07.927 --> 01:19:14.972]  All-natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[01:19:15.293 --> 01:19:17.894]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:19:18.154 --> 01:19:21.637]  My toenails now look clear, and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[01:19:21.937 --> 01:19:29.842]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:19:30.203 --> 01:19:31.724]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[01:19:31.984 --> 01:19:46.673]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:19:47.094 --> 01:19:49.155]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clear and
[01:19:50.019 --> 01:19:52.471]  And feet that look great in sandals.
[01:19:54.344 --> 01:19:54.945]  Hello, folks.
[01:19:55.045 --> 01:19:55.965]  Alex Jones here.
[01:19:56.085 --> 01:20:00.189]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:20:00.329 --> 01:20:03.211]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:20:03.291 --> 01:20:10.016]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:20:10.197 --> 01:20:13.199]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:20:13.399 --> 01:20:15.801]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:20:15.921 --> 01:20:20.645]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[01:20:20.845 --> 01:20:35.393]  Try Halo Methanes and volatile organic elements such as Aptazine, Benzene, Fluoride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:20:35.553 --> 01:20:42.237]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-888-7000.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:46.062]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:46.082 --> 01:20:47.406]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:20:55.043 --> 01:20:57.264]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:57.684 --> 01:21:02.047]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:21:02.327 --> 01:21:08.130]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:08.350 --> 01:21:12.412]  The truth is, very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:12.693 --> 01:21:17.595]  However, they have become the elite group, more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:21:17.615 --> 01:21:18.856]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:26.340]  By mid-1983 it was close to $500 an ounce.
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.502]  In 1986 gold collector coins had quadrupled.
[01:21:29.822 --> 01:21:32.123]  Don't procrastinate this opportunity away.
[01:21:32.523 --> 01:21:36.145]  All the bottom line fundamentals still support a strong future for gold.
[01:21:36.626 --> 01:21:42.829]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for a free evaluation of your gold portfolio.
[01:21:43.249 --> 01:21:44.250]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.910]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:44.930 --> 01:21:45.110]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:58.370]  Imagine enjoying your own health spa in the comfort of your own home daily at a fraction of the cost.
[01:21:58.631 --> 01:21:59.531]  No more imagining.
[01:21:59.711 --> 01:22:03.652]  It's time to experience the relaxing and rejuvenating Total Health Spa by HTE.
[01:22:03.732 --> 01:22:16.016]  The Total Health Spa consists of two medical devices working together to promote increased circulation and oxygenation, help to support proper body function through detoxification, cell regeneration, stress reduction, and so much more.
[01:22:16.176 --> 01:22:19.337]  The Total Health Spa begins with the original and only Qi machine.
[01:22:19.577 --> 01:22:30.828]  The G-Machine, which is a FDA-regulated as a Class I medical device, maximizes the movement of the body, which helps to provide relief through increased oxygen levels, allowing a sense of extreme comfort and pleasure.
[01:22:31.009 --> 01:22:32.790]  Enhance your experience with the Hot House.
[01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:37.295]  The Hot House produces its unique effects through beneficial radiant barns for red rays.
[01:22:37.555 --> 01:22:39.896]  It makes you feel absolutely terrific.
[01:22:39.996 --> 01:22:43.697]  The most effective and affordable complete body treatment available today.
[01:22:43.897 --> 01:22:49.179]  Call now and experience the total health spot for a 14-day unconditional money-back guarantee.
[01:22:49.319 --> 01:22:49.899]  Call now, 1-877-300-0040.
[01:22:49.979 --> 01:22:51.079]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:22:51.119 --> 01:22:58.461]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:07.914]  All right, let's get to calls.
[01:23:07.994 --> 01:23:15.236]  I'm going to give each caller about 60 seconds so we can get through all these great calls and get to all the news we haven't covered yet.
[01:23:15.517 --> 01:23:16.137]  There's a lot of it.
[01:23:16.977 --> 01:23:20.298]  Let's go ahead and go to Joel in Wisconsin.
[01:23:20.318 --> 01:23:21.099]  Joel, go ahead.
[01:23:21.459 --> 01:23:23.680]  Actually, it's Joel, but two things.
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:27.561]  I can't believe you missed one of the hate lists for the New World Order.
[01:23:27.901 --> 01:23:29.422]  They don't like passionate people.
[01:23:29.802 --> 01:23:34.484]  Anyway, what I called about was I think that the government is compliant in job loss.
[01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:36.352]  I had a couple of points.
[01:23:36.812 --> 01:23:45.579]  I want to write an article for you, but remember in FDR's time, they had the make-work jobs, and joblessness basically didn't exist.
[01:23:45.859 --> 01:23:48.421]  Today, job loss equals competitiveness.
[01:23:48.841 --> 01:23:52.203]  It's normal, natural, and you want it because it sells their goods overseas.
[01:23:52.704 --> 01:24:02.311]  I mean, if FDR were to say, we want job loss... Bush said two years ago that our number one export is jobs.
[01:24:02.551 --> 01:24:04.092]  And the number one is Mexicans, yeah.
[01:24:06.513 --> 01:24:11.696]  Another thing is that unions were formed to address workers' rights, and they've become corrupted and bloated.
[01:24:12.837 --> 01:24:16.819]  The Constitution, it supports general welfare, not special interest groups.
[01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:20.662]  The NAFTA and GATT people, you know, things like that.
[01:24:21.302 --> 01:24:23.103]  And the centralizing of power and wealth.
[01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:28.366]  It's a lot easier to manipulate something centralized than decentralized.
[01:24:28.607 --> 01:24:32.149]  So they try to get, like, Ted Turner's and things like that,
[01:24:32.731 --> 01:24:33.332]  We're good to go.
[01:24:49.946 --> 01:24:52.527]  You were saying before about people who are jobless.
[01:24:52.867 --> 01:24:57.009]  I think they're being blamed for their limitations, things that they can't change.
[01:24:57.530 --> 01:25:04.033]  Because I've heard stories about people working at IBM that were sent home because their socks didn't match.
[01:25:04.293 --> 01:25:05.853]  And that's a conformity problem.
[01:25:06.494 --> 01:25:08.235]  They want people that are fearful.
[01:25:08.255 --> 01:25:08.915]  Well, I know this.
[01:25:09.035 --> 01:25:11.756]  Fifteen years ago, you didn't see any homeless on the streets.
[01:25:11.856 --> 01:25:13.837]  I mean, they were very rare in Texas.
[01:25:14.457 --> 01:25:15.398]  And then they just...
[01:25:16.252 --> 01:25:26.161]  Cut all the funding for the mental institutions because that funding now goes to basically get kids into the system for drugging, not for actually treating people that have real brain problems.
[01:25:26.621 --> 01:25:29.504]  And so they dumped all the schizophrenics and the rest of them on the streets.
[01:25:30.083 --> 01:25:38.548]  Well, what I need is a source, like Bureau of Labor Statistics, where I could find how the government has been fine-tuning and tweaking.
[01:25:38.948 --> 01:25:45.892]  You don't need to manipulate who gets hired and who doesn't, as long as they already do it for you.
[01:25:45.952 --> 01:25:46.633]  Well, it's simple.
[01:25:46.773 --> 01:25:53.137]  I mean, if you let China have a 40-plus percent tariff on 2% tariffs in the U.S., that's going to get rid of the jobs.
[01:25:53.157 --> 01:25:53.677]  Thanks for the call.
[01:25:54.458 --> 01:25:58.859]  And, you know, more and more regulations, more and more control on companies that stay here.
[01:25:59.279 --> 01:26:00.440]  No controls if you leave.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:02.680]  Tax incentive to leave.
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:10.302]  It should be industrialized so then they can come back with government jobs and welfare and get you addicted.
[01:26:11.222 --> 01:26:13.483]  Let's go ahead and talk to Frank.
[01:26:14.534 --> 01:26:16.375]  Alex, I'm a first-time caller.
[01:26:16.735 --> 01:26:21.718]  I've heard you on Coast to Coast, and I've been listening to you on the shortwave, and let me take my hat off to you.
[01:26:21.758 --> 01:26:23.719]  You're doing a great job, to say the least.
[01:26:23.999 --> 01:26:25.480]  Well, you're calling us from Pennsylvania.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.581]  Good to have you on board.
[01:26:26.621 --> 01:26:27.221]  What's on your mind?
[01:26:27.401 --> 01:26:33.225]  Well, a couple things I'd like to bring to issue is the fact that as long as these corporate media types...
[01:26:34.105 --> 01:26:48.420]  Keep continuing to put out a falsified belief system and shroud it into people's minds so this way here they can empower themselves to a higher, greater level of things where they're turning the people into sheeple and they're using terrorism as a form of scarerism.
[01:26:50.774 --> 01:26:51.655]  Well, absolutely.
[01:26:51.716 --> 01:27:00.268]  I mean, we even have government handbooks and public statements where they go, we'll use terror or we'll manufacture it to scare these people into submission.
[01:27:00.489 --> 01:27:02.972]  And this stuff hasn't been just happening overnight.
[01:27:03.012 --> 01:27:06.077]  No, this stuff goes back to the foundation and the foundings of this country.
[01:27:06.906 --> 01:27:15.769]  The only thing is, we're in a dumbed-down society in this day and age, and they don't want people to know information or knowledge because both of these things are something that they want all for themselves.
[01:27:16.269 --> 01:27:23.292]  But not to get off the subject, but something about the cell phones, something that you'll never find in any of these manufactured cell phones is a disclaimer
[01:27:23.972 --> 01:27:31.315]  More or less stating that if you use our product over a span of time, you're going to end up contracting brain cancer or any other kind of ill effects.
[01:27:31.435 --> 01:27:45.039]  And by the way, for those who don't know, there are literally hundreds of major government, private university studies from Switzerland and England and the U.S., China, Japan, France, Germany, Russia.
[01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.680]  I mean, it is conclusive.
[01:27:48.341 --> 01:27:49.561]  Fries your eyeballs.
[01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:51.445]  Fries your brain.
[01:27:51.605 --> 01:27:52.726]  It is microwave.
[01:27:53.207 --> 01:27:57.292]  And folks, we're not saying don't use a cell phone, but have a wireless unit.
[01:27:58.496 --> 01:28:03.398]  And keep the cell phone at least a foot away from any body part.
[01:28:03.558 --> 01:28:05.219]  That's the real danger level.
[01:28:05.539 --> 01:28:07.540]  And again, we procrastinate.
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:10.341]  We know the government's evil, but we don't do anything about it.
[01:28:10.601 --> 01:28:14.163]  It's like we know cell phones are killing us, so we give them to our children.
[01:28:14.803 --> 01:28:18.465]  Where's the Consumer Protection Agency and these people when it comes to these items?
[01:28:18.625 --> 01:28:22.927]  Well, it's like they'll pull some drug because it causes heart problems that's for...
[01:28:24.136 --> 01:28:24.736]  We're on the march.
[01:28:24.756 --> 01:28:25.596]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:25.656 --> 01:28:27.497]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.812 --> 01:28:57.193]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:28:57.433 --> 01:28:57.773]  Why?
[01:28:57.793 --> 01:29:00.714]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?
[01:29:00.814 --> 01:29:05.756]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[01:29:05.876 --> 01:29:15.579]  The all-natural ingredients in Cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.
[01:29:15.759 --> 01:29:20.021]  Right now, as a special for GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping.
[01:29:21.041 --> 01:29:21.461]  We're good to go.
[01:29:42.427 --> 01:29:43.668]  Don't let heart disease beat you.
[01:29:43.688 --> 01:29:46.171]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:29:53.937 --> 01:29:55.918]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:55.998 --> 01:30:06.701]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:07.081 --> 01:30:11.603]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.663 --> 01:30:22.987]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.587 --> 01:30:30.437]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.838 --> 01:30:32.981]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:33.462 --> 01:30:38.429]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.729 --> 01:30:45.032]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.112 --> 01:30:49.294]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:49.534 --> 01:30:50.334]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:57.075 --> 01:31:00.317]  Nothing like the power and exhilaration of a two-cycle dirt bike.
[01:31:00.557 --> 01:31:03.119]  But repairs can be costly and time-consuming.
[01:31:03.459 --> 01:31:08.162]  Introducing Protecta Synthetic Two-Cycle Oil for top performance and ultimate protection.
[01:31:08.443 --> 01:31:14.207]  Protecta reduces piston failure, less plug fouling, outstanding heat control, and low smoke.
[01:31:14.487 --> 01:31:17.549]  So when it comes to real performance, get more when you treat it right.
[01:31:17.749 --> 01:31:19.510]  With Protecta from SFR.
[01:31:19.810 --> 01:31:20.571]  Available today.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:26.606]  Did you know that many of the major oil companies have reduced detergents and gasoline as much as 50% since 1996?
[01:31:27.027 --> 01:31:33.014]  Car manufacturers are calling for better quality fuel as performance is being robbed in as little as 5,000 miles.
[01:31:33.374 --> 01:31:34.716]  There is an immediate solution.
[01:31:35.036 --> 01:31:36.998]  Try Protected Complete Fuel System Treatment.
[01:31:37.258 --> 01:31:40.983]  That restores new car performance and improves mileage in one tank full.
[01:31:41.263 --> 01:31:43.185]  Start putting some of the money back into your pocket.
[01:31:43.405 --> 01:31:46.567]  Get more when you treat it right with Protector from SFR.
[01:31:46.848 --> 01:31:47.728]  Available today.
[01:31:48.129 --> 01:31:51.872]  For a store near you, go to sfrcorp.com or call 888-USE-SFR.
[01:31:54.025 --> 01:32:02.390]  All right, let's blast through five more calls, and I'm going to plunge into the news.
[01:32:02.410 --> 01:32:05.332]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to Mark in Las Vegas, Nevada.
[01:32:05.452 --> 01:32:05.972]  Welcome, Mark.
[01:32:05.992 --> 01:32:06.512]  Hey, Alex.
[01:32:06.532 --> 01:32:08.453]  How are you doing?
[01:32:08.593 --> 01:32:08.954]  Good.
[01:32:21.125 --> 01:32:27.546]  I heard you talking to Cindy Sheehan about the possibility that she might get arrested for having a peaceful protest.
[01:32:28.166 --> 01:32:44.549]  It sort of brought back to my mind, I don't know if you've ever heard about this case, but a lady by the name of Elena Sassauer from New York, she has an organization that's like Center for Judicial Accountability.
[01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:47.690]  And about a year or so ago,
[01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:53.151]  She decided to show up to a hearing in the Senate.
[01:32:53.251 --> 01:32:59.073]  It was being presided over by Senator Saxby Chambliss from Georgia, I think it is.
[01:32:59.293 --> 01:33:03.354]  I know there was a case in New York where the guys told a lawyer joke and were arrested.
[01:33:03.794 --> 01:33:17.798]  Yeah, what she did at the end of this hearing, it was a hearing for one of Bush's nominees, one of the judicial nominees, being presided over by Senator Saxby Chambliss.
[01:33:18.334 --> 01:33:29.663]  At the end, she just got up and very politely asked if she could... She said, there's citizen opposition, evidence of corruption by this judge.
[01:33:30.223 --> 01:33:31.124]  May I testify?
[01:33:31.184 --> 01:33:32.565]  May I share information?
[01:33:33.405 --> 01:33:38.309]  And Senator Saxby Chambliss ordered that she be arrested.
[01:33:39.230 --> 01:33:41.912]  And she was charged with disrupting Congress.
[01:33:41.972 --> 01:33:42.332]  In fact,
[01:33:43.486 --> 01:33:45.606]  There's even a video clip she has on her website.
[01:33:45.806 --> 01:33:47.607]  I can see this, but... What's her website?
[01:33:47.807 --> 01:33:49.807]  It's judgewatch.org.
[01:33:49.827 --> 01:33:51.708]  I was thinking, she'd make a good guest.
[01:33:52.128 --> 01:33:56.428]  She ended up serving six months in jail in Washington, D.C.
[01:33:56.468 --> 01:34:02.930]  for asking if she could... I remember hearing about that, and send me an email to make sure I don't forget.
[01:34:02.970 --> 01:34:03.810]  I want to get her on.
[01:34:04.230 --> 01:34:10.311]  Listen, I got kidnapped for... Now, again, the governor's office released back in 1998...
[01:34:12.461 --> 01:34:15.224]  The governor's office released the speech he was going to be giving.
[01:34:15.764 --> 01:34:19.368]  And it said, we'll take questions from the press for ten minutes after.
[01:34:19.948 --> 01:34:21.209]  So he finished his speech.
[01:34:22.170 --> 01:34:23.632]  I knew how he closed.
[01:34:24.052 --> 01:34:24.813]  He said, thank you.
[01:34:24.833 --> 01:34:26.274]  And that's what we're going to do with Texas.
[01:34:26.334 --> 01:34:26.734]  Thank you.
[01:34:27.375 --> 01:34:28.236]  And I said, Governor!
[01:34:29.611 --> 01:34:37.617]  Isn't, you know, the problem that Texas is having is the New World Order, is the Council on Foreign Relations, the Federal Reserve.
[01:34:38.017 --> 01:34:39.278]  Governor, don't you care about America?
[01:34:39.298 --> 01:34:40.078]  Why don't you talk about that?
[01:34:40.379 --> 01:34:42.400]  And by then they grabbed me, and everybody's seen that video.
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:45.122]  It's in several of my documentaries, and it's on the website.
[01:34:45.182 --> 01:34:56.750]  But they should have tried to charge me with something, but instead, because there's nothing to charge me with, this was at the DuPont photo masking plant employee auditorium.
[01:34:56.830 --> 01:34:57.651]  It was in an auditorium.
[01:34:57.991 --> 01:34:59.192]  Public, opened to the public.
[01:35:00.552 --> 01:35:04.435]  And they drove me around for 45 minutes and then threw me out on the side of the highway.
[01:35:05.656 --> 01:35:07.238]  Wouldn't take me back to my car.
[01:35:08.299 --> 01:35:09.099]  Wouldn't do anything.
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:11.541]  People go, well, you deserve it.
[01:35:12.782 --> 01:35:15.284]  What about Mr. Keyes?
[01:35:16.726 --> 01:35:20.649]  Now, Alan Keyes was an ambassador under Reagan.
[01:35:21.450 --> 01:35:26.534]  And Alan Keyes was in the RNC debates.
[01:35:27.725 --> 01:35:29.946]  I even went and covered one of the debates.
[01:35:30.406 --> 01:35:35.489]  He was in a Republican nominee debate in Dallas.
[01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:41.571]  And then he went to go to be in another debate.
[01:35:41.691 --> 01:35:42.792]  I forget, where was it?
[01:35:43.212 --> 01:35:44.112]  Somewhere in the Midwest.
[01:35:44.232 --> 01:35:44.813]  I forget now.
[01:35:44.893 --> 01:35:48.874]  Actually, I think it was out on the East Coast, wasn't it?
[01:35:49.815 --> 01:35:52.916]  Well, wherever it was, it was all over the news because I saw him testify.
[01:35:53.196 --> 01:35:54.217]  He shows up and...
[01:35:55.037 --> 01:35:58.059]  They had decided that they weren't going to allow him to be in the debate.
[01:35:58.519 --> 01:36:01.001]  Now, officially, he was in the newspapers as being part of it.
[01:36:01.381 --> 01:36:02.281]  Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:36:03.002 --> 01:36:03.202]  Huh?
[01:36:03.422 --> 01:36:04.103]  I think it was Atlanta.
[01:36:04.443 --> 01:36:04.723]  Yeah.
[01:36:04.903 --> 01:36:14.689]  Wherever it was, this was like in 96, they drive him around for an hour and throw him out in a crack neighborhood by some basketball courts.
[01:36:15.509 --> 01:36:18.091]  So, this is our government, folks.
[01:36:18.111 --> 01:36:19.232]  They actually kidnap people.
[01:36:19.672 --> 01:36:24.615]  Yeah, you don't want to interfere with one of their stage-managed theatrical productions.
[01:36:26.036 --> 01:36:33.941]  You know, I mean, yeah, that's like interrupting actors in the middle of filming their shows.
[01:36:35.362 --> 01:36:36.503]  Yeah, you show up to Congress.
[01:36:37.443 --> 01:36:41.386]  It's disruption of Congress if you try to point anything out.
[01:36:41.606 --> 01:36:41.986]  I hear you.
[01:36:42.026 --> 01:36:42.767]  Thanks for the call.
[01:36:42.947 --> 01:36:48.390]  And look, none of this has anything to do with fighting terrorists.
[01:36:49.031 --> 01:36:55.299]  But across the board, they're saying, we're going to set up checkpoints and search you for drugs and guns and contraband.
[01:36:55.839 --> 01:36:58.443]  Hey, we're not going to allow you to protest anymore.
[01:36:59.043 --> 01:37:07.574]  Hey, your 11-year-old throws a rock in a pebble fight, she's going to be charged as a criminal and the SWAT team is going to come get her.
[01:37:08.146 --> 01:37:11.271]  Hey, you argued with us and asked for probable cause.
[01:37:11.311 --> 01:37:12.492]  We're going to taser you.
[01:37:12.853 --> 01:37:20.644]  It's going to be on video, and we're going to taser you with resisting, even though you didn't touch us, and even though we attacked you with 50,000 volts.
[01:37:22.839 --> 01:37:26.541]  Hey, we're going to take your private property without just compensation.
[01:37:26.861 --> 01:37:34.565]  Folks, the Supreme Court ruling isn't just where a city or a county or a state can take your property if some corporation wants it.
[01:37:34.926 --> 01:37:36.967]  They also don't give you just compensation.
[01:37:37.807 --> 01:37:41.189]  The same people that take your property are the ones that judge the value.
[01:37:41.209 --> 01:37:43.410]  It doesn't matter if you're paying taxes at $235,000 a year.
[01:37:43.430 --> 01:37:43.990]  They're going to give you $60,000.
[01:37:44.090 --> 01:37:44.991]  I mean, those are real cases.
[01:37:52.122 --> 01:37:54.403]  So, I mean, this is what this country's turned into, folks.
[01:37:55.444 --> 01:37:56.424]  This is only the beginning.
[01:37:56.964 --> 01:38:03.888]  You see, you have this backdrop of terrorists are going to get us, we've got to take your rights, and then, hey, we're going to order you around now, so shut up.
[01:38:05.729 --> 01:38:09.190]  Oh, you can't protest Parliament anymore.
[01:38:09.271 --> 01:38:18.995]  No one can protest in the park across the street or anywhere else now, and the BBC comes on and goes, well, how dare them in the aftermath of the bombings protest the war?
[01:38:19.235 --> 01:38:20.116]  What does that mean?
[01:38:21.242 --> 01:38:22.524]  Why can't we protest?
[01:38:23.105 --> 01:38:28.251]  Because, again, they know there's things that they're going to do that you're going to go absolutely ape.
[01:38:29.874 --> 01:38:31.556]  They know that you're against the war.
[01:38:32.036 --> 01:38:35.361]  They know even after they blow up a city, you're going to be against the war.
[01:38:35.481 --> 01:38:36.322]  You're seeing through it.
[01:38:37.214 --> 01:38:39.615]  Look, for ten years they've been training police in riot.
[01:38:39.635 --> 01:38:45.737]  They've been giving them federal armored gear and armored vehicles and microwave guns and sound cannons.
[01:38:46.317 --> 01:38:52.140]  They've been giving them all this training because they've got things planned for all of us that we're not going to put up with.
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:52.420]  Listen.
[01:38:54.020 --> 01:39:04.024]  You know, down in Argentina, the Argentinians had the highest standard of living in Latin America.
[01:39:04.907 --> 01:39:05.607]  We're good to go.
[01:39:33.982 --> 01:39:35.563]  And then they brought in total control.
[01:39:35.983 --> 01:39:37.223]  It's called the IMF riot.
[01:39:37.823 --> 01:39:39.164]  They even have handbooks on it.
[01:39:40.624 --> 01:39:42.925]  I mean, it's all designed like this.
[01:39:44.246 --> 01:39:49.928]  And they're going to engineer a great depression in America, folks, to coincide with the next big event, I believe.
[01:39:49.968 --> 01:39:51.288]  And Ron Paul said this as well.
[01:39:52.028 --> 01:39:57.470]  They're going to engineer a depression, and it's going to... That depression... This is in Matrix of Evil, by the way.
[01:39:57.490 --> 01:39:58.310]  A year-old film.
[01:39:58.530 --> 01:39:59.931]  He said it there in a speech.
[01:40:01.030 --> 01:40:20.155]  They're going to engineer this to get control, and then there won't be any jobs, there won't be any factories, there's going to be federal make-work like Franklin Delano Roosevelt did, but this time it won't be building dams or building walkways at the local park or building city buildings.
[01:40:20.736 --> 01:40:27.877]  It's going to be spying on neighbors, running checkpoints, doing gun confiscation sweeps, running checkpoints.
[01:40:27.958 --> 01:40:29.438]  I mean, this is in the federal plans.
[01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:32.246]  Remember that article last week, Fox News?
[01:40:32.566 --> 01:40:35.348]  Pentagon to increase domestic surveillance for counterterrorism.
[01:40:35.849 --> 01:40:45.858]  Quote, do we want a free people with the notion of privacy enshrined in the Constitution and based on the very clear limits and defined role of government to be in a society...
[01:40:46.158 --> 01:40:53.303]  We're not just the police, but the military are on the street corners gathering intelligence on citizens, sharing that data, manipulating that data.
[01:40:53.404 --> 01:40:58.828]  Ask former Representative Bob Barr, Republican Georgia, a constitutional law expert and civil libertarian.
[01:40:59.148 --> 01:41:01.670]  This document provides a blueprint for doing just that.
[01:41:03.431 --> 01:41:06.473]  And again, sounds like Alex Jones six years ago.
[01:41:06.954 --> 01:41:09.455]  You can get a film I made in 99, Police State 2000.
[01:41:11.044 --> 01:41:12.185]  And it lays it all out.
[01:41:12.646 --> 01:41:13.967]  Did I have a crystal ball?
[01:41:14.087 --> 01:41:15.688]  No, I read the training manuals.
[01:41:16.129 --> 01:41:17.430]  I went to the training ops.
[01:41:17.450 --> 01:41:23.996]  I mean, I got video marines practicing to break your families up, take your guns, and kill you and put you in camps.
[01:41:25.037 --> 01:41:26.638]  Kill you, search you, beat you.
[01:41:27.179 --> 01:41:28.300]  They don't hide it, folks.
[01:41:28.440 --> 01:41:32.404]  I mean, they ask them in questionnaires, will you shoot American citizens?
[01:41:34.946 --> 01:41:36.968]  Look, you know in your guts this is going on.
[01:41:38.456 --> 01:41:39.557]  You know this is happening.
[01:41:39.957 --> 01:41:41.539]  They're threatened by your freedom.
[01:41:41.799 --> 01:41:43.641]  The globalists are threatened by your liberty.
[01:41:44.561 --> 01:41:49.966]  And the average cop, the average Marine Corps captain, the average Army sergeant is a good person.
[01:41:51.267 --> 01:42:03.337]  Just like a good person at Christmas buys their 12-year-old daughter the cell phone when literally hundreds of studies conclusively show it is a microwave and it will give you brain cancer.
[01:42:03.498 --> 01:42:05.039]  It will burn your eyes out.
[01:42:08.357 --> 01:42:09.918]  But we all still do it.
[01:42:10.698 --> 01:42:14.560]  We know Coca-Cola and sugar and caffeine is bad for our 10-year-olds.
[01:42:14.860 --> 01:42:16.001]  Why do you give it to them?
[01:42:18.182 --> 01:42:24.205]  We know, you know, as young singles, that going out and having 10 sexual partners a year, you're going to get a disease.
[01:42:24.525 --> 01:42:25.965]  But most people still do it.
[01:42:27.866 --> 01:42:29.407]  We know our government's evil.
[01:42:29.467 --> 01:42:30.428]  We know it's corrupt.
[01:42:30.468 --> 01:42:34.049]  Deep down, we're afraid, so we make excuses to ourselves.
[01:42:34.269 --> 01:42:35.210]  Ah, it's not that bad.
[01:42:35.570 --> 01:42:36.370]  Folks, it's worse.
[01:42:36.671 --> 01:42:37.511]  Literally last night,
[01:42:38.911 --> 01:42:40.092]  I have this little notepad here.
[01:42:40.492 --> 01:42:40.932]  Let me get it.
[01:42:40.952 --> 01:42:42.653]  I wrote like 20 pages of notes.
[01:42:43.034 --> 01:42:44.795]  Things I wanted to talk about with you today.
[01:42:46.136 --> 01:42:49.598]  And last night I was having an epiphany after epiphany.
[01:42:49.618 --> 01:42:55.181]  I don't want to call it a vision, but I was just understanding even more and seeing more of their plan.
[01:42:56.042 --> 01:42:56.742]  It was incredible.
[01:42:58.003 --> 01:43:03.306]  It was just a spiritual experience I had last night.
[01:43:03.346 --> 01:43:04.467]  I was just sitting in a chair.
[01:43:04.527 --> 01:43:05.467]  It was just for hours.
[01:43:05.507 --> 01:43:06.648]  It was very intense.
[01:43:06.708 --> 01:43:07.889]  My mind was working fast.
[01:43:08.954 --> 01:43:10.615]  At a much higher level.
[01:43:12.336 --> 01:43:19.763]  And it's like trying to fit the amount of information going over Niagara Falls into a McDonald's straw.
[01:43:21.624 --> 01:43:22.425]  But you know it.
[01:43:22.525 --> 01:43:23.185]  You feel it.
[01:43:23.266 --> 01:43:23.846]  You see it.
[01:43:23.866 --> 01:43:26.708]  I mean, folks, it's so horrible.
[01:43:27.129 --> 01:43:32.974]  Picture us like cattle trapped in squeeze chutes at a slaughterhouse.
[01:43:33.694 --> 01:43:35.676]  And the globalists just see us as cattle.
[01:43:37.586 --> 01:43:38.767]  And it's more than that, though.
[01:43:38.807 --> 01:43:39.908]  They hate our beauty.
[01:43:40.208 --> 01:43:41.428]  They hate our intelligence.
[01:43:41.448 --> 01:43:42.409]  They hate our freedom.
[01:43:42.789 --> 01:43:44.971]  They are threatened by our dynamism.
[01:43:45.011 --> 01:43:50.814]  They are threatened by the wild surges of the human species and creativity and beauty.
[01:43:52.075 --> 01:43:53.876]  These are inbred evil people.
[01:43:53.956 --> 01:43:55.777]  It's a wrinkle in creation.
[01:43:57.338 --> 01:44:03.682]  An anomaly that the most ruthless and the most destructive get into positions of power.
[01:44:04.543 --> 01:44:06.384]  Six thousand plus years ago,
[01:44:07.452 --> 01:44:14.234]  It was the strong, intelligent person who got into power because the small band was always in danger of extinction.
[01:44:15.294 --> 01:44:18.915]  An invasion by neighboring clans and neighboring tribes.
[01:44:19.955 --> 01:44:33.339]  But then in the anomaly of civilization and agrarian society settling down into small towns and then cities, is that then pretty soon the strong man who is the noble leader that Plato wrote about is taken out.
[01:44:34.190 --> 01:44:37.473]  And you always get the backstabbing court counselor.
[01:44:37.873 --> 01:44:39.995]  You always get the warmer Grimewood.
[01:44:40.355 --> 01:44:42.157]  You always get the snake.
[01:44:42.197 --> 01:44:43.798]  He always gets in control.
[01:44:43.818 --> 01:44:46.821]  And he always is threatened by beauty.
[01:44:46.861 --> 01:44:48.422]  And he always hates goodness.
[01:44:48.803 --> 01:44:50.624]  And he is a cancer.
[01:44:51.145 --> 01:44:55.769]  And again, the globalists sit up there and declare themselves gods...
[01:44:56.804 --> 01:44:57.845]  Because they're in control.
[01:44:57.865 --> 01:44:59.225]  They say survival of the fittest.
[01:44:59.646 --> 01:45:00.686]  Social Darwinism.
[01:45:00.746 --> 01:45:01.607]  We're in control.
[01:45:01.967 --> 01:45:04.348]  Thus, that means we have the right of kings.
[01:45:04.368 --> 01:45:06.009]  We're in control because we're the best.
[01:45:06.970 --> 01:45:11.612]  Well, when Peter Jennings died this morning, that cancer wasn't elite.
[01:45:12.313 --> 01:45:13.793]  That cancer wasn't better.
[01:45:14.474 --> 01:45:18.636]  That cancer was a false program.
[01:45:18.896 --> 01:45:20.417]  That cancer was an anomaly.
[01:45:20.577 --> 01:45:23.699]  The cancer was a fire burning down the forest.
[01:45:24.696 --> 01:45:38.439]  But the elite is a cancer, and they sit there crazily and go, well, because we take over, and because we're ruthless, and because we'll kidnap kids and sell them, and because we'll put cancer viruses in the facts, because we're ruthless and evil and inbred and totally decadent and totally spoiled and totally unhappy.
[01:45:38.459 --> 01:45:41.220]  You know, oh, this is our right.
[01:45:41.340 --> 01:45:42.140]  We're gods.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:43.100]  You're scum.
[01:45:44.541 --> 01:45:45.441]  We're lords.
[01:45:45.781 --> 01:45:46.501]  You're nothing.
[01:45:47.626 --> 01:45:54.373]  It's our right to mutate you and do with you what we want because we're in control and that says that we're stronger and we're better.
[01:45:54.613 --> 01:45:55.614]  No, you're not stronger.
[01:45:56.455 --> 01:45:59.038]  It takes strength to lay your life down for the weak.
[01:45:59.458 --> 01:46:02.161]  It takes power to stand up against your fears.
[01:46:02.441 --> 01:46:07.467]  It takes incredible strength not to be greedy, not to be hateful, not to be envious.
[01:46:09.122 --> 01:46:18.234]  To feel the species, to feel the continuity, to feel all the struggles that came before us, the literal ancestral memories.
[01:46:18.334 --> 01:46:25.604]  I don't believe in reincarnation, folks, but ancestral memories, you know, afraid of the dark, instincts.
[01:46:26.724 --> 01:46:46.341]  Sixth Sense, the ancestral memories, everything our species is, everything God put into us, all the pain we went through, everything our forefathers and mothers did to give us something better, and to see a bunch of degenerate, ruthless, cancerous demons taking it over, misprogramming it, screwing everything up,
[01:46:47.234 --> 01:47:01.163]  Enjoying evil, just loving to deface God's creations, loving to just run around greedily annihilating everything good, if your soul doesn't cry out against that.
[01:47:03.351 --> 01:47:17.703]  Just the feeling of commitment and strength and duty that you get when you just let go, turn loose, and join the good side and stand up against the dark side and just give yourself to God.
[01:47:17.863 --> 01:47:19.444]  Give yourself to His creation.
[01:47:19.824 --> 01:47:21.226]  Give yourself to the stream.
[01:47:21.746 --> 01:47:23.147]  Just step into it.
[01:47:23.728 --> 01:47:24.708]  Give yourself up.
[01:47:25.309 --> 01:47:27.991]  Give yourselves up and we can have everything.
[01:47:28.011 --> 01:47:30.853]  We can have beauty and love and follow God's plan.
[01:47:31.094 --> 01:47:32.615]  If we don't, it's over.
[01:47:35.589 --> 01:47:38.831]  We have cancer, folks, just like Peter Jennings had cancer.
[01:47:39.332 --> 01:47:42.014]  Four months ago, he was happy looking for 20 more years of life.
[01:47:42.054 --> 01:47:43.275]  He's dead this morning.
[01:47:45.196 --> 01:47:47.618]  He made decisions he thought wouldn't catch up with him.
[01:47:48.439 --> 01:47:49.619]  It's like the cell phones.
[01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:57.485]  Don't be standing over your daughter when she's 40 and you're 60 and she's died of that big fat brain tumor because she was on that phone 10 hours a day.
[01:48:00.027 --> 01:48:00.788]  It's conclusive.
[01:48:01.928 --> 01:48:02.769]  Get rid of it now.
[01:48:02.849 --> 01:48:03.990]  Get them the wireless units.
[01:48:04.964 --> 01:48:07.948]  Exercise control over them until they're smart enough not to do it.
[01:48:07.968 --> 01:48:11.313]  And it's the same thing with society.
[01:48:11.373 --> 01:48:12.715]  The elite is a cancer.
[01:48:13.661 --> 01:48:14.681]  In every respect.
[01:48:14.841 --> 01:48:16.702]  And you are not the elite.
[01:48:17.042 --> 01:48:18.363]  You do not have the vision.
[01:48:18.663 --> 01:48:20.143]  You do not know what you're doing.
[01:48:20.203 --> 01:48:22.064]  You are deformed.
[01:48:22.144 --> 01:48:23.725]  You are false.
[01:48:23.885 --> 01:48:25.085]  You are a counterfeit.
[01:48:25.125 --> 01:48:26.245]  You are disgusting.
[01:48:26.585 --> 01:48:30.847]  You are postulant, scrofulous, abscesses.
[01:48:31.367 --> 01:48:32.428]  You are a disease.
[01:48:32.448 --> 01:48:33.968]  You are the stench of death.
[01:48:34.268 --> 01:48:35.168]  You are ugly.
[01:48:35.509 --> 01:48:36.509]  You are impure.
[01:48:37.446 --> 01:48:39.227]  You are going to hell.
[01:48:39.287 --> 01:48:40.248]  You are hell.
[01:48:40.448 --> 01:48:42.769]  That's because you're going to hell because you are hell.
[01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:44.911]  Hell is hell and you are hell.
[01:48:48.493 --> 01:49:00.260]  If you love beauty, if you love love, if you love everything decent and pure and good, if you love the mist in the morning and the stars at night and beautiful cold rivers to stick your feet in them, then you love God, folks.
[01:49:00.621 --> 01:49:05.784]  But if you are greedy and hateful and just want more power and control, then you are of your father, the devil.
[01:49:09.173 --> 01:49:10.974]  It's time to get away from the cancer.
[01:49:11.274 --> 01:49:13.336]  From that that comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:49:13.616 --> 01:49:16.337]  That which its very nature is destruction.
[01:49:19.119 --> 01:49:21.441]  It is time to embrace life.
[01:49:22.001 --> 01:49:27.224]  And if that means giving your life up, you save your life when you're willing to give it up.
[01:49:27.264 --> 01:49:30.606]  When you're trying to hold on to your life, you create a climate where you're not safe.
[01:49:31.487 --> 01:49:34.789]  When we're men, when we stand up and we're strong,
[01:49:35.888 --> 01:49:36.668]  Everybody's safe.
[01:49:36.808 --> 01:49:38.809]  When we become cowards, nobody's safe.
[01:49:39.409 --> 01:49:41.450]  A coward thinks he's safe because he's a coward.
[01:49:43.031 --> 01:49:43.831]  It's a fraud.
[01:49:44.251 --> 01:49:48.073]  We'll come back, take calls, cover a lot of news, but you've just got some preaching, folks.
[01:49:53.786 --> 01:49:55.287]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.507 --> 01:49:58.589]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.729 --> 01:50:02.611]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.671 --> 01:50:06.914]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:07.254 --> 01:50:11.016]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.096 --> 01:50:12.977]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.177 --> 01:50:16.459]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.499 --> 01:50:21.222]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.382 --> 01:50:24.423]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.604 --> 01:50:27.445]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.945 --> 01:50:34.069]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.589 --> 01:50:36.432]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:53.491 --> 01:50:57.374]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.594 --> 01:51:03.059]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.319 --> 01:51:13.687]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:13.847 --> 01:51:18.191]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.371 --> 01:51:26.734]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:26.994 --> 01:51:33.336]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.396 --> 01:51:35.739]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:35.759 --> 01:51:35.979]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:52:35.750 --> 01:52:36.010]  I think?
[01:53:02.532 --> 01:53:05.694]  When evil goes unopposed, it just grows and grows.
[01:53:05.714 --> 01:53:10.378]  You think stuff's bad right now, they're just setting the table.
[01:53:11.999 --> 01:53:17.083]  And you and your freedoms and your children's future and their destinies are on the menu.
[01:53:19.925 --> 01:53:24.268]  And they may not pick you off the menu today to eat, but they will down the line.
[01:53:24.308 --> 01:53:25.089]  Your day is coming.
[01:53:26.730 --> 01:53:29.172]  This system is very abusive and very wicked.
[01:53:30.513 --> 01:53:34.014]  It counts on you being self-centered and not caring about anybody but yourself.
[01:53:34.434 --> 01:53:36.915]  And again, through that attitude, you destroy yourself.
[01:53:39.296 --> 01:53:41.957]  Now before I... I'm going to go back to the calls here.
[01:53:42.037 --> 01:53:49.019]  Luke and Dave and Mike and James and Andre and others here in just a moment.
[01:53:49.059 --> 01:53:59.143]  I just briefly in this hour do want to encourage you that if you want powerful tools that have shown themselves to be very effective...
[01:53:59.890 --> 01:54:05.892]  In the past, at waking people up, it makes the job pretty easy.
[01:54:05.932 --> 01:54:10.374]  You need to get my new film, Martial Law, 9-1-1 Rise of the Police State.
[01:54:10.394 --> 01:54:11.454]  It's a miniseries.
[01:54:12.254 --> 01:54:14.775]  It covers three films at once.
[01:54:16.336 --> 01:54:17.936]  Three separate major subjects.
[01:54:19.037 --> 01:54:22.558]  The police state, 9-11, and who the globalists are, and the cult of death.
[01:54:23.038 --> 01:54:24.159]  They worship death, folks.
[01:54:24.179 --> 01:54:25.079]  They actually worship it.
[01:54:26.209 --> 01:54:26.850]  It's unbelievable.
[01:54:27.610 --> 01:54:29.332]  Also, Road to Tyranny is a classic.
[01:54:29.893 --> 01:54:30.894]  American Dictators.
[01:54:30.954 --> 01:54:32.615]  We've got a lot of big discounts right now.
[01:54:33.296 --> 01:54:38.321]  Be sure and visit Infowars.com where you can look at all the different discounts on the bookstore there.
[01:54:39.362 --> 01:54:40.263]  Book and video store.

[01:54:50.382 --> 01:54:50.842]  Don't wait.
[01:54:50.882 --> 01:54:51.722]  Write the number down.
[01:54:51.782 --> 01:54:52.322]  Take action.
[01:54:52.362 --> 01:54:52.983]  Get the videos.
[01:54:53.023 --> 01:54:53.883]  Start making copies.
[01:54:53.923 --> 01:54:54.703]  Get them out to people.
[01:54:54.743 --> 01:54:55.803]  It's had such a big effect.
[01:54:56.223 --> 01:54:57.504]  I want to thank all those that have.
[01:54:58.124 --> 01:54:59.324]  But if you haven't, take action.
[01:54:59.944 --> 01:55:01.944]  If you have the videos and haven't made copies, go ahead.
[01:55:01.984 --> 01:55:06.205]  What's stopping you?
[01:55:06.225 --> 01:55:07.246]  1-888-253-3139.

[01:55:14.787 --> 01:55:15.127]  All right.
[01:55:15.327 --> 01:55:18.348]  Let's go to Luke in Michigan.
[01:55:18.388 --> 01:55:18.868]  Go ahead, Luke.
[01:55:19.893 --> 01:55:22.576]  I have two points to make.
[01:55:24.637 --> 01:55:26.259]  First... Yeah, talk right into your telephone.
[01:55:26.279 --> 01:55:26.619]  Go ahead.
[01:55:26.639 --> 01:55:27.140]  Okay.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:28.741]  Can you hear me now?
[01:55:29.622 --> 01:55:30.262]  I can hear you, sir.
[01:55:30.983 --> 01:55:31.323]  Okay.
[01:55:32.825 --> 01:55:34.626]  I'm having a little bit of trouble waking people up.
[01:55:34.646 --> 01:55:40.571]  Your videos are, martial law is a good video, but the neocons are kind of hard waking up around here.
[01:55:41.092 --> 01:55:42.773]  You're trying to wake your family up, aren't you?
[01:55:43.014 --> 01:55:44.215]  Well, my family's woke up.
[01:55:44.255 --> 01:55:45.736]  This is the people at my church.
[01:55:46.597 --> 01:55:46.817]  They're
[01:55:47.731 --> 01:55:49.692]  They're starting to see things.
[01:55:49.712 --> 01:55:51.493]  They're really mad at Bush over CAFTA.
[01:55:52.973 --> 01:55:55.474]  And yeah, something else on the Invent Domain.
[01:55:55.494 --> 01:56:01.097]  They've been taking things about just conversations for a while.
[01:56:01.497 --> 01:56:08.340]  In fact, in the late 90s, when Detroit put in their casinos, they condemned all this property.
[01:56:08.420 --> 01:56:09.760]  They had nothing wrong with it.
[01:56:10.420 --> 01:56:12.381]  Let's go back to the first thing you said.
[01:56:12.821 --> 01:56:13.121]  Okay.
[01:56:13.722 --> 01:56:16.563]  You said you're having trouble, but now people are waking up.
[01:56:17.159 --> 01:56:19.061]  Well, it starts you to wake up a little bit.
[01:56:20.363 --> 01:56:24.247]  Well, there's your window.
[01:56:24.668 --> 01:56:25.789]  Plant more seeds there.
[01:56:28.172 --> 01:56:29.474]  But again, it isn't about Bush.
[01:56:29.594 --> 01:56:33.298]  I mean, bypass the discussion of Bush being good or Bush being bad.
[01:56:33.719 --> 01:56:35.641]  America's going in the wrong direction.
[01:56:35.981 --> 01:56:37.383]  We've got to do something about it.
[01:56:40.330 --> 01:56:43.931]  They just see it as a choice between Bush and the Democrats.
[01:56:43.951 --> 01:56:46.172]  You've got to show them how that's false first.
[01:56:46.592 --> 01:56:49.893]  Then their resistance evaporates.
[01:56:51.193 --> 01:56:51.554]  I see.
[01:56:53.314 --> 01:56:56.055]  I got another point on the National ID card.
[01:56:56.095 --> 01:57:01.897]  Back before they passed Real ID, I went into Kmart to exchange some things and they had a receipt.
[01:57:02.677 --> 01:57:05.238]  They asked for my driver's license and they swiped it to a machine.
[01:57:06.189 --> 01:57:08.131]  Yeah, it's part of the National ID card.
[01:57:08.151 --> 01:57:09.372]  Most states have already implemented it.
[01:57:09.612 --> 01:57:10.333]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:10.353 --> 01:57:11.114]  Good to hear from you.
[01:57:11.154 --> 01:57:12.114]  Look, just keep it up.
[01:57:13.376 --> 01:57:14.436]  But I would put it this way.
[01:57:14.757 --> 01:57:16.178]  You're starting to have success.
[01:57:16.238 --> 01:57:17.359]  The people are waking up.
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:20.442]  Why would you preface it with, I'm having trouble?
[01:57:22.143 --> 01:57:23.004]  I'm not having trouble.
[01:57:23.064 --> 01:57:23.765]  And let me tell you something.
[01:57:23.785 --> 01:57:29.730]  When you've got the attitude that you don't have trouble, when you have the attitude of a winner, people recognize that.
[01:57:29.750 --> 01:57:30.551]  So have that attitude.
[01:57:33.442 --> 01:57:38.064]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.

[01:57:38.624 --> 01:57:39.544]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.584 --> 01:57:42.765]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:44.926 --> 01:57:47.147]  You want answers?
[01:57:47.407 --> 01:57:48.867]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.649 --> 01:58:01.590]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.831 --> 01:58:05.952]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.132 --> 01:58:15.535]  All right, my friends, we've now got 60 minutes, to be precise, about 59 and a half, spanning out before us.
[01:58:17.416 --> 01:58:25.539]  We're going to be going to Dave and Jamie and Andreas, I believe that's the name.
[01:58:27.092 --> 01:58:28.514]  Coming up here in a few minutes.
[01:58:30.556 --> 01:58:34.940]  And after I take three or four more calls, though, I'm going to plunge back into the news because there's just so much here.
[01:58:35.781 --> 01:58:42.268]  Where they just admit the torture and what's happening in Iraq and the oil prices and the attack on free speech here.
[01:58:42.848 --> 01:58:44.390]  There is just so much going on.
[01:58:45.611 --> 01:58:48.013]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:58:48.133 --> 01:58:48.954]  Dave in Michigan.
[01:58:48.994 --> 01:58:49.575]  Go ahead, Dave.
[01:58:50.903 --> 01:59:03.794]  Alex, I've heard you say a few times on the air, indirectly while talking about other subjects, mentioning that, I don't know how to put this, but it doesn't seem that you're a big fan of the NRA, okay?
[01:59:04.334 --> 01:59:08.878]  And it kind of disturbs me because a friend of mine had me become a member of that when I was going for my CCW.
[01:59:09.879 --> 01:59:12.341]  What is it about the NRA that you don't agree with?
[01:59:12.661 --> 01:59:16.464]  And I just would like you to expound on what is maybe bad within that organization.
[01:59:17.828 --> 01:59:30.364]  Oh, they'll have big theatrical events where they hold up guns and say, you can take it from my cold, dead hands, and we've had, before he retired, Mr. Heston on this show.
[01:59:31.165 --> 01:59:33.628]  But, I mean, the NRA is loyal opposition.
[01:59:33.708 --> 01:59:35.471]  They go into federal court and say...
[01:59:37.489 --> 01:59:45.734]  Their position is only a few degrees away from the gun control position, and they like purposefully basically lose cases to create a bad case law.
[01:59:46.114 --> 01:59:54.919]  But I've read from the federal cases where they say, we believe guns should be registered and should not be allowed to leave the home, Your Honor.
[01:59:56.800 --> 01:59:58.721]  And, you know, that's their pro-gun position.
[01:59:59.422 --> 02:00:05.065]  And we had the NRA quietly try to defeat us in Texas.
[02:00:05.785 --> 02:00:06.966]  So you're saying that there's... Right.
[02:00:31.579 --> 02:00:38.101]  Okay, so they're approaching keeping our gun rights as like a compromise rather than as a full-on right.
[02:00:38.121 --> 02:00:45.544]  In other words, they're willing to give part of our rights away to keep just the right to hold on.
[02:00:45.584 --> 02:00:46.564]  Let me tell you a little secret.
[02:00:46.584 --> 02:00:47.965]  Let me tell you a little secret.
[02:00:48.865 --> 02:00:57.988]  As much as I like Chuck Heston, great actor, great guy, he campaigned for the 68 Gun Control Act.
[02:00:59.549 --> 02:00:59.849]  Wow.
[02:01:00.816 --> 02:01:01.396]  Yeah, look it up.
[02:01:02.857 --> 02:01:04.278]  One time I almost jumped.
[02:01:04.699 --> 02:01:06.640]  I mean, literally almost had a heart attack and missed it.
[02:01:08.501 --> 02:01:10.783]  But it was on TV and I did miss it.
[02:01:11.684 --> 02:01:18.248]  They had some show about the history of gun control on TV and it was Chuck Heston in the 60s in a TV ad promoting gun control.
[02:01:19.249 --> 02:01:22.431]  I mean, I already knew about it, but I was watching TV once and saw it.
[02:01:24.533 --> 02:01:24.933]  Wow.
[02:01:25.990 --> 02:01:27.091]  Thanks for the call, my friend.
[02:01:27.751 --> 02:01:29.252]  I should do a show on that sometime.
[02:01:30.012 --> 02:01:32.994]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jamie in Kentucky.
[02:01:33.034 --> 02:01:33.334]  Jamie?
[02:01:33.654 --> 02:01:34.174]  Hey, Alex.
[02:01:34.735 --> 02:01:34.995]  Hi.
[02:01:35.395 --> 02:01:37.116]  They're a bunch of Satanists, all they are.
[02:01:38.357 --> 02:01:39.477]  George Bush and all of them.
[02:01:40.898 --> 02:01:43.920]  And they're going to hell for what they're doing to America.
[02:01:45.901 --> 02:01:47.602]  Well, they're turning America into hell.
[02:01:48.582 --> 02:01:53.765]  But I also believe that, you know, since we're talking about the Bible...
[02:01:54.651 --> 02:01:59.435]  It says in the Bible that if we turn from our wicked ways, they'll hail our land.
[02:02:00.475 --> 02:02:02.997]  But America's not turning from their wicked ways.
[02:02:05.299 --> 02:02:08.141]  You know, there's homosexuality.
[02:02:08.421 --> 02:02:12.784]  And even so-called Christians are saying, good, torture people, that's Christian.
[02:02:13.245 --> 02:02:16.587]  Well, see, I don't believe that myself.
[02:02:16.847 --> 02:02:17.568]  I'm a Christian.
[02:02:18.088 --> 02:02:20.230]  But I'm trying to get the word out at church.
[02:02:20.871 --> 02:02:21.852]  But they turn against me.
[02:02:22.112 --> 02:02:30.981]  I've been told if I say anything else about Bush and him at church, that I'll be taken away, more or less, arrested.
[02:02:31.481 --> 02:02:32.282]  Who told you that?
[02:02:32.702 --> 02:02:34.124]  The cop that's in our church.
[02:02:34.524 --> 02:02:35.665]  I want to hear about it when we get back.
[02:02:35.705 --> 02:02:38.027]  Tell us the story when we return.
[02:02:38.488 --> 02:02:39.068]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:46.764 --> 02:02:49.625]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.885 --> 02:02:51.466]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.806 --> 02:02:56.468]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.808 --> 02:03:01.250]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.670 --> 02:03:05.832]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.072 --> 02:03:08.895]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.995 --> 02:03:13.659]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.859 --> 02:03:18.304]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.504 --> 02:03:25.751]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.991 --> 02:03:28.413]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:47.501 --> 02:03:48.542]  The war on terrorism.
[02:03:48.863 --> 02:03:51.666]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.926 --> 02:03:56.090]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.511 --> 02:03:57.352]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.652 --> 02:04:02.237]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.697 --> 02:04:04.838]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.318 --> 02:04:20.025]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[02:05:40.846 --> 02:05:44.048]  Box 281, Wildwood, PA 15091.
[02:05:44.108 --> 02:05:47.870]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.450 --> 02:05:51.292]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.792 --> 02:05:57.415]  All right, taking a few more calls and going straight into more of the news.
[02:05:59.436 --> 02:06:03.038]  We've got Jeremy in Kentucky.
[02:06:04.038 --> 02:06:04.959]  The Andrea...
[02:06:05.766 --> 02:06:07.587]  And Jason and a few others will be going to.
[02:06:08.828 --> 02:06:12.190]  But finish up your story for those that missed it.
[02:06:12.970 --> 02:06:17.192]  You're at church and you're talking about the New World Order.
[02:06:17.252 --> 02:06:23.075]  I mean, give us an example of what you were saying when the police officer told you if you do that again, you'll be taken away.
[02:06:23.796 --> 02:06:27.958]  Well, they said that I was talking about the New World Order and all that.
[02:06:28.278 --> 02:06:31.740]  And they said, well, Jamie, just because, you know,
[02:06:32.601 --> 02:06:38.064]  You can't believe everything you read or see on TV or on the Internet.
[02:06:38.124 --> 02:06:39.505]  Unless it's George Bush saying it.
[02:06:39.565 --> 02:06:40.586]  Then it's all true.
[02:06:40.606 --> 02:06:41.846]  They're conservative Christians.
[02:06:42.967 --> 02:06:46.629]  But I'm a conservative Christian too, but I'm waking up.
[02:06:46.729 --> 02:06:48.090]  So what did he finally say to you?
[02:06:48.110 --> 02:06:52.052]  I mean, give me an example of what you were saying when he said, you're going to be taken away if you say that again.
[02:06:52.252 --> 02:07:01.858]  Yeah, he said that, Jamie, I'm afraid that if you keep on talking about the New World Order and all the bunch of junk about the Masons and stuff, that...
[02:07:02.802 --> 02:07:06.984]  I'm afraid that you might be taken away, more or less arrested.
[02:07:07.164 --> 02:07:09.225]  So let me just get this straight.
[02:07:09.365 --> 02:07:11.385]  And he's off duty.
[02:07:11.546 --> 02:07:15.387]  We're not living in a police state, but he's telling you you may be taken away.
[02:07:15.627 --> 02:07:16.067]  Mm-hmm.
[02:07:16.167 --> 02:07:17.228]  Okay, for your speech.
[02:07:18.348 --> 02:07:19.209]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:22.330]  In fact, I've had hundreds of people on the street over the years ago.
[02:07:22.590 --> 02:07:23.330]  None of this is true.
[02:07:23.350 --> 02:07:26.752]  You're full of bull, but you're probably going to get arrested for what you're doing.
[02:07:27.252 --> 02:07:31.273]  Oh, I'm not living in a police state, but I'll probably be arrested for what I'm doing.
[02:07:31.314 --> 02:07:32.394]  I thought we had free speech.
[02:07:33.301 --> 02:07:34.001]  Thanks for the call.
[02:07:34.141 --> 02:07:35.482]  Okay.
[02:07:35.582 --> 02:07:36.322]  Let me just say this.
[02:07:36.362 --> 02:07:37.602]  Number one, you're in the wrong church.
[02:07:38.403 --> 02:07:40.103]  You should go complain to the preacher.
[02:07:40.643 --> 02:07:45.144]  You should complain to the police that he threatened you with imprisonment for your speech.
[02:07:45.985 --> 02:07:48.585]  And, of course, you told me off air during a break that he's also a Mason.
[02:07:49.726 --> 02:07:51.746]  And that guy is really bad.
[02:07:51.826 --> 02:07:52.467]  But you know what?
[02:07:52.607 --> 02:07:57.308]  I believe the last caller that we were just talking to,
[02:07:59.935 --> 02:08:03.057]  The reason I believe him is because I've experienced it.
[02:08:03.858 --> 02:08:04.338]  I've seen it.
[02:08:04.499 --> 02:08:12.685]  And it's a minority of police, and it's normally in small towns, and they really think that free speech is illegal.
[02:08:14.566 --> 02:08:22.152]  Lyon County, Kentucky, early last year, this actually made the local newspapers.
[02:08:23.033 --> 02:08:24.754]  We posted the clippings.
[02:08:25.335 --> 02:08:26.996]  We had Kelly rushing on.
[02:08:27.754 --> 02:08:31.316]  A very well-known, you know, a construction company owner.
[02:08:32.356 --> 02:08:33.517]  No criminal record.
[02:08:33.537 --> 02:08:37.718]  The Rushings are middle class, prominent in their small town.
[02:08:40.139 --> 02:08:47.943]  And Kelly made about 15 copies of Ron Paul's speech titled, Neo-Conned.
[02:08:49.544 --> 02:08:56.947]  And the congressman, the veteran and doctor and most conservative voting record in congressional history, literally,
[02:08:57.518 --> 02:08:58.199]  From Texas.
[02:08:58.639 --> 02:09:09.306]  Gave a 45-minute speech where he laid out the statements of Dick Cheney about needing a Pearl Harbor event and bringing in a New World Order and believing in the ideas of Trotsky.
[02:09:10.486 --> 02:09:10.967]  Oh, yes.
[02:09:11.447 --> 02:09:11.847]  Oh, yes.
[02:09:12.988 --> 02:09:15.310]  And he gave them that video.
[02:09:15.930 --> 02:09:17.291]  He handed out about 15 copies.
[02:09:17.611 --> 02:09:22.514]  And he handed out copies of 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:09:24.676 --> 02:09:25.176]  And he...
[02:09:28.303 --> 02:09:33.166]  Went up to the doorstep of a state police officer that lived down the street from him.
[02:09:34.567 --> 02:09:35.308]  He knocked on the door.
[02:09:35.328 --> 02:09:38.249]  He wasn't there, so he left a note and said who he was.
[02:09:38.830 --> 02:09:40.591]  Hey, I'm a friendly neighbor.
[02:09:40.751 --> 02:09:42.052]  Dropped off some of these videos.
[02:09:42.632 --> 02:09:50.097]  I mean, how many times have I had DVDs and videos for AOL or the Seventh Day Adventist or whoever hanging on my door?
[02:09:50.157 --> 02:09:52.719]  I call the cops, and the cop gets them out.
[02:09:53.019 --> 02:09:55.320]  We've listed his name on there, done whole shows on it.
[02:09:56.581 --> 02:09:57.582]  The state police officer
[02:09:58.749 --> 02:10:05.553]  And he gets the tapes and he watches it, watches Ron Paul, watches my video, and this was in the court proceedings, folks.
[02:10:06.694 --> 02:10:08.695]  And he was even more upset by the congressman.
[02:10:09.776 --> 02:10:11.417]  He actually thinks it's illegal.
[02:10:11.858 --> 02:10:15.100]  You know, it's just somebody in the Capitol standing there talking, oh, it must be illegal.
[02:10:15.140 --> 02:10:17.901]  Yeah, that's where they... This is so crazy.
[02:10:19.763 --> 02:10:28.048]  And Kelly was driving along a few days later, and the state police officer, as Kelly pulls out of his house, pulls in behind him, pulls him over, and says, you're under arrest.
[02:10:28.877 --> 02:10:29.737]  Kelly says, why?
[02:10:29.777 --> 02:10:32.298]  This is all in the report, folks.
[02:10:32.338 --> 02:10:33.419]  I've got copies of all of this.
[02:10:34.479 --> 02:10:37.541]  And he says, well, you gave me illegal anti-government videos.
[02:10:37.661 --> 02:10:47.004]  Now, understand, C-SPAN and then Road to Tyranny, you know, this has been written up by the Washington Post and New York Daily News and New York Post.
[02:10:49.305 --> 02:10:53.007]  It's been acclaimed by different reviewers.
[02:10:54.467 --> 02:10:55.728]  It's shown in quite a few theaters.
[02:10:56.761 --> 02:11:01.504]  But regardless, I mean, you got a video, doesn't call for violence, just exposes crime.
[02:11:02.064 --> 02:11:03.085]  The cop watches them.
[02:11:03.165 --> 02:11:05.706]  He showed great knowledge of them in the court proceedings.
[02:11:06.907 --> 02:11:08.408]  And they arrested Kelly.
[02:11:09.288 --> 02:11:10.549]  I even called the judge at home.
[02:11:11.089 --> 02:11:12.971]  When I first heard about it, I got the news article.
[02:11:13.011 --> 02:11:17.213]  I called the judge, talked to the judge, and I did it, by the way, with witnesses.
[02:11:17.253 --> 02:11:25.378]  I didn't record it because that's illegal in some states, but I had my wife sitting there as I talked to him on the phone, on speakerphone, and he just said, well, I'm not going to talk about the case.
[02:11:26.198 --> 02:11:36.300]  Then we got the transcript of it and they brought Kelly in and they charged him with just a whole bunch of different stuff.
[02:11:37.421 --> 02:11:39.641]  And it was amazing.
[02:11:40.481 --> 02:11:44.382]  And the jury found Kelly not guilty.
[02:11:45.923 --> 02:11:51.244]  And poor Kelly Rushing walked up to the state police officer being such a nice person.
[02:11:51.864 --> 02:11:54.965]  It's always really nice country areas where the people are so sweet.
[02:11:57.201 --> 02:12:01.764]  Contrary to some popular propaganda, most small towns are really sweet, nice people.
[02:12:02.804 --> 02:12:06.306]  But you've always got a criminal set, generally, that runs things, in most cases.
[02:12:06.326 --> 02:12:09.147]  Because you've got nice, gullible people to put up with it.
[02:12:09.607 --> 02:12:12.308]  Kelly walked over and said, I'm real sorry about this trouble.
[02:12:13.489 --> 02:12:18.151]  And tried to shake hands with the state trooper, and he turned away and wouldn't even talk to him.
[02:12:19.582 --> 02:12:21.102]  Now imagine this state trooper.
[02:12:21.182 --> 02:12:23.103]  He wanted to ruin Kelly's life.
[02:12:23.143 --> 02:12:25.963]  Kelly was facing a year and a half in jail for the different charges.
[02:12:26.943 --> 02:12:27.963]  Terroristic threats.
[02:12:27.983 --> 02:12:29.264]  They said the video was a threat.
[02:12:30.384 --> 02:12:32.764]  A bunch of other stuff.
[02:12:35.885 --> 02:12:38.685]  Imagine that cop wanted to ruin Kelly's life.
[02:12:38.805 --> 02:12:40.045]  Kelly, no criminal record.
[02:12:40.085 --> 02:12:42.206]  I mean, pillar of the community, folks.
[02:12:42.466 --> 02:12:43.526]  Church three days a week.
[02:12:44.306 --> 02:12:45.226]  No criminal record.
[02:12:45.746 --> 02:12:46.967]  Successful family man.
[02:12:48.227 --> 02:12:48.947]  Pulled over
[02:12:50.106 --> 02:12:52.468]  And they were going to put him in jail for a year and a half.
[02:12:52.508 --> 02:12:53.968]  It was a year and a half per charge.
[02:12:54.989 --> 02:13:02.494]  So he had to spend at least six months in jail with a terroristic threat against a police officer for giving him a video.
[02:13:06.516 --> 02:13:08.017]  For giving him a video.
[02:13:08.637 --> 02:13:14.221]  And the judge sat there and tried to put Kelly in jail.
[02:13:14.301 --> 02:13:15.722]  And the jury found him not guilty.
[02:13:16.162 --> 02:13:17.463]  Thank God for the jury.
[02:13:17.723 --> 02:13:19.064]  That's what the jury's supposed to do.
[02:13:19.753 --> 02:13:29.376]  And Kelly walked over to someone who was trying to ruin his life, put him in prison for caring about him, for trying to reach out to him.
[02:13:30.756 --> 02:13:34.657]  And Kelly turned the other cheek like just an incredibly godly person.
[02:13:37.658 --> 02:13:44.941]  And that piece of trash wouldn't even shake his hand.
[02:13:47.722 --> 02:13:49.964]  Kelly was saying he was sorry.
[02:13:51.245 --> 02:13:53.126]  I'd have sued that piece of trash.
[02:13:53.907 --> 02:13:54.888]  And I warned Kelly.
[02:13:54.948 --> 02:13:57.329]  I said, Kelly, you made a big mistake being nice to him.
[02:13:57.810 --> 02:13:58.731]  You're going to be attacked.
[02:13:59.851 --> 02:14:03.434]  And pretty soon they started pulling him over, harassing him.
[02:14:03.474 --> 02:14:06.396]  Pulled him and his friend over when they were riding horses out on the road.
[02:14:07.257 --> 02:14:09.279]  And tried to claim one of the horses was stolen.
[02:14:09.339 --> 02:14:11.821]  I mean, just tried to claim he was drunk.
[02:14:12.501 --> 02:14:15.563]  Tried to claim that his friend was riding while drunk.
[02:14:16.744 --> 02:14:17.345]  State police.
[02:14:19.457 --> 02:14:21.978]  Now, generally, state police are better than most city cops.
[02:14:22.138 --> 02:14:25.640]  I'm not sitting here bashing state police, but they've got to be bad there.
[02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:29.902]  But what about the Tennessee case that same month that was in the Associated Press, remember?
[02:14:31.102 --> 02:14:35.144]  A man owned a logging company, actually prominent in town.
[02:14:36.525 --> 02:14:37.365]  Got a divorce.
[02:14:37.965 --> 02:14:40.247]  Ex-wife on drugs, according to him.
[02:14:41.687 --> 02:14:44.869]  He loses the divorce case, loses custody of the kids.
[02:14:46.089 --> 02:14:47.650]  Puts a sign up saying...
[02:14:48.334 --> 02:14:50.096]  That the judge didn't give me justice.
[02:14:50.116 --> 02:14:52.397]  I mean, it was really a... We have a photo of this on the website.
[02:14:52.698 --> 02:14:54.659]  A very tame statement.
[02:14:55.940 --> 02:14:57.201]  A very, very tame statement.
[02:14:59.583 --> 02:15:04.827]  And the judge ordered him arrested, and the police came to his house and said, that's disrespectful.
[02:15:05.168 --> 02:15:06.068]  You're in contempt.
[02:15:06.329 --> 02:15:07.730]  This is a year after he's out of the court.
[02:15:08.731 --> 02:15:11.653]  On his own rural road, you know, at his own house.
[02:15:12.554 --> 02:15:13.294]  I remember what it was.
[02:15:13.935 --> 02:15:15.316]  Our court system is a joke.
[02:15:15.436 --> 02:15:15.796]  That was it.
[02:15:17.197 --> 02:15:17.778]  That was the quote.
[02:15:18.479 --> 02:15:20.200]  Our court system is a joke.
[02:15:22.902 --> 02:15:28.365]  And, of course, he had money and lawyers, and the judge got in trouble and almost got kicked off the bench, but that's the mentality.
[02:15:28.385 --> 02:15:31.207]  See, soon they'll be able to operate like that.
[02:15:31.447 --> 02:15:36.890]  Hey, America was the only place where you could stand up to these people that say they're God and say you're not God.
[02:15:36.910 --> 02:15:42.894]  I mean, cops will go to somebody's house because they put a sign up and arrest them, and they told them it was in the Associated Press.
[02:15:42.914 --> 02:15:45.175]  They said, you didn't show respect.
[02:15:45.335 --> 02:15:46.356]  This will teach you, boy.
[02:15:50.287 --> 02:15:52.188]  Because he stuck a sign in his yard.
[02:15:52.248 --> 02:15:55.049]  Folks, they... But don't let this scare you.
[02:15:56.309 --> 02:15:59.050]  Be scared that if you are scared, they're going to win.
[02:15:59.971 --> 02:16:00.811]  Now, be bold.
[02:16:00.851 --> 02:16:02.712]  Decide to stand up on your hind legs.
[02:16:03.532 --> 02:16:04.452]  Trust in God.
[02:16:05.172 --> 02:16:06.033]  Get videos.
[02:16:06.213 --> 02:16:07.153]  Make more copies.
[02:16:07.233 --> 02:16:08.534]  Put up signs in your yard.
[02:16:08.854 --> 02:16:10.534]  Put bumper stickers on your car.
[02:16:11.235 --> 02:16:12.895]  Start going to city council meetings.
[02:16:12.975 --> 02:16:15.976]  Most places aren't like this, and frankly, they're on the defensive now.
[02:16:16.277 --> 02:16:17.457]  They know we're hopping mad.
[02:16:18.726 --> 02:16:19.447]  Let's go to the calls.
[02:16:19.487 --> 02:16:19.947]  I'm sorry.
[02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:22.730]  All of this is so important.
[02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:25.372]  I mean, that's so un-American.
[02:16:26.413 --> 02:16:36.862]  Imagine telling our founding fathers that hundreds of years from now, if you try to give somebody a pamphlet, they'll be arrested if the pamphlet criticizes the government.
[02:16:38.323 --> 02:16:40.665]  They might actually believe it because they just experienced it.
[02:16:40.705 --> 02:16:43.928]  But imagine telling somebody 50 years ago, they'd go, that's Russia!
[02:16:44.268 --> 02:16:45.269]  That's not America!
[02:16:46.482 --> 02:16:47.383]  All right, let's go to calls here.
[02:16:48.304 --> 02:16:49.084]  Who's up next here?
[02:16:51.866 --> 02:16:52.147]  You know what?
[02:16:52.167 --> 02:16:55.109]  I'm just going to hold off so we go to Andrea in Florida and give her time.
[02:16:55.129 --> 02:16:57.751]  And then I'm going to get into some more of the news here.
[02:16:57.771 --> 02:16:58.792]  I mean, there's just so much here.
[02:16:58.832 --> 02:17:00.073]  I covered a lot of it in the first hour.
[02:17:00.534 --> 02:17:03.116]  A lot of it's on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:17:03.636 --> 02:17:09.781]  Big developments on net traffic and statistics for the freedom-loving websites and patriot websites.
[02:17:10.862 --> 02:17:13.845]  And big movements on energy.
[02:17:14.065 --> 02:17:15.306]  Just a lot of stuff happening.
[02:17:16.622 --> 02:17:17.683]  I'm going to jam it all in here.
[02:17:17.703 --> 02:17:18.704]  We can't take many more calls.
[02:17:18.744 --> 02:17:19.384]  A few more calls.
[02:17:19.444 --> 02:17:21.005]  I've got some stuff I want to cover.
[02:17:23.067 --> 02:17:24.508]  I mean, that's why I'm so upset.
[02:17:27.790 --> 02:17:34.095]  I mean, the judge actually gave quotes in the newspaper saying, well, this is the first day the guy was in jail.
[02:17:34.195 --> 02:17:35.736]  He's going to learn some respect.
[02:17:36.196 --> 02:17:38.618]  You're not allowed to talk about me that way.
[02:17:38.778 --> 02:17:42.761]  Hey, Boss Hogg, you're going to lose.
[02:17:45.885 --> 02:17:49.968]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[02:21:54.906 --> 02:22:03.611]  Andrea in Florida, thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:22:03.671 --> 02:22:04.072]  Welcome.
[02:22:04.712 --> 02:22:05.492]  Hello, welcome.
[02:22:05.552 --> 02:22:06.813]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:22:07.293 --> 02:22:09.415]  I just want to say to you, God bless you.
[02:22:09.435 --> 02:22:13.617]  I listened to you on the George Norris show the other night.
[02:22:14.201 --> 02:22:19.382]  And I've been studying this since I was 11 years old about what's going on right now as we speak.
[02:22:20.263 --> 02:22:25.204]  And I just want to tell you that God bless you.
[02:22:26.404 --> 02:22:27.764]  You're doing a wonderful job.
[02:22:28.925 --> 02:22:40.728]  And thank you for informing people on what we have to do because we have other, you know, I've read other readers but then they dropped off.
[02:22:40.768 --> 02:22:41.888]  You know what I mean?
[02:22:43.888 --> 02:22:44.188]  Hello?
[02:22:44.448 --> 02:22:45.489]  Yes, I'm listening.
[02:22:45.589 --> 02:22:46.770]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:49.712]  So we had other readers that we read in the past.
[02:22:49.732 --> 02:22:55.917]  Like I said, I've been studying this since I was 11, so that's been about 15 years now.
[02:22:56.837 --> 02:23:02.121]  And thank you for the show.
[02:23:02.221 --> 02:23:04.783]  I mean, you know, you keep hearing this over and over.
[02:23:05.284 --> 02:23:06.825]  So now we listen to you.
[02:23:07.682 --> 02:23:10.204]  And he's like giving us solutions, solutions.
[02:23:10.264 --> 02:23:11.865]  I'm like, yes, the solutions.
[02:23:11.885 --> 02:23:12.926]  We know the problem.
[02:23:13.287 --> 02:23:14.888]  Let's find the solutions.
[02:23:15.028 --> 02:23:17.150]  Well, a lot of it is just our spirit.
[02:23:17.230 --> 02:23:18.170]  It's our attitude.
[02:23:18.771 --> 02:23:37.286]  I mean, when we love each other and when we're good and when we stand up for what's right and when we put ourselves in front of, you know, the evil for the defenseless, it creates an atmosphere where the virus, the bacteria, the cancer can't spread
[02:23:37.955 --> 02:23:38.055]  Yes.
[02:23:38.115 --> 02:23:39.637]  And it's really just that simple.
[02:23:40.097 --> 02:23:40.298]  Yes.
[02:23:40.999 --> 02:23:45.664]  I mean, in the final equation, it really is about love.
[02:23:46.024 --> 02:23:49.388]  But love means not just going love, love, love, everything's fine.
[02:23:49.788 --> 02:23:52.832]  Love is going split-second instinct.
[02:23:53.422 --> 02:23:53.602]  Yes.
[02:23:53.662 --> 02:23:53.883]  Yes.
[02:23:53.903 --> 02:23:54.003]  Yes.
[02:24:16.704 --> 02:24:18.284]  And the globalists are afraid of us.
[02:24:18.324 --> 02:24:20.025]  They're afraid we're going to use that strength.
[02:24:20.485 --> 02:24:21.625]  And you know what else, too?
[02:24:21.985 --> 02:24:24.806]  You know, you keep mentioning God, the Lord, you know?
[02:24:25.186 --> 02:24:26.106]  That's beautiful.
[02:24:26.306 --> 02:24:28.387]  I mean, that's beautiful.
[02:24:28.407 --> 02:24:41.890]  I mean, this time, you know, I'm just sitting here, you know, getting people together, you know, discussing what's going on and how can we make things better, make things right, you know?
[02:24:41.910 --> 02:24:43.611]  We're waiting, you know, also...
[02:24:44.269 --> 02:24:51.635]  For God and ourselves to stand up and say, you know, this ain't right, this is not right, you know, and what they're doing is wrong.
[02:24:51.855 --> 02:24:52.576]  And to say no.
[02:24:52.796 --> 02:24:53.456]  And to say no.
[02:24:53.476 --> 02:24:55.878]  And we don't agree with what's going on.
[02:24:55.958 --> 02:25:04.866]  And we know when things hit the fan, like, you know, what happened on 9-11, we knew, oh, okay, now they're starting this effect.
[02:25:05.426 --> 02:25:13.813]  So now that we're here in 2005 and people are now awakened, you know, with George So and George Norrie,
[02:25:14.403 --> 02:25:17.004]  You know, it's just powerful.
[02:25:17.084 --> 02:25:19.945]  And I love that show you did Tuesday night last week.
[02:25:20.065 --> 02:25:24.546]  I mean, you and Georgia know what is the solution.
[02:25:25.006 --> 02:25:26.347]  How can we expose?
[02:25:27.127 --> 02:25:27.467]  You know?
[02:25:28.007 --> 02:25:30.608]  And it's... We've got to do it.
[02:25:30.928 --> 02:25:31.809]  Good to hear from you.
[02:25:32.329 --> 02:25:32.889]  God bless you.
[02:25:32.909 --> 02:25:34.489]  I appreciate it.
[02:25:35.790 --> 02:25:37.510]  Number one, we've got to admit the horror.
[02:25:37.771 --> 02:25:39.071]  I mean, it's really hard to admit.
[02:25:39.131 --> 02:25:42.172]  Man, we've got psychopathic, really smart criminals...
[02:25:42.873 --> 02:25:48.656]  Who are using scientific systems to track and trace and control and manipulate us.
[02:25:48.716 --> 02:25:56.601]  I mean, but no matter how powerful their propaganda is and all the stuff they do, once we know about it, that is half the battle, folks.
[02:25:56.661 --> 02:25:58.362]  We have the intelligence to counter it.
[02:25:59.342 --> 02:26:02.924]  We're able to track their lies because we have millions of people that are out fighting it.
[02:26:03.505 --> 02:26:07.687]  The problem is we've got hate mongers who are there working for the government.
[02:26:08.323 --> 02:26:09.943]  Meant to make patriots look bad.
[02:26:09.963 --> 02:26:21.385]  We also have provocateurs out there to turn us against each other, to say, oh, the police state isn't as bad as they say, or this guy's bad, this person's good.
[02:26:21.405 --> 02:26:27.466]  You know, these so-called self-appointed gatekeepers in the left, the right, and the alternative media.
[02:26:28.867 --> 02:26:37.588]  But once you have discernment, I mean, once you get your mind in this, once you're really focused, once you're studying, you really will get discernment.
[02:26:38.522 --> 02:26:40.143]  And people are getting discernment.
[02:26:40.163 --> 02:26:41.824]  The attacks don't matter anymore.
[02:26:41.884 --> 02:26:44.425]  We just reach more people when they attack us.
[02:26:45.446 --> 02:26:47.867]  It's a sign that we're becoming more and more effective.
[02:26:48.427 --> 02:26:49.768]  James in Maryland.
[02:26:49.788 --> 02:26:50.548]  Go ahead, James.
[02:26:51.969 --> 02:26:52.389]  Hi, Alex.
[02:26:52.869 --> 02:27:00.753]  I was wondering if you could speak to the roadblocks that both Schwarzenegger and Bill Clinton face.
[02:27:01.694 --> 02:27:05.436]  Arnold, of course, to the presidency, and Bill to the...
[02:27:06.707 --> 02:27:08.589]  To the Secretary General's seat.
[02:27:10.390 --> 02:27:11.271]  And that's your question?
[02:27:11.671 --> 02:27:12.031]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:12.071 --> 02:27:18.216]  If you could speak to what they are and what those two men have been doing to take those roadblocks away.
[02:27:18.516 --> 02:27:20.158]  All right, I'll talk about it on the other side.
[02:27:20.218 --> 02:27:20.998]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:21.058 --> 02:27:24.621]  And we'll talk to Mark and Patrick, and that is it.
[02:27:24.661 --> 02:27:28.204]  I'm going to cover some more news in the last 25 minutes or so.
[02:27:28.944 --> 02:27:30.345]  Stay with us, presentplanet.tv.
[02:27:36.002 --> 02:27:36.942]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.383 --> 02:27:39.043]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.923 --> 02:27:42.724]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.886 --> 02:27:54.728]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:27:55.008 --> 02:27:57.349]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:27:57.609 --> 02:27:59.570]  Is your family safe right where you are?
[02:27:59.910 --> 02:28:05.272]  Only a personal radiation detector that's always with you and on can give you that instant assurance.
[02:28:05.652 --> 02:28:09.917]  The keychain-attachable nuke alert was specifically designed to meet this critical crisis need.
[02:28:10.377 --> 02:28:18.286]  Small, portable, and on 24 hours a day with its 10-year battery, the nuke alert is always with you to alert you to dangerous levels of radiation.
[02:28:18.486 --> 02:28:23.532]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[02:28:23.552 --> 02:28:25.554]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[02:28:26.054 --> 02:28:29.215]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.

[02:28:46.149 --> 02:28:46.769]  Hello, folks.
[02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:47.770]  Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.910 --> 02:28:52.013]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.153 --> 02:28:55.035]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.115 --> 02:29:01.840]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:02.000 --> 02:29:05.022]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.222 --> 02:29:07.603]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.723 --> 02:29:11.506]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites,
[02:29:16.229 --> 02:29:16.769]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:29:16.869 --> 02:29:17.889]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:29:45.769 --> 02:29:47.470]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:29:47.650 --> 02:29:49.651]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:29:49.851 --> 02:29:50.532]  Prepare yourself.
[02:29:50.712 --> 02:29:54.414]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.

[02:30:15.769 --> 02:30:17.130]  US Gold and Silver Coins.
[02:30:17.230 --> 02:30:18.351]  Tired of guessing what they are?
[02:30:18.491 --> 02:30:19.252]  Which are collectible?
[02:30:19.312 --> 02:30:20.052]  Which are bullion?
[02:30:20.112 --> 02:30:22.234]  Get your answers where the experts get theirs.

[02:30:25.336 --> 02:30:31.080]  As a special offer, Midas Resources will send you a 2005 Red Book and a genuine silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:30:31.120 --> 02:30:31.760]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:30:31.780 --> 02:30:32.981]  Learn what real money is.
[02:30:33.021 --> 02:30:33.582]  Feel real money.

[02:30:35.643 --> 02:30:35.943]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:31:04.812]  Well, what I've done is we did produce my own Arnold Schwarzenegger ad against him running for president, and that's aired in about four or five different areas of the country.
[02:31:05.673 --> 02:31:06.513]  Limited runs.
[02:31:07.754 --> 02:31:14.880]  And we also produced an audio ad that's on the... several different audio ads that are on the website, arnoldexposed.com.
[02:31:16.989 --> 02:31:20.592]  And, of course, the press totally ignored it, as we knew they would.
[02:31:20.672 --> 02:31:25.176]  I mean, the Amend for Arnold people run just a few ads in California.
[02:31:25.296 --> 02:31:28.619]  It was literally on every TV show for months, and still is.
[02:31:28.639 --> 02:31:37.486]  You know, how great it would be to amend for Arnold, with 80-plus percent of the population against it, depending on what poll you looked at a few months later.
[02:31:37.606 --> 02:31:39.767]  Oh, only 66 percent are against it now.
[02:31:41.309 --> 02:31:46.393]  But now his overall polls are so low, because everybody found out, contrary to being anti-
[02:31:47.145 --> 02:31:47.845]  Special interest.
[02:31:47.885 --> 02:31:49.186]  He's broken all records.
[02:31:49.246 --> 02:31:51.026]  He's involved in all sorts of scams.
[02:31:52.487 --> 02:31:55.868]  Doing all sorts of, you know, profit things for himself, being governor.
[02:31:57.428 --> 02:31:59.249]  I mean, the guy's a congenital liar.
[02:32:00.409 --> 02:32:02.770]  He's still a golden boy of the globalists.
[02:32:04.030 --> 02:32:10.692]  I think there's a good chance there's going to be some big terror event, or something burning, and he's going to save some kids.
[02:32:10.772 --> 02:32:12.593]  I really see that in the cards.
[02:32:13.206 --> 02:32:16.689]  You know, they're talking about Hillary in 08, which I think is a very good possibility.
[02:32:17.029 --> 02:32:22.113]  They're already running ads for Hillary to run.
[02:32:23.014 --> 02:32:24.435]  And that needs to be opposed.
[02:32:24.535 --> 02:32:30.820]  But, I mean, regardless, they're all... Frankly, a Hillary would be better than a Republican.
[02:32:31.581 --> 02:32:35.184]  I mean, if Hillary Clinton was in office, you think Republicans would put up with GATT?
[02:32:36.284 --> 02:32:40.448]  You think they'd put up with stuff like the Free Trade Area of the Americas?
[02:32:41.266 --> 02:32:42.488]  You think they'd put up with CAFTA?
[02:32:42.548 --> 02:32:46.593]  You think they'd put up with New Freedom Initiative for psychological testing and drugging?
[02:32:46.773 --> 02:32:48.755]  You think they'd put up with a real ID card?
[02:32:49.356 --> 02:32:50.938]  Man, no way, folks!
[02:32:51.639 --> 02:32:52.760]  No way!
[02:32:53.901 --> 02:33:00.730]  You think they'd put up with Clinton taking all transfer of technology restrictions off supercomputers?
[02:33:01.829 --> 02:33:05.431]  You think they put up with a $2.6 trillion budget?
[02:33:06.011 --> 02:33:10.072]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars?
[02:33:10.653 --> 02:33:12.373]  Bigger than Bill Clinton's biggest?
[02:33:13.634 --> 02:33:15.074]  I mean, I hate Hillary Clinton.
[02:33:15.115 --> 02:33:16.255]  I can't stand her.
[02:33:17.275 --> 02:33:18.596]  Now she's criticizing Bush.
[02:33:18.636 --> 02:33:20.077]  You leave the borders open, Bush!
[02:33:20.577 --> 02:33:23.418]  Bush, you're not, you know, she's trying to act more conservative than Bush.
[02:33:24.284 --> 02:33:25.865]  I welcome a Hillary Clinton.
[02:33:26.085 --> 02:33:26.645]  Let that.
[02:33:27.385 --> 02:33:28.445]  Let her get in office.
[02:33:28.586 --> 02:33:29.686]  Let her try stuff.
[02:33:30.286 --> 02:33:35.168]  She'll never get away with it, and then any Republicans that vote with her will be crucified.
[02:33:37.469 --> 02:33:38.589]  Can you imagine?
[02:33:38.609 --> 02:33:39.789]  No, no, no, no.
[02:33:40.290 --> 02:33:43.391]  I've looked at the historical line on this.
[02:33:44.151 --> 02:33:50.133]  More stuff happens in the last 50 years under Republicans than it does under Democrats.
[02:33:51.433 --> 02:33:52.914]  Republicans are worse.
[02:33:53.835 --> 02:33:56.877]  Not because of their rhetoric.
[02:33:56.897 --> 02:33:58.077]  Their rhetoric is better.
[02:33:59.258 --> 02:34:09.704]  But you want corporate welfare, bigger regular welfare, great society programs, and you want just gun control and open borders and U.N.
[02:34:09.724 --> 02:34:10.124]  treaties.
[02:34:10.505 --> 02:34:12.506]  Man, you get it under the RNC.
[02:34:14.387 --> 02:34:17.468]  And I've told Democrats, I'm like, you should love George Bush.
[02:34:17.609 --> 02:34:20.070]  Gun control, open borders, massive...
[02:34:21.068 --> 02:34:24.850]  Welfare programs doubling the size of every federal agency?
[02:34:26.772 --> 02:34:36.077]  You know, he'd abolish something like INS and then triple its funding, but the funding's for social engineering, less funding for actual people on the border.
[02:34:37.378 --> 02:34:42.021]  Doubling the size of the BATF, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
[02:34:42.041 --> 02:34:46.103]  Can you imagine the ATF if Clinton would have doubled it?
[02:34:46.464 --> 02:34:47.064]  Doubled it?
[02:34:50.060 --> 02:34:53.003]  And these idiots drive around with W stickers on their cars.
[02:34:53.023 --> 02:34:54.844]  They ought to have Chuckie Schumer stickers.
[02:34:55.244 --> 02:34:56.766]  I mean, he's more conservative than Bush.
[02:34:59.588 --> 02:35:01.009]  So it's all a big distraction.
[02:35:01.029 --> 02:35:03.011]  But Schwarzenegger's particularly dangerous.
[02:35:03.571 --> 02:35:07.074]  Why we largely sell those at him in the information war.
[02:35:07.134 --> 02:35:09.496]  We had test balloons going on Schwarzenegger.
[02:35:09.837 --> 02:35:16.302]  He's still a grave threat, but we've basically beat this groundhog back into his hole for a while.
[02:35:16.983 --> 02:35:18.244]  Smoked him into his hole.
[02:35:19.267 --> 02:35:26.389]  And he's still creeping around, but things aren't going well for him right now.
[02:35:26.449 --> 02:35:28.329]  But again, they could rehabilitate that overnight.
[02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:32.070]  It doesn't matter to the globalists if none of you want something.
[02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:35.671]  Again, if most of you are against something, they do it.
[02:35:35.751 --> 02:35:37.711]  So that's where it stands.
[02:35:37.751 --> 02:35:48.034]  Now, Bill Clinton, being Secretary General, they say that if you're part of the Security Council, that you cannot be a sitting...
[02:35:48.926 --> 02:35:49.126]  Excuse me.
[02:35:49.146 --> 02:35:49.246]  Early 07.
[02:35:49.286 --> 02:35:50.367]  And he could leave as early as mid-06.
[02:35:50.407 --> 02:35:51.688]  So he could leave in the next year.
[02:36:15.134 --> 02:36:15.814]  A year and a half.
[02:36:16.355 --> 02:36:18.416]  And, I mean, it's been in major newspapers.
[02:36:18.496 --> 02:36:19.556]  It's being discussed.
[02:36:19.636 --> 02:36:22.417]  I mean, Bill Clinton is lobbying for the job.
[02:36:23.058 --> 02:36:26.780]  And there's never a discussion about that restriction when that's happening.
[02:36:28.120 --> 02:36:28.981]  Then, of course, you've got what?
[02:36:29.021 --> 02:36:31.602]  Article 2, Clause 5 that bars Schwarzenegger.
[02:36:32.262 --> 02:36:33.903]  Most people think it's the 22nd Amendment.
[02:36:33.963 --> 02:36:34.183]  No.
[02:36:34.203 --> 02:36:38.845]  They're trying to overturn that, too, so Bush can serve three, four consecutive terms.
[02:36:39.425 --> 02:36:40.526]  A lot of stuff happening.
[02:36:41.619 --> 02:36:47.421]  There could easily be a con-con constitutional convention after the next terror attack and anything could happen.
[02:36:47.941 --> 02:36:50.642]  All right, let's take two final calls and we'll hit some other news items.
[02:36:51.222 --> 02:36:54.003]  Let's go ahead and talk to Mark in Michigan.
[02:36:54.023 --> 02:36:54.563]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:36:57.724 --> 02:36:58.764]  You got it, Mark, in Missouri.
[02:36:58.904 --> 02:36:59.964]  Okay, just go ahead, sir.
[02:37:00.545 --> 02:37:01.345]  How are you today, Alex?
[02:37:01.765 --> 02:37:02.365]  I'm fine.
[02:37:02.745 --> 02:37:08.247]  You're doing a great job and I wish the Lord's blessing on you to keep it up.
[02:37:09.159 --> 02:37:11.261]  And you've talked to me a couple of times.
[02:37:11.361 --> 02:37:14.123]  Got two or three things here real quick for you.
[02:37:15.283 --> 02:37:20.787]  Number one, I was just reading again a little bit through my Citizen's Rule book, the jury handbook.
[02:37:21.908 --> 02:37:27.752]  And there's a couple things that really jumped out at me as I began to run through that, read through that.
[02:37:28.453 --> 02:37:30.694]  And if people don't have that, they ought to get that.
[02:37:30.814 --> 02:37:35.678]  It's like 70 pages long, and you always learn something new.
[02:37:36.807 --> 02:37:39.528]  And by the way, I don't sell these, but the network does.
[02:37:40.608 --> 02:37:43.088]  And they sell them, folks.
[02:37:43.168 --> 02:37:47.529]  So call up and tell them you won at 800... What's the number to the network?
[02:37:47.549 --> 02:37:47.689]  800-686-2237.
[02:37:47.749 --> 02:37:52.990]  And you can call and ask for those citizen rule books.
[02:37:53.010 --> 02:37:53.430]  Go ahead.
[02:37:54.430 --> 02:37:57.571]  Yes, a line that really jumped out at me.
[02:37:57.791 --> 02:38:05.912]  It says, rather than giving up our rights, which is what we've been barked at that we ought to be doing, we should be giving up our wrongs.
[02:38:08.507 --> 02:38:13.351]  And if Americans would get back to that, we don't have to give up our rights.
[02:38:14.192 --> 02:38:21.118]  If we'd give up our wrongs where God could bless us again, well, then we wouldn't have to give up our rights.
[02:38:21.238 --> 02:38:27.624]  And when we're doing right, we have liberty and not tyranny.
[02:38:28.104 --> 02:38:34.530]  Well, how many passages are there in the Bible where there is liberty, there the Spirit of the Lord dwells,
[02:38:35.239 --> 02:38:36.439]  And there's so many of those quotes.
[02:38:36.499 --> 02:38:37.400]  It's common sense.
[02:38:37.940 --> 02:38:39.700]  I mean, if you're evil, you're going to be enslaved.
[02:38:39.720 --> 02:38:41.281]  I mean, it's simple.
[02:38:41.361 --> 02:38:42.601]  Actually, you had that backwards.
[02:38:43.241 --> 02:38:44.802]  Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
[02:38:44.822 --> 02:38:45.622]  There you have liberty.
[02:38:46.302 --> 02:38:48.023]  But I think it's the other way, too.
[02:38:48.063 --> 02:38:49.743]  There's like five of those, isn't there?
[02:38:50.424 --> 02:38:51.824]  I'm sure that there is, or more.
[02:38:52.864 --> 02:38:53.425]  Absolutely.
[02:38:55.365 --> 02:38:57.526]  And so that's where we are.
[02:38:58.587 --> 02:39:06.249]  Another quote that I'm sure all the listeners have heard in their life is all that's necessary for evil to conquer is that good men do nothing.
[02:39:06.809 --> 02:39:12.010]  We've got our pulpits full of good men doing nothing to fight all this evil.
[02:39:12.890 --> 02:39:15.031]  And so that leads me to a question.
[02:39:15.051 --> 02:39:18.611]  Yeah, imagine if your preacher got up and said, DynCorp's kidnapping children.
[02:39:19.672 --> 02:39:20.252]  It's admitted.
[02:39:20.952 --> 02:39:23.173]  I mean, that might scare my members.
[02:39:23.213 --> 02:39:24.293]  Well, they need to know.
[02:39:24.993 --> 02:39:25.193]  Right.
[02:39:26.297 --> 02:39:35.664]  The ones that are in the pulpit are supposed to be the watchmen on the wall letting us know, letting the people know when the enemy is coming.
[02:39:37.005 --> 02:39:39.327]  And so that leads me to a question.
[02:39:40.468 --> 02:39:52.457]  If all that's necessary for evil to conquer is that good men do nothing, the question is, when good men do nothing and allow evil to conquer, are they still good men?
[02:39:55.009 --> 02:39:56.090]  I don't think they are.
[02:39:56.110 --> 02:40:00.194]  I mean, people in their guts know stuff's wrong.
[02:40:00.634 --> 02:40:01.415]  People know.
[02:40:01.475 --> 02:40:02.396]  Everybody knows.
[02:40:03.256 --> 02:40:05.518]  There's no, I mean, you know, people really know.
[02:40:05.538 --> 02:40:07.420]  Folks know.
[02:40:07.440 --> 02:40:10.803]  I appreciate your call, my friend.
[02:40:11.724 --> 02:40:12.364]  Take care, Mark.
[02:40:12.384 --> 02:40:12.825]  Good points.
[02:40:13.165 --> 02:40:15.747]  Patrick in Kentucky, last caller.
[02:40:15.787 --> 02:40:17.189]  Go ahead.
[02:40:17.209 --> 02:40:17.629]  Yes, Alex?
[02:40:18.069 --> 02:40:18.370]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:18.550 --> 02:40:19.370]  Love your show.
[02:40:19.410 --> 02:40:19.911]  It's great.
[02:40:20.585 --> 02:40:21.366]  I watch it every day.
[02:40:21.426 --> 02:40:25.689]  I'm constantly posting articles on a website called Eat A People.
[02:40:26.050 --> 02:40:29.072]  You remind me so much of a friend of mine in Lexington that's so uncanny.
[02:40:29.672 --> 02:40:35.797]  I'm 37 years old and I've been victimized by this stuff for years, trying to get the mercury amalgams out of my mouth.
[02:40:36.257 --> 02:40:48.367]  I go to a website in Louisville to this doctor I'm going to and they've got this microchip that they can put in your teeth now to help you eat better or something.
[02:40:48.968 --> 02:40:50.910]  I'm like, what the heck is this all about?
[02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:51.491]  You're kidding.
[02:40:51.851 --> 02:40:52.552]  No, I'm not kidding.
[02:40:52.872 --> 02:40:53.793]  I'll send that to you.
[02:40:53.874 --> 02:40:54.875]  I've never heard of that, yeah.
[02:40:54.895 --> 02:40:55.696]  I'll send that to you.
[02:40:55.736 --> 02:40:56.536]  Well, I know.
[02:40:56.556 --> 02:41:01.602]  I read like five years ago Hollywood stars were having their kids microchipped in their teeth.
[02:41:01.702 --> 02:41:03.204]  And this was a mercury-free dentist.
[02:41:04.784 --> 02:41:08.025]  I mean, it was like on his website, the first thing I went to.
[02:41:08.085 --> 02:41:10.166]  It really freaked me out.
[02:41:10.206 --> 02:41:13.427]  Well, I mean, Tommy Thompson has left the federal government.
[02:41:13.467 --> 02:41:20.009]  He's traveling in a three-piece suit to hundreds of high schools and middle schools telling kids to take chips.
[02:41:20.169 --> 02:41:21.509]  That's a science fiction movie.
[02:41:21.829 --> 02:41:28.732]  Imagine ten years ago if I made a science fiction movie where members of the federal government were traveling around saying, take your chip.
[02:41:29.712 --> 02:41:29.912]  Yeah.
[02:41:30.672 --> 02:41:33.053]  I mean, we're living in fruitcake land here, folks.
[02:41:33.093 --> 02:41:33.293]  Yeah.
[02:41:33.772 --> 02:41:34.393]  Yeah.
[02:41:34.433 --> 02:41:35.293]  What else is on your mind?
[02:41:35.574 --> 02:41:42.920]  Well, I started out 15 years ago through finding out what's going on through Jonathan Vankin.
[02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:44.821]  I don't know if you've ever had him on your show.
[02:41:44.841 --> 02:41:45.542]  I don't know who that is.
[02:41:45.582 --> 02:41:49.285]  Conspiracies, Crowns, and Cover-Ups, a book that was published in 1990.
[02:41:49.585 --> 02:41:51.086]  You ought to have him on the show.
[02:41:51.707 --> 02:41:54.009]  Jonathan Vankin.
[02:41:54.249 --> 02:41:55.990]  He's written for several other newspapers.
[02:41:56.010 --> 02:41:56.251]  Great.
[02:41:56.411 --> 02:41:57.712]  What else is on your mind?
[02:41:57.792 --> 02:42:01.475]  Well, I was trying to find out more about you, and you
[02:42:02.116 --> 02:42:06.157]  You had admitted you were with the John Birch Society, and I didn't know a lot about that.
[02:42:06.537 --> 02:42:08.278]  I have not been with the John Birch Society.
[02:42:08.338 --> 02:42:08.898]  Oh, you haven't?
[02:42:08.918 --> 02:42:09.718]  I've never said that.
[02:42:09.898 --> 02:42:10.678]  Okay, okay.
[02:42:11.279 --> 02:42:13.439]  And I found some stuff on there.
[02:42:13.479 --> 02:42:17.940]  It was like a tinfoil hat, you know, bullcrap website.
[02:42:18.340 --> 02:42:20.241]  But basically, I was... I'm really confused now.
[02:42:20.601 --> 02:42:21.541]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:21.701 --> 02:42:23.142]  I wouldn't call them tinfoil hat.
[02:42:23.162 --> 02:42:24.642]  They talk about pretty serious issues.
[02:42:24.982 --> 02:42:25.582]  Right, right.
[02:42:25.663 --> 02:42:29.324]  Well, I knew it was somebody infiltrating.
[02:42:29.784 --> 02:42:30.964]  I knew that's what it was, but...
[02:42:31.528 --> 02:42:42.756]  Anyway, what I'm talking about, what I wanted to ask you was, what is your take on Ralph Nader and what exactly, what all do you have on Ralph Nader that's bad?
[02:42:43.897 --> 02:42:48.119]  And could you compare that to the candidate that you were for in 2004?
[02:42:48.440 --> 02:42:49.961]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[02:42:53.043 --> 02:42:54.664]  Okay, let me just stop it right there.
[02:42:55.661 --> 02:43:08.867]  I'm sure what you heard out of the corner of your ear and misinterpreted, my father in high school was involved with the John Birch Society and gave anti-communist speeches all over the state of Texas.
[02:43:10.327 --> 02:43:10.627]  Okay?
[02:43:11.568 --> 02:43:14.069]  And he hadn't been in the John Birch Society since he was in college.
[02:43:15.649 --> 02:43:16.770]  So, there's that.
[02:43:18.691 --> 02:43:20.211]  I'm not a member of the John Birch Society.
[02:43:20.251 --> 02:43:21.172]  I have friends that are.
[02:43:22.392 --> 02:43:22.672]  Okay?
[02:43:23.653 --> 02:43:23.813]  And I...
[02:43:24.471 --> 02:43:26.471]  I don't agree with everything they do and everything they say.
[02:43:26.491 --> 02:43:27.592]  They're a little too conservative.
[02:43:28.132 --> 02:43:29.112]  But that's okay.
[02:43:29.332 --> 02:43:30.152]  They're not the problem.
[02:43:31.453 --> 02:43:34.834]  Other than that, that's your... I'll clear that up for you.
[02:43:36.334 --> 02:43:40.615]  Then also, you were asking about Ralph Nader.
[02:43:40.655 --> 02:43:48.057]  I expose him in American Dictators, even though I introduced him in... I was asked to introduce Ralph Nader and give a speech, so I said, okay, I'll come do that.
[02:43:51.417 --> 02:43:53.458]  Ralph Nader's book was published by Rupert Murdoch.
[02:43:54.900 --> 02:44:02.982]  Ralph Nader, during the election, Ralph Nader, you know, definitely, but again, Kerry was controlled too.
[02:44:03.022 --> 02:44:05.283]  I mean, I don't know if Nader's controlled.
[02:44:05.603 --> 02:44:08.844]  I think he has a lot of good points he makes, and then he has some solutions I don't agree with.
[02:44:09.764 --> 02:44:12.345]  So by exposing him, we just ask the question in the film.
[02:44:12.365 --> 02:44:14.645]  I mean, that's really what I know about Ralph Nader.
[02:44:14.726 --> 02:44:16.646]  I hope that answers your question.
[02:44:16.706 --> 02:44:18.126]  Okay, we've got about 15 minutes left.
[02:44:18.146 --> 02:44:23.608]  A little bit less than that, and let me go over some of this.
[02:44:24.713 --> 02:44:25.574]  Here's an article.
[02:44:25.594 --> 02:44:30.236]  9-1-1 group says White House has not provided files.
[02:44:30.296 --> 02:44:33.758]  The Whitewash Commission is trying to act like they're independent.
[02:44:34.498 --> 02:44:36.159]  They always do this song and dance.
[02:44:36.640 --> 02:44:40.502]  So they're saying Bush won't release some of the documents that they wanted.
[02:44:41.062 --> 02:44:46.285]  Then, of course, all they called for is just an absolute total police state.
[02:44:47.620 --> 02:45:04.508]  The Gallup Poll Organization did a big national poll, and the majority of Americans are against giving up their liberty in the wake of the bus bombings, and they're against the warrantless checkpoints going on at bus terminals and train stations in New York and New Jersey and San Francisco.
[02:45:04.528 --> 02:45:09.850]  You can read all the details of the poll at prisonplanet.com.
[02:45:10.230 --> 02:45:16.473]  So that's just some, a very small portion of some of the news.
[02:45:17.151 --> 02:45:18.972]  Concerning that.
[02:45:19.012 --> 02:45:27.114]  And over here in this gigantic stack, piles are literally falling off the desk right now.
[02:45:27.154 --> 02:45:28.635]  I'm trying to grab them on the floor.
[02:45:29.195 --> 02:45:34.577]  EPA unions call for national fluoridated water moratorium.
[02:45:35.057 --> 02:45:36.057]  Coalition of U.S.
[02:45:36.117 --> 02:45:38.218]  Environmental Protection Agency unions.
[02:45:38.838 --> 02:45:41.299]  And it's all their major unions here unanimously.
[02:45:41.959 --> 02:45:45.380]  RE, bone cancer fluoridation cover-up.
[02:45:47.293 --> 02:45:52.057]  And our unions represent a substantial portion of the nationwide workforce at the U.S.
[02:45:52.077 --> 02:45:57.962]  Environmental Protection Agency, and we are writing, ask for a moratorium on the national program of the U.S.
[02:45:58.002 --> 02:46:01.685]  Public Health Service to fluoridate all of America's public water supplies.
[02:46:02.726 --> 02:46:10.472]  And they have all these doctors and scientists and Nobel Prize winners saying how deadly it is and how it's a toxic sedative and everything else.
[02:46:10.552 --> 02:46:14.755]  So there is that news for you, some good news there.
[02:46:17.071 --> 02:46:21.012]  We have kind of a roundup of news on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:46:21.032 --> 02:46:25.873]  7-7 bombings, final word, Her Majesty's Terrorist Network.
[02:46:26.493 --> 02:46:29.514]  Only conspiracy theorists would believe the government wasn't involved.
[02:46:30.474 --> 02:46:34.375]  And then we go through all the witnesses saying bombs on the bottom of the bus.
[02:46:35.315 --> 02:46:41.017]  An audio clip I never played of a London Guardian reporter saying that the bomb was under the bus, it was blown out.
[02:46:41.457 --> 02:46:42.877]  We'll play that clip tomorrow.
[02:46:44.901 --> 02:46:45.441]  Who knows?
[02:46:45.541 --> 02:46:53.607]  Maybe during this three-minute break you can go to prisonplanet.com, John, and they're on the main page and the general news down at the bottom.
[02:46:54.587 --> 02:46:58.050]  It's 7-7 Bombing's final word, or Majesty's Terrorist Network.
[02:46:58.730 --> 02:47:01.312]  Maybe you can scroll down to the first link.
[02:47:01.372 --> 02:47:02.873]  It says click here to hear the audio.
[02:47:02.933 --> 02:47:03.793]  Maybe we should play that.
[02:47:03.813 --> 02:47:04.434]  I don't know.
[02:47:04.454 --> 02:47:05.114]  We probably don't have time.
[02:47:05.134 --> 02:47:05.714]  We'll do it tomorrow.
[02:47:05.734 --> 02:47:06.435]  I forgot to do that.
[02:47:07.115 --> 02:47:14.240]  Again, ABC News anchorman Peter Jennings dies at 67 of lung cancer.
[02:47:16.397 --> 02:47:22.523]  And that goes together with all these big scientific reports about how mobile phones took your brain and your eyes.
[02:47:24.285 --> 02:47:26.467]  If you want to lose your vision, go ahead and keep using them.
[02:47:28.148 --> 02:47:30.491]  Watch for women and child bombers.
[02:47:31.848 --> 02:47:34.309]  says the Metropolitan Transportation Board.
[02:47:34.909 --> 02:47:39.490]  Terrorists could be preparing to use women and children as suicide bombers in further attacks on trains and other soft targets.
[02:47:39.830 --> 02:47:41.911]  In London, internal Scotland Yard documents warn.
[02:47:42.651 --> 02:47:46.632]  Ah, so the government may put a bomb on board with kids now, and we've got to search the five-year-olds.
[02:47:47.232 --> 02:47:51.073]  Official stop-and-search guidance just issued to thousands of Metropolitan Police officers.
[02:47:51.353 --> 02:47:52.234]  See, they profile there.
[02:47:53.214 --> 02:47:57.795]  Indicates the police fear the bombers may be planning to change their tactics or something.
[02:48:00.734 --> 02:48:01.675]  You mean the government, maybe?
[02:48:02.315 --> 02:48:05.197]  Hundreds more armed police to join London's terror fight.
[02:48:05.317 --> 02:48:06.238]  Oh, kill more people.
[02:48:07.599 --> 02:48:10.181]  Iraqi death squads execute American journalists.
[02:48:10.641 --> 02:48:11.682]  There's a bunch of L.A.
[02:48:11.722 --> 02:48:23.030]  Times, New York Times, two different articles where they just admit that American reporters go over there who aren't embedded and report on corruption, and our government, members of the Iraqi government, kill them.
[02:48:23.730 --> 02:48:25.051]  I mean, man.
[02:48:26.252 --> 02:48:27.053]  Pretty hardcore.
[02:48:28.194 --> 02:48:28.654]  And, uh,
[02:48:30.032 --> 02:48:31.714]  They said they would before the war even started.
[02:48:31.734 --> 02:48:33.395]  I don't know why it's a big mystery for people.
[02:48:34.777 --> 02:48:37.299]  And Blair's saying he doesn't want people to have any rights.
[02:48:37.379 --> 02:48:38.520]  No free speech, no nothing.
[02:48:39.201 --> 02:48:40.763]  That's what the bills actually say.
[02:48:41.503 --> 02:48:42.724]  I'll tell you about that when we get back.
[02:48:42.744 --> 02:48:43.125]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.084 --> 02:48:50.429]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.609 --> 02:48:55.053]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.194 --> 02:48:59.578]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.618 --> 02:49:00.960]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.742 --> 02:49:06.964]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:07.024 --> 02:49:13.947]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.087 --> 02:49:16.148]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.328 --> 02:49:26.794]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.094 --> 02:49:27.514]  If you want
[02:49:27.534 --> 02:49:27.914]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:27.954 --> 02:49:28.875]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:45.971 --> 02:49:51.196]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.336 --> 02:49:59.423]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.683 --> 02:50:06.729]  Medical Corps potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:06.869 --> 02:50:07.529]  We're good to go.
[02:50:34.088 --> 02:50:38.811]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:38.971 --> 02:50:41.693]  Call now and get free shipping.
[02:50:42.093 --> 02:50:43.534]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:50:43.735 --> 02:50:53.021]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:53.261 --> 02:50:55.522]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:55.703 --> 02:51:02.047]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[02:51:02.387 --> 02:51:03.028]  We're good to go.
[02:51:17.950 --> 02:51:18.450]  We're good to go.
[02:51:18.470 --> 02:51:18.771]  I think?
[02:51:55.920 --> 02:52:02.046]  Many of our forefathers left England to get away from not being able to speak out, not having free speech.
[02:52:03.287 --> 02:52:06.069]  And now they're banning free speech here, banning it over there.
[02:52:06.089 --> 02:52:10.033]  You know, restricting where you can have it on the street where news cameras will be.
[02:52:10.854 --> 02:52:12.716]  Arresting little old ladies with signs.
[02:52:13.837 --> 02:52:16.039]  Tony Blair's terrorism clampdown.
[02:52:16.099 --> 02:52:18.822]  More rules needed to control extreme websites.
[02:52:19.611 --> 02:52:24.052]  And then you tune into Fox News, and they're like, well, these are people saying, kill, kill Jews.
[02:52:25.472 --> 02:52:29.553]  And there are people over there saying that, and Fox News points out, they're left alone.
[02:52:29.893 --> 02:52:31.293]  It's been a safe haven for them.
[02:52:31.633 --> 02:52:32.754]  Yeah, because they're MI6.
[02:52:32.834 --> 02:52:37.495]  You know, Fox is admitting, so is CNN.
[02:52:37.775 --> 02:52:41.055]  Yes, it's a terrorist playground from all over the world.
[02:52:41.075 --> 02:52:42.196]  They all live in London.
[02:52:42.416 --> 02:52:43.656]  They've always lived there.
[02:52:43.696 --> 02:52:47.777]  That's how the empire manipulates and creates crises, of course.
[02:52:47.837 --> 02:52:49.157]  Again, they hide it all in plain view.
[02:52:50.649 --> 02:52:52.310]  And then they just came right out and admitted it.
[02:52:53.691 --> 02:52:57.955]  But see, the answer is, what Tony Blair wants to do is restricting some of this hate.
[02:52:59.416 --> 02:53:02.338]  Then you go find out what it is, and it restricts criticism of the government.
[02:53:03.079 --> 02:53:04.860]  And it's not going to be used against these people.
[02:53:05.440 --> 02:53:05.961]  That's why MI6...
[02:53:08.021 --> 02:53:11.122]  In Germany, it's been called founding the white supremacist groups.
[02:53:11.182 --> 02:53:13.704]  And then the leaders of the groups are MI6.
[02:53:14.024 --> 02:53:18.026]  And they go carry out bombings or beat a poor Turkish person to death.
[02:53:18.086 --> 02:53:20.487]  And then they take free speech rights away in Germany.
[02:53:20.647 --> 02:53:24.008]  Because look, the evil Nazis killed the Turk.
[02:53:24.348 --> 02:53:25.469]  Meanwhile, it's MI6.
[02:53:25.529 --> 02:53:26.950]  It's always the same.
[02:53:27.490 --> 02:53:29.090]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:53:30.711 --> 02:53:31.752]  But you watch our news.
[02:53:31.792 --> 02:53:32.752]  Well, this is good.
[02:53:32.812 --> 02:53:34.493]  We need stuff like that over here.
[02:53:36.522 --> 02:53:38.944]  But a man killed another in dispute over war.
[02:53:39.964 --> 02:53:42.106]  Press and police call it a first.
[02:53:42.526 --> 02:53:48.410]  They're at a flea market, and the witnesses admit that the pro-war guy starts arguing with the guy that's against the war.
[02:53:48.450 --> 02:53:49.591]  They start arguing.
[02:53:49.611 --> 02:53:52.373]  And at first we heard they both pulled guns.
[02:53:52.413 --> 02:53:54.114]  Now it's coming out that one guy pulled his.
[02:53:54.134 --> 02:53:55.034]  It's a gun show.
[02:53:55.595 --> 02:54:03.560]  Other guy pulls one, and then the guy shoots the guy who... But of course, the cops aren't charging the guy that pulled the gun and killed him.
[02:54:03.920 --> 02:54:06.282]  Oh, he was against the war, and he obviously deserved it.
[02:54:08.078 --> 02:54:11.580]  So now, you know, we're killing each other over this.
[02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:14.021]  Killing each other over this.
[02:54:17.282 --> 02:54:18.463]  It's amazing.
[02:54:18.703 --> 02:54:30.428]  Oh, and one guy was sitting there talking about how you get 18 people a day or something dying on the roads and the other guy's like, see, it's no big deal that the troops are dying.
[02:54:30.468 --> 02:54:32.829]  That's less than what died on the road.
[02:54:34.890 --> 02:54:35.050]  So...
[02:54:36.431 --> 02:54:38.072]  That's the type of stuff we're talking about.
[02:54:38.492 --> 02:54:39.113]  Hey, listen.
[02:54:39.293 --> 02:54:41.835]  Stop using mobile phones up against your head.
[02:54:42.055 --> 02:54:42.775]  I do it too.
[02:54:43.356 --> 02:54:46.298]  Get the wireless systems, or at least get the wire that plugs in.
[02:54:46.338 --> 02:54:49.259]  It still transmits some of it to your head, but not as much.
[02:54:50.640 --> 02:54:52.041]  Bunch of big studies out on that.
[02:54:52.562 --> 02:54:55.203]  More studies out on fluoride, just how deadly it is.
[02:54:55.584 --> 02:54:58.125]  Please find out what sodium and stannous fluoride does.
[02:54:59.546 --> 02:55:02.928]  Let's all start caring about ourselves and our children a little bit more.
[02:55:04.369 --> 02:55:05.010]  In closing...
[02:55:05.822 --> 02:55:06.622]  Get my films.
[02:55:07.163 --> 02:55:07.863]  Support us.
[02:55:07.923 --> 02:55:08.864]  Support what we're doing.
[02:55:09.184 --> 02:55:11.185]  We can do so much more when you do support us.
[02:55:12.066 --> 02:55:19.990]  The toll-free number to get Masters of Terror, Road to Tyranny, or Martial Law, or Matrix of Evil, or American Dictators.
[02:55:20.270 --> 02:55:22.992]  Got a whole book and video store on InfoWars.com.
[02:55:23.292 --> 02:55:23.672]  Go there.
