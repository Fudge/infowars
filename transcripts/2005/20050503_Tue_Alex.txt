[00:00:05.825 --> 00:00:06.466]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.146 --> 00:00:08.207]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:10.029]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:11.490]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.251 --> 00:00:14.152]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.172 --> 00:00:17.755]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.995 --> 00:00:22.059]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:35.754]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:38.055]  Here we are, another live edition.
[00:00:38.696 --> 00:00:41.817]  It is Tuesday, the third day of May 2005.
[00:00:42.398 --> 00:00:44.479]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:47.200]  We're going to be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.683]  Then I'm doing Jack Blood's show from two to four.
[00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:55.685]  Then I'm going to be on Jeff Rents' broadcast for two hours tonight.
[00:00:55.745 --> 00:00:56.966]  I have my own TV show.
[00:00:58.092 --> 00:01:01.236]  I'll be doing this evening for an hour and a couple of interviews on top of that.
[00:01:01.276 --> 00:01:03.259]  Hey, nine hours of broadcast.
[00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.342]  I'm looking forward to it.
[00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:10.548]  Fighting the globalists, getting involved, battling with the New World Order.
[00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:12.471]  24-7, that's our job.
[00:01:15.396 --> 00:01:17.178]  Big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:01:17.218 --> 00:01:19.020]  We have a couple mini-guests coming on.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:29.650]  I'm going to get some folks on from the Austin Toll Party because it's now coming out in the news about money laundering and scams and even more bribery and intimidation and infiltration.
[00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:39.240]  What the city, state, and feds are doing, trying to use Austin and Texas as the star in their crown to take over...
[00:01:40.089 --> 00:01:47.213]  The entire country and put toll roads on almost every existing road with transponders and satellite tracker boxes in our cars.
[00:01:49.495 --> 00:01:51.856]  And also, we've got William Gein coming on.
[00:01:51.896 --> 00:01:53.497]  We had him on briefly last week.
[00:01:53.817 --> 00:02:04.604]  He heads up the group that got the photo of the billboard that said that California is now Mexico, put up by one of the local TV stations via Clear Channel.
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.384]  And it's now been confirmed that there are a bunch of those billboards now that have been put up, at least seven of them, in Southern California.
[00:02:13.424 --> 00:02:15.906]  It's finally been on the local news, not on the national news.
[00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:27.973]  Free Republic, one of the neocon disinfo sites, with a lot of good people that are members, it used to be a pretty good organization, but it's been infiltrated, has been censoring out, posting the photos, and talking about it.
[00:02:27.993 --> 00:02:29.374]  They don't want conservatives to know.
[00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:30.995]  It's very important.
[00:02:32.614 --> 00:02:36.477]  But we have put it at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:02:37.077 --> 00:02:39.079]  We want you to know about the Lurie Conquista.
[00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.159]  We're going to discuss it.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.402]  We're not these anti-gun, pro-open border, neocon conservatives.
[00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:44.763]  Sorry.
[00:02:47.498 --> 00:02:58.580]  We do have Mr. Gein coming on, because somebody, some patriot, some freedom lover, somebody who loves this country, climbed up there with an American flag, and they were smart.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.021]  They didn't staple it or nail it and hurt the billboard so they could get charged with something.
[00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:16.203]  They simply took some long 2x4s and hung the flag between it so gravity would hold it flat and straight up against the billboard over the Mexico part.
[00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:22.611]  Because they crossed out California on the billboard and had it saying Mexico, Los Angeles, Mexico.
[00:03:22.951 --> 00:03:26.534]  Now it says Los Angeles and the American flag.
[00:03:26.734 --> 00:03:27.655]  I just love it.
[00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:32.679]  So he'll be on about 10-15 minutes with us as well to give us more details of this.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.984]  But I wouldn't just be covering this more than just a mention.
[00:03:39.645 --> 00:03:46.271]  I'd mention the flag being hung over, and I think it's great civil disobedience against this type of treasonous treachery by the establishment.
[00:03:47.111 --> 00:03:58.776]  I wouldn't be talking about it for more than a minute or two if there weren't other things involved, other things developing, like neocons trying to cover this up.
[00:04:01.297 --> 00:04:13.342]  Because a globalist can't win unless they have false conservatives that have infiltrated and that are suppressing the true magnitude of what we're dealing with and people who cover up for Lord Bush.
[00:04:14.402 --> 00:04:16.203]  Just like we didn't have the false conservatives
[00:04:17.214 --> 00:04:22.157]  Left gatekeepers making sure that the left never wakes up to 9-11 and the NWO.
[00:04:22.177 --> 00:04:28.702]  I mean, most of these guys are on the payroll of the Carnegie Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, and that's public knowledge.
[00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:30.984]  We'll be talking about that, by the way, later in the week.
[00:04:31.364 --> 00:04:32.785]  There is a ton of news.
[00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:37.549]  Speaking of the reconquista, big development I'll tell you about.
[00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:44.074]  Remember last Thursday, we had Terry Anderson on from L.A.? ?
[00:04:45.106 --> 00:04:51.110]  He said the evidence was clear that the MS-13 was ordering the murder of 400 black men.
[00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.872]  It's now in the New York Times.
[00:04:53.892 --> 00:04:54.932]  They're killing black men.
[00:04:54.952 --> 00:04:57.314]  And it's finally breaking nationally.
[00:05:01.356 --> 00:05:05.719]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:10.342]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.462 --> 00:05:11.283]  There is a chance.
[00:05:12.568 --> 00:05:14.850]  Use this disaster as a new world order.
[00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:17.772]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:05:18.013 --> 00:05:22.236]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.296 --> 00:05:29.242]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.362 --> 00:05:31.364]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.604 --> 00:05:42.166]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.326 --> 00:05:47.727]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.227 --> 00:05:50.867]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:50.967 --> 00:05:51.727]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.747 --> 00:05:52.148]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.168 --> 00:05:53.888]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:02.125 --> 00:06:06.627]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:06:06.967 --> 00:06:11.068]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:06:11.369 --> 00:06:11.889]  We listened.
[00:06:12.209 --> 00:06:17.191]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:17.951]  We listened.
[00:06:18.331 --> 00:06:21.372]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:06:21.812 --> 00:06:22.333]  We listened.
[00:06:22.793 --> 00:06:25.674]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and
[00:06:25.794 --> 00:06:29.415]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium.
[00:06:51.688 --> 00:06:55.611]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:55.631 --> 00:06:59.874]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.515 --> 00:07:08.481]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes, actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:07:08.881 --> 00:07:10.102]  It suppresses your immune system.
[00:07:10.342 --> 00:07:11.003]  Now check this out.
[00:07:11.383 --> 00:07:14.786]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:07:15.126 --> 00:07:16.207]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[00:07:17.768 --> 00:07:20.431]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[00:07:20.691 --> 00:07:21.472]  Your health suffers.
[00:07:21.732 --> 00:07:22.353]  It's that simple.
[00:07:22.693 --> 00:07:26.637]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[00:07:27.097 --> 00:07:35.025]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[00:07:35.465 --> 00:07:39.588]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.

[00:07:42.991 --> 00:07:43.491]  Agaricus Bio.

[00:07:44.852 --> 00:07:46.113]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:08:05.863 --> 00:08:06.505]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.188 --> 00:08:08.152]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.952 --> 00:08:10.033]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.693 --> 00:08:11.553]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.274 --> 00:08:13.194]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.574 --> 00:08:17.496]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.037 --> 00:08:22.159]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:22.999 --> 00:08:27.101]  All right, now into our second segment for Stations of Carry the News, our first segment.
[00:08:27.522 --> 00:08:29.543]  It is the third day of May 2005.
[00:08:29.663 --> 00:08:31.544]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:35.846]  We've got several great and important guests coming up today.
[00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:39.670]  And we're going to be taking your phone calls throughout the broadcast.
[00:08:39.730 --> 00:08:42.290]  A ton of vital news and information.
[00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:49.852]  Number one, I said I'd cover this yesterday because we just had the eve of the fall of southern Vietnam.
[00:08:50.192 --> 00:08:52.192]  We just had the anniversary of that.
[00:08:53.052 --> 00:08:56.033]  And I mentioned that I would cover this yesterday.
[00:08:56.113 --> 00:08:56.833]  I never did.
[00:08:56.893 --> 00:08:58.453]  So I will cover it in this hour.
[00:08:58.773 --> 00:09:03.694]  From News 8 Austin, Vietnamese war veteran recounts horrors of prison.
[00:09:04.435 --> 00:09:06.555]  Very important story and I want to cover it
[00:09:08.175 --> 00:09:12.218]  Continuing here, a new development that just came out.
[00:09:13.359 --> 00:09:17.442]  Clues sought in series of California highway shootings.
[00:09:18.864 --> 00:09:23.207]  And Terry Anderson, who's a syndicated radio talk show host, long-time activist.
[00:09:24.673 --> 00:09:44.538]  Black American who's been exposing the Little Reconquista, a virulent, vicious minority of Hispanics, predominantly leftist, Rockefeller Brothers and Carnegie Endowment funded in the 60s, that are going all over the country and the media is backing them up and protecting them.
[00:09:44.978 --> 00:09:56.504]  Trying to turn Hispanics basically into Ku Klux Klan members against blacks, whites, Asians, Jews, especially Jews, it's interesting, everybody else.
[00:09:57.645 --> 00:09:58.425]  Just amazing.
[00:09:58.465 --> 00:10:00.126]  But this group is protected.
[00:10:01.006 --> 00:10:04.228]  And in a lot of cases, it's interesting, they're even funded by Jewish groups.
[00:10:05.012 --> 00:10:08.374]  Really strange when you start studying it.
[00:10:08.414 --> 00:10:12.056]  But their website says they're going to kill the whites and take over.
[00:10:12.597 --> 00:10:13.377]  I've been at rallies.
[00:10:13.397 --> 00:10:17.100]  I've got video of other rallies where they have pictures of white people's heads cut off.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.521]  They say, we're going to kill you.
[00:10:18.801 --> 00:10:20.442]  They hand out flyers that say this.
[00:10:21.142 --> 00:10:22.323]  And this is going on.
[00:10:22.783 --> 00:10:24.004]  This is really happening.
[00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:26.471]  And our government is involved in it.
[00:10:26.531 --> 00:10:27.452]  Rick Perry's involved.
[00:10:27.492 --> 00:10:28.452]  George Bush is involved.
[00:10:28.492 --> 00:10:29.473]  Bill Clinton was involved.
[00:10:29.733 --> 00:10:30.834]  Hillary Clinton's involved.
[00:10:31.014 --> 00:10:32.215]  They're all involved.
[00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:35.757]  Fortune 500 are lavishly funding these groups.
[00:10:36.157 --> 00:10:36.557]  Why?
[00:10:38.378 --> 00:10:39.439]  Why is it going on?
[00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:47.564]  And the media's trying to empower these separatist, not even that, revolutionary groups.
[00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:52.092]  But the ADL and others just love them and give them all these awards.
[00:10:52.292 --> 00:10:53.133]  Literally, folks.
[00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:54.594]  I mean, I've gone to the meetings.
[00:10:54.714 --> 00:10:56.415]  I've sent others to get video of them.
[00:10:57.796 --> 00:11:05.240]  Our mayor, Gus Garcia, before the latest mayor, the latest creature who's just as bad, will win.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.341]  We have Gus Garcia.
[00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:07.321]  I've got the video.
[00:11:07.341 --> 00:11:08.422]  I've heard it on my TV show.
[00:11:08.762 --> 00:11:09.803]  I should post it on the web.
[00:11:09.843 --> 00:11:10.703]  I've got to dig it out.
[00:11:12.044 --> 00:11:14.826]  About three years ago, he had a proclamation.
[00:11:15.867 --> 00:11:17.948]  And they had Metra come up there to the podium.
[00:11:18.934 --> 00:11:30.078]  And Mutchett got up there to the podium, and he read this letter, how they were the mythical God race, the supreme race of the supreme beings, and how they were supreme.
[00:11:30.098 --> 00:11:38.481]  And then one of the other council members agreed.
[00:11:38.521 --> 00:11:42.183]  He said, yes, yes, my daughter is of the God race.
[00:11:42.223 --> 00:11:43.283]  She is supreme.
[00:11:44.063 --> 00:11:47.385]  You've got to have my daughter to know we are supreme.
[00:11:47.425 --> 00:11:48.145]  We are the best.
[00:11:49.037 --> 00:11:51.799]  And, I mean, we've heard this before.
[00:11:52.540 --> 00:11:55.802]  Some of the black separatist groups say they are the God race.
[00:11:57.323 --> 00:12:02.187]  Obviously, many of the white supremacist groups say they are the God race, the supreme race.
[00:12:03.168 --> 00:12:04.889]  I mean, it's the same story.
[00:12:05.049 --> 00:12:09.032]  But if a black group does it or a white group does it, the media says it's bad.
[00:12:10.034 --> 00:12:12.536]  I mean, I say it's those groups' rights to have those views.
[00:12:12.556 --> 00:12:13.596]  You know, it's a free country.
[00:12:14.757 --> 00:12:16.118]  I don't agree with those views.
[00:12:16.238 --> 00:12:21.521]  It's going to feed into the New World Order's paradigm of balkanization and control, but they're allowed to have those views.
[00:12:21.882 --> 00:12:25.484]  I say don't go arrest them, don't go surveil them, don't, you know, go harass them.
[00:12:26.304 --> 00:12:39.493]  But the Hispanic groups that are like this are the most powerful, the largest, the fastest growing, and man, they have got just carte blanche worship by this government because it's going to be used to break this country up.
[00:12:41.671 --> 00:12:58.228]  I mean, the same groups that support putting toll roads on every major road, the same groups that support forced inoculation, the same groups that support a national draft, the same groups that support the Patriot Act, the same groups that support all this evil support the open borders and the Lord of Conquista.
[00:12:59.429 --> 00:13:01.231]  We had Terry Anderson on last week.
[00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:15.133]  And he said, look, the Mexican gangs, we know they've issued openly the hundreds of thousands of dollars to kill border patrol and federal agents, and they have, final footnote in the news, you never have an America's Most Wanted about it.
[00:13:15.153 --> 00:13:16.393]  The average American isn't aware.
[00:13:16.693 --> 00:13:18.954]  American families are kidnapped, murdered, killed.
[00:13:19.294 --> 00:13:21.235]  Houses are shot up on a weekly basis.
[00:13:22.215 --> 00:13:25.416]  The Mexican people sneaking across are fed on by these individuals.
[00:13:25.937 --> 00:13:29.578]  Well, now MS-13 and others, Terry Anderson reported that he had this intel
[00:13:30.484 --> 00:13:32.646]  And they've had a bunch of black men killed on L.A.
[00:13:32.686 --> 00:13:38.473]  highways, just randomly blown away, that there's been an order to kill 400 black men.
[00:13:39.574 --> 00:13:45.160]  Strangely enough, the tip of the race war started by the Lorican Kistas is not even against whites.
[00:13:45.740 --> 00:13:49.704]  The particular hatred is for blacks and Native Americans.
[00:13:50.365 --> 00:13:51.106]  They really...
[00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:59.856]  I mean, it's even in major Mexican newspapers, calling Native Americans bad names, because they know they really have dibs on the Southwest, if anybody does.
[00:13:59.916 --> 00:14:02.797]  It's certainly not Aztecs from southern Mexico.
[00:14:03.717 --> 00:14:07.479]  People, you know, claiming it's some Aztec, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[00:14:07.519 --> 00:14:08.200]  It's asinine.
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:09.620]  It's boulder dash.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.161]  It's cockamamie.
[00:14:12.441 --> 00:14:13.522]  It's completely bunk.
[00:14:13.882 --> 00:14:14.582]  It's a fraud.
[00:14:14.642 --> 00:14:15.563]  I mean, it's just obvious.
[00:14:16.884 --> 00:14:18.604]  But, so he brings this out.
[00:14:19.805 --> 00:14:19.945]  And,
[00:14:20.672 --> 00:14:23.493]  I mean, I've talked to one of the, well, the head of the Border Patrol in Texas.
[00:14:23.513 --> 00:14:25.114]  He's retired now, but a few years ago he wasn't.
[00:14:25.134 --> 00:14:27.775]  He said, yeah, there's a $200,000 bounty on us.
[00:14:29.916 --> 00:14:33.018]  And they take pot shots at them all the time, and a lot of them have been killed.
[00:14:33.098 --> 00:14:35.659]  And again, it is in the local paper, and that's it.
[00:14:36.479 --> 00:14:37.040]  That's it.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.401]  You will never see it in the national news.
[00:14:40.801 --> 00:14:46.504]  What was it, about four years ago, they kidnapped two FBI agents at a railway station across the border of Mexicali.
[00:14:47.393 --> 00:14:50.035]  Here in the U.S., they were about to expose a major drug run.
[00:14:50.336 --> 00:14:52.477]  They took those men and they almost beat them to death.
[00:14:52.497 --> 00:14:54.399]  In fact, one of them is retarded today.
[00:14:55.039 --> 00:14:55.900]  He's in a wheelchair.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.242]  And you never heard about it.
[00:14:58.262 --> 00:14:59.963]  It was in a local paper in California.
[00:14:59.983 --> 00:15:01.764]  A few local papers, that was it.
[00:15:02.965 --> 00:15:05.127]  But blacks are really going to take the brunt of this.
[00:15:05.868 --> 00:15:11.472]  We've all got to come together, black, white, Hispanic, everybody, and see how we're being manipulated here.
[00:15:12.132 --> 00:15:15.315]  Clues sought in a series of California highway shootings.
[00:15:15.985 --> 00:15:29.955]  A spat of apparently randoms, this is the New York Times spinning, highway shootings in recent weeks has left at least four drivers dead and several more injured in Southern California and has prompted the authorities to increase undercover police patrols in the region's roadways.
[00:15:30.755 --> 00:15:38.981]  One person gets shot, you know, they've got this latest sniper shooting, and it's top news for months, but this is going on, oh, it's random!
[00:15:40.254 --> 00:15:44.738]  Authorities increase undercover police patrols on the region's roadways, the busiest in the world.
[00:15:45.179 --> 00:15:52.986]  Since early March, there have been at least seven shootings on highways in Los Angeles, Orange, and Riverside counties, three of them this past week alone.
[00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:55.520]  I'm told by my sources it's more like 20.
[00:15:56.341 --> 00:16:10.073]  Here in Los Angeles, where most of the shootings have occurred, a police spokesman, Sergeant Catherine Plowell, said Monday that a victim of the shooting early Sunday in San Fernando Valley described his assailants as a group of four or five young Hispanic men with shaved heads.
[00:16:11.815 --> 00:16:12.836]  That's the gang members.
[00:16:14.397 --> 00:16:21.083]  The description led detectives from the police department's gang unit to look into the possibility that the shooting was part of an initiation ritual.
[00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:31.676]  Sergeant Plow said that after being shot, the 19-year-old victim was able to get off the freeway and drive a few blocks before encountering paramedics who had responded to the unrelated accident.
[00:16:32.016 --> 00:16:36.337]  The man was treated at the scene and later taken to a hospital where he was expected to survive.
[00:16:38.878 --> 00:16:46.401]  And again, folks, we know the order's been put out to kill the Minutemen, to kill 400 blacks.
[00:16:46.481 --> 00:16:47.681]  We know that's gone out.
[00:16:49.813 --> 00:16:51.034]  Is that what's happening here?
[00:16:52.075 --> 00:17:05.365]  Folks, imagine being a white or black family, being in Arizona, and a group of illegals will pull cars up on both sides of you, pull you out, knock your teeth out at gunpoint, and rape your wife right in front of you.
[00:17:05.945 --> 00:17:07.827]  Makes a local newspaper, never the national news.
[00:17:07.847 --> 00:17:17.614]  Can you imagine if squads of white supremacists were running around machine gunning and killing federal officers and raping and burning houses down and slaughtering?
[00:17:17.654 --> 00:17:19.015]  It's just an orgy of death.
[00:17:21.049 --> 00:17:23.010]  These are hardcore criminals running this.
[00:17:23.051 --> 00:17:24.011]  These are the drug dealers.
[00:17:24.992 --> 00:17:26.533]  They do not want that border control.
[00:17:26.553 --> 00:17:27.793]  Neither does Lord Bush.
[00:17:30.055 --> 00:17:34.378]  Congress passed 2,000 more Border Patrol in the first National ID Card Bill of last year.
[00:17:34.458 --> 00:17:35.078]  They did pass.
[00:17:35.478 --> 00:17:41.062]  In areas he didn't like, which he helped get it passed by having some good stuff in it like Border Patrol, beefing it up a little, 2,000.
[00:17:41.122 --> 00:17:43.543]  That would just fill up the spaces that are missing.
[00:17:43.903 --> 00:17:48.026]  He then comes in and takes that out.
[00:17:49.952 --> 00:17:54.035]  But don't try to talk about that at the Free Republic website because they'll take your post down.
[00:17:55.356 --> 00:17:58.238]  Because they've got to keep you in the false paradigm.
[00:17:59.218 --> 00:18:01.480]  Let's go to Davey in Texas.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:02.320]  Davey, thanks for holding.
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:02.641]  Welcome.
[00:18:03.081 --> 00:18:04.282]  Hey, good afternoon, Alex.
[00:18:04.782 --> 00:18:11.527]  I just wanted to let you all know about Heather McDonald on C-SPAN this morning talking about the Patriot Act.
[00:18:12.047 --> 00:18:16.410]  She was on there representing the Manhattan Institute and apparently there's a hearing coming up
[00:18:17.031 --> 00:18:17.872]  In the near future.
[00:18:17.952 --> 00:18:20.796]  Might be today, even, on the Patriot Act.
[00:18:21.457 --> 00:18:23.961]  But she was lambasting you.
[00:18:24.281 --> 00:18:28.086]  She didn't specifically mention your name, but said that there was this campaign to...
[00:18:29.011 --> 00:18:30.752]  You know, I just want to thank you for putting
[00:18:50.771 --> 00:18:55.834]  You're life on the line every day and standing up for the truth and getting the truth out to the American people.
[00:18:55.854 --> 00:19:02.337]  Well, Davey, I want to thank you for calling, and I want to thank all those that have thrown the Patriot Act out and have taken action.
[00:19:02.657 --> 00:19:08.660]  You know, I had Ann Coulter on a couple years ago, and I said, Section 802 takes our freedoms and declares us all terrorists.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:12.642]  And she'd written a book about how the Patriot Act was good, and she said, well, I haven't read it.
[00:19:13.402 --> 00:19:15.364]  She hadn't read the Patriot Act.
[00:19:15.404 --> 00:19:18.466]  They're counting on people not looking at the subsections, Davey.
[00:19:20.247 --> 00:19:18.466]  213, 215.
[00:19:20.768 --> 00:19:23.189]  And Alex, you know another thing about her being on there?
[00:19:23.349 --> 00:19:32.856]  Not once did they mention the fact that this Patriot Act was passed in the aftermath of 9-1-1 and that not one member of Congress was allowed to even read it.
[00:19:33.297 --> 00:19:34.378]  Ron Paul's on record.
[00:19:34.398 --> 00:19:35.098]  That's on record.
[00:19:35.118 --> 00:19:35.538]  It's true.
[00:19:35.598 --> 00:19:36.819]  But Davey, it gets worse.
[00:19:36.859 --> 00:19:37.300]  Stay there.
[00:19:38.521 --> 00:19:40.502]  We'll talk about it more with you when we get back on the other side.
[00:19:41.203 --> 00:19:41.503]  Folks...
[00:19:44.085 --> 00:19:50.935]  They're using it against people that sell knock-off Rubik's Cubes, people that complain too much, topless bars, marijuana dealers.
[00:19:51.375 --> 00:19:52.757]  We have hundreds of these articles.
[00:19:53.338 --> 00:19:56.523]  And they go, nope, not being used against citizens, only being used for terror.
[00:19:57.083 --> 00:19:57.704]  Liars!
[00:19:57.804 --> 00:19:58.886]  You're the liars!
[00:20:01.778 --> 00:20:02.919]  Why do you wear watches?
[00:20:03.219 --> 00:20:05.781]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[00:20:06.262 --> 00:20:13.828]  At discountwatchstore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[00:20:14.208 --> 00:20:17.932]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[00:20:18.392 --> 00:20:20.654]  As an authorized dealer of many fine watches...

[00:23:00.945 --> 00:23:04.327]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.

[00:24:05.396 --> 00:24:06.997]  This show is documented.
[00:24:07.437 --> 00:24:12.801]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:12.941 --> 00:24:32.476]  I remember back in 2003, on January 8th, we got the January 6th Congressional Enrollment filing papers from the Library of Congress that showed that John Ashcroft's
[00:24:33.126 --> 00:24:37.928]  Deputy Attorney General had enrolled Patriot Act II.
[00:24:38.388 --> 00:24:41.449]  They had entered the bill through Dennis Haster.
[00:24:42.269 --> 00:24:46.771]  And we have that posted on Infowars.com in the Patriot Act, Patriot Act section.
[00:24:47.911 --> 00:24:53.333]  And then it showed up in a lot of alternative news, and then in the mainstream news, that Patriot Act II had been introduced.
[00:24:53.393 --> 00:25:00.255]  And John Ashcroft, about three or four months after that, got up in front of a joint session of Congress, joint committee,
[00:25:01.169 --> 00:25:13.431]  And he said, there is no Patriot Act II, there is no new anti-terror legislation, it is an urban legend, it is a lie, it is a conspiracy theory, those that are saying this are aiding Al-Qaeda.
[00:25:14.071 --> 00:25:17.292]  I have this in Police State 3 Tuttle and Slade, by the way, the actual hearing.
[00:25:17.752 --> 00:25:21.072]  They are aiding Al-Qaeda, and they will lose their liberty.
[00:25:22.773 --> 00:25:27.233]  And then, a couple months later, he goes, yes, pass Patriot Act II, pass it, pass it.
[00:25:27.633 --> 00:25:30.114]  Then they tried what they had originally built into Patriot Act I,
[00:25:31.186 --> 00:25:32.127]  Because I read the whole bill.
[00:25:32.587 --> 00:25:35.589]  I wrote the analysis of Patriot Act I, the first analysis out there.
[00:25:36.529 --> 00:25:47.876]  In Patriot Act I, if you read the sunset subsection, yeah, it's got some sunsets on little tertiary, you know, nothing filler in the bill, red herrings.
[00:25:49.377 --> 00:25:52.018]  And it sunsetted for 2005, end of 2005, for October of 2005.
[00:25:59.344 --> 00:26:06.190]  But then you look at the key provisions, 213, 215, 802, and a whole bunch of others.
[00:26:06.290 --> 00:26:07.451]  It's not sunsetted.
[00:26:07.852 --> 00:26:08.792]  They're in perpetuity.
[00:26:09.033 --> 00:26:15.278]  So it's built in so they can say, the terrorist threat doesn't expire on October 27, 2005.
[00:26:15.819 --> 00:26:21.223]  So we've got to reauthorize it.
[00:26:21.243 --> 00:26:25.287]  You notice Bush will say in some speeches, and expand it, and strengthen it.
[00:26:26.073 --> 00:26:28.054]  So, I mean, you all saw Ashcroft.
[00:26:28.074 --> 00:26:29.035]  You heard him all over TV.
[00:26:29.095 --> 00:26:30.555]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[00:26:31.316 --> 00:26:33.157]  The bill is introduced!
[00:26:33.397 --> 00:26:34.798]  He introduced it!
[00:26:35.358 --> 00:26:36.298]  They wrote it!
[00:26:37.219 --> 00:26:42.141]  And he's testifying, saying it doesn't exist, because they knew the committee wouldn't challenge him.
[00:26:43.922 --> 00:26:45.843]  They knew the dominant media wouldn't.
[00:26:45.863 --> 00:26:53.287]  It's like Rumsfeld saying, we know over a hundred times, we know where the weapons of mass destruction are, we know he has them 100%, we're going to get them.
[00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:57.557]  And then a few months after they don't find him, he says, well, I never said that.
[00:26:57.597 --> 00:26:58.458]  It's an urban legend.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:00.741]  Oh, he never?
[00:27:01.662 --> 00:27:04.346]  And then they put this lady on TV, and I got a few emails about it.
[00:27:04.666 --> 00:27:05.708]  We're liars!
[00:27:07.170 --> 00:27:13.753]  You know, I saw some other feds out there attacking me, and they go, Alex Jones doesn't talk about the controlled demolitions of the buildings.
[00:27:14.173 --> 00:27:16.034]  No, I've just made three films and written a book about it.
[00:27:16.374 --> 00:27:22.917]  I mean, the attacks they'll put on us are bold-faced, but they're counting on you not investigating.
[00:27:23.457 --> 00:27:25.378]  Go ahead, Davey, and finish up, sir.
[00:27:25.598 --> 00:27:34.382]  Yeah, I just want to let your listeners know, if anybody out there can turn on to C-SPAN 1 and start taping now, they're replaying this morning's issue of Washington Journal.
[00:27:34.998 --> 00:27:36.099]  On C-SPAN 1 right now.
[00:27:36.139 --> 00:27:37.640]  On Washington Whitewash?
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.461]  Yeah, Washington Whitewash.
[00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:48.067]  But you know, Alex, it's a great opportunity for the American people in the last couple of years since you've been harping on 9-1-1 and the inside job.
[00:27:49.958 --> 00:27:56.100]  There have been a lot of callers calling in, and they cut them off real quick and say, thanks for your call, and they never address the issues.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:58.081]  No, I know one of the few things I watch is C-SPAN.
[00:27:58.121 --> 00:28:00.622]  If it's some babbling idiot, they'll have them on three minutes.
[00:28:00.882 --> 00:28:03.823]  But some focused callers going at Infowars.com.
[00:28:03.843 --> 00:28:06.724]  They have the actual documents where Bush signed W-1-9-9-I.
[00:28:06.924 --> 00:28:09.385]  It was in the BBC ordering them not to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:28:09.525 --> 00:28:10.205]  Thank you, Click.
[00:28:10.325 --> 00:28:10.785]  Next call.
[00:28:10.985 --> 00:28:11.385]  Next call.
[00:28:11.465 --> 00:28:12.205]  Thanks for your call.
[00:28:12.646 --> 00:28:13.266]  Anyway, Alex.
[00:28:14.053 --> 00:28:16.196]  I just wanted to let your listeners know about that.
[00:28:16.236 --> 00:28:23.404]  If anybody out there can make a copy of this Washington Journal today with Heather MacDonald on there about Patriot Act, that's great.
[00:28:23.444 --> 00:28:25.407]  It'd be great for Alex to have that film.
[00:28:25.867 --> 00:28:32.315]  Number two, Alex, you know, I'm really morally outraged at the conviction of Lindy England and the sentencing that's
[00:28:34.106 --> 00:28:39.309]  Because she was ordered, and we have the memos ordering them to torture, so why don't their bosses get prison time?
[00:28:39.529 --> 00:28:46.973]  That's exactly my point, is if they haven't put one neocon on trial, whether it's Zach Heim or, you know...
[00:28:53.824 --> 00:29:00.809]  It's astonishing.
[00:29:00.889 --> 00:29:07.814]  It's shocking to the American people that these kinds of bald-faced lies are promoted as policy for this nation.
[00:29:07.874 --> 00:29:09.155]  It's just an outrage.
[00:29:09.175 --> 00:29:10.456]  But something's happening, Davey.
[00:29:10.496 --> 00:29:14.959]  People are checking out what we say and what they say and they're finding out who tells the truth.
[00:29:14.979 --> 00:29:16.600]  Yeah, who the liars really are.
[00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.680]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.142]  Read that Psalm 91 and stay strong.
[00:29:20.422 --> 00:29:20.662]  All right.
[00:29:20.702 --> 00:29:21.522]  Thank you, my friend.
[00:29:23.623 --> 00:29:32.568]  It does get a little scary sometimes when I'm being attacked by name by so many big mainstream media icons and publications.
[00:29:32.908 --> 00:29:38.371]  And then you know who the feds are, too, with the so-called patriots that are coming out of the woodwork to attack me.
[00:29:39.232 --> 00:29:40.352]  It's so obvious.
[00:29:40.912 --> 00:29:42.433]  And that tells me I'm doing my job.
[00:29:42.493 --> 00:29:45.735]  It tells me that I'm affecting change because of you.
[00:29:46.511 --> 00:29:49.432]  Because you're taking action because you're staying focused.
[00:29:51.874 --> 00:29:52.774]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.254 --> 00:29:54.855]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.776 --> 00:29:58.457]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:31:01.252 --> 00:31:09.518]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.779 --> 00:31:14.122]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.

[00:31:27.452 --> 00:31:32.498]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.779 --> 00:31:39.527]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:40.008 --> 00:31:40.548]  What about you?

[00:31:59.089 --> 00:32:07.434]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregosin, Oreganol, Oregomax, and the many underhealth products from North American Urban Spice.
[00:32:07.774 --> 00:32:08.975]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated...
[00:32:09.435 --> 00:32:20.043]  Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, in particular the P-7-3 oregano, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose with a 100% kill.

[00:32:53.649 --> 00:32:55.471]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents...
[00:33:08.766 --> 00:33:11.107]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:14.148 --> 00:33:21.171]  My lovely and intelligent wife, or as Jack McClam or Bo Grice would say, my bride.
[00:33:21.191 --> 00:33:22.592]  I love to say that.
[00:33:23.612 --> 00:33:30.935]  My bride, Violet, has been writing, I don't know, about ten articles a week.
[00:33:31.856 --> 00:33:37.098]  She's so upset about the New World Order that she's been, without me even asking her to, been writing these great articles.
[00:33:37.958 --> 00:34:00.765]  And she was spurred yesterday, we're going to go to your calls in a minute, by an article in Boing Boing, one of the big blogs, about how if you go to Disney World, or if you go to the Statue of Liberty, and now I'm hearing Independence Hall, or hundreds of health clubs, and tanning salons, I mean hundreds in Texas, but the article says hundreds, are making you thumb scan.
[00:34:01.786 --> 00:34:04.987]  When you go to the gym, or go to the grocery store, it's just all suddenly,
[00:34:05.683 --> 00:34:07.464]  And again, I've been talking about this since 97.
[00:34:07.524 --> 00:34:08.704]  I have the federal documents.
[00:34:08.724 --> 00:34:11.385]  They're going to make you do this with a new national sales tax.
[00:34:12.846 --> 00:34:14.127]  It's just going in everywhere.
[00:34:14.927 --> 00:34:23.130]  And so she wrote this big article with just scores of links and the footage where we tried to go to SeaWorld two years ago.
[00:34:24.391 --> 00:34:27.612]  And we didn't know that they put hand scanners in.
[00:34:28.893 --> 00:34:31.374]  And you walk up, and they just told us.
[00:34:31.394 --> 00:34:34.135]  They said, no hand scan, no go in the park.
[00:34:34.750 --> 00:34:41.513]  And I said, well, we're turning around, and we're getting our money back, because they don't tell you you pay, and then you go up there, and they try to make you hand-skin.
[00:34:41.533 --> 00:34:43.014]  And he said, just go on through.
[00:34:43.834 --> 00:34:47.196]  And I said, ma'am, and the video's on the website.
[00:34:48.856 --> 00:34:55.159]  I said, ma'am, what percentage of people are against this?
[00:34:55.179 --> 00:34:56.900]  And she said, turn your camera off, and I'll tell you.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.101]  And she said, the vast majority.
[00:34:59.761 --> 00:35:01.082]  People hate this.
[00:35:03.129 --> 00:35:09.154]  We had a caller a few weeks ago who took his son to Disneyland, Disney World, excuse me, Disneyland's in Los Angeles.
[00:35:09.715 --> 00:35:12.998]  Disney World is in Orlando.
[00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:28.011]  And he goes there, and they're retina scanning on top of the thumb scanning, and he says no and starts arguing, and then suddenly a bunch of people behind him go no, and then they just wave everybody through it.
[00:35:28.715 --> 00:35:31.777]  Until one person says no, everyone was looking upset.
[00:35:31.797 --> 00:35:34.758]  He said, and I saw the same thing, looking a little concerned.
[00:35:34.778 --> 00:35:35.599]  I don't like this.
[00:35:36.499 --> 00:35:39.041]  But as soon as somebody starts saying no, then everybody else said no.
[00:35:39.341 --> 00:35:40.282]  No one likes this.
[00:35:40.322 --> 00:35:43.223]  But see, folks, I have the federal documents.
[00:35:43.263 --> 00:35:44.184]  They're in the films.
[00:35:44.224 --> 00:35:44.784]  We've covered it.
[00:35:44.864 --> 00:35:48.486]  Rand Corporation, these other big foundations, they study this, how to control this.
[00:35:48.706 --> 00:35:49.587]  They brag about it.
[00:35:50.828 --> 00:35:54.930]  The trendiest nightclubs, the trendiest bars, the trendiest hotels.
[00:35:57.114 --> 00:36:05.599]  The places that the kids have got to go where you've just got to take that one trip or those two trips in your life to Disneyland or to wherever.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:11.403]  And I'll tell you, this weekend, we would have gone to Disneyland or something.
[00:36:11.423 --> 00:36:15.045]  I'd have flown out there with the family, but I'm not going to do it.
[00:36:15.765 --> 00:36:20.628]  Next weekend, I might have gone to San Antonio and gone to SeaWorld.
[00:36:21.068 --> 00:36:22.209]  I'm not going to SeaWorld.
[00:36:24.276 --> 00:36:25.957]  I've got so many tapes and so many videos.
[00:36:25.977 --> 00:36:32.079]  I've been digging around for the raw footage of that or for the edited tape itself because I want to re-air it.
[00:36:32.359 --> 00:36:33.299]  I've got so many tapes.
[00:36:33.319 --> 00:36:37.961]  I've got to get a bunch of interns in just to chronicle and go over all my videos.
[00:36:37.981 --> 00:36:45.204]  The problem is we try to get interns and they just want to hang around with boring Alex Jones and they find out how boring it is and they don't want to do it anymore.
[00:36:47.091 --> 00:36:48.551]  It's work, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:48.591 --> 00:36:54.372]  It's not... Literally, I have just boxes and boxes of video we've shot and things we've done that I want to get back up on the website.
[00:36:55.333 --> 00:36:56.933]  But, I mean, this video is on the site.
[00:36:56.953 --> 00:36:57.873]  I just want to find the original.
[00:36:57.893 --> 00:36:59.393]  I want to put it in a film or something.
[00:36:59.734 --> 00:37:03.594]  The point is I'm babbling and perseverating and talking about a hundred different issues.
[00:37:04.314 --> 00:37:09.676]  Not a stream of consciousness here on the air, but automatic talking.
[00:37:09.836 --> 00:37:12.676]  Sort of automatic writing or reading, as they call it.
[00:37:13.796 --> 00:37:16.697]  But, I mean, think about...
[00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:23.775]  She wrote this article, Conditioning for the Beast System, the Statue of Liberty, Illuminati icon.
[00:37:24.776 --> 00:37:26.717]  She's got all the links to these stories and articles.
[00:37:27.218 --> 00:37:30.380]  But think about how dastardly that is, how wicked that is.
[00:37:31.842 --> 00:37:35.385]  We try to go to the Statue of Liberty, or you try to...
[00:37:37.023 --> 00:37:41.588]  Go to Disneyland or Disney World or any of these big theme parks.
[00:37:41.628 --> 00:37:44.151]  Now I hear it's going to start going into Six Flags.
[00:37:44.231 --> 00:37:51.319]  It's gone into the Anheuser-Busch theme parks and SeaWorld that they also own.
[00:37:53.601 --> 00:37:57.946]  And you go to these places and your children and you are conditioned to accept it.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:07.727]  It has nothing to do with making sure you don't cheat and use somebody else's ID to get in as they claim.
[00:38:10.129 --> 00:38:11.871]  Because the photo IDs do that.
[00:38:12.972 --> 00:38:15.334]  It is all part of this program of control.
[00:38:15.794 --> 00:38:20.358]  And the feds are going to use it where you have to swipe your federalized state ID card
[00:38:21.329 --> 00:38:31.456]  Standardized through the terminal, wherever you go, riding a bus, buying a cheeseburger, going to the grocery store, going to the gym, you name it.
[00:38:32.357 --> 00:38:37.921]  Federal control over every terminal, every cash register, every business, and it's going to be graduated.
[00:38:39.042 --> 00:38:44.065]  This is the official plans, because it's, quote, got to be fair, and so that's the excuse.
[00:38:44.125 --> 00:38:46.787]  Well, I'm only in a 10% sales bracket, sales tax.
[00:38:46.807 --> 00:38:47.227]  Well, I'm in a 17%.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:59.302]  Well, I'm paying my fair share, but to make sure, I've got to swipe my card, and to make sure it's not stolen, or to stop people from loaning their cards to others, which will be a big problem, of course.
[00:38:59.342 --> 00:39:10.865]  They love the problems their systems create, and that's the excuse to police and scan and track how much you buy and what you do, while you're using too much for what your household says it consumes, and how much money you make.
[00:39:11.105 --> 00:39:13.726]  You're buying for someone else to cheat the system.
[00:39:14.646 --> 00:39:15.626]  It's all going to happen.
[00:39:16.166 --> 00:39:18.227]  They work all this out beforehand.
[00:39:18.809 --> 00:39:20.775]  And you're going to have to thumbprint to make sure!
[00:39:22.842 --> 00:39:26.172]  And thousands of school districts, thousands!
[00:39:29.136 --> 00:39:36.919]  Thousands of school districts now, no cash allowed, no meal ticket allowed, can't bring your cash in or your check in and buy the meal ticket.
[00:39:37.419 --> 00:39:45.263]  Because, you know, the reason for meal tickets was, well, bullies take the lunch money, but if your parents buy you a month meal ticket, they just punch holes in it.
[00:39:45.823 --> 00:39:47.363]  But bullies can take that, too.
[00:39:47.623 --> 00:39:55.567]  So we've got to thumb scan you, and to get a library book, we've got to thumb scan you, and there's a transponder in it, too, and Europe's doing it, we're doing it.
[00:39:57.207 --> 00:39:58.628]  Tune in to Children's TV.
[00:40:01.818 --> 00:40:06.100]  Almost every show I see, they're thumb scanning, they're retina scanning, they're DNA testing to buy and sell.
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:07.320]  It's in all the shows.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:07.720]  Why?
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.341]  It's mass conditioning.
[00:40:10.902 --> 00:40:16.544]  ABC's got a big miniseries coming out about the terrorist attacks of 93, 95, and 2001.
[00:40:16.644 --> 00:40:20.265]  Oh, it's sick.
[00:40:20.365 --> 00:40:22.026]  It's just everything is propaganda.
[00:40:24.127 --> 00:40:26.908]  So I hope that folks will start checking Infowars.com out.
[00:40:28.345 --> 00:40:32.409]  For all of these original articles and analysis that my wife has been putting together.
[00:40:32.909 --> 00:40:39.356]  And, of course, presentplanet.com, the webmaster over there is Paul Watson, doing an absolutely fabulous job.
[00:40:40.297 --> 00:40:48.925]  And then his brother is over there as well, the other Mr. Watson, at infowars.net, doing a great job.
[00:40:48.945 --> 00:40:52.829]  Then we have Ryan Slickheisen.
[00:40:53.907 --> 00:40:58.470]  Who doubles up on Infowars.com and also works on PrisonPlanet.tv with Paul.
[00:40:59.210 --> 00:41:01.692]  So those are my four webmasters.
[00:41:04.254 --> 00:41:16.101]  They do the work of ten people, and I just want to commend them for their thought, their forethought, their analysis, their love of liberty and freedom, and the great job they're doing.
[00:41:17.902 --> 00:41:19.623]  And when you get my films...
[00:41:20.592 --> 00:41:21.873]  Number one, it wakes people up.
[00:41:21.933 --> 00:41:22.594]  They're powerful.
[00:41:22.634 --> 00:41:23.434]  They're hardcore.
[00:41:23.474 --> 00:41:24.535]  They're affecting change.
[00:41:24.695 --> 00:41:27.818]  That's why I want you to make copies of them so they will have an effect.
[00:41:27.858 --> 00:41:28.898]  That's what the real power is.
[00:41:29.219 --> 00:41:37.945]  But number two, it makes this operation possible where we spend 95% of what comes in on battling the New World Order.
[00:41:40.047 --> 00:41:50.055]  And the other 5% goes so a couple times a year I can go rent a little condominium on the beach for two days and hang out with my family and
[00:41:51.469 --> 00:41:54.873]  So I can put food in the refrigerator.
[00:41:54.893 --> 00:41:57.595]  But you know no one works harder than we do, folks.
[00:41:58.877 --> 00:41:59.317]  18 hours a day.
[00:41:59.357 --> 00:42:00.678]  I'll be working 18 hours a day.
[00:42:00.698 --> 00:42:01.679]  I haven't been doing that lately.
[00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:03.441]  I've backed off to 10, 12 hours a day.
[00:42:03.481 --> 00:42:06.384]  But I'll be doing an 18-hour day-to-day, 9 hours on air.
[00:42:07.645 --> 00:42:10.548]  And I'm not asking you to work that hard, but I am asking you to support us.
[00:42:11.787 --> 00:42:17.210]  I am asking you to do that because I know we can defeat the New World Order with God's help, but you have to take action.
[00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:18.371]  All right, that's enough.
[00:42:18.671 --> 00:42:30.697]  I just wanted to mention that my wife did a great job analyzing these biometrics, and I'm going to read not her article, but one of the articles she linked to, the Boing Boing article that goes into all of this.
[00:42:30.717 --> 00:42:32.258]  And, hey, better late than never.
[00:42:32.298 --> 00:42:34.980]  I'm glad people are finally seeing the grid go into place.
[00:42:38.599 --> 00:42:43.023]  And I hope some of the callers want to talk about Mexican gangs targeting and killing black men.
[00:42:43.083 --> 00:42:44.084]  It's now in the New York Times.
[00:42:44.444 --> 00:42:46.125]  You heard it here last week from Terry Anderson.
[00:42:47.346 --> 00:42:52.551]  I mean, these are racially motivated hate killings, and the media is trying to cover it up.
[00:42:52.611 --> 00:42:53.391]  It's finally coming out.
[00:42:53.592 --> 00:42:54.292]  They can't ignore it.
[00:42:56.174 --> 00:43:03.180]  And we need to expose the Lorican cases, and we need to expose why is the Republican and Democratic parties funding them?
[00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:05.341]  Because it's part of the New World Order plan.
[00:43:05.361 --> 00:43:07.203]  All right, I'm going faster calls now.
[00:43:08.061 --> 00:43:09.022]  Sorry, I kept everybody holding.
[00:43:09.382 --> 00:43:10.242]  Allen in Connecticut.
[00:43:10.262 --> 00:43:10.883]  Go ahead, Allen.
[00:43:10.903 --> 00:43:12.124]  Hi, Alex.
[00:43:12.204 --> 00:43:13.985]  It's such an honor to be speaking with you today.
[00:43:14.185 --> 00:43:15.326]  No, it's an honor to be talking to you.
[00:43:15.346 --> 00:43:15.686]  Go ahead.
[00:43:17.207 --> 00:43:19.689]  I saw something special on the History Channel the other day.
[00:43:19.709 --> 00:43:22.530]  It took you behind the scenes of the Pentagon.
[00:43:23.831 --> 00:43:32.477]  One thing that I wasn't aware of, and I didn't hear about it in your videos, is that September 11, 1941... It's when they started construction.
[00:43:33.098 --> 00:43:33.458]  Right.
[00:43:33.498 --> 00:43:39.861]  I just found that ironic that 60 years later, exactly to this day, it has a plain, quote-unquote, go through it.
[00:43:40.261 --> 00:43:47.244]  Well, I've been sent emails saying I'm wrong, but I've read it in about, I don't know, four or five different architectural journals.
[00:43:47.984 --> 00:43:49.085]  I've seen it on TV.
[00:43:49.105 --> 00:43:50.305]  I don't watch much TV.
[00:43:51.286 --> 00:43:56.928]  They started the construction of the World Trade Centers on September 11th.
[00:43:57.848 --> 00:44:01.950]  And then I get emails saying that's not true, but that's what the architectural reports say.
[00:44:03.211 --> 00:44:08.555]  I went right to their website, the Pentagon website, and it says right on there, you know, we broke ground September 11th.
[00:44:08.635 --> 00:44:10.216]  So I don't understand that.
[00:44:10.236 --> 00:44:14.920]  And the Chicago Mercantile on the one-year anniversary was 9-11-point-0-0-0-0.
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.381]  And I'll repeat this, but it's important.
[00:44:16.701 --> 00:44:18.743]  The New York Lottery came up 9-1-1.
[00:44:19.564 --> 00:44:23.747]  They made all these TV shows and movies about the government flying jets into the buildings.
[00:44:24.147 --> 00:44:30.352]  It's the globalists, again, their religion they're part of is based on the ancient construction guilds.
[00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:36.863]  That built the temples in Egypt and Babylon, and then Solomon's Temple, and then on through today.
[00:44:36.943 --> 00:44:43.987]  So their religious sacrament is numbers and architecture, and mass war and sacrifice.
[00:44:44.047 --> 00:44:45.107]  That's the three components.
[00:44:46.348 --> 00:44:49.790]  And a ruthfulness, an enjoyment in being ruthless.
[00:44:55.483 --> 00:44:56.624]  A new term, I guess I've coined.
[00:44:57.165 --> 00:45:04.051]  And so, that's what we're dealing with, and this is their religion, and like all other psychopathic killers, they leave calling cards.
[00:45:04.091 --> 00:45:04.712]  Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:45:06.153 --> 00:45:13.419]  I just also wanted to ask you, too, if there have been any new leads in the mysterious deaths of the microbiologists, and how many is it up to now?
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.322]  Well, on the more liberal list, it's over 150.
[00:45:16.722 --> 00:45:18.364]  Conservative list, it's like 80-something.
[00:45:19.571 --> 00:45:24.054]  And they have their hearts cut out, their intestines strung all over the place, and pentagrams carved on their backs.
[00:45:24.395 --> 00:45:27.557]  They're run over, they're machine gunned, they're drowned, they're tortured to death.
[00:45:28.397 --> 00:45:31.019]  Washington Post, folks, they have their guts and hearts cut out.
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.522]  And they're just, you know, it's no big deal.
[00:45:34.542 --> 00:45:35.182]  Just don't worry about it.
[00:45:37.604 --> 00:45:41.467]  I can't believe that nobody... You're the only source that I can...
[00:45:42.202 --> 00:45:48.206]  Get reliable news information, which is why I've given up my cable TV entirely.
[00:45:48.446 --> 00:45:50.147]  Well, actually, let me be honest with you.
[00:45:50.287 --> 00:45:51.027]  I'm not doing it.
[00:45:51.488 --> 00:45:52.768]  I'm a very small part of this.
[00:45:53.629 --> 00:46:06.077]  What I do, and what I've taught others to do, and people inherently that I've hired that secretly knew how to do it, is what we do, my little team, is we read the thousands of emails and news links you send us.
[00:46:06.157 --> 00:46:09.419]  So, number one, we have this great intelligence group out there that's you, sir.
[00:46:09.519 --> 00:46:09.739]  You.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:11.620]  People like you.
[00:46:12.515 --> 00:46:22.822]  Then, all five of us sit there reading and scanning, so a lot of this is in the mainstream news, but it never gets out of the news wires, or it never gets out of a regional newspaper, or a local paper.
[00:46:23.082 --> 00:46:25.904]  The gatekeepers at the national level decide what gets through.
[00:46:25.964 --> 00:46:27.645]  We break that monopoly.
[00:46:27.685 --> 00:46:28.486]  That's all we do.
[00:46:30.207 --> 00:46:32.328]  And something you can do, something you can duplicate.
[00:46:33.289 --> 00:46:34.530]  I want other people to do this.
[00:46:34.590 --> 00:46:36.551]  I want other people to be more successful than we've been.
[00:46:37.191 --> 00:46:41.054]  The answer, the solution, is taking action, not infighting,
[00:46:41.952 --> 00:46:46.557]  And that means, by the way, staying away from people that do infight, and moving forward.
[00:46:47.258 --> 00:46:47.818]  Anything else?
[00:46:47.838 --> 00:47:01.713]  I also read somewhere that one of the lawyers that helped Prescott Bush hide all of his Nazi money that he was laundering was Alan Dulles, who was the Chief Director of the CIA.
[00:47:01.953 --> 00:47:02.474]  And his brother.
[00:47:04.347 --> 00:47:08.029]  I went to double-check on the fact online.
[00:47:08.169 --> 00:47:10.191]  It just seems so unbelievable.
[00:47:10.651 --> 00:47:13.372]  And it's just amazing how deep this thing really is.
[00:47:13.913 --> 00:47:15.834]  It's all in martial law.
[00:47:15.874 --> 00:47:21.917]  I mean, we have the 1942 major New York papers with Prescott Bush's name in them.
[00:47:22.678 --> 00:47:26.000]  And up until 1951, they were taking the Nazi money out.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.942]  That's why they're such a powerful crime family now.
[00:47:30.683 --> 00:47:30.963]  Well, I...
[00:47:31.656 --> 00:47:36.278]  I thank you so much for taking my call, Alex, and I wish you the best of luck, and just keep doing what you're doing.
[00:47:36.298 --> 00:47:37.399]  We really love you out here.
[00:47:37.939 --> 00:47:40.640]  Well, I love you guys, and I appreciate you.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.061]  And listen, life is a wonderful, beautiful thing.
[00:47:43.081 --> 00:47:45.002]  I mean, I just love life so much.
[00:47:45.042 --> 00:47:48.244]  I love the beauty of the sunset or the night sky.
[00:47:48.344 --> 00:47:49.244]  I just love life.
[00:47:50.285 --> 00:47:51.925]  And, you know, there's a good chance.
[00:47:51.945 --> 00:47:55.267]  I mean, it's all in God's hands, but the globalists will kill me.
[00:47:56.778 --> 00:48:00.382]  I don't know when or how, and I'm still on record.
[00:48:00.462 --> 00:48:01.343]  I'm not suicidal.
[00:48:01.383 --> 00:48:02.104]  I'd never do that.
[00:48:03.445 --> 00:48:05.868]  But the answer is more of us taking action.
[00:48:05.888 --> 00:48:07.649]  There's so many targets, there's nothing they can do.
[00:48:08.110 --> 00:48:09.071]  They can try to demonize us.
[00:48:09.451 --> 00:48:15.838]  But if they ever do kill me, when they really try to demonize me after they kill me, just know it's all lies, and please defend me.
[00:48:16.482 --> 00:48:23.445]  Because I've thought about things like this, and it's a little selfish for me to talk about this on air, but it's the thoughts I've had.
[00:48:24.506 --> 00:48:39.313]  That's one of the few regrets I'll have if they do get rid of me, is that I won't get to enjoy life and my family, and I won't get to be here anymore and expose the New World Order and stand up against things and come up with ideas and be able to talk to you.
[00:48:40.693 --> 00:48:42.354]  But it is a good price to pay.
[00:48:43.486 --> 00:48:47.749]  Because, I mean, I can't commit my family and this culture and everything to total slavery.
[00:48:48.029 --> 00:48:49.230]  We know we're dealing with pure evil.
[00:48:49.570 --> 00:48:50.551]  We've got to fight it.
[00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:53.333]  By going along with it, we ensure our destruction.
[00:48:53.693 --> 00:48:58.677]  It's safer to fight this and to go 100% than to just go along with it.
[00:49:02.919 --> 00:49:06.382]  Again, I'll probably be here for another 50 years, but it doesn't matter.
[00:49:06.482 --> 00:49:09.584]  So many of you are afraid to take action because you're afraid the new order will get you.
[00:49:10.778 --> 00:49:12.719]  Folks, I'm a canary in the coal mine for all of you.
[00:49:12.779 --> 00:49:14.680]  I mean, there's so many prominent people that have fallen.
[00:49:15.860 --> 00:49:17.481]  But again, it's all in God's hands.
[00:49:18.462 --> 00:49:19.342]  Let's take another call.
[00:49:19.902 --> 00:49:21.143]  I get that question all the time.
[00:49:21.963 --> 00:49:24.584]  Let's go ahead and talk to another caller from Connecticut.
[00:49:24.684 --> 00:49:25.425]  Eric, go ahead.
[00:49:25.685 --> 00:49:26.065]  Hey, Alex.
[00:49:26.125 --> 00:49:30.547]  Well, it's great to know that there are cellmates here in Bill Z. Bub's boardroom besides myself.
[00:49:31.147 --> 00:49:31.587]  That's right.
[00:49:31.627 --> 00:49:32.448]  Good old Connecticut.
[00:49:32.668 --> 00:49:34.148]  Yeah.
[00:49:35.909 --> 00:49:38.390]  I sent you an email a while ago about Ms.
[00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.811]  Ann Coulter, the Coulter Beast.
[00:49:40.652 --> 00:49:43.714]  And I noticed that she was recently on the cover of Time.
[00:49:43.774 --> 00:49:46.135]  Yeah, they're out promoting her in the name of demonizing her.
[00:49:46.615 --> 00:49:50.397]  Yeah, it's funny because she was denying all that stuff about Prescott Bush.
[00:49:51.157 --> 00:49:52.278]  And you did the interview with her.
[00:49:52.778 --> 00:50:00.742]  But on tbrnews.org, there's an unconfirmed rumor that she was once a he.
[00:50:02.323 --> 00:50:06.025]  That Ann Coulter is formerly an Arthur Coltrane.
[00:50:07.501 --> 00:50:10.604]  Of a southern pig farming family.
[00:50:12.325 --> 00:50:15.007]  And that basically she had an operation.
[00:50:16.128 --> 00:50:17.529]  Well, I don't know that.
[00:50:18.170 --> 00:50:21.452]  Listen, that's probably not true, sir.
[00:50:22.233 --> 00:50:22.973]  Maybe, maybe not.
[00:50:23.734 --> 00:50:26.136]  I mean, it certainly sounds off the wall.
[00:50:26.216 --> 00:50:27.237]  No doubt about that, Alex.
[00:50:28.098 --> 00:50:29.239]  Yeah.
[00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:32.500]  What I know is she is a demon, and she's the ugliest woman I've ever seen.
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:33.840]  Yeah.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:36.281]  I saw her in person, and I literally was taken aback.
[00:50:36.421 --> 00:50:38.042]  Folks, I'm not just saying this.
[00:50:38.662 --> 00:50:39.803]  I'll tell the story when we get back.
[00:50:40.203 --> 00:50:44.405]  I mean, I actually... She could be the star of a Day of the Dead movie.
[00:50:44.925 --> 00:50:45.585]  One of the zombies.
[00:50:45.725 --> 00:50:48.106]  I mean, she is... It was terrifying.
[00:50:48.286 --> 00:50:49.767]  I mean, I actually took a step back.
[00:50:50.627 --> 00:50:52.908]  Because I'm good at confronting people, and I actually stepped back.
[00:50:52.988 --> 00:50:56.190]  I mean, she was... She was very demonic.
[00:50:56.370 --> 00:50:56.950]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:03.252]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.452 --> 00:51:06.535]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.675 --> 00:51:10.579]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.619 --> 00:51:14.843]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:15.203 --> 00:51:18.967]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:19.127 --> 00:51:20.909]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.189 --> 00:51:24.410]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.450 --> 00:51:29.152]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.332 --> 00:51:32.374]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.554 --> 00:51:35.395]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.895 --> 00:51:42.018]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.538 --> 00:51:44.379]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:52:01.736 --> 00:52:04.758]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.098 --> 00:52:13.904]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.224 --> 00:52:18.907]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.367 --> 00:52:26.092]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.493 --> 00:52:38.282]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.762 --> 00:52:43.207]  The Berkey Lights rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.388 --> 00:52:45.851]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:45.871 --> 00:52:47.693]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:47.713 --> 00:52:48.914]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:52:48.994 --> 00:52:50.456]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.476 --> 00:52:51.537]  Now get available in Iowa.
[00:53:02.133 --> 00:53:08.102]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.322 --> 00:53:10.585]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:10.766 --> 00:53:17.115]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:17.495 --> 00:53:18.095]  I think so.
[00:53:33.004 --> 00:53:33.444]  We're good to go.
[00:53:33.484 --> 00:53:33.825]  I think?
[00:54:08.371 --> 00:54:11.693]  I've got a sneaking suspicion that that's an internet rumor and a joke.
[00:54:13.293 --> 00:54:19.096]  But just to be brief, I've been trying to note who I am by saying I'm Alex E. Jones.
[00:54:20.837 --> 00:54:22.618]  Because there's a bunch of other Alex Joneses.
[00:54:22.678 --> 00:54:24.158]  No, I don't work for the New York Times.
[00:54:24.238 --> 00:54:27.240]  No, I don't work at Harvard like Alex S. Jones.
[00:54:28.143 --> 00:54:31.825]  There's another Alex Jones who is a photographer for the Statesman here in Austin.
[00:54:32.246 --> 00:54:33.346]  A good photographer at that.
[00:54:33.406 --> 00:54:34.627]  He even has a political website.
[00:54:35.428 --> 00:54:36.488]  And no, I'm not him.
[00:54:36.508 --> 00:54:37.749]  I'm not he.
[00:54:37.769 --> 00:54:47.496]  And I've been saying I'm Alex E. Jones, and now I've got an email saying, Alex, are you the person that owns a factory in Canada that packages goods?
[00:54:48.356 --> 00:54:50.217]  It's an Alex E. Jones.
[00:54:51.518 --> 00:54:52.539]  So that's always fun.
[00:54:53.781 --> 00:54:54.882]  We know who you are now.
[00:54:54.902 --> 00:54:56.123]  You work for the New York Times.
[00:54:57.024 --> 00:54:58.905]  So you've got to watch stuff on the internet, folks.
[00:54:58.985 --> 00:55:02.288]  But Ann Coulter, what I do know is that she's a demon.
[00:55:03.129 --> 00:55:07.532]  And what I do know is that she speaks to the lowest common denominator of kind of a moron level.
[00:55:07.893 --> 00:55:12.677]  But I had her on and I thought she had the intellect of a marsupial possum.
[00:55:14.098 --> 00:55:16.820]  But I was at the RNC and saw her walk right past me.
[00:55:18.041 --> 00:55:21.504]  And she's real tall and so anorexic looking that
[00:55:22.390 --> 00:55:25.753]  I mean, she looked skeletal, and she looked just really evil.
[00:55:26.133 --> 00:55:30.696]  And her face was so pale and looked like a clown that had makeup painted on it.
[00:55:31.657 --> 00:55:33.418]  But I mean, she radiated a presence.
[00:55:34.019 --> 00:55:43.546]  A presence I haven't felt since the time I confronted Janet Reno, and she flashed this demonic smile and stuck her tongue out at me when she was here in town.
[00:55:43.586 --> 00:55:49.971]  I brought up Delta Force killing the Davidians, and that's in Police State 2, The Takeover, at the end of the film.
[00:55:51.051 --> 00:55:55.333]  I mean, Janet Reno, Mark Kornke called it shark eyes, great white eyes.
[00:55:57.194 --> 00:56:00.016]  Even if they have blue eyes, it's like their eyes are like black pits.
[00:56:00.156 --> 00:56:01.677]  I don't know how to explain it.
[00:56:02.657 --> 00:56:05.239]  But I've only encountered this a few times.
[00:56:05.279 --> 00:56:15.184]  I mean, I've confronted former CIA directors, former deputy directors face-to-face, gotten right in their face when they come to UT to propagandize, and they don't radiate that.
[00:56:15.804 --> 00:56:16.785]  It's these two people.
[00:56:16.885 --> 00:56:17.985]  I confronted Hillary Clinton.
[00:56:18.446 --> 00:56:19.206]  Didn't get this from her.
[00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:24.152]  Butch Reno and Ann Coulter are the two that I've experienced this.
[00:56:25.093 --> 00:56:31.436]  She didn't seem evil like that on the radio, but in person it was palpable, as they say.
[00:56:32.196 --> 00:56:34.978]  Go ahead, and Eric in Connecticut, anything else?
[00:56:36.078 --> 00:56:36.679]  Oh, he hung up.
[00:56:36.739 --> 00:56:39.480]  I thought we were going to go back to him and let him finish up his comments.
[00:56:39.500 --> 00:56:49.245]  Well, we'll go to... I'll go to Tom and Ralph and John and Tom and Steve and a bunch of other people
[00:56:50.177 --> 00:56:52.277]  And we'll go to your calls a little bit faster when we get back.
[00:56:53.198 --> 00:56:54.718]  I'd like to hear from callers, though.
[00:56:54.738 --> 00:56:56.578]  I mean, have we all been conditioned to accept this?
[00:56:56.938 --> 00:56:58.438]  It's now even come out in the New York Times.
[00:56:58.498 --> 00:57:04.059]  It's clear evidence that Mexican gangs are out killing black men and racially targeted killings.
[00:57:04.079 --> 00:57:09.580]  Can you imagine if bands of white people were running around killing black people?
[00:57:10.661 --> 00:57:13.681]  Or bands of blacks were out killing Hispanics or whites?
[00:57:14.221 --> 00:57:16.122]  Why are these Hispanic groups protected?
[00:57:16.982 --> 00:57:18.282]  And all of us should ask that question.
[00:57:20.106 --> 00:57:24.068]  Because the globalists are trying to build a race war in this country, and we've got to stop it.
[00:57:24.088 --> 00:57:25.528]  And I think we can.
[00:57:27.089 --> 00:57:36.832]  Before I end this hour, we're going to be showing Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State in Austin.
[00:57:37.273 --> 00:57:45.616]  And because other showings have sold out in Houston and Austin, when we showed Road to Tyranny, I'm going to show it on two separate nights, two showings the first night.
[00:57:45.636 --> 00:57:48.377]  It's going to be the night of Friday,
[00:57:49.722 --> 00:57:50.223]  The 3rd.
[00:57:50.583 --> 00:57:52.326]  Give us a month to promote this.
[00:57:52.746 --> 00:58:06.265]  The night of Friday the 3rd of June in the downtown Alamo Draft House and there will be food and there will be all your iced tea and coffee and all that other good stuff.
[00:58:08.048 --> 00:58:09.389]  Really nice theater downtown.
[00:58:09.409 --> 00:58:14.714]  We're going to have a 7 o'clock showing and a 10 o'clock showing, and I'm going to have a question and answer, give a speech at the end of each showing.
[00:58:15.134 --> 00:58:16.855]  Great place to meet like-minded people.
[00:58:17.096 --> 00:58:24.622]  Then the next week on Wednesday, we're going to have it at one of their even bigger locations on South Lamar, pretty close to my house.
[00:58:25.443 --> 00:58:26.764]  I like that.
[00:58:26.844 --> 00:58:28.685]  I go see movies there all the time.
[00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:30.266]  We're going to have that on the 8th.
[00:58:30.467 --> 00:58:31.828]  Now, tickets aren't for sale yet.
[00:58:32.208 --> 00:58:35.631]  Next few days we'll have links on Infowars.com for you.
[00:58:36.818 --> 00:58:38.339]  And I want to see everybody out there.
[00:58:38.359 --> 00:58:39.279]  It's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:58:39.959 --> 00:58:43.881]  If you want hard copies of the new film right now, go to Infowars.com to get your copy.
[00:58:44.341 --> 00:58:47.782]  All right, we're going to be right back with the second hour.
[00:58:47.802 --> 00:58:50.163]  If you want to see it on the big screen, you got it.
[00:58:51.763 --> 00:58:58.586]  Introduce... Big Brother.
[00:58:59.295 --> 00:59:00.356]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.076 --> 00:59:02.177]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.837 --> 00:59:03.677]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.398 --> 00:59:05.298]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.979 --> 00:59:09.621]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.141 --> 00:59:14.223]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:24.478 --> 00:59:29.939]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, now 35 seconds into this second hour.
[00:59:30.980 --> 00:59:35.921]  Coming up, we'll give you an update on Valiant Americans out in California during their Lurican Quista.
[00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:46.023]  The Clear Channel billboards that have been put up promoting local TV stations saying that California, L.A., belongs to Mexico.
[00:59:47.228 --> 00:59:51.892]  The establishment pushing this accusable and how that dovetails the latest developments.
[00:59:51.912 --> 00:59:54.213]  We heard it first here last week from Terry Anderson.
[00:59:54.233 --> 00:59:55.294]  Now it's in the New York Times.
[00:59:55.975 --> 01:00:00.758]  Groups of shaved-head Mexicans driving around shooting black men.
[01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:03.240]  And the order is out to kill 400 black men.
[01:00:04.421 --> 01:00:06.563]  And they are killing black men.
[01:00:07.543 --> 01:00:11.086]  And again, 98% of Hispanics are against killing black men.
[01:00:12.047 --> 01:00:14.729]  It's like I'd imagine 98% of blacks are against killing Hispanics.
[01:00:14.769 --> 01:00:14.869]  But
[01:00:16.032 --> 01:00:23.037]  A good portion, it's a minority, but I'd say 25% of the Hispanics in this country now are La Rican Quistas.
[01:00:23.917 --> 01:00:26.659]  And they run the gamut in how extreme they are.
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:31.082]  And the government is behind it trying to grow this group.
[01:00:31.562 --> 01:00:34.724]  And as Americans, we all have to stand up against this.
[01:00:35.945 --> 01:00:38.046]  My Hispanic friends are horrified by this.
[01:00:38.086 --> 01:00:39.747]  They understand what the globalists are doing.
[01:00:40.287 --> 01:00:41.168]  Very intelligent.
[01:00:42.333 --> 01:00:43.514]  I've said this over and over again.
[01:00:43.534 --> 01:00:49.939]  The predominant group, if you had to say one minority that's the biggest listener group, it'd have to be Hispanics.
[01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:51.620]  I mean, they understand tyranny.
[01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:52.961]  They know what Mexico is.
[01:00:52.981 --> 01:00:53.762]  They know history.
[01:00:55.383 --> 01:00:58.065]  They know about what our government's done to Mexico and other people.
[01:00:58.105 --> 01:00:59.226]  I mean, stuff has happened.
[01:00:59.626 --> 01:01:00.567]  And so they're not done.
[01:01:00.607 --> 01:01:03.649]  They're very intelligent, very acute.
[01:01:04.610 --> 01:01:08.893]  But there's this vicious group that's been taken over by the government, funded by the universities.
[01:01:09.915 --> 01:01:12.697]  You're controlled by a bunch of old white men that want to break this country up.
[01:01:12.717 --> 01:01:14.158]  You're being used as cannon fodder.
[01:01:14.358 --> 01:01:17.680]  Just like German Hessians were used as mercenaries by the British.
[01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:20.361]  And I'll attack those Germans if I was in 1776.
[01:01:21.682 --> 01:01:22.723]  Just like I'll fight you.
[01:01:23.163 --> 01:01:24.544]  Just like I'll bullhorn the Klan.
[01:01:24.984 --> 01:01:26.105]  You want to fight, you're going to get it.
[01:01:26.345 --> 01:01:27.726]  And how are they going to cover this up?
[01:01:27.866 --> 01:01:29.527]  Out killing black people now.
[01:01:31.588 --> 01:01:36.671]  I mean, when the Klan drags some poor black man to death, it's top news.
[01:01:38.621 --> 01:01:41.343]  But it's not news when the Mexicans are out doing this.
[01:01:42.063 --> 01:01:42.904]  So we're going to talk about it.
[01:01:43.404 --> 01:01:49.288]  Let's go to Tom in San Francisco, then Ralph, then John in San Diego, and others.
[01:01:49.808 --> 01:01:51.689]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:01:52.129 --> 01:01:52.550]  Hey, Alex.
[01:01:52.570 --> 01:01:53.030]  How's it going?
[01:01:53.230 --> 01:01:53.610]  Good, sir.
[01:01:54.211 --> 01:01:54.971]  Okay, I've got two things.
[01:01:55.451 --> 01:02:00.415]  I can talk a little bit about the Mexican invasions, so to say.
[01:02:01.595 --> 01:02:03.436]  But I wanted to bring up something else first, just quick.
[01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:05.458]  And I know you don't like doing the...
[01:02:06.548 --> 01:02:07.689]  I know you don't like it, but I'm going to do it.
[01:02:13.898 --> 01:02:17.380]  Yeah, well, I don't know if you've seen this.
[01:02:18.221 --> 01:02:19.642]  Understand, there's a tactic.
[01:02:20.162 --> 01:02:40.937]  You can get listeners by talking about issues, by fighting the New World Order, by getting involved over time, doing things, sneaking into Bohemian Grove, rebuilding a memorial church at Waco, confronting politicians, writing legislation, or you can attack people, get them to attack you, and it's a quick way to get listeners and viewers.
[01:02:41.318 --> 01:02:41.458]  So,
[01:02:42.205 --> 01:02:51.850]  Do you want to talk about the invasion, or do you want to... Well, no, I just wanted to... I mean, if you don't want to go there, I can... Well, because it only gives people what they want, sir.
[01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:56.152]  Well, there's one element of it that I thought was kind of ironic.
[01:02:56.693 --> 01:02:57.753]  I know it's ridiculous.
[01:02:58.333 --> 01:02:59.334]  Somebody emailed to me this morning.
[01:02:59.374 --> 01:02:59.634]  I read it.
[01:02:59.834 --> 01:03:00.595]  Who cares, sir?
[01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:03.276]  They're about to pass a national ID card.
[01:03:03.943 --> 01:03:04.303]  Okay?
[01:03:04.563 --> 01:03:06.784]  They're putting cancer viruses in your vaccines.
[01:03:06.844 --> 01:03:10.005]  Now, again, this stuff doesn't matter.
[01:03:10.585 --> 01:03:11.705]  It doesn't matter.
[01:03:11.865 --> 01:03:12.645]  Real issues.
[01:03:13.046 --> 01:03:17.487]  It is a disease in the truth movement that so many people do this.
[01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:19.007]  Some do it for ego.
[01:03:19.387 --> 01:03:20.548]  Some do it for attention.
[01:03:20.968 --> 01:03:23.208]  Others do it because they're paid, sir.
[01:03:23.629 --> 01:03:24.209]  Oh, I understand.
[01:03:24.309 --> 01:03:26.369]  Do you ever hear me attack other people in the truth movement?
[01:03:26.949 --> 01:03:27.390]  No, I don't.
[01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.090]  You do not hear it.
[01:03:29.770 --> 01:03:32.231]  And that's because, sir...
[01:03:34.156 --> 01:03:35.697]  This is a life and death fight for me.
[01:03:36.837 --> 01:03:37.538]  This is real.
[01:03:38.538 --> 01:03:39.919]  This isn't a cakewalk.
[01:03:39.999 --> 01:03:40.799]  This isn't a joke.
[01:03:41.539 --> 01:03:41.879]  Alright?
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:43.760]  This is the real deal.
[01:03:45.081 --> 01:03:46.441]  This is the real deal.
[01:03:46.822 --> 01:03:47.442]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:51.229 --> 01:03:55.555]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:55.755 --> 01:04:00.181]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:00.322 --> 01:04:04.708]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:04.748 --> 01:04:06.089]  The New World Order.
[01:04:07.831 --> 01:04:12.094]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:12.154 --> 01:04:19.080]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:19.220 --> 01:04:21.301]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:21.561 --> 01:04:31.969]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:31.989 --> 01:04:32.790]  If you want to understand
[01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:33.290]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:33.310 --> 01:04:34.852]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:51.343 --> 01:04:54.346]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:04:54.706 --> 01:05:03.515]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:05:03.855 --> 01:05:08.520]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:15.703]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:05:16.103 --> 01:05:27.889]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:28.369 --> 01:05:32.833]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:05:32.993 --> 01:05:35.455]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:05:40.078 --> 01:05:41.139]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:50.143 --> 01:05:56.249]  Do you have $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 or more in credit card debt that's suffocating your bank account and your lifestyle?
[01:05:56.389 --> 01:06:01.314]  If you think bankruptcy is the only way out, then pay close attention because relief is on the way.
[01:06:01.514 --> 01:06:04.437]  Debt Relief USA at 800-509-3201.
[01:06:04.897 --> 01:06:11.243]  We'll negotiate with your creditors and settle your credit card debt for about half of what you now owe without filing bankruptcy.
[01:06:11.423 --> 01:06:15.867]  Debt Relief USA has been helping people just like you regain control of their financial future.
[01:06:15.988 --> 01:06:19.091]  In most cases, you can be debt-free in less than 36 months.
[01:06:19.351 --> 01:06:23.014]  I owed so much on my credit cards, I could barely make the minimum monthly payment.
[01:06:23.154 --> 01:06:26.117]  We talked about filing bankruptcy, but I was concerned about my credit.
[01:06:26.318 --> 01:06:28.299]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:32.163]  They set up a plan for me where I could settle for just 40% of what I owed.
[01:06:32.403 --> 01:06:35.987]  I'm back in control of my life, and I owe it all to Debt Relief USA.
[01:06:36.147 --> 01:06:40.570]  Call Debt Relief USA today for your free consultation.
[01:06:40.590 --> 01:06:41.170]  800-509-3201.
[01:06:41.851 --> 01:06:43.772]  Pay your creditors and avoid bankruptcy.
[01:06:43.892 --> 01:06:46.214]  Call now.
[01:06:46.234 --> 01:06:46.714]  800-509-3201.
[01:06:46.734 --> 01:06:47.314]  800-509-3201.
[01:06:47.414 --> 01:06:58.442]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:06:59.062 --> 01:07:02.044]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.044 --> 01:07:22.030]  Public documents by Henry Kissinger and Ted Turner and Prince Philip and Jacques Cousteau and documents from the World Health Organization say they want to get rid of 80 to 95% of us.
[01:07:23.711 --> 01:07:27.973]  They are putting poisons and toxins and viruses in vaccines worldwide.
[01:07:29.553 --> 01:07:32.955]  They are trying to forcibly inoculate people in Africa.
[01:07:33.675 --> 01:07:34.515]  They're refusing.
[01:07:34.536 --> 01:07:35.676]  They're coming and arresting them.
[01:07:37.353 --> 01:07:39.194]  So many horrible things are happening.
[01:07:40.094 --> 01:07:43.535]  That's why I've always said this broadcast is not about Alex Jones.
[01:07:44.195 --> 01:07:45.756]  It's not about personalities.
[01:07:46.276 --> 01:07:53.078]  We have young black men being murdered as they drive to work in their cars because MS-13 has ordered it.
[01:07:55.419 --> 01:07:58.000]  The Latin American narco-terrorist group.
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.981]  And the media is doing all they can to cover it up.
[01:08:01.201 --> 01:08:03.902]  I can't even believe it's the New York Times, but they can't cover this up anymore.
[01:08:05.043 --> 01:08:09.226]  We have got Border Patrol being targeted and the Minutemen being targeted for murder by this group.
[01:08:09.947 --> 01:08:11.908]  We have their houses and cars being shot up.
[01:08:13.429 --> 01:08:14.150]  Kidnappings.
[01:08:15.431 --> 01:08:16.771]  We've got to stay on point.
[01:08:16.812 --> 01:08:18.893]  We've got to stay focused on real issues.
[01:08:19.353 --> 01:08:31.362]  A telltale sign of people that are either egomaniacs or are just cynically trying to get listeners or viewers or who are feds, and it runs the gamut out there, is that about half of what they'll do is attack other, quote, truth seekers.
[01:08:32.754 --> 01:08:39.418]  I mean, you don't see me running around making the debate about 9-11, about the pod, or about the Pentagon.
[01:08:39.638 --> 01:08:41.379]  And clearly the Pentagon is a legitimate issue.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:43.440]  It's all legitimate.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:48.683]  You don't see me saying I'm the Grand Poobah, though I am really the founder of the 9-11 Truth Movement.
[01:08:48.703 --> 01:08:49.744]  I mean, I talked about it before it happened.
[01:08:50.864 --> 01:08:53.306]  You don't hear me telling everybody that they've got to agree with me.
[01:08:53.406 --> 01:08:54.666]  I have all of yous on.
[01:08:54.846 --> 01:08:57.288]  I have people on who are about issues.
[01:08:58.368 --> 01:09:02.809]  This is a platform for issues where I can promote other people's books and materials.
[01:09:02.849 --> 01:09:03.650]  That's what I'm trying to do.
[01:09:04.030 --> 01:09:06.091]  And to promote you getting involved in being leaders.
[01:09:08.251 --> 01:09:11.212]  And so that's one of the few things I don't allow in this broadcast.
[01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:12.593]  And you know, I always had that rule.
[01:09:12.853 --> 01:09:13.153]  Always.
[01:09:13.913 --> 01:09:17.854]  And I once broke that rule and it was divisive and it wasn't good.
[01:09:20.355 --> 01:09:25.937]  Because somebody got up on national TV on CNN and tried to basically say
[01:09:26.847 --> 01:09:28.388]  Remember all the mailbox mommings?
[01:09:29.408 --> 01:09:31.249]  Tried to say that it was probably patriots.
[01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:32.809]  The black helicopter people.
[01:09:33.429 --> 01:09:38.391]  And that was such a betrayal by a person that I had supported when they were in financial trouble, court trouble.
[01:09:39.151 --> 01:09:43.113]  And then I had them on the show and they were so arrogant about it that I did get mad and started attacking them.
[01:09:43.333 --> 01:09:44.273]  And it didn't do any good.
[01:09:44.293 --> 01:09:45.074]  I should have just ignored it.
[01:09:47.794 --> 01:09:49.875]  We have got... It is a disease.
[01:09:50.495 --> 01:09:52.036]  And a lot of times it's financed.
[01:09:54.132 --> 01:09:55.272]  I mean, look at who attacks me.
[01:09:55.292 --> 01:10:03.815]  Vanity Fair, New York Times, Washington Post, Parade Magazine, Front Page Magazine, American Legion.
[01:10:04.675 --> 01:10:08.596]  The list goes on and on and on and on and on.
[01:10:08.696 --> 01:10:12.217]  C-SPAN will devote an hour and a half with a professor attacking me.
[01:10:12.737 --> 01:10:13.457]  Continually.
[01:10:14.978 --> 01:10:16.038]  And won't let me respond.
[01:10:18.459 --> 01:10:19.279]  Won't let me respond.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:22.940]  But so be it.
[01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:27.713]  And then you've got to look at the so-called patriots who are attacking me and ask yourselves, what's going on there?
[01:10:29.073 --> 01:10:30.374]  It doesn't matter, folks.
[01:10:30.434 --> 01:10:32.856]  We have serious issues.
[01:10:33.536 --> 01:10:35.998]  They have goats and cows with human brains.
[01:10:36.078 --> 01:10:40.340]  Not human genetics in their brains, predominantly human brains.
[01:10:42.222 --> 01:10:49.146]  We have cockroach genes in tomatoes and human genes in rice and bug genes and salmon genes in corn.
[01:10:50.245 --> 01:10:54.706]  The government's openly talking about making the population take microchips.
[01:10:55.206 --> 01:10:56.026]  I've got to go to calls.
[01:10:56.307 --> 01:10:58.187]  Finish up what you were saying.
[01:10:59.087 --> 01:11:01.028]  Tom in San Francisco, I've got to hurry here.
[01:11:01.148 --> 01:11:02.388]  Okay, yeah.
[01:11:02.448 --> 01:11:10.130]  Basically, I'm a white American, but I work for a Spanish-language television station here in the Bay Area.
[01:11:11.030 --> 01:11:18.392]  For all this time, we were very anti-war, and so a lot of the Latinos that I work with, I'd be talking to them about stuff and showing them all the
[01:11:18.959 --> 01:11:19.439]  We're good to go.
[01:11:43.263 --> 01:11:46.365]  It has nothing to do with the fact that they're Latino or the fact that they want to immigrate.
[01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:47.145]  Well, ask them.
[01:11:47.205 --> 01:11:54.430]  If we were Guatemalans and there were 30 million of us that had come into Mexico and we were saying, this is our land, I mean, what would they do?
[01:11:54.450 --> 01:11:58.452]  So they're being mean to you.
[01:11:58.492 --> 01:12:11.540]  No, what I'm saying is that people that can see, they know not to believe the media when it comes to some things, but then they go with the other thing and they go and they believe everything that they're hearing and helping to perpetuate on the airwaves.
[01:12:12.161 --> 01:12:12.921]  What do they say to you?
[01:12:13.376 --> 01:12:26.747]  Well, they don't really... It's not that they say much to me, but it's just that, you know, it's like a... How can I talk with them to, like, you know, get them to see, like, what the... Like, where the issue is, that the issue is not about a racist thing.
[01:12:26.807 --> 01:12:30.490]  It's about the, you know... But then you said all of a sudden they're looking at you.
[01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:31.070]  What does that mean?
[01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:41.959]  Well, because they've seen... I've showed you two videos of two people I work with, and they, you know, as far as when it comes to 9-11 or the Iraq war, that kind of stuff,
[01:12:42.878 --> 01:12:45.460]  The viruses and the vaccines, they're down with it.
[01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:52.804]  But then as soon as they hear, you know, you talk about the border, you know, they all of a sudden, they instantly go into defense mode.
[01:12:52.984 --> 01:12:56.566]  You know, San Francisco, very liberal town, so they got that, you know, it's the left side.
[01:12:56.746 --> 01:13:01.648]  And that's why we may lose this fight if we don't shift out of this.
[01:13:02.509 --> 01:13:08.092]  That's what I'm trying to find, like a great way of... Let me try to break this down, okay?
[01:13:08.892 --> 01:13:09.413]  Just briefly.
[01:13:09.473 --> 01:13:11.534]  Explain to them that they're playing checkers.
[01:13:12.853 --> 01:13:14.274]  And the globalists are playing chess.
[01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:21.098]  Ask them, why, if George Bush is for all these bad things that you know are bad, why is he vehemently for total amnesty?
[01:13:21.979 --> 01:13:24.500]  And they'll say, oh, well, because that's what people want.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.283]  Well, no, 67%, here's your own polls of your own target demographic aren't for this.
[01:13:29.844 --> 01:13:30.324]  Why are you?
[01:13:30.404 --> 01:13:31.705]  Why is the corporate money for this?
[01:13:32.365 --> 01:13:33.106]  That's one point.
[01:13:33.266 --> 01:13:40.210]  And you can show them the documents, the news articles, the polls, and they'll go, oh, explain to them, break it down for them,
[01:13:41.982 --> 01:13:42.763]  That's what I've tried to say.
[01:13:42.783 --> 01:13:46.186]  I've tried to say, hey, look, Bush is against the Minutemen, so doesn't that tell you something?
[01:13:47.407 --> 01:13:51.030]  But they can't break... They're having trouble breaking that.
[01:13:51.110 --> 01:13:52.491]  It's because it's very tribal.
[01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:53.772]  They're all tribal.
[01:13:54.092 --> 01:13:56.854]  I mean, this is really the answer to your question.
[01:13:57.515 --> 01:13:59.897]  Why couldn't... I mean, look, Bill Clinton's for the war.
[01:13:59.917 --> 01:14:00.978]  He's for all the things that Bush is.
[01:14:01.278 --> 01:14:02.499]  And he's now a surrogate member of the family.
[01:14:03.266 --> 01:14:04.247]  You've got to ask him this.
[01:14:04.727 --> 01:14:07.570]  Why couldn't Democrats wake up to the fact that Clinton was evil?
[01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:09.692]  They switched off their thinking process.
[01:14:10.072 --> 01:14:13.655]  Why can't Republicans wake up to the fact that Bush is evil?
[01:14:14.316 --> 01:14:25.125]  Because they've invested their association of power, they've invested their identity with a cause, with an idea, and they can't admit they're being conned.
[01:14:25.786 --> 01:14:29.049]  And so you've got to explain to them how the very foundations...
[01:14:29.801 --> 01:14:52.749]  The very organizations, the Ford Foundation and others, that are openly carrying out policies that are enslaving the people of Latin America, the very foundations that push the systems of the IMF and World Bank that abuse their populations, the very gunboat diplomacy that has abused Latin Americans, our government's done horrible things to them, is the very group pushing the Lurie Conquista.
[01:14:53.649 --> 01:14:55.810]  Now, that's where you can explain this to them.
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:15:03.863]  Well, I'm just going to let you know that I'm going to keep up the fight, though, trying to keep the truth coming through to them, and, you know, one person at a time if I have to.
[01:15:04.023 --> 01:15:07.065]  And I had a chance to talk to you a little bit in the break, and you were trying to defend me earlier.
[01:15:07.085 --> 01:15:08.545]  I don't need defense.
[01:15:08.625 --> 01:15:08.965]  Oh, no.
[01:15:09.386 --> 01:15:13.147]  I don't need defense from ridiculous, you know, ridiculous stuff.
[01:15:13.467 --> 01:15:16.028]  There's a lot of people posing as me out on the Internet.
[01:15:16.409 --> 01:15:23.312]  An old tactic here in Austin was somebody for five years, and I had to give people ideas, would...
[01:15:25.834 --> 01:15:29.395]  Reprogram fax machines and send threats in my name.
[01:15:30.336 --> 01:15:35.959]  They would call into radio and local TV shows and go, this is Alex Jones.
[01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:38.400]  Start saying the N-word.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.021]  And people just see right through that.
[01:15:41.761 --> 01:15:45.563]  So you don't have to defend me from just ridiculous stuff like that.
[01:15:45.603 --> 01:15:46.084]  Thanks for the call.
[01:15:46.544 --> 01:15:47.985]  God bless you, Michael.
[01:15:48.145 --> 01:15:51.406]  I mean, there's no need there.
[01:15:52.387 --> 01:15:52.767]  It's funny.
[01:15:54.203 --> 01:16:00.027]  That's part of the plan, to get you to spend your time defending myself instead of fighting the New World Order.
[01:16:01.268 --> 01:16:09.455]  What you need to defend me on is the fact that somebody comes out and attacks me six months ago and says, I broke the news of the 9-11 drills.
[01:16:09.975 --> 01:16:15.940]  Alex Jones plagiarized me when I made a film three years ago with the drills in it.
[01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:18.842]  When the Associated Press three years ago reported the drills,
[01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:21.523]  I had it months before it came out in the AP.
[01:16:22.103 --> 01:16:23.363]  I don't care who got the news.
[01:16:23.924 --> 01:16:25.244]  The point is, we put the news out.
[01:16:25.544 --> 01:16:27.605]  Well, people come out, and that's a substantive attack.
[01:16:28.085 --> 01:16:34.307]  Alex Jones, why he is copying me.
[01:16:35.287 --> 01:16:36.328]  That's ridiculous.
[01:16:36.948 --> 01:16:39.649]  That's a substantive attack that needs to be responded to.
[01:16:40.469 --> 01:16:42.750]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:45.551]  Let's talk to Ralph in Pennsylvania, and then...
[01:16:47.538 --> 01:16:48.759]  John in San Diego and others.
[01:16:48.799 --> 01:16:49.439]  Go ahead, Ralph.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:50.800]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:16:51.181 --> 01:16:52.221]  I'm fired up today.
[01:16:52.301 --> 01:16:54.423]  You're talking about these Mexican people.
[01:16:54.443 --> 01:17:01.788]  You go back centuries ago where the Spanish Inquisition went on the attack of Christians over the years ago.
[01:17:01.808 --> 01:17:03.089]  This is centuries ago.
[01:17:03.109 --> 01:17:08.173]  It's just repeating itself, except they're doing more of the innocent people.
[01:17:08.193 --> 01:17:16.939]  If you look in Revelation on the second beast with the first beast, I mean, the total attacks they can place
[01:17:17.734 --> 01:17:21.136]  They're just constantly, constantly attacking.
[01:17:21.316 --> 01:17:23.557]  That's the plan for Satan and his advocates.
[01:17:23.898 --> 01:17:26.539]  Well, I mean, the plan of the globalists is divide and conquer.
[01:17:26.559 --> 01:17:27.400]  I said this yesterday.
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:31.342]  In Africa, the UN will play one black tribe off against the other.
[01:17:31.562 --> 01:17:32.302]  There's no difference.
[01:17:32.342 --> 01:17:33.303]  They're Africans.
[01:17:33.663 --> 01:17:36.525]  But they'll play one tribe off against the other tribe.
[01:17:37.565 --> 01:17:38.486]  They do this everywhere.
[01:17:38.506 --> 01:17:40.507]  They play different groups off against each other.
[01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:42.428]  It's called balkanization.
[01:17:42.468 --> 01:17:43.569]  Look, Rezegna Brzezinski...
[01:17:44.887 --> 01:17:46.948]  Says in his own... Founder of the Trilateral Commission.
[01:17:46.988 --> 01:17:48.189]  Said in his book, The Grand Chessboard.
[01:17:48.969 --> 01:17:49.990]  Man, I plugged that too much.
[01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:51.711]  But the point is, we got the quotes on the website.
[01:17:52.031 --> 01:17:54.072]  He says they've got to play us off against each other.
[01:17:54.632 --> 01:17:56.033]  That's the key to empire.
[01:17:56.733 --> 01:18:00.155]  So I'm saying let's wake up to this and let's see through it.
[01:18:00.195 --> 01:18:00.795]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:01.295 --> 01:18:02.256]  I appreciate the call.
[01:18:02.316 --> 01:18:08.319]  We're going to come back and I'll go right to the caller in San Diego, caller in Ohio, another caller in Ohio.
[01:18:08.799 --> 01:18:09.780]  Then we've got a guest coming up.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:11.040]  Continue with the news and your calls.
[01:18:11.741 --> 01:18:11.881]  But...
[01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:18.296]  Let's stay focused, ladies and gentlemen, on the New World Order.
[01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:20.757]  The NWO.
[01:18:22.177 --> 01:18:22.577]  All right?
[01:18:24.418 --> 01:18:35.681]  Dave Von Kleist, Alex Jones, Pastor Butch Paw, Dr. Stan Monteith, George Norrie, people like that can't take your liberty.
[01:18:35.741 --> 01:18:37.041]  They can't come and tax you.
[01:18:37.601 --> 01:18:39.342]  They're not the government taking your children.
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.201]  You know, we're not... No.
[01:18:41.761 --> 01:18:44.603]  It's the NWO we need to be focused on.
[01:18:45.143 --> 01:18:47.324]  Not attacking all these alternative news people.
[01:18:47.925 --> 01:18:50.666]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.248]  Be a part of the new gold rush.
[01:18:53.688 --> 01:18:58.011]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[01:18:58.391 --> 01:18:59.292]  It still is.
[01:18:59.892 --> 01:19:03.394]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:19:03.714 --> 01:19:05.535]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:19:06.076 --> 01:19:08.117]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:19:08.835 --> 01:19:09.475]  We're good to go.
[01:19:09.535 --> 01:19:09.715]  I think?
[01:19:36.895 --> 01:19:42.982]  In business over 10 years, make the call and see why the ultra-rich invest in gold and other precious metals.
[01:19:43.562 --> 01:19:45.084]  We'll rush you the free information.

[01:20:01.527 --> 01:20:12.753]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:20:13.093 --> 01:20:18.796]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[01:20:19.036 --> 01:20:19.557]  We're good to go.
[01:20:50.742 --> 01:20:51.883]  Why do you wear watches?
[01:20:52.183 --> 01:20:54.745]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[01:20:55.226 --> 01:21:02.791]  At DiscountWatchStore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.

[01:21:50.629 --> 01:21:52.971]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:21:53.232 --> 01:21:57.075]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:21:57.396 --> 01:21:58.217]  Read the labels.
[01:21:58.637 --> 01:22:02.781]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:22:03.001 --> 01:22:07.186]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:22:07.566 --> 01:22:12.431]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:22:12.811 --> 01:22:16.355]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.

[01:23:22.767 --> 01:23:26.311]  Let's go ahead and go to John in San Diego, California.
[01:23:26.331 --> 01:23:26.692]  Go ahead.
[01:23:27.549 --> 01:23:31.850]  I hereby am declaring Martial Law the greatest documentary ever.
[01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:50.373]  And for anyone who hasn't picked up the copy, I urge you to go into your DVD collection and either throw away or sell some of the New World Order hegemony-propagating satanic ideology DVDs that people have collected and pick up Martial Law.
[01:23:51.014 --> 01:23:52.034]  And I have a question for you.
[01:23:52.054 --> 01:23:53.054]  I'll take comments off air.
[01:23:53.627 --> 01:23:56.649]  What do you know about adrenochrome?
[01:23:56.709 --> 01:24:02.111]  I know that Hunter Thompson wrote about getting some from a Satanist in Fear and Loathing.
[01:24:02.551 --> 01:24:03.292]  Is it real?
[01:24:04.112 --> 01:24:07.134]  Do they get real human adrenochrome?
[01:24:07.254 --> 01:24:07.674]  Did they?
[01:24:07.734 --> 01:24:08.574]  What do you know about that?
[01:24:08.674 --> 01:24:09.315]  Thank you very much.
[01:24:10.035 --> 01:24:10.875]  Thanks for the call.
[01:24:11.396 --> 01:24:12.656]  I appreciate it.
[01:24:13.016 --> 01:24:14.237]  I guess that caller is gone now.
[01:24:14.257 --> 01:24:17.459]  I wanted to ask him why he liked Martial Law.
[01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:18.899]  It is definitely my best film.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:22.061]  Adrenochrome.
[01:24:22.697 --> 01:24:51.333]  It has been reported by David Icke and others, and he just mentioned Hunter S. Thompson, that the globalists like to take body parts, like to take the different chemicals from the human body, the hormone mixture that's produced during extreme terror, and then take that
[01:24:52.085 --> 01:24:53.085]  And use that as a drug.
[01:24:54.406 --> 01:24:57.447]  But they eat the pituitary gland or extracts of it.
[01:24:58.347 --> 01:24:59.567]  And I don't know if that's true.
[01:25:00.708 --> 01:25:01.628]  But it keeps popping up.
[01:25:01.688 --> 01:25:13.452]  What I do know is they do take these chemicals from the bodies of cadavers and use them in drugs, especially 30, 40 years ago before they could produce synthetic systems.
[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:15.960]  Synthetic copies.
[01:25:16.180 --> 01:25:19.581]  And then even in the study and research to make those synthetics, they do have to get it.
[01:25:20.021 --> 01:25:31.184]  I know that, I mean, it's been in the mainstream news, just in the mainstream news yesterday, the caller did send me that article, by the way, I appreciate it, that in Russia, in China, they melt down the aborted babies.
[01:25:32.345 --> 01:25:34.765]  In China, the infanticide babies that were already born.
[01:25:35.446 --> 01:25:40.827]  And they do use their fat for collagen for the women's lips and the men's other unsundry parts.
[01:25:42.132 --> 01:25:44.414]  And that's really going on, so that's just as bad.
[01:25:44.434 --> 01:25:46.395]  I mean, we know that's happening.
[01:25:46.955 --> 01:25:57.742]  We know that they're creating baby humans, clones of humans, that have enough animal genes in them where they don't, quote, aren't considered humans, so they have no rights.
[01:25:58.403 --> 01:26:04.386]  That was in the Associated Press over the weekend, a horrifying report, reporting on it like it was no big deal.
[01:26:06.008 --> 01:26:09.230]  Oh, well, this is only 90% human, so it has no rights.
[01:26:09.250 --> 01:26:11.251]  It can harvest its organs.
[01:26:12.307 --> 01:26:18.251]  And Harvest, that's like something out of The Dark Crystal, that old horror movie where they suck the life force out of you and drink it.
[01:26:19.071 --> 01:26:31.479]  And yes, I have read in really old history books, what was the name of that European queen who would bathe in maiden's blood and drink their blood?
[01:26:31.499 --> 01:26:32.880]  She thought it was a health potion.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:41.085]  They do have some things they do in Russia and China where you can go pay a lot of money for these gene therapies and they take the sanguinated...
[01:26:42.196 --> 01:26:47.860]  Uh, liquids from babies that they've killed and fetuses they've killed and then pump it through your body.
[01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:51.942]  So, I mean, there's historical precedence for that.
[01:26:53.343 --> 01:27:01.288]  There are some African tribes, there are some tribes out in the Pacific that eat certain areas of the brain and think it's a drug.
[01:27:01.328 --> 01:27:03.529]  So, the more I think about it, yeah, that's real.
[01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:08.112]  I mean, I don't know if Hunter S. Thompson was running around gobbling it.
[01:27:08.132 --> 01:27:08.492]  Uh, but...
[01:27:10.589 --> 01:27:17.172]  I know this, the government's produced super drugs, super designer drugs that make all the illegal drugs look like child's play and are much worse for you.
[01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:20.793]  And they're coming out with a lot of those and pushing them on us, the New Freedom Initiative.
[01:27:21.793 --> 01:27:24.975]  We're going to come back, we've got a guest coming on to talk about a serious issue.
[01:27:25.875 --> 01:27:39.280]  We're going to be discussing this New York Times report, what you heard last week from Terry Anderson, about the reports of 400 black men to be killed by the end of summer by the Mexican Mafia.
[01:27:39.984 --> 01:27:51.509]  Now they're having to admit in the New York Times that one of the survivors of the last seven shootings didn't report that it was four to five Hispanic men with shaved heads, which is what this gang, that's one of their signs is the shaved head.
[01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:53.710]  Very, very serious.
[01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:57.312]  We'll be talking about that on the other side of this quick break.
[01:27:57.332 --> 01:27:59.613]  Don't forget the website, presentplanet.tv.
[01:27:59.633 --> 01:28:00.033]  Stay with us.
[01:28:05.570 --> 01:28:06.451]  We're on the march.
[01:28:06.952 --> 01:28:08.573]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:09.474 --> 01:28:12.157]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:17.671 --> 01:28:23.176]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:28:23.596 --> 01:28:28.140]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:35.105]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:28:35.466 --> 01:28:41.571]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:28:41.731 --> 01:28:42.952]  There are no side effects.
[01:28:43.032 --> 01:28:43.593]  We're good to go.
[01:29:00.055 --> 01:29:03.139]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[01:30:38.163 --> 01:30:38.924]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[01:30:44.188 --> 01:30:47.791]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[01:30:47.971 --> 01:30:51.894]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[01:30:52.035 --> 01:30:55.537]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[01:30:55.918 --> 01:31:03.504]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[01:31:03.784 --> 01:31:07.067]  Keep it clean, and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[01:31:07.487 --> 01:31:11.130]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:13.212]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[01:31:18.041 --> 01:31:24.066]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:31:24.666 --> 01:31:27.648]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:40.718 --> 01:31:43.000]  The Washington Post and others reported...
[01:31:44.312 --> 01:31:59.305]  Last Friday, that all over the country, the feds are now lifting the rule that they've had in the past that frowned against putting toll roads on interstate highways.
[01:31:59.325 --> 01:32:00.246]  They're going to do it all over.
[01:32:00.286 --> 01:32:02.168]  Well, that's part of the federal plan.
[01:32:02.528 --> 01:32:07.472]  6,000 miles in Texas alone on state roads and in the cities, 2,000 in the cities, 4,000 outside the cities.
[01:32:10.948 --> 01:32:25.452]  And just the corruption, the intimidation, the dirty tricks that have been involved in trying to fight what we're doing here in Central Texas, our defense of the roads being free and not being taxation control grids.
[01:32:25.813 --> 01:32:27.293]  That's coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[01:32:27.313 --> 01:32:29.134]  We'll continue with calls and news.
[01:32:30.214 --> 01:32:34.015]  Right now, I have William Gein on with us.
[01:32:34.035 --> 01:32:36.776]  He's the president and the head of Americans...
[01:32:38.183 --> 01:32:39.863]  For legal immigration.
[01:32:40.204 --> 01:32:53.527]  We had him on last week because one of their members got the photograph and broke the story of these billboards that have since been all over the news for a local powerhouse Spanish station in L.A.
[01:32:54.147 --> 01:33:07.030]  on a Clear Channel billboard that said your team covering the news of Los Angeles and crossed out California and put Mexico.
[01:33:08.200 --> 01:33:12.141]  We've since learned there's more of these billboards with other little disgusting comments.
[01:33:13.441 --> 01:33:20.883]  Well, now some patriots have climbed up there with an American flag and hung it, artfully done as well, over this.
[01:33:21.643 --> 01:33:22.643]  And I can only commend them.
[01:33:23.704 --> 01:33:31.286]  So I wanted to get Mr. Gein on, but really that pales in significance compared to the media's response and their attempt to kind of cover this up.
[01:33:31.746 --> 01:33:36.627]  And then secondarily, I wanted to get his take on the New York Times now, having to admit that what our guest...
[01:33:39.542 --> 01:33:49.726]  Terry Anderson said last week, it looks like it's true, the Mexican Mafia and MS-13, the reports are, are going to target and try to kill 400 black men in the Southwest.
[01:33:50.747 --> 01:33:54.388]  Looks like they've already got five down and injured seven total.
[01:33:55.068 --> 01:33:58.150]  Looks like they're doing a pretty good job of it so far in the first week of launching this.
[01:33:58.470 --> 01:34:02.512]  And now it's even in the New York Times they have to admit that witnesses are saying shaved head Hispanics.
[01:34:03.452 --> 01:34:05.793]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:34:06.423 --> 01:34:06.964]  I'm Mr. Gein.
[01:34:07.424 --> 01:34:14.150]  Alex, I'm glad to be here, and I've got some brand spanking new news that I'm very pleased that we can announce on your show for the first time.
[01:34:14.390 --> 01:34:14.771]  Thank you.
[01:34:15.451 --> 01:34:18.634]  First of all, on the signs, there's approximately 75 of the signs.
[01:34:19.095 --> 01:34:21.357]  Oh, I'm sorry, I was saying seven as of yesterday.
[01:34:21.417 --> 01:34:22.158]  Okay.
[01:34:22.358 --> 01:34:30.085]  The count is they put up 75, and I want to commend the folks that hung that flag over the word Mexico, too, because they gave us another photo.
[01:34:31.191 --> 01:34:37.414]  A picture worth a thousand words, and that was really classy compared to what a lot of people were thinking about doing to those signs, Alex.
[01:34:38.074 --> 01:34:48.399]  Now, then they'll say you're a terrorist, and to describe how they did this, they didn't even damage the sign because, you know, in a hurry, I'd imagine using spray paint or something, but they didn't do that.
[01:34:48.739 --> 01:34:55.562]  No, they hung Old Glory right over Mexico, and it was the best thing anybody could have done, and nobody knows who they are.
[01:34:55.662 --> 01:34:56.583]  They know who they are.
[01:34:57.271 --> 01:34:58.032]  Yes.
[01:34:58.412 --> 01:35:00.933]  We all owe them a great deal of thanks for what they did.
[01:35:01.073 --> 01:35:03.315]  Those signs don't look like they're easy to get up on.
[01:35:03.975 --> 01:35:08.998]  The new news is we just got emails at Alley Pack about 30 minutes ago from Clear Channel.
[01:35:09.528 --> 01:35:15.972]  Which were responses to our earlier emails when we first discovered the signs, when we sent them messages like, is this your sign?
[01:35:16.873 --> 01:35:17.513]  You want to confess?
[01:35:17.533 --> 01:35:22.777]  But, I mean, now the owner of the network admits they've done it.
[01:35:23.898 --> 01:35:25.579]  That is the person that paid for the advertising.
[01:35:25.599 --> 01:35:26.479]  This is admitted now.
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:28.261]  It's been in California TV and print.
[01:35:28.621 --> 01:35:29.561]  Finally, we broke through that.
[01:35:29.622 --> 01:35:31.683]  Now you're talking about the owners of the billboard itself.
[01:35:31.943 --> 01:35:37.687]  Well, Clear Channel just released about 30 minutes ago via email to those that had inquired
[01:35:38.188 --> 01:35:49.755]  That they have reached an agreement with the local advertiser, Channel 62, to change the content of the signs on 5605.
[01:35:51.976 --> 01:35:55.339]  And for further information and comment, we can contact them locally.
[01:35:55.399 --> 01:35:58.080]  So what are they going to say now?
[01:35:58.480 --> 01:36:04.204]  Well, it might be a flip off, but we're thinking that the word Mexico is coming out of those signs.
[01:36:04.244 --> 01:36:04.904]  We don't have that 100%.
[01:36:06.472 --> 01:36:08.255]  Um, confirmed at this point.
[01:36:08.695 --> 01:36:16.766]  But the guy, what Gottlieb wanted, he wanted publicity, but we've got publicity to show what their racist mentality is.
[01:36:17.307 --> 01:36:21.132]  Exactly, and I don't think they wanted this kind of publicity anymore.
[01:36:21.632 --> 01:36:22.833]  I don't think we should stop here.
[01:36:23.093 --> 01:36:25.355]  I mean, obviously, Claire Channel, here I am defending him.
[01:36:25.395 --> 01:36:25.875]  I'm not really.
[01:36:25.915 --> 01:36:30.959]  I mean, Claire Channel did put up the horrible sign saying, Bush, our leader, that looked like something out of North Korea.
[01:36:30.999 --> 01:36:31.639]  That was bad.
[01:36:32.059 --> 01:36:34.181]  But they're not really completely at fault here.
[01:36:34.301 --> 01:36:35.542]  It's the guy who bought the signs.
[01:36:35.822 --> 01:36:38.684]  We need to see who his advertisers are and boycott them.
[01:36:39.184 --> 01:36:41.306]  That is already being compiled, and we're working.
[01:36:41.326 --> 01:36:41.866]  Oh, excellent.
[01:36:42.186 --> 01:36:42.987]  We're working on it.
[01:36:43.027 --> 01:36:48.851]  There's something we've wanted to do at Alley Pack for a long time, and other people have thought of ways to do this and tried ways to do this.
[01:36:49.438 --> 01:36:54.500]  We want to do a national targeted boycott of about five companies.
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:02.163]  We want to select these companies carefully, make sure they're companies that consumers can choose another brand name easily.
[01:37:02.904 --> 01:37:10.487]  But we want to target five companies that we know are supporting open borders and get a sustained national boycott going.
[01:37:10.527 --> 01:37:17.690]  Because these companies, their political action committees, are going to be there trying to take down the good patriots in Congress that stand with the public.
[01:37:18.171 --> 01:37:20.095]  And they're going to be fighting against the candidates.
[01:37:20.175 --> 01:37:25.406]  Well, it's like George Bush put out the memo and it was in roll call last year targeting Tom Tancredo.
[01:37:26.076 --> 01:37:29.617]  Well, George Bush is one of the reasons, big reasons, we have this problem.
[01:37:29.717 --> 01:37:32.819]  And anybody that knows the situation can tell you that.
[01:37:33.439 --> 01:37:40.002]  And, you know, we're going to keep talking about catch and release and how this administration has ordered our Border Patrol to hand people tickets.
[01:37:40.302 --> 01:37:42.302]  Now, what I do want to talk about is gatekeepers.
[01:37:42.843 --> 01:37:44.383]  Neocon gatekeepers.
[01:37:45.324 --> 01:37:47.044]  Free Republic used to be a great organization.
[01:37:47.064 --> 01:37:47.544]  I support them.
[01:37:47.564 --> 01:37:48.685]  They have a lot of great members.
[01:37:49.401 --> 01:37:53.366]  But I remember AP articles about Delta Force drills and raids in Texas.
[01:37:53.406 --> 01:37:54.347]  They take those down.
[01:37:55.188 --> 01:37:56.890]  I saw reports on your website.
[01:37:57.150 --> 01:38:06.281]  I want to know if you confirm those, that they were taking down the photo that even World Net Daily and other publications carried of the La Reconquista sign.
[01:38:06.321 --> 01:38:06.801]  Is that true?
[01:38:07.222 --> 01:38:08.984]  For your public, most of the members...
[01:38:09.807 --> 01:38:14.029]  They do support what Alley Pack is doing and others are doing to fight illegal immigration.
[01:38:14.089 --> 01:38:20.431]  Unfortunately, the controllers of Free Republic are acting as if they're in the bag with the RNC and George Bush.
[01:38:20.871 --> 01:38:27.633]  And when those billboard photos were put up on Free Republic, they pulled the post down, revoked the membership.
[01:38:27.953 --> 01:38:32.855]  In one case, a member of Alley Pack who's been a member of Free Republic for years revoked her membership.
[01:38:33.335 --> 01:38:38.677]  But now the photo's been all over LATV and radio, websites, and it's been on the news.
[01:38:39.117 --> 01:38:42.498]  Well, let me finish this, Alex, because you'll understand what's going on here.
[01:38:42.858 --> 01:38:51.461]  They revoked her membership and put up a sign so when others looked at her account to see why it was banned, it says, racist.
[01:38:52.401 --> 01:38:53.061]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:38:53.102 --> 01:38:53.922]  That's unbelievable.
[01:38:54.222 --> 01:38:57.463]  Well, it's what's happening, and a lot of people don't know about it, and it's unfortunate.
[01:38:57.483 --> 01:39:04.365]  That's why people are going to Liberty Post and Allie Pack's website and Clown Posse and other places to be able to discuss illegal immigration.
[01:39:04.385 --> 01:39:07.346]  You can discuss it on Free Republic, but if it's something important...
[01:39:07.992 --> 01:39:16.994]  Like these signs, or something that the open borders lobby really doesn't want people talking about, it's going to get taken off of Free Republic quickly.
[01:39:18.995 --> 01:39:19.855]  And that's unfortunate.
[01:39:20.995 --> 01:39:23.836]  But over time, I think Free Republic is going to start plunging.
[01:39:24.616 --> 01:39:29.737]  I think so, because people, once again, are having to go to other alternative channels to get the news.
[01:39:30.237 --> 01:39:34.838]  If Jim Robinson of Free Republic doesn't want to put these billboards up, we know people are interested in it.
[01:39:35.138 --> 01:39:37.599]  They'll just have to go somewhere else to get the news they want.
[01:39:38.237 --> 01:39:49.846]  And again, the reason I'm talking about this, folks, is this is substantive because the alternative media is taking over, but so much of the alternative media are just disinfo agents or partisan dumbbells.
[01:39:49.866 --> 01:39:56.931]  Well, we're going to have to be careful because what if large companies like America Online and Roadrunner start filtering content?
[01:39:57.011 --> 01:39:57.932]  What are we going to do then?
[01:39:57.952 --> 01:40:01.194]  That's already been happening to InfoWars.com.
[01:40:01.555 --> 01:40:05.938]  Well, we all face that, and wherever we find it, whether it's on Free Republic or another company,
[01:40:06.497 --> 01:40:16.266]  Or any entity that is stopping the conversation, an open and honest conversation about what's happening, because that's already happening in the mainstream media.
[01:40:16.286 --> 01:40:17.507]  We're going to have to bypass it.
[01:40:17.528 --> 01:40:18.368]  We're going to have to fight it.
[01:40:18.849 --> 01:40:23.213]  And I'm a firm believer that it's easier to go over, under, and around a fence than to plow right through one.
[01:40:24.628 --> 01:40:27.209]  Let's talk about the murder of black men.
[01:40:27.229 --> 01:40:31.130]  There have been seven cases just in the last week and a half.
[01:40:31.731 --> 01:40:33.351]  Five of them dead, other two injured.
[01:40:33.731 --> 01:40:40.434]  One guy survived and reported it was four to five Hispanic males with shaved heads, the classic MS-13 sign.
[01:40:42.834 --> 01:40:45.035]  And finally, the New York Times had a report on this.
[01:40:45.415 --> 01:40:48.216]  This is like MS-13 saying they want to kill Border Patrol agents.
[01:40:48.597 --> 01:40:49.337]  This is serious.
[01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:49.757]  Comments?
[01:40:50.407 --> 01:40:52.989]  Well, I haven't read the whole news yet, and I'm learning of it now.
[01:40:53.009 --> 01:40:54.530]  I appreciate you letting me know about it.
[01:40:55.091 --> 01:41:02.417]  My first instinct would be to say that they're trying to solidify their drug market, and they're trying to take out Target.
[01:41:02.617 --> 01:41:04.999]  But this is just on the highway targeting blacks, period.
[01:41:05.900 --> 01:41:11.705]  Well, a lot of black Americans are very much right in the way of MS-13 and the people they're bringing in.
[01:41:11.745 --> 01:41:16.749]  There was a story out of Texas yesterday about the pressures in the inner city areas where the illegals
[01:41:17.287 --> 01:41:20.529]  We're taking up shop and putting pressure on black Americans to move out of the way.
[01:41:21.049 --> 01:41:26.211]  And a lot of black Americans, just like a lot of white Americans, after a shaft of twos done with us, can't afford to move.
[01:41:28.172 --> 01:41:29.073]  We can't afford to move.
[01:41:30.293 --> 01:41:44.940]  And also, these communities are... When you think America couldn't have a worse drug problem than we do, the illegal immigration that's going on is actually turning up the volume on cocaine importation and addiction issues.
[01:41:45.413 --> 01:41:48.015]  Because that's the way these poor people have a way of making money.
[01:41:48.075 --> 01:41:49.896]  Because it's illegal, it drives up the prices.
[01:41:50.216 --> 01:41:52.538]  It also paralyzes our low-skill workforce.
[01:41:53.079 --> 01:41:59.543]  And that's one of the reasons people say that they're having trouble getting Americans to work these jobs, because they're strung out on crack.
[01:41:59.763 --> 01:42:03.666]  Well, also, when you go into a lot of these inner-city areas, only one group gets hired.
[01:42:05.607 --> 01:42:13.213]  Well, they're admitting here in North Carolina, the supporters of an in-state tuition bill in the last week have said broadly, openly in the press...
[01:42:13.635 --> 01:42:19.046]  That the reason the illegal aliens are in North Carolina is because the companies are bringing them here.
[01:42:20.134 --> 01:42:21.015]  It's an open admission.
[01:42:21.095 --> 01:42:21.995]  Their message is clear.
[01:42:22.376 --> 01:42:23.336]  How does that happen?
[01:42:23.416 --> 01:42:31.162]  I mean, I know they have a dummy corporation hired who then hires the illegals so the company itself doesn't get in trouble.
[01:42:31.462 --> 01:42:35.865]  But that's clearly my favorite term, racketeering, because it shows a conspiracy.
[01:42:36.285 --> 01:42:40.268]  Well, it's showing that the companies run our life, not the government, not the people.
[01:42:40.748 --> 01:42:42.930]  And we're being told it's an open.
[01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:43.710]  It's been done.
[01:42:44.230 --> 01:42:44.751]  They're here.
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:46.701]  They're not going anywhere.
[01:42:47.061 --> 01:42:48.362]  You have no choice in the matter.
[01:42:48.742 --> 01:42:51.284]  Deal with it and pay for their health care and their education.
[01:42:52.604 --> 01:42:55.146]  Now, this has happened to our country before, Alex.
[01:42:55.226 --> 01:42:56.207]  I've said it before.
[01:42:56.867 --> 01:43:06.713]  It's happened in our past on several occasions where big business has reached these levels and the American public has risen up in a populist movement to restore the balance.
[01:43:06.753 --> 01:43:14.638]  If we do not do that, if we fail, that's the end of America and all the good things about it will be like a lot of other places around the world where
[01:43:15.270 --> 01:43:15.730]  We're good to go.
[01:43:35.051 --> 01:43:37.752]  Well, we're going to be living like the people do in Mexico and Central America.
[01:43:37.772 --> 01:43:46.315]  Well, really, the government and the corporations are just importing a group to balkanize and have a political voting bloc to veto the American people regardless of what color we are.
[01:43:46.535 --> 01:43:49.376]  Well, it may end up being a lot more than just a voting bloc, Alex.
[01:43:49.497 --> 01:43:52.758]  It might be the type of terror squads that are used in a lot of places.
[01:43:53.538 --> 01:44:03.662]  MS-13 acts a lot like terror squads and things that we saw in the late 80s in Colombia where whole villages were slaughtered with machetes by paramilitaries
[01:44:05.854 --> 01:44:07.696]  Actually, there's been a lot of connections to that.
[01:44:08.277 --> 01:44:09.719]  Well, it's a very similar tactic.
[01:44:09.779 --> 01:44:13.464]  Did you know Bush has actually hired thousands of the former death squad commanders?
[01:44:13.484 --> 01:44:14.425]  This is mainstream news.
[01:44:14.765 --> 01:44:15.847]  To send them to Iraq.
[01:44:16.227 --> 01:44:18.990]  And Negroponte, who's going to be the head of all intelligence, is now.
[01:44:19.511 --> 01:44:20.913]  He was the guy that orchestrated all that.
[01:44:23.894 --> 01:44:27.197]  Well, to be clear, it's not speculation about who ships in the narcotics.
[01:44:27.237 --> 01:44:27.938]  I've interviewed...
[01:44:52.946 --> 01:45:02.151]  More than 20 federal officers, people who were the heads of the DEA over the entire Latin America, people who were top CIA officers, they were there watching the crates of cocaine.
[01:45:02.492 --> 01:45:08.936]  Well, we do know here from North Carolina that companies have picked up the phone and called Mexico for human shipments.
[01:45:08.976 --> 01:45:10.597]  Well, that's in the amnesty plan.
[01:45:10.937 --> 01:45:18.962]  In the amnesty plan it says for six years everybody's legal who's here, and corporations can ship in skilled and unskilled workers if they have a job waiting for them.
[01:45:19.102 --> 01:45:25.506]  Well, right now the people shipping them in are MS-13 and other gangs, so that would mean companies are working with the gangs.
[01:45:25.726 --> 01:45:30.768]  I know we had a prominent Metra slash La Raza leader two years ago in Austin.
[01:45:32.069 --> 01:45:32.990]  He was a coyote.
[01:45:33.330 --> 01:45:37.092]  They got caught beating people with a baseball bat, some of the people, and he went to jail.
[01:45:37.132 --> 01:45:37.952]  But you're right.
[01:45:37.972 --> 01:45:38.893]  It's big business for them.
[01:45:39.393 --> 01:45:46.097]  Well, the truth of the matter is I'm thinking about playing a little game next week where I go play what I'm going to call Find the Boss.
[01:45:47.230 --> 01:45:52.633]  I'm going to start calling people's boss and working my way up the chain through different companies.
[01:45:53.653 --> 01:45:59.857]  And one thing I can't find on the Internet, I wish some bright person out there listening to your show would do this for America and put it on a website.
[01:46:00.357 --> 01:46:03.018]  I want to see a tree of who owns who.
[01:46:04.039 --> 01:46:07.401]  Because we have such monopolies in this country.
[01:46:07.421 --> 01:46:08.781]  We're looking at national boycotts.
[01:46:08.821 --> 01:46:15.305]  Well, if we boycott McDonald's because they're supporting open borders initiatives like fighting Proposition 200...
[01:46:16.164 --> 01:46:18.545]  Well, doesn't Pepsi or Coke own McDonald's?
[01:46:19.245 --> 01:46:20.225]  And they're on the list, too.
[01:46:20.965 --> 01:46:22.486]  And then, well, who owns Pepsi and Coke?
[01:46:23.406 --> 01:46:30.007]  And so I'm going to play a little find-the-boss game, because at this point, none of us really... If you want somebody to boycott, it's Wells Fargo.
[01:46:30.847 --> 01:46:33.208]  Well, we need to make sure that... Do you know how bad they are?
[01:46:33.588 --> 01:46:36.789]  Well, I'm just saying we may be cutting off one head of the Hydra, Alex.
[01:46:38.069 --> 01:46:38.589]  No, I agree.
[01:46:38.609 --> 01:46:40.110]  That's the problem with the monopolies.
[01:46:40.130 --> 01:46:41.370]  But let me go over this example.
[01:46:42.634 --> 01:46:45.395]  They're the guys who have got a lot of states, including Texas.
[01:46:45.715 --> 01:46:48.176]  They gave an award to the governor with Vicente Fox last year.
[01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:50.937]  And this is documented, folks.
[01:46:50.957 --> 01:46:51.657]  They came to town.
[01:46:53.237 --> 01:46:56.778]  Because the state will accept their cash cards as IDs.
[01:46:58.019 --> 01:47:02.160]  And they are the lion's share of the money transfers back to Mexico.
[01:47:02.180 --> 01:47:03.721]  They're making millions off that.
[01:47:03.761 --> 01:47:05.681]  So they're a key part of it, sir.
[01:47:06.221 --> 01:47:08.182]  Well, I want to pick some people that we can hurt.
[01:47:08.782 --> 01:47:11.223]  And by hurt, I mean hurt their sales and hurt their stock.
[01:47:11.661 --> 01:47:14.202]  And sit there and watch their stock and their sales go down.
[01:47:14.643 --> 01:47:19.805]  McDonald's Corp., just two years ago, had the first negative return since they had been created.
[01:47:20.826 --> 01:47:22.847]  And we're going to look at the whole list.
[01:47:23.207 --> 01:47:26.749]  It's time at the Alleyback website where we're starting a list of names.
[01:47:27.929 --> 01:47:36.354]  And the list of names is going to be of those individuals, organizations, and companies that we know support open borders.
[01:47:37.014 --> 01:47:40.596]  We're going to collect their names like Grover Norquist and Karl Rove.
[01:47:41.072 --> 01:47:41.533]  That's right.
[01:47:41.553 --> 01:47:43.255]  Well, we can't target General Motors Corp.
[01:47:43.775 --> 01:47:43.956]  either.
[01:47:58.695 --> 01:47:59.635]  Because what are we going to do?
[01:47:59.795 --> 01:48:03.877]  And in a lot of places, we can't target Walmart because people no longer have a choice.
[01:48:04.057 --> 01:48:07.979]  And for those that don't know, Smith & Wesson was anti-gun, pushing anti-gun agendas.
[01:48:08.699 --> 01:48:15.022]  It was British-owned, and we annihilated them, and they sold it back to an American company, and now they don't do that anymore.
[01:48:15.702 --> 01:48:17.883]  Well, I'm a firm believer in the power of consumers.
[01:48:18.504 --> 01:48:39.815]  And it'll take a lot of groups and organizations working together, but we need to limit their capacity for war, political war, in the sense that... Well, it's like they say the final nail in the coffin for Kmart was not, this has even been mainstream analysis by marketing experts, it was Rosie O'Donnell being the poster girl for Kmart, and the boycott on Kmart finally sunk them.
[01:48:40.835 --> 01:48:44.157]  Well, I think Kmart just got snapped up by Sears.
[01:48:45.445 --> 01:48:50.789]  And I don't think I can remember one merger that the SEC didn't like over the last eight years.
[01:48:51.550 --> 01:48:53.031]  All right, give us the website, sir.
[01:48:53.411 --> 01:48:56.453]  www.allypac.us.
[01:48:56.693 --> 01:48:58.195]  A lot of traffic.
[01:48:58.235 --> 01:48:58.895]  Love to see you over.
[01:48:59.295 --> 01:49:00.196]  All right, God bless you.
[01:49:00.356 --> 01:49:01.457]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[01:49:02.057 --> 01:49:06.841]  We'll come back, hit some more news, go to more of your calls, and later we'll talk about these toll roads.
[01:49:07.782 --> 01:49:10.444]  I mean, it just gets deeper and deeper what we've discovered.
[01:49:10.484 --> 01:49:10.904]  Stay with us.
[01:49:16.326 --> 01:49:23.691]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:49:23.971 --> 01:49:28.714]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:49:28.934 --> 01:49:34.618]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:49:34.818 --> 01:49:35.418]  Witness in 100 minutes.
[01:49:35.878 --> 01:49:39.361]  The execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:49:39.581 --> 01:49:46.726]  The casual society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:49:46.746 --> 01:49:51.249]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:49:51.450 --> 01:49:53.971]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[01:49:54.192 --> 01:50:00.316]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional

[01:52:20.143 --> 01:52:22.064]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:52:22.524 --> 01:52:25.285]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:33.042]  All right, I said I'd get to this yesterday.
[01:52:33.082 --> 01:52:33.502]  Never did.
[01:52:33.522 --> 01:52:35.203]  I said I'd get to it today, and I'd better.
[01:52:35.883 --> 01:52:37.824]  We've got a guest coming up in about 35 minutes.
[01:52:40.266 --> 01:52:43.247]  Vietnamese war veteran recounts horrors of prison.
[01:52:43.367 --> 01:52:48.910]  And I want to read this because it's important, and I want to illustrate how it compares to what our government's doing today.
[01:52:50.111 --> 01:52:56.494]  Also, Congress may require closer security to get a driver's license.
[01:52:58.235 --> 01:52:58.355]  And...
[01:52:59.252 --> 01:53:02.393]  Here's a spin on the new expanded national ID card.
[01:53:02.953 --> 01:53:14.736]  Cheney says Al Qaeda is still very active, but his number three man at the CIA, Buzzy Krongard, who made the money off the insider trading, he told the Times of London, we don't want to capture bin Laden, and it's come out in major publications, they're protecting him.
[01:53:15.396 --> 01:53:19.817]  Even though the guy died years ago, they're protecting his memory and not, quote, searching for him.
[01:53:20.703 --> 01:53:24.506]  I want to talk about protesters subjected to police choking and pain compliance.
[01:53:24.546 --> 01:53:26.587]  This is at Kent State University.
[01:53:27.148 --> 01:53:34.873]  And it shows the police choking peaceful protesters who are out at the soccer field just sitting on the ground singing instead of just leaving them there.
[01:53:35.273 --> 01:53:47.242]  Peaceful people there at the college who were, again, just simply... It was members of the school protesting an increase in fees.
[01:53:48.248 --> 01:53:51.490]  And here come the cops, and it shows them choking folks.
[01:53:52.111 --> 01:53:54.933]  Women twisting people's arms back.
[01:53:55.253 --> 01:53:57.294]  Then we have a link to them breaking Christians' arms.
[01:53:57.855 --> 01:54:00.096]  Just to show you, open torture, folks.
[01:54:00.496 --> 01:54:02.638]  But they call it something else, so it must be okay.
[01:54:04.279 --> 01:54:07.361]  An article here out of the Aspen Times, mainstream news.
[01:54:07.381 --> 01:54:10.583]  Then they came to the children, Homeland Security arresting children.
[01:54:10.603 --> 01:54:13.145]  And wait until you hear why they're doing it.
[01:54:13.843 --> 01:54:15.284]  Absolutely no reason.
[01:54:15.304 --> 01:54:18.365]  It is terrifying what's going on under the Patriot Act.
[01:54:18.846 --> 01:54:19.986]  That's coming up as well.
[01:54:20.747 --> 01:54:26.690]  And then, of course, we'll also talk to Ruben, Brian, Jamie, Dave, Fred, and others before our guest gets on with us.
[01:54:27.010 --> 01:54:27.930]  So I've got to hurry fast.
[01:54:29.511 --> 01:54:32.212]  Didn't really plug it last hour, so I'm going to promote it this hour.
[01:54:32.953 --> 01:54:35.254]  You've heard the caller say it's my best film ever.
[01:54:36.254 --> 01:54:37.255]  I'm very proud of it.
[01:54:38.416 --> 01:54:39.436]  And it's not going to be seen.
[01:54:39.476 --> 01:54:41.057]  It's not going to have the effect it could.
[01:54:42.121 --> 01:54:48.303]  If you get the film and don't make copies of it, please air it on local access TV stations.
[01:54:48.443 --> 01:54:49.523]  Please make copies of it.
[01:54:49.543 --> 01:54:52.424]  Please show it to your college or high school students.
[01:54:54.004 --> 01:54:54.544]  Please.
[01:54:54.784 --> 01:54:58.405]  It is so important that you get involved.
[01:54:59.346 --> 01:55:00.646]  It is so vital.
[01:55:01.146 --> 01:55:03.347]  The new film covers the latest police state developments.
[01:55:03.407 --> 01:55:08.108]  It covers how the globalists really carried out 9-11 from A to Z. We break it down and lay it out.
[01:55:09.111 --> 01:55:17.958]  And then in the third part, we show who the globalists are, their ideology, their philosophy, the Bush-Hitler connection, the Schwarzenegger connection, the skull and bones, Bohemian Grove.
[01:55:18.018 --> 01:55:29.126]  In the last ten minutes, we get into Bush giving his swearing-in ceremony, his oath, and then we show how he's violated it every step of the way, and how he's not a conservative.
[01:55:30.227 --> 01:55:32.068]  The DVD is a little over three hours.
[01:55:32.808 --> 01:55:34.970]  The VHS is two hours, 35-plus minutes.
[01:55:37.623 --> 01:55:38.523]  It's $24.95.
[01:55:38.784 --> 01:55:40.224]  The second copy is $19.95.
[01:55:40.864 --> 01:55:42.845]  The third copy is $16.95.
[01:55:42.885 --> 01:55:44.806]  The fourth copy is $14.95.
[01:55:44.846 --> 01:55:45.266]  And then down to $14.
[01:55:45.306 --> 01:55:52.789]  You can get the film I made before that one for $5.95 when you buy one copy of it for $19.95.
[01:55:52.849 --> 01:55:53.729]  American Dictators.
[01:55:53.749 --> 01:55:54.729]  And it's extremely good.
[01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:57.350]  There's always road to tyranny.
[01:55:57.390 --> 01:56:01.352]  I've got a bunch of specials going because I want to get this information out.
[01:56:01.392 --> 01:56:02.132]  So don't wait.
[01:56:02.472 --> 01:56:06.674]  Go to Infowars.com to watch lengthy clips of the films.
[01:56:07.481 --> 01:56:12.766]  And I got half of Martial Law for free, 44 minutes of American Dictators up for free.
[01:56:13.767 --> 01:56:14.768]  I want to get the material out.
[01:56:14.808 --> 01:56:18.891]  Go to Infowars.com, watch clips, read about the films, order some copies.
[01:56:19.372 --> 01:56:21.854]  Call toll-free to get them, and ask about specials when you call.
[01:56:21.874 --> 01:56:23.095]  Take advantage of those.
[01:56:23.115 --> 01:56:23.636]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:56:23.656 --> 01:56:23.876]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:56:35.337 --> 01:56:45.063]  Or you can simply write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:56:48.485 --> 01:56:51.407]  Now is the time, my friends, to get involved in the fight.
[01:56:51.688 --> 01:56:59.032]  By the way, coming up next month, we're going to have three showings of martial law at the Alamo Draft House here in Austin, Texas.
[01:56:59.532 --> 01:57:01.194]  The tales of that will be up in the next few days.
[01:57:01.294 --> 01:57:01.854]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:11.836 --> 01:57:12.517]  Big Brother.
[01:57:13.157 --> 01:57:14.237]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:14.937 --> 01:57:16.038]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:16.678 --> 01:57:17.518]  You want answers?
[01:57:18.259 --> 01:57:19.179]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:20.179 --> 01:57:23.481]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:24.001 --> 01:57:28.082]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:57:32.469 --> 01:57:37.072]  All right, I'll take a few calls right now, and I'm going to come back, cover a few news articles, go back to calls.
[01:57:37.092 --> 01:57:45.478]  We've got a guest coming up about the latest developments with the national toll roads and some of the subterfuge involved by the toll road control grid pushers.
[01:57:46.519 --> 01:57:49.821]  Now, that's coming up as well, plus more on the national ID card.
[01:57:50.362 --> 01:57:52.664]  Dick Cheney says, watch out, Al-Qaeda's going to get you.
[01:57:53.124 --> 01:57:54.105]  Ruben in Ohio.
[01:57:54.145 --> 01:57:54.785]  Welcome, Ruben.
[01:57:54.805 --> 01:57:56.046]  Hey, Alex.
[01:57:56.286 --> 01:57:58.808]  I would like to say resistance is essential.
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:01.660]  Are you there?
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:02.401]  Yes I am.
[01:58:02.581 --> 01:58:05.783]  I'm sorry, my phone died.
[01:58:06.924 --> 01:58:18.312]  I'm up here in Ohio and there's a local radio station and when Fahrenheit 9-11 came out I called the guy up and told him the actual facts of 9-11 and that I'm a conspiracy theorist and I'm a nut.
[01:58:20.230 --> 01:58:23.451]  Well, today he has Colonel Dave Hunt on, talking about his latest book, They Just Don't Get It.
[01:58:23.491 --> 01:58:26.533]  And I called up, tried to get on, and he wouldn't put me on, but this guy
[01:58:43.061 --> 01:58:52.658]  And, you know, as ignorant as I am on worldly affairs, I could have tore him apart on a number of things, just from him saying that, you know, Osama's still out there.
[01:58:53.513 --> 01:58:54.533]  And terrorists and things.
[01:58:54.573 --> 01:58:57.394]  Do you have the skinny on this Colonel Dave Hunt?
[01:58:57.434 --> 01:58:58.635]  Is he CFR or anything?
[01:58:59.055 --> 01:59:00.295]  I don't even know who he is.
[01:59:00.315 --> 01:59:05.637]  I mean, if you were able to get through or just get through on another day, you may have had too many calls to get to you.
[01:59:06.518 --> 01:59:13.060]  Call in on another day and go, well, Buzzy Crongard, the number three at the CIA, says the government doesn't want to capture bin Laden.
[01:59:13.500 --> 01:59:15.081]  And the host will go, that's ridiculous.
[01:59:15.461 --> 01:59:16.481]  And this is a challenge.
[01:59:16.501 --> 01:59:18.542]  He'll sense your confidence and won't do it.
[01:59:20.003 --> 01:59:20.663]  Say, $10,000.
[01:59:20.743 --> 01:59:24.185]  He told that to the Times of London and the Associated Press.
[01:59:24.625 --> 01:59:27.326]  And he won't take the bet, and he'll look like a fool.
[01:59:27.446 --> 01:59:28.366]  Or if he does, you'll get $10,000.
[01:59:28.406 --> 01:59:31.888]  The Times of London and the Associated Press.
[01:59:32.428 --> 01:59:32.828]  Yes, sir.
[01:59:32.848 --> 01:59:33.429]  Thanks for the call.
[01:59:33.469 --> 01:59:34.069]  Great points.
[01:59:34.469 --> 01:59:35.890]  I appreciate that call, Ruben.
[01:59:35.910 --> 01:59:36.370]  Good job.
[01:59:37.374 --> 01:59:39.736]  But, yeah, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:59:40.276 --> 01:59:41.317]  Let's talk to Brian.
[01:59:41.597 --> 01:59:43.298]  Brian, where are you calling us from?
[01:59:43.418 --> 01:59:44.579]  Hey, Alex, I'm from New Jersey.
[01:59:44.639 --> 01:59:45.599]  I call a couple of times.
[01:59:45.759 --> 01:59:46.380]  Welcome, sir.
[01:59:46.760 --> 01:59:47.440]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:59:47.741 --> 01:59:49.842]  Real quick, I'd like to praise your films.
[01:59:49.922 --> 01:59:50.342]  All of them.
[01:59:50.362 --> 01:59:54.064]  I watch at least one a day so I can rebuff my mind and see if I argue.
[01:59:54.084 --> 01:59:54.945]  Well, thank you.
[01:59:55.165 --> 01:59:55.905]  Of course.
[01:59:56.026 --> 01:59:56.726]  They're unbelievable.
[01:59:56.866 --> 02:00:02.089]  I had an interaction with the police last night, but actually you mentioned a couple of things that I'd like to talk about.
[02:00:02.109 --> 02:00:02.570]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:00:04.850 --> 02:00:10.315]  I called my mayor the other day to try and set up a town hall meeting to revoke the Patriot Act in my town.
[02:00:10.815 --> 02:00:14.078]  I was wondering the best course of action to do this.
[02:00:14.238 --> 02:00:19.362]  Well, there are about 20 different, or more than that, proposals and different plans.
[02:00:19.743 --> 02:00:21.824]  A plan I wrote up, a plan others wrote up.
[02:00:23.566 --> 02:00:25.768]  There's some other plans out there that are watered down.
[02:00:26.188 --> 02:00:29.090]  And you just print those off online, the resolutions.
[02:00:29.511 --> 02:00:30.532]  We have a form letter.
[02:00:30.552 --> 02:00:31.953]  You change the name to your town.
[02:00:32.754 --> 02:00:34.976]  And you have that form on your website?
[02:00:34.996 --> 02:00:37.818]  Yeah, it's in different versions of the law, of the resolutions, yeah.
[02:00:37.898 --> 02:00:38.458]  Okay, I can find that.
[02:00:38.498 --> 02:00:40.160]  And then the story that I had, real quick.
[02:01:00.942 --> 02:01:02.063]  Last night I was driving home.
[02:01:02.143 --> 02:01:04.445]  It was 2.30 in the morning, obviously, when all the drunks were out.
[02:01:04.505 --> 02:01:04.885]  I wasn't.
[02:01:05.526 --> 02:01:08.788]  And there was a car tailgating me real close.
[02:01:08.808 --> 02:01:09.949]  I had no idea who it was.
[02:01:10.009 --> 02:01:11.310]  I'm like, all right, this is kind of spooky.
[02:01:11.731 --> 02:01:12.211]  Pulled off.
[02:01:12.371 --> 02:01:16.254]  He pulled over onto a side road, still following me, making erratic turns all over the place.
[02:01:16.274 --> 02:01:17.956]  So I'm thinking, this guy's drunk, following me.
[02:01:17.996 --> 02:01:19.657]  No, that's on the police drive now.
[02:01:19.757 --> 02:01:20.738]  Oh, yeah, exactly.
[02:01:21.098 --> 02:01:22.039]  You got my story.
[02:01:22.079 --> 02:01:23.680]  So I pull over to the side of the road.
[02:01:23.981 --> 02:01:24.761]  He pulls up next to me.
[02:01:24.801 --> 02:01:25.202]  It's a cop.
[02:01:25.242 --> 02:01:26.183]  I'm like, oh, whatever.
[02:01:26.883 --> 02:01:27.544]  Turn off the car.
[02:01:27.584 --> 02:01:28.164]  Get out of the car.
[02:01:28.244 --> 02:01:29.465]  Make it look like, you know, I'm there.
[02:01:29.505 --> 02:01:30.366]  Like, what a jerk.
[02:01:30.808 --> 02:01:32.129]  You may be Al-Qaeda, yeah.
[02:01:32.249 --> 02:01:32.870]  Oh, yeah, of course.
[02:01:32.890 --> 02:01:33.730]  You know, I have a shaved head.
[02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:35.512]  I've already been accused of being Al-Qaeda once.
[02:01:35.532 --> 02:01:37.253]  I actually caught you about that a couple months ago.
[02:01:37.773 --> 02:01:40.936]  But he pulls us over, starts getting belligerent with me.
[02:01:40.996 --> 02:01:41.656]  I'm like, look, dude.
[02:01:42.076 --> 02:01:44.418]  Tell you what, I got Debbie coming up for about three minutes.
[02:01:45.139 --> 02:01:46.740]  Then I'll go back to you, then I'll cover news.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:47.520]  Just stay there.
[02:01:47.540 --> 02:01:48.701]  I want to hear the rest of the story.
[02:01:49.202 --> 02:01:50.362]  But real fast when we get back.
[02:01:51.143 --> 02:01:55.686]  And then we'll get to Jeremy and Dave and Fred and many others.
[02:01:56.527 --> 02:01:58.989]  We've got a lot of news and stuff to cover in a short time to...
[02:01:59.719 --> 02:02:06.865]  We're time to cover it all, so stay with us.
[02:02:07.326 --> 02:02:11.669]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:11.830 --> 02:02:16.253]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:16.414 --> 02:02:20.797]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:02:20.898 --> 02:02:22.179]  A New World Order.
[02:02:23.960 --> 02:02:28.184]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:02:28.244 --> 02:02:35.191]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:02:35.311 --> 02:02:37.393]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:02:37.513 --> 02:02:48.102]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:02:48.323 --> 02:02:48.743]  If you want
[02:02:48.763 --> 02:02:49.143]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:02:49.184 --> 02:02:50.005]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:06.705 --> 02:03:10.168]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:10.448 --> 02:03:13.951]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:14.031 --> 02:03:17.995]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:18.215 --> 02:03:24.380]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:32.687]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:03:33.087 --> 02:03:38.429]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:03:38.589 --> 02:03:42.351]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:03:42.731 --> 02:03:44.592]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[02:03:44.632 --> 02:03:46.833]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[02:03:47.053 --> 02:03:51.995]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[02:03:52.035 --> 02:03:56.137]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-
[02:03:56.937 --> 02:04:00.520]  803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:00.740 --> 02:04:04.823]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[02:04:05.384 --> 02:04:11.509]  Do you have $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 or more in credit card debt that's suffocating your bank account and your lifestyle?
[02:04:11.649 --> 02:04:16.573]  If you think bankruptcy is the only way out, then pay close attention because relief is on the way.
[02:04:16.773 --> 02:04:26.501]  Debt Relief USA at 800-509-3201 will negotiate with your creditors and settle your credit card debt for about half of what you now owe without filing bankruptcy.
[02:04:26.681 --> 02:04:31.105]  Debt Relief USA has been helping people just like you regain control of their financial future.
[02:04:31.246 --> 02:04:34.329]  In most cases, you can be debt-free in less than 36 months.
[02:04:34.589 --> 02:04:38.272]  I owed so much on my credit cards, I could barely make the minimum monthly payment.
[02:04:38.412 --> 02:04:41.375]  We talked about filing bankruptcy, but I was concerned about my credit.
[02:04:41.556 --> 02:04:43.557]  That's when I called Debt Relief USA.
[02:04:43.758 --> 02:04:47.401]  They set up a plan for me where I could settle for just 40% of what I owed.
[02:04:47.641 --> 02:04:51.245]  I'm back in control of my life, and I owe it all to Debt Relief USA.
[02:04:51.405 --> 02:04:54.686]  Call Debt Relief USA today for your free consultation.
[02:04:54.706 --> 02:04:54.786]  800-509-3201.

[02:04:56.246 --> 02:04:56.666]  Call now.
[02:04:56.686 --> 02:04:56.746]  800-509-3201.
[02:04:56.766 --> 02:04:56.807]  800-509-3201.
[02:04:56.847 --> 02:04:58.047]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:04:58.067 --> 02:04:59.687]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:17.951 --> 02:05:27.454]  All right, we're back live.
[02:05:27.494 --> 02:05:30.335]  Let's go back to your calls, and then I'm going to get into this news.
[02:05:30.575 --> 02:05:41.358]  Vietnam war veteran recounts horrors of prison and how it ties into what's happening in 2005 on multiple fronts here domestically and internationally.
[02:05:42.153 --> 02:05:43.714]  We were just talking to Brian in New Jersey.
[02:05:43.754 --> 02:05:46.636]  So, Brian, 2 o'clock in the morning, you're out driving around.
[02:05:47.276 --> 02:05:48.136]  You were telling us the story.
[02:05:48.176 --> 02:05:49.977]  There's this car right on your tail, tailgating you.
[02:05:50.017 --> 02:05:51.998]  It's driving erratically, swerving up beside you.
[02:05:52.879 --> 02:05:54.400]  Were the lights on when you pulled over?
[02:05:54.420 --> 02:05:59.523]  Okay, so I pulled over into the side street because at this point I still... But has his lights ever been on?
[02:05:59.543 --> 02:06:00.143]  No, no, no.
[02:06:00.203 --> 02:06:01.404]  His lights were not on at this point.
[02:06:01.424 --> 02:06:03.185]  He was just completely tailgating me.
[02:06:03.545 --> 02:06:04.906]  Yeah, trying to get your license number.
[02:06:05.046 --> 02:06:05.826]  Yeah, I guess.
[02:06:05.906 --> 02:06:08.407]  Whatever he was doing, he was on my butt for a long time.
[02:06:08.427 --> 02:06:10.008]  And I was a little afraid.
[02:06:10.028 --> 02:06:11.049]  I had no idea who it was.
[02:06:11.636 --> 02:06:12.096]  Pull over.
[02:06:12.116 --> 02:06:14.639]  He pulls up beside me and pulls away.
[02:06:14.739 --> 02:06:14.999]  Fine.
[02:06:15.359 --> 02:06:16.020]  I drive away.
[02:06:16.600 --> 02:06:18.762]  Finally, he pulls up behind me again.
[02:06:18.802 --> 02:06:19.863]  I guess he had nothing better to do.
[02:06:19.903 --> 02:06:21.645]  Now he puts his lights on and pulls me over.
[02:06:22.265 --> 02:06:25.188]  At this point, when he comes up to my window, he asks me why I made that turn.
[02:06:25.368 --> 02:06:27.110]  I told him exactly what I just told you.
[02:06:27.130 --> 02:06:28.651]  There was somebody on my butt.
[02:06:28.731 --> 02:06:29.872]  I didn't know what was going on.
[02:06:29.892 --> 02:06:30.673]  I was a little afraid.
[02:06:31.153 --> 02:06:33.495]  I realized it was you after I pulled over to the side of the road.
[02:06:33.816 --> 02:06:36.198]  At this point, he asks me to get out of the car and open my door.
[02:06:36.798 --> 02:06:37.439]  I asked him why.
[02:06:38.115 --> 02:06:39.296]  He said because he was the boss.
[02:06:39.636 --> 02:06:40.537]  I wanted to have a reason.
[02:06:41.377 --> 02:06:42.498]  He said, I'm the boss.
[02:06:43.519 --> 02:06:44.259]  Just like that.
[02:06:44.299 --> 02:06:46.441]  Well, don't you know, they're our owners.
[02:06:46.821 --> 02:06:48.663]  For our own good, we work for them now.
[02:06:48.703 --> 02:06:49.583]  That's called freedom.
[02:06:50.044 --> 02:06:50.384]  Oh, I know.
[02:06:50.424 --> 02:06:52.685]  Like it was in Russia and China, but go ahead.
[02:06:52.826 --> 02:06:54.507]  I was more than willing to get out of the car.
[02:06:54.567 --> 02:06:55.447]  I just wanted a reason.
[02:06:55.487 --> 02:06:56.788]  My legs were turned to the side.
[02:06:56.888 --> 02:06:57.749]  I was ready to get out.
[02:06:57.769 --> 02:07:00.151]  So the boss said, so he said, I'm the boss.
[02:07:00.471 --> 02:07:00.691]  Right.
[02:07:00.951 --> 02:07:04.734]  And I said, well, I understand that, but I'd like to know why you're asking me to get out of the car.
[02:07:04.754 --> 02:07:05.414]  But he's not the boss.
[02:07:05.435 --> 02:07:05.855]  He's the servant.
[02:07:06.155 --> 02:07:07.878]  He has to have probable cause.
[02:07:08.118 --> 02:07:08.759]  Exactly.
[02:07:09.120 --> 02:07:11.924]  They're not the authorities, the officials.
[02:07:12.165 --> 02:07:13.607]  They are servants.
[02:07:13.787 --> 02:07:14.749]  Yep.
[02:07:15.250 --> 02:07:16.692]  Notice how they changed the words though now.
[02:07:16.932 --> 02:07:18.154]  We're civilians.
[02:07:18.194 --> 02:07:19.436]  They're military.
[02:07:19.476 --> 02:07:19.777]  Go ahead.
[02:07:20.889 --> 02:07:21.790]  So I get out of the car.
[02:07:21.850 --> 02:07:23.933]  I'm still asking questions as I'm walking towards the back.
[02:07:23.993 --> 02:07:25.114]  Why am I being pulled over?
[02:07:25.154 --> 02:07:25.755]  Why am I this?
[02:07:25.795 --> 02:07:26.376]  Why am I that?
[02:07:26.656 --> 02:07:27.137]  I'm the boss.
[02:07:27.237 --> 02:07:27.677]  I'm the boss.
[02:07:27.878 --> 02:07:28.799]  He continues to do this.
[02:07:29.179 --> 02:07:30.881]  So I know that he must think I'm drunk or something.
[02:07:30.921 --> 02:07:33.945]  So just to antagonize him, I'm standing on one foot, completely balanced.
[02:07:33.965 --> 02:07:35.487]  This has to be pissing him off, but whatever.
[02:07:35.547 --> 02:07:36.688]  I'm a little pissed off myself.
[02:07:36.728 --> 02:07:37.589]  Please watch your language.
[02:07:37.609 --> 02:07:38.390]  A lot of children are listening.
[02:07:38.630 --> 02:07:39.171]  I'm sorry.
[02:07:39.231 --> 02:07:39.511]  It's all right.
[02:07:39.531 --> 02:07:39.872]  Go ahead.
[02:07:40.132 --> 02:07:40.573]  And, uh...
[02:07:41.153 --> 02:07:42.334]  He continues to question me.
[02:07:42.414 --> 02:07:43.635]  I'm answering all of his questions fine.
[02:07:43.675 --> 02:07:47.057]  As soon as he realizes that he's in the wrong, he gets completely polite with me.
[02:07:47.137 --> 02:07:47.677]  I'm sorry.
[02:07:47.897 --> 02:07:49.078]  You know, you can get back in your car.
[02:07:49.138 --> 02:07:50.879]  Gives us all of our information back and lets us go.
[02:07:50.899 --> 02:07:56.263]  But just the fact that he was tailgating me that entire time, making erratic turns.
[02:07:56.283 --> 02:07:59.225]  He drove in the other lane for two or three seconds, which is why I thought he was drunk.
[02:07:59.345 --> 02:08:01.426]  It made me just irate.
[02:08:01.446 --> 02:08:04.208]  Did you hear my story last week of the cop almost hitting me?
[02:08:04.528 --> 02:08:05.068]  No, I didn't.
[02:08:05.609 --> 02:08:07.270]  No, it's an interesting call.
[02:08:07.290 --> 02:08:08.070]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[02:08:08.110 --> 02:08:09.231]  I appreciate the call.
[02:08:10.110 --> 02:08:11.591]  Look, I'm not against police.
[02:08:11.791 --> 02:08:14.133]  I have a lot of family that are police and military.
[02:08:15.874 --> 02:08:18.296]  But that wasn't really a bad cop.
[02:08:19.376 --> 02:08:22.298]  I mean, a lot of them, if they even think they're in the wrong, they're still going to find something.
[02:08:23.379 --> 02:08:24.300]  They're going to get in your face.
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:29.243]  I've had them pull me over into stuff like that, and as soon as they realize you're not in the wrong, they are nice.
[02:08:29.823 --> 02:08:32.285]  They're pretty mean until otherwise.
[02:08:32.365 --> 02:08:34.166]  But last week, I'm driving to work.
[02:08:34.786 --> 02:08:38.149]  William Cannon, I described it as...
[02:08:39.508 --> 02:08:43.252]  Well, great white sharks feeding on tuna, but really great whites don't do that.
[02:08:43.292 --> 02:08:45.374]  Maybe blue thrasher sharks.
[02:08:46.215 --> 02:08:54.584]  They'll swarm around and get people on the fish in a group and then just streak through them, gobbling them.
[02:08:56.006 --> 02:09:00.330]  A better analogy would be fish in a barrel, as long as we're using the aquatic example.
[02:09:02.626 --> 02:09:05.169]  Every morning, I drive exactly 40 miles an hour.
[02:09:05.189 --> 02:09:08.111]  There are motorcycle cops, squad cars.
[02:09:08.191 --> 02:09:10.513]  I mean, you talk about speed trap, this place should be on the map.
[02:09:12.215 --> 02:09:13.176]  All of William Cannon.
[02:09:14.197 --> 02:09:17.780]  I mean, it just goes on and on, and they're just pulling people over left and right, so I'm always going 40.
[02:09:18.941 --> 02:09:27.049]  And I've seen cops pull out from behind trees and pull out from the grass and pull out from behind stores and drive somewhat recklessly, but this cop car jumps.
[02:09:28.559 --> 02:09:39.307]  Out, from behind some trees, there's just a sidewalk of trees, just flies out, I mean 10, 15 feet, folks, from cars going 45 miles an hour, would chase a pickup truck in to give him a ticket.
[02:09:41.008 --> 02:09:41.868]  Because that guy was going like 50.
[02:09:42.809 --> 02:09:49.834]  And I'm back behind this, and these cars in front of me all swerve, they almost hit each other, and I'm like, you know, if I did that, I'd get in trouble.
[02:09:52.146 --> 02:09:56.550]  And I've had police, when they're running my plates, there's no reason to get right up on my tail.
[02:09:56.570 --> 02:09:57.771]  I get to see how I'm going to act.
[02:09:58.392 --> 02:10:00.173]  Right up, you know, on my hind end.
[02:10:01.154 --> 02:10:04.417]  And I've seen them with other people, you know, pull up beside them, look at them, whatever.
[02:10:05.318 --> 02:10:12.304]  And there are like these Billy Bad Boy type individuals that in the past they would not put up with.
[02:10:12.725 --> 02:10:15.627]  Police forces would not put up with this type of unprofessional behavior.
[02:10:16.929 --> 02:10:18.450]  And this guy could have killed people.
[02:10:19.045 --> 02:10:19.965]  He could have killed himself.
[02:10:19.985 --> 02:10:20.986]  I mean, jumping out.
[02:10:21.046 --> 02:10:21.966]  I mean, literally, folks.
[02:10:22.346 --> 02:10:24.167]  This squad car just exploded.
[02:10:25.988 --> 02:10:29.349]  Spewing grass like it's a hazard or something.
[02:10:30.890 --> 02:10:31.810]  What was the guy's name?
[02:10:31.830 --> 02:10:32.731]  One of them was Enos.
[02:10:33.271 --> 02:10:35.292]  Sheriff Roscoe P. Coltrane.
[02:10:35.712 --> 02:10:36.172]  That's right.
[02:10:37.032 --> 02:10:40.774]  He might have had flash in the front of the seat with him.
[02:10:41.234 --> 02:10:43.595]  I mean, look, you need somebody to tell you to stop it.
[02:10:44.341 --> 02:10:49.484]  Because let me tell you, you were the one that was going to get T-boned by that Silverado that almost hit you.
[02:10:51.686 --> 02:10:53.887]  And those are the most dangerous type of accidents, they say.
[02:10:54.648 --> 02:10:57.490]  So, statistically, I'm not against you.
[02:10:57.570 --> 02:11:00.372]  I mean, somebody needs to put you back in your place.
[02:11:02.593 --> 02:11:05.515]  I mean, it's not my place to be jumping out in front of cars.
[02:11:06.216 --> 02:11:08.017]  Frankly, if I was a police officer...
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:15.946]  And I saw somebody, a civilian as you call us, pull out in front of someone consciously like that.
[02:11:16.987 --> 02:11:18.708]  And I pulled them over and I said, did you do that on purpose?
[02:11:18.748 --> 02:11:19.769]  And they said, yes, I'd arrest them.
[02:11:20.189 --> 02:11:23.332]  Now, it was a mistake and they weren't looking and they were idiots, so you better be careful.
[02:11:23.772 --> 02:11:27.656]  But, I mean, if I was a police officer, I would have arrested someone doing that.
[02:11:28.036 --> 02:11:29.297]  That was reckless driving.
[02:11:30.498 --> 02:11:32.159]  See, I don't believe there should be speed laws.
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:34.141]  They don't have that in Europe, most areas.
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:36.800]  But you recklessly drive, you're going to jail.
[02:11:37.060 --> 02:11:42.022]  I believe that you should be arrested for recklessly driving because that's endangering people's lives.
[02:11:44.002 --> 02:11:46.643]  And I'm going to tell you, the worst driving I see out there is police.
[02:11:46.683 --> 02:11:47.483]  And I'm tired of it.
[02:11:47.503 --> 02:11:53.384]  People in my family and this cop car and just zooms right around you.
[02:11:53.664 --> 02:11:55.965]  And then zooms up and the lights aren't even on.
[02:11:58.145 --> 02:12:01.326]  I mean, it's one thing if they've got some killer robbing a bank or something.
[02:12:02.166 --> 02:12:04.627]  All right, now see, I've just burned too much time there.
[02:12:05.461 --> 02:12:06.121]  Telling that story.
[02:12:06.141 --> 02:12:07.342]  Your calls will come up in a few minutes.
[02:12:09.383 --> 02:12:10.684]  Let me jump into this news here.
[02:12:11.984 --> 02:12:12.524]  This is News 8.
[02:12:12.805 --> 02:12:15.746]  I read this over the weekend, and I have researched this.
[02:12:15.906 --> 02:12:18.507]  This is an accurate report, News 8, Austin.
[02:12:19.368 --> 02:12:22.449]  Vietnamese war veteran recounts horrors of prison.
[02:12:23.690 --> 02:12:32.514]  The University of Texas Vietnamese Student Association observed the 30th anniversary of the fall of Saigon on Saturday with a banquet and a vigil called Black April.
[02:12:33.999 --> 02:12:37.981]  The phone marks the day the United States pulled out of Vietnam, ending the war.
[02:12:39.302 --> 02:12:44.424]  The event's keynote speaker was a Vietnamese war veteran who witnessed many atrocities during the war.
[02:12:45.825 --> 02:12:55.810]  Michael Du spent six years in the Vietnamese military forces, and even though the horror of the war still lingers in his memory, it was what happened afterward that forever changed his life.
[02:12:56.946 --> 02:13:04.170]  One month after April 30th, they broadcast on radio and television for all of the officers to go to what they called a new school.
[02:13:05.051 --> 02:13:08.933]  To learn to study the new policy, but actually it was a prison, Dew said.
[02:13:08.953 --> 02:13:10.714]  It's like our public schools are becoming.
[02:13:11.474 --> 02:13:18.519]  At age 28, after serving six years in the infantry and air force, and having seen and done so many things, Dew was made a prisoner.
[02:13:19.559 --> 02:13:24.462]  And what was supposed to be a 10-day re-education turned into 10 years of torture and starvation.
[02:13:25.532 --> 02:13:29.174]  We had only two spoons of rice a day and nothing else but salt water for a whole year.
[02:13:30.714 --> 02:13:40.338]  Those were only three times we had a little piece of meat, no vegetables, and that's all we had for a whole year, and we survived on catching whatever move, he said, like bugs and lizards.
[02:13:42.239 --> 02:13:45.241]  I've interviewed vets who were in there for like five, six years, and that's what they'd eat.
[02:13:45.721 --> 02:13:47.522]  Roaches, they never said more delicious.
[02:13:48.162 --> 02:13:52.844]  Life became so excruciating and Du worried about his family so much that
[02:13:53.576 --> 02:13:54.037]  We're good to go.
[02:13:54.097 --> 02:13:54.317]  I think?
[02:14:01.941 --> 02:14:08.165]  I think nothing about them because you think and you finally, you can't help them, Dew said.
[02:14:08.205 --> 02:14:11.848]  Finally, ten years later and after enduring so much, Dew was finally released.
[02:14:11.888 --> 02:14:12.908]  But he still wasn't free.
[02:14:13.268 --> 02:14:15.550]  They still watched my every movement, he said.
[02:14:16.150 --> 02:14:18.412]  In 1990, Dew brought his entire family to the United States.
[02:14:18.752 --> 02:14:21.093]  It was his first taste of freedom and of a new life.
[02:14:21.434 --> 02:14:23.395]  It's like from hell to heaven.
[02:14:23.775 --> 02:14:26.916]  When I stepped on that soil May 9, 1990, I felt reborn.
[02:14:27.216 --> 02:14:29.437]  I got a new life, he said, since moving to the United States.
[02:14:29.817 --> 02:14:36.359]  He has worked for the CIA counterterrorism program and received his bachelor's degree in engineering and a master's in management.
[02:14:36.699 --> 02:14:40.040]  Dew and his family now own a dry cleaning business in Pflugerville.
[02:14:41.020 --> 02:14:42.841]  I want to get Mr. Dew on the broadcast.
[02:14:43.444 --> 02:14:44.524]  I wonder if he'll come on, though.
[02:14:44.544 --> 02:14:49.445]  He'll probably research who I am and decide he better not or he might lose his job at the CIA.
[02:14:49.545 --> 02:14:54.106]  Does Mr. Do have to do some things that might be bad to keep us safe from the commies?
[02:14:55.666 --> 02:14:56.626]  It's all the same system.
[02:14:56.666 --> 02:14:57.727]  It's all command and control.
[02:14:58.067 --> 02:14:59.167]  I'm sure he's a great guy.
[02:14:59.187 --> 02:15:01.367]  I'm going to try to get him on.
[02:15:01.387 --> 02:15:04.308]  But look at America.
[02:15:04.328 --> 02:15:11.409]  I mean, I have video on my website right now of tanks being used on protesters in L.A.,
[02:15:12.427 --> 02:15:23.537]  I have articles on my website right now that show, out in the open, what went on at a major university.
[02:15:24.258 --> 02:15:28.922]  Boy, I knocked that microphone almost across the room trying to find the article.
[02:15:30.444 --> 02:15:33.887]  And they're choking the people.
[02:15:35.048 --> 02:15:37.991]  They're protesting their tuition going up, sitting in the soccer fields,
[02:15:38.689 --> 02:15:51.664]  And they say you're not allowed to have a protest, so they march over and it's just, it goes on and on as they bend hands until they're at the point of breaking, bend wrists as they grab young women, men in black uniforms, with black gloves, choking them.
[02:15:51.884 --> 02:15:53.806]  The young women pass out and they fall on the ground.
[02:15:54.047 --> 02:15:56.670]  When they wake up, the cops begin choking them again.
[02:15:56.690 --> 02:15:58.552]  I mean, choking people.
[02:15:59.292 --> 02:16:01.753]  And it's, well, this is a compliance move we use.
[02:16:02.013 --> 02:16:02.794]  It's not torture.
[02:16:03.374 --> 02:16:05.095]  It's like Alberto Gonzalez in his memos.
[02:16:05.115 --> 02:16:06.295]  He says, we can torture people.
[02:16:06.576 --> 02:16:09.977]  He says, we can't put stress on people until organs fail and they die.
[02:16:10.457 --> 02:16:12.679]  If we didn't kill them on purpose, it's not even torture.
[02:16:13.399 --> 02:16:14.579]  Now, that's in the public memo.
[02:16:16.080 --> 02:16:17.681]  Raping women in front of their husbands.
[02:16:17.761 --> 02:16:18.601]  Raping children.
[02:16:19.542 --> 02:16:22.143]  Raping people with huge objects dripping with battery acid.
[02:16:22.223 --> 02:16:24.064]  I mean, this is what the Army admits?
[02:16:24.944 --> 02:16:25.945]  Battery acid?
[02:16:26.225 --> 02:16:27.866]  Jeffrey Dahmer did that!
[02:16:29.444 --> 02:16:29.944]  Acid!
[02:16:31.845 --> 02:16:38.289]  I mean, and it's perverted, it's sick, and this is the exact type of garbage the North Vietnamese did.
[02:16:38.869 --> 02:16:39.830]  And I've talked to people.
[02:16:40.470 --> 02:16:41.831]  I have friends this happened to.
[02:16:43.112 --> 02:16:45.413]  Okay, they did this to thousands of our people.
[02:16:46.474 --> 02:16:48.595]  And our government did it too in Operation Phoenix.
[02:16:49.175 --> 02:16:55.739]  And the excuse was, well, we've got to do this because we're fighting them and they do it.
[02:16:56.676 --> 02:16:59.140]  See, when you start doing that, then it becomes mainstream.
[02:17:02.045 --> 02:17:02.586]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:02.747 --> 02:17:04.289]  We'll be right back with more news, more calls.
[02:17:08.524 --> 02:17:14.046]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:17:14.206 --> 02:17:15.267]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:17:15.387 --> 02:17:16.247]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:17:16.367 --> 02:17:19.208]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:17:19.388 --> 02:17:24.270]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:17:24.531 --> 02:17:25.611]  Check out this new product.
[02:17:25.771 --> 02:17:28.652]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:17:29.032 --> 02:17:32.734]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:17:32.894 --> 02:17:33.054]  Look.
[02:17:33.254 --> 02:17:35.557]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.
[02:17:35.637 --> 02:17:40.463]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[02:17:40.763 --> 02:17:43.887]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[02:17:43.987 --> 02:17:49.413]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:17:49.493 --> 02:17:50.254]  Try Nobio.
[02:17:50.374 --> 02:17:51.356]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:17:52.517 --> 02:17:55.418]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:17:55.599 --> 02:17:58.460]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:01.121]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[02:18:01.301 --> 02:18:04.583]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NoBO.
[02:18:04.763 --> 02:18:05.483]  That's no-bo.com.
[02:18:08.027 --> 02:18:09.648]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:18:09.788 --> 02:18:13.889]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:18:14.030 --> 02:18:16.911]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:18:16.991 --> 02:18:23.694]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:18:23.874 --> 02:18:26.895]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:18:27.095 --> 02:18:29.496]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:18:29.616 --> 02:18:34.258]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:18:34.258 --> 02:18:35.358]  We're good to go.
[02:18:58.888 --> 02:18:59.608]  We're good to go.
[02:18:59.688 --> 02:19:00.428]  We're good to go.
[02:19:00.448 --> 02:19:01.009]  We're good to go.
[02:19:23.574 --> 02:19:36.864]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Ruling 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:37.384 --> 02:19:42.688]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:19:42.989 --> 02:19:48.893]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[02:19:49.514 --> 02:19:49.574]  1-800-686-2237
[02:20:07.754 --> 02:20:10.157]  Pope John II is already being acclaimed a saint.
[02:20:10.277 --> 02:20:13.461]  During his 26 years, he's canonized 482 saints.
[02:20:13.561 --> 02:20:18.527]  The one saint that stands out in my mind is Saint Maria Faustina, a poor, uneducated Polish nun.
[02:20:18.667 --> 02:20:24.314]  Christ appeared to her over 100 times in the 1930s and instructed her to keep a diary of the message he wanted to give to the world.
[02:20:24.394 --> 02:20:30.375]  This message is nothing new, just a reminder of what the Church has always taught, that God is merciful and forgiving, excluding no one.
[02:20:30.635 --> 02:20:34.676]  And if we too must show mercy and forgiveness to our neighbor, Christ has asked us to honor His mercy.
[02:20:34.876 --> 02:20:36.817]  In return, Christ promises to take care of you.
[02:20:36.877 --> 02:20:39.957]  Christ will grant unimaginable favors to those that trust in His mercy.
[02:20:40.097 --> 02:20:40.717]  Trust Jesus.
[02:20:40.897 --> 02:20:42.938]  He will reveal His love in all aspects of your life.
[02:20:43.118 --> 02:20:46.999]  I've experienced the power of divine mercy and know the miracles that have taken place in my life.
[02:20:47.139 --> 02:20:49.559]  Christ will pour out His mercy and love to you in great abundance.
[02:20:49.819 --> 02:20:53.040]  I'm offering you a free booklet so that you too can learn more about divine mercy.
[02:20:53.200 --> 02:20:53.320]  Woo!
[02:20:53.340 --> 02:20:53.400]  Woo!
[02:21:21.546 --> 02:21:23.207]  I've got the article here in front of me.
[02:21:24.487 --> 02:21:27.388]  You can go watch the video at prisonplanet.com.
[02:21:28.128 --> 02:21:32.089]  Protesters subjected to police choking, pain compliance.
[02:21:33.309 --> 02:21:40.671]  After 10th State University education, the protesters refused to leave a field and wanted to camp there for the night.
[02:21:41.131 --> 02:21:44.152]  Police used chokeholds and pain compliance to disperse them.
[02:21:44.921 --> 02:21:46.401]  Just like Tiananmen Square, folks.
[02:21:46.921 --> 02:21:51.342]  I mean, they're there protesting the massive increases in fees.
[02:21:52.803 --> 02:21:55.583]  They're on the property of the school they're paying to be there.
[02:21:55.603 --> 02:21:57.984]  And you ought to see this footage.
[02:21:59.284 --> 02:22:01.284]  And there's other links, and there's hours of this.
[02:22:01.424 --> 02:22:04.965]  I mean, they'll choke a woman, a young woman, until she passes out, and then start choking her again.
[02:22:04.985 --> 02:22:08.326]  As soon as they pass out, they let go.
[02:22:08.346 --> 02:22:11.027]  I'm sure they'll soon just start killing you.
[02:22:11.047 --> 02:22:13.187]  Just put a tourniquet, go ahead and haul you up on a line.
[02:22:13.829 --> 02:22:17.710]  Be a bunch of dead bodies hanging up and they'll say, this is freedom, we're helping the civilians.
[02:22:18.370 --> 02:22:19.190]  The civilians.
[02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:20.750]  You're civilians too, you idiots.
[02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:22.451]  But go watch it.
[02:22:22.571 --> 02:22:25.271]  I mean, men in black gloves just choking women.
[02:22:25.771 --> 02:22:27.372]  I got footage in Seattle where they do that.
[02:22:27.412 --> 02:22:29.112]  Some woman's got a sign peacefully standing there.
[02:22:29.312 --> 02:22:30.352]  Don't protest aloud.
[02:22:30.392 --> 02:22:33.093]  Walk over, start choking her.
[02:22:33.813 --> 02:22:35.513]  It's freedom, it's America.
[02:22:36.153 --> 02:22:37.553]  I mean, just how sick is that?
[02:22:38.334 --> 02:22:40.494]  It's so obvious that it's pure evil.
[02:22:42.506 --> 02:22:45.127]  And man, these prisons, they torture the daylights out of people.
[02:22:45.687 --> 02:22:50.168]  They basically feed them rotten food unless they agree to have medical testing done on them.
[02:22:50.968 --> 02:22:53.749]  It's just all these evils going on that we just accept.
[02:22:55.950 --> 02:23:03.832]  But if you think it's bad of these leftists, which is wrong, we've got them breaking Christians' arms with nunchucks, twisting.
[02:23:04.472 --> 02:23:05.132]  I'm going to break it.
[02:23:05.212 --> 02:23:05.812]  I'm going to break it.
[02:23:05.853 --> 02:23:06.333]  All right.
[02:23:06.713 --> 02:23:07.153]  All right.
[02:23:07.193 --> 02:23:08.593]  That's part of the compliance.
[02:23:08.873 --> 02:23:10.494]  The arms, you know, that does a 180.
[02:23:13.081 --> 02:23:14.782]  Compound fractures, you name it.
[02:23:14.882 --> 02:23:17.163]  It's all part of freedom, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:23:17.383 --> 02:23:18.964]  Breaking people's arms.
[02:23:19.024 --> 02:23:21.825]  I mean, on purpose.
[02:23:21.965 --> 02:23:24.326]  And then federal courts saying, yeah, we can do that.
[02:23:24.426 --> 02:23:25.127]  No, you can't.
[02:23:26.447 --> 02:23:28.188]  Gonzales says, Bush is above the law.
[02:23:28.268 --> 02:23:40.494]  He says, and then you've got the stuff going on at Camp X-Ray, the stuff going on in Gitmo, the stuff going on in Abu Ghraib and 30-plus other camps in Iraq.
[02:23:41.212 --> 02:23:42.973]  I mean, it is brutal stuff.
[02:23:44.174 --> 02:23:51.100]  In the Army's own reports, 75 to 90 percent of the people at those camps were families picked up at checkpoints.
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:55.123]  They think you steal a stick of wood, they bulldoze your car, take you to the camp.
[02:23:56.364 --> 02:23:57.145]  And it's admitted.
[02:23:57.585 --> 02:23:59.266]  This isn't going to win the hearts and minds.
[02:23:59.366 --> 02:24:03.790]  It's to create a warped group of soldiers that will come back here and be our police.
[02:24:05.583 --> 02:24:11.346]  I mean, you've lost your soul out there if you think that's normal, raping some man's wife in front of him.
[02:24:12.707 --> 02:24:14.548]  If you think that's normal, you're sick.
[02:24:16.129 --> 02:24:19.911]  I mean, even, I thought sickos even knew it was bad, but no, they think it's good.
[02:24:19.951 --> 02:24:21.352]  They're sicker than sick.
[02:24:21.892 --> 02:24:22.992]  They're pure evil.
[02:24:24.493 --> 02:24:26.354]  Battery acid, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:27.675 --> 02:24:29.436]  And I can't say any more than that on air.
[02:24:30.757 --> 02:24:33.539]  I mean, we're talking about, and that stuff spills over.
[02:24:33.559 --> 02:24:34.479]  You know, look at New York.
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:39.062]  A cop thinks somebody threw a punch at him, so he's going to torture you for two hours with a toilet plunger.
[02:24:39.543 --> 02:24:41.384]  I mean, where does stuff like that come from?
[02:24:42.905 --> 02:24:45.767]  And finally, good cop with a whistle, and it was two hours.
[02:24:46.327 --> 02:24:47.788]  How do you continually?
[02:24:49.149 --> 02:24:51.511]  That's hard to do, even for a psychopath.
[02:24:52.551 --> 02:24:53.412]  I mean, that's work.
[02:24:54.969 --> 02:24:58.790]  You've got to be from a really sick place in yourself to be able to do that.
[02:24:58.850 --> 02:25:00.531]  I mean, what happened to this country?
[02:25:01.031 --> 02:25:07.172]  Every smart psychopath and nutcase and control freak bully has gone and joined the police force and the military.
[02:25:07.652 --> 02:25:12.774]  And most of them aren't bad, but the evil ones are in there, and they're getting promoted by the evil ones that are in control.
[02:25:13.594 --> 02:25:16.615]  We're in a process of being warped right now.
[02:25:17.755 --> 02:25:19.156]  David, Illinois, welcome, sir.
[02:25:21.736 --> 02:25:22.416]  Go ahead, Dave.
[02:25:22.436 --> 02:25:24.277]  Oof.
[02:25:24.966 --> 02:25:25.546]  Dave, go ahead.
[02:25:26.147 --> 02:25:26.367]  Me?
[02:25:26.767 --> 02:25:27.348]  Yes, you.
[02:25:27.748 --> 02:25:29.569]  Oh, well, it's actually Mike, but thanks.
[02:25:29.789 --> 02:25:30.390]  Hey, I apologize.
[02:25:30.410 --> 02:25:32.151]  You got the wrong name, Mike, but it doesn't matter.
[02:25:32.171 --> 02:25:32.731]  You're on the air.
[02:25:32.811 --> 02:25:33.311]  That's all right.
[02:25:33.331 --> 02:25:33.892]  I appreciate it.
[02:25:33.912 --> 02:25:35.073]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:25:35.093 --> 02:25:38.074]  I actually got 9-11 Rise of the Police State from you.
[02:25:38.175 --> 02:25:43.178]  I've made about six copies, and I just keep them in circulation to everybody that I know.
[02:25:43.198 --> 02:25:49.041]  I want to talk about the toll thing real quick, if you've got two seconds.
[02:25:49.061 --> 02:25:49.682]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:25:49.762 --> 02:25:54.445]  We had Governor Ryan here, who was, as they do so well in the media...
[02:25:55.563 --> 02:26:02.865]  Politically assassinated because a piece of a trailer broke off of a semi dribbling through Michigan or something.
[02:26:02.885 --> 02:26:07.507]  It went through a minivan, killed seven people, and they went after the former governor of the state for that.
[02:26:08.867 --> 02:26:18.230]  Well, I live here, and I've paid attention pretty closely since I started to approach voting age to what was going on since it's my duty as an American to participate.
[02:26:19.325 --> 02:26:23.508]  Um, he was really after removing the tolls in the state of Illinois.
[02:26:23.548 --> 02:26:24.969]  He had a plan to remove the tolls.
[02:26:25.130 --> 02:26:26.150]  I knew that, yeah.
[02:26:26.170 --> 02:26:29.193]  Over 20 years, and all of a sudden, this occurs, and they go after him.
[02:26:29.233 --> 02:26:34.757]  It would be like going after the owner of McDonald's for some kid selling marijuana out of a drive-thru window.
[02:26:35.357 --> 02:26:37.018]  But it's a good little issue for people.
[02:26:37.079 --> 02:26:37.699]  I remember that.
[02:26:38.239 --> 02:26:39.360]  What a little mindless symbol.
[02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:40.481]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:26:40.521 --> 02:26:41.662]  I'll let you finish up on the other side.
[02:26:41.682 --> 02:26:42.963]  This is important.
[02:26:43.635 --> 02:26:48.737]  For those that don't know, in Illinois, they double the prices of the tolls overnight.
[02:26:49.237 --> 02:26:53.659]  Unless you get the transponder, then it's half price.
[02:26:57.821 --> 02:26:58.721]  We're on the march.
[02:26:59.202 --> 02:27:00.842]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:01.723 --> 02:27:04.424]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:09.924 --> 02:27:15.405]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:15.825 --> 02:27:20.066]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:20.286 --> 02:27:27.328]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:27:27.708 --> 02:27:33.810]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:27:33.950 --> 02:27:35.170]  There are no side effects.
[02:27:35.230 --> 02:27:35.831]  We're good to go.
[02:27:52.288 --> 02:27:55.433]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[02:28:07.384 --> 02:28:13.651]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:13.771 --> 02:28:19.937]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:20.217 --> 02:28:28.606]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:28:28.886 --> 02:28:35.932]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:28:36.213 --> 02:28:41.057]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:28:41.257 --> 02:28:50.065]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs, ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:28:50.425 --> 02:28:58.330]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:06.897 --> 02:29:08.579]  Been a while since you've seen the dentist?
[02:29:08.779 --> 02:29:09.640]  Kids need braces?
[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:11.061]  Can't afford dental care?

[02:29:57.880 --> 02:30:10.108]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:30:10.688 --> 02:30:13.570]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:15.271 --> 02:30:24.897]  Alright, here in just a minute I'm going to go back to Mike in Illinois who noticed that as soon as their governor came out against toll roads he got thrown out of office real quick and demonized.
[02:30:25.942 --> 02:30:31.624]  Then we'll talk about just the type of corruption we're facing in Central Texas fighting the national toll roads.
[02:30:31.744 --> 02:30:34.485]  And the feds admit we're the center of the fight.
[02:30:34.505 --> 02:30:36.526]  This is coming to a town near you if it isn't already there.
[02:30:37.886 --> 02:30:39.327]  Before we do that, two announcements.
[02:30:40.847 --> 02:30:41.927]  It should be up tomorrow.
[02:30:41.987 --> 02:30:44.008]  If not tomorrow, it should be up by Thursday.
[02:30:44.028 --> 02:30:55.432]  I have shown 9-11, the road to tyranny, twice in Austin and twice in Houston.
[02:30:56.542 --> 02:30:59.343]  And one time we showed it in Houston, we turned away 200 people.
[02:31:00.864 --> 02:31:01.184]  Literally.
[02:31:01.665 --> 02:31:04.686]  The next time, it only filled up about 85% of the theater, so you never know.
[02:31:05.406 --> 02:31:07.448]  Here in Austin, it sold out both times.
[02:31:08.368 --> 02:31:20.254]  So to fix that problem, June 3rd, Friday, June 3rd, at their big, nice downtown theater, and they will be serving food and drinks and all that, because that's what they do at night down there.
[02:31:20.274 --> 02:31:21.214]  Really nice.
[02:31:21.535 --> 02:31:23.175]  Your own table there to watch the movie.
[02:31:23.796 --> 02:31:25.637]  I'll be showing it at 7 o'clock.
[02:31:25.677 --> 02:31:26.097]  That means...
[02:31:27.234 --> 02:31:30.497]  7 to 7.30 I'll be speaking, then we'll play the film and have a question and answer.
[02:31:30.998 --> 02:31:34.741]  Then at 10 o'clock I'm going to speak again and have another showing.
[02:31:35.121 --> 02:31:47.252]  Two showings so we can make sure that everybody that comes, you know, if you wanted to buy tickets at the door and you showed up and it was sold out for the first showing, you'd buy one for the second showing and go take your wife to dinner and come back to the 10 o'clock showing.
[02:31:48.869 --> 02:31:55.817]  And then we're going to, the next Wednesday, the 8th of June, show it at their South Lamar location, which is an even bigger theater.
[02:31:55.837 --> 02:31:57.700]  It's a five-screen theater and really nice.
[02:31:58.060 --> 02:32:00.042]  They have like a gourmet chef at that one.
[02:32:00.703 --> 02:32:02.766]  I sneak out every couple weeks and go there and...
[02:32:04.043 --> 02:32:05.264]  We're good to go.
[02:32:26.846 --> 02:32:31.208]  We're in San Antonio and all over in Houston and Austin and popping up.
[02:32:31.628 --> 02:32:33.969]  It's getting real popular and the owner is a fan.
[02:32:34.749 --> 02:32:37.930]  And I may be going all over to different Alamos around Texas showing the film.
[02:32:38.711 --> 02:32:50.095]  But I want this to be really successful and I want to see everybody out there and I'll be there with my books and tapes and films and all that great stuff and I'll be giving speeches and taking your questions.
[02:32:51.702 --> 02:32:52.623]  Be sure and get ready for that.
[02:32:52.943 --> 02:33:06.150]  If you want a hard copy of Marshal Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State, my newest film, my best film, it's really a miniseries, covers the police state, 9-11, and the globalist Nazi connection and the occult connection.
[02:33:07.411 --> 02:33:08.571]  It's such an important film.
[02:33:08.591 --> 02:33:09.732]  Please call toll-free to get it.
[02:33:09.752 --> 02:33:10.292]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:10.312 --> 02:33:10.372]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:20.442 --> 02:33:28.747]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:33:32.229 --> 02:33:36.252]  Or you can go to prisonplanet.tv and watch all 12 of my films.
[02:33:36.732 --> 02:33:40.734]  Dozens of other films have been authorized to post by other great researchers and authors.
[02:33:41.135 --> 02:33:49.920]  My book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV report, special reports that are only on the website, that aren't even on the TV show, hundreds of audio interviews, Prison Planet.
[02:33:50.481 --> 02:33:51.221]  We're good to go.
[02:34:20.265 --> 02:34:22.446]  Double toll if you don't get the transponder.
[02:34:22.966 --> 02:34:27.828]  So two million people the first day lined up to get their transponders.
[02:34:27.848 --> 02:34:30.689]  And here in the state of Texas, they're not going to give us a choice.
[02:34:30.729 --> 02:34:35.531]  The bill's in there to put transponders in every car via the inspection sticker in 06.
[02:34:35.611 --> 02:34:38.272]  But finish up your comments, Mike.
[02:34:38.332 --> 02:34:40.433]  We're obedient sheeple in the state of Illinois.
[02:34:41.493 --> 02:34:48.236]  One of the things, and I've really been outspoken for a lot of years on a lot of different issues that I don't feel are just
[02:34:48.900 --> 02:34:54.964]  I've been ridiculed tremendously for it, and I really appreciate you having the medium that you have and using it the way you do.
[02:34:55.464 --> 02:34:59.406]  I just want to make one more quick question, or one more statement in closing.
[02:35:00.767 --> 02:35:16.316]  I stick my neck out a lot when I talk to people, and I had a conversation yesterday with a woman who went to Yugoslavia during communism, and she said she asked people what the deal was with all the armed guards and the soldiers with their machine guns, and they passed it off as that was protection for the people.
[02:35:16.889 --> 02:35:17.590]  Oh, it's always.
[02:35:17.630 --> 02:35:20.291]  It wasn't because we're authoritarian and abusive.
[02:35:20.331 --> 02:35:21.272]  It's for your safety.
[02:35:21.292 --> 02:35:22.673]  There's terrorists.
[02:35:22.833 --> 02:35:29.537]  What bothers me, and I don't understand where the breakdown in the American psyche, and this is the last thing I'll say, and God bless you, Alex.
[02:35:29.577 --> 02:35:30.938]  Thank you so much for what you do.
[02:35:31.978 --> 02:35:39.803]  We've made it through two nuclear wars, or two world wars, the threat of nuclear annihilation, the Cold War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, all of that.
[02:35:40.399 --> 02:35:45.440]  And never in this country's history have we ever taken the rights away from everyone.
[02:35:45.620 --> 02:35:47.361]  And they always said fear not.
[02:35:47.441 --> 02:35:49.501]  Now it's fear, fear, give all your rights up!
[02:35:49.801 --> 02:35:52.762]  I don't understand why that's happening, Alex, but we've got to stop it.
[02:35:53.062 --> 02:35:55.103]  Well, the globalists said before 9-11.
[02:35:55.263 --> 02:35:57.463]  I'll stand next to you all the way down the ship.
[02:35:57.683 --> 02:35:58.103]  It doesn't matter.
[02:35:58.123 --> 02:35:58.724]  Thank you, my friend.
[02:35:58.764 --> 02:35:59.464]  God bless you, Mike.
[02:35:59.484 --> 02:36:00.684]  Take care and keep up the good work.
[02:36:01.704 --> 02:36:06.305]  Look, how did I know they were about to attack the World Trade Center?
[02:36:06.325 --> 02:36:08.586]  Because the feds cooked the bomb and trained the driver the first time.
[02:36:09.949 --> 02:36:10.449]  That's admitted, 93.
[02:36:12.250 --> 02:36:15.852]  Because they were on the news going, here's Bin Laden, he's about to attack you.
[02:36:15.872 --> 02:36:17.473]  We're going to take your rights when this happens.
[02:36:17.913 --> 02:36:19.274]  Okay, repeat after me.
[02:36:19.654 --> 02:36:21.915]  When he attacks, we give our rights up, right?
[02:36:22.575 --> 02:36:26.117]  I mean, it was like Jim Jones drilling the cult members on how to drink their Kool-Aid.
[02:36:26.877 --> 02:36:36.782]  The media was doing this, so I could see all of the indicators, and I said they're going to claim Bin Laden attacks the World Trade Centers, they're going to do all this, call the White House, tell them don't do it.
[02:36:37.622 --> 02:36:38.643]  I mean, it wasn't hard.
[02:36:39.269 --> 02:36:40.209]  I also have some sources.
[02:36:41.530 --> 02:36:45.271]  So, I mean, they're going to do it again.
[02:36:45.331 --> 02:36:46.091]  It's going to be even bigger.
[02:36:47.712 --> 02:37:04.017]  And unless we expose who's behind it, unless we stop all of the mindlessness and all the debates about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, unless we really start talking about serious issues...
[02:37:06.500 --> 02:37:07.561]  Unless we get focused.
[02:37:07.581 --> 02:37:12.804]  All right, Linda Curtis, thanks for holding during my diatribe and Mike's eloquent comments.
[02:37:12.864 --> 02:37:22.590]  But this toll road business is everywhere, and she's one of the commanders over there at the Austin Toll Party fighting this, and it has been quite a soap opera.
[02:37:23.031 --> 02:37:24.572]  Linda, there have been a lot of new developments.
[02:37:26.093 --> 02:37:27.954]  Yes, I'm one of the peons here.
[02:37:28.664 --> 02:37:33.865]  So the peons all over this central Texas area are getting organized.
[02:37:33.885 --> 02:37:35.085]  The peon revolt.
[02:37:35.205 --> 02:37:35.505]  Look out.
[02:37:35.525 --> 02:37:36.486]  The peon revolt.
[02:37:37.806 --> 02:37:44.227]  And here's a mind blower, or maybe not so much to your audience.
[02:37:44.367 --> 02:37:47.588]  The peons are striking back and they don't like it.
[02:37:47.628 --> 02:37:48.688]  Check this out, Alex.
[02:37:49.668 --> 02:37:51.969]  The police union and EMS...
[02:37:53.337 --> 02:37:54.418]  Political Action Committee.
[02:37:54.438 --> 02:37:57.519]  Are being used as a front to launder money from the toll company.
[02:37:57.739 --> 02:38:02.261]  Yes, and EMS, last week, they made a major violation.
[02:38:02.301 --> 02:38:09.065]  They did not report a $20,000 donation, which is a little over a $100 limit.
[02:38:09.085 --> 02:38:15.108]  You've had the mayor's aides offering people cash on the sidewalk, and it's admitted nothing happens.
[02:38:15.568 --> 02:38:17.669]  We want to know who gave the $20,000 donation.
[02:38:20.542 --> 02:38:26.324]  And we want folks all over the Central Texas area to help us raise this question.
[02:38:26.364 --> 02:38:30.486]  Let me interrupt you before you get to the cherry on top of the new developments.
[02:38:30.806 --> 02:38:37.448]  Can you give us just a rundown of the toll companies hiring politicians' wives and sons the day after they sign the deal?
[02:38:37.729 --> 02:38:45.532]  I mean, it's been all over the news, the scams going on that make Mexico look non-corrupt.
[02:38:45.632 --> 02:38:46.712]  Like they have fair elections.
[02:38:47.242 --> 02:39:00.305]  Yeah, we have the comptroller of the state of Texas, Carol Strayhorn, put out an 85-page report of the toll authority and said, this is a state-elected official.
[02:39:00.325 --> 02:39:01.746]  This is not a bunch of activists.
[02:39:02.326 --> 02:39:04.746]  She said there are major conflicts of interest.
[02:39:05.367 --> 02:39:12.608]  The guy that was appointed by the governor has land next to some toll roads that have... And this is her party that's doing this.
[02:39:12.808 --> 02:39:13.889]  This is her Republican party.
[02:39:13.909 --> 02:39:14.729]  She's a Republican, folks.
[02:39:15.359 --> 02:39:20.103]  There's a fight going on in the Republican Party, I think, as to how corrupt they're going to let it get.
[02:39:20.283 --> 02:39:23.206]  Because they know it's political suicide, but Perry doesn't seem to care.
[02:39:24.026 --> 02:39:41.401]  Well, there was a rally on the steps of the Capitol today, and check this out, urbanites and suburbanites, excuse me, rural people and suburbanites and urbanites came together from across the state to try to stop the trans-Texas corridor.
[02:39:42.190 --> 02:39:50.637]  And the tolling of our freeways, apparently, many people believe, is being done to fund this mega boondoggle, $180 billion project.
[02:39:50.677 --> 02:39:52.219]  Well, we don't believe that.
[02:39:52.339 --> 02:39:55.241]  The TransNapta Corridor was in Time Magazine.
[02:39:55.722 --> 02:39:56.022]  Yes.
[02:39:57.523 --> 02:40:00.786]  Even Time Magazine... Same issue I was in, fighting a Swartzy.
[02:40:01.287 --> 02:40:02.368]  Yes.
[02:40:02.768 --> 02:40:04.049]  You know, that's a weird story.
[02:40:04.149 --> 02:40:05.550]  I've never told this story, I don't think.
[02:40:06.371 --> 02:40:08.333]  Sal Castillo walks up to me in Barnes & Noble...
[02:40:09.071 --> 02:40:14.575]  I was in there buying magazines and books, and he goes, Alex, look, we made Time Magazine.
[02:40:14.595 --> 02:40:15.195]  It was on the cover.
[02:40:15.876 --> 02:40:16.676]  And I said, oh, that's neat.
[02:40:16.716 --> 02:40:17.777]  So did I. He goes, what do you mean?
[02:40:17.817 --> 02:40:18.918]  We were in the same magazine.
[02:40:19.298 --> 02:40:21.199]  But, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:40:21.319 --> 02:40:24.241]  I mean, even USA Today admits Texas is the fight.
[02:40:24.301 --> 02:40:25.562]  It's nationwide.
[02:40:26.003 --> 02:40:31.626]  6,000 miles in Texas, 4,000 on the highways, 2,000 in the cities.
[02:40:31.646 --> 02:40:31.947]  Go ahead.
[02:40:32.587 --> 02:40:37.010]  Sal Costello is the fearless leader of the AustinTollParty.com campaign.
[02:40:37.441 --> 02:40:38.002]  We're good to go.
[02:40:59.013 --> 02:41:00.354]  The city and across the state.
[02:41:00.374 --> 02:41:04.237]  And they admit Texas is the fight, but there's a bunch of these examples, though.
[02:41:04.597 --> 02:41:09.520]  We have people on the state board that did this, across the board, pun intended.
[02:41:09.760 --> 02:41:16.965]  They're family members getting giant, multi-hundred-thousand-dollar desk jobs the day after they pass this.
[02:41:17.326 --> 02:41:18.666]  Right, and here's what's going on.
[02:41:18.947 --> 02:41:21.648]  Here in Austin, there's a local election taking place.
[02:41:21.688 --> 02:41:26.512]  There's three council candidates that we've endorsed in three races.
[02:41:27.350 --> 02:41:31.011]  And this is the first test of our electoral power.
[02:41:31.271 --> 02:41:34.232]  But what about the Clark Channel-owned voting machines?
[02:41:35.293 --> 02:41:35.933]  Good question.
[02:41:35.973 --> 02:41:37.373]  I'm so glad you asked that.
[02:41:37.433 --> 02:41:38.334]  Very magical.
[02:41:38.574 --> 02:41:41.595]  Here's the deal on the electronic voting.
[02:41:42.615 --> 02:41:48.597]  We need to be at the polls this Saturday, and the reason why I asked... Doing exit polls to match the numbers.
[02:41:48.697 --> 02:41:55.640]  Yes, and to talk to people on the way in to make sure that they know who the real anti-Toll Road candidates are.
[02:41:56.180 --> 02:41:56.560]  Because...
[02:41:57.479 --> 02:42:06.306]  The real estate developers are flooding the airwaves with confusing messages about who the anti-toll people are.
[02:42:06.326 --> 02:42:08.207]  They're claiming these folks
[02:42:09.426 --> 02:42:13.930]  Are claiming to be the anti-toll candidates when they're taking big bucks from the toll lobby.
[02:42:14.330 --> 02:42:15.492]  And we need to expose that.
[02:42:15.512 --> 02:42:16.773]  And that's not most real estate people.
[02:42:16.813 --> 02:42:22.558]  This is the big real estate moguls who are going to control the shopping malls and things that are built by knowing where development is.
[02:42:22.778 --> 02:42:22.958]  Right.
[02:42:22.978 --> 02:42:26.722]  This is the developers, not the real estate, you know, the realtors.
[02:42:27.182 --> 02:42:33.688]  The realtors are with us because they're going to be paying $2,000, $3,000 out of their pocket per year or more on these toll roads.
[02:42:34.628 --> 02:42:36.749]  Yeah, they drive more than the average, so it's going to be worse.
[02:42:37.509 --> 02:42:40.230]  I wanted to give people our number early in this.
[02:42:40.250 --> 02:42:47.652]  We're at Erica 512-371-9926 or go to AustinTollParty.com.
[02:42:48.073 --> 02:42:59.837]  I want to see a flood of people in our office over the next couple of days getting signs and materials and getting set up to be at the 300 polling sites so we can start monitoring.
[02:43:00.017 --> 02:43:02.277]  Here's the other answer to your question, Alex.
[02:43:02.878 --> 02:43:03.858]  Next March...
[02:43:04.659 --> 02:43:06.981]  The county clerk is going to be up for re-election.
[02:43:07.041 --> 02:43:10.464]  She brought in these electronic voting machines without a paper trail.
[02:43:10.945 --> 02:43:12.106]  Dana de Beauvoir.
[02:43:12.606 --> 02:43:13.727]  Dana de Beauvoir.
[02:43:13.788 --> 02:43:15.149]  I call her Dana de Bourgeois.
[02:43:15.950 --> 02:43:17.031]  Dana de Bourgeois.
[02:43:17.971 --> 02:43:26.780]  We need to run candidates, maybe even several of them on several different slots, to publicize what she has done and to try to take her out.
[02:43:26.980 --> 02:43:28.561]  She's been in office over 20 years.
[02:43:28.601 --> 02:43:29.262]  She needs to go.
[02:43:30.277 --> 02:43:33.978]  I mean, these people are fixtures, and she's been caught in election fraud.
[02:43:33.998 --> 02:43:34.798]  It's even been in the paper.
[02:43:34.838 --> 02:43:37.058]  Now, quickly, the latest stuff.
[02:43:37.078 --> 02:43:51.101]  I mean, we have federal and state laws here that you've got to say who the money's coming from, but so many candidates are afraid to take toll money from the toll companies because they know how unpopular, 90-plus percent against it, so they're fencing it.
[02:43:51.501 --> 02:43:54.221]  That's the term for the police and EMS unions.
[02:43:54.281 --> 02:43:54.981]  Tell us all about it.
[02:43:55.201 --> 02:43:58.822]  They're hiding behind the badge, and the police put out...
[02:43:59.423 --> 02:44:03.484]  This mailer saying, here are the pro-safety candidates.
[02:44:04.504 --> 02:44:06.384]  So now let's see your toll roads for safety.
[02:44:06.864 --> 02:44:07.064]  Right.
[02:44:07.084 --> 02:44:07.784]  They don't mention it.
[02:44:07.804 --> 02:44:08.985]  They say, back to basics.
[02:44:09.045 --> 02:44:17.386]  They don't mention that one of the basics that they're touting actually is toll roads, but they won't say it up front because it's become unbelievably unpopular.
[02:44:17.406 --> 02:44:19.586]  Have we defeated that transponder bill yet?
[02:44:20.347 --> 02:44:21.567]  Not yet, as far as I know.
[02:44:21.887 --> 02:44:22.707]  Man, we're in trouble.
[02:44:23.487 --> 02:44:26.448]  Next year we'll be getting our inspection stickers, folks, with a chip in it.
[02:44:27.088 --> 02:44:28.668]  The only recourse we have...
[02:44:29.540 --> 02:44:38.468]  Is to use the ballot box now and try to take back the ballot box next year when we can actually... But is anybody going to get in trouble?
[02:44:38.508 --> 02:44:40.549]  I mean, I guess Ronnie Earl's all part of this.
[02:44:40.569 --> 02:44:43.172]  He's not going to... People need to go to jail over this.
[02:44:43.272 --> 02:44:43.552]  Right.
[02:44:43.572 --> 02:44:48.136]  There's going to be a flurry of litigation, lawsuits, all kinds of stuff.
[02:44:48.616 --> 02:44:51.959]  And we'll see where Ronnie winds up after this election.
[02:44:52.579 --> 02:44:55.722]  But Wes Benedict got his lawsuit filed.
[02:44:55.962 --> 02:44:57.724]  Wes is running for city council here.
[02:44:58.536 --> 02:45:00.177]  With our support, Margo Clark.
[02:45:00.397 --> 02:45:02.658]  With our support, Casey Walker.
[02:45:02.678 --> 02:45:12.382]  I really beg your listeners to get on the phone, get on your email networks, and let the people know what's going on and get them to the polls.
[02:45:12.903 --> 02:45:14.844]  Very few people are going to vote in this election.
[02:45:16.144 --> 02:45:18.525]  Our network can have a major, major impact.
[02:45:19.426 --> 02:45:24.928]  Yeah, you've got 40-something thousand signatures, so you should be able to get those folks out to vote if they know how to vote or where to vote.
[02:45:24.948 --> 02:45:26.589]  Now let me just add this point.
[02:45:27.788 --> 02:45:28.749]  The Austin Chronicle.
[02:45:39.375 --> 02:45:52.844]  People that are against the toll roads, 93% of Austinites in polls, and that horrible, disgusting hit piece in this week's Chronicle is an abomination demonizing our movement to fight the toll roads.
[02:45:52.884 --> 02:45:54.025]  I mean, they are despicable.
[02:45:54.405 --> 02:45:57.247]  They are despicable, and they're the most vicious, and I'll tell you why.
[02:45:57.427 --> 02:46:02.010]  Yeah, the statesman owned by Cox News Service is much better than them.
[02:46:02.590 --> 02:46:12.916]  Right, and I believe that the Chronicle is concerned that we, our movement, is exposing the fact that they sold out to the establishment a long time ago.
[02:46:13.617 --> 02:46:19.500]  We are threatening their little niche to sell their newspaper.
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:20.561]  Their little hegemony.
[02:46:20.581 --> 02:46:21.441]  Excuse me?
[02:46:21.782 --> 02:46:22.662]  Their little hegemony.
[02:46:23.142 --> 02:46:29.046]  Exactly, and a lot of people are stopping reading their political coverage because it's so stupid and disgusting.
[02:46:30.447 --> 02:46:34.609]  Well, they always, 9% of the time, weigh in on the establishment side.
[02:46:34.869 --> 02:46:39.310]  They are anti-populist, anti-independent-minded to the core.
[02:46:40.231 --> 02:46:43.472]  So we need to come together.
[02:46:43.492 --> 02:46:54.936]  I was so thrilled to have you at the Tunes Not Told event last week because you brought in a lot of people to that event, Alex, and we had people from the right, from the center, from the left.
[02:46:55.897 --> 02:46:57.897]  The paradigm is shifting.
[02:46:58.357 --> 02:46:59.498]  It's the people...
[02:47:01.183 --> 02:47:04.286]  The people at the bottom versus the people at the top.
[02:47:04.367 --> 02:47:06.609]  No longer a left, center, right paradigm.
[02:47:07.330 --> 02:47:12.055]  And we need to keep building this because the last thing they want to see happen...
[02:47:12.842 --> 02:47:16.545]  Is people like us come together on some very fundamental issues.
[02:47:16.585 --> 02:47:21.369]  Since 96, I've been talking about the transponders, the toll roads, the thumb scanning, the grid.
[02:47:22.370 --> 02:47:23.551]  This is the grid, Linda.
[02:47:23.992 --> 02:47:24.812]  This is the fight.
[02:47:25.333 --> 02:47:26.574]  This is a key area.
[02:47:27.094 --> 02:47:31.158]  And AustinTollParty.com, when are you going to launch the Texas Toll Party?
[02:47:31.498 --> 02:47:33.040]  In the next couple of days.
[02:47:33.900 --> 02:47:40.206]  And believe me, folks, why this is important, the exact stuff we're facing is now in embryonic or even in...
[02:47:41.301 --> 02:47:47.305]  In more advanced stages in your city, in your state, believe me, if you investigate it, you'll find out it's happening.
[02:47:47.925 --> 02:47:49.006]  And this is so important.
[02:47:49.246 --> 02:47:51.107]  Linda Curtis, I want to thank you for coming on.
[02:47:51.147 --> 02:47:53.469]  We'll have you on again as this develops.
[02:47:53.869 --> 02:47:54.550]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:47:55.570 --> 02:47:56.171]  God bless.
[02:47:56.191 --> 02:48:00.413]  You can find out more about the true anti-toll candidates at AustinTollParty.com.
[02:48:00.714 --> 02:48:01.254]  We're fighting.
[02:48:01.294 --> 02:48:02.134]  We're taking action.
[02:48:02.555 --> 02:48:04.476]  And the establishment is pulling their hair out.
[02:48:07.722 --> 02:48:09.243]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:09.423 --> 02:48:12.504]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:12.644 --> 02:48:16.546]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:16.586 --> 02:48:20.847]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:21.168 --> 02:48:24.949]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:48:25.029 --> 02:48:26.890]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:48:30.153 --> 02:48:35.137]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:48:35.317 --> 02:48:38.360]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:48:38.540 --> 02:48:41.402]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:48:41.883 --> 02:48:48.008]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:48:48.528 --> 02:48:49.248]  We're good to go.
[02:48:49.268 --> 02:48:49.748]  We're good to go.
[02:49:06.974 --> 02:49:14.477]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:14.757 --> 02:49:25.662]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:49:25.922 --> 02:49:27.742]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:49:28.002 --> 02:49:31.323]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:49:31.663 --> 02:49:42.125]  But it's worth every penny, because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:49:42.425 --> 02:49:42.905]  That's right.
[02:49:43.106 --> 02:49:50.187]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:49:50.507 --> 02:49:59.260]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:49:59.300 --> 02:49:59.761]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:08.686 --> 02:50:14.608]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:14.848 --> 02:50:17.109]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:17.289 --> 02:50:23.631]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver, 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:50:24.031 --> 02:50:24.431]  Thank you.
[02:50:39.540 --> 02:50:40.040]  We're good to go.
[02:50:40.060 --> 02:50:40.361]  I think?
[02:51:13.439 --> 02:51:14.860]  I'll be doing my TV show tonight.
[02:51:15.581 --> 02:51:19.903]  And then, of course, after this show, I'm doing Jack Blood's program today.
[02:51:19.923 --> 02:51:23.546]  And then I'm going to film with Jeff Renz for two hours.
[02:51:24.507 --> 02:51:25.387]  And I've got another interview.
[02:51:25.427 --> 02:51:26.648]  I'm squeezing in between that.
[02:51:27.549 --> 02:51:28.109]  But you know what?
[02:51:28.149 --> 02:51:31.151]  I've got plenty of news and info to cover, and I'm fired up about it.
[02:51:32.752 --> 02:51:35.514]  Let's try to take a few final calls here on this Tuesday edition.
[02:51:36.351 --> 02:51:39.714]  Don't forget, we'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Time.
[02:51:39.754 --> 02:51:41.736]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Philly.
[02:51:41.776 --> 02:51:42.477]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:51:42.497 --> 02:51:43.478]  Hi, Alex.
[02:51:43.498 --> 02:51:44.399]  It's been a while.
[02:51:45.740 --> 02:51:50.565]  I want to talk about the public ownership of
[02:51:51.107 --> 02:51:54.809]  Of the land, of the roads that are being turned over to these toll companies.
[02:51:54.969 --> 02:51:55.849]  It's not free market.
[02:51:56.130 --> 02:52:00.892]  And by the way, the Texas documents, and others in other states, the Texas documents, show they have plenty of money.
[02:52:01.192 --> 02:52:05.714]  It's a sweetheart deal where they just, it's like the Soviet Union, they just hand it over to the oligarchs.
[02:52:06.134 --> 02:52:07.555]  No, this is what I came across.
[02:52:07.735 --> 02:52:08.616]  You'll still pay taxes!
[02:52:08.676 --> 02:52:09.076]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:52:09.096 --> 02:52:10.036]  This is what I came across.
[02:52:10.096 --> 02:52:19.061]  I came across this article in the American, Academic American Encyclopedia, and briefly it says that the states are not allowed to...
[02:52:20.307 --> 02:52:29.590]  You have to own public land except for Texas, which agreed to join the union in 1845 only if it retained its public land.
[02:52:29.670 --> 02:52:33.112]  Now, is that an accurate statement, Alex?
[02:52:33.172 --> 02:52:34.812]  Individual states do not own public land.
[02:52:34.832 --> 02:52:37.393]  Yeah, but they ignore... Exactly, but that is in there.
[02:52:37.413 --> 02:52:38.113]  I was aware of that.
[02:52:38.133 --> 02:52:39.234]  It's funny you mention that.
[02:52:39.534 --> 02:52:41.014]  But they don't follow their own laws.
[02:52:41.074 --> 02:52:45.356]  I mean, they... Look at the police and EMS unions engaging in money laundering.
[02:52:46.616 --> 02:52:47.737]  So my point is that the...
[02:52:49.335 --> 02:53:01.284]  There's been a breakdown of... There's been a tremendous... With the complexity of government, there's been a breakdown in understanding the basic law, and people follow the Bible literally.
[02:53:01.324 --> 02:53:03.346]  Why can't they follow the Constitution literally?
[02:53:03.786 --> 02:53:06.669]  Well, if you don't follow it to the letter, you don't follow any of it.
[02:53:07.229 --> 02:53:08.650]  It's the same for both documents.
[02:53:08.830 --> 02:53:11.552]  But it's only happening because the laws are becoming...
[02:53:12.526 --> 02:53:16.689]  Too complex to grasp and people are not... It's designed to make everybody a criminal.
[02:53:16.729 --> 02:53:20.511]  They pass over a million new laws every year, state, federal, local.
[02:53:20.551 --> 02:53:21.132]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:21.692 --> 02:53:29.417]  And I mean, now we've got all these private groups getting private police forces and then they pay off politicians to give them governmental power, but then they don't have the same rules.
[02:53:29.897 --> 02:53:32.539]  And here's another wrinkle before we talk to Don.
[02:53:34.520 --> 02:53:35.801]  Another wrinkle in all of this.
[02:53:37.930 --> 02:53:41.891]  I haven't done a poll of the police and firemen, but they're usually even more conservative than the general public.
[02:53:42.291 --> 02:53:46.692]  It's like 90-something percent of cops are against gun control, but most of the police unions are against the Second Amendment.
[02:53:48.033 --> 02:53:54.874]  I guarantee you the EMS and police unions, I guarantee you those members, the vast majority, don't want toll roads.
[02:53:55.274 --> 02:53:59.235]  They don't want to pay a couple grand a year to drive in Austin, a couple grand a year outside Austin.
[02:53:59.275 --> 02:54:01.016]  That's the admitted numbers.
[02:54:01.216 --> 02:54:04.717]  1,800 inside, 2,000 outside, 3,800 total, average family.
[02:54:05.317 --> 02:54:06.077]  They don't want to do that.
[02:54:07.088 --> 02:54:08.750]  But their union took their money!
[02:54:10.351 --> 02:54:12.633]  And if I was a police officer, I'd be real mad!
[02:54:13.213 --> 02:54:15.095]  Especially if I was one of these EMS workers.
[02:54:15.776 --> 02:54:16.717]  Don in Ohio.
[02:54:16.757 --> 02:54:17.577]  Don, go ahead.
[02:54:18.038 --> 02:54:19.399]  Just got a quick heads up.
[02:54:19.499 --> 02:54:23.883]  I get a daily email on what's going to be on Nightline.
[02:54:24.523 --> 02:54:33.832]  And tonight they're going to talk about the First Amendment and the people that, like the journalist that the CIA wants...
[02:54:34.608 --> 02:54:39.550]  No refs and stuff like that for not giving up their sources, but they're not going after Novak.
[02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:41.191]  That's what it's going to be about tonight.
[02:54:41.251 --> 02:54:46.614]  I had it up on my computer, but my computer... Yeah, Novak, who's the leaker that got a bunch of CIA agents killed.
[02:54:47.034 --> 02:54:47.194]  Right.
[02:54:47.534 --> 02:54:49.835]  But that was under Roe's orders, so it's okay.
[02:54:50.736 --> 02:54:55.198]  Well, that's on Nightline anyways tonight, so I'd keep an eye on it.
[02:54:55.438 --> 02:54:56.058]  Good job.
[02:54:56.078 --> 02:54:57.139]  Appreciate that.
[02:54:57.279 --> 02:54:58.039]  Jeff, anything else?
[02:54:58.239 --> 02:54:58.680]  Nope, that's it.
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:01.301]  Vile Candios, appreciate that call.
[02:55:02.634 --> 02:55:05.737]  Folks, I go out on the AM and FM band, a lot of new affiliates.
[02:55:05.777 --> 02:55:12.784]  We get new stations in areas where people listen on shortwave of the internet or satellite by you calling those local stations and asking them to pick the show up.
[02:55:14.345 --> 02:55:17.308]  We also, and we get a lot of new affiliates because of you.
[02:55:17.368 --> 02:55:17.768]  Thank you.
[02:55:17.788 --> 02:55:22.973]  You can also listen on global shortwave at night at 3210 during the day at 9.985 and the first two hours, third hour, 9.975.
[02:55:27.939 --> 02:55:32.682]  And as always, at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.net.
[02:55:33.743 --> 02:55:38.006]  By the way, a lot of the same news is on the sites, but different news is on some of the sites as well.
[02:55:38.727 --> 02:55:42.609]  So you might have, say, 70% of the same news on all my sites, all four.
[02:55:43.970 --> 02:55:46.272]  Then 30% or 25% will be different.
[02:55:47.773 --> 02:55:49.654]  So check them all out today.
[02:55:50.775 --> 02:55:54.558]  All right, my friends, just get out there and take on the New World Order and stand up for freedom.
[02:55:57.904 --> 02:55:58.093]  Nope.
