[00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:07.525]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.185 --> 00:00:09.246]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.966 --> 00:00:11.046]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:11.707 --> 00:00:12.587]  You want answers?
[00:00:13.287 --> 00:00:14.168]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:14.188 --> 00:00:18.650]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.172]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:24.332 --> 00:00:30.895]  Ladies and gentlemen, this Friday edition is going to be ultra-massive.
[00:00:34.074 --> 00:00:38.676]  Border Patrol told to stand down to make Minutemen look bad.
[00:00:38.696 --> 00:00:40.837]  They've always been told to stand down.
[00:00:41.478 --> 00:00:48.001]  The Austin police get awards from the President of Mexico for standing down, and they publicly announce it.
[00:00:48.761 --> 00:00:55.304]  That's why I went and bullhorned that narco-terrorist and shut him down when he was with our limp-wristed governor.
[00:00:55.324 --> 00:00:57.845]  All right, I'm getting angry, folks.
[00:00:58.746 --> 00:01:01.407]  Out of the gates, like a raging bull.
[00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.471]  They're killing this country.
[00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:04.671]  I mean, it's by design.
[00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:05.751]  Have you figured that out yet?
[00:01:05.771 --> 00:01:08.913]  We're going to be talking to Congressman J.D.
[00:01:08.993 --> 00:01:13.955]  Hayworth, Republican, Arizona, who's going to be on the road via cell phone.
[00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:15.575]  He's visiting a sick family member.
[00:01:15.615 --> 00:01:16.596]  We appreciate him coming on.
[00:01:16.876 --> 00:01:17.816]  He's outraged by this.
[00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:19.537]  So is Tom Tancredo.
[00:01:19.577 --> 00:01:22.038]  We're working on getting that congressman from Colorado on.
[00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:28.139]  Coming up, Army recruiters terrorizing and harassing kids, threatening to arrest them.
[00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:32.102]  It's a larger pattern that's now being discovered by major publications.
[00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:32.942]  Of course it is.
[00:01:32.962 --> 00:01:33.663]  It's policy.
[00:01:33.983 --> 00:01:37.646]  Criminality is policy of this criminal government.
[00:01:37.686 --> 00:01:38.427]  That's called tyranny.
[00:01:38.707 --> 00:01:44.672]  The norm in history is criminal government with a bunch of well-meaning idiots who enforce it for them.
[00:01:45.732 --> 00:01:48.194]  But why'd you take your rights now to keep you safe?
[00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:49.976]  Men in black masks say so.
[00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:58.328]  And we've got Aaron Zellman of Jews for the Preservation of Firearms ownership coming on to talk about the National ID card.
[00:02:00.212 --> 00:02:01.535]  And folks, I'll tell you all they're going to do.
[00:02:02.617 --> 00:02:06.958]  The illegal aliens can get these national ID cards with less identification than citizens can.
[00:02:07.378 --> 00:02:09.258]  They've caught DMVs in every state.
[00:02:09.618 --> 00:02:10.599]  Every state I've looked at.
[00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.019]  I mean, I've probably seen 30 or 40 states over the years.
[00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:23.141]  There's a new article every month or so where DMVs, state motor vehicles, whatever the state calls them, is caught selling hundreds, thousands, dozens of fake IDs.
[00:02:23.221 --> 00:02:23.941]  Well, they're not fake.
[00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:25.162]  They're real IDs.
[00:02:26.882 --> 00:02:27.902]  And that's going to go on.
[00:02:27.922 --> 00:02:28.642]  That's going to continue.
[00:02:28.662 --> 00:02:30.423]  It's going to make identity theft worse.
[00:02:30.523 --> 00:02:31.663]  All this technology has...
[00:02:32.598 --> 00:02:41.241]  And their answer then will be, of course, that you have to face scan each time you buy and sell to access it, and that's not going to work, so we better have a chip.
[00:02:41.602 --> 00:02:43.002]  And this is the official government plan.
[00:02:45.283 --> 00:02:46.444]  It's unbelievable.
[00:02:46.684 --> 00:02:51.846]  And, of course, it won't matter, because they're getting ready to pass the amnesty bill here pretty soon.
[00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.766]  It doesn't matter if those people are against it.
[00:02:54.107 --> 00:02:57.488]  And then they'll all just be legal, so then we'll all have our national ID cards.
[00:02:59.463 --> 00:03:02.525]  It's getting more and more amazing by the day.
[00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:06.368]  Things are speeding up exponentially at light speed.
[00:03:06.728 --> 00:03:13.012]  I had a major police chief on of Bergen County, New Jersey.
[00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:15.354]  I mean, what is there, a couple million people in that county?
[00:03:17.235 --> 00:03:22.158]  I had this guy on yesterday, and he goes, yeah, I've taken the microchip.
[00:03:22.198 --> 00:03:24.060]  And I go, well, will they tell everybody to take the microchip?
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.780]  Will you be for that?
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.360]  Oh, yes.
[00:03:25.921 --> 00:03:26.821]  Will you enforce that?
[00:03:26.922 --> 00:03:27.242]  Yes.
[00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:29.192]  But that's Big Brother.
[00:03:29.252 --> 00:03:29.793]  No, it's not.
[00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:31.695]  The government making you take a chip isn't bad.
[00:03:31.715 --> 00:03:34.738]  I mean, it's Twilight Zone.
[00:03:34.798 --> 00:03:35.960]  It's Body Snatcher.
[00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.500]  Weird.
[00:03:37.842 --> 00:03:41.286]  I'm waiting to wake up in an Outer Limits episode any minute.
[00:03:42.447 --> 00:03:44.830]  It's like a Lovecraft novel or something.
[00:03:46.632 --> 00:03:48.674]  Color out of space, color out of time.
[00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:52.985]  It's just blowing me away, my friends.
[00:03:53.265 --> 00:03:55.588]  And plus, there's just so much other news.
[00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:59.372]  The Border Patrol has been under heavy machine gun fire.
[00:03:59.392 --> 00:04:02.695]  And it'll be a minor little news item.
[00:04:03.997 --> 00:04:09.102]  Just a minor little item in a local TV station.
[00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:11.805]  You'll never really hear about it in the national news, you know, because it's a...
[00:04:12.603 --> 00:04:18.665]  Monthly occurrence now, people being machine gunned, killed, shot at, raped, burned out, arsoned.
[00:04:19.325 --> 00:04:21.026]  I mean, you want the wild, wild west.
[00:04:21.086 --> 00:04:26.348]  I mean, it's like something out of the scape from New York, down the border.
[00:04:26.368 --> 00:04:28.028]  You know, the Duke is A number one.
[00:04:28.088 --> 00:04:33.550]  I mean, it's lawless, anarchy, insanity, and the police won't help you.
[00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:41.293]  The cops that aren't dealing drugs, that aren't under the pay of the narco-terrorists, are literally hunkering down, having their pay cut.
[00:04:42.466 --> 00:04:47.809]  Being treated like filth, being told to pick up garbage on the side of the road instead of stopping illegals.
[00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:50.430]  It's hellish!
[00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.411]  Mexican flags are flying in five South Texas towns.
[00:04:53.651 --> 00:04:55.292]  No English allowed in court proceedings.
[00:04:56.212 --> 00:04:57.893]  Just total, complete bedlam.
[00:04:58.473 --> 00:04:59.914]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:09.295]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:09.616 --> 00:05:10.977]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:13.399]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:15.621]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:20.846]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:25.210]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.850]  We're good to go.
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.880]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.721]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:05:45.741 --> 00:05:46.261]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:01.986 --> 00:06:03.607]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.747 --> 00:06:07.769]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.989 --> 00:06:10.870]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:17.673]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.853 --> 00:06:20.855]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:21.055 --> 00:06:23.456]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:31.720]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as after
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.941]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:01.443 --> 00:07:09.414]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes, actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:07:09.815 --> 00:07:11.077]  It suppresses your immune system.
[00:07:11.277 --> 00:07:11.958]  Now, check this out.
[00:07:12.318 --> 00:07:15.763]  The average American consumes two to three pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:07:16.064 --> 00:07:18.187]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[00:07:18.707 --> 00:07:21.370]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:22.411]  Your health suffers.
[00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:23.272]  It's that simple.
[00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:27.577]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[00:07:28.037 --> 00:07:35.946]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[00:07:36.406 --> 00:07:40.508]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[00:07:40.848 --> 00:07:42.850]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Agaricus Bio at 20% off.
[00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:44.270]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.991]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:07:46.391 --> 00:07:47.152]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:08:06.989 --> 00:08:07.609]  Big Brother.
[00:08:08.290 --> 00:08:09.331]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:10.051 --> 00:08:11.152]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:11.812 --> 00:08:12.633]  You want answers?
[00:08:13.393 --> 00:08:14.254]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.274 --> 00:08:18.576]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:19.137 --> 00:08:23.279]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.183]  Believe me, my friends, you do not want to miss this Friday edition.
[00:08:31.244 --> 00:08:32.545]  We're on target.
[00:08:34.773 --> 00:08:49.203]  To dwarf that amazing broadcast we had yesterday with Congressman Ron Paul and the police chief who's taken the microchip and says that if the government orders us all to have it, he will enforce it, and he thinks it's a good idea that we all have the microchip.
[00:08:50.984 --> 00:08:53.266]  And this is a police chief over a county.
[00:08:53.286 --> 00:08:57.709]  They have a police chief up there, and police chiefs are in the counties up in New Jersey.
[00:08:58.229 --> 00:08:59.630]  It's got two million people in it.
[00:09:00.649 --> 00:09:03.351]  And he says he's taken the chip and we should all have it.
[00:09:03.371 --> 00:09:04.452]  And the government says to do it.
[00:09:04.492 --> 00:09:05.532]  He'll enforce it.
[00:09:07.274 --> 00:09:08.715]  I mean, it's Twilight Zone, folks.
[00:09:08.735 --> 00:09:13.017]  But if you think that's out of control, I'm sure you've heard the news.
[00:09:13.338 --> 00:09:17.100]  No, not the news of enemy forces trying to kill more Border Patrol.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:18.881]  And the Border Patrol being told to stand down.
[00:09:18.901 --> 00:09:20.422]  They've been ordered not to fire back.
[00:09:21.123 --> 00:09:22.103]  Not to defend themselves.
[00:09:22.123 --> 00:09:24.385]  This is how criminal our government is.
[00:09:24.445 --> 00:09:28.648]  Making sure that the country continues to emerge to death at the southern border.
[00:09:29.306 --> 00:09:35.750]  No, I'm not talking about K-R-C-V-T-V, or K-R-G-V-T-V.
[00:09:36.091 --> 00:09:39.093]  Border Patrol takes fire from across the border with automatic weapons.
[00:09:39.973 --> 00:09:52.542]  The monthly occurrence, every six months somebody gets killed on a federal agent, and of course every week or two it's a citizen of America, and every day they find dead Mexicans fed on by the coyotes, that is the smugglers.
[00:09:53.822 --> 00:09:57.345]  No, no, not that article today that you'll never hear about in the national news.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.360]  No, no, no.
[00:09:59.900 --> 00:10:03.941]  You try a citizen shooting at Border Patrol, that'll be international terror alert news.
[00:10:04.221 --> 00:10:05.542]  We need to ban guns.
[00:10:07.002 --> 00:10:10.383]  But when the Mexican troops do it, oh, they're so good.
[00:10:10.483 --> 00:10:11.043]  We love them.
[00:10:11.223 --> 00:10:11.903]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:10:12.203 --> 00:10:14.804]  There are five South Texas towns that fly the Mexican flag.
[00:10:14.824 --> 00:10:24.846]  It was a ten-part series back in 1999, the San Antonio Express News, explaining how, well, it's no big deal and you're not allowed to speak English in court.
[00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:30.508]  Only Spanish, which everywhere else it has to be ten different languages, and now it's five towns.
[00:10:31.549 --> 00:10:32.569]  That was two years ago.
[00:10:32.670 --> 00:10:34.010]  I'm told it's grown more now.
[00:10:36.311 --> 00:10:41.434]  Very interesting, but Border Patrol told to stand down in Arizona.
[00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.874]  This is out of the Washington Times.
[00:10:42.914 --> 00:10:44.535]  We have Congressman J.D.
[00:10:44.575 --> 00:10:51.999]  Hayworth, Republican from Arizona, who's outraged over this, and he's on the Immigration Caucus joining us in the middle of the next hour.
[00:10:53.383 --> 00:10:53.683]  U.S.
[00:10:53.723 --> 00:11:07.646]  Border Patrol agents have been ordered not to arrest illegal aliens along the section of the Arizona border where protesters patrolled last month because an increase in apprehensions there would prove the effectiveness of Minutemen volunteers.
[00:11:07.666 --> 00:11:09.786]  3,000 a day come across there, feds on numbers.
[00:11:10.286 --> 00:11:11.407]  The Washington Times has learned.
[00:11:12.387 --> 00:11:17.808]  More than a dozen agents, all of whom asked not to be identified, for fear of retribution...
[00:11:18.937 --> 00:11:32.681]  Said orders relayed by Border Patrol supervisors at the Naco, Arizona station made it clear that arrests were not to go up along the 23-mile section of the border that the volunteers monitored to protest illegal immigrants.
[00:11:33.662 --> 00:11:43.385]  It was clear to everyone here that what was being said and why, said one veteran agent, the apprehensions were not to increase after the minute men volunteers left.
[00:11:43.685 --> 00:11:47.146]  Again, showing the flood, showing that they held people back, and there was the...
[00:11:47.828 --> 00:11:51.174]  Mexican military there, tens of thousands of Mexicans stacking up.
[00:11:51.194 --> 00:11:55.962]  They were bringing in tent cities, food and water, and video was shot of all of that.
[00:11:56.803 --> 00:12:00.790]  And then as soon as they left, just masses poured across, and they were told, just don't apprehend.
[00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:03.320]  Just like our Attorney General and everybody else.
[00:12:31.469 --> 00:12:35.712]  At the agency's Washington headquarters, called the accusations outright wrong.
[00:12:35.732 --> 00:12:37.273]  Okay.
[00:12:37.774 --> 00:12:48.101]  Saying the supervisors at the Narco station had to block agents from making arrests, and that the station's 350 agents were being supported and carrying out their duties.
[00:12:49.982 --> 00:12:59.669]  And it goes on to say, Border Patrol agents on the front line in the Defense Against Terrorism, Chief Aguilar, said adding that 11,000 agents nationwide are meeting that challenge head-on,
[00:13:00.487 --> 00:13:03.568]  To the daunting task, as it may sound.
[00:13:04.248 --> 00:13:23.874]  The chief, a former head of the agency's Tucson sector, which includes the same station that gave the order, said that with the world watching the Arizona border because of the Minutemen project, agents in that section demonstrated flexibility and resilience in carrying out their critical homeland security duties and responsibilities.
[00:13:24.195 --> 00:13:28.756]  You know, before I forget this, instant message my wife, please, as my producer.
[00:13:29.663 --> 00:13:36.347]  Instant message her, Scott, and tell her to get me the Border Patrol Union leader.
[00:13:36.927 --> 00:13:38.648]  I want him on next week.
[00:13:39.089 --> 00:13:46.493]  He got him on about a year ago, and he said, yes, we've been told as part of world government that America is to be shut down and there will be no borders soon.
[00:13:46.973 --> 00:13:49.935]  We're just going to be basically traffic cops on the open border.
[00:13:50.255 --> 00:13:54.217]  Well, that's the Pan-American Union, the free trade area of America.
[00:13:56.038 --> 00:13:56.479]  It's open.
[00:13:56.519 --> 00:13:56.959]  It's happening.
[00:13:58.448 --> 00:14:02.330]  And they have been ordered, this has been in the news for three years, not to return fire.
[00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:11.634]  Even in the case where a Border Patrol agent was shot dead, when people got there to help him as he bled to death, they were still being shot at, they were ordered to not return fire.
[00:14:11.654 --> 00:14:13.955]  I mean, this is unbelievable!
[00:14:14.396 --> 00:14:21.179]  Oh, but cops, if you want to shoot a couple hundred bullets at a SUV that drives away from you into a neighborhood houses...
[00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:24.109]  Because there's an unarmed person, go ahead.
[00:14:24.169 --> 00:14:30.711]  Or if you want a machine gun, 12 houses until they explode into flame just because there's one guy in a house, go ahead.
[00:14:30.791 --> 00:14:38.212]  Or if you want to start tasering pregnant women because they won't sign a ticket or because somebody won't give a urine sample in a hospital while they're chained down.
[00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:42.773]  Or if you want to have the troops breathe depleted uranium, that's okay.
[00:14:42.793 --> 00:14:49.695]  Or if you want to just do not fire on the gods that are across the border.
[00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:58.573]  Do not shoot back, even though the Mexican troops have got $100,000 bounties on federal officers' heads.
[00:15:00.814 --> 00:15:04.416]  I mean, Mexican newspaper writers personally put out $25,000 bounties on Border Patrol heads.
[00:15:07.549 --> 00:15:08.349]  That's better than anything.
[00:15:08.409 --> 00:15:10.270]  They just openly say, we're going to kill you!
[00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:10.990]  Ha ha!
[00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.311]  And our government goes, good, good, yes.
[00:15:13.631 --> 00:15:15.412]  Yes, we're going to give you total amnesty.
[00:15:15.692 --> 00:15:18.993]  Yes, we're going to have loopholes where you don't have to have the national ID card.
[00:15:19.193 --> 00:15:22.774]  And our foolish citizens will believe us when we say the national ID card's for you.
[00:15:23.935 --> 00:15:25.175]  And they'll push us to pass it.
[00:15:26.556 --> 00:15:29.817]  I mean, he's starting to get... Folks, I'm not joking about any of this.
[00:15:31.137 --> 00:15:32.638]  Do you understand what's happening?
[00:15:35.619 --> 00:15:36.259]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:37.205 --> 00:15:43.092]  But Representative Tom Tancredo, Colorado Republican yesterday, said credible sources within the Border Patrol also had told him.
[00:15:43.172 --> 00:15:46.396]  Twelve agents personally told the Washington Times, folks.
[00:15:46.876 --> 00:15:54.325]  But Representative Tom Tancredo, Republican from Colorado yesterday, said credible sources within the Border Patrol had also told him of the decision...
[00:15:54.825 --> 00:15:59.047]  By the supervisors to keep new arrests to a minimum, saying he was angry but not surprised.
[00:15:59.387 --> 00:16:05.370]  It's like telling a cop to stand by and watch burglars loot a store, but don't arrest any of them, he said.
[00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:12.893]  This is another example of decisions being made at the highest levels of the Border Patrol that are hurting morale and helping to rot the agency from within.
[00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:17.595]  Well, yeah, you cut their pay and then say, but go be an air marshal.
[00:16:18.015 --> 00:16:19.976]  You can be an air marshal in two months of training.
[00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:24.658]  And you get $24,000 more the day you start than you were getting.
[00:16:25.078 --> 00:16:28.979]  And by the way, Border Patrol, you're allowed to look left or right, north or south.
[00:16:29.019 --> 00:16:29.459]  They tell them.
[00:16:29.479 --> 00:16:34.780]  But if you see people, this has been in the mainstream news, passing on one side of you, you can't even call other Border Patrol.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.081]  They're not to look one direction, and then they tell the people where to come through.
[00:16:39.101 --> 00:16:42.022]  I mean, this is documented.
[00:16:43.362 --> 00:16:43.462]  And...
[00:16:44.537 --> 00:16:45.857]  It just shows the criminality.
[00:16:47.018 --> 00:16:50.258]  I worry about our efforts in Congress to increase the number of arrests, he said.
[00:16:51.098 --> 00:16:56.420]  Based on these kinds of orders, we could spend the equivalent of the national debt and never have secure borders.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:04.701]  And, ladies and gentlemen, I mean, again, I don't have words to describe how serious this is.
[00:17:04.761 --> 00:17:07.322]  This is deliberate, by design...
[00:17:08.143 --> 00:17:11.145]  We've had the Border Patrol President of the Union on.
[00:17:11.525 --> 00:17:13.826]  We've had Tom Tancredo on many times.
[00:17:14.206 --> 00:17:15.427]  We've got J.D.
[00:17:15.487 --> 00:17:17.648]  Hayworth from Arizona coming on the congressman today.
[00:17:18.589 --> 00:17:22.431]  I have interviewed Border Patrol agents, retired and current.
[00:17:23.791 --> 00:17:25.512]  This is happening.
[00:17:26.953 --> 00:17:31.415]  And they tell them, your new job is going out into the scrub brush and picking up trash.
[00:17:32.116 --> 00:17:34.377]  If you see illegal aliens, you are not to stop them.
[00:17:34.969 --> 00:17:38.611]  You're to do this three hours a day during your ten hour shift.
[00:17:39.431 --> 00:17:43.113]  Three hours a day you were to ignore everything and pick up trash!
[00:17:46.755 --> 00:17:48.816]  We need the National Guard on the borders.
[00:17:48.836 --> 00:17:50.997]  The governors need to call out the state guards.
[00:17:52.737 --> 00:17:56.839]  And this is something that you can have conscription for.
[00:17:56.999 --> 00:17:59.100]  By the way, that's in the Constitution.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:17:59.901]  That's in the Bill of Rights.
[00:17:59.921 --> 00:18:01.161]  That's in the Declaration of Independence.
[00:18:01.521 --> 00:18:02.622]  The state governors
[00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:05.131]  Can order the men out.
[00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:16.674]  And if the governor, Rick Perry, who got an award from Vicente Fox for leaving the border open, seriously, he came here and said, here's an award to you, here's an award to the Austin police, here's an award to Wells Fargo for helping open the borders.
[00:18:17.255 --> 00:18:17.595]  Literally.
[00:18:18.915 --> 00:18:21.656]  And, again, it made the Associated Press.
[00:18:21.716 --> 00:18:24.777]  I went out and bullhorned them and exposed them and talked about that.
[00:18:25.357 --> 00:18:30.779]  But if the governor could say, yeah, of course, he wouldn't have to conscript if he put the call out.
[00:18:31.605 --> 00:18:33.466]  And send people to the border.
[00:18:34.027 --> 00:18:38.229]  And the Mexican troops open fire, send in A-10 warthogs, and kill them all!
[00:18:38.669 --> 00:18:39.410]  Kill them!
[00:18:39.430 --> 00:18:40.891]  Don't you?
[00:18:41.371 --> 00:18:42.212]  Kill them!
[00:18:42.232 --> 00:18:44.233]  I cannot believe this.
[00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:51.077]  And by the way, they've raised the standards for Border Patrol, where it's like being a member of the Green Berets or something.
[00:18:51.638 --> 00:18:53.599]  That's been in the news, and I've talked to the Border Patrol Union.
[00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.672]  You ought to hear the stuff I've talked to them about off-air.
[00:18:56.712 --> 00:18:57.593]  They won't say on-air.
[00:18:58.033 --> 00:19:00.596]  I mean, it's basically like special forces training.
[00:19:01.356 --> 00:19:02.778]  But, oh, you want to be an air marshal?
[00:19:02.818 --> 00:19:03.378]  No problem.
[00:19:03.398 --> 00:19:04.339]  You want to go do something else?
[00:19:04.779 --> 00:19:05.800]  It's designed.
[00:19:06.221 --> 00:19:10.345]  We have less Border Patrol now than we had before 9-11.
[00:19:11.566 --> 00:19:14.309]  And when the head of the Border Patrol said 11,000 agents, that's not true.
[00:19:14.849 --> 00:19:18.793]  There are 7,000 actual boots-on-the-ground agents...
[00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:21.871]  And there are 3,000 administrative.
[00:19:22.131 --> 00:19:25.172]  That's 10,000!
[00:19:25.212 --> 00:19:26.912]  10,000, scumbag!
[00:19:27.192 --> 00:19:28.193]  Not 11,000!
[00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:29.913]  You guys are such liars!
[00:19:30.373 --> 00:19:31.314]  It's unbelievable!
[00:19:38.576 --> 00:19:45.878]  A foreign government is attacking, is shooting, is killing, is murdering, and that government's run by the criminals in D.C.
[00:19:47.138 --> 00:19:48.799]  Do not apprehend the illegals.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:54.264]  But pull my family over and demand to search my car because it's for Homeland Security.
[00:19:54.544 --> 00:19:56.106]  Things have changed after 9-11.
[00:19:56.346 --> 00:19:59.689]  Everybody's seeing what you are, New World Order.
[00:20:01.946 --> 00:20:08.831]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:20:09.351 --> 00:20:14.774]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Non-X Nail Gel.
[00:20:15.195 --> 00:20:25.201]  All-natural Non-X is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:20:25.341 --> 00:20:27.723]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:20:28.083 --> 00:20:31.105]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:20:31.565 --> 00:20:32.745]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:20:32.865 --> 00:20:40.348]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:20:40.608 --> 00:20:42.349]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[00:20:42.689 --> 00:20:54.452]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[00:20:54.953 --> 00:20:59.294]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:21:01.130 --> 00:21:11.855]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:21:12.035 --> 00:21:19.618]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:21:19.879 --> 00:21:23.020]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:23.600]  We're good to go.
[00:21:41.829 --> 00:21:47.793]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a night light and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:21:48.013 --> 00:21:51.956]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:51.976 --> 00:21:52.616]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:52.636 --> 00:21:55.478]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources, the real money folks.
[00:22:09.491 --> 00:22:11.431]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:22:11.911 --> 00:22:12.792]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:22:12.832 --> 00:22:13.452]  The Dow has ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:22:13.492 --> 00:22:13.872]  A 5% increase.
[00:22:13.892 --> 00:22:16.332]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the Euro.
[00:22:16.352 --> 00:22:18.213]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed Euro.
[00:22:18.233 --> 00:22:19.693]  Gold has gone from the $390s to the $440s.
[00:22:19.713 --> 00:22:21.133]  A 16% increase in real money.
[00:22:36.992 --> 00:22:40.035]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:22:40.595 --> 00:22:45.739]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.301 --> 00:22:50.963]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:22:51.644 --> 00:22:54.586]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:22:55.027 --> 00:22:56.308]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:23:01.058 --> 00:23:02.218]  Why do you wear watches?
[00:23:02.518 --> 00:23:05.139]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:13.261]  At discountwatchstore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:17.402]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.
[00:23:17.863 --> 00:23:23.204]  As an authorized dealer of many fine watches, discountwatchstore.com offers fine timepieces.
[00:23:23.604 --> 00:23:24.144]  We're good to go.
[00:23:43.550 --> 00:23:46.631]  Free shipping and secure transaction is standard with every order.

[00:23:50.033 --> 00:23:52.714]  That is discountwatchstore.com slash radio.
[00:23:53.054 --> 00:23:53.815]  Or call toll free 866-371-2330.
[00:23:53.835 --> 00:23:54.115]  That's 866-371-2330.
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:09.606]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.227 --> 00:24:13.210]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.871 --> 00:24:16.733]  I want to be clear about this.
[00:24:17.994 --> 00:24:23.500]  If the federal government has any duty and any right and any job, it is to protect our borders.
[00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:34.214]  But notice, they want to take all of our freedoms and allow these foreign terrorists to kill federal agents, Border Patrol, Forest Service, FBI, citizens.
[00:24:34.994 --> 00:24:45.719]  The next time Mexican troops open fire, it is the duty of the Border Patrol and the military to go after them, to repulse the attack, to kill those that are firing on them.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.602]  When somebody busts in your house with a gun to rape and kill you and your family, it is your duty...
[00:24:51.269 --> 00:24:52.049]  To kill them!
[00:24:52.109 --> 00:24:53.809]  That is not even a radical statement!
[00:24:53.849 --> 00:24:54.850]  This is insane!
[00:24:55.170 --> 00:24:55.910]  They've been ordered!
[00:24:56.330 --> 00:25:00.411]  Folks, I've got all the Arizona newspapers, the Texas papers, I've had the Border Patrol Union Chief on.
[00:25:00.571 --> 00:25:02.851]  They have been ordered to not fire back!
[00:25:03.871 --> 00:25:10.833]  Now listeners, literally every other day, send us incredible music videos and songs and compilations they put together.
[00:25:10.853 --> 00:25:15.793]  Since we've got three or four guests coming up today, I don't know if I'll ever have time to air this, so I'm going to air it now.
[00:25:15.813 --> 00:25:17.514]  We're only going to air about three minutes of it.
[00:25:17.534 --> 00:25:18.574]  It's like five minutes long.
[00:25:20.846 --> 00:25:23.027]  This is one of the more interesting ones.
[00:25:24.687 --> 00:25:25.347]  So here it is.
[00:25:25.367 --> 00:25:27.587]  It's called Dark Side, and this is what we're fighting.
[00:25:27.867 --> 00:25:29.068]  Ladies and gentlemen, here it is.
[00:25:29.088 --> 00:25:34.009]  You don't know the power of the dark side.
[00:25:48.144 --> 00:25:58.273]  There is a chance to use this disaster to carry out the phrase his father used, I think only once.
[00:25:58.594 --> 00:26:02.037]  And that is...
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:24.736]  Darkseid!
[00:26:46.299 --> 00:27:08.117]  New World Order is run by absolutely ruthless individuals obsessed with total control sworn to the creation of worldwide tyranny
[00:27:26.135 --> 00:27:27.182]  Your country is great.
[00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.438]  The days of your country...
[00:28:00.316 --> 00:28:01.942]  American forces are here.
[00:29:15.966 --> 00:29:17.927]  Wow, and that is a powerful piece.
[00:29:17.947 --> 00:29:19.508]  We've got to get that put to some video.
[00:29:19.528 --> 00:29:23.409]  There's a bunch of music videos that have been put together.
[00:29:24.969 --> 00:29:30.351]  One that's been merged with Back in Black, shows the Nazis in black uniforms and cuts to our riot police.
[00:29:31.012 --> 00:29:32.072]  Extremely powerful.
[00:29:32.972 --> 00:29:35.213]  So I wanted to get that out there, and I want to commend all those.
[00:29:35.313 --> 00:29:38.014]  I mean, it just spontaneously started happening about six months ago.
[00:29:39.045 --> 00:29:43.049]  Every couple days, we're being sent better and better material.
[00:29:43.769 --> 00:29:48.453]  All right, get ready to plunge into the information as we resist the NWO.
[00:29:51.396 --> 00:29:52.317]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.777 --> 00:29:54.399]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.299 --> 00:29:57.982]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.098 --> 00:30:02.759]  Been a while since you've seen the dentist?
[00:30:02.979 --> 00:30:03.839]  Kids need braces?
[00:30:04.019 --> 00:30:05.259]  Can't afford dental care?

[00:31:00.706 --> 00:31:08.972]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.212 --> 00:31:13.575]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:13.875 --> 00:31:22.781]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.001 --> 00:31:26.604]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:26.904 --> 00:31:31.931]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.231 --> 00:31:38.979]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:40.001]  What about you?
[00:31:40.735 --> 00:31:46.097]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:32:02.722 --> 00:32:08.227]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.648 --> 00:32:12.872]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:13.112 --> 00:32:20.159]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.539 --> 00:32:26.645]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:26.785 --> 00:32:27.986]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:28.086 --> 00:32:28.647]  We're good to go.

[00:32:49.870 --> 00:32:51.311]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:32:51.331 --> 00:32:53.053]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:14.284 --> 00:33:19.509]  We've got Aaron Zellman, Chief of Preservation of Firearms Ownership, joining us.
[00:33:19.789 --> 00:33:22.752]  Talk about his analysis of this new National ID card.
[00:33:24.393 --> 00:33:28.677]  We're basically preparing for war over there to defend this country.
[00:33:28.737 --> 00:33:33.401]  It's just, for those that research things, I mean, the New World Order is attacking right now.
[00:33:34.262 --> 00:33:35.803]  We're under heavy bombardment.
[00:33:35.823 --> 00:33:38.706]  The country is on the verge of going under.
[00:33:38.746 --> 00:33:39.747]  I hope you realize that.
[00:33:39.867 --> 00:33:40.067]  I mean...
[00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:49.815]  If this was an aircraft carrier, they'd just blown off the entire conning tower and blown giant holes in the deck and bulkheads are leaking and fire's shooting out all over the place.
[00:33:50.295 --> 00:33:54.938]  We've got a chance to save the ship, but we've got to recognize it's on fire!
[00:33:54.958 --> 00:34:02.182]  I love this country because my family lives here, my heritage is here, and I know there's nowhere else to go that's free.
[00:34:02.202 --> 00:34:07.906]  I know we've been captured by criminals and we're being used as an engine of war to take over the rest of the planet!
[00:34:09.821 --> 00:34:15.444]  By Europe, that is using us as their shill, their disposable hero, that they'll later flush down the toilet.
[00:34:16.485 --> 00:34:17.626]  They're masters of that.
[00:34:17.766 --> 00:34:18.907]  Wheels within wheels.
[00:34:21.888 --> 00:34:24.770]  And, of course, we've got scheduled as well, Congressman J.D.
[00:34:24.810 --> 00:34:31.134]  Hayworth, Republican Arizona on the Immigration Caucus that's shared by Congressman Tom Tancredo about.
[00:34:31.494 --> 00:34:33.796]  Border Patrol told to stand down over a dozen.
[00:34:34.956 --> 00:34:35.937]  Agents have told them this.
[00:34:37.159 --> 00:34:38.059]  We already knew this.
[00:34:38.099 --> 00:34:40.640]  They've always been told to stand down, but here it is.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:51.342]  Stand down because tens of thousands of illegals stacked up on that 123-mile stretch of border that the Minutemen patrolled for a month, the month of April.
[00:34:53.023 --> 00:34:55.683]  They were told, look, they're going to pour across and you don't stop them.
[00:34:56.864 --> 00:35:00.925]  Get out there and you pick up trash, you keep your eyes down, you see them, you leave them alone.
[00:35:00.945 --> 00:35:02.525]  Do you understand that order?
[00:35:06.078 --> 00:35:08.020]  And that's word for word what we've been told.
[00:35:09.641 --> 00:35:12.823]  This is just standard operating procedure, but now we're learning about it.
[00:35:14.384 --> 00:35:15.785]  Now it's becoming more and more public.
[00:35:15.805 --> 00:35:17.606]  I mean, this shows how traitorous they are.
[00:35:17.966 --> 00:35:23.450]  It shows how ridiculous the war on terror is, and it shows how good these Border Patrol agents are.
[00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:28.694]  They've got some of the toughest jobs that law enforcement has in this country.
[00:35:29.454 --> 00:35:31.055]  One of the most dangerous jobs.
[00:35:31.495 --> 00:35:33.597]  Some of the lowest pay of federal officers.
[00:35:34.077 --> 00:35:35.218]  And that's by design.
[00:35:37.403 --> 00:35:41.045]  And the Border Patrol, again, was very supportive, quietly, of the Minutemen.
[00:35:42.685 --> 00:35:43.726]  It just blows my mind.
[00:35:43.746 --> 00:36:03.435]  You know, we were scheduled right now to have what Dale LaZahn on, he's the Houston Chronicle writer, on the story of Christopher Monarch, who received a voicemail from a recruiting officer who said a warrant would be issued for his arrest if he didn't show up at the recruiting office at a certain time.
[00:36:04.716 --> 00:36:07.978]  We're on the line right there in their newsroom, and he's stuck on some deadline.
[00:36:08.398 --> 00:36:10.499]  I'll tell you, these reporters are worse than congressmen.
[00:36:11.939 --> 00:36:13.820]  Congressmen are easier to get on than reporters.
[00:36:15.861 --> 00:36:16.281]  You know what?
[00:36:16.301 --> 00:36:25.285]  Tell my producer, I want to get on the youth that this happened to, the young man, because I do want to cover this story.
[00:36:25.325 --> 00:36:28.147]  But it's kind of good in a way, because I want to get into this Border Patrol situation.
[00:36:28.507 --> 00:36:29.947]  I had this other guest set up yesterday.
[00:36:30.348 --> 00:36:30.988]  But I do...
[00:36:31.877 --> 00:36:45.045]  For those that missed it, want to play the audio clip from local CBS News down in Houston, this piece concerning just more criminality by the government.
[00:36:45.526 --> 00:36:47.187]  And now we're learning it's, again, wider.
[00:36:47.607 --> 00:36:50.909]  This is a standard operating procedure to tell people you'll be arrested.
[00:36:50.929 --> 00:36:51.910]  You know that clip?
[00:36:54.071 --> 00:36:55.032]  All right, prepare it.
[00:36:56.132 --> 00:36:59.975]  We'll play it, and then I'll read this article, and then we'll go to calls and get back into all this other news.
[00:36:59.995 --> 00:37:00.375]  There is just...
[00:37:01.076 --> 00:37:06.179]  So much here that needs to be covered.
[00:37:07.579 --> 00:37:11.961]  In fact, here's the article, Harassment of Kids by Army Recruiters.
[00:37:13.602 --> 00:37:16.624]  And we already have that clip on the computer, by the way.
[00:37:16.644 --> 00:37:16.924]  Okay, good.
[00:37:16.944 --> 00:37:17.604]  We'll play it in a second.
[00:37:17.904 --> 00:37:20.085]  Harassment of Kids by Army Recruiters.
[00:37:21.526 --> 00:37:26.949]  Already failing to fill its monthly recruiting quotas in the face of an Iraq war.
[00:37:28.095 --> 00:37:29.876]  And people don't want to go to a nuclear wasteland.
[00:37:29.936 --> 00:37:38.301]  The Army will suspend enlistment efforts for one day later this month to address the rash of incidents in which recruiters harassed prospective soldiers.
[00:37:38.861 --> 00:37:40.362]  An official said Tuesday.
[00:37:40.382 --> 00:37:41.403]  See, it's widening.
[00:37:42.223 --> 00:37:45.405]  On Friday, May 20th, the Army will observe a values stand-down.
[00:37:46.406 --> 00:37:47.526]  Tell them to keep up the good work.
[00:37:47.607 --> 00:37:49.568]  Bonuses will be paid.
[00:37:49.748 --> 00:37:53.250]  During which recruiters will be told the right and wrong way to pursue people.
[00:37:54.375 --> 00:37:58.317]  Considering and listening to an Army official who asked not to be identified.
[00:37:59.078 --> 00:38:12.806]  There's a bunch of federal and state laws where if a cop or a detective or an FBI agent threatens you and tells you, makes up laws, there are just a bunch of different laws on that.
[00:38:12.846 --> 00:38:13.646]  They're felonies.
[00:38:15.407 --> 00:38:18.749]  And this guy needs to go to jail.
[00:38:18.849 --> 00:38:20.070]  But he won't, don't worry.
[00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:21.953]  You won't, don't worry.
[00:38:22.233 --> 00:38:24.975]  You can torture somebody to death and get six months commuted sentence.
[00:38:27.958 --> 00:38:31.381]  It's a reaction to the combination of events in various cities across the country.
[00:38:31.461 --> 00:38:46.333]  No one event made us do this, the official said, but an incident in Houston in which a recruiter threatened to call police to arrest a man resisting recruiting efforts was among the incidents that triggered the suspension, the official said.
[00:38:47.927 --> 00:38:49.848]  Let's go ahead and roll that audio.
[00:38:49.868 --> 00:38:52.588]  This is, again, the tip of the proverbial ice cube.
[00:38:52.808 --> 00:38:55.069]  Here it is.
[00:38:55.209 --> 00:39:01.491]  Going Army and making history appealed to 20-year-old Chris Monarch, and he called this Houston recruiting office.
[00:39:01.811 --> 00:39:02.791]  I recognize the name.
[00:39:02.811 --> 00:39:04.472]  His name was Kelt.
[00:39:04.852 --> 00:39:06.852]  Sergeant Thomas Kelt was the recruiter.
[00:39:07.533 --> 00:39:12.414]  But a new baby changed Monarch's plan to enlist, and he canceled his meeting with the recruiter.
[00:39:12.614 --> 00:39:14.114]  I said, I'm a volunteer firefighter.
[00:39:14.134 --> 00:39:17.976]  I'm eventually going to try to go career with it, and I'm just not interested anymore.
[00:39:18.276 --> 00:39:19.436]  And I hung up the phone.
[00:39:19.736 --> 00:39:25.818]  But the recruiter wouldn't take no for an answer, with a phone message threatening Monarch with arrest if he didn't show.
[00:39:26.218 --> 00:39:32.000]  By federal law, you got an appointment with me at 2 o'clock this afternoon at Greenpoint Mall, okay?
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.841]  Fail to appear, and we'll have a warrant, okay?
[00:39:35.101 --> 00:39:35.781]  So give me a call back.
[00:39:36.281 --> 00:39:38.342]  In fear, Monarch called the recruiter back.
[00:39:38.623 --> 00:39:41.364]  He said, uh, oh, Chris, oh, don't worry about that, man.
[00:39:41.384 --> 00:39:43.145]  That's just a marketing technique that I use.
[00:39:43.986 --> 00:39:49.129]  Reporter Mark Greenblatt of KHOU-TV questioned recruiter Sergeant Thomas Kelt.
[00:39:49.189 --> 00:39:55.573]  I'd just like to know why you have called up young men threatening to arrest them if they don't come and talk to you.
[00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:57.854]  No comment.
[00:39:58.134 --> 00:40:02.036]  You told the young man that this is a standard marketing technique that you use.
[00:40:02.677 --> 00:40:03.057]  Is that true?
[00:40:04.221 --> 00:40:04.722]  No comment.
[00:40:04.962 --> 00:40:07.004]  The case is under an Army investigation.
[00:40:07.284 --> 00:40:13.510]  It's really an insult to other recruiters who are handling themselves and conducting themselves the proper way.
[00:40:13.810 --> 00:40:20.176]  In Colorado, 19-year-old Michael Flaherty's recruiter gave him a laxative to lose weight to pass a physical.
[00:40:20.476 --> 00:40:22.018]  They even told me not to tell my parents about it.
[00:40:22.198 --> 00:40:26.502]  This form certifies Flaherty physically fit, complete with scores.
[00:40:26.902 --> 00:40:28.264]  I'm never completing any of those tasks.
[00:40:29.011 --> 00:40:30.833]  And my recruiter faked the documents.
[00:40:31.053 --> 00:40:41.562]  From fake diplomas from phony schools, detox kits to beat drug tests, Denver CBS station KCNC uncovered a number of recruiter fraud cases.
[00:40:42.023 --> 00:40:43.003]  It's very stressful.
[00:40:43.384 --> 00:40:51.491]  Former recruiter Jeffrey Bacon says he's been busted from sergeant to specialist for not meeting his quota of 24 soldiers a year.
[00:40:51.511 --> 00:40:52.452]  I'm losing my job.
[00:40:53.012 --> 00:40:54.874]  I'm in financial debt.
[00:40:57.199 --> 00:41:01.280]  This year alone, the Army needs over 100,000 new soldiers worldwide.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:08.482]  But with the war raging on in Iraq and volunteers harder and harder to find, recruiters face their toughest sell ever.
[00:41:08.942 --> 00:41:09.122]  Bob?
[00:41:10.082 --> 00:41:15.384]  Bob, I have heard of stand-downs after, say, a helicopter crash or something like that.
[00:41:15.484 --> 00:41:22.406]  I've never heard of the military ordering a stand-down, just a halt in the operations over recruiting.
[00:41:22.506 --> 00:41:24.026]  Have you ever heard of anything like this?
[00:41:26.101 --> 00:41:34.188]  No, a stand-down usually happens when there are accidents, crashes that need to be investigated, not when the roof falls in on the recruiting center.
[00:41:35.989 --> 00:41:40.914]  In this case, if it's not unprecedented, it is very, very, very unusual.
[00:41:41.034 --> 00:41:43.836]  Oh, boy, they're very concerned.
[00:41:43.856 --> 00:41:49.401]  A one-day period sometime in the future, and believe me, they won't have that day.
[00:41:50.382 --> 00:41:51.603]  This is what they're told to do.
[00:41:53.494 --> 00:41:56.015]  And I've talked to young people who are in these high schools.
[00:41:56.796 --> 00:42:00.777]  Folks, under federal law passed last year, they harass the daylights out of them.
[00:42:00.797 --> 00:42:02.938]  They get all their documents, all their test scores.
[00:42:03.558 --> 00:42:09.781]  They hang over you at the lunch area, in the lunchroom, in the playgrounds, outside.
[00:42:10.281 --> 00:42:12.222]  They harass the daylights out of you.
[00:42:12.242 --> 00:42:13.123]  They lie.
[00:42:13.143 --> 00:42:19.445]  And folks, I thought major military operations were over a year and a half ago.
[00:42:20.066 --> 00:42:21.046]  More than a year and a half ago.
[00:42:21.775 --> 00:42:25.438]  Three months into the wonderful invasion, Bush said everything's honky-dory.
[00:42:25.518 --> 00:42:25.838]  I don't know.
[00:42:26.278 --> 00:42:28.260]  We've got about, what, ten troops dying a day?
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.181]  A couple hundred Iraqis dying a day?
[00:42:33.658 --> 00:42:35.460]  Because it was about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:36.761]  Oh, no, that's a conspiracy theory.
[00:42:36.781 --> 00:42:37.642]  They never said that.
[00:42:37.742 --> 00:42:40.324]  Now it's about giving them democracy, so they have staged elections.
[00:42:40.824 --> 00:42:54.917]  No, we have the documents from the 80s now, not just the 90s and 2000, from the globalists, and they say we want to break Iraq up and make it into a religious and ethnic war zone.
[00:42:54.957 --> 00:42:56.558]  They want it to be a soupy mess.
[00:42:57.119 --> 00:42:58.640]  This is mission accomplished.
[00:42:59.375 --> 00:43:06.096]  Hey, triple the heroin, double the cocaine in our streets from the last ten years and many, many millions more people in prison.
[00:43:06.837 --> 00:43:08.517]  The drug war has done a great job.
[00:43:09.057 --> 00:43:12.378]  The drug-dealing families own the private prisons when your kids use the drugs.
[00:43:12.778 --> 00:43:13.658]  They put them in the prisons.
[00:43:13.698 --> 00:43:16.318]  They also make the money off the drugs and off the prisons.
[00:43:17.179 --> 00:43:18.879]  Education, the test scores keep dropping.
[00:43:18.919 --> 00:43:19.759]  More and more funds.
[00:43:19.779 --> 00:43:20.959]  That's because mission accomplished.
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:23.480]  I mean, this is all by design.
[00:43:23.500 --> 00:43:24.740]  You got a war on terror?
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.561]  You're going to see more terror, boys and girls.
[00:43:27.841 --> 00:43:28.421]  A lot more.
[00:43:29.488 --> 00:43:31.528]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[00:43:34.089 --> 00:43:55.954]  And why you would put your children in public schools where they have anti-terror drills, where cops point guns at them and scream at them in drills, where they frisk them, where they have ID cards around their necks, where they thumb-scan to get lunches, where they have you write, quote, a journal in the seventh grade in almost every school in the country under federal grants about your parents and your life, and it's done on a computer.
[00:43:55.974 --> 00:43:59.015]  Al Gore's Internet Initiative.
[00:44:00.126 --> 00:44:02.727]  And then, quote, checked in a federal database for plagiarism.
[00:44:03.048 --> 00:44:06.169]  But it's come out it isn't for plagiarism when they keyword check your stuff.
[00:44:06.389 --> 00:44:09.371]  It's going into a federal database what your children write and do.
[00:44:09.751 --> 00:44:12.993]  Folks, this is worse than 1984.
[00:44:14.473 --> 00:44:17.375]  The only thing holding them back is the fact that we've got guns.
[00:44:18.435 --> 00:44:19.416]  It's the Second Amendment.
[00:44:19.476 --> 00:44:21.977]  If we didn't have guns, the globalists would be moving.
[00:44:22.277 --> 00:44:26.579]  It would make the Red Terror and the Soviet Union look like a cakewalk.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.521]  It would make Hitler's activities pale.
[00:44:31.630 --> 00:44:36.035]  Meanwhile, Bush is appointing gun grabbers to every major position, people who want more gun control.
[00:44:36.255 --> 00:44:44.523]  Republican governors from California to New York are viciously banning and attacking and getting laws passed so people can sue gun manufacturers and shut them down.
[00:44:44.804 --> 00:44:47.346]  Gun manufacturers are shutting down right now!
[00:44:49.348 --> 00:44:53.032]  But George Bush is a conservative!
[00:44:53.853 --> 00:44:54.994]  I'm going to throw up!
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:59.521]  And now the new spin of the Neocons is, fight the New World Order, support George Bush.
[00:44:59.761 --> 00:45:01.481]  George Bush is fighting the New World Order.
[00:45:01.661 --> 00:45:04.262]  The New World Order is taking over, but George Bush is fighting it.
[00:45:04.942 --> 00:45:06.682]  George Bush, we've got to support George Bush.
[00:45:06.722 --> 00:45:07.742]  He's fighting the New World Order.
[00:45:08.102 --> 00:45:11.783]  First it didn't exist, now it exists, and George Bush is fighting the New World Order.
[00:45:14.623 --> 00:45:16.824]  Okay, I'm ranting, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:17.064 --> 00:45:20.004]  I mean, it just... What set me off last night?
[00:45:21.945 --> 00:45:23.625]  About 10 o'clock, got back on the computer...
[00:45:24.577 --> 00:45:26.198]  And saw the Washington Times report.
[00:45:29.199 --> 00:45:30.339]  Then I saw this one this morning.
[00:45:30.379 --> 00:45:32.200]  Border Patrol takes fire from across the border.
[00:45:33.681 --> 00:45:38.923]  South Texas Border Patrol officers take refuge across the Rio Grande at the Santa Ana National Wildlife Refuge.
[00:45:39.983 --> 00:45:51.267]  It says Border Patrol agents came under automatic weapons fire from across the Rio Grande after finding a truck being loaded with drugs at the Santa Ana Wildlife Refuge south of Alamo.
[00:45:51.307 --> 00:45:52.968]  The agents were injured in the exchange.
[00:45:53.903 --> 00:45:55.284]  No agents were injured in the exchange.
[00:45:55.364 --> 00:45:59.425]  All Border Patrol agents in the area as well as local law enforcement agencies responded to the scene.
[00:45:59.725 --> 00:46:03.287]  It is unknown if agents were able to wound their attackers across the border.
[00:46:03.747 --> 00:46:05.748]  It came at about 7 p.m.
[00:46:05.788 --> 00:46:10.369]  The attack came as three Border Patrol units were patrolling when they noticed a truck being loaded with narcotics.
[00:46:10.709 --> 00:46:13.471]  When they moved in, that's when they started taking fire.
[00:46:15.111 --> 00:46:17.672]  And in every other case, it's been drug dealers.
[00:46:19.133 --> 00:46:22.514]  What really set me off is Border Patrol told to stand down in Arizona.
[00:46:23.877 --> 00:46:24.217]  Hold it.
[00:46:24.257 --> 00:46:24.778]  Stand down.
[00:46:24.798 --> 00:46:26.238]  You don't stop those illegals.
[00:46:26.739 --> 00:46:27.779]  Who's up first here?
[00:46:27.799 --> 00:46:28.660]  I never got my calls.
[00:46:31.542 --> 00:46:32.162]  That's interesting.
[00:46:33.343 --> 00:46:34.203]  Who's up first here?
[00:46:35.984 --> 00:46:36.985]  Lisa in PA.
[00:46:37.025 --> 00:46:37.745]  Go ahead, Lisa.
[00:46:37.765 --> 00:46:38.346]  Hi.
[00:46:38.506 --> 00:46:40.887]  I totally agree with you with what's happening at the border.
[00:46:40.907 --> 00:46:44.530]  It's completely unbelievable, and yes, America is on fire.
[00:46:44.590 --> 00:46:45.330]  We are turning into 1984.
[00:46:45.370 --> 00:46:45.890]  That's interesting.
[00:46:58.286 --> 00:46:59.090]  I'm going to let you go.
[00:46:59.592 --> 00:47:01.761]  Listen, get out of my road, okay?
[00:47:02.142 --> 00:47:03.528]  This is my radio program.
[00:47:04.275 --> 00:47:07.416]  If I go out and tell people what to do with their websites, that's censorship.
[00:47:07.876 --> 00:47:14.139]  But when people just constantly want to have one of these little radio things where I talk about them just for publicity, I'm not going to do it.
[00:47:14.199 --> 00:47:14.959]  Get out of my road.
[00:47:15.339 --> 00:47:15.640]  Okay?
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.540]  We've got Border Patrol standing down.
[00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:19.601]  We've got the government carrying out terror attacks.
[00:47:19.621 --> 00:47:24.103]  We've got the troops breathing depleted uranium and 23 million Iraqis breathing it.
[00:47:24.283 --> 00:47:26.184]  We've got cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[00:47:26.744 --> 00:47:30.425]  And my radio broadcast is my broadcast.
[00:47:30.545 --> 00:47:30.906]  Okay?
[00:47:31.566 --> 00:47:31.646]  And...
[00:47:32.572 --> 00:47:42.542]  Maybe ten times over the years, with other cases, if I have a guest on or someone on who I think has said something that is slanderous, we will cut that out of the rebroadcast.
[00:47:43.142 --> 00:47:48.868]  In other cases, if somebody just thinks this is their radio program and it's not and wants to push me around, I say no.
[00:47:49.608 --> 00:47:49.929]  Okay?
[00:47:50.169 --> 00:47:50.509]  Simple.
[00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:51.350]  Get out of my road.
[00:47:52.196 --> 00:47:52.956]  Alright, thank you.
[00:47:53.397 --> 00:47:54.837]  Get out of my road.
[00:47:54.877 --> 00:47:55.998]  This is my road.
[00:47:56.418 --> 00:47:57.599]  My radio program.
[00:47:57.999 --> 00:48:02.622]  Open to anybody that wants to talk about serious issues, but not people that want to just squabble.
[00:48:02.962 --> 00:48:04.102]  Okay, thank you very much.
[00:48:04.122 --> 00:48:07.164]  Now let's get focused back on the serious issues.
[00:48:07.224 --> 00:48:07.924]  Who's up next?
[00:48:09.585 --> 00:48:10.346]  Ron in New York.
[00:48:10.386 --> 00:48:10.926]  Go ahead, sir.
[00:48:11.499 --> 00:48:12.079]  Hello, Alex.
[00:48:12.300 --> 00:48:12.600]  Hello.
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.241]  I'm as outraged as you are.
[00:48:14.361 --> 00:48:25.448]  I mean, to the point of complete rage hearing the story that was in the Washington Post about Border Patrol, rank-and-file Border Patrol, being told to stand down by Border Patrol supervision.
[00:48:25.949 --> 00:48:30.192]  Well, the Minutemen were policing that part of the border a few weeks ago.
[00:48:30.592 --> 00:48:38.077]  So as to make it appear that the Minutemen's efforts were not effective, this is, in my opinion, this is treason.
[00:48:38.097 --> 00:48:39.638]  This is sedition against the nation.
[00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.231]  This is something that has to be taken up.
[00:48:42.672 --> 00:48:43.853]  It has to be examined.
[00:48:44.373 --> 00:48:45.434]  It has to be taken up.
[00:48:45.454 --> 00:48:46.134]  But listen, listen.
[00:48:46.234 --> 00:48:48.096]  I mean, Ron, you've been listening for a long time.
[00:48:48.896 --> 00:48:51.999]  Were you listening when we had the Border Patrol union president on?
[00:48:52.039 --> 00:48:53.300]  He talked about this.
[00:48:53.560 --> 00:48:55.101]  They've been on stand down forever.
[00:48:55.501 --> 00:48:55.721]  Yes.
[00:48:56.142 --> 00:48:59.564]  And it's demoralizing the agency as far as the rank and file.
[00:48:59.604 --> 00:49:01.426]  I guess they figure that their work is for naught.
[00:49:01.846 --> 00:49:05.749]  But we're talking about sedition against the interests of the people of the United States.
[00:49:05.769 --> 00:49:06.049]  Exactly.
[00:49:06.489 --> 00:49:08.211]  The federal government should do three things.
[00:49:08.332 --> 00:49:15.339]  Coin and issue the money, defend the nation's borders, and just one or two other things.
[00:49:15.379 --> 00:49:19.003]  That's all they're supposed to do, and they're not doing the things they're supposed to do.
[00:49:19.224 --> 00:49:26.392]  And doing everything that they are not supposed to do, like stopping American citizens within the interior of the United States and hassling them.
[00:49:26.992 --> 00:49:41.004]  And then saying that it's for the war on terror when doing nothing to secure borders and foreign nationals invade, burglarize, and break into the country and God knows what intentions they have from A through Z and they're doing nothing to address that.
[00:49:41.485 --> 00:49:42.586]  Yet they'll hassle you.
[00:49:42.726 --> 00:49:44.147]  They'll hassle you on a toll roll.
[00:49:44.187 --> 00:49:45.729]  They'll hassle you on a checkpoint.
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.503]  Listen, this hasn't got to stop.
[00:49:48.623 --> 00:49:49.724]  We have to stop this.
[00:49:49.764 --> 00:49:52.208]  This isn't going to stop by some process of osmosis.
[00:49:52.228 --> 00:49:55.313]  This is only going to stop when American people act like people.
[00:49:55.874 --> 00:50:01.182]  And until they start acting like people, we're going to be degenerated down to the level of a slug.
[00:50:02.566 --> 00:50:03.767]  What is going on in this country?
[00:50:03.787 --> 00:50:06.069]  What is the matter with the people of this country?
[00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:09.031]  Look, the illegals are going to be exempt from the national ID card.
[00:50:09.071 --> 00:50:10.872]  The news will tell you otherwise, but that's the fact.
[00:50:10.892 --> 00:50:11.653]  You've heard Ron Paul.
[00:50:11.693 --> 00:50:12.334]  We've read the bill.
[00:50:12.874 --> 00:50:16.016]  And then meanwhile, the borders, north and south, are wide open.
[00:50:16.417 --> 00:50:16.697]  Correct.
[00:50:17.017 --> 00:50:20.860]  I mean, imagine over 10,000 people in 10 cities right across the border.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.241]  They're in Cochise County.
[00:50:22.481 --> 00:50:25.183]  The minute men leave, they've been called evil by the president.
[00:50:25.203 --> 00:50:26.244]  We're sitting there in lawn chairs.
[00:50:26.544 --> 00:50:32.089]  They leave, and then thousands pour across in a tsunami, and the Border Patrol is told, stand down.
[00:50:32.669 --> 00:50:41.117]  And Alex, the head of the Minutemen couldn't get into a meeting in Texas where Chertoff appeared, yet representatives of the race, La Raza, were in that meeting.
[00:50:41.538 --> 00:50:42.899]  Yet he was blocked from going in.
[00:50:43.600 --> 00:50:44.100]  You know that?
[00:50:44.721 --> 00:50:49.245]  Yeah, we've got folks from the Minutemen coming on as well later in the transmission.
[00:50:49.746 --> 00:50:53.149]  One of their heads, as a matter of fact, I forget his name, he has a newspaper now.
[00:50:53.169 --> 00:50:54.551]  Anything else, Ron, you want to hold over?
[00:50:54.851 --> 00:50:55.251]  Yeah, sure.
[00:50:55.451 --> 00:50:56.532]  Okay, another call's coming up too.
[00:50:56.552 --> 00:50:56.893]  Stay with us.
[00:51:00.653 --> 00:51:03.551]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:04.247 --> 00:51:05.548]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:05.748 --> 00:51:11.472]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:11.773 --> 00:51:17.016]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:17.317 --> 00:51:21.480]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:25.422]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:51:25.683 --> 00:51:30.286]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:51:30.426 --> 00:51:33.168]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:51:33.468 --> 00:51:36.630]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:51:36.690 --> 00:51:38.571]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:39.011 --> 00:51:41.092]  Order 911 The Road to Tyrion today.
[00:51:41.172 --> 00:51:44.534]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[00:52:00.322 --> 00:52:03.325]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:03.665 --> 00:52:12.513]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:12.813 --> 00:52:17.497]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:17.957 --> 00:52:24.682]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:25.082 --> 00:52:36.851]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:37.331 --> 00:52:41.793]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:53:16.059 --> 00:53:16.459]  I think so.
[00:53:31.567 --> 00:53:31.927]  We're good to go.
[00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:16.304]  We got Aaron Zellman, JPFO, Jewish Preservation Firearms Ownership coming on.
[00:54:16.804 --> 00:54:17.524]  Congressman J.D.
[00:54:17.564 --> 00:54:19.105]  Hayworth.
[00:54:19.125 --> 00:54:23.368]  We got Mr. Deacon coming on from the Minutemen and others.
[00:54:24.188 --> 00:54:25.249]  Talk about this stand down.
[00:54:26.978 --> 00:54:32.445]  Aaron Zellman will be joining us to talk about our new mega ID card, database slave grid card.
[00:54:32.465 --> 00:54:37.771]  And we got a bunch of callers for Gina and Bob and Davey and many others that I will get to early.
[00:54:37.791 --> 00:54:41.236]  In fact, we'll go to you right now after the break.
[00:54:41.816 --> 00:54:43.879]  We'll just hold Zellman over until eight minutes after.
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:46.322]  Go ahead, Ron, and finish up what you were saying.
[00:54:48.436 --> 00:54:49.657]  Ron in New York, you there Bubba?
[00:54:49.677 --> 00:54:50.597]  Yes I am now, yes.
[00:54:51.057 --> 00:54:51.437]  Go ahead.
[00:54:51.537 --> 00:55:09.045]  We have a situation where an American citizen who was head of a group doing his patriotic duty was deprived access to a town hall type meeting where Homeland Security Chief Chertoff was at, yet you had members of the race, La Raza, that's what it means folks, the race.
[00:55:09.405 --> 00:55:13.187]  Any group with a name like that as a hate group, they were permitted into that meeting.
[00:55:14.068 --> 00:55:17.169]  They were permitted into that town hall meeting, and he was excluded.
[00:55:17.799 --> 00:55:18.900]  This is amazing.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:24.204]  We've reached the point where I'm beginning to wonder if we are... Well, I'm not even wondering about it anymore.
[00:55:24.224 --> 00:55:25.005]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:55:25.385 --> 00:55:30.449]  We've reached the point where I feel that we may have quizzling elements in our own government, in this government.
[00:55:31.129 --> 00:55:36.874]  Okay, because if this is how they're going to conduct themselves, I would not... I mean, it just shows what a fraud the war on terror is.
[00:55:37.154 --> 00:55:38.976]  Telling the Border Patrol to stand down.
[00:55:40.156 --> 00:55:42.318]  Look, the government wants total amnesty.
[00:55:42.678 --> 00:55:45.020]  And people think there's national ID cards for the illegals?
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:45.801]  It's a joke!
[00:55:46.414 --> 00:55:53.127]  As mentioned in today's New York Sun paper, have you seen the McCain-Kennedy immigration bill?
[00:55:53.948 --> 00:55:59.058]  Do you realize that any illegal immigrant, all they have to do now, according to this bill, should this bill become law,
[00:55:59.759 --> 00:56:13.966]  It's paid $2,000 and some back taxes, and they would be permitted to become citizens, plus the bill encourages... It's interesting you mention that, because we've got Hayworth, who's out there supposedly fighting the illegals, coming on, and I was aware of that.
[00:56:14.466 --> 00:56:16.867]  I'll tell you what, Ron, I want to do this.
[00:56:16.907 --> 00:56:19.569]  If you'll hold for 30 minutes, and we'll see if he shows up.
[00:56:19.589 --> 00:56:22.510]  He's visiting sick family on a cell phone.
[00:56:24.011 --> 00:56:27.473]  Maybe we should give you the back number, and you should bring that question up for J.D.
[00:56:27.493 --> 00:56:28.193]  Hayworth when he's on.
[00:56:29.614 --> 00:56:32.537]  Also, the bill encourages what they refer to as chain immigration.
[00:56:33.258 --> 00:56:34.799]  Yeah, it allows them to bring their family in.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:35.140]  Right.
[00:56:35.420 --> 00:56:36.921]  It's like Bush's amnesty plan.
[00:56:36.941 --> 00:56:41.266]  Everybody here who is already legal, they can bring people here.
[00:56:41.526 --> 00:56:42.147]  Thanks for the call.
[00:56:42.467 --> 00:56:43.888]  Ron, you want the back number?
[00:56:44.849 --> 00:56:45.910]  Okay, hold on a second.
[00:56:45.950 --> 00:56:46.371]  Sure, yes.
[00:56:46.751 --> 00:56:48.293]  Or just, you know what, just keep him on hold.
[00:56:48.353 --> 00:56:49.654]  Just stay there if you want.
[00:56:49.914 --> 00:56:52.357]  If not, talk to him, Scott, if he wants...
[00:56:53.247 --> 00:56:57.109]  The backup number to call back, you can do that, because it would be good to have Ron ask the question.
[00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:58.409]  I've got the article here in the stack.
[00:56:58.429 --> 00:56:59.430]  It would be good to have Ron ask it.
[00:56:59.810 --> 00:57:00.230]  All right.
[00:57:00.250 --> 00:57:02.931]  We'll come back after the break.
[00:57:03.271 --> 00:57:06.793]  Go Regina, Bob, Davey, as quickly as we can.
[00:57:06.993 --> 00:57:08.254]  Actually, Davey's first up.
[00:57:09.034 --> 00:57:09.934]  We'll go Regina and Bob.
[00:57:10.675 --> 00:57:19.959]  Just real briefly here in the last minute of this hour, if you want to fight these criminals, if you want to expose how they're a bunch of murdering terrorists, you need to get martial law 9-11, rise the police state.
[00:57:21.958 --> 00:57:29.403]  And the film is three hours long, a mini-series on DVD, over two and a half hours on VHS.
[00:57:30.224 --> 00:57:31.124]  It's my best work.
[00:57:31.504 --> 00:57:40.270]  It covers the police state, what really happened on 9-11, and then who the globalists are, the Bush, Nazi, Schwarzenegger, Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, Luciferian connection.
[00:57:40.330 --> 00:57:41.071]  It's incredible.
[00:57:41.731 --> 00:57:44.413]  You can watch about half the film for free at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:57:44.433 --> 00:57:47.595]  We've got it broken up into five big clips, some of the key subsections.
[00:57:48.266 --> 00:57:48.626]  We're good to go.
[00:57:48.646 --> 00:57:49.027]  We're good to go.
[00:58:14.445 --> 00:58:14.605]  253-3139.
[00:58:14.625 --> 00:58:14.825]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:14.845 --> 00:58:17.186]  Now is the time to get these videos.
[00:58:17.206 --> 00:58:17.306]  888-253-3139.
[00:58:17.346 --> 00:58:18.207]  The transmission.
[00:58:35.077 --> 00:58:44.865]  We'll continue into the second hour as we wage war on corruption, as we crash through the lies and disinformation.
[00:58:45.145 --> 00:58:48.708]  The battle for the republic continues on the other side!
[00:58:56.134 --> 00:58:56.815]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.455 --> 00:58:58.536]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:59.236 --> 00:59:00.357]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:00.377 --> 00:59:01.819]  You want answers?
[00:59:02.559 --> 00:59:03.360]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.093 --> 00:59:07.755]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:08.275 --> 00:59:12.377]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:22.538 --> 00:59:28.620]  Hey Alex, I really did like your new video, especially the Nazi occult stuff, but real quickly, taking my point about
[00:59:48.004 --> 00:59:49.786]  The irony, there's an irony here.
[00:59:49.846 --> 01:00:01.235]  I just wanted to point out the fact that the anti-government right wing is the same who is crying for the federal government wanting more government to come save them from the Mexicans.
[01:00:02.616 --> 01:00:05.639]  Also, they're defending the national ID card.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:07.961]  Let me stop you.
[01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:08.982]  You're a libertarian.
[01:00:09.002 --> 01:00:09.662]  Hold on a minute.
[01:00:09.682 --> 01:00:11.083]  I'm going to let you finish up.
[01:00:11.424 --> 01:00:12.645]  Put him on hold.
[01:00:13.946 --> 01:00:14.226]  All right.
[01:00:15.603 --> 01:00:18.505]  Now, again, this goes both ways here, all right?
[01:00:18.986 --> 01:00:20.026]  So just hold on a second.
[01:00:22.248 --> 01:00:24.390]  You're obviously a pure libertarian.
[01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:25.651]  I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:00:26.291 --> 01:00:32.676]  The one place the federal government is to control, is to patrol, is to check papers, is the border.
[01:00:33.657 --> 01:00:34.958]  So I'm a constitutionalist.
[01:00:34.978 --> 01:00:36.339]  You're obviously a pure libertarian.
[01:00:36.779 --> 01:00:37.320]  Go ahead, Davey.
[01:00:37.935 --> 01:00:46.541]  Well, you know, the idea is these borders, they're to protect us from the monopoly of force from other governments, not to protect us from individuals.
[01:00:47.902 --> 01:00:49.183]  These individuals... And that's what's happening.
[01:00:49.203 --> 01:00:50.024]  Put him on hold again.
[01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:50.824]  Put him on hold again.
[01:00:50.924 --> 01:00:52.045]  I got a point-counterpoint with him.
[01:00:52.085 --> 01:00:53.006]  He won't go back and forth.
[01:00:53.964 --> 01:00:57.067]  Sir, these individuals have dual citizenship.
[01:00:57.568 --> 01:00:59.930]  They are saying they're turning America into Mexico.
[01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:03.073]  They are saying they're part of a reconquista, reconquering.
[01:01:03.673 --> 01:01:05.415]  And so they are a military force.
[01:01:05.956 --> 01:01:07.397]  Again, your argument is fraudulent.
[01:01:07.617 --> 01:01:07.978]  Go ahead.
[01:01:08.238 --> 01:01:09.899]  Marketing campaign by Clear Channel.
[01:01:11.007 --> 01:01:16.594]  You know, that was owned by Clear Channel, that sign that you had up on the website about, you know, California.
[01:01:17.014 --> 01:01:19.477]  Yeah, the big corporations are saying this is Mexico.
[01:01:19.497 --> 01:01:20.358]  They're part of it, too.
[01:01:20.759 --> 01:01:26.766]  That was part of a marketing campaign, so Clear Channel could have their radio station steal stuff they're sponsoring.
[01:01:27.324 --> 01:01:28.544]  That's what that was.
[01:01:28.584 --> 01:01:29.024]  No, it wasn't.
[01:01:29.044 --> 01:01:30.485]  Somebody bought it.
[01:01:30.505 --> 01:01:32.065]  Put them on hold again.
[01:01:32.165 --> 01:01:32.765]  I'll counter that.
[01:01:33.526 --> 01:01:33.986]  Listen, sir.
[01:01:34.026 --> 01:01:35.266]  You know what you're talking about.
[01:01:35.786 --> 01:01:42.448]  Those were billboards sold to a group totally separate from Clear Channel that owns TV stations.
[01:01:42.668 --> 01:01:43.969]  But Clear Channel went along with it.
[01:01:44.809 --> 01:01:45.189]  Okay?
[01:01:45.229 --> 01:01:47.710]  So, no, it wasn't part of a marketing campaign of Clear Channel.
[01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:50.250]  Clear Channel is one of the biggest owners of billboards in the country.
[01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:51.971]  It's like Reagan and the rest of them.
[01:01:51.991 --> 01:01:52.911]  It was bought from them.
[01:01:53.751 --> 01:01:54.411]  Okay?
[01:01:54.751 --> 01:01:56.192]  The space was rented.
[01:01:56.232 --> 01:01:56.552]  Go ahead.
[01:01:58.009 --> 01:01:58.970]  You have to talk over then.
[01:01:58.990 --> 01:02:00.151]  Let me make my point, please.
[01:02:00.191 --> 01:02:01.573]  No, I'd let you make your point.
[01:02:01.613 --> 01:02:03.295]  Okay, no, my point is... Put him on hold again.
[01:02:03.315 --> 01:02:04.376]  He just made another point.
[01:02:04.396 --> 01:02:05.978]  He says I'm talking over him and shutting him down.
[01:02:06.298 --> 01:02:06.779]  Not true.
[01:02:06.839 --> 01:02:08.721]  You make a point, and then I disprove it.
[01:02:08.741 --> 01:02:09.082]  Go ahead.
[01:02:09.602 --> 01:02:10.543]  Hey, golly!
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.380]  Come on, Alex.
[01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:12.861]  You got a new point?
[01:02:12.881 --> 01:02:13.881]  I just want to make my point.
[01:02:13.901 --> 01:02:14.481]  You have a new point?
[01:02:14.501 --> 01:02:14.902]  You talk over me.
[01:02:15.062 --> 01:02:15.562]  You have a new point?
[01:02:15.602 --> 01:02:16.262]  Go ahead.
[01:02:16.362 --> 01:02:17.623]  Are you afraid of what I have to say?
[01:02:17.663 --> 01:02:18.763]  Is that why you have to talk over me?
[01:02:18.983 --> 01:02:19.424]  No, sir.
[01:02:19.524 --> 01:02:21.604]  Each point you make, I... Why do you talk over me?
[01:02:21.664 --> 01:02:22.625]  I'm trying to make my point.
[01:02:22.645 --> 01:02:23.545]  Okay, make your next point.
[01:02:23.905 --> 01:02:28.007]  My point was, it was brilliant marketing, and, you know, that's all it was.
[01:02:28.307 --> 01:02:29.888]  And you're making a big deal about it.
[01:02:30.028 --> 01:02:33.369]  And it's great, because we're talking about it, getting all this free advertising.
[01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:38.232]  No, actually, it's... Sir, the Lurican taste is real.
[01:02:38.272 --> 01:02:39.152]  That's not marketing.
[01:02:40.894 --> 01:02:41.574]  And so what?
[01:02:41.674 --> 01:02:47.538]  I mean, they stole it from the Indians, the Mexicans stole it from the Indians, then the French stole it.
[01:02:47.678 --> 01:02:48.718]  I mean, it's all part of history.
[01:02:48.738 --> 01:02:49.439]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:49.679 --> 01:02:50.479]  Thank you for the call, Dave.
[01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:55.462]  Listen, our republic is better than the system in Mexico.
[01:02:55.482 --> 01:02:56.443]  This is America.
[01:02:56.603 --> 01:03:00.265]  The majority of Americans, 87%, are against all this happening.
[01:03:00.285 --> 01:03:02.706]  The majority of Hispanics, 67% in major polls.
[01:03:05.163 --> 01:03:06.124]  It's bad for the economy.
[01:03:06.144 --> 01:03:07.165]  It's bad for the wages.
[01:03:07.205 --> 01:03:08.526]  It's bad for our sovereignty.
[01:03:08.966 --> 01:03:12.309]  And your answer is, your big intellectual answer, is so what?
[01:03:13.350 --> 01:03:24.819]  So what if a group is saying we're racially pure, we're the supreme race, we're going to kick everybody else out, and it's a minority of Hispanics, and big banks in New York and our government is funding it because they want to balkanize this country.
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:26.521]  And your answer is so what?
[01:03:27.159 --> 01:03:31.424]  To something that's an integral part of the New World Order's program to break this country down.
[01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:32.906]  What do you say about the toll roads?
[01:03:32.946 --> 01:03:33.987]  That's also part of the plan.
[01:03:34.348 --> 01:03:37.732]  Oh, so what if I get taxed all this money that the government doesn't need?
[01:03:37.772 --> 01:03:40.475]  I mean, what are you arguing with, sir?
[01:03:40.535 --> 01:03:42.298]  Everything you said I blew to pieces.
[01:03:42.898 --> 01:03:43.759]  I crushed you.
[01:03:43.779 --> 01:03:45.742]  We'll be right back with Aaron Zellman.
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:56.062]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:56.243 --> 01:04:00.645]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:00.805 --> 01:04:05.187]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:05.227 --> 01:04:06.588]  The New World Order.
[01:04:08.369 --> 01:04:12.590]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:19.593]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:19.713 --> 01:04:21.754]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:21.954 --> 01:04:32.439]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:32.459 --> 01:04:33.279]  If you want to understand
[01:04:33.399 --> 01:04:35.522]  That's 888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.

[01:05:51.019 --> 01:05:57.647]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregosin, Oreganol, Oregomax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[01:05:57.987 --> 01:06:08.159]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P7-3 oil, in particular the P7-3 Oregosin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[01:06:08.779 --> 01:06:10.260]  With a 100% kill.

[01:06:51.486 --> 01:06:56.530]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:56.931 --> 01:06:59.173]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:11.008 --> 01:07:14.269]  Aaron Zellman is going to ride shotgun with us when Congressman J.D.
[01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:15.289]  Hayworth comes on.
[01:07:17.450 --> 01:07:25.372]  And then we're also got the folks from the Minutemen coming on who only sat out there in lawn chairs and called the Border Patrol whenever they saw illegals pouring across.
[01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:30.193]  So tens of thousands of illegals, over 10,000 was reported, stacked up.
[01:07:31.354 --> 01:07:35.637]  The Border Patrol came in and witnessed all this with the Minutemen.
[01:07:35.958 --> 01:07:38.580]  The Mexican troops came in, gave them food, bossed them out.
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:45.385]  And then after the Minutemen left, when April ended, the Border Patrol was told, Stand down!
[01:07:45.485 --> 01:07:47.787]  Don't go after all these illegals pouring across.
[01:07:47.847 --> 01:07:51.069]  I mean, that shows what a fraud this war on terror is.
[01:07:51.129 --> 01:07:59.436]  And joining us is Aaron Zellman, who just does a fabulous job, the head of JPFO.org, Jews Preservation of Farms Ownership.
[01:08:01.093 --> 01:08:04.416]  And we've got a little piece of music we're going to be playing later.
[01:08:04.456 --> 01:08:08.458]  That's one of the clips you've got up there in the computer, Scott and John.
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:11.400]  Because they're doing the smart thing.
[01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:14.843]  They're now using music and other things to try to wake the youth up to tyranny.
[01:08:15.463 --> 01:08:16.904]  And that's exactly what we're doing.
[01:08:17.845 --> 01:08:22.829]  But here to analyze the Real ID Act and what it really does is Aaron Zellman.
[01:08:22.949 --> 01:08:26.872]  Aaron, my brother in arms, good to have you on with us.
[01:08:27.312 --> 01:08:27.892]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:08:27.932 --> 01:08:28.773]  It's good to be with you.
[01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:33.634]  I tell you, Aaron, we are following the classic paradigm of tyranny.
[01:08:33.794 --> 01:08:56.111]  Every key indicator on steroids, every I is being dotted, every T is crossed, the black uniforms, the cameras, the police state, the tattletale squads, the terror drills, Bush is pushing for gun control, his governors are pushing for gun control, we're losing gun control battles everywhere, and the average conservative is totally asleep, sucking their thumb.
[01:08:58.068 --> 01:08:59.269]  And so what else is new?
[01:09:01.130 --> 01:09:09.373]  I shouldn't be laughing, but, you know, I mean, the government, I think, is showing its, well, has been showing its true colors for many years.
[01:09:09.454 --> 01:09:11.274]  But they're really coming out of the closet now.
[01:09:11.615 --> 01:09:13.155]  Well, I think there's a reason for it.
[01:09:13.876 --> 01:09:22.980]  This may sound strange at first, but the push now for national ID may actually be good news for us in the freedom front because
[01:09:24.099 --> 01:09:29.281]  It's almost like an admission by the government folks that they realize they're losing their grip.
[01:09:29.482 --> 01:09:29.922]  Oh, I agree.
[01:09:29.962 --> 01:09:30.982]  They're losing control, yes.
[01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:33.844]  And they're going to get dangerous from this point on.
[01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:35.464]  Very dangerous.
[01:09:36.405 --> 01:09:38.826]  I mean, I wouldn't be surprised to see some more Waco's.
[01:09:39.846 --> 01:09:41.127]  Everybody's saying that.
[01:09:41.207 --> 01:09:42.528]  Congressmen are saying that.
[01:09:42.928 --> 01:09:44.809]  Political analysts are saying that.
[01:09:44.829 --> 01:09:46.209]  A lot of people are saying that now.
[01:09:47.430 --> 01:09:51.612]  And so I would encourage people to hide in plain sight.
[01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:56.812]  The more visible you are, the more noise you make, the more difficult it is to harm you.
[01:09:57.272 --> 01:10:03.836]  I've also noticed, Aaron, that their operatives are really attacking me and others right now, both from above and below.
[01:10:03.916 --> 01:10:12.100]  Their low-level infiltrators on the net, their big guns, the big magazines and TV networks are really attacking myself and others right now.
[01:10:13.361 --> 01:10:14.982]  Well, I think that's to be expected.
[01:10:16.623 --> 01:10:21.406]  We get some odd phone calls from time to time where demands or requests...
[01:10:22.495 --> 01:10:24.716]  Smalls has some comments from some of our alerts.
[01:10:26.436 --> 01:10:27.836]  They have a lot to lose.
[01:10:30.377 --> 01:10:33.658]  Alex, as you know, if you want to understand government, it's real simple.
[01:10:34.278 --> 01:10:38.459]  Government's attitude is that if it's not under our control, it's out of control.
[01:10:39.839 --> 01:10:41.740]  And they feel like they're losing control.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:46.641]  So they're going to do what a wounded, cornered animal would do.
[01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:47.742]  Exactly.
[01:10:47.822 --> 01:10:49.442]  And I think that's going to be their downfall.
[01:10:50.387 --> 01:10:51.468]  Well, I think so, too.
[01:10:51.508 --> 01:10:54.149]  It's always been the downfall of evil people.
[01:10:54.309 --> 01:11:01.814]  And, you know, these people on power trips at the highest levels always think they're invincible, but at a certain point they get intimidated, and then they lose the initiative.
[01:11:01.834 --> 01:11:03.795]  And I think we've already hit that tipping point, Aaron.
[01:11:04.535 --> 01:11:05.196]  I think we are.
[01:11:05.276 --> 01:11:13.281]  I don't know if we're going to see death in the bunker, as with Adolf, but I think we're going to see some people get very scared and very desperate.
[01:11:13.681 --> 01:11:17.343]  And, you know, the National ID card is an example of that.
[01:11:18.433 --> 01:11:26.837]  Hopefully there will be people who want to sue the government over it, but this is just the tip of the iceberg of what could come very quickly.
[01:11:27.058 --> 01:11:34.081]  We had some correspondence from a security expert, and truly an expert in the field.
[01:11:35.262 --> 01:11:46.768]  He said that with the national ID established in 2008, the millions of databases will be so easy to crack into by hackers.
[01:11:47.811 --> 01:11:51.453]  It's designed to create massive identity theft.
[01:11:51.473 --> 01:11:53.053]  They're introducing us to the problem now.
[01:11:53.313 --> 01:11:56.915]  Then they'll exacerbate it and, oh, you've got a face scan every time you use it.
[01:11:57.255 --> 01:11:59.776]  Swipe your card, it's going to be used for a new national sales tax.
[01:12:00.276 --> 01:12:04.038]  Absolutely, and I think they're already doing some retinal scans at a few airports.
[01:12:04.338 --> 01:12:06.959]  Yeah, tell us what your source said.
[01:12:07.039 --> 01:12:07.579]  I'll shut up.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:09.900]  Pardon me?
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:13.721]  Tell us what your technology expert was telling you.
[01:12:14.422 --> 01:12:15.002]  Oh, well...
[01:12:15.835 --> 01:12:27.321]  I can't reveal his name, but the point is that he's been at this for a number of years, and he said that people think this is just some people are complaining that it's wrong.
[01:12:27.361 --> 01:12:32.363]  He says, but this is an armored column coming at the American people.
[01:12:32.403 --> 01:12:36.925]  No, it is a total straitjacket control grid, the likes of which never seen.
[01:12:36.985 --> 01:12:38.726]  It is a prison card.
[01:12:40.707 --> 01:12:41.627]  Well, you're right, it is.
[01:12:41.647 --> 01:12:44.769]  And that raises the issue as to why they're building so many prisons.
[01:12:46.902 --> 01:13:00.925]  I think that we're rapidly approaching a point in this country where, I've said this for a while now, that if we're going to keep freedom alive, we're going to have to start from scratch and go back to a Bill of Rights culture.
[01:13:02.105 --> 01:13:10.647]  And I've been telling people for quite some time that I think that the way to do that is to do what they've done in Europe to bring down communist regimes.
[01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:12.848]  And that is a total strike.
[01:13:13.248 --> 01:13:14.228]  Nationwide strike.
[01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:18.365]  This country could not exist two weeks without cash flow.
[01:13:19.747 --> 01:13:22.611]  Well, you're right that there are a lot of peaceful things we can do.
[01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:23.753]  You know, Gandhi said it.
[01:13:23.773 --> 01:13:25.896]  Again, I'm not a Buddhist, folks, but it's true what he said.
[01:13:26.577 --> 01:13:29.962]  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they attack you, then you win.
[01:13:32.895 --> 01:13:33.676]  Well, that's true.
[01:13:34.096 --> 01:13:37.416]  You know, you caused me to stay up until about 2 in the morning last night.
[01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:38.936]  I was on JPFO.org.
[01:13:39.317 --> 01:13:42.837]  I was reading that SS officer's 50-something page report.
[01:13:43.117 --> 01:13:43.597]  Oh, Stroop?
[01:13:43.857 --> 01:13:44.077]  Yeah.
[01:13:44.217 --> 01:13:44.998]  The Stroop report.
[01:13:45.038 --> 01:13:46.378]  This is written by the SS officer.
[01:13:46.678 --> 01:13:58.420]  In a nutshell, before we get into this National ID card, tell folks what a handful of Jews and Poles did in that ghetto against some of the most highly trained, vicious Special Forces soldiers.
[01:13:59.821 --> 01:14:07.644]  Well, if everybody remembers, on April 19, 1943, the Nazis attacked what was called the Warsaw Ghetto in Poland, in Warsaw, Poland.
[01:14:08.545 --> 01:14:14.247]  And their purpose was to liquidate the ghetto and just get all the Jews out of there and kill them off.
[01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.588]  And they even say that in the document.
[01:14:18.349 --> 01:14:18.949]  Oh, sure, yeah.
[01:14:19.409 --> 01:14:20.970]  And they had no qualms about this.
[01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:23.671]  And the ghetto was simply just a holding area.
[01:14:24.545 --> 01:14:26.966]  It was a smaller version of a concentration camp.
[01:14:26.986 --> 01:14:30.686]  Yeah, just a locked-down city like they're preparing here in America.
[01:14:32.087 --> 01:14:33.147]  Yeah.
[01:14:33.227 --> 01:14:36.268]  And they were not the least bit bashful about what their intentions were.
[01:14:37.128 --> 01:14:48.251]  And it was about, oh, literally, you know, maybe 20, 30 young Jews at that time who said, no, we may die, but we're not going to die as sheep.
[01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:53.572]  And they were led by a fellow who was only, I think, 19 years old at the time, Mordecai Andelowitz.
[01:14:55.792 --> 01:15:11.062]  When the Polish Home Army saw there actually were Jews who would fight, they made more guns and ammunition and grenades available, and then more ghetto dwellers, more Jews joined the fight, to the point where it was a couple hundred of them shooting at Nazis.
[01:15:11.603 --> 01:15:17.587]  But it all started with just a handful of people who had the guts and the courage to say no,
[01:15:18.605 --> 01:15:19.385]  We're not going down.
[01:15:19.425 --> 01:15:30.107]  And imagine, I mean, out of the millions of Jews and other millions of Europeans that Hitler went after, I mean, that 300, that 200 might have been one-tenth of one-tenth of one percent.
[01:15:30.487 --> 01:15:32.427]  Imagine if just one percent would have stood up.
[01:15:32.667 --> 01:15:34.048]  Hitler couldn't have gotten away with that.
[01:15:35.308 --> 01:15:41.249]  Well, it's not just, you talk about one percent, that actually would be of all populations, not just Jews.
[01:15:41.289 --> 01:15:42.109]  That's what I was saying, yeah.
[01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:47.030]  Because a lot of the other, a lot of people who made up the one percent had firearms.
[01:15:48.248 --> 01:15:49.249]  They had been gun owners.
[01:15:50.269 --> 01:15:51.130]  They weren't anymore.
[01:15:53.011 --> 01:15:58.954]  Most Jews, I suspect, were not gun owners at that time in Europe, although there were Jewish gun makers.
[01:16:01.176 --> 01:16:06.119]  Probably a good example of what happened would be the partisan groups.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:16.325]  These were people who fled from the ghettos, got to the woods, figured out ways to kill Germans to get their guns,
[01:16:16.992 --> 01:16:19.533]  And then use those guns to kill them again to get bigger guns.
[01:16:19.573 --> 01:16:21.574]  And by the way, you don't even need a gun to do that.
[01:16:21.594 --> 01:16:23.215]  You've got the butter knife brigades.
[01:16:25.136 --> 01:16:26.477]  Well, you can throw stones at them.
[01:16:26.497 --> 01:16:27.197]  You can cut wires.
[01:16:27.217 --> 01:16:28.158]  You can sabotage.
[01:16:28.198 --> 01:16:29.398]  You can blow up.
[01:16:29.959 --> 01:16:34.961]  All kinds of things that have been recorded in books about partisans.
[01:16:36.742 --> 01:16:41.885]  The point I want to make is that the American people are going to be faced with the same
[01:16:42.534 --> 01:16:43.254]  Well, that's another point.
[01:16:43.274 --> 01:16:46.996]  Some people would look at the public school system as a starter for a prison camp for kids.
[01:16:47.016 --> 01:16:48.777]  As a primer, so to speak.
[01:17:09.451 --> 01:17:12.532]  But the American people are going to be faced with those same questions.
[01:17:12.552 --> 01:17:14.013]  I want to go back over this.
[01:17:14.053 --> 01:17:17.554]  How many Germans did they kill, according to the... How many SS officers?
[01:17:19.035 --> 01:17:23.117]  You know, I must confess, I don't remember the number, but they probably killed several hundred of them.
[01:17:24.417 --> 01:17:25.378]  Maybe even more.
[01:17:25.598 --> 01:17:27.158]  And held them off for a long time.
[01:17:27.459 --> 01:17:27.939]  Exactly.
[01:17:28.399 --> 01:17:35.682]  What happened was, I think it was the surprise of someone saying, no, you're not going to just roll over us.
[01:17:36.302 --> 01:17:37.903]  It shook the Germans up more.
[01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:42.418]  Well, you know, you've often heard the saying that if Adolf had the technology
[01:18:08.664 --> 01:18:10.145]  Then, we have today.
[01:18:10.365 --> 01:18:12.106]  Imagine what he could have done worldwide.
[01:18:12.486 --> 01:18:15.928]  Have you seen, I've seen it, it's an incredible film, have you seen Downfall?
[01:18:16.929 --> 01:18:17.569]  No, I have not.
[01:18:17.749 --> 01:18:18.590]  You've got to see it.
[01:18:19.450 --> 01:18:21.011]  The last 11 days in the bunker?
[01:18:21.672 --> 01:18:24.593]  Oh, okay, I've heard about it, but I've not seen it.
[01:18:24.613 --> 01:18:28.716]  They're calling it the best war movie ever, and I've read a lot of history books, it's incredibly accurate.
[01:18:30.477 --> 01:18:34.980]  There was a fascinating interview, by the way, with... The lady, the secretary.
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:35.400]  The nurse.
[01:18:36.964 --> 01:18:40.966]  A 92-year-old woman who was a nurse to the Nazis in the bunker.
[01:18:41.946 --> 01:18:43.026]  Yeah, and the secretary, too.
[01:18:43.046 --> 01:18:43.607]  She just died.
[01:18:43.987 --> 01:18:44.407]  Stay there.
[01:18:44.447 --> 01:18:47.568]  We're going to come back and continue with the National ID card.
[01:18:48.769 --> 01:18:49.209]  Stay with us.
[01:18:50.666 --> 01:18:54.767]  If the cost of your prescriptions are getting out of control, you want to listen carefully to this.

[01:19:33.851 --> 01:19:34.311]  That's 888-216-2461.
[01:19:50.311 --> 01:19:58.941]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling clean water possible.

[01:20:51.440 --> 01:20:53.661]  Hello, Ted Anderson here with Midas Resources.
[01:20:54.101 --> 01:20:58.444]  Lately I've been hearing people tell me that gold is so low now that it would be a perfect time to buy.
[01:20:58.724 --> 01:21:04.527]  With over 20 years of personal experience in the gold business, I can tell you that opportunities like this can be counted on one hand.
[01:21:04.767 --> 01:21:08.829]  The truth is very few people have the fortitude to actually act on a market like this.
[01:21:09.109 --> 01:21:14.732]  However, they have become the elite group more than doubling their investment over moderate time span.
[01:21:14.852 --> 01:21:17.473]  In 1982, gold was trading in a range of $275 per ounce.
[01:21:19.574 --> 01:21:19.834]  Again, 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:52.302]  All water isn't the same.
[01:21:52.582 --> 01:21:57.565]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[01:21:57.825 --> 01:21:59.286]  Water is not what we happen to drink.
[01:21:59.486 --> 01:22:08.011]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[01:22:08.391 --> 01:22:16.837]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.

[01:22:49.356 --> 01:22:51.557]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:52.118 --> 01:22:54.919]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:17.008]  Aaron Zellman, before we get back into the new Super National ID card, the slave card, literally folks, Ron Paul was talking about how it's more than a National ID card yesterday.
[01:23:17.349 --> 01:23:19.190]  Tracking grids, taxation, everything.
[01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:21.932]  Coming up later, I want to play one of these songs.
[01:23:21.952 --> 01:23:23.373]  You guys have started something new.
[01:23:24.754 --> 01:23:26.676]  Tell us about your...
[01:23:27.688 --> 01:23:29.489]  You're a new movement to wake up the youth.
[01:23:30.749 --> 01:23:32.230]  We have a new concept.
[01:23:32.670 --> 01:23:35.271]  It's called Rebel Fire.
[01:23:35.291 --> 01:23:41.494]  There's a website called rebelfirerock.com.
[01:23:43.174 --> 01:23:47.916]  We're trying to get people to go there to listen to music.
[01:23:47.936 --> 01:23:49.457]  You're now playing to download it.
[01:23:49.497 --> 01:23:49.897]  It's free.
[01:23:50.972 --> 01:23:54.733]  And to help reach the youth of America with a book that we've published called Out of the Gray Zone.
[01:23:54.773 --> 01:23:57.754]  Tell you what, let's roll part of this song right now.
[01:23:58.674 --> 01:24:01.635]  Aaron, who did this particular song you were just hearing?
[01:24:02.675 --> 01:24:03.195]  Who did it?
[01:24:03.416 --> 01:24:03.676]  Yes.
[01:24:03.916 --> 01:24:06.136]  A fellow, his name is Rockne Van Meter.
[01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:07.737]  Okay, let's go ahead and play this song.
[01:24:07.777 --> 01:24:08.117]  Here it is.
[01:24:08.137 --> 01:24:08.637]  Play part of it.
[01:24:08.657 --> 01:24:16.099]  Go ahead and roll it, and we'll put Aaron on hold.
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:18.740]  You're the blue...
[01:24:20.298 --> 01:24:45.978]  Stopping on the human face forever You're the eye Staring down on everyone And never seeing wrong You're the lie Twisting all our minds into your whoredom You were death You were war You were slavery
[01:24:48.607 --> 01:24:49.729]  You're the law.
[01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:51.512]  You're the law.
[01:24:52.333 --> 01:24:53.515]  You're the law.
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:24:58.182]  We'll last you like...
[01:25:09.462 --> 01:25:12.745]  We're good to go.
[01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:29.260]  We're good to go.
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:30.801]  We're good to go.
[01:25:30.881 --> 01:25:32.261]  We're good to go.
[01:25:32.281 --> 01:25:33.962]  We're good to go.
[01:25:59.793 --> 01:26:00.594]  We're good to go.
[01:26:10.707 --> 01:26:12.188]  We're good to go.
[01:26:54.737 --> 01:27:04.124]  Ladies and gentlemen, there are squadrons of incredibly powerful songs like this on this new website that Aaron Zellman and his crew have launched.
[01:27:04.796 --> 01:27:07.138]  Aaron, man, that is powerful stuff.
[01:27:07.458 --> 01:27:08.679]  That's what we need is hope.
[01:27:09.179 --> 01:27:11.520]  And I totally agree with those words, my friend.
[01:27:12.181 --> 01:27:15.883]  In fact, the lyrics are on the site so people can download them.
[01:27:15.943 --> 01:27:20.646]  And the song is there to be downloaded free to share with everyone in the world.
[01:27:20.666 --> 01:27:21.427]  I saw a bunch of songs.
[01:27:22.205 --> 01:27:22.506]  Pardon me?
[01:27:22.686 --> 01:27:23.947]  I saw a bunch of songs on there.
[01:27:24.367 --> 01:27:25.729]  Well, actually, there's another one on there.
[01:27:25.749 --> 01:27:28.131]  It's just a heavy metal version of that song.
[01:27:28.572 --> 01:27:30.013]  I just saw a bunch of links to music.
[01:27:30.033 --> 01:27:32.296]  Boy, I tell you, that is great stuff.
[01:27:32.496 --> 01:27:33.997]  I mean, it's the truth.
[01:27:34.338 --> 01:27:40.184]  By the way, we carry Aaron Zellman's incredibly produced, I mean, it's like Discovery Channel quality, video, Innocence Betrayed.
[01:27:40.204 --> 01:27:42.206]  It comes with three comic books.
[01:27:42.666 --> 01:27:48.370]  Grandpa Jack to wake children up and adults too at their reading level to what the Second Amendment is really about.
[01:27:48.710 --> 01:27:54.214]  We carry that at Infowars.com and PresidentPlanet.com and I'm really proud of this film.
[01:27:54.274 --> 01:27:55.896]  I never promote it like I should.
[01:27:55.936 --> 01:27:57.897]  I hope you'll get Innocence Betrayed.
[01:27:57.977 --> 01:27:59.758]  Aaron, real quick, tell folks about that film.
[01:28:00.719 --> 01:28:03.781]  Well, the film really shows people what they're not supposed to know.
[01:28:03.801 --> 01:28:08.545]  It's the other side of the story of how evil gun control can be.
[01:28:09.615 --> 01:28:14.237]  People have shown it to those who have supported gun control in the past.
[01:28:14.837 --> 01:28:16.017]  And I mean in the past.
[01:28:16.057 --> 01:28:17.558]  They no longer support gun control.
[01:28:17.618 --> 01:28:18.678]  They've seen the truth.
[01:28:18.898 --> 01:28:20.899]  It's a great deprogramming tool, is it not?
[01:28:21.179 --> 01:28:21.819]  I think it is.
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:29.782]  In 58 minutes, you can turn someone around who's spent the last 20, 30 years of their life... In 10 seconds, give us that website for that music.
[01:28:29.902 --> 01:28:35.364]  It is R-E-B-E-L-F-I-R-E-R-O-C-K.
[01:28:35.384 --> 01:28:36.925]  That is rubblefirerock.com.
[01:28:38.503 --> 01:28:39.406]  We're on the march.
[01:28:39.907 --> 01:28:41.513]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:42.436 --> 01:28:45.125]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:48.408 --> 01:28:50.769]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:28:51.030 --> 01:28:54.872]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:28:55.192 --> 01:28:55.993]  Read the labels.
[01:28:56.433 --> 01:29:00.535]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:29:00.775 --> 01:29:04.978]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:29:05.338 --> 01:29:10.221]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:29:10.601 --> 01:29:14.183]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:29:14.364 --> 01:29:19.707]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:29:19.987 --> 01:29:22.709]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:29:23.009 --> 01:29:23.910]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:30:10.552 --> 01:30:19.900]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:20.160 --> 01:30:23.663]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:31:20.351 --> 01:31:23.353]  Everybody understands the importance of keeping their arteries clear.
[01:31:23.453 --> 01:31:27.977]  But did you know that in 25% of the cases, the first symptom of blocked arteries isn't?
[01:31:28.217 --> 01:31:28.618]  Death?
[01:31:28.738 --> 01:31:30.540]  Don't take unnecessary risks.

[01:32:11.559 --> 01:32:24.349]  We do have the Minutemen scheduled for the next hour, but if we can't get a hold of Hayworth because of a bad cell, we'll end up getting him on later and getting Minutemen on right now with Aaron Zellman, the chieftain over at Jews of the Preservation of Firearms Ownership.
[01:32:24.850 --> 01:32:29.554]  You don't have to be Jewish to be a member of this organization, and I recommend you join.
[01:32:29.594 --> 01:32:37.340]  It's one of the other good, few good Second Amendment groups out there, and they've now branched out into Citizens Against Police States and a lot of other great organizations.
[01:32:38.773 --> 01:32:41.075]  Great analysis, great information with Aaron Zellman.
[01:32:41.095 --> 01:32:43.136]  And again, I hope you get Innocence Betrayed.
[01:32:43.256 --> 01:32:44.017]  It's like $29.95.
[01:32:44.817 --> 01:32:55.044]  Comes with the three, same price as he's got it, comes with the three long-color comic books that go over the history of the Second Amendment or examples of how it's racist, gun-controlled.
[01:32:55.804 --> 01:32:56.585]  Really important.
[01:32:56.605 --> 01:32:57.305]  Good for adults.
[01:32:57.826 --> 01:32:58.886]  Good for children as well.
[01:32:58.926 --> 01:33:00.908]  But the video is so professionally produced.
[01:33:00.968 --> 01:33:01.188]  Get it?
[01:33:01.528 --> 01:33:04.490]  My new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police States out.
[01:33:06.283 --> 01:33:11.248]  $25.95, second copy $19.95, third copy $16.95, fourth copy $14.95, fifth copy $14.
[01:33:11.848 --> 01:33:18.474]  And the last film I made, American Dictators is amazing, $19.95, get a second copy for $5.95.
[01:33:19.415 --> 01:33:24.580]  A lot of big discounts we've got right now, exposing who was behind 9-11, how the globalists carried it out.
[01:33:25.961 --> 01:33:28.944]  My new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State,
[01:33:30.098 --> 01:33:30.959]  Is my best work.
[01:33:31.079 --> 01:33:41.990]  It covers who the globalists are, the Nazi connections, the police state they're setting up, skull and bones, even predates the Nazis, part of the same fool and truly secret society that Hitler was a member of.
[01:33:42.311 --> 01:33:44.453]  He would have his membership papers in there.
[01:33:44.493 --> 01:33:47.836]  We show how they're into death, destruction, power, black uniforms.
[01:33:48.116 --> 01:33:49.418]  We show all their own documents.
[01:33:50.819 --> 01:33:52.480]  And that's at the end of the film, the last hour.
[01:33:52.540 --> 01:33:55.062]  The middle hour is 9-11 and how they carried it out.
[01:33:55.523 --> 01:34:00.907]  The first 35 minutes or so is the police state in New York, people being put in a FEMA camp, just everything.
[01:34:01.668 --> 01:34:05.691]  This is a film you've absolutely got to have, toll-free number to order it, 1-888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:34:15.054 --> 01:34:20.276]  We're going to prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order hard copies via the safe, secure online shopping carts.
[01:34:20.577 --> 01:34:21.697]  We've got clips of the films.
[01:34:21.757 --> 01:34:25.479]  I mean, in many cases, half the film will be up there.
[01:34:25.659 --> 01:34:31.261]  44 Minutes of American Dictators, an hour and a half of Martial Law, 9-11 Rides of the Police State.
[01:34:31.281 --> 01:34:31.902]  You can download it.
[01:34:31.962 --> 01:34:34.183]  Go to prisonplanet.tv, watch the whole thing.
[01:34:34.383 --> 01:34:36.524]  My other 11 films, dozens of other films.
[01:34:36.864 --> 01:34:39.665]  My book, Paul Watson's book, his e-books, my weekly TV reports.
[01:34:40.405 --> 01:34:43.327]  15 cents a day, monthly, yearly subscriptions at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:34:45.453 --> 01:34:47.174]  And folks, if you can tell, I'm fired up.
[01:34:47.214 --> 01:34:49.894]  It's because so much is happening.
[01:34:49.974 --> 01:34:50.895]  So much is going on.
[01:34:50.915 --> 01:34:55.176]  Again, we have Aaron Zellman, Jews Preservation Firearms ownership, with us, riding shotgun.
[01:34:55.196 --> 01:34:56.096]  We're about to go back to him.
[01:34:56.376 --> 01:34:57.937]  We do have Congressman J.D.
[01:34:58.237 --> 01:35:07.000]  Hayworth, who's on the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus, chaired by a frequent guest of this program, Congressman Tom Tancredo.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:11.881]  And Congressman Hayworth joins us via his car on his cell phone.
[01:35:12.241 --> 01:35:14.322]  Congressman, thanks for coming on on such short notice.
[01:35:14.952 --> 01:35:16.392]  Well, thanks for having me on today.
[01:35:16.432 --> 01:35:17.253]  It's good to be with you.
[01:35:17.813 --> 01:35:18.533]  You bet, sir.
[01:35:21.414 --> 01:35:22.854]  This news came out.
[01:35:22.894 --> 01:35:24.995]  It's no surprise to me, but it is to most people.
[01:35:25.855 --> 01:35:28.896]  The Border Patrol is standing down, and I've read that you're outraged by this.
[01:35:29.716 --> 01:35:40.379]  Well, it's just, once again, like so much about our border policy or our lack thereof, it is just another insane notion.
[01:35:41.314 --> 01:35:56.087]  That the Border Patrol, to try and show up the Minutemen project, would actually say not to arrest illegals, just, it sadly fits into a pattern.
[01:35:56.828 --> 01:36:07.698]  And it's just, it just is breathtakingly stupid in the wake of 9-11, in the wake of the fact that we're a nation at war,
[01:36:08.584 --> 01:36:09.445]  We're good to go.
[01:36:09.465 --> 01:36:11.066]  We're good to go.
[01:36:28.797 --> 01:36:30.438]  It just defies all logic.
[01:36:30.478 --> 01:36:35.461]  Well, Border Patrol Chief David V. Aguilar, Congressman J.D.
[01:36:35.581 --> 01:36:47.827]  Hayworth, he's out here saying, oh, we never said this, but I had the Border Patrol Union Chief on last year, and he said they've basically been told to stand down, that Border Patrol units can only look south or north or east or west.
[01:36:47.867 --> 01:36:50.388]  If they see illegals on one side of them, they can't arrest them.
[01:36:50.588 --> 01:36:55.291]  They're ordered three or four hours a day to pick up trash, and during that duty, not stop illegals.
[01:36:55.691 --> 01:36:57.012]  I mean, you talk about insane...
[01:36:57.672 --> 01:37:04.176]  Our own president, with the Democrats, wants this amnesty bill that he's been pushing for four and a half years now, sir.
[01:37:04.956 --> 01:37:07.157]  So, I mean, let's be frank.
[01:37:07.237 --> 01:37:14.001]  I mean, I know you're in the leadership of the Republican Party, but we're sick of George Bush and Vicente Fox being in this love fest.
[01:37:14.701 --> 01:37:16.002]  Well, the bottom line is this.
[01:37:16.182 --> 01:37:20.525]  I'm a Republican, but I tell you what, I'm an American first.
[01:37:21.245 --> 01:37:24.707]  And I have made very clear to the White House and to this president
[01:37:25.979 --> 01:37:33.544]  My real concerns about the notion of what's happening on the border right now and the inaction... Here's the bottom line.
[01:37:34.164 --> 01:37:42.770]  You know, we hear about the actions taken in Al Anbar province in Iraq now to deal with the influx of terrorists.
[01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:43.930]  They're putting a fence up!
[01:37:44.351 --> 01:37:45.711]  Yeah, they're putting a fence up there.
[01:37:45.992 --> 01:37:47.352]  Now, it's real simple to me.
[01:37:47.733 --> 01:37:54.837]  If we're willing to spend billions of dollars enforcing the borders of Iraq and enforcing the borders of Afghanistan...
[01:37:55.453 --> 01:37:57.834]  Shouldn't we be doing the same right here at home?
[01:37:58.394 --> 01:38:04.837]  And the reason why, of course, is with all the debate going on about first responders, hey, here's a real simple notion.
[01:38:05.217 --> 01:38:11.419]  If you have first defenders on our borders, maybe you won't need first responders.
[01:38:12.239 --> 01:38:14.040]  And that's the bottom line on this.
[01:38:14.100 --> 01:38:19.302]  We're a nation at war, not to sow the seeds of panic, but just to understand the nature of the threat.
[01:38:19.775 --> 01:38:34.884]  When you have the head of the CIA speaking to an open session to a Senate committee, saying one of his biggest fears is somebody... A suitcase nuke coming across the southern border, or mass shooters to target schools.
[01:38:35.484 --> 01:38:36.465]  That's exactly right.
[01:38:36.505 --> 01:38:37.085]  You have that.
[01:38:37.186 --> 01:38:44.550]  You had the FBI director a few weeks ago in front of John Culbertson's House subcommittee, and the FBI director confirmed...
[01:38:45.034 --> 01:38:50.477]  That you have, you know, we have these wonderful bureaucratic acronyms, the OTMs, other than Mexicans.
[01:38:50.997 --> 01:38:52.939]  You have folks coming across our border.
[01:38:53.379 --> 01:38:55.300]  I shouldn't even say folk, that sounds too nice.
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:57.181]  You have people coming across the border.
[01:38:57.201 --> 01:38:58.222]  By the thousands a month.
[01:38:59.082 --> 01:39:05.866]  From nation states that export Islamic terrorism, and they're adopting Hispanic aliases.
[01:39:06.006 --> 01:39:06.326]  Why?
[01:39:06.346 --> 01:39:10.469]  To blend in with this overall illegal invasion.
[01:39:10.509 --> 01:39:12.730]  There are three reasons we should be concerned about this.
[01:39:13.294 --> 01:39:14.955]  Number one, national security.
[01:39:15.235 --> 01:39:16.736]  Number two, national security.
[01:39:16.976 --> 01:39:18.677]  And number three, national security.
[01:39:18.717 --> 01:39:24.400]  When you have this glaring a weakness, our enemies don't have to be omniscient or omnipotent.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:35.486]  Well, Congressman, doesn't it... I know you've got to go in about three or four minutes, but doesn't it make the war on terror a complete fraud if our northern and southern border, the northern's really bad too, are totally wide open?
[01:39:36.266 --> 01:39:39.208]  Look, we've got problems on both borders.
[01:39:40.068 --> 01:39:41.609]  And we have to decide...
[01:39:42.631 --> 01:39:44.312]  Are we going to be serious about this?
[01:39:44.893 --> 01:39:50.617]  Are we going to devote the resources necessary to protect the United States of America and to protect Americans?
[01:39:51.098 --> 01:40:03.027]  Are we going to go with this kind of half-baked notion that, well, we're going to let some people in to have a cheap workforce and we're going to kind of go to a quasi-open border notion?
[01:40:03.448 --> 01:40:12.295]  In the wake of 9-11 and the fact we're a nation at war, it's obvious to me we cannot allow the forest nature of our borders north and south
[01:40:12.555 --> 01:40:15.960]  To continue, we do so at our own risk.
[01:40:28.419 --> 01:40:31.922]  Well, it's almost the approach is confusing and confounding and it lacks any coherence.
[01:40:58.649 --> 01:41:02.476]  The fact is we have to identify what problems we see.
[01:41:02.997 --> 01:41:05.682]  Those problems are coming to our borders.
[01:41:06.203 --> 01:41:10.872]  We are living in a delusional fashion if we ignore that.
[01:41:12.303 --> 01:41:21.788]  Congressman, do you think that this Border Patrol chief or whoever gave these orders, and I guarantee it came from the White House, do you think they should be removed, the people on the Border Patrol that gave these orders?
[01:41:22.408 --> 01:41:24.910]  I believe we better find out what's going on.
[01:41:24.930 --> 01:41:29.232]  And when I get back, I'm going to talk to Chris Cox, probably put a formal request in writing.
[01:41:29.713 --> 01:41:32.074]  Chris is the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.
[01:41:32.614 --> 01:41:34.956]  One of the congressional responsibilities is oversight.
[01:41:35.276 --> 01:41:36.597]  We're going to get to the bottom of this.
[01:41:36.897 --> 01:41:40.199]  And, you know, just icing on the cake, I don't know if you remember earlier this week,
[01:41:40.816 --> 01:41:57.048]  But when Secretary Chertoff was here a couple weeks ago, they actually barred Chris Simcox, one of the guys in the Minutemen movement, the editor of the Tombstone newspaper, they barred him from a press conference, they said, for security reasons.
[01:41:57.489 --> 01:41:59.270]  Something is seriously wrong.
[01:41:59.370 --> 01:42:01.632]  I've written Chertoff saying, what's going on here?
[01:42:01.892 --> 01:42:05.515]  And the fact is, Congress better utilize its oversight.
[01:42:05.535 --> 01:42:09.578]  Well, they're using the terror threat to stifle free speech of a pro-America group.
[01:42:10.599 --> 01:42:17.122]  I mean, the true name of the Minutemen, that's just their catchphrase name, is Homeland Civil Defense.
[01:42:17.382 --> 01:42:19.522]  They're doing what the President asked them to do.
[01:42:19.542 --> 01:42:34.468]  That is exactly right, and we are going to have to have a coherent policy, and if the White House fails to generate it, those of us on immigration reform are going to have a comprehensive bill to answer this curious piece of legislation.
[01:42:34.488 --> 01:42:39.630]  What about Ron Paul's bill to bar people that come here and have children from getting automatic citizenship?
[01:42:40.262 --> 01:42:41.783]  No, we absolutely need to do that.
[01:42:42.244 --> 01:42:44.326]  Okay, I've got one or two more final questions.
[01:42:44.366 --> 01:42:45.987]  I know Aaron Zellman's got one for you, Congressman.
[01:42:46.007 --> 01:42:47.108]  We've got a good sell right now.
[01:42:47.128 --> 01:42:49.430]  I know you're visiting a sick family member on the road right now.
[01:42:49.691 --> 01:42:53.714]  We appreciate it, but I believe we had a caller when he heard you were coming on who's been holding ever since.
[01:42:53.774 --> 01:42:56.737]  Is Ron, the police officer from New York, is he still there?
[01:42:57.495 --> 01:42:58.216]  Let's bring Ron up.
[01:42:58.256 --> 01:43:01.040]  He's got a question for you out of the New York Times today.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:02.041]  Congressman J.D.
[01:43:02.061 --> 01:43:03.623]  Hayworth calling from New York.
[01:43:03.984 --> 01:43:04.725]  Ron, the policeman.
[01:43:05.185 --> 01:43:07.448]  Ron, you've got about 30, 40 seconds with the congressman.
[01:43:07.689 --> 01:43:08.330]  Ask your question.
[01:43:08.630 --> 01:43:11.494]  Yes, Congressman, and that's a retired officer from New York.
[01:43:11.534 --> 01:43:12.055]  Good afternoon.
[01:43:12.915 --> 01:43:25.702]  You mentioned bureaucracy, bungling bureaucrats, but if we have supervisors within that federal agency who in fact are instructing their men to do things in violation of our laws, is it not more than bureaucracy?
[01:43:25.762 --> 01:43:26.702]  Is it not criminal?
[01:43:26.742 --> 01:43:28.243]  Is it not official misconduct?
[01:43:28.323 --> 01:43:32.305]  And should it not be addressed in those more serious terms if this is what occurred?
[01:43:33.046 --> 01:43:37.888]  Ron, you raise an absolutely valid and very strong point, sir.
[01:43:38.348 --> 01:43:41.330]  If there is wrongdoing, this is dereliction of duty
[01:43:42.017 --> 01:43:44.939]  And failing to enforce our laws.
[01:43:45.480 --> 01:43:49.002]  And it should carry with it very serious consequences.
[01:43:49.042 --> 01:43:50.063]  Federal felonies!
[01:43:50.443 --> 01:43:50.963]  Absolutely.
[01:43:51.224 --> 01:43:51.704]  That's right.
[01:43:51.904 --> 01:43:52.785]  Official misconduct.
[01:43:52.825 --> 01:43:54.126]  This is official misconduct.
[01:43:54.726 --> 01:43:55.947]  In my own right, Ron.
[01:43:56.644 --> 01:44:00.526]  Former agency, if I omitted to do what was my lawful duty, that's a crime.
[01:44:00.726 --> 01:44:06.008]  Now, Ron, you called in and said you wanted to bring up something about the New York Times and a bill that the Congressman has.
[01:44:06.308 --> 01:44:06.608]  Oh, yes.
[01:44:06.928 --> 01:44:11.931]  It's not the Congressman's bill, but it's his colleagues on the Senate side, McKinney, Kennedy, and it's in the Sun.
[01:44:12.531 --> 01:44:16.032]  They introduced an immigration reform bill, but it's really not reform.
[01:44:16.092 --> 01:44:17.433]  It's a rose by any other name.
[01:44:18.574 --> 01:44:20.555]  They're going to allow chain immigration.
[01:44:20.575 --> 01:44:26.859]  They're going to allow people who are here illegally to get legitimized status by paying $2,000 and paying back taxes.
[01:44:27.420 --> 01:44:29.621]  American citizenship shouldn't be for sale.
[01:44:29.661 --> 01:44:32.023]  We'll make clear your question.
[01:44:32.083 --> 01:44:33.164]  My question is, okay...
[01:44:34.085 --> 01:44:39.608]  What is his position on that, and what is his position on that bill, which is now being floated by his Senate colleagues?
[01:44:40.048 --> 01:44:41.929]  McCain is... Because I misunderstood you when you called in.
[01:44:41.949 --> 01:44:43.210]  You said, I want his bill.
[01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.710]  Okay, good.
[01:44:44.071 --> 01:44:44.271]  Right.
[01:44:44.291 --> 01:44:48.033]  Yeah, I'm in profound disagreement.
[01:44:48.553 --> 01:44:48.853]  Good.
[01:44:49.293 --> 01:44:52.715]  Fellow Arizonans with Senator McCain and, of course, with Senator Kennedy.
[01:44:53.075 --> 01:44:54.776]  This is not immigration reform.
[01:44:55.137 --> 01:44:57.198]  This is immigration redefinition.
[01:44:57.358 --> 01:44:58.759]  Well, it's similar to Bush's plan.
[01:44:59.219 --> 01:45:01.120]  Yeah, look, the bottom line is this.
[01:45:02.167 --> 01:45:06.909]  All these things, they can try to deny it and use this Orwellian newspeak.
[01:45:07.349 --> 01:45:08.910]  It is all amnesty.
[01:45:09.290 --> 01:45:10.750]  It should be rejected.
[01:45:11.611 --> 01:45:12.731]  Okay, last question.
[01:45:13.031 --> 01:45:13.932]  Ron, thanks for the call.
[01:45:14.332 --> 01:45:17.153]  Aaron Zellman, Chairman of Jews in Preservation and Firearms Ownership.
[01:45:17.373 --> 01:45:18.553]  Do you have a final question?
[01:45:18.573 --> 01:45:21.254]  I appreciate you holding for the good Congressman J.D.
[01:45:21.274 --> 01:45:21.654]  Hayworth.
[01:45:22.255 --> 01:45:24.235]  Yes, I do, and I appreciate the opportunity.
[01:45:25.576 --> 01:45:31.438]  To get right to the point, as you know, in the last few days, the National ID card was passed
[01:45:33.170 --> 01:45:33.970]  To establish it.
[01:45:33.990 --> 01:45:37.471]  Do you think there's any people in Congress who are going to fight this?
[01:45:38.571 --> 01:45:49.774]  Well, there are a lot of people out there fighting, but Aaron, if you're talking about having biometric identifiers or a standardized way to have driver's licenses, it's perhaps when we part company.
[01:45:49.814 --> 01:45:57.576]  Look, I want to preserve civil liberties, but when you have driver's licenses becoming de facto ID cards...
[01:45:58.321 --> 01:46:02.483]  The fact is, we have to find a way, and there's a natural tension that exists.
[01:46:03.304 --> 01:46:06.045]  Ben Franklin spoke about it during the Constitutional Convention.
[01:46:06.645 --> 01:46:08.666]  Liberty and security.
[01:46:09.387 --> 01:46:11.147]  Oftentimes, they seem to be at odds.
[01:46:11.388 --> 01:46:18.271]  I don't want to surrender constitutional rights, and this is a question... No, he said when you give up liberty, you don't get security, and you don't deserve it, Congressman.
[01:46:18.471 --> 01:46:21.252]  Well, yeah, here's the situation, though.
[01:46:21.773 --> 01:46:24.294]  We have to decide, as a people...
[01:46:25.394 --> 01:46:37.847]  Are we going to allow those who would abuse our rights, or let me just put it to you this way, and maybe we need to do a whole hour on this sometimes, Alex, because I think it's a legitimate portion of debate.
[01:46:38.533 --> 01:46:45.016]  I hope and pray we will take actions to prevent another 9-11, because I believe if it comes, it will be to the 100th power.
[01:46:45.357 --> 01:46:54.701]  And you know what is scarier to me would be the knee-jerk reaction in the wake of another attack where people would willingly surrender almost all their civil liberties.
[01:46:55.061 --> 01:46:56.382]  Aaron's right to raise the question.
[01:46:56.402 --> 01:46:57.763]  Well, that's what Tommy Frank said.
[01:46:57.803 --> 01:47:02.165]  He said, one more major attack, we're going to sign over to a military dictatorship.
[01:47:02.385 --> 01:47:07.988]  And we don't want that to happen, but the question has to be for men and women of goodwill
[01:47:08.686 --> 01:47:15.167]  Who want to see constitutional rights preserved, are there actions that we are willing to take in wartime?
[01:47:15.247 --> 01:47:16.308]  Well, Congressman, let me just stop you.
[01:47:16.628 --> 01:47:17.808]  Let me just stop you.
[01:47:17.968 --> 01:47:36.772]  We had Congressman Ron Paul, the most conservative record in Congress, your colleague from the district here in Texas, and he's analyzed the bill, and it's a huge database for citizens, hooks into the Total Information Awareness Network under another name, Bush wants free health care for the illegals and tuition, and all this, and it's going to be selectively enforced, and...
[01:47:37.732 --> 01:47:40.016]  And it federalizes the IDs at the state level.
[01:47:40.116 --> 01:47:44.362]  I agree the state should be doing something, but the answer is, you know, don't jump into the pit.
[01:47:44.502 --> 01:47:45.083]  Aaron Zellman?
[01:47:46.004 --> 01:47:48.207]  Well, I think I agree with you, Alex.
[01:47:48.267 --> 01:47:53.495]  I think that this is, you know, there's the term unintended consequences.
[01:47:54.224 --> 01:47:58.245]  And I think that this ID concept is going to lead right down that path.
[01:47:58.265 --> 01:48:01.687]  Congressman, can I get you on in the next few weeks to speak?
[01:48:01.707 --> 01:48:11.410]  We'll come back and discuss this, because you've absolutely put your finger on a point that is vital to discuss and to talk about and to do so as men and women of goodwill.
[01:48:11.770 --> 01:48:16.975]  We want to preserve constitutional liberty, and at the same time want to protect this country.
[01:48:17.015 --> 01:48:23.261]  Well, you just mentioned Chertoff blocking the head of the Minutemen from a press conference for security.
[01:48:23.281 --> 01:48:34.331]  I mean, these guys are... Look, it's Bush's border patrol that's saying stand down, and everything he does is for open borders with the Democrats who want this and the Ford Foundation, and then Bush is supporting the national ID card.
[01:48:34.531 --> 01:48:35.332]  You can't trust it.
[01:48:36.676 --> 01:48:41.120]  Well, we've got a big discussion to have, and I'm not here to defend the President.
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:54.570]  What I am here to say is there are reasonable actions that can be taken in wartime, and I understand the concerns everybody has, but it's also true that Mr. Justice Jackson told us the Constitution is not a suicide act.
[01:48:54.875 --> 01:49:08.003]  We have to be very leery of those who have utilized... Well, if our Border Patrol was allowed to do its job, and if our government wasn't running around doing all of this stuff, then the excuse to have this wouldn't be necessary.
[01:49:08.723 --> 01:49:17.567]  Point well taken, Alex, and on that we'll agree, and I look forward to joining you again, because this is a discussion we need to have, and I credit you and Aaron for raising the issue.
[01:49:17.587 --> 01:49:18.467]  Okay, Congressman J.D.
[01:49:18.507 --> 01:49:19.788]  Hayworth, I'm going to keep you to that.
[01:49:20.028 --> 01:49:21.929]  I want to have you on for a full hour very soon.
[01:49:21.949 --> 01:49:22.509]  Thanks for the time.
[01:49:22.989 --> 01:49:23.709]  Look forward to it.
[01:49:23.749 --> 01:49:24.430]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:49:24.650 --> 01:49:25.110]  Take care.
[01:49:25.650 --> 01:49:28.191]  Aaron Zellman, I tell you, he's slick, isn't he?
[01:49:28.211 --> 01:49:30.832]  He is slick.
[01:49:30.993 --> 01:49:31.913]  That guy is slick.
[01:49:33.019 --> 01:49:33.539]  Oh, boy.
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:35.521]  Well, actually not, Alex.
[01:49:35.741 --> 01:49:35.961]  I know.
[01:49:36.001 --> 01:49:36.441]  Well, you know what?
[01:49:36.461 --> 01:49:38.122]  I'll let you respond to it on the other side, my friend.
[01:49:38.402 --> 01:49:44.086]  He brought his shotgun with us, and your calls are coming up as well with Aaron Zellman, and we've got the Minutemen joining us as well.
[01:49:48.166 --> 01:49:49.688]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:49.868 --> 01:49:52.952]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:53.092 --> 01:49:56.996]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:49:57.036 --> 01:50:01.281]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:01.621 --> 01:50:05.406]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:05.626 --> 01:50:07.328]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:07.628 --> 01:50:10.829]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:10.869 --> 01:50:15.591]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:15.751 --> 01:50:18.792]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:50:18.972 --> 01:50:21.833]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:22.313 --> 01:50:28.435]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:28.955 --> 01:50:31.077]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:49.116 --> 01:51:00.387]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:51:00.587 --> 01:51:07.053]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:51:07.293 --> 01:51:13.099]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.

[01:52:48.879 --> 01:52:51.641]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:51.661 --> 01:52:55.484]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:52:59.719 --> 01:53:05.040]  I know we haven't been taking a lot of calls today because we've had so many guests on.
[01:53:06.581 --> 01:53:07.941]  We've been playing so many clips.
[01:53:08.241 --> 01:53:10.161]  There's more clips coming up in the next hour.
[01:53:10.181 --> 01:53:13.442]  And we're going to have the Minutemen on for about 15-20 minutes with us.
[01:53:13.462 --> 01:53:16.263]  And Aaron Zellman is going to be riding shotgun with us.
[01:53:18.083 --> 01:53:21.584]  But Aaron, we always have better discussions during the break than we do even on air.
[01:53:21.924 --> 01:53:24.205]  Kind of repeat some of the things you were saying during the break.
[01:53:24.625 --> 01:53:25.285]  I agree with them.
[01:53:26.245 --> 01:53:29.186]  Well, I think we should start with the guest you had, the congressman.
[01:53:31.226 --> 01:53:32.647]  You thought he was slick.
[01:53:32.687 --> 01:53:33.388]  I don't think so.
[01:53:34.269 --> 01:53:41.438]  I think that when asked simple, direct questions, there were no simple, direct answers.
[01:53:41.618 --> 01:53:46.243]  I find that to be of great concern.
[01:53:46.283 --> 01:53:47.104]  Have good will.
[01:53:47.184 --> 01:53:48.185]  Trust your government.
[01:53:50.547 --> 01:53:52.408]  If you're a fool, sure, go ahead.
[01:53:52.468 --> 01:53:58.451]  He tried to misquote, by slick, he tried to misquote Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin.
[01:53:58.911 --> 01:54:03.034]  Yeah, well, you know, that's nothing surprising.
[01:54:03.234 --> 01:54:06.035]  Although he may not have misquoted, he just may not have understood them.
[01:54:06.876 --> 01:54:10.197]  I mean, I wonder when the last time Mr. Mann read the Bill of Rights.
[01:54:11.798 --> 01:54:13.319]  That would be a good question to ask him.
[01:54:13.719 --> 01:54:17.241]  Well, the Constitution has provisions to protect the border.
[01:54:17.261 --> 01:54:18.762]  They're not doing that and then telling us...
[01:54:19.602 --> 01:54:21.763]  All they're going to do is just give these cards to the illegals.
[01:54:21.783 --> 01:54:22.323]  They've already said it.
[01:54:22.343 --> 01:54:23.344]  They're just going to legalize them.
[01:54:24.345 --> 01:54:26.906]  Well, I think the question needs to be raised, Alex, is why?
[01:54:26.926 --> 01:54:29.347]  I mean, what is the real reason?
[01:54:29.367 --> 01:54:30.628]  What is the real motivation?
[01:54:30.648 --> 01:54:31.888]  They want us at each other's throats.
[01:54:32.749 --> 01:54:35.050]  Well, and why do they want us at each other's throats?
[01:54:36.891 --> 01:54:37.791]  Divide and conquer.
[01:54:39.112 --> 01:54:46.456]  And I guess the next question is, you know, what do they gain by divide and conquer of the masses, of Americans?
[01:54:48.342 --> 01:54:50.123]  They get the monopoly of power.
[01:54:50.143 --> 01:54:52.304]  You know, the control freaks, the puppet masters.
[01:54:52.324 --> 01:54:55.326]  I mean, what's in it for them to play this game?
[01:54:56.666 --> 01:54:59.088]  Well, we're busy worrying about each other as a diversion.
[01:54:59.108 --> 01:55:00.128]  They're busy dominating.
[01:55:00.628 --> 01:55:04.390]  Well, we get back to what government's all about.
[01:55:04.650 --> 01:55:06.972]  If it's not under their control, it's out of control.
[01:55:06.992 --> 01:55:09.153]  Aaron, I'm not kidding when I say this.
[01:55:10.554 --> 01:55:15.176]  I had a major police chief on from New Jersey yesterday who just took an implantable chip.
[01:55:16.027 --> 01:55:19.029]  He's recommending the hospitals put chip readers in and his officers take it.
[01:55:19.529 --> 01:55:21.470]  And I said, if the government... He said, this is a big brother.
[01:55:21.510 --> 01:55:22.911]  I said, well, what if they order us to do it?
[01:55:22.951 --> 01:55:24.992]  Which the feds are talking about some of their documents.
[01:55:25.973 --> 01:55:27.254]  He said, yeah, I'll be all for it.
[01:55:27.314 --> 01:55:30.696]  I mean, you'll enforce Alex Jones having to take a chip.
[01:55:30.716 --> 01:55:31.416]  And he's like, yeah.
[01:55:32.417 --> 01:55:34.678]  I mean, that is body snatcher crazy.
[01:55:35.999 --> 01:55:42.783]  Well, I would hope that people are listening to this, Alex, because if they're not alarmed... I mean, if they're not losing sleep at night over this...
[01:55:43.737 --> 01:55:49.942]  Then maybe they need to go live in some other country because they're a very poor excuse for a true American.
[01:55:51.403 --> 01:55:53.264]  I know I'm probably going to make some people unhappy with that.
[01:55:53.284 --> 01:55:55.566]  I don't think they have any idea what tyranny is like.
[01:55:55.606 --> 01:55:56.987]  This is serious business.
[01:55:57.868 --> 01:55:58.628]  Well, I can tell you.
[01:55:59.449 --> 01:56:03.732]  We recently had a fellow who translated the Bill of Rights into Romanian.
[01:56:04.452 --> 01:56:06.934]  He lived in Romania underneath Ceausescu.
[01:56:07.975 --> 01:56:11.838]  He said the American people... He's been in America about 26 years.
[01:56:11.878 --> 01:56:13.139]  He said the American people...
[01:56:14.031 --> 01:56:19.054]  Do not understand this step-by-step jackboot approach.
[01:56:19.814 --> 01:56:28.199]  He said of the national ID card passing the other day, he says the American people don't have a clue as to the implications of what will come out of this.
[01:56:28.279 --> 01:56:29.960]  They think it's just a card in their wallet.
[01:56:30.000 --> 01:56:32.862]  No, it's a giant database and you've got to have it to do anything.
[01:56:33.122 --> 01:56:35.844]  It means internal checkpoints, as Congressman Paul said.
[01:56:36.444 --> 01:56:39.866]  It's not only that, but it's a database that they can manipulate.
[01:56:40.689 --> 01:56:45.433]  And so when you go to the grocery store to buy food, they say, nope, you're not authorized to buy food this week.
[01:56:45.593 --> 01:56:46.874]  And that's already starting.
[01:56:46.894 --> 01:56:48.435]  They're already talking about doing that.
[01:56:49.095 --> 01:56:55.440]  So I can tell you that the people who think that this is, you know, for this congressperson, what was his name, Harding or Hardin?
[01:56:56.381 --> 01:56:58.002]  Yeah, it's J.D.
[01:56:58.042 --> 01:56:58.502]  Hayworth.
[01:56:58.582 --> 01:56:59.303]  Oh, Hayworth, okay.
[01:56:59.343 --> 01:57:00.343]  He's a big chairman.
[01:57:00.624 --> 01:57:01.284]  All right, okay.
[01:57:02.305 --> 01:57:05.107]  I mean, for him not to understand this issue...
[01:57:06.455 --> 01:57:11.956]  Makes me wonder, just... Yeah, I was saying he was good with the other issues, then he drops this ID card thing on us.
[01:57:12.916 --> 01:57:21.418]  Yeah, well, let me tell you, this ID card thing comes from my Congress critter, Jim Sensenbrenner, who everybody thinks is so good on the issues.
[01:57:21.438 --> 01:57:22.759]  Aaron, stay there.
[01:57:22.839 --> 01:57:26.379]  We've got the Minutemen joining us, and we're going to take some calls, and I really appreciate you.
[01:57:26.619 --> 01:57:33.421]  And later we're going to plug JPFO.org and how people can become members of one of the few good Second Amendment groups out there.
[01:57:33.441 --> 01:57:33.981]  We'll be right back.
[01:57:44.537 --> 01:57:45.178]  Big Brother.
[01:57:45.838 --> 01:57:46.899]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:47.620 --> 01:57:48.721]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:49.362 --> 01:57:50.203]  You want answers?
[01:57:50.943 --> 01:57:51.884]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:52.525 --> 01:57:56.188]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:56.709 --> 01:58:00.833]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:00.953 --> 01:58:07.119]  The federal government has passed the Super Control Grid National ID card.
[01:58:07.859 --> 01:58:09.521]  Ron Paul even called it a control grid.
[01:58:10.859 --> 01:58:14.281]  Homeland Security even uses the words control grid and tracking grid.
[01:58:15.121 --> 01:58:15.882]  It's a grid.
[01:58:16.382 --> 01:58:18.203]  Now we've had callers holding for over an hour.
[01:58:18.223 --> 01:58:24.586]  We're going to take a few of those in this five-minute segment, come back, and with Aaron Zellman riding shotgun with us in this segment as well.
[01:58:25.106 --> 01:58:31.690]  But we're going to talk to the folks from the Minutemen who are being banned from press conferences under Homeland Security orders by Chertoff.
[01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:33.571]  Public press conferences.
[01:58:33.591 --> 01:58:36.012]  You just can't come in and tell the press, Homeland Security.
[01:58:37.208 --> 01:58:39.748]  You heard Congressman Hayworth talking about that last hour.
[01:58:40.109 --> 01:58:42.269]  We have the Border Patrol being ordered to stand down.
[01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:46.030]  Twelve Border Patrol agents have told the Washington Times this.
[01:58:47.430 --> 01:58:50.930]  Aaron Zellman, I mean, this shows what a fraud the war on terror is.
[01:58:54.351 --> 01:58:55.931]  I'm sorry, can you rephrase that?
[01:58:55.951 --> 01:59:05.633]  No, I'm saying, the fact that they're saying, leave the borders totally open, covertly, while telling us to give up all of our rights and have national ID cards, it shows what a fraud this war is.
[01:59:07.378 --> 01:59:10.200]  Well, I think this war has been a fraud.
[01:59:10.220 --> 01:59:12.601]  This war on terror, if you want to call it that.
[01:59:13.121 --> 01:59:14.622]  It's been a fraud from day one.
[01:59:15.643 --> 01:59:27.249]  Just the simple task of looking at what's being overlooked or not being done intentionally or where they're not focusing their energies and efforts.
[01:59:27.269 --> 01:59:29.350]  The Homeland Security folks.
[01:59:31.611 --> 01:59:32.732]  It is a big fraud.
[01:59:32.832 --> 01:59:36.694]  It's amazing how many people want to believe that their government...
[01:59:37.165 --> 01:59:38.426]  We'll do the right thing for them.
[01:59:38.446 --> 01:59:39.907]  Their government will not harm them.
[01:59:40.728 --> 01:59:46.452]  And these folks are going to be slaves because they bought into the fraud.
[01:59:47.252 --> 01:59:49.314]  And they think the slave trade will take good care of them.
[01:59:49.334 --> 01:59:50.595]  That couldn't be further from the truth.
[01:59:50.635 --> 01:59:52.096]  Regina in Pennsylvania.
[01:59:52.136 --> 01:59:52.976]  Welcome, Regina.
[01:59:53.697 --> 01:59:56.659]  Alex, wonderful job you two with Congressman Hayworth.
[01:59:56.899 --> 01:59:57.079]  Thanks.
[01:59:57.099 --> 01:59:59.081]  It's been a long time, Alex, so pray for me.
[02:00:00.864 --> 02:00:04.525]  I wanted to mention here this real ID card.
[02:00:04.965 --> 02:00:08.246]  I started out here with what's going on in the border.
[02:00:08.626 --> 02:00:09.466]  Let's face it, Alex.
[02:00:09.506 --> 02:00:13.907]  The globalists got exactly what they wanted with this real ID card.
[02:00:14.407 --> 02:00:19.908]  So now they can just use that opportunity to shut down what they need to do.
[02:00:19.968 --> 02:00:22.269]  I want to hold up the flag here real high, Alex.
[02:00:22.349 --> 02:00:23.389]  I hope you'll listen me out.
[02:00:24.469 --> 02:00:25.009]  CASTA.
[02:00:25.429 --> 02:00:26.470]  That's where we are, Alex.
[02:00:27.010 --> 02:00:27.570]  And we have
[02:00:28.519 --> 02:00:31.341]  Latin American presidents lobbying Congress for trade pact.
[02:00:31.361 --> 02:00:33.662]  I wish you would have let me on with Hayworth, because I would have asked him.
[02:00:33.682 --> 02:00:35.183]  Did they come to his door?
[02:00:35.423 --> 02:00:40.725]  Did they ask him to pass the Free Trade of the Americas, the CAFTA?
[02:00:41.006 --> 02:00:42.186]  And what's he going to do about it?
[02:00:42.286 --> 02:00:49.410]  Because, you know, he gave us the real idea of a solution to shutting out Chris Simcox and what Ron brought up.
[02:00:49.790 --> 02:00:51.511]  And Terry Anderson would not listen.
[02:00:52.312 --> 02:00:56.734]  And then again, for those that don't know, for those that don't understand, this is key.
[02:00:58.385 --> 02:01:00.226]  This is a Pan-American Union.
[02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:01.447]  That's how the EU started.
[02:01:01.467 --> 02:01:02.968]  It was a, quote, economic community.
[02:01:03.188 --> 02:01:10.473]  They don't tell you until it's too late, but you watch C-SPAN when these boards are meeting, and they openly say the end of America.
[02:01:10.673 --> 02:01:12.374]  The Canadian papers are full of this.
[02:01:12.415 --> 02:01:13.695]  They don't want to give their sovereignty up.
[02:01:14.396 --> 02:01:15.517]  Aaron Zellman, comments?
[02:01:17.078 --> 02:01:24.903]  Well, you have to wonder why, from my perspective, why people who have benefited so much from America now want to destroy the country.
[02:01:26.958 --> 02:01:29.820]  I think that's an issue that people need to start talking about.
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:31.221]  This is where we live!
[02:01:31.261 --> 02:01:32.962]  This is all we've got!
[02:01:34.223 --> 02:01:37.566]  Yeah, you know, the idea of running away and going to some other country is not going to work.
[02:01:38.847 --> 02:01:45.713]  Because they probably are further along down the road of government control than we are here at the moment.
[02:01:46.873 --> 02:01:52.478]  But I think it just, again, it boggles the mind to think that there are people who have benefited so much.
[02:01:52.498 --> 02:01:54.940]  The Ford Foundation is an example, a Ford company.
[02:01:56.046 --> 02:02:00.688]  Why do they now want to undo everything that's good, or has been good about America?
[02:02:00.708 --> 02:02:01.908]  They've been working at it for decades.
[02:02:01.928 --> 02:02:02.668]  Well, take Argentina.
[02:02:02.848 --> 02:02:05.929]  Five years ago, they put in a national, six years ago, national ID card.
[02:02:06.389 --> 02:02:15.272]  After it was implemented, that's when the IMF and World Bank plunged it on purpose, once they had the control grid in, and we even got the IMF-World Bank documents, Aaron.
[02:02:17.725 --> 02:02:26.712]  Well, you know, I think that we're not going to undo this real quickly, but I think all stones have to be unturned to reach people and wake them up.
[02:02:27.313 --> 02:02:28.253]  Regina, anything else?
[02:02:28.273 --> 02:02:33.558]  I wanted to say something about Ron Paul's bill and the WTO and how we need to get... You know what?
[02:02:34.578 --> 02:02:36.860]  We'll come back to you real briefly later than the other callers.
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:37.721]  Stay with us, everybody.
[02:02:39.995 --> 02:02:44.322]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:44.502 --> 02:02:48.949]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:49.089 --> 02:02:53.476]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:53.516 --> 02:02:54.878]  The New World Order.
[02:02:56.639 --> 02:03:00.861]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:00.921 --> 02:03:07.863]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:07.983 --> 02:03:10.043]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:10.224 --> 02:03:20.727]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:20.747 --> 02:03:21.647]  If you want to understand
[02:03:21.667 --> 02:03:21.867]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:21.887 --> 02:03:22.768]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:03:40.726 --> 02:03:45.230]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:03:45.590 --> 02:03:49.673]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:03:49.973 --> 02:03:50.514]  We listened.
[02:03:50.814 --> 02:03:55.798]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:03:56.098 --> 02:03:56.559]  We listened.
[02:03:56.959 --> 02:04:00.001]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:04:00.422 --> 02:04:00.942]  We listened.
[02:04:01.423 --> 02:04:04.445]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[02:04:04.445 --> 02:04:05.085]  We're good to go.
[02:04:30.680 --> 02:04:32.302]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:32.322 --> 02:04:33.463]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:40.052 --> 02:04:45.574]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:04:45.714 --> 02:04:46.775]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:04:46.895 --> 02:04:47.775]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:04:47.895 --> 02:04:50.736]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:04:50.916 --> 02:04:55.778]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:04:56.039 --> 02:04:57.119]  Check out this new product.
[02:04:57.299 --> 02:05:00.180]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:05:00.540 --> 02:05:04.262]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:05:04.422 --> 02:05:06.903]  Look, the creator of No-B-O understands what you're going through.
[02:05:06.963 --> 02:05:07.664]  We're good to go.
[02:05:24.056 --> 02:05:26.940]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:30.004]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[02:05:30.204 --> 02:05:32.648]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[02:05:32.808 --> 02:05:36.112]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NoBO.
[02:05:36.293 --> 02:05:37.074]  That's no-bo.com.
[02:05:44.486 --> 02:05:45.127]  Big Brother.
[02:05:45.787 --> 02:05:46.848]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:47.568 --> 02:05:48.649]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:49.329 --> 02:05:50.150]  You want answers?
[02:05:50.890 --> 02:05:52.812]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:52.832 --> 02:05:56.094]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.654 --> 02:06:00.777]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:02.218 --> 02:06:04.600]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:06:04.700 --> 02:06:05.540]  Over and over again.
[02:06:05.580 --> 02:06:07.522]  They create the crisis of the open borders.
[02:06:08.142 --> 02:06:12.445]  They militarize and turn the illegals coming in into militants.
[02:06:13.385 --> 02:06:19.774]  They get all the big foundation and federal money, then the people cry out as their jobs plunge and as the society breaks down.
[02:06:19.794 --> 02:06:25.882]  The government's answer is a national ID card that Ron Paul's exposed will do nothing to stop the illegals.
[02:06:25.903 --> 02:06:27.965]  It will be selectively used against us.
[02:06:27.985 --> 02:06:30.429]  They'll then just pass amnesty and legalize all the illegals.
[02:06:32.572 --> 02:06:37.414]  And meanwhile, the Border Patrol is ordered to stand down directly from the highest levels of the Border Patrol.
[02:06:37.814 --> 02:06:39.555]  A dozen Border Patrol agents have gone public.
[02:06:39.635 --> 02:06:44.137]  I was told this a year ago when the president of the Border Patrol was on this radio broadcast.
[02:06:44.157 --> 02:06:45.737]  He said, look, we're already standing down.
[02:06:46.217 --> 02:06:48.398]  We're ordered to pick up trash three, four hours a day.
[02:06:48.418 --> 02:06:49.839]  We're not allowed to look north or south.
[02:06:50.479 --> 02:06:57.862]  They're parked one spot and told you can look this way, but if illegals walk right past you that way, you can't even apprehend them or call other Border Patrol to go after them.
[02:06:58.362 --> 02:06:59.823]  It's designed to fail.
[02:07:01.361 --> 02:07:07.523]  We've also got Aaron Zellman, Jewish Preservation and Firearms Ownership, riding shotgun with us today, talking about all these issues.
[02:07:08.483 --> 02:07:14.626]  Aaron, I guess the best way to start this is, do you have a question for Gray Deacon?
[02:07:15.366 --> 02:07:21.868]  Because I know we also need to ask about Homeland Security leader Chertoff, whose cousin writes hit pieces on me and others.
[02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:25.889]  You know, you can't come into the press conference because there's a security risk.
[02:07:25.929 --> 02:07:26.970]  You might be Al-Qaeda.
[02:07:27.450 --> 02:07:28.990]  I mean, this is insane.
[02:07:29.731 --> 02:07:30.611]  Gray Deacon, welcome.
[02:07:31.249 --> 02:07:33.230]  Oh, thank you very much for having me on the show today.
[02:07:33.610 --> 02:07:33.930]  You bet.
[02:07:34.030 --> 02:07:40.954]  Aaron, you can have the first question for Gray Deacon, the spokesman there and one of the chief managers there at the Minuteman Project.
[02:07:42.095 --> 02:07:45.956]  Well, first of all, Gray, let me commend you for everything you've been doing.
[02:07:45.976 --> 02:07:51.599]  As a kid, I was raised near the Mexican border in Tucson, Arizona.
[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:57.342]  And so I have a pretty good awareness of what's going on and has been going on for decades.
[02:07:58.523 --> 02:08:00.864]  And so I encourage you to keep doing what you're doing.
[02:08:01.758 --> 02:08:04.541]  That isn't much of a question.
[02:08:05.121 --> 02:08:06.523]  That is a phrase.
[02:08:07.924 --> 02:08:11.788]  I guess if I could ask you a question, I guess it is really, what's the next step?
[02:08:12.609 --> 02:08:23.199]  Well, the next step right now, we're getting a lot of pressure from all across the United States to kick this thing back up to 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and keep it there.
[02:08:24.787 --> 02:08:26.889]  Are you going to be able to find volunteers to do that?
[02:08:26.929 --> 02:08:29.232]  Well, that's kind of your job right there, man.
[02:08:29.292 --> 02:08:30.173]  And we need the help.
[02:08:30.233 --> 02:08:31.514]  We need to get people in here.
[02:08:31.534 --> 02:08:35.238]  Well, for those that don't know how important this fight is, we'll plug this in a few minutes.
[02:08:35.278 --> 02:08:35.899]  People get ready.
[02:08:36.179 --> 02:08:38.862]  We'll give out the number and emails and places to go.
[02:08:38.882 --> 02:08:41.124]  It was an incredibly successful operation.
[02:08:41.164 --> 02:08:45.029]  But the first big news, Border Patrol told the stand down in Arizona...
[02:08:45.689 --> 02:09:02.761]  Washington Times, Associated Press, you name it, they were ordered because you guys had stacked them up by the tens of thousands with the Mexican army on the other side, and as soon as you guys were forced to leave after a month, they poured across at record levels, and they were ordered to not arrest a lot of people to make it look like you hadn't stopped anybody.
[02:09:03.042 --> 02:09:04.643]  Tell us about your response to this.
[02:09:05.416 --> 02:09:21.558]  Well, the reality is the last 15 days I've had people out on the border not as much looking for illegals but trying to count the number and frequency of border patrols that are available on the different lines that we held over a month in April.
[02:09:22.037 --> 02:09:25.878]  And the reality is, is it went for a long time there during the month of April.
[02:09:26.238 --> 02:09:33.219]  We were seeing one border patrol every seven minutes, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, cross in front of one of our places there.
[02:09:33.639 --> 02:09:36.120]  That way, when the press was there, they'd see all the border patrol.
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:36.980]  Exactly.
[02:09:37.540 --> 02:09:40.401]  Right now, it is down to the daytime hours.
[02:09:40.901 --> 02:09:43.201]  The average is one hour and 42 minutes.
[02:09:44.282 --> 02:09:48.122]  And the nighttime, it is somewhere around four hours.
[02:09:48.682 --> 02:09:51.183]  We had one man out there that had five
[02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:55.833]  And now, there was a machine gun attack on Border Patrol in Texas this morning.
[02:09:55.913 --> 02:09:56.193]  Really?
[02:09:56.213 --> 02:09:57.454]  I hadn't pulled that off yet.
[02:09:57.474 --> 02:09:57.674]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:18.177 --> 02:10:18.617]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:18.657 --> 02:10:20.579]  Well, that just shows what is happening.
[02:10:20.879 --> 02:10:23.601]  And, of course, we're threatened that they're going to shoot us up.
[02:10:23.981 --> 02:10:29.205]  Well, the Border Patrol president said on this show, and others have said, that they've been ordered not to shoot back, Gray Deacon.
[02:10:29.525 --> 02:10:30.546]  That's exactly right.
[02:10:30.626 --> 02:10:40.133]  In fact, what they're trying to do is guarantee the smugglers and the criminals that are coming across this border absolute free access to America.
[02:10:40.213 --> 02:10:46.458]  And, Aaron Zellman, I mean, what do you call that when men, these Border Patrol are told, you let them shoot at you, Mexican troops?
[02:10:48.846 --> 02:10:50.988]  You know, let me tell you something.
[02:10:51.048 --> 02:10:53.269]  I just had this thought as I'm listening to all this.
[02:10:53.970 --> 02:10:59.454]  The Arizona border, that's the border where a great deal of drug smuggling goes on.
[02:10:59.614 --> 02:11:01.035]  And human traffic in space.
[02:11:01.055 --> 02:11:01.916]  And human traffic.
[02:11:01.956 --> 02:11:06.820]  And I'm just beginning to wonder out loud, who's pulling the strings here?
[02:11:08.321 --> 02:11:11.943]  You know, who's profiting by letting this go on?
[02:11:13.144 --> 02:11:17.948]  I keep getting asked that question over and over and over, and I cannot imagine an American...
[02:11:20.785 --> 02:11:24.767]  There's 20 tons of drugs come across this border every night.
[02:11:24.807 --> 02:11:35.535]  Well, Gray Deacon, I've interviewed the former head of the DEA in Latin America, high-level CIA officers who were there at the planes being unloaded with cocaine at MENA and other places, and there's Oliver North.
[02:11:36.215 --> 02:11:36.355]  Yep.
[02:11:36.716 --> 02:11:44.141]  And who is ever going to stand up finally and say, there are members of our own government who are profiting directly from
[02:11:44.508 --> 02:11:50.609]  From the smuggling of human beings, drugs, and weapons, and perhaps even weapons of mass destruction.
[02:11:51.049 --> 02:11:53.990]  Because that's the only reason they would be protecting this operation.
[02:11:54.010 --> 02:12:01.432]  Well, Glenn Spencer did a thing last year where they marched through with a backpack marked nuclear device right up to the federal courthouse.
[02:12:01.952 --> 02:12:02.112]  Yep.
[02:12:02.672 --> 02:12:03.612]  These people are idiots.
[02:12:03.652 --> 02:12:07.933]  And then the guards didn't even know that it said nuclear device and just told them, turn your cameras off.
[02:12:08.373 --> 02:12:08.533]  Yep.
[02:12:09.193 --> 02:12:09.333]  Yep.
[02:12:09.613 --> 02:12:10.193]  Aaron Zellman?
[02:12:10.734 --> 02:12:11.994]  Yeah, I was just going to suggest...
[02:12:14.457 --> 02:12:25.442]  Maybe the two of you would like to take the conversation we've had for the last couple of minutes here about who's profiting and challenge folks in the government to prove you wrong.
[02:12:27.382 --> 02:12:32.004]  Go more public with this and ask these folks to prove you wrong.
[02:12:32.524 --> 02:12:36.786]  I think that you're going to get the same kind of dancing routine you got from the congressman.
[02:12:38.154 --> 02:12:41.379]  Well, I think you're going to get a tremendous amount of dancing going on.
[02:12:41.419 --> 02:12:51.134]  And right now, today, right in the face of everything else that's going on, we have United States senators that are actually proposing two new amnesty programs.
[02:12:51.744 --> 02:12:53.966]  Two brand new amnesty programs.
[02:12:54.707 --> 02:13:13.003]  Before we call for volunteers, before we get into that, Gray Deacon, give us the websites, give us the contact info, and then I want to get into your leader of the Minutemen, Civil Homeland Defense, trying to go to a public press conference, but Homeland Security said, no, you can't come in and talk about how we've ordered a stand down.
[02:13:13.283 --> 02:13:16.566]  Because Hayworth, the congressman, was outraged by that in the last hour.
[02:13:17.026 --> 02:13:18.207]  Yes, I'm sure he was.
[02:13:18.667 --> 02:13:26.674]  Okay, hey, you can get a hold of us at, the phone number is 520-457-2320.
[02:13:28.356 --> 02:13:33.700]  You can get us on the web at minutemannhq.com.
[02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:35.442]  minutemannhq.com.
[02:13:35.482 --> 02:13:36.743]  Give that number out again twice.
[02:13:37.123 --> 02:13:37.623]  That is 520-457-2320.
[02:13:37.643 --> 02:13:37.663]  520-
[02:13:45.077 --> 02:13:46.480]  And write it down, minutemanhq.com.
[02:13:51.663 --> 02:13:55.587]  Now, let's get into the leader of the amendment, the founder.
[02:13:56.007 --> 02:13:57.909]  Not even allowed into these public press conferences.
[02:13:57.949 --> 02:13:58.789]  He might be Al Qaeda.
[02:13:58.829 --> 02:13:59.470]  Tell us all about it.
[02:13:59.870 --> 02:14:03.613]  Well, Chris Simcox is the leader that you're talking about.
[02:14:03.633 --> 02:14:09.558]  He also happens to be the owner and editor and one of the reporters for the Tombstone Tumbleweed.
[02:14:10.239 --> 02:14:14.983]  And he got an invitation to go to the press conference.
[02:14:15.529 --> 02:14:18.411]  That everybody else got the invitation, all the press.
[02:14:18.431 --> 02:14:26.737]  But then Homeland Security tells Congress, no, you can't have your guest in who is accredited press and the leader of a movement, because security!
[02:14:27.317 --> 02:14:27.757]  That's right.
[02:14:28.037 --> 02:14:30.879]  Well, they still haven't told us why he wasn't allowed in.
[02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:32.300]  Hayworth said security.
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:37.063]  Well, that's what they're... They then told the representative, because we keep calling... That's what he said.
[02:14:38.024 --> 02:14:43.908]  And we keep asking, why... I mean, Aaron, this is a Nazi, Soviet-style tactic if I've ever seen one, Aaron.
[02:14:44.548 --> 02:14:45.209]  Well, that it is.
[02:14:46.275 --> 02:14:53.558]  I'm not sure how we're going to get that message out to millions of people, but I'd start beating that drum as hard as you can, Alex.
[02:14:54.279 --> 02:15:03.503]  Well, I mean, are we going to... I mean, folks, what is Homeland Security doing telling the Congress what to do?
[02:15:05.084 --> 02:15:06.904]  They've been trying to do that now for three years.
[02:15:06.924 --> 02:15:10.486]  You know, they're real good at taking away big gliders in the airport, though.
[02:15:11.297 --> 02:15:15.118]  And they can get your mail file, and if you argue with them, they're going to give you a full body search.
[02:15:15.499 --> 02:15:16.279]  And charge you.
[02:15:16.359 --> 02:15:25.522]  But if you want to call the Border Patrol when you see a truckload of drugs being unloaded by men in black masks, Bush gets up and calls you dangerous vigilantes.
[02:15:26.163 --> 02:15:29.924]  Here's a good suggestion for everybody in your listening audience.
[02:15:30.264 --> 02:15:40.128]  Go to your local phone book and try to find out how you would call Border Patrol, ICE, ICE is, by the way, the Immigration Customs Enforcement Agency,
[02:15:40.885 --> 02:15:42.427]  The new acronym for them.
[02:15:43.309 --> 02:15:52.002]  Or Homeland Security, if you want to report a problem, then try to get on those phone lines and call and say, I just want to make sure I can report
[02:15:52.625 --> 02:16:00.109]  You know, an illegal alien, explosive devices coming across the border, anything, and find out if you can even get through.
[02:16:00.149 --> 02:16:04.091]  Most people cannot even find the number in their local phone book.
[02:16:04.151 --> 02:16:07.132]  It's meant to terrorize and create fear.
[02:16:07.152 --> 02:16:07.613]  Yes.
[02:16:08.093 --> 02:16:14.076]  Aaron Zellman, I mean, for anybody that didn't get it yet, really, I've seen this open borders issue.
[02:16:14.136 --> 02:16:15.296]  That's the key now.
[02:16:15.737 --> 02:16:17.638]  So many people are waking up, Aaron.
[02:16:18.538 --> 02:16:19.218]  Well, we hope so.
[02:16:21.495 --> 02:16:24.837]  Even Schwarzenegger, I guess, prays with the amendment we're doing.
[02:16:24.957 --> 02:16:25.918]  But then retracted it.
[02:16:25.938 --> 02:16:27.398]  He's just trying to get his poll numbers up.
[02:16:27.518 --> 02:16:27.979]  No, no, no.
[02:16:28.039 --> 02:16:31.721]  He came back and he again said that he supports what we do.
[02:16:31.741 --> 02:16:34.562]  But he also supports Bush's amnesty plan.
[02:16:34.702 --> 02:16:35.483]  Well, yeah.
[02:16:36.363 --> 02:16:37.944]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[02:16:37.984 --> 02:16:45.748]  Right now the entire GOP is in absolute disarray and confusion, and the Democrats don't even know what to do about it.
[02:16:47.832 --> 02:16:50.614]  No, but there is no Department of Homeland Security.
[02:16:50.734 --> 02:16:55.157]  Anybody that believes there is such a thing, just come down here on the border any given night.
[02:16:55.177 --> 02:17:06.166]  No, it's only there to terrorize us so they can then point our military at some new country to grab oil, and we have their own documents showing that, creating terrorists that didn't exist in the first place.
[02:17:06.646 --> 02:17:07.107]  Exactly.
[02:17:08.168 --> 02:17:14.973]  You know, at some point the American public is going to have to stand up and say, look, Bush administration...
[02:17:16.707 --> 02:17:22.613]  I do a lot of talking about homeland security, but so far you haven't secured one single inch of the border.
[02:17:23.514 --> 02:17:27.739]  Well, for the record, headline, Border Patrol told to stand down in Arizona.
[02:17:28.159 --> 02:17:30.041]  Stand down, accept gunfire.
[02:17:30.061 --> 02:17:32.764]  Do what you're told, slaves.
[02:17:33.045 --> 02:17:38.611]  Aaron Zellman, Ray Deacon, both of you gentlemen, stay there as we continue on the front lines of the Infowars.
[02:17:40.160 --> 02:17:43.522]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:17:43.762 --> 02:17:44.102]  Why?
[02:17:44.443 --> 02:17:47.064]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[02:22:04.914 --> 02:22:06.435]  And coming up, we will get to all the callers.
[02:22:06.455 --> 02:22:14.222]  I've been holding forever, but I've just had, again, a squadron of guests on today as we try to unravel all this Byzantine propaganda.
[02:22:14.623 --> 02:22:21.629]  But to Aaron Zellman, if people want to join a real Second Amendment organization or sign up for your free alerts or get involved, how do they do that?
[02:22:22.521 --> 02:22:36.011]  Well, they can contact us at 800-869-1884, or they can go to the website, which is jpfo.org, and I would encourage them to sign up for our free alerts, and they can run the website.
[02:22:36.031 --> 02:22:40.374]  They're free to download all the information we have, and we've got tons of it.
[02:22:40.994 --> 02:22:47.539]  And I would also encourage them to go to our special project site, which is rebelfire.com.
[02:22:48.354 --> 02:22:48.694]  Rock.
[02:22:48.814 --> 02:22:50.615]  That's R-E-B-E-L-F-I-R-O-C-K.
[02:22:50.635 --> 02:22:51.896]  RebelFireRock.com.
[02:22:51.916 --> 02:22:54.037]  Yeah, RebelFireRock.com.
[02:22:54.837 --> 02:22:55.557]  Do me a favor.
[02:22:55.717 --> 02:22:56.458]  Put a plug in.
[02:22:56.498 --> 02:23:00.059]  If they want to help kids, go there and listen to this and give the information to kids.
[02:23:00.079 --> 02:23:02.440]  Well, we're going to play that song when we have time again later.
[02:23:02.560 --> 02:23:03.941]  It's a great new song.
[02:23:04.815 --> 02:23:15.362]  Put in a plug, because I carry your Innocence Betrayed video, high-grade, professionally produced, I mean, we're talking broadcast TV quality, and then three-color comic books come with that.
[02:23:15.482 --> 02:23:16.162]  I carry that.
[02:23:17.243 --> 02:23:18.103]  Plug that for us.
[02:23:19.424 --> 02:23:32.152]  Well, yeah, the Innocence Betrayed approach is there to help destroy the myth that there's anything useful or good or civilized about gun control, and it's been very effective.
[02:23:33.428 --> 02:23:42.284]  We have some comments on our website from people around the world who have used the film to destroy the myth that gun control is useful.
[02:23:42.842 --> 02:23:50.028]  Well, we've got it available for the same price you guys have got it, right there at InfoWars.com, the secure, safe, online shopping cart.
[02:23:50.088 --> 02:23:58.695]  And I hope people will get it and show it to the VFW, show it to your college students, because every time they take the guns, they always murder.
[02:23:59.015 --> 02:24:01.017]  I mean, it always happens.
[02:24:01.457 --> 02:24:06.942]  Well, you know, the history of gun control is directly linked to the history of death by government.
[02:24:07.754 --> 02:24:11.275]  Which is one of the number one causes of death that isn't cancer or heart attack related.
[02:24:11.855 --> 02:24:15.376]  No, murdering people is the main cause of death.
[02:24:16.256 --> 02:24:18.737]  And governments are very good at it.
[02:24:19.357 --> 02:24:19.737]  They are.
[02:24:19.757 --> 02:24:22.058]  Aaron Zellman, I want to thank you for coming on with us.
[02:24:22.218 --> 02:24:22.838]  My pleasure.
[02:24:23.158 --> 02:24:23.698]  Take care, Mike.
[02:24:23.718 --> 02:24:24.398]  You guys do well.
[02:24:24.638 --> 02:24:25.339]  Valken Dios.
[02:24:25.699 --> 02:24:26.319]  Go with God.
[02:24:27.319 --> 02:24:32.981]  Going back to Gray Deacon, Gray, it boggles the mind.
[02:24:33.361 --> 02:24:34.501]  It makes my head spin.
[02:24:35.146 --> 02:24:38.527]  I mean, here's KRGV-TV.
[02:24:39.127 --> 02:24:41.928]  Border Patrol takes fire from across the border.
[02:24:41.968 --> 02:24:44.929]  They were stopping some drug smugglers that were on the U.S.
[02:24:44.949 --> 02:24:46.410]  side with a truck full of narcotics.
[02:24:46.830 --> 02:24:51.111]  And so they got open... The smugglers opened fire.
[02:24:51.151 --> 02:25:00.834]  We've had Mexican troops kill Border Patrol, kill Forestry Service agents, Mexican drug gangs killing people, bounties on edge, MS-13 threatening to kill you guys.
[02:25:01.494 --> 02:25:04.015]  But Bush says we're evil if we even report these people.
[02:25:05.140 --> 02:25:08.803]  Yeah, and I imagine that that means that he's in favor of what's going on.
[02:25:08.843 --> 02:25:10.064]  That's the only way you can do it.
[02:25:10.144 --> 02:25:12.285]  I mean, that's the only way you can cut that monster.
[02:25:12.305 --> 02:25:13.807]  They're a well-known drug-dealing family.
[02:25:14.667 --> 02:25:23.113]  And, you know, either he's in favor of what's going on, or he would be doing something to protect American citizens and American lives.
[02:25:23.434 --> 02:25:27.136]  They're building a border completely around all the passable areas.
[02:25:27.176 --> 02:25:28.417]  That's half of Afghanistan.
[02:25:28.457 --> 02:25:28.878]  The rest is...
[02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:32.602]  5,000, 10,000 foot mountains, depending on where you're at.
[02:25:32.883 --> 02:25:37.286]  A complete fence around the entire country, double fence with guard shacks every two miles.
[02:25:37.907 --> 02:25:39.688]  But we can't have that here, can we?
[02:25:40.128 --> 02:25:43.271]  No, and nobody in the administration has been able to answer why not.
[02:25:43.611 --> 02:25:48.235]  And now they're building, what is it, they're saying 900 miles of fence in Iraq.
[02:25:48.975 --> 02:25:49.355]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:49.876 --> 02:25:56.541]  But we can't have the same kind of fencing here on our border where we have a known hostile government on the other side.
[02:25:57.324 --> 02:25:59.085]  That says this belongs to Mexico.
[02:25:59.345 --> 02:26:02.687]  That says that the whole Southwest belongs to Mexico.
[02:26:03.227 --> 02:26:05.249]  Openly, this president and the last president.
[02:26:05.489 --> 02:26:06.009]  That's correct.
[02:26:07.250 --> 02:26:12.333]  And, you know, here's our government saying, oh, yes, I think what we'll do is make it a little bit easier for you.
[02:26:12.373 --> 02:26:13.893]  Here's another amnesty program.
[02:26:13.913 --> 02:26:15.995]  These lorries conquista groups, we've been there.
[02:26:16.015 --> 02:26:16.555]  We have video.
[02:26:17.463 --> 02:26:20.805]  You go to these Fourth of July rallies, they will not allow that in L.A.
[02:26:20.865 --> 02:26:23.747]  I mean, peaceful rallies, blacks, Hispanics, whites together.
[02:26:24.068 --> 02:26:26.549]  The group runs up with rocks, starts busting their heads open.
[02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:29.351]  The federal agents at the courthouse are told not to help.
[02:26:29.391 --> 02:26:30.112]  This has been in the news.
[02:26:30.572 --> 02:26:34.575]  And they have huge banners with images of blonde-haired, blue-eyed people's heads cut off.
[02:26:35.376 --> 02:26:36.356]  Have you ever seen that video?
[02:26:37.097 --> 02:26:37.637]  Yes, I have.
[02:26:38.097 --> 02:26:38.938]  Folks, we're not kidding.
[02:26:39.238 --> 02:26:44.482]  Imagine if the Klan was marching by the thousands with pictures of black people's heads cut off.
[02:26:45.208 --> 02:26:47.229]  But it's never on the news, is it, my friend?
[02:26:47.469 --> 02:26:54.751]  No, it isn't, and perhaps that's the reason that one of the leaders of La Raza is now your Attorney General for the United States of America.
[02:26:54.771 --> 02:26:57.913]  Well, forget La Raza.
[02:26:57.973 --> 02:26:58.993]  He was a METCHA member.
[02:26:59.413 --> 02:27:01.034]  Yes, he was a METCHA member also.
[02:27:01.354 --> 02:27:05.595]  Whose motto is, everything for the race, for others nothing.
[02:27:05.956 --> 02:27:06.536]  That's correct.
[02:27:06.956 --> 02:27:08.576]  Ein Volk, ein Reich, ein Führer!
[02:27:10.855 --> 02:27:12.155]  Sieg Heil!
[02:27:12.675 --> 02:27:14.076]  Sieg Heil!
[02:27:14.476 --> 02:27:15.836]  Sieg Heil!
[02:27:16.196 --> 02:27:17.536]  Sieg Heil!
[02:27:17.616 --> 02:27:19.937]  But it's okay, because it's part of the balkanization.
[02:27:20.297 --> 02:27:21.157]  Gray Deacon, stay there.
[02:27:21.177 --> 02:27:28.838]  We're going to blitz through calls and news on the other side as we talk to the spokesman for the Minutemen, banned by Homeland Security from press conferences.
[02:27:30.519 --> 02:27:31.439]  We're on the march.
[02:27:31.919 --> 02:27:33.519]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:34.439 --> 02:27:37.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:42.586 --> 02:27:48.067]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:27:48.487 --> 02:27:52.728]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:27:52.948 --> 02:27:59.990]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:28:00.370 --> 02:28:06.492]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:28:06.612 --> 02:28:07.832]  There are no side effects.
[02:28:08.032 --> 02:28:08.493]  We're good to go.
[02:28:24.955 --> 02:28:28.039]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:28:28.059 --> 02:28:28.099]  866-885-6625.
[02:28:28.119 --> 02:28:28.339]  866-885-6625.
[02:28:28.459 --> 02:28:29.400]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:29.620]  Call today.
[02:28:40.063 --> 02:28:46.310]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:46.450 --> 02:28:52.616]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:52.876 --> 02:29:01.265]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:01.565 --> 02:29:08.612]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:08.893 --> 02:29:13.738]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:13.938 --> 02:29:19.343]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:19.684 --> 02:29:22.727]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:23.087 --> 02:29:30.993]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:31.093 --> 02:29:31.654]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:39.588 --> 02:29:41.269]  Soon, the mark of the beast will be enforced.
[02:29:41.469 --> 02:29:43.490]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.
[02:29:43.690 --> 02:29:44.370]  Prepare yourself.
[02:29:44.550 --> 02:29:48.231]  Find out who the beast is and how to avoid his mark with this free book offer.
[02:29:48.391 --> 02:29:54.133]  Call toll-free 888-211-1715 and receive the book The Bible Says for free.
[02:29:54.173 --> 02:29:55.574]  There is absolutely no obligation.
[02:29:55.734 --> 02:29:58.355]  No one will call you and your number will not be sold to telemarketers.
[02:29:58.475 --> 02:30:00.056]  We just want to make sure you know the truth.
[02:30:00.296 --> 02:30:03.137]  Get your free book, The Bible Says, by calling toll-free 888-211-1715.
[02:30:03.197 --> 02:30:03.937]  Again, that's 888-211-1715.
[02:30:09.219 --> 02:30:12.800]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:16.921]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[02:30:17.061 --> 02:30:20.562]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[02:30:20.942 --> 02:30:28.524]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[02:30:28.804 --> 02:30:32.084]  Keep it clean, and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[02:30:32.505 --> 02:30:36.145]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[02:30:36.405 --> 02:30:38.226]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:30:57.384 --> 02:31:00.867]  All right, we're about to go back to Gray Deacon, spokesman for the Minutemen Project.
[02:31:01.988 --> 02:31:13.077]  And I promise, we're going right to Bob and Lynn and Lou and Jim and everybody else that's patiently holding.
[02:31:13.097 --> 02:31:17.901]  I didn't give you the number to get that video that Aaron Zellman and JPFO produced.
[02:31:18.881 --> 02:31:20.723]  And it comes with three free coloring books.
[02:31:20.883 --> 02:31:22.184]  Not coloring books, I keep saying that.
[02:31:22.264 --> 02:31:23.045]  Comic books.
[02:31:24.428 --> 02:31:29.992]  You know, that show the history of gun control, and it's really effective for these brain-dead adults out there.
[02:31:32.034 --> 02:31:32.634]  You need to get it.
[02:31:32.694 --> 02:31:33.755]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[02:31:33.815 --> 02:31:36.917]  You can watch the trailer there as well, or call toll-free.
[02:31:36.957 --> 02:31:41.200]  You can get my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State, my most powerful film ever, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:31:46.641 --> 02:31:50.904]  And I got a bunch of discounts on some of my other films, as low as $5.95 apiece.
[02:31:50.924 --> 02:32:06.056]  So ask about those when you call 1-888-253-3139, or order the hard copies of the films and books and other materials, books on tape I carry, at InfoWars.com via the Safe Secure Shopping Cart, or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100,
[02:32:11.147 --> 02:32:12.288]  Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:32:13.489 --> 02:32:14.129]  Do not wait.
[02:32:14.169 --> 02:32:16.211]  That number, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:32:16.231 --> 02:32:21.495]  And my last plug of the day is this, before we go back to our guests and your calls.
[02:32:23.576 --> 02:32:26.098]  Coming up, Friday, June 3rd.
[02:32:26.278 --> 02:32:37.046]  Friday, June 3rd, 7 and 10 p.m., two separate showings of Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State at the Alamo Draft House Cinema and the restaurant.
[02:32:37.066 --> 02:32:38.187]  You can eat right there at your table.
[02:32:39.210 --> 02:32:41.815]  In downtown Austin on Colorado Street, plenty of parking.
[02:32:41.835 --> 02:32:43.458]  There's a big parking garage right next to it.
[02:32:44.600 --> 02:32:46.304]  Cost you a few shekels, but c'est la vie.
[02:32:47.627 --> 02:32:50.369]  It's going to be a great event, and I want to see everybody out there.
[02:32:50.849 --> 02:32:52.030]  People are asking which event's better.
[02:32:52.050 --> 02:32:53.651]  7, 10, doesn't matter.
[02:32:53.671 --> 02:32:57.874]  I'll give a short speech, play the film, take a 20, 30-minute question and answer after each.
[02:32:58.394 --> 02:33:05.358]  So if you're already going out Friday night, taking your wife or girlfriend out or taking your husband out or whatever, or out with family, go eat dinner with 7 o'clock.
[02:33:05.899 --> 02:33:08.340]  And after dinner, 9 o'clock, 9.30, get there.
[02:33:09.201 --> 02:33:10.381]  Get in for the second showing.
[02:33:10.421 --> 02:33:11.222]  Watch the late night.
[02:33:11.262 --> 02:33:16.305]  Or if you want to get to bed early, want to bring the kids out for a family event, come to the 7 o'clock event.
[02:33:17.847 --> 02:33:21.932]  So that's Friday, June 3rd, coming up here in about 20 days.
[02:33:22.913 --> 02:33:23.955]  Precisely 20 days.
[02:33:24.976 --> 02:33:30.684]  And then on top of that, the next week we're going to have a single showing, Wednesday the 8th.
[02:33:31.405 --> 02:33:32.386]  Wednesday the 8th!
[02:33:34.022 --> 02:33:37.183]  At 8 o'clock at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar.
[02:33:37.643 --> 02:33:39.423]  You can buy tickets to all of that online.
[02:33:39.443 --> 02:33:40.604]  Just go to InfoWars.com.
[02:33:40.624 --> 02:33:41.304]  There's a big banner.
[02:33:41.664 --> 02:33:44.065]  See Alex Jones and Marshall Law in person.
[02:33:44.365 --> 02:33:54.968]  Click on it, and there's links to each showing, and you go to the Alamo Draft House secure ticket service, and you can pick which showtime, directions, maps, everything you need.
[02:33:55.608 --> 02:33:57.088]  So InfoWars.com.
[02:33:57.128 --> 02:33:57.688]  And don't wait.
[02:33:58.308 --> 02:34:00.349]  I checked how many tickets have been sold yesterday.
[02:34:01.152 --> 02:34:03.353]  Morning, it was 20% of the tickets.
[02:34:03.713 --> 02:34:05.494]  And they were amazed at the Alamo Draft House.
[02:34:05.514 --> 02:34:06.215]  They know it's sold out.
[02:34:06.235 --> 02:34:11.897]  The other times they've shown it, but they were like, man, even Star Wars, two or three weeks out, hadn't sold 20%.
[02:34:13.118 --> 02:34:14.499]  And now it's basically sold out.
[02:34:14.559 --> 02:34:15.759]  It's coming out next Wednesday.
[02:34:16.220 --> 02:34:20.242]  So, I mean, just to give you an idea, locally, you'd be smart to get your tickets.
[02:34:20.442 --> 02:34:24.324]  And we'll tell you if anything sells out beforehand so you can go to one of the shows that didn't sell out.
[02:34:24.844 --> 02:34:26.665]  But it could sell out, so be careful.
[02:34:27.865 --> 02:34:30.367]  Let's go back to our guest, Gray Deacon.
[02:34:30.407 --> 02:34:30.707]  Gray?
[02:34:31.368 --> 02:34:32.668]  There's so many facets to this.
[02:34:32.708 --> 02:34:56.435]  Again, for those who just joined us, Border Patrol ordered to stand down after you guys stood down because they didn't want to show that the flood of those that have been held up by your dam, your human dam you had built there in your lawn chairs reporting to the Border Patrol, and that key number you gave us before your people were reporting during your security that you ran for a month on that 23-mile stretch of the border, you reported to our listeners.
[02:34:57.961 --> 02:35:03.283]  That you, your people, every seven minutes were logging Border Patrol.
[02:35:03.323 --> 02:35:05.343]  Now you said every hour and 45 minutes?
[02:35:05.363 --> 02:35:06.064]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:06.944 --> 02:35:09.185]  I mean, that's like 15 times less frequency.
[02:35:09.245 --> 02:35:13.846]  And then we have their own agents, 12 of them, saying they were ordered not to stop illegals.
[02:35:14.166 --> 02:35:15.106]  That is a felony!
[02:35:15.627 --> 02:35:15.827]  Yes.
[02:35:16.447 --> 02:35:16.607]  Yes.
[02:35:17.307 --> 02:35:22.409]  And now we have Mr. Bonner, who is actually, he is the U.S.
[02:35:22.489 --> 02:35:24.529]  Customs and Border Protection Commissioner.
[02:35:24.589 --> 02:35:26.270]  He's the top dog in that whole heap.
[02:35:27.737 --> 02:35:29.738]  Here's what he actually told Congress yesterday.
[02:35:30.458 --> 02:35:38.021]  We hope to gain operational control of the border, meaning there is a high level of probability you will get caught trying to sneak into the United States.
[02:35:38.541 --> 02:35:41.683]  I'm not saying that we have the border under control, because we don't.
[02:35:42.103 --> 02:35:43.323]  We have a long ways to go.
[02:35:43.343 --> 02:35:52.807]  This man admits that they can't even come close, and what he's calling operational control is you'll have a high probability of being caught.
[02:35:53.504 --> 02:35:54.945]  Not a certain probability.
[02:35:55.005 --> 02:35:57.325]  Not even that you are going to get caught.
[02:35:57.485 --> 02:35:58.686]  Look, this is what they need to do.
[02:35:59.706 --> 02:36:06.829]  They need to let the state police and the feds, the Border Patrol, have access to those surveillance blimps.
[02:36:08.029 --> 02:36:12.170]  Already on the Texas border, they've got a couple of these blimps, but it's only for looking for drugs.
[02:36:12.551 --> 02:36:14.011]  And I've talked to people that operate them.
[02:36:14.331 --> 02:36:15.251]  There's nobody in the blimps.
[02:36:15.271 --> 02:36:16.552]  They're tethered with cameras.
[02:36:17.813 --> 02:36:21.082]  And they will see a drug shipment and they're told, leave that one alone, stop this one.
[02:36:21.563 --> 02:36:25.073]  They literally have licensed... This is documented.
[02:36:25.891 --> 02:36:27.732]  We need to have those dirigibles on there.
[02:36:27.792 --> 02:36:30.014]  We need to have cameras put up.
[02:36:30.034 --> 02:36:31.515]  It would be very inexpensive.
[02:36:32.235 --> 02:36:39.860]  We have a blimp out here, and it's very, very effective, but it's only allowed to use certain types of equipment.
[02:36:39.900 --> 02:36:41.021]  The equipment to do everything.
[02:36:41.081 --> 02:36:44.083]  I mean, to count the number of ants down here is on board.
[02:36:44.343 --> 02:36:51.348]  Well, they've got the infrared and the ground-penetrating radar, and they can look at a pickup truck five miles away and look right through it.
[02:36:51.648 --> 02:36:55.751]  That's right, but they refuse to use... They have equipment, folks, where everything is glass.
[02:36:56.251 --> 02:36:58.072]  It's like Wonder Woman's jet airplane.
[02:36:58.092 --> 02:36:58.972]  You know, you can see through it.
[02:36:58.992 --> 02:36:59.472]  Yes.
[02:37:00.173 --> 02:37:01.273]  But they refuse to use it.
[02:37:02.173 --> 02:37:05.815]  Because they might interrupt the interstate commerce.
[02:37:06.555 --> 02:37:09.116]  Is that a mobile blimp or a tethered army blimp?
[02:37:09.356 --> 02:37:10.277]  Tethered army blimp.
[02:37:10.337 --> 02:37:11.657]  It sits right over the top of the boardwalk.
[02:37:11.677 --> 02:37:15.199]  We need at least a hundred of those suckers down there right now, and they've got them in mothballs.
[02:37:15.399 --> 02:37:15.999]  Yes, they do.
[02:37:16.559 --> 02:37:17.740]  And all they need to do is put them up.
[02:37:18.560 --> 02:37:19.880]  What are there right now on the border?
[02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:21.301]  Are there eight or ten blimps?
[02:37:22.529 --> 02:37:26.790]  Well, I think there's ten across the entire United States, including one up in the Canada area.
[02:37:26.850 --> 02:37:28.130]  Those blimps are so cheap.
[02:37:28.390 --> 02:37:30.471]  Oh, no, we're going to have a blimp over Dallas and D.C.
[02:37:30.531 --> 02:37:33.171]  and New York and Houston and Chicago and L.A.
[02:37:33.611 --> 02:37:34.792]  Don't throw our walls.
[02:37:35.352 --> 02:37:35.532]  Sure.
[02:37:37.252 --> 02:37:37.372]  Yep.
[02:37:38.112 --> 02:37:38.592]  Unbelievable.
[02:37:38.612 --> 02:37:44.434]  You tell the average idiot that, Gray Deacon, and they go, there's not that thing that sticks to my walls.
[02:37:44.454 --> 02:37:45.294]  Mm-hmm.
[02:37:46.997 --> 02:37:48.198]  You can see through the walls.
[02:37:48.238 --> 02:37:51.180]  You can see... I mean, they can do everything they want to.
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:56.144]  The thing is, is they say that that technology is only to be used in warfare.
[02:37:56.204 --> 02:37:58.366]  It isn't to be used in control of our borders.
[02:37:58.586 --> 02:38:03.630]  But for five years they've been giving it to police departments very quietly.
[02:38:03.950 --> 02:38:04.171]  Right.
[02:38:04.471 --> 02:38:05.972]  I'm talking about in the red, folks.
[02:38:06.712 --> 02:38:06.893]  Yeah.
[02:38:07.553 --> 02:38:08.354]  But here's the deal.
[02:38:08.434 --> 02:38:16.180]  Traditionally, we've been able to... Every country in the world thinks that the first means of defense of their nation is to control their borders.
[02:38:17.128 --> 02:38:21.869]  And all of a sudden our government now is saying, no, that's not the business of the United States government.
[02:38:21.889 --> 02:38:25.110]  But give all your rights up because Al Qaeda is about to attack you any minute.
[02:38:25.410 --> 02:38:25.610]  Right.
[02:38:26.391 --> 02:38:36.773]  Now the other thing is, President Bush, the day before yesterday, went out and made a big speech about the rights of Georgia, the country of Georgia, over there, and next to what used to be part of Russia.
[02:38:36.813 --> 02:38:37.714]  To secede from Russia.
[02:38:37.974 --> 02:38:38.214]  Right.
[02:38:38.794 --> 02:38:46.316]  And the right of them to control their borders and how all nations have to respect the borders and the sovereignty of Georgia.
[02:38:47.290 --> 02:38:57.719]  Now, there's something really wrong when he demands that a little bitty town trying to secede from Russia has more rights than the entire United States of America has.
[02:38:57.899 --> 02:39:03.543]  We do not have the right to say to our neighbors to the south, respect our borders.
[02:39:03.683 --> 02:39:05.445]  Now he wants to get free health care and all the illegals.
[02:39:05.805 --> 02:39:06.566]  Let's take a pause.
[02:39:07.350 --> 02:39:08.270]  Unbelievable, folks.
[02:39:08.650 --> 02:39:10.191]  Bob in Texas, then the others.
[02:39:10.231 --> 02:39:10.811]  Go ahead, Bob.
[02:39:10.831 --> 02:39:11.331]  Thanks for holding.
[02:39:11.671 --> 02:39:15.672]  Gentlemen, yeah, it's been a while.
[02:39:15.752 --> 02:39:19.952]  The border situation in general is probably more severe than we were even thinking about right now.
[02:39:19.972 --> 02:39:28.374]  You know World War III is about to erupt within 30 days over there in the Middle East, and part of this plan appears to be to keep our borders porous.
[02:39:29.654 --> 02:39:34.655]  It's an analogous to an intravenous line stuck in the underbelly of the United States.
[02:39:35.465 --> 02:39:39.088]  And they're keeping the flow going, and it's almost like a... It's the equivalent of a fire hose.
[02:39:39.388 --> 02:39:48.074]  Yeah, well, it's a slow-motion first wave of attack, and... Well, I don't want to say you're right, but, I mean, we've got the Chinese military, L.A.
[02:39:48.094 --> 02:39:50.656]  Times, shipping in AK-47s for the gangs.
[02:39:50.956 --> 02:39:53.838]  Well, I'm afraid that the Chinese will soon be behind that, too.
[02:39:53.879 --> 02:39:58.682]  They're going to be the second wave that comes through right now, but... That's actually already happening.
[02:39:59.082 --> 02:39:59.663]  Yeah, well...
[02:40:01.209 --> 02:40:09.495]  I'm afraid that they want the borders open because it's going to keep the underbelly of the United States open for the first wave of attack once they get World War III going.
[02:40:09.515 --> 02:40:11.657]  That's what I'm afraid is getting ready to happen.
[02:40:12.998 --> 02:40:16.541]  They sure are arrogant, Gray Deacon, like they know something big is coming.
[02:40:17.197 --> 02:40:25.964]  Well, I don't know what they know as big as coming, but I know that I need volunteers to come out here and sit on this border and to train so that we can expand into other areas and other states.
[02:40:26.464 --> 02:40:32.349]  And that's what I need to do is have people give us a call here at 520-457-2320 in order to get our ranks built up to the point where we can be out there 24-7.
[02:40:36.832 --> 02:40:42.755]  You did a superb job in the month you did it, and now you're talking about launching it in three or four border states and in Vermont, correct?
[02:40:42.955 --> 02:40:43.435]  Yes, sir.
[02:40:43.495 --> 02:40:48.097]  We're actually talking about, well, Maine now has added their name to the list.
[02:40:48.658 --> 02:40:56.021]  It's Maine, Vermont, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Idaho, and Washington.
[02:40:56.041 --> 02:40:57.822]  They've all put their hands in the mix.
[02:40:58.802 --> 02:40:59.082]  Alex?
[02:40:59.482 --> 02:40:59.783]  Yes, sir?
[02:41:00.263 --> 02:41:05.085]  I think that this recent meeting with Bush and Putin over there in Russia...
[02:41:06.239 --> 02:41:12.464]  Supposedly commemorating the end of World War II and the defeat of Nazism was actually a prelude to World War III.
[02:41:13.185 --> 02:41:23.933]  It's just like you used to say, Alex, that the kings and potentates in Europe used to get together and say, look, let's get us a little war going between each other so we can keep our populations under control.
[02:41:25.254 --> 02:41:30.618]  This is a classic example, I think, that's going on right underneath our... I know the meeting with Sharon was a war council.
[02:41:30.658 --> 02:41:33.481]  We said that, and then later it came out that it really was.
[02:41:33.501 --> 02:41:34.241]  I mean, they admitted it.
[02:41:34.261 --> 02:41:35.102]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:36.538 --> 02:41:43.461]  You know, when something else gets blown up, or a city gets nuked, or a smallpox gets released, the media is just going to ignore the fact that our borders are open, aren't they, Greg?
[02:41:44.022 --> 02:41:44.702]  Yes, they will.
[02:41:44.742 --> 02:41:46.523]  Most of the media will totally ignore that.
[02:41:46.863 --> 02:41:54.407]  There are still good media, though, like Jerry Sieper, and he has done an excellent job of following this story and keeping the pressure on.
[02:41:55.427 --> 02:41:57.328]  And he's with Washington Times.
[02:41:58.448 --> 02:41:59.069]  Absolutely.
[02:41:59.569 --> 02:42:00.709]  Who's up next in order here?
[02:42:02.130 --> 02:42:03.551]  Leo in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:42:03.591 --> 02:42:03.871]  Welcome.
[02:42:06.784 --> 02:42:07.044]  Hello?
[02:42:07.264 --> 02:42:07.664]  Yes, sir.
[02:42:07.684 --> 02:42:09.145]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:09.645 --> 02:42:19.529]  I called to relate a few experiences that I had in graduate school and medical school as it relates to the topics you've had today.
[02:42:21.749 --> 02:42:29.172]  You know, in the 90s, there was a huge influx of graduate students from China.
[02:42:30.072 --> 02:42:30.692]  And India.
[02:42:31.293 --> 02:42:34.814]  Well, when I first started, they were mainly Indians, and in fact, they were
[02:42:35.441 --> 02:42:44.628]  They seemed more excited that I was an American than by my high GRE scores and MCAT scores and things like that.
[02:42:46.369 --> 02:42:53.514]  But then the Communist Chinese started coming, and there was one guy in particular who was a really good guy.
[02:42:53.554 --> 02:43:02.880]  He had been at Tiananmen Square, been a leader there, and was quite proud of all that and still had his liberty or death T-shirt and things like that.
[02:43:02.920 --> 02:43:04.321]  But he came over here...
[02:43:05.595 --> 02:43:09.176]  To get out of there before they tracked him down because they had videos and all that of him.
[02:43:09.896 --> 02:43:18.797]  But it was real interesting to talk with the other students from China because, for instance, you mentioned Tibet, and they would just go nuts.
[02:43:20.458 --> 02:43:28.479]  And if you mention, if I brought up Tiananmen Square, they always said, well, the government's just doing what's best for the people.
[02:43:29.039 --> 02:43:31.220]  The government's trying to do what's best for the people.
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:33.440]  So any actions that they...
[02:43:34.384 --> 02:43:41.410]  The government carried out... Well, it looks like Cinnamon Square, when they shot Snellgrove, that girl in the head, or when they ride people down with horses.
[02:43:42.291 --> 02:43:50.838]  Yeah, well, the one who became my friend, he saw people crushed by tanks and things like that.
[02:43:50.858 --> 02:43:52.800]  But I'm saying here they're acting like that towards us.
[02:43:53.200 --> 02:44:01.808]  Well, it's real interesting to hear people that I'd related this to before, and they would talk about how brainwashed the communists are, but they say the exact same thing now.
[02:44:03.375 --> 02:44:05.317]  Oh, our government's just doing what's best for the people.
[02:44:05.757 --> 02:44:10.561]  The Patriot Act is just because the government's looking out for us.
[02:44:11.321 --> 02:44:13.143]  And they have the same mindset.
[02:44:15.144 --> 02:44:20.328]  And then also, in the late 90s, the Russians started coming in.
[02:44:20.829 --> 02:44:23.331]  There were a lot of Russian graduate students.
[02:44:23.351 --> 02:44:24.491]  And real fast, finish up.
[02:44:24.872 --> 02:44:25.312]  Oh, okay.
[02:44:25.372 --> 02:44:31.197]  And there was this postdoc who, when those bombings in the apartments happened, I guess, in 99,
[02:44:32.533 --> 02:44:39.236]  I asked her who was behind that, and she was from Russia, and she said, oh, everyone knows it's the government.
[02:44:40.857 --> 02:44:49.041]  So when 9-11 happened, I was already prepared to be suspicious about the government.
[02:44:49.061 --> 02:44:51.582]  Well, it's now admitted that Russia blows its own buildings up.
[02:44:51.882 --> 02:44:53.743]  I mean, their own FSB has gone public.
[02:44:54.023 --> 02:44:56.365]  They called FSB planning bombs on a fourth building.
[02:44:56.405 --> 02:44:57.985]  Yeah, it's the same M.O.
[02:44:58.045 --> 02:44:58.746]  over and over again.
[02:44:58.766 --> 02:45:01.347]  So when 9-11 happened, what did you think?
[02:45:02.250 --> 02:45:03.971]  Well, terrorism happens over there to the government.
[02:45:06.472 --> 02:45:20.380]  Then with regard to the illegals in medical school, I really got a lot of use out of my college Spanish, especially in obstetrics because they come over when they're
[02:45:21.041 --> 02:45:21.842]  Close to term.
[02:45:22.162 --> 02:45:23.463]  And then they have the child here.
[02:45:23.483 --> 02:45:24.284]  Well, I mean, U.S.
[02:45:24.344 --> 02:45:27.467]  hospitals have even put ads in the paper because they know they get Medicare and Medicaid.
[02:45:27.848 --> 02:45:28.448]  Great points.
[02:45:28.849 --> 02:45:30.710]  Thank you for holding to tell us that.
[02:45:31.071 --> 02:45:32.272]  Comments, Gray Deacon?
[02:45:33.898 --> 02:45:34.939]  Everything he said is true.
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:57.199]  The fact is though that the anchor baby system that is going right now is absolutely insane and as long as these borders are wide open we're going to continue to have new American citizens every day because somebody comes across pregnant and has a baby and immediately the whole family is about shaped into the entire American way of life.
[02:45:57.619 --> 02:45:57.920]  Wow!
[02:45:59.595 --> 02:46:05.457]  But I get to pay $20,000 for having a baby, and they get it for free, and get citizenship.
[02:46:05.817 --> 02:46:06.357]  Exactly.
[02:46:07.337 --> 02:46:14.960]  And remember, LaRozzie insists that all of the people should get free medical if you are not an American citizen.
[02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:20.761]  And they get it, but I have a friend with Crohn's disease who hasn't been able to eat in three weeks, and they won't pay for his surgery.
[02:46:21.101 --> 02:46:21.421]  Oh, no.
[02:46:22.021 --> 02:46:23.682]  No, no, because he's an American.
[02:46:24.762 --> 02:46:25.803]  Folks, we're really not kidding.
[02:46:26.323 --> 02:46:27.363]  I mean, this is not a joke.
[02:46:29.180 --> 02:46:32.542]  Let's talk to Lynn in North Carolina.
[02:46:32.562 --> 02:46:33.122]  Go ahead, Lynn.
[02:46:33.563 --> 02:46:33.843]  Hi.
[02:46:34.523 --> 02:46:38.586]  I've been reading a book called The Silent Invasion by Scott Gilbranson.
[02:46:39.086 --> 02:46:54.615]  He reported in 2003 that border guards were told by custom agents from Washington to just let trucks driven by Mexican military containing Chinese weapons and ammo, fencing material, barbed wire, and bags of lime just go through
[02:46:55.971 --> 02:47:01.015]  I'm a gardener, and I know limes are used in compost piles to hasten the decay of organic matter.
[02:47:01.856 --> 02:47:06.080]  And I remember that the Nazis had used lime in the pits where they threw the dead Jews.
[02:47:06.540 --> 02:47:13.025]  Well, I know they're bringing all kinds of stuff in, and I know that they've dug up hundreds of dead bodies along the Mexico-Texas border.
[02:47:13.146 --> 02:47:17.049]  This is mainstream news down here, where they execute all these people routinely.
[02:47:17.869 --> 02:47:19.511]  And, oh, they don't have a death penalty in Mexico.
[02:47:19.551 --> 02:47:21.913]  They just kill you on the side of the road, Gray Deacon.
[02:47:22.890 --> 02:47:34.417]  You know, one of the things is I spent yesterday with a couple of radio reporters that wanted to blame us for a death that happened inside Mexico below the boot hill of New Mexico.
[02:47:35.157 --> 02:47:44.102]  And I explained, you know, you're talking about almost 200 miles away from where we're operating and in Mexico about 11 miles.
[02:47:44.963 --> 02:47:46.464]  Why are you talking to me about this?
[02:47:46.584 --> 02:47:48.625]  Well, a Mexican smuggler was killed.
[02:47:48.645 --> 02:47:50.386]  I said, yes, in Mexico.
[02:47:51.781 --> 02:47:53.142]  What do you think smugglers do?
[02:47:53.182 --> 02:47:54.923]  There's bandits all over the place.
[02:47:55.704 --> 02:48:00.526]  I said, there's an inter-gang war going on all the time, you know, and it has nothing to do with us.
[02:48:00.646 --> 02:48:03.788]  Do these morons get it?
[02:48:04.188 --> 02:48:04.889]  No, no, no.
[02:48:04.909 --> 02:48:11.713]  He said, well, if you wouldn't have brought this to world attention, then there would not be any killings taking place.
[02:48:12.573 --> 02:48:13.233]  I said, you're nuts.
[02:48:13.794 --> 02:48:14.194]  You're nuts.
[02:48:16.129 --> 02:48:18.111]  Well, they got a job to do, bringing America down.
[02:48:18.151 --> 02:48:19.773]  Who was this scumbag?
[02:48:19.833 --> 02:48:23.736]  Somebody in... I'm not even sure which station it was.
[02:48:23.877 --> 02:48:26.539]  I talked to so many, but this guy just was an idiot.
[02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:29.802]  All right, Lynn, anything else?
[02:48:30.303 --> 02:48:32.565]  Well, I don't think it's just about drug profiteering.
[02:48:32.605 --> 02:48:36.409]  I think they're planning a genocide against us, anybody that won't take the microchip.
[02:48:36.769 --> 02:48:37.490]  Oh, I agree with you.
[02:48:37.530 --> 02:48:38.711]  It's all part of balkanization.
[02:48:40.180 --> 02:48:47.027]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:47.327 --> 02:48:48.709]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:48.909 --> 02:48:51.111]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:51.251 --> 02:48:53.353]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:53.614 --> 02:48:58.558]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:48:58.899 --> 02:49:02.923]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:03.163 --> 02:49:04.944]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:05.024 --> 02:49:15.670]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:15.831 --> 02:49:17.732]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:17.932 --> 02:49:21.754]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the Infowar.

[02:49:47.172 --> 02:49:58.080]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:49:58.340 --> 02:49:58.940]  We're good to go.
[02:50:14.830 --> 02:50:15.330]  That's right.
[02:50:15.510 --> 02:50:22.632]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:22.912 --> 02:50:31.655]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:31.715 --> 02:50:32.175]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.

[02:51:11.920 --> 02:51:12.360]  We're good to go.
[02:51:12.400 --> 02:51:12.760]  I think?
[02:51:40.987 --> 02:51:46.191]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:46.812 --> 02:51:49.134]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:54.478 --> 02:51:55.019]  Ray Deacon.
[02:51:55.039 --> 02:52:02.505]  I want to take a few final calls here from Kim in Texas and a caller in Rhode Island.
[02:52:02.525 --> 02:52:04.507]  I don't know if I'll have time to go to some of the others that are holding.
[02:52:04.987 --> 02:52:05.588]  Heidi and others.
[02:52:06.403 --> 02:52:11.585]  But one more time, give out that phone number and website for folks that want to help you guys in this historical fight for this country.
[02:52:11.865 --> 02:52:20.269]  If you want to call in and talk to Tim, that is 520-457-2320, and that's to start setting up to become a volunteer.
[02:52:20.289 --> 02:52:22.050]  If you want to make donations, it's 877-747-0900.
[02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:23.310]  And our website is MinutemanHQ.com.
[02:52:33.166 --> 02:52:35.408]  That's a great little site to go in and take a look at.
[02:52:35.468 --> 02:52:36.969]  No, I was on it a few days ago.
[02:52:37.029 --> 02:52:37.710]  It's fabulous.
[02:52:38.490 --> 02:52:40.172]  Let's talk to Jim in Texas.
[02:52:40.192 --> 02:52:40.852]  Jim, go ahead.
[02:52:41.913 --> 02:52:46.897]  I had a comment and I had news to get out.
[02:52:47.457 --> 02:52:51.100]  Alex, I'd appreciate it if you could put your guest's name somewhere on your website every day.
[02:52:51.140 --> 02:52:51.861]  I have a hard time.
[02:52:51.921 --> 02:52:53.202]  I may not catch all of your shows.
[02:52:53.702 --> 02:52:54.503]  We do that a lot.
[02:52:54.563 --> 02:52:57.245]  Sometimes we don't because we've had like four or five guests on today.
[02:52:57.605 --> 02:53:01.749]  Okay, well, Tuesday of this week I didn't catch who your guest was and I sent you an email and didn't get a response.
[02:53:01.769 --> 02:53:02.209]  But anyway...
[02:53:03.072 --> 02:53:08.235]  What I've got to get out is, by Monday, we will have PatriotsWanted.org.net and .com out.
[02:53:08.355 --> 02:53:12.077]  We are trying to organize to get a Minute Man March on D.C.
[02:53:12.218 --> 02:53:18.241]  They had the Million Mom March, the Million Man March, We Want a Million Militia March, Million Minute Man March, whatever you want to call it.
[02:53:18.281 --> 02:53:19.682]  Is that affiliated with Rick Stanley?
[02:53:20.122 --> 02:53:20.282]  No.
[02:53:20.423 --> 02:53:24.205]  This is something that me and a guy named John out of Florida have started.
[02:53:24.225 --> 02:53:28.007]  A lot of other people have had that idea, and I think it's good to have marches on D.C.
[02:53:28.027 --> 02:53:29.988]  The problem is the media then just ignores it.
[02:53:31.349 --> 02:53:32.610]  A million people can't be ignored.
[02:53:33.024 --> 02:53:35.105]  I think you do.
[02:53:35.125 --> 02:53:38.006]  Yeah, we've had 500,000 in there, and it's not on the news.
[02:53:38.227 --> 02:53:41.348]  But if you want to talk to me about it, give me a call at the number I gave.
[02:53:41.448 --> 02:53:45.410]  Yeah, this is, I mean, really, I think it's a great idea, so we'll support you in that.
[02:53:46.210 --> 02:53:47.291]  But anything else, Jim?
[02:53:47.831 --> 02:53:50.032]  No, but we've got to do it before they take our guns away.
[02:53:51.413 --> 02:53:56.796]  Well, they're probably going to have some, quote, Al-Qaeda group, and the Al-Qaeda member will be killed after he mows down 75 children.
[02:53:58.448 --> 02:54:03.052]  And the feds are saying that's, quote, going to happen from the southern border, but then ordering the Border Patrol to stand down.
[02:54:03.072 --> 02:54:04.013]  Thanks for the call, Jim.
[02:54:04.333 --> 02:54:05.614]  Comments on that, Doug Ray Deacon?
[02:54:06.292 --> 02:54:08.533]  You know, we've marched on Washington.
[02:54:08.553 --> 02:54:09.514]  We've sent faxes.
[02:54:09.574 --> 02:54:10.334]  We've sent letters.
[02:54:10.394 --> 02:54:11.415]  We've made phone calls.
[02:54:11.795 --> 02:54:15.777]  The only thing in his work that I know of right now is exactly what we're doing.
[02:54:15.797 --> 02:54:17.758]  Physically doing it, not counting on them.
[02:54:17.778 --> 02:54:25.622]  Yep, taking your butt out of the chair and walking down here to this border and standing on that border and saying, it's not going to happen no more.
[02:54:25.762 --> 02:54:26.903]  You've got to physically do it.
[02:54:27.723 --> 02:54:28.423]  One last call.
[02:54:28.443 --> 02:54:29.704]  Who's the caller in Rhode Island?
[02:54:31.305 --> 02:54:31.745]  Guerin.
[02:54:31.765 --> 02:54:32.706]  You're on the air, Guerin.
[02:54:33.026 --> 02:54:34.286]  Yes, a couple of things.
[02:54:34.407 --> 02:54:34.947]  One thing is...
[02:54:35.768 --> 02:54:39.834]  The police in New Hampshire apprehended some illegals, and the feds...
[02:54:40.686 --> 02:54:49.733]  Actually told them to release them, and the police chief, he was all... Sir, there are thousands, literally, I'm not kidding, thousands of those reports I've seen in the last five years.
[02:54:50.073 --> 02:54:55.457]  I see several every day where they got jails, 400,000 with felony records.
[02:54:56.138 --> 02:54:59.720]  Illegals were released out of Texas jails alone last year.
[02:55:00.281 --> 02:55:00.741]  Gray Deacon?
[02:55:01.261 --> 02:55:03.003]  Yeah, and they won't even deport them.
[02:55:03.083 --> 02:55:06.125]  Once they're through with serving their sentence and they're released...
[02:55:06.525 --> 02:55:14.579]  They're released right back into our community, and the authorities know that they're illegally in this country, and they don't give a damn.
[02:55:14.700 --> 02:55:16.423]  But tell us about the New Hampshire case, Guerin.
[02:55:17.064 --> 02:55:19.829]  Yeah, the police apprehended some illegals.
[02:55:20.444 --> 02:55:28.549]  And then the INS came in and told them to release them, and the police chief, he was all upset about this.
[02:55:29.189 --> 02:55:32.571]  And it was reported in the local newspapers in New England.
[02:55:32.631 --> 02:55:34.752]  It's the same, I mean, you see it in Tennessee, Texas.
[02:55:34.792 --> 02:55:38.294]  He stops a carload of illegals with drugs, and the feds say release them.
[02:55:38.554 --> 02:55:39.615]  We're not taking custody.
[02:55:39.815 --> 02:55:44.277]  But your 15-year-old in the back of a car with some 16-year-olds has got some pot.
[02:55:44.558 --> 02:55:45.778]  They're going to throw the book at him.
[02:55:46.779 --> 02:55:47.019]  Yes.
[02:55:47.509 --> 02:55:53.212]  And then also on the History Channel, right now I'm watching, they have it on the Ginterax that released it.
[02:55:53.252 --> 02:55:55.793]  They're admitting that it came from a U.S.
[02:55:55.833 --> 02:55:58.594]  military installation, but they think it was a test.
[02:55:58.734 --> 02:55:59.115]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:55:59.575 --> 02:56:01.456]  Oh, now it's a test that went bad.
[02:56:01.696 --> 02:56:02.256]  Exactly.
[02:56:02.476 --> 02:56:03.337]  Talk about sick.
[02:56:03.497 --> 02:56:04.117]  All right, thank you.
[02:56:04.517 --> 02:56:06.058]  Greg Deacon, thanks for coming on, my friend.
[02:56:06.258 --> 02:56:06.718]  No problem.
[02:56:06.738 --> 02:56:07.399]  Give me a call again.
[02:56:07.439 --> 02:56:08.459]  I'll be glad to join you, Alex.
[02:56:08.619 --> 02:56:09.500]  God bless, my friend.
[02:56:09.540 --> 02:56:10.340]  Great job you're doing.
[02:56:10.360 --> 02:56:11.000]  I commend you.
[02:56:11.401 --> 02:56:12.081]  I salute you.
[02:56:12.957 --> 02:56:26.213]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on the shortwave at 3210 or on your AM or FM stations and the internet at infowars.com or prisonplanet.tv and we broadcast throughout the weekend and I'll see you back here Monday live, 11 a.m.
[02:56:26.293 --> 02:56:26.714]  Central.
[02:56:27.034 --> 02:56:28.656]  God bless you all!
