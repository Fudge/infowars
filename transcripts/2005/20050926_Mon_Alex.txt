[00:00:05.596 --> 00:00:06.236]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.896 --> 00:00:07.937]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.657 --> 00:00:09.777]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.438 --> 00:00:11.238]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.998 --> 00:00:12.959]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.241]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.741 --> 00:00:21.882]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.283 --> 00:00:32.707]  Well, with Hurricane Katrina, they thought that the Gulf Coast could dodge the bullet, and they hadn't.
[00:00:33.698 --> 00:00:46.709]  Dodged a bullet and, as you know, destroyed much of the real estate in the city of New Orleans and surrounding areas, but it does look like we dodged a bullet with Hurricane Rita.
[00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:55.235]  A few deaths from grounding and a lot of property loss, but in the aggregate, they're talking about $5 billion versus $200-250 billion.
[00:01:04.855 --> 00:01:23.104]  And so I guess we can close the chapter of Hurricane Rita other than the government saying evacuate and the amazing 100 mile plus long traffic jams out of Houston, Texas into Austin and into Dallas and into San Antonio.
[00:01:25.177 --> 00:01:26.938]  Shades of what will happen.
[00:01:27.038 --> 00:01:37.525]  Mere inklings, mere shadows of what will happen if suitcase nukes ever start detonating around this country.
[00:01:39.346 --> 00:01:41.727]  And is the federal government telling the public to be prepared?
[00:01:41.747 --> 00:01:49.132]  Are they telling the public to have potassium iodate as the number one thing you need to save your life and your family's life, your animals' lives?
[00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:49.852]  No.
[00:01:50.412 --> 00:01:52.714]  Are they telling you to be prepared in any other way?
[00:01:52.734 --> 00:01:52.774]  No.
[00:01:53.877 --> 00:01:57.678]  They're just moving to get your guns on many different fronts.
[00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:10.841]  Speaking of guns, there has been a major victory for firearms owners and freedom in the Louisiana period.
[00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:19.243]  A suit was filed, obviously you know this because we had them on, by the Second Amendment Foundation and the NRA
[00:02:21.415 --> 00:02:28.999]  Trying to stop the gun confiscation going on in New Orleans and surrounding parishes, counties there in the state.
[00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:34.021]  Yes, it was going on statewide under FEMA command.
[00:02:36.142 --> 00:02:50.369]  And we now have an order by the federal judge and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana Friday saying, knock it off, stop it.
[00:02:51.070 --> 00:03:15.809]  I was driving in today listening to Gary Brownfield on the radio, and he had a caller talking about something I was well aware of, but that I haven't talked about enough, about how most of the statistics, how major universities, this particular one was done by a medical center, most of the statistics, most of the numbers of people that die from gunshot wounds are people that have brain tumors or bone cancer and are in excruciating pain.
[00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.310]  I'm not defending suicide, but who can blame them?
[00:03:18.771 --> 00:03:20.392]  Who blow their own heads off.
[00:03:21.664 --> 00:03:33.590]  And I knew that the largest portion of that, maybe I should have some of those professors on with those numbers as we did a few years ago when that came out, but he was reading out of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram with those numbers from last year.
[00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:45.415]  But also then the next biggest portion of those killed by firearms are gangland shootings, gang members, gang wars shooting each other.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:56.126]  And then the next biggest group is citizens shooting home intruders and liquor store robbers and police shooting bank robbers.
[00:03:56.187 --> 00:04:05.713]  Yes, they even put into the crime statistics what firearms deaths, the ravage, the murders by guns, people shot by cops.
[00:04:06.874 --> 00:04:12.938]  That means the guy coming at the police foaming at the mouth with a butcher knife in his hand or with a machine gun in his hand.
[00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.400]  The gangbangers, all of them,
[00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:17.507]  Go into those statistics.
[00:04:18.808 --> 00:04:28.433]  And so when you're done with it, you know, actual numbers of murders and actual numbers of people that have engaged in criminal activities with guns, it is just pathetically low.
[00:04:29.534 --> 00:04:34.537]  All right, we're going to break, and we're going to come back and go to some really serious news.
[00:04:34.937 --> 00:04:38.239]  Bill would permit DNA collection from all those arrested.
[00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.820]  That's here in America.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.221]  That's another one.
[00:04:41.261 --> 00:04:43.262]  In one year, Halliburton stock doubles.
[00:04:43.342 --> 00:04:44.803]  It's group death doubled.
[00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:48.737]  Hillary wants to regulate the internet.
[00:04:50.217 --> 00:04:52.959]  London bomber mastermind was working for MI6.
[00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.441]  Another mainstream news article on this.
[00:04:56.861 --> 00:04:59.183]  Bush heads to Colorado for military takeover drill.
[00:04:59.223 --> 00:05:00.183]  Did that last Friday.
[00:05:00.404 --> 00:05:00.964]  We'll tell you about it.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.464]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:06.405]  Hello, my friends.
[00:05:06.505 --> 00:05:07.306]  Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.626 --> 00:05:12.312]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.653 --> 00:05:17.078]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:21.664]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.884 --> 00:05:24.747]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.827 --> 00:05:29.491]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.691 --> 00:05:34.115]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.355 --> 00:05:41.562]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.822 --> 00:05:44.264]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[00:05:44.404 --> 00:05:46.146]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:03.467]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:03.847 --> 00:06:09.589]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:09.829 --> 00:06:14.971]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:24.575]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:24.895 --> 00:06:25.656]  We're good to go.
[00:06:25.676 --> 00:06:26.236]  We're good to go.
[00:06:46.837 --> 00:06:52.026]  The standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:53.168]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:53.188 --> 00:06:54.330]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:02.662 --> 00:07:03.803]  We're good to go.
[00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:32.821]  Or call 435-586-8125.
[00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:33.222]  That's 435-586-8125.
[00:07:33.362 --> 00:07:34.942]  And use promotional code 18222.
[00:08:02.518 --> 00:08:08.539]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.159 --> 00:08:12.180]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.940]  It's Monday, the 26th day of September 2005.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.241]  We're going to be live, my friends.
[00:08:16.301 --> 00:08:18.981]  Here live for the next 2 hours and 51 and a half minutes.
[00:08:31.167 --> 00:08:36.550]  The toll-free number to join us on air, to get involved on air, wide-open phones throughout the broadcast today, is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:37.230]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:47.536]  For those that are joining us for the first time today, you're driving along through the Rocky Mountains, or across the plains of Texas, or up in the beautiful woodlands of northern Texas,
[00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:06.609]  Northern New York, and you're tuning in for the first time, and you're saying, what is this broadcast, what is this show about?
[00:09:07.229 --> 00:09:08.189]  It's about freedom!
[00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:15.992]  You know, I don't start my show each day thinking, hmm, how can I expose the Democrats as a bunch of idiots?
[00:09:16.512 --> 00:09:18.812]  And how can I make the Republicans look good?
[00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:24.394]  Or, how can I expose the Republicans as a bunch of out-of-control idiots?
[00:09:25.902 --> 00:09:29.863]  Fat cats, and how can I show the Democrats as the saviors?
[00:09:32.303 --> 00:09:38.404]  No, I wake up every day and I simply go and I say, okay, are there examples of where we're getting more freedom?
[00:09:38.924 --> 00:09:40.185]  Of where we're getting more liberty?
[00:09:40.265 --> 00:09:41.665]  Of where tyranny is in trouble?
[00:09:42.225 --> 00:09:43.765]  Of where corruption is in trouble?
[00:09:44.225 --> 00:09:45.646]  Because I want to talk about those.
[00:09:46.426 --> 00:09:49.206]  Or are there a bunch of examples of where we're losing freedom?
[00:09:49.687 --> 00:09:52.107]  And where a classical police state is being set up?
[00:09:54.537 --> 00:10:10.641]  And every day we see the evidence of the two parties working in tandem, like World Wrestling Federation theatrical actors putting on a display of ritualized combat.
[00:10:11.061 --> 00:10:12.841]  For you, it is staged.
[00:10:13.341 --> 00:10:17.402]  And most Americans now know this, but they only know it at an instinctive level.
[00:10:17.422 --> 00:10:21.503]  They'll go, yeah, there's not a dime's worth of difference, but when you really get down to discussing how
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.362]  It's actual theater.
[00:10:25.142 --> 00:10:26.764]  The average person is not aware of that.
[00:10:26.804 --> 00:10:29.847]  The average person doesn't know that the Clintons work for the Bushes.
[00:10:30.427 --> 00:10:33.970]  The average person doesn't know they've been narcotics dealers going back over 20 years.
[00:10:34.491 --> 00:10:38.314]  The average individual doesn't know that we have a military industrial complex coup d'etat back in 1963.
[00:10:38.374 --> 00:10:39.255]  The average person...
[00:10:41.697 --> 00:10:44.940]  Doesn't know that there are public plans for the U.S.
[00:10:44.981 --> 00:10:49.685]  government to carry out terror attacks against the American people, to blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:10:50.205 --> 00:11:02.937]  The average American doesn't know that these plans have been declassified and that our government has been doing this for at least 50 years, blowing up school buses full of children, bombing major cities, blowing up ships.
[00:11:03.778 --> 00:11:05.520]  These are the things we talk about here.
[00:11:06.849 --> 00:11:08.652]  We talk about real issues.
[00:11:09.252 --> 00:11:12.297]  Israel admits that they, with U.S.
[00:11:12.337 --> 00:11:17.624]  government funding of $3 billion in the 1950s or 1960, forcibly radiated 100,000 Jewish children.
[00:11:24.508 --> 00:11:32.072]  They would tell the parents they were going to the dentist's office or that they were going to have a new treatment for ringworm, even children that didn't have ringworm.
[00:11:32.392 --> 00:11:34.513]  Again, the fungus grows in a circle.
[00:11:35.053 --> 00:11:38.855]  Hence the wives' tale of it's a worm.
[00:11:40.982 --> 00:11:46.185]  And they would take them and radiate them with 3,000 to 5,000 times the safe levels.
[00:11:46.285 --> 00:11:47.906]  Most children died on the table.
[00:11:48.326 --> 00:11:49.327]  Some died within a week.
[00:11:49.827 --> 00:11:52.509]  And only a few survive until today.
[00:11:53.129 --> 00:11:55.430]  Absolute cripples, mentally retarded.
[00:11:57.932 --> 00:12:01.374]  Now, I talked a lot about that last week because nobody else is talking about it.
[00:12:01.494 --> 00:12:04.876]  And you need to know about it.
[00:12:05.516 --> 00:12:09.038]  Stop and Google Israel test radiation on children.
[00:12:09.682 --> 00:12:10.182]  And you'll get it.
[00:12:10.362 --> 00:12:18.465]  My point is that if our government will do that, if this government will do that, if the Israeli government will do that, what will any of these governments do?
[00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:21.526]  Why do you trust them so much?
[00:12:21.926 --> 00:12:24.807]  Why are you amazed when they do bad things to you?
[00:12:25.247 --> 00:12:29.849]  The founding fathers, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.081]  They said don't trust the government.
[00:12:34.121 --> 00:12:35.242]  Keep control of it.
[00:12:35.582 --> 00:12:39.765]  It will always do horrible things to you, especially when it gets big.
[00:12:43.087 --> 00:12:45.748]  It's really common sense.
[00:12:45.828 --> 00:12:47.429]  That's all we talk about here.
[00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:53.673]  It's simply common sense.
[00:12:53.733 --> 00:12:55.534]  That's all we're trying to do.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.700]  It has come out.
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:00.140]  It has been confirmed.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:02.081]  It has been in the London Guardian.
[00:13:02.141 --> 00:13:04.001]  It has been covered by the BBC.
[00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:08.162]  It has been covered by the European papers and the Arabic papers.
[00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:20.184]  We, of course, have been on the vanguard of connecting the dots and bringing all the information into key data pages for you at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:13:20.644 --> 00:13:25.245]  The Israelis, the U.S., and the British have all been caught.
[00:13:25.285 --> 00:13:26.105]  Let me say this again.
[00:13:27.651 --> 00:13:46.186]  Have all been caught bombing and shooting and torturing and kidnapping our own contractors, our own intelligence agents, Iraqi police, our own troops.
[00:13:47.567 --> 00:13:50.189]  You understand, it's not debatable...
[00:13:51.764 --> 00:13:57.429]  They will hide it in plain view in paragraph 10, page 2, of these news articles.
[00:13:58.229 --> 00:14:01.312]  Why did the British have to storm the Basra prison?
[00:14:01.872 --> 00:14:06.236]  Why wouldn't the Basra governor appointed by the British not give them up?
[00:14:07.197 --> 00:14:15.844]  Because they caught them shooting Iraqi policemen with a truckload of explosives with huge fake beards on, posing as Arabs.
[00:14:17.153 --> 00:14:31.625]  They've caught the Israelis, not once, but twice, shooting at Marine bases, hardened Marine bases, rocketing Marine bases, and Marines sneak up behind them, capture them, and it's Israelis dressed up like Arabs, folks.
[00:14:32.165 --> 00:14:35.668]  You know, guys with buzz haircuts, with Big Star David tattoos.
[00:14:36.348 --> 00:14:39.291]  They have caught our own troops doing it.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:45.062]  And until you realize that, you're going to continue to be fooled.
[00:14:45.562 --> 00:14:47.103]  You're going, why on earth?
[00:14:47.183 --> 00:14:49.444]  I mean, I've had people walk up to me on the street.
[00:14:49.764 --> 00:14:50.885]  Happened yesterday twice.
[00:14:50.965 --> 00:14:51.385]  Twice.
[00:14:51.885 --> 00:14:52.326]  Twice.
[00:14:53.986 --> 00:14:55.447]  Alex, I heard your show.
[00:14:55.547 --> 00:14:57.848]  Why would our government carry out terror?
[00:14:58.449 --> 00:14:58.869]  And Alex...
[00:14:59.841 --> 00:15:02.023]  One person mentioned that, and the other guy walked up to me.
[00:15:02.043 --> 00:15:02.883]  These are good old boys.
[00:15:02.923 --> 00:15:05.625]  I mean, well, they're not evil.
[00:15:05.645 --> 00:15:07.366]  They think the whole world thinks like they do.
[00:15:07.386 --> 00:15:12.289]  I'd never do that, so why would my president?
[00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:15.391]  I remember people going, Bill Clinton, my president.
[00:15:15.791 --> 00:15:18.153]  It's so possessive, the way they say it.
[00:15:18.173 --> 00:15:21.335]  Like you're in some power league because you worship them.
[00:15:21.375 --> 00:15:22.236]  It gives you power.
[00:15:23.576 --> 00:15:25.818]  The guy walks up to me, and he told me last night,
[00:15:27.805 --> 00:15:30.047]  He said, I'm a contractor in Iraq.
[00:15:31.929 --> 00:15:33.850]  I work for Halliburton.
[00:15:35.051 --> 00:15:36.753]  He said, I know a lot of what you're saying is true.
[00:15:36.773 --> 00:15:40.936]  Everybody's talking about it over there, about how our own government is carrying out the terror.
[00:15:40.956 --> 00:15:43.919]  And he goes, a lot of people are saying that at the Marine Corps base I'm at.
[00:15:43.939 --> 00:15:44.659]  He's in an air base.
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.122]  But he said, I just can't understand it.
[00:15:48.242 --> 00:15:50.284]  Why, why, why, why?
[00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:57.345]  Well, I mean, I hate to be obnoxious, but it's elementary, my dear Watson.
[00:15:57.726 --> 00:15:58.987]  I mean, it really is elementary.
[00:16:00.968 --> 00:16:03.030]  Does Halliburton make more money?
[00:16:03.090 --> 00:16:04.391]  Does Brown and Root make more money?
[00:16:04.411 --> 00:16:05.792]  Does Bechtel make more money?
[00:16:05.812 --> 00:16:07.454]  Does Lockheed Martin make more money?
[00:16:07.654 --> 00:16:09.495]  Does the Carlaw Group make more money?
[00:16:09.756 --> 00:16:11.197]  Does BP make more money?
[00:16:12.836 --> 00:16:13.096]  Now, again...
[00:16:31.349 --> 00:16:39.792]  If the goal is getting into a quagmire to have no-bid contracts, then do you want to be there six months or ten years?
[00:16:39.972 --> 00:16:40.732]  Now, come on!
[00:16:40.953 --> 00:16:42.013]  I'm asking you a question.
[00:16:42.333 --> 00:16:50.496]  Do you want a big, juicy contract for six months, or would you like that big, juicy contract for ten years?
[00:16:51.976 --> 00:16:53.077]  Okay, there's your answer.
[00:16:53.157 --> 00:16:53.997]  Now, do you understand?
[00:16:54.037 --> 00:16:55.778]  It isn't about democracy.
[00:16:55.798 --> 00:16:57.558]  It isn't about freedom.
[00:16:57.839 --> 00:16:58.899]  It isn't about anything.
[00:16:59.915 --> 00:17:04.616]  It is about destabilizing that region, having permanent bases there to attack Iran and Syria.
[00:17:04.797 --> 00:17:08.778]  Vic Cheney, by the way, has said this in reports, white papers he's put out, pre-war.
[00:17:09.838 --> 00:17:14.760]  And it's about hundreds of billions every few years in weapons sales and in contracts.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:25.003]  And I was talking to this electrician last night, and he admitted that he makes five times what he used to as an electrician here.
[00:17:28.823 --> 00:17:30.464]  Five times.
[00:17:31.365 --> 00:17:38.491]  And he said, oh, and believe me, Halliburton's getting two or three times for the work I'm doing what they're even paying me.
[00:17:39.552 --> 00:17:41.713]  That's how lavish all of this is.
[00:17:45.677 --> 00:17:46.377]  It's amazing.
[00:17:47.378 --> 00:17:49.079]  And so that's what's happening right now.
[00:17:50.681 --> 00:17:56.185]  And so you can sit there and say whatever you want about this war, and you can just say, I don't believe it.
[00:17:58.055 --> 00:17:59.556]  I don't believe you, Alex.
[00:17:59.616 --> 00:18:00.617]  Well, don't then.
[00:18:00.677 --> 00:18:01.218]  Just don't.
[00:18:02.278 --> 00:18:03.179]  Don't believe any of it.
[00:18:05.221 --> 00:18:20.852]  There is a major report out by Criminology Magazine, very prestigious, about how the mass bomber commander in the two string of bombings July 7th and July 21st in London was MI6.
[00:18:20.992 --> 00:18:26.657]  Of course, we've had former top counterterrorism FBI experts on and
[00:18:27.250 --> 00:18:28.971]  Justice Department people want to talk about that.
[00:18:29.071 --> 00:18:32.113]  It's been in the big British papers.
[00:18:32.133 --> 00:18:33.213]  That's why they're protecting him.
[00:18:33.914 --> 00:18:36.415]  Well, of course the head bomber's MI6.
[00:18:38.196 --> 00:18:41.397]  You know, that's like saying Adolf Hitler has a mustache.
[00:18:41.898 --> 00:18:45.059]  Of course he does, right underneath his nose, on his upper lip.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.041]  It's like saying the sun came up this morning.
[00:18:48.121 --> 00:18:50.162]  I mean, it's elementary, my dear Watson.
[00:18:51.081 --> 00:18:52.602]  People's approval ratings are plunging.
[00:18:52.642 --> 00:18:54.102]  People are demanding to get out of the war.
[00:18:54.702 --> 00:18:58.004]  And there's bombings in London, and Blair gets a 20% point increase out of it.
[00:18:58.604 --> 00:19:01.465]  And gets to turn London into more of a police state and take more freedoms.
[00:19:02.725 --> 00:19:06.927]  By the way, they are openly announcing martial law for all of America.
[00:19:07.007 --> 00:19:08.647]  That's what the endoplasmic commentatus is.
[00:19:09.668 --> 00:19:16.770]  And in plain view, they did a martial law takeover drill Friday into Saturday.
[00:19:17.471 --> 00:19:17.951]  An open...
[00:19:18.729 --> 00:19:28.652]  Martial law, Northcom drill, just a few days ago, and it was in the Washington Post, and we will detail that coming up.
[00:19:28.872 --> 00:19:32.053]  And Hillary Clinton wants to restrict the Internet.
[00:19:33.654 --> 00:19:37.675]  Wait a minute, how can you be against Bush, but also against Hillary?
[00:19:38.275 --> 00:19:39.255]  They're crime partners.
[00:19:39.495 --> 00:19:41.976]  Rupert Murdoch every week has four-hour meetings with Hillary.
[00:19:42.356 --> 00:19:43.457]  It's all staged, okay?
[00:19:44.437 --> 00:19:45.217]  You understand, folks?
[00:19:45.237 --> 00:19:46.718]  I mean, it's actually staged.
[00:19:46.758 --> 00:19:47.758]  They're laughing at you.
[00:19:48.416 --> 00:19:49.798]  These people vacation together.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.444]  They eat $600 meals together every night.
[00:19:54.445 --> 00:19:55.206]  You understand that?
[00:19:55.226 --> 00:19:57.189]  Alright, we'll be right back, folks.
[00:19:57.209 --> 00:19:57.650]  Stay with us.

[00:21:10.757 --> 00:21:22.019]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.

[00:21:52.448 --> 00:21:55.010]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[00:21:55.070 --> 00:21:57.152]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[00:22:16.081 --> 00:22:21.547]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[00:22:21.968 --> 00:22:25.091]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[00:22:25.352 --> 00:22:27.194]  The bank paid you 1%.
[00:22:27.254 --> 00:22:30.277]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[00:22:30.818 --> 00:22:33.060]  Here is reality.
[00:22:33.421 --> 00:22:36.985]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[00:22:37.461 --> 00:22:37.842]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:02.845 --> 00:23:05.247]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:23:19.855 --> 00:23:20.235]  We're good to go.
[00:23:20.255 --> 00:23:20.596]  I think?

[00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:04.802]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:24:05.382 --> 00:24:08.664]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:22.738]  I mean, look, we've got the Bush worshippers, the global government worshippers, who are tuning in right now, and they're just like, look, there's no way our own government's shooting our own troops.
[00:24:24.059 --> 00:24:26.260]  No way our own government's bombing stuff.
[00:24:27.401 --> 00:24:28.402]  I don't want to hear it.
[00:24:29.002 --> 00:24:30.664]  Well, okay, be suckers then.
[00:24:30.744 --> 00:24:31.905]  Enjoy being conned.
[00:24:31.965 --> 00:24:33.406]  Enjoy them laughing at you.
[00:24:34.407 --> 00:24:34.507]  Look.
[00:24:34.527 --> 00:24:34.627]  Look.
[00:24:36.642 --> 00:24:38.103]  Someday, you're going to wake up.
[00:24:38.243 --> 00:24:40.564]  Someday, the troops are going to slap you upside the head.
[00:24:40.584 --> 00:24:43.905]  Do you understand they've been caught red-handed over and over again?
[00:24:43.925 --> 00:24:48.547]  That by bombing the Shiites, that then makes them attack the Sunnis.
[00:24:48.587 --> 00:24:54.769]  By bombing the Sunnis, that makes them attack the Shiites to keep things stirred up so the country's vulcanized and weak.
[00:24:55.930 --> 00:25:00.632]  And then our own government goes around shooting policemen and then shooting our own troops.
[00:25:02.612 --> 00:25:03.893]  I mean, you may think it's cute.
[00:25:04.514 --> 00:25:07.415]  Have our own troops bleed to death and die, but I don't think it's funny.
[00:25:07.435 --> 00:25:11.556]  In your own sick, twisted logic, well, war's hell, Alex.
[00:25:11.836 --> 00:25:14.457]  They're smarter than I am up there at the Pentagon.
[00:25:16.257 --> 00:25:18.618]  Well, you know, Pat Tillman's parents aren't saying that.
[00:25:19.338 --> 00:25:22.979]  Pat got killed in friendly fire, and it's suspicious how he died.
[00:25:22.999 --> 00:25:26.840]  We know he's been complaining about not being able to go after the Taliban.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.901]  They flew those guys out to safety.
[00:25:28.941 --> 00:25:29.681]  That's all admitted.
[00:25:31.266 --> 00:25:41.170]  And he goes over there, and he's in the Rangers, and they shoot him, and then they have this story about how he was charging an Al-Qaeda outpost and battling them to the end, and he killed so many of them.
[00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:44.091]  Turns out there were no, quote, Al-Qaeda anywhere around there.
[00:25:44.131 --> 00:25:50.633]  It was just our own troops shot him dead, and then they tried to tell the family to shut up and lie, and they said, we don't lie.
[00:25:50.653 --> 00:25:54.555]  And I've even heard some people attack the Tillman's family now.
[00:25:54.855 --> 00:25:56.556]  It's like they attack Cindy Sheehan.
[00:25:56.796 --> 00:25:58.656]  That lady ought to just shut up.
[00:25:58.837 --> 00:25:59.577]  I'm sick of her.
[00:26:00.723 --> 00:26:03.392]  How dare her use her son's death?
[00:26:03.994 --> 00:26:04.957]  It's her son!
[00:26:04.997 --> 00:26:06.602]  You're the one using her son's death.
[00:26:09.622 --> 00:26:11.143]  I mean, it's just sick, folks.
[00:26:11.203 --> 00:26:29.850]  So worship the government all day as Bush appoints anti-gun judges and anti-gun people as the Attorney General, and as Bush massively increases the spending to record levels, and as he expands every big socialist government agency, and as he tries to have total blanket amnesty.
[00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.131]  Just go ahead and say he's conservative.
[00:26:32.231 --> 00:26:32.791]  Okay!
[00:26:32.951 --> 00:26:33.451]  Fine!
[00:26:34.852 --> 00:26:35.272]  Fine!
[00:26:36.733 --> 00:26:39.654]  Look, it doesn't matter whether it's Hillary Clinton or George Bush.
[00:26:39.755 --> 00:26:50.300]  Boy, with that new First Lady show, where Commander-in-Chief or whatever it is, where some woman is president, and they're really greasing the skids for Hillary.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:55.462]  And suddenly when Hillary gets elected, conservatives will be upset about the Patriot Act.
[00:26:55.522 --> 00:26:59.064]  And suddenly conservatives will be upset about the gun control.
[00:26:59.144 --> 00:27:03.266]  And suddenly, yeah, Bush didn't do a very good job.
[00:27:03.766 --> 00:27:05.147]  It'll be too late then, won't it?
[00:27:06.894 --> 00:27:07.194]  Won't it?
[00:27:09.275 --> 00:27:17.699]  And then you can complain when the Republicans vote with her and then there'll be a big terror attack and Hillary will declare martial law and keep us all safe.
[00:27:17.739 --> 00:27:24.682]  And suddenly the Democrats and all these groups that were afraid of the military on the streets and all of this, suddenly they're going to love it.
[00:27:24.962 --> 00:27:27.263]  It's our time now to punish you!
[00:27:28.593 --> 00:27:29.834]  Evil right wingers.
[00:27:30.414 --> 00:27:40.202]  And Hillary's already said she wants to go into Iran, and all the Democrats will line up, and conservatives will step up beside her and go, I didn't think I liked her, but I guess she's all right.
[00:27:40.282 --> 00:27:41.583]  I like Hillary.
[00:27:42.783 --> 00:27:46.646]  Let's talk to Dana in Seattle, Washington.
[00:27:46.706 --> 00:27:47.067]  Welcome.
[00:27:47.847 --> 00:27:48.167]  Hello.
[00:27:48.488 --> 00:27:48.828]  Hi.
[00:27:49.288 --> 00:27:49.468]  Hi.
[00:27:49.488 --> 00:27:50.449]  How are you, Alex?
[00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:52.150]  Welcome.
[00:27:52.731 --> 00:27:53.071]  Thank you.
[00:27:53.812 --> 00:27:56.213]  I just wanted to call and give you some information.
[00:27:56.253 --> 00:27:58.673]  You may already know about it, and you may have already discussed it.
[00:27:58.713 --> 00:27:59.273]  I don't know.
[00:27:59.293 --> 00:28:06.655]  But I was trying to find funding regarding this country's government messing with weather technology.
[00:28:07.236 --> 00:28:16.398]  I found an article in your InfoWars.com articles, and it's dated May 7th by a reporter with Wired News.
[00:28:17.238 --> 00:28:23.480]  And it talks about that specific topic regarding a PhD doctor, Ross Hoffman.
[00:28:25.625 --> 00:28:41.557]  In 2001, he was granted a research fund to look into this kind of thing through NIAC, which is an acronym for NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts, which are considered weird studies.
[00:28:42.077 --> 00:28:51.784]  But this happens to be where they're doing a lot of the research and development for all kinds of space, atmospheric, other planets, vegetation, this kind of stuff.
[00:28:53.085 --> 00:28:53.686]  And he did...
[00:28:54.813 --> 00:29:02.154]  Funding for stimulating... Let me get the title off of every page of this research paper.
[00:29:02.194 --> 00:29:03.554]  Yeah, no, I posted it.
[00:29:04.195 --> 00:29:05.915]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:29:05.935 --> 00:29:09.856]  We have Secretary of Defense Cohen talking about weather control being real.
[00:29:10.316 --> 00:29:16.137]  We have K. Belly Hutchinson introducing a bill, what is it, 517 a few months ago, to set up an official U.S.
[00:29:16.177 --> 00:29:18.797]  government department of weather modification.
[00:29:19.637 --> 00:29:24.018]  They have weather channel shows about us controlling the weather in Vietnam, so it's real.
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.381]  Well, the title of his is Moving a Simulated Hurricane.
[00:29:29.062 --> 00:29:30.622]  And his research was done.
[00:29:30.642 --> 00:29:32.043]  Yeah, you know what?
[00:29:32.063 --> 00:29:33.223]  That's an important point.
[00:29:33.243 --> 00:29:34.003]  Just stay there.
[00:29:34.164 --> 00:29:35.684]  We'll come back after break, Dana.
[00:29:36.204 --> 00:29:37.125]  We'll let you finish up.
[00:29:37.145 --> 00:29:40.246]  We'll go to John, Richard, Steve, Robert, and many others.
[00:29:40.286 --> 00:29:41.466]  Toll-free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:29:41.486 --> 00:29:45.848]  PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.net are just two of the great websites.
[00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:52.779]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.863]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.785 --> 00:29:58.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:08.635]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:08.855 --> 00:30:13.859]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.199 --> 00:30:22.105]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:22.245 --> 00:30:29.311]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:29.511 --> 00:30:29.731]  Thank you.
[00:30:49.957 --> 00:30:51.138]  866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time, that's 866-885-6625

[00:32:01.943 --> 00:32:04.324]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:32:04.564 --> 00:32:08.386]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:32:08.726 --> 00:32:09.546]  Read the labels.
[00:32:09.966 --> 00:32:14.108]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:14.308 --> 00:32:18.510]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:32:18.871 --> 00:32:23.753]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:32:24.133 --> 00:32:27.695]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.

[00:33:07.928 --> 00:33:10.930]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:14.132]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:33:14.152 --> 00:33:17.514]  I'm the guy who's a boss on this highway.
[00:33:17.774 --> 00:33:20.455]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:33:20.495 --> 00:33:24.017]  Ladies and gentlemen, Hannah up in Seattle, Washington.
[00:33:24.057 --> 00:33:26.419]  We're going to go back to you in a second.
[00:33:27.479 --> 00:33:31.321]  Brought up weather modification, weather control in a Wired News article about a U.S.
[00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:38.424]  government study about weather manipulation or creation of hurricanes that Wired News talked about, reported on.
[00:33:38.444 --> 00:33:41.325]  Let me be clear on all of this.
[00:33:41.365 --> 00:33:43.225]  You know, I get criticized from both sides.
[00:33:45.566 --> 00:33:49.348]  People back in the 1920s thought folks that had cars were weirdos.
[00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:56.671]  But pretty rapidly, the horse and buggy manufacturers were put out of business.
[00:33:57.882 --> 00:34:04.725]  So were the folks that were selling riding crops, or the little short whips you use to direct your horse.
[00:34:06.286 --> 00:34:09.547]  There weren't quite as many bridles and saddles sold either.
[00:34:10.868 --> 00:34:14.429]  And so people have trouble dealing with being in the future.
[00:34:16.270 --> 00:34:20.272]  People always saw the year 2000 as this far-off time
[00:34:21.107 --> 00:34:32.792]  Where we'd all be wearing silver spacesuits and flying around with jetpacks is meet George Jetson, Jane, his wife, and daughter Judy, his son Elroy.
[00:34:33.253 --> 00:34:34.213]  What's the dog's name?
[00:34:35.254 --> 00:34:38.455]  And then he works for Stanley Sprockets or whatever.
[00:34:38.475 --> 00:34:41.837]  I forget.
[00:34:41.917 --> 00:34:45.858]  The point is that we are in 2005.
[00:34:48.226 --> 00:34:58.653]  And the technologies that our government has, that the private interests that control our government have, are about 30 years ahead of what we're now publicly seeing.
[00:35:00.195 --> 00:35:03.437]  And weather modification is not something that's even been hidden.
[00:35:04.377 --> 00:35:14.945]  They can steer, they can control, they can worsen or lessen the strength of a hurricane or of any type of storm for that matter.
[00:35:15.823 --> 00:35:24.170]  Ibbots in the areas where they have these antenna arrays, and they can also engage in the older technology of cloud seeding.
[00:35:25.711 --> 00:35:39.362]  I mean, a small Cessna with a few bags of chemicals can ensure that a large cloud formation is going to produce precipitation, but you do it with a big jet with thousands of gallons of it, you're talking guaranteed big time.
[00:35:41.584 --> 00:35:43.466]  So all of this is real, but...
[00:35:46.563 --> 00:35:57.968]  I then don't have absolute proof that our government or some government or some entity, you know, like chaos or something, is in control and is doing this.
[00:35:58.768 --> 00:36:04.371]  I mean, we had bad hurricanes, Category 5s in 1900, three or four of them that hit the coast.
[00:36:05.350 --> 00:36:09.332]  I mean, we've had this... People think as a volcano goes off, it's the end of the world.
[00:36:09.372 --> 00:36:16.295]  I mean, we've had cycles where volcanoes were blowing up all over the planet, covering entire civilizations thousands of years ago.
[00:36:18.235 --> 00:36:19.356]  I mean, this stuff happens.
[00:36:19.416 --> 00:36:26.859]  I mean, they had the big San Francisco earthquake that killed thousands of people, and that's before they had tectonic seismic weapons.
[00:36:26.919 --> 00:36:28.900]  So, do these things exist?
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:29.360]  Certainly.
[00:36:31.290 --> 00:36:33.871]  But are we also seeing natural cycles?
[00:36:33.931 --> 00:36:35.692]  Can natural cycles cause this?
[00:36:36.112 --> 00:36:48.457]  Can the sun being in a particularly violent top of a cycle right now really putting off more radiation, more heat than we've ever seen as we started recording the sun in the last hundred years?
[00:36:49.117 --> 00:36:50.518]  Could that be causing all of this?
[00:36:50.578 --> 00:36:50.998]  Certainly.
[00:36:52.472 --> 00:36:53.313]  I do know this, though.
[00:36:53.333 --> 00:37:01.280]  The government is seizing on this to sell us police state, to sell us an end to posse commentatus and total martial law, and I'll tell that a little bit later.
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:05.343]  It's very important and near and dear to my heart, one of my main areas of study.
[00:37:07.084 --> 00:37:19.495]  I know that they're certainly saying it's global warming, so we better have a global tax and global regulation, Clinton's global initiative, and Barbara Streisand and Warren Beatty and all this loyal opposition.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:30.767]  They're all coming to the rescue of the globalists, trying to push us now through these crises into this one-world government that has nothing to do with keeping you safe from hurricanes.
[00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:49.601]  So I get criticized on both sides why I talk about weather modification, why I'll actually read a quote by Secretary of Defense Cohen, April 22, 1997, why I'll actually read Kay Bailey Hutchinson's bill to create a Department of Weather Control of weather modification.
[00:37:50.689 --> 00:37:53.831]  Why, we'll actually post it and link to it at the Library of Congress.
[00:37:53.891 --> 00:37:58.813]  Why, we'll actually link to a Wired Magazine news story.
[00:37:58.893 --> 00:38:03.816]  Why, we'll actually link to Scott Stevens and his findings, the meteorologist.
[00:38:03.876 --> 00:38:04.136]  Why?
[00:38:04.156 --> 00:38:08.678]  But again, I get criticized by that crowd.
[00:38:08.698 --> 00:38:14.942]  Then I get criticized as, Jones has proven himself a government agent, this time for sure.
[00:38:16.822 --> 00:38:19.704]  Why, he won't come out and say it's the government.
[00:38:23.516 --> 00:38:24.897]  That's because I don't know.
[00:38:25.297 --> 00:38:27.758]  I know it's the government carrying out the bombings in London.
[00:38:28.878 --> 00:38:30.379]  Caught red-handed and we got the motive.
[00:38:31.299 --> 00:38:32.759]  Caught seven ways from Sunday.
[00:38:32.799 --> 00:38:35.821]  I mean, just caught up one side and down the other in triplicate.
[00:38:36.521 --> 00:38:37.521]  Signed, sealed, delivered.
[00:38:38.722 --> 00:38:39.802]  No ifs, ands, or buts.
[00:38:39.822 --> 00:38:42.083]  What they call an orgy of evidence.
[00:38:43.129 --> 00:38:47.331]  We know our own government's trying to destabilize Iraq and killing our own troops.
[00:38:47.711 --> 00:38:49.231]  Caught red-handed over and over again.
[00:38:49.771 --> 00:38:51.252]  We know the globalists carried out 9-11.
[00:38:51.692 --> 00:38:57.254]  Caught red-handed, in triplicate, no debating it, just it's ridiculous how much evidence there is.
[00:38:57.654 --> 00:39:01.716]  We know they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and mercury to brain damage you and hurt you.
[00:39:02.016 --> 00:39:03.757]  Part of their population control program.
[00:39:04.397 --> 00:39:05.337]  It's their public program.
[00:39:05.357 --> 00:39:06.137]  We have the documents.
[00:39:07.058 --> 00:39:07.718]  Henry Kissinger.
[00:39:08.453 --> 00:39:11.977]  We know the IMF and World Bank on purpose bring down third world economies.
[00:39:11.997 --> 00:39:13.178]  They're not there trying to help them.
[00:39:13.218 --> 00:39:13.718]  How do we know?
[00:39:14.039 --> 00:39:18.263]  Joseph Sickles, their chief economist, quit, and we got 2,000 pages of their own documents.
[00:39:19.524 --> 00:39:25.750]  We know they want to turn America into a police state where we're actual slaves of the government and the private interests that control it.
[00:39:26.631 --> 00:39:30.375]  We know that many of the leaders of our government are Satanists.
[00:39:31.232 --> 00:39:35.534]  Because they've written about it, they admit it, they engage in it, and we've made films about it.
[00:39:35.914 --> 00:39:40.576]  All that's hard to believe, folks, and I wish it wasn't true, but it is, and I'm here to report it to you.
[00:39:41.377 --> 00:39:47.759]  But that doesn't mean, then, that I run off the deep end and just believe everything because somebody said it.
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.000]  And I never will.
[00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:55.743]  But the interesting article that Dana brought up out of Wired Magazine that we did link to on Infowars.com.
[00:39:55.763 --> 00:39:57.684]  Dana, finish up telling folks about that.
[00:39:58.191 --> 00:40:11.238]  Well, if people would like to read these research articles, especially Dr. Ross Hoffman, all they have to do is a Google and do N-I-A-C and click that highlight on and it'll take them right to it.
[00:40:11.618 --> 00:40:14.940]  And there's a main page where you can go any direction and find out anything you want.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.303]  What I find encouraging is go to the funding list of all the things that are being worked on right now.
[00:40:20.703 --> 00:40:23.245]  It's very eye-opening, some of the stuff that's going on.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:36.085]  The other thing I would like to bring up is there is a DVD out called Bush Family Fortunes, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy.
[00:40:36.105 --> 00:40:41.667]  And that's very interesting because it approaches the oil concept of the war in Iraq.
[00:40:42.388 --> 00:40:49.031]  The acronym OIL stands for Organization and Liberation, I believe.
[00:40:49.711 --> 00:40:53.533]  Yeah, we've had the BBC reporter on to produce that.
[00:40:53.573 --> 00:40:54.333]  Thank you for the call.
[00:40:54.913 --> 00:40:56.034]  This is Greg Palast.
[00:40:56.946 --> 00:40:59.427]  Okay, I'm going to try to move a little bit quicker now to your calls.
[00:41:00.268 --> 00:41:03.009]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Canada.
[00:41:03.089 --> 00:41:03.890]  John, welcome.
[00:41:04.750 --> 00:41:05.210]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:41:05.490 --> 00:41:05.951]  Hi.
[00:41:06.211 --> 00:41:07.732]  It's John again here in Canada.
[00:41:07.752 --> 00:41:16.576]  I'm the guy who has been publicly demanding, essentially, the immediate arrest, public trial, and execution of those who truly committed 9-11.
[00:41:16.656 --> 00:41:23.920]  I've spoken to CSIS, which is the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, and I've met numerous times with the RCMP officials
[00:41:24.884 --> 00:41:26.685]  Uh, National Security Branch.
[00:41:27.705 --> 00:41:32.547]  Nobody finds fault with my allegations because they stand irrespective of my opinion.
[00:41:32.587 --> 00:41:34.268]  So I'm not asking for people's faith.
[00:41:34.808 --> 00:41:41.630]  I'm asking Americans to stand up as men and demand the arrest of these monsters, demons, whatever you want to call them.
[00:41:41.890 --> 00:41:52.614]  You know, you were saying earlier, you know, that the political elite in America, they're really partners in crime and it's all a big charade.
[00:41:52.955 --> 00:41:53.555]  It's theatrics.
[00:41:54.838 --> 00:41:57.779]  And I'm totally in agreement with you on that.
[00:41:57.799 --> 00:42:00.199]  But understand, I don't mean that figuratively.
[00:42:00.279 --> 00:42:02.239]  I mean, it's actually scripted.
[00:42:02.259 --> 00:42:06.860]  They're behind closed doors, you know, eating beluga caviar, literally.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:07.640]  Oh, for sure.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:12.641]  And Hillary, Murdoch, the Bushes, all of them, and then they go out in public and have fights.
[00:42:12.761 --> 00:42:14.281]  I mean, it's the equivalent.
[00:42:14.721 --> 00:42:15.021]  Oh, yeah.
[00:42:15.062 --> 00:42:17.542]  It is equal to professional wrestling.
[00:42:17.742 --> 00:42:18.862]  Totally fake.
[00:42:19.162 --> 00:42:19.782]  Yeah.
[00:42:20.062 --> 00:42:23.623]  Well, especially the evidence that is available...
[00:42:24.076 --> 00:42:24.496]  No, it's not.
[00:42:39.782 --> 00:42:40.202]  Well, no.
[00:42:40.242 --> 00:42:40.803]  Okay, I know.
[00:42:40.843 --> 00:42:42.704]  He definitely knew.
[00:42:43.084 --> 00:42:45.426]  Mr. Clinton definitely knew.
[00:42:45.606 --> 00:42:56.093]  That is designed to polarize and get Bush's approval points up by energizing Bush's faltering conservative base to have Clinton come out and play that little scam.
[00:42:56.333 --> 00:42:56.813]  Okay, right.
[00:42:56.833 --> 00:42:57.654]  There's no conning you.
[00:42:57.674 --> 00:42:59.115]  But I'm always in concern.
[00:42:59.917 --> 00:43:04.480]  Of why American men don't stand up and shout out loud, demanding the arrest.
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.301]  Well, American men do.
[00:43:06.361 --> 00:43:08.502]  They just don't have their own media, so you don't hear them.
[00:43:08.862 --> 00:43:10.002]  Well, that's the thing.
[00:43:10.083 --> 00:43:26.111]  And that's the point I was going to get across, is that about a year or two almost ago, you know, I spend a huge amount of time, I'm fairly proficient with telephone numbers, and I was able to contact just about every single employee at CBC and just made them well aware.
[00:43:26.584 --> 00:43:27.084]  I understand.
[00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:27.985]  Thanks for the call.
[00:43:28.005 --> 00:43:31.168]  Now the CBC has done reports about the Bushes and the Bin Ladens and
[00:43:52.623 --> 00:43:59.305]  Being ready to go to war with Afghanistan two days before, and Bush having the specifics of what Al-Shigaya was planning.
[00:43:59.325 --> 00:44:01.806]  I mean, no kidding he got the briefing.
[00:44:02.046 --> 00:44:04.987]  The people that control Bush were behind the attacks, folks.
[00:44:05.588 --> 00:44:06.848]  I mean, it's all a big joke.
[00:44:07.688 --> 00:44:09.469]  Unless you're the dead people in those towers.
[00:44:09.849 --> 00:44:12.270]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Texas.
[00:44:12.350 --> 00:44:13.130]  Richard, welcome.
[00:44:13.891 --> 00:44:14.431]  Hello, Alex.
[00:44:14.611 --> 00:44:14.891]  Hi.
[00:44:15.451 --> 00:44:20.253]  Hey, like you, I haven't been watching a whole lot of TV, but with all this hurricane activity, it kind of pulled me back in and
[00:44:20.771 --> 00:44:31.920]  I was channel surfing Saturday and stopped on C-SPAN right when Ted Stevens, the senator from Alaska, started this disaster prevention and prediction hearing.
[00:44:32.641 --> 00:44:36.764]  He's the chairman of the US Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
[00:44:37.485 --> 00:44:39.426]  And I'd like to read one quote.
[00:44:39.627 --> 00:44:40.327]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:44:40.888 --> 00:44:41.488]  Just one sentence.
[00:44:41.989 --> 00:44:44.771]  You know, I've got to be a little bit provincial myself.
[00:44:45.311 --> 00:44:49.695]  One of the reasons I decided we should have a subcommittee dealing with disaster prediction and prevention
[00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:58.137]  Was that the first typhoon in the Arctic that we know of in 2003, it almost touched Point Barrow.
[00:44:58.918 --> 00:45:06.444]  Now, that's the first typhoon, Arctic typhoon, in 2003, northwest of Alaska.
[00:45:06.965 --> 00:45:09.767]  Now, that just happens to be in the same state that HAARP is in.
[00:45:10.568 --> 00:45:15.152]  And, of course, typhoons are supposedly only forming over warm waters.
[00:45:16.071 --> 00:45:16.531]  Exactly.
[00:45:16.811 --> 00:45:19.412]  In more tropical regions.
[00:45:20.033 --> 00:45:24.955]  And, you know, HAARP, the biggest weather control array that we know of, is up in Alaska.
[00:45:25.675 --> 00:45:25.895]  Right.
[00:45:25.995 --> 00:45:36.039]  So it's very interesting that as soon as I got off TV, I went to the Internet to look up any news articles or news stories about this typhoon in 2003.
[00:45:36.699 --> 00:45:38.400]  I couldn't find one news report.
[00:45:38.580 --> 00:45:42.962]  Now, I guess I'm not that good of an Internet searcher, but maybe somebody else can find some news reports.
[00:45:43.122 --> 00:45:45.383]  But as far as I know, this is the only report of it.
[00:45:45.754 --> 00:45:51.899]  And he did hold up a photocopy satellite image of that typhoon northwest of Alaska.
[00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:55.282]  Well, I remember the report.
[00:45:57.163 --> 00:45:59.685]  Well, this was just on the 20th that they had this hearing.
[00:46:00.886 --> 00:46:07.452]  And if you type into Google, Arctic Typhoon Point Barrow Ted Stevens, it pops up as the first link.
[00:46:07.532 --> 00:46:12.776]  There is a transcript there of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee meeting.
[00:46:12.876 --> 00:46:15.318]  What were the things going on, Richard?
[00:46:16.024 --> 00:46:18.165]  Well, I just think it's a piece of evidence.
[00:46:18.425 --> 00:46:29.450]  You know, I mean, we've never heard or known of an Arctic typhoon, and we know these guys are playing around with this because I found one... Well, I just think if we accept the global tax, everything will be okay.
[00:46:29.770 --> 00:46:30.370]  That's right.
[00:46:30.390 --> 00:46:32.752]  Just accept the handcuffs and chains right away.
[00:46:32.872 --> 00:46:36.353]  But I also found a great link on your website that people should read.
[00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:38.374]  It's Owning the Weather in 2025.
[00:46:39.034 --> 00:46:41.295]  It's Weather as a Force Multiplier.
[00:46:41.435 --> 00:46:42.536]  Yeah, that's another Pentagon...
[00:46:43.214 --> 00:46:45.837]  Hey, Richard, let me ask you a question.
[00:46:45.877 --> 00:46:58.909]  What do you think of all the news coming out of the mastermind bomber in England confirmed MI6 agent and then catching the British SAS dressed up as Arabs carrying out terror attacks?
[00:46:59.769 --> 00:47:03.413]  Well, it's just a typical New World Order modus operandi, right?
[00:47:03.473 --> 00:47:04.454]  That's their fingerprint.
[00:47:05.475 --> 00:47:07.577]  But, I mean, Richard, how can people not get it?
[00:47:07.657 --> 00:47:07.877]  I mean...
[00:47:08.793 --> 00:47:12.736]  Do the globalists make more money if they're in Iraq ten years and things are going bad?
[00:47:12.756 --> 00:47:16.038]  Or do they make more money if things go well and we're there six months?
[00:47:16.759 --> 00:47:18.820]  Well, they'll make more money if they're in there forever, right?
[00:47:19.801 --> 00:47:20.321]  Exactly.
[00:47:20.621 --> 00:47:24.244]  So we have to start understanding the goals they tell us about are a fraud.
[00:47:25.204 --> 00:47:26.665]  We have to go to the motive, don't we?
[00:47:27.766 --> 00:47:27.986]  Right.
[00:47:28.146 --> 00:47:32.109]  And, well, we know what their motive is, those of us that have studied it like you, so...
[00:47:32.915 --> 00:47:39.180]  But going back to this weather thing for just a second, I was looking up some information about Bernard J. Eastland.
[00:47:40.301 --> 00:47:43.004]  He's the father of HAARP.
[00:47:43.964 --> 00:47:47.968]  And I was looking at his website, Eastland Scientific Enterprises Corporation.
[00:47:48.608 --> 00:47:55.995]  And right on the, if you click on the About the Company link, right on here, it says Environmental Systems, Tornado Modification.
[00:47:58.163 --> 00:47:59.483]  Anyway, he might be an interesting guest.
[00:48:00.043 --> 00:48:01.944]  Be sure and send me that link, Richard.
[00:48:01.984 --> 00:48:02.804]  I was aware of that.
[00:48:03.544 --> 00:48:10.826]  Yes, the inventor and the guy that sold the system to the Pentagon, he'll control the weather for you, but it doesn't exist.
[00:48:11.386 --> 00:48:11.866]  There you go.
[00:48:12.046 --> 00:48:12.446]  That's it.
[00:48:12.847 --> 00:48:13.987]  Hey, one last thing.
[00:48:14.547 --> 00:48:22.869]  Did you see or hear about Bush and San Antonio talking about, hey, at what point should we bring it in the military whenever we have these types of events?
[00:48:23.431 --> 00:48:34.298]  I actually heard him on the radio say it, and the same day, two days in a row, Scott McClellan, White House Press Secretary, said, security is the number one problem in places like New Orleans.
[00:48:34.718 --> 00:48:37.300]  We need troops to be able to engage in law enforcement.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:40.041]  Folks, they're trained to kill people and break things.
[00:48:40.141 --> 00:48:41.943]  The military is to defend the country.
[00:48:42.263 --> 00:48:47.206]  When your domestic military begins policing you, that's called martial law.
[00:48:48.346 --> 00:48:54.308]  And they're openly wanting to, quote, get rid of it so Caesar can bring his troops into Rome.
[00:48:54.708 --> 00:48:56.969]  They call that crossing the Rubicon.
[00:48:57.989 --> 00:49:01.630]  And you want to live in Nazi Germany, folks, you're a few inches away from it.
[00:49:02.250 --> 00:49:05.351]  The troops are allowed to bring food, aid, and defend themselves.
[00:49:05.411 --> 00:49:13.594]  There was no need to, quote, have troops engaging in law enforcement for a few hundred looters who might have been resisting.
[00:49:13.634 --> 00:49:14.174]  The police...
[00:49:14.881 --> 00:49:15.781]  Could have dealt with that.
[00:49:15.801 --> 00:49:16.621]  That's their job.
[00:49:16.661 --> 00:49:17.101]  No, no, no.
[00:49:17.382 --> 00:49:24.743]  They order the police to stand down, again, create a bigger crisis, then call in the military and say, oops, their hands are tied.
[00:49:25.363 --> 00:49:33.685]  And by the way, the military was armed, and they were firing their weapons, and so were Blackwater and Titan Security and ISI and all of it.
[00:49:34.345 --> 00:49:35.845]  And it's just a nightmare.
[00:49:35.925 --> 00:49:37.286]  And, yeah, that's coming up, Richard.
[00:49:37.326 --> 00:49:38.046]  I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:49:38.066 --> 00:49:38.566]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:39.935 --> 00:49:40.596]  Good to hear from you.
[00:49:40.896 --> 00:49:41.777]  Steve in Texas.
[00:49:41.797 --> 00:49:42.577]  Steve, go ahead.
[00:49:42.597 --> 00:49:42.938]  Welcome.
[00:49:43.438 --> 00:49:44.359]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:54.247]  Just wanted to tell you that there's going to be a pro-Minuteman rally at the Capitol in Austin this coming Saturday, October 1st at about 10.30.
[00:49:55.868 --> 00:50:03.094]  And it's going to be, as put on by a variety of groups, it's going to be an Enforce Our Borders rally sort of thing.
[00:50:03.154 --> 00:50:07.878]  It's going to be being sponsored by Jeff Wentworth.
[00:50:08.823 --> 00:50:14.205]  The Senator, Young Conservatives of Texas, the Republican Liberty Caucus, the Minutemen, and some others.
[00:50:14.866 --> 00:50:15.606]  Well, that's good.
[00:50:15.646 --> 00:50:17.026]  I'll be unable to make it to that.
[00:50:17.046 --> 00:50:19.888]  I already had a prior engagement, but I'll certainly promote it, Steve.
[00:50:20.468 --> 00:50:20.668]  Yep.
[00:50:20.768 --> 00:50:22.569]  The more people we can get to show up, the better.
[00:50:23.249 --> 00:50:37.255]  Also, for people in Austin, the Quakers have gotten a proposal against the Minutemen approved by the Austin Commission on Immigrant Affairs that they're going to bring up, trying to disinvite the Minutemen from coming to Austin.
[00:50:38.146 --> 00:50:44.230]  Yeah, and I think sometimes people ought to turn out to speak out against that.
[00:50:45.831 --> 00:50:46.811]  All right, my friend.
[00:50:46.952 --> 00:50:48.352]  Thanks for the info.
[00:50:48.532 --> 00:50:49.733]  When's it coming up for a vote?
[00:50:50.374 --> 00:50:51.354]  I don't know.
[00:50:51.454 --> 00:50:53.015]  I'll call you and let you know about that.
[00:50:53.295 --> 00:50:53.996]  All right, thanks.

[00:54:24.690 --> 00:54:28.333]  Federal court said, knock it off, stop the gun confiscation.
[00:54:28.513 --> 00:54:33.116]  And, of course, most of the general public were still in denial that gun confiscation was going on.
[00:54:35.009 --> 00:54:36.570]  Of course, all federally directed.
[00:54:37.110 --> 00:54:39.992]  Bill would permit DNA collection from all those arrested.

[00:55:30.138 --> 00:55:30.578]  The U.S.
[00:55:30.658 --> 00:55:33.399]  Army plans to bulk buy Anthrax.
[00:55:34.204 --> 00:55:36.306]  New scientists reporting that.
[00:55:37.947 --> 00:55:40.549]  And diverse anti-war protests, largest in D.C.
[00:55:40.589 --> 00:55:44.412]  since Vietnam, and arrests were made in New York and D.C.
[00:55:44.452 --> 00:55:46.353]  of peaceful people.
[00:55:47.354 --> 00:55:51.357]  A Navy secretly contracted jets used by CIA for torture.
[00:55:52.158 --> 00:55:53.559]  That's a new American virtue.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:56.681]  And new accounts of torture by U.S.
[00:55:56.721 --> 00:55:58.623]  troops even more gruesome.
[00:55:59.423 --> 00:56:04.265]  Fingerprint ID schemes for schools, enrolling your children in the biometric systems.
[00:56:04.825 --> 00:56:06.706]  It's all coming up.
[00:56:07.946 --> 00:56:15.709]  But before we go back to your calls and into all that news I just mentioned, the holidays are coming up.
[00:56:15.869 --> 00:56:17.250]  Why procrastinate?
[00:56:17.370 --> 00:56:23.853]  Why buy your family junk that they won't eat, like a fruitcake or some ugly tie?
[00:56:24.573 --> 00:56:25.873]  Why fight the crowds?
[00:56:26.274 --> 00:56:27.214]  Why not now?
[00:56:28.229 --> 00:56:33.752]  Order American Dictators, or Roads of Tyranny, or Masters of Terror, or Martial Law, my new film.
[00:56:34.992 --> 00:56:39.334]  If you buy three copies of any of my videos, you get an $18 discount.
[00:56:39.934 --> 00:56:47.998]  We've got some specials where you buy one American Dictator DVD, an incredible film exposing the false left-right paradigm, a very important film.
[00:56:49.098 --> 00:56:51.279]  Gets into Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, and a lot more.
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:54.561]  Buy one copy for $19.95.
[00:56:55.081 --> 00:56:56.822]  Each additional copy is only...
[00:56:58.045 --> 00:57:01.867]  $5.95 apiece, so be sure and take advantage of those.
[00:57:04.649 --> 00:57:07.651]  You can also call toll-free to get any of the films.
[00:57:07.671 --> 00:57:11.113]  1-888-253-3139 Or buy one copy of, say, Martial Law, my new film.
[00:57:19.275 --> 00:57:19.776]  We're good to go.
[00:57:42.228 --> 00:57:46.689]  People tend to watch it more readily, too, if it's got the Hollywood-style cover.
[00:57:47.209 --> 00:57:48.349]  So I recommend you do that.
[00:57:48.389 --> 00:57:49.389]  It makes a great gift.
[00:57:50.249 --> 00:57:52.450]  And give them their gift early this year.
[00:57:52.510 --> 00:57:53.410]  We don't have time.
[00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:54.570]  We've got to expose this.
[00:57:55.150 --> 00:57:57.571]  We can't wait a month or two to give people this stuff.
[00:57:57.591 --> 00:58:00.491]  You need to give it to them now and say, here's your present early.
[00:58:00.951 --> 00:58:02.092]  Watch this and wake up.
[00:58:04.032 --> 00:58:05.112]  It's so important.
[00:58:05.192 --> 00:58:10.173]  Go to InfoWars.com and order films via the safe, secure online shopping cart.

[00:58:57.765 --> 00:58:58.385]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.066 --> 00:59:00.126]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.847 --> 00:59:02.028]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.608 --> 00:59:03.428]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.169 --> 00:59:05.009]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.750 --> 00:59:09.672]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.932 --> 00:59:14.055]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.495 --> 00:59:17.797]  Big victory for the Second Amendment.
[00:59:18.317 --> 00:59:19.518]  Big, big victory.
[00:59:19.558 --> 00:59:20.959]  We're really excited about this.
[00:59:21.439 --> 00:59:23.060]  Tell you about it coming up in the next segment.
[00:59:23.954 --> 00:59:25.194]  More examples of U.S.
[00:59:25.234 --> 00:59:33.096]  government troops and other troops being caught carrying out terror attacks to blame it on foreign enemies and to keep Iraq stirred up so defense contractors can make more money.
[00:59:33.876 --> 00:59:36.037]  There's a ton of news coming up in this hour.
[00:59:36.077 --> 00:59:40.538]  Right now, let's go to Robert in Colorado, then Rodney in Texas and others.
[00:59:40.578 --> 00:59:41.218]  Go ahead, Robert.
[00:59:43.419 --> 00:59:44.359]  Good morning, Alexander.
[00:59:44.379 --> 00:59:45.219]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:59:45.239 --> 00:59:45.979]  I appreciate that.
[00:59:45.999 --> 00:59:48.000]  A couple of quick points.
[00:59:49.017 --> 00:59:49.657]  A quick question.
[00:59:49.717 --> 00:59:52.981]  Number one, a little off-topic, or no topic is off-topic for you.
[00:59:53.001 --> 00:59:53.902]  I know I appreciate that.
[00:59:55.144 --> 01:00:03.614]  As you know, the United States and President Bush did not go along, one of the few countries that did not go along with the Kyoto Protocol Treaty,
[01:00:04.878 --> 01:00:09.219]  I thought it was essentially set up to stop global warming.
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:11.260]  Total fraud.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:15.861]  You sell and trade energy credits, and it's a global tax on all energy use.
[01:00:16.461 --> 01:00:25.263]  And Bush just did that because it would be political suicide here, though he is still voluntarily going along with the Kyoto Protocol.
[01:00:25.303 --> 01:00:27.624]  Now they're saying, oh, you didn't go along with it.
[01:00:27.644 --> 01:00:28.984]  You've caused these hurricanes.
[01:00:29.801 --> 01:00:30.561]  So it is a scam then?
[01:00:30.581 --> 01:00:31.081]  It is a total fraud.
[01:00:57.265 --> 01:00:58.346]  Okay, that went right over my head.
[01:00:58.366 --> 01:01:02.149]  I thought it was a good thing, but you're saying it just would have been global tax.
[01:01:02.370 --> 01:01:04.091]  Yeah, they just want to tax on all energy.
[01:01:04.732 --> 01:01:05.492]  Okay.
[01:01:05.913 --> 01:01:13.840]  And I read that lengthy article on your website, nifflowars.com, about the friendly fire killing of...
[01:01:15.134 --> 01:01:17.696]  That thing has more layers than even I figured.
[01:01:17.756 --> 01:01:35.069]  The article, as you know, I'm just going over, you know, we hash here, said that the lieutenant, the platoon commander, didn't want them to break up the unit because that would have been dangerous in enemy territory, but he was overruled by his superiors, and that kind of led to the doubt, you know, to the bad situation as well.
[01:01:35.629 --> 01:01:42.975]  And then the lieutenant colonel got to not only not say that the lieutenant platoon
[01:01:43.729 --> 01:01:47.131]  Well, I mean, Jessica Lynch said she wouldn't lie for them, that it was all a fable.
[01:01:47.211 --> 01:01:48.011]  The Tillmans won't lie.
[01:01:48.051 --> 01:01:52.974]  The point is, folks, they lie to you, and in drooling and giggling about it, doesn't make it okay.
[01:01:53.014 --> 01:01:53.714]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:12.399 --> 01:02:17.362]  I mean, people just so... Well, folks, that's a big deal.
[01:02:18.043 --> 01:02:19.024]  Rodney in Texas.
[01:02:19.044 --> 01:02:19.724]  Go ahead, Rodney.
[01:02:20.004 --> 01:02:20.885]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:21.105]  Good.
[01:02:21.865 --> 01:02:24.287]  Hey, first of all, I just want to be clear.
[01:02:24.387 --> 01:02:26.688]  Pat Tillman, that was not friendly fire.
[01:02:26.729 --> 01:02:27.389]  He was murdered.
[01:02:28.149 --> 01:02:28.450]  Okay?
[01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:35.975]  Just straight out, and I know that might sound a little harsh to people, but all the evidence points to the man was actually murdered.
[01:02:36.015 --> 01:02:36.235]  He was...
[01:02:38.214 --> 01:02:45.899]  For lack of a better expression, a sacrificial lamb to keep this phony war on terrorism going into phony patriotism.
[01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:54.405]  Now, there was another story that I shared with Rick Barber out of Denver, KOA.
[01:02:55.086 --> 01:02:57.067]  And he was very, very, very surprised.
[01:02:57.087 --> 01:03:03.132]  And the reason why I shared it with him is because I got the information from your website.
[01:03:03.212 --> 01:03:06.174]  His producer was a little skeptical because it came from
[01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:10.341]  I didn't see the St.
[01:03:10.381 --> 01:03:11.622]  Paul Pioneer Press.
[01:03:12.282 --> 01:03:14.663]  Will you email that to me?
[01:03:14.803 --> 01:03:17.625]  Stay there, Rodney.
[01:03:18.385 --> 01:03:20.986]  I'll let you read the article to us.
[01:03:21.066 --> 01:03:21.286]  We'll...
[01:03:36.092 --> 01:03:36.913]  We'll come right back.
[01:03:36.993 --> 01:03:39.616]  I mean, they caught them carrying out attacks.
[01:03:39.696 --> 01:03:41.859]  I mean, it's not... It's been in the BBC.
[01:03:41.879 --> 01:03:46.104]  I mean, what are they... That's how the defense contractors make more money.
[01:03:46.504 --> 01:03:48.287]  Not to let the war go on longer.
[01:03:48.307 --> 01:03:49.108]  I mean, it's simple.
[01:03:49.128 --> 01:03:50.850]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:51.851]  Stay with us.
[01:03:54.528 --> 01:03:57.369]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.629 --> 01:03:59.230]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.550 --> 01:04:04.233]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.573 --> 01:04:08.995]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.415 --> 01:04:13.597]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.817 --> 01:04:16.658]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:16.758 --> 01:04:21.420]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.621 --> 01:04:26.043]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:33.486]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.746 --> 01:04:36.167]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:55.655 --> 01:05:59.037]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:05:59.277 --> 01:05:59.617]  Why?
[01:05:59.957 --> 01:06:02.578]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[01:06:53.628 --> 01:06:55.809]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:56.369 --> 01:06:59.229]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:08.751 --> 01:07:16.573]  Folks, I'm somebody who, at least for most of my life, has, you know, never gets sick.
[01:07:16.893 --> 01:07:20.774]  And I still, I don't get the flu, I don't get colds, I don't get that.
[01:07:20.814 --> 01:07:22.174]  What I get is allergies.
[01:07:23.587 --> 01:07:26.209]  And I guess I've got to shoot some more of this Zycam up my nose.
[01:07:26.249 --> 01:07:27.750]  That tends to help.
[01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:34.254]  But the reason I'm talking about this is I'm not the only one here in Austin, Texas.
[01:07:35.054 --> 01:07:38.216]  It was 104 degrees yesterday.
[01:07:40.358 --> 01:07:41.799]  104 degrees.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:49.984]  And the Weather Bug is a service online that shows these different thermometers all over the country.
[01:07:50.004 --> 01:07:53.026]  There are about 15 different ones in Austin.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:08:06.586]  And I clicked on the weather bug for the school of the deaf that is pretty close to my house, and it said 105 yesterday at about 6 o'clock.
[01:08:07.447 --> 01:08:08.687]  Why am I telling this story?
[01:08:09.368 --> 01:08:20.133]  Well, just if I sound a little different today, it's because I literally, my ears are popping and my nose is popping, and it feels like I'm talking through about two feet of water.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:28.303]  But everybody I know, people who've never had allergies, are like wheezing and coughing and noses running.
[01:08:29.323 --> 01:08:31.664]  The hurricane like blew in this dust.
[01:08:31.684 --> 01:08:34.025]  You could see it last night, this big red sunset.
[01:08:35.165 --> 01:08:36.926]  I drove over the river last night at sunset.
[01:08:36.946 --> 01:08:38.567]  There was all this dust over the river.
[01:08:39.067 --> 01:08:41.028]  It was really weird.
[01:08:41.288 --> 01:08:44.669]  And 104 degrees three days into fall.
[01:08:44.749 --> 01:08:47.070]  I mean, folks, it gets hot here, but not 100.
[01:08:47.130 --> 01:08:49.331]  I mean, every day is a new record.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:09:01.347]  The temp yesterday was 104 registered by the government and by the media, but I looked at thermometers online, and 105 just when I happened to look at it.
[01:09:02.268 --> 01:09:13.215]  And there's something in the air, and supposedly a bunch of Chihuahuan desert dust got blown up here, but why would that make everybody be basically keeling over?
[01:09:14.636 --> 01:09:19.219]  Again, I never had allergies, folks, and now the last few years they get worse and worse,
[01:09:21.155 --> 01:09:24.036]  Four degrees, 105 degrees if you look at the other thermometer.
[01:09:24.657 --> 01:09:28.158]  And I'm sitting here hacking and coughing.
[01:09:28.198 --> 01:09:32.460]  It makes me want to move out of Austin, folks.
[01:09:33.681 --> 01:09:35.882]  But I hear allergies are on the rise nationwide.
[01:09:35.922 --> 01:09:37.723]  Though we are the capital of these things.
[01:09:37.743 --> 01:09:40.424]  This is just such a new experience for me.
[01:09:40.464 --> 01:09:43.506]  I guess I say having your health is everything.
[01:09:44.526 --> 01:09:46.187]  And having your health really is everything.
[01:09:46.207 --> 01:09:47.047]  I mean, I've got my health.
[01:09:47.107 --> 01:09:48.008]  It's just annoying.
[01:09:48.028 --> 01:09:50.229]  I mean, it's really annoying to...
[01:09:50.948 --> 01:09:53.069]  I have a runny nose all the time and a headache.
[01:09:55.390 --> 01:10:02.093]  In fact, I'm so unaccustomed to having illnesses or irritants that I haven't taken anything yet today.
[01:10:02.773 --> 01:10:03.434]  I should have.
[01:10:03.494 --> 01:10:07.576]  It's just such a weird habit to have to take something every morning when you get up.
[01:10:08.376 --> 01:10:10.157]  Is the whole city going to have to do this?
[01:10:10.437 --> 01:10:12.718]  Literally everybody I know is sick right now.
[01:10:13.405 --> 01:10:14.386]  What is in the air?
[01:10:14.506 --> 01:10:18.809]  I mean, I don't want to get off into that being a conspiracy, but we know they've sprayed stuff on us before.
[01:10:18.849 --> 01:10:20.851]  They admit it, so why shouldn't we say they're doing it again?
[01:10:22.953 --> 01:10:24.754]  Why is it 104 degrees here?
[01:10:25.374 --> 01:10:26.916]  Some areas in the world are colder.
[01:10:26.976 --> 01:10:30.438]  Other areas are unseasonably or record temperatures of heat.
[01:10:31.719 --> 01:10:32.960]  All right, I digress.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.523]  We're talking to Rodney in Texas, and he's saying the St.
[01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:39.726]  Paul Pioneer Press, a paper I'm very aware of.
[01:10:39.766 --> 01:10:42.308]  In fact, our network is based in St.
[01:10:42.348 --> 01:10:42.528]  Paul.
[01:10:43.494 --> 01:10:47.655]  Perhaps you guys have got a Sunday edition of this there at the network.
[01:10:47.715 --> 01:11:06.999]  I haven't seen it yet, but it has been in the BBC and the London Independent and a few other publications that these MI6-type military individuals, SAS is assigned to MI6, the precursor of our Delta Force, was caught carrying out
[01:11:07.739 --> 01:11:08.520]  Terror attacks.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:18.707]  Caught shooting police, dressed as Arabs, in Basra, the British-controlled zone, with the British-installed governor, and then posing as Arabs with a truck full of bombs.
[01:11:18.727 --> 01:11:22.150]  And that has been in the news.
[01:11:22.270 --> 01:11:29.896]  And then Rodney was saying he called a talk show host, a good talk show host, I've been on his show many times, that the producer was skeptical.
[01:11:31.016 --> 01:11:33.198]  They asked me to go on a few months ago, and I was just too tired.
[01:11:33.238 --> 01:11:34.099]  It's an overnight show.
[01:11:34.159 --> 01:11:34.859]  I just said no.
[01:11:35.199 --> 01:11:36.240]  I hope they're not irritated with me.
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:37.161]  I need to go back on there.
[01:11:37.867 --> 01:11:45.209]  But, uh... But, uh... They, uh... You know, we're questioning this report.
[01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:52.151]  Rodney, go ahead and finish your story and tell us what happened when you called him back with a Pioneer Press article.
[01:11:52.671 --> 01:11:56.432]  Well, like I said, Alex, the guy was skeptical.
[01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:59.572]  The producer, not the actual talk show host.
[01:11:59.612 --> 01:12:01.593]  That's Rick Barber.
[01:12:02.133 --> 01:12:04.914]  He basically believes anything that's factual.
[01:12:05.814 --> 01:12:06.194]  And, uh...
[01:12:06.727 --> 01:12:09.449]  Most people who listen to your show know that you're very factual.
[01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:13.532]  Well, I don't blame them for being skeptical.
[01:12:13.612 --> 01:12:14.353]  It's healthy.
[01:12:14.813 --> 01:12:18.916]  Well, but here's the thing that I pointed out to the producer.
[01:12:19.776 --> 01:12:28.603]  Curiously enough, one of the reasons why Basra and the citizens over there are in an uproar is because the St.
[01:12:28.643 --> 01:12:35.588]  Paul Pioneer Press reported that Paul Brimmer passed an ordinance before he resigned his position over there.
[01:12:36.109 --> 01:12:43.994]  Granting immunity to British, American, and I guess any other multinational force unit.
[01:12:44.955 --> 01:12:47.837]  Granting them immunity from prosecution.
[01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:55.722]  So, I mean, this is basically like order out of chaos.
[01:12:55.762 --> 01:13:04.288]  Well, for those that don't understand this, for those that haven't figured it out yet, in Vietnam, if the troops raped a little girl, they went to jail.
[01:13:05.060 --> 01:13:09.401]  In Vietnam, they executed people just randomly.
[01:13:09.601 --> 01:13:12.382]  They went to prison, or they at least got dishonorably discharged.
[01:13:12.982 --> 01:13:17.523]  Now, Operation Phoenix type stuff, in fact, there are war vets now giving speeches.
[01:13:18.004 --> 01:13:19.064]  We've had them on this show.
[01:13:19.504 --> 01:13:25.345]  There are war vets now giving speeches, and this is what the media is trying to black out, where they were told, just kill every taxi driver.
[01:13:25.846 --> 01:13:28.486]  We think people are carrying bombs in taxis, so just kill.
[01:13:28.846 --> 01:13:30.847]  And so randomly, they would just kill everyone.
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.181]  I mean, this is the type of horror.
[01:13:33.921 --> 01:13:45.166]  There have been London independent reporters there where our troops are laughing and going, placing bets on, okay, with their .50 caliber rifles, all right, see that woman 5,000 yards away?
[01:13:45.206 --> 01:13:46.447]  I'm going to blow her head off.
[01:13:46.867 --> 01:13:49.348]  And then go and look at that bleeping bleeper's head.
[01:13:49.828 --> 01:13:54.771]  You know, just splattering some woman's head as if she's literally walking with her five-year-old.
[01:13:54.811 --> 01:13:59.893]  Imagine you're walking with your mother, and all of a sudden the head just vaporizes into a plume of jelly.
[01:14:00.453 --> 01:14:10.137]  And then the troops are just rolling around laughing, and it's all over in mainstream news how they take gruesome photos of dead people and sell those for porn.
[01:14:10.157 --> 01:14:13.438]  I mean, you talk about demonic pig people.
[01:14:14.178 --> 01:14:16.879]  I mean, this is as evil as it gets, folks.
[01:14:16.919 --> 01:14:27.703]  And I'm sorry, splattering innocent women's heads for pleasure, raping children, torturing people, beating them to death, gobbling, cutting their organs out like a bunch of goblins.
[01:14:28.343 --> 01:14:31.425]  This is all admitted, and this, again, is done by design.
[01:14:31.465 --> 01:14:32.626]  It's NP2OG.
[01:14:33.066 --> 01:14:39.010]  They said, we want to be brutal to make the Arabs fight back and actually create insurgency.
[01:14:39.410 --> 01:14:44.493]  That will then widen the conflict and be an excuse to stay, a pretext to stay in the region.
[01:14:45.177 --> 01:15:00.233]  And then we wonder why they catch Israelis twice shooting and rocketing Marine Corps bases, and then the Marines sneak up behind them, beat them up, pull their fake beards off, pull their clothes off, and they're Israelis with a huge Star of Davids on their arms.
[01:15:01.014 --> 01:15:05.399]  And it's the same thing with these SAS running around with the big fake beards, doing the same thing.
[01:15:05.739 --> 01:15:07.121]  We've caught our own troops doing it.
[01:15:07.742 --> 01:15:09.784]  And, you know, I'm against killing the troops, folks.
[01:15:09.844 --> 01:15:14.507]  So I know supporting the troops means killing them, but, you know, this is the sickness.
[01:15:14.567 --> 01:15:16.649]  And we know our own government did this in Vietnam.
[01:15:17.670 --> 01:15:19.151]  And I'm sick of it, Rodney.
[01:15:19.671 --> 01:15:22.133]  So I haven't seen the Pioneer Press.
[01:15:22.173 --> 01:15:23.554]  What did they specifically say about it?
[01:15:24.495 --> 01:15:28.558]  Well, like I said, I think you kind of hit the nail on the head.
[01:15:28.818 --> 01:15:34.983]  These troops, British, American, and Israelis, they have no fear of prosecutions.
[01:15:35.359 --> 01:15:53.090]  I mean, if you tell a guy, hey, you can go out and kill anything and everything walking around as human, and lately they've been even doing this to newspaper reporters, why should they fear... No, I hear you, but what specifically did the article say in the Pioneer Press?
[01:15:53.610 --> 01:15:57.532]  Well, it said that they... It was very watered down, I'll be honest with you.
[01:15:57.552 --> 01:16:04.897]  It said that they were caught undercover and that there had been a subpoena sent out for their arrest.
[01:16:05.643 --> 01:16:21.691]  According to the article, the British authorities claim that because of this ordinance passed by Bremer, that they didn't feel that these soldiers were under the jurisdiction of the Iraq government.
[01:16:21.731 --> 01:16:23.292]  Alright, thanks for the call, Rodney.
[01:16:24.073 --> 01:16:31.376]  Look, when you read these BBC articles and the other articles, it's just hidden in plain view.
[01:16:31.536 --> 01:16:34.518]  90% of the article will talk about
[01:16:36.684 --> 01:16:41.487]  How there was a jailbreak and they sent ten tanks and two helicopters in to get them out.
[01:16:42.187 --> 01:16:47.790]  And then a minor footnote, oh, here's the fake beards and the machine guns and the bombs and stuff.
[01:16:49.971 --> 01:16:56.295]  The police chief says they were shooting police posing as terrorists, preparing to carry out bombings.
[01:16:58.756 --> 01:17:00.317]  And it's all, let's just glaze over that.
[01:17:00.417 --> 01:17:03.899]  Why are they dressed up like Arabs running around shooting people?
[01:17:06.434 --> 01:17:07.995]  Again, to keep stuff stirred up.
[01:17:12.298 --> 01:17:13.299]  It's just so evil.
[01:17:13.999 --> 01:17:16.361]  Let's go ahead and talk to Russ in West Virginia.
[01:17:16.401 --> 01:17:17.061]  Russ, welcome.
[01:17:18.642 --> 01:17:19.443]  Hi, Alex.
[01:17:19.783 --> 01:17:21.364]  My name is Les, Leslie.
[01:17:22.405 --> 01:17:23.726]  Okay, well, they told me Russ.
[01:17:24.006 --> 01:17:24.366]  I know.
[01:17:24.667 --> 01:17:26.448]  I don't understand.
[01:17:26.488 --> 01:17:27.869]  Listen, let's talk about that.
[01:17:27.889 --> 01:17:32.252]  We can talk about what your name is, we can talk about the issues, or we can talk about whatever you like, sir.
[01:17:32.272 --> 01:17:33.573]  I have something harder than that.
[01:17:33.653 --> 01:17:33.793]  No.
[01:17:34.946 --> 01:17:38.047]  And I want to thank you for what you're doing, and I'm behind you all the way.
[01:17:38.067 --> 01:17:45.670]  I'm your brother in Christ, and I'm a Korean veteran, and I retired from the Baltimore City Fire Department.
[01:17:46.270 --> 01:17:51.711]  So I've been through the mill a little bit, and I know these things are possible, but what I see now are demons.
[01:17:51.931 --> 01:17:57.633]  Demons are in control of these people, and we are fighting a spiritual warfare.
[01:17:58.233 --> 01:18:00.534]  And I advise you for what you're doing.
[01:18:00.574 --> 01:18:01.734]  I'm behind you all the way.
[01:18:04.215 --> 01:18:09.237]  I was searching... Give me a favor and talk right into your phone.
[01:18:09.457 --> 01:18:10.637]  Yeah.
[01:18:11.037 --> 01:18:29.664]  I was searching through the shortwave this morning before David Joyce came on power hour, and I heard a news report that Bush said that he was now deciding to put the armed services or the military over the chaotic situation.
[01:18:30.509 --> 01:18:33.871]  Yeah, I'm going to cover that in detail.
[01:18:33.911 --> 01:18:34.991]  Stay there, I'll let you finish up.
[01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:40.754]  And for those that don't know, I mean, we've told you always, they're going to get rid of Posse Comitatus.
[01:18:42.055 --> 01:18:44.396]  And that's the balloon going up, that's the shoe dropping.
[01:18:45.916 --> 01:18:46.957]  And he's doing it.
[01:18:47.677 --> 01:18:48.878]  So we'll detail it.
[01:18:49.178 --> 01:18:50.118]  You want to be a slave?
[01:18:50.138 --> 01:18:51.299]  You're going to get to be one, folks.
[01:18:53.911 --> 01:19:00.137]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water, but without oxygen you would be dead in minutes.
[01:19:00.657 --> 01:19:02.759]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:06.483]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[01:19:06.723 --> 01:19:10.487]  Conversely, where oxygen is deficient, disease thrives.
[01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:17.053]  With atmospheric oxygen levels commonly dipping as low as 10% in today's indoor and urban environments,
[01:19:17.393 --> 01:19:20.315]  Is it any wonder we have so much chronic disease to deal with?
[01:19:20.495 --> 01:19:23.797]  Most of us are oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[01:19:24.037 --> 01:19:28.659]  Without sufficient oxygen, both our physical and mental health will deteriorate.
[01:19:28.979 --> 01:19:36.483]  Clearly, increasing the body's oxygen without negative side effects is critical to achieving good health and a sense of well-being.
[01:19:36.663 --> 01:19:43.367]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and all health-minded individuals.

[01:20:46.804 --> 01:20:48.245]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:20:48.385 --> 01:20:51.746]  Or order online at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:20:51.766 --> 01:20:55.527]  Currency, devaluation, inflation.
[01:20:55.607 --> 01:20:56.267]  One and the same.
[01:20:56.347 --> 01:20:58.268]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%,
[01:21:07.788 --> 01:21:13.251]  In a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:13.692 --> 01:21:16.814]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:17.074 --> 01:21:18.915]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:18.995 --> 01:21:22.417]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:22.677 --> 01:21:24.758]  Here is reality.
[01:21:25.139 --> 01:21:28.701]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:29.201 --> 01:21:32.863]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:33.424 --> 01:21:35.845]  Gold, in the same time frame, increased 35% in value.
[01:21:37.583 --> 01:21:37.844]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:55.217 --> 01:21:58.660]  Government is best which governs the... Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:01.822]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:22:02.263 --> 01:22:04.925]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:22:05.345 --> 01:22:11.830]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:22:21.838 --> 01:22:22.898]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[01:22:24.359 --> 01:22:26.560]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:22:45.359 --> 01:22:46.380]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:48.180]  Osama been forgotten.

[01:22:52.282 --> 01:23:04.148]  All right, Les, Kay, Kathy, Robert, others, your calls are coming up.
[01:23:05.469 --> 01:23:13.592]  I'm not going to take any calls for the final 30 minutes of this hour because I want to get into the end of Posse Comitatus and the slide into total slavery.
[01:23:13.632 --> 01:23:14.553]  I mean, this is what it is.
[01:23:15.757 --> 01:23:20.838]  And I guess tonight I've got to get together with Watson and write a big article about this and try to detail this for people.
[01:23:21.358 --> 01:23:24.319]  I mean, this is just really bad, horrible development.
[01:23:25.579 --> 01:23:27.400]  This is Bush openly becoming emperor.
[01:23:28.200 --> 01:23:29.520]  Then, of course, Bush will leave office.
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:31.341]  He'll go, see, it wasn't martial law.
[01:23:31.741 --> 01:23:34.942]  It's the system getting the martial law control grid.
[01:23:34.962 --> 01:23:36.702]  It's the shadow government going public.
[01:23:37.382 --> 01:23:40.903]  But Les in West Virginia has now gotten to a better phone.
[01:23:41.143 --> 01:23:43.324]  Les, yes, Bush is all over TV.
[01:23:43.344 --> 01:23:44.604]  He announced it here from Austin.
[01:23:46.408 --> 01:23:47.689]  It must have been you that stated that...
[01:24:16.653 --> 01:24:21.836]  The New World Order's got everything in place now, and they're just tidying up the furniture.
[01:24:21.876 --> 01:24:23.878]  Was that you or Dave Von Kleisen said that?
[01:24:25.479 --> 01:24:26.819]  No, that's... I mean, I've said that.
[01:24:27.139 --> 01:24:28.160]  You may have said that, too.
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:35.644]  Okay, well, at any rate, I went into the family room, and my wife was watching TV, and I asked her if she heard it.
[01:24:35.885 --> 01:24:43.429]  She said yes, and even the military men agree with him that the military should be in charge of these chaotic events.
[01:24:44.457 --> 01:24:46.959]  I mean, this is really putting the furniture in order.
[01:24:48.620 --> 01:24:49.201]  Well, it is.
[01:24:49.361 --> 01:24:55.105]  But notice that they don't need the endopause commentatus to have the military involved.
[01:24:55.145 --> 01:24:56.507]  This is federal troops.
[01:24:57.888 --> 01:25:00.910]  In fact, I have Scott McClellan from Friday, a press conference he gave.
[01:25:00.970 --> 01:25:03.252]  I printed off the White House website what he said.
[01:25:03.272 --> 01:25:05.233]  It's actually here in the stack.
[01:25:05.313 --> 01:25:07.895]  But he said security is the main problem.
[01:25:08.516 --> 01:25:09.597]  It's the main breakdown.
[01:25:09.637 --> 01:25:10.798]  We need armed troops.
[01:25:11.659 --> 01:25:13.781]  Now, as a Sunday school teacher, I study quite a bit of the Bible.
[01:25:13.801 --> 01:25:15.142]  It's just fitting right in.
[01:25:15.182 --> 01:25:19.665]  What you're doing, what I'm doing, the rest of us, the listeners are doing, all in the Bible.
[01:25:20.125 --> 01:25:20.465]  We're watchmen.
[01:25:20.485 --> 01:25:21.206]  We're watchmen.
[01:25:41.246 --> 01:25:46.790]  And we need to spread it around, get more people, turn to Christ.
[01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:48.891]  I think that's our final plan.
[01:25:48.951 --> 01:25:49.731]  Fight the new order.
[01:25:50.112 --> 01:25:50.352]  Sure.
[01:25:50.772 --> 01:25:51.512]  I agree with you.
[01:25:51.552 --> 01:25:52.593]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[01:25:52.633 --> 01:25:53.174]  God bless.
[01:25:53.374 --> 01:25:53.594]  Look.
[01:25:57.347 --> 01:26:05.890]  You notice there were Dutch, still are, Mexican, British, and other foreign troops involved in Louisiana, in New Orleans, and surrounding areas.
[01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:08.731]  So foreign troops setting the precedent.
[01:26:09.211 --> 01:26:11.452]  So next time you'll be more accustomed to it.
[01:26:11.992 --> 01:26:14.333]  And we're not just stretching that and saying that.
[01:26:15.373 --> 01:26:26.257]  The Pentagon says that if we're, quote, tied down in the foreign war on terror, that foreign assets will be used here domestically.
[01:26:27.899 --> 01:26:30.401]  I've been to the urban warfare training drills all over the country.
[01:26:30.461 --> 01:26:36.246]  I've got footage from Fort Polk, Louisiana, where they train with Czech Republic and other Eastern Bloc troops.
[01:26:37.166 --> 01:26:38.107]  This is real.
[01:26:38.548 --> 01:26:39.428]  This is happening.
[01:26:40.829 --> 01:26:42.250]  And so it's not just troops.
[01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:48.876]  It's going to be foreign troops and private mercenary, Blackwater and ISI and other groups.
[01:26:49.636 --> 01:26:54.240]  By the way, ISI, these were armed Israelis there.
[01:26:55.723 --> 01:26:57.465]  And so it's already happening.
[01:26:57.585 --> 01:27:04.050]  It's just slowly we're being bathed in it, being basted, being marinated in this police state.
[01:27:05.832 --> 01:27:17.842]  And the secret arrest of citizens in the foreign camps in Cuba and the CIA torture jets on the runways and this whole infrastructure being put in place.
[01:27:17.902 --> 01:27:19.223]  And then the nukes go off.
[01:27:19.918 --> 01:27:25.880]  And then the great leader deals with the crisis and the military takes control for everyone's own good.
[01:27:27.701 --> 01:27:30.121]  See, now you understand why FEMA blocks food and water.
[01:27:30.161 --> 01:27:33.863]  Now you know why they jammed police communications so the police would leave their post.
[01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:39.244]  So there'd be a bigger crisis so they could then say, Oh, we've got to really have martial law now.
[01:27:39.684 --> 01:27:41.185]  And that's what this is to keep you safe.
[01:27:42.555 --> 01:27:44.137]  And oh, the terrorists might attack us.
[01:27:44.157 --> 01:27:47.460]  We need armed troops in the shopping malls searching your bags.
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:51.384]  We need checkpoints on the highways and transponders in all your cars.
[01:27:51.504 --> 01:27:53.225]  Oh, but the border is going to stay wide open.
[01:27:55.067 --> 01:27:57.309]  Notice how A to Z this is all being done.
[01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:59.832]  And armed military.
[01:27:59.852 --> 01:28:03.095]  We've got to have the armed military because a few hundred thugs were looting.
[01:28:03.936 --> 01:28:04.757]  And while the police...
[01:28:05.752 --> 01:28:08.375]  And all those different counties couldn't deal with them.
[01:28:08.435 --> 01:28:12.578]  Why, we need the Army to deal with the American people and the Marines.
[01:28:13.479 --> 01:28:14.700]  Only they can do it.
[01:28:15.621 --> 01:28:17.603]  Yes, yes!
[01:28:17.623 --> 01:28:24.509]  I mean, all these years we've talked about it, and now it's manifesting.
[01:28:24.849 --> 01:28:26.731]  Troops to patrol America.
[01:28:27.111 --> 01:28:28.793]  Foreign troops here helping.
[01:28:30.514 --> 01:28:32.516]  Oh, yes, federalization.
[01:28:33.448 --> 01:28:35.149]  Oh, the government really screwed up.
[01:28:35.169 --> 01:28:36.909]  We better give them unlimited power.
[01:28:36.929 --> 01:28:42.191]  It's a dictatorship, folks, when the leader wants to use the troops on the people.
[01:28:43.991 --> 01:28:44.911]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.371 --> 01:28:46.992]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.912 --> 01:28:50.593]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.341 --> 01:28:56.783]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:28:57.504 --> 01:29:01.127]  Have you ever heard of the Genocide Convention Treaty to the United Nations?
[01:29:01.767 --> 01:29:05.671]  Did you know that it's a direct assault upon your freedom of religion?
[01:29:06.351 --> 01:29:14.919]  Did you know that if you mention perverted sex acts as being wrong according to the Bible, you could be arrested and tried for causing mental harm to others?
[01:29:15.894 --> 01:29:23.097]  It's already law in Canada, Australia, Britain, and Sweden where Christians are being tried and deprived of freedom of speech.
[01:29:23.997 --> 01:29:32.120]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.

[01:29:53.763 --> 01:30:02.027]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.267 --> 01:30:06.649]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.929 --> 01:30:15.833]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:16.053 --> 01:30:19.675]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.955 --> 01:30:25.005]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:31.999]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.498 --> 01:30:33.138]  What about you?
[01:30:33.799 --> 01:30:39.142]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:31:58.664 --> 01:32:00.566]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:32:01.066 --> 01:32:03.888]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:10.513]  In my film Police State 2000, I show the U.S.
[01:32:10.533 --> 01:32:13.476]  Marine Corps with troops from five other nations.
[01:32:14.677 --> 01:32:18.660]  The Netherlands, Israel, England, you name it.
[01:32:19.398 --> 01:32:31.541]  They're training to confiscate your guns, the role players, screaming, I'm an American, no, not the camp, people being interrogated, what city are you from, I'm from San Francisco, where'd you get the helmet, where'd you get the weapons?
[01:32:32.641 --> 01:32:45.924]  So, I mean, I'm there in the late 90s videotaping this, and having listeners send me video from Hebron, Maryland, and Swansboro, North Carolina, and I'm in urban warfare drills here in Texas, and they're training to take over and capture America.
[01:32:47.296 --> 01:32:49.077]  And people were in denial.
[01:32:49.117 --> 01:32:50.237]  Oh, that's ridiculous.
[01:32:50.978 --> 01:32:55.940]  And I said they'll use terrorism, they'll use disaster, they're already federalizing cities with funds.
[01:32:56.020 --> 01:32:57.780]  This is so they can really abuse us.
[01:32:58.221 --> 01:33:00.381]  This is what always happens in dictatorships.
[01:33:00.421 --> 01:33:02.542]  This is the norm.
[01:33:04.303 --> 01:33:06.784]  This has happened in America several times before.
[01:33:07.164 --> 01:33:08.845]  This is very serious.
[01:33:09.785 --> 01:33:13.947]  Police State 2000, Police State to the Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:33:13.987 --> 01:33:15.187]  You need to get those films, folks.
[01:33:15.448 --> 01:33:16.328]  They're so important.
[01:33:18.007 --> 01:33:20.428]  But to boil it all down, we're being captured.
[01:33:20.508 --> 01:33:22.329]  We're the big prize.
[01:33:23.890 --> 01:33:27.511]  You think the globalists are in Iraq to get oil and use Iraq as a military base?
[01:33:27.551 --> 01:33:27.992]  They are.
[01:33:29.012 --> 01:33:35.735]  But Iraq is really a repository to dump money into so the corporations can suck it out of the trough.
[01:33:36.896 --> 01:33:44.359]  They'd rather just totally capture the United States through the whole continuity of government and through the whole shadow government system
[01:33:45.306 --> 01:33:47.508]  And just set themselves up as kings here.
[01:33:47.568 --> 01:34:03.082]  And once they've got us fully captured as their engine of war, once we're total slaves, and only have the illusion of voting with the CIA-controlled electronic voting machines, then they can use us to really start a war for empire and really start invading the planet.
[01:34:03.822 --> 01:34:09.928]  And if you don't like it, some nice men in black masks will drop by to take you to a death camp and blow your head clean off your shoulders.
[01:34:10.814 --> 01:34:19.220]  Only thing holding them back, folks, is they haven't warped enough people to be those death squad commandos yet, though they're trying to warp enough people to create a big enough army of darkness.
[01:34:21.062 --> 01:34:25.865]  And at the same time, they know you've got guns, and once they start it, it's not going to go well for them.
[01:34:27.527 --> 01:34:29.288]  So we're right on the verge here.
[01:34:31.081 --> 01:34:36.823]  And there are going to be a lot of people that are going to say, I support the troops, because they're deep down afraid of the government.
[01:34:37.143 --> 01:34:39.684]  They're going to be cheerleading the gun confiscation.
[01:34:39.724 --> 01:34:40.644]  A lot of conservatives.
[01:34:41.064 --> 01:34:46.266]  They're going to be cheerleading and be part of little local tattletale squads that call in the troops on you.
[01:34:47.066 --> 01:34:51.227]  And they're going to have their kids in the local tattletale squads.
[01:34:51.787 --> 01:34:52.708]  Just like in 1984.
[01:34:53.108 --> 01:34:57.369]  Orwell was just writing about things he'd already experienced.
[01:34:58.536 --> 01:35:07.859]  Living in India, living in communist Spain, in Franco-Spain, working at the BBC during the war, you know, the tactics he saw Stalin use.
[01:35:09.479 --> 01:35:12.340]  Bush heads to Colorado for military takeover drill.
[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:16.762]  I'm going to go over this article that Paul Watson and I put together.
[01:35:17.182 --> 01:35:23.024]  But before I do that, let me slowly read you this Washington Post article by William M. Arkin.
[01:35:24.364 --> 01:35:25.765]  Okay, now listen carefully.
[01:35:25.805 --> 01:35:26.945]  I'm going to go over this article.
[01:35:29.372 --> 01:35:30.673]  This is very important.
[01:35:31.614 --> 01:35:34.917]  Today in D.C., commandos in the streets.
[01:35:36.879 --> 01:35:38.401]  Today, somewhere in D.C.
[01:35:38.421 --> 01:35:45.087]  metropolitan area, the military is conducting a highly classified granite shadow demonstration.
[01:35:47.566 --> 01:35:56.569]  Granite Shadow is yet another top-secret compartmented operation, not a drill, related to the military's extra-legal powers regarding weapons of mass destruction.
[01:35:57.009 --> 01:36:02.331]  It allows for emergency military operations in the United States without civilian supervision or control.
[01:36:02.351 --> 01:36:03.651]  That's a dictatorship.
[01:36:04.571 --> 01:36:12.494]  A spokesman at the Joint Forces Headquarters National Capital Region, JFHQNCR, same folks running the drills on 9-11,
[01:36:13.624 --> 01:36:22.710]  Confirmed the existence of Granite Shadow to me yesterday, but all he would say is that Granite Shadow is the unclassified name for a classified plan.
[01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:26.492]  It's continuity of government martial law takeover, folks.
[01:36:27.452 --> 01:36:33.536]  The classified plan, I believe, after extensive research, after making a couple of assumptions, is Con Plan 0400.
[01:36:35.447 --> 01:36:52.844]  Formally titled Counterproliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Concept Plan Conplan 0400 is a long-standing contingency plan of the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff that serves as the umbrella for military efforts to counter the spread of WMDs.
[01:36:53.344 --> 01:36:55.886]  It has extensively been updated and revised since 9-11.
[01:36:57.532 --> 01:37:06.834]  The CGCS plan lays out national policy and priorities for dealing with WMD threats in peacetime and in crisis.
[01:37:07.434 --> 01:37:19.777]  From far away offensive strikes and special operations against foreign WMD infrastructure capabilities to missile defense and consequence management at home if offenses efforts fail.
[01:37:20.958 --> 01:37:22.218]  All of the military planning
[01:37:22.947 --> 01:37:37.354]  Incorporates the technical capabilities of the intelligence agencies and non-military organizations, such as the National Laboratories of the Department of Energy, and finally, by the way, the Department of Energy's main security force is thousands, and it's Israeli troops.
[01:37:37.374 --> 01:37:39.295]  Just thought I'd add that there for you.
[01:37:39.936 --> 01:37:41.597]  And it's just all hidden in plain view, folks.
[01:37:41.637 --> 01:37:42.437]  Private contractors.
[01:37:42.937 --> 01:37:50.121]  And finally, ConPlan 0400 directs regional combatant commanders to...
[01:37:50.993 --> 01:37:55.577]  Customize computer proliferation plans for each of their own areas of operations.
[01:37:56.317 --> 01:38:00.260]  When that area of operations is the United States, things become particularly sensitive.
[01:38:00.901 --> 01:38:02.902]  That's where Granite Shadow comes in, U.S.
[01:38:02.942 --> 01:38:04.463]  Northern Command or NORTHCOM.
[01:38:05.084 --> 01:38:09.087]  While this drill was going on, he came and called it a drill, this Operation Bush was at NORTHCOM.
[01:38:09.567 --> 01:38:12.429]  And you notice he said, I'm here to oversee how we do things.
[01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:14.291]  So he even admitted what he was there for.
[01:38:15.620 --> 01:38:17.521]  That's where Granite Shadow comes in, U.S.
[01:38:17.561 --> 01:38:45.312]  Northern Command, the military's new Homeland Security Command, is preparing its draft version of ConPlan 0400 for military operations in the United States, and the resulting Granite Shadow plan has been, you see Granite Shadow, the Shadow government, Granite, you know, big monolith of power, has been classified above top secret, that's the article, by adding a special category SEP cap
[01:38:46.744 --> 01:38:48.565]  Compartment restricting access.
[01:38:48.945 --> 01:38:50.025]  So it's compartmentalized.
[01:38:51.346 --> 01:38:52.966]  It's all PDD 25, folks.
[01:38:53.026 --> 01:38:54.007]  Total martial law.
[01:38:54.507 --> 01:38:57.528]  I mean, they can have it all classified, but I've been to the drills.
[01:38:57.568 --> 01:38:58.868]  It's to take over city halls.
[01:38:59.328 --> 01:39:03.230]  It's to kill local officials if so needed.
[01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:06.691]  It's to engage the local police and take out leadership.
[01:39:07.171 --> 01:39:09.752]  I mean, you want to... Of course, it's not going to work.
[01:39:09.792 --> 01:39:10.452]  It'll never work.
[01:39:11.052 --> 01:39:13.273]  But you pinheads never figure that out in history, so...
[01:39:14.919 --> 01:39:19.743]  The sensitivities, according to military sources, include deployment of special mission units.
[01:39:19.763 --> 01:39:21.424]  Of course, it's not meant to work.
[01:39:21.525 --> 01:39:24.227]  Once they start it, put to flood us with foreign troops, folks.
[01:39:24.968 --> 01:39:34.816]  The sensitivities, according to military sources, include deployment of special mission units, the so-called Delta Force, SEAL teams, Rangers, and other special units of Joint Special Operations Command.
[01:39:34.836 --> 01:39:37.579]  Let's see, we've been to their drills, folks.
[01:39:39.019 --> 01:39:40.040]  In Washington, D.C.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:43.502]  and other domestic hot spots around the country.
[01:39:43.942 --> 01:39:45.503]  NORTHCOM has worked closely with U.S.
[01:39:45.523 --> 01:39:56.069]  Special Operations Command as well as the secret branches of non-military agencies and departments to enforce unity of command over any post-9-11 efforts.
[01:39:57.069 --> 01:39:59.130]  Again, they'd set this all up before 9-11.
[01:39:59.430 --> 01:40:03.032]  That was the triggering event to bring it out into the public partially.
[01:40:03.452 --> 01:40:06.054]  Now they're just going to bring more of it slowly out into public
[01:40:06.753 --> 01:40:09.036]  They think you've been domesticated enough now for that.
[01:40:10.557 --> 01:40:11.839]  This is where it gets really interesting.
[01:40:12.159 --> 01:40:20.067]  Further, Granite Shadow posts dramatic military operations, including intelligence collection and surveillance.
[01:40:20.087 --> 01:40:22.530]  That's local CIA they've already announced in your town.
[01:40:23.010 --> 01:40:24.411]  Unique rules of engagement.
[01:40:24.812 --> 01:40:26.654]  You practice that at Waco, killing little kids.
[01:40:27.282 --> 01:40:30.204]  And now Shoemaker's the head of everything, the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
[01:40:30.944 --> 01:40:31.664]  The guy that ran it.
[01:40:31.945 --> 01:40:34.846]  Unique rules of engagement regarding the use of lethal force.
[01:40:35.206 --> 01:40:37.127]  We've already bloodied our men on children.
[01:40:37.188 --> 01:40:39.669]  They're ready to eat their guts and ass for seconds.
[01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:41.230]  I'm sorry, let me start over.
[01:40:42.130 --> 01:40:45.512]  We've already promoted Shoemaker to the top ranks.
[01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:50.015]  By the way, he was also over all the big mind control experiments.
[01:40:50.055 --> 01:40:51.275]  That's now admitted publicly.
[01:40:53.076 --> 01:40:54.217]  Really nice fellow.
[01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:59.132]  Really likes that Bohemian Grove, let me tell you.
[01:40:59.632 --> 01:41:17.262]  Further granted shadow posts, domestic military operations, including intelligence collection and surveillance, unique rules of engagement regarding the use of lethal force, the use of experimental non-lethal weapons, use that at Waco too, and federal and military control of incident locations, i.e.
[01:41:17.302 --> 01:41:20.964]  your city that are highly controversial and might border on illegal.
[01:41:21.024 --> 01:41:21.704]  That's the article.
[01:41:23.285 --> 01:41:23.685]  I.e.
[01:41:23.725 --> 01:41:24.686]  taking over your city's
[01:41:25.862 --> 01:41:31.907]  It says, in federal and military control of incident locations that are highly controversial and might border on illegal.
[01:41:32.327 --> 01:41:32.988]  Might border?
[01:41:33.048 --> 01:41:35.930]  No, it's totally illegal, but we're just being bathed in it now.
[01:41:37.471 --> 01:41:39.813]  Your journey to slavery is almost complete.
[01:41:40.413 --> 01:41:43.796]  Granite Shadow is the twin to Power Geyser.
[01:41:45.257 --> 01:41:46.518]  Power Geyser.
[01:41:48.573 --> 01:41:51.778]  A program I first revealed to the New York Times in January.
[01:41:52.259 --> 01:42:01.674]  The JFHQ spokesman confirmed that Granite Shadow and Power Geyser are two different unclassified names of two different classified plans.
[01:42:02.463 --> 01:42:12.752]  In the case of Power Geyser, the classified plan is CJCS Con Plan 0300, whose entire title is classified according to military documents.
[01:42:13.333 --> 01:42:19.738]  The unclassified title is Counterterrorism Special Operations Support Civilian Agencies in the event of a domestic incident.
[01:42:20.299 --> 01:42:29.527]  It is another top-secret SEPCAT plan directing the same special mission unit to provide weapons of mass destruction recovery and render safe...
[01:42:30.186 --> 01:42:45.078]  In either a terrorist incident or in the case of a stolen or lost nuclear weapon, rendered safe refers to the ability to explosive ordnance disposal experts to isolate and disarm any type of biological, chemical, or nuclear or radiological weapon.
[01:42:45.659 --> 01:42:47.520]  So this is just what they want the news to know.
[01:42:47.560 --> 01:42:48.361]  They're telling them about it.
[01:42:48.381 --> 01:42:50.222]  But if you read, it's from total martial law.
[01:42:51.223 --> 01:42:56.828]  Bush publicly says troops to deal with the general public and non-lethal weapons here in the article to deal with crowds
[01:42:58.163 --> 01:43:01.165]  The obvious question is where there is need for two plans.
[01:43:01.665 --> 01:43:11.370]  My guess is that Power Geyser and Complan 0300 refers to operations in support of civilian agency leads, most likely the Attorney General on a WMD attack.
[01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:14.892]  Well, also, it's clear that Power Geyser is an earlier program, I would add.
[01:43:14.932 --> 01:43:15.332]  It's 0300.
[01:43:15.372 --> 01:43:19.194]  The new Complan 0400 is obviously a later program.
[01:43:20.491 --> 01:43:32.203]  In support of civilian agency lead, most likely the Attorney General, for a WMD attack, while Granite Shadow and Complan 0400 lays out contingencies where the military is in the lead.
[01:43:32.323 --> 01:43:35.787]  I want to be corrected by someone in the know.
[01:43:37.768 --> 01:43:49.474]  Both plans seem to live behind a veil of extraordinary secrecy because military forces operating under them have already been given a series of special authorities by the President and the Secretary of Defense.
[01:43:49.854 --> 01:43:59.459]  These special authorities include, presumably, military roles in civilian law enforcement and abrogation of state powers in a declared or perceived emergency.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:00.500]  Now again, folks...
[01:44:02.262 --> 01:44:09.690]  The end of the Roman Republic was when Caesar marched across the Rubicon in the north and came down and took over the city with his troops.
[01:44:10.891 --> 01:44:21.061]  Caesar was not allowed to be in the city while there were two leaders of the Senate in that day.
[01:44:21.742 --> 01:44:23.744]  And both leaders of the Senate couldn't be there.
[01:44:24.344 --> 01:44:26.086]  And so it was a tribune.
[01:44:26.912 --> 01:44:31.855]  And so whatever member was already in the city, if he was there, he had to leave so Caesar could come in.
[01:44:32.435 --> 01:44:38.819]  And Caesar couldn't bring his forces ever into the city.
[01:44:40.199 --> 01:44:49.064]  Again, you don't let the leader or the president bring his troops into the city of Rome.
[01:44:50.885 --> 01:44:55.628]  In fact, they're not even supposed to cross the Rubicon and come into Italy properly.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:44:58.900]  Do you understand that?
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:07.963]  So in Rome, folks, the fall of the Republic was when Caesar brought his troops across the Rubicon.
[01:45:12.225 --> 01:45:13.325]  And of course, how did he do that?
[01:45:13.826 --> 01:45:23.609]  They staged an attempted assassination, basically on his little Viceroy minion, and then, oh, we're under attack, we've got to come into the city.
[01:45:25.274 --> 01:45:29.918]  And Caesar's family made their money running the local fire departments.
[01:45:29.978 --> 01:45:34.642]  They would threaten to burn things down if you didn't pay them protection money.
[01:45:34.902 --> 01:45:40.066]  You know, when the Italian mafia says, pay me 10% of your gross or I'm going to burn your grocery store down.
[01:45:40.086 --> 01:45:43.069]  You know, they didn't invent that, folks.
[01:45:43.129 --> 01:45:44.250]  That was just picked up.
[01:45:44.970 --> 01:45:50.395]  The La Cosa Nostra there in Italy and in Sicily were just imitating what the old Romans had done.
[01:45:50.735 --> 01:45:51.996]  So it's just a side issue.
[01:45:52.873 --> 01:45:57.955]  Government-sponsored terrorism gave him his money and his power, got him into his position.
[01:45:58.315 --> 01:46:02.697]  He then massed his large army in the name of taming the Gauls and the Visigoths.
[01:46:03.557 --> 01:46:14.841]  And then the end of the Roman Republic, and then the next subsequent 200-year decline, took place and happened because Caesar went in and centralized control.
[01:46:17.802 --> 01:46:19.803]  And this is why banana republics are so unstable.
[01:46:20.535 --> 01:46:28.178]  Because once this system is fully in command, then you will have elites fighting for control of the levers of power here in America.
[01:46:29.739 --> 01:46:31.740]  I mean, this is the worst thing you can imagine.
[01:46:31.780 --> 01:46:35.241]  This is as dirty and as low down and as bad as it gets.
[01:46:35.881 --> 01:46:37.922]  And don't worry, Caesar had his excuses for it.
[01:46:40.223 --> 01:46:46.666]  I mean, the Brits brought in troops here to suppress their population, and that started 1776 with Lexington and Concord.
[01:46:49.208 --> 01:46:52.489]  And so this is America being conquered.
[01:46:52.549 --> 01:46:53.649]  We're the big prize.
[01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:58.391]  This is the private corporate interests that own and control our government, taking control of our nation.
[01:47:00.511 --> 01:47:01.352]  This continues.
[01:47:02.112 --> 01:47:10.774]  Where the military is in the lead, the military's role in civilian law enforcement and abrogation of states' powers in a declared or perceived emergency.
[01:47:11.294 --> 01:47:16.336]  In January, when the New York Times reported on the Power Geyser name for my codename website,
[01:47:17.355 --> 01:47:22.279]  The Pentagon argued it would be irresponsible to comment on any classified program that may or may not exist.
[01:47:22.959 --> 01:47:26.862]  I can't see how the Defense Department can continue this line of argument post-Katrina.
[01:47:27.283 --> 01:47:28.303]  Well, exactly.
[01:47:28.323 --> 01:47:30.325]  See, so the article says it's good at the end.
[01:47:31.406 --> 01:47:36.850]  And so now Bush, right on cue, is saying, yes, we need law enforcement power for our military.
[01:47:39.344 --> 01:47:48.794]  We see the human cost of a system of contingency planning done in complete secret, with a lack of any debate as to what should be done in federal government's priorities, emphasis, and rules.
[01:47:49.595 --> 01:47:56.723]  As the Granite Shadow Commandos and their federal brethren go through their paces today, some inside the system will lament that
[01:47:57.648 --> 01:47:59.810]  That I have compromised their work.
[01:48:00.250 --> 01:48:09.497]  But the very fact that nothing in my writing damages the granted shadow effort to demonstrate that we can have a discussion of contingency planning for authorities in the United States.
[01:48:09.677 --> 01:48:19.644]  A debate extraordinarily special because authorities granted them to those in uniform without compromising the details of the plans themselves.
[01:48:20.208 --> 01:48:21.049]  There's still time.
[01:48:21.089 --> 01:48:26.894]  The full-scale exercise of Granite Shadow's abilities and procedures doesn't start until April 2006.
[01:48:27.094 --> 01:48:30.237]  That's the end of the article.
[01:48:32.579 --> 01:48:45.070]  And then Bush, while this is going on, and this is a martial law drill for taking over the country, he runs out to the command bunker there in Colorado Springs.
[01:48:46.505 --> 01:48:46.986]  We're good to go.
[01:49:05.757 --> 01:49:05.857]  So, uh,
[01:49:37.904 --> 01:49:38.766]  This isn't a joke.
[01:49:40.710 --> 01:49:46.582]  So see, they had to screw up in New Orleans to then say, oh, see, we need more hunts.
[01:49:47.283 --> 01:49:49.448]  Oh, see, the military's got to take all our rights away.
[01:49:50.709 --> 01:49:53.170]  What would George Washington have said?
[01:49:54.511 --> 01:50:01.914]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.174 --> 01:50:06.916]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.136 --> 01:50:12.778]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.018 --> 01:50:13.738]  We're good to go.
[01:50:29.306 --> 01:50:29.927]  Or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:29.987 --> 01:50:30.307]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:54.224 --> 01:50:57.227]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.587 --> 01:51:06.416]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.716 --> 01:51:11.401]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.861 --> 01:51:18.586]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.987 --> 01:51:30.756]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.236 --> 01:51:35.700]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:35.860 --> 01:51:38.322]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:40.203 --> 01:51:41.404]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:41.464 --> 01:51:42.925]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:42.945 --> 01:51:44.006]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:54.850 --> 01:52:00.798]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:01.019 --> 01:52:03.282]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.482 --> 01:52:09.831]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, Colloidal Silver 500 parts per million, Olive Leaf Extract,
[01:52:10.151 --> 01:52:10.812]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.404 --> 01:52:31.004]  We're good to go.
[01:52:55.152 --> 01:53:09.083]  America is the prize.
[01:53:09.303 --> 01:53:10.965]  Capture America.
[01:53:11.005 --> 01:53:14.848]  You've got the engine to militarily take over the globe.
[01:53:15.649 --> 01:53:18.311]  But even more importantly, you then have Hollywood.
[01:53:19.912 --> 01:53:21.614]  You then have the dominant media.
[01:53:22.358 --> 01:53:29.600]  With the English-speaking media, with English being the world language, and so you can engage in the information war against the globe.
[01:53:30.780 --> 01:53:35.201]  And Professor Thomas Barnett at the Naval War College says this, Dick Cheney says it.
[01:53:35.541 --> 01:53:36.422]  They all say it.
[01:53:36.482 --> 01:53:37.982]  That's how dumb they think you are.
[01:53:40.743 --> 01:53:48.885]  Barnett got up on C-SPAN and said, we work for global government, and we work for Wall Street, and we're going to take the planet over, and we're an empire.
[01:53:50.350 --> 01:53:53.993]  And it was a giant room of generals and colonels.
[01:53:54.033 --> 01:53:56.575]  They're all going to get jobs with Big Fortune 500 after their stint.
[01:53:56.595 --> 01:54:02.279]  They're going to be well taken care of, out there playing golf, living in million-dollar houses and golf courses.
[01:54:02.339 --> 01:54:03.580]  And it's so easy.
[01:54:04.020 --> 01:54:08.404]  Meanwhile, the government's going to be bid-rigging and scamming here domestically and paying into select corporations.
[01:54:08.424 --> 01:54:11.266]  There'll be less and less opportunity, less and less jobs.
[01:54:11.666 --> 01:54:18.071]  There'll be transponders in all our cars, total oppression, horrible forced inoculations, just so much evil.
[01:54:18.894 --> 01:54:25.236]  They'll start harvesting and selling prisoners' organs like China does as we just go on to this decadent evil model.
[01:54:26.696 --> 01:54:27.516]  But that's all right.
[01:54:27.556 --> 01:54:34.358]  You'll be a retired general and you'll get to play golf and be tough and have your little security pass card, get to go to the meetings.
[01:54:35.399 --> 01:54:43.061]  When you get out of the FBI, you'll get to be a local sheriff and sit over the people and get all the payoffs and the money and just rule us.
[01:54:44.241 --> 01:54:45.181]  And you'll kill America.
[01:54:45.362 --> 01:54:45.802]  Good job.
[01:54:46.102 --> 01:54:46.962]  Really good job.
[01:54:47.757 --> 01:54:48.418]  Great job.
[01:54:48.518 --> 01:54:50.179]  I just want to really thank you for all you've done.
[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:57.426]  And I want to thank all the scum that says, well, we just got to do whatever the government says and let the troops run our lives.
[01:54:57.466 --> 01:54:58.747]  That's how you support them.
[01:54:59.227 --> 01:55:00.569]  Troops aren't supposed to be here.
[01:55:00.989 --> 01:55:07.815]  It's bad enough to have them roving around for the empire overseas, but is Caesar bringing his troops into Rome, man?
[01:55:08.376 --> 01:55:09.637]  Folks, that is just, that's it.
[01:55:12.759 --> 01:55:24.250]  And, you know, they'll have the troops out and they'll save the little kids in the water and they'll law enforcement and they'll stop bank robbers and there'll be lots of examples on TV about how it's good.
[01:55:24.671 --> 01:55:27.273]  See, Alex, you talked about gloom and doom with the troops.
[01:55:28.694 --> 01:55:30.096]  They've really done a great job.
[01:55:30.754 --> 01:55:31.815]  The media says so!
[01:55:32.215 --> 01:55:47.161]  And again, it'll just all be incremental, all incremental, until 20 years from now, you can't leave your house, you know, after midnight, your swipe card won't open, and everything you do is tracked, and you'll be called in for weekly reports to your local neighborhood watch commander.
[01:55:47.361 --> 01:55:49.262]  We notice you've been doing a little too much of this.
[01:55:49.342 --> 01:55:53.164]  Are you with the secret insurgents that refuse the microchip?
[01:55:53.832 --> 01:55:54.232]  I know.
[01:55:54.412 --> 01:55:55.853]  I got my microchip.
[01:55:55.953 --> 01:55:58.714]  I'm even volunteering next month for the brain implant.
[01:55:59.114 --> 01:55:59.534]  Oh, good.
[01:55:59.554 --> 01:56:00.654]  You'll be one of us then.
[01:56:01.034 --> 01:56:02.335]  The Pentagon actually says this.
[01:56:02.955 --> 01:56:03.235]  I know.
[01:56:03.315 --> 01:56:04.215]  Laugh at me, folks.
[01:56:04.255 --> 01:56:04.695]  Laugh at me.
[01:56:05.015 --> 01:56:05.456]  You'll see.
[01:56:06.316 --> 01:56:08.817]  Twenty years from now, you'll go, how on earth did that guy know that?
[01:56:10.837 --> 01:56:13.778]  Now you take your children for their implant.
[01:56:14.358 --> 01:56:15.159]  It's okay, honey.
[01:56:15.199 --> 01:56:16.279]  It's just a short procedure.
[01:56:16.809 --> 01:56:20.750]  You'll be able to interface and they'll accept you at the new high school.
[01:56:20.970 --> 01:56:27.052]  There aren't a lot of opportunities, but if you get this chip in here, if you get this modification, everything will be a lot better.
[01:56:27.612 --> 01:56:30.473]  You see, by controlling the economy, they control your activities.
[01:56:30.493 --> 01:56:31.773]  They control the purse strings.
[01:56:32.053 --> 01:56:33.594]  They can socially engineer you.
[01:56:33.894 --> 01:56:36.275]  Freedom gives you the freedom to say no to their control.
[01:56:37.515 --> 01:56:39.155]  It's going to get so bad, folks.
[01:56:39.316 --> 01:56:40.236]  So horrible.
[01:56:41.516 --> 01:56:44.397]  And I just want you to remember that we warned you and we fought against it.
[01:56:46.300 --> 01:56:47.661]  Just no end to the corruption.
[01:56:49.021 --> 01:56:50.782]  These are social engineers, folks.
[01:56:51.983 --> 01:56:53.864]  You're like, they're not going to make us take chips.
[01:56:54.164 --> 01:57:00.327]  Oh, Tommy Thompson's out saying how great it is, and they're on 60 Minutes saying everybody needs a chip to prove they're good.
[01:57:01.068 --> 01:57:02.028]  It's all over the news.
[01:57:02.408 --> 01:57:04.029]  We're living in the twilight zone.
[01:57:04.069 --> 01:57:05.070]  They're out of control.
[01:57:07.171 --> 01:57:13.094]  I hope you'll go to prisonplanet.com or infowars.com and get my martial law videos.
[01:57:14.275 --> 01:57:15.656]  Get the police state videos.
[01:57:15.736 --> 01:57:18.218]  Get them, make copies, expose these people.
[01:57:18.738 --> 01:57:19.519]  Take Road to Tyranny.
[01:57:19.679 --> 01:57:22.982]  We have FEMA saying all Christians are terrorists and enemies of the government.
[01:57:24.563 --> 01:57:26.024]  I mean, this is what they teach nationwide.
[01:57:26.064 --> 01:57:27.525]  I mean, people need to know this, folks.
[01:57:29.026 --> 01:57:30.927]  They can't stand if these secrets are revealed.
[01:57:33.489 --> 01:57:38.393]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.715 --> 01:57:50.356]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.016 --> 01:57:52.077]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.777 --> 01:57:53.998]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.559 --> 01:57:55.379]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.120 --> 01:57:57.641]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.681 --> 01:58:01.324]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.864 --> 01:58:06.008]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.608 --> 01:58:12.513]  The globalists call you dumb animals.
[01:58:12.573 --> 01:58:13.774]  They call you slaves.
[01:58:13.814 --> 01:58:14.874]  They call you insects.
[01:58:15.095 --> 01:58:15.375]  Cattle.
[01:58:17.188 --> 01:58:21.532]  And you laugh up their lies and their propaganda and you giggle about it and love being fools.
[01:58:21.552 --> 01:58:24.795]  I'm not talking about our audience, but some of the general public out there.
[01:58:24.815 --> 01:58:27.017]  It's time to stop being so naive.
[01:58:27.598 --> 01:58:38.627]  We covered how the government's openly announcing the end of posse commentatus and literal martial law to rule our daily lives, no due process, secret arrest, secret torture, secret camps.
[01:58:39.828 --> 01:58:42.491]  This is the freedom they want to give us while the border stays wide open.
[01:58:43.738 --> 01:58:47.683]  Well, every major terrorist event leads back to the very people setting up the police state.
[01:58:48.344 --> 01:58:49.246]  Surprise, surprise.
[01:58:49.566 --> 01:58:51.248]  We'll also get into some good news.
[01:58:51.448 --> 01:58:53.311]  Major gun victory for firearms owners.
[01:58:55.113 --> 01:58:56.355]  But, I mean, we're in the fight, folks.
[01:58:56.375 --> 01:58:57.877]  We're not going to lose this thing with God's help.
[01:58:58.438 --> 01:59:00.721]  But right now, let's go ahead and take some calls.
[01:59:01.539 --> 01:59:04.300]  Let's talk to Kaie, and you're calling from Boston.
[01:59:04.320 --> 01:59:04.781]  Go ahead.
[01:59:05.041 --> 01:59:06.081]  Yes, I am.
[01:59:06.161 --> 01:59:07.302]  I've been waiting.
[01:59:08.122 --> 01:59:09.603]  Well, ma'am, I'm sorry about that.
[01:59:09.703 --> 01:59:10.324]  That's okay.
[01:59:10.544 --> 01:59:10.844]  Okay.
[01:59:11.024 --> 01:59:12.145]  I'm happy to hear you.
[01:59:14.286 --> 01:59:17.787]  My husband and I, we show some of your videos in our community.
[01:59:18.168 --> 01:59:18.488]  Thank you.
[01:59:18.568 --> 01:59:28.333]  And I wanted to mention, I think one of the problems is that our local officials and some of the legislators in our local communities
[01:59:29.093 --> 01:59:32.674]  That know what's going on with Homeland Security and things like that.
[01:59:32.754 --> 01:59:39.496]  Our teachers, the police force that is now the military, they don't come out and tell what's going on.
[01:59:40.476 --> 01:59:45.838]  They continue to pretend to the people in the communities that everything's normal.
[01:59:46.098 --> 01:59:47.158]  That's one of the problems.
[01:59:47.619 --> 01:59:50.860]  But anyway, I called to ask you a question because I have an illness.
[01:59:50.940 --> 01:59:52.320]  I cannot use computers.
[01:59:53.021 --> 01:59:53.681]  I don't believe so.
[02:00:13.450 --> 02:00:14.071]  On the radio?
[02:00:14.251 --> 02:00:15.492]  No, ma'am, I don't believe we are.
[02:00:15.512 --> 02:00:18.754]  Okay, that's too bad because I really needed to hear you.
[02:00:19.114 --> 02:00:20.195]  Okay, thank you very much.
[02:00:20.636 --> 02:00:22.737]  Well, no, I'm sorry we're not on there.
[02:00:22.777 --> 02:00:27.201]  You might call that particular station if they're carrying a show like Dave and Joyce.
[02:00:27.281 --> 02:00:38.109]  I've got a sneaking suspicion this broadcast is obviously very similar and there's a good chance of enough people call that station that they would pick up the broadcast.
[02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:43.213]  But let me just add this point to the points that
[02:00:44.457 --> 02:00:45.258]  That you're bringing up.
[02:00:45.818 --> 02:00:47.979]  A lot of local, quote, authorities.
[02:00:48.059 --> 02:00:49.981]  Number one, we have to stop calling them authorities.
[02:00:50.041 --> 02:00:51.001]  I mean, I do it too.
[02:00:51.662 --> 02:00:52.702]  And officials.
[02:00:53.323 --> 02:00:57.606]  Just ten years ago, they were called servants or representatives.
[02:00:58.146 --> 02:00:59.687]  Hey, you're my representative.
[02:00:59.927 --> 02:01:01.228]  Hey, you're my servant.
[02:01:01.968 --> 02:01:04.390]  Now they call us civilians.
[02:01:05.271 --> 02:01:08.633]  They call themselves authorities.
[02:01:08.693 --> 02:01:13.296]  These are definitions from the martial law rule book or lexicon.
[02:01:14.332 --> 02:01:17.052]  So see how they quietly introduce these terms.
[02:01:17.773 --> 02:01:20.053]  Also, that key word, compartmentalization.
[02:01:20.473 --> 02:01:24.954]  Most of your local authorities are compartmentalized and don't know what's going on.
[02:01:27.414 --> 02:01:28.454]  Okay, does that answer your question?
[02:01:28.474 --> 02:01:29.775]  It does.
[02:01:30.095 --> 02:01:31.495]  Well, God bless you.
[02:01:31.515 --> 02:01:32.455]  Keep making the videos.
[02:01:32.495 --> 02:01:33.635]  Keep making copies of them.
[02:01:33.655 --> 02:01:34.275]  We do.
[02:01:34.615 --> 02:01:35.296]  Yeah, we do.
[02:01:35.756 --> 02:01:37.596]  And you should be able to get us on shortwave.
[02:01:37.636 --> 02:01:39.796]  What frequency do you try to tune us in on?
[02:01:40.656 --> 02:01:42.817]  We listen to, let's see here, 947.
[02:01:44.578 --> 02:01:50.582]  9.40, 9840.
[02:01:45.359 --> 02:01:50.582]  That's where we also hear the power hour.
[02:01:50.782 --> 02:01:52.363]  So you are able to hear us on shore wave?
[02:01:52.723 --> 02:01:54.824]  No, I'm able to hear the power hour.
[02:01:54.844 --> 02:01:58.166]  Yeah, no, we're on 9.9, what is it, 9.985?
[02:01:58.466 --> 02:02:01.488]  Yeah, that won't come out here.
[02:02:01.828 --> 02:02:03.029]  Yeah, well, I'm surprised.
[02:02:03.089 --> 02:02:04.090]  It's a pretty big frequency.
[02:02:04.390 --> 02:02:06.091]  Yeah, it won't come out in my area.
[02:02:06.351 --> 02:02:07.912]  Well, I'm really sorry to hear that.
[02:02:07.952 --> 02:02:08.833]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:08.853 --> 02:02:08.913]  But...
[02:02:12.142 --> 02:02:19.487]  We're going to go to break and we're going to come back and we're going to take more of your calls and get into some of this other news.
[02:02:21.248 --> 02:02:23.470]  But I mean, governments always want more power and control.
[02:02:23.490 --> 02:02:25.171]  They always want to dominate populations.
[02:02:25.531 --> 02:02:30.215]  We've become a decadent, snot-nosed country and we're going to be enslaved and we're going to be raped.
[02:02:31.215 --> 02:02:32.957]  I mean, you want to be slaves, folks.
[02:02:32.977 --> 02:02:36.279]  You want to get shoved around and pushed around and
[02:02:36.897 --> 02:02:39.417]  You want to really experience what we've been doing to the rest of the world?
[02:02:39.457 --> 02:02:44.638]  You're going to get a big, fat taste of it real soon.
[02:02:46.479 --> 02:02:49.339]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.579 --> 02:02:50.279]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.379 --> 02:02:51.179]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.500 --> 02:02:56.200]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:00.961]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.361 --> 02:03:05.522]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.762 --> 02:03:08.623]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.703 --> 02:03:13.364]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.564 --> 02:03:17.965]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.205 --> 02:03:25.407]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.687 --> 02:03:28.108]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.268 --> 02:03:30.008]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:03:46.448 --> 02:03:49.431]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:49.791 --> 02:03:58.619]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:58.939 --> 02:04:03.623]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:04.083 --> 02:04:10.808]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:11.208 --> 02:04:22.977]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:23.457 --> 02:04:24.178]  We're good to go.
[02:04:24.198 --> 02:04:24.738]  We're good to go.
[02:04:47.088 --> 02:04:49.530]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:52.553]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[02:04:52.893 --> 02:04:56.936]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[02:04:57.156 --> 02:05:06.444]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, the small, beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname, Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[02:05:06.744 --> 02:05:23.094]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch, loaded with xanthones, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found, fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and sleep.
[02:05:23.114 --> 02:05:23.895]  So much more.
[02:05:24.135 --> 02:05:30.180]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the mangosteen with Zango, the original mangosteen functional health beverage.

[02:05:45.094 --> 02:05:50.137]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:05:50.517 --> 02:05:52.779]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:06:08.886 --> 02:06:15.088]  New Orleans was already a federalized city, and the entire operation, the subsequent breakdown, was all engineers.
[02:06:15.148 --> 02:06:22.791]  They could then push for more authority, more control, total martial law, clamp down on the American people, and more funds.
[02:06:24.072 --> 02:06:29.794]  And the feds came in and ordered the local police and others to start gun confiscations, and the FBI...
[02:06:31.633 --> 02:06:32.914]  Refused to render aid.
[02:06:32.954 --> 02:06:35.757]  They came in in the backs of big army trucks and SWAT gear.
[02:06:36.477 --> 02:06:40.101]  And it was a great precedent-setting case to kick down doors.
[02:06:40.721 --> 02:06:43.584]  They've been drilling for this for so many years, hungrily.
[02:06:44.164 --> 02:06:48.068]  But now they got a chance to kick down doors and go in and engage in gun confiscation.
[02:06:49.129 --> 02:06:51.611]  And they learned what a futile task it was.
[02:06:53.012 --> 02:06:56.876]  Major victory for farms owners and freedom in Louisiana.
[02:06:58.504 --> 02:07:00.706]  The NRA, ILA put this out.
[02:07:00.726 --> 02:07:03.908]  There's an even better press release put out by the Second Amendment Foundation.
[02:07:04.569 --> 02:07:13.736]  We had Mr. Gottlieb on the head of the Second Amendment Foundation Friday to talk about how the feds do want a precedent-setting case to get your guns nationwide.
[02:07:15.037 --> 02:07:30.061]  The United States District Court for the Eastern District in Louisiana today sided with the National Rifle Association and issued a restraining order to bar further gun confiscations from peaceable and law-abiding victims of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans.
[02:07:32.001 --> 02:07:34.982]  But the feds have already been ignoring other rulings, so why should they care?
[02:07:35.342 --> 02:07:39.003]  This is a significant victory for freedom and for the victims of Hurricane Katrina.
[02:07:40.424 --> 02:07:41.384]  The court's ruling...
[02:07:43.513 --> 02:08:03.859]  ...is instant relief for the victims who now have an efficient means of defending themselves from the robbers and rapists that seek to further exploit the remnants of their shattered lives, said NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre.
[02:08:04.634 --> 02:08:07.755]  Joining Lafayette is inhaling the U.S.
[02:08:07.875 --> 02:08:12.397]  District Court decision with NRA Chief Lobbyist Chris W. Cox.
[02:08:12.717 --> 02:08:15.479]  This is an important victory, but the battle is not over.
[02:08:15.519 --> 02:08:23.802]  The NRA will remedy state emergency statutes in all 50 states if needed to ensure that this injustice does not happen again.
[02:08:23.822 --> 02:08:32.946]  The controversy erupted when the New York Times reported that the New Orleans Superintendent of Police directed that no civilians... Again, that key word, folks...
[02:08:34.187 --> 02:08:41.169]  The authorities told the civilians, that's a martial law nomenclature, words mean things.
[02:08:44.290 --> 02:08:56.913]  The controversy erupted when New York Times reported that the New Orleans Superintendent of Police, under FEMA direction, directed that no civilians in New Orleans will be allowed to have guns and that only law enforcement are allowed to have weapons.
[02:08:56.973 --> 02:09:02.795]  ABC News quoted the New Orleans Deputy Police Chief saying, no one will be able to be armed, we are going to take all the weapons.
[02:09:03.473 --> 02:09:04.254]  That was on TV.
[02:09:04.974 --> 02:09:06.175]  So did Mayor Nagin.
[02:09:07.136 --> 02:09:17.122]  The NRA also pledges it will continue its work to ensure that every single firearm arbitrarily and unlawfully seized under the directive is returned to the rightful law-abiding owner.
[02:09:17.603 --> 02:09:19.084]  Yeah, when hell freezes over.
[02:09:20.485 --> 02:09:21.525]  They didn't give them tags.
[02:09:21.565 --> 02:09:22.866]  They didn't give them records.
[02:09:22.906 --> 02:09:25.168]  They just drug them out by the hair.
[02:09:25.248 --> 02:09:32.633]  I mean, that rich lawyer in a million-dollar house high and dry said, you're not going to get my guns or my dead body, so a bunch of SWAT teams, this is admitted,
[02:09:33.266 --> 02:09:43.208]  Got together, had a big planned operation because somebody dared challenge them, let some looters keep doing what they were doing in the central areas, and went in there and SWAT teamed his hind end.
[02:09:44.208 --> 02:09:46.188]  You don't talk back to us, slave.
[02:09:47.228 --> 02:09:50.709]  And we showed him we got the guns, man, all right!
[02:09:51.109 --> 02:09:52.189]  Yeah!
[02:09:52.749 --> 02:09:54.450]  Yeah, we're scum!
[02:09:57.870 --> 02:10:02.551]  And don't think for a minute these local SWAT teams won't come after your guns the second they tell them.
[02:10:03.433 --> 02:10:06.676]  They'll line up your street and they'll make an example out of some of you.
[02:10:07.077 --> 02:10:13.303]  They'll put it all over the news as they punch a few holes in you and splatter you all over the wall.
[02:10:13.864 --> 02:10:15.286]  Well, they could have been terrorists.
[02:10:15.326 --> 02:10:17.027]  Now get out here and turn them in!
[02:10:17.087 --> 02:10:17.748]  Hands up!
[02:10:18.749 --> 02:10:20.291]  Lay the guns down in front of you!
[02:10:20.331 --> 02:10:21.472]  This is for security!
[02:10:21.852 --> 02:10:24.856]  We don't like doing it, but it's an order and it's to keep you safe.
[02:10:24.896 --> 02:10:26.057]  Now do as you're told!
[02:10:29.719 --> 02:10:33.280]  We've been waiting a long time to let you civilians know you're slaves!
[02:10:35.621 --> 02:10:44.383]  And again, they had the regular army walk right up to San Francisco Chronicle reporters, right in front of a bunch of other major reporters, and say, You know what?
[02:10:45.223 --> 02:10:51.485]  You show one of these dead bodies or any of our operations, and we're going to kill you just... This is in the newspaper.
[02:10:51.565 --> 02:10:53.526]  This is an officer in front of the news, knowing.
[02:10:54.386 --> 02:10:57.287]  We're going to do what we do in Iraq to reporters that get in our way.
[02:10:57.447 --> 02:10:58.287]  We're going to kill you!
[02:10:59.406 --> 02:11:00.266]  Is that understood?
[02:11:02.507 --> 02:11:04.907]  And that officer, they give his name, he's not going to get in any trouble.
[02:11:05.468 --> 02:11:06.628]  That guy's going to be promoted.
[02:11:06.788 --> 02:11:08.668]  You watch, shooting straight to the top, folks.
[02:11:08.688 --> 02:11:09.869]  It's like Shoemaker.
[02:11:10.709 --> 02:11:12.149]  Runs the Waco operation.
[02:11:12.189 --> 02:11:13.309]  They send in Delta Force.
[02:11:13.650 --> 02:11:15.990]  They're all hiding out in a little book suppository building.
[02:11:16.590 --> 02:11:19.391]  A little bitty rock structure inside, concrete structure.
[02:11:19.918 --> 02:11:22.600]  They put a shape charge on there, and boy, I've seen the photos.
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:24.001]  It was splattered.
[02:11:24.341 --> 02:11:25.442]  They didn't burn inside there.
[02:11:25.842 --> 02:11:27.083]  They were blown into bits.
[02:11:27.423 --> 02:11:29.865]  Little dead babies splattered up against walls.
[02:11:31.025 --> 02:11:33.287]  And Delta Force then and others celebrated.
[02:11:33.307 --> 02:11:36.569]  They posed in front of tanks and made big muscles.
[02:11:38.670 --> 02:11:40.372]  Like they'd done something really tough.
[02:11:40.392 --> 02:11:41.412]  There's a stud.
[02:11:42.313 --> 02:11:45.395]  Nothing like killing a 12-month-old baby, a 6-month-old baby.
[02:11:45.945 --> 02:11:47.846]  That's collateral damage, men.
[02:11:49.708 --> 02:11:52.650]  We're all getting double pay for hazard duty.
[02:11:53.350 --> 02:11:54.631]  We're getting a month off.
[02:11:54.651 --> 02:11:56.613]  They're flying us all to go scuba diving.
[02:11:57.373 --> 02:11:58.134]  I later learned this.
[02:11:58.634 --> 02:12:02.497]  We're all getting to go scuba diving in Roatan and Cozumel.
[02:12:02.917 --> 02:12:04.238]  And we're all getting medals.
[02:12:04.498 --> 02:12:05.559]  All right!
[02:12:06.079 --> 02:12:06.519]  Woo-hoo!
[02:12:06.579 --> 02:12:09.121]  Let's go into Dallas to the topless bars.
[02:12:09.582 --> 02:12:10.002]  Man!
[02:12:11.791 --> 02:12:12.612]  Oh, boy.
[02:12:13.132 --> 02:12:14.672]  Nothing like killing children.
[02:12:14.993 --> 02:12:18.074]  Nothing like desecrating America.
[02:12:19.335 --> 02:12:21.575]  And right in the heart of Texas in front of everybody.
[02:12:21.956 --> 02:12:23.116]  Man, look at Shoemaker.
[02:12:23.416 --> 02:12:28.058]  He's shooting up like a rocket after he ordered all this killing.
[02:12:28.118 --> 02:12:29.559]  Good job, Shoemaker.
[02:12:30.940 --> 02:12:35.201]  And the BATF had David Gresh's skull on their desk as a memento.
[02:12:35.221 --> 02:12:35.942]  That's all admitted.
[02:12:35.982 --> 02:12:37.262]  They trotted around.
[02:12:37.282 --> 02:12:38.563]  I mean, they're just a bunch of scum.
[02:12:42.835 --> 02:12:46.358]  Our time to have our way with you is very close.
[02:12:46.738 --> 02:12:49.740]  I mean, that's literally the mentality.
[02:12:51.041 --> 02:12:52.703]  And you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[02:12:54.024 --> 02:12:54.804]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:12:54.844 --> 02:12:57.506]  I mean, we read the reports where these troops are quitting and going public.
[02:12:57.546 --> 02:13:01.429]  Senior people now, where they just sit there for fun and just shoot women.
[02:13:02.090 --> 02:13:04.232]  All right, she's 5,000 yards.
[02:13:05.212 --> 02:13:06.073]  You think you can get her?
[02:13:06.093 --> 02:13:09.836]  Hunter Buck says you can't even get her on the first shot.
[02:13:09.896 --> 02:13:11.117]  A chest shot, head, nothing.
[02:13:12.900 --> 02:13:13.521]  500 bucks.
[02:13:13.661 --> 02:13:15.843]  Even more says you can't hit her in the head.
[02:13:16.043 --> 02:13:17.224]  All right, watch this.
[02:13:17.985 --> 02:13:18.665]  Watch this.
[02:13:19.326 --> 02:13:21.828]  Watch what that kid she's walking with does when this happens.
[02:13:22.568 --> 02:13:23.669]  Let me get a breath.
[02:13:24.450 --> 02:13:25.391]  All right, here we go.
[02:13:27.993 --> 02:13:28.553]  Boom!
[02:13:29.714 --> 02:13:32.016]  Oh, oh, oh, I'm spotting it.
[02:13:32.036 --> 02:13:33.858]  Whoa, did you see that bleeper's head?
[02:13:34.398 --> 02:13:35.859]  Man, you are the best!
[02:13:36.500 --> 02:13:37.501]  Ha, ha, ha!
[02:13:38.982 --> 02:13:40.363]  Just like, you know, we'll go out and
[02:13:41.542 --> 02:13:45.285]  Take an old jug of water and put it up on a fence post at 500 yards away.
[02:13:48.447 --> 02:13:50.108]  These guys do the complete opposite.
[02:13:50.948 --> 02:13:53.170]  They use just women walking in the desert.
[02:13:54.431 --> 02:13:55.752]  Splattering their heads.
[02:13:57.333 --> 02:13:58.874]  That's freedom.
[02:13:58.894 --> 02:14:00.135]  We ought to be proud of that.
[02:14:01.376 --> 02:14:03.997]  Don't you think you reap what you sow, America?
[02:14:04.017 --> 02:14:06.139]  50 million abortions.
[02:14:09.389 --> 02:14:10.669]  Supporting these lies?
[02:14:10.689 --> 02:14:12.750]  You think you just get away with supporting the lie?
[02:14:15.531 --> 02:14:16.971]  You think you get away with it forever?
[02:14:17.031 --> 02:14:18.012]  You don't get away with it.
[02:14:18.172 --> 02:14:19.112]  You never get away with it.
[02:14:19.152 --> 02:14:20.793]  You always pay the piper.
[02:14:21.893 --> 02:14:23.213]  That's the way the world works.
[02:14:26.154 --> 02:14:30.076]  And now there are all these military men that do have souls, and they're going public about it.
[02:14:30.116 --> 02:14:37.678]  I'll never forget during the liberation, they're at the Baghdad Hotel, and BBC reporters and others had just witnessed
[02:14:38.385 --> 02:14:40.006]  The Marines shoot a bunch of little kids.
[02:14:40.046 --> 02:14:41.648]  I mean, little five-year-old kids and stuff.
[02:14:41.688 --> 02:14:42.548]  Just mow them down.
[02:14:43.849 --> 02:14:45.971]  And they just said, you just killed children.
[02:14:47.632 --> 02:14:51.896]  And the Marines started chanting, you bet we kill them little blapers and we're going to kill a lot more.
[02:14:52.216 --> 02:14:53.017]  We love it.
[02:14:59.402 --> 02:15:01.864]  You know, kill a commie for mommy got encouraged.
[02:15:01.984 --> 02:15:04.646]  And that pales in significance.
[02:15:04.666 --> 02:15:06.568]  See, now the Marine Corps cadences...
[02:15:08.075 --> 02:15:12.879]  Throw the candy on the ground, watch the little bastards gather around, mow them down.
[02:15:12.999 --> 02:15:14.940]  I mean, I can't sing the whole song here on air.
[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:16.241]  It's too profane.
[02:15:17.522 --> 02:15:19.464]  But now their chants are about killing children.
[02:15:20.565 --> 02:15:21.465]  What, you're not tough?
[02:15:21.625 --> 02:15:22.546]  What, you don't like it?
[02:15:23.347 --> 02:15:25.448]  I bet you're a piece of... I bet you're a weakling.
[02:15:30.572 --> 02:15:30.993]  I don't know.
[02:15:31.073 --> 02:15:34.976]  Back when Joseph McCarthy was in the Marines, they didn't have chants like that.
[02:15:34.996 --> 02:15:36.737]  I think there were many cases like...
[02:15:38.127 --> 02:15:39.889]  Had a lot more courage than our troops today.
[02:15:41.030 --> 02:15:44.292]  Plus, most of them grew up on farms and ranches and knew how to shoot better.
[02:15:45.133 --> 02:15:49.376]  You just can't find better marksmen than people who start shooting when they're five.
[02:15:50.417 --> 02:15:52.839]  I mean, they didn't have a chance about killing children.
[02:15:54.581 --> 02:15:56.703]  So, I don't know where you get this stuff.
[02:15:56.743 --> 02:15:59.925]  I mean, I don't know what happened to your souls, what happened to you.
[02:16:01.907 --> 02:16:03.068]  But, uh... And then...
[02:16:03.726 --> 02:16:08.512]  Chances are your own government's going to bomb you with an improvised explosive device or shoot you.
[02:16:08.812 --> 02:16:14.379]  Yeah, I mean, MI-60s, Israelis, our own troops, they've all been caught shooting and bombing our own troops.
[02:16:15.721 --> 02:16:16.862]  You're not going to figure that out.
[02:16:18.284 --> 02:16:22.850]  There's people out there that will bury their sons, bury their daughters, and still worship this government.
[02:16:25.859 --> 02:16:36.142]  Because they never read the Bill of Rights, they never read the Constitution, they don't know patriotism is loving the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and fighting corrupt people in government when they become destructive of those aims.
[02:16:37.883 --> 02:16:39.603]  You know, that's in the Declaration of Independence.
[02:16:39.824 --> 02:16:41.124]  I stand with that document.
[02:16:41.544 --> 02:16:43.905]  I stand with the Founding Fathers and our forefathers.
[02:16:45.345 --> 02:16:47.226]  I stand with Marbury v. Madison.
[02:16:48.746 --> 02:16:49.967]  You don't know where you stand.
[02:16:50.388 --> 02:17:01.598]  You, by the way, deep down know this is all true, but you're so afraid that you're going to go find the nearest boot to lick and suck on because you are cowards, first and foremost.
[02:17:03.680 --> 02:17:05.302]  First and foremost, you're cowards.
[02:17:06.262 --> 02:17:08.845]  Well, I'm not a coward, and I'm not afraid.
[02:17:09.739 --> 02:17:14.801]  Of some black ops squad double tapping me in the head or taking me out to some barn and torturing me to death.
[02:17:15.021 --> 02:17:15.561]  I don't care.
[02:17:15.901 --> 02:17:17.462]  I'm more of a man than they'll ever be.
[02:17:17.562 --> 02:17:18.982]  I'm not a cancer.
[02:17:19.562 --> 02:17:20.803]  I don't hurt innocent people.
[02:17:22.083 --> 02:17:24.724]  I don't like exercising power on the weak or the meek.
[02:17:25.805 --> 02:17:27.085]  I stand up against bullies.
[02:17:27.985 --> 02:17:28.946]  And I always will.
[02:17:31.987 --> 02:17:34.508]  I will take it if the new old order ever kills me as a blessing.
[02:17:36.068 --> 02:17:38.449]  Thank you, God, for using me in this fight.
[02:17:39.654 --> 02:17:41.495]  Use me up if that's what you want.
[02:17:41.755 --> 02:17:43.095]  Do it whenever you're ready.
[02:17:46.357 --> 02:17:48.858]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:17:49.538 --> 02:17:54.720]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[02:17:55.632 --> 02:18:02.516]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[02:18:03.577 --> 02:18:12.162]  If so, why is Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[02:18:13.263 --> 02:18:21.228]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.
[02:18:22.717 --> 02:18:24.539]  Just call our toll-free number, 1-800-516-8736.
[02:18:24.559 --> 02:18:24.940]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:25.180]  Call now.
[02:18:25.220 --> 02:18:31.187]  Operators are standing by to receive your order for a free subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[02:18:46.394 --> 02:18:55.458]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:18:55.698 --> 02:19:06.943]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:19:07.263 --> 02:19:12.986]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:19:13.346 --> 02:19:13.907]  We're good to go.
[02:19:37.461 --> 02:19:40.142]  803-4438, that's 888-803-4438, or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:19:40.162 --> 02:19:42.182]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[02:19:42.222 --> 02:19:50.864]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1%, in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:20:04.833 --> 02:20:07.954]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:20:08.214 --> 02:20:09.635]  The bank paid you 1%.
[02:20:09.895 --> 02:20:13.556]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:20:13.816 --> 02:20:15.877]  Here is reality.
[02:20:16.257 --> 02:20:19.859]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:20:20.319 --> 02:20:23.980]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:20:24.541 --> 02:20:27.122]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:20:28.726 --> 02:20:32.449]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[02:20:32.789 --> 02:20:34.291]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:34.331 --> 02:20:34.571]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.268 --> 02:20:49.151]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:20:49.271 --> 02:20:51.032]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[02:20:51.092 --> 02:20:52.353]  But not just any water.
[02:20:52.453 --> 02:20:56.657]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[02:20:56.717 --> 02:21:06.424]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[02:21:06.584 --> 02:21:07.065]  We're good to go.
[02:21:07.105 --> 02:21:07.545]  We're good to go.
[02:21:21.561 --> 02:21:21.881]  Or call 1-866-884-9104.
[02:21:21.901 --> 02:21:22.101]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[02:21:53.274 --> 02:21:58.582]  We've got two callers who are up next, both named John, both from Arkansas.
[02:21:59.222 --> 02:22:00.344]  Too bad one of you hung up.
[02:22:00.384 --> 02:22:03.749]  If you can get back in, I want the other John to call.
[02:22:03.769 --> 02:22:06.753]  We've got two Johns from Arkansas in a row.
[02:22:06.793 --> 02:22:09.297]  They even called in at the same time about 30 minutes ago.
[02:22:10.087 --> 02:22:11.968]  Let's go to that first John in Arkansas.
[02:22:12.028 --> 02:22:15.789]  John in Arkansas, then Bill, Robert, Jim, Elias, and others.
[02:22:15.829 --> 02:22:16.469]  Welcome, John.
[02:22:16.489 --> 02:22:17.530]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:22:17.550 --> 02:22:20.791]  It's an honor and a privilege to talk to you and speak to you.
[02:22:21.011 --> 02:22:21.931]  Well, nice to talk to you.
[02:22:21.971 --> 02:22:22.631]  What's on your mind?
[02:22:22.731 --> 02:22:28.533]  Well, I missed you when you went to London and you did your remote call in and when Jack Wood and Heskin stood in for you.
[02:22:30.034 --> 02:22:31.454]  I missed the chance to talk to you.
[02:22:32.294 --> 02:22:33.095]  Well, welcome, sir.
[02:22:33.115 --> 02:22:33.835]  What's on your mind?
[02:22:33.995 --> 02:22:34.335]  Oh, yeah.
[02:22:34.575 --> 02:22:35.435]  Oh, trust me.
[02:22:35.635 --> 02:22:36.656]  There's a lot on my mind.
[02:22:37.711 --> 02:22:38.611]  Yeah, here's the deal, right?
[02:22:38.971 --> 02:22:41.152]  Everybody's, like, in my state of Arkansas, right?
[02:22:41.172 --> 02:22:42.253]  You know, Little Rock?
[02:22:42.773 --> 02:22:43.033]  Yes, sir.
[02:22:43.053 --> 02:22:47.634]  Everybody's in such a big hurry to welcome these evacuees in from Louisiana and Mississippi.
[02:22:48.495 --> 02:22:55.137]  And they come out, well, we got to do something we can to get them all resettled and get them jobs, stuff like that.
[02:22:55.297 --> 02:22:56.497]  So we don't want them to be homeless.
[02:22:57.017 --> 02:23:03.080]  But in the meantime, they forgot about the other part of the, you know, the scar of the city.
[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:04.360]  These other homeless people.
[02:23:05.208 --> 02:23:06.069]  Oh, I agree with you.
[02:23:06.089 --> 02:23:09.211]  There's going to be more homeless in America as the economy melts down.
[02:23:09.231 --> 02:23:09.411]  Good.
[02:23:09.431 --> 02:23:09.872]  It needs to.
[02:23:35.037 --> 02:23:36.317]  I'll tell you something.
[02:23:36.357 --> 02:23:42.219]  Your forefathers were pioneers that made this country, and the people have gotten soft now.
[02:23:42.499 --> 02:23:43.419]  We didn't cripple their rights.
[02:23:43.719 --> 02:23:44.699]  They're nothing but sheeple.
[02:23:46.660 --> 02:23:47.000]  I know.
[02:23:47.140 --> 02:23:51.301]  I mean, can you believe them openly announcing that Caesar is going to bring his troops into Rome?
[02:23:51.361 --> 02:23:52.742]  I mean, they're actually doing it.
[02:23:53.122 --> 02:23:55.322]  They're announcing troops are going to run your life.
[02:23:55.342 --> 02:23:57.243]  I mean, it's total tyranny.
[02:23:57.863 --> 02:23:59.123]  You mean his lordship?
[02:23:59.703 --> 02:23:59.943]  Yes.
[02:24:00.604 --> 02:24:01.644]  Oh, yeah, his lordship.
[02:24:01.664 --> 02:24:02.024]  We forget it.
[02:24:03.086 --> 02:24:04.507]  But they act like a British lawyer.
[02:24:04.527 --> 02:24:05.587]  They don't act like no president.
[02:24:06.328 --> 02:24:11.011]  Well, they call him His Supreme Excellency when he gives a speech at the U.N.
[02:24:11.251 --> 02:24:17.515]  His Supreme Excellency, the President of the United States, George Walker Bush.
[02:24:17.915 --> 02:24:18.355]  And the U.N.
[02:24:18.375 --> 02:24:19.196]  Representative introduces him.
[02:24:19.216 --> 02:24:23.838]  He kneels his head and goes... They just grovel to power.
[02:24:24.739 --> 02:24:28.121]  Well, let me bring up a case about this hurricane thing.
[02:24:28.421 --> 02:24:31.823]  You know, they said they didn't see this coming, right?
[02:24:34.153 --> 02:24:39.397]  Yes, but FEMA actually had a drill that ended the day Katrina arrived of the exact same thing happening.
[02:24:39.817 --> 02:24:41.198]  Well, let me tell you something, Adam.
[02:24:41.618 --> 02:24:48.863]  You know, Washington, D.C., the District of Criminals, they've got think tanks all across the country that they pay money to to say, hey, come up with a scenario.
[02:24:48.903 --> 02:24:51.805]  One guy said, how about a jar of peanut butter thrown at somebody in a draft room?
[02:24:51.825 --> 02:24:53.986]  Something like that.
[02:24:54.006 --> 02:24:55.928]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:24:55.948 --> 02:24:57.589]  They come up with scenarios all the time.
[02:24:57.609 --> 02:24:58.449]  That's all they do.
[02:24:58.529 --> 02:25:00.190]  No, it's true, yes.
[02:25:00.431 --> 02:25:02.952]  And they throw money at it to see if it could be done.
[02:25:02.972 --> 02:25:03.793]  You know,
[02:25:04.781 --> 02:25:13.447]  I wish there was a lot of stuff I could get on with you to go with you about, but I wrote some articles, right, about, you know, immigration.
[02:25:13.467 --> 02:25:16.389]  We've got a lot of immigration population here, right, from Mexico.
[02:25:16.409 --> 02:25:17.730]  I ain't calling any names.
[02:25:17.830 --> 02:25:19.632]  I'm just getting this.
[02:25:20.172 --> 02:25:25.816]  And when that hurricane thing kicked off in New Orleans, a lot of the illegal immigrants that were there came up here.
[02:25:25.836 --> 02:25:29.139]  So we're also adhering to some of New Orleans' trash.
[02:25:29.159 --> 02:25:32.201]  Ain't trying to legal or green card carry anything.
[02:25:43.091 --> 02:25:49.772]  Well, we can't survive as a country if we just let entire third world populations in, and the globalists are for it.
[02:25:49.793 --> 02:25:50.633]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:51.613 --> 02:25:53.794]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:25:53.834 --> 02:25:57.255]  Let's talk to Bill in Florida.
[02:25:57.295 --> 02:25:58.055]  Bill, welcome.
[02:26:01.536 --> 02:26:02.016]  Yes, Bill.
[02:26:03.604 --> 02:26:08.765]  Bill is busy watering the yard or something, so we'll just let him go.
[02:26:09.686 --> 02:26:11.066]  Robert in South Dakota.
[02:26:11.106 --> 02:26:11.906]  Robert, go ahead.
[02:26:12.786 --> 02:26:14.147]  I love your show, Alex.
[02:26:14.867 --> 02:26:19.628]  The wolves have come to huff-puff and blow down the houses of all these people on the Gulf Coast, obviously.
[02:26:20.228 --> 02:26:30.691]  The hurricanes are obviously stage actors who move in to give everybody the right problem-reaction solution so we can all demand that the Department of Defense takes over with regular troops to run our lives.
[02:26:31.471 --> 02:26:35.914]  Of course, we saw this morning Bush said he's going to monitor the success of this operation from NORTHCOM.
[02:26:36.835 --> 02:26:42.580]  So I called in as I just was watching the news on MSNBC, and they just arrested Cindy Sheehan.
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:44.781]  Are you still there?
[02:26:45.502 --> 02:26:46.623]  So they did arrest her?
[02:26:47.163 --> 02:26:51.726]  Yeah, they arrested her and said, well, she was looking forward to being arrested when she went to the White House.
[02:26:52.527 --> 02:26:54.629]  And the report was on for like 30 seconds.
[02:26:54.669 --> 02:27:00.153]  The report was, well, she went to the gate to ask to see, you know, that audience with the king, Lord Bush.
[02:27:00.774 --> 02:27:07.196]  And after being told to move along, she resisted doing so, and so they had to arrest her.
[02:27:07.476 --> 02:27:08.337]  But she wouldn't move along.
[02:27:08.977 --> 02:27:12.038]  Standing on a public street in Washington, D.C.
[02:27:12.238 --> 02:27:15.139]  is now the biggest crime in fear of the New World Order.
[02:27:15.379 --> 02:27:16.379]  We can't have you doing that.
[02:27:17.239 --> 02:27:17.680]  Stay there.
[02:27:17.700 --> 02:27:18.960]  I want to hear more about this.
[02:27:21.121 --> 02:27:24.342]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, and we'll take all your calls.
[02:27:27.205 --> 02:27:29.007]  Well, we'll get the number out when we get back.
[02:27:29.187 --> 02:27:30.288]  Be sure and visit the website.
[02:27:30.308 --> 02:27:33.410]  It's Infowars.com and Infowars.net.
[02:27:35.992 --> 02:27:36.893]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.373 --> 02:27:38.995]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.895 --> 02:27:42.598]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.797 --> 02:27:54.646]  You know that for nuclear threats and their deadly radiation, the federal government has been openly announcing that it's no longer a matter of if but when.
[02:27:54.926 --> 02:27:57.269]  What you need to know next is, what is happening?
[02:27:57.549 --> 02:27:59.492]  Is your family safe right where you are?

[02:28:18.393 --> 02:28:23.438]  The patented nuke alert has even passed the rigorous military EMP test and has been acquired by the U.S.
[02:28:23.478 --> 02:28:25.540]  military and numerous other government agencies.
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:29.122]  See the keychain-attachable nuke alert at nukealert.com.

[02:29:46.354 --> 02:29:49.876]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon.
[02:29:50.176 --> 02:29:51.537]  A hot dog was a nickel.
[02:29:51.777 --> 02:29:54.278]  And a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[02:29:54.858 --> 02:29:56.179]  What happened to those prices?
[02:29:56.699 --> 02:29:58.400]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[02:29:59.981 --> 02:30:05.964]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[02:30:06.424 --> 02:30:06.964]  The result?
[02:30:07.404 --> 02:30:08.665]  Inflation was born.
[02:30:09.165 --> 02:30:11.246]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[02:30:13.208 --> 02:30:14.091]  What can you do about it?
[02:30:14.532 --> 02:30:16.838]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[02:30:17.671 --> 02:30:23.014]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[02:30:23.454 --> 02:30:28.617]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[02:30:29.057 --> 02:30:31.559]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[02:30:32.019 --> 02:30:37.922]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[02:30:38.402 --> 02:30:40.744]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now.
[02:30:47.014 --> 02:30:52.176]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:52.836 --> 02:30:55.197]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:30:55.217 --> 02:31:09.242]  Yes, Sidney Sheehan was arrested earlier today for protesting the maximum great, dear leader, the fighter pilot ace.
[02:31:10.385 --> 02:31:11.226]  Of Vietnam.
[02:31:11.306 --> 02:31:11.846]  Oh, yes.
[02:31:12.346 --> 02:31:13.507]  He was a fighter race.
[02:31:13.587 --> 02:31:14.688]  I haven't heard that once in the news.
[02:31:15.128 --> 02:31:16.749]  Some say he was a fighter race.
[02:31:16.889 --> 02:31:22.933]  I mean, look at how he looks so good in that military flight uniform.
[02:31:23.433 --> 02:31:25.455]  Well, you know, he is kind of a fighter race.
[02:31:25.715 --> 02:31:26.695]  I saw that on Fox News.
[02:31:27.056 --> 02:31:29.097]  That's why it looks so good on him.
[02:31:29.457 --> 02:31:32.719]  Man, we're really blessed to have a leader like him.
[02:31:33.460 --> 02:31:34.160]  Wow.
[02:31:35.821 --> 02:31:37.042]  But again, he's just a puppet.
[02:31:38.243 --> 02:31:42.867]  They're getting Hillary all lined up in Schwarzenegger, you know, as kind of the second Springer.
[02:31:43.708 --> 02:31:44.508]  And it won't matter.
[02:31:44.628 --> 02:31:45.529]  Hillary's for the war.
[02:31:45.569 --> 02:31:46.850]  Hillary's for all the same stuff.
[02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:47.891]  She's for the police state.
[02:31:49.152 --> 02:31:59.261]  And we saw all the preparations to get rid of Posse Comitatus, the National Guard in the airports, the National Guard on the streets and at the subways, giving you that imprint, that image.
[02:31:59.321 --> 02:32:04.465]  And now, oh, we need regular federal troops to engage in law enforcement.
[02:32:07.285 --> 02:32:12.426]  I mean, even in Rome, the regular army didn't go around carrying out what the city guards did.
[02:32:12.446 --> 02:32:17.267]  I mean, this is just, you want to live in a third world cesspit, you're going to live in one, folks.
[02:32:18.987 --> 02:32:20.408]  They don't teach that in schools, though.
[02:32:20.448 --> 02:32:21.928]  They teach you how to be a mindless idiot.
[02:32:22.388 --> 02:32:27.769]  If you try to talk to the general public, they just sit there and drool at you and go, Did you hear about the football game?
[02:32:28.229 --> 02:32:30.169]  Did you hear about my new iPod?
[02:32:30.910 --> 02:32:32.690]  I'm going on a nice vacation.
[02:32:33.868 --> 02:32:34.008]  Ugh.
[02:32:34.388 --> 02:32:36.130]  George Bush is a conservative.
[02:32:36.190 --> 02:32:37.452]  You are a liberal.
[02:32:38.533 --> 02:32:39.574]  Just mindlessness.
[02:32:40.595 --> 02:32:42.317]  I mean, I'm sorry if I sound really negative today.
[02:32:42.457 --> 02:32:43.699]  I'm just in a bad mood, folks.
[02:32:44.640 --> 02:32:46.902]  Let's go back to Robert in South Dakota.
[02:32:47.323 --> 02:32:51.247]  Robert, finish up what you were saying about our great maximum leader.
[02:32:51.267 --> 02:32:54.071]  Yeah, the early spin on it was that they said...
[02:32:54.605 --> 02:33:08.617]  Well, she was looking forward to being arrested, and then they changed that at the end of the report, saying, well, there was no actual quote from Cindy saying she looked forward to being arrested, but her followers, yeah, now they're her followers, were looking forward to being arrested to make their point.
[02:33:09.018 --> 02:33:16.764]  And these black-booted thugs with brains the size of peas, you know, had to ask, call into the White House, well, is she allowed to see our God King now?
[02:33:17.005 --> 02:33:17.765]  No, she's not.
[02:33:18.106 --> 02:33:20.748]  Well, then arrest her, because she's starting an incident at the gates.
[02:33:21.141 --> 02:33:26.484]  You know, even in the Old Testament, they were allowed to come before the king and beg for an audience for the king at the gate.
[02:33:27.004 --> 02:33:30.026]  And now today, that is just unacceptable, Alex.
[02:33:30.766 --> 02:33:39.932]  Well, actually, in England, 400, 500 years ago, if you had the nerve to go demand an audience for the king, the king had to give you one.
[02:33:40.332 --> 02:33:43.574]  There were big lines every day of people wanting the audience.
[02:33:44.909 --> 02:33:54.403]  Well, they are obviously so terrified of the people seeing this little woman with a dead son go before the maximum leader and beg for an audience that they just...
[02:33:55.137 --> 02:34:00.261]  They're afraid that the whole country is going to stand up and say, Hey, yeah, maybe we can go get an audience with a kid.
[02:34:00.601 --> 02:34:03.464]  No, he's more than the maximum leader.
[02:34:03.524 --> 02:34:06.606]  The supreme commando leader.
[02:34:06.706 --> 02:34:08.828]  Secret Delta Force commander.
[02:34:09.328 --> 02:34:12.571]  Just an incredible... Thanks for the call.
[02:34:13.331 --> 02:34:18.915]  Don't you even talk bad about him and all his little male prostitutes dancing around him.
[02:34:19.976 --> 02:34:20.837]  He's a leader.
[02:34:20.857 --> 02:34:21.978]  Okay?
[02:34:22.598 --> 02:34:23.279]  A leader.
[02:34:24.031 --> 02:34:25.492]  Don't you ever forget it.
[02:34:25.532 --> 02:34:26.653]  He's a commander.
[02:34:27.334 --> 02:34:28.775]  He's a leader of men.
[02:34:28.875 --> 02:34:31.898]  He's a... Jim in Arkansas.
[02:34:31.918 --> 02:34:32.478]  You're on the air.
[02:34:32.518 --> 02:34:32.958]  Go ahead.
[02:34:32.978 --> 02:34:34.680]  That was really funny, Alex.
[02:34:35.561 --> 02:34:36.361]  I agree.
[02:34:36.722 --> 02:34:43.147]  I've been listening to your program for a couple of years now, as well as the others on GCN and the other network, RBN and what have you.
[02:34:43.887 --> 02:34:52.855]  I agree with most of what you and your guests and what a lot of the other folks say regarding the military industrial complex, New World Order and what have you.
[02:34:53.908 --> 02:34:55.429]  I can't support your show, Alex.
[02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:56.490]  I can't promote you.
[02:34:56.971 --> 02:34:59.092]  I've got a copy of your Road to Charity video.
[02:35:00.153 --> 02:35:02.414]  Look, get it out and get it over with, sir, and move along.
[02:35:03.235 --> 02:35:03.695]  Well, sure.
[02:35:04.396 --> 02:35:06.057]  It's your perspective on the environment.
[02:35:06.977 --> 02:35:10.080]  Okay, I'm listening.
[02:35:13.143 --> 02:35:20.068]  I feel like the New World Order and the Military-Industrial Complex like you because you both oppose environmental protection.
[02:35:20.148 --> 02:35:25.451]  The New World Order and the Military-Industrial Complex sees the environment as simply a source of raw materials, what have you.
[02:35:26.172 --> 02:35:28.313]  And I feel like you do, too, to a certain extent.
[02:35:28.814 --> 02:35:32.256]  And absolute private property rights and what have you.
[02:35:32.276 --> 02:35:35.758]  And you refer to environmentalists as just land grabbers.
[02:35:35.778 --> 02:35:36.679]  You write them off.
[02:35:36.739 --> 02:35:41.342]  And you don't allow the people on your show to defend themselves that you disagree with.
[02:35:41.843 --> 02:35:55.203]  I mean, you will allow them if they call in, I suppose, such as you're doing me, but I mean, I'm not seeing you or the Gary Brownfields of the world having people on their show countering all these accusations and what have you that I hear coming out of you guys.
[02:35:55.223 --> 02:35:56.605]  Well, number one, sir...
[02:35:58.712 --> 02:35:59.213]  I did tell him.
[02:36:13.872 --> 02:36:15.373]  Okay, well, they forgot to tell me.
[02:36:16.213 --> 02:36:17.554]  You know, our network is small.
[02:36:17.634 --> 02:36:21.836]  They have them doing too many things, like chopping up the news to put the news on for the next hour.
[02:36:22.297 --> 02:36:25.619]  By that, it comes down off the satellite, and they've got to put the ads in and stuff.
[02:36:25.679 --> 02:36:29.881]  I mean, they've got one guy doing the job of like five people, so that's why they forgot to tell me that.
[02:36:30.241 --> 02:36:31.582]  No problem.
[02:36:31.722 --> 02:36:34.644]  But let me just address this to you right now.
[02:36:35.784 --> 02:36:37.725]  No, no, no.
[02:36:37.765 --> 02:36:38.186]  That's fine.
[02:36:38.206 --> 02:36:41.647]  In fact, put him on hold, because I'm going to have my say first.
[02:36:42.268 --> 02:36:42.388]  Okay?
[02:36:42.408 --> 02:36:42.508]  Okay.
[02:36:43.980 --> 02:36:48.844]  Jim, number one, you out of the gates imply that we censor.
[02:36:50.586 --> 02:36:51.326]  And that's not true.
[02:36:52.867 --> 02:36:55.369]  We ask what your name is and where you're calling from.
[02:36:56.290 --> 02:37:04.757]  And if you say you disagree with us, they're supposed to tell me you're supposed to go to the front of the line.
[02:37:06.919 --> 02:37:08.200]  I was not told you disagreed.
[02:37:09.200 --> 02:37:10.081]  Or perhaps you weren't clear.
[02:37:11.202 --> 02:37:12.243]  But now you're on the air.
[02:37:14.142 --> 02:37:38.562]  And you obviously don't listen very often, because it is admitted that the modern dominant environmental movement is funded by British Petroleum and the Rockefeller Brothers Foundation, Le Pew Charitable Trust, and many others, who openly are funding through the federal government moves
[02:37:40.157 --> 02:37:53.588]  To destroy private property rights where you own 10 acres and you can't build anything on it, retroactively, or where you can't have a fence around your shop to keep the rattlesnakes out because they say that's abusive to the rattlesnakes.
[02:37:53.628 --> 02:37:55.169]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[02:37:55.329 --> 02:38:07.099]  Or the Environmental Protection Agency caught releasing certain types of woodpeckers who have never lived in, say, an area of the Midwest, and then saying, oh, now you can't have cornfields here anymore because we found this woodpecker.
[02:38:08.817 --> 02:38:11.899]  So, I'm not saying there aren't real environmental problems.
[02:38:12.559 --> 02:38:17.862]  And if somebody dumps toxic waste, or somebody does something bad, they can be sued, or they can criminally be charged.
[02:38:19.323 --> 02:38:31.550]  The big environmental movement itself, the moves for global taxation through all of this, and Agenda 21 and all of it, is a system to de-industrialize this country.
[02:38:33.098 --> 02:38:36.000]  I mean, you take the Kyoto Protocol.
[02:38:36.020 --> 02:38:38.462]  160 plus countries have to make zero cuts.
[02:38:38.822 --> 02:38:41.384]  We have to make massive cuts starting the first year at 20%.
[02:38:41.644 --> 02:38:45.687]  Now, folks, our economy is already teetering as it is.
[02:38:46.908 --> 02:38:49.570]  The greenhouse gases we're putting out are a total red herring.
[02:38:49.950 --> 02:39:01.839]  Volcanoes, conservatively, one large eruption will produce, on average, the last big one they had, produced 10 times the gases that cars put out in an entire year.
[02:39:03.194 --> 02:39:05.235]  So I want you to understand that first and foremost.
[02:39:06.435 --> 02:39:15.257]  And so they use these false crises, you know, oh, let's have a tax on fuel, let's have a tax on... when the same people are suppressing new clean energies that are 30 years old.
[02:39:17.238 --> 02:39:26.760]  So I've been to the farmers and ranchers' little 100-acre spreads that have been in the family for over 100 years, and they're taking their land from them, buddy.
[02:39:28.035 --> 02:39:29.075]  Okay, I've been there.
[02:39:29.175 --> 02:39:29.735]  I've seen it.
[02:39:29.795 --> 02:39:30.496]  I've dealt with it.
[02:39:30.836 --> 02:39:47.340]  I've looked at what's happening in New London, Connecticut where people have had land for 150 years, 120 years, three-story homes on the tax rolls at $300,000 and they're getting offered $60,000 because the city condemned it and says we're not even going to pay you just value, not even best price.
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:49.681]  Best value.
[02:39:51.701 --> 02:39:55.042]  And you know, I see this and I deal with this and I look at this every day.
[02:39:55.774 --> 02:39:57.115]  This is nothing but feudalism.
[02:39:57.155 --> 02:40:00.017]  Look up feudalism or serfdom in the encyclopedia.
[02:40:00.057 --> 02:40:03.059]  It's where the lords own all the property and we're the slaves.
[02:40:03.459 --> 02:40:05.981]  And it's a system of control against the population.
[02:40:06.461 --> 02:40:07.302]  Domestication.
[02:40:09.203 --> 02:40:15.367]  So, number one, people who come up with the leverage thing of I won't support your show, I don't want your support.
[02:40:16.968 --> 02:40:21.531]  Listen, I don't want your support, so I won't take it.
[02:40:22.712 --> 02:40:23.873]  Don't listen to my show anymore.
[02:40:24.796 --> 02:40:28.598]  I'm not here to convince you to lick your boots and go through all this with you.
[02:40:29.559 --> 02:40:32.721]  I've dedicated my life to this fight, and it's not about Alex Jones.
[02:40:34.362 --> 02:40:46.930]  If you want to sit there and say that I'm bad and put words in my mouth and say all this, I've talked to the environmentalists, and by and large they're a bunch of well-meaning, bug-eyed idiots.
[02:40:48.190 --> 02:41:13.839]  You can sit there and explain this to them until the cows come home about how big money is behind the current environmental movement, the steel property, that has nothing to do with stopping the chimeras, or that is the multi-species creations they're making in plants and animals, or the open-air growing of these pharmacological crops, or all the things that are going on that are destroying the biosphere right now that are clearly starting to cause even problems with the plankton,
[02:41:14.699 --> 02:41:17.742]  Which could potentially cause a new dark age of death.
[02:41:17.802 --> 02:41:20.985]  I mean, we're talking about major die-off in the ecosystems.
[02:41:21.445 --> 02:41:23.427]  Then it would come back, but it would take thousands of years.
[02:41:23.888 --> 02:41:27.751]  And we're talking about potential mass extinctions and things along these lines.
[02:41:27.851 --> 02:41:29.072]  And yeah, I'm worried about it.
[02:41:30.113 --> 02:41:30.714]  I'm worried about it.
[02:41:31.829 --> 02:41:38.892]  You know, I'm not against charity, but the Red Cross has been caught ripping people off their criminal organization, so is it bad that I say the Red Cross is bad?
[02:41:39.232 --> 02:41:41.774]  I've caught a bunch of criminal environmental groups running scams.
[02:41:41.794 --> 02:41:44.575]  Does that mean that I'm against all environmental groups?
[02:41:44.655 --> 02:41:45.235]  No, it doesn't.
[02:41:46.816 --> 02:41:48.677]  You know, I'm for some animal rights.
[02:41:48.737 --> 02:41:55.480]  I don't think you should torture dogs and cats, and I don't think you should torture a horse, but I think you have the right to put a cat or dog or horse down.
[02:41:55.500 --> 02:41:59.882]  I think a guy who kills a rat that was eating his tomatoes with a club...
[02:42:00.623 --> 02:42:01.364]  Yeah, I'm here, Alex.
[02:42:01.384 --> 02:42:01.964]  You hear me?
[02:42:01.984 --> 02:42:02.645]  Yeah, I hear you.
[02:42:02.705 --> 02:42:03.025]  Go ahead.
[02:42:03.045 --> 02:42:06.368]  Yeah, well, you're making a lot of generalizations as well.
[02:42:06.408 --> 02:42:07.669]  All right, thanks for the call.
[02:42:08.349 --> 02:42:09.270]  Just don't listen.
[02:42:29.344 --> 02:42:31.185]  Is that the only word you got as generalization?
[02:42:31.846 --> 02:42:32.687]  I don't care.
[02:42:32.707 --> 02:42:33.467]  Do you understand?
[02:42:33.487 --> 02:42:37.470]  I don't try to curry favor with people.
[02:42:38.611 --> 02:42:39.411]  Do you understand that?
[02:42:40.973 --> 02:42:42.073]  Okay, you don't like me?
[02:42:42.153 --> 02:42:42.514]  Fine.
[02:42:44.455 --> 02:42:45.296]  It isn't about that.
[02:42:46.136 --> 02:42:47.938]  I'm not trying to be mean here either, folks.
[02:42:48.898 --> 02:42:50.119]  I mean, I've done the studying.
[02:42:50.660 --> 02:42:52.041]  I spend the time doing this.
[02:42:52.561 --> 02:42:53.782]  I know what I'm talking about.
[02:42:54.844 --> 02:43:01.629]  And if you'd have called in with some legitimate thing, like you got this date wrong, or I think you're wrong about that, I would say, okay, I'll check it out.
[02:43:01.669 --> 02:43:04.171]  If I'm wrong, I'll come here and I'll correct myself.
[02:43:04.431 --> 02:43:05.572]  Because I want good information.
[02:43:05.612 --> 02:43:09.675]  But just to say things about me that I didn't say makes me mad.
[02:43:10.995 --> 02:43:11.276]  Okay?
[02:43:12.356 --> 02:43:13.237]  So c'est la vie.
[02:43:13.677 --> 02:43:14.818]  See you in the next life, buddy.
[02:43:14.838 --> 02:43:16.419]  Alright?
[02:43:16.719 --> 02:43:17.760]  See you in heaven, hopefully.
[02:43:20.542 --> 02:43:21.363]  Let's go ahead and...
[02:43:22.438 --> 02:43:25.339]  You think I'm worried about people not supporting me?
[02:43:26.179 --> 02:43:31.660]  I mean, I've been offered a boatload of money to go sell out to the New World Order, and I said no.
[02:43:32.460 --> 02:43:34.641]  And it gets easier each time you say no, folks.
[02:43:35.101 --> 02:43:37.821]  Somebody trying to leverage me when I'm not going to support you.
[02:43:37.841 --> 02:43:38.181]  Good.
[02:43:38.921 --> 02:43:39.202]  Don't.
[02:43:40.102 --> 02:43:41.242]  I care less, buddy.
[02:43:43.222 --> 02:43:45.243]  Let's go ahead and talk to Elias in Michigan.
[02:43:45.283 --> 02:43:46.063]  Elias, go ahead.
[02:43:50.320 --> 02:43:51.041]  That's it for calls.
[02:43:51.081 --> 02:43:52.181]  I'm done with calls for today.
[02:43:52.201 --> 02:43:53.482]  I don't want to take any more.
[02:43:54.603 --> 02:43:59.185]  I've got some news I need to cover that is very, very important here.
[02:44:01.146 --> 02:44:05.609]  It's this attitude in America of caring what other people think about us and being afraid of this or that.
[02:44:05.869 --> 02:44:06.909]  That's why we're slaves.
[02:44:07.690 --> 02:44:09.031]  That's why we're in the position we're in.
[02:44:09.451 --> 02:44:12.973]  Because we care way too much what other people think about us.
[02:44:13.433 --> 02:44:15.714]  I care about the people that love this country.
[02:44:16.175 --> 02:44:18.396]  And I care about the people that are involved and informed.
[02:44:19.153 --> 02:44:21.193]  And I care about the people that stand up for the little guy.
[02:44:23.294 --> 02:44:27.715]  And, you know, frankly, I've just gotten tired of mentioning my words.
[02:44:27.755 --> 02:44:37.817]  There are so many of these patriot or private people I want to expose that have the nerve to talk about me bad every day, and then they're the ones that have got a beam in their eye when I've got a speck in mine.
[02:44:38.837 --> 02:44:40.678]  And I've talked about it.
[02:44:40.698 --> 02:44:42.078]  I mean, I may just expose all of them.
[02:44:42.876 --> 02:44:47.600]  And I've gotten to the point where I'm not going to put up with people's garbage anymore.
[02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:50.743]  You know, I've sacrificed my whole life for this fight, folks.
[02:44:51.503 --> 02:44:53.185]  I mean, almost my every waking hour.
[02:44:53.265 --> 02:44:53.965]  It's crazy.
[02:44:54.866 --> 02:45:00.611]  And I can handle criticism, but I can't handle false criticism.
[02:45:02.232 --> 02:45:04.154]  And I just won't put up with it.
[02:45:05.735 --> 02:45:09.138]  You know, I've got people still sending me emails saying gun confiscation isn't going on.
[02:45:10.825 --> 02:45:12.846]  And I mean, at a certain point, I can't even entertain it.
[02:45:14.848 --> 02:45:17.109]  At a certain point, there's no point in even listening to it.
[02:45:18.930 --> 02:45:20.751]  Because it isn't about Alex Jones, folks.
[02:45:21.231 --> 02:45:22.372]  Let me just give you a newsflash.
[02:45:23.433 --> 02:45:29.376]  There are people that call you animals who want to kill you, and they're building a police state to do it.
[02:45:30.557 --> 02:45:33.159]  With them, it isn't about jet airplanes or money or power.
[02:45:33.179 --> 02:45:34.600]  They've had all that for generations.
[02:45:35.660 --> 02:45:38.162]  For them, it's about the exercise of raw power.
[02:45:39.258 --> 02:45:43.261]  And Henry Kissinger in declassified documents says he wants to kill you and your family.
[02:45:44.503 --> 02:45:44.963]  Okay?
[02:45:45.864 --> 02:45:53.830]  Ted Turner and Prince Philip and Jacques Cousteau and Peter Singer and a hundred other prominent people openly shoot their mouths off about it.
[02:45:54.311 --> 02:45:55.131]  They're doing it.
[02:45:55.612 --> 02:45:57.614]  They're turning America into a police state.
[02:45:57.974 --> 02:46:04.099]  Your children are playing video games where they simulate murdering people and killing patriots and hunting down citizens.
[02:46:04.679 --> 02:46:07.602]  Your troops are doing drills to do it all over the country right now.
[02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:10.301]  Foreign troops are here right now.
[02:46:10.902 --> 02:46:13.024]  They're putting poisons in the food and the water.
[02:46:14.485 --> 02:46:15.906]  You know, all of this is real.
[02:46:16.026 --> 02:46:16.747]  I'm upset.
[02:46:18.008 --> 02:46:19.209]  I'm upset about this.
[02:46:20.390 --> 02:46:21.631]  I'm worried about this.
[02:46:22.952 --> 02:46:24.633]  And people can't shift their paradigm.
[02:46:24.753 --> 02:46:29.057]  Obviously the neocons say that they want to reduce environmental statutes.
[02:46:29.477 --> 02:46:34.601]  That's only any environmental statutes that actually did restrict any of the corporations.
[02:46:34.741 --> 02:46:37.744]  While they expand the statutes that affect the little guys.
[02:46:39.392 --> 02:46:42.233]  You know, it's just people can't see it or they can't get it.
[02:46:42.293 --> 02:46:44.753]  It's either you're for every environmental law or you're for none of them.
[02:46:47.254 --> 02:46:50.895]  And folks, we're not even playing checkers and the other side is playing chess.
[02:46:52.855 --> 02:46:58.037]  And I want to say to the military and the police and everybody out there listening, I mean, you're giving your children hell on earth.
[02:46:58.077 --> 02:46:59.777]  I mean, you're doing something.
[02:47:01.397 --> 02:47:03.338]  You're cutting your nose off to spite your face.
[02:47:06.303 --> 02:47:12.608]  You think by working in the system and serving the system and being part of it, you think by always being a yes man, you move up in the world.
[02:47:12.688 --> 02:47:13.208]  And you don't.
[02:47:14.429 --> 02:47:17.952]  That is a recipe for stagnation and then infection and then death.
[02:47:18.893 --> 02:47:23.356]  You know, these... I was reading, and I'm doing some research for a new film about Satanism.
[02:47:23.516 --> 02:47:24.757]  Satanism is a component of the film.
[02:47:24.777 --> 02:47:29.921]  And I was reading Anton LaVey's Satanic Bible yesterday.
[02:47:31.643 --> 02:47:32.443]  Total scum.
[02:47:32.904 --> 02:47:33.024]  And...
[02:47:34.753 --> 02:47:38.495]  It's all about how, oh, we're good because we're pure and we only care about ourselves.
[02:47:39.055 --> 02:47:41.656]  We're greedy and greed is good and blah, blah, blah.
[02:47:43.037 --> 02:47:46.958]  And again, that's like a cancer saying it's elite because it's taken over the body.
[02:47:48.359 --> 02:47:49.700]  There's nothing elite about it.
[02:47:50.260 --> 02:47:52.221]  It kills the host organism itself.
[02:47:52.401 --> 02:47:53.461]  It kills societies.
[02:47:55.082 --> 02:47:59.624]  And if these guys hadn't had a conscience or a soul left, they couldn't do what they're doing.
[02:47:59.944 --> 02:48:01.965]  It'll make a person who has God in them
[02:48:03.075 --> 02:48:03.375]  Sick.
[02:48:03.475 --> 02:48:04.816]  It'll make you nauseated, folks.
[02:48:04.856 --> 02:48:05.777]  It'll make you want to vomit.
[02:48:06.297 --> 02:48:07.458]  They see that as weakness.
[02:48:07.518 --> 02:48:08.819]  They see it as strength.
[02:48:09.780 --> 02:48:12.962]  That they're able to basically just sit there and cut their own fingers off.
[02:48:13.863 --> 02:48:14.863]  Oh, look, I'm powerful.
[02:48:14.903 --> 02:48:20.787]  I can sit here with a knife like I'm cutting a carrot and just slice little salami slices of my finger off.
[02:48:21.688 --> 02:48:22.549]  That's the New World Order.
[02:48:22.689 --> 02:48:23.589]  Oh, look, we're strong.
[02:48:23.930 --> 02:48:25.771]  We can stick our hand in this blast furnace.
[02:48:28.356 --> 02:48:30.901]  I mean, they're just weak, diseased cowards.
[02:48:31.502 --> 02:48:33.706]  Being a coward is the start of evil, folks.
[02:48:33.746 --> 02:48:36.050]  When you start giving in to evil, it's because you're a coward.
[02:48:37.212 --> 02:48:40.138]  All right, we'll come back and hit some final news in the final segment.
[02:48:40.158 --> 02:48:40.519]  Stay with us.
[02:48:45.524 --> 02:48:47.065]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.245 --> 02:48:50.329]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.469 --> 02:48:54.373]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.413 --> 02:48:58.658]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:58.998 --> 02:49:02.782]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:02.902 --> 02:49:04.644]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:04.884 --> 02:49:08.205]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:49:08.245 --> 02:49:12.947]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.107 --> 02:49:16.168]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:49:16.328 --> 02:49:19.189]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:19.690 --> 02:49:25.812]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.332 --> 02:49:28.434]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:49:46.659 --> 02:49:57.937]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[02:49:58.157 --> 02:50:01.643]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[02:50:01.823 --> 02:50:02.103]  I think?
[02:50:23.024 --> 02:50:29.970]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[02:50:30.171 --> 02:50:34.134]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:34.194 --> 02:50:36.817]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:36.837 --> 02:50:38.058]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.095 --> 02:50:52.044]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:52.264 --> 02:50:54.507]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:54.708 --> 02:51:01.077]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[02:51:01.397 --> 02:51:02.038]  We're good to go.
[02:51:21.636 --> 02:51:22.256]  We're good to go.
[02:51:54.346 --> 02:51:55.988]  I'm honored to be your host.
[02:51:56.048 --> 02:51:59.290]  I'm thankful for all the affiliates and sponsors and listeners.
[02:52:00.371 --> 02:52:02.893]  I just am depressed about the state of this country.
[02:52:04.114 --> 02:52:05.335]  I should be more positive.
[02:52:05.375 --> 02:52:07.016]  People really are waking up right now.
[02:52:07.036 --> 02:52:08.337]  There's a lot of good things happening.
[02:52:08.357 --> 02:52:09.738]  There's still a lot of good out there.
[02:52:10.819 --> 02:52:14.542]  I'm just so thankful for all the things that God has provided for us.
[02:52:15.643 --> 02:52:16.083]  It's just...
[02:52:18.777 --> 02:52:21.659]  Hearing a bunch of bull gets really old.
[02:52:23.500 --> 02:52:30.626]  And, you know, sniveling tones in people's voices and all of it just makes me sick.
[02:52:31.906 --> 02:52:36.550]  And maybe I'm taking my anger out on the caller like the one earlier.
[02:52:38.371 --> 02:52:41.633]  Because I'm angry about them openly announcing me in deposit commentatus.
[02:52:43.415 --> 02:52:46.457]  It just seems no matter what we do, they're going to go ahead with what they're going to do.
[02:52:46.517 --> 02:52:47.798]  And I'm just sad.
[02:52:49.648 --> 02:52:55.851]  Now, we need to keep waking people up, because as they carry out their process, the resistance will only grow, and we're going to win this fight.
[02:52:56.771 --> 02:53:00.153]  But slavery isn't freedom, and I don't know how I'm supposed to explain that to people.
[02:53:00.813 --> 02:53:03.534]  But slavery doesn't deliver freedom or security or anything.
[02:53:03.974 --> 02:53:04.915]  It delivers slavery.
[02:53:05.575 --> 02:53:09.877]  Bill would permit DNA collection from all those arrested, suspects arrested or detained.
[02:53:10.675 --> 02:53:12.476]  The other one goes to a federal database.
[02:53:12.496 --> 02:53:12.896]  That's public.
[02:53:12.916 --> 02:53:14.056]  See, they don't ask you folks.
[02:53:14.076 --> 02:53:14.716]  They start doing it.
[02:53:40.120 --> 02:53:41.521]  Then they announced it decades later.
[02:53:43.842 --> 02:53:47.463]  In one year, Halliburton stock doubles as troops' deaths double.
[02:53:47.763 --> 02:53:48.604]  Halliburton watch.
[02:53:49.264 --> 02:53:56.827]  Since the beginning of the war, Halliburton, the Texas energy giant, once headed by Vice President Dick Cheney, has seen its stock price more than triple in value.
[02:53:57.347 --> 02:53:57.947]  When the U.S.
[02:53:58.007 --> 02:54:02.369]  invaded Iraq in March of 2003, Halliburton stock was selling for $20 per share.
[02:54:02.389 --> 02:54:04.930]  Today, that stock is at $66 a share.
[02:54:07.006 --> 02:54:10.767]  And again, it's doubled in value just in the last year.
[02:54:10.867 --> 02:54:12.827]  Most of that growth just in the last year.
[02:54:13.408 --> 02:54:18.269]  Also, the number of troops has doubled to right at 2,000, and it's a lot higher than that.
[02:54:20.189 --> 02:54:27.191]  And Halliburton will get to stay there a long time because our government's carrying out most of the terror attacks.
[02:54:27.651 --> 02:54:30.032]  Hillary Clinton wants to restrict the Internet.
[02:54:30.072 --> 02:54:31.532]  Grudge has this from one of her speeches.
[02:54:32.532 --> 02:54:40.638]  And she said, we've got to do something to impose new media restrictions to stop Internet reports of sexual impropriety.
[02:54:41.298 --> 02:54:45.681]  You can go read the quotes of that at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[02:54:45.781 --> 02:54:46.642]  Big story here.
[02:54:46.682 --> 02:54:51.365]  Could have spent all day on it, but it's just the new criminologist magazine picking up on it.
[02:54:51.425 --> 02:54:53.447]  London bomber mastermind was working for MI6.
[02:54:54.795 --> 02:54:55.996]  It's always the same story.
[02:54:56.036 --> 02:54:56.737]  And then the U.S.
[02:54:56.857 --> 02:54:59.018]  Army plans to buy bulk anthrax.
[02:54:59.038 --> 02:54:59.799]  The U.S.
[02:54:59.819 --> 02:55:08.286]  military wants to buy large quantities of anthrax, a controversial move that is likely to raise questions over its commitment to treaties designed to limit the spread of biological weapons.
[02:55:08.326 --> 02:55:09.547]  Well, under U.S.
[02:55:09.607 --> 02:55:11.228]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1000...
[02:55:13.266 --> 02:55:13.687]  Under U.S.
[02:55:13.727 --> 02:55:20.557]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B, they authorize you to use it lethally on us.
[02:55:20.677 --> 02:55:21.318]  And they did.
[02:55:21.859 --> 02:55:25.664]  Back after 9-11, Bush was on Cipro and their boys launched an anthrax attack.
[02:55:26.606 --> 02:55:29.550]  We even know the name of the person in the Senate out of Fort Detrick.
[02:55:31.544 --> 02:55:33.345]  We are out of time, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:55:33.385 --> 02:55:35.025]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight central.
[02:55:35.065 --> 02:55:37.526]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2 central.
[02:55:37.586 --> 02:55:41.348]  As we tell you the awful truth, as we lance the wound.
[02:55:42.008 --> 02:55:44.249]  Try to get the pus out of there.
[02:55:44.269 --> 02:55:45.709]  I'm sorry, but that's what we do here.
[02:55:47.170 --> 02:55:48.790]  Exposing it is a big part of it.
[02:55:48.830 --> 02:55:51.031]  Sunshine is a way of disinfecting this stuff.
[02:55:51.571 --> 02:55:55.813]  We can turn the corner, but it's going to take standing up and staying focused.
[02:55:57.027 --> 02:56:01.249]  None of us agree on every point, but I think we do agree that we don't want to be a police state martial law country.
