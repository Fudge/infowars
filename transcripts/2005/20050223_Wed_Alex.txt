[00:00:05.647 --> 00:00:06.288]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.949 --> 00:00:08.010]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.831]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:11.293]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:12.954]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.974 --> 00:00:17.278]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.799 --> 00:00:21.883]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:33.523]  Well, my friends, it is Wednesday, the 23rd day of February 2005.
[00:00:34.023 --> 00:00:36.565]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:41.728]  We'll be live for the next three hours, and we're going to have wide-open phones.
[00:00:41.748 --> 00:00:44.089]  We're going to go to your calls coming up in the next segment.
[00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:55.176]  Any issue, any news item, any question, any comment, you want to rant and rave at me, you want to tell me I'm wrong, you want to verbally punch me in the nose, you want to agree with me, whatever!
[00:00:55.956 --> 00:00:58.178]  Zero censorship, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:58.198 --> 00:01:03.282]  We've got the First Amendment here, live and well, because we can defend our ideas.
[00:01:03.862 --> 00:01:11.889]  We don't interrogate you for a half hour before you get on air, like the neocons, the liberals and conservative clothing do.
[00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.092]  Mars pictures reveal frozen sea.
[00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:22.998]  A huge frozen sea lies just below the surface of Mars, a team of European scientists has announced.
[00:01:23.058 --> 00:01:25.500]  Very interesting scientific announcement.
[00:01:26.645 --> 00:01:29.346]  That we'll be covering a little bit later.
[00:01:29.466 --> 00:01:31.026]  Some sad news, of course.
[00:01:31.586 --> 00:01:39.968]  Judge could order, will order, the fate of Terri Schiavo today.
[00:01:41.928 --> 00:01:49.810]  Of course, the Supreme Court said they can remove her feeding tube and let this woman, who looks at you and can smile at you, let her die.
[00:01:50.416 --> 00:01:58.418]  Despite the fact that there's been a lot of evidence of foul play and how she got paralyzed from the neck down over a decade ago.
[00:01:58.478 --> 00:02:00.638]  We've had the family on many times and have fought this.
[00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.580]  She's really a poster child for the eugenics crowd that want the precedent to kill us.
[00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.820]  So we'll get into that.
[00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:11.661]  I feel like I know this poor dear lady.
[00:02:11.681 --> 00:02:15.542]  You can go to their website and watch her smile and laugh at her mother and
[00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.013]  They've unplugged her before, taken her food away for a week before, which is extremely painful for her.
[00:02:23.094 --> 00:02:25.215]  She basically begs for food.
[00:02:26.055 --> 00:02:28.136]  But this is your government.
[00:02:29.757 --> 00:02:45.847]  And ever since the estranged husband got the money, the settlement, and got the family to sign over rights when he was acting all friendly and good, you won't even let him brush her teeth or give her any type of medical care, the poor dear thing, when she gets infections.
[00:02:47.103 --> 00:02:48.664]  He won't give her treatment.
[00:02:48.704 --> 00:02:52.887]  It's been torture for her over these years.
[00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:57.710]  It's just horrible what they've done to her.
[00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:03.934]  In fact, she was coming out of it ten years ago, but that's when they ordered that the food and things be taken away from her.
[00:03:04.094 --> 00:03:07.736]  That is letting her eat Jell-O and letting her get her teeth worked on and things like that.
[00:03:08.097 --> 00:03:09.277]  She's gotten worse and worse.
[00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.040]  Michael Cockroach Shivo is just a real piece of work.
[00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:16.282]  More on that coming up.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.740]  U.S.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.321]  drug czar likens fighting drugs to terror.
[00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:20.721]  Yes.
[00:03:21.541 --> 00:03:22.982]  Everything is terrorism now.
[00:03:23.022 --> 00:03:24.962]  Having some marijuana is terrorism.
[00:03:25.602 --> 00:03:27.223]  It's all about catching us in the net.
[00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:37.846]  Meanwhile, this is out of the Houston Chronicle, Mexican assassins invading Texas and committing murders all over the state.
[00:03:38.506 --> 00:03:40.166]  But the government isn't too worried about that.
[00:03:40.186 --> 00:03:41.207]  They're worried about this.
[00:03:41.227 --> 00:03:42.467]  Border Patrol...
[00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:44.644]  New threat.
[00:03:44.764 --> 00:03:52.387]  Civilian Minutemen to patrol Arizona border to Kirby Legal Immigration Crossings and the Border Patrol is calling them their enemy.
[00:03:54.327 --> 00:04:00.850]  I guess because they're not like the Mexican troops that have shot and killed Border Patrol or the drug dealers that shoot and kill Border Patrol and FBI agents.
[00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:04.311]  I guess because they're trying to help them, that's why they're bad.
[00:04:05.211 --> 00:04:07.532]  But we've had Mr. Simcox on before.
[00:04:07.552 --> 00:04:08.492]  We're going to get him back on.
[00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.173]  Heading up the group that's doing this with hundreds.
[00:04:11.798 --> 00:04:13.379]  Nearly 500 volunteers.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.841]  There's nothing more patriotic than what they're doing, so we'll tell that.
[00:04:19.402 --> 00:04:24.824]  Also, Bush and German leader share the same goal in Iran, the Associated Press is reporting.
[00:04:25.765 --> 00:04:28.186]  Syrian minister warns of Bush plot.
[00:04:28.206 --> 00:04:29.727]  We'll tell you what they say that plot is.
[00:04:30.127 --> 00:04:32.588]  Pakistani army to shoot at intruding, quote, U.S.
[00:04:32.628 --> 00:04:33.028]  forces.
[00:04:33.568 --> 00:04:35.329]  I thought Pakistan was our ally.
[00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.751]  The Pope likens abortion to the Holocaust.
[00:04:39.617 --> 00:04:42.380]  Interpol sounds bioterror alarm.
[00:04:44.182 --> 00:04:44.943]  And a U.S.
[00:04:44.983 --> 00:04:47.626]  terror suspect was tortured by Saudis.
[00:04:48.227 --> 00:04:51.511]  American citizens being tortured, and that's A-OK with our government.
[00:04:52.452 --> 00:04:53.673]  There is so much coming up.
[00:04:53.713 --> 00:04:55.015]  You don't want to miss this broadcast.
[00:04:55.535 --> 00:04:57.257]  Infowars.com is the website.
[00:04:57.277 --> 00:04:57.678]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.357 --> 00:05:08.224]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.505 --> 00:05:09.906]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:12.289]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.531]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:19.756]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:20.077 --> 00:05:24.121]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:24.762]  We're good to go.
[00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:39.898]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:05:39.938 --> 00:05:40.419]  That's 888-2533-139.

[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:43.340]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[00:06:02.313 --> 00:06:03.334]  The war on terrorism.
[00:06:03.675 --> 00:06:06.458]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:06.718 --> 00:06:10.882]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.303 --> 00:06:12.144]  So what do you do?
[00:06:12.464 --> 00:06:17.049]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.612]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.112 --> 00:06:34.821]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallouts, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:41.925]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:42.265 --> 00:06:46.672]  Get this critical video every American needs for only $29 plus shipping.

[00:08:06.974 --> 00:08:08.054]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.734 --> 00:08:09.855]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.495 --> 00:08:11.355]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:12.955]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:17.376]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.836 --> 00:08:21.957]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.778 --> 00:08:25.758]  All right, my friends, down to the second segment.
[00:08:25.858 --> 00:08:33.940]  Eight minutes into this first hour of worldwide broadcast against tyranny in defense of the Second Amendment and national sovereignty.
[00:08:35.965 --> 00:08:41.790]  Family values, all the things that are under attack more than ever under Lord Bush's tutelage.
[00:08:43.332 --> 00:08:44.453]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:08:44.473 --> 00:08:48.857]  The websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:08:49.257 --> 00:08:53.681]  InfoWars, because we're in an information war, a war on for your mind.
[00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:57.185]  That's where the battles are being fought, won, or lost.
[00:08:58.005 --> 00:09:00.548]  And because the globalists, the New World Order crowd...
[00:09:01.633 --> 00:09:06.354]  Are building a worldwide prison control grid, hence PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:09:06.834 --> 00:09:08.615]  We're going to go to your calls in this first segment.
[00:09:08.635 --> 00:09:10.215]  Toll free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:12.456 --> 00:09:15.596]  Charles, Patrick, John, Eric, and others, your calls are coming up.
[00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:22.638]  Terry Shivo Schindler is to be unplugged today.
[00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:25.319]  And she's not in a coma.
[00:09:26.079 --> 00:09:30.440]  And there's been a lot of evidence of foul play in how she got in this paralyzed position.
[00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.344]  And it's been quite a saga.
[00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:39.645]  And they've taken her feeding tube and her water away before for seven, eight days.
[00:09:40.646 --> 00:09:42.486]  And we'll see what happens.
[00:09:42.806 --> 00:09:44.827]  We'll get a little bit into that.
[00:09:45.307 --> 00:09:50.548]  Just a really sad case for the pro-death crowd out there that keeps promoting this.
[00:09:51.108 --> 00:09:52.289]  As I mentioned earlier, the U.S.
[00:09:52.349 --> 00:09:56.290]  drug czars liken fighting drugs to the war on terror.
[00:09:57.327 --> 00:09:59.269]  But it's just like the war on terror.
[00:09:59.809 --> 00:10:05.535]  Criminal elements of our government, if they've been caught many times, are behind the predominant drug shipments into this country.
[00:10:05.555 --> 00:10:12.001]  The people that get busted are the cowboys not paying their cut into the CIA-controlled cartels.
[00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:23.343]  And then the cartels themselves, in many cases, own our private prisons, and when your child gets caught using drugs, the drug dealers put your child in the prison they own.
[00:10:23.363 --> 00:10:38.446]  Then the moron public cheers, yeah, make them prisoners work, not knowing that competing against millions of people in prison working for 20 cents an hour is making all the rest of us lose our jobs and driving down the wages.
[00:10:39.958 --> 00:10:43.019]  Meanwhile, Mexican assassins are invading Texas.
[00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:46.641]  This is in the Houston Chronicle today.
[00:10:46.701 --> 00:10:48.602]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:10:49.442 --> 00:11:03.928]  At least three drug-related slayings in North Texas are being blamed on a team of rogue Mexican commandos accused of orchestrating dozens of murders along the U.S.-Mexico border, raising fears that the drug war is moving north.
[00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:07.510]  Now in Dallas and other North Texas towns...
[00:11:08.976 --> 00:11:16.522]  There have been murders of people like Matthew Frank and Brandon Galgaos and many others.
[00:11:17.943 --> 00:11:25.249]  Their bodies have been found in burning sport utility vehicles after being machine-gunned by the Special Forces troops.
[00:11:25.889 --> 00:11:35.377]  These are the same troops my father's a dentist, and he told me the story of the, let's just say, as high as you get in the Texas Border Patrol,
[00:11:36.952 --> 00:11:39.314]  The head border patrol agent for Texas is one of his patients.
[00:11:40.896 --> 00:11:43.478]  And my dad said, Is it hard to tell the story?
[00:11:43.518 --> 00:11:44.519]  He said, Oh, yeah, it is.
[00:11:44.599 --> 00:11:45.460]  This is years ago.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:52.586]  But he said that, yeah, there are bounties on their heads by the Mexican troops, by the Mexican government.
[00:11:53.106 --> 00:11:54.848]  And that's even been in some Mexican newspapers.
[00:11:54.928 --> 00:12:02.695]  And I don't know what they've killed, like four border patrol agents the last two years, shot a bunch of cops, killed a bunch of forestry agents.
[00:12:04.958 --> 00:12:06.359]  Tortured FBI agents.
[00:12:06.499 --> 00:12:12.441]  And man, then patriots go down there on the border and try to night vision it and report it and shoot video of it for the news.
[00:12:12.961 --> 00:12:14.602]  And the police will come, arrest them.
[00:12:15.242 --> 00:12:20.525]  If they find a firearm in their car, even though it's Arizona or Texas where you're allowed to have it, they'll take you to jail.
[00:12:21.105 --> 00:12:23.926]  I mean, the cops will actually just... It's incredible.
[00:12:23.946 --> 00:12:27.067]  They're like, how dare you try to stop us from being killed.
[00:12:28.308 --> 00:12:28.988]  I'm not joking.
[00:12:29.088 --> 00:12:30.429]  I mean, it's really bad.
[00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:40.283]  And so now, there's been dozens of murders along the border, and in just the last few months, at least three murders around the Dallas area.
[00:12:42.381 --> 00:12:56.104]  It says, Dallas and federal officials say 8 to 10 Zetas, former members of the Mexican Army who defected to Mexico's Gulf drug cartel in the late 1990s, have been operating in North Texas since 2003.
[00:12:56.184 --> 00:12:58.624]  The Dallas Morning News reported today.
[00:12:58.644 --> 00:13:01.985]  The Zetas are accused of fatally shooting, and it goes through a bunch of that.
[00:13:02.645 --> 00:13:07.506]  Blowing up cars, machine gun people, just a lot of fun, basically.
[00:13:08.486 --> 00:13:09.706]  And then here's another one.
[00:13:10.339 --> 00:13:12.081]  Again, don't worry about these guys.
[00:13:12.561 --> 00:13:17.206]  Here's the Associated Press out of Arizona.
[00:13:18.287 --> 00:13:20.188]  Border Patrol's new threat.
[00:13:20.228 --> 00:13:26.114]  Civilian minute men to patrol Arizona border to curb illegal immigrant crossings.
[00:13:27.615 --> 00:13:27.895]  U.S.
[00:13:27.955 --> 00:13:37.118]  officials charged with securing Arizona's vulnerable border from illegal immigrant crossings are bracing for what they call a potential new threat, the Minutemen.
[00:13:37.678 --> 00:13:50.121]  Nearly 500 volunteers have already joined the Minutemen project, anointing themselves civilian border patrol agents determined to stop the immigration flow that routinely and easily sweeps past federal authorities.
[00:13:50.729 --> 00:14:02.046]  They plan to patrol a 40 mile or 64 kilometer stretch of the southeast Arizona state border throughout April when the tide of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border peaks.
[00:14:03.147 --> 00:14:04.029]  And all they're going to do
[00:14:04.995 --> 00:14:12.578]  On several private ranches right on the border where there have been rapes and arson attacks and robberies and vandalism.
[00:14:12.878 --> 00:14:16.300]  We've shown the video on my TV show locally that's been shot at these ranches.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:20.301]  I mean, houses being burned down, rapes, robberies.
[00:14:20.361 --> 00:14:22.202]  I mean, it's like the wild, wild west.
[00:14:22.802 --> 00:14:30.005]  In this one county, Cochise County, over a million and a half illegals go across and about a half million go back each year.
[00:14:31.366 --> 00:14:32.606]  Piles of garbage.
[00:14:32.666 --> 00:14:33.887]  I mean, two feet high.
[00:14:34.628 --> 00:14:35.448]  Just everywhere.
[00:14:35.568 --> 00:14:42.170]  Water jugs and, you know, just bag, chip bags and human excrement everywhere.
[00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:44.831]  And it's just, it's hell on earth.
[00:14:45.551 --> 00:14:46.271]  Hell on earth.
[00:14:47.872 --> 00:14:57.574]  And so they're going to put people, and they've already built some observation towers on this private property, and if people trespass, they're going to hold them there and call the Border Patrol.
[00:14:59.275 --> 00:15:00.275]  Oh, how evil!
[00:15:01.335 --> 00:15:03.336]  And we've had other cases in South Texas where
[00:15:04.545 --> 00:15:13.809]  Where they got video of some of the foreign troops, which was even in the newspaper, and then the police chief down there admitted that, was it Jim Hogg County?
[00:15:13.829 --> 00:15:16.470]  Yes, we really have places called Jim Hogg County.
[00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:17.431]  Talk about Boss Hogg.
[00:15:18.191 --> 00:15:22.973]  Down there, it was the sheriff, and he admitted the other foreign troops all over the place.
[00:15:23.033 --> 00:15:23.954]  I mean, not just Mexican.
[00:15:24.614 --> 00:15:27.455]  There's Chinese, you name it.
[00:15:28.016 --> 00:15:31.097]  But then he got some type of federal order, and they were down on a ranch,
[00:15:32.034 --> 00:15:36.296]  And luckily there was a French film crew there, professional TV crew covering all this.
[00:15:37.097 --> 00:15:39.678]  So these two illegal aliens come across.
[00:15:39.698 --> 00:15:41.239]  Later it turned out it was all staged.
[00:15:41.799 --> 00:15:44.480]  And it was cold, so they give them blankets and tell them to sit down.
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:47.322]  And in drives the Border Patrol.
[00:15:48.382 --> 00:15:52.044]  And they're with kind of a Southern Poverty Law Center type individual.
[00:15:52.604 --> 00:15:56.146]  And the illegals go and say, oh, they beat us.
[00:15:56.286 --> 00:15:57.567]  And so they go and all arrest them.
[00:15:58.490 --> 00:16:03.312]  It's just anything to stop the American people from even defending their own property.
[00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:08.234]  So, um... It's amazing.
[00:16:09.074 --> 00:16:19.758]  I felt the only way to get something done was to do it yourself, said Jim Gilchrist, a retired accountant and decorated Vietnam War veteran who was helping recruit men and men across the country.
[00:16:20.598 --> 00:16:26.621]  We've been repeatedly accused of being people who are taking the law into our own hands, said Gilchrist, 56...
[00:16:28.937 --> 00:16:29.718]  ...of California.
[00:16:29.738 --> 00:16:32.019]  This is outright bogus statement.
[00:16:32.059 --> 00:16:34.501]  We are going down there to assist law enforcement.
[00:16:35.721 --> 00:16:41.545]  Officials concede the 370-mile Arizona border is the most porous stretch on the U.S.-Mexico line.
[00:16:41.885 --> 00:16:47.429]  Moreover, recent intelligence shows that Al-Ciada are likely to enter the country through the Mexico border.
[00:16:47.889 --> 00:16:51.512]  James Loy, the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Department, said last week.
[00:16:54.173 --> 00:16:55.014]  But that doesn't matter.
[00:16:55.074 --> 00:16:58.076]  By the way, we have at least 2,000 less Border Patrol...
[00:17:00.285 --> 00:17:02.286]  In the southern sector alone.
[00:17:04.687 --> 00:17:06.067]  Now that's the government's own admission.
[00:17:06.207 --> 00:17:08.228]  And I've had the head of the Border Patrol Union on.
[00:17:08.628 --> 00:17:09.708]  He says the numbers are worse.
[00:17:09.788 --> 00:17:11.389]  And he says, quote, it's a new world order.
[00:17:11.689 --> 00:17:13.730]  It's about the takeover of America, we've been told.
[00:17:14.690 --> 00:17:16.631]  I mean, I've had the head of the Border Patrol on.
[00:17:16.911 --> 00:17:18.491]  I mean, the head of the Border Patrol Union on.
[00:17:19.372 --> 00:17:20.832]  I've had other Border Patrol agents on.
[00:17:21.593 --> 00:17:23.213]  And they are just sitting ducks out there.
[00:17:24.314 --> 00:17:28.435]  And they've all gone basically to be air marshals where they get more money.
[00:17:29.133 --> 00:17:30.254]  And they're not hiring more people.
[00:17:30.274 --> 00:17:33.617]  They funded some of it with the National ID Card Bill to get you to go along with it.
[00:17:33.837 --> 00:17:35.458]  And then Ridge said, nope, we're taking that money.
[00:17:36.579 --> 00:17:39.261]  And Alberto Gonzalez and Chertoff are going to be even worse.
[00:17:39.641 --> 00:17:41.543]  Charles in Wisconsin, thanks for holding.
[00:17:41.583 --> 00:17:42.023]  Go ahead.
[00:17:42.543 --> 00:17:43.724]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:17:43.784 --> 00:17:44.345]  I'm on the cell phone.
[00:17:44.365 --> 00:17:45.185]  How are you hearing me?
[00:17:45.466 --> 00:17:45.706]  Good.
[00:17:45.746 --> 00:17:46.326]  Loud and clear.
[00:17:46.767 --> 00:17:47.147]  Excellent.
[00:17:47.547 --> 00:17:52.571]  I heard your George Norrie interview two or three weeks ago, a couple hours you spent on the radio with George.
[00:17:52.791 --> 00:17:53.031]  Yes.
[00:17:53.652 --> 00:17:56.434]  That was one of the best radio interviews I've ever heard in my life.
[00:17:57.335 --> 00:17:58.856]  And I was wondering, did you film that?
[00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:00.990]  No, I didn't.
[00:18:01.010 --> 00:18:05.133]  I was invited down to speak at the talk fest with George.
[00:18:05.693 --> 00:18:16.380]  He was invited enough to invite me the next day, live on the radio locally, and I brought a little rinky-dink camera of my own and set it up, and I put about 15 minutes of that at prisonplanet.tv.
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:18.821]  Second thing, thank you, thank you.
[00:18:19.181 --> 00:18:22.123]  Second thing, yesterday you had a Dr. Frank from Canada.
[00:18:22.784 --> 00:18:24.605]  That was the... Canada, yes.
[00:18:24.785 --> 00:18:27.667]  Yeah, Winnipeg legislature...
[00:18:28.732 --> 00:18:34.435]  Historian that was talking about all the Masonic, occultic, and satanic emblems he found in the building.
[00:18:35.395 --> 00:18:36.876]  I tried to call... Go ahead.
[00:18:37.336 --> 00:18:39.737]  Yes, that's been all over the major newspapers, yes.
[00:18:40.218 --> 00:18:40.878]  I tried to call in.
[00:18:40.918 --> 00:18:42.579]  I was pretty late in the game.
[00:18:42.639 --> 00:18:51.183]  But every door that we walk through in this country, residential and most commercial doors, like 99% of commercial doors, are 6 foot 8 inches rough opening.
[00:18:51.643 --> 00:18:53.584]  That translates decimal into 6.66.
[00:18:53.904 --> 00:18:54.905]  So it's everywhere.
[00:18:56.547 --> 00:18:58.749]  Well, did you hear him talk about how the rooms are 666?
[00:18:59.149 --> 00:19:01.971]  I mean, it's just everything.
[00:19:02.532 --> 00:19:03.232]  Exactly, I did.
[00:19:03.252 --> 00:19:05.874]  It just reinforces everything I've come to believe.
[00:19:05.894 --> 00:19:08.016]  There was one other point.
[00:19:08.796 --> 00:19:09.477]  Oh, yeah.
[00:19:09.997 --> 00:19:11.918]  Years I've spent passing out tapes.
[00:19:11.998 --> 00:19:15.501]  I first did it anonymously in videos, you and Dave both.
[00:19:16.261 --> 00:19:19.103]  And I found one of the easiest things to do anymore.
[00:19:19.143 --> 00:19:20.404]  I'm not having any resistance.
[00:19:20.464 --> 00:19:21.425]  I'm having people take them.
[00:19:21.505 --> 00:19:25.028]  In fact, I can't keep my own copies up enough.
[00:19:25.268 --> 00:19:25.448]  But I...
[00:19:26.818 --> 00:19:32.281]  I went through a grocery store late in the evening the other night, and there was a guy loading the shelves with a box cutter.
[00:19:32.301 --> 00:19:35.422]  And I said, I'm surprised Homeland Security hasn't gotten rid of you.
[00:19:36.502 --> 00:19:38.963]  And he laughed, and I ended up placing one with him.
[00:19:39.023 --> 00:19:41.444]  He couldn't believe the airplanes were taken down with box cutters.
[00:19:42.365 --> 00:19:43.105]  Goodbye, old friend.
[00:19:43.485 --> 00:19:45.166]  Keep it up, my good friend.
[00:19:45.286 --> 00:19:49.187]  Excellent job, Patrick, John, Eric, Wilbur, others.
[00:19:49.227 --> 00:19:50.548]  You're up next when we get back.
[00:19:51.187 --> 00:19:54.550]  Infowars.com and PrisonPana.tv are just two of the websites.
[00:19:55.071 --> 00:19:57.553]  There's so much other news coming up, and all your great calls.
[00:19:57.994 --> 00:20:00.556]  Stay with us.
[00:20:01.657 --> 00:20:04.179]  David J. Smith for NewsWatch Magazine.
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:14.009]  Have you ever wondered what former President George Herbert Walker Bush meant in 1990 by saying the Desert Storm War was a good chance to start the New World Order?
[00:20:14.978 --> 00:20:21.783]  The New World Order would cause us to lose our freedoms guaranteed by the Constitution and also our national sovereignty.
[00:20:22.684 --> 00:20:24.125]  Is this what Americans want?
[00:20:24.365 --> 00:20:27.408]  To be merged into a communist-style one world government?
[00:20:28.371 --> 00:20:36.917]  We'd like to help you to understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:21:02.747 --> 00:21:03.288]  Hi, folks.
[00:21:03.328 --> 00:21:05.071]  Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:21:05.391 --> 00:21:06.373]  The real money, folks.
[00:21:09.685 --> 00:21:13.088]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:21:13.168 --> 00:21:15.029]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:21.255]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:21:30.948 --> 00:21:36.573]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:21:37.193 --> 00:21:40.216]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[00:21:40.776 --> 00:21:45.921]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:47.222 --> 00:21:51.145]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[00:21:51.846 --> 00:21:54.768]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[00:21:55.209 --> 00:21:56.510]  That's Midas Resources at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:01.167 --> 00:22:02.728]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:22:03.128 --> 00:22:08.870]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:14.252]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:22:14.592 --> 00:22:23.876]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:22:24.236 --> 00:22:29.178]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:22:29.499 --> 00:22:33.521]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:22:33.721 --> 00:22:38.503]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:22:38.863 --> 00:22:44.766]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:22:45.106 --> 00:22:51.335]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:22:51.375 --> 00:22:52.357]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:22:52.417 --> 00:22:53.318]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:23:03.490 --> 00:23:08.972]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:23:09.392 --> 00:23:13.613]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:23:13.853 --> 00:23:20.895]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:23:21.275 --> 00:23:27.377]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:23:27.517 --> 00:23:28.737]  There are no side effects.
[00:23:28.917 --> 00:23:29.397]  We're good to go.
[00:23:45.863 --> 00:23:48.945]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.

[00:23:49.025 --> 00:23:49.105]  866-885-6625.
[00:23:49.325 --> 00:23:50.285]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:23:50.305 --> 00:23:50.546]  Call today.
[00:23:50.626 --> 00:23:52.066]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:23:52.086 --> 00:23:53.807]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:19.321 --> 00:24:20.541]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:24:20.781 --> 00:24:22.442]  Patrick and Marilyn, you're on the air.
[00:24:22.462 --> 00:24:22.942]  Go ahead.
[00:24:23.442 --> 00:24:23.962]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:24:24.483 --> 00:24:25.143]  Good to talk to you.
[00:24:25.523 --> 00:24:29.164]  I want to thank you for your defense of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and liberty.
[00:24:29.824 --> 00:24:34.346]  Like you, I believe that after the next terrorist attack, the government will likely impose martial law.
[00:24:35.006 --> 00:24:37.066]  Because of this, I would like to ask the following question.
[00:24:37.086 --> 00:24:45.429]  Do you happen to know of any book, magazine, pamphlet, or video which tells the average typical American how to prepare for life under martial law?
[00:24:46.109 --> 00:24:51.552]  Having talked with several acquaintances about this scenario, the best we could come up with is to use some of the old Y2K material.
[00:24:52.012 --> 00:24:54.834]  But none of that information really tells you what to do about martial law.
[00:24:54.854 --> 00:24:56.114]  Do you have any ideas?
[00:24:56.955 --> 00:25:04.179]  Well, there are books written by, there's the Swiss book Total Resistance, or the French book Total Resistance.
[00:25:05.299 --> 00:25:08.401]  There's several books I read many, many years ago about it.
[00:25:09.444 --> 00:25:17.567]  And, again, it'll be kind of a martial law light, where they just, you know, we all have to swipe our ID cards, and it's for our safety.
[00:25:17.947 --> 00:25:20.528]  The whole tracking grid's already being put into place.
[00:25:20.548 --> 00:25:22.088]  I can agree with that.
[00:25:22.108 --> 00:25:36.793]  And the best thing we can do is point out that giving up our liberty doesn't give us security, and getting control of our states at the state level, like many states are now discussing, quote, if martial law is declared, Arizona, New Hampshire, and others...
[00:25:38.115 --> 00:25:41.338]  Have even introduced legislation to pull out of the union.
[00:25:41.358 --> 00:25:44.882]  So the big solution really is political.
[00:25:45.742 --> 00:25:47.945]  And to fight the different tools of control.
[00:25:49.786 --> 00:25:52.769]  Because for martial law to work, they've got to get us to go along with it.
[00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:53.330]  Right.
[00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:57.550]  But Tommy Franks has said another attack.
[00:25:57.570 --> 00:26:01.873]  We're going to set aside the Constitution in favor of a military form of government.
[00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:04.515]  I mean, they're actually discussing it.
[00:26:04.856 --> 00:26:08.918]  They're actually setting up, quote, the shadow government, the doomsday plan.
[00:26:09.679 --> 00:26:11.700]  Congress is signing over all its authority.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:19.206]  But the borders stay wide open, and our government cozies up to communist China and fascistic Russia.
[00:26:20.186 --> 00:26:20.546]  Sure do.
[00:26:21.987 --> 00:26:24.109]  Well, okay, thanks for your tip, Alex.
[00:26:25.017 --> 00:26:34.087]  You know, it just seems to me, I wish the average American citizen would wake up and see the real state of things, but I guess they're being entertained by the TV, sports, and videos, and who knows what else.
[00:26:35.388 --> 00:26:43.797]  Well, you know, for those that are still hooked into the matrix, they're getting even more dumbed down, but there is a growing mass of people that are waking up.
[00:26:44.558 --> 00:26:47.681]  So if you watch television at night, you'll feel hopeless and feel like nobody...
[00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:49.319]  See what's happening.
[00:26:49.719 --> 00:26:54.061]  But if you get out there and really talk to the people in the heartland of this country, they are waking up.
[00:26:54.081 --> 00:26:54.621]  Thanks for the call.
[00:26:54.841 --> 00:26:55.301]  Okay, thank you.
[00:26:55.641 --> 00:26:56.042]  You bet.
[00:26:56.322 --> 00:27:03.924]  But, I mean, don't look for Peter Jennings and the rest of them to Brian Williams to tell you that we're winning this fight.
[00:27:03.944 --> 00:27:04.905]  They're never going to tell you that.
[00:27:05.465 --> 00:27:06.345]  John in Texas.
[00:27:06.365 --> 00:27:07.005]  Go ahead, John.
[00:27:07.025 --> 00:27:07.966]  Hi, Alex.
[00:27:07.986 --> 00:27:08.566]  How are you doing?
[00:27:08.846 --> 00:27:09.066]  Good.
[00:27:10.127 --> 00:27:15.868]  Hey, I heard a guy the other day called in and sort of made the attenuation that you were just in this for the money the other day.
[00:27:16.729 --> 00:27:17.129]  And, uh...
[00:27:17.952 --> 00:27:21.894]  Me, you're just as good a talk show host as any of the neocons out there.
[00:27:21.934 --> 00:27:30.179]  And if you were to throw in a towel and go to the dark side, I'm sure that you could be a millionaire ten times over and probably live up on the Gold Coast of Florida with Rush.
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:36.683]  And it sort of burns me that... Well, I've actually been... I've actually had those offers.
[00:27:36.743 --> 00:27:47.229]  In fact, I had one where it's like the movie in the smoky room with the good-looking women on either side of the executive licking their lips and with the contract on the table for a million bucks first year.
[00:27:48.072 --> 00:27:49.552]  And that was almost six years ago.
[00:27:50.453 --> 00:27:55.194]  And I make a fraction of that each year, and I tell people to make copies of my documentary films.
[00:27:56.054 --> 00:28:01.135]  And, I mean, really, I provide a service, information, alternative news.
[00:28:01.215 --> 00:28:09.037]  I put my life on the line, and I don't do this for the money, but there's nothing wrong with making money, and I hope people will buy my videos.
[00:28:09.097 --> 00:28:13.237]  And your prices for your videos are about the same as what the History Channel charges.
[00:28:13.317 --> 00:28:15.758]  It's not excessive, and you tell people to make copies of them, so...
[00:28:17.124 --> 00:28:19.826]  It's not about Alex Jones regardless.
[00:28:20.126 --> 00:28:25.550]  I could be the most horrible profiteer on the planet and it doesn't matter.
[00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:26.931]  What I'm saying is true.
[00:28:27.712 --> 00:28:30.854]  It's what people psychologically disassociate.
[00:28:32.235 --> 00:28:35.157]  This mass disassociation is they rationalize.
[00:28:35.197 --> 00:28:35.937]  They make excuses.
[00:28:36.278 --> 00:28:38.179]  If they're faced with scary information...
[00:28:39.059 --> 00:28:41.421]  I got one other thing I wanted to say, Alex, before I leave.
[00:28:41.441 --> 00:28:44.223]  I was watching a news program a couple weeks ago, and it was about Vladimir Putin.
[00:29:01.906 --> 00:29:03.547]  Anyway, they showed him standing up there.
[00:29:03.587 --> 00:29:06.649]  He was reviewing the Army, and the Army was marching by him.
[00:29:06.949 --> 00:29:09.911]  And they all had red banners with hammer and sickles on them.
[00:29:09.931 --> 00:29:11.712]  I thought communism was dead in Russia.
[00:29:12.072 --> 00:29:15.414]  Two years ago, they put the hammers and sickles back up everywhere.
[00:29:15.434 --> 00:29:17.695]  They put them back on the tanks and uniforms.
[00:29:17.715 --> 00:29:20.557]  So I guess things didn't change too much over there, then.
[00:29:21.097 --> 00:29:24.639]  Well, the media's told you it has, so just ignore that, okay?
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:24.900]  Yep.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:26.481]  All right, good.
[00:29:26.541 --> 00:29:30.403]  You've got to learn that, you know, they tell you there's no inflation, even though it's at record highs.
[00:29:31.587 --> 00:29:38.470]  They tell you that the economy's better, even though all the indicators show that's not the case.
[00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.331]  Just learn to shut up.
[00:29:40.431 --> 00:29:45.953]  I mean, Bush, the neocons are hailing him as conservative with a record $2.6 trillion budget.
[00:29:46.973 --> 00:29:48.414]  Bill Clinton's was $1.7 trillion.
[00:29:51.635 --> 00:29:52.536]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.016 --> 00:29:54.636]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.557 --> 00:29:58.218]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.411 --> 00:30:05.094]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up Technology.
[00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:09.678]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up Technology?
[00:30:09.919 --> 00:30:16.845]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:30:17.245 --> 00:30:23.893]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:30:24.193 --> 00:30:27.677]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[00:30:27.817 --> 00:30:28.618]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:30:32.782 --> 00:30:39.926]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[00:30:40.006 --> 00:30:46.710]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:30:46.911 --> 00:30:51.593]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:30:51.753 --> 00:30:54.295]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:30:54.455 --> 00:30:59.118]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[00:31:01.334 --> 00:31:01.974]  We're good to go.
[00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:23.288]  We're good to go.
[00:31:23.348 --> 00:31:24.148]  We're good to go.
[00:31:24.189 --> 00:31:24.749]  We're good to go.
[00:31:56.472 --> 00:32:08.676]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:32:09.056 --> 00:32:10.276]  It suppresses your immune system.
[00:32:10.536 --> 00:32:11.217]  Now check this out.
[00:32:11.557 --> 00:32:14.998]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:32:15.298 --> 00:32:17.439]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[00:32:17.959 --> 00:32:20.621]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[00:32:20.901 --> 00:32:21.662]  Your health suffers.
[00:32:21.902 --> 00:32:22.543]  It's that simple.
[00:32:22.883 --> 00:32:26.826]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[00:32:27.286 --> 00:32:35.212]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.
[00:32:35.652 --> 00:32:39.755]  For a limited time only, get a Garricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.

[00:32:41.657 --> 00:32:43.438]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[00:32:43.478 --> 00:32:45.220]  A Garricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.420]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:33:04.004 --> 00:33:10.045]  From his Central Texas Command Center, feet behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.645 --> 00:33:13.586]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.707 --> 00:33:19.367]  All right, more of your calls coming up.
[00:33:19.988 --> 00:33:21.248]  I'm a little bit unorthodox.
[00:33:21.308 --> 00:33:25.989]  I'll just pick a random day out of the week, like this Wednesday, and I'll say no guests!
[00:33:26.624 --> 00:33:28.285]  I'll have to tell my producer, stop it!
[00:33:28.825 --> 00:33:31.386]  Cancel those guests, because she loves to get so many great guests.
[00:33:31.886 --> 00:33:42.631]  So we get a chance to talk to you, the callers, because you take us in so many different, important directions that a limited guest wouldn't, or that I wouldn't think to take us.
[00:33:42.671 --> 00:33:46.853]  So I always enjoy your calls, and more of your calls coming up here in a few minutes at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:46.873 --> 00:33:46.933]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:54.059 --> 00:33:57.526]  There's a bunch of other news I want to cover concerning Iran.
[00:33:57.566 --> 00:34:04.741]  You know Scott Ritter came out two days ago and said, Hey, my inside intel is we're going to war with Iran in June.
[00:34:06.289 --> 00:34:10.412]  And Scott Ritter hasn't been wrong yet, the former U.S.
[00:34:10.452 --> 00:34:11.313]  weapons inspector.
[00:34:11.413 --> 00:34:13.915]  But I hope he's wrong this time.
[00:34:13.955 --> 00:34:20.100]  But now Bush and German leader said they share the same goal in Iran, and things are really heating up.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.723]  So we'll cover some of that and a bunch of other news here in just a moment.
[00:34:24.244 --> 00:34:27.386]  Then we'll go straight back to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:34:27.406 --> 00:34:29.528]  Before I get back to the news and your calls, though...
[00:34:34.756 --> 00:34:49.015]  I really get tired of hyping my videos, getting up here and hyperventilating and talking about how wonderful they are and how they'll wake people up and how they're the best truth-seeking films out there, bar none.
[00:34:50.501 --> 00:34:51.922]  And that's not really my opinion.
[00:34:51.962 --> 00:35:00.047]  I mean, a lot of people, prominent individuals and just common folks like myself, have seen the effects of these documentaries.
[00:35:00.627 --> 00:35:05.010]  They really do wake people up because they cover masses of information.
[00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:05.870]  Each film does.
[00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:10.193]  All the films are the equivalent of multiple documentaries combined.
[00:35:10.573 --> 00:35:11.774]  They're fast-moving.
[00:35:12.274 --> 00:35:16.617]  They always give it to you, the information, in a historical framework.
[00:35:17.595 --> 00:35:24.098]  We show the big picture while focusing in on individual events throughout that mosaic.
[00:35:25.018 --> 00:35:27.319]  And it's very, very effective.
[00:35:28.860 --> 00:35:31.381]  Police state three total enslavement, for instance.
[00:35:31.461 --> 00:35:32.982]  Two hours, 44 minutes.
[00:35:35.443 --> 00:35:41.045]  It describes what the New World Order is, who the globalists are, who the neocons are, what their goals are.
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:49.706]  And then it goes into the latest police state developments, Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, the RFID chips, the foreign troops.
[00:35:50.667 --> 00:35:51.507]  It's all there.
[00:35:51.547 --> 00:35:57.672]  I mean, if somebody watches this video, they're going to really know the globalist master plan.
[00:35:58.973 --> 00:36:00.394]  Or 9-11, the road to tyranny.
[00:36:00.974 --> 00:36:06.719]  It's been so effective at waking people up to government involvement in 9-11 because it doesn't just focus in on 9-11.
[00:36:07.139 --> 00:36:08.560]  It shows admitted U.S.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.561]  government documents
[00:36:10.242 --> 00:36:14.243]  Where the government said it wanted to carry out terror attacks to blame it on foreign enemies.
[00:36:14.683 --> 00:36:19.405]  It shows other terror attacks our government has carried out to blame on foreign enemies.
[00:36:20.225 --> 00:36:27.547]  It goes over Hitler doing it and Nero doing it and what happened in 1898 with the sinking of the Maine.
[00:36:28.568 --> 00:36:30.808]  So it shows you example after example.
[00:36:30.928 --> 00:36:32.949]  Then it gets into the First World Trade Center bombing.
[00:36:33.519 --> 00:36:45.564]  Then it goes into Oklahoma City, and then the second 9-11 attack on September 11th, and then the last 30 minutes is why the globalists want to do this, the motive.
[00:36:46.244 --> 00:36:48.445]  Not just, oh, they did 9-11, here's the evidence.
[00:36:48.765 --> 00:36:50.326]  We also then give people the motive.
[00:36:52.486 --> 00:36:52.847]  I don't know.
[00:36:52.907 --> 00:36:54.487]  You just really need to have Road to Tyranny.
[00:36:54.507 --> 00:36:55.828]  You need to have Masters of Terror.
[00:36:55.848 --> 00:37:01.310]  It was part two of that film that mainly focuses on 9-11 with some historical background.
[00:37:02.068 --> 00:37:05.030]  The videos are all $25.95 a piece.
[00:37:05.050 --> 00:37:05.030]  $20, $19.95.
[00:37:06.551 --> 00:37:07.132]  Be technical.
[00:37:07.632 --> 00:37:11.275]  If you order three or more of any of the 11 titles, that's a huge discount.
[00:37:11.735 --> 00:37:16.398]  I've got other deals where you buy my new video, American Dictators, which is an excellent film.
[00:37:16.418 --> 00:37:21.342]  Each additional copy is $5.95, so you can buy a bunch of copies and give them to people.
[00:37:21.622 --> 00:37:24.164]  Or just buy one copy and make copies.
[00:37:24.244 --> 00:37:24.424]  Just...
[00:37:24.944 --> 00:37:32.290]  Please get them out to talk show hosts and pastors and rabbis or your imams, whoever, opinion makers.
[00:37:33.611 --> 00:37:37.094]  Because by waking them up, they can influence even larger groups of people.
[00:37:37.655 --> 00:37:47.543]  Please go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and order the videos via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Card or call toll-free to get the films at 1-888-253-3139.
[00:37:56.232 --> 00:38:14.041]  888-253-3139, or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704, and you can call the number and get that address if you missed it, or you can go to the website and get it there from the contact page.
[00:38:15.302 --> 00:38:18.023]  But do take action, and don't forget prisonplanet.tv again.
[00:38:18.752 --> 00:38:33.247]  All my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other e-books, dozens of other great documentary films have been authorized to post in high bandwidth, low bandwidth, special text reports, weekly TV shows, 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[00:38:33.968 --> 00:38:34.588]  Why do we do that?
[00:38:35.429 --> 00:38:36.670]  Victims of our own success.
[00:38:36.691 --> 00:38:41.916]  You can't have millions of people coming to your site every month and watching videos for free.
[00:38:42.682 --> 00:38:49.586]  We can have most of them for free, because by people subscribing, then we can have the servers we need to offer a lot of it for free.
[00:38:49.606 --> 00:38:51.888]  But it's kind of a catch-22.
[00:38:51.908 --> 00:38:53.989]  I mean, take American Dictators.
[00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:56.891]  It's right under two hours long.
[00:38:56.931 --> 00:39:03.015]  We've got about 45 minutes of it for free on the website, roughly the first half.
[00:39:04.496 --> 00:39:06.217]  So, you know, that's what we do.
[00:39:07.178 --> 00:39:09.639]  But to do that, we've got to charge for something, folks.
[00:39:09.819 --> 00:39:10.460]  I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:39:11.167 --> 00:39:13.409]  I've had people say, why don't you just give your videos away for free?
[00:39:13.429 --> 00:39:19.573]  Well, I could do that for about a week, and then I'd be wearing a barrel on the side of the street begging for money.
[00:39:20.414 --> 00:39:22.795]  But I've had people call me, can you just give them to me?
[00:39:22.895 --> 00:39:25.217]  And I'm just like, well, I'm sorry, I can't do that.
[00:39:26.698 --> 00:39:28.599]  This is not the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:39:30.521 --> 00:39:32.302]  But again, please take action and get the films.
[00:39:32.362 --> 00:39:39.527]  All right, I want to get to your calls, but let's all just pray for Terry Schindler,
[00:39:40.996 --> 00:39:45.257]  She's known as Terri Schiavo, and most of you know the story.
[00:39:46.297 --> 00:39:48.257]  She's a beautiful young woman, doing great.
[00:39:48.457 --> 00:39:55.038]  It suddenly gets all these bones broken, and a lot of doctors and others have said it looked like foul play.
[00:39:55.699 --> 00:40:09.381]  Her husband, Axel Friendly, the man that discovered her being hurt, he discovers her, and Axel Friendly gets the family to sign over their parental rights to him.
[00:40:10.638 --> 00:40:14.960]  He then gets a multi-million dollar settlement and then suddenly says, unplug her.
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:16.361]  After he said it, he would never unplug her.
[00:40:17.161 --> 00:40:18.642]  And again, she's not in a coma, folks.
[00:40:18.682 --> 00:40:19.942]  She's paralyzed neck down.
[00:40:21.063 --> 00:40:22.783]  And she can mumble, she can smile.
[00:40:23.023 --> 00:40:25.365]  They say blink your eyes twice if you don't want to be killed.
[00:40:25.405 --> 00:40:26.245]  She'll blink her eyes.
[00:40:26.705 --> 00:40:28.426]  There's video of all this on the website.
[00:40:30.027 --> 00:40:35.689]  And the point is that the pro-death crowds all got behind killing her.
[00:40:35.709 --> 00:40:35.769]  And...
[00:40:38.664 --> 00:40:40.605]  She'd gotten to the point where she could eat Jell-O.
[00:40:40.665 --> 00:40:41.486]  She was getting better.
[00:40:42.246 --> 00:40:45.648]  And then he just said no more food fed to her in her mouth.
[00:40:47.149 --> 00:40:48.370]  It's only in a feeding tube.
[00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:49.550]  You can't brush her teeth.
[00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:51.291]  He won't let him brush her teeth for 10 years.
[00:40:52.312 --> 00:40:57.215]  She gets infections, as women do occasionally, especially in this position.
[00:40:57.555 --> 00:40:58.755]  He won't let her have treatment.
[00:40:59.836 --> 00:41:01.157]  He's a punk.
[00:41:01.177 --> 00:41:02.417]  He really makes me mad.
[00:41:03.538 --> 00:41:04.959]  And he spent most of the money...
[00:41:06.361 --> 00:41:08.142]  That he got that was supposed to be for her treatment.
[00:41:08.182 --> 00:41:09.742]  He keeps it all for his greedy self.
[00:41:10.802 --> 00:41:13.263]  And they're scheduled today.
[00:41:13.283 --> 00:41:16.504]  The Supreme Court a few days ago said unplug her.
[00:41:17.004 --> 00:41:18.085]  Take her tube away.
[00:41:18.105 --> 00:41:20.766]  She's not on a respirator, but just take her tube away.
[00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:23.586]  And just God bless her heart.
[00:41:24.587 --> 00:41:26.667]  And they've taken it out before.
[00:41:26.787 --> 00:41:28.708]  And I mean, grueling, what was it, eight, nine days?
[00:41:29.631 --> 00:41:31.714]  And I mean, she's just begging, moaning.
[00:41:32.795 --> 00:41:35.118]  People come in the room, she starts moaning.
[00:41:35.678 --> 00:41:37.200]  I mean, wanting the water.
[00:41:38.021 --> 00:41:40.484]  For those who don't know about this, I've had Wesley Smith on.
[00:41:42.246 --> 00:41:46.651]  And by the way, Wesley Smith isn't some right-winger, as people like to say us evil pro-life people are.
[00:41:46.932 --> 00:41:48.173]  He's what you'd call a liberal.
[00:41:48.213 --> 00:41:49.635]  He's been a Ralph Nader supporter.
[00:41:51.434 --> 00:41:54.876]  But he writes for the Wall Street Journal, and he's written a culture of other publications.
[00:41:55.276 --> 00:42:06.482]  He's written probably 50 articles that I've seen over the last four or five years, where he lists the names of people like Mr. Wendland, who are in wheelchairs, paralyzed shoulders down, talking.
[00:42:07.002 --> 00:42:08.463]  I'd like some food, please!
[00:42:08.823 --> 00:42:09.663]  Please, no!
[00:42:10.063 --> 00:42:10.524]  No!
[00:42:10.904 --> 00:42:20.729]  And they just come in and stop feeding him, because Mr. Wendland put his living will that, oh yeah, I don't want any outside help if...
[00:42:22.323 --> 00:42:23.825]  You know, I'm in a vegetative state.
[00:42:23.865 --> 00:42:29.810]  Well, then the bioethics board at the hospital goes, well, we've decided your life's not worth living.
[00:42:30.571 --> 00:42:47.847]  And then every time we have him on as a guest, nurses and people at hospitals call in, and nurses at these old folks' homes, nursing homes call in, and they talk about people who they get an order, don't give them water, and they actually kill them.
[00:42:48.934 --> 00:42:49.715]  And this is going on.
[00:42:49.735 --> 00:42:52.497]  I mean, the Wall Street Journal has listed literally hundreds of names.
[00:42:53.978 --> 00:43:04.687]  A couple times a year he'll write an article listing 20, 30 names of people, and he'll go visit them, and they're just... In some cases, I mean, I've heard the stories of like an old lady going, Honey, can I please have some water?
[00:43:05.168 --> 00:43:05.828]  Come on.
[00:43:06.329 --> 00:43:07.389]  Come on, please, honey.
[00:43:08.530 --> 00:43:12.434]  And then the person doesn't die in 14 days, and then they fire the nurse.
[00:43:12.654 --> 00:43:13.975]  We know you're giving her water.
[00:43:14.904 --> 00:43:15.784]  You don't believe me?
[00:43:16.344 --> 00:43:19.666]  You see, it's all sold as right to die with dignity.
[00:43:20.906 --> 00:43:22.346]  It's like hate crimes laws are.
[00:43:22.767 --> 00:43:25.747]  Why, you're not for somebody burning a cross in a black person's yard.
[00:43:25.767 --> 00:43:26.588]  Well, of course I'm not.
[00:43:27.268 --> 00:43:28.708]  Well, then pass this law.
[00:43:28.728 --> 00:43:33.830]  And the law is, if you pray on the street corner to defend somebody, you'll get 47 years in prison.
[00:43:34.590 --> 00:43:35.511]  I mean, seriously.
[00:43:36.391 --> 00:43:40.912]  Or, if you've got an anti-Bush sign on a street corner and we don't like it, you get two years in prison.
[00:43:42.313 --> 00:43:43.233]  It's all happening.
[00:43:45.288 --> 00:43:47.770]  So, this is how they do it.
[00:43:48.070 --> 00:43:50.151]  And it is... Folks, I'm not kidding.
[00:43:51.512 --> 00:43:52.213]  Go research it.
[00:43:52.253 --> 00:43:53.994]  Just type Wesley Smith into a search engine.
[00:43:54.014 --> 00:43:55.415]  You can go read his Wall Street Journal articles.
[00:43:55.435 --> 00:43:58.417]  I mean, they're actually murdering people coast to coast.
[00:43:59.098 --> 00:44:06.483]  And Dr. Peter Singer, who was the leader of all these people, and I had one of his minions on a few weeks ago there at Princeton, Peter Singer...
[00:44:08.044 --> 00:44:12.987]  Gave a speech three years ago to the Governor's Conference where he called retarded children subhuman.
[00:44:13.007 --> 00:44:13.928]  The word was subhuman.
[00:44:15.008 --> 00:44:17.010]  Babies until 18 months.
[00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:18.270]  He called them mackerel.
[00:44:18.751 --> 00:44:21.012]  Adults should have the right to kill them up to 18 months.
[00:44:21.853 --> 00:44:22.273]  What was it?
[00:44:22.653 --> 00:44:24.134]  Retarded people subhuman.
[00:44:24.354 --> 00:44:25.435]  Babies mackerel.
[00:44:25.955 --> 00:44:26.636]  What did he call?
[00:44:27.316 --> 00:44:29.017]  Old people he called worthless.
[00:44:30.718 --> 00:44:31.859]  The Governor's Conference.
[00:44:31.919 --> 00:44:35.061]  I mean, this man is speaking to the Governor's.
[00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:39.231]  Well, let me tell you something, you piece of trash.
[00:44:40.812 --> 00:44:42.012]  You're the one that's worthless.
[00:44:44.233 --> 00:44:47.034]  But the point is they're being held up by this sick society.
[00:44:48.715 --> 00:44:50.575]  They're being pushed by this sick society.
[00:44:51.916 --> 00:44:54.137]  And I don't appreciate you calling babies macro.
[00:44:54.157 --> 00:44:57.118]  And I don't appreciate you calling old people worthless.
[00:44:57.658 --> 00:45:00.239]  And I don't appreciate you calling retarded children subhumans.
[00:45:01.713 --> 00:45:03.414]  People go, well, they just don't have a good life.
[00:45:03.434 --> 00:45:04.755]  Well, that's how it started with the Nazis.
[00:45:04.775 --> 00:45:08.276]  They started killing mentally retarded children first in the early 30s.
[00:45:09.717 --> 00:45:12.118]  And it's this attitude of we're the state and we decide.
[00:45:13.999 --> 00:45:15.780]  And believe me, folks, this is the plan.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:19.542]  So, poor Terry Schindler.
[00:45:20.683 --> 00:45:21.363]  Poor thing.
[00:45:22.664 --> 00:45:23.344]  Just amazing.
[00:45:24.985 --> 00:45:27.626]  I've got a bunch of other news here, but let's just go back to your calls.
[00:45:27.706 --> 00:45:30.568]  Before I do that, this really makes me angry.
[00:45:32.148 --> 00:45:33.569]  It makes me happy at one level.
[00:45:34.789 --> 00:45:35.549]  London Guardian.
[00:45:35.870 --> 00:45:38.191]  Edinburgh says no to toll road.
[00:45:39.311 --> 00:45:48.595]  Voters rejected plan for first citywide congestion charge by three to one, running down Whitehall's bid for smog-free, pedestrian-friendly towns.
[00:45:49.935 --> 00:45:52.977]  Plans to introduce congestion charges in cities across the UK.
[00:45:52.997 --> 00:45:54.237]  Transponder tracked.
[00:45:54.617 --> 00:45:56.258]  Put a little matchbox transponder in it.
[00:45:56.658 --> 00:45:58.279]  Read your number as you drive point to point.
[00:45:59.511 --> 00:46:09.616]  Plans to introduce congestion charges in cities across the UK received a serious setback yesterday when voters overwhelmingly rejected the controversial tolls of the first British referendum on the issue.
[00:46:10.357 --> 00:46:15.679]  Residents of Edinburgh voted 3-1 against introducing congestion charges across the Scottish capital.
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:24.824]  Their rejected proposals would have been the most radical ever imposed, the first time an entire city anywhere in the world had been covered by a congestion charge.
[00:46:24.844 --> 00:46:25.525]  That's not true.
[00:46:26.845 --> 00:46:28.046]  Germany's already started it.
[00:46:28.829 --> 00:46:31.350]  And it's part of a global plan, a global treaty with the UN.
[00:46:31.430 --> 00:46:36.531]  We've read the documents on air, had congressmen on, and toll experts on.
[00:46:37.951 --> 00:46:41.552]  Almost every road in Austin by 2010 will be a toll road.
[00:46:42.072 --> 00:46:44.793]  They're going to start out with 14 major roads in Austin.
[00:46:45.493 --> 00:46:47.733]  Every major state road in Texas will have it.
[00:46:49.594 --> 00:46:52.114]  The average Austinite just within Austin will pay $1,855 a year per car.
[00:46:55.533 --> 00:46:58.135]  Statewide, they're talking about another $2,000 on top of that.
[00:46:58.695 --> 00:47:00.536]  If you drive outside the city, so what's $1,802?
[00:47:00.776 --> 00:47:02.357]  We're looking at $3,855.
[00:47:03.117 --> 00:47:07.200]  And man, that's in the newspaper.
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:08.020]  That's the start.
[00:47:09.001 --> 00:47:10.782]  And why is this so important?
[00:47:11.382 --> 00:47:12.863]  This is going in nationwide, by the way.
[00:47:12.903 --> 00:47:13.904]  Swartzy's pushing it.
[00:47:14.244 --> 00:47:16.365]  In California, they just passed the law in Oregon.
[00:47:16.685 --> 00:47:19.127]  California's about to do the same thing.
[00:47:19.167 --> 00:47:23.049]  Same thing's going on in New York, Florida, Wisconsin.
[00:47:23.389 --> 00:47:24.650]  New Mexico's talking about it.
[00:47:26.494 --> 00:47:27.474]  Why is this so important?
[00:47:27.854 --> 00:47:31.955]  Well, in polls in Houston, 98% of Houston Chronicle are against it.
[00:47:31.975 --> 00:47:33.736]  93% in Austin.
[00:47:33.856 --> 00:47:35.476]  We just had a big meeting a few weeks ago.
[00:47:35.496 --> 00:47:36.976]  A thousand people show up.
[00:47:37.356 --> 00:47:39.297]  They say, raise your hands if you're for the tolls.
[00:47:39.437 --> 00:47:40.297]  Two hands went up.
[00:47:41.177 --> 00:47:42.277]  Raise your hand if you're against it.
[00:47:43.057 --> 00:47:43.898]  900 plus went up.
[00:47:45.538 --> 00:47:46.698]  So raise your hand if you're for it.
[00:47:46.758 --> 00:47:47.718]  Raise your hand if you're against it.
[00:47:49.059 --> 00:47:52.599]  Now, they've caught them involved in bribery at the state board level.
[00:47:52.619 --> 00:47:55.360]  Their employees and their families being hired as soon as they passed it.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.862]  And the mayor, and by the way, the recall failed.
[00:47:59.102 --> 00:48:08.329]  They got 40,000-something petitions, but they needed 35,000, but they were told by the city, if you don't have 50,000, we're throwing it out.
[00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:15.115]  And they control the process, but at least they don't have a big voter block and a group to lobby and fight this.
[00:48:15.555 --> 00:48:16.195]  At least they tried.
[00:48:16.215 --> 00:48:17.737]  And next time they'll succeed.
[00:48:18.758 --> 00:48:22.340]  The only way they'll succeed is with a petition recall to put it on a paper ballot.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:25.483]  You see, all across the United States and the world,
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:32.143]  As soon as they put in these electronic voting machines, which are totally fraud-based, we've proven it.
[00:48:33.024 --> 00:48:35.565]  Suddenly, they don't care if 98% are against it.
[00:48:36.266 --> 00:48:38.187]  Suddenly, they just smile at you.
[00:48:38.807 --> 00:48:41.589]  You see about a dozen armored vehicles get ordered by the police.
[00:48:41.949 --> 00:48:43.470]  They start wearing black uniforms.
[00:48:44.111 --> 00:48:45.252]  And stuff gets bad quick.
[00:48:45.632 --> 00:48:46.833]  The voting is disappearing.
[00:48:46.973 --> 00:48:49.934]  And if you don't want to hear this, I'm sorry.
[00:48:50.035 --> 00:48:55.438]  Never before have politicians said, we don't care if 93%, 98%, depending on what poll, are against it.
[00:48:56.428 --> 00:49:02.891]  Never before have they been caught pell-mell trying to bribe people, taking bribes, open bribes, open scams.
[00:49:03.271 --> 00:49:12.434]  You know, the Campo board, half their wives and sons and daughters get $300,000 a year jobs the day after they pass it with the private toll companies.
[00:49:14.295 --> 00:49:16.296]  It's just wild corruption.
[00:49:16.903 --> 00:49:18.384]  I got an article here out of the AP.
[00:49:18.404 --> 00:49:19.384]  We're all over the country.
[00:49:19.664 --> 00:49:25.407]  Cities are now just grabbing whole neighborhoods of beautiful homes and bulldozing them for malls.
[00:49:25.487 --> 00:49:26.667]  No just compensation.
[00:49:26.707 --> 00:49:31.309]  And they admit, just suddenly, cities and states, they're just grabbing everything.
[00:49:31.569 --> 00:49:33.050]  It's going to happen to you too, folks.
[00:49:33.110 --> 00:49:41.013]  I mean, it's just, we got machine guns, we got prisons, we got men in black uniforms, special forces trained, and they'll do whatever they're told.
[00:49:41.653 --> 00:49:43.634]  They'll eat your guts and ass for seconds.
[00:49:44.238 --> 00:49:45.078]  Do you understand?
[00:49:45.138 --> 00:49:46.538]  We are now the authorities.
[00:49:46.939 --> 00:49:48.699]  We are now the officials.
[00:49:49.539 --> 00:49:50.959]  We are now the honorable.
[00:49:51.339 --> 00:49:52.860]  We are now your masters.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:54.840]  Do you understand, slaves?
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.621]  We don't care what you want.
[00:49:58.401 --> 00:50:02.442]  We've got machine guns, and we're not afraid to use them.
[00:50:03.302 --> 00:50:05.022]  You've seen us burn down Waco.
[00:50:05.722 --> 00:50:07.903]  You've seen us blow up World Trade Towers.
[00:50:08.644 --> 00:50:09.784]  You see what we'll do.
[00:50:09.904 --> 00:50:11.885]  We'll lie about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:50:12.145 --> 00:50:13.505]  We'll invade whoever we want.
[00:50:13.925 --> 00:50:16.586]  We'll steal $2.4 trillion from the Pentagon.
[00:50:17.066 --> 00:50:23.567]  We'll give you a $2.6 trillion budget and tell you that it's a record small budget.
[00:50:23.667 --> 00:50:24.847]  It's just insane.
[00:50:26.448 --> 00:50:31.129]  So when you're wondering why, the mayor in Austin will actually laugh at you.
[00:50:31.309 --> 00:50:34.169]  But notice, in England they don't have these electronic machines yet.
[00:50:34.189 --> 00:50:35.470]  The people wouldn't put up with them for a second.
[00:50:36.210 --> 00:50:37.750]  So they're not in the EU yet.
[00:50:38.797 --> 00:50:39.458]  We're good to go.
[00:50:39.478 --> 00:50:40.859]  We're good to go.
[00:51:01.494 --> 00:51:05.837]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.017 --> 00:51:10.439]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.579 --> 00:51:14.982]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.002 --> 00:51:16.343]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.145 --> 00:51:22.369]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.429 --> 00:51:29.377]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.497 --> 00:51:31.500]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:42.306]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.486 --> 00:51:47.849]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:54:06.894 --> 00:54:09.296]  I didn't make myself clear earlier.
[00:54:09.316 --> 00:54:21.865]  The reason I'm upset about this London Guardian article where a lot of the folks in the United Kingdom rejected 3-1 cracker toll roads is because they still got paper ballots.
[00:54:24.111 --> 00:54:32.136]  And just to see now what 40% of the country's got these electronic voting machine systems in, and we've proven the three big companies are openly CIA-run.
[00:54:32.216 --> 00:54:38.620]  I mean, they all have former CIA directors or deputy directors or former... The other two companies are run by former NSA chiefs.
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:46.625]  I mean, it's just... You go to these voting companies, it's literally young men in black suits with short haircuts with bulges under their jackets.
[00:54:46.645 --> 00:54:47.545]  It's just a fraud.
[00:54:47.585 --> 00:54:48.406]  It's like Enron...
[00:54:49.039 --> 00:54:52.321]  Where all the energy trading was fake, and it was really a government front.
[00:54:52.802 --> 00:54:54.743]  Just fake numbers, fake trading boards.
[00:54:55.364 --> 00:54:56.544]  It's just, everything's fake.
[00:54:56.564 --> 00:54:57.925]  They're taking us, folks.
[00:54:57.945 --> 00:54:58.626]  They're taking us.
[00:54:59.707 --> 00:55:02.609]  And so, we don't care if 90 plus percent are against it.
[00:55:03.009 --> 00:55:04.750]  We got the voting machine, so we'll win.
[00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:06.091]  Our mayor just laughs at us.
[00:55:06.932 --> 00:55:09.573]  He'll go in front of a thousand people and just laugh at them.
[00:55:09.734 --> 00:55:11.415]  He'll just go, ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:55:13.136 --> 00:55:13.917]  It's funny to him.
[00:55:14.737 --> 00:55:15.798]  Nobody's going to stop him.
[00:55:16.673 --> 00:55:19.794]  He's got a police department with weapons and armored vehicles.
[00:55:20.854 --> 00:55:24.935]  And they've put in the cameras to control us, and they're building all their little jails and prisons.
[00:55:24.955 --> 00:55:26.035]  Man, we're the slaves.
[00:55:26.735 --> 00:55:29.136]  And until we realize that, we're not going to set about changing it.
[00:55:30.436 --> 00:55:31.256]  Sick of these people.
[00:55:32.256 --> 00:55:34.597]  I'm just sick of them getting away with so much crime.
[00:55:35.217 --> 00:55:40.898]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ken in New York, and Keith, Justin, Phil, Malta in Denmark, and others.
[00:55:41.178 --> 00:55:41.918]  Go ahead, Ken.
[00:55:42.579 --> 00:55:43.039]  Hi, Alex.
[00:55:43.519 --> 00:55:43.839]  Welcome.
[00:55:44.139 --> 00:55:44.399]  Thank you.
[00:55:45.097 --> 00:55:48.839]  The first caller talked about your guest yesterday, the guy from Canada.
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:53.802]  He was talking about the occultic architecture in Washington.
[00:55:54.142 --> 00:55:56.804]  The second hour of the show comes in very badly.
[00:55:56.824 --> 00:55:57.844]  There's interference.
[00:55:59.205 --> 00:56:03.728]  I was intending to listen to the rebroadcast later in the night.
[00:56:04.708 --> 00:56:12.173]  For the first time since I've been listening to the show, I've been listening for about a year and a half almost every day, that show wasn't rebroadcast.
[00:56:12.653 --> 00:56:14.274]  It was another program broadcast.
[00:56:15.226 --> 00:56:19.688]  And you know why that happened, or can you look into that?
[00:56:19.708 --> 00:56:21.208]  Because I'm really... Sir, I don't know.
[00:56:21.228 --> 00:56:23.429]  I mean, are you listening on AM, FM, shortwave internet?
[00:56:23.569 --> 00:56:24.029]  Shortwave.
[00:56:25.170 --> 00:56:26.250]  Have you heard another show?
[00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:31.332]  Yeah, they... Remember that interview you had with James Hughes, the transhumanist?
[00:56:31.932 --> 00:56:33.472]  They rebroadcast that show.
[00:56:34.793 --> 00:56:34.913]  And...
[00:56:35.658 --> 00:56:44.503]  It sounded... What I could get from the second hour with that interview sounded really interesting, and I... Well, that was a mistake then by the network, and we'll get to the bottom of it.
[00:56:44.624 --> 00:56:45.244]  Okay, thanks.
[00:56:47.245 --> 00:56:51.568]  Talking about Bush with Iran, I just heard a radio report a couple hours ago.
[00:56:51.588 --> 00:57:02.214]  He's in Germany now, and when a reporter asked him about Iran, he said that it looked like Mr. Bush could barely suppress his anger at Iran.
[00:57:02.234 --> 00:57:02.294]  And...
[00:57:04.082 --> 00:57:06.424]  I'm looking at this picture of Thomas P.M.
[00:57:06.464 --> 00:57:08.765]  Barnett in a recent issue of the New American.
[00:57:08.805 --> 00:57:10.546]  You see the glaze in this guy's eyes.
[00:57:11.907 --> 00:57:16.290]  You mentioned how Scott Ritter talked about Iran being attacked possibly by June.
[00:57:16.930 --> 00:57:18.451]  I'm wondering if it might be even sooner.
[00:57:18.471 --> 00:57:21.093]  You just look at these guys.
[00:57:21.113 --> 00:57:26.516]  You look at them on TV and you can see their expressions and the eye contact.
[00:57:26.596 --> 00:57:29.718]  It looks like they can't wait to start this confrontation.
[00:57:30.769 --> 00:57:32.731]  Well, I mean, it's like Hitler.
[00:57:32.771 --> 00:57:35.993]  He just had to invade everybody, and he had to have more power and control.
[00:57:36.053 --> 00:57:36.874]  Thanks for the call.
[00:57:37.695 --> 00:57:38.595]  I really appreciate it.
[00:57:38.615 --> 00:57:39.876]  Let's talk to Keith.
[00:57:40.697 --> 00:57:41.518]  Keith, you're on the air.
[00:57:41.538 --> 00:57:42.478]  Where are you calling us from?
[00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:43.479]  From Michigan.
[00:57:43.659 --> 00:57:43.979]  Welcome.
[00:57:43.999 --> 00:57:45.721]  It's a pleasure to be talking to you again.
[00:57:45.741 --> 00:57:48.183]  Another Phantom of Woff's liberty here.
[00:57:50.114 --> 00:57:54.235]  I wanted to ask you, they had an FBI document in Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:54.355 --> 00:57:55.676]  Where can I get a copy of that?
[00:57:55.976 --> 00:57:57.416]  You just said FBI document.
[00:57:57.736 --> 00:57:59.036]  Yeah, it's an FBI document.
[00:57:59.056 --> 00:58:03.658]  It says patriots and homeschoolers, super patriots, they're all terrorists, FEMA's.
[00:58:04.698 --> 00:58:07.879]  Well, that was in the Washington Times about that article.
[00:58:07.899 --> 00:58:10.279]  There's a copy of it on my website.
[00:58:10.299 --> 00:58:10.459]  There is.
[00:58:13.075 --> 00:58:13.295]  Okay.
[00:58:13.555 --> 00:58:14.976]  Well, I've been searching around for it.
[00:58:14.996 --> 00:58:15.496]  I haven't found it.
[00:58:15.916 --> 00:58:19.078]  Also, last night... I mean, do you know how to use a search engine?
[00:58:19.098 --> 00:58:21.139]  You've got to actually enter in what the headline is.
[00:58:21.159 --> 00:58:22.960]  Okay, what is the headline?
[00:58:24.901 --> 00:58:29.904]  Depending on which article you're talking about in the film, it's a Phoenix FBI document.
[00:58:29.924 --> 00:58:31.665]  It calls Christians terrorists.
[00:58:32.125 --> 00:58:32.385]  Okay.
[00:58:32.545 --> 00:58:33.285]  That would probably get it.
[00:58:33.305 --> 00:58:40.789]  Okay, and yesterday on Fox News Channel, they had this little six places where the...
[00:58:43.072 --> 00:58:47.395]  Chemical weapons are being stored, and it's just laid it out for the terrorists to attack them.
[00:58:48.896 --> 00:58:50.257]  We'll be back with the second hour.
[00:58:51.597 --> 00:58:52.178]  Berkey Waters.
[00:58:58.102 --> 00:58:58.702]  Big Brother.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:03.781]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.522 --> 00:59:05.402]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.083 --> 00:59:09.765]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.265 --> 00:59:14.348]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:35.020 --> 00:59:43.527]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now into our number two on this Wednesday, the 23rd day of February 2005 edition.
[00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:45.108]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:45.288 --> 00:59:46.770]  Wide open phones.
[00:59:47.330 --> 00:59:51.754]  Any issue, any news item you'd like to discuss, we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:59:52.543 --> 00:59:58.345]  Well, they rejected electronic tracker toll roads in England, in large sections of the country.
[00:59:58.385 --> 01:00:00.306]  They forced it on them in London.
[01:00:01.347 --> 01:00:04.128]  But here in the United States, they don't care what the people want.
[01:00:04.148 --> 01:00:05.408]  They're just pushing ahead with it.
[01:00:06.369 --> 01:00:09.250]  Meanwhile, I have this article out of the news and record.
[01:00:09.810 --> 01:00:12.171]  Patrol cars to be tracked by satellite.
[01:00:12.211 --> 01:00:16.553]  Big Brother will soon have its eyes on Greensboro and High Point cops.
[01:00:17.193 --> 01:00:22.315]  And every week I see an article where cop cars get GPS put in them.
[01:00:23.570 --> 01:00:33.979]  And because the cops are forced to do it, then as they're going to push it to be the law for the citizens, they'll say, hey, civilians, which they're civilians too, but now they're a military nomenclature.
[01:00:33.999 --> 01:00:35.020]  They call us civilians.
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:36.521]  They're the authorities.
[01:00:36.561 --> 01:00:37.402]  We're the servants.
[01:00:38.022 --> 01:00:39.364]  Hey, you better take it too.
[01:00:39.444 --> 01:00:40.505]  We've had it for years.
[01:00:41.265 --> 01:00:42.887]  This is one more thing the globalists do.
[01:00:43.307 --> 01:00:50.053]  So we should try to stand up for the police and ensure that they're not tracked by these satellite tracker boxes.
[01:00:51.730 --> 01:00:53.351]  And don't think it'll bust bad cops.
[01:00:53.371 --> 01:00:55.712]  Whenever a bad cop's doing something, that'll all be covered up.
[01:00:56.212 --> 01:01:02.756]  And then good cops, if they want to get in trouble, they'll find some small thing they did or five minutes too long at 7-Eleven and fire them.
[01:01:03.036 --> 01:01:03.956]  That's already been happening.
[01:01:04.477 --> 01:01:06.418]  Pakistan may use nukes against India.
[01:01:06.438 --> 01:01:08.599]  That's what one of the big Indian newspapers is saying.
[01:01:08.619 --> 01:01:10.600]  That's what the CIA is supposedly saying.
[01:01:10.620 --> 01:01:11.460]  They're reporting on it.
[01:01:11.981 --> 01:01:14.562]  Cash under threat from RFID payments.
[01:01:15.322 --> 01:01:18.304]  More and more people are paying with RFID tracker chips.
[01:01:19.165 --> 01:01:21.707]  Mars pictures reveal frozen sea.
[01:01:22.147 --> 01:01:23.248]  That's out of the BBC.
[01:01:23.348 --> 01:01:25.809]  A really big development there.
[01:01:26.310 --> 01:01:26.770]  The U.S.
[01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:29.652]  drug czar likens fighting drugs to war on terror.
[01:01:29.732 --> 01:01:32.394]  See, everything is an act of terror now.
[01:01:33.014 --> 01:01:34.935]  But right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:01:35.516 --> 01:01:38.998]  Justin in Ohio, then Phillip, Molta, and others.
[01:01:39.078 --> 01:01:39.898]  Justin, go ahead.
[01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:40.659]  Oh, hi, Al.
[01:01:40.779 --> 01:01:41.700]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:42.160]  Welcome.
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:48.364]  Yeah, I wanted to make a comment about the transhumanists that you had on a couple days ago, maybe a week ago.
[01:01:49.443 --> 01:01:55.405]  I thought his major problem was his die-hard religion of the theory of evolution.
[01:01:56.265 --> 01:02:00.907]  I wanted to bring up the name, kind of like name drop, if you've ever heard of Dr. Kent Hovind.
[01:02:02.908 --> 01:02:04.609]  No, I think I've heard that name.
[01:02:04.649 --> 01:02:06.289]  I can't place it, but I would just say this.
[01:02:06.309 --> 01:02:10.491]  For those that don't know what you're talking about, basically tell them what the transhumanist was saying.
[01:02:10.811 --> 01:02:14.152]  Well, he believes in the further evolution of the human species and kind of
[01:02:14.861 --> 01:02:21.603]  They're saying that there's going to be different species of humans than this... And our life form's going to basically end, we're going to become machines, basically.
[01:02:21.623 --> 01:02:27.065]  Well, yeah, they promoted in the high schools, like, evolution's a fact in the first place, which is not even close to anything.
[01:02:27.245 --> 01:02:31.546]  We're all human, we're all the same species, we're all human beings that have the same rights.
[01:02:32.286 --> 01:02:44.570]  And Dr. Hovind's saying, he's been talking for about the past 15 years and traveling, trying to destroy this religion of evolution and wake people up as to the true truth of the creation stories.
[01:02:45.493 --> 01:02:49.356]  And if anybody's interested out there, his website's drdino.com.
[01:02:49.856 --> 01:02:57.721]  I'm sorry for plugging somebody else on your show, but I think a lot of your listeners might be interested into it and some of the material he puts out.
[01:02:57.962 --> 01:02:59.823]  Yeah, I think he's based in Pensacola.
[01:03:00.103 --> 01:03:01.244]  Yeah.
[01:03:01.784 --> 01:03:03.385]  I'm familiar with who you're talking about now.
[01:03:04.006 --> 01:03:06.647]  Yeah, he does a video on the New World Order.
[01:03:06.688 --> 01:03:10.170]  He's actually the guy that woke me up to what's going on.
[01:03:11.781 --> 01:03:14.744]  Well, the human species is made in the image of God.
[01:03:14.784 --> 01:03:15.625]  It is sacred.
[01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:23.394]  And the open manipulation with the species is just insane.
[01:03:23.874 --> 01:03:25.676]  It's very dangerous, and it's...
[01:03:27.239 --> 01:03:29.922]  We've got to hold the line against this, but the globalists don't want to.
[01:03:29.962 --> 01:03:30.462]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:30.482 --> 01:03:31.083]  Oh, no problem.
[01:03:31.103 --> 01:03:31.443]  Thank you.
[01:03:31.503 --> 01:03:32.364]  Really interesting points.
[01:03:32.484 --> 01:03:36.068]  Phillip, Malta, and others, you're up next.
[01:03:36.088 --> 01:03:36.448]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:36.588 --> 01:03:39.411]  A ton of really important news coming up.
[01:03:39.831 --> 01:03:41.453]  And, of course, more of your phone calls.
[01:03:41.953 --> 01:03:43.335]  We'll take a lot of them in this hour.
[01:03:43.355 --> 01:03:43.415]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:43.935 --> 01:03:44.356]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.562 --> 01:03:55.083]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:55.283 --> 01:03:58.365]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:03:58.505 --> 01:04:02.388]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:04:02.448 --> 01:04:06.691]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:04:07.031 --> 01:04:10.814]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:04:10.894 --> 01:04:12.695]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:04:16.017 --> 01:04:21.000]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:04:21.160 --> 01:04:24.201]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:04:24.382 --> 01:04:27.243]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:04:27.723 --> 01:04:33.847]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:04:34.367 --> 01:04:36.208]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:04:52.996 --> 01:04:53.756]  Terrorism.
[01:04:53.916 --> 01:04:54.656]  Terrorism.
[01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:55.597]  Chemical attacks.
[01:04:55.677 --> 01:04:56.337]  Dirty bombs.
[01:04:56.437 --> 01:04:56.857]  Fallout.
[01:04:56.937 --> 01:04:57.937]  Biological attack.
[01:04:58.117 --> 01:04:58.637]  Anthrax.
[01:04:58.718 --> 01:05:00.838]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:05:01.078 --> 01:05:02.679]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:05:02.919 --> 01:05:05.399]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:05:05.779 --> 01:05:12.161]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by...
[01:05:12.381 --> 01:05:13.522]  We're good to go.
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:40.587]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and call them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:40.647 --> 01:05:43.289]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com
[01:05:52.150 --> 01:05:54.592]  Hey everybody, let me talk to you about your weight for a minute.
[01:05:54.632 --> 01:06:05.019]  How many of you have tried the fad diets, you've tried the pills, you've tried counting calories, you've even tried other nighttime weight loss formulas, and nothing seems to be working?
[01:06:05.299 --> 01:06:06.339]  You know what I suggest to you?
[01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:12.704]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:06:12.864 --> 01:06:21.870]  Call Vim and Vigor today at 1-800-622-THIN and they have people standing by to answer your questions about how to lose weight the safe and healthy way.
[01:06:22.370 --> 01:06:24.051]  No ephedra, no stimulants.
[01:06:24.111 --> 01:06:30.234]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[01:06:30.314 --> 01:06:31.635]  This is the real deal, folks.
[01:06:31.715 --> 01:06:34.457]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[01:06:34.537 --> 01:06:35.657]  And it's healthy for you, too.
[01:06:35.817 --> 01:06:42.781]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair, and nails.
[01:06:42.941 --> 01:06:45.002]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[01:06:45.102 --> 01:06:46.163]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:06:46.183 --> 01:06:46.443]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:06:46.463 --> 01:06:46.683]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[01:06:53.234 --> 01:06:58.255]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.635 --> 01:07:00.956]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:00.976 --> 01:07:21.201]  If you're joining us for the first time...
[01:07:22.530 --> 01:07:23.791]  I love this country.
[01:07:24.491 --> 01:07:25.231]  I love freedom.
[01:07:25.711 --> 01:07:29.333]  I don't look at politics through whether they're a Republican or a Democrat.
[01:07:29.353 --> 01:07:30.313]  I look at what they do.
[01:07:30.813 --> 01:07:31.594]  Their actions.
[01:07:31.794 --> 01:07:33.134]  I read the UN documents.
[01:07:33.254 --> 01:07:38.617]  I read the public publications of the Council on Foreign Relations.
[01:07:38.957 --> 01:07:45.299]  I read the transcripts and the press releases from the Davos World Economic Forum.
[01:07:45.579 --> 01:07:49.541]  I have read the NAFTA and GATT documents for the Pan American Union.
[01:07:51.494 --> 01:07:53.495]  And they say they're getting rid of our sovereignty.
[01:07:54.195 --> 01:07:55.176]  We're going to be taxed at 87%.
[01:07:55.796 --> 01:07:59.058]  We're going to be taxed in our cars.
[01:07:59.138 --> 01:08:01.359]  That's going to be the new big wave of taxation.
[01:08:01.899 --> 01:08:03.640]  Thousands and thousands of dollars a year.
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:05.021]  Everything we do, tracked and traced.
[01:08:05.741 --> 01:08:07.262]  Just like all your cell phones are now.
[01:08:09.003 --> 01:08:18.768]  And they're also going to have a national sales tax with a whole other layer of taxation that will also track and trace what you do and bring federal control into every terminal in the country.
[01:08:21.027 --> 01:08:24.088]  They're going to have a national draft, a national compulsory service.
[01:08:24.128 --> 01:08:25.289]  It's the official documents.
[01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:28.330]  Don't worry, you won't have to serve overseas.
[01:08:28.350 --> 01:08:29.991]  You'll have to serve here domestically, though.
[01:08:31.292 --> 01:08:37.294]  Literally in tattletale squads where you watch your neighbors or say you're in Houston, Texas, you'll watch people in Chicago, Illinois.
[01:08:37.754 --> 01:08:40.536]  For two hours a day, you'll have to, quote, volunteer.
[01:08:40.776 --> 01:08:42.036]  It's compulsory volunteerism.
[01:08:42.376 --> 01:08:43.177]  More doublespeak.
[01:08:44.277 --> 01:08:48.319]  Sitting at your computer screen, watching a split screen of different
[01:08:49.122 --> 01:08:58.289]  Surveillance cameras around the country, and if you don't, they'll even simulate fake terror attacks on the computer screen, and then you'll get in trouble if you don't report it to police immediately.
[01:08:58.529 --> 01:09:01.631]  You'll be hooked into the Chicago Command Center from Houston, Texas.
[01:09:01.931 --> 01:09:05.093]  This is the New York Times Associated Press Reuters CNN.
[01:09:05.454 --> 01:09:09.797]  I heard about this before they started announcing it, but this is how bad it's going to be, folks.
[01:09:12.637 --> 01:09:13.958]  Hell on earth.
[01:09:14.679 --> 01:09:21.604]  All your children, twice a year, you'll get the CPS visit, whether you live in a million dollar house or a one bedroom apartment.
[01:09:22.084 --> 01:09:24.366]  Your children will be forcibly psychologically tested.
[01:09:24.706 --> 01:09:27.508]  The government says they're going to forcibly put half the children on drugs.
[01:09:28.649 --> 01:09:31.131]  Already with foster children, over two thirds are on it.
[01:09:31.391 --> 01:09:33.013]  That shows what they do when they get controlled.
[01:09:34.294 --> 01:09:35.655]  It's just a total nightmare.
[01:09:35.695 --> 01:09:38.517]  You're going to have the Republicans in New York
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.701]  We're good to go.
[01:10:09.745 --> 01:10:21.500]  Into South America, right up, splitting off at Dallas into Oklahoma, and fanning out throughout the country a giant international highway where everyone will legally come and go.
[01:10:22.992 --> 01:10:25.913]  Just total end of our sovereignty, one currency.
[01:10:26.593 --> 01:10:36.817]  Last week, the Globe and Mail, the big official paper to Canada, had the article where they got the documents, which we already had years ago, but here they were going, my gosh, we're going to lose our sovereignty to America and Mexico.
[01:10:36.837 --> 01:10:39.258]  We're going to have one currency, one taxation.
[01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:40.678]  We're going to have foreign police here.
[01:10:40.718 --> 01:10:43.299]  And it went on to mention how the foreign police were already there.
[01:10:44.339 --> 01:10:49.001]  State police from Texas are there teaching their cops how to run checkpoints.
[01:10:50.737 --> 01:10:52.739]  Folks, I mean, I'm upset about this.
[01:10:52.799 --> 01:10:53.899]  I love this country.
[01:10:55.641 --> 01:10:56.682]  And it's so bad.
[01:10:57.082 --> 01:11:05.288]  And they're setting up all these new administrative law courts that have no authority, where there's no due process, where there's no judge, jury, or anything.
[01:11:05.748 --> 01:11:08.651]  It's just an administrative lawyer ruling on you.
[01:11:09.151 --> 01:11:15.175]  I've got stacks of articles where they're just grabbing people's property, pell-mell, no just compensation.
[01:11:15.195 --> 01:11:17.357]  I mean, it's getting bad.
[01:11:17.397 --> 01:11:18.258]  We're being looted.
[01:11:18.278 --> 01:11:18.398]  Looted.
[01:11:20.211 --> 01:11:21.692]  Looted is the word.
[01:11:22.092 --> 01:11:23.272]  We're being ravaged.
[01:11:24.393 --> 01:11:28.114]  Classical, wild, out-of-control tyranny.
[01:11:28.974 --> 01:11:43.860]  But because people are so mesmerized by television, and so mesmerized by Desperate Housewives, and Paris Hilton, and the porno, and the rest of it, that they're totally disconnected from reality.
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:48.162]  They're just drinking their beer, watching their football game, smoking their dope,
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:49.240]  I think?
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.341]  I mean, he's just Twilight Zone.
[01:12:16.521 --> 01:12:17.502]  I'm living in the Twilight Zone.
[01:12:17.702 --> 01:12:25.989]  We've got Arnold Schwarzenegger, who openly says he wants to be a dictator, and that he admires Nazis like Adolf Hitler and Kurt Waldheim, and he campaigns for Kurt Waldheim.
[01:12:26.870 --> 01:12:34.916]  According to Unchallenged Magazine reports, he loves to dominate people and makes employees who aren't attractive get on their knees and call themselves ugly dogs until they cry.
[01:12:34.936 --> 01:12:39.740]  He's for gun control, open borders, abortion on demand.
[01:12:41.152 --> 01:12:42.713]  And he's hailed by Republicans.
[01:12:42.853 --> 01:12:46.054]  I watched them cry as he gave a speech at the RNC.
[01:12:46.114 --> 01:12:46.854]  It's in my new film.
[01:12:47.335 --> 01:12:48.615]  Chanting his name and crying.
[01:12:49.455 --> 01:12:50.776]  Oh, Fuhrer, oh, Fuhrer.
[01:12:51.556 --> 01:12:52.337]  Oh, our leader.
[01:12:52.817 --> 01:12:54.037]  It's just his twilight zone.
[01:12:54.077 --> 01:13:02.241]  If you would have told me ten years ago Arnold Schwarzenegger would be governor and they'd ignore all his dirt and they'd be forced psychologically testing and talking about doing it to adults now.
[01:13:02.321 --> 01:13:05.702]  And my dad came over Sunday.
[01:13:07.873 --> 01:13:08.694]  Or was it Saturday?
[01:13:08.734 --> 01:13:09.334]  It was Sunday.
[01:13:09.554 --> 01:13:13.537]  And after they'd gone to church and we were going to go eat lunch.
[01:13:14.658 --> 01:13:19.822]  And I'm driving with him and my wife and my mother and the kids are driving in the car in front of us.
[01:13:20.962 --> 01:13:24.485]  And my dad goes, look at my new cell phone.
[01:13:24.505 --> 01:13:26.446]  My dad's the type that uses something until it breaks.
[01:13:26.967 --> 01:13:29.889]  He had like some five, six year old cell phone.
[01:13:30.532 --> 01:13:31.953]  He was very proud of his new cell phone.
[01:13:32.413 --> 01:13:34.014]  He goes, look, it's true what you said.
[01:13:34.394 --> 01:13:38.415]  And he holds it up to me as he's driving, and he goes, see that crosshair on there?
[01:13:38.515 --> 01:13:40.076]  He goes, that means I'm being tracked.
[01:13:41.157 --> 01:13:42.957]  And he goes, here's the new owner's manual.
[01:13:42.997 --> 01:13:43.778]  And I said, I know.
[01:13:43.798 --> 01:13:44.518]  And he goes, yeah, I know.
[01:13:44.578 --> 01:13:53.062]  I heard you talk about October 1st, 2000, how all phones by law are tracked, satellite tracked, triangulated by the cell towers, and this tells me if I'm being tracked.
[01:13:53.082 --> 01:13:55.203]  And he goes, yeah, it's just incredible.
[01:13:55.803 --> 01:13:57.504]  It's just everywhere, people.
[01:13:57.584 --> 01:13:58.224]  I mean, it just...
[01:13:59.207 --> 01:14:00.367]  I'm not playing.
[01:14:00.407 --> 01:14:02.288]  This is not a radical broadcast.
[01:14:04.628 --> 01:14:06.808]  It is not radical what we're talking about here.
[01:14:08.089 --> 01:14:09.329]  It's not radical at all.
[01:14:12.829 --> 01:14:14.970]  We'd be weirdos if we weren't upset.
[01:14:15.010 --> 01:14:23.671]  I mean, 90 plus percent of us are against the toll roads and we catch them involved in bribery and fraud and scams and trying to intimidate people.
[01:14:24.871 --> 01:14:26.892]  Frankly, I've been threatened over this toll road thing.
[01:14:26.912 --> 01:14:27.852]  I didn't want to talk about it.
[01:14:28.826 --> 01:14:34.968]  It's just so evil, so corrupt, and it's going in all over the country, and they don't care.
[01:14:35.048 --> 01:14:41.870]  That tells you it's tyranny when you're all against it, when it's a huge fraud, when the documents show they've got plenty of money, and they don't care.
[01:14:41.890 --> 01:14:42.970]  They just don't care.
[01:14:42.990 --> 01:14:44.391]  They're going to do it all to us.
[01:14:46.852 --> 01:14:49.492]  The elite we've got are so criminal.
[01:14:49.712 --> 01:14:51.333]  They are so evil.
[01:14:52.293 --> 01:14:57.855]  There's no way for me to even chronicle all their evil, to even try to give any of it ample attention.
[01:14:59.542 --> 01:15:00.243]  God help us.
[01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:01.484]  Just God help us.
[01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:03.965]  I mean, we've killed 55 million children in this country.
[01:15:04.046 --> 01:15:04.806]  What do you expect?
[01:15:06.307 --> 01:15:15.674]  And you made excuses and rationalized it, so now it's the old people, and it's the retarded, and it's the people who don't, quote, aren't worth living, who are begging for their lives and begging for water and food.
[01:15:17.456 --> 01:15:25.122]  You know, now it's, and the troops are breathing depleted uranium and coming back and dying in mass, and their children three times more likely to be deformed.
[01:15:25.622 --> 01:15:26.122]  It's just evil.
[01:15:28.024 --> 01:15:33.608]  And they steal trillions from the Pentagon, and nobody gets in trouble, and just wall-to-wall corruption.
[01:15:34.608 --> 01:15:37.050]  Wall, the criminals took over!
[01:15:38.031 --> 01:15:44.735]  And they've got slick advertising experts, propagandists working for them that know how to package it real nice.
[01:15:46.496 --> 01:15:48.698]  I pray your eyes will be opened out there listening.
[01:15:48.838 --> 01:15:54.041]  The people that feel like you're part of the system, feel like you're part of the establishment, whether you're an executive at Dell Computer or a cop...
[01:15:56.288 --> 01:16:02.871]  Or some bureaucrat, and you feel like you've done good in the system, and you feel like you're part of it, and you're doing okay.
[01:16:04.571 --> 01:16:05.292]  Listen to me.
[01:16:05.332 --> 01:16:06.872]  You better check out what I'm saying.
[01:16:06.932 --> 01:16:07.953]  Let's take a call.
[01:16:09.734 --> 01:16:15.136]  I guess Phillip in Virginia, and then Malta, Wayne, Eric, and others.
[01:16:15.156 --> 01:16:15.656]  Go ahead, Phil.
[01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:17.370]  Yeah, Alex.
[01:16:17.530 --> 01:16:19.911]  Absolutely astonishing information.
[01:16:21.212 --> 01:16:25.473]  And it reminds me of a bumper sticker I saw a while back.
[01:16:25.813 --> 01:16:28.234]  If you're not outraged, then you're not paying attention.
[01:16:28.794 --> 01:16:30.615]  You know, I think I'm going to copy that bumper sticker.
[01:16:30.655 --> 01:16:33.716]  I've even said I want to have that bumper sticker available.
[01:16:34.384 --> 01:16:34.865]  Exactly.
[01:16:35.185 --> 01:16:35.485]  Yes.
[01:16:35.945 --> 01:16:42.711]  But anyways, we are making some progress, you know, one step forward, two steps back.
[01:16:43.171 --> 01:16:49.737]  But, you know, like the people who voted down the toll road, it does good of them to do that.
[01:16:50.317 --> 01:16:51.198]  We're good to go.
[01:16:51.258 --> 01:16:51.498]  I think?
[01:17:07.749 --> 01:17:10.710]  Well, they're in Virginia Beach after Tampa dropped.
[01:17:10.770 --> 01:17:12.712]  It is the only place that publicly admits it.
[01:17:13.072 --> 01:17:19.476]  But if you read internal documents, almost all the cameras in the country, the big high-quality digitals, are hooked in.
[01:17:19.516 --> 01:17:21.478]  I mean, anything can be face-canned.
[01:17:21.498 --> 01:17:22.518]  They just feed it to the software.
[01:17:22.919 --> 01:17:26.341]  Yeah, I figured that was just a smoke screen, you know, to make everybody feel good.
[01:17:26.901 --> 01:17:28.743]  We're only in one place, you know.
[01:17:29.003 --> 01:17:29.344]  Yes, sir.
[01:17:29.924 --> 01:17:34.469]  But anyway, so much stuff that you were discussing.
[01:17:34.489 --> 01:17:35.129]  Well, take your time.
[01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:36.010]  Talk about whatever you want.
[01:17:36.130 --> 01:17:45.360]  You were talking about, I was listening to you about all the research that you had done, and that was reminding me of a scripture, folks, you need to understand.
[01:17:46.975 --> 01:17:51.216]  Yahweh's people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
[01:17:51.717 --> 01:17:53.897]  That is why we are being destroyed.
[01:17:53.957 --> 01:17:57.798]  If you have that knowledge, then you are not going to be destroyed.
[01:17:58.258 --> 01:18:04.040]  That is to encourage everybody out there that you have to put your trust in Him.
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:06.661]  He is going to protect you in all of this.
[01:18:07.321 --> 01:18:14.043]  Do you know if it is against the law to police the police?
[01:18:15.504 --> 01:18:24.549]  Well, you can't interfere with them, and now that means being, you know, a thousand miles away from them and covering what they're doing, but no, it's not against the law to police the police.
[01:18:24.589 --> 01:18:25.469]  In fact, it's our duty.
[01:18:26.870 --> 01:18:32.913]  Okay, well, I just wanted to know if you wanted to call this guy and ask him why they arrested this fella yesterday.
[01:18:33.113 --> 01:18:33.693]  Well, stay there.
[01:18:33.733 --> 01:18:35.074]  Tell me about what happened when we get back.
[01:18:35.134 --> 01:18:35.754]  I have no idea.
[01:18:35.774 --> 01:18:38.536]  I'm sure it'll be interesting and probably scary.
[01:18:38.576 --> 01:18:39.236]  Stay there, Phil.
[01:18:39.616 --> 01:18:43.618]  Then we'll go to Malta, Wayne, Eric, and everybody else.
[01:18:43.738 --> 01:18:45.059]  Wide open phones today.
[01:18:46.164 --> 01:18:49.126]  presentplanet.tv and infowars.com are the websites.
[01:18:52.528 --> 01:18:57.651]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[01:18:57.911 --> 01:18:58.992]  The real money, folks.
[01:19:02.299 --> 01:19:05.701]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[01:19:05.761 --> 01:19:07.622]  The Dow has ranged from 9,800 to 10,300, a 5% increase.
[01:19:08.223 --> 01:19:13.846]  The dollar's value has dropped from 96 cents to 70 cents against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[01:19:23.539 --> 01:19:29.160]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[01:19:29.781 --> 01:19:32.821]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.
[01:19:33.381 --> 01:19:38.523]  To learn how to protect your shrinking dollar, call Midas Resources today at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:43.744]  Remember, gold is liquid, private, and portable.
[01:19:44.424 --> 01:19:47.365]  Call now before your buying power shrinks even more dramatically.
[01:19:47.805 --> 01:19:49.225]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[01:19:54.319 --> 01:19:56.800]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:19:57.480 --> 01:20:04.143]  Did you know there's an assault upon America's freedom of religion by the United Nations Genocide Convention Treaty?
[01:20:05.303 --> 01:20:07.604]  The laws are called hate crime laws.
[01:20:08.405 --> 01:20:14.507]  These laws will eventually shut down Christianity in America by accusing Christians of hate crimes.
[01:20:15.550 --> 01:20:16.130]  We're good to go.
[01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:16.290]  I think?
[01:20:42.995 --> 01:20:43.035]  516-8736.
[01:20:43.155 --> 01:20:43.816]  Call now.
[01:20:43.876 --> 01:20:47.863]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:20:54.904 --> 01:20:59.405]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:20:59.745 --> 01:21:03.827]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:21:04.147 --> 01:21:04.687]  We listened.
[01:21:04.987 --> 01:21:09.968]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:21:10.249 --> 01:21:10.729]  We listened.
[01:21:11.109 --> 01:21:14.150]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:15.090]  We listened.
[01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:16.250]  We're good to go.
[01:21:44.855 --> 01:21:45.457]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:21:45.477 --> 01:21:46.340]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:21:54.082 --> 01:22:00.547]  Hi, this is Pasha Sharp with the Genesis Radio Network, and I'm here to introduce to you a product that will put the pet back in your step.
[01:22:00.747 --> 01:22:05.390]  If you're like me, a working mom and even working dad, then these issues will sound familiar to you all.
[01:22:05.590 --> 01:22:17.719]  Lack of energy, lack of strength, lack of stamina, lack of sleep, making time for housework, cooking, homework, shopping and chauffeuring, making time with the kids, making time with the husband, making time for intimacy, most importantly, making time for yourself.
[01:22:17.979 --> 01:22:21.842]  I'm here to tell you that there is a way that you can make time for all of these things and more.
[01:22:22.102 --> 01:22:24.364]  Introducing the incredible LifeWave patch.

[01:22:35.151 --> 01:22:37.592]  Anyone looking for that extra edge over their competition?
[01:22:37.872 --> 01:22:39.073]  Or just trying to beat the clock?
[01:22:39.333 --> 01:22:41.375]  This is truly the answer you've been looking for.

[01:22:59.528 --> 01:23:00.428]  Phillip in Virginia.
[01:23:01.869 --> 01:23:07.972]  Of course, for those who don't know who Phillip is, he's a talk show host there in Virginia doing a great job on the station that I'm on, thanks to his great work.
[01:23:08.512 --> 01:23:10.513]  Phillip, tell us what happened to somebody you know?
[01:23:10.533 --> 01:23:12.594]  No, I don't know this fellow.
[01:23:12.614 --> 01:23:13.535]  Oh, it's a news article.
[01:23:14.175 --> 01:23:16.396]  No, I didn't even make the news that I know of.
[01:23:16.816 --> 01:23:26.861]  But what happened was I noticed a couple of police officers arresting this fellow a couple of houses down, so I just walked down there to find out what was going on.
[01:23:27.521 --> 01:23:27.941]  We're good to go.
[01:23:50.626 --> 01:23:52.366]  They just didn't want to answer any of my questions.
[01:23:52.566 --> 01:23:57.469]  I did find out that he was under arrest, and they wouldn't answer for what for, but the older officer did.
[01:23:57.489 --> 01:24:03.951]  Well, the founding fathers said that we were to be real nosy in the government's business and that they were not to be in our business.
[01:24:04.012 --> 01:24:06.533]  So we're not supposed to be in our neighbor's business.
[01:24:06.613 --> 01:24:08.213]  We're supposed to be in their business.
[01:24:08.273 --> 01:24:12.875]  That's the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, and I do that a lot.
[01:24:12.956 --> 01:24:13.496]  If I see...
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:15.901]  I think that's right.
[01:24:42.839 --> 01:24:44.360]  And I've got that on video.
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.060]  I ought to put that in a film.
[01:24:47.961 --> 01:24:58.445]  We had the police working with the military a few years ago out at the old airport, and we were probably 200 yards away in a whole other parking lot of a business across the street.
[01:24:58.485 --> 01:25:00.345]  Man, the cops pull over, start yelling at us.
[01:25:00.886 --> 01:25:03.907]  Fellas turn the cameras off, and we just say, Hey, First Amendment!
[01:25:03.927 --> 01:25:05.087]  And then they back off.
[01:25:05.127 --> 01:25:07.808]  See, it's all about... I'm not against the police per se.
[01:25:07.848 --> 01:25:09.829]  I'm against this mentality.
[01:25:10.815 --> 01:25:11.496]  Any other comments?
[01:25:11.516 --> 01:25:12.736]  Exactly, yeah.
[01:25:13.097 --> 01:25:14.878]  But I do have to give him credit.
[01:25:14.938 --> 01:25:15.858]  He did call me back.
[01:25:15.878 --> 01:25:19.820]  I haven't spoken to him, but I'm going to follow up with it and find out what happened.
[01:25:20.141 --> 01:25:24.683]  But anyway, did you cover former Bush interpreter draws, U.S.
[01:25:24.823 --> 01:25:25.023]  Ivor?
[01:25:26.284 --> 01:25:32.948]  Frederick Burks once had the ear of the president as an interpreter, and now he's a star witness in the Valley Bombing.
[01:25:34.791 --> 01:25:35.832]  No, I'm not aware of that.
[01:25:36.472 --> 01:25:37.773]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:25:37.873 --> 01:25:47.879]  He was a former interpreter for Bush, and he revealed that they tried to U.S.-urged secret Bashir move before the Bali bombing, and they wouldn't cooperate.
[01:25:48.339 --> 01:25:51.341]  So they get something blown up because they don't go along with it.
[01:25:52.682 --> 01:25:54.123]  What publication was that in?
[01:25:54.183 --> 01:25:56.884]  This was in Wall Street Journal, front page of yesterday's paper.
[01:25:57.385 --> 01:26:01.947]  Can you find me an online version of that or mail me a clipping?
[01:26:02.368 --> 01:26:02.968]  I sure will.
[01:26:03.706 --> 01:26:04.206]  Yeah, it was terrible.
[01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:04.406]  Oh yeah.
[01:26:30.774 --> 01:26:35.335]  Well, he's saying that they tried to... Because they wouldn't play hardball with the U.S.
[01:26:35.375 --> 01:26:50.240]  government by handing this guy over, the supposed al-Qaeda imam or something like that, that they wouldn't hand this guy over, so it wasn't long after that that they had a mysterious bombing in Bali.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.521]  The article actually... Wow!
[01:26:53.001 --> 01:26:53.221]  Yeah.
[01:26:53.501 --> 01:26:54.401]  Wall Street Journal.
[01:26:54.421 --> 01:26:56.082]  Well, thanks for the call, and keep up the good work.
[01:26:56.102 --> 01:26:56.182]  Okay.
[01:26:57.042 --> 01:26:57.702]  God bless you.
[01:26:58.082 --> 01:26:59.783]  Malta and Denmark, thanks for holding.
[01:26:59.803 --> 01:27:00.443]  Go ahead, Malta.
[01:27:02.265 --> 01:27:02.606]  Hello.
[01:27:02.626 --> 01:27:03.707]  Hello, sir.
[01:27:03.907 --> 01:27:10.515]  There's RFID shipping and products.
[01:27:11.176 --> 01:27:12.998]  Yes, RFID and products, yes.
[01:27:13.078 --> 01:27:17.744]  I talked to my father about that, and he asked for some evidence.
[01:27:18.525 --> 01:27:20.087]  What's the evidence you have on that?
[01:27:21.849 --> 01:27:24.370]  There's probably been 5,000 articles.
[01:27:24.390 --> 01:27:26.030]  I mean, literally, there's like 50 a day.
[01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.870]  I mean, it's insane.
[01:27:28.151 --> 01:27:34.472]  USA Today, Associated Press, Gillette Razors, Michelin Tires.
[01:27:35.192 --> 01:27:37.073]  They say all products are going to have it.
[01:27:37.133 --> 01:27:40.474]  Walmart's ordered all their suppliers to have it in.
[01:27:40.514 --> 01:27:42.974]  By the end of the year, they won't carry their products.
[01:27:43.835 --> 01:27:46.295]  I mean, it's just... Here's an article.
[01:27:46.395 --> 01:27:48.276]  I've got like three, four articles today.
[01:27:48.316 --> 01:27:48.836]  I mean, literally...
[01:27:49.937 --> 01:27:54.200]  Cash under threat from RFID payments, VNU Net News.
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:28:06.647]  Cash is increasingly coming under threat from radio frequency ID, contactless payment systems that require a user-only way of a small object such as a credit card, key ring, or mobile phone near a reader terminal.
[01:28:06.667 --> 01:28:13.171]  According to ABI research, the coming year we'll see a sharp increase in the number of contactless payment opportunities for consumers.
[01:28:13.891 --> 01:28:15.492]  And it goes, I mean, there it is right there.
[01:28:15.892 --> 01:28:18.594]  What about confirming, but for the authorities...
[01:28:19.138 --> 01:28:26.265]  I mean, I don't know, maybe the Department of Commerce or something like that.
[01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:28.888]  Are they making confirming in the media about that?
[01:28:29.429 --> 01:28:33.613]  Well, the Department of Commerce and the Defense Department have ordered all their suppliers to have it.
[01:28:34.414 --> 01:28:35.174]  Okay.
[01:28:35.194 --> 01:28:36.356]  So that's the tie-in there.
[01:28:37.537 --> 01:28:40.180]  And probably their own... Stay there.
[01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:40.860]  Stay there.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:41.421]  We'll be right back.

[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.742]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:02.902 --> 01:32:13.651]  My friends, I wouldn't be doing my job if I wasn't telling you just how bad things really are.
[01:32:14.371 --> 01:32:22.278]  A lot of people have this idiosyncratic or self-centered worldview that
[01:32:22.987 --> 01:32:24.788]  Well, if it doesn't affect me, it doesn't matter.
[01:32:25.048 --> 01:32:28.910]  Or, well, if I just have a good attitude about it, that'll make it okay and make it go away.
[01:32:28.930 --> 01:32:30.631]  Or, look on the bright side of it.
[01:32:31.291 --> 01:32:37.113]  Well, the bright side is, we're not your slaves in the New World Order, and we've only begun to fight, and you will be defeated.
[01:32:38.914 --> 01:32:45.437]  And you're involved in every form of evil imaginable, including government-run white slavery rings, and we're going to expose you.
[01:32:45.457 --> 01:32:46.558]  We have a responsibility.
[01:32:47.238 --> 01:32:51.060]  But Malta in Denmark was asking me some questions about RFID chips.
[01:32:51.781 --> 01:32:51.961]  Yeah.
[01:32:52.281 --> 01:32:55.563]  Which are going in, I mean, into all the products now.
[01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:58.565]  They're constantly pushing it and promoting it.
[01:32:59.105 --> 01:33:01.507]  And I didn't quite understand your last question.
[01:33:01.607 --> 01:33:03.068]  No, it was not my question.
[01:33:03.088 --> 01:33:04.449]  It was my father's question.
[01:33:04.469 --> 01:33:06.450]  I mean, I don't know.
[01:33:06.610 --> 01:33:10.432]  I understand he probably doesn't trust newspapers.
[01:33:10.932 --> 01:33:14.495]  Maybe just because there's a newspaper article.
[01:33:14.535 --> 01:33:15.815]  Well, look, look, look.
[01:33:15.895 --> 01:33:18.437]  I mean, newspapers lie, they spin, they twist.
[01:33:19.282 --> 01:33:27.425]  But most news is just this plane crashed, this person got elected, this person died, we're putting these up, you know, this new video game came out.
[01:33:27.865 --> 01:33:30.326]  I mean, the industry publications aren't lying.
[01:33:30.606 --> 01:33:32.667]  They're just telling you about what they're doing.
[01:33:32.727 --> 01:33:34.667]  What they're doing is spinning it.
[01:33:34.987 --> 01:33:39.149]  How wonderful RFID, radio frequency identification devices are.
[01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:41.009]  That's not the way in Europe.
[01:33:41.049 --> 01:33:45.211]  They censor things they don't like and don't read about it.
[01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:52.575]  All these big newspapers you have here about the European Union, that's a newspaper never going out to print.
[01:33:52.595 --> 01:33:53.416]  I don't know.
[01:33:53.816 --> 01:33:54.777]  Just don't print it.
[01:33:54.797 --> 01:33:57.520]  Thanks for your call.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:33:59.842]  I really do appreciate the call from Denmark.
[01:34:01.984 --> 01:34:06.148]  Frankly, I have found that European papers will report on our corruption...
[01:34:06.903 --> 01:34:12.625]  And our papers will report on their corruption because the other side never reads it, basically.
[01:34:13.025 --> 01:34:16.987]  But if you look at who owns the newspapers overseas, it's the same people that own our newspapers.
[01:34:17.887 --> 01:34:24.030]  So they'll report on the other group's dirt to make it look like they're giving you some inside information.
[01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:30.192]  But what we can do is go get the foreign news, bring it here, and break that media monopoly.
[01:34:31.633 --> 01:34:32.673]  That media blackout.
[01:34:33.648 --> 01:34:36.069]  Let's just go a little bit faster now through your calls.
[01:34:36.109 --> 01:34:36.950]  I want to get to everybody.
[01:34:37.450 --> 01:34:39.291]  Wayne in Nebraska.
[01:34:39.351 --> 01:34:40.131]  Wayne, go ahead.
[01:34:40.151 --> 01:34:41.391]  Hi, Alex.
[01:34:42.052 --> 01:34:54.657]  I was going to say that our former governor, Mike Johans, is now the Secretary of Agriculture, and now they're cutting the farm subsidies, so this Republican state, these farmers are going to find out just what Bush really is like.
[01:34:56.698 --> 01:34:58.759]  So are you a fan of the subsidies?
[01:35:00.064 --> 01:35:10.346]  Oh, not really, but you know, some of these, I think it should be a free market, but of course we're prohibited from it because we're controlled by the corporations.
[01:35:10.966 --> 01:35:26.449]  It's just like the diesel fuel, you know, we could make soy diesel and it's a better diesel, and there's other stuff that we could do with our subsidies, but being that the government has control over everything, they don't give the
[01:35:28.577 --> 01:35:30.198]  The small guy, any chance?
[01:35:31.299 --> 01:35:32.560]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[01:35:32.580 --> 01:35:45.768]  And the way these subsidies are written up, the big agribusiness is going to still get their money, and then the small farm or rancher had to have the subsidies to compete against the system that was set up to not be fair.
[01:35:46.509 --> 01:35:49.390]  So what they do is they have a system that isn't free market.
[01:35:49.431 --> 01:35:53.153]  They get people addicted to the subsidies, then they start taking them away.
[01:35:53.991 --> 01:35:59.833]  And you're right, but notice he's cutting the subsidies for farmers, but then increasing all the big corporate welfare.
[01:36:01.114 --> 01:36:08.657]  Right, and I also wanted to say that, you know, right now, too, they're starting to cry, peace, peace, you know.
[01:36:09.077 --> 01:36:17.200]  I think this is a time that I want to hinge on what one of your former callers had said about people who don't know the Bible or are biblically illiterate, I'd like to say.
[01:36:17.780 --> 01:36:20.321]  But, you know, basically, we're going to go into Iran.
[01:36:20.401 --> 01:36:21.782]  That's where Peter...
[01:36:22.797 --> 01:36:25.119]  Daniel was standing on the Tigris when he saw what he saw.
[01:36:25.739 --> 01:36:29.441]  And I believe that we're here, as Paul said, to be witnesses.
[01:36:29.501 --> 01:36:30.742]  And I think you do a great witness.
[01:36:30.822 --> 01:36:32.503]  I want to give you a great deal of credit.
[01:36:33.063 --> 01:36:39.407]  But I think that a lot of people don't know what the unforgivable sin is, and that's when we're delivered up.
[01:36:39.427 --> 01:36:46.411]  And I think that's what all these troops and all this stuff is here for, is to deliver us up so that we can let the Holy Spirit speak through us.
[01:36:46.451 --> 01:36:47.892]  That's the unforgivable sin.
[01:36:50.293 --> 01:36:53.096]  To not accept the Holy Spirit.
[01:36:53.756 --> 01:36:53.936]  Right.
[01:36:54.116 --> 01:36:55.097]  That's exactly right.
[01:36:55.217 --> 01:36:56.819]  We're here to be delivered up.
[01:36:57.680 --> 01:37:00.282]  And I believe that's in the book of Luke.
[01:37:02.544 --> 01:37:08.709]  Anyway, we're here to swing the sword of the Lord.
[01:37:08.770 --> 01:37:11.992]  And a lot of people don't know what that sword is, but it's truth.
[01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.193]  It comes out of God.
[01:37:14.392 --> 01:37:16.313]  The mouth of God, his word, his tongue.
[01:37:16.333 --> 01:37:19.894]  Well, unfortunately, they've bought off most of the Christian leaders.
[01:37:20.594 --> 01:37:28.637]  Oh, you know, and really, they're the ones who's going to be crying for the rocks to fall upon them when they follow the wrong Jesus, like they're doing now.
[01:37:29.417 --> 01:37:34.959]  And this Terry Schiavo case, you know, these people are committing murder, and they're going to have to stand before God, too.
[01:37:34.999 --> 01:37:37.339]  And I'm glad I'm not standing in their shoes when they do.
[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:42.101]  Well, you know, it's about what they're doing to Terry.
[01:37:43.266 --> 01:37:52.772]  But the other cases that the Wall Street Journal has reported on, people begging, please give me water, and they just tie them down and kill them.
[01:37:52.812 --> 01:37:54.773]  I mean, the average person doesn't know that's going on.
[01:37:55.734 --> 01:37:56.735]  It's not a secret, though.
[01:37:56.795 --> 01:37:58.055]  It's been in the big newspapers.
[01:37:58.296 --> 01:38:04.399]  And then you go to these nursing homes, and, you know, just like, well, my father died two years ago.
[01:38:04.419 --> 01:38:09.963]  He died a pretty horrible death, but I couldn't believe, you know, here at $6,000 a month, there's probably a lot more of it.
[01:38:10.622 --> 01:38:13.124]  It's just a lie there and very little care.
[01:38:15.765 --> 01:38:16.565]  It's incredible.
[01:38:17.906 --> 01:38:24.690]  If you've got to put your parents in a nursing home, if you've got to do it, you need to be there every day, folks.
[01:38:26.331 --> 01:38:33.535]  I have to commend my aunt and uncle when my grandfather had to go in a nursing home for the last six months of his life.
[01:38:34.806 --> 01:38:37.147]  Because, you know, he was just totally incapacitated.
[01:38:37.167 --> 01:38:39.769]  His mind was still there, his body wasn't.
[01:38:40.349 --> 01:38:41.650]  He went there every day.
[01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:47.292]  And, you know, our parents wiped our bottoms.
[01:38:48.133 --> 01:38:50.494]  Our parents picked up our puke.
[01:38:51.114 --> 01:38:55.076]  Our parents loved us and honored us.
[01:38:55.256 --> 01:38:59.118]  And to not take care of your parents, to not...
[01:39:00.854 --> 01:39:02.715]  Spend time with your parents.
[01:39:02.955 --> 01:39:04.995]  It just shows how sick we are.
[01:39:05.055 --> 01:39:12.917]  And these yuppies warehouse their folks, let them die of the bed sores, the rest of it, while they're out playing golf.
[01:39:12.977 --> 01:39:16.138]  And don't they know their little scumbag kids are going to do the same thing to them?
[01:39:16.158 --> 01:39:20.239]  I mean, it's just... God help us.
[01:39:20.279 --> 01:39:21.980]  We're worse than animals.
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:23.840]  We really are scum.
[01:39:23.860 --> 01:39:24.661]  Thanks for the call.
[01:39:25.381 --> 01:39:26.821]  And you know, somebody has to say it.
[01:39:27.061 --> 01:39:29.362]  And look, I've been working...
[01:39:30.914 --> 01:39:31.795]  No exaggeration.
[01:39:31.855 --> 01:39:33.456]  I worked 20 hours yesterday.
[01:39:35.398 --> 01:39:38.280]  And I didn't take any stimulants to do it other than two cups of coffee.
[01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:43.804]  A cup of coffee in the morning and a cup of coffee at about 10 o'clock at night trying to finish this film.
[01:39:43.825 --> 01:39:49.489]  Because I know I'm not going to be here forever and I need to get these type of works out.
[01:39:51.811 --> 01:39:54.593]  And I got home and I guess it's for not sleeping enough.
[01:39:54.733 --> 01:39:58.156]  I've always been able to go to sleep right away and I laid there and I didn't sleep last night.
[01:39:58.937 --> 01:40:00.438]  I just rolled around in bed and
[01:40:02.714 --> 01:40:08.178]  I just thought about my grandmother that died, my grandfathers that died.
[01:40:08.238 --> 01:40:10.179]  I thought about dogs I had that died.
[01:40:10.199 --> 01:40:14.863]  I thought about life, how short it is.
[01:40:14.883 --> 01:40:18.386]  I thought about shooting stars, how they're just there for a second.
[01:40:19.486 --> 01:40:21.348]  I thought about my children.
[01:40:21.388 --> 01:40:28.393]  I thought about, my God, I've got to do everything I can to give them a better world and not let them live in this cesspit the globalists are creating.
[01:40:29.164 --> 01:40:30.245]  You think it's bad now?
[01:40:30.285 --> 01:40:32.106]  The mouth of hell is just now opening.
[01:40:33.627 --> 01:40:34.468]  And I don't know.
[01:40:34.768 --> 01:40:36.169]  I just did not really sleep.
[01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:40.291]  I guess about... I got home about 3 o'clock.
[01:40:41.072 --> 01:40:45.875]  Couldn't go to bed, I guess, until about 6, 7 o'clock.
[01:40:46.415 --> 01:40:48.497]  My wife said, get up, get up, get up.
[01:40:49.437 --> 01:40:50.938]  Got to go do a radio interview.
[01:40:54.321 --> 01:40:56.322]  And I don't feel bad today not sleeping.
[01:40:57.102 --> 01:40:57.463]  I just...
[01:40:59.454 --> 01:41:03.016]  Well, I started this whole story because I haven't been visiting my sole remaining grandparent.
[01:41:04.997 --> 01:41:06.037]  Eighty-something years old.
[01:41:06.097 --> 01:41:11.560]  I spent a week with her at Christmas when I went on a vacation once, and I haven't been on a week-long vacation in five or six years.
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:16.382]  And I saw her at my birthday was last week, so she came over for that.
[01:41:16.402 --> 01:41:17.843]  I mentioned that.
[01:41:17.983 --> 01:41:19.924]  But I need to go see her more often.
[01:41:23.465 --> 01:41:26.247]  You know, she's got breast cancer.
[01:41:26.287 --> 01:41:27.087]  We need to pray for her.
[01:41:28.614 --> 01:41:32.055]  So here I am saying, you know, spend time with your parents.
[01:41:32.635 --> 01:41:34.075]  I need to spend more time with my grandmother.
[01:41:35.316 --> 01:41:36.116]  I just have to do more.
[01:41:37.256 --> 01:41:39.117]  It's just, so I don't want to be a hypocrite.
[01:41:40.997 --> 01:41:42.597]  I just, God help us.
[01:41:43.738 --> 01:41:44.978]  I mean, folks, it's bad.
[01:41:45.638 --> 01:41:47.739]  The globalists are really bad people.
[01:41:47.859 --> 01:41:54.800]  I mean, they openly talk about how they want to kill 85 to 95 percent of us in their own publications, and they know you're not reading their publications.
[01:41:55.660 --> 01:41:56.081]  It's sick.
[01:41:57.021 --> 01:41:57.681]  So God help us.
[01:41:58.771 --> 01:42:00.852]  Let's talk to Eric in Texas.
[01:42:00.912 --> 01:42:01.592]  Eric, go ahead.
[01:42:01.612 --> 01:42:03.172]  Hey, Alex.
[01:42:03.572 --> 01:42:03.993]  How you doing?
[01:42:04.313 --> 01:42:04.613]  Pretty good.
[01:42:05.553 --> 01:42:08.394]  Yeah, their goal is to try to separate our families.
[01:42:08.434 --> 01:42:11.235]  That's what we've got to keep in our forefront.
[01:42:11.495 --> 01:42:12.175]  Speak up for me.
[01:42:12.495 --> 01:42:13.195]  I'm sorry.
[01:42:13.215 --> 01:42:15.176]  We've got to keep our families in the forefront all the time.
[01:42:15.196 --> 01:42:16.816]  That's what they try to do, separate our families.
[01:42:16.836 --> 01:42:18.677]  That's all we're going to have, keep our blood.
[01:42:18.697 --> 01:42:19.697]  That's all we've got.
[01:42:19.937 --> 01:42:20.617]  Yep.
[01:42:20.717 --> 01:42:26.619]  Wayne was talking about the two witnesses, and that's in Mark 13, Matthew 24, Luke 21.
[01:42:28.228 --> 01:42:28.708]  And you're right.
[01:42:28.729 --> 01:42:35.434]  You've got to have the Bible at the forefront.
[01:42:35.475 --> 01:42:44.643]  I called about what's happened on the thing with the Boys Town with Johnny Gosch and Jeff Gannon.
[01:42:46.284 --> 01:42:47.285]  Those are the same people.
[01:42:49.287 --> 01:42:51.649]  And it has also Warren Buffett.
[01:42:53.109 --> 01:42:59.171]  Well, everybody keeps calling about this, and I really can't get into it because I haven't studied the particulars of what you're talking about, sir.
[01:42:59.591 --> 01:43:02.032]  Okay, well, it's... I mean, what news report is this?
[01:43:02.072 --> 01:43:02.812]  What are you talking about?
[01:43:03.032 --> 01:43:06.934]  Well, I heard it off of Skolnick.
[01:43:07.234 --> 01:43:08.734]  Do you know who that is?
[01:43:08.754 --> 01:43:09.614]  Yeah, Sherman Skolnick.
[01:43:09.634 --> 01:43:09.895]  Yeah.
[01:43:10.255 --> 01:43:11.115]  Is he credible?
[01:43:13.956 --> 01:43:15.116]  He's done a lot of good reporting.
[01:43:15.156 --> 01:43:16.457]  I mean, some of it I can't confirm.
[01:43:17.117 --> 01:43:17.337]  Okay.
[01:43:19.275 --> 01:43:22.296]  I'm not going to censor you, but I'll promise you this.
[01:43:22.837 --> 01:43:30.699]  I'll make my best attempt to go research these claims and then try to talk about it, but I really don't want to go into stuff that I haven't confirmed.
[01:43:30.719 --> 01:43:31.539]  That's very interesting.
[01:43:31.559 --> 01:43:33.080]  I'd like to know more about it.
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:36.901]  Is your opinion the same as it was a couple weeks ago about Ward Churchill?
[01:43:38.722 --> 01:43:38.982]  Yes.
[01:43:39.362 --> 01:43:40.062]  Okay.
[01:43:40.862 --> 01:43:41.302]  I didn't know.
[01:43:42.443 --> 01:43:45.844]  I haven't heard of him until you mentioned him, and then I have free speech television.
[01:43:46.679 --> 01:43:48.180]  And he's been on there a lot.
[01:43:49.041 --> 01:43:51.443]  He doesn't know everything about the U.N.
[01:43:51.503 --> 01:43:52.004]  and stuff.
[01:43:52.724 --> 01:43:54.226]  I don't think he's a CIA agent.
[01:43:54.566 --> 01:43:56.948]  I mean, I don't know about that.
[01:43:56.968 --> 01:43:59.490]  Well, no, I just said he fits the mold.
[01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:07.397]  And for those who don't know, he's the professor from Colorado who I've seen locally here in Austin when he came to speak and see him on TV.
[01:44:07.417 --> 01:44:08.017]  He's a bully.
[01:44:08.037 --> 01:44:08.477]  He's a bully.
[01:44:08.558 --> 01:44:09.879]  I agree with that.
[01:44:10.119 --> 01:44:12.641]  So you've seen how... Yeah, he's really bullish.
[01:44:12.681 --> 01:44:13.302]  But I think he has...
[01:44:15.362 --> 01:44:22.128]  I think he has good intentions in his heart, but I don't think that he definitely doesn't know the whole story.
[01:44:22.148 --> 01:44:26.071]  Well, for those that just joined us who are in the dark right now, let me just remind them who he is.
[01:44:26.251 --> 01:44:26.471]  Okay.
[01:44:27.512 --> 01:44:30.094]  He said that the people weren't innocent who died in the towers.
[01:44:30.134 --> 01:44:30.835]  They were Nazis.
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:34.421]  Al-Qaeda are basically freedom fighters.
[01:44:34.981 --> 01:44:36.181]  And that is so bad.
[01:44:36.241 --> 01:44:37.462]  It is bad.
[01:44:37.742 --> 01:44:39.982]  At so many different levels, and I appreciate your call.
[01:44:40.382 --> 01:44:43.723]  Since you raised it, Eric, let me just talk about it briefly.
[01:44:44.084 --> 01:44:44.304]  Thank you.
[01:44:44.804 --> 01:44:45.164]  Thank you.
[01:44:45.604 --> 01:44:49.685]  Number one, it's not Al-Qaeda, it's Al-Ciata.
[01:44:51.666 --> 01:44:55.127]  Number one, it's not Al-Qaeda, it's Al-Ciata.
[01:44:56.367 --> 01:44:59.408]  And the whole left in this country, large portions of it,
[01:45:00.510 --> 01:45:07.475]  That, oh, it was a popular uprising of the impoverished and downtrodden against the evil corporations and the capitalists.
[01:45:08.916 --> 01:45:12.759]  And Al-Qaeda struck against the heart of America's arrogance.
[01:45:15.001 --> 01:45:21.766]  And the people that died were Nazis and weren't innocent.
[01:45:23.427 --> 01:45:27.610]  The people in there working on the lighting systems, the people working on the furnaces, the people...
[01:45:28.724 --> 01:45:39.936]  You know, all the hundreds of secretaries, the janitor, you know, the Korean War vet is still working as a janitor, 70-something years old.
[01:45:41.238 --> 01:45:42.599]  They did not deserve to die.
[01:45:42.779 --> 01:45:44.261]  Now, number one, they didn't deserve to die.
[01:45:44.681 --> 01:45:48.606]  But most importantly, Al-Qaeda is a CIA creation.
[01:45:50.965 --> 01:45:55.126]  The Arabs on board the aircraft were government agents who thought they were part of a drill.
[01:45:55.186 --> 01:45:57.787]  Nerve gas was released and the planes were flown into the buildings.
[01:45:58.147 --> 01:45:59.727]  Now that's just what happened, okay?
[01:46:00.047 --> 01:46:01.388]  I've got a thousand pieces of evidence.
[01:46:01.428 --> 01:46:02.568]  I've gone over it over and over again.
[01:46:02.808 --> 01:46:04.689]  It's as clear as the nose on my face.
[01:46:04.769 --> 01:46:05.269]  It's a fact.
[01:46:06.329 --> 01:46:08.870]  Perhaps next hour in ten minutes I'll go over what really happened on 9-11.
[01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:10.630]  It's important to do that on occasion.
[01:46:10.950 --> 01:46:13.511]  I'll kind of give you a summation as I did on a St.
[01:46:13.551 --> 01:46:14.871]  Louis radio station this morning.
[01:46:14.911 --> 01:46:16.172]  It's important that we understand this.
[01:46:16.432 --> 01:46:17.372]  We now know what happened.
[01:46:19.168 --> 01:46:23.873]  And then Bin Laden takes a little bit of the blame for it, you know, puts out some propaganda that's half-believable.
[01:46:24.954 --> 01:46:29.698]  Number one, Kibono, as they say, as the Romans would say, when they were having a trial.
[01:46:29.978 --> 01:46:31.060]  Who stands to gain?
[01:46:31.360 --> 01:46:32.641]  Who has motive?
[01:46:32.981 --> 01:46:36.064]  Who profits, is the literal translation.
[01:46:36.385 --> 01:46:36.885]  Kibono.
[01:46:39.107 --> 01:46:40.428]  Who stands to gain?
[01:46:40.749 --> 01:46:41.670]  Kibono.
[01:46:42.170 --> 01:46:42.971]  Kibono.
[01:46:43.849 --> 01:46:52.315]  Now, do you think Iraq and Iran and Syria stood the gain from flying hijacked jets into buildings knowing it would bring down the total wrath?
[01:46:52.876 --> 01:46:53.876]  Well, no, it wouldn't.
[01:46:55.517 --> 01:47:03.343]  And they said the CIA did it day one, and that Al-Qaeda's CIA, and if they catch Al-Qaeda in their country, they cut their heads off immediately and say publicly, CIA agent, die!
[01:47:04.424 --> 01:47:04.584]  Now...
[01:47:07.375 --> 01:47:15.879]  Going back, PNAC, with Dick Cheney writing the memos publicly, did say, we need terror attacks, helpful Pearl Harbor events to get these people mobilized.
[01:47:15.959 --> 01:47:26.463]  Brzezinski said, to control our slaves, he called the slaves, best-selling book, I hate to plug it all the time, Grand Chessboard, he said, the American people are our slaves, he says it, are our slaves.
[01:47:28.944 --> 01:47:32.926]  And to control them, we've got to have terror attacks in America on the order of Pearl Harbor.
[01:47:34.392 --> 01:47:36.174]  Now, see, the globalists have the motive.
[01:47:36.194 --> 01:47:39.277]  Then we look at who did 9-11, and sure enough, those with the motive did it.
[01:47:41.359 --> 01:47:46.204]  And so word Churchill, that punk, I'd like to see him get in my face and shove me.
[01:47:47.205 --> 01:47:48.447]  I don't like big bullies.
[01:47:49.047 --> 01:47:51.149]  Just something about big guys getting in my face.
[01:47:51.650 --> 01:47:53.572]  But the point is, is that
[01:47:55.006 --> 01:47:56.207]  You saw the scene when he was here in town.
[01:47:56.247 --> 01:47:57.988]  Friends of mine, he was just being real rude to them.
[01:47:58.148 --> 01:47:59.889]  You're an idiot!
[01:47:59.930 --> 01:48:01.711]  Just totally, but it was the spirit of it.
[01:48:01.731 --> 01:48:02.691]  I mean, I'm obnoxious too.
[01:48:03.052 --> 01:48:03.772]  Everybody's a little bit.
[01:48:03.792 --> 01:48:04.953]  It's just the way he does it.
[01:48:04.993 --> 01:48:06.654]  It's a relish of it.
[01:48:07.095 --> 01:48:10.337]  You know, to say, oh, Al-Qaeda were freedom fighters when they attacked us.
[01:48:10.417 --> 01:48:13.979]  And yeah, it was a strike against the people in those towers.
[01:48:14.380 --> 01:48:16.041]  That plays into the whole paradigm.
[01:48:18.142 --> 01:48:19.483]  That was a government op.
[01:48:20.144 --> 01:48:21.885]  And you'd have to be an idiot not to know it.
[01:48:22.475 --> 01:48:24.656]  I mean, I've had German defense ministers on.
[01:48:24.716 --> 01:48:28.678]  I've had former top CIA analysts for the whole CIA on saying it.
[01:48:29.078 --> 01:48:32.300]  I mean, anybody with a brain, folks, knows.
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:37.063]  I've had military officers on, airline pilots on, air traffic controllers on.
[01:48:37.103 --> 01:48:40.624]  Anybody with a brain knows the official story is impossible and is a fraud.
[01:48:42.025 --> 01:48:43.866]  Let's talk to Jack in Texas.
[01:48:43.946 --> 01:48:44.706]  Jack, go ahead.
[01:48:45.027 --> 01:48:45.627]  Hello, Alex.
[01:48:45.947 --> 01:48:46.407]  How you doing?
[01:48:46.768 --> 01:48:47.528]  I'm well, bud.
[01:48:47.588 --> 01:48:50.590]  I know you hear this a million times during your show, but thanks for all you do.
[01:48:50.830 --> 01:48:51.290]  Well, thank you.
[01:48:51.664 --> 01:48:59.611]  Under the heading of all the cameras they're watching us with, particularly on the superhighways and the freeways, particularly in Dallas and Houston, they've got a camera.
[01:49:00.572 --> 01:49:09.901]  Now they've added two years ago a little device about half that size, kind of looks like a camera on a pole, usually just the other side flow direction of the camera.
[01:49:10.301 --> 01:49:11.903]  It's pointed down towards the ground.
[01:49:12.463 --> 01:49:13.404]  Not sure what that is.
[01:49:13.945 --> 01:49:17.528]  Now in Dallas, Fort Worth, they've added another pole
[01:49:18.825 --> 01:49:23.588]  It's an octagon galvanized pole 25 to 30 feet in the air with just an antenna on it.
[01:49:24.269 --> 01:49:27.431]  Let me just stay there and I'll tell folks about all this when we get back.
[01:49:27.451 --> 01:49:27.771]  All right.
[01:49:28.171 --> 01:49:29.672]  You have antenna arrays.
[01:49:30.613 --> 01:49:31.533]  Well, this is something else.
[01:49:31.573 --> 01:49:32.434]  Come back and I'll tell you.
[01:49:32.634 --> 01:49:33.094]  Yeah.
[01:49:33.314 --> 01:49:33.795]  Okay.
[01:49:33.835 --> 01:49:34.975]  I'm just going to go over what they have.
[01:49:35.015 --> 01:49:36.977]  They have cameras that scan license plates.
[01:49:37.477 --> 01:49:40.619]  They have cameras that read optical barcodes that they're now...
[01:49:41.372 --> 01:49:44.756]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:44.776 --> 01:49:48.439]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:04.801 --> 01:50:07.443]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[01:50:07.503 --> 01:50:10.326]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:50:10.566 --> 01:50:14.810]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:21.816]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.916 --> 01:50:23.938]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:24.158 --> 01:50:34.741]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:40.322]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:50:40.803 --> 01:50:43.423]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:50:43.443 --> 01:50:44.024]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.044 --> 01:50:44.544]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:44.564 --> 01:50:45.864]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:50:53.306 --> 01:51:01.548]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:51:01.808 --> 01:51:06.168]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:51:06.469 --> 01:51:15.370]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:51:15.570 --> 01:51:19.191]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:51:19.491 --> 01:51:24.519]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:51:24.819 --> 01:51:31.570]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:51:32.051 --> 01:51:32.592]  What about you?

[01:52:54.996 --> 01:52:58.057]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents
[01:53:00.845 --> 01:53:03.206]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:04.647 --> 01:53:15.712]  All right, let's go back and let Jack in Texas tell us about these new devices.
[01:53:15.752 --> 01:53:16.352]  Go ahead, Jack.
[01:53:17.492 --> 01:53:20.214]  Alex, it's a pole, 35, 25 feet high.
[01:53:20.334 --> 01:53:21.894]  It's got only an antenna on it.
[01:53:21.914 --> 01:53:23.395]  They've not installed the device.
[01:53:24.115 --> 01:53:24.816]  I know, I've seen them.
[01:53:26.508 --> 01:53:32.809]  I'm wondering if there's not a connection between that and we all know they're going to perpetrate another event, probably declare martial law.
[01:53:33.529 --> 01:53:39.811]  And I'm wondering if the timing of this instrument being installed would be an insight to when that's going to occur.
[01:53:40.151 --> 01:53:42.071]  Well, did you hear me right before 9-11?
[01:53:42.131 --> 01:53:47.292]  I reported that thousands of cameras were shipped into warehouses in Austin and prepared.
[01:53:47.772 --> 01:53:48.332]  Yeah.
[01:53:48.432 --> 01:53:52.053]  And then within weeks after it happening, they went up to the neighborhoods everywhere.
[01:53:52.453 --> 01:53:52.593]  Right.
[01:53:52.613 --> 01:53:53.614]  I said, oh, it's because of 9-11.
[01:53:53.634 --> 01:53:53.774]  Well...
[01:53:56.497 --> 01:53:57.258]  I'm suspecting.
[01:53:57.298 --> 01:53:58.059]  I'll tell you what I'll do.
[01:53:58.139 --> 01:53:59.460]  I travel these routes every day.
[01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:04.164]  They're on the Dallas North Toll Road, they're on George Bush, and they're starting to move them along LBJ.
[01:54:04.725 --> 01:54:05.625]  I'll keep an eye out.
[01:54:05.685 --> 01:54:08.108]  Now, are those right next to already existing cameras?
[01:54:08.228 --> 01:54:11.791]  They're generally putting them isolated by themselves, which is curious to me.
[01:54:11.831 --> 01:54:14.513]  Well, I've talked to some of the technicians putting these in.
[01:54:14.573 --> 01:54:17.556]  Those are normally wireless transmitter towers.
[01:54:18.057 --> 01:54:21.580]  Do they have a lug point?
[01:54:22.140 --> 01:54:23.963]  A blister point to put in a... No.
[01:54:24.223 --> 01:54:25.606]  No, there's no access panel.
[01:54:25.626 --> 01:54:26.727]  There's no blister point.
[01:54:26.827 --> 01:54:31.294]  It's a smooth, tapering, octagonal pole, galvanized, 25 feet high.
[01:54:31.635 --> 01:54:32.877]  It's got a flat top on it.
[01:54:32.897 --> 01:54:34.038]  It's got a receiving plate.
[01:54:34.399 --> 01:54:36.362]  And it's got a four-foot antenna on it.
[01:54:36.402 --> 01:54:37.504]  They're all identical.
[01:54:38.104 --> 01:54:42.790]  None of them have any instruments installed, and they're the recent addition to go up behind the cameras.
[01:54:43.051 --> 01:54:48.237]  Well, they've already put in the little radio readers to read our transponder tags we're all going to be fitted with soon.
[01:54:48.558 --> 01:54:49.078]  Okay.
[01:54:49.319 --> 01:54:52.142]  The one that's at an angle, they're all at the exact same angle.
[01:54:52.182 --> 01:54:53.144]  They point right down.
[01:54:53.764 --> 01:54:58.448]  To the ground, to the pavement, and they're usually about 50 feet beyond the cameras in the flow direction.
[01:54:58.688 --> 01:55:01.850]  Yeah, those are the transponder readers normally.
[01:55:02.111 --> 01:55:03.672]  Well, one night, they put them in at night.
[01:55:03.752 --> 01:55:09.276]  I stopped, pulled over, and went up and tried to talk to these guys, and they didn't want anything to do with it.
[01:55:09.416 --> 01:55:11.458]  Whoever's installing them under the subcontract.
[01:55:13.019 --> 01:55:14.140]  Well, it's all part of freedom.
[01:55:14.520 --> 01:55:15.361]  Yeah, isn't it though?
[01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:16.842]  But we can't have that on the border.
[01:55:17.375 --> 01:55:20.158]  Well, I'm going to keep an eye on these things as soon as they install one.
[01:55:20.178 --> 01:55:24.181]  They're also starting to put up concrete dividers down the middle of George Bush.
[01:55:24.702 --> 01:55:25.863]  They never had them before.
[01:55:26.363 --> 01:55:27.745]  There wasn't any reason to put them up.
[01:55:27.765 --> 01:55:30.587]  There's been a few head-on crashes, people crossing the median.
[01:55:30.988 --> 01:55:32.929]  But I've noticed around here, I'll keep monitoring.
[01:55:32.949 --> 01:55:36.993]  Well, you know when they pile them up at key intersections, they admit that's to block cities off.
[01:55:37.393 --> 01:55:41.197]  Well, and to keep you from crossing over in case you see a roadblock coming up ahead.
[01:55:42.082 --> 01:55:42.983]  It's all part of freedom.
[01:55:43.323 --> 01:55:43.663]  Oh, yeah.
[01:55:43.763 --> 01:55:44.783]  I'll keep an eye on these polls.
[01:55:44.864 --> 01:55:46.184]  I'll report back to you.
[01:55:46.364 --> 01:55:46.905]  Thank you, sir.
[01:55:46.945 --> 01:55:47.865]  I appreciate the call.
[01:55:48.245 --> 01:55:49.266]  We'll start the third hour.
[01:55:49.286 --> 01:55:52.608]  We're going to do a bunch of other news and continue with your calls.
[01:55:52.728 --> 01:55:55.609]  Kim and Jonathan and TJ and Chris and others.
[01:55:56.890 --> 01:55:59.351]  The last minute and a half left I've got in this hour.
[01:56:00.332 --> 01:56:11.478]  I really, again, want to encourage every single solitary one of you out there that hasn't gotten my videos, that hasn't made copies of them, that hasn't gotten them out, the friends and family and opinion makers in your area,
[01:56:12.955 --> 01:56:22.238]  But really strongly consider writing down this toll-free number on this website and calling the number or going to the website or writing to me and getting 9-11, the Road to Tyranny.
[01:56:22.958 --> 01:56:24.718]  We need to expose who carried out 9-11.
[01:56:24.738 --> 01:56:27.479]  The perpetrators need to be brought to justice, and Road to Tyranny does that.
[01:56:28.079 --> 01:56:29.199]  So does Masters of Terror.
[01:56:29.239 --> 01:56:31.080]  My new film, American Dictators, is excellent.
[01:56:32.683 --> 01:56:37.786]  So many big specials I'm offering right now where you buy one video at the regular price, you buy another for $5.95.
[01:56:38.287 --> 01:56:39.727]  I mean, just crazy deals.
[01:56:40.268 --> 01:56:42.389]  Because I just want to get the information out to the people.
[01:56:42.829 --> 01:56:45.251]  Go to infowars.com.
[01:56:45.271 --> 01:56:49.894]  That's I-N-F-O-W-A-R-S.com or prisonplanet.com.
[01:56:50.954 --> 01:56:52.976]  And go to the Safe Secure online shopping carts.
[01:56:53.056 --> 01:56:53.696]  Peruse them.
[01:56:53.756 --> 01:56:54.977]  Watch free clips of the films.
[01:56:55.457 --> 01:56:56.018]  Read about them.
[01:56:56.038 --> 01:56:58.239]  Look at all the different specials and order them today.
[01:56:58.925 --> 01:57:00.986]  We're called toll-free 24 hours a day.
[01:57:01.006 --> 01:57:02.827]  We've got great folks standing by.
[01:57:02.847 --> 01:57:03.267]  At 1-888-253-3139.
[01:57:03.287 --> 01:57:03.668]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:57:03.708 --> 01:57:05.389]  Many hands make light work.
[01:57:05.769 --> 01:57:08.470]  If you don't take action, who will?
[01:57:08.490 --> 01:57:10.592]  You can also write to me at 3001...
[01:57:23.064 --> 01:57:29.206]  That's 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:57:31.267 --> 01:57:33.567]  Third hour of global transmission against tyranny.
[01:57:34.288 --> 01:57:35.068]  Straight ahead.
[01:57:35.088 --> 01:57:40.750]  So please stay with us.
[01:57:40.770 --> 01:57:41.430]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.826 --> 01:57:55.749]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.490 --> 01:57:57.471]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.051 --> 01:58:01.734]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.234 --> 01:58:06.317]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:18.152 --> 01:58:21.494]  If the globalists strike me down, they'll just send me to my creator.
[01:58:23.695 --> 01:58:28.958]  The disease of the New World Order, like a cancer, is spread across the face of the world.
[01:58:28.978 --> 01:58:32.720]  They must recognize the disease for what it is and stand up against it.
[01:58:34.121 --> 01:58:37.843]  The globalists think they have a right to rule us and control us because they are in control.
[01:58:38.303 --> 01:58:41.045]  And because of social Darwinism, that means survival of the fittest.
[01:58:41.085 --> 01:58:41.886]  It's their right.
[01:58:43.026 --> 01:58:46.168]  It's like a cancer thinks that it's its mindless right to
[01:58:47.088 --> 01:58:48.629]  To take over the body.
[01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:50.410]  No, that doesn't mean you're superior.
[01:58:50.470 --> 01:59:11.603]  It means you're an anomaly, a disease, an aberration, a fraud, a black blemish, a scum-filled system that is ripping the guts out of decency and honor and love and creativity.
[01:59:13.163 --> 01:59:15.625]  For every action, there is an equal or greater reaction
[01:59:16.579 --> 01:59:20.960]  And your corruption will be met when the enemy comes in like a flood.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:23.140]  The Spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against it.
[01:59:23.180 --> 01:59:26.561]  And you, my friends, are that standard if you'll only stand.
[01:59:27.721 --> 01:59:37.984]  And standing makes you a lot safer and makes things turn out a lot better at the end of the day than cowering mindlessly and going along with this or denying the New World Order's existence as it's upon us.
[01:59:38.764 --> 01:59:39.884]  Let's continue with your calls.
[01:59:39.944 --> 01:59:41.644]  And there's just so much other news coming out.
[01:59:41.684 --> 01:59:43.085]  But the calls are so interesting.
[01:59:43.585 --> 01:59:44.885]  Let's continue with those calls.
[01:59:45.754 --> 01:59:47.196]  Let's talk to Kim in Texas.
[01:59:47.236 --> 01:59:47.997]  Kim, go ahead.
[01:59:48.177 --> 01:59:49.158]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:59:49.498 --> 01:59:49.678]  Hello.
[01:59:50.359 --> 01:59:58.528]  I was wondering if you were aware of a new Texas bill that's going to require newborns to have 20 to 30 genetic tests.
[01:59:58.989 --> 02:00:01.171]  It was just introduced on the 9th of this month.
[02:00:02.347 --> 02:00:05.289]  No, there's always some new horrible nightmare that I'm not aware of.
[02:00:05.349 --> 02:00:10.732]  I know that the feds pay the state's mandate to take blood, and it isn't for blood testing.
[02:00:10.772 --> 02:00:12.152]  It goes into a DNA databank.
[02:00:12.573 --> 02:00:15.875]  If you're under 32 years of age, you're in the databank if you were born in the hospital.
[02:00:16.195 --> 02:00:17.535]  What's this new abomination?
[02:00:18.056 --> 02:00:27.481]  Well, it's House Bill 790, and basically they're taking... I don't know, are you familiar with the American College of Medical Genetics?
[02:00:30.495 --> 02:00:30.755]  Yes.
[02:00:30.995 --> 02:00:33.697]  Because basically, they're taking their recommendations.
[02:00:34.318 --> 02:00:37.580]  And, you know, it's real... Actually, I emailed the bill to you.
[02:00:38.140 --> 02:00:40.161]  And as usual, it's real vague.
[02:00:40.181 --> 02:00:43.604]  I mean, it says... Basically, it says we can test you for whatever we want to.
[02:00:44.104 --> 02:00:45.125]  Whenever we want to.
[02:00:45.205 --> 02:00:46.365]  I mean, your newborn children.
[02:00:46.385 --> 02:00:47.886]  You know, if you read it.
[02:00:47.906 --> 02:00:52.269]  Which actually, again, starts setting the law for inoculation for everything.
[02:00:52.890 --> 02:00:54.611]  Yeah, I mean, I can just read one little part.
[02:00:54.651 --> 02:00:59.214]  It says the department shall require a newborn screening test to screen for disorders detectable...
[02:01:00.046 --> 02:01:02.509]  And then they'll say that it's an at-risk... Or any other report.
[02:01:02.529 --> 02:01:04.332]  Then they'll say it's an at-risk child.
[02:01:12.279 --> 02:01:17.864]  Right, and then they label you because they want to give you special, you know, they're going to give something to you.
[02:01:17.904 --> 02:01:18.865]  That's the way it goes on.
[02:01:18.925 --> 02:01:24.050]  And then, of course, in England they're talking about looking at embryos before they're even born and deciding you can have the child.
[02:01:24.090 --> 02:01:26.392]  Why, this shows you have aggressive genetics.
[02:01:26.432 --> 02:01:27.253]  We can't have that.
[02:01:27.473 --> 02:01:28.714]  And isn't there a movie like this?
[02:01:28.734 --> 02:01:32.217]  It's called Gattaca or something of that nature where they test you when you're born.
[02:01:32.437 --> 02:01:32.738]  Yeah.
[02:01:33.198 --> 02:01:33.418]  Right.
[02:01:34.019 --> 02:01:37.142]  And now what scumbag introduced this bill?
[02:01:37.862 --> 02:01:38.463]  Crownover.
[02:01:40.262 --> 02:01:42.284]  Is Crown over a Democrat or Republican?
[02:01:42.324 --> 02:01:42.924]  No, I don't know.
[02:01:42.964 --> 02:01:43.745]  I didn't look yet.
[02:01:43.865 --> 02:01:44.765]  I just pulled this up.
[02:01:44.826 --> 02:01:51.571]  I just heard it on the news last night, and thanks to the fact that I only have dial-up, it takes me a while to get to this stuff.
[02:01:51.891 --> 02:01:53.892]  Send it to tips at infowars.com.
[02:01:53.912 --> 02:01:55.534]  Yeah, I already sent it to you, Alex.
[02:01:57.235 --> 02:02:05.321]  I purchased the article from the American College of Medical Genetics, and I'll just mail that to you.
[02:02:05.661 --> 02:02:08.063]  For some reason, I can't email it.
[02:02:08.103 --> 02:02:09.084]  I guess because I had to buy it.
[02:02:09.915 --> 02:02:11.997]  You've got to put it into a different format.
[02:02:12.317 --> 02:02:12.877]  Oh, okay.
[02:02:13.298 --> 02:02:17.601]  So, it's just, we're going to test you for all these new genetic diseases.
[02:02:18.082 --> 02:02:19.122]  Basically, that's it.
[02:02:19.703 --> 02:02:23.206]  Yeah, and then they're going to give you entitlements if you have one of these things.
[02:02:23.266 --> 02:02:26.088]  And of course, the insurance companies won't give you any insurance either.
[02:02:27.149 --> 02:02:29.591]  Oh yeah, that's probably being sponsored by them.
[02:02:30.031 --> 02:02:30.492]  Probably.
[02:02:30.512 --> 02:02:34.595]  And of course, hundreds of these so-called genetic diseases never manifest.
[02:02:36.259 --> 02:02:37.499]  Man, this is incredible.
[02:02:37.539 --> 02:02:38.100]  Anything else?
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:38.920]  No, that's it.
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:39.520]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:40.440]  Wow, thank you.
[02:02:46.342 --> 02:02:53.724]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.984 --> 02:02:58.725]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.945 --> 02:03:04.587]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.827 --> 02:03:05.588]  We're good to go.
[02:03:32.105 --> 02:03:32.545]  1-888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139
[02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:48.434]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.474 --> 02:03:52.657]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:52.897 --> 02:03:55.699]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:55.899 --> 02:03:58.281]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.481 --> 02:04:07.128]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.328 --> 02:04:08.669]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:04:08.869 --> 02:04:13.012]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.012 --> 02:04:13.652]  We're good to go.
[02:04:45.033 --> 02:04:47.394]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:04:47.655 --> 02:04:51.497]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:04:51.817 --> 02:04:52.637]  Read the labels.
[02:04:53.057 --> 02:04:57.160]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:04:57.400 --> 02:05:01.602]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:05:01.962 --> 02:05:06.845]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:05:07.225 --> 02:05:10.807]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:05:10.987 --> 02:05:16.329]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:05:16.609 --> 02:05:19.350]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:05:19.630 --> 02:05:20.530]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:05:34.396 --> 02:05:34.957]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:52.441]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.141 --> 02:05:54.242]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.902 --> 02:05:55.762]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.483 --> 02:05:57.403]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.423 --> 02:06:01.865]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.246 --> 02:06:06.348]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:10.590 --> 02:06:13.771]  Alright, 8 minutes, 25 seconds into this third hour.
[02:06:14.192 --> 02:06:17.733]  Thank you for joining us on this Wednesday.
[02:06:17.753 --> 02:06:20.915]  Well, sometimes on Thursday edition.
[02:06:21.716 --> 02:06:27.739]  Wide open phones, continuing with your phone calls, and then coming up a little bit later, patrol cars to be tracked by satellites.
[02:06:27.779 --> 02:06:32.942]  See, they do it to the enforcers first, and then they don't mind enforcing it on you.
[02:06:33.943 --> 02:06:38.225]  Pakistan may use nukes against India, the CIA is now saying.
[02:06:38.245 --> 02:06:40.366]  That's just some of the reports that are coming up.
[02:06:40.386 --> 02:06:42.647]  But let's continue with your phone calls right now.
[02:06:43.328 --> 02:06:45.689]  Johanna in Texas, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:06:48.170 --> 02:06:49.311]  Good to talk to you, Johanna.
[02:06:50.399 --> 02:06:50.779]  All right.
[02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:51.840]  Johanna's gone.
[02:06:52.201 --> 02:06:53.442]  TJ in Minnesota.
[02:06:53.742 --> 02:06:54.923]  TJ, you're on the air.
[02:06:54.983 --> 02:06:55.464]  Go ahead.
[02:06:55.484 --> 02:06:56.345]  Hi, Alex.
[02:06:56.645 --> 02:06:56.965]  Hello.
[02:06:57.325 --> 02:06:58.847]  You know, when I call, it's important.
[02:07:01.750 --> 02:07:03.511]  Anyhow, I think it was Sunday.
[02:07:04.392 --> 02:07:05.373]  I was half asleep.
[02:07:05.953 --> 02:07:14.942]  My focus is usually spray planes and helicopters, but I had an AM, Amplitude Modulation, radio station on, and I heard George Bush's voice.
[02:07:16.551 --> 02:07:21.634]  And it was a tape recording of a telephone conversation he had prior to one of his elections.
[02:07:21.914 --> 02:07:22.794]  Do you know about this?
[02:07:23.714 --> 02:07:27.496]  Yeah, this was all a Karl Rove plant to make him look more liberal.
[02:07:28.117 --> 02:07:28.617]  No, no, no.
[02:07:28.657 --> 02:07:36.541]  This was about... And to quote, move to the left, are you talking about the tape recordings that are now playing of him saying he wants to be nice to the gays?
[02:07:37.341 --> 02:07:37.681]  No.
[02:07:37.701 --> 02:07:38.882]  Oh, this is another tape.
[02:07:38.902 --> 02:07:44.444]  He was talking about drug usage, and then there was something that alluded to... Yeah, that's the same tape.
[02:07:44.504 --> 02:07:45.565]  ...to carnality.
[02:07:46.357 --> 02:07:52.662]  And then I thought, well, I better get some sleep because this will be hot news on shortwave and I don't want to miss any of it.
[02:07:52.782 --> 02:07:54.143]  Nobody's picked up on it.
[02:07:54.264 --> 02:07:54.604]  And then...
[02:07:57.031 --> 02:08:00.534]  You heard of this Jeff Gannon connection to Johnny Gosch?
[02:08:00.914 --> 02:08:03.136]  I don't know if it's rumor or factual, but I do know.
[02:08:03.156 --> 02:08:05.938]  Yeah, it just got brought up last hour, and I'm not going to get in the news.
[02:08:06.058 --> 02:08:07.159]  I haven't confirmed myself, sir.
[02:08:07.500 --> 02:08:15.506]  Okay, but you can confirm the number of trips the Bushes made to that, I think it's Cedar Rapids, Iowa, over the past few years.
[02:08:15.706 --> 02:08:16.547]  Phenomenal.
[02:08:17.354 --> 02:08:19.497]  And it became a standing joke down there.
[02:08:19.537 --> 02:08:20.838]  Let me just stop you, sir.
[02:08:21.339 --> 02:08:23.481]  We're not having a private conversation here on air.
[02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:29.969]  It's not just me and you at the restaurant hanging out or at the golf course where you and I know what we're talking about.
[02:08:29.989 --> 02:08:31.270]  Did I imply that, Alex?
[02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:32.832]  Sir, can I just stop you for a second?
[02:08:33.432 --> 02:08:34.353]  I'm going to stop you for a second.
[02:08:34.994 --> 02:08:36.516]  The first thing you mentioned...
[02:08:38.630 --> 02:08:49.757]  ...was about the tapes that got released where Bush admits drug use and he's a sinner too, and he wants to figure out a way to not have the Christian conservatives get mad at him, but to be nice to the gays.
[02:08:50.298 --> 02:09:02.786]  And yes, that is the same tapes that were released, and that was actually released on purpose by them, by the neocons, to make him look like more of just this average good guy who admits he's a sinner.
[02:09:03.286 --> 02:09:07.409]  It's totally manipulative, and we did mention it on Tuesday, but...
[02:09:08.449 --> 02:09:09.771]  Now, on that subject, that's it.
[02:09:10.171 --> 02:09:17.558]  Now stuff's coming out talking about the fake White House reporter and was he connected to the Franklin cover-up and all this stuff.
[02:09:17.618 --> 02:09:19.640]  And I don't know about all that.
[02:09:19.960 --> 02:09:21.141]  I can't prove that yet.
[02:09:21.181 --> 02:09:22.342]  I haven't had time to look at it.
[02:09:22.783 --> 02:09:28.348]  So I'm not going to sit here and say things about people that I don't know is true.
[02:09:28.768 --> 02:09:31.831]  And I'm not going to just say, is it a rumor, is it a... because that's not what I do.
[02:09:32.532 --> 02:09:32.752]  Okay?
[02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:38.590]  Well, that's all well understood before I ever bothered waiting on this phone line, Alex.
[02:09:38.970 --> 02:09:41.732]  But I've got to tell you also, I want... Now, you wait a minute.
[02:09:42.313 --> 02:09:42.833]  Put him on hold.
[02:09:42.993 --> 02:09:43.434]  Put him on hold.
[02:09:43.854 --> 02:09:44.214]  That's it.
[02:09:44.315 --> 02:09:44.695]  Let him go.
[02:09:45.996 --> 02:09:46.296]  Listen.
[02:09:47.057 --> 02:09:47.357]  Listen.
[02:09:47.977 --> 02:09:49.519]  I'm serious, folks.
[02:09:51.020 --> 02:10:00.728]  There's been a lot of stuff in the past by other broadcasters where they let people say things about other folks that isn't confirmed, and then it causes problems.
[02:10:01.889 --> 02:10:02.189]  All right?
[02:10:03.247 --> 02:10:07.070]  And look, if you don't like this talk show, TJ, just don't listen.
[02:10:07.530 --> 02:10:07.770]  All right?
[02:10:07.810 --> 02:10:09.011]  I don't want you listening to my show.
[02:10:09.412 --> 02:10:09.672]  All right?
[02:10:10.212 --> 02:10:10.452]  Good.
[02:10:10.853 --> 02:10:11.853]  Don't ever call here again.
[02:10:12.354 --> 02:10:12.574]  Good.
[02:10:13.074 --> 02:10:14.455]  Let's talk to Chris in Tennessee.
[02:10:14.515 --> 02:10:15.196]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:10:15.616 --> 02:10:16.216]  You're on the air.
[02:10:16.717 --> 02:10:17.177]  Hello, Alex.
[02:10:17.497 --> 02:10:17.917]  How you doing?
[02:10:18.358 --> 02:10:18.958]  Pretty good, Alex.
[02:10:18.998 --> 02:10:20.059]  What I wanted to talk about...
[02:10:20.683 --> 02:10:32.410]  Was the Hamler comments of the dead people in the World Trade Center as compared to the rest of America who's alive today who doesn't fully understand about what exactly happened on September 11th.
[02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:36.172]  The World Trade Centers were going to be condemned at the highest bestest levels.
[02:10:36.732 --> 02:10:44.016]  The insider stock trading that took place on September 7th and 10th and the way NORAD stood down on September 11th.
[02:10:44.417 --> 02:10:45.777]  No one's catching the big picture.
[02:10:46.698 --> 02:10:50.380]  We're all semi-patriarch waving flags made in China.
[02:10:51.084 --> 02:10:55.105]  And you're the only one that's saying, hey, we've got a plot right here to, you know, happen.
[02:10:57.366 --> 02:11:11.851]  Well, I mean, I'm not the only one that's talking about this, but yeah, I mean, it's easy to not care about the troops and just wave a plastic flag made in China by slaves, a desecrated American flag, and then say patriotism is being a mindless idiot who says the government is God.
[02:11:12.944 --> 02:11:19.432]  But clearly 9-11 is the fulcrum or the center of the wheel on which all the other spokes turn.
[02:11:19.452 --> 02:11:25.961]  They're using it as the excuse over and over again, but all that is mute and a fraud because they're doing nothing about our border.
[02:11:27.441 --> 02:11:29.783]  Well, I heard we have about 500 people down there today.
[02:11:29.843 --> 02:11:31.004]  I'm not confirming that.
[02:11:31.484 --> 02:11:35.087]  But the one lady who interested me was the lady who was on last week.
[02:11:35.247 --> 02:11:36.648]  Her son died in the military.
[02:11:37.148 --> 02:11:41.291]  And a lot of the stuff that she learned on your website, I'm sure she's listening today and tuned in.
[02:11:41.691 --> 02:11:46.034]  But, I mean, the inside of stock trading that took place to me needs to be investigated.
[02:11:46.415 --> 02:11:56.342]  They made $225 million two days before September 11th happened and profited off the people who were killed at the World Trade Center on short bets.
[02:11:58.522 --> 02:12:03.226]  Well, it led directly back to Buzzy Crongard, who's now number three at the CIA.
[02:12:03.286 --> 02:12:10.471]  His company led right back to that, and we heard two days after, oh, we're going to catch you at 9-11, because we've got insider stock trading.
[02:12:11.799 --> 02:12:17.204]  And, boy, this is record insider trading just on American and United.
[02:12:17.544 --> 02:12:22.008]  And then it leads back to Buzzy Crongard, and the story gets dropped like a hand grenade.
[02:12:22.569 --> 02:12:33.018]  And then, on top of that, Buzzy Crongard comes out a month ago in the Times of London and the Associated Press and says, World Net Daily also carried it, and says, leave Bin Laden alone.
[02:12:33.098 --> 02:12:33.839]  Don't arrest him.
[02:12:34.551 --> 02:12:36.612]  And, you know, we need to let him go free.
[02:12:36.732 --> 02:12:41.974]  And then it comes out that our government is paying Pakistan to not arrest him if he's even still alive.
[02:12:42.194 --> 02:12:43.615]  But, I mean, that's the major reports.
[02:12:44.135 --> 02:12:48.177]  And so the guy who's profiting from 9-11 is saying, leave bin Laden alone.
[02:12:48.237 --> 02:12:51.599]  I mean, how much more transparent does this have to get?
[02:12:52.619 --> 02:12:53.380]  I like that, Alex.
[02:12:53.440 --> 02:12:53.900]  That was great.
[02:12:53.980 --> 02:12:58.802]  Alex, anyway, I went to the gun show last weekend, and everybody was talking about sooner than infowards.com, and I'm...
[02:12:59.281 --> 02:13:02.224]  Well, we get more people tuning in every day, and you try to have a good day, sir.
[02:13:02.424 --> 02:13:02.984]  Thank you very much.
[02:13:03.044 --> 02:13:03.505]  Thank you.
[02:13:03.665 --> 02:13:08.569]  And look, I want to actually apologize to, I think it was TJ that I blew up at.
[02:13:10.250 --> 02:13:11.892]  TJ, I mean, I'm really not exaggerating.
[02:13:11.992 --> 02:13:13.293]  I had two hours sleep last night.
[02:13:13.333 --> 02:13:18.097]  I'm trying to finish this film, and I guess if I stay up past a certain point, then I just couldn't go to sleep.
[02:13:18.137 --> 02:13:21.440]  But I am very tired today, and I'm in a very bad mood.
[02:13:21.460 --> 02:13:21.520]  And...
[02:13:23.382 --> 02:13:26.905]  But at the same time, TJ, you know, I'm a man.
[02:13:26.925 --> 02:13:30.027]  I don't like somebody snapping at me going, now you listen here.
[02:13:30.468 --> 02:13:32.429]  So, you know, you should not be rude as well.
[02:13:33.390 --> 02:13:35.231]  You can call back in sometime if you want.
[02:13:35.311 --> 02:13:49.162]  It's just, I think for the last two or three days, I get calls on the hour, every hour, talking about individuals that I'm not informed on connected to really horrible stuff.
[02:13:49.362 --> 02:13:49.863]  And I just...
[02:13:51.227 --> 02:13:53.349]  And the callers will say, is this true?
[02:13:53.429 --> 02:13:54.069]  Is it a rumor?
[02:13:54.530 --> 02:13:56.831]  And that's how people open their mouths.
[02:13:57.292 --> 02:13:59.994]  And I'm like, until I know about it, I'm not going to talk about it.
[02:14:02.536 --> 02:14:04.818]  I mean, this is serious business, folks.
[02:14:05.438 --> 02:14:12.263]  If I talk about something, I've got it triple-checked up one side and down the other, and I still occasionally make a mistake.
[02:14:13.164 --> 02:14:18.588]  But the standard of the law in libel and slander is that you can make a mistake occasionally.
[02:14:19.329 --> 02:14:20.550]  It's that you recklessly...
[02:14:21.221 --> 02:14:23.642]  Disregarded and didn't care and didn't care if it hurt people.
[02:14:24.202 --> 02:14:25.783]  And my duty is not to hurt people.
[02:14:26.283 --> 02:14:28.924]  My mission is not to hurt people who are innocent.
[02:14:31.205 --> 02:14:32.245]  That's not my goal.
[02:14:34.706 --> 02:14:35.626]  That's not what I do.
[02:14:37.007 --> 02:14:39.248]  Now, do the Bushes worship the devil?
[02:14:39.528 --> 02:14:39.848]  Yes.
[02:14:40.088 --> 02:14:41.088]  Do they worship Moloch?
[02:14:41.128 --> 02:14:41.428]  Yes.
[02:14:41.769 --> 02:14:43.109]  Do they lay naked in coffins?
[02:14:43.149 --> 02:14:43.469]  Yes.
[02:14:44.650 --> 02:14:47.211]  Do they go to places where they bust in male prostitutes?
[02:14:47.691 --> 02:14:47.911]  Yes.
[02:14:47.931 --> 02:14:47.991]  Yes.
[02:14:48.846 --> 02:14:54.128]  Have I had Senator John DeCamp, who's never been challenged, and a TV station did challenge him and say his story wasn't true?
[02:14:54.168 --> 02:14:55.708]  He sued him and won 1.4 mil.
[02:14:57.189 --> 02:15:00.470]  I mean, does he say that world leaders are killing kids?
[02:15:00.550 --> 02:15:00.910]  Yes.
[02:15:01.590 --> 02:15:02.331]  Do I believe it?
[02:15:02.471 --> 02:15:03.111]  Absolutely.
[02:15:03.151 --> 02:15:05.572]  It's a rite of passage to bind them to the cult.
[02:15:06.232 --> 02:15:06.892]  Is that true?
[02:15:07.432 --> 02:15:08.153]  Is it going on?
[02:15:08.193 --> 02:15:08.493]  Yes.
[02:15:08.553 --> 02:15:15.575]  But then other names I'm not aware of, I just can't allow them to be mentioned here on air in conjunction with any of this stuff.
[02:15:17.816 --> 02:15:18.256]  It's simple.
[02:15:20.108 --> 02:15:25.430]  And, you know, so maybe you got the brunt of me being irritated because a couple other people brought this up.
[02:15:25.890 --> 02:15:28.890]  And maybe I should, you know, I'm going to try today.
[02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:31.551]  I'm really trying to finish this film by the 27th like I said I would.
[02:15:32.191 --> 02:15:33.412]  I try to be a man of my word.
[02:15:34.412 --> 02:15:35.892]  I'm way behind on the Schwarzenegger stuff.
[02:15:35.912 --> 02:15:37.373]  I've got to do that next after this is done.
[02:15:38.353 --> 02:15:44.935]  But I guess during a break or something I'll try to go research this stuff so I can comment on it.
[02:15:44.975 --> 02:15:46.575]  But I just can't do it all.
[02:15:47.654 --> 02:15:59.257]  And so, if something isn't part of the public domain and somebody just brings it up, I mean, I've had people say, you know, stuff about me, like, oh, he's a Fed, and he this and that, and, you know, before, and it's just totally made up.
[02:15:59.317 --> 02:16:02.077]  And I wish people wouldn't have just grabbed a hold of it and run with it.
[02:16:02.817 --> 02:16:03.998]  You know, stuff like that.
[02:16:04.018 --> 02:16:15.420]  I mean, we need to really, there's so much real stuff we can prove, so much incredible stuff that's just public record that we could never talk about at all.
[02:16:16.229 --> 02:16:19.951]  But so many people I know spend most of their time talking about things you can't prove.
[02:16:22.772 --> 02:16:35.118]  And look, just because the media twists and lies and spins and the patriots and the truth seekers fight it, doesn't mean everything the truth seekers say is true.
[02:16:35.658 --> 02:16:39.840]  I mean, I've got to really bite my tongue a lot, folks, in the interest of solidarity, as they say.
[02:16:40.518 --> 02:16:47.919]  You know, with the magic machines and the magic creams and the this is going to heal you and that's going to heal you.
[02:16:48.299 --> 02:16:49.420]  I don't endorse any of that.
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:50.520]  I don't support any of it.
[02:16:51.020 --> 02:16:52.220]  I don't believe in any of it.
[02:16:54.081 --> 02:16:57.261]  You know, just all this new age garbage, all of it.
[02:16:57.801 --> 02:16:58.861]  I do not believe in it.
[02:16:59.442 --> 02:17:00.822]  And we've been infiltrated by it.
[02:17:00.862 --> 02:17:02.142]  I just have a little more discernment.
[02:17:02.442 --> 02:17:04.523]  And I'm not saying what you were saying earlier isn't true, sir.
[02:17:04.543 --> 02:17:04.843]  The point is...
[02:17:07.734 --> 02:17:08.174]  Show me.
[02:17:08.354 --> 02:17:09.635]  I love their saying up in Missouri.
[02:17:09.655 --> 02:17:10.575]  It's the show me state.
[02:17:10.595 --> 02:17:11.515]  I mean, show it to me.
[02:17:12.436 --> 02:17:13.056]  Show it to me.
[02:17:13.996 --> 02:17:19.698]  You know, if I tell you the government says they're allowed to kill you and your family anytime they want, I'll say U.S.
[02:17:19.738 --> 02:17:28.801]  Code Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B. You know, when I say there's concentration camps, I can name them.
[02:17:29.321 --> 02:17:30.002]  I've been there.
[02:17:30.042 --> 02:17:31.182]  I've shot video of them.
[02:17:31.422 --> 02:17:32.623]  I've got government documents.
[02:17:33.543 --> 02:17:36.524]  Everybody else talking about camps can't ever tell you where they're at.
[02:17:38.723 --> 02:17:39.443]  See, that's the difference.
[02:17:40.464 --> 02:17:42.705]  Why people listen to this show and not the others.
[02:17:46.207 --> 02:17:52.590]  To the farthest corners of the earth, explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:52.910 --> 02:17:55.251]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:55.471 --> 02:17:57.012]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:57.392 --> 02:18:02.475]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:18:02.795 --> 02:18:04.016]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[02:18:04.076 --> 02:18:06.777]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[02:18:18.403 --> 02:18:26.268]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[02:18:26.708 --> 02:18:32.212]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your red book, along with that silver dollar, for only $22.95.

[02:18:44.361 --> 02:18:51.026]  Here's what I see.
[02:18:51.673 --> 02:18:56.874]  One of America's greatest patriots, Patrick Henry, said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:18:57.835 --> 02:19:11.058]  It was Patrick Henry who forced the Bill of Rights to be added to the Constitution, your unalienable or unchangeable right to religious freedom, freedom of the press, freedom of speech, or the right to own a gun.
[02:19:11.839 --> 02:19:17.180]  There are certain movements underway to strip you of these unalienable, unchangeable rights today.
[02:19:17.200 --> 02:19:20.381]  To help you grasp the loss of these freedoms,
[02:19:22.705 --> 02:19:23.966]  1-800-516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736 It's absolutely free.
[02:19:23.986 --> 02:19:26.046]  Operators are standing by to assist you.
[02:19:26.086 --> 02:19:26.807]  Just call right now.
[02:19:46.084 --> 02:19:49.088]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:19:49.448 --> 02:19:58.278]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:19:58.578 --> 02:20:03.244]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:20:03.724 --> 02:20:10.448]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:20:10.849 --> 02:20:22.616]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:23.096 --> 02:20:27.560]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:20:27.720 --> 02:20:30.202]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:30.222 --> 02:20:32.043]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:20:33.324 --> 02:20:34.785]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:20:34.805 --> 02:20:35.866]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:44.864 --> 02:20:45.364]  Hey, psst.
[02:20:45.845 --> 02:20:51.410]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:20:51.650 --> 02:20:52.691]  You use deodorant, right?
[02:20:52.911 --> 02:20:53.792]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:20:53.952 --> 02:20:56.554]  You obviously wear it to cover up embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:20:56.794 --> 02:21:01.678]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:21:01.879 --> 02:21:02.879]  Check out this new product.
[02:21:03.060 --> 02:21:06.002]  It's called No-V-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:21:06.342 --> 02:21:10.326]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-V-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[02:21:10.526 --> 02:21:10.606]  Look.
[02:21:10.626 --> 02:21:11.287]  Still not convinced?
[02:21:11.307 --> 02:21:11.527]  Try it.
[02:21:11.607 --> 02:21:11.908]  Go ahead.
[02:21:12.028 --> 02:21:12.428]  Try Nobio.
[02:21:12.448 --> 02:21:13.329]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:21:26.366 --> 02:21:27.047]  We're good to go.
[02:21:54.308 --> 02:21:59.709]  Alright, I'm going to go to Jason and Tim and Elaine and Walt and Steve, and that'll be it for calls.
[02:21:59.829 --> 02:22:05.710]  I do have some other news I want to cover, but last hour I said in a nutshell I would go over what really happened on 9-11.
[02:22:05.730 --> 02:22:13.652]  Now understand, every point I make is backed up by dozens if not hundreds of pieces of documented public record information.
[02:22:14.212 --> 02:22:21.533]  But instead of just going over the sea of hardcore evidence, why not just boil down what happened?
[02:22:23.487 --> 02:22:30.132]  The globalists needed a crisis to start World War III and to enslave the American people, to use us as an engine of world domination.
[02:22:31.813 --> 02:22:44.743]  And so they took Al-Qaeda operatives, who they had trained and funded, and paid them off to take the blame and play the part of the bad cop in the false scenario.
[02:22:44.803 --> 02:22:49.387]  They then took Arab-speaking, secular, topless bar drunkards
[02:22:50.430 --> 02:22:52.411]  Who were not, you know, even practicing Muslims.
[02:22:53.072 --> 02:23:00.277]  They took them CIA assets, paid for their houses, cars, credit cards.
[02:23:01.458 --> 02:23:03.539]  They were in drills in the months and weeks before 9-11.
[02:23:03.799 --> 02:23:11.084]  A couple weeks before 9-11, actor James Woods, this was on mainstream television, was flying from New York to L.A.
[02:23:11.124 --> 02:23:12.965]  They stopped in Phoenix to pick up more passengers.
[02:23:13.266 --> 02:23:14.747]  He got off, waved his arms.
[02:23:14.767 --> 02:23:16.087]  Never been known for this type of behavior.
[02:23:16.568 --> 02:23:18.309]  And said, these guys are about to hijack.
[02:23:18.329 --> 02:23:19.570]  Turned out it was Muhammad Atta and others.
[02:23:21.092 --> 02:23:23.174]  You know, they're like simulating some type of hijacking.
[02:23:24.375 --> 02:23:26.456]  And it turned out, of course, there were air marshals on board, too.
[02:23:26.496 --> 02:23:27.777]  They were all simulating it with them.
[02:23:28.978 --> 02:23:33.302]  And the FBI walked up to James Woods, this is even Fox News, folks, and said, shut your mouth.
[02:23:33.662 --> 02:23:35.363]  This is part of national security.
[02:23:36.564 --> 02:23:37.305]  Well, see, there you have it.
[02:23:37.725 --> 02:23:38.566]  Week and a half before.
[02:23:40.996 --> 02:23:53.967]  Then on the day of the event, they were having real-world exercises where they had, on real live flights, these simulated Al-Qaeda people on board the planes again, thinking it was part of a drill.
[02:23:54.468 --> 02:24:02.795]  Then on the ground, there was the admitted drill that it was part of, being run by Langley, Virginia, by the CIA, of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[02:24:03.316 --> 02:24:07.099]  Now, I reported this years before it was in the news, but now it's been in USA Today and CNN,
[02:24:08.154 --> 02:24:11.575]  60 Minutes and ABC Nightly News and Associated Press.
[02:24:11.595 --> 02:24:13.556]  I mean, see, folks, we don't just report on this.
[02:24:13.856 --> 02:24:16.837]  We report on it before it's in the news.
[02:24:16.857 --> 02:24:18.637]  I mean, come on.
[02:24:19.198 --> 02:24:20.718]  Seriously, just please wake up.
[02:24:21.398 --> 02:24:23.079]  And we've got the sources.
[02:24:23.819 --> 02:24:26.800]  And so NORAP thinks it's a drill until the first planes start hitting.
[02:24:28.027 --> 02:24:30.468]  Then Cheney's already in the bunker, and he's taken full control.
[02:24:30.848 --> 02:24:34.369]  Three months before 9-11, he had all power signed back over to him and the president.
[02:24:34.690 --> 02:24:35.650]  Rumsfeld signed the order.
[02:24:35.690 --> 02:24:36.410]  We have a copy of it.
[02:24:36.450 --> 02:24:40.152]  No longer could generals at NORAD order the shoot-downs themselves.
[02:24:40.212 --> 02:24:44.913]  It was now given only over to the Secretary of Defense, Cheney, and Bush.
[02:24:45.334 --> 02:24:46.754]  Cheney's in control in the bunker.
[02:24:46.874 --> 02:24:47.394]  That's admitted.
[02:24:47.414 --> 02:24:48.995]  Won't tell us exactly what he was doing.
[02:24:49.035 --> 02:24:51.596]  Some of it's leaked, though, that he did say in testimony.
[02:24:51.616 --> 02:24:52.796]  The order still stands.
[02:24:53.317 --> 02:24:54.317]  That is for the stand-down.
[02:24:56.406 --> 02:24:59.108]  And the nerve gas was released from the aircraft.
[02:24:59.848 --> 02:25:03.070]  All aboard were killed, and they remote-controlled them into the buildings.
[02:25:04.350 --> 02:25:05.331]  And that's what happened.
[02:25:05.911 --> 02:25:07.132]  Okay, it's really that simple.
[02:25:08.192 --> 02:25:11.614]  And again, there's hundreds of pieces of evidence for each point of what I was discussing.
[02:25:13.175 --> 02:25:18.258]  Then you ask, well, how were there the three cell phone calls, which they admit were like one way.
[02:25:19.779 --> 02:25:20.499]  It was just one way.
[02:25:20.559 --> 02:25:21.279]  Honey, are you okay?
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:23.941]  I just want to say they've hijacked us, and now it's bad.
[02:25:25.006 --> 02:25:28.708]  Now, I've talked to some of the FAA people who were in the towers and actually heard what was really happening.
[02:25:29.688 --> 02:25:32.249]  And it was the pilots going, you know, losing pressure.
[02:25:32.970 --> 02:25:34.330]  Can't breathe.
[02:25:35.611 --> 02:25:40.373]  But you got the Al-Qaeda people who are really CIA just sitting there.
[02:25:40.393 --> 02:25:41.414]  I think that's part of their drill.
[02:25:42.094 --> 02:25:42.915]  Gas is released.
[02:25:43.035 --> 02:25:44.275]  They pass out in just 20, 30 seconds.
[02:25:46.656 --> 02:25:48.357]  And the remote control takes control.
[02:25:48.397 --> 02:25:51.219]  I mean, they've got patented stuff that Hollywood's got.
[02:25:51.239 --> 02:25:53.079]  Software now is just a few thousand dollars.
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:26:02.985]  Where I could record your voice for just a few minutes, then put it through this system, and as fast as I can talk, it will simulate your voice real time as I speak.
[02:26:04.005 --> 02:26:06.967]  It'd be like, you know, where I call you up and go, Hello, honey, it's Bob.
[02:26:07.027 --> 02:26:08.268]  I'll be home at nine, all right?
[02:26:08.528 --> 02:26:09.888]  Oh, I forgot the code of the alarm.
[02:26:09.908 --> 02:26:10.869]  Would you mind giving it to me?
[02:26:11.189 --> 02:26:12.810]  And I sound just like your husband.
[02:26:13.755 --> 02:26:24.038]  If I was able to record a few minutes of your husband, if I could shoot a few minutes of you in video now, this is cheap software now, we can make indistinguishable fake video.
[02:26:24.098 --> 02:26:25.819]  It's not just Hollywood stuff from 20 years ago.
[02:26:26.159 --> 02:26:30.501]  You know about Steve McQueen, 25 years dead, he's pitching Mustangs.
[02:26:31.021 --> 02:26:32.901]  John Wayne's pitching fast food.
[02:26:34.062 --> 02:26:38.703]  Forrest Gump, I like to use the example, shaking hands with JFK.
[02:26:38.883 --> 02:26:40.244]  Forrest Gump doesn't exist, folks.
[02:26:40.264 --> 02:26:40.824]  That was fake.
[02:26:41.744 --> 02:26:44.926]  So they produce a few of those, and plus they go, oh, yeah, it was from their own cell phones.
[02:26:44.946 --> 02:26:49.008]  Well, everybody admits your cell phones don't work on planes to begin with, but none of that even matters.
[02:26:50.369 --> 02:26:56.593]  From my inside sources, and I've got a bunch of them, everything they've told me turned out to be true after it came out in the news later.
[02:26:57.053 --> 02:26:58.774]  From all the evidence, the double-checking.
[02:26:58.794 --> 02:27:00.995]  I mean, folks, I knew about 9-11 before it happened.
[02:27:01.035 --> 02:27:03.457]  I got on air, and I said, call the White House.
[02:27:03.817 --> 02:27:08.420]  They're going to blame Bin Laden for attacking the World Trade Center, probably, and have martial law.
[02:27:09.501 --> 02:27:10.322]  Call the White House.
[02:27:10.442 --> 02:27:12.124]  It's Operation Expose Government Terrorists.
[02:27:12.144 --> 02:27:13.466]  Tell them, please don't blow the buildings up.
[02:27:13.866 --> 02:27:15.848]  I mean, it's in my video, Masters of Terror.
[02:27:15.888 --> 02:27:16.769]  I did it on radio.
[02:27:17.330 --> 02:27:21.874]  I've never said call the White House before or since saying that.
[02:27:22.495 --> 02:27:23.076]  That's what happened.
[02:27:23.156 --> 02:27:23.917]  Okay, now you know.
[02:27:24.017 --> 02:27:26.679]  I mean, it's end of the story, end of the discussion.
[02:27:26.719 --> 02:27:27.280]  That's what happened.
[02:27:27.620 --> 02:27:28.421]  You want to know what happened?
[02:27:28.441 --> 02:27:28.982]  That's what happened.
[02:27:30.383 --> 02:27:31.344]  All right, we'll be right back.
[02:27:31.364 --> 02:27:31.705]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.062 --> 02:27:37.023]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.463 --> 02:27:39.063]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.984 --> 02:27:42.805]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.646 --> 02:27:52.269]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregosin, Oregano, Oregomax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[02:27:52.629 --> 02:28:02.894]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated, Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P7-3 oil, and particularly the P7-3 Oregosin, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose.
[02:28:03.534 --> 02:28:05.016]  With a 100% kill.
[02:28:05.316 --> 02:28:10.140]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural Urban Spice products from North American Urban Spice.

[02:28:24.071 --> 02:28:29.536]  The herbal medicine has the exact frequency, the exact chemistry to kill any germ.

[02:28:46.050 --> 02:28:49.034]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:28:49.054 --> 02:28:58.224]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:28:58.544 --> 02:29:03.230]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:29:03.670 --> 02:29:10.392]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:29:10.792 --> 02:29:22.596]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:29:23.056 --> 02:29:27.518]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:29:27.678 --> 02:29:30.018]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:34.760 --> 02:29:35.820]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:29:44.870 --> 02:29:49.697]  This is Jeff Diamond, and we're talking to the creator of Right Size Smoothies, Steve Bostick.
[02:29:49.777 --> 02:29:52.941]  I just got off the phone with a woman who ordered Right Size last week.
[02:29:52.961 --> 02:29:57.608]  Her name was Joni, and she'd already lost 12 pounds in only seven days, and she was so excited.
[02:29:57.628 --> 02:30:01.453]  She said this is the first time that she's tried a weight loss product that actually worked for her.
[02:30:01.633 --> 02:30:06.357]  When you drink a right-sized smoothie, you feel like you're full, and that's what you're looking for, isn't it?
[02:30:06.417 --> 02:30:08.219]  We call it the Hunger Smashing Smoothie.
[02:30:08.239 --> 02:30:11.181]  We've developed a cutting-edge appetite manager called Apamine.
[02:30:11.221 --> 02:30:11.982]  It's in the smoothie.
[02:30:12.062 --> 02:30:13.082]  You drink the smoothie.
[02:30:13.223 --> 02:30:14.444]  It knocks out your appetite.
[02:30:14.464 --> 02:30:18.087]  It helps you burn more calories than you take in safely and without being hungry.
[02:30:18.127 --> 02:30:20.008]  And as you know, that's what leads to weight loss.
[02:30:20.068 --> 02:30:20.989]  It's a great product.
[02:30:21.149 --> 02:30:23.850]  And you're going to let people try this for free for two weeks.
[02:30:23.930 --> 02:30:27.071]  It's the best deal that anybody's ever offered on a weight loss product.
[02:30:27.091 --> 02:30:28.512]  You don't pay anything up front.
[02:30:28.532 --> 02:30:33.534]  You try the product free for two full weeks, see how it works for you, and either you lose the weight or you never pay for it.
[02:30:33.554 --> 02:30:33.974]  Call 1-888-223-2838.
[02:30:33.994 --> 02:30:34.074]  1-888-223-2838.
[02:30:34.094 --> 02:30:35.595]  That's 1-888-223-2838 for right size smoothies.
[02:30:54.565 --> 02:31:03.412]  And when you know what I know, when you know the truth, when you know what we understand, when you face the facts, you'll realize that we're inside the New World Order.
[02:31:04.673 --> 02:31:13.379]  And the next terror attacks, unfortunately, they may have some small pinpricks to kind of get us back in the line, but the more liberty we give up, the bigger the terror attacks get.
[02:31:13.399 --> 02:31:17.883]  The more liberty we give up, the bigger the drug war gets, the more drugs we have on our streets.
[02:31:17.943 --> 02:31:20.265]  The bigger the prisons get, the more crime.
[02:31:21.345 --> 02:31:23.147]  The more funding they get for education...
[02:31:24.201 --> 02:31:25.262]  The dumber the kids get.
[02:31:25.623 --> 02:31:28.766]  Because their own handbooks say it's about dumbing the kids down.
[02:31:28.826 --> 02:31:30.027]  Good job, here's more money.
[02:31:30.227 --> 02:31:32.049]  They tell the public, man, stuff's not going well.
[02:31:32.069 --> 02:31:33.751]  We're going to throw more money at it.
[02:31:34.292 --> 02:31:34.712]  No, no, no.
[02:31:34.752 --> 02:31:36.014]  They're doing their job.
[02:31:38.376 --> 02:31:39.257]  Same thing with the drug war.
[02:31:39.277 --> 02:31:42.520]  Triple the heroin, double the cocaine in this country today that we had 10 years ago.
[02:31:43.221 --> 02:31:45.884]  From 1.3 million in prison to over 7 million in the system.
[02:31:48.636 --> 02:31:50.839]  I had an argument with a state police officer a couple years ago.
[02:31:50.879 --> 02:31:52.120]  I go, there's millions of people in prison.
[02:31:52.141 --> 02:31:52.801]  There's more and more.
[02:31:52.821 --> 02:31:54.083]  He goes, I think that's good.
[02:31:54.443 --> 02:31:56.065]  We got all the criminals in jail.
[02:31:56.826 --> 02:31:58.528]  I said, but you know there's more drugs on the street.
[02:31:58.548 --> 02:31:59.790]  He goes, I have heard those numbers.
[02:32:00.411 --> 02:32:03.514]  I go, why are there more drugs on the street now with more people in prison?
[02:32:04.916 --> 02:32:07.960]  I go, did you know during Prohibition, alcoholism tripled?
[02:32:08.584 --> 02:32:18.854]  Did you know that the small gangs that were in New York and Chicago and Houston and Boston and San Francisco were tiny, but after Prohibition they were huge?
[02:32:21.076 --> 02:32:24.500]  Oh, well, I just think we shouldn't let criminals go free.
[02:32:26.261 --> 02:32:27.863]  They just don't get it.
[02:32:27.903 --> 02:32:29.464]  People aren't thinking three-dimensional.
[02:32:30.445 --> 02:32:31.426]  Or even four-dimensional.
[02:32:32.367 --> 02:32:32.547]  Let's...
[02:32:34.099 --> 02:32:37.602]  It's the drug dealers run the country!
[02:32:38.042 --> 02:32:45.987]  And they literally, the big real WASP-owned and Italian-owned and Jewish-owned crime cartels, because that's all it is.
[02:32:46.468 --> 02:32:49.050]  You know, you criticize some Italian mafia, you're against Italians.
[02:32:49.070 --> 02:32:51.351]  You criticize some Jewish mob, you're against the Jews.
[02:32:51.371 --> 02:32:54.914]  You know, you criticize the German mob or the WASP mob.
[02:32:54.934 --> 02:32:55.654]  It's really the biggest.
[02:32:55.674 --> 02:32:58.096]  It's so powerful, it looks like the authorities...
[02:32:59.139 --> 02:33:00.460]  Oh, you're against white people.
[02:33:00.480 --> 02:33:06.164]  I actually had... I was having an argument a few months ago with somebody, and she goes, to my face, you just don't like white people.
[02:33:06.184 --> 02:33:06.865]  I was going, what?
[02:33:07.865 --> 02:33:08.646]  It's just crazy.
[02:33:08.666 --> 02:33:10.227]  You know, you talk about Mexican mafia.
[02:33:10.487 --> 02:33:11.748]  You don't like the Mexicans.
[02:33:14.870 --> 02:33:16.311]  No, I don't like organized crime.
[02:33:16.571 --> 02:33:23.897]  And if you really look at these groups, these families who we know are the drug dealing families, they are the predominant owners of the private prisons.
[02:33:24.337 --> 02:33:25.858]  So they ship the smack...
[02:33:26.525 --> 02:33:31.230]  And the Coke, and the Ecstasy Inn, and when your kids use it, they put them in prisons they own.
[02:33:31.530 --> 02:33:33.792]  And they make everything now.
[02:33:33.932 --> 02:33:37.836]  And then again, the good old boys sit around going, I'm tired of these criminals.
[02:33:39.457 --> 02:33:42.480]  Have they got hot tubs and colored TVs?
[02:33:42.680 --> 02:33:43.161]  No, they don't.
[02:33:43.561 --> 02:33:44.142]  And they never did.
[02:33:44.162 --> 02:33:45.183]  Okay?
[02:33:45.203 --> 02:33:45.463]  Okay?
[02:33:46.215 --> 02:33:50.918]  They got hot tubs and colored TVs and making work.
[02:33:50.999 --> 02:33:58.784]  Oh, yeah, and you're wondering why you're now making $8 an hour, Bubba, when you were making $20 an hour 15 years ago at the lumber mill.
[02:33:59.765 --> 02:34:05.889]  Because in between the illegal aliens and the lumber mills at the prison, you're competing against people making $0.20 an hour.
[02:34:07.270 --> 02:34:08.551]  Start thinking!
[02:34:09.032 --> 02:34:10.553]  Use your brains!
[02:34:13.712 --> 02:34:19.693]  All right, let's go through a smattering of calls in a hurry here, because I've got news I want to hit before we end this global transmission against tyranny.
[02:34:20.254 --> 02:34:21.834]  Jason and Marilyn, go ahead.
[02:34:21.854 --> 02:34:22.734]  Hello, Alex.
[02:34:23.074 --> 02:34:23.694]  Am I on the air?
[02:34:23.854 --> 02:34:24.495]  Yes, you are.
[02:34:25.075 --> 02:34:28.455]  First of all, I'd like to commend you for apologizing to that man.
[02:34:28.495 --> 02:34:29.456]  We all make mistakes.
[02:34:29.476 --> 02:34:33.837]  I'm a Christian like you, and it takes a man to know when he's wrong and to apologize.
[02:34:33.877 --> 02:34:34.837]  I think that was wonderful.
[02:34:36.497 --> 02:34:39.498]  I was wondering if you've heard of SmartDust.
[02:34:41.136 --> 02:34:41.776]  Oh, of course.
[02:34:41.856 --> 02:34:45.457]  That's the super-microscopic RFID technology revolution.
[02:34:45.817 --> 02:34:49.458]  That's the next wave in smart dust total integration by 2014.
[02:34:49.578 --> 02:34:51.839]  Official government numbers.
[02:34:52.099 --> 02:34:53.839]  Then I won't be telling you anything.
[02:34:53.859 --> 02:34:55.439]  Well, no, tell us about smart dust.
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:35:01.761]  Well, smart dust was created by Dr. Christopher Pister, the professor of...
[02:35:02.856 --> 02:35:06.239]  Electrical engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.
[02:35:06.479 --> 02:35:07.140]  Yes, it was.
[02:35:07.480 --> 02:35:13.125]  And it's microscopic electronic devices that are able to float on the air.
[02:35:13.465 --> 02:35:17.949]  Just type in RFID will be dead in 2014, and you'll get the article about that.
[02:35:18.830 --> 02:35:19.510]  RFID.
[02:35:19.691 --> 02:35:21.472]  RFID is only the next phase.
[02:35:21.512 --> 02:35:22.693]  Then it goes microscopic.
[02:35:24.094 --> 02:35:24.535]  The chips...
[02:35:25.538 --> 02:35:27.160]  And they're going to put it in our food, everything.
[02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:27.520]  Go ahead.
[02:35:27.960 --> 02:35:29.622]  Well, I don't have anything to add.
[02:35:30.002 --> 02:35:32.365]  I see that you know about it more than I do.
[02:35:32.385 --> 02:35:33.345]  Well, it's your show.
[02:35:33.806 --> 02:35:34.607]  Tell us what you think of it.
[02:35:35.608 --> 02:35:38.911]  Well, we're in the end times, and it's obvious.
[02:35:38.991 --> 02:35:39.792]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[02:35:39.972 --> 02:35:47.339]  Jesus will soon be physically here as our leader, and he's going to have to cut the heads off of the bad people that don't take the mark of Jesus.
[02:35:48.288 --> 02:35:48.588]  Sure.
[02:35:48.628 --> 02:35:50.910]  Well, that's what the people who don't know the Bible will think.
[02:35:51.210 --> 02:35:52.311]  That's what they're already saying.
[02:35:52.351 --> 02:35:53.192]  I'm already hearing it.
[02:35:54.733 --> 02:35:59.216]  Because we have to be raptured, so it's impossible if we're still going to be here while it's happening.
[02:36:00.417 --> 02:36:00.858]  Amazing.
[02:36:00.918 --> 02:36:02.019]  And who are you hearing this from?
[02:36:02.039 --> 02:36:04.300]  What did you say the other day about the 700 Club?
[02:36:05.882 --> 02:36:09.144]  Pat Robertson said forced abortion and infanticide is what China has to do.
[02:36:09.184 --> 02:36:16.109]  And I talked about how I got him on the cover of Time Magazine flashing the lion's paw, a satanic hand sign.
[02:36:16.590 --> 02:36:17.310]  That's amazing.
[02:36:17.370 --> 02:36:17.991]  I had no idea.
[02:36:19.453 --> 02:36:26.135]  Listen, about three years ago, when he said China's doing what it has to do, I mean, I had the clip somewhere.
[02:36:26.155 --> 02:36:28.776]  Every couple of years, a computer crashes at the network.
[02:36:28.816 --> 02:36:30.257]  We lose, like, hundreds of audio files.
[02:36:30.277 --> 02:36:33.218]  But I've got video somewhere in literally a room full of tapes.
[02:36:33.698 --> 02:36:36.699]  But on CNN, they said, what do you think about China?
[02:36:36.759 --> 02:36:41.200]  And he goes, well, they're doing what they have to do with, you know, the abortion and the infanticide.
[02:36:41.220 --> 02:36:44.101]  Well, he said, you know, he actually said it.
[02:36:44.441 --> 02:36:46.982]  And then his clarification on the CBN website...
[02:36:48.365 --> 02:36:50.767]  He said, well, they've got a billion quarter people.
[02:36:50.807 --> 02:36:51.508]  They've got to do it.
[02:36:52.048 --> 02:36:55.691]  And a lot of people actually called me mad because I was against him.
[02:36:56.932 --> 02:37:01.396]  And now Jay Sekulow says he helped write the Patriot Act and it's of the Lord and we're evil devils.
[02:37:01.436 --> 02:37:09.823]  I've had national Christian talk show hosts, I'm not going to name them, call me an evil devil for telling lies about our president concerning skull and bones and bohemian growth.
[02:37:11.144 --> 02:37:11.624]  Amazing.
[02:37:12.164 --> 02:37:14.446]  I had no idea that you're really enlightening me.
[02:37:14.486 --> 02:37:15.167]  And I'll tell you just...
[02:37:15.678 --> 02:37:21.004]  As short as two months ago, I thought that President Bush was the best thing since sliced bread.
[02:37:21.024 --> 02:37:23.106]  Until I started, I haven't worked in a couple of months.
[02:37:23.146 --> 02:37:34.178]  I've been listening to your radio program, and I'm thankful that I haven't worked because if I could go back to work and have to trade what you've taught me, I wouldn't do it.
[02:37:34.713 --> 02:37:35.254]  I wouldn't do it.
[02:37:35.594 --> 02:37:36.696]  I think that you're amazing.
[02:37:36.736 --> 02:37:38.098]  I wish that more people were listening.
[02:37:38.318 --> 02:37:39.039]  Well, God bless you.
[02:37:39.059 --> 02:37:41.101]  I'm just an average guy who's been studying this.
[02:37:41.122 --> 02:37:49.332]  You know, I mean, you ever sat beside some guy, you know, at the park who knows every baseball score, knows everything about baseball?
[02:37:49.492 --> 02:37:49.933]  Yes, I have.
[02:37:49.973 --> 02:37:50.814]  And you're just amazed?
[02:37:50.834 --> 02:37:51.956]  Well, it's just because he studied it.
[02:37:52.376 --> 02:37:52.476]  Right.
[02:37:52.996 --> 02:37:55.498]  And so I'm nothing really exceptional.
[02:37:55.518 --> 02:38:03.102]  We can all learn what the New World Order is up to if we keep our discipline to what we can prove and document and compare it to a historical lens.
[02:38:03.802 --> 02:38:04.782]  How are you listening to us?
[02:38:05.543 --> 02:38:06.663]  Just on AM radio.
[02:38:07.224 --> 02:38:08.044]  What station is that?
[02:38:08.804 --> 02:38:09.645]  I really don't even know.
[02:38:09.685 --> 02:38:10.085]  I think it's 810.
[02:38:12.279 --> 02:38:14.541]  Yeah, that's a wonderful station, and God bless them.
[02:38:14.561 --> 02:38:22.287]  That covers, like, I forget, I mean, three or four big cities, and just support them and support their sponsors, and they're just amazing.
[02:38:22.327 --> 02:38:22.687]  Thank you.
[02:38:22.767 --> 02:38:24.088]  I need to ask you one last thing.
[02:38:24.128 --> 02:38:26.490]  If you could help me with this Library of Congress, U.S.
[02:38:26.550 --> 02:38:28.251]  Code 50, Chapter 32, what's the rest of it?
[02:38:28.431 --> 02:38:28.571]  U.S.
[02:38:28.591 --> 02:38:30.012]  Code, Title 50.
[02:38:30.112 --> 02:38:30.253]  U.S.
[02:38:30.293 --> 02:38:30.873]  Code, Title 50.
[02:38:30.913 --> 02:38:32.134]  Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A.
[02:38:32.174 --> 02:38:32.354]  Mm-hmm, 20A.
[02:38:32.394 --> 02:38:33.935]  Paragraph B. Paragraph B.
[02:38:42.185 --> 02:38:44.767]  Paragraph B, subsection 1528.
[02:38:45.067 --> 02:38:45.127]  20A.
[02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:51.473]  20A, paragraph B. Thank you so much, sir.
[02:38:51.713 --> 02:38:51.973]  You bet.
[02:38:51.993 --> 02:38:53.314]  Appreciate it, your call.
[02:38:53.654 --> 02:38:57.758]  And that just says they can use chemical, biological, or radiological weapons on us.
[02:38:58.826 --> 02:39:00.087]  Well, it's doublespeak.
[02:39:00.127 --> 02:39:03.611]  It says that we can't use these lethal weapons on you unless it's for a test.
[02:39:04.132 --> 02:39:05.273]  We can kill you on a test.
[02:39:05.633 --> 02:39:05.933]  Ha ha!
[02:39:06.394 --> 02:39:09.697]  And then we've got them actually killing American citizens hundreds of times.
[02:39:10.158 --> 02:39:16.024]  I mean, they'll come to your town and spray it on you and people will die and they'll have army doctors there to see how you died.
[02:39:16.044 --> 02:39:16.224]  Ha ha ha!
[02:39:18.406 --> 02:39:21.048]  I guess I'm anti-patriotic because I don't want the troops killing us.
[02:39:22.208 --> 02:39:23.809]  Or them going over to Iraq and dying.
[02:39:24.089 --> 02:39:25.850]  Let's talk to Tim in Ohio.
[02:39:25.890 --> 02:39:26.471]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:39:26.711 --> 02:39:27.131]  Howdy, Alex.
[02:39:27.411 --> 02:39:27.691]  Hello.
[02:39:27.871 --> 02:39:29.792]  Or they can have you pay them for it through Big Pharma.
[02:39:32.034 --> 02:39:32.314]  Yep.
[02:39:33.354 --> 02:39:40.338]  Last week when you had Dr. John Breeding on, I tried to call in and tell you about this disturbing cartoon that I saw.
[02:39:40.699 --> 02:39:46.942]  It was a woman in a store talking to another woman, and she had three children in front of her, and they all had the thousand-yard stare, these little kids.
[02:39:47.628 --> 02:39:52.211]  And the caption underneath was, My, your children certainly are well-behaved.
[02:39:52.251 --> 02:39:52.952]  What are their names?
[02:39:53.432 --> 02:39:57.575]  And the mother joyfully responds, Well, this is Prozac, Ritalin, and Zoloft.
[02:39:57.635 --> 02:39:59.276]  And it just made me want to vomit.
[02:40:00.316 --> 02:40:01.397]  I just can't believe that.
[02:40:01.417 --> 02:40:02.958]  People would think that kind of stuff is funny.
[02:40:03.418 --> 02:40:05.540]  Permanently altering their brain chemistry.
[02:40:05.760 --> 02:40:07.121]  All of their internal studies.
[02:40:07.321 --> 02:40:08.282]  They're all public.
[02:40:08.802 --> 02:40:11.163]  And they say, Well, they commit suicide more because they're already depressed.
[02:40:11.203 --> 02:40:11.364]  No.
[02:40:11.664 --> 02:40:16.567]  They take depressed people, put them on Prozac, and their suicide rate at least doubles.
[02:40:17.250 --> 02:40:19.012]  It's not the pool they're drawing from.
[02:40:19.032 --> 02:40:22.295]  And it's so toxic, it rewires the brain.
[02:40:22.315 --> 02:40:30.924]  It is classified in... Psychotropics are classified as a subdivision of hallucinogens.
[02:40:31.845 --> 02:40:33.327]  Now, with the New Freedom Initiative...
[02:40:33.976 --> 02:40:38.518]  You say they're going to force the testing, but what if people can't afford to buy these drugs?
[02:40:38.558 --> 02:40:40.378]  How are they going to enforce the taking of that?
[02:40:40.438 --> 02:40:44.620]  Don't worry, we'll have corporate welfare where the government will pay the drug company for it.
[02:40:45.660 --> 02:40:46.860]  No child left behind.
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:51.042]  No child not playing violent video games and not on Prozac or Ritalin.
[02:40:51.382 --> 02:40:54.963]  I think I told you before, when you get to the anagrams that they use, no child left behind.
[02:40:55.123 --> 02:40:56.444]  No child left free, yeah.
[02:40:56.484 --> 02:40:57.584]  No child behind left.
[02:40:57.904 --> 02:41:01.445]  Because there's going to be nothing left of them by the time they get them up to the drafting.
[02:41:04.218 --> 02:41:20.276]  Interesting thing, too, on the APA's own website, they were bragging that they were thanked by the Bush administration for keeping all of that New Freedom Commission stuff on the hush-hush while it was all being discussed and put into play, and it's even just more disgusting.
[02:41:20.516 --> 02:41:22.118]  Are you familiar with Kevin Donahue?
[02:41:24.068 --> 02:41:24.829]  It rings a bell.
[02:41:25.009 --> 02:41:28.773]  He has an author out now, or a book out now, Natural Cures They Don't Want You to Know About.
[02:41:28.813 --> 02:41:34.198]  He might be a good guest because he was ripping the drug companies for hiding all the natural cures.
[02:41:34.238 --> 02:41:36.420]  He sounds like he'd be right up your alley.
[02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:37.781]  Thanks for the call.
[02:41:38.582 --> 02:41:39.343]  Who's up next here?
[02:41:42.066 --> 02:41:43.047]  Walt in Kansas City.
[02:41:43.087 --> 02:41:43.707]  Go ahead, Walt.
[02:41:44.008 --> 02:41:45.389]  Yeah, God bless you, Alex.
[02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:48.031]  Hey, for all these guys that are non-believers...
[02:41:49.056 --> 02:41:58.164]  I just wanted to say I'm one of the ones that I've been following you for about five years and the only reason is because everything you've got is documented.
[02:41:59.005 --> 02:42:12.516]  You are one of the few in this patriot movement that I can truly trust simply because you're not out here talking about Planet X and space aliens and any of this garbage that you can't prove.
[02:42:13.897 --> 02:42:15.078]  And I mean...
[02:42:16.149 --> 02:42:19.311]  I just don't know what to think about these guys that call in and want to argue.
[02:42:19.391 --> 02:42:22.512]  All I've got to do is go on your website and check it out.
[02:42:23.653 --> 02:42:30.456]  I mean, that's what led me to buy all of your tapes and start getting the information out to everybody.
[02:42:31.016 --> 02:42:33.417]  Because this is the thing.
[02:42:34.338 --> 02:42:37.059]  This guy is of my frame of mind.
[02:42:38.680 --> 02:42:40.301]  You know, and it's all documented.
[02:42:40.661 --> 02:42:41.841]  I mean, God bless you, man.
[02:42:41.881 --> 02:42:44.863]  I mean, you know, yeah.
[02:42:45.475 --> 02:43:03.400]  We've got all this trash on the media, but yet people will gobble that trash up, but yet when they see the truth, and you know what I've found with the few lame brains that won't wake up, is that they're going to get out of their comfort zone if they have to do something.
[02:43:03.861 --> 02:43:08.722]  So they'll get the bag of pretzels and the 12-ouncer and the remote and stay in their comfort zone.
[02:43:11.283 --> 02:43:12.744]  Well, that's exactly what they do.
[02:43:12.924 --> 02:43:17.228]  And the comfort zone, you know, not being in motion when you're under attack is the worst thing you can do.
[02:43:17.308 --> 02:43:24.575]  But, Walt, I met you when I came up to Kansas City with a huge crowd of great folks that came out a few years ago.
[02:43:25.215 --> 02:43:26.917]  And, yeah, people told me, yeah, that's Walt.
[02:43:26.937 --> 02:43:28.438]  He's handed out hundreds of your videos.
[02:43:28.738 --> 02:43:30.500]  How many copies of my films have you made?
[02:43:31.140 --> 02:43:38.907]  Oh, God, it's... Just of your videos alone, I'd say it's well over 5,000 of all of your videos.
[02:43:40.049 --> 02:43:49.136]  And that's why when I was on with that lady from GSFP the other day, and I've received some real nice emails from her, and I've given her some more information.
[02:43:49.156 --> 02:43:55.741]  That was the case of her son dying in Iraq, and you were talking about your sons there now and how they get one meal a day.
[02:43:56.081 --> 02:44:02.907]  Yeah, and what concerned me is, see, I hadn't received an email from him for four weeks, and the other day I got two emails from him.
[02:44:03.507 --> 02:44:09.632]  You know, so... But anyway, the thing is, is... Yeah, I mean...
[02:44:10.686 --> 02:44:15.929]  Yeah, I've handed out over 5,000 of your videos, just your videos alone, simply because.
[02:44:17.109 --> 02:44:19.090]  And then I give everybody your website.
[02:44:19.150 --> 02:44:25.934]  Oh, I've terrorized Kansas City by putting your bumper stickers, The Truth Is Out There.
[02:44:26.998 --> 02:44:29.619]  Infowars.com, the big red and white bumper stickers.
[02:44:29.699 --> 02:44:40.585]  I'll terrorize Kansas City by placing them on signs and on the back of signs and telephone poles and all of these places where people have to stop for red lights, where they look over to the left.
[02:44:41.305 --> 02:44:41.685]  Hmm.
[02:44:42.045 --> 02:44:44.426]  You know, honey, we ought to check that out when we get home.
[02:44:45.107 --> 02:44:48.348]  Well, what you're doing is a great thing.
[02:44:48.408 --> 02:44:48.848]  It's funny.
[02:44:48.949 --> 02:44:51.950]  I get photos sent to me from New Zealand of a giant...
[02:44:52.634 --> 02:44:59.375]  Derelict building they're going to demolish with InfoWars painted just huge on it, you know, 50 feet long.
[02:44:59.435 --> 02:45:01.116]  And how dare you do this?
[02:45:01.796 --> 02:45:11.818]  Well, I don't live in New Zealand or InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com on these big road signs.
[02:45:12.138 --> 02:45:13.838]  And I'm saying don't do that, folks.
[02:45:13.878 --> 02:45:16.899]  But, yeah, definitely the bumper stickers.
[02:45:16.919 --> 02:45:17.899]  You're doing a great job, Walt.
[02:45:17.919 --> 02:45:19.660]  Well, you know, I'll tell you something else, too.
[02:45:19.700 --> 02:45:21.000]  When I set my trash out...
[02:45:21.650 --> 02:45:29.393]  My big receptacle, the wheel out there to the curb, has the same bumper stickers on all four corners.
[02:45:29.473 --> 02:45:38.896]  So no matter which way it turns, you know, I mean, anybody driving by, the trash man who picks the stuff up, anything, you know, everybody can see it.
[02:45:39.797 --> 02:45:43.718]  I mean, you know, what can I say?
[02:45:43.758 --> 02:45:44.739]  That's what we got to do.
[02:45:44.919 --> 02:45:48.580]  Everybody needs to get on the ball here and work together.
[02:45:49.398 --> 02:45:50.999]  Well, JFK's big brother, who...
[02:46:13.246 --> 02:46:18.831]  You know, was the junior of his father, who was going to be the guy who was going to run for president.
[02:46:19.151 --> 02:46:25.517]  He died, what, in 1944, flying an airplane remote-controlling two bombers beneath him.
[02:46:26.778 --> 02:46:28.199]  We had our own flying bombs.
[02:46:28.299 --> 02:46:29.500]  It's very old technology.
[02:46:29.741 --> 02:46:32.543]  Walt, good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:46:32.583 --> 02:46:33.124]  Always good.
[02:46:33.184 --> 02:46:33.564]  Take care.
[02:46:34.525 --> 02:46:35.446]  Steve in Michigan.
[02:46:35.486 --> 02:46:36.026]  Last caller.
[02:46:36.046 --> 02:46:36.567]  Go ahead, Steve.
[02:46:37.227 --> 02:46:39.529]  It's Stu, but that's okay.
[02:46:39.890 --> 02:46:40.130]  Thanks.
[02:46:41.725 --> 02:46:49.389]  Sunday, when I was watching the Daytona 500, Coca-Cola came on with a new commercial.
[02:46:50.349 --> 02:47:05.476]  It was animated, and it had a subliminal message with a character, one of the race car drivers, walking up to a Coke machine and using a hand scan
[02:47:06.354 --> 02:47:14.376]  Instead of putting your money in the machine, he used a hand scan to get the coke out of the machine.
[02:47:15.256 --> 02:47:23.278]  And then the next scene was an eye scan, and the scene broke into him sitting in the car.
[02:47:24.338 --> 02:47:27.819]  So he's a rock star race car champion because he scans.
[02:47:30.240 --> 02:47:31.540]  Ah, that or...
[02:47:32.543 --> 02:47:46.715]  That or the fact that, you know, I took it as a subliminal message that it's okay to be using your hand scan instead of using current.
[02:47:46.755 --> 02:47:49.937]  Yeah, no, I mean, they take the role model, the champion.
[02:47:50.518 --> 02:47:51.158]  Right, exactly.
[02:47:51.178 --> 02:47:55.202]  The champion isn't a scientist or an inventor or a firefighter who saves people.
[02:47:55.282 --> 02:47:58.164]  It's some dork who drives a race car around a track.
[02:47:59.105 --> 02:48:01.447]  Let me just finish saying this.
[02:48:02.324 --> 02:48:03.325]  They're in a Super Bowl.
[02:48:03.805 --> 02:48:04.906]  And I have this in Road to Tyranny.
[02:48:04.946 --> 02:48:06.187]  They showed them retina scanning.
[02:48:07.788 --> 02:48:09.649]  And this is how they're going to sell this.
[02:48:09.669 --> 02:48:13.212]  Remember the IBM commercial where the cool guy is sticking all the food in his jacket?
[02:48:14.112 --> 02:48:19.476]  And you think he's stealing, and then it scans him, and the security guard goes, thank you, sir, and gives him a receipt?
[02:48:20.116 --> 02:48:21.857]  Yeah, they're mass conditioning us, sir.
[02:48:22.098 --> 02:48:22.358]  Sure.
[02:48:22.778 --> 02:48:23.098]  Yeah.
[02:48:25.040 --> 02:48:25.720]  Absolutely.
[02:48:25.840 --> 02:48:27.721]  Well, the answer is don't drink Coca-Cola.
[02:48:28.922 --> 02:48:29.703]  You got that.
[02:48:30.245 --> 02:48:33.269]  Hey, thank you for being a messenger of the truth.
[02:48:33.449 --> 02:48:34.090]  Thank you, sir.
[02:48:34.590 --> 02:48:36.532]  And type stuff like that and send it to me.
[02:48:37.574 --> 02:48:39.576]  I mean, yeah, folks, they think you're mindless idiots.
[02:48:39.816 --> 02:48:41.038]  They think they can brainwash you.
[02:48:41.638 --> 02:48:42.239]  Tell them no.
[02:48:42.479 --> 02:48:43.060]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.876 --> 02:48:50.219]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.419 --> 02:48:54.842]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.982 --> 02:48:59.345]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.385 --> 02:49:00.746]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.527 --> 02:49:06.750]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.810 --> 02:49:13.754]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.874 --> 02:49:15.936]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.136 --> 02:49:26.563]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[02:51:48.315 --> 02:51:54.336]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:54.936 --> 02:51:57.917]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:07.120 --> 02:52:10.181]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:52:11.121 --> 02:52:12.261]  Just some of the news here.
[02:52:12.401 --> 02:52:12.701]  U.S.
[02:52:12.721 --> 02:52:14.962]  drug czar likens fighting drugs...
[02:52:15.990 --> 02:52:17.131]  For the war on terror.
[02:52:17.412 --> 02:52:19.334]  And again, now they're saying you'll be a terrorist.
[02:52:19.354 --> 02:52:21.516]  They're charging people with terrorism for having marijuana.
[02:52:22.237 --> 02:52:27.143]  The United States should employ some of the techniques it's using to fight international terrorism, like torture.
[02:52:27.163 --> 02:52:29.405]  And it's war on drugs.
[02:52:29.506 --> 02:52:29.726]  U.S.
[02:52:29.766 --> 02:52:33.130]  drug czar Jonathan Walters said on Tuesday...
[02:52:34.585 --> 02:52:38.528]  Interview today before President Bush was due to release his National Drug Control Strategy.
[02:52:38.828 --> 02:52:42.170]  This from one of the biggest drug dealing families in the country.
[02:52:42.490 --> 02:52:48.434]  Maybe the brutal experiences we've had with terror helps to make this more concrete and understandable.
[02:52:48.634 --> 02:52:52.456]  Yes, more SWAT teams, more prisons owned by the drug dealers.
[02:52:53.097 --> 02:52:55.238]  Yes, you're going to be our slaves.
[02:52:56.619 --> 02:52:58.080]  This out of the Associated Press.
[02:52:58.120 --> 02:53:02.823]  Again, report Mexican drug lords and Mexican special forces troops killing people in Dallas.
[02:53:03.962 --> 02:53:05.183]  Well, I don't listen to the Syrian minister.
[02:53:05.203 --> 02:53:06.483]  I listen to Dick Cheney and the P9 documents.
[02:53:06.563 --> 02:53:07.243]  That's exactly what they say.
[02:53:33.365 --> 02:53:38.369]  Pakistani army, our ally, we help give nukes to shoot at intruding U.S.
[02:53:38.409 --> 02:53:38.750]  forces.
[02:53:38.770 --> 02:53:41.212]  The Pakistani government has ordered the army to shoot at U.S.
[02:53:41.252 --> 02:53:45.976]  forces if they intrude into the country from neighboring Afghanistan without authorization.
[02:53:48.178 --> 02:53:50.120]  But because they're a real threat, they'll be worshipped.
[02:53:51.681 --> 02:53:53.803]  The Pope likens abortion to the Holocaust.
[02:53:53.823 --> 02:53:55.264]  Well, that's something good he could say.
[02:53:55.284 --> 02:53:58.607]  He's usually saying world government's good, but this is a good statement.
[02:53:58.627 --> 02:53:59.428]  It is like that.
[02:54:00.069 --> 02:54:00.750]  It's controversial?
[02:54:00.770 --> 02:54:00.890]  I mean...
[02:54:14.173 --> 02:54:15.333]  It's just, it's true.
[02:54:15.353 --> 02:54:17.374]  I mean, what are you going to say?
[02:54:17.394 --> 02:54:19.814]  I mean, I'm not Catholic, but I support the Pope in this.
[02:54:20.614 --> 02:54:23.295]  Interpol sounds bioterror alarm.
[02:54:23.755 --> 02:54:27.956]  The world is ill-prepared with the looming threat of a biological terror attack.
[02:54:27.976 --> 02:54:36.938]  The head of Interpol has said, Roland Noble told BBC the danger of Al-Qaeda, Al-Qaeda attack, had not diminished since the 9-11 strikes on the U.S.
[02:54:36.998 --> 02:54:42.919]  And he says we need a global police body or a global government to deal with it.
[02:54:43.239 --> 02:54:43.679]  Very nice.
[02:54:44.913 --> 02:54:46.734]  And U.S.
[02:54:46.794 --> 02:55:00.144]  terror suspects was tortured by Saudis, London Independent, an American citizen allegedly tortured in Saudi Arabia jail, was charged yesterday with inspiring to assassinate President George Bush and of being linked to Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda terrorist network.
[02:55:01.385 --> 02:55:04.347]  And they tortured him and are now going to trial the 23-year-old.
[02:55:05.327 --> 02:55:11.472]  Iranian jails editor for 15 years for insulting leaders.
[02:55:12.668 --> 02:55:17.991]  So I ran jails and newsletters for 14 years for insulting one of their leaders.
[02:55:18.611 --> 02:55:28.857]  And we have kind of the light version of that, where a child writes a letter to the troops saying they don't agree with the war, and they threaten to suspend them if they don't apologize.
[02:55:30.138 --> 02:55:38.302]  I thought that that was their prerogative, to be able to do that, to be able to have their own comments heard.
[02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:41.362]  To be able to say and think what they want.
[02:55:41.783 --> 02:55:44.164]  Students' lawsuit over t-shirts gains ground.
[02:55:44.185 --> 02:55:57.556]  Chicago Sun-Times, the kids were kicked out of school and then got in trouble because they were the honor roll and they were wearing shirts that said, and you can't have a shirt saying you're good.
[02:55:58.336 --> 02:56:00.078]  It's all part of the new mind control.
[02:56:00.098 --> 02:56:04.982]  And I got a big article here that we don't have time to get to, unfortunately.
[02:56:06.336 --> 02:56:12.300]  Where it talks about how the government is admittedly running around taking everybody's private property.
[02:56:12.840 --> 02:56:15.282]  Your home is your castle until the city says it wants it.
[02:56:16.062 --> 02:56:24.787]  And the AP article carried in USA Today admits that it isn't even for... It's about money making.
[02:56:24.827 --> 02:56:27.149]  Cities just take your property now with no just compensation.
[02:56:27.629 --> 02:56:28.890]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:28.950 --> 02:56:29.931]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:30.011 --> 02:56:30.931]  God bless you all.
[02:56:31.051 --> 02:56:32.172]  Death to the New World Order.
