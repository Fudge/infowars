[00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:06.349]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.090]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.910]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:11.371]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:12.992]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.672 --> 00:00:17.353]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.853 --> 00:00:21.995]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.057 --> 00:00:31.579]  Well, right on time for Bush's speech today, they found wild birds.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:43.244]  Up in Canada, with the particular bird flu, they've been worried about jumping over into humans, from human to human transmission.
[00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:45.404]  That has not happened yet.
[00:00:47.345 --> 00:01:01.610]  But now, even major publications like CNN, Fortune Magazine, the Associated Press, are reporting on what we reported on a month ago, Rumsfeld's growing stake in Tamiflu.
[00:01:03.238 --> 00:01:23.568]  Not to mention, at least three prominent Bilderberg Group members, and they're going to make millions and millions and billions of dollars off of this, just like they did off of drugs for SARS, and the President gets to grandstand about martial law and condition us further, and then one day I'm sure they will launch some deadly bio-attack on us, and that'll be the end of it.
[00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.892]  It'll be just more New World Order activities for all of us, so we'll get into that after the break.
[00:01:30.272 --> 00:01:32.633]  And this happened a few weeks ago, and I haven't covered it,
[00:01:34.335 --> 00:01:47.204]  I haven't read the text of what he said, but I haven't listened to the audio of it, and I've got some comments on this Dr. Camu Cambon, who says they need to kill every white person on the face of the earth.
[00:01:47.244 --> 00:01:55.429]  He ought to get together with Matchup and try to, I guess, implement the plan of San Diego, because they believe the same thing.
[00:01:56.169 --> 00:02:02.734]  And I wonder if the Texas Civil Rights Commission or any of these other groups will
[00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:08.875]  Criticize me for saying it's wrong to say we should kill all the white people.
[00:02:08.935 --> 00:02:13.559]  I'm not for killing the black people or killing the Jews.
[00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:23.307]  I know I'm evil because it upsets me that it's a growing movement that if you just kill all the white people, your problems will all be solved.
[00:02:23.347 --> 00:02:24.008]  Well, don't worry.
[00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.972]  Whites are about 8% of the world population or really less than that.
[00:02:30.638 --> 00:02:37.820]  Because you've got hundreds of millions of Latin Americans who call themselves, in questionnaires, white in the global census, who really aren't.
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.801]  So you're looking at about maybe 6%, 5%.
[00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:48.803]  And at the rate of intermarrying, don't worry, but don't worry, you can still hunt down anybody that has white blood.
[00:02:49.903 --> 00:02:50.604]  That can happen.
[00:02:51.944 --> 00:02:54.925]  So don't worry, don't worry, it can continue on from there.
[00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:59.106]  But the genocide against white people is ongoing, and so
[00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:07.391]  And it's being conducted by white people, so you can really, I mean, it's being conducted against black people, and everybody else for that matter.
[00:03:08.612 --> 00:03:11.474]  And that's where this doctor gets it all wrong.
[00:03:12.795 --> 00:03:24.843]  And so it's an interesting little five minute clip, we'll play it later in the show after we get into the bird flu and the latest indictment information, the latest on Bush's court nominee for the Supremes, and yes,
[00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:28.598]  No guests today, I just want to take your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:33.482]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:33.502 --> 00:03:38.024]  Any issue, any news item, anything you'd like to talk about, 1-800-259-9231, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[00:03:38.064 --> 00:03:41.285]  And never forget the websites, they're InfoWars.com, InfoWars.net, PrisonPlanet.tv, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:05.244]  And all four of the sites have a lot of the same news, a lot of the same information, but every day there's stuff on each of the sites that isn't on the other sites.
[00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:19.874]  So always important to visit the sites on a daily basis and we thank all of you that have been helping get the word out about the website so that we're able to reach tens of millions of people a month just through the web alone, not to mention the radio show.
[00:04:19.914 --> 00:04:26.578]  It's very heartening and it certainly makes me jump out of bed every morning and put a skip in my step
[00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:32.362]  Knowing that we're reaching so many people and that we are effective because of you.
[00:04:33.364 --> 00:04:35.629]  An article Paul Watson wrote yesterday was amazing.
[00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.412]  It costs nothing to be a patriot.
[00:04:40.452 --> 00:04:41.192]  You should go read that.
[00:04:41.693 --> 00:04:43.514]  And his brother, Steve Watson, wrote one about this.
[00:04:43.754 --> 00:04:45.736]  Still being rammed through.
[00:04:45.756 --> 00:04:48.237]  The fight is still ongoing.
[00:04:48.277 --> 00:04:52.220]  We've had victories, but that only means the enemy is doubling their efforts.
[00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.661]  We have to redouble ours.
[00:04:54.201 --> 00:04:58.724]  The transmission shall continue in great detail on the other side.
[00:05:08.991 --> 00:05:13.372]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:13.412 --> 00:05:16.233]  The New World Order in America.
[00:05:16.253 --> 00:05:26.776]  From cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide, we rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft... You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:27.096 --> 00:05:36.278]  Homeland Security, executive abortions, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.598 --> 00:05:41.981]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you!

[00:05:54.221 --> 00:05:57.703]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Element.
[00:05:57.963 --> 00:06:01.464]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[00:06:05.726 --> 00:06:11.889]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:20.193]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:25.958]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.

[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.161]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[00:06:57.361 --> 00:07:01.444]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[00:07:01.564 --> 00:07:08.888]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste bill, is something we all face every day.
[00:07:09.168 --> 00:07:11.070]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:18.154]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long life battery lasts for 10 years.
[00:07:18.494 --> 00:07:21.356]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy tested.

[00:07:50.054 --> 00:07:50.514]  Nucleart.

[00:07:54.296 --> 00:07:59.360]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.981]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.912 --> 00:08:15.853]  Well, it's the first day, my friends, of November 2005.
[00:08:16.473 --> 00:08:18.874]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:19.494 --> 00:08:23.034]  And I really appreciate you joining us today.
[00:08:23.054 --> 00:08:27.595]  I have a little bit more I want to say about Sam Haines showin' Halloween.
[00:08:28.856 --> 00:08:34.737]  Because I got a few emails and one phone call on air yesterday going, oh, come on, it's all just a bunch of fun.
[00:08:36.116 --> 00:08:39.637]  And the point is, is that it is just a bunch of fun for most people.
[00:08:40.117 --> 00:08:50.258]  But there's a covert agenda here working that is now becoming more and more public to recruit in our schools and colleges and to push an agenda.
[00:08:50.498 --> 00:08:54.199]  And that agenda is coming out of Washington, it's coming out of New York.
[00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:57.820]  Our leaders are into black magic.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.560]  And you've got, most of the prominent leaders really are.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.161]  Presidential level type individuals, prime ministers, chancellors.
[00:09:05.763 --> 00:09:07.184]  In their own autobiographies.
[00:09:08.004 --> 00:09:11.125]  And this mindset, this idea, governs them.
[00:09:11.986 --> 00:09:13.286]  This magical thinking.
[00:09:14.146 --> 00:09:17.808]  I mean, no matter whether you believe in God or not, these people are fruitcakes.
[00:09:17.828 --> 00:09:18.628]  They're off their rocker.
[00:09:19.549 --> 00:09:30.193]  And there's this big crowd of New Age-y, nothing New Age about it, pagans, neo-pagans, who get real mad if you criticize Bush or anybody else for being into the occult.
[00:09:31.358 --> 00:09:51.879]  And I've got mainstream news articles here today where they were in cemeteries hugging the gravestones and trying to talk to the dead and it's sponsored by major cities and oh now the biggest growing religious group is the pagans and the Wiccans and Halloween's the start of their new year and
[00:09:53.065 --> 00:09:58.307]  Oh, look, the children are cutting themselves and dripping blood all over the ground, but it's nice.
[00:09:58.547 --> 00:10:00.787]  It's not kids are mutilating themselves at school.
[00:10:00.847 --> 00:10:02.508]  It's part of their sacrament.
[00:10:02.568 --> 00:10:02.968]  Let them.
[00:10:03.248 --> 00:10:04.088]  Don't be hateful.
[00:10:04.128 --> 00:10:05.729]  Let them slice themselves.
[00:10:06.449 --> 00:10:12.330]  And occasionally, every week or so, they grab some person and murder them and drink their blood, and it's in the back of the newspaper.
[00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:21.113]  I mean, to make 15-year-olds go out on a weekly basis and drink people's blood, I mean... Folks, throughout history, that's what these occult groups do.
[00:10:23.314 --> 00:10:27.897]  And the neo-pagans can try to deny that, but that's how you serve the horned god.
[00:10:28.918 --> 00:10:35.202]  And when they recruit you into these organizations, they don't tell you that, but by the time you really get into it, you find out.
[00:10:36.683 --> 00:10:39.945]  And so we need to be honest about all of this.
[00:10:40.005 --> 00:10:42.286]  We need to understand all of this.
[00:10:42.386 --> 00:10:46.669]  They would sacrifice people by cutting their hearts out, burning them to death on a pyre,
[00:10:47.498 --> 00:10:57.026]  And then that's why a lot of the quote persecution of witches was really just political persecution against innocent individuals and it was actually witches and warlocks conducting the burnings.
[00:10:57.806 --> 00:11:06.053]  And I was shocked to hear that pastor Ronald Dart on WAI talk about that Sunday night.
[00:11:06.093 --> 00:11:10.936]  I was listening to his show and I know Tex Mars is aware of that but this is something most people don't know.
[00:11:11.277 --> 00:11:12.658]  It's actually the occultist
[00:11:13.414 --> 00:11:18.557]  At Salem and other places that are engaging in human sacrifice publicly.
[00:11:18.877 --> 00:11:25.301]  That's also part of their religion is they get more power off of something that was done in plain view and they fool people while they do it.
[00:11:26.001 --> 00:11:29.623]  They also like to speak something before they do it and give you a warning before they do it.
[00:11:29.643 --> 00:11:32.225]  It's like counting coo of the Native Americans.
[00:11:32.505 --> 00:11:35.787]  They believe they get more hoojoo out of it, more power.
[00:11:37.341 --> 00:11:38.662]  But, I'm now digressing.
[00:11:38.682 --> 00:11:39.943]  That's coming up later.
[00:11:40.043 --> 00:11:41.084]  Probably in the next hour.
[00:11:41.264 --> 00:11:43.266]  I've got a whole stack of news here on it.
[00:11:44.207 --> 00:11:51.252]  All mainstream, where they're cutting themselves and hugging tombstones and dancing around and doing all of this.
[00:11:51.673 --> 00:11:53.414]  We're supposed to just shut up and take it.
[00:11:53.734 --> 00:11:56.657]  And let them recruit in the schools and push this on us.
[00:11:57.137 --> 00:11:57.417]  No!
[00:11:58.638 --> 00:12:03.202]  You don't want Christianity pushed on you in the schools, but you're going to push your religion, aren't you?
[00:12:03.803 --> 00:12:04.183]  Aren't you?
[00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:06.230]  That it needs to stop.
[00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:06.591]  And you know what?
[00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:07.571]  I don't care if you're offended.
[00:12:08.992 --> 00:12:11.813]  I get these emails from these neo-pagans going, it's not true.
[00:12:12.253 --> 00:12:14.854]  My discipline doesn't have any human sacrifice in its history.
[00:12:15.214 --> 00:12:15.614]  Bull!
[00:12:16.355 --> 00:12:17.015]  Baloney!
[00:12:18.455 --> 00:12:19.076]  Baloney!
[00:12:19.516 --> 00:12:22.057]  Just because you're ignorant doesn't mean it isn't true, okay?
[00:12:23.617 --> 00:12:27.659]  Former soldier wins landmark case over Gulf War syndrome.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.001]  And our national statistics, within five years after the Gulf War,
[00:12:33.252 --> 00:12:42.039]  Over a tripling, almost a quadrupling of birth defects in troops, military men and women that served in Iraq and in Kuwait.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.040]  A tripling!
[00:12:44.921 --> 00:12:46.662]  A tripling, and it was a cocktail of things.
[00:12:46.722 --> 00:12:53.387]  DU, the vaccines, a whole cocktail of things, but you cannot debate.
[00:12:54.268 --> 00:12:56.189]  You cannot debate.
[00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:02.494]  You understand, it is admitted, you know, time-life books, federal documents,
[00:13:03.283 --> 00:13:05.305]  New York Daily News, they've done the test.
[00:13:05.445 --> 00:13:11.890]  It is not debated there's a tripling, a tripling, over a tripling of birth defects.
[00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:18.756]  Well, now we've been in Iraq two and a half years and we're getting preliminary numbers on what's happened this time and it's worse.
[00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:28.184]  And yeah, they used, again that number, at least tripled the DU, and they gave them even more experimental vaccines, smallpox and anthrax,
[00:13:29.682 --> 00:13:33.503]  And so we're seeing an even greater level than we saw before.
[00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:36.884]  And see, you can't debate the facts, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:37.464 --> 00:13:47.006]  I know there are people out there that supporting the troops means not caring if they don't get health care, not caring about them, just sticking a sticker on your car and feeling good and worshipping the corrupt government.
[00:13:48.826 --> 00:13:56.828]  But this is out of England, who's been trying to deny it now, but about two years ago the government said, okay, it is true, our troops are sick,
[00:13:58.294 --> 00:14:05.877]  And, uh, so, so, this is a real biological slash radiological chemical holocaust that's going on.
[00:14:06.937 --> 00:14:08.597]  Hundreds of thousands of our troops are sick.
[00:14:09.038 --> 00:14:12.359]  Over 50,000 have conservatively died from the illness.
[00:14:12.919 --> 00:14:16.900]  Former soldier wins landmark case over Gulf War Syndrome, London Independent.
[00:14:18.281 --> 00:14:25.243]  A former guardsman suffering from Gulf War Syndrome has won a landmark legal case against the Ministry of Defense.
[00:14:26.391 --> 00:14:35.579]  Daniel Martin, 35, who has suffered from chronic fatigue syndrome, memory loss, and impaired concentration since 1991 conflict, probably from nerve gas.
[00:14:36.339 --> 00:14:39.762]  That's one of the big contributors was blowing up those nerve gas depots.
[00:14:40.543 --> 00:14:41.463]  And there's video of it.
[00:14:42.004 --> 00:14:42.284]  U.S.
[00:14:42.364 --> 00:14:49.530]  Mark, we had to get rid of the evidence, was received a disability award under the umbrella arm of Gulf War Syndrome.
[00:14:51.545 --> 00:14:56.787]  and uh... they now admit that uh... the government's now saying oh fifteen hundred of our soldiers have had this happen.
[00:14:58.247 --> 00:15:07.750]  Up at UT Dallas four years ago they did autopsies of uh... two dozen dead U.S.
[00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:08.890]  soldiers.
[00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:15.472]  The families asked that they uh... those were just soldiers dying at the time who'd been involved in exposing this.
[00:15:16.012 --> 00:15:19.293]  They did the autopsies and they found that they all had
[00:15:20.365 --> 00:15:47.818]  high levels of sarin and VX chemicals in their nerve stems in the spinal cord in the brain stem where it tends to concentrate and so they had those chemicals there and basically the chemicals just sit there and just over a few years even if you get a light dosage of it eats through until you suddenly start
[00:15:48.795 --> 00:16:01.182]  Losing bowel control, you lose weight, you start shaking, then you stop being able to breathe and you die with your family around you at the VA hospital with foreign doctors who can't even speak English swarming around you.
[00:16:02.322 --> 00:16:07.545]  And if you complain, now the VA hospitals keep a couple big thugs in there, if you complain or smart off,
[00:16:08.662 --> 00:16:10.543]  They'll just drag you out and charge you.
[00:16:10.583 --> 00:16:12.164]  I see that in the press every few weeks.
[00:16:12.524 --> 00:16:15.606]  Where they beat up veterans' wives and drag them out by their hair.
[00:16:16.026 --> 00:16:17.047]  It's all real fun.
[00:16:17.747 --> 00:16:20.009]  But that was just one case where they studied them.
[00:16:20.609 --> 00:16:27.533]  And then the New York Daily News paid to have 15 soldiers who were real sick.
[00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:28.754]  This was two years ago.
[00:16:29.194 --> 00:16:33.356]  They have MRIs on their lungs and swabs done and biopsies.
[00:16:34.137 --> 00:16:35.778]  And they found just total
[00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.311]  Total saturation of depleted uranium in their lungs.
[00:16:39.391 --> 00:16:43.773]  So, it's a cocktail of poison.
[00:16:44.934 --> 00:16:46.275]  And it doesn't matter to the government.
[00:16:46.795 --> 00:16:55.639]  If it's kind of in the back of the paper, an occasional Timeline article, or an occasional Dallas Morning News article, or an occasional article in the New York Daily News,
[00:16:56.596 --> 00:16:57.157]  It doesn't matter.
[00:16:57.177 --> 00:16:58.638]  Just stick a sticker on your car.
[00:16:58.718 --> 00:16:59.278]  Feel good.
[00:16:59.398 --> 00:17:00.319]  Swagger around.
[00:17:00.439 --> 00:17:01.280]  Stumble around.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:04.583]  All the government doubles in size and all our liberties are flushed down the toilet.
[00:17:04.603 --> 00:17:06.264]  Just stumble around worshipping Bush.
[00:17:06.824 --> 00:17:08.766]  When I say stumble around, these people are just so stupid.
[00:17:08.786 --> 00:17:10.387]  They literally stumble around.
[00:17:10.928 --> 00:17:12.109]  I've argued with Bush supporters.
[00:17:12.129 --> 00:17:14.951]  They're like a stumbling, fumbling, fumbling idiot.
[00:17:16.212 --> 00:17:18.834]  And they'll even call you one of them right-wing Republicans.
[00:17:18.954 --> 00:17:19.935]  Or they'll call me a liberal.
[00:17:19.995 --> 00:17:23.438]  Either way, you're one of them extreme right-wingers, aren't you?
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:26.381]  Party don't need you.
[00:17:27.061 --> 00:17:28.162]  Or I'm called a communist.
[00:17:29.683 --> 00:17:32.084]  But you sit there and try to talk to them, and they just don't listen.
[00:17:32.584 --> 00:17:39.128]  So they'll just feel good, and if their son or daughter dies of this, they'll still... Then they might email me and go, You were right!
[00:17:39.248 --> 00:17:39.748]  Help me!
[00:17:39.828 --> 00:17:41.569]  Please, you're not responding to my emails!
[00:17:41.769 --> 00:17:44.190]  Because there's hundreds a day of people with their kids dying of this stuff.
[00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.551]  I mean, how do I respond to all of them?
[00:17:45.571 --> 00:17:46.772]  I got two in the stack right here.
[00:17:47.312 --> 00:17:48.793]  How am I supposed to even respond to you?
[00:17:51.557 --> 00:17:52.558]  I used to hate you.
[00:17:52.638 --> 00:17:53.278]  I didn't believe it.
[00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:54.459]  My son just came back.
[00:17:54.499 --> 00:17:55.380]  He was all healthy.
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.782]  Now he's paralyzed.
[00:17:58.162 --> 00:17:59.843]  They don't know what it is.
[00:18:00.664 --> 00:18:01.184]  Help me!
[00:18:01.404 --> 00:18:01.965]  Help me!
[00:18:02.325 --> 00:18:02.905]  Help me!
[00:18:03.225 --> 00:18:03.746]  Help me!
[00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:04.807]  Help me!
[00:18:04.827 --> 00:18:06.868]  My boy!
[00:18:07.028 --> 00:18:07.789]  He's dying!
[00:18:09.010 --> 00:18:11.872]  What do I do?
[00:18:12.612 --> 00:18:14.353]  I've even taken time out to call these people.
[00:18:16.255 --> 00:18:17.556]  I still like Bush, Alex.
[00:18:17.636 --> 00:18:19.957]  I just can't believe they're not doing anything for our trip.
[00:18:21.658 --> 00:18:23.839]  You just love to be... I mean, I have no respect for you!
[00:18:24.419 --> 00:18:27.561]  You're being raped by this system, and you still love it.
[00:18:27.641 --> 00:18:28.321]  Oh, thank you!
[00:18:28.482 --> 00:18:29.062]  Rape me!
[00:18:29.162 --> 00:18:29.682]  Rape me!
[00:18:31.663 --> 00:18:33.084]  So... and none of us are safe.
[00:18:33.564 --> 00:18:34.965]  None of us... I mean, we're all in danger.
[00:18:35.225 --> 00:18:37.266]  We have a government that knows DU.
[00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:41.208]  When they deploy it, we'll maim and hurt our military.
[00:18:41.818 --> 00:18:51.701]  And they still do it, and there's a bunch of snot-nosed white trash out there who'll just make excuses about it, make jokes about it, and it's all real funny, and ha ha ha.
[00:18:52.121 --> 00:18:52.922]  I've heard you before.
[00:18:52.962 --> 00:18:53.582]  You've called in.
[00:18:53.642 --> 00:18:56.963]  You've denied that DU is even bad for anybody.
[00:19:00.424 --> 00:19:01.585]  So, okay, fine.
[00:19:04.005 --> 00:19:09.007]  Okay, now I see I've just spent ten minutes on this ranting and raving because it upsets me.
[00:19:11.283 --> 00:19:15.224]  But, uh, let's, uh, let's get into the other news here, because I got a lot of it to cover.
[00:19:15.645 --> 00:19:18.826]  Doctor urges Canadians not to panic over bird flu.
[00:19:18.846 --> 00:19:21.887]  And this is out of, uh, CBC.
[00:19:22.007 --> 00:19:35.332]  One day after officials, not servants, but officials, revealed wild birds carrying the H5 strain of avian flu virus have been found in Canada, the nation's chief public health officer is urging Canadians not to panic.
[00:19:36.357 --> 00:19:49.105]  The first thing to know is that it's a huge leap for the bird virus to become a human virus that spreads efficiently in peoples at Dr. David Butler Jones appearing on CTV's Canada AM.
[00:19:50.245 --> 00:19:51.906]  We'll be right back and tell you what else he said.
[00:19:51.946 --> 00:19:52.987]  It's very important.
[00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:58.050]  Here it is folks, the 2006 Red Book.

[00:20:57.053 --> 00:20:58.697]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[00:20:59.318 --> 00:21:01.062]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[00:21:02.242 --> 00:21:10.129]  The best-kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.

[00:21:54.798 --> 00:21:56.419]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:21:56.559 --> 00:22:00.681]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:22:00.801 --> 00:22:03.683]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:22:03.763 --> 00:22:10.446]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:22:10.646 --> 00:22:13.650]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:22:13.870 --> 00:22:16.252]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:22:16.393 --> 00:22:26.544]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[00:22:26.724 --> 00:22:35.872]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum aren't extracted.
[00:22:36.012 --> 00:22:43.779]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:22:54.807 --> 00:23:01.671]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:23:01.831 --> 00:23:14.718]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:23:14.918 --> 00:23:16.740]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:20.364]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:23:20.645 --> 00:23:24.429]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:23:24.689 --> 00:23:29.635]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.

[00:23:59.352 --> 00:24:01.073]  All right folks, we're back live here.
[00:24:01.093 --> 00:24:10.497]  I want to try to be concise about some of the top headlines and then coming up the next segment we'll go to Alice, Jesse, Eric, Emmett, Mark, many others that are patiently holding.
[00:24:10.577 --> 00:24:15.419]  The total free number to join us on air today is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:15.819 --> 00:24:17.300]  I haven't talked about it in two weeks.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:19.601]  I mean, I barely mentioned it a few weeks ago when it first broke.
[00:24:20.587 --> 00:24:27.552]  You know, a black leader in his area saying, this doctor saying, kill every white person.
[00:24:27.572 --> 00:24:28.913]  Well, that's what Khalid Mohammed said.
[00:24:29.474 --> 00:24:34.237]  Kill the white woman because she is the military manufacturing center.
[00:24:35.778 --> 00:24:38.760]  And that's no different than what Hitler said.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.703]  It's no different than what some of the Zionists have to say about everybody else.
[00:24:42.123 --> 00:24:42.843]  It's no different.
[00:24:42.983 --> 00:24:47.687]  And it feels good, but it's totally destructive.
[00:24:49.017 --> 00:24:53.579]  And so we'll play what this guy has to say.
[00:24:53.619 --> 00:24:55.360]  And boy, he really thinks he's on the cutting edge.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:57.361]  He thinks he's battling for his people.
[00:24:57.761 --> 00:24:59.442]  And he couldn't be helping the New World Order more.
[00:24:59.522 --> 00:25:00.383]  So that's coming up.
[00:25:01.263 --> 00:25:02.684]  There's just so much coming up today.
[00:25:02.724 --> 00:25:04.505]  But here it is.
[00:25:04.685 --> 00:25:07.466]  Dr. urges Canadians not to panic over bird flu.
[00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:12.789]  Dr. David Butler Jones, appearing on CTV's Canada AM.
[00:25:13.914 --> 00:25:39.062]  That's just a tremendous leap and very difficult, and we likely would actually be able to watch that with a surveillance and have better preparation for it, he said, speaking of the fact that the bird virus has not moved from human to human transmission yet, but may, they're not even sure, but may be possible to have the transmission from
[00:25:40.122 --> 00:25:47.684]  animal to human right now, and so many of the cases we've heard of have turned out to be false alarms, have turned out to be fake.
[00:25:48.364 --> 00:25:57.026]  People just died of another flu virus, and then they also find this virus in them, and then claim that it caused it, because it'll make Rumsfeld a bunch of money.
[00:25:58.366 --> 00:26:05.648]  Again, the first thing to know is that it's a huge leap for a bird virus to become a human virus that spreads efficiently in people.
[00:26:08.217 --> 00:26:17.064]  That's just a tremendous leap and very difficult and we likely would actually be able to watch that with the surveillance and have better preparation for it, he said.
[00:26:17.404 --> 00:26:21.067]  In fact, Butler Jones said the avian flu virus had been discovered before.
[00:26:21.527 --> 00:26:25.310]  Every year there's a virus that could potentially mutate.
[00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:27.252]  That's where these viruses come from.
[00:26:27.572 --> 00:26:30.514]  Most flu viruses did mutate out of birds or pigs.
[00:26:31.035 --> 00:26:36.039]  In China or in South Korea where they run the human feces right into big
[00:26:37.615 --> 00:26:49.319]  I don't want to go too much more into it, but it's just total and complete hype, and I'm not going to shut up!
[00:27:00.971 --> 00:27:09.854]  I don't care how many so-called patriots want to run around pulling their hair out, screaming, run to the hills, and trying to freak everybody out.
[00:27:10.234 --> 00:27:11.114]  I'm just not going to.
[00:27:11.154 --> 00:27:13.095]  I'm going to be right about this as usual.
[00:27:13.715 --> 00:27:15.575]  And of course, I'll get no credibility at the end of it.
[00:27:15.835 --> 00:27:17.136]  Planet X isn't going to kill us.
[00:27:17.276 --> 00:27:18.616]  Y2K isn't going to kill us.
[00:27:19.337 --> 00:27:21.437]  Just the endless, end-of-the-world stuff.
[00:27:21.717 --> 00:27:23.978]  Meanwhile, I have Ron Paul on saying the government may.
[00:27:25.316 --> 00:27:27.197]  Institute martial law and take our guns.
[00:27:27.317 --> 00:27:30.138]  Top CIA analysts saying the government may carry out terror attacks.
[00:27:30.479 --> 00:27:31.719]  You know, that just gets ignored.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.341]  Serious, real stuff.
[00:27:34.821 --> 00:27:39.803]  Oh, and I'm not saying the government may not release a bioweapon next month or next year and start killing us.
[00:27:39.843 --> 00:27:40.884]  That's their official plan.
[00:27:41.744 --> 00:27:45.666]  But it's never from the avenue that they are pushing.
[00:27:46.166 --> 00:27:51.009]  You see, they're going to use this to make money, but that's secondary, to set up the police state grid.
[00:27:52.216 --> 00:28:12.968]  Like this bill, they're trying to use this as the fear mechanism to get this bill passed through the House now for forced inoculation and federalization of local emergency management systems and to set up the cod grays to forcibly inject you and your family and give total vaccine liability protection to the vaccine makers in perpetuity across the board.
[00:28:14.089 --> 00:28:19.192]  You see, so it also helps up the police state, gives them liability protection, and they make billions of bucks off of it.
[00:28:20.043 --> 00:28:23.805]  So when they do really launch some type of attack, we're going to be in deep trouble.
[00:28:24.785 --> 00:28:35.490]  And they would have cried wolf so many times, and we would have gone along with them so many times, that when it really happens, people aren't going to know what to do, and people aren't going to take action, and it's going to be devastating.
[00:28:37.171 --> 00:28:39.833]  It's going to be devastating.
[00:28:40.453 --> 00:28:46.876]  And listen, they may announce human flu cases, human bird flu cases anytime now.
[00:28:47.569 --> 00:28:52.754]  And I don't want to hear people running around screaming from the rooftops, See, we told you!
[00:28:53.015 --> 00:28:54.396]  There's four cases!
[00:28:54.716 --> 00:28:55.677]  The government says.
[00:28:56.018 --> 00:28:57.900]  Oh, they've locked down major cities!
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:00.342]  But see, we told you it's real!
[00:29:00.362 --> 00:29:03.025]  That's not real!
[00:29:03.445 --> 00:29:04.486]  That's not a pandemic!
[00:29:04.527 --> 00:29:05.488]  That's not an epidemic!
[00:29:05.688 --> 00:29:07.490]  That's made up baloney!
[00:29:07.850 --> 00:29:09.752]  Just like SARS, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:29:11.238 --> 00:29:20.645]  We have the top scientists in Spain, the top scientists in Russia, the top scientists in Canada, top epidemiologists and virologists here, all saying the same thing.
[00:29:21.365 --> 00:29:22.466]  That it's a hoax.
[00:29:22.987 --> 00:29:24.027]  That it's a fraud.
[00:29:24.688 --> 00:29:34.875]  Don't worry, George Bush says it's really, really serious, and the CDC says it, and so does the World Health Organization, and so does a whole gaggle of people on other networks.
[00:29:36.316 --> 00:29:37.357]  Now they're teaching us.
[00:29:38.052 --> 00:29:39.453]  Well, not here.
[00:29:39.794 --> 00:29:41.315]  We got credibility.
[00:29:41.956 --> 00:29:43.657]  We're not gonna blow our credibility.
[00:29:45.179 --> 00:29:46.099]  We're on the march.
[00:29:46.580 --> 00:29:48.181]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:49.102 --> 00:29:51.785]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:29:56.101 --> 00:29:57.703]  Government is best, which governs least.
[00:29:58.263 --> 00:29:59.565]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:00.005 --> 00:30:02.708]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:03.168 --> 00:30:05.811]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:12.698]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:35.002]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[00:30:35.162 --> 00:30:35.502]  Have you?
[00:30:36.083 --> 00:30:37.604]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:30:41.808 --> 00:30:45.812]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:30:46.272 --> 00:30:47.333]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:30:47.874 --> 00:30:49.075]  Osama bin Ferdinand.

[00:30:54.958 --> 00:30:56.939]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[00:30:57.019 --> 00:31:07.723]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:08.103 --> 00:31:12.625]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:12.685 --> 00:31:24.029]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:24.609 --> 00:31:31.457]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:31.857 --> 00:31:33.999]  Your purified water is now ready!
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:39.465]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 Host Filter Elements.
[00:31:39.765 --> 00:31:45.912]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[00:31:55.239 --> 00:32:03.885]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis, or chronic joint symptoms, at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[00:32:04.245 --> 00:32:08.509]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[00:32:09.309 --> 00:32:13.252]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[00:32:13.592 --> 00:32:18.636]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[00:32:19.056 --> 00:32:29.263]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care, whose safety and effectiveness in supporting healthy joints has been established in over 50 clinical trials and research studies.
[00:32:29.563 --> 00:32:36.646]  Joint care facilitates freedom of movement by promoting circulation and enhancing the overall functioning of the musculoskeletal system.
[00:32:36.927 --> 00:32:41.489]  Don't let arthritis stop you from doing the things you enjoy or leading a normal, healthy and active life.

[00:32:45.571 --> 00:32:45.791]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:32:56.198 --> 00:33:01.359]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:02.019 --> 00:33:04.380]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:15.001]  Look, I get mad at end-of-the-world stuff because it's like heroin or cocaine.
[00:33:15.862 --> 00:33:24.063]  The more you do it, the more you push it, the more you use it, the more you lose your credibility, the more people don't listen to you,
[00:33:25.306 --> 00:33:36.336]  And the more fear-mongering it takes next time, if you talk about things that are not totally provable and demonstrable, just because you like to generate hysteria.
[00:33:37.774 --> 00:33:42.757]  Now, we should be freaked out about a whole host of issues, but see, people never get freaked out about those.
[00:33:43.038 --> 00:33:46.340]  The government has to first start the ball rolling.
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:51.663]  Still, even though they're totally discredited, and if you ask the average American if they trust the government, they'll say, no way.
[00:33:52.044 --> 00:33:54.085]  What do you distrust the most of anything out there?
[00:33:54.365 --> 00:33:56.086]  You know, used car salesmen and the government.
[00:33:56.707 --> 00:33:59.829]  Which I think used car salesmen get a bad rap, where as compared to the government.
[00:34:01.627 --> 00:34:04.088]  But still, if they say it, we'll buy into it.
[00:34:04.688 --> 00:34:06.308]  And folks, that's very dangerous.
[00:34:06.828 --> 00:34:08.589]  These are trial balloons.
[00:34:09.489 --> 00:34:11.390]  Remember two and a half years ago?
[00:34:11.430 --> 00:34:13.210]  We're going to be hit by smallpox.
[00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:14.210]  It will happen.
[00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:19.172]  14 million medical workers, first responders, firefighters, policemen.
[00:34:19.192 --> 00:34:19.792]  14 million people.
[00:34:20.312 --> 00:34:21.412]  You've got to take it.
[00:34:21.813 --> 00:34:22.713]  We're ordering you to.
[00:34:23.033 --> 00:34:24.613]  And literally, no one did.
[00:34:24.673 --> 00:34:26.794]  It was 99 plus percent said no.
[00:34:28.203 --> 00:34:33.908]  And so suddenly, suddenly the smallpox, we weren't about to be hit by Al-Qaeda, you know, the intelligence, they've got it, they're going to hit us.
[00:34:34.228 --> 00:34:36.810]  Suddenly that wasn't it because their own enforcers won't take it.
[00:34:37.211 --> 00:34:44.336]  They then can't make a bunch of money selling it and giving, you know, hundreds of millions or billions of doses worldwide of it out to everybody.
[00:34:44.356 --> 00:34:45.077]  Do you understand that?
[00:34:46.038 --> 00:34:52.183]  So see, since we didn't buy that hype, we didn't buy the fraud, we didn't get taken for a ride,
[00:34:53.328 --> 00:34:55.629]  They moved on to SARS.
[00:34:56.209 --> 00:35:05.851]  Oh, and they had drugs then that would treat it, and it was stockpiling, and tens of millions made, and it led back to major administration officials, and big money in Europe.
[00:35:05.871 --> 00:35:06.791]  But oh, so what?
[00:35:07.051 --> 00:35:08.852]  You know, SARS will kill a billion.
[00:35:09.112 --> 00:35:09.672]  It will.
[00:35:09.892 --> 00:35:12.013]  It will, but we have a product that will heal you.
[00:35:12.333 --> 00:35:14.313]  You know, and just the government's got something.
[00:35:14.953 --> 00:35:15.933]  You need the shot.
[00:35:16.013 --> 00:35:17.294]  You need this injection.
[00:35:17.354 --> 00:35:19.754]  We have this pill for you.
[00:35:20.154 --> 00:35:21.095]  It will fix it.
[00:35:21.155 --> 00:35:22.095]  It will save you.
[00:35:24.384 --> 00:35:25.506]  And then that blew over.
[00:35:25.546 --> 00:35:26.247]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:35:26.347 --> 00:35:27.328]  More federal laws.
[00:35:27.389 --> 00:35:28.390]  More federal control.
[00:35:28.891 --> 00:35:30.533]  More emergency management drills.
[00:35:30.633 --> 00:35:32.015]  Practicing federal takeover.
[00:35:32.295 --> 00:35:35.901]  Oh, now we need troops to take your guns during an emergency.
[00:35:35.941 --> 00:35:38.825]  We can't have you being armed during a flu outbreak.
[00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:48.564]  As if the government, even though there was some deadly pandemic that killed tens of millions of people, as if they could even help us or take care of us, they'll guarantee they'll make it worse.
[00:35:49.044 --> 00:35:51.967]  But, see, they're going to demonstrate by having fake false alarms.
[00:35:52.667 --> 00:35:56.490]  I mean, I have no doubt they're not going to find some cases in Canada or Europe or the U.S.
[00:35:56.550 --> 00:36:00.093]  and shut things down and see the martial law kept you safe.
[00:36:00.153 --> 00:36:04.477]  And, oh, they'll probably have somebody who tries to run quarantine and they'll be shot.
[00:36:04.837 --> 00:36:08.220]  And, well, it's sad he's dead, but that kept us safe.
[00:36:09.850 --> 00:36:16.555]  They'll all buy into it, and again, it's this being bathed in enslavement, bathed in tyranny.
[00:36:17.896 --> 00:36:23.099]  Meanwhile, the government is openly, in the US and England, pushing to try to make vaccines mandatory.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:30.444]  Hundreds of new ones, and they're trying to engineer it, they've successfully done it, into food, into potatoes and corns.
[00:36:30.464 --> 00:36:31.225]  You don't have a choice.
[00:36:32.145 --> 00:36:33.166]  It's just going to be in the food.
[00:36:33.887 --> 00:36:37.229]  And live viruses, as I ended the show with yesterday,
[00:36:37.913 --> 00:36:41.276]  You heard I had the big vaccine awareness president on there.
[00:36:41.316 --> 00:36:42.217]  I go, yes, that's true.
[00:36:42.817 --> 00:36:45.599]  And it's not that we need to have her go, oh, that's true, to prove it's true.
[00:36:45.639 --> 00:36:49.222]  You can go read BBC, London Independent, Associated Press.
[00:36:50.744 --> 00:37:01.753]  They're trying to make us take a shot that openly has a virus that attacks your brain and attacks and creates plaques in the receptor points for opiates.
[00:37:03.061 --> 00:37:06.323]  Which, i.e., is your endorphins, will actually make it to where you're unhappy.
[00:37:06.543 --> 00:37:08.944]  But don't worry, they're going to have a drug that will treat that.
[00:37:09.984 --> 00:37:13.046]  I mean, this is literally Brave New World.
[00:37:13.486 --> 00:37:14.726]  Literal.
[00:37:14.786 --> 00:37:15.407]  We are there.
[00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:18.228]  That's something we should be hysterical about.
[00:37:18.608 --> 00:37:27.852]  The fact that transponders from Oregon to Texas are going into the inspection stickers to track, trace, tax us and give us tickets.
[00:37:28.352 --> 00:37:28.733]  Openly.
[00:37:28.933 --> 00:37:29.453]  Publicly.
[00:37:30.243 --> 00:37:30.643]  Openly!
[00:37:30.824 --> 00:37:31.324]  Publicly!
[00:37:31.604 --> 00:37:32.805]  That is insane!
[00:37:33.085 --> 00:37:43.532]  The fact that the big three voting machine companies are openly run by the CIA, are open government front groups, caught engaging in fraud coast-to-coast every election, hundreds of times per election.
[00:37:43.772 --> 00:37:45.033]  That is totally insane!
[00:37:45.473 --> 00:37:52.018]  I mean, I have mainstream articles yesterday where the government's now declassified that they dumped thousands of tons of
[00:37:52.893 --> 00:37:58.355]  Sarin, mustard, chemical, weapons, you name it, nuclear reactors.
[00:37:58.855 --> 00:38:00.635]  We know the Russians did it, but now our government.
[00:38:00.896 --> 00:38:07.238]  Our government would just knowingly go out and dump that right into the ocean, knowing we're going to eat that.
[00:38:08.138 --> 00:38:12.659]  The New World Order would order that, knowing they're going to sit down and eat seafood.
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:17.801]  Their kids, the elite's children, are going to eat that seafood.
[00:38:19.309 --> 00:38:24.933]  And then they find all these weird toxins and all these big fish dyes and red tides and this stuff never goes away.
[00:38:26.393 --> 00:38:29.215]  Again, that is insanity by this elite.
[00:38:30.256 --> 00:38:35.439]  That is, that's something you ought to be, folks, we've had Nobel Prize winners in genetics on this show.
[00:38:35.739 --> 00:38:40.542]  People who worked for Big Pharma and the big genetic engineers, the highest levels, who would do the test.
[00:38:41.022 --> 00:38:45.165]  Another report here today, all the mother rats that ate the GM corn died.
[00:38:45.951 --> 00:38:50.012]  It isn't just that GM food isn't good for you and doesn't give you nutrition, that we're now eating.
[00:38:50.132 --> 00:38:54.493]  It's poisonous because it creates new amino acids and new enzymes that are unknown.
[00:38:56.874 --> 00:38:59.194]  That we cannot absorb, that are toxic to us.
[00:39:00.555 --> 00:39:06.296]  And that's why there's all these new allergies, and no matter how much you work out and how healthy you try to be, still there's all these new weird health problems.
[00:39:07.336 --> 00:39:10.137]  So many medical studies, so many medical doctors are now saying that.
[00:39:11.457 --> 00:39:13.418]  Foreign allergies are just exploding.
[00:39:15.164 --> 00:39:17.266]  50 years ago, nobody was allergic to corn.
[00:39:19.207 --> 00:39:23.910]  Over 98% of all known corn species, and there are hundreds of varieties, are now infected.
[00:39:25.392 --> 00:39:26.292]  And there's no going back.
[00:39:26.472 --> 00:39:27.973]  There's no ever removing it out.
[00:39:28.013 --> 00:39:28.554]  You understand?
[00:39:29.054 --> 00:39:29.595]  You understand?
[00:39:29.615 --> 00:39:32.457]  They don't just have to put it in every variety of corn.
[00:39:32.657 --> 00:39:35.659]  The corn is interrelated and it spreads into the other subspecies.
[00:39:37.874 --> 00:39:39.616]  The other varieties, I should say.
[00:39:39.736 --> 00:39:49.747]  I mean, this, you talk about... I want to start an environmental group, not to steal farmers' and ranchers' land and steal property from people and then give it to the city to build golf courses on.
[00:39:49.947 --> 00:39:51.409]  That's just land-grabbing front groups.
[00:39:53.271 --> 00:39:56.514]  No, to, like, literally go out and stop this genetic engineering.
[00:39:56.734 --> 00:40:00.198]  I mean, they'll take four, five, six species, cram it into some fish,
[00:40:01.337 --> 00:40:06.064]  Pig, human, tomato into a fish and release the fish into the Atlantic Ocean.
[00:40:06.405 --> 00:40:07.887]  Release it into the Pacific Ocean.
[00:40:08.548 --> 00:40:10.932]  They'll release it into the river, into the Mississippi.
[00:40:14.295 --> 00:40:20.538]  And top scientists say it could give rise to deadly viruses that make the bird flu look like a joke, folks.
[00:40:20.778 --> 00:40:22.779]  And the government admits they don't even know what it'll do.
[00:40:22.979 --> 00:40:30.862]  They got level 4 bioviruses 39,000 times more deadly than the Spanish flu of 1918 up in Wisconsin.
[00:40:31.102 --> 00:40:32.483]  They got nuclear reactors
[00:40:32.543 --> 00:40:43.628]  in almost every major city that you don't even know about, like right here in Austin, Texas, that you can drive a truck up to, and there's no cops guarding it, no nothing, because the government knows no terrorist is going to attack that unless they want them to.
[00:40:43.808 --> 00:40:47.990]  They hit a button, and terror teams will start attacking the minute they hit that button.
[00:40:48.211 --> 00:40:50.352]  George Bush and his bosses give one order.
[00:40:51.992 --> 00:40:59.436]  Um, you know, they're telling us we've got a terror threat, but our border's wide open, and there's a big old nuclear reactor about ten miles from where I sit.
[00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.771]  You want to start pulling your hair out?
[00:41:03.031 --> 00:41:05.653]  You start freaking out about that, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:07.794 --> 00:41:10.916]  We need to get our priorities straight around here.
[00:41:12.537 --> 00:41:14.038]  You want to be freaked out?
[00:41:14.098 --> 00:41:16.259]  Don't go to the government begging you to keep you safe.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:17.800]  We may need martial law.
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:18.561]  This is now public.
[00:41:18.621 --> 00:41:23.104]  Ron Paul said they may use this for martial law and gun confiscation and to set up the dictatorship.
[00:41:23.504 --> 00:41:24.505]  That's why they're not worried.
[00:41:24.645 --> 00:41:25.625]  That's why they're so arrogant.
[00:41:25.745 --> 00:41:26.586]  They may do it!
[00:41:29.634 --> 00:41:30.475]  We're on the edge!
[00:41:30.515 --> 00:41:32.397]  We're at the end of the cargory right now!
[00:41:32.878 --> 00:41:36.562]  And if we say no, like we did to the smallpox, and say you're liars?
[00:41:37.524 --> 00:41:40.307]  Like so many doctors came out and said, this doesn't protect you from smallpox.
[00:41:40.507 --> 00:41:42.109]  This vaccine's deadly poisonous.
[00:41:42.149 --> 00:41:42.810]  I'm not taking it.
[00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:46.094]  Top virologists, top epidemiologists, top MDs.
[00:41:46.614 --> 00:41:48.617]  And so the cops went, I ain't taking it neither!
[00:41:49.702 --> 00:41:51.342]  Those police would have taken it in a minute.
[00:41:51.643 --> 00:41:53.103]  Those firefighters would have taken it in a minute.
[00:41:53.483 --> 00:41:56.964]  Those school teachers, those nurses, all of them.
[00:41:57.104 --> 00:41:58.384]  They all would have taken it.
[00:41:58.824 --> 00:42:02.005]  City workers, if the doctors wouldn't have gone public.
[00:42:02.045 --> 00:42:03.385]  And so the AMA's nuts!
[00:42:03.405 --> 00:42:07.427]  And then finally, Tommy Thompson, by the end, who'd been pushing it, said, I wouldn't take it.
[00:42:07.887 --> 00:42:08.307]  Remember that?
[00:42:08.587 --> 00:42:14.008]  Now he's out bouncing around at high schools all over the country and elementary schools telling kids to take microchips.
[00:42:14.328 --> 00:42:17.169]  See how we're living in a twilight zone situation?
[00:42:18.371 --> 00:42:18.791]  Literally!
[00:42:18.831 --> 00:42:21.333]  We're living in a twilight zone movie!
[00:42:23.615 --> 00:42:33.322]  Remember back in the 80's those sci-fi horror movies where in the future it's a police state and the police wear black uniforms and Nazi helmets and they march around and they inject you with stuff to fry your brain?
[00:42:33.843 --> 00:42:35.724]  See, that was all out of UN documents.
[00:42:36.104 --> 00:42:40.608]  All those movies and all those books got written and made because that's the real plan.
[00:42:43.183 --> 00:42:45.124]  We have Henry Kissinger's own documents.
[00:42:45.164 --> 00:42:46.565]  We have the World Health Organization.
[00:42:46.605 --> 00:42:51.208]  We have the Population Organization out of New York's own documents.
[00:42:51.248 --> 00:42:53.309]  We have David Rockefeller saying it.
[00:42:53.329 --> 00:42:54.950]  We have the Communist Chinese saying it.
[00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:58.812]  We have Prince Philip, Ted Turner, Jacques Cousteau, Maurice Strong.
[00:42:59.052 --> 00:43:05.916]  The list goes on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
[00:43:06.216 --> 00:43:08.498]  They're openly saying they want to kill us!
[00:43:09.398 --> 00:43:11.479]  And that leads me now to this
[00:43:14.386 --> 00:43:14.906]  Individual.
[00:43:17.448 --> 00:43:19.930]  That brings me now to this individual.
[00:43:21.191 --> 00:43:22.932]  Exterminating white people.
[00:43:23.052 --> 00:43:31.058]  It has been an assertion of mine that there's only one difference between Adolf Hitler and some of the misbegotten souls who lurk among us.
[00:43:31.839 --> 00:43:35.281]  Means I don't know that I subscribe to the notion that power corrupts.
[00:43:35.962 --> 00:43:36.702]  Of course it does.
[00:43:37.403 --> 00:43:38.264]  I'm telling the writer that.
[00:43:38.564 --> 00:43:42.747]  But I do know that it releases inhibitions causing one's true colors to shine through.
[00:43:43.644 --> 00:44:03.537]  Inhibitions, however, don't seem to bedevil when Dr. Kamboo Kambon, the Raleigh, North Carolina activist, bookstore owner, and former professor at North Carolina State University, associated with and advocated the extermination of white people while speaking at a pro-black media forum at
[00:44:04.221 --> 00:44:10.308]  Howard Law School in an event that was covered in its entirety by C-SPAN.
[00:44:10.628 --> 00:44:12.130]  By the way, if you've got a tape of that, I want it.
[00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:13.331]  All I have is the audio of it.
[00:44:13.592 --> 00:44:14.433]  And I didn't talk about it.
[00:44:14.453 --> 00:44:15.654]  I mentioned this two weeks ago.
[00:44:15.674 --> 00:44:19.178]  And we're going to get to your calls, but I've got to play this and then comment on it.
[00:44:23.214 --> 00:44:26.536]  The reason this clip is so important is this guy's got a lot of the picture.
[00:44:26.796 --> 00:44:29.078]  He knows that they are trying to kill black people.
[00:44:29.478 --> 00:44:33.861]  He knows what they're doing with the vaccines and the GM foods and what's happening.
[00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:35.702]  But folks, they're doing it to everybody, see?
[00:44:36.182 --> 00:44:37.443]  But the globalists love this.
[00:44:37.863 --> 00:44:39.884]  They got the mecha crowd saying the same thing.
[00:44:39.924 --> 00:44:42.686]  Plan a San Diego to kill every white male above the age of 16.
[00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.348]  And local civil rights groups defend it.
[00:44:45.368 --> 00:44:47.129]  They go, ah, so what?
[00:44:47.149 --> 00:44:47.969]  They're downtrodden.
[00:44:48.910 --> 00:44:50.171]  Well, I'm the minority in Texas.
[00:44:50.191 --> 00:44:50.991]  I don't appreciate that.
[00:44:53.544 --> 00:44:57.865]  Why is it acceptable when this guy says it, or Machigroup say it?
[00:44:58.485 --> 00:45:04.027]  It's not acceptable, and you need to understand, folks, that the globalists are doing this, but they're doing this to everyone.
[00:45:04.847 --> 00:45:11.329]  And to think about how many whites were killed, or lynched, or had their houses blown up, fighting for black people's freedoms.
[00:45:12.589 --> 00:45:15.650]  It's just so insulting, and so hateful, and so mindless.
[00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.831]  You know, I've had black folks before tell me I'm a blue-eyed devil.
[00:45:19.051 --> 00:45:22.752]  I'm sitting there eating at an outdoor restaurant, and a guy walks by and goes, you're a blue-eyed devil?
[00:45:23.810 --> 00:45:24.431]  It's funny.
[00:45:24.531 --> 00:45:25.511]  It's self-righteous.
[00:45:25.872 --> 00:45:29.654]  And you only play into the New World Order's hands when you have this attitude.
[00:45:30.715 --> 00:45:32.376]  So I want to play this and then comment on it.
[00:45:32.676 --> 00:45:41.402]  Go ahead and roll, Dr. Kamu Kambon, who's so self-righteous, just listen to him.
[00:45:41.622 --> 00:45:42.282]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:45:43.983 --> 00:45:51.628]  I taught on the college level for a number of years at a so-called black college, and I'm down against black colleges.
[00:45:51.648 --> 00:45:52.829]  I'm going to tell you straight up.
[00:45:53.373 --> 00:45:56.294]  Because some of the madness that's going on in these schools.
[00:45:57.195 --> 00:46:01.316]  But what I want to say is that there are two things going on on the planet now.
[00:46:01.897 --> 00:46:09.160]  One is that when white people came to us and said, we're going to free you, we're going to emancipate you from the plantation.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:17.644]  What they did was extended the boundaries of the plantation and made it an international plantation.
[00:46:19.104 --> 00:46:20.585]  Made us think that we were free.
[00:46:21.801 --> 00:46:29.248]  In addition to that, they made every white person on earth a plantation master or owner.
[00:46:31.029 --> 00:46:32.450]  So there are two things in operation.
[00:46:32.490 --> 00:46:34.372]  We are in an international prison.
[00:46:36.174 --> 00:46:39.637]  Not just in America, but everywhere we go, our people are dying.
[00:46:40.778 --> 00:46:45.542]  So the things that are in operation on this planet is that white people want to kill us.
[00:46:45.822 --> 00:46:47.123]  I want you to understand that.
[00:46:47.623 --> 00:46:49.225]  They want to kill you.
[00:46:50.279 --> 00:47:01.625]  And it has nothing to do with what kind of degree you have, what kind of car you have, what kind of title you have, what fraternity you belong to, what religion you belong to.
[00:47:01.726 --> 00:47:05.568]  They want to kill you because that is part of their plan.
[00:47:06.488 --> 00:47:08.990]  There are any number of reasons why they want to do that.
[00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:12.972]  I'm not going to waste my time trying to figure out why they want to kill us.
[00:47:14.233 --> 00:47:15.934]  But I know that's what they want to do.
[00:47:16.094 --> 00:47:18.415]  And they want to do it in many different ways.
[00:47:19.739 --> 00:47:31.250]  Psychological, economic, cultural, spiritual, social, biological, chemical, electromagnetic, they want to kill you.
[00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:36.915]  But, they also want to make money in the process of your death.
[00:47:37.655 --> 00:47:40.498]  Now I saw a brother when I was coming and he was smoking a cigarette.
[00:47:40.878 --> 00:47:45.883]  So now he's going to kill himself, but they're going to make money off of his death process.
[00:47:47.975 --> 00:48:12.051]  The other thing is that they want us to, if they don't kill us like they tried to kill the brother by beating him up in New Orleans, if they don't kill us that way, or shooting like they killed the brother in Cincinnati, or like they killed Malice Green in Detroit, or like they killed Greenage up in Pittsburgh, if they don't come out right and kill us straight, they want to get us to kill ourselves.
[00:48:12.912 --> 00:48:15.674]  Now these are the only two operations on the planet.
[00:48:16.607 --> 00:48:19.348]  The other thing is that there's only one nigger on the planet.
[00:48:19.448 --> 00:48:20.628]  I never use that word.
[00:48:20.909 --> 00:48:22.169]  This is the first time I've used it.
[00:48:22.189 --> 00:48:23.429]  I don't even think that word.
[00:48:23.649 --> 00:48:25.450]  But there's only one nigger on the planet.
[00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:30.672]  And the nigger that's on the planet is the one that is destroying the water.
[00:48:31.292 --> 00:48:32.993]  The one that's polluting the air.
[00:48:33.413 --> 00:48:36.694]  The one that is exploiting people and resources.
[00:48:36.854 --> 00:48:40.595]  And the only nigger on the planet is the white man and the white woman.
[00:48:41.356 --> 00:48:43.196]  And then our people are not niggers.
[00:48:43.236 --> 00:48:44.717]  We are imitation niggers.
[00:48:48.172 --> 00:48:57.698]  Now, what we have to do is we have to devise a system or a plan for ourselves.
[00:48:57.758 --> 00:49:00.540]  And I said earlier that each one of you is a system.
[00:49:01.241 --> 00:49:05.824]  And everything that you do, every thought that you think, either you are supporting
[00:49:06.582 --> 00:49:15.568]  White world terror domination by your actions, what you buy, what you wear, where you go, what you eat, how you use your time.
[00:49:16.108 --> 00:49:22.432]  You are either supporting the white people in their process of death or you're for African liberation.
[00:49:22.512 --> 00:49:23.352]  It's one or the other.
[00:49:24.633 --> 00:49:27.815]  And if we don't use our time wisely,
[00:49:30.154 --> 00:49:33.356]  Then we are engaging in a form of subtle suicide.
[00:49:33.636 --> 00:49:36.438]  Because as I said earlier, their system is still going on.
[00:49:36.778 --> 00:49:39.139]  They still have these images on TV that are going on.
[00:49:39.420 --> 00:49:41.841]  They're still warehousing our children into special ed.
[00:49:42.241 --> 00:49:43.102]  Giving them Ritalin.
[00:49:43.882 --> 00:49:45.063]  There are no jobs.
[00:49:45.123 --> 00:49:46.244]  We fill in the hospitals.
[00:49:46.524 --> 00:49:48.125]  So their system is not stopping.
[00:49:49.646 --> 00:49:53.228]  And then finally, I want to say that we need one idea.
[00:49:55.009 --> 00:49:58.011]  And we're not thinking about a solution to the problem.
[00:49:58.675 --> 00:50:04.119]  We're dealing with all these other things, but these are diversions from the solution to the problem.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:19.110]  And we have to start to think about a solution to the problem so that these young brothers and sisters who are here now, who are 15, 16, and 17, are not here 25 years later talking about these same problems.
[00:50:20.031 --> 00:50:25.295]  Now how do I know that the white people know that we are going to come up with a solution to the problem?
[00:50:26.571 --> 00:50:32.276]  I know it because they have retina scans, they have what they call racial profiling, DNA banks.
[00:50:32.296 --> 00:50:32.897]  Alright, pause.
[00:50:33.257 --> 00:50:35.799]  When we come back, we're going to finish this.
[00:50:37.721 --> 00:50:44.947]  Now listen, see this guy sees the control grid going in, but he's so self-centered, it's the black people, why they're the target.
[00:50:45.547 --> 00:50:47.489]  It's free humans, period, buddy.
[00:50:47.809 --> 00:50:50.071]  And you're working for the New World Order, you make me sick.
[00:50:50.091 --> 00:50:51.052]  Put it right back.
[00:50:56.064 --> 00:50:58.945]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:50:59.186 --> 00:51:00.766]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:01.106 --> 00:51:05.769]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:06.129 --> 00:51:12.852]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:51:13.192 --> 00:51:15.173]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:51:15.373 --> 00:51:18.214]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:51:18.314 --> 00:51:22.975]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:23.155 --> 00:51:27.577]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:27.817 --> 00:51:35.019]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:53:41.556 --> 00:53:44.619]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[00:53:44.799 --> 00:53:50.664]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[00:54:03.429 --> 00:54:12.653]  This professor, Dr. Pamu Kambon, is such a perfect example.
[00:54:14.133 --> 00:54:16.014]  The elite want to take care of themselves.
[00:54:16.034 --> 00:54:22.516]  The elite want to make sure they go on into the future, that they have the benefits of technology and life extension systems.
[00:54:23.763 --> 00:54:31.069]  And all of this, so they're going to reduce all of our populations, they're going to cull most of us, they're going to dumb us down, and this is public.
[00:54:31.709 --> 00:54:34.131]  And it's white, black, they don't care folks, it's across the board.
[00:54:35.272 --> 00:54:40.836]  Though they are targeting a lot of their energies, Latin America, Africa, and Asia, because those are the biggest populations.
[00:54:43.298 --> 00:54:44.959]  So a lot of what he's saying is true.
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:50.323]  But they, the cops shoot white people folks, it doesn't ever really make the news, isn't a big deal.
[00:54:51.285 --> 00:54:54.168]  Racial crime is much higher black against white.
[00:54:55.029 --> 00:55:01.515]  I mean, pulling TV cameramen out of vans, beating them because they're white, up in Ohio.
[00:55:01.976 --> 00:55:03.778]  And see, the news doesn't really talk about that.
[00:55:05.399 --> 00:55:11.125]  So see, the elite, the very elite that this guy says are so evil, which they are,
[00:55:11.886 --> 00:55:16.450]  That covers up the fact that they have energized and funded Metro and La Raza.
[00:55:16.810 --> 00:55:19.172]  That they have energized and funded the radical black groups.
[00:55:19.613 --> 00:55:24.237]  Because they want us all fighting with each other down here at the low level, and they're just up there laughing.
[00:55:24.837 --> 00:55:28.040]  You know, as if this guy's call to kill everybody is ever going to happen.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.162]  No, it's just going to call for a race war.
[00:55:31.183 --> 00:55:33.765]  Which is going to energize the white supremacists and all this.
[00:55:34.085 --> 00:55:36.107]  I mean, this guy's just a black supremacist.
[00:55:36.287 --> 00:55:38.429]  If he was a white guy, he'd be saying, kill all the blacks.
[00:55:40.111 --> 00:55:42.372]  So let's go ahead and finish up what this guy has to say.
[00:55:42.652 --> 00:55:43.333]  Go ahead and roll it.
[00:55:44.433 --> 00:55:49.736]  Now how do I know that the white people know that we are going to come up with a solution to the problem?
[00:55:50.997 --> 00:56:04.984]  I know it because they have retina scans, they have what they call racial profiling, DNA banks, and they're monitoring our people to try to prevent the one person from coming up with the one idea.
[00:56:06.324 --> 00:56:08.966]  And the one idea is how
[00:56:09.853 --> 00:56:16.677]  We are going to exterminate white people because that, in my estimation, is the only conclusion I have come to.
[00:56:17.017 --> 00:56:22.120]  We have to exterminate white people off of the face of the planet to solve this problem.
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:31.805]  Now, I don't care whether you clap or not, but I'm saying to you that we need to solve this problem because they are going to kill us.
[00:56:33.286 --> 00:56:34.687]  And I will leave on that.
[00:56:34.827 --> 00:56:44.370]  So we have to just set up our own system and stop playing and get very serious and not be diverted from coming up with a solution to the problem.
[00:56:44.751 --> 00:56:47.472]  And the problem on the planet is white people.
[00:56:47.592 --> 00:56:48.992]  Okay, let's stop right there.
[00:56:49.252 --> 00:56:54.614]  Conservatively, even in African history, Africa is one of the most barbarous countries ever seen.
[00:56:55.275 --> 00:56:58.396]  Cannibalism, mass murder, slavery being institutionalized.
[00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:01.150]  And I haven't defended Europe.
[00:57:01.350 --> 00:57:02.611]  Very barbarous as well.
[00:57:02.731 --> 00:57:03.712]  Asia, very barbarous.
[00:57:04.413 --> 00:57:09.877]  But, you know, this thing about how black people were these angel creatures before the evil whites showed up.
[00:57:09.918 --> 00:57:13.140]  And then so many blacks take on Muslim names and Muslim culture.
[00:57:13.721 --> 00:57:23.049]  And that's who started the real slave export was the Arabs out of Khartoum and there in Somalia as well, not just in Libya.
[00:57:25.083 --> 00:57:34.411]  So there's a total disconnect, or by black folks that have studied it, they'll say, well, some of them will say, well, you know Alex, slavery was different in our countries.
[00:57:35.072 --> 00:57:36.754]  Yeah, yeah, whatever, or in your tribes.
[00:57:38.295 --> 00:57:40.777]  So don't sit there and say white people are the problem, okay?
[00:57:41.057 --> 00:57:42.178]  See, that plays into it.
[00:57:42.218 --> 00:57:43.940]  The problem is evil people.
[00:57:44.621 --> 00:57:48.284]  And let me just tell black folks this, because you heard quite a bit of clapping in there.
[00:57:49.639 --> 00:57:52.401]  This is a sizable group of blacks who think all whites should be killed.
[00:57:52.441 --> 00:57:53.422]  Same thing with Hispanics.
[00:57:53.442 --> 00:57:56.524]  They think a large group of Hispanics think all whites should be killed.
[00:57:56.584 --> 00:57:58.966]  Not the majority, but it's quite popular.
[00:58:00.427 --> 00:58:04.329]  Do you expect us to just sit here and just twiddle our thumbs and listen to this?
[00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:09.113]  I'm not going to run out and join the Aryan Nations, but I am going to speak out against what you're doing.
[00:58:09.393 --> 00:58:13.335]  The Aryan Nations is only going to make it worse, and again, the New World Order is going to play that off against each other.
[00:58:14.096 --> 00:58:15.537]  But I haven't done anything to black people.
[00:58:16.517 --> 00:58:20.720]  If anything, I experienced black racism against myself growing up in Dallas, Texas.
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:22.661]  But I had a lot of black friends, though.
[00:58:22.681 --> 00:58:24.262]  That didn't mean I disliked all blacks.
[00:58:24.822 --> 00:58:27.504]  So it's really destructive what you're doing.
[00:58:28.104 --> 00:58:31.386]  And you see this control grid going into place, you need to know it's for everybody.
[00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:38.971]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[00:58:39.311 --> 00:58:40.172]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:51.267 --> 00:58:51.907]  Big Brother.
[00:58:52.587 --> 00:58:53.628]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:54.348 --> 00:58:55.509]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:56.129 --> 00:58:56.949]  You want answers?
[00:58:57.690 --> 00:58:59.210]  Well, so does he.
[00:58:59.250 --> 00:59:03.232]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:03.432 --> 00:59:07.594]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:11.936 --> 00:59:15.918]  Why is it, if the government wants to kill all black people,
[00:59:17.419 --> 00:59:19.880]  Or excuse me, white people want to kill all black people.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:33.124]  But the government is so careful about keeping this quiet, and there's never big NBC Nightly News specials about people like Dr. Kamu Kambon, the professor, who gets on C-SPAN and says, kill all whites.
[00:59:34.944 --> 00:59:36.365]  Or Khalid Mohammed or anybody.
[00:59:36.405 --> 00:59:39.626]  You know, in a big room full of big, big auditorium full of people.
[00:59:41.726 --> 00:59:43.187]  And he's up there on, uh,
[00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.542]  TV and just says, let's start killing all whites.
[00:59:48.322 --> 00:59:54.727]  I mean, imagine if you or I got up on air, and let's say you're black, and you said kill all blacks, you'd probably be arrested.
[00:59:55.227 --> 00:59:57.529]  Or if you're white and you said kill all blacks, you'd be arrested.
[00:59:58.070 --> 00:59:59.631]  Why is it acceptable?
[00:59:59.671 --> 01:00:03.253]  Because look, whites are the biggest section of the middle class.
[01:00:05.135 --> 01:00:07.957]  And the elite, no matter what color they are,
[01:00:08.704 --> 01:00:12.328]  Intends to destroy that middle class, whether you're Hispanic, Black, White, whatever.
[01:00:12.628 --> 01:00:15.410]  They don't want any money that isn't in their hands.
[01:00:15.431 --> 01:00:16.772]  They don't want any independence.
[01:00:16.792 --> 01:00:17.713]  They're threatened by it.
[01:00:18.113 --> 01:00:18.954]  They admit they are.
[01:00:19.695 --> 01:00:30.705]  And so they're going to use, quote, the underprivileged groups to destroy the middle class and to merge everybody together into one giant group on the global plantation.
[01:00:31.065 --> 01:00:31.786]  Global serfdom.
[01:00:32.665 --> 01:00:37.966]  But this guy, this professor, thinks that the retina scanners and the Ritalin are to hold down the black kids.
[01:00:37.986 --> 01:00:42.347]  Well, let me tell you, they're retina scanning and thumb scanning everybody, and they're putting everybody on Ritalin, Bubba.
[01:00:42.727 --> 01:00:45.527]  In fact, there are higher levels of white children on Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:00:47.808 --> 01:00:50.148]  So, see, he's got so much of the picture right.
[01:00:50.248 --> 01:00:51.769]  You bet they're trying to kill black people.
[01:00:52.689 --> 01:00:54.669]  But his answer is, kill the whites.
[01:00:55.409 --> 01:00:56.309]  Should I report?
[01:00:57.330 --> 01:00:59.630]  Where should I report to so you can put me up on a guillotine?
[01:01:00.433 --> 01:01:03.434]  I mean, you ought to know how guilty and bleeding-heart whites are.
[01:01:03.474 --> 01:01:04.175]  It's really sick.
[01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:05.575]  Because, I mean, I don't have any guilt.
[01:01:05.596 --> 01:01:06.436]  See, I haven't done anything to you.
[01:01:06.456 --> 01:01:08.637]  I've had nothing against you.
[01:01:10.258 --> 01:01:10.918]  None of this stuff.
[01:01:12.399 --> 01:01:12.719]  None of it.
[01:01:13.819 --> 01:01:16.781]  I'm just a person who wants freedom and liberty.
[01:01:16.961 --> 01:01:17.841]  And I hate corruption.
[01:01:18.382 --> 01:01:21.163]  And I hear mattresses saying, kill all white males.
[01:01:21.841 --> 01:01:26.424]  I go, that's not very friendly, that's racist, and the local civil rights groups say Alex Jones is evil.
[01:01:26.864 --> 01:01:27.985]  These are downtrodden groups.
[01:01:28.145 --> 01:01:28.826]  I've actually said it.
[01:01:28.866 --> 01:01:30.467]  These are downtrodden groups.
[01:01:30.767 --> 01:01:31.508]  So what do they say?
[01:01:31.528 --> 01:01:32.168]  Kill all whites.
[01:01:33.089 --> 01:01:33.569]  About the age of 16.
[01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:37.011]  And the liberal groups are out defending this.
[01:01:37.171 --> 01:01:38.692]  All funded by big corporate money.
[01:01:39.013 --> 01:01:40.714]  Well, so he says kill all whites.
[01:01:40.754 --> 01:01:41.594]  He doesn't really mean it.
[01:01:43.616 --> 01:01:48.219]  And so, you get a riot going because a couple of toothless Klan people are out in Toledo, Ohio.
[01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.941]  And black folks go, let's just start attacking whites!
[01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.982]  Here, let's just punch this old white man in the face!
[01:01:56.242 --> 01:01:58.623]  Here, let's grab some whites out of a car and beat them up!
[01:02:00.144 --> 01:02:01.905]  I mean, look, I got white children, folks!
[01:02:01.945 --> 01:02:06.727]  You think I like the fact that it's well known that blacks routinely attack whites in groups down on 6th Street?
[01:02:06.927 --> 01:02:08.147]  That it happens all over the country?
[01:02:09.128 --> 01:02:13.630]  I don't like it when whites crowd around some black person and beat them up, and I don't like when it happens to whites!
[01:02:13.970 --> 01:02:16.651]  It's tribal, mindless, animal bull!
[01:02:18.385 --> 01:02:23.368]  But oh, we got lots of black professors that'll be out spouting how great it is.
[01:02:25.128 --> 01:02:28.370]  So the minority of blacks that ascribe to this, I gotta worry about.
[01:02:28.750 --> 01:02:30.331]  And I gotta, and see now it creates fear.
[01:02:30.571 --> 01:02:32.632]  You know, are those some of the blacks that think I should be killed?
[01:02:33.012 --> 01:02:35.153]  It's like black folks don't know white folks are racist.
[01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:39.896]  Oh, maybe that's one of those, maybe that's one of those whites that wants to kill me.
[01:02:40.805 --> 01:02:45.087]  And then we're all busy fighting with each other while the New World Order rules over us.
[01:02:45.147 --> 01:02:46.427]  I played that clip in the last segment.
[01:02:46.667 --> 01:02:52.950]  We will come back and go straight to Alice, Jesse, Eric, Emmett, and Phillip.
[01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.950]  And I know I've talked for the last hour.
[01:02:54.970 --> 01:03:03.394]  It's just there was so much news on bird flu and indictments and Gulf War syndrome and black leaders saying kill all the whites.
[01:03:03.434 --> 01:03:04.254]  And you know, I watched.
[01:03:05.547 --> 01:03:11.669]  I hardly ever watched TV, but I watched about two hours of the Millions More March that same weekend I was at the beach.
[01:03:12.790 --> 01:03:13.850]  Late at night, they re-aired it.
[01:03:15.310 --> 01:03:16.411]  And I sat there and watched it.
[01:03:17.371 --> 01:03:19.772]  And there was just a bunch, a lot of it was just white hating.
[01:03:22.653 --> 01:03:24.994]  It's unbelievable.
[01:03:25.034 --> 01:03:26.494]  That's not going to get you anywhere.
[01:03:28.475 --> 01:03:31.376]  In fact, it's going to hurt black people.
[01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:35.298]  Because a lot of these bleeding hearts are starting to hear what you're saying.
[01:03:35.859 --> 01:03:37.000]  They're not bleeding anymore.

[01:03:46.852 --> 01:03:53.714]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:03:54.014 --> 01:03:55.394]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:03:55.574 --> 01:03:57.795]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:03:57.935 --> 01:04:00.015]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:00.296 --> 01:04:05.237]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11, this is the film for you.
[01:04:05.557 --> 01:04:09.598]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:09.858 --> 01:04:11.639]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:11.699 --> 01:04:22.345]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plottable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:22.505 --> 01:04:24.406]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:04:47.896 --> 01:04:48.916]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:49.256 --> 01:04:52.037]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:52.297 --> 01:04:56.459]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:04:56.879 --> 01:04:57.719]  So what do you do?
[01:04:58.019 --> 01:05:02.601]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:03.081 --> 01:05:05.223]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:05.703 --> 01:05:06.604]  Sheltering in Place.
[01:05:07.005 --> 01:05:10.708]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:05:11.028 --> 01:05:20.416]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[01:05:53.295 --> 01:05:58.299]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[01:05:58.639 --> 01:06:06.565]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:06:06.706 --> 01:06:13.751]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:06:13.951 --> 01:06:15.172]  There are no side effects.
[01:06:15.312 --> 01:06:18.715]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:06:18.755 --> 01:06:19.876]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:06:20.176 --> 01:06:21.438]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:06:21.658 --> 01:06:28.484]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[01:06:35.249 --> 01:06:36.570]  Ease the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:06:36.610 --> 01:06:38.591]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:06:38.611 --> 01:06:41.734]  For some reason, John, I keep forgetting to tell you to cue it up.
[01:06:41.774 --> 01:06:42.754]  This is the last minute.
[01:07:01.461 --> 01:07:15.249]  of Dr. Camu Cambon, former professor at North Carolina State University, activist and bookstore owner, and he says, hey, I found the secret solution!
[01:07:15.649 --> 01:07:17.210]  Kill all white people!
[01:07:19.171 --> 01:07:28.637]  And again, I mentioned this a few weeks ago, but I hadn't, I had just heard on the radio a little bitty clip of what he said at the end.
[01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:37.456]  I was intrigued when I heard about how the whites are building this total control grid of retina scanning and tracking and everything to kill us.
[01:07:37.496 --> 01:07:38.877]  It's a control grid to kill us!
[01:07:40.398 --> 01:07:41.179]  And he's right!
[01:07:41.239 --> 01:07:44.621]  If you actually read the documents though, it's a control grid to contain and control everybody.
[01:07:46.062 --> 01:07:48.524]  And they're putting us on psychotropic drugs to control us.
[01:07:49.185 --> 01:07:50.686]  This is total enslavement!
[01:07:52.287 --> 01:07:53.869]  Play that clip and then I will go right to your calls.
[01:07:53.889 --> 01:07:54.149]  Here it is.
[01:07:55.629 --> 01:08:09.647]  I know it because they have retina scans, they have what they call racial profiling, DNA banks, and they're monitoring our people to try to prevent the one person from coming up with the one idea.
[01:08:10.969 --> 01:08:12.491]  And the one idea is how
[01:08:14.494 --> 01:08:21.318]  We are going to exterminate white people because that, in my estimation, is the only conclusion I have come to.
[01:08:21.658 --> 01:08:26.741]  We have to exterminate white people off of the face of the planet to solve this problem.
[01:08:28.022 --> 01:08:36.467]  Now, I don't care whether you clap or not, but I'm saying to you that we need to solve this problem because they are going to kill us.
[01:08:37.828 --> 01:08:43.691]  Alright, let me just say this, and in closing, it will go to your calls, I know they're going to be all over the map on other issues,
[01:08:46.346 --> 01:08:56.229]  Understand that when Greece was taken over by the Persians and by the Turks, they had a racial policy of raping all the women.
[01:08:56.989 --> 01:08:59.890]  And they said, it's because you're going to be Turks, you're going to be Persians.
[01:09:02.031 --> 01:09:04.752]  The same thing has happened all over the world right now.
[01:09:06.592 --> 01:09:08.533]  It's the official Chinese government policy.
[01:09:08.573 --> 01:09:12.894]  They went in, they've done it for 30 years, raping and killing the Tibetans.
[01:09:14.415 --> 01:09:15.215]  Killing the males,
[01:09:15.914 --> 01:09:17.135]  Raping the females.
[01:09:18.275 --> 01:09:21.016]  They force Tibetan women to marry Chinese men.
[01:09:22.837 --> 01:09:25.559]  And people could say, well, gee, that's multiculturalism.
[01:09:25.939 --> 01:09:28.060]  Well, how dare them not want to marry a Chinese man?
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:30.321]  And I don't think it's Chinese, folks.
[01:09:30.341 --> 01:09:33.362]  The point is, is that China knows that's how they kill a culture.
[01:09:33.742 --> 01:09:36.203]  That's how they take over, and the liberals are horrified by that.
[01:09:36.424 --> 01:09:37.784]  But what is multiculturalism?
[01:09:38.184 --> 01:09:41.626]  I mean, listen, before I decided to go down and protest the Desi Says parade,
[01:09:42.725 --> 01:09:45.967]  I called up some of the directors of it, and I was like, hey, do you believe in Mecha and the Race?
[01:09:46.568 --> 01:09:47.168]  Uh, yes, we do.
[01:09:48.169 --> 01:09:50.451]  Well, uh, hey, you're white, aren't you?
[01:09:50.471 --> 01:09:51.051]  Uh, yes.
[01:09:51.331 --> 01:09:52.512]  Why haven't you interbred with us?
[01:09:52.552 --> 01:09:53.053]  You're racist.
[01:09:53.293 --> 01:09:54.313]  We're gonna get your women.
[01:09:54.594 --> 01:10:06.342]  I mean, the guy was actually saying this to me, and I'm going, well, you know, the woman wants to date whoever she wants, but, you know, that's one issue, but to just say, we're gonna get your women, we're gonna get your race, we're gonna take your race down.
[01:10:07.103 --> 01:10:11.606]  And I'm going, well, since you put it in those terms, you know, it's like,
[01:10:12.342 --> 01:10:27.629]  Seeing white women, and when they're 15 years old, and whatever, going after them, you know, these 18, 20 year old males, literally, it's in the rap songs, ha ha ha, I knocked up the dumb white, you know, bitch.
[01:10:29.029 --> 01:10:31.971]  Literally, it's like we're being hunted or something, and it's funny.
[01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:39.634]  And the media, and Sumner, Redstone, and the whole culture, it's all up there, pushing it, driving it, the old white men.
[01:10:40.815 --> 01:10:41.595]  They fund it.
[01:10:43.027 --> 01:10:44.507]  You see, they're trying to destroy whites.
[01:10:45.027 --> 01:10:46.628]  They're trying to destroy Hispanic culture.
[01:10:46.788 --> 01:10:48.268]  They're trying to destroy your black culture.
[01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:55.549]  Haven't you guys figured out that when they merge all of our cultures, that none of us have any culture and none of us have any history?
[01:10:56.829 --> 01:11:05.271]  And understand, folks, I'm not here saying that, you know, if a white person and a Hispanic love each other, or black and white, whatever, don't get married, don't have children.
[01:11:05.491 --> 01:11:07.031]  My point is, is it's being driven.
[01:11:07.311 --> 01:11:08.111]  It's being pushed.
[01:11:08.151 --> 01:11:10.312]  It's being crammed down throats.
[01:11:10.412 --> 01:11:12.772]  It's being, you know, in overdrive.
[01:11:13.985 --> 01:11:16.326]  Literally, I call up people and go, what's your parade about?
[01:11:16.506 --> 01:11:17.487]  Hey, you're white, aren't you?
[01:11:17.667 --> 01:11:19.007]  There won't be white people soon.
[01:11:19.027 --> 01:11:20.488]  We're gonna get your women.
[01:11:20.508 --> 01:11:21.488]  Ha ha ha ha!
[01:11:21.708 --> 01:11:23.509]  Literally, I'm on the phone going, what?
[01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:29.572]  And so there's this frothing, frothing move.
[01:11:29.632 --> 01:11:30.352]  And it's the same thing.
[01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:36.535]  It's like the Chinese and the Tibetans, or what happened to the Greeks, or what happened to the Egyptians, what happened to any of these groups.
[01:11:38.576 --> 01:11:39.376]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:11:40.557 --> 01:11:41.177]  I'm tired of it.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.641]  Because I want everybody to live in peace.
[01:11:43.921 --> 01:11:45.362]  And I know what the plan is.
[01:11:45.402 --> 01:11:46.963]  They want to give us the Hollywood culture.
[01:11:47.343 --> 01:11:48.304]  The fad culture.
[01:11:48.784 --> 01:11:52.627]  To not know who our grandpa was, and who his grandpa was, and who grandma was.
[01:11:52.687 --> 01:11:54.368]  And to not know where we come from.
[01:11:54.428 --> 01:11:56.309]  And that all our cultures are bad.
[01:11:56.849 --> 01:11:58.911]  Especially any type of European culture.
[01:11:58.931 --> 01:12:03.274]  I mean, there's even been calls to not let people have Oktoberfest.
[01:12:03.294 --> 01:12:06.976]  Or, you know, any type of Polish or German or Czech festivals.
[01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:08.517]  Oh, that's really racism.
[01:12:10.385 --> 01:12:11.065]  I'm tired of it!
[01:12:11.165 --> 01:12:12.566]  I haven't done anything to you!
[01:12:13.666 --> 01:12:14.626]  I'm not your enemy!
[01:12:15.126 --> 01:12:29.850]  And I'm not going to stoop down now to your level and go join the Aryan Nations just because a sizable group of Hispanics and Blacks hate white people's guts, and when they get a flat tire, or they get a bill in the mail, or when something doesn't go right, why, it's a white man's fault!
[01:12:32.991 --> 01:12:34.992]  White people are a tiny group, 6%.
[01:12:35.272 --> 01:12:38.853]  The media will tell you 8% is really 6% of world population.
[01:12:39.714 --> 01:12:41.295]  And whites will not exist.
[01:12:41.335 --> 01:12:45.796]  There may just be a few hundred thousand whites in about 60-70 years.
[01:12:47.037 --> 01:12:49.498]  Literally, people that are what you'd call, you know, pure whites.
[01:12:52.178 --> 01:12:59.081]  And everybody else's culture has to be celebrated and loved and worshipped, but I'm sick of hearing how, I gotta lay down and die!
[01:13:00.504 --> 01:13:03.105]  I've got to lay down and die because you're the God people.
[01:13:03.406 --> 01:13:07.228]  The Hispanics in the metric group say they're the cosmic God race.
[01:13:07.268 --> 01:13:14.432]  I've got the mayor doing a proclamation, Gus Garcia, three years ago, before Will Wins slithered in, saying we're the supreme God race.
[01:13:14.472 --> 01:13:15.232]  And I've got it on video.
[01:13:15.272 --> 01:13:15.932]  Put it on TV.
[01:13:16.533 --> 01:13:17.133]  City Council.
[01:13:17.173 --> 01:13:17.913]  They had it on TV.
[01:13:18.954 --> 01:13:28.479]  I've got to hear the blacks say you're the God race, and Louis Farrakhan say it, and where you got it from the flying saucer man gave it to you, and the Aztecs say it's a magic pyramid.
[01:13:28.499 --> 01:13:29.940]  It's the same garbage.
[01:13:30.763 --> 01:13:33.565]  The Nazis said they were a god race, a supreme race.
[01:13:34.946 --> 01:13:37.128]  It's just over and over and over again.
[01:13:38.008 --> 01:13:39.970]  The Japanese said they were the supreme race.
[01:13:40.330 --> 01:13:41.091]  I'm sick of it!
[01:13:41.311 --> 01:13:45.574]  The New World Order sits here and pulls our strings and manipulates us.
[01:13:48.476 --> 01:13:50.657]  That professor sits up there and says they're putting our kids on Ritalin.
[01:13:50.877 --> 01:13:51.758]  Hey, you seen the numbers?
[01:13:51.838 --> 01:13:56.441]  White kids are the biggest group on Ritalin and Prozac and amphetamine and psychotropics.
[01:13:57.202 --> 01:13:58.543]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[01:14:01.553 --> 01:14:02.894]  You don't know what you're talking about.
[01:14:04.916 --> 01:14:15.246]  And so, for anybody out there, any black people out there listening who are clapping, you know, just like the people in that audience were clapping on C-SPAN for this black professor, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[01:14:16.568 --> 01:14:18.790]  You ought to, but see, you feel all self-righteous in it.
[01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:23.014]  Don't you know that some white supremacist leader who writes books about killing you,
[01:14:23.931 --> 01:14:27.595]  Well, if they did, they'd be arrested, but don't you know that they feel self-righteous?
[01:14:27.815 --> 01:14:30.277]  Don't you know they're spouting the exact same stuff?
[01:14:30.518 --> 01:14:33.521]  They just changed the name from black to white?
[01:14:33.941 --> 01:14:35.322]  Don't you know what you're doing?
[01:14:35.623 --> 01:14:37.284]  So don't sit there all self-righteous!
[01:14:37.304 --> 01:14:40.688]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:14:40.748 --> 01:14:41.549]  I said I'd take calls.
[01:14:41.929 --> 01:14:42.790]  Allison, Arkansas.
[01:14:42.830 --> 01:14:43.170]  Go ahead.
[01:14:43.190 --> 01:14:43.731]  Thanks for holding.
[01:14:44.355 --> 01:14:50.358]  Well Alex, I took off work today to bring you this because I think it's very urgent and I would like to run this by you.
[01:14:50.378 --> 01:14:51.479]  Oh boy, let me hear!
[01:14:52.439 --> 01:14:53.099]  It's two parts.
[01:14:53.179 --> 01:14:56.201]  It's concerning Juan Carlos and then it's concerning President Bush.
[01:14:57.121 --> 01:14:58.302]  This can all be verified.
[01:14:58.322 --> 01:15:07.546]  I lived in Colorado back in about 2002 and I had a copy of the Jerusalem Post so you can probably get a copy of this to verify this.
[01:15:08.187 --> 01:15:10.728]  Juan Carlos was shown in the Jerusalem Post
[01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:29.360]  And at his coronation, for generations and generations and generations, they were offered the title King of Jerusalem, and all of the generations refused their title to take that.
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.901]  They said, no, no, no.
[01:15:31.381 --> 01:15:33.162]  This is for one that comes after us.
[01:15:33.202 --> 01:15:36.925]  And so they kept turning it down, turning it down, turning it down, and at his coronation,
[01:15:37.443 --> 01:15:43.126]  He took the title King of Jerusalem and again was proclaimed in the Jerusalem Post being King of Kings.
[01:15:43.666 --> 01:15:45.147]  And so you can get a copy of that.
[01:15:45.487 --> 01:15:53.851]  But it's also important to know that over in Colorado, which can also be verified, we have two huge land grants.
[01:15:53.951 --> 01:16:00.995]  One is the San De Cristo Land Grant, which is 100,000 acres, and that's just south of Rosenberg.
[01:16:01.568 --> 01:16:12.139]  And then the other land grant is almost the exact same size, and that's buttoned up against the sand dunes, which is called the Luis Maria Baca Land Grant.
[01:16:12.179 --> 01:16:14.841]  Those land grants were also given to Spain.
[01:16:14.921 --> 01:16:21.848]  So we've got 200,000 acres of the state of Colorado that was just given as a land grant to Spain.
[01:16:21.948 --> 01:16:23.190]  And right in the middle of that,
[01:16:23.982 --> 01:16:45.398]  Right between those two huge land grants, out in Huaceno County, which you can easily verify, and I've already verified when I lived there, with the Register of Deeds, the prince of Juan Carlos' son has brought up thousands and thousands of acres as well, even took the county roads and he's building a compound there.
[01:16:46.619 --> 01:16:47.740]  For those that don't know,
[01:16:50.094 --> 01:16:56.057]  Juan Carlos is hooked into the Spanish company that's going to put the toll roads and transponders on all the major Texas roads.
[01:16:56.117 --> 01:16:59.479]  I mean... Yes, I wanted to bring that in, but let me finish because this is two parts.
[01:16:59.539 --> 01:17:03.361]  It's very, very important and I'm losing a lot of money today to bring this to you.
[01:17:03.901 --> 01:17:06.663]  Okay, so those toll roads also is a bus route, by the way.
[01:17:07.523 --> 01:17:19.550]  If I was going to go to Walsenburg from Arkansas here, I would go through that Texas toll road there up into that very area of Walsenburg to be let off and that would have been
[01:17:20.374 --> 01:17:28.358]  Right where all those land grants have been given to Spain, and where the Prince of Spain has bought also huge thousands and thousands of acres.
[01:17:28.378 --> 01:17:33.700]  And this is important when you consider that President Bush, I want to bring this in because this is Bible Prophecy.
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:34.841]  Okay, you can bring it in, go ahead.
[01:17:35.141 --> 01:17:47.206]  Okay, Bible Prophecy says, and I got this from your show because I listen all the time, that Seleucia was the first that I heard of the fourth
[01:17:47.814 --> 01:17:55.337]  National ID card, which I consider the mark because it numbers the man and it puts you into the world's biggest tracking device.
[01:17:55.497 --> 01:17:57.617]  People in Fallujah were given a choice.
[01:17:57.997 --> 01:18:00.918]  You will take this into your hand or be put to death.
[01:18:00.978 --> 01:18:04.440]  So I consider that technically forbidden in my religion.
[01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:07.801]  And the National ID card is off limits to me.
[01:18:07.901 --> 01:18:11.922]  So they were offered... That was on NBC News, Tom Brokaw, before he retired.
[01:18:12.002 --> 01:18:12.662]  I have it on tape.
[01:18:13.182 --> 01:18:14.783]  They said if you do not take
[01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:17.630]  Uh, the card, you are killed.
[01:18:18.191 --> 01:18:19.031]  Oh, now we know?
[01:18:19.431 --> 01:18:20.111]  Oh, no.
[01:18:20.251 --> 01:18:21.031]  Are you going to break?
[01:18:21.251 --> 01:18:24.152]  Yeah, listen, I don't want you to ever take off work again, okay?
[01:18:24.172 --> 01:18:29.233]  I appreciate your call, but we can't be responsible for people taking off work to be able to call into the show.
[01:18:29.673 --> 01:18:30.733]  But I appreciate your call.
[01:18:30.773 --> 01:18:33.194]  That's, uh, very important information, Alice.
[01:18:33.634 --> 01:18:37.034]  We gotta come back and get to Jesse, Eric, Emmett, Phillip, and others.
[01:18:37.875 --> 01:18:37.975]  Okay?
[01:18:37.995 --> 01:18:39.535]  Because I can't be responsible.
[01:18:39.975 --> 01:18:41.075]  Kinda got put on the spot there.
[01:18:41.475 --> 01:18:43.396]  I'm costing you a lot of money, so please don't do that again.
[01:18:43.416 --> 01:18:44.176]  But thank you.
[01:18:46.972 --> 01:18:47.773]  Attention Drivers!
[01:18:48.073 --> 01:18:50.614]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[01:18:50.915 --> 01:18:54.217]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[01:18:54.537 --> 01:18:59.400]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents and fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:03.423]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[01:19:03.843 --> 01:19:04.904]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[01:19:05.204 --> 01:19:08.205]  Poor mileage and reduced performance in a time of record fuel prices.
[01:19:08.525 --> 01:19:09.165]  There is an answer.
[01:19:09.445 --> 01:19:15.568]  Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.
[01:19:15.828 --> 01:19:22.891]  Plus, a special mileage improver designed and fleet tested by a major oil company to improve mileage even on new cars by up to 4%.
[01:19:23.231 --> 01:19:25.472]  The mileage improvement lasts for an entire oil change.
[01:19:25.752 --> 01:19:29.714]  So quit wasting unburned fuel and get more when you treat your car right with Protecta.

[01:19:46.869 --> 01:19:48.470]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.

[01:20:46.866 --> 01:20:47.306]  Gold.
[01:20:47.646 --> 01:20:48.947]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:20:49.187 --> 01:20:55.289]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:20:55.469 --> 01:20:59.290]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:20:59.650 --> 01:21:01.531]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:01.571 --> 01:21:03.872]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:04.012 --> 01:21:11.314]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:21:11.434 --> 01:21:12.515]  We're good to go.
[01:21:27.985 --> 01:21:32.509]  Call 800-686-2237 for the report of Fed hopes you'll never see.

[01:21:47.742 --> 01:21:49.323]  Government of death which governs me.
[01:21:49.904 --> 01:21:51.204]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:21:51.645 --> 01:21:54.346]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:21:54.807 --> 01:21:57.449]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:21:57.889 --> 01:22:04.353]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:22:04.673 --> 01:22:12.479]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers from humorous to serious at LibertyStickers.com.
[01:22:12.759 --> 01:22:16.281]  LibertyStickers.com can even customize your own bumper stickers.
[01:22:16.441 --> 01:22:17.522]  It's time to stand up.
[01:22:17.602 --> 01:22:18.362]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[01:22:18.382 --> 01:22:18.902]  Have you?
[01:22:18.942 --> 01:22:20.123]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[01:22:20.143 --> 01:22:21.623]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[01:22:21.643 --> 01:22:22.163]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:22:22.183 --> 01:22:22.864]  Osama Bin Forgotten.
[01:22:55.883 --> 01:23:02.890]  We railed against the crown.
[01:23:03.931 --> 01:23:07.074]  I am aware of the big compounds that the Royals have built in the U.S.
[01:23:07.134 --> 01:23:07.555]  and Canada.
[01:23:07.595 --> 01:23:09.036]  I'm aware of how much land they own.
[01:23:09.056 --> 01:23:17.064]  A bit of England owns a substantive part of Canada, a large portion of the country, large portions of Australia.
[01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:22.132]  She owns much of the city of London itself, and much of the country of England.
[01:23:22.192 --> 01:23:23.453]  Oh, but she doesn't have any power.
[01:23:23.993 --> 01:23:28.136]  I heard it on the news, and Juan Carlos will be taxing me to drive down the road here very soon.
[01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:29.937]  But so what?
[01:23:29.957 --> 01:23:31.498]  You know, royalty needs to do that.
[01:23:32.439 --> 01:23:35.661]  Let's go ahead and talk to Eric, then Emmett, then Phillip, then Omar, and others.
[01:23:35.701 --> 01:23:36.342]  Go ahead, Eric.
[01:23:36.362 --> 01:23:36.942]  You're on the air.
[01:23:36.962 --> 01:23:38.483]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:23:39.063 --> 01:23:39.644]  Good, my friend.
[01:23:39.949 --> 01:23:40.229]  Good.
[01:23:40.489 --> 01:23:48.854]  I don't mean to get off topic, but I was wondering if maybe you could take a few moments and maybe talk about Lyndon LaRouche and his organization.
[01:23:48.874 --> 01:23:50.355]  I get calls all the time.
[01:23:51.936 --> 01:23:54.477]  You ask me what I think of Lyndon LaRouche, and I'll tell you right now.
[01:23:55.378 --> 01:23:56.598]  He talks about the elite.
[01:23:56.618 --> 01:23:58.079]  He talks about the European royalty.
[01:23:58.099 --> 01:23:59.180]  He talks about the big banks.
[01:23:59.200 --> 01:24:00.861]  He talks about how they're scamming us.
[01:24:01.761 --> 01:24:04.183]  But then he gives solutions that I don't agree with.
[01:24:04.263 --> 01:24:04.843]  Big government
[01:24:05.653 --> 01:24:11.015]  Internationalist solution so it's really a false solution and that's what I think of LaRouche.
[01:24:12.935 --> 01:24:13.415]  That's good.
[01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:15.136]  Thanks, I was just wondering.
[01:24:15.836 --> 01:24:17.837]  What do you think of LaRouche?
[01:24:18.257 --> 01:24:31.401]  Well, around the last election I had heard some of his people on rent and I had called to get some of their literature so I could kind of do some of my own research and they had
[01:24:31.912 --> 01:24:36.635]  Kind of been harassing me almost since then to send in financial support.
[01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:43.159]  That was my, I've got to be honest with you, that's the experience I had about 12 years ago.
[01:24:43.239 --> 01:24:51.564]  I just sent off, they said call and get one of these free magazines and then they did call us quite a bit.
[01:24:51.584 --> 01:24:52.324]  Thanks for the call.
[01:24:52.804 --> 01:24:57.047]  Yeah, no, it's, I'm not, I'm sorry, I'm not a fan of the LaRouche crowd.
[01:24:58.556 --> 01:24:58.836]  Yes, Alex.
[01:25:24.463 --> 01:25:29.546]  Every time I get my driver's license out, which has my picture on, I see Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:25:30.586 --> 01:25:32.847]  I'm balding and I can stand in for the man.
[01:25:35.588 --> 01:25:37.770]  Hey, don't fall into the black's trap.
[01:25:38.230 --> 01:25:41.171]  You said a statement that you have many black friends.
[01:25:41.571 --> 01:25:44.713]  They look at that as being a bigot talking.
[01:25:45.893 --> 01:25:46.314]  Oh, I know.
[01:25:46.454 --> 01:25:51.356]  Well, that's because the media has taught them that all basic communication is a racist code.
[01:25:53.783 --> 01:26:06.655]  And so saying, yeah, oh, I have black friends, just saying people are black, all these groups are supposed to identify racially, but then we, the subhumans, are not even allowed to address them in their racial connotation.
[01:26:06.955 --> 01:26:09.478]  Now, what my call is and my piece is,
[01:26:10.236 --> 01:26:12.797]  They say Saudi Arabia is drowning in oil.
[01:26:12.817 --> 01:26:17.479]  Some of our refineries in Kansas, Texas and all are shut down.
[01:26:17.979 --> 01:26:18.800]  What are they doing?
[01:26:18.820 --> 01:26:22.221]  Are they trying to limit our travel so we're close to home?
[01:26:22.241 --> 01:26:24.042]  Well, there's no debate.
[01:26:24.282 --> 01:26:33.286]  We have about 50 plus different memos from three major oil companies since 1996 where they bought up and shut down refineries and have reduced their own
[01:26:34.027 --> 01:26:40.375]  Because they said there's too much oil, there's an overabundance, we've got to covertly shut down refineries, but then gouge people.
[01:26:40.855 --> 01:26:47.844]  And it's public, and there'll be no Justice Department indictments, nothing's going to happen, we have them red-handed, and the raping will continue.
[01:26:48.025 --> 01:26:51.970]  Is that to keep us close to home in case when the crash happens?
[01:26:54.230 --> 01:26:55.590]  Economy goes kablam?
[01:26:55.871 --> 01:26:57.491]  It's just a basic raping.
[01:26:58.071 --> 01:26:58.271]  Oh, okay.
[01:26:58.291 --> 01:27:01.732]  But according to this black professor, it's only blacks being financially raped.
[01:27:01.792 --> 01:27:04.093]  I thought I was being raped, too.
[01:27:04.673 --> 01:27:05.173]  Okay.
[01:27:05.193 --> 01:27:07.174]  A Pennsylvania Dutchman.
[01:27:07.654 --> 01:27:11.515]  Yeah, well, listen, Emmett, let's not fall into the trap, though, of saying that
[01:27:12.155 --> 01:27:16.678]  All black Americans are hyper-sensitive and think all the whites are out to get them.
[01:27:16.978 --> 01:27:21.901]  You know, a lot of the blacks I know are just hard-working, smart folks who care less and have got their heads screwed on.
[01:27:21.921 --> 01:27:27.224]  But the media and the culture is there to try to turn us all against each other, and I'm not buying into it.
[01:27:27.244 --> 01:27:30.526]  But what do you think of that professor saying, you and I need to lay down and die?
[01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:31.867]  Oh, my.
[01:27:32.287 --> 01:27:36.169]  That's as bad as Hitler at the Jews.
[01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:39.351]  But I want to know why the civil rights groups who defend that type of talk.
[01:27:40.572 --> 01:27:40.852]  Yeah.
[01:27:42.859 --> 01:27:43.160]  Awful.
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:45.321]  Thanks for the call.
[01:27:45.921 --> 01:27:46.262]  You bet.
[01:27:46.462 --> 01:27:47.742]  And of course, it'll never work.
[01:27:49.604 --> 01:27:50.964]  It'll never... I mean, can you imagine?
[01:27:50.984 --> 01:27:52.966]  I mean, this guy's on TV!
[01:27:53.006 --> 01:27:55.767]  We need to start killing all the whites immediately!
[01:27:55.787 --> 01:27:59.670]  Well, that's what Charlie Manson said.
[01:27:59.710 --> 01:28:10.036]  He said, the blacks are gonna kill all of us, and so we gotta start... we gotta start killing whites to then blame it on, uh, the, uh, the blacks to start the race war.
[01:28:11.022 --> 01:28:13.523]  So you're right there in bed with Charlie Manson, Bubba!
[01:28:15.263 --> 01:28:18.544]  You think I'm gonna run around all guilty and be afraid to speak out against you?
[01:28:19.305 --> 01:28:20.345]  It's not gonna happen, folks.
[01:28:20.385 --> 01:28:20.905]  And you know what?
[01:28:22.045 --> 01:28:23.586]  We got people across the board.
[01:28:23.626 --> 01:28:24.826]  I don't care if you're polka-dotted.
[01:28:25.566 --> 01:28:27.367]  We got people waking up and getting involved.
[01:28:27.587 --> 01:28:32.509]  And they know the enemy is Queen Elizabeth, Juan Carlos, Rockefellers and the Rothschilds.
[01:28:32.869 --> 01:28:34.249]  Get in your white neighbor.
[01:28:34.289 --> 01:28:34.969]  Give me a break.
[01:28:37.590 --> 01:28:38.510]  We're on the march.
[01:28:38.970 --> 01:28:40.471]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:41.491 --> 01:28:44.233]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:47.015 --> 01:28:48.976]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[01:28:49.036 --> 01:28:51.938]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:57.501]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there is someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[01:28:57.741 --> 01:28:59.262]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:28:59.302 --> 01:29:01.544]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:29:01.724 --> 01:29:05.286]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:29:05.606 --> 01:29:07.627]  And they can do it without due process.
[01:29:07.707 --> 01:29:11.148]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries.
[01:29:11.288 --> 01:29:14.629]  And now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[01:29:14.809 --> 01:29:20.511]  Wealth-hiding secrets of the elite are exposed in this best-selling book, Bulletproof Asset Protection.
[01:29:20.791 --> 01:29:28.214]  Find out how you can make it look like you have no equity in your property or make it look like you own no property and a whole lot more.
[01:29:28.294 --> 01:29:28.634]  We're good.
[01:29:47.583 --> 01:29:49.204]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:49.324 --> 01:29:53.446]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:53.566 --> 01:29:56.448]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:29:56.528 --> 01:30:03.252]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:03.432 --> 01:30:06.433]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:06.633 --> 01:30:09.035]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:09.155 --> 01:30:11.476]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria,
[01:30:11.476 --> 01:30:12.016]  We're good to go!
[01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:53.876]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:30:54.196 --> 01:30:59.480]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.862]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[01:31:51.306 --> 01:31:52.867]  This show is documented.
[01:31:53.347 --> 01:31:56.130]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:31:56.510 --> 01:32:00.033]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:32:00.473 --> 01:32:02.414]  I went down, down, down.
[01:32:02.775 --> 01:32:05.937]  I'm going to show Omar Rodney and others here in a moment.
[01:32:05.997 --> 01:32:06.958]  Wide open phones today.
[01:32:06.978 --> 01:32:07.038]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:07.058 --> 01:32:09.000]  1-800-259-9231 will get you up and on the air.
[01:32:21.155 --> 01:32:26.419]  But let me be clear about the New World Order.
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:30.182]  It's called Divide and Conquer.
[01:32:31.984 --> 01:32:34.006]  It's just like what they pull in Serbia.
[01:32:34.086 --> 01:32:35.547]  It's just like what they pull in Africa.
[01:32:35.587 --> 01:32:38.009]  They'll play one tribe off against another.
[01:32:39.050 --> 01:32:42.252]  They'll play Catholic off against Protestant in Northern Ireland.
[01:32:42.813 --> 01:32:44.334]  They'll play rich off against poor.
[01:32:44.454 --> 01:32:46.416]  Feminism, woman against man.
[01:32:47.771 --> 01:32:51.052]  And it's not so the woman's going to be free and get more opportunities.
[01:32:51.112 --> 01:33:01.035]  It's so, the government's own documents show, they can get everybody taxed, everybody into the system working as slaves, so the children don't have parents, so the state can raise the child.
[01:33:01.695 --> 01:33:03.396]  And you know, this professor's right.
[01:33:04.056 --> 01:33:05.776]  See, 80% of what he's saying is true. 90%.
[01:33:08.490 --> 01:33:09.670]  They want to break up the family.
[01:33:09.691 --> 01:33:10.531]  They want to drug us.
[01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:11.431]  They want to control us.
[01:33:11.471 --> 01:33:14.552]  The whole world is being made into a giant plantation.
[01:33:14.572 --> 01:33:17.273]  I have a website called PrisonPlanet.com, folks.
[01:33:17.493 --> 01:33:21.935]  The Prison Planet is what's being built.
[01:33:24.576 --> 01:33:25.997]  But it's for everybody.
[01:33:26.057 --> 01:33:32.259]  And then inside that Prison Planet, because there's only a few thousand elite, they're going to endlessly play us off against each other.
[01:33:32.739 --> 01:33:35.280]  And then they're going to win unless we get past this.
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:37.261]  Unless we have an Enlightenment.
[01:33:38.883 --> 01:33:39.904]  But it feels good.
[01:33:39.944 --> 01:33:41.285]  It's tribal, folks.
[01:33:41.986 --> 01:33:45.709]  It's built into us and our development to hate the people over the next hill.
[01:33:46.530 --> 01:33:48.071]  Because we had to compete with them.
[01:33:48.091 --> 01:33:52.355]  Didn't matter if their genetics were identical to ours over the next hill.
[01:33:52.755 --> 01:33:54.237]  Whether they were black or white or whatever.
[01:33:54.617 --> 01:34:01.203]  In ancient Africa or ancient Europe, we had to compete with them for caribou, and for water, and for everything.
[01:34:04.111 --> 01:34:10.576]  And so we started raiding each other and fighting with each other and taking each other's women to make our tribe bigger to beat them next time.
[01:34:11.016 --> 01:34:12.197]  The Native Americans did that.
[01:34:12.377 --> 01:34:25.147]  That's why, that's why the evil Whitey, who was just another tribal creature, could come in and defeat the Native Americans even though they outnumbered the Whites ten to one for the first hundred years of the conquest.
[01:34:25.467 --> 01:34:26.087]  Why was that?
[01:34:26.147 --> 01:34:30.971]  Not just disease, because you could go up to the Indian tribe, the Native tribe, and pay them off to go kill the next tribe.
[01:34:31.531 --> 01:34:42.496]  You'd go to the tribe that was enemies with the other tribe, you'd team up, knock out that tribe, then you'd play the other tribe off against the tribe you just worked with, and then you'd just keep dominoing, dominoing right on to the next one.
[01:34:43.196 --> 01:34:45.757]  You don't think African warlords didn't do that with blacks?
[01:34:47.118 --> 01:34:48.238]  White people didn't invent this.
[01:34:48.298 --> 01:34:49.619]  Human beings have always done this.
[01:34:49.879 --> 01:34:51.619]  It's called chess, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:53.980]  And I'm not going to sit here.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:35:00.203]  I'm not going to go join the white supremacists because so many blacks and Hispanics are openly saying they want to kill all whites.
[01:35:01.846 --> 01:35:02.246]  Literally.
[01:35:02.327 --> 01:35:02.947]  It's horrible.
[01:35:03.868 --> 01:35:09.533]  And just because there's some white racists who don't like blacks, you shouldn't think we're all creeping around.
[01:35:09.754 --> 01:35:12.456]  You really think your neighbor's creeping around hating you because you're black?
[01:35:13.617 --> 01:35:15.659]  But see, this creates distrust.
[01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:17.321]  This creates division.
[01:35:17.721 --> 01:35:19.503]  This creates people not getting along.
[01:35:21.805 --> 01:35:23.007]  We're talking about bird flu.
[01:35:23.027 --> 01:35:26.410]  More and more scientists and top doctors saying it's all a big hoax, a big fraud.
[01:35:27.219 --> 01:35:32.721]  We're talking about whatever you want to discuss, but we have gotten into this professor, Dr. Cam Bon.
[01:35:33.701 --> 01:35:36.122]  I mentioned him a few weeks ago, but I thought I'd play the clip today.
[01:35:36.662 --> 01:35:39.623]  Let's go ahead and talk to Phillip in South Carolina.
[01:35:39.663 --> 01:35:40.203]  Phillip, go ahead.
[01:35:41.463 --> 01:35:42.483]  Alex, a big fan.
[01:35:42.883 --> 01:35:44.604]  Called in, I guess, once a few months ago.
[01:35:45.537 --> 01:35:46.318]  Uh, just a couple of things.
[01:35:46.398 --> 01:35:50.241]  I was just curious what other films you have that you're working on right at the moment.
[01:35:50.642 --> 01:35:53.965]  And I'm also, I mean, I've done a lot of reading and research myself.
[01:35:54.085 --> 01:35:58.348]  I'm nowhere near your level, but I can compete with anybody I see on the street.
[01:35:58.509 --> 01:36:00.430]  Well, I'm sure you are above my level.
[01:36:00.490 --> 01:36:01.191]  I'm not that smart.
[01:36:02.172 --> 01:36:03.313]  Well, I know it takes a while.
[01:36:03.393 --> 01:36:04.633]  As far as research, you've done a lot.
[01:36:04.653 --> 01:36:06.314]  You've been doing it for a lot longer than I have.
[01:36:06.334 --> 01:36:13.357]  But I have read a lot of books, seen a lot of documentaries, and I just think about it all the time because it's very, very important.
[01:36:13.457 --> 01:36:15.538]  Well, how could you not think about it all the time?
[01:36:16.999 --> 01:36:23.142]  Whether you're black or white, they're going to start forcing vaccines on us that actually reduce our IQs.
[01:36:23.968 --> 01:36:25.229]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[01:36:25.449 --> 01:36:27.110]  I try and wake up people all the time.
[01:36:27.130 --> 01:36:27.910]  I give them books.
[01:36:28.491 --> 01:36:30.352]  I'm like, read this or watch this.
[01:36:30.992 --> 01:36:35.354]  I've had one person actually read one of my books and the rest, they just keep it for two or three months.
[01:36:35.374 --> 01:36:36.735]  I'm like, give me back my book.
[01:36:37.115 --> 01:36:38.196]  But we can't give up.
[01:36:38.236 --> 01:36:39.136]  We've got to keep trying.
[01:36:40.397 --> 01:36:41.198]  I'll never give up.
[01:36:43.279 --> 01:36:46.741]  But like I said, I've always got ideas and I think your website is awesome.
[01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:47.201]  It's great.
[01:36:47.808 --> 01:36:51.850]  I'm all for message boards, but they turn into agent provocateur areas and they turn into nightmare situations in my experience.
[01:37:11.291 --> 01:37:24.749]  And then you know when people are on there slandering somebody and you go take down what they've said or they post somebody's home phone number and say harass them and then you go take that message down and then they go you're censoring me so I just don't have a message board.
[01:37:25.249 --> 01:37:30.233]  Because the censorship would be if I went to somebody else's message board and tried to get them to take it down.
[01:37:30.814 --> 01:37:33.296]  I just, if somebody sends me a good email, we'll post it.
[01:37:33.656 --> 01:37:36.078]  If somebody sends us a good article, they've written, I'll post it.
[01:37:36.518 --> 01:37:48.368]  But I, overall, I found message boards just turn into hives of disinformation and backstabbing and mindlessness and I really don't find them to be too productive overall.
[01:37:48.788 --> 01:37:53.212]  Because there's such anonymity to it that it's a perfect place for the enemy.
[01:37:57.529 --> 01:37:58.069]  Anything else?
[01:37:59.230 --> 01:38:02.872]  Uh, yeah, just curious what other films you're working on at the moment, what your plans are.
[01:38:02.952 --> 01:38:03.952]  I've got all your stuff.
[01:38:04.333 --> 01:38:06.414]  Well, let me answer that with you off air.
[01:38:06.454 --> 01:38:09.055]  I really appreciate you calling and holding, Phillip.
[01:38:09.095 --> 01:38:15.898]  I was going to plug this after Omar and Roddy because I don't want to make them hold, but I haven't plugged my videos yet today.
[01:38:15.918 --> 01:38:20.701]  We're an hour and 39 minutes into this transmission, so I guess I should do it or we won't be here.
[01:38:22.242 --> 01:38:24.803]  But my new film is The Order of Death.
[01:38:26.335 --> 01:38:47.931]  And it's about the death cults, the Germanic slash Canaanite to Semitic Arabic death cults that dominate our society and how it ties into Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, the new footage inside Bohemian Grove that one of the employees shot this year and last year.
[01:38:49.682 --> 01:38:54.725]  And it's a great film, 45 minutes long, really high production quality.
[01:38:55.165 --> 01:38:56.046]  I'm really proud of it.
[01:38:57.507 --> 01:39:03.050]  And then the second part is the cut down, remastered, re-edited, updated, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:39:03.090 --> 01:39:05.751]  Cut from over two hours down to an hour and a half now.
[01:39:06.172 --> 01:39:08.173]  So total, both films, two hours ten minutes.
[01:39:08.553 --> 01:39:09.453]  Not available yet.
[01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:11.995]  PrisonPlanet.tv members
[01:39:12.785 --> 01:39:14.726]  You can see the new Order of Death right now.
[01:39:14.766 --> 01:39:18.949]  We're about to upgrade because there was even another version I did that's the final version.
[01:39:19.309 --> 01:39:22.331]  That's not on PrisonPlanet.tv yet for members, but it will be by the end of the week.
[01:39:22.871 --> 01:39:30.476]  I'm also going to put the re-edited, remastered Bohemian Grove up on PrisonPlanet.tv here by Friday.
[01:39:31.017 --> 01:39:35.159]  It'll be up on PrisonPlanet.tv 15 cents a day for a membership there.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:37.981]  But that film isn't even available yet.
[01:39:38.481 --> 01:39:41.123]  Then in the next few months, it'll probably be out in mid-January.
[01:39:42.481 --> 01:39:46.322]  The late January, because I don't want to take my time, is going to be my trip to England.
[01:39:46.762 --> 01:39:48.443]  Also what happened in Crawford, Texas.
[01:39:48.963 --> 01:39:50.523]  And a bunch of other issues.
[01:39:50.583 --> 01:39:52.384]  The Katrina Hurricane.
[01:39:53.724 --> 01:39:54.704]  The Marshall Law.
[01:39:54.784 --> 01:39:56.405]  I haven't even figured out the name yet.
[01:39:56.425 --> 01:40:01.886]  I've got so much good stuff and I'm trying to figure out how to put it all together in one, say, 90 minute film.
[01:40:01.926 --> 01:40:03.347]  I'm going for shorter films.
[01:40:03.887 --> 01:40:04.967]  Not these, you know, epics.
[01:40:05.607 --> 01:40:08.088]  But speaking of epics, it's my best video I've ever made.
[01:40:08.128 --> 01:40:11.709]  It's Marshall Law, 9-11, rise of the police state.
[01:40:12.933 --> 01:40:15.356]  And it is my best video, heads above all the others.
[01:40:16.957 --> 01:40:18.018]  Heads and shoulders above them.
[01:40:18.639 --> 01:40:26.967]  It covers the police state, how the Globalists carried out 9-11, and then Part 3 is the Nazi death cult that controls it.
[01:40:29.409 --> 01:40:31.631]  The Nazi death cult that controls it.
[01:40:32.112 --> 01:40:34.234]  But you'll never hear that professor talking about that.
[01:40:35.712 --> 01:40:38.717]  And how that Nazi death cold is actually for killing most whites as well.
[01:40:39.238 --> 01:40:43.445]  You'll just hear him, probably even getting fun about the same people, out spouting, I wish you all had a race war.
[01:40:43.886 --> 01:40:45.769]  But, um, that's why I love it.
[01:40:45.809 --> 01:40:46.370]  I was looking at that...
[01:40:47.139 --> 01:40:50.461]  Wikipedia, Encyclopedia, and they've got on there some link.
[01:40:50.781 --> 01:40:57.224]  Well, people are challenging Jones because he criticizes Israel occasionally and is against the Federal Reserve for being anti-Semitic.
[01:40:57.644 --> 01:41:02.006]  And I don't have time to go to Wikipedia and get on there and say their thing.
[01:41:02.026 --> 01:41:02.427]  What do you mean?
[01:41:02.467 --> 01:41:05.188]  I made a film exposing Nazis, you buffoons!
[01:41:05.348 --> 01:41:06.629]  But it doesn't even matter anymore.
[01:41:06.649 --> 01:41:11.211]  It's just a label they throw on people because they don't have anything better to do.
[01:41:13.132 --> 01:41:37.198]  I mean, if I spend all day defending that I'm not a Nazi, or I spend all day defending that I'm not the head public relations person for Scientology, because there's a 50-something year old guy named Alex Jones, if I spend all day defending the fact that I'm not Alex S. Jones of the New York Times and NPR, some 65 year old guy, if I spend all day defending I'm not an industrial magnate named Alex Jones, who's 75 years old from Canada,
[01:41:38.263 --> 01:41:43.786]  Do I spend all day defending the fact that... I mean, just outright lies and garbage.
[01:41:43.826 --> 01:41:50.869]  I mean, I... Sometimes, whenever I'm tired and don't want to keep fighting, I'll turn on TV and look at all the propaganda and realize what we're facing.
[01:41:51.189 --> 01:41:53.571]  Or I'll type in bad things, you know, about myself.
[01:41:53.611 --> 01:41:54.971]  My name and bad things associated with it.
[01:41:55.191 --> 01:41:56.192]  Just look at what people say.
[01:41:56.492 --> 01:41:59.674]  Just the unbelievable lies and it energizes me.
[01:42:00.114 --> 01:42:01.435]  It actually gives me strength.
[01:42:02.395 --> 01:42:03.896]  Because that means I'm getting the job done.
[01:42:03.996 --> 01:42:05.136]  But I mean, it's incredible.
[01:42:05.597 --> 01:42:05.957]  Just the...
[01:42:07.060 --> 01:42:11.821]  Just the manifest... Now see, I was plugging videos, but now I'm not.
[01:42:13.041 --> 01:42:14.301]  I'm off in some rant.
[01:42:15.902 --> 01:42:23.083]  I'm off in some just, just, just... It's information overload is what it is, folks.
[01:42:23.523 --> 01:42:27.223]  Take a few calls, then I'm gonna get into the news for about 20-30 minutes, then we'll go back to calls.
[01:42:28.624 --> 01:42:34.345]  But before I do that, listen, if you believe in what we're doing, you need to get Road to Tyranny.
[01:42:34.745 --> 01:42:36.145]  You need to get martial law.
[01:42:36.849 --> 01:42:43.433]  You need to get my book, Descent into Tyranny, and Paul Watson's book, Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[01:42:46.254 --> 01:42:49.977]  You need to get these materials, and you need to get them out to people.
[01:42:50.977 --> 01:42:52.678]  And you need to make copies of them.
[01:42:55.340 --> 01:42:56.100]  It's that simple.
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:58.482]  It's so powerful when you do that.
[01:42:59.062 --> 01:43:04.325]  I want to commend all our listeners, whether you're Hispanic, or Black, or White, or Asian, or Martian.
[01:43:05.996 --> 01:43:07.076]  Thank you for getting the films.
[01:43:07.136 --> 01:43:08.557]  Thank you for supporting us.
[01:43:08.977 --> 01:43:13.059]  If you've got copies of the films and you liked them, you thought they were informative, please make copies.
[01:43:13.719 --> 01:43:17.100]  That's just as important as getting them if you haven't gotten them.
[01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:18.500]  Please get Martial Law.
[01:43:19.641 --> 01:43:21.081]  In fact, we got discounts right now.
[01:43:21.121 --> 01:43:22.222]  I haven't really talked about this.
[01:43:22.382 --> 01:43:26.903]  Three of my t-shirts for $30 for $9.95 apiece.
[01:43:27.724 --> 01:43:30.385]  These are made in America, folks, so they cost me $5 or $6 apiece.
[01:43:31.085 --> 01:43:34.246]  Like a small cost me $4.50, an extra large like $6 something.
[01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:37.891]  We're not even making money, I just want to get the t-shirts out.
[01:43:38.752 --> 01:43:42.654]  Three t-shirts, $9.95 a piece.
[01:43:43.334 --> 01:43:44.655]  Buy one for $15.
[01:43:46.496 --> 01:43:48.437]  You buy two, I think they're like $12 a piece.
[01:43:48.657 --> 01:43:49.778]  I forget, it's on my website.
[01:43:51.179 --> 01:43:55.961]  You can get Martial Law, three hours long, three films in one.
[01:43:56.842 --> 01:43:59.964]  Road to Tyranny, almost three hours long, only four films in one.
[01:44:01.144 --> 01:44:02.445]  An incredible film, Road to Tyranny.
[01:44:02.865 --> 01:44:04.186]  And then American Dictators.
[01:44:04.924 --> 01:44:10.009]  All three of those films on DVD for $44.95.
[01:44:10.529 --> 01:44:15.254]  I mean, that's like a, I don't know, three of them at regular price would be $75.
[01:44:15.394 --> 01:44:17.356]  It's like a $30 discount or something.
[01:44:17.716 --> 01:44:22.901]  I got a whole bunch of just out-of-control discounts up on the website, on everything.
[01:44:23.021 --> 01:44:24.422]  I just want to get this out to people.
[01:44:24.682 --> 01:44:25.303]  That's my goal.
[01:44:26.371 --> 01:44:27.412]  So please call toll free.
[01:44:27.452 --> 01:44:31.494]  You can ask about the specials and what titles there are and what those titles cover.

[01:44:32.154 --> 01:44:32.914]  Take that step.
[01:44:33.195 --> 01:44:38.978]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.

[01:45:28.966 --> 01:45:32.168]  We just, there's about, I don't know, there's like 10, 15, I haven't counted them up.
[01:45:32.188 --> 01:45:36.952]  There's a whole slew of specials that are only going until January 1st.
[01:45:38.133 --> 01:45:39.534]  And I want you to get them and give them as gifts.
[01:45:40.554 --> 01:45:44.317]  So InfoWars.com or don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[01:45:44.337 --> 01:45:48.000]  By the way, we're going to be upgrading servers later this week, so there might be
[01:45:48.746 --> 01:45:50.947]  Down for the first time for half a day or something.
[01:45:52.108 --> 01:45:55.750]  In the last year and a half of operations, we're really upgrading to a super jumbo system.
[01:45:56.690 --> 01:45:59.511]  Load, balance, multi, whatever you want to call it.
[01:46:00.272 --> 01:46:01.973]  Let's just say it's a humdinger, folks.
[01:46:02.033 --> 01:46:04.354]  It's a fancy fandango creature.
[01:46:05.314 --> 01:46:07.795]  But a newfangled device.
[01:46:08.716 --> 01:46:12.718]  But PrisonPlanet.tv, all my videos, my books on tape.
[01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:18.671]  There's a bunch of other films, my weekly TV reports, text reports.
[01:46:19.912 --> 01:46:20.653]  It's out of control.
[01:46:20.713 --> 01:46:21.834]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:46:22.154 --> 01:46:23.055]  Omar in Michigan.
[01:46:23.075 --> 01:46:24.076]  Thanks for holding Omar.
[01:46:24.796 --> 01:46:27.819]  Yeah, I'm a member of the God Race, the human race.
[01:46:28.919 --> 01:46:36.406]  And, you know, like this racial hoax thing they put out to advocate racial strife.
[01:46:37.486 --> 01:46:39.808]  People need to back up off of that.
[01:46:40.028 --> 01:46:42.971]  You know, you got to think for yourself, you know, because
[01:46:43.985 --> 01:46:48.847]  It's like, first off, black people are not even really a people, not in America.
[01:46:49.247 --> 01:46:51.648]  They've displaced Africans from everywhere.
[01:46:51.989 --> 01:46:53.789]  Do me a favor, will you speak up?
[01:46:54.290 --> 01:46:55.590]  Can you hear me now?
[01:46:56.090 --> 01:46:57.131]  Guys, can you boost Omar?
[01:46:57.151 --> 01:46:57.911]  He's just low to me.
[01:46:57.971 --> 01:46:58.572]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:46:59.532 --> 01:47:06.215]  Well, that's what I'm saying, you know, because black people are displaced Africans from everywhere.
[01:47:06.235 --> 01:47:07.756]  They're not a race.
[01:47:08.236 --> 01:47:10.077]  They're not a people.
[01:47:10.337 --> 01:47:12.818]  They have assimilated into America.
[01:47:14.042 --> 01:47:17.584]  Uh, and we practice a culture that's not our own.
[01:47:18.705 --> 01:47:34.816]  So, you know, and then for people to be advocating racial strife like this doctor talking about killing all white people and these Mexicans talk about killing all white people, then black people talk about killing Mexicans and white people.
[01:47:35.476 --> 01:47:36.017]  It's crazy!
[01:47:37.058 --> 01:47:38.879]  First off, we have one enemy.
[01:47:39.719 --> 01:47:42.101]  That is the globalist New World Order.
[01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:49.935]  And basically the United Nations and our whole government is doing all this stuff to us.
[01:47:50.595 --> 01:47:56.439]  And it's right there in front of your face and if you deny it, you're an idiot.
[01:47:56.519 --> 01:47:57.340]  That's my comment.
[01:47:58.160 --> 01:48:01.642]  Well, I agree with 90% of what he said.
[01:48:01.662 --> 01:48:07.526]  They're putting in stuff to control us, the world's a prison, they want to kill us, but they want to kill everybody!
[01:48:07.867 --> 01:48:08.367]  That's right.
[01:48:09.110 --> 01:48:11.972]  They want to kill us all, so it's us against them.
[01:48:12.012 --> 01:48:21.897]  And if we can't come together and figure out the problem and provide a solution to it, then we're just going to be dead or in concentration camps.
[01:48:21.937 --> 01:48:25.839]  Well, you're right.
[01:48:25.919 --> 01:48:29.001]  Listen, there's a reason that this guy is going to get in trouble for that.
[01:48:29.907 --> 01:48:32.188]  I mean, the government is funding this type of stuff.
[01:48:32.208 --> 01:48:33.889]  They want us in each other's throats.
[01:48:33.949 --> 01:48:34.450]  That's right.
[01:48:34.470 --> 01:48:40.073]  A lot of these black organizations are funded by the government or people that work for the government.
[01:48:40.133 --> 01:48:45.536]  They give them money and stuff like that because if they was, they'd be under my control.
[01:48:45.616 --> 01:48:47.798]  If they wasn't, they'd be under my control.
[01:48:48.878 --> 01:48:49.499]  But they're not.
[01:48:49.599 --> 01:48:51.100]  And they're not doing nothing to help
[01:48:52.595 --> 01:49:10.642]  uh... african-american listen i haven't but i think there's nothing wrong with with with black folks have on their own culture uh... but you know having a lot of pride there's nothing wrong with that the point is is that i is that is that this is being pushed this is being driven and very very dangerous
[01:49:11.462 --> 01:49:16.783]  And I really just can't stand these type of comments because it's going to create tension and we don't need that.
[01:49:16.843 --> 01:49:22.664]  We need to focus on people like Juan Carlos and I'm glad you agree and God bless you, Omar.
[01:49:24.164 --> 01:49:25.164]  Anything else you want to add?
[01:49:25.685 --> 01:49:29.365]  Uh, no, that's too much to cover in a couple of seconds.
[01:49:29.925 --> 01:49:30.525]  Well, no, you know what?
[01:49:30.565 --> 01:49:31.085]  You can stay there.
[01:49:31.105 --> 01:49:32.146]  If you've got more to add, that's fine.
[01:49:32.186 --> 01:49:33.186]  We'll go to Rodney in Texas.
[01:49:33.546 --> 01:49:34.366]  No, just regret.
[01:49:34.906 --> 01:49:35.626]  Have a nice day.
[01:49:35.746 --> 01:49:36.566]  Okay, thank you, sir.
[01:49:36.626 --> 01:49:37.727]  We'll come back and talk to Rodney.
[01:49:37.767 --> 01:49:38.707]  Good to hear from you, Omar.
[01:49:39.207 --> 01:49:40.247]  Look, I totally agree with him.
[01:49:40.839 --> 01:49:42.761]  Look, I don't care what color you are, folks.
[01:49:42.781 --> 01:49:45.223]  As long as you don't dislike me, I have nothing against you.
[01:49:48.365 --> 01:49:51.228]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:51.488 --> 01:49:52.168]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:52.268 --> 01:49:53.069]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:53.409 --> 01:49:58.093]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:49:58.413 --> 01:50:05.159]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:05.459 --> 01:50:07.460]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:07.660 --> 01:50:10.501]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:10.581 --> 01:50:15.242]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:15.462 --> 01:50:19.884]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:20.104 --> 01:50:27.286]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:27.567 --> 01:50:29.987]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:30.147 --> 01:50:31.888]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[01:50:32.469 --> 01:50:38.056]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:50:38.136 --> 01:50:45.046]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:50:47.663 --> 01:50:52.868]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[01:50:53.028 --> 01:51:01.116]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[01:51:01.376 --> 01:51:08.443]  Medical course potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[01:51:08.643 --> 01:51:09.884]  Radioactive poisoning.
[01:51:09.964 --> 01:51:15.848]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:16.048 --> 01:51:21.131]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:21.251 --> 01:51:30.137]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:30.397 --> 01:51:33.699]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[01:52:55.196 --> 01:53:05.083]  Julius Caesar, 2000 years ago, went into Germany, went into Gaul, which is France, and he wrote a book about it, how he could play off one tribe against the next, and like dominoes, move through them.
[01:53:06.944 --> 01:53:23.415]  I have a dream, folks, and it's that we're going to be on distant planets, a civilization that spans across the galaxy, that's God's plan for us, that we're going to have life extension technologies that the human species is going to develop, and that's God's plan.
[01:53:24.489 --> 01:53:25.090]  And you know what?
[01:53:26.630 --> 01:53:29.072]  I want humans to be able to do that.
[01:53:29.252 --> 01:53:42.699]  And as long as we are played with, as long as we're fools, as long as we fall into this primitive garbage, and that's what it is, that feels so good, we're not going anywhere.
[01:53:44.761 --> 01:53:45.681]  We're not going anywhere.
[01:53:47.202 --> 01:53:52.525]  So first and foremost, multiculturalism is a tool to destroy all of our cultures, number one.
[01:53:53.982 --> 01:53:54.823]  So that's a poison.
[01:53:55.623 --> 01:54:01.487]  Number two, all of this racial warfare strife stuff, that's another tool to turn the rest of us against each other.
[01:54:01.887 --> 01:54:03.108]  And it just isn't going to work, folks.
[01:54:03.148 --> 01:54:04.709]  We cannot put up with it.
[01:54:04.769 --> 01:54:06.330]  We cannot allow it.
[01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:22.601]  We cannot... It's like Malcolm X. When he found out that every white person wasn't a blue-eyed devil, because he went to Europe and Asia, when he found out that it was ridiculous, that's when the FBI gave a week and a nod
[01:54:23.453 --> 01:54:26.254]  to uh... a big black organization to kill him.
[01:54:27.114 --> 01:54:29.014]  See, that didn't play into the plan.
[01:54:30.615 --> 01:54:32.215]  And I won't be here forever, folks.
[01:54:32.415 --> 01:54:34.776]  And neither will you, but our great-grandchildren will.
[01:54:35.396 --> 01:54:36.796]  This needs to stop, folks.
[01:54:39.237 --> 01:54:40.497]  The left and the right are controlled.
[01:54:40.517 --> 01:54:43.518]  They're there to create more racial strife, not to fix it.
[01:54:44.438 --> 01:54:45.958]  Rodney in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:54:45.998 --> 01:54:46.358]  Go ahead.
[01:54:46.698 --> 01:54:48.859]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[01:54:49.239 --> 01:54:51.760]  I agree with what Omar was saying.
[01:54:51.800 --> 01:54:52.400]  Also,
[01:54:53.567 --> 01:55:14.069]  I want to preface what I'm about to say by saying that I'm like you, I agree with 90% of what this professor, doctor was saying, but it shows you just how dangerous, when you mix a little poison in with a lot of truth, how it can distort
[01:55:14.847 --> 01:55:18.168]  You know, the real fact that he mentioned.
[01:55:18.629 --> 01:55:20.409]  Well, it's like LaRouche.
[01:55:20.970 --> 01:55:24.471]  They tell you the problem, but then they give you a false solution.
[01:55:24.491 --> 01:55:24.731]  Right.
[01:55:25.291 --> 01:55:43.139]  Now, here's what I wanted to say, and this is something that I noticed, as you may have, Alex, that only a few weeks ago, you brought out this tape of Paul Harvey essentially saying the same thing that this
[01:55:43.959 --> 01:55:44.199]  I don't
[01:56:03.897 --> 01:56:07.039]  The many Africans and Native Americans.
[01:56:07.139 --> 01:56:10.020]  And see, suddenly it's okay for everybody to talk like this.
[01:56:10.060 --> 01:56:11.601]  That's because the elites flip a switch.
[01:56:12.141 --> 01:56:14.462]  And you're exactly right on point.
[01:56:14.522 --> 01:56:27.528]  You know, in the case of Malcolm X, when Malcolm X really seen through the facade, you know, of the globalists, the New World Order people, you know, he was no longer useful to them.
[01:56:28.266 --> 01:56:48.931]  And, now, the only minor thing that I disagree with you on is when you say, well, if this were a white person saying what, essentially, what this black professor said, they would probably be thrown in jail, but we know that's not truth because Paul Harvey is not generally known as a racist.
[01:56:49.131 --> 01:56:52.832]  Well, no, I know, but he couched it and talked about the past.
[01:56:53.650 --> 01:56:58.731]  He did say nuke the Arabs, but he didn't say let's go start killing all the blacks.
[01:56:59.252 --> 01:57:12.495]  But he said he didn't make any apologies for what was done and basically to me that implies, you know, whatever we do now is no problem with it.
[01:57:12.675 --> 01:57:15.656]  No Rodney, it's great points you make and I did
[01:57:16.437 --> 01:57:18.858]  As you know, decry Paul Harvey.
[01:57:18.898 --> 01:57:19.798]  I made a big deal out of it.
[01:57:19.818 --> 01:57:20.738]  We wrote articles about it.
[01:57:21.098 --> 01:57:22.419]  Is there anything else you want to add?
[01:57:22.659 --> 01:57:24.319]  No, I'm just saying that I think... Well, stay there.
[01:57:24.359 --> 01:57:25.459]  We've got to start the next hour.
[01:57:27.060 --> 01:57:31.641]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:43.363 --> 01:57:44.023]  Big Brother.
[01:57:44.684 --> 01:57:45.724]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:46.445 --> 01:57:47.545]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:48.226 --> 01:57:49.006]  You want answers?
[01:57:49.787 --> 01:57:50.667]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:51.347 --> 01:57:55.029]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:57:55.530 --> 01:57:59.632]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:57:59.832 --> 01:58:04.895]  I'm gonna take a few more calls and I'm gonna get back into the news.
[01:58:04.915 --> 01:58:08.137]  I believe there's a lot of it, but I played the clip that's been out for a few weeks of Dr.
[01:58:09.665 --> 01:58:18.192]  Cam Bon, the professor, the doctor, the activist, on C-SPAN saying the plan is kill every white person on earth.
[01:58:20.073 --> 01:58:21.734]  You know folks, I'm into justice.
[01:58:23.135 --> 01:58:24.837]  I'm into duty and honor.
[01:58:25.517 --> 01:58:28.019]  And into standing up for the weak and the downtrodden.
[01:58:28.059 --> 01:58:31.042]  I have an instinctive need to stand up against bullies.
[01:58:32.803 --> 01:58:36.306]  And it's hard to not sometimes try to paint with a broad brush and go,
[01:58:37.495 --> 01:58:39.075]  You know, Hispanics don't like me.
[01:58:39.435 --> 01:58:40.356]  Blacks don't like me.
[01:58:42.396 --> 01:58:48.837]  When you see the big groups that get the federal funding saying, kill all the whites, take over, whites are evil.
[01:58:50.798 --> 01:58:53.178]  And then you say, well, I'm your friend.
[01:58:53.218 --> 01:58:57.959]  I've got lots of friends that are, and they go, oh, that's code for racism, that you've got lots of Hispanic and black friends.
[01:58:57.979 --> 01:58:58.799]  Well, no, it's not.
[01:58:58.879 --> 01:59:02.380]  I'm saying those groups don't want to be friendly, folks.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:05.881]  It's like the Klan doesn't want to be friends with blacks, no matter what they try.
[01:59:07.276 --> 01:59:08.576]  And, uh, no matter what you do!
[01:59:10.377 --> 01:59:22.959]  And so I'm just disgusted by injustice in all this, and it's gotta stop, we gotta do something about it, and I mentioned the fact that when Malcolm X figured this out, that it was a facade, the FBI and a major black organization got together and killed him.
[01:59:23.319 --> 01:59:29.040]  You see, they both have the same thing, keeping the group separated, keeping people at each other's throats.
[01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:34.121]  Whether it's feminism or any of this stuff, it's all designed to break us up.
[01:59:35.503 --> 01:59:39.625]  Let's go back to... I'm talking about the brand of feminism the government pushes, folks.
[01:59:40.286 --> 01:59:41.927]  I don't mean women being slaves.
[01:59:41.947 --> 01:59:45.528]  That's not what... They equate feminism with that, and that's not what I'm talking about.
[01:59:47.750 --> 01:59:53.993]  Let's go ahead and go back to Rodney, and then later we'll get to Wyatt, Michael, Tim, Shannon, and others.
[01:59:55.273 --> 01:59:57.194]  Go ahead, Rodney, and finish up what you were saying.
[01:59:57.675 --> 02:00:03.278]  Well, it's really not... I don't really have much more to add other than I...
[02:00:04.674 --> 02:00:11.560]  I have seen many people who will, and I'll just go ahead and say it, they are racist.
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:20.927]  They will sit and listen to Edgar Steele and Gerard Taylor and David Dukes and they have no problems with them when they say the blacks are subhuman.
[02:00:20.967 --> 02:00:31.356]  But then you have this individual, this black doctor, who's obviously a racist too, what he said and the same people
[02:00:31.980 --> 02:00:39.363]  They want to barbecue this guy and say that, you see, he wants to kill white people.
[02:00:39.804 --> 02:00:41.064]  And I agree with you, Alex.
[02:00:41.164 --> 02:00:41.985]  It's dangerous.
[02:00:42.545 --> 02:00:46.607]  And I'm one who's for justice.
[02:00:47.447 --> 02:00:48.628]  And I'm like you.
[02:00:48.648 --> 02:00:53.950]  I have an instinctive need to stand up against people who are bullies and racist.
[02:00:54.470 --> 02:01:00.053]  But, you know, this is a very, very powerful tool of Satan, the devil.
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:07.484]  And I'm talking about Satan the Devil in the Bible, not the one that some people try to say is the white man.
[02:01:07.544 --> 02:01:17.870]  But nevertheless, you know, I have heard some individuals who shocked me when they said that they had no problems with what Paul Harvey said.
[02:01:17.890 --> 02:01:24.774]  You know, one morning I was listening to Dave Von Kleist and Joyce, and I loved their show, but I
[02:01:25.347 --> 02:01:30.072]  I was shocked to hear Dave von Kleist said he had no problems with what Paul Harvey said.
[02:01:30.512 --> 02:01:39.882]  He didn't see anything wrong with it, when in fact, like you, Alex, it's clear that it was very racial.
[02:01:43.226 --> 02:01:45.808]  I don't see how anybody could justify what Paul Harvey said.
[02:01:45.848 --> 02:01:47.610]  Are you sure he wasn't being sarcastic?
[02:01:48.678 --> 02:01:49.479]  No, no.
[02:01:49.759 --> 02:01:50.580]  He does that a lot.
[02:01:50.600 --> 02:01:53.362]  He does what I do.
[02:01:54.103 --> 02:02:07.054]  Look, I didn't call and ask him if he was being sarcastic, but I thought that I was understanding him pretty clearly.
[02:02:07.414 --> 02:02:11.137]  No, it was totally clear what Paul Harvey did, and I appreciate your call, Rodney.
[02:02:13.422 --> 02:02:14.483]  Just said, it's good.
[02:02:14.563 --> 02:02:15.844]  It justifies the means.
[02:02:15.864 --> 02:02:16.965]  Nuke all the Arabs.
[02:02:17.365 --> 02:02:19.127]  Kill all the Indians and smallpox.
[02:02:19.167 --> 02:02:19.887]  Buy 11s.
[02:02:20.187 --> 02:02:21.608]  Blacks being slaves is good.
[02:02:21.629 --> 02:02:27.353]  And, uh, I mean that... That kind of... That was amazing.
[02:02:28.094 --> 02:02:33.738]  And that's... Worse than what the black doctor said because so many more people heard it.
[02:02:33.778 --> 02:02:37.921]  I mean... Paul Harvey isn't, you know, just some little nobody professor.
[02:02:39.873 --> 02:02:42.797]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:02:43.498 --> 02:02:44.779]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:03:12.704 --> 02:03:15.886]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[02:03:15.926 --> 02:03:17.747]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:50.461]  So what do you do?

[02:05:30.274 --> 02:05:31.316]  Perhaps Jenna Bush?
[02:05:31.878 --> 02:05:33.060]  Osama Bin Forgotten?

[02:05:43.664 --> 02:05:47.947]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:49.348]  You want answers?
[02:05:50.088 --> 02:05:51.609]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:55.632]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.832 --> 02:05:59.975]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:00.695 --> 02:06:04.918]  Well, I didn't mean for it to get off into this, but it did.
[02:06:04.938 --> 02:06:12.143]  We spent the lion's share of this two-plus hour broadcast talking about
[02:06:15.712 --> 02:06:18.533]  Well, this black professor saying, kill every white.
[02:06:19.654 --> 02:06:21.494]  All whites must die, that's the problem.
[02:06:22.275 --> 02:06:23.595]  Which is just totally ridiculous.
[02:06:26.076 --> 02:06:31.178]  And Rodney just pointed out that Paul Harvey clip, in fact I forgot to ask you John, do you still have that in the computer?
[02:06:32.819 --> 02:06:43.563]  Well, Paul Harvey said, hey, we kill the Indians with bio-weapons, with smallpox blankets, we enslave the blacks, we ought to nuke the Arabs, this is how we keep America strong.
[02:06:44.164 --> 02:06:45.184]  Just insane!
[02:06:46.449 --> 02:06:55.893]  And really just said in a less, uh, well it was pretty blunt, but not quite as directly harsh, you know.
[02:06:56.393 --> 02:06:59.895]  He didn't say kill all blacks, but he just said basically injustifies the means.
[02:07:00.135 --> 02:07:00.955]  It's the same thing.
[02:07:01.095 --> 02:07:02.436]  Why is this acceptable?
[02:07:03.516 --> 02:07:05.837]  Because the elite wants us all to start thinking like this.
[02:07:05.857 --> 02:07:06.617]  See, it's very tribal.
[02:07:06.837 --> 02:07:08.018]  Let's kill all the Arabs.
[02:07:08.038 --> 02:07:09.738]  Well, we did it to the blacks and the Indians.
[02:07:10.059 --> 02:07:11.519]  Let's do it to the Arabs.
[02:07:12.079 --> 02:07:13.580]  Yeah, they're not humans.
[02:07:15.141 --> 02:07:15.961]  Well, see, I'm against that.
[02:07:17.452 --> 02:07:22.897]  And I'm against all the racial attacks against whites, which outnumber the racial attacks on blacks and Hispanics.
[02:07:23.417 --> 02:07:24.178]  Now, they're massive.
[02:07:24.918 --> 02:07:26.099]  I'm against it, folks.
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:30.523]  And, you know, I'm not bad because I'm against racist groups attacking whites.
[02:07:30.903 --> 02:07:33.605]  And I'm not bad because I'm against racist groups attacking blacks.
[02:07:33.906 --> 02:07:43.053]  And, folks, you've seen the websites and heard the calls and the whole shows about how I'm an evil Jew lover and how I'm an evil black lover.
[02:07:43.514 --> 02:07:46.176]  And then you find the sites where I'm an evil racist.
[02:07:46.934 --> 02:07:48.875]  You see, this is all these people are into.
[02:07:49.475 --> 02:07:55.458]  Jewish groups, which are Zionist, white groups, black groups, Hispanic groups, you guys are all a bunch of scum.
[02:07:56.838 --> 02:07:57.519]  You really are.
[02:07:57.939 --> 02:07:59.540]  I'm a human being that wants freedom.
[02:08:00.240 --> 02:08:02.481]  And I don't look at you by what color you are.
[02:08:02.921 --> 02:08:07.203]  But I'm watching to see, though, what you're going to do, what you're going to say.
[02:08:07.972 --> 02:08:11.295]  You know, I grew up, folks, where it was unheard of.
[02:08:11.315 --> 02:08:19.543]  You know, we didn't swagger around going, look at those black people, look at those N-words, look at those wetbacks, look at those, you know, all these terms.
[02:08:19.603 --> 02:08:25.128]  I never heard that stuff growing up in Dallas with all the whites I knew and all my white friends.
[02:08:25.608 --> 02:08:29.652]  But then I'm told how super widespread it is and how all over the place it is.
[02:08:31.562 --> 02:08:33.484]  Now, in my life now, I've heard it.
[02:08:34.064 --> 02:08:42.690]  Here and there, it's pretty rare, except you start talking about, listening to what black folks are saying and what Hispanics are saying, but see, they do it from a self-righteous point of view.
[02:08:44.852 --> 02:08:47.454]  Of, well, all the whites hate us, so we better hate them.
[02:08:48.875 --> 02:08:50.076]  See, that's not really the case.
[02:08:50.596 --> 02:08:51.996]  Though that's starting to turn.
[02:08:52.356 --> 02:08:55.238]  There are a lot of whites now that are going, I'm not going to be politically correct.
[02:08:55.558 --> 02:08:56.758]  I used to be a big liberal.
[02:08:57.098 --> 02:08:57.378]  No!
[02:08:57.839 --> 02:08:59.119]  No, I'm going to join!
[02:08:59.499 --> 02:09:01.640]  I'm going to join the National Alliance!
[02:09:05.302 --> 02:09:08.663]  Which again, just feeds into this whole thing and the globalists just laugh and love it.
[02:09:10.114 --> 02:09:12.535]  I don't hear these black groups talking about the Queen of England.
[02:09:12.935 --> 02:09:14.856]  I don't hear these white groups talking about the Queen of England.
[02:09:15.236 --> 02:09:16.677]  I don't hear them talking about Juan Carlos.
[02:09:16.697 --> 02:09:18.317]  I don't hear them talking about any of the Rothschilds.
[02:09:18.397 --> 02:09:18.757]  None of it!
[02:09:19.258 --> 02:09:19.698]  None of it!
[02:09:19.978 --> 02:09:24.339]  It's all just, let's fight with each other and let's go ahead and roll Paul Harvey.
[02:09:24.359 --> 02:09:24.780]  Here it is.
[02:09:27.121 --> 02:09:32.723]  On something for weeks, let's get it up and get it out for what it's worth.
[02:09:34.183 --> 02:09:38.745]  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill said that the American people
[02:09:40.086 --> 02:09:49.593]  He told the American people, he said, and this is a direct quote, we didn't come this far because we are made of sugar candy.
[02:09:51.094 --> 02:09:53.476]  That was his response to the attack on Pearl Harbor.
[02:09:54.256 --> 02:09:57.959]  That we didn't come this far because we're made of sugar candy.
[02:09:59.080 --> 02:10:00.761]  And that reminder was taken seriously.
[02:10:01.381 --> 02:10:06.004]  And we proceeded to develop and deliver the bomb, even though roughly 150,000 men, women, and children perished
[02:10:08.718 --> 02:10:15.442]  In Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with a single blow, World War II was over.
[02:10:16.703 --> 02:10:27.190]  Following New York, September 11, Pearl Harbor, Winston Churchill was not here to remind us that we didn't come this far because we're made of sugar candy.
[02:10:28.151 --> 02:10:37.477]  So, following the New York disaster, we mustered our humanity, we gave old pals a pass,
[02:10:38.869 --> 02:10:59.604]  Even though men and money from Saudi Arabia were largely responsible for the devastation of New York and Pennsylvania and our Pentagon, we called the Saudi Arabians our partners against terrorism and we sent men with rifles into Afghanistan and Iraq and we kept our best weapons in their silos.
[02:11:01.145 --> 02:11:03.707]  Even now we're standing there dying
[02:11:04.577 --> 02:11:13.464]  Daring to do nothing decisive because we've declared ourselves to be better than our terrorist enemies, more moral, more civilized.
[02:11:14.785 --> 02:11:16.826]  Our image is at stake, we insist.
[02:11:17.807 --> 02:11:21.830]  But we didn't come this far because we're made of sugar candy.
[02:11:22.771 --> 02:11:33.099]  Once upon a time, we elbowed our way onto and into this continent by giving smallpox-infected blankets to Native Americans.
[02:11:33.849 --> 02:11:36.210]  Yes, that was biological warfare.
[02:11:37.330 --> 02:11:44.132]  And we used every other weapon we could get our hands on to grab this land from whomever, and we grew prosperous.
[02:11:44.452 --> 02:11:48.034]  And yes, we greased the skids with the sweat of slaves.
[02:11:49.354 --> 02:11:55.536]  And so it goes with most great nation-states, which feeling guilty about their savage pasts,
[02:11:56.258 --> 02:12:07.666]  Eventually civilize themselves out of business and wind up invaded and ultimately dominated by the lean, hungry, up-and-coming who are not made of sugar candy.
[02:12:08.026 --> 02:12:08.887]  Paul Harvey.
[02:12:09.767 --> 02:12:10.248]  Good day.
[02:12:11.809 --> 02:12:14.330]  So we played that because it's so evil to analyze it.
[02:12:14.971 --> 02:12:16.072]  Now listen to this.
[02:12:16.772 --> 02:12:18.913]  As if Iraq, I thought we were there liberating them.
[02:12:19.354 --> 02:12:20.134]  What are the targets?
[02:12:20.194 --> 02:12:21.275]  Name the military target.
[02:12:21.415 --> 02:12:21.936]  Baghdad?
[02:12:22.156 --> 02:12:23.457]  Four and a half, five million people?
[02:12:24.497 --> 02:12:25.038]  What we're just...
[02:12:26.229 --> 02:12:27.510]  Fifteen percent of it Christian.
[02:12:28.550 --> 02:12:29.411]  Five percent Jew.
[02:12:30.051 --> 02:12:32.232]  We're just gonna bomb that city!
[02:12:33.373 --> 02:12:35.795]  I hear this on talk radio every day when I tune in.
[02:12:36.155 --> 02:12:39.577]  Literally every time I tune in, if you listen long enough, that's not, that's an exaggeration.
[02:12:39.637 --> 02:12:41.938]  Every week or two I hear it, but I don't listen that much.
[02:12:43.479 --> 02:12:44.700]  I hear it on a routine basis.
[02:12:45.320 --> 02:12:47.021]  I know you hear it every day if you listen every day.
[02:12:47.041 --> 02:12:48.342]  I mean, it's just, let's nuke them.
[02:12:48.362 --> 02:12:49.823]  Let's nuke Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:50.263 --> 02:12:53.745]  It was a minority of people in Saudi Arabia that fund
[02:12:55.143 --> 02:12:56.283]  The Wahhabi sect.
[02:12:56.343 --> 02:12:58.844]  The Wahhabi sect is a minority in Saudi Arabia.
[02:12:59.384 --> 02:13:04.985]  That's like if a gang is operating in East Austin robbing old ladies and has killed 20 people.
[02:13:05.225 --> 02:13:07.365]  That's like saying, let's nuke Austin, Texas.
[02:13:07.745 --> 02:13:09.226]  It makes no sense.
[02:13:09.546 --> 02:13:12.006]  It's not like it's a military target with, say, Japan.
[02:13:13.226 --> 02:13:15.887]  And then he's just, oh, we gave smallpox blankets because that's true.
[02:13:15.927 --> 02:13:17.747]  They've got the manuals on how to do it.
[02:13:18.147 --> 02:13:21.268]  The Brits did it even before this was America.
[02:13:21.628 --> 02:13:22.088]  It was done.
[02:13:22.128 --> 02:13:22.908]  The French did it too.
[02:13:24.628 --> 02:13:25.668]  To knock out the natives.
[02:13:26.408 --> 02:13:29.369]  And he just calmly, haha, we're not made, we're tough!
[02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:30.829]  We poison people!
[02:13:30.869 --> 02:13:32.310]  We bio-weapon them!
[02:13:32.730 --> 02:13:35.691]  Oh, and we grease the skins with black slaves!
[02:13:36.011 --> 02:13:37.591]  That's how we built this country!
[02:13:37.691 --> 02:13:38.731]  What does that mean?
[02:13:38.751 --> 02:13:47.773]  By the way, it's been proven that only 1% of Southerners owned slaves.
[02:13:48.694 --> 02:13:54.095]  And that it was used to actually leverage out the economy and keep the wages down.
[02:13:55.589 --> 02:13:58.331]  It's like these idiots who go, make them prisoners work!
[02:13:58.371 --> 02:14:03.575]  Yeah, you catch the black kid with some cocaine, put him in jail for five years, mandatory sentence, and make him work!
[02:14:04.716 --> 02:14:08.899]  Well, that little black kid or little white kid's competing against you for 20 cents an hour.
[02:14:09.299 --> 02:14:11.961]  He's working at a, at a, building stuff against you.
[02:14:12.001 --> 02:14:13.242]  That's why you don't have a job!
[02:14:14.887 --> 02:14:15.507]  The same thing.
[02:14:15.607 --> 02:14:18.269]  Slavery wasn't good for this country.
[02:14:18.909 --> 02:14:19.770]  It's never good.
[02:14:20.090 --> 02:14:21.931]  Slavery brought down the Roman Empire.
[02:14:21.971 --> 02:14:25.773]  Made them fat and weak and lackadaisical.
[02:14:28.674 --> 02:14:29.455]  So I'm sick of it.
[02:14:31.336 --> 02:14:32.576]  I mean, I really am sick of it.
[02:14:32.616 --> 02:14:33.877]  And you want to know what built this country?
[02:14:33.897 --> 02:14:35.478]  It was Chinese slaves, folks.
[02:14:36.158 --> 02:14:38.499]  You want to know what really got the railroads going?
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:39.200]  It was Irish.
[02:14:39.966 --> 02:14:43.527]  Predominantly, but also, we'll talk about some minority group, it was Chinese.
[02:14:43.867 --> 02:14:47.229]  You never really hear about them though, because they're not in the business of griping and complaining too much.
[02:14:47.909 --> 02:14:49.810]  They're in the business of working hard and taking over.
[02:14:49.830 --> 02:14:53.191]  That's why I don't hear much from them, they're just taking over.
[02:14:54.231 --> 02:14:54.911]  Fine and dandy.
[02:14:55.031 --> 02:14:58.733]  Look, the point here is, is that I am tired of this.
[02:15:00.934 --> 02:15:01.914]  I'm tired of it.
[02:15:04.536 --> 02:15:07.477]  I mean, it shows the sickness, the decadence of our country.
[02:15:07.538 --> 02:15:11.219]  Our president says, I don't care if we're tortured, I'm going to veto it, we're going to keep torture going.
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:16.621]  Ann Coulter saying, take the gloves off, we need to kill more civilians, we need to be more brutal.
[02:15:16.881 --> 02:15:18.182]  That will just cause more resistance.
[02:15:18.522 --> 02:15:30.407]  And now let's just nuke countries, and black slaves are good, and black leaders, let's kill all the whites, and I call up some Mexican Independence Day parade and go, are you guys racial?
[02:15:30.427 --> 02:15:31.728]  Yeah, you're white, aren't you?
[02:15:31.748 --> 02:15:32.388]  You're a racist.
[02:15:32.887 --> 02:15:33.948]  We're going to get your women!
[02:15:34.008 --> 02:15:36.670]  I'm just like, you know, what planet am I living on?
[02:15:38.071 --> 02:15:56.745]  You see, all this multiculturalism done is actually, what it does is it fills all the so-called minority groups full of racial hatred and angst, and then it neutralizes the middle class, which is predominantly white, to just lay there while this rebellion breeds, then they're going to switch that off like a switch, and have us all fighting with each other, and meanwhile the elite can totally dominate us and control us.
[02:15:59.437 --> 02:16:07.321]  Well, I'm not made of sugar candy, folks, and I don't care what the peer pressure says, and I don't care how it blows, and I don't care how many people of some other group hate me.
[02:16:07.381 --> 02:16:09.402]  I'm not going to hate them because of their race.
[02:16:09.502 --> 02:16:12.003]  I will defend myself, and I will expose them.
[02:16:15.065 --> 02:16:18.287]  But we want to be free, folks.
[02:16:18.307 --> 02:16:22.689]  We've got to navigate this archipelago of minefields.
[02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:26.791]  And we've got to realize what we're dealing with here.
[02:16:27.771 --> 02:16:28.852]  It's economics.
[02:16:30.416 --> 02:16:35.117]  We are going into a very oppressive, predatory, economic climate.
[02:16:35.177 --> 02:16:43.878]  We're going into the final phases as they finish the final construction elements of the world government.
[02:16:44.618 --> 02:16:49.859]  And the world government is designed to kill 85% of us conservatively.
[02:16:50.580 --> 02:16:51.700]  And folks, it's public.
[02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:56.381]  They put the same stuff in the white people's vaccines they put in the black people's vaccines.
[02:16:56.901 --> 02:16:59.141]  They put the same stuff in your Diet Coke.
[02:17:00.174 --> 02:17:02.995]  They put the same stuff in your corn and your soybeans.
[02:17:03.855 --> 02:17:09.996]  They spray the same stuff in the air and there's more white kids on Ritalin and Prozac than this black professor knows that.
[02:17:10.836 --> 02:17:12.877]  So it's not some white plan to kill the blacks.
[02:17:13.337 --> 02:17:14.997]  It's a plan to enslave us all.
[02:17:15.297 --> 02:17:17.398]  The elite is threatened by all of us!
[02:17:19.558 --> 02:17:21.319]  So we shouldn't be at each other's throats.
[02:17:24.520 --> 02:17:26.220]  And that's the message that'll get you killed.
[02:17:27.199 --> 02:17:33.143]  It was the New World Order and you think those old white bankers are threatened by this black professor or by David Duke?
[02:17:33.203 --> 02:17:33.703]  No, they're not.
[02:17:34.083 --> 02:17:37.665]  They're threatened by people like me and Malcolm X. We'll be right back.
[02:17:40.257 --> 02:17:43.558]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[02:17:43.898 --> 02:17:49.179]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[02:17:49.439 --> 02:17:51.320]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.

[02:18:09.364 --> 02:18:13.346]  And folks with braces or dentures will love that clean, fresh, just-from-the-dentist-office feeling.
[02:18:13.567 --> 02:18:16.909]  And once you've tried Vitamir®, you just may find that no other toothpaste or mouthwash will do.

[02:18:31.898 --> 02:18:35.400]  Try Vitamir® and you'll feel that squeaky clean sensation others just talk about.
[02:18:38.965 --> 02:18:39.526]  Currency devaluation.
[02:18:39.606 --> 02:18:39.846]  Inflation.
[02:18:39.926 --> 02:18:40.466]  One and the same.
[02:18:40.527 --> 02:18:44.971]  If you had deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[02:18:58.945 --> 02:19:02.068]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[02:19:02.328 --> 02:19:04.169]  The bank pays you 1%.
[02:19:04.250 --> 02:19:07.672]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[02:19:07.933 --> 02:19:10.014]  Here is reality.
[02:19:10.395 --> 02:19:13.978]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[02:19:14.438 --> 02:19:18.121]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[02:19:18.682 --> 02:19:21.264]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[02:19:22.839 --> 02:19:26.561]  Learn how to protect and profit in this truly unstable world economy.
[02:19:26.922 --> 02:19:28.102]  Call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:28.122 --> 02:19:28.322]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:19:39.926 --> 02:19:40.346]  We're good to go.
[02:20:00.998 --> 02:20:01.398]  I think so.
[02:20:33.685 --> 02:20:39.330]  Did you know there is an easy and inexpensive way for you to look and feel better in less than 30 days?
[02:20:39.490 --> 02:20:45.515]  You can lose excess weight, have more energy, sleep better, and be mentally on top of your games without even trying.
[02:20:45.575 --> 02:20:49.259]  This is not about vitamins or the latest nutritional wonder products.
[02:20:49.299 --> 02:20:50.460]  We've all had enough of those.
[02:20:50.760 --> 02:20:53.461]  I'm talking about God's pure, whole food.
[02:20:53.501 --> 02:20:56.282]  When you consume them, you look and feel better automatically.
[02:20:56.302 --> 02:21:02.543]  And thanks to URI International, you don't have to endure tasteless food or the expense and hassle of juicing.

[02:21:27.698 --> 02:21:28.138]  That's 888-224-7416.
[02:21:40.706 --> 02:21:44.389]  I hear the train a-comin', it's rollin' round the bend.
[02:21:45.289 --> 02:21:47.531]  And I ain't seen the sunshine since.
[02:21:48.151 --> 02:21:51.293]  I don't know when, I'm stuck in Folsom Prison.
[02:21:52.353 --> 02:21:54.335]  And Tom keeps a dragon on.
[02:21:54.895 --> 02:21:55.475]  That's pretty good.
[02:21:55.495 --> 02:21:58.817]  Sing some Johnny Cash and play Stingram at the bottom of it.
[02:21:59.438 --> 02:22:01.479]  Now see, that's never been done, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:01.959 --> 02:22:02.980]  We're here to do it first.
[02:22:05.046 --> 02:22:08.328]  I was just thinking about how obvious all this is when you just sit here and look at it.
[02:22:08.368 --> 02:22:11.950]  It's the same thing over and over and over again.
[02:22:11.970 --> 02:22:14.012]  And it works like a charm.
[02:22:16.874 --> 02:22:19.375]  The establishment is doing such bad things to us right now.
[02:22:19.395 --> 02:22:25.559]  Alright, let me cover news and then coming up the next segment we'll get to Wyatt, Michael, Tim, Sharon, John and others.
[02:22:26.980 --> 02:22:31.723]  Spy agency fake key Vietnam War data.
[02:22:33.180 --> 02:22:34.261]  And it's the London Telegraph.
[02:22:34.281 --> 02:22:35.221]  Here's our little comment.
[02:22:36.242 --> 02:22:49.548]  The spin here is that it was all one big mistake that LBJ presidential tapes proved that LBJ knew the incident never happened and he was discussing how to politically spin it for war propaganda.
[02:22:49.868 --> 02:22:50.849]  And we have the flashback.
[02:22:51.249 --> 02:22:53.090]  LBJ tapes on the Gulf of Tonkin incident.
[02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.570]  Flashback.
[02:22:53.990 --> 02:22:58.332]  LBJ admitted in secret tape the Gulf of Tonkin incident never happened and then had a lie about it.
[02:22:58.712 --> 02:22:59.273]  Flashback.
[02:22:59.733 --> 02:23:00.793]  Tonkin Gulf lie.
[02:23:00.834 --> 02:23:01.634]  Launched Vietnam War.
[02:23:03.126 --> 02:23:04.430]  Let me get into this new article.
[02:23:04.551 --> 02:23:09.125]  One of America's spy agencies faked the intelligence used to justify its investigation.
[02:23:10.791 --> 02:23:14.072]  For intervention in the Vietnam War, it was disclosed yesterday.
[02:23:14.593 --> 02:23:23.256]  But the revelation was kept secret by the National Security Agency, partly because of fears it would boost criticism of the intelligence services over the war in Iraq.
[02:23:23.476 --> 02:23:24.316]  Uh, yeah, no kidding.
[02:23:24.336 --> 02:23:33.080]  According to material uncovered by the NSA's own historian, Robert Hanyuk, middle-ranking officers altered material relating to the Goltlatt-Tonkin incident.
[02:23:34.197 --> 02:23:35.218]  We don't need them.
[02:23:36.319 --> 02:23:40.383]  Seven years ago, eight years ago, I interviewed some of the people that were on the ships.
[02:23:40.403 --> 02:23:41.423]  They were told to go up there.
[02:23:41.864 --> 02:23:44.906]  They attacked an island up in the middle of the Potomac and pulled out.
[02:23:45.547 --> 02:23:47.268]  And the Vietnamese were so smart.
[02:23:47.328 --> 02:23:48.469]  I'm not defending them, folks.
[02:23:48.489 --> 02:23:49.410]  I'm not defending the communists.
[02:23:49.490 --> 02:23:51.592]  The point is, they were so smart they didn't shoot back.
[02:23:53.313 --> 02:23:55.255]  They weren't dumb, okay?
[02:23:56.474 --> 02:23:58.916]  And this went on for hours, and then it's LBJ.
[02:23:58.976 --> 02:24:03.338]  I gotta find that tape and play it again, but... I think it's in the computer, but it's so obnoxious.
[02:24:03.378 --> 02:24:12.224]  It goes... You know, every time the tape goes around, it's this horrible thump noise, but... Yes, Mr. President.
[02:24:12.524 --> 02:24:13.104]  It's a nightmare.
[02:24:13.885 --> 02:24:15.125]  I'm down here at the ranch.
[02:24:15.285 --> 02:24:15.726]  He burps.
[02:24:16.066 --> 02:24:19.308]  I mean, literally, he's just so, so, so disgusting.
[02:24:19.728 --> 02:24:21.449]  And, like, LBJ's going, listen here.
[02:24:21.769 --> 02:24:22.610]  I'm down here at the ranch.
[02:24:23.132 --> 02:24:26.713]  This Gulf of Tonga thing didn't happen, but how are we going to deal with it and use it?
[02:24:27.173 --> 02:24:32.754]  Well, Mr. President, the press is already getting on to it, so we've got to tell them again that we were attacked and this could be used to get into the war.
[02:24:33.314 --> 02:24:34.614]  Sounds good to me.
[02:24:34.634 --> 02:24:36.295]  Hold on a minute.
[02:24:37.335 --> 02:24:38.355]  All right.
[02:24:39.055 --> 02:24:40.896]  Tell them exactly what I say then.
[02:24:40.916 --> 02:24:44.956]  I mean, that's basically what's on the tape.
[02:24:47.972 --> 02:24:49.292]  We've got it somewhere on the website.
[02:24:49.312 --> 02:24:49.753]  I'll link to it.
[02:24:49.773 --> 02:24:50.973]  You can listen to hours of it.
[02:24:51.433 --> 02:24:54.834]  There's several discussions about it, but that's the... It's not funny, though.
[02:24:54.854 --> 02:24:57.195]  I shouldn't be laughing.
[02:24:57.655 --> 02:24:59.015]  58,000 people died out of that line.
[02:24:59.035 --> 02:25:00.916]  Of course, a few years later, they didn't just fake attacks.
[02:25:01.256 --> 02:25:02.496]  They'd actually attack a U.S.
[02:25:02.556 --> 02:25:04.197]  ship and try to blame it on Egypt.
[02:25:05.477 --> 02:25:08.958]  So this stuff never ends, and this is mainstream news yet again.
[02:25:10.949 --> 02:25:15.893]  Ann Coulter, when I had her on, she's written a book about how the Patriot Act is wonderful, but then I said, well, what about Section 802?
[02:25:16.113 --> 02:25:18.194]  She said on air, oh, I haven't read it.
[02:25:20.116 --> 02:25:21.917]  Well, same thing here out of Media Matters.
[02:25:22.137 --> 02:25:22.537]  Coulter!
[02:25:23.138 --> 02:25:26.280]  I've never heard of Scooter Libby until ten minutes ago.
[02:25:26.700 --> 02:25:27.661]  She's going, what's the big deal?
[02:25:27.681 --> 02:25:28.041]  Who is he?
[02:25:28.241 --> 02:25:29.302]  I've never even heard of him.
[02:25:29.342 --> 02:25:30.423]  And they're like, are you serious?
[02:25:30.663 --> 02:25:31.623]  Well, yeah, who is he?
[02:25:32.024 --> 02:25:35.166]  He was the Chief of Staff for the Vice President, you bimbo!
[02:25:37.842 --> 02:25:45.129]  And I see people all over with the Ann Coulter books at the mall or at the park sitting there reading it like they're reading the Bible or something.
[02:25:45.369 --> 02:25:47.871]  And I've read one of her books, it's written in a 5th grade level, folks.
[02:25:50.133 --> 02:25:56.699]  And these people read this stuff like they're reading some great rabbinical study or something.
[02:25:58.641 --> 02:25:59.342]  It's amazing.
[02:26:01.048 --> 02:26:05.011]  Some UK police appear to be little better than criminals according to a major think tank.
[02:26:05.351 --> 02:26:07.733]  This is the BBC, Telegraph, and the News.
[02:26:08.333 --> 02:26:22.682]  And it says that they report that policing standards are set to where the only criteria is that you not be intelligent, again below 100 IQ, and that it's actually encouraged to have people with criminal records or who are criminals.
[02:26:23.223 --> 02:26:26.265]  Yeah, when you've got criminal governments, folks, you've got criminal cops.
[02:26:26.925 --> 02:26:29.527]  And right here in Austin, we're not allowed to know the record of cops.
[02:26:30.080 --> 02:26:32.061]  They're going to know your record, though, when you're driving around.
[02:26:32.082 --> 02:26:35.244]  They can run your plate whenever they want, but they can be criminals.
[02:26:36.985 --> 02:26:37.586]  Stalin did it.
[02:26:37.626 --> 02:26:38.146]  Hitler did it.
[02:26:38.807 --> 02:26:40.348]  And you bet America's going to do it.
[02:26:41.549 --> 02:26:43.390]  It is muy serious.
[02:26:44.351 --> 02:26:45.732]  This is one in Telegraph 2.
[02:26:45.792 --> 02:26:46.692]  The U.N.
[02:26:46.732 --> 02:26:52.497]  tells Syria, cooperate or else, over inquiry into the murder.
[02:26:53.658 --> 02:26:55.339]  Well, when we come back, we'll tell you about it.
[02:26:55.999 --> 02:26:57.120]  This is the classic deal.
[02:26:57.140 --> 02:26:59.382]  See, they play the good cop, and the good cop is pretty honoring.
[02:26:59.944 --> 02:27:04.268]  Listen, you do exactly as we say, or Billy Bob there is gonna blow your head off.
[02:27:05.669 --> 02:27:06.930]  That's the UN, they're the good cop.
[02:27:07.210 --> 02:27:09.772]  Now you answer our questions, you do exactly as we're told.
[02:27:10.293 --> 02:27:12.034]  You're gonna sign this plea agreement right now.
[02:27:12.354 --> 02:27:13.955]  I don't care if you didn't commit the crime.
[02:27:14.256 --> 02:27:19.800]  You're gonna sign right here, or Big Bubba's gonna have his way with it.
[02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:20.741]  You got that, buddy?
[02:27:23.683 --> 02:27:24.584]  We're on the march.
[02:27:25.065 --> 02:27:26.586]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:27.583 --> 02:27:30.344]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:33.685 --> 02:27:36.065]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[02:27:36.306 --> 02:27:40.147]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[02:27:40.467 --> 02:27:41.287]  Read the labels.
[02:27:41.707 --> 02:27:45.828]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:46.048 --> 02:27:50.249]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:27:50.630 --> 02:27:55.491]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:27:55.871 --> 02:27:59.434]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[02:27:59.654 --> 02:28:04.978]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[02:28:05.258 --> 02:28:08.000]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[02:28:08.301 --> 02:28:09.181]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:28:33.628 --> 02:28:37.192]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:28:37.232 --> 02:28:37.753]  are located?
[02:28:37.953 --> 02:28:41.336]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?
[02:28:41.577 --> 02:28:46.281]  You can find these answers and more in the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA.

[02:29:10.461 --> 02:29:11.002]  We're good to go.
[02:29:33.476 --> 02:29:37.360]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:39.241]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[02:29:39.321 --> 02:29:40.562]  But not just any water.
[02:29:40.663 --> 02:29:44.866]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[02:29:44.946 --> 02:29:54.635]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[02:29:54.935 --> 02:30:00.542]  RPA Biotech's personal care products are specially formulated to kill bacteria, virus, fungus, and spores.
[02:30:00.742 --> 02:30:05.328]  Use topically to treat acne, athlete's foot, eczema, psoriasis, burned skin, rashes, and more.
[02:30:05.508 --> 02:30:09.453]  Use EO orally to treat sore throat, canker sores, and inflamed and bleeding gums.
[02:30:09.953 --> 02:30:12.635]  And I heard, as it were, the noise of thunder.
[02:30:39.012 --> 02:30:46.354]  one of the four beasts saying come and see and I saw and behold a white horse
[02:30:57.394 --> 02:31:00.595]  There's a man going around taking names.
[02:31:02.156 --> 02:31:05.498]  And he decides who to free and who to blame.
[02:31:07.780 --> 02:31:10.581]  Everybody will be treated all the same.
[02:31:12.423 --> 02:31:15.304]  There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.
[02:31:18.673 --> 02:31:37.917]  When the man comes around The hairs on your arm will stand up At the terror in each sip and in each suck Will you partake of that last offered cup?
[02:31:40.017 --> 02:31:44.238]  Or disappear into the potter's ground?
[02:31:45.378 --> 02:31:47.659]  When the man comes around
[02:31:50.201 --> 02:31:52.502]  Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers.
[02:31:54.843 --> 02:31:57.384]  One hundred million angels singing.
[02:31:59.985 --> 02:32:04.086]  Multitudes are marching to the big cuddle drum.
[02:32:06.167 --> 02:32:11.089]  Voices calling, voices crying.
[02:32:11.149 --> 02:32:14.970]  Some are born and some are dying.
[02:32:15.631 --> 02:32:18.712]  It's Alpha and Omega's kingdom come.
[02:32:20.518 --> 02:32:25.622]  And the whirlwind is in the thorn tree.
[02:32:25.822 --> 02:32:28.465]  The virgins are all trimming their wigs.
[02:32:30.727 --> 02:32:34.650]  The whirlwind is in the thorn tree.
[02:32:35.611 --> 02:32:38.733]  It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks.
[02:32:42.737 --> 02:32:45.999]  Till Armageddon, no shalom, no shalom.
[02:32:47.801 --> 02:32:50.844]  Then the father hen will call his chickens home.
[02:32:52.965 --> 02:32:55.668]  The wise men will bow down before the throne.
[02:32:57.909 --> 02:33:00.912]  And at his feet they'll cast their golden crowns.
[02:33:03.254 --> 02:33:05.656]  When the man comes around.
[02:33:07.877 --> 02:33:11.861]  Whoever is unjust, let him be unjust too.
[02:33:13.124 --> 02:33:16.727]  Whoever is righteous, let him be righteous still.
[02:33:17.748 --> 02:33:21.671]  Whoever is filthy, let him be filthy still.
[02:33:22.732 --> 02:33:27.796]  Listen to the words long written down.
[02:33:28.457 --> 02:33:31.619]  When the man comes around.
[02:33:32.560 --> 02:33:34.842]  Hear the trumpets, hear the pipers.
[02:33:37.604 --> 02:33:39.606]  100 million angels singing.
[02:33:41.696 --> 02:33:43.436]  Now that's a good little Johnny Cash track.
[02:33:43.456 --> 02:33:44.957]  I think he did that a few years before he died.
[02:33:46.157 --> 02:33:48.377]  We're, uh, gonna be going to some of your calls here.
[02:33:48.397 --> 02:33:49.437]  I got some other news I want to cover.
[02:33:50.518 --> 02:33:54.818]  UN tells Syria cooperator else over inquiry into Harari murder.
[02:33:55.699 --> 02:34:06.420]  Syria was formally ordered yesterday, ordered, see, by the world government, to halt its interference with the international inquiry into the murder of former Lebanese Prime Minister or face the consequences.
[02:34:07.961 --> 02:34:09.181]  You see, this is global government.
[02:34:09.955 --> 02:34:17.680]  The United Nations Security Council unanimously agreed to the ultimatum in a resolution passed by a meeting of foreign ministers in New York.
[02:34:18.841 --> 02:34:31.810]  Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary of England, told the gathering that President Bashar Assad's regime must change its behavior over the UN-authorized inquiry into the murder of the Lebanese leader, Rafiq Harari.
[02:34:33.111 --> 02:34:37.734]  The Security Council was putting the government of Syria on notice that our patience has limits!
[02:34:40.495 --> 02:34:41.616]  Mr. Strauss says.
[02:34:43.538 --> 02:34:55.047]  He imagined the UN coming here and saying, uh, well there's evidence Bill Clinton murdered Secretary Ron Brown, and if you don't let us basically run your government, we're gonna invade you!
[02:34:55.067 --> 02:35:04.115]  Meanwhile, Lord Bush has given a speech about how the evil flu may get us, and he needs billions of dollars to give directly to his buddies.
[02:35:05.942 --> 02:35:09.184]  And then we have this article, Rumsfeld's growing stake in Tamiflu.
[02:35:09.724 --> 02:35:11.224]  This is out of Fortune Magazine.
[02:35:11.244 --> 02:35:19.288]  Defense Secretary, ex-chairman of Flu Treatment, rights holder, sees portfolio value growing.
[02:35:19.948 --> 02:35:26.211]  Yes, and the total stock's going up tens of billions of dollars, but he's set to make $25 million.
[02:35:27.352 --> 02:35:29.493]  And it could go up to $47 million if it continues.
[02:35:29.513 --> 02:35:31.674]  That's a whole bunch of money to be made there.
[02:35:32.395 --> 02:35:34.436]  George Shultz is making some goodies.
[02:35:34.476 --> 02:35:36.137]  Of course, George Shultz always does.
[02:35:36.217 --> 02:35:39.318]  There's so many others, so really, where to stop?
[02:35:41.699 --> 02:35:42.339]  Where to start?
[02:35:42.379 --> 02:35:44.740]  There's just too much!
[02:35:45.600 --> 02:35:48.381]  I mentioned this yesterday in passing, but I should have spent more time on it.
[02:35:48.982 --> 02:35:54.504]  We've got British troops repeatedly dressed up like Arabs, running around shooting with bombs and bombing things.
[02:35:54.524 --> 02:35:55.764]  We've got Israelis doing it.
[02:35:57.025 --> 02:35:57.585]  That's public.
[02:35:58.745 --> 02:35:59.886]  In Israel and in Iraq.
[02:36:01.466 --> 02:36:02.146]  We've caught U.S.
[02:36:02.166 --> 02:36:03.707]  troops sneaking around doing it.
[02:36:03.727 --> 02:36:08.129]  Witnesses have seen white guys kidnapping people who then have their heads cut off later.
[02:36:09.970 --> 02:36:15.012]  The FBI openly gave Nick Berg over to Al-Qaeda.
[02:36:15.052 --> 02:36:15.592]  That's admitted.
[02:36:15.652 --> 02:36:20.494]  Oh, he was in their custody and then given to Al-Qaeda and they sawed his head off as he squealed.
[02:36:21.395 --> 02:36:22.836]  But this is out of England.
[02:36:22.856 --> 02:36:24.116]  It's in several publications.
[02:36:24.176 --> 02:36:28.598]  Terrorists steal British government's mobile phone and they've been using it for months and run up a $990,000 bill.
[02:36:32.242 --> 02:36:34.483]  Half a million pound bill that was missing.
[02:36:35.184 --> 02:36:40.346]  In fact, it's been missing since June, when the British Embassy in Baghdad blocked it after the company had leased it.
[02:36:41.167 --> 02:36:45.509]  Notice discrepancies in the billing pattern, but it had been used to contact all the big Al Qaeda people.
[02:36:45.529 --> 02:36:47.670]  It's just always the same MO.
[02:36:47.991 --> 02:36:51.332]  Always the same story.
[02:36:51.493 --> 02:36:53.574]  Hey, Nazi doctor death reported.
[02:36:55.695 --> 02:36:58.997]  Nazi doctor death reported to have lived in Spain for 20 years.
[02:36:59.037 --> 02:37:01.418]  This is out of the People's Daily out of China.
[02:37:02.190 --> 02:37:09.640]  And this is interesting because, I mean, he ought to have the Nazi come over and give a speech on C-SPAN about killing all the people of color.
[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:15.087]  I mean, I find it distasteful and dangerous, but, you know, I mean, this is part of the course now, nowadays.
[02:37:15.588 --> 02:37:17.070]  Have the black leaders up there saying that.
[02:37:17.962 --> 02:37:24.548]  A Austrian doctor accused of killing hundreds of inmates in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II has been hiding in Spain for 20 years.
[02:37:24.588 --> 02:37:26.129]  The Spanish newspaper reported on Sunday.
[02:37:26.489 --> 02:37:32.554]  Government authorities say they are hunting for Albert Heem, 91, known as Dr. Death.
[02:37:32.574 --> 02:37:34.255]  I thought Jack Kevorkian was known as that.
[02:37:35.496 --> 02:37:40.961]  Heem worked in a Fusilin concentration camp in Austria, and it goes on.
[02:37:42.745 --> 02:37:45.786]  And I can't read this German, it's Mauthusen.
[02:37:46.286 --> 02:37:48.287]  I know I've got German listeners laughing at me right now.
[02:37:49.007 --> 02:37:49.608]  I can't read it.
[02:37:49.908 --> 02:37:51.988]  Here's another article, just another one here.
[02:37:52.829 --> 02:37:57.470]  Most offspring died when mother rats accidentally engineered soy.
[02:37:57.510 --> 02:37:58.551]  Another one on corn.
[02:37:59.071 --> 02:38:03.773]  And now I want to talk for a few minutes about Halloween, and I will get to Wyatt and others who are patiently holding.
[02:38:05.373 --> 02:38:07.414]  This is the news today after Halloween.
[02:38:08.982 --> 02:38:15.884]  For some Americans, every day is Halloween, bizarre sex, self-mutilation, love of death, becoming increasingly commonplace.
[02:38:16.204 --> 02:38:25.646]  And I know so many middle-class parents, and these are well-to-do families, whose daughters are into goth, who cut themselves, who drink blood, who are into Satanism.
[02:38:26.286 --> 02:38:27.506]  It is explosive!
[02:38:28.826 --> 02:38:30.867]  And it's sold to them by this culture,
[02:38:31.644 --> 02:38:35.246]  And I want these young people to know the world is beautiful and lovely and great.
[02:38:35.266 --> 02:38:36.827]  There's so much to be offered.
[02:38:37.387 --> 02:38:39.548]  And just go out and look at this blue sky today.
[02:38:40.328 --> 02:38:40.769]  Stop it!
[02:38:40.829 --> 02:38:43.610]  No matter how mutilated your body is, you can always turn back.
[02:38:43.630 --> 02:38:45.231]  You can always get into life.
[02:38:46.211 --> 02:38:47.372]  And I know you're looking for power.
[02:38:47.392 --> 02:38:50.153]  You'll find a lot more power in life and love.
[02:38:50.173 --> 02:38:53.475]  It's always been greater than death.
[02:38:54.736 --> 02:38:57.457]  But it's just a big article out of WorldNet Daily.
[02:38:57.497 --> 02:38:58.938]  Halloween is a time of bizarre.
[02:38:59.992 --> 02:39:02.053]  Or make-believe of the dark macabre.
[02:39:02.334 --> 02:39:04.235]  All in point of fun, of course.
[02:39:05.336 --> 02:39:11.480]  But then it goes into just massive examples of sex and murder and torture.
[02:39:12.821 --> 02:39:17.224]  They expose how there seems to be neither boundaries or taboos anymore when it comes to sex.
[02:39:17.304 --> 02:39:18.044]  Anything goes.
[02:39:18.224 --> 02:39:24.188]  From heterosexual to homosexual to bi, trans, poly, and you don't want to know sexual experiences.
[02:39:24.308 --> 02:39:28.011]  One such sexual experience that pushes extreme into the envelope is
[02:39:28.829 --> 02:39:36.773]  Bug chasing, very simply, bug chasing are people from whom getting infected with HIV is the ultimate sexual experience.
[02:39:36.813 --> 02:39:39.454]  And that was a big article in Rolling Stone.
[02:39:39.474 --> 02:39:41.515]  I mean, that's mainstream.
[02:39:41.715 --> 02:39:42.915]  Rolling Stone didn't believe it.
[02:39:42.955 --> 02:39:47.097]  They went and found out in San Francisco and New York and Houston and all over.
[02:39:47.157 --> 02:39:48.138]  They want HIV.
[02:39:50.146 --> 02:39:54.007]  Body piercing has progressed from traditional earrings to females to earrings for males.
[02:39:54.367 --> 02:39:56.728]  The multiple pairings for both females and males.
[02:39:56.948 --> 02:39:58.689]  Because that's not cool anymore though.
[02:39:59.329 --> 02:40:03.710]  Now they are doing mutilation where they cut off fingers.
[02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:04.610]  That's not cool.
[02:40:04.630 --> 02:40:05.551]  Gotta cut off hands.
[02:40:05.891 --> 02:40:06.631]  Both legs.
[02:40:07.491 --> 02:40:11.212]  And it just gets into... I can't read most of this.
[02:40:13.653 --> 02:40:18.395]  They have the iceberg ritual scarification.
[02:40:18.635 --> 02:40:19.675]  It just goes on and on.
[02:40:20.706 --> 02:40:27.631]  And we always see this, when Rome was about to fall, whenever Israel was about to fall, whenever... There's nothing new.
[02:40:27.651 --> 02:40:37.377]  See, they don't want you to be different in your mind, and different in standing up against the corrupt system, and different in defending your family, and having courage.
[02:40:38.177 --> 02:40:42.000]  They want you to mutilate and hurt yourself, and love death, and be groveling and weak.
[02:40:43.701 --> 02:40:48.264]  And I see these beautiful young women with four or five earrings on their lips, their nose, their eyes,
[02:40:49.535 --> 02:40:50.695]  They look so unhappy.
[02:40:51.135 --> 02:40:58.037]  And no matter what you do, there are people, there's a big art form, they call it, where somebody shoots you with a .357 Magnum.
[02:40:58.737 --> 02:41:04.118]  They just put it up underneath your arm through the fat and the muscle at point blank range with ball ammo.
[02:41:04.598 --> 02:41:06.239]  People like to have bullet holes in them.
[02:41:06.259 --> 02:41:07.279]  They think that's sexy.
[02:41:08.499 --> 02:41:12.600]  A lot of people are dying though in Mexico getting arms and legs cut off because they get infected.
[02:41:13.280 --> 02:41:14.460]  There's the clinics that'll do it.
[02:41:15.721 --> 02:41:17.261]  And I know I'm a hater, I'm a bigot.
[02:41:18.317 --> 02:41:21.279]  I'm against these people dying because they have sex with a horse.
[02:41:21.479 --> 02:41:21.739]  Yes.
[02:41:22.680 --> 02:41:26.942]  Yes, a man out of his farm out in, what was it, Oregon.
[02:41:27.002 --> 02:41:28.003]  It just happened last week.
[02:41:29.144 --> 02:41:34.367]  The horse was delivering to him and he died of that.
[02:41:34.387 --> 02:41:35.408]  I mean, it's just constant.
[02:41:35.808 --> 02:41:37.409]  Oh, and I'm backwards and bigoted.
[02:41:37.469 --> 02:41:37.669]  No!
[02:41:37.909 --> 02:41:41.331]  That's degenerate and gross and sick and full of death.
[02:41:42.892 --> 02:41:45.674]  You know, the man having a stallion mount him.
[02:41:47.356 --> 02:41:48.837]  There's stuff I can't even mention, folks.
[02:41:48.897 --> 02:41:50.878]  Blood, drinking, just all of it.
[02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:55.141]  Here's CNN.
[02:41:55.341 --> 02:41:57.283]  Tax break for witchcraft classes.
[02:41:57.943 --> 02:41:58.664]  Appalachian.
[02:41:59.604 --> 02:42:00.325]  Hobwebs.
[02:42:02.126 --> 02:42:03.607]  Cling from the wooden raptors.
[02:42:03.667 --> 02:42:08.950]  Dusty shelves are cluttered with glass jars of home-brewed potions, dried herbs, and stone amulets.
[02:42:09.331 --> 02:42:12.433]  An oil cooker and a black cauldron sits next to the corner.
[02:42:13.013 --> 02:42:14.354]  It's a Halloween party and
[02:42:15.662 --> 02:42:17.583]  They're getting federal funding to do it.
[02:42:19.043 --> 02:42:19.724]  Here's another one.
[02:42:20.204 --> 02:42:25.826]  Dead mourned, honored in Vancouver, Canada, a Halloween cemetery performance.
[02:42:26.146 --> 02:42:28.227]  This is out of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
[02:42:28.707 --> 02:42:33.929]  And it says they went and did rituals with the tombstones and the children, and communed with the dead spirits.
[02:42:34.689 --> 02:42:37.450]  That's what Halloween was.
[02:42:37.470 --> 02:42:40.171]  Samhain was communing with the dead.
[02:42:40.251 --> 02:42:41.371]  That's the Druid ritual.
[02:42:41.872 --> 02:42:42.792]  And they got the city,
[02:42:44.156 --> 02:42:46.697]  Vancouver, British Columbia desecrating these graves.
[02:42:46.817 --> 02:42:50.219]  Let me tell you, you better hope none of my family's in some grave when you try to pull this junk.
[02:42:50.659 --> 02:42:56.842]  You're not going to go grab on my grandfather's grave and gyrate and hump on it and think you're going to get away with it.
[02:42:56.862 --> 02:42:58.503]  You aren't supposed to walk on the graves.
[02:42:59.528 --> 02:43:01.829]  Show a little bit of respect, you degenerate scum!
[02:43:02.269 --> 02:43:07.491]  People walk quietly past lanterns and candlelit shrines, stop to mourn the graves and whisper to the dead.
[02:43:07.871 --> 02:43:16.134]  A few men in rock outfits and pink wigs, Superman costumes, and women dressed as flappers looked uncomfortable, trying to wrap their heads around what was happening.
[02:43:16.394 --> 02:43:26.200]  And it just says that, oh, it's funded by the city, and commuting with the dead is what the city wants to do now, and they go to the oldest cemetery there, and they hug the tombstones, and see?
[02:43:26.420 --> 02:43:28.001]  This is their religion, folks!
[02:43:28.481 --> 02:43:29.702]  And it's right out in the open.
[02:43:30.963 --> 02:43:31.663]  Here's another one.
[02:43:32.083 --> 02:43:35.806]  New law could link our courts with torture.
[02:43:36.186 --> 02:43:37.747]  Getting out of the Halloween news.
[02:43:37.787 --> 02:43:39.428]  Well, wait, that's come up in a second.
[02:43:39.448 --> 02:43:42.029]  I got my stacks out of order here.
[02:43:43.050 --> 02:43:45.031]  Where's my Detroit Free Press about
[02:43:45.751 --> 02:43:47.192]  All the witchcraft in Detroit.
[02:43:47.272 --> 02:43:48.373]  Now it's a big city event.
[02:43:48.833 --> 02:43:51.174]  Michigan Wiccans mark Halloween as start of New Year.
[02:43:51.214 --> 02:43:51.895]  That's one of them.
[02:43:52.535 --> 02:43:55.096]  For some, the time of the year means much more than Halloween.
[02:43:55.116 --> 02:43:55.937]  Gets into the witches.
[02:43:56.517 --> 02:43:58.458]  That's out of the Journal Times.
[02:43:58.478 --> 02:43:58.879]  That's not.
[02:43:59.279 --> 02:44:00.179]  Here's the Detroit Free Press.
[02:44:00.520 --> 02:44:02.601]  Wiccans mark Halloween as start of New Year.
[02:44:02.801 --> 02:44:03.241]  AP.
[02:44:04.282 --> 02:44:06.103]  And it just goes into how wonderful they are.
[02:44:06.123 --> 02:44:08.484]  And if you don't follow their religion, you're basically evil.
[02:44:12.607 --> 02:44:13.427]  Let's just take calls.
[02:44:13.467 --> 02:44:14.848]  I'll get back to the rest of this news.
[02:44:15.521 --> 02:44:18.642]  The point is, is that the Wiccans try to claim there's some new thing.
[02:44:18.702 --> 02:44:19.342]  It's not new.
[02:44:21.123 --> 02:44:30.666]  And every earth worship cult, from the Hawaiians to the Germanic Druids, engaged in human sacrifice.
[02:44:31.026 --> 02:44:32.526]  Now that's not debatable.
[02:44:33.647 --> 02:44:37.488]  They've dug up thousands of skeletons in England, who were ritualistically killed.
[02:44:37.948 --> 02:44:40.869]  And burning babies, and burning the noblemen,
[02:44:41.622 --> 02:44:42.622]  That is kind of different though.
[02:44:42.662 --> 02:44:47.184]  There they would actually, if things really got bad, they'd burn the nobleman and he would offer himself up.
[02:44:48.345 --> 02:44:50.105]  Slitting people's throats isn't cool.
[02:44:50.645 --> 02:44:53.086]  And I'm not going to give my children up to you bastards.
[02:44:54.267 --> 02:44:57.528]  And you can sit there and not know what your own religion is like a bunch of idiots.
[02:44:58.698 --> 02:45:00.619]  And tell me I'm some backwards Christian.
[02:45:01.079 --> 02:45:04.520]  Listen, Julius Caesar tried to ban what you were doing.
[02:45:04.560 --> 02:45:07.140]  Tex talked about that yesterday, but that's in his own writings.
[02:45:07.641 --> 02:45:13.922]  I mean, they pulled up and watched teenage kids on spits and people eating them, and Caesar said, kill these priests!
[02:45:14.543 --> 02:45:15.503]  These people are sick!
[02:45:15.903 --> 02:45:17.243]  And he was a pagan, folks!
[02:45:18.444 --> 02:45:19.584]  I mean, look!
[02:45:20.603 --> 02:45:23.024]  Look, human sacrifice is bad, okay?
[02:45:23.264 --> 02:45:27.567]  The Aztecs are bad, and I don't want to hear I'm talking bad about a culture, all cultures are good.
[02:45:28.147 --> 02:45:30.408]  As far as I'm concerned, the Nazis didn't have a good culture.
[02:45:30.648 --> 02:45:32.209]  They had a degenerate death culture.
[02:45:32.529 --> 02:45:33.610]  And so did the Aztecs.
[02:45:33.630 --> 02:45:35.211]  They're just as bad as the Nazis.
[02:45:36.251 --> 02:45:41.754]  Why do so many Mexicans I know, who are illegal aliens up here, why are they into that whole Aztec culture?
[02:45:42.115 --> 02:45:43.775]  They were hated by all the tribes.
[02:45:44.016 --> 02:45:47.177]  They were the people that ran around kidnapping the tribes and sacrificing them.
[02:45:47.678 --> 02:45:48.338]  You see, again,
[02:45:49.039 --> 02:45:51.201]  You've got the same taste as the New World Order.
[02:45:51.421 --> 02:46:02.849]  The New World Order has this taste, so they tell you with tax foundation money, in these radical liberation theology classes on school campuses, they fund Machin La Raza to teach you that.
[02:46:05.391 --> 02:46:06.572]  Alright, now I'm really ranting.
[02:46:07.393 --> 02:46:10.795]  Let's talk to... I don't want to hear this stuff, it's serious.
[02:46:11.156 --> 02:46:12.537]  It is serious, okay?
[02:46:12.817 --> 02:46:18.421]  There's an epidemic of people carving on themselves, and blood drinking, and all kinds of stuff.
[02:46:20.464 --> 02:46:23.265]  And all this Harry Potter stuff is a fast track right into it.
[02:46:23.705 --> 02:46:25.246]  You may think it's cutesy-tootsy.
[02:46:25.326 --> 02:46:25.646]  It isn't.
[02:46:26.466 --> 02:46:28.167]  Believe me, folks, I know, okay?
[02:46:28.847 --> 02:46:29.207]  I know.
[02:46:30.048 --> 02:46:33.329]  Let's go ahead... Yes, and I've talked about it before, folks.
[02:46:33.789 --> 02:46:35.270]  Believe me, I've seen it from the inside.
[02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:36.150]  Okay?
[02:46:36.750 --> 02:46:37.811]  And not for long, either.
[02:46:37.951 --> 02:46:40.172]  It was prolific where I grew up in Rockwall, Texas.
[02:46:41.292 --> 02:46:44.974]  Let's go ahead and take a call here from Wyatt in Maryland.
[02:46:44.994 --> 02:46:45.854]  Been holding patiently.
[02:46:45.894 --> 02:46:46.474]  Welcome, Wyatt.
[02:46:47.054 --> 02:46:47.655]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:46:47.675 --> 02:46:48.095]  Can you hear me?
[02:46:48.235 --> 02:46:48.495]  Yes, sir.
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:51.281]  Okay, I had to wait for an hour and a half to talk to you.
[02:46:52.382 --> 02:46:53.122]  Well, I'm sorry.
[02:46:53.483 --> 02:46:56.504]  Well, I know, but you said you were going to get to the phone a few different times.
[02:46:57.245 --> 02:46:57.765]  Okay, I can't.
[02:46:57.785 --> 02:46:58.125]  You know what?
[02:46:58.406 --> 02:46:59.346]  Thanks for the call, Wyatt.
[02:47:00.046 --> 02:47:00.987]  I'm just not going to take calls today.
[02:47:01.007 --> 02:47:01.307]  That's it.
[02:47:02.088 --> 02:47:02.668]  No more calls.
[02:47:03.468 --> 02:47:05.670]  In fact, I may just suspend calls, folks.
[02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:07.231]  I'm not bad.
[02:47:07.671 --> 02:47:07.991]  Okay?
[02:47:08.551 --> 02:47:10.693]  I say things, and you don't like me now, that's fine, too.
[02:47:11.593 --> 02:47:11.873]  Okay?
[02:47:12.314 --> 02:47:13.214]  We had a lady calling earlier.
[02:47:13.234 --> 02:47:14.435]  I gave her three minutes.
[02:47:15.195 --> 02:47:15.896]  I looked at the clock.
[02:47:15.956 --> 02:47:16.596]  Didn't interrupt her.
[02:47:17.153 --> 02:47:18.614]  And then she got mad, she wanted more time.
[02:47:18.634 --> 02:47:19.675]  And I know you probably hate my guts.
[02:47:19.935 --> 02:47:21.456]  Wife's been calling this show for 10 years.
[02:47:22.417 --> 02:47:23.037]  And I don't care.
[02:47:23.898 --> 02:47:25.359]  I just cannot put up with it anymore.
[02:47:25.399 --> 02:47:26.400]  I'm not gonna be chewed out.
[02:47:26.440 --> 02:47:27.341]  I'm not gonna be griped at.
[02:47:27.621 --> 02:47:28.822]  I know you're probably at work.
[02:47:29.102 --> 02:47:30.323]  And now you're all screwed up.
[02:47:30.583 --> 02:47:32.084]  And now you wasted all this time.
[02:47:32.264 --> 02:47:33.505]  And I'll never hear from you again.
[02:47:33.705 --> 02:47:34.466]  And c'est la vie.
[02:47:36.247 --> 02:47:36.467]  Okay?
[02:47:37.288 --> 02:47:37.948]  C'est la vie.
[02:47:38.509 --> 02:47:39.569]  Here's knowing you, kid.
[02:47:39.589 --> 02:47:41.671]  In fact, I got my apple juice right here.
[02:47:42.972 --> 02:47:43.953]  I'm gonna drink a toast.
[02:47:44.313 --> 02:47:45.594]  Bon voyage here!
[02:47:48.840 --> 02:47:50.561]  You can tell, folks, I'm pretty hyped up today.
[02:47:50.601 --> 02:47:53.483]  I'm really mad about all the things that are happening in this culture.
[02:47:53.943 --> 02:47:55.505]  We're going to hell in a handbasket.
[02:47:56.905 --> 02:47:59.947]  And I can only say thanks for holding and then, oh, I've been holding a long time.
[02:48:00.008 --> 02:48:00.888]  Okay, I'm sorry.
[02:48:01.168 --> 02:48:02.809]  Well, you said you were going to go to me.
[02:48:03.030 --> 02:48:04.471]  You said you were going to take calls.
[02:48:04.971 --> 02:48:07.793]  Gee, if you don't take my apology, it's fine.
[02:48:08.293 --> 02:48:10.134]  We just don't have to go there.
[02:48:10.154 --> 02:48:11.435]  In fact, sorry to all the other callers.
[02:48:11.475 --> 02:48:12.236]  I'm just not taking any.
[02:48:12.656 --> 02:48:14.497]  You know, there's a lot of news here I need to cover.
[02:48:15.278 --> 02:48:16.839]  And if you don't like the show, don't tune in.
[02:48:17.599 --> 02:48:18.500]  It's really simple.
[02:48:20.655 --> 02:48:22.716]  You know, I don't do this because I enjoy it.
[02:48:23.716 --> 02:48:27.537]  And I know I'm a big mouth and a loud mouth and it sounds like I run off at the mouth.
[02:48:27.997 --> 02:48:30.578]  It's not because I'm some arrogant bastard who's into himself.
[02:48:30.638 --> 02:48:31.398]  I'm not, folks.
[02:48:31.979 --> 02:48:32.699]  I study this.
[02:48:32.739 --> 02:48:33.739]  I'm upset about this.
[02:48:34.119 --> 02:48:37.440]  I'm here trying to do a job that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:37.700 --> 02:48:38.401]  Hello, my friends.

[02:48:53.866 --> 02:48:56.727]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.

[02:51:39.468 --> 02:51:40.188]  I get frustrated.
[02:51:40.228 --> 02:51:44.009]  I want to cover all this news and I'm so long-winded and I want to take the calls.
[02:51:44.169 --> 02:51:45.710]  And we can do like Coast to Coast AM does.
[02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:49.411]  We can do three hours with no callers and then do the last hour calls.
[02:51:50.571 --> 02:51:53.292]  Or do two and a half hours in the last 30 minutes of calls.
[02:51:53.552 --> 02:51:54.892]  Or we can take calls once a week.
[02:51:55.092 --> 02:51:58.453]  And I'm seriously considering going to that format.
[02:51:58.713 --> 02:52:00.554]  And then people won't have to complain about having to hold.
[02:52:01.634 --> 02:52:04.615]  By the way, Wyatt, I'm not trying to get on your bad side or get in a fight with you here.
[02:52:05.453 --> 02:52:11.157]  They put in the computer, when somebody calls, because their name is on the computer, you know, Wyatt, Maryland, what time they put your name there.
[02:52:11.337 --> 02:52:13.418]  You've been holding 45 minutes, not an hour and a half.
[02:52:14.338 --> 02:52:15.559]  Now see, this is important news.
[02:52:15.579 --> 02:52:16.500]  We're going to talk about it now.
[02:52:17.400 --> 02:52:29.828]  But seriously, all over the country, they're now taking one room cabins, you name it, and charging them upwards of seven times what they were being paid on property taxes, claiming that their view increases the value by that.
[02:52:30.328 --> 02:52:31.689]  A view of any type of wildlife.
[02:52:33.160 --> 02:52:36.981]  There's all these new scams where the government is just raping the living daylights out of us.
[02:52:37.661 --> 02:52:40.722]  Big Apple workers switch to RFID payments.
[02:52:41.202 --> 02:52:46.163]  TechWeb, after a long wait, computers, and commuters, yeah, computers, traveling.
[02:52:46.963 --> 02:52:51.985]  After a long wait, commuters, traveling between New Jersey and New York, could soon be using RFID technology.
[02:52:52.465 --> 02:52:54.145]  The board trains, oh!
[02:52:54.825 --> 02:53:01.227]  And see that dovetails with New York City subway bag searches, a federal case, CBS News!
[02:53:03.283 --> 02:53:06.704]  And, oh, is it legal to just search people randomly?
[02:53:06.744 --> 02:53:07.484]  Of course it's not.
[02:53:07.924 --> 02:53:11.625]  But they start on the planes, then the buses, then the streets.
[02:53:12.325 --> 02:53:20.987]  A Port Authority of New York and New Jersey voted four years ago to approve the project, but only began to establish guidelines for the use last spring.
[02:53:21.967 --> 02:53:25.688]  The PA plans to install readers in 13 stations by next spring.
[02:53:26.368 --> 02:53:29.729]  And you will have your own RFID card that tracks your name and
[02:53:30.842 --> 02:53:38.046]  goes back to your database and how much you put on the card and it just says it'll track everybody like the easy pass going down the roads.
[02:53:38.227 --> 02:53:39.447]  So see that there you go.
[02:53:39.968 --> 02:53:42.189]  We're about to have that here as well.
[02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:52.215]  Big article out of Knight Ridder News Service, ultra-violent atrocities saturate pop culture and yeah it's worse than ever.
[02:53:52.995 --> 02:53:57.118]  I mean I'll turn the TV on when I'm on the treadmill or the exercise bike
[02:53:58.673 --> 02:54:02.576]  And it is just wall-to-wall violence, just gratuitous.
[02:54:03.157 --> 02:54:05.939]  And again, it isn't that I can't handle the violence, I'm a wimp.
[02:54:06.359 --> 02:54:08.340]  It's that it just desensitizes.
[02:54:09.021 --> 02:54:13.624]  It's just... We know what it does, and this article gets into that.
[02:54:16.627 --> 02:54:19.229]  And how it's all being made to be a big joke.
[02:54:21.730 --> 02:54:22.831]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:54:23.972 --> 02:54:27.455]  Unbelievable to see all of this happening.
[02:54:28.772 --> 02:54:37.175]  It makes me very upset that our entire free society is not going to be free very, very soon.
[02:54:37.195 --> 02:54:44.557]  I mean, we are going in for the final stages, the final steps of enslavement.
[02:54:45.177 --> 02:54:50.438]  Doesn't matter what color you are or what religion you are, you're being enslaved.
[02:54:50.458 --> 02:54:52.019]  And our leaders are bought and paid for.
[02:54:52.822 --> 02:55:01.228]  And I'm sorry sometimes if I respect you so much, listeners, that I don't put on an act and I don't sit here and grovel and lick your boots and I don't expect you to do that to me.
[02:55:01.288 --> 02:55:03.830]  I don't want all the compliments and all the... I don't care.
[02:55:04.491 --> 02:55:05.251]  This is a fight.
[02:55:05.291 --> 02:55:06.672]  This is a life and death fight.
[02:55:06.692 --> 02:55:08.854]  And I really appreciate you, the listeners.
[02:55:08.894 --> 02:55:10.615]  I appreciate our affiliates.
[02:55:11.055 --> 02:55:12.336]  I appreciate our sponsors.
[02:55:12.376 --> 02:55:13.517]  I appreciate our callers.
[02:55:13.958 --> 02:55:18.361]  I appreciate John Harmon running the show right now, my radio producer, Violet Jones.
[02:55:19.021 --> 02:55:20.182]  I appreciate my crew.
[02:55:20.823 --> 02:55:21.243]  Everybody!
[02:55:22.578 --> 02:55:27.981]  And I'm thankful for the opportunity to be your host Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central and back from 9 to midnight.
[02:55:29.661 --> 02:55:31.362]  But I'm also not a punching bag.
[02:55:32.963 --> 02:55:35.524]  And so you can forget it.
[02:55:36.364 --> 02:55:37.825]  I'm not here to be harassed either.
[02:55:38.866 --> 02:55:40.826]  I'm not here to be trifled with.
[02:55:41.487 --> 02:55:42.407]  This is serious.
[02:55:42.447 --> 02:55:43.368]  This is a war.
[02:55:43.748 --> 02:55:44.628]  This isn't a game.

[02:56:00.248 --> 02:56:01.349]  This stuff is real.
[02:56:01.689 --> 02:56:02.750]  This isn't a game.
[02:56:03.130 --> 02:56:05.072]  Let's get our heads screwed on straight.
[02:56:05.512 --> 02:56:07.814]  Let's defend humanity from dehumanization.
[02:56:08.535 --> 02:56:09.596]  God bless you all.
[02:56:09.636 --> 02:56:11.157]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
