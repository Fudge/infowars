[00:00:05.854 --> 00:00:06.494]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.154 --> 00:00:08.235]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.935 --> 00:00:10.096]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.676 --> 00:00:11.557]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:13.138]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.158 --> 00:00:17.460]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.162]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.586]  All right, my friends, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:31.347]  It is the 11th day of May, 2005, on this live Wednesday edition...
[00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:38.638]  I really apologize that I wasn't here yesterday.
[00:00:38.678 --> 00:00:50.583]  I got into the office and... Well, the power was off because they were digging and had cut some lines somewhere in this area of Austin.
[00:00:51.283 --> 00:00:54.985]  So I was not with you yesterday and I was biting my lip.
[00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:57.906]  Believe me, I really wanted to get on air.
[00:00:57.966 --> 00:00:59.787]  But we are here, my friends.
[00:01:00.868 --> 00:01:04.109]  I should have a backup power system here in this office, but I mean...
[00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:08.308]  The power goes off a couple times a year, but usually for maybe 30 minutes or something.
[00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:10.150]  It might happen once a year while I'm on air.
[00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:16.694]  But I think I'm going to get a backup power system in here that will run for six hours and we won't have that problem.
[00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:22.158]  But I guess you don't do something about something until there is a problem.
[00:01:23.371 --> 00:01:31.395]  All right, it is Wednesday, the 11th day of May, and we have yesterday's news stacked up and today's news stacked up.
[00:01:31.955 --> 00:01:41.879]  Congressman Ron Paul has been very busy battling during this session, and one of his flights got delayed today or something, so he won't be joining us today.
[00:01:42.239 --> 00:01:46.961]  He will be joining us to talk about this new national ID card and what it really does.
[00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:52.664]  The Senate passed last night, but the House passed on Monday.
[00:01:54.173 --> 00:02:04.160]  We've got Declan McCullough from CNET News, also writes for a score of other major publications, joining us in the third hour to analyze it section by section.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.541]  Forget the rhetoric.
[00:02:05.601 --> 00:02:07.042]  Forget the stories you've heard.
[00:02:07.582 --> 00:02:11.225]  We'll go over what's actually in the final legislation.
[00:02:11.265 --> 00:02:12.386]  And believe me, it's scary.
[00:02:12.426 --> 00:02:15.428]  I've got it, the final text, right here in front of me.
[00:02:16.428 --> 00:02:21.552]  It's going to Lord Bush's desk as we speak here in the next few days.
[00:02:22.748 --> 00:02:31.770]  And we'll talk about the strategy that was used, very sophisticated, to manipulate the public, conservatives predominantly, into supporting the legislation.
[00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.211]  Population has bought into theater yet again.
[00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:45.892]  This is obviously a fake terror incident with Lord Bush and the hand grenade bouncing around.
[00:02:45.912 --> 00:02:49.393]  Turns out, of course, it was a fake incident.
[00:02:50.549 --> 00:03:03.237]  There were hand grenades, supposedly, that turned out to be toy bombs that blew up last week in a planter, in a plant container, and from the British Embassy on election morning.
[00:03:05.218 --> 00:03:06.118]  Same M.O.
[00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:08.139]  will be going over this.
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.081]  It's now come out from declassified U.S.
[00:03:10.121 --> 00:03:16.725]  government documents that clearly link the CIA to blowing up airplanes with bombs in them.
[00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:18.806]  Same M.O.,
[00:03:19.582 --> 00:03:26.207]  And of course, blaming it on terrorists as usual as a pretext to go after your freedoms.
[00:03:26.847 --> 00:03:35.434]  The federal government with some of these different states, California namely, wants to start regulating with a computer when you can have air conditioning.
[00:03:35.954 --> 00:03:43.800]  That meshes nicely with the government wants to tax you for eating, quote, unhealthy food and track and trace what you eat and what you drink and what you do.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.762]  Just total micromanagement, total control.
[00:03:47.563 --> 00:03:48.824]  We had the case a few days ago
[00:03:49.622 --> 00:03:55.605]  In Los Angeles, California, the police now, it was 120 bullets, now it's over 120.
[00:03:56.045 --> 00:03:57.686]  Some reports are over 200 bullets.
[00:03:59.007 --> 00:04:06.491]  Fired an unarmed man in a white SUV, and most of the bullets hit houses full of men, women, and children.
[00:04:07.011 --> 00:04:12.234]  And the only reason you're hearing about it, and the reason the cops are in trouble, is because they shot two of their own officers.
[00:04:13.317 --> 00:04:19.882]  I want to talk about this insane, bloodlust, attack dog, bloodthirsty mentality that's been drummed into them.
[00:04:20.503 --> 00:04:23.045]  So we'll be discussing that as well.
[00:04:23.085 --> 00:04:28.249]  There is just so much that we're going to plunge directly into.
[00:04:29.987 --> 00:04:48.816]  After this quick break, and then we'll take your calls right up until the third hour, when Declan McCullough, always an interesting and informative guest, CNET News technology writer, will be joining us to go over your new expanded national ID card that the illegal aliens are exempt from.
[00:04:49.824 --> 00:04:52.866]  And by the way, Lord Bush wants to pay for the illegal aliens' health care.
[00:04:53.327 --> 00:04:58.830]  Something citizens don't get, the illegals will get, and most of your governors are pushing to give them in-state tuition as well.
[00:04:59.051 --> 00:04:59.731]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:01.472 --> 00:05:05.795]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.975 --> 00:05:10.399]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:14.942]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.982 --> 00:05:16.323]  The New World Order.
[00:05:18.104 --> 00:05:22.329]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:29.317]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:29.457 --> 00:05:31.460]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:42.248]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:42.448 --> 00:05:47.813]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:50.955]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:05:50.975 --> 00:05:51.536]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.576 --> 00:05:52.096]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.116 --> 00:05:53.377]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:00.983 --> 00:06:04.286]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.306 --> 00:06:08.489]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.552]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.732 --> 00:06:14.134]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.314 --> 00:06:22.980]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.161 --> 00:06:24.522]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.702 --> 00:06:28.865]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[00:06:28.865 --> 00:06:29.505]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.886 --> 00:07:03.267]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:03.507 --> 00:07:07.349]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:08.489]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:13.011]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:17.453]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.813 --> 00:07:22.695]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:26.660]  Now, just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.207]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:32.468 --> 00:07:35.211]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:35.512 --> 00:07:36.393]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:36.693 --> 00:07:37.274]  Call now.
[00:07:37.294 --> 00:07:37.855]  1-800-CAL-BEN
[00:07:38.155 --> 00:07:47.421]  Call 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:49.202]  Call Cal-Ben toll free at 1-800-340-7091.
[00:07:49.242 --> 00:07:50.262]  That's 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[00:08:01.155 --> 00:08:08.900]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:10.581 --> 00:08:11.982]  Thank you again for joining us.
[00:08:13.383 --> 00:08:16.525]  It is Wednesday, the 11th day of May, 2005.
[00:08:16.625 --> 00:08:27.172]  We do have Declan McCullough from CNET News coming on to analyze the actual subsections of our new national ID card, the radically expanded national ID card that
[00:08:27.853 --> 00:08:31.074]  Well, we're now learning, is it going to be enforced against the illegal aliens?
[00:08:31.134 --> 00:08:38.735]  Well, that was in the bill to begin with, but now the so-called conservatives that were fooled as usual are going to have to realize that.
[00:08:38.855 --> 00:08:45.937]  They were sucked in by the fake leftist organizations that decried it as a racist bill that would stop the illegal aliens.
[00:08:45.977 --> 00:08:48.537]  Why, how dare you racist right-wingers?
[00:08:48.917 --> 00:08:50.838]  Our precious illegal aliens are wonderful.
[00:08:51.438 --> 00:08:57.579]  And you took the bait as usual and didn't read the actual bill, didn't listen to Ron Paul, didn't listen to this broadcast.
[00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:02.825]  Didn't read the actual analysis of it by many writers who studied it.
[00:09:03.426 --> 00:09:08.287]  You just believe the little set piece, little theater that was put on for you.
[00:09:09.928 --> 00:09:23.773]  Meanwhile, Bush is announcing that he will be paying for California and Texas and others, a small portion of it, a billion or so every month or so, for the illegal aliens and their health care.
[00:09:25.578 --> 00:09:38.711]  And many of the emergency rooms in California and Texas and Arizona and New Mexico and Colorado and Nevada are shutting down because the illegals show up in mass to have their babies.
[00:09:39.212 --> 00:09:40.253]  They instantly become U.S.
[00:09:40.293 --> 00:09:41.254]  citizens at that point.
[00:09:41.534 --> 00:09:42.175]  The child does.
[00:09:42.215 --> 00:09:43.156]  The parents get asylum.
[00:09:44.009 --> 00:09:48.453]  To have their cancer operated on, to have you name it.
[00:09:48.893 --> 00:09:56.600]  But I have personal friends who have degrees, who are American citizens, who have life-threatening illnesses.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.663]  One of them, Crohn's disease, he hasn't been able to eat for three weeks.
[00:10:00.703 --> 00:10:01.804]  He's lost a lot of weight.
[00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:06.087]  And he goes in and says, listen, I've only got $5,000 in the bank.
[00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:14.930]  Of the years I've saved, and it's basically, sorry, you don't get surgery, and you may just have to starve to death.
[00:10:16.371 --> 00:10:22.354]  He goes, well, can't I just check myself into the emergency room under Medicare or Medicaid?
[00:10:22.914 --> 00:10:28.497]  And nope, sorry, can't do that, but the illegals literally, folks, go right past me.
[00:10:29.558 --> 00:10:34.040]  And I cut my finger off almost completely about two years ago,
[00:10:35.189 --> 00:10:36.991]  Out helping some people when I was out fishing.
[00:10:37.031 --> 00:10:44.776]  I tried to jump onto the side of there in heavy waves to help get their pontoon boat started and slid off, and my hand got caught in the door.
[00:10:44.816 --> 00:10:47.479]  But that's pointless to go over the details.
[00:10:47.979 --> 00:11:03.671]  When I got to the hospital, which I shouldn't have even done, I had a friend with me, and we had called ahead on the cell phone to have an ambulance there, and we drove back into the dock, and the ambulance drove about 45 miles an hour, and I could have driven at about 80, or my friend could have,
[00:11:04.295 --> 00:11:05.696]  And he followed me in my truck.
[00:11:06.656 --> 00:11:11.318]  And I get there, and literally, the place is filled with illegal aliens.
[00:11:11.478 --> 00:11:15.380]  I guess it was Breckenridge I went to, the city hospital in downtown Austin.
[00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:20.382]  And I'm sitting there, literally hoping my finger doesn't die.
[00:11:21.943 --> 00:11:29.086]  All the skin's ripped off the bone, the bone's all exposed, and it's totally numb, and literally the finger's flopping around.
[00:11:31.207 --> 00:11:33.308]  And I'm actually...
[00:11:34.557 --> 00:11:35.598]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:11:51.665 --> 00:11:54.107]  And yes, yes, the people behind the counter, we know who you are.
[00:11:54.567 --> 00:11:59.591]  Well, I see people who claim they have stomach aches and stuff, these illegal aliens, going right in the door.
[00:11:59.831 --> 00:12:02.973]  I mean, they show up, they'd be there five minutes, right to the door.
[00:12:03.073 --> 00:12:04.294]  I said, let me in!
[00:12:04.634 --> 00:12:05.695]  Attach my finger!
[00:12:06.536 --> 00:12:06.856]  Now!
[00:12:08.863 --> 00:12:09.783]  And my dad went over.
[00:12:10.003 --> 00:12:11.183]  He's a dentist and oral surgeon.
[00:12:11.203 --> 00:12:12.584]  He gave him some of the doctor talk.
[00:12:12.624 --> 00:12:20.305]  And then this doctor comes bustling out who was all black circles around their eyes, busy working their hind ends off.
[00:12:20.465 --> 00:12:21.766]  A very good female surgeon.
[00:12:22.626 --> 00:12:28.487]  And she goes in and reattaches it and cleans it.
[00:12:28.607 --> 00:12:29.787]  It was numb for about a year.
[00:12:29.827 --> 00:12:32.848]  And thank God, almost all the feelings come out except right on the tip of my finger.
[00:12:33.208 --> 00:12:36.729]  But the point is that I have actually experienced this.
[00:12:37.309 --> 00:12:37.829]  You understand?
[00:12:37.909 --> 00:12:38.349]  I'm there.
[00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:43.102]  With blood pouring out of my hand with my finger flopping around.
[00:12:44.522 --> 00:12:54.444]  And I actually took the skin and wrapped it back around the finger and in the ambulance they weren't really helping much and was trying to cram it all back together and tie it back together myself.
[00:12:54.484 --> 00:12:59.385]  It didn't feel too good, but I wanted to keep my fingers so that was quite easy to do.
[00:12:59.405 --> 00:13:06.247]  It was kind of like I took all the skin off my finger like a glove and cracked the bone where it was flopping around.
[00:13:07.127 --> 00:13:07.287]  But...
[00:13:09.053 --> 00:13:09.874]  I'll never forget that.
[00:13:10.334 --> 00:13:11.735]  Looking at that purple bone.
[00:13:11.755 --> 00:13:13.135]  It was like purple-pink.
[00:13:13.175 --> 00:13:15.757]  It was kind of pretty, just that little... You know, because your finger bones are little.
[00:13:16.137 --> 00:13:26.683]  Looking at that thing flopping around, it was... And I don't mean the blood and the skin was pretty, but the bone, you think a bone is being white because you always see it when it's dead, you know, bleached out on the side of the road.
[00:13:27.184 --> 00:13:28.284]  But it was all... It was purple.
[00:13:29.065 --> 00:13:33.668]  And anyways, now, see how I image things in my mind and try to describe what I'm seeing?
[00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.969]  I always get into too much detail and...
[00:13:36.903 --> 00:13:41.704]  I always seem to rant at the beginning of the broadcast instead of getting into all the news, as I promised I would do.
[00:13:43.004 --> 00:13:52.066]  But you have these overworked doctors, and you have the city taxpayers and state taxpayers, and they also get federal grants paying for this.
[00:13:53.866 --> 00:13:57.427]  And I even had an insurance card in my wallet.
[00:13:59.187 --> 00:14:03.708]  And so if they know you've got insurance, they run the insurance, they check it,
[00:14:04.361 --> 00:14:06.683]  I guess the computer tells them what to charge you.
[00:14:07.103 --> 00:14:11.686]  You get charged many times what people who are destitute do, and I think that's proper.
[00:14:12.586 --> 00:14:18.150]  But the illegal aliens, they know that they don't have any ID or any proof, so they just go to the front of the line.
[00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:20.572]  They go to the front of the line.
[00:14:21.072 --> 00:14:28.997]  I've talked about how I know an apartment manager who manages the biggest property in Austin for the biggest property management company in the country.
[00:14:29.577 --> 00:14:33.480]  About two years ago, she talked about a Christmas week meeting they had in Dallas where
[00:14:34.221 --> 00:14:48.564]  In a ballroom with hundreds of their top managers, and they told them, we have secretly been taken over by the federal government, not because we're insolvent, but because if the government takes over one-third of our housing, we don't have to pay taxes, basically, anymore.
[00:14:49.124 --> 00:14:56.485]  But we don't want our clients to know we've been taken over by the government, and these are mid-level and high-level apartments, nice apartments, and golf courses.
[00:14:56.545 --> 00:14:59.886]  It's a bunch of properties, but this was dealing with the apartments.
[00:15:00.938 --> 00:15:03.340]  Let illegals have ten people to a room.
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:09.465]  But if citizens even have family visiting for more than a week, find them and then kick them out.
[00:15:09.505 --> 00:15:12.547]  We want to move them out and move illegals in.
[00:15:14.628 --> 00:15:16.310]  This is our deal with the federal government.
[00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:18.451]  You understand, folks?
[00:15:18.571 --> 00:15:20.773]  I mean, I have a personal, lifelong friend.
[00:15:21.607 --> 00:15:23.089]  Who's known me since I was three years old.
[00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:23.989]  Okay?
[00:15:24.390 --> 00:15:28.053]  I mean, she told me personally this story, and she couldn't believe it.
[00:15:28.654 --> 00:15:30.896]  She was told it was a government operation.
[00:15:31.997 --> 00:15:33.719]  You understand the magnitude of that?
[00:15:34.119 --> 00:15:42.848]  Designed, ladies and gentlemen, to bring down the borders, designed to destroy our sovereignty, designed to annihilate our wages.
[00:15:44.725 --> 00:15:56.252]  And so is it any surprise to you that Bush comes out and says, I'm going to pay the states to take care of the illegal aliens at the hospitals?
[00:15:56.872 --> 00:15:58.213]  Something you don't get.
[00:15:58.433 --> 00:16:01.735]  I have a friend who has Crohn's disease.
[00:16:01.755 --> 00:16:03.876]  That's where your intestines inflate.
[00:16:04.977 --> 00:16:06.238]  You can't pass food.
[00:16:06.698 --> 00:16:10.320]  You literally start having an autoimmune response to food you eat.
[00:16:11.102 --> 00:16:17.949]  He's losing a lot of weight, he's a good friend of mine, and he cannot get the surgery.
[00:16:17.969 --> 00:16:20.111]  Do you understand that?
[00:16:21.052 --> 00:16:23.254]  He's trying to set up payment plans with them.
[00:16:23.755 --> 00:16:25.376]  Oh, I promise I'll pay you.
[00:16:25.837 --> 00:16:29.340]  I'll give you everything I've got, the $5,000 I've got.
[00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:34.365]  But if he's an illegal alien, ladies and gentlemen, he goes right to the head of the line.
[00:16:35.313 --> 00:16:40.414]  They're having mass surgeries, complex surgeries, every day in major cities.
[00:16:40.894 --> 00:16:44.735]  In some major cities, hundreds of them a week for these illegal aliens.
[00:16:44.795 --> 00:16:46.035]  Whatever they need.
[00:16:46.435 --> 00:16:47.475]  Brain surgery.
[00:16:48.435 --> 00:16:49.976]  Lung surgery.
[00:16:50.476 --> 00:16:51.816]  Liver transplants.
[00:16:51.976 --> 00:16:53.176]  Just lavish.
[00:16:54.857 --> 00:16:56.257]  And I don't have to hear it from him.
[00:16:56.917 --> 00:16:58.397]  I don't have to read about it in the newspaper.
[00:16:59.057 --> 00:17:00.438]  I have experienced it.
[00:17:01.398 --> 00:17:02.858]  And if I wouldn't have thrown a fit...
[00:17:03.736 --> 00:17:04.916]  And I wasn't a fit.
[00:17:04.956 --> 00:17:08.217]  I very coldly leaned over the counter and said, get your manager now.
[00:17:08.577 --> 00:17:09.958]  I've been sitting here for too long.
[00:17:11.178 --> 00:17:14.099]  You get me in there and you reattach my finger now, you're going to be liable.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.881]  And said, don't think that I don't see all these illegal aliens going right past me into the door.
[00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:21.361]  Don't think I don't.
[00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:22.261]  I've got money.
[00:17:22.882 --> 00:17:24.282]  I'm willing to pay for this.
[00:17:24.982 --> 00:17:26.083]  I've got insurance.
[00:17:26.603 --> 00:17:28.043]  And I'm sitting here.
[00:17:29.524 --> 00:17:29.764]  All right.
[00:17:30.324 --> 00:17:30.824]  We are...
[00:17:31.644 --> 00:17:33.845]  Folks, you're a second-class citizen if you've got insurance.
[00:17:34.165 --> 00:17:35.506]  The illegal aliens are first-class.
[00:17:37.486 --> 00:17:43.529]  And if you are somebody who doesn't have insurance and you're an American citizen, you're a third-class individual.
[00:17:44.509 --> 00:17:45.690]  Third-class.
[00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.110]  There's no other way to describe it.
[00:17:47.370 --> 00:17:55.494]  And you've heard about all these governors, Republicans, Democrats, Senator Orrin Hatch, Bush, they want in-state tuition for illegal aliens.
[00:17:55.934 --> 00:17:59.115]  In fact, California and Oregon give double
[00:17:59.907 --> 00:18:04.730]  The funds to illegal aliens and quote immigrants than citizens get.
[00:18:05.331 --> 00:18:07.953]  Because it's designed to get more of them here.
[00:18:08.253 --> 00:18:11.235]  Look at Bush's amnesty plan that he's been trying to pass.
[00:18:12.956 --> 00:18:15.178]  Quote to fix the immigration problem.
[00:18:15.198 --> 00:18:16.399]  Yes, it'll totally legalize.
[00:18:16.459 --> 00:18:18.580]  It'll fix the problem because they'll just legalize it.
[00:18:20.566 --> 00:18:23.087]  For six years, anybody who's here is totally legal.
[00:18:23.127 --> 00:18:25.108]  Anybody who can get here becomes totally legal.
[00:18:25.649 --> 00:18:27.029]  Instantly, no questions asked.
[00:18:27.370 --> 00:18:33.973]  And it allows these corporations to not just bring skilled, but unskilled workers in at unlimited levels.
[00:18:35.574 --> 00:18:36.915]  Unlimited.
[00:18:37.335 --> 00:18:39.496]  900 plus thousand legals a year already.
[00:18:39.516 --> 00:18:41.877]  3 million illegals a year coming in.
[00:18:42.057 --> 00:18:43.338]  That's almost 4 million.
[00:18:43.358 --> 00:18:43.338]  3,900,000.
[00:18:43.638 --> 00:18:44.599]  That's the Fed's own numbers.
[00:18:47.418 --> 00:18:48.679]  And that isn't enough for them.
[00:18:49.099 --> 00:18:53.201]  We've got to give them more goodies and more treats and more things.
[00:18:53.421 --> 00:18:56.122]  When we've got a bunch of senior citizens eating dog food.
[00:18:58.463 --> 00:19:00.804]  When we've got this country falling apart.
[00:19:03.006 --> 00:19:04.546]  It's unbelievable.
[00:19:07.027 --> 00:19:08.088]  All right, now I'm ranting.
[00:19:08.948 --> 00:19:10.308]  Here it is out of New York Times.
[00:19:10.388 --> 00:19:10.649]  U.S.
[00:19:10.689 --> 00:19:14.470]  pays for care of illegal aliens, treatment money for border states.
[00:19:14.890 --> 00:19:20.912]  The Bush administration said yesterday that it would start paying hospitals and doctors for providing emergency care to illegal immigrants.
[00:19:21.392 --> 00:19:22.812]  Because the hospitals are just shutting down.
[00:19:24.673 --> 00:19:29.354]  The money, totaling $1 billion, will be available for services provided today through September.
[00:19:30.757 --> 00:19:33.138]  Folks, it's a lot more than that.
[00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:39.442]  Congress provided the money as part of the 2003 law that expanded Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
[00:19:39.462 --> 00:19:42.124]  The new payments have nothing to do with the Medicare program.
[00:19:43.144 --> 00:19:58.233]  So, my friend may end up looking like a concentration camp victim because he can't eat, but the illegals are going to get everything they want while they cough their tuberculosis on us and their whooping cough and their meningitis.
[00:19:58.694 --> 00:19:59.354]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:03.357 --> 00:20:05.698]  Hi folks, Jack Browning from Midas Resources.
[00:20:05.958 --> 00:20:07.039]  The real money folks.
[00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.261]  Let's review a few things from the past year.
[00:20:12.741 --> 00:20:13.742]  November 2003 to November 2004.
[00:20:13.802 --> 00:20:15.023]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300.
[00:20:15.143 --> 00:20:15.663]  A 5% increase.
[00:20:16.263 --> 00:20:18.624]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro.
[00:20:18.664 --> 00:20:21.886]  A 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[00:20:31.596 --> 00:20:37.220]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[00:20:37.821 --> 00:20:40.863]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[00:22:01.556 --> 00:22:02.718]  Why do you wear watches?
[00:22:02.998 --> 00:22:05.622]  The answer is no longer simply to tell time.
[00:22:06.083 --> 00:22:13.754]  At discountwatchstore.com, watches are as much about telling time as they are about making a fashion statement or showing off one's success.
[00:22:14.134 --> 00:22:17.880]  Watches also make for great heirlooms to pass on for generations to come.

[00:24:07.108 --> 00:24:19.320]  The next group of articles I was going to get into is fake terror alerts, and obviously many of you now know, about 15 minutes ago, they started evacuating the U.S.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.905]  Capitol, claiming that there was an airplane in the area off course.
[00:24:23.945 --> 00:24:30.672]  Turns out, it's a small plane that just got a little bit off course in the most controlled airspace in the world, Washington, D.C.,
[00:24:31.781 --> 00:24:37.244]  And always in the past, if a plane got off course, they would launch F-16s and have them on the plane in minutes.
[00:24:37.264 --> 00:24:41.687]  But on 9-11, they stood down because Dick Cheney was in control of the, quote, war games.
[00:24:42.508 --> 00:24:54.635]  And it says that the Capitol Police and others screamed at people, pulled out shotguns and machine guns, told everybody to get down in the basement, told everyone to run for their lives, basically.
[00:24:54.655 --> 00:24:58.858]  And then, oh, false alarm, it was just a small plane off course.
[00:25:01.244 --> 00:25:04.247]  And this is just the classic fear-mongering that we see.
[00:25:06.149 --> 00:25:08.772]  Over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:25:10.994 --> 00:25:19.062]  Until the real date coming up in the future, unless we expose them and stop them, when the globalists really carry out a real terror attack that dwarfs 9-11.
[00:25:20.364 --> 00:25:21.585]  This is from the BBC.
[00:25:21.905 --> 00:25:23.167]  Cuba plane bomber?
[00:25:23.407 --> 00:25:24.468]  Who should we really worry about?
[00:25:25.057 --> 00:25:26.139]  Cuba plane bomber.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:31.908]  What is this, like the 50th story I've seen lately where the government admits they were carrying out terror attacks or planning them?
[00:25:32.629 --> 00:25:35.013]  Cuban plane bomber was CIA agent.
[00:25:35.353 --> 00:25:35.454]  Oh!
[00:25:37.205 --> 00:25:42.110]  And then we have a flashback at the top of the BBC article, the Hegelian dialectic in history, Operation Northwoods.
[00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:47.916]  The CIA pays people to bomb planes, but of course they'd never be involved in anything like 9-11.
[00:25:48.276 --> 00:25:49.157]  It's out of the question.
[00:25:49.197 --> 00:25:49.838]  That's our comment.
[00:25:50.238 --> 00:25:51.219]  Ignore Northwoods.
[00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:52.721]  Ignore the drills in the morning of 9-11.
[00:25:53.021 --> 00:25:55.363]  Ignore the past history of our government would never harm us.
[00:25:55.884 --> 00:25:56.725]  Declassified U.S.
[00:25:56.745 --> 00:25:57.465]  government documents.
[00:25:57.666 --> 00:25:58.907]  Now, this is the BBC article.
[00:26:00.299 --> 00:26:02.340]  A Cuba plane bomber was CIA agent.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.400]  Declassified U.S.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:10.263]  government documents show that a man suspected of involvement in the bombing of a Cuban passenger plane worked for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[00:26:10.623 --> 00:26:17.446]  Luis Podesta Carriles, a Cuban-born Venezuelan and anti-Castro dissident, was an agent and informer.
[00:26:18.127 --> 00:26:23.409]  The papers also reveal that an FBI informer all but admitted that, and that's the document, that Mr. Podesta...
[00:26:24.501 --> 00:26:29.847]  Posada, excuse me, was one of those behind the 1976 bombing that killed 73 people.
[00:26:30.347 --> 00:26:35.252]  Mr. Posada, who denies any involvement, is said to be seeking asylum in the U.S.
[00:26:35.272 --> 00:26:39.236]  His lawyers said his client, thought to be hiding in Miami area, deserves U.S.
[00:26:39.276 --> 00:26:42.199]  protection because of his long years of service to the country.
[00:26:42.399 --> 00:26:42.599]  Oh!
[00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:44.141]  U.S.
[00:26:44.181 --> 00:26:45.943]  officials say they have no evidence that Mr. Posada
[00:26:46.613 --> 00:26:52.719]  Posada is in the country, and added that they would deal with an asylum application from him as they would any other.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:54.001]  No conviction.
[00:26:54.882 --> 00:27:09.817]  The documents released by George Washington University's National Security Archive show that Mr. Posada, now in his 1970s, was a CIA payroll, CIA from the 1960s until mid-'76 when the bombing took place.
[00:27:10.456 --> 00:27:21.881]  One FBI report quoted a confidential source as saying that Mr. Posada was one of several people who met at least twice at a hotel in Caracas, allegedly to discuss bombing a Cuban Airlines plane.
[00:27:22.401 --> 00:27:27.524]  The report recommended that no action be taken on the information as it would compromise its sources.
[00:27:27.864 --> 00:27:33.406]  Mr. Posada was arrested in Venezuela after the bombing, but was not convicted before he escaped from prison.
[00:27:33.746 --> 00:27:35.047]  That is, let him out the front door.
[00:27:35.607 --> 00:27:35.947]  The U.S.
[00:27:35.988 --> 00:27:48.718]  documents show that he later went to Central America, where he joined the covert operation for the U.S., led by Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, to remain and rearm the anti-communist Contra Gorillas.
[00:27:49.819 --> 00:27:54.163]  And it turned into a big diplomatic fight in the 1990s, on and on and on.
[00:27:54.883 --> 00:27:55.564]  And here's the U.S.
[00:27:55.584 --> 00:27:56.425]  government documents.
[00:27:56.545 --> 00:27:57.906]  CIA officer...
[00:27:59.286 --> 00:28:02.807]  Folks, we have Operation Gladio declassified, where the U.S.
[00:28:02.867 --> 00:28:17.312]  government actually carried out over a hundred bombings in ten years, up into the late 1970s in Europe, blowing up school buses, trains, shooting people, and blaming it on the communists.
[00:28:17.352 --> 00:28:22.874]  Now, again, the communists are controlled by the same global system.
[00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:26.976]  But when low-level communists that aren't controlled start getting a little bit of power...
[00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:30.707]  That's how they turned our military to the dark side.
[00:28:31.107 --> 00:28:34.889]  It was the military carrying out Gladio, Army Intelligence and others.
[00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:38.252]  They'd say, men, we've got to fight the commies.
[00:28:38.632 --> 00:28:41.814]  We've got to be more hardcore than them to defend America.
[00:28:42.294 --> 00:28:45.036]  Yes, sir, I'll carry out the plastic explosive bombing.
[00:28:45.836 --> 00:28:50.219]  I don't like blowing up that bus with little kids, but I'll do it to fight the commies.
[00:28:51.184 --> 00:28:58.148]  Meanwhile, our government was building the oil refineries and funding them and shipping them just millions of tons of grain over the years.
[00:28:58.528 --> 00:28:59.289]  Millions of tons.
[00:28:59.909 --> 00:29:04.812]  Giving them all the weapon systems, the computer systems, the aluminum plant parts, everything.
[00:29:04.852 --> 00:29:05.693]  It's all staged.
[00:29:06.153 --> 00:29:12.797]  But they used that fake threat of communism that they created as a pretext to turn America into a police state.
[00:29:15.438 --> 00:29:18.080]  And meanwhile, hand grenade found at Bush rally.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:19.621]  That was the headline yesterday and
[00:29:20.825 --> 00:29:24.987]  By today, oh, it was a fake hand grenade that the government uses for drills.
[00:29:25.867 --> 00:29:27.608]  And it was a government agent that found it.
[00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:31.070]  But still, it shows the threat our president's under.
[00:29:31.510 --> 00:29:35.092]  Yes, terrorists would throw a dummy hand grenade at the president.
[00:29:35.512 --> 00:29:38.293]  And then, it's just so ridiculous.
[00:29:38.553 --> 00:29:47.357]  It's just like the toy bombing, the firecracker bombing last week at the British Embassy in New York right as the election started.
[00:29:47.697 --> 00:29:48.978]  I mean, it's the same stuff.
[00:29:52.017 --> 00:29:52.899]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.024]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.926 --> 00:29:58.612]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:04.056 --> 00:30:09.521]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:30:09.961 --> 00:30:14.184]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:30:14.425 --> 00:30:21.470]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:30:21.851 --> 00:30:27.956]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:30:27.996 --> 00:30:29.317]  There are no side effects.
[00:30:29.497 --> 00:30:29.977]  We're good to go.
[00:30:30.017 --> 00:30:30.497]  We're good to go.

[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:09.726]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.987 --> 00:31:14.350]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.

[00:31:27.660 --> 00:31:32.708]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.989 --> 00:31:39.700]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:31:40.194 --> 00:31:40.874]  What about you?

[00:33:02.417 --> 00:33:07.538]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.218 --> 00:33:10.559]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:11.959 --> 00:33:13.259]  Look, we need to get this straight.
[00:33:13.579 --> 00:33:21.081]  We have the bona fide, certified, declassified, directly from the U.S.
[00:33:21.121 --> 00:33:21.541]  government...
[00:33:22.216 --> 00:33:41.246]  Operation Northwoods, Gladio, we have the operations in England, now declassified to carry out terror bombings against their own population, to get the public to submit to tyranny, we have their own agents going public, we have Putin blowing up buildings, carrying out theater sieges, the Bislon massacres, all of it.
[00:33:41.807 --> 00:33:42.807]  Who stands to gain from it?
[00:33:42.827 --> 00:33:43.507]  Who has the motive?
[00:33:43.527 --> 00:33:44.868]  Who gets to take control of our lives?
[00:33:45.188 --> 00:33:46.329]  Who gets to be our masters?
[00:33:46.369 --> 00:33:47.930]  Who gets to engage in all this criminality?
[00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:49.971]  Because it's for our own good, to keep us safe.
[00:33:51.795 --> 00:33:52.836]  And just more and more of these.
[00:33:52.876 --> 00:33:55.618]  I mean, every week the government comes out with new documents.
[00:33:55.698 --> 00:33:57.299]  Okay, we're carrying out terror attacks.
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.441]  Okay, we're behind the Lockerbie bombing.
[00:33:59.821 --> 00:34:00.882]  Okay, we're behind this.
[00:34:00.902 --> 00:34:01.563]  We're behind that.
[00:34:01.603 --> 00:34:02.363]  What you going to do?
[00:34:03.944 --> 00:34:06.967]  But, oh, now they totally admit, yes, it was a false alarm.
[00:34:06.987 --> 00:34:08.188]  It was the little plane.
[00:34:08.648 --> 00:34:11.170]  Got a little bit off course this morning over D.C.
[00:34:12.551 --> 00:34:14.412]  I guess it would be this afternoon over D.C.
[00:34:14.452 --> 00:34:15.153]  in Eastern time.
[00:34:15.925 --> 00:34:18.126]  And they had to evacuate.
[00:34:18.146 --> 00:34:21.528]  We had to train the capitol to do what the nice men with the machine guns say.
[00:34:21.588 --> 00:34:28.151]  And the capitol's passed the doomsday bill to give up all their authority to the Lord Bush or whoever comes after him.
[00:34:28.211 --> 00:34:31.393]  And we're just all learning how to be good little slaves here.
[00:34:31.453 --> 00:34:34.654]  And we've got all the nice martial law legislation passed.
[00:34:34.735 --> 00:34:36.535]  And everything's fine now.
[00:34:38.156 --> 00:34:38.857]  We can all go back.
[00:34:38.897 --> 00:34:41.398]  And, you know, a fake hand grenade got thrown at the president.
[00:34:42.338 --> 00:34:44.859]  And of course, you know, see, that shows how brave he is.
[00:34:45.519 --> 00:34:50.681]  Oh, of course, the crowds broke through the barricades to worship him in Georgia.
[00:34:50.981 --> 00:34:53.642]  You know what would happen if our crowds broke through to worship him?
[00:34:53.702 --> 00:34:56.444]  They would fire with rubber bullets and probably rounds.
[00:34:56.804 --> 00:35:02.566]  He'd probably have a Tiananmen Square with 500 dead Americans, and the media would go, well, they had to to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:35:03.406 --> 00:35:06.287]  See, they had to, because that grenade could have been real.
[00:35:06.948 --> 00:35:10.309]  But no, in Georgia, they didn't stop the crowds worshiping Bush.
[00:35:12.205 --> 00:35:13.525]  Oh, Bush, you're so good.
[00:35:13.545 --> 00:35:15.046]  You give us such freedom.
[00:35:16.807 --> 00:35:18.027]  You love Putin.
[00:35:18.067 --> 00:35:19.967]  You celebrate at Red Square.
[00:35:20.048 --> 00:35:39.254]  Your goose-stepping soldiers march by you in a loving way, and you wear the little red flower because you're so good, and the men march by with their hammers and sickles, and Putin sets up regional governors, but we can trust you.
[00:35:39.614 --> 00:35:40.514]  You're a good man.
[00:35:42.638 --> 00:35:46.220]  And just going back over this, first it's grenade thrown, grenade thrown.
[00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:48.441]  It was providence, the preacher said.
[00:35:48.461 --> 00:35:49.662]  It was of the Lord.
[00:35:49.762 --> 00:35:52.243]  God stopped it from exploding.
[00:35:52.303 --> 00:35:53.303]  I said the same thing with Hitler.
[00:35:53.323 --> 00:35:55.084]  He'd have fake bombing attempts on him.
[00:35:55.744 --> 00:35:57.285]  It happened a bunch.
[00:35:57.305 --> 00:36:03.368]  It came out in mainstream news that Musharraf, the dictator of Pakistan, U.S.
[00:36:03.428 --> 00:36:07.310]  installed, had a stage bombing an hour after he passed a bridge.
[00:36:07.350 --> 00:36:07.830]  It blew up.
[00:36:08.491 --> 00:36:09.551]  Oh, see, he's under attack.
[00:36:09.571 --> 00:36:10.872]  You've got to take all your rights away.
[00:36:12.335 --> 00:36:15.136]  It's a classic M.O., modus operandi.
[00:36:15.196 --> 00:36:17.016]  Same story over and over again.
[00:36:18.337 --> 00:36:22.598]  The terrorists threw a fake hand grenade that the government uses for terror drills.
[00:36:25.859 --> 00:36:27.479]  It's so ridiculous.
[00:36:27.499 --> 00:36:30.580]  The grenade near Bush was a training device.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:32.921]  A grenade found close to where U.S.
[00:36:32.941 --> 00:36:37.522]  President George Bush addressed thousands of people in Georgia's capital was a non-explosive training device.
[00:36:38.214 --> 00:36:50.464]  Gaila Bezhavali, Secretary of Georgia's National Security Council, said Wednesday the device was a so-called engineering grenade found in inactive mode, CNN reported.
[00:36:50.484 --> 00:37:06.837]  The device was found Tuesday afternoon in Freedom Square in Tbilisi after Bush and Georgian President Mikhail Shakaveli drew cheers in their speeches about the U.S.-Georgia alliance and friendship.
[00:37:09.105 --> 00:37:09.365]  Right?
[00:37:09.405 --> 00:37:11.826]  Founder Bush was dud, Georgian official says.
[00:37:11.846 --> 00:37:15.287]  When you read into it, it wasn't a dud, it was a smoke bomb.
[00:37:15.867 --> 00:37:17.828]  A training granado.
[00:37:21.069 --> 00:37:37.175]  It's like before the anthrax ever got mailed, and we found the 99th Congressional Study, a million dollar study to study how to mail weaponized index to the mail, there were hundreds of federal courthouses and county courthouses that got mailed, or in secure floors, someone would
[00:37:38.126 --> 00:37:40.629]  Without a postage stamp, would just drop it in the elevator.
[00:37:41.209 --> 00:37:43.291]  And of course, they'd never look at the surveillance camera tapes.
[00:37:43.331 --> 00:37:44.172]  No one ever got in trouble.
[00:37:44.552 --> 00:37:46.955]  A few times it came out that, yes, it was part of drills.
[00:37:46.995 --> 00:37:48.036]  That did come out a few times.
[00:37:48.416 --> 00:37:50.078]  But 90 plus percent of the time it didn't.
[00:37:50.458 --> 00:37:57.946]  The government did release it, just fake yellow powder with anthrax written, just to test the responsiveness.
[00:37:59.412 --> 00:38:11.419]  And here in Austin in 1999 and 2000, we had a fake nuclear spill on I-35 in Kyle, south of Austin, five hours after they announced one time, very quickly on the TV stations, it was just an Army drill.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:15.121]  But to this day, most Austinites think it was a nuclear spill.
[00:38:15.562 --> 00:38:17.363]  They practiced the military shutting down the highway.
[00:38:18.003 --> 00:38:24.507]  And then a few days later, a few weeks later, had a shutdown of downtown Austin, and the police were out, and it turned out it was all a drill.
[00:38:25.581 --> 00:38:26.682]  I said that the day of the event.
[00:38:26.742 --> 00:38:30.585]  Mike Hanson got out there with a camera from an overpass inside the lockdown area.
[00:38:30.625 --> 00:38:31.826]  He happened to be inside it when it happened.
[00:38:31.846 --> 00:38:39.112]  They shut down most of downtown and videotaped him shaking hands and slapping the back of the guy that had a crew cut, supposedly a Muslim.
[00:38:39.372 --> 00:38:40.974]  He had a Koran in the back of his car.
[00:38:41.274 --> 00:38:43.036]  The media was allowed to come up and videotape it.
[00:38:43.596 --> 00:38:45.277]  Oh, look, there's a Koran in the back of the car.
[00:38:45.638 --> 00:38:48.400]  Two officers opened the back trunk and became mysteriously ill.
[00:38:49.821 --> 00:38:51.142]  It came out two days later.
[00:38:51.282 --> 00:38:52.223]  It was just a drill.
[00:38:53.424 --> 00:38:54.425]  They shut down Austin.
[00:38:56.587 --> 00:38:57.468]  Most of downtown.
[00:38:59.089 --> 00:39:00.530]  And I had a guy with a crew cut out.
[00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.490]  We got the video of him.
[00:39:01.911 --> 00:39:03.172]  They wouldn't let our cameras get close.
[00:39:03.192 --> 00:39:05.893]  They let the media get up right close and show the Koran.
[00:39:05.933 --> 00:39:07.034]  And what happened?
[00:39:07.054 --> 00:39:09.336]  The officers got sick after opening the trunk.
[00:39:09.636 --> 00:39:10.537]  Turned out it was fake.
[00:39:10.557 --> 00:39:11.237]  The cops knew it.
[00:39:11.277 --> 00:39:12.038]  They pulled it over.
[00:39:12.298 --> 00:39:13.799]  Part of a drill to scare us.
[00:39:14.528 --> 00:39:19.170]  Then a week later, GPS offices on North Lamar shut down.
[00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:23.211]  Two women first got sick, then over 100 had to go to the hospital.
[00:39:23.552 --> 00:39:25.252]  Bio-attack, bio-attack.
[00:39:25.332 --> 00:39:25.953]  What happened?
[00:39:26.233 --> 00:39:27.473]  Was it a bio-attack?
[00:39:28.394 --> 00:39:28.914]  I went down.
[00:39:28.974 --> 00:39:29.954]  It's in Road to Tyranny.
[00:39:30.294 --> 00:39:33.576]  Ran onto the live newscast, began screaming, it's all fake, stage-managed event.
[00:39:34.176 --> 00:39:42.059]  And I, riding in my car in front of witnesses, Mike Hanson and another cameraman, I called a local ABC affiliate and I bluffed them.
[00:39:42.859 --> 00:39:44.039]  I said, I know this is a drill.
[00:39:44.079 --> 00:39:45.060]  Admit it to me right now.
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:45.740]  Admit it.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:46.400]  I'm going public.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:48.240]  They said, let me get you a manager.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.941]  The manager got on, well, Mr. Jones, yeah, you better announce this is a drill, because I know it's a drill.
[00:39:53.902 --> 00:39:57.923]  And then a few hours later, oh, it was just, it might have been a drill, drill, drill.
[00:39:58.523 --> 00:40:00.503]  Folks, it's time for this to stop.
[00:40:03.744 --> 00:40:04.564]  It's disgusting.
[00:40:05.565 --> 00:40:07.465]  Again, it's in Road to Tyranny.
[00:40:07.985 --> 00:40:11.666]  I was up in Belton, just south of Kemple.
[00:40:12.814 --> 00:40:16.797]  And we knew it was going to be an urban warfare drill.
[00:40:17.398 --> 00:40:18.559]  We got up early in the morning.
[00:40:18.619 --> 00:40:20.300]  Troops walk over and say, what are you doing here?
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:21.281]  You're Alex Jones.
[00:40:21.561 --> 00:40:24.083]  Are you the people the videotape does at a checkpoint on I-35?
[00:40:24.163 --> 00:40:25.064]  A real checkpoint.
[00:40:25.264 --> 00:40:26.185]  We have video of that, too.
[00:40:26.465 --> 00:40:27.686]  As they're talking about it, we show the video.
[00:40:28.847 --> 00:40:30.088]  Where the cops came over again.
[00:40:30.869 --> 00:40:31.929]  And what was it?
[00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:33.130]  Captain Smart.
[00:40:33.971 --> 00:40:35.132]  And told us, you know, what are you doing?
[00:40:35.152 --> 00:40:35.832]  What are you doing over here?
[00:40:35.852 --> 00:40:36.353]  You can't film.
[00:40:37.188 --> 00:40:40.473]  Well, these troops run over, regular army, and start getting in our face.
[00:40:40.893 --> 00:40:41.895]  So we get back in their face.
[00:40:42.435 --> 00:40:46.141]  Then we go to the mayor's press conference, and he announces, today terrorists attacked us.
[00:40:46.842 --> 00:40:49.846]  And he's announcing there's been a terror attack, and at the end says it's just a drill.
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:54.362]  But the newspaper then writes an article about it, and at the last paragraph says it was a drill.
[00:40:54.642 --> 00:40:56.203]  But it has a psychological effect.
[00:40:56.223 --> 00:40:58.384]  People read the newspaper that a terrorist attacked.
[00:40:58.664 --> 00:41:02.927]  And then they, again, that was the next day, they blow up two cars.
[00:41:03.007 --> 00:41:04.007]  I mean, I've got video of it.
[00:41:04.047 --> 00:41:06.148]  They throw firebombs in them.
[00:41:06.188 --> 00:41:08.690]  They explode in downtown Belton.
[00:41:09.110 --> 00:41:10.391]  Don't tell people what it is.
[00:41:11.691 --> 00:41:12.832]  They explode.
[00:41:14.426 --> 00:41:16.427]  Fire shoots out 15 feet.
[00:41:16.868 --> 00:41:18.489]  There's helicopters flying around.
[00:41:18.749 --> 00:41:24.793]  They have school children there with their arms blown off, simulated, plastic blown off arms, plastic intestines.
[00:41:25.053 --> 00:41:29.677]  They spray fake red syrup, smear it all over them.
[00:41:31.078 --> 00:41:31.418]  And they've had...
[00:41:32.142 --> 00:41:32.622]  Not hundreds.
[00:41:32.683 --> 00:41:34.384]  It's got to be thousands of these around the country now.
[00:41:34.744 --> 00:41:40.809]  But now with the drills reported by the Associated Press and by World Net Daily, they get 200 elementary students.
[00:41:41.009 --> 00:41:42.210]  This is part of their schooling now.
[00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:44.912]  They lay out in the parking lot of the elementary school.
[00:41:45.372 --> 00:41:46.613]  Five buses pull up.
[00:41:46.993 --> 00:41:54.059]  Men run around with black masks and machine guns saying, we are from homeschoolers against public education.
[00:41:54.119 --> 00:41:55.400]  We're going to kill you.
[00:41:57.699 --> 00:41:58.979]  And I've talked to the families, folks.
[00:41:58.999 --> 00:42:00.740]  A lot of this was in the paper, but not to the full extent.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.640]  We're going to kill you!
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:04.501]  Homeschoolers are going to kill you!
[00:42:04.921 --> 00:42:07.401]  Folks, imagine the Soviet Union 50 years ago.
[00:42:07.521 --> 00:42:14.123]  They would have had their children get out in the school parking lots and simulated some dissonant groups going to kill you.
[00:42:14.163 --> 00:42:18.384]  I mean, we'd say, pure re-education, pure unbelievable brainwashing.
[00:42:18.664 --> 00:42:20.244]  My gosh, look at those evil commies.
[00:42:20.944 --> 00:42:22.525]  If the Nazis did it, what would we say?
[00:42:23.485 --> 00:42:25.145]  But see, here it's normal.
[00:42:25.886 --> 00:42:27.086]  We're going to have your...
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:32.043]  In Belton, it was junior high students.
[00:42:32.063 --> 00:42:33.644]  And in the past, it was junior high and high school.
[00:42:33.704 --> 00:42:36.506]  Now, it's elementary students, and you have to take part.
[00:42:36.887 --> 00:42:37.607]  This is your schooling.
[00:42:37.627 --> 00:42:48.015]  We're going to pour fake blood all over you and string fake rubber intestines with white cream sauce and red cream sauce, literally.
[00:42:48.296 --> 00:42:50.037]  It looks real.
[00:42:50.677 --> 00:42:52.459]  Smattering it all over the place.
[00:42:53.371 --> 00:42:56.633]  I mean, do you understand how insane this is?
[00:42:57.093 --> 00:42:59.574]  Are you starting to get an idea why I'm so upset?
[00:43:01.255 --> 00:43:04.236]  In the town where I live, we have fake bio-attacks.
[00:43:04.556 --> 00:43:06.357]  We have fake nuclear spills.
[00:43:07.738 --> 00:43:09.718]  We have federally funded checkpoints.
[00:43:10.299 --> 00:43:12.260]  We have federally funded microphones.
[00:43:12.580 --> 00:43:14.741]  We have federally funded face-scanning cameras.
[00:43:14.801 --> 00:43:17.662]  Now going up in neighborhoods, they put them up on all the street corners.
[00:43:18.303 --> 00:43:25.188]  We have insane behavior around me in San Antonio and eight other towns.
[00:43:25.288 --> 00:43:26.989]  Delta forces slammed into us.
[00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:28.010]  They've done drills.
[00:43:28.030 --> 00:43:37.898]  They covertly leased a building and then set the thing on fire and blow it up with Czech Republic troops running around screaming, and I have police chiefs admitting it on video!
[00:43:39.098 --> 00:43:41.080]  I live in a twilight zone area!
[00:43:41.846 --> 00:43:42.486]  But you know what?
[00:43:42.546 --> 00:43:44.727]  I got articles where they're doing it all over the country.
[00:43:45.007 --> 00:43:48.229]  In New Mexico, and California, and New York, and Ohio.
[00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:53.751]  Right now, Marines, Army, foreign troops, helicopters blowing up buildings.
[00:43:53.791 --> 00:43:56.052]  The public told to stay inside their houses.
[00:43:57.213 --> 00:43:58.133]  Come on, people!
[00:43:58.193 --> 00:43:59.634]  This is re-education!
[00:44:00.074 --> 00:44:02.135]  En masse going on right now!
[00:44:04.258 --> 00:44:08.559]  And that's all these terror alerts are every week or two now where they evacuate the Capitol.
[00:44:08.639 --> 00:44:19.662]  That's what this is with fake hand grenades and a firecracker, basically a cherry bomb going off inside of a plastic fake hand grenade and blowing out the side of a planter.
[00:44:20.782 --> 00:44:26.043]  And again, folks, as kids, we throw cherry bombs inside planters and inside trash cans and watch the lid blow off.
[00:44:26.323 --> 00:44:27.564]  That's basically what happened here.
[00:44:29.524 --> 00:44:32.445]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, when I was 12 years old, we'd
[00:44:33.177 --> 00:44:38.541]  Well, even with my dad, we'd have fun in the backyard, sticking firecrackers in the ground and fire ant beds.
[00:44:38.581 --> 00:44:42.424]  Maybe that's Al-Qaeda.
[00:44:43.064 --> 00:44:46.306]  I've even got a road almanac in my car, which they say is an Al-Qaeda sign.
[00:44:47.687 --> 00:44:50.249]  But it's insane.
[00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:51.510]  And I know I'm ranting.
[00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:58.375]  It's just, we have a huge fake terror alert section on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:44:59.955 --> 00:45:08.519]  We have just scores and scores and scores of mainstream news articles where they go, okay, the White House Press Secretary admits that they're issuing terror alerts for political purposes.
[00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:10.240]  Ari Fleischer, two years ago, before he left.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:16.363]  Okay, we have CIA officers and FBI going public saying they were ordered to issue fake terror alerts.
[00:45:18.344 --> 00:45:22.466]  Folks, if you issued a fake terror alert under the Patriot Act, you'd get five years in prison.
[00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:25.728]  That's one of the good provisions in there, quite frankly.
[00:45:26.108 --> 00:45:26.248]  But...
[00:45:27.071 --> 00:45:31.932]  If you yell fire in the theater, you're going to get in big trouble, especially if somebody breaks their leg getting trampled.
[00:45:33.872 --> 00:45:35.792]  We can't do that, and we shouldn't be able to.
[00:45:36.673 --> 00:45:37.853]  But they do it.
[00:45:40.393 --> 00:45:41.393]  They do it.
[00:45:42.174 --> 00:45:45.214]  And they do it whenever they want to, in your face.
[00:45:47.354 --> 00:45:49.235]  All right, folks, I have masses of news.
[00:45:49.335 --> 00:45:56.316]  I haven't even scratched the surface here, but I want to go to these loaded phone lines, Dave and Michael and Brett and Michael and James and many others.
[00:45:58.030 --> 00:45:59.891]  Before I do that, just two quick plugs.
[00:46:03.332 --> 00:46:04.393]  I've made 12 films.
[00:46:04.453 --> 00:46:06.414]  My 12th and most powerful video ever.
[00:46:06.454 --> 00:46:07.474]  It's really a miniseries.
[00:46:07.494 --> 00:46:08.435]  Three films in one.
[00:46:08.795 --> 00:46:11.176]  Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State is out.
[00:46:12.576 --> 00:46:15.238]  You can go to Infowars.com and watch half the film for free.
[00:46:15.278 --> 00:46:15.838]  Download it.
[00:46:16.678 --> 00:46:19.999]  With an idea of what you're going to be purchasing, get it on VHS or DVD.
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:27.483]  It covers the police state, 9-11, who the globalists are, the occult connections, the Nazi connections with the Bushes and Schwarzenegger.
[00:46:27.863 --> 00:46:29.083]  It is a powerful film.
[00:46:29.143 --> 00:46:30.284]  It is my crowning achievement.
[00:46:30.544 --> 00:46:32.725]  You've absolutely got to get this video.
[00:46:33.305 --> 00:46:36.546]  You've got to get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, my second best, and it's amazing.
[00:46:37.066 --> 00:46:40.468]  You've got to get The Masters of Terror, the police state series.
[00:46:41.613 --> 00:46:45.275]  My second to latest film, American Dictators, get one copy for $19.95.
[00:46:46.056 --> 00:46:46.756]  The second's $5.95.
[00:46:46.937 --> 00:46:51.259]  Each additional copy on DVD to get four or five copies and give them as gifts.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:53.541]  And it makes this program possible.
[00:46:53.921 --> 00:46:56.443]  It helps me to be able to keep my staff hired.
[00:46:56.743 --> 00:47:00.685]  The three webmasters I've gotten, the great lady that does the shipping and customer service.
[00:47:01.706 --> 00:47:02.507]  How many employees do I have?
[00:47:02.867 --> 00:47:06.789]  One, two, three, four, and then a part-time.
[00:47:06.869 --> 00:47:08.110]  And I've got to have these employees.
[00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:09.351]  I can't do it all anymore.
[00:47:10.436 --> 00:47:11.857]  And so we need your support as well.
[00:47:11.937 --> 00:47:12.837]  This is how you support us.
[00:47:13.397 --> 00:47:14.238]  Call right now.
[00:47:14.758 --> 00:47:15.678]  Get martial law.
[00:47:15.818 --> 00:47:20.120]  Don't wait.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.241]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:47:22.361 --> 00:47:23.582]  Ask about the specials when you call.
[00:47:23.602 --> 00:47:26.563]  A lot of other videos and books we carry about other wonderful researchers.
[00:47:26.583 --> 00:47:28.284]  888-253-3139.
[00:47:28.304 --> 00:47:35.807]  Or go to InfoWars.com and order your hard copy today off the SecureSafe shopping cart.
[00:47:37.236 --> 00:47:37.837]  Certified.
[00:47:38.257 --> 00:47:38.637]  Secure.
[00:47:39.018 --> 00:47:40.259]  Ladies and gentlemen, by Verisign.
[00:47:40.899 --> 00:47:41.279]  Yahoo!
[00:47:41.319 --> 00:47:42.280]  Shopping Cart, by the way.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:43.721]  One of the best out there.
[00:47:44.322 --> 00:47:55.331]  So, again, go to InfoWars.com, get the films, or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139 or watch all 12 of my films.
[00:47:55.871 --> 00:47:57.853]  Got to be over 100 special TV reports.
[00:47:58.233 --> 00:48:00.395]  We've now had presentplanet.tv for over a year.
[00:48:00.975 --> 00:48:04.398]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions, $0.15 a day, with a monthly $0.19 a day.
[00:48:05.802 --> 00:48:09.864]  Excuse me, 19 cents a day with a monthly, 15 cents a day with a yearly subscription.
[00:48:10.284 --> 00:48:13.766]  You basically get three months for free with a yearly subscription.
[00:48:14.166 --> 00:48:18.649]  But, I mean, who can't afford 19 cents a day for a monthly subscription?
[00:48:19.009 --> 00:48:21.050]  And that makes it all possible, what we're doing here.
[00:48:21.770 --> 00:48:23.251]  That's what pays for the webmasters.
[00:48:23.811 --> 00:48:26.773]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:48:27.333 --> 00:48:29.314]  A bunch of other films, a bunch of e-books.
[00:48:30.577 --> 00:48:33.539]  By best audio interviews, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:48:33.659 --> 00:48:34.340]  Do not wait.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.702]  Get the films, my friends.
[00:48:37.722 --> 00:48:39.323]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:48:40.464 --> 00:48:46.988]  Also want to thank Radio Free Austin here locally for the plug they're running for the Alamo Draft House showing.
[00:48:47.789 --> 00:48:50.751]  The great movie theater where they have food and drinks and everything at your table.
[00:48:50.771 --> 00:48:53.233]  You have your own table in the movie theater.
[00:48:54.233 --> 00:48:57.956]  We've got the whole shebang at the Alamo Draft House Friday, June 3rd.
[00:49:00.222 --> 00:49:02.406]  Coming up in about, what, 22 days?
[00:49:03.428 --> 00:49:04.891]  Friday, June 3rd.
[00:49:06.515 --> 00:49:08.258]  And that's the Alamo Drafthouse downtown.
[00:49:08.319 --> 00:49:09.521]  Two showings, 7 and 10 p.m.
[00:49:11.747 --> 00:49:15.489]  I'll give a little speech at the beginning, show the film, take 20, 30 minutes, a question and answer.
[00:49:16.010 --> 00:49:17.831]  Then we'll show it again at 10 o'clock.
[00:49:18.371 --> 00:49:21.813]  So whether you want the early showing or the late showing, they'll both be great.
[00:49:22.113 --> 00:49:24.094]  Friday, June 3rd, Alamo Drafthouse, downtown.
[00:49:24.334 --> 00:49:31.499]  You can buy tickets right now at Infowars.com by linking through to their safe, secure ticket service at Drafthouse.com.
[00:49:32.737 --> 00:49:34.058]  That's on Infowars.com.
[00:49:34.098 --> 00:49:34.658]  Direct link.
[00:49:35.018 --> 00:49:36.599]  You don't have to hunt around for it.
[00:49:37.079 --> 00:49:44.503]  And then coming up the next week, Wednesday, June 8th, 8 o'clock, Alamo Draft House, their new beautiful theater on South Lamar.
[00:49:44.923 --> 00:49:45.523]  One showing.
[00:49:45.863 --> 00:49:47.104]  So three showings total.
[00:49:47.424 --> 00:49:48.245]  Be sure and be there.
[00:49:49.005 --> 00:49:49.885]  Please take action.
[00:49:51.166 --> 00:49:53.267]  And then, last but not least, a plug for the network.
[00:49:55.095 --> 00:49:56.456]  7.95 a month.
[00:49:56.516 --> 00:49:58.817]  You get the archives, the complete archives.
[00:49:59.397 --> 00:50:02.278]  They're uploaded every day within two or three hours of all the shows.
[00:50:02.298 --> 00:50:04.338]  Listen in your leisure, whenever you like.
[00:50:04.719 --> 00:50:09.480]  For 9.95, get unlimited archives and the 16-bit dedicated stream.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.821]  It's twice the audio quality of the free 8-bit stream.
[00:50:12.161 --> 00:50:13.962]  Most networks don't even have a free stream.
[00:50:14.202 --> 00:50:18.083]  We're going to keep the 8-bit streams, but again, bandwidth is very expensive.
[00:50:18.857 --> 00:50:20.238]  Believe me, you don't have to tell me about it.
[00:50:20.298 --> 00:50:20.618]  I know.
[00:50:20.638 --> 00:50:24.800]  The network had to do this, and this is what helps the network continue.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:29.582]  So, GCNlive.com, GCNlive.com, link through.
[00:50:29.922 --> 00:50:35.564]  Or you can just buy an entire month of any show you want, including this one, for, what, $19.95?
[00:50:36.164 --> 00:50:39.146]  How many hours is five days a week, three hours a day for my show?
[00:50:39.546 --> 00:50:40.706]  I don't get any money for that.
[00:50:40.986 --> 00:50:41.727]  That's for the network.
[00:50:42.627 --> 00:50:44.888]  But that supports them and allows us to continue.
[00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:45.728]  They need your support.
[00:50:46.248 --> 00:50:47.269]  GCNlive.com.
[00:50:47.939 --> 00:50:49.280]  Alright, that's enough of the plugs.
[00:50:49.300 --> 00:50:52.804]  When we come back, we'll go straight to your calls and to a ton of news.
[00:50:53.184 --> 00:50:55.166]  I am fired up, so stay with us!
[00:51:02.489 --> 00:51:09.895]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.155 --> 00:51:14.899]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.119 --> 00:51:20.764]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:21.004 --> 00:51:25.529]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:32.916]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:51:32.936 --> 00:51:36.340]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[00:51:37.621 --> 00:51:40.142]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[00:51:40.362 --> 00:51:47.125]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[00:51:47.325 --> 00:51:52.568]  Order online now at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.

[00:52:01.997 --> 00:52:04.979]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:04.999 --> 00:52:14.183]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.484 --> 00:52:19.146]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.626 --> 00:52:26.352]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.753 --> 00:52:38.523]  It also removes foul-tasted odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:39.003 --> 00:52:43.467]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.627 --> 00:52:47.950]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:52:47.970 --> 00:52:50.692]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:52:50.712 --> 00:52:51.773]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[00:54:07.900 --> 00:54:10.962]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[00:54:11.523 --> 00:54:14.165]  A gun on my hip and the right to arrest.
[00:54:14.285 --> 00:54:17.487]  I'm the guy who's a boss on this highway.
[00:54:17.707 --> 00:54:20.509]  So watch out what you're doing when you're driving my way.
[00:54:20.809 --> 00:54:26.353]  If you break the law, NWO, we're going to expose you as the murdering trash traders you are.
[00:54:29.457 --> 00:54:33.038]  Can you see me coming?
[00:54:33.118 --> 00:54:36.499]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead and go to the calls here.
[00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:38.680]  I'm just sick of these terrorists, fear mongers.
[00:54:38.940 --> 00:54:40.340]  I'm tired of their mind control.
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:41.921]  I'm tired of their garbage!
[00:54:42.581 --> 00:54:45.502]  The more freedom you give up, the more these criminals are going to abuse you.
[00:54:46.222 --> 00:54:48.202]  Dave in Michigan, go ahead and thanks for holding.
[00:54:48.802 --> 00:54:49.563]  Yeah, Alex, hi.
[00:54:49.923 --> 00:54:50.243]  Hello.
[00:54:51.112 --> 00:55:05.033]  I'm a professional web developer here in Michigan, and I've been watching your movie, the DVD, the new one, Marshall 9-1-1, and I was kind of inspired to do something to, it initially was an idea for myself to
[00:55:05.555 --> 00:55:05.695]  I think.
[00:55:24.614 --> 00:55:29.695]  You know, we would have done that, but literally, I think we put like 400 articles in the film.
[00:55:29.715 --> 00:55:30.936]  Well, I've got them all.
[00:55:31.356 --> 00:55:37.637]  And so I was so exhausted at the end of it, I could have put it in a data section on the DVD.
[00:55:37.697 --> 00:55:38.237]  I just didn't.
[00:55:38.818 --> 00:55:40.758]  Okay, well, I've done it for you.
[00:55:40.778 --> 00:55:45.059]  This is a gift, and it's something that's a labor of love.
[00:55:45.099 --> 00:55:45.659]  What does it do?
[00:55:45.679 --> 00:55:47.260]  I mean, so it's just got all the news articles.
[00:55:47.980 --> 00:55:52.841]  So you sat there and typed in the headline of everything, found the article, and posted it.
[00:55:53.664 --> 00:55:58.648]  Right, and I've actually done an actual interface around it that looks like the DVD.
[00:55:59.028 --> 00:56:05.293]  I've got the DVD chapters and parts menu on the left, and it's split up just like the DVD.
[00:56:05.334 --> 00:56:06.014]  Well, that's great.
[00:56:06.074 --> 00:56:10.177]  If we want to, can we mirror that and post it on Infowars.com?
[00:56:10.217 --> 00:56:11.458]  Alex, it's all yours.
[00:56:12.639 --> 00:56:13.620]  Well, you're a sweetheart.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.741]  What's that website again?
[00:56:15.722 --> 00:56:18.024]  www.marshalllaw911.info
[00:56:20.868 --> 00:56:25.311]  I've even put up a glossary of terms, links and more information to all your info.
[00:56:25.351 --> 00:56:26.872]  How many articles do you have posted?
[00:56:27.852 --> 00:56:31.494]  I didn't count them, but once you take a look at the website, you'll know.
[00:56:31.835 --> 00:56:35.017]  There are 400 plus articles in the film.
[00:56:35.317 --> 00:56:38.579]  They're all there, and they're all, like I said, subcategorized just like the DVDs.
[00:56:38.679 --> 00:56:39.439]  Unbelievable.
[00:56:39.479 --> 00:56:41.200]  Well, I need to hire you, Dave, then.
[00:56:41.541 --> 00:56:43.822]  If you're able to get this done, I'll tell you.
[00:56:44.386 --> 00:56:49.048]  Yeah, well, I wouldn't mind speaking to you about it off the air.
[00:56:49.088 --> 00:56:50.008]  Well, let me check it out.
[00:56:50.048 --> 00:56:50.968]  I'm sure it's great work.
[00:56:51.008 --> 00:56:53.349]  Marshall Law, 911.info.
[00:56:53.529 --> 00:56:54.510]  Correct.
[00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:56.770]  Well, that's exciting.
[00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:58.451]  Send a link to my webmaster.
[00:56:58.491 --> 00:56:59.431]  Make sure it gets posted.
[00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:02.032]  Is that the tips at infowars.com?
[00:57:02.172 --> 00:57:02.492]  Yeah.
[00:57:02.572 --> 00:57:03.513]  What else is on your mind?
[00:57:04.533 --> 00:57:05.153]  Well, that was it.
[00:57:05.193 --> 00:57:08.674]  I just wanted to inform you and make you aware of that and have you check it out.
[00:57:08.734 --> 00:57:10.195]  What did you think of the film itself?
[00:57:11.250 --> 00:57:14.673]  Well, I've probably watched it over 20 times, so if that tells you anything.
[00:57:14.873 --> 00:57:15.354]  What are you doing?
[00:57:15.374 --> 00:57:16.054]  Making copies?
[00:57:16.534 --> 00:57:17.395]  I've made copies.
[00:57:17.415 --> 00:57:29.305]  I've actually bought DVD cases and the printable labels, and I've made copies that look almost just like your identical one, and I've been giving them to my band members, my friends, my family members, and they love it.
[00:57:29.385 --> 00:57:31.066]  They come back and say, wow, man.
[00:57:31.126 --> 00:57:32.787]  How long did it take you to build that site?
[00:57:34.469 --> 00:57:36.150]  I worked on it all last week.
[00:57:36.190 --> 00:57:39.593]  I just finished up getting the domain set up the last couple of days.
[00:57:40.445 --> 00:57:43.808]  And a couple of days, I spent like 13, 14 hours straight on it.
[00:57:43.848 --> 00:57:46.070]  But like I said, it's something I wanted to do.
[00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:47.671]  It originally started out as an idea.
[00:57:47.691 --> 00:57:49.833]  I wanted to print out every article and make a book.
[00:57:50.714 --> 00:57:56.759]  And then I thought, well, as I'm gathering this information, I was like, why don't I just go ahead and save the links and make a web page?
[00:57:56.819 --> 00:57:58.981]  And then it just evolved into this website.
[00:58:00.622 --> 00:58:05.686]  Each article has the DVD time that the article appears on the stage right next to it with source information.
[00:58:05.706 --> 00:58:08.629]  And then I've also got a Google icon next to each one of these articles.
[00:58:09.215 --> 00:58:13.658]  That expands out into a search about the same subject or the same article.
[00:58:14.358 --> 00:58:15.919]  So it's pretty comprehensive.
[00:58:15.979 --> 00:58:26.546]  And like I said, I have a glossary of terms used in the movie and then links that are subcategorized like the DVD is to more information on your InfoWars and PrisonPlanet.com websites.
[00:58:27.767 --> 00:58:28.768]  Unbelievable.
[00:58:28.848 --> 00:58:29.668]  I'll tell you what, Dave.
[00:58:29.688 --> 00:58:35.412]  Let me get your full name and number during this break, and I really appreciate the incredible job you're doing.
[00:58:35.432 --> 00:58:36.433]  I can't wait to check it out.
[00:58:37.119 --> 00:58:37.499]  Okay, Alex.
[00:58:37.559 --> 00:58:38.580]  That's my pleasure.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:39.800]  Take care, my friend.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:43.222]  Do me a favor, Stephanie, or whoever's riding a shotgun right now.
[00:58:44.262 --> 00:58:45.763]  Get Dave's info for me.
[00:58:46.243 --> 00:58:46.623]  Thank you.
[00:58:47.384 --> 00:58:48.064]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:58.009 --> 00:58:58.689]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.329 --> 00:59:00.430]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:02.190]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.851 --> 00:59:03.671]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.431 --> 00:59:05.212]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.974 --> 00:59:09.955]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.175 --> 00:59:14.256]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:32.561 --> 00:59:35.143]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, now into hour number two.
[00:59:35.163 --> 00:59:37.805]  Of course, we have one of the fake terror alerts, an errant plane.
[00:59:38.345 --> 00:59:43.248]  The nice men in black uniforms had to evacuate the congressmen and order the media around at the Capitol.
[00:59:43.629 --> 00:59:45.370]  Turned out, as usual, to be a false alarm.
[00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:47.951]  We have Bush with fake hand grenades being thrown at him.
[00:59:47.971 --> 00:59:51.674]  We have the British government, obviously, with firecrackers setting them off.
[00:59:52.563 --> 00:59:54.384]  In front of their embassy in New York last week.
[00:59:54.804 --> 00:59:56.205]  The scaremonger and fairmonger.
[00:59:56.225 --> 00:59:58.906]  We have fake terror drills all over the country going on.
[00:59:58.926 --> 00:59:59.887]  I've been talking about that.
[00:59:59.947 --> 01:00:03.549]  They passed the Real ID Act last night in the Senate.
[01:00:03.569 --> 01:00:05.410]  It has nothing to do with stopping illegal aliens.
[01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:07.091]  It actually empowers them.
[01:00:07.671 --> 01:00:10.873]  We've got Declan McCullough from CNET News coming on to talk about that in the third hour.
[01:00:11.173 --> 01:00:12.373]  Ron Paul's coming on tomorrow.
[01:00:12.413 --> 01:00:19.217]  He was going to be on today, but the congressman is stuck on some flight or something, I've been told, by his chief staffer.
[01:00:19.929 --> 01:00:27.014]  We've probably had Ron Paul on 25 times over the years, so we always look forward to having him on to give you the real scoop of what's going on.
[01:00:28.035 --> 01:00:31.398]  Bush is to pay for illegal aliens to have health care when American citizens don't get it.
[01:00:32.258 --> 01:00:33.679]  It's all paid for if you're an illegal alien.
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:38.683]  Wall Street Journal, government wants to remote control your air conditioning under new proposal.
[01:00:39.204 --> 01:00:43.006]  Real wages fall at fastest rate in 14 years, Financial Times.
[01:00:44.368 --> 01:00:48.711]  Spotlight on surveillance, more cities deploy camera surveillance systems with federal grant money.
[01:00:49.338 --> 01:00:51.680]  North Korea running around threatening to test a nuke.
[01:00:53.441 --> 01:00:55.822]  Suspect claims FBI ordered Saudi torture.
[01:00:55.922 --> 01:00:57.283]  Claims the government admits it.
[01:00:58.524 --> 01:01:02.166]  Drug official supports random drug testing of all American school children.
[01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:03.927]  U.S.
[01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:05.388]  pays for care of illegal aliens.
[01:01:05.408 --> 01:01:06.209]  Already mentioned that.
[01:01:06.229 --> 01:01:07.470]  I guess they got back into the stack.
[01:01:08.490 --> 01:01:12.553]  I want to get into the police machine gunning everything in L.A.
[01:01:12.593 --> 01:01:14.394]  a few days ago and why this is so important.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.081]  And, folks, there's just so much coming up.
[01:01:17.101 --> 01:01:21.043]  But let's get all these callers out of the way that have been holding from time immemorial.
[01:01:22.164 --> 01:01:22.604]  Michael.
[01:01:23.284 --> 01:01:24.525]  Michael, where are you calling me from?
[01:01:24.885 --> 01:01:25.445]  Arkansas.
[01:01:25.665 --> 01:01:26.046]  Welcome.
[01:01:26.086 --> 01:01:26.626]  Can you hear me?
[01:01:27.086 --> 01:01:28.287]  Yes, my Razorback.
[01:01:28.687 --> 01:01:35.971]  I'd like to talk about... Well, sir, we're not going to do that on my broadcast.
[01:01:36.891 --> 01:01:44.295]  I don't... I choose, in some cases, what I'll allow to be brought up on this broadcast, and I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:01:44.375 --> 01:01:44.735]  Take care.
[01:01:45.382 --> 01:01:47.143]  Good to hear from you.
[01:01:47.644 --> 01:01:48.844]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brent.
[01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:50.386]  Brent, where are you calling from?
[01:01:52.007 --> 01:01:52.627]  Go ahead, Brent.
[01:01:52.667 --> 01:01:53.228]  You're on the air.
[01:01:53.688 --> 01:01:54.989]  Hey, it's Brent in Missouri, Alex.
[01:01:55.009 --> 01:01:55.489]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:01:56.030 --> 01:02:04.836]  I was just wanting to put some information out there, something I saw on Fox Television Sunday night, and it was about one of the most blatant New World Order plugs I've ever seen.
[01:02:05.316 --> 01:02:05.716]  Oh, really?
[01:02:05.756 --> 01:02:06.357]  Tell us about it.
[01:02:07.117 --> 01:02:08.258]  Well, I was channel surfing.
[01:02:08.278 --> 01:02:11.941]  You know, on Sunday nights, you don't have too many choices, what with Desperate Housewives and all, but...
[01:02:12.887 --> 01:02:16.768]  I happened to catch part of the animated series American Dad, I believe it's called.
[01:02:17.949 --> 01:02:20.750]  And the main character is supposed to be a CIA agent.
[01:02:21.290 --> 01:02:27.572]  And for whatever reason, I just happened to change the channel so I'm not up to speed on the whole story of the episode.
[01:02:28.132 --> 01:02:30.933]  But for whatever reason, his daughter comes out with a shaved head.
[01:02:32.294 --> 01:02:39.456]  So the dad pulls out a cart with three Styrofoam heads on it and with wigs on top of them and says the wigs are modeled
[01:02:40.129 --> 01:02:43.494]  After the most influential conservative first ladies to occupy the White House.
[01:02:44.496 --> 01:02:46.919]  He points to the first one and says Barbara Bush.
[01:02:48.001 --> 01:02:51.286]  Points to the next one and says the Nancy Reagan.
[01:02:51.746 --> 01:02:54.290]  And points to the third one and says Maria Shriver.
[01:02:54.551 --> 01:02:55.071]  Stay tuned.
[01:02:56.468 --> 01:02:59.010]  Oh, it's unending Schwarzenegger promotion.
[01:02:59.071 --> 01:03:02.153]  Our ads are about to be running in Sacramento and here in Austin.
[01:03:02.173 --> 01:03:04.335]  We're doing that this week, finalizing it.
[01:03:04.976 --> 01:03:07.138]  And, no, I mean, they just keep pushing and pushing.
[01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:07.858]  And Bush Sr.
[01:03:07.879 --> 01:03:09.680]  said, hey, don't bet against Arnold.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.282]  He's probably going to end up being your president.
[01:03:11.662 --> 01:03:17.047]  And they've got the bills introduced to change the Constitution, just like they have bills introduced for the draft.
[01:03:17.617 --> 01:03:19.959]  But it's still called a conspiracy theory if you talk about it.
[01:03:20.219 --> 01:03:20.519]  Correct.
[01:03:21.100 --> 01:03:26.083]  It's like Bilderberg Group doesn't exist even when CNN announces, yes, it's real and they want world government.
[01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:30.847]  I wanted to tell about it because I've been aware of it.
[01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:34.669]  I've seen other shows that talk about it, and for me that was my first experience with it.
[01:03:34.709 --> 01:03:39.573]  Just that blatant, in-your-face, old, right, coming at you, we're coming to get you.
[01:03:41.511 --> 01:03:42.872]  Absolutely, in your face.
[01:03:42.912 --> 01:03:48.417]  And it doesn't matter if the majority of Americans don't want open borders or don't want Arnold Schwarzenegger or don't want implantable chips.
[01:03:48.737 --> 01:03:52.140]  The mainstream media just keeps saying, accept it, accept it, accept it, we'll be back.
[01:03:53.661 --> 01:03:57.984]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.184 --> 01:04:02.608]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.748 --> 01:04:07.172]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.192 --> 01:04:08.493]  The New World Order.
[01:04:10.274 --> 01:04:14.517]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.578 --> 01:04:21.523]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.623 --> 01:04:23.705]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.885 --> 01:04:34.514]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.

[01:05:49.045 --> 01:06:00.877]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:02.538]  It suppresses your immune system.
[01:06:02.759 --> 01:06:03.419]  Now check this out.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:07.163]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[01:06:07.183 --> 01:06:08.224]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[01:06:10.146 --> 01:06:12.828]  Do you know what happens when your immune system is compromised?
[01:06:13.088 --> 01:06:13.868]  Your health suffers.
[01:06:14.109 --> 01:06:14.729]  It's that simple.
[01:06:15.069 --> 01:06:19.012]  Here's how you can help your body win the fight with the dietary supplement Agaricus Bio.
[01:06:19.472 --> 01:06:27.397]  The dietary supplement Agaricus Bio was developed so that you can fight back again and again by giving your immune system a chance to be the first line of defense it was meant to be.

[01:06:58.058 --> 01:06:58.698]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.358 --> 01:07:00.399]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.139 --> 01:07:02.239]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.899 --> 01:07:03.719]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.459 --> 01:07:05.340]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:09.701]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.221 --> 01:07:14.342]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.242 --> 01:07:17.702]  Man, I tell you, I am fired up today.
[01:07:17.722 --> 01:07:20.963]  I guess because I wasn't here yesterday.
[01:07:21.856 --> 01:07:24.037]  I am just rip-roaring to go.
[01:07:24.057 --> 01:07:26.958]  We're going to talk to Michael, James, Mark, and Joe.
[01:07:26.978 --> 01:07:29.138]  Then I'm going to go back into this huge stack of news.
[01:07:29.158 --> 01:07:32.299]  When you talk about police state in your face, it's all there.
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:36.140]  But to be clear about this broadcast, this is my broadcast.
[01:07:36.901 --> 01:07:42.442]  Ted Anderson, who owns this network, never tells me what to do, never censors one centella of what I do.
[01:07:43.683 --> 01:07:46.524]  And I don't censor other people's websites and what they do.
[01:07:46.644 --> 01:07:47.664]  That's their right.
[01:07:48.244 --> 01:07:51.205]  If I was to go out like the Italian government did,
[01:07:52.466 --> 01:08:06.438]  And tell a Brazilian-based, or even if it was an Italian-based, indie media site, you can't put the head of the new pope, Ratzinger, on the body of a Hitler youth and put it on your website as a joke.
[01:08:07.479 --> 01:08:08.320]  That would be wrong.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:09.461]  That would be censorship.
[01:08:09.501 --> 01:08:18.028]  If I went out and I said, you can't have that website, or you can't stand on the sidewalk with a sandwich board around your neck,
[01:08:19.771 --> 01:08:25.216]  And, you know, say the end is near, or say George Bush is bad, or Bill Clinton's bad.
[01:08:25.956 --> 01:08:28.218]  I mean, I will fight to the death for your right to do that.
[01:08:29.499 --> 01:08:32.341]  But my broadcast, I choose who I have on as guest.
[01:08:32.982 --> 01:08:36.184]  I choose what I'm going to promote.
[01:08:36.565 --> 01:08:40.328]  And there's a lot of people out there that I don't even have problems with their material itself.
[01:08:41.208 --> 01:08:49.115]  I just have problems with people, basically, that want to push themselves and force themselves
[01:08:50.101 --> 01:08:50.381]  On me.
[01:08:51.062 --> 01:08:55.485]  And people that are obsessed with division.
[01:08:55.765 --> 01:09:00.888]  And if somebody spends about half their time attacking other patriots, I just don't get involved in it.
[01:09:00.928 --> 01:09:02.169]  That's a rule I have.
[01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:03.610]  It's a rule I've always had.
[01:09:03.970 --> 01:09:06.712]  I've broken my rule a few times, and it's never been good.
[01:09:07.672 --> 01:09:09.634]  It's a disease in the patriot movement.
[01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:16.498]  I mean, you take William F. Jasper from the New American that I'm a big fan of.
[01:09:18.351 --> 01:09:20.951]  I have a lot of friends that are in the John Birch Society.
[01:09:21.012 --> 01:09:22.352]  My father was involved.
[01:09:22.612 --> 01:09:23.912]  He was in the John Birch Society.
[01:09:23.932 --> 01:09:25.212]  He was part of the Young Conservatives.
[01:09:26.312 --> 01:09:33.454]  He, you know, the leadership, I forget all the names, but he went around giving anti-communist speeches, you know, when he was 15 years old.
[01:09:34.674 --> 01:09:36.034]  My dad wasn't valedictorian.
[01:09:36.054 --> 01:09:36.314]  What is he?
[01:09:36.334 --> 01:09:45.616]  He was salutatorian or whatever, you know, in high school, and he did real good in college, and he was involved with grants for big companies building lasers when he was in high school, and
[01:09:46.354 --> 01:09:48.735]  I have a soft spot in my heart for the John Birch Society.
[01:09:55.856 --> 01:10:20.260]  But when William F. Jasper comes out and mixes me in with real 9-11 info, disinfo 9-11 info, and basically attacks me for articles we posted on the website, and uses the Popular Mechanics model, and even says, hey, Popular Mechanics is doing a great job,
[01:10:21.218 --> 01:10:33.891]  And it doesn't mention that Benjamin Chertoff, who wrote the article, is cousins with the Homeland Security Director, and that the article is full of all these blaring falsehoods.
[01:10:35.572 --> 01:10:39.056]  Frankly, spending all day on that doesn't really do anything.
[01:10:39.096 --> 01:10:44.041]  That just ends up selling magazines for Popular Mechanics or for the New Americans.
[01:10:45.067 --> 01:10:47.528]  I mean, I'm tempted to try to get Mr. Jasper on.
[01:10:47.568 --> 01:10:49.989]  I've tried over the years to have him on as a friend.
[01:10:50.509 --> 01:10:52.270]  And he won't come on the show, which is fine.
[01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:53.070]  That's his right.
[01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.792]  I'm not going to attack him because he won't come on the show.
[01:10:55.832 --> 01:10:59.233]  I guess, you know, he wants to write news articles, not do interviews.
[01:11:00.454 --> 01:11:08.377]  But at the same time, that has to be responded to because we're being attacked, quote, on the facts.
[01:11:09.795 --> 01:11:16.577]  But if it's, you know, I'm being attacked on just basically delusional things.
[01:11:17.557 --> 01:11:18.957]  It's not about Alex Jones.
[01:11:18.997 --> 01:11:24.039]  This broadcast is not about Alex Jones, and it's not about a soap opera.
[01:11:24.799 --> 01:11:26.879]  It's about news and information.
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:36.762]  And if I deem, and I rarely do this, but if I deem that something is not in the interest of this broadcast and fighting the NWO,
[01:11:38.374 --> 01:11:40.135]  That is an individual of their information.
[01:11:40.155 --> 01:11:41.295]  I'm not going to have it on my show.
[01:11:41.455 --> 01:11:42.655]  This is my program.
[01:11:43.396 --> 01:11:49.437]  I don't tell people what to do with their websites and their radio shows, and I would never do that.
[01:11:49.857 --> 01:12:00.460]  This is my broadcast, and if I don't like something, and I deem it's very rare, once or twice a year, that I think it's destructive, I'll have no part of it.
[01:12:02.961 --> 01:12:04.001]  And at the same time,
[01:12:04.761 --> 01:12:06.822]  You know, it goes back to years and years ago.
[01:12:07.143 --> 01:12:10.545]  I learned how to deal with people in the media in general.
[01:12:11.586 --> 01:12:12.426]  How to not care.
[01:12:13.207 --> 01:12:24.335]  When I had stalkers, and I mean mean stalkers that threatened to kill me on a daily basis, that were out front my house, that were putting stuff on my front door, that were doing just... I mean, you've seen those movies about stalkers?
[01:12:24.355 --> 01:12:25.816]  Well, folks, they can make a movie about this.
[01:12:26.796 --> 01:12:28.217]  I mean, just unbelievable stuff.
[01:12:28.317 --> 01:12:30.599]  And I learned just to not care.
[01:12:32.031 --> 01:12:46.375]  And the funny part is that people think the New York Times when they attack me, or John Ronson, or Vanity Fair, or American Legion, or Front Page Magazine, or any of these people, they think that when they attack me that it bothers me.
[01:12:46.475 --> 01:12:48.675]  And no, that lets me know I'm doing good.
[01:12:48.695 --> 01:12:56.818]  That lets me know that I'm affecting change, that I'm getting at the New World Order, that I'm getting something done.
[01:12:57.938 --> 01:12:58.478]  And I love it.
[01:12:59.452 --> 01:13:04.016]  I mean, quite frankly, it's almost sick, but I like it.
[01:13:05.037 --> 01:13:06.698]  That's the funny part about it.
[01:13:06.779 --> 01:13:10.542]  But I know it's destructive, so I try to shut it down on the show.
[01:13:11.783 --> 01:13:21.231]  And, you know, I probably shouldn't even have had an hour and a half, or was it like an hour and 45 minutes, that front page magazine guy on a few weeks ago.
[01:13:23.653 --> 01:13:25.094]  Because it was so...
[01:13:26.753 --> 01:13:27.333]  Mindless.
[01:13:27.854 --> 01:13:30.595]  His arguments were so emotional, it just wasted time.
[01:13:31.416 --> 01:13:34.998]  In fact, I said I'd go back to calls, but now I've burned through too much time on this.
[01:13:36.339 --> 01:13:40.261]  We need to stop focusing so much on ourselves individually and look out at the world.
[01:13:41.602 --> 01:13:44.363]  And work with people that work with others.
[01:13:44.604 --> 01:13:50.267]  And by that I mean that don't endlessly engage in just ego-worship.
[01:13:51.068 --> 01:13:55.071]  Individuals that are really getting things done.
[01:13:55.091 --> 01:13:56.953]  And there's a lot of them out there.
[01:13:57.393 --> 01:14:00.515]  So I would encourage you to be part of that.
[01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:03.798]  So we'll go to Mike and James and Mike and Joe.
[01:14:04.758 --> 01:14:06.600]  Oh, there's so many others here in a few minutes.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:09.402]  But I've just got to get to all this news.
[01:14:09.462 --> 01:14:15.787]  I could talk about this fake grenade thing with Bush or the fake terror alerts all day long.
[01:14:15.847 --> 01:14:17.348]  But let's get into this first.
[01:14:19.338 --> 01:14:19.738]  The U.S.
[01:14:19.799 --> 01:14:22.121]  pays for care of illegal aliens.
[01:14:22.842 --> 01:14:23.803]  This is out of the New York Times.
[01:14:23.823 --> 01:14:31.931]  The Bush administration said yesterday that it would start paying hospitals and doctors for providing emergency care to illegal immigrants.
[01:14:32.512 --> 01:14:36.576]  The money, totaling $1 billion, will be available to service providers today.
[01:14:38.445 --> 01:14:39.686]  In border states.
[01:14:39.726 --> 01:14:42.588]  And it goes on, members of Congress from border states had sought the money.
[01:14:43.069 --> 01:14:55.257]  They said treatment of illegal immigrants imposed a huge financial burden, it's $3 billion a year in California, on many hospitals which are required to provide emergency care to patients who need it, regardless of their immigration status or ability to pay.
[01:14:55.277 --> 01:14:58.759]  Yeah, and I already went through this last hour.
[01:14:59.259 --> 01:15:01.861]  I mean, if you've got insurance, you're a second-class citizen.
[01:15:02.141 --> 01:15:04.023]  If you don't have insurance, you're a third-class citizen.
[01:15:04.043 --> 01:15:06.064]  If you're an illegal alien, front of the line.
[01:15:06.084 --> 01:15:07.485]  And it goes for that with housing.
[01:15:08.554 --> 01:15:11.636]  The police release was a Houston Chronicle article last year.
[01:15:11.656 --> 01:15:15.097]  400,000 illegal aliens with convictions.
[01:15:15.678 --> 01:15:17.658]  Thousands of them murderers, rapists.
[01:15:17.698 --> 01:15:18.559]  That was Houston Chronicle.
[01:15:19.099 --> 01:15:21.780]  Because it's just an unwritten rule, let them go.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.741]  Remember the railway killer?
[01:15:23.781 --> 01:15:25.822]  He killed and killed and killed and they kept releasing him?
[01:15:26.463 --> 01:15:28.664]  I mean, these people are almost like gods.
[01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:33.346]  They've almost got more rights than even our godly police that are first class citizens.
[01:15:35.484 --> 01:15:47.287]  Government wants to remote control your air conditioner under new proposals still smarting from its disastrous filing with electricity deregulation four years ago.
[01:15:47.347 --> 01:15:56.750]  California is pursuing another ambitious energy program that ultimately could set an example or serve as a warning for other states.
[01:15:58.300 --> 01:16:01.603]  Three big utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
[01:16:01.683 --> 01:16:05.727]  Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electricity Co.
[01:16:06.227 --> 01:16:18.759]  plan to eventually replace millions of conventional electricity and gas meters with as many as 15 million high-tech time-of-use devices at a cost of some $3.6 billion.
[01:16:18.779 --> 01:16:19.179]  The whole state...
[01:16:24.926 --> 01:16:30.199]  Overrun was about $9 billion with the power, and that was all an Enron scam with the fake computers.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.803]  But nobody ever talks about that.
[01:16:32.788 --> 01:16:39.333]  Behind the program is the state's perennial need to curb growth energy use and a desire to boost utilities efficiency.
[01:16:39.373 --> 01:16:40.194]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:16:40.534 --> 01:16:46.939]  They're going to put these on all of the meters on the power to your house directly to the air conditioner and will cut it off.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:50.682]  Remember, they'd order people, can't have Christmas tree lights, can't do this.
[01:16:50.762 --> 01:16:55.326]  I told you, that was just getting you ready for regulated and controlled use.
[01:16:55.886 --> 01:16:57.047]  They've got plenty of power.
[01:16:57.288 --> 01:16:58.649]  They can build more power plants.
[01:16:58.669 --> 01:17:00.090]  They've got plenty of power plants.
[01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:07.056]  They'd rather have a false perceived need of lack of energy, lack of water, lack of oil.
[01:17:07.436 --> 01:17:11.480]  I've got the prospectuses written up by the big think tanks a decade ago.
[01:17:12.401 --> 01:17:18.386]  Remember how many years ago did I tell you they're going to say there's no oil, they're going to say there's no water, they're going to say there's no power, they're going to claim all this.
[01:17:18.846 --> 01:17:20.608]  The IMF documents came out right after 9-11.
[01:17:20.908 --> 01:17:21.709]  Greg Palast got them.
[01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:24.852]  Bill Zicklitz, the chief economist, quit and went public.
[01:17:25.432 --> 01:17:27.334]  And it says, we go in, we take over...
[01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:30.552]  We turn off water for a week to make people think there's no water.
[01:17:30.872 --> 01:17:34.054]  Then when we triple prices the next week, they'll accept it.
[01:17:34.134 --> 01:17:36.895]  But only if we turn it off first, claiming there's no water.
[01:17:37.836 --> 01:17:41.438]  See, they jack up oil prices to $3 a gallon, $3.50 in some areas.
[01:17:41.878 --> 01:17:47.442]  Then they lower it back down to $2.20 a gallon for 87 octane, and you accept it.
[01:17:47.502 --> 01:17:50.483]  It's psychological warfare.
[01:17:52.445 --> 01:17:56.387]  The utilities plan to pay for the devices and pass it on to the consumers.
[01:17:57.264 --> 01:17:58.245]  Through higher rates.
[01:18:00.406 --> 01:18:04.228]  And it's just like computers already read your meters now in most cities.
[01:18:05.809 --> 01:18:08.251]  And it can shut off your power period automatically.
[01:18:09.231 --> 01:18:09.912]  Your gas.
[01:18:11.212 --> 01:18:14.675]  Real wages fall at fastest rate in 14 years.
[01:18:14.695 --> 01:18:16.896]  And I want to go back before I get to that.
[01:18:17.356 --> 01:18:18.697]  Look at this control grid.
[01:18:19.338 --> 01:18:23.244]  You'll be swiping your national ID card when you buy food because of the national sales tax.
[01:18:23.484 --> 01:18:24.666]  There'll also be a fat tax.
[01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:26.529]  Face scanning cameras are everywhere.
[01:18:27.290 --> 01:18:30.194]  They'll know how much power you're using, be able to turn it off anytime they want.
[01:18:30.875 --> 01:18:33.179]  The highway departments are going to be paid to have automatic...
[01:18:33.937 --> 01:18:37.041]  Electronic cones that come out and block the road.
[01:18:37.081 --> 01:18:38.863]  These barrels with wheels.
[01:18:39.604 --> 01:18:40.425]  All robotic.
[01:18:40.445 --> 01:18:41.707]  We're just a few globalists.
[01:18:42.248 --> 01:18:45.252]  Half the military is going to be drone aircraft in 2010.
[01:18:46.033 --> 01:18:47.575]  Thousands of drone robots.
[01:18:48.255 --> 01:18:50.258]  Everything is going to be controlled by just a few people.
[01:18:50.739 --> 01:18:51.520]  Total control.
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:19:01.444]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[01:19:01.964 --> 01:19:07.387]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[01:19:07.787 --> 01:19:17.813]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, epinoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:20.294]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[01:19:20.674 --> 01:19:23.656]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost purple.
[01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:25.337]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[01:19:25.477 --> 01:19:32.960]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[01:19:33.221 --> 01:19:34.981]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[01:19:35.302 --> 01:19:47.068]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[01:19:47.568 --> 01:19:51.910]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[01:19:53.405 --> 01:19:56.886]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:19:57.146 --> 01:20:00.648]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[01:20:11.471 --> 01:20:19.394]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:20:19.794 --> 01:20:25.158]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.

[01:20:59.328 --> 01:21:00.229]  It still is.
[01:21:00.829 --> 01:21:04.333]  Gold and other precious metals have continued to grow in value over the years.
[01:21:04.653 --> 01:21:06.455]  You know the old saying, good as gold?
[01:21:06.996 --> 01:21:09.038]  Well, there's a valuable lesson in that expression.
[01:21:09.617 --> 01:21:11.637]  Protect yourself in these uncertain times.
[01:21:12.018 --> 01:21:19.679]  With the stock market on the skids, and really, nowhere to put your money that makes a lot of sense, it's time to invest in a little wealth insurance.
[01:21:20.059 --> 01:21:23.820]  And that's gold, silver, and other rare and valuable coins and precious metals.

[01:23:08.235 --> 01:23:14.458]  All right, you can tell I'm getting really hyped up today because when I attempt to cover all the news in properly detail, there's never enough time.
[01:23:14.478 --> 01:23:17.600]  And I want to go to your calls, but I want to get to all this news.
[01:23:17.620 --> 01:23:21.762]  There's just so much of it here, and it's all so important.
[01:23:24.064 --> 01:23:28.846]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls, and I'll get back into all this news coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:29.507 --> 01:23:30.747]  Mike in Florida, thanks for holding.
[01:23:30.767 --> 01:23:31.147]  Go ahead.
[01:23:31.568 --> 01:23:31.968]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:33.168 --> 01:23:33.568]  How you doing?
[01:23:33.869 --> 01:23:34.369]  Yes.
[01:23:34.429 --> 01:23:45.419]  Listen, that website one of your previous callers talked about, marshalllaw911.info, is absolutely one of the most professional, comprehensive pieces of artwork I've ever seen.
[01:23:45.439 --> 01:23:48.101]  You've got to go to it and just plug it from now on.
[01:23:48.121 --> 01:23:50.303]  Well, let me ask Scott.
[01:23:50.363 --> 01:23:52.425]  Scott, did you get David and Michigan's number?
[01:23:53.723 --> 01:23:54.223]  Okay, good.
[01:23:55.244 --> 01:24:01.870]  I don't allow myself to have a computer in studio, though I should because I end up surfing and not focusing.
[01:24:01.890 --> 01:24:05.352]  But I think I'm going to break that rule soon and put a computer back in here.
[01:24:05.372 --> 01:24:06.854]  But as soon as I'm off air, I'll look at it.
[01:24:07.214 --> 01:24:09.396]  Yeah, this thing is magnificent.
[01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:11.477]  This guy put a lot of effort into it.
[01:24:11.497 --> 01:24:12.418]  I'm just going to plug it for you.
[01:24:12.458 --> 01:24:14.260]  MarshallLaw911.info.
[01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:18.743]  I've always wanted something like this, and now someone came out here and made it.
[01:24:19.023 --> 01:24:22.226]  The other thing I want to talk about was I was over at LibertyThink.com today.
[01:24:22.754 --> 01:24:26.357]  And at the very top of the website, they have a list of the Bilderberg attendees.
[01:24:26.777 --> 01:24:28.459]  Yeah, we have that on Prison Planet right now.
[01:24:28.639 --> 01:24:30.240]  Yeah, the 2005 list?
[01:24:30.481 --> 01:24:30.741]  Yes.
[01:24:31.001 --> 01:24:31.521]  It's incredible.
[01:24:31.541 --> 01:24:32.843]  You've got people from the WHO.
[01:24:32.863 --> 01:24:37.166]  You've got heads of former and current socialist movements.
[01:24:37.226 --> 01:24:40.609]  You've got the outgoing World Bank president, the incoming World Bank president.
[01:24:40.629 --> 01:24:46.894]  You've got people from the AEI, including the Prince of Darkness himself, the Hudson Institute.
[01:24:46.914 --> 01:24:47.595]  You've got the Fords.
[01:24:48.115 --> 01:24:48.996]  Ridiculous what's there.
[01:24:50.256 --> 01:24:51.196]  This is out of control.
[01:24:52.776 --> 01:24:54.657]  By the Prince of Darkness, you mean Richard Perle.
[01:24:54.757 --> 01:24:54.997]  Yeah.
[01:24:55.917 --> 01:24:56.477]  Yeah.
[01:24:56.517 --> 01:25:02.118]  The other thing I wanted to say is, you know, I want to do something more than just passing out CDs and whatnot.
[01:25:02.178 --> 01:25:05.039]  I was wondering if maybe you need someone to come on to work for you.
[01:25:05.499 --> 01:25:07.319]  I don't want any type of compensation.
[01:25:07.959 --> 01:25:12.520]  I'm great at analyzing and gathering tremendous amounts of files and data and looking through it.
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:17.701]  A lot of people want to help us, but I don't ever have anybody...
[01:25:18.979 --> 01:25:20.759]  Who works for me who isn't paid.
[01:25:21.379 --> 01:25:22.680]  Okay.
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:36.902]  I think volunteering is good at big events or on rare occasions, but you heard me tell David that I'd like to pay him for his work.
[01:25:37.122 --> 01:25:39.103]  I don't know if I can.
[01:25:39.883 --> 01:25:45.284]  We had a fellow build us SearchInfoWars.com.
[01:25:46.664 --> 01:25:49.906]  And that's another... We have our own private search engine, our own private web page.
[01:25:50.286 --> 01:25:51.066]  This fella built it.
[01:25:51.086 --> 01:25:51.847]  I appreciate him.
[01:25:52.147 --> 01:25:57.190]  I mean, stuff like that, if people want to do that, and they never tell us about it, they just do it, I appreciate it.
[01:25:57.590 --> 01:26:02.793]  One time, you know, things like that are great, but I think you should just be your own leader.
[01:26:03.973 --> 01:26:05.094]  Start your own website.
[01:26:05.934 --> 01:26:12.018]  Start your own AXS TV show, or get your own weekend radio show, and get involved yourself, sir.
[01:26:12.058 --> 01:26:16.040]  And if you want to help us, you know, on your website, if you want to put a link to us, that's great.
[01:26:17.693 --> 01:26:19.014]  You need help with people.
[01:26:19.795 --> 01:26:20.576]  Here's the problem.
[01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:22.959]  I have to sit there and tell people what I want them to do.
[01:26:23.800 --> 01:26:29.846]  And then that ends up taking almost... This is the problem that structures have as they get bigger.
[01:26:29.866 --> 01:26:31.127]  And I'm still very, very small.
[01:26:31.828 --> 01:26:32.028]  Is that...
[01:26:34.073 --> 01:26:34.493]  We're good to go.
[01:26:34.513 --> 01:26:34.994]  We're good to go.
[01:27:03.846 --> 01:27:09.990]  And there's other people out there, and if I find others, and I have to watch them over a long period of time, I don't just trust people.
[01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:11.271]  There's a lot of vipers out there.
[01:27:11.811 --> 01:27:17.775]  If I see they have a good track record, in the future, if we ever got enough capital, I would hire more people.
[01:27:17.995 --> 01:27:20.937]  That's our goal, is to be more effective, and I can't do it all.
[01:27:21.797 --> 01:27:25.640]  What about just sending in whatever I get to tipsandinfowars.com?
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.841]  Oh, listen, that's what the listeners do.
[01:27:27.881 --> 01:27:30.523]  That's why we have a lot of news that other people don't get.
[01:27:30.543 --> 01:27:30.923]  Okay.
[01:27:31.912 --> 01:27:32.733]  Well, I'll get on that.
[01:27:32.773 --> 01:27:34.874]  Also, I had a mention, I think, yesterday on your show.
[01:27:34.914 --> 01:27:44.262]  I don't know if maybe you said you weren't live yesterday or not, but you made a mention of some of the propaganda we get in our films, like Long Kiss Good Night, and also that pilot episode with Dean Hoagland.
[01:27:45.123 --> 01:27:46.484]  I went back and I watched Long Kiss.
[01:27:46.504 --> 01:27:49.426]  I wasn't sure if maybe you got the two episodes mixed.
[01:27:49.486 --> 01:27:52.288]  I thought you said they mentioned the 9-11 thing in Long Kiss Good Night.
[01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:52.989]  No.
[01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:55.911]  Long Kiss Good Night was made in the mid-90s.
[01:27:57.342 --> 01:28:00.985]  And that's where the guy says he's going to blow the building up like the government tried to do in 93.
[01:28:01.345 --> 01:28:03.607]  They mentioned the real bombing there.
[01:28:03.927 --> 01:28:10.192]  Then I was talking about, separately, months before 9-11, the Lone Gunman episode on Fox.
[01:28:10.532 --> 01:28:13.214]  Yeah, see, I watched that movie last night.
[01:28:13.254 --> 01:28:16.417]  I didn't see any mention of the World Trade Center.
[01:28:16.437 --> 01:28:22.141]  What they did say, though, was that they lost their funding, so they were going to blow a truck up into town.
[01:28:22.561 --> 01:28:23.782]  In order to get their funding back.
[01:28:23.802 --> 01:28:25.783]  You may be watching an edited version.
[01:28:25.963 --> 01:28:27.524]  I have the Long Kiss Goodnight video.
[01:28:27.744 --> 01:28:35.288]  Okay, well, maybe what I saw was different, but what they did basically was, you know, to do what Applied just said, and they, you know, had their terrorist hat to be ready on ice, ready to go.
[01:28:36.609 --> 01:28:37.649]  All right, thank you for the call.
[01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:39.010]  I appreciate it.
[01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:40.131]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[01:28:40.151 --> 01:28:40.611]  Stay with us.
[01:28:44.253 --> 01:28:45.154]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.634 --> 01:28:47.255]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.155 --> 01:28:50.837]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.823 --> 01:29:00.345]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:29:00.485 --> 01:29:01.545]  You wear deodorant, right?
[01:29:01.665 --> 01:29:02.546]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:29:02.646 --> 01:29:05.487]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:29:05.687 --> 01:29:10.648]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:29:10.808 --> 01:29:11.889]  Check out this new product.
[01:29:12.049 --> 01:29:15.030]  It's called No-B-O, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:29:15.310 --> 01:29:19.031]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:29:19.171 --> 01:29:19.351]  Look.
[01:29:19.551 --> 01:29:21.872]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.
[01:29:21.932 --> 01:29:26.754]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[01:29:27.035 --> 01:29:30.156]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[01:29:30.276 --> 01:29:35.699]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:29:35.779 --> 01:29:36.519]  Try Nobio.
[01:29:36.659 --> 01:29:37.639]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.705]  No-B-O is so highly concentrated, a little goes a long way.
[01:29:41.885 --> 01:29:44.049]  Give them a call at 888-881-NO-B-O.
[01:29:44.069 --> 01:29:47.415]  Check out their website at no-vo.com.
[01:29:47.575 --> 01:29:50.881]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with No-B-O.

[01:30:05.071 --> 01:30:09.373]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:30:09.714 --> 01:30:12.716]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:30:13.036 --> 01:30:16.458]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:30:16.798 --> 01:30:26.149]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:30:26.409 --> 01:30:29.913]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[01:30:55.729 --> 01:31:01.213]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.634 --> 01:31:05.877]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:06.117 --> 01:31:13.143]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.523 --> 01:31:19.628]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.648 --> 01:31:20.989]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:21.169 --> 01:31:23.372]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:31:38.092 --> 01:31:41.237]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[01:31:41.257 --> 01:31:42.759]  866-885-6625 866-885-6625 One more time, that's 866-885-6625 Call today.
[01:32:05.043 --> 01:32:06.383]  Alright, that was another great caller.
[01:32:06.403 --> 01:32:07.664]  Brought up an important issue.
[01:32:08.964 --> 01:32:10.325]  And I get more and more behind, though.
[01:32:11.585 --> 01:32:13.546]  I'm going to give each caller about 60-70 seconds.
[01:32:13.566 --> 01:32:14.306]  That's all I can do.
[01:32:16.047 --> 01:32:17.387]  And I'll try to limit myself.
[01:32:17.527 --> 01:32:20.008]  It's just the stack is really big today, and it's all important.
[01:32:21.288 --> 01:32:26.410]  But commenting on Paul Watson, the difference between copying me and being of the same mind is very different.
[01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:30.051]  I can say to Paul, Paul, what do you think about this new development?
[01:32:31.968 --> 01:32:36.690]  And he'll generally already be aware of it before he even knows what my view is on it.
[01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:47.093]  He will give me the exact same complex analysis that I know only great discernment and intelligence can deploy.
[01:32:48.853 --> 01:32:49.173]  All right?
[01:32:50.774 --> 01:32:54.475]  And so that's why I hired Paul Watson.
[01:32:56.616 --> 01:33:00.937]  And it's frankly, look, there'd be more people like Paul
[01:33:02.185 --> 01:33:06.047]  If more people spent their time really studying this, you have to immerse yourself in it.
[01:33:06.988 --> 01:33:12.851]  And you have to study history then to use that as a template, then with an overlay of this high-tech system we're facing.
[01:33:14.492 --> 01:33:20.996]  I mean, really, it's like doing military analysis or being an analyst.
[01:33:21.016 --> 01:33:22.417]  And I respect the listeners.
[01:33:22.557 --> 01:33:26.419]  I mean, so many great emails I get, the great analysis you engage in.
[01:33:28.020 --> 01:33:29.621]  So many of the wonderful people out there.
[01:33:31.126 --> 01:33:52.342]  I mean, if you want to write analysis on different cases, on different issues, on what's happening, and if Paul or myself think that it's good, or think that it doesn't slander or libel someone, a lot of stuff's really good that we get, but some of it can't be totally proven or can be considered libelous or slanderous that we don't post it.
[01:33:52.402 --> 01:33:53.463]  That's another reason.
[01:33:54.514 --> 01:33:56.495]  That there's some things that we avoid.
[01:33:56.515 --> 01:34:01.058]  We're very careful about our proofing.
[01:34:01.898 --> 01:34:04.700]  And that's why these broadcasts take a lot of preparation.
[01:34:04.720 --> 01:34:10.783]  I mean, I was up again last night until about 2 o'clock in the morning researching.
[01:34:11.343 --> 01:34:15.526]  And then it's very frustrating to try to then articulate all that research here on air.
[01:34:18.107 --> 01:34:20.148]  That's why I just encourage you to get into research.
[01:34:20.208 --> 01:34:20.669]  It's fun.
[01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:21.309]  It's exciting.
[01:34:21.969 --> 01:34:22.810]  History is...
[01:34:24.497 --> 01:34:29.360]  And reality, as they say, is a lot stranger than the weirdest fiction novel.
[01:34:31.901 --> 01:34:33.782]  And it's also exciting to be involved.
[01:34:35.483 --> 01:34:38.244]  And this is not a broadcast that's going to be walked on.
[01:34:38.284 --> 01:34:39.925]  We're not going to be walked on by anybody.
[01:34:39.945 --> 01:34:41.366]  People aren't going to tell us what to do.
[01:34:41.706 --> 01:34:42.766]  We're not afraid of the government.
[01:34:42.786 --> 01:34:44.127]  We're not afraid of slime balls.
[01:34:45.188 --> 01:34:48.810]  And when my slime detector goes off of the chart, man, I just stay away from people.
[01:34:49.610 --> 01:34:52.211]  And then I keep them away from this broadcast.
[01:34:54.275 --> 01:34:56.976]  And the more I think about it, should I even try to get Benjamin Chertoff?
[01:34:56.996 --> 01:34:58.896]  I mean, I tried to get him on the show, but he won't do it.
[01:34:59.437 --> 01:35:00.477]  The more I think about it, good.
[01:35:00.497 --> 01:35:07.159]  You know, why have the Homeland Security Director's cousin on who wrote that hit piece in Popular Mechanics?
[01:35:07.499 --> 01:35:08.459]  They're being destroyed.
[01:35:08.499 --> 01:35:09.339]  They're being dismantled.
[01:35:09.359 --> 01:35:10.200]  They're being exposed.
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:15.181]  Why should I have... I don't know.
[01:35:15.261 --> 01:35:16.581]  I might have Jasper on.
[01:35:16.922 --> 01:35:18.782]  I don't think Jasper at the New American's bad.
[01:35:20.002 --> 01:35:21.683]  I just think that he doesn't have all the facts.
[01:35:22.623 --> 01:35:23.783]  So maybe I'll have him on.
[01:35:23.844 --> 01:35:29.826]  We'll try to heal the rift between some of the leadership of the John Birch Society and even some of their own members.
[01:35:30.526 --> 01:35:39.509]  I found out last night that William F. Jasper called a prominent member yesterday of the JBS here in Austin, Texas, asking questions about me.
[01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:42.711]  Well, I mean, Mr. Jasper, you don't have to do that.
[01:35:43.311 --> 01:35:45.512]  You can call up and ask Alex Jones those questions.
[01:35:47.973 --> 01:35:48.793]  See, I'm not afraid.
[01:35:49.633 --> 01:35:55.756]  You know, I went on NPR a few months ago, and they gave Mr. Chertoff, who wouldn't debate me on air, 14 minutes.
[01:35:55.796 --> 01:36:01.299]  They gave me three minutes with the host talking over me the whole time, and then gave themselves five more minutes to attack me.
[01:36:01.660 --> 01:36:02.380]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:04.381]  You listen to that interview, I defeated them.
[01:36:05.702 --> 01:36:10.284]  Because everything I said was basically sound bites that couldn't be taken out of context.
[01:36:11.645 --> 01:36:12.866]  I'll go into the enemy's den.
[01:36:15.037 --> 01:36:19.300]  But you've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[01:36:19.460 --> 01:36:21.922]  I have decent discernment.
[01:36:23.944 --> 01:36:27.607]  I can tell when stuff is a COINTELPRO operation.
[01:36:27.627 --> 01:36:29.368]  I can tell when it's a Homeland Security operation.
[01:36:29.708 --> 01:36:33.471]  I can tell when it's a Vanity Fair ego operation, pun intended.
[01:36:34.652 --> 01:36:35.172]  I can tell.
[01:36:36.213 --> 01:36:38.695]  And I learn more and more every day.
[01:36:38.715 --> 01:36:39.936]  I mean, I make mistakes.
[01:36:42.239 --> 01:36:45.542]  But it's about the information, my friends.
[01:36:46.263 --> 01:36:47.784]  That's what we should be concerned with.
[01:36:48.805 --> 01:36:51.167]  All of you should stop looking for leaders and look in the mirror.
[01:36:53.329 --> 01:36:55.391]  You know, I get emails every day asking for help.
[01:36:55.591 --> 01:36:56.973]  I mean, literally hundreds of them.
[01:36:57.113 --> 01:36:57.894]  Hundreds of calls.
[01:36:58.494 --> 01:36:59.355]  They're taking my farm.
[01:36:59.375 --> 01:37:00.176]  They're taking my ranch.
[01:37:00.196 --> 01:37:01.117]  They're taking my children.
[01:37:01.597 --> 01:37:03.319]  I barely have time to listen to the messages.
[01:37:03.659 --> 01:37:05.641]  I barely have time to read the sticky pad messages.
[01:37:06.161 --> 01:37:06.922]  I'm overwhelmed.
[01:37:07.833 --> 01:37:08.614]  And then people get mad.
[01:37:08.654 --> 01:37:10.075]  Well, why aren't you calling me back?
[01:37:10.135 --> 01:37:10.996]  Why aren't you helping me?
[01:37:11.476 --> 01:37:14.118]  Or some people get really vicious.
[01:37:14.158 --> 01:37:15.199]  Why aren't you interviewing me?
[01:37:15.219 --> 01:37:16.460]  Well, I'm sorry, I can't.
[01:37:17.201 --> 01:37:18.261]  Well, then, oh, you're bad.
[01:37:19.362 --> 01:37:20.503]  I'll never forget an email I got.
[01:37:21.164 --> 01:37:26.408]  Alex, I have an email on you and you haven't emailed me back, but I emailed Jeb Bush and he emailed me back personally.
[01:37:27.088 --> 01:37:31.532]  And I emailed the person back years ago and I said, listen, that's an auto-responder, that's his staff.
[01:37:31.892 --> 01:37:33.293]  No, the governor emailed me back.
[01:37:36.316 --> 01:37:36.416]  See?
[01:37:36.436 --> 01:37:36.496]  See?
[01:37:37.839 --> 01:37:39.380]  I mean, I can't please everybody.
[01:37:39.540 --> 01:37:40.461]  I can't do it all.
[01:37:41.001 --> 01:37:42.242]  I can't be your leader.
[01:37:42.802 --> 01:37:44.003]  I don't want to be your leader.
[01:37:45.603 --> 01:37:53.608]  I don't want to get up here and announce on air that I'm the founder of the 9-11 Truth Movement, or that I came up with the idea to throw the Patriot Act out at the city level.
[01:37:54.168 --> 01:38:04.334]  But because it's true, and then others claim that mantle, and then claim the authority because of that crown they put on their head, which is no crown at all, that I have to respond and go, well, that's not true.
[01:38:06.593 --> 01:38:08.454]  And I guess this is just part of the process.
[01:38:08.574 --> 01:38:16.657]  I mean, when you've been doing this for a decade, and when you are, frankly, the most prominent person in the patriot movement or the truth movement, it's something that people demand of you.
[01:38:17.237 --> 01:38:19.258]  You know, a lot of it's like being an old gunslinger.
[01:38:19.998 --> 01:38:23.580]  There's the fastest draw in the West, to use that parallel analogy.
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:26.081]  And every young buck wants to have a fight with you.
[01:38:26.841 --> 01:38:36.085]  And if you had a fight with every young buck that wanted to challenge you to make their bones on you, to count coup on you, then you would never be about your business.
[01:38:39.028 --> 01:38:40.729]  Oh, we'll go to your calls.
[01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:44.392]  I actually get tired looking at this stack.
[01:38:44.412 --> 01:38:46.393]  I mean, I can't do justice to any of this.
[01:38:46.413 --> 01:38:49.335]  I mean, it would take hours to cover each one of these articles.
[01:38:50.296 --> 01:38:54.399]  The government wants to remote control your air conditioner and decide when you can have air conditioner.
[01:38:54.419 --> 01:38:55.940]  I mean, this is the Soviet Union, folks.
[01:38:57.241 --> 01:38:59.863]  Bush and his fake hand grenade, you know, so he can be our savior.
[01:38:59.883 --> 01:39:00.904]  And, oh, look how brave he is.
[01:39:01.704 --> 01:39:04.366]  Real wages fall at fastest rate in 14 years.
[01:39:04.386 --> 01:39:07.448]  And they tell you, well, actually, they're calculating in inflation.
[01:39:07.488 --> 01:39:08.509]  Wages actually went up.
[01:39:09.184 --> 01:39:11.005]  But that's how they manipulate the index.
[01:39:11.025 --> 01:39:11.805]  Those are false numbers.
[01:39:12.065 --> 01:39:16.746]  They'll claim that employment's at an all-time high, but they don't count people that go off the unemployment rolls.
[01:39:17.687 --> 01:39:18.867]  They're using Cook numbers.
[01:39:19.587 --> 01:39:21.448]  But the Financial Times has done an analysis.
[01:39:23.288 --> 01:39:25.049]  This is happening across the Western world.
[01:39:25.549 --> 01:39:26.690]  Real wages in the U.S.
[01:39:26.710 --> 01:39:31.371]  are falling at their fastest rate in 14 years, according to data surveyed by the Financial Times.
[01:39:31.951 --> 01:39:33.252]  Inflation rose 3.1% in the year to March.
[01:39:33.272 --> 01:39:33.572]  That rose.
[01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:39.010]  We're good to go.
[01:40:07.868 --> 01:40:11.710]  And, I mean, do you need to look at statistics to know stuff's more expensive?
[01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:12.710]  It's unbelievable.
[01:40:13.371 --> 01:40:20.975]  My phone bills, my power bills, my water bill, the taxes on cell phones.
[01:40:22.335 --> 01:40:29.499]  I mean, I've given all my employees a raise, even though we are taking in less money than we ever have, even though the listenership doubles every year.
[01:40:29.959 --> 01:40:31.800]  The economy is falling apart.
[01:40:33.281 --> 01:40:34.121]  It is imploding.
[01:40:35.046 --> 01:40:39.667]  I know people with 2-3 degrees who've got 2-3 jobs who don't even get to see their children.
[01:40:39.747 --> 01:40:45.649]  Mommy and Daddy are both working to live in that middle-class house and to have that nice car because they think they have to have it.
[01:40:45.889 --> 01:40:48.230]  It'd be better to live in a shack and spend time with your children.
[01:40:49.730 --> 01:40:50.951]  It's unbelievable!
[01:40:51.291 --> 01:40:54.231]  We're competing against the millions of prisoners, the millions of illegal aliens.
[01:40:54.752 --> 01:40:57.993]  We're competing against millions of people with slave wages in China and India.
[01:40:58.333 --> 01:41:01.374]  Mexico's factories are shutting down in droves to move to China.
[01:41:01.654 --> 01:41:02.834]  They can't even compete now.
[01:41:04.841 --> 01:41:05.942]  It makes my head spin.
[01:41:06.022 --> 01:41:09.704]  Public and private and federal debt are at all-time levels.
[01:41:10.285 --> 01:41:13.867]  But the neocons in the news keep telling us how good the economy is.
[01:41:14.587 --> 01:41:18.390]  Every time I hear Rush Limbaugh, he says it's great and gives you some cooked numbers.
[01:41:18.410 --> 01:41:21.812]  It's unbelievable.
[01:41:23.240 --> 01:41:24.361]  Absolutely unbelievable.
[01:41:24.741 --> 01:41:33.366]  They talk about, oh, this big, even after last month's bumper gain in employment, there are 22,000 fewer private sector jobs than when the recession began in March of 2001.
[01:41:33.566 --> 01:41:36.228]  Yeah, we're now into a four-year recovery.
[01:41:36.548 --> 01:41:37.369]  It's not a recovery.
[01:41:37.869 --> 01:41:44.433]  And again, they're counting people that have two jobs as two jobs as if, and then they compare that to the population of working Americans.
[01:41:44.813 --> 01:41:45.694]  It's false numbers.
[01:41:47.595 --> 01:41:48.896]  It's unbelievable.
[01:41:51.175 --> 01:41:52.376]  All right, continuing here.
[01:41:52.696 --> 01:41:56.197]  I mean, you look at the big radio networks, Clear Channel, all of them.
[01:41:56.977 --> 01:42:00.459]  Their listenerships are at all-time highs, but their revenue is at all-time lows.
[01:42:01.459 --> 01:42:02.120]  Why is that?
[01:42:03.040 --> 01:42:05.341]  Because people just don't have money.
[01:42:08.362 --> 01:42:09.543]  It's unbelievable.
[01:42:09.603 --> 01:42:13.064]  We know the real economic numbers, and it is bad.
[01:42:14.945 --> 01:42:20.127]  Meanwhile, the government's got plenty of money to pay for all the illegal aliens' tuition and for their health care and everything else.
[01:42:21.400 --> 01:42:24.761]  Spotlight on surveillance is from the Electronic Privacy Information Center.
[01:42:25.121 --> 01:42:28.481]  More cities deployed camera surveillance systems with federal grant money.
[01:42:29.061 --> 01:42:33.502]  President Bush has proposed $2.57 trillion federal budget, and that's on budget.
[01:42:33.862 --> 01:42:44.884]  The other money, $600 billion plus, for fiscal year 2006, greatly increases the amount of money spent on surveillance technology and programs while cutting about 150 programs, most of them from the Department of Education.
[01:42:45.624 --> 01:42:49.405]  Epic Spotlight on Surveillance Project scrutinizes these surveillance programs.
[01:42:50.256 --> 01:42:51.277]  And that's smoke and mirrors.
[01:42:51.297 --> 01:42:58.922]  The Department of Education had its funding doubled in 2005 and 2004, and then they're just cutting a few small programs in the Department of Education.
[01:42:59.982 --> 01:43:01.523]  So they're cutting the massive increase.
[01:43:02.704 --> 01:43:07.827]  The Department of Homeland Security, DHS, has requested more than $2 billion in financial grants to state and local governments.
[01:43:08.427 --> 01:43:15.352]  $2 billion for Homeland Security needs includes face-scanning cameras, microphones, tilt, zoom, rotate capabilities, wireless technologies.
[01:43:16.763 --> 01:43:20.666]  And Chicago has 2,250 cameras in its Homeland Security grid.
[01:43:20.946 --> 01:43:22.307]  See, they call it a grid.
[01:43:22.828 --> 01:43:25.330]  I coined the term, the Cashless Society Control Grid.
[01:43:26.530 --> 01:43:27.231]  It goes on.
[01:43:27.611 --> 01:43:28.352]  I just can't even.
[01:43:29.092 --> 01:43:32.855]  Chicago will have a 900-mile fiber optic grid with cameras and microphones.
[01:43:33.816 --> 01:43:37.598]  And speakers will announce daily Homeland Security announcements.
[01:43:37.618 --> 01:43:39.420]  And they're going to take over the FEMA billboards.
[01:43:39.480 --> 01:43:44.463]  And it ties into the Amber Alert system to take over radio and TV for anti-gun announcements.
[01:43:44.523 --> 01:43:45.284]  It's already happening.
[01:43:46.596 --> 01:43:48.156]  And remember, today is Ozone Action Day.
[01:43:48.176 --> 01:43:48.937]  Don't drive your car.
[01:43:50.557 --> 01:43:54.578]  North Korea is taking the preparatory steps towards nuclear tests.
[01:43:54.618 --> 01:43:56.978]  Officials are now saying major escalation there.
[01:43:59.779 --> 01:44:01.839]  A drug official supports random drug testing.
[01:44:01.859 --> 01:44:02.900]  This is out of the Pitt News.
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:08.841]  Last year, the number of drug violations arrested in Pennsylvania climbed to 775, the highest rate in 2001.
[01:44:09.321 --> 01:44:13.862]  Since 2001, while the Drug Enforcement Administration sees more than a ton of marijuana in the state.
[01:44:15.413 --> 01:44:23.416]  Now the federal and state officials want to start forcibly testing every child in the state and other federal programs are doing it nationwide.
[01:44:23.816 --> 01:44:25.436]  Got a thumb scan to get your school lunches.
[01:44:25.476 --> 01:44:26.557]  Got to be drug tested.
[01:44:26.997 --> 01:44:34.660]  Then they're going to have forced psychological testing with the new Freedom Initiative written by the drug companies to try to force you on drugs more deadly than illegal drugs.
[01:44:34.980 --> 01:44:35.640]  There's your freedom.
[01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:38.141]  Now I wanted to spend some time on this.
[01:44:39.401 --> 01:44:42.422]  Folks, I'm like a third way through the stack, okay?
[01:44:43.202 --> 01:44:44.883]  We've got calls and guests coming up
[01:44:45.603 --> 01:44:47.685]  Two hurt in deputies crossfire.
[01:44:49.987 --> 01:44:50.367]  Oh boy.
[01:44:51.568 --> 01:44:55.772]  Again, how do I properly get into this?
[01:44:55.792 --> 01:45:00.156]  Remember four years ago, there was that big fire in L.A.
[01:45:00.216 --> 01:45:02.738]  and several houses caught on fire, one burned to the ground.
[01:45:03.339 --> 01:45:10.846]  The TV video images from helicopters were two black six-wheeled armored vehicles opening fire with M60 machine guns mounted.
[01:45:12.492 --> 01:45:19.277]  A retired cop who lived in a multi-million dollar house, wonder how, was in trouble for drugs and other things.
[01:45:19.837 --> 01:45:24.220]  And the inside info I got was he was going to blow the whistle on drug dealing by the sheriff's department.
[01:45:24.561 --> 01:45:34.388]  So a hit squad went out there, and the SWAT team was so bloodthirsty that they fired into over a dozen homes, catching two of them on fire, including the house that the cop was in.
[01:45:36.569 --> 01:45:38.871]  Two deputies were shot, one died, another was injured.
[01:45:40.137 --> 01:45:42.998]  I mean, just insane raking of 12 homes.
[01:45:43.398 --> 01:45:44.458]  They knew the house he was in.
[01:45:44.498 --> 01:45:53.119]  They were just so insane on such a maniac streak that they went crazy.
[01:45:53.159 --> 01:45:56.080]  And we posted the up-close L.A.
[01:45:56.100 --> 01:45:56.860]  Times photos.
[01:45:57.240 --> 01:45:58.480]  Their reporter deserves an award.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:00.480]  He got right up close with taking pictures.
[01:46:00.500 --> 01:46:09.102]  They were going so crazy that sheriff's deputies and others showed up, because it was in the county, and they shot their own officers.
[01:46:11.239 --> 01:46:14.122]  Midland, Texas, three years ago, and I see these cases every week.
[01:46:14.262 --> 01:46:15.443]  They don't normally get a lot of attention.
[01:46:15.883 --> 01:46:16.644]  They go to the house.
[01:46:16.684 --> 01:46:17.945]  The guy's wife's divorcing him.
[01:46:18.285 --> 01:46:19.146]  He throws a fit.
[01:46:21.187 --> 01:46:27.893]  He is throwing her stuff out onto the front lawn and starts burning one of her chester drawers.
[01:46:28.774 --> 01:46:30.315]  He's throwing a fit going crazy.
[01:46:31.343 --> 01:46:31.923]  I believe the news.
[01:46:31.943 --> 01:46:32.624]  I'm going from memory.
[01:46:32.804 --> 01:46:34.324]  We played the newscast here years ago.
[01:46:34.684 --> 01:46:36.005]  I believe he was on Prozac or something.
[01:46:36.025 --> 01:46:37.406]  But the point is, he's blowing up.
[01:46:37.446 --> 01:46:37.946]  He's screaming.
[01:46:38.246 --> 01:46:40.467]  He was an antique firearms enthusiast.
[01:46:40.787 --> 01:46:43.308]  That's all he owned was some old black powder guns and a safe.
[01:46:43.348 --> 01:46:44.069]  Didn't have them out.
[01:46:45.769 --> 01:46:46.770]  He runs in the house.
[01:46:46.810 --> 01:46:47.670]  Didn't threaten anybody.
[01:46:48.070 --> 01:46:50.991]  The SWAT teams get on both sides of the house going through different doors.
[01:46:52.192 --> 01:46:53.633]  Open fire to the room he's in.
[01:46:54.053 --> 01:46:55.894]  Shoot and kill one cop, injure another.
[01:46:57.374 --> 01:46:58.935]  They plant a gun on him.
[01:47:00.143 --> 01:47:02.784]  We have the audio from the SWAT vehicle that aired on the news.
[01:47:02.964 --> 01:47:04.185]  I think that's still on the computer.
[01:47:04.205 --> 01:47:05.225]  We ought to try to find that.
[01:47:05.605 --> 01:47:08.206]  Type in Midland SWAT raid audio, Scott.
[01:47:08.947 --> 01:47:11.128]  I bet we can find that and play it sometime in the next hour.
[01:47:12.288 --> 01:47:13.369]  And it's unbelievable.
[01:47:13.729 --> 01:47:19.371]  And they shoot their own officers, kill one, injure another, and then they try to plant it on him.
[01:47:19.391 --> 01:47:23.333]  Well, the good SWAT team member went public and said, no, it's a fraud, and some cops got in trouble.
[01:47:25.274 --> 01:47:27.675]  The point is, we've had the Austin police do the same thing.
[01:47:27.715 --> 01:47:29.616]  They shoot one of their officers and they plant a gun on you.
[01:47:29.696 --> 01:47:30.537]  It's just really sad.
[01:47:31.377 --> 01:47:35.119]  They had a school drill up in Fort Worth a few years ago.
[01:47:35.199 --> 01:47:36.079]  Killed cop of the year.
[01:47:36.119 --> 01:47:36.839]  Shot him in the head.
[01:47:37.199 --> 01:47:38.740]  Live ammo during a drill.
[01:47:39.060 --> 01:47:42.402]  Shot a kid in the face in a drill up in Detroit a few years ago.
[01:47:42.442 --> 01:47:43.482]  That's all in road to tyranny.
[01:47:44.783 --> 01:47:47.344]  But this newest one, the SUV just drives off.
[01:47:47.444 --> 01:47:48.385]  No gun, no threat.
[01:47:48.625 --> 01:47:49.325]  It's driving off.
[01:47:50.320 --> 01:47:51.801]  They go crazy and fire.
[01:47:51.861 --> 01:47:53.062]  Now it's over 200 shots.
[01:47:53.402 --> 01:47:54.483]  It says 120, over 200.
[01:47:54.563 --> 01:47:55.603]  We know over 120.
[01:47:55.643 --> 01:47:57.344]  Different articles say different things.
[01:47:57.665 --> 01:47:59.225]  Two hurt and deputies cross fire.
[01:47:59.245 --> 01:48:05.769]  At least five cops in homes are left with bullet holes as officers fire 120 rounds at unarmed SUV.
[01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:08.371]  And they shot two cops.
[01:48:10.392 --> 01:48:12.093]  Now that's the only reason somebody's going to get in trouble.
[01:48:12.777 --> 01:48:13.817]  I see articles in L.A.
[01:48:13.837 --> 01:48:16.318]  where this happens every week, but normally it's a minor footnote.
[01:48:16.719 --> 01:48:18.219]  Now somebody's going to get in trouble.
[01:48:18.699 --> 01:48:19.900]  And I've looked at the statistics.
[01:48:20.120 --> 01:48:22.801]  Cops' number one cause of death is being hit by cars.
[01:48:24.082 --> 01:48:25.502]  But notice they're not worried about that.
[01:48:25.522 --> 01:48:30.004]  They're out there standing there with their hind ends sticking out on the major highways as you drive by.
[01:48:30.204 --> 01:48:32.205]  Everybody has to get over in the other lane as a courtesy.
[01:48:32.785 --> 01:48:35.786]  And I see these cops with their hind ends sticking out in the road.
[01:48:35.906 --> 01:48:36.487]  It's crazy.
[01:48:37.187 --> 01:48:37.867]  I care about you.
[01:48:37.887 --> 01:48:38.607]  Why are you doing that?
[01:48:39.968 --> 01:48:42.349]  Out there to raise some stupid money the government's got plenty of.
[01:48:43.075 --> 01:48:44.076]  So that's the number one cause.
[01:48:44.416 --> 01:48:46.298]  The second cause is other cops.
[01:48:46.858 --> 01:48:48.619]  Now, that's your own federal numbers.
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:48:50.621]  And I know it's not advertised.
[01:48:50.641 --> 01:48:51.582]  You probably don't know about it.
[01:48:51.642 --> 01:48:55.104]  But this militarized police stuff is getting you killed.
[01:48:56.666 --> 01:48:57.947]  And it's getting us killed.
[01:48:58.407 --> 01:49:03.051]  And when you pull a gun on somebody because you're all hot to trot and you blow their head off, you don't get in trouble.
[01:49:03.291 --> 01:49:04.672]  But when you kill your own officers, you do.
[01:49:06.011 --> 01:49:07.513]  And you should get in trouble, period.
[01:49:07.533 --> 01:49:10.716]  And I got another one here where they tasered a pregnant woman because she argued with them.
[01:49:10.756 --> 01:49:11.838]  She didn't physically argue.
[01:49:12.058 --> 01:49:13.359]  She refused to sign the ticket.
[01:49:13.379 --> 01:49:15.261]  They tasered the pregnant woman, eight months pregnant.
[01:49:15.702 --> 01:49:20.167]  It's like the guy who's strapped down and won't give a urine sample, so they taser him to make him urinate.
[01:49:21.208 --> 01:49:25.613]  We got cops being trained to choke people when they peaceably sit in a soccer field protesting.
[01:49:25.893 --> 01:49:26.814]  It's open torture.
[01:49:27.853 --> 01:49:36.577]  So they've militarized them, they've turned us against us, and it's like attack dogs when they're busy taking down a wild hog, they'll go ahead and bite each other like sharks in a feeding frenzy.
[01:49:37.217 --> 01:49:37.657]  Stop it!
[01:49:38.218 --> 01:49:40.979]  Don't give yourselves over to the New World Order and the dark side.
[01:49:41.359 --> 01:49:41.839]  Wake up!
[01:49:42.980 --> 01:49:46.782]  Ah, we'll come back and just jam these calls in rapid fire on the other side of this break.
[01:49:47.762 --> 01:49:51.704]  We'll hold Declan McCullough until about 10 after so we can take more calls into the second, third hour.
[01:49:51.724 --> 01:49:52.084]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.985 --> 01:49:55.467]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.707 --> 01:49:58.770]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.910 --> 01:50:02.814]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.874 --> 01:50:07.098]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[01:50:07.438 --> 01:50:11.222]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.362 --> 01:50:13.164]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.444 --> 01:50:16.646]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[01:50:16.686 --> 01:50:21.408]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.568 --> 01:50:24.609]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:50:24.789 --> 01:50:27.651]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:28.151 --> 01:50:34.254]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.794 --> 01:50:36.896]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:55.143 --> 01:51:06.415]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:51:06.635 --> 01:51:10.119]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria.
[01:51:10.399 --> 01:51:10.839]  We're good to go.
[01:51:31.511 --> 01:51:38.455]  The Berkey light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.
[01:51:38.655 --> 01:51:44.598]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:44.838 --> 01:51:50.541]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:50.641 --> 01:51:51.922]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:54.289 --> 01:52:00.234]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:00.474 --> 01:52:02.736]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[01:53:00.933 --> 01:53:03.655]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Joe in Wisconsin.
[01:53:03.695 --> 01:53:05.156]  Joe, thanks for calling.
[01:53:05.176 --> 01:53:05.756]  You're on the air.
[01:53:05.776 --> 01:53:06.897]  Hey, Alex.
[01:53:07.317 --> 01:53:08.378]  I'll sum it up for you.
[01:53:08.558 --> 01:53:09.559]  Well, two things for you.
[01:53:10.219 --> 01:53:24.148]  Globalism grew the American technology industry and economy to the point where they can remotely manipulate everything they need, and when they've finally got what they need, they suck the life out of their host organism, us.
[01:53:24.898 --> 01:53:26.359]  Well, that's the analogy I've used.
[01:53:26.839 --> 01:53:27.059]  Yeah.
[01:53:27.739 --> 01:53:32.861]  Well, the second thing is, you know how Gloria Steinem was a CIA op to create Ms.
[01:53:32.901 --> 01:53:34.542]  Magazine and break up families?
[01:53:34.802 --> 01:53:37.503]  And so was Timothy Leary.
[01:53:37.943 --> 01:53:38.624]  Now admit it.
[01:53:38.684 --> 01:53:40.384]  I mean, she even wrote about it in her own book, but you know.
[01:53:40.624 --> 01:53:40.804]  Yeah.
[01:53:41.165 --> 01:53:45.646]  Well, Planned Parenthood is a government-paid population reduction program.
[01:53:45.706 --> 01:53:50.328]  We've got guests on your show saying that major media is a CIA branch.
[01:53:51.609 --> 01:53:54.530]  I know a few weeks ago you had a father ask you about
[01:53:55.140 --> 01:54:04.509]  No, that would be a good program and to talk about it with the callers and go over it would be a good CD to give the young people because
[01:54:18.826 --> 01:54:26.688]  I mean, this whole counterculture thing, rebel against your parents, dress and act like an idiot, that's just so you get caught in their snare and end up in one of their prison camps.
[01:54:27.269 --> 01:54:28.549]  Well, I think you're right.
[01:54:29.029 --> 01:54:30.130]  We need some good news.
[01:54:30.510 --> 01:54:43.294]  And if you could have maybe Pastor Butch on your show and help out with the morality side and how do we firm up our families and our communities, I'm all ears.
[01:54:44.614 --> 01:54:45.374]  It's a great idea.
[01:54:45.414 --> 01:54:47.055]  We should do an entire broadcast on that.
[01:54:47.075 --> 01:54:47.675]  Thank you for the call.
[01:54:49.224 --> 01:54:50.104]  Look, I mean, they know.
[01:54:50.304 --> 01:54:54.805]  You owe allegiance to your family, folks, over any other group or individual.
[01:54:56.005 --> 01:54:57.265]  And so they've got to destroy that.
[01:54:57.365 --> 01:55:07.727]  And then we've got their own policy reports, their own books, their own... I mean, I've got textbooks that they use as a primary source for social workers that are used for the last 30 years.
[01:55:07.747 --> 01:55:09.088]  And it says the family's bad.
[01:55:09.348 --> 01:55:10.188]  We're going to break it up.
[01:55:10.348 --> 01:55:11.128]  And that's what they're doing.
[01:55:11.488 --> 01:55:12.448]  They've done a great job.
[01:55:12.488 --> 01:55:13.508]  Then things fall apart.
[01:55:13.948 --> 01:55:17.229]  The government's got to come in to arrest everybody to fix the problem.
[01:55:18.534 --> 01:55:20.275]  Let's just real fast.
[01:55:20.375 --> 01:55:23.897]  Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police States out on VHS and DVD.
[01:55:23.937 --> 01:55:24.777]  It's my best film.
[01:55:24.817 --> 01:55:27.558]  Watch it right now at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:55:27.658 --> 01:55:29.419]  That and 11 other films I've done.
[01:55:29.439 --> 01:55:33.321]  Or simply call toll-free to get a hard copy.
[01:55:33.341 --> 01:55:33.441]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:33.461 --> 01:55:33.561]  888-253-3139.
[01:55:33.581 --> 01:55:33.861]  Don't wait.
[01:55:33.941 --> 01:55:35.101]  This is my best work.
[01:55:35.121 --> 01:55:36.022]  You need to have it.
[01:55:46.425 --> 01:55:47.826]  Tom in Florida.
[01:55:47.866 --> 01:55:48.527]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:55:49.267 --> 01:55:49.648]  Hi, Alex.
[01:55:50.288 --> 01:55:51.229]  First time caller.
[01:55:52.930 --> 01:56:07.462]  As the Bilderbergers meet in Germany in secret, complete with military guard to ostensibly decide our future, I'd like to share with you a civics lesson in the form of a couple of very short quotes from the time of our forefathers.
[01:56:07.582 --> 01:56:14.428]  In 1794, Alexander Hamilton, that anti-democratic federalist supporter of strong central government, private central banking,
[01:56:14.978 --> 01:56:38.776]  Government by secret society said of the local open democratic societies that people had a habit of belonging to in their local areas in those days, those horrible sinks of treason, those hateful synagogues of anarchy, those odious conclaves of tumult, those frightened cathedrals of discord, those poisonous gardens of conspiracy, and those hellish schools of rebellion in opposition to all
[01:56:39.511 --> 01:56:41.793]  And then also in 1794, those anti-federalists said,
[01:57:07.304 --> 01:57:33.230]  That these secret societies were instituted by crafty and cunning members primarily to sow the seeds of jealousy and distrust amongst the people of the government by destroying all confidence in the administration of it is not new to anyone who, having been attentive to their maneuvers, we gave it early to the opinion to the confidential characters around us that if these societies were not counteracted
[01:57:33.703 --> 01:57:36.825]  They would shake the government to its very foundation, unquote.
[01:57:37.125 --> 01:57:37.846]  Yeah, stay there.
[01:57:37.886 --> 01:57:39.727]  I'm going to let you finish up on the other side.
[01:57:39.767 --> 01:57:41.148]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:57:41.388 --> 01:57:41.728]  Hello!
[01:57:41.749 --> 01:57:42.149]  Big Brother.
[01:57:42.209 --> 01:57:42.829]  Mainstream Media.
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:54.381]  Hello, my friends.
[01:57:55.042 --> 01:57:55.622]  We are now...
[01:58:19.131 --> 01:58:28.359]  Into hour number three, coming up is Declan McCullough from CNET News to talk about the National Undecarded Loving Government just passed and what the provisions in it really do.
[01:58:28.379 --> 01:58:31.061]  And the states are already saying they're not going to follow it.
[01:58:31.081 --> 01:58:32.422]  Well, that was Bush's plan to begin with.
[01:58:32.462 --> 01:58:35.565]  See, they selectively will not enforce it on the illegal aliens.
[01:58:35.585 --> 01:58:42.050]  And I told everybody that, Ron Paul did, but conservatives got fooled by the left going out and fighting it
[01:58:44.071 --> 01:58:46.232]  And making up provisions in it that weren't there.
[01:58:46.552 --> 01:58:47.872]  And so, well, the left's against it.
[01:58:48.192 --> 01:58:49.193]  Why, it must be good.
[01:58:49.233 --> 01:58:51.053]  And the Democrats all run along and vote for it.
[01:58:53.154 --> 01:58:54.374]  We're talking to Tom in Florida.
[01:58:54.394 --> 01:59:00.656]  He was reading quotes about secret societies in America by the founding fathers in newspaper articles and major publications.
[01:59:00.696 --> 01:59:03.577]  I'm aware of a lot of those quotes that you were giving.
[01:59:04.346 --> 01:59:07.547]  And, yeah, everything that was just public knowledge back then doesn't exist.
[01:59:07.587 --> 01:59:09.828]  It's like the Bilderberg Group doesn't exist.
[01:59:09.848 --> 01:59:11.389]  You're insane if you believe it does.
[01:59:11.429 --> 01:59:12.409]  And now CNN.
[01:59:12.429 --> 01:59:13.550]  Yeah, it's real.
[01:59:13.590 --> 01:59:15.851]  It wants world government, but it's good.
[01:59:16.671 --> 01:59:17.711]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:59:18.371 --> 01:59:21.433]  Well, I mean, that's pretty much the nexus of it.
[01:59:21.933 --> 01:59:26.495]  You know, I'm a history buff, and I've been studying this stuff for probably close to 25 years.
[01:59:28.252 --> 01:59:40.716]  And I can assure you that in all of my studies, and they've been pretty careful, is that all roads lead to these same people over and over and over again.
[01:59:40.736 --> 01:59:43.617]  I know.
[01:59:43.917 --> 01:59:49.439]  And the stuff that was front page news 200 years ago, the average American has no idea it even exists.
[01:59:49.879 --> 01:59:50.099]  I know.
[01:59:51.215 --> 01:59:52.856]  Well, look, I mean, how do you maintain power?
[01:59:52.916 --> 01:59:54.496]  You set up intelligence agencies.
[01:59:54.976 --> 01:59:59.138]  The name of intelligence agencies 200 years ago was secret society.
[01:59:59.598 --> 02:00:00.878]  Secret service.
[02:00:00.898 --> 02:00:03.699]  You know, when they set up a thing, it's called the secret service.
[02:00:03.799 --> 02:00:04.260]  Exactly.
[02:00:04.280 --> 02:00:06.100]  I mean, that's all it is.
[02:00:06.400 --> 02:00:19.425]  I feel that in a true democracy, any time that word secret starts coming out, and people start using secrecy as a way of maintaining so-called national security or any other excuse,
[02:00:20.012 --> 02:00:23.996]  Alarm bells should go off in the heads of Democratic Americans.
[02:00:25.598 --> 02:00:29.622]  I mean, this is not something... The mafia's secret.
[02:00:29.722 --> 02:00:30.943]  Organized crime's secret.
[02:00:31.103 --> 02:00:32.765]  That's all this is, is organized crime.
[02:00:33.005 --> 02:00:36.809]  We've got to get out in the open with our dealings with each other.
[02:00:37.510 --> 02:00:41.734]  And if our government is not going to be out in the open in terms of what they're doing for all to see...
[02:00:42.307 --> 02:00:46.588]  Then we need to get involved and make... Well, let me tell you something.
[02:00:46.888 --> 02:00:48.588]  You're right, but we're hurting them, Tom.
[02:00:48.908 --> 02:00:52.409]  They've got their disinfo people out all over the web now trying to counter us.
[02:00:52.829 --> 02:00:53.769]  That means we're winning.
[02:00:53.789 --> 02:00:54.589]  That's good news.
[02:00:54.629 --> 02:00:55.189]  Thank you, Nicole.
[02:00:55.269 --> 02:00:55.569]  Thank you.
[02:00:55.829 --> 02:00:56.189]  Thank you.
[02:00:56.489 --> 02:00:56.989]  Great point.
[02:00:57.630 --> 02:00:58.350]  Tim in Ohio.
[02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.990]  Tim, go ahead.
[02:01:00.690 --> 02:01:01.390]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:01:01.410 --> 02:01:02.050]  How are you doing?
[02:01:02.290 --> 02:01:02.790]  Good, my buddy.
[02:01:02.810 --> 02:01:03.271]  What's going on?
[02:01:03.891 --> 02:01:11.692]  I wanted to know if you saw last night on the conspiracy brainwashing system the story about the Army recruiters.
[02:01:13.048 --> 02:01:14.850]  No, I didn't watch any TV yesterday.
[02:01:15.511 --> 02:01:18.554]  Okay, I liken these to modern-day child predators.
[02:01:18.574 --> 02:01:21.738]  Because, you know, I know you're familiar with all of the, you know, and the no child left behind.
[02:01:21.758 --> 02:01:23.440]  No, I've seen it in film and on the news.
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:24.160]  They stalk them.
[02:01:24.200 --> 02:01:24.841]  They push them.
[02:01:25.121 --> 02:01:28.125]  They hang over them at the playground, in the classrooms, in the lunchroom.
[02:01:28.365 --> 02:01:29.266]  They lie to them.
[02:01:29.706 --> 02:01:31.488]  Oh, yeah, it's horrible.
[02:01:31.568 --> 02:01:34.652]  Well, down in Houston, there's a Sergeant Thomas Kelp.
[02:01:35.356 --> 02:01:42.461]  Who was working a recruit, and the recruit decided that he was going to go ahead with a firefighter's career, and hung up the phone on the guy.
[02:01:42.501 --> 02:01:43.622]  Told him he wasn't interested.
[02:01:44.343 --> 02:01:49.667]  This guy, Sergeant Thomas Kelk, called him back, and here's the quote from their website.
[02:01:50.047 --> 02:01:55.271]  By federal law, you got an appointment with me at 2 o'clock this afternoon at Greens Point Mall.
[02:01:55.892 --> 02:01:58.554]  If you fail to appear, we'll have a warrant, okay?
[02:01:59.154 --> 02:02:00.155]  So give me a call back.
[02:02:00.555 --> 02:02:03.237]  And then when he called back, he said, oh, that's just a marketing technique.
[02:02:03.297 --> 02:02:04.098]  Don't worry about it.
[02:02:06.374 --> 02:02:08.998]  I know, lying, and I was aware they'd been threatening people.
[02:02:09.178 --> 02:02:09.959]  What was this on?
[02:02:10.300 --> 02:02:10.761]  It's criminal.
[02:02:10.781 --> 02:02:17.791]  It was on CBS News at 6.30, and it's on their website right now under a thing Army recruiters play, Hardball.
[02:02:18.091 --> 02:02:18.652]  Unbelievable.
[02:02:18.792 --> 02:02:22.838]  I've got the names and the numbers of his battalion commander and the public affairs for the Army.
[02:02:22.938 --> 02:02:25.481]  Bill Watson needs to be listening and getting this up immediately.
[02:02:25.521 --> 02:02:27.203]  Get this at tipsandinfowars.com.
[02:02:27.604 --> 02:02:28.224]  Get that up.
[02:02:28.304 --> 02:02:28.945]  Oh, my goodness.
[02:02:29.246 --> 02:02:30.187]  Tell you what, stay there.
[02:02:30.207 --> 02:02:31.068]  We've got to talk more about this.
[02:02:31.088 --> 02:02:32.109]  We've got Declan McCullough coming up.
[02:02:32.369 --> 02:02:35.072]  Go ahead and get Declan on, but I want him to be able to finish.
[02:02:35.133 --> 02:02:36.835]  I mean, you see what we're talking about here, folks?
[02:02:37.756 --> 02:02:39.157]  That is criminal.
[02:02:39.798 --> 02:02:42.121]  A marketing technique threatening arrest.
[02:02:45.720 --> 02:02:50.043]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:02:50.223 --> 02:02:54.645]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:02:54.805 --> 02:02:59.188]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:02:59.208 --> 02:03:00.569]  The New World Order.
[02:03:02.350 --> 02:03:06.572]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:03:06.632 --> 02:03:13.576]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:03:13.696 --> 02:03:15.758]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:03:16.058 --> 02:03:26.384]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:03:26.704 --> 02:03:32.071]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[02:03:32.571 --> 02:03:35.194]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[02:03:45.649 --> 02:03:56.375]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:03:56.556 --> 02:04:04.160]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:04.420 --> 02:04:07.542]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[02:04:07.702 --> 02:04:08.082]  We're good to go.
[02:04:26.357 --> 02:04:32.321]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:04:32.541 --> 02:04:40.666]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:40.726 --> 02:04:44.048]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:04:44.108 --> 02:04:52.093]  For some time now, many people have heard of the benefits of Oregosin, Oreganol, Oregomax, and the many other health products from North American Urban Spice.
[02:04:52.433 --> 02:04:53.654]  Dr. Cass Ingram has stated...
[02:04:54.094 --> 02:05:04.722]  Extracts of wild oregano, notably the P-7-3 oil, and particularly the P-7-3 oregano, completely obliterate the human cold virus in 20 minutes in one dose with a 100% kill.
[02:05:05.142 --> 02:05:09.866]  Health and well-being can be achieved by using the all-natural Urban Spice products from North American Urban Spice.

[02:05:23.736 --> 02:05:29.362]  The herbal medicine has the exact frequency, the exact chemistry to kill any germ.

[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:53.062]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.662 --> 02:05:56.703]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:57.763 --> 02:05:59.543]  And it's 12 seconds into this third hour.
[02:05:59.563 --> 02:06:00.944]  We've got about 51 minutes left here.
[02:06:00.984 --> 02:06:06.785]  Declan McCullough writes for CNET News and a squadron of other major publications.
[02:06:06.825 --> 02:06:13.387]  He actually read the Real ID Act, like Ron Paul did, and can actually tell you what it said and what the Senate passed last night.
[02:06:14.187 --> 02:06:15.488]  Doesn't stop the illegal aliens.
[02:06:15.928 --> 02:06:22.831]  It turns us into a Pan-American Union and tracks and traces and grand databases and microchips and everything else.
[02:06:23.451 --> 02:06:25.132]  We'll be talking to Declan here in just one moment.
[02:06:25.592 --> 02:06:29.113]  Right now, though, Tim in Ohio just brought something up, and we've now found the article.
[02:06:29.173 --> 02:06:29.554]  It's true.
[02:06:29.574 --> 02:06:32.575]  We're going to get the video and play the audio of this.
[02:06:33.795 --> 02:06:35.056]  And I'd heard they were doing this.
[02:06:35.914 --> 02:06:39.279]  And I had seen video in other newscasts where they literally hang over the kids.
[02:06:39.299 --> 02:06:40.261]  They're allowed in the schools.
[02:06:40.622 --> 02:06:41.202]  They push them.
[02:06:41.223 --> 02:06:41.843]  They intimidate them.
[02:06:41.864 --> 02:06:42.785]  They go, aren't you a man?
[02:06:43.146 --> 02:06:43.987]  They harass them.
[02:06:44.007 --> 02:06:44.868]  I've talked to young people.
[02:06:44.888 --> 02:06:46.731]  They just call them ten times a day some days.
[02:06:47.152 --> 02:06:47.633]  Follow them.
[02:06:47.713 --> 02:06:48.514]  Show up at their house.
[02:06:48.975 --> 02:06:49.395]  Sign it.
[02:06:49.435 --> 02:06:49.816]  Sign it.
[02:06:49.856 --> 02:06:50.156]  Sign it.
[02:06:50.177 --> 02:06:50.978]  You're going to get in trouble.
[02:06:51.744 --> 02:06:54.686]  But I didn't know that they were threatening them to arrest them.
[02:06:55.087 --> 02:06:56.728]  But this is what government does.
[02:06:56.748 --> 02:06:58.610]  And believe me, they don't do this unless they're told to.
[02:06:58.890 --> 02:06:59.390]  It's criminal.
[02:07:00.451 --> 02:07:01.372]  Now, Tim, you're right.
[02:07:01.412 --> 02:07:02.833]  This is stalking children.
[02:07:03.033 --> 02:07:04.254]  This is what stalking is.
[02:07:04.334 --> 02:07:06.816]  Do what I say, or you're in trouble.
[02:07:06.897 --> 02:07:08.258]  Stalkers always do this.
[02:07:09.098 --> 02:07:09.879]  Tell us more about it.
[02:07:10.419 --> 02:07:12.481]  Oh, he was interested in going into the Army.
[02:07:12.921 --> 02:07:15.444]  He had made contact with a recruiter.
[02:07:16.524 --> 02:07:18.986]  And his name was Sergeant Thomas Kelt.
[02:07:19.087 --> 02:07:20.067]  We can't say that enough.
[02:07:21.278 --> 02:07:22.960]  And then he had a baby.
[02:07:23.581 --> 02:07:26.805]  And he wanted to go be a volunteer firefighter and turn that into a career.
[02:07:27.005 --> 02:07:30.069]  So he called back the recruiter and said he wasn't going to come to the appointment.
[02:07:30.770 --> 02:07:38.680]  And the quote that was on the website from this guy Kelt was, by federal law, you got an appointment with me at 2 o'clock this afternoon at Greens Point Mall.
[02:07:39.204 --> 02:07:41.905]  If you fail to appear, we'll have a warrant.
[02:07:42.185 --> 02:07:42.565]  Okay?
[02:07:42.605 --> 02:07:43.906]  So call me back.
[02:07:44.386 --> 02:07:48.168]  And in fear... And he's so arrogant, he then turns to the camera guy and goes, oh, that's just a tactic.
[02:07:48.468 --> 02:07:48.628]  Right.
[02:07:48.648 --> 02:07:50.769]  Well, he wouldn't even... I don't think he said that to them.
[02:07:50.829 --> 02:07:53.210]  He told that to Chris, the recruit.
[02:07:53.230 --> 02:07:54.170]  He said, don't worry about that.
[02:07:54.210 --> 02:07:55.531]  That's just a marketing technique.
[02:07:55.891 --> 02:08:00.533]  And when the reporter, I think it was... KHOU.
[02:08:00.573 --> 02:08:01.773]  KHOU in Houston.
[02:08:01.813 --> 02:08:03.054]  Yeah, I re-questioned him about it.
[02:08:03.842 --> 02:08:06.263]  He said, I'd like to know... His name was Greenblatt, the reporter.
[02:08:06.303 --> 02:08:13.385]  He said, I'd just like to know... I mean, why do we trust... We put our kids in these public schools where recruiters hang over them, where they're going to do forced psychological testing and drugging.
[02:08:13.405 --> 02:08:16.525]  That's now passing the legislature with federal funds.
[02:08:17.086 --> 02:08:23.687]  And we put them in there where they've got to go through frisk searches and drug dogs and drug testing the feds want to have mandatory.
[02:08:24.007 --> 02:08:26.568]  I mean, we're putting our children in mind-control prisons.
[02:08:27.468 --> 02:08:28.149]  It's unbelievable.
[02:08:28.389 --> 02:08:29.709]  Anyway, the battalion commander...
[02:08:30.209 --> 02:08:32.210]  His name is Lieutenant Colonel Jones.
[02:08:32.250 --> 02:08:35.392]  I hope it's no relation to him.
[02:08:35.472 --> 02:08:41.856]  And his number is 281-448-3785.
[02:08:43.397 --> 02:08:48.080]  After calling that number... That's 281-448-3785?
[02:08:48.261 --> 02:08:48.721]  Yes.
[02:08:48.821 --> 02:08:50.262]  Lieutenant Colonel Jones.
[02:08:50.422 --> 02:08:52.323]  And he's the battalion commander.
[02:08:53.024 --> 02:08:55.005]  After trying to get through to him, they wouldn't.
[02:08:55.025 --> 02:08:56.606]  Then they sent me to this public affairs...
[02:08:57.442 --> 02:09:00.044]  Gentlemen, Bill Grime is his name.
[02:09:00.184 --> 02:09:02.685]  G-R-I-M-E-F.
[02:09:03.406 --> 02:09:09.209]  And his phone number, 713-209-3220.
[02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.790]  All right.
[02:09:12.310 --> 02:09:13.131]  Good job.
[02:09:13.271 --> 02:09:14.712]  Good job with that tip, Tim.
[02:09:14.732 --> 02:09:16.072]  Appreciate that.
[02:09:16.193 --> 02:09:18.214]  I want to thank you for coming on.
[02:09:18.274 --> 02:09:18.614]  All right.
[02:09:19.754 --> 02:09:24.117]  Let's now go to Declan McCullough from CNET News and a bunch of other publications.
[02:09:27.063 --> 02:09:28.784]  Declan, it's good to have you on with us, my friend.
[02:09:29.344 --> 02:09:30.304]  A pleasure.
[02:09:30.345 --> 02:09:31.325]  Thank you for having me.
[02:09:31.545 --> 02:09:34.206]  Boy, that sounds fun, having the recruiters threaten to arrest you.
[02:09:36.367 --> 02:09:37.507]  You called that one right.
[02:09:38.087 --> 02:09:40.848]  Not a very good time, in my opinion.
[02:09:41.889 --> 02:09:48.111]  It sounds like the old British press gangs, where they just come out and grab you and kidnap you to put you on the ship.
[02:09:49.105 --> 02:09:53.668]  Well, I mean, this is the broader problem of unaccountable government officials.
[02:09:53.688 --> 02:09:59.551]  I mean, if they can't be sued for their actions, they're certainly not going to be criminally prosecuted by other government officials.
[02:09:59.651 --> 02:10:08.316]  It's very difficult to hold them accountable, and it creates these incentives to basically stray outside the bounds of normal behavior.
[02:10:08.336 --> 02:10:11.938]  Well, it's like when you take the restrictions off government, it's like dropping a bowling ball.
[02:10:11.978 --> 02:10:12.738]  It's going to fall.
[02:10:13.058 --> 02:10:14.039]  We're going to have tyranny.
[02:10:15.199 --> 02:10:17.761]  That's the way it's always ended up throughout history.
[02:10:19.255 --> 02:10:22.836]  Well, but the government means well this time, Declan.
[02:10:22.856 --> 02:10:29.239]  Declan, tell us about your personal website, and then let's get into what this real ID really did.
[02:10:30.059 --> 02:10:31.240]  Sure.
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:34.861]  I run a mailing list called Polytech.
[02:10:34.921 --> 02:10:41.004]  You can see it at polytechbot.com, P-O-L-Y-T-E-C-H-B-O-T dot com.
[02:10:41.044 --> 02:10:43.985]  But my day job is as a reporter and columnist for Polytech.
[02:10:44.372 --> 02:10:46.715]  Well, we've been all over it, like flies on...
[02:11:05.166 --> 02:11:14.570]  On the shish kebab, I mean, we have been everywhere on this subject, and there have been a bunch of different versions of it, but when you really read it, it doesn't stop the illegal aliens.
[02:11:14.610 --> 02:11:17.712]  It accepts their fake ID cards issued by their consulates.
[02:11:17.752 --> 02:11:19.552]  It makes a Pan-American Union ID.
[02:11:19.913 --> 02:11:22.914]  He wrote the article, Real ID Act Links Canada-Mexico Database.
[02:11:23.334 --> 02:11:26.978]  Well, the truth is that, as you know and your readers probably know by now,
[02:11:44.059 --> 02:11:47.861]  I mean, there are two different types of Republicans in D.C.
[02:11:47.901 --> 02:11:48.882]  nowadays.
[02:11:48.982 --> 02:12:04.231]  There are the ones who are more libertarian-leaning or more true conservatives, folks like Representative Ron Paul, who I have a lot of respect for, that actually have some principles and don't believe in either a huge sweeping expanse of federal government.
[02:12:04.271 --> 02:12:09.594]  And the other types are the ones that are in it more to advance their careers and
[02:12:10.253 --> 02:12:10.733]  It's incredible, but...
[02:12:28.365 --> 02:12:35.590]  I mean, Ron Paul wrote the article where he described it as a Trojan horse and that it didn't really stop illegals, but people didn't actually look at the facts.
[02:12:35.650 --> 02:12:36.850]  They just believed the propaganda.
[02:12:37.171 --> 02:12:43.955]  What are your problems with this new legislation due to be signed by our great, dear leader very soon?
[02:12:45.175 --> 02:12:49.218]  Yes, our maximal leader will sign this probably in the next week or two.
[02:12:49.318 --> 02:12:53.961]  As you readers know by now, the Senate cleared it yesterday, and the House already has signed
[02:12:54.746 --> 02:12:59.694]  The sad thing is, let's first talk about the procedure before talking about the details.
[02:12:59.734 --> 02:13:05.885]  And the procedure is pretty interesting because this cleared the House by around a 250 to 150 vote, roughly.
[02:13:08.087 --> 02:13:14.171]  And so that means that if 50 members of Congress would have swapped their votes, it would not have cleared the House.
[02:13:14.632 --> 02:13:17.154]  And so it wasn't really a slam dunk.
[02:13:17.254 --> 02:13:22.577]  If 50 people, roughly maybe 10% of Congress would have swapped, it wouldn't have gone through.
[02:13:22.818 --> 02:13:25.980]  And so I'm expected to run into some problems in the Senate.
[02:13:26.000 --> 02:13:28.021]  You know, senators were threatened to put holds on it.
[02:13:28.462 --> 02:13:30.003]  It's easier to block stuff in the Senate.
[02:13:30.123 --> 02:13:37.488]  And so what Representative Sensenbrenner, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, a Republican from Wisconsin, said is,
[02:13:37.868 --> 02:13:38.789]  Hey, I've got a great idea.
[02:13:38.809 --> 02:13:44.955]  Let's stick this on this Musk passed $80 billion Iraq spending bill.
[02:13:45.335 --> 02:13:48.398]  And that's why I cleared the Senate without any dissenting votes last night.
[02:13:51.721 --> 02:13:53.282]  And it's going on to the President.
[02:13:53.423 --> 02:14:00.329]  But getting into details of the bill itself, let's talk about how it merges the database with Mexico and Canada.
[02:14:01.405 --> 02:14:02.607]  Right.
[02:14:02.647 --> 02:14:03.549]  That's just the beginning.
[02:14:03.569 --> 02:14:06.655]  It's not just an ID bill.
[02:14:07.456 --> 02:14:11.644]  That might be sort of shocking enough, but it also is
[02:14:13.181 --> 02:14:16.062]  A database bill, and let's pay attention to that for a moment.
[02:14:16.142 --> 02:14:20.722]  This codifies the Total Information Awareness Network and systems like the Matrix.
[02:14:21.243 --> 02:14:21.683]  It could.
[02:14:22.583 --> 02:14:24.283]  In fairness, we don't know the details.
[02:14:24.883 --> 02:14:38.286]  If the Department of Homeland Security decides to have a change of heart tomorrow and say, you know, we actually want to believe in limited government and the Constitution and Americans' privacy, they actually could make this... So the Easter bunnies start flying around.
[02:14:39.866 --> 02:14:44.450]  The Department of Homeland Security has a tremendous amount of flexibility in deciding the details here.
[02:14:44.470 --> 02:14:53.496]  Basically, Congress... That's what's scary, is it... Did that really bad provision ever get taken out that said that it gives the president unlimited authority to nullify laws?
[02:14:54.497 --> 02:14:58.700]  Actually, the Department of Homeland Security has unlimited authority, but no, that's still in there.
[02:14:58.900 --> 02:15:00.061]  Yeah, well, that's still there.
[02:15:00.221 --> 02:15:01.562]  Oh, okay.
[02:15:01.682 --> 02:15:03.443]  Laws relating to the border, and so...
[02:15:05.758 --> 02:15:06.279]  Where were we?
[02:15:06.299 --> 02:15:07.800]  So we're talking about the database.
[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:08.860]  And we've seen what they've done.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:13.442]  When Congress passed 2,000 more Border Patrol, last year Bush then took that money away.
[02:15:14.063 --> 02:15:15.784]  So we see where his heart is.
[02:15:16.184 --> 02:15:17.685]  Give free health care to the illegals.
[02:15:17.745 --> 02:15:18.785]  Give tuition to them.
[02:15:19.085 --> 02:15:19.866]  Don't stop them.
[02:15:19.906 --> 02:15:20.746]  Blanket amnesty.
[02:15:21.046 --> 02:15:23.588]  And people really thought Bush would stop the illegals with his bill.
[02:15:24.508 --> 02:15:27.189]  Well, it's just like the Patriot Act.
[02:15:27.229 --> 02:15:28.250]  You stick a good-sounding...
[02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:31.802]  It's more in the spin than the reality.
[02:15:31.822 --> 02:15:36.906]  Very few members of Congress, I think, actually read these things, and now that it was attached to a spending bill, it's going to go through.
[02:15:36.966 --> 02:15:39.268]  But in terms of the database aspects of this, it's
[02:15:53.371 --> 02:15:58.413]  It requires state DMVs, the motor vehicle agencies, to share information.
[02:15:58.433 --> 02:15:59.453]  I'm quoting from the bill now.
[02:15:59.473 --> 02:16:06.496]  It says that they must, quote, provide electronic access by a state to information contained in the motor vehicle databases of all other states.
[02:16:06.636 --> 02:16:12.818]  And so some states already were sharing information, but this creates effectively a national database.
[02:16:13.382 --> 02:16:17.244]  The big privacy worry, though, is not just, okay, here's my ID card.
[02:16:17.264 --> 02:16:18.564]  It has my name on it, whatever.
[02:16:18.904 --> 02:16:20.545]  It's got a driver's license with it.
[02:16:20.565 --> 02:16:22.966]  The big privacy worry... This isn't just a national ID card.
[02:16:23.006 --> 02:16:28.629]  This is a literal file, the equivalent of an FBI file, we'll all carry.
[02:16:29.569 --> 02:16:29.789]  Right.
[02:16:30.249 --> 02:16:31.430]  Because right now...
[02:16:32.396 --> 02:16:35.339]  If you look at different state driver's licenses, they're not standardized.
[02:16:35.499 --> 02:16:37.321]  This is federalism.
[02:16:37.361 --> 02:16:37.842]  It's wonderful.
[02:16:37.862 --> 02:16:47.231]  It's actually protected our privacy because they don't have one mag stripe on the back or one biometric fingerprint or retinal scan embedded in a standard place in each one.
[02:16:48.472 --> 02:16:54.438]  What's happened is that government agencies haven't been able to create standard ID card readers.
[02:16:56.756 --> 02:16:59.900]  That these different formats... Some don't have any barcodes at all.
[02:16:59.920 --> 02:17:04.165]  I mean, I live in Washington, D.C., and we don't have any barcode on ours.
[02:17:04.466 --> 02:17:11.335]  But once it's standardized, and once the Department of Homeland Security creates this uniform national ID...
[02:17:12.128 --> 02:17:16.649]  Then it's going to be very easy for these ID card readers to pop up all over the place.
[02:17:17.169 --> 02:17:24.210]  You can think of it, any government agency... Well, I've got the other federal plans, Declan, where they're going to use it for the national sales tax, tracking everything we buy and sell and do.
[02:17:24.731 --> 02:17:29.992]  The Commerce Department wants to use it for a fat tax to see what you're eating and what you're doing.
[02:17:30.052 --> 02:17:31.352]  I mean, this is a nightmare.
[02:17:31.592 --> 02:17:32.612]  Stranger things have happened.
[02:17:33.592 --> 02:17:37.193]  Well, they're coming out now that our air conditioners will be remote controlled by the feds.
[02:17:37.233 --> 02:17:38.033]  I'm sure you saw that.
[02:17:39.014 --> 02:17:40.074]  Wall Street Journal today.
[02:17:40.114 --> 02:17:40.754]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:40.774 --> 02:17:41.154]  Stay with us.
[02:17:46.468 --> 02:17:49.370]  Pope John Paul II is already being acclaimed a saint.
[02:17:49.511 --> 02:17:52.833]  During his 26 years, he canonized 482 saints.
[02:17:52.973 --> 02:17:55.035]  The one saint that stands out in my mind is St.
[02:17:55.075 --> 02:17:57.918]  Maria Faustina, a poor, uneducated Polish nun.
[02:17:58.058 --> 02:18:04.303]  Christ appeared to her over 100 times in the 1930s and instructed her to keep a diary of the message he wanted to give to the world.
[02:18:04.463 --> 02:18:07.886]  This message is nothing new, just a reminder of what the Church has always taught.
[02:18:08.266 --> 02:18:13.688]  That God is merciful and forgiving, excluding no one, and that we too must show mercy and forgiveness to our neighbor.
[02:18:13.848 --> 02:18:17.749]  Christ promises to grant unimaginable favors to those that trust in his mercy.
[02:18:17.969 --> 02:18:18.690]  Trust Jesus.
[02:18:18.850 --> 02:18:21.150]  He will reveal his love in all aspects of your life.
[02:18:21.491 --> 02:18:25.772]  I've experienced the power of divine mercy and know the miracles that have taken place in my life.
[02:18:26.052 --> 02:18:28.893]  Christ will pour out his mercy and love to you in great abundance.
[02:18:29.113 --> 02:18:32.495]  I'll send you a free booklet so that you too can learn more about Divine Mercy.

[02:18:47.452 --> 02:18:48.494]  The war on terrorism.
[02:18:48.794 --> 02:18:51.598]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:18:51.858 --> 02:18:56.024]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:18:56.444 --> 02:18:57.285]  So what do you do?
[02:18:57.606 --> 02:19:02.172]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:19:02.632 --> 02:19:04.773]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:19:52.592 --> 02:19:54.935]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[02:21:28.882 --> 02:21:31.463]  Here's the Associated Press headline.
[02:21:31.503 --> 02:21:31.583]  U.S.
[02:21:31.603 --> 02:21:34.223]  states may disobey new rules on driver's licenses.
[02:21:55.433 --> 02:21:56.553]  Then here's the disinfo.
[02:21:56.654 --> 02:21:56.874]  U.S.
[02:21:56.894 --> 02:22:05.097]  states are threatening to challenge in court or even disobey new orders from Congress to make driver's licenses more uniform and to verify applicant citizenship or legal status.
[02:22:05.797 --> 02:22:10.119]  Ron Pohl wrote, Proponents of the Real ID Act, now passed, the Senate and House,
[02:22:10.842 --> 02:22:16.065]  Continue to make their preposterous claim that the bill does not establish a national ID card.
[02:22:16.085 --> 02:22:18.026]  This is a dangerous and insulting nonsense.
[02:22:18.466 --> 02:22:19.507]  Let's get the facts straight.
[02:22:19.527 --> 02:22:23.769]  The REAL ID Act transforms state motor vehicle departments into agents of the federal government.
[02:22:24.289 --> 02:22:29.812]  Nationalizing standards for driver's licenses and birth certificates in a federal bill creates a national ID system.
[02:22:29.852 --> 02:22:35.535]  Folks, in 93, they started taking digital photos and digital thumbprints to get a driver's license in Texas.
[02:22:36.056 --> 02:22:40.278]  Most states have these, and the data is uploaded to federal databases in the NCIC.
[02:22:41.167 --> 02:22:44.809]  This just makes it the law and then makes them put the latest technology in.
[02:22:45.170 --> 02:22:50.733]  It's all the whim of the president's appointee, Michael Chertoff.
[02:22:53.475 --> 02:23:03.241]  And basically, talking to Ron Paul on air a few months ago about this, and we've got him coming on tomorrow, the way it's written up, Homeland Security can do whatever they want.
[02:23:03.561 --> 02:23:08.304]  And Homeland Security has already said, the illegals have just got to show a consular matricula.
[02:23:09.005 --> 02:23:09.505]  And they get it.
[02:23:10.552 --> 02:23:11.633]  It'll be selectively enforced.
[02:23:12.233 --> 02:23:13.673]  And then you're going to have to show five forms.
[02:23:14.634 --> 02:23:17.695]  It's just like when you're at the bank and you see the illegal go up there with nothing and get a bank account.
[02:23:18.075 --> 02:23:19.936]  You've got to show three or four forms.
[02:23:20.776 --> 02:23:27.359]  I was here in Austin when Vicente Fox came here and gave Wells Fargo an award for not making their people have IDs.
[02:23:28.380 --> 02:23:29.540]  See, it's all selective.
[02:23:29.580 --> 02:23:36.203]  And Ron Paul goes on in his article, Last Chance to Stop National ID from Yesterday, and talks about that.
[02:23:37.132 --> 02:23:44.459]  But Declan McCullough, again, with CNET News and other major publications, has written some detailed articles about this.
[02:23:44.559 --> 02:23:49.784]  Pan-American Union ID, starting out with America and the U.S.
[02:23:49.824 --> 02:23:56.170]  and Canada, the United States, Canada, and New Mexico, and just expanding out from there.
[02:23:56.210 --> 02:23:57.191]  Declan, please continue.
[02:23:57.972 --> 02:24:02.396]  So, I mean, we're talking about information sharing and databases, but
[02:24:03.928 --> 02:24:11.949]  One thing that I'm worried about is what happens to the information that's not the information on the card, but the information...
[02:24:12.980 --> 02:24:15.663]  That's collected every time you show the card to someone.
[02:24:15.683 --> 02:24:18.165]  You show the card to someone, they swipe it in their reader.
[02:24:18.665 --> 02:24:26.171]  Maybe it's a policeman in a car that pulled you over for... And that's already going in the police cars under federal funding.
[02:24:26.211 --> 02:24:26.371]  Right.
[02:24:26.631 --> 02:24:28.433]  The stores are already getting ready to do it.
[02:24:28.533 --> 02:24:30.334]  Maybe it's the stores.
[02:24:30.515 --> 02:24:38.661]  I mean, you know that everyone lies, at least I do, I admit, when I get these discount cards at the grocery store.
[02:24:38.681 --> 02:24:39.862]  Why do they even know my real name?
[02:24:40.262 --> 02:24:41.283]  But all they can say now...
[02:24:42.782 --> 02:24:45.103]  Well, it's just tied to your real ID card.
[02:24:45.823 --> 02:24:54.527]  Banks, courthouses, pretty much any time you do anything relating to the government, they can have a trail of your movement.
[02:24:54.587 --> 02:24:56.527]  And that's the real danger of the national ID card.
[02:24:56.547 --> 02:25:02.169]  But the border's going to stay wide open, and we're going to pay for the illegal aliens' health care, and we're going to give them double tuition.
[02:25:02.770 --> 02:25:05.791]  We want amnesty for them, but this is to stop illegals.
[02:25:06.471 --> 02:25:08.956]  Total smoke and mirrors, folks.
[02:25:09.016 --> 02:25:11.080]  And I told the anti-immigration crowd this.
[02:25:11.440 --> 02:25:12.603]  They were fooled again.
[02:25:12.623 --> 02:25:16.049]  Declan, would you agree that they were the ones responsible for getting this passed?
[02:25:17.228 --> 02:25:18.329]  In large part, yes.
[02:25:18.349 --> 02:25:26.673]  There's sort of an alliance of convenience right now between the anti-immigration folks and the biometric sellers.
[02:25:26.793 --> 02:25:36.938]  And the biometric sellers, and also sort of the security folks here in D.C., the neocons, Homeland Security, Uber, all that type of thing.
[02:25:36.979 --> 02:25:37.759]  That's tied in.
[02:25:37.779 --> 02:25:43.422]  I mean, we can boil that down to military industrial complex having a new market here in America.
[02:25:44.422 --> 02:25:45.363]  That's a large part of it.
[02:25:46.832 --> 02:25:49.014]  I've covered these conferences.
[02:25:50.855 --> 02:25:56.658]  You have these biometric conferences that take place in Washington, D.C., and they're huge.
[02:25:56.698 --> 02:26:05.704]  They take over something the size of multiple gymnasiums, and it's all sellers showing off ID cards to government agencies.
[02:26:05.784 --> 02:26:06.945]  It's a matchmaking session.
[02:26:07.525 --> 02:26:09.006]  There's a lot of money kicking around here.
[02:26:10.436 --> 02:26:18.806]  Yeah, a lot of the people in the Bush administration and chief Democrats, you know, their wife or their cousin or they themselves, just a year ago were, you know, CEO of the company.
[02:26:18.846 --> 02:26:22.291]  And surprise, surprise, they're giving their own company big contracts.
[02:26:24.273 --> 02:26:25.774]  The revolving door continues.
[02:26:26.094 --> 02:26:27.295]  And here's something else.
[02:26:27.695 --> 02:26:35.581]  It's not just the ID card that's the problem, but what is on the card in terms of biometric info.
[02:26:35.601 --> 02:26:37.163]  The face scan, yeah.
[02:26:37.283 --> 02:26:39.164]  Is it going to be your face?
[02:26:39.344 --> 02:26:40.525]  Is it going to be your fingerprint?
[02:26:40.545 --> 02:26:41.566]  Is it going to be your retinal ID?
[02:26:41.626 --> 02:26:43.708]  Is it going to be a DNA scan?
[02:26:44.409 --> 02:26:48.555]  The Homeland Security Department has the power to do any of that kind of stuff.
[02:26:48.576 --> 02:26:54.906]  By the way, you know Clinton signed an executive order for blood testing when you get a driver's license, and it never got challenged.
[02:26:54.926 --> 02:26:57.630]  Did you know that's already law, but they never implemented DECLA?
[02:26:57.851 --> 02:26:58.572]  I did not know that.
[02:26:59.147 --> 02:27:01.289]  It's in my first film, America Destroyed by Design.
[02:27:01.329 --> 02:27:01.630]  Yes, sir.
[02:27:01.930 --> 02:27:03.091]  Here's one more thing.
[02:27:03.652 --> 02:27:07.476]  RFIDs, Radio Frequency Identification Tags.
[02:27:07.976 --> 02:27:10.559]  Homeland Security loves these items.
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:13.883]  And they're trying to use them...
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:16.040]  Another context.
[02:27:16.120 --> 02:27:21.041]  And so the question is whether they're going to stick these on these real ID cards.
[02:27:21.141 --> 02:27:26.202]  And so that's even more interesting because now the government can have detectors along the street.
[02:27:26.222 --> 02:27:28.883]  You walk by them, they can see who you are.
[02:27:29.083 --> 02:27:30.203]  Jack, look, stay there.
[02:27:30.223 --> 02:27:31.544]  I want to do one more segment with you.
[02:27:31.784 --> 02:27:34.064]  Then we'll take calls and play that CBS News piece.
[02:27:36.205 --> 02:27:37.105]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.585 --> 02:27:39.205]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.105 --> 02:27:42.786]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.213 --> 02:27:48.374]  All water isn't the same.
[02:27:48.634 --> 02:27:53.636]  Scientific research in the past two decades which studied water has produced some startling new information.
[02:27:53.896 --> 02:27:56.498]  Water is not just some simple liquid that we happen to drink.
[02:27:56.698 --> 02:28:05.242]  Because our body is composed of 75% water, drinking energized water adds pure light frequency that can help cleanse and help alleviate most health problems.
[02:28:05.622 --> 02:28:14.045]  Aquanorthwest.com carries a full line of products that will increase the water's energy by creating a positive spin and revitalizing water in a high vibration state.
[02:28:14.185 --> 02:28:17.626]  For example, Aquanorthwest.com offers an energy gel mug.
[02:28:17.886 --> 02:28:25.309]  Simply place any liquid in the energy gel mug and in just minutes your water is positively charged and ready to enter your body in the most impressionable state.

[02:28:47.445 --> 02:28:49.465]  Those that receive it will receive the wrath of God.

[02:29:15.194 --> 02:29:18.797]  Want to know the secret to finding a shop that can keep your car running like new?
[02:29:18.977 --> 02:29:22.900]  Find the cleanest shop in town, where cleaning is top priority.
[02:29:23.041 --> 02:29:26.543]  Not talking about clean floors, but better shops have those too.
[02:29:26.924 --> 02:29:34.510]  I mean shops that have the best training, equipment, and chemistry to clean every air, fuel, and fluid system in your vehicle.
[02:29:34.790 --> 02:29:38.073]  Keep it clean, and you don't have to keep replacing parts.
[02:29:38.493 --> 02:29:42.156]  Find your clean shop at bgfindashop.com.
[02:29:42.396 --> 02:29:44.538]  That's bgfindashop.com.
[02:29:45.558 --> 02:29:51.825]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:29:51.945 --> 02:29:58.111]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:29:58.391 --> 02:30:06.780]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:30:07.060 --> 02:30:14.106]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:30:14.387 --> 02:30:19.231]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:30:19.431 --> 02:30:28.219]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs, ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:30:28.599 --> 02:30:36.501]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69, or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:30:36.581 --> 02:30:37.282]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:30:37.342 --> 02:30:40.422]  Got some really important news we haven't covered.
[02:30:40.463 --> 02:30:41.523]  I'm going to hit briefly.
[02:30:41.603 --> 02:30:41.863]  Sure.
[02:30:56.744 --> 02:30:59.286]  Recap news from the first hour, really big stories.
[02:31:00.006 --> 02:31:11.793]  I'm going to play this little two-minute CBS news clip to analyze it, where they're just coming right out with the military threatening people federally with arrests if they don't show up at the recruitment office.
[02:31:12.434 --> 02:31:13.935]  Don't worry, they'll nuke a city soon.
[02:31:15.009 --> 02:31:20.033]  A globalist will then have their national draft and tell us that we're all their slaves to, you know, fight Al-Seaida.
[02:31:20.453 --> 02:31:21.634]  Going back to Declan McCullough.
[02:31:21.654 --> 02:31:25.436]  Declan, give folks the website where they can read all your great analysis.
[02:31:25.456 --> 02:31:28.238]  I think your personal website is the best place.
[02:31:28.438 --> 02:31:29.839]  Give us that web address again.
[02:31:29.859 --> 02:31:32.061]  Sure, it's politechbot.com.
[02:31:32.221 --> 02:31:36.824]  P-O-L-I-T-E-C-H-B-O-T dot com.
[02:31:37.605 --> 02:31:40.827]  And we've got multiple links on infoatwars.com, dear excellent stories.
[02:31:41.848 --> 02:31:41.928]  Uh...
[02:31:43.078 --> 02:31:48.119]  Look, the Total Information Awareness Network, run by the five-time felon, never really got shut down.
[02:31:48.159 --> 02:31:48.939]  That's been in the news.
[02:31:48.999 --> 02:31:49.959]  I think you reported on it.
[02:31:50.559 --> 02:31:52.300]  It's still running up there in D.C.
[02:31:52.680 --> 02:31:57.280]  They've got it with the Matrix program in Florida as a test case, and they call it the Matrix, folks.
[02:31:57.320 --> 02:31:58.861]  They're flaunting this.
[02:31:59.341 --> 02:32:02.281]  They say everything you do will be tracked and traced, everything you buy.
[02:32:02.361 --> 02:32:06.782]  I've read federal documents where they say it will be integrated with the new national sales tax.
[02:32:07.122 --> 02:32:10.863]  You'll have to swipe your card because it will be a graduated sales tax.
[02:32:10.883 --> 02:32:11.683]  Can't have you cheating.
[02:32:12.375 --> 02:32:14.856]  We're having a surrogate byproduct who's in a lower bracket.
[02:32:15.757 --> 02:32:16.837]  This is their grid.
[02:32:17.097 --> 02:32:24.140]  I saw Ridge on C-SPAN three years ago say, the old Homeland Security Ed, we're going to have to have this to have jobs anywhere.
[02:32:24.200 --> 02:32:25.621]  It's called infrastructure protection.
[02:32:26.441 --> 02:32:35.145]  Homeland Security's gone after people that sell Rubik's Cubes at their toy stores, people that make too many complaints to the VA, pot dealers, topless bars.
[02:32:35.245 --> 02:32:36.506]  Everything's terrorism now.
[02:32:38.271 --> 02:32:41.494]  Plus, there's already this false data in these big databases.
[02:32:41.514 --> 02:32:42.855]  They're just talking about making them bigger.
[02:32:45.058 --> 02:32:59.211]  The danger is that there's no logical, at least in the security establishment's logic, end to the types of restrictions that can be levied on Americans in the name of Homeland Security.
[02:32:59.231 --> 02:33:01.353]  This bill is a blank check for those that don't know.
[02:33:02.211 --> 02:33:13.640]  It gives sweeping, in some cases unreviewable by the courts, power to the Department of Homeland Security to pretty much do whatever they want.
[02:33:13.700 --> 02:33:19.365]  So it's really light years ahead of an ID card, of a national ID card.
[02:33:19.725 --> 02:33:22.247]  It goes far beyond the national ID card, yeah.
[02:33:24.509 --> 02:33:28.432]  But the illegal aliens are all going to have special little loopholes for themselves, and
[02:33:29.528 --> 02:33:35.730]  And then finally conservatives will figure this out in a year, they'll complain, they'll go, okay, we'll pass another law.
[02:33:36.310 --> 02:33:38.631]  You've got to have it on you at all times or you go to prison.
[02:33:38.951 --> 02:33:44.132]  Well, the current Republicans, yeah, you might well be right, the current Republicans in power in D.C.
[02:33:44.152 --> 02:33:45.532]  have done a very smart thing.
[02:33:45.853 --> 02:33:51.854]  They've used the rhetoric of small government conservatives while expanding the power of the government substantially.
[02:33:52.334 --> 02:33:57.896]  And so if you just listen to what they say, let's stop illegal aliens, let's have lower taxes, let's have more freedom...
[02:33:58.857 --> 02:34:02.960]  It sounds great, but if you actually look at how they vote, that's a different story.
[02:34:03.700 --> 02:34:05.441]  Well, it was like campaign finance reform.
[02:34:05.501 --> 02:34:16.989]  It doubled the money that corporations can give, restricts individuals like us, and then now they're trying to claim the rules, give them the power to regulate political blogs run by one guy.
[02:34:17.009 --> 02:34:19.211]  It's true.
[02:34:19.231 --> 02:34:22.192]  The FEC is in the middle of trying to figure that out right now.
[02:34:22.793 --> 02:34:25.515]  And they might actually do the right thing, but only because...
[02:34:26.563 --> 02:34:31.045]  There was a tremendous outcry among bloggers about that.
[02:34:31.485 --> 02:34:35.247]  Well, San Francisco wants to regulate and tax all political websites.
[02:34:35.527 --> 02:34:36.728]  Oh, this is San Francisco.
[02:34:38.368 --> 02:34:42.590]  But notice, it's the so-called liberals that love all this boshonian garbage.
[02:34:43.351 --> 02:34:44.091]  It's true.
[02:34:44.351 --> 02:34:48.073]  And you can imagine, you have another security incident...
[02:34:48.786 --> 02:34:49.286]  We're good to go.
[02:35:18.887 --> 02:35:20.808]  But nevertheless, everything had to be evacuated.
[02:35:20.828 --> 02:35:23.090]  Let's go to Code Red and so on and so forth.
[02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:27.533]  It panics everyone so they can be more accepting of restrictions on liberty.
[02:35:27.553 --> 02:35:33.617]  Well, it's like on Election Day in England, the British Embassy has like a firecracker go off on a planter.
[02:35:34.377 --> 02:35:38.360]  And then yesterday, Bush bravely, a hand grenade was thrown at him.
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:40.861]  Turns out it's a training grenade, obviously.
[02:35:40.901 --> 02:35:42.842]  I mean, we know about the fake terror alerts, Declan.
[02:35:44.003 --> 02:35:45.264]  Declan McCullough, excuse me.
[02:35:46.515 --> 02:35:47.896]  I'm just ranting and raving here.
[02:35:47.956 --> 02:35:50.596]  I'm frothing because I can't believe we're seeing this happen.
[02:35:50.977 --> 02:35:51.317]  Declan?
[02:35:52.077 --> 02:35:56.178]  We're seeing sort of near, you can almost count on these terrorist alerts.
[02:35:56.218 --> 02:35:57.639]  Let's have a real ID card vote.
[02:35:57.659 --> 02:35:59.379]  Hey, time for a terrorist alert.
[02:35:59.959 --> 02:36:07.522]  Let's freak out all the members of Congress told to flee, flee for the hills by Secret Service agents and Capitol Police outside.
[02:36:08.338 --> 02:36:09.439]  The White House and the Capitol.
[02:36:09.459 --> 02:36:16.044]  Well, when they passed the first Patriot Act, most of the office buildings in the Capitol areas were shut down because of the anthrax attack.
[02:36:16.064 --> 02:36:18.566]  The Capitol office buildings, yeah, a number of those were shut down.
[02:36:18.586 --> 02:36:20.708]  But don't worry, Bush was on Cipro, so he was okay.
[02:36:23.556 --> 02:36:27.119]  Hey, Declan, can you put two and two together with that one?
[02:36:28.339 --> 02:36:28.980]  I know you can.
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:31.601]  You write for a major publication, so I don't expect you to say what you think.
[02:36:33.342 --> 02:36:36.044]  But back to today's Cessna attack.
[02:36:36.064 --> 02:36:44.829]  I mean, this is maybe straying a little far from our topic, but I'm in training to be a pilot, and I fly in the airspace around Washington, D.C., and fly with the procedures.
[02:36:45.396 --> 02:36:46.657]  It sounds like a restricted airspace.
[02:36:46.677 --> 02:36:55.404]  It's really small, but instead it actually is an hour drive in every direction from Washington all the way to the mountains in the west to the other side of the Chesapeake Bay to the east.
[02:36:55.644 --> 02:36:57.045]  So how far away was this plane?
[02:36:57.105 --> 02:36:58.787]  I'm hearing it was pretty far.
[02:36:58.807 --> 02:37:01.509]  Well, the White House press secretary said 10 miles.
[02:37:02.710 --> 02:37:05.352]  And so, I mean, if you figure this plane can do 110 miles an hour...
[02:37:07.321 --> 02:37:08.662]  That's assuming no headwind.
[02:37:08.722 --> 02:37:20.691]  I mean, they had plenty of time to do something, to shoot that plane down, but instead, or actually identify that it's a Cessna as opposed to a 747, but instead they decided to evacuate everyone instead.
[02:37:20.971 --> 02:37:24.713]  This is not a good way for the federal government to behave.
[02:37:24.994 --> 02:37:28.476]  But it's training the congressmen that they're under the control of the nice officers.
[02:37:28.756 --> 02:37:31.798]  It's training the congressmen and the public that...
[02:37:33.027 --> 02:37:34.668]  The security forces are in charge.
[02:37:35.188 --> 02:37:36.029]  And it's going to stay that way.
[02:37:36.489 --> 02:37:37.850]  And who's in charge of those?
[02:37:37.930 --> 02:37:39.831]  Our great maximum leader?
[02:37:41.752 --> 02:37:44.033]  You said it.
[02:37:44.073 --> 02:37:46.054]  Declan McCullough, when is it going to end?
[02:37:46.174 --> 02:37:49.656]  I mean, it's getting crazier and crazier and crazier.
[02:37:49.756 --> 02:37:54.339]  All these federal funds for face scanning cameras and microphones going up nationwide.
[02:37:54.919 --> 02:37:57.560]  But again, Bush says, tattle on your neighbors.
[02:37:57.620 --> 02:37:58.861]  FEMA puts out these handbooks.
[02:37:59.301 --> 02:38:01.162]  If a man and woman are arguing, call the police.
[02:38:01.202 --> 02:38:02.143]  That's in the terror handbook.
[02:38:02.183 --> 02:38:02.303]  But
[02:38:03.119 --> 02:38:07.800]  The Minutemen are evil because they're sitting in lawn chairs calling the Border Patrol.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.101]  They're bad, Bush says.
[02:38:09.541 --> 02:38:12.662]  Well, I mean, the government is a unique type of monopoly.
[02:38:12.702 --> 02:38:16.583]  It has a monopoly, and we're likely to believe it has, on the initiation of force.
[02:38:16.683 --> 02:38:18.743]  And so it's very jealous about this.
[02:38:18.803 --> 02:38:24.185]  Any time you try to basically protect yourself at the border the way that...
[02:38:25.277 --> 02:38:26.137]  The Minutemen were.
[02:38:26.377 --> 02:38:30.358]  Then all of a sudden, you need to have... The government gets jealous of that.
[02:38:30.418 --> 02:38:37.239]  But giving, in hundreds of schools, $200 discount credit cards to children when they report on mommy and daddy, that's good!
[02:38:37.439 --> 02:38:40.600]  But don't call the Border Patrol from your ranch!
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:41.420]  That's evil!
[02:38:43.320 --> 02:38:44.460]  Again, double standards.
[02:38:45.521 --> 02:38:49.601]  Well, it's making my head spin.
[02:38:49.821 --> 02:38:51.622]  The last question for you, Declan McCullough.
[02:38:52.102 --> 02:38:52.982]  The state's
[02:38:54.089 --> 02:38:55.891]  As I knew they would, are saying, we're not going to do this.
[02:38:55.911 --> 02:38:58.854]  And, of course, Bush will allow them to not go after the illegals.
[02:38:58.894 --> 02:39:00.155]  That's the part they're complaining about.
[02:39:00.215 --> 02:39:01.236]  What do you see happening with this?
[02:39:02.878 --> 02:39:04.739]  It's going to be a tough call.
[02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:08.083]  I have a call-in to the National Governors Association.
[02:39:08.103 --> 02:39:10.965]  I'm going to be writing about this for News.com later, I think.
[02:39:11.486 --> 02:39:17.091]  It's really a question of whether the states have the political mettle to stand up to the government, the Fed.
[02:39:18.252 --> 02:39:23.413]  I don't think it's really a question of, it's not like the feds or the states are standing up for our privacy or anything like that.
[02:39:23.633 --> 02:39:27.214]  It's more like they want to be the ones making the decisions to invade our privacy.
[02:39:27.254 --> 02:39:30.835]  And second, if the feds are going to make the decisions, the states want to get paid.
[02:39:31.075 --> 02:39:34.676]  If you give them a big enough check, they're going to roll over and say, yes, sir.
[02:39:35.516 --> 02:39:36.456]  So they're really asking for money.
[02:39:36.476 --> 02:39:38.276]  Well, they know it's like with Bush and the illegals.
[02:39:38.316 --> 02:39:40.077]  You're illegal, you get any surgery you want.
[02:39:40.557 --> 02:39:45.258]  I've got personal friends who can't get surgeries for life-threatening illnesses because they're citizens, Declan.
[02:39:47.721 --> 02:40:01.209]  The question is why we as taxpayers should, and folks who are hopefully being thrifty and saving money, why we should have to put the bill for anyone else's medical care.
[02:40:01.750 --> 02:40:07.053]  I just don't... Well, the bottom line is Bush has said he wants the borders open, he wants the illegals here.
[02:40:07.313 --> 02:40:10.735]  So the whole war on terror is a complete joke.
[02:40:10.815 --> 02:40:11.616]  Pretty much, yeah.
[02:40:11.636 --> 02:40:15.038]  When you can have such porous borders from the south, it becomes a...
[02:40:16.091 --> 02:40:22.293]  It's quite questionable whether the war on terror can reasonably be fought with open borders.
[02:40:22.413 --> 02:40:23.893]  Well, it's like the war on drugs.
[02:40:23.913 --> 02:40:35.317]  We've got more drugs than ever, and more people in prison, and building widgets for private companies, and now the feds want to drug test all the children at the same time, pushing prescription drugs on them with New Freedom Initiative.
[02:40:37.057 --> 02:40:39.578]  Again, it's a very good point.
[02:40:41.375 --> 02:40:45.596]  So we have to answer your earlier question about when this is going to end.
[02:40:45.716 --> 02:40:54.619]  It might take something like Waco or Ruby Ridge, a really dramatic overreaching on the part of the federal government.
[02:40:55.479 --> 02:41:02.561]  It's going to take something like that so Republicans realize... A facilitating, catalyzing event.
[02:41:02.641 --> 02:41:03.101]  Exactly.
[02:41:03.121 --> 02:41:09.563]  It's going to take something for the Republicans in the heartland, in the states, to realize that the Republicans in Washington...
[02:41:10.410 --> 02:41:12.131]  It may not necessarily be true.
[02:41:12.171 --> 02:41:17.335]  Conservatives may not really have their best... Well, how is the $2.6 trillion budget when Bill Clinton's biggest was $1.8 trillion?
[02:41:17.595 --> 02:41:18.616]  How is that conservative?
[02:41:18.656 --> 02:41:21.177]  That doesn't even count the $600 billion supplemental.
[02:41:21.898 --> 02:41:31.624]  Back in the early 80s, when conservative actually meant something, you had some Republicans politicians literally crying when Reagan said, well, let's
[02:41:35.587 --> 02:41:39.149]  Well, they basically do things like raise taxes or raise spending quite as much.
[02:42:02.706 --> 02:42:03.887]  It blows my mind.
[02:42:03.907 --> 02:42:10.112]  I mean, definitely from the feedback I know you've been getting, most people aren't for this national ID card.
[02:42:12.154 --> 02:42:27.906]  Yeah, I've seen in terms of responses from my readers, I've had about 200 of them so far, and I think about 5 or 10% have been either neutral or in favor, and the rest have been very vocally opposed to it.
[02:42:29.063 --> 02:42:30.624]  And it's the same on every big issue.
[02:42:30.644 --> 02:42:31.724]  The people don't want this.
[02:42:31.764 --> 02:42:35.905]  They know it's bad, but the government just says, oh, no, you do need this, and you're going to get it.
[02:42:36.505 --> 02:42:37.586]  I thought we're the people.
[02:42:37.646 --> 02:42:39.886]  I thought the government does what we want, Declan McCullough.
[02:42:40.086 --> 02:42:44.248]  Well, that might have been true a few hundred years ago, but come on, get with the picture.
[02:42:44.288 --> 02:42:53.950]  I mean, ever since FDR and the New Deal and the expansion of the federal income tax and the creation of the Federal Reserve and then the regulatory apparatus, it's sort of the other way around now.
[02:42:53.990 --> 02:42:55.511]  You really have to get with the times.
[02:42:56.758 --> 02:42:57.479]  I guess I do.
[02:42:57.559 --> 02:43:01.581]  Well, thanks for coming on and giving us all this key info.
[02:43:02.181 --> 02:43:04.543]  We can check out all your great stories.
[02:43:05.083 --> 02:43:07.805]  Again, give us both the important websites.
[02:43:07.865 --> 02:43:08.866]  Sure.
[02:43:08.946 --> 02:43:12.708]  Politechbot, P-O-L-I-T-E-C-H-B-O-T dot com.
[02:43:12.748 --> 02:43:18.511]  It's my personal site, and I write for news, N-E-W-S dot com for my day job.
[02:43:18.551 --> 02:43:19.732]  Last point I want to bring up to you.
[02:43:19.752 --> 02:43:20.833]  You're an influential writer.
[02:43:20.853 --> 02:43:25.116]  You're one of the few good people we know that isn't on the payroll out there of the Bush or the Democrats.
[02:43:27.189 --> 02:43:30.530]  Can we expect to get an article from you about the trillions missing from the Pentagon?
[02:43:31.051 --> 02:43:32.751]  This is now a three-year-old story.
[02:43:33.131 --> 02:43:34.952]  Cynthia McKinney brought it up a few months ago.
[02:43:34.992 --> 02:43:36.693]  They just said, we're not going to answer your questions.
[02:43:37.633 --> 02:43:40.294]  I think you can write an article for us about that.
[02:43:40.334 --> 02:43:41.774]  I mean, that is a technology story.
[02:43:42.054 --> 02:43:49.697]  Yeah, I tend to focus a little bit more on sort of privacy and surveillance and Internet technology, but I'll give it a shot.
[02:43:50.661 --> 02:43:54.063]  Well, they just say their computers don't work, but you're not allowed to investigate.
[02:43:56.605 --> 02:43:57.345]  I'll do my best.
[02:43:58.226 --> 02:44:02.488]  Well, that'd be awesome, because this is a story that needs to get legs, and most people aren't even aware of it.
[02:44:02.808 --> 02:44:03.168]  Quite right.
[02:44:03.709 --> 02:44:04.089]  All right.
[02:44:04.129 --> 02:44:06.210]  Well, Declan McCullough, thanks for coming on, and Godspeed.
[02:44:06.630 --> 02:44:07.111]  My pleasure.
[02:44:07.131 --> 02:44:07.711]  Thank you very much.
[02:44:07.811 --> 02:44:08.491]  We'll see you, buddy.
[02:44:09.232 --> 02:44:10.593]  I want to go to Sean, Mike, and Dave.
[02:44:10.613 --> 02:44:11.974]  That's all I have time to cover.
[02:44:12.014 --> 02:44:16.836]  But right now, here's the CBS News piece, and I've heard about this happening other places.
[02:44:17.497 --> 02:44:19.518]  Not quite as bad as this, but threatening them.
[02:44:20.094 --> 02:44:20.974]  You better show up.
[02:44:21.014 --> 02:44:24.816]  But here's CBS News with what they're doing in Houston, Texas.
[02:44:24.836 --> 02:44:25.616]  Here it is, folks.
[02:44:27.577 --> 02:44:33.839]  Going Army and making history appealed to 20-year-old Chris Monarch, and he called this Houston recruiting office.
[02:44:34.159 --> 02:44:35.139]  I recognize the name.
[02:44:35.159 --> 02:44:36.840]  His name was Kelt.
[02:44:37.200 --> 02:44:39.221]  Sergeant Thomas Kelt was the recruiter.
[02:44:39.901 --> 02:44:44.783]  But a new baby changed Monarch's plan to enlist, and he canceled his meeting with the recruiter.
[02:44:44.803 --> 02:44:46.463]  He said, I'm a volunteer firefighter.
[02:44:46.483 --> 02:44:48.764]  I'm eventually going to try to go career with it, and
[02:44:49.304 --> 02:44:51.806]  I'm just not interested anymore, and I hung up the phone.
[02:44:52.087 --> 02:44:58.172]  But the recruiter wouldn't take no for an answer, with a phone message threatening Monarch with arrest if he didn't show.
[02:44:58.593 --> 02:45:04.378]  By federal law, you got an appointment with me at 2 o'clock this afternoon at Greenpoint Mall, okay?
[02:45:04.598 --> 02:45:07.200]  Fail to appear, and we'll have a warrant, okay?
[02:45:07.481 --> 02:45:08.181]  So give me a call back.
[02:45:08.662 --> 02:45:10.724]  In fear, Monarch called the recruiter back.
[02:45:10.984 --> 02:45:13.746]  He said, oh, Chris, don't worry about that, man.
[02:45:13.766 --> 02:45:15.488]  That's just a marketing technique that I use.
[02:45:16.312 --> 02:45:21.498]  Reporter Mark Greenblatt of KHOU-TV questioned recruiter Sergeant Thomas Kelt.
[02:45:21.558 --> 02:45:27.946]  I'd just like to know why you have called up young men threatening to arrest them if they don't come and talk to you.
[02:45:29.628 --> 02:45:30.189]  No comment.
[02:45:30.489 --> 02:45:34.394]  You told the young man that this is a standard marketing technique that you use.
[02:45:35.054 --> 02:45:35.395]  Is that true?
[02:45:36.576 --> 02:45:37.076]  No comment.
[02:45:37.336 --> 02:45:39.358]  The case is under an Army investigation.
[02:45:39.638 --> 02:45:45.861]  It's really an insult to other recruiters who are handling themselves and conducting themselves the proper way.
[02:45:46.161 --> 02:45:52.545]  In Colorado, 19-year-old Michael Flaherty's recruiter gave him a laxative to lose weight to pass a physical.
[02:45:52.785 --> 02:45:54.365]  They even told me not to tell my parents about it.
[02:45:54.546 --> 02:45:58.848]  This form certifies Flaherty physically fit, complete with scores.
[02:45:58.868 --> 02:46:00.609]  I've never completed none of those tasks.
[02:46:01.369 --> 02:46:03.211]  And my recruiter faked the documents.
[02:46:03.411 --> 02:46:13.919]  From fake diplomas from phony schools, detox kits to beat drug tests, Denver CBS station KCNC uncovered a number of recruiter fraud cases.
[02:46:14.379 --> 02:46:15.360]  It's very stressful.
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:23.846]  Former recruiter Jeffrey Bacon says he's been busted from sergeant to specialist for not meeting his quota of 24 soldiers a year.
[02:46:23.866 --> 02:46:24.827]  I'm losing my job.
[02:46:25.367 --> 02:46:27.229]  I'm in financial debt.
[02:46:29.548 --> 02:46:33.650]  This year alone, the Army needs over 100,000 new soldiers worldwide.
[02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:40.853]  But with the war raging on in Iraq and volunteers harder and harder to find, recruiters face their toughest sell ever.
[02:46:41.294 --> 02:46:41.494]  Bob?
[02:46:42.454 --> 02:46:47.757]  Bob, I have heard of stand-downs after, say, a helicopter crash or something like that.
[02:46:47.857 --> 02:46:54.780]  I've never heard of the military ordering a stand-down, just a halt in the operations over recruiting.
[02:46:54.880 --> 02:46:56.401]  Have you ever heard of anything like this?
[02:46:58.473 --> 02:47:06.536]  No, a stand-down usually happens when there are accidents, crashes that need to be investigated, not when the roof falls in on the recruiting center.
[02:47:08.337 --> 02:47:13.278]  In this case, if it's not unprecedented, it is very, very, very unusual.
[02:47:14.499 --> 02:47:16.079]  And folks, that's just because they got caught.
[02:47:16.119 --> 02:47:17.180]  This is what they're doing.
[02:47:18.460 --> 02:47:25.143]  And they go into the inner cities with these big orange Humvees playing gangster rap, top killer music.
[02:47:25.163 --> 02:47:26.123]  I mean, I've got video of this.
[02:47:26.949 --> 02:47:29.970]  And they tell them, you're going to be a gangster, you're going to be a star, sign, sign.
[02:47:30.490 --> 02:47:32.010]  And they can't even get those kids anymore.
[02:47:32.130 --> 02:47:38.751]  Because people know about depleted uranium, they know about the shots that are being given, they know about how you sign up for three years, you stay ten.
[02:47:38.891 --> 02:47:40.172]  I mean, they don't let you out now.
[02:47:41.172 --> 02:47:42.552]  And so what are the globalists going to do?
[02:47:42.572 --> 02:47:45.033]  Well, they're going to blow something up, and they're going to give us a national draft.
[02:47:45.933 --> 02:47:47.713]  And that's what they've got to do.
[02:47:47.773 --> 02:47:49.874]  They want to invade Syria, they want to invade Iran.
[02:47:50.134 --> 02:47:51.674]  They can't even keep control of Iraq.
[02:47:52.392 --> 02:47:57.635]  And the plan all along was to let Iraq fall into racial fighting, religious, ethnic fighting.
[02:47:58.335 --> 02:48:00.796]  We have the documents on this.
[02:48:01.236 --> 02:48:04.078]  They want that entire region in a quagmire.
[02:48:04.098 --> 02:48:06.419]  They don't want a good, strong government in Baghdad.
[02:48:07.500 --> 02:48:12.402]  So they're getting what they want at a certain level, but at another level, they can't even sustain that and keep control of it.
[02:48:13.142 --> 02:48:18.445]  And so, no matter how many troops they pull out of North Korea or out of Germany, they just don't have it.
[02:48:18.945 --> 02:48:20.266]  But the question is, what are they going to do?
[02:48:22.632 --> 02:48:26.937]  And they're very arrogant, they're very confident right now, and that's why I think they're going to carry out a terror attack.
[02:48:28.078 --> 02:48:34.164]  And whenever David Ray Griffin got asked about this on C-SPAN, he said, yeah, that's probably going to happen.
[02:48:35.305 --> 02:48:36.847]  I mean, that's just their past M.O.
[02:48:37.467 --> 02:48:40.030]  Maybe if we expose this behind the terrorism, they won't do it.
[02:48:40.770 --> 02:48:42.192]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:48:46.019 --> 02:48:52.844]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.164 --> 02:48:54.525]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.726 --> 02:48:56.947]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.087 --> 02:48:59.189]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.449 --> 02:49:04.393]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.733 --> 02:49:08.776]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.996 --> 02:49:09.836]  We're good to go.
[02:49:10.016 --> 02:49:10.216]  I think?
[02:49:32.725 --> 02:49:33.587]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:33.888 --> 02:49:39.820]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:40.802]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:49:45.180 --> 02:49:52.708]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:52.988 --> 02:50:03.899]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:04.079 --> 02:50:04.559]  We're good to go.
[02:50:04.659 --> 02:50:04.819]  I think?
[02:50:20.649 --> 02:50:21.149]  That's right.
[02:50:21.329 --> 02:50:28.431]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.731 --> 02:50:37.474]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:37.514 --> 02:50:37.974]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[02:51:51.842 --> 02:51:55.765]  This grenade that turned out to be a fake, I mean, that's just so obvious.
[02:51:55.925 --> 02:51:57.307]  Oh, our dirt leader's under threat.
[02:51:57.327 --> 02:51:58.708]  We've got to take all your rights away.
[02:51:59.480 --> 02:52:00.600]  That was so obvious.
[02:52:01.160 --> 02:52:03.201]  They've passed the Super National ID card.
[02:52:03.221 --> 02:52:12.123]  And I'm sure they'll continue on expanding as our journey towards total enslavement just continues.
[02:52:12.163 --> 02:52:18.804]  Before I take a couple final calls here, my new film, Martial Law 9-11, Rise of the Police State, is out.
[02:52:20.404 --> 02:52:22.365]  And I really do hope that you'll all get it.
[02:52:22.865 --> 02:52:25.505]  Three hours long DVD, over two and a half hours long VHS.
[02:52:25.565 --> 02:52:26.846]  It's a miniseries.
[02:52:27.346 --> 02:52:29.126]  Covers the police state like no other film.
[02:52:29.890 --> 02:52:46.012]  It gets into 9-11 for a full hour of film in and of itself, and a full hour on who the globalists are, the occult connection to Skull and Bones, Bohemian Grove, the Nazi connection with the Bushes, and Schwarzenegger, and the latest Big Brother activities in the last ten minutes of the film.
[02:52:47.037 --> 02:52:48.857]  You need to get this documentary.
[02:52:48.877 --> 02:52:50.138]  Toll-free number to order it.

[02:53:37.010 --> 02:53:37.410]  Go ahead.
[02:53:37.950 --> 02:53:39.751]  Alex, Alex, good to talk to you, brother.
[02:53:40.091 --> 02:53:41.912]  PrisonPlanet.tv subscriber.
[02:53:41.952 --> 02:53:43.052]  Got all your videos.
[02:53:43.072 --> 02:53:43.613]  Thanks for the support.
[02:53:43.653 --> 02:53:44.513]  Got all your t-shirts.
[02:53:45.251 --> 02:53:58.279]  I gotta tell you, just got my new Florida driver's license slash ID card with the 2D barcode, magnetic strip, digitized portrait signature, and as they quote on their webpage, various other security features.
[02:53:59.040 --> 02:54:00.961]  Anyway, I gotta tell you what happened to me Sunday.
[02:54:01.401 --> 02:54:06.224]  I'm at the local grocer with the wife and the two kids, got my Tyranny Response t-shirt on.
[02:54:06.784 --> 02:54:09.106]  Gentleman comes up behind me and goes, hey, cute t-shirt.
[02:54:09.724 --> 02:54:10.625]  Where can I get one of those?
[02:54:10.725 --> 02:54:11.967]  I said InfoWars.com.
[02:54:12.187 --> 02:54:13.028]  He says, oh yeah.
[02:54:13.288 --> 02:54:15.210]  And he whips out his FEMA badge.
[02:54:15.491 --> 02:54:16.051]  Believe that one.
[02:54:16.612 --> 02:54:20.296]  He says, I've got to get one of those shirts, hang my FEMA badge on it, and walks away.
[02:54:21.838 --> 02:54:22.358]  Interesting.
[02:54:22.518 --> 02:54:25.041]  You think that was intimidation or you think he was a fan?
[02:54:25.362 --> 02:54:29.226]  No, I think it was probably a little intimidation, like he wanted to reverse the meaning of the T-shirt.
[02:54:31.374 --> 02:54:36.336]  Well, you see, they're guilty, and that's the type of gangster-like activity that thugs like that have.
[02:54:36.376 --> 02:54:37.597]  But let me tell you something.
[02:54:37.877 --> 02:54:39.558]  Their own troops aren't doing it anymore.
[02:54:39.618 --> 02:54:42.119]  Their own police refuse to take the forced inoculations.
[02:54:42.519 --> 02:54:47.062]  Two years ago, as part of the Model State's Old Emergency Powers Act, their system's falling apart.
[02:54:47.642 --> 02:54:48.662]  What did you say to him?
[02:54:48.722 --> 02:54:52.524]  I mean, it was in Florida that it came out where they're hiring all the hardcore criminals.
[02:54:53.225 --> 02:54:54.925]  That guy might have been a hardcore criminal.
[02:54:54.965 --> 02:54:55.806]  Might have been a murderer.
[02:54:56.326 --> 02:54:56.846]  Could have been.
[02:54:56.986 --> 02:54:58.147]  Well, he was older.
[02:54:58.935 --> 02:54:59.696]  Uh, older gentleman.
[02:54:59.716 --> 02:55:01.338]  So, I mean, what did you say to him after he did it?
[02:55:02.139 --> 02:55:03.340]  I said, well, go there, order one.
[02:55:03.380 --> 02:55:04.321]  I'd like to see you wear it.
[02:55:04.862 --> 02:55:05.462]  Spread the word.
[02:55:06.003 --> 02:55:08.105]  And when you didn't act scared, did he scuttle off?
[02:55:08.606 --> 02:55:10.147]  Yeah, he just kind of sulked away.
[02:55:10.608 --> 02:55:11.409]  He was by himself.
[02:55:11.769 --> 02:55:14.612]  So he walked off like a little un-American spider.
[02:55:14.832 --> 02:55:15.473]  Exactly.
[02:55:15.673 --> 02:55:18.256]  But I've never seen anybody whip out a FEMA badge on me before.
[02:55:19.085 --> 02:55:19.605]  Oh, don't worry.
[02:55:19.625 --> 02:55:20.546]  They're all over the place.
[02:55:21.547 --> 02:55:25.789]  But when it comes to... When push comes to shove, we'll find out who the real men are.
[02:55:26.109 --> 02:55:26.789]  We have love.
[02:55:26.829 --> 02:55:27.450]  They have hate.
[02:55:27.470 --> 02:55:28.050]  We're going to win.
[02:55:28.410 --> 02:55:29.871]  Sean, you keep it up, my friend.
[02:55:30.071 --> 02:55:30.371]  I will.
[02:55:30.411 --> 02:55:30.972]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:55:31.092 --> 02:55:32.813]  Vaya con Dios.
[02:55:32.893 --> 02:55:33.793]  Michael in Ohio.
[02:55:33.833 --> 02:55:34.434]  Go ahead, Michael.
[02:55:36.215 --> 02:55:36.835]  Quickly, Michael.
[02:55:37.435 --> 02:55:37.876]  Hey, Alex.
[02:55:37.916 --> 02:55:38.496]  How are you doing?
[02:55:38.556 --> 02:55:38.796]  Good.
[02:55:39.817 --> 02:55:42.859]  Hey, I was calling about a while back.
[02:55:42.899 --> 02:55:45.040]  You had a caller call in and was talking about...
[02:55:45.931 --> 02:55:46.492]  Yeah, there is.
[02:55:46.532 --> 02:55:47.613]  There is symbolism in it.
[02:55:47.653 --> 02:55:47.913]  Yeah.
[02:55:47.933 --> 02:55:48.113]  Yeah.
[02:56:13.777 --> 02:56:25.528]  Yeah, I was wondering if you could get somebody on your show that would talk more about, you know, the globalist hand in music and mind control that's going on in the media and things like that.
[02:56:25.888 --> 02:56:27.069]  All right, I'll try to do it.
[02:56:27.129 --> 02:56:28.050]  Sorry to Dave and others.
[02:56:28.471 --> 02:56:29.151]  We're out of time.
[02:56:29.171 --> 02:56:30.332]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:30.352 --> 02:56:31.413]  Back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:31.774 --> 02:56:33.135]  Get out there and take on the New World Order.
[02:56:33.175 --> 02:56:34.116]  God bless you all!
