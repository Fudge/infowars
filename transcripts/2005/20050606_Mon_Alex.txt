[00:00:05.541 --> 00:00:06.161]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.842 --> 00:00:07.863]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.623 --> 00:00:09.724]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.364 --> 00:00:11.205]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:12.846]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.526 --> 00:00:17.249]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.709 --> 00:00:21.752]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:28.942 --> 00:00:31.783]  All right, my friends, now into hour number two.
[00:00:31.863 --> 00:00:41.986]  We've got Sully Castillo, top DEA agent in Latin America, highly decorated Army sniper in Vietnam, witness CIA drug dealing, officially sanctioned by the White House.
[00:00:42.706 --> 00:00:44.547]  And we'll be talking about how these Lazada...
[00:00:46.226 --> 00:00:46.986]  We're good to go.
[00:00:47.046 --> 00:00:47.947]  We're good to go.
[00:01:09.757 --> 00:01:13.539]  And the website is CharlesGoyette.com, G-O-Y-E-T-T-E.
[00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:18.120]  Talk show host there with a lot of great listeners in Arizona.
[00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.243]  He's a libertarian and fired for not basically propagandizing for the Iraq War by Clear Channel.
[00:01:24.963 --> 00:01:27.184]  Charles, I've got some news I want to throw out at you.
[00:01:28.104 --> 00:01:30.605]  Can I tell just one quick media echo chamber story?
[00:01:32.886 --> 00:01:41.692]  Sure, you're there at the 2000 Endless Vote Counting in Florida, and you're at this bar every night, sitting around with all the big media people, but they get their notepads out at 8 o'clock.
[00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:45.935]  Oh yeah, and so they all get their leads for their next day's story off what's on Larry King's show.
[00:01:46.275 --> 00:01:52.019]  And that's the extent of their reporting, but at the same time we're sitting in that restaurant, there's a story unfolding under all of their noses.
[00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:54.441]  We're sitting in this restaurant back in the kitchen.
[00:01:54.781 --> 00:02:01.086]  The kitchen help, the day staff, the bus boys, the cooks, the waitresses, the bartenders.
[00:02:01.346 --> 00:02:04.409]  They're back in that kitchen and they're making thousands of sandwiches, Alex.
[00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.231]  And they're bag after bag after bag of sandwiches.
[00:02:07.251 --> 00:02:10.634]  And they're popping candy in there and a sandwich and napkins and potato chips.
[00:02:10.694 --> 00:02:12.655]  Thousands of these bags of candy.
[00:02:12.876 --> 00:02:14.096]  Now think about this.
[00:02:14.137 --> 00:02:15.958]  They're all these great investigative reporters.
[00:02:16.158 --> 00:02:16.458]  Right?
[00:02:16.598 --> 00:02:19.620]  From cable TV and the big news journalists.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.080]  But they're not.
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.101]  They're really just parrots.
[00:02:21.181 --> 00:02:23.162]  They're just taking the Larry King Show.
[00:02:23.262 --> 00:02:26.823]  So I asked the cocktail waitress, what are they making all those sandwiches back to back for?
[00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:27.724]  She says, I don't know.
[00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:30.225]  But those guys across the street ordered them.
[00:02:30.265 --> 00:02:31.606]  So I go across the street.
[00:02:32.226 --> 00:02:35.129]  It is the Florida office of the AFL-CIO.
[00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.311]  So I go over there and I look in the window.
[00:02:37.351 --> 00:02:38.211]  Yeah, they're working late.
[00:02:38.231 --> 00:02:39.172]  They're burning the midnight oil.
[00:02:39.192 --> 00:02:45.658]  So I go back and I realize that these guys at the Florida office of the AFL-CIO are ordering these thousands of sandwiches.
[00:02:45.738 --> 00:02:50.322]  The next day, there's supposed to be this spontaneous demonstration...
[00:02:51.122 --> 00:02:57.746]  Out in the courthouse square outside one of the courthouses in Tallahassee, the capital of Florida.
[00:02:57.806 --> 00:02:59.127]  And it was really a rent-a-mob.
[00:02:59.527 --> 00:03:00.368]  It was a rent-a-mob.
[00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:01.889]  They hired Jesse Jackson.
[00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.051]  They paid him to come down there and be the keynote speaker to draw a crowd.
[00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:12.175]  And they've got thousands of people, and they're all filing in, and they're handing them their little sandwiches that have been made and paid for the night before.
[00:03:12.475 --> 00:03:18.259]  So I go in there, and I walk in the line, and I take my little sandwich, and they hand me a pre-printed placard to carry about...
[00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.419]  About the election.
[00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:33.083]  I go in there and I'm milling around and I start asking all these people that are protesting there in this so-called spontaneous protest but got the free sandwiches that were ordered the night before from the AFL-CIO office in Tallahassee that was burning the midnight oil.
[00:03:33.423 --> 00:03:34.524]  I said, what are you doing here?
[00:03:34.984 --> 00:03:39.545]  First lady says, black lady says to me, well, I work at this textile plant in North Carolina.
[00:03:39.585 --> 00:03:40.785]  They bust us down here today.
[00:03:40.825 --> 00:03:42.886]  It's a mandatory union event.
[00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:48.092]  I went, oh, well... And that's a major story of political manipulation.
[00:03:48.212 --> 00:03:55.136]  Simultaneously, the Republicans are doing similar things, but the media has been trying to never cover anything substantive.
[00:03:55.176 --> 00:03:56.937]  So I start asking other people.
[00:03:56.957 --> 00:04:06.143]  There are people there from Alabama, people from Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, from every state, and it's supposed to be this spontaneous demonstration of these people from Florida, but it was all orchestrated.
[00:04:06.483 --> 00:04:08.384]  It was all paid for and orchestrated.
[00:04:08.724 --> 00:04:11.586]  And so I look the next day for how this story is reported.
[00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:13.328]  That night it goes on NBC News.
[00:04:13.668 --> 00:04:17.251]  They talk about this spontaneous outpouring of people that just came together.
[00:04:17.631 --> 00:04:20.153]  And the next day I get the story out of USA Today.
[00:04:20.334 --> 00:04:21.094]  The same thing.
[00:04:21.555 --> 00:04:25.217]  Not a word about the fact that this is all orchestrated for public consumption.
[00:04:25.518 --> 00:04:26.979]  This stuff goes on all the time.
[00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:28.740]  One more.
[00:04:29.041 --> 00:04:30.662]  This is my favorite one, Alex.
[00:04:30.722 --> 00:04:32.403]  This is a... I'll hold it.
[00:04:32.583 --> 00:04:33.224]  I'll hold it.
[00:04:33.244 --> 00:04:36.547]  Yeah, I want to hear that story and then I want to talk about other propaganda.
[00:04:36.747 --> 00:04:38.028]  The Pat Tillman cover-up.
[00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.449]  Really unraveling for them.
[00:04:40.489 --> 00:04:40.910]  Oh, yeah.
[00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.431]  How that ties into private.
[00:04:42.551 --> 00:04:42.831]  Oh, yeah.
[00:04:43.171 --> 00:04:43.912]  Jessica Lynch.
[00:04:44.172 --> 00:04:44.472]  Oh, yeah.
[00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:46.173]  And I want to get into Patriot Act 2.5.
[00:04:46.293 --> 00:04:47.414]  Oh, yeah.
[00:04:47.494 --> 00:04:49.756]  Yeah, the gun owners will love it.
[00:04:50.156 --> 00:04:51.257]  Register my guns, Bush.
[00:04:51.297 --> 00:04:52.157]  It's so conservative.
[00:04:52.718 --> 00:04:54.439]  It's all coming up after this quick break.
[00:04:54.519 --> 00:04:55.619]  And your calls, I promise.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.180]  Straight away on the other side.
[00:04:57.201 --> 00:04:57.261]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:02.584]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:02.764 --> 00:05:05.845]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:05.985 --> 00:05:09.866]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:09.906 --> 00:05:14.147]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:05:14.507 --> 00:05:18.268]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.408 --> 00:05:20.169]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.472]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:28.632 --> 00:05:31.674]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:05:31.854 --> 00:05:34.715]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[00:05:35.195 --> 00:05:41.318]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:41.858 --> 00:05:43.959]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:11.374]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:06:11.535 --> 00:06:19.138]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:22.500]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:23.060]  We're good to go.
[00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:47.295]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:51.777]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:51.797 --> 00:06:52.798]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:07:00.803 --> 00:07:03.144]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[00:07:03.404 --> 00:07:07.246]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[00:07:07.566 --> 00:07:08.387]  Read the labels.
[00:07:08.807 --> 00:07:12.949]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:17.351]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[00:07:17.731 --> 00:07:22.593]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[00:07:22.973 --> 00:07:26.575]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[00:07:26.755 --> 00:07:32.098]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[00:07:32.378 --> 00:07:35.099]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:36.280]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:42.343]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:07:50.188 --> 00:07:50.709]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.264 --> 00:08:11.167]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.928 --> 00:08:12.808]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.489 --> 00:08:17.291]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.672 --> 00:08:21.735]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:23.843 --> 00:08:27.147]  Alright, 8 minutes, 25 seconds into the second hour.
[00:08:27.227 --> 00:08:28.789]  It is the first day of June 2005.
[00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:31.833]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:08:31.873 --> 00:08:33.936]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:33.976 --> 00:08:37.661]  We're about to go to the callers that have been holding patiently.
[00:08:38.502 --> 00:08:49.873]  We're talking to Charles Goyette, and it's charlesgoyette.com, a long-time talk show host, libertarian, there on Air America affiliate in good old Arizona.
[00:08:49.993 --> 00:08:54.157]  We've been talking about media propaganda, media manipulation, the establishment media.
[00:08:54.678 --> 00:08:57.601]  And Charles, I want to go to calls here in a second, but I wanted to hit two more stories.
[00:08:57.621 --> 00:09:02.165]  The story I wanted to cover was Pat Tillman, but first you were going to give us another story of media...
[00:09:03.366 --> 00:09:07.070]  Mainstream media ignoring big stories hitting right under their noses.
[00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.251]  This is a really good one.
[00:09:08.291 --> 00:09:11.415]  This tells the whole deal and it's my favorite and it's very short.
[00:09:11.815 --> 00:09:21.025]  Back during the lead up to the war one of the pretexts for the war of course was the weaponry that Saddam didn't actually have and they used as evidence the aluminum tubes
[00:09:21.505 --> 00:09:24.307]  Now, this was a classic story.
[00:09:24.527 --> 00:09:32.411]  The Cheney office, Dick Cheney's office, leaked the bogus story about the aluminum tubes to the New York Times.
[00:09:32.871 --> 00:09:35.192]  The New York Times runs the story on Sunday morning.
[00:09:35.552 --> 00:09:46.058]  Later that morning, Dick Cheney shows up on Meet the Press with Tim Russert, and Cheney's making the case for the war, and he goes, but there are aluminum tubes, and they're going to kill us all.
[00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:49.640]  And he says, listen to this, he says, but don't take my word for it.
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:51.521]  It's in the New York Times.
[00:09:52.381 --> 00:09:54.902]  The same story that they had just leaked to them.
[00:09:54.982 --> 00:09:56.582]  When he's the source.
[00:09:56.862 --> 00:10:02.944]  Which our own Department of Energy at the same time was saying, nonsense, inappropriate, can't be used for that, not for those purposes.
[00:10:03.465 --> 00:10:05.385]  So, I mean, this is the way that they play the game.
[00:10:05.405 --> 00:10:10.587]  They leak the story, then they go on the air, and they cite the story that they leaked as a reference.
[00:10:10.607 --> 00:10:11.787]  Well, it's a lot worse than that.
[00:10:11.827 --> 00:10:14.788]  I mean, they create fake Niger uranium documents.
[00:10:14.808 --> 00:10:19.530]  They use 12-year-old graduate student documents as the latest MI6 information.
[00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:26.454]  Doesn't it seem peculiar that there is a lot of counterfeiting going on, Alex, and nobody ever gets to the bottom of it?
[00:10:26.494 --> 00:10:29.255]  You saw the Galloway testimony to the Senate committee the other day.
[00:10:29.315 --> 00:10:30.676]  We had Galloway on yesterday.
[00:10:30.756 --> 00:10:32.077]  Well, I'll tell you something.
[00:10:32.337 --> 00:10:37.880]  He's got court demonstrated that there were forged documents.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:38.601]  Well, he just won a...
[00:10:39.699 --> 00:10:39.919]  Yeah.
[00:10:39.959 --> 00:10:41.081]  $3 million judgment.
[00:10:41.621 --> 00:10:45.485]  Now, I'd like to know, who's forging all these documents?
[00:10:45.565 --> 00:10:51.852]  Don't you think if we're going to have a succession of official investigations... Well, the Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence.
[00:10:52.073 --> 00:10:53.254]  Well, yeah.
[00:10:53.494 --> 00:10:56.978]  It's actually a little thicker than that in my view, but that's a subject for discussion.
[00:10:57.018 --> 00:11:00.221]  Well, that's directly who we found linked to the Baghdad fake documents.
[00:11:00.462 --> 00:11:00.562]  Yep.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.161]  Yeah, I was talking about the...
[00:11:25.774 --> 00:11:27.536]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:11:27.636 --> 00:11:28.697]  Pat Tillman was fighting Al-Qaeda.
[00:11:48.715 --> 00:11:49.015]  I think so.
[00:12:15.681 --> 00:12:27.085]  They knew the truth, and they wouldn't even tell the bereaved family until after they had their recruiting events, they had the public ceremony, they had the flyover by the F-16s.
[00:12:27.665 --> 00:12:37.909]  You may remember that all that public hype about him and the flyovers and the events in the stadiums and so on were just at the time that the Abu Ghraib story was breaking.
[00:12:38.189 --> 00:12:39.791]  All of the chickens are coming home to Roosh now.
[00:13:00.245 --> 00:13:21.612]  Well, in that case, but I mean, you run into these Kool-Aid drinkers, and you know it, Alex, that story by story by story you refute the things that we have been told, you uncover the lies, you find out the misrepresentations all the way from the mushroom clouds to the drones to Pat Tillman, and still they continue to believe.
[00:13:22.967 --> 00:13:24.348]  It's just amazing.
[00:13:24.388 --> 00:13:25.469]  It blows my mind.
[00:13:25.569 --> 00:13:26.670]  But I don't know.
[00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:34.615]  I think less and less people are buying into it because real conservatives who are good people are finding out that Bush is anything but a conservative.
[00:13:34.635 --> 00:13:36.316]  And I think that's the chink in the armor.
[00:13:36.776 --> 00:13:44.621]  As long as Bush can set himself up against the evil Democrats, which I'll say are pretty darn bad, folks, as long as he can do that, then, well, at least he's the lesser of two evils.
[00:13:44.962 --> 00:13:48.304]  But when you look at the actual policies, he's like Bill Clinton on steroids.
[00:13:48.784 --> 00:13:52.145]  Yeah, he's simply one of the most reckless.
[00:13:52.185 --> 00:13:57.086]  Look, the primary tenet of conservatism is judicious action.
[00:13:57.406 --> 00:13:59.687]  So you don't go into a war if a war is avoidable.
[00:13:59.727 --> 00:14:02.308]  A wise man could avoid a war, he would avoid a war.
[00:14:02.568 --> 00:14:07.689]  There is nothing judicious, there is nothing moderate about his behavior.
[00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:12.871]  It is as reckless and financially foolish as anything we've seen in this country.
[00:14:12.931 --> 00:14:14.451]  And the evidence is all over it every hand.
[00:14:17.452 --> 00:14:18.892]  What's the Downing Street document now?
[00:14:19.112 --> 00:14:22.914]  Well, in fact, you've got a companion piece to the Downing Street document.
[00:14:22.954 --> 00:14:33.917]  Now you've got the British story that's broken about they've let the cat out of the bag that we intentionally doubled or actually quadrupled our rate of bombing to force Saddam to do something.
[00:14:33.937 --> 00:14:35.077]  And that was the times of London.
[00:14:35.237 --> 00:14:37.138]  Yep, to play into our hands.
[00:14:37.158 --> 00:14:38.478]  To get him to fire back.
[00:14:38.558 --> 00:14:41.399]  To get him to fire back so that we could have the war that we wanted to have.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.021]  We're bombing the cities for no reason to get him to attack us.
[00:14:45.341 --> 00:14:45.602]  Look!
[00:14:45.922 --> 00:14:47.683]  Somebody fired an aircraft at us!
[00:14:48.083 --> 00:14:51.745]  Well, you have to understand that there are people that are under all of those bombs.
[00:14:51.805 --> 00:14:57.709]  I mean, there's a human toll on this, and Bush is absolutely indifferent to that as long as he can prevail.
[00:14:57.729 --> 00:14:59.210]  Well, he says he doesn't even read the newspaper.
[00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:01.151]  We've got to be clear that Bush is a total puppet.
[00:15:01.371 --> 00:15:05.554]  Let's talk to Joe in Wisconsin, and then Robert in Colorado and others.
[00:15:05.594 --> 00:15:06.114]  Go ahead, Joe.
[00:15:06.784 --> 00:15:07.705]  Hello, Charles, Alex.
[00:15:08.085 --> 00:15:19.131]  I have a unique opportunity here in southeast Wisconsin because WISN Radio, they have a talk host slot open, and I'm going to be applying for that this Saturday, June 4th.
[00:15:19.711 --> 00:15:24.974]  It is a clear channel station, so if either of you could give me any helpful hints or whatever.
[00:15:24.994 --> 00:15:26.495]  Yeah, I got a hint for you.
[00:15:26.916 --> 00:15:27.656]  Okay.
[00:15:27.876 --> 00:15:29.197]  Don't use me as a reference.
[00:15:30.204 --> 00:15:30.705]  Okay.
[00:15:30.905 --> 00:15:35.708]  Just say you love the war, love world government, and want to turn all your guns in because you're conservative.
[00:15:35.888 --> 00:15:42.273]  Well, I think people are getting really tired of that, and that's one thing that I want to give back because we've had a lot of problems.
[00:15:42.553 --> 00:15:45.695]  No, I think, I mean, they'll certainly like to be able to say they've got a counterbalance.
[00:15:45.975 --> 00:15:51.038]  They tend to do that, put somebody on late night or put somebody on the weekend and then say, oh, look, we've got a counterbalance.
[00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:54.781]  So, yeah, I mean, pitch them the truth and say, look, I'll be a counterbalance.
[00:15:54.801 --> 00:15:57.483]  You can claim objectivity and fairness.
[00:15:57.803 --> 00:15:58.944]  That might be a good pitch for you.
[00:15:58.964 --> 00:15:59.224]  Okay.
[00:15:59.604 --> 00:16:08.355]  Well, what they're going to do is they're going to have a lottery system, and then we're going to have a live audience there.
[00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:15.183]  But if anybody listening from Wisconsin wishes to call in or email the stations, WISN and...
[00:16:16.855 --> 00:16:20.119]  Say, well, we wish to have this kind of programming.
[00:16:20.179 --> 00:16:21.621]  Okay, Joe, thanks for the call.
[00:16:21.641 --> 00:16:26.447]  Yeah, Joe, and take a tip from Alex and speak with enthusiasm if you want to be successful.
[00:16:26.487 --> 00:16:27.207]  Yeah, thanks, Joe.
[00:16:27.227 --> 00:16:28.729]  Let's talk to Robert in Colorado.
[00:16:28.990 --> 00:16:29.791]  Robert, go ahead.
[00:16:30.011 --> 00:16:31.232]  Good morning, gentlemen.
[00:16:31.252 --> 00:16:31.993]  Thanks for taking my call.
[00:16:32.013 --> 00:16:32.634]  Appreciate that.
[00:16:33.815 --> 00:16:38.242]  Alex, going back a little bit in time, you may have already talked about this, but I didn't get a chance to hear your opinion.
[00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:44.551]  What do you think is really going on with all the base closings that the government has enacted recently, four or five weeks ago?
[00:16:45.192 --> 00:16:49.058]  Really, it's been a part of a long-term plan going from the World War II model to a more modern model.
[00:16:49.138 --> 00:16:50.298]  I feel much the same way.
[00:16:50.338 --> 00:16:51.079]  Look, they're overstretched.
[00:17:15.328 --> 00:17:15.989]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:16.589]  A fast, mobile force.
[00:17:16.609 --> 00:17:18.330]  I mean, that's their own Pentagon war plan statement.
[00:17:37.548 --> 00:17:42.751]  Well, I mean, they're spending more money than ever, you know.
[00:17:43.091 --> 00:17:44.972]  Charles talked about $600 billion budget.
[00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:54.098]  They're already getting that with, what, twice a year, $80 billion supplemental packages, and then all the black-off budgets, that's over $100 billion.
[00:17:54.418 --> 00:17:59.101]  This new budget is going to be $3.3 trillion all spent total.
[00:18:01.206 --> 00:18:03.627]  2.6 trillion, 3.2 to 3.3.
[00:18:04.988 --> 00:18:07.129]  We have a new term here on the Charles Goyette Show.
[00:18:07.149 --> 00:18:11.491]  I'm going to see if I can copyright it like Pat Riley did with 3-Pete.
[00:18:11.891 --> 00:18:13.531]  The new word is scroomed.
[00:18:14.032 --> 00:18:16.473]  It's a cross between screwed and doomed.
[00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:17.813]  We're scroomed.
[00:18:17.953 --> 00:18:18.653]  We're scroomed.
[00:18:18.714 --> 00:18:19.954]  All right, Robert.
[00:18:20.274 --> 00:18:20.534]  Thanks.
[00:18:20.834 --> 00:18:21.595]  Jim in Michigan.
[00:18:21.635 --> 00:18:22.215]  Go ahead, Jim.
[00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:24.967]  Not all is bad news.
[00:18:25.027 --> 00:18:28.189]  South Bend Lathes is making new lathes again in Indiana.
[00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:30.150]  Oh, wow, a factory!
[00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:39.557]  Yeah, and we got Carl Miller out of the nut house, and then we got him out of down there in Monroe County.
[00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:40.397]  Okay, that's an activist.
[00:18:40.417 --> 00:18:42.499]  Do you have any comments about the guest?
[00:18:43.659 --> 00:18:44.320]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:18:44.360 --> 00:18:45.340]  I didn't know.
[00:18:45.481 --> 00:18:47.182]  Go ahead.
[00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:49.243]  I'll tell you how you can end this whole thing.
[00:18:49.283 --> 00:18:50.644]  Do the consecration of Russia.
[00:18:50.684 --> 00:18:53.466]  This pope covered it up when he was Cardinal Ratzinger.
[00:18:54.651 --> 00:18:55.392]  Well, I'll say this.
[00:18:55.432 --> 00:19:02.601]  We have fallen away from God and lost our morals, and that's a big reason that this country's falling apart, but I don't know if the Pope can save us.
[00:19:03.041 --> 00:19:04.383]  Well, they have to do it.
[00:19:04.443 --> 00:19:06.425]  Our Lord said you're doomed unless it's done.
[00:19:06.465 --> 00:19:10.030]  They did a consecration of Portugal right after Fatima.
[00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:12.412]  And that country stayed out of World War II.
[00:19:12.612 --> 00:19:13.913]  It raged around them.
[00:19:14.013 --> 00:19:14.454]  Check it out.
[00:19:14.674 --> 00:19:15.555]  Jim, thanks for the call.
[00:19:15.595 --> 00:19:16.355]  I mean, I'll say this.
[00:19:16.876 --> 00:19:23.502]  If we ask God to heal this land and ask God to move us to be leaders, to stand up against evil, we can turn things around.
[00:19:23.722 --> 00:19:25.644]  You know, God helps those who help themselves.
[00:19:27.285 --> 00:19:36.792]  I mean, sure, pray, but also roll away from the rocks, as a famous individual said, or an old Bedouin saying, trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[00:19:37.532 --> 00:19:38.253]  Charles, stay with us.
[00:19:38.273 --> 00:19:43.096]  We're going to come back and talk to Fred and others that are patiently holding, Fred and Marilyn and others.
[00:19:43.697 --> 00:19:47.740]  And then we're going to have Sully Costello on, talk about government drug dealing.
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.222]  Yes, bringing you the products when your dumb kids use them.
[00:19:50.542 --> 00:19:55.005]  They put them in a private prison, working for 20 cents an hour, taking everybody else's jobs.
[00:19:55.896 --> 00:19:58.904]  We'll also talk about the Mexican drug gangs controlled by Lord Bush.
[00:20:01.887 --> 00:20:07.410]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[00:20:07.570 --> 00:20:08.630]  You wear deodorant, right?
[00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:09.611]  Well, let's hope you do.
[00:20:09.731 --> 00:20:12.572]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[00:20:12.752 --> 00:20:17.634]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[00:20:17.894 --> 00:20:18.975]  Check out this new product.
[00:20:19.115 --> 00:20:22.016]  It's called No-B-O and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[00:20:22.396 --> 00:20:26.098]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[00:20:26.258 --> 00:20:26.418]  Look.
[00:20:26.618 --> 00:20:28.920]  The creator of No Bio understands what you're going through.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.065]  She knows you want a safe deodorant that contains no aluminum, preservatives, chemicals, or petroleum-based products.
[00:20:34.105 --> 00:20:37.228]  She also knows that while you want it all natural, you want it very effective.
[00:20:37.348 --> 00:20:42.793]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[00:20:42.853 --> 00:20:43.614]  Try No Bio.
[00:20:43.734 --> 00:20:44.715]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[00:20:45.896 --> 00:20:48.820]  NoBO is so highly concentrated, a little goal's a long way.
[00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.844]  Give them a call at 888-881-NOBO.
[00:20:52.024 --> 00:20:54.488]  Check out their website at no-bo.com.
[00:20:54.668 --> 00:20:57.952]  Come on, it's time for you to enjoy the sweet smell of success with NoBO.
[00:20:58.133 --> 00:20:58.914]  That's no-bo.com.
[00:21:02.737 --> 00:21:03.779]  The war on terrorism.
[00:21:04.099 --> 00:21:06.903]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:07.163 --> 00:21:11.329]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:11.749 --> 00:21:12.570]  So what do you do?
[00:21:12.891 --> 00:21:17.457]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:17.937 --> 00:21:20.078]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:20.558 --> 00:21:35.265]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:35.305 --> 00:21:42.368]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:42.648 --> 00:21:43.850]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:22:01.109 --> 00:22:02.571]  To the farthest corners of the Earth.
[00:22:02.871 --> 00:22:07.476]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[00:22:07.796 --> 00:22:10.139]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:11.901]  Achieve financial independence.
[00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:17.367]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[00:22:17.687 --> 00:22:18.909]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[00:22:18.969 --> 00:22:21.672]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[00:22:22.052 --> 00:22:27.998]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.

[00:23:00.399 --> 00:23:05.803]  Did you know that you can trace every sickness, every disease, and every ailment ultimately to mineral deficiency?
[00:23:05.943 --> 00:23:14.250]  Did you also know that 99% of American people are deficient in minerals and a marked deficiency in any one of the more important elements actually results in disease?
[00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.071]  More than likely, this includes you.
[00:23:16.251 --> 00:23:19.374]  Arm yourself with the minerals you need from Mother Earth Minerals.
[00:23:19.634 --> 00:23:32.720]  Mother Earth Minerals specializes in providing the primary building blocks for nutritional supplementation, including liquid, water-soluble, elemental mineral suspensions, contain the essential nutrients required for the proper function of muscles, nerves, blood vessels, and organs.

[00:23:54.411 --> 00:23:56.292]  Again, call 866-989-9876 or visit MotherEarthMineralsInc.com.
[00:24:08.943 --> 00:24:18.206]  All right, we're back live, and I've got to get Charles Goyette back on the program here in the near future.
[00:24:18.226 --> 00:24:19.767]  Very interesting fella.
[00:24:19.807 --> 00:24:24.209]  Go to his website, charlesgoyette.com, and get all the details of his fine program.
[00:24:24.389 --> 00:24:29.291]  There, heard many areas, of course, in Arizona and worldwide on the web.
[00:24:30.532 --> 00:24:34.515]  Let's take a few final calls and hit a few final news items here in this short segment.
[00:24:34.615 --> 00:24:37.138]  Fred and Marilyn, then we'll go across the country to Idaho.
[00:24:37.538 --> 00:24:38.699]  Fred and Marilyn, go ahead.
[00:24:38.719 --> 00:24:39.840]  How you doing, Alex?
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:40.280]  Good.
[00:24:41.121 --> 00:24:44.624]  Yeah, I just want to know if you thought Deep Road was...
[00:24:45.336 --> 00:24:51.017]  Actually used by the Zionist leg of the global elite to bring down President Nixon.
[00:24:51.037 --> 00:24:52.538]  Do you have any comments on that?
[00:24:52.678 --> 00:24:54.498]  I mean, why would they want to bring down Nixon?
[00:24:54.538 --> 00:24:56.399]  Why would the globalists want to bring down Nixon?
[00:24:56.439 --> 00:24:59.379]  Why would anybody want to bring down Nixon in the establishment?
[00:24:59.419 --> 00:25:05.941]  I mean, the guy was price fixing and government manipulation and taking us off the gold standard and...
[00:25:07.021 --> 00:25:07.702]  Yeah, you are so right.
[00:25:07.742 --> 00:25:10.564]  I don't know how... There must be something about conservatives.
[00:25:10.604 --> 00:25:12.485]  They sign up and then they go brain-dead.
[00:25:24.394 --> 00:25:24.594]  My God!
[00:25:47.312 --> 00:25:53.554]  I've got Congressional Budget Office graphs going back over 100 years, and every time a Republican's in, and I'm not defending the Democrats.
[00:25:53.574 --> 00:25:53.954]  No, you're right.
[00:25:54.054 --> 00:25:54.414]  You're right.
[00:25:54.454 --> 00:25:58.275]  I mean, Mount Everest pops up every time.
[00:25:58.635 --> 00:25:58.815]  Yep.
[00:25:58.955 --> 00:26:02.897]  I mean, they're just explosive spikes because they know they can scam conservatives.
[00:26:03.217 --> 00:26:04.297]  We'll all go to sleep.
[00:26:04.577 --> 00:26:06.558]  When they're in there, they're wolves in sheep's clothing.
[00:26:06.578 --> 00:26:07.218]  Anything else, Fred?
[00:26:08.198 --> 00:26:16.801]  I just want to say I've been watching TV and it's amazing how Pat Buchanan has really been defending Nixon and speaking bad against the guy known as Deep Throat.
[00:26:16.961 --> 00:26:17.861]  Well, he worked for him.
[00:26:17.881 --> 00:26:20.522]  And look, I don't believe this guy is fully Deep Throat.
[00:26:20.682 --> 00:26:23.163]  We know that Kissinger was also doing some leaking.
[00:26:23.963 --> 00:26:26.064]  Deep Throat was a composite of individuals.
[00:26:26.124 --> 00:26:29.025]  That's what I have from very good sources.
[00:26:29.065 --> 00:26:29.385]  Charles?
[00:26:29.845 --> 00:26:32.927]  Hey, I just want to mention one other thing before we're going to run out of time.
[00:26:33.988 --> 00:26:40.272]  You and I spoke on my show last week, I guess it was, and we archived it on my show at CharlesGoyette.com.
[00:26:40.292 --> 00:26:41.273]  We have our show archives.
[00:26:41.373 --> 00:26:48.198]  And, Alex, you'll be happy to know, I'm happy to know, that you are in our top five of downloads from around the world.
[00:26:48.618 --> 00:26:48.978]  Oh, really?
[00:26:49.018 --> 00:26:49.859]  Well, that's exciting.
[00:26:49.959 --> 00:26:50.960]  You're in good company, yeah.
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.180]  Fred, thanks for the call.
[00:26:53.001 --> 00:26:55.723]  Go ahead, Mike in Idaho, you're on the air.
[00:26:55.763 --> 00:26:56.083]  Welcome.
[00:26:56.463 --> 00:26:57.364]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:26:57.484 --> 00:26:57.844]  Good.
[00:26:58.064 --> 00:26:58.685]  Excellent guest.
[00:26:59.341 --> 00:27:04.724]  Hey, maybe Charles would like to tell you guys about the special gun squads that are forming out of Phoenix now.
[00:27:05.385 --> 00:27:06.806]  The special gun squads?
[00:27:06.846 --> 00:27:07.386]  Enlighten me.
[00:27:07.686 --> 00:27:08.206]  Yeah.
[00:27:08.447 --> 00:27:08.987]  Well, they just...
[00:27:09.542 --> 00:27:12.083]  They just formed special squads of police.
[00:27:12.464 --> 00:27:21.068]  Oh, yeah, no, you're talking about knock and talk with that psychopath Arpaio where they go around going, we want to talk about the guns you have, ma'am.
[00:27:21.849 --> 00:27:22.929]  Were you aware of that, Charles?
[00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.631]  There is nothing that this man will not do.
[00:27:25.671 --> 00:27:31.854]  You know, there was a time that a couple of years ago he wanted to put up roadblocks in and out of our county.
[00:27:32.314 --> 00:27:36.997]  Every single car coming and going would be stopped and subject to inspection.
[00:27:37.037 --> 00:27:37.677]  This guy's insane.
[00:27:39.378 --> 00:27:46.720]  Last night I watched about an hour of unedited footage inside his camp with a documentary crew who was there spending a week with him.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.140]  The man is a, and I've interviewed him four times, is a lunatic.
[00:27:50.621 --> 00:27:52.401]  I mean, an egomaniac.
[00:27:52.781 --> 00:27:53.861]  You ought to see it, folks.
[00:27:54.201 --> 00:27:55.362]  He's something else.
[00:27:55.402 --> 00:27:58.362]  The other day he had an uncontrolled incident in his vehicle.
[00:27:58.762 --> 00:28:00.543]  Ran into a shopping center.
[00:28:00.563 --> 00:28:03.063]  He said, well, the car suddenly accelerated by itself.
[00:28:03.684 --> 00:28:04.604]  And here's the problem.
[00:28:04.624 --> 00:28:05.164]  Now, the guy was...
[00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:11.369]  The news was virtually silent out here in Arizona.
[00:28:11.469 --> 00:28:12.630]  Everybody's afraid of him.
[00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:14.692]  This has always happened 150 years ago.
[00:28:14.812 --> 00:28:17.214]  People got bad sheriffs.
[00:28:17.294 --> 00:28:22.699]  It's unbelievable the way Americans have developed an attitude of kowtowing or deferring to power.
[00:28:22.839 --> 00:28:23.999]  But that's conservative.
[00:28:24.019 --> 00:28:25.240]  Turning your guns in is good.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.780]  I'm an evil liberal because I'm against that.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:31.741]  Is there some new development with the knock-and-talk squads?
[00:28:31.941 --> 00:28:34.501]  No, I just heard they were forming special gun squads.
[00:28:34.541 --> 00:28:35.742]  It was in the paper down there.
[00:28:36.242 --> 00:28:38.862]  How's the recall effort on Joe off-pilot crap going?
[00:28:39.542 --> 00:28:41.283]  All right, thanks for the call, sir.
[00:28:41.303 --> 00:28:42.943]  Yeah, it's not going anywhere, to tell you the truth.
[00:28:43.983 --> 00:28:46.284]  Well, that's because, again, gun control is conservative.
[00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:48.350]  We're good to go.
[00:28:48.390 --> 00:28:48.951]  We're good to go.
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:15.523]  Look, I mean, look, the evidence of a good crime control problem, good crime prevention problem is empty jails.
[00:29:15.703 --> 00:29:18.584]  Our evidence in Arizona is full jails.
[00:29:18.764 --> 00:29:20.105]  There's something wrong.
[00:29:20.285 --> 00:29:23.186]  Well, he was stumbling around in this video, and I mean stumbling around.
[00:29:23.547 --> 00:29:27.348]  He's going, yeah, the troops are in hot tents, and a guy goes, hey, I'm in the Marines.
[00:29:27.388 --> 00:29:28.089]  I just got back.
[00:29:28.529 --> 00:29:29.449]  We got air conditioners.
[00:29:29.489 --> 00:29:30.450]  He goes, shut up.
[00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:32.070]  I mean, he is just out of control.
[00:29:33.818 --> 00:29:35.699]  Drunk with power is the operative term.
[00:29:36.159 --> 00:29:39.300]  Charles, I want to thank you for coming on with us, and Godspeed, my friend.
[00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.020]  We'll talk really soon, Alex.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:41.800]  I thank you very much.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:42.841]  Enjoy visiting with you.
[00:29:42.861 --> 00:29:43.301]  Take care.
[00:29:43.641 --> 00:29:43.801]  Bye.
[00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:44.861]  All right, folks.
[00:29:44.881 --> 00:29:49.202]  We'll be right back with Sully Castillo, an incredible patriot, a good friend of mine.
[00:29:49.222 --> 00:29:50.643]  Stay with us.
[00:29:51.343 --> 00:29:52.263]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.743 --> 00:29:54.364]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.264 --> 00:29:57.945]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.286 --> 00:30:09.251]  Did you know that sugar, that sweet and simple, inoffensive-looking, refined substance you use in your coffee and cupcakes, actually reduces your body's ability to protect you?
[00:30:09.631 --> 00:30:10.912]  It suppresses your immune system.
[00:30:11.112 --> 00:30:11.793]  Now check this out.
[00:30:12.153 --> 00:30:15.575]  The average American consumes 2 to 3 pounds of sugar on average each week.
[00:30:15.875 --> 00:30:18.057]  That's about 120 pounds of sugar per year.
[00:30:18.537 --> 00:30:20.418]  Do you know what happens when your immune system
[00:30:20.418 --> 00:30:20.578]  I think.
[00:30:36.229 --> 00:30:40.350]  For a limited time only, get Agaricus Bio at 20% off the regular retail price.
[00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.691]  Call 877-817-9829 to order Agaricus Bio at 20% off.
[00:30:42.711 --> 00:30:44.091]  That's 877-817-9829 or visit www.thepowermall.com.
[00:30:44.111 --> 00:30:45.832]  Agaricus Bio, because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:30:46.212 --> 00:30:46.992]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com.
[00:31:01.036 --> 00:31:09.303]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.544 --> 00:31:13.908]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:14.208 --> 00:31:23.116]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:23.336 --> 00:31:26.939]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:27.219 --> 00:31:32.268]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.569 --> 00:31:39.301]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:39.782 --> 00:31:40.322]  What about you?
[00:31:40.996 --> 00:31:41.696]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[00:31:41.736 --> 00:31:42.997]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.468 --> 00:32:08.370]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:14.312]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[00:32:14.712 --> 00:32:24.714]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, ethanoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[00:32:24.854 --> 00:32:27.255]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[00:32:27.595 --> 00:32:30.616]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[00:32:31.096 --> 00:32:32.277]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[00:32:32.397 --> 00:32:39.881]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[00:32:40.142 --> 00:32:41.883]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[00:32:42.223 --> 00:32:53.970]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:58.833]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[00:33:07.288 --> 00:33:08.449]  We're good to go.
[00:33:08.489 --> 00:33:09.550]  We're good to go.
[00:33:09.590 --> 00:33:10.491]  We're good to go.
[00:33:10.531 --> 00:33:11.391]  We're good to go.
[00:33:11.411 --> 00:33:12.332]  We're good to go.
[00:33:12.352 --> 00:33:13.072]  We're good to go.
[00:33:13.133 --> 00:33:14.173]  We're good to go.
[00:33:14.213 --> 00:33:15.194]  We're good to go.
[00:33:35.948 --> 00:33:39.449]  I just want to make that absolutely clear here on air.
[00:33:40.709 --> 00:33:46.370]  I don't sell magic creams or any of that type of stuff or magic orbs.
[00:33:47.111 --> 00:33:50.431]  I don't like being associated with it, and I'll say that on record.
[00:33:52.412 --> 00:33:59.253]  What I do like being associated with is the GCN Radio Network and their zero censorship policy, the great job, the wonderful support they've given me.
[00:34:00.554 --> 00:34:02.154]  And we are victims of our own success.
[00:34:03.274 --> 00:34:06.875]  Hundreds of thousands of people a day, online, listen to the radio show.
[00:34:08.315 --> 00:34:12.376]  And even big monsters like Clear Channel cannot give any of their radio shows up for free.
[00:34:12.896 --> 00:34:15.196]  They charge for everything because they just can't pay for it.
[00:34:16.216 --> 00:34:17.517]  Bandwidth is very expensive.
[00:34:17.537 --> 00:34:19.037]  Well, the network doesn't do what they do.
[00:34:20.557 --> 00:34:27.879]  Others who don't have that many visitors, I guess there's a few radio things out there that are free, but they don't get enough visitors for it to be a big bill, so they continue to offer for free.
[00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.299]  But the network does.
[00:34:30.563 --> 00:34:51.180]  Because they have an 8-kilobit, which is listenable, that is free and will always be free, and a 16-bit and archives for, what, $7.95 a month, and then that pays for the employee to put the archives up and for IT and for the streams and for paying for the bandwidth, which, I don't know, has been upwards of, I don't know, $10,000 sometimes.
[00:34:53.352 --> 00:35:08.982]  And so we are able to offer the 8-bit and basically wake up new people, and at the same time people that want to support the network can get a 16-bit membership or a 32-bit, which is incredible sound quality, you know, in the room with a person, by going to GCNlive.com.
[00:35:09.563 --> 00:35:12.345]  GCNlive.com.
[00:35:12.405 --> 00:35:15.887]  I don't make a red cent off this, but I believe in it, and it's important.
[00:35:16.716 --> 00:35:25.902]  And I want to support the network so we can continue to expand and do an even better job and provide our affiliates with all these great digital satellites, you name it.
[00:35:25.982 --> 00:35:26.722]  It's very expensive.
[00:35:27.302 --> 00:35:30.965]  So it's a way to get higher quality listening online and to support this network.
[00:35:31.245 --> 00:35:33.006]  I want to thank all those that have subscribed.
[00:35:33.486 --> 00:35:35.648]  We have monthly and then six-month subscriptions.
[00:35:35.668 --> 00:35:41.551]  You can also go to the website and pick an entire month of any show you want, including mine, for $19.95 on MP3, high-quality audio.
[00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:48.677]  Plays on almost all the new CD players and on all computers.
[00:35:49.658 --> 00:35:51.258]  Again, folks, an entire month.
[00:35:51.298 --> 00:35:52.919]  Listen when you want, how you want.
[00:35:53.679 --> 00:35:54.940]  Those are $19.95.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:01.322]  Or get unlimited archives for $7.95 and beef it up for the streams to, what, $9.95.
[00:36:02.183 --> 00:36:02.923]  Great deal.
[00:36:03.103 --> 00:36:05.044]  GCNlive.com.
[00:36:05.084 --> 00:36:06.885]  GCNlive.com.
[00:36:08.245 --> 00:36:09.245]  So please take action.
[00:36:09.265 --> 00:36:10.306]  And then two other notes.
[00:36:10.996 --> 00:36:13.977]  Coming up this Friday, 7 and 10 p.m., two showings.
[00:36:14.117 --> 00:36:14.797]  One isn't enough.
[00:36:14.817 --> 00:36:20.799]  7 and 10 p.m., two showings of my new film, Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:36:21.119 --> 00:36:23.200]  The most powerful film I've ever produced.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.261]  I'll give a short speech before, take questions and answers after.
[00:36:26.601 --> 00:36:28.421]  At the Alamo Draft House, downtown Austin.
[00:36:29.742 --> 00:36:31.462]  7 and 10 p.m., the early show and the late show.
[00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:32.923]  People ask which show to go to.
[00:36:32.963 --> 00:36:33.923]  They're both going to be great.
[00:36:34.263 --> 00:36:35.343]  They're both going to be just as good.
[00:36:35.663 --> 00:36:37.704]  I'll have my books and videos there at some tables.
[00:36:38.573 --> 00:36:42.195]  I'll be there shaking your hand and always loving to get a chance to meet you and talk to you.
[00:36:43.356 --> 00:36:52.182]  And then, of course, coming up next week, Wednesday, June 8th, Wednesday, June 8th, one showing, 8 p.m., Alamo Draft House Cinema on South Lamar.
[00:36:53.142 --> 00:36:59.467]  Now, it looks like the first showing may sell out even before people get to the door on online.
[00:37:00.587 --> 00:37:02.769]  So go to InfoWars.com right now.
[00:37:02.929 --> 00:37:04.610]  Link through if you want to go to the first showing.
[00:37:05.703 --> 00:37:07.064]  Man, I've got to put people on the guest list.
[00:37:07.124 --> 00:37:08.685]  I just remembered that before it sells out.
[00:37:08.745 --> 00:37:09.725]  I'm about to do that.
[00:37:11.106 --> 00:37:11.587]  Oh, man.
[00:37:12.627 --> 00:37:14.048]  I've got to do that as soon as I get off air.
[00:37:14.088 --> 00:37:15.109]  Put people on the guest list.
[00:37:15.169 --> 00:37:16.089]  Friends of people that are coming.
[00:37:17.150 --> 00:37:18.691]  Oh, they won't be able to get in.
[00:37:19.171 --> 00:37:21.172]  One time we had a showing and we turned away 200 people.
[00:37:22.393 --> 00:37:24.954]  That's why we're having three showings.
[00:37:25.455 --> 00:37:27.796]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[00:37:28.016 --> 00:37:28.617]  Link through.
[00:37:28.677 --> 00:37:30.458]  Get your tickets online at DraftHouse.com.
[00:37:31.585 --> 00:37:39.608]  And if any of these do sell out, I'll post on the site and announce Friday on air so you don't show up and get turned away, because I hate that.
[00:37:40.328 --> 00:37:43.670]  If anything sells out by Friday, I will tell you on air.
[00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.750]  All right?
[00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:54.854]  But I don't think the online ticket sales will sell out for the 10 o'clock show.
[00:37:55.663 --> 00:37:57.204]  But get there early at the door.
[00:37:57.364 --> 00:38:01.666]  And I think you can go a few days before and go ahead and buy a ticket now.
[00:38:01.686 --> 00:38:02.847]  In fact, I'm sure you can do that.
[00:38:02.907 --> 00:38:06.349]  So if you live in Austin and want to do that, I mean, we're victims of our own success.
[00:38:06.389 --> 00:38:14.493]  Maybe next time that we do this, we'll have a couple weeks where it's showing, and I'll come to a few of the events because there's been that big of a response.
[00:38:14.533 --> 00:38:18.295]  And I want to thank Radio Free Austin and others for promoting this.
[00:38:19.359 --> 00:38:20.560]  So, again, that's coming up.
[00:38:20.740 --> 00:38:25.222]  And if you want to get a hard copy of Martial Law, my best film, call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:38:25.242 --> 00:38:25.963]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:38:51.107 --> 00:38:52.108]  So please take action.
[00:38:52.128 --> 00:38:52.168]  888-253-3139.

[00:39:12.583 --> 00:39:20.369]  All right, Selly Castillo, such an incredible individual, amazing courage, has risked his life valiantly.
[00:39:21.581 --> 00:39:23.989]  In Vietnam for what he believed was a fight for this country.
[00:39:24.350 --> 00:39:28.022]  Later found out that was a fraud and valiantly went against the grain and stood up.
[00:39:28.887 --> 00:39:35.432]  Fought in counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, you know, raids on drug compounds all over Latin America.
[00:39:35.452 --> 00:39:36.513]  I mean, a real tough guy.
[00:39:36.533 --> 00:39:39.675]  Not these punk SWAT team guys that raid little old ladies.
[00:39:40.016 --> 00:39:40.876]  The real deal.
[00:39:41.177 --> 00:39:42.297]  Did that for 12 years.
[00:39:42.377 --> 00:39:48.342]  Moved up to the head of DEA's drug enforcement for all of Latin America.
[00:39:48.522 --> 00:39:49.403]  Very senior.
[00:39:49.423 --> 00:39:52.245]  You know, met with the Security Council, others.
[00:39:52.265 --> 00:39:53.266]  I mean, very high level.
[00:39:53.986 --> 00:39:56.108]  And found out the government was dealing with drugs.
[00:39:56.798 --> 00:40:01.560]  We've had Terry Reid on and others who were there on the other end, and Mina unloading the cocaine.
[00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:07.541]  But he's here today to talk about that some, his incredible book, Powder Burns, his website, powderburns.org.
[00:40:07.821 --> 00:40:12.443]  He'll be with us for the rest of the broadcast, and we'll take your calls in the next hour, but please hold calls for now.
[00:40:12.843 --> 00:40:14.263]  Shelly, thank you for coming on.
[00:40:14.283 --> 00:40:15.784]  Thank you for the invitation.
[00:40:16.804 --> 00:40:24.787]  Sally, just for those who don't know who you are, in a brief nutshell or thumbnail sketch, give us a synopsis of Sally Costello's Awakening.
[00:40:24.967 --> 00:40:26.288]  You know, what happened in your life?
[00:40:26.308 --> 00:40:29.629]  Tell us about your roots, how you grew up, why you went to NOM, what happened?
[00:40:29.989 --> 00:40:39.713]  Well, basically, I come from a very patriotic family, creating our roots back to the revolutionist Emiliano Zapata, and basically...
[00:40:41.346 --> 00:40:43.927]  Every member of my family served our country.
[00:40:45.067 --> 00:40:53.048]  Like other families, we ended up paying the ultimate price with one of my uncles who was killed in World War II.
[00:40:53.508 --> 00:40:58.569]  My father himself was shot six times in the Philippines in an ambush.
[00:40:59.629 --> 00:41:08.831]  Being the only son in the family, my dad says, you've got to pay your dues to your country and serve your country in Vietnam, which I probably did at that time period.
[00:41:09.853 --> 00:41:14.096]  Went to Vietnam, became a sniper and a combative.
[00:41:14.136 --> 00:41:19.981]  Was awarded the Bronze Star for bravery and of course the combat infantry badge and so forth.
[00:41:20.061 --> 00:41:26.906]  And it was there in Vietnam where I saw a lot of my fellow soldiers die of overdose of heroin.
[00:41:27.486 --> 00:41:35.553]  And I promised myself that if I did survive that war, that I would start my own personal war as an agent with the Drug Enforcement Administration, which I did in 1979.
[00:41:40.568 --> 00:41:42.189]  And then the rabbit hole got a lot deeper.
[00:41:42.229 --> 00:41:42.969]  Please continue.
[00:41:43.410 --> 00:41:58.481]  Yes, and basically, you know, I did serve my country in Vietnam, came back, and became a police officer for about six years, working the midnight shift from 11 to 7, and my first class at the university was at 745.
[00:42:00.023 --> 00:42:00.584]  We're good to go.
[00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:00.824]  I think?
[00:42:21.861 --> 00:42:30.845]  You know, at that time period, I was hired as one of the first Mexican-Americans that was assigned to the New York field office.
[00:42:31.666 --> 00:42:36.728]  And I was there in New York City working deep cover on organized crime families for about four years.
[00:42:37.588 --> 00:42:49.814]  And then the jungles were calling again, and this time it was in South America, where it was there that I saw that my government was involved with letting those third world countries sleep with the cartels.
[00:42:50.598 --> 00:42:52.799]  In the name of democracy.
[00:42:52.899 --> 00:42:55.301]  And we were building what was known as cocaine democracies.
[00:42:58.523 --> 00:43:12.011]  So basically from there I just went to Central America where I got involved in what was known as the Iran-Contra investigation where every agency in our government was sleeping with the cartels and the enemies.
[00:43:12.151 --> 00:43:19.796]  And at the end of the day I realized that my biggest problem was not the cartels but the
[00:43:20.797 --> 00:43:30.665]  The CIA itself being involved in drug trafficking, and I couldn't understand why one arm of the government was fighting the so-called war on drugs while the other arm was actually sleeping with the cartels.
[00:43:30.805 --> 00:43:35.189]  Because then they get those centralized power, build private prisons, put our young people in them.
[00:43:35.629 --> 00:43:36.130]  Exactly.
[00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:37.951]  For 15 to 20 cents an hour.
[00:43:38.372 --> 00:43:41.995]  They then get to set up checkpoints and build outdoor camps like Arpaio.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:43.801]  They're in Phoenix.
[00:43:43.841 --> 00:43:45.883]  They get to turn America into a police state.
[00:43:46.244 --> 00:43:52.612]  And that's basically what's happening now today, and it's continuing to happen, and people are just standing still, not doing anything about it.
[00:43:52.792 --> 00:43:58.680]  And we've got to go back and remember that that's how Hitler started his whole regime.
[00:43:59.761 --> 00:44:00.782]  People were so scared to...
[00:44:01.733 --> 00:44:04.674]  To stop this individual, and before they tried, it was too late.
[00:44:04.714 --> 00:44:05.955]  They had created this monster.
[00:44:06.435 --> 00:44:08.876]  Well, I'm looking at a picture here with you and George Bush Sr.
[00:44:08.936 --> 00:44:11.077]  I'm looking at a picture of you in Vietnam, pictures of you.
[00:44:11.717 --> 00:44:15.018]  They're on the side of the helicopter in Guatemala with your snub-nosed M16.
[00:44:17.439 --> 00:44:23.522]  And how long were you in Latin America before you began to learn who was, I mean, hardcore evidence?
[00:44:24.683 --> 00:44:34.187]  I mean, of course you got inklings, so go through when you first got inklings, and then when you finally got all the hardcore evidence of who was really behind the majority of the narcotics.
[00:44:34.327 --> 00:44:38.189]  Well, my first inkling was in Peru, and when I was humping the jungles of...
[00:44:39.387 --> 00:44:54.464]  The Amazon, the Wayaga Valley down there in Tingo Maria, a little village called Tingo Maria, that was the first time I saw the Peruvian military playing soccer, soccer ball with the Colombian traffickers.
[00:44:55.433 --> 00:45:08.141]  And it was then and there I realized that there was no such thing as the war on drugs because even in those little villages in the Amazon, people did not deal in Peruvian money, but they dealt strictly in dollars.
[00:45:08.601 --> 00:45:14.966]  Even the banks from Peru would fly down to those villages and pick up dollars for the banks.
[00:45:15.686 --> 00:45:18.848]  So it was there then that I realized that something wrong was happening.
[00:45:19.523 --> 00:45:21.304]  Something was definitely wrong with this picture.
[00:45:21.544 --> 00:45:38.111]  Well, to use a fictional example, and by the way, he just got busted at a checkpoint, Oliver Stone lived with the cartels, and then, of course, he wrote Scarface, and that film, I've talked to so many former top drug dealers, so many government agents, they say that film is so accurate.
[00:45:39.128 --> 00:45:40.970]  It shows how the banks and the U.S.
[00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:46.314]  government are really controlling the drugs, and Tony Montana, this fictional drug lord from Miami, meets with the U.S.
[00:45:46.374 --> 00:45:51.738]  government with a top drug lord deciding how to assassinate people.
[00:45:51.979 --> 00:45:54.701]  They're in the film, but in reality, that's really going on.
[00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:55.722]  Absolutely.
[00:45:55.742 --> 00:45:59.084]  Especially now, you know, people say Mexico's poor.
[00:46:00.225 --> 00:46:02.967]  Mexico's one of the richest countries in the world.
[00:46:04.108 --> 00:46:08.312]  We have more banks in South Texas than we do 7-Eleven's or Circle K's.
[00:46:09.032 --> 00:46:17.517]  That kind of indicates and tells you that there's more drug money in this country than ever before in the history.
[00:46:17.657 --> 00:46:19.558]  I've said it once and I'll say it again.
[00:46:20.038 --> 00:46:23.760]  If we were to stop drug trafficking in a few days, our banking systems would collapse.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.881]  That's how much they depend on that drug money.
[00:46:27.541 --> 00:46:29.322]  It's unbelievable, Sally.
[00:46:30.043 --> 00:46:32.384]  Let's go over some of the hardcore evidence of U.S.
[00:46:32.424 --> 00:46:35.626]  government complicity, and they go, well, I hear about them busting cartels.
[00:46:36.066 --> 00:46:41.269]  Those are cowboys, as they say in Scarface, the corrupt cops telling Tony Montana to pay him off.
[00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:43.031]  He says, you're going to feed me bus.
[00:46:43.071 --> 00:46:44.812]  You know, we like snacks.
[00:46:45.192 --> 00:46:46.393]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:46:46.433 --> 00:46:49.855]  They throw you a bone, as they say.
[00:46:50.275 --> 00:46:53.297]  And that's what happened with the Cali cartel and the...
[00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:57.039]  And the Medellin cartel, the U.S.
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:47:22.118]  government was actually sleeping with the Cali cartel and they were giving each other up up there and they were having a little civil war of who's going to control the drug trade and basically the Medellin cartel lost at the very end and the Cali cartel took over and still runs the majority, 80-90% of the drugs, of the cocaine that comes in from Colombia is in the U.S.
[00:47:22.158 --> 00:47:23.239]  because of the Cali cartel.
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:31.463]  Now, you told a story before how your informants, government agents, you were getting phone calls.
[00:47:31.483 --> 00:47:36.265]  Other people in your own organization were talking about these airfields.
[00:47:38.646 --> 00:47:39.086]  Exactly.
[00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:45.409]  You know, we had satellite photos from the CIA in South America and Central America.
[00:47:45.429 --> 00:47:52.433]  They were all conductive airstrips that were being used by our government to smuggle drugs into the country.
[00:47:52.693 --> 00:47:52.813]  And...
[00:47:54.432 --> 00:47:56.576]  It started out in Guatemala again.
[00:47:56.616 --> 00:48:02.867]  We were refueling in an undercover capacity, planes full of cocaine going into the U.S.,
[00:48:04.426 --> 00:48:09.829]  Then when they were never getting busted and so forth, I said, well, something's wrong with this picture.
[00:48:09.849 --> 00:48:15.432]  We keep refueling these planes, and they're never being seized in the U.S., what the problem is.
[00:48:15.512 --> 00:48:19.654]  I finally realized that it was a covert operation being run by the White House.
[00:48:20.575 --> 00:48:28.199]  When it was brought up to the attention of the ambassadors and DEA headquarters, the only thing they could say to me was it was a covert operation being run by the White House.
[00:48:28.786 --> 00:48:29.887]  And for me to stay away from it.
[00:48:30.747 --> 00:48:31.947]  But you didn't stay away from it?
[00:48:32.148 --> 00:48:32.868]  Absolutely not.
[00:48:32.908 --> 00:48:40.431]  Not only did I not stay away from it, I took it to a higher level, and I started taking pictures, and I started documenting.
[00:48:40.471 --> 00:48:43.553]  I have journals where I've documented the flights coming and going.
[00:48:43.593 --> 00:48:50.956]  And a lot of this, I mean, never before seen stuff that you just had on a disc and in the slides, you've now gotten up on your website.
[00:48:51.216 --> 00:48:51.716]  Exactly.
[00:48:51.796 --> 00:48:55.778]  I've got over a thousand pictures that I'm getting ready to be putting onto my website.
[00:48:56.519 --> 00:48:57.781]  The good, the bad, and the ugly.
[00:48:57.921 --> 00:49:01.306]  I've seen these photos when you come to town, but you're just now starting a site that's growing.
[00:49:01.547 --> 00:49:02.087]  That's correct.
[00:49:02.208 --> 00:49:07.836]  And I got people that were murdered and killed by the CIA.
[00:49:07.896 --> 00:49:09.219]  They were tortured by the CIA.
[00:49:09.239 --> 00:49:11.222]  I have the original passports of these people.
[00:49:12.006 --> 00:49:19.829]  And, you know, families have contacted me already in regards to, you know, my knowledge of what happened to those people down there.
[00:49:19.849 --> 00:49:22.450]  Well, I'll tell you, Sally, you just continue to fight for this country.
[00:49:22.510 --> 00:49:30.454]  I mean, you've always served this country, and you couldn't be serving this country and your family in what's good and decent and honorable in any better way.
[00:49:30.474 --> 00:49:32.354]  And I know it takes a lot of courage.
[00:49:32.395 --> 00:49:33.275]  A lot of people died.
[00:49:33.775 --> 00:49:37.099]  Well, you know, I consider myself now a veteran of my third and perhaps most dangerous war.
[00:49:37.159 --> 00:49:39.801]  And that's the war against the criminals in my own government.
[00:49:52.353 --> 00:49:54.875]  I'm not about to give up.
[00:49:55.535 --> 00:50:02.400]  I will continue to fight until I die or whatever, but I'm not going to stop.
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.522]  A long time ago I came to that fork in the road.
[00:50:06.224 --> 00:50:10.429]  And I've decided that the road I was going to travel was not going to be an easy one.
[00:50:12.131 --> 00:50:14.193]  But you couldn't stop, could you?
[00:50:15.114 --> 00:50:15.995]  Absolutely not.
[00:50:16.155 --> 00:50:21.140]  And, you know, if they can shoot and kill the President of the United States, they can definitely do me.
[00:50:21.201 --> 00:50:25.165]  But until that day comes, I will continue to fight to preserve my government.
[00:50:26.249 --> 00:50:34.408]  Well, you know, the scary thing is they try to get these hitmen who will go kill good patriots like yourself, but they're having trouble getting them to follow orders.
[00:50:34.929 --> 00:50:36.453]  That's why they're trying to recruit.
[00:50:37.276 --> 00:50:38.617]  Los Zetas and others.
[00:50:38.837 --> 00:50:39.437]  Do you agree with that?
[00:50:39.777 --> 00:50:40.457]  Absolutely.
[00:50:40.477 --> 00:50:43.618]  The Zetas are the ones that do the dirty work for the United States government.
[00:50:43.658 --> 00:50:48.040]  Not only, you know, back in the 80s, we used to use the ORL.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:53.442]  They still continue to use the School of the Americas to train those militias down in Central America.
[00:50:53.462 --> 00:50:59.444]  Well, stay there, because the death squads they trained in the 80s are now coming to Dallas, Texas, and Austin.
[00:51:02.242 --> 00:51:02.703]  We're good to go.
[00:51:22.346 --> 00:51:24.407]  And America is now a police state.
[00:51:24.467 --> 00:51:29.148]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.348 --> 00:51:33.749]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:33.989 --> 00:51:41.212]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:03.931]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:53:04.691 --> 00:53:07.312]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[00:53:08.050 --> 00:53:24.243]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[00:53:25.164 --> 00:53:30.388]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[00:53:31.195 --> 00:53:39.136]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:53:40.137 --> 00:53:40.677]  Just call 1-800-516-8736.
[00:53:40.697 --> 00:53:40.977]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[00:53:41.037 --> 00:53:42.437]  The call is free.
[00:53:42.457 --> 00:53:46.798]  Our operators are standing by to take your order for a year's subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:09.091]  I think?
[00:54:24.011 --> 00:54:24.711]  This is wonderful.
[00:54:24.731 --> 00:54:26.512]  So many good people come from this fine state.
[00:54:26.532 --> 00:54:30.274]  There's also a lot of cowards here that need to get involved in standing up for this country.
[00:54:30.294 --> 00:54:32.615]  I mean, I don't like legal drugs, illegal drugs.
[00:54:32.635 --> 00:54:34.776]  I don't like them pushing prescription drugs on our children.
[00:54:35.236 --> 00:54:37.017]  And I sure don't like all these illegal drugs.
[00:54:37.037 --> 00:54:41.779]  But we need to decriminalize now to take the money out of this.
[00:54:42.039 --> 00:54:43.980]  And then these criminal drug gangs will disappear.
[00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.601]  But the government doesn't want that because they control them.
[00:54:47.714 --> 00:55:01.767]  I knew from my sources and research, and it's even been admitted, you know, headline, Mexican commandos target police, threaten police, major danger, hundreds killed, blowing up cars in Dallas, shooting people, going after other drug dealers.
[00:55:02.388 --> 00:55:04.409]  And these guys were trained at the School of Americas.
[00:55:05.751 --> 00:55:07.792]  They are the official Mexican army, folks.
[00:55:07.812 --> 00:55:09.254]  They're seen right there with the units.
[00:55:10.580 --> 00:55:12.381]  They're just a covert action group.
[00:55:12.942 --> 00:55:15.723]  And Sully's been dealing with these people for a long, long time.
[00:55:16.144 --> 00:55:24.369]  And now the crime cartel back in the White House, this is documented, mainstream news, are taking the death squad commanders to Iraq to run things.
[00:55:24.729 --> 00:55:25.910]  They're moving them up here.
[00:55:26.850 --> 00:55:28.551]  This is very scary.
[00:55:28.871 --> 00:55:34.035]  These are the modern Hessians, like they used the Germans, the British did in two invasions of this country.
[00:55:34.295 --> 00:55:38.737]  Well, these Latin American death squads are now coming to America.
[00:55:38.797 --> 00:55:39.718]  Sully, tell us about it.
[00:55:40.018 --> 00:55:42.960]  Well, basically, let's go back to history a little bit.
[00:55:43.680 --> 00:55:48.664]  During the Phoenix programs, we had those same terror cells that I called, the American terror cells that...
[00:55:49.594 --> 00:55:58.321]  Where, you know, Felix Rodriguez, Oliver North, and all those people that were involved in the Phoenix program down in Vietnam, well, they brought the blueprints.
[00:55:58.882 --> 00:56:03.406]  McCaffrey brought it down to Central America, and they used it in Guatemala and El Salvador.
[00:56:03.926 --> 00:56:04.647]  And it worked.
[00:56:04.987 --> 00:56:08.170]  You know, they went out there and they trained the death squads and so forth.
[00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:17.638]  And, you know, we had terrorists like Posada, Luis Posada, and Felix Rodriguez, and other individuals that were instrumental in bringing terror to Central America.
[00:56:18.298 --> 00:56:26.045]  And from there, that same blueprint they used in Guatemala and in Vietnam, they have now brought it to Iraq.
[00:56:26.405 --> 00:56:38.575]  And the same colonel that ran the death squads down in El Salvador, Colonel James Steele, is now running those commando units, death squads, in Iraq.
[00:56:38.876 --> 00:56:40.137]  So basically we have...
[00:56:41.256 --> 00:56:54.471]  The same individuals, same cell groups that were in Vietnam that came to Central America and Miami and so forth and are now in Iraq and some of them are being trained here in South Texas.
[00:56:54.951 --> 00:56:58.235]  There's big ranches down here where they're training more
[00:57:01.257 --> 00:57:18.187]  Now, please, for those that missed that, you have evidence as a former veteran, peace officer, and then head DEA agent in Latin America, and you live in South Texas, that down there they are training these Las Zetas groups.
[00:57:18.887 --> 00:57:22.648]  And again, they're now targeting rival cowboys that aren't paying their cut.
[00:57:22.668 --> 00:57:23.569]  Do you agree with that statement?
[00:57:24.009 --> 00:57:24.529]  Absolutely.
[00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:27.950]  Not only that, but just recently, last month, we had a female U.S.
[00:57:28.010 --> 00:57:39.174]  Customs agent driving down the highway, and a couple of individuals drove up to her and just shot the hell out of that car, and she got hit on the ankle.
[00:57:39.234 --> 00:57:41.555]  They're not going to take any more prisoners.
[00:57:41.595 --> 00:57:43.836]  They're now going to target FBI agents.
[00:57:44.763 --> 00:57:57.494]  The agents, the people that were able to get away from being... And Bush has ordered the Border Patrol to stand down there in the Tucson sector because it was... This is official because it was cutting in on their drug profits.
[00:57:57.814 --> 00:57:58.494]  Well, exactly.
[00:57:58.554 --> 00:58:04.759]  And now they're planning to come to South Texas and they're going to do the same thing here in South Texas.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.223]  And there was a story just today in a paper where a Border Patrol agent says, you know what?
[00:58:10.024 --> 00:58:13.607]  We can't stop these people from coming across the border.
[00:58:14.087 --> 00:58:18.070]  And the reason is that we can't stop them is because our government is not letting us do it.
[00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:26.035]  Well, I read in the Brownsville paper, the Dallas Morning News, you name it, that they're conducting murders all over Texas, killing police officers.
[00:58:26.355 --> 00:58:28.997]  But it's a national secret, Shelly.
[00:58:29.057 --> 00:58:30.238]  It's in regional papers.
[00:58:30.738 --> 00:58:39.184]  Well, one of the most major things that people don't realize that's going on is that a lot of these people are getting murder or informants for the DEA and FBI.
[00:58:40.164 --> 00:58:46.789]  And basically people don't want to admit the fact or let the public know that these people are informants working for the government.
[00:58:47.869 --> 00:58:50.271]  Cop killers that work for Bush.
[00:58:51.432 --> 00:58:51.812]  Hello!
[00:58:57.635 --> 00:58:58.236]  Big brother.
[00:58:58.937 --> 00:58:59.977]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.697 --> 00:59:01.838]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.458 --> 00:59:03.298]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.038 --> 00:59:04.919]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.999 --> 00:59:09.220]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:13.921]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.961 --> 00:59:19.982]  We're now into our third hour of this June 1st, 2005 edition.
[00:59:20.562 --> 00:59:26.244]  Shelly Costello, Vietnam, veteran of the Army, highly decorated sniper, police officer,
[00:59:27.131 --> 00:59:40.359]  Then became a high-level DEA agent over the operations in Latin America, discovered the CIA, was controlling the predominant sources of cocaine, and of course heroin and many other goodies.
[00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:46.643]  Then your children use it and they put them in their private prisons, or they run the whorehouses and whore them out.
[00:59:46.703 --> 00:59:47.724]  It's quite a system.
[00:59:48.419 --> 00:59:50.481]  The drug war is a great success, turning America into a total police state.
[01:00:03.729 --> 01:00:06.452]  And Sully Castillo has just dropped bombshell after bombshell on us.
[01:00:06.492 --> 01:00:18.487]  They admit all over South Texas newspapers, all over Arizona and New Mexico papers, hundreds of killings by Lizetas, one group of, quote, former Mexican commandos trained at the U.S.
[01:00:18.507 --> 01:00:19.228]  military base.
[01:00:20.143 --> 01:00:20.764]  We're good to go.
[01:00:42.041 --> 01:00:47.726]  They're shooting at police left and right, injuring them left and right, but it's not a national news story.
[01:00:48.447 --> 01:00:51.130]  And, Sally, for those that just joined us, spell it out for us.
[01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:54.312]  Who are these, quote, former U.S.
[01:00:54.352 --> 01:00:55.293]  trained commandos?
[01:00:55.674 --> 01:00:56.995]  Why are they being protected?
[01:00:57.455 --> 01:01:05.022]  And explain how this nexus works and why the globalists are turning the heat up now and unleashing these hip gangs.
[01:01:05.442 --> 01:01:15.232]  Well, basically, they're controlling, you know, the cartels controlled Colombia for many years, and now they have controlled Mexico now.
[01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:28.625]  You know, our government, you know, that was the price that those old countries paid, like Mexico and Guatemala and Salvador, and their reward was for them to be able to sleep with the cartels, and now
[01:01:29.275 --> 01:01:32.818]  It's so huge now that it's spilled over into Mexico.
[01:01:33.338 --> 01:01:36.401]  And the government of Mexico is controlled by the cartels.
[01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:41.425]  All aspects from Colombian cartels to the Gulf cartels and so forth.
[01:01:41.885 --> 01:01:44.787]  And hence controlled by the CIA.
[01:01:45.008 --> 01:01:45.548]  Exactly.
[01:01:45.708 --> 01:01:50.212]  And now it's spilled over into the United States up here where we have a lot of murders.
[01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:53.614]  Just here close to my house, my residence.
[01:01:55.215 --> 01:02:01.638]  Last week, two young guys were assassinated there in their residence.
[01:02:01.658 --> 01:02:06.760]  They kneeled them down, they shot them behind the head, and it spilled over.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.501]  Crime is up here in the valley, and we have the sectors driving.
[01:02:10.521 --> 01:02:11.581]  We had a U.S.
[01:02:11.601 --> 01:02:12.982]  Customs agent who was just shot up.
[01:02:13.862 --> 01:02:41.393]  A couple of weeks ago by drug cartel members and so forth and a lot of the informants that used to work for the Mexican police have been fired and so forth so the best thing for them to do was become FBI informants and CIA and DEA informants are now being murdered here in the US because of their snitching on people.
[01:02:41.673 --> 01:02:53.236]  Isn't this really part of a drug war as the globalists attempt to reestablish control over conduits because prices have actually gone down because so many cowboys are circumventing the U.S.
[01:02:53.276 --> 01:02:55.297]  government monopoly?
[01:02:55.777 --> 01:02:56.297]  Absolutely.
[01:02:56.317 --> 01:02:57.498]  You've just got to remember one thing.
[01:02:57.538 --> 01:02:58.978]  We spend billions of dollars in...
[01:02:59.918 --> 01:03:02.179]  I mean, Peru, we can't even make a dent.
[01:03:02.219 --> 01:03:04.721]  We've got more drugs to dent than we ever had in the history.
[01:03:05.001 --> 01:03:05.941]  Well, Stella, you were there.
[01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:07.342]  You were the head of these operations.
[01:03:07.522 --> 01:03:07.842]  Absolutely.
[01:03:07.882 --> 01:03:10.784]  But they admitted that they only spray the farts fields.
[01:03:10.864 --> 01:03:14.486]  Two-thirds of Colombia, they don't even spray because that's our fields.
[01:03:14.586 --> 01:03:18.188]  You've got to remember one thing, that we have the best intelligence network in the world.
[01:03:18.368 --> 01:03:26.572]  We know by satellite photos where all these cultivations of coca leaves fields are, and we're not touching them.
[01:03:27.862 --> 01:03:29.143]  Unless it's FARC control.
[01:03:29.444 --> 01:03:29.924]  Exactly.
[01:03:31.185 --> 01:03:39.613]  And they sent, a few years ago, the head of the New York Stock Exchange, Grasso, went down and openly hugged the head of the FARC and said, you better deal with us, and he refused, so the invasion began.
[01:03:39.633 --> 01:03:40.473]  Yes, sir.
[01:03:40.513 --> 01:03:41.554]  That's exactly what happened.
[01:03:41.594 --> 01:03:44.037]  Wall Street went down there, and they said no to it.
[01:03:44.257 --> 01:03:50.102]  Tell us about it when we get back, Sully Costello, and I want to get more into these Zeta gangs and what you think is going to happen here in the next few years.
[01:03:50.542 --> 01:03:50.943]  Stay with us.
[01:03:53.129 --> 01:03:57.473]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.633 --> 01:04:02.078]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:06.622]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:08.004]  The New World Order.
[01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:14.006]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.066 --> 01:04:20.989]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:23.190]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.350 --> 01:04:33.875]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.115 --> 01:04:36.256]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is...
[01:04:36.516 --> 01:04:38.058]  That's 888-253-3139 Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:52.795 --> 01:05:01.399]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:05:01.619 --> 01:05:12.904]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[01:05:13.104 --> 01:05:15.765]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:16.105 --> 01:05:20.207]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled,
[01:05:20.427 --> 01:05:22.550]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:24.592]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:05:24.792 --> 01:05:30.819]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:05:31.079 --> 01:05:36.726]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:40.992]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.012 --> 01:05:41.713]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:05:41.733 --> 01:05:42.435]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.624 --> 01:05:54.064]  We're good to go.
[01:06:16.636 --> 01:06:17.276]  We're good to go.
[01:06:33.946 --> 01:06:36.088]  If don't take unnecessary risks.
[01:06:36.329 --> 01:06:39.972]  Keep your arteries healthy and clear by taking Heart and Body Extract.
[01:06:40.012 --> 01:06:43.315]  To get Heart and Body Extract, go to heartandbodyextract.com or call 1-866-295-5305.
[01:06:43.335 --> 01:06:43.836]  That's 866-295-5305.
[01:06:43.876 --> 01:06:44.356]  Call now.
[01:06:54.326 --> 01:07:00.351]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.972 --> 01:07:04.014]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.035 --> 01:07:10.019]  We're talking to a real American patriot, Sully Castillo, again, Vietnam veteran, highly decorated sniper.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.085]  Then he worked his way up as a law enforcement officer, peace officer in the police department in South Texas.
[01:07:17.105 --> 01:07:22.510]  Then he got into the DEA and in 12 years became the head of their Latin American operations.
[01:07:23.815 --> 01:07:28.258]  And he found out the government was controlling the cartels and then just going after their competition.
[01:07:29.178 --> 01:07:35.201]  And I knew what Sully would say before I'd talk to him because the guy's got good info and I've got a lot of the same info.
[01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:36.742]  His is just even deeper.
[01:07:36.762 --> 01:07:39.884]  And I called him up and I said, Sully, what do you think about Las Zetas?
[01:07:40.244 --> 01:07:48.949]  He supposed, you know, rogue Mexican military all over Texas and Arizona killing police and blowing up cars.
[01:07:48.969 --> 01:07:51.550]  I mean, imagine if Muslims were blowing up cars in Dallas.
[01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:53.131]  Blowing cars up!
[01:07:53.917 --> 01:07:57.018]  It'd be all over the news, but no, it's never outside Texas.
[01:07:57.698 --> 01:08:00.019]  It's never out... Hundreds of deaths.
[01:08:00.399 --> 01:08:09.522]  I got a Fox News piece we put up on the website, but local Fox News, in Laredo, where it shows all the shops empty for months, everybody moving out, the killings are everywhere.
[01:08:10.803 --> 01:08:11.463]  It's horrible.
[01:08:12.423 --> 01:08:14.204]  And the Border Patrol's been ordered to stand down.
[01:08:14.244 --> 01:08:15.865]  We've talked to Border Patrol union people.
[01:08:15.905 --> 01:08:17.605]  They say, look, these guys work for the government.
[01:08:17.885 --> 01:08:18.826]  They're totally protected.
[01:08:18.846 --> 01:08:22.547]  We've been ordered, when we're shot at by these troops, to not return fire.
[01:08:23.268 --> 01:08:24.511]  I mean, that is insane!
[01:08:25.233 --> 01:08:28.741]  And Bush has ordered the Border Patrol to stand down because people were cutting back.
[01:08:28.781 --> 01:08:31.367]  Some of the Border Patrol was cutting back on their drug shipments.
[01:08:32.578 --> 01:08:33.839]  All of this is going on.
[01:08:34.179 --> 01:08:41.325]  And the government, that is the banks that control our government, are making the lion's share of the profits and using the drug money to take over the third world.
[01:08:41.385 --> 01:08:45.148]  I'm just recapping what Sally and I have talked about in the last 30 minutes.
[01:08:45.348 --> 01:08:50.753]  But Sally, I want to get into the mechanisms of the drug war and how it controls society.
[01:08:50.773 --> 01:08:59.700]  But let's get back into how Las Zetas are trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, now at Covert Ranches that you know of in South Texas.
[01:09:00.442 --> 01:09:04.523]  And then, you know, more of the history of the death squads.
[01:09:04.924 --> 01:09:08.225]  I mean, for those that don't know, first death squads in Latin America.
[01:09:08.565 --> 01:09:13.186]  Now they're using the same crews, commanded by the same people in Iraq.
[01:09:13.226 --> 01:09:17.508]  And now they're basically engaged in a war of enforcement against...
[01:09:18.181 --> 01:09:19.702]  Government competition.
[01:09:20.262 --> 01:09:22.282]  All the cowboys that have driven down prices.
[01:09:23.042 --> 01:09:23.483]  Exactly.
[01:09:23.523 --> 01:09:25.763]  You know, there's a history about the death squads.
[01:09:25.803 --> 01:09:30.325]  You know, they all, Major Davison from El Salvador, Major Larcon.
[01:09:30.885 --> 01:09:39.067]  A lot of these people were former military soldiers that went to the School of the Americas at Fort Benning, Georgia, where they've been training.
[01:09:39.247 --> 01:09:45.349]  And they trained there, and then they come back, and they train the people on how to torture people and how to kill people and so forth.
[01:09:46.022 --> 01:09:58.867]  And a lot of the CETAS guys were also counterintelligence units that win array because of making more money for the cartels and so forth.
[01:09:58.947 --> 01:10:03.369]  And they've come across the border now and they're training here in South Texas.
[01:10:03.429 --> 01:10:06.430]  They're having problems training in Mexico because of the military.
[01:10:07.148 --> 01:10:09.670]  But they've trained up here in South Texas.
[01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.892]  Got to be clear, who is training them?
[01:10:12.232 --> 01:10:20.298]  Yes, well, basically a lot of the, believe it or not, a lot of the people that are training them are probably contract agents from the CIA.
[01:10:20.838 --> 01:10:22.820]  They're being trained down here in South Texas.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:32.107]  We've got a lot of soldier of fortune type of individuals down here training to set us.
[01:10:32.627 --> 01:10:34.549]  And I myself have been approached by...
[01:10:35.409 --> 01:10:42.993]  Well, they're probably trying to get you in a relationship.
[01:10:43.313 --> 01:10:44.554]  But of course money is no object.
[01:10:44.574 --> 01:10:46.675]  They've got millions of dollars.
[01:10:47.195 --> 01:10:49.336]  I mean, they have protection.
[01:10:50.176 --> 01:10:54.539]  They even know when an indictment is coming out in the U.S.
[01:10:54.599 --> 01:10:55.019]  government.
[01:10:55.759 --> 01:10:57.000]  Before the indictment comes out.
[01:10:57.080 --> 01:10:59.161]  So that means they got people in place.
[01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:00.142]  The U.S.
[01:11:00.162 --> 01:11:02.604]  Attorney's Office, they got them in place with the DEA.
[01:11:03.004 --> 01:11:11.189]  There's a DEA agent that's been on the job here for 15 years, has been selling native information, DEA files, to the cartels.
[01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:20.595]  So, you know, their intelligence, it's much better than our government's intelligence because they got people in place with the U.S.
[01:11:20.635 --> 01:11:21.516]  branches of the government.
[01:11:22.139 --> 01:11:23.340]  Now, Shelly, let's be clear.
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:25.262]  You know, you've gotten death threats before I've gotten them.
[01:11:25.382 --> 01:11:29.345]  Clearly, if they're trying to contact you, it's so they can get you off in a truck somewhere.
[01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:31.047]  Exactly, basically.
[01:11:31.427 --> 01:11:36.671]  But, you know, like I said, as far as I'm concerned, I've been on borrowed time since Vietnam.
[01:11:37.372 --> 01:11:40.655]  So, you know, as they say, if you speak, they will come.
[01:11:41.155 --> 01:11:44.358]  And there's no doubt in my mind that one of these days you're going to hear that...
[01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:47.031]  Celica Steele was murdered.
[01:11:47.632 --> 01:11:50.294]  But I will never, ever commit suicide.
[01:11:50.354 --> 01:11:52.455]  I'm going on record right now on your show, Alex.
[01:11:53.556 --> 01:11:54.837]  On record?
[01:11:55.197 --> 01:12:00.861]  I've read from coroners and other experts that it's almost unheard of to be able to shoot yourself twice in the head, Celica.
[01:12:01.001 --> 01:12:01.542]  Yeah, I know.
[01:12:01.602 --> 01:12:02.763]  So I will never do that.
[01:12:02.783 --> 01:12:07.426]  I will never try to shoot myself twice or three times in the head.
[01:12:08.607 --> 01:12:14.291]  The easiest way for me, I'll probably have an 18-wheeler hit me on an expressway or something.
[01:12:16.381 --> 01:12:26.344]  Well, I think you've got a whole parcel of angels protecting you, Sully.
[01:12:26.664 --> 01:12:29.484]  Well, that's one of the big things that people keep telling me.
[01:12:29.504 --> 01:12:35.446]  You know, there's an angel out there, old man, protecting me and trying to get all those people off me.
[01:12:36.386 --> 01:12:38.807]  You know, I've gotten so many people, even the U.S.
[01:12:38.827 --> 01:12:40.447]  Attorney's Office here in McAllen has...
[01:12:41.437 --> 01:12:43.818]  I'm an expert witness on entrapment, informants and outrageous government conduct.
[01:13:01.315 --> 01:13:11.379]  And I get to find out of all the lies, all the perjury the government does on drug cases and other cases and so forth because I'm a thorn on their side.
[01:13:11.419 --> 01:13:12.759]  They call it liifying.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:15.901]  Yes, and they're probably going to be coming after me.
[01:13:17.061 --> 01:13:23.824]  Well, I mean, you go all over the country with your slideshow and all the photos, many of which you took of our own CIA smuggling the drugs.
[01:13:23.864 --> 01:13:24.844]  Yeah, unbelievable.
[01:13:24.904 --> 01:13:27.405]  I have the original passports of the people that were murdered.
[01:13:27.485 --> 01:13:29.846]  I have pictures before and after they were killed.
[01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:35.248]  And I have copies of my memos that I wrote to Washington telling them about this murder.
[01:13:35.748 --> 01:13:39.869]  Well, we're going to go to calls in a few minutes, but I want to, for those that just joined us, this is so important.
[01:13:40.390 --> 01:13:46.992]  We have a whole bunch of mainstream news articles about hundreds of murders, Mexican troops trained by the U.S.
[01:13:47.012 --> 01:13:50.353]  government, killing federal officers, wounding them, killing cops.
[01:13:51.033 --> 01:13:55.355]  But it's a news blackout nationally, and from all the evidence...
[01:13:56.127 --> 01:13:59.292]  They are going after other small cowboy operations.
[01:13:59.473 --> 01:14:00.735]  Our government's ignoring them.
[01:14:01.396 --> 01:14:04.982]  And, Shelly, on the record, from your intelligence, who are these guys really working for?
[01:14:06.199 --> 01:14:14.123]  Well, they're basically working for the cartels, number one, which in turn work for the governments.
[01:14:14.644 --> 01:14:18.986]  And, you know, the cartels have controlled the governments for many, many years.
[01:14:19.526 --> 01:14:22.327]  And by government, who is the head government controlling those governments?
[01:14:22.347 --> 01:14:24.208]  Well, the United States government, number one.
[01:14:24.489 --> 01:14:27.950]  You know, every country in Latin America the U.S.
[01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:28.791]  government controls.
[01:14:29.891 --> 01:14:33.173]  I had Randy Kapster, a CIA official, once tell me, look,
[01:14:33.985 --> 01:14:35.825]  We control these countries.
[01:14:35.905 --> 01:14:37.266]  We elect the presidents.
[01:14:37.886 --> 01:14:40.506]  And if they refuse to play ball with us, then we take them out.
[01:14:40.686 --> 01:14:43.567]  And his prime example was Noriega in Panama.
[01:14:43.587 --> 01:14:44.547]  Well, look at Chavez.
[01:14:44.767 --> 01:14:45.827]  Yeah, and Chavez now.
[01:14:45.847 --> 01:14:48.428]  Chavez refused to play, so they're going after Chavez.
[01:14:48.448 --> 01:14:50.328]  They publicly kidnapped him once.
[01:14:50.648 --> 01:14:51.289]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:14:51.509 --> 01:14:54.249]  But then the army didn't go along with it, so they had to release him.
[01:14:54.509 --> 01:14:54.989]  Exactly.
[01:14:55.229 --> 01:14:57.570]  And that's what happens, you know, that they...
[01:15:00.518 --> 01:15:02.499]  Well, they just disconnected Shelly.
[01:15:02.519 --> 01:15:04.239]  Are you going to be able to get him back?
[01:15:08.481 --> 01:15:10.582]  All of our phone system went down again.
[01:15:11.782 --> 01:15:14.984]  Very interesting that that happened.
[01:15:15.044 --> 01:15:17.265]  It's very suspicious how that happens with key guests.
[01:15:17.805 --> 01:15:22.727]  But I'm sure it's all just a gremlin hopscotching about in the equipment.
[01:15:22.827 --> 01:15:26.128]  But get him back on or use one of the back lines.
[01:15:26.968 --> 01:15:28.409]  Use one of the other backup lines.
[01:15:29.717 --> 01:15:31.778]  And get him back on that way if you have to.
[01:15:31.798 --> 01:15:32.939]  Don't wait for it to come back up.
[01:15:32.959 --> 01:15:33.560]  Did it come back up?
[01:15:37.503 --> 01:15:37.823]  Okay.
[01:15:38.303 --> 01:15:38.644]  All right.
[01:15:38.704 --> 01:15:40.645]  So we're getting Shelly back on.
[01:15:42.327 --> 01:15:48.772]  Folks, our Border Patrol, when they're shot at by Mexican troops in light armored vehicles, are told to not return fire.
[01:15:50.533 --> 01:15:50.933]  Okay.
[01:15:51.574 --> 01:15:56.298]  The Los Altos are seen getting out of official Mexican vehicles and then coming across the border
[01:15:57.037 --> 01:16:05.458]  Killing smugglers that don't pay their cut, killing drug dealers on this side, killing cops, killing informants, killing people that don't play ball.
[01:16:06.499 --> 01:16:12.440]  And this is how the globalists love to operate, with a membrane of separation to carry out their dirty work.
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.741]  And it is as obvious as the nose on my face, and I'm glad that Selly from his intel concurs with that.
[01:16:18.781 --> 01:16:26.262]  You've got all these CIA guys down in South Texas training them on bases right now for just a reign of terror
[01:16:27.897 --> 01:16:32.679]  Oh, you can't get enough FBI agents and enough former Delta Force guys to go around killing patriots.
[01:16:32.719 --> 01:16:37.701]  Well, we'll just have an army of death squad commandos from Latin America.
[01:16:38.021 --> 01:16:39.302]  The same guys they're shipping over.
[01:16:40.307 --> 01:16:42.768]  To Iraq right now, and that's public mainstream news.
[01:16:43.208 --> 01:16:45.468]  Shelly, a strange little thing with the phone system there.
[01:16:45.508 --> 01:16:46.389]  Thanks for joining us again.
[01:16:46.629 --> 01:16:47.669]  It doesn't surprise me.
[01:16:48.809 --> 01:16:50.610]  Yeah.
[01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:55.931]  Shelly, I want to go to break in a minute and take calls, but any other key things you want to talk about, developments we need to know about?
[01:16:56.672 --> 01:17:01.673]  The only thing I keep telling the American people, I know the paycheck clock, it's going to get worse before it gets better.
[01:17:01.693 --> 01:17:03.774]  If it gets better, so we need to do something.
[01:17:03.794 --> 01:17:08.995]  We need to either demonstrate, go out there and do something, take it to a different level, because this
[01:17:10.233 --> 01:17:10.954]  It's not working.
[01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:12.494]  Whatever we're doing, it's not working.
[01:17:12.514 --> 01:17:19.397]  We need to do something drastic to wake up these people in America and stop being in denial.
[01:17:21.378 --> 01:17:27.640]  Well, the controllers, the overlords, love criminality because it infects the entire society and then they can control it.
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:28.561]  Exactly.
[01:17:28.641 --> 01:17:39.305]  But, you know, I think we need to just take it to a different level because it's late for our kids now
[01:17:40.086 --> 01:17:43.127]  And the only thing we got left is trying to save our grandkids.
[01:17:43.967 --> 01:17:47.988]  And that's basically... You were part of a big protest a few weeks ago, a big wig.
[01:17:48.048 --> 01:17:49.428]  Lord Baker came to town.
[01:17:49.889 --> 01:17:52.449]  Yes, we had a major demonstration a couple of years ago.
[01:17:52.509 --> 01:17:56.950]  We had Bush Daddy that came up to the university up here.
[01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:58.591]  And then we had James Baker come up here.
[01:17:58.611 --> 01:17:59.431]  And we demonstrated.
[01:17:59.471 --> 01:18:00.411]  We got students.
[01:18:00.631 --> 01:18:01.852]  We got about 300 students.
[01:18:02.332 --> 01:18:03.372]  That was a few months ago.
[01:18:03.792 --> 01:18:04.832]  Yeah, a couple of months ago.
[01:18:04.952 --> 01:18:06.893]  So believe it or not, their name...
[01:18:07.836 --> 01:18:10.337]  Their next speaker for next year is going to be Rush Limbaugh.
[01:18:11.538 --> 01:18:13.219]  We'll be here at the university.
[01:18:13.479 --> 01:18:14.659]  So we're looking for him.
[01:18:14.679 --> 01:18:16.440]  So what did you guys say at the protest?
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.361]  Well, we protested.
[01:18:18.381 --> 01:18:24.684]  We let the rich people that came in and were paying $1,000 a plate or whatever, let them know who Baker was.
[01:18:24.724 --> 01:18:29.686]  Not that they don't know, but of course it was another Republican fundraiser.
[01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:31.467]  And that's basically what it was.
[01:18:32.851 --> 01:18:34.733]  Well, James Biker's a piece of work.
[01:18:35.034 --> 01:18:49.771]  Yeah, well, you know, he was the attorney for the Carlyle Company and the Saudi Arabians, and he's also defended the win against the families from 9-11 when they filed a class action suit, and he was the attorney for the Saudis.
[01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:51.573]  A bottomless pit of evil.
[01:18:51.614 --> 01:18:52.094]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.115 --> 01:18:57.721]  Finally, for millions of Americans at risk with high cholesterol, there's Liquid Quell.

[01:19:27.243 --> 01:19:33.705]  Quill lowered my cholesterol significantly in 30 days, something I couldn't do with diet and exercise in two to three years.
[01:19:34.005 --> 01:19:40.568]  Gentle, fast-acting liquid quail is available at major wholesale clubs nationwide and online at quaildirect.com.

[01:19:47.752 --> 01:19:50.973]  Quail is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.
[01:19:51.173 --> 01:19:52.354]  Individual results may vary.
[01:19:53.106 --> 01:19:53.826]  Terrorism.
[01:19:54.026 --> 01:19:54.747]  Terrorism.
[01:19:54.867 --> 01:19:55.707]  Chemical attacks.
[01:19:55.767 --> 01:19:56.447]  Dirty bombs.
[01:19:56.547 --> 01:19:56.947]  Fallout.
[01:19:57.027 --> 01:19:58.007]  Biological attack.
[01:19:58.208 --> 01:19:58.748]  Anthrax.
[01:19:58.828 --> 01:20:00.948]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:20:01.188 --> 01:20:02.789]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:20:03.029 --> 01:20:05.510]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:20:05.890 --> 01:20:20.454]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:20:20.494 --> 01:20:20.834]  government.
[01:20:20.994 --> 01:20:22.795]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:20:23.175 --> 01:20:29.077]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:20:29.237 --> 01:20:33.719]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[01:20:54.632 --> 01:20:59.237]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[01:20:59.557 --> 01:21:01.900]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.661]  Achieve financial independence.
[01:21:04.042 --> 01:21:09.127]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.

[01:21:10.729 --> 01:21:13.412]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[01:21:52.763 --> 01:21:55.185]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:22:22.435 --> 01:22:30.577]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[01:22:34.197 --> 01:22:34.998]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:22:35.018 --> 01:22:35.258]  Call now.
[01:22:35.318 --> 01:22:39.059]  Our operators are standing by to receive your call.
[01:23:01.305 --> 01:23:06.848]  You know, in my film, Martial Law, I cover several hundred points, proving the globalists carried out 9-11.
[01:23:08.169 --> 01:23:30.462]  But one point I didn't cover, and I should have, and if I ever put out another edition, I will, is that publicly, James Baker III, the former Secretary of State, the big lawyer for the vote scam in 2000, the Carwell Group chieftain, the confidant of the Bushes, went and defended the Saudis against the victims of 9-11, and was involved in covering that up.
[01:23:30.502 --> 01:23:30.702]  I mean...
[01:23:31.457 --> 01:23:34.099]  And the Bushes' vacation with the Bin Ladens, we do cover that.
[01:23:34.479 --> 01:23:41.425]  It's just that how in bed with these groups they are, how they control the terrorists and the criminals and the drug gangs.
[01:23:41.805 --> 01:23:42.926]  And it's always public.
[01:23:42.946 --> 01:23:44.287]  You can always prove it, Sally.
[01:23:44.507 --> 01:23:46.869]  You can interview the people that have witnessed it, like yourself.
[01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:49.671]  But still, they stay in power.
[01:23:49.711 --> 01:23:50.612]  Nothing happens to them.
[01:23:51.392 --> 01:23:51.893]  Exactly.
[01:23:51.913 --> 01:23:57.517]  You know, one of the problems I foresee is the fact that Americans don't read it.
[01:23:58.899 --> 01:24:02.642]  And, you know, when you do read, you've got to just believe out of what you read.
[01:24:03.242 --> 01:24:08.405]  But, basically, the American people are like hostages with the head in the ground.
[01:24:08.445 --> 01:24:13.389]  And as long as it doesn't bother them in the immediate area, they're not going to do anything about it.
[01:24:13.649 --> 01:24:16.090]  And that's the problem we're having with America.
[01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:19.453]  We're not responding like we're supposed to be responding.
[01:24:19.513 --> 01:24:20.833]  We're taking things for granted.
[01:24:21.394 --> 01:24:27.658]  And before you know it, we will lose our civil liberties because our government is just going to completely take over.
[01:24:28.346 --> 01:24:32.588]  And once they do that, martial law comes into effect and so forth.
[01:24:32.648 --> 01:24:37.671]  And a lot of people think we're conspiracist theories and so forth, but the writing's on the wall, man.
[01:24:37.711 --> 01:24:52.740]  If you don't see the tortures that we're committing all over the world, with Donald Bay, you know, here in the U.S., you know, we trained the terrorists in the School of the Americas and how to torture people and so forth.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:56.982]  You know, we're the worst human rights violators in the world.
[01:24:57.745 --> 01:25:00.307]  And Amnesty International just spoke about that.
[01:25:00.728 --> 01:25:03.370]  And what Bush's response is, it's garbage.
[01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:04.150]  It's not true.
[01:25:04.471 --> 01:25:05.411]  I mean, how can that be true?
[01:25:05.471 --> 01:25:09.775]  It's in the news every other day or so that our American troops are committing this atrocity.
[01:25:09.795 --> 01:25:16.720]  Well, what they do is their own army reports say raping people's wives in front of them, beating innocent people to death, raping them with battery acid.
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:17.681]  I can't say any more.
[01:25:17.701 --> 01:25:20.003]  I mean, this is the admissions.
[01:25:20.143 --> 01:25:23.626]  And then Alberto Gonzalez says in memos that are published...
[01:25:24.006 --> 01:25:25.246]  He admits there is memos.
[01:25:25.286 --> 01:25:27.387]  Hey, we're allowed to torture people to death.
[01:25:27.667 --> 01:25:29.447]  Exactly, and we did it in Vietnam.
[01:25:29.487 --> 01:25:37.029]  But then they plant something about, well, maybe Newsweek didn't talk to the right person, and maybe this case isn't true, but a thousand others are admitted.
[01:25:37.429 --> 01:25:37.929]  Exactly.
[01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:44.351]  And, you know, when you talk to the American people, it says, well, you know, there's casualties of war.
[01:25:45.091 --> 01:25:49.032]  You know, I mean, so what happens when the American troops get tortured and so forth?
[01:25:49.932 --> 01:25:50.732]  Is it the same thing?
[01:25:50.752 --> 01:25:53.213]  Well, I mean, when you have the... Look, evil doesn't just...
[01:25:54.372 --> 01:25:56.474]  Once you can do this stuff, it spreads.
[01:25:56.754 --> 01:25:58.455]  It's like cancer.
[01:25:58.555 --> 01:26:00.636]  It just spreads and spreads and spreads.
[01:26:01.097 --> 01:26:03.118]  You try to cut it off, and it grows up somewhere else.
[01:26:03.959 --> 01:26:04.539]  And so forth.
[01:26:04.579 --> 01:26:14.646]  So, you know, we're giving it a carte blanche for the American troops to do whatever they want to do, and they're doing it, and they're making examples of some of them, but not the majority of them.
[01:26:14.906 --> 01:26:20.090]  Well, they get the official orders to torture people, but then a few of the troops get in trouble, and the people that gave the orders...
[01:26:21.076 --> 01:26:21.776]  Oh, it's incredible.
[01:26:21.816 --> 01:26:23.837]  Bill in Toronto, Canada, then Ruben and others.
[01:26:23.897 --> 01:26:24.497]  Bill, go ahead.
[01:26:24.517 --> 01:26:25.658]  Yes, brother.
[01:26:26.438 --> 01:26:31.460]  I'd like to... That man that is talking to you, I'd like him to listen to what I have to say.
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:32.840]  Okay?
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:33.360]  Please?
[01:26:34.381 --> 01:26:34.621]  Alex?
[01:26:34.961 --> 01:26:35.761]  Yeah, you're on the air, Bill.
[01:26:36.041 --> 01:26:36.762]  Okay, listen.
[01:26:36.922 --> 01:26:37.702]  I have books.
[01:26:38.702 --> 01:26:40.023]  Adopt Incorporated.
[01:26:40.043 --> 01:26:43.404]  This book has been wrote by Lyndall LaRoche.
[01:26:43.604 --> 01:26:44.564]  Maybe you've heard about him.
[01:26:46.165 --> 01:26:49.166]  And it's exposing the Queen Elizabeth
[01:26:50.655 --> 01:27:00.618]  The TGB, the CIA, the Mossad, they're all co-working together, the secret societies, to dope the global young generation.
[01:27:00.978 --> 01:27:02.339]  Well, look at Bush and New Freedom.
[01:27:02.399 --> 01:27:04.340]  Forced psychological testing, forced drugging.
[01:27:04.700 --> 01:27:05.000]  Yes.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:07.301]  Can I please say something?
[01:27:07.541 --> 01:27:13.483]  When my father was as a colonel in the German army, he sometimes was very angry with American people.
[01:27:13.523 --> 01:27:17.624]  When we immigrated from Brazil to the United States, he didn't like the Americans.
[01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:19.060]  You know why?
[01:27:19.341 --> 01:27:20.101]  Don't get me wrong.
[01:27:20.741 --> 01:27:26.424]  Because American GIs used to rape German women during the war.
[01:27:26.964 --> 01:27:27.904]  Just like Russians.
[01:27:28.845 --> 01:27:31.986]  They are all equally guilty of the crimes committed.
[01:27:32.386 --> 01:27:35.528]  They have no love, no respect for the civilian population.
[01:27:35.908 --> 01:27:37.889]  Downsizing civilian population.
[01:27:38.409 --> 01:27:41.150]  Either shooting them, or poisoning them.
[01:27:41.631 --> 01:27:42.351]  Nothing different.
[01:27:43.283 --> 01:27:49.871]  Well, I mean, throughout history, militarized societies, whether it's the German Army or the American Army, engaged in these atrocities.
[01:27:49.891 --> 01:27:51.493]  In the past, though, they got condemned.
[01:27:51.854 --> 01:27:52.935]  Now they're being legitimized.
[01:27:52.975 --> 01:27:53.276]  Sully?
[01:27:53.816 --> 01:27:54.297]  Absolutely.
[01:27:54.357 --> 01:27:57.241]  Now it's carte blanche for them to do that.
[01:27:57.661 --> 01:27:59.724]  And that's why, see, people don't understand.
[01:27:59.744 --> 01:28:02.047]  You know, Americans don't understand why we're being hated.
[01:28:02.512 --> 01:28:17.598]  The reason we're hated is because we're not letting those third world countries practice democracy, real democracy, you know, the right to vote, human rights, civil liberties, and so forth.
[01:28:17.919 --> 01:28:20.360]  We're not allowing those things to happen in those third world countries.
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:23.341]  That's why people from all over the world hate us now.
[01:28:24.202 --> 01:28:26.603]  Bill, I'm going to let you finish up and we'll get back briefly.
[01:28:26.703 --> 01:28:28.444]  And again, it's not America that's doing this.
[01:28:28.484 --> 01:28:34.086]  It's America that's been captured and is being used as a tool to empower these monsters.
[01:28:34.126 --> 01:28:35.126]  And it's time to wake up.
[01:28:35.586 --> 01:28:37.707]  They create the crises and offer the solution.
[01:28:38.047 --> 01:28:39.388]  More of your call straight ahead.
[01:28:39.408 --> 01:28:39.848]  Stay with us.
[01:28:43.629 --> 01:28:44.530]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.030 --> 01:28:46.631]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:46.651 --> 01:28:50.232]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:55.999 --> 01:29:00.064]  Hi, I'm Tom Valentine, and I want to tell you about the Sacro Wedgie.
[01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:03.008]  I don't endorse many products, but I'm endorsing this one.
[01:29:03.289 --> 01:29:10.378]  If you've got back pain, sciatica, hip pain, leg pain, knee pain, then you need to listen very closely to this message.
[01:29:10.836 --> 01:29:18.938]  For more than 10 years now, the Sacro Wedgie has helped thousands find relief from the symptoms and pain of back problems.

[01:30:55.912 --> 01:30:58.373]  It's not if a catastrophic event will occur, but when.
[01:30:58.714 --> 01:31:02.376]  When are all of our resources, the things we take for granted, going to be pulled out from under us?
[01:31:02.676 --> 01:31:07.538]  When this happens, we're going to have to take care of ourselves and our loved ones with the only resources we already have.
[01:31:07.859 --> 01:31:08.559]  Don't wait for when.
[01:31:08.819 --> 01:31:09.940]  It's important to act now.

[01:31:39.442 --> 01:31:40.944]  We're good to go.
[01:32:07.198 --> 01:32:15.040]  All we want is the corruption to be brought under control.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:17.740]  Evil's always been with us.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:18.820]  It's always going to be here.
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:21.701]  Until God puts a final stop to it.
[01:32:22.381 --> 01:32:25.741]  But it's our job to put it back in the closet, to kick it back under the cave.
[01:32:27.822 --> 01:32:29.562]  Tyranny is the norm in history.
[01:32:31.162 --> 01:32:33.363]  Freedom is the very rare gemstone.
[01:32:33.903 --> 01:32:34.743]  Almost unknown.
[01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:41.465]  And our founding fathers told this to the public in their day.
[01:32:42.005 --> 01:32:42.986]  You can read their writings.
[01:32:43.386 --> 01:32:44.747]  Common sense tells us this.
[01:32:44.807 --> 01:32:45.828]  History shows us this.
[01:32:46.348 --> 01:32:47.629]  But not as they teach the children.
[01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:48.690]  Government's only good.
[01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:49.391]  Submit to it.
[01:32:49.451 --> 01:32:49.911]  Trust it.
[01:32:50.171 --> 01:32:51.092]  We're going to surveil you.
[01:32:51.112 --> 01:32:52.733]  We're going to take all your rights to keep you safe.
[01:32:53.074 --> 01:32:53.454]  Shut up.
[01:32:53.494 --> 01:32:54.094]  We're the boss.
[01:32:54.535 --> 01:32:55.736]  We're going to wear a black mask.
[01:32:55.776 --> 01:32:57.497]  We're going to strut around and tell you what to do.
[01:32:57.517 --> 01:33:00.359]  And we're going to draft your children.
[01:33:00.379 --> 01:33:01.920]  We're going to invade all these countries.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.162]  And it doesn't matter how much we lie to you.
[01:33:04.302 --> 01:33:05.323]  It's in your own good interest.
[01:33:08.306 --> 01:33:13.249]  And they scare us into submission with terrorism and the threat of drugs and all of this.
[01:33:13.289 --> 01:33:17.551]  And then every time that we give up more liberty, the terrorism, the drugs, all of it just gets worse.
[01:33:17.571 --> 01:33:19.412]  We're about to go back to Bill and Ruben and Wes and others.
[01:33:20.272 --> 01:33:24.674]  But I want you to go to powderburns.org, powderburns.org.
[01:33:26.015 --> 01:33:29.757]  Selling Castillo's great website that's getting bigger every day, full of so much great information.
[01:33:30.117 --> 01:33:31.478]  And get his book, Powder Burns.
[01:33:31.918 --> 01:33:35.320]  You couldn't be supporting a more brave, patriotic, good American.
[01:33:37.425 --> 01:33:44.092]  Shelby, before we go back to Bill and Ruben and Wes to take a bunch of calls here, the toll-free number is 800-259-9231.
[01:33:45.814 --> 01:33:46.935]  Dig deep into your heart.
[01:33:47.075 --> 01:33:49.497]  Speak to the police officers that are listening right now.
[01:33:50.758 --> 01:34:01.609]  They're going to pull over some teenager today that will have a few marijuana cigarettes, and they're going to take them to jail, where they're going to perhaps be raped, or where they're going to get into more serious criminal activities.
[01:34:03.915 --> 01:34:05.916]  Those cops know their bosses deal with drugs.
[01:34:05.957 --> 01:34:07.117]  They know it's all a big joke.
[01:34:07.137 --> 01:34:08.758]  They know the private prisons are a scam.
[01:34:10.119 --> 01:34:15.043]  What would you say to the men in the military who are being recruited to command death squads right now?
[01:34:15.383 --> 01:34:19.506]  What would you say to Las Zetas if they're listening out there about what they're doing?
[01:34:22.127 --> 01:34:24.729]  Oh, just a phone system just went down again.
[01:34:25.810 --> 01:34:26.510]  Very magically.
[01:34:27.031 --> 01:34:27.851]  So we'll get him back up.
[01:34:27.891 --> 01:34:31.714]  But I mean, that's a very important question because I know what I'm talking about.
[01:34:32.427 --> 01:34:39.010]  I know they knowingly shit blood for eight years out of state prisons they knew had HIV and hepatitis in it, killing tens of thousands.
[01:34:39.490 --> 01:34:42.931]  I know that they know that it's killing the troops with the depleted uranium and they don't care.
[01:34:43.271 --> 01:34:44.852]  I know they're doing all this stuff to them.
[01:34:45.352 --> 01:34:48.173]  I know we've got psychopathic criminals running this country.
[01:34:49.313 --> 01:34:50.614]  And all the callers, I'm sorry.
[01:34:51.912 --> 01:34:52.873]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:34:54.934 --> 01:35:01.577]  When that phone system comes back up, we'll try to batter through your calls as quickly as possible, since we're having this problem.
[01:35:01.597 --> 01:35:02.858]  Will you have Sully back?
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:13.264]  Well, while we're waiting for Sully, coming up this Friday, two showings of my new film, Martial Law, 7 and 10 p.m.
[01:35:13.584 --> 01:35:14.404]  Choose either showing.
[01:35:14.424 --> 01:35:15.025]  It's going to be great.
[01:35:15.085 --> 01:35:16.546]  Alamo Draft House, downtown Austin.
[01:35:16.566 --> 01:35:18.347]  7 and 10 p.m.
[01:35:20.413 --> 01:35:21.835]  Two and a half plus hour film.
[01:35:21.875 --> 01:35:24.758]  We'll show it at 7 and 10 p.m.
[01:35:24.918 --> 01:35:31.484]  And then coming up next week, coming up next week at 8 p.m.
[01:35:32.425 --> 01:35:37.130]  on the 8th at the Alamo Draft House on South Lamar.
[01:35:37.931 --> 01:35:43.517]  And you can get tickets via InfoWars.com, link through over to the Alamo Draft House website, or buy them at the door.
[01:35:44.688 --> 01:35:52.616]  Or if you want to get any of my videos, the toll-free number to call, you can ask about the titles, the different specials, what the different films cover.
[01:35:53.277 --> 01:35:55.019]  They can read you a brief synopsis.
[01:35:55.039 --> 01:35:56.100]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:35:56.120 --> 01:35:56.160]  888-253-3139.
[01:36:07.924 --> 01:36:09.844]  And I want to thank those that have gotten the films.
[01:36:09.884 --> 01:36:12.865]  This is our sole form of support for this broadcast.
[01:36:13.445 --> 01:36:14.646]  For my website, it's what we do.
[01:36:16.826 --> 01:36:18.706]  For those that have gotten the films, I want to thank you.
[01:36:18.786 --> 01:36:22.067]  Please call and get them.
[01:36:22.087 --> 01:36:29.769]  888-253-3139 Or watch them all online right now at prisonplanet.tv 15 cents a day, monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:36:30.592 --> 01:36:34.440]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[01:36:40.899 --> 01:36:42.240]  Please get martial law.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:51.144]  It shows how the globalists carried out 9-11, how they're turning America into a police state, and who the globalists are, what their ideology is, what they're really up to.
[01:36:51.184 --> 01:36:54.285]  It is such an important video.
[01:36:54.305 --> 01:37:05.290]  888-253-3139, or order a hard copy via Infowars.com, or as I said, PrisonPlanet.tv, or if you live in Central Texas, I hope to see you at the Alamo Draft House this Friday night, or next Wednesday.
[01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:07.551]  Shelly, I don't know when you got cut off.
[01:37:07.651 --> 01:37:09.052]  The phone system keeps going down, which...
[01:37:10.101 --> 01:37:13.203]  Normally happens about twice a year, but it's been happening lately during Key Guest.
[01:37:13.483 --> 01:37:14.423]  Yeah, I guess so.
[01:37:14.883 --> 01:37:21.186]  I was posing the question about how to wake up our police, how to wake them up to the system they're part of.
[01:37:21.827 --> 01:37:26.509]  Because if the enforcers refuse to go along with this, the globalists won't be able to carry out their plans.
[01:37:27.918 --> 01:37:28.358]  Exactly.
[01:37:28.818 --> 01:37:32.600]  I guess it's what you need to do with the police officers, officials, or whatever.
[01:37:33.120 --> 01:37:34.440]  Educate them on what's going on.
[01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:46.544]  A lot of them know already, but the problem with that is that they have a mortgage to pay, they have college tuition for their kids, and they don't want to be compromised.
[01:37:46.604 --> 01:37:50.085]  They all want to live comfortably and so forth.
[01:37:50.185 --> 01:37:53.646]  And they're told, bust so many punk kids with marijuana.
[01:37:53.926 --> 01:37:54.126]  Yeah.
[01:37:54.793 --> 01:38:11.019]  And you know, they're realizing that we're incarcerating our youth, this generation, and we're losing them completely, whether it's from the war or it's being incarcerated for drugs or so forth.
[01:38:11.039 --> 01:38:13.419]  So, you know, we've got to educate.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:20.562]  I've always said that the solution to the drug war, the so-called drug war, has got to be education, prevention and treatment.
[01:38:21.297 --> 01:38:33.506]  Well, I mean, how can they arrest a 15-year-old with some marijuana or some other drug and then go put him in a prison that's owned by the drug cartels, literally a private prison, when everybody knows the government's shipping it in, Sally?
[01:38:34.046 --> 01:38:34.467]  Exactly.
[01:38:34.487 --> 01:38:41.532]  Not only that, we know that, for example, the President of the United States used drugs at one time or another.
[01:38:41.552 --> 01:38:42.613]  He was an alcoholic.
[01:38:42.693 --> 01:38:43.834]  Masses of cocaine.
[01:38:44.134 --> 01:38:44.614]  Exactly.
[01:38:44.814 --> 01:38:47.957]  And, you know, we got Terry Reid in the book Compromise where...
[01:38:48.775 --> 01:38:53.718]  Where the Bush brothers were involved in buying drugs and so forth.
[01:38:56.119 --> 01:38:57.539]  This is what we got.
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:38:59.821]  What do we do now?
[01:38:59.861 --> 01:39:01.181]  How do we educate the public?
[01:39:01.221 --> 01:39:16.589]  I remember hiring people as being on the board on the DEA to employ students out of college that all used drugs at one time or another.
[01:39:17.455 --> 01:39:19.156]  And yet we ended up hiring these people.
[01:39:19.276 --> 01:39:28.400]  Well, I mean, with one hand they're pushing psychotropic drugs whose molecular structure is much more deadly than illegal narcotics.
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:30.160]  The government's pushing it aggressively.
[01:39:30.581 --> 01:39:33.822]  And then on the other hand, they're grabbing our children up to put them in these prisons.
[01:39:34.202 --> 01:39:34.642]  Exactly.
[01:39:34.922 --> 01:39:37.123]  So, you know, we've got a no-win situation here.
[01:39:37.243 --> 01:39:42.045]  What do you see happening in the next two years with these Las Zetas CIA-controlled drug gangs?
[01:39:42.105 --> 01:39:45.547]  Well, it's, you know, money breeds greed.
[01:39:46.207 --> 01:39:52.030]  And I think that they're going to run apart from whoever they're working with.
[01:39:52.610 --> 01:40:01.234]  They're going to start their own little terrorist cells or drug cells and there's going to be a little civil war between them and the government.
[01:40:01.830 --> 01:40:07.971]  And it's going to spill over into the U.S., and people are going to find themselves.
[01:40:08.071 --> 01:40:10.612]  Either you join it or you don't join it.
[01:40:10.632 --> 01:40:11.552]  You need to do something.
[01:40:11.572 --> 01:40:18.674]  And the globalists are going to love this, the controllers above all this, the overlords, because they're saying, we're going to put cameras up everywhere in Texas.
[01:40:18.694 --> 01:40:21.574]  We're going to search your houses to stop the Zeta gangs.
[01:40:22.115 --> 01:40:28.096]  And the recent intelligence I've gotten is that within the next seven years,
[01:40:28.880 --> 01:40:29.400]  The U.S.
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:35.363]  government is going to annex Mexico into the United States, and they're going to use drug trafficking, corruption, and so forth.
[01:40:35.383 --> 01:40:41.566]  And they're going to tell the Mexicans it's part of a lorica quista, and use pride to make them think they're taking over the U.S.
[01:40:41.586 --> 01:40:42.546]  when it's really the opposite.
[01:40:42.766 --> 01:40:43.207]  Exactly.
[01:40:43.527 --> 01:40:44.147]  Exactly!
[01:40:44.187 --> 01:40:46.148]  That's in the CFR plan!
[01:40:46.668 --> 01:40:54.932]  And I just got that intelligence from very high people up in the government, saying that that's the blueprint they've got now.
[01:40:54.972 --> 01:40:56.833]  They're going to be taking annex in Mexico,
[01:40:57.652 --> 01:41:00.314]  And into the United States, and they're going to use corruption.
[01:41:00.334 --> 01:41:06.558]  Meanwhile, they got their Ford Foundation out here with these fake so-called Hispanic groups telling them, oh no, we're taking over.
[01:41:06.738 --> 01:41:08.059]  Uh-uh, folks, it's the opposite.
[01:41:08.259 --> 01:41:09.140]  Yes, exactly.
[01:41:10.861 --> 01:41:12.843]  You know, these people are slick, Sully.
[01:41:13.603 --> 01:41:20.188]  Yeah, and you know, like I said, American people, you know, are very ignorant.
[01:41:21.148 --> 01:41:22.549]  And secondly, they're in denial.
[01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:25.571]  And they think it's going to go away.
[01:41:25.671 --> 01:41:26.552]  It's not going to go away.
[01:41:27.495 --> 01:41:30.657]  You know, it's here to stay, and you've got to do something.
[01:41:30.677 --> 01:41:34.999]  You just can't sit there and be neutral about the whole thing.
[01:41:35.059 --> 01:41:40.761]  If you're going to run for public office, man, you better not stand on the fence.
[01:41:40.801 --> 01:41:43.183]  You better make a decision which way you're going to go.
[01:41:43.783 --> 01:41:48.585]  Because if you don't do that, you're going to find yourself the same way John Kerry found himself.
[01:41:49.746 --> 01:41:54.268]  And that's why he lost, because he stood on the fence, never committed himself to very many things.
[01:41:55.606 --> 01:41:56.807]  Well, he was a dead ringer.
[01:41:56.827 --> 01:41:59.388]  It's called the best of two evils.
[01:42:01.069 --> 01:42:02.009]  Well, he was a dead ringer.
[01:42:02.069 --> 01:42:09.793]  I mean, he was a fall guy, cousin of Bush, same secret society, which was founded by the East India Company that had the opium monopoly.
[01:42:10.013 --> 01:42:10.433]  Exactly.
[01:42:10.453 --> 01:42:15.696]  I mean, it's the same people, same boss, same as the old boss, meet the new boss, won't get fooled again.
[01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:19.077]  Bill and Toronto, finish up real fast, and then I'll go to all the other callers.
[01:42:21.058 --> 01:42:21.859]  I think Bill's gone.
[01:42:22.399 --> 01:42:23.980]  Okay, well, we're having phone system problems.
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:24.720]  Who's up next, then?
[01:42:27.395 --> 01:42:28.296]  Ribbon in Ohio.
[01:42:28.356 --> 01:42:28.837]  Go ahead.
[01:42:28.897 --> 01:42:29.258]  Welcome.
[01:42:30.900 --> 01:42:35.647]  Alex, maybe I read one too many David Icke books, but I always thought Deep Throat was Henry Kissinger.
[01:42:37.333 --> 01:42:45.338]  But since you have this great guest that's blowing my mind with all these things I can hardly even believe, let me ask you... He's got the documents.
[01:42:46.139 --> 01:42:47.940]  Oh, I can't wait to check out his website.
[01:42:48.180 --> 01:42:50.761]  Is it going to be linked up to Infowars.com by any chance?
[01:42:50.821 --> 01:42:55.184]  It's powderburns.org, and Infowars has got a link to it right now, or at least I told my people to.
[01:42:55.604 --> 01:42:57.145]  As soon as I get off the phone, I'm there.
[01:42:57.426 --> 01:43:02.469]  But listen, I want to ask you, are either of you familiar with a guy named Theodore Shackley?
[01:43:02.529 --> 01:43:03.649]  Is he still alive?
[01:43:03.689 --> 01:43:06.071]  Is he involved today?
[01:43:06.091 --> 01:43:06.131]  No.
[01:43:07.254 --> 01:43:09.035]  Shackley passed away a couple of years ago.
[01:43:09.875 --> 01:43:15.158]  He was head of the Latin American CIA Ops and the Miami Ops.
[01:43:15.678 --> 01:43:20.761]  Felix Rodriguez worked for him for many years back in the 60s and 70s.
[01:43:21.401 --> 01:43:28.725]  They started Operation Mongoose to go out and assassinate Fidel Castro.
[01:43:28.945 --> 01:43:30.826]  He passed away a couple of years ago.
[01:43:31.706 --> 01:43:34.567]  Do you have any stories with Bush Sr.? ?
[01:43:36.010 --> 01:43:38.112]  Governor Clinton drug running together.
[01:43:38.372 --> 01:43:40.635]  Well, the only thing we got on Bush Sr.
[01:43:40.755 --> 01:43:45.199]  is the Iran-Contra stuff that he was involved with in Central America.
[01:43:45.219 --> 01:43:56.130]  And, of course, at that time period that they were training the Contras in Mena, Arkansas, you know, Clinton was governor of that state.
[01:43:56.290 --> 01:43:59.974]  So, you know, there's an old saying, people that live in glass houses shouldn't throw rocks.
[01:44:00.732 --> 01:44:02.974]  And that's why it never happened.
[01:44:03.494 --> 01:44:08.778]  You know, when Clinton won, he never went after the Bushes because it would be like going after himself.
[01:44:09.418 --> 01:44:14.282]  Well, now he vacations with them and is, quote, a surrogate member of the family.
[01:44:14.342 --> 01:44:16.664]  And I've talked to Terry Reid and others that were there on the ground.
[01:44:17.144 --> 01:44:19.446]  No question Bill Clinton was working for the Bushes.
[01:44:19.806 --> 01:44:22.688]  No question Bill Clinton wasn't just getting money from the cocaine.
[01:44:22.928 --> 01:44:24.029]  He was imbibing in it.
[01:44:24.594 --> 01:44:25.054]  Exactly.
[01:44:25.255 --> 01:44:27.116]  A lot of innocent people got hurt behind that.
[01:44:27.336 --> 01:44:30.098]  Well, if kids saw them doing drug drops, they'd just kill them.
[01:44:30.398 --> 01:44:30.919]  Exactly.
[01:44:31.359 --> 01:44:34.722]  And people would shoot themselves twice in the back of the head and be ruled a suicide.
[01:44:35.022 --> 01:44:35.182]  Why?
[01:44:35.242 --> 01:44:37.264]  Being shot in the head twice is quite normal.
[01:44:37.544 --> 01:44:37.844]  Yeah.
[01:44:38.404 --> 01:44:39.325]  Everyone can do it.
[01:44:40.106 --> 01:44:42.728]  Everyone can sprout wings and fly to the moon, too.
[01:44:43.848 --> 01:44:44.389]  Go ahead, Ruben.
[01:44:45.129 --> 01:44:45.490]  That's it.
[01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:46.390]  Thank you, and God bless.
[01:44:46.610 --> 01:44:47.011]  Thank you, sir.
[01:44:47.251 --> 01:44:47.791]  All right, Ruben.
[01:44:47.811 --> 01:44:48.252]  Thank you.
[01:44:48.332 --> 01:44:49.212]  Wes in Tennessee.
[01:44:49.272 --> 01:44:49.953]  Wes, go ahead.
[01:44:50.994 --> 01:44:51.294]  Hi.
[01:44:51.354 --> 01:44:52.195]  How are you, gentlemen?
[01:44:52.415 --> 01:44:52.595]  Good.
[01:44:52.615 --> 01:44:52.915]  Good, sir.
[01:44:53.676 --> 01:44:53.776]  Um...
[01:44:54.674 --> 01:45:00.539]  I don't doubt for a second the veracity of the statements you've made about the border guards.
[01:45:00.639 --> 01:45:05.864]  I know it to be a fact from a friend of mine that owns a ranch on the Arizona border.
[01:45:07.305 --> 01:45:08.306]  What I'm wondering is this.
[01:45:09.367 --> 01:45:19.416]  Don't you have to be absolutely stark braving crazy to take a job where people are going to use you for target practice?
[01:45:21.236 --> 01:45:28.927]  I mean, I just don't understand why they... Let me give you the answer to that, and then I'll let Sully comment, and then get your final take on it, and we'll take some more calls.
[01:45:29.487 --> 01:45:32.812]  Wes, these are good men and women who really love this country.
[01:45:33.479 --> 01:45:35.060]  And it's also a good job for people.
[01:45:35.120 --> 01:45:37.082]  There's not a lot of opportunities in this country anymore.
[01:45:37.502 --> 01:45:44.127]  The first thing they did was offer air marshals $24,000 more than Border Patrol, over $2,000 left to be air marshals.
[01:45:44.147 --> 01:45:45.909]  We had $2,000 less on the southern border.
[01:45:46.389 --> 01:45:50.733]  Then when Homeland Security got funding for that, Bush nixed it and took that funding for something else.
[01:45:51.153 --> 01:45:52.394]  They have them picking up trash.
[01:45:52.814 --> 01:45:53.194]  We're good to go.
[01:46:17.533 --> 01:46:17.853]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:17.913 --> 01:46:19.054]  I totally agree with you on that.
[01:46:19.374 --> 01:46:20.254]  That's why we do have good people.
[01:46:35.419 --> 01:46:36.279]  We are losing.
[01:46:36.339 --> 01:46:39.322]  They just approved for 2,000 employees for the U.S.
[01:46:39.362 --> 01:46:41.523]  Border Patrol, which are not going to be filled.
[01:46:41.984 --> 01:46:45.907]  And the kids that are going to fill it are not going to stay there.
[01:46:46.387 --> 01:46:51.051]  The majority of the Border Patrol guys, they leave the agency within the third year.
[01:46:52.479 --> 01:46:54.060]  They're just unhappy with it.
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:55.942]  They're chasing their tail.
[01:46:56.022 --> 01:46:58.883]  It's never going to happen.
[01:46:59.104 --> 01:47:03.546]  It's an enforcement branch of the government that has never worked and will never work.
[01:47:03.947 --> 01:47:06.468]  Well, I've been told by high-level people it's designed to fail.
[01:47:07.049 --> 01:47:07.269]  Yes.
[01:47:09.390 --> 01:47:10.031]  Go ahead, Wes.
[01:47:10.391 --> 01:47:18.216]  Alex, for any of the audience that has any doubt, there isn't a product you can buy today.
[01:47:19.278 --> 01:47:25.020]  It does not have its instructions written in French, Spanish, and English.
[01:47:26.241 --> 01:47:32.063]  It's three languages of Canada, United States, and Mexico.
[01:47:32.083 --> 01:47:34.684]  And it's no accident that there are three languages.
[01:47:34.724 --> 01:47:37.905]  Well, I mean, Reuters just came out and said Pan American Union.
[01:47:38.785 --> 01:47:39.905]  Folks, this isn't a joke.
[01:47:40.826 --> 01:47:41.406]  It's for real.
[01:47:42.086 --> 01:47:43.307]  It is absolutely for real.
[01:47:44.087 --> 01:47:44.747]  One last thing.
[01:47:45.367 --> 01:47:46.708]  I'm kind of wondering when...
[01:47:47.625 --> 01:47:50.568]  Some of the landowners in Arizona are going to start shooting back.
[01:47:52.610 --> 01:47:54.913]  Well, the feds have said they'll be arrested if they do.
[01:47:55.173 --> 01:47:57.015]  And again, it's been in the news.
[01:47:57.115 --> 01:47:59.297]  The Border Patrol has been ordered to not return fire.
[01:47:59.738 --> 01:48:01.480]  Sully, I mean, how insane is that?
[01:48:01.900 --> 01:48:05.043]  When the Los Zetas and people fire at them, they're ordered to not fire back?
[01:48:05.444 --> 01:48:06.845]  Well, just listen to this.
[01:48:08.982 --> 01:48:15.784]  The people across the river here in South Texas, they got nothing but AK-47s and full automatic weapons across the river.
[01:48:16.684 --> 01:48:24.207]  Our Border Patrol guys up here got maybe a semi or a handgun, and you can't compete that.
[01:48:24.287 --> 01:48:27.948]  Once they start shooting, there's going to be a problem.
[01:48:28.468 --> 01:48:34.570]  By the way, our local police have all got big armored vehicles and the latest stuff, but, oh, we can't give that to the Border Patrol.
[01:48:35.413 --> 01:48:35.934]  Absolutely.
[01:48:35.954 --> 01:48:52.347]  You know, and the other thing, you know, those SETA guys got those surface-to-air missiles, those SAM missiles that they used to use down in the Civil War of Iran-Contra down in Central America, and Nicaragua just lost 100 missiles that came into the U.S.
[01:48:53.624 --> 01:49:06.177]  So you know darn well that the drug traffickers, the cartels, have those, and they will use them to bring down those helicopters, whether it's Border Patrol or government agency helicopters.
[01:49:06.197 --> 01:49:13.844]  You know, guys that fly helicopters feel so secure, but I'm telling you, there's approximately 100 missiles that left Nicaragua.
[01:49:14.845 --> 01:49:17.368]  They're coming in into Mexico and the U.S.
[01:49:19.492 --> 01:49:20.553]  Unbelievable.
[01:49:21.034 --> 01:49:22.115]  And the globalists will love it.
[01:49:22.135 --> 01:49:24.077]  They'll just get to start up an even bigger police state.
[01:49:24.117 --> 01:49:24.938]  Wes, thanks for the call.
[01:49:25.078 --> 01:49:25.438]  Thank you.
[01:49:25.698 --> 01:49:29.983]  We may have time to cram a few in on this final segment that we're accelerating towards.
[01:49:30.864 --> 01:49:32.145]  Shelly, what's your prognosis?
[01:49:32.165 --> 01:49:33.746]  Do you think America's going to survive?
[01:49:35.288 --> 01:49:36.149]  Absolutely not.
[01:49:36.169 --> 01:49:41.554]  The only way that the United States government will survive, this country will survive, is if there's a revolution.
[01:49:42.475 --> 01:49:43.156]  That's the only way.
[01:49:45.583 --> 01:49:47.349]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:47.430 --> 01:49:49.276]  Criminality run rampant.
[01:49:49.958 --> 01:49:51.022]  Total bedlam.
[01:49:51.363 --> 01:49:51.824]  Anarchy.
[01:49:53.490 --> 01:50:00.317]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.658 --> 01:50:02.019]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.219 --> 01:50:04.422]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.582 --> 01:50:06.664]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.944 --> 01:50:11.869]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.210 --> 01:50:16.254]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.

[01:50:17.374 --> 01:50:18.474]  We're good to go.

[01:51:52.173 --> 01:51:55.556]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:51:55.796 --> 01:51:56.116]  Why?
[01:51:56.136 --> 01:51:59.078]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of Cardivite?

[01:53:04.628 --> 01:53:05.328]  I know it's mine.
[01:53:05.368 --> 01:53:06.288]  I hope you'll adopt it.
[01:53:06.308 --> 01:53:08.409]  You can't back down.
[01:53:09.089 --> 01:53:11.290]  Think about committing our future generations to this.
[01:53:12.471 --> 01:53:14.071]  You won't have to wait for future generations.
[01:53:14.091 --> 01:53:15.031]  This is happening now.
[01:53:15.592 --> 01:53:16.872]  They're debasing the dollar.
[01:53:16.892 --> 01:53:17.772]  They're scamming us.
[01:53:18.032 --> 01:53:19.593]  Three trillion's missing from the Pentagon.
[01:53:20.610 --> 01:53:27.194]  Mr. Galloway, a member of Parliament who exposed him as a bunch of criminals before the Senate a few weeks ago, was on with us yesterday.
[01:53:27.214 --> 01:53:31.917]  And I brought up government-sponsored terror as a pretext to invade Iran.
[01:53:31.957 --> 01:53:34.659]  The government carrying out an attack and blaming it on Iran.
[01:53:34.959 --> 01:53:42.323]  Here's 57 seconds of the end of that interview, and we'll get Selly's comment on it, then we'll talk to Fred in Pennsylvania and wrap up this transmission.
[01:53:42.583 --> 01:53:43.184]  But here it is.
[01:53:43.744 --> 01:53:44.504]  I have another article.
[01:53:44.725 --> 01:53:47.406]  RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war.
[01:53:47.446 --> 01:53:51.188]  Times of London, they may try to goad Iran into doing something.
[01:53:51.548 --> 01:53:55.390]  Yes, but people are not fools in these countries.
[01:53:55.490 --> 01:54:04.575]  They have their own sophisticated political class, and they know that Bush and Blair are too weak at the moment to launch any new wars.
[01:54:05.055 --> 01:54:06.796]  But we must keep them weak.
[01:54:07.356 --> 01:54:08.997]  If we let them recover their strength,
[01:54:09.677 --> 01:54:14.518]  If we let them off the hook, then they may well decide to start yet another war.
[01:54:14.538 --> 01:54:15.099]  We've got 30 seconds.
[01:54:15.279 --> 01:54:19.420]  What do we do if the military-industrial complex carries out a terror attack, deployment on them?
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:23.021]  Well, that's another very real danger.
[01:54:23.101 --> 01:54:29.062]  There's no way that we can legislate for that, but we must be on guard.
[01:54:29.082 --> 01:54:31.203]  We need a vigilant citizenry.
[01:54:31.623 --> 01:54:32.283]  Unbelievable.
[01:54:32.563 --> 01:54:37.725]  We need a vigilant citizenry that's alive to all the tricks that these monkeys are up to.
[01:54:37.745 --> 01:54:38.545]  I salute you.
[01:54:39.045 --> 01:54:39.746]  Thank you very much.
[01:55:02.277 --> 01:55:08.039]  They realize that the American government is business as usual when it comes to that.
[01:55:08.799 --> 01:55:11.660]  Those people who live in those third world countries know.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:17.502]  Guatemala, Salvador, Colombia, they all realize what the U.S.
[01:55:17.522 --> 01:55:18.343]  government is doing.
[01:55:19.563 --> 01:55:22.824]  The problem is that they've been blackmailed to cooperate with the U.S.
[01:55:22.864 --> 01:55:26.385]  government, or else they lose the millions of dollars that they've made.
[01:55:26.525 --> 01:55:27.205]  And the U.S.
[01:55:27.285 --> 01:55:28.965]  government is not America.
[01:55:29.046 --> 01:55:31.286]  We don't owe fealty to the U.S.
[01:55:31.346 --> 01:55:31.786]  government.
[01:55:32.026 --> 01:55:35.707]  We owe it to what this country is, the Bill of Rights, which they are destroying.
[01:55:35.867 --> 01:55:36.367]  Exactly.
[01:55:36.407 --> 01:55:39.568]  They have spit on the Constitution.
[01:55:39.608 --> 01:55:41.169]  They stepped on the civil rights.
[01:55:43.249 --> 01:55:43.929]  It's terrible.
[01:55:44.029 --> 01:55:46.170]  And the American people...
[01:55:47.172 --> 01:55:49.513]  Allowing this to happen.
[01:55:50.733 --> 01:55:55.234]  And that's what we need to educate the American people and stop being ignorant.
[01:55:55.835 --> 01:55:58.956]  Educate themselves in what is really going on.
[01:55:58.976 --> 01:56:00.796]  Because people don't believe this.
[01:56:00.876 --> 01:56:03.117]  People say, well, you know, there's an excuse for it.
[01:56:03.697 --> 01:56:08.358]  There's probably something that they have to do covertly and so forth and this and that.
[01:56:08.558 --> 01:56:10.479]  Like people were trying to say to me,
[01:56:11.019 --> 01:56:19.766]  Well, you know, why were you not protesting when those 300,000 people were killed in the 80s in Central America by our death squads that we trained?
[01:56:19.786 --> 01:56:21.948]  He says, well, those were casualties of war.
[01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:25.391]  Let's let Fred in Pennsylvania take us out of the broadcast.
[01:56:25.411 --> 01:56:26.052]  Fred, go ahead.
[01:56:26.512 --> 01:56:27.653]  Okay.
[01:56:28.373 --> 01:56:35.019]  I had heard that in the first Bush administration that Mexico was
[01:56:35.789 --> 01:56:37.449]  No, they want cheap labor, Sally.
[01:56:37.830 --> 01:56:39.970]  Absolutely, they want cheap labor.
[01:56:40.050 --> 01:56:48.252]  I mean, you know, one of the answers to stop the immigration flow is to economically help those ten poorest states in Mexico.
[01:56:48.272 --> 01:56:49.973]  They're forcing the peasants off their land.
[01:56:50.053 --> 01:56:50.313]  Exactly.
[01:57:03.896 --> 01:57:06.157]  So that's the problem that we foresee on that.
[01:57:06.297 --> 01:57:07.958]  The government's putting the pressure down there.
[01:57:08.338 --> 01:57:08.858]  Exactly.
[01:57:09.078 --> 01:57:09.959]  All right, thank you, Fred.
[01:57:10.239 --> 01:57:12.319]  Selle Castillo, powderburns.org.
[01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:14.120]  I salute you, my friend.
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:19.342]  I really appreciate your honorable job you've done defending America, and I consider you a brother.
[01:57:19.822 --> 01:57:20.323]  Thank you, brother.
[01:57:20.783 --> 01:57:21.723]  All right, take care, Selle.
[01:57:21.743 --> 01:57:21.923]  Bye-bye.
[01:57:22.403 --> 01:57:23.864]  Go to powderburns.org.
[01:57:24.344 --> 01:57:24.824]  Great guy.
[01:57:24.864 --> 01:57:25.325]  Get his book.
[01:57:25.865 --> 01:57:30.046]  I'll see you this Friday at the Alamo Draft House downtown for the 7 and 10 p.m.
[01:57:30.066 --> 01:57:31.187]  showing of Martial Law.
[01:57:31.868 --> 01:57:34.772]  And I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, and back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[01:57:35.113 --> 01:57:37.036]  Now get out there and take on the New World Order.
[01:57:37.477 --> 01:57:38.839]  God bless you all.
[01:57:49.984 --> 01:57:50.604]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.285 --> 01:57:52.305]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.045 --> 01:57:54.146]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.826 --> 01:57:55.647]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.387 --> 01:57:57.287]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.948 --> 01:58:01.609]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.129 --> 01:58:06.271]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:15.175 --> 01:58:16.836]  Well, it feels like a Monday.
[01:58:18.524 --> 01:58:22.508]  But as you know well, it is Tuesday, the day after Memorial Day.
[01:58:23.749 --> 01:58:24.669]  May 31st, 2005.
[01:58:24.749 --> 01:58:32.016]  We'll be live for the next 2 hours and 59 minutes, 15 seconds.
[01:58:33.837 --> 01:58:35.519]  And he's scheduled to come on.
[01:58:35.539 --> 01:58:38.381]  Been working on this for several weeks.
[01:58:39.482 --> 01:58:45.107]  In 30 minutes, George Galloway, the head of the Respect Party, the member of Parliament, who...
[01:58:46.169 --> 01:59:00.522]  Grabbed victory from the jaws of defeat and exposed the neocons as a bunch of forging criminal liars when it came to the Iraq oil for food program which they themselves were scamming, not Mr. Galloway or his party.
[01:59:01.924 --> 01:59:09.030]  So we're scheduled to have that in about 30 minutes and I want to play a few minutes of his speech before Mr. Galloway joins us.
[01:59:09.070 --> 01:59:09.811]  That's been posted.
[01:59:10.336 --> 01:59:19.203]  Of course, for about three or four weeks on Infowars.com and on PrisonPlanet.com so you can't miss it there on the site.
[01:59:19.964 --> 01:59:25.908]  In the third hour, we have the head of the Canadian Hemophiliac Society coming on.
[01:59:26.008 --> 01:59:29.952]  Big BBC report admitting that the Red Cross knowingly was...
[01:59:30.735 --> 01:59:40.719]  Trafficking in blood, infected with HIV, hepatitis A, B, and C, and many other horrible pathogens, viruses, bacteria, you name it.
[01:59:40.799 --> 01:59:51.924]  And this goes back to the Hemophiliac Society when Bill Clinton was still in office being robbed, being raided the same night that the doctor in Little Rock had exposed
[01:59:52.684 --> 01:59:57.848]  Them taking the blood from the prisoners that they knew had HIV and hepatitis and selling it.
[01:59:57.948 --> 02:00:08.636]  He got firebombed the same night the Hemophiliac Society got robbed all the files and computers that had anything in them to do with the blood case.
[02:00:13.279 --> 02:00:15.341]  So that's coming up in the third hour.
[02:00:15.421 --> 02:00:18.623]  Just to show you the mindset of these people.
[02:00:19.704 --> 02:00:20.725]  What we're dealing with.
[02:00:21.562 --> 02:00:30.666]  How cavalier they are towards spreading death and destruction in a wanton, really relished fashion.
[02:00:31.287 --> 02:00:33.108]  They don't just do it in a cavalier fashion.
[02:00:33.488 --> 02:00:40.451]  They enjoy doing it while posing and telling you what saviors they are for you and your family.
[02:00:40.531 --> 02:00:42.292]  It's thoroughly disgusting.
[02:00:43.317 --> 02:00:47.138]  Coming up, French non-vote puts EU in turmoil.
[02:00:47.158 --> 02:00:49.878]  We reported last week that polls showed they would fail.
[02:00:50.319 --> 02:01:01.881]  They did fail, but the EU says they're just going to go ahead and enforce their arbitrary centralized system without the yes vote for merging the EU's power in France.
[02:01:01.961 --> 02:01:05.382]  The Netherlands is set to begin pulling out of the EU.
[02:01:06.772 --> 02:01:11.093]  This has really got the globalists panicking and very, very upset.
[02:01:11.613 --> 02:01:22.936]  French voters clear no to the EU Constitution has left European leaders struggling to define the way forward.
[02:01:23.076 --> 02:01:23.456]  Yes.
[02:01:24.956 --> 02:01:26.796]  Again, I already mentioned this, but here's the headline.
[02:01:27.276 --> 02:01:31.397]  Canadian Red Cross use HIV blood knowingly.
[02:01:31.957 --> 02:01:34.518]  Iraq bombers hit security forces.
[02:01:35.650 --> 02:01:42.536]  RAF bombing raids tried to goad, that is push, Saddam Hussein into war.
[02:01:42.556 --> 02:01:46.539]  RFID chips injected into Barcelona ravers.
[02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:51.083]  More news on this coming out as the microchipping spreads.
[02:01:52.544 --> 02:02:01.612]  The perils of smoking are discussed at a World No Tobacco Day as they push for a world tax against tobacco products.
[02:02:02.665 --> 02:02:03.045]  The U.S.
[02:02:03.065 --> 02:02:07.128]  may ask for Canadian domestic passport list, expanding that database.
[02:02:07.148 --> 02:02:14.813]  There's just masses and masses of news coming up after this quick break.
[02:02:14.913 --> 02:02:18.095]  And, of course, more phone calls today at 1-800-259-9231.

[02:02:49.745 --> 02:02:51.046]  Alex Jones here, America.

[02:04:45.882 --> 02:04:51.424]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[02:04:51.544 --> 02:04:52.625]  You wear deodorant, right?
[02:04:52.725 --> 02:04:53.605]  Well, let's hope you do.
[02:04:53.725 --> 02:04:56.546]  You obviously wear it to cover up that embarrassing underarm odor.
[02:04:56.746 --> 02:05:01.628]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[02:05:01.868 --> 02:05:02.949]  Check out this new product.
[02:05:03.109 --> 02:05:05.990]  It's called No-B-O and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[02:05:06.370 --> 02:05:10.092]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust No-B-O to eliminate your embarrassing body odor?
[02:05:10.212 --> 02:05:10.412]  Look.
[02:05:10.592 --> 02:05:12.814]  The creator of Nobio understands what you're going through.

[02:05:21.343 --> 02:05:26.749]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[02:05:26.849 --> 02:05:27.610]  Try Nobio.
[02:05:27.730 --> 02:05:28.711]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[02:05:29.872 --> 02:05:30.292]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.241 --> 02:05:52.282]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.002 --> 02:05:54.123]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:54.783 --> 02:05:55.623]  You want answers?
[02:05:55.643 --> 02:05:57.224]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.925 --> 02:06:01.587]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.087 --> 02:06:06.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:12.352 --> 02:06:18.636]  Well, the last six months, you've had the number three man at the CIA, Buzzy Crongart, tell the Times of London...
[02:06:20.083 --> 02:06:26.727]  That he's not concerned about capturing bin Laden, that capturing bin Laden would be very dangerous and would help Al-Qaeda.
[02:06:27.707 --> 02:06:29.588]  We know bin Laden is CIA.
[02:06:30.349 --> 02:06:35.411]  We know what FBI agent Robert Wright and Larry Klayman and others told us at the National Press Club three years ago.
[02:06:35.992 --> 02:06:38.933]  We've been ordered under national security to not tell you what we know.
[02:06:38.953 --> 02:06:47.078]  All we can say is, here is the letter threatening to arrest us, and we can tell you the Bushes' vacation with the bin Ladens.
[02:06:48.127 --> 02:06:54.750]  That's Larry Klayman with Robert Wright, a big 6'4 man, crying because he wanted to protect this country.
[02:06:55.470 --> 02:07:00.452]  So blown away that he was being threatened with arrest that day if he told you what he knows.
[02:07:00.492 --> 02:07:07.895]  Well, we know what he knows, and David Shippers had told us most of it months before that when he came on this broadcast a week after 9-11.
[02:07:10.276 --> 02:07:12.798]  But you see how I get off the beaten path here.
[02:07:13.659 --> 02:07:16.481]  The bottom line is the government protects al-Qaeda.
[02:07:16.561 --> 02:07:20.604]  Al-Qaeda is the pretext they need to scare us into submission.
[02:07:21.164 --> 02:07:30.632]  Usually when they bust an al-Qaeda member, it turns out that it was some innocent person, or they were CIA'd, and they were staging their arrest to, quote, protect their identity.
[02:07:32.873 --> 02:07:35.936]  And then they'll still use that person's name years later.
[02:07:36.436 --> 02:07:39.979]  Oh, this top al-Qaeda person's out killing people, or we just killed him.
[02:07:40.891 --> 02:07:45.793]  Well, wait, I have an article from three years ago, two years ago, where you say he was CIA and you were protecting him.
[02:07:45.813 --> 02:07:48.693]  I mean, that's how in your face they are.
[02:07:49.754 --> 02:08:05.059]  There were several big British newspapers, very prestigious and respected, that reported that months before 9-11, and this was before 9-11, they reported that British diplomats were in Pakistan on the Afghan border and that bin Laden was there being guarded by U.S.
[02:08:05.079 --> 02:08:05.979]  special forces.
[02:08:07.239 --> 02:08:08.460]  I mean, that was before 9-11, and then...
[02:08:10.951 --> 02:08:27.079]  Months after 9-11 with the takeover of Afghanistan, it turns out that they just arrested the conscripts that were in the front lines, and our government did, and that the Arab fighters behind them in the lines were loaded onto helicopters and C-130s by the U.S.
[02:08:27.139 --> 02:08:30.260]  government and flown out to safety in Afghanistan.
[02:08:31.181 --> 02:08:33.182]  They were CIA assets.
[02:08:35.265 --> 02:08:38.247]  And then Bush, remember for two years, he said, we're going to get bin Laden.
[02:08:38.307 --> 02:08:40.389]  Number one job, kill bin Laden.
[02:08:40.409 --> 02:08:41.309]  We're going to get bin Laden.
[02:08:41.349 --> 02:08:46.473]  And then they were getting ready to invade Iraq, and they said, don't worry about bin Laden anymore.
[02:08:46.533 --> 02:08:48.375]  The focus is Saddam, and he did it.
[02:08:48.935 --> 02:08:52.157]  And then now it's turned into Bush saying, hey, I'm not worried about bin Laden.
[02:08:52.197 --> 02:08:53.258]  I don't care where he is.
[02:08:53.578 --> 02:08:54.539]  We're not after him.
[02:08:54.859 --> 02:08:55.620]  We have those clips.
[02:08:55.640 --> 02:08:56.140]  We played them.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:57.741]  You've probably seen them on TV.
[02:08:58.001 --> 02:09:00.623]  Then later Bush said, I never said we didn't want to capture bin Laden.
[02:09:01.444 --> 02:09:02.485]  That's an urban legend.
[02:09:02.525 --> 02:09:04.146]  And then they play the clip of Bush saying it.
[02:09:04.651 --> 02:09:09.652]  I've had a lot of fun with that on the Jon Stewart Show there on Comedy Central.
[02:09:11.152 --> 02:09:12.133]  Not the Jon Stewart Show.
[02:09:12.193 --> 02:09:14.713]  It's the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.
[02:09:15.593 --> 02:09:16.754]  Mesopotamia.
[02:09:18.354 --> 02:09:21.835]  But all of that with this backdrop, U.S.
[02:09:21.855 --> 02:09:24.415]  to widen focus against extremism.
[02:09:25.815 --> 02:09:30.676]  This is the Major Milderberg Group paper, and we've got internal sources telling us they want to go after patriots.
[02:09:31.517 --> 02:09:33.577]  They're very angry with patriots in America.
[02:09:34.561 --> 02:09:51.287]  The Bush administration has launched a high-level review of its efforts to battle terrorism and aimed at moving away from a policy that has stressed efforts to capture or kill some of bin Laden and al-Qaeda leaders and towards what an official called a broader strategy against violent extremism.
[02:09:52.087 --> 02:09:53.388]  And guess who's in here?
[02:09:53.428 --> 02:09:57.849]  Not just the Muslims, but those evil Christian conservatives, those evil patriots.
[02:09:58.309 --> 02:10:00.390]  Why, they're probably working with bin Laden.
[02:10:00.450 --> 02:10:02.991]  And so, by fighting extremism, which...
[02:10:03.826 --> 02:10:06.327]  I've been called an extremist for talking about the Bilderberg Group.
[02:10:07.648 --> 02:10:08.549]  The world government.
[02:10:08.569 --> 02:10:09.749]  You know, you're an evil terrorist.
[02:10:10.049 --> 02:10:11.810]  So we see them widening that.
[02:10:12.971 --> 02:10:13.851]  Another headline here.
[02:10:13.891 --> 02:10:14.992]  Troops on the border.
[02:10:15.052 --> 02:10:18.874]  Minutemen project showed how effective eyes can be on the border.
[02:10:20.395 --> 02:10:27.098]  From cakewalk to bloodbath, Bush opts for civil war in Iraq as things get more and more serious.
[02:10:27.639 --> 02:10:32.081]  Now we're learning that the RAF, the Royal Air Force in England, bombed
[02:10:33.181 --> 02:10:38.287]  Iraq, for years, trying to get Saddam to launch an attack on someone, which he never did.
[02:10:40.310 --> 02:10:44.515]  So, there they are, trying to manufacture terrorism yet again.
[02:10:44.535 --> 02:10:48.759]  And there's another one, New York Times, trying to thwart possible terrorists quickly.
[02:10:49.200 --> 02:10:51.703]  FBI agents are often playing terrorists.
[02:10:52.395 --> 02:10:53.235]  Laying them, yes.
[02:10:53.495 --> 02:10:57.657]  And when they get caught carrying out terror attacks, oh no, it was just a sting gone bad.
[02:10:58.037 --> 02:11:00.078]  That's why we're funding and training all the terrorists.
[02:11:00.758 --> 02:11:03.159]  Oh no, we were just trying to stop them.
[02:11:03.779 --> 02:11:07.540]  And a really scary article here, documented proof of Stasi-like recruitment.
[02:11:07.920 --> 02:11:10.201]  We've got one of these letters going out around the U.S.
[02:11:10.301 --> 02:11:17.663]  and England, getting neighbors to be tattletales, and now all crime is terrorism, so it says, fight the terrorists, tattle on your neighbor.
[02:11:18.063 --> 02:11:19.504]  Are they smoking marijuana?
[02:11:21.385 --> 02:11:23.887]  This is the type of news I have here in front of me.
[02:11:24.488 --> 02:11:25.488]  I hope he's coming on.
[02:11:25.549 --> 02:11:28.691]  I mean, it's a big catch and we're going to be honored to have him.
[02:11:30.052 --> 02:11:45.065]  George Galloway, the Member of Parliament who turned the tables on the neocons in the Senate and their slanderous, larcenous attacks on him, is scheduled to be joining us in about 15, 16 minutes, so don't want to miss that.
[02:11:46.861 --> 02:11:53.462]  And coming up later, the government and others knowingly making sure that HIV and hepatitis blood went out to millions of people.
[02:11:54.062 --> 02:12:06.144]  More and more documents in hindsight coming out documenting what this audience already knew, but we're going to have the head of the Canadian Hemophiliac Society on the broadcast to discuss it.
[02:12:07.425 --> 02:12:08.705]  There is some good news.
[02:12:08.925 --> 02:12:14.746]  National ID cards, they've tried to pass them for the sixth time in England in the last decade and failed.
[02:12:15.802 --> 02:12:22.726]  They don't have those special electronic voting machines, and as soon as they get those, everyone will love what's happening, just like we do here now.
[02:12:23.606 --> 02:12:30.430]  But it doesn't matter if 90% of us are going to get something in a poll, 90-plus percent, magically the machines always come through.
[02:12:30.450 --> 02:12:38.455]  In areas where the machines aren't in, magically the government's programs fail, but magically where they do have the machines, they get everything they want.
[02:12:39.562 --> 02:12:43.564]  But it's on the rocks there, and the government's still trying to pass it.
[02:12:43.645 --> 02:12:46.746]  Yet again, when you first don't succeed, try, try again.
[02:12:46.766 --> 02:12:48.047]  We've got to have that same attitude.
[02:12:49.388 --> 02:12:54.351]  When it comes to defending liberty and freedom, French non puts EU in turmoil.
[02:12:54.411 --> 02:13:01.695]  French voters clear no to the EU Constitution as left European leaders struggling to define the way forward.
[02:13:02.076 --> 02:13:07.339]  European Commission President José Manuel Barsaro said there was...
[02:13:08.098 --> 02:13:14.182]  Now, a very serious problem, that's the quote, and there was no willingness to reopen negotiations.
[02:13:15.023 --> 02:13:20.667]  In the French referendum, almost 55% of people voted no, with 45% in favor.
[02:13:20.707 --> 02:13:22.448]  Turnout was high, almost 70%.
[02:13:24.169 --> 02:13:30.253]  Wish we could get 70% turnout here, but people instinctively know most elections are now frauds.
[02:13:30.433 --> 02:13:31.734]  Sorry to have to report that to you.
[02:13:33.020 --> 02:13:36.342]  In a severe, perhaps fatal blow, I love it.
[02:13:36.542 --> 02:13:37.923]  Dance on that grave.
[02:13:38.823 --> 02:13:41.045]  This sucker is a body snatcher, an undead.
[02:13:41.065 --> 02:13:41.985]  It doesn't die.
[02:13:42.025 --> 02:13:43.086]  We've got to keep fighting it.
[02:13:43.206 --> 02:13:47.008]  We've got to cut it up in little pieces and scatter it to the four winds.
[02:13:47.708 --> 02:13:53.851]  It is a severe, perhaps fatal blow to the EU Constitution, which needs to be ratified by all 25 member states.
[02:13:55.399 --> 02:14:06.610]  French President Jacques Chirac accepted the vote's sovereign decision on Sunday, but said it created a difficult context for the difference of our interest in Europe.
[02:14:07.251 --> 02:14:10.254]  He has campaigned hard for a yes vote.
[02:14:11.615 --> 02:14:19.763]  The next big test comes in the Netherlands on Wednesday when the Dutch vote in a referendum, and the no camp has a clear lead in opinion polls.
[02:14:20.755 --> 02:14:33.864]  UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, who lost most of the seats for his party, but is still in office, whose government will take over the EU presidency on July 1st, called for a time of reflection.
[02:14:34.324 --> 02:14:39.608]  France's rejection of the Constitution raised profound questions about Europe's future, he said.
[02:14:40.108 --> 02:14:41.189]  Winners and losers.
[02:14:41.229 --> 02:14:46.792]  The BBC's world affairs analyst, Paul Reynolds, says there is no plan B for the EU, no clear way forward.
[02:14:47.113 --> 02:14:50.555]  Funny, I'm reading here where they're saying they're just going to start implementing the bureaucracy.
[02:14:50.555 --> 02:14:51.395]  We're good to go.
[02:14:51.415 --> 02:14:51.896]  We're good to go.
[02:15:20.140 --> 02:15:25.961]  No, they would put themselves under paralysis of advocating giving up all of their freedoms.
[02:15:26.121 --> 02:15:27.701]  And that's what the EU Constitution did.
[02:15:28.142 --> 02:15:33.102]  Basically set up an even greater police fit in Europe where most basic rights have already been torn away.
[02:15:35.083 --> 02:15:46.845]  The President of the European Parliament, José Porel, also put a brave face on the result saying, I think we have to continue asking the other countries and we should not stop the process of ratification.
[02:15:47.848 --> 02:15:51.969]  In his televised addresses, Mr. Sirach said voters had registered their frustrations.
[02:15:52.350 --> 02:15:59.872]  He said he would take the decision on the future of the center-right government in the coming days, hinting at a possible reshuffle.
[02:16:01.013 --> 02:16:01.333]  Yes.
[02:16:01.953 --> 02:16:07.775]  Try to pay off some more of the politicians with a parliamentary power-sharing agreement to get people to go along.
[02:16:08.095 --> 02:16:09.356]  This is wonderful news.
[02:16:09.536 --> 02:16:13.017]  And, again, the National ID cards shot down yet again in England.
[02:16:14.352 --> 02:16:17.853]  The polls are over 80% against it, and the government just keeps trying to pass it.
[02:16:20.233 --> 02:16:21.834]  But here they're more crafty.
[02:16:21.874 --> 02:16:23.574]  They don't call it a national ID card.
[02:16:23.614 --> 02:16:31.816]  They call it a real ID card or a security feature, which actually does nothing to stop illegals and everything to put us all into these huge databases.
[02:16:32.796 --> 02:16:35.157]  So here in America, they don't allow us to vote on it.
[02:16:35.177 --> 02:16:36.297]  They're not honest about it.
[02:16:38.118 --> 02:16:42.339]  And I was on a radio show this morning, and they were going, can we stop the national ID card?
[02:16:42.359 --> 02:16:43.939]  They didn't know it had already been passed.
[02:16:44.562 --> 02:16:45.902]  Two different versions of it.
[02:16:45.922 --> 02:16:54.425]  You know, it's like they laid the foundation in December of last year and then a couple weeks ago passed the building of the entire structure on steroids.
[02:16:56.546 --> 02:16:58.586]  But, again, there's a lot of good news today.
[02:16:59.107 --> 02:17:00.027]  We're in this fight.
[02:17:00.047 --> 02:17:00.867]  We're in this bout.
[02:17:00.887 --> 02:17:02.048]  We've got a chance to win it.
[02:17:02.568 --> 02:17:06.769]  But we've got to have recall elections on paper ballots of the electronic voting machines.
[02:17:06.789 --> 02:17:09.330]  And I keep throwing that idea out there.
[02:17:09.490 --> 02:17:10.270]  That's the key.
[02:17:10.410 --> 02:17:12.811]  A recall of the ballot machines.
[02:17:13.888 --> 02:17:15.449]  We've got to have, or it's over.
[02:17:16.169 --> 02:17:34.619]  Six plus billion dollars that Chuckie Schumer and George Bush wrote up together, Bush administration and Schumer, Hillary spearheaded it, and that six billion bucks in the last four years has been used to put in, it's over 35% now, the country has these machines that are total frauds, and soon it's going to be over.
[02:17:35.960 --> 02:17:37.141]  Unless we stop it now.
[02:17:38.223 --> 02:17:40.704]  There are a bunch of states that are pulling out, and that's exciting.
[02:17:40.744 --> 02:17:41.764]  What, seven states right now?
[02:17:42.304 --> 02:17:42.825]  That's true.
[02:17:42.845 --> 02:17:43.765]  Your state does it, too.
[02:17:43.785 --> 02:17:44.965]  Stay with us.
[02:17:45.766 --> 02:17:52.148]  To the farthest corners of the Earth, explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:17:52.468 --> 02:17:54.809]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.
[02:17:55.029 --> 02:17:56.590]  Achieve financial independence.
[02:17:56.950 --> 02:18:02.031]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a North Star.
[02:18:02.352 --> 02:18:03.572]  Get the Red Book of U.S.
[02:18:03.632 --> 02:18:06.333]  Coins, and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.
[02:18:06.713 --> 02:18:13.757]  Right now, Midas Resources is offering the 2005 edition of the Red Book, along with a silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:14.117 --> 02:18:16.959]  Call them today at 1-800-686-2237.
[02:18:17.599 --> 02:18:17.939]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:18:17.959 --> 02:18:25.784]  I can tell you there will be storms ahead, but with real money as your base, liberty will be your fate.
[02:18:26.284 --> 02:18:31.768]  Leave the fiat currency behind and call Midas Resources to get your red book along with that silver dollar for only $22.95.
[02:18:31.808 --> 02:18:33.829]  Get the map.
[02:18:33.869 --> 02:18:36.251]  Start your journey to financial independence today.
[02:18:36.471 --> 02:18:37.452]  The time is now.
[02:18:37.812 --> 02:18:38.773]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:18:40.714 --> 02:18:43.816]  Get your red book now and you'll weather any storm that comes your way.
[02:18:45.151 --> 02:18:48.433]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:18:48.493 --> 02:18:52.676]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:18:52.916 --> 02:18:55.718]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:18:55.898 --> 02:18:58.320]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:18:58.500 --> 02:19:07.145]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 psi, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:19:07.325 --> 02:19:08.666]  The Berkey Light is different.
[02:19:08.886 --> 02:19:13.029]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:19:13.289 --> 02:19:14.010]  Not yet available?
[02:19:43.289 --> 02:19:48.072]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.792 --> 02:19:54.015]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[02:19:54.875 --> 02:20:01.759]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[02:20:02.819 --> 02:20:11.344]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[02:20:12.346 --> 02:20:12.466]  516-8736.

[02:21:27.939 --> 02:21:29.060]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:29.100 --> 02:21:30.681]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:22:00.638 --> 02:22:14.105]  Later in the broadcast today, next hour, I do want to talk about life and death and how transitory life is and how quickly those we love can be taken from us and how that fits into the equation of standing up against tyranny.
[02:22:15.826 --> 02:22:18.227]  I don't want a bunch of people to call me and say they're sorry for me.
[02:22:18.307 --> 02:22:19.888]  I think it's a lesson to be learned from it.
[02:22:19.928 --> 02:22:28.532]  But my sweet little chihuahua named Conan, little three-pound chihuahua that was a rescue dog
[02:22:29.611 --> 02:22:32.952]  I've been one of these puppy mills, 80-something dogs, been taken away from a lady.
[02:22:33.572 --> 02:22:37.613]  We went and got him when he was like a concentration camp victim about five years ago.
[02:22:38.473 --> 02:22:39.853]  Nursed him back to health.
[02:22:39.873 --> 02:22:44.554]  He'd gotten so spunky, he'd been so fearful and wouldn't come out from under the bed.
[02:22:44.594 --> 02:22:49.095]  He'd gotten to where he'd run around and chase other dogs out of the yard.
[02:22:49.395 --> 02:22:50.596]  He'd dig out under the fence.
[02:22:50.636 --> 02:22:52.656]  We were always putting wire under the fence to stop him.
[02:22:54.136 --> 02:22:56.737]  And I went with my wife and children for a jog around the lake.
[02:22:58.186 --> 02:23:02.747]  This Sunday, I got home and there was a nut on the door.
[02:23:02.787 --> 02:23:05.988]  He'd been plowed under by a car.
[02:23:06.008 --> 02:23:08.809]  I went and got his portable smash body.
[02:23:09.429 --> 02:23:12.230]  I'll tell you, I have cried probably 15 times over it.
[02:23:12.930 --> 02:23:17.291]  I love that dog like a person, especially because it's so little and sweet and smart.
[02:23:17.311 --> 02:23:20.432]  It was like one of my babies or something.
[02:23:20.552 --> 02:23:24.193]  It lets you know how short life is.
[02:23:24.473 --> 02:23:24.833]  Here I am.
[02:23:24.873 --> 02:23:26.694]  I've got all this serious news to talk about.
[02:23:28.556 --> 02:23:30.057]  I don't know.
[02:23:30.137 --> 02:23:31.118]  It's just a real loss.
[02:23:32.199 --> 02:23:36.082]  And then it makes you think about all the people you've loved and how they've died.
[02:23:36.122 --> 02:23:41.486]  And then I think about grandparents that have died and cousins that have died, family that's died.
[02:23:41.506 --> 02:23:46.029]  Had dreams about them the last two nights, Sunday night and Monday night.
[02:23:46.950 --> 02:23:49.011]  Wake up real sad over and over again.
[02:23:49.031 --> 02:23:50.472]  Such a sweet little dog.
[02:23:51.033 --> 02:23:53.795]  So good, so smart, so loving, so loyal.
[02:23:55.296 --> 02:23:57.638]  And to watch his metamorphosis from being a little
[02:23:58.246 --> 02:23:59.067]  You know, scared.
[02:24:00.490 --> 02:24:05.257]  Two-pound dog up to, you know, over three pounds and healthy and got a little bull.
[02:24:06.539 --> 02:24:08.662]  Just so sad, that sweet little dog.
[02:24:08.682 --> 02:24:13.910]  And it was really sad digging that little grave and putting him in the ground.
[02:24:15.257 --> 02:24:22.041]  Member of Parliament George Galloway is coming on to talk about his sterling rebuttal of the lying neocons.
[02:24:22.461 --> 02:24:24.042]  That's coming up after this break.
[02:24:24.602 --> 02:24:33.747]  Let's go ahead and go to part of his opening statements to the Senate Propaganda Committee a few weeks ago.
[02:24:33.807 --> 02:24:34.247]  Here it is.
[02:24:34.907 --> 02:24:37.249]  So there's nothing fanciful about this.
[02:24:37.929 --> 02:24:40.450]  Nothing at all fanciful about it.
[02:24:41.191 --> 02:24:43.372]  The existence of forged documents.
[02:24:44.489 --> 02:24:50.111]  Implicating me in commercial activities with the Iraqi regime is a proven fact.
[02:24:50.231 --> 02:25:03.917]  It's a proven fact that these forged documents existed and were being circulated amongst right-wing newspapers in Baghdad and around the world in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the Iraqi regime.
[02:25:04.157 --> 02:25:11.120]  Now Senator, I gave my heart and soul to oppose the policy that you promoted.
[02:25:12.256 --> 02:25:27.760]  I gave my political life's blood to try to stop the mass killing of Iraqis by the sanctions on Iraq, which killed a million Iraqis, most of them children.
[02:25:28.980 --> 02:25:41.123]  Most of them died before they even knew that they were Iraqis, but they died for no other reason other than that they were Iraqis, with the misfortune to be born at that time.
[02:25:42.219 --> 02:25:49.804]  I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit in invading Iraq.
[02:25:50.825 --> 02:25:56.689]  And I told the world that your case for the war was a pack of lies.
[02:25:57.590 --> 02:26:03.914]  I told the world that Iraq, contrary to your claims, did not have weapons of mass destruction.
[02:26:04.675 --> 02:26:10.619]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to Al-Qaeda.
[02:26:11.397 --> 02:26:19.342]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to the atrocity on 9-11-2001.
[02:26:19.903 --> 02:26:35.093]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that the Iraqi people would resist a British and American invasion of their country and that the fall of Baghdad would not be the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning.
[02:26:35.899 --> 02:26:43.122]  Senator, in everything I said about Iraq, I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong.
[02:26:43.642 --> 02:26:46.323]  And a hundred thousand people have paid with their lives.
[02:26:46.863 --> 02:26:52.906]  Sixteen hundred of them American soldiers sent to their deaths on a pack of lies.
[02:26:53.446 --> 02:26:59.168]  Fifteen thousand of them wounded, many of them disabled forever on a pack of lies.
[02:26:59.728 --> 02:27:04.410]  If the world had listened to Kofi Annan, whose dismissal you demanded,
[02:27:05.117 --> 02:27:19.282]  If the world had listened to President Chirac, who you want to paint as some kind of corrupt traitor, if the world had listened to me and the anti-war movement in Britain, we would not be in the disaster that we are in today.
[02:27:19.422 --> 02:27:20.162]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:20.543 --> 02:27:26.525]  We're going to come back with Member of Parliament George Galloway, a real trailblazer, honored that he's going to be joining us.
[02:27:26.545 --> 02:27:28.225]  We'll also finish up that little clip.
[02:27:28.986 --> 02:27:29.746]  Please stay with us.
[02:27:35.848 --> 02:27:36.731]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.233 --> 02:27:38.838]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.761 --> 02:27:42.449]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.781 --> 02:27:50.542]  For a while now, you've been hearing about energized water and what it can do for your health.

[02:29:45.251 --> 02:29:51.493]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:29:51.633 --> 02:29:57.795]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:29:58.075 --> 02:30:06.517]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:30:06.757 --> 02:30:13.779]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:30:14.079 --> 02:30:18.902]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:30:19.122 --> 02:30:24.526]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:30:24.866 --> 02:30:27.968]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:30:28.289 --> 02:30:36.254]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:30:36.294 --> 02:30:36.854]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:30:49.241 --> 02:31:02.647]  I heard that you are a free speech mind.
[02:31:02.667 --> 02:31:05.528]  I tell you, he's great to talk to in person.
[02:31:05.548 --> 02:31:09.210]  I just got a chance to talk to Mr. Galloway for the last few minutes during the break.
[02:31:09.230 --> 02:31:12.351]  We'll be talking to him live here in just a minute or two.
[02:31:13.220 --> 02:31:17.844]  An unbelievably intelligent and courageous individual.
[02:31:17.904 --> 02:31:21.788]  I wish we had more politicians like him here in the United States, but he's a statesman.
[02:31:22.700 --> 02:31:29.865]  And basically left the Labor Party because he refused to go along with their propaganda with Tony Blair and the CIA and MI6.
[02:31:30.485 --> 02:31:38.130]  And now he has just turned the tables on the lying neocons who were bearing false witness against him.
[02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:43.614]  And he's winning lawsuits against liars and other perpetrators of mass murder in Iraq.
[02:31:43.954 --> 02:31:45.375]  And so I want to just commend him.
[02:31:45.615 --> 02:31:47.016]  But here's about two minutes...
[02:31:47.596 --> 02:31:54.199]  I gave my political life's blood to try to stop the mass killing of Iraqis by the sanctions on Iraq, which killed a million Iraqis, most of them children.
[02:32:16.445 --> 02:32:20.047]  Most of them died before they even knew that they were Iraqis.
[02:32:20.827 --> 02:32:28.652]  But they died for no other reason other than that they were Iraqis, with the misfortune to be born at that time.
[02:32:29.692 --> 02:32:37.296]  I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit in invading Iraq.
[02:32:38.297 --> 02:32:43.780]  And I told the world that your case for the war was a pack of lies.
[02:32:45.049 --> 02:32:51.391]  I told the world that Iraq, contrary to your claims, did not have weapons of mass destruction.
[02:32:52.152 --> 02:32:58.094]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to Al-Qaeda.
[02:32:58.872 --> 02:33:06.817]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that Iraq had no connection to the atrocity on 9-11-2001.
[02:33:07.378 --> 02:33:22.568]  I told the world, contrary to your claims, that the Iraqi people would resist a British and American invasion of their country and that the fall of Baghdad would not be the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning.
[02:33:23.371 --> 02:33:30.575]  Senator, in everything I said about Iraq, I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong.
[02:33:31.116 --> 02:33:33.797]  And a hundred thousand people have paid with their lives.
[02:33:34.338 --> 02:33:40.381]  Sixteen hundred of them American soldiers sent to their deaths on a pack of lies.
[02:33:40.921 --> 02:33:46.665]  Fifteen thousand of them wounded, many of them disabled forever on a pack of lies.
[02:33:47.205 --> 02:33:51.888]  If the world had listened to Kofi Annan, whose dismissal you demanded,
[02:33:52.592 --> 02:34:06.802]  If the world had listened to President Chirac, who you want to paint as some kind of corrupt traitor, if the world had listened to me and the anti-war movement in Britain, we would not be in the disaster that we're in today.
[02:34:07.623 --> 02:34:11.125]  Senator, this is the mother of all smoke screens.
[02:34:12.006 --> 02:34:20.992]  You are trying to divert attention from the crimes that you supported, from the theft of billions of dollars of Iraq's wealth.
[02:34:22.242 --> 02:34:25.304]  Have a look at the real oil for food scandal.
[02:34:25.845 --> 02:34:37.113]  Have a look at the 14 months you were in charge of Baghdad, the first 14 months, when 8.8 billion dollars of Iraq's wealth went missing on your watch.
[02:34:37.773 --> 02:34:45.719]  Have a look at Halliburton and the other American corporations that stole not only Iraq's money, but the money of the American taxpayer.
[02:34:46.459 --> 02:34:49.001]  Have a look at the oil that you didn't even meter.
[02:34:49.787 --> 02:34:55.291]  That you were shipping out of the country and selling, the proceeds of which went who knows where.
[02:34:55.631 --> 02:35:04.718]  Have a look at the $800 million you gave to American military commanders to hand out around the country without even counting it or weighing it.
[02:35:04.858 --> 02:35:05.199]  Alright.
[02:35:06.239 --> 02:35:09.642]  Now, again, it goes on and on, and he totally turned the tables on them.
[02:35:10.122 --> 02:35:14.766]  This is the same crew that lied about Mr. Galloway, the Honorable Mr. Galloway, Member of Parliament.
[02:35:15.206 --> 02:35:16.307]  This is the same crew.
[02:35:17.361 --> 02:35:27.090]  That creates fake Niger uranium documents, that uses 12-year-old graduate student documents, that holds up vials of anthrax and comes up with 45-minute missile stories.
[02:35:27.411 --> 02:35:33.557]  This is the same crew that tried to plant weapons of mass destruction over and over again and always got caught lying.
[02:35:33.617 --> 02:35:36.359]  This is the crew that ordered the CIA to lie.
[02:35:36.419 --> 02:35:40.864]  This is the crew involved in all the bid rigging and Dick Cheney running the contracts out of the White House.
[02:35:41.304 --> 02:35:44.966]  Okay, enough of Mr. Galloway's earlier statements and my comments.
[02:35:45.246 --> 02:35:47.427]  Mr. Galloway, it's a great honor to have you joining us.
[02:35:47.727 --> 02:35:48.487]  It's a great pleasure.
[02:35:48.507 --> 02:35:49.188]  Anytime at all.
[02:35:50.368 --> 02:36:01.313]  Please give us in a nutshell what really happened here and then any new developments that you've discovered involving this monstrous fraud that they tried to falsely paint you with.
[02:36:01.874 --> 02:36:05.555]  Well, I think that the comments you've just made really sum it up.
[02:36:05.635 --> 02:36:09.237]  This is mendacity on a militarized scale.
[02:36:09.890 --> 02:36:27.497]  The British and American states were involved in spinning a story so vile and such a monumental lie that they will be damned forever in the history books and beyond that into the hellfires themselves.
[02:36:28.163 --> 02:36:33.109]  Because they have killed a huge number of people on that pack of lies.
[02:36:33.149 --> 02:36:35.853]  This is not just like lying to win an election.
[02:36:36.273 --> 02:36:39.838]  It's not lying about what you think of the economic curve.
[02:36:40.279 --> 02:36:43.423]  It's not lying on a normal political scale.
[02:36:44.043 --> 02:36:53.569]  This is lying on a scale that has plunged the world into a disaster, the bottom of which we have very definitely not yet reached.
[02:36:54.189 --> 02:37:05.917]  The reverberations of the war on Iraq, the invasion and its occupation, will continue as long as you and I are alive and probably as long as our children are alive.
[02:37:06.477 --> 02:37:11.841]  They have scarred the face of the international legal and political systems.
[02:37:12.361 --> 02:37:19.146]  They have undermined respect for democratic government in your country and in mine.
[02:37:19.726 --> 02:37:25.530]  They have polarized the world between the West and the East, between the North and the South.
[02:37:26.131 --> 02:37:33.696]  They have made hundreds of millions of people hate us, even more intently than they already hated us.
[02:37:34.315 --> 02:37:42.699]  And with a charge sheet like that, it's no wonder that those responsible are throwing up what I call the mother of all smoke screens.
[02:37:43.199 --> 02:37:45.980]  Because they have to fool us one more time.
[02:37:46.440 --> 02:37:51.402]  They have to take our eyes off the real issues and the real villains of the peace.
[02:37:52.003 --> 02:37:58.385]  And so they construct false villains, windmills at which they wish the people to tilt.
[02:37:58.846 --> 02:37:59.706]  Like Kofi Annan.
[02:38:00.382 --> 02:38:08.929]  Who has enraged them forever by describing their war as an illegal war, meaning that they are criminals.
[02:38:09.330 --> 02:38:20.019]  Those responsible for an illegal war are what they said at Nuremberg in 1945, guilty of the, and I quote, paramount war crime.
[02:38:20.519 --> 02:38:25.721]  Which is a crime of aggression, the illegal invasion of another people's country.
[02:38:26.461 --> 02:38:39.125]  These people want to turn your aisle against President Chirac in France, against people like me in the anti-war movement in Britain, against people like Scott Ritter, the former American arms inspector.
[02:38:39.525 --> 02:38:40.946]  They want to have you running around
[02:38:41.905 --> 02:38:51.953]  On inquiry after inquiry, based on their forged documents, instead of putting them on trial, at least politically, and sweeping them out of office.
[02:38:52.213 --> 02:39:00.559]  We're talking to the Member of Parliament, George Galloway, and George, are there any particular websites or places you'd like to point our listeners so they can...
[02:39:01.379 --> 02:39:17.547]  Kind of get an idea of what really happened here, because I want to go into how they tried to forge documents on you, and then how you turned the tables on them, and also any new developments, because there's so many forgeries that they tried to use against you that they kind of got caught up in each other's feet and stumbled.
[02:39:18.027 --> 02:39:22.870]  Yes, they did, and people can read about it at the respectcoalition.org.
[02:39:23.310 --> 02:39:27.132]  That's www.respectcoalition, all one word.
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:33.844]  And there they will see the story as it unfolded now over nearly three years.
[02:39:34.004 --> 02:39:36.786]  But they put out so many lies, their lies contradicted each other.
[02:39:37.086 --> 02:39:47.274]  Yes, the forged documents couldn't keep up with the other forgeries, and therefore were throwing up mutually incompatible stories.
[02:39:47.854 --> 02:39:51.177]  If I take one that's of particular interest to American listeners,
[02:39:51.915 --> 02:40:08.537]  It is the one perpetrated by the Christian Science Monitor, generally regarded as one of the world's great newspaper titles, but who purchased a set of documents from someone claiming to be an Iraqi general within a few days of the fall of Baghdad.
[02:40:09.364 --> 02:40:21.892]  They placed that on their front page around the world, and on their website around the world, that I had received $10 million from a son of Saddam Hussein whom I had never met.
[02:40:22.012 --> 02:40:25.053]  But it turns out the oil for food program didn't even exist then.
[02:40:25.334 --> 02:40:25.774]  Exactly.
[02:40:26.234 --> 02:40:36.220]  A son of Saddam Hussein I had never even met, and starting in a year I had never yet set foot in Iraq, and finishing on a given date, an actual date,
[02:40:36.924 --> 02:40:40.999]  When instead of being in Iraq as they claim, collecting another million dollar check,
[02:40:41.661 --> 02:40:43.463]  Which is another ludicrous aspect too.
[02:40:43.763 --> 02:40:53.511]  Iraq of course under quarantine was not part of the international banking system so a check from the Iraqi regime would have been as useful as toilet paper.
[02:40:54.632 --> 02:41:07.222]  The date that they chose was in fact demonstrably in the House of Commons on the Guardian website doing an interactive interview with the Guardian's readers.
[02:41:07.743 --> 02:41:07.903]  Now,
[02:41:08.483 --> 02:41:18.634]  I said on the day they called me about this in the English press because the Christian Science Monitor made no effort to contact me or put that allegation to me.
[02:41:18.774 --> 02:41:20.716]  And by the way, your background is journalism.
[02:41:20.756 --> 02:41:21.937]  You know about real journalism.
[02:41:22.057 --> 02:41:27.303]  I do know about journalism and I am a columnist and a journalist of many years standing.
[02:41:27.856 --> 02:41:39.400]  But when the English press, following this story up, contacted me, and I told them the truth, I was denounced by the neocon journals in the United States.
[02:41:39.500 --> 02:41:40.640]  I was clearly guilty.
[02:41:41.020 --> 02:41:45.061]  According to them, I had become a multi-millionaire thanks to Saddam Hussein.
[02:41:45.662 --> 02:41:53.184]  The only problem is, and then an English newspaper bought a set of documents off the same ersatz general.
[02:41:53.951 --> 02:42:18.190]  And they subjected their documents to forensic examination, only to discover that the signatures on them were forged, that the information within the documents was mutually contradictory, and when I gave them my passports to check the dates I had come and gone from Iraq, they didn't match up with the times I was supposed to be in Iraq picking up money.
[02:42:18.590 --> 02:42:22.693]  Now, as you said... The Christian Science Monitor then forensically examined their own documents,
[02:42:23.163 --> 02:42:27.265]  You might think they should have done that before they published the smear against me.
[02:42:27.765 --> 02:42:34.567]  But they subjected their own documents to chemical ink, forensic analysis, and the whole thing came down like a pack of cards.
[02:42:35.107 --> 02:42:37.328]  It was a crude set of forgeries.
[02:42:37.788 --> 02:42:38.809]  And an intricate one.
[02:42:39.149 --> 02:42:41.870]  And one which had been done within days of the fall of Baghdad.
[02:42:42.330 --> 02:42:46.034]  Now, sir, you have never, as you've said, taken one thin dime.
[02:42:46.374 --> 02:42:58.144]  You, and you're on record, I went and checked in LexisNexis, you had actually protested our government's giving Saddam the anthrax, the botulism, the chemical weapons decades ago.
[02:42:58.445 --> 02:43:06.552]  Yes, and I'll tell you what, not one of the new Labour government that's currently in power and in league with George Bush was with me on the protest.
[02:43:07.112 --> 02:43:07.693]  Not one of them.
[02:43:08.146 --> 02:43:16.052]  No Tony Blairs, no Jack Straws, nobody from the current New Labour hierarchy ever set foot on any of our demonstrations.
[02:43:16.512 --> 02:43:36.686]  As a matter of fact, when we were demonstrating outside Downing Street against the presence there of the Iraqi government leaders, Douglas Hurd, who was then the Foreign Office Minister, told the Iraqi leaders that we who were protesting for democracy and human rights in Iraq were just a bunch of communist troublemakers.
[02:43:37.498 --> 02:43:38.479]  That's what we were doing.
[02:43:38.519 --> 02:43:49.328]  We were accused of causing trouble for those who were making big money out of the special relationship that British and American companies had with the Iraqi regime.
[02:43:49.769 --> 02:44:02.740]  I want to know, there's so many forgeries and so many lies, and those are now admitted to be lies, by the papers that did it themselves, but the neocons, sir, I listen to them, they're still slandering you and still crucifying you on a daily basis.
[02:44:03.476 --> 02:44:04.137]  Yes, they are.
[02:44:04.337 --> 02:44:07.379]  But I fear that fewer and fewer people are listening.
[02:44:07.999 --> 02:44:23.390]  My impression of my very brief visit to the United States, which I hope to follow up with a speaking tour over the summer months, is that there are a vast number of American citizens who've already seen through this crew, this neocon.
[02:44:23.550 --> 02:44:24.230]  A lot of their supporters.
[02:44:24.251 --> 02:44:25.471]  A Christian fundamentalist.
[02:44:25.571 --> 02:44:27.193]  A lot of their former supporters.
[02:44:27.673 --> 02:44:27.973]  Yes.
[02:44:29.034 --> 02:44:31.956]  By the way, one of the amazing things about your neocons...
[02:44:32.535 --> 02:44:37.198]  Is that so many of them used to be Trotskyists and Marxists of one variety or another.
[02:44:37.679 --> 02:44:45.004]  They've exchanged one zealotry for another zealotry, even though it's facing in entirely the opposite direction to the one they used to face.
[02:44:45.664 --> 02:44:51.308]  But my impression is that fewer and fewer people are listening to these neocon journals and websites.
[02:44:51.900 --> 02:44:56.361]  Because I've had this fantastic response from the people of the United States.
[02:44:56.741 --> 02:45:01.623]  And I'm looking forward to meeting many of them at the speaking engagements I do in the United States over the summer.
[02:45:01.823 --> 02:45:05.023]  You told me that you've gotten 20,000 emails from Americans.
[02:45:05.704 --> 02:45:06.724]  Yes.
[02:45:06.744 --> 02:45:07.144]  20,000 emails.
[02:45:07.404 --> 02:45:11.125]  And it's not easy for an American to get hold of the email address.
[02:45:11.878 --> 02:45:18.282]  Of a British member of Parliament, which is, by the way, gallowayg at parliament.uk.
[02:45:18.682 --> 02:45:20.824]  gallowayg at parliament.uk.
[02:45:20.964 --> 02:45:21.844]  Well, let me just say this.
[02:45:21.884 --> 02:45:23.585]  The better, we should all stay in touch.
[02:45:23.925 --> 02:45:31.350]  We should make a big network on both sides of the Atlantic, because your country and my country are the biggest problems in the world today.
[02:45:31.710 --> 02:45:33.191]  We're the biggest rogue states.
[02:45:33.661 --> 02:45:34.461]  In the world today.
[02:45:34.761 --> 02:45:37.242]  And the citizens have got to take back control of the plane.
[02:45:37.642 --> 02:45:41.404]  Well, Mr. Galloway, isn't it that the elite corporations aren't even free market now?
[02:45:41.684 --> 02:45:47.846]  They've seized control of Airstrip One England and the United States as an engine of global domination?
[02:45:48.286 --> 02:45:49.606]  That's absolutely right.
[02:45:49.726 --> 02:45:52.707]  Military spending is the welfare of capitalism.
[02:45:53.128 --> 02:45:57.049]  It's being used war after war to prime the pumps.
[02:45:57.697 --> 02:46:09.127]  Of the big corporations, some of the profits from those corporations goes back into the political system as recycled campaign dollars and then the governments hand out the contracts all over again.
[02:46:09.147 --> 02:46:17.795]  Well, sir, this year we had record numbers of weapons being sold to third world dictators and in five years our government will then invade those countries calling them dictators.
[02:46:17.955 --> 02:46:18.696]  Exactly so.
[02:46:18.876 --> 02:46:24.621]  And we have a big arms fair coming up in my own constituency in East London later this year
[02:46:25.251 --> 02:46:39.192]  And when it was last year, two years ago and we turned up to protest the government turned out an anti-terrorist order to blockade the area not against the dictators that were inside buying arms
[02:46:39.727 --> 02:46:44.450]  But against the peaceful protesters who are outside complaining about it.
[02:46:44.490 --> 02:46:50.394]  And as you say, they will very quickly invade those countries, calling them dictators, having just armed them.
[02:46:50.655 --> 02:46:52.976]  Mr. Galloway, we don't have a lot of time left with you.
[02:46:53.016 --> 02:47:04.104]  I wanted to get into any new developments concerning the neocons and their real profiteering from the war, and any new developments, because when you were there in front of the Senate, I mean, they looked scared.
[02:47:04.124 --> 02:47:08.347]  Did they expect you to come back and fight them, or do they think you'd just take it?
[02:47:08.747 --> 02:47:10.329]  Well, the truth has wings.
[02:47:10.829 --> 02:47:12.330]  And God gave me wings that day.
[02:47:12.410 --> 02:47:13.371]  I was really flying.
[02:47:13.391 --> 02:47:15.473]  I know this subject inside out.
[02:47:16.093 --> 02:47:21.278]  And I was right, as was the anti-war movement in both the United States and Great Britain.
[02:47:21.718 --> 02:47:25.481]  We said exactly what would happen, and it's now happening.
[02:47:25.521 --> 02:47:31.186]  And since I was in front of that committee in Washington, some more brave American boys have lost their lives.
[02:47:31.626 --> 02:47:32.947]  Others have lost their limbs.
[02:47:33.388 --> 02:47:35.689]  And many, many more Iraqis have been killed.
[02:47:36.190 --> 02:47:37.171]  In the month of May,
[02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:40.912]  Almost a thousand people lost their lives in one month.
[02:47:41.592 --> 02:47:43.613]  And that's just the ones we bothered to count.
[02:47:44.253 --> 02:47:51.777]  The number of operations taking place in Iraq between the resistance and the occupation forces is now at record levels.
[02:47:52.381 --> 02:47:57.223]  Just months after they told us that there was an election in Iraq and that was the beginning of the end.
[02:47:57.664 --> 02:48:00.305]  They've trumpeted the beginning of the end so many times.
[02:48:00.805 --> 02:48:02.266]  Nobody's listening anymore.
[02:48:02.766 --> 02:48:06.188]  In fact, we're in for a long, bloody haul in Iraq.
[02:48:06.548 --> 02:48:09.469]  Many more young American boys will lose their lives as a result.
[02:48:09.690 --> 02:48:12.471]  That's what I wanted to ask you is, where do you think all this is going?
[02:48:13.031 --> 02:48:15.352]  Well, I think Britain and America are sunk in a swamp.
[02:48:15.433 --> 02:48:17.113]  They can't go forward, they can't go back.
[02:48:17.714 --> 02:48:25.378]  If they withdraw out of the cities into the camps that they're building, the resistance will take over control of the streets overnight.
[02:48:25.978 --> 02:48:29.600]  If they stay on the streets, they'll be the target for the resistance.
[02:48:29.640 --> 02:48:32.382]  The resistance is getting stronger and stronger.
[02:48:32.422 --> 02:48:33.963]  You know, Mr. Galloway, we're out of time.
[02:48:34.003 --> 02:48:37.945]  Can I hold you just a few more minutes after the break so you can give us more of your analysis?
[02:48:38.245 --> 02:48:39.146]  Of course you can, sir, yes.
[02:48:39.226 --> 02:48:40.326]  All right, thank you so much.
[02:48:40.366 --> 02:48:41.447]  We're really honored to have you.
[02:48:42.389 --> 02:48:43.770]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:49:06.867 --> 02:49:13.612]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.832 --> 02:49:18.235]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.475 --> 02:49:25.701]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:25.941 --> 02:49:28.363]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.523 --> 02:49:30.284]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:45.603 --> 02:49:53.127]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:53.408 --> 02:50:04.314]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:04.574 --> 02:50:06.394]  Yet require very little energy.
[02:50:06.654 --> 02:50:09.975]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:50:10.315 --> 02:50:20.777]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:50:21.057 --> 02:50:21.558]  That's right.
[02:50:21.758 --> 02:50:28.859]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:29.159 --> 02:50:33.200]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter.
[02:50:33.200 --> 02:50:33.881]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:46.622 --> 02:50:53.527]  Sandal season is finally here, but not for those of us too embarrassed to wear them because of yellow, unsightly toenails.
[02:50:54.047 --> 02:50:59.470]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now's the time to start using patented Nonex Nail Gel.
[02:50:59.871 --> 02:51:09.897]  All-natural Nonex is a topical, epinoic acid gel that clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under the nails called keratin debris.
[02:51:10.017 --> 02:51:12.339]  Nonex Nail Gel is absolutely amazing.
[02:51:12.359 --> 02:51:15.781]  I used to have yellow nails, and now they look clear and almost perfect.
[02:51:16.261 --> 02:51:17.422]  I'm wearing sandals again.
[02:51:17.562 --> 02:51:25.045]  Non-X Nail Gel removes yellowing keratin debris, is podiatrist recommended, and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:51:25.305 --> 02:51:27.045]  It's also money-back guarantee.
[02:51:27.385 --> 02:51:39.130]  You'll find Non-X Gel, spelled N-O-N-Y-X, in the foot care section at Rite Aid, Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, and independent pharmacies nationwide, or online at drugstore.com.
[02:51:39.630 --> 02:51:43.972]  Non-X Nail Gel, for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:51:52.185 --> 02:51:54.066]  A big guest coming up in the third hour.
[02:51:54.147 --> 02:51:59.670]  Our government knowingly knew that HIV and hepatitis was in the blood supply and shipped it all over the world.
[02:51:59.811 --> 02:52:01.071]  Europe, Canada, and the U.S.
[02:52:01.452 --> 02:52:04.194]  Tens of thousands got HIV and hepatitis from it.
[02:52:04.514 --> 02:52:05.715]  That's in the BBC today.
[02:52:06.295 --> 02:52:08.036]  We'll be covering that coming up in the third hour.
[02:52:08.056 --> 02:52:15.602]  We've got Mr. Galloway for a few more minutes, a member of Parliament, a man of conscience who we really appreciate joining us today.
[02:52:16.648 --> 02:52:19.570]  Mr. Galloway, during the break I was talking to you.
[02:52:19.710 --> 02:52:29.596]  You're about to collect on $600,000 from your libel slander suit against newspapers that printed these lies.
[02:52:29.616 --> 02:52:34.259]  Yes, $600,000 to me and about the best part of $3 million to the lawyers.
[02:52:35.300 --> 02:52:37.982]  So the costs and damages have been very great.
[02:52:39.083 --> 02:52:45.787]  Saddam Hussein gave me nothing but the newspapers who alleged that he had are having to pay very dearly for those lies.
[02:52:46.547 --> 02:52:55.953]  And where I can, I will tackle the American outlets that are still peddling these same discredited lies about me.
[02:52:56.473 --> 02:53:03.138]  Unfortunately, these senators made their attack behind the cowardly cloak of parliamentary privilege.
[02:53:03.578 --> 02:53:06.059]  So I can't sue them for what they said about me.
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:08.001]  But I helped demolish it, I think.
[02:53:08.081 --> 02:53:11.823]  It was a house of cards that fell down with a bit of huff and puff from me.
[02:53:12.243 --> 02:53:15.045]  It all fell down because it was based on nothing at all.
[02:53:16.037 --> 02:53:21.999]  But a much more important issue is how we stop this disaster, not just in Iraq, but around the world.
[02:53:22.419 --> 02:53:39.683]  We really have to pull our countries out of this coalition of the killing, because it's making people all over the world hate us, it's damaging our interests, it's endangering our citizens when they travel or when they work and live abroad, and we really have to get out of this nosedive that we are in.
[02:53:40.303 --> 02:53:46.726]  So, I hope that people will look at our website, that's respectcoalition.org, and will stay in touch with me.
[02:53:46.806 --> 02:53:55.569]  Send me, by any means, your email, gallowayg at parliament dot uk, and I'll let you know when my speaking tour begins, the big cities I'm going.
[02:53:56.050 --> 02:53:59.211]  One of the main places where there's a huge demand is Minnesota.
[02:53:59.798 --> 02:54:18.403]  Where they used to have an honorable senator called Wellstone, who was mysteriously killed in a plane accident, and who was succeeded by none other than the smarmy Norman Coleman, the man who chaired the Senate McCarthyite witch hunt into me, the author of The Mother of All Smokescreens.
[02:54:18.863 --> 02:54:20.603]  They said he was a presidential hopeful.
[02:54:20.943 --> 02:54:24.104]  He didn't much look like a presidential hopeful by the time I was finished with him.
[02:54:24.887 --> 02:54:26.589]  Just two more final questions.
[02:54:26.609 --> 02:54:27.209]  We're going to let you go.
[02:54:27.229 --> 02:54:29.751]  I know you're very busy, and it's evening over there in London right now.
[02:54:30.292 --> 02:54:35.276]  Mr. Galloway, George Galloway, looking at this, you've gotten to Iraq falling apart.
[02:54:36.517 --> 02:54:45.865]  The Pentagon's own P2OG documents, perhaps folks should send this to you, said they want to widen the hatred, cause more attacks as a pretext to invade more countries.
[02:54:46.226 --> 02:54:48.628]  Where do you see this ending, and will they go into Iran?
[02:54:49.620 --> 02:54:51.281]  I think they're too weak to do so.
[02:54:51.461 --> 02:54:54.784]  I think the Iraqi resistance has stopped them in their tracks.
[02:54:55.384 --> 02:54:59.987]  Undoubtedly, they planned to go into Iran and Syria for that matter.
[02:55:00.427 --> 02:55:05.410]  But I don't believe that the public opinion in your country or mine would follow them there.
[02:55:05.651 --> 02:55:08.392]  But Israel doesn't care about public opinion.
[02:55:08.412 --> 02:55:10.594]  They're saying they'll go ahead and may attack Iran.
[02:55:11.154 --> 02:55:18.897]  Well, there's an opinion poll yesterday in the British press which showed fully 86% of the British people would oppose an attack on Iran.
[02:55:19.357 --> 02:55:23.818]  So if George Bush does decide to do that, on this one you'll have to count us out.
[02:55:24.178 --> 02:55:26.399]  What if Israel drags us in?
[02:55:26.639 --> 02:55:27.819]  Well, that's a possibility.
[02:55:28.219 --> 02:55:29.620]  Israel might strike Iran.
[02:55:30.260 --> 02:55:36.803]  And undoubtedly they're trying to stab Syria in the back rather than in the front.
[02:55:36.863 --> 02:55:39.225]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.
[02:55:39.285 --> 02:55:40.165]  Well, I have another article.
[02:55:40.385 --> 02:55:43.067]  RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war.
[02:55:43.107 --> 02:55:46.848]  Times of London, they may try to goad Iran into doing something.
[02:55:47.209 --> 02:55:51.050]  Yes, but people are not fools in these countries.
[02:55:51.151 --> 02:55:57.894]  They have their own sophisticated political class and they know that Bush and Blair are too weak at the moment
[02:55:58.354 --> 02:55:59.394]  We've got 30 seconds.
[02:55:59.414 --> 02:56:05.536]  What do we do if the military-industrial complex carries out a terror attack, deployment on them?
[02:56:15.739 --> 02:56:18.662]  Well, that's another very real danger.
[02:56:18.762 --> 02:56:24.706]  There's no way that we can legislate for that, but we must be on guard.
[02:56:24.747 --> 02:56:26.868]  We need a vigilant citizenry.
[02:56:27.289 --> 02:56:27.949]  Unbelievable.
[02:56:28.229 --> 02:56:33.433]  We need a vigilant citizenry that's alive to all the tricks that these monkeys are up to.
[02:56:33.634 --> 02:56:34.514]  I salute you.
[02:56:34.734 --> 02:56:35.395]  Thank you very much.
