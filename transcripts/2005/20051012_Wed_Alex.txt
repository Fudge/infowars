[00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.581]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:08.301]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.021 --> 00:00:10.142]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.782 --> 00:00:11.582]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.362 --> 00:00:13.263]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.903 --> 00:00:17.564]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.104 --> 00:00:22.185]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:29.642 --> 00:00:40.029]  Well, there's a whole constellation, a galaxy, a nebula, a universe of important stories and news items and, of course, your calls.
[00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.671]  It is Wednesday.
[00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:43.451]  We're live.
[00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:45.493]  The 12th day of October, 2005.
[00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:50.636]  I got a big date today, and I'm going to let every minute of it.
[00:00:51.303 --> 00:01:00.969]  Got three hours here, then two live TV shows tonight to do, and I'm going to be on coast-to-coast AM this evening debunking peak oil.
[00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.291]  I really appreciate George Norrie having me on to do this.
[00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:06.173]  Four, three hours tonight.
[00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:10.636]  So this little soldier has got his work cut out for him.
[00:01:10.956 --> 00:01:16.600]  We're going to have wide open phones today, but we've had a lot of requests.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.902]  In fact, last night I was already intending
[00:01:20.589 --> 00:01:26.373]  To re-air at least part of the Ron Paul interview that we did yesterday, today.
[00:01:27.674 --> 00:01:41.944]  The last 30 minutes of the broadcast we had Congressman Ron Paul on and he dropped bombshell after bombshell after just hydrogen bombshell of political information.
[00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:45.686]  Namely, I said, why does Bush want Marshall Law so bad?
[00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:46.307]  And they said, well,
[00:01:47.282 --> 00:01:50.464]  Of course, to suppress the population and to confiscate our guns!
[00:01:52.366 --> 00:02:00.171]  And we have the text of that interview and an article written about it, that Paul Watson took the time to do today, up on PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:02.033]  Every website needs to link to it.
[00:02:02.513 --> 00:02:03.814]  Everybody needs to see it.
[00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:12.160]  Ron Paul has never, I repeat, never gone this far, even in his legendary neocon speech.
[00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:23.650]  Everybody needs to get this article and it needs to get out there, but I know that a lot of people, you know, tune into the first or second hour, and then we have an audience that tends to tune in the third hour.
[00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:27.291]  I mean, the average talk radio listener listens about 16 minutes.
[00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:34.773]  We've got stations, CUME numbers from around the country, and the average is around 45 minutes.
[00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:40.955]  So we blow most talk shows away on CUME and on time spent listening.
[00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:44.066]  Time spent listening is actually the term I wanted to use.
[00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:45.906]  Cume is something separate.
[00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:48.487]  We also have very high cume when we do get the ratings.
[00:02:50.048 --> 00:02:59.431]  But to make a long story short, even though our listeners listen for about 45 minutes on average, still, most of you did miss that last 30 minutes of the broadcast.
[00:02:59.611 --> 00:03:04.193]  That is the least listened to portion of this transmission.
[00:03:04.233 --> 00:03:05.213]  We know that from numbers.
[00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:10.255]  The middle of the show, the second hour, is the biggest.
[00:03:10.956 --> 00:03:14.117]  So I want you to be able to hear this, because it's a big deal.
[00:03:14.177 --> 00:03:21.299]  I mean, Dr. Paul, Congressman Paul, has nothing but an impeccable record, and he gives you the same analysis that I would.
[00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.380]  I mean, it's simply about taking the blinders off.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.101]  There's no other way to see it.
[00:03:26.401 --> 00:03:29.902]  There's no other way to... We have the historical lens.
[00:03:30.402 --> 00:03:32.343]  We have this administration's own statements.
[00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:34.704]  So coming up in about 25 minutes,
[00:03:37.647 --> 00:03:39.308]  27 minutes to be precise.
[00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:41.029]  We come out of break at 33 after.
[00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:48.473]  I'm going to play one segment of the interview where he really made a lot of the amazing statements.
[00:03:49.093 --> 00:03:50.054]  I hope you'll record it.
[00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:52.035]  I hope you'll give it to friends and family.
[00:03:52.495 --> 00:03:58.598]  Or if you want a high quality CD of it or a mp3 of it, you can also get an entire month of the show for $19.95.
[00:03:58.998 --> 00:04:00.639]  I don't sell that.
[00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:02.380]  The network does.
[00:04:03.144 --> 00:04:08.848]  And she can support them by going to the network GCNLive.com and ordering yesterday's show.
[00:04:08.868 --> 00:04:12.290]  You'll get the whole month, but it's marked down as the 11th of October.
[00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:19.554]  By the way, we are posting it for PrisonPlanet.tv members, of course, and we'll put some of the key excerpts out for everybody.
[00:04:20.015 --> 00:04:29.841]  We're a very small team, and we're also preparing for the debunking of the peak oil tonight with the Honorable George Norrie.
[00:04:30.041 --> 00:04:31.462]  I really look forward to that.
[00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.232]  When we get back, we'll get into all the other news, and we'll re-air part of the Hall interview.
[00:04:38.872 --> 00:04:39.352]  Hall!
[00:04:39.412 --> 00:04:41.193]  Americans want Bush impeachment.
[00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:41.673]  Ah!
[00:04:42.654 --> 00:04:43.954]  This is out of the London Independent.
[00:04:44.154 --> 00:04:46.795]  GM crop ruins fields for 15 years.
[00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:49.376]  Peak oil is a corrupt globalist scam.
[00:04:49.396 --> 00:04:50.116]  I'm going to go over that.
[00:04:50.537 --> 00:04:52.957]  Schwarzenegger signs deals for two big movies.
[00:04:53.057 --> 00:04:53.778]  Total liar.
[00:04:54.118 --> 00:04:55.118]  Swore he wouldn't do that.
[00:04:55.798 --> 00:04:56.859]  Bird flu.
[00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:58.720]  Major developments there.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.600]  It's all coming up.
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.980]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:05.560]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.421]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.741 --> 00:05:12.424]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.764 --> 00:05:17.186]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.606 --> 00:05:21.788]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:22.008 --> 00:05:24.849]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:29.611]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.811 --> 00:05:34.213]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:41.675]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.935 --> 00:05:44.336]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:01.733 --> 00:06:05.214]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:06:05.474 --> 00:06:08.975]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:09.075 --> 00:06:13.016]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:13.237 --> 00:06:19.398]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:19.799 --> 00:06:27.701]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:28.121 --> 00:06:33.465]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury and aluminum.
[00:06:33.625 --> 00:06:37.408]  Get the Black Berkey Filter Elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:37.768 --> 00:06:39.650]  And the Black Berkey Filters are recleanable.
[00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:41.832]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:42.092 --> 00:06:46.695]  Normally $48 each, you get a 2-pack for only $91 or a 4-pack for only $173.

[00:06:56.002 --> 00:06:58.424]  That's 808-803-4438.
[00:06:58.444 --> 00:06:59.844]  Protect your family.
[00:07:01.385 --> 00:07:04.187]  Let's face it, we know that we're less than perfect when it comes to our diets.
[00:07:04.287 --> 00:07:09.370]  We all eat sugar, saturated fat, salt, probably don't get the exercise we should, and we all have to deal with daily stress.
[00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:15.774]  And all the vitamins and supplements in the world won't help you if your immune system is compromised because of our less than perfect eating habits and lifestyles.
[00:07:16.034 --> 00:07:21.637]  That's why Agaricus Bio is the number one dietary supplement that you should consider an absolute must if you're going to take any at all.
[00:07:21.937 --> 00:07:24.638]  The immune system is your body's first line of defense against disease.
[00:07:24.878 --> 00:07:27.438]  And Agaricus Bio strengthens and supports your immune system.
[00:07:27.698 --> 00:07:31.519]  That's why it's become the most popular immune support system for people and pets in Japan.
[00:07:31.539 --> 00:07:37.821]  A one-month supply of Agaricus Bio is only $34.95, and that's a small price to pay considering the alternatives.
[00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:38.561]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:07:38.981 --> 00:07:43.682]  That's 877-817-9829, or visit ThePowerMall.com.
[00:07:43.842 --> 00:07:47.983]  How many times have you heard about people taking vitamin C and other vitamins and supplements to fight a cold?
[00:07:48.223 --> 00:07:51.147]  Well, with a Garricus Bio, you might not catch that cold in the first place.
[00:07:51.327 --> 00:07:56.233]  Call 877-817-9829 or visit thepowermall.com and order today.
[00:07:56.453 --> 00:07:57.274]  A Garricus Bio.
[00:07:57.294 --> 00:07:58.776]  Because healthy is what you want to be.
[00:08:02.308 --> 00:08:04.510]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:07.913]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:13.617 --> 00:08:16.540]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.083]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[00:08:22.104 --> 00:08:25.847]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time.
[00:08:25.907 --> 00:08:29.110]  Back from 9 to midnight Central Standard Time.
[00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.611]  I am so honored to be your host.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.442]  I am humbled, I am blessed, I am blown away, I am amazed!
[00:08:36.223 --> 00:08:37.003]  I am daunted!
[00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:43.668]  That I have this responsibility and that so many of you put so much trust in me.
[00:08:44.328 --> 00:08:48.351]  But deep down folks, we are all in this together and we all know it.
[00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:52.414]  And that message telegraphs between all of us together right now.
[00:08:54.075 --> 00:09:01.080]  You know, every day I'm just impressed by, I'm imprinted by, it's like I've been stamped by it.
[00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:02.595]  In a good way.
[00:09:03.235 --> 00:09:23.615]  I've been marked by it, by how short life is, how wonderful life is, how beautiful God's creations are, and His universe and His world, and how beautiful and tender and sweet so many individuals and people and children are, and all the good in the world.
[00:09:25.874 --> 00:09:36.700]  Now, the more I focus on the evil, the more I focus on its activities and the plans it's laid and the operations that it's executing, the more I realize why we fight it.
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:51.247]  Because of all the goodness in the world that we're trying to protect, all the goodness, all the purity, all the simplicity, all the majesty, all of the just unfathomable, undescribable
[00:09:52.097 --> 00:10:00.483]  gulfs and mountains and reaches of just unutterable life.
[00:10:02.805 --> 00:10:03.605]  I mean, think about it.
[00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:13.312]  We're alive one time here on this sphere that is 18,000 miles in circumference with an atmosphere
[00:10:14.139 --> 00:10:36.572]  An incredibly thin atmosphere with the gulfs of space out beyond us and we get to look up at the night sky and see Jupiter and see Mars and see Venus and to see Saturn and to see shooting stars and satellites in the heavens and jet airplanes flying overhead and birds nesting in the eaves of your house and
[00:10:37.805 --> 00:10:53.169]  Your children happily running and playing and just totally enthralled by the majesty of life and the incredible exultation of discovery just bubbling over with love and life and dynamic human spirit.
[00:10:54.369 --> 00:10:55.469]  That's what we're guarding.
[00:10:55.529 --> 00:11:01.130]  That's what we're fighting the New World Order for because believe me, I mean I've studied them.
[00:11:01.170 --> 00:11:02.231]  They really hate that.
[00:11:02.311 --> 00:11:03.471]  They really don't like it.
[00:11:04.053 --> 00:11:05.334]  They really are after it!
[00:11:05.494 --> 00:11:06.715]  They want to destroy it!
[00:11:06.755 --> 00:11:07.576]  They are sick!
[00:11:07.976 --> 00:11:08.837]  They are broken!
[00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:09.677]  They are fallen!
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.262]  Interview with Ron Paul is coming up.
[00:11:15.502 --> 00:11:23.308]  I'm just going to re-air one segment of the interview where he dropped the most bombshells, including Bush's plan for martial law and gun confiscation.
[00:11:23.328 --> 00:11:25.950]  That's coming up in 20 minutes.
[00:11:27.371 --> 00:11:32.895]  And then we'll just take calls for the broadcast and cover news, but... And there's so much of it.
[00:11:34.918 --> 00:11:39.005]  But really, I mean, how can you spend all day playing video games?
[00:11:40.367 --> 00:11:43.572]  How can you spend all day drinking beer?
[00:11:44.685 --> 00:11:48.687]  How can you spend all day going to football games and only caring about football or baseball?
[00:11:49.067 --> 00:11:51.048]  How can you spend all day at the shopping mall?
[00:11:51.428 --> 00:11:53.369]  How could you spend all day?
[00:11:53.429 --> 00:11:53.890]  I mean, listen.
[00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:56.631]  I have to tear myself away.
[00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:59.552]  I literally lust after going camping.
[00:11:59.873 --> 00:12:01.614]  I lust after walking in the woods.
[00:12:01.914 --> 00:12:03.955]  I lust after climbing mountains.
[00:12:04.795 --> 00:12:06.336]  I just want to ride bikes.
[00:12:06.876 --> 00:12:08.358]  You know, through the hillside.
[00:12:08.538 --> 00:12:11.041]  I want to spend time with my family.
[00:12:11.281 --> 00:12:14.105]  I literally want to go swimming in cool rivers.
[00:12:14.625 --> 00:12:20.312]  I just constantly think about how I want to go fishing.
[00:12:21.801 --> 00:12:39.766]  And believe me, ladies and gentlemen, if I wasn't fighting the New World Order, and I wasn't involved in all this, I would own some business, I'd build it up, I'd have employees, so I could end up taking off a couple days a week to go enjoy God's beautiful creation.
[00:12:42.747 --> 00:12:43.947]  But I can't do that.
[00:12:44.467 --> 00:12:46.928]  And I'm honored, because life is so short,
[00:12:47.620 --> 00:13:02.825]  Life is so fast, and we're in this fight, and it's coming down on us now, and so I don't have any regrets that I literally work 18 hours a day.
[00:13:03.605 --> 00:13:05.245]  I enjoy it, though, most of the time.
[00:13:06.566 --> 00:13:16.489]  Especially anytime I'm getting burned out, I just turn on the news and watch these evil people on television, and how they think we're a bunch of slaves and a bunch of dumb scum, and they think they're getting won over on us.
[00:13:18.234 --> 00:13:30.428]  Or I read the newspaper and Bush says, I'm against torture and I'm going to put people in prison for torture, that I ordered the torture and we have the orders, but then I'm going to say I'm going to veto a torture law saying you can't torture people to death.
[00:13:30.508 --> 00:13:31.809]  I mean, it only restricts the torture.
[00:13:34.973 --> 00:13:37.175]  It's like giving Jeffrey Dahmer a license.
[00:13:37.195 --> 00:13:38.777]  Well, if he'd had a license, it would have been okay.
[00:13:40.874 --> 00:13:47.279]  When you realize how palpable and how real it is, and when you start tuning out of the enemy transmissions, and let me explain that.
[00:13:47.299 --> 00:13:49.060]  I don't really tune out of the enemy transmissions.
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:50.962]  I've probably got my head more in it than most people.
[00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:53.544]  It's that I do compartmentalize it.
[00:13:53.564 --> 00:14:00.169]  You know, I look at it and I realize what it is, and I hold it at arm's length and I examine it like a snake.
[00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:07.875]  Like a, you know, like if I was a snake handler and I grabbed it with a tool and was holding it at arm's length.
[00:14:09.474 --> 00:14:13.297]  The average person just gives themselves over to it in abandon.
[00:14:13.337 --> 00:14:14.558]  I mean, this is Marketing 101.
[00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:20.163]  That after about a minute and a half watching television, you shift into a dream state.
[00:14:20.683 --> 00:14:23.606]  You ever walk into somebody's house, you come to visit, and they're like, hey, come on in.
[00:14:24.006 --> 00:14:32.433]  And they just kind of have their mouth open, staring blankly at the TV, and you can look at their face and the light of the TV's flashing on it, and they're zombified!
[00:14:32.873 --> 00:14:34.755]  Do not give yourselves over to it!
[00:14:34.795 --> 00:14:36.296]  This life is so short!
[00:14:40.185 --> 00:14:41.906]  You know, that's why I like talk radio.
[00:14:42.027 --> 00:14:43.468]  Not just that I'm on talk radio.
[00:14:43.488 --> 00:14:45.630]  Obviously I got in talk radio because I like talk radio.
[00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:54.677]  When you're out driving, or you're out cleaning the garage out, or you're working in the garden, or you're on a hike.
[00:14:55.338 --> 00:15:08.589]  You know, back in the day when I had time to go on 15 mile hikes, 20 mile hikes, I would, 80% of the time, listen to the birds tweeting and stuff going on, but I might stick an earbud in my ear and listen to a baseball game while I was hiking.
[00:15:09.423 --> 00:15:12.245]  Especially once I got tired, that would give me more energy as a distraction.
[00:15:13.046 --> 00:15:18.669]  But still, when you listen to the radio, it's not as passive.
[00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:19.750]  You're involved.
[00:15:19.770 --> 00:15:22.212]  You have to image things in your mind.
[00:15:22.512 --> 00:15:23.613]  It's akin to reading.
[00:15:24.053 --> 00:15:26.635]  And it shows that radio builds the intellect.
[00:15:27.322 --> 00:15:30.344]  Radio makes more neuron connections in the brain.
[00:15:31.304 --> 00:15:33.825]  Radio, even more so than reading.
[00:15:33.865 --> 00:15:35.986]  They've got whole statistics and whole research.
[00:15:36.006 --> 00:15:37.507]  A lot of research has been done on this.
[00:15:37.827 --> 00:15:39.028]  Reading is excellent as well.
[00:15:39.048 --> 00:15:40.849]  Television is bad.
[00:15:41.969 --> 00:15:43.030]  By my video, by the way.
[00:15:43.690 --> 00:15:45.411]  No, I mean, people are still going to watch TV.
[00:15:45.531 --> 00:15:47.752]  I go see movies occasionally every few weeks.
[00:15:47.832 --> 00:15:51.654]  It's one pleasure I still might snatch occasionally.
[00:15:53.274 --> 00:15:53.835]  But, no.
[00:15:57.347 --> 00:16:03.769]  When you're sitting there watching TV, it's actually lowering your cognitive development.
[00:16:03.809 --> 00:16:07.931]  It's actually lowering the amount of actual neuron connections.
[00:16:07.951 --> 00:16:11.632]  You know, they say Einstein used 12% of his brain and the average person uses 9%.
[00:16:13.512 --> 00:16:14.553]  Well, that's not really true.
[00:16:15.853 --> 00:16:20.835]  It's like backup server space or extra hard drives because we burn out hard drives, we
[00:16:22.327 --> 00:16:26.494]  Hard drives get corrupted, to use that analogy, the space we've got on our brain.
[00:16:26.874 --> 00:16:34.346]  You know, they'll cut the brain case open, the skull cavity open, on some master
[00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:37.754]  Composer or pianist.
[00:16:38.314 --> 00:16:40.595]  They study people with 180 IQ's brains.
[00:16:41.295 --> 00:16:42.435]  And they've done study after study.
[00:16:42.475 --> 00:16:47.636]  I've even watched documentaries where the person allows their body to be seen when they're killed and when they die.
[00:16:48.096 --> 00:16:50.017]  And they take the skullcap off.
[00:16:50.057 --> 00:16:53.057]  And the brain is like a little grapefruit.
[00:16:53.357 --> 00:16:54.197]  Small grapefruit.
[00:16:54.838 --> 00:16:55.918]  They're 95 years old.
[00:16:55.938 --> 00:16:57.218]  It's shriveled almost to nothing.
[00:16:57.258 --> 00:17:00.059]  But the person, when they died, was bouncing off the walls.
[00:17:00.439 --> 00:17:02.479]  You know, just absolute genius level.
[00:17:03.027 --> 00:17:14.737]  But then they'll cut the head open of somebody who's 70 years old and has Alzheimer's, but they led a sedentary life watching television, and the brain hadn't even really shrunk, but they're dumb as dirt.
[00:17:14.757 --> 00:17:16.498]  The brain just turns off!
[00:17:17.879 --> 00:17:21.022]  Look, we continue to learn, and we need to gobble up life.
[00:17:21.062 --> 00:17:24.465]  We need to just greedily enjoy it and love it.
[00:17:25.206 --> 00:17:30.648]  Instead of just living your life, the average person watches over four hours of TV.
[00:17:30.828 --> 00:17:33.609]  Folks, I don't watch four hours of TV in a month.
[00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.671]  In fact, on average, it's gotta be, I might watch four hours in every two months.
[00:17:39.791 --> 00:17:40.852]  I mean, I don't watch it.
[00:17:41.292 --> 00:17:42.592]  My family doesn't watch it.
[00:17:43.573 --> 00:17:45.093]  That is my wife and children.
[00:17:48.094 --> 00:17:49.875]  My mother uses TV as radio.
[00:17:49.915 --> 00:17:54.757]  She never looks at it, but she has it on the background, the news on, but that's still dangerous.
[00:17:57.799 --> 00:17:59.120]  And look, I'm not up here preaching.
[00:17:59.180 --> 00:18:01.061]  It's just life is so fun.
[00:18:01.681 --> 00:18:08.225]  And back when I was in high school, I was a very active person, but still I wasn't a tenth as happy as I am now because I didn't watch an hour or two of television a day.
[00:18:08.606 --> 00:18:09.666]  It robs you!
[00:18:09.686 --> 00:18:11.888]  What is it?
[00:18:11.928 --> 00:18:15.290]  The average person by the time they die watches like eight years of television?
[00:18:17.131 --> 00:18:18.652]  Eight years of television?
[00:18:18.692 --> 00:18:23.595]  I mean, eight years of your life watching that idiot box!
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:29.403]  Or as you listen to talk radio, I say purple dinosaur, you're now imaging a purple dinosaur.
[00:18:29.984 --> 00:18:31.725]  I say, you know, Mount St.
[00:18:31.765 --> 00:18:34.767]  Helens erupting, you now are imaging Mount St.
[00:18:34.807 --> 00:18:35.487]  Helens erupting.
[00:18:35.507 --> 00:18:40.330]  That is an active action, a brain-boosting activity.
[00:18:43.432 --> 00:18:50.397]  Now, that's why they don't like talk radio, and they've taken it over with a bunch of spewing, pewing, moiling neocons.
[00:18:52.262 --> 00:18:54.905]  But radio is an amazing tool.
[00:18:55.846 --> 00:19:00.250]  And regardless, even if they're spewing propaganda, it's still better to listen to that than watch TV.
[00:19:01.331 --> 00:19:04.534]  And this is not some assault, you know, on TV because I'm going to talk radio, folks.
[00:19:05.135 --> 00:19:07.437]  It's really because the studies and the statistics show that.
[00:19:07.758 --> 00:19:11.301]  And I have no idea why I've gotten off into a rant about television when I have all this news.
[00:19:11.361 --> 00:19:13.924]  It's just that enjoy life.
[00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:18.614]  Go scuba diving.
[00:19:18.674 --> 00:19:19.515]  Go for a hike.
[00:19:19.575 --> 00:19:22.336]  If you've got children, spend more time with them.
[00:19:23.056 --> 00:19:28.479]  I mean, if you don't educate them and train them and put values into them, the government's going to do it.
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:39.845]  If you don't teach them the beauty of thinking and being involved and questioning, then they'll be taught not to.
[00:19:39.865 --> 00:19:43.887]  Alright, I've done my preaching.
[00:19:45.137 --> 00:19:50.023]  We'll cover a few key news items when we get back, and then we'll play part of this Ron Paul interview, only a segment.
[00:19:50.704 --> 00:19:52.105]  And then we'll open the phones up at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:52.125 --> 00:19:52.706]  You see, radio is active.
[00:19:52.726 --> 00:19:53.647]  It's proactive here at Paul.
[00:20:02.483 --> 00:20:05.624]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.

[00:21:35.779 --> 00:21:37.761]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.

[00:23:02.941 --> 00:23:08.266]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[00:23:08.586 --> 00:23:13.851]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[00:23:14.291 --> 00:23:17.294]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[00:24:06.368 --> 00:24:08.290]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.770 --> 00:24:11.512]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[00:24:15.151 --> 00:24:18.813]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:24:20.715 --> 00:24:22.236]  I'm just amazed by life.
[00:24:22.316 --> 00:24:26.118]  I mean, to walk outside, we have these big red ants in Texas.
[00:24:27.019 --> 00:24:38.886]  And as a child, and still as an adult, I can just sit there for like 30 minutes and watch these little ants, they're actually big ants, you know, carrying a seed ten times their weight on their back with their mandibles.
[00:24:40.959 --> 00:24:41.619]  We're good to go.
[00:25:01.474 --> 00:25:09.719]  And see, I'm a weirdo because I want to watch real things, little biochemical machines that God designed, moving a rock out of the way.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:14.142]  To greedily bring down this entire grasshopper.
[00:25:17.324 --> 00:25:20.886]  And I just marvel at everything.
[00:25:21.146 --> 00:25:24.008]  And I just am so thankful to be alive.
[00:25:24.168 --> 00:25:25.349]  It's so amazing.
[00:25:25.996 --> 00:25:28.357]  And I'm so thankful that I have a moral compass.
[00:25:28.397 --> 00:25:29.737]  Not that I'm even the best person in the world.
[00:25:30.137 --> 00:25:33.358]  I'm so thankful that somehow I kept my conscience.
[00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:37.560]  I'm so thankful that I learned about the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:25:38.060 --> 00:25:41.541]  I'm so thankful that I know martial law is being set up in America.
[00:25:44.082 --> 00:25:44.902]  So we can fight it.
[00:25:46.063 --> 00:25:47.623]  I'm so thankful I'm not in the dark.
[00:25:47.643 --> 00:25:49.684]  You know, I hear commercials on TV and radio and they're like,
[00:25:50.856 --> 00:25:54.958]  You know, come to our club and forget about reality, and then the next day it comes on.
[00:25:55.398 --> 00:25:58.239]  Things getting down, bummed out, come buy a new car.
[00:25:58.259 --> 00:25:59.840]  You're not going to find happiness with that.
[00:26:00.460 --> 00:26:02.221]  At the bar, buying a new car.
[00:26:02.241 --> 00:26:11.805]  I'm not saying a new car is bad, folks, but if getting a new car is so you'll have a fancy new car, and it's some type of religious reason, like you worship the car, then it's the wrong reason.
[00:26:12.285 --> 00:26:14.206]  Again, it gets back to priorities.
[00:26:16.207 --> 00:26:18.128]  Getting our priorities straight.
[00:26:18.996 --> 00:26:20.757]  You know, think about your family line.
[00:26:20.937 --> 00:26:24.839]  All the connections going back thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of years.
[00:26:26.419 --> 00:26:28.360]  And all the men and women that struggled.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:29.901]  All the wars they were in.
[00:26:30.021 --> 00:26:31.582]  All the raids they endured.
[00:26:31.602 --> 00:26:33.102]  You know, going back to ancient villages.
[00:26:33.182 --> 00:26:34.763]  Whether it was in Africa or Germania.
[00:26:36.283 --> 00:26:52.634]  Think about our ancestors coming over in rat-infested, tiny, hundred-foot-long sail ships, and being in giant storms on fifty-foot waves, and women giving birth in the holds of ships, and the Black Plague.
[00:26:54.495 --> 00:27:05.803]  You know, what happened in America to black slaves being brought over in slave ships and in great white tiger sharks following the ships, eating their bodies as they threw them overboard.
[00:27:05.863 --> 00:27:15.770]  And just all the toil and war and suffering, but also exaltation and resistance and rebellions against tyranny and everything we are as a species.
[00:27:16.151 --> 00:27:22.135]  You know, so many adults I know go, I got a big house, I make lots of money, I owe this system, I owe the government.
[00:27:24.102 --> 00:27:27.164]  You've actually, instead of thanking God, you thank the government.
[00:27:27.904 --> 00:27:33.148]  I mean, literally, a lot of successful people think that they're part of the system and they owe this system something.
[00:27:33.788 --> 00:27:34.769]  Well, I've done good.
[00:27:34.809 --> 00:27:36.510]  I mean, how can I criticize what's happening?
[00:27:36.910 --> 00:27:39.592]  Don't you understand the globalists are parasites?
[00:27:39.812 --> 00:27:52.360]  We were so big and so rich and so dynamic and so intelligent and so in action, taking action, so involved in the dynamic struggle of humanity and life
[00:27:53.129 --> 00:28:03.196]  And this animating contest that these parasites have used us as an engine to take over the planet, and they're now script mining everything psychologically, spiritually, and economically?
[00:28:03.216 --> 00:28:11.022]  You know, the curtain's lowering on this country, and the politicians do stand up there and take credit for all this.
[00:28:11.483 --> 00:28:18.808]  When our grandfathers and grandmothers and their grandparents and their grandparents and the people at Lexington and Concord and Trenton
[00:28:20.091 --> 00:28:33.626]  And Bunker Hill and all of it when they spilt their guts for us and a bunch of inbred drug addict pieces of trash sit up there in the White House and take credit for all this and you let them take credit for this?
[00:28:35.749 --> 00:28:37.411]  When they're destroying this?
[00:28:37.631 --> 00:28:38.953]  They're overturning this?
[00:28:39.313 --> 00:28:40.795]  They're annihilating this?
[00:28:43.163 --> 00:28:45.585]  They're eating through it, swarming through it like a cancer.
[00:28:45.825 --> 00:28:47.146]  I've used this analogy many times.
[00:28:47.507 --> 00:28:50.990]  The globalists are a cancer, and they say survival of the fittest, social Darwinism.
[00:28:51.170 --> 00:28:53.392]  Well, since we're taking over, that gives us a right to rule.
[00:28:53.612 --> 00:29:00.137]  Well, since we're ruthless and we'll kill anybody and everybody, because we're more evil than the evilest thing you can imagine, well, that gives us a right to rule.
[00:29:00.217 --> 00:29:00.818]  No, it doesn't!
[00:29:01.038 --> 00:29:02.299]  You're a disease!
[00:29:02.499 --> 00:29:03.600]  You're a pathogen!
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:04.601]  You're a poison!
[00:29:05.754 --> 00:29:07.475]  There's nothing survival of the fittest.
[00:29:07.956 --> 00:29:12.499]  Cyanide isn't superior to the human mind and the human body and this incredible machine.
[00:29:12.539 --> 00:29:13.800]  It's just a simple poison.
[00:29:15.041 --> 00:29:17.303]  But you put it into the body, it will kill the body.
[00:29:17.863 --> 00:29:25.929]  So, just because you're a capsule of cyanide and you're killing humanity, doesn't mean you're somehow wonderful or godlike, you pieces of trash!
[00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.470]  I indict you!
[00:29:27.791 --> 00:29:30.753]  The whole universe indicts you as a plague!
[00:29:31.517 --> 00:29:33.838]  As a plague on God's creation!
[00:29:34.238 --> 00:29:35.699]  And we're gonna cut you out!
[00:29:36.119 --> 00:29:37.420]  And it's gonna be painful!
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.101]  But here comes the scalpel!
[00:29:39.261 --> 00:29:40.342]  So you get ready!
[00:29:40.662 --> 00:29:41.662]  You're going down!
[00:29:41.722 --> 00:29:43.723]  We're gonna burn you out!
[00:29:43.823 --> 00:29:44.484]  You got that?
[00:29:44.744 --> 00:29:46.485]  God's gonna cauterize you!
[00:29:46.705 --> 00:29:47.805]  We're gonna burn!
[00:29:48.045 --> 00:29:49.146]  You're gonna burn!
[00:29:49.346 --> 00:29:50.487]  Get ready to burn!
[00:29:52.047 --> 00:29:53.008]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.448 --> 00:29:55.049]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.969 --> 00:29:58.651]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:06.847 --> 00:30:12.231]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:30:12.471 --> 00:30:13.992]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:30:14.032 --> 00:30:16.273]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:30:16.474 --> 00:30:20.016]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:30:20.336 --> 00:30:22.358]  And they can do it without due process.

[00:31:06.072 --> 00:31:06.572]  are located?

[00:32:01.844 --> 00:32:03.366]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:32:03.526 --> 00:32:04.668]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:04.848 --> 00:32:08.273]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:08.373 --> 00:32:08.814]  Phenol!
[00:32:09.114 --> 00:32:16.203]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:16.704 --> 00:32:20.627]  ETA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:20.727 --> 00:32:21.187]  Fragrance?
[00:32:21.547 --> 00:32:26.311]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:26.451 --> 00:32:31.154]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:32:31.374 --> 00:32:33.856]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:32:34.176 --> 00:32:37.579]  Well, like all of the products from the Kalben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:32:37.739 --> 00:32:41.322]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:33:23.604 --> 00:33:27.405]  We are very honored to have Congressman Ron Paul with us for the next 25 minutes.
[00:33:29.102 --> 00:33:30.944]  We appreciate him and his busy schedule.
[00:33:30.984 --> 00:33:33.107]  They're actually lining up some people to run against him.
[00:33:33.127 --> 00:33:37.932]  His 67% election rate is not daunting them.
[00:33:37.952 --> 00:33:42.978]  And when these new electronic voting machines look out, they're going to really support the congressman this year.
[00:33:43.458 --> 00:33:48.264]  That's a message to all the troops out there on the front lines of the fight for this republic.
[00:33:49.801 --> 00:33:53.002]  But, Congressman, first off, thanks for coming on with us.
[00:33:53.362 --> 00:33:54.422]  Oh, good to be with you again.
[00:33:54.782 --> 00:33:56.362]  You bet.
[00:33:56.422 --> 00:33:58.903]  Now they're having to finally send armored vehicles to the border.
[00:33:59.643 --> 00:34:03.784]  There have been 600 deaths in the last eight months on the Texas-Mexico border.
[00:34:03.884 --> 00:34:05.044]  They closed the U.S.
[00:34:05.604 --> 00:34:08.184]  mission because of rocket attacks and machine gun attacks.
[00:34:08.764 --> 00:34:11.085]  As you know, the Laredo is completely shut down.
[00:34:11.165 --> 00:34:12.265]  Laredo is shut down.
[00:34:12.645 --> 00:34:13.665]  Almost no terrorism.
[00:34:14.545 --> 00:34:17.186]  And Bush is just ignoring the entire problem.
[00:34:18.172 --> 00:34:24.577]  Yep, and I imagine he will because he's for the New World Order and you know he's not going to oppose any of these moves.
[00:34:24.897 --> 00:34:46.694]  I was in a high school class just this morning and I talked to the principal and that was one of the main things he wanted to talk to me on a personal level was the burden that the local schools have with illegal immigrants and they have all the federal mandates and it's a real problem to him personally as a teacher and as an administrator and of course he recognized it was a burden for our taxpayers too.
[00:34:48.027 --> 00:34:53.651]  But, I mean, in polls, 80 plus percent of the American people, including the majority of Hispanics, are against these open borders.
[00:34:54.152 --> 00:35:01.077]  Why are the Republicans and Democrats ignoring the mountain of public support to close them and the Constitution demanding it?
[00:35:01.317 --> 00:35:05.440]  Well, I think it's an obsession with this fear of not being politically correct.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.442]  I think that's part of it, and I think some of it is.
[00:35:07.975 --> 00:35:13.418]  Just flat out they think it's practical, pragmatic politics to do this.
[00:35:13.478 --> 00:35:21.943]  You point out that maybe the Hispanics aren't that supportive of open borders, which I agree with you, especially those who are American citizens and got here the honest way.
[00:35:22.524 --> 00:35:28.167]  But they have this notion that if they do anything to restrict immigration,
[00:35:28.706 --> 00:35:34.255]  That Hispanics will never vote for you, and therefore they would lose their vote, and that's the name of the game up there.
[00:35:34.275 --> 00:35:39.845]  It's not to deliberately undermine the Constitution, it's never deliberately to uphold the Constitution.
[00:35:40.436 --> 00:35:43.897]  Everything is designed to maintain or secure political power.
[00:35:44.337 --> 00:35:47.538]  And their interpretation is that this is a benefit.
[00:35:47.618 --> 00:35:54.480]  Now, you and I agree that they're not looking at it right because it's obviously a political liability from our viewpoint.
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:36:04.743]  Well, Rome finally fell and became rotten from within because there were more people from outside the Empire's core than there were that had been born there.
[00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:08.525]  All right, and they believed in welfare at that time, too.
[00:36:08.625 --> 00:36:15.649]  They didn't think that people would have to work, and for a long time the Romans lived off the lands that they conquered.
[00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:26.636]  But they eventually consumed all that they conquered, and they weren't producing anything, which is the tendency that we have these days, because we're not producing as we used to.
[00:36:26.736 --> 00:36:33.460]  So if we don't change our way, we will go the way of Rome, and I see that as rather sad.
[00:36:35.037 --> 00:36:39.825]  Protecting that element that protects all of us economically and politically, and that is personal liberty.
[00:36:40.106 --> 00:36:41.808]  And that would solve all our problems.
[00:36:42.349 --> 00:36:46.576]  Congressman Ron Paul, speaking of politically correct, Myers, this new...
[00:36:47.469 --> 00:36:49.550]  Of this new individual he wants for the Supreme Court.
[00:36:49.610 --> 00:36:53.552]  I mean, a big liberal, anti-gun, pro-open border, pro-abortion.
[00:36:54.013 --> 00:36:59.676]  A lot of conservative commentators are now being forced to admit that Bush is totally betraying the party.
[00:36:59.916 --> 00:37:06.920]  I mean, you said three, four years ago with your neocon speech that, you know, more betrayals happen with Republicans than we have with Democrats.
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.421]  Can you elaborate on that?
[00:37:08.601 --> 00:37:11.182]  Well, I think that's when conservatives let their guard down.
[00:37:11.843 --> 00:37:15.665]  If you see when Reagan was first elected, when the Bushes got in office,
[00:37:16.289 --> 00:37:20.850]  The effort to really fight for our values is diminished.
[00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:22.251]  People say, oh, we're in charge.
[00:37:22.291 --> 00:37:33.353]  And especially this last time, in 2000, we had control of the administration, we had control of the House and the Senate, and therefore the court appointees would all be okay.
[00:37:33.733 --> 00:37:36.054]  And the conservatives just sort of get lackadaisical.
[00:37:36.794 --> 00:37:43.296]  And some of the worst things happen when you get the so-called conservative Republicans in charge from Nixon on down.
[00:37:43.336 --> 00:37:47.658]  You know, some of the terrible things that big government flourishes under Republicans.
[00:37:48.038 --> 00:37:55.421]  But my problem, and those who argue the case for limited government as a Republican, is that, oh, you don't like our president.
[00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:56.661]  You're undermining the president.
[00:37:56.701 --> 00:37:57.541]  You're not loyal.
[00:37:57.581 --> 00:37:59.982]  If you don't support the war, you're unpatriotic.
[00:38:01.803 --> 00:38:04.724]  But I think what is happening right now with this appointment
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:07.120]  Finally, they're starting to wake up.
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:14.442]  They should have been awake years ago, but I think this appointment has all of a sudden galvanized the conservatives to speak out.
[00:38:14.522 --> 00:38:22.944]  Maybe they'll speak out more forcefully against the war as well as the problems with immigration and deal with these appointments as well.
[00:38:23.944 --> 00:38:27.885]  Congressman, it seems like Bush really is living in a bubble.
[00:38:28.025 --> 00:38:30.025]  I mean, he says that he doesn't read the newspapers.
[00:38:30.665 --> 00:38:34.646]  I never believed that, but I think his advisors don't read the newspapers because
[00:38:35.863 --> 00:38:40.605]  Ninety to nine, they vote that they can't torture somebody too much.
[00:38:41.846 --> 00:38:51.230]  And then Bush is sending people to prison through his Pentagon and his JAG generals are sending people to prison for five years for following orders.
[00:38:51.270 --> 00:38:52.690]  We have the Gonzales memos.
[00:38:53.051 --> 00:39:00.134]  And then Bush comes right out and says, yeah, we're not, I'm going to veto any law saying that we can't torture people.
[00:39:00.214 --> 00:39:00.434]  I mean,
[00:39:01.215 --> 00:39:02.936]  It really, it's embarrassing.
[00:39:03.376 --> 00:39:12.861]  You know, it's really hard to believe it's happening right in front of us, whether it's the torturing or whether it's the process of denying habeas corpus to an American citizen.
[00:39:12.881 --> 00:39:17.784]  You say, well, it's only one, two, or three people, but boy, that principle is so significant.
[00:39:18.384 --> 00:39:21.706]  I think it's arrogance, arrogance of power that they have where
[00:39:22.882 --> 00:39:31.266]  Where they themselves are like communists, not in the philosophy completely, but in the sense that they design what is right.
[00:39:31.306 --> 00:39:33.827]  You know, the Communist Party said what was right and wrong.
[00:39:33.867 --> 00:39:35.228]  It wasn't a higher source.
[00:39:35.468 --> 00:39:37.109]  Well, Rove told the New York Times that.
[00:39:37.129 --> 00:39:43.452]  He said, we govern reality by telling you what it is, but if we don't play along, they're just clowns.
[00:39:43.912 --> 00:39:48.274]  Yeah, they want to set these standards and they're absolutely arrogant.
[00:39:48.294 --> 00:39:55.396]  That's why they need to be brought down to their knees, especially people like Roe who have run this show for so long.
[00:39:56.437 --> 00:40:02.079]  This could be a big event pretty soon if Roe gets indicted.
[00:40:02.259 --> 00:40:17.728]  Well, sir, you're a medical doctor, and I respect the fields of medicine and the study of this, but doesn't that sound like delusional behavior when you start saying, I mean, that's almost a medical condition, not just psychiatric, when you start saying, you know, I am the king, I make reality.
[00:40:17.768 --> 00:40:19.770]  I mean, that's like fruitcake land.
[00:40:19.810 --> 00:40:20.490]  That's dangerous.
[00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:22.231]  Well, I think it is.
[00:40:22.251 --> 00:40:24.953]  I think it's borderline thinking.
[00:40:25.633 --> 00:40:29.956]  But I think a lot of politicians are borderline anyway.
[00:40:30.417 --> 00:40:37.461]  But when you get that much power and you're borderline on your thinking and where truth comes from, it's a rather dangerous situation.
[00:40:37.641 --> 00:40:40.824]  And that's why I preach the Constitution.
[00:40:40.864 --> 00:40:42.465]  The Constitution is so important.
[00:40:42.965 --> 00:40:46.988]  A lot of people accuse me, well Ron Paul, all he does is vote his personal beliefs.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:51.523]  Well, in a way that's true, but my personal belief is that you should follow the rule of law.
[00:40:51.543 --> 00:40:54.986]  But the rule of law is more important to me than anything else.
[00:40:55.006 --> 00:41:00.389]  That doesn't mean that we shouldn't change our laws and we shouldn't change our Constitution if need be.
[00:41:00.830 --> 00:41:03.672]  It's just that we ought to obey the rule of law.
[00:41:04.272 --> 00:41:09.736]  And so sometimes I have to go against my desires on some legislation.
[00:41:09.756 --> 00:41:13.019]  You know, they'll have a piece of federal legislation that sounds pretty good to me.
[00:41:13.799 --> 00:41:16.542]  Uh, you know, maybe on liability reform or something like this.
[00:41:16.723 --> 00:41:18.364]  But I don't have the authority to do this.
[00:41:18.384 --> 00:41:19.225]  That's all I do.
[00:41:19.325 --> 00:41:20.847]  So I'll have to vote against it.
[00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.421]  In order to preserve what I think is important.
[00:41:24.601 --> 00:41:31.983]  You're talking about the 10th Amendment because the road to hell is paved with good intentions and if we build a centralized system it's going to be abused.
[00:41:32.103 --> 00:41:33.023]  That's right.
[00:41:34.323 --> 00:41:44.766]  I think what has happened over the last hundred years plus was that after they passed the 14th Amendment, not immediately but as time has evolved,
[00:41:45.526 --> 00:41:51.410]  The courts have ruled that the 14th Amendment repealed the 9th and the 10th Amendment, so that is totally ignored.
[00:41:51.830 --> 00:42:01.876]  If they want to do something, whether they're conservatives or liberals in Washington, they'll refer frequently to the General Welfare Clause or the Interstate Commerce Clause or the 14th Amendment.
[00:42:01.916 --> 00:42:07.139]  Conservatives like to use the 14th Amendment and say, oh, we have the authority to do this.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:10.982]  What are the Democrats saying about Bush right now?
[00:42:11.042 --> 00:42:14.324]  I mean, double the growth rate of government, what it was with Clinton.
[00:42:14.784 --> 00:42:20.308]  Every major great society program ballooning, metastasizing, wildly blooming.
[00:42:20.668 --> 00:42:29.133]  And then meanwhile, these judges he's appointing left and right are, to use the false left-right spectrum, are left of Hillary Clinton.
[00:42:29.894 --> 00:42:32.436]  I mean, the Democrats, I've told Democrats that hate Bush.
[00:42:32.476 --> 00:42:36.198]  If you love your party's views, then you should really know what the policies are.
[00:42:36.238 --> 00:42:37.599]  You should like Bush, not hate him.
[00:42:37.859 --> 00:42:43.452]  Well, I think they do, and I think they would like calm delay to hang around and all these problems to exist.
[00:42:44.269 --> 00:42:46.390]  That Carr-Rowe remains a punching bag.
[00:42:46.810 --> 00:42:55.112]  But, you know, they do complain a bit, and they'll even talk about the Constitution and states' rights and balanced budgets and cutting back.
[00:42:55.552 --> 00:42:57.193]  But no, they're not believable.
[00:42:57.473 --> 00:43:02.114]  You know, who's going to believe that Democrats are really serious about fiscal conservatism?
[00:43:03.635 --> 00:43:10.557]  But they talk that way, and they pretend that they're concerned, but they really aren't.
[00:43:11.130 --> 00:43:15.554]  And they just, you know, are the problem as much as anything.
[00:43:15.594 --> 00:43:18.137]  They were the ones that helped Bush pass the Patriot Act.
[00:43:18.317 --> 00:43:23.502]  They're the ones who helped Bush pass all this warmongering, neo-con-interventionism.
[00:43:25.016 --> 00:43:26.637]  They offer nothing!
[00:43:26.978 --> 00:43:31.542]  Although on occasion, their rhetoric sounds like the old Republicans used to say.
[00:43:31.582 --> 00:43:49.038]  Congressman, do you get the feeling I get, and if you don't, I mean obviously tell us, but they passed the National ID Card Real ID Act, they're pushing for open borders, they passed the New Freedom Initiative for forced psychological testing and drugging, just everything, you know, Bush up there saying torture's good,
[00:43:49.967 --> 00:43:53.788]  All of this, hey, let's get rid of Posse Common Tautus, let's have troops run your life.
[00:43:54.208 --> 00:44:04.992]  I mean, it seems like the freight train is going down a steeper and steeper grade, and no one's in control, and it just seems like there's a wild corporate orgy of looting going on.
[00:44:05.792 --> 00:44:15.035]  You know, it's real easy to blame Congress and the President, and they deserve a lot of blame, but to me it's so strange that the President
[00:44:15.854 --> 00:44:18.435]  Can make these proposals, and they're even plausible.
[00:44:18.535 --> 00:44:20.075]  I mean, they shouldn't even be plausible.
[00:44:20.355 --> 00:44:37.960]  When he talks about martial law, dealing with some epidemic that might come later on to have forced quarantines, doing away with posse comitatus in order to deal with national, uh, national, natural disasters, as well as the potential of, of terrorist acts.
[00:44:39.485 --> 00:44:40.825]  But hardly anybody says anything.
[00:44:41.046 --> 00:44:42.886]  People must be scared to death.
[00:44:42.906 --> 00:44:45.127]  They must say, well, you know, somebody's going to get me.
[00:44:45.147 --> 00:44:47.788]  So therefore, and they have no confidence in themselves.
[00:44:47.968 --> 00:44:50.529]  But Congressman, I mean, you're a veteran yourself.
[00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:51.529]  You're a medical doctor.
[00:44:52.009 --> 00:44:55.531]  I've heard a lot of other medical doctors on air saying that a quarantine's going to do nothing.
[00:44:55.571 --> 00:44:56.711]  You can't quarantine it.
[00:44:57.351 --> 00:44:59.492]  And that this thing's being way overhyped.
[00:44:59.952 --> 00:45:03.593]  And that Rumsfeld, by the way, is tied into the company that's selling this flu pill.
[00:45:03.973 --> 00:45:08.375]  They're going to make at least $4 billion in the next few months, and it's Bush out there
[00:45:09.355 --> 00:45:15.339]  Pushing this entire thing, but I mean, you know, it's we need martial law because of the terrorist threat.
[00:45:15.359 --> 00:45:17.041]  We need martial law because of the hurricane.
[00:45:17.061 --> 00:45:19.562]  We need martial law because of the bird flu.
[00:45:19.602 --> 00:45:20.563]  I mean, it's every day.
[00:45:20.623 --> 00:45:21.544]  It's martial law.
[00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:24.426]  And they have the propaganda machine.
[00:45:24.466 --> 00:45:25.707]  They get the attention.
[00:45:26.167 --> 00:45:31.670]  But it has to be work with the people who have become frightened and scared.
[00:45:31.770 --> 00:45:35.332]  I don't think this could have happened, you know, 150 years ago.
[00:45:35.352 --> 00:45:38.174]  Or, you know, I don't think the people would have been so complacent.
[00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:40.875]  So things are coming together to their benefit.
[00:45:41.335 --> 00:45:45.758]  But I agree, it is the president hyping this and the Rumsfeld.
[00:45:46.638 --> 00:45:53.660]  But it has to be in combination with the people being fearful enough that they will accept the man on the white horse.
[00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:54.641]  You're a medical doctor.
[00:45:54.981 --> 00:45:57.682]  Can you give us your take on this bird flu?
[00:45:58.662 --> 00:46:01.683]  Probably no more of an expert than anybody else.
[00:46:03.495 --> 00:46:23.188]  My first reaction, just with my political and medical background, would be that it's way overly hyped, and to think that they have gone this far with it, without a single case in the whole country, and they're willing to change the law and turn it into a military state.
[00:46:23.708 --> 00:46:25.970]  I mean, that is unbelievable!
[00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:29.652]  But isn't it even more obvious that every week it's some new reason?
[00:46:30.012 --> 00:46:31.653]  Yeah, and I imagine it's going to continue.
[00:46:33.932 --> 00:46:44.495]  They are determined that they're going to have martial law, and people seem to think that coming out of New Orleans, you know, they saw the breakdown of law and order and said, well, it was all those state people, they couldn't take care of the law.
[00:46:44.515 --> 00:46:45.556]  Why do they want martial law?
[00:46:45.576 --> 00:46:51.857]  The people are putting up with it, they're putting up with all the corporate contracts and the scams and all the corruption and the bloated deficit.
[00:46:52.378 --> 00:46:57.379]  I mean, why is this, these corporate interests that control Bush, why are they so obsessed
[00:46:57.939 --> 00:47:07.225]  With having troops on the street corners of America, I mean, Secretary of Defense Cohen in 98 was saying that in the Army Times, that troops on the street corner, you know, that means safety.
[00:47:07.985 --> 00:47:24.995]  I think they're concerned about the remnant, the remnant of those individuals who don't buy into this stuff and think that they should take care of themselves on their own, that they should have their own guns and their own provisions, and they don't want to depend on the government at all, and I think that is a threat to those who want to hold power.
[00:47:26.941 --> 00:47:34.655]  You know the demonstration I think there was some confiscation or threat of confiscation of guns even in New Orleans and certainly the move in
[00:47:35.918 --> 00:47:43.245]  In this country that we're trying to create this new perfect democracy, Iraq, that's one of the things that they want to make sure is that the people don't have guns.
[00:47:43.806 --> 00:47:47.790]  So, uh, they don't want any resistance to their authoritarian rule.
[00:47:48.130 --> 00:47:56.939]  So, talking to Congresswoman Ron Paul here, he's coming to the exact same conclusion that we have in articles we've written and what other people are saying and now in the mainstream newspapers.
[00:47:57.359 --> 00:48:25.353]  We're living in a twilight zone, with the government openly wanting to use the military on us to confiscate our guns, and Congressman, I don't know if you've seen my videos, but I've been to urban warfare drills in Hebron, Maryland, and in California, and in North Carolina, and I'm talking six, seven years ago, where they were training the Marines to take our guns, and they were training domestically, sir, and I have the video, and then now it's being manifest, and people are having trouble dealing with it, but
[00:48:28.423 --> 00:48:29.304]  I mean, where is it going?
[00:48:29.324 --> 00:48:35.408]  Do you think they'll really have the... Well, in some ways it may serve our interests as well.
[00:48:35.668 --> 00:48:38.510]  Because, you know, I complain about the people being too complacent.
[00:48:38.530 --> 00:48:40.512]  I think there is going to be a limit.
[00:48:40.852 --> 00:48:47.457]  I just think that the gun issue is one that they will not win in this country because I think the American people
[00:48:48.107 --> 00:48:48.527]  I don't
[00:49:07.293 --> 00:49:18.026]  Most people know you have a gun in your house, so you could be totally isolated, but you're reasonably safe, safer than you are in the inner city, because in the inner city, you have all the policemen, but there are no guns.
[00:49:18.046 --> 00:49:19.407]  The people don't have any guns.
[00:49:19.427 --> 00:49:20.769]  They've all been taken from them.
[00:49:21.437 --> 00:49:27.600]  So, I think it would be very hard to take the guns, and if they try to, I think our numbers will grow.
[00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:29.440]  And I think that's the same way it is.
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:39.524]  There's a growing number of people who are interested in protecting themselves financially, and they want to hold medals, you know, as the ultimate reserve against paper money.
[00:49:40.105 --> 00:49:42.546]  And I think that they're going to have trouble.
[00:49:42.946 --> 00:49:48.008]  And it's a shame, but I'm afraid it's going in that direction.
[00:49:49.304 --> 00:49:54.287]  Well, you know, a diver who's diving at 500 feet, he gets narcosis.
[00:49:54.787 --> 00:49:59.029]  He gets high from the mixture he's breathing from the tank.
[00:49:59.070 --> 00:50:05.693]  And it seems like people in high places get delusional throughout history on these power trips and think they're invincible.
[00:50:05.713 --> 00:50:06.994]  In fact, it always happens.
[00:50:07.034 --> 00:50:09.295]  Hitler, you know, attacking four countries at the same time.
[00:50:09.936 --> 00:50:13.077]  It seems like, though, we're starting to see that out of Washington itself.
[00:50:13.097 --> 00:50:15.298]  Do you think they're ever going to come back to ground?
[00:50:15.358 --> 00:50:16.959]  Or is it just going to have to collide?
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:27.911]  Let's hope they come to their senses because one day I think these guys are ready to start a war with Iran or they're ready to start a war with Syria or North Korea or China.
[00:50:29.747 --> 00:50:31.048]  They can't possibly do that.
[00:50:31.128 --> 00:50:32.248]  It's so insane.
[00:50:32.569 --> 00:50:33.489]  We don't have the money.
[00:50:33.529 --> 00:50:34.429]  We don't have the troops.
[00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:39.772]  We probably don't even have the ammunition anymore because they consume so much every single day.
[00:50:40.413 --> 00:50:45.355]  But, if they are truly delusional, they just might do something that's totally irrational.
[00:50:45.835 --> 00:50:49.257]  Well, I mean, the top army people told them don't invade Iraq, and they did it.
[00:50:49.517 --> 00:50:50.758]  Sir, I want a quick break.
[00:50:50.778 --> 00:50:51.839]  Just a few minutes on the other side.
[00:50:51.859 --> 00:50:54.540]  I want to talk about where your campaign's going, how folks can support it.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.381]  On the other side, stay with us, Congressman.
[00:51:02.401 --> 00:51:05.323]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:06.003 --> 00:51:07.284]  Alex Jones here, America.

[00:51:32.165 --> 00:51:34.908]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:51:35.209 --> 00:51:38.413]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:51:38.453 --> 00:51:40.295]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:53:38.427 --> 00:53:38.827]  I think so.
[00:54:02.359 --> 00:54:21.354]  Well, I re-aired that interview because I know a lot of you probably missed it yesterday with Ron Paul.
[00:54:21.834 --> 00:54:26.338]  I'm going to have the whole thing posted at PrisonPlanet.com here in the next few hours.
[00:54:27.358 --> 00:54:29.439]  We've written a detailed article about it.
[00:54:29.639 --> 00:54:34.321]  Republican Congressman Slims Bush on militarized police state preparation.
[00:54:34.381 --> 00:54:39.783]  Ron Paul says, indictment story is far more damaging than media is portraying.
[00:54:40.263 --> 00:54:44.144]  Avian flu, martial law provisions aimed at gun confiscations.
[00:54:44.224 --> 00:54:47.446]  And he says he believes it's all going in that direction.
[00:54:48.486 --> 00:54:50.027]  There's no other way to look at it, man.
[00:54:50.047 --> 00:54:50.787]  Let me tell you something.
[00:54:51.427 --> 00:54:56.029]  I've got the Army, I've got the Marines training to take your children from you and put you in a camp.
[00:54:57.168 --> 00:54:58.469]  We're talking Amir Ghaib.
[00:54:59.109 --> 00:55:04.972]  And they'll take the very same pieces of trash that are over there doing that there and bring them over here.
[00:55:04.992 --> 00:55:05.693]  That's their plan.
[00:55:05.733 --> 00:55:07.034]  It's about control.
[00:55:07.574 --> 00:55:09.095]  It's about domination.
[00:55:09.675 --> 00:55:10.576]  And you heard Ron Paul.
[00:55:10.616 --> 00:55:11.956]  I mean, he's a veteran of Vietnam.
[00:55:12.357 --> 00:55:13.177]  Medical doctor.
[00:55:14.458 --> 00:55:16.039]  He was a flight surgeon in Vietnam.
[00:55:17.499 --> 00:55:20.121]  And most conservative member of Congress.
[00:55:21.437 --> 00:55:23.338]  But I know neocons here locally.
[00:55:23.559 --> 00:55:24.439]  I hate him.
[00:55:24.459 --> 00:55:26.240]  I love Bush.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:27.441]  I guess you love Myers.
[00:55:27.481 --> 00:55:28.542]  You love Gonzalez.
[00:55:28.582 --> 00:55:30.423]  You just love the open borders.
[00:55:31.724 --> 00:55:32.545]  Wake up, folks.
[00:55:33.553 --> 00:55:37.314]  We're going to start the next hour and go to Kenneth and John and James and many others.
[00:55:37.354 --> 00:55:39.974]  I'd like to hear you respond to what Ron Paul was just saying.
[00:55:40.134 --> 00:55:41.115]  Pretty big news item.
[00:55:41.135 --> 00:55:49.076]  I hope you'll go to PrisonPlanet.com and get that story and get it out to everybody.
[00:55:49.096 --> 00:55:53.097]  1-800-259-9231 is the total free number to join us on this live Wednesday edition.
[00:55:54.497 --> 00:55:55.618]  And then coming up poll.
[00:55:55.678 --> 00:55:57.158]  Americans want Bush impeached.
[00:55:57.717 --> 00:56:03.658]  Genetically modified crops not only poison other crops, but ruin fields for 15 years.
[00:56:04.319 --> 00:56:06.739]  More on peak oil as a globalist scam.
[00:56:07.719 --> 00:56:14.061]  Schwarzenegger, who stages events and all this, he swore he would not make movies while he was governor.
[00:56:14.841 --> 00:56:18.302]  Now he's signed two deals to do it, but he says, oh, it's while I'm running for governor.
[00:56:19.582 --> 00:56:20.583]  What does that even mean?
[00:56:20.603 --> 00:56:23.043]  He'll still be governor on top of running for governor.
[00:56:24.004 --> 00:56:25.704]  Just amazing lies.
[00:56:26.835 --> 00:56:27.996]  More on the avian flu.
[00:56:29.557 --> 00:56:33.260]  And health officials are now saying outbreak is inevitable and virus would spread.
[00:56:33.340 --> 00:56:34.060]  MSNBC.
[00:56:34.100 --> 00:56:34.260]  Why?
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:35.121]  It's inevitable!
[00:56:35.721 --> 00:56:39.564]  Just like SARS is inevitable and nuclear attack is inevitable.
[00:56:39.664 --> 00:56:40.645]  Going to happen.
[00:56:41.365 --> 00:56:42.286]  By the election.
[00:56:42.326 --> 00:56:42.926]  Doesn't happen.
[00:56:42.946 --> 00:56:51.272]  They never lose credibility and a bunch of phony patriots will run around parroting it for greedy reasons.
[00:56:52.593 --> 00:56:53.334]  Okay, fine.
[00:56:53.374 --> 00:56:54.154]  Knock yourselves out.
[00:56:54.214 --> 00:56:55.335]  Some of us want credibility.
[00:56:56.356 --> 00:56:58.337]  EU says Internet could fall apart.
[00:56:58.397 --> 00:56:59.618]  Again, this is part of Internet 2.
[00:56:59.998 --> 00:57:00.978]  Now they're announcing it.
[00:57:01.938 --> 00:57:03.339]  They're going to start shutting it down.
[00:57:03.359 --> 00:57:04.620]  We're already starting to see that happen.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.981]  And, as usual, people won't know why it's happening.
[00:57:07.581 --> 00:57:09.962]  We've written articles about it two years ago because they admit it.
[00:57:10.262 --> 00:57:12.163]  We have our own policy reports and plans.
[00:57:12.803 --> 00:57:16.044]  Mandela rules Earth with Clinton as deputy out of Newsmax.
[00:57:16.084 --> 00:57:17.025]  Wait till you hear about this.
[00:57:17.685 --> 00:57:20.426]  Yes, it's very interesting and it could be in the cards.
[00:57:20.486 --> 00:57:22.747]  At least Bill Clinton, not Mandela.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:25.600]  We're out of time for this hour.
[00:57:25.660 --> 00:57:39.344]  Just briefly, if you believe in what we're doing, you believe in the message we're spreading, and you want powerful, dynamic, informative, excellent videos, then you need to get Martial Law, The Road to Tyranny, Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement.
[00:57:39.664 --> 00:57:41.904]  I carry a bunch of other books and other videos.
[00:57:42.605 --> 00:57:46.085]  Second Amendment videos to wake up gun grabbers in your area.
[00:57:46.626 --> 00:57:48.846]  Videos about what happened to the USS Liberty.
[00:57:49.246 --> 00:57:51.207]  Jim Tucker's new book on the Bilderberg Group.
[00:57:54.281 --> 00:57:56.662]  13 Family Bloodlines and Illuminati.
[00:57:56.802 --> 00:57:57.503]  I got it all!

[00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:46.781]  Big Brother.
[00:58:46.821 --> 00:58:47.562]  Mainstream media.
[00:58:47.722 --> 00:58:53.487]  Government cover-ups.
[00:58:53.888 --> 00:58:55.009]  You want answers?
[00:58:55.169 --> 00:58:56.910]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.974 --> 00:59:09.596]  He's Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.156 --> 00:59:14.279]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.101 --> 00:59:22.843]  If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator.
[00:59:23.344 --> 00:59:25.765]  Lord Bush, December 18, 2000, CNN.
[00:59:25.925 --> 00:59:29.407]  Ron Paul last hour, telling you they're gearing up for martial law.
[00:59:30.370 --> 00:59:34.553]  No one will enter the New World Order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer.
[00:59:35.093 --> 00:59:38.175]  No one will enter the New Age unless he will take a Luciferian initiation.
[00:59:38.515 --> 00:59:42.397]  David Spangler, Director of Planetary Initiative, United Nations.
[00:59:43.078 --> 00:59:49.541]  A total world population of 250-300 million people, a 95% decline from present levels would be ideal.
[00:59:49.922 --> 00:59:55.445]  Ted Turner, who has five kids, said in an interview with Autobahn Magazine he should step up to the plate first.
[00:59:56.305 --> 00:59:58.927]  Just a few quotes from my book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:59:59.810 --> 01:00:02.731]  Masses of news this hour, just so much information.
[01:00:02.791 --> 01:00:06.552]  Syrian minister questioned by UN, commits suicide.
[01:00:06.572 --> 01:00:08.373]  If you believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[01:00:09.573 --> 01:00:11.134]  A poll, Americans want Bush impeached.
[01:00:11.154 --> 01:00:12.974]  A lot of other news coming up.
[01:00:13.034 --> 01:00:15.515]  More indictment news, more avian flu news.
[01:00:15.555 --> 01:00:16.155]  It's all coming up.
[01:00:16.976 --> 01:00:19.996]  Right now, let's go to Kenneth in Louisiana.
[01:00:20.056 --> 01:00:20.837]  Kenneth, welcome.
[01:00:21.797 --> 01:00:23.758]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:00:23.818 --> 01:00:23.878]  Hi.
[01:00:23.938 --> 01:00:24.618]  I just want to say,
[01:00:25.593 --> 01:00:27.034]  I'm on the totem pole.
[01:00:27.074 --> 01:00:28.875]  I'm probably the lowest of white males.
[01:00:28.895 --> 01:00:31.036]  I'm half Cajun and half Dago.
[01:00:31.576 --> 01:00:34.797]  But I was in New Orleans street preaching the other day.
[01:00:34.817 --> 01:00:37.498]  See, I'm so stupid.
[01:00:37.539 --> 01:00:38.379]  What's a Dago?
[01:00:38.879 --> 01:00:40.380]  A poor Italian.
[01:00:42.301 --> 01:00:43.201]  Man, who cares?
[01:00:44.622 --> 01:00:47.203]  You know, I'm just so far past all that stuff.
[01:00:47.483 --> 01:00:49.404]  Well, let me get to what I'm talking about.
[01:00:49.804 --> 01:00:51.205]  And you're talking about waking up.
[01:00:51.445 --> 01:00:53.866]  I was basically in New Orleans preaching.
[01:00:54.990 --> 01:01:02.378]  Uh, in New Orleans, and, uh, I was basically preaching that white males, do you want your children to be like Eminem or Christina Aguilera?
[01:01:02.958 --> 01:01:05.261]  And, uh, people of other races didn't mind me.
[01:01:05.281 --> 01:01:07.202]  They thought probably I was a regular bigot.
[01:01:07.643 --> 01:01:12.528]  But I had people who were white, you know, throw the middle finger at me, or, uh...
[01:01:12.987 --> 01:01:15.969]  You know, one threatened to beat me up, but thank God.
[01:01:16.009 --> 01:01:20.051]  Well, number one, we don't want the blacks and Hispanics to act like this.
[01:01:20.111 --> 01:01:28.996]  Not even so much Eminem, but big money behind this gangster rap and all of this, when there's actually some hip-hop and stuff that's pretty uplifting.
[01:01:29.316 --> 01:01:34.099]  Why does Sumner Redstone and Viacom promote this culture-killing stuff?
[01:01:34.459 --> 01:01:36.640]  We don't want anybody's children acting like this.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.500]  Well, you're exactly right.
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:54.844]  Listen to this, I go fishing sometimes, you know, it's an upscale marina where we go fishing out of, and you'll see middle class, you know, whole packs of children, you know, of young girls acting like prostitutes.
[01:01:55.485 --> 01:01:57.965]  I mean, the society is unraveling.
[01:02:00.106 --> 01:02:00.426]  Are you there?
[01:02:00.706 --> 01:02:03.647]  Yeah, I'm there, and that's where we've got to come in at.
[01:02:03.987 --> 01:02:05.007]  And what a passion
[01:02:05.789 --> 01:02:08.652]  We've got to love the truth and hate what is evil.
[01:02:09.172 --> 01:02:11.774]  And that's what's lacking probably in our churches today.
[01:02:12.775 --> 01:02:20.742]  Well, yeah, it's been said, don't try to keep your children from, you know, when they're 12, dressing like a whore and dancing like a whore and all over the place.
[01:02:20.802 --> 01:02:22.964]  And, oh, you just don't want them to have fun.
[01:02:23.064 --> 01:02:23.404]  No.
[01:02:24.265 --> 01:02:26.026]  We don't want our children to be kidnapped.
[01:02:26.107 --> 01:02:28.669]  We don't want them to be hit on by 18-year-old men.
[01:02:28.929 --> 01:02:30.110]  We want them to be innocent.
[01:02:30.786 --> 01:02:35.971]  And how adults just let their boys and girls watch this trash, I'll never know.
[01:02:35.991 --> 01:02:44.920]  But if you explain to a young person, hey, that stuff isn't cool, that's designed by the government to enslave you, then the kids will rebel against the government.
[01:02:45.120 --> 01:02:45.801]  But if you go, that's...
[01:02:46.221 --> 01:02:47.041]  Too old for you.
[01:02:47.081 --> 01:02:48.382]  That's too cool for you.
[01:02:48.602 --> 01:02:51.423]  When you're older... See, parents go about this from the wrong angle.
[01:02:51.724 --> 01:03:00.347]  You explain to a 12-year-old that the government wants them to take heroin and cocaine, and they want them to start by smoking marijuana, and that they want to put them in a prison to work as slaves.
[01:03:00.627 --> 01:03:01.668]  They'll never smoke it.
[01:03:02.068 --> 01:03:03.128]  They'll never snort it.
[01:03:03.709 --> 01:03:05.570]  Let me tell you, that's how you talk to the young people.
[01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:06.110]  Yeah.
[01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:08.771]  Now, you wanna... You gotta listen to me, you little punk!
[01:03:09.545 --> 01:03:11.166]  You don't let the enemy get you!
[01:03:11.306 --> 01:03:13.827]  And you take them down, you let them see the juvenile hall.
[01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:21.050]  And you ask them and they'll let your child get a tour of maybe some of the kids that are in the mental institution who had bad trips on drugs.
[01:03:21.511 --> 01:03:23.492]  And then they're never gonna use that trash!
[01:03:23.852 --> 01:03:24.692]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:03:25.032 --> 01:03:28.234]  Yeah, you told us to comment about Ron Paul to give a comment.
[01:03:28.334 --> 01:03:30.615]  Yeah, stay there, I'll let you comment on it.
[01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:34.577]  I get a little bit angry, folks, when I talk about drugs.
[01:03:34.917 --> 01:03:37.178]  Let me tell you something, drugs aren't cool, young people.
[01:03:38.385 --> 01:03:40.829]  You buy them, they go right into George Bush's pocket.
[01:03:41.069 --> 01:03:45.736]  Whether you buy Ritalin, Prozac, or cocaine, it all goes the same place.
[01:03:46.517 --> 01:03:47.298]  Document it.
[01:03:47.758 --> 01:03:49.501]  Stop using their trash.
[01:03:54.787 --> 01:03:57.668]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.908 --> 01:03:59.488]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.829 --> 01:04:04.510]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:11.572]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:04:11.912 --> 01:04:13.894]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:04:14.094 --> 01:04:16.937]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:04:17.037 --> 01:04:21.701]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:26.305]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:26.545 --> 01:04:33.752]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:34.032 --> 01:04:36.434]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:04:55.504 --> 01:04:56.545]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.865 --> 01:04:59.646]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.926 --> 01:05:04.069]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:04.489 --> 01:05:05.329]  So what do you do?
[01:05:05.649 --> 01:05:10.212]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:10.692 --> 01:05:12.834]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:13.314 --> 01:05:14.215]  Sheltering in Place!
[01:05:14.616 --> 01:05:18.339]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[01:05:18.639 --> 01:05:28.027]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:28.067 --> 01:05:28.447]  government.

[01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:56.780]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:02.164]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife-in-the-back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[01:06:02.304 --> 01:06:03.685]  But now, we don't have to.
[01:06:03.965 --> 01:06:12.131]  This sacro wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[01:06:12.471 --> 01:06:16.494]  Simply lie on your back with the sacro wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[01:06:16.754 --> 01:06:17.875]  You can actually feel many
[01:06:17.875 --> 01:06:19.496]  Many of these aches and pains just go away.
[01:06:19.896 --> 01:06:23.437]  Use the Sacro wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.

[01:06:58.201 --> 01:06:58.841]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.521 --> 01:07:00.581]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.282 --> 01:07:02.382]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.062 --> 01:07:03.862]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.623 --> 01:07:05.483]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.523 --> 01:07:09.864]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.364 --> 01:07:14.486]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:15.946 --> 01:07:21.168]  Let me just say this about the Phoney Drug War, and then we'll go to Kenneth and John and James and James and Randy.
[01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:24.162]  Many, many other people that are patiently holding.
[01:07:24.202 --> 01:07:32.111]  We're now 1 hour 8 minutes and 33 seconds into the second hour of worldwide transmission against tyranny and the New World Order slave grid.
[01:07:33.532 --> 01:07:34.894]  This is historical fact.
[01:07:35.394 --> 01:07:40.860]  I've even worked and consulted on a major drug war film that's being done right now and being completed to air in Europe.
[01:07:41.461 --> 01:07:42.522]  Too hardcore to air here.
[01:07:44.170 --> 01:08:01.385]  That the exact same companies that brought in the heroin and cocaine and then had almost total monopolies over it when it was legal until the mid and late twenties in this country, the exact same families are the families that run Skull and Bones.
[01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:05.548]  In fact, the Russell Trust with Opium Money founded that.
[01:08:05.588 --> 01:08:07.730]  Even MSNBC's got an article about that.
[01:08:09.051 --> 01:08:12.614]  And when a bunch of other companies broke the British East India Company's monopolies,
[01:08:13.570 --> 01:08:14.470]  And through their U.S.
[01:08:14.490 --> 01:08:22.053]  Directors, the Russells and others, they simply made it illegal.
[01:08:23.273 --> 01:08:28.355]  And they had several different individuals with the federal departments and other groups travel the country
[01:08:29.033 --> 01:08:35.137]  Demonizing drugs, saying marijuana would make you kill hundreds of people, turn you into a literal werewolf.
[01:08:35.177 --> 01:08:37.638]  They made scores of films about it.
[01:08:37.738 --> 01:08:43.301]  Westerns, where the nice guy takes one hit of marijuana and he goes, let's start murdering and murdering people.
[01:08:43.321 --> 01:08:46.163]  I mean, they're really hilarious if they weren't taken so seriously.
[01:08:46.203 --> 01:08:49.965]  People were very naive back then, very trusting of this new media.
[01:08:52.552 --> 01:09:07.555]  And they then demonized heroin and cocaine, which were addictive, and you had large sections of society, still very small minorities, but millions of people, who were drinking Coca-Cola several times a day with large doses of cocaine in it.
[01:09:08.955 --> 01:09:09.595]  Quite a pepper.
[01:09:10.595 --> 01:09:11.776]  Dr. Pepper had it.
[01:09:11.816 --> 01:09:12.996]  Mmm, be a pepper, you know.
[01:09:14.076 --> 01:09:17.937]  At, what, ten, two, and four, three times a day to boost you.
[01:09:17.997 --> 01:09:19.257]  Dr. Pepper, be a pepper.
[01:09:20.638 --> 01:09:21.879]  Wouldn't you like to be a pepper, too?
[01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:23.080]  You're certainly going to get some pep.
[01:09:23.300 --> 01:09:29.565]  And the other lottoms and other snake oils and the chief ingredients were cocaine or heroin or opium.
[01:09:30.846 --> 01:09:33.948]  But folks certainly went for the heroin brand over the opium brand.
[01:09:34.388 --> 01:09:41.153]  Lottoms started not being as popular as folks would get the opium and turn it into heroin at least eight times what eight times more powerful.
[01:09:42.854 --> 01:09:44.916]  Heroin, of course, invented at the end of the Civil War.
[01:09:44.936 --> 01:09:47.798]  They said, man, this gets people right off opium.
[01:09:48.385 --> 01:09:50.706]  It was invented to end opium addiction.
[01:09:51.046 --> 01:09:52.587]  Yeah, they don't want the opium anymore!
[01:09:53.888 --> 01:09:57.229]  It's like, uh, you're worried about smashing your thumb with a hammer.
[01:09:57.269 --> 01:09:59.570]  Here, let's just hit you in the head with it ten times.
[01:09:59.590 --> 01:10:01.151]  You won't be worried about your thumb anymore.
[01:10:01.852 --> 01:10:04.533]  But, um, another lame analogy, folks.
[01:10:06.334 --> 01:10:07.654]  From, um, you know, where?
[01:10:07.694 --> 01:10:08.395]  From my brain.
[01:10:08.435 --> 01:10:12.937]  But, um, openly, they figured it out.
[01:10:13.863 --> 01:10:22.929]  By making it illegal, they could then use the police and the FBI and the state police to go after anybody that shipped it in who wasn't playing ball with the big boys.
[01:10:23.749 --> 01:10:25.490]  Same thing with alcohol prohibition.
[01:10:26.151 --> 01:10:36.117]  Openly, it was all the big mayors and the mafia dons and the corrupt governors literally making hundreds of millions of dollars apiece in the nine years of prohibition.
[01:10:36.137 --> 01:10:37.458]  Alcoholism tripled.
[01:10:37.838 --> 01:10:39.439]  Alcohol became much cooler.
[01:10:39.519 --> 01:10:40.940]  Bars actually spread.
[01:10:42.290 --> 01:10:52.627]  And just as you had a tripling in alcoholism, there was almost a quadrupling in alcohol poisoning because of bad processes and bathtub gin.
[01:10:54.412 --> 01:11:01.375]  And it was well known they wouldn't raid the big speakeasies, they'd raid the small ones that weren't paying their cut or weren't the big boys.
[01:11:01.975 --> 01:11:03.816]  They wouldn't rob the big breweries.
[01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:05.757]  They wouldn't rob the big distilleries.
[01:11:06.397 --> 01:11:09.458]  They would simply go after those that weren't paying their cut.
[01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:11.319]  So, this is a business model.
[01:11:11.579 --> 01:11:13.940]  Hey, people are bringing in heroin and cocaine.
[01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:16.001]  Hey, we're losing our monopoly.
[01:11:16.061 --> 01:11:17.041]  Well, what are we going to do?
[01:11:17.942 --> 01:11:18.982]  Artificial scarcity.
[01:11:19.002 --> 01:11:19.802]  We'll make it illegal.
[01:11:20.843 --> 01:11:23.244]  And even better, we'll then own the prisons
[01:11:24.136 --> 01:11:29.377]  And, uh, run the prisons, and then we'll put everybody's kids in it who think it's cool when the cops catch them.
[01:11:29.637 --> 01:11:31.917]  We'll give people life in prison.
[01:11:32.678 --> 01:11:34.138]  They started in the 30's and 40's.
[01:11:34.598 --> 01:11:36.278]  Life in prison for cocaine.
[01:11:36.298 --> 01:11:39.019]  50 years for marijuana.
[01:11:39.079 --> 01:11:39.899]  First offense.
[01:11:41.579 --> 01:11:42.139]  50 years!
[01:11:42.899 --> 01:11:51.101]  And boy, they'd keep you in there, and now today, there are almost 3 million people in these 7 million that are behind bars or in the system.
[01:11:51.441 --> 01:11:52.701]  Almost 3 million of those
[01:11:53.624 --> 01:11:54.644]  Just Department's own numbers.
[01:11:55.064 --> 01:11:59.546]  In private prisons, for 20 cents an hour on average, taking your jobs.
[01:11:59.946 --> 01:12:06.027]  But you'll sit there on welfare, you'll sit there on unemployment, can't get a job, or you'll work two jobs bagging groceries.
[01:12:06.067 --> 01:12:22.672]  I know a lot of people with degrees bagging groceries, but they love the drug war, and they love the fact they're not just competing against a billion, 350 million Chinese, or a billion, uh, 50 million plus, uh, it's over a billion Indians, almost, what, a billion, 100 million now.
[01:12:25.211 --> 01:12:29.473]  No, you'll compete against three million people in your own country, you fools!
[01:12:29.533 --> 01:12:42.959]  And I mean, I hate to talk to you like that, but I get your emails, I get your occasional calls, you walk over to me, you saunter over arrogantly and make a little comment to me when I'm in the grocery store line and I just want to throw up on you.
[01:12:43.759 --> 01:12:44.720]  You're dumber than dirt.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:49.562]  I know you're giggling right now, you like being stupid, you think it's all real funny.
[01:12:49.942 --> 01:12:50.662]  It's not funny.
[01:12:51.122 --> 01:12:54.584]  I don't like heroin, I don't like cocaine, and I don't like marijuana, quite frankly.
[01:12:55.797 --> 01:13:08.065]  I mean, maybe back in George Washington's day when he smoked it, and it was for stomach aches and headaches, and it's in the annals, he even grew, not just the rope hemp, but the type that, you know, got you high, that, you know, it was an old remedy.
[01:13:08.085 --> 01:13:12.027]  People weren't constantly smoking until they were laid out on the floor, unable to walk.
[01:13:12.648 --> 01:13:19.752]  The marijuana now, folks, is so strong, I mean, a lot of it will just, you can't even hardly get up off the couch, I'm told, of the people that smoke it.
[01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:25.204]  And yes, let's just be honest, I smoked some of it in high school and college and couldn't stand it.
[01:13:25.224 --> 01:13:32.547]  Every time I smoked it, the stuff was so powerful that I just sat there paranoid, sitting on the couch, couldn't wait until it was over.
[01:13:34.348 --> 01:13:36.209]  I probably smoked pot, let me think.
[01:13:36.669 --> 01:13:39.490]  Not that many times, maybe as many as you can count up on my hands.
[01:13:40.581 --> 01:13:46.203]  And, uh, maybe once that I get the giggles and, you know, eat a pizza and supposedly what happens to other people.
[01:13:46.243 --> 01:13:50.325]  But, you know, the point here is that these drugs are really bad.
[01:13:50.966 --> 01:13:56.728]  Ritalin, Prozac, stuff like that is just many times worse.
[01:13:56.768 --> 01:13:59.669]  The molecules of themselves are deadly poison.
[01:14:00.189 --> 01:14:01.650]  Just the chemical itself is poison.
[01:14:02.410 --> 01:14:03.631]  You know, the effect on your body.
[01:14:05.493 --> 01:14:08.494]  And young people out there, you think it's so cool.
[01:14:08.834 --> 01:14:21.579]  Every time I mention that drugs aren't cool and that the counterculture isn't cool, I get emails saying, hey man, we're a revolutionary movement.
[01:14:21.599 --> 01:14:23.539]  You know, like you're rebelling when you smoke pot.
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:25.480]  Like you're defeating the New World Order.
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:30.662]  The New World Order, you're correct in saying, does not like marijuana because it's not a crop they control.
[01:14:32.463 --> 01:14:37.087]  Joe, that's why they really wage war against it, because it is grown so many places.
[01:14:37.567 --> 01:14:45.234]  But they do love it in that they get lots of ranches and lots of homes and lots of houses and get to steal lots of property of some zip-faced punk.
[01:14:46.054 --> 01:14:56.163]  You know, has a half pound of it in their house, selling dope out of the back bedroom, and mommy doesn't know about it because she's working two jobs and, you know, divorced and busy going out with her beau every night.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:06.802]  And you know, you're at home selling marijuana out the back door, and then maybe you start selling ecstasy, and boom, the cops hit you and take mommy's house that she got in the divorce five years ago.
[01:15:07.482 --> 01:15:08.102]  Stop it!
[01:15:10.002 --> 01:15:13.323]  Life is not smoking dope, drooling in front of the television.
[01:15:14.043 --> 01:15:16.123]  Life is not snorting cocaine.
[01:15:16.603 --> 01:15:18.004]  Life is not doing that.
[01:15:20.664 --> 01:15:23.745]  And it diminishes your consciousness.
[01:15:23.785 --> 01:15:25.145]  It diminishes your intellect.
[01:15:25.979 --> 01:15:28.260]  And of course I'm against you going to prison for it.
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.682]  Of course I'm against you being pulled over and controlled for it.
[01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:35.764]  I'm against knowing the fact the SWAT team could bust in on me and I can't stand the stuff.
[01:15:36.664 --> 01:15:43.287]  It's a war, another phony war, they control, they run, just like terrorism or poverty or any of it.
[01:15:45.008 --> 01:15:46.709]  But that doesn't mean I condone it.
[01:15:48.530 --> 01:15:53.592]  And so, let me tell you, you talk to young people like that and you explain to them that it is a trap.
[01:15:54.426 --> 01:16:00.930]  That the so-called counterculture was created by this government as an ad campaign, then they won't get on to it.
[01:16:00.990 --> 01:16:03.092]  Or if they do get on to it, they'll get off of it pretty quick.
[01:16:03.632 --> 01:16:10.317]  But I love these parents that will put their kids on Ritalin and Prozac, but then will call the police on their kid if they find them with some marijuana.
[01:16:10.737 --> 01:16:14.459]  Marijuana is a hundred times better than Prozac.
[01:16:15.020 --> 01:16:17.882]  I mean, Prozac, folks, is heavy-duty hallucinogen.
[01:16:18.842 --> 01:16:22.025]  It brings you into a deeper-than-rim sleep state.
[01:16:22.385 --> 01:16:24.106]  Wide open, you are sleepwalking.
[01:16:24.904 --> 01:16:28.246]  Now that's the medical information on it.
[01:16:29.827 --> 01:16:32.409]  And yeah, it makes you real happy until you have a bad trip.
[01:16:32.429 --> 01:16:34.090]  Then you start cutting yourself.
[01:16:34.190 --> 01:16:37.091]  And you know, they wonder why there's this epidemic of girls cutting themselves.
[01:16:37.131 --> 01:16:39.433]  And they're all on serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
[01:16:40.413 --> 01:16:41.674]  And what do they do when a girl starts doing it?
[01:16:41.694 --> 01:16:43.415]  Because she's on one, they put them on two.
[01:16:43.435 --> 01:16:44.796]  Then they hang themselves.
[01:16:45.196 --> 01:16:49.519]  Every few months some girl hangs herself or blows her head off or cuts her own throat.
[01:16:50.019 --> 01:16:52.561]  And every time she's on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor.
[01:16:52.921 --> 01:16:54.262]  Oh here, let's put her on more.
[01:16:55.245 --> 01:16:57.507]  Their own trials of it show it does that.
[01:16:58.368 --> 01:16:59.409]  Really bad for girls.
[01:16:59.469 --> 01:17:01.811]  It's bad for boys as well, but even worse for girls.
[01:17:03.552 --> 01:17:04.893]  All right, now I've been ranting.
[01:17:05.394 --> 01:17:06.795]  Kenneth, finish up your comment.
[01:17:06.815 --> 01:17:08.917]  I wanted to comment on Ron Paul last hour.
[01:17:09.237 --> 01:17:11.739]  Re-aired from yesterday, talking about impending martial law.
[01:17:12.319 --> 01:17:18.705]  Yeah, I just want to say that I think Ron Paul is probably one of the best Congress you have, say, in the United States.
[01:17:18.765 --> 01:17:20.987]  But I would like to say this about Ron Paul.
[01:17:21.487 --> 01:17:23.469]  He said he preaches the Constitution.
[01:17:23.937 --> 01:17:27.239]  Let me tell you something, the Constitution nor the U.S.
[01:17:28.019 --> 01:17:30.260]  flag can not save us.
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:36.884]  We just have to repent that Jesus Christ our friend and only he can change our lives and thus change our nation.
[01:17:37.184 --> 01:17:44.287]  Well I agree with that, but I mean, I believe the Constitution is inspired by God and it's certainly better than what we've got right now.
[01:17:44.307 --> 01:17:53.572]  Yeah, but it's a secular, remember it's a secular Constitution and Patrick Henry said when they were drawing, them lawyers were drawing up the Constitution, Patrick Henry said, I smell a rat.
[01:17:54.353 --> 01:17:57.095]  Well, that's why they added the Bill of Rights.
[01:17:58.515 --> 01:17:59.616]  Yeah, okay.
[01:18:00.016 --> 01:18:01.277]  Listen, I appreciate your call, Kenneth.
[01:18:01.297 --> 01:18:01.797]  We'll come back.
[01:18:02.157 --> 01:18:04.018]  John in Texas was up next, but he just hung up.
[01:18:04.038 --> 01:18:08.541]  So we'll go to James in New Jersey, James in Texas, Randall in North Carolina, and others.
[01:18:08.561 --> 01:18:11.863]  And I will hurry up the calls, but somebody brings up the drug war.
[01:18:11.883 --> 01:18:14.004]  Somebody brings up trying to reach out to the youth out there.
[01:18:16.025 --> 01:18:21.108]  I mean, you know, you see some young person covered in head to toe and tattoos and piercings and
[01:18:21.713 --> 01:18:27.897]  You know, zits all over their face because they're on so many Grignard reagents from heavy metals and the speed they're snorting.
[01:18:28.638 --> 01:18:31.860]  And you just want to tell them, come on man, the government wants to hurt you.
[01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:38.805]  The government tells you all this is cool, just so you get into being different by defacing yourself.
[01:18:39.893 --> 01:18:44.296]  Instead of uplifting your mind and being the leader you're supposed to be.
[01:18:44.797 --> 01:18:47.719]  And if it makes you mad, hey, you like being conned, go ahead.
[01:18:47.759 --> 01:18:51.101]  Just be conned and do whatever you're going to do to yourself.
[01:18:51.121 --> 01:18:51.722]  Don't listen to me.
[01:18:54.281 --> 01:18:58.162]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:18:58.282 --> 01:19:00.042]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:19:00.102 --> 01:19:01.363]  But not just any water.
[01:19:01.443 --> 01:19:05.664]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water or EO from RPA Biotech.

[01:21:59.311 --> 01:22:01.992]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.

[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:49.363]  All right, I really have been in the preacher mode lately.
[01:22:49.424 --> 01:22:50.464]  There's just so much happening.
[01:23:08.343 --> 01:23:11.624]  And now I'm going to get emails from somebody who's got tattoos saying I'm evil.
[01:23:12.145 --> 01:23:17.567]  The point is, you don't need to have 15 year olds putting tattoos all over their necks and ears and faces.
[01:23:17.627 --> 01:23:29.352]  I mean, if you're in the airborne and it's a rite of passage and some type of rite of passage thing that they've been doing for hundreds of years, whatever.
[01:23:29.972 --> 01:23:33.273]  It's just that it's the stuff happening so early.
[01:23:36.471 --> 01:23:37.352]  It's just amazing.
[01:23:37.572 --> 01:23:39.773]  And the media says it's cool.
[01:23:39.853 --> 01:23:43.276]  And you can bet, folks, that if the media is saying it's cool, it ain't cool.
[01:23:44.417 --> 01:23:45.978]  That's all I'm trying to get across to people.
[01:23:46.038 --> 01:24:00.448]  I mean, you know, when you see some old man, 80 years old, at the beach with World War II tattoos on their arms, that's a little different than, again, people who are 15 years old running out and having a giant devil put on their back.
[01:24:02.469 --> 01:24:03.590]  Total side issues.
[01:24:03.870 --> 01:24:04.771]  Let's just go to the Coles.
[01:24:05.347 --> 01:24:07.868]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in New Jersey.
[01:24:07.888 --> 01:24:08.628]  Go ahead, James.
[01:24:08.768 --> 01:24:10.129]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[01:24:10.289 --> 01:24:10.569]  Good.
[01:24:10.929 --> 01:24:30.195]  Alex, yesterday I visited the local offices of LaRouche PAC, and I spoke to them about you, because I noticed that you and he talk about a lot of the same things, maybe under different labels.
[01:24:31.075 --> 01:24:36.496]  Like what you might call the 13 families, I think he would call the cynicist oligarchy.
[01:24:37.196 --> 01:24:37.976]  That kind of thing.
[01:24:37.996 --> 01:24:42.937]  Well, yeah, I mean, it's the British Dutch Roll family, same people, same policies, yeah.
[01:24:43.277 --> 01:24:43.517]  Yeah.
[01:24:44.337 --> 01:24:55.339]  And so today, in the spirit of cross-pollinization, I call your show to alert your audience to a webcast that Mr. LaRouche is giving right now.
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.980]  Well, let me just be specific for you.
[01:24:59.038 --> 01:25:01.464]  There are a lot of good people in LaRoche's organization.
[01:25:01.504 --> 01:25:03.007]  He puts out a lot of good information.
[01:25:03.048 --> 01:25:05.534]  What he says about the New World Order is very accurate.
[01:25:06.483 --> 01:25:11.007]  But the problem is that his solutions are very centralized.
[01:25:11.568 --> 01:25:16.772]  His solutions are just kind of the leftward side of the New World Order.
[01:25:16.952 --> 01:25:22.277]  So, you know, it's really new lies for old, if you ask me.
[01:25:22.877 --> 01:25:24.739]  And I'm not even saying LaRouche is evil.
[01:25:24.819 --> 01:25:26.541]  I think what he believes is wrong.
[01:25:27.101 --> 01:25:29.143]  I think the solutions he has is wrong.
[01:25:30.037 --> 01:25:32.259]  And again, I'm not in the business of just making friends here.
[01:25:32.279 --> 01:25:36.863]  I know a lot of LaRoucheites like this show, and they get mad when I say that.
[01:25:37.223 --> 01:25:39.345]  You know, I think Webster Tarpley's an incredible mind.
[01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:45.270]  He disagrees with LaRouche on a lot of things, and that's why he left the LaRouche movement.
[01:25:45.911 --> 01:25:50.515]  Because, you know, he calls it some type of messianic type thing, with LaRouche being our savior.
[01:25:51.295 --> 01:25:55.439]  And I just do not agree with the, quote, solutions of LaRouche.
[01:25:56.019 --> 01:25:57.821]  Yeah, and I don't either.
[01:25:58.815 --> 01:26:02.499]  Or, I don't, to the extent that his followers do, anyway.
[01:26:02.999 --> 01:26:13.569]  And that's pretty much what I was saying to them yesterday, that I was in favor of less government, and it seemed to me that Mr. LaRouche's ideas would, of necessity, create more government.
[01:26:14.509 --> 01:26:20.335]  But, nevertheless, you and he do put out a lot of the same information.
[01:26:20.795 --> 01:26:24.979]  But listen, it's like this, it's like you go to an auto mechanic and he diagnoses the problem,
[01:26:25.774 --> 01:26:29.195]  But then, you know, his solution is to charge you five times what it's worth.
[01:26:30.015 --> 01:26:30.615]  What it costs.
[01:26:30.656 --> 01:26:32.076]  I mean, that's kind of the analogy here.
[01:26:32.716 --> 01:26:36.077]  I mean, yes, look, a lot of people will tell you what the problem is.
[01:26:36.817 --> 01:26:42.739]  And we know we have a ruling global elite controlling the central banks, totally scamming everybody, creating hyperinflation.
[01:26:43.299 --> 01:26:47.401]  I mean, LaRouche has been swearing the bubble's going to pop.
[01:26:47.481 --> 01:26:48.921]  I can't talk today.
[01:26:49.241 --> 01:26:53.082]  That the bubble is going to pop for like eight, nine years, and it hasn't happened yet.
[01:26:55.223 --> 01:26:55.383]  Yeah.
[01:26:56.056 --> 01:26:56.897]  Yeah, I know.
[01:26:57.738 --> 01:26:59.339]  More than eight or nine years, actually.
[01:26:59.499 --> 01:27:07.085]  Well, yeah, which makes it only that much more severe when it does pop, but regardless, anything else, James?
[01:27:07.866 --> 01:27:14.151]  Well, the other thing that's on my mind, I'm seeing somebody that's completely apolitical.
[01:27:15.692 --> 01:27:23.779]  And I was wondering if you could recommend, like, popular movies with kind of like a subtext that might educate them.
[01:27:25.851 --> 01:27:27.752]  For instance, they would never watch one of your videos.
[01:27:27.792 --> 01:27:28.432]  They just would not.
[01:27:29.213 --> 01:27:37.337]  But they might watch a movie... You know, somebody that's that tuned out... I mean, almost everybody knows something's wrong right now.
[01:27:37.738 --> 01:27:40.899]  I mean, it's really popular and trendy to know about the new world order right now.
[01:27:41.259 --> 01:27:51.965]  I mean, I'm not trying to knock your girlfriend, but if you can't... I mean, if they're not even tuned in to the fact that something's wrong, then I've just... Oh, they know something's wrong.
[01:27:51.985 --> 01:27:53.066]  They just don't want to watch it.
[01:27:53.888 --> 01:27:54.888]  They don't want to hear about it.
[01:27:54.908 --> 01:27:58.429]  Well, that's even more common, to know something's wrong and then not care.
[01:27:58.789 --> 01:27:59.070]  Yeah.
[01:27:59.370 --> 01:28:02.290]  Well, not even that they don't care, they just don't want to hear about it.
[01:28:03.311 --> 01:28:04.811]  Well, they might watch a movie.
[01:28:05.191 --> 01:28:06.052]  You understand what I'm saying?
[01:28:06.352 --> 01:28:07.072]  And plant a seed.
[01:28:07.112 --> 01:28:08.152]  Yeah, I really can't help them.
[01:28:09.273 --> 01:28:11.353]  I mean, if somebody doesn't, that's even worse.
[01:28:11.413 --> 01:28:14.454]  They know something's wrong, but just don't, or just don't want to do anything about it.
[01:28:15.314 --> 01:28:17.515]  You know, I'll think about it during the break, try to give you some examples.
[01:28:17.555 --> 01:28:18.075]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:18.095 --> 01:28:18.915]  Alright, I appreciate it.
[01:28:19.075 --> 01:28:20.656]  Sure, I mean, you could show her Gattaca.
[01:28:21.485 --> 01:28:25.166]  You could get her the old, uh, well, the color 1984 from 1984.
[01:28:25.966 --> 01:28:28.927]  You could, um... THX 1138.
[01:28:29.467 --> 01:28:33.088]  Uh, the island that just came out's pretty good.
[01:28:34.348 --> 01:28:36.849]  I mean, there's... That message is everywhere.
[01:28:36.869 --> 01:28:40.890]  I mean, I don't know where... Ah, it's pointless.
[01:28:41.210 --> 01:28:42.670]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:45.171]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.651 --> 01:28:47.271]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.171 --> 01:28:50.872]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:59.365]  Did you know there is an easy and inexpensive way for you to look and feel better in less than 30 days?
[01:28:59.525 --> 01:29:05.570]  You can lose excess weight, have more energy, sleep better, and be mentally on top of your games without even trying.
[01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:09.293]  This is not about vitamins or the latest nutritional wonder products.
[01:29:09.333 --> 01:29:10.494]  We've all had enough of those.
[01:29:10.774 --> 01:29:13.515]  I'm talking about God's pure, whole food.
[01:29:13.555 --> 01:29:16.335]  When you consume them, you look and feel better automatically.
[01:29:16.455 --> 01:29:22.577]  And thanks to URI International, you don't have to endure tasteless food or the expense and hassle of juicing.
[01:29:22.717 --> 01:29:32.799]  Using biblical farming standards and 21st century technology, URI grows, harvests, and prepares God's whole foods in pure powder form to protect and lock in their nutrients.
[01:29:32.899 --> 01:29:37.500]  URI ships this powder from the farm right to your doorstep, so you can conveniently consume
[01:29:37.580 --> 01:29:40.143]  Consume it either in delicious drinks or veggie caps.
[01:29:40.323 --> 01:29:42.766]  Don't wait any longer to look and feel your best.
[01:29:42.786 --> 01:29:47.492]  Click the bright orange and white URI banner at GCNlive.com or call toll free 888-224-7416.
[01:29:47.512 --> 01:29:47.852]  That's 888-224-7416.
[01:29:53.639 --> 01:29:56.660]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:30:01.882]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:02.142 --> 01:30:06.503]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.803 --> 01:30:15.706]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury and iron and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.906 --> 01:30:19.527]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.827 --> 01:30:24.856]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:25.156 --> 01:30:31.848]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.361 --> 01:30:33.021]  What about you?
[01:30:33.662 --> 01:30:39.025]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:40.245 --> 01:30:42.126]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:55.865 --> 01:30:57.325]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[01:30:57.525 --> 01:31:01.466]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[01:31:01.746 --> 01:31:09.048]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste-fill, is something we all face every day.
[01:31:09.348 --> 01:31:11.248]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[01:31:11.568 --> 01:31:18.329]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:21.510]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:27.253]  Your Nuke Alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.
[01:31:27.533 --> 01:31:28.894]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:34.456]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nuke Alert today.
[01:31:34.736 --> 01:31:37.938]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[01:31:38.298 --> 01:31:42.820]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[01:31:43.101 --> 01:31:43.301]  Call 877-817-9829.
[01:31:46.702 --> 01:31:50.083]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nuke Alert today.
[01:31:50.203 --> 01:31:50.683]  Nuke Alert.
[01:31:50.944 --> 01:31:52.024]  Isn't your family worth it?
[01:31:55.125 --> 01:32:00.286]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.967 --> 01:32:03.367]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:03.387 --> 01:32:14.911]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us on this live Wednesday edition of the halfway point, the waypoint in this broadcast.
[01:32:16.658 --> 01:32:19.420]  Point of no return.
[01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:20.081]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:21.902 --> 01:32:23.964]  Did you hear the interview yesterday we had with Ron Paul?
[01:32:25.185 --> 01:32:26.626]  We aired part of it in the last hour.
[01:32:27.567 --> 01:32:33.072]  Where he openly talked about the government wanting martial law to confiscate our guns and dominate and control us.
[01:32:34.974 --> 01:32:41.279]  I mean, that's a Vietnam veteran, medical doctor, most conservative voting record in recent House history.
[01:32:43.183 --> 01:32:46.544]  Being targeted by Tom DeLay for removal in his district.
[01:32:47.444 --> 01:32:55.427]  Rewritten to actually, redrawn to actually help the Democrats see, and the Republicans have done this over and over again.
[01:32:57.027 --> 01:33:06.831]  DeLay actually wrote, rewrote the map in Texas, this has even been in a local paper, to target conservative Democrats and conservative Republicans.
[01:33:07.771 --> 01:33:09.371]  They're savage.
[01:33:09.652 --> 01:33:11.012]  Again, another example.
[01:33:11.804 --> 01:33:13.085]  Of what we're talking about here.
[01:33:14.505 --> 01:33:18.667]  And here's Ron Paul talking about the open move for martial law.
[01:33:18.707 --> 01:33:20.468]  The end of America!
[01:33:20.488 --> 01:33:21.208]  Do you understand?
[01:33:21.248 --> 01:33:23.689]  But the borders will stay wide open.
[01:33:23.709 --> 01:33:26.290]  The foreign troops will pour in.
[01:33:26.851 --> 01:33:28.451]  The foreigners will pour in.
[01:33:28.751 --> 01:33:31.913]  Our military now becoming more and more composed of foreign troops.
[01:33:33.718 --> 01:33:35.278]  It's happening right now.
[01:33:35.358 --> 01:33:42.820]  The unbelievable, the unthinkable, the stuff that we were talking about 10 years ago on air and being laughed at for, is now mainstream news.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:50.022]  And our last caller, James in New Jersey, I mean, it's an important call he made.
[01:33:50.042 --> 01:33:54.903]  I mean, maybe his girlfriend deep down is afraid of all of this so she doesn't want to hear about it.
[01:33:55.943 --> 01:34:00.684]  Or, even worse, it could be that, and we see this a lot, people are very selfish.
[01:34:02.088 --> 01:34:07.433]  They hear about the New World Order, lots of middle class yuppies are like this, and I don't care, I only care about myself.
[01:34:07.694 --> 01:34:10.136]  You worry about that while I'm out making money.
[01:34:11.457 --> 01:34:12.458]  Let me give you a newsflash.
[01:34:13.219 --> 01:34:16.022]  People who really care about themselves, care about others.
[01:34:16.802 --> 01:34:22.568]  People who really care about their communities, they do it from an instinctive level of caring about themselves.
[01:34:24.477 --> 01:34:40.965]  When you have a society where everybody only cares about themselves, where nobody's willing to stick up for anybody else but themselves, when everybody's self-centered, when everybody's afraid of getting out of line, you ensure a climate where you're going to get dehumanization and enslavement.
[01:34:42.506 --> 01:34:43.626]  And that's happening right now.
[01:34:43.686 --> 01:34:45.427]  That's happening today.
[01:34:46.708 --> 01:34:47.608]  In the real world.
[01:34:51.608 --> 01:34:54.252]  And so you're in danger because of your attitude.
[01:34:54.272 --> 01:34:57.135]  I mean, I would tell her, you're in danger because of your attitude.
[01:34:59.178 --> 01:35:04.625]  A lot of people also have subscribed to this modern advertising idea of perception is reality.
[01:35:06.407 --> 01:35:09.331]  Only so far as the illusion or the delusion goes.
[01:35:11.121 --> 01:35:21.817]  I mean, you can be on LSD or be on PCP or peyote, and you can think that that window is actually a stairway to heaven, but you walk out of that 20-story window, you're gonna die at the bottom!
[01:35:23.937 --> 01:35:26.279]  So your perception is not really reality.
[01:35:26.579 --> 01:35:40.429]  You know, the White House Deputy Chief of Staff that really runs things, Karl Rove can dance around all day saying that we're invincible and we're unstoppable and that he can invade, you know, three other countries and la la la and he makes reality.
[01:35:40.889 --> 01:35:44.712]  But he will actually run into reality and it will crush him.
[01:35:47.354 --> 01:35:50.676]  But not before it crushes a bunch of our troops and our economy.
[01:35:52.751 --> 01:35:57.493]  You know, you can lie to yourself all day and say Saddam carried out 9-11 when it's admittedly a fraud.
[01:35:57.893 --> 01:36:00.134]  But reality will come crashing down on you.
[01:36:00.434 --> 01:36:04.755]  That our government created Saddam, put him in power, told him to attack Iran.
[01:36:04.775 --> 01:36:08.476]  Do you understand how wrong that is?
[01:36:08.556 --> 01:36:09.537]  How corrupt that is?
[01:36:09.577 --> 01:36:10.717]  How hypocritical that is?
[01:36:10.777 --> 01:36:11.798]  How evil that is?
[01:36:12.538 --> 01:36:14.258]  How just pathetic that is?
[01:36:14.318 --> 01:36:15.339]  How dirty that is?
[01:36:15.359 --> 01:36:18.320]  Alright, let's hurry through your calls.
[01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:20.200]  Let's talk to James in Texas.
[01:36:20.741 --> 01:36:21.501]  James, go ahead.
[01:36:22.438 --> 01:36:23.938]  Hello, Alex.
[01:36:24.939 --> 01:36:25.639]  Hi.
[01:36:25.819 --> 01:36:30.300]  Thanks for being so outspoken and hanging in there on these issues.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:40.723]  I heard you talking about your love for the natural things this morning, the rivers and... Are you on a speakerphone?
[01:36:40.783 --> 01:36:41.683]  Are you on a speakerphone?
[01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:42.563]  Yes, sir.
[01:36:42.883 --> 01:36:43.843]  Yeah, yeah, listen.
[01:36:43.863 --> 01:36:45.264]  101 on radio.
[01:36:45.564 --> 01:36:47.204]  No cordless phones, no speakerphones.
[01:36:47.304 --> 01:36:49.045]  It's almost unintelligible.
[01:36:49.105 --> 01:36:49.685]  It's pure torture.
[01:36:49.705 --> 01:36:50.525]  Can you hear me better?
[01:36:51.647 --> 01:36:52.788]  Are you still on the speakerphone?
[01:36:52.808 --> 01:36:53.128]  No.
[01:36:53.588 --> 01:36:54.428]  Okay, now I can hear you better.
[01:36:54.468 --> 01:36:54.789]  Go ahead.
[01:36:55.069 --> 01:37:03.673]  Okay, I heard you talking about your love for the natural things this morning.
[01:37:03.713 --> 01:37:07.475]  The rivers, the streams, and the critters and all.
[01:37:08.735 --> 01:37:15.778]  And I was wondering if you had ever read Isaiah 24.
[01:37:19.788 --> 01:37:21.729]  I'm sure I have, but I don't remember the verse.
[01:37:22.149 --> 01:37:30.331]  Okay, in Isaiah 24, let me paraphrase, it says something like, the earth is polluted.
[01:37:30.351 --> 01:37:42.815]  They've joined house to house, field to field, and therefore man and his work will be burned, and a few will be left.
[01:37:44.155 --> 01:37:49.237]  And then in 2 Peter chapter 3, it also says the elements will melt with fervent heat.
[01:37:50.242 --> 01:38:06.890]  And so in my opinion, that tells me at least that what we're doing wrong today, you know, if we could all just quit buying the gasoline or reduce our consumption of it, we would cut the rug out from under
[01:38:08.341 --> 01:38:11.943]  These big polluters and the people that control our lives.
[01:38:12.343 --> 01:38:15.744]  And what they're masters of is co-opting.
[01:38:16.044 --> 01:38:20.386]  You get real environmental movements going, they just co-opt it, use it to steal property.
[01:38:20.406 --> 01:38:26.088]  It has nothing to do with stopping the genetic engineering, which is the real threat, or the dumping of toxic waste.
[01:38:26.349 --> 01:38:30.530]  They co-opt every good movement, and that's really a problem we face.
[01:38:30.570 --> 01:38:31.611]  Thanks a lot for the call.
[01:38:31.671 --> 01:38:32.991]  I appreciate you holding, James.
[01:38:33.532 --> 01:38:36.313]  Let's talk to Randy in North Carolina.
[01:38:36.333 --> 01:38:36.933]  Go ahead, Randy.
[01:38:38.021 --> 01:38:39.822]  Uh, yes, how are you doing this afternoon?
[01:38:40.002 --> 01:38:40.342]  Gotcha!
[01:38:40.962 --> 01:38:41.702]  I know you are.
[01:38:41.722 --> 01:38:44.423]  I enjoy listening to your program sometimes.
[01:38:44.503 --> 01:38:45.664]  I can't listen every day.
[01:38:46.644 --> 01:38:51.025]  Uh, I have one thing to say to the people who are listening to this program right now.
[01:38:51.045 --> 01:38:56.527]  Buy yourself a real good water filtration system.
[01:38:56.747 --> 01:38:58.688]  And don't say I can't afford it.
[01:38:59.008 --> 01:39:01.109]  You cannot afford not to.
[01:39:01.129 --> 01:39:03.630]  I bought one five years ago.
[01:39:03.710 --> 01:39:05.850]  I figured I'd save thousands of dollars.
[01:39:06.531 --> 01:39:07.511]  Buy a bottle of water.
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:09.841]  How much does it cost you?
[01:39:12.062 --> 01:39:14.243]  I think it's like a dollar, dollar fifteen.
[01:39:14.283 --> 01:39:15.884]  Fifty cents a day!
[01:39:16.804 --> 01:39:20.926]  If that's all it costs you, it adds up to a whole bunch of money.
[01:39:21.667 --> 01:39:27.089]  So anybody out there who says I can't afford it, no, you cannot afford not to do it.
[01:39:27.790 --> 01:39:34.453]  And what do you do with, you go to the store and there is no bottled water, or you have to stand in a real long line, and um,
[01:39:35.396 --> 01:39:36.317]  Stop and think about it.
[01:39:36.397 --> 01:39:37.738]  Well, that's the Army's job.
[01:39:37.798 --> 01:39:44.202]  It's their job to aim machine guns at me and break my family up, but I can go to the sports stadium and get water.
[01:39:45.122 --> 01:39:55.729]  Well, I suppose if you don't have your own water filtration system inside your own home, then you're in sad shape.
[01:39:57.610 --> 01:39:58.711]  That's the way I look at it.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.821]  Well, I heartily agree with you, my friend.
[01:40:02.441 --> 01:40:05.583]  And is that your point you'd like to make today?
[01:40:06.343 --> 01:40:06.824]  Uh, no.
[01:40:07.984 --> 01:40:17.369]  The other point I would like to make is, um... These people who are in government these days are not trustworthy.
[01:40:17.810 --> 01:40:18.230]  Period.
[01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:21.551]  You cannot trust any of them.
[01:40:22.132 --> 01:40:26.114]  That doesn't mean there isn't one somewhere or another that you can trust.
[01:40:26.584 --> 01:40:34.007]  But that person is in government, and that person is not trustworthy, because if they were trustworthy, they would not be in the government.
[01:40:36.188 --> 01:40:46.652]  I've got very seriously, even Ron Paul, I like Ron Paul from what I've heard over the years, although I've not heard him say anything lately, which makes me very suspicious.
[01:40:47.293 --> 01:40:50.195]  Well, no, he says stuff all the time on his website and reports.
[01:40:50.516 --> 01:40:52.097]  The National News doesn't put him on.
[01:40:52.437 --> 01:40:54.979]  Well, I don't have access to the web.
[01:40:55.039 --> 01:40:56.420]  But, I mean, you heard him here.
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:40:58.562]  I mean, his voting record's perfect.
[01:40:58.902 --> 01:40:59.663]  Well, that's good.
[01:40:59.683 --> 01:41:07.509]  That's good, but I'm still saying, though... Look, you won't see Ron Paul in office very soon if they get in all these electronic voting machines that have been proven to be total frauds.
[01:41:07.929 --> 01:41:08.149]  Right.
[01:41:08.349 --> 01:41:10.911]  Well, this is like... See, I live in North Carolina.
[01:41:11.332 --> 01:41:13.153]  We have lots of Mexicans here.
[01:41:13.773 --> 01:41:16.115]  I don't trust any of these Mexicans, period.
[01:41:16.556 --> 01:41:16.776]  But...
[01:41:17.236 --> 01:41:18.497]  That doesn't mean that I hate them.
[01:41:18.557 --> 01:41:19.357]  I don't hate them.
[01:41:19.457 --> 01:41:20.478]  I just don't trust them.
[01:41:21.358 --> 01:41:22.679]  And why don't you trust them?
[01:41:23.059 --> 01:41:24.140]  You mean the illegal aliens?
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:36.186]  I have had opportunities to speak to them and I have never one time had a good feeling about speaking to any of them.
[01:41:37.126 --> 01:41:38.687]  Well, listen, I appreciate your call, sir.
[01:41:38.847 --> 01:41:45.050]  I think to say that all Mexicans or all of anybody is bad is really selling yourself short.
[01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:46.831]  I have a lot of great friends that are Hispanic.
[01:41:47.806 --> 01:41:55.668]  We have to know that all illegal aliens in this country are felons, and statistically they are engaged in more crime than any other group.
[01:41:55.728 --> 01:42:07.812]  Now, that's because, in a lot of cases, the roughest and the toughest, or the outcast, or people fleeing Mexican justice, are coming here.
[01:42:08.432 --> 01:42:09.372]  It's just common sense.
[01:42:11.893 --> 01:42:15.634]  I mean, they just had a report out, speaking of the devil, out of North Carolina.
[01:42:15.674 --> 01:42:16.794]  We covered it yesterday.
[01:42:18.272 --> 01:42:28.618]  Where 25% of the automobile accidents, the fatal accidents in your state, was it North Carolina or South Carolina, I think it was North, I gotta dig the article out, were illegal aliens.
[01:42:29.919 --> 01:42:33.160]  When illegal aliens are only about 6% of your state's population.
[01:42:34.321 --> 01:42:34.982]  Why is that?
[01:42:35.062 --> 01:42:42.926]  Because they don't have insurance, they don't get stopped when they're drunk driving, they don't get their license pulled because they're basically below the radar.
[01:42:45.177 --> 01:42:50.481]  And it's true that about 30% of the California prisons are illegal aliens alone.
[01:42:52.282 --> 01:42:58.666]  And it is true that the illegals come across to have a baby here, and then that costs on average, what, $20,000?
[01:42:59.206 --> 01:43:03.589]  And you and I get to pay for it, whether we're black or white or Hispanic, it doesn't matter.
[01:43:05.760 --> 01:43:18.726]  But I've found actually with even the illegal aliens, if you're really able to talk to them in Spanish about the New World Order, and they're not just agreeing with you, I mean they really understand it and understand they're being manipulated, they're just, most of them are here desperately wanting work.
[01:43:19.286 --> 01:43:23.628]  But still, it's like if we've got a lifeboat that can take 20 people, we can't put 100 in it.
[01:43:24.348 --> 01:43:28.150]  And I mean, you know, there's 6.5 billion people, about to be 7 billion,
[01:43:30.123 --> 01:43:32.204]  The last census is 6.5 billion.
[01:43:32.464 --> 01:43:33.304]  They do it every 10 years.
[01:43:33.384 --> 01:43:35.205]  Right now, we're probably at about 7 billion.
[01:43:35.245 --> 01:43:35.805]  We don't know.
[01:43:36.686 --> 01:43:38.927]  But it's over 6.5 billion.
[01:43:39.207 --> 01:43:40.727]  They all want to come here, folks.
[01:43:41.087 --> 01:43:44.989]  I mean, look at how populated the country is with 299 million or whatever.
[01:43:45.729 --> 01:43:47.510]  Look, we just cannot take any more.
[01:43:48.650 --> 01:43:51.051]  And it's that simple.
[01:43:51.131 --> 01:43:52.972]  What he said about water filters is absolutely true.
[01:43:53.012 --> 01:43:57.274]  And yes, we have a sponsor that's American-made, high-quality, gravity-fed filters.
[01:43:59.583 --> 01:44:05.188]  And yeah, you'll pay a lot more for a piece of junk somewhere else, but you know, it's better to filter some than none.
[01:44:05.988 --> 01:44:06.909]  And you'll save money.
[01:44:07.349 --> 01:44:08.951]  So I don't know why people don't take advantage of it.
[01:44:09.331 --> 01:44:11.773]  Let's talk to Jeff in Ohio.
[01:44:11.813 --> 01:44:12.433]  Jeff, go ahead.
[01:44:13.074 --> 01:44:14.054]  Afternoon, Alex.
[01:44:14.255 --> 01:44:14.555]  Hi.
[01:44:15.556 --> 01:44:22.221]  I don't want to make this the crux of my call, but that last call was just... I've worked with people that are Hispanic,
[01:44:22.881 --> 01:44:27.782]  That have come here to make money so that they can buy things for themselves back in their countries.
[01:44:27.802 --> 01:44:29.383]  Most of them don't want to stay here.
[01:44:29.443 --> 01:44:31.003]  They want to make money and go back home.
[01:44:32.123 --> 01:44:34.904]  And they're some of the most genuine people you could ever meet.
[01:44:37.144 --> 01:44:38.885]  I have to agree with you.
[01:44:38.985 --> 01:44:40.285]  I take offense to that call.
[01:44:40.745 --> 01:44:48.507]  But beyond that, I've heard you and Jack Blood talk about Lyndon LaRouche, about All I Can Stand, and I had to make this call today.
[01:44:49.287 --> 01:44:52.008]  This is not hyperbole or not
[01:44:53.106 --> 01:45:04.210]  Second guessing, I was personally involved in a situation with my aunt where he and his organization victimized her for almost a half a million dollars.
[01:45:04.791 --> 01:45:18.196]  I had to literally move into her house and they were watching the house and if I would leave for one minute they would show up and deliver flowers to her and ask her for donations and we had to literally come in between
[01:45:18.894 --> 01:45:25.877]  His organization and him, and my aunt's estate, to stop him from draining her dry.
[01:45:26.197 --> 01:45:31.079]  And I think people need to start asking themselves, where does this man get his money?
[01:45:31.519 --> 01:45:34.080]  Where does he get the money that he uses to do what he's doing?
[01:45:34.100 --> 01:45:46.845]  You know, I have a personal friend, he's talking about it publicly so I can tell the story, I have a personal friend, Kevin, whose father was a big aerospace scientist, and when he died, they didn't know it, every dime went to LaRouche.
[01:45:47.563 --> 01:45:52.432]  So it's funny you mention that, and sir, I really can't let you go any further without documentation.
[01:45:52.773 --> 01:45:57.221]  If you'd like to send me documentation, I'd be more than glad to... I absolutely can do that.
[01:45:59.217 --> 01:46:09.828]  I don't want people to blindly follow this guy down the street without having some reservations about who he is.
[01:46:10.068 --> 01:46:16.955]  Well now you understand, I've said that he talks about a lot of good information and a lot of the problems he discusses are accurate.
[01:46:17.315 --> 01:46:19.177]  I've just said his solutions I don't agree with.
[01:46:19.517 --> 01:46:22.258]  I mean, you said you're sick of hearing us talk about it.
[01:46:22.458 --> 01:46:29.600]  I just didn't know about what you're claiming and I have no way to verify it at this point.
[01:46:30.460 --> 01:46:31.081]  No, I understand.
[01:46:31.101 --> 01:46:33.361]  I don't want people to think I'm out promoting LaRouche.
[01:46:33.441 --> 01:46:33.842]  I'm not.
[01:46:34.502 --> 01:46:38.983]  I hear you and Jack Blood talk about him a lot and it's starting to get my dandruff.
[01:46:39.063 --> 01:46:40.064]  Callers call in.
[01:46:41.744 --> 01:46:42.525]  Oh, I agree.
[01:46:42.845 --> 01:46:44.566]  No, I have no problem with you whatsoever.
[01:46:44.586 --> 01:46:45.727]  Not even the caller calls in.
[01:46:45.747 --> 01:46:47.668]  I don't ever talk about LaRouche unless I get a phone call.
[01:46:47.708 --> 01:46:49.309]  Right, right.
[01:46:49.609 --> 01:46:53.191]  Another thing I wanted to say is when you go into preacher mode, you're at your finest.
[01:46:54.112 --> 01:47:01.777]  And I'd like to see you do like a movie where it's just you on about six cups of coffee and just
[01:47:02.964 --> 01:47:03.505]  Letting go.
[01:47:04.665 --> 01:47:08.849]  Because I think... By movie mode, you mean what I did in Waking Live?
[01:47:08.949 --> 01:47:09.669]  Absolutely.
[01:47:09.929 --> 01:47:12.471]  You are the finest human being on this planet.
[01:47:12.531 --> 01:47:13.352]  Oh, stop it!
[01:47:13.692 --> 01:47:14.293]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:14.433 --> 01:47:15.193]  I appreciate it.
[01:47:15.554 --> 01:47:17.555]  Well, seriously, folks, I'm not.
[01:47:18.236 --> 01:47:22.239]  I don't have a very tall view of myself, but at least I'm taking action and that's enough.
[01:47:22.259 --> 01:47:22.959]  That's what it's all about.
[01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.861]  Stepping up to the plate, showing up.
[01:47:26.542 --> 01:47:29.084]  That's the biggest part of life, folks, is showing up.
[01:47:30.362 --> 01:47:37.704]  There's a million people I know who want to be successful and they've got all these big hopes and dreams and these grand plans, but you've got to start laying the foundation first.
[01:47:38.544 --> 01:47:41.025]  So much of life is just doing it like a woodpecker.
[01:47:41.085 --> 01:47:45.406]  I mean, if you just sit there hitting the same spot over and over again, something's going to give.
[01:47:46.606 --> 01:47:52.248]  Now, LaRouche aside, Lennon and LaRouche aside, I will say this.
[01:47:53.508 --> 01:47:55.869]  Man, I've called up before trying to get him on.
[01:47:57.111 --> 01:48:02.753]  And then they automatically know you've got to interview three of these people first and promote this thing before we'll let him come on.
[01:48:02.793 --> 01:48:06.975]  I'm just like... At least the times I called, I was like, C'est la vie!
[01:48:07.795 --> 01:48:08.255]  I'm done!
[01:48:08.275 --> 01:48:09.736]  Because nobody does that.
[01:48:09.776 --> 01:48:11.697]  I mean, I can get a senator on in a day's notice.
[01:48:12.517 --> 01:48:15.298]  And I'm not tooting my horn, it's just that we can get him on.
[01:48:15.318 --> 01:48:22.241]  So it was almost like it was some kind of... I was being basically put in a squeeze shoot.
[01:48:22.887 --> 01:48:26.551]  But then I meet the LaRouche members, just salt of the earth, really nice people.
[01:48:27.031 --> 01:48:40.645]  When I flew to England, one of the flight attendants, male flight attendant, you know, middle aged guy, real nice, really informed about politics, knew about my website, had learned about it from the LaRouche people.
[01:48:41.505 --> 01:48:44.286]  And, uh, you know, I was telling him that I like Tarpley better than LaRouche.
[01:48:44.306 --> 01:48:47.266]  I think Tarpley's much smarter than LaRouche and has better ideas.
[01:48:47.306 --> 01:48:51.107]  And it was like I was talking bad about Jesus Christ or something, you know.
[01:48:51.207 --> 01:48:54.628]  Oh, how dare you say that John the Baptist is better than Christ?
[01:48:54.668 --> 01:48:57.909]  You know, it was very religious, almost.
[01:48:58.109 --> 01:48:58.989]  And I'll just say this.
[01:48:59.549 --> 01:49:02.250]  I don't want to be your leader, folks, and I don't want your inheritance.
[01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:09.932]  I heard another patriot a few months ago on the radio going, send me your, send me, you know, your money when you die.
[01:49:09.952 --> 01:49:11.032]  I almost threw up.
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:14.381]  I mean, I really did almost throw up.
[01:49:15.581 --> 01:49:19.883]  And listen, I've got family, I'm not going to get into it, drained by the Republican Party.
[01:49:20.863 --> 01:49:22.344]  You want to talk about money?
[01:49:22.404 --> 01:49:22.744]  What was it?
[01:49:22.764 --> 01:49:34.769]  It was almost a million smackers that this family member, and she's gone now, God bless her, in the nursing home being sucked dry of everything she had.
[01:49:36.150 --> 01:49:41.492]  Right up close to a million dollars into those greedy bastards' clutches.
[01:49:43.078 --> 01:49:44.679]  Give me a break.
[01:49:44.699 --> 01:49:46.280]  You know, that's the thing about charity, folks.
[01:49:46.620 --> 01:49:51.123]  Just giving is bad if you don't know exactly what it's going to.
[01:49:54.833 --> 01:50:02.198]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:50:02.478 --> 01:50:07.221]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:50:07.441 --> 01:50:13.085]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:50:13.325 --> 01:50:17.851]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:50:18.072 --> 01:50:25.221]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:50:25.241 --> 01:50:28.626]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network,
[01:50:28.646 --> 01:50:28.846]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:50:54.517 --> 01:50:57.501]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.861 --> 01:51:06.691]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:07.011 --> 01:51:11.697]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:12.137 --> 01:51:18.864]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.264 --> 01:51:31.015]  It also removes foul tastes and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.515 --> 01:51:35.977]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:52:56.895 --> 01:52:58.556]  Folks, I'll tell you my philosophy.
[01:52:58.796 --> 01:53:01.216]  I am only scared of God.
[01:53:03.617 --> 01:53:09.979]  And I know that if I willfully do bad things, and we all struggle with, you know, at least we should.
[01:53:09.999 --> 01:53:13.340]  If you're totally given over to evil, you just do evil things automatically.
[01:53:13.640 --> 01:53:15.421]  But I struggle with doing bad all the time.
[01:53:15.461 --> 01:53:20.082]  I mean, I'm a man, first and foremost, and you know what men like.
[01:53:21.262 --> 01:53:26.544]  And, you know, I like fast cars, ice cold beer, and fast women.
[01:53:27.273 --> 01:53:29.594]  And you know, that's stuff I'd stay completely away from.
[01:53:29.614 --> 01:53:34.135]  Because, you know, I love my wife and I love my family and I love God.
[01:53:34.915 --> 01:53:40.597]  And I know the blessings you get from doing the right thing.
[01:53:40.857 --> 01:53:47.599]  And I could never, never rip somebody off knowingly.
[01:53:48.861 --> 01:53:50.522]  Number one, I have empathy.
[01:53:50.902 --> 01:53:52.262]  I wouldn't like that to be done to me.
[01:53:52.683 --> 01:53:56.324]  At an instinctive level, when I do something bad to somebody, I feel it myself.
[01:53:56.424 --> 01:53:58.825]  We have to try to develop our conscience.
[01:53:58.885 --> 01:54:02.606]  You know, it sure is a weakness in today's workforce and in corporations.
[01:54:02.666 --> 01:54:05.007]  No, we have to develop our empathy.
[01:54:05.948 --> 01:54:07.228]  It actually makes us stronger.
[01:54:07.968 --> 01:54:09.749]  And I'm not trying to get off into a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.
[01:54:09.769 --> 01:54:11.350]  This is the experiences I've had.
[01:54:11.970 --> 01:54:15.011]  But I've been sent donations before, and we don't solicit them.
[01:54:16.428 --> 01:54:24.154]  Though I've in the past thought about changing that, because I hear known charlatans all over constantly begging, and then even implying they're affiliated with me.
[01:54:24.635 --> 01:54:28.698]  And then I'm going, they're going to do it on my name, I might as well, because I know it'll go to computers.
[01:54:29.078 --> 01:54:30.599]  I know it'll go to video cameras.
[01:54:30.980 --> 01:54:33.942]  I know it'll go to doing things we can't afford to do.
[01:54:35.383 --> 01:54:35.864]  But you know what?
[01:54:35.964 --> 01:54:37.505]  I don't even care about that stuff.
[01:54:38.186 --> 01:54:45.310]  And so I've been sending donations a few times, and we'll actually call up or send a letter and say, hey, if you don't have a lot of money, we don't want this.
[01:54:45.711 --> 01:54:49.593]  In fact, I have, and I've told other patriots this, and they've actually had convulsions.
[01:54:49.613 --> 01:54:52.175]  You know, I've sent $10,000 checks back.
[01:54:52.935 --> 01:54:56.857]  And I'll call up a little old lady and go, ma'am, are you, how are you doing?
[01:54:56.877 --> 01:54:58.438]  Do you have Alzheimer's?
[01:54:58.999 --> 01:55:00.520]  Well, yes, the doctor says I'm starting to get it.
[01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:01.500]  Oh, Alex, I love you.
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:02.421]  Oh, God, I love you.
[01:55:02.901 --> 01:55:04.102]  Well, how much money do you have?
[01:55:04.142 --> 01:55:06.923]  Well, I've got, well, you shouldn't tell me how much money you have, but you just didn't listen.
[01:55:08.373 --> 01:55:10.795]  I'm going to mail you this check back with void written on it.
[01:55:11.195 --> 01:55:13.077]  And that $10,000 meant nothing to me.
[01:55:14.137 --> 01:55:16.539]  It's just absolute birdcage liner, folks.
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:20.242]  If the lady was worth $100 million and wanted to do that, fine.
[01:55:20.762 --> 01:55:22.744]  But I am not going to sit there and do that.
[01:55:23.304 --> 01:55:24.065]  And I never will.
[01:55:24.125 --> 01:55:26.287]  And I'm not even proud of this.
[01:55:27.027 --> 01:55:27.327]  Okay?
[01:55:27.367 --> 01:55:28.688]  It's not like, ooh, aren't I good?
[01:55:28.708 --> 01:55:30.970]  I don't even have to think about it.
[01:55:31.070 --> 01:55:37.135]  Once you do this over and over again, once you make yourself do the right thing over and over again, it becomes rote.
[01:55:37.990 --> 01:55:39.791]  You don't even have to make yourself anymore.
[01:55:40.892 --> 01:55:41.873]  At least with a lot of issues.
[01:55:41.913 --> 01:55:44.315]  Some, I still have to literally restrain myself.
[01:55:44.335 --> 01:55:50.960]  Some of the more fleshly type things that... But, you know, this is the reality.
[01:55:52.361 --> 01:55:55.823]  And so, I know these money-grubbing people out there, and they're not happy, folks.
[01:55:55.923 --> 01:55:56.904]  They're not happy.
[01:55:57.665 --> 01:55:59.106]  And so, I don't want to be them.
[01:55:59.186 --> 01:56:00.907]  I mean, they're literally cursed, folks.
[01:56:01.468 --> 01:56:05.991]  Listen, you think I'd be alive ten minutes if God lifted his head up from around me?
[01:56:06.031 --> 01:56:07.152]  And believe me, it's real, folks.
[01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:20.514]  No, my life wouldn't be worth 10 cents or 10 minutes if I didn't really try to give myself completely over to God.
[01:56:21.075 --> 01:56:22.495]  Which I do, that's my prayer.
[01:56:22.855 --> 01:56:23.896]  I just want to be used.
[01:56:24.296 --> 01:56:25.336]  I give myself up.
[01:56:26.056 --> 01:56:29.438]  It's not slavery because I do it willingly, but I would willingly be God's slave.
[01:56:29.478 --> 01:56:30.298]  I want to be a slave.
[01:56:30.954 --> 01:56:32.795]  I want to just totally be taken over.
[01:56:33.656 --> 01:56:35.998]  I want to be totally infused with God.
[01:56:36.318 --> 01:56:41.702]  Every time I sin, I just can't stand it, because that's one inch of me that doesn't have God in it.
[01:56:42.783 --> 01:56:44.104]  I want to be one with God.
[01:56:45.004 --> 01:56:48.907]  I want to be close to God, to the point of where you get incredible discernment.
[01:56:49.368 --> 01:56:54.631]  And then you just see the churches as like these satanic temples once you get discernment.
[01:56:54.772 --> 01:56:55.712]  It's scary, folks.
[01:56:56.253 --> 01:56:57.894]  I don't get a lot into all this stuff, but
[01:56:59.168 --> 01:57:07.653]  You know, I've said it before, all the gold in the hills is nothing compared to good friends, good family, and a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[01:57:09.054 --> 01:57:15.299]  So I do not want to be on my deathbed many years from now feeling guilty for things I've done.
[01:57:15.319 --> 01:57:21.803]  You know, faith without works is dead, folks, and if you're not working to fight evil, then you don't have God in you.
[01:57:22.526 --> 01:57:23.967]  All right, that really is enough of the preaching.
[01:57:24.007 --> 01:57:24.928]  I'm out of control here.
[01:57:25.309 --> 01:57:27.370]  We'll come back, take calls, cover a bunch of news.
[01:57:27.390 --> 01:57:29.612]  In fact, we'll cover news first, and then go to your calls.
[01:57:29.632 --> 01:57:30.033]  Stay with us.
[01:57:33.936 --> 01:57:38.960]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today, or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[01:57:50.166 --> 01:57:50.807]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.467 --> 01:57:52.568]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.248 --> 01:57:54.349]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.010 --> 01:57:55.850]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.571 --> 01:57:57.532]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.132 --> 01:58:02.075]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.335 --> 01:58:06.458]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:06.578 --> 01:58:09.981]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:19.691 --> 01:58:30.254]  We're now into hour number three of transmission against worldwide tyranny, and we're here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:58:30.834 --> 01:58:31.994]  I said I'm going straight to news.
[01:58:32.014 --> 01:58:34.975]  Let's talk to Steve and Xen, who are next up in line.
[01:58:35.415 --> 01:58:40.736]  Then I'm going to get into this plethora, this grab bag of vital news and information for a couple segments.
[01:58:40.756 --> 01:58:43.617]  Then we'll go back into calls for the balance of this broadcast.
[01:58:44.668 --> 01:58:47.729]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Florida.
[01:58:47.769 --> 01:58:49.430]  Go ahead, my Floridian friend.
[01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:50.930]  Yes, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:58:51.010 --> 01:58:51.870]  It's good to talk to you.
[01:58:51.890 --> 01:58:53.911]  I've been listening to your show for about two and a half years.
[01:58:53.991 --> 01:58:55.051]  I've got a couple of DVDs.
[01:58:55.071 --> 01:59:02.934]  I've been trying to wake up my family throughout the years, and I've been telling all my friends, and I've been talking to people about it, trying to wake people up.
[01:59:03.154 --> 01:59:03.834]  Well, that's great.
[01:59:04.154 --> 01:59:04.794]  Do me a favor.
[01:59:04.814 --> 01:59:06.675]  Talk right into your telephone so I can hear you.
[01:59:07.295 --> 01:59:09.036]  It hit me the other day when I was at the bank, Alex.
[01:59:09.136 --> 01:59:13.057]  I went to get a cashier's check for $3,068, which is not a huge amount of money.
[01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:16.275]  I've got a long-standing account with this bank.
[01:59:16.755 --> 01:59:17.536]  It's a good account.
[01:59:17.816 --> 01:59:19.818]  I was about to say, especially nowadays.
[01:59:19.858 --> 01:59:22.259]  I remember when $3,600 was a lot of money.
[01:59:22.820 --> 01:59:27.043]  Yeah, well, they called it a premier account, so there was no charge for the cashier's check.
[01:59:27.904 --> 01:59:29.365]  I presented my driver's license.
[01:59:29.425 --> 01:59:30.346]  They looked up the account.
[01:59:30.366 --> 01:59:32.488]  They said, we need a second form of ID.
[01:59:33.208 --> 01:59:34.169]  I said, why is that?
[01:59:34.649 --> 01:59:35.550]  Well, we just do.
[01:59:36.070 --> 01:59:37.532]  So then I continued to talk with them.
[01:59:37.572 --> 01:59:40.554]  And then five minutes later, they finally told you it's the Patriot Act.
[01:59:41.184 --> 01:59:42.387]  No, I asked them straight up.
[01:59:42.467 --> 01:59:43.950]  I said, listen, is that the Patriot Act?
[01:59:43.970 --> 01:59:44.872]  They said, yes, it is.
[01:59:45.534 --> 01:59:49.502]  I said, well, what's the limit for the amount of money where I would need a second form of ID?
[01:59:49.823 --> 01:59:51.968]  They told me that they weren't allowed to tell me.
[01:59:53.274 --> 01:59:54.114]  My heart started racing.
[01:59:54.254 --> 01:59:58.436]  Really, it's know your customers, something the banks always wanted to do and couldn't get through.
[01:59:58.496 --> 02:00:05.259]  And again, they tell you the Patriot Act's never been used on citizens, isn't used, and they're arresting homeless people with it left and right.
[02:00:05.499 --> 02:00:07.320]  They're going into toy stores over it.
[02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:15.043]  It's a reign of terror, and they get up on the news and say it's never been used, when every day I see five articles!
[02:00:15.643 --> 02:00:22.106]  Yeah, well, it got used against me, and it goes further because of the fact that I brought in $3,000 cash for a small-scale truck
[02:00:23.388 --> 02:00:23.748]  Okay.
[02:00:24.088 --> 02:00:32.790]  I extracted $68 from my account, and they still need a second form of ID to put in a completely separate system, not part of the bank.
[02:00:34.771 --> 02:00:35.411]  Sir, I know.
[02:00:36.011 --> 02:00:42.633]  Listen, whether your wife goes in to get a diaphragm, or whether you go in to get prescription-strength ibuprofen,
[02:00:43.840 --> 02:00:46.063]  It is instantly uploaded to a federal database.
[02:00:46.103 --> 02:00:50.368]  And they were doing that five years ago, but now they passed the law Bush signed it two months ago.
[02:00:50.848 --> 02:00:57.336]  No Fourth Amendment, no inkling of freedom, not even a shadow of what was formerly there.
[02:00:57.877 --> 02:01:03.103]  And you talk to the average drooling idiot, and they'll tell you that no freedom has been taken.
[02:01:03.689 --> 02:01:03.869]  Yeah.
[02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:05.591]  And then they asked me for my social.
[02:01:05.771 --> 02:01:07.593]  Again, I said, isn't it on the account?
[02:01:07.633 --> 02:01:11.157]  Well, this is a... and they said, this is a separate system.
[02:01:11.197 --> 02:01:12.178]  We need your social security number.
[02:01:12.198 --> 02:01:13.479]  I said, I'm not going to give it to you.
[02:01:13.739 --> 02:01:15.040]  You can find it in the account.
[02:01:15.381 --> 02:01:19.164]  So they went through another ten minutes of, you know, bringing up the account information to find it.
[02:01:19.205 --> 02:01:20.005]  But I couldn't believe it.
[02:01:20.326 --> 02:01:21.086]  It finally hit me.
[02:01:21.106 --> 02:01:22.067]  I had to do my research.
[02:01:22.628 --> 02:01:23.569]  I've been listening to you.
[02:01:24.569 --> 02:01:27.971]  And it finally hit me yesterday and it just got me extremely angry.
[02:01:27.991 --> 02:01:28.571]  I had to call him.
[02:01:28.591 --> 02:01:32.253]  Sir, that goes right into a database to track the entire underground economy.
[02:01:32.613 --> 02:01:37.936]  Which with RF... Listen, every refrigerator, they're now coming out, is going to read RFID.
[02:01:39.165 --> 02:01:44.368]  And your trash cans, the new trash cans they're going to come out with that the city issues you, it's all part of a plan.
[02:01:44.388 --> 02:01:45.889]  That's why they got rid of them a few years ago.
[02:01:45.909 --> 02:01:49.291]  It's going to have a little reader chip on it with your ID number.
[02:01:49.311 --> 02:01:51.893]  When it dumps in the truck, it'll immediately read that.
[02:01:52.353 --> 02:01:57.736]  And when it goes to the landfill, so from the factory to the landfill, everything you do, it'll be like Google.
[02:01:57.836 --> 02:01:58.977]  Google will even be part of this.
[02:01:59.417 --> 02:02:02.679]  But it'll be a private index that only the government and corporations can see.
[02:02:03.199 --> 02:02:07.822]  Every movement you made, your entire history, it'll be an individualized cookie
[02:02:08.542 --> 02:02:12.785]  Just like with the net, attached to everything you do, buy, sell, trade, dump.
[02:02:13.345 --> 02:02:15.867]  Every dollar, every purchase, every bit of cash.
[02:02:16.887 --> 02:02:19.709]  And then, Neil Bortz promotes this, the other part of the puzzle.
[02:02:20.169 --> 02:02:23.611]  A new national sales tax, but they're going to keep the income tax along with it.
[02:02:24.072 --> 02:02:26.753]  Mesh the two with the swipe of the National ID card.
[02:02:27.294 --> 02:02:30.916]  At every purchase point, that'll be total integration of the slave grid.
[02:02:31.776 --> 02:02:35.799]  Which is why I should write a book about RFID, because other people aren't getting the full picture.
[02:02:36.815 --> 02:02:37.616]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:37.736 --> 02:02:38.436]  Thank you for the call.
[02:02:38.456 --> 02:02:38.856]  Stay with us.
[02:02:46.862 --> 02:02:49.704]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.964 --> 02:02:50.664]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.765 --> 02:02:51.525]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.885 --> 02:02:56.568]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.909 --> 02:03:01.332]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.752 --> 02:03:05.915]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:06.135 --> 02:03:08.996]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:09.076 --> 02:03:13.737]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.938 --> 02:03:18.359]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.579 --> 02:03:25.781]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[02:03:47.532 --> 02:03:48.574]  The War on Terrorism.
[02:03:48.914 --> 02:03:51.698]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[02:03:51.959 --> 02:03:56.125]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:03:56.545 --> 02:03:57.366]  So what do you do?
[02:03:57.687 --> 02:04:02.274]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:04:02.734 --> 02:04:04.875]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:04:05.355 --> 02:04:20.059]  Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:20.099 --> 02:04:27.161]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:04:49.445 --> 02:04:57.828]  When natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach, hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:04:58.148 --> 02:05:06.071]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:06.211 --> 02:05:13.253]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:13.473 --> 02:05:14.675]  There are no side effects.

[02:05:18.280 --> 02:05:19.401]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:19.682 --> 02:05:20.964]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:21.164 --> 02:05:28.013]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:05:35.099 --> 02:05:39.080]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:41.021]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:06.405 --> 02:06:10.528]  Welcome back 8 minutes 25 seconds into this third hour.
[02:06:10.548 --> 02:06:15.692]  I'm going to plunge into the news now and then we'll go to Lauren and others coming up in a few minutes.
[02:06:15.712 --> 02:06:20.576]  The toll free number to join us on this live Wednesday edition the 12th day of October 2005 is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:20.616 --> 02:06:20.896]  That's 800-259-9231.
[02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:34.284]  Well, uh, there was a big public affairs poll done scientifically here.
[02:06:34.324 --> 02:06:36.166]  It says Americans want Bush impeached.
[02:06:36.187 --> 02:06:39.070]  And I'd say the numbers are even worse than this poll shows.
[02:06:39.130 --> 02:06:40.251]  This is out of Daily Kiosk.
[02:06:41.212 --> 02:06:44.817]  Americans favor Bush's impeachment if he lied about Iraq.
[02:06:44.837 --> 02:06:48.421]  Well, if he lied, it's like saying, did the sun come up this morning?
[02:06:48.521 --> 02:06:50.884]  Gee, you know, do I have two eyeballs?
[02:06:51.873 --> 02:07:03.215]  By a margin of 50 to 44, Americans want Congress to consider impeaching President Bush if he lied about the Iraq War, according to a new poll commissioned by the AfterDowningStreet.org.
[02:07:03.275 --> 02:07:04.276]  Well, he admittedly lied.
[02:07:05.656 --> 02:07:08.837]  A grassroots coalition that supports a congressional investigation.
[02:07:09.257 --> 02:07:14.838]  I love how... Let's go to the criminals and have a whitewash of President Bush's decision to invade Iraq in 2003.
[02:07:17.464 --> 02:07:19.865]  And it goes on into it.
[02:07:19.885 --> 02:07:23.807]  44% disagreed and 6% said they didn't know or declined to answer.
[02:07:23.847 --> 02:07:27.810]  The poll has a 3.1 margin of error, plus or minus.
[02:07:27.850 --> 02:07:32.732]  So, any way you cut it, the majority want Lord Bush impeached.
[02:07:33.372 --> 02:07:35.494]  Of course, most Americans don't know what impeachment even means.
[02:07:35.514 --> 02:07:36.574]  And I'm not being sardonic.
[02:07:36.854 --> 02:07:37.595]  That scares me.
[02:07:37.635 --> 02:07:39.756]  But most don't know, so how do you even know if this poll is right?
[02:07:40.376 --> 02:07:43.898]  Among those who felt strong either way, 39% strongly agreed while 30% strongly disagreed.
[02:07:47.173 --> 02:07:53.958]  The results of the poll are truly astonishing, said after Downing Street.org co-founder Bob Fredick.
[02:07:54.539 --> 02:08:01.905]  Bush's record low approval ratings tell us half the story, which is how much Americans oppose Bush's policies on Iraq and other issues.
[02:08:02.365 --> 02:08:11.112]  But this poll, the other half of the story, that a solid plurality of Americans want Congress to consider removing Bush from the White House.
[02:08:11.152 --> 02:08:11.352]  Yeah.
[02:08:11.733 --> 02:08:13.574]  What I do is what the politicians do.
[02:08:13.694 --> 02:08:14.435]  I will index
[02:08:15.723 --> 02:08:16.103]  Polls.
[02:08:16.123 --> 02:08:18.985]  I mean, I'll sit there and look at five polls and average them together.
[02:08:19.305 --> 02:08:20.066]  That's what you should do.
[02:08:20.106 --> 02:08:21.747]  That's where you really get accurate numbers.
[02:08:22.307 --> 02:08:23.688]  From totally different polling companies.
[02:08:23.748 --> 02:08:27.871]  And Bush right now has a 31% general approval rating.
[02:08:29.232 --> 02:08:30.373]  You'll watch CBS News.
[02:08:30.393 --> 02:08:30.833]  They'll say it's 40.
[02:08:31.213 --> 02:08:32.074]  You'll watch Fox.
[02:08:32.094 --> 02:08:34.356]  They'll use some poll and say it's 42.
[02:08:34.876 --> 02:08:36.117]  That's about as high as it gets.
[02:08:36.157 --> 02:08:37.598]  But you average the polls together.
[02:08:38.658 --> 02:08:40.640]  This guy is not doing well.
[02:08:40.700 --> 02:08:42.281]  Which I don't celebrate, by the way.
[02:08:43.798 --> 02:08:57.367]  If they had a poll about, do you like the New World Order, and 80% said they hated it, which they have had polls, people are for world government, the vast majority are against it, but if we had highly publicized polls like that, I'd be happy.
[02:08:57.887 --> 02:09:03.051]  Bush is a puppet, a little nothing, and we've always got to remember that.
[02:09:03.071 --> 02:09:12.537]  I mean, the last two years of Bill Clinton's presidency, I got a lot of flack, because as much as I hate Bill Clinton, he's a horrible, rapist, weapons-selling demon.
[02:09:13.536 --> 02:09:15.297]  A dope dealing demon.
[02:09:16.277 --> 02:09:19.418]  Involved in murders all over Arkansas, clearly.
[02:09:19.558 --> 02:09:20.698]  I mean, we've interviewed the police.
[02:09:21.338 --> 02:09:22.119]  The state troopers.
[02:09:22.799 --> 02:09:29.001]  I mean, we've interviewed state troopers who, you know, saw the videotape of other state troopers beating somebody almost to death.
[02:09:29.041 --> 02:09:33.342]  He's now in a wheelchair just because he saw flowers and Clinton going in the apartment.
[02:09:33.382 --> 02:09:35.062]  I mean, you know, I don't like that.
[02:09:35.122 --> 02:09:40.824]  You may think it's cute because you're a bug-eyed liberal, but it's time for you to wake up and stop loving Bill Clinton.
[02:09:41.744 --> 02:09:43.165]  Again, Bill Clinton's just a puppet.
[02:09:43.185 --> 02:09:53.709]  If we let all this anger and all this concern deflect off the globalists onto Clinton and Bush and Hillary or Swartzy or whoever's coming, it's just gonna get worse and worse.
[02:09:55.210 --> 02:09:55.830]  Alright, that's enough.
[02:09:55.870 --> 02:09:56.350]  I gotta hurry.
[02:09:57.291 --> 02:10:01.833]  Genetically modified crops ruin fields for 15 years.
[02:10:04.874 --> 02:10:08.736]  Now, we know that genetically engineered crops jump into other species,
[02:10:10.484 --> 02:10:17.966]  We know not only do genetically engineered crops have little or no food value, they're also downright toxic.
[02:10:18.687 --> 02:10:27.069]  Now, Lord Limbaugh and others will say, hey, George Washington Carver crossing three species of tomato, that's genetic engineering.
[02:10:27.529 --> 02:10:29.950]  Breeds of dogs are genetic engineering.
[02:10:29.990 --> 02:10:32.471]  It's almost as if they get talking points.
[02:10:32.571 --> 02:10:35.352]  I hear the same thing out of Hannity, Limbaugh, all of them.
[02:10:37.512 --> 02:10:37.913]  Well, no.
[02:10:37.973 --> 02:10:44.900]  You're taking the original DNA that is in the species, that's always been in the species, of Canine Familiaris.
[02:10:46.081 --> 02:10:47.323]  Or, the dog.
[02:10:48.564 --> 02:10:52.889]  And you are then just simply manipulating traits already there.
[02:10:53.890 --> 02:10:56.913]  That's not genetic engineering, folks, in its true sense.
[02:10:57.501 --> 02:11:15.588]  When you take, say, another plant gene and inject it into a tomato or a potato, or you take a whole different animal gene and put it in plant gene and create a chimera like that, or maybe put five different genes from five different animals in a tomato, man, you're talking deadly!
[02:11:16.300 --> 02:11:21.965]  And we've had the top scientists on over and over again, guys who were at the heads of major biotech companies and quit.
[02:11:22.425 --> 02:11:23.926]  Or, you know, went public and got fired.
[02:11:24.306 --> 02:11:25.767]  We've had a bunch of them on over the years.
[02:11:25.808 --> 02:11:26.948]  I ought to do a whole week with them.
[02:11:27.409 --> 02:11:37.477]  When you go in and change actual genes, it creates new proteins, new amino acids that never existed, and are deadly poison in the body.
[02:11:37.557 --> 02:11:38.417]  I mean, poisonous!
[02:11:39.979 --> 02:11:43.962]  And, I mean, you get just... I mean, you're not just talking about not getting your value, folks.
[02:11:44.202 --> 02:11:45.363]  We're talking about poison.
[02:11:47.276 --> 02:11:51.578]  And it's hard to find food that hasn't got chimera status.
[02:11:52.798 --> 02:12:03.902]  Even the stuff they claim is organic, there's a lot of cheating going on, and now the organic stuff is being contaminated, the actual gene line, by the tomato that has been chimera-ed.
[02:12:04.622 --> 02:12:05.882]  That has been cross-specied.
[02:12:06.163 --> 02:12:11.604]  You say chimera from the Greek god that had the head of a goat, the head of a dragon, and the head of a lion was it?
[02:12:11.664 --> 02:12:12.785]  I forget.
[02:12:12.825 --> 02:12:13.885]  But that was the chimera.
[02:12:14.165 --> 02:12:15.926]  My past grandmother,
[02:12:17.427 --> 02:12:19.428]  Good old Patti Jones.
[02:12:20.329 --> 02:12:28.256]  When I was little in the summer visiting her, or in the winter visiting, I'd lay in bed with her and she'd read me Greek classics.
[02:12:28.296 --> 02:12:29.897]  I remember my favorite was the Chimera.
[02:12:31.358 --> 02:12:32.339]  Side issue.
[02:12:32.359 --> 02:12:33.380]  I think about her all the time.
[02:12:35.061 --> 02:12:38.945]  Anyways, there's a reason I've been thinking about dead family a lot lately.
[02:12:39.005 --> 02:12:42.488]  I hope somebody isn't getting ready to die or something.
[02:12:43.288 --> 02:12:44.529]  I pray to God that doesn't happen.
[02:12:46.002 --> 02:12:51.085]  Anyways, to make a long story short, see, I digress off into the Greek legend of the chimera.
[02:12:52.846 --> 02:13:04.472]  But, um, the point is, is that I know you're listening, you listen to Lord Lumbaugh, Well, Rushfield, that's like my Chihuahua, there ain't no problem.
[02:13:05.132 --> 02:13:06.613]  We're not talking about that.
[02:13:06.693 --> 02:13:13.377]  We're not talking about splicing just by pollinization or by grafting two different corn plants.
[02:13:15.140 --> 02:13:18.981]  We're not talking about what George Washington Carver did contributing so much.
[02:13:20.141 --> 02:13:22.902]  So please don't take great men like him and mix him in with what you're doing.
[02:13:23.422 --> 02:13:31.103]  Taking spider genes and engineering it where the udders of the goat becomes a spinneret.
[02:13:32.604 --> 02:13:35.064]  I mean a literal spider part hanging off a goat.
[02:13:35.864 --> 02:13:38.165]  Buddy, that isn't George Washington Carver.
[02:13:40.143 --> 02:13:53.710]  And now they're about to approve cloned meat, cloned milk, and I've got the studies literally out the wazoo that just, just, just coming out my ears here, folks, of how deadly this is.
[02:13:53.770 --> 02:14:00.554]  I mean, you change one potato gene, any of them, deadly poison, and they don't care.
[02:14:01.194 --> 02:14:02.435]  They do their own internal studies.
[02:14:02.475 --> 02:14:03.535]  The rats all die.
[02:14:03.555 --> 02:14:05.736]  They live about a third as long.
[02:14:05.816 --> 02:14:06.237]  So what?
[02:14:06.297 --> 02:14:06.717]  Approve it.
[02:14:07.276 --> 02:14:10.317]  Rumsfeld, Aspartame, Rumsfeld, this new flu pill.
[02:14:10.617 --> 02:14:11.317]  Just all of it.
[02:14:11.377 --> 02:14:16.398]  It never ends with these people.
[02:14:16.418 --> 02:14:17.339]  And they're also jumping in.
[02:14:17.379 --> 02:14:22.700]  I mean, they'll walk up to oak trees now here in Texas and some weird corn plant's growing out of the side that's been on the news.
[02:14:23.480 --> 02:14:24.540]  Never before been seen.
[02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:35.203]  Because they change the basic infrastructure, the basic superstructure, or I should say the basic scaffolding, the basic skeleton of
[02:14:37.370 --> 02:14:40.971]  of these systems, and it's wide open.
[02:14:41.011 --> 02:14:42.151]  It starts collapsing.
[02:14:43.671 --> 02:14:49.032]  You know, it starts letting out all of these millions of years of design.
[02:14:49.072 --> 02:14:50.393]  I believe that's how God designed it.
[02:14:50.433 --> 02:14:58.354]  I don't think there's an argument between... Science creates false arguments to criticize Christianity, and we're dumb enough to fall into it.
[02:14:58.594 --> 02:15:01.235]  The point is, I've talked to the top genome experts, okay?
[02:15:01.475 --> 02:15:04.296]  They thought the 4% was all there was, and they could control it.
[02:15:04.516 --> 02:15:05.236]  They found out that 96%
[02:15:07.222 --> 02:15:09.963]  Do you know what is in human genes, confirmed, documented?
[02:15:10.243 --> 02:15:11.363]  Prehistoric crocodile.
[02:15:12.544 --> 02:15:17.546]  Now why is the complete genome of the prehistoric crocodile just sitting there in one little piece of our DNA?
[02:15:18.626 --> 02:15:20.186]  All literally compressed.
[02:15:20.226 --> 02:15:25.708]  Now if we have supercomputers that can look at this, just like supercomputers use massive compression, it's all compressed.
[02:15:26.028 --> 02:15:28.949]  Why do we have all these other species in our DNA?
[02:15:30.050 --> 02:15:31.830]  And the other species, the same thing.
[02:15:34.071 --> 02:15:36.532]  It's just the majesty of it.
[02:15:38.954 --> 02:15:44.681]  And now suddenly a lot of top scientists are suddenly getting religion, folks, because they look at this and they go, my God, this was engineered.
[02:15:45.181 --> 02:15:47.464]  And this was engineered by stuff that we can't even imagine.
[02:15:48.625 --> 02:15:50.127]  This is so advanced.
[02:15:50.508 --> 02:15:57.636]  And so they just go in and they just change a whole area of it, and yeah, they can get the change they want, but then a thousand other things start changing.
[02:16:01.678 --> 02:16:07.663]  GM crops, and a lot of scientists are now saying, that's medical doctors folks, that's why allergies are getting so bad.
[02:16:07.983 --> 02:16:10.826]  My 80-year-old grandmother has never had allergies, has them now.
[02:16:11.786 --> 02:16:13.228]  Never had allergies, she's got them now.
[02:16:13.728 --> 02:16:14.889]  Everybody I know has got them.
[02:16:15.129 --> 02:16:25.257]  And the science is now showing it's the GM foods and everything is triggering them in us, and now it's colliding with stuff in the outside we were always able to deal with, and that's why it's getting so bad.
[02:16:26.418 --> 02:16:30.262]  So I struggle not to eat stuff that isn't organic, but how do you do it?
[02:16:34.187 --> 02:16:37.811]  I know I'm ranting here, but I mean, this is... Here's the new article.
[02:16:39.212 --> 02:16:40.473]  And there's a couple of these every day.
[02:16:40.513 --> 02:16:41.294]  I never even cover them.
[02:16:41.334 --> 02:16:41.634]  I should.
[02:16:42.014 --> 02:16:46.158]  I should have segments of the show and just religiously keep myself to those sections.
[02:16:46.499 --> 02:16:48.160]  Now for the genetically modified section.
[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:49.502]  Now for the gun control section.
[02:16:50.062 --> 02:16:51.223]  Now for the torture section.
[02:16:52.324 --> 02:16:55.167]  GM crop ruins fields for 15 years.
[02:16:55.187 --> 02:16:56.108]  Mmm, yummy.
[02:16:58.300 --> 02:16:59.501]  This side of London Independent.
[02:16:59.721 --> 02:17:03.924]  GM crops contaminate the countryside for 15 years after they have been harvested.
[02:17:04.585 --> 02:17:06.546]  Startling new government research shows.
[02:17:07.507 --> 02:17:09.748]  Of course they try to keep the findings secret, but now they're public.
[02:17:10.049 --> 02:17:21.977]  The findings cast a cloud over the prospects of growing the modified crops in Britain, suggesting that farmers who try them out for one season will find fields blighted for a decade and a half.
[02:17:23.358 --> 02:17:24.399]  That's right, those little
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:28.202]  Those little spores live and survive in the dirt.
[02:17:29.123 --> 02:17:30.544]  Just like the body snatchers.
[02:17:32.005 --> 02:17:36.889]  Financed by GM companies and Margaret Beckett's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
[02:17:37.829 --> 02:17:38.870]  I will tell you about it when we get back.
[02:17:39.351 --> 02:17:41.812]  Covering a bunch of other news, I better hurry, we'll never get to it all.
[02:17:45.905 --> 02:17:48.846]  You can live for weeks without food and days without water.
[02:17:48.966 --> 02:17:51.186]  But without oxygen, you would be dead in minutes.
[02:17:51.547 --> 02:17:53.567]  Oxygen is truly the breath of life.
[02:17:53.707 --> 02:17:56.168]  Where oxygen is abundant, disease cannot live.
[02:17:56.248 --> 02:17:59.269]  But where oxygen is deficient, disease will thrive.
[02:17:59.449 --> 02:18:00.689]  Are you getting enough oxygen?
[02:18:00.889 --> 02:18:06.331]  If you spend much time indoors or live in an urban area, you're probably oxygen deficient and don't even know it.
[02:18:06.411 --> 02:18:11.012]  This makes you vulnerable to all types of chronic disease, as well as undue emotional stress.
[02:18:11.312 --> 02:18:17.517]  Clearly, increasing your body's oxygen level without negative side effects is critical to attaining good health and a sense of well-being.
[02:18:17.737 --> 02:18:23.602]  This is especially true for smokers, those with respiratory disorders, athletes, and all health-minded individuals.
[02:18:23.962 --> 02:18:29.727]  The Un-Medical Miracle Oxygen is a book that will show you safe, easy ways to increase your body's oxygen level.

[02:18:38.334 --> 02:18:38.755]  That's 888-224-7416.
[02:18:46.934 --> 02:18:51.437]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:51.777 --> 02:18:55.859]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:56.159 --> 02:18:56.720]  We listened.
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:19:02.002]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:02.283 --> 02:19:02.763]  We listened.
[02:19:03.143 --> 02:19:06.185]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:06.605 --> 02:19:07.145]  We listened.
[02:19:07.606 --> 02:19:11.648]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[02:19:12.048 --> 02:19:12.528]  We listened.
[02:19:12.869 --> 02:19:18.112]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[02:19:18.513 --> 02:19:19.894]  Again, we listened.
[02:19:20.254 --> 02:19:27.639]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[02:19:28.019 --> 02:19:31.462]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[02:19:37.501 --> 02:19:41.124]  That's toll free 888-803-4438.
[02:19:41.984 --> 02:19:43.385]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:44.226 --> 02:19:48.368]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:19:48.769 --> 02:19:54.252]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[02:19:54.833 --> 02:19:55.313]  That's right.
[02:19:55.633 --> 02:19:57.935]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[02:19:58.235 --> 02:20:05.400]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[02:20:05.948 --> 02:20:13.651]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[02:20:14.091 --> 02:20:18.953]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[02:20:19.574 --> 02:20:22.595]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:25.376 --> 02:20:29.521]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[02:20:29.902 --> 02:20:30.142]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:30.162 --> 02:20:32.085]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[02:20:32.165 --> 02:20:32.465]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:32.765 --> 02:20:33.046]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:20:45.706 --> 02:20:52.594]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[02:20:52.734 --> 02:21:05.668]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[02:21:05.848 --> 02:21:07.630]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[02:21:07.810 --> 02:21:11.272]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[02:21:11.552 --> 02:21:15.334]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[02:21:15.594 --> 02:21:20.557]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[02:21:20.817 --> 02:21:22.538]  So take matters into your own hands.
[02:21:22.798 --> 02:21:26.760]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.
[02:21:27.020 --> 02:21:28.881]  Dango is what you are looking for.
[02:21:29.041 --> 02:21:33.684]  Find out more by calling 888-203-6633 or visit MangosteenMarket.com.
[02:21:33.704 --> 02:21:34.925]  That's M-A-N-G-O-S-T-E-E-N Market.com.
[02:21:35.165 --> 02:21:35.806]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[02:21:35.866 --> 02:21:36.546]  Let me ask,
[02:21:54.802 --> 02:21:58.903]  The yuppie out there giggling and laughing right now about genetically modified crops being bad.
[02:22:00.724 --> 02:22:02.444]  Do you really care about your children?
[02:22:02.504 --> 02:22:04.085]  I mean, you shouldn't laugh at this.
[02:22:04.125 --> 02:22:05.825]  You should do research and find out it's true.
[02:22:06.646 --> 02:22:14.468]  Again, the government said that Prozac was good for you when they knew it was toxic and massively increased suicides and psychotic breaks.
[02:22:15.568 --> 02:22:21.490]  They knew that Ritalin caused heart attacks, heart palpitations, brain shrinkage, retardation of growth,
[02:22:22.350 --> 02:22:23.251]  Major problems.
[02:22:23.531 --> 02:22:24.831]  Still, more kids on it than ever.
[02:22:26.132 --> 02:22:40.599]  They know that MSG passes the blood-brain barrier, is an artificial salt, a totally different molecule, tastes hyper-salty to the tongue, just, I guess, like antifreeze tastes good to a cat or dog.
[02:22:40.659 --> 02:22:41.400]  It still kills them.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:46.723]  And, you know, you eat that and it causes... I mean, if I eat any of it, folks, I swell up like a giant toad.
[02:22:47.903 --> 02:22:50.304]  Literally, it's like being stung by a bunch of wasps or something.
[02:22:51.966 --> 02:22:53.147]  They still put it in the food.
[02:22:53.307 --> 02:22:58.890]  Why do they insist on putting aspartame and wood alcohol and all this in the food?
[02:23:02.052 --> 02:23:05.794]  Why do they insist on pushing this and creating this?
[02:23:08.435 --> 02:23:09.996]  I mean, why does the government have
[02:23:10.808 --> 02:23:14.232]  Have hit men that serve it, that'll kill anybody the government tells them to.
[02:23:14.652 --> 02:23:20.999]  Those guys are probably listening to the show right now, but you've got children at home and you're just letting them suck up all this poison.
[02:23:21.500 --> 02:23:24.122]  I mean, what is your major malfunction?
[02:23:26.545 --> 02:23:27.506]  And look, we already knew this.
[02:23:27.566 --> 02:23:32.812]  It says that for 15 years, and they've done now the 15 year study, they did it all over the country, the government did themselves,
[02:23:33.544 --> 02:23:52.869]  If you plant canola, or you plant any of this genetically modified corn, maize, any of it, for 15 years, it is in the dirt, and when you plant other seeds there, then the pollen or the volunteer seeds, they call it rape crops, because it literally comes in and takes over the other plants.
[02:23:53.329 --> 02:23:56.870]  Rape plants would grow in every square meter of an affected area, it says.
[02:23:58.706 --> 02:24:04.670]  So in every square meter, a large portion of the plants would be partially genetically modified.
[02:24:04.830 --> 02:24:07.772]  That is, partially the original organism that had been altered.
[02:24:08.572 --> 02:24:12.395]  Or there would just be complete plants growing of the other species.
[02:24:12.855 --> 02:24:15.897]  Then you can't sell your crop, because they're going to test it.
[02:24:16.177 --> 02:24:17.498]  The organic people are going to test it.
[02:24:17.518 --> 02:24:18.899]  They're going to find traces in it.
[02:24:19.711 --> 02:24:26.976]  And what was it, five years ago they had a Monsanto brag at a public meeting at a big GM conference up in Chicago.
[02:24:26.996 --> 02:24:33.500]  It was even in the major publication, what is it, National Geographic.
[02:24:34.061 --> 02:24:37.063]  Just, oh, we're just going to infect everything and then you won't have a choice.
[02:24:37.323 --> 02:24:38.403]  And it was a big laugh.
[02:24:38.463 --> 02:24:39.524]  Ha ha ha!
[02:24:40.025 --> 02:24:42.306]  Man, we're going to infect every plant!
[02:24:42.746 --> 02:24:44.307]  And there'll be nothing you can do.
[02:24:44.347 --> 02:24:45.368]  You'll have to eat it.
[02:24:46.048 --> 02:24:48.210]  You'll have to eat it too, you psychopath!
[02:24:49.392 --> 02:24:51.133]  I mean, what's wrong with these people?
[02:24:51.253 --> 02:24:54.336]  What is the major malfunction?
[02:24:54.356 --> 02:24:55.977]  This goes to everything we talk about.
[02:24:57.358 --> 02:24:59.920]  They know DU is deadly for the Tribs.
[02:24:59.960 --> 02:25:03.442]  Their own manuals on it, written in the 80s, early 90s.
[02:25:03.462 --> 02:25:06.284]  We've had the head of their DU program on, Dr. Rocky, many times.
[02:25:08.286 --> 02:25:10.067]  They know.
[02:25:11.268 --> 02:25:14.650]  They know for a fact Aspartame and all this is bad.
[02:25:14.991 --> 02:25:16.732]  They know for a fact
[02:25:17.512 --> 02:25:21.393]  That genetically modified crops, the chimera type, are deadly.
[02:25:22.033 --> 02:25:24.774]  They know what they're doing is horrible.
[02:25:27.174 --> 02:25:27.995]  They don't care.
[02:25:28.055 --> 02:25:28.935]  They don't stop.
[02:25:29.055 --> 02:25:30.295]  What is wrong with these people?
[02:25:32.736 --> 02:25:35.756]  And that goes for just hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of issues.
[02:25:36.177 --> 02:25:38.037]  They're building a hellish world.
[02:25:40.589 --> 02:25:41.170]  It's amazing!
[02:25:41.210 --> 02:25:49.076]  I mean, is it really just that the corporate chieftains go, well, this will allow us to take over the entire world market, and so what if it's deadly poison and hurts a bunch of people, including ourselves?
[02:25:49.116 --> 02:25:49.936]  Let's just do it?
[02:25:51.958 --> 02:25:53.940]  I mean, there's gotta be rules to war.
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:55.201]  There always were in the past.
[02:25:55.261 --> 02:25:57.863]  Now it's just our own species warring against ourselves.
[02:26:00.785 --> 02:26:04.828]  You know, this is really a petty issue and doesn't matter, but it shows what a congenital liar he is.
[02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:08.011]  Schwarzenegger swore in written campaign pledges
[02:26:08.948 --> 02:26:13.310]  That he would not make any movies while he was governor or running for governor or in his next term.
[02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:18.152]  Well now he's going to start starring in two more movies.
[02:26:20.093 --> 02:26:26.215]  And this is being reported by big California papers and they don't even mention that it breaks his campaign promise.
[02:26:27.215 --> 02:26:29.576]  See, they don't even mention when they break promises now.
[02:26:29.636 --> 02:26:30.597]  It's like, oh so what?
[02:26:31.117 --> 02:26:32.878]  You have to remember that.
[02:26:34.618 --> 02:26:38.520]  Health officials say outbreak is inevitable and virus could spread.
[02:26:41.397 --> 02:26:46.421]  And just more incredible fear-mongering that we're hearing, not just from the government, but other patriots as well.
[02:26:47.262 --> 02:26:48.003]  It's all over.
[02:26:48.043 --> 02:26:48.703]  It's all over.
[02:26:48.823 --> 02:26:56.570]  And now, we could just think there's an outbreak, or they could just think maybe these flu cases are the new avian flu.
[02:26:57.071 --> 02:27:07.960]  Or there could be just a few cases, and then that's all they need for total lockdown, total police state, again, training us to accept the troops coming to our rescue, bathing us in martial law,
[02:27:08.701 --> 02:27:14.826]  And there'll be a bunch of patriots going along with it, just because they like to fearmonger and harangue people.
[02:27:17.609 --> 02:27:18.870]  And then accuse me of fearmongering.
[02:27:21.212 --> 02:27:24.475]  So, just absolutely classic.
[02:27:25.376 --> 02:27:26.377]  Totally classic.
[02:27:27.498 --> 02:27:29.319]  And we'll tell you about a bunch of other key issues.
[02:27:29.399 --> 02:27:33.182]  EU says internet could fall apart when we get back.
[02:27:33.223 --> 02:27:33.663]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.470 --> 02:27:39.479]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.401 --> 02:27:43.089]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.081 --> 02:27:49.463]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:27:49.703 --> 02:27:50.023]  Why?
[02:27:50.043 --> 02:27:52.985]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:27:53.065 --> 02:27:58.008]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.
[02:27:58.148 --> 02:28:07.854]  The all-natural ingredients in cardivite begin immediately working to increase metabolism in your heart muscle tissue, mitigating heart rhythm abnormalities, and improving oxygen and blood flow in the heart.
[02:28:08.034 --> 02:28:12.296]  Right now, as a special for GCN listeners, you'll get a four-month supply for only $99 plus shipping.
[02:28:13.797 --> 02:28:14.017]  I think?
[02:28:34.753 --> 02:28:34.973]  Thank you.
[02:28:46.324 --> 02:28:51.287]  Now, you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:28:51.587 --> 02:28:57.031]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:57.071 --> 02:29:01.374]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.694 --> 02:29:04.716]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:05.036 --> 02:29:08.458]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:29:08.778 --> 02:29:18.142]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.402 --> 02:29:21.903]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:22.143 --> 02:29:29.226]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.
[02:29:29.486 --> 02:29:31.709]  Get the Berkey Sport for only $39.00.
[02:29:31.949 --> 02:29:37.395]  Get two for $70.00 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:46.511 --> 02:29:54.436]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[02:29:55.017 --> 02:29:56.318]  What happened to those prices?
[02:29:56.858 --> 02:29:58.559]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[02:30:00.140 --> 02:30:06.124]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[02:30:06.565 --> 02:30:07.125]  The result?
[02:30:07.565 --> 02:30:08.826]  Inflation was born.
[02:30:09.326 --> 02:30:11.388]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[02:30:13.350 --> 02:30:14.254]  What can you do about it?
[02:30:14.676 --> 02:30:17.006]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[02:30:17.839 --> 02:30:23.164]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[02:30:23.584 --> 02:30:28.768]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[02:30:29.209 --> 02:30:31.711]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[02:30:31.731 --> 02:30:33.933]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[02:30:34.193 --> 02:30:36.635]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now!
[02:30:49.517 --> 02:30:52.038]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[02:30:52.519 --> 02:30:55.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.701 --> 02:30:59.223]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[02:30:59.623 --> 02:31:03.885]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[02:31:04.305 --> 02:31:08.448]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[02:31:09.448 --> 02:31:19.311]  You know, I've actually gotten lots of emails and lots of people walking up on the street asking for me to sing more Johnny Cash on air.
[02:31:20.291 --> 02:31:21.952]  You don't really want that, do you?
[02:31:23.432 --> 02:31:24.553]  Gotta have some fun with it.
[02:31:25.813 --> 02:31:35.416]  But let's just go ahead and go back to the news and we'll go to Lawrence, Steve, Frank and others.
[02:31:37.043 --> 02:31:45.105]  When I do go to your calls, I'm going to go very quickly, 1-800-259-9231, to have your questions, comments ready.
[02:31:46.466 --> 02:31:50.867]  EU says internet could fall apart, and this is out of London Guardian.
[02:31:51.887 --> 02:31:52.888]  Let's just stop right there.
[02:31:55.488 --> 02:31:57.829]  If you type in the internet is dead into Google,
[02:31:58.803 --> 02:32:01.364]  At least a few weeks ago, you'll get all these symposiums.
[02:32:01.884 --> 02:32:04.365]  Internet 2 in Austin last year.
[02:32:04.925 --> 02:32:06.865]  Internet 2 the year before in London.
[02:32:07.366 --> 02:32:08.626]  Internet 2 in France.
[02:32:09.346 --> 02:32:10.406]  What is Internet 2?
[02:32:10.487 --> 02:32:11.627]  Well, it's not your friend.
[02:32:12.907 --> 02:32:14.328]  There's a lot of people working on it.
[02:32:14.348 --> 02:32:17.169]  They're going to take umbrage with that and go, I'm not bad!
[02:32:17.189 --> 02:32:19.269]  I didn't say you were bad!
[02:32:21.470 --> 02:32:28.372]  I'm saying that the guiding minds, the plan, the architecture of it is mouille ombre
[02:32:29.491 --> 02:32:29.791]  Bad.
[02:32:30.532 --> 02:32:30.912]  Okay?
[02:32:32.874 --> 02:32:33.454]  And it's simple.
[02:32:33.474 --> 02:32:35.156]  Let's say we had a free highway.
[02:32:35.216 --> 02:32:36.016]  Everybody was using it.
[02:32:36.036 --> 02:32:36.897]  It was working great.
[02:32:40.179 --> 02:32:53.370]  And then a private group went and paid off the government to stop fixing that highway and to pay them to build a private one that you wouldn't have any free speech on and would cost many times as much as the original.
[02:32:55.382 --> 02:32:57.123]  And that is exactly what they announced.
[02:32:57.284 --> 02:32:59.205]  They are going to turn off the old internet.
[02:32:59.245 --> 02:33:06.450]  They are going to stop peering agreements, which you just saw last week, that couple with Time Warner blocking our ISP.
[02:33:06.490 --> 02:33:07.411]  They did that separately.
[02:33:07.431 --> 02:33:08.131]  They've been doing that.
[02:33:08.151 --> 02:33:09.833]  So it's two things there, folks.
[02:33:10.413 --> 02:33:18.599]  But Level 3 and Cogent, just Level 3 said, I'm not going to let you share data with us as hubs of the internet.
[02:33:20.480 --> 02:33:22.342]  Well, the Internet2 crowd just says they're
[02:33:23.044 --> 02:33:31.890]  Talk to the big universities and the big peer-to-peer hubs, and they're just not going to update or fix it anymore.
[02:33:32.190 --> 02:33:38.415]  And all new developments, all new Sun Microsystems and Cisco Systems connections are going to be built.
[02:33:38.515 --> 02:33:41.217]  And the new highway is going to be built on Internet, too.
[02:33:41.717 --> 02:33:51.304]  And in the new Internet, you're so addicted to the old Internet, they're going to selectively give the big chunks to Time Warner and selectively give the big chunks to universities and to DARPA.
[02:33:52.918 --> 02:33:54.279]  Who started it all to begin with.
[02:33:54.939 --> 02:33:56.360]  Again, it's always been theirs.
[02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:57.400]  They get us addicted.
[02:33:57.440 --> 02:33:58.761]  They get us used to using it.
[02:33:59.101 --> 02:34:00.221]  They get us prepared.
[02:34:00.781 --> 02:34:02.922]  And now, boy, they have big symposiums.
[02:34:02.962 --> 02:34:06.844]  And they're already... It's not breaking down fast enough for them.
[02:34:06.864 --> 02:34:11.006]  So they're already, kind of like the internet's in a HAL 9000.
[02:34:11.546 --> 02:34:13.447]  They're just already flipping switches.
[02:34:13.667 --> 02:34:14.587]  They're turning them off.
[02:34:14.628 --> 02:34:17.909]  And there's millions of switches, but they're just flip, flip, flip, flip, flip.
[02:34:18.513 --> 02:34:20.214]  And the Internet's having more and more problems.
[02:34:20.275 --> 02:34:23.337]  And already, Japan's off the Internet for five days.
[02:34:23.417 --> 02:34:24.738]  China's off for a week and a half.
[02:34:25.078 --> 02:34:26.179]  India for three days.
[02:34:26.540 --> 02:34:28.941]  Whole sections of our Internet gone for days.
[02:34:29.722 --> 02:34:32.224]  And it's all being done by design.
[02:34:32.244 --> 02:34:35.887]  I've talked to a bunch of IT people, but forget what they say agreeing with me.
[02:34:36.427 --> 02:34:39.650]  We've got Internet 2 slime bags admitting it.
[02:34:41.571 --> 02:34:42.772]  Let me tell you how this is going to work.
[02:34:43.033 --> 02:34:45.715]  It will be needed out at first of 50 domains.
[02:34:46.954 --> 02:34:52.376]  So you'll be Time Warner slash Infowars dot whatever.
[02:34:53.476 --> 02:35:00.238]  And if you don't fit their rules, and you don't fit what their spiders are scanning for, no, they decide if you get on the internet.
[02:35:00.258 --> 02:35:02.779]  You'll have to pay exorbitant prices!
[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:06.820]  And they're doing it.
[02:35:07.401 --> 02:35:08.381]  And they're doing it right now.
[02:35:09.477 --> 02:35:12.339]  You didn't think they'd just let us take over and wake everybody up, did you?
[02:35:12.599 --> 02:35:14.620]  You didn't think they were just going to let us have free speech.
[02:35:15.060 --> 02:35:16.781]  They're attacking the net from a hundred different angles.
[02:35:17.581 --> 02:35:19.582]  EU says internet could fall apart.
[02:35:20.323 --> 02:35:28.067]  A battle has erupted over who governs the internet with America demanding to maintain a key role in the network it helped create and other countries demanding more control.
[02:35:28.447 --> 02:35:30.628]  And they're having a fake left-right fight just like
[02:35:31.897 --> 02:35:40.440]  The EU and the UN are against taking over Iraq and the evil Americans are for it, but oh now they're for it and now they're going to help police and run it.
[02:35:43.161 --> 02:35:45.802]  Same financial interests control and run the Internet.
[02:35:48.043 --> 02:35:51.164]  The same companies and same families that own Europe own America.
[02:35:51.964 --> 02:35:54.345]  But they don't want you to know that it's the same entity.
[02:35:54.725 --> 02:36:00.007]  They make you think that there's two different creatures, when only it is two different hands.
[02:36:02.438 --> 02:36:03.498]  And this is what they're doing!
[02:36:04.439 --> 02:36:14.043]  And now they're acting like, because we don't have a global body running it, why that's going to cause the problems, and why Europe's going to start shutting us out, and so is China.
[02:36:14.063 --> 02:36:16.064]  Well, that's what they wanted to begin with.
[02:36:16.084 --> 02:36:17.464]  They don't want the free speech over there.
[02:36:19.625 --> 02:36:26.808]  The European Commission is warning that if a deal cannot be reached at the meeting in Tunisia next month, the Internet will split apart.
[02:36:28.556 --> 02:36:29.937]  That issue is the role of the U.S.
[02:36:29.977 --> 02:36:33.540]  Government in overseeing the Internet's address structure called the Domain Name System.
[02:36:33.840 --> 02:36:35.121]  Oh yeah, the U.N.
[02:36:35.161 --> 02:36:37.183]  wants to decide whether you can own a domain name.
[02:36:37.423 --> 02:36:38.904]  Which again, fits into Internet 2.
[02:36:40.645 --> 02:36:43.768]  Which enables communication, but I mean, already you go to the U.N.
[02:36:43.788 --> 02:36:47.430]  and when somebody gets Madonna.com and she doesn't like it, she goes to the U.N.
[02:36:47.450 --> 02:36:49.692]  and they take it away from the person that has it and give it to her.
[02:36:52.434 --> 02:36:56.057]  Well sorry lady, there was something called the Madonna long before you came slithering along.
[02:36:56.917 --> 02:36:59.698]  That issue is the role... Yeah, they took it from a Catholic site.
[02:37:00.218 --> 02:37:01.659]  That issue is the role of the U.S.
[02:37:01.699 --> 02:37:08.001]  government in overseeing the Internet's address structure, called the Domain Name System, which enables communication between the world's computers.
[02:37:08.542 --> 02:37:14.644]  It is managed by a California-based, not-for-profit Internet corporation for assigned names and numbers, ICANN.
[02:37:15.427 --> 02:37:16.747]  Under contract with the U.S.
[02:37:16.767 --> 02:37:17.668]  Department of Commerce.
[02:37:17.708 --> 02:37:30.552]  A meeting of officials in Geneva last month was meant to formulate a way of sharing Internet governance with politicians that unveiled the U.N.-sponsored World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis in November 16-18.
[02:37:31.432 --> 02:37:43.076]  A European Union plan that goes a long way to meeting the demands of developing countries to make the governance more open collapsed in the face of U.S.
[02:37:43.803 --> 02:37:44.303]  Opposition.
[02:37:44.623 --> 02:37:46.224]  I've read the UN plan.
[02:37:46.885 --> 02:37:48.725]  That's, by the way, our own State Department's plan.
[02:37:50.006 --> 02:37:51.347]  And do you know what it is?
[02:37:53.248 --> 02:37:55.709]  You do not criticize any religion.
[02:37:55.789 --> 02:37:57.310]  You do not criticize any group.
[02:37:57.490 --> 02:37:59.391]  It is exactly what they've got in Europe.
[02:38:00.031 --> 02:38:01.672]  No free speech.
[02:38:02.852 --> 02:38:10.556]  And you've got the ADL and others lobbying right here to shut down the speech on the web as well, and it is bad news.
[02:38:13.875 --> 02:38:17.158]  So, we're going to try to be on the cutting edge of whatever new systems come out.
[02:38:17.198 --> 02:38:18.498]  We'll try to force our way in.
[02:38:18.539 --> 02:38:20.500]  We'll file lawsuits when they pull this stuff.
[02:38:20.800 --> 02:38:22.822]  We'll try to force ourselves on the internet, too.
[02:38:23.342 --> 02:38:30.047]  But the number one thing is, when they start crashing this, we need all the bloggers, we need all the writers, all of you.
[02:38:31.425 --> 02:38:35.848]  We need the Declan McCulloughs of the world to go get what Internet 2 says they're going to do to us.
[02:38:36.208 --> 02:38:44.294]  I mean, they're conspiring in plain view to start shutting down the original Internet and force us onto their highway they own and control.
[02:38:45.255 --> 02:38:46.215]  With all the restrictions.
[02:38:47.116 --> 02:38:48.777]  No more Wild West, baby.
[02:38:50.498 --> 02:38:55.762]  This is all lined up for 2008 or so, because that's when Congress plans to start taxing and regulating.
[02:38:56.576 --> 02:38:59.578]  I mean, they're going to hit the old net with taxation, regulation, you name it.
[02:38:59.839 --> 02:39:04.182]  They're only going to let select corporations and private universities onto the new one.
[02:39:04.602 --> 02:39:06.424]  And then they're going to fold up the old one.
[02:39:07.385 --> 02:39:08.225]  It is so sick.
[02:39:09.586 --> 02:39:12.369]  And so I need all of you to write articles and create a buzz on this.
[02:39:12.949 --> 02:39:14.310]  You know, I can't do it all, folks.
[02:39:15.531 --> 02:39:20.015]  Again, I'm going to be doing this radio show today, two live TV shows, and then Coast to Coast AM.
[02:39:21.016 --> 02:39:22.577]  We're talking 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 hours of broadcast today.
[02:39:26.869 --> 02:39:28.630]  And I'm not complaining.
[02:39:28.710 --> 02:39:29.170]  I'm honored.
[02:39:29.210 --> 02:39:31.072]  But I can't go write an article about Internet 2.
[02:39:31.832 --> 02:39:32.633]  I just don't have the time.
[02:39:33.233 --> 02:39:34.914]  Now certainly, you can do the research and do it.
[02:39:35.174 --> 02:39:36.195]  You want to write us an article?
[02:39:36.255 --> 02:39:37.175]  If it's good, we'll post it.
[02:39:37.676 --> 02:39:43.019]  But regardless, we need everybody to start talking about this, so when they pull it, they don't get away with it.
[02:39:44.620 --> 02:39:48.542]  When they're going, yes, you'll have to go over to Internet 2, and they stampede everybody.
[02:39:48.582 --> 02:39:49.863]  As soon as Internet 2 is built,
[02:39:51.053 --> 02:39:52.913]  And it already is almost there.
[02:39:53.134 --> 02:39:58.515]  They will just shut the other one off and in a month stampede you with the new rules over there.
[02:40:00.075 --> 02:40:01.035]  Don't put up with it.
[02:40:01.075 --> 02:40:03.156]  I mean, entrepreneurs start companies.
[02:40:03.836 --> 02:40:05.396]  You know, for new switching hubs.
[02:40:06.697 --> 02:40:09.037]  You know, call it the free internet, the real internet.
[02:40:09.077 --> 02:40:11.078]  You know, they want to kill the old one?
[02:40:11.118 --> 02:40:13.118]  Let's announce we're building the real internet.
[02:40:16.899 --> 02:40:20.100]  But again, I guess the patriots are too busy sucking off little old ladies to
[02:40:20.902 --> 02:40:22.003]  Come up with any true vision.
[02:40:25.425 --> 02:40:25.965]  All right.
[02:40:28.707 --> 02:40:32.870]  Again, I don't even want to get the attention, I don't even want to get the praise for doing this.
[02:40:33.971 --> 02:40:35.552]  I'm a limited person.
[02:40:35.652 --> 02:40:37.593]  I know there's greater minds than I out there.
[02:40:38.374 --> 02:40:44.598]  There is a tide in the affairs of men when taking up the flood leads on to fortune, as Julius Caesar said, or was that Shakespeare?
[02:40:44.958 --> 02:40:45.759]  Talking about Caesar.
[02:40:46.536 --> 02:40:50.518]  You know, we can be blessed by doing the right thing at the same time.
[02:40:50.878 --> 02:40:52.799]  Whoever told you doing the right thing cost you.
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:54.500]  The long run, it don't.
[02:40:55.641 --> 02:40:56.722]  They use lower English.
[02:40:57.502 --> 02:40:57.982]  It don't.
[02:40:58.683 --> 02:40:59.063]  It ain't.
[02:41:03.985 --> 02:41:15.892]  Vivian Redding, European IT Commissioner, says that if a multilateral approach cannot be agreed, countries such as China, Russia, Brazil, and some Arab states could start operating their own versions of the Internet and
[02:41:16.539 --> 02:41:22.806]  The ambiguity that has made it such a success will disappear.
[02:41:25.469 --> 02:41:25.949]  Ubiquity.
[02:41:26.009 --> 02:41:27.050]  I can't even suddenly read.
[02:41:27.771 --> 02:41:28.712]  It's universal use.
[02:41:29.273 --> 02:41:34.519]  We have to have a platform where leaders of the world can express their thoughts about the Internet.
[02:41:35.179 --> 02:41:38.543]  Basically a huge piracy operation to restrict it and take control of it.
[02:41:39.858 --> 02:41:47.952]  If they have the impression that the Internet is dominated by one nation, and it does not belong to all the nations, and the result could be the Internet falls apart.
[02:41:47.972 --> 02:41:49.034]  The U.S.
[02:41:49.074 --> 02:41:53.762]  agrees that many of the states demanding a more open Internet are no fans of freedom of expression.
[02:41:56.778 --> 02:42:08.108]  Michael Gallagher, President Bush's Internet Advisor and Head of the International Telecommunications and Information Administration, believes they are seizing on the only central part of the system in an effort to exert control.
[02:42:08.468 --> 02:42:09.629]  That is absolutely true.
[02:42:10.290 --> 02:42:11.631]  They are looking for a handle.
[02:42:11.851 --> 02:42:13.232]  Yeah, and you're going to give it to them.
[02:42:13.853 --> 02:42:21.339]  Thinking that the DNS is the meaning of life, but the meaning of life lives within their own borders and the policies that they create there.
[02:42:22.423 --> 02:42:22.863]  The U.S.
[02:42:22.923 --> 02:42:34.387]  government, which funded the development of the Internet in the 1960s, said in June it intended to retain its role in overseeing ICANN while trying to set up Internet 2 and gutting it.
[02:42:37.449 --> 02:42:40.190]  But the answer is more free Internets.
[02:42:41.770 --> 02:42:49.513]  We need more... We need more hubs that are outside of their system.
[02:42:51.303 --> 02:42:52.784]  And that tie into those systems.
[02:42:54.164 --> 02:42:54.804]  I mean, it's simple.
[02:42:54.824 --> 02:42:56.325]  We need to grow more arteries.
[02:42:56.445 --> 02:43:04.247]  We've gotten bigger and they have not let the vascular structure have not grown.
[02:43:04.287 --> 02:43:07.688]  I mean, you start running more, you start lifting weights, you get bigger.
[02:43:07.748 --> 02:43:10.729]  You're going to grow a larger blood vessel mass.
[02:43:10.769 --> 02:43:13.350]  Your blood vessels are going to get bigger and fatter and juicier.
[02:43:14.330 --> 02:43:16.091]  And we need exactly that.
[02:43:16.969 --> 02:43:24.091]  And by the way, it's our government and the globalists, along with the EU, they're going to put the RFID into the internet and track everything you do.
[02:43:24.171 --> 02:43:27.771]  So this is all a stage fight, excuses to butcher the internet.
[02:43:29.112 --> 02:43:31.572]  We should never let Europe get their filthy hands on it.
[02:43:33.213 --> 02:43:39.334]  And it is true that DARPA, who are not very friendly people, but a great American scientist, did come up with this.
[02:43:39.394 --> 02:43:43.615]  But the people, by using it and building it, and building the web, created it.
[02:43:45.839 --> 02:43:47.199]  And I think they've underestimated.
[02:43:47.219 --> 02:43:50.200]  I think they've lost control and they can try to kill the Internet all day long.
[02:43:50.661 --> 02:43:51.361]  It's not going to work.
[02:43:52.241 --> 02:43:54.342]  The worst thing they could do would be shut it down for months.
[02:43:54.462 --> 02:43:56.062]  A new Internet would be built overnight.
[02:43:58.043 --> 02:43:58.923]  It's already going to happen.
[02:44:00.584 --> 02:44:01.484]  Hey, how about this?
[02:44:01.564 --> 02:44:04.625]  Mandela rules Earth with Clinton as deputy.
[02:44:04.665 --> 02:44:10.287]  Newsmax, former South African leader Nelson Mandela, should rule the world with Bill Clinton as his deputy.
[02:44:11.408 --> 02:44:12.468]  Yeah, both of them are killers.
[02:44:13.453 --> 02:44:19.518]  That's what respondents said when BBC online survey asked them who they would most likely be in charge of the planet.
[02:44:20.799 --> 02:44:22.060]  Nelson Mandela, number one.
[02:44:22.080 --> 02:44:22.661]  Bill Clinton.
[02:44:23.201 --> 02:44:24.022]  Dalai Lama.
[02:44:24.522 --> 02:44:26.303]  You know, I'm going to say something about the Dalai Lama.
[02:44:26.824 --> 02:44:30.887]  That guy was here in Austin a few months ago and I was in a restaurant.
[02:44:30.907 --> 02:44:35.891]  They had him up on TV and they said, what do you think about the war?
[02:44:35.951 --> 02:44:36.832]  Is it good or bad?
[02:44:37.012 --> 02:44:38.253]  Obviously it's not just.
[02:44:38.293 --> 02:44:40.115]  And obviously any quote Buddhist would be against it.
[02:44:40.135 --> 02:44:42.276]  And he said, oh, it may be just.
[02:44:42.336 --> 02:44:42.777]  It may be.
[02:44:43.712 --> 02:44:45.053]  Very calculated answer.
[02:44:45.534 --> 02:44:46.455]  Time will tell.
[02:44:46.615 --> 02:44:49.177]  But by saying it may be just, it may be, you say, oh yes.
[02:44:49.217 --> 02:44:56.724]  I mean, you're a politician, and what have you done for your people over in Tibet?
[02:44:57.364 --> 02:45:00.067]  With the disgusting communist Chinese feeding on you.
[02:45:01.368 --> 02:45:03.950]  By the way, forcing Tibetan women to marry Chinese.
[02:45:04.791 --> 02:45:06.853]  But you don't hear our liberal media decrying that.
[02:45:07.093 --> 02:45:07.674]  Oh no.
[02:45:08.074 --> 02:45:09.996]  They love destroying cultures.
[02:45:12.756 --> 02:45:14.017]  It's about what our culture has become.
[02:45:14.037 --> 02:45:15.338]  The peer pressure says that.
[02:45:15.358 --> 02:45:18.079]  None of us will have a culture, whether you're black, white, or polka dotted.
[02:45:19.380 --> 02:45:21.762]  Syrian Minister commits suicide!
[02:45:21.862 --> 02:45:26.565]  Syrian Interior Minister, Ghizaz Khanan, has committed suicide.
[02:45:26.585 --> 02:45:28.166]  If you believe that, I've got a bridge I want to sell you.
[02:45:28.486 --> 02:45:36.851]  The official news agency in Damascus says, a week after being interviewed by the United Nations about the assassination of a foreign leader, he committed suicide.
[02:45:37.768 --> 02:45:45.358]  Last message, Interior Minister Brigadier General Ghaiz Khanan committed suicide in his office before noon.
[02:45:45.438 --> 02:45:45.859]  Sure he did.
[02:45:45.879 --> 02:45:48.122]  The Syrian Arab News Agency reported.
[02:45:48.963 --> 02:45:51.907]  The authorities are carrying out the necessary investigation into the incident.
[02:45:55.569 --> 02:46:00.931]  He contacted voice of Lebanon radio station on Wednesday to give what he said was his final statement.
[02:46:01.291 --> 02:46:06.852]  I want to make it clear that our relation with our borders in Lebanon was based on love and mutual respect.
[02:46:07.292 --> 02:46:09.993]  We have served Lebanon's interests with honor and honesty, he said.
[02:46:10.453 --> 02:46:13.254]  He asked for his comments to be passed to other broadcast media.
[02:46:13.714 --> 02:46:20.556]  After serving in Lebanon, Cannon returned to Damascus as political intelligence chief in 2002 and joined the cabinet in 2004.
[02:46:21.776 --> 02:46:24.297]  UN findings, the UN report on the assassination
[02:46:25.431 --> 02:46:27.694]  Uh, is expected to be published before the end of October.
[02:46:30.496 --> 02:46:32.799]  Let's take a few calls, we'll come back and hit a few other news items.
[02:46:32.959 --> 02:46:35.681]  Lauren, Lauren, uh, where are you calling us from?
[02:46:36.422 --> 02:46:36.763]  How you doing?
[02:46:37.343 --> 02:46:37.403]  Al?
[02:46:37.443 --> 02:46:38.745]  Hi, where are you calling from?
[02:46:39.165 --> 02:46:40.366]  I'm calling from Edmonton, Alberta.
[02:46:40.646 --> 02:46:41.067]  Welcome!
[02:46:42.168 --> 02:46:47.373]  Uh, yesterday, last night on CNN, uh, Anderson Cooper, he was talking about weather manipulation.
[02:46:48.254 --> 02:46:48.995]  And he had shown
[02:46:49.741 --> 02:46:58.605]  The same picture I have on my website, AbbaTheWatchman.com, he showed the picture of the inside of the last hurricane with the little white strip coming straight down the inside.
[02:46:59.325 --> 02:47:02.727]  And he was explaining it as if it is happening.
[02:47:03.167 --> 02:47:08.449]  He wasn't explaining it as if, you know, this is just a bunch of, you know, blah blah blah, you know, like people making stuff up.
[02:47:08.509 --> 02:47:09.690]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[02:47:10.270 --> 02:47:13.792]  He was stating it last night as if lots of people are saying this is happening.
[02:47:14.432 --> 02:47:19.274]  Well, I'll tell you, on my website, you can go to it, like, every single time.
[02:47:19.767 --> 02:47:24.650]  An event like this happens, an earthquake in Asia, there's another heart spike.
[02:47:25.511 --> 02:47:26.732]  I mean, you can see it with your own eyes.
[02:47:26.992 --> 02:47:32.175]  Yeah, I know, but they're telling us Smurfs from Planet 18 are doing it instead of our own government.
[02:47:32.776 --> 02:47:33.856]  I appreciate your call.
[02:47:33.896 --> 02:47:34.797]  Send me a link to that.
[02:47:36.058 --> 02:47:36.798]  I wasn't aware of that.
[02:47:36.818 --> 02:47:40.161]  Did anybody else see Anderson Cooper on TV talking about the weather control?
[02:47:41.922 --> 02:47:45.264]  Yeah, I'm looking any day for them to announce Al Qaeda is doing it.
[02:47:45.922 --> 02:47:47.963]  Well, tornadoes destroyed Los Angeles.
[02:47:48.023 --> 02:47:48.743]  It was Al-Qaeda.
[02:47:48.763 --> 02:47:49.923]  We're now in a nuked Syria.
[02:47:50.583 --> 02:47:51.283]  They're behind it.
[02:47:51.343 --> 02:47:52.804]  Mm-hmm.
[02:47:52.844 --> 02:47:55.825]  Let's go ahead and, as you see, you're living in the twilight zone now, folks.
[02:47:55.845 --> 02:47:59.446]  You know, we have Ron Paul on talking about open martial law.
[02:48:00.246 --> 02:48:03.807]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve and KC.
[02:48:03.867 --> 02:48:04.487]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:48:04.967 --> 02:48:06.007]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[02:48:06.308 --> 02:48:06.908]  Good, Bubba.
[02:48:07.668 --> 02:48:08.168]  That's great.
[02:48:09.128 --> 02:48:10.849]  I've had custody of my daughter for 14 years.
[02:48:13.197 --> 02:48:20.823]  Temporary custody is now with her mother, and I've always tried to get on because, uh, you know, you always have Second Amendment people.
[02:48:21.904 --> 02:48:27.068]  And the judge ordered me to, you know, lock up all my guns and ammunition.
[02:48:28.249 --> 02:48:29.229]  Well, just stay there.
[02:48:29.289 --> 02:48:30.370]  I'll have to hear about it after the break.
[02:48:30.390 --> 02:48:37.576]  You're going to probably hear about how free our country is from, uh, Steve, and then we'll talk to Frank, and then we'll get calls.
[02:48:38.404 --> 02:48:39.225]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:39.285 --> 02:48:41.008]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[02:48:41.068 --> 02:48:43.953]  PrisonPlanet.tv and InfoWars.com are the websites.
[02:48:46.064 --> 02:48:47.606]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.786 --> 02:48:50.869]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:51.009 --> 02:48:54.892]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.953 --> 02:48:59.177]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:48:59.537 --> 02:49:03.300]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.401 --> 02:49:05.322]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.442 --> 02:49:08.786]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[02:49:08.806 --> 02:49:09.887]  The medical bills!
[02:49:11.548 --> 02:49:13.509]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.649 --> 02:49:16.711]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:49:16.871 --> 02:49:19.753]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.214 --> 02:49:26.338]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.878 --> 02:49:30.663]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:50:02.418 --> 02:50:06.621]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:06.901 --> 02:50:10.844]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:50:11.064 --> 02:50:17.589]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:50:17.829 --> 02:50:23.313]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[02:51:51.962 --> 02:51:54.066]  Alright, I talked to Steve during the break.
[02:51:54.688 --> 02:51:55.570]  Broke his leg.
[02:51:55.851 --> 02:51:57.314]  Had his daughter for 14 years.
[02:51:57.855 --> 02:51:59.018]  The ex-wife wants her back.
[02:51:59.038 --> 02:52:01.143]  Of course, if you can have custody back when you get a job.
[02:52:02.648 --> 02:52:07.789]  But by the way, we want all your guns locked up in a safe and we're going to come do searches without warrants to check.
[02:52:08.129 --> 02:52:10.750]  And yeah, total violation of the Fourth Amendment, total enslavement.
[02:52:11.190 --> 02:52:13.471]  The government has no business telling us how to run our lives.
[02:52:13.751 --> 02:52:17.672]  They're five times more likely to abuse children than any other group.
[02:52:17.792 --> 02:52:18.712]  And that's their own numbers.
[02:52:18.772 --> 02:52:22.013]  So, again, why is the worst group out there running things?
[02:52:23.313 --> 02:52:24.434]  Again, if the shoe fits, wear it.
[02:52:24.474 --> 02:52:25.754]  Cops say we're all guilty.
[02:52:26.034 --> 02:52:29.055]  Well, if you're statistically more criminal than we are, well then you're all guilty.
[02:52:30.180 --> 02:52:32.787]  Of course, you're obviously not all guilty, so stop treating us like that.
[02:52:33.208 --> 02:52:34.952]  But, I mean, what else is on your mind, sir?
[02:52:35.995 --> 02:52:39.704]  No, I was just wondering if anybody knows of any laws...
[02:52:41.499 --> 02:52:42.099]  That could help me.
[02:52:42.300 --> 02:52:47.743]  Well, it sounds like you've got a law for, uh, that you have to have your guns locked up in your state if you have children.
[02:52:48.344 --> 02:52:50.005]  Those laws have caused a lot of murders.
[02:52:50.085 --> 02:53:01.252]  Famous case of the guy with the pitchfork killing all the kids and the 13-year-old shooting champion couldn't get to her rifle because it was locked up in the safe and, you know, killed all her siblings and she got out of the house.
[02:53:01.292 --> 02:53:02.673]  But I don't know about Missouri.
[02:53:03.634 --> 02:53:05.195]  Are you in the Missouri or the Kansas?
[02:53:05.215 --> 02:53:05.835]  The Kansas side.
[02:53:06.055 --> 02:53:07.056]  You're in the Kansas side?
[02:53:07.870 --> 02:53:11.592]  I'm not, I'm not, you know, totally crazy or anything.
[02:53:11.632 --> 02:53:18.516]  Well, just thank God your daughter's 14 and, you know, pretty soon can live where she wants to, but... It's just protection.
[02:53:18.557 --> 02:53:20.198]  I mean, crime goes on anywhere.
[02:53:20.658 --> 02:53:21.098]  I understand.
[02:53:21.138 --> 02:53:22.119]  Listen, thanks for the call.
[02:53:22.359 --> 02:53:22.579]  Thank you.
[02:53:22.999 --> 02:53:26.361]  I don't know the Kansas laws, but it sounds like more bull.
[02:53:26.982 --> 02:53:29.343]  These family courts just announce themselves gods.
[02:53:29.403 --> 02:53:30.444]  It's like Fish and Wildlife.
[02:53:30.464 --> 02:53:32.985]  They just announce they can come in your house without a warrant.
[02:53:33.025 --> 02:53:34.566]  They just announce they're God.
[02:53:34.806 --> 02:53:37.368]  And folks, just because government says it's God doesn't mean it is.
[02:53:38.363 --> 02:53:39.483]  One last caller quickly.
[02:53:39.583 --> 02:53:40.364]  Frank in New York.
[02:53:40.384 --> 02:53:41.024]  Go ahead, Frank.
[02:53:41.064 --> 02:53:41.744]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:53:41.764 --> 02:53:42.764]  How are you this afternoon?
[02:53:42.824 --> 02:53:43.064]  Good.
[02:53:43.444 --> 02:53:43.645]  Good.
[02:53:44.325 --> 02:53:51.767]  The comment regarding the genetically modified food, it's important to notice that that article is actually from Europe, from the EU.
[02:53:52.587 --> 02:53:58.949]  And for the last 12 years, the Europeans have been very strong against having genetically modified food.
[02:53:58.969 --> 02:54:01.830]  That's because their farmers riot and burn down the government buildings.
[02:54:01.850 --> 02:54:02.350]  That's true.
[02:54:02.510 --> 02:54:03.130]  That's very true.
[02:54:03.450 --> 02:54:06.071]  But what I wanted to say, the reason why we have
[02:54:06.531 --> 02:54:13.655]  The genetically modified food is not only the profitability, but the fact that we tend to put lots of petrochemicals in our soil.
[02:54:13.796 --> 02:54:19.459]  So in Europe, they're very concerned about the amount of chemicals that go into the soil.
[02:54:19.579 --> 02:54:21.000]  So they're very critical.
[02:54:21.020 --> 02:54:21.901]  How about over there?
[02:54:21.941 --> 02:54:22.881]  The food tastes better.
[02:54:23.041 --> 02:54:23.362]  It does.
[02:54:23.462 --> 02:54:24.142]  It actually does.
[02:54:24.162 --> 02:54:24.722]  You're quite right.
[02:54:25.743 --> 02:54:33.748]  But then again, too, it really was the US pressure with the various trading agreements that
[02:54:34.389 --> 02:54:37.111]  got the genetically modified food into Europe.
[02:54:37.712 --> 02:54:44.378]  No, I know, but I mean Europe tried it at first, but literally their farmers from England and France go absolutely berserk.
[02:54:44.758 --> 02:54:46.920]  And let me tell you, that gets the government's attention.
[02:54:46.940 --> 02:54:47.881]  They're actually afraid of us.
[02:54:47.901 --> 02:54:52.765]  I mean, you get 50,000 farmers out burning government buildings, it gets their attention.
[02:54:52.785 --> 02:54:55.868]  Especially in France, where they're very vocal, the farmers.
[02:54:56.448 --> 02:55:01.753]  But regarding the Internet too, Alex, it's actually in operation and they're already starting to
[02:55:02.760 --> 02:55:07.524]  charge university students that are downloading music on the internet too.
[02:55:08.004 --> 02:55:14.509]  So, you know, that probably will occur and I don't think we're going to have really any influence in the policy.
[02:55:14.529 --> 02:55:23.937]  It's got to be the same corporations that dominate the telecommunications industry worldwide that do control the internet.
[02:55:23.957 --> 02:55:26.759]  So, in a sense, the non-governmental groups that
[02:55:28.032 --> 02:55:28.552]  You know what?
[02:55:28.572 --> 02:55:29.273]  We're out of time.
[02:55:29.393 --> 02:55:30.433]  We're out of time.
[02:55:30.613 --> 02:55:33.574]  Sir, if you want to write an article or an email and send it to us, we'll post it.
[02:55:33.594 --> 02:55:35.835]  I want to create a section on the internet, too.
[02:55:38.095 --> 02:55:38.876]  We're out of time.
[02:55:38.916 --> 02:55:41.457]  I'm sorry to all the other callers we didn't get to, Beverly and others.
[02:55:41.537 --> 02:55:44.518]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight, back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:55:44.578 --> 02:55:48.959]  I've only got five, six hours left to broadcast today.
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:53.380]  And I'll be on coast to coast tonight talking about peak oil.
