[00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:06.091]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.772 --> 00:00:07.813]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.534 --> 00:00:09.655]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:11.096]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.877 --> 00:00:12.838]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.438 --> 00:00:17.202]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:21.686]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.354 --> 00:00:26.718]  Hello ladies and gentlemen, the 8th day of September 2005.
[00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:30.583]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:00:30.603 --> 00:00:33.866]  We're going to be live here for the next three hours.
[00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:41.015]  Just a program note before I forget, we've got an outspoken member of parliament,
[00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.811]  George Galloway is going to be in the United States next week giving a couple speeches.
[00:00:46.211 --> 00:01:02.500]  He's going to be on with us tomorrow and early next week we're going to be having Michael Meacher, Member of Parliament, number three from the Blair government, who resigned and blew the whistle on government involvement in 9-11 and much, much more.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.301]  So that is coming up.
[00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:08.043]  Today, it's going to be wide open phones.
[00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:33.933]  I'm working on getting Reporters Without Borders on, because they have been getting a lot of reports, well it's been in our mainstream news, of police beating the living daylights out of even mainstream newspaper reporters, Times Picayune, photographers, I mean they'll knock your teeth out and take your memory stick out of your camera, and then just laugh at you.
[00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:34.853]  It's the new freedom.
[00:01:35.634 --> 00:01:38.435]  FEMA is particularly vicious.
[00:01:39.398 --> 00:01:56.346]  And we are working on a story, going back over the last few years, of all the mainstream news articles, where top FEMA minions running operations in Florida, predominantly, are convicted of hardcore felons, and when it's exposed that they're felons, FEMA goes, we know, these are our men!
[00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:02.629]  Just like Stalin and Hitler emptying out the jails for their stormtroopers.
[00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.770]  They're enforcers, so we'll be exposing that.
[00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.130]  A lot of big developments with FEMA.
[00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.431]  Frustrating and terrorizing and sabotaging.
[00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:18.534]  I mean, we are just catching them every few hours when new incidents of this comes out.
[00:02:19.534 --> 00:02:21.515]  The neocons are in overdrive.
[00:02:22.055 --> 00:02:24.036]  Deception and spin right now.
[00:02:24.316 --> 00:02:25.336]  Very egregious.
[00:02:26.117 --> 00:02:27.617]  Very damaging to this country.
[00:02:27.937 --> 00:02:28.878]  So are the Democrats.
[00:02:29.618 --> 00:02:30.639]  We'll go over that.
[00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.940]  Also, the anniversary of 9-11 is coming up.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.541]  And as we take your calls today,
[00:02:37.668 --> 00:02:45.894]  Now I've gotten better about taking more calls, but I've not really gotten better about cutting people short because we need to just move on to the next caller.
[00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:58.184]  Have your question, have your comment ready, have your point ready, but I want to hear from you because you bring up so many important points that I wouldn't bring up, so many angles we never get to, so many news items that I forget to cover or that I wasn't aware of.
[00:02:59.491 --> 00:03:19.419]  You truly add the key ingredients, the key spices to what we do trying to wake up the American people that are happening upon this broadcast right now from Maryland to Austin, Texas, from Los Angeles, California, to San Diego, to Kansas City, to Pensacola, Florida.
[00:03:20.444 --> 00:03:21.645]  to Chicago, Illinois.
[00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:22.946]  You have the spice.
[00:03:23.527 --> 00:03:25.189]  And the toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.291]  I will go to your calls in the next segment.
[00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:27.371]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:31.795]  But 9-11, the fourth anniversary, four years since that military-industrial complex attack.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:58.679]  If you call in about Katrina or about the martial law we're witnessing or about what's happening to the economy, please at least mention to me what you think one of the number one smoking guns of government involvement and orchestration in 9-11
[00:04:00.106 --> 00:04:27.009]  Please mention one of the smoking guns, one of the things that you think is most important, or you disagree with me and you think some guys in a cave had NORAD stand down and called Willie Brown and told him not to fly, and told Ashcroft not to fly, and did CIA insider trading, and ran drills of the exact same thing happening at the exact same time that morning, and you think the military accidentally flew al-Qaeda out to safety in Afghanistan, and flew the bin Laden's out to safety.
[00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:28.090]  It's all an accident.
[00:04:28.647 --> 00:04:31.289]  And the MI6 mass bomber just so happens to be MI6.
[00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:35.272]  I mean, you can call in if you disagree, too.
[00:04:35.312 --> 00:04:36.613]  I mean, we don't censor, folks.
[00:04:36.653 --> 00:04:45.920]  We just open the phones up, and you're allowed to call in about whatever you want, as long as it's not profane, or there's five people who are banned from this show, five stalkers.
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.281]  You're not allowed.
[00:04:47.301 --> 00:04:48.342]  Of course, you already know that.
[00:04:48.782 --> 00:04:52.485]  Everybody else, we just ask where you're calling from, what your first name is.
[00:04:53.112 --> 00:04:56.593]  We'll be right back to plunge into massive news and information.
[00:04:56.853 --> 00:05:00.394]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.894 --> 00:05:04.795]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:06.796]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:05:06.976 --> 00:05:12.717]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:05:12.998 --> 00:05:18.219]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.703]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:05:22.863 --> 00:05:26.647]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[00:05:26.907 --> 00:05:31.552]  Witnesses populations beg for national ID cards and yes, even implantable microchips.
[00:05:31.632 --> 00:05:34.395]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[00:05:34.715 --> 00:05:37.898]  Psychotic UN population control plans and much, much more.
[00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:39.780]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[00:07:08.101 --> 00:07:13.103]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:07:13.424 --> 00:07:21.328]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:21.488 --> 00:07:28.532]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:28.752 --> 00:07:29.953]  There are no side effects.

[00:07:49.032 --> 00:07:50.053]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:50.113 --> 00:07:51.354]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:51.394 --> 00:07:53.415]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:20.764 --> 00:08:24.707]  Alright, 8 minutes, 15 seconds into this first hour.
[00:08:25.188 --> 00:08:26.449]  Second segment here today.
[00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:29.452]  I want to thank all of our affiliates across the nation.
[00:08:31.614 --> 00:08:33.435]  Blasting out on the AM and FM dial.
[00:08:33.495 --> 00:08:38.180]  Also simulcasting on Global Shortwave on two frequencies of WWCR.
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.943]  11 to 2 Central during the day, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:42.063 --> 00:08:45.827]  And blasting out on multiple digital satellite feeds as well.
[00:08:46.664 --> 00:08:48.446]  And don't ever forget the internet.
[00:08:49.046 --> 00:08:54.250]  We have all the free streams up at InfoWars.com.
[00:08:55.391 --> 00:09:04.498]  And if you ever need to find an alternative stream, if one of those streams is down, you can simply go to GCNLive.com.
[00:09:05.559 --> 00:09:12.565]  Every few months a stream might go down for a few hours, but if you go to GCNLive.com, they'll have backup streams there.
[00:09:14.108 --> 00:09:17.129]  Alright, just so much news to cover.
[00:09:18.289 --> 00:09:23.610]  But I want to open the show up, the broadcast up, with the neocon spin machine.
[00:09:24.971 --> 00:09:32.592]  They'll have the New York Times come out and go, we know that Saddam has yellow cake from Niger and he's going to nuke us.
[00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:38.454]  We know he's got aluminum tubes to build the nuclear missiles and he's going to kill us.
[00:09:39.574 --> 00:09:43.415]  Turns out that lady was on the government payroll, it was all total lies.
[00:09:45.425 --> 00:09:48.826]  Oh, but the New York Times is liberal, the neocons would say.
[00:09:49.227 --> 00:09:51.588]  Well, just like the neocons are a bunch of Trotskyites.
[00:09:52.568 --> 00:09:53.148]  Oh, look!
[00:09:53.188 --> 00:09:55.149]  The New York Times says Saddam's got it.
[00:09:55.309 --> 00:09:55.809]  Oh, look!
[00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:07.494]  Colin Powell's been against the war for the last year and a half, but now on the eve of the Iraq War, he comes forward to the UN, holds up the vial of anthrax, and says, we've got to invade.
[00:10:07.874 --> 00:10:08.515]  They're evil.
[00:10:08.795 --> 00:10:12.236]  Why, look, he was against the war, but now he's been brought over.
[00:10:12.916 --> 00:10:14.317]  That's all theater.
[00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:19.901]  The Republicans and the Democrats work together.
[00:10:21.321 --> 00:10:22.982]  It's a staged event.
[00:10:23.662 --> 00:10:24.923]  There's no difference.
[00:10:25.443 --> 00:10:41.649]  I know that listeners, a lot of you who are smarter than I am, get sick of hearing me, you know, beating on this dead horse, but for so many Americans, they just are blinded by the fact that George Bush is supposedly a Republican fighting the evil Democrats.
[00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.711]  But if you explain to them that the American people are good people,
[00:10:47.418 --> 00:10:59.264]  It's just that the American people are either conned liberals or conned conservatives, and we're in the process of breaking their conditioning, deprogramming them, giving them the true political paradigm.
[00:10:59.844 --> 00:11:06.228]  But if we stay in this stupid left-right mudslinging situation, we're going to lose all our freedoms, folks.
[00:11:07.488 --> 00:11:10.970]  It isn't left or right, it's freedom versus slavery.
[00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.811]  It's tyranny versus liberty.
[00:11:13.691 --> 00:11:13.811]  It's
[00:11:15.422 --> 00:11:17.602]  Having a free country or not having a free country.
[00:11:18.083 --> 00:11:19.483]  That's the real debate here.
[00:11:19.883 --> 00:11:32.046]  And both parties are run by the same private interests that are viciously attacking our liberties, and doing nothing to keep us safe, and dismantling our economy so it can be in the hands of a very small, centralized group.
[00:11:32.286 --> 00:11:33.886]  They're threatened by free market.
[00:11:34.106 --> 00:11:35.126]  They're not free market.
[00:11:37.247 --> 00:11:39.067]  That said, with, you know, the Neocons.
[00:11:39.107 --> 00:11:40.227]  Well, look at the Washington Post.
[00:11:40.267 --> 00:11:41.288]  Well, look at the New York Times.
[00:11:41.328 --> 00:11:42.948]  They say Saddam has got the weapons.
[00:11:44.784 --> 00:11:45.384]  Remember that?
[00:11:46.145 --> 00:11:51.567]  Well, now I hear the neocons on the radio crowing, THE WASHINGTON POST THIS MORNING!
[00:11:52.428 --> 00:11:56.570]  THE WASHINGTON POST THIS MORNING FRONT PAGE!
[00:11:58.331 --> 00:12:07.095]  Why, the liberal newspaper, even they've got to admit, Bush increased the funding for the levees and the dikes.
[00:12:08.929 --> 00:12:11.791]  And the liberals have lied about it!
[00:12:11.871 --> 00:12:14.673]  And then I read the article, and it's all lies!
[00:12:15.534 --> 00:12:19.877]  I mean, a five-year-old who had the facts to decipher the lies in this article!
[00:12:20.157 --> 00:12:29.263]  I would take an hour right now to go over this article and to decipher it, but I mean, just... Bottom line, we've gone to the Congressional Budget Office's own reports.
[00:12:29.543 --> 00:12:36.208]  There were articles two years ago, year and a half ago, a year ago, six months ago, a month ago, two and a half weeks ago!
[00:12:37.719 --> 00:12:45.604]  Bill Clinton slashed the funding massively in 1999 and 2000.
[00:12:46.005 --> 00:12:47.886]  George Bush cut it even more.
[00:12:49.067 --> 00:12:58.153]  Now, the only thing that the Washington Post has is New Orleans and Louisiana gets the most anti-flooding funding.
[00:12:58.933 --> 00:12:59.874]  Well, that's true.
[00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:01.795]  So that's their statistic.
[00:13:02.296 --> 00:13:04.097]  They say, look, they get more.
[00:13:04.177 --> 00:13:04.877]  He increased it.
[00:13:04.897 --> 00:13:05.838]  Look, they get the most.
[00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:07.851]  Well, of course they get the most.
[00:13:08.632 --> 00:13:10.293]  Much of the state is below sea level.
[00:13:11.734 --> 00:13:15.217]  But just because they're getting the most doesn't mean it hasn't massively been cut.
[00:13:16.898 --> 00:13:19.700]  Specifically, the levees that had problems.
[00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:29.108]  So, look, I'm not going to belabor this all day, but I'm already getting emails from idiots going, Alex, you've been proven wrong!
[00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.071]  Even the liberals at the Washington Post.
[00:13:33.932 --> 00:13:36.974]  Even though I met George W. and Chris Fundon.
[00:13:39.235 --> 00:13:45.097]  Look, if you like being conned, and you like being manipulated, and you like being played like a fool, then I can't help you.
[00:13:45.137 --> 00:13:48.139]  I mean, it's so sad to see you getting conned.
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:51.981]  You know, I get mad at people trying to con me.
[00:13:52.001 --> 00:13:58.844]  You know, they got this scam all over the country where a van pulls up when you're in a parking lot and goes, goes, sir, sir!
[00:13:59.622 --> 00:14:00.383]  It's a clearance.
[00:14:00.583 --> 00:14:02.844]  We had a guy who was going to take these on order.
[00:14:03.244 --> 00:14:04.045]  He didn't want them.
[00:14:04.425 --> 00:14:05.585]  These speakers are normally $1,000.
[00:14:06.526 --> 00:14:06.906]  They're only $200.
[00:14:09.948 --> 00:14:13.310]  Well, those speakers, folks, are total pieces of junk, and they're worth about $25.
[00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:19.533]  And I'll watch people in parking lots being conned buying them, and I'll walk over and I'll go, Don't!
[00:14:19.653 --> 00:14:20.313]  It's a scam!
[00:14:20.554 --> 00:14:21.174]  It's a scam!
[00:14:23.672 --> 00:14:32.577]  And I've had people start, this has happened twice, I've had these big ol' burly con artists almost get in fights with me, and I'll end up howling in the parking lot, and normally I have total control, folks.
[00:14:32.837 --> 00:14:34.038]  Come on, let's do it!
[00:14:35.018 --> 00:14:36.899]  I mean, I just don't like scammers.
[00:14:37.059 --> 00:14:38.580]  I just can't stand them.
[00:14:40.041 --> 00:14:51.547]  But I mean, I don't know, the last time I almost got in a fight with a guy, it was probably eight years ago, it seems like yesterday, I probably have more control today, but somebody can flip me off in traffic, they can cut me off, I don't even, my pulse doesn't even quicken.
[00:14:52.422 --> 00:14:55.403]  But when I see a scam going on, man, I just lose control.
[00:14:56.663 --> 00:15:07.086]  And I just see you getting conned, and you look at me giggling with your dim eyes, you know, when you're giggling at me going, huh, good luck, Bush, and you're so willfully stupid.
[00:15:07.646 --> 00:15:09.067]  I mean, you're not dumb deep down.
[00:15:09.107 --> 00:15:11.887]  It takes, it takes like a mind trick.
[00:15:11.927 --> 00:15:19.429]  You play on yourself, you know, a double think to, uh, man, well, Jesus Christ said it.
[00:15:19.489 --> 00:15:21.330]  I mean, none are so blind as
[00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:24.017]  Those that have eyes and cannot see.
[00:15:27.478 --> 00:15:31.259]  And I just don't know how you love it.
[00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:35.400]  You know, I see families who obviously don't have a lot of money.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.741]  Lower middle class or working class.
[00:15:38.661 --> 00:15:46.743]  And the kids are totally into materialism and they're sitting there, you know, getting their pure sugar drinks at the cash register.
[00:15:46.763 --> 00:15:48.444]  They've got black circles around their eyes.
[00:15:48.864 --> 00:15:51.885]  The father's sitting there dumping thirty bucks on lottery tickets.
[00:15:52.921 --> 00:15:55.583]  You see him while I was pumping gas last night.
[00:15:55.904 --> 00:15:58.206]  You see him sitting there while his kids run around the parking lot.
[00:15:58.246 --> 00:15:59.727]  He's just real hopeful.
[00:16:00.067 --> 00:16:01.588]  He's just looking at those lottery tickets.
[00:16:01.609 --> 00:16:03.410]  Look at those numbers he picked.
[00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:05.832]  Just hoping, hoping, hoping, hoping.
[00:16:06.092 --> 00:16:08.254]  Buddy, you've got a better chance of getting struck by lightning twice.
[00:16:08.494 --> 00:16:09.675]  Plus, the lotteries are staged.
[00:16:09.715 --> 00:16:10.316]  We've proven that.
[00:16:10.336 --> 00:16:11.657]  I could do a whole show on that.
[00:16:11.697 --> 00:16:19.544]  But the point is, if you invested that money in a 2% guaranteed return, the amount of money you spend, you'd have millions of dollars when you retire.
[00:16:22.074 --> 00:16:25.437]  I mean, since I was about 25, I've been sticking a little bit of money each month in the bank.
[00:16:25.757 --> 00:16:28.120]  Not much, but it's built up to something substantive.
[00:16:31.563 --> 00:16:37.728]  And I just... And I want to talk about total criminality by FEMA, total sabotaging, on purpose, folks.
[00:16:37.789 --> 00:16:44.475]  I've got all this new news, all this incredible stuff to talk about, and I just... I just get sad.
[00:16:44.535 --> 00:16:45.135]  I get angry.
[00:16:45.175 --> 00:16:45.736]  I get mad.
[00:16:46.474 --> 00:16:58.747]  And I get mad at con artists out there, government operatives and disinformation specialists that I'm trying to undermine the Freedom Movement, the Truth Movement, the Patriot Movement, the Truth Seeking Movement, whatever you want to call it.
[00:16:59.708 --> 00:17:02.631]  People say, well you need to respond to this latest attack against you.
[00:17:03.032 --> 00:17:06.015]  How do I respond to things that are totally baseless and false?
[00:17:09.352 --> 00:17:13.336]  And the latest thing is that I supposedly say there weren't bombs in Building 7.
[00:17:13.996 --> 00:17:14.857]  I've never said that.
[00:17:14.897 --> 00:17:16.158]  I've always said it was the government.
[00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:17.440]  There were clearly bombs in there.
[00:17:17.460 --> 00:17:18.040]  It doesn't matter.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.122]  This info people say I say there weren't bombs.
[00:17:20.703 --> 00:17:22.124]  Well, Alex, you need to answer for this.
[00:17:22.164 --> 00:17:22.965]  Well, I didn't say it.
[00:17:23.225 --> 00:17:23.906]  So shut up!
[00:17:24.946 --> 00:17:30.291]  The newest thing is that I'm saying Arabs carried out 9-11.
[00:17:30.371 --> 00:17:33.094]  I've never said that.
[00:17:33.234 --> 00:17:33.494]  Never.
[00:17:33.775 --> 00:17:34.095]  Anywhere.
[00:17:34.713 --> 00:17:38.635]  But again, I can't respond to pure... Well, Alex, you need to respond!
[00:17:38.675 --> 00:17:39.335]  You're a Fed!
[00:17:39.535 --> 00:17:40.916]  Well, there's no responding to it!
[00:17:40.936 --> 00:17:41.796]  And let me tell you something.
[00:17:42.097 --> 00:17:44.518]  You're about to lose everything you've got, America.
[00:17:45.178 --> 00:17:49.500]  And you better get your head screwed on straight, and get focused in on serious issues.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:56.684]  And not the jealous, envious, hateful people that run other so-called patriot networks, and the people that are scamming you.
[00:17:57.444 --> 00:18:01.606]  And you need to get focused on fighting the globalists, and fighting the New World Order.
[00:18:02.657 --> 00:18:06.560]  Instead of your lore and your gossip and your garbage.
[00:18:07.821 --> 00:18:13.165]  Let's take some calls and then when we get back I'll just plunge right into the news.
[00:18:13.185 --> 00:18:14.826]  But let's just go to calls right now.
[00:18:15.186 --> 00:18:18.368]  Charles has been calling in every day giving us reports from Louisiana.
[00:18:18.729 --> 00:18:20.310]  Charles give us your report my friend.
[00:18:20.430 --> 00:18:20.670]  Yes sir.
[00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:27.675]  Well first I'd like to say the first sign of the Twin Towers was the executive order SW199I.
[00:18:30.856 --> 00:18:33.437]  That's what I think was the first smoking gun for me.
[00:18:34.397 --> 00:18:42.600]  And that's Bush with W1999 ordering, ordering of the FBI and Defense Intelligence and CIA to stand down and not stop Al Qaeda.
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:42.960]  Yes, sir.
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:50.562]  Oh, Mr. Jones, I want to report to you Fox News, they're bringing foreign troops in from San Antonio.
[00:18:52.054 --> 00:18:54.115]  I think it's 43 truckloads.
[00:18:54.135 --> 00:18:55.695]  Yeah, they're bringing in Mexican troops.
[00:18:56.095 --> 00:19:00.396]  And a ship in New Orleans of Mexican troops.
[00:19:00.576 --> 00:19:02.257]  And that's absolutely horrible.
[00:19:02.817 --> 00:19:07.458]  It is the first time in hundreds of years that this has happened.
[00:19:07.918 --> 00:19:10.379]  And again, we said no foreign troops.
[00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:12.699]  So, don't take the French water filters.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.720]  Don't take the Dutch food.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:16.440]  Don't take the British food.
[00:19:16.761 --> 00:19:18.281]  Let's have some foreign troops!
[00:19:18.976 --> 00:19:19.836]  Well, okay.
[00:19:20.196 --> 00:19:21.997]  Now, this is the line of the stadium for me.
[00:19:22.357 --> 00:19:26.277]  I'm not going to have somebody come to my house with a gun and can't speak English.
[00:19:26.737 --> 00:19:29.658]  If we don't stand up to this now, it's all over.
[00:19:30.258 --> 00:19:31.178]  Well, you know what?
[00:19:32.018 --> 00:19:34.139]  Instant message, my folks.
[00:19:34.979 --> 00:19:36.599]  My folks at the office.
[00:19:36.659 --> 00:19:37.920]  I forgot to put a tape in.
[00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.160]  Tape the news, because I have the AP report about the thousands of Mexican troops coming.
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:45.021]  But I need video of that.
[00:19:46.511 --> 00:19:50.255]  Charles, just a month ago I talked about that dream I keep having about the Mexican troops.
[00:19:50.335 --> 00:19:51.397]  Yes, sir, you sure did.
[00:19:51.437 --> 00:19:51.937]  I remember.
[00:19:52.478 --> 00:19:53.319]  I tell you what, stay there.
[00:19:53.899 --> 00:19:55.381]  But this is all just a dry run.
[00:19:55.421 --> 00:19:59.065]  Well, I mean, the military's already 20-something percent foreign troops, so, you know.
[00:19:59.165 --> 00:19:59.726]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:02.345 --> 00:20:04.847]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[00:20:05.408 --> 00:20:10.712]  Did you know that the United Nations has always chosen socialist one-worlders for its leadership?
[00:20:11.392 --> 00:20:17.557]  Did you know that the United Nations seeks power to control the environment, population, children, and the whole world?
[00:20:18.218 --> 00:20:21.060]  They want to dissolve our Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:32.887]  We would like to help you understand why these things are happening and how they fulfill Bible prophecy by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.802]  Operators are standing by to receive your call.
[00:21:01.485 --> 00:21:04.747]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:21:04.807 --> 00:21:08.969]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:21:09.229 --> 00:21:12.031]  But, if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:21:12.211 --> 00:21:14.612]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:21:14.812 --> 00:21:23.437]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:21:23.637 --> 00:21:24.998]  The Brookie light is different.
[00:21:25.178 --> 00:21:29.360]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.120]  We're good to go!
[00:21:48.669 --> 00:21:51.433]  Get the Advanced Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:51.453 --> 00:21:52.335]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:03.027 --> 00:22:04.088]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:04.469 --> 00:22:09.955]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:10.536 --> 00:22:11.036]  That's right.
[00:22:11.357 --> 00:22:13.639]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:21.128]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:21.684 --> 00:22:29.369]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds, and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:29.809 --> 00:22:34.672]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:35.293 --> 00:22:38.314]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:41.096 --> 00:22:45.241]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.
[00:22:45.621 --> 00:22:45.881]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.901 --> 00:22:47.803]  Make sure that you secure your future.
[00:22:47.884 --> 00:22:48.184]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.204 --> 00:22:48.764]  That's 1-800-686-2237.

[00:24:02.357 --> 00:24:07.498]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:08.179 --> 00:24:10.499]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:10.519 --> 00:24:16.681]  You know, this isn't really the first time Mexican troops have been here in modern history.
[00:24:17.542 --> 00:24:25.585]  Mexican, Canadian, and then some other European troops back in 99, when it was admitted that the U.S.
[00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:26.725]  Meteorological Survey
[00:24:28.409 --> 00:24:30.791]  Don't do controlled burns out west this year.
[00:24:31.292 --> 00:24:32.693]  Hot winds out of Mexico.
[00:24:32.773 --> 00:24:33.654]  Incredible drought.
[00:24:34.134 --> 00:24:35.475]  It will cause massive fires.
[00:24:35.515 --> 00:24:39.018]  They haven't let them in decades cut fire breaks along the roads.
[00:24:40.339 --> 00:24:45.744]  And the Feds, again, just like with this hurricane, they created the crisis.
[00:24:46.484 --> 00:24:48.146]  Just like with this hurricane, not responding.
[00:24:48.646 --> 00:24:52.229]  Well, in the case of 99, they set the fires in 11 states.
[00:24:52.630 --> 00:24:54.431]  12 major fires in 11 states.
[00:24:54.471 --> 00:24:55.272]  And it was in the news.
[00:24:55.312 --> 00:24:56.433]  The Feds set the fire.
[00:24:57.429 --> 00:25:04.231]  And wouldn't let, um, helicopters get water to go dump water to save firefighters and a bunch of them died.
[00:25:04.631 --> 00:25:05.652]  Remember that up in Oregon?
[00:25:05.672 --> 00:25:08.132]  That was just one of many cases.
[00:25:09.053 --> 00:25:16.715]  And the good news is, in New Mexico and Arizona and other areas, the counties declared their own emergencies and forcibly had the sheriffs kick the feds out.
[00:25:17.175 --> 00:25:20.956]  You know, I even interviewed sheriffs here on air, so that happened then.
[00:25:22.277 --> 00:25:26.538]  The feds set the fires, even though the other federal branch said don't do it.
[00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:30.933]  Then fires burned for, what, four or five months, and they brought in Mexican troops.
[00:25:30.973 --> 00:25:34.054]  But see, here's the headline out of Reuters.
[00:25:35.455 --> 00:25:36.595]  Actually, I read the wrong article.
[00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:38.296]  This is the headline out of the Associated Press.
[00:25:38.756 --> 00:25:42.898]  Mexican military enters Texas for the first time since 1846.
[00:25:44.258 --> 00:25:52.121]  Mexican Army convoys and a Navy ship laden with food supplies and specialists travel to the United States Wednesday to help in Hurricane Katrina relief.
[00:25:52.739 --> 00:25:54.060]  Folks, I can't watch it all.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.342]  I need you to videotape I-35 when they come up.
[00:25:56.782 --> 00:25:58.283]  I need local news to be taped.
[00:25:58.404 --> 00:26:00.645]  I've got people working on it right now, but I can't do it all.
[00:26:01.006 --> 00:26:02.227]  Help me get video of this.
[00:26:02.827 --> 00:26:08.892]  It was a highly symbolic journey, making the first time Mexico's military has aided its northern neighbor.
[00:26:09.172 --> 00:26:09.652]  Not true.
[00:26:10.073 --> 00:26:15.577]  By the way, isn't it funny that just a year ago they signed the North American military agreement with Canada and Mexico.
[00:26:15.637 --> 00:26:19.100]  Canada pulled its hair out saying it would give up some of its sovereignty doing this, but
[00:26:19.890 --> 00:26:21.851]  And then, yeah, so now we're going to have foreign troops here.
[00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:26.934]  A convoy of 45 vehicles arrived at the border city of Nuevo Laredo.
[00:26:27.354 --> 00:26:28.475]  Oh, the same place where the U.S.
[00:26:28.535 --> 00:26:30.876]  Embassy shut down because of the 600 murders.
[00:26:32.037 --> 00:26:33.218]  It was to cross the U.S.
[00:26:33.238 --> 00:26:34.598]  territory early today.
[00:26:35.459 --> 00:26:36.259]  That's Thursday.
[00:26:36.379 --> 00:26:41.742]  General Francisco Ortez Valadez told reporters as his men refueled at a local gas station.
[00:26:42.183 --> 00:26:47.846]  He said the troops would help the evacuee operations in San Antonio.
[00:26:48.763 --> 00:26:57.848]  So I can go down, I guess I'll just go down to San Antonio and show where the Mexican troops are going to be bivouac, bringing in the people from New Orleans.
[00:26:57.928 --> 00:26:59.609]  So I can just go, I'll go do a report.
[00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.030]  No rest ever, folks.
[00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:05.892]  I don't get to see my family much, but there goes a day or so this weekend.
[00:27:05.912 --> 00:27:12.376]  I was going to try to spend half the weekend video editing on a new film and the other half with my family, but it looks like
[00:27:13.846 --> 00:27:15.287]  No family time, but that's okay.
[00:27:15.567 --> 00:27:16.828]  I'm going to go down to San Antonio.
[00:27:17.228 --> 00:27:21.712]  Our mission is to give aid to the civilian population affected by the disaster, Fortez said.
[00:27:22.112 --> 00:27:28.276]  Federal police briefly blocked the highway in both directions as the convoy arrived in the gasoline station.
[00:27:29.177 --> 00:27:34.781]  Radio talk shows and newspapers in Mexico buzzed with excitement over news that the country, long on the receiving end of U.S.
[00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:38.043]  disaster relief, was sending a hurricane aid convoy north.
[00:27:39.611 --> 00:27:45.752]  The condo represents the first Mexican military unit, as somebody call the AP up and correct them, to operate on U.S.
[00:27:45.792 --> 00:27:54.294]  soil since 1846 when Mexican troops briefly marched into Texas, which was separated from Mexico and joined the United States.
[00:27:54.794 --> 00:27:57.595]  Yeah, you briefly marched in when you got your tails kicked out of here.
[00:27:58.115 --> 00:28:05.817]  The effort includes military specialists, doctors, nurses, and engineers carrying water treatment plants, mobile kitchens, food, and blankets.
[00:28:06.617 --> 00:28:06.817]  Uh-huh.
[00:28:07.518 --> 00:28:13.524]  Isn't it funny though that they wouldn't, and we appreciate this for Mexico, but the point is, this is part of a larger design.
[00:28:14.445 --> 00:28:14.785]  Okay?
[00:28:15.206 --> 00:28:28.779]  I'm sure these are well-meaning troops, well-meaning people, well-meaning Mexican citizens helping us, we appreciate it, but why wouldn't they take the French water, which was non-military, why wouldn't they take the French engineers a week and a half ago?
[00:28:29.457 --> 00:28:34.021]  Because it's got to be Mexican troops, folks, because they're going to police America.
[00:28:34.321 --> 00:28:35.362]  This is in the agreement.
[00:28:35.422 --> 00:28:38.845]  It said for natural disasters and to fight terror.
[00:28:40.386 --> 00:28:41.647]  In fact, that's in one of my films.
[00:28:41.667 --> 00:28:42.808]  Which one of the films is that in?
[00:28:43.549 --> 00:28:44.750]  Actually, show the news articles.
[00:28:46.431 --> 00:28:47.072]  Road to Tyranny.
[00:28:47.212 --> 00:28:47.732]  Road to Tyranny.
[00:28:47.752 --> 00:28:48.533]  Alright, I'm going to shut up.
[00:28:49.554 --> 00:28:49.814]  It's just...
[00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:53.392]  See, this is one of the many articles hidden in plain view that I was going to cover.
[00:28:53.412 --> 00:28:54.573]  It was number three in the stack.
[00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:57.855]  But I've gotten off babbling about other stuff I haven't even talked about.
[00:28:58.356 --> 00:28:59.957]  See, we're all being desensitized.
[00:29:01.798 --> 00:29:03.219]  And again, you always hear this, folks.
[00:29:03.299 --> 00:29:05.641]  I guarantee you, when I go down there, they're going to be running perimeter.
[00:29:05.981 --> 00:29:07.242]  They're going to have guns.
[00:29:07.282 --> 00:29:07.742]  You watch.
[00:29:08.303 --> 00:29:08.663]  You watch.
[00:29:08.703 --> 00:29:09.183]  I'm going down.
[00:29:09.964 --> 00:29:10.825]  Charles, go ahead.
[00:29:11.225 --> 00:29:14.027]  And now let me tell you what they're doing to people that don't want to leave.
[00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:23.246]  Not the Louisiana Army, but the other armies are saying, they're putting guns on us, saying, give me your dope and your guns and get in the boat.
[00:29:23.747 --> 00:29:25.388]  A lot of these people ain't dope fiends.
[00:29:25.809 --> 00:29:27.991]  They just, you know, they just fan the people.
[00:29:28.471 --> 00:29:32.035]  They told one woman up here, you must be horny by now.
[00:29:32.055 --> 00:29:34.116]  I mean, what kind of military is that?
[00:29:35.358 --> 00:29:36.639]  What kind of military is that?
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:38.921]  Well, it's admitted.
[00:29:38.941 --> 00:29:41.003]  Reporters with, um,
[00:29:43.038 --> 00:29:46.041]  Inside the city said famous solicits women for rescue.
[00:29:46.221 --> 00:29:46.381]  Yeah.
[00:29:46.541 --> 00:29:50.004]  I'll let you finish up real quick Charles and we'll go to others when we get back since I've been cutting you short.
[00:29:51.586 --> 00:29:52.527]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.967 --> 00:29:54.588]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.489 --> 00:29:58.172]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.895 --> 00:30:04.938]  Gano Café is the new energy drink that's sweeping the globe.
[00:30:05.178 --> 00:30:06.959]  Already a number one beverage in Asia.
[00:30:07.159 --> 00:30:10.802]  Gano Café is the new energy drink for coffee, tea, and cocoa lovers.
[00:30:11.102 --> 00:30:16.967]  What makes Gano Café special is the secret ingredient Reishi, a concentration of six species of red mushroom.
[00:30:17.107 --> 00:30:19.029]  Also known as the miraculous king of herbs.
[00:30:19.209 --> 00:30:23.012]  Known for its high nutritional value, Reishi packs a bigger punch than ginseng.
[00:30:23.372 --> 00:30:27.073]  One packet of Gano Café is the energy equivalent of a whole pot of coffee.

[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:05.403]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[00:31:05.443 --> 00:31:05.963]  are located?
[00:31:06.143 --> 00:31:09.545]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[00:31:39.633 --> 00:31:39.973]  I think so.
[00:32:01.252 --> 00:32:04.634]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:32:04.874 --> 00:32:05.214]  Why?
[00:32:05.554 --> 00:32:08.176]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[00:33:05.199 --> 00:33:10.722]  This is all part of a desensitization process.
[00:33:11.522 --> 00:33:22.247]  In the late 80s, Marines in police uniforms kicked down doors of gun dealers, raiding them in Norfolk, Virginia and other areas as part of secret programs.
[00:33:23.968 --> 00:33:27.249]  But see, just now they announce that the Marines are engaging in law enforcement.
[00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:36.044]  We've had Mexican troops here many times as part of covert operations with our government, part of the Pan American Union, Union of American States.
[00:33:38.245 --> 00:33:42.667]  But see, just now the Associated Press says, oh, this is the first time.
[00:33:42.687 --> 00:33:56.214]  When you read into the article, there's actually convoys going to Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and the Army won't say exactly where all, but just, you'll be seeing the foreign troops, but
[00:33:56.943 --> 00:33:59.784]  It says, all the convoy's participants will be unarmed.
[00:34:00.344 --> 00:34:06.685]  In July of 2004, Mexican troops interrupted the funeral of a Mexican-born Marine killed in Iraq.
[00:34:08.106 --> 00:34:08.646]  Well, yeah.
[00:34:09.146 --> 00:34:10.606]  Soon that'll be the majority of the Marines.
[00:34:11.067 --> 00:34:12.587]  Gotta have your foreign troops one way or the other.
[00:34:12.867 --> 00:34:15.908]  They objected to the non-working ceremonial rifles.
[00:34:16.288 --> 00:34:17.308]  Yeah, plugged rifles.
[00:34:18.148 --> 00:34:21.429]  Carried by two Marines who came from the United States for the ceremony.
[00:34:21.809 --> 00:34:24.550]  So imagine, Marines go down there with little wooden rifles.
[00:34:25.413 --> 00:34:28.494]  They go to Mexico to honor a Mexican who died in the Marine Corps.
[00:34:29.675 --> 00:34:32.216]  24% of the ground in the army in Iraq, folks.
[00:34:32.236 --> 00:34:33.937]  It's very dangerous to have a foreign army.
[00:34:34.057 --> 00:34:34.897]  But who cares?
[00:34:34.937 --> 00:34:38.439]  Let's just ignore it.
[00:34:38.599 --> 00:34:40.980]  It's just amazing.
[00:34:41.921 --> 00:34:43.101]  It's absolutely amazing.
[00:34:46.863 --> 00:34:54.027]  They shut down the troops, and said because it's so threatening that you've got toy guns.
[00:34:54.087 --> 00:34:55.408]  We don't let foreign troops here.
[00:34:55.748 --> 00:34:56.409]  Get out of here.
[00:34:56.649 --> 00:34:57.369]  It's in the article.
[00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:02.032]  Because I guess Mexico in some respects has got its head screwed on straight.
[00:35:03.252 --> 00:35:07.115]  Look, believe me folks, we don't need food to be delivered to the victims now.
[00:35:07.635 --> 00:35:11.137]  We don't need food to be delivered in Houston or Dallas or San Antonio.
[00:35:11.697 --> 00:35:16.320]  I drove by the convention center in downtown Austin last night, and folks let me tell you something.
[00:35:17.443 --> 00:35:39.072]  There were 15 foot pallets of food, 10 foot pallets of brand new blue jeans that I guess Levi's has given, giant bags and containers, people digging through goods, people just laden with goods, people handing them wads of cash, hippies everywhere hugging and begging, and the folks from the 9th Ward, I even got out
[00:35:39.642 --> 00:35:41.763]  For a few minutes, we're just totally paranoid.
[00:35:41.803 --> 00:35:42.704]  What do you want from me?
[00:35:42.764 --> 00:35:44.184]  Why are you helping me so much?
[00:35:44.705 --> 00:35:46.445]  Because people have never been that nice to them.
[00:35:46.626 --> 00:35:51.408]  They're freaking out on the melding of hippiness and Texas hospitality.
[00:35:51.448 --> 00:35:52.408]  Well, we're staying here.
[00:35:52.428 --> 00:35:54.910]  That's what they're saying.
[00:35:55.030 --> 00:35:56.330]  It's on the news.
[00:35:56.691 --> 00:35:57.551]  We're staying here.
[00:35:58.211 --> 00:36:06.956]  Well, just, we'll be nice to you, but don't, some of you are being a little bit rude and out of control, so don't push your luck, some of you, with Texas hospitality.
[00:36:07.316 --> 00:36:08.216]  It only goes so far.
[00:36:10.191 --> 00:36:13.773]  Yeah, I was downtown last night and 35 was shut down with traffic.
[00:36:15.054 --> 00:36:22.499]  So I went over to IHOP and ate an omelet with some friends and then they left and I decided I'd drop by the convention center that was about 100 yards away.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:32.146]  And I just parked and walked over there and let me tell you, I only spent about five minutes and it was not a pretty sight.
[00:36:32.166 --> 00:36:38.210]  You got the riot police out there and you've got just goods piled up to the ceiling.
[00:36:39.083 --> 00:36:46.690]  But the people weren't prisoners there, and they shouldn't be prisoners, but I'll tell you, in Houston they are prisoners, basically.
[00:36:46.710 --> 00:36:58.680]  They're allowed out like an hour a day, and they're basically... the police stay right up on top of them, and they search them, and... I don't know what to say anymore, it's just... it's just crazy.
[00:36:59.361 --> 00:37:00.662]  But it's right here in the article,
[00:37:02.276 --> 00:37:09.442]  Mexico later apologized, but said it had an obligation to enforce a ban on foreign troops carrying weapons in its territory.
[00:37:10.723 --> 00:37:11.363]  And it goes on.
[00:37:12.044 --> 00:37:14.186]  So this is all just training us.
[00:37:14.246 --> 00:37:15.827]  Oh, the Mexican troops are here again!
[00:37:16.327 --> 00:37:17.408]  They're here to save us!
[00:37:18.569 --> 00:37:21.632]  Well, they were here before, a few years ago, when we had the hurricane.
[00:37:22.412 --> 00:37:26.335]  Now our great leader has called them in to quote, deal with terrorists.
[00:37:26.736 --> 00:37:31.700]  Folks, I have NORTHCOM press releases saying, Mexican troops have trained with the army,
[00:37:32.441 --> 00:37:34.061]  They've been here a whole bunch of times.
[00:37:34.882 --> 00:37:36.162]  They've been out at Fort Hood.
[00:37:36.382 --> 00:37:37.422]  They're out there right now.
[00:37:37.963 --> 00:37:38.783]  This is not the first.
[00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:41.423]  And they are training to take your guns.
[00:37:41.543 --> 00:37:42.284]  Do you understand?
[00:37:42.864 --> 00:37:45.525]  I have urban warfare training drills on video.
[00:37:45.825 --> 00:37:47.005]  We have Cooperative Nugget 95, 96, 97.
[00:37:49.246 --> 00:37:50.706]  We have clips of that in my videos.
[00:37:51.246 --> 00:37:52.646]  At Fort Polk, Louisiana.
[00:37:52.686 --> 00:37:53.387]  Speak of the devil.
[00:37:53.467 --> 00:37:54.507]  Fort Polk, Louisiana.
[00:37:54.967 --> 00:37:56.327]  And it's Mexican troops.
[00:37:56.468 --> 00:37:58.028]  It's Czech Republic troops.
[00:37:59.215 --> 00:38:05.177]  It's other slob troops, and they're training to take your guns, folks, and admitting it's for America!
[00:38:05.197 --> 00:38:07.637]  You know, you've got the little school.
[00:38:07.677 --> 00:38:08.457]  It says school.
[00:38:08.998 --> 00:38:10.518]  Got the American flag flying on it.
[00:38:11.518 --> 00:38:13.739]  Because they know foreign troops will do what it takes.
[00:38:13.779 --> 00:38:24.781]  This isn't... Folks, the British landed in two separate wars in 1812, and of course in 1776, throughout that eight-year war, German troops.
[00:38:25.562 --> 00:38:26.982]  Half their force was German.
[00:38:29.289 --> 00:38:30.190]  You understand that?
[00:38:30.271 --> 00:38:36.359]  And they were the most vicious, because if you don't speak the same language, you're a different culture, you have a tendency to do brittle things.
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.363]  We finally started slaughtering them at Trenton and other areas.
[00:38:40.144 --> 00:38:43.910]  It was actually the foreign troops, though, that turned the tide, even more than the British raping and rioting.
[00:38:45.684 --> 00:38:50.206]  It was the Hessians raping and bayonetting and being so vicious.
[00:38:50.786 --> 00:38:55.868]  It was the foreign troops that finally turned the tide and got a bunch of fence-sitters off the fence.
[00:38:56.128 --> 00:38:57.689]  So I say bring your Mexican troops.
[00:38:58.209 --> 00:39:01.970]  Bring them into Fredericksburg, Texas, where I've seen them in my mind's eye.
[00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:03.351]  Bring them into Llano.
[00:39:03.551 --> 00:39:04.611]  Bring them into Austin.
[00:39:05.091 --> 00:39:05.612]  Bring them.
[00:39:06.032 --> 00:39:07.992]  Let it come, as Patrick Henry said.
[00:39:08.332 --> 00:39:08.833]  Bring them!
[00:39:09.593 --> 00:39:10.953]  Come on, let's get it on!
[00:39:11.394 --> 00:39:12.394]  I'm tired of talking!
[00:39:13.641 --> 00:39:15.381]  And don't worry, folks, you're not going to have to wait.
[00:39:15.901 --> 00:39:21.103]  If we don't turn this around now, you're going to see it in the next few years, I predict, after the globalists detonate thermal nuclear weapons.
[00:39:22.223 --> 00:39:24.043]  And you want to know when the shoe drops?
[00:39:24.483 --> 00:39:32.945]  It's when you've got armed Mexican troops and Latin American troops, death squads, trained at Fort Benning, Georgia, and Fort Hood, running around this country.
[00:39:32.965 --> 00:39:37.886]  Alright, I'm about... It's just... It's out of control, folks.
[00:39:38.966 --> 00:39:39.806]  It's out of control.
[00:39:41.187 --> 00:39:43.187]  And the feds can team up with Mexico all day.
[00:39:46.052 --> 00:39:46.832]  They're going to lose.
[00:39:48.333 --> 00:39:49.734]  We've got God on our side.
[00:39:50.454 --> 00:39:51.155]  We're stronger.
[00:39:52.135 --> 00:39:55.857]  We've got the defense of our families and our futures at stake.
[00:39:56.117 --> 00:39:56.898]  We're going to win.
[00:39:57.138 --> 00:39:58.178]  They're not motivated.
[00:39:58.399 --> 00:39:59.219]  We're motivated.
[00:39:59.779 --> 00:40:03.982]  Everything I've done has been in preparation for what you're now seeing to start to unfold.
[00:40:05.963 --> 00:40:08.324]  Everything I've done is to wake people up to the threat.
[00:40:08.364 --> 00:40:10.785]  I think we've done a good job, but we're getting over.
[00:40:11.185 --> 00:40:12.346]  Alright, I said I'd take a bunch of calls.
[00:40:12.406 --> 00:40:13.927]  It's just so much to say, folks.
[00:40:15.057 --> 00:40:17.199]  Charles, finish up what you were talking about.
[00:40:17.219 --> 00:40:17.840]  I'm not going to take it.
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:25.008]  Don't be troop-proof saying I've got a bunch of news articles where, yeah, and we're even getting reports that are having their way with a few of the women, but go ahead.
[00:40:25.288 --> 00:40:27.090]  Yes, but I'm not taking the foreign troops.
[00:40:27.150 --> 00:40:29.152]  If they handle my wife, I'm dying here.
[00:40:29.473 --> 00:40:30.394]  I've had enough of this.
[00:40:30.914 --> 00:40:32.275]  And I'm going to tell you the truth.
[00:40:32.295 --> 00:40:33.475]  You've preached for years.
[00:40:33.755 --> 00:40:35.476]  It's time for the people to wake up now.
[00:40:35.796 --> 00:40:37.296]  You did everything in your power.
[00:40:37.536 --> 00:40:38.997]  I did everything in my power.
[00:40:39.257 --> 00:40:44.879]  It's time for the people to quit getting scared and start standing up for their country.
[00:40:45.919 --> 00:40:46.419]  Focus!
[00:40:46.439 --> 00:40:46.759]  Stand up!
[00:40:46.799 --> 00:40:47.420]  I'm dying!
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.101]  I'm going to die here, Mr. Jones.
[00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:57.965]  You might not hear me, but I'm not letting no foreign troop handle my wife, can't speak English, and if these people want to just call in and complain, don't do nothing, that's on them.
[00:40:58.245 --> 00:41:01.947]  They're going to get theirs when they drug out of their house and get their brains stomped out.
[00:41:02.908 --> 00:41:04.589]  You have to draw the line in the sand now.
[00:41:04.869 --> 00:41:09.291]  I've been over in here, this misery, I've been looking at this misery, my heart is about to bust.
[00:41:09.772 --> 00:41:12.813]  My heart is about to bust looking at these people in the shelters.
[00:41:13.233 --> 00:41:14.234]  I am sick.
[00:41:14.714 --> 00:41:17.335]  And another thing is, I don't want nothing from nobody.
[00:41:17.615 --> 00:41:20.975]  If somebody wants these dogs, they've been calling me, take the dogs.
[00:41:21.055 --> 00:41:22.576]  I don't want money from nobody.
[00:41:22.796 --> 00:41:26.557]  All I want them to do is stand up for their country and family like men!
[00:41:26.997 --> 00:41:27.657]  Like men!
[00:41:27.917 --> 00:41:29.037]  Let's act like men!
[00:41:29.057 --> 00:41:31.318]  And if we've got to die, let's die!
[00:41:31.598 --> 00:41:34.438]  But let's do it, let's stand on our feet and do it, Mr. Jones!
[00:41:34.718 --> 00:41:36.279]  These people have got to wake up now!
[00:41:37.379 --> 00:41:37.799]  Thank you.
[00:41:38.059 --> 00:41:38.699]  God bless you.
[00:41:38.979 --> 00:41:39.960]  God bless you, Charles.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:40.960]  Take care, my friend.
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:41.640]  I mean, look.
[00:41:42.921 --> 00:41:46.303]  But again, this isn't... I don't believe the shoe's dropping right now.
[00:41:47.044 --> 00:41:49.546]  But this is a... Again, they do it in steps.
[00:41:49.566 --> 00:41:50.827]  9-11's a precursor.
[00:41:51.067 --> 00:41:53.068]  Then the next disaster is even bigger.
[00:41:53.088 --> 00:41:54.209]  Then the next one's even bigger.
[00:41:54.229 --> 00:41:56.290]  You give up more liberty, things just get worse.
[00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:58.112]  They tell you, give up liberty, everything will be alright.
[00:41:58.312 --> 00:41:59.853]  You give up liberty, it just gets worse.
[00:42:00.813 --> 00:42:03.595]  And we're just being bathed now in foreign trips.
[00:42:03.796 --> 00:42:05.897]  Bathed in martial law.
[00:42:06.037 --> 00:42:07.538]  Bathed in checkpoints.
[00:42:07.918 --> 00:42:11.481]  Bathed in people giving up their children, being put onto FEMA buses.
[00:42:13.186 --> 00:42:14.767]  I mean, I've been to all the drills.
[00:42:15.227 --> 00:42:17.849]  They never drill to bring you food and water, folks.
[00:42:18.490 --> 00:42:20.691]  They drill to break up your family and blow your head off.
[00:42:21.191 --> 00:42:22.912]  They drill to put you in forced labor camps.
[00:42:23.413 --> 00:42:25.514]  They drill to destroy this country.
[00:42:25.794 --> 00:42:28.456]  They drill to bring in... They got regions, folks.
[00:42:30.097 --> 00:42:32.239]  You're worried about Latin Americans in your area of Louisiana?
[00:42:32.279 --> 00:42:33.900]  That's not what the map shows.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:35.361]  We have the official maps.
[00:42:35.961 --> 00:42:37.462]  I've made films about this, folks.
[00:42:38.365 --> 00:42:45.368]  From the middle of Louisiana, over to Florida, up into the east, Czech Republic troops.
[00:42:45.908 --> 00:42:54.772]  They've really trained large cadres, and a smattering of Dutch troops from the Netherlands, along with British and U.S.
[00:42:54.792 --> 00:42:55.272]  commanders.
[00:42:56.272 --> 00:42:57.173]  Okay, that's that area.
[00:42:57.653 --> 00:42:58.973]  This is not a joke, folks.
[00:42:59.494 --> 00:43:00.434]  The West Coast
[00:43:01.167 --> 00:43:15.690]  The West Coast, up into Oregon, up into Washington, up into Utah, up into Wyoming and other areas, up into Canada, is Chinese troops with a smattering of Mexican troops.
[00:43:16.471 --> 00:43:21.652]  Now, the Midwest is Mexican troops, led by U.S.
[00:43:21.692 --> 00:43:22.212]  commanders.
[00:43:22.867 --> 00:43:24.608]  And they're going to have Aussies and British.
[00:43:24.668 --> 00:43:29.232]  British are, well, I mean, the Texas State Guard's led by a former SAS British commander.
[00:43:29.512 --> 00:43:32.794]  Now they federalized it and turned it into a gun confiscation crew.
[00:43:32.814 --> 00:43:37.238]  I did a whole TV show on it with a secret manual I was given by a police officer who's a member.
[00:43:38.959 --> 00:43:40.340]  And they've totally shifted.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:44.883]  And so they're going to be led by US and British troops.
[00:43:45.784 --> 00:43:48.125]  All these foreign troops will be led by our own troops.
[00:43:48.486 --> 00:43:50.147]  You understand they've been trained by them.
[00:43:52.205 --> 00:43:52.985]  You understand that?
[00:43:53.765 --> 00:43:59.867]  You see, back at 29 Palms and all the other questionnaires, will you fire on American citizens during a disaster?
[00:43:59.887 --> 00:44:00.907]  Will you take their guns?
[00:44:01.968 --> 00:44:03.808]  DDD 25, they've ordered.
[00:44:05.569 --> 00:44:08.790]  And 76% on average would say no.
[00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:10.930]  And those are still the numbers.
[00:44:11.611 --> 00:44:12.771]  They still ask them this question.
[00:44:13.651 --> 00:44:16.132]  We've interviewed just scores of troops who've been asked these questions.
[00:44:17.172 --> 00:44:19.953]  The majority say no and they go, good, right answer.
[00:44:21.090 --> 00:44:22.530]  You're going to be shipped to Europe.
[00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:23.831]  You're going to be shipped to the Balkans.
[00:44:23.851 --> 00:44:25.131]  You're going to be shipped to Macedonia.
[00:44:25.391 --> 00:44:26.852]  You're going to be shipped to 100 plus countries.
[00:44:26.872 --> 00:44:29.493]  You're going to be shipped to Afghanistan.
[00:44:29.533 --> 00:44:32.493]  And they get all the special shots and the DU and everything.
[00:44:32.994 --> 00:44:33.694]  This is how it's done.
[00:44:34.254 --> 00:44:39.536]  But that 20 something percent that says yes, they get tested, they get meted, then they're given goals.
[00:44:39.616 --> 00:44:43.457]  Okay, we're going to send you out on surveillance in a helicopter crew aiding police.
[00:44:44.097 --> 00:44:46.138]  This is a covert operation counter drug.
[00:44:46.418 --> 00:44:47.298]  You can't tell the public.
[00:44:47.955 --> 00:44:49.837]  You're going to be getting some extra cash.
[00:44:49.897 --> 00:44:54.041]  How does this extra cash and this expense card, a couple thousand a month sound?
[00:44:54.081 --> 00:44:54.901]  Well, it sounds great.
[00:44:55.242 --> 00:44:55.742]  Well, good.
[00:44:56.022 --> 00:44:57.944]  You're part of a secret front line.
[00:44:57.964 --> 00:44:58.905]  And you're listening right now.
[00:44:58.925 --> 00:45:00.226]  You're going, how does he know all this?
[00:45:00.587 --> 00:45:01.387]  This is what I do.
[00:45:01.467 --> 00:45:02.068]  Okay, troops?
[00:45:02.889 --> 00:45:03.709]  None of this is secret.
[00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.770]  You're being fooled.
[00:45:05.391 --> 00:45:09.735]  And then over the last 15 years, they've grown these cadres up to tens of thousands.
[00:45:10.583 --> 00:45:16.348]  And they're playing clothes, they got long hair, they got earrings, some of them are, you know, playing clothes, short haircuts.
[00:45:16.889 --> 00:45:19.652]  There's tens of thousands of them and they're all over the place.
[00:45:20.152 --> 00:45:22.754]  So every crop, they say, will you fire on American citizens?
[00:45:23.215 --> 00:45:31.803]  Then out of that twenty-something percent, they get about five percent that they think are good enough and sociopathic enough or gung-ho and fooled enough to be part of this and then they test them.
[00:45:32.521 --> 00:45:39.665]  In real life operations over and over again they find out the psychological test and all this who's really willing to do all this.
[00:45:40.185 --> 00:45:41.506]  And they're going to be our rulers, folks.
[00:45:41.526 --> 00:45:42.787]  They're going to pull us over.
[00:45:42.807 --> 00:45:44.928]  They're going to kick our brains out on the side of the street.
[00:45:44.948 --> 00:45:46.469]  They're going to take our guns.
[00:45:46.489 --> 00:45:47.289]  They're going to rule.
[00:45:47.809 --> 00:45:49.150]  They're going to rule over evil.
[00:45:50.131 --> 00:45:52.312]  And well, what they're going to get is hell itself.
[00:45:53.346 --> 00:45:54.887]  I mean, they are in deep, deep trouble.
[00:45:54.907 --> 00:46:00.110]  What do you think that 75% in the military, that 76% that didn't go along is going to think?
[00:46:00.530 --> 00:46:01.650]  They're not all going to be fooled.
[00:46:01.870 --> 00:46:03.411]  We outnumber you hundreds to one.
[00:46:04.672 --> 00:46:06.453]  And the globalists may not pull this.
[00:46:06.493 --> 00:46:07.954]  This is all a test, folks.
[00:46:08.374 --> 00:46:09.194]  They're testing.
[00:46:09.554 --> 00:46:12.956]  It's like they wanted to have Gonzalez before they nominated Roberts.
[00:46:14.877 --> 00:46:20.480]  But it came out that he was pro-abortion, anti-gun, pro-open border, member of a Hispanic Ku Klux Klan group.
[00:46:21.960 --> 00:46:23.940]  And all that came out, and so they dropped him.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:27.681]  And I said, maybe we shot down that trial balloon.
[00:46:27.721 --> 00:46:30.862]  Well, Bush is back, mentioning him.
[00:46:31.002 --> 00:46:34.122]  And I said, when Rehnquist leaves, he could be gone in the next six months.
[00:46:34.742 --> 00:46:35.362]  Three months ago.
[00:46:35.823 --> 00:46:36.323]  What happened?
[00:46:37.183 --> 00:46:39.703]  Now they're talking about Gonzalez.
[00:46:45.024 --> 00:46:46.104]  Another trial balloon.
[00:46:46.144 --> 00:46:47.805]  We've got to shoot down that trial balloon.
[00:46:47.825 --> 00:46:49.305]  Alright, let's go to the call.
[00:46:50.674 --> 00:46:52.475]  Let's talk to Mike.
[00:46:54.196 --> 00:46:55.677]  Mike, where are you calling us from?
[00:46:56.077 --> 00:46:56.477]  Canada.
[00:46:56.657 --> 00:46:56.978]  Welcome.
[00:46:57.858 --> 00:46:59.919]  Thank you for having me.
[00:47:00.359 --> 00:47:08.164]  First thing, 9-11 red flag for me was when Bush said, let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories, during the events of September the 11th.
[00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:10.911]  Why on earth would he say that?
[00:47:11.191 --> 00:47:14.753]  Yeah, well, two weeks after it comes on TV and don't tolerate conspiracy theories.
[00:47:14.813 --> 00:47:17.515]  Yeah, anyway, um, Dan, I'm a big fan of yours.
[00:47:18.015 --> 00:47:19.556]  I subscribe to Prison Planet TV.
[00:47:19.936 --> 00:47:20.717]  Thanks for your support.
[00:47:21.037 --> 00:47:22.158]  Oh yeah, no problem.
[00:47:22.318 --> 00:47:34.345]  Right now I'm writing an article for Bailon TV about, uh, basic kind of infighting amongst the Patriot movement, which you touched on a bit earlier, where, you know, people are kind of discrediting each other back and forth.
[00:47:35.246 --> 00:47:37.907]  But, um, one thing that the people at Wing TV
[00:47:39.386 --> 00:47:41.547]  I'm not going to have this on my show.
[00:47:41.567 --> 00:47:43.068]  I'm going to hang up on you.
[00:47:43.088 --> 00:47:43.628]  See, this is the tactic.
[00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:46.510]  There's people who don't have an advertising budget.
[00:48:02.472 --> 00:48:10.837]  Okay, and then people cynically decide to pick fights with people so that someone will then promote them to get free advertising.
[00:48:10.898 --> 00:48:13.839]  And that is... I mean, it's all false.
[00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:17.001]  And that's not even what I was talking about earlier.
[00:48:17.982 --> 00:48:22.305]  I'm talking about this whole spectrum of disinformation, and that's certainly what you mentioned is.
[00:48:23.045 --> 00:48:26.007]  I mean, we're talking about the end of this country right now, sir.
[00:48:27.068 --> 00:48:28.149]  And foreign troops.
[00:48:29.129 --> 00:48:30.070]  And see what you're doing?
[00:48:31.477 --> 00:48:33.378]  You know, the British tried this back in 1776.
[00:48:33.958 --> 00:48:40.021]  They had their dissenters and their people running around, trying to sabotage George Washington and others, and it just didn't work.
[00:48:40.902 --> 00:48:41.242]  Okay?
[00:48:41.882 --> 00:48:45.524]  And, uh, this is my show.
[00:48:46.165 --> 00:48:50.887]  It is not going to be taken over by dark, dark people.
[00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:53.528]  I mean, it's that simple.
[00:48:53.588 --> 00:49:00.392]  I mean, I've never been pushed around by the government, and I'll not be pushed around by anybody.
[00:49:01.401 --> 00:49:09.303]  I mean, I'll have the New York Times attack me, the ADL attack me, and I'll respond to that because that is a front-on attack.
[00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:11.564]  You know, that's something that has to be responded to.
[00:49:11.864 --> 00:49:22.247]  But when something's just a cynical promotion, and just an endless screed of slander and everything else you can imagine, I mean, it's just all propaganda.
[00:49:25.535 --> 00:49:25.935]  I don't know.
[00:49:25.955 --> 00:49:27.276]  I don't know if I have time.
[00:49:27.336 --> 00:49:28.617]  I might cut out what you said.
[00:49:28.637 --> 00:49:34.040]  I mean, why should we even sit here and, again, give promotion to very destructive things?
[00:49:34.861 --> 00:49:35.621]  It's unbelievable.
[00:49:36.121 --> 00:49:39.664]  It's just mind-blowing, that type of mental illness.
[00:49:40.144 --> 00:49:42.705]  All right, let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:49:43.086 --> 00:49:44.346]  Let's talk to David in Mass.
[00:49:44.386 --> 00:49:45.207]  David, you're on the air.
[00:49:45.267 --> 00:49:45.667]  Go ahead.
[00:49:46.268 --> 00:49:47.168]  Alex, how are you today?
[00:49:47.308 --> 00:49:47.668]  Good, sir.
[00:49:48.469 --> 00:49:49.790]  I just got back from Europe.
[00:49:49.830 --> 00:49:53.132]  I was there for three weeks, and I was in London for a few days.
[00:49:54.065 --> 00:49:55.266]  I took a bunch of pictures.
[00:49:55.326 --> 00:49:59.208]  There's a lot more security cameras up since I was there last.
[00:50:00.169 --> 00:50:00.609]  Everywhere.
[00:50:00.849 --> 00:50:02.610]  Well, there's four and a half million in London.
[00:50:02.890 --> 00:50:04.591]  Yeah, there's probably, yeah.
[00:50:04.611 --> 00:50:10.695]  The last time I was there, which was about a year and a half ago, I mean, I noticed them, but now I went out of my way.
[00:50:10.775 --> 00:50:12.276]  I photographed quite a few of them.
[00:50:13.277 --> 00:50:17.539]  And I even rented a car to cruise up to Manchester.
[00:50:17.639 --> 00:50:21.422]  And yeah, the toll roads, everything, it's all, they're all there everywhere.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.680]  But I thought this was interesting.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:27.521]  Right before I left, I read an article from USA Today.
[00:50:27.641 --> 00:50:28.241]  Chertoff.
[00:50:28.421 --> 00:50:30.522]  Privacy fears not justified.
[00:50:31.082 --> 00:50:42.125]  Homeland Security Michael Chertoff said, Americans need to ease their concerns about turning over personal information to the government, especially if they want to fly safe from terrorists.
[00:50:42.145 --> 00:50:44.926]  Well, they also just told Europe, give up liberty for security.
[00:50:44.966 --> 00:50:45.726]  That's the headline.
[00:50:46.066 --> 00:50:46.346]  Stay there.
[00:50:46.366 --> 00:50:48.167]  I'll briefly let you finish on the other side, David.
[00:50:48.567 --> 00:50:49.467]  Then George and others.
[00:50:51.559 --> 00:50:56.883]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, and I will give no attention to the stalkers.
[00:51:02.719 --> 00:51:05.581]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.821 --> 00:51:07.402]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[00:51:24.933 --> 00:51:29.596]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:51:29.796 --> 00:51:34.239]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:51:34.459 --> 00:51:41.684]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.

[00:53:38.919 --> 00:53:39.179]  I think so.
[00:54:17.272 --> 00:54:18.153]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:54:19.554 --> 00:54:34.125]  Oh, and just for the record, let's say if the head of the Moonies wanted to come on my show, which of course he wouldn't, and then said, hey, you better have me on your show, I'd say no way.
[00:54:34.585 --> 00:54:38.708]  And then there's nothing that, you know, hypothetically, the head of the Moonies could ever do
[00:54:39.662 --> 00:54:40.562]  To get on this show.
[00:54:40.642 --> 00:54:41.763]  There's just nothing they could do.
[00:54:43.464 --> 00:54:44.804]  You're not going to make me do anything.
[00:54:44.964 --> 00:54:46.205]  That's what my whole life is about.
[00:54:47.425 --> 00:54:49.866]  The only person that runs my life is God.
[00:54:50.486 --> 00:54:55.508]  And I have to push myself hard to let God be in control because I'm a sinful person.
[00:54:56.389 --> 00:54:57.209]  But I remember
[00:54:58.268 --> 00:55:00.149]  I remember the first stalkers I got.
[00:55:00.449 --> 00:55:06.712]  It had to be about, you know, some of the folks modern times today really you couldn't, you know, call stalkers, mainly just harassers.
[00:55:07.273 --> 00:55:13.216]  But, I mean, stalkers, you know, people hanging dead animals on my door, and I'm having physically attacked, stuff like that.
[00:55:14.016 --> 00:55:16.737]  And, of course, I gave better than I got.
[00:55:17.438 --> 00:55:19.579]  Thank the good Lord for giving me the tools.
[00:55:20.219 --> 00:55:27.943]  But, you know, it's always about, they fixate on you, and then they obsess on, you're going to give me what I want.
[00:55:28.883 --> 00:55:38.092]  And you're going to, and then they invent just these incredible, really narrative tales.
[00:55:38.933 --> 00:55:42.996]  And then there's no way to ever even respond to it, because it's just self-generating.
[00:55:44.738 --> 00:55:51.885]  And the only reason I mention that earlier, and see, I never talk about this stuff, because I'm always working so hard, it might be in my thoughts maybe two minutes a week.
[00:55:52.605 --> 00:55:56.869]  You know, when I'm reading an email or something, I mean, I meant to track down the ADL.
[00:55:56.949 --> 00:55:58.250]  I really want to sue the ADL.
[00:55:58.350 --> 00:55:59.872]  I just don't have the time or energy.
[00:56:00.592 --> 00:56:04.155]  I mean, they've got things that I didn't say on their website.
[00:56:04.836 --> 00:56:08.499]  But I just have to realize that the fight is more important.
[00:56:10.261 --> 00:56:13.664]  The fight is more important against the New World Order.
[00:56:13.724 --> 00:56:16.066]  I mean, things are way too late, folks.
[00:56:16.106 --> 00:56:18.108]  I mean, we're in the 11th hour.
[00:56:20.835 --> 00:56:30.098]  Regardless of whether Alex Jones is a good guy or a bad guy, and I'll tell you folks, I'm genuine to the core, though I'm not perfect, I can't send in Mexican troops to take your guns.
[00:56:30.258 --> 00:56:32.799]  I can't send in Czech Republic troops to take your guns.
[00:56:33.360 --> 00:56:35.320]  I can't send the IRS in to take your house.
[00:56:39.013 --> 00:56:41.314]  You know, draft your children and ship them off overseas.
[00:56:41.334 --> 00:56:47.995]  So you've got to ask yourselves, why do so many of the so-called patriots spend most of their time trying to police other patriots?
[00:56:48.396 --> 00:56:50.376]  And a lot of it's just egomaniac behavior.
[00:56:50.396 --> 00:56:54.157]  I mean, a lot of people out there, it's just they want to be big and powerful.
[00:56:54.197 --> 00:56:55.918]  They don't realize that there's no such thing.
[00:56:56.498 --> 00:56:57.238]  It's all just work.
[00:56:58.178 --> 00:57:00.699]  And they're just hateful and jealous and envious.
[00:57:00.719 --> 00:57:02.239]  I mean, you've all experienced that in business.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:07.861]  You know, you're doing better sales than the guy next to you in the next cubicle, so he hates you and tries to do stuff to you.
[00:57:08.610 --> 00:57:14.374]  There's those type of losers and they don't know why they're losers and why they never get ahead in life or why people aren't drawn to them.
[00:57:15.154 --> 00:57:17.356]  People all deep down have a compass.
[00:57:17.416 --> 00:57:18.397]  People know what's true.
[00:57:18.717 --> 00:57:21.539]  You have to delude yourself.
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:31.105]  We as a society have to get focused off the football, off the beer, off the entertainment, off the cosmetics, off the
[00:57:32.065 --> 00:57:39.086]  You know, whatever, and more focused on our families, and more focused on fighting corruption, and more... You know, all of this is part of a lack of focus.
[00:57:40.287 --> 00:57:42.567]  I mean, we're getting down now to brass tacks.
[00:57:42.587 --> 00:57:44.987]  We're getting down to the final wire.
[00:57:45.007 --> 00:57:54.209]  You know, we're getting right up to very serious times, where who knows if, you know, Alex Jones will even be on the air, or anybody for that matter, that doesn't totally worship government.
[00:57:54.709 --> 00:57:56.450]  I mean, we're getting up to the great contest.
[00:57:56.470 --> 00:57:58.370]  We're getting down to the brass knuckles fight here.
[00:57:59.247 --> 00:58:02.870]  And it's really time for people to get their heads screwed on straight.
[00:58:03.451 --> 00:58:04.832]  On a hundred different issues.
[00:58:05.332 --> 00:58:06.333]  Myself included.
[00:58:06.353 --> 00:58:11.957]  I mean, I've dedicated myself to this fight because I know the time is short.
[00:58:13.158 --> 00:58:14.179]  The old devil knows that.
[00:58:14.499 --> 00:58:15.340]  He's pushing hard.
[00:58:17.062 --> 00:58:25.008]  And... The accuser has his minions out there, but the accuser is going to lose.
[00:58:26.249 --> 00:58:27.070]  We're going to win.
[00:58:27.090 --> 00:58:28.691]  Ladies and gentlemen, but...
[00:58:29.837 --> 00:58:35.222]  We face major trials and tribulations ahead, so get your heads screwed on, folks.
[00:58:36.362 --> 00:58:37.383]  Get them screwed on straight.
[00:58:37.403 --> 00:58:39.405]  We'll be right back and get your calls.
[00:58:41.246 --> 00:58:45.830]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.523 --> 00:58:58.163]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.824 --> 00:58:59.904]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.605 --> 00:59:01.725]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.385 --> 00:59:03.186]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.926 --> 00:59:05.867]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.887 --> 00:59:09.429]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.689 --> 00:59:13.811]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.011 --> 00:59:17.233]  Alright, we're gonna accelerate through your calls in the shower.
[00:59:17.253 --> 00:59:17.313]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:22.486 --> 00:59:27.750]  Censorship, by its definition, is the government going out and not letting you start a newspaper.
[00:59:28.111 --> 00:59:30.072]  Not letting you take photographs of something.
[00:59:31.253 --> 00:59:39.039]  Censorship is not somebody knocks on your door and says, I'm moving into your house, I'm going to run your life, and if you don't let me, that's censorship.
[00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:44.544]  I've been accused of censorship before because I won't let people take over my show and run my life and be bullied.
[00:59:45.924 --> 00:59:52.349]  No, censorship is when the government has a censor sitting at the big networks telling people what can and can't go on the news.
[00:59:52.749 --> 00:59:56.732]  That's the Encyclopedia Britannica definition.
[00:59:57.153 --> 01:00:00.175]  That's the definition in the Webster's Dictionary.
[01:00:00.955 --> 01:00:02.557]  That's the description of it.
[01:00:03.637 --> 01:00:11.003]  For those that just joined the stations out there, a guy earlier was trying to raise the fact that I've had people before trying to call in here to make this their own private promotion arm.
[01:00:11.895 --> 01:00:14.397]  And I won't put up with it, and that censorship.
[01:00:14.417 --> 01:00:14.717]  No, no, no.
[01:00:14.737 --> 01:00:18.900]  The censorship, if I went out... People, again, don't know what words mean.
[01:00:19.561 --> 01:00:28.428]  If I went out, and let's say you started a newsletter in your neighborhood, and I came and had the police come, and I was the government, and we confiscated your newspaper.
[01:00:28.768 --> 01:00:29.488]  That's censorship.
[01:00:29.909 --> 01:00:33.251]  What FEMA is doing is censorship, and we're not putting up with it.
[01:00:33.812 --> 01:00:34.592]  Up on Infowars.com,
[01:00:37.654 --> 01:00:42.416]  We posted the photos, and by the way, we wouldn't have posted these.
[01:00:43.536 --> 01:00:47.637]  But because FEMA says we shouldn't, we have posted them.
[01:00:48.118 --> 01:01:00.542]  I mean, we see the dead people from World War II, the dead citizens and troops in the Civil War, much more gruesome than these, and it's on PBS during the family hour.
[01:01:01.862 --> 01:01:03.563]  They showed it to us in middle school, and
[01:01:04.250 --> 01:01:06.011]  You know, when I was growing up in Rockwall, Texas.
[01:01:06.051 --> 01:01:08.232]  So, why not show the dead?
[01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:13.355]  Because it shows what a horrible job the government did.
[01:01:13.455 --> 01:01:15.316]  FEMA censors photos of the dead.
[01:01:15.737 --> 01:01:16.017]  I.E.
[01:01:16.057 --> 01:01:20.859]  they do not allow you to go and take photos.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:27.183]  Now, would it be censorship if you had a photo journal online and someone said, you've got to post my photos?
[01:01:28.208 --> 01:01:28.488]  Well, no.
[01:01:28.568 --> 01:01:29.529]  I own my own website.
[01:01:29.550 --> 01:01:30.711]  I own my own photo journal.
[01:01:31.211 --> 01:01:33.294]  I don't have to post your photos on my website.
[01:01:33.474 --> 01:01:33.734]  Ha!
[01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:34.715]  Censored!
[01:01:34.915 --> 01:01:35.476]  No, no, no, no.
[01:01:35.576 --> 01:01:36.537]  That's not censorship.
[01:01:37.498 --> 01:01:38.199]  That's called freedom.
[01:01:40.051 --> 01:01:40.751]  You understand that?
[01:01:41.132 --> 01:01:45.894]  But this is censorship, what FEMA's doing, not allowing you to get in and take photos.
[01:01:46.034 --> 01:01:47.235]  That's censorship.
[01:01:47.255 --> 01:01:48.796]  So we'll go over that.
[01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:52.038]  Mexican military enters Texas for the first time since 1846.
[01:01:53.278 --> 01:01:59.482]  FEMA made 1,000 firefighters take sexual harassment class while New Orleans drowned.
[01:02:00.583 --> 01:02:01.803]  White House, Ms.
[01:02:01.903 --> 01:02:06.546]  Bush comment was personal, basically talking about what a bunch of losers the people are.
[01:02:07.532 --> 01:02:09.653]  There, and of course, she was acting all friendly and loving.
[01:02:09.933 --> 01:02:11.534]  I just love you, child.
[01:02:11.574 --> 01:02:16.576]  As she turns away, these people are better off.
[01:02:16.656 --> 01:02:18.077]  My beautiful mind.
[01:02:18.097 --> 01:02:21.618]  Theme of still blocking firefighters and police from entering New Orleans.
[01:02:22.178 --> 01:02:23.619]  Major stuff going on.
[01:02:23.639 --> 01:02:25.640]  It's out of control.
[01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.161]  Let's finish up with a caller who's been holding a David Maskell.
[01:02:28.181 --> 01:02:29.201]  Go ahead.
[01:02:29.241 --> 01:02:29.461]  Hi, Alex.
[01:02:29.501 --> 01:02:33.063]  I want to say one quick thing as to how it relates to Katrina.
[01:02:33.946 --> 01:02:36.447]  Have you ever heard of Colonel Tom Bearden?
[01:02:37.127 --> 01:02:39.268]  His website, have you ever seen that?
[01:02:39.308 --> 01:02:40.668]  Yeah, he gets into weather control.
[01:02:40.989 --> 01:02:43.529]  He gets into scalar electromagnetic technology.
[01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:58.995]  I was reading something yesterday, apparently it was on his forum or some sort of email exchange, and he seems to think that, I mean his theory anyway, I know it gets a little conspiratorial, but he seems to think that weather modification has definitely played a big part in
[01:02:59.608 --> 01:03:00.969]  A lot of these things that we've missed seeing.
[01:03:01.009 --> 01:03:01.589]  You know what?
[01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:03.110]  I'll get Colonel Bearden on.
[01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:06.933]  We had the Weather Wars guy on yesterday and he's in the Moscow News today.
[01:03:07.513 --> 01:03:20.301]  Yeah, but he inferred that one scalar interferometer could knock out, and he believed this was going to happen within the next year, year and a half, the entire power grid nationwide.
[01:03:20.981 --> 01:03:21.742]  What better way?
[01:03:21.842 --> 01:03:26.805]  Well, you know, the government was doing some, and this was admitted, a power drill test
[01:03:27.638 --> 01:03:29.499]  When, uh, the blackout two years ago?
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:30.220]  Yep.
[01:03:30.680 --> 01:03:31.221]  Year and a half ago.
[01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:31.881]  Remember that?
[01:03:32.361 --> 01:03:33.122]  That's right, yep.
[01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:34.423]  That was about two years ago now.
[01:03:34.443 --> 01:03:35.744]  Yeah, it was right around two years ago.
[01:03:36.504 --> 01:03:37.585]  Alright, thank you for the calls.
[01:03:37.625 --> 01:03:38.045]  Great points.
[01:03:38.065 --> 01:03:40.307]  Yeah, I keep meaning to get Colonel Tom Bearden on.
[01:03:40.327 --> 01:03:44.370]  In fact, before I forget, send an instant message over to my producer, uh, guys.
[01:03:44.430 --> 01:03:45.871]  Let's get Tom Bearden on.
[01:03:46.531 --> 01:03:48.492]  Alright, we'll be, uh, right back with more of your calls.
[01:03:48.953 --> 01:03:49.993]  Stay with us, presentplanet.tv.
[01:03:54.042 --> 01:04:01.426]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[01:04:01.686 --> 01:04:06.429]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[01:04:06.649 --> 01:04:12.292]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[01:04:12.532 --> 01:04:17.057]  Witness in horror, the execution of the September 11th attacks, and the ensuing whitewash.
[01:04:17.297 --> 01:04:24.465]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:28.490]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:28.970]  Much more.
[01:04:29.151 --> 01:04:31.652]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the Masters of Terror.
[01:04:31.893 --> 01:04:38.658]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[01:04:38.858 --> 01:04:44.122]  Order online now at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or by calling 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.142 --> 01:04:44.542]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:53.872 --> 01:05:02.916]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as trimethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[01:05:03.177 --> 01:05:12.201]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water,
[01:05:12.481 --> 01:05:14.402]  Into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:05:14.742 --> 01:05:20.465]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury and aluminum are no problem.
[01:05:20.705 --> 01:05:27.349]  Foul tastes like chlorine and obnoxious sulfur odors are removed without removing the healthful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:05:27.569 --> 01:05:34.393]  Black Berkey elements flow one and a half to two times faster than ordinary gravity elements, which means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:34.653 --> 01:05:36.454]  Supercharge your gravity filter today.
[01:05:36.694 --> 01:05:38.755]  Upgrade to Black Berkey purification elements.
[01:05:38.975 --> 01:05:39.916]  Get a two-pack for only $96.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:59.145]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[01:05:59.465 --> 01:06:04.747]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[01:06:05.167 --> 01:06:08.129]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.
[01:06:08.749 --> 01:06:09.190]  We're good to go.
[01:06:29.352 --> 01:06:30.672]  Just $19 for one year.
[01:06:30.893 --> 01:06:32.633]  That's 50% off the regular price.

[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:00.161]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.882 --> 01:07:01.983]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.643 --> 01:07:03.464]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.204 --> 01:07:05.706]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.766 --> 01:07:09.749]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.949 --> 01:07:14.093]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:17.155 --> 01:07:21.739]  We have got to maintain our focus on the fact that foreign troops are in America.
[01:07:21.759 --> 01:07:25.582]  Our government has signed agreements, has signed deals,
[01:07:28.763 --> 01:07:37.106]  With Mexico and Canada to bring in foreign troops, to quote, deal with natural disasters and terrorists, to fight terrorists.
[01:07:37.726 --> 01:07:41.207]  These are Washington Post, AP articles, three years ago.
[01:07:41.847 --> 01:07:43.788]  The agreements have been signed the last two years.
[01:07:44.801 --> 01:07:46.562]  The Canadians are freaked out over it.
[01:07:46.642 --> 01:07:47.583]  So are the Mexicans.
[01:07:47.983 --> 01:07:49.724]  But our governments are all lovey-dovey.
[01:07:50.024 --> 01:07:54.587]  And now, all these Mexican troops in San Antonio and Dallas.
[01:07:55.328 --> 01:07:56.228]  Oh, helping.
[01:07:56.248 --> 01:07:58.710]  The message is Americans can't help Americans.
[01:08:00.030 --> 01:08:01.231]  Only foreign troops can.
[01:08:01.271 --> 01:08:04.113]  And folks, I was at the Austin Convention Center last night.
[01:08:05.594 --> 01:08:08.055]  Where the fight for 5,000 of the refugees are.
[01:08:08.075 --> 01:08:09.636]  There's another couple thousand around the city.
[01:08:09.656 --> 01:08:12.138]  In people's homes and at the Burger Center.
[01:08:13.035 --> 01:08:15.836]  And, I mean, it was just wallowing in goods.
[01:08:15.956 --> 01:08:21.037]  It looked like ships being offloaded and, you know, the port in San Diego.
[01:08:21.157 --> 01:08:26.859]  I mean, giant containers, literally brand new goods given by companies, by citizens.
[01:08:27.979 --> 01:08:30.480]  It was just wall-to-wall piles.
[01:08:30.520 --> 01:08:31.640]  You had to walk around it.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:33.201]  Stuff being driven in.
[01:08:34.201 --> 01:08:36.102]  Just huge stacks of cots.
[01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:37.342]  I mean, it's a joke!
[01:08:38.931 --> 01:08:43.116]  FEMA had warehouses in Louisiana, in Houston.
[01:08:43.277 --> 01:08:46.220]  They were ready to bring food and water in within minutes of it happening.
[01:08:46.561 --> 01:08:47.962]  They've done that in all the other hurricanes.
[01:08:48.463 --> 01:08:52.949]  They held back so things would fall apart so there was a perception of a need.
[01:08:54.170 --> 01:08:55.312]  You understand that, folks?
[01:08:57.034 --> 01:09:04.678]  They told them to go to the Superdome and then didn't help them for four or five days to get riots going, and then go, see, we need more troops!
[01:09:04.718 --> 01:09:06.279]  We need to get rid of Posse Comitatus!
[01:09:06.579 --> 01:09:07.640]  We need foreign troops!
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:12.702]  We don't... Look, day one, FEMA doesn't have water filters.
[01:09:12.722 --> 01:09:15.664]  I mean, they have some, but their main focus is delivering water bottles.
[01:09:15.744 --> 01:09:16.104]  Stupid.
[01:09:16.584 --> 01:09:18.705]  Well, the French, you know, give out water filters.
[01:09:19.486 --> 01:09:25.329]  It's the old thing of, fish for somebody and give them fish, or teach them how to fish and give them a rotten reel.
[01:09:26.593 --> 01:09:27.314]  Teach them how to fish.
[01:09:27.694 --> 01:09:34.679]  The French were ready the first day, because they had a bunch of big aircraft in the Caribbean and some French islands to fly in.
[01:09:34.819 --> 01:09:39.202]  Big water filters, big systems to clean the water, and also smaller filters.
[01:09:39.582 --> 01:09:40.943]  And our government said, no, no, no.
[01:09:41.263 --> 01:09:41.924]  We don't need it.
[01:09:42.424 --> 01:09:45.246]  And in a way, they didn't, because FEMA did have the supplies.
[01:09:45.506 --> 01:09:47.307]  They just held them up on purpose.
[01:09:47.348 --> 01:09:48.228]  That's been admitted.
[01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:55.073]  And, you know, now they're talking about Alberto Gonzalez again for the Supreme Court.
[01:09:56.343 --> 01:09:58.486]  I mean there's just no end to what's happening here.
[01:09:58.826 --> 01:09:59.987]  Let's go to calls.
[01:10:02.190 --> 01:10:03.131]  Let's go ahead and
[01:10:06.394 --> 01:10:08.595]  Talk to George in Canada.
[01:10:08.615 --> 01:10:09.895]  George, go ahead.
[01:10:10.135 --> 01:10:10.975]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:10:11.075 --> 01:10:11.575]  Hi, George.
[01:10:11.815 --> 01:10:17.196]  What I'd like to bring up is there's been some credible witnesses that saw people tampering with the levees.
[01:10:17.577 --> 01:10:32.920]  No, that's even been in some of the local news that some of the locals saw, well, even after things were breaking in the first few days, FEMA employees breaking more of the levees, but there were reports of flashes and explosions before they collapsed.
[01:10:33.365 --> 01:10:39.471]  I'd like to just point out a source or two for your listeners so that they can retrieve the information before it disappears down the memory hole.
[01:10:39.651 --> 01:10:40.172]  Sure, good idea.
[01:10:40.212 --> 01:10:46.939]  I was in the Toronto Globe and Mail on September the 5th and there was a juvenile detention officer near one of the levees.
[01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:49.568]  And he is quoted as saying, we heard a loud boom.
[01:10:49.928 --> 01:10:53.388]  We thought it was a generator at first, but then we later learned it was a levy.
[01:10:53.809 --> 01:10:59.810]  Give us that headline, because for some reason I posted that last week and then couldn't find it this morning.
[01:11:00.350 --> 01:11:01.350]  What was the headline on that?
[01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:05.811]  Then we heard, oh pardon me, the headline is, we thought we'd be fine this time.
[01:11:06.632 --> 01:11:09.712]  Thought we'd be fine this time.
[01:11:10.012 --> 01:11:12.453]  Fine this time.
[01:11:12.493 --> 01:11:13.253]  Will you do me a favor?
[01:11:14.113 --> 01:11:16.654]  Will you email that to tips at Infowars.com right now?
[01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:23.622]  Oh, I have emailed it to your webmaster in an article I wrote called, Key Bono Mr. Bush, and the link is in there with the quotes.
[01:11:23.702 --> 01:11:24.883]  Did we post your article?
[01:11:25.423 --> 01:11:26.564]  I don't think so, but I don't know for sure.
[01:11:26.584 --> 01:11:30.946]  Okay, I'm going to put you on hold right now, and I'm going to bring you back up.
[01:11:31.266 --> 01:11:33.488]  Hey, Scott, give him my secret email.
[01:11:34.888 --> 01:11:36.309]  And we're going to bring you right back up.
[01:11:36.909 --> 01:11:38.290]  You know my secret email, right, Scott?
[01:11:39.911 --> 01:11:40.171]  Okay.
[01:11:41.031 --> 01:11:42.872]  And even the secret one now gets like 150 a day.
[01:11:44.511 --> 01:11:57.485]  But anybody that wants to write articles for us, anybody that wants to collate information, tipsandinfowars.com and I'll find out right now when you send it.
[01:11:57.545 --> 01:11:59.708]  Folks, I'm wallowing in information right now.
[01:12:00.208 --> 01:12:03.231]  There were two local news stations, TV stations, one of them was Channel 9.
[01:12:05.245 --> 01:12:11.546]  I can't draw up the call letters that also reported that gentleman and two cops that saw explosions.
[01:12:11.986 --> 01:12:18.908]  But we're just supposed to ignore that, and a whole bunch of the Ninth Ward people saw it, but you know, they're black people, so we can't really listen to them.
[01:12:18.928 --> 01:12:20.568]  So racist.
[01:12:20.588 --> 01:12:22.448]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:12:22.769 --> 01:12:26.229]  What the tragedy is, is everybody dies in these situations.
[01:12:26.249 --> 01:12:30.610]  There's a report of 500 dead, or possibly dead, missing in action police officers.
[01:12:31.170 --> 01:12:34.751]  So you're not really protecting anyone by not joining with us
[01:12:35.407 --> 01:12:43.009]  Your sacrifice, just like everyone else, when they decide to do some sort of takedown for whatever reason, we all die together.
[01:12:43.049 --> 01:12:47.490]  We died in the World Trade Center, we died in New Orleans, and we'll die in the next episode.
[01:12:47.870 --> 01:12:49.071]  We have to work together.
[01:12:49.111 --> 01:12:49.931]  We're not enemies.
[01:12:50.451 --> 01:12:53.272]  They only make us enemies so that we can't join against them.
[01:12:53.712 --> 01:12:56.172]  But NBC Nightly News did a piece as well.
[01:12:56.413 --> 01:13:01.854]  They did an extended segment on Monday, September the 5th as well, and they interviewed a man who was on the levy.
[01:13:02.222 --> 01:13:11.827]  And he heard the explosions and he said this on the news and they brought the mayor in to contradict him because he just said it was done to save the white neighborhoods so they just shot him down.
[01:13:12.047 --> 01:13:15.069]  He didn't understand the greater things that we understand.
[01:13:15.209 --> 01:13:21.533]  Of course, Jesse Jackson and all these idiots say stupid things and then that makes Bush and others look good.
[01:13:22.093 --> 01:13:22.553]  Exactly.
[01:13:22.953 --> 01:13:27.256]  So another thing that's come down today is the president has used
[01:13:27.956 --> 01:13:32.737]  A lot of persuasion to tell the media to keep the body count, the total body count, a secret.
[01:13:33.197 --> 01:13:46.041]  So you'll probably get information about body bags that's probably you're being told by other media surreptitiously that that's what the body count is, is how many body bags they had to use because they're not going to come flat out and tell us.
[01:13:46.381 --> 01:13:50.602]  This is probably one of the greatest disasters that's ever befallen the United States.
[01:13:50.822 --> 01:13:52.962]  Well something like 9,000 people died in 1909 when
[01:13:55.903 --> 01:13:58.806]  A hurricane slammed into Galveston, Texas.
[01:13:59.526 --> 01:14:00.127]  Oh, exactly.
[01:14:00.407 --> 01:14:05.492]  And so, if that killed 9,000, I mean, I wonder how many this killed.
[01:14:06.573 --> 01:14:09.776]  I would speculate that the highest order for body bags I heard was 30,000.
[01:14:10.536 --> 01:14:19.084]  And then a New Orleans police commander was interviewed on National Public Radio on Monday, so that's five days ago almost,
[01:14:19.708 --> 01:14:20.929]  And he said the death count was 20,000.
[01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:24.111]  Yeah, I've heard 10,000 to 30,000.
[01:14:24.171 --> 01:14:25.172]  Nobody really knows.
[01:14:25.512 --> 01:14:27.853]  And then FEMA says nobody can take photos.
[01:14:28.254 --> 01:14:29.595]  Nobody can take pictures.
[01:14:29.995 --> 01:14:39.281]  Well, that's one of the big reasons why aid was held out of the city is professional rescue people would have noticed the damage to the levees and known it wasn't a natural occurrence.
[01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.162]  So they wanted to keep out professional rescuers.
[01:14:41.322 --> 01:14:43.143]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:14:44.716 --> 01:14:57.181]  You are so on target, exactly just like FEMA came in and wouldn't let anybody take photos or any real emergency people or demolitions experts get in to the wreckage of the World Trade Centers because it would prove the controlled demolition.
[01:14:57.221 --> 01:15:05.804]  They had to hurry up and mutilate those levees and throw a bunch of stuff on it and bulldoze them and kind of pile them in together to cover that up.
[01:15:06.477 --> 01:15:07.557]  You are absolutely right.
[01:15:07.597 --> 01:15:09.418]  Listen, I want to get your article posted.
[01:15:09.518 --> 01:15:10.398]  I recognize your voice.
[01:15:10.438 --> 01:15:12.458]  You've sent us other good stuff in the past.
[01:15:13.138 --> 01:15:15.198]  We will get your article posted right now.
[01:15:15.279 --> 01:15:16.279]  Just send it to Producer.
[01:15:16.639 --> 01:15:17.059]  Very good.
[01:15:17.119 --> 01:15:18.739]  The lives we save may be our own.
[01:15:19.139 --> 01:15:19.479]  All right.
[01:15:19.539 --> 01:15:19.979]  Take care.
[01:15:20.039 --> 01:15:20.759]  Great points.
[01:15:20.799 --> 01:15:22.020]  That's a fabulous caller.
[01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:25.720]  And you know, I had an admonition at the first of the show.
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:30.601]  I said, you know, let's stay focused on real issues instead of distractions.
[01:15:30.641 --> 01:15:35.782]  That was not an entree to people to start the squabbling.
[01:15:36.761 --> 01:15:40.063]  I mean, that was desperation, and I'm telling you folks, we've got to stay focused.
[01:15:40.663 --> 01:15:44.586]  I mean, this is about survival of our families, our freedom, our futures here.
[01:15:45.786 --> 01:15:53.171]  And there are just so many provocateurs, so many egomaniacs, so many government agencies like
[01:15:54.893 --> 01:16:08.336]  ADL and others, and then you've got Jesse Jackson on the other side who comes out and says it's because America hates black people, and then that makes the government screw-ups look good because what Jackson's saying is so stupid.
[01:16:08.356 --> 01:16:10.696]  You know, he's CFR, folks.
[01:16:11.096 --> 01:16:12.476]  This is all scripted out.
[01:16:13.337 --> 01:16:14.377]  This is all scripted.
[01:16:15.297 --> 01:16:16.777]  And you've got to get some discernment.
[01:16:18.458 --> 01:16:20.778]  You know, stay focused on real issues, folks.
[01:16:21.762 --> 01:16:24.164]  Let's go to Kathy and then Kevin and then Reuben and Jim.
[01:16:24.784 --> 01:16:26.525]  Kathy and Tehosh, go ahead Kathy.
[01:16:26.686 --> 01:16:40.815]  Yes, I wanted to say Governor Blanco has resisted a federal takeover of Louisiana and I heard yesterday when she was asked what her response was to Tom DeLay's accusation that it was the local and state failures that caused delay in relief to the hurricane victims.
[01:16:41.276 --> 01:16:44.378]  She said, you know not what of you speak.
[01:16:44.998 --> 01:16:49.061]  Now my question to you is what is your opinion of her and what do you think is going on there?
[01:16:50.359 --> 01:16:57.143]  Well, we actually have a big timeline up on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, at least I told them to post it a few minutes ago.
[01:16:58.023 --> 01:17:01.525]  But WhatReallyHappened.com has it up at the top, and it's pretty accurate.
[01:17:01.705 --> 01:17:05.827]  And we know that New Orleans was already federalized two and a half years ago.
[01:17:05.987 --> 01:17:09.269]  Every major agency, the city was run by the feds.
[01:17:10.309 --> 01:17:12.130]  And they didn't repair the levees.
[01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:13.931]  The Washington Post can lie all day.
[01:17:13.991 --> 01:17:14.872]  We have the documents.
[01:17:16.252 --> 01:17:18.173]  Again, the liberal paper defending Bush.
[01:17:18.193 --> 01:17:19.194]  See how staged it is?
[01:17:20.023 --> 01:17:22.065]  That we know then that FEMA wouldn't.
[01:17:22.386 --> 01:17:24.888]  We know FEMA jammed the police communications.
[01:17:24.948 --> 01:17:28.052]  Folks, they jammed them from the minute the hurricane hit.
[01:17:28.412 --> 01:17:31.675]  That's why we now learn that over two-thirds of the police went off duty.
[01:17:32.256 --> 01:17:39.143]  Because literally FEMA jammed to make sure things fell apart so FEMA then could legitimize an even bigger takeover.
[01:17:39.604 --> 01:17:42.687]  And it would ensure that flooding didn't get repaired.
[01:17:43.457 --> 01:17:47.978]  And, uh, you know, I haven't confirmed that there were bombs in there, but I believe there were from the eyewitnesses.
[01:17:48.278 --> 01:17:49.878]  Everything else fits the paradigm.
[01:17:50.218 --> 01:17:56.540]  All over the state and in New Orleans, police lines being cut by FEMA while they jam the police lines.
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:18:00.280]  My goodness, this is hidden in plain view!
[01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:03.341]  Well, what do you think, though, of her role in this?
[01:18:03.441 --> 01:18:05.441]  I mean, she's resisting the federal takeover.
[01:18:05.461 --> 01:18:09.622]  No, she did resist, and that's why she's been demonized and roundly attacked and lied about.
[01:18:11.223 --> 01:18:12.923]  Right, but why do you think she's doing this?
[01:18:13.741 --> 01:18:15.821]  Why do you think she's resisting?
[01:18:16.362 --> 01:18:22.743]  If she knew that this was what they wanted to do... You know, I'm not inside her mind.
[01:18:22.963 --> 01:18:23.743]  I don't read minds.
[01:18:23.903 --> 01:18:26.204]  So we really don't know at this point?
[01:18:26.304 --> 01:18:28.244]  Well, I mean, most of these people aren't pure evil.
[01:18:28.284 --> 01:18:32.805]  It's like they have that parish president on who says FEMA's cutting the lines and sabotaging.
[01:18:32.865 --> 01:18:34.985]  I mean, he doesn't have the whole picture, but he's telling the truth.
[01:18:35.306 --> 01:18:36.506]  He's breaking down crying.
[01:18:37.026 --> 01:18:42.047]  Look, it's a few thousand evil globalists manipulating the rest of us through disinformation.
[01:18:42.976 --> 01:18:47.881]  And, uh, you know, I mean... Well, it's a hero if he's standing against them.
[01:18:48.202 --> 01:18:48.822]  No, I hear you.
[01:18:48.842 --> 01:18:50.904]  Look, that's why they gotta manage the information.
[01:18:54.298 --> 01:19:02.220]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon, a hot dog was a nickel, and a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.121]  What happened to those prices?
[01:19:04.641 --> 01:19:08.002]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[01:19:08.022 --> 01:19:13.903]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[01:19:14.363 --> 01:19:14.903]  The result?
[01:19:15.344 --> 01:19:16.604]  Inflation was born.
[01:19:17.104 --> 01:19:19.165]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[01:19:21.146 --> 01:19:22.048]  What can you do about it?
[01:19:22.468 --> 01:19:24.773]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar!
[01:19:25.612 --> 01:19:30.954]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[01:19:31.374 --> 01:19:36.557]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[01:19:36.997 --> 01:19:39.478]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[01:19:39.958 --> 01:19:45.880]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[01:19:46.341 --> 01:19:48.642]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now!
[01:19:53.314 --> 01:19:58.618]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.

[01:21:12.907 --> 01:21:19.910]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:25.492]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[01:21:25.732 --> 01:21:26.352]  Thanks for watching!
[01:21:52.995 --> 01:21:57.378]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of different medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:21:57.618 --> 01:21:59.279]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:21:59.439 --> 01:22:02.141]  Yes, I said drinking water, but not just any water.
[01:22:02.321 --> 01:22:06.603]  You need Electrolyzed Oxidized Water, or EO, from RPA Biotech.

[01:22:56.340 --> 01:22:58.842]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:22:59.342 --> 01:23:02.144]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.504 --> 01:23:06.006]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:23:06.026 --> 01:23:10.629]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:23:11.069 --> 01:23:15.332]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[01:23:15.872 --> 01:23:17.693]  The ring of fire.
[01:23:18.074 --> 01:23:19.614]  And it burns, burns, burns.
[01:23:19.655 --> 01:23:23.377]  I'll tell you folks, love is a burning thing.
[01:23:24.501 --> 01:23:26.742]  And it makes a fiery ring.
[01:23:27.982 --> 01:23:30.323]  You know, life is such an adventure.
[01:23:30.403 --> 01:23:33.444]  Life is so transitory, so delicate, so precious.
[01:23:33.964 --> 01:23:36.625]  And I've stepped up to the plate for the adventure.
[01:23:37.585 --> 01:23:40.266]  And I enjoy standing up against the evil.
[01:23:40.426 --> 01:23:43.507]  I am blessed for all the adversities and all the trials we've had.
[01:23:44.007 --> 01:23:46.268]  Every time we're persecuted, it comes in waves.
[01:23:46.808 --> 01:23:49.169]  And it'll just intensify from a hundred different fronts.
[01:23:49.549 --> 01:23:52.530]  We're always blessed whenever we persevere.
[01:23:53.877 --> 01:24:01.340]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com, both the sites have doubled in their traffic and size in the last two years.
[01:24:03.401 --> 01:24:08.543]  You know, more growth, really, in the last year and a half than we've had in all the six, seven years before that.
[01:24:10.563 --> 01:24:17.926]  And tens of millions of people coming to InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and that's a great responsibility.
[01:24:18.086 --> 01:24:20.047]  I am humbled by that.
[01:24:21.687 --> 01:24:23.148]  I am greatly humbled by that.
[01:24:24.865 --> 01:24:27.207]  And, uh, you know, we try to do the best job we can.
[01:24:27.227 --> 01:24:29.689]  And, man, I just want to thank all of you out there.
[01:24:29.709 --> 01:24:34.813]  I mean, I am humbled by the fact that I am on so many big AM and FM stations across this country.
[01:24:35.234 --> 01:24:43.761]  I am humbled by the fact that, you know, foreign governments purchase my documentary films.
[01:24:44.882 --> 01:24:48.685]  I am humbled by the fact that so many people
[01:24:49.967 --> 01:24:51.207]  Pay attention to what we do.
[01:24:51.747 --> 01:24:52.988]  I'm just an average person.
[01:24:53.368 --> 01:24:55.388]  And I'm here to tell you, you can be leaders too.
[01:24:55.488 --> 01:24:57.529]  You can be great leaders.
[01:24:58.489 --> 01:25:00.269]  You have greater minds than I do.
[01:25:01.089 --> 01:25:02.590]  If you're doing it for the right reason.
[01:25:02.690 --> 01:25:03.590]  If you're dedicated.
[01:25:03.710 --> 01:25:04.630]  If you don't stop.
[01:25:05.070 --> 01:25:06.010]  If you move forward.
[01:25:06.110 --> 01:25:07.190]  If you're not distracted.
[01:25:07.551 --> 01:25:10.151]  If you're not baited into diversions.
[01:25:11.251 --> 01:25:13.032]  If you're not foiled in what you're doing.
[01:25:13.512 --> 01:25:14.712]  If you're single-minded.
[01:25:15.885 --> 01:25:17.786]  We can defeat the New World Order.
[01:25:17.826 --> 01:25:20.167]  We're going to defeat the New World Order.
[01:25:21.147 --> 01:25:26.749]  I started my fight against the New World Order eleven years ago on cable TV.
[01:25:27.290 --> 01:25:28.530]  Ten years ago on radio.
[01:25:30.891 --> 01:25:37.154]  And I just knew I was sick and tired of the propaganda, sick and tired of the lies, sick and tired of the manipulation.
[01:25:37.674 --> 01:25:40.295]  And I was just one person and
[01:25:41.064 --> 01:25:54.032]  By joining together with others, and by being relentless, and by pouring myself out, I have been strengthened, my horizons have been expanded, and we have reaped a mighty harvest of people that we've woken up.
[01:25:54.593 --> 01:25:56.114]  I'm just one person in this fight.
[01:25:56.594 --> 01:25:58.075]  Folks, activate yourselves.
[01:25:58.155 --> 01:25:59.296]  Be the leaders you are.
[01:25:59.476 --> 01:26:01.777]  Ask God to use you in the fight.
[01:26:02.498 --> 01:26:05.880]  Ask God to lead God and direct you, and you will be risen up.
[01:26:06.160 --> 01:26:07.281]  You will be raised up.
[01:26:08.090 --> 01:26:11.632]  As a standard, against the enemy, when the enemy comes in like a flood.
[01:26:13.093 --> 01:26:13.734]  It's that simple.
[01:26:18.077 --> 01:26:19.878]  Let's go to Kevin in Texas.
[01:26:19.918 --> 01:26:20.478]  Kevin, go ahead.
[01:26:20.498 --> 01:26:22.059]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:26:22.299 --> 01:26:22.540]  Good.
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.882]  Are you still asking for smoking guns on 9-11?
[01:26:26.762 --> 01:26:28.063]  It's whatever you want to talk about.
[01:26:28.464 --> 01:26:29.204]  I'll start with that.
[01:26:30.625 --> 01:26:36.649]  Other than the fact that I had in my mind your July 25th show, very fresh, that you called it,
[01:26:37.304 --> 01:26:41.647]  And then it happened, but I guess the other smoking gun was there was no fighter intercept out of Langley.
[01:26:41.687 --> 01:26:45.550]  The first tactical fighter wing stood down, so there was a big red flag.
[01:26:45.991 --> 01:26:48.413]  Yeah, 20 miles away, there's jets loaded with missiles.
[01:26:48.493 --> 01:26:50.775]  And that's their job.
[01:26:50.935 --> 01:26:54.938]  They have an hour and 25 minutes to do something.
[01:26:57.039 --> 01:27:03.545]  You know, last night when we were at IHOP and that pastor, that Hispanic pastor, came over and said what big fans they were.
[01:27:03.665 --> 01:27:05.166]  He's never even heard your radio show.
[01:27:05.186 --> 01:27:06.467]  It was just the television show.
[01:27:07.148 --> 01:27:20.337]  And by the way, a lot of the bloggers are commenting on how fantastic your last two shows were, and I'd really recommend people get out there and get on Prison Planet, sign up, and get to watch your TV shows if they're not in the Austin area, because the last two were just fantastic.
[01:27:20.517 --> 01:27:20.918]  Really were.
[01:27:20.938 --> 01:27:23.159]  This is my buddy Kevin Smith.
[01:27:23.459 --> 01:27:30.684]  Kevin, what do you think about just more articles coming out where they're cutting more lines, blocking more firefighters, blocking more food?
[01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:34.527]  I mean, we've caught them red-handed, Kevin.
[01:27:35.509 --> 01:27:40.931]  Well, I've got a little, like a ten second long audio clip from Nancy Pelosi that I think is real revealing.
[01:27:40.991 --> 01:27:43.933]  I'm no fan of hers, don't get me wrong, but I'll play that with your permission.
[01:27:43.953 --> 01:27:45.133]  Yeah, go ahead and roll it, Kevin.
[01:27:45.854 --> 01:27:46.714]  Okay, hold on.
[01:27:47.054 --> 01:27:48.595]  Let me, okay, hold on one sec.
[01:27:49.095 --> 01:27:49.335]  Sure.
[01:27:51.116 --> 01:27:55.038]  Kevin had a chance last night to see the convention center as well in downtown Austin.
[01:27:55.938 --> 01:27:57.599]  Believe me, folks, they're getting plenty of aid.
[01:27:57.619 --> 01:27:58.719]  No credentials.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:27:59.760]  And you know what?
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:04.282]  When I said to the President that he should fire Michael Brown, he said, why would I do that?
[01:28:04.781 --> 01:28:09.222]  I said because of all that went wrong with all that didn't go right last week.
[01:28:09.342 --> 01:28:10.462]  And he said, what didn't go right?
[01:28:11.422 --> 01:28:11.982]  Oblivious.
[01:28:12.462 --> 01:28:13.122]  In denial.
[01:28:14.143 --> 01:28:14.643]  Dangerous.
[01:28:17.563 --> 01:28:19.524]  Yeah, Kevin, that's a powerful clip.
[01:28:19.604 --> 01:28:20.144]  Oblivious.
[01:28:20.204 --> 01:28:20.764]  In denial.
[01:28:20.804 --> 01:28:21.284]  Dangerous.
[01:28:21.624 --> 01:28:22.424]  What didn't go right?
[01:28:23.384 --> 01:28:24.144]  What didn't go right?
[01:28:25.025 --> 01:28:25.285]  Yeah.
[01:28:26.165 --> 01:28:27.005]  Anything else, Kevin?
[01:28:27.585 --> 01:28:29.065]  Yeah, hold me for a second on the other side.
[01:28:29.425 --> 01:28:29.805]  Alright.
[01:28:30.326 --> 01:28:32.646]  We'll be right back with Kevin Smith and we'll go to
[01:28:33.624 --> 01:28:39.890]  Ruben, Tim, Esther, Ron, and others, and I am going to get into more of the news before this hour ends.
[01:28:39.930 --> 01:28:41.371]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:28:43.734 --> 01:28:44.634]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.115 --> 01:28:46.736]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.637 --> 01:28:50.320]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.073 --> 01:28:56.515]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[01:28:57.295 --> 01:29:02.918]  Over the last 40 years, we've seen prayer and God thrown out of the schools by decisions of the U.S.
[01:29:02.958 --> 01:29:03.719]  Supreme Court.
[01:29:04.479 --> 01:29:08.782]  Yet on February 29, 1892, in an eye-nothing decision of the U.S.
[01:29:08.822 --> 01:29:12.424]  Supreme Court, America was declared a Christian nation.
[01:29:13.425 --> 01:29:18.648]  There is an ongoing assault on your First Amendment right of freedom of religion and freedom of assembly.
[01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:27.764]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:29.325 --> 01:29:31.086]  Just call our toll-free number 1-800-516-8736.
[01:29:31.106 --> 01:29:31.466]  That's 1-800-516-8736.
[01:29:39.532 --> 01:29:41.656]  516-8736.
[01:29:43.379 --> 01:29:43.980]  Call now.
[01:29:44.121 --> 01:29:50.693]  Operators are standing by to receive your call for a free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.
[01:29:53.388 --> 01:29:56.409]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[01:29:56.710 --> 01:30:01.652]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.892 --> 01:30:06.254]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.554 --> 01:30:15.458]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.658 --> 01:30:19.300]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.580 --> 01:30:24.626]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.907 --> 01:30:31.615]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.122 --> 01:30:32.763]  What about you?
[01:30:33.423 --> 01:30:38.768]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.
[01:30:38.828 --> 01:30:39.848]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:39.989 --> 01:30:41.890]  Order today and save $14 by calling 1-888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.574 --> 01:30:55.937]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:30:56.177 --> 01:31:00.020]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.?
[01:31:00.341 --> 01:31:01.161]  Read the labels.
[01:31:01.602 --> 01:31:05.746]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:05.946 --> 01:31:10.130]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:31:10.510 --> 01:31:15.375]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:31:15.755 --> 01:31:19.297]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my CalBen Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:31:19.517 --> 01:31:24.861]  It's all natural, earth friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:31:25.141 --> 01:31:27.862]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:31:28.163 --> 01:31:29.063]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:29.363 --> 01:31:40.090]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with CalBen Pure Soaps.
[01:31:40.470 --> 01:31:41.871]  Call CalBenPureSoap free at 1-800-340-7091.
[01:31:41.911 --> 01:31:42.932]  That's 800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[01:32:04.841 --> 01:32:09.003]  When the levy breaks, they have no place to stay.
[01:32:09.823 --> 01:32:14.265]  Going down, going down now, going down.
[01:32:16.506 --> 01:32:21.288]  When the levy breaks, the truth is going to pour out and they lose the New World Order.
[01:32:24.269 --> 01:32:27.771]  They can pull their little scams, but they're not going to be able to get away with it.
[01:32:29.011 --> 01:32:30.792]  Alright, Kevin, finish up what you were saying.
[01:32:30.812 --> 01:32:33.173]  Yeah, last night we finished the TV show, you come down and visited.
[01:32:33.926 --> 01:32:35.667]  You guys drove past the convention center.
[01:32:35.687 --> 01:32:37.307]  Why don't you describe what you saw first?
[01:32:38.387 --> 01:32:40.828]  Definitely an overflowing of goods.
[01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:44.329]  They're not wanting for anything as far as material.
[01:32:44.349 --> 01:32:46.149]  I mean, it's ridiculous.
[01:32:46.209 --> 01:32:47.570]  I actually walked over there later.
[01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:51.771]  It was just... I mean, I'm glad people are giving them this much stuff, including my family.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:55.282]  My wife's like offloaded half of our clothes on them.
[01:32:55.783 --> 01:32:59.205]  But, I mean, at the same time, they need money now.
[01:32:59.545 --> 01:33:04.950]  This $2,000 is chicken feet, and that's supposedly the full extent of it.
[01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:14.457]  They need to be given interest-free loans and be, you know, moved in to, you know, just, you know, small, you know, middle class housing.
[01:33:14.857 --> 01:33:15.778]  That needs to happen.
[01:33:16.738 --> 01:33:20.100]  Well, according to Barbara Bush, they're doing better than they were before now, so...
[01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:49.759]  I'm sure she decontaminated after she left there.
[01:33:49.879 --> 01:33:53.081]  Well, the point is that they were the funders of Margaret Sanger.
[01:33:53.121 --> 01:33:54.562]  I'm glad a caller mentioned that.
[01:33:54.602 --> 01:33:57.983]  I mean, Margaret Sanger called black people weeds, folks.
[01:33:58.283 --> 01:34:01.985]  But you notice that the blacks, the Jesse Jacksons, just love her.
[01:34:02.685 --> 01:34:05.387]  He's a good CFR Judas goat.
[01:34:05.947 --> 01:34:07.708]  And I mean, I'm just sick of it.
[01:34:08.148 --> 01:34:12.431]  And folks, she's the one that on NBC, remember, and then they took it off the transcript.
[01:34:12.451 --> 01:34:15.152]  She was the one on NBC that just, they said, what about the dead troops?
[01:34:15.652 --> 01:34:18.934]  Why should I bother my beautiful mind with them dead people?
[01:34:18.954 --> 01:34:19.895]  I just love my life.
[01:34:20.215 --> 01:34:22.016]  I don't think about them for a minute.
[01:34:23.057 --> 01:34:27.219]  Wasn't it Jesse Jackson that said, hey, Dr. Kane, I got something to show you out here on the balcony.
[01:34:27.259 --> 01:34:28.460]  Come out here, I want to show you something.
[01:34:29.894 --> 01:34:39.917]  I'll tell you what, as far as the Mexican troops go, Alex, apparently at 8.15 AM this morning, the first 45 vehicles crossed the International Bridge in Laredo.
[01:34:39.977 --> 01:34:43.418]  So, they're going to San Antonio, then apparently to Dallas and Houston.
[01:34:43.898 --> 01:34:50.660]  If, you know, our listeners down there in San Antonio, if I had to guess, I would say it was probably Fort San Houston is where they were going.
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:53.381]  Get your video cameras out there, get us some footage for that.
[01:34:54.062 --> 01:35:08.352]  And one last thing, the people I talked to last night that came over and spoke to you and heaped praise on you for being so brave, when I spoke to them it turns out they were Pentecostals and they understood completely the whole resistance to tyranny as obedience to God.
[01:35:08.372 --> 01:35:10.353]  It wasn't something that was foreign to them.
[01:35:10.433 --> 01:35:18.299]  They understood that and I was just really impressed to be able to find somebody that goes to church regularly in Austin, Texas that understands.
[01:35:18.914 --> 01:35:25.779]  Well, I have a good friend who's been arrested and spent six months in jail for protesting abortion clinics, and don't say his name.
[01:35:25.799 --> 01:35:31.764]  I mean, I guess we can if we want, but I mean, he's a nice guy, but he's just totally, totally changed.
[01:35:31.784 --> 01:35:32.985]  Well, he's George Woolley.
[01:35:33.625 --> 01:35:36.928]  When we've had him on as a guest, I was thinking I wouldn't say his name, but he doesn't care.
[01:35:37.568 --> 01:35:40.110]  And he attacks me readily on TV, so why not talk about it?
[01:35:40.631 --> 01:35:44.854]  And George came up to me in the parking lot last night and gave me the Bible on tape!
[01:35:45.413 --> 01:35:46.433]  They're really expensive.
[01:35:46.453 --> 01:35:48.694]  And he said, I just think you're getting away from the Lord.
[01:35:49.314 --> 01:35:51.394]  And I said, well, man, I'm certainly a sinner, George.
[01:35:51.435 --> 01:35:57.496]  I'm not perfect, but... And he just told me, he said, I don't think the founding fathers should have fought the Tories.
[01:35:57.916 --> 01:35:59.416]  God puts government over us.
[01:35:59.837 --> 01:36:02.837]  And I'm like, George, you're the one that goes to jail for six months.
[01:36:03.517 --> 01:36:10.619]  You know, when Bill Clinton was in office, and Alberto Gonzales is pro-abortion, well, Bush is just of the Lord, and we just need to do what he says.
[01:36:11.139 --> 01:36:13.540]  And he has totally changed.
[01:36:14.120 --> 01:36:19.021]  And I know so many Christians now who just do not even know what's happening.
[01:36:19.362 --> 01:36:26.904]  They're so blinded by Bush, who one day is praying to the Shinto Shrine, the next day he's praying to Allah, the next day to Jesus.
[01:36:27.304 --> 01:36:31.465]  But when he gets behind closed doors, folks, it's to a black idol.
[01:36:32.425 --> 01:36:35.666]  In Skull and Bones, they kneel before a big Grim Reaper.
[01:36:36.166 --> 01:36:42.428]  At a Bohemian Grove, this is mainstream news by the way, at Bohemian Grove they kneel before Moloch.
[01:36:43.558 --> 01:36:47.680]  I mean, my point is, is just there's so... Well, we had a big argument with him last night, didn't we?
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:50.781]  And George just cannot get it, man.
[01:36:50.821 --> 01:36:52.741]  He just... He's totally changed.
[01:36:52.801 --> 01:36:54.802]  It's like body snatchers got him.
[01:36:55.202 --> 01:36:55.983]  I haven't changed.
[01:36:56.043 --> 01:37:02.905]  I'm the same person I was ten years ago, you know, when me and George were, uh, you know, getting on TV talking bad about abortion.
[01:37:03.405 --> 01:37:04.986]  I'm the same person I was then.
[01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:11.088]  George is just totally, and he's worried about me now, worried about my soul because I'm against Bush.
[01:37:12.048 --> 01:37:12.869]  Well, I think.
[01:37:13.289 --> 01:37:15.591]  If you look really deeply into their eyes, they know.
[01:37:15.691 --> 01:37:16.751]  They know deep down inside.
[01:37:16.811 --> 01:37:18.853]  But if they admit it, then what are they going to do?
[01:37:18.873 --> 01:37:20.294]  They're going to have to do something about it.
[01:37:20.434 --> 01:37:27.359]  Well, I had George run up to me in the parking lot after 9-11 and go, we all do need chips to prove we're good, but Muslims are going to kill us!
[01:37:28.019 --> 01:37:29.040]  And I'm just like, George, what?
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:30.161]  Get a hold of yourself!
[01:37:32.492 --> 01:37:38.377]  We met some good ones last night, and I was really impressed with them and their knowledge base.
[01:37:38.697 --> 01:37:58.794]  Then Ricky Sparkman, I was arguing with George about the Founding Fathers, barely getting ready for the TV show because of this, out in the parking lot, and Ricky Sparkman, who's the big Protestant anti-abortion guy, and of course George is a Catholic, these two are like double-teaming me, and I'm sitting there, and I'm going, now Ricky, you know full well that the Founding Fathers,
[01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:06.994]  You know, that Romans 13 didn't say they shouldn't fight back against the king, and the whole Bible is about standing up against evil governments.
[01:38:07.134 --> 01:38:12.879]  All the prophets and the disciples, they're all being killed, you know, 90% of them, you know, by governments.
[01:38:13.259 --> 01:38:21.826]  And Ricky's like, well, you're right, because the Founding Fathers knew government was evil, and that men were evil, but I think you think government's evil and that men are good.
[01:38:21.906 --> 01:38:23.767]  No, I know we're inherently got problems.
[01:38:23.807 --> 01:38:24.328]  We are evil.
[01:38:25.229 --> 01:38:26.329]  No, you don't think that.
[01:38:26.650 --> 01:38:28.451]  So he was even telling me what I thought.
[01:38:29.332 --> 01:38:31.634]  I don't know what to say anymore.
[01:38:32.475 --> 01:38:38.419]  George's problem last night with Lance Armstrong wasn't the problem that we all see in him and have with him and the potential problem.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:44.284]  His problem was that he got a divorce and didn't want to hear what we were telling him about some of the reasons.
[01:38:45.723 --> 01:38:48.285]  It's sad, but I was really happy to meet those people last night.
[01:38:48.305 --> 01:38:53.488]  You know, I'm always on the lookout for a church that I can attend in Austin that's not, you know, a government whorehouse.
[01:38:53.528 --> 01:38:56.910]  So, I don't think I'm ready to become a Pentecostal, but it was refreshing.
[01:38:56.930 --> 01:39:00.011]  Well, yeah, maybe we'll go join the Mexican Pentecostal Church.
[01:39:00.572 --> 01:39:01.572]  Hey Alex, have a good one, man.
[01:39:01.632 --> 01:39:02.493]  Alright, take care.
[01:39:03.413 --> 01:39:05.295]  No, there are some good churches out there.
[01:39:06.916 --> 01:39:09.457]  But, I just don't know what to say anymore.
[01:39:11.098 --> 01:39:12.459]  To see people blinded
[01:39:14.483 --> 01:39:20.965]  It must have been like that in Germany, you know, where one brother knows Hitler's bad, the other brother thinks Hitler's good, and you know, families broke up.
[01:39:22.045 --> 01:39:24.066]  It happened in the Civil War, families broke up.
[01:39:26.707 --> 01:39:42.052]  There were Mexicans, Tejanos, who were, you know, one brother would write the Texas Constitution, and he'd be elite, you know, number three in the Texas government, and the other brother fought for Santa Ana, you know, I mean, that kind of stuff happens, but I mean, I got old friends, folks,
[01:39:42.768 --> 01:39:47.431]  That I've gone out and protested with and demonstrated with now that are just like zombies.
[01:39:48.151 --> 01:39:49.452]  I mean, they're not the same people.
[01:39:50.193 --> 01:39:52.314]  And it's like a spirit of deception.
[01:39:52.514 --> 01:39:53.595]  I don't know how to explain it.
[01:39:54.455 --> 01:39:57.137]  You know, it's like when we try to expose Bill Clinton.
[01:39:57.157 --> 01:40:01.940]  I remember talking to Democrats and going, look, I'm not saying Republicans are good.
[01:40:01.980 --> 01:40:03.501]  I'm just saying Bill Clinton's a traitor.
[01:40:03.801 --> 01:40:04.561]  He's really bad.
[01:40:04.601 --> 01:40:05.562]  He's selling us out.
[01:40:05.922 --> 01:40:07.203]  Gun control isn't good.
[01:40:07.483 --> 01:40:08.163]  Just shut up.
[01:40:08.183 --> 01:40:09.284]  Don't talk about Bill Clinton.
[01:40:09.644 --> 01:40:12.246]  Because they had invested themselves in Bill Clinton.
[01:40:13.015 --> 01:40:14.156]  He's like their daddy.
[01:40:14.657 --> 01:40:16.498]  Even women go, he's like my father.
[01:40:17.039 --> 01:40:18.320]  Just Bill Clinton.
[01:40:18.380 --> 01:40:19.941]  I just couldn't imagine he's bad.
[01:40:22.584 --> 01:40:25.326]  And you watch, folks, when Democrats get into office down the road.
[01:40:25.827 --> 01:40:27.769]  Bush may be setting the table for martial law.
[01:40:27.789 --> 01:40:32.453]  Then they may bring in a Democrat, you know, who's fresh with the public.
[01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:35.536]  So it takes time for the public to wake up to how evil they are.
[01:40:37.208 --> 01:40:46.535]  And suddenly the Democrats, all the Democrats that have been out protesting against Patriot Act 1 and 2 and protesting against the war, they're not going to be protesting anymore.
[01:40:46.555 --> 01:40:52.780]  And then suddenly there'll be all these conservatives going, it's of the Lord to expose the government!
[01:40:53.761 --> 01:40:54.841]  It's in the Bible!
[01:40:55.222 --> 01:40:57.584]  And right now it's evil to expose the government.
[01:40:57.604 --> 01:40:58.704]  George Bush is the government.
[01:40:58.744 --> 01:41:02.067]  I mean literally folks, I know people that are flip-flopping back and forth
[01:41:03.402 --> 01:41:07.304]  This is the mind control that we face as a nation.
[01:41:08.884 --> 01:41:10.785]  I mean, look at the fruits of Bush.
[01:41:11.525 --> 01:41:13.206]  Look at everything he's done.
[01:41:13.226 --> 01:41:15.207]  And again, he is a puppet.
[01:41:15.267 --> 01:41:16.347]  He's a figurehead.
[01:41:16.828 --> 01:41:20.369]  Meant to absorb all the criticism, or absorb all the praise.
[01:41:20.929 --> 01:41:24.991]  Meanwhile, these big financial interests own him like they own real estate.
[01:41:26.686 --> 01:41:28.848]  Let's go to Ruben in Ohio.
[01:41:28.908 --> 01:41:29.609]  Ruben, go ahead.
[01:41:29.989 --> 01:41:31.831]  Alex, I've got three things for you real quick.
[01:41:32.011 --> 01:41:35.834]  Number one, you're valuable to the country, but don't burn out.
[01:41:35.874 --> 01:41:37.876]  Don't light those candles at both ends.
[01:41:37.896 --> 01:41:39.477]  You know, your family needs you, too.
[01:41:40.638 --> 01:41:42.620]  Number two... There's Mexican troops in Texas.
[01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:43.581]  I've got to go cover it.
[01:41:43.981 --> 01:41:47.424]  Alex, you've got to take time for that family.
[01:41:49.025 --> 01:41:51.485]  You're not going to be good to anybody if you burn yourself out.
[01:41:52.146 --> 01:41:54.026]  Just think about it.
[01:41:54.486 --> 01:42:00.027]  You could be like that guy that said Eureka when he finally took a bath and figured out displacement or whatever.
[01:42:00.567 --> 01:42:03.068]  But the second thing is, in K.T.
[01:42:03.128 --> 01:42:08.449]  Frankovich's book, Where Heavens Meet, which was written about Hurricane Andrew.
[01:42:08.469 --> 01:42:11.129]  Yeah, what FEMA did, the tens of thousands that really died.
[01:42:11.529 --> 01:42:13.770]  Right, and the official death toll was 26.
[01:42:15.785 --> 01:42:17.670]  But really, it was like you said, thousands more.
[01:42:17.690 --> 01:42:21.720]  And then the third thing is 9-11 anniversary is coming up.
[01:42:22.101 --> 01:42:24.026]  Now we got Mexican troops in our country.
[01:42:25.570 --> 01:42:30.612]  It's a perfect time for the globalists to launch a terror attack in the next few months.
[01:42:32.353 --> 01:42:38.535]  I don't know, but I'll tell you, we're at the most dangerous point we've ever been, and every day we get deeper into this, it gets more dangerous.
[01:42:38.815 --> 01:42:41.056]  Well, what I want to know is about stock trading.
[01:42:41.096 --> 01:42:45.317]  Is there any expert you could have on that could tell us if there's anything funny going on with the stock?
[01:42:45.357 --> 01:42:46.778]  You've got to constantly watch it.
[01:42:47.718 --> 01:42:55.343]  The British government did pound manipulations two days before the 7-7 bombing, and Alan Greenspan did.
[01:42:55.363 --> 01:43:01.286]  The CIA did insider trading on the exact two airlines at record put options four days before 9-11.
[01:43:02.347 --> 01:43:05.889]  And every time they pull something off, they cash in right in front of us.
[01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:07.390]  And nobody gets in trouble.
[01:43:07.610 --> 01:43:10.072]  Look, Bill Clinton set the forest fires out west.
[01:43:10.392 --> 01:43:11.153]  That was admitted.
[01:43:12.074 --> 01:43:13.975]  FEMA openly didn't fix these levees.
[01:43:14.115 --> 01:43:25.644]  And in order to stand down and jam police communications, and cut police communications, and wouldn't let food and water get in to cause bigger riots as a pretext for control, we catch them red-handed every time!
[01:43:27.785 --> 01:43:31.288]  Well, I just want to know if there's something going on with the stock market.
[01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:34.014]  You've got to watch it.
[01:43:34.174 --> 01:43:35.395]  I don't understand the market.
[01:43:35.435 --> 01:43:37.596]  I'm just saying maybe you know some experts.
[01:43:37.616 --> 01:43:39.718]  Well, you're talking about getting a headache or burnout.
[01:43:39.738 --> 01:43:43.460]  I mean, the best minds in the country can't hardly keep track of that thing.
[01:43:43.900 --> 01:43:44.161]  All right.
[01:43:44.201 --> 01:43:45.141]  That's all I've got, Alex.
[01:43:45.502 --> 01:43:45.842]  All right.
[01:43:45.902 --> 01:43:46.662]  Thank you.
[01:43:46.702 --> 01:43:48.404]  That's mainly what the NSA does.
[01:43:48.484 --> 01:43:49.945]  It's track the stock market.
[01:43:50.745 --> 01:43:56.069]  Let's say you instant message your cousin about an idea you've got for a children's book.
[01:43:57.606 --> 01:44:00.448]  And they actually have market analysts in the NSA.
[01:44:00.468 --> 01:44:02.629]  That's about 90% of what they do.
[01:44:03.129 --> 01:44:06.911]  And then they flag that idea and pass it on to, you know, Simon and Schuster.
[01:44:08.152 --> 01:44:13.594]  Or you've got an idea for a new catalytic converter that will triple gas mileage and you're about to sell it to the Chinese.
[01:44:13.614 --> 01:44:16.716]  Well, you die two days later of a car accident.
[01:44:16.756 --> 01:44:19.137]  Your computer gets hit by an EMP wave.
[01:44:19.577 --> 01:44:19.937]  Literally.
[01:44:20.118 --> 01:44:20.438]  Literally.
[01:44:20.458 --> 01:44:21.018]  I'm not joking.
[01:44:21.773 --> 01:44:33.580]  And then the rest of NSA is busy making sure that government terrorist attacks go forward, or making sure that if an FBI or CIA agent is finding out about a government operation, that they're called off the case.
[01:44:34.780 --> 01:44:43.505]  It's also used to track drug dealers that don't pay their cut into the government, and to stick drug interdiction on them, but to make sure police don't go after government shipments.
[01:44:43.525 --> 01:44:45.366]  I mean, that's what the NSA does.
[01:44:47.227 --> 01:44:50.389]  And they've got the PROMIS software and a bunch of other systems and they track it.
[01:44:51.292 --> 01:44:54.595]  And then you did have NSA people go public and go, hey, we got insider trading!
[01:44:54.615 --> 01:44:55.796]  And they were told, shut up!
[01:44:56.216 --> 01:44:57.577]  That's our insider trading.
[01:44:57.898 --> 01:44:58.518]  Shut up!
[01:44:59.499 --> 01:45:00.640]  You know, they're not all bad.
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:06.485]  It's compartmentalized analysts in there, doing their job, passing it on.
[01:45:07.465 --> 01:45:19.956]  In the words of one NSA connection, the NSA, if they hear everybody talking about strawberries, strawberries, strawberries for six months, and there's all these connections to strawberries, that's passed on to the proper industries, and then
[01:45:20.822 --> 01:45:25.708]  You know, you see the new pattern come out for the new style in the fall of strawberries.
[01:45:26.829 --> 01:45:27.650]  I mean, literally, folks.
[01:45:27.730 --> 01:45:29.232]  I mean, it comes down to that.
[01:45:30.454 --> 01:45:31.996]  That's how controlled it is.
[01:45:32.636 --> 01:45:35.019]  But we do the same thing here, but we're an organic NSA.
[01:45:36.044 --> 01:45:55.084]  There's millions of patriots, millions of truth seekers, millions of us on the web, millions of websites, tracking, listening to every word they say, cross-referencing, looking at backgrounds, doing investigations, killing the regional media, integrating the media out of the regions, and stopping the gatekeepers.
[01:45:56.358 --> 01:46:03.926]  I mean, it's just a fractal in its complexity, but we're the organic NSA and we are crushing them!
[01:46:04.306 --> 01:46:05.367]  We are crushing you!
[01:46:05.608 --> 01:46:06.669]  You cannot stop us!
[01:46:07.209 --> 01:46:08.511]  We will defend America!
[01:46:09.091 --> 01:46:18.441]  Alright, let's go ahead and, again, we are an organic NSA integrated with the electronic NSA DARPA system via the Internet.
[01:46:19.699 --> 01:46:21.160]  They plan to have it be a cage.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:26.822]  We merged with it and expanded beyond its boundaries and have now created something new.
[01:46:27.342 --> 01:46:33.584]  Alright, let's go ahead and talk to Tim in Ohio, then I'm going to cover some news for this hour.
[01:46:33.604 --> 01:46:34.165]  Go ahead, Tim.
[01:46:34.465 --> 01:46:35.305]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:46:35.565 --> 01:46:36.145]  Hi, my friend.
[01:46:36.165 --> 01:46:41.127]  I wanted to call you back and tell you that I wrote that article about the Navy recruiter who threatened me with arrest.
[01:46:41.207 --> 01:46:43.128]  I emailed it to tips at InfoWars.com.
[01:46:44.170 --> 01:46:45.471]  We will get that posted.
[01:46:45.491 --> 01:46:46.912]  We will get the other articles posted.
[01:46:47.292 --> 01:46:50.234]  Earlier you were talking about the weather wars.
[01:46:50.274 --> 01:46:56.339]  You had Scott Stevens on and there was another person whose name came up, I forget, I think he was... Colonel Tom Bearden.
[01:46:56.539 --> 01:46:57.259]  Tom Bearden, yeah.
[01:46:57.519 --> 01:46:59.581]  Also, Dr. Richard C. Hoagland.
[01:47:00.762 --> 01:47:04.004]  He's on with George on Coast to Coast quite a bit and he was talking about
[01:47:04.611 --> 01:47:10.656]  Remember last year when we had three of those four hurricanes that hit Florida that like all crossed over the same county?
[01:47:11.056 --> 01:47:12.577]  Yeah, what is he saying is doing that?
[01:47:13.197 --> 01:47:19.402]  He's of the belief that they do have the technology to steer these hurricanes and it goes all the way back to like Nikola Tesla stuff.
[01:47:19.442 --> 01:47:20.163]  I have some tapes on it.
[01:47:20.183 --> 01:47:20.643]  I'll try to get it.
[01:47:20.663 --> 01:47:22.064]  Well, Hoagland's been calling me.
[01:47:22.104 --> 01:47:23.105]  Maybe he wants to come on.
[01:47:23.145 --> 01:47:24.306]  Yeah, I think he would.
[01:47:24.326 --> 01:47:27.468]  And you know, one thing that you always say to us is, uh, kibono.
[01:47:27.868 --> 01:47:28.929]  Who, who benefits?
[01:47:29.249 --> 01:47:30.130]  And even
[01:47:30.726 --> 01:47:40.271]  If this was a natural disaster without any outside interference until it reached land, what they're doing is using this hurricane as a cover.
[01:47:41.252 --> 01:47:43.533]  This is the beginning of the takeover.
[01:47:43.793 --> 01:47:49.336]  Oh, this is their perfect laboratory training op conditioning mechanism.
[01:47:49.376 --> 01:47:50.057]  Thanks for the call.
[01:47:50.577 --> 01:47:51.658]  Really fabulous points.
[01:47:53.231 --> 01:47:58.195]  We'll continue into the third hour with your calls, because the callers bring up so many news items that are important.
[01:47:58.675 --> 01:48:00.797]  FEMA censors photos of the dead.
[01:48:00.877 --> 01:48:02.318]  Again, this is free censorship.
[01:48:02.919 --> 01:48:13.587]  When the government goes out and tells you you can't take pictures of something, or tells you you can't report on something, that's the encyclopedia and dictionary definition of censorship.
[01:48:14.308 --> 01:48:21.494]  Censorship is not that I won't have, you know, people on this show lauding the virtues of S&M.
[01:48:23.399 --> 01:48:26.921]  Though I just choose, in my media outlet, to not talk about that.
[01:48:28.441 --> 01:48:28.981]  You understand?
[01:48:29.582 --> 01:48:33.543]  Censorship is if the government won't let you say the F word in your magazine.
[01:48:34.164 --> 01:48:37.305]  Censorship is not where I don't let you say that on my show.
[01:48:37.645 --> 01:48:38.465]  That's my choice.
[01:48:39.226 --> 01:48:40.246]  Just to be clear on that.
[01:48:41.087 --> 01:48:43.348]  There's a lot of stupid people out there that don't understand that.
[01:48:44.748 --> 01:48:47.529]  You know, it's like I won't have people on this show pushing space aliens.
[01:48:47.829 --> 01:48:51.171]  It's because I choose that I don't think that that's credible.
[01:48:51.901 --> 01:48:57.468]  And you can mention it if you're a caller if you want, but I'm not a censor because I won't have the space alien crowd on my show.
[01:48:58.909 --> 01:48:59.770]  That's not censorship.
[01:49:00.071 --> 01:49:06.338]  But if I went out and I was the government and I stopped people from talking about space aliens, then that would be censorship.
[01:49:06.358 --> 01:49:07.299]  You understand that, folks?
[01:49:08.000 --> 01:49:10.323]  FEMA censors photos of the dead.
[01:49:11.696 --> 01:49:12.176]  When U.S.
[01:49:12.236 --> 01:49:22.563]  officials asked the media not to take pictures of those killed by Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, they were censoring a key part of the disaster story Free Speech Watchdog said.
[01:49:23.783 --> 01:49:30.507]  The move by the Federal Emergency Management Agency is in line with the Bush Administration's ban on images of flag-draped U.S.
[01:49:30.548 --> 01:49:34.770]  coffins returning from the Iraq War, media monitors said in separate telephone interviews.
[01:49:35.310 --> 01:49:38.993]  I'll continue with this in a big news blitz that will go about 20 minutes into the next hour.
[01:49:39.493 --> 01:49:41.094]  It's starting on the other side of this break.
[01:49:42.092 --> 01:49:45.393]  And then we'll continue with your calls, but I'm going to cover news now.
[01:49:46.794 --> 01:49:49.455]  So stay with us, but this is just outrageous.
[01:49:49.715 --> 01:49:52.756]  So we've posted the photos of the dead on InfoWars.
[01:49:54.496 --> 01:49:57.357]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.597 --> 01:49:59.178]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.518 --> 01:50:04.220]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.540 --> 01:50:11.242]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.602 --> 01:50:13.583]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[01:50:13.783 --> 01:50:16.624]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.724 --> 01:50:21.385]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.585 --> 01:50:25.987]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.227 --> 01:50:33.449]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.710 --> 01:50:36.110]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.290 --> 01:50:38.011]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:54.241 --> 01:50:57.244]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.604 --> 01:51:06.433]  It's portable and requires no water pressure so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.753 --> 01:51:11.418]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.878 --> 01:51:18.622]  The Burton Elite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:19.003 --> 01:51:30.810]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.270 --> 01:51:35.734]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[01:51:35.894 --> 01:51:38.216]  Get the Murky Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:41.498 --> 01:51:42.939]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:51:42.959 --> 01:51:44.020]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:54.830 --> 01:52:00.778]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:52:00.999 --> 01:52:03.262]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:03.462 --> 01:52:09.811]  We provide outstanding products like ECAC, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:10.171 --> 01:52:10.791]  I think so.
[01:52:30.458 --> 01:52:30.858]  I think so.
[01:52:57.461 --> 01:52:58.202]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:52:58.302 --> 01:53:03.008]  Grab your pens and paper, because I'm going to briefly talk about my documentaries in the online bookstore we have.
[01:53:03.348 --> 01:53:04.430]  Then I'll get into the news.
[01:53:05.611 --> 01:53:08.214]  About 20 minutes into the next hour, we'll cover news.
[01:53:08.855 --> 01:53:11.378]  Up until about 20 minutes into the next hour, then go back to your calls.
[01:53:13.326 --> 01:53:15.367]  But, uh, I have produced twelve documentary films.
[01:53:15.387 --> 01:53:18.868]  The latest is Martial Law, 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[01:53:19.328 --> 01:53:20.828]  It is a mini-series.
[01:53:20.908 --> 01:53:32.032]  It covers the latest police state developments, how they're preparing for Martial Law, how the Globalists carried out 9-11, and then their ideology, their philosophy, their world plan, why they want control.
[01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:34.473]  They gotta get control to carry out their plans.
[01:53:35.433 --> 01:53:36.473]  And it's three hours long, $25.95.
[01:53:36.513 --> 01:53:39.254]  You get a second copy for $19, a third copy for $16, a fourth copy for $14,
[01:53:42.839 --> 01:53:53.706]  You can get my last film, American Dictators, that is excellent documenting the false left-right paradigm and the skull and bones connection for only $5.95 when you buy one copy for $19.95.
[01:53:55.087 --> 01:53:59.310]  As many copies as you want for $5.95 after you buy one copy for $19.95.
[01:54:00.031 --> 01:54:05.735]  Because I just want you to get four or five copies and give them as gifts or maybe sell them in your bookstore or at your gas station.
[01:54:06.435 --> 01:54:06.916]  Whatever!
[01:54:06.976 --> 01:54:08.737]  Just get these out or at your church.
[01:54:09.197 --> 01:54:10.478]  Just get these out to people.
[01:54:11.815 --> 01:54:19.718]  The total free number to get my documentaries is 1-888-253-3139.
[01:54:20.699 --> 01:54:24.740]  When you call that number, they can answer all your questions.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:25.240]  888-253-3139.
[01:54:25.761 --> 01:54:28.982]  The best place to order really is InfoWars.com.
[01:54:29.582 --> 01:54:39.166]  Because all the videos are there, you can watch clips or trailers of all the films, you can read about them, see all the different discounts and order via the safe, secure online shopping cart.
[01:54:41.036 --> 01:54:46.800]  Or, you can go to PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:49.021]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:54:49.041 --> 01:54:50.342]  15 cents a day.
[01:54:50.482 --> 01:54:51.723]  Monthly and yearly subscriptions.
[01:54:51.783 --> 01:54:53.023]  My weekly TV reports.
[01:54:53.444 --> 01:54:54.664]  Most weeks there's two reports.
[01:54:55.105 --> 01:54:56.445]  Every week there's at least one report.
[01:54:57.026 --> 01:55:01.028]  Special video reports you won't see on TV or in my films.
[01:55:01.248 --> 01:55:02.069]  Just on the website.
[01:55:03.750 --> 01:55:05.210]  All my best audio interviews.
[01:55:05.390 --> 01:55:06.051]  Transcripts.
[01:55:07.003 --> 01:55:08.144]  Just so much, folks.
[01:55:08.264 --> 01:55:08.924]  All my films.
[01:55:08.944 --> 01:55:10.165]  A bunch of other documentaries.
[01:55:10.606 --> 01:55:11.006]  My book.
[01:55:11.046 --> 01:55:11.927]  Paul Watson's book.
[01:55:12.307 --> 01:55:13.848]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:14.268 --> 01:55:15.629]  PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:55:16.130 --> 01:55:22.074]  And your membership funds the... How many webmasters do I have?
[01:55:22.094 --> 01:55:22.074]  1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[01:55:23.675 --> 01:55:28.078]  Then we've got some web designers we're paying to redesign the sites.
[01:55:28.558 --> 01:55:30.760]  The bandwidth, the servers, the IT guy.
[01:55:31.280 --> 01:55:34.783]  I mean, we've got a pretty good sized operation here and you make it possible.
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:37.261]  So, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:55:38.001 --> 01:55:38.462]  All right.
[01:55:41.163 --> 01:55:47.067]  Again, we wrote a little article this morning on Infowars.com explaining why we posted the photos.
[01:55:47.847 --> 01:55:53.050]  You know, first off, they say you can't take photos of the coffins and the flags.
[01:55:53.631 --> 01:55:56.372]  Even when families want photos taken, they say no.
[01:55:57.133 --> 01:56:00.995]  Then a family in Louisiana earlier this year did want photos taken, so it was allowed.
[01:56:01.696 --> 01:56:07.982]  The fact that the colonel disregarded the direct order of the general and let the family have it come off with some honors.
[01:56:09.683 --> 01:56:14.708]  But never in our history have they snuck the debt off in the quote, transportation tubes.
[01:56:15.008 --> 01:56:16.430]  They're no longer called body bags.
[01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:19.092]  They have new politically correct terms for it.
[01:56:19.933 --> 01:56:22.375]  And it's all part of not letting you see the consequences.
[01:56:22.415 --> 01:56:24.177]  While FEMA has done a great job
[01:56:24.910 --> 01:56:34.394]  A horrible job for the public, but a great job of creating martial law and a great job of getting more funding, quote, by falling down the job on purpose.
[01:56:35.514 --> 01:56:37.435]  Now they don't want any photos of the dead.
[01:56:37.975 --> 01:56:44.598]  It's like on 9-11, don't show any photos of the steel that they'd blown up with a controlled demolition.
[01:56:44.718 --> 01:56:46.859]  FEMA censors photos of the dead.
[01:56:47.532 --> 01:56:47.832]  When U.S.
[01:56:48.253 --> 01:56:58.019]  officials asked the media not to take pictures of those killed by Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath, they were censoring a key part of the disaster story Free Speech Watchdog said.
[01:56:59.099 --> 01:57:06.424]  The move by the Federal Emergency Management Agency is in line with the Bush Administration's ban on images of flag-draped coffins returning from Iraq War.
[01:57:07.558 --> 01:57:20.545]  It's impossible for me to imagine how you report a story whose subject is death without allowing the public to see the images of the subject of the story, said Larry Sims of the PEN America Center, an author's group that defends free expression.
[01:57:20.565 --> 01:57:21.685]  We're going to get him on.
[01:57:22.145 --> 01:57:25.427]  Well, yeah, I mean, that is censorship, folks.
[01:57:25.727 --> 01:57:28.288]  The government going in and saying, you can't report this.
[01:57:29.129 --> 01:57:31.410]  We'll be right back with the third Alex.
[01:57:33.211 --> 01:57:38.098]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[01:57:49.810 --> 01:57:50.470]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.111 --> 01:57:52.191]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.892 --> 01:57:54.092]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.632 --> 01:57:55.473]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.213 --> 01:57:57.114]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.134 --> 01:58:01.376]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.956 --> 01:58:06.098]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.339 --> 01:58:08.899]  We gotta get motivated.
[01:58:08.939 --> 01:58:09.880]  We gotta get angry.
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:10.940]  We gotta get focused.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:12.181]  We gotta clear our minds.
[01:58:13.132 --> 01:58:21.595]  And realize the globalists are using terrorism, using manufactured crises, natural disasters, you name it, to sell us on total control.
[01:58:21.935 --> 01:58:24.336]  We've caught them red-handed yet again.
[01:58:24.356 --> 01:58:27.797]  And it's bipartisan corruption at the federal level.
[01:58:28.397 --> 01:58:30.218]  The locals actually did a pretty good job.
[01:58:30.278 --> 01:58:33.319]  We've now learned why the police stood down.
[01:58:33.939 --> 01:58:36.520]  Because the FEMA was jamming their communications.
[01:58:37.674 --> 01:58:43.315]  So I said, look at how bad the cops are, look at how pathetic they are, 70% walking off the job.
[01:58:43.335 --> 01:58:45.076]  I was wrong.
[01:58:45.396 --> 01:58:46.236]  I apologize.
[01:58:46.356 --> 01:58:48.197]  The feds jammed their communications.
[01:58:49.177 --> 01:58:55.158]  That's why 30% had to stay behind and try to communicate with each other in private, you know, in face-to-face meetings.
[01:58:56.059 --> 01:59:01.660]  This is all documented, and in my zest to expose the incompetence of government,
[01:59:02.524 --> 01:59:07.727]  I said some things that weren't... Well, I was going off the mainstream media about the police that weren't accurate.
[01:59:08.327 --> 01:59:11.589]  The FEMA jammed them, but to the police, I apologize.
[01:59:13.190 --> 01:59:14.651]  FEMA is just so criminal.
[01:59:14.691 --> 01:59:16.732]  It's just there's no end to their deaths.
[01:59:17.372 --> 01:59:21.094]  We're going to be going over that, but again, on InfoWars.com.
[01:59:21.174 --> 01:59:22.875]  It's only on InfoWars.com right now.
[01:59:24.136 --> 01:59:25.256]  Get it up on Prison Planet later.
[01:59:26.177 --> 01:59:28.478]  We have the photos of the dead people.
[01:59:29.494 --> 01:59:31.195]  And you need to see the horror.
[01:59:31.235 --> 01:59:32.415]  And this is nothing.
[01:59:32.455 --> 01:59:34.055]  But, oh, we're evil for posting these.
[01:59:34.176 --> 01:59:36.036]  Why do they show dead Jews in World War II?
[01:59:36.276 --> 01:59:38.097]  Why do they show our dead soldiers in World War II?
[01:59:38.357 --> 01:59:41.338]  Why do they show dead Japanese with the A-bombs dropped on them?
[01:59:41.678 --> 01:59:44.599]  Why do they show the dead from the Civil War?
[01:59:45.019 --> 01:59:46.559]  Gruesome up-close photos.
[01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:48.820]  No, no.
[01:59:48.860 --> 01:59:53.362]  They selectively tell you what to see and what not to see to make the government look good.
[01:59:53.682 --> 01:59:56.302]  They've gotten the propaganda they need now to get more funding.
[01:59:56.543 --> 01:59:57.703]  They don't need to look any worse.
[01:59:59.787 --> 02:00:06.092]  And so go to InfoWars.com, get that article with those photos, email it out to everybody.
[02:00:07.253 --> 02:00:19.802]  Get our article about FEMA deliberately sabotaging the levees and deliberately sabotaging the communications lines and the firefighters and the police and jamming the police.
[02:00:20.163 --> 02:00:22.764]  Get those articles and get them out to everybody.
[02:00:22.905 --> 02:00:25.867]  I cannot stress how important these are.
[02:00:26.801 --> 02:00:29.302]  So many patriots are missing the boat.
[02:00:29.322 --> 02:00:30.743]  They're not even talking about this.
[02:00:31.363 --> 02:00:38.986]  They're so busy talking about weather modification and jabbering a hundred miles an hour, I guess like I am, but about other issues.
[02:00:39.947 --> 02:00:42.968]  The key is we've got them red-handed
[02:00:44.682 --> 02:00:46.883]  The evidence is blowing the levees, but again, that's only 98%.
[02:00:47.803 --> 02:00:55.366]  We got them 100% jamming police communications lines, blocking firefighters in the water, shooting at cops.
[02:00:55.806 --> 02:01:00.848]  We got them red-handed jamming and cutting communications.
[02:01:00.908 --> 02:01:02.909]  We got them red-handed blocking the water.
[02:01:03.349 --> 02:01:05.290]  We got them red-handed!
[02:01:07.231 --> 02:01:08.491]  Red-handed!
[02:01:09.271 --> 02:01:12.032]  We caught the cat with the canary in its mouth!
[02:01:12.873 --> 02:01:13.293]  Eating it!
[02:01:14.887 --> 02:01:15.947]  It's not an accident!
[02:01:17.708 --> 02:01:21.529]  So please, please get those reports we put out in the last three days.
[02:01:21.629 --> 02:01:22.670]  Get them out to people.
[02:01:23.030 --> 02:01:29.572]  When you, the listeners, move, when you send the emails out, when you post on the message boards, it is unstoppable!
[02:01:32.593 --> 02:01:34.474]  You know, they lost all the traction they had.
[02:01:34.494 --> 02:01:37.855]  They were getting approval rating boosts out of the London bombings they carried out the government.
[02:01:38.487 --> 02:01:42.269]  And then when we exposed it, it was MI6 behind it, and we exposed the drills and all that.
[02:01:42.770 --> 02:01:44.691]  That became one of the biggest stories on the web.
[02:01:45.051 --> 02:01:48.173]  And they dropped that story like a hot potato and quit using it.
[02:01:49.654 --> 02:01:51.115]  Quit using it to get a police state.
[02:01:51.915 --> 02:01:53.576]  I mean, we're actually contending with them.
[02:01:53.596 --> 02:01:55.898]  We're actually in the ring, holding our own.
[02:01:55.938 --> 02:02:04.923]  But we've got to gut up, and supercharge, and get fired up, and get our second wind, and just go full bore against them.
[02:02:06.485 --> 02:02:17.434]  Another article we're working on that should have been up last night and should be up today is all these mainstream news articles I've got about the criminal records of a bunch of these FEMA employees and FEMA knowingly hiring vicious felons.
[02:02:17.795 --> 02:02:19.616]  That is a very important part of this puzzle.
[02:02:19.976 --> 02:02:23.479]  If you wondered how FEMA could do all this criminal stuff, they're criminals!
[02:02:24.400 --> 02:02:25.481]  They're criminals!
[02:02:26.462 --> 02:02:27.363]  Criminals!
[02:02:27.443 --> 02:02:34.569]  Not all of them, but the key compartmentalized cadres, or special units.
[02:02:35.532 --> 02:02:41.503]  We'll get into Mexican troops coming into Texas and Louisiana and a lot more on the other side of this quick break.
[02:02:41.564 --> 02:02:43.147]  Massive news book straight ahead.
[02:02:45.382 --> 02:02:46.884]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.064 --> 02:02:50.167]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.307 --> 02:02:54.210]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.250 --> 02:02:58.474]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[02:02:58.835 --> 02:03:02.598]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.739 --> 02:03:04.600]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:04.620 --> 02:03:08.064]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:03:08.104 --> 02:03:09.185]  The medical bills!
[02:03:10.866 --> 02:03:12.807]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:12.947 --> 02:03:15.988]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:03:16.168 --> 02:03:19.050]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.530 --> 02:03:25.633]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.173 --> 02:03:29.977]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[02:03:44.751 --> 02:03:48.213]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[02:03:48.493 --> 02:03:51.995]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[02:03:52.075 --> 02:03:56.017]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[02:03:56.237 --> 02:04:02.401]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:04:02.821 --> 02:04:10.725]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[02:04:11.125 --> 02:04:16.491]  Black Berkey Filter Elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[02:04:16.631 --> 02:04:20.415]  Yet the Black Berkey Filter Elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:20.775 --> 02:04:22.617]  And the Black Berkey Filters are reclaimable.
[02:04:22.697 --> 02:04:24.859]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.

[02:04:35.509 --> 02:04:50.340]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo is coming to Mystic Lake Casino Hotel September 19th and 20th.

[02:05:16.960 --> 02:05:20.663]  The 5th Annual Seniors Expo celebrates all that's good about getting older.
[02:05:20.963 --> 02:05:23.805]  It's all happening at Mystic Lake Casino Hotel, September 19th and 20th.

[02:05:38.951 --> 02:05:42.072]  Save the date September 19th and 20th at Mystic Lake.
[02:05:46.528 --> 02:05:52.551]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.171 --> 02:05:56.213]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.454 --> 02:06:14.382]  Alright, let me get into some more of the news, and then we'll go to Esker, and Eric, and Joe, and Don, and David, and others, and Daryl.
[02:06:16.195 --> 02:06:20.759]  We've got about 51 and a half minutes left in this worldwide broadcast.
[02:06:21.520 --> 02:06:24.242]  So we have FEMA censoring the photos of the dead people.
[02:06:24.382 --> 02:06:26.284]  All other photos of dead are just fine.
[02:06:27.365 --> 02:06:38.635]  But don't show the photos of people, a lot of who died, because FEMA blocked all the aid from coming in because they wanted riots to start so they could have martial law control.
[02:06:39.876 --> 02:06:40.637]  FEMA made $1,000
[02:06:42.990 --> 02:06:48.092]  Firefighters take sexual harassment class while New Orleans drowned.
[02:06:48.612 --> 02:06:56.755]  Salt Lake City Tribune, not long after some 1,000 firefighters sat down for eight hours of training, the whispering began.
[02:06:56.995 --> 02:06:58.535]  What are we doing here?
[02:06:59.095 --> 02:07:06.498]  As New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin pleaded on national television for firefighters as the building burned, as buildings burned,
[02:07:08.050 --> 02:07:11.515]  His own are exhausted after working around the clock for a week.
[02:07:11.615 --> 02:07:18.725]  A battalion of highly trained men and women sat idle Sunday in a muggy Sheraton Hotel conference room in Atlanta.
[02:07:20.419 --> 02:07:28.807]  Many of the firefighters assembled from Utah and throughout the United States by the Federal Emergency Management Agency thought they were going to be deployed as emergency workers.
[02:07:28.867 --> 02:07:39.937]  Instead, they have learned that they are going to be community relations officers for FEMA, shuffled throughout the Gulf Coast region to disseminate flyers and a phone number.
[02:07:40.566 --> 02:07:42.488]  So again, it's all just propaganda.
[02:07:42.548 --> 02:07:44.930]  FEMA does not render aid, folks.
[02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:48.232]  FEMA is there to make sure things break down.
[02:07:48.733 --> 02:07:54.338]  And so when all these people try to volunteer, they just keep absorbing them for petty operations.
[02:07:55.138 --> 02:07:58.121]  Things that won't, you know, I mean, the Coast Guard goes, we got fuel.
[02:07:58.721 --> 02:07:59.322]  No, we don't want it.
[02:07:59.342 --> 02:08:00.343]  We got food right now.
[02:08:00.363 --> 02:08:00.963]  We want to bring it in.
[02:08:01.443 --> 02:08:02.624]  No, we're going to wait five days.
[02:08:04.162 --> 02:08:15.111]  On Monday, some firefighters, stuck in the staging area at Sheraton, peeled off their FEMA-issued shirts and stuffed them in backpacks, saying they refused to represent the federal agency.
[02:08:16.252 --> 02:08:27.020]  Meanwhile, all over Louisiana, three parishes we know of, the sheriffs are guarding key infrastructure from FEMA, who has been caught in the dead of night sabotaging communications.
[02:08:27.761 --> 02:08:29.422]  Federal officials are unapologetic!
[02:08:30.006 --> 02:08:31.468]  It's like Bush says, hey, what problem?
[02:08:31.488 --> 02:08:32.049]  There's no problem.
[02:08:32.449 --> 02:08:40.520]  I would go back and ask the firefighters to revisit his commitment to FEMA, to firefighting, and to the citizens of this country.
[02:08:42.082 --> 02:08:44.726]  And FEMA spokeswoman Mary Hudick said,
[02:08:45.882 --> 02:08:52.824]  It goes on, the firefighters, or at least the fire chiefs who assigned them to come to Atlanta, knew what the assignment would be, Udick said.
[02:08:53.304 --> 02:09:00.306]  The initial call to action very specifically says we're looking for two persons, fire teams, to do community relations.
[02:09:00.446 --> 02:09:02.967]  Yeah, not to fight fires while the city was burning.
[02:09:03.587 --> 02:09:08.048]  She said, so if there is a breakdown in communication, it was likely in their own departments.
[02:09:09.301 --> 02:09:22.732]  One fire chief from Texas agreed that he calls was clear to work as a community relations officer, but he wonders why the 1,400 firefighters FEMA attracted to Atlanta weren't being put to better use.
[02:09:23.192 --> 02:09:24.613]  He also questions why the U.S.
[02:09:24.653 --> 02:09:28.837]  Department of Homeland Security, which FEMA is a part, has not responded better to the disaster.
[02:09:30.138 --> 02:09:31.679]  It's meant to break down.
[02:09:31.779 --> 02:09:33.280]  It's meant to go bad.
[02:09:33.560 --> 02:09:36.623]  When police try to go in and fix levees,
[02:09:37.384 --> 02:09:49.848]  With the National Guard, and they were coordinating, FEMA would run around turning them back, screaming at them, telling them to stop, and then busily, in front of everyone, going around jamming the communications.
[02:09:50.388 --> 02:09:52.869]  Again, how much more obvious does this have to get?
[02:09:53.658 --> 02:09:59.464]  The firefighters, several of whom are from Utah, were told to bring backpacks, sleeping bags, first aid kits, and meals ready to eat.
[02:09:59.744 --> 02:10:02.848]  They were told to prepare for austere conditions.
[02:10:02.928 --> 02:10:09.214]  Many of them came with awkward fire gear and expected to wade the floodwaters, sift through rubble, and save lives.
[02:10:09.595 --> 02:10:12.578]  Instead, they're being taught how to not sexually harass.
[02:10:13.320 --> 02:10:20.722]  Meanwhile, the hardcore criminals of FEMA, the real FEMA employees, many of which have serious felony records, are running around.
[02:10:20.822 --> 02:10:25.383]  I mean, we've got multiple reports every day of, they go, you want a ride, baby?
[02:10:25.403 --> 02:10:26.504]  You're going to give me something.
[02:10:26.524 --> 02:10:35.306]  I mean, this was even in front of reporters who were with, there were multiple reporters with Sean Penn.
[02:10:35.806 --> 02:10:42.308]  And there's women stuck on a building, and the cops are, the FEMA cops are busy laughing, taking pictures of Sean Penn.
[02:10:43.132 --> 02:10:49.415]  And right in front of reporters, and in front of reporters, folks, going, hey baby, show me what you got!
[02:10:49.735 --> 02:11:01.900]  See, it's a big joke, you got all these real serious firemen, and real serious cops trying to volunteer, and real serious military people, and they're all lined up wanting to help, and sorry, our boys are having a good time right now.
[02:11:04.020 --> 02:11:06.101]  I mean, that's how bad this is, folks.
[02:11:06.782 --> 02:11:09.143]  So, just one of literally 50 articles.
[02:11:10.163 --> 02:11:12.684]  White House, Mrs. Bush's comment was personal.
[02:11:13.576 --> 02:11:14.377]  Associated Press.
[02:11:14.437 --> 02:11:23.462]  Barbara Bush was making a personal observation when she said poor people at a relocation center in Houston were faring better than before Hurricane Katrina struck.
[02:11:24.343 --> 02:11:31.788]  President Bush's spokesman said Wednesday, Scott McClellan, whose father was LBJ's lawyer and says LBJ told him he killed Kennedy.
[02:11:31.988 --> 02:11:32.788]  Oh, but let's ignore that.
[02:11:33.088 --> 02:11:38.392]  Scott McClellan, the White House Press Secretary, did not answer directly when asked if the President agreed with his mother's remarks.
[02:11:39.065 --> 02:11:48.089]  Mrs. Bush, after touring the Astrodome Complex in Houston on Monday, said, What I'm hearing, what is sort of scary, is that all want to stay in Texas.
[02:11:48.649 --> 02:11:58.333]  Everyone is so overwhelmed by the hospitality, and so many of the people in the arena here, you know, are underprivileged anyway, so this is working very well for them.
[02:11:58.674 --> 02:12:03.756]  She commented during a radio interview with the American Public Media Program Marketplace.
[02:12:04.508 --> 02:12:08.050]  And then off camera she said even more about how they're dysfunctional.
[02:12:08.331 --> 02:12:10.712]  Notice how the media just ignores that comment.
[02:12:12.713 --> 02:12:20.378]  McClellan at the White House briefing said, I think she was making a personal observation of some of the comments that people were making that she was running into.
[02:12:20.398 --> 02:12:25.442]  And I'm going to be honest folks, this is nothing compared to her going, I don't care about the dead trips.
[02:12:25.482 --> 02:12:30.705]  She actually said, I don't care about that, don't think about that, why should I bother my beautiful mind with body bags?
[02:12:31.719 --> 02:12:36.523]  I mean, frankly, folks, people I know have been saying, hey, these folks are happier than they were in Louisiana.
[02:12:36.803 --> 02:12:38.765]  Our local news is saying that, because they are!
[02:12:39.625 --> 02:12:40.826]  And they like Texas, folks.
[02:12:40.866 --> 02:12:41.867]  Texas hospitality.
[02:12:42.367 --> 02:12:43.708]  I mean, that really is the truth.
[02:12:44.209 --> 02:12:50.894]  I'm not defending her, but I'm defending how they, uh, you know, the fact that this is being said by people.
[02:12:51.434 --> 02:12:54.176]  But what we're focused on is helping these people who are in need.
[02:12:54.817 --> 02:13:00.341]  Askett Bush agreed with his mother, McClellan, said, I think that the observation is based on someone or some people that are
[02:13:00.976 --> 02:13:01.597]  Talking to her.
[02:13:01.617 --> 02:13:05.900]  I mean, the story here, though, is the spin.
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:08.222]  It was the comment about how these people are dysfunctional.
[02:13:08.382 --> 02:13:09.604]  That's what got in the news.
[02:13:10.024 --> 02:13:11.785]  But now they're just ignoring all of that.
[02:13:12.946 --> 02:13:14.828]  Now this is really, really important.
[02:13:15.849 --> 02:13:16.249]  Okay?
[02:13:17.530 --> 02:13:19.972]  I said over and over again, Bush wants Gonzalez.
[02:13:19.993 --> 02:13:25.377]  He put a trial balloon up a few months ago when the first Justice stepped down.
[02:13:27.639 --> 02:13:28.560]  Sandra Day O'Connor.
[02:13:29.475 --> 02:13:39.189]  Now Rehnquist dies Saturday night at his home from complications of cancer and Bush takes this deep Bush insider, Robert
[02:13:40.143 --> 02:13:44.164]  Whose record is mixed, but the most dangerous thing is he says Bush is above the law.
[02:13:44.484 --> 02:13:47.925]  He agrees that Bush is the law, which is totally unconstitutional.
[02:13:48.305 --> 02:13:52.526]  He thinks that arresting citizens without warrants and holding them secretly is good.
[02:13:52.786 --> 02:13:53.746]  We've got him there.
[02:13:54.326 --> 02:13:57.967]  He's mixed on other things, but he is nothing compared to Gonzales.
[02:13:58.127 --> 02:14:01.168]  Open member of Mecha, a Hispanic Ku Klux Klan group.
[02:14:01.668 --> 02:14:09.450]  It means... I mean, literally, the La Reconquista is very, very serious.
[02:14:11.188 --> 02:14:17.853]  But that's nothing compared to him saying Bush is above the law, but we can torture people to death, and if we don't tell them on purpose, it's not torture.
[02:14:17.873 --> 02:14:20.576]  I want to ban guns.
[02:14:20.896 --> 02:14:23.478]  I'm for more gun control than the assault weapons ban.
[02:14:23.878 --> 02:14:26.921]  I don't think 12-year-olds should ever tell their parents when they have abortions.
[02:14:28.422 --> 02:14:31.945]  By the time you hear about it in the media, Gonzales is it clear on abortion.
[02:14:32.185 --> 02:14:32.986]  What are you talking about?
[02:14:33.526 --> 02:14:37.790]  This guy is way left of Bill Clinton on the false left-right paradigm.
[02:14:39.813 --> 02:14:40.674]  And here it is!
[02:14:40.974 --> 02:14:43.796]  Gonzales is mentioned in Supreme Court remarks.
[02:14:44.856 --> 02:14:56.304]  President Bush said Tuesday that his list of candidates to replace Justice Senator O'Connor was wide open, and he jokingly, uh, pointedly singled out Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
[02:14:57.156 --> 02:15:06.445]  Mr. Bush mentioned Mr. Gonzalez as a possibility, and comments from reporters at the end of a cabinet meeting feel concern among conservatives who were already mobilizing against the Attorney General.
[02:15:06.745 --> 02:15:17.135]  Conservatives say Mr. Gonzalez has not shown himself to be sufficiently opposed to abortions, and that nominating him would miss an opportunity to move the court fundamentally to the right.
[02:15:17.873 --> 02:15:28.463]  Mr. Bush said that he had yet to make up his mind and that he would take a good long time to look at it and see who should replace Justice O'Connor.
[02:15:30.846 --> 02:15:31.646]  What does that mean?
[02:15:32.928 --> 02:15:36.191]  But he mentioned only one name, that of Mr. Gonzalez.
[02:15:37.157 --> 02:15:39.559]  So now they're doing a bait-and-switch.
[02:15:39.599 --> 02:15:47.767]  It was going to be Roberts for O'Connor, but then Rehnquist dies, so now he's switching it to Gonzalez for O'Connor, who was his first choice.
[02:15:49.048 --> 02:15:57.175]  He mentioned only one name out of Mr. Gonzalez, a longtime friend and aide who, if nominated and confirmed, would be the first Hispanic on the court.
[02:15:58.152 --> 02:15:59.533]  Get ready for the betrayal.
[02:15:59.573 --> 02:16:00.894]  Get ready for Gonzales.
[02:16:01.334 --> 02:16:03.555]  It won't matter if he says Bush is above the law.
[02:16:03.815 --> 02:16:06.817]  It won't matter if he's for arresting American citizens and torturing them.
[02:16:07.097 --> 02:16:10.399]  It won't matter if he's a member of a group that openly calls for killing white people.
[02:16:10.839 --> 02:16:11.560]  It won't matter.
[02:16:12.720 --> 02:16:15.682]  Again, folks, I don't care if they make the whole court Hispanic.
[02:16:15.722 --> 02:16:20.105]  Just make them pro-Second Amendment, pro-America, anti-abortion, pro-border.
[02:16:21.165 --> 02:16:25.448]  Gonzales is... The guy is like Ted Kennedy, but worse.
[02:16:27.276 --> 02:16:32.200]  Ted Kennedy has never said the President is above the law, and that torturing people to death is okay.
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:34.182]  I mean, folks, these are the actual memos.
[02:16:34.442 --> 02:16:37.304]  This guy is an actual Nazi pig monster.
[02:16:38.325 --> 02:16:42.168]  And you're going to have the left, I heard NPR yesterday, worshipping Gonzales.
[02:16:42.729 --> 02:16:44.030]  See, how obvious is this?
[02:16:44.790 --> 02:16:46.872]  The New York Times says Saddam's got nukes.
[02:16:47.933 --> 02:16:51.416]  You know, the New York Times, the Washington Post says Bush increased funding for the levies.
[02:16:51.696 --> 02:16:52.437]  Total lie.
[02:16:53.057 --> 02:16:54.999]  NPR says Gonzales is good.
[02:16:56.667 --> 02:16:59.408]  I mean, how much of this do we... And you know what?
[02:16:59.428 --> 02:17:03.030]  When they put Gonzales in, all the neocons will suddenly say he's conservative.
[02:17:03.330 --> 02:17:03.791]  You watch.
[02:17:04.071 --> 02:17:06.472]  They'll suddenly say, well, no, he's good.
[02:17:06.592 --> 02:17:07.573]  Shut up, liberals.
[02:17:08.553 --> 02:17:13.355]  Uh, you know, I mean, it's just... Alberto Gonzales!
[02:17:13.395 --> 02:17:16.177]  We wrote a big article exposing him on PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:17:16.217 --> 02:17:18.298]  I hope you'll go pull that article and get it out to people.
[02:17:19.659 --> 02:17:22.160]  Bush, it's the only name he's mentioned is Gonzales.
[02:17:23.921 --> 02:17:26.222]  Alberto, I love torture Gonzales.
[02:17:27.313 --> 02:17:34.303]  And you know, he can...Alberto, Josef Mingola, Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong, Gonzalez.
[02:17:36.386 --> 02:17:41.934]  Alberto, the terrible... Just unbelievable.
[02:17:42.014 --> 02:17:42.755]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:46.195 --> 02:17:50.437]  Janet from JLS Research has been preparing a revolutionary new product.

[02:17:58.960 --> 02:18:02.662]  Lotion bars are simply a lotion made into a solid bar rather than a liquid.

[02:18:47.515 --> 02:18:51.637]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:18:51.777 --> 02:18:54.659]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:18:54.719 --> 02:19:01.402]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:19:01.502 --> 02:19:01.562]  Yes.
[02:19:01.622 --> 02:19:04.605]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:19:04.826 --> 02:19:07.208]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:19:07.368 --> 02:19:17.499]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as actazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[02:19:17.679 --> 02:19:26.824]  MTBE, Radon 222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[02:19:26.984 --> 02:19:33.788]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a 2-pack of black murky purification elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:19:58.267 --> 02:19:58.667]  coins.

[02:20:46.863 --> 02:20:49.286]  People in Asia have enjoyed it for thousands of years.
[02:20:49.526 --> 02:20:52.329]  Gourmet Magazine calls it the world's most seductive fruit.
[02:20:52.670 --> 02:20:56.694]  It's the exotic mangosteen, heavenly delicious and packed with nutritional benefits.
[02:20:56.934 --> 02:21:06.245]  From the rainforest of Southeast Asia, the small beautiful mangosteen earns its nickname Queen of Fruit, with a taste that is indescribably blissful and health benefits that are off the charts.
[02:21:06.525 --> 02:21:11.446]  Because Zango is made from the whole mangosteen fruit, it delivers a serious nutrient-packed punch.
[02:21:11.706 --> 02:21:15.667]  Loaded with xanthomes, which are some of the most powerful antioxidants ever found.
[02:21:15.807 --> 02:21:23.689]  Fighting hard to support microbiological balance, maintain immune system health, promote joint flexibility, and provide positive mental support and so much more.
[02:21:23.909 --> 02:21:29.931]  Now you can experience the whole fruit goodness of the mangosteen with Zango, the original mangosteen functional health beverage.

[02:21:36.015 --> 02:21:40.659]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:59.344 --> 02:22:02.566]  I'm just going to have this guest up for 5-10 minutes in the next segment.
[02:22:02.987 --> 02:22:08.931]  Reporters Without Borders about the police beating up reporters and how that ties into the FEMA intimidation.
[02:22:09.831 --> 02:22:11.853]  But right now, let's start going to your calls.
[02:22:13.134 --> 02:22:14.935]  Let's talk to Esther in Missouri.
[02:22:14.995 --> 02:22:15.996]  Thanks for holding, Esther.
[02:22:16.516 --> 02:22:17.917]  Yeah, hi.
[02:22:18.257 --> 02:22:24.381]  You've already covered one of the things I wanted to talk about better than I could, and that's the firefighters down there.
[02:22:26.479 --> 02:22:43.929]  I wanted to say that I can't imagine that the hometown fire departments are very happy about putting the bill for them to go down there and shorting themselves on help to have them do nothing more than hand out flyers like a bunch of Boy Scouts.
[02:22:44.674 --> 02:22:44.954]  I think.
[02:22:44.974 --> 02:22:52.161]  Well, again, they do that, listen, all FEMA does is move in, block the police, block all the state aid agencies, let things get worse.
[02:22:52.581 --> 02:22:55.544]  This has all been done by Dasein.
[02:22:55.864 --> 02:22:56.845]  Right, I know that.
[02:22:56.885 --> 02:23:02.671]  Well, the Hometown Fire Department thought to make some noise over this.
[02:23:03.431 --> 02:23:05.794]  Well, noise is being made and FEMA just laughs.
[02:23:06.294 --> 02:23:07.135]  Good, good.
[02:23:07.714 --> 02:23:09.115]  They ought to scream loud and long.
[02:23:09.135 --> 02:23:13.560]  Well, listen, do you realize that a lot of high-level FEMA employees are convicted felons?
[02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:15.882]  I mean, the government has hired criminals.
[02:23:16.522 --> 02:23:19.345]  Yeah, I've discovered that in the last few days.
[02:23:19.485 --> 02:23:25.691]  I mean, it takes criminals to sit there and tell firefighters and police you can't help people, including your own mama.
[02:23:26.411 --> 02:23:31.054]  I can't believe, though, the head of emergency management there in New Orleans let his mother die.
[02:23:31.814 --> 02:23:39.659]  Oh, that just... FEMA wouldn't let him in for five days to get his mother, and he waited in order, he waited in line, and they let his mama die.
[02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:41.460]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:42.661]  I'm not going to let my mother die.
[02:23:43.021 --> 02:23:47.184]  The FEMA piece of trash that gets in between me and my mother is going to have a big problem.
[02:23:47.544 --> 02:23:49.525]  Right.
[02:23:49.565 --> 02:23:50.966]  You'd take them on.
[02:23:51.766 --> 02:23:55.147]  Well, I mean, that's not courage, that's just normal behavior.
[02:23:55.407 --> 02:23:56.588]  Right, absolutely.
[02:23:57.728 --> 02:24:09.271]  Another thing, with 9-11 coming on Sunday, this is the perfect time for people to get out and do something.
[02:24:09.331 --> 02:24:12.572]  Now, here in Kansas City, we're going to have a demonstration.
[02:24:12.692 --> 02:24:19.374]  It's Demand 9-11 Truth, Demand Katrina Truth, and
[02:24:22.249 --> 02:24:23.470]  Good, good.
[02:24:23.810 --> 02:24:26.752]  Is KCXL, our wonderful affiliate, promoting that?
[02:24:27.353 --> 02:24:28.794]  Well, no.
[02:24:29.034 --> 02:24:31.256]  We citizens are just doing it.
[02:24:31.336 --> 02:24:34.179]  Well, I know in the past they promoted it.
[02:24:34.979 --> 02:24:36.360]  Okay, well tell us where it's going to be.
[02:24:36.380 --> 02:24:45.348]  Okay, it will be at 2 o'clock on the plaza at the Horse Fountain, which most people know, 47th and J.C.
[02:24:45.408 --> 02:24:46.529]  Nichols Parkway.
[02:24:48.175 --> 02:24:49.316]  47th and J.C.
[02:24:49.336 --> 02:24:51.198]  Nichols Parkway at the Horse Fountain.
[02:24:51.258 --> 02:24:51.658]  At what time?
[02:24:51.718 --> 02:24:52.138]  At 2 o'clock.
[02:24:52.459 --> 02:24:53.560]  Alright, thank you for the call.
[02:24:54.280 --> 02:24:59.224]  By the way, we've got a listener who's showing Martial Law somewhere in Missouri.
[02:24:59.264 --> 02:25:00.165]  I forget the town.
[02:25:01.386 --> 02:25:02.967]  We've got a link on InfoWars.
[02:25:02.987 --> 02:25:04.669]  We actually took it down, but we're going to put it back up.
[02:25:05.309 --> 02:25:06.971]  On September 11th, he's showing it.
[02:25:07.031 --> 02:25:08.252]  And I'm not making a dime out of it.
[02:25:08.452 --> 02:25:10.454]  I'm glad that people are showing it.
[02:25:12.395 --> 02:25:15.037]  But it's going to be good.
[02:25:15.057 --> 02:25:16.398]  And he's going to show it again in a week or two.
[02:25:17.535 --> 02:25:20.157]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:25:20.777 --> 02:25:25.661]  Let's talk to Eric in Tennessee.
[02:25:25.681 --> 02:25:26.241]  You're on the air.
[02:25:26.281 --> 02:25:26.681]  Go ahead.
[02:25:27.042 --> 02:25:28.242]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[02:25:28.403 --> 02:25:28.663]  Good.
[02:25:29.163 --> 02:25:30.164]  It's great to talk with you.
[02:25:30.184 --> 02:25:34.967]  I've got a comment and I've got two, I think, very important things that I want to bring up.
[02:25:35.007 --> 02:25:45.014]  First of all, I was sitting there and I was watching the other day when they started putting the troops into New Orleans and I said, that looks like they're establishing a beachhead here in our country, doesn't it?
[02:25:45.835 --> 02:25:48.036]  Uh, it's just really amazing to watch it on TV.
[02:25:48.056 --> 02:25:51.917]  What you've been showing on your videos for years is finally happening now in real time.
[02:25:52.057 --> 02:26:02.682]  And they had to have it fall apart because then that's a demonstration of why we need troops and why we need to get rid of Posse Comitatus and why FEMA needs to run our lives.
[02:26:03.022 --> 02:26:04.082]  You're exactly right, sir.
[02:26:04.622 --> 02:26:11.645]  Uh, two things I want to bring up is first of all, uh, in Nashville, uh, this, this really got me worried.
[02:26:11.685 --> 02:26:13.326]  In Nashville on September 23rd and 25th,
[02:26:14.727 --> 02:26:17.470]  This was in the August 22nd Tennessean Newspaper.
[02:26:17.510 --> 02:26:19.471]  That's the main newspaper in Nashville.
[02:26:20.933 --> 02:26:26.538]  The Mayor's Office of Emergency Management is planning what they call an Emergency Preparedness Challenge.
[02:26:27.099 --> 02:26:29.801]  And in this event, they're looking for volunteers.
[02:26:29.841 --> 02:26:31.643]  That's why they posted this article.
[02:26:32.550 --> 02:26:42.475]  The event will include crisis drills, including situations of building collapse, terrorist attacks, and biohazards at mock crisis sites in West and North Nashville and Williamson County.
[02:26:42.535 --> 02:26:43.476]  I've been to many of these.
[02:26:43.556 --> 02:26:46.417]  Guaranteed they're going to have some of you play the part of terrorists.
[02:26:47.238 --> 02:26:49.139]  That might be good to get video of that.
[02:26:49.559 --> 02:26:51.140]  Okay, that's what I'm thinking.
[02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:59.004]  Do you know any, they've got an independent contractor, the name of it is Systems Research and Applications Corp.
[02:26:59.104 --> 02:27:00.885]  Have you ever heard of them before?
[02:27:00.905 --> 02:27:01.025]  Yes.
[02:27:01.878 --> 02:27:04.540]  Uh, I just want to give everybody in Nashville a heads up on that.
[02:27:04.620 --> 02:27:24.675]  The other thing is, I don't know if, uh, if somebody's already told you about, in the first part of August, Paula Zahn, for the whole week, Paula Zahn now on CNN, was talking about the coming, uh, police state, and it was like watching a documentary of yours with just her hosting it.
[02:27:24.736 --> 02:27:30.560]  They talked about the cars tracking you, they talked about national ID, cell phone... But I'm sure it was all good though!
[02:27:31.408 --> 02:27:32.889]  I'm sure she said it was good, right?
[02:27:33.249 --> 02:27:34.910]  Right, y'all, yeah, they... Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[02:27:35.851 --> 02:27:36.771]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.232 --> 02:27:38.833]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.773 --> 02:27:42.535]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.257 --> 02:27:48.739]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:27:49.499 --> 02:27:52.121]  Patrick Henry said, give me liberty or give me death.
[02:27:52.879 --> 02:28:09.030]  Did you know that he also forced the adoption of the Bill of Rights as a part of the Constitution of 1787 to guarantee your unalienable or unchangeable rights of freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and freedom to own a gun to protect our nation from tyranny?
[02:28:09.991 --> 02:28:15.195]  There is now an assault upon the unalienable, unchangeable rights to deprive you of them.
[02:28:16.002 --> 02:28:23.946]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[02:29:45.564 --> 02:29:52.068]  I love the new sandal styles, but before I discovered Non-X Nail Gel, I was too embarrassed about my toenails to wear them.
[02:29:52.288 --> 02:29:56.311]  If your nails look dark or discolored, now there's a solution besides hiding them.
[02:29:56.571 --> 02:29:58.712]  It's a patented nail gel called Non-X.
[02:29:59.092 --> 02:30:06.117]  All natural Non-X clears out the source of the problem, the dark or yellow material that builds up under nails called keratin debris.
[02:30:06.437 --> 02:30:09.039]  Non-X Nail Gel is absolutely amazing!
[02:30:09.299 --> 02:30:12.781]  My toenails now look clear and I'm not embarrassed to wear sandals anymore.
[02:30:13.081 --> 02:30:16.002]  Non-X nail gel removes yellowing keratin debris.
[02:30:16.282 --> 02:30:20.964]  It's podiatrist recommended and has been clinically shown to improve nail clarity.
[02:30:21.344 --> 02:30:22.845]  It's also money-back guaranteed.
[02:30:23.105 --> 02:30:28.927]  You'll find Non-X gel spelled N-O-N-Y-X in the foot care section at Rite Aid.
[02:30:29.267 --> 02:30:37.811]  Walgreens, Longs, Brooks, Duane Reade and independent pharmacies nationwide or online at drugstore.com.
[02:30:38.211 --> 02:30:43.593]  Non-X nail gel for clearer nails and feet that look great in sandals.
[02:30:54.486 --> 02:31:02.071]  We're about to be talking to Dolan Sholley, the director of Reporters Without Borders, a spokesman up in New York City.
[02:31:03.092 --> 02:31:05.453]  Honored to have them on.
[02:31:05.473 --> 02:31:15.860]  Then we'll be talking to some of the callers, Joe and Don and Paul and Mark, and that'll probably be it for the calls today after we take those four calls because I've got some more news I want to cover.
[02:31:15.880 --> 02:31:19.882]  We've got about 26 and a half minutes left here today.
[02:31:19.923 --> 02:31:21.504]  The website's rinfowars.com.
[02:31:22.541 --> 02:31:24.182]  And PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:24.582 --> 02:31:29.885]  There have been a lot of mainstream media reports of reporters getting punched in the mouth, getting assaulted.
[02:31:30.605 --> 02:31:32.606]  I mean, we're talking mainstream reporters.
[02:31:33.167 --> 02:31:40.711]  For local newspapers, the cops beat them up, they laugh at them, they take their film or their memory sticks away.
[02:31:41.531 --> 02:31:49.035]  And now FEMA's saying no photos of the dead, but we can see photos of dead people in World War II or Vietnam or from the Civil War.
[02:31:50.322 --> 02:31:53.884]  So it's just an attack on the First Amendment and an attack on reporters.
[02:31:53.905 --> 02:32:00.129]  And I've had cops all over the country tell me to turn off news cameras when I'm there with a news crew with congressional press passes.
[02:32:00.569 --> 02:32:04.572]  I mean real bona fides that will get you, you know, ten feet from the President.
[02:32:07.156 --> 02:32:14.441]  The establishment is giving police, the authorities, basically this free reign to do this, and it's very dangerous to a free society.
[02:32:14.461 --> 02:32:18.144]  For those who didn't know, the First Amendment is the backbone of a free society.
[02:32:19.225 --> 02:32:21.807]  And Dola Cholly, thank you so much for coming on with us.
[02:32:22.167 --> 02:32:23.768]  Sure, it's my pleasure.
[02:32:23.808 --> 02:32:33.776]  Tell us particularly about your position with Reporters About Borders and what the organization does, and then bring us up to speed on these frightening developments in the flood-ravaged areas.
[02:32:35.081 --> 02:32:40.944]  Reporters Without Borders is headquartered in Paris with an international base all over the world.
[02:32:41.324 --> 02:32:50.089]  What we do is we fight for press freedom issues around the globe and we are a media watchdog organization.
[02:32:50.109 --> 02:32:51.490]  Well, let's take it from the top.
[02:32:51.510 --> 02:32:53.771]  What do you think of FEMA saying no photos of the dead?
[02:32:54.711 --> 02:32:58.133]  Well, the situation with FEMA is nothing new.
[02:32:59.094 --> 02:33:01.235]  That should be taken into account.
[02:33:01.535 --> 02:33:03.396]  The badgering of journalists
[02:33:04.068 --> 02:33:09.791]  Has been an ongoing process with this administration and prior administrations for a number of decades.
[02:33:10.511 --> 02:33:25.699]  And the basic premise for that is that there is a direct link with the journalists somehow instigating violence or creating more attention towards lawlessness that most people, in particular security forces, would deem threatening.
[02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:29.161]  There are several incidents in the last couple of weeks
[02:33:29.953 --> 02:33:44.761]  We have the reporters from the Canadian Toronto Star, Tim Harper, and the photographer Lucas Olynyuk, who were filming the victims who were engaging in attacks of the police with the looters.
[02:33:45.702 --> 02:33:52.946]  The police grabbed them, they took out their film, they snatched their press cards, they insulted and threatened them.
[02:33:54.004 --> 02:33:59.768]  A second incident involved Gordon Russell from the New Orleans-based Times, PK Yoon, Daily.
[02:33:59.788 --> 02:34:08.332]  He was covering a shootout between police and local residents near the convention center where the victims were waiting for evacuation.
[02:34:08.693 --> 02:34:11.094]  Obviously, there was a very tense environment.
[02:34:11.713 --> 02:34:16.016]  But the police detained Russell and smashed all of his equipment on the ground.
[02:34:16.436 --> 02:34:20.980]  Well, at WACO, they had called the media to cover it, the BATFN.
[02:34:21.420 --> 02:34:25.763]  But after it went bad, we've got video of them just beating the reporters up for pleasure.
[02:34:26.183 --> 02:34:35.650]  It's almost like they throw fits and do this, but... and then they always have an excuse, well, it was a critical situation and we're self-enforcing, you know, because they're blowing our security.
[02:34:35.950 --> 02:34:41.114]  We've had the Pentagon say they're going to kill reporters on the eve of the Iraq War if they, quote, got in the way, and we've now seen
[02:34:41.554 --> 02:34:46.678]  More reporters killed in Iraq than in any other conflict in modern history.
[02:34:46.698 --> 02:34:51.461]  We're talking to Tala Dola Challah, and she is the New York representative for Reporters Without Borders.
[02:34:51.981 --> 02:34:52.702]  Please continue.
[02:34:54.042 --> 02:34:58.205]  Well, basically I agree with you in terms of what's happening in Iraq.
[02:34:58.245 --> 02:35:02.228]  The bodies that are being sent back from Iraq are also not allowed to be photographed.
[02:35:02.288 --> 02:35:05.150]  So again, this incident with FEMA is nothing new in terms of
[02:35:05.600 --> 02:35:11.285]  Well, I agree with you Alex, I think that in terms of the types of coverage that U.S.
[02:35:11.325 --> 02:35:12.546]  media have generally covered,
[02:35:26.616 --> 02:35:32.978]  The bloody wrath of the war is generally something that's covered abroad more extensively than it is in America.
[02:35:33.118 --> 02:35:34.199]  Well, here's a microcosm.
[02:35:34.239 --> 02:35:42.901]  I go to the RNC with Congressional press passes, maximum press passes, even to get backstage to get right down ten feet from the President when he gave his speech.
[02:35:43.281 --> 02:35:49.103]  But I'm at Ground Zero interviewing little old ladies and cops run over and threaten to arrest me if I don't leave.
[02:35:49.343 --> 02:35:50.764]  Then I watch them arrest
[02:35:51.484 --> 02:35:56.505]  A American spectator, conservative reporter, I mean, what is this new mentality?
[02:35:56.545 --> 02:36:05.687]  Because I've never seen this in my 11 years, and I didn't long, but I've never seen this new mentality as if some memo has gone out to treat us like trash.
[02:36:06.627 --> 02:36:19.009]  Well, I believe that there are direct links to post-September 11th security crackdowns based solely with the idea, the idea that it's terrorism, but it's been taken to an extreme.
[02:36:19.668 --> 02:36:24.271]  The turnover in terms of FEMA's administration is one clear indication.
[02:36:24.731 --> 02:36:29.634]  FEMA used to have the policy of working directly primarily in natural disasters.
[02:36:30.074 --> 02:36:47.425]  Now natural disasters is just a branch off of what FEMA is doing under the national security policy guidelines, which makes it very difficult for FEMA in terms of focusing specifically on national disasters as it did so well during the Clinton administration.
[02:36:47.984 --> 02:37:01.893]  But since this post-September 11th, the Patriot Act, swiftly adopted by Congress, monitoring information, clamping down on information, journalists are that thread to and direct link to civil society.
[02:37:02.344 --> 02:37:03.965]  Which makes them very threatening.
[02:37:04.185 --> 02:37:05.706]  Now we do have the embeds.
[02:37:05.786 --> 02:37:27.357]  We have the Army Times with the regular Army calling people combatants, calling them the resistance, calling... I've even heard the term terrorist used, but one article in the Army Times was calling them the insurgency, when really it was a small group from the reports we got that was actually, you know, actually looting and causing problems.
[02:37:27.658 --> 02:37:28.498]  So we almost see a...
[02:37:30.539 --> 02:37:31.660]  A bloodlust here.
[02:37:32.060 --> 02:37:33.001]  It's very scary.
[02:37:33.762 --> 02:37:39.445]  Well, it is difficult to say, especially if you haven't been on the ground, to see exactly what is happening in terms of lawlessness.
[02:37:40.486 --> 02:37:51.514]  I appreciate the fact, and I'm sure many of us do as American citizens, that there are police out there volunteering their time and also coming from different states like New York to help control the situation.
[02:37:51.894 --> 02:37:57.218]  What Reporters Without Borders does not agree with is that information during this very sensitive time
[02:37:57.919 --> 02:37:58.800]  What is FEMA?
[02:38:12.863 --> 02:38:19.008]  This seems like this whole thing is being used as a training drill to how to control information and how to control populations.
[02:38:19.048 --> 02:38:23.791]  I mean, they admit that Iraq and Afghanistan are, quote, active laboratories.
[02:38:24.491 --> 02:38:28.034]  The Defense Department has said that Camp X-Ray is a laboratory.
[02:38:28.634 --> 02:38:32.477]  And so they're testing all of this there, and I don't think they want the media covering that.
[02:38:34.122 --> 02:38:57.280]  Well, they really don't, and even though FEMA has been heavily criticized for its slow response to the devastation, it is now, their agency spokeswoman has said that it is not showing, allowing for the journals to photograph the dead, or to accompany people on rescue boats, is really in respect to the recovery of the victims, and also... Total bull!
[02:38:58.257 --> 02:39:01.179]  Well, these are the feedback that we're getting back.
[02:39:01.459 --> 02:39:03.640]  Well, I mean, look at the past.
[02:39:03.680 --> 02:39:07.742]  They love showing images of dead bodies so they can demonize some foreign group.
[02:39:08.322 --> 02:39:12.064]  I mean, they show the dead bodies of people from World War II, the Civil War.
[02:39:12.084 --> 02:39:15.286]  I mean, why suddenly can't we see dead bodies?
[02:39:18.087 --> 02:39:23.209]  Again, Alex, it's based a lot on, do we see a lot of blood of the war?
[02:39:23.329 --> 02:39:25.750]  Are we getting accurate images of what's going on in Iraq?
[02:39:25.770 --> 02:39:26.150]  No, we're not.
[02:39:26.410 --> 02:39:32.433]  Well, then, there is a clear explanation of the types of very boxed in covers that you see with Fox News.
[02:39:32.473 --> 02:39:34.974]  Well, all Americans should be terrified of this.
[02:39:35.034 --> 02:39:38.535]  I mean, the government is actively engaging in perception management.
[02:39:38.875 --> 02:39:43.037]  They are actively trying to keep you from seeing the real images of what's happened.
[02:39:43.677 --> 02:39:46.938]  And now it's not over in Iraq, 5,000, 6,000 miles away, folks.
[02:39:47.259 --> 02:39:49.059]  Now it's in the South.
[02:39:49.219 --> 02:39:51.140]  Now it's in, and next it'll be in your town.
[02:39:55.602 --> 02:39:57.943]  Can you give us the website to Reporters Without Borders?
[02:39:58.183 --> 02:40:00.824]  Sure, it's www.reporterswithoutborders.org.
[02:40:01.497 --> 02:40:03.779]  RalphSamFrank.org.
[02:40:03.999 --> 02:40:07.982]  That's www.rss.org.
[02:40:08.162 --> 02:40:10.083]  We'll get a link to that on Infowars.com.
[02:40:10.103 --> 02:40:11.404]  I mean, I've been ranting a bit here.
[02:40:11.424 --> 02:40:13.065]  I'm just upset about this.
[02:40:13.145 --> 02:40:20.090]  In just a few minutes, because I know you're busy, anything you think is important that needs to be imparted to the audience?
[02:40:20.811 --> 02:40:26.555]  Well, I think that one of the things that we should think about, Alex, is looking for alternative sources of news.
[02:40:27.636 --> 02:40:28.196]  We are not
[02:40:29.947 --> 02:40:40.053]  We're very fortunate in this country to be able to have a plethora of news that we can access through the internet, through different types of more fair types of programming.
[02:40:40.495 --> 02:40:43.577]  And it's not just about turning on Fox News and saying that's the story.
[02:40:43.637 --> 02:40:51.283]  And so audiences should really be very proactive day by day by looking for alternative sources of media to get the full and complete story.
[02:40:51.443 --> 02:40:53.205]  And supporting alternative media.
[02:40:53.305 --> 02:40:57.348]  I mean the establishment media knows that they've lost about 40% of their audience.
[02:40:57.708 --> 02:40:58.809]  They're beginning to panic.
[02:40:59.049 --> 02:40:59.670]  Do you think that
[02:41:00.623 --> 02:41:07.828]  Do you think that this is a response by the government now that they don't have just the compliant four networks trying to start cracking down on information?
[02:41:08.368 --> 02:41:11.570]  Well, there was bound to be a concave spread.
[02:41:11.590 --> 02:41:15.172]  The system was going to fall into itself, we shall say.
[02:41:16.353 --> 02:41:26.720]  Because of the extremity of the types of coverage that you see with Fox News and then with Al Jazeera, people are looking for that more medium in terms of trying to get the real story.
[02:41:27.427 --> 02:41:44.552]  And because it's such entertainment news now rather than the traditional real news, it's actually a positive effect in terms of American civil society really looking for other papers outside of the United States to get and gather information on the world.
[02:41:46.033 --> 02:41:53.355]  And not even believing those foreign outlets, it's just cross-referencing and really getting a wide variety of information.
[02:41:54.693 --> 02:41:55.493]  Yes, definitely.
[02:41:55.653 --> 02:41:56.674]  Well, that's good news.
[02:41:58.015 --> 02:42:05.198]  Now, specifically, is it the Louisiana Police smashing equipment and beating people up, or is it FEMA?
[02:42:05.458 --> 02:42:08.580]  I mean, specifically, in these instances, who is doing this?
[02:42:09.560 --> 02:42:18.264]  In the incidents with Tim Harper and his colleague from the Toronto Star in Canada, these were Louisiana-based police.
[02:42:19.065 --> 02:42:23.447]  The incident with Gordon Russell was, as well, Louisiana-based police.
[02:42:24.564 --> 02:42:30.006]  I believe that the FEMA has not directly attacked any journalist.
[02:42:30.106 --> 02:42:40.370]  They have put on very kind of strict draconian style mandates in terms of what media are allowed to do.
[02:42:40.390 --> 02:42:44.411]  Yeah, they're there at the outskirts blocking the media from getting in.
[02:42:44.571 --> 02:42:49.493]  They're not directly doing it, but there are some speculations as to whether or not
[02:42:50.317 --> 02:43:03.761]  uh... the bush administration is preventing well we know they've set the policy for the police not to let people in, I mean and clearly and and media are also banned from photographing flag-draped caskets of U.S.
[02:43:03.781 --> 02:43:15.665]  soldiers in Iraq and again this is nothing new this criticism was sparked you know over a year ago when these caskets were returning home well it's not stopping the photos of dead from getting out
[02:43:16.881 --> 02:43:23.323]  It isn't, but it is making it a bit more difficult for journalists, especially if they are the ones being attacked, and we have to remember that.
[02:43:23.343 --> 02:43:28.004]  Well, we've got a photo right now on InfoWars.com of a dog eating a dead body.
[02:43:30.645 --> 02:43:31.445]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:43:33.285 --> 02:43:35.826]  Oh, I was waiting for you.
[02:43:36.086 --> 02:43:37.546]  You were taken aback by that statement?
[02:43:37.826 --> 02:43:42.848]  No, I mean, there are photos in the foreign press of things like dogs eating dead bodies.
[02:43:42.908 --> 02:43:43.688]  I was just going to say that.
[02:43:45.140 --> 02:43:49.522]  Well, obviously journalists are out there and obviously they're doing a remarkable job.
[02:43:49.902 --> 02:43:55.265]  It's actually a real breath of fresh air to see this kind of journalism happening.
[02:43:55.845 --> 02:44:03.408]  I think as a journalist many of us have been very kind of disappointed as you have with the types of coverage that we've been seeing in recent months.
[02:44:03.468 --> 02:44:13.153]  It's been very boxed in, it's been very below mainstream and now journalists are really taking a step forward and getting the real story
[02:44:13.658 --> 02:44:27.064]  And that's a real problem, clearly due to the lack of coordination by FEMA, who is being heavily criticized, the Bush administration really wanting to uphold the populace in terms of popular vote.
[02:44:28.184 --> 02:44:34.668]  This incident really could be the cornerstone for complete disapproval of this administration.
[02:44:34.688 --> 02:44:36.530]  No, I agree with you.
[02:44:36.550 --> 02:44:38.171]  That's why they're desperately trying to control it.
[02:44:38.571 --> 02:44:46.656]  It was an interesting thing that I was hearing this woman, this African-American woman say, we are not refugees, we are American citizens.
[02:44:46.736 --> 02:44:54.581]  I mean, I think that phrase alone really hits home hard, that these images that we're seeing are of Americans.
[02:44:54.601 --> 02:44:54.981]  Well, that's right.
[02:44:56.405 --> 02:44:58.486]  Typically, that means from one country to another.
[02:44:59.046 --> 02:45:02.227]  Refugees is from movement from one country to another.
[02:45:02.327 --> 02:45:04.208]  I mean, clearly they afraid... That's right.
[02:45:04.228 --> 02:45:05.469]  I mean, I haven't made that point.
[02:45:05.549 --> 02:45:07.449]  Refugee means from one country to another.
[02:45:07.529 --> 02:45:08.970]  It's saying outsiders.
[02:45:09.350 --> 02:45:10.671]  These are American citizens.
[02:45:10.711 --> 02:45:12.311]  That term is incorrect.
[02:45:12.391 --> 02:45:12.731]  All right.
[02:45:12.751 --> 02:45:16.193]  Well, I appreciate you coming on with us, Paula Dalachala.
[02:45:16.773 --> 02:45:19.534]  And I really appreciate what Reporters Without Borders is doing.
[02:45:19.574 --> 02:45:20.054]  And take care.
[02:45:20.294 --> 02:45:20.614]  Thank you.
[02:45:20.634 --> 02:45:20.934]  Bye-bye.
[02:45:21.074 --> 02:45:21.415]  You bet.
[02:45:21.435 --> 02:45:21.855]  Bye-bye.
[02:45:23.189 --> 02:45:26.552]  Seriously, folks, we weren't going to post the photos of the dead bodies.
[02:45:26.612 --> 02:45:29.114]  I mean, a hundred other websites are doing it, too.
[02:45:29.514 --> 02:45:32.016]  Foreign newspapers are posting them.
[02:45:32.036 --> 02:45:33.237]  We weren't going to post them.
[02:45:34.157 --> 02:45:37.640]  I mean, that's not particularly something that we're into, macabre images.
[02:45:38.721 --> 02:45:51.691]  But because the government's trying to block your access to that, because FEMA has no right to say that, to tell the press, you know, don't show these images, when they show these images, again, this is total double-think, folks.
[02:45:52.313 --> 02:45:54.774]  This is total, mindless, double-think.
[02:45:54.794 --> 02:45:57.975]  It's like when they tried to say, don't show the beheading on TV.
[02:45:59.556 --> 02:46:02.217]  I mean, people have a right to see that if they want to see it.
[02:46:03.197 --> 02:46:05.098]  Now, we weren't going to put it all on our website.
[02:46:06.019 --> 02:46:09.360]  But if people wanted the access to it, I think you'll find it somewhere else.
[02:46:09.400 --> 02:46:12.701]  But because there's this attempt, we've written an article about it.
[02:46:12.721 --> 02:46:16.723]  We put it on InfoWars.com.
[02:46:17.783 --> 02:46:19.644]  Let's go ahead and take a few calls here.
[02:46:20.208 --> 02:46:24.471]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Let's go to Don in Indiana first.
[02:46:24.631 --> 02:46:26.012]  Don in Indiana, you're on the air.
[02:46:26.032 --> 02:46:26.672]  Go ahead, Don.
[02:46:28.413 --> 02:46:28.913]  Hi, Alex.
[02:46:28.933 --> 02:46:29.714]  Hi, Don.
[02:46:30.755 --> 02:46:40.921]  Listen, I just want to say I got a good friend that has relatives in New Orleans and they told him just before that levees broke they were hearing explosions.
[02:46:40.941 --> 02:46:43.863]  They just want to say that.
[02:46:43.883 --> 02:46:49.006]  Well, we do have the Toronto Globe and Mail reporting that and many others, sir.
[02:46:49.818 --> 02:46:50.018]  Okay.
[02:46:50.218 --> 02:46:55.699]  I mean, we got FEMA cutting police communications lines and jamming communications as the storm came in.
[02:46:55.779 --> 02:46:59.120]  I mean, that's clear terrorism right there.
[02:46:59.140 --> 02:47:00.080]  Yes, it is.
[02:47:00.640 --> 02:47:02.521]  I mean, that's been mainstream news.
[02:47:02.541 --> 02:47:03.541]  I mean, what do you say to that?
[02:47:05.481 --> 02:47:09.502]  Well, about all I can say is it's nothing new, is it?
[02:47:10.322 --> 02:47:12.103]  We've seen this stuff over and over again.
[02:47:12.143 --> 02:47:13.483]  You haven't called in about a year.
[02:47:13.503 --> 02:47:15.523]  You're the retired Federal Marshal.
[02:47:15.803 --> 02:47:19.044]  What do your buddies that are still on the Federal Marshal ship, what do they say?
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:22.080]  Well, I haven't really talked to them much.
[02:47:22.180 --> 02:47:27.101]  I've talked to other police and everybody's just shaking their head.
[02:47:28.922 --> 02:47:31.542]  It's unacceptable, totally unacceptable, obviously.
[02:47:31.602 --> 02:47:32.462]  It's by design.
[02:47:32.482 --> 02:47:33.943]  It couldn't be anything else.
[02:47:33.963 --> 02:47:38.203]  Well, are your friends, your colleagues, I mean, are they saying it's by design or are they just saying unacceptable?
[02:47:38.843 --> 02:47:40.244]  Unacceptable so far.
[02:47:41.204 --> 02:47:44.004]  But, you know, I mean, sooner or later you have to face the truth about it.
[02:47:44.064 --> 02:47:46.445]  I mean, you know, they're involved in
[02:47:47.819 --> 02:47:50.080]  And that kind of work, rescue work and things like that.
[02:47:50.180 --> 02:47:54.501]  And it was pretty general across the board.
[02:47:54.541 --> 02:47:58.222]  And obviously the help was withheld intentionally.
[02:47:59.223 --> 02:48:00.723]  And the federal government withheld it.
[02:48:02.144 --> 02:48:06.885]  Right now they're going to make the mayor of New Orleans a whipping boy.
[02:48:06.905 --> 02:48:09.166]  And they're going to blame it all on him.
[02:48:13.376 --> 02:48:16.537]  With FEMA turning away help and turning away countries and everything else.
[02:48:17.118 --> 02:48:20.019]  You know, when people are dying, you immediately go rush for their aid.
[02:48:20.059 --> 02:48:21.199]  It doesn't matter who's doing it.
[02:48:21.219 --> 02:48:25.301]  Well, what about a week ago, the firefighters show up to help and they go, OK, you're not going to help.
[02:48:25.701 --> 02:48:28.823]  We've got five days of sexual harassment training for you.
[02:48:29.183 --> 02:48:29.663]  Yeah.
[02:48:30.944 --> 02:48:32.284]  Yeah.
[02:48:32.344 --> 02:48:33.685]  Anything else you want to add, Don?
[02:48:34.105 --> 02:48:36.006]  I just wanted to get on the record for that, you know.
[02:48:36.829 --> 02:48:37.630]  Good to hear from you.
[02:48:37.690 --> 02:48:39.571]  We'll take a few final calls on the other side.
[02:48:40.011 --> 02:48:45.155]  Stay with us.
[02:48:46.816 --> 02:48:49.678]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.938 --> 02:48:51.499]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.

[02:48:56.863 --> 02:49:01.306]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:01.727 --> 02:49:05.890]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:06.510 --> 02:49:08.951]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:09.051 --> 02:49:13.714]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.914 --> 02:49:18.336]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.556 --> 02:49:25.780]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:28.441]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:50:11.448 --> 02:50:17.992]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.

[02:51:22.363 --> 02:51:22.583]  I think so.
[02:51:52.176 --> 02:51:57.981]  Folks, it's been a journey for me.
[02:51:58.601 --> 02:52:04.165]  I mean, it's hard to believe how evil these criminal elements are in our government, but we know about human history.
[02:52:04.446 --> 02:52:05.667]  We know about the human psyche.
[02:52:06.547 --> 02:52:14.834]  We know that when powerful people who are evil get into control of government, things get really bad because there's nothing to hold back these evil people.
[02:52:15.794 --> 02:52:17.636]  And they cloak themselves in legitimacy.
[02:52:18.963 --> 02:52:23.965]  And they really are widening crises, carrying out terror attacks as a pretext for more control.
[02:52:24.465 --> 02:52:27.286]  You watch, at the end of the day, they're going to get more funds, more control.
[02:52:28.267 --> 02:52:31.408]  Even if we're all mad at the government, they're going to get more power out of it.
[02:52:31.428 --> 02:52:33.049]  Man, it's just atrocious.
[02:52:33.069 --> 02:52:33.989]  It's so obvious.
[02:52:34.969 --> 02:52:37.030]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:52:37.871 --> 02:52:41.072]  Let's go to Joe in California.
[02:52:41.132 --> 02:52:42.292]  I want to go to Paul and Mark.
[02:52:42.332 --> 02:52:42.933]  Go ahead, Joe.
[02:52:43.273 --> 02:52:43.613]  Hey, Alex.
[02:52:43.693 --> 02:52:44.373]  How are you doing?
[02:52:44.433 --> 02:52:45.274]  A couple of points.
[02:52:46.618 --> 02:52:47.578]  Go ahead and continue.
[02:52:47.658 --> 02:52:50.019]  Give us all that information, whatever photographs.
[02:52:50.399 --> 02:53:01.884]  You know, that was the times a year we get bombarded, and I'm not trying to be anti-Semitic here, with pictures and photographs of the victims of the concentration camps.
[02:53:03.405 --> 02:53:06.926]  And so, just as that is so important, so is this.
[02:53:07.886 --> 02:53:09.587]  FEMA is obviously a bunch of corrupt
[02:53:10.356 --> 02:53:14.321]  You know, some of them are corrupt individuals, felons, etc.
[02:53:14.401 --> 02:53:17.966]  that have been hired and they're being sent over there to try and rescue and help.
[02:53:18.527 --> 02:53:20.849]  These poor people that have actually survived somehow?
[02:53:21.329 --> 02:53:22.750]  That's just outrageous stuff.
[02:53:22.870 --> 02:53:25.232]  The fact that we'll never know what the actual body count.
[02:53:25.432 --> 02:53:26.032]  No, you're right.
[02:53:26.072 --> 02:53:29.135]  I mean, look, they show dead all the time when it suits them.
[02:53:29.435 --> 02:53:35.499]  But whenever it doesn't, and we're talking about a helicopter shot of a dead body, I mean, it's not even... I mean, it's sad.
[02:53:35.900 --> 02:53:40.623]  When you show how these people were left behind, oh no, you can't see that.
[02:53:40.683 --> 02:53:44.686]  But ooh, let's go watch a violent movie where an alien busts out of a baby's stomach.
[02:53:45.226 --> 02:53:47.428]  Yeah, when I was in school, I'm sure as you were,
[02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:55.877]  Um, you know, we received all these pictures and photographs up close, uh, shots of the victims in concentration camps.
[02:53:56.517 --> 02:54:00.120]  Uh, there's still some of the most... Yeah, eyeballs hanging out of heads, maggots.
[02:54:00.681 --> 02:54:02.082]  But don't you show this!
[02:54:02.302 --> 02:54:02.822]  Oh no!
[02:54:03.203 --> 02:54:05.084]  Listen, thanks for the call, I appreciate it.
[02:54:05.224 --> 02:54:06.345]  Absolutely, great point.
[02:54:06.866 --> 02:54:08.847]  And I'm sorry we're cutting folks short, we're just out of time.
[02:54:09.028 --> 02:54:09.868]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:54:10.028 --> 02:54:10.509]  Great points.
[02:54:10.869 --> 02:54:13.111]  Paul in Indiana, then Mark in Missouri.
[02:54:13.131 --> 02:54:13.531]  We have time.
[02:54:13.571 --> 02:54:14.052]  Go ahead, Paul.
[02:54:14.252 --> 02:54:14.672]  Hey, Alex.
[02:54:14.952 --> 02:54:15.153]  Hi.
[02:54:15.313 --> 02:54:16.674]  Uh, couple quick points.
[02:54:17.450 --> 02:54:23.132]  One, I'm sure a lot of people saw the interview with the Jefferson Parish President.
[02:54:23.772 --> 02:54:25.733]  Yes, we played that and it's also on the website.
[02:54:25.953 --> 02:54:26.153]  Okay.
[02:54:28.034 --> 02:54:29.074]  Go ahead.
[02:54:29.154 --> 02:54:41.959]  So anyway, the fact that he came out and he says that FEMA needs more funding, they need more power, blah blah blah, but they cut his emergency phone lines.
[02:54:42.748 --> 02:54:50.830]  I mean, did people not see that and, you know, just be boggled in their minds by that?
[02:54:51.450 --> 02:54:58.032]  Well, if you notice in that video, he's looking down, reading, and he finally just throws it down and tells the truth.
[02:54:58.512 --> 02:54:59.933]  They all give them scripts.
[02:55:00.433 --> 02:55:04.574]  He's reading a script, he knows it's bold, he just throws it aside and goes,
[02:55:05.521 --> 02:55:07.103]  FEMA needs to take over our lives!
[02:55:07.183 --> 02:55:07.984]  Unlimited power!
[02:55:08.004 --> 02:55:09.005]  God, he throws it down!
[02:55:09.165 --> 02:55:10.146]  FEMA's horrible!
[02:55:10.186 --> 02:55:10.547]  FEMA!
[02:55:11.047 --> 02:55:12.289]  They're cutting our lines!
[02:55:12.709 --> 02:55:20.718]  Second quick point is people still do not understand that all those people needed was water.
[02:55:21.039 --> 02:55:26.265]  You can say that the disaster was too big, we didn't have, you know, this or that.
[02:55:26.789 --> 02:55:32.213]  But there's no way for them to get around the fact that all those people needed was water to survive.
[02:55:32.393 --> 02:55:32.893]  Exactly.
[02:55:32.933 --> 02:55:33.774]  Thank you for the call.
[02:55:33.794 --> 02:55:34.434]  Alright, take care.
[02:55:34.454 --> 02:55:34.935]  Thank you.
[02:55:34.975 --> 02:55:35.976]  Let's take a final call.
[02:55:36.056 --> 02:55:37.136]  Mark, you're our tail gunner.
[02:55:37.176 --> 02:55:37.837]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:55:39.858 --> 02:55:40.559]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[02:55:40.899 --> 02:55:51.186]  Thank you for putting a link to our, uh, on your website where people in Missouri can come and see your latest documentary in Springfield, Missouri this Sunday at 7 p.m.
[02:55:51.366 --> 02:55:52.867]  Okay, what else is on your mind, sir?
[02:55:53.188 --> 02:55:56.290]  Have you heard of Sorka Fall, a Russian reporter?
[02:55:57.857 --> 02:55:58.917]  Yeah, it rings a bell.
[02:55:58.937 --> 02:56:01.658]  Well, I don't have time to get into that ad.
[02:56:01.699 --> 02:56:02.339]  No, no, go ahead.
[02:56:02.359 --> 02:56:02.639]  Tell us.
[02:56:02.699 --> 02:56:03.419]  What'd he say?
[02:56:03.859 --> 02:56:18.245]  Well, there's an ad that I just got last night talking about Russian forces preparing for massive earthquakes as the Gulf of Mexico becomes zone of death and the New Madrid Fault zone heads toward a cataclysmic event.
[02:56:18.305 --> 02:56:18.905]  Have you heard of that?
[02:56:19.625 --> 02:56:20.065]  I have.
[02:56:20.385 --> 02:56:23.347]  We'll be back tomorrow, 11 to 2, back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:23.387 --> 02:56:24.047]  God bless you all.
