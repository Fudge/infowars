[00:00:05.718 --> 00:00:06.359]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:08.080]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:09.921]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.541 --> 00:00:11.382]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.122 --> 00:00:12.983]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.003 --> 00:00:17.485]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:22.028]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:23.469]  Music
[00:00:32.586 --> 00:00:33.527]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:34.148]  until 2 p.m.
[00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:35.369]  Central Standard Time.
[00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:36.129]  We're here live.
[00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:42.255]  It is Samhain, Devil's Night, Halloween, the 31st day of October 2005 as we plunge into the dark time of the year.
[00:00:56.042 --> 00:01:06.606]  Celebrated by our European ancestors by human sacrifice and the sacrifice of animals and celebrated worldwide by ancient occultic groups with human sacrifice.
[00:01:06.946 --> 00:01:14.629]  And today we celebrate by dressing our children up as little demons and having them go out and demand things from people at their front doors.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.021]  They don't learn how to give on Halloween.
[00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:25.906]  They learn how to demand and fold ransom, blackmail, extortion, terrorism.
[00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:33.091]  And that evil communist Chavez, Hugo Chavez down in Venezuela, he's saying do not celebrate it.
[00:01:33.111 --> 00:01:33.791]  It is evil.
[00:01:34.812 --> 00:01:36.893]  An evil American export.
[00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:40.315]  And he's begging people not to dress their children up as demons.
[00:01:41.116 --> 00:01:44.258]  And he's giving state-owned property to the public and giving them deeds.
[00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.361]  Our government is saying that they'll take our property with no just compensation whenever they want.
[00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:53.764]  And the communist is saying he's going to give everybody property and we need to stop Halloween.
[00:01:55.725 --> 00:01:59.067]  I just point out how ridiculous the things that they call Chavez are.
[00:01:59.128 --> 00:02:00.608]  It's total lies, of course.
[00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:02.510]  And that's why we hear that.
[00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.573]  I'm not calling for banning Halloween, but I will tell you what it really is all about.
[00:02:08.403 --> 00:02:12.287]  Today we have professor and author Tex Marsh joining us.
[00:02:12.587 --> 00:02:13.548]  His new book is out.
[00:02:13.628 --> 00:02:14.769]  It is unbelievable.
[00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:17.352]  650-something pages long.
[00:02:17.412 --> 00:02:18.813]  It is an encyclopedia.
[00:02:19.194 --> 00:02:20.335]  It is mind-blowing.
[00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:23.438]  I will use it as a desk reference here in the future.
[00:02:24.038 --> 00:02:26.621]  It totally meshes with my research and goes even deeper.
[00:02:27.161 --> 00:02:28.583]  Codex Magicka.
[00:02:29.344 --> 00:02:30.685]  Codex Magica.
[00:02:30.765 --> 00:02:36.608]  And yes, right now it's going up on the online bookstore at InfoWars.com.
[00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:39.389]  We're going to be carrying Codex Magica.
[00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:43.911]  In fact, the books are coming from the printer early next week.
[00:02:44.472 --> 00:02:45.552]  So you can start ordering now.
[00:02:45.592 --> 00:02:47.853]  We'll be shipping them out to you by the end of next week.
[00:02:48.174 --> 00:02:50.515]  Get your Codex Magica today.
[00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:52.756]  It is a mind-blowing product.
[00:02:53.136 --> 00:03:02.502]  It's like a 600-something page reader's digest.
[00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:07.265]  It just crystallizes everything you need to know about the New World Order.
[00:03:07.285 --> 00:03:13.830]  And there's no doubt that we have an occultic empire running the entire globe when you read Codex Magica.
[00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.933]  I didn't mean to go into a frothing plug for it, but it's just unbelievable.
[00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.367]  We're going to have open phones in this first hour.
[00:03:22.427 --> 00:03:23.807]  Anything you'd like to discuss?
[00:03:24.088 --> 00:03:25.988]  The indictment of Scooter Libby.
[00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:31.210]  Turns out the judge over him is a neocon 9-11 cover-up artist.
[00:03:31.691 --> 00:03:33.431]  So it'll be totally staged, don't worry.
[00:03:33.451 --> 00:03:36.112]  9-11 cover-up judge has signed a Libby case.
[00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:39.934]  Also, Lord Bush's approval ratings plunged to all-time super lows.
[00:03:40.814 --> 00:03:48.197]  And they're talking about Fitzgerald demanding that Cheney show up to one of these meetings and be...
[00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:56.071]  Questioned by the prosecutor, so things definitely heating up there.
[00:03:56.932 --> 00:04:06.859]  And obviously Bush has his new Supreme Court nominee now that his friend, the Janet Reno type, is gone.
[00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:13.463]  Now we've got a new individual, and so we'll be getting into that as well.
[00:04:13.503 --> 00:04:16.085]  Bush nominates a lot of them.
[00:04:17.068 --> 00:04:22.432]  Two Supreme Court choice named after a week of political difficulty over Harriet Myers.
[00:04:24.133 --> 00:04:26.315]  And Bush was heckled yesterday during a speech.
[00:04:26.415 --> 00:04:27.336]  I mean, really, who cares?
[00:04:27.376 --> 00:04:27.876]  He's a puppet.
[00:04:28.296 --> 00:04:31.839]  Bush tomorrow to unveil super flu strategy.
[00:04:31.859 --> 00:04:37.203]  How martial law and the end of America will save us and how good it is.
[00:04:37.663 --> 00:04:41.306]  Bob Barr says open season on DNA may be not far away.
[00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:45.069]  Army secret services, deadly chemicals at sea.
[00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:49.052]  Ah, just thousands of tons of deadly nerve gas.
[00:04:49.092 --> 00:04:49.934]  It's good for you.
[00:04:49.954 --> 00:04:52.137]  It's no big deal if it kills the ocean.
[00:04:52.157 --> 00:04:53.620]  The government loves you.
[00:04:54.561 --> 00:04:56.444]  Just trust them and give up all your freedoms.
[00:04:56.925 --> 00:04:57.686]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.706 --> 00:04:58.147]  Stay with us.
[00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:05.395]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.656 --> 00:05:07.237]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:12.263]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.604 --> 00:05:17.049]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.614]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:05:21.854 --> 00:05:22.454]  We're good to go.
[00:05:51.834 --> 00:05:55.337]  That's Infowars.com or AAA 2533139.
[00:05:55.758 --> 00:05:59.221]  Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:06:01.744 --> 00:06:10.369]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:21.856]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:06:22.077 --> 00:06:24.738]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:25.078 --> 00:06:29.181]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is over-filled
[00:06:29.381 --> 00:06:31.523]  And it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:06:31.683 --> 00:06:33.545]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:06:33.745 --> 00:06:39.771]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[00:06:40.032 --> 00:06:45.637]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:06:46.017 --> 00:06:49.939]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:49.959 --> 00:06:50.659]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:06:50.679 --> 00:06:51.380]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:02.148 --> 00:07:02.628]  We're good to go.
[00:07:02.648 --> 00:07:03.068]  We're good to go.
[00:07:23.137 --> 00:07:27.879]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:07:28.159 --> 00:07:31.941]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:07:32.201 --> 00:07:37.183]  Whatever it is you seek, Zangle could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:07:37.443 --> 00:07:39.144]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:07:39.244 --> 00:07:40.025]  We're good to go.
[00:07:40.045 --> 00:07:40.185]  I think?
[00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:06.543]  Big Brother.
[00:08:07.203 --> 00:08:08.284]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.985 --> 00:08:10.085]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.726 --> 00:08:11.567]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.307 --> 00:08:13.368]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.869 --> 00:08:17.531]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.072 --> 00:08:22.215]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.117 --> 00:08:27.980]  Well, it's Monday, and it is all St.
[00:08:29.441 --> 00:08:29.921]  Steve.
[00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:30.842]  Or Samhain.
[00:08:32.163 --> 00:08:32.864]  Devil night.
[00:08:33.284 --> 00:08:34.265]  Sacrifice night.
[00:08:34.963 --> 00:08:37.384]  We'll give you some of the history of Halloween this evening.
[00:08:39.465 --> 00:08:41.786]  And we'll also take your phone calls.
[00:08:41.826 --> 00:08:44.367]  Got TexMars coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:44.427 --> 00:08:54.151]  Then in the third hour, the Vaccine Awareness Network, they got a bill to not only congressionally pass a law for forced inoculations.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:12.445]  They already did that in the Homeland Security package, but to actually fund the federal takeover of the counties, cities, and states to set up the programs for forced inoculation, Bush is set to give a big speech tomorrow night about how wonderful martial law is and how good it is for all of us, and just let the government run things.
[00:09:12.465 --> 00:09:13.465]  They'll take good care of us.
[00:09:15.706 --> 00:09:22.508]  And there's all sorts of stuff in there about if the vaccine damages you or kills you, no liability of any type for any vaccine.
[00:09:23.231 --> 00:09:31.397]  Boy, you know rough waters are ahead when they start trying to pull stuff like that, so that's coming up 20 minutes into the third hour.
[00:09:32.337 --> 00:09:36.260]  And yes, we will have wide open phones, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:48.609]  It's being reported by several different publications, including the Drudgley Report, that prosecutor plans on calling Cheney as witness in open court.
[00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:52.692]  Executive privilege fight looms.
[00:09:54.182 --> 00:10:02.048]  Special Counsel Patrick Fitzgerald is planning to call Vice President Dick Cheney as a witness in the trial of Louis Libby.
[00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:13.898]  The Drugs Report has learned that the high-stakes move could result in an executive privilege showdown between the White House and Fitzgerald, a top government source said Sunday.
[00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.582]  If Mr. Fitzgerald is going to demand a public hearing,
[00:10:20.504 --> 00:10:30.189]  Recounting of conversations between the Vice President or even the President and his staff, his lawyer I would add, on matters he himself has acknowledged or classified.
[00:10:31.261 --> 00:10:33.643]  Executive privilege will obviously be involved.
[00:10:33.703 --> 00:10:40.388]  Fitzgerald has made it clear to lawyers involved in the case that he prefers Cheney appear as a witness in open court.
[00:10:40.889 --> 00:10:49.476]  Mr. Fitzgerald is starting from the position that this could not be done on remote or videotape, the well-placed source said.
[00:10:49.796 --> 00:10:54.860]  Remember Bill Clinton appeared for the Arkansas State Grand Jury via video.
[00:10:55.692 --> 00:10:56.712]  Via videotape.
[00:10:57.053 --> 00:11:04.355]  Fitzgerald said Libby's attorney, Joseph Tate, discussed possible plea options before the indictment was issued last week.
[00:11:04.635 --> 00:11:15.339]  Time magazine reports in new editions that the deal was scotched or vetoed because the prosecutor insisted that Libby do some serious jail time.
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.381]  Folks, this whole thing stinks to high heaven.
[00:11:20.341 --> 00:11:25.503]  I am no fan of Scooter Libby or Tom DeLay or Dick Cheney or any of these people.
[00:11:27.348 --> 00:11:34.214]  Obviously, Vic Cheney should be in jail for giving contracts directly to his wife at Lockheed Martin, Marietta.
[00:11:35.395 --> 00:11:41.120]  Obviously, they should be in jail for deals they've struck and deals they've pulled with the Carlaw Group.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.204]  We have overt criminality-breaking masses of federal laws.
[00:11:47.705 --> 00:11:48.926]  We have them red-handed.
[00:11:48.986 --> 00:11:51.188]  We have them lying to Congress.
[00:11:51.986 --> 00:11:55.007]  We have the Secretary of State lying to Congress.
[00:11:55.027 --> 00:11:57.887]  We have Bush lying to Congress in testimony.
[00:11:57.907 --> 00:11:59.068]  That's what the State of the Union is.
[00:11:59.628 --> 00:12:01.308]  We have all of this.
[00:12:02.348 --> 00:12:04.309]  We have the Forge-Nizer documents.
[00:12:04.369 --> 00:12:11.130]  We have the Downing Street memos where Blair's saying, well, I've talked to Bush and I've got to lie for him.
[00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:14.891]  We have them red-handed on just massive issues.
[00:12:15.786 --> 00:12:32.365]  Instead, and it's always this way, it's some little petty issue that can't implicate anybody else in the power structure because they couldn't go after Clinton for missile secrets or cocaine dealers or supercomputer technology because it was connected to high-ranking Republicans.
[00:12:32.645 --> 00:12:33.466]  It's the same thing here.
[00:12:34.269 --> 00:12:38.851]  They've got to go after them for some little petty issue, and I think the whole thing's staged.
[00:12:39.571 --> 00:12:40.111]  I really do.
[00:12:40.131 --> 00:12:42.452]  I mean, it's one of a couple different things.
[00:12:42.512 --> 00:13:00.039]  Either the elite is using this to somehow leverage Bush to do what they want, because Bush has gotten out of line somehow, or this is a completely contrived staged event to steam valve all the public angst and brewing revolution that's going on to deflect that off of the elite onto their puppet Bush.
[00:13:01.485 --> 00:13:09.071]  Or the elite could be deciding to use this to pressure Bush to make him resign or leave office like they did with Nixon after Nixon carried out every program they ordered him to.
[00:13:10.452 --> 00:13:13.074]  I don't know, but this Fitzgerald just stinks to high heaven.
[00:13:14.097 --> 00:13:21.985]  And then we have articles like this one from Wayne Madison who has proven to be a really accurate source in the past.
[00:13:22.386 --> 00:13:25.649]  Former NSA officer, National Security Agency.
[00:13:25.689 --> 00:13:27.391]  We need to get Wayne on the show.
[00:13:27.411 --> 00:13:33.357]  9-11 cover-up judge assigned to Libby Case.
[00:13:35.902 --> 00:13:37.524]  And there's Paul Watson's comment here.
[00:13:55.262 --> 00:13:57.584]  Has been assigned the Lewis Libby case.
[00:13:58.205 --> 00:14:07.813]  It is noteworthy to point out that Walton's past concurrent links to the Republican right and to elements in the Bush administration who have covered up important details about 9-11.
[00:14:07.833 --> 00:14:07.953]  Walton...
[00:14:10.928 --> 00:14:12.069]  Was appointed to D.C.
[00:14:12.089 --> 00:14:14.390]  Superior Court in 81 by Ronald Reagan.
[00:14:14.710 --> 00:14:16.891]  In 89, he was appointed by George H.W.
[00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:19.692]  Bush as the Deputy Drug Czar under Bill Bennett.
[00:14:20.493 --> 00:14:21.573]  Ah, Mr. Racehorse.
[00:14:22.494 --> 00:14:25.015]  Walton was reappointed to D.C.
[00:14:25.055 --> 00:14:27.316]  Superior Court by the senior Bush.
[00:14:27.716 --> 00:14:29.957]  George W. Bush nominated Walton to the U.S.
[00:14:29.997 --> 00:14:31.478]  District Court for D.C.
[00:14:32.038 --> 00:14:32.178]  in 01.
[00:14:32.859 --> 00:14:34.640]  The only thing is, I wouldn't call him conservative.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.300]  I mean, these people are anything but conservative.
[00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:37.141]  Walton...
[00:14:37.895 --> 00:14:51.141]  It was the judge who, under pressure from the Justice Department, placed a gag order on former FBI translator and whistleblower Sybil Edmonds and cleared his courtroom of the public after media in Edmonds' hearing in her case against the FBI.
[00:14:51.241 --> 00:14:58.684]  Edmonds brought to light important information about how the FBI failed to translate important wiretap intercepts before and after 9-11.
[00:14:59.625 --> 00:15:01.025]  That's not what she brought forward.
[00:15:01.886 --> 00:15:07.368]  They ordered her to go in and excise them where it showed clear prior knowledge in able danger.
[00:15:09.071 --> 00:15:18.954]  And I heard Lord Limbaugh and others yesterday, you know, in his weekend rebroadcast, talking about evil Bill Clinton and able danger and how they knew about Al Qaeda and ordered the FBI not to stop them.
[00:15:19.574 --> 00:15:21.355]  Well, that continued through to Bush.
[00:15:22.455 --> 00:15:24.996]  Bush reauthorized W1999.
[00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:37.920]  Clinton originally signed it in 96, ordering the FBI and BATF and every other federal agency, NSA, CIA, Defense Intelligence, ordering all these federal agencies, you don't touch these people.
[00:15:38.914 --> 00:15:40.675]  Here's the names of these Muslim groups.
[00:15:41.355 --> 00:15:42.455]  And we've had the U.S.
[00:15:42.535 --> 00:15:45.696]  Embassy head on who was saying, we can't let these guys back in.
[00:15:45.736 --> 00:15:48.197]  They said, listen, it's part of a covert anti-terror op.
[00:15:48.217 --> 00:15:49.017]  They're coming to the U.S.
[00:15:49.037 --> 00:15:49.617]  for training.
[00:15:50.157 --> 00:15:51.758]  Next you know they're flying planes into buildings.
[00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.118]  Folks, they were decoys.
[00:15:53.138 --> 00:15:55.959]  They were federal agents taking part in a live-action drill.
[00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.040]  That's confirmed.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.181]  Oh, my goodness.
[00:16:03.141 --> 00:16:08.643]  And so, again, it just blows my mind to see all this happening.
[00:16:09.867 --> 00:16:11.468]  But don't hold your breath.
[00:16:11.508 --> 00:16:26.478]  You know, while we're busy basting Bush and busy roasting him when he's just a gibbering puppet who literally works out three hours a day and takes a two-hour nap and watches his favorite soap operas, I mean, the guy's a complete joke.
[00:16:27.859 --> 00:16:28.719]  He's a dilettante.
[00:16:28.739 --> 00:16:29.920]  He isn't running anything.
[00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.262]  He just goes up there and stutters off pre-rehearsed lines.
[00:16:33.542 --> 00:16:34.563]  He's not a good actor.
[00:16:36.624 --> 00:16:39.206]  But... Alright, I'm...
[00:16:39.750 --> 00:16:40.690]  I'm now digressing.
[00:16:41.811 --> 00:16:45.493]  Look, folks, it's like the last year or two of Bill Clinton's presidency.
[00:16:45.513 --> 00:16:48.974]  I got a lot of heat because I said, why are we here attacking Bill Clinton?
[00:16:49.234 --> 00:16:50.635]  Nothing's going to happen to Bill Clinton.
[00:16:50.855 --> 00:16:52.296]  Bill Clinton and Hillary are puppets.
[00:16:52.516 --> 00:16:53.656]  Nothing's going to happen to them.
[00:16:53.776 --> 00:16:55.997]  Oh, you watch when Bush gets in, they're going down.
[00:16:56.337 --> 00:16:59.239]  First thing Bush does, leave them alone, Dan Burton.
[00:17:00.219 --> 00:17:06.302]  Congressman, no more investigations, no more red-handed, pardoning cocaine dealers in the White House.
[00:17:07.071 --> 00:17:08.552]  Chinese generals in the White House.
[00:17:09.152 --> 00:17:12.793]  I just don't want to spin my wheels in this mindless partisanship.
[00:17:13.074 --> 00:17:13.914]  It's a theater.
[00:17:14.454 --> 00:17:18.496]  Let's go behind the stage and show you who's directing the theater.
[00:17:19.156 --> 00:17:20.997]  That's the Rockefellers, the Rothschilds.
[00:17:22.558 --> 00:17:24.018]  These are the types of individuals.
[00:17:24.058 --> 00:17:25.459]  The Saxco Burgothas.
[00:17:26.019 --> 00:17:28.060]  These are the names we need to talk about.
[00:17:30.478 --> 00:17:31.759]  We need to talk about our troops.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:37.245]  October is the deadliest month in Iraq since January in the last 10, 11 months.
[00:17:37.265 --> 00:17:37.665]  The U.S.
[00:17:37.705 --> 00:17:45.973]  military, since six American soldiers were killed just yesterday alone, making October one of the deadliest months for U.S.
[00:17:46.014 --> 00:17:46.394]  troops.
[00:17:47.555 --> 00:17:53.341]  In the worst attack for Task Force Baghdad, soldiers died when their patrol took a roadside bomb.
[00:17:54.045 --> 00:17:56.246]  By the way, again, the real numbers are 8,000 plus dead.
[00:17:56.266 --> 00:17:56.666]  Upwards, right at
[00:18:25.405 --> 00:18:28.826]  I haven't looked it up in three or four months, so it was 8,000 three or four months ago.
[00:18:28.846 --> 00:18:29.647]  I don't know what it is now.
[00:18:29.707 --> 00:18:37.170]  It was like 19,000 injured in Iraq, in the war zone, since the invasion.
[00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.791]  So I would imagine the numbers are a lot higher now.
[00:18:42.772 --> 00:18:46.393]  I guess I've got to go look those up again, because I have a tendency to go off old numbers.
[00:18:46.433 --> 00:18:53.056]  But if we use the numbers from, what was it, three, four, maybe even five months ago, I'm kind of embarrassed that I haven't seen those numbers in a while, but...
[00:18:54.364 --> 00:18:58.026]  If this is the deadliest month in the last ten months, you can tell it's going to be a lot higher.
[00:18:58.786 --> 00:18:59.747]  So how many dead?
[00:18:59.767 --> 00:19:06.851]  I mean, they get up on Fox News and say, ah, you know, 2000 really isn't that big of a deal.
[00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:10.052]  I don't want to sound cavalier, but it's really not that big of a deal.
[00:19:10.473 --> 00:19:14.695]  Again, you tell that to the mothers whose sons and daughters are never coming home.
[00:19:15.595 --> 00:19:17.716]  You know, I heard the most amazing radio interview.
[00:19:17.736 --> 00:19:22.519]  Harry Brown, former Libertarian presidential candidate, has a show on Sunday nights on Genesis.
[00:19:23.991 --> 00:19:24.972]  No, it's Saturday night.
[00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:30.075]  And I was listening to it.
[00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:31.136]  I'll tell you about it after the break.
[00:19:31.176 --> 00:19:32.657]  We'll get into some other news and take your calls.
[00:19:33.237 --> 00:19:36.639]  And they had this neocon on there, and I couldn't believe it.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.463]  He said Private Lynch had never said it was a fable.
[00:19:41.983 --> 00:19:44.064]  The Pat Tillman case, it was a conspiracy.
[00:19:44.485 --> 00:19:49.168]  No one had ever said that that was all made up.
[00:19:49.928 --> 00:19:52.650]  I mean, it was just the denial of these people.
[00:19:54.805 --> 00:20:00.648]  The denial is just total willful ignorance.
[00:20:02.029 --> 00:20:05.691]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[00:20:06.091 --> 00:20:11.515]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[00:20:11.975 --> 00:20:13.055]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[00:20:13.095 --> 00:20:17.138]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[00:20:17.778 --> 00:20:31.086]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rulings 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act and Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[00:20:31.586 --> 00:20:36.929]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[00:20:37.209 --> 00:20:43.093]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[00:20:43.353 --> 00:20:43.413]  1-800-686-2237
[00:21:03.044 --> 00:21:04.086]  The war on terrorism.
[00:21:04.406 --> 00:21:07.190]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:21:07.471 --> 00:21:11.617]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:21:12.057 --> 00:21:12.878]  So what do you do?
[00:21:13.199 --> 00:21:17.766]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:20.368]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:21:20.868 --> 00:21:35.559]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:21:35.599 --> 00:21:42.664]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:21:42.944 --> 00:21:43.245]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:21:43.285 --> 00:21:44.987]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:04.142]  Government is best which governs least.
[00:22:04.683 --> 00:22:05.984]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:22:06.424 --> 00:22:09.126]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:22:09.587 --> 00:22:12.229]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:22:12.669 --> 00:22:19.114]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[00:22:19.474 --> 00:22:20.174]  We're good to go.
[00:22:20.194 --> 00:22:20.634]  We're good to go.
[00:22:39.962 --> 00:22:41.403]  I never voted for a war camel.
[00:22:41.583 --> 00:22:41.923]  Have you?
[00:22:42.503 --> 00:22:44.004]  Real conservatives hate Bush.

[00:22:48.225 --> 00:22:52.226]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[00:22:52.667 --> 00:22:53.727]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[00:22:54.307 --> 00:22:55.487]  Osama bin forgotten.

[00:23:02.307 --> 00:23:06.669]  Did you know that heart disease is the number one killer of men and women in the United States?
[00:23:07.129 --> 00:23:13.592]  In fact, the National Cholesterol Education Program has reported that each year more than a million Americans have heart attacks.
[00:23:14.062 --> 00:23:16.222]  And about a half a million die from heart disease.
[00:23:16.622 --> 00:23:22.643]  Did you also know that the higher your blood cholesterol level, the greater your risk for developing heart disease or having a heart attack?
[00:23:23.204 --> 00:23:42.527]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we are aware of the controversies surrounding the presumed safety of statin drugs in lowering cholesterol, which is why, as part of our ongoing commitment to your safety and health, we invite you to learn more about Google by Himalaya, a highly effective and extremely safe natural herbal supplement widely recognized for its cholesterol-regulating properties.

[00:23:52.912 --> 00:23:55.133]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:23:55.153 --> 00:23:56.373]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:24:12.336 --> 00:24:16.799]  Coming up, I'm just going to spend a few minutes on Halloween and tell you why I think it's a bad holiday.
[00:24:18.821 --> 00:24:20.162]  And there's many reasons for that.
[00:24:21.563 --> 00:24:23.784]  We're going to be taking your calls as well here in just a moment.
[00:24:23.804 --> 00:24:28.407]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:29.748 --> 00:24:33.731]  We have this new Supreme Court nominee that Bush has brought forward.
[00:24:33.811 --> 00:24:34.652]  Bush has nominated...
[00:24:35.575 --> 00:24:42.219]  Alito, the Supreme Court choice named after a week of political difficulty over Harriet Myers.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:48.503]  And right now, I've done some preliminary checking this morning on him.
[00:24:49.464 --> 00:24:52.086]  Looks like he is a big-time police state judge.
[00:24:52.926 --> 00:24:55.968]  A lot of rulings butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:24:56.068 --> 00:24:57.009]  Not conservative.
[00:24:57.929 --> 00:24:59.210]  But it's going to be just like Roberts.
[00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.272]  We're going to hear how conservative... I just invented a new word.
[00:25:02.352 --> 00:25:03.153]  Conservative of...
[00:25:03.746 --> 00:25:08.067]  We're going to hear how conservative he is, and then we're probably going to find out he's anti-gun.
[00:25:08.967 --> 00:25:17.230]  Roberts is now Chief Justice, and CBS News has reported that he is, quote, for sensible gun control.
[00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:18.670]  Oh, sensible.
[00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:22.291]  Oh, he's like the majority of people, CBS News says.
[00:25:22.611 --> 00:25:28.012]  Of course, the majority are not major poll show, but CBS says, oh, he's like the majority of people.
[00:25:28.312 --> 00:25:29.853]  He wants some gun control.
[00:25:30.393 --> 00:25:42.801]  It's like George Bush, the president, wants to sign the assault weapons ban, just like our new attorney general wants the assault weapons ban and more, believes in his heart and strict gun control.
[00:25:43.382 --> 00:25:45.603]  And I'm an evil liberal for being against it.
[00:25:46.063 --> 00:25:48.585]  Literally, I've been called that for being against Gonzalez, folks.
[00:25:50.326 --> 00:25:57.471]  And we're looking at this judge and very, very serious police state activities on his part.
[00:25:58.797 --> 00:26:00.579]  But he'll be hailed by the neocons.
[00:26:00.619 --> 00:26:02.040]  They'll lie on talk radio.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:02.680]  They'll get him in.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.201]  Don't worry.
[00:26:04.182 --> 00:26:09.126]  And then a couple years from now, we can be pulling our hair out going, Man, I tell you, Bush Sr.
[00:26:09.146 --> 00:26:10.126]  put in that guy.
[00:26:10.146 --> 00:26:11.427]  He turned out to be really bad.
[00:26:11.808 --> 00:26:14.690]  Reagan appointed that guy, and he turned out being really bad.
[00:26:14.970 --> 00:26:17.372]  Why is it they keep voting so liberal?
[00:26:18.093 --> 00:26:19.634]  Because that's the agenda.
[00:26:19.714 --> 00:26:20.435]  Big government.
[00:26:20.755 --> 00:26:22.096]  Loss of the Second Amendment.
[00:26:22.577 --> 00:26:23.417]  Open borders.
[00:26:23.818 --> 00:26:25.299]  Centralization of control.
[00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:27.881]  Flushing due process down the toilet.
[00:26:29.716 --> 00:26:32.477]  So I don't trust this guy one bit.
[00:26:32.737 --> 00:26:34.458]  You know, whoever they put in, they're going to be bad.
[00:26:34.498 --> 00:26:36.099]  I mean, Bush already tried to give us Gonzalez.
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:42.382]  Anti-gun, open border, believes the president's above the law openly.
[00:26:43.482 --> 00:26:44.703]  Wrote the torture memos.
[00:26:45.143 --> 00:26:46.744]  I mean, that should tell you everything you need to know.
[00:26:46.764 --> 00:26:53.847]  And then we found out Myers was pro-abortion, pro-open border, just a bunch of other horrible stuff.
[00:26:54.447 --> 00:26:56.688]  And then we started getting press releases from the White House.
[00:26:56.768 --> 00:26:58.269]  No, she was born again!
[00:26:58.982 --> 00:27:02.864]  Three years ago, secretly, and now she's against abortion.
[00:27:03.124 --> 00:27:03.565]  Sure.
[00:27:04.205 --> 00:27:24.317]  Moving quickly to pick a Supreme Court nominee after the last election with your name, President Bush on Monday nominated Circuit Court Judge Samuel Alito, a favorite of conservatives, of the Bill Bennett type conservatives, to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.
[00:27:26.303 --> 00:27:36.831]  Judge Alito's reputation has only grown over the span of his service, Bush said, from the White House, with Alito by his side, with Tito by his side.
[00:27:36.851 --> 00:27:43.176]  He has participated in thousands of appeals and authored hundreds of opinions.
[00:27:43.636 --> 00:27:52.283]  The record reveals a thoughtful judge who considers the legal merits carefully and applies the law in a principled fashion.
[00:27:53.246 --> 00:27:57.469]  That's what Bush said about a month ago about Gonzalez when he floated him.
[00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:59.771]  Alito, a former U.S.
[00:27:59.831 --> 00:28:08.477]  attorney who has been a judge for 15 years, said while on the bench he has kept in mind what he called a solemn responsibility.
[00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:21.487]  Federal judges, he said in a quote, federal judges have the duty to interpret the Constitution and the laws faithfully and fairly to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans, but
[00:28:22.327 --> 00:28:23.668]  This guy's done the opposite, folks.
[00:28:24.028 --> 00:28:32.973]  And to do these things with care and with restraint, always keeping in mind the limited role that the court plays in our constitutional system.
[00:28:33.353 --> 00:28:40.638]  Well, you need to tell us right now, would you have voted against the land grab decision in New London, Connecticut?
[00:28:41.698 --> 00:28:43.399]  How would you vote on the Second Amendment?
[00:28:43.479 --> 00:28:45.340]  We need these questions answered now.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:46.341]  How about abortion?
[00:28:46.661 --> 00:28:51.384]  You need to answer all these private property, abortion, Second Amendment, the borders...
[00:28:52.466 --> 00:28:56.688]  You need to answer the federal powers question.
[00:28:56.728 --> 00:28:59.349]  You need to answer all of this right now.
[00:29:00.129 --> 00:29:07.612]  I don't want to hear all these paid-off, phony conservative groups, Judas goats who are actually paid off to lead us astray.
[00:29:07.852 --> 00:29:11.073]  I don't want to hear all them telling me how he's conservative like Roberts.
[00:29:13.174 --> 00:29:15.775]  I don't want to hear that.
[00:29:16.495 --> 00:29:18.075]  I want these put to this guy.
[00:29:18.175 --> 00:29:19.416]  I want a litmus test.
[00:29:21.227 --> 00:29:23.167]  That's what I want from this guy.
[00:29:23.187 --> 00:29:29.368]  But let me tell you, I spent some time looking at his rulings, and it doesn't look good.
[00:29:32.689 --> 00:29:36.570]  A preliminary view of it, he is better than Myers and Gonzalez.
[00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:41.171]  But that's only because we are regurgitating their other picks.
[00:29:42.291 --> 00:29:43.611]  But sometimes it's worse.
[00:29:46.431 --> 00:29:49.192]  It's like that New York police chief, and then we get Chertoff.
[00:29:51.554 --> 00:29:52.494]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.514 --> 00:29:54.555]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.575 --> 00:29:58.256]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:11.901]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[00:30:12.161 --> 00:30:13.682]  And what about those government agencies?
[00:30:13.722 --> 00:30:15.963]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[00:30:16.143 --> 00:30:19.704]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[00:30:20.064 --> 00:30:20.705]  We're good to go.

[00:32:01.707 --> 00:32:03.249]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:32:03.410 --> 00:32:04.531]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:04.711 --> 00:32:08.136]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache and nausea.
[00:32:08.236 --> 00:32:16.086]  Phenol, ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:16.587 --> 00:32:20.489]  PTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:20.609 --> 00:32:21.049]  Fragrance?
[00:32:21.430 --> 00:32:26.192]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:26.332 --> 00:32:31.014]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:32:31.235 --> 00:32:33.656]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:32:34.036 --> 00:32:37.458]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:32:37.598 --> 00:32:41.159]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:33:01.765 --> 00:33:02.488]  I think.
[00:33:24.221 --> 00:33:27.103]  Coming up in the next hour, Tex Mars will be joining us.
[00:33:27.143 --> 00:33:31.906]  Then in the third hour, the Senate has passed it.
[00:33:31.946 --> 00:33:33.467]  It is now in the House.
[00:33:35.469 --> 00:33:39.491]  Total liability protection for all vaccine makers in perpetuity.
[00:33:39.832 --> 00:33:43.434]  So you thought they were already damaging children and poisoning adults?
[00:33:46.542 --> 00:33:50.084]  And cancer viruses publicly being found in many different vaccines.
[00:33:50.704 --> 00:33:52.004]  Oh, now it's going to be even worse.
[00:33:52.185 --> 00:33:57.267]  And there's forced inoculation in the legislation as well.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:33:59.461]  We're good to go.
[00:34:29.744 --> 00:34:35.827]  It's now up on the shopping cart at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[00:34:38.288 --> 00:34:40.129]  And that's the new book by Tex Mars.
[00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:42.370]  Tex hasn't had a book in four or five years.
[00:34:43.691 --> 00:34:49.434]  And normally Tex writes a book every year, but he's been spending four or five years writing Codex Magica.
[00:34:49.454 --> 00:34:54.577]  Instead of being 300 pages long, Codex Magica is over 650 pages long.
[00:34:57.871 --> 00:35:03.272]  And Codex Magica, secret signs, mysterious symbols, and hidden codes of the Illuminati.
[00:35:03.912 --> 00:35:15.955]  And folks, once you've read this book, I mean, it's taken me over a decade to learn what I know about the occult and the hidden signs and how it's on TV and on buildings and in corporate symbols and in hand signs.
[00:35:18.795 --> 00:35:20.116]  Tex knows a lot more than I do.
[00:35:20.356 --> 00:35:22.216]  He's been studying it for 20, 30 years.
[00:35:22.656 --> 00:35:23.956]  He's put it all in this book.
[00:35:24.016 --> 00:35:27.197]  It's taken him almost five years to write this.
[00:35:28.214 --> 00:35:31.975]  He was going to release this book two years ago, but he just kept saying, no, no, no, I'm going to add more.
[00:35:32.555 --> 00:35:35.316]  I mean, this is a labor of love, and yes, we're carrying it.
[00:35:36.016 --> 00:35:36.917]  It just came out.
[00:35:37.457 --> 00:35:40.118]  In fact, the books are being shipped from the publisher, from the printer.
[00:35:40.458 --> 00:35:42.018]  Right now, they haven't even hit Austin yet.
[00:35:42.058 --> 00:35:43.099]  Texas and Austin, too.
[00:35:44.519 --> 00:35:47.260]  And as soon as they get here next week, I mean, they're being shipped right now.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:47.880]  They've been printed.
[00:35:50.365 --> 00:35:55.791]  We'll ship them out to you UPS, and they also make a great gift, so be the first to get Codex Magica.
[00:35:55.811 --> 00:36:05.200]  You can read a lengthy synopsis of what the book covers right now up on InfoWars.com.
[00:36:05.961 --> 00:36:10.105]  The secret signs, mysterious symbols, and hidden codes of the Illuminati.
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:13.902]  And this is just such an important book.
[00:36:14.363 --> 00:36:21.712]  The hand signs they use, the symbols, who controls it, the highest levels, the different orders within the group.
[00:36:24.976 --> 00:36:26.237]  Just wait until you see this.
[00:36:27.378 --> 00:36:28.480]  Just wait until you see this.
[00:36:29.247 --> 00:36:30.468]  It's amazing.
[00:36:30.508 --> 00:36:32.731]  I mean, really, I could talk for 10 hours about it.
[00:36:33.071 --> 00:36:40.419]  You need to get Codex Magica available at Infowars.com or by calling toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:36:40.439 --> 00:36:44.243]  Don't forget, we're also carrying Jim Tucker's new book,
[00:36:48.767 --> 00:37:02.195]  The Bilderberg Diaries, an amazing 25-plus year odyssey sneaking into these meetings inside the elite, inside those that control the world government, full of photos and documents and a lot of never-before-seen information.
[00:37:02.735 --> 00:37:10.159]  I mean, it is the one-stop shop, this book, to really understand the Bilderberg Group, the pinnacle of elite power.
[00:37:11.283 --> 00:37:13.044]  We're also now carrying that book in the bookstore.
[00:37:13.064 --> 00:37:24.847]  We're going to be adding a lot of new books and videos to the bookstore here in the next few months because I'm about to open a physical bookstore here in Austin, Texas, and I'll soon reveal that address to you on air.
[00:37:24.867 --> 00:37:26.847]  But the office isn't open yet to the public.
[00:37:27.468 --> 00:37:28.708]  We're still setting everything up.
[00:37:30.023 --> 00:37:35.064]  But Codex Magica, or call toll-free to get any of my other videos or books that we carry.
[00:37:35.084 --> 00:37:40.166]  A lot of big specials we're offering right now.

[00:38:01.127 --> 00:38:03.728]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to calls, and we'll get back into the news.
[00:38:04.168 --> 00:38:05.709]  David and Mass, thanks for holding.
[00:38:05.729 --> 00:38:06.129]  Go ahead.
[00:38:06.849 --> 00:38:07.749]  Alex, how are you today?
[00:38:07.829 --> 00:38:08.190]  Good, sir.
[00:38:09.630 --> 00:38:16.073]  Thomas Barnett was on C-SPAN 2 last night in an interview conducted by Tom Feeney.
[00:38:16.153 --> 00:38:18.834]  He's the Republican representative from Florida.
[00:38:19.955 --> 00:38:21.015]  And I recorded it.
[00:38:21.075 --> 00:38:24.457]  I'll be happy to give you a copy if you're... I would like a copy.
[00:38:24.657 --> 00:38:27.118]  For those who don't know, tell us about Mr. Barnett.
[00:38:28.552 --> 00:38:38.136]  Well, he was the guy that was doing a lot of advising of the Pentagon via the Naval War College.
[00:38:38.377 --> 00:38:41.958]  His new book is called A Blueprint for Action.
[00:38:42.658 --> 00:38:52.303]  Of course, it's the typical rhetoric of how globalization is so great and how we can establish military dominance anywhere.
[00:38:52.343 --> 00:38:57.525]  The most shocking thing, Alex, is he said a couple of things, which I'll send you the thing or
[00:38:58.708 --> 00:39:07.992]  He said one world currency is a must, absolutely, and that we should make sure that Iran does possess nuclear weapons.
[00:39:08.152 --> 00:39:09.052]  Oh, they should have them.
[00:39:09.732 --> 00:39:13.854]  Oh, I know, and China is the model and is our really good buddy.
[00:39:14.374 --> 00:39:24.558]  Because, I mean, we can't forget that Prime Minister Ahmadinejad says Israel has to be wiped off the map, and so we have to make sure that they have nuclear weapons.
[00:39:25.382 --> 00:39:29.025]  Well, you know, his view is very popular in the Pentagon.
[00:39:29.185 --> 00:39:30.886]  He's one of their chief strategists, as you know.
[00:39:31.207 --> 00:39:35.310]  And he's a darling of the Wall Street Journal and of Brian Lamb at C-SPAN.
[00:39:35.850 --> 00:39:37.872]  They just constantly advertise for the guy.
[00:39:37.912 --> 00:39:46.038]  And again, when I was going to set him up for the show, my producer set him up, but he Googled me, and he wouldn't come on.
[00:39:46.058 --> 00:39:48.120]  And I called him during a break, and I said, please come on.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:49.061]  He started cussing at me.
[00:39:49.827 --> 00:39:52.148]  And I said, listen, you know, you're for world government.
[00:39:52.188 --> 00:39:54.229]  You believe that the military works for Wall Street.
[00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:56.109]  Just come on and defend your ideas.
[00:39:56.129 --> 00:40:00.271]  And he started cussing at me, and I said, look, we're going to defend the sovereignty of the U.S.
[00:40:00.811 --> 00:40:05.133]  And he just hissed at me, literally hissed and said, you just keep on dreaming.
[00:40:05.822 --> 00:40:06.362]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:40:06.402 --> 00:40:13.547]  I mean, he totally advocates for all the World Bank and the IMF to totally dictate the structural adjustment.
[00:40:13.627 --> 00:40:16.749]  And listen, we have their own chief economist.
[00:40:16.789 --> 00:40:20.011]  It was so evil, he resigned and said, I can't do this morally.
[00:40:20.331 --> 00:40:22.492]  And they actually say they want to bankrupt us.
[00:40:22.752 --> 00:40:23.613]  No middle class.
[00:40:23.993 --> 00:40:26.275]  Everybody living like prisoners in compact cities.
[00:40:26.755 --> 00:40:27.876]  This has been on the BBC.
[00:40:27.896 --> 00:40:30.597]  I mean, we're actually going to be slave prisoners.
[00:40:30.897 --> 00:40:33.279]  And this bastard, this piece of garbage...
[00:40:33.659 --> 00:40:34.700]  Alex, let me ask you a question.
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:37.302]  How do you want to get... I'll either A, send it via DVD to your Lamar address, or...
[00:40:49.582 --> 00:40:55.026]  I can download it to a site called YouSendIt.com, which they send you an email.
[00:40:55.046 --> 00:40:59.909]  Well, frankly, if you want to do this, my problem is I get 2,000 emails and then don't see half of them.
[00:40:59.949 --> 00:41:01.970]  I try to look at it all.
[00:41:02.190 --> 00:41:03.571]  I know you have a secret email.
[00:41:04.012 --> 00:41:04.672]  I'm aware of that.
[00:41:05.232 --> 00:41:07.734]  Well, I do, and then it already gets like 300 a day.
[00:41:07.754 --> 00:41:09.655]  I mean, your choice.
[00:41:10.016 --> 00:41:10.396]  You know what?
[00:41:10.416 --> 00:41:15.879]  If you want to do some work, you could download it and send it to us and burn us a copy and mail it.
[00:41:15.899 --> 00:41:16.660]  That would be very thankful.
[00:41:17.603 --> 00:41:18.263]  Oh, I'll do it.
[00:41:18.283 --> 00:41:18.944]  Yeah, no problem.
[00:41:19.064 --> 00:41:20.385]  I'll absolutely do that.
[00:41:20.425 --> 00:41:40.616]  Yeah, and at the beginning of the show, you were mentioning, be aware of further demonization against Venezuela, because Chavez recently, if you weren't aware, has totally detached the Bolivar, I believe, that Venezuelan currency has been completely detached from the Federal Reserve.
[00:41:40.876 --> 00:41:42.917]  They're floating it to find their own value.
[00:41:43.298 --> 00:41:45.559]  So it's looking like Chavez is definitely...
[00:41:46.503 --> 00:41:49.764]  I mean, you know, he's totally in resistance to U.S.
[00:41:49.844 --> 00:41:50.325]  policy.
[00:41:51.185 --> 00:41:54.726]  Exactly, and this will probably be the last straw.
[00:41:55.206 --> 00:41:59.588]  Saying that Satanists run America, and that's basically what he said.
[00:41:59.608 --> 00:42:01.049]  I mean, that's it.
[00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.749]  It's over for him.
[00:42:02.757 --> 00:42:02.958]  Yeah.
[00:42:02.978 --> 00:42:04.039]  It was a failed coup attempt, yeah.
[00:42:21.411 --> 00:42:27.556]  Greg Pallis of the BBC Newsnight Reporter said four days before it happened on this show, it was going to happen and then it happened.
[00:42:27.576 --> 00:42:28.156]  Thanks for the call.
[00:42:28.536 --> 00:42:29.557]  David, a great call.
[00:42:30.017 --> 00:42:33.240]  Yeah, you know, Barnett, I wish Barnett would come on and defend his ideas.
[00:42:35.101 --> 00:42:36.422]  And they're so childish.
[00:42:38.844 --> 00:42:43.367]  But that's the grade level that the average intellectual is at today.
[00:42:45.316 --> 00:42:47.678]  We had General Parton on to debunk him.
[00:42:48.019 --> 00:42:51.882]  And this is the same thing they've been hearing at the Pentagon for 50 years from people like Barnett.
[00:42:54.645 --> 00:42:58.869]  And for those that don't know, Barnett openly says global government's taking over, global currency.
[00:42:58.909 --> 00:42:59.590]  I was aware of that.
[00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:01.532]  His first book was the Pentagon's New Map.
[00:43:02.753 --> 00:43:04.114]  Now it's the Plan of Action or whatever.
[00:43:04.154 --> 00:43:04.975]  I haven't read the new book.
[00:43:05.035 --> 00:43:06.937]  I've sent a copy, I'm told.
[00:43:07.898 --> 00:43:08.799]  But I've seen it online.
[00:43:09.710 --> 00:43:15.256]  But, I mean, he just openly sits up there and says that America's gone and global government runs us and it's real funny.
[00:43:15.296 --> 00:43:24.486]  And I got video of him up in front of all these generals at the Pentagon in an amphitheater, stadium seating, and the generals are smiling as they talk about the end of this country.
[00:43:24.507 --> 00:43:26.369]  I mean, he should be arrested.
[00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:30.113]  Seriously, folks, in a proper America.
[00:43:31.551 --> 00:43:39.153]  He could be a private citizen all day long and run around saying, destroy America, take over America, end America, give us over to the globalists.
[00:43:39.573 --> 00:43:45.575]  But to work in the Naval War College and to be pushing these plans, he should be removed at least.
[00:43:46.955 --> 00:43:49.076]  But oh no, no, I'm the bad person.
[00:43:49.676 --> 00:43:50.996]  I'm the bad person, see?
[00:43:51.496 --> 00:43:53.457]  And this is what the neocon's goal is.
[00:43:54.218 --> 00:44:07.786]  They're going to use American military strength to take over pathetic, weakling Third World nations who are not a threat, but that have resources that can be sold, that are not under the IMF, World Bank, Central Banking cartel.
[00:44:08.626 --> 00:44:10.467]  As the last caller put it, the Federal Reserve System.
[00:44:10.707 --> 00:44:13.089]  That's a global system, owned by the same individuals.
[00:44:13.189 --> 00:44:18.572]  Literally, there are a handful of private families who own the printing presses of the dominant countries.
[00:44:19.016 --> 00:44:25.559]  Can you imagine how powerful you'd be if for a hundred years you owned the printing presses that printed the money?
[00:44:27.579 --> 00:44:30.340]  We hear about Bill Gates being worth 60-something billion dollars.
[00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:32.981]  We hear about Warren Buffett with 40 billion.
[00:44:33.382 --> 00:44:34.182]  That's nothing!
[00:44:35.362 --> 00:44:39.864]  They're high-level elitists, but not in the very top room.
[00:44:39.884 --> 00:44:42.445]  They're not a Rothschild, a Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
[00:44:44.306 --> 00:44:46.508]  The Saxe-Coburg-Gothas, that's the Queen of England, folks.
[00:44:46.528 --> 00:44:47.269]  That's their real name.
[00:44:47.289 --> 00:44:49.151]  See, they give you a brand name, Windsor.
[00:44:50.292 --> 00:44:50.813]  Fake name.
[00:44:52.134 --> 00:44:52.734]  It's a brand name.
[00:44:53.415 --> 00:44:55.057]  They own the oil companies.
[00:44:55.097 --> 00:44:56.398]  They own the property.
[00:44:56.438 --> 00:45:01.343]  They literally, it's in mainstream news articles that they have liens against our national parks.
[00:45:01.743 --> 00:45:03.005]  They own our national debt.
[00:45:04.786 --> 00:45:07.169]  They own the endowments for our universities.
[00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:13.996]  That is, they have steering power through the universities, through the endowments, that their subsidiaries have paid for.
[00:45:14.677 --> 00:45:16.940]  They own a lot of the stock in our media.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.542]  Fast food restaurants.
[00:45:19.323 --> 00:45:20.244]  Movie change.
[00:45:20.945 --> 00:45:21.806]  Just everything.
[00:45:21.906 --> 00:45:23.228]  It's unbelievable.
[00:45:24.249 --> 00:45:25.691]  It's unbelievable.
[00:45:26.713 --> 00:45:26.813]  And...
[00:45:27.595 --> 00:45:28.955]  They create a global government.
[00:45:28.995 --> 00:45:39.157]  They get our governments to sign through treaties to sign away their governmental powers to these private IMF, World Bank, World Trade Organization.
[00:45:39.437 --> 00:45:42.658]  Folks, they're as private as a McDonald's.
[00:45:42.798 --> 00:45:49.639]  They're as private as an indoor basketball court at Mall of America.
[00:45:50.119 --> 00:45:53.420]  They're as private as Walmart.
[00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:55.460]  And
[00:45:56.352 --> 00:45:59.215]  Our government openly is signing all its authority over to them.
[00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:05.622]  Then they come in through treaties and local and state agreements and set up regional governments that are private but have governmental power.
[00:46:06.167 --> 00:46:19.811]  So they're circumventing all of our checks and balances, putting in electronic voting machines, putting in cameras and face-scanning cameras and RFID tracker systems and license plate scanning systems and face-scanning systems, a whole prison grid.
[00:46:20.231 --> 00:46:24.812]  MIT Magazine openly says the Pentagon designed all these cameras and stuff, you see.
[00:46:25.072 --> 00:46:27.053]  Lockheed openly is moving in to manage it.
[00:46:28.772 --> 00:46:36.339]  Openly running commercials where we're going to protect you, and they show troops in compounds with video screens protecting America.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:41.003]  They're putting in the total grid, and they're horrible people.
[00:46:43.245 --> 00:46:44.746]  And China is their model.
[00:46:44.806 --> 00:46:46.087]  They love China.
[00:46:46.668 --> 00:46:50.011]  They love the fact they kill newborn babies if it's your third child.
[00:46:50.842 --> 00:46:52.803]  They love the fact they have a forced abortion.
[00:46:53.144 --> 00:46:54.204]  They love the fact.
[00:46:54.925 --> 00:46:57.947]  The Fortune 500 can't keep their hands off of China.
[00:46:58.227 --> 00:46:59.948]  It's their one only burning desire.
[00:47:00.028 --> 00:47:02.550]  It was the Rockefeller president.
[00:47:03.691 --> 00:47:05.712]  It was David Rockefeller who went over there.
[00:47:05.792 --> 00:47:07.253]  And Nelson and Kissinger.
[00:47:07.553 --> 00:47:08.374]  Bush Sr.
[00:47:08.634 --> 00:47:10.015]  was the envoy.
[00:47:10.355 --> 00:47:11.696]  Lived there for two years.
[00:47:12.197 --> 00:47:13.197]  Opening China up.
[00:47:13.317 --> 00:47:20.142]  Making the agreements to use that slave labor to leverage out all their competition globally with select crony capitalism.
[00:47:21.866 --> 00:47:25.007]  And you try to explain this to conservatives, they don't even understand it.
[00:47:25.207 --> 00:47:27.028]  You try to explain it to liberals, they don't understand it.
[00:47:30.069 --> 00:47:47.814]  That's why it doesn't matter if it's Nixon or Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan or George Bush, they're going to give China all the missile secrets, they're going to give them all the supercomputers, they're going to give them the cruise missile computers, they're going to give them all our jobs, they're going to give them all the weapons, and they're going to give them Taiwan just like they gave them the Panama Canal!
[00:47:49.221 --> 00:47:52.406]  Because they see us as slaves, folks, and they love China.
[00:47:55.290 --> 00:47:57.594]  It's like the globalist Pepe Le Pew.
[00:47:58.395 --> 00:48:02.040]  Ever seen that cartoon in China's The Cat that the skunk's chasing after?
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.544]  I mean, literally, they're in a love fest.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:06.100]  Oh, you slaughter.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:07.781]  You have stadium executions.
[00:48:07.801 --> 00:48:09.101]  You have mobile death vans.
[00:48:09.342 --> 00:48:12.443]  Oh, you're melting people down for their collagen.
[00:48:12.963 --> 00:48:14.023]  Oh, I love you.
[00:48:14.123 --> 00:48:16.004]  Oh, here's more UN awards.
[00:48:16.304 --> 00:48:17.024]  Oh, we love you.
[00:48:17.104 --> 00:48:18.565]  Oh, you're so darling.
[00:48:19.065 --> 00:48:29.629]  Oh, let's have some rhetoric and fight with each other so you can crack down on your public and use false nationalism and so we can crack down on ours and threaten to nuke us again and we'll threaten you and we'll give you all the secrets.
[00:48:29.849 --> 00:48:30.449]  Oh, we love you.
[00:48:30.649 --> 00:48:33.310]  Oh, Bob in Maine.
[00:48:33.370 --> 00:48:34.331]  Bob, thanks for holding.
[00:48:34.351 --> 00:48:34.791]  Go ahead.
[00:48:35.672 --> 00:48:36.973]  Oh, yeah, Alex.
[00:48:37.573 --> 00:48:51.701]  What happens when or if someone actually comes up with real charges rather than these watered-down ones that don't connect them to, like... There have been charges before against presidents, and then the senator or the congressman who was investigating it, but their plane blows up.
[00:48:52.842 --> 00:48:55.464]  I mean, it's happened just 50 times, I mean, more.
[00:48:55.524 --> 00:48:56.484]  It's happened so many times.
[00:48:56.964 --> 00:48:59.366]  Or they suddenly get a brain tumor and die in one week.
[00:49:00.006 --> 00:49:03.188]  Or they get shot five times, and then it's a lone crazy who did it.
[00:49:03.988 --> 00:49:04.029]  Or...
[00:49:05.461 --> 00:49:11.844]  If you had multiple people, like a large group, and you made them known large enough so if they were killed... Well, here's the problem.
[00:49:11.884 --> 00:49:15.325]  The globalists have been in power so long that every U.S.
[00:49:15.385 --> 00:49:16.285]  attorney is theirs.
[00:49:16.365 --> 00:49:17.326]  Presidents appoint them.
[00:49:18.086 --> 00:49:21.547]  And these federal grand juries are controlled by federal prosecutors.
[00:49:22.208 --> 00:49:24.509]  You can have state grand juries do it.
[00:49:26.409 --> 00:49:35.113]  But Americans are so sheep-like, no longer land of the free, home of the brave, that most people on a grand jury, if some guy in a suit tells them not to indict, they don't do it.
[00:49:37.014 --> 00:49:41.116]  You know, the grand jury is supposed to be in charge, not the prosecutor.
[00:49:41.196 --> 00:49:44.518]  It's like the jury is supposed to be in charge, not the judge.
[00:49:44.798 --> 00:49:53.923]  But see, everything is an inverse of what it's supposed to be, because they just slowly, the government declared powers it didn't have until it became customary and accepted.
[00:49:53.943 --> 00:49:58.405]  Alright, so you think that this rotten fruit is just going to eat itself?
[00:49:58.485 --> 00:50:00.366]  There's nothing that's going to stop them?
[00:50:02.623 --> 00:50:09.728]  No, a lot of things are going to stop them, just because their own enforcers are going to be woken up by you and I, and then it's just like Celchescu.
[00:50:10.509 --> 00:50:12.510]  You know, one day people just didn't follow him anymore.
[00:50:12.910 --> 00:50:15.512]  So it is rotten to the core.
[00:50:15.592 --> 00:50:18.655]  I mean, believe me, we've never had so much support as we have now.
[00:50:19.155 --> 00:50:27.901]  If you want to call us the rebels or the independence crowd, the pro-America crowd, the counter-revolutionaries is what we really are, we're actually winning right now.
[00:50:29.722 --> 00:50:30.343]  I sure hope so.
[00:50:31.368 --> 00:50:32.429]  Well, it's up to you, sir.
[00:50:33.070 --> 00:50:37.514]  I mean, if you take action and exert yourself in the Infowar, we will bring them down.
[00:50:38.715 --> 00:50:44.100]  But if you don't, we are literally going to be like cattle within ten years.
[00:50:44.921 --> 00:50:45.842]  Maybe even sooner.
[00:50:45.862 --> 00:50:48.784]  I mean, it's going to get really bad, brother.
[00:50:49.565 --> 00:50:49.986]  Really bad.
[00:50:50.386 --> 00:50:52.067]  They're going to be in work brigades, everything.
[00:50:52.208 --> 00:50:53.469]  We're going to be actual slaves.
[00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:55.170]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.591]  Stay with us.
[00:51:01.681 --> 00:51:08.523]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.843 --> 00:51:10.224]  That's right folks, DVD.

[00:51:26.529 --> 00:51:37.175]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.316 --> 00:51:39.217]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:54.160]  We're good to go.
[00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:18.219]  I think so too.
[00:53:33.328 --> 00:53:34.109]  We're good to go.
[00:53:34.129 --> 00:53:34.709]  We're good to go.
[00:54:04.038 --> 00:54:10.061]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.681 --> 00:54:13.622]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.103 --> 00:54:21.406]  We're going to take some more calls coming up in the next segment, in the five-minute segment, and then we've got Tex Mars coming on.
[00:54:21.426 --> 00:54:22.966]  But let me just read what Chavez said.
[00:54:23.967 --> 00:54:26.768]  Chavez calls for ban on Halloween.
[00:54:28.846 --> 00:54:34.169]  This is Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez who's urged families not to mark Halloween, calling it a U.S.
[00:54:34.229 --> 00:54:36.551]  custom alien to South American nation.
[00:54:37.351 --> 00:54:38.952]  He's not really calling for a ban, folks.
[00:54:38.972 --> 00:54:40.533]  He's saying people shouldn't celebrate it.
[00:54:41.313 --> 00:54:42.914]  I agree with Hugo Chavez, folks.
[00:54:43.455 --> 00:54:46.757]  Families go and begin to disguise their children as witches.
[00:54:47.377 --> 00:54:52.520]  This is contrary to our way, Mr. Chavez said during his weekly radio and TV show.
[00:54:52.540 --> 00:54:57.183]  Everybody knows what cloak you put on is what attitude you take on.
[00:54:58.007 --> 00:55:02.250]  He said Halloween was a game of terror, the AP News Agency reported.
[00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:05.031]  Mr. Chavez is known as a fierce critic of the U.S.
[00:55:05.051 --> 00:55:07.853]  government and President George W. Bush personally.
[00:55:08.293 --> 00:55:11.535]  The president recently described the Bush administration as a terrorist government.
[00:55:12.156 --> 00:55:14.297]  Mr. Chavez said Halloween was part of a U.S.
[00:55:14.337 --> 00:55:18.980]  culture of putting fear into other nations, putting fear into their own people.
[00:55:20.261 --> 00:55:21.281]  That's true, folks.
[00:55:21.301 --> 00:55:26.885]  That's what the pagans did it for, was to exercise power over the people in the local juridic area.
[00:55:27.421 --> 00:55:27.601]  I think.
[00:55:40.436 --> 00:55:50.601]  He did not refer to incidents earlier this month when lanterns made from hollowed pumpkins carrying anti-government messages appeared in several places in the capital, Caracas.
[00:55:51.181 --> 00:55:57.544]  Halloween, a pagan festival characterized by mischief-making, is marked every year on the 31st of October.
[00:55:58.064 --> 00:56:00.325]  Oh, BBC admits it's pagan.
[00:56:00.385 --> 00:56:01.105]  Of course it is.
[00:56:01.506 --> 00:56:02.706]  Samhain.
[00:56:04.927 --> 00:56:09.209]  Even National Geographic, it's in my new film, has the bodies they've dug up
[00:56:10.020 --> 00:56:10.480]  Tortured.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:11.860]  Heads cut off.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:12.681]  Hearts cut out.
[00:56:13.661 --> 00:56:14.801]  Some perfectly preserved.
[00:56:14.821 --> 00:56:15.801]  They were put in peat bogs.
[00:56:17.482 --> 00:56:18.322]  By the Druids.
[00:56:18.502 --> 00:56:21.603]  And, you know, all these people that are into the occult go, Oh, we're not involved in that.
[00:56:21.663 --> 00:56:22.643]  We've never been involved in that.
[00:56:22.923 --> 00:56:23.723]  Well, I'm sorry.
[00:56:23.783 --> 00:56:25.524]  That's what your roots go back to.
[00:56:25.544 --> 00:56:27.324]  So stop denying it.
[00:56:28.865 --> 00:56:38.387]  But listen, the problem with Halloween, the big problem is, is that it teaches people that evil is a witch with a wart on her nose on a broom or a goblin or a skeleton or a demon.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.882]  Paul told us that the devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[00:56:44.403 --> 00:56:45.443]  And there's other passages.
[00:56:45.563 --> 00:56:47.044]  Satan looks like an angel of light.
[00:56:47.324 --> 00:56:48.625]  And that's the way it is in the real world.
[00:56:48.865 --> 00:56:56.889]  The nice suit, the nice hair, the nice tie, the nice voice, the good-looking man or woman you can trust telling you to tell a prompter.
[00:56:57.170 --> 00:56:58.951]  That's what the devil looks like, okay?
[00:57:00.191 --> 00:57:01.112]  That's what the devil looks like.
[00:57:01.152 --> 00:57:05.214]  He doesn't look like Anton LaVey, some bald-headed freak dancing around in red pajamas.
[00:57:07.992 --> 00:57:09.753]  The devil looks like the UN.
[00:57:09.773 --> 00:57:11.153]  The devil looks like the Congress.
[00:57:11.434 --> 00:57:15.655]  The devil, you know, the Antichrist is going to be, people are going to think he's Jesus, folks.
[00:57:16.016 --> 00:57:19.017]  Because he doesn't show up in a red outfit, people are going to buy him.
[00:57:19.177 --> 00:57:20.638]  They already got people on national TV.
[00:57:20.678 --> 00:57:22.418]  You know, if you're a Christian, take the chip.
[00:57:22.458 --> 00:57:23.719]  We've confirmed they're doing that now.
[00:57:24.579 --> 00:57:28.201]  So, the devil looks like a face-scanning camera.
[00:57:28.241 --> 00:57:30.082]  The devil looks like a compact city.
[00:57:30.322 --> 00:57:31.983]  The devil looks like open borders.
[00:57:33.483 --> 00:57:35.244]  The devil looks like world government.
[00:57:35.284 --> 00:57:36.985]  The devil looks like Thomas Barnett.
[00:57:38.274 --> 00:57:46.058]  Up there real slick and real smooth and real calm with the right tones to not upset you and soothe you and just relax.
[00:57:46.418 --> 00:57:47.559]  Just let us run things.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:52.962]  And Halloween, always the murders increase, the abductions increase of children.
[00:57:53.342 --> 00:57:59.185]  Devil's Night in Detroit, hundreds of homes burned each year until the citizens got together en masse and called it Angel's Night.
[00:57:59.586 --> 00:58:03.748]  And they went out and confronted and the crime rate went down by several thousand percent.
[00:58:04.368 --> 00:58:05.929]  We should call it Hero's Night.
[00:58:06.992 --> 00:58:12.256]  I heard Pastor Dart on the air.
[00:58:14.558 --> 00:58:15.979]  It's a good point he made last night.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.561]  I was listening to it on WOAI.
[00:58:18.562 --> 00:58:21.364]  That's what we need to do is give on Halloween.
[00:58:21.904 --> 00:58:27.369]  It teaches your children to go demand something dressed up like a demon at somebody's door.
[00:58:28.049 --> 00:58:29.090]  Demanding bounty.
[00:58:29.411 --> 00:58:32.273]  Doing what Druid Priest did thousands of years ago.
[00:58:33.594 --> 00:58:34.655]  Let me tell you, folks...
[00:58:35.567 --> 00:58:37.689]  You curse your children when you do that.
[00:58:38.289 --> 00:58:39.470]  You curse them.
[00:58:41.411 --> 00:58:46.315]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNlive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:57.974]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.634 --> 00:58:59.715]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.416 --> 00:59:01.517]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.157 --> 00:59:02.998]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.738 --> 00:59:05.660]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:09.263]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.503 --> 00:59:13.646]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:19.771]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:19.851 --> 00:59:20.432]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:20.452 --> 00:59:21.733]  Central Standard Time.
[00:59:21.753 --> 00:59:22.554]  We're here live.
[00:59:22.574 --> 00:59:23.915]  Abe and Bob.
[00:59:24.782 --> 00:59:25.763]  Others, your calls are coming up.
[00:59:25.783 --> 00:59:27.164]  We've got Tex Mars joining us.
[00:59:27.184 --> 00:59:30.867]  We have Barbara Lee Fisher cutting up the Vaccine Awareness Network.
[00:59:31.347 --> 00:59:32.548]  Very serious laws.
[00:59:33.589 --> 00:59:43.156]  Very close to passing for total vaccine maker liability protection and forced inoculation and federalization under local towns and cities for forced inoculation.
[00:59:44.637 --> 00:59:45.258]  That's coming up.
[00:59:45.278 --> 00:59:46.999]  We'll be talking about Halloween here in a few minutes.
[00:59:47.680 --> 00:59:50.102]  Let's go ahead and talk to Abe in Florida.
[00:59:50.282 --> 00:59:51.082]  Abe, you're on the air.
[00:59:51.583 --> 00:59:52.483]  Hey, Mr. Jones.
[00:59:52.563 --> 00:59:53.724]  I'm in full support of your work.
[00:59:54.085 --> 00:59:54.425]  Thank you.
[00:59:55.739 --> 00:59:57.960]  I just wanted to touch on a few points.
[00:59:59.321 --> 01:00:04.005]  The last week I was flipping through television and just seeing what was on.
[01:00:05.205 --> 01:00:17.054]  MTV, the wasteland that it is, there's a show called Punk whereby they stimulate an environment to try to create a stimulus from popular celebrities.
[01:00:17.094 --> 01:00:18.435]  The show host, Ashton Kutcher,
[01:00:18.993 --> 01:00:29.199]  He just blatantly put out there, and I'm sure some of your viewers might have seen it, but he just blatantly put ID cards.
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:30.760]  We're in the future.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:37.564]  Where's my card where I could just immediately go to the bank or just get money out?
[01:00:39.344 --> 01:00:41.605]  Yeah, it's all very overt.
[01:00:42.146 --> 01:00:43.606]  Oh, we're all going to have chips.
[01:00:43.826 --> 01:00:44.887]  Oh, we're all going to have cards.
[01:00:45.007 --> 01:00:45.788]  Oh, it's good.
[01:00:46.128 --> 01:00:49.930]  And it doesn't matter if 90 plus percent of us are against it in major polls.
[01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:53.091]  They'll keep repeating and repeating and repeating and repeating.
[01:00:54.525 --> 01:00:57.107]  Well, that's just how you, you know, say domesticate a wild horse.
[01:00:57.487 --> 01:01:03.191]  You just keep getting in the pen with it over and over and over again until it just gets used to you and accustomed to you.
[01:01:03.431 --> 01:01:09.775]  We have to consciously realize how they're manipulating us and be insulted by it and resist it.
[01:01:10.475 --> 01:01:11.056]  Right, right.
[01:01:11.396 --> 01:01:16.239]  But do you think at this point that we could just reach the mass of Americans?
[01:01:16.279 --> 01:01:22.363]  Because, I mean, I'm a college student myself, and when I talk to, you know, fellow college students, they're just,
[01:01:22.813 --> 01:01:28.136]  They're completely oblivious to the fact that life isn't just what it teaches you in school.
[01:01:29.157 --> 01:01:40.664]  In the new world, they just have no comprehension of... A lot of that is because we've been trained to, number one, be soft, and to be lazy, and to be self-centered, and to only feed our animal instincts.
[01:01:40.744 --> 01:01:42.705]  But they're not going to be satisfied.
[01:01:42.725 --> 01:01:43.825]  That's never satisfying.
[01:01:44.146 --> 01:01:46.147]  They're going to want the higher levels of understanding.
[01:01:48.829 --> 01:01:54.593]  And they're going to be abused by this system, so plant the seeds and know that they will sprout.
[01:01:54.934 --> 01:01:57.215]  And it's never been a majority that changed things, sir.
[01:01:57.596 --> 01:02:00.378]  We already have well more than what our founding fathers had at 5%.
[01:02:00.538 --> 01:02:00.778]  Oh, okay.
[01:02:00.818 --> 01:02:18.131]  Yeah, I was also watching the Simpsons last night, and when you spoke about how they're trying to reach you on television, it was just so weird when you spoke about it, and then I thought to myself,
[01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:21.482]  They showed guns being destroyed, homework destroyed.
[01:02:21.862 --> 01:02:26.065]  You know, he asked them copy, and they tried to, you know, just play it down because it's a cartoon.
[01:02:26.525 --> 01:02:29.627]  They showed guns being destroyed and then a nuclear bomb going off.
[01:02:30.127 --> 01:02:32.428]  And then right after that, I was like, oh, my gosh.
[01:02:32.448 --> 01:02:36.711]  You know, that's just crazy how they just, you know, blatantly put that out.
[01:02:36.731 --> 01:02:41.314]  Well, not blatantly, but indirectly put it in the cartoon.
[01:02:41.434 --> 01:02:43.275]  It's called operant conditioning.
[01:02:43.875 --> 01:02:44.596]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:44.716 --> 01:02:45.957]  And, David, I know you don't...
[01:02:46.690 --> 01:02:49.451]  Completely agree with some of his stuff, and it is truly bizarre.
[01:02:49.931 --> 01:02:54.552]  But the Secrets of the Matrix, he said that these people are targeting the unconscious part of the brain.
[01:02:54.592 --> 01:02:56.673]  Well, that's Edward Bernays.
[01:02:56.693 --> 01:02:57.613]  That's mainstream.
[01:02:57.813 --> 01:02:58.493]  Thanks for the call.
[01:02:58.993 --> 01:03:08.496]  See, what David does, and I think David's a nice guy, is he talks about all this real stuff, then he adds things to it that can't be proven, and hence, then people think all the proven stuff may not be true.
[01:03:09.956 --> 01:03:16.478]  When you take a mid-level advertising class at a good university, this is openly taught
[01:03:17.162 --> 01:03:25.526]  Okay, the conscious mind is up here in the cerebral cortex, but the subconscious brain catalogs and is hooked into the instincts and everything.
[01:03:26.207 --> 01:03:28.888]  And that's what's being hit.
[01:03:29.969 --> 01:03:33.150]  That's why it's good to not watch a lot of TV or be very selective about it.
[01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:41.535]  I mean, even if I try to watch a show about dolphins, at the end it's give up all your property, world government's good, the animals are dying.
[01:03:42.315 --> 01:03:43.836]  Everything has the propaganda in it.
[01:03:44.409 --> 01:03:45.549]  And there's subliminals, too.
[01:03:45.789 --> 01:03:46.570]  I mean, big time.
[01:03:47.230 --> 01:03:49.010]  By the way, subliminals are public.
[01:03:49.311 --> 01:03:52.672]  That's not a... The industry will admit that if you just read about it.
[01:03:54.252 --> 01:03:57.113]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.353 --> 01:03:58.073]  Hello, my friends.
[01:03:58.153 --> 01:03:58.933]  Alex Jones here.

[01:04:04.295 --> 01:04:08.736]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.156 --> 01:04:13.358]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:14.138]  The Constitution
[01:04:14.478 --> 01:04:21.141]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:04:21.341 --> 01:04:25.762]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:04:25.982 --> 01:04:33.205]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that is sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:04:33.465 --> 01:04:35.886]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.

[01:05:54.036 --> 01:05:57.917]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:05:58.057 --> 01:05:59.797]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:05:59.877 --> 01:06:01.138]  But not just any water.
[01:06:01.218 --> 01:06:05.419]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[01:06:05.499 --> 01:06:15.181]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[01:06:15.441 --> 01:06:16.082]  We're good to go.
[01:06:30.438 --> 01:06:30.758]  That's 1-866-884-9104
[01:06:54.230 --> 01:07:00.255]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.855 --> 01:07:03.897]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:15.566 --> 01:07:18.008]  Alright, we have Texas Mars on the line with us.
[01:07:18.028 --> 01:07:22.491]  We'll be going to my good friend, the professor, here in just a moment to give you the history of Halloween.
[01:07:23.863 --> 01:07:41.407]  But just to recap, Hugo Chavez, the president of Venezuela, who is supposedly a socialist, but he took land taken by neocon governments in the past and gave it back to the indigenous population with the deeds.
[01:07:42.367 --> 01:07:53.489]  So our government, the Supreme Court, is ruling that we don't own private property and if some private robber baron wants it, they can come and take it and not even pay you fair market value.
[01:07:54.346 --> 01:08:03.093]  That's literally like feudal lords 800 years ago in ancient England in the days of Longshanks just saying, I want your property.
[01:08:03.193 --> 01:08:04.134]  I want your wife.
[01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:05.555]  I want your daughter.
[01:08:05.635 --> 01:08:08.758]  I'm taking your sons as slaves to serve in my military.
[01:08:10.279 --> 01:08:12.501]  I mean, that's slavery, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:12.541 --> 01:08:15.283]  We forget that it isn't just black Americans who were slaves.
[01:08:15.343 --> 01:08:22.929]  A lot of white people came here as indentured servants, and you never got out of your seven years of indentured servitude because they'd get you into debt and you'd be a sharecropper.
[01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:28.050]  But that's a side issue with Hugo Chavez.
[01:08:31.451 --> 01:08:47.258]  The point is, he's getting off the IMF and World Bank, he's getting out of the system, he's got his own oil, and now he's saying that our government is satanic, that this is a way to terrorize the public, that dressing up like demons is bad, and that it's not our way, that it's not Christian.
[01:08:48.425 --> 01:08:50.126]  And I have a lady that cleans our house.
[01:08:50.546 --> 01:08:52.828]  Because I'm too busy, my wife's too busy working all the time to do it.
[01:08:53.068 --> 01:08:55.609]  And she's got her green card, folks.
[01:08:55.649 --> 01:08:56.810]  Don't worry, I don't hire illegals.
[01:08:57.170 --> 01:08:58.451]  Really sweet, nice lady.
[01:09:00.152 --> 01:09:03.534]  And she's from Brazil.
[01:09:04.794 --> 01:09:08.397]  And I was talking to her last week, and I said, oh, Halloween's coming up.
[01:09:08.457 --> 01:09:11.298]  And she said, oh, no, we don't celebrate that.
[01:09:11.358 --> 01:09:12.139]  That is Diablo.
[01:09:12.159 --> 01:09:13.560]  And I said, oh, really?
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:15.000]  She goes, yes, it's a festival of the devil.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:15.941]  We don't worship the devil.
[01:09:16.474 --> 01:09:18.717]  And I said, oh, I don't worship the devil either.
[01:09:18.757 --> 01:09:20.299]  We don't celebrate that.
[01:09:20.339 --> 01:09:23.043]  So there's a lot of things down in Latin America.
[01:09:23.083 --> 01:09:28.190]  Now, in Mexico they do, folks, and they've got the Day of the Dead and all that because you've got that whole Aztec influence.
[01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:31.294]  But not in South America, folks, not in Central America.
[01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:41.788]  And BBC admits, quote, Halloween, a pagan festival characterized by mischief-making, is marked every year on October 31st of October.
[01:09:42.208 --> 01:09:49.614]  And it is the year... Halloween has the most murders and abductions and most violence of any day in the year.
[01:09:51.015 --> 01:09:58.721]  And what it's number three for DWIs, what Thanksgiving is number one and number two is...
[01:10:00.652 --> 01:10:01.632]  Number two is New Year's.
[01:10:01.672 --> 01:10:05.853]  But the point is, hundreds of homes burned down in Detroit on Devil's Night.
[01:10:07.593 --> 01:10:09.934]  Why would you let your children be part of this?
[01:10:09.994 --> 01:10:29.277]  Even if you don't believe in God, which I think is foolish, you should know, folks, having your child dress up in an outfit and go demand something from someone, that's what the Druid priest would come and demand your horse, demand your oxen, demand your cat, demand your child, to burn them, to kill them, to slit their throats, to throw them in a peat bog.
[01:10:30.546 --> 01:10:32.427]  Were we able to get Tex on a better phone there, guys?
[01:10:35.307 --> 01:10:35.808]  Okay, good.
[01:10:36.008 --> 01:10:37.108]  I was waiting for the cue on that.
[01:10:38.288 --> 01:10:42.170]  So honored to have Tex Mars, powerofprophecy.com.
[01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:48.271]  Of course, texmars.com and conspiracyworld.com.
[01:10:49.032 --> 01:10:51.372]  Best-selling author, Air Force officer.
[01:10:51.853 --> 01:10:53.813]  He married my wife and I. Good friend of mine.
[01:10:53.873 --> 01:10:54.894]  Always good to have him back up.
[01:10:55.474 --> 01:10:57.694]  And Tex, thank you for coming on with us today.
[01:10:58.175 --> 01:10:58.635]  Hey, Alex.
[01:10:58.715 --> 01:10:59.555]  Great to be with you.
[01:11:01.286 --> 01:11:06.887]  Halloween, Tex, why should we not celebrate Halloween?
[01:11:06.927 --> 01:11:10.168]  Why should we keep our children out of Samhain or Samhain?
[01:11:11.168 --> 01:11:17.590]  Well, you mentioned the Samhain or Samhain as many call it.
[01:11:18.810 --> 01:11:29.413]  First of all, Alex, we're not against at all kids having a good time or parents having a good time or even though it's probably not the
[01:11:30.137 --> 01:11:35.141]  Most healthy, eating a lot of sweets at a given time of year.
[01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:39.205]  I think I've eaten too many sweets and it's put a lot of pounds on me over the years.
[01:11:40.106 --> 01:11:42.908]  But here is the absolute truth of Halloween.
[01:11:43.829 --> 01:11:47.472]  It has always been a satanic day.
[01:11:48.153 --> 01:11:49.334]  It is a witchcraft day.
[01:11:49.814 --> 01:11:54.198]  You know, in the witchcraft calendar, there are eight Sabbats.
[01:11:55.459 --> 01:11:57.081]  The second...
[01:11:58.232 --> 01:12:01.275]  Most powerful day of witchcraft for all witches.
[01:12:02.616 --> 01:12:09.641]  And you can talk to the head of the Church of Wicca or the Salem Witchcraft Sect and all of those.
[01:12:10.222 --> 01:12:13.224]  But the second most important day is this day, Halloween.
[01:12:14.345 --> 01:12:16.747]  And it comes, of course, from pagan sources.
[01:12:16.787 --> 01:12:24.814]  It really was not practiced in the United States until 1845 when many people from Ireland and Scotland came over after the
[01:12:25.427 --> 01:12:28.087]  The horrible potato famine.
[01:12:29.308 --> 01:12:31.388]  So many immigrants came to the United States from Ireland.
[01:12:31.768 --> 01:12:34.529]  Unfortunately, they brought with them the worship of the Druids.
[01:12:34.569 --> 01:12:37.129]  At least a certain number did.
[01:12:37.649 --> 01:12:42.490]  It caught on and now has become a major holiday in the United States.
[01:12:42.530 --> 01:12:44.310]  But it is the worship of the dead.
[01:12:44.970 --> 01:12:46.311]  It is necromancy.
[01:12:46.411 --> 01:12:48.411]  It is affiliation with spirits.
[01:12:48.471 --> 01:12:52.592]  Now, I know that most parents out there are probably saying, oh, this is crazy.
[01:12:53.212 --> 01:12:54.632]  It's just a fun day.
[01:12:55.498 --> 01:13:02.585]  But we're not talking about dressing up just in costumes as historical figures or such.
[01:13:02.625 --> 01:13:04.347]  We're talking about devils.
[01:13:04.487 --> 01:13:06.148]  We're talking about witchcraft.
[01:13:07.049 --> 01:13:15.217]  We're talking about Dracula, vampirism, and all of these things which, Alex, are based on reality.
[01:13:15.818 --> 01:13:17.259]  They are not based on myth.
[01:13:17.299 --> 01:13:18.821]  They are not based on cartoons.
[01:13:19.625 --> 01:13:21.166]  They're based on real things.
[01:13:21.646 --> 01:13:28.871]  Well, Tex, as you know, every couple weeks I see where some teenagers kidnap an old woman and cut her head off and drink her blood.
[01:13:29.411 --> 01:13:31.153]  I mean, it's exploding.
[01:13:31.233 --> 01:13:32.514]  Murders are exploding.
[01:13:33.134 --> 01:13:34.795]  These vampiric murders.
[01:13:34.855 --> 01:13:41.379]  Of course, they're not physical, live forever vampires, but that's where the legends come from are these murdering death cults.
[01:13:42.300 --> 01:13:43.861]  Well, Jeffrey Dahmer, that's what he did.
[01:13:43.901 --> 01:13:45.322]  He started out in the occult.
[01:13:45.702 --> 01:13:48.224]  He began to kill animals, you know, dogs and cats.
[01:13:48.826 --> 01:13:50.446]  He graduated up to human beings.
[01:13:50.506 --> 01:13:51.447]  He was an occultist.
[01:13:51.487 --> 01:13:53.227]  He was a Satan worshiper.
[01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:56.288]  And then he began to be a cannibal even.
[01:13:56.908 --> 01:14:08.591]  And in fact, you know, Julius Caesar saw what we would call Halloween being celebrated when he conquered the Gallic lands and went over into Scotland.
[01:14:09.051 --> 01:14:12.292]  He saw the Stonehenge type of celebrations.
[01:14:12.792 --> 01:14:16.973]  He said himself that the Druids practiced not only witchcraft, this is in the writings
[01:14:17.483 --> 01:14:18.444]  Of Julius Caesar.
[01:14:18.624 --> 01:14:23.666]  No, I actually own a volume of his letters back to Rome, and he goes, these people are just total heathen.
[01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:33.091]  This is a worshiper of Mars, and a worshiper of Zeus, and a worshiper of all these pagan gods, and he's calling it evil.
[01:14:35.091 --> 01:14:35.612]  That's right.
[01:14:35.792 --> 01:14:44.476]  Well, at least they didn't... One of the things he noted was that they would sacrifice victims to their so-called gods, and then their high priest, the Druid priest,
[01:14:45.239 --> 01:14:48.401]  Would eat the flesh of their victims.
[01:14:48.821 --> 01:14:52.803]  So this was just a bore to Julius Caesar and to the Romans.
[01:14:54.064 --> 01:14:55.344]  But I believe this happens now.
[01:14:55.384 --> 01:15:07.631]  You know, I had a call some years ago from a policeman in San Antonio, and he wanted to find out more about Halloween and what witchcraft folks do and Satanists.
[01:15:08.251 --> 01:15:14.254]  And he told me that throughout the city of San Antonio, in the environs, in the wooded areas, in the hill country,
[01:15:14.830 --> 01:15:23.534]  They find satanic altars after Halloween, and they actually find the bones and charred bodies of animals.
[01:15:25.055 --> 01:15:28.256]  So this is something that they wanted to try to put an end to.
[01:15:28.396 --> 01:15:38.640]  Tex, I personally found that hiking around in the hill country around Austin, because I'll go on 10-15 mile hikes, especially back in the day when I had time, and you will run into satanic altars.
[01:15:39.941 --> 01:15:40.521]  You do indeed.
[01:15:40.761 --> 01:15:44.143]  I have a picture coming up in one of my newsletters, Alex.
[01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:45.950]  Of Liz Carpenter.
[01:15:46.711 --> 01:15:50.832]  Now remember, she was the personal secretary to Lady Bird Johnson.
[01:15:51.612 --> 01:15:56.654]  She's big in Democratic Party politics, and when Hillary Clinton came to town, you know, they met.
[01:15:57.515 --> 01:16:02.236]  But actually, a picture of her howling at the moon.
[01:16:02.696 --> 01:16:08.238]  It said that she and other feminists, on the night of the full moon, go out and howl at the moon.
[01:16:09.379 --> 01:16:12.140]  This is in witchcraft called drawing down the moon.
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:13.060]  Here we have
[01:16:13.553 --> 01:16:25.776]  Probably the most famous woman in Texas politics, Liz Carpenter, howling at the moon out in the hill country, along with her liberal, democratic, feminist friends.
[01:16:25.936 --> 01:16:26.957]  And I interrupted you.
[01:16:27.197 --> 01:16:28.377]  Back to the police officer.
[01:16:28.397 --> 01:16:32.078]  He was calling about all these altars everywhere.
[01:16:32.758 --> 01:16:35.659]  Yeah, and he told me at that time, but this was several years back,
[01:16:36.385 --> 01:16:51.236]  That a number of the Humane Society shelters and such in the Central Texas area, especially in San Antonio, at that time, they put a prohibition against the adopting of cats, especially black cats.
[01:16:52.361 --> 01:16:54.301]  And this is across America.
[01:16:54.401 --> 01:17:05.863]  The ASPCA and Humane Society actually know that many witchcraft sects will go and adopt animals, especially black cats, and then sacrifice them.
[01:17:05.903 --> 01:17:08.764]  So this is not just fun and games.
[01:17:08.864 --> 01:17:10.864]  These people take it seriously.
[01:17:10.884 --> 01:17:14.705]  Let me say one other thing, Alex, for people that are scratching their heads right now.
[01:17:15.385 --> 01:17:17.465]  You have exposed the Bohemian Grove.
[01:17:18.506 --> 01:17:20.346]  And what is the Bohemian Grove
[01:17:20.785 --> 01:17:22.006]  But a meeting in the forest.
[01:17:22.026 --> 01:17:24.587]  This is the same thing the Druid priest and the others did.
[01:17:25.387 --> 01:17:32.050]  And they worshipped the great fire god and they made human sacrifice or at least had an effigy that appeared.
[01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:41.554]  So we're talking about the top politicians in America, Europe and the world that meet annually deep in a grove in California.
[01:17:41.614 --> 01:17:42.434]  You have outed this.
[01:17:42.474 --> 01:17:43.875]  You were the first one to do so.
[01:17:44.415 --> 01:17:46.276]  This is nothing more than satanic.
[01:17:46.716 --> 01:17:48.497]  Halloween is a reflection
[01:17:49.039 --> 01:17:50.980]  Of what you found at the Bohemian Grove.
[01:17:52.521 --> 01:17:56.562]  Well, Tex, I mean, look at how the violence and the murder explodes on this night.
[01:17:57.703 --> 01:18:04.786]  Well, yeah, they said that already, even here in Austin, Texas, I think 250 arrests they announced last night already.
[01:18:04.846 --> 01:18:08.948]  We haven't even had the big celebration of Halloween.
[01:18:08.968 --> 01:18:14.110]  They've already gotten 250 arrests, mostly for alcohol and so forth.
[01:18:14.210 --> 01:18:15.911]  But you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:18:16.610 --> 01:18:17.411]  Well, you do.
[01:18:17.591 --> 01:18:25.878]  And, you know, not too long ago, a mother wrote to me, sent me a news clipping.
[01:18:25.898 --> 01:18:27.499]  Maybe we can talk more about this on the break.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:28.741]  Let's talk about it on the other side.
[01:18:28.761 --> 01:18:30.462]  And then maybe get a little bit into Christmas.
[01:18:30.482 --> 01:18:31.743]  See, now it's not Jesus.
[01:18:32.204 --> 01:18:33.665]  Now it's a jolly elf.
[01:18:34.548 --> 01:18:43.796]  For those who don't know, Christmas was actually banned for about 20 years in England in the early 1800s because of mass murder and killing.
[01:18:44.836 --> 01:18:47.238]  Yeah, Santa Claus isn't a very friendly fellow.
[01:18:47.779 --> 01:18:49.280]  He's actually kind of like Freddy Krueger.
[01:18:53.664 --> 01:18:55.685]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[01:18:56.266 --> 01:18:57.667]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[01:18:58.568 --> 01:19:02.291]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, A Second Look at the Federal Reserve...
[01:19:03.041 --> 01:19:09.071]  I said we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[01:19:09.631 --> 01:19:12.155]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[01:19:13.057 --> 01:19:17.624]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[01:19:18.211 --> 01:19:22.932]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[01:19:23.472 --> 01:19:42.098]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.libertydollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.

[01:20:52.725 --> 01:20:53.506]  Attention drivers.
[01:20:53.827 --> 01:20:56.350]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[01:20:56.671 --> 01:20:59.975]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[01:21:00.296 --> 01:21:05.162]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents in fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[01:21:05.523 --> 01:21:09.188]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[01:21:09.588 --> 01:21:10.649]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:13.951]  Poor mileage and reduced performance in a time of record fuel prices.
[01:21:14.272 --> 01:21:14.912]  There is an answer.
[01:21:15.192 --> 01:21:21.317]  Protecta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.
[01:21:21.577 --> 01:21:28.282]  Plus, a special mileage improver designed and fleet tested by a major oil company to improve mileage even on new cars by up to 4%.
[01:21:28.983 --> 01:21:31.205]  The mileage improvement lasts for an entire oil change.
[01:21:31.505 --> 01:21:35.468]  So quit wasting unburned fuel and get more when you treat your car right with Protecta.

[01:21:45.696 --> 01:21:45.976]  That's 888-873-7371.
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:53.581]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[01:21:53.661 --> 01:21:58.444]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[01:21:58.605 --> 01:22:06.410]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[01:22:06.671 --> 01:22:12.055]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[01:22:12.255 --> 01:22:19.240]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:20.421]  We're good to go.
[01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:21.001]  We're good to go.
[01:22:38.050 --> 01:22:39.671]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:39.691 --> 01:22:42.153]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:03.159 --> 01:23:08.742]  I tell you, with guests like Tex Myers, we always have the best radio off air during the last four minutes talking to Tex.
[01:23:09.182 --> 01:23:11.503]  I was mentioning my new film, The Order of Death, that's coming out.
[01:23:12.343 --> 01:23:16.585]  It's going to be put on at the same video, same DVD as Dark Singers Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:23:16.605 --> 01:23:17.986]  It'll be available in about two, three weeks.
[01:23:18.624 --> 01:23:25.468]  But how the local pagans didn't like me mentioning how the elite was doing rituals.
[01:23:25.488 --> 01:23:27.529]  They were just mad about the policies.
[01:23:28.069 --> 01:23:34.473]  And how a year after we snuck in, we caught video of them, when Ed Holman went out there, doing their own ritual at the gates of the grove.
[01:23:34.493 --> 01:23:37.414]  And one of them called in Amon.
[01:23:37.434 --> 01:23:38.315]  They said, Amon.
[01:23:39.055 --> 01:23:45.198]  And then I knew it was Egyptian, but text just said that it corresponds to the Canaanite Moloch.
[01:23:45.679 --> 01:23:48.080]  So text, I tell you, it just never ends, does it?
[01:23:48.655 --> 01:23:52.417]  Well, it really does, and it's very interesting, the connection there.
[01:23:52.857 --> 01:23:54.638]  But again, we get back to the Bohemian Grove.
[01:23:54.798 --> 01:24:02.062]  There's so much in the Old Testament, God warning about those who went to the groves and worshipped their gods.
[01:24:03.243 --> 01:24:16.450]  You know, talk about these pagans who were demonstrating against your exposures, and they don't like to be exposed because they get good press coverage on Halloween in the mainline media, you see.
[01:24:17.125 --> 01:24:19.867]  So they don't like it when an Alex Jones or Tex Morris comes up.
[01:24:20.227 --> 01:24:30.032]  I was in Seattle on King TV some years ago and they had a big town meeting there and they had all the witches come out to debate me.
[01:24:30.453 --> 01:24:32.374]  And I was about the only Christian in the audience.
[01:24:33.514 --> 01:24:34.195]  And there I was.
[01:24:34.215 --> 01:24:40.538]  It was sort of like an Oprah Winfrey show except everybody was hostile against the Christians.
[01:24:41.259 --> 01:24:43.540]  But one of the witches got up and she talked about
[01:24:44.016 --> 01:24:45.217]  How terrible it was.
[01:24:45.337 --> 01:24:47.438]  This is, by the way, during Halloween period.
[01:24:47.959 --> 01:24:49.880]  She said how terrible the Christians were.
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:52.402]  They've always persecuted witches.
[01:24:52.462 --> 01:24:55.324]  And she said they accuse us of worshipping Satan.
[01:24:55.824 --> 01:24:58.386]  Why, we don't even believe in the devil and witchcraft.
[01:24:58.406 --> 01:25:00.387]  The devil is a Christian invention.
[01:25:01.128 --> 01:25:06.531]  So the host came to me and stuck the microphone in my face, Alex, and said, what about that?
[01:25:06.571 --> 01:25:08.252]  The witches say they don't worship the devil.
[01:25:08.973 --> 01:25:10.434]  And I looked right at this witch.
[01:25:11.733 --> 01:25:15.415]  And I said, you worship the goddess, do you not?
[01:25:15.635 --> 01:25:18.658]  She said, yes, I worship the lady of the forest.
[01:25:19.198 --> 01:25:24.762]  And I said, and you worship the consort, the male, which is Pan, right?
[01:25:24.802 --> 01:25:26.043]  The horned god.
[01:25:26.824 --> 01:25:31.287]  She said, yes, but she began to stammer, actually stammer, you know.
[01:25:31.708 --> 01:25:35.751]  She said, but Pan, the horned god we worship, that's not Satan.
[01:25:37.112 --> 01:25:38.353]  He's the god of the forest.
[01:25:38.633 --> 01:25:39.814]  I said, and he has horns.
[01:25:40.856 --> 01:25:43.057]  She says, well, yes, but that's not the devil.
[01:25:43.797 --> 01:25:49.039]  So I think it's interesting how they try to define their own terms as they would like to do it.
[01:25:49.679 --> 01:25:52.640]  You know, I have an interesting fact here, Alex, for your audience.
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:56.581]  A lot of kids dress up as Dracula, Count Dracula.
[01:25:57.441 --> 01:26:01.503]  And, you know, Sesame Street, one of the characters is a count like Dracula.
[01:26:01.803 --> 01:26:05.964]  I notice even cereal is called Count Chocula, after chocolate.
[01:26:07.317 --> 01:26:12.782]  But people don't realize there literally was a real Dracula.
[01:26:13.002 --> 01:26:14.743]  And Bush and Kerry are related to him.
[01:26:16.045 --> 01:26:16.885]  I have heard that.
[01:26:16.905 --> 01:26:18.487]  That's actually been proven.
[01:26:18.947 --> 01:26:20.729]  MSNBC did the genealogy.
[01:26:21.329 --> 01:26:22.671]  Well, this is an interesting thing.
[01:26:22.711 --> 01:26:31.699]  Now, there's a book, and I had a copy of it some years ago, and I went out and did research, and it's on a ruler in Eastern Europe named Vlad, V-L-A-D,
[01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:33.653]  The Impaler.
[01:26:33.974 --> 01:26:35.634]  Yeah, Vlad the Dragon, the Impaler.
[01:26:36.055 --> 01:26:38.516]  Yeah, and he killed over 100,000 people.
[01:26:38.556 --> 01:26:40.057]  He was ruler of a small nation.
[01:26:41.217 --> 01:26:42.638]  And he tortured them.
[01:26:42.678 --> 01:26:44.619]  He would impale their bodies on spears.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:47.841]  He literally would drink blood.
[01:26:48.581 --> 01:26:48.781]  Over 100,000.
[01:26:49.221 --> 01:26:54.644]  He locked many of them into a palace and burned them alive.
[01:26:55.965 --> 01:26:57.826]  That's how he got rid of the beggars and the homeless.
[01:26:57.866 --> 01:27:00.067]  He just locked them up and burned them alive.
[01:27:01.648 --> 01:27:10.413]  But this was a real character, so when you play around with Dracula, you're really, you know, imitating a real character.
[01:27:10.673 --> 01:27:14.295]  Well, I see people dressed up like Jeffrey Dahmer or Ted Bundy.
[01:27:14.355 --> 01:27:15.516]  It's like it's real funny.
[01:27:16.517 --> 01:27:17.477]  Oh, yeah, exactly.
[01:27:17.517 --> 01:27:29.704]  Well, you know, I think it was Jason, or no, Freddy Krueger, in one of the movies, he actually said he studied the life of Ted Bundy and used that as an inspiration for
[01:27:30.350 --> 01:27:33.273]  Or how he, his mannerisms and such, and how he acted.
[01:27:33.293 --> 01:27:46.384]  You know, back to Vlad, the impaler, it's interesting that Lenin, you know, was not the monster of the Red Terror who murdered so many Christians and others in Soviet Russia.
[01:27:47.745 --> 01:27:49.667]  His first name was Vladimir.
[01:27:50.487 --> 01:27:51.268]  He named himself.
[01:27:51.288 --> 01:27:52.529]  That was not his real name.
[01:27:52.890 --> 01:27:54.010]  He was born with another name.
[01:27:54.471 --> 01:27:57.994]  But he named himself Vladimir, after Vlad.
[01:27:58.863 --> 01:28:08.309]  And it may even be of interest to people that Putin, the current, you know, he was with the KGB, and now he's the new dictator, basically, of Russia.
[01:28:09.029 --> 01:28:11.991]  And his name is Vladimir Putin.
[01:28:12.411 --> 01:28:16.454]  Well, we know that they were called the Red Terror, the Red Star, and it's actually talked about.
[01:28:16.494 --> 01:28:21.177]  This is well documented, where they're killing all these people, and he goes, I need more, more blood!
[01:28:21.677 --> 01:28:22.338]  More blood.
[01:28:22.378 --> 01:28:23.798]  He literally called out for that.
[01:28:24.479 --> 01:28:27.681]  And May 1 is the highest holy day in witchcraft.
[01:28:28.323 --> 01:28:31.727]  And that was the day they celebrated the coming of communism.
[01:28:32.067 --> 01:28:33.048]  May 1, May Day.
[01:28:33.428 --> 01:28:35.611]  May Day, how cute!
[01:28:36.371 --> 01:28:37.212]  It's friendly.
[01:28:37.252 --> 01:28:40.596]  We'll be right back with Tex Mars, more about Halloween, more about his new book, too.
[01:28:43.459 --> 01:28:44.380]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.462]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.363 --> 01:28:50.046]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.948 --> 01:29:00.292]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:00.513 --> 01:29:05.536]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:05.856 --> 01:29:13.762]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:13.922 --> 01:29:20.967]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:21.167 --> 01:29:22.387]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:22.528 --> 01:29:25.929]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[01:29:25.969 --> 01:29:27.109]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[01:29:27.389 --> 01:29:28.670]  Eliminate the cause.
[01:29:28.870 --> 01:29:35.692]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[01:29:35.812 --> 01:29:38.253]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.

[01:29:41.454 --> 01:29:42.415]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:29:53.422 --> 01:30:01.688]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[01:30:01.949 --> 01:30:06.292]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[01:30:06.592 --> 01:30:15.499]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[01:30:15.719 --> 01:30:19.322]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[01:30:19.622 --> 01:30:24.643]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[01:30:24.943 --> 01:30:31.665]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[01:30:32.145 --> 01:30:32.805]  What about you?
[01:30:33.466 --> 01:30:38.807]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[01:30:54.582 --> 01:30:56.183]  Government is best which governs these.
[01:30:56.723 --> 01:30:58.044]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[01:30:58.485 --> 01:31:01.186]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:31:01.627 --> 01:31:04.288]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:31:04.729 --> 01:31:11.193]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[01:31:11.513 --> 01:31:18.918]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at libertystickers.com.

[01:31:44.728 --> 01:31:45.769]  Perhaps Jenna Bush.
[01:31:46.329 --> 01:31:47.549]  Osama been forgotten.

[01:31:51.691 --> 01:32:02.897]  I got a star on my car and one on my chest.
[01:32:03.457 --> 01:32:04.438]  A gun on my hip.
[01:32:04.458 --> 01:32:07.339]  Tex Mars is going to be with us about 15 minutes in the next hour.
[01:32:07.359 --> 01:32:08.340]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:32:08.860 --> 01:32:10.000]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:32:15.638 --> 01:32:26.288]  Tex, before we go any further, give us some of your websites and tell us about your amazingly powerful newsletter and also your new book, Codex Magica.
[01:32:27.529 --> 01:32:32.454]  Well, Alex, I'll tell you, that book, wow, it's going to be a very controversial book.
[01:32:33.835 --> 01:32:40.702]  It's going to be out November 1st, and I understand you're going to be offering it on your program on Infowars.com, your website.
[01:32:41.414 --> 01:32:44.897]  And I'll tell you, people will have never seen a book like this.
[01:32:44.957 --> 01:32:46.898]  It's over 600 pages.
[01:32:47.539 --> 01:32:49.860]  It seems to be about two inches thick.
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:51.962]  It's really an encyclopedia.
[01:32:52.522 --> 01:33:00.328]  And it's the first book to ever expose, actually has over 1,000 pictures, photographs, illustrations.
[01:33:01.089 --> 01:33:09.695]  And it actually shows what I call the criminals of the Illuminati, some of the top politicians, entertainers, bankers, financiers,
[01:33:10.396 --> 01:33:11.316]  We're good to go.
[01:33:33.397 --> 01:33:34.438]  To put it all together.
[01:33:34.679 --> 01:33:36.601]  Codex Magica.
[01:33:36.681 --> 01:33:37.561]  Codex Magica.
[01:33:37.602 --> 01:33:39.704]  This is your creme de la creme.
[01:33:39.724 --> 01:33:42.046]  This is your masterwork.
[01:33:42.106 --> 01:33:49.814]  This thing just proves without a shadow of a doubt, folks, page after page, document after document,
[01:33:50.592 --> 01:33:55.013]  It's overwhelming, and I mean, I remember years ago, you were working on this book text.
[01:33:55.053 --> 01:34:01.115]  I mean, normally you'd write a book in a year, or even faster, and these were thick, well-researched, powerful books.
[01:34:01.155 --> 01:34:08.778]  I mean, the first book I ever heard the word RFID was your book, Project Lucid, back in 1996.
[01:34:09.218 --> 01:34:16.040]  I mean, no one had ever heard of it, and you have the documents, how it would be used to buy and sell, and how it would be used to track us, and
[01:34:17.015 --> 01:34:28.868]  Now Catherine Albrecht is getting kudos for writing it, and good for her, but Tex is a real trailblazer, and Tex, describe why you took so long to write this, and why it ended up being so long.
[01:34:29.268 --> 01:34:31.391]  I'm the same way, but not as scholarly as you are.
[01:34:31.771 --> 01:34:34.894]  You just want to keep adding more and more documentation because there's so much.
[01:34:35.215 --> 01:34:36.456]  Why leave any of it out?
[01:34:37.368 --> 01:34:41.490]  Well, you know, I had to leave some of it out, but still, it's in a large format.
[01:34:41.510 --> 01:34:44.431]  It's sort of like a coffee table type book.
[01:34:44.551 --> 01:34:45.832]  624 pages in all.
[01:34:45.852 --> 01:34:48.893]  It has a lot of footnotes and references, but mostly the pictures.
[01:34:49.453 --> 01:34:50.633]  And then I explain.
[01:34:51.054 --> 01:35:06.060]  And by the way, to make sure there's no argument, I go back and I actually have the pages out of some of the secret manuals and textbooks of the Illuminati secret societies and the Masonic handbooks and stuff.
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:06.580]  So I show...
[01:35:07.082 --> 01:35:16.247]  How they teach their initiates, for example, in Freemasonry, the first, the 33rd degrees, how they use their different hand signals and all and how they describe them.
[01:35:16.627 --> 01:35:17.808]  Then I actually show U.S.
[01:35:18.268 --> 01:35:30.215]  Senators, Presidents, Prime Ministers, Federal Reserve Chairman and so forth using these same symbols and how they do it, how they move their body, even the words they use.
[01:35:30.335 --> 01:35:31.676]  And listen to this, Alex.
[01:35:32.076 --> 01:35:35.298]  You're going to see this on the cover of Time, Newsweek,
[01:35:36.656 --> 01:35:45.998]  All of the CBS, ABC, NBC sitcoms, there's even entertainers that have been brought into this and taught how to use their bodies.
[01:35:47.618 --> 01:35:52.819]  Sitcoms like Seinfeld, you'll see Jewish capitalistic hand signs used.
[01:35:53.319 --> 01:36:02.320]  The sign of Satan, El Diablo, and I will explain the difference between that in the book and just what the deaf do, the I love you of the deaf.
[01:36:02.641 --> 01:36:05.221]  There is a significant difference and people will see that
[01:36:05.836 --> 01:36:11.197]  But all of those things are exposed, I believe, for the first time ever in this book.
[01:36:11.217 --> 01:36:12.178]  Why did it take so long?
[01:36:12.418 --> 01:36:17.859]  You know, I think what is interesting, and I didn't even think about it until this moment, here you and I are talking about Halloween.
[01:36:18.459 --> 01:36:22.861]  It is the second most significant day in the witchcraft calendar, Alex.
[01:36:23.561 --> 01:36:27.442]  I didn't realize my book is being released basically on Halloween Day.
[01:36:28.585 --> 01:36:33.428]  Maybe God wants us to expose the occult and to the Illuminati or the occult.
[01:36:33.528 --> 01:36:36.029]  It was going to be out about a month ago, but it got held up.
[01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:38.010]  Yeah, it got held up by the printer.
[01:36:39.031 --> 01:36:47.516]  And so now you're firing this major scholarly but also very interesting work at the enemy on their day.
[01:36:47.536 --> 01:36:51.438]  Of course, this is the eve of the day, and then tomorrow is when the book actually comes out.
[01:36:51.498 --> 01:36:54.780]  We put in our order now, folks, for a whole bunch of these.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:56.681]  So I hope you'll go to Infowars.com.
[01:36:58.197 --> 01:37:03.099]  Well, I want to mention again, because a lot of people know about InfoWars.com, your website.
[01:37:03.119 --> 01:37:04.339]  It'll be available there.
[01:37:04.359 --> 01:37:06.780]  Or they can go to our website, powerofprophecy.com,
[01:37:25.268 --> 01:37:28.809]  And, by the way, they can simply get our free newsletter.
[01:37:29.209 --> 01:37:33.551]  We'll be glad to give them this issue coming up, which talks about Codex Magica.
[01:37:33.591 --> 01:37:35.912]  And they'll see some of the actual hand signs.
[01:37:36.192 --> 01:37:37.492]  We won't even charge them for that.
[01:37:37.872 --> 01:37:41.533]  Just ask for the free newsletter about Codex Magica.
[01:37:41.553 --> 01:37:46.795]  Just call toll-free 1-800-234-9673 and say, I'd like to know more about Codex Magica.
[01:37:46.815 --> 01:37:48.356]  Nobody will ask you to...
[01:37:53.086 --> 01:37:54.826]  You know, to give a cent.
[01:37:54.846 --> 01:37:58.507]  We'll just take your name and address down and we'll send it right in the mail to you.
[01:37:58.887 --> 01:38:00.067]  No obligation whatsoever.
[01:38:00.167 --> 01:38:04.328]  And folks, it's a really nice newsletter with a lot of key information.
[01:38:04.668 --> 01:38:07.909]  In fact, when I did a newsletter for a while, I modeled it off of Texas.
[01:38:07.929 --> 01:38:08.969]  In fact, copied it, really.
[01:38:09.389 --> 01:38:12.149]  And then even used the same printer here in Austin because it's so nice.
[01:38:13.030 --> 01:38:15.230]  Tex, give that number out again twice, please.
[01:38:15.790 --> 01:38:16.550]  Well, you're very kind.
[01:38:16.570 --> 01:38:17.210]  1-800-TOLL-FREE-234-
[01:38:21.841 --> 01:38:22.382]  1-800-234-9673.
[01:38:22.482 --> 01:38:27.785]  Of course, they can go ahead and order the book.
[01:38:28.446 --> 01:38:29.987]  We're going to be getting it in this week.
[01:38:30.127 --> 01:38:31.748]  We'll mail it right out.
[01:38:31.828 --> 01:38:35.770]  But I want to mention, as soon as we get it off the truck, we're going to bring over your boxes, too.
[01:38:36.471 --> 01:38:37.951]  I believe people will wake up.
[01:38:38.152 --> 01:38:43.495]  This will awaken thousands of people because we're being conditioned.
[01:38:44.338 --> 01:38:45.659]  We're being propagandized.
[01:38:45.939 --> 01:39:02.046]  I mean, Codex Magic is going to wake up more than that, because I have really, and I told you earlier, I really wanted to make a documentary where I went through and showed it all, but there's so much to have it in this coffee table style book, such an easy read, so well illustrated, to have all of their own photos, their own admissions.
[01:39:02.406 --> 01:39:05.927]  This is how the elite communicates with each other.
[01:39:06.007 --> 01:39:10.609]  This is, I mean, really, these occult groups, folks, are like the original secret societies.
[01:39:10.989 --> 01:39:12.050]  They're really just...
[01:39:13.058 --> 01:39:17.859]  Intelligence agencies with these occult trappings and these occult beliefs involved.
[01:39:18.139 --> 01:39:24.840]  So now people are going to have really the blueprint to understand a whole new language.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:28.461]  It's like learning German or learning French or learning Spanish.
[01:39:28.521 --> 01:39:29.261]  Isn't it, Texton?
[01:39:29.301 --> 01:39:33.422]  You have kind of decoded the Rosetta Stone.
[01:39:34.522 --> 01:39:36.363]  Well, I believe that I have.
[01:39:36.883 --> 01:39:39.884]  And I've used, interestingly enough, their own textbooks.
[01:39:39.944 --> 01:39:41.044]  I've had to go all the way back to 1860
[01:39:43.105 --> 01:39:46.888]  Even the 1700s to find some of these textbooks.
[01:39:46.908 --> 01:39:56.554]  It's interesting how a lot of high-level Freemasons have died over the years, and their widows have sent me their libraries and their books.
[01:39:56.574 --> 01:40:06.920]  So this is how I came upon much of the material, literally from widows who were horrified when they went into their dead husbands' libraries and such and found the textbooks there.
[01:40:07.615 --> 01:40:08.456]  And such.
[01:40:08.957 --> 01:40:10.538]  And by the way, you mentioned Amun.
[01:40:11.740 --> 01:40:19.928]  One of the ladies, the widows, actually sent me a book and showed where her husband had been worshipping the god Amun, believing that he would gain prosperity.
[01:40:20.481 --> 01:40:26.846]  And you mentioned that the pagans and the witches were demonstrating against you and worshipping the god of Amun.
[01:40:27.127 --> 01:40:28.868]  You haven't seen the video yet.
[01:40:28.968 --> 01:40:34.533]  That's what the ritual is to give them prosperity and to take it away from George Bush.
[01:40:34.813 --> 01:40:41.499]  At the end of the ritual, they say, give us prosperity, and then they turn towards them and say, take it away from them.
[01:40:42.379 --> 01:40:43.240]  Take it away from them.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:45.082]  You know, it's interesting now.
[01:40:45.102 --> 01:40:48.805]  A lot of people say, well, hand signs, handshakes,
[01:40:49.401 --> 01:40:54.764]  Secret gestures, the way things are set up in the movies and in magazine scenes.
[01:40:55.504 --> 01:40:57.165]  This is just clown stuff.
[01:40:57.205 --> 01:40:59.166]  This is just fun and games.
[01:40:59.326 --> 01:41:09.591]  This is not serious, but remember, John Wayne Gacy, who killed 28 young boys, this homosexual monster, loved to dress up as a clown.
[01:41:10.711 --> 01:41:15.994]  And he once told a police officer, quote, a clown can get away with murder.
[01:41:17.085 --> 01:41:22.068]  So, you know, it's like they're mocking, they're tormenting the masses.
[01:41:22.369 --> 01:41:24.910]  They believe we're so stupid, so profane.
[01:41:24.990 --> 01:41:26.371]  Well, it's like Bohemian Grove.
[01:41:26.691 --> 01:41:29.053]  Either people watch the ritual and they go, oh, it's just a play.
[01:41:29.333 --> 01:41:30.394]  They're just having fun.
[01:41:30.574 --> 01:41:33.136]  Folks, world leaders travel from around the world.
[01:41:33.516 --> 01:41:42.222]  Helmut Schmidt in his own autobiography, German Chancellor, said, we do druid rituals in Germany, but my favorite place to do them is in America.
[01:41:42.502 --> 01:41:44.163]  They take it very seriously.
[01:41:45.925 --> 01:41:49.186]  He did say that in his biography, Men and Powers.
[01:41:49.506 --> 01:41:51.127]  I recall reading that, Alex.
[01:41:51.147 --> 01:41:52.127]  You've got a great memory.
[01:41:54.028 --> 01:41:55.408]  These people believe this.
[01:41:55.588 --> 01:42:05.292]  And by the way, when you study the history of the Illuminati, something like Halloween and what happens at Halloween is fun and games, but it's serious for them.
[01:42:05.952 --> 01:42:11.694]  You know, we look back and we see things like the guillotine during the French Revolution as hideous and gruesome.
[01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:14.531]  It's almost like a Halloween-ish thing.
[01:42:15.031 --> 01:42:16.872]  But these were live human beings.
[01:42:16.972 --> 01:42:20.254]  Thousands brought to the guillotine with their heads cut off.
[01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:22.014]  And why did it happen?
[01:42:22.155 --> 01:42:25.176]  Because of the Order of the Illuminati that was founded in 1776.
[01:42:26.897 --> 01:42:30.378]  By the way, its official founding date was May 1st.
[01:42:30.939 --> 01:42:36.341]  That's the Witches' Sabbat, their great high holy day, called Beltane.
[01:42:36.861 --> 01:42:38.022]  It's the worship of Baal.
[01:42:38.062 --> 01:42:40.423]  And there, again, we go back to the Bible.
[01:42:41.541 --> 01:42:44.863]  The great fire god, Baal, was worshipped by the ancients.
[01:42:45.644 --> 01:42:49.706]  So all of these things, they bring back the ancient mystery religions.
[01:42:50.847 --> 01:42:55.770]  And that's why I believe the witches go and howl at the moon.
[01:42:55.870 --> 01:43:02.474]  By the way, in a book called Under the Sign of the Scorpion, which we offer at PowerofProssey.com,
[01:43:03.362 --> 01:43:11.467]  Jerry Lena, who did tremendous research in this book, he's a man from Sweden, and I'm going to send you a copy of his book, Alex, if you don't have it.
[01:43:12.167 --> 01:43:18.711]  But he actually documents how Lennon, in his last days, his body was wrecked.
[01:43:18.771 --> 01:43:21.352]  He died of syphilis, believe it or not, Vladimir Lennon.
[01:43:22.193 --> 01:43:30.918]  But he would have his servants wheel him out to his balcony on the night of the full moon, and he would howl like a wolf.
[01:43:32.324 --> 01:43:41.091]  And here is the man who is still worshipped today by Marxists in America, many of the college professors, howling at the moon.
[01:43:41.671 --> 01:43:44.874]  And of course, the witches worship the great moon goddess.
[01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:48.501]  And Ozzy Osbourne, oh yeah, buck at the moon.
[01:43:49.102 --> 01:43:53.866]  And then George Bush calls him in and goes, ha, blood and hell and death and destruction, we love Ozzy.
[01:43:54.246 --> 01:43:55.287]  It's all a big joke.
[01:43:55.327 --> 01:43:57.949]  Oh, and Skull and Bones, mock sacrifice, it's all a joke.
[01:43:58.409 --> 01:44:01.491]  But then in the real world, they're bombing innocent countries.
[01:44:01.511 --> 01:44:03.333]  They're running over people with bulldozers.
[01:44:03.573 --> 01:44:05.955]  They're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[01:44:06.235 --> 01:44:07.836]  They're putting poison in the water.
[01:44:08.096 --> 01:44:10.618]  They're genetically engineering the food where it's toxic.
[01:44:10.878 --> 01:44:14.240]  They're doing all this evil, Tex, and we ask, why, why, why?
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:16.121]  It's a sacrifice, isn't it?
[01:44:17.302 --> 01:44:17.822]  It is.
[01:44:18.062 --> 01:44:18.823]  I am convinced.
[01:44:18.863 --> 01:44:21.485]  In fact, I did two hours of radio programs on this.
[01:44:21.505 --> 01:44:25.487]  I have the audio tapes now of what happened at the World Trade Center.
[01:44:26.048 --> 01:44:29.310]  It was absolutely a satanic sacrifice there.
[01:44:29.690 --> 01:44:31.071]  Those two buildings coming down.
[01:44:31.619 --> 01:44:39.624]  Everything is done by these people, Alex, during either the new moon or the full moon, and many times occult astrology.
[01:44:39.664 --> 01:44:47.488]  Now, that's not the astrology you read about in your newspaper when you want to know what, you know, for fun and games, the horoscope, the sun signs.
[01:44:47.888 --> 01:44:59.635]  There is a deep form of occult astrology, and they use this, and they use the witch's eight sabbats each year, you know, all the way, they have a witch's calendar, and
[01:45:00.217 --> 01:45:09.220]  And they frame all of their works around these days because they believe that this brings in, unleashes the powers from the spirit world.
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:10.840]  So they do.
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:18.262]  By the way, Robert Mueller, former Assistant Secretary General of the United Nations, all of its 32 directorates reported to him.
[01:45:19.022 --> 01:45:23.944]  Now, there is a Secretary General, but this guy actually runs the UN on a day-to-day basis.
[01:45:24.284 --> 01:45:25.504]  He recently retired.
[01:45:25.584 --> 01:45:26.724]  He's like the city manager.
[01:45:27.265 --> 01:45:28.645]  Exactly, like a city manager.
[01:45:29.235 --> 01:45:34.680]  He admits, in his book, I have a copy of a book by him called First Lady of the World.
[01:45:35.340 --> 01:45:38.523]  He says you've got to take a Luciferian initiation or you'll be killed.
[01:45:39.804 --> 01:45:40.324]  That's right.
[01:45:40.404 --> 01:45:43.647]  And he actually... Remember, First Lady of the World.
[01:45:44.628 --> 01:45:47.150]  The witches call their goddess the First Lady.
[01:45:47.890 --> 01:45:48.030]  Ah!
[01:45:48.371 --> 01:45:49.592]  Sort of interesting.
[01:45:50.192 --> 01:45:51.653]  Our Lady, the First Lady.
[01:45:52.294 --> 01:45:53.495]  But Mueller says...
[01:45:54.338 --> 01:46:01.344]  That the Rockefellers donated the money to buy the land on which the United Nations building sits.
[01:46:02.505 --> 01:46:05.728]  Okay, so we have the Rockefeller connection of the Illuminati.
[01:46:06.068 --> 01:46:15.977]  But then he says the reason that site was chosen there was because in decades past it had been used as a cattle slaughtering place.
[01:46:16.883 --> 01:46:21.448]  And he said thousands and thousands of cattle were brought there and slaughtered.
[01:46:21.469 --> 01:46:27.456]  He said the blood of these cows ran into the ground and made that a holy and sacred place.
[01:46:28.477 --> 01:46:31.100]  The sacrifice of the cows, their blood...
[01:46:31.573 --> 01:46:33.974]  Makes the United Nations a holy place.
[01:46:34.314 --> 01:46:36.755]  Well, Tex, this is what you do as a scholar.
[01:46:37.135 --> 01:46:40.076]  You go get books that these world leaders wrote themselves.
[01:46:40.436 --> 01:46:46.818]  You put it in a big book, show pictures of them making hand signs, and have all this evidence, and still people are in denial.
[01:46:46.878 --> 01:46:52.300]  It's not like he didn't say this, and Schmidt didn't say this, and it isn't like...
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:57.021]  Ronald Reagan, to the exact minute he gave a speech, was according to deep astrology.
[01:46:57.502 --> 01:47:00.723]  It's not like the Bushes and Kerry aren't skull and bones, aren't Bohemian Grove.
[01:47:01.143 --> 01:47:04.684]  I mean, their whole worlds revolve around this.
[01:47:05.964 --> 01:47:06.664]  They do indeed.
[01:47:06.684 --> 01:47:09.505]  You know, you mentioned the order of skull and bones.
[01:47:09.565 --> 01:47:11.946]  Here again, do we not have a Halloween celebration?
[01:47:12.626 --> 01:47:14.067]  They dress up in costumes.
[01:47:14.107 --> 01:47:15.567]  They have bones.
[01:47:16.187 --> 01:47:17.168]  Literally bones.
[01:47:18.068 --> 01:47:19.328]  I mean, of human beings.
[01:47:20.809 --> 01:47:21.529]  And their tomb...
[01:47:22.136 --> 01:47:23.136]  Which is the name of their building.
[01:47:23.156 --> 01:47:24.437]  You know, you've discussed this.
[01:47:24.477 --> 01:47:26.958]  We've talked about it together even on the radio.
[01:47:27.438 --> 01:47:30.339]  And on your website, there's articles about it.
[01:47:30.819 --> 01:47:35.121]  So this was a Halloween celebration, but they take it deadly serious.
[01:47:35.721 --> 01:47:38.102]  And I believe it carries on into their life.
[01:47:39.082 --> 01:47:42.464]  And the American people, it is so fantastic.
[01:47:42.484 --> 01:47:45.305]  You know, many people are so good.
[01:47:45.425 --> 01:47:46.485]  And they're gullible.
[01:47:46.525 --> 01:47:47.426]  They're sincere.
[01:47:48.146 --> 01:47:49.406]  They can't believe this.
[01:47:49.446 --> 01:47:50.867]  They can't believe it's possible.
[01:47:51.741 --> 01:48:00.744]  That a Bill Clinton or a George W. Bush, and notice we've got Democrats and Republicans there, or a Hillary Clinton or a Laura Bush could be involved in this.
[01:48:01.184 --> 01:48:03.065]  Well, it's also very, very scary.
[01:48:04.205 --> 01:48:11.787]  Well, it is, because it totally destroys our concept of politics and government.
[01:48:13.908 --> 01:48:16.249]  I'll give you one example of this, Alex.
[01:48:16.589 --> 01:48:19.650]  I mentioned that Halloween was not celebrated in America until 1845.
[01:48:22.153 --> 01:48:25.134]  Here's something for your audience to get some meat onto.
[01:48:25.614 --> 01:48:36.998]  It was in 1845, I have it right here, the United States Congress passed the law which set the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November as Election Day.
[01:48:37.959 --> 01:48:40.059]  Now we have Election Day coming up this week, right?
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:40.720]  Yes.
[01:48:41.100 --> 01:48:43.040]  The first Tuesday after the first Monday.
[01:48:43.181 --> 01:48:44.161]  Why did they do that?
[01:48:44.781 --> 01:48:49.763]  Because this was a special day to the Druids and the witches
[01:48:52.350 --> 01:48:54.651]  Of which the Illuminati are patterned after their date.
[01:48:55.112 --> 01:48:56.632]  This was known as Slaughter Day.
[01:48:56.792 --> 01:48:58.994]  It was the day they slaughtered their cattle.
[01:48:59.674 --> 01:49:02.496]  Now they couldn't do it on a Monday because that was the Moon Day.
[01:49:02.556 --> 01:49:03.856]  That was the worship of the goddess.
[01:49:04.277 --> 01:49:05.717]  They had to do it on Tuesday.
[01:49:05.777 --> 01:49:09.059]  It was the first Tuesday then, you might say, after the first Monday.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:10.480]  After what?
[01:49:11.161 --> 01:49:13.322]  After Halloween, or So Wayne Day.
[01:49:13.962 --> 01:49:15.443]  The day they worshipped the dead.
[01:49:16.879 --> 01:49:26.262]  They kill their cows, slaughter their animals for the coming winter season so they can store the food, and the blood flowed on that day.
[01:49:26.502 --> 01:49:28.042]  Election day is slaughter day.
[01:49:29.343 --> 01:49:30.183]  It's unbelievable.
[01:49:30.223 --> 01:49:30.963]  Tex, stay there.
[01:49:30.983 --> 01:49:37.445]  We're going to come back and get a little bit into how they're replacing other Christian holidays with other pagan dates.
[01:49:38.311 --> 01:49:39.012]  White Christmas.
[01:49:39.252 --> 01:49:45.199]  And again, one more time, you've got to get the new book, Codex Magica, available at InfoWars.com right now.
[01:49:45.539 --> 01:49:46.300]  Taking pre-orders.
[01:49:46.380 --> 01:49:47.201]  It's coming in this week.
[01:49:47.221 --> 01:49:48.042]  We'll ship it out to you.
[01:49:48.382 --> 01:49:51.726]  Or get it over there from Tex Mars, directly from the source, Power of Prophecy.
[01:49:54.181 --> 01:49:57.123]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:57.783 --> 01:49:59.084]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:49:59.284 --> 01:50:05.028]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:50:05.288 --> 01:50:10.511]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:50:10.831 --> 01:50:15.014]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:50:15.154 --> 01:50:18.937]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world where the military and the police are merged.
[01:50:19.197 --> 01:50:23.841]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards and, yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:23.941 --> 01:50:30.185]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.226 --> 01:50:32.067]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:52.357]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:50:54.005 --> 01:50:57.009]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:50:57.349 --> 01:51:06.199]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:51:06.499 --> 01:51:11.185]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:11.645 --> 01:51:18.368]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:51:18.748 --> 01:51:30.534]  It also removes foul-tasted odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:31.014 --> 01:51:35.479]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:52:25.458 --> 01:52:25.979]  We're good to go.
[01:52:25.999 --> 01:52:26.299]  I think?
[01:53:02.444 --> 01:53:10.506]  Codex Magica, 620-something pages long, over a thousand pictures, secret signs, mysterious symbols, and the hidden codes of the Illuminati.
[01:53:11.186 --> 01:53:15.427]  And you know, so much stuff about the occult that I've researched, it's baloney.
[01:53:16.047 --> 01:53:19.327]  And so many of these books about codes and the Bible and all this, more baloney.
[01:53:19.907 --> 01:53:20.667]  This is real.
[01:53:20.727 --> 01:53:28.769]  This is the dominant force in our world, our occultists, who think that we're a bunch of cattle, and they openly write about it in their memoirs,
[01:53:29.588 --> 01:53:33.509]  And countless widows get into their attics and find all this stuff later.
[01:53:33.549 --> 01:53:34.370]  We end up getting it.
[01:53:34.850 --> 01:53:38.111]  But Charlotte Iserby, you know, she was high-level Reagan administration.
[01:53:38.391 --> 01:53:43.733]  Her dad was skull and bones Bohemian Grove and had like a deathbed confession and accepted Jesus before he died.
[01:53:43.753 --> 01:53:45.234]  She was taking care of him when he had cancer.
[01:53:46.094 --> 01:53:51.536]  He had to listen to her every day doing talk radio interviews about what was happening with education.
[01:53:51.556 --> 01:53:56.398]  And he finally woke up and he said, oh yeah, he cried about being a member and said it was horrible.
[01:53:56.418 --> 01:53:57.078]  That's all he'd say.
[01:53:58.348 --> 01:54:05.811]  But the point is that it's not too late for people to turn back, but most of them have already totally gone over to the other side, so I guess it may be too late.
[01:54:05.831 --> 01:54:07.231]  That's open for debate.
[01:54:07.912 --> 01:54:09.452]  But this is what's running things.
[01:54:09.492 --> 01:54:10.553]  You want to know the language?
[01:54:10.633 --> 01:54:11.973]  Believe me, I've studied it a lot.
[01:54:12.373 --> 01:54:25.318]  To be able to see it on the cornerstones of buildings, know what sect it is, know what their specialties are, know what they're doing when they're flashing hand signs on TV, when I'm debating somebody on TV and they're flashing hand signs, all this stuff.
[01:54:26.309 --> 01:54:34.975]  I told the story of my great-great-uncle, Uncle Houston, my dad's great-uncle, and he was a Mason, and he ran, during Prohibition, ran liquor stores.
[01:54:36.115 --> 01:54:37.336]  Underground, you know, speakeasies.
[01:54:37.756 --> 01:54:39.457]  And Houston and two guys tried to rob him.
[01:54:39.477 --> 01:54:39.998]  He killed them.
[01:54:40.938 --> 01:54:47.763]  And the point is, is that he went in and flashed a Mason in distress sign at the judge, and the judge just in case dismissed instantly.
[01:54:48.903 --> 01:54:50.484]  And, you know, that can be abused.
[01:54:50.544 --> 01:54:51.345]  That is abuse.
[01:54:51.385 --> 01:54:53.006]  My Uncle Houston wasn't evil, folks.
[01:54:53.046 --> 01:54:54.587]  He was a mid-level Mason.
[01:54:55.484 --> 01:54:59.626]  But later in life, became eye-level, and he told my daddy, don't join the Masons.
[01:55:01.848 --> 01:55:02.148]  Why?
[01:55:02.168 --> 01:55:03.348]  He wouldn't exactly tell him.
[01:55:04.369 --> 01:55:05.750]  But now we know.
[01:55:06.810 --> 01:55:09.752]  And look, it's so important to get Codex Magica.
[01:55:09.792 --> 01:55:12.994]  Please go to Infowars.com or call toll-free to get it.
[01:55:13.877 --> 01:55:14.137]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:15.018 --> 01:55:21.364]  Get this new book.
[01:55:21.384 --> 01:55:21.764]  888-253-3139.
[01:55:22.345 --> 01:55:29.691]  Or go over to conspiracyworld.com and link through to get the phone number or text right there on that site as well.
[01:55:30.532 --> 01:55:32.734]  Text, we're about to break and come back and start the next hour.
[01:55:32.774 --> 01:55:35.977]  We will go to John and Mike and Larry and Gary and others.
[01:55:38.021 --> 01:55:57.268]  For the person that has trouble understanding why this occult system is out there and who buys into the propaganda that Christians are a bunch of nuts who just want to persecute these sweet little pagans, I don't think a lot of people realize that the pagans have also posed as Christians to carry out their sacrifices.
[01:55:57.508 --> 01:55:57.929]  Haven't they?
[01:55:58.909 --> 01:56:01.190]  Well, of course, they would have to do that.
[01:56:02.070 --> 01:56:06.512]  Satan would love nothing better than to pollute the real Christian church.
[01:56:07.116 --> 01:56:10.358]  But I think more and more today we're becoming aware of these things.
[01:56:10.418 --> 01:56:11.338]  We're becoming alert.
[01:56:12.379 --> 01:56:19.742]  And I myself, when I was a young man growing up, I couldn't imagine anything being wrong with Halloween.
[01:56:19.762 --> 01:56:21.884]  It was a little frightening, a little bit scary.
[01:56:22.564 --> 01:56:27.026]  But I didn't know it was actually an occult day still in practice.
[01:56:28.067 --> 01:56:31.228]  I recently read, and I know you have, the news headlines.
[01:56:31.248 --> 01:56:34.490]  This has been going on for several years in Europe and Belgium.
[01:56:35.737 --> 01:56:48.783]  Now we find out that there's an entire network of politicians and judges throughout Europe that are tied with a child abduction murder snuff film production ring.
[01:56:49.643 --> 01:56:51.064]  We're talking about killing toddlers.
[01:56:51.104 --> 01:56:53.044]  We're talking about killing toddlers.
[01:56:53.585 --> 01:56:58.407]  Killing toddlers and this guy had been let go by judges and such.
[01:56:58.867 --> 01:56:59.807]  These things are real.
[01:56:59.887 --> 01:57:01.248]  I believe it's happening in America.
[01:57:01.975 --> 01:57:03.156]  You know, just the mainstream.
[01:57:03.176 --> 01:57:11.981]  You know, Fred Barnes, who puts the Saturday Review or the National Review, one of the conservative magazines, said something on TV recently.
[01:57:12.041 --> 01:57:17.224]  He said, in all the history of the United States, a Freemason has never been convicted of murder.
[01:57:17.984 --> 01:57:21.566]  You mentioned that, how they favor each other, the judges and so forth.
[01:57:21.626 --> 01:57:22.567]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:57:22.987 --> 01:57:26.108]  Millions of Masons, not one of them has ever gone to the dead chair.
[01:57:26.349 --> 01:57:30.431]  Well, it is admitted that they let him go, then they found two more dead kids.
[01:57:33.562 --> 01:57:37.826]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[01:57:37.866 --> 01:57:38.287]  Big Brother.
[01:57:38.427 --> 01:57:39.047]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:39.208 --> 01:57:42.611]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:44.893 --> 01:57:47.556]  You want answers?
[01:57:47.856 --> 01:57:49.057]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.598 --> 01:58:01.559]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.780 --> 01:58:05.881]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.862 --> 01:58:10.983]  I tell you, two hours of this blasted bastard.
[01:58:12.125 --> 01:58:15.927]  We're going to be going to John and Larry and Gary and Alex here in just a few minutes.
[01:58:15.947 --> 01:58:20.990]  We're talking to Professor Tex Mars, a good friend of mine, pastor, best-selling author right here in Austin, Texas.
[01:58:21.010 --> 01:58:23.471]  The power of prophecy is his ministry.
[01:58:23.772 --> 01:58:28.935]  We'll tell you about his website and his toll-free number to get his amazing free newsletter before he leaves us.
[01:58:29.335 --> 01:58:30.595]  He's here talking about his new book.
[01:58:30.615 --> 01:58:32.256]  It comes out tomorrow.
[01:58:32.276 --> 01:58:33.457]  We're carrying it right now.
[01:58:33.477 --> 01:58:37.079]  I'm pre-ordering it, but it's coming in tomorrow or the next day.
[01:58:37.119 --> 01:58:37.900]  We'll be shipping it out.
[01:58:38.540 --> 01:58:40.261]  And that's Codex Magica.
[01:58:41.275 --> 01:58:42.976]  An amazing new encyclopedic book.
[01:58:43.417 --> 01:58:49.762]  When we come back from this quick segment, in the next segment, I want to ask you about Hugo Chavez saying we don't practice Halloween.
[01:58:49.782 --> 01:58:52.004]  We're not satanic like the Americans.
[01:58:53.305 --> 01:58:56.207]  Because I know a lot of Latin Americans, and they are scared to death of Halloween.
[01:58:56.587 --> 01:58:57.608]  Mexico's different, though.
[01:58:57.628 --> 01:59:00.591]  They're a little more satanic, more like the Western culture.
[01:59:01.171 --> 01:59:04.454]  Let's go ahead and go to John in Mass.
[01:59:04.874 --> 01:59:06.315]  John, you're on the air with Tex Mars.
[01:59:07.216 --> 01:59:07.756]  Hi, Alex.
[01:59:07.856 --> 01:59:08.297]  Hi, Tex.
[01:59:08.317 --> 01:59:09.658]  It's great to be on with you guys today.
[01:59:11.385 --> 01:59:18.491]  I just wanted to call because, number one, I'm calling from... I live in Salem, Massachusetts, which today I absolutely hate.
[01:59:18.771 --> 01:59:19.552]  Worst day of the year.
[01:59:19.772 --> 01:59:20.232]  Live here.
[01:59:21.553 --> 01:59:33.183]  But what a lot of people don't understand is, you know, a lot of people come up here, they're dressed in costumes, they go downtown, they hang out, but they don't understand that there's witches all over here that are practicing secret rituals.
[01:59:33.963 --> 01:59:36.886]  And it's one of those invite-only things, and...
[01:59:38.077 --> 01:59:39.679]  I mean, it really is incredible.
[01:59:39.759 --> 01:59:42.441]  It's going on right under everyone's nose, and they don't even get it.
[01:59:44.363 --> 01:59:46.845]  Well, and then we've studied it throughout history.
[01:59:46.885 --> 01:59:51.729]  You'll have the actual Satanists engaging in rituals and imposing as Christians.
[01:59:52.549 --> 01:59:53.810]  Tex, do you want to comment on this?
[01:59:54.571 --> 02:00:00.016]  Well, I think it is interesting up in Salem, Massachusetts, where I remember seeing pictures.
[02:00:00.036 --> 02:00:01.337]  I've never been to Massachusetts.
[02:00:01.397 --> 02:00:03.058]  I'm sure it's beautiful up in New England.
[02:00:03.659 --> 02:00:06.341]  But they actually have road signs.
[02:00:07.374 --> 02:00:13.519]  You know, inviting you into the land of the witches, and they have a picture of a witch riding a broom, supposedly.
[02:00:14.720 --> 02:00:36.338]  And I remember Governor Michael Dukakis, and I know John will remember this, he once had a little celebration, you might say, a little luncheon in his governor's mansion there, and he named one of the witches, I think it was Laurie Cabot or one of them, as the Commonwealth of Massachusetts official witch.
[02:00:37.242 --> 02:00:41.765]  And again, this is all supposed to be in great fun, but it's not so much fun.
[02:00:41.805 --> 02:00:48.609]  You know, I was recently reading a book published in France, but now in English because it was so popular.
[02:00:49.590 --> 02:00:54.233]  It is entitled, Abortion as a Religious Sacrament.
[02:00:55.674 --> 02:01:02.658]  And the author of it says that abortion is a wonderful thing and witches and goddess advocates should support it
[02:01:03.436 --> 02:01:07.379]  Because it is really the sacrifice of a live human being.
[02:01:07.419 --> 02:01:13.603]  Well, did you hear about coming in from Columbia, all of those dead babies inside the statues?
[02:01:13.623 --> 02:01:18.827]  And it was hardly even in our news, but it was in the BBC, being shipped in for rituals in Miami a month ago.
[02:01:19.327 --> 02:01:20.788]  Oh my goodness, though, I missed that.
[02:01:21.569 --> 02:01:23.290]  That is just incredible.
[02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:29.334]  And barely, it was in the BBC, showed photos of all these statues with dead babies on them, and they were going to gobble them.
[02:01:30.094 --> 02:01:35.735]  Wow, this is just... Well, it is grotesque, and it is real, and that's what I want to encourage people to understand.
[02:01:35.755 --> 02:01:37.696]  Well, how dare you say they're bad, eaten, dead babies, Dex?
[02:01:37.736 --> 02:01:40.937]  That's a friendly thing to do.
[02:01:40.977 --> 02:01:58.921]  Well, you know, again, we get back to the ancient mystery religions, and one of the things I show in Codex Magica, whether it's Albert Pike, the former Sovereign Grand Commander of Freemasonry, all of the Satan worshippers and the leaders of the early Illuminati, all of them
[02:01:59.819 --> 02:02:02.641]  believed, basically, in sacrifice.
[02:02:04.543 --> 02:02:21.735]  It's interesting that Pike, who actually used Indians during the Civil War to take the scalp of Yankee soldiers, he was a Civil War Confederate general, and it's interesting that his statue sits in front, or stands in front, of the U.S.
[02:02:21.775 --> 02:02:24.196]  Justice Department in Washington, D.C.,
[02:02:25.746 --> 02:02:28.608]  Yeah, right down the street from the Supreme Court.
[02:02:28.989 --> 02:02:29.789]  Isn't that amazing?
[02:02:29.829 --> 02:02:34.273]  A Confederate War General statue stands in Washington, D.C.
[02:02:34.313 --> 02:02:36.315]  on public land in front of the Justice Department.
[02:02:36.775 --> 02:02:38.336]  Jesse Jackson doesn't seem to care.
[02:02:38.717 --> 02:02:43.040]  Well, Jesse's a 33rd degree Mason, as is Colin Powell.
[02:02:43.100 --> 02:02:43.681]  We've got a break.
[02:02:43.801 --> 02:02:45.102]  We'll be right back with more calls.
[02:02:46.388 --> 02:02:49.250]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.491 --> 02:02:50.191]  Hello, my friends.
[02:02:50.291 --> 02:02:51.092]  Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.412 --> 02:02:56.116]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.436 --> 02:03:03.162]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[02:03:03.482 --> 02:03:05.484]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:03:05.684 --> 02:03:08.526]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.606 --> 02:03:13.270]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:17.893]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.134 --> 02:03:25.359]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:28.021]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:03:28.182 --> 02:03:29.923]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.
[02:03:30.303 --> 02:03:36.070]  1-888-253-3139 Or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[02:03:36.150 --> 02:03:43.058]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 Or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:03:46.380 --> 02:03:55.446]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and MTBE to below detectable limits.
[02:03:55.706 --> 02:04:06.933]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[02:04:07.273 --> 02:04:12.977]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no problem.
[02:04:13.217 --> 02:04:14.158]  We're good to go.
[02:04:37.475 --> 02:04:37.576]  803-4438.
[02:04:37.656 --> 02:04:40.104]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:04:47.441 --> 02:04:48.882]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[02:04:49.102 --> 02:04:53.024]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[02:04:53.304 --> 02:05:00.627]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste spill is something we all face every day.
[02:05:00.907 --> 02:05:02.808]  That's why no family should be without the NucAlert.
[02:05:03.128 --> 02:05:09.891]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the NucAlert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[02:05:10.231 --> 02:05:13.153]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[02:05:13.393 --> 02:05:16.034]  Your NucAlert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area,
[02:05:16.294 --> 02:05:16.474]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:16.494 --> 02:05:17.715]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your nuclear today.
[02:05:17.795 --> 02:05:20.016]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[02:05:20.116 --> 02:05:24.038]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[02:05:24.058 --> 02:05:24.278]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:05:24.298 --> 02:05:25.999]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your nuclear today.
[02:05:26.019 --> 02:05:26.500]  Nuclear.
[02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:27.480]  Isn't your family worth it?
[02:05:45.341 --> 02:05:47.562]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.122 --> 02:05:50.982]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:56.863 --> 02:06:00.544]  Chavez, president of Venezuela, calls for ban on Halloween.
[02:06:00.584 --> 02:06:00.984]  BBC.
[02:06:01.044 --> 02:06:04.705]  He said, we don't dress our children up like witches.
[02:06:05.865 --> 02:06:06.725]  We're not like that.
[02:06:06.785 --> 02:06:08.306]  We're not here to terrorize our people.
[02:06:08.326 --> 02:06:09.286]  We're not Satanists.
[02:06:10.426 --> 02:06:14.427]  We're not here to put fear into our nation, putting fear into their own people.
[02:06:15.974 --> 02:06:21.218]  And there have been lanterns being put around the Capitol building with little threats in it as of late.
[02:06:22.258 --> 02:06:23.779]  Little threats to Chavez.
[02:06:23.819 --> 02:06:28.783]  Now, I'm not here defending Chavez and his political views, but the point is that he's outside the New World Order.
[02:06:28.803 --> 02:06:30.184]  He's not playing ball with them.
[02:06:30.664 --> 02:06:31.885]  Clearly they hate his guts.
[02:06:32.445 --> 02:06:34.327]  Oh, a strange bedfellow here.
[02:06:35.107 --> 02:06:37.569]  Chavez agrees with us that it's really bad news.
[02:06:37.589 --> 02:06:42.272]  I'm not for banning it because it's free speech, folks, but we need to be honest.
[02:06:43.067 --> 02:06:48.250]  About this, and under the hate crime laws, I wouldn't be able to criticize this, and they're trying to get those passed.
[02:06:48.270 --> 02:06:49.071]  They have in England.
[02:06:49.571 --> 02:06:55.155]  I mean, how can they have the head of the Church of England, the Bishop of Canterbury, openly as a druid?
[02:06:55.195 --> 02:07:07.303]  I have the video of him, and photos of him in the new film, in his druid outfit with the big sword, and Julius Caesar, right there at that very spot 2,000 years ago, saw them eating the people they'd sacrificed.
[02:07:07.343 --> 02:07:08.143]  I mean, this is admitted.
[02:07:09.304 --> 02:07:12.266]  Tex, why do you think Chavez is out here saying this now?
[02:07:13.107 --> 02:07:15.128]  Well, of course, Chavez has been attacked.
[02:07:15.608 --> 02:07:19.349]  And even Pat Robertson, by the way, you're going to find that he is a high-level Freemason.
[02:07:19.809 --> 02:07:24.970]  And you'll see the actual hand signals that Pat Robertson uses in my book, Codex Magica.
[02:07:25.390 --> 02:07:29.331]  So Pat Robertson, the seminar club, is a tool of the elite.
[02:07:29.771 --> 02:07:31.271]  And they're all after Hugo Chavez.
[02:07:31.391 --> 02:07:32.732]  And you're absolutely right.
[02:07:32.812 --> 02:07:34.092]  He will not play ball.
[02:07:34.798 --> 02:07:36.459]  With the Illuminati elite.
[02:07:36.539 --> 02:07:37.379]  They hate the guy.
[02:07:37.719 --> 02:07:38.779]  He has a lot of oil.
[02:07:39.479 --> 02:07:41.520]  More than just about anybody in this hemisphere.
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:43.941]  And they're going to... Watch out.
[02:07:44.221 --> 02:07:47.362]  He will probably be a dead man before long.
[02:07:47.382 --> 02:07:49.242]  I hope he's got some good bodyguards.
[02:07:49.722 --> 02:07:54.104]  But now he's giving speeches about how he doesn't want his people worshipping the devil like us.
[02:07:54.824 --> 02:07:57.665]  Well, I think he knows what he's talking about there.
[02:07:58.485 --> 02:08:00.826]  We are the leading country on the occult.
[02:08:00.866 --> 02:08:01.646]  I mean, our movies...
[02:08:03.258 --> 02:08:12.721]  You just turn on the television and just look at the array of evil, occultic, satanic slasher movies.
[02:08:13.241 --> 02:08:26.265]  Our kids are being programmed this way, and no wonder we're having things like what happened at Abu Ghraib Prison, because these kids are being taught that there's nothing wrong with this hideous activity.
[02:08:26.886 --> 02:08:28.166]  Oh, it's going to get worse.
[02:08:29.426 --> 02:08:30.907]  Well, it probably will get worse.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:35.803]  But it is interesting that Hugo Chavez is throwing this up to us right in our face.
[02:08:36.743 --> 02:08:41.146]  You know, the Bible says, and I don't mean to preach a sermon here, but it's very simple.
[02:08:41.186 --> 02:08:43.327]  A simple rule of thumb.
[02:08:43.387 --> 02:08:45.788]  It says, overcome evil with good.
[02:08:46.929 --> 02:08:49.090]  That's what we're supposed to do as Christians.
[02:08:49.530 --> 02:08:58.756]  But what kind of example is it to send evil, to transmit evil, throughout the world with this holiday?
[02:08:58.796 --> 02:08:59.416]  And by the way,
[02:09:00.043 --> 02:09:10.626]  If we are, supposedly we were formed first as a Christian nation, and a lot of people say that's not true, but again, Halloween was not practiced among the people.
[02:09:10.666 --> 02:09:19.167]  It was brought over here by immigrants to the United States and really began to get in popular means about 1845.
[02:09:19.708 --> 02:09:23.068]  So George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, they didn't know anything about Halloween.
[02:09:23.368 --> 02:09:25.369]  It would have been a grotesque thing for them.
[02:09:26.665 --> 02:09:32.935]  Well, also be clear, even the Associated Press is on the history of Christmas, and I've had guests on the written books about that.
[02:09:33.856 --> 02:09:36.120]  Santa Claus, I think it was like in 1820 to 1830 or so, they banned Christmas.
[02:09:40.293 --> 02:09:41.054]  We're good to go.
[02:09:41.074 --> 02:09:41.854]  We're good to go.
[02:10:03.068 --> 02:10:06.290]  And Santa Claus runs around basically stealing and murdering.
[02:10:06.970 --> 02:10:09.531]  And so now that's Coca-Cola, by the way.
[02:10:09.951 --> 02:10:11.492]  Santa, they made him popular in the 20s.
[02:10:11.552 --> 02:10:13.233]  He didn't even get popular in the 20s.
[02:10:13.733 --> 02:10:17.114]  Just one company, Coca-Cola, he's a friendly guy with a big beard.
[02:10:17.455 --> 02:10:18.675]  See, now that's Christmas.
[02:10:18.695 --> 02:10:27.179]  So they're even Easter, Ishtar, the bunny rabbit, the eggs, you know, Playboy, sex, fertility folks, you know, the symbol Ishtar, the bunny.
[02:10:27.539 --> 02:10:29.200]  I mean, they're taking everything over.
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:30.020]  They are.
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:40.628]  Now the first step is basically to pollute Christianity, to bring us these things, and they look good, they have tinsel on them, they look wonderful, they're gaily wrapped, all of these holidays.
[02:10:41.268 --> 02:10:48.053]  But eventually they will come back and admit it, and they will say, did you know that Christmas is really a pagan, satanic day?
[02:10:48.433 --> 02:10:54.978]  Did you know that the very word Santa, S-A-N-T-A, that word is an anagram for Satan?
[02:10:55.378 --> 02:10:57.059]  Just a little scrambling of the letters.
[02:10:57.475 --> 02:11:03.419]  They will actually admit what they have done to us, and people will go, oh, well, that's okay.
[02:11:03.699 --> 02:11:04.900]  See, this is their plan.
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:09.883]  It is the way the satanic psychologists work.
[02:11:10.444 --> 02:11:14.647]  Well, all you do is switch the T with the N, you get Satan.
[02:11:15.347 --> 02:11:16.668]  Yeah, you get Satan.
[02:11:16.688 --> 02:11:25.334]  And I can show you in the new age of cultic literature, for example, published by the Lucis Trust, they call their god Samat, S-A-M-A-T.
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:29.643]  So here again, he's saying an anagram for Satan.
[02:11:30.284 --> 02:11:40.133]  The Masons, of course, worship a god they call Jabulon, and they call him the great architect of the universe.
[02:11:40.213 --> 02:11:52.544]  So all of these shadowy names, of course, are synonyms when you really look into it, because Jabulon means a combination of Yahweh or Jehovah, Baal, and Onn,
[02:11:53.174 --> 02:11:56.876]  Which is one of the names of the Egyptian god, Osiris.
[02:11:57.056 --> 02:11:58.837]  Tex, I want to jam a few final calls in here.
[02:11:58.857 --> 02:12:00.878]  I know you've got to go, and I'm going to move quick through these.
[02:12:01.298 --> 02:12:04.280]  But what is the New World Order's final master plan?
[02:12:04.740 --> 02:12:07.562]  If they had their way, what would things look like right now?
[02:12:08.522 --> 02:12:10.864]  Well, they're on their way to getting it.
[02:12:10.904 --> 02:12:15.906]  What they want is a utopia in which the elite philosophers, which they think is them.
[02:12:16.246 --> 02:12:22.650]  You can be as stupid as George Bush, but he believes he's a king philosopher, as would have it back in platonic...
[02:12:23.174 --> 02:12:24.615]  Plato-type literature.
[02:12:25.115 --> 02:12:37.819]  They want a utopia on Earth, which means the peasants, a feudalistic system, will be reinstituted, and the masses will be ruled over by this lordly elite.
[02:12:38.540 --> 02:12:40.380]  And so that is the New World Order.
[02:12:41.481 --> 02:12:48.003]  So they're going to use religion, economics, politics, all those areas to bring it to pass.
[02:12:48.043 --> 02:12:50.184]  And so they're working in every field.
[02:12:51.269 --> 02:12:53.590]  These custodians of what they call the plan.
[02:12:55.331 --> 02:12:56.111]  Absolutely.
[02:12:56.912 --> 02:13:00.513]  Give us the toll-free number to get the free newsletter and the new book, Codex Magica.
[02:13:00.893 --> 02:13:01.073]  Sure.
[02:13:01.093 --> 02:13:03.474]  Codex Magica, of course, on InfoWars.com.
[02:13:04.475 --> 02:13:08.156]  But people can call us and get a free newsletter, and we'll tell them a little bit about it.
[02:13:09.077 --> 02:13:10.517]  Codex Magica is the name of it.
[02:13:10.658 --> 02:13:12.298]  Ask for that particular newsletter.
[02:13:12.638 --> 02:13:13.619]  Call us toll-free, 1-800-234-1800.
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:16.860]  1-800-234-9673
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:35.820]  It is right now.
[02:13:35.860 --> 02:13:39.661]  We just posted it today, and so same price as Texas on the 4.
[02:13:39.801 --> 02:13:40.341]  I hope you get it.
[02:13:40.721 --> 02:13:43.002]  It's $35 because it's 600-plus pages.
[02:13:43.022 --> 02:13:46.943]  It weighs 2 pounds, and I hope you'll get it and support what Texas is doing.
[02:13:47.663 --> 02:13:49.263]  Let's jam calls in.
[02:13:49.283 --> 02:13:51.304]  I know you guys have been patient, and I want to get to you.
[02:13:51.984 --> 02:13:54.205]  I guess next up here is Larry.
[02:13:55.105 --> 02:13:57.405]  Larry, you're calling us from Arizona, I believe.
[02:13:57.445 --> 02:13:57.866]  Go ahead.
[02:13:57.886 --> 02:13:59.786]  That's right, Alex.
[02:14:00.935 --> 02:14:05.097]  I had to call in when I heard that Tex was on your show because I owe Tex a thanks.
[02:14:05.377 --> 02:14:20.442]  Several years ago I made a missionary journey over to the Philippines and at that time Tex was offering free materials for missionaries and his office was kind enough to send me four cases of books which I handed out in the Philippines and the people there were very grateful.
[02:14:20.462 --> 02:14:23.303]  Yeah, Tex is one of the most gracious people I know.
[02:14:23.343 --> 02:14:24.123]  Very nice person.
[02:14:24.924 --> 02:14:28.605]  You are way too kind to me but thank you very much Alex and Larry.
[02:14:30.109 --> 02:14:32.910]  I'd like to ask you a question, if I can.
[02:14:33.651 --> 02:14:41.535]  One of your tape series that I got several years ago, and by the way, you were the first person that turned me on to all of this New World Order stuff back in the 90s.
[02:14:42.175 --> 02:14:43.376]  I also want to thank you for that.
[02:14:43.416 --> 02:14:46.237]  But what I wanted to ask you about was one tape series that you had about
[02:14:47.303 --> 02:14:52.446]  People that were ducking out of the Vietnam War and going into seminaries, and they really didn't do it for the right reason.
[02:14:52.466 --> 02:14:53.866]  Yeah, communist infiltrating.
[02:14:53.886 --> 02:14:54.607]  Thanks for the call.
[02:14:55.007 --> 02:14:55.867]  I want to take a few more.
[02:14:56.407 --> 02:14:57.288]  Tex, comment on that?
[02:14:58.028 --> 02:15:15.516]  Well, there was a Church of Universal Life, a fake church that came up during the Vietnam War, and I think three million guys became ministers of this fake church with a by-mail ordination certificate, and they got out of the war.
[02:15:16.167 --> 02:15:19.629]  And many of these people went on to actually pastor churches.
[02:15:20.049 --> 02:15:26.813]  There were hundreds of thousands who went to divinity schools and seminaries just because they were draft dodgers.
[02:15:27.294 --> 02:15:29.795]  And now, hey, they're in their high 40s, 50s, 60s.
[02:15:31.954 --> 02:15:34.175]  And they're running the religious establishment.
[02:15:34.215 --> 02:15:35.215]  Larry is absolutely right.
[02:15:35.335 --> 02:15:35.835]  Exactly.
[02:15:35.855 --> 02:15:37.716]  So be very careful who your pastor is.
[02:15:38.036 --> 02:15:38.736]  Exactly.
[02:15:39.476 --> 02:15:41.897]  Let's talk to Gary in Ohio.
[02:15:41.937 --> 02:15:42.757]  Gary, go ahead.
[02:15:42.777 --> 02:15:43.398]  Hi, Alex.
[02:15:43.438 --> 02:15:44.498]  First time I called you.
[02:15:44.518 --> 02:15:46.539]  I want to thank you for fighting the New World Order.
[02:15:47.039 --> 02:15:49.179]  I learned about 9-11, basically, from you.
[02:15:49.219 --> 02:15:50.440]  I've been passing out your videos.
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:53.621]  And also the whole globalist control thing.
[02:15:53.941 --> 02:15:54.461]  Well, thank you.
[02:15:54.641 --> 02:16:01.123]  I was least interested in the Bohemian Grove and the occult aspect of it until I saw Bohemian Grove and found out they're serious.
[02:16:02.582 --> 02:16:05.024]  They do that, you know, serious black magic stuff.
[02:16:05.304 --> 02:16:13.130]  I want to say, for most people, I'm sorry, I come from more on the left, and for most people, Halloween is just, you know, make-believe, goofy stuff.
[02:16:13.711 --> 02:16:20.476]  But as far as the globalists, I think that, you know, we're doing a great job of exposing them, but right now they own the army.
[02:16:20.516 --> 02:16:21.416]  They own the media.
[02:16:21.436 --> 02:16:23.258]  They can cut you off in a minute.
[02:16:23.298 --> 02:16:25.439]  They own the banking system, dollars, voting.
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:28.341]  They put pig genes in our tomatoes and our food.
[02:16:28.642 --> 02:16:30.483]  You know what they did with the water in Bolivia, right?
[02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.070]  Yes.
[02:16:39.813 --> 02:16:43.094]  Don't we really have to think about taking these things back from them?
[02:16:43.474 --> 02:16:50.177]  Not like Stalin or anything, but like a decentralized, grassroots control of all that stuff.
[02:16:50.197 --> 02:16:53.698]  Okay, I appreciate your call, and I wish you'd call back some other day.
[02:16:53.718 --> 02:16:55.079]  We could talk ten minutes about this.
[02:16:55.479 --> 02:16:56.339]  We're out of time.
[02:16:57.060 --> 02:16:59.201]  But yeah, you've got to decentralize things.
[02:16:59.521 --> 02:17:00.941]  You've got to break up these monopolies.
[02:17:00.981 --> 02:17:01.982]  They're not free market.
[02:17:02.002 --> 02:17:03.082]  They're the opposite of that.
[02:17:03.382 --> 02:17:06.944]  And so they love socialism because that consolidates wealth for them.
[02:17:06.984 --> 02:17:07.564]  Tex, do you agree?
[02:17:08.684 --> 02:17:09.224]  Absolutely.
[02:17:09.565 --> 02:17:19.668]  The only thing I would add, Alex, is a lot of these organizations, I believe Sierra Club, environmental groups and such, they are actually controlled by the elite.
[02:17:20.208 --> 02:17:22.449]  They claim to be decentralized, but they're not.
[02:17:22.849 --> 02:17:24.290]  But we need to develop mechanisms.
[02:17:24.370 --> 02:17:26.811]  We need to develop a true decentralization.
[02:17:26.951 --> 02:17:27.371]  You're right.
[02:17:28.055 --> 02:17:30.218]  Tex, I really want to thank you for coming on with us, my friend.
[02:17:30.238 --> 02:17:31.560]  I look forward to talking to you in the near future.
[02:17:32.080 --> 02:17:35.104]  Alex, great to be on with you and your wonderful audience again, and God bless you.
[02:17:35.264 --> 02:17:35.805]  God bless you.
[02:17:36.186 --> 02:17:38.408]  We'll be right back to tell you about forced vaccination.
[02:17:38.468 --> 02:17:41.773]  Coming up, InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:17:41.813 --> 02:17:43.194]  We're carrying Codex Magica.
[02:17:43.234 --> 02:17:43.475]  Get it!
[02:17:45.572 --> 02:17:51.794]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[02:17:52.234 --> 02:18:00.016]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[02:18:00.357 --> 02:18:08.199]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[02:18:08.519 --> 02:18:09.239]  Thanks for having me.
[02:18:28.547 --> 02:18:29.088]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[02:18:44.825 --> 02:18:45.546]  Hello, folks.
[02:18:45.566 --> 02:18:52.410]  This is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger, your source for free solar electricity.
[02:18:52.650 --> 02:18:59.754]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[02:18:59.894 --> 02:19:11.421]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is not available.
[02:19:11.741 --> 02:19:12.542]  We're good to go.
[02:19:12.562 --> 02:19:13.122]  We're good to go.
[02:19:42.201 --> 02:19:47.764]  803-4438 Government is best which governs least.
[02:19:48.304 --> 02:19:49.625]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:19:50.045 --> 02:19:52.746]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:19:53.206 --> 02:19:55.847]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:19:56.288 --> 02:20:02.770]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.
[02:20:03.071 --> 02:20:10.474]  Exercise your freedom of speech by purchasing your choice of hundreds of different Liberty Stickers, from humorous to serious, at libertystickers.com.
[02:20:11.234 --> 02:20:12.015]  We're good to go.

[02:20:46.073 --> 02:20:49.375]  In the past few years, millions of Americans have made the switch to natural products.
[02:20:49.695 --> 02:20:54.997]  Herbs, minerals, vitamins, and essential oils are now being recognized as the safest and most effective products in the quest for good health.
[02:20:55.237 --> 02:20:57.118]  Introducing Vitamir Mouthwash and Toothpaste.
[02:20:57.458 --> 02:21:01.960]  Vitamir has created unique and natural patented formulas that set them apart from any other oral hygiene products.
[02:21:02.180 --> 02:21:08.603]  The folks at Vitamir have blended zinc, folic acid, myrrh, and clove oil into gentle but effective products that freshen your breath and fight gum disease.
[02:21:08.803 --> 02:21:14.986]  Good health starts in your mouth, and regular use of Vitamir Toothpaste and Mouthwash is a powerful frontline defense against gingivitis, bleeding gums,
[02:21:15.186 --> 02:21:19.168]  And folks with braces or dentures will love that clean, fresh, just-from-the-dentist-office feeling.
[02:21:19.368 --> 02:21:22.730]  And once you've tried Vitamir, you just may find that no other toothpaste or mouthwash will do.

[02:21:30.053 --> 02:21:32.755]  You'll be glad you did, and so will that special someone in your life.

[02:21:37.697 --> 02:21:41.219]  Try Vitamir, and you'll feel that squeaky clean sensation others just talk about.
[02:21:53.948 --> 02:21:58.910]  Well, we've got the president of the National Vaccine Information Center on with us.
[02:21:58.930 --> 02:21:59.890]  We'll talk to him in a moment.
[02:22:00.171 --> 02:22:01.011]  Barbara Lee Fisher.
[02:22:01.031 --> 02:22:08.314]  They passed the Model State Self-Emergency Powers Act for Homeland Security, page 76, because they couldn't get the states to do it three years ago.
[02:22:08.354 --> 02:22:11.155]  They tried to order medical workers and police to take it.
[02:22:11.335 --> 02:22:13.716]  They wholesale refused 99 plus percent.
[02:22:15.063 --> 02:22:25.926]  According to the Associated Press and LA Times, showing that even the enforcers aren't stupid, when top virologists and others came out and said that this thing will spread smallpox and is very toxic.
[02:22:26.806 --> 02:22:28.426]  Well, here's one London Telegraph.
[02:22:28.866 --> 02:22:30.447]  Now, I see articles like this every day.
[02:22:30.707 --> 02:22:32.447]  Here's just one today because we've got this guest on.
[02:22:32.907 --> 02:22:35.508]  Flu jab may be fatal to some pensioners.
[02:22:36.866 --> 02:22:37.507]  We're good to go.
[02:23:00.939 --> 02:23:11.685]  Massive studies, I mean, medical studies, double-blind studies, decades-long studies show that folks that take four or five or more flu shots who are older get Alzheimer's.
[02:23:11.705 --> 02:23:12.525]  Well, yeah, the mercury.
[02:23:12.545 --> 02:23:14.206]  What do you think it does to your brain, folks?
[02:23:15.187 --> 02:23:18.548]  Alzheimer's is the exact same thing as mercury poisoning in many cases.
[02:23:20.269 --> 02:23:21.290]  And it's been a scourge.
[02:23:21.810 --> 02:23:23.531]  Autism up several thousand percent.
[02:23:23.551 --> 02:23:25.452]  We've had medical doctors on to cover this.
[02:23:26.212 --> 02:23:27.573]  They haven't taken it out of the shots.
[02:23:27.593 --> 02:23:29.274]  They've actually increased it in most shots.
[02:23:29.904 --> 02:23:30.425]  We're good to go.
[02:23:52.877 --> 02:23:54.238]  This is really scary.
[02:23:54.258 --> 02:23:56.378]  And now they want to give them liability protection.
[02:23:56.398 --> 02:23:57.119]  Now here's the difference.
[02:23:57.699 --> 02:23:59.900]  I'm for liability protection of gun makers.
[02:24:01.160 --> 02:24:05.202]  Because if somebody goes and buys a Louisville Slugger and beats your brains out, it's not Louisville Slugger's fault.
[02:24:05.582 --> 02:24:08.703]  Or if somebody runs over you in a Ford pickup truck on purpose, it's not Ford's fault.
[02:24:08.723 --> 02:24:10.544]  It's the same thing with guns.
[02:24:11.364 --> 02:24:19.687]  But with these shots, they claim it's a medical thing, they claim it's a drug, they claim it's something that helps you, and it doesn't, and they knowingly do this, they need to be held accountable.
[02:24:20.339 --> 02:24:25.303]  We're going to break here in a few minutes, but she's going to be with us for the balance of the broadcast until about 50 after.
[02:24:25.324 --> 02:24:27.105]  We'll try to jam a few calls in.
[02:24:27.566 --> 02:24:29.647]  And she is Barbara Lee Fisher.
[02:24:30.088 --> 02:24:31.889]  Barbara, we've got this new nightmare.
[02:24:31.990 --> 02:24:33.111]  It's passed the Senate.
[02:24:33.171 --> 02:24:33.871]  It's in the House.
[02:24:34.612 --> 02:24:35.373]  Tell us all about it.
[02:24:36.233 --> 02:24:40.677]  Yeah, it's the latest in federal legislation since September 11, 2001.
[02:24:44.207 --> 02:25:02.394]  That is trying to totally absolve the vaccine makers from all liability for vaccine injuries and deaths and also protect anyone who's connected with giving these vaccines, any public health officials, any physicians who give the vaccines for what happens after they give them.
[02:25:03.004 --> 02:25:14.828]  And it all started with the Homeland Security Bill after 9-1-1 and the Model State Health Emergency Powers Act, which were going through the states, being passed through the states.
[02:25:15.528 --> 02:25:30.153]  And then we have Project BioShield 2004, and now we have this latest legislation that is trying to take away all liability for whenever the Secretary of Health and Human Services declares even an imminent
[02:25:30.578 --> 02:25:32.520]  And this is going to be forcible, by the way, boys and girls.
[02:25:46.318 --> 02:25:52.742]  Yeah, I think that people really don't understand what they did with the Homeland Security bill.
[02:25:53.162 --> 02:26:02.847]  It was the most incredible reorganization of the checks and balances that we have had historically in power in this country.
[02:26:02.967 --> 02:26:03.848]  It tilts now.
[02:26:04.208 --> 02:26:05.668]  It's total federalization.
[02:26:05.709 --> 02:26:08.370]  It's a giant cloaking device for public martial law.
[02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:11.332]  Ron Paul and many others are now saying that.
[02:26:11.432 --> 02:26:13.953]  And certainly, I mean, that's where they started to talk about
[02:26:14.548 --> 02:26:22.988]  Where they gave the power to the Secretary of HHS to declare even an imminent public health emergency and use, quote, substance or substances on the people.
[02:26:24.119 --> 02:26:24.740]  You know, whatever.
[02:26:24.780 --> 02:26:25.700]  That's very broad.
[02:26:26.781 --> 02:26:31.463]  And then, of course, Project BioShield 2004 went further.
[02:26:31.483 --> 02:26:39.267]  And, in fact, there have been a number of military personnel who have been forced to take the Amtrax vaccine, which is basically an experimental vaccine.
[02:26:39.287 --> 02:26:41.308]  It has never been licensed by the Food and Drug Administration.
[02:26:41.348 --> 02:26:43.129]  And that's illegal even with the military.
[02:26:44.149 --> 02:26:45.030]  But I guess not now.
[02:26:45.610 --> 02:27:00.343]  No, and there's been a court case in the federal district court here, and there was a judge that said to Donald Rumsfeld, you may not give these soldiers this experimental vaccine without informed consent because it's experimental, it's against the law.
[02:27:00.842 --> 02:27:11.988]  And what the Secretary of Defense did in conjunction with the Secretary of HHS is invoke Project BioShield and had an emergency use authorization issued that got around that federal court order.
[02:27:12.368 --> 02:27:16.771]  So you see, already we're seeing what's happened when we give too much power to the executive branch.
[02:27:17.951 --> 02:27:21.673]  And folks, I mean, they're doing this on purpose to the troops.
[02:27:21.773 --> 02:27:24.295]  Understand, this is bioweapons testing on our own people.
[02:27:25.695 --> 02:27:29.217]  Oh boy, triple the deformities and all sorts of health problems.
[02:27:29.597 --> 02:27:30.218]  Everything's...
[02:27:31.184 --> 02:27:33.466]  Well, roll up your sleeves and get ready.
[02:27:35.729 --> 02:27:36.630]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.130 --> 02:27:38.732]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.653 --> 02:27:42.336]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.292 --> 02:27:48.774]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[02:27:49.134 --> 02:27:54.158]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[02:27:54.298 --> 02:27:55.659]  But now, we don't have to.
[02:27:55.679 --> 02:28:04.086]  This sacra wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[02:28:04.446 --> 02:28:08.469]  Simply lie on your back with the Sacro Wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[02:28:08.730 --> 02:28:11.512]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[02:28:11.892 --> 02:28:15.435]  Use the Sacro Wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.
[02:28:15.856 --> 02:28:19.519]  Get your Sacro Wedgie today for only $29.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:28:19.759 --> 02:28:19.999]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:20.019 --> 02:28:22.441]  That's 877-817-9829 and ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment too.
[02:28:22.621 --> 02:28:24.623]  Yeah, getting old is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[02:28:32.049 --> 02:28:35.355]  Get your soccer wedgie today and specify whether it's for a man or a woman.
[02:28:35.655 --> 02:28:35.816]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:28:35.836 --> 02:28:36.016]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:28:36.036 --> 02:28:36.837]  And give yourself a wedgie.
[02:28:46.116 --> 02:28:51.079]  Now you can bring Berkey Purification Power anywhere with the Sport Berkey Filtration Bottle.
[02:28:51.379 --> 02:28:56.821]  Ideal for sporting games, camping, or boating, or Sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[02:28:56.861 --> 02:29:01.143]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods, or earthquakes.
[02:29:01.484 --> 02:29:04.505]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[02:29:04.825 --> 02:29:08.247]  So effective you can drink raw, untreated water from lakes, rivers, and streams.
[02:29:08.587 --> 02:29:17.931]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[02:29:18.191 --> 02:29:21.692]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[02:29:21.932 --> 02:29:29.035]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[02:29:46.801 --> 02:29:52.123]  The ideology powering the Democrats and Republicans is not liberalism or conservatism, but globalism.
[02:29:52.423 --> 02:29:57.705]  Globalists are concerned with what's good for big business in the American empire, instead of what's fair for the American people.
[02:29:58.125 --> 02:30:01.146]  The only antidote to the poison of globalism is nationalism.

[02:30:50.968 --> 02:30:52.888]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:30:53.349 --> 02:30:56.149]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:02.611 --> 02:31:11.233]  Coming up on November 4th right here in Texas, and they don't have the special fraud electronic voting machines in everywhere, but we still have a chance to defeat this.
[02:31:12.073 --> 02:31:14.653]  90 plus percent of Texans are against toll roads.
[02:31:15.293 --> 02:31:17.314]  You're going to see election fraud at work here when
[02:31:18.032 --> 02:31:18.432]  You watch.
[02:31:18.452 --> 02:31:19.213]  There's a good chance.
[02:31:19.453 --> 02:31:22.915]  Oh, magically, though, it doesn't matter what old polls show, you voted for the tolls.
[02:31:24.335 --> 02:31:25.776]  We've caught them red-handed many times.
[02:31:25.816 --> 02:31:29.518]  That's why in your town, you don't have these new machines, and you really got to vote.
[02:31:30.158 --> 02:31:32.459]  Vote no on Prop 1 and Prop 9.
[02:31:32.639 --> 02:31:36.982]  One's the toll roads, and nine is trying to, so they can stay in office longer.
[02:31:37.702 --> 02:31:40.643]  Just vote no on 1 and 9 for our Texas audience.
[02:31:40.703 --> 02:31:43.765]  And no matter where you live in the country, they're coming at you with the toll roads.
[02:31:45.114 --> 02:31:48.997]  By the way, before school always opens, they tell you it's the law.
[02:31:49.037 --> 02:31:51.238]  You've got to go be vaccinated to go to school.
[02:31:51.278 --> 02:31:52.079]  There's no law.
[02:31:52.119 --> 02:31:52.959]  There's never been a law.
[02:31:53.579 --> 02:31:57.322]  But they're just lying, and it's a big, big business.
[02:31:58.242 --> 02:32:02.585]  Just with this flu scare they're doing with the bird flu.
[02:32:03.766 --> 02:32:05.127]  Look at what they've been able to do.
[02:32:06.448 --> 02:32:12.572]  They've been running around yelling and screaming about that and hyperventilating, and it turns out Rumsfeld's company is going to make between $4 and $7 million with this pill.
[02:32:15.433 --> 02:32:22.977]  And then one of the other companies has got connections under the White House making the flu vaccine, which they admit doesn't even cover this supposed flu.
[02:32:23.538 --> 02:32:30.562]  So it's just a huge payoff in the tens of billions of dollars each year to these guys, and then we find out what's in these vaccines.
[02:32:31.642 --> 02:32:36.585]  We have the CDC documents from 2000 where they said we've brain damaged millions, but we've got to cover this up.
[02:32:37.605 --> 02:32:38.966]  And it's by design, folks.
[02:32:39.687 --> 02:32:41.328]  So make no mistake, this is happening.
[02:32:41.348 --> 02:32:41.968]  This is coming.
[02:32:42.794 --> 02:32:43.355]  We're good to go.
[02:33:11.828 --> 02:33:15.131]  Continuing with what we're facing, how do we beat this?
[02:33:15.171 --> 02:33:17.612]  Because they just keep coming back with this.
[02:33:17.653 --> 02:33:18.773]  How do we beat this, Barbara?
[02:33:19.013 --> 02:33:25.298]  Well, you know, I don't know how we're going to really be able to stop this bill.
[02:33:26.119 --> 02:33:27.259]  We might be able to.
[02:33:27.480 --> 02:33:33.104]  People are going to have to contact their congresspersons, and they're going to have to make their views known.
[02:33:33.224 --> 02:33:38.347]  I mean, that's about the only way we can, because we're outgunned up there by the pharmaceutical industry.
[02:33:38.408 --> 02:33:40.349]  They have just incredible power and money.
[02:33:40.848 --> 02:33:45.852]  And also medical organizations, which are also lobbying for this bill.
[02:33:46.212 --> 02:33:47.213]  Well, I mean, you said it.
[02:33:47.233 --> 02:33:49.255]  I want to make something clear here.
[02:33:49.675 --> 02:34:03.987]  Remember earlier this year they passed the New Freedom Initiative, the Orwellian term, for forced psychological testing and drugging of all school-aged children, forced testing for all, drugging of many, and the drug company's own internal documents said this was about money.
[02:34:04.007 --> 02:34:06.208]  We're going to be able to put half the kids on drugs now.
[02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:10.412]  I mean, literally, they just bought our politicians that command our police.
[02:34:10.652 --> 02:34:13.334]  And they're just going to show up and demand we take Redland and Prozac.
[02:34:13.394 --> 02:34:18.639]  I mean, so now they're just going to demand... I mean, imagine owning a business where you make people buy your product.
[02:34:19.059 --> 02:34:22.082]  It's amazing because, of course, there's no liability attached.
[02:34:22.102 --> 02:34:25.525]  You talk about a stockholder's dream and a consumer's worst nightmare.
[02:34:25.945 --> 02:34:36.114]  And I've always said, you know, that until the cop with the nurse and the syringe and the gun comes to your door, Americans are not going to wake up and realize...
[02:34:36.836 --> 02:34:38.337]  The freedoms that we've given away.
[02:34:38.437 --> 02:34:45.339]  Now, one of the things is that public health laws, including those laws governing vaccination, have always been state laws.
[02:34:45.719 --> 02:34:46.059]  Why?
[02:34:46.339 --> 02:34:47.139]  Because in the U.S.
[02:34:47.199 --> 02:34:52.141]  Constitution, anything that was not defined as a federal activity defaulted to the state.
[02:34:52.221 --> 02:35:00.944]  So you're right that there's no federal law compelling vaccination yet, but there are state laws in the different states
[02:35:01.666 --> 02:35:06.041]  However, there have been exemptions that so far they've allowed people to get.
[02:35:06.161 --> 02:35:08.469]  But this is a big step in knocking that out.
[02:35:09.693 --> 02:35:11.334]  It started with Homeland Security.
[02:35:11.774 --> 02:35:19.877]  Yes, the Homeland Security law was the first time that the feds started to intrude upon the state's rights in this area.
[02:35:20.157 --> 02:35:25.659]  And people say that Homeland Security doesn't affect me, Patriot Act doesn't affect me.
[02:35:25.879 --> 02:35:27.059]  Yes, it does, folks.
[02:35:27.819 --> 02:35:37.963]  It does, and what the bigger plan is, of course, is once they can get all liability removed from those who make vaccines and drugs, those who give them to you,
[02:35:38.969 --> 02:35:40.070]  Well, I'll just say this.
[02:35:40.090 --> 02:35:42.172]  That's why they gave us the Second Amendment.
[02:36:01.716 --> 02:36:08.661]  Yeah, and we also have the Seventh Amendment, which is our right to a trial by jury in front of a jury of our peers.
[02:36:09.282 --> 02:36:12.704]  This legislation totally destroys the Seventh Amendment.
[02:36:12.784 --> 02:36:16.607]  Did you know that the former top CIA analyst for Ronald Reagan and Bush Sr.
[02:36:16.627 --> 02:36:21.210]  says the government may carry out terror attacks and set up martial law?
[02:36:21.490 --> 02:36:27.575]  Did you know Ron Paul said the government wants to use this vaccine system to declare martial law and get our guns?
[02:36:28.275 --> 02:36:36.043]  So many prominent people are now saying we are actually becoming a commie Nazi system.
[02:36:36.143 --> 02:36:41.327]  America really is going into a total dictatorship very soon.
[02:36:42.669 --> 02:36:53.659]  You know, I never thought I would feel that our country is in danger and that we have so eroded the fundamental principles of the Constitution when it comes to civil liberties.
[02:36:54.224 --> 02:37:03.667]  And I mean, our founders came here because they were fleeing from oppression by, you know, kings and queens.
[02:37:03.687 --> 02:37:10.029]  But that British oppression isn't a thimble, I mean, just compared to this washtub of evil we're now seeing.
[02:37:10.049 --> 02:37:17.532]  Well, certainly if we cannot have control over what we put in our bodies, in the bodies of our children, we can in no sense be free.
[02:37:18.392 --> 02:37:19.933]  In my opinion, this is a human right.
[02:37:20.518 --> 02:37:28.466]  Well, Barbara, why don't you tell people what they found in the vaccines confirmed?
[02:37:28.526 --> 02:37:29.907]  I mean, everything you can imagine.
[02:37:30.427 --> 02:37:32.289]  Well, it is distressing.
[02:37:32.750 --> 02:37:37.374]  When you go and you do the research and you find out how vaccines are made and you find that...
[02:37:37.714 --> 02:37:44.860]  You know, they're using animal cell substrates like monkey kidney cells to make vaccines.
[02:37:44.940 --> 02:37:46.061]  We had a problem.
[02:37:46.101 --> 02:37:52.667]  A lot of people don't realize that the polio vaccine, both the killed and live polio, was contaminated with a monkey virus that is now
[02:37:53.587 --> 02:37:54.288]  Yeah, you know, it's...
[02:38:22.601 --> 02:38:39.008]  I think that there's just been this sort of blind spot with Congress and with the public about vaccines because there's been this incredible promotion that the polio vaccine, the smallpox vaccine, and all these vaccines have saved humanity from infectious diseases.
[02:38:39.048 --> 02:38:41.669]  And now they're openly saying, hey, we're not going to clean them up.
[02:38:41.750 --> 02:38:43.710]  In fact, we're going to make them as dirty as we want.
[02:38:44.131 --> 02:38:47.692]  Well, unfortunately, with this liability protection, they can do whatever they want to.
[02:38:47.732 --> 02:38:48.993]  And the other thing about this bill...
[02:38:50.497 --> 02:38:59.425]  That Senate Bill 1873 is that they are setting up this entity that is going to keep secret from the people.
[02:38:59.485 --> 02:39:01.427]  You can't under the Freedom of Information Act
[02:39:01.812 --> 02:39:05.755]  Get any information about the way these vaccines and drugs are made.
[02:39:05.775 --> 02:39:10.179]  Yeah, keeping science and reporting and all of this secret.
[02:39:10.439 --> 02:39:11.660]  A secret holocaust.
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:22.748]  Yeah, and so the problem is you'll never be able to go to court to prove, like with the tobacco companies, you need to be able to go into court and hold industries.
[02:39:22.968 --> 02:39:26.311]  Now Bush already gave Eli Lilly protection, but we got that stripped.
[02:39:27.052 --> 02:39:28.932]  In the Homeland Security Bill, yes.
[02:39:28.992 --> 02:39:39.955]  We organized a call-in campaign and a fax campaign, and we got the thimerosal rider that protected the makers of the thimerosal, the mercury preservatives and vaccines.
[02:39:40.275 --> 02:39:41.235]  That was knocked out.
[02:39:41.335 --> 02:39:42.556]  But see, they've come around.
[02:39:42.616 --> 02:39:47.317]  They waited, and now they're going to achieve what they did not achieve in Homeland Security.
[02:39:47.337 --> 02:39:48.717]  They're going to achieve what this piece of work did.
[02:39:48.737 --> 02:39:51.158]  And people wonder why you never hear this on the nightly news.
[02:39:51.398 --> 02:39:52.558]  Half the advertisers...
[02:39:53.478 --> 02:40:00.383]  I've already said this just from watching TV, but I've seen reports, news reports, and industry publications on advertising expenditures.
[02:40:01.143 --> 02:40:07.848]  About half of, in your average newscast, right around half of the ads are drug maker ads.
[02:40:08.439 --> 02:40:10.260]  And they all have their vaccine division.
[02:40:10.320 --> 02:40:14.824]  So literally, half the news budget is being paid for by the drug makers.
[02:40:15.164 --> 02:40:16.465]  They're buying up everything.
[02:40:16.665 --> 02:40:17.265]  Well, just think.
[02:40:17.305 --> 02:40:28.113]  If you have a product that is mandated to be used by every single citizen born in this country... But the media won't expose it because half their money, half their profits are from the drug makers.
[02:40:28.693 --> 02:40:35.318]  I don't know what... You know, the only thing I can... What we need to do is, as citizens, we need to stand up.
[02:40:35.686 --> 02:40:37.547]  And we need to get to our elected representatives.
[02:40:37.647 --> 02:40:42.350]  And if our elected representatives won't listen to what we say, we have to elect new representatives.
[02:40:42.370 --> 02:40:44.371]  Well, we've got to have recalls about this.
[02:40:45.131 --> 02:40:50.474]  Barbara, continuing here, trying to look at this big picture of what we're facing.
[02:40:52.560 --> 02:41:03.225]  People need to realize there are 200 vaccines in the research pipeline that are literally being developed to prevent every single infectious disease you can think of.
[02:41:03.706 --> 02:41:12.290]  There's never been any research into whether preventing all illness in childhood and as adults is really good for us.
[02:41:12.370 --> 02:41:16.052]  Obviously, we've had illness on this earth since man walked the earth.
[02:41:16.823 --> 02:41:25.629]  You know, there are some scientists and physicians who are thinking independently and saying maybe getting sick once in a while is not bad for you, but it's actually good for you.
[02:41:25.650 --> 02:41:30.753]  Well, it's just like antibiotics has now given rise to superbugs that, you know, eat your skin.
[02:41:30.793 --> 02:41:39.179]  And I know people who have been on antibiotics for 10 years, they're totally unhappy, and they can't get off of them now because they don't have an immune system, and now it isn't even working for them.
[02:41:39.219 --> 02:41:39.580]  But look...
[02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:40.720]  That's the thing.
[02:41:40.780 --> 02:41:44.201]  Right now, they try to push about 45 vaccines on your kids.
[02:41:44.641 --> 02:41:45.461]  Ten years ago, it was 30.
[02:41:45.881 --> 02:41:47.461]  Ten years before that, it was 15.
[02:41:47.922 --> 02:41:58.063]  They're now talking about making your child take hundreds of shots, literally on a daily basis, injectors filled with every toxin you can imagine.
[02:41:58.944 --> 02:41:59.904]  This is unbelievable.
[02:41:59.964 --> 02:42:02.064]  I mean, this is like a science fiction horror movie.
[02:42:02.384 --> 02:42:06.145]  Well, I'm afraid people are going to have to wake up and see that just because...
[02:42:06.826 --> 02:42:11.032]  The smallpox vaccine eradicated smallpox, and polio vaccine took polio out.
[02:42:11.112 --> 02:42:15.719]  It doesn't mean that we have to use a vaccine for literally every disease known to man.
[02:42:16.720 --> 02:42:20.386]  They're not doing the proper scientific research that needs to be done to look at this.
[02:42:20.805 --> 02:42:27.630]  Well, they even admit that they have a vaccine to stop kids having earaches, but they admit that the vaccine is very dangerous.
[02:42:27.650 --> 02:42:32.833]  They have the meningitis shot, but they admit that's a very dangerous shot and doesn't even protect you in all cases.
[02:42:44.012 --> 02:42:45.917]  We've got hepatitis B vaccine.
[02:42:45.957 --> 02:42:48.666]  They're given to 12-hour-old infants in the newborn nursery.
[02:42:48.766 --> 02:42:51.193]  Even though hepatitis B is an adult disease.
[02:42:51.667 --> 02:42:52.988]  Did you hear about England?
[02:42:53.008 --> 02:42:54.289]  Did you hear about England?
[02:42:54.309 --> 02:42:54.629]  I'm sure you did.
[02:42:54.649 --> 02:43:02.654]  They also, it was barely defeated, they wanted to pass a law to give every child in England an injection of a vaccine with a live virus that was actually going to attack
[02:43:17.825 --> 02:43:26.630]  Key nerve centers in the brain to, quote, cure children so they would never use cocaine, heroin, nicotine, or any other opiate.
[02:43:26.650 --> 02:43:27.650]  Right.
[02:43:27.691 --> 02:43:33.974]  Folks, imagine a vaccine with a virus that actually creates a type of chemical lobotomy.
[02:43:34.154 --> 02:43:35.475]  That's a science fiction movie, folks.
[02:43:35.515 --> 02:43:36.435]  That's Brave New World.
[02:43:37.556 --> 02:43:37.996]  You're right.
[02:43:38.016 --> 02:43:41.118]  There's an anti-cocaine vaccine there.
[02:43:41.478 --> 02:43:42.179]  I'm telling you.
[02:43:42.219 --> 02:43:43.980]  But it actually attacks the brain.
[02:43:44.280 --> 02:43:46.461]  They have a science fiction movie out about that right now.
[02:43:47.432 --> 02:43:53.635]  Well, I just think we have given too much power to MDs and PhDs who choose to become scientists and physicians.
[02:43:53.875 --> 02:43:59.278]  Well, some cop tries to come to my door and injected me with some kind of thing that attacks my brain.
[02:43:59.378 --> 02:44:01.399]  I mean, this is insane!
[02:44:01.859 --> 02:44:11.965]  Well, I think people just don't understand because so many of these laws are passed quietly, and that's one of the reasons that our organization, and we've been doing this vaccine safety work for 23 years,
[02:44:12.972 --> 02:44:16.456]  Put out the press release and said, you know, people wake up.
[02:44:16.636 --> 02:44:17.457]  See what's happened.
[02:44:17.797 --> 02:44:19.239]  You need to take back your country.
[02:44:19.299 --> 02:44:21.842]  You need to take back your Constitution.
[02:44:22.598 --> 02:44:29.684]  And you can only do that by going and holding the elected officials accountable for the votes that they make.
[02:44:30.124 --> 02:44:34.608]  You need to monitor what your elected official at the state and federal level is doing.
[02:44:34.968 --> 02:44:35.949]  Find out what they're doing.
[02:44:35.989 --> 02:44:37.150]  Find out who gives the money.
[02:44:37.930 --> 02:44:43.014]  You can find that out by going on the Internet and see who gives your elected official money.
[02:44:43.474 --> 02:44:47.698]  And then if you don't like what they're doing in Washington or in your state capitol, you need to vote them out.
[02:44:49.068 --> 02:44:49.908]  Get your own people in there.
[02:44:49.929 --> 02:44:54.371]  But I thought we fought the British so we could forcibly inject our children with hundreds of toxins.
[02:44:55.391 --> 02:44:58.253]  I'm sure that our founders are turning over in their graves.
[02:44:58.313 --> 02:44:59.954]  They wouldn't believe.
[02:44:59.974 --> 02:45:00.714]  They really wouldn't.
[02:45:01.094 --> 02:45:02.555]  Okay, well, we know it passed the Senate.
[02:45:02.595 --> 02:45:03.736]  What's the House bill number?
[02:45:04.841 --> 02:45:09.462]  I don't have the house bill number in front of me here, but they can go to our website.
[02:45:09.482 --> 02:45:10.503]  We'll be updating that.
[02:45:10.783 --> 02:45:14.404]  We have a portion on our website, and we'll get that new house number in there.
[02:45:14.724 --> 02:45:17.124]  That's nvic.org.
[02:45:17.264 --> 02:45:17.885]  That's correct.
[02:45:18.045 --> 02:45:19.245]  nvic.org.
[02:45:19.285 --> 02:45:20.865]  I know I've been jumping in a lot, Barbara.
[02:45:20.925 --> 02:45:23.006]  It's just that it freaks me out.
[02:45:23.326 --> 02:45:23.586]  I know.
[02:45:23.626 --> 02:45:26.107]  I mean, when I'm reading London Telegraph articles that are...
[02:45:27.478 --> 02:45:28.018]  We're good to go.
[02:45:48.030 --> 02:45:50.792]  At work, or your wife has that first child.
[02:45:51.133 --> 02:45:59.399]  I mean, if they destroy the receptors in the brain for those pleasures, those drugs simply mimic natural receptor points.
[02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:01.161]  Yeah, it's Brave New World.
[02:46:02.042 --> 02:46:04.804]  I don't know if you've ever heard Aldress Huxley's Brave New World.
[02:46:04.884 --> 02:46:05.825]  Yes, yes.
[02:46:05.845 --> 02:46:08.767]  But it's very unsettling.
[02:46:09.228 --> 02:46:16.874]  And I think, again, people have got to be more aware, and they need to vote people into their state legislatures and into Congress
[02:46:17.259 --> 02:46:20.100]  To understand that we do not want pharma running our lives.
[02:46:20.640 --> 02:46:27.623]  We don't want public health officials in pharma with too much power and too much money telling us what to put in our bodies.
[02:46:27.924 --> 02:46:29.904]  Well, we've got to defeat the bill.
[02:46:30.044 --> 02:46:33.686]  Congress set to pass law eliminating liability for vaccine injuries.
[02:46:34.306 --> 02:46:37.447]  And in the Senate it was S-1873.
[02:46:37.488 --> 02:46:40.889]  We'll get that up on our website, the new House bill.
[02:46:41.511 --> 02:46:42.772]  All right, it just went to the House.
[02:46:42.792 --> 02:46:43.452]  It was S-1873.
[02:46:43.552 --> 02:46:49.554]  It's passed the Senate Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act.
[02:46:49.574 --> 02:46:50.015]  That's right.
[02:46:50.195 --> 02:46:51.295]  And that will be the name of the House.
[02:46:51.435 --> 02:46:55.397]  Just look for Bio and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act.
[02:46:56.017 --> 02:46:57.858]  And, Barbara, I want to commend you for coming on.
[02:46:57.878 --> 02:47:04.561]  Folks, you need to go to your website, nvic.org, nvic.org.
[02:47:05.101 --> 02:47:06.341]  And you better get involved.
[02:47:06.522 --> 02:47:07.602]  Barbara, thank you for coming on.
[02:47:07.882 --> 02:47:08.402]  Thank you.
[02:47:08.582 --> 02:47:08.883]  Bye-bye.
[02:47:08.963 --> 02:47:09.363]  God bless.
[02:47:09.403 --> 02:47:09.743]  Take care.
[02:47:10.430 --> 02:47:12.131]  Folks, this isn't a joke, okay?
[02:47:12.812 --> 02:47:15.173]  Type in pharmacological crops.
[02:47:15.193 --> 02:47:16.054]  They're going to put it in the food.
[02:47:16.074 --> 02:47:18.375]  They already have it.
[02:47:18.675 --> 02:47:21.537]  They have developed vaccines that they're looking at in the U.S.
[02:47:21.617 --> 02:47:31.824]  and that they tried to pass a law last year in England by law to make you take a vaccine where the virus actually creates a plaque.
[02:47:32.864 --> 02:47:33.585]  A plaque.
[02:47:35.206 --> 02:47:37.047]  It actually goes in, tailored,
[02:47:37.691 --> 02:47:43.232]  And the virus plugs into your receptor sites and actually kills brain cells.
[02:47:43.332 --> 02:47:44.093]  I can't believe this.
[02:47:44.773 --> 02:47:48.133]  I mean, we're talking actual brain engineering.
[02:47:48.914 --> 02:47:54.515]  You want to know what all this technology and the $700 hammers have been spent on in the Pentagon?
[02:47:54.755 --> 02:47:56.976]  You know, it didn't really go into hammers.
[02:47:57.176 --> 02:48:01.057]  It is actual stuff where they give you a shot and, man, you are mindless.
[02:48:01.537 --> 02:48:03.057]  After that, you're just like a zombie.
[02:48:03.737 --> 02:48:05.558]  And they're going to be coming by in their black mask.
[02:48:05.878 --> 02:48:07.218]  Laugh at me like you did about everything else.
[02:48:07.839 --> 02:48:10.701]  If we don't stop them in 10 years, they're going to be coming around even sooner.
[02:48:11.041 --> 02:48:14.823]  And then black mask with, Rogue Leader 17, go in, move in, move in!
[02:48:15.103 --> 02:48:16.564]  Take your shot now, you're with us now.
[02:48:16.744 --> 02:48:18.425]  Join us, join us, now you're with us.
[02:48:18.665 --> 02:48:20.506]  Yes, yes, now you're with us.
[02:48:20.726 --> 02:48:22.247]  Now you're with the world leader now.
[02:48:22.768 --> 02:48:26.830]  I mean, these people are psychopathic occult sickos.
[02:48:26.870 --> 02:48:27.911]  Go read the London Telegraph.
[02:48:28.091 --> 02:48:29.011]  Go read the BBC.
[02:48:29.171 --> 02:48:33.634]  They almost passed a law to actually lobotomize every child in England.
[02:48:34.762 --> 02:48:35.784]  I'm not joking.
[02:48:35.844 --> 02:48:39.409]  We are just living in absolute insanity.
[02:48:40.570 --> 02:48:43.034]  Normal people respond to it like I am.
[02:48:46.397 --> 02:48:53.784]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.045 --> 02:48:58.809]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.009 --> 02:49:04.675]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:04.895 --> 02:49:09.439]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:09.639 --> 02:49:16.805]  The casual society control grid, impalpable microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:16.825 --> 02:49:21.369]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:21.529 --> 02:49:24.031]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.271 --> 02:49:31.017]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[02:50:35.621 --> 02:50:36.882]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:50:46.368 --> 02:50:52.317]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:52.537 --> 02:50:54.800]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[02:50:54.981 --> 02:51:01.350]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,

[02:51:21.954 --> 02:51:22.534]  We're good to go.
[02:51:47.637 --> 02:51:56.426]  A few months ago, I saw a trailer for a science fiction movie where the government makes you take a shot of a virus that then makes you behave yourself.
[02:51:56.506 --> 02:52:00.290]  It goes in and eats your brain, eats certain... And of course, that's real!
[02:52:00.370 --> 02:52:03.373]  They're actually about to pass laws to make us take it!
[02:52:03.553 --> 02:52:06.095]  I mean, see, that's why I'm freaking out here, folks!
[02:52:06.296 --> 02:52:07.377]  It's so bad!
[02:52:08.024 --> 02:52:10.505]  I mean, the cops out there, they're going to brain damage your kids.
[02:52:10.585 --> 02:52:10.945]  I know.
[02:52:11.145 --> 02:52:13.545]  You'll just roll their sleeves up and let them hurt your children.
[02:52:13.866 --> 02:52:15.726]  You believe the system so good.
[02:52:15.946 --> 02:52:17.086]  You're so brainwashed.
[02:52:17.106 --> 02:52:18.307]  You're so stupid.
[02:52:18.927 --> 02:52:21.928]  And you yuppies out there, and all of you, you make me sick.
[02:52:22.748 --> 02:52:24.949]  And in the movie Serenity, that's the message.
[02:52:24.969 --> 02:52:29.570]  The government's really secretly trying to make people sedative.
[02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:34.651]  I haven't seen the movie Equilibrium, but John Harmon, running the show, keeps telling me to see it.
[02:52:34.971 --> 02:52:36.672]  John, what does Equilibrium talk about?
[02:52:36.692 --> 02:52:37.552]  I'm going to take a few calls.
[02:52:38.212 --> 02:52:49.944]  Yeah, basically everyone's forced to take this drug that... Emotions are banned in the future because emotions result in anger and violence and all that stuff.
[02:52:50.225 --> 02:52:56.211]  So everyone is turned into mindless zombies to ensure peace.
[02:52:56.770 --> 02:53:05.036]  Which Aldous Huxley said his brother was UN Secretary General of UNESCO, but he wrote it back in the 30s before the UN even existed.
[02:53:05.076 --> 02:53:09.919]  He said in a speech in 1962 at Berkeley that I've aired here, no, this is the real plan.
[02:53:09.999 --> 02:53:11.360]  I've worked with the global government.
[02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:13.101]  My book is about our plan.
[02:53:13.561 --> 02:53:16.443]  So you go, well, why is what the book says what they're doing?
[02:53:16.603 --> 02:53:18.985]  Because it's an actual plan, people!
[02:53:19.445 --> 02:53:20.326]  Listen to me!
[02:53:20.846 --> 02:53:22.887]  Soylent Green is made out of people!
[02:53:23.087 --> 02:53:24.268]  It's that equivalent, okay?
[02:53:24.428 --> 02:53:25.269]  It's that level!
[02:53:25.908 --> 02:53:28.729]  They're so close to the troops and the injectors.
[02:53:29.129 --> 02:53:30.289]  And Ron Paul won't care anymore.
[02:53:30.349 --> 02:53:31.609]  Once they get him, he'll be on the news.
[02:53:31.829 --> 02:53:32.490]  Everything is fine.
[02:53:32.550 --> 02:53:33.390]  I've had my injection.
[02:53:33.450 --> 02:53:34.430]  I love the global leader.
[02:53:34.690 --> 02:53:36.430]  I mean, folks, this is not a joke.
[02:53:36.631 --> 02:53:39.831]  You realize we're in a science fiction horror movie.
[02:53:40.011 --> 02:53:41.692]  All you can do is fight at that point.
[02:53:41.992 --> 02:53:51.194]  When these dumb, dumb, dumb cops come with stupid troops who've all had their injections and all are following orders now, they're all going to be feeling fine.
[02:53:53.348 --> 02:54:02.056]  Go to InfoWars.com, get the new book Codex Magicka, get my film Martial Law, make a thousand copies, run around screaming, wake everybody up, freak out, pull your hair out.
[02:54:02.356 --> 02:54:04.077]  That's the normal response to this stuff.
[02:54:04.898 --> 02:54:06.119]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:54:06.139 --> 02:54:11.964]  They're going to make a law to forcibly inject us in no liability with just all this garbage, and it's going to be incrementally done.
[02:54:11.984 --> 02:54:16.628]  Let's talk to Alex in Mass that Joseph in England has been holding for five million years.
[02:54:16.668 --> 02:54:17.229]  Go ahead, Alex.
[02:54:18.874 --> 02:54:19.194]  Quickly!
[02:54:19.614 --> 02:54:21.315]  Oh, hey, I'm from North Carolina.
[02:54:21.435 --> 02:54:22.595]  Was there an Alex from Mass?
[02:54:23.055 --> 02:54:23.856]  It doesn't matter.
[02:54:23.896 --> 02:54:24.116]  Go ahead.
[02:54:24.156 --> 02:54:24.936]  It doesn't matter?
[02:54:25.336 --> 02:54:25.456]  Okay.
[02:54:26.376 --> 02:54:36.600]  Well, you know, for 15 years or so, I've been aware of and incrementally of various things you talk about on the show, and I've always thought that I've done a good job of finding out about it and trying to protect myself and my family.
[02:54:37.300 --> 02:54:46.583]  Until I learned recently that I guess I'm a complete moron because I've been poisoning myself for the last 25 years, and I've been doing it with dental amalgam.
[02:54:48.102 --> 02:54:54.888]  Let me tell you, dental amalgam isn't one one-billionth as bad as these vaccines.
[02:54:55.869 --> 02:54:56.249]  Oh, okay.
[02:54:56.269 --> 02:54:57.670]  Well, I guess that's good.
[02:54:57.690 --> 02:54:59.972]  I'm having all of them out, you know, as soon as I can.
[02:55:00.052 --> 02:55:12.582]  But it's unsettling, though, to know that, like, for example, I looked online and I found the material data safety sheet for a product called Dispersaloid.
[02:55:13.628 --> 02:55:15.990]  Yeah, no, the actual literature says it's dangerous.
[02:55:16.130 --> 02:55:17.051]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:17.211 --> 02:55:18.873]  I'm sorry we're out of time.
[02:55:18.893 --> 02:55:19.493]  Joseph in England.
[02:55:19.533 --> 02:55:21.135]  Go ahead, Joseph.
[02:55:37.307 --> 02:55:45.371]  Yeah, I was just going to say, Equilibrium is a good film, but if you want to see a film that really describes the New World Order, there's a good one with Ewan McGregor called The Island you've got to see.
[02:55:45.631 --> 02:55:46.352]  Oh, I saw that.
[02:55:46.372 --> 02:55:47.312]  Yeah, The Island's great.
[02:55:47.872 --> 02:55:51.614]  I was just going to read a quick headline out of the UK Daily Mirror.
[02:55:51.774 --> 02:55:54.015]  Our envoy loses satellite phone.
[02:55:54.115 --> 02:55:55.596]  Iraqi rebels find it.
[02:55:55.716 --> 02:56:01.599]  Run up a £500,000 bill calling Al-Qaeda in Yemen and Saudi Arabia, if you can believe that.
[02:56:01.719 --> 02:56:02.940]  I never covered that.
[02:56:02.980 --> 02:56:04.541]  More proof Al-Qaeda is MI6 CIA.
[02:56:06.348 --> 02:56:06.848]  Absolutely.
[02:56:07.008 --> 02:56:07.728]  You're absolutely right.
[02:56:07.768 --> 02:56:08.848]  It's in the stack.
[02:56:08.888 --> 02:56:09.549]  I didn't get to it.
[02:56:10.429 --> 02:56:10.949]  I'm sorry.
[02:56:11.729 --> 02:56:12.769]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:12.789 --> 02:56:13.729]  We'll talk more, okay?
[02:56:14.289 --> 02:56:14.710]  Okay.
[02:56:14.990 --> 02:56:19.410]  Joseph, and that goes for John and everybody else, and to Alex and all of you.
[02:56:19.430 --> 02:56:20.271]  Just great callers.
[02:56:20.311 --> 02:56:21.211]  God bless you all.
[02:56:25.552 --> 02:56:29.472]  If you would like a copy of this show, come to GCNlive.com and reserve it today.
[02:56:29.792 --> 02:56:30.592]  Or call toll-free 877-376-45.
