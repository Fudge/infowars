[00:00:05.486 --> 00:00:06.146]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.787 --> 00:00:07.867]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.567 --> 00:00:09.687]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.307 --> 00:00:11.127]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.888 --> 00:00:12.788]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.448 --> 00:00:17.409]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.629 --> 00:00:21.750]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.614 --> 00:00:34.237]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.058 --> 00:00:40.924]  It is Friday, the 18th day of November 2005, headed into the weekend.
[00:00:40.944 --> 00:00:44.548]  Then, of course, the Thanksgiving week coming up next Thursday.
[00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:49.794]  Hope you spend time with your family and think about what this country is really all about.
[00:00:49.834 --> 00:00:50.855]  I know that's what I'll be doing.
[00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:56.302]  But obviously we'll be here Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and then take off Thursday to be with family.
[00:00:56.763 --> 00:00:58.625]  I'll even be filling in, I'm told.
[00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:05.731]  I've been honored to be asked to fill in for Pastor Butch Paugh coming up next Monday on his show.
[00:01:06.152 --> 00:01:10.456]  Now for the last year I've been unable to hear Pastor Butch's show here locally on the stations,
[00:01:11.526 --> 00:01:18.549]  There's been some lobbying, including by myself, and now we get to hear Pastor Butch on the radio again here in Austin.
[00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.070]  Now, why am I starting a radio show with that?
[00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.870]  I don't know.
[00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.951]  I was just thinking about Butch.
[00:01:23.673 --> 00:01:25.915]  Right before I went on air, he's calling me all the time.
[00:01:25.935 --> 00:01:27.316]  I never have time to call him back.
[00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:31.979]  I was thinking about books this morning because I was reading an email that he sent somebody else.
[00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:46.288]  They forwarded me, and he was quoting Dante's Inferno about the hottest places in hell being reserved for those that know something wrong is happening, that know that innocent people are being abused, and they decide to be neutral.
[00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:50.773]  Neutrality is bad, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:55.536]  Christ said that you were neither hot nor cold, so I spit you out of my mouth.
[00:01:57.157 --> 00:01:59.458]  I actually respect the evil Satanists.
[00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:00.499]  I don't like them.
[00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:01.100]  I hate them.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.921]  I want to bring them down, but I respect them.
[00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:04.622]  They know what they're doing.
[00:02:04.662 --> 00:02:06.783]  They know which side they've chosen.
[00:02:07.043 --> 00:02:10.005]  They've cast their lot with the old serpent.
[00:02:10.606 --> 00:02:16.850]  But you've got these other people out there that know about good and evil, but they just decide to kind of namby-pamby
[00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:18.309]  We're good to go.
[00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:57.681]  Convicted that Joseph Smith character, the famous video in Florida, a few years ago where he just grabs a little, I don't know, ten-year-old girl and kidnaps her and ties her up and rapes her for four days and strangles her.
[00:02:59.982 --> 00:03:02.664]  Just the level of evil that's out there.
[00:03:03.244 --> 00:03:05.165]  We have to stop denying it.
[00:03:06.065 --> 00:03:07.466]  We've got to face it.
[00:03:07.906 --> 00:03:08.626]  It's real.
[00:03:09.927 --> 00:03:11.427]  And it's growing in power.
[00:03:11.507 --> 00:03:12.508]  It's spreading.
[00:03:13.547 --> 00:03:25.996]  Every form of degeneracy, every form of wickedness, every form of twisted behavior is exploding right now like a wild fever running through the body politic.
[00:03:27.117 --> 00:03:33.182]  It's just burning away everything good and decent and it's all under attack.
[00:03:33.242 --> 00:03:38.306]  Everything good is threatened right now like never before in human history.
[00:03:38.946 --> 00:03:41.148]  Evil has tools it's never dreamed of.
[00:03:42.348 --> 00:03:51.675]  The mechanisms of enslavement and despotism are mighty, but at the same time, for every action there is a greater or equal reaction.
[00:03:53.156 --> 00:03:57.038]  And there is a lot of resistance mounting to this.
[00:03:57.398 --> 00:03:58.960]  There is just a ton of news.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.904]  I got an email here saying, Alex, I don't see the proof of the FDA testing on people.
[00:04:05.524 --> 00:04:11.088]  They're approving rules for the testing on foster children, handicapped children,
[00:04:12.174 --> 00:04:21.680]  And, uh, S. Fieldman sent me this email saying everything Alex has ever said I've checked up and it's been backed up, but he says, I just can't find out where this is true.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:27.103]  Well, okay, sir, we'll go over some of that for you here today.
[00:04:27.143 --> 00:04:37.270]  I mean, if you don't know that there's been chemical, biological, and radiological testing on children in America for 70 plus years, you're not looking very hard.
[00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:40.872]  And this is just a codification publicly.
[00:04:41.551 --> 00:04:47.534]  So we'll go back into this when we start the second segment and then... There's just so much news.
[00:04:48.034 --> 00:04:50.275]  Bush's approval rating falls to even a lower level.
[00:04:50.495 --> 00:04:55.717]  I mean, if he keeps falling at this rate, he'll have an approval rating of like 10 points by the middle of next year.
[00:04:55.777 --> 00:04:56.317]  Seriously.
[00:04:56.577 --> 00:04:57.178]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:02.293 --> 00:05:05.154]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:05:05.415 --> 00:05:06.975]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:07.335 --> 00:05:11.998]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[00:05:12.338 --> 00:05:19.061]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:21.402]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[00:05:21.582 --> 00:05:24.443]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[00:05:24.543 --> 00:05:29.204]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[00:05:29.384 --> 00:05:33.806]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:41.268]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:43.929]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[00:06:02.975 --> 00:06:04.015]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:06:04.336 --> 00:06:07.117]  Will it be fought overseas, or will it affect us here at home?
[00:06:07.397 --> 00:06:11.558]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:12.819]  So what do you do?
[00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:17.681]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:06:18.181 --> 00:06:20.322]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:06:20.802 --> 00:06:21.702]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:06:22.082 --> 00:06:25.803]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:06:26.123 --> 00:06:35.485]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:35.925]  government.

[00:07:01.477 --> 00:07:08.344]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:07:08.484 --> 00:07:21.378]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Sobe, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:07:21.698 --> 00:07:23.399]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:07:23.559 --> 00:07:27.021]  Are you tired of working so hard yet feeling like you'll never get ahead?
[00:07:27.301 --> 00:07:31.083]  Are you ready to start investing in your own business instead of somebody else's?
[00:07:31.343 --> 00:07:36.306]  Whatever it is you seek, Zango could be the special company that helps you achieve your hopes and dreams.
[00:07:36.586 --> 00:07:38.287]  So take matters into your own hands.
[00:07:38.547 --> 00:07:42.551]  Create a future that doesn't depend on a fickle 401k and lateral promotions.

[00:08:02.003 --> 00:08:07.626]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.448 --> 00:08:23.854]  Life is short, it is transitory, it is like the morning mist at dawn, when the first rays of the sun hit it, it disappears in seconds.
[00:08:24.694 --> 00:08:28.816]  Right as you begin to grasp your life and
[00:08:29.838 --> 00:08:31.560]  Many cases it's over.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.725]  It's over in a flash, or it's over in excruciating pain over many months, but death will find us all.
[00:08:40.987 --> 00:08:51.816]  But death of a great-grandparent or a grandparent, it's painful, it's sad, but it's part of the human condition.
[00:08:51.956 --> 00:08:54.839]  It's the way we're designed.
[00:08:55.379 --> 00:08:56.760]  We are equipped with
[00:08:58.169 --> 00:09:08.816]  The instincts to be able to deal with it, better than losing a child, a lot better than losing a brother or a sister.
[00:09:10.097 --> 00:09:21.525]  People are meant to live out their life cycle, to be little babies and to be loved and then to become adolescents and be rebellious and leave the hut and go set up your own hut and start your own family.
[00:09:22.575 --> 00:09:29.717]  Have your own children and then become grandparents and if you're blessed become great-grandparents and then go back into the earth, go back into dust.
[00:09:32.778 --> 00:09:44.822]  But we should all appreciate life every time we see the night sky, every time we see the sunset, every time we see a happy family that's straight and strong and filled with joy.
[00:09:45.602 --> 00:09:49.664]  Every time we see a flock of birds land
[00:09:50.916 --> 00:09:51.696]  Land and a lake.
[00:09:51.756 --> 00:09:53.656]  Just all of that beauty.
[00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:54.897]  All of that purity.
[00:09:55.077 --> 00:09:57.617]  All of the things we see in God's creation.
[00:09:57.677 --> 00:09:58.497]  All the good things.
[00:09:58.537 --> 00:10:04.798]  We have to appreciate the good things so that we can stand up for them against the bad things.
[00:10:04.818 --> 00:10:07.419]  We need to be able to separate the good from the bad.
[00:10:07.459 --> 00:10:09.779]  And so many people are unable to do that.
[00:10:09.899 --> 00:10:12.880]  So many people are lured by evil.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.500]  They are seduced by evil.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.281]  They think that darkness and death is beautiful.
[00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:19.681]  They are beguiled by it.
[00:10:20.718 --> 00:10:24.161]  And all they'll find is pain and suffering down that road.
[00:10:24.982 --> 00:10:27.604]  And you will find it down that road prematurely.
[00:10:27.744 --> 00:10:31.127]  Don't worry, you're going to find pain and suffering in your life.
[00:10:31.888 --> 00:10:38.313]  And a lot of times you find even greater pain and suffering when you do try to avoid it.
[00:10:38.333 --> 00:10:42.377]  Now there is such a thing as necessary suffering in this world.
[00:10:44.071 --> 00:10:54.662]  And much of the problems we see today are because we try to do what's quick and what's easy and what only satisfies our flesh, our base instincts.
[00:10:55.883 --> 00:11:01.609]  But history shows us and the history of societies and civilizations shows us clearly
[00:11:03.689 --> 00:11:14.752]  That when people stand up and are involved, and are aggressive, and are dynamic, and are passionate, and are loving, and are individualistic, you have milk and honey.
[00:11:14.792 --> 00:11:16.513]  You have dynamic societies.
[00:11:17.353 --> 00:11:19.854]  But history shows, just like a fine Swiss watch,
[00:11:20.772 --> 00:11:33.834]  Right on time that the children of those pioneers tend to be a little less self-sufficient, a little less made of the same metal, a little more pampered.
[00:11:33.854 --> 00:11:34.774]  Their parents love them.
[00:11:34.814 --> 00:11:35.615]  They take care of them.
[00:11:35.655 --> 00:11:37.555]  They don't stress them.
[00:11:37.995 --> 00:11:40.855]  And then the children of those children get even more pampered.
[00:11:40.895 --> 00:11:45.136]  And then soon, you're dealing with decadent, dumbed-down, mindless sloths.
[00:11:47.237 --> 00:11:49.797]  And I count myself, in many respects, one of them.
[00:11:52.325 --> 00:11:55.966]  But compared to many other people I see, it's terrifying.
[00:11:56.006 --> 00:12:01.847]  There are many, many steps down the ladder into that pit further than I have fallen.
[00:12:01.887 --> 00:12:06.228]  We've got to dig ourselves out of this if we want to be blessed and want to be rewarded.
[00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:08.489]  I'm not going to go into any more preaching.
[00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:20.252]  It's just that I realize how blessed I am, how lucky I am, how just unbelievable my life is, the capacity I've been given, the responsibility I've been given.
[00:12:21.255 --> 00:12:32.382]  To be able to talk to millions of people every day, and to be able to talk to tens of millions on all the other talk show interviews I do, on other radio shows and TV shows, and to have InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:12:33.482 --> 00:12:35.103]  Folks, I make mistakes every day.
[00:12:35.123 --> 00:12:39.086]  I stumble.
[00:12:39.966 --> 00:12:41.267]  I don't have all the answers.
[00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:43.258]  But it doesn't matter.
[00:12:43.298 --> 00:12:45.179]  At least I'm trying the best I can.
[00:12:45.239 --> 00:12:49.062]  At least I'm putting one foot in front of the other and I'm asking God for guidance.
[00:12:49.523 --> 00:12:51.044]  And I'm doing everything I can.
[00:12:51.064 --> 00:12:58.009]  You know, last night I got a call and they wanted me to go on Coast to Coast AM in the first hour and I was honored and blessed to do it.
[00:12:58.029 --> 00:13:00.350]  To be able to talk to all those people.
[00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:03.773]  And I told a story on air.
[00:13:03.833 --> 00:13:06.495]  It's been many years since I've cried.
[00:13:07.509 --> 00:13:08.489]  I don't see that as weakness.
[00:13:08.509 --> 00:13:09.770]  I see that as strength.
[00:13:09.790 --> 00:13:12.250]  And sometimes I see things that are so good and so beautiful that I get a tear in my eye.
[00:13:12.270 --> 00:13:15.011]  But driving home yesterday from a radio show, I began to cry.
[00:13:30.914 --> 00:13:36.881]  I just thought about how they take people's newborn babies in China and kill them and sell their body parts.
[00:13:36.961 --> 00:13:48.695]  I just felt the pain, just a shadow, just an inkling of the pain of those mothers and those fathers and those grandparents living in that vice grip of evil.
[00:13:49.977 --> 00:13:50.838]  And I thought about
[00:13:51.650 --> 00:14:17.123]  I thought about all the little black children predominantly and some white children and Hispanic children taken by CPS all over the country and taken and given to medical institutions and farms where they test everything from pesticides to flame retardant material to drugs on them and they kill them in many cases and it is a normal, it is a real response
[00:14:18.383 --> 00:14:31.447]  If your heart has been blackened, if your conscience, if your soul isn't pink and soft, then it's already begun to harden.
[00:14:31.587 --> 00:14:33.467]  I don't know how people can harden their hearts.
[00:14:33.507 --> 00:14:38.609]  I don't know how people can be so self-centered that they're not involved in fighting this.
[00:14:38.729 --> 00:14:45.031]  I don't know how we can just sit here and watch all of this happen and put up with this.
[00:14:48.209 --> 00:14:53.693]  On the air, I went into how this is real to me, and how somebody's got to speak for these people.
[00:14:54.474 --> 00:14:57.576]  Because just a good old boy, and I could hear it in his voice, he meant well.
[00:14:57.656 --> 00:14:58.857]  He thought he was righteous.
[00:14:59.617 --> 00:15:03.620]  He called in, and he said, Alex, I don't mean to sound mean here, but I really need to know.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.342]  Are you a Democratic Party spokesman?
[00:15:08.844 --> 00:15:10.705]  Are you a paid, some kind of paid operative?
[00:15:13.008 --> 00:15:14.888]  And he didn't sound evil.
[00:15:14.928 --> 00:15:16.269]  He didn't sound frothing.
[00:15:16.369 --> 00:15:19.449]  He really thought I was just making all this up.
[00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:31.212]  He really thought I was making it up that Bush... I knew he got us in debt, but I didn't know what Paul Craig Roberts, the former chief economist at the Treasury Department, talked about last week.
[00:15:33.252 --> 00:15:38.733]  I didn't know that he got us in more debt than all the presidents before, including Bill Clinton.
[00:15:38.833 --> 00:15:41.274]  All of them together, combined in history, in 225 years.
[00:15:44.162 --> 00:15:44.843]  I didn't know that.
[00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:48.746]  But I said, he's that conservative.
[00:15:49.287 --> 00:15:50.688]  I'm against the assault weapons ban.
[00:15:51.689 --> 00:15:52.430]  Bush is for it.
[00:15:52.670 --> 00:15:54.331]  So I'm a liberal, because I guess he's a conservative.
[00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:58.295]  And I got an email today going, that just can't be true.
[00:15:58.815 --> 00:16:02.319]  They're not testing pesticides on kids.
[00:16:05.541 --> 00:16:06.422]  I just can't find it.
[00:16:06.482 --> 00:16:07.383]  I just don't know where it is.
[00:16:07.423 --> 00:16:09.165]  Well, it's right there on the website, right in front of you.
[00:16:09.185 --> 00:16:10.426]  You can go read the rule change.
[00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:20.700]  You know what else you can go read right now at Cornell Law Online or any other major body of law online, any other law school online?
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:21.801]  U.S.
[00:16:21.881 --> 00:16:24.624]  Code, and just don't tell me you can't find it.
[00:16:24.664 --> 00:16:25.585]  Don't just type U.S.
[00:16:25.625 --> 00:16:25.885]  Code in.
[00:16:25.905 --> 00:16:26.466]  Type this in.
[00:16:27.066 --> 00:16:27.427]  U.S.
[00:16:27.507 --> 00:16:27.887]  Code.
[00:16:28.908 --> 00:16:29.289]  U.S.
[00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.809]  Code.
[00:16:30.290 --> 00:16:30.670]  U.S.
[00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:31.551]  and C.O.D.
[00:16:31.651 --> 00:16:32.912]  dot U.S.
[00:16:32.972 --> 00:16:33.773]  Code Title 50.
[00:16:35.373 --> 00:16:54.359]  Chapter 32, subsection 1520A, paragraph B, where the federal government authorizes the covert testing for experimental reasons, any chemical, biological, or radiological system they wish for experimentation or for the public good and some other bumbo-jumbo.
[00:16:56.067 --> 00:17:02.811]  And if you don't know about the Tuskegee with the syphilis and all the atomic soldiers and the radiating the little kids and all of it.
[00:17:03.171 --> 00:17:04.732]  If you don't know about it, fine.
[00:17:05.232 --> 00:17:07.294]  And I get your emails all the time.
[00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:12.056]  None are so blind as those that don't have eyes to see.
[00:17:12.076 --> 00:17:14.898]  And I don't know what you're talking about in this email.
[00:17:16.679 --> 00:17:19.300]  Dear InfoWars, and I'm sure this person's nice too.
[00:17:19.861 --> 00:17:23.243]  Until now, everything I've ever heard Alex say has been backed up by other sources.
[00:17:23.823 --> 00:17:25.104]  I am not certain, however, this
[00:17:26.797 --> 00:17:30.160]  That his explanation of the chemical testing on children is accurate.
[00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:39.448]  It seems from the EPA study that the children will not be exposed to any additional chemicals other than those than what are already being exposed to in their homes.
[00:17:39.508 --> 00:17:40.068]  What does that mean?
[00:17:40.408 --> 00:17:46.253]  The whole thing is about chemical testing and drug testing on foster kids.
[00:17:46.774 --> 00:17:49.076]  It's a huge scandal ongoing for four years.
[00:17:49.636 --> 00:17:51.578]  I mean, it hadn't just been on this radio show.
[00:17:53.024 --> 00:17:55.705]  Alex is saying that children will be exposed to additional chemicals in the study.
[00:17:56.125 --> 00:17:57.945]  The EPA says that's not so, which is true.
[00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:04.227]  There's hundreds of pages of mumbo-jumbo, but then when it gets down to it, there's nothing about the EPA doing a study.
[00:18:05.267 --> 00:18:10.689]  It's saying, well you can go read it, I read the subsections yesterday, here and here.
[00:18:10.729 --> 00:18:11.749]  What are you talking about?
[00:18:12.849 --> 00:18:19.211]  Children who cannot be reasonably consulted, such as those that are mentally handicapped or orphaned, newborns may be tested on.
[00:18:20.569 --> 00:18:26.575]  With permission from the institution or guardian in charge that the individual child may be exposed to chemicals for the sake of research.
[00:18:26.615 --> 00:18:28.316]  I mean, that's out of the subsection.
[00:18:28.837 --> 00:18:32.280]  And it's not just Alex Jones, it's the Organic Consumers Association of America.
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.381]  That's a huge organization.
[00:18:33.581 --> 00:18:35.563]  They just went and read the rule change.
[00:18:35.783 --> 00:18:39.667]  I mean, it's 70 FR 5386526.408.
[00:18:40.367 --> 00:18:43.230]  But you just... I mean, what are you talking about?
[00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:44.091]  You can't find it.
[00:18:44.111 --> 00:18:45.232]  You're not looking very hard.
[00:18:48.513 --> 00:18:49.254]  I've gotten emails.
[00:18:49.314 --> 00:18:52.176]  Where is the story about the Israeli kids getting radiated?
[00:18:54.578 --> 00:18:55.759]  I've gotten a whole bunch of those.
[00:18:55.799 --> 00:18:56.639]  Well, where is it?
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.502]  Well, it's in a bunch of the Jewish newspapers.
[00:18:59.562 --> 00:19:00.563]  I mean, what do you want me to do?
[00:19:00.923 --> 00:19:01.984]  Deliver it to your front door?
[00:19:02.004 --> 00:19:05.066]  And look, I'm not mad at you.
[00:19:05.186 --> 00:19:12.712]  It's just, look, I want you to go check out what we're saying and what we're covering, but we post it there every day.
[00:19:12.772 --> 00:19:13.473]  It's right there.
[00:19:14.093 --> 00:19:17.596]  In fact, in this data page we built about
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:23.983]  This latest rule change proposal, we have right next to it, related.
[00:19:24.283 --> 00:19:28.566]  The ringworm children, how Israel's government irradiated 100,000 Israeli kids.
[00:19:30.847 --> 00:19:31.347]  Here's another one.
[00:19:31.427 --> 00:19:33.969]  Feds, some age drug test violated rules.
[00:19:35.069 --> 00:19:37.411]  Feds tested age drugs on foster kids.
[00:19:37.551 --> 00:19:38.151]  Stuff like that.
[00:19:39.812 --> 00:19:41.453]  And that's bad, that's nothing.
[00:19:41.673 --> 00:19:46.856]  I mean, we've got New York Daily News and other New York papers where they make them drink pesticide and they die, okay?
[00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:49.345]  I mean, it's in, like, major newspapers.
[00:19:51.127 --> 00:19:53.449]  And it tears my guts out.
[00:19:53.749 --> 00:19:57.693]  They're just as bad as the serial killers that kidnap little kids and kill them.
[00:20:03.843 --> 00:20:08.288]  If you think your engine is safe by having the oil changed every 3,000 miles, think again.
[00:20:08.569 --> 00:20:12.173]  Every time you start your car, your engine creates friction between the moving parts.
[00:20:12.293 --> 00:20:20.423]  These moving parts wear against each other, and the result is small metal particles circulating through your oil, causing premature wear and damage to your engine.
[00:20:20.663 --> 00:20:26.325]  Oil filters do a good job of trapping the large metal particles, but they will not trap the most harmful tiny particles.
[00:20:26.606 --> 00:20:31.848]  These tiny particles circulate constantly through your oil, and over time your engine begins to show signs of wear.
[00:20:32.108 --> 00:20:34.209]  This is why you need the filter mag.
[00:20:34.469 --> 00:20:46.614]  The filter mag is a powerful magnet that holds itself to the outside of your oil filter, trapping the tiny metal particles to the inside wall of the filter, extending the life of your oil and ultimately extending the life of your engine.
[00:20:46.854 --> 00:20:51.278]  The reusable FilterMag is maintenance-free, installs in two seconds, and lasts forever.
[00:20:51.499 --> 00:20:52.439]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:54.261]  Go to FilterMag.com.
[00:20:54.381 --> 00:20:56.163]  That's FilterMag.com.
[00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:56.904]  Or call 800-345-8376.
[00:20:56.944 --> 00:20:57.124]  That's 800-345-8376.
[00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:05.501]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:21:05.861 --> 00:21:11.603]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.

[00:21:17.325 --> 00:21:26.609]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:21:26.969 --> 00:21:31.934]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:21:32.234 --> 00:21:36.238]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:21:36.458 --> 00:21:41.222]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:21:41.583 --> 00:21:47.408]  The Murky Lights revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.

[00:21:55.159 --> 00:21:56.360]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:05.743 --> 00:22:06.784]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:07.184 --> 00:22:12.668]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold for your IRA?
[00:22:13.248 --> 00:22:13.748]  That's right.
[00:22:14.069 --> 00:22:16.350]  Gold has been available to be placed in IRAs since 1986.
[00:22:16.670 --> 00:22:23.835]  Yet still, the financial industry refuses to recognize the value of real hard assets for your retirement.
[00:22:24.395 --> 00:22:32.077]  The truth be told, gold and silver has outperformed paper investments like stocks, bonds and CDs, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:22:32.518 --> 00:22:37.379]  Perhaps the financial institutions want to maintain control of your assets by keeping you in paper.
[00:22:37.999 --> 00:22:41.020]  If you'd like to take a look at gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:43.801 --> 00:22:47.944]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low return on your paper investments.

[00:24:01.869 --> 00:24:08.492]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:20.393 --> 00:24:35.237]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:36.178 --> 00:24:36.978]  We're back live.
[00:24:36.998 --> 00:24:41.219]  And yes, coming up today, we had him in studio back on Monday.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:25:02.784]  And they're about to go back to England tomorrow, so we're going to have them back in studio today, and that's going to be Paul Watson and of course his brother Steve Watson that are here in the United States, the respective webmasters of PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.com, and InfoWars.net.
[00:25:05.629 --> 00:25:07.510]  I guess I'm a little emotional today.
[00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:10.791]  I'm good friends with Tex Marx and Wanda Mars.
[00:25:11.011 --> 00:25:13.792]  They're just really sweet, good people.
[00:25:14.853 --> 00:25:20.735]  Did you know their daughter died yesterday after losing a battle with esophageal cancer?
[00:25:21.796 --> 00:25:25.177]  Please don't call them and bug them and bother them, folks.
[00:25:25.697 --> 00:25:32.780]  I know that most people don't even know about it, but I think we should pray for Tex and Wanda because I just couldn't imagine losing a child.
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.201]  That's got to be one of the
[00:25:35.979 --> 00:25:41.263]  Most horrible things there is out there to lose a child.
[00:25:41.283 --> 00:25:48.608]  I mean, it's bad enough to lose a parent or a grandparent, as I talked about at the start of the show, but I didn't go there, but I am going there.
[00:25:49.549 --> 00:25:53.012]  But just imagine, in the order of things, the scheme of things, losing a child.
[00:25:53.072 --> 00:25:53.912]  I don't know what that's like.
[00:25:54.353 --> 00:26:02.599]  And I pray to God, if He grants me any wish, for my pathetic services against the New World Order, that I never have to experience that.
[00:26:07.662 --> 00:26:08.963]  Again, life is flashing.
[00:26:09.003 --> 00:26:09.724]  It is fleeting.
[00:26:09.804 --> 00:26:11.986]  It is a flash in the pan.
[00:26:12.046 --> 00:26:12.486]  It's gone.
[00:26:12.546 --> 00:26:13.187]  Enjoy it.
[00:26:13.827 --> 00:26:14.227]  Love it.
[00:26:14.347 --> 00:26:15.108]  Love others.
[00:26:15.689 --> 00:26:18.211]  People who only care about themselves are totally unhappy.
[00:26:18.571 --> 00:26:21.113]  They think, oh, I've just got to have more, more, more, more, more.
[00:26:21.133 --> 00:26:22.714]  And they only get more and more unhappy.
[00:26:23.455 --> 00:26:27.578]  Yesterday, I just had an incredible, overwhelming feeling of service.
[00:26:27.598 --> 00:26:30.801]  And I don't mean that, again, in some high and mighty
[00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:34.811]  It was a comfort.
[00:26:34.891 --> 00:26:36.112]  I was being comforted.
[00:26:36.793 --> 00:26:40.416]  Yesterday, I was sad about the horrible things the New World Order does.
[00:26:40.496 --> 00:26:42.137]  I was mad that they get away with it.
[00:26:42.677 --> 00:26:43.658]  I was frustrated.
[00:26:43.678 --> 00:26:56.569]  I was really upset driving home, and I was comforted that I'm doing the best I can, that evil is always punished, that there are good people in the world.
[00:26:56.589 --> 00:26:58.631]  There are a lot of good things that are left in the world.
[00:26:59.589 --> 00:27:06.491]  And just that... I don't know what to say.
[00:27:06.591 --> 00:27:11.552]  It's... For those out there, there's just so many good people.
[00:27:11.772 --> 00:27:13.052]  Who really are good people.
[00:27:14.852 --> 00:27:17.053]  And... But they're naive.
[00:27:17.073 --> 00:27:17.953]  They're childlike.
[00:27:18.713 --> 00:27:27.055]  They're like that ten-year-old girl who was walking home from her friend's house, down the street from her house, from a sleepover,
[00:27:28.972 --> 00:27:34.013]  And a sack of maggots, a sack of hell pus, and that's the only way I can describe it.
[00:27:34.514 --> 00:27:41.816]  Somebody, I would like to just torture that person to death, but I wouldn't do that.
[00:27:42.896 --> 00:27:53.839]  I wouldn't do that to Joseph Smith, and that was his name, Joe Smith, who had three daughters himself, and he went and he grabbed her for his own demonic
[00:27:54.571 --> 00:28:02.654]  Satisfaction and he tied her down in horror and raped her and raped her and raped her for days and then he strangled the life out of her.
[00:28:03.594 --> 00:28:08.416]  But because evil is so dangerous, we can't give into it even if it feels like vengeance is ours.
[00:28:08.836 --> 00:28:15.938]  It isn't because if we tortured that maggot, we would lower ourselves in some respect to his level.
[00:28:16.378 --> 00:28:18.219]  No, he should be treated like a dog.
[00:28:19.073 --> 00:28:20.134]  A rabid dog.
[00:28:20.654 --> 00:28:34.604]  He should be given a one appeal and then unceremoniously taken out in a ditch in a firing squad and he should blow his stinking head off.
[00:28:37.045 --> 00:28:42.409]  I mean, I'll be honest with you, the animal in me would just pour molten lead down that guy's throat.
[00:28:42.469 --> 00:28:44.570]  I'd gouge his eyes out myself.
[00:28:44.791 --> 00:28:46.632]  You know, that's what the beast in me wants to do.
[00:28:48.504 --> 00:28:50.045]  But we cannot lower ourselves.
[00:28:50.065 --> 00:28:51.507]  We cannot go down that road.
[00:28:52.568 --> 00:28:55.090]  And, uh, it just makes me sick.
[00:28:56.331 --> 00:28:57.112]  But let me tell you something.
[00:28:57.132 --> 00:29:13.707]  It's just as evil, in fact, in many levels, it's more evil to have this organized system where the foster children are here, they're three-year-olds, and they're going to be part of a little study, and they're wards of the state, and if you're wards of the state, the government can basically give you to corporations for testing.
[00:29:13.727 --> 00:29:14.988]  And this is admitted.
[00:29:16.255 --> 00:29:23.399]  And then they take them, and they give them toxic drugs, and they test their blood, and check their livers, and they get serious health problems, they get sick, they die.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:33.044]  Then there's the cases in our own country, in Israel and other areas, where they just take little five-year-olds in, and strap them in, and send high radiation to their little skulls.
[00:29:35.725 --> 00:29:38.186]  And a large portion die, and the others are brain damaged for life.
[00:29:38.506 --> 00:29:39.867]  I mean, how do you do that?
[00:29:41.128 --> 00:29:41.308]  What?
[00:29:42.208 --> 00:29:45.090]  They are, they are possessed by the devil.
[00:29:46.405 --> 00:29:48.648]  They, they are, they are scum!
[00:29:51.753 --> 00:29:52.674]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.135 --> 00:29:54.757]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.659 --> 00:29:58.363]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.825 --> 00:30:04.427]  Government is death which governs me.
[00:30:04.987 --> 00:30:06.288]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[00:30:06.729 --> 00:30:09.431]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[00:30:09.892 --> 00:30:12.514]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[00:30:12.974 --> 00:30:19.440]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[00:31:21.576 --> 00:31:22.857]  to below detectable levels.

[00:31:34.044 --> 00:31:39.527]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.

[00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:04.548]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[00:32:04.788 --> 00:32:05.129]  Why?
[00:32:05.149 --> 00:32:08.090]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[00:33:10.518 --> 00:33:14.999]  Then, of course, back from 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time.
[00:33:15.299 --> 00:33:16.480]  We're here live, folks.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.221]  Your calls are coming up.
[00:33:19.261 --> 00:33:20.641]  The toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231.
[00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:26.183]  And I'm going to cycle through your calls quickly.
[00:33:26.203 --> 00:33:29.144]  I don't think I've given the number out today, but we have loaded phone lines.
[00:33:30.248 --> 00:33:42.755]  I'm not against doing that, having loaded phone lines from the first five minutes of the show, but a lot of times it tends that people are really off on wild agendas or plug fest, which again doesn't bother me unless it's abused.
[00:33:42.935 --> 00:33:45.016]  So we'll see what's coming up.
[00:33:45.116 --> 00:33:50.339]  I just really want to also make room for the folks that are calling in about issues that we're discussing occasionally.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.321]  So we will cycle through your calls quickly today and come up in a few minutes.
[00:33:53.341 --> 00:33:58.084]  We'll be joined in studio by Steve Watson and Paul Watson, respectively, and that's always informative.
[00:33:59.545 --> 00:34:00.046]  Enjoyable.
[00:34:01.046 --> 00:34:03.308]  And there is just a whole host of news.
[00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:05.529]  Bush's approval ratings fall again, the whole show.
[00:34:06.009 --> 00:34:09.211]  Cheney is vice president for torture, and that's former CIA director.
[00:34:09.231 --> 00:34:20.517]  That's right, a former CIA director and a conservative, Admiral Stansfield Turner, says we're turning into an absolutely disgusting police state and we're all in danger.
[00:34:20.537 --> 00:34:24.940]  Just like Paul Craig Roberts, highest level conservative you can pretty much get, saying the same thing.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:27.001]  It's Nazi Germany, they're total scum.
[00:34:28.054 --> 00:34:30.697]  Because that's just what it is, okay?
[00:34:32.158 --> 00:34:33.839]  There's no putting perfume on a pig.
[00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:38.083]  Lie detectors may be next step in airline security.
[00:34:38.103 --> 00:34:39.364]  This is really dangerous.
[00:34:39.704 --> 00:34:40.465]  A total fraud.
[00:34:40.905 --> 00:34:41.285]  U.S.
[00:34:41.506 --> 00:34:46.330]  House rejects naming building after Senator Harkin and Arlen Speckert.
[00:34:46.370 --> 00:34:48.511]  Now, that's always a tell-tale sign.
[00:34:50.393 --> 00:34:52.715]  Finally, when Rome went into serious decline,
[00:34:54.993 --> 00:34:59.220]  Emperors, Caesars began naming things after themselves while they were alive.
[00:34:59.701 --> 00:35:02.546]  It is not done in free societies.
[00:35:03.127 --> 00:35:06.433]  It is done, I guess, in places where you've got a queen.
[00:35:07.598 --> 00:35:09.959]  It is a sign of massive tyranny.
[00:35:10.279 --> 00:35:13.019]  And right here in Austin, we have another bag of maggots.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:15.240]  Judge Jean Meir.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.221]  I mean, this woman is an abomination.
[00:35:17.281 --> 00:35:18.381]  I could do ten shows on her.
[00:35:19.041 --> 00:35:24.102]  And she's got a huge complex for breaking up families and destroying children's lives.
[00:35:24.162 --> 00:35:25.343]  And it's just a huge cancer.
[00:35:25.683 --> 00:35:27.623]  Her Juvenile Justice Center, and it's named after her.
[00:35:28.624 --> 00:35:30.264]  I mean, this is just a scourge of evil.
[00:35:31.172 --> 00:35:35.855]  And when you see that, folks, I mean, you're talking about, in your face, megalomaniacal tyranny.
[00:35:36.255 --> 00:35:37.536]  It's just another signpost.
[00:35:37.576 --> 00:35:38.336]  It's a benchmark.
[00:35:38.376 --> 00:35:39.617]  It's a signature.
[00:35:39.697 --> 00:35:40.638]  It's a wavelength.
[00:35:40.718 --> 00:35:42.579]  It's an absolute dead ringer.
[00:35:42.919 --> 00:35:44.280]  It's the forensics of tyranny.
[00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:45.641]  Just one more indicator.
[00:35:46.541 --> 00:35:48.723]  100 arrested at Walmart construction site.
[00:35:49.523 --> 00:35:50.684]  There is good news in the world.
[00:35:51.284 --> 00:35:52.085]  Illegal aliens.
[00:35:52.705 --> 00:35:54.846]  Baltimore to buy talking surveillance cameras.
[00:35:54.866 --> 00:35:55.347]  The telescreens.
[00:35:55.367 --> 00:35:56.387]  They already have them in London.
[00:35:56.707 --> 00:35:57.568]  Shout orders at you.
[00:35:57.588 --> 00:35:58.208]  Screaming at you.
[00:35:59.129 --> 00:36:00.770]  Sidney Sheehan found guilty of misdemeanor.
[00:36:01.812 --> 00:36:04.394]  Louie Free charges 9-11 commission cover-up.
[00:36:05.134 --> 00:36:06.615]  This is a total whitewash.
[00:36:07.135 --> 00:36:08.556]  A whitewash within a whitewash.
[00:36:08.676 --> 00:36:14.540]  They'll pose as if they're whistleblowers, bringing you a whitewash, and then you'll swallow the sugar-coated cyanide doublet.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:17.221]  Two charge over Iraq memo leak.
[00:36:17.341 --> 00:36:20.063]  Oh, you leaked memos about how the whole Iraq war stage.
[00:36:20.103 --> 00:36:21.184]  Well, we'll just charge you.
[00:36:23.303 --> 00:36:26.124]  Police admit shoot-to-kill mistakes over in London.
[00:36:26.464 --> 00:36:28.925]  XMI5 boss criticizes useless ID cards.
[00:36:28.945 --> 00:36:31.186]  They're saying it'll increase identity fraud.
[00:36:31.206 --> 00:36:32.247]  Well, that's the plan, Jack.
[00:36:33.007 --> 00:36:35.668]  And shocking pictures released of more Iraq torture.
[00:36:36.809 --> 00:36:40.070]  And the Washington Post is saying, our source is not Dick Cheney for the leak.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.505]  Mary Flu spreads to a quarter of Vietnam's provinces and is spreading in China as well.
[00:36:45.085 --> 00:36:50.271]  So be sure and buy some Tamiflu, even though it'll cause your kid to go psychopathic in many cases and kill themselves.
[00:36:50.952 --> 00:36:53.695]  And believe 9-11 was an inside job, believe the country.
[00:36:53.735 --> 00:36:56.559]  Curt Nemo is reporting on Tucker Carlson and others.
[00:36:56.579 --> 00:36:57.760]  I want to get more into these documents.
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:00.744]  It says oil chiefs met with Cheney Task Force.
[00:37:01.562 --> 00:37:10.845]  Because this is just catching them red-handed in lies and the chemical and pesticide and drug testing on foster children and mentally retarded children, handicapped children.
[00:37:10.885 --> 00:37:13.126]  It's just, what you do to the least, you do to me.
[00:37:13.146 --> 00:37:14.067]  That's what Christ said.
[00:37:14.607 --> 00:37:16.187]  Again, that's what predators do.
[00:37:16.227 --> 00:37:17.488]  They target the weak.
[00:37:18.698 --> 00:37:25.262]  And if you can sit there as the strong, well, they're going to wait until you're in the nursing home, folks, to rip you off and not change your sheets.
[00:37:25.323 --> 00:37:28.625]  And your kids will all be decadent and 45 years old and won't care about you.
[00:37:29.005 --> 00:37:32.287]  They're going to wait until you have that stroke to kill you in the hospital and steal your organs.
[00:37:32.667 --> 00:37:40.893]  They're going to wait, you see, and you're going to be in that position someday, and you could have had 20 years of life ahead of you, but somebody didn't take care of you, so it's over for you.
[00:37:41.193 --> 00:37:42.714]  This stuff all comes back on us.
[00:37:42.814 --> 00:37:48.438]  None of us are safe when the weak and the innocent and the meek are being persecuted.
[00:37:49.295 --> 00:37:54.539]  None of us are safe when a third of the people in prisons and jails, conservatively, are innocent.
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:56.781]  None of us are safe!
[00:37:59.984 --> 00:38:05.408]  Now, coming out, and I will go see it late this evening, I've got a lot of work to do today, and I will...
[00:38:06.624 --> 00:38:10.547]  I'll give you a report back on Monday on Walk the Line, the Johnny Cash story.
[00:38:10.567 --> 00:38:13.449]  We'll see if it's a liberal propaganda piece or if it's accurate.
[00:38:13.469 --> 00:38:14.910]  I know a little bit about Johnny Cash.
[00:38:14.930 --> 00:38:16.090]  I'm a huge fan of Johnny Cash.
[00:38:16.130 --> 00:38:17.191]  I like the music.
[00:38:17.731 --> 00:38:21.114]  But I figured we'd play this, my own personal Jesus.
[00:38:21.174 --> 00:38:22.455]  It's kind of a multi-faceted song.
[00:38:22.775 --> 00:38:26.217]  It's also kind of a jab at the phony preachers, which we're going to be talking about.
[00:38:26.797 --> 00:38:31.360]  Paul Watson and his brother yesterday were watching television, 700 Club, because they're Christians.
[00:38:32.541 --> 00:38:33.161]  Watch it.
[00:38:33.802 --> 00:38:36.443]  Pat Robertson began Satan worshipping live on television.
[00:38:37.223 --> 00:38:40.145]  In between telling us that biometrics and retina scanning are of the Lord.
[00:38:41.125 --> 00:38:42.566]  And Paul has been busy.
[00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:44.266]  He had a lot of problems downloading the clips.
[00:38:44.286 --> 00:38:44.947]  He did find it.
[00:38:45.307 --> 00:38:46.107]  He did download it.
[00:38:46.387 --> 00:38:47.468]  He is writing an article about it.
[00:38:47.488 --> 00:38:48.788]  It will be out this weekend.
[00:38:48.808 --> 00:38:51.510]  It will be out before they jump on the airplane.
[00:38:52.950 --> 00:38:55.011]  And so look for that at InfoWars.com.
[00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:56.732]  But we're going to have video of it, stills of it.
[00:38:57.915 --> 00:39:00.977]  Just actually going, oh Jesus, oh Jesus, I love you Lord.
[00:39:01.358 --> 00:39:03.219]  Doing the devil sign while he does it.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:08.122]  Which in black magic, you actually get more power off that.
[00:39:08.162 --> 00:39:12.185]  So you desecrate the name of Christ while you do it, combining the Satanism with it.
[00:39:12.425 --> 00:39:14.186]  That's actually highest level black magic.
[00:39:15.524 --> 00:39:17.648]  And please don't call me saying Pat Robertson's good.
[00:39:17.668 --> 00:39:21.173]  He said China's doing what it has to do with forced abortion and infanticide.
[00:39:21.494 --> 00:39:24.719]  And people actually called him five years ago, four years ago, defending him when he did that.
[00:39:24.759 --> 00:39:26.401]  They went, well still, don't talk bad about him.
[00:39:26.942 --> 00:39:27.543]  I've seen him.
[00:39:27.603 --> 00:39:30.508]  In fact, I have a tape somewhere around here where he says implantable microchips.
[00:39:31.681 --> 00:39:33.002]  Are not a problem.
[00:39:33.522 --> 00:39:35.742]  And now we have him saying biometrics are a problem.
[00:39:35.762 --> 00:39:37.003]  So that will all be on the show Monday.
[00:39:37.323 --> 00:39:41.524]  The audio of that, but coming up by the night or tomorrow, we'll have all the video clips of it and a big article about it.
[00:39:41.944 --> 00:39:43.364]  Paul's been working on it since yesterday.
[00:39:43.744 --> 00:39:47.565]  All day yesterday, fighting with the video.
[00:39:48.366 --> 00:39:52.687]  With his 1845 model laptop.
[00:39:53.127 --> 00:39:53.807]  I'm joking.
[00:39:54.167 --> 00:39:57.488]  Hey, let's go ahead and go to just a little bit of... I'm going to play the whole song.
[00:39:59.632 --> 00:40:04.756]  This is the last record, last CD, last bundle of songs that Johnny Cash put out.
[00:40:04.776 --> 00:40:05.917]  It just appears before he died.
[00:40:05.937 --> 00:40:07.138]  I think right after his wife had died.
[00:40:07.158 --> 00:40:12.323]  They're all Christian songs on the CD.
[00:40:12.983 --> 00:40:13.984]  Go ahead and roll that.
[00:40:29.792 --> 00:40:34.754]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:40:37.995 --> 00:40:40.316]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:40:40.856 --> 00:40:42.217]  Someone who cares.
[00:40:42.237 --> 00:40:45.618]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:40:53.562 --> 00:40:55.983]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:40:56.443 --> 00:41:04.846]  Someone who's there.
[00:41:09.107 --> 00:41:12.148]  Feeling unknown and you're all alone.
[00:41:12.929 --> 00:41:16.530]  Flesh and bones by the telephone.
[00:41:16.890 --> 00:41:20.351]  Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer.
[00:41:24.711 --> 00:41:27.813]  Take second best, put me to the test.
[00:41:28.614 --> 00:41:31.596]  Things on your chest, you need to confess.
[00:41:32.656 --> 00:41:37.980]  I will deliver, you know I'm a forgiver.
[00:41:39.741 --> 00:41:44.084]  Reach out and touch face.
[00:41:50.058 --> 00:41:51.839]  Reach out and touch faith.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:42:00.383]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:42:03.644 --> 00:42:05.965]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:42:06.505 --> 00:42:08.506]  Someone who cares.
[00:42:10.967 --> 00:42:15.829]  Your own personal Jesus.
[00:42:19.159 --> 00:42:21.480]  Someone to hear your prayers.
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:23.620]  Someone to care.
[00:42:34.743 --> 00:42:38.204]  Feeling unknown and you're all alone.
[00:42:38.544 --> 00:42:41.664]  Flesh and bone by the telephone.
[00:42:42.485 --> 00:42:45.985]  Lift up the receiver, I'll make you a believer.
[00:42:50.468 --> 00:42:51.589]  I will deliver.
[00:42:52.089 --> 00:42:55.791]  You know I'm a forgiver.
[00:42:57.532 --> 00:43:03.055]  Reach out and touch faith.
[00:43:03.335 --> 00:43:09.818]  Reach out and touch faith.
[00:43:09.838 --> 00:43:11.399]  Alright, that's Johnny Cash, folks.
[00:43:11.899 --> 00:43:12.800]  Personal Jesus.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.942]  I guess it's a redo of a cover for that Depeche Mode song.
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.921]  We are joined in studio by Steve Watson and Paul Watson.
[00:43:21.361 --> 00:43:24.943]  Guys, you've been in the United States now for about seven days.
[00:43:24.983 --> 00:43:25.603]  How have you liked it?
[00:43:25.623 --> 00:43:28.024]  It's been pretty good so far.
[00:43:28.844 --> 00:43:34.627]  Obviously it's all Western culture, so it's pretty similar, but certainly everything's bigger in Texas.
[00:43:35.287 --> 00:43:36.807]  Definitely the portions are bigger.
[00:43:37.808 --> 00:43:39.408]  And it's been an education.
[00:43:39.448 --> 00:43:46.111]  It's been quite good to actually get over here after talking to Alex for years and years to actually be in Austin, Texas.
[00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:50.153]  And be in the epicenter of the battle against the New World Order.
[00:43:51.314 --> 00:43:52.696]  And to get bigger portions.
[00:43:53.396 --> 00:43:55.538]  Yeah, bigger portions of squid.
[00:43:56.559 --> 00:43:57.100]  That's right.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:01.604]  We actually went and you guys had some squid at an Italian food restaurant a few nights ago.
[00:44:01.724 --> 00:44:02.745]  Some calamari.
[00:44:02.765 --> 00:44:03.626]  It was pretty good, wasn't it?
[00:44:04.545 --> 00:44:07.827]  Yeah, first time I've ever had it, so it was a new experience.
[00:44:08.227 --> 00:44:11.129]  So we've been squidding around, squidding around town, eating squid.
[00:44:11.149 --> 00:44:12.149]  They're like, squid?
[00:44:12.169 --> 00:44:16.091]  These little squids, but it tastes like fried chicken.
[00:44:16.111 --> 00:44:18.092]  You're right, it's like Kentucky Fried Chicken.
[00:44:19.073 --> 00:44:19.994]  And it certainly does.
[00:44:20.034 --> 00:44:21.314]  That's vital information.
[00:44:21.374 --> 00:44:22.355]  You tuned in, folks.
[00:44:22.895 --> 00:44:26.057]  You tuned in to hear about Kentucky Fried Chicken Squid.
[00:44:27.378 --> 00:44:31.520]  Seriously, we've got all this news to go over, but you guys are watching television.
[00:44:32.655 --> 00:44:51.089]  We've written articles about Berlusconi, the president over in Italy, Putin, the king from Jordan, Ronald Reagan, George Bush Senior, Dan Quayle, I mean everybody doing the Diablo.
[00:44:51.770 --> 00:45:00.236]  I don't mean, you know, the I love you, doing the Diablo over and over again, and then Jax Mars wrote a book that's just full of preachers constantly doing it.
[00:45:00.854 --> 00:45:06.918]  And they will say, oh Jesus, and then do the sign of the devil.
[00:45:07.578 --> 00:45:16.744]  And so I got over to the hotel room you guys were in last night, and I walk in there and you've got your laptop on, Codex Magica open, and you're like, look at this!
[00:45:17.104 --> 00:45:19.986]  You've finally been able to find it and download it.
[00:45:20.746 --> 00:45:23.428]  Well, he was doing a bunch of stuff in his TV show on 700 Club.
[00:45:23.648 --> 00:45:29.612]  A lot of you may have seen it yesterday, how Big Brother's here to stay, oh, threat of scanning at the public schools isn't a big deal.
[00:45:30.467 --> 00:45:31.688]  But then he did something else.
[00:45:31.908 --> 00:45:32.909]  So guys, go over that.
[00:45:32.969 --> 00:45:35.011]  Talk about what you witnessed.
[00:45:35.251 --> 00:45:42.076]  We were eating breakfast, watching the 700 Club, expecting to see rampant hypocrisy as usual.
[00:45:43.717 --> 00:45:49.802]  And first they had on some plastic surgeon, so it was very Christian now to have plastic surgery.
[00:45:49.842 --> 00:45:51.363]  For some reason they were promoting that.
[00:45:52.444 --> 00:45:56.387]  And then later, Robertson went off on a rant against body piercing.
[00:45:56.487 --> 00:45:58.028]  So again, contradicting himself.
[00:45:59.342 --> 00:46:01.663]  They were talking about physical ailments.
[00:46:01.683 --> 00:46:10.105]  He kept doing the hand over the heart gesture which according to Tex Marser's book again in some circles is a sign of the occult.
[00:46:11.105 --> 00:46:19.428]  Then he started talking about an ailment of abdominal pain or something like that and he closed his eyes and he started talking about the burning.
[00:46:19.448 --> 00:46:21.768]  You can feel the fire, you can feel the fire.
[00:46:22.449 --> 00:46:23.969]  And then about a minute later
[00:46:25.374 --> 00:46:29.798]  Um, he's talking about something else, and he clearly flashes El Diablo.
[00:46:30.458 --> 00:46:33.761]  I didn't see it at first on the television, but my brother saw it.
[00:46:34.502 --> 00:46:36.343]  Um, so he said that he'd done that.
[00:46:36.383 --> 00:46:37.904]  We continued watching the show.
[00:46:38.805 --> 00:46:45.150]  And then they had this question raised about, um, child, uh, child finger scanning to get into a school.
[00:46:46.171 --> 00:46:51.535]  And, um, Robertson's response to it was basically to whitewash it and say, Big Brother's in control.
[00:46:52.016 --> 00:46:53.537]  There's nothing you can do about it.
[00:46:53.557 --> 00:46:54.338]  And he's helping, and...
[00:46:55.129 --> 00:46:59.914]  Yeah, and he said, uh, we'll all soon be subject to eye scans to enter buildings and so forth.
[00:47:00.194 --> 00:47:01.035]  Just accept him.
[00:47:01.776 --> 00:47:15.110]  Yeah, so, I thought, there's an article in itself, um, we went on the 700 Club's website, found the live stream, um, I downloaded some special software, it took all day to download the video because it was half a gig.
[00:47:16.114 --> 00:47:25.860]  Um, and we did capture the El Diablo sign when he did it, um, and the answer to the question about biometrics, so we've got an article coming up in the next couple of days.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.742]  And Steve, this isn't just passing, I mean, what did you think when you saw it?
[00:47:28.782 --> 00:47:36.527]  You've, uh, I mean, we've now seen the video, we have video, it's going up in the next day or so, but, but I mean, tell the folks what, I mean, it was totally obvious.
[00:47:37.347 --> 00:47:45.212]  Yeah, well, I mean, it's, it's, it's often very easy for paparazzi photographers or whoever to capture celebrities
[00:47:46.295 --> 00:47:50.799]  Um, waving, and it kind of looks like the El Diablo sign, but this was clear.
[00:47:50.859 --> 00:47:55.842]  It was... He basically held up his hand, and as he was talking... He was saying the name Jesus.
[00:47:56.062 --> 00:48:00.506]  He was saying Jesus, Jesus, and he basically transformed it into the El Diablo sign.
[00:48:00.546 --> 00:48:03.007]  It's... It's not an easy thing to do, either.
[00:48:03.027 --> 00:48:05.569]  You have to really think about what you're doing with your hand.
[00:48:05.589 --> 00:48:07.631]  No, he touched thumb to the two middle fingers.
[00:48:07.651 --> 00:48:09.772]  I mean, he, he, he... Yeah, it was a full sign, yeah.
[00:48:09.873 --> 00:48:10.933]  Well, he likes you, too!
[00:48:11.033 --> 00:48:14.476]  I mean... Oh, but you said yesterday, Alex, that...
[00:48:15.333 --> 00:48:21.955]  You think they're doing this, in some cases, to draw down power because they're, you know, behind in their agenda so much?
[00:48:22.035 --> 00:48:23.255]  No, they really believe in this stuff.
[00:48:23.295 --> 00:48:25.596]  No, that's why everywhere you go is the pyramid, the eye.
[00:48:26.096 --> 00:48:27.156]  That's what magic is.
[00:48:27.256 --> 00:48:32.878]  And then doing it out in the open, and I mean, folks, I actually have the big official Black Magic books written 500 years ago.
[00:48:32.898 --> 00:48:35.018]  I mean, I've studied it to make these films.
[00:48:35.038 --> 00:48:38.159]  I've gone to Tex Marr's big library to also study it.
[00:48:38.963 --> 00:48:39.903]  That's what you do.
[00:48:40.364 --> 00:48:42.844]  In real black magic, you use the name of Jesus.
[00:48:42.864 --> 00:48:46.966]  I mean, he is actually engaging in black magic on television.
[00:48:47.346 --> 00:48:50.487]  You start going, Jesus, Jesus, and he's shaking.
[00:48:50.567 --> 00:48:52.128]  Jesus, Jesus, oh, heal him.
[00:48:52.428 --> 00:48:59.130]  And in El Diablo, I mean, that is black magic grade A. People don't understand that.
[00:49:00.051 --> 00:49:02.492]  The name of Christ is central in black magic.
[00:49:02.532 --> 00:49:06.193]  You order the demons to do what you want in the name of Christ.
[00:49:07.293 --> 00:49:15.199]  And when he actually did it, in the context of drawing power from it, he thrusted it forward as if he was tapping into some kind of power.
[00:49:15.279 --> 00:49:20.122]  No, it's just like in the new film, The Order of Death, when they do that spell and they energize and fire it.
[00:49:21.483 --> 00:49:25.907]  It's like the witch going... I mean, that's what they're doing.
[00:49:26.787 --> 00:49:35.113]  Yeah, it all sounds very bizarre, but I mean, the thing is, he's sat there with his co-host, eyes closed, and he's setting himself up.
[00:49:36.724 --> 00:49:43.465]  Suggests that he's getting these messages of these people that have ailments and that he is actually healing them on air.
[00:49:44.145 --> 00:49:49.706]  So although it sounds bizarre what we're saying, it's equally as bizarre what he's actually playing out on TV.
[00:49:50.446 --> 00:49:58.268]  Like he's Jesus, he can psychically entwine who needs healing and it's coming into him and it's direct from God.
[00:49:58.908 --> 00:49:59.928]  So that was pretty odd.
[00:50:00.668 --> 00:50:04.709]  At the end of the biometric justification and advocacy,
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:12.806]  He said, well at least we don't have to give DNA or blood samples yet, which is actually happening if you read the news.
[00:50:12.826 --> 00:50:14.327]  I think he said that might be a problem.
[00:50:14.387 --> 00:50:22.835]  I see now we're even, and look, I saw him like three years ago on TV, we have the clip, we played it on the local show, and he says, oh microchips, that's not a problem, yeah.
[00:50:22.855 --> 00:50:25.437]  Yeah, let's go ahead and get our, I mean, yeah.
[00:50:25.637 --> 00:50:27.899]  And people are like, hey, Pat Robertson didn't say that.
[00:50:28.279 --> 00:50:29.320]  He's a lord.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:33.944]  Well remember when he came out and said forced infanticide and abortion is okay in China?
[00:50:35.173 --> 00:50:39.154]  And then his clarification on the CBN website was, well, they are overpopulated.
[00:50:39.514 --> 00:50:40.915]  I'm sorry, what were you going to say, Paul?
[00:50:42.115 --> 00:50:46.676]  Yeah, just the DNA legislation is in the new Patriot Act, so that's all coming along anyway.
[00:50:46.716 --> 00:50:48.897]  DNA, upon being arrested, it will be taken.
[00:50:49.977 --> 00:50:56.138]  And by the way, not just arrested, it's going to be when you get pulled over and are given a ticket for speeding, it's automatically done.
[00:50:56.538 --> 00:50:58.639]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[00:51:01.460 --> 00:51:03.000]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:06.241]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.381 --> 00:51:10.282]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.322 --> 00:51:14.543]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.903 --> 00:51:18.664]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.804 --> 00:51:20.705]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:20.805 --> 00:51:24.126]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[00:51:24.166 --> 00:51:25.246]  The medical bills!
[00:51:26.927 --> 00:51:28.868]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:29.028 --> 00:51:32.070]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.250 --> 00:51:35.112]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:41.717]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.237 --> 00:51:46.038]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:51:46.438 --> 00:51:47.799]  Order your video today.
[00:51:48.139 --> 00:51:49.199]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.219 --> 00:51:51.240]  The number to order to take over again is 888-253-3139.

[00:52:00.863 --> 00:52:07.107]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:52:07.227 --> 00:52:13.391]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:52:13.671 --> 00:52:22.116]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:52:22.356 --> 00:52:29.380]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:52:29.680 --> 00:52:34.503]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:52:34.723 --> 00:52:40.127]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:52:40.467 --> 00:52:43.549]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:51.875]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:51.895 --> 00:52:52.475]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.823 --> 00:53:02.204]  Thank you.
[00:53:17.404 --> 00:53:18.065]  We're good to go!
[00:53:37.662 --> 00:53:38.262]  We're good to go.
[00:54:08.641 --> 00:54:12.503]  Maureen, and Ron, and Ginger, and Gilligan.
[00:54:13.743 --> 00:54:19.205]  We will take all of your calls immediately upon starting the next hour.
[00:54:22.347 --> 00:54:24.508]  But last night in the car, we all went to dinner.
[00:54:25.208 --> 00:54:29.810]  Paul, Steve, my wife and I, Ryan Slickhizen and his girlfriend.
[00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:33.532]  We all went to dinner at Dave and Buster's.
[00:54:34.892 --> 00:54:36.933]  But driving in the car, we were just talking about it.
[00:54:38.737 --> 00:54:40.298]  We're saying to ourselves, why?
[00:54:40.418 --> 00:54:42.639]  Why are we watching Christian leaders do this?
[00:54:43.599 --> 00:54:46.400]  Clearly drawing down power, clearly doing El Diablo.
[00:54:48.981 --> 00:54:50.622]  Why are all these corporate symbols like this?
[00:54:50.662 --> 00:54:53.943]  I mean, we know they're devil worshippers, but it just is so weird!
[00:54:53.963 --> 00:54:56.504]  But Hollywood throws it in our face.
[00:54:56.524 --> 00:55:01.726]  Remember the comedy with Aykroyd and Hanks, Dragnet?
[00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:04.932]  Just the facts, man!
[00:55:05.292 --> 00:55:09.153]  And then, really, the leader of the pagans is the big Christian leader.
[00:55:09.173 --> 00:55:13.894]  Remember when they all dance around and the cops catch them?
[00:55:14.354 --> 00:55:17.615]  I mean, that's Hollywood just flaunting it, just throwing it in our face.
[00:55:18.176 --> 00:55:21.076]  This is what they're into, but it's kept very quiet.
[00:55:23.017 --> 00:55:27.898]  Just comments on why they do this, why they believe in this, why they're just raving lunatics, I guess.
[00:55:29.679 --> 00:55:30.059]  Well, I mean,
[00:55:31.064 --> 00:55:35.126]  Tate Robertson is basically the voice of Christian America for a lot of people.
[00:55:35.707 --> 00:55:48.634]  If he's coming out with a stance, even if you bypass the El Diablo, even if you think that was accidental, which it blatantly wasn't, some people do take it too far and say that everybody's doing it, but that was deliberate, but bypassing that,
[00:55:49.306 --> 00:55:51.127]  Just the advocacy of Big Brother.
[00:55:52.027 --> 00:55:59.270]  Mainstream Christians in America will take that as the kind of platform of Christianity in the new millennium.
[00:55:59.390 --> 00:56:02.811]  Oh yeah, microchips and face scanners and cameras, that's the Lord!
[00:56:02.831 --> 00:56:04.572]  It directly contradicts the Bible.
[00:56:05.352 --> 00:56:14.735]  But also, the question that Robertson was addressing was regarding finger scanning into schools, which is totally bizarre in itself.
[00:56:15.416 --> 00:56:18.577]  Why should children have to finger scan just to get into school?
[00:56:19.671 --> 00:56:21.571]  It's just bizarre.
[00:56:22.512 --> 00:56:23.372]  No, it really is.
[00:56:23.392 --> 00:56:26.113]  I mean, prisoners did it a few years ago.
[00:56:26.173 --> 00:56:27.353]  Now it's in the grocery stores.
[00:56:27.413 --> 00:56:27.933]  It's everywhere.
[00:56:27.953 --> 00:56:29.833]  They're training them to accept this.
[00:56:29.853 --> 00:56:32.534]  I've been talking about this forever, pulling my hair out.
[00:56:33.274 --> 00:56:37.755]  And I remember Pat Robertson just six, seven years ago saying biometrics were bad.
[00:56:38.316 --> 00:56:39.796]  Or, well, we better watch these.
[00:56:39.856 --> 00:56:42.997]  I don't know about these, but now he's, look, it's good, all right?
[00:56:44.497 --> 00:56:48.258]  And by the way, I mean, it's just, it's just in your face.
[00:56:49.409 --> 00:56:59.739]  And then, on the subject of the schools, um, it's not a training ground for a police state, it is a police state, it is a jail when you've got surveillance cameras everywhere.
[00:56:59.959 --> 00:57:02.161]  You've got armed guards everywhere now in schools.
[00:57:02.201 --> 00:57:07.186]  It's just like the prisons, where every day they go, alright, lock down, open your jails up, we're gonna search your stuff.
[00:57:07.226 --> 00:57:12.491]  I got articles every day where they just come in with dogs and line the kids up and search them and yell at them.
[00:57:12.551 --> 00:57:13.332]  I mean, that's prison.
[00:57:13.812 --> 00:57:17.936]  And then they stifle the natural growth of the child with Ritalin and all these other street drugs.
[00:57:18.417 --> 00:57:26.665]  You know, ban TAG, ban Daisy Chains, and it just stifles the natural upbringing and education which would go along with any normal childhood.
[00:57:26.705 --> 00:57:33.793]  And then they replace it with all this authoritarian police state stuff, so... Well, we gotta ban Dodgeball and TAG.
[00:57:33.833 --> 00:57:34.593]  They're evil, but...
[00:57:35.726 --> 00:57:41.489]  And they have special SWAT team raids on kids with regulation gloves out in the field boxing.
[00:57:41.649 --> 00:57:42.489]  Oh, it's evil!
[00:57:42.509 --> 00:57:45.251]  I mean, that was everywhere just twenty, thirty years ago.
[00:57:45.591 --> 00:57:47.132]  A hundred years ago, that's all you saw.
[00:57:47.532 --> 00:57:50.213]  Every little farm had a boxing rink out in the barn.
[00:57:50.513 --> 00:57:52.894]  I mean, we're becoming mutated scum monsters.
[00:57:54.295 --> 00:57:55.616]  Well, yeah, they're doing it through culture.
[00:57:55.636 --> 00:57:56.316]  They're doing it through
[00:57:57.619 --> 00:58:06.583]  Reading newspapers, but mainly, you know, through creating norms and stereotypes of trendiness, which is what a lot of people buy into.
[00:58:06.743 --> 00:58:09.604]  Trendiness is hating guns, hating family, hating freedom.
[00:58:10.564 --> 00:58:15.166]  So, they're buying into a lifestyle, they get kickbacks of their ego, it's peer pressure.
[00:58:15.546 --> 00:58:19.507]  So that's the main frontier of the attack, and that's the one that we've got to focus on even more.
[00:58:20.648 --> 00:58:24.669]  Well, maybe now, if you don't flash the sign of the devil, you're not really Christian.
[00:58:24.709 --> 00:58:26.350]  Maybe that's actually a Christian symbol.
[00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:27.340]  Could be.
[00:58:28.381 --> 00:58:29.241]  Maybe we're bad.
[00:58:29.542 --> 00:58:30.482]  I'm sure I'm going to get emails.
[00:58:30.922 --> 00:58:32.383]  This is our last straw.
[00:58:32.764 --> 00:58:34.905]  He is a man of gold.
[00:58:35.105 --> 00:58:35.765]  That's how they say it.
[00:58:35.785 --> 00:58:40.108]  Alright, we'll be right back with the second hour of your calls and a ton of news.
[00:58:41.669 --> 00:58:45.912]  Order a copy of this show for your friends and family at GCNlive.com or call 877-300-7645.
[00:58:57.458 --> 00:58:58.098]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.759 --> 00:58:59.819]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.539 --> 00:59:01.620]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.100]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.861 --> 00:59:04.721]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.401 --> 00:59:09.042]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.603 --> 00:59:13.724]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.805 --> 00:59:22.328]  We've had so many requests to re-air it that coming up to the third hour, we're going to play the Paul Craig Roberts interview from last Friday.
[00:59:22.388 --> 00:59:23.208]  Very, very important.
[00:59:23.228 --> 00:59:25.829]  We talk about America becoming Nazi Germany.
[00:59:26.724 --> 00:59:36.373]  The design destruction of the economy, it's all coming up, but we've got an hour more live with you on this Friday edition in the studio of Paul Watson and Steve Watson.
[00:59:36.913 --> 00:59:45.361]  I want to talk a little bit about what happened in London while we were there and just the Big Brother police state and the population and how they responded.
[00:59:46.142 --> 00:59:47.223]  I want to do that
[00:59:48.210 --> 00:59:49.392]  We're good to go.
[01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:08.391]  But, so we're going to do some of that coming up after we cover some news and take calls.
[01:00:08.691 --> 01:00:12.692]  But right now, and I'm going to move your calls quickly, folks, and then on to the next person.
[01:00:13.173 --> 01:00:13.993]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:00:14.033 --> 01:00:14.713]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:15.593 --> 01:00:17.874]  Let's talk to Jason in Maryland.
[01:00:17.914 --> 01:00:18.774]  Jason, you're on the air.
[01:00:18.794 --> 01:00:19.334]  Thanks for holding.
[01:00:19.655 --> 01:00:31.899]  Yeah, Alex, I talked with you a couple of months ago, I guess it was, a month and a half, something like that, and I told you that George Norrie had a friend who said there were bomb
[01:00:34.034 --> 01:00:37.777]  Uh, are blast marks found on the, uh, dykes there?
[01:00:37.878 --> 01:00:39.019]  Yeah, and I talked to George.
[01:00:39.079 --> 01:00:39.699]  He said no.
[01:00:39.739 --> 01:00:41.140]  They had callers that said that.
[01:00:41.761 --> 01:00:42.281]  Oh, okay.
[01:00:42.361 --> 01:00:45.724]  Well, that's all I was calling to find out if you knew anything more about it.
[01:00:46.045 --> 01:00:48.647]  Yeah, I did talk to George Norrie about that right after you told me that.
[01:00:48.867 --> 01:00:50.168]  I asked his producer first.
[01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:51.189]  I said, is that true?
[01:00:51.229 --> 01:00:52.550]  And I talked to George and that wasn't.
[01:00:53.051 --> 01:00:53.972]  That was being discussed.
[01:00:53.992 --> 01:00:56.854]  They were covering news articles that were purporting that.
[01:00:57.555 --> 01:00:57.835]  I see.
[01:00:58.695 --> 01:00:59.395]  Okay, well thanks.
[01:00:59.635 --> 01:01:00.475]  Thank you for the call.
[01:01:00.956 --> 01:01:08.677]  I know this, the FEMA deliberately sabotaged things, they jammed the police communications day one, blocked the aid getting in, to make it as bad as they could.
[01:01:08.697 --> 01:01:10.678]  So they could then come save us.
[01:01:11.518 --> 01:01:18.740]  Let's talk to Ben, and he's calling us from Mississippi, speaking of the hurricane and the aftermath.
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:19.620]  Go ahead, Ben.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:24.261]  Hello Alex, Paul, Steve, welcome to the states from the state of hospitality.
[01:01:24.781 --> 01:01:25.202]  Thank you.
[01:01:25.402 --> 01:01:25.962]  Thank you, sir.
[01:01:27.432 --> 01:01:39.627]  Alex, I was listening to a popular syndicated talk show a while ago and the host was alluding to a story about a man who had HIV and then 14 months later mysteriously it was gone.
[01:01:40.912 --> 01:01:43.375]  What do you think happened with Magic Johnson?
[01:01:44.136 --> 01:01:51.464]  Actually, the virus doesn't really cause AIDS, and that's a whole other show, and I mentioned this back on Tuesday when it first broke.
[01:01:52.045 --> 01:01:58.512]  It's been well known, but yeah, it's finally in the BBC and the Independent and the Telegraph, it's finally in British newspapers and French newspapers.
[01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:06.052]  That you can actually recharge your immune system and get it back in most cases.
[01:02:08.553 --> 01:02:28.019]  What they do is they find people who already just so happen to have this virus in them that is a mild virus overall and most people that are actually dying of AIDS either already have bad immune systems or already were hemophiliacs and had problems and then they get complicating other diseases or cancers or hepatitis
[01:02:28.719 --> 01:02:31.601]  I don't want to go into any details here, but it's not a very pretty picture.
[01:02:44.373 --> 01:02:57.780]  And snorting methamphetamine, using street drugs that are dirty, full of all sorts of heavy metals and toxins, and then that just kills the life force in your blood.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:00.341]  It kills the T lymphocytes, and that is what kills you.
[01:03:00.701 --> 01:03:04.243]  And I had doctors tell me this when I was like 15 years old.
[01:03:04.563 --> 01:03:07.364]  I read this in medical journals when I was like 16 years old.
[01:03:08.105 --> 01:03:09.445]  I mean, this is not a big secret.
[01:03:10.246 --> 01:03:12.587]  The thing that was weird about it, though, was he was alluding to
[01:03:13.563 --> 01:03:23.930]  Whether or not the government has a right, now right, to nab his DNA to see whether or not he has a genetic quote-unquote cure for the virus.
[01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:27.132]  Well stay there, I want to hear, well of course they got some weird police state angle.
[01:03:28.573 --> 01:03:40.400]  Actually there was a federal court appeal a few years ago where they ruled that when you give blood at the hospital or blood to a company or blood test they're allowed to sell that and anything they find in your blood you don't have intellectual property rights to it.
[01:03:41.292 --> 01:03:42.293]  Something we should all be aware of.
[01:03:42.313 --> 01:03:45.998]  Of course you own your blood and any value that's in it, but not according to them.
[01:03:46.559 --> 01:03:48.461]  You get a blood sample for something else you don't even know.
[01:03:48.501 --> 01:03:50.424]  They're busy selling that.
[01:03:50.524 --> 01:03:51.025]  So stay there.
[01:03:51.045 --> 01:03:52.166]  We'll come back and talk more about it, Ben.
[01:03:54.261 --> 01:03:57.122]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:03:57.362 --> 01:03:58.963]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[01:03:59.283 --> 01:04:03.965]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:04:04.305 --> 01:04:08.747]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[01:04:09.167 --> 01:04:13.369]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:04:13.569 --> 01:04:14.189]  The Constitution
[01:04:14.229 --> 01:04:14.809]  We're good to go.
[01:04:38.668 --> 01:04:43.955]  1-888-253-3139 or visit InfoWars.com and the secure shopping cart.
[01:04:44.035 --> 01:04:50.945]  That's InfoWars.com or 888-253-3139 or watch the film right now online at PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:04:54.938 --> 01:04:55.999]  The War on Terrorism.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:04:59.103]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.364 --> 01:05:03.529]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.949 --> 01:05:04.791]  So what do you do?

[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.942]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[01:06:01.382 --> 01:06:04.044]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[01:06:04.484 --> 01:06:10.947]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[01:06:57.703 --> 01:06:58.403]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.004 --> 01:07:00.104]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.785 --> 01:07:01.926]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:01.946 --> 01:07:03.387]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.107 --> 01:07:04.968]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:09.331]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.871 --> 01:07:13.914]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:18.517 --> 01:07:23.961]  In many cases, the drugs they give you to treat HIV are actually what kills you.
[01:07:25.923 --> 01:07:28.605]  Remember Magic Johnson, he had AIDS, HIV?
[01:07:29.565 --> 01:07:35.269]  Hadn't developed football and AIDS yet, and then, oh, he just, decades later, oh, I'm fine, I'm great, I don't have it anymore.
[01:07:36.110 --> 01:07:39.392]  But see, he still goes out and pushes, be sure and take your AIDS medication.
[01:07:39.953 --> 01:07:41.774]  Ooh, he's a big poster boy for that.
[01:07:42.839 --> 01:07:45.061]  And it just goes on and on and on.
[01:07:45.661 --> 01:07:53.126]  Frankly, what kills you is you snort enough drugs or shoot enough drugs, cut with heavy metals and poisons, you're going to shut down.
[01:07:53.146 --> 01:07:55.387]  You're going to die.
[01:07:55.407 --> 01:08:04.253]  Or other viruses that wouldn't affect you will be able to affect you, and cancer viruses that were already in you from vaccines or from
[01:08:05.612 --> 01:08:14.598]  The foreign RNA that was placed into your bloodstream because you had thousands of sexual partners is going to overwhelm and short-circuit you.
[01:08:15.118 --> 01:08:16.599]  And then you're going to die.
[01:08:17.780 --> 01:08:18.921]  That's what does it.
[01:08:19.661 --> 01:08:24.824]  Now they've caught them in Africa, people who have never been sexually active, whose parents don't have AIDS or HIV.
[01:08:25.725 --> 01:08:27.026]  Let me tell you, the virus that causes AIDS.
[01:08:28.406 --> 01:08:32.168]  And this has been in the BBC, remember a few years ago, and they said, well then why do all these kids have it?
[01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:43.173]  And all they could link it to was the shots, and then some people broke in, and some scientists in India and Africa looked at it, and lo and behold, there was magically HIV virus in the needles.
[01:08:44.484 --> 01:08:48.286]  And then it was in the news, well they must have been there because they were sharing the needles.
[01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:53.469]  The UN was giving kids a shot, 100 kids a shot with the same needle.
[01:08:53.969 --> 01:09:00.033]  And then I got a call, people say, well Alex, I thought you just said that the HIV virus doesn't cause AIDS.
[01:09:01.641 --> 01:09:08.044]  Well, they've found other little, little pathogens and goodies in the shots they're giving them.
[01:09:08.104 --> 01:09:09.785]  I mean, this is all over the foreign press.
[01:09:10.105 --> 01:09:15.268]  They've caught them adding different hormones to tetanus shots than sterilized women.
[01:09:15.308 --> 01:09:18.290]  They've caught them with deadly cancer viruses being added.
[01:09:18.310 --> 01:09:28.515]  Just a few weeks ago, there was some new cancer virus that spread all over England, and it's killing thousands and thousands of people a year that was in some vaccines.
[01:09:29.577 --> 01:09:32.118]  I mean, Paul, Steve, how often do you see stuff like that in the news?
[01:09:33.179 --> 01:09:33.679]  Quite often.
[01:09:33.719 --> 01:09:39.442]  I mean, there was another article about, um, I think it was in Italy, where condoms were tainted by the HIV virus.
[01:09:40.162 --> 01:09:46.385]  Um, but the story about the man who supposedly... How do condoms get tainted by a virus that dies in 25 seconds in open air?
[01:09:47.006 --> 01:09:48.006]  Exactly, it's deliberate.
[01:09:48.026 --> 01:09:57.291]  It's a cover for the other stuff, and then they're killing you with it, and then the virus is just there, and they go, ooh, antibodies for the virus, and then you never look at... It's like I stab you with a sword,
[01:09:58.135 --> 01:10:01.577]  And then make you eat an aspirin as you're bleeding to death, and I say the aspirin killed you.
[01:10:02.298 --> 01:10:03.839]  It just, it's... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:10:04.699 --> 01:10:09.342]  Yeah, it's a story about the guy who beat HIV with vitamins and alternative health.
[01:10:09.982 --> 01:10:11.863]  Again, it highlights a question to me.
[01:10:13.284 --> 01:10:19.248]  Is the EU regulation banning the vitamins in high doses, which are not even high dose?
[01:10:20.223 --> 01:10:24.246]  Is that simply to create a monopoly market and make money?
[01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:35.375]  Or is it because they know that these kind of treatments and alternative therapies aid our health to a magnitude that could never be matched by any pharmaceutical product?
[01:10:35.395 --> 01:10:38.617]  Yeah, we didn't just fall off the turnip truck here, pun intended folks.
[01:10:38.717 --> 01:10:45.002]  We've been saying vitamins can beat it if you didn't totally burn yourself out and if you stopped snorting the methamphetamine.
[01:10:45.549 --> 01:10:50.471]  I mean, I've known several people that died of AIDS in a tertiary manner, and I knew they were drug addicts.
[01:10:50.931 --> 01:10:53.392]  And as they were dying, they were still snorting methamphetamine.
[01:10:53.932 --> 01:10:55.312]  Because the methamphetamine was killing them.
[01:10:55.613 --> 01:10:56.873]  The liver disease was killing them.
[01:10:57.333 --> 01:10:58.894]  That's the type of... I mean, go ahead.
[01:10:59.894 --> 01:11:10.958]  Yeah, Big Pharma's come out immediately after he made the claim and said, we've got to study this, even though he'd had, like, four or five separate tests by separate medical institutions, which said the same thing, that he'd defeated it.
[01:11:11.647 --> 01:11:16.610]  So they're going to come out on the attack, whereas, you know, their poison, Tamiflu, is turning kids in.
[01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:17.450]  Was it Japan?
[01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:18.451]  Suicidal?
[01:11:18.471 --> 01:11:23.193]  Yeah, well, two have committed suicide and twelve have died, and that's just, that's what's being reported.
[01:11:23.614 --> 01:11:27.616]  You know, normally the doctors don't go, the Tamiflu did it, because they think they're going to be liable.
[01:11:27.676 --> 01:11:31.098]  You don't think when you die of malpractice, folks, they go, it's us, we killed you.
[01:11:31.398 --> 01:11:34.840]  So that number is conservatively ten times greater.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.901]  That's the index I'm reporting.
[01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:38.682]  And if it's, um,
[01:11:39.674 --> 01:11:51.960]  Sold as the solution to bird flu, if they play that card with, of course, Rumsfeld and top Bilderberg members owning the stock, you know, that percentage of people becoming ill, suicidal from the Tamiflu is only going to go through the roof.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:57.442]  And last time they owned the stock with the Cipro, and made billions, and it's just the same thing every time.
[01:11:58.115 --> 01:12:04.236]  Yeah, White House was on Cipro before the Anthrax attacks and it led back to Fort Detrick to secure U.S.
[01:12:04.316 --> 01:12:08.557]  base and they'd done the test years before about sending weaponized Anthrax through the mail.
[01:12:09.157 --> 01:12:18.980]  So I mean it's in their agenda to create these bio-attacks because it doesn't necessarily damage their infrastructure but it creates mass panic and terror even on a small level.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.661]  And they get to also at the same time prance around as our saviors.
[01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:24.641]  Does that answer your question Ben in Mississippi?
[01:12:25.864 --> 01:12:33.426]  Yes it does, but the most disturbing thing about it was he alluded to intimate domain and how the government can of course take your property for as he said, the common good.
[01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:38.687]  He said if they can do that, maybe they can take your own DNA.
[01:12:39.667 --> 01:12:40.387]  Was he for that?
[01:12:40.427 --> 01:12:44.048]  The neocons are pushing real hard for killing inmates and taking their organs.
[01:12:44.088 --> 01:12:45.808]  Was he pushing hard?
[01:12:46.469 --> 01:12:48.489]  I mean, was he for it or was he being flippant?
[01:12:49.763 --> 01:12:52.405]  No, he was being, he was actually questioning it.
[01:12:52.685 --> 01:13:00.631]  He was actually raising that as a question that maybe if someone, I mean if the government can take your property as if we're a piece of property.
[01:13:01.171 --> 01:13:05.674]  Well they already call us, we're no longer called employees or staff or members of the team.
[01:13:05.735 --> 01:13:07.656]  We're called human resources.
[01:13:09.157 --> 01:13:12.860]  Yeah, I guess they'll have a ball and chain around my foot, boat over a cotton row here soon.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:22.626]  What do you think about the FDA about the change the rules where they can take mentally ill children or healthy children that have been taken from their parents?
[01:13:23.046 --> 01:13:31.892]  If the government is the guardian, they can test pesticides, chemicals, flame retardants, toxic levels of whatever they want on them.
[01:13:32.152 --> 01:13:33.533]  That's just an expansion of U.S.
[01:13:33.553 --> 01:13:35.054]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1520A, Paragraph B.
[01:13:38.863 --> 01:13:43.784]  Yeah, I heard you talk about that last night on Coast to Coast, and I think that's very sick and very evil.
[01:13:44.144 --> 01:13:50.006]  I mean, if we don't protect, as you said, the infirm and the lesser among us, then we've all had it.
[01:13:51.306 --> 01:13:52.307]  We really have.
[01:13:52.807 --> 01:13:54.187]  I got pretty fired up last night.
[01:13:54.207 --> 01:13:56.148]  You think I was too fired up on the show, or you think it was good?
[01:13:56.208 --> 01:13:56.848]  No, I don't.
[01:13:56.908 --> 01:13:58.928]  It was excellent, excellent, as always.
[01:13:58.948 --> 01:13:59.669]  As always.
[01:14:02.017 --> 01:14:03.898]  Well, we appreciate George Norrie having us on.
[01:14:03.938 --> 01:14:06.060]  Thanks for the call, Ben.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:10.984]  We've got to thank George Norrie because he's taken that show in a new direction.
[01:14:11.224 --> 01:14:17.308]  I'd say about 40% of his guests now are hardcore anti-New World Order and in the past it was about 5% were.
[01:14:21.672 --> 01:14:24.314]  There is no venue that big letting us get the word out.
[01:14:25.535 --> 01:14:26.115]  It's exciting.
[01:14:27.136 --> 01:14:28.317]  Any comments on Coast to Coast AM?
[01:14:29.304 --> 01:14:32.105]  Well yeah, what is it, 20 million listeners, roughly, tonight?
[01:14:32.705 --> 01:14:33.846]  It's a great opportunity.
[01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.346]  It's one that's never been there before.
[01:14:35.886 --> 01:14:40.468]  And as you said, George and Uri's taking it in the direction of really hardcore information.
[01:14:40.848 --> 01:14:47.430]  They're kind of moving away from the more amorphous stuff that you can't prove, although it's interesting and that's how they got the views in the first place.
[01:14:47.771 --> 01:14:54.613]  But now they're tackling really hardcore issues and we can only commend them for it and thank them for giving us the opportunity to be involved with that.
[01:14:54.653 --> 01:14:57.094]  I mean, they never tell me what I can or can't talk about.
[01:14:57.134 --> 01:15:00.976]  I just come on the air and I can talk about the FDA about to approve the murder of children.
[01:15:01.576 --> 01:15:02.717]  I mean, I appreciate that.
[01:15:02.737 --> 01:15:04.118]  I mean, I want to save these kids.
[01:15:05.038 --> 01:15:10.901]  And talking to our couple million listeners is great, but to be able to reach that new audience all the time, that is really important.
[01:15:11.596 --> 01:15:12.817]  And so kudos to George Norrie.
[01:15:12.837 --> 01:15:16.619]  In fact, folks, email him and tell him that I said on air I appreciate him.
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.480]  He needs to be supported.
[01:15:18.661 --> 01:15:32.349]  When they start doing the right thing, when the media starts taking a bold stance, when people are doing a good job, you know, Lou Dobbs, when he's done good on the immigration issue and a few other issues like NAFTA and GATT and the free trade area of the Americas, he helped kill that.
[01:15:32.889 --> 01:15:34.911]  Hugo Chavez does the right thing, we've got to thank him.
[01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:38.333]  I mean, when people in power do the right thing, we need to support them.
[01:15:39.438 --> 01:15:40.740]  And it's just that simple.
[01:15:41.581 --> 01:15:44.925]  But let's go ahead and talk to Maureen in Washington.
[01:15:44.945 --> 01:15:45.725]  Maureen, you're on the air.
[01:15:45.746 --> 01:15:46.106]  Go ahead.
[01:15:46.526 --> 01:15:47.227]  Oh, hi Alex.
[01:15:47.447 --> 01:15:47.748]  Hi.
[01:15:48.148 --> 01:15:52.113]  I wanted to talk about the EPA testing of chemicals on children and babies.
[01:15:52.393 --> 01:15:52.674]  Yes.
[01:15:53.194 --> 01:15:58.600]  I'm an MKUltra survivor and I have a story of what they did to me.
[01:16:00.570 --> 01:16:02.452]  Well, that was actually declassified in the 70s.
[01:16:02.672 --> 01:16:06.735]  It was even on History Channel about five years ago and I interviewed some of the women.
[01:16:06.775 --> 01:16:07.936]  This is mainstream news.
[01:16:08.336 --> 01:16:12.380]  Dr. Ewing Cameron even lost lawsuits over it up in Canada at the CIA base.
[01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:19.125]  They had their thousands, I forget the exact number, I want to say 5,000, I know it was in the thousands, 6,000.
[01:16:20.866 --> 01:16:21.307]  Yes, we are.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.823]  And they would say, give them to us, you've got to institutionalize them.
[01:16:42.123 --> 01:16:45.606]  And they'd get them for a few years and first they do shock therapy.
[01:16:46.146 --> 01:16:46.727]  Therapy, yeah.
[01:16:46.747 --> 01:16:48.708]  It's like shooting yourself in the head and calling it therapy.
[01:16:49.129 --> 01:17:02.780]  Then for six months, every day, LSD, PCP, peyote, mescaline, cocktails, mushrooms, cocktails of this with headsets on, just like I'm wearing right now, scrapped in with
[01:17:05.582 --> 01:17:06.403]  We're good to go.
[01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:34.482]  I'm not saying that you're not telling the truth.
[01:17:34.502 --> 01:17:35.182]  You are telling the truth.
[01:17:35.562 --> 01:17:37.223]  I'm just saying you're making this claim.
[01:17:37.784 --> 01:17:38.944]  We can confirm it.
[01:17:39.004 --> 01:17:39.685]  This is public.
[01:17:39.705 --> 01:17:40.065]  Go ahead.
[01:17:40.325 --> 01:17:40.645]  Okay.
[01:17:40.746 --> 01:17:43.547]  Well, I have a website in which I describe what happened to me.
[01:17:43.647 --> 01:17:47.470]  I'm old enough to remember the Nazis in full uniform.
[01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:51.772]  And I was a part of the UFO hoax, which it was a hoax.
[01:17:52.493 --> 01:17:53.974]  They dressed me up like a gray.
[01:17:53.994 --> 01:17:55.775]  Okay, so I don't believe this.
[01:17:56.812 --> 01:17:57.572]  You don't believe me?
[01:17:57.832 --> 01:18:15.298]  Well, see, it's always gotta... MKUltra's admitted, they did that, they tortured these children, they really did it, but no, you, they dressed you up like a gray and you were... Well, wait a minute, wait a minute, before... Fighting with the turkeys and... Wait a minute, before you discount me, would you read what I have on my website?
[01:18:16.479 --> 01:18:17.599]  Yes, I'll read it.
[01:18:17.619 --> 01:18:18.179]  Tell me about it.
[01:18:18.399 --> 01:18:18.760]  Okay.
[01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:25.002]  The website is www.reflectionsinthenight.com.
[01:18:27.538 --> 01:18:28.018]  You know what I'll do?
[01:18:28.058 --> 01:18:29.999]  I'll check your website out, and it may be credible.
[01:18:30.939 --> 01:18:31.239]  Why?
[01:18:32.319 --> 01:18:32.800]  And you know what?
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.600]  If I think it is, I'll have you on as a guest, okay?
[01:18:34.660 --> 01:18:35.700]  I'm sure you're a very nice person.
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:36.201]  Thanks for the call.
[01:18:36.261 --> 01:18:40.062]  I just... I just, you know... The EPA is changing these rules.
[01:18:40.102 --> 01:18:41.022]  This is on their website.
[01:18:41.062 --> 01:18:41.742]  This is happening.
[01:18:42.362 --> 01:18:51.785]  The government did do this to people, and I think if we mix in, dressed up... If we mix space aliens into it, it just... I just can't handle it.
[01:18:53.752 --> 01:18:57.636]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[01:18:57.776 --> 01:18:59.517]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[01:18:59.597 --> 01:19:00.839]  But not just any water.
[01:19:00.919 --> 01:19:05.143]  You need Electrolyzed Iodized Water, or EO, from RPA Biotech.
[01:19:05.203 --> 01:19:14.911]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[01:19:15.672 --> 01:19:16.053]  I don't know.

[01:19:54.818 --> 01:19:59.303]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:59.663 --> 01:20:03.747]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:04.047 --> 01:20:04.588]  We listened.
[01:20:04.908 --> 01:20:09.893]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:10.153 --> 01:20:10.654]  We listened.
[01:20:11.034 --> 01:20:14.077]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:14.498 --> 01:20:15.038]  We listened.
[01:20:15.499 --> 01:20:17.841]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping.
[01:20:19.907 --> 01:20:20.407]  We listened.
[01:20:20.748 --> 01:20:25.991]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:20:26.411 --> 01:20:27.752]  Again, we listened.
[01:20:28.132 --> 01:20:35.517]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.

[01:20:54.256 --> 01:20:56.579]  Here it is folks, the 2006 Red Book.
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.564]  The most comprehensive edition ever published.
[01:21:00.296 --> 01:21:03.939]  Midas Resources believes our clients should be as informed as possible.

[01:21:33.701 --> 01:21:33.761]  1-800-686-2237.
[01:21:53.337 --> 01:21:54.138]  Attention Drivers!
[01:21:54.438 --> 01:21:56.980]  Poor fuel quality is on its way to your local gas station.
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:00.582]  Due to fuel shortages, the EPA has relaxed environmental standards.
[01:22:00.902 --> 01:22:05.766]  On top of that, fuel refiners have reduced detergents and fuel by 50% over the last five years.
[01:22:06.126 --> 01:22:09.809]  Poor fuel restricts injectors and deposits build up in your car's combustion chambers.
[01:22:10.209 --> 01:22:11.269]  What does this mean for your vehicle?
[01:22:11.569 --> 01:22:14.570]  Poor mileage and reduced performance in a time of record fuel prices.
[01:22:14.890 --> 01:22:15.531]  There is an answer.
[01:22:15.811 --> 01:22:21.933]  Protekta Complete Fuel System Treatment cleans injectors and combustion chambers to 95% of new in only one tank full.
[01:22:22.193 --> 01:22:28.895]  Plus, a special mileage improver designed and fleet tested by a major oil company to improve mileage even on new cars by up to 4%.
[01:22:29.595 --> 01:22:31.816]  The mileage improvement lasts for an entire oil change.
[01:22:32.116 --> 01:22:36.077]  So quit wasting unburned fuel and get more when you treat your car right with Protekta.

[01:22:46.327 --> 01:22:46.607]  That's 888-873-7371.
[01:22:56.954 --> 01:22:58.896]  A little shout out to the Alamo Drafthouse.
[01:22:58.936 --> 01:23:08.925]  They were already sold out for I Walk the Line, or Walk the Line Johnny Cash movie tonight, but I got some tickets.
[01:23:09.646 --> 01:23:11.808]  We're going to be going to that tonight, Alamo Drafthouse.
[01:23:13.536 --> 01:23:25.427]  Okay, I don't know why I'm talking about the movie I'm going to go see on the air, but you see what happens is, again, I'm in studio now, I have guests in studio, I'm not in my little cubbyhole pod on board a gray spaceship that I used to do.
[01:23:25.787 --> 01:23:26.868]  That's a joke, folks!
[01:23:27.488 --> 01:23:40.400]  Look, to the lady earlier, Paul was saying that a lot of evidence shows, and this is true, that black helicopters are associated with cattle mutilations that really do happen, that a lot of people that are getting kidnapped by people in these little rubber suits,
[01:23:41.192 --> 01:23:47.894]  Are being taken to underground facilities that we know exist, and that this is part of some larger government psyops.
[01:23:48.454 --> 01:23:51.535]  And we've even gotten government documents on potential plans.
[01:23:51.955 --> 01:23:52.775]  This has been admitted!
[01:23:53.176 --> 01:24:05.099]  They considered it in the first Iraq invasion to have a fake alien invasion with these big projectors that can shoot like a 500 foot across, 200 foot tall spaceship, or Buddha, or Jesus, or Allah.
[01:24:07.474 --> 01:24:09.315]  You see these Las Vegas lights and all this?
[01:24:09.355 --> 01:24:11.016]  I've seen those in the stuff of Mexico City.
[01:24:11.336 --> 01:24:12.877]  It's obviously a hologram.
[01:24:13.217 --> 01:24:18.800]  Yeah, you've got two million people in Mexico City look up and see it, and then you look at it and it's blinking in and out.
[01:24:19.080 --> 01:24:23.563]  It's always shot up into a cloud where the holograms can really form themselves.
[01:24:24.823 --> 01:24:27.585]  Now we're really off in La La Land, but the lady brought it up.
[01:24:28.125 --> 01:24:29.466]  Paul, you had comments during the break.
[01:24:29.486 --> 01:24:30.207]  Let's just bring it out.
[01:24:30.227 --> 01:24:30.987]  Let's just talk about it.
[01:24:32.173 --> 01:24:35.595]  Well, it's in the report from Iron Mountain, another similar document.
[01:24:35.615 --> 01:24:40.157]  Some people don't think they're credible, but as Alex said, it's been admitted that they could be.
[01:24:40.197 --> 01:24:46.261]  Well, we have Clinton's former Chief of Staff is the head of the Big Quote Disclosure Movement, and we have Big Rothschild's funding.
[01:24:46.461 --> 01:24:47.661]  I'm sorry, it's all in your book.
[01:24:47.681 --> 01:24:48.302]  Tell us about it.
[01:24:48.362 --> 01:24:56.046]  Yeah, there's a chapter in Order Out of Chaos called Counterfeit Foe, the next Hegelian dialectic, something like that.
[01:24:56.789 --> 01:25:08.917]  It's basically, when terrorism has run its course, they're probably going to use universal threats, as Reagan said in that speech in the UN, as the next fear-mongering tool.
[01:25:08.957 --> 01:25:18.524]  So it could come from asteroids, weather, which they seem to be using at the moment, or even UFO invasions that are staged.
[01:25:18.624 --> 01:25:20.365]  It's not like out there to say that.
[01:25:20.765 --> 01:25:23.047]  It could happen five, ten years in the future.
[01:25:23.707 --> 01:25:29.991]  As Alex was saying, a lot of these abductions indicate that it's basically military testing.
[01:25:30.031 --> 01:25:33.573]  They abduct people and do testing on them.
[01:25:33.613 --> 01:25:38.096]  I'll say this, about 98% of the people saying it are complete lunatics.
[01:25:38.156 --> 01:25:42.159]  It doesn't help things to have the news saying, take your microchip to prove you're good.
[01:25:42.439 --> 01:25:48.563]  Andy Rooney and the former Health and Human Services Secretary Thompson, they really are on TV saying, take your chip.
[01:25:51.585 --> 01:26:00.308]  Sean Hannity on Fox News, a little clip of it, is actually in the film The Masters of Terror, and he says, every child needs a chip, I'm buying stock, take your chip.
[01:26:00.328 --> 01:26:02.849]  I mean, we're living in this bizarro world.
[01:26:02.989 --> 01:26:04.169]  What does that do to schizophrenics?
[01:26:04.229 --> 01:26:06.210]  It drives them right off the edge of a cliff.
[01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:08.470]  I mean, they're just howling at the moon with all this happening.
[01:26:09.091 --> 01:26:12.472]  So, again, we have an insane elite pushing insane things.
[01:26:12.872 --> 01:26:14.512]  You've got crazy people going nuts.
[01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:17.593]  Then you've got real cases of real things going on.
[01:26:17.613 --> 01:26:19.094]  It gets to where you don't know what to believe.
[01:26:20.862 --> 01:26:22.163]  That's why we steer away from it.
[01:26:23.764 --> 01:26:28.447]  Yeah, I mean, you need to keep it in its own box and separate it from the real stuff that you can prove.
[01:26:28.467 --> 01:26:31.329]  You can idly speculate on it, and it's interesting to do so.
[01:26:31.869 --> 01:26:38.453]  But a lot of it, like, you know, this big black flying triangle that people see, it's simply the new Aurora space plane.
[01:26:38.473 --> 01:26:40.915]  The technology is 10, 15 years ahead of its time.
[01:26:40.935 --> 01:26:43.256]  And that's what Jane's Weapons Encyclopedia says.
[01:26:43.356 --> 01:26:43.877]  Yeah.
[01:26:43.957 --> 01:26:45.518]  And they reported a decade before on the B-2.
[01:26:47.037 --> 01:26:53.441]  Yeah, I mean they hold the technology back, and when it gets seen being tested publicly, people think it's spaceships and so forth.
[01:26:53.501 --> 01:26:54.321]  And they love that.
[01:26:54.481 --> 01:26:58.684]  I mean, they would use that as the cover for future technology.
[01:26:58.724 --> 01:27:01.786]  That's what happened with F-16s, F-17 fighters.
[01:27:02.626 --> 01:27:07.129]  People were seeing those and saying they were spaceships back in the 70s, early 70s.
[01:27:07.389 --> 01:27:12.492]  I remember driving home from Fairfield, Texas, seeing my grandparents to Dallas on I-45.
[01:27:12.832 --> 01:27:13.713]  My dad saw all this.
[01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:15.603]  I don't know what was going on.
[01:27:15.623 --> 01:27:20.226]  They had an army tank going down the shoulder and it was tearing the asphalt up.
[01:27:21.367 --> 01:27:25.090]  It's the type of tank, the older tank, before the Abrams.
[01:27:25.770 --> 01:27:30.574]  And we look over and there's some weird plane I've never seen before and never seen since.
[01:27:30.594 --> 01:27:32.895]  I don't know, it's probably ten-fold or so.
[01:27:33.396 --> 01:27:34.396]  My dad's like, look at that!
[01:27:34.436 --> 01:27:36.158]  I still have this image of it.
[01:27:36.518 --> 01:27:39.180]  And there were troops and some kind of maneuver was going on.
[01:27:40.094 --> 01:27:45.138]  They had some kind of strange aircraft flying low and slow, but it was a jet.
[01:27:45.158 --> 01:27:47.880]  I mean, there's so much stuff going on, folks.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:48.741]  I mean, come on.
[01:27:49.762 --> 01:27:56.127]  They still say the SR-71 Blackbird, in service in 1959, retired in what, 1980, is still the fastest plane?
[01:27:56.147 --> 01:27:57.968]  I mean, do you believe that, folks?
[01:27:59.530 --> 01:28:02.992]  Yeah, so the Salisbury plane in England, this big black triangle's been seen.
[01:28:03.012 --> 01:28:04.554]  That's a military testing ground.
[01:28:05.094 --> 01:28:07.196]  That's basically what it is in 99% of the cases.
[01:28:09.435 --> 01:28:16.480]  Yeah, you're always seeing it at military testing grounds, and then they go, oh, the aliens are visiting us at the military skunk works, where they test experimental aircraft.
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:20.743]  Wow, we're seeing weird, weird, weird objects at the experimental testing ground.
[01:28:21.384 --> 01:28:30.510]  It's, it's not our government, it's purple blood-sucking goblins from the 4000th dimension, under rheumoroid-reptoid control.
[01:28:32.031 --> 01:28:37.155]  Well, I just, I'm sorry folks, uh, you, you got the wrong show, because
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.723]  We're about verifying, verifying, verifying.
[01:28:43.664 --> 01:28:44.585]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.065 --> 01:28:46.666]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.587 --> 01:28:50.289]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:29:02.405]  Did you know that recent estimates by the Arthritis Foundation put the number of Americans with arthritis or chronic joint symptoms at 66 million, or 1 in 3 adults?
[01:29:02.425 --> 01:29:07.047]  Or that arthritis is the nation's leading cause of disability among Americans over age 15?
[01:29:07.388 --> 01:29:11.330]  Most individuals diagnosed with arthritis don't think anything can be done to help.
[01:29:11.670 --> 01:29:16.693]  Those who are aware of treatment options fear the debilitating side effects associated with prescription drugs.
[01:29:17.133 --> 01:29:20.915]  At ResearchedHerbs.com, we feature herbal formulations like Joint Care,
[01:29:21.175 --> 01:29:21.816]  We're good to go!
[01:29:45.452 --> 01:29:48.733]  1-800-845-3841 to learn more.
[01:29:49.854 --> 01:29:50.994]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[01:29:53.295 --> 01:29:55.216]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter.
[01:29:55.316 --> 01:30:00.818]  An inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[01:30:01.098 --> 01:30:12.002]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because incredibly they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[01:30:12.262 --> 01:30:14.064]  Yet require very little energy.
[01:30:14.344 --> 01:30:17.667]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[01:30:18.008 --> 01:30:19.349]  But it's worth every penny.
[01:30:19.469 --> 01:30:28.458]  Because the low energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[01:30:28.758 --> 01:30:29.259]  That's right!
[01:30:29.419 --> 01:30:36.545]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[01:30:36.845 --> 01:30:40.969]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[01:30:41.129 --> 01:30:45.592]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.632 --> 01:30:46.093]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:53.599 --> 01:30:55.141]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:30:55.301 --> 01:30:56.422]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:30:56.602 --> 01:31:00.025]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:00.125 --> 01:31:00.566]  Phenol?
[01:31:00.886 --> 01:31:07.992]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:31:08.293 --> 01:31:12.396]  EDTA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:31:12.516 --> 01:31:12.957]  Fragrance?
[01:31:13.317 --> 01:31:18.082]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:31:18.222 --> 01:31:22.887]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:31:23.128 --> 01:31:25.670]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my CalBen shampoo.
[01:31:25.951 --> 01:31:29.354]  Well, like all of the products from the CalBen Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:31:29.514 --> 01:31:33.098]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:31:33.258 --> 01:31:33.899]  No harsh chemicals.
[01:31:33.899 --> 01:31:35.019]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:35.039 --> 01:31:36.300]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:04.582 --> 01:32:11.130]  Alright, at 8 after in the next hour we're going to re-air that Paul Craig Roberts interview that was just amazing last Friday in case you missed it.
[01:32:11.150 --> 01:32:14.755]  A lot of you have asked that we re-air it so you can record it and get it out to people.
[01:32:14.775 --> 01:32:20.902]  You can also always go to GCNlive.com and get a membership and download and listen to all the shows and everything there.
[01:32:22.003 --> 01:32:23.305]  You can also go to
[01:32:24.767 --> 01:32:25.247]  We're good to go.
[01:32:46.975 --> 01:32:47.835]  That we've done this week.
[01:32:47.876 --> 01:32:51.359]  We're going to put up then two separate reports from the live TV shows.
[01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:57.565]  That's, I mean, a fully edited 30-minute TV program we did with Ben Livingston.
[01:32:58.566 --> 01:33:03.911]  You know, all edited with documents and talking about weather control and confirmed, patented U.S.
[01:33:03.951 --> 01:33:06.733]  government weather control.
[01:33:06.813 --> 01:33:07.474]  It's all there.
[01:33:08.471 --> 01:33:10.633]  That piece is going to be up there also.
[01:33:11.574 --> 01:33:12.955]  It's novel, but it's interesting.
[01:33:13.395 --> 01:33:15.357]  About 25 minutes of us live in studios.
[01:33:15.397 --> 01:33:20.742]  You can see the studio and see Paul and Steve screwing around during the breaks and stuff.
[01:33:23.484 --> 01:33:31.090]  We put so much on PrisonPlanet.tv that you won't see in films, that you won't see on TV, that you won't see anywhere else.
[01:33:31.170 --> 01:33:36.555]  PrisonPlanet.tv and that helps fund the four webmasters we've got.
[01:33:37.465 --> 01:33:41.826]  And the bandwidth and the four servers and all of what we do.
[01:33:41.927 --> 01:33:43.387]  You make it possible.
[01:33:43.487 --> 01:33:43.887]  You do.
[01:33:43.907 --> 01:33:46.868]  So I want to thank you for all of your support.
[01:33:47.268 --> 01:33:48.889]  Go to PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:33:49.209 --> 01:33:50.229]  That's PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:33:50.429 --> 01:33:52.430]  It's like television.
[01:33:53.370 --> 01:33:55.671]  And it is 15 cents a day.
[01:33:55.691 --> 01:33:59.612]  And if you get a yearly subscription, you get three months for free.
[01:33:59.652 --> 01:34:01.213]  But there are monthly subscriptions for $5.95.
[01:34:02.173 --> 01:34:05.634]  A cup of coffee costs you a dollar on average.
[01:34:06.297 --> 01:34:09.079]  I know this cup of coffee from across the street probably costs about $1.50.
[01:34:09.239 --> 01:34:11.160]  It's lavishly expensive.
[01:34:11.180 --> 01:34:13.662]  I don't know if it's gold coffee beans or something.
[01:34:14.522 --> 01:34:18.685]  And it makes possible everything we're doing.
[01:34:19.065 --> 01:34:20.426]  Get my Phil Marshall log.
[01:34:20.466 --> 01:34:22.607]  Get the new Codex Magicka book we're carrying.
[01:34:23.368 --> 01:34:25.429]  Over a thousand photographs and documents in it.
[01:34:25.469 --> 01:34:26.550]  Six hundred and something pages.
[01:34:26.590 --> 01:34:27.170]  Three pounds.
[01:34:27.190 --> 01:34:30.372]  It's bigger than the Fort Worth phone book actually.
[01:34:30.472 --> 01:34:32.293]  It's almost as big as the Dallas phone book.
[01:34:32.334 --> 01:34:32.954]  It's ridiculous.
[01:34:33.990 --> 01:34:37.013]  Get all of these documentaries, the books on tape.
[01:34:37.434 --> 01:34:46.843]  Go peruse the Safe Secure Shopping Cart on InfoWars.com and get the videos, make copies of them, get them out to people, affect change in your area.
[01:34:47.784 --> 01:34:56.512]  Here is the toll free number to call and ask questions or ask about different specials we're offering or to order videos or books or t-shirts, any of the materials that can answer your questions.
[01:34:58.064 --> 01:34:58.645]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:58.685 --> 01:34:59.025]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:34:59.145 --> 01:35:03.871]  Or you can just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas 78704.
[01:35:18.303 --> 01:35:24.269]  I'm going to talk to Ron, Jeff, Andrew and Tom and that's going to be it because I want to get into a little bit about what happened in London when we were there.
[01:35:24.609 --> 01:35:29.974]  I want to get off into, well first we'll cover some of the news we haven't gotten to and then we'll get off into London.
[01:35:30.534 --> 01:35:37.080]  But I do hope that listeners out there will take advantage of the specials we're running until the first of the year, then they're gone.
[01:35:37.841 --> 01:35:39.563]  Let's talk to Ron in New York.
[01:35:39.623 --> 01:35:40.744]  Ron, you're on the air, go ahead.
[01:35:41.224 --> 01:35:42.404]  Yes, good afternoon, gentlemen.
[01:35:43.064 --> 01:35:47.545]  There's something I'd like to bring to the attention of your listeners a little bit closer to earth.
[01:35:48.085 --> 01:35:51.866]  This went by pretty much, I think, unnoticed by most people.
[01:35:52.626 --> 01:36:02.068]  And it was in reference to a piece of legislation that passed the House of Representatives about a week ago, and it's referred to as the Secure Access to Justice and Court Protection Act.
[01:36:03.328 --> 01:36:08.989]  Now, there were amendments added to that bill, and I think they're what make it even the most onerous thing of all.
[01:36:09.659 --> 01:36:21.406]  What they did is they put an amendment through, there wasn't much discussion, it was passed on a voice vote, with regards to the posting of what they referred to as personal data on police officers over the internet.
[01:36:22.087 --> 01:36:30.912]  Now, they're all legitimate cases in which I do understand that that could be a problem, or a hazard, and they couched the debate in those terms they spoke of, for instance,
[01:36:31.545 --> 01:36:32.466]  That's what it's about.
[01:36:32.486 --> 01:36:39.472]  Basically, the law is written so broadly that it wouldn't just include those legitimate cases where we should be careful, and I'm in favor of that.
[01:36:39.492 --> 01:36:40.373]  I'm not fanatical.
[01:36:40.473 --> 01:36:41.874]  However, it includes other cases
[01:36:53.283 --> 01:36:58.885]  Where it would wind up shielding police misconduct from shame or from public mention.
[01:36:59.405 --> 01:36:59.926]  That's wrong.
[01:37:00.506 --> 01:37:00.986]  That's wrong.
[01:37:01.406 --> 01:37:05.188]  The law shouldn't be that broad, and it appears as though it may be written that broadly.
[01:37:05.788 --> 01:37:07.428]  And it's now in the U.S.
[01:37:07.468 --> 01:37:10.990]  Senate, and I think your listeners should pay a call to their U.S.
[01:37:11.010 --> 01:37:11.390]  Senators.
[01:37:12.071 --> 01:37:16.298]  And ask them just what is going on with this bill, in particular that amendment.
[01:37:16.799 --> 01:37:18.041]  Again, let me state it clearly.
[01:37:18.101 --> 01:37:24.291]  Well, I'm in favor of certain restrictions where you have genuine and legitimate threats.
[01:37:25.154 --> 01:37:35.596]  That law should not be so expansive as to suppress appropriate criticism or the notation of unethical police misconduct either.
[01:37:36.136 --> 01:37:36.556]  I hear you.
[01:37:36.576 --> 01:37:37.877]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[01:37:38.597 --> 01:37:40.617]  Let's talk to Jeff.
[01:37:40.677 --> 01:37:41.777]  Let's go ahead and talk to Jeff.
[01:37:41.797 --> 01:37:42.818]  Where are you calling from, Jeff?
[01:37:43.198 --> 01:37:43.558]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:44.438 --> 01:37:50.039]  Back to what you were talking about earlier with the fake Christians on TV and all that stuff.
[01:37:50.519 --> 01:37:53.440]  It goes in with the Grove, and it's just a couple of little points, and I'll be as clear as I can.
[01:37:55.252 --> 01:37:59.835]  The thing is, I'm a member of Prison Planet TV and I've got your new Bohemian Grove release.
[01:38:00.436 --> 01:38:05.619]  And I was watching it, kind of listening to the words, or looking at the words of what's said during the ceremony.
[01:38:06.161 --> 01:38:14.543]  And it just amazes me, the tithing with the Old Testament, exactly, where Gideon... Oh no, no, this is deeply, deeply, this is black magic!
[01:38:14.603 --> 01:38:15.984]  Oh, they're just having fun!
[01:38:16.324 --> 01:38:20.265]  No, everything they say is... I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:38:20.285 --> 01:38:25.866]  Well, that's the thing, Gideon, before he could free the people from the Midianites, had to knock down the idol and burn the grove.
[01:38:26.526 --> 01:38:31.748]  And then, the thing about it, when Tarith's talking during the ceremony, he said that, you know,
[01:38:32.840 --> 01:38:34.261]  I believe it says, The Voice of Hawaii.
[01:38:34.281 --> 01:38:36.263]  Year after year, you burn me in this grove.
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:56.685]  Paul and Angel were referred to in the Old Testament as princes, and Daniel 10 talks about the Prince of Persia... Look, the whole thing, and written in the stones of Babylon and Goodly Tyre, where they did the Moloch sacrifices, but it's worse than that.
[01:38:57.225 --> 01:39:07.468]  If you really study the occultism behind it, and a listener pointed this out when I screened it at the Alamo Draft House here locally a few months ago, or actually a few weeks ago,
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:10.021]  He said, are you familiar with Faust?
[01:39:10.081 --> 01:39:11.222]  And I had read the original.
[01:39:11.262 --> 01:39:12.062]  Faust is a real guy.
[01:39:12.142 --> 01:39:14.143]  I went in like 1540 there in Germany.
[01:39:14.823 --> 01:39:19.986]  But the book written a few hundred years later about Faust, in there it's care.
[01:39:20.026 --> 01:39:25.169]  There's like four or five things that the demon tricks him at the stop police, tricks him into giving up.
[01:39:25.209 --> 01:39:27.730]  And one of them is care, but care escapes out of the box.
[01:39:28.582 --> 01:39:31.103]  So they're also killing cares like metastabolize.
[01:39:31.163 --> 01:39:32.224]  No, I've got your care.
[01:39:32.244 --> 01:39:32.744]  I've got it.
[01:39:33.145 --> 01:39:34.325]  I mean, this is sick, folks.
[01:39:35.166 --> 01:39:36.626]  Everything they say is demonic.
[01:39:36.686 --> 01:39:37.667]  It's just pure.
[01:39:38.227 --> 01:39:38.828]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:39:38.988 --> 01:39:50.994]  Well, in the New Testament, when there was a part where Jesus went to a place and a person that was possessed with a demon actually saw Christ, came and bowed down before him and said, Have you come to torment me before the time?
[01:39:51.394 --> 01:39:53.616]  And that's the thing in the ceremony.
[01:39:53.656 --> 01:39:56.017]  They say, We know that you wait for us.
[01:39:57.067 --> 01:40:02.932]  You know, after our Sylvan holiday has ended, but I mean, they acknowledge the fact that they're going to answer for it.
[01:40:03.052 --> 01:40:04.533]  And they said, don't fight him.
[01:40:04.833 --> 01:40:08.596]  And just the words of terror, where he says, you know, spit upon your fire, you can't burn me with these words.
[01:40:08.616 --> 01:40:08.976]  Do me a favor.
[01:40:08.996 --> 01:40:10.317]  You know, I'm so busy.
[01:40:10.417 --> 01:40:13.359]  Every time I watch you, I mean to write this up and discuss this.
[01:40:13.739 --> 01:40:14.660]  You have the knowledge.
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:16.101]  You're saying exactly the truth.
[01:40:16.501 --> 01:40:18.783]  You even have the Bible verses better than I do.
[01:40:18.843 --> 01:40:20.264]  I just want the Sunday School to remember them.
[01:40:21.605 --> 01:40:22.646]  Write me an article.
[01:40:23.186 --> 01:40:23.767]  Do you have email?
[01:40:24.748 --> 01:40:30.196]  And email it to tips at infowars.com to make sure we don't miss it with all the spam.
[01:40:30.477 --> 01:40:31.739]  Paul, give them your little email.
[01:40:32.240 --> 01:40:35.164]  It's prisonplanetweb at hotmail.com
[01:40:36.258 --> 01:40:37.939]  PrisonPlanetWeb at Hotmail.com.
[01:40:38.379 --> 01:40:42.140]  And so what do you say to people that watch it and go, oh I'm a Christian, Bush is a Christian.
[01:40:42.420 --> 01:40:43.781]  They're just having fun.
[01:40:44.061 --> 01:40:48.643]  No, it's all totally crafted with incredible knowledge of the Bible to be blasphemous.
[01:40:48.683 --> 01:40:57.986]  It's like Pat Robertson going, oh Jesus, Jesus, while he's talking about healing somebody and he calls down the power and then actually invokes the spell.
[01:40:58.266 --> 01:41:00.907]  I mean, that's what they do in black magic, people!
[01:41:01.147 --> 01:41:02.708]  They use the name of Jesus!
[01:41:03.388 --> 01:41:03.928]  Absolutely.
[01:41:04.249 --> 01:41:06.350]  I lost my point.
[01:41:06.430 --> 01:41:09.432]  I forgot what I was going to say there.
[01:41:09.832 --> 01:41:10.112]  Dang it.
[01:41:10.152 --> 01:41:10.632]  Let's see.
[01:41:10.773 --> 01:41:13.654]  The thing about care... I forgot my thought.
[01:41:13.714 --> 01:41:15.115]  Anyway, good job.
[01:41:15.355 --> 01:41:16.316]  The Whatty What.
[01:41:16.356 --> 01:41:17.577]  Have a safe trip home.
[01:41:17.777 --> 01:41:18.657]  I'm listening and I'm on it.
[01:41:19.318 --> 01:41:19.818]  Yeah, listen.
[01:41:19.858 --> 01:41:22.720]  Send us an email and send it to Paul and we'll get it posted.
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:23.620]  It's a great point, sir.
[01:41:23.860 --> 01:41:24.121]  Okay.
[01:41:24.161 --> 01:41:24.541]  Thank you, sir.
[01:41:24.921 --> 01:41:26.142]  Yeah, we need your help, folks.
[01:41:26.942 --> 01:41:30.544]  People are calling who are legitimate, know what they're talking about, got information.
[01:41:30.564 --> 01:41:31.245]  Send it to us.
[01:41:32.054 --> 01:41:33.895]  And if you send it, nothing happens in four or five days.
[01:41:33.915 --> 01:41:34.455]  Send it again.
[01:41:34.475 --> 01:41:37.697]  I mean, tell them what it's like reading an email.
[01:41:37.737 --> 01:41:38.397]  And keep it coming.
[01:41:38.417 --> 01:41:40.178]  It's just like we're wallowing in thousands.
[01:41:40.818 --> 01:41:44.760]  Well, we get material which is worthy for the website every day.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:49.462]  The problem is sifting through all the spam, which I get, you know, 2,000 a day of.
[01:41:49.842 --> 01:41:56.745]  But we are trying to make a concerted effort to take more of the material that you send in and use that on the websites.
[01:41:56.925 --> 01:41:58.686]  So we're looking to pick up on that.
[01:41:58.786 --> 01:42:12.117]  We also want you to analyze propaganda on TV, and if you can get a screenshot of it, or get a shot off the TV show's website, and then tell us the show number, and then send us the plot of the show, and what propaganda you saw, we're going to create a huge section on that.
[01:42:12.898 --> 01:42:15.640]  Because that, again, I keep saying it for years, we've got to make the shift.
[01:42:16.041 --> 01:42:19.283]  Most of the propaganda is not in the news, it's on the TV shows.
[01:42:19.584 --> 01:42:19.904]  Fiction.
[01:42:20.524 --> 01:42:24.548]  Okay, I'm going to take two more calls, because we've got to cover news, and talk a little bit about London.
[01:42:25.028 --> 01:42:26.510]  Let's talk to Andrew in New York.
[01:42:27.611 --> 01:42:33.873]  Mr. Jones, I read something extremely disturbing today in my local pre-weekly newspaper.
[01:42:33.913 --> 01:42:35.093]  I thought I'd pass it on to you.
[01:42:35.113 --> 01:42:38.655]  I would have emailed it to you, but my laptop is not very healthy at the moment.
[01:42:39.535 --> 01:42:45.157]  I would like to refer you to News & Blue's section of Syracuse New Times on the fourth page.
[01:42:45.297 --> 01:42:46.537]  It's the fathers of invention.
[01:42:47.077 --> 01:42:55.520]  California inventor Elwood Woody Norris, he invented a soundless sound system that works by sending a focused beam of sound above the range of human hearing.
[01:42:55.945 --> 01:43:05.229]  People at whom the beam is directed hear the sound coming from inside their head and he says, imagine you are a lifeguard or coach and you want to yell at somebody, he'll be the only one to hear you, he explained.
[01:43:05.469 --> 01:43:12.732]  No, I've had the CEO of the company that's already put those in coke machines in Japan and China five years ago.
[01:43:12.972 --> 01:43:13.612]  You're kidding!
[01:43:14.093 --> 01:43:16.894]  And the coke machine shoots out at you and it's a...
[01:43:18.155 --> 01:43:19.496]  It's audible in the middle ear.
[01:43:19.536 --> 01:43:20.517]  It's like a vibration.
[01:43:20.617 --> 01:43:21.859]  It's drink Coca-Cola.
[01:43:22.319 --> 01:43:25.562]  And I've been told this by a local executive of a computer company.
[01:43:25.582 --> 01:43:26.763]  I can't tell you who.
[01:43:27.264 --> 01:43:28.064]  I have confirmed it.
[01:43:28.105 --> 01:43:31.468]  It's one of the things where I pick up on it and then drop it and never have time to follow it up.
[01:43:31.988 --> 01:43:39.595]  Most shopping malls and most major department stores in the western world are broadcasting at right below recording level.
[01:43:39.635 --> 01:43:42.238]  That's so low that recorders don't really pick it up unless you're close.
[01:43:42.578 --> 01:43:43.279]  And it's recording.
[01:43:43.339 --> 01:43:44.139]  Don't steal.
[01:43:44.459 --> 01:43:45.140]  Do what's right.
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:46.280]  Purchase the product.
[01:43:46.721 --> 01:43:48.301]  And it's just a happy female voice.
[01:43:48.682 --> 01:43:49.562]  Thank you for coming.
[01:43:49.602 --> 01:43:50.543]  You're secure here.
[01:43:50.623 --> 01:43:51.303]  Isn't it nice?
[01:43:51.743 --> 01:43:53.304]  Wouldn't you like to make that purchase?
[01:43:54.165 --> 01:43:55.305]  But also, don't you steal.
[01:43:55.325 --> 01:43:56.206]  We're watching you.
[01:43:56.566 --> 01:43:57.407]  We're watching you.
[01:43:57.427 --> 01:44:01.129]  And look, they admit that back in the 40s they were doing it on radio.
[01:44:01.509 --> 01:44:06.372]  Movies in the 50s, they would just do a flash of, you're hungry, you're thirsty, drink Coca-Cola.
[01:44:06.392 --> 01:44:08.453]  I mean, this is taught in mainstream textbooks.
[01:44:08.953 --> 01:44:11.475]  You tell the average guy on the street, he's like, that's a lie!
[01:44:11.775 --> 01:44:16.422]  You know, it's just this is our world and we need to become aware of it, but go ahead and finish up what you were saying.
[01:44:18.085 --> 01:44:19.146]  Oh, myself, sir?
[01:44:19.307 --> 01:44:20.568]  Well, all I can see is this.
[01:44:20.608 --> 01:44:26.097]  Well, I wonder sometimes about some of these people who for years have been saying and hearing these voices in my head.
[01:44:26.681 --> 01:44:27.501]  I've been hearing these voices.
[01:44:27.802 --> 01:44:28.922]  Maybe some of it isn't.
[01:44:29.502 --> 01:44:30.023]  Exactly!
[01:44:30.063 --> 01:44:30.843]  No, that's the point.
[01:44:30.983 --> 01:44:36.986]  Is it, is it, the real stuff's going on, then you have crazy people, and then it makes more people who are borderline crazy really go nuts.
[01:44:37.366 --> 01:44:43.009]  Can you imagine being a, you know, one of these schizophrenics, turns on the TV and the, and all the talking heads are going, I want a chip!
[01:44:43.049 --> 01:44:43.729]  Our chip's good!
[01:44:43.949 --> 01:44:45.009]  Global government helps!
[01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:46.870]  Secret arrests and torture are good!
[01:44:46.890 --> 01:44:48.091]  You know what I mean?
[01:44:48.871 --> 01:44:54.634]  And if the low-level drugs in our water supply aren't sending them over the edge, something like this,
[01:44:55.327 --> 01:44:56.968]  Well, it certainly isn't helping.
[01:44:58.349 --> 01:44:58.829]  No, it isn't.
[01:44:58.869 --> 01:44:59.529]  Thank you, Andrew.
[01:44:59.749 --> 01:45:03.671]  Tom in Ohio, and that's it, because I've got to cover a few news items and talk about England with my guest.
[01:45:04.512 --> 01:45:05.392]  Hey, Alex, how are you?
[01:45:05.612 --> 01:45:06.113]  Good, sir.
[01:45:07.513 --> 01:45:11.695]  I'm calling to talk about an issue with vaccination.
[01:45:13.436 --> 01:45:21.380]  I'm a head of a veterans organization here in Ohio called the Unified Veterans Coalition, and I've been studying
[01:45:23.462 --> 01:45:27.323]  Squalene in the anthrax vaccines that have been given to our troops since the Gulf War.
[01:45:28.564 --> 01:45:35.446]  And I've been reading up on it and contacting Dr. Pamela Asa down at Tulane University.
[01:45:35.586 --> 01:45:46.030]  Well, according to the medical doctors we've interviewed, I mean, it's not really good for you, but compared to mercury and the viruses and the DNA fragments, it's kind of the least of my concerns.
[01:45:46.691 --> 01:45:50.352]  Well, one of the issues about it is the squalene is actually
[01:45:50.945 --> 01:45:58.509]  One of the adjuvants, like you mentioned, like the thimerosal and the mercury, only it causes autoimmune illnesses.
[01:45:58.529 --> 01:46:09.674]  So, you know, this goes along with that whole concept of keeping people in a lowered state or to where the drug companies could sell them drugs, perhaps.
[01:46:10.635 --> 01:46:13.176]  But this additive has been in vaccines
[01:46:14.712 --> 01:46:19.235]  Since the Gulf War, in different levels, they've been able to test it at different levels.
[01:46:19.335 --> 01:46:20.936]  It's not supposed to be in there, but it is.
[01:46:22.197 --> 01:46:26.320]  They've tested military personnel both before and after they've had the vaccines.
[01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:31.123]  And before they had the vaccines, they didn't have the antibodies, the squalene.
[01:46:31.743 --> 01:46:35.046]  After they did, and it seems simple enough.
[01:46:35.426 --> 01:46:37.667]  It's an oil and water emulsion.
[01:46:38.168 --> 01:46:42.951]  But this one in particular makes the body confuse it with its own oil.
[01:46:43.979 --> 01:46:48.582]  And so the body goes into like kind of a hyper state and attacks itself.
[01:46:49.343 --> 01:46:57.049]  And that's why a lot of Gulf War illnesses are very random and different because it depends on where it attacks.
[01:46:57.269 --> 01:46:58.129]  So it's an allergen.
[01:46:58.149 --> 01:46:58.850]  Thanks for the call.
[01:46:58.910 --> 01:46:59.490]  I appreciate it.
[01:47:00.071 --> 01:47:03.793]  I'm frustrated because we can take unlimited calls and we've got so much to talk about.
[01:47:04.334 --> 01:47:05.635]  Guys, let's talk about England.
[01:47:06.696 --> 01:47:10.598]  And then we'll get into
[01:47:13.032 --> 01:47:16.853]  We'll get into documents as Old Chiefs met with Cheney Task Force and a lot more.
[01:47:19.274 --> 01:47:30.578]  When we were in London, I mean, there were so many facets to it, but what was it like to have the police march up to you and tell you to turn your camera off when you were just on a public street interviewing people?
[01:47:31.899 --> 01:47:35.940]  Well, I mean, the fear-mongering at the time, we were there right after the bombings.
[01:47:37.161 --> 01:47:41.282]  Three weeks after the first bombings, I believe, but then there was the second failed attempt.
[01:47:41.923 --> 01:47:49.866]  So the state of panic was still quite high, even though Londoners basically were apathetic to the attack.
[01:47:50.686 --> 01:48:01.970]  They just got on with their lives, they weren't really buying the government propaganda on it, and in fact the government only had a small window of opportunity to exploit that attack because it soon lost its steam.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:23.302]  But what I noticed with the police going back, before I flew over to Texas, I went to London to stay the night, um, the armed police have been removed from the, uh, train stations, the one at King's Cross, which I passed through, so basically that fad's over, now the government have lost all steam in exploiting it, the attack, they've removed the, um,
[01:48:24.358 --> 01:48:26.559]  Now it's come out that they caught M.I.
[01:48:54.171 --> 01:49:10.339]  Six connected SAS Special Air Services dressed up like Arabs running around with plastic explosives in Basra shooting Iraqi police and we've caught Israelis doing the same things with these fake beards dressed up like Arabs.
[01:49:10.379 --> 01:49:11.100]  Comments on that?
[01:49:12.761 --> 01:49:19.544]  Yeah, you've got fake beards, you've got fake Muslim garb and you're driving around shooting at police.
[01:49:20.166 --> 01:49:21.867]  How can that not be suspicious?
[01:49:22.328 --> 01:49:27.572]  The reports about bombs in the car were kind of amorphous, but it does seem to make sense.
[01:49:27.732 --> 01:49:34.097]  Iran's saying that US and UK forces are behind a lot of these bombings, so the evidence is tending in that direction.
[01:49:34.117 --> 01:49:37.920]  I want to get your take on that when we get back, Steve, and talk a little bit about London.
[01:49:39.099 --> 01:49:47.381]  And some of the attitudes there, I would challenge some of the British people with real issues and they would just say, you've got a little bit of grass on your pants.
[01:49:47.401 --> 01:49:50.222]  Look at you, you dirty little man!
[01:49:53.442 --> 01:49:57.783]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:49:57.963 --> 01:50:02.425]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.525 --> 01:50:06.926]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:06.966 --> 01:50:08.286]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.066 --> 01:50:10.027]  Can emerge.
[01:50:10.087 --> 01:50:14.309]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.369 --> 01:50:21.312]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.432 --> 01:50:23.433]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:23.953 --> 01:50:34.221]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.441 --> 01:50:39.805]  If you want to understand what the new old order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:50:55.145 --> 01:51:05.849]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[01:51:22.735 --> 01:51:29.580]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.

[01:52:56.328 --> 01:53:01.031]  Steve, it just came out.
[01:53:02.693 --> 01:53:05.075]  We already had the presidential tapes with LBJ admitting it.
[01:53:05.115 --> 01:53:07.036]  We already had senior officers admitting it.
[01:53:07.056 --> 01:53:10.539]  But now the declassified documents have been released by the CIA.
[01:53:10.599 --> 01:53:12.041]  They staged the Gulf of Tonkin.
[01:53:12.341 --> 01:53:13.822]  They lied about it to lead us into war.
[01:53:13.842 --> 01:53:15.423]  So here's another example.
[01:53:15.463 --> 01:53:18.806]  Can you speak about the staging of the Gulf of Tonkin in 1964?
[01:53:21.118 --> 01:53:28.502]  Well, yeah, I mean, the latest thing we've got coming out is this, uh, GOP memo which states that terror attacks would be helpful.
[01:53:29.402 --> 01:53:32.664]  Um, before that we had the Project Northwoods documents.
[01:53:32.744 --> 01:53:36.526]  I mean, these things, these things keep coming out and we keep covering them.
[01:53:36.566 --> 01:53:38.367]  They're the same thing over and over again.
[01:53:38.967 --> 01:53:48.472]  Saying that staged terror is a possibility, uh, to be undertaken to forward their own agenda to gain centralization of power and more control.
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:53.701]  And these things come up again and again, and it's always the same figures that are involved.
[01:53:53.721 --> 01:53:55.722]  It goes straight to the top of the government.
[01:53:56.022 --> 01:54:01.243]  Going back to London, Tony Blair is only accelerating the level of legal and illegal immigrants that come in.
[01:54:01.603 --> 01:54:05.044]  They're given welfare, they're left alone, and it's selectively enforced.
[01:54:06.365 --> 01:54:09.226]  But then at the same time, they're saying, brace for terror attack any minute.
[01:54:09.246 --> 01:54:10.446]  Can you talk about that hypocrisy?
[01:54:11.937 --> 01:54:23.842]  Yeah, well the situation in London I think now has died down slightly because Tony Blair is now seen as a sort of lame duck Prime Minister in that he's possibly going to be out of there in a couple of months.
[01:54:24.943 --> 01:54:31.765]  But yeah, I mean, the issue of immigration was brought up a lot during the run-up to the general election.
[01:54:32.866 --> 01:54:35.187]  The Conservative Party basically took the stance of
[01:54:35.828 --> 01:54:42.738]  We need to cut down a lot on immigration, even legal immigration, because there's just too many coming in.
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:52.012]  Tony Blair took the stance of, well we have to look carefully at this and we have to analyse how many people are coming in.
[01:54:53.112 --> 01:55:03.555]  But, I mean, basically it's a non-issue between the two parties and the general election basically petered out and they both converged into saying basically the same thing about immigration.
[01:55:04.535 --> 01:55:08.936]  So they go, OK, we're hearing you in public, but then they just continue the old policy of letting all the illegals in.
[01:55:09.256 --> 01:55:17.178]  Yeah, I mean, it's almost as if the Tory party were playing off what Blair was saying and it all converged into one sort of mishmash.
[01:55:18.024 --> 01:55:20.205]  Well, it's always been that way, and it's only getting worse.
[01:55:20.225 --> 01:55:21.226]  What about torture?
[01:55:21.286 --> 01:55:34.352]  Stansfield Turner, who headed up the CIA in the early 1980s, has gone public and said the Vice President is the President for Torture, and he went on to say, I'm embarrassed the United States is a Vice President for Torture.
[01:55:34.432 --> 01:55:36.934]  Admiral Turner claims the CIA
[01:55:38.661 --> 01:55:41.382]  Prisons used for torture are known as black sites.
[01:55:41.442 --> 01:55:45.304]  Terrorist suspects are picked up in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan.
[01:55:45.665 --> 01:55:55.530]  They're flown by CIA-controlled private aircraft, which is totally criminal, to countries where they're tortured in secret interrogation sites operating outside any country's jurisdiction.
[01:55:56.070 --> 01:56:02.013]  And a high-level former Republican, number two at Treasury, editor for the Wall Street Journal, last week, we're about to re-air the interview,
[01:56:02.751 --> 01:56:16.751]  said that he's ashamed of this and that you don't get good data from torture, you can't trust a government that tortures, that they're torturing just to get people to then say they're terrorists to create this false image of thousands of terrorists that don't even exist!
[01:56:17.853 --> 01:56:24.277]  Yeah, um, Robert's made the point that, what is it, nine, only nine at Guantanamo Bay have been charged and none have been convicted.
[01:56:24.657 --> 01:56:30.621]  We're supposed to believe that there are these terrorist cells running around our back gardens planning things and the evidence just isn't there.
[01:56:31.102 --> 01:56:34.304]  Same in Uzbekistan with Craig Murray, the British ambassador.
[01:56:35.024 --> 01:56:45.548]  Um, he went over there to assess whether they were using torture, found convincing evidence that they were, he came back, told the British Government, they said, we don't care, we're still going to use the information anyway.
[01:56:45.868 --> 01:56:55.751]  And in that country they were, in effect, creating the myth that these Al-Qaeda groups existed, because all the people were self-implicating themselves under duress of torture, which is what Robert stated.
[01:56:55.891 --> 01:56:59.833]  But I thought that Joseph Mengele, the Nazi doctor, was bad because he tortured.
[01:56:59.853 --> 01:57:02.193]  I thought Saddam was bad because he allegedly tortured.
[01:57:02.674 --> 01:57:08.216]  But now in the supposed prisons where the torture went on, our government has admittedly set up rape rooms.
[01:57:08.816 --> 01:57:13.918]  Bush says we don't torture, but then they don't need to ban the torture that doesn't exist anyway.
[01:57:13.938 --> 01:57:14.918]  It's a complete double thing.
[01:57:14.958 --> 01:57:18.240]  He says, I'm going to block the Senate banning torture, but I'm against torture.
[01:57:18.500 --> 01:57:20.201]  And Dick Cheney says, well, we need to keep torturing.
[01:57:20.701 --> 01:57:23.802]  But then they'll send people to prison who follow their orders to torture.
[01:57:25.254 --> 01:57:28.678]  Yeah, how many Al-Qaeda leaders have been discovered at Guantanamo Bay?
[01:57:29.238 --> 01:57:30.480]  Absolutely zero!
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:31.881]  Third hour coming up!

[01:57:49.452 --> 01:57:50.093]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.753 --> 01:57:51.814]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.534 --> 01:57:53.675]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.295 --> 01:57:55.116]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.856 --> 01:57:56.777]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:56.797 --> 01:58:01.360]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:05.743]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.646 --> 01:58:13.648]  Paul Craig Roberts coming up on this live Friday edition.
[01:58:14.128 --> 01:58:15.329]  It is the 18th of November, 2005.
[01:58:15.369 --> 01:58:17.770]  Paul Watson and Steve Watson in studio.
[01:58:18.150 --> 01:58:18.831]  Five more minutes.
[01:58:19.483 --> 01:58:19.883]  Left here.
[01:58:20.964 --> 01:58:39.580]  While we were in London, and this film's upcoming in a few months, while we were there, we had case after case where we'd be out on the street doing interviews with people, and we'd be showing the video cameras, and there were people working right there at the Hard Rock Cafe, and I'm like, look at these cameras!
[01:58:39.600 --> 01:58:40.201]  They're everywhere!
[01:58:40.241 --> 01:58:41.082]  They're in plain view!
[01:58:41.122 --> 01:58:43.944]  And the manager comes out and goes, you know, thanks for showing me that!
[01:58:43.984 --> 01:58:44.985]  I've never noticed those!
[01:58:45.822 --> 01:58:54.088]  He goes, yeah it's kind of Big Brother, but then he engaged in Doublethink right there, he goes, well I don't care, I say they don't exist, and if they don't exist, in my mind they don't exist.
[01:58:54.128 --> 01:58:56.670]  I mean, that was actual Doublethink.
[01:58:56.710 --> 01:58:58.031]  Steve, Paul, you want to comment on that?
[01:58:59.172 --> 01:59:03.115]  Well, let me read a quote from Orwell, from 1984.
[01:59:03.275 --> 01:59:08.259]  Doublethink is an unending series of victories over your own memory, reality, control.
[01:59:08.920 --> 01:59:14.484]  To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies,
[01:59:15.086 --> 01:59:26.394]  To hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out knowing them to be completely contradictory and believing in both of them to use logic against logic to repudiate morality while laying claim to it.
[01:59:26.955 --> 01:59:30.037]  And this is exactly what we saw over and over again in London.
[01:59:31.438 --> 01:59:35.821]  We basically walked out of the hotel as a massive pole of cameras in front of us.
[01:59:36.422 --> 01:59:41.726]  So we interviewed the nearest person who happens to be the manager of the Hard Rock Cafe next to it.
[01:59:41.746 --> 01:59:43.367]  He says, oh, I've never seen them before but
[01:59:44.153 --> 01:59:49.514]  You know, they're there to protect us, basically, but I choose to believe that they don't exist.
[01:59:50.555 --> 01:59:58.457]  But you wrote an article where over and over and over again, what about the woman that said, I'm for torture, it keeps us safe.
[01:59:59.217 --> 02:00:02.258]  Well, no, she said... Take my freedom for my liberty, yeah.
[02:00:02.578 --> 02:00:06.239]  Yeah, she said she wanted to give up liberty for freedom.
[02:00:07.176 --> 02:00:09.297]  Which is just completely contradictory.
[02:00:09.317 --> 02:00:10.298]  Well, set that up for people.
[02:00:10.378 --> 02:00:13.520]  We're right outside the place where now it turns out they shot him, what, 14 times?
[02:00:14.581 --> 02:00:15.321]  Tell folks about that.
[02:00:16.041 --> 02:00:19.964]  Yeah, well, we went to Stockwell Tube Station where they shot the Brazilian man.
[02:00:20.764 --> 02:00:22.065]  I think it was, how many times was it?
[02:00:22.205 --> 02:00:22.445]  Eight?
[02:00:22.846 --> 02:00:23.846]  They shot him eight times.
[02:00:23.866 --> 02:00:25.467]  The number grew even more after that.
[02:00:25.547 --> 02:00:25.927]  It's more.
[02:00:26.328 --> 02:00:27.388]  Well, it's enough anyway.
[02:00:28.769 --> 02:00:33.072]  And, yeah, we basically noticed this woman who was working on the fruit store.
[02:00:33.112 --> 02:00:34.773]  She'd been interviewed on the BBC.
[02:00:34.813 --> 02:00:35.553]  I'd seen her on there.
[02:00:35.573 --> 02:00:36.774]  So we went over to interview her.
[02:00:37.825 --> 02:00:42.486]  Um, we were talking to her, and Alex asked her if she would sacrifice liberty for security.
[02:00:43.446 --> 02:00:46.747]  And she came back with, yes, I'll sacrifice liberty for freedom.
[02:00:47.707 --> 02:00:49.307]  Liberty and freedom are the same thing.
[02:00:49.987 --> 02:00:54.228]  We then asked her again, to clarify, just in case she made a mistake, and she said the same thing again.
[02:00:54.728 --> 02:00:56.628]  She was willing to give up liberty for freedom.
[02:00:57.269 --> 02:01:01.649]  Which is, really, it's a direct double think, because the two things mean the same thing.
[02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:05.150]  And there were examples after examples of that, weren't there, Paul?
[02:01:06.917 --> 02:01:13.340]  Yeah, I mean, you've got, you've got a nest of, what, six or seven cameras and people are out there saying they've never noticed them.
[02:01:13.941 --> 02:01:21.425]  It's like, it's a survival mechanism to deny reality, but at the end of the day, it's not even a survival mechanism, it's quite dangerous.
[02:01:22.085 --> 02:01:28.948]  Um, we were asking the attitudes of taxi drivers about the bombings, they were all quite ambiguous, they kind of believed the government lied at that point.
[02:01:29.489 --> 02:01:35.852]  I think it's flipped around now, just a few months later, it's taken a very short amount of time for people to really question what actually happened.
[02:01:36.511 --> 02:01:44.099]  Especially with the laundry list of evidence that it was an inside job, it was a staged event, which we've got on the website in the London Bombings Archive.
[02:01:44.519 --> 02:01:50.866]  So the attitudes immediately after were quite guarded and they towed along with the government line.
[02:01:51.346 --> 02:01:55.070]  But now I think it's flipped round to where people are really questioning the bombings and
[02:01:55.550 --> 02:02:01.433]  You know, Blair's approval rating's going down just as Bush's is, so we're starting to see the tide turning again, that typically.
[02:02:01.453 --> 02:02:08.396]  Well, especially when it turned out a SWAT was this MI6 guy being protected, and he's the supposed master of the bombers.
[02:02:09.297 --> 02:02:10.777]  Yeah, and then the bomb site evidence.
[02:02:10.797 --> 02:02:16.200]  You've got two separate credible people at two separate incident sites saying the bombs came up from below the train.
[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:18.481]  No evidence of suicide bombers.
[02:02:19.021 --> 02:02:21.342]  You've got the manipulation of the markets before the attack.
[02:02:21.362 --> 02:02:22.923]  You've got public officials being warned.
[02:02:22.963 --> 02:02:23.743]  Same damn line.
[02:02:23.784 --> 02:02:24.624]  It was an inside job.
[02:02:25.928 --> 02:02:26.489]  Absolutely.
[02:02:26.529 --> 02:02:28.450]  Hey, it was fun having you guys here in the U.S.
[02:02:28.490 --> 02:02:32.374]  and we'll have you back on the radio via telephone in the near future.
[02:02:32.414 --> 02:02:34.736]  Gentlemen, you want to say bye to America?
[02:02:35.396 --> 02:02:36.277]  Goodbye, Texas.
[02:02:37.318 --> 02:02:38.619]  Thanks for having us, Texas.
[02:02:39.612 --> 02:02:40.052]  America.
[02:02:40.352 --> 02:02:40.772]  You bet.
[02:02:40.792 --> 02:02:44.674]  Alright folks, Paul Gregg Roberts, Dr. Roberts coming up.
[02:02:46.334 --> 02:02:49.195]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:02:49.435 --> 02:02:51.035]  Hello my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:51.375 --> 02:02:56.057]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[02:02:56.377 --> 02:03:00.778]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:03:01.218 --> 02:03:05.420]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has arisen.
[02:03:05.620 --> 02:03:08.461]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:03:08.561 --> 02:03:13.223]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:03:13.444 --> 02:03:17.826]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:03:18.086 --> 02:03:25.269]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:03:25.549 --> 02:03:27.990]  Discover the documentary for yourself before it's too late.

[02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:48.691]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:03:48.752 --> 02:03:52.933]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:03:53.193 --> 02:03:55.975]  But, if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:03:56.155 --> 02:03:58.576]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:03:58.756 --> 02:04:07.399]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:04:07.580 --> 02:04:08.940]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:13.302]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[02:04:13.562 --> 02:04:14.263]  Not yet available?
[02:04:45.763 --> 02:04:52.124]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:04:52.344 --> 02:04:57.366]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:04:57.686 --> 02:05:05.588]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:05:05.728 --> 02:05:12.770]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:05:12.990 --> 02:05:14.212]  There are no side effects.
[02:05:14.372 --> 02:05:17.756]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:05:17.816 --> 02:05:18.937]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:05:19.217 --> 02:05:20.499]  Eliminate the cause.
[02:05:20.699 --> 02:05:27.527]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.

[02:05:33.272 --> 02:05:34.233]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:05:50.381 --> 02:05:51.042]  Big Brother.
[02:05:51.682 --> 02:05:52.763]  Mainstream media.
[02:05:53.464 --> 02:05:54.584]  Government cover-ups.
[02:05:55.225 --> 02:05:56.045]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.786 --> 02:05:57.886]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:58.347 --> 02:06:02.309]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.530 --> 02:06:06.672]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.953 --> 02:06:12.156]  You know, I'm sorry!
[02:06:12.276 --> 02:06:22.459]  I'm sorry that we didn't get to any of your calls for the last guest, Dr. Stephen E. Jones, but he just kept bringing up so many important points that we were unable to.
[02:06:22.499 --> 02:06:32.141]  But I will get to the folks that are holding later in this hour with our next guest, who we're extremely honored to have on with us, and he's Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:06:32.381 --> 02:06:35.242]  Let me just read the short bio on Dr. Roberts.
[02:06:37.302 --> 02:06:40.303]  He's a John M. Oland Fellow at the Institute for
[02:06:43.837 --> 02:06:53.562]  He is a former associate editor of the Wall Street Journal, former contributing editor for National Review, a former assistant secretary of the U.S.
[02:06:53.622 --> 02:06:54.083]  Treasury.
[02:06:54.123 --> 02:06:56.604]  He is the co-author of the Tyranny of Good Intentions.
[02:06:58.065 --> 02:06:59.826]  And I just had him on during the break.
[02:06:59.866 --> 02:07:00.506]  I was talking to him.
[02:07:00.546 --> 02:07:03.148]  I said, Dr. Roberts, what do you want to talk about?
[02:07:04.685 --> 02:07:06.385]  And he brought up something that's in my list.
[02:07:06.445 --> 02:07:12.367]  You know, when I call Dr. Roberts or Ron Paul or any of these great men, I don't, you know, pre-screen what we're going to talk about.
[02:07:12.427 --> 02:07:13.187]  I just have them on.
[02:07:13.227 --> 02:07:14.867]  We talk about whatever they think is important.
[02:07:14.887 --> 02:07:23.009]  And it was right when I opened the show with the day, this open acceptance of torture and the schizophrenia of what they're doing, putting people in prison.
[02:07:23.029 --> 02:07:26.929]  But then the White House says that we're going to veto laws barring torture.
[02:07:27.870 --> 02:07:32.471]  And Gonzales writes memos saying we can torture people to death if we don't call it torture.
[02:07:32.751 --> 02:07:34.391]  But none of them get impeached or go to prison.
[02:07:35.559 --> 02:07:40.084]  And then we found out about all these secret gulags that we reported on three years ago.
[02:07:40.104 --> 02:07:42.687]  This is nothing new, nothing secret about them.
[02:07:42.707 --> 02:07:44.609]  We know right where they're at.
[02:07:45.349 --> 02:07:47.812]  Admittedly, it was in the Washington Post in early 2002.
[02:07:47.852 --> 02:07:55.200]  They had the CIA section chief bragging that, oh yeah, we pressure them and torture them in different countries, Jordan and in
[02:07:56.252 --> 02:07:59.754]  Egypt, and it said we even do stuff for their kids in front of them.
[02:08:00.034 --> 02:08:01.515]  Never forget that in the Washington Post.
[02:08:02.096 --> 02:08:04.937]  I put that in my film, The Road to Tyranny, three years ago.
[02:08:05.018 --> 02:08:05.398]  Here it is.
[02:08:05.438 --> 02:08:07.299]  They say they do stuff for their children in front of them.
[02:08:07.699 --> 02:08:09.700]  And boy, we learned they do do that at Abu Ghraib.
[02:08:09.740 --> 02:08:13.463]  We had General Janice Karpinski on a few weeks ago.
[02:08:13.483 --> 02:08:18.766]  They tried to blame them with stuff, but she wasn't even allowed into these CIA-controlled wings.
[02:08:19.206 --> 02:08:20.447]  And now that's what Cheney says.
[02:08:20.487 --> 02:08:21.808]  He says, I don't
[02:08:22.845 --> 02:08:24.066]  Want the Army to be able to torture?
[02:08:24.106 --> 02:08:25.106]  Okay, I'll compromise.
[02:08:25.166 --> 02:08:26.147]  Just the CIA?
[02:08:26.167 --> 02:08:27.067]  Well, that's who does it!
[02:08:28.628 --> 02:08:36.112]  So you understand, when you're for this torture, folks, you're for these big, fat, disgusting demons cornering little children.
[02:08:36.973 --> 02:08:42.476]  And I just can't believe... I mean, even the Nazis didn't brag about their torture on the radio or in the newspapers.
[02:08:42.516 --> 02:08:48.779]  I mean, we're the first ever, I guess since ancient times, to openly say that we do all of this.
[02:08:48.879 --> 02:08:50.280]  And, I mean, God help us.
[02:08:51.093 --> 02:08:53.835]  I mean, this is just unbelievable, but I've said enough.
[02:08:54.276 --> 02:09:04.884]  He's here to talk about that, talk about the police state, all the setups for martial law we see taking place, and he's got real conservative credentials, and he's Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:09:04.924 --> 02:09:06.265]  Thank you for coming on with us today, sir.
[02:09:06.665 --> 02:09:07.886]  Hey, glad to be with you, Alex.
[02:09:08.536 --> 02:09:21.724]  What do you think of the statements I just made about how we're against torture, but we're going to ban the Senate, we're going to veto the Senate saying you can't torture, and Gonzales says we can kill people, but that isn't torture, because we just changed the name, and yeah, we got secret camps, so what?
[02:09:22.665 --> 02:09:27.708]  I think that the United States government is in the hands of psychopaths.
[02:09:27.948 --> 02:09:30.290]  I mean, these are insane, dangerous people.
[02:09:31.830 --> 02:09:33.752]  They're a disgrace to the human race.
[02:09:33.872 --> 02:09:35.793]  They're certainly a disgrace to every American.
[02:09:37.294 --> 02:09:40.937]  These people have somehow got to be rounded up and held accountable.
[02:09:41.037 --> 02:09:43.539]  Every one of them, as far as I'm concerned, is a war criminal.
[02:09:43.559 --> 02:09:48.923]  They should be turned over to the court at the Hague.
[02:09:48.943 --> 02:09:53.387]  I don't think we've seen an administration this evil in my lifetime.
[02:09:53.487 --> 02:09:54.908]  I include Stalin and Hitler.
[02:09:56.495 --> 02:10:01.138]  Well, they certainly have those grand designs, and I'm trying to understand this, Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:10:01.158 --> 02:10:02.979]  Very strong words from you, but it's true.
[02:10:02.999 --> 02:10:10.463]  Even Ron Paul, a month ago, without me prompting, said they may declare martial law, they may take our guns, we may all get arrested.
[02:10:10.483 --> 02:10:12.984]  The question is, Alex, what the hell are they up to?
[02:10:14.064 --> 02:10:15.605]  Let's just start with something simple.
[02:10:15.725 --> 02:10:17.086]  Why do they want to torture?
[02:10:19.027 --> 02:10:24.630]  It's well known, has been known forever, and all the intelligence services know it.
[02:10:25.225 --> 02:10:27.826]  That when you torture people, you get bad information.
[02:10:28.346 --> 02:10:30.466]  They tell you stuff just to stop hurting.
[02:10:30.826 --> 02:10:31.887]  They'll make up anything.
[02:10:31.927 --> 02:10:33.367]  They'll tell you what you want to hear.
[02:10:33.567 --> 02:10:35.087]  They want more false intelligence.
[02:10:35.428 --> 02:10:39.088]  Well, it doesn't do them any good.
[02:10:39.609 --> 02:10:45.070]  So the real question is, why do they want to torture people when it doesn't produce good information?
[02:10:47.049 --> 02:10:58.660]  Could it possibly be that they need a whole bunch of terrorists who implicate themselves so they can prove there actually is a terrorist threat?
[02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:02.583]  So they go round up... See, another thing, Alex, they know.
[02:11:02.603 --> 02:11:09.550]  Our army knows, our government knows, the CIA knows, all these people they have in detention
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:14.983]  The likelihood of any of them being a terrorist is extremely low.
[02:11:15.604 --> 02:11:21.989]  Most of these people, Alex, were rounded up in the equivalent of KGB, Stalin-era street sweeps.
[02:11:22.649 --> 02:11:25.992]  They just happened to be there when troops came along and grabbed them.
[02:11:26.092 --> 02:11:33.318]  Many of them, and it's been in the news, they have lawyers, many of them were people captured
[02:11:34.922 --> 02:11:38.344]  In Pakistan by Pakistani gangsters.
[02:11:38.944 --> 02:11:39.505]  And sold.
[02:11:39.645 --> 02:11:42.226]  And sold to the Americans as terrorists.
[02:11:42.466 --> 02:12:01.416]  Well actually what the army admitted and the head CIA officer in Afghanistan for two years said is that they would get between five and twenty five thousand dollars per man woman or child and they would just go into little mountain villages of people that never had left their village who didn't even know where America was on a map.
[02:12:01.436 --> 02:12:02.137]  This is admitted
[02:12:02.857 --> 02:12:07.599]  And it was actual Taliban who would actually then come sell these innocent people.
[02:12:07.659 --> 02:12:15.182]  And the Army's own report said 75 to 90 percent of those were completely innocent of even ever picking up arms against us.
[02:12:15.482 --> 02:12:18.163]  And they were just children and families that didn't have papers in order.
[02:12:18.303 --> 02:12:29.928]  Yeah, and Arab businessmen who happened to... Anybody who's not protected were picked up by the warlords and the gangs and sold to the dumb shit Americans.
[02:12:31.434 --> 02:12:36.616]  And so the people who are in these prisons are totally innocent people.
[02:12:36.776 --> 02:12:39.737]  I bet you they haven't got five terrorists in the whole bunch.
[02:12:40.838 --> 02:12:41.578]  And they know that.
[02:12:42.479 --> 02:12:48.101]  But you see, they can't admit that they've made any kind of mistake or done anything that's stupid.
[02:12:49.261 --> 02:12:50.702]  And they can't admit that
[02:12:51.164 --> 02:12:54.206]  They don't really know where the terrorists are, and they haven't caught any.
[02:12:54.446 --> 02:13:01.109]  But how do we get to the point of raping women and children in front of their husbands and fathers?
[02:13:01.609 --> 02:13:04.251]  Well, obviously, the military is out of control.
[02:13:05.131 --> 02:13:06.832]  It has no honor, no integrity.
[02:13:08.253 --> 02:13:09.493]  No one is held accountable.
[02:13:10.694 --> 02:13:14.696]  I mean, you know, it's worse than the Waffen SS, if you want to know the truth.
[02:13:16.317 --> 02:13:20.099]  All this stuff about support the troops, support the troops, it doesn't make any sense.
[02:13:21.810 --> 02:13:30.273]  Look, there's something in the Guardian yesterday, and they call it a name that lives in infamy.
[02:13:30.794 --> 02:13:33.775]  This is in the Guardian, which is that big paper in Britain.
[02:13:36.516 --> 02:13:41.037]  And it's about the American barbarism in Iraq.
[02:13:42.318 --> 02:13:45.019]  And of course, we're the name that lives in infamy.
[02:13:47.179 --> 02:13:55.505]  So, you know, we are becoming the most hated nation on the face of the earth.
[02:13:55.625 --> 02:14:03.090]  Well, I had Wayne Madison, who was, as you know, a NSA analyst, and he said working for Reagan back in the
[02:14:04.151 --> 02:14:20.564]  Back in the 80s, as you did, he said if they saw this type of stuff, if they saw an administration doing this in the 80s, they would have thought it's a fifth column, it's communist, they're doing this to make America look bad, they're doing this to bring America down, they're doing this to destroy all of our international connections.
[02:14:21.185 --> 02:14:23.627]  And I said, well, Wayne, isn't that what's happening?
[02:14:23.647 --> 02:14:31.333]  And he said, you know, yeah, it's a corporate interest that just is strip mining and insanely just in a bloody orgy of feeding.
[02:14:33.058 --> 02:14:37.843]  Well, I think it's the insane neoconservatives.
[02:14:37.863 --> 02:14:42.027]  They deceived the nation.
[02:14:42.967 --> 02:14:44.389]  They committed high treason.
[02:14:44.549 --> 02:14:47.592]  They led us into war on lies.
[02:14:48.773 --> 02:14:50.154]  It's not working for them.
[02:14:50.895 --> 02:14:57.261]  They have to produce the image of massive numbers of terrorists to keep
[02:14:58.053 --> 02:15:02.875]  Enough Americans on their side who are fearful, and oh, the terrorists are going to get us.
[02:15:02.915 --> 02:15:05.957]  See, they've got 750 terrorists at Guantanamo.
[02:15:06.397 --> 02:15:09.258]  They haven't got seven terrorists at Guantanamo.
[02:15:10.038 --> 02:15:14.060]  Why do you need to hold terrorists for three years without bringing charges?
[02:15:15.021 --> 02:15:18.042]  If you know they're terrorists, it's very easy to bring charges.
[02:15:18.182 --> 02:15:19.843]  It's actually almost four now, sir.
[02:15:19.983 --> 02:15:21.563]  Yeah, well, four, however long.
[02:15:22.244 --> 02:15:22.624]  I think
[02:15:23.237 --> 02:15:29.484]  I think I saw just the other day, Alex, that we've actually brought nine people to trial.
[02:15:30.004 --> 02:15:31.025]  No one's been convicted?
[02:15:31.206 --> 02:15:32.307]  And no one's been convicted.
[02:15:32.367 --> 02:15:33.308]  But we've brought nine.
[02:15:33.788 --> 02:15:37.512]  So where are these terrorists?
[02:15:37.893 --> 02:15:41.617]  If we know they're terrorists, why do we have to hold them for four years?
[02:15:43.458 --> 02:15:55.205]  Well, how come we don't listen when the lawyers representing their families say, you've got my husband and my father and he's a Saudi businessman and he was captured in Pakistan and sold to you guys?
[02:15:57.467 --> 02:16:02.310]  And then the army interrogators even go, look, these people are totally innocent and they get told, keep them.
[02:16:02.590 --> 02:16:03.390]  We're not letting them go.
[02:16:03.590 --> 02:16:04.251]  That's on record.
[02:16:04.671 --> 02:16:07.553]  Yeah, because we have to have, see,
[02:16:08.828 --> 02:16:10.969]  All of this is bogus proof.
[02:16:11.389 --> 02:16:15.211]  Well, they also fired Brigadier General Rick Boggess, who refused to torture.
[02:16:15.251 --> 02:16:16.371]  He said, I will not do this.
[02:16:17.272 --> 02:16:17.952]  I will resign.
[02:16:17.972 --> 02:16:19.613]  They said, no, you don't need to resign.
[02:16:19.653 --> 02:16:20.353]  You're fired.
[02:16:21.413 --> 02:16:25.755]  As I mentioned, Janice Karpinski, the general, she wasn't even allowed into these areas.
[02:16:25.775 --> 02:16:30.997]  She complained, so they tried to blame it on her, but they admitted that the Army wouldn't torture.
[02:16:31.017 --> 02:16:31.797]  They'd beat people up.
[02:16:31.817 --> 02:16:32.858]  They said, we're not going to do it anymore.
[02:16:33.118 --> 02:16:37.960]  So they actually hired prison guards from federal prisons with bad records of abuse
[02:16:38.360 --> 02:16:40.824]  Who like to rape little kids and send them in!
[02:16:40.884 --> 02:16:42.186]  I mean, it's unbelievable!
[02:16:42.527 --> 02:16:44.329]  I know, and the whole question is why?
[02:16:45.151 --> 02:16:46.092]  What does it achieve?
[02:16:46.152 --> 02:16:46.493]  It doesn't...
[02:16:47.841 --> 02:16:49.342]  I'm not denying what you say.
[02:16:49.422 --> 02:16:50.963]  I'm just saying it's pointless.
[02:16:51.063 --> 02:16:51.924]  What does it achieve?
[02:16:52.004 --> 02:16:56.586]  It doesn't achieve anything except the bad name for all Americans.
[02:16:56.746 --> 02:17:01.109]  It creates terror, as Lennon said, and it creates cadres, it creates torture teams.
[02:17:01.469 --> 02:17:03.150]  That's what General Lukerpinski agreed with me.
[02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:07.653]  She said they have created cadres of torture teams and then trained larger torture teams, sir.
[02:17:08.033 --> 02:17:09.454]  Oh, you mean they're going to turn them loose on us?
[02:17:09.774 --> 02:17:10.254]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:10.534 --> 02:17:10.734]  Yeah.
[02:17:11.315 --> 02:17:16.758]  Well, that may well be what they have in mind, but they certainly aren't
[02:17:18.588 --> 02:17:25.794]  Achieving any goal in Iraq except more casualties for Americans by making them hate us ever more.
[02:17:26.134 --> 02:17:26.674]  Unbelievable.
[02:17:26.714 --> 02:17:29.677]  Sir, give us some more of your views on this when we get back.
[02:17:29.717 --> 02:17:34.360]  Any other subjects you'd like to discuss, it's always very interesting to have Dr. Paul Craig Roberts on with us.
[02:17:34.941 --> 02:17:36.282]  I think I might have an answer.
[02:17:36.302 --> 02:17:40.105]  We'll see what the doctor thinks about my answer to another reason they might do it.
[02:17:40.485 --> 02:17:41.906]  See, Rumsfeld told us why.
[02:17:45.128 --> 02:17:47.050]  Welcome to RealityZone.com.
[02:17:47.702 --> 02:17:49.103]  My name is G. Edward Griffin.
[02:17:50.003 --> 02:18:00.510]  When I wrote The Creature from Jekyll Island, a second look at the Federal Reserve, I said, we must create an entirely new money supply which is 100% backed by precious metals.
[02:18:01.090 --> 02:18:03.612]  And we must do this within a reasonably short period of time.
[02:18:04.512 --> 02:18:09.075]  I'm now pleased to inform you that the Liberty Dollar Organization has done precisely that.
[02:18:09.682 --> 02:18:14.383]  The Liberty Dollar is 100% backed and redeemable in gold and silver.
[02:18:14.923 --> 02:18:33.549]  So, if you want to make money and protect your purchasing power, I encourage you to visit the Liberty Dollar at www.LibertyDollar.org or call 888-421-6181 to find out about getting a free copy of The Creature from Jekyll Island.

[02:18:45.678 --> 02:18:47.279]  Government is best which governs least.
[02:18:47.840 --> 02:18:49.140]  Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:18:49.581 --> 02:18:52.263]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:18:52.743 --> 02:18:55.385]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:18:55.825 --> 02:19:02.309]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:19:23.145 --> 02:19:24.566]  I never voted for a war criminal.
[02:19:24.746 --> 02:19:25.106]  Have you?
[02:19:25.686 --> 02:19:27.188]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:19:27.628 --> 02:19:29.149]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[02:19:29.189 --> 02:19:30.670]  If only our president would listen to his God.
[02:19:35.834 --> 02:19:36.875]  Perhaps Jenna Bush?
[02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:38.655]  Osama bin Ferdinand?

[02:19:45.158 --> 02:19:48.140]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:57.324]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments, like a local or national emergency.
[02:19:57.644 --> 02:20:02.306]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:20:02.786 --> 02:20:09.509]  The Berkelot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:20:09.909 --> 02:20:21.694]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:22.174 --> 02:20:26.617]  The Murky Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:20:29.279 --> 02:20:31.100]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:32.321]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:20:32.381 --> 02:20:33.862]  Or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[02:20:33.882 --> 02:20:34.923]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:44.321 --> 02:20:45.301]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[02:20:45.401 --> 02:20:50.162]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve Note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[02:20:50.342 --> 02:20:58.144]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[02:20:58.404 --> 02:21:03.765]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[02:21:03.965 --> 02:21:10.947]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[02:21:11.247 --> 02:21:16.589]  A current effort is underway by the Fed, along with other central banks, to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:21:16.849 --> 02:21:21.570]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion in productivity can cause inflation.
[02:21:21.931 --> 02:21:29.513]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:21:29.853 --> 02:21:36.116]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:21:36.416 --> 02:21:37.617]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:37.677 --> 02:21:37.877]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:37.897 --> 02:21:38.497]  Alright, I'm frothing.
[02:21:55.050 --> 02:21:56.232]  But we should all be upset.
[02:21:56.272 --> 02:21:56.892]  We should all be.
[02:21:56.933 --> 02:21:58.915]  I mean, I had Ron Paul on.
[02:21:58.935 --> 02:21:59.776]  He's never talked like this.
[02:21:59.796 --> 02:22:05.102]  And he said, they may declare martial law, take our guns, and set up a dictatorship and start arresting us.
[02:22:05.122 --> 02:22:07.205]  I mean, that's Ron Paul, folks.
[02:22:07.865 --> 02:22:10.909]  A Vietnam veteran, congressman, most conservative voting record.
[02:22:12.861 --> 02:22:14.182]  This stuff's really happening!
[02:22:14.242 --> 02:22:15.443]  They really are doing this!
[02:22:16.064 --> 02:22:28.456]  But right before the Gulf War, in late 2002, they got a $6 billion federal program, a secret program funded, it was in UPI and the AP and a few other places, called P2OG.
[02:22:28.756 --> 02:22:30.338]  And I don't know if Dr. Roberts is aware of this,
[02:22:31.258 --> 02:22:34.440]  But MP2OG, they said, we're going to kill people's family members.
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:35.721]  We're going to attack Arabs.
[02:22:36.061 --> 02:22:42.105]  We're going to stimulate an attack in the Middle East, widen it, and then we can go into Iran and Syria and other areas.
[02:22:42.466 --> 02:23:00.558]  So, the plan is, you know, when they tell our troops to go in and you get shot at in a village, arrest every man down to age 11, bulldoze all their date palms, all their tangerine orchards, that is meant to generate, because do the corporations make more money if we're in Iraq a year and fix the problems and leave, or if we're there 10 years, 20 years,
[02:23:01.458 --> 02:23:03.999]  Dr. Roberts, does that now make sense to you or do you disagree?
[02:23:05.340 --> 02:23:10.402]  You know Alex, I don't know what to make of it all.
[02:23:11.203 --> 02:23:20.907]  I do agree with you that terrible things are going on and they make so little sense that almost any explanation becomes believable.
[02:23:21.761 --> 02:23:28.645]  But it's not, you know, all I can say about it is that I know that we are committing war crimes.
[02:23:28.705 --> 02:23:35.069]  We're in violation of the Nuremberg standard that we established when we put the Nazis on trial.
[02:23:35.189 --> 02:23:36.229]  What about federal law?
[02:23:36.809 --> 02:23:39.671]  We're in violation of everything.
[02:23:39.891 --> 02:23:40.111]  Yeah.
[02:23:40.772 --> 02:23:42.993]  But anyway, and why are they doing it?
[02:23:43.013 --> 02:23:48.336]  And why the, you know, there's something wrong with the public and that it sits there like
[02:23:49.159 --> 02:23:49.500]  Idiots!
[02:23:50.421 --> 02:23:53.164]  And that's a bunch of Nazis running wild.
[02:23:53.704 --> 02:24:10.403]  But let me go back to... Let's talk about... Let's contrast the Senate's vote to restrict detainees' access to the courts with what happened just the other day in the British Parliament.
[02:24:11.860 --> 02:24:19.561]  Now, in the great United States, we hold ourselves up as this great democracy and liberty and freedom and liberty and freedom.
[02:24:19.801 --> 02:24:20.822]  Bush goes on about it.
[02:24:21.522 --> 02:24:41.105]  The Senate yesterday endorsed a plan, I'm reading from the Washington Post today, that would overturn the landmark Supreme Court ruling last year that permitted many of the detainees held at Guantanamo Bay
[02:24:41.900 --> 02:24:43.420]  To challenge their detention.
[02:24:45.481 --> 02:24:53.443]  So, the Senate says, gosh, here's the Supreme Court is going to enforce the Constitution and let people have rights.
[02:24:53.543 --> 02:24:54.723]  We can't allow that!
[02:24:56.684 --> 02:25:06.886]  And you had that Republican from South Carolina, Lindsey Graham, leading the charge to overturn the Supreme Court's upholding of the U.S.
[02:25:06.946 --> 02:25:07.706]  Constitution.
[02:25:08.547 --> 02:25:10.087]  And then they voted yesterday
[02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:22.910]  49 to 42 to pass this law to overturn the Supreme Court decision that upholds the Constitution.
[02:25:22.930 --> 02:25:29.016]  So here they are, the Senate, United States Senate, voting to deep six the U.S.
[02:25:29.076 --> 02:25:29.837]  Constitution.
[02:25:30.757 --> 02:25:36.723]  And no doubt Bush will describe this as a great victory for freedom and democracy and liberty and blah blah blah.
[02:25:37.304 --> 02:25:42.088]  Now what happened in England at the same time, on Wednesday, what happened the day before?
[02:25:44.390 --> 02:25:59.924]  Bush's pimp over there, Blair, Tony Blair, somebody who is as despicable as Bush, he said, oh look, we want rights to hold the detainees for 90 days.
[02:26:01.385 --> 02:26:05.008]  Now look, Bush wants to hold them indefinitely, forever.
[02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:10.512]  And the British Prime Minister says, we only want to hold them for 90 days.
[02:26:11.813 --> 02:26:14.854]  And the Parliament said, to hell with you, Buster, you can't do it.
[02:26:17.356 --> 02:26:18.416]  Well, it's ridiculous.
[02:26:18.796 --> 02:26:28.621]  How, how come England will defend the constitutional right to habeas corpus?
[02:26:30.402 --> 02:26:31.683]  And the United States said it won't.
[02:26:33.067 --> 02:26:36.349]  Well, Dr. Roberts, you sound like it's painful for you to talk like this.
[02:26:36.410 --> 02:26:43.154]  I mean, you've been what I'd call a mainstream conservative for a long time, defending the Bill of Rights, the Constitution.
[02:26:43.174 --> 02:26:46.737]  I understand that you understand... Why is it painful for me?
[02:26:46.817 --> 02:26:48.318]  These people aren't conservatives.
[02:26:48.338 --> 02:26:50.640]  There's nothing conservative about the Bush administration.
[02:26:50.660 --> 02:26:57.565]  Exactly, but that's what I'm saying is that none of us are safe, and the heart of America is that
[02:26:58.576 --> 02:27:03.817]  Bill of Rights, that Constitution, habeas corpus, that's why we're America, and they're taking all that away!
[02:27:04.337 --> 02:27:07.558]  So why is the Senate overturning it?
[02:27:10.719 --> 02:27:15.299]  And we contrast that with Britain, and they won't even let Blair have 90 days.
[02:27:15.560 --> 02:27:21.781]  They said, alright, we'll let a person be held 28 days without charges.
[02:27:21.961 --> 02:27:22.701]  That's it.
[02:27:23.738 --> 02:27:27.001]  In the United States, they're holding them forever without charges.
[02:27:27.101 --> 02:27:30.403]  Hey, after four years of torture, they'll do whatever you say.
[02:27:30.423 --> 02:27:34.226]  Then we can parade them out and scare the public into submission.
[02:27:35.527 --> 02:27:36.448]  We're on the march.
[02:27:36.928 --> 02:27:38.529]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:38.549 --> 02:27:42.112]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:28:00.184 --> 02:28:03.825]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[02:28:04.065 --> 02:28:04.505]  And they can
[02:28:04.585 --> 02:28:06.087]  Do it without due process.

[02:31:14.485 --> 02:31:20.747]  It's gotten just so obvious now how out of control all of this is and we should all be upset.

[02:31:22.868 --> 02:31:23.228]  That's 1-800-259-9231.

[02:31:35.271 --> 02:31:35.891]  We're good to go.
[02:31:53.303 --> 02:32:03.415]  And Dr. Roberts, of course you were one of the major editors over at the Wall Street Journal, contributing editor for National Review.
[02:32:04.155 --> 02:32:06.798]  What is it like for you as a former Assistant Secretary of the U.S.
[02:32:06.859 --> 02:32:11.464]  Treasury in the Reagan Administration to see so many good conservative people?
[02:32:12.233 --> 02:32:13.273]  I guess they were good.
[02:32:13.313 --> 02:32:17.194]  I even have friends who I was on the page a hundred percent with five, six years ago.
[02:32:17.594 --> 02:32:20.014]  Now, they're like, yeah, we all got to take microchips.
[02:32:20.615 --> 02:32:25.595]  Yeah, because Bush and, you know, former Health and Human Secretary's person says it'll stop terrorism.
[02:32:25.715 --> 02:32:26.516]  Andy Rooney says it.
[02:32:26.536 --> 02:32:29.476]  I mean, this is insane body snatcher weird stuff.
[02:32:29.536 --> 02:32:30.776]  Oh, torture's good.
[02:32:31.016 --> 02:32:32.797]  We got to maybe give up some Second Amendment.
[02:32:32.817 --> 02:32:34.577]  So what if Bush is for the assault weapons ban?
[02:32:34.817 --> 02:32:36.337]  So what if Bush wants amnesty?
[02:32:36.617 --> 02:32:38.518]  I mean, they're not even conservatives anymore.
[02:32:38.578 --> 02:32:39.498]  They are literally
[02:32:39.898 --> 02:32:55.047]  Bush worshippers, Brown Shirt says, I know you've called them, I want to get into more on the torture, more on the police state being set up here domestically, but when you talk to your old conservative friends and they're still worshipping Bush, what do you say to them?
[02:32:55.727 --> 02:32:58.008]  Well, the real conservatives don't.
[02:32:58.989 --> 02:33:00.850]  They're not in those places anymore.
[02:33:01.490 --> 02:33:04.792]  There's no conservatives on the Wall Street Journal editorial page.
[02:33:04.852 --> 02:33:07.994]  Everybody that I work with there has been run off.
[02:33:08.726 --> 02:33:10.466]  The same at National Review.
[02:33:10.526 --> 02:33:15.387]  The people at National Review are nothing like the people that used to be at National Review.
[02:33:15.407 --> 02:33:16.468]  They've all been run off.
[02:33:19.908 --> 02:33:23.149]  There aren't any conservatives in those places.
[02:33:23.169 --> 02:33:24.950]  You know, they're what I call Jacobins.
[02:33:25.730 --> 02:33:27.930]  Neo-Jacobins or Neo-Nazis.
[02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:33.691]  But look, let me, I want to make one point here and then let's move on to the economy.
[02:33:34.072 --> 02:33:35.792]  Because that affects people too.
[02:33:36.616 --> 02:33:52.548]  I don't know if you, you may have already covered this Alex, but yesterday in the publication Capitol Hill Blue, it reports a confidential memo circulating among senior Republican leaders, suggests that a new attack by terrorists on U.S.
[02:33:52.648 --> 02:34:00.974]  soil could reverse the sagging fortunes of President George Bush, as well as the sagging fortunes of the GOP.
[02:34:00.994 --> 02:34:03.276]  You know, we got wiped out in the election the other day.
[02:34:04.091 --> 02:34:07.174]  And restore Bush's image as a leader of the American people.
[02:34:07.835 --> 02:34:14.882]  This is a closely guarded memo and it lays out a list of scenarios, another terrorist attack on the U.S.
[02:34:15.383 --> 02:34:19.227]  in order to bring the Republican Party back from the political brink.
[02:34:20.668 --> 02:34:25.854]  So there it shows you the way these so-called Republicans think.
[02:34:26.760 --> 02:34:30.547]  I'd like to say, too, these are nothing like the Republicans I work with.
[02:34:30.588 --> 02:34:33.293]  They're nothing like the Republicans in the Bush administration.
[02:34:33.393 --> 02:34:35.618]  I don't know who these people are or where they came from.
[02:34:36.560 --> 02:34:37.943]  It's almost like they came from out of
[02:34:41.419 --> 02:34:42.340]  Doctor, are you still there?
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:43.681]  Yeah.
[02:34:43.721 --> 02:34:44.902]  Your phone cut out for a second.
[02:34:44.922 --> 02:34:46.002]  It's almost like they're from where?
[02:34:46.263 --> 02:34:46.983]  Out of space.
[02:34:47.584 --> 02:34:54.529]  No, it is very alien to our form of government and our way of life, but we have other memos from the U.S.
[02:34:54.569 --> 02:34:57.491]  government going back where they talk about terror attacks being helpful.
[02:34:57.531 --> 02:35:02.916]  We have Gary Hart of the big CFR Commission, days after 9-11, saying we need to use this disaster.
[02:35:04.256 --> 02:35:05.517]  To get a new world order.
[02:35:06.197 --> 02:35:07.637]  To get people's freedoms and liberty.
[02:35:07.697 --> 02:35:10.918]  Let's make lemonade out of these lemons.
[02:35:12.699 --> 02:35:14.279]  I don't think it's going to work for them.
[02:35:15.040 --> 02:35:18.541]  I think they're going down in flames, myself.
[02:35:18.601 --> 02:35:19.901]  Well, I agree with you, sir, but let me say this.
[02:35:20.061 --> 02:35:23.682]  I was not aware of this Capitol Hill Blue, which is very reputable.
[02:35:23.922 --> 02:35:27.924]  We're going to be posting that right now, specifically, sir.
[02:35:28.004 --> 02:35:28.504]  Fill us in.
[02:35:28.544 --> 02:35:29.064]  Tell me about it.
[02:35:29.828 --> 02:35:30.349]  Well, I did.
[02:35:31.229 --> 02:35:35.192]  It's Capitol Hill Blue, November 10th.
[02:35:35.332 --> 02:35:36.393]  Doug Thompson.
[02:35:39.676 --> 02:35:42.838]  If you have an email, I can send you the URL.
[02:35:43.278 --> 02:35:44.239]  Oh, we can find it, sir.
[02:35:44.259 --> 02:35:45.560]  What's the headline you have in front of you?
[02:35:46.688 --> 02:35:52.793]  GOP memo touts new terror attack as way to reverse party's decline.
[02:35:53.394 --> 02:35:55.316]  Well, that's a smoking gun right there!
[02:35:56.156 --> 02:36:01.160]  Well, it doesn't say they themselves were gonna... No, I know, but it shows them openly talking about it.
[02:36:01.220 --> 02:36:03.362]  I mean, this is just... Boy, that would be helpful!
[02:36:04.003 --> 02:36:10.188]  Yeah, well, it may not work because it may simply prove that despite everything we're not safer.
[02:36:12.270 --> 02:36:13.731]  So it's hard to know whether they're
[02:36:14.798 --> 02:36:23.452]  But whether their idea would work or not, people may simply say, well look, you took away all the rights, we went to war, you said all this and all that, and we're not safer.
[02:36:24.890 --> 02:36:26.091]  Well, that is the problem.
[02:36:26.151 --> 02:36:28.853]  That is the problem with carrying out another terror attack.
[02:36:28.893 --> 02:36:30.814]  And that's why they're always trying to do focus groups.
[02:36:30.834 --> 02:36:32.535]  They've done focus groups engaged.
[02:36:32.835 --> 02:36:34.496]  They had a big study, what, a year ago.
[02:36:34.536 --> 02:36:41.000]  The White House paid for a study, I'm sure you heard about that, to see what our response would be to another terror attack.
[02:36:41.040 --> 02:36:48.745]  And they found a narrow majority at that time, now they've eroded even more, would support more of their police state policies if there was.
[02:36:48.765 --> 02:36:51.327]  See, I don't think people trust the President any longer.
[02:36:52.586 --> 02:36:53.186]  Oh, I agree.
[02:36:53.406 --> 02:37:01.370]  And so I don't know that they could get away with it, but it doesn't mean in desperation they wouldn't try.
[02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:04.271]  But look, Alex, let's talk a bit about the economy.
[02:37:04.291 --> 02:37:05.271]  Let's be specific, sir.
[02:37:05.311 --> 02:37:07.952]  In desperation they wouldn't try what, Dr. Roberts?
[02:37:09.353 --> 02:37:11.534]  They wouldn't try some sort of terrorist attack.
[02:37:14.535 --> 02:37:16.295]  Please continue about the economy.
[02:37:16.756 --> 02:37:19.857]  Look, Alex, when I was doing Russian studies,
[02:37:21.414 --> 02:37:32.543]  I learned that the Czarist secret police used to conduct bombings so they could blame somebody they wanted to get and arrest them.
[02:37:32.744 --> 02:37:37.467]  Yeah, that was the white Russian's favorite trick and then of course the Commissariat learned that and they passed it on.
[02:37:38.428 --> 02:37:48.116]  Yeah, so, you know, the kinds of black job operations that governments do are notorious.
[02:37:49.226 --> 02:37:53.027]  But, let's, uh, can we talk a little bit about the economy?
[02:37:53.427 --> 02:37:55.887]  Because... Oh, absolutely, sir, please!
[02:37:56.308 --> 02:37:58.428]  That's what's really... Yeah, that's your specialty.
[02:37:58.468 --> 02:38:00.188]  Tell us about your particular position.
[02:38:00.208 --> 02:38:04.109]  I mean, you were basically, in your position, Doctor, wasn't it running the Treasury?
[02:38:04.129 --> 02:38:06.950]  Uh, the economic policy, yeah.
[02:38:08.230 --> 02:38:15.852]  Look, are you aware that President George Bush has now borrowed more money
[02:38:16.949 --> 02:38:23.515]  from foreign governments and foreign banks than every previous U.S.
[02:38:23.576 --> 02:38:24.697]  President combined.
[02:38:24.717 --> 02:38:34.486]  Did you know that he has run up more debt in his time in office than we did in the first 224 years by existence from 1776 until 2000?
[02:38:41.821 --> 02:38:42.781]  I was not aware of that.
[02:38:42.861 --> 02:38:49.542]  I knew that he had spent more than three or four presidents combined, but no, I wasn't aware of that.
[02:38:49.922 --> 02:38:53.283]  No, not just spent, but borrowed from foreigners.
[02:38:54.683 --> 02:38:55.503]  Foreign borrowing.
[02:38:55.603 --> 02:39:00.204]  Well, that's why a lot of experts are saying it looks like they're actually trying to bring America down.
[02:39:01.865 --> 02:39:10.266]  Well, it certainly has given Asians tremendous power over us, because they hold enough of
[02:39:11.089 --> 02:39:17.930]  They've got treasury bonds now that just the threat to dump them would send our interest rates skyrocketing.
[02:39:17.950 --> 02:39:20.731]  Well, the CFR openly laughs at America.
[02:39:20.851 --> 02:39:22.091]  I've taped them on C-SPAN.
[02:39:22.351 --> 02:39:23.471]  Oh, it's over for us.
[02:39:23.531 --> 02:39:24.791]  It'll be the China century.
[02:39:24.831 --> 02:39:25.672]  They're the model.
[02:39:25.892 --> 02:39:27.232]  That's where we're all investing.
[02:39:27.472 --> 02:39:31.813]  I mean, I'm sure you've read and heard where they gleefully dance on our graves, these pieces of trash.
[02:39:33.313 --> 02:39:36.093]  Well, I suspect it will be China's century.
[02:39:36.613 --> 02:39:38.314]  Well, what is wrong with these neocons?
[02:39:38.354 --> 02:39:39.774]  Why do they want to destroy America?
[02:39:40.925 --> 02:39:41.805]  I don't know the answer.
[02:39:44.826 --> 02:39:50.047]  But the real question is, why do Americans put up with them?
[02:39:51.068 --> 02:39:51.928]  It's our fault.
[02:39:52.088 --> 02:39:53.148]  There's only a few of them.
[02:39:53.648 --> 02:39:56.509]  You and I could probably take them out.
[02:39:58.009 --> 02:39:59.110]  There's not very many of them.
[02:40:00.610 --> 02:40:01.870]  Why do Americans put up with them?
[02:40:01.890 --> 02:40:03.051]  Why do Americans believe them?
[02:40:03.131 --> 02:40:04.391]  Why do Americans vote for them?
[02:40:06.307 --> 02:40:07.248]  It's amazing to me.
[02:40:07.468 --> 02:40:11.011]  Doctor, it's almost like they have a spell, but I think the spell is lifting.
[02:40:11.031 --> 02:40:12.052]  I mean, you were talking about that earlier.
[02:40:12.072 --> 02:40:13.373]  People are starting to see through it.
[02:40:14.213 --> 02:40:19.938]  Maybe, but let's get on now with the jobs.
[02:40:21.399 --> 02:40:28.965]  The October job report came out a week ago, and the economy only created 46,000 private sector jobs.
[02:40:32.670 --> 02:40:40.614]  Not even half of what was expected and not even a quarter of what it takes just to stay even with population.
[02:40:41.994 --> 02:40:48.917]  Moreover, almost all those jobs were in construction and I would bet went to Mexicans.
[02:40:49.978 --> 02:40:54.740]  So probably no jobs created for native-born Americans.
[02:40:56.001 --> 02:40:57.721]  But the same month of October,
[02:40:59.389 --> 02:41:03.052]  The corporations laid off 81,301 people.
[02:41:04.433 --> 02:41:12.138]  So the layoff rate is twice the job rate and those are jobs that probably didn't go.
[02:41:12.518 --> 02:41:17.121]  But Rush Limbaugh says our economy is the best it's ever been and it's a dirty, commie lie.
[02:41:17.341 --> 02:41:19.423]  What's the point of bringing up that fool?
[02:41:20.003 --> 02:41:21.244]  Let's just stick to facts.
[02:41:22.325 --> 02:41:25.447]  Rush Limbaugh hasn't got enough sense to justify his existence.
[02:41:27.719 --> 02:41:29.060]  I'm not interested in that fool.
[02:41:29.340 --> 02:41:33.102]  Well, I mean, maybe if you take 100 Oxycontin a day, it gives you some type of insight.
[02:41:33.242 --> 02:41:34.083]  Oh yeah, I bet.
[02:41:34.303 --> 02:41:41.887]  Now, so what does it mean if the layoff rate is twice the rate of new jobs?
[02:41:44.729 --> 02:41:46.470]  It's not a very promising
[02:41:48.022 --> 02:41:49.403]  It's not a very promising outlook.
[02:41:49.523 --> 02:41:53.104]  Can I bring up another economic indice, and that's energy.
[02:41:54.064 --> 02:42:03.427]  We have the oil companies own memos, starting back nine years ago, where they said we're going to buy up all the small, and I mean all, refineries, shut them down, restrict and cut back ours.
[02:42:03.927 --> 02:42:12.610]  Then I watch it and then rip people off, create an artificial bottleneck, griping about Saddam over pumping, griping about Venezuela, because there's too much oil, they want to restrict it.
[02:42:13.310 --> 02:42:16.013]  I don't think the oil companies, the American oil companies don't own much oil anymore.
[02:42:16.073 --> 02:42:18.114]  They're mainly just retailers of gasoline.
[02:42:32.742 --> 02:42:36.223]  And they're actually even going out of the refinery business.
[02:42:36.243 --> 02:42:40.384]  You can't build a refinery in the United States because of all the environmental stuff.
[02:42:40.524 --> 02:42:43.804]  No, I understand, but that's how this whole thing has been set up.
[02:42:43.824 --> 02:42:50.506]  So my question is, where is it going with the energy prices being so high?
[02:42:53.106 --> 02:42:56.167]  Or where is it going with all prices going to be so high?
[02:42:56.307 --> 02:42:58.967]  Look, let me get on with this stuff.
[02:42:59.047 --> 02:43:01.068]  You want to talk about oil, let's look at it this way.
[02:43:06.681 --> 02:43:07.341]  The U.S.
[02:43:07.421 --> 02:43:20.907]  trade deficit with China alone, with just China, the American trade deficit with China, is 28% greater than our entire oil import bill.
[02:43:21.208 --> 02:43:23.068]  Isn't it like $80 billion a month or something?
[02:43:23.088 --> 02:43:24.209]  No, it's $160 billion last year.
[02:43:30.922 --> 02:43:33.524]  I guess the total trade deficit every month was $80-something billion.
[02:43:33.564 --> 02:43:34.324]  I saw that number.
[02:43:34.344 --> 02:43:39.888]  The total trade deficit this year was about $700 billion.
[02:43:41.149 --> 02:43:42.389]  So you can divide that by 12.
[02:43:43.070 --> 02:43:46.552]  I wonder why I saw that number of a trade deficit of $80-something billion in one month.
[02:43:46.592 --> 02:43:48.093]  Maybe it was some big month or something.
[02:43:49.094 --> 02:43:53.397]  It could have been that much in any month.
[02:43:54.597 --> 02:44:00.261]  But to look at this, see, people say, oh what about, we have to have
[02:44:01.387 --> 02:44:02.488]  Energy independence.
[02:44:02.828 --> 02:44:03.769]  Energy independence.
[02:44:04.630 --> 02:44:19.580]  But our energy imports are small compared to our imports of advanced technology products, manufactured goods, consumer goods, automobiles.
[02:44:21.361 --> 02:44:24.783]  If we need energy independence, why don't we need manufacturing independence?
[02:44:25.104 --> 02:44:27.945]  Why don't we need innovation independence?
[02:44:28.186 --> 02:44:28.606]  What is it?
[02:44:29.286 --> 02:44:39.349]  That people are so fixated on energy for, because, as I just pointed out... Well, it's something they can actually feel on a day-to-day basis.
[02:44:39.589 --> 02:44:40.870]  It's something they can actually see.
[02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:52.473]  Well, maybe they can actually see it, but it's not a significant element in our imports.
[02:44:52.753 --> 02:44:54.254]  It's not a significant element
[02:44:55.690 --> 02:44:58.192]  Well, Dr. Roberts, where do you see it going then?
[02:44:58.212 --> 02:45:03.696]  I mean, if the neocons stay in, or if they fall, or will we go into a depression?
[02:45:03.936 --> 02:45:08.180]  I mean, where do you see this going over the next year, the next five years, the next ten years?
[02:45:08.220 --> 02:45:09.220]  Give us your prognosis.
[02:45:09.240 --> 02:45:10.582]  Well, Alex, here's what's happening.
[02:45:11.743 --> 02:45:19.629]  Middle class jobs are being outsourced, or being filled by importing foreigners on work visas.
[02:45:20.329 --> 02:45:23.472]  H-1B work visas, L-1 work visas, so that
[02:45:24.187 --> 02:45:28.590]  The American middle class hasn't got any employment.
[02:45:28.750 --> 02:45:33.733]  They're being, their jobs are all shipped out or filled with foreigners.
[02:45:34.274 --> 02:45:38.056]  So this will close down, this will kill the universities.
[02:45:38.296 --> 02:45:40.218]  They're being systematically targeted.
[02:45:42.079 --> 02:45:43.680]  Well, it can look that way.
[02:45:43.740 --> 02:45:49.364]  I think it's just short run stupidity, myself, on the part of corporations.
[02:45:50.465 --> 02:45:51.106]  We're good to go.
[02:46:01.337 --> 02:46:02.537]  Who's going to buy this stuff here?
[02:46:02.817 --> 02:46:13.859]  Well, Dr. Roberts, the globalist in many different official UN reports and others have said this internationalism is about global corporations being more powerful than any country, and they want us all interdependent.
[02:46:13.879 --> 02:46:15.700]  They don't want a strong nation-state.
[02:46:15.720 --> 02:46:17.180]  They don't want a strong America.
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:22.241]  Look, they may not, but they won't be able to do anything about China or India or Russia.
[02:46:22.741 --> 02:46:24.361]  They're not going to put up with the globalists.
[02:46:24.681 --> 02:46:29.242]  Yeah, why is the elite giving up its main engine of power, the United States?
[02:46:31.660 --> 02:46:33.722]  That's the question.
[02:46:33.802 --> 02:46:35.884]  I think it's just utter stupidity.
[02:46:35.964 --> 02:46:36.985]  It's short run.
[02:46:37.245 --> 02:46:44.851]  It's three month quarterly reporting where everyone focuses on what's the three months results.
[02:46:45.051 --> 02:46:52.678]  And oh well, we laid off another 10,000 people and hired Indians in their place and our profits went up and we get bigger bonuses.
[02:46:53.659 --> 02:46:55.861]  And that's as good an explanation as any.
[02:46:56.041 --> 02:46:58.623]  It doesn't imply some kind of
[02:46:59.514 --> 02:47:02.616]  But why would there be federal programs to pay U.S.
[02:47:02.676 --> 02:47:05.999]  companies to move overseas and then ensure the investment if it fails?
[02:47:08.721 --> 02:47:20.349]  A lot of those things date from the Cold War, where one of our strategies to contain communism was to develop the vulnerable
[02:47:21.189 --> 02:47:26.792]  Countries, the ones that were poor and poverty-stricken and seem to be... Yeah, prop them up.
[02:47:26.832 --> 02:47:36.517]  So these things last long beyond... It's the Cold War is over, but the program system is still there.
[02:47:37.037 --> 02:47:42.020]  So what is the... I mean, even the short-term prognosis, what do you think is going to happen?
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:45.021]  Do you think the neocons will fall, or will they just keep rolling on?
[02:47:45.041 --> 02:47:46.922]  You know, they're talking about going into Syria right now.
[02:47:46.962 --> 02:47:48.543]  They just broke relations with them.
[02:47:49.960 --> 02:47:57.865]  Yeah, I think that they're going to fall, because I don't think the world's going to put up with them.
[02:47:59.426 --> 02:48:03.028]  And we think we're a superpower, but we're not.
[02:48:04.409 --> 02:48:09.732]  When you produce, see, this year the budget deficit is about $500 billion.
[02:48:09.752 --> 02:48:11.233]  The trade deficit is about $700 billion.
[02:48:11.253 --> 02:48:13.314]  That's $1.2 trillion we had to borrow, mainly from foreigners.
[02:48:18.992 --> 02:48:19.813]  They're our bankers.
[02:48:21.234 --> 02:48:23.556]  If they say, well, we're not going to lend, we're helpless.
[02:48:24.457 --> 02:48:25.538]  We're not a superpower.
[02:48:29.461 --> 02:48:32.103]  Stay with us, sir, for a final segment on the other side.
[02:48:32.123 --> 02:48:33.704]  We're talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:48:33.724 --> 02:48:36.086]  We've been covering a whole gamut of issues.
[02:48:36.186 --> 02:48:37.067]  Very informative.
[02:48:37.627 --> 02:48:42.751]  And coming up later, we'll have Bob Dacey in studio who went to the Free Trade Area of the Americas meeting.
[02:48:43.932 --> 02:48:44.293]  Interesting.
[02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:51.907]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.228 --> 02:48:53.589]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:53.789 --> 02:48:56.012]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.152 --> 02:48:58.234]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:58.514 --> 02:49:03.459]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:03.800 --> 02:49:07.824]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.064 --> 02:49:09.845]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[02:49:09.925 --> 02:49:20.573]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[02:49:20.713 --> 02:49:22.614]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[02:49:22.814 --> 02:49:26.697]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today, and man the guns of the info war.

[02:49:44.699 --> 02:49:46.320]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:49:46.440 --> 02:49:50.564]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:49:50.684 --> 02:49:53.546]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:49:53.646 --> 02:50:00.371]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:50:00.552 --> 02:50:03.554]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:50:03.754 --> 02:50:06.136]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:50:06.276 --> 02:50:11.000]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove
[02:50:11.220 --> 02:50:20.489]  Try Halo Methanes and Volatile Organic Elements such as Atcozine, Benzene, Chloride and Chloroform, MTBE, Radon-222, Foul Taste and Obnoxious Odors like Sulfur.
[02:50:20.629 --> 02:50:25.754]  Even Nitrates and Unwanted Heavy Metals such as Lead, Mercury and Aluminum are extracted.
[02:50:25.895 --> 02:50:32.541]  Supercharge your Gravity Filter today and order a 2-pack of Blank Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a 4-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at

[02:50:37.625 --> 02:50:39.426]  That's 808-803-4438.

[02:51:01.198 --> 02:51:01.799]  I think so.
[02:51:21.397 --> 02:51:21.997]  We're good to go!
[02:51:51.535 --> 02:52:02.042]  You know, I was down at the studio actually trying to kick the Basset Hound out of the studio.
[02:52:02.062 --> 02:52:03.262]  He tried to climb up in my lap.
[02:52:03.322 --> 02:52:04.503]  He's a huge Basset Hound.
[02:52:04.563 --> 02:52:08.506]  One of my staff's dog, Baron.
[02:52:09.206 --> 02:52:12.028]  Always causing problems, so I didn't find out during the break.
[02:52:12.068 --> 02:52:14.530]  Can Dr. Roberts stay with us five minutes to the next hour?
[02:52:15.462 --> 02:52:15.782]  Good!
[02:52:16.403 --> 02:52:18.884]  Conduct that business here on air, that way we can jam in.
[02:52:19.364 --> 02:52:21.305]  Ron, Jeff, Mark, Charles, and Lou.
[02:52:21.325 --> 02:52:23.486]  Lou's been holding the longest, but I don't think he's for the guest.
[02:52:23.506 --> 02:52:25.087]  We'll get to you with Bob Daisy.
[02:52:25.127 --> 02:52:26.788]  Lou, if you want to hold even more, God bless you.
[02:52:28.069 --> 02:52:34.812]  Dr. Roberts, we've just got about three minutes now and about five minutes to the next hour, but just in a nutshell before I go to these calls, and I'm going to go right to them.
[02:52:35.692 --> 02:52:37.553]  We've got the new Fed chairman coming in.
[02:52:37.593 --> 02:52:39.534]  We've got him saying, I'll print even more money.
[02:52:39.635 --> 02:52:40.575]  I love printing money.
[02:52:40.855 --> 02:52:41.856]  Where do you see it going?
[02:52:41.876 --> 02:52:43.416]  I mean, are they going to lead us into total ruin?
[02:52:45.583 --> 02:52:47.384]  Yes, they're going to lead us into total ruin.
[02:52:49.726 --> 02:52:53.008]  They're destroying the tax base with the middle class.
[02:52:54.709 --> 02:53:01.534]  The spending is out of control, and they're entirely dependent on foreign borrowing.
[02:53:02.355 --> 02:53:08.659]  They have to borrow from foreigners, which gives foreigners more and more power over our policy.
[02:53:10.566 --> 02:53:16.421]  We can nix anything we want to do just by threatening to dump the holdings of treasury bonds.
[02:53:17.472 --> 02:53:22.054]  And so could the Japanese, but they seem to be too tame to do anything like that.
[02:53:22.134 --> 02:53:24.115]  But if they wanted to, they could bring us down.
[02:53:24.715 --> 02:53:26.596]  China routinely threatens it, as you know.
[02:53:26.636 --> 02:53:27.436]  Let's take a call.
[02:53:27.876 --> 02:53:31.438]  Ron in New York, here on the air with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts.
[02:53:31.478 --> 02:53:31.898]  Go ahead.
[02:53:32.338 --> 02:53:33.278]  Good afternoon, gentlemen.
[02:53:33.358 --> 02:53:39.501]  Doctor, it's a pleasure to hear a man who can apply logic so cogently and so precisely to the doctor.
[02:53:39.801 --> 02:53:40.801]  Good to hear from you, Ron.
[02:53:41.141 --> 02:53:43.642]  Yes, yes, I've been out of circulation for a while, but I'm back.
[02:53:44.043 --> 02:53:44.783]  What's on your mind?
[02:53:45.780 --> 02:53:50.626]  Okay, to address a few things relative, of course, to what the doctor has been driving at.
[02:53:51.226 --> 02:54:01.358]  Today it was actually reported in New York Newsday that the police commissioner of New York City has gone into a memorandum of understanding with the Central Intelligence Agency.
[02:54:02.077 --> 02:54:05.920]  We have a local, it has to be emphasized, local enforcement agency.
[02:54:06.040 --> 02:54:06.981]  Oh, we have it in Austin.
[02:54:07.001 --> 02:54:08.803]  They're setting up local commissariats.
[02:54:09.623 --> 02:54:18.330]  And in fact, he has retained, and it seems to be a very favorite place for people who retire from the CIA to come and get a job in retirement, the NYPD.
[02:54:19.091 --> 02:54:21.453]  So we definitely got strange going on here.
[02:54:21.793 --> 02:54:26.617]  A few other things that have struck me very odd over the last several weeks, and they follow this way.
[02:54:27.578 --> 02:54:31.341]  I begin to strongly suspect events in the world, case in point,
[02:54:32.415 --> 02:54:34.397]  The explosions in Jordan.
[02:54:35.117 --> 02:54:45.765]  Now, if anybody knows Muslim culture or Arabic culture, they would know that attacking a wedding is an extremely taboo thing to do in that culture, if you're not aware of that.
[02:54:46.285 --> 02:54:47.686]  That's a very, very taboo thing.
[02:54:48.167 --> 02:54:53.470]  Oh, but Mr. Al-Syed, Abu Absab al-Zawahiri, he took credit.
[02:54:53.490 --> 02:54:57.794]  He's only been killed 10 times and injured 50 times and murdered 24 times.
[02:54:57.854 --> 02:54:59.215]  I mean, it's just total goads.
[02:55:00.175 --> 02:55:05.077]  My point is, why would a leader looking for empathy in the Arab world do something like that?
[02:55:05.137 --> 02:55:08.779]  I think he has a very good point, Alex.
[02:55:09.319 --> 02:55:21.304]  He has a very good point, and I saw the Israeli newspaper Haaretz initially said that all the Israelis in those hotels had been given prior warning and were pulled out.
[02:55:21.464 --> 02:55:24.886]  And it's confirmed that Netanyahu got a warning on 7-7.
[02:55:24.906 --> 02:55:27.067]  They later retracted that.
[02:55:28.630 --> 02:55:33.214]  But I think the caller did have a very cogent observation.
[02:55:33.434 --> 02:55:35.415]  What about local CIA offices?
[02:55:35.455 --> 02:55:36.356]  They're setting those up.
[02:55:38.397 --> 02:55:42.380]  Well, it's just more paraphernalia of the police state.
[02:55:42.740 --> 02:55:43.681]  But that's illegal!
[02:55:43.901 --> 02:55:45.362]  They haven't changed that law!
[02:55:45.382 --> 02:55:48.004]  You don't list about everything they do is illegal, Alex.
[02:55:50.105 --> 02:55:51.046]  The war is illegal.
[02:55:52.805 --> 02:55:54.046]  How do they get away with that?
[02:55:54.066 --> 02:56:00.009]  Write the memo that says torture people, and then they say they're for torture, but then they send people who follow their orders to prison?
[02:56:00.129 --> 02:56:02.271]  It looks like Americans just don't care.
[02:56:02.811 --> 02:56:04.372]  It looks like they don't care.
[02:56:07.634 --> 02:56:11.276]  Or they're macho, or they're, oh well, that's just ragheads.
[02:56:12.937 --> 02:56:13.678]  Yeah, they don't understand.
[02:56:13.718 --> 02:56:15.559]  This whole thing is directed at us, folks.
[02:56:16.605 --> 02:56:17.546]  That's unbelievable.
[02:56:17.786 --> 02:56:18.466]  Stay there, sir.
[02:56:18.506 --> 02:56:20.267]  We'll be right back with a quick five-minute segment.
[02:56:20.287 --> 02:56:21.928]  We'll jam in three more calls for you.
[02:56:22.169 --> 02:56:23.249]  Callers, it's going to be quick.
[02:56:23.269 --> 02:56:24.370]  Stay with us.
[02:56:25.050 --> 02:56:29.633]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
