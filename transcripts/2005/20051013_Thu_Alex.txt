[00:00:05.178 --> 00:00:05.818]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:07.540]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.441]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.022 --> 00:00:10.842]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:13.104]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.164 --> 00:00:16.827]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.348 --> 00:00:21.411]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.686 --> 00:00:41.627]  Welcome, my friends.
[00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:49.231]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday, the 13th day of October 2005.
[00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:53.774]  We're going to be here live for the next three hours.
[00:00:54.194 --> 00:00:58.777]  Coming up, we're going to talk to a real weather modification expert.
[00:00:58.857 --> 00:01:01.879]  I saw this article in the Midland Reporter-Telegram article.
[00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:06.269]  So my producer got this guest to come on with us.
[00:01:07.269 --> 00:01:18.955]  Waylon Ben Livingston, known, of course, as a veteran and a hero of Korea and Vietnam, is also a weather modification expert.
[00:01:18.995 --> 00:01:25.498]  And Waylon Ben Livingston knows his ideas are controversial, so he steps lightly when talking about them.
[00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.619]  His theories have been proven.
[00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:28.520]  The technology...
[00:01:29.392 --> 00:01:30.353]  He is in place.
[00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:34.896]  Research shows his ideas could save hundreds, maybe even thousands of lives.
[00:01:35.316 --> 00:01:42.060]  He was a fascinating man with credentials as long as the wingspan of the airplanes he flew as a commander for the U.S.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.801]  Navy in Korea and Vietnam.
[00:01:44.382 --> 00:01:51.906]  Livingston, now 77, worked inside the federal government, inside the military, as a weather modification specialist.
[00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:55.849]  He'll be joining us coming up in the next hour.
[00:01:57.071 --> 00:02:04.372]  And we'll get his take on HAARP and on Secretary of Defense Cohen's comments about the new weapons being weather control weapons.
[00:02:04.973 --> 00:02:26.717]  We'll get his take on, of course, the meteorologist out of Pocatello, Idaho, and much more coming up in the next hour as we continue to investigate weather control, weather modification that's now hit the mainstream of America from the fringes of even this broadcast many years ago to mainstream news today.
[00:02:27.694 --> 00:02:32.478]  It is 2005, ladies and gentlemen, and we are now in the future.
[00:02:32.538 --> 00:02:42.527]  We are now living the future, and the private crime syndicate that controls our government and the globe has been suppressing technology for over 50 years.
[00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:48.512]  We are at least 30 years ahead of what we publicly have available or even know about.
[00:02:49.693 --> 00:02:54.777]  But it's becoming increasingly hard for the global controllers to hide all of this technology.
[00:02:56.044 --> 00:03:04.567]  We're now learning their plans for us, and of course it mirrors the data we have collected over the years by going to urban warfare training drills.
[00:03:05.207 --> 00:03:08.708]  Pentagon plans to beef up domestic rapid response forces.
[00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.729]  This is out of the Washington Post.
[00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:17.271]  They'll be totally federalized and will be our new federal force to dominate the states as well as our populations.
[00:03:18.151 --> 00:03:22.713]  Has nothing to do with fighting terrorism or keeping us safe during disasters.
[00:03:23.273 --> 00:03:25.634]  This is Caesar crossing the Rubicon.
[00:03:26.354 --> 00:03:27.575]  This is dictatorship.
[00:03:27.615 --> 00:03:37.221]  This is what Ron Paul, two days ago, Congressman Ron Paul said on this broadcast, is government preparation for gun confiscation and total enslavement.
[00:03:38.722 --> 00:03:40.203]  Now that's what Ron Paul said.
[00:03:40.383 --> 00:03:54.632]  And the article that we wrote, basically it's just a transcript of his comments, is posted on prisonplanet.com as well as infowars.com, but it hasn't gotten the attention it deserves.
[00:03:55.862 --> 00:04:15.069]  It is a very important story, because it isn't Alex Jones saying it, it's not some other talk show host saying it, it's Ron Paul, a veteran of Vietnam, a medical doctor, with the most conservative voting record in the Congress, and he said the government is moving for martial law and gun confiscation.
[00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:17.510]  This is the plan.
[00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:19.730]  Do you understand?
[00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.211]  Not a drill, not a game.
[00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:26.787]  Throughout history, powerful elites seek to set up dictatorships, seek to enslave.
[00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:28.348]  It is the nature of power.
[00:04:28.948 --> 00:04:30.209]  It is the nature of history.
[00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.151]  And it is happening again.
[00:04:32.171 --> 00:04:36.054]  And no bout of beer or football will cover that up.
[00:04:38.015 --> 00:04:40.397]  You can try to drown your sorrows at the tapas bar.
[00:04:40.417 --> 00:04:41.498]  It ain't going to happen, folks.
[00:04:41.518 --> 00:04:43.039]  You better face what's happening.
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.002]  Pentagon plans to beef up domestic rapid response forces.
[00:04:47.122 --> 00:04:50.645]  All of this on the heels of discussions of impeachment and indictment.
[00:04:51.593 --> 00:04:53.557]  We live in very scary times.
[00:04:53.597 --> 00:04:56.702]  I mean, are you noticing what we're in the middle of right now?
[00:04:57.283 --> 00:04:58.085]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:58.105 --> 00:04:58.486]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.911 --> 00:05:07.774]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:09.454]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:05:09.634 --> 00:05:11.855]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:05:11.995 --> 00:05:14.096]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:19.298]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:05:19.638 --> 00:05:23.660]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.701]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:05:25.761 --> 00:05:36.425]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:05:36.565 --> 00:05:38.465]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:05:38.665 --> 00:05:42.547]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:05:42.627 --> 00:05:44.188]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:44.528]  That's 888-2533-139.
[00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.372]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:03.815]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:08.057]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.297 --> 00:06:11.098]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.278 --> 00:06:13.680]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:22.524]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.704 --> 00:06:24.065]  The Berkey Light is different.
[00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:28.387]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[00:06:28.407 --> 00:06:29.047]  We're good to go.
[00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:07.271]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:07.491 --> 00:07:12.493]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using the Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:20.737]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:20.877 --> 00:07:27.920]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:29.341]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:29.501 --> 00:07:32.904]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:07:32.945 --> 00:07:34.066]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[00:07:34.346 --> 00:07:35.627]  Eliminate the cause.
[00:07:35.847 --> 00:07:42.674]  BioSolutions has over 550 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:07:42.794 --> 00:07:45.236]  Customer satisfaction is guaranteed or your money back.
[00:07:45.416 --> 00:07:48.338]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free, 866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.358 --> 00:07:48.398]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.418 --> 00:07:49.439]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:49.499 --> 00:07:52.361]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:17.823]  We've got an expert on weather control, weather modification coming on, coming up in the next hour.
[00:08:17.843 --> 00:08:22.206]  We're going to have wide-open phones on this live Thursday, 13th day of October, 2005 edition.
[00:08:22.246 --> 00:08:23.907]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:25.268]  I did over nine hours of broadcast yesterday.
[00:08:25.288 --> 00:08:25.688]  Quite enjoyable.
[00:08:25.708 --> 00:08:27.369]  Two TV shows and, of course...
[00:08:39.306 --> 00:08:43.627]  My own radio show, a radio interview, and then three hours on coast to coast.
[00:08:44.247 --> 00:08:45.988]  And then my children woke me up at about 7.30 a.m.
[00:08:46.008 --> 00:08:48.028]  today after I went to bed about 5.
[00:08:49.048 --> 00:08:51.709]  So I am going to be in rare form today.
[00:08:51.749 --> 00:08:53.430]  You can absolutely be assured of that.
[00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.090]  I'm kind of being serious.
[00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.351]  Sometimes when I'm completely burnt out, I have better shows because it takes my hyper edge off.
[00:09:00.431 --> 00:09:02.812]  But who knows?
[00:09:02.912 --> 00:09:06.873]  Regardless, we're going to cover the vital news and information today.
[00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:09.141]  I think we're good to go.
[00:09:38.112 --> 00:09:49.276]  Now, we already knew this, but still, to have it just confirmed in their own secret, marked secret, marked highly confidential, not for distribution.
[00:09:50.316 --> 00:09:54.098]  Exxon, Mobil, Texaco, Chevron.
[00:09:55.698 --> 00:09:58.279]  I was on for three hours last night with George Norring.
[00:10:01.901 --> 00:10:02.621]  Really, just...
[00:10:03.348 --> 00:10:28.137]  Decimating, dismantling, annihilating, incinerating the fraud, the putrid lie that is peak oil and the entire pantheon, the entire gallery of problem reaction solution, artificial scarcity paradigms being pushed by the diamond cartel, the water cartels, the oil cartels, the technology cartels, all of them.
[00:10:29.926 --> 00:10:36.590]  It's the science of feudalism and control, and Norrie, of course, just let us go wherever we wanted to go.
[00:10:38.691 --> 00:10:53.699]  But on my own broadcast yesterday, I never got into this, and for those that don't know, we've pointed out that since the late 1970s, not a single new oil refinery has been opened in the United States.
[00:10:56.048 --> 00:10:58.011]  And, you know, I come from an oil family.
[00:10:58.151 --> 00:11:00.413]  I mean, my mother's father was a roughneck.
[00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:06.540]  My dad's uncle, you know, ran one of the major refineries in Houston until a few years ago when he retired.
[00:11:08.483 --> 00:11:12.667]  I have had just, you know, so many connections to oil and the business.
[00:11:13.028 --> 00:11:15.551]  A lot of family that have been petroleum geologists.
[00:11:19.375 --> 00:11:21.096]  And so it's always been a joke.
[00:11:21.617 --> 00:11:24.139]  Of course there's more oil than we can shake a stick at.
[00:11:24.179 --> 00:11:26.221]  Of course we're drowning in oil.
[00:11:26.261 --> 00:11:30.484]  I mean, that's just known by anybody who's close to oil.
[00:11:33.767 --> 00:11:40.292]  And literally, I mean, from my mother's brother who worked on oil rigs in college before he went to Vietnam to...
[00:11:41.204 --> 00:11:47.729]  The rest of my family that have been roughnecks and geologists, you name it, it just isn't true that we're running out of oil.
[00:11:47.749 --> 00:11:49.270]  We are literally grounding in it.
[00:11:49.691 --> 00:11:53.033]  They suck oil out of those wells in Africa.
[00:11:53.073 --> 00:11:59.518]  They suck it out of those wells in Venezuela or in Saudi Arabia or in Alaska, and it just refills itself.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.621]  And they're not even drilling deeply.
[00:12:03.641 --> 00:12:07.644]  When you drill deep, you just continually hit bigger and bigger reservoirs.
[00:12:08.245 --> 00:12:09.906]  But again, all that's a side issue.
[00:12:12.481 --> 00:12:19.447]  We can directly link the Club of Rome, which is a policy body of the Bilderberg Group.
[00:12:20.488 --> 00:12:22.390]  People always say, well, who really runs it, Alex?
[00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:32.178]  The Bilderberg Group, the Club of Rome, Committee of 300, Committee of 100, CFR, Trilateral Commission, Royal Institute of International Affairs.
[00:12:33.099 --> 00:12:34.020]  Who really runs it?
[00:12:34.080 --> 00:12:34.220]  Well,
[00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:48.216]  If you look at who heads up the Autobahn Society, who heads up the CFR, who heads up the Trilateral Commission, who's on the steering committee of the Bilderberg Group, you're only talking about 250 people or so.
[00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:50.757]  Give or take that number each year, it fluctuates.
[00:12:51.237 --> 00:12:54.799]  And the same little group sits on the boards of all these other groups.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.801]  It's just like a corporate or governmental structure.
[00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:03.023]  And they literally just fly around via Gulfstream and Learjet
[00:13:04.677 --> 00:13:11.743]  Around the globe with military escorts and protection, and they just are on a daily basis landing in some new city giving orders.
[00:13:13.044 --> 00:13:26.154]  They have total control of the IMF, World Bank, XM, International Bank of Settlements checkbooks out of computers that just produce more zeros and ones that we back up by our labor, blood, sweat, and tears.
[00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:32.179]  And we can trace back to the 56 when they created the fake theory of...
[00:13:34.634 --> 00:13:39.417]  This supposed oil running out, and we can see it tracked over 30 years ago to Club of Rome.
[00:13:39.737 --> 00:13:44.879]  Declassified population control documents released in CIA national security briefings.
[00:13:44.899 --> 00:13:46.240]  I mean, this is all public.
[00:13:48.823 --> 00:13:59.311]  Where they say that they've got to destroy the middle class, and they've got to reduce population forcibly, and that food, water, and oil, all energy resources in food, water, oil, it's all energy.
[00:13:59.531 --> 00:14:10.680]  Human energy for the human body, or energy for crops to feed the human body, or energy for your vehicle, energy for the power plant, energy for your space heater coming up this winter.
[00:14:15.804 --> 00:14:16.845]  And we've known
[00:14:17.501 --> 00:14:17.841]  This.
[00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:19.443]  I mean, this is not hidden.
[00:14:21.004 --> 00:14:24.747]  But everybody's talked about how they haven't built a new refinery since, what, 1977.
[00:14:25.048 --> 00:14:30.152]  This is with demand only going up and up and up and up.
[00:14:30.192 --> 00:14:37.238]  And we hear, oh, the environmentalists, which are one of the little attack dog groups, why they've kept new refineries from being built.
[00:14:37.258 --> 00:14:38.139]  This is how it works, folks.
[00:14:38.179 --> 00:14:39.260]  It's called rent-a-mob.
[00:14:40.012 --> 00:14:42.414]  Or it's called creating a fake grassroots organization.
[00:14:42.854 --> 00:14:53.141]  The government, controlled by the big oil companies, needs somebody to point to who, quote, is the public, saying they don't want more refineries to act like it's some organic grassroots movement.
[00:14:54.962 --> 00:15:02.327]  We've always known that it's the oil companies who will go in, buy up a private refinery for two or three times what it's worth.
[00:15:02.667 --> 00:15:03.408]  Oh, you don't want to sell?
[00:15:03.428 --> 00:15:04.068]  How about double?
[00:15:04.108 --> 00:15:04.668]  Don't want to sell?
[00:15:04.708 --> 00:15:05.329]  How about triple?
[00:15:06.414 --> 00:15:07.795]  Shut that sucker down.
[00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:10.376]  They don't get them out producing.
[00:15:14.577 --> 00:15:24.201]  The Bakersfield field, owned by Dutch Rochelle, outperforming, let me read the numbers here, by 51 times their projections.
[00:15:24.261 --> 00:15:24.961]  And what did they do?
[00:15:25.021 --> 00:15:27.322]  They were going to shut it down.
[00:15:28.143 --> 00:15:28.523]  And they did.
[00:15:28.543 --> 00:15:31.564]  And it was a big investigation and they were forced to sell it.
[00:15:32.637 --> 00:15:33.798]  Just shut it down.
[00:15:33.838 --> 00:15:43.843]  Because look, they'd rather sell you a gallon of gas for ten bucks and have a monopoly of control and not have any competition than sell you a gallon of gas for fifty cents, what it's really worth.
[00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:47.465]  These are monopoly men.
[00:15:47.505 --> 00:15:49.947]  This is about centralization of control.
[00:15:52.788 --> 00:16:01.333]  And so now we have these memos from Texaco and Chevron and Mobil and others
[00:16:02.678 --> 00:16:03.558]  I'm looking at them right here.
[00:16:03.578 --> 00:16:06.179]  They're posted on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:09.579]  Where they say, we're going to create artificial scarcity.
[00:16:09.599 --> 00:16:10.719]  This started in 1996.
[00:16:11.119 --> 00:16:14.460]  It had already been going on, these memos.
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.601]  We want to accelerate the shutdown of refineries all over the country.
[00:16:24.122 --> 00:16:31.463]  Because there's such an overabundance of production of oil, this is a way that we can jack up the prices.
[00:16:32.856 --> 00:16:34.237]  I mean, I'm actually reading it here.
[00:16:34.437 --> 00:16:35.197]  Please, go read it.
[00:16:37.238 --> 00:16:38.319]  You read the LA Times.
[00:16:38.339 --> 00:16:40.480]  I mean, they admit this is going on, but they really whitewash it.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.680]  Forget what the newspaper says.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:42.961]  That's bad enough.
[00:16:43.281 --> 00:16:46.222]  Go read the actual cynical memos.
[00:16:46.262 --> 00:16:47.443]  There's a whole bunch of them.
[00:16:48.023 --> 00:16:49.604]  I mean, where they laugh at us.
[00:16:49.664 --> 00:16:52.125]  It's a big, fat joke.
[00:16:52.225 --> 00:16:53.646]  And look, we already knew this.
[00:16:55.386 --> 00:16:58.588]  Again, we don't need to read secret documents to look at the facts.
[00:17:00.928 --> 00:17:06.234]  George Bush has control of the House, the Senate, the legislative, the entire legislative system.
[00:17:06.594 --> 00:17:10.639]  He's got the executive and 30-plus Republican governors, and he's got the judicial.
[00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:11.460]  And what are we seeing?
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:14.763]  They're not opening up the petroleum reserves in Alaska.
[00:17:17.086 --> 00:17:19.829]  It's got more sweet and light crude than all of Saudi Arabia.
[00:17:20.652 --> 00:17:21.753]  They're not doing any of that.
[00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:28.016]  They're not letting us open up the stuff off the coast of Louisiana and Mississippi that even dwarfs Alaska.
[00:17:28.296 --> 00:17:29.757]  They're not letting us have any of it.
[00:17:29.777 --> 00:17:36.341]  80% of the oil that's out of limited fields in Alaska fuels most of Japan and China.
[00:17:38.482 --> 00:17:40.183]  We're not even allowed to have our own oil.
[00:17:42.344 --> 00:17:43.624]  And so there's no debating it.
[00:17:43.665 --> 00:17:49.948]  People say, well, you said George Bush went into Iraq for oil, but no oil's flowing, so what do you mean he wanted oil?
[00:17:50.703 --> 00:18:04.813]  Don't you understand if they're discovering double the fields they thought of high-quality crude in Russia and all those trillions of gallons of oil up there in the stands, to Zikistan, Uzbekistan, the other five stands.
[00:18:07.234 --> 00:18:11.277]  They've got to go in there and dominate those regions so the oil can't flow.
[00:18:11.317 --> 00:18:11.597]  Listen.
[00:18:13.358 --> 00:18:17.161]  They really got mad at Saddam Hussein before the Gulf War, even though he was our big buddy.
[00:18:17.867 --> 00:18:21.249]  That's one of the reasons they shut him up and told him to go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[00:18:21.289 --> 00:18:21.950]  We're your ally.
[00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:24.251]  Because he was over-pumping, in their words.
[00:18:24.571 --> 00:18:26.413]  He was driving down the price.
[00:18:27.954 --> 00:18:29.174]  Saddam was greedy.
[00:18:31.616 --> 00:18:34.218]  And so he could make a little extra off selling a whole bunch of it.
[00:18:34.238 --> 00:18:38.321]  He was driving down the Saudi, the Venezuelan, the Alaskan crude prices.
[00:18:40.002 --> 00:18:41.022]  Don't you remember in 1990?
[00:18:41.262 --> 00:18:44.885]  The good old days of 80-cent gas?
[00:18:44.905 --> 00:18:44.965]  Yes.
[00:18:46.354 --> 00:18:49.596]  Well, a few months later after the war started, you were paying $1.50, weren't you?
[00:18:49.857 --> 00:18:50.757]  And now you wish for $1.50.
[00:18:53.919 --> 00:18:59.343]  So by the oil not flowing out of Iraq, they increase the price.
[00:18:59.724 --> 00:19:01.585]  It's called artificial scarcity.
[00:19:03.847 --> 00:19:07.149]  And another example of this is Diamond Empire, even on PBS.
[00:19:07.938 --> 00:19:10.260]  We interviewed the British lady who interviewed it.
[00:19:10.721 --> 00:19:17.887]  When she got off her private yacht after she completed production, a couple guys came on the boat, said, you better not release that film, and broke her jaw and beat her up.
[00:19:17.927 --> 00:19:32.181]  But she was able to get in, because she had these big credentials, to De Beers' warehouses in France and the Netherlands, giant warehouses full of huge crates literally brimming with diamonds.
[00:19:33.965 --> 00:19:40.912]  And you'll pay $5,000, $10,000 for one carrot, and they literally lay all over the ground in Africa.
[00:19:41.572 --> 00:19:43.114]  Heaps of them.
[00:19:43.254 --> 00:19:45.156]  They're semi-precious at best.
[00:19:45.576 --> 00:19:48.319]  Diamonds are barely on the scale of semi-precious.
[00:19:48.879 --> 00:19:50.521]  They are worthless.
[00:19:51.582 --> 00:19:57.768]  But through a monopoly, you'll mortgage the house because your fiancé demands it.
[00:19:58.528 --> 00:19:59.189]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.357 --> 00:20:08.244]  For months now, you've been hearing about the incredible health benefits of Zango, the functional health beverage made from the whole fruit of mangosteen.
[00:20:08.364 --> 00:20:21.297]  What you probably didn't know is that Zango joined forces with the leading manufacturer and distributor of functional health beverages like Capri Sun, Stobie, Mystic, and Red Bull to create the fastest growing business opportunity in America today.
[00:20:21.477 --> 00:20:23.279]  Are you sick of barely having enough money?
[00:20:23.439 --> 00:20:24.039]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.665 --> 00:20:43.046]  Call 888-203-6633 today!
[00:21:02.026 --> 00:21:05.010]  The Bergie Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:14.200]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:19.206]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:21:19.646 --> 00:21:26.370]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:38.557]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:21:39.037 --> 00:21:43.480]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:45.982]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:46.002 --> 00:21:47.963]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:21:47.983 --> 00:21:49.244]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:49.264 --> 00:21:50.725]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:21:50.745 --> 00:21:51.946]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:22:01.215 --> 00:22:03.616]  This report will provide you with financial history on the safest and
[00:22:30.691 --> 00:22:31.211]  We're good to go.
[00:23:01.750 --> 00:23:05.634]  Are your medicine cabinets full of a variety of medicines and creams for illness and pain?
[00:23:05.795 --> 00:23:07.537]  Now the alternative is drinking water.
[00:23:07.597 --> 00:23:08.858]  But not just any water.
[00:23:08.938 --> 00:23:13.163]  You need electrolyzed iodized water or EO from RPA Biotech.
[00:23:13.223 --> 00:23:22.934]  Drinking EO water has been noted for its ability to flush toxins, attract and neutralize free radicals, enhance the delivery of nutrients, and most importantly, supports the immune system.
[00:23:23.114 --> 00:23:23.815]  We're good to go.
[00:23:38.431 --> 00:23:39.311]  Or call 1-866-884-9104.
[00:23:39.351 --> 00:23:39.651]  That's 1-866-884-9104.
[00:24:06.385 --> 00:24:08.866]  Here's the deal.
[00:24:09.007 --> 00:24:12.568]  I have a lot of people walk up to me on the street and say they can never get in on the show.
[00:24:14.429 --> 00:24:16.590]  And I love some of our regular callers.
[00:24:17.771 --> 00:24:27.976]  But after I take this gamut, this run of calls, this clip of calls, I want first-time callers after that.
[00:24:30.357 --> 00:24:34.359]  As much as I love some of our regular callers, I want first-time callers today.
[00:24:35.111 --> 00:24:35.431]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:35.451 --> 00:24:45.313]  As soon as you hear us go to a caller and hang up on them, as soon as they disconnect, call in first-time callers.
[00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:45.894]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:45.914 --> 00:24:49.414]  Robert in Colorado.
[00:24:49.454 --> 00:24:50.095]  Robert, welcome.
[00:24:52.255 --> 00:24:52.535]  Hi.
[00:24:53.115 --> 00:24:54.075]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:24:54.115 --> 00:24:54.916]  Thanks for taking the call.
[00:24:54.936 --> 00:24:55.416]  I appreciate it.
[00:24:55.436 --> 00:24:58.256]  Man, I'm sorry I missed you on yours earlier last night.
[00:24:58.316 --> 00:24:59.217]  I forgot about that.
[00:24:59.557 --> 00:25:00.377]  I meant to listen.
[00:25:00.617 --> 00:25:01.477]  I slept through it, though.
[00:25:01.937 --> 00:25:02.818]  I bet I missed a good show.
[00:25:05.066 --> 00:25:09.827]  A couple weeks ago, you talked about Madison v. Marbury.
[00:25:11.487 --> 00:25:12.688]  Marbury v. Madison.
[00:25:13.048 --> 00:25:13.808]  I'm sorry, I had it wrong.
[00:25:14.488 --> 00:25:15.308]  Bring up Steve on that.
[00:25:15.408 --> 00:25:17.409]  I've heard of that case, but I'm not sure what's involved.
[00:25:17.509 --> 00:25:18.189]  What is that about?
[00:25:19.749 --> 00:25:24.750]  Well, any law that's in violation of the Constitution or the Bill of Rights is null and void.
[00:25:25.551 --> 00:25:27.531]  I overuse this example, but there's no better.
[00:25:28.686 --> 00:25:34.269]  If the Feds say blacks aren't human beings and have to report for slavery, the blacks don't have to follow that.
[00:25:34.309 --> 00:25:35.250]  It's totally criminal.
[00:25:35.550 --> 00:25:37.711]  And that government must be immediately removed.
[00:25:37.751 --> 00:25:41.593]  I mean, if the government declares itself God, it ain't God, folks.
[00:25:41.673 --> 00:25:42.914]  We have basic rights.
[00:25:44.294 --> 00:25:48.116]  Or like the new federal bankruptcy law that goes into effect on the 17th.
[00:25:48.136 --> 00:25:49.337]  That's another good example.
[00:25:50.174 --> 00:25:52.235]  Man, there's all... Look, everything's tightening down.
[00:25:52.355 --> 00:25:52.655]  Everything.
[00:25:52.816 --> 00:25:55.377]  They're about to pass a free speech law to restrict free speech.
[00:25:55.777 --> 00:25:58.999]  They're passing forced drugging laws, ID cards, martial law.
[00:25:59.579 --> 00:26:01.660]  I mean, it's happening, folks.
[00:26:01.901 --> 00:26:04.222]  Everything we talked about is now happening, Robert.
[00:26:04.262 --> 00:26:04.922]  Thanks for the call.
[00:26:05.342 --> 00:26:06.283]  Ron in New York.
[00:26:06.363 --> 00:26:07.083]  Ron, go ahead.
[00:26:07.103 --> 00:26:08.904]  Hello, Alex.
[00:26:09.084 --> 00:26:09.325]  Hi.
[00:26:09.785 --> 00:26:11.346]  I heard your interview last night.
[00:26:11.486 --> 00:26:15.628]  I have to say, you do a great job of investigative reporting with you and John Watson.
[00:26:15.648 --> 00:26:18.770]  Matter of fact, pretty soon I'm going to call you Sherlock Jones and Mr. Watson.
[00:26:19.907 --> 00:26:22.430]  That's how good a job of investigation you guys do.
[00:26:23.290 --> 00:26:28.515]  And there's certainly more free speech and democracy on your show than there probably is in this nation today.
[00:26:28.695 --> 00:26:30.217]  That's what I've come to a conclusion.
[00:26:30.938 --> 00:26:42.829]  I have noticed, Alex, the last two weeks, and maybe you've noticed this too, on like the neocon talk shows, radio, TV, they're circulating that Dick Morris, that little worm,
[00:26:43.678 --> 00:26:51.061]  And he's trying to weave a web of getting people used to the idea that the next election will be something like Condoleezza Rice versus Hillary.
[00:26:51.982 --> 00:26:53.883]  Those are the only viable choices that we have.
[00:26:54.103 --> 00:27:00.826]  And he's always worked for the Clintons, and he still does, and he's a chief political analyst for Fox News.
[00:27:01.166 --> 00:27:04.968]  Rupert Murdoch has lavish meals for four hours every week.
[00:27:06.141 --> 00:27:09.384]  Multiple New York papers have reported it's all staged.
[00:27:09.404 --> 00:27:09.945]  And you're right.
[00:27:10.325 --> 00:27:19.436]  Wormhead and the Republicans and the Bushes are now positioning Rice and that witch, I can't even say her name, Senator Clinton.
[00:27:20.111 --> 00:27:26.516]  Yeah, they're conditioning us to act as or think as though there are only two flavors in the national ice cream parlor.
[00:27:26.536 --> 00:27:27.037]  Well, you're right.
[00:27:27.057 --> 00:27:30.239]  I mean, Dick Morris just exudes shark-likeness.
[00:27:30.299 --> 00:27:32.521]  Little pointed teeth, little beady eyes.
[00:27:32.541 --> 00:27:36.064]  He's like a little piggy demon or something out of the Annie Manville horror.
[00:27:37.165 --> 00:27:38.346]  And this is what they're doing.
[00:27:38.466 --> 00:27:40.588]  But what I don't like is that the American people...
[00:27:41.388 --> 00:27:48.492]  ...tend to fall into this conditioning that they only think there's only two flavors, chocolate or vanilla, that there are no other flavors, nobody else... That's what they do!
[00:27:48.532 --> 00:27:50.613]  Listen, that's the old con artist game.
[00:27:50.653 --> 00:27:52.134]  Here's your choices, take it or leave it.
[00:27:52.294 --> 00:27:58.297]  When there's a whole spectrum, again, they give us false choices, limited choices, as if that's the full spectrum.
[00:27:59.558 --> 00:28:03.600]  You know, when it's not that, when they're not conditioning us, then it's the technology.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.722]  That report, what you did on Nuri last night, was great about the crude.
[00:28:07.462 --> 00:28:08.563]  And, you know...
[00:28:09.318 --> 00:28:20.648]  With the winter coming up, and I believe they anticipate fuel prices going up 50%, does the average American, as you said, all the beer in the world isn't going to drown the truth, does he understand the impact of that?
[00:28:21.268 --> 00:28:23.290]  Do they know how that's going to impact our lives?
[00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:24.191]  Of course they do.
[00:28:24.231 --> 00:28:34.660]  Listen, the Club of Rome and others openly say that we've had it too good, too long, and that they're going to bring us to our knees, but there are millions of people, literally on subsistence level...
[00:28:35.942 --> 00:28:42.044]  But they've got it set up now where if old people go on welfare to get help, the government just takes their house.
[00:28:42.084 --> 00:28:47.086]  So there'll be lots of land grabbing and property grabbing in this process.
[00:28:47.126 --> 00:28:48.706]  Thanks for the call, Ron.
[00:28:49.106 --> 00:28:50.127]  Jim in Michigan.
[00:28:50.167 --> 00:28:50.967]  Jim, go ahead.
[00:28:50.987 --> 00:28:52.508]  Hello, Alex.
[00:28:52.548 --> 00:28:53.308]  How are you today?
[00:28:53.488 --> 00:28:54.808]  Good, sir.
[00:28:55.008 --> 00:28:58.950]  I'm calling with regard to the weather modification idea.
[00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:01.711]  And you had just mentioned here this morning that...
[00:29:03.317 --> 00:29:06.619]  It's harder and harder to keep the truth quiet.
[00:29:06.719 --> 00:29:08.020]  It is getting out.
[00:29:08.821 --> 00:29:15.606]  And I just recently read a book of fiction by Sidney Sheldon called Are You Afraid of the Dark?
[00:29:16.306 --> 00:29:22.050]  And this is a book all about tyrants getting hold of a machine that can control the weather.
[00:29:22.650 --> 00:29:30.596]  But what's important in this book is that in the afterward, in the book he says every scenario that he used in that book
[00:29:31.548 --> 00:29:41.274]  A weather modification has been done and is being done by two major powers on the earth, the United States and Russia.
[00:29:42.055 --> 00:29:48.219]  And he says that they actually did a test several decades ago on it.
[00:29:48.239 --> 00:29:48.539]  Stay there.
[00:29:48.579 --> 00:29:49.379]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.361 --> 00:29:52.301]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.762 --> 00:29:54.363]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.283 --> 00:29:57.965]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.564 --> 00:30:05.045]  Sooner or later, we all have to face it.
[00:30:05.225 --> 00:30:09.168]  We live in dangerous times, and the more prepared we are, the better our chances are to survive them.
[00:30:09.448 --> 00:30:16.752]  The threat of a terrorist nuclear attack, a dirty bomb, or a nuclear power plant accident, or a nuclear waste spill is something we all face every day.
[00:30:17.032 --> 00:30:18.954]  That's why no family should be without the Nuke Alert.
[00:30:19.274 --> 00:30:26.038]  Small enough to fit on your keychain, the Nuke Alert monitors for dangerous radiation levels 24-7, and its long-life battery lasts for 10 years.
[00:30:26.358 --> 00:30:29.240]  It's made in the USA, and is individually accuracy-tested.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:34.964]  Your nuclear alert will let you know if you're entering a contaminated area or if you're being exposed to hazardous levels of radiation.
[00:30:35.224 --> 00:30:36.605]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:30:37.426 --> 00:30:42.170]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your nuclear alert today.
[00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:45.672]  Only $16 per year will protect your family for 10 years.
[00:30:46.012 --> 00:30:50.536]  And for a limited time, you'll also receive a CD-ROM with thousands of pages of preparedness information.
[00:30:50.796 --> 00:30:51.016]  Call 877-817-9829.
[00:30:53.879 --> 00:30:57.789]  That's 877-817-9829 and order your Nook Alert today.
[00:30:57.930 --> 00:30:58.371]  Nook Alert.
[00:30:58.672 --> 00:30:59.715]  Isn't your family worth it?
[00:31:01.227 --> 00:31:07.468]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.608 --> 00:31:13.769]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.049 --> 00:31:22.451]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.731 --> 00:31:29.732]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.052 --> 00:31:34.875]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:31:35.095 --> 00:31:40.499]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:31:40.839 --> 00:31:43.921]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:31:44.262 --> 00:31:52.247]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.267 --> 00:31:52.847]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:01.832 --> 00:32:04.973]  We understand that decisions related to health can be overwhelming.
[00:32:05.233 --> 00:32:12.016]  That is why at ResearchedHerbs.com we take pride in offering you herbs whose safety and effectiveness have been proven time and time again.
[00:32:12.476 --> 00:32:25.821]  For example, did you know that Live 52, the top-selling natural herbal supplement for liver diseases since 1930, is backed by over 300 research studies and clinical trials and prescribed by more than 200,000 health professionals worldwide?
[00:32:26.141 --> 00:32:29.883]  In fact, the effectiveness of all the herbs featured on ResearchedHerbs.com
[00:32:30.043 --> 00:32:30.263]  That's 1-800-845-3841.
[00:33:01.314 --> 00:33:03.536]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:33:03.556 --> 00:33:06.919]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.782 --> 00:33:14.685]  Jim, Rodney, Steve, Jay, Clay, many, many others.
[00:33:14.725 --> 00:33:24.933]  Your calls are coming up here in just about five minutes, and then I'm going to get back into all the talk of impeachment, all the talk of indictments, and open discussion of martial law.
[00:33:25.053 --> 00:33:27.235]  The president outside of Congress, outside of...
[00:33:27.876 --> 00:33:31.099]  The governors outside of the people, just, I am your ruler.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:40.527]  And, you know, long after Bush is gone, Hillary Clinton or Schwarzenegger or whoever our great fuhrer will be, they will have this criminal power.
[00:33:40.567 --> 00:33:43.309]  I mean, why do they make federal laws against it?
[00:33:43.369 --> 00:33:46.172]  Why does the Constitution speak out against it?
[00:33:46.232 --> 00:33:47.453]  There's a reason for this.
[00:33:49.105 --> 00:33:56.292]  And that's what I cover in my film, Martial Law 9-1-1, Rise of the Police State.
[00:33:56.772 --> 00:33:57.473]  What are we seeing?
[00:33:57.513 --> 00:34:02.757]  We're seeing martial law being openly pushed, being acclimated, and the rise of what?
[00:34:02.837 --> 00:34:04.699]  The rise of the police state.
[00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:07.181]  This is my penultimate film at this point.
[00:34:07.742 --> 00:34:09.624]  It's the best video I've ever made.
[00:34:10.004 --> 00:34:11.946]  It's a miniseries, three hours long.
[00:34:12.746 --> 00:34:15.209]  And I bemoan the fact that more people don't get it.
[00:34:15.329 --> 00:34:16.911]  I mean, you need to have this film.
[00:34:17.291 --> 00:34:20.214]  Big discounts when you get multiple copies of any of my documentaries.
[00:34:20.795 --> 00:34:24.899]  And your support obviously goes right into the fight against the globalists.
[00:34:24.939 --> 00:34:35.551]  And I can't think of any place out there where your support will go more towards the fight at literal point-blank range, muzzle-to-muzzle engagement of the enemy.
[00:34:36.204 --> 00:34:38.306]  I mean, we are ramming them, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:38.326 --> 00:34:39.287]  This was a sea battle.
[00:34:39.687 --> 00:34:50.115]  We are, you know, as Lord Wellington said... Actually, Lord Wellington was land-based.
[00:34:50.175 --> 00:34:52.297]  I haven't had much sleep, folks, about two hours.
[00:34:52.897 --> 00:34:54.719]  It was Lord Nelson.
[00:34:54.819 --> 00:34:56.020]  Damn the torpedoes.
[00:34:57.841 --> 00:34:59.903]  Or was it, damn the maneuvers, go straight at them.
[00:35:00.203 --> 00:35:01.764]  Somebody else said something else.
[00:35:02.064 --> 00:35:04.666]  I'm trying to go over my historical memory here, and it...
[00:35:06.369 --> 00:35:12.673]  My memory of history, it's failing me this morning after, again, nine and a half hours of broadcast yesterday.
[00:35:12.713 --> 00:35:16.116]  But you need to get martial law.
[00:35:16.136 --> 00:35:17.056]  You need to have this video.
[00:35:17.577 --> 00:35:23.360]  You can go to InfoWars.com to order it via the Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart or by calling toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:23.561]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:35:34.386 --> 00:35:43.576]  Or if you go to prisonplanet.tv, hundreds of my weekly TV reports and special video reports, just amazing information you won't see anywhere else.
[00:35:43.876 --> 00:35:55.249]  All of my films, dozens of other films, my book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other e-books, all of my best audio interviews, including the Ron Paul interview we just did a few days ago about martial law.
[00:35:56.434 --> 00:36:04.320]  And take my new film, 40-plus minutes, The Order of Death, detailing the new footage inside Bohemian Grove by our news source that worked there.
[00:36:06.342 --> 00:36:11.025]  Inside the owl, showing the sacrificial effigy up close, the skeletal remains.
[00:36:12.186 --> 00:36:14.148]  It's a metal skeleton.
[00:36:14.168 --> 00:36:15.629]  They burned the outside off of it.
[00:36:16.970 --> 00:36:19.171]  Just so much information in this new film.
[00:36:19.892 --> 00:36:20.813]  And it's an e-film.
[00:36:20.953 --> 00:36:25.096]  It's going to be up there for about a month before it's available on DVD and VHS.
[00:36:26.869 --> 00:36:34.033]  And you get a chance to see that by going to prisonplanet.tv right now.
[00:36:35.213 --> 00:36:38.475]  And so I hope you take action.
[00:36:38.515 --> 00:36:39.315]  I hope you get involved.
[00:36:39.335 --> 00:36:41.577]  I hope you join prisonplanet.tv as well.
[00:36:42.137 --> 00:36:45.078]  But really, everybody needs to see the film Martial Law.
[00:36:46.419 --> 00:36:51.942]  All right, before we get to your calls, another thing that people need to do is to realize that
[00:36:53.636 --> 00:37:02.824]  I don't have big murky water filters because I'm worried about floods or earthquakes or wildfires or contaminated water, you know, from some big event.
[00:37:04.385 --> 00:37:08.889]  I drink filtered water because I know what's currently in the water.
[00:37:08.989 --> 00:37:11.230]  I know about the invisible death that's in the water.
[00:37:12.051 --> 00:37:16.495]  The literal thousands of chemicals and toxins and herbicides and pesticides.
[00:37:16.895 --> 00:37:18.897]  The allowable amounts that are in there
[00:37:19.628 --> 00:37:25.913]  Turn your water into a toxic base, a toxic witch's brew.
[00:37:28.034 --> 00:37:33.499]  And I really hope that you'll take advantage of New Millennium's Made in America Big Berkey products.
[00:37:34.579 --> 00:37:38.382]  They are the national manufacturer and distributors, so you get the lowest prices.
[00:37:38.442 --> 00:37:43.066]  Again, Indian knockoffs cost on average $75 more.
[00:37:49.151 --> 00:37:52.732]  And you hold up their little elements in their little hollow nothings.
[00:37:52.752 --> 00:37:54.233]  You hold up a black Berkey element.
[00:37:54.773 --> 00:37:56.553]  It is, it is, it is substantive.
[00:37:56.593 --> 00:37:57.194]  It is thick.
[00:37:58.054 --> 00:37:58.914]  It is amazing.
[00:37:59.214 --> 00:38:01.615]  And it's been tested by major universities.
[00:38:01.655 --> 00:38:04.436]  A new standard in water purification.
[00:38:04.456 --> 00:38:08.797]  I mean, it takes it out to where it's non-detectable.
[00:38:08.837 --> 00:38:09.658]  And that's a new standard.
[00:38:09.978 --> 00:38:13.139]  And joining us for a few minutes is Debbie Morrow, New Millennium Concepts.
[00:38:14.795 --> 00:38:20.358]  If you call and they were busy during the hurricane, or the phones were always busy and you couldn't get through, call them now.
[00:38:20.718 --> 00:38:21.999]  Their phones are wide open.
[00:38:22.759 --> 00:38:25.460]  Give the Berkey as gifts or get replacement elements.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:28.141]  They have little sports bottles, too, that are excellent.
[00:38:28.181 --> 00:38:28.822]  Little filters.
[00:38:29.282 --> 00:38:30.302]  Very economical.
[00:38:30.923 --> 00:38:32.983]  This is what I give as a gift every Christmas.
[00:38:34.224 --> 00:38:35.365]  Debbie, thanks for joining us.
[00:38:35.565 --> 00:38:36.225]  Hi, Alex.
[00:38:36.305 --> 00:38:38.306]  Thank you very much for having me.
[00:38:38.746 --> 00:38:40.607]  I look forward to getting your video.
[00:38:42.216 --> 00:38:42.937]  Oh, the new film?
[00:38:42.957 --> 00:38:43.858]  The new one, yeah.
[00:38:43.898 --> 00:38:45.159]  It sounds really good.
[00:38:45.279 --> 00:38:50.444]  Well, it won't be out for about three weeks or so, but it is available right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:38:51.365 --> 00:38:54.669]  Debbie, people need to call you.
[00:38:54.729 --> 00:38:57.031]  They need to make the commitment to stop drinking the poison.
[00:38:57.611 --> 00:39:03.738]  Absolutely, and especially right now, our phone lines are more open than they've been in the last month.
[00:39:05.106 --> 00:39:14.937]  For the people who've been trying to get through and weren't able to, and for some reason we couldn't hook up, this is a great time to be able to get your orders in.
[00:39:16.018 --> 00:39:19.262]  We have more stocks coming in as we speak.
[00:39:19.342 --> 00:39:21.284]  We're getting restocked from the
[00:39:22.776 --> 00:39:37.618]  Uh, shortages that we were having during all the hurricanes and now we can make sure that people not only are having their Berkeys for times of distress but for every day because Berkey water filters really are for every single day.
[00:39:38.503 --> 00:39:48.713]  I was at Walmart yesterday, and there was a guy there who was filling up like 20-gallon things of water out of one of those machines, and I stopped and talked to him and exchanged numbers.
[00:39:49.053 --> 00:39:54.939]  Why haul water when you can be absolutely sure that you're having the best water made right in your own house?
[00:39:55.059 --> 00:39:56.220]  Well, this is a paradox.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:58.903]  Everybody knows that tap water isn't safe to drink.
[00:39:58.983 --> 00:40:02.186]  It tastes disgusting, even in cities that are rated as better than some.
[00:40:02.938 --> 00:40:24.988]  But why do people go to these purification units at the major stores when there's been press reports that if they don't replace the filters in those properly, it becomes highly toxic because at a certain saturation point it pours through and then you get the condensation of poisons and toxins from six months into your one gallon of water and you go home and drink it and literally drop dead.
[00:40:25.008 --> 00:40:25.988]  I mean, this has been in the news.
[00:40:26.028 --> 00:40:30.110]  Bottled water on average is more toxic and dirty and contaminated.
[00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:30.911]  This is mainstream news.
[00:40:30.931 --> 00:40:31.711]  Just type it into Google.
[00:40:33.272 --> 00:40:34.173]  Than tap water.
[00:40:34.553 --> 00:40:36.974]  I mean, these companies are a joke.
[00:40:37.014 --> 00:40:40.977]  You've got to take responsibilities for yourself.
[00:40:41.017 --> 00:40:42.238]  You've got responsibilities.
[00:40:42.578 --> 00:40:43.139]  It's a new word.
[00:40:43.399 --> 00:40:44.900]  Responsibility for yourselves.
[00:40:45.901 --> 00:40:47.902]  Do not let your children drink this trash.
[00:40:48.963 --> 00:40:50.344]  And stop being dependent.
[00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:51.204]  And I am preaching.
[00:40:51.705 --> 00:40:52.585]  I believe in this.
[00:40:53.586 --> 00:40:55.987]  And Debbie, how do folks give you a call?
[00:40:56.288 --> 00:40:58.009]  They can call me toll free at 1-888-
[00:41:00.137 --> 00:41:00.677]  Yes, that's right.
[00:41:26.383 --> 00:41:27.764]  You know, whatever applies to what they order.
[00:41:27.804 --> 00:41:35.369]  And that's a Sheltering in Place DVD about making your house safe from chemical and biological or a portable sports bottle that does 630 refills.
[00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:35.909]  Right.
[00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:43.214]  Or you can get the potassium iodate, which they've handed out to the feds, but not to the cities around nuclear power plants.
[00:41:44.015 --> 00:41:46.036]  Debbie, I really want to thank you for coming on with us.
[00:41:46.056 --> 00:41:49.898]  Thank you for having me, and I look forward to talking to your listeners.
[00:41:50.059 --> 00:41:50.379]  You bet.
[00:41:50.399 --> 00:41:50.959]  Thanks, Debbie.
[00:41:51.139 --> 00:41:53.261]  And by the way, side issue, but it ties into this.
[00:41:53.321 --> 00:41:55.122]  Last night I was looking on Drudge Report.
[00:41:56.021 --> 00:42:01.845]  And there was an ABC News report about, what, 40-something... I'm going from memory.
[00:42:01.865 --> 00:42:02.505]  I printed it off.
[00:42:02.545 --> 00:42:03.366]  It's here on the stack.
[00:42:04.507 --> 00:42:19.236]  Yeah, it was 40-something nuclear power plants on university campuses that nobody knows about and how they drove a rider truck right up at MIT to the giant reactor up there in Massachusetts.
[00:42:20.757 --> 00:42:22.178]  No security guards, no nothing.
[00:42:22.218 --> 00:42:24.780]  I mean, they got cops on the highway pulling you over going...
[00:42:25.450 --> 00:42:26.490]  We want to search your car.
[00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:27.131]  What's this for?
[00:42:27.231 --> 00:42:28.992]  It's pre-9, it's post-9-11.
[00:42:29.092 --> 00:42:29.612]  Shut up.
[00:42:30.372 --> 00:42:31.533]  But the border's wide open.
[00:42:32.413 --> 00:42:36.275]  And right here in Austin, I mean, there's nothing to stop you.
[00:42:36.315 --> 00:42:37.715]  You can just go up to the J.J.
[00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:43.277]  Pickle Research Laboratory, and they've got a substantive reactor.
[00:42:44.298 --> 00:42:50.140]  And, folks, every time I talk about this, I get some idiot email or somebody on the street going, there ain't no reactor, I know.
[00:42:50.721 --> 00:42:51.501]  Okay, bubba.
[00:42:52.542 --> 00:42:53.943]  I guess out of sight, out of mind.
[00:42:54.203 --> 00:42:56.443]  And again, they're in the moon that came up last night.
[00:42:58.684 --> 00:43:02.326]  I just don't know how to... The point is that these reactors are everywhere.
[00:43:02.686 --> 00:43:03.206]  And you know what?
[00:43:04.386 --> 00:43:05.166]  They're pretty safe.
[00:43:05.247 --> 00:43:07.267]  I mean, I'm not going to sit here and say they're not safe.
[00:43:07.967 --> 00:43:09.248]  I tend to like nuclear power.
[00:43:09.708 --> 00:43:12.509]  The point is that we're really under this terrorist threat.
[00:43:12.809 --> 00:43:18.151]  Why aren't they guarding these nuclear power plants that are all over the country?
[00:43:21.013 --> 00:43:23.353]  I mean, it's just an example of how dumbed down the public is.
[00:43:23.393 --> 00:43:24.994]  I've talked to cops here in Austin.
[00:43:25.034 --> 00:43:25.474]  Don't even know.
[00:43:25.494 --> 00:43:29.915]  We've got a pretty big... It's a good-sized reactor right here in North Austin.
[00:43:31.535 --> 00:43:35.236]  And I've totally even got another little one at UT downtown.
[00:43:36.336 --> 00:43:40.717]  But... I just got my headaches.
[00:43:40.737 --> 00:43:42.497]  I don't even know why I'm getting off into it.
[00:43:43.037 --> 00:43:45.638]  The point is that you need potassium iodate.
[00:43:45.698 --> 00:43:46.318]  The point is...
[00:43:47.293 --> 00:43:50.595]  You really do need to get the water filters and stop drinking the poison.
[00:43:50.615 --> 00:43:50.915]  888-803-4438.
[00:43:52.516 --> 00:43:54.537]  Write this number down.
[00:43:54.557 --> 00:43:58.220]  888-803-4438 or BerkeyWater.com.
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.440]  Now I'm going to shop about it.
[00:44:00.061 --> 00:44:03.883]  Let's go right back to Jim in Michigan, then Rodney, Steve, Jay, Clay, and others.
[00:44:03.923 --> 00:44:04.483]  Go ahead, Jim.
[00:44:05.004 --> 00:44:09.226]  By the way, I do have all your videos, Alex, and I want to say they are great.
[00:44:09.286 --> 00:44:11.868]  And there's another thing I haven't heard you mention about them.
[00:44:12.699 --> 00:44:13.059]  We're good to go.
[00:44:35.754 --> 00:44:39.457]  But we're on the road here, and we're really listening to the good information that you got.
[00:44:40.018 --> 00:44:53.628]  I was saying about Sidney Sheldon mentioning in the afterword of his book, Are You Afraid of the Dark?, that he claims that there was a test made in Wisconsin several decades back.
[00:44:54.769 --> 00:44:56.430]  I don't know whether this was the 50s, 60s, or what.
[00:44:58.177 --> 00:45:09.686]  But he said they generated winds of 175 miles an hour, caused $55 million in damage, and just a torrential amount of rain pour coming down.
[00:45:10.422 --> 00:45:25.933]  Now, if that information has been out long enough that authors who I do not know of to be plugged in to the circle of listeners that you have can get that information, then there must be ways.
[00:45:26.274 --> 00:45:28.856]  It was just mentioning how good your research team is.
[00:45:29.016 --> 00:45:31.257]  I don't know how to research something like that.
[00:45:31.558 --> 00:45:34.840]  Well, Jim, listen, I appreciate your call, but let me tell you how to do it.
[00:45:36.357 --> 00:45:54.240]  Twelve years ago when I first started getting involved, eleven years ago when I went on TV, ten years ago when I went on radio, we would have to go down to the library, and I'd go to the UT library, and I'd actually go into the stacks, and I'd do keyword searches in the microfilm on Henry Kissinger.
[00:45:55.561 --> 00:45:56.722]  Or on the Bilderberg Group.
[00:45:56.942 --> 00:46:07.552]  Or I would get newsletters of other people around the country that were doing similar research, and they would flag news articles and have photocopies of them, and then I could go check it out and do more research on it.
[00:46:08.993 --> 00:46:10.994]  And we'd be like, look, we've got another document!
[00:46:11.375 --> 00:46:16.159]  Here's where they admit they want to take our guns, or here's a plan to turn our groups over to the UN.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.421]  Here's another State Department document.
[00:46:20.393 --> 00:46:31.821]  And, you know, now, though, with things like Google and whole newspaper archives being put online and, you know, all this stuff happening, just type in Secretary of Defense Cohen weather modification comment.
[00:46:32.902 --> 00:46:34.904]  And you'll get the Army's official website.
[00:46:34.924 --> 00:46:44.751]  I mean, you can go to the Army's website and read about slave camps, how they built 12 camps and how Americans have secretly been on them since 1986 and they declassified in 97 and...
[00:46:47.333 --> 00:46:50.256]  And how they take federal prisoners to them to slave.
[00:46:50.316 --> 00:46:52.038]  I mean, I'm not kidding, folks.
[00:46:52.098 --> 00:46:57.223]  It's just bizarro stuff.
[00:46:58.064 --> 00:47:07.172]  I mean, the LA Times comes out with the article about, turns out blogs had actually gotten in, you know, with the oil companies ripping everybody off and shutting down refineries.
[00:47:07.713 --> 00:47:11.797]  Well, then you just Google it, and you go through, and you go to the government's own website, and there's all the memos.
[00:47:13.564 --> 00:47:16.166]  So, you know, research is everywhere.
[00:47:16.486 --> 00:47:21.469]  I mean, they just passed a law in the Senate to create a federal department of weather control.
[00:47:22.389 --> 00:47:26.492]  I mean, they've got weather channel specials, you know, about weather control.
[00:47:26.512 --> 00:47:27.713]  This is real stuff.
[00:47:29.073 --> 00:47:32.135]  So I don't blame some people for not having all the info.
[00:47:32.155 --> 00:47:33.176]  I mean, this is what I do.
[00:47:33.796 --> 00:47:41.461]  Or if some people are auto mechanics or some people are doctors or some people are roughnecks on oil rigs or some people are cops, this is what I do.
[00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:43.771]  And yes, I'm obsessed with it.
[00:47:43.811 --> 00:47:48.476]  I mean, literally, I just can't get enough of the truth, and I love knowing what's going on.
[00:47:48.496 --> 00:47:55.202]  And once you get more of the picture, it's like a jigsaw puzzle that you put more and more pieces in.
[00:47:55.222 --> 00:47:58.585]  It starts getting clearer and clearer and easier and easier.
[00:47:58.605 --> 00:48:04.210]  And we scientifically go about this.
[00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:06.572]  We don't try to prove the way we see the world.
[00:48:07.589 --> 00:48:09.190]  He's not even proving it anymore.
[00:48:09.210 --> 00:48:10.390]  They're just out in the open.
[00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:11.611]  We're going to take your guns.
[00:48:11.631 --> 00:48:12.551]  You're going to be our slaves.
[00:48:12.591 --> 00:48:13.471]  Ha ha, idiots.
[00:48:13.551 --> 00:48:14.492]  I mean, you know, idiots.
[00:48:15.052 --> 00:48:16.193]  We're going to poison you.
[00:48:16.233 --> 00:48:16.953]  Ha ha ha.
[00:48:16.973 --> 00:48:19.114]  I mean, we're going to kill you with cancer viruses.
[00:48:19.154 --> 00:48:19.654]  Ha ha ha.
[00:48:19.834 --> 00:48:24.136]  And then they do it, and just the general public go, I just can't believe it.
[00:48:24.256 --> 00:48:25.476]  I mean, here it is, you know.
[00:48:26.257 --> 00:48:27.717]  Let's talk to Rodney in Texas.
[00:48:27.757 --> 00:48:28.357]  Go ahead, Rodney.
[00:48:29.518 --> 00:48:30.898]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[00:48:30.918 --> 00:48:32.039]  Sure.
[00:48:32.459 --> 00:48:37.241]  First of all, I want to say that you did a commendable job last night, and I will admit
[00:48:37.907 --> 00:48:43.329]  I am a frequent caller and I don't think that's a bad thing because it helps me.
[00:48:43.349 --> 00:48:46.591]  Well, sure Rodney.
[00:48:47.251 --> 00:48:48.071]  You're not that frequent.
[00:48:48.091 --> 00:48:48.971]  You call about once a week.
[00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:50.992]  Some people try to call every day and see.
[00:48:51.032 --> 00:48:52.553]  Then we never get to all the new people.
[00:48:53.013 --> 00:48:53.233]  Right.
[00:48:53.873 --> 00:49:01.537]  I do it because it enables me to be able to turn around and speak with other talk shows that I call into.
[00:49:02.992 --> 00:49:08.021]  I know I have a larger listening audience and I'm able to present my facts in a more cogent way.
[00:49:08.602 --> 00:49:10.065]  What's on your mind, Rodney?
[00:49:10.586 --> 00:49:11.527]  But here's what I was...
[00:49:12.506 --> 00:49:24.717]  I wanted to say last night when you were talking about the scarcity, the artificial scarcity with the oil, I was hoping that you would mention the new scarcity that they're trying to create with the water.
[00:49:24.877 --> 00:49:26.478]  Can you speak on that, and I'll hang up.
[00:49:26.939 --> 00:49:29.721]  Well, thank you, Rodney, and we always love your call.
[00:49:29.761 --> 00:49:30.702]  You're always a great caller.
[00:49:30.722 --> 00:49:31.062]  Thank you.
[00:49:31.442 --> 00:49:36.407]  I was just saying, first-time callers today, because I noticed a bunch of callers calling in I knew.
[00:49:36.427 --> 00:49:36.507]  Look,
[00:49:41.830 --> 00:49:43.271]  Again, it is in our opinion.
[00:49:44.572 --> 00:49:49.115]  We have a population who doesn't know anything about politics, doesn't know what the three branches of government are.
[00:49:49.135 --> 00:49:51.476]  You know, most adults don't know what the three branches of government are.
[00:49:52.537 --> 00:49:53.037]  Much less.
[00:49:53.637 --> 00:49:56.739]  But they've got their opinion, though, about how things operate.
[00:49:57.620 --> 00:50:06.365]  And I'm not about to walk in to somebody that works on turbine propeller units for nuclear submarines and start telling them how it operates.
[00:50:07.085 --> 00:50:08.066]  They laugh at me.
[00:50:08.526 --> 00:50:11.108]  But there are people out there who know nothing about anything.
[00:50:11.616 --> 00:50:16.037]  Oh, that Alex Jones, he's full of propaganda.
[00:50:17.638 --> 00:50:19.858]  The IMF, the World Bank documents are public.
[00:50:20.318 --> 00:50:21.459]  Joseph Sickles went public.
[00:50:21.479 --> 00:50:22.099]  They've been released.
[00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:22.879]  They're chief economists.
[00:50:23.759 --> 00:50:26.260]  We have Club of Rome documents, CFR documents.
[00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:27.340]  They even brag about it.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:29.300]  I've heard them on NPR bragging.
[00:50:31.481 --> 00:50:35.502]  They are going to restrict water and tell you there's no water.
[00:50:35.562 --> 00:50:39.163]  And to do that, a few companies are buying it up to create a monopoly.
[00:50:41.013 --> 00:50:42.714]  And they're going to rip you off for fresh water.
[00:50:44.236 --> 00:50:47.558]  And they're propagandizing how there's no fresh water when all the evidence shows it's a fraud.
[00:50:48.159 --> 00:50:52.222]  So, yeah, everything's artificial scarcity, and they're just going to rape the daylights out of you on that.
[00:50:53.903 --> 00:50:59.428]  So, I could talk for five hours about that, you know, with water, metering wells, the rest of it.
[00:51:02.265 --> 00:51:05.108]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[00:51:05.388 --> 00:51:06.970]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:07.290 --> 00:51:11.975]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[00:51:12.315 --> 00:51:16.759]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:21.344]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[00:51:21.564 --> 00:51:22.044]  We're good to go.
[00:52:01.412 --> 00:52:08.938]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:09.198 --> 00:52:20.127]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.247 --> 00:52:20.687]  We're good to go.
[00:52:36.861 --> 00:52:37.362]  That's right.
[00:52:37.542 --> 00:52:44.649]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.949 --> 00:52:53.698]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.718 --> 00:52:54.198]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:03.243 --> 00:53:09.186]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:09.406 --> 00:53:11.667]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:11.867 --> 00:53:18.210]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:18.550 --> 00:53:19.210]  We're good to go.
[00:53:34.096 --> 00:53:34.496]  We're good to go.
[00:53:34.536 --> 00:53:35.077]  We're good to go.
[00:54:07.971 --> 00:54:10.552]  All right, let's really blast through your calls quickly.
[00:54:11.452 --> 00:54:14.873]  We'll take calls, of course, in the next hour or two when our guest is on about weather modification.
[00:54:15.633 --> 00:54:17.874]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Colorado.
[00:54:17.914 --> 00:54:18.554]  Go ahead, Steve.
[00:54:18.975 --> 00:54:20.115]  Yeah, hey, Alex.
[00:54:20.135 --> 00:54:22.096]  Yeah, once again, good job last night.
[00:54:22.836 --> 00:54:24.756]  Got a comment and then two questions.
[00:54:25.076 --> 00:54:36.180]  First of all, the comment is the Club of Rome put out a map back in the early 70s, I believe it was, of their breaking down the world into ten regions.
[00:54:36.756 --> 00:54:43.200]  And for those that are familiar with Revelation in the Bible, it talks about ten kingdoms.
[00:54:43.220 --> 00:54:44.281]  By the way, the U.S.
[00:54:44.321 --> 00:54:52.607]  was broken into ten FEMA regions under another name in what a 1937 New York Times article, front page spread that I actually own an original of.
[00:54:53.227 --> 00:54:56.229]  And then on top of it, it also has the earth in the ten regions.
[00:54:56.309 --> 00:55:00.192]  So they've never gone off the same plan that Cecil Rhodes drew up.
[00:55:01.052 --> 00:55:01.393]  Oh, I see.
[00:55:01.413 --> 00:55:03.194]  It goes back even to Cecil Rhodes, eh?
[00:55:03.434 --> 00:55:06.356]  And he's the guy with the Oppenheimers and the Diamond Monopoly.
[00:55:06.883 --> 00:55:09.064]  Okay, well, do you have a map on your website?
[00:55:09.084 --> 00:55:11.045]  Do you have any idea of that map?
[00:55:11.085 --> 00:55:13.506]  Yes, I actually have it somewhere.
[00:55:13.526 --> 00:55:15.607]  I actually have, like, two storage buildings.
[00:55:16.187 --> 00:55:20.449]  I have an entire huge folder full of that stuff.
[00:55:20.930 --> 00:55:21.170]  I see.
[00:55:21.210 --> 00:55:34.996]  Okay, because there was a book called En Route to Global Occupation that you've probably heard of that was written by Gary Ka that has a picture of that map and how the world is, they have broken it down into ten regions.
[00:55:35.076 --> 00:55:36.057]  Excellent publication.
[00:55:36.556 --> 00:55:39.198]  Yeah, and actually, that's what NAFTA is all about.
[00:55:39.298 --> 00:55:52.750]  NAFTA, which obviously is not going to be put out in the news media, is that NAFTA is actually... Well, actually, the CFR came out four months ago with a plan for the Pan-American Union, and it was immediately implemented by Mexico, the U.S., and Canada, and the Canadian papers decried the end of their sovereignty.
[00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:54.011]  Wow.
[00:55:54.471 --> 00:56:03.839]  Yeah, so anyway, NAFTA is one of the regions of the Ten Kingdoms breakdown by the Club of Rome, but... Well, it's actually three major blocks broken into ten regions.
[00:56:06.011 --> 00:56:07.273]  Yeah, okay, I see.
[00:56:07.293 --> 00:56:11.457]  But then the ten regions of the world where NAFTA is one of them.
[00:56:11.477 --> 00:56:13.620]  Yes, sir, I appreciate your call.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.762]  Can I ask you a couple of questions?
[00:56:16.302 --> 00:56:16.843]  Sure.
[00:56:17.564 --> 00:56:21.248]  First of all, after Katrina, when the families were relocated,
[00:56:22.275 --> 00:56:24.817]  Were the families actually separated?
[00:56:25.157 --> 00:56:30.439]  In other words, parents sent one place and kids sent another when they relocated them after Katrina?
[00:56:30.459 --> 00:56:34.301]  Yes, in some cases they were, especially in the first few days.
[00:56:34.381 --> 00:56:43.946]  If they wouldn't give them aid for four or five in the first few days, they would randomly just split families up and fly them one place, fly them another, and then it would take weeks to reunite them.
[00:56:45.867 --> 00:56:47.488]  Evidently, if I remember right, Andrew,
[00:56:47.978 --> 00:56:57.849]  Yeah, you can read those executive orders on the Library of Congress website.
[00:56:57.869 --> 00:57:01.413]  But again, just because the government claims it's God doesn't mean it's so.
[00:57:01.433 --> 00:57:02.093]  Good to hear from you.
[00:57:02.474 --> 00:57:03.455]  I appreciate your call.
[00:57:04.096 --> 00:57:05.037]  Good to hear from you there.
[00:57:05.817 --> 00:57:07.539]  Let's go to Jay in California.
[00:57:07.579 --> 00:57:08.260]  Jay, go ahead.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:08.821]  Thank you.
[00:57:09.381 --> 00:57:18.846]  If it were allowed to continue, the free flow of genuine information such as occurs on your program and others would eventually win back our country and bring the New World Order down.
[00:57:19.407 --> 00:57:22.688]  So they have developed a new weapon for themselves to stop this.
[00:57:22.708 --> 00:57:27.091]  It's called the Hate Crimes Act, which is getting ready to pass the Senate.
[00:57:27.971 --> 00:57:34.555]  And they will be coming at all truth broadcasters with this weapon, this axe.
[00:57:35.166 --> 00:57:36.408]  As hard as they can.
[00:57:37.789 --> 00:57:39.151]  Let's be honest about this act.
[00:57:39.211 --> 00:57:39.672]  I've read it.
[00:57:40.172 --> 00:57:41.634]  It is a violation of free speech.
[00:57:41.694 --> 00:57:46.100]  It does federalize these mind control actions, these thought crimes.
[00:57:46.901 --> 00:57:48.982]  But it is not the end-all, be-all.
[00:57:49.022 --> 00:58:02.489]  By saying this is the end, in a way it's actually crying wolf, because then it won't be the end, and then people will go, oh, well, it wasn't the end, but it's one more big step towards it, and it shows us what they want to do.
[00:58:02.929 --> 00:58:12.954]  I had just prayed that GCN and others, the people that run these great organizations, are building a self-defense strategy for themselves, because it's certain that
[00:58:13.636 --> 00:58:16.418]  All will come under attack as the pressure grows, sir.
[00:58:16.458 --> 00:58:17.539]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:58:17.559 --> 00:58:17.979]  Bless you.
[00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:19.140]  No, thank you for the call.
[00:58:19.460 --> 00:58:20.601]  It's already happening.
[00:58:20.641 --> 00:58:25.285]  I mean, you know, they're already trying to restrict and control the web, Internet 2, all of it.
[00:58:26.145 --> 00:58:31.249]  And, I mean, they arrested a whole bunch of Christians last year for praying.
[00:58:31.329 --> 00:58:33.591]  I mean, tried to put them in jail for 47 years.
[00:58:33.631 --> 00:58:34.432]  That's George Bush.
[00:58:35.072 --> 00:58:38.915]  But he says that Mrs. Myers is born again, so everything's okay.
[00:58:40.934 --> 00:58:45.578]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNlive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[00:58:57.151 --> 00:58:57.792]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.472 --> 00:58:59.513]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.233 --> 00:59:01.354]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:01.994 --> 00:59:02.815]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.575 --> 00:59:04.536]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:04.976 --> 00:59:09.099]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.319 --> 00:59:13.441]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:14.642 --> 00:59:18.705]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central Standard Time, back from 9 to Midnight Central.
[00:59:18.725 --> 00:59:23.548]  Coming up, Ben Livingston, a lot of physicists, his eye on hurricane control.
[00:59:24.804 --> 00:59:27.145]  You want to talk to a real expert from the inside?
[00:59:27.165 --> 00:59:29.567]  This is Dwarf, some of the other people that have been on air.
[00:59:31.048 --> 00:59:33.749]  Just wait until you hear this coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:59:34.690 --> 00:59:36.410]  Let's jam in a few more calls here.
[00:59:36.450 --> 00:59:38.832]  I'm trying, making a good effort at getting everybody.
[00:59:39.372 --> 00:59:40.853]  Clay, you're on the air.
[00:59:40.873 --> 00:59:42.134]  Where are you calling us from, Clay?
[00:59:42.714 --> 00:59:44.635]  I'm calling from Charlotte, North Carolina.
[00:59:44.815 --> 00:59:45.395]  Welcome, sir.
[00:59:45.415 --> 00:59:47.096]  Hi, Alex.
[00:59:47.156 --> 00:59:48.517]  I just wanted to call in.
[00:59:48.537 --> 00:59:50.498]  I heard you talking about Prozac yesterday.
[00:59:51.319 --> 00:59:53.300]  And I have a personal experience that...
[00:59:54.488 --> 00:59:55.889]  Basically I almost ruined my life.
[00:59:56.069 --> 01:00:03.732]  I went on Prozac for clinical depression and basically one day I woke up and I was in jail.
[01:00:03.752 --> 01:00:07.714]  I basically went crazy.
[01:00:08.614 --> 01:00:09.555]  I wrecked a car.
[01:00:09.955 --> 01:00:11.736]  I took my father's gun with me.
[01:00:11.756 --> 01:00:13.016]  I had about 400 bullets.
[01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:15.878]  I have no idea why.
[01:00:17.097 --> 01:00:18.198]  We're good to go.
[01:00:37.891 --> 01:00:51.438]  And, no, women dancing around naked on top of houses with butcher knives is routine, cutting their children's arms and legs off, drowning their children, cutting themselves, flopping around the ground, troops coming home and killing their whole families.
[01:00:51.538 --> 01:00:52.538]  This is what it does.
[01:00:54.339 --> 01:00:57.741]  You better just be glad you didn't start shooting at cops and get your head blown off.
[01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:03.552]  Well, it took six of them to get me into the jail from what I've heard, and they tasered me repeatedly.
[01:01:04.172 --> 01:01:04.572]  I guess I'm lucky.
[01:01:04.592 --> 01:01:08.714]  Well, yeah, because that stuff is the equivalent of PCP when you have a bad trip.
[01:01:09.695 --> 01:01:17.359]  But I'm no longer going to take anything like that, of course, and I'm fine with just exercising, changing my diet.
[01:01:17.379 --> 01:01:18.820]  So what happened?
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:19.680]  You got a little bit depressed?
[01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.701]  They said, oh, just take this, no big deal.
[01:01:22.281 --> 01:01:25.303]  It took them about 15 minutes to decide to give me that, I think.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:27.961]  But I do want to say one more thing.
[01:01:28.422 --> 01:01:44.996]  I do have your video, Marshall Law, and I have a sister who is a big-time Bush lover, and I showed her that, and I think she's definitely coming around, and it's changed her mind, and I'm very grateful for all that you're doing.
[01:01:45.197 --> 01:01:48.159]  Well, thank you, sir, and I'll thank you for your support and take care.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:52.203]  Look, if you attack George Bush as a liberal,
[01:01:53.149 --> 01:01:57.232]  If you come out and go, I'm a liberal, he's an evil right-winger, no one's going to listen to you.
[01:01:58.172 --> 01:02:09.040]  But if you come at things from the truth and expose how both parties are controlled, how we're losing our freedoms, and how Bush is just a puppet, then conservatives will listen.
[01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:12.882]  I mean, Bush has gone too far with this Myers business.
[01:02:14.924 --> 01:02:16.064]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:02:16.164 --> 01:02:17.345]  Bush is a puppet.
[01:02:17.365 --> 01:02:18.486]  He'll take all the heat.
[01:02:19.474 --> 01:02:21.836]  People who think he's the end-all, be-all, you just don't understand.
[01:02:22.156 --> 01:02:25.399]  It won't matter if it's Hillary or Swartzy or who it is.
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.543]  It doesn't matter who it is.
[01:02:31.124 --> 01:02:34.527]  They're going to follow the agenda, or they're going to end up like Kennedy, real fast.
[01:02:35.808 --> 01:02:42.554]  And so Bush may be a political sacrificial lamb, and I'm not going to sit here and have a victory party if he gets impeached or removed.
[01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.197]  Because if it happens, it'll be engineered.
[01:02:46.477 --> 01:02:48.159]  I mean, if it happens, it was meant to happen that way.
[01:02:48.179 --> 01:02:49.960]  They're just flushing their puppet.
[01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:54.784]  Now, if they don't want him to be impeached and something happens, you can look for serious fireworks.
[01:02:55.664 --> 01:02:58.106]  But I tend to lean towards the first scenario.
[01:03:00.131 --> 01:03:03.973]  So, you know, they get us into this raw, raw sports team mentality.
[01:03:04.033 --> 01:03:04.814]  I'm for the Democrats.
[01:03:04.874 --> 01:03:05.695]  I'm for the Republicans.
[01:03:05.795 --> 01:03:06.755]  I'm against the Republicans.
[01:03:07.115 --> 01:03:08.056]  I'm against the Democrats.
[01:03:08.136 --> 01:03:10.417]  And then the thinking process is switched off.
[01:03:10.457 --> 01:03:14.860]  Listen, I don't owe one grain of allegiance to a political party.
[01:03:15.260 --> 01:03:16.841]  I owe it to the Constitution.
[01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:19.203]  The Bill of Rights has kept us in good stead.
[01:03:20.083 --> 01:03:25.727]  And it is the politicians in both parties that are systematically dismantling
[01:03:27.177 --> 01:03:30.058]  The foundation of this country.
[01:03:30.138 --> 01:03:30.719]  And you know what?
[01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:31.499]  I'm going to defend it.
[01:03:32.259 --> 01:03:34.780]  From Hillary Clinton or George Bush, I don't care.
[01:03:35.420 --> 01:03:42.283]  We'll talk about weather control, weather modification with one of the premier experts in the country who's now speaking out, Ben Livingston.
[01:03:42.863 --> 01:03:45.764]  On the other side of this quick break, you'll want to stay with us.
[01:03:46.825 --> 01:03:50.066]  The websites are Infowars.com and Infowars.net.
[01:03:53.675 --> 01:03:56.617]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.278 --> 01:03:58.579]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:58.779 --> 01:04:04.504]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:04.784 --> 01:04:10.048]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:10.329 --> 01:04:11.950]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order...
[01:04:12.090 --> 01:04:13.590]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:04:32.015 --> 01:04:34.117]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyrion today.
[01:04:34.197 --> 01:04:36.799]  Call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.603]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:45.727]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:04:45.827 --> 01:04:47.829]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:49.591]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:49.771 --> 01:04:51.813]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:04:52.648 --> 01:04:57.949]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones introducing you to the incredible Berkey Solar Charger.
[01:04:58.169 --> 01:05:00.230]  Your source for free solar electricity.
[01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:07.591]  This portable system is the size of a book when folded and small enough to fit into a briefcase, handbag, or glove compartment.
[01:05:07.711 --> 01:05:19.234]  The Berkey Solar Charger has been designed to power the Berkey lights, LED lamps, as well as other applications such as mobile phones, radios, digital cameras, and PDAs when electricity is unavailable.
[01:05:19.574 --> 01:05:20.215]  We're good to go.
[01:05:20.275 --> 01:05:20.955]  We're good to go.
[01:05:49.394 --> 01:05:51.455]  Back in the 1950s, gasoline was only 25 cents a gallon.
[01:05:51.475 --> 01:05:52.195]  A hot dog was a nickel.
[01:05:52.535 --> 01:05:53.236]  And a luxury car was only 3,000 bucks.
[01:05:53.256 --> 01:05:54.156]  What happened to those prices?
[01:05:54.176 --> 01:05:55.477]  Well, the dollar was changed.
[01:06:07.242 --> 01:06:13.206]  In the 1960s, the government removed silver from the dollar and just started printing money out of thin air.
[01:06:13.666 --> 01:06:14.207]  The result?
[01:06:14.647 --> 01:06:15.908]  Inflation was born.
[01:06:16.408 --> 01:06:19.891]  Your dollar has lost 96% of its purchasing power.
[01:06:20.471 --> 01:06:21.352]  What can you do about it?
[01:06:21.772 --> 01:06:24.094]  Start using the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[01:06:24.914 --> 01:06:30.255]  The Silver Liberty Dollar is a private legal currency backed by 100% pure silver.
[01:06:30.675 --> 01:06:35.857]  It's 100% inflation-proof and is being used by over 100,000 people.
[01:06:36.297 --> 01:06:38.797]  Beat inflation with the Silver Liberty Dollar.
[01:06:39.257 --> 01:06:45.159]  Visit www.libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR.
[01:06:45.639 --> 01:06:47.939]  That's libertydollar.org or call 1-800-NEW-DOLLAR now.
[01:06:52.725 --> 01:06:57.769]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:58.149 --> 01:07:00.471]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:00.491 --> 01:07:11.659]  You know, a lot of people think things don't exist that have existed for decades, but just because they're not aware of it, they don't make it exist.
[01:07:12.500 --> 01:07:13.821]  It's like abiotic oil.
[01:07:14.822 --> 01:07:17.764]  Petroleum geologists will tell you that a lot of oil is abiotic.
[01:07:17.804 --> 01:07:20.045]  That is, it didn't come from dead animals.
[01:07:20.205 --> 01:07:22.087]  But because the general public isn't aware of it,
[01:07:22.597 --> 01:07:24.019]  They think it's a conspiracy theory.
[01:07:24.059 --> 01:07:30.088]  Well, they've had weather channel shows about government weather control and Vietnam War.
[01:07:30.108 --> 01:07:38.100]  We've got Secretary of Defense Cohen talking about it being a wave of the future in 1997 in a Defense Department Pentagon briefing.
[01:07:39.086 --> 01:07:45.813]  We have Kay Bailey Hutchinson getting a Senate bill passed to create a federal department of weather modification and control.
[01:07:45.853 --> 01:07:50.197]  We have a 1975 UN treaty on weather modification.
[01:07:50.237 --> 01:08:02.408]  On the 60th anniversary of the Russian victory against the Russian takeover of Berlin and the eagle's nest, the viper's nest, they cleared the skies when it was raining.
[01:08:02.428 --> 01:08:03.269]  I mean, that was in the BBC.
[01:08:04.272 --> 01:08:12.818]  But still, every time we mention weather control or have Scott Stevens on or some other meteorologist, people just can't believe it's real, that it's possible.
[01:08:13.298 --> 01:08:19.903]  You have primitive things like cloud shooting, which also have these antenna arrays and ways to manipulate the weather.
[01:08:19.923 --> 01:08:22.044]  It definitely is going on.
[01:08:22.124 --> 01:08:23.105]  We just had a hurricane.
[01:08:24.226 --> 01:08:25.588]  Hit Spain.
[01:08:26.168 --> 01:08:35.177]  Never in thousands of years in recorded history has the Iberian Peninsula been hit by a tropical storm, much less a hurricane.
[01:08:35.217 --> 01:08:37.299]  So, a lot of weird stuff going on.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.121]  This is amazing.
[01:08:40.141 --> 01:08:43.524]  This is his first interview concerning weather modification on radio.
[01:08:43.785 --> 01:08:49.470]  He was interviewed, because of increased interest in this, by the Midland Reporter-Telegram, the paper out in Midland, Texas.
[01:08:50.399 --> 01:08:56.441]  And believe me, Ben Livingston now is going to be in popular demand on talk radio.
[01:08:57.021 --> 01:08:59.402]  I'd expect that Coast to Coast AM will want to have him on.
[01:08:59.822 --> 01:09:04.683]  Ben Livingston, cloud physicist, has eye on hurricane control.
[01:09:04.703 --> 01:09:06.024]  He'll be joining us in about two minutes.
[01:09:06.984 --> 01:09:10.465]  Waylon Ben Livingston knows his ideas are controversial.
[01:09:11.525 --> 01:09:13.826]  So he steps lightly when talking about them.
[01:09:14.167 --> 01:09:15.667]  His theories have been proven.
[01:09:15.707 --> 01:09:17.208]  The technology is in place.
[01:09:17.548 --> 01:09:22.331]  Research shows his ideas could save hundreds, maybe even thousands of lives.
[01:09:22.891 --> 01:09:30.376]  He is a fascinating man with credentials as long as the wingspan of the airplanes he flew as a commander with the U.S.
[01:09:30.456 --> 01:09:32.557]  Navy in Korea and Vietnam.
[01:09:33.037 --> 01:09:33.597]  Livingston, 77.
[01:09:35.416 --> 01:09:38.157]  Moved to Midland with his parents during the Depression.
[01:09:38.197 --> 01:09:47.859]  He earned his master's degree in cloud physics from the Naval Weapons Center and Navy Postgraduate School in California, a degree he would use in the battlefields.
[01:09:48.539 --> 01:09:57.401]  He seeded clouds and dramatically increased rainfall in the theater of war, creating impassable, muddy roads, slowing down Vietnamese and Korean troops.
[01:09:57.821 --> 01:10:00.441]  And when you see the Weather Channel special, folks, this is who they're talking about.
[01:10:00.861 --> 01:10:04.262]  And saving lives in entire towns from occupation.
[01:10:06.084 --> 01:10:15.105]  He is proudest of the award from the Secretary of the Navy, which says Lieutenant Livingston directly participated in project flights in the combat zone.
[01:10:15.936 --> 01:10:32.381]  In program planning, scientific data collection, and evaluation, his unwavering devotion to duty were major factors in the outstanding success of the project and were instrumental in the development of unique major combat capability for the United States.
[01:10:32.421 --> 01:10:43.344]  Before receiving the citation, Livingston was invited to the White House where he briefed President Lyndon Baines Johnson on the effectiveness of weather control activities and the resulting results.
[01:10:43.784 --> 01:10:53.207]  Slowing of traffic by the military support trucks bringing supplies to southwest Asian cribs and, of course, the Ho Chi Minh Trail, I would add.
[01:10:54.187 --> 01:11:00.189]  Livingston's findings deal with hurricanes and what scientists call weather modifications.
[01:11:01.210 --> 01:11:10.493]  His research includes 265 missions into the eyes of hurricanes, and he calls himself maybe the most distinguished person in the country about Hurricane Katrina.
[01:11:12.153 --> 01:11:14.456]  The most disgusted, not the most distinguished.
[01:11:15.036 --> 01:11:21.783]  And again, folks, I mean, he dwarfs any knowledge out there of people out currently talking about weather modification.
[01:11:22.204 --> 01:11:26.348]  The storm, he says simply, could have been dramatically curtailed, but damage minimized.
[01:11:26.768 --> 01:11:28.690]  The levees of New Orleans saved.
[01:11:28.791 --> 01:11:32.835]  Livingston works with scientists and pilots at the Weather Modification, Inc.,
[01:11:33.235 --> 01:11:37.859]  In Fargo, North Dakota, his theories also have been verified by staffers there.
[01:11:38.259 --> 01:11:51.010]  He has logged 15,000 hours of hurricane reconnaissance experience, and all of his penetrations into the eye of hurricanes were on the low-level variety, where he would fly in from low altitude, then up into the eye.
[01:11:51.470 --> 01:11:58.195]  He said the refraction of the light into the water through the eye of the hurricane is the most beautiful and memorable sight he has ever witnessed.
[01:11:58.235 --> 01:11:58.736]  And it goes on.
[01:11:59.585 --> 01:12:15.655]  And he talks about, folks, 1960s national priority of our government was hurricane control, and he said, but then suddenly everything was shut down, mysteriously dropped, but that's because it went totally black project, as we know, ladies and gentlemen, from our Pentagon sources.
[01:12:15.695 --> 01:12:16.676]  Without further ado...
[01:12:17.336 --> 01:12:18.637]  There's many other revelations.
[01:12:18.677 --> 01:12:21.478]  We're honored to be joined by Waylon or Ben Livingston.
[01:12:21.878 --> 01:12:23.318]  Ben, good to have you on with us, sir.
[01:12:23.658 --> 01:12:24.319]  Thank you, sir.
[01:12:24.459 --> 01:12:25.099]  Good to be here.
[01:12:25.379 --> 01:12:25.919]  You bet.
[01:12:26.139 --> 01:12:36.783]  Any areas of the bio that need to be filled in, please tell us and then break down weather modification for us and your lifetime experience on this.
[01:12:39.264 --> 01:12:45.967]  Well, the only point I would make or want to emphasize right now is, of course, that we have had for...
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:58.269]  Several years the technology, the materials and the people with sufficient education and training and so forth to do a credible hurricane damage reduction program.
[01:13:00.511 --> 01:13:08.317]  But we seem not to get any response from our elected officials when we correspond with them and for that reason
[01:13:09.972 --> 01:13:17.196]  I'm trying to make, if you will, a contact with just plain people that understand the difference between talk and production.
[01:13:18.977 --> 01:13:25.481]  Well, I mean, you've actually created storms as far back as Vietnam yourself.
[01:13:27.962 --> 01:13:30.443]  So if you can create them, you can certainly deflect them.
[01:13:30.483 --> 01:13:32.845]  Let's jump right into the thick of it.
[01:13:33.305 --> 01:13:38.828]  How would you reduce or redirect, say, a Category 4 hurricane?
[01:13:41.064 --> 01:13:58.798]  Well, the thing that's not common knowledge to most people is that a hurricane is made up of a large number of energy cells, and each of those energy cells add to the ferocity, if you will, of the hurricane.
[01:14:00.279 --> 01:14:10.287]  It was proven in 1974 by an international project that these energy cells exist, and they are the reason that hurricanes can develop
[01:14:11.073 --> 01:14:13.335]  And grow, move, and cause damages.
[01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:38.773]  So that there's no reason to attack the hurricane in total, but just to fly in the right front quadrant, primarily, relative to the direction the storm's moving, and see those energy cells that are converging or making the rain and the wind velocities increase in the front part of a hurricane.
[01:14:39.542 --> 01:14:52.348]  So our plan would be, this is completely different than the operations in Vietnam in my commercial weather operations, a company I owned for several years and operated.
[01:14:53.889 --> 01:15:07.075]  But we would be trying to destroy, or at least grossly reduce the velocity
[01:15:08.559 --> 01:15:10.500]  In these individual energy cells.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:20.003]  And we would do that by seeding the clouds with silver iodide in the top part of the cloud, say above the minus six degrees centigrade level.
[01:15:20.743 --> 01:15:27.865]  And those tops then would have so many small droplets in them that the prevailing wind would just blow them away.
[01:15:27.885 --> 01:15:33.887]  And so the energy cell would be neutralized until it could regroup, which may be several hours later.
[01:15:34.628 --> 01:15:46.934]  So basically, in layman's terms, send in squadrons of planes to chemicalize in the proper strata of the hurricane, reducing or redirecting its power.
[01:15:47.194 --> 01:15:47.714]  Oh, no, sir.
[01:15:47.754 --> 01:15:49.735]  We would not send squadrons of airplanes in.
[01:15:49.755 --> 01:15:51.436]  We would send one or two at the most.
[01:15:51.636 --> 01:15:52.436]  That's all it would take.
[01:15:52.476 --> 01:15:52.996]  At a time.
[01:15:53.356 --> 01:15:54.117]  That's all it would take.
[01:15:54.137 --> 01:15:54.677]  That's right.
[01:15:54.717 --> 01:15:58.619]  We're carrying more cloud seeding material on one airplane now.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:04.382]  Over 800% more on each airplane than we had during Project Storm Fury.
[01:16:04.702 --> 01:16:06.303]  Okay, again, I'm no meteorologist.
[01:16:06.323 --> 01:16:07.123]  That's what I've read.
[01:16:07.163 --> 01:16:08.824]  In the past, it took quite a few planes.
[01:16:08.864 --> 01:16:11.985]  But you're saying now, what are the chemicals different, or what's happening?
[01:16:14.326 --> 01:16:17.007]  They're about the same efficiency now as they were in 1965.
[01:16:19.368 --> 01:16:21.769]  There are different size and shape, if you will.
[01:16:22.370 --> 01:16:27.812]  But the big difference is the number of generating...
[01:16:30.037 --> 01:16:45.902]  These flares generate silver iodide crystals, if you will, but we can take about 800% more on each airplane than we had in Vietnam or in the Project Storm 3 things in the 1960s.
[01:16:46.262 --> 01:16:51.364]  So instead of taking a whole bunch of planes, it just takes a few?
[01:16:51.524 --> 01:16:57.186]  We can take one airplane that runs two or three times faster than the airplanes we had before,
[01:16:57.921 --> 01:17:00.623]  And only have one aircraft on station at a time.
[01:17:01.284 --> 01:17:04.586]  Sir, this has got to, I mean, as you say in the newspaper, make you really mad.
[01:17:04.606 --> 01:17:06.628]  I mean, you ran operations in Vietnam.
[01:17:06.668 --> 01:17:08.630]  You flooded them in feet of water.
[01:17:08.670 --> 01:17:10.711]  I mean, that's even on the Weather Channel.
[01:17:11.652 --> 01:17:16.936]  This is amazing, and the government knows they could do this, but why didn't they do anything about it?
[01:17:18.397 --> 01:17:19.899]  This is a long story.
[01:17:20.039 --> 01:17:21.200]  It has a deep history.
[01:17:22.761 --> 01:17:24.162]  Way back in the mid-50s, in 1954 or so,
[01:17:26.843 --> 01:17:36.831]  The government allotted the first money for weather modification or weather control practices to the US Weather Bureau to the tune of about $30 million for that one year.
[01:17:37.671 --> 01:17:50.862]  But their charge was to employ the most brilliant scientists around the world, meteorologists and physicists, if you will, to work out a concept for reducing damages from hurricanes.
[01:17:53.098 --> 01:17:53.218]  Noah!
[01:18:21.503 --> 01:18:23.504]  To take that responsibility.
[01:18:25.324 --> 01:18:26.384]  We've got a break, sir.
[01:18:26.404 --> 01:18:27.565]  I don't know where to start.
[01:18:27.645 --> 01:18:30.025]  I mean, this is such a wellspring of knowledge.
[01:18:30.066 --> 01:18:31.186]  We're so honored to have you.
[01:18:31.806 --> 01:18:37.608]  Ladies and gentlemen, he ran weather wars, weather attacks on the North Vietnamese communists.
[01:18:38.248 --> 01:18:43.989]  And he's here telling you one or two planes knocking out Hurricane Katrina and Rita.
[01:18:44.029 --> 01:18:44.870]  But no!
[01:18:45.570 --> 01:18:46.650]  Nothing's done about it.
[01:18:47.270 --> 01:18:49.271]  This is the patented, demonstrated...
[01:18:50.177 --> 01:18:51.499]  Decades old technology.
[01:18:52.980 --> 01:18:58.627]  Did you know there is an easy and inexpensive way for you to look and feel better in less than 30 days?
[01:18:58.787 --> 01:19:04.794]  You can lose excess weight, have more energy, sleep better, and be mentally on top of your game without even trying.
[01:19:04.814 --> 01:19:08.558]  This is not about vitamins or the latest nutritional wonder product.
[01:19:08.598 --> 01:19:09.760]  We've all had enough of those.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.760]  I'm talking about God's pure whole foods.
[01:19:12.800 --> 01:19:15.601]  When you consume them, you look and feel better automatically.
[01:19:15.721 --> 01:19:21.842]  And thanks to URI International, you don't have to endure tasteless food or the expense and hassle of juicing.
[01:19:21.962 --> 01:19:31.984]  Using biblical farming standards and 21st century technology, URI grows, harvests, and prepares God's whole foods in pure powder form to protect and lock in their nutrients.
[01:19:32.144 --> 01:19:39.365]  URI ships this powder from the farm right to your doorstep so you can conveniently consume it either in delicious drinks or veggie caps.
[01:19:39.585 --> 01:19:39.866]  That's 888-224-7416.
[01:19:53.274 --> 01:19:56.156]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[01:19:56.516 --> 01:19:59.378]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[01:19:59.618 --> 01:20:05.802]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[01:20:06.182 --> 01:20:13.507]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[01:20:13.687 --> 01:20:17.750]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:54.141]  Currency devaluation, inflation, one and the same.
[01:20:54.222 --> 01:20:58.664]  If you have deposited $100,000 in a bank at 1% in a 30-month period dating from May 24, 2005, here is what happened to your funds.
[01:21:12.614 --> 01:21:15.735]  The dollar lost 33% of its value in that time frame.
[01:21:15.995 --> 01:21:17.836]  The bank paid you 1%.
[01:21:18.076 --> 01:21:21.918]  Your $100,000 now has a net purchasing power of $68,000.
[01:21:22.798 --> 01:21:23.678]  Here is reality.
[01:21:24.058 --> 01:21:27.640]  The devaluation of currency equals real inflation.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:31.781]  Keep in mind how the value of your paper assets are measured in dollars.
[01:21:32.342 --> 01:21:34.923]  Gold in the same time frame increased 35% in value.
[01:21:36.508 --> 01:21:36.728]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:21:52.737 --> 01:21:56.119]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:21:56.359 --> 01:21:56.679]  Why?
[01:21:56.699 --> 01:21:59.641]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[01:21:59.741 --> 01:22:04.663]  Cardivite drops and capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[01:22:39.967 --> 01:22:41.768]  Beat the odds and do your body right with Cardivite.
[01:23:03.639 --> 01:23:11.340]  We're talking to Ben Livingston, veteran, ran entire operations at Vietnam, successfully flooding the enemy.
[01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:14.761]  And if you can use weather as a weapon, you can also neutralize it.
[01:23:15.641 --> 01:23:26.343]  Patented, scientifically admitted, the newspaper even went and interviewed these major institutions, and, oh yes, we can totally control these hurricanes, we can shut them down, redirect them, but it's not going to happen.
[01:23:27.163 --> 01:23:31.384]  I guess then, because there wouldn't be $200 billion contracts for people's buddies.
[01:23:32.953 --> 01:23:37.115]  And if you admit that these things exist, then people will know it's being used as a weapon.
[01:23:38.015 --> 01:23:39.576]  But Mr. Livingston, please continue.
[01:23:39.616 --> 01:23:47.419]  Tell us about the government's culpability for Katrina and Rita, and then tell us about the Standard Research Institute and what they said about your findings.
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:53.502]  Well, in the 60s, there was a national priority.
[01:23:53.582 --> 01:23:59.044]  The government's national priority was to find a way to reduce the damage from hurricanes.
[01:23:59.895 --> 01:24:09.382]  So the Project Storm Fury was established, and Project Storm Fury involved a lot of military aircraft and planning and so forth.
[01:24:10.883 --> 01:24:17.687]  I was one of the five directors on the national board for Project Storm Fury.
[01:24:18.328 --> 01:24:29.055]  I wrote the operations plan, and I was in charge of most of the operations, a lot of the operations that were conducted in the mid-'60s on hurricanes in the Atlantic.
[01:24:29.878 --> 01:24:41.688]  And I had just come from a three-year tour of doing typhoon research in the Pacific, which is just a bigger storm than a hurricane, but nevertheless, they're pretty much the same.
[01:24:42.449 --> 01:24:56.721]  But after they shut Project Storm Fury down, they had made the logic for it that the data was not good enough, was not certified.
[01:24:58.667 --> 01:25:03.048]  And not of sufficient quality, if you will, to use in statistical studies.
[01:25:03.309 --> 01:25:04.069]  This sort of thing.
[01:25:05.789 --> 01:25:09.231]  Well, everyone knows in an airplane you don't necessarily get that kind of data.
[01:25:10.011 --> 01:25:22.595]  Although our airplanes today have instruments on board that we know as much about an individual storm or an energy cell in a hurricane as you could ever need to know.
[01:25:23.726 --> 01:25:40.719]  But just recently, I wrote to verify what the national policy is on hurricanes or any kind of research like this, and they said, and I'll read, the approach of NOAA with regard to minimizing the impact of hurricanes on U.S.
[01:25:40.739 --> 01:25:48.285]  citizens is to improve our forecast of the track and intensity of storms and to better warn those in harm's way.
[01:25:48.945 --> 01:25:53.449]  It is no longer the policy of NOAA to support or conduct weather modification research.
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:25:56.701]  So the government is completely out of business.
[01:25:56.782 --> 01:26:09.470]  Their budget for 2005 and the proposed budget for 2006 has not one penny of money in that budget for doing hurricane reconnaissance studies.
[01:26:09.510 --> 01:26:10.791]  Well, sir, let me ask you a question.
[01:26:10.831 --> 01:26:18.696]  If it's in international waters, what's to stop private insurance companies from sending in aircraft to block the storm?
[01:26:19.216 --> 01:26:23.219]  I mean, if they won't do it and we know that we can stop these storms and it's been proven...
[01:26:24.251 --> 01:26:32.533]  How dare them not allow... I mean, how much would it cost to deflect or to weaken one of these storms substantively?
[01:26:35.213 --> 01:26:41.554]  We have put forth a number which we may not be able to live with because we don't know exactly what the emissions would be.
[01:26:42.174 --> 01:26:50.776]  But we are of the mind that we could do the whole Atlantic coastline and the Gulf of Mexico for about $25 million for five months.
[01:26:51.987 --> 01:26:53.708]  So it's not a big bunch of money.
[01:26:54.329 --> 01:26:58.671]  It's actually a very, very small investment in what the returns ought to be.
[01:27:00.192 --> 01:27:04.835]  Yeah, $200 billion for Louisiana and the Gulf Coast, or $25 million.
[01:27:04.855 --> 01:27:05.796]  Those are billions, Alex.
[01:27:05.816 --> 01:27:06.096]  $200 billion.
[01:27:06.116 --> 01:27:07.557]  Exactly, $200 billion versus $25 million.
[01:27:07.577 --> 01:27:07.717]  Yeah.
[01:27:07.737 --> 01:27:10.259]  So the situation is, as I see it,
[01:27:21.401 --> 01:27:31.745]  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, they have a tremendous job to do, and they're doing a tremendous job.
[01:27:32.665 --> 01:27:41.228]  But their interest is in statistical data, which means you have to get a whole lot of the same kind of data to be sure it all verifies and works out.
[01:27:42.048 --> 01:27:46.890]  Whereas people who are concerned about hurricane damages
[01:27:47.643 --> 01:27:51.588]  Are interested more in results or empirical data.
[01:27:51.968 --> 01:28:02.280]  But we'll get into the Stanford Institute's research, but if you can admittedly, I mean, you've made giant storms, you've steered storms, and the data shows you can stop storms.
[01:28:03.227 --> 01:28:05.009]  Then there shouldn't be any debate about it.
[01:28:05.029 --> 01:28:09.252]  You know, the government says we're going to develop a plan to stop these.
[01:28:09.292 --> 01:28:13.435]  As soon as they learn how to stop them, that also means how to, I guess, increase their power.
[01:28:14.015 --> 01:28:19.119]  Suddenly they kill the program, and I'm told, sir, that it all went underground.
[01:28:21.201 --> 01:28:25.304]  I don't know that it went underground, but I haven't been able to get any information out of anyone.
[01:28:25.824 --> 01:28:32.209]  And I visited the number one or two man up in Boulder this spring.
[01:28:32.976 --> 01:28:34.097]  Stay there.
[01:28:34.137 --> 01:28:37.138]  I want to hear about it when we get back.
[01:28:37.158 --> 01:28:38.179]  We're very honored to have you.
[01:28:38.199 --> 01:28:39.019]  Please stay with us.
[01:28:43.361 --> 01:28:44.302]  We're on the march.
[01:28:44.742 --> 01:28:46.363]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.263 --> 01:28:49.965]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.155 --> 01:28:54.677]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:28:54.837 --> 01:28:55.958]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:28:56.159 --> 01:28:59.562]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:28:59.682 --> 01:29:00.083]  Phenol?
[01:29:00.423 --> 01:29:07.551]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:29:07.832 --> 01:29:11.956]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:29:12.056 --> 01:29:12.497]  Fragrance?
[01:29:12.857 --> 01:29:17.622]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:29:17.763 --> 01:29:22.448]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[01:29:22.668 --> 01:29:25.231]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[01:29:25.491 --> 01:29:28.895]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:29:29.055 --> 01:29:32.579]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:29:32.779 --> 01:29:35.160]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:36.180]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:46.043]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.
[01:29:46.243 --> 01:29:48.484]  Call Cal-Ben toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit CalBenPureSoap.com.
[01:29:53.419 --> 01:29:55.400]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:55.480 --> 01:30:06.186]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.566 --> 01:30:11.089]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.149 --> 01:30:22.495]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.075 --> 01:30:29.921]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.322 --> 01:30:32.463]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:32.944 --> 01:30:37.928]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 hose filter elements.
[01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:44.374]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-9000.
[01:30:46.516 --> 01:30:55.643]  Hey, Jack Blood here from Deadline Live.
[01:30:55.683 --> 01:30:58.585]  You know, it seems people will steal anything and everything you have.
[01:30:58.765 --> 01:31:04.109]  If you have a house with some equity, a car, a truck, RV, there was someone looking for a way to rip it off.
[01:31:04.369 --> 01:31:05.890]  And what about those government agencies?
[01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:08.192]  You know, the ones, those alphabet agencies?
[01:31:08.372 --> 01:31:12.015]  Did you know that they get raises, promotions, and bonuses based on what they see?
[01:31:12.275 --> 01:31:14.277]  And they can do it without due process.
[01:31:14.337 --> 01:31:17.799]  This is how the establishment has been attaining real wealth for centuries.
[01:31:17.939 --> 01:31:21.242]  And now you can learn the secrets that the elite have used for generations.
[01:31:21.442 --> 01:31:22.243]  We're good to go.
[01:31:22.283 --> 01:31:22.944]  We're good to go.
[01:31:36.579 --> 01:31:40.061]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:31:40.081 --> 01:31:42.121]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:03.536 --> 01:32:15.739]  There is a war on for your mind, defending liberty, resisting tyranny, whether it's the Republicans or the Democrats doing it, exposing the operations that have been secret for so long, or the public's just ignorant of.
[01:32:16.239 --> 01:32:17.259]  I'm honored to be your host.
[01:32:17.340 --> 01:32:24.641]  Talking to Ben Livingston, physicist, I guess, Dr. Livingston, during the breaks, it's just amazing.
[01:32:25.161 --> 01:32:30.943]  He was the commanding officer for, I guess, a decade at the Naval Weapons Research Laboratory.
[01:32:31.784 --> 01:32:36.266]  And with Hurricane Debbie, they successfully shut it down.
[01:32:36.286 --> 01:32:41.889]  I mean, this guy headed up major commissions, folks.
[01:32:42.309 --> 01:32:43.630]  But then the program got killed.
[01:32:43.730 --> 01:32:44.910]  Oh, you can shut down hurricanes?
[01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:45.530]  Well, that's it.
[01:32:46.771 --> 01:32:49.532]  Sir, please repeat what you just told me during the break.
[01:32:52.093 --> 01:32:59.977]  Well, what I was alluding to or reminding you of is that we had so many scientists...
[01:33:01.224 --> 01:33:02.344]  On each side of the fence.
[01:33:02.964 --> 01:33:17.308]  So on the side of the scientists who didn't want any more weather modification flights to take place, said they needed a third party to evaluate the program, the Storm Fury project, including Hurricane Debbie.
[01:33:17.928 --> 01:33:30.351]  So they employed the Stanford Research Institute to study the entire Storm Fury experiments, all three of them, and they wrote that
[01:33:32.216 --> 01:33:44.289]  Stanford Research wrote that they may have to accept responsibility for not seating and thereby exposing the public to higher probabilities of severe storm damage and possible higher death tolls.
[01:33:44.490 --> 01:33:50.176]  We claim they should consider now if a big hurricane comes straight for Miami.
[01:33:50.953 --> 01:33:53.474]  Now, that's the Stanford Research Institute.
[01:33:53.554 --> 01:33:57.316]  Now, yeah, so they're saying we've got a liability now if we don't do something about this.
[01:33:57.376 --> 01:34:00.678]  Describe what happened with Debbie in 1969.
[01:34:00.738 --> 01:34:01.158]  What happened?
[01:34:01.198 --> 01:34:02.079]  What were you able to do?
[01:34:02.419 --> 01:34:15.045]  Well, Hurricane Debbie was a storm of, I think, about 600 miles off of the...
[01:34:18.466 --> 01:34:23.509]  Off the Atlantic coast, out in the mid-Atlantic, if you will, away from everything.
[01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:44.259]  And what happened on Debbie was on the 18th of August in 1969, the records show that after five seedings at two-hour intervals on the 18th, the researchers determined that the micro wind speed had decreased from 115 miles an hour to 80 miles per hour, a remarkable reduction of 30% or about 45% in damage reduction.
[01:34:47.654 --> 01:34:51.617]  It said for the next 24 hours, the hurricane was left to its own devices.
[01:34:52.158 --> 01:35:02.826]  And when the aircraft returned for the second round of seeding on August the 20th, the second seeding decreased the wind speeds again to just under 100 miles an hour, a reduction of about 15%.
[01:35:04.748 --> 01:35:16.097]  So some of the scientists didn't think we had enough data to go operational with this, and that's when they asked for this third-party
[01:35:16.621 --> 01:35:19.642]  To evaluate the program, and that's what Stanford Research did.
[01:35:20.263 --> 01:35:32.048]  And they did, as we read there a while ago, determine that we ought to keep on doing some cloud seeding on these hurricanes for damage reduction.
[01:35:33.649 --> 01:35:34.169]  Amazing.
[01:35:34.209 --> 01:35:42.252]  Now, you created storms or intensified storms in Vietnam and, of course, flew missions as well in Korea doing that?
[01:35:42.733 --> 01:35:43.253]  We didn't do it.
[01:35:43.273 --> 01:35:44.573]  It wasn't done in Korea.
[01:35:46.511 --> 01:35:50.074]  I believe I'm the first person to ever do it in the military, in the field.
[01:35:50.254 --> 01:35:51.355]  But you were in Korea, though.
[01:35:52.215 --> 01:35:54.978]  I was, but not in its capacity.
[01:35:55.478 --> 01:35:56.479]  Okay.
[01:35:56.499 --> 01:35:57.960]  The newspaper wasn't clear on that.
[01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.761]  I mean, let's digress for a second.
[01:36:00.082 --> 01:36:01.322]  What did you do in Vietnam?
[01:36:01.342 --> 01:36:05.526]  You know, the opposite of stopping storms or weakening them, you were intensifying them.
[01:36:06.406 --> 01:36:15.854]  The object in Vietnam, of course, was to make as much rain as you possibly could and do as much water or flooding damage as you could to the...
[01:36:17.389 --> 01:36:18.989]  To the infrastructure, road structure.
[01:36:20.510 --> 01:36:43.914]  There were no paved roads over there, and the Ho Chi Minh Trail had a constant string of trucks on it, and during the dry part of the year, of course, they were able to resupply their troops or whatever down in South Vietnam, so that my job was to make the monsoon season last longer.
[01:36:45.217 --> 01:36:46.038]  How did you do that?
[01:36:46.078 --> 01:36:48.899]  Take minimum clouds and make monster clouds out of them.
[01:36:48.939 --> 01:36:50.240]  Make storms out of them.
[01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:56.143]  Well, tell us your position at that time, and yes, you are the first to develop this.
[01:36:57.244 --> 01:37:02.907]  Please describe operationally what you can of what happened.
[01:37:04.928 --> 01:37:11.552]  Well, I was assigned from the Naval Weapons Research Laboratories in California, in China Lake, California.
[01:37:12.205 --> 01:37:14.487]  To a Marine Fighter Squadron out in Vietnam.
[01:37:15.688 --> 01:37:22.572]  And I had special airplanes assigned to me, if you will, that carried cloud seeding flares instead of guns.
[01:37:24.334 --> 01:37:37.283]  But my position there was to get in the airplane, go find clouds that I thought could make rain, or get more rain out of, and seed those clouds for maximum precipitation values.
[01:37:38.872 --> 01:37:55.943]  And I was on every flight that was made in 1966, and you'll see those in some of the literature, the literature before the Congress, if you will, that was revealed only in 1972, where they acknowledged that I had done all the flying in 1966.
[01:37:56.063 --> 01:38:03.228]  And in 1967, I went to Guam and trained about 16 or 18 Air Force pilots and meteorologists
[01:38:07.617 --> 01:38:09.478]  How to seed clouds in Vietnam.
[01:38:09.498 --> 01:38:16.400]  So you were literally a one-man army for a whole year attacking them up there in your little fighter bomber spraying the clouds.
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:16.920]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:17.021 --> 01:38:18.821]  I had a civilian with me.
[01:38:19.541 --> 01:38:24.303]  And what made our product work, we were so flexible, we could do whatever we wanted to do.
[01:38:24.943 --> 01:38:36.888]  And as alluded to in the Secretary of Navy's citation, we actually changed our power techniques to suit the clouds we had to work with.
[01:38:37.992 --> 01:38:39.954]  And we could do the same thing in hurricanes.
[01:38:40.494 --> 01:38:46.058]  We would have that same kind of flexibility if we needed to exercise it in the Atlantic.
[01:38:46.599 --> 01:38:50.382]  And that's something the government will never have in an operation that the government runs.
[01:38:52.443 --> 01:39:00.870]  How dangerous is it when you've... I mean, you have logged more missions, the paper reports, than pretty much anybody out there into hurricanes.
[01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:03.011]  What is it like when you go up into a hurricane?
[01:39:04.713 --> 01:39:05.754]  Well, surprisingly...
[01:39:06.869 --> 01:39:15.072]  At altitude, that is at 20,000 feet or above, a good part of the time you're out in the most beautiful VFR weather you've ever seen.
[01:39:15.092 --> 01:39:21.294]  If it's at night, you can see the stars, the moon, or daytime, the sun, or whatever.
[01:39:21.894 --> 01:39:29.937]  So you can not only see what you're going to see, but you can also analyze it on your radar before you go there.
[01:39:30.097 --> 01:39:33.398]  But generally speaking, it's not real hazardous flying.
[01:39:36.252 --> 01:39:40.554]  So, what about when we watch the news and they show one of those airplanes flying into the storm?
[01:39:41.394 --> 01:39:44.835]  Well, that's wonderful.
[01:39:46.996 --> 01:39:51.958]  The only problem that you can have flying into those storms is icing conditions.
[01:39:52.758 --> 01:39:58.000]  And I'm sure the planes we see flying are not taking on a lot of ice, so they wouldn't be airborne.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.721]  You know what I mean?
[01:40:02.922 --> 01:40:04.763]  But I'm afraid what we see on TV...
[01:40:06.149 --> 01:40:07.891]  It's a few minutes of a hard flight.
[01:40:09.092 --> 01:40:09.733]  So it's hype.
[01:40:10.454 --> 01:40:10.674]  Yeah.
[01:40:10.734 --> 01:40:22.968]  You know, you go do your job in a particular cell or energy cell and get out in the clear blue skies and go to the next one if that's what you're doing.
[01:40:25.006 --> 01:40:28.309]  Now, let's go back because this is amazing.
[01:40:28.649 --> 01:40:29.970]  Specifically, what would you do?
[01:40:30.010 --> 01:40:36.555]  What kind of cloud formation would you know that was over the Ho Chi Minh Trail that was ideal?
[01:40:36.655 --> 01:40:37.275]  What would you do?
[01:40:38.836 --> 01:40:44.401]  What did you train these Marine Corps pilots and meteorologists to do?
[01:40:46.302 --> 01:40:48.404]  I trained Air Force pilots and meteorologists.
[01:40:48.644 --> 01:40:50.405]  But I was flying with the Marine Corps.
[01:40:53.391 --> 01:40:57.934]  I understand in the first year in 66, and then I was mentioning 67, yeah.
[01:40:58.034 --> 01:40:58.334]  Uh-huh.
[01:40:58.414 --> 01:41:05.077]  In 1967, of course, the Air Force, and I flew with them on almost all their missions in 1967, if you will.
[01:41:05.117 --> 01:41:07.679]  I was in the cockpit pointing to clouds and so forth.
[01:41:08.179 --> 01:41:13.622]  Because that was almost exclusively a VFR or visual operation there in Vietnam.
[01:41:14.383 --> 01:41:18.625]  Because you'd pick out a cloud that had a little growth in it, and you'd very delicately...
[01:41:19.832 --> 01:41:21.633]  Build it up until it got a little bigger.
[01:41:21.673 --> 01:41:28.635]  Then you might seed it with a large number of nuclei, if you will, and make that cloud just grow, grow, grow.
[01:41:29.415 --> 01:41:29.795]  You see?
[01:41:32.876 --> 01:41:33.737]  That was the whole object.
[01:41:33.777 --> 01:41:41.979]  We didn't have big clouds to work with over there because we were in the monsoon season and the big clouds had gone away days before.
[01:41:42.199 --> 01:41:43.440]  Explain how that works.
[01:41:44.969 --> 01:41:45.349]  Pardon me?
[01:41:45.650 --> 01:41:50.193]  Can you give us the specifics of, you know, when you say build it up and then seed it with new clouds?
[01:41:50.213 --> 01:41:54.756]  Yeah, well, in any cloud, you have active sails.
[01:41:54.796 --> 01:42:01.882]  That is, that cloud that have vertical velocities that are ascending, if you will, going up.
[01:42:02.642 --> 01:42:04.103]  Well, those are active clouds.
[01:42:05.284 --> 01:42:12.630]  Well, in a marginal condition, the top of that active sail will only go to maybe the freezing level,
[01:42:13.194 --> 01:42:13.814]  Are there about?
[01:42:13.894 --> 01:42:16.895]  Then it'll just die out or dissipate.
[01:42:17.915 --> 01:42:31.539]  So the idea is to have a pyrotechnic that you can take those little clouds in just about the time you think they're at their maximum natural vertical height.
[01:42:32.339 --> 01:42:37.781]  You very delicately seed that by putting more nuclei in it so that there's small drops in that cloud.
[01:42:38.542 --> 01:42:40.903]  And now I have some place to collect or coalesce.
[01:42:41.043 --> 01:42:42.343]  And then now it starts building?
[01:42:42.583 --> 01:42:49.304]  Now it starts building because it releases the heat of condensation from each one of these little drops, and it goes up.
[01:42:50.064 --> 01:42:56.246]  What did Charlie think you were doing, watching planes flying around, shooting pyrotechnics into them?
[01:42:56.866 --> 01:42:57.606]  What did who think?
[01:42:58.126 --> 01:43:00.847]  What did the Vietnamese think you were doing?
[01:43:00.887 --> 01:43:02.567]  Oh, they never knew we were there.
[01:43:04.611 --> 01:43:06.312]  Oh, so the communists didn't even know what you were doing?
[01:43:06.872 --> 01:43:09.593]  They never knew what we were up there for or whatever.
[01:43:10.153 --> 01:43:11.714]  Did they ever shoot SAMs at you?
[01:43:11.874 --> 01:43:12.274]  Yes, sir.
[01:43:13.455 --> 01:43:17.077]  But we had a fighter cover to take care of that.
[01:43:17.897 --> 01:43:19.658]  Oh, the fighters would draw the missiles?
[01:43:19.998 --> 01:43:20.258]  Yeah.
[01:43:22.379 --> 01:43:23.259]  We were there to make it rain.
[01:43:25.595 --> 01:43:28.877]  And we weren't there to protect ourselves from ground fire or whatever.
[01:43:28.897 --> 01:43:31.339]  Well, I tell you, that certainly is brave.
[01:43:32.060 --> 01:43:34.662]  But, I mean, can you describe what would the fighters do?
[01:43:34.722 --> 01:43:36.383]  Stay lower and try to get the missiles?
[01:43:36.403 --> 01:43:37.524]  No, no, they'd stay up higher.
[01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:41.286]  Well, how would they get the missile to track them then?
[01:43:42.427 --> 01:43:53.695]  Well, in every Phantom jet, there's a piece of military equipment in there that was there for the sole purpose of detecting when a SAM missile hit.
[01:43:54.119 --> 01:43:55.580]  Were there ever close calls?
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:55.840]  Well, yeah.
[01:44:26.935 --> 01:44:27.356]  There were.
[01:44:27.376 --> 01:44:33.218]  Did you ever lose any of the planes that were up in the air with you seating?
[01:44:35.379 --> 01:44:35.879]  Nobody.
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:43.523]  That's the whole purpose of having these detecting equipment on board is to know if somebody's shooting at you or not.
[01:44:44.243 --> 01:44:48.365]  Now, the problem happens when two or three missiles come at you at one time from different directions.
[01:44:48.985 --> 01:44:50.986]  You may not be able to duck them all.
[01:44:52.150 --> 01:44:54.231]  But that wasn't the situation where we were.
[01:44:54.251 --> 01:44:59.653]  That's got to be amazing to be flying around at 20,000-30,000 feet and have missiles shooting past you.
[01:45:00.753 --> 01:45:02.994]  Well, you know, that's what war is about.
[01:45:04.534 --> 01:45:05.575]  Just amazing, sir.
[01:45:05.655 --> 01:45:07.115]  Just an unbelievable interview.
[01:45:07.795 --> 01:45:17.358]  So if you can neutralize or weaken hurricanes, I would guess hurricanes could be strengthened then, Doctor?
[01:45:18.139 --> 01:45:18.639]  I think so.
[01:45:20.254 --> 01:45:21.995]  How would you strengthen a hurricane?
[01:45:22.015 --> 01:45:23.135]  Can you tell us about that?
[01:45:24.655 --> 01:45:34.358]  Well, instead of trying to take the tops out of them, you would merely see them at a lower altitude to make them grow.
[01:45:34.639 --> 01:45:40.000]  Take advantage of the latent heat of condensation to make each cell grow instead of tearing it apart.
[01:45:42.221 --> 01:45:44.462]  And what chemical would you add to strengthen?
[01:45:44.502 --> 01:45:45.442]  You'd use the same one.
[01:45:47.343 --> 01:45:48.483]  Just a different technique.
[01:45:49.116 --> 01:45:51.298]  Would it be the reverse of the process, or how would this work?
[01:45:52.719 --> 01:45:56.623]  Generally speaking, you would do your seeding from a little bit lower altitude.
[01:45:57.704 --> 01:46:09.995]  In trying to break the top off, you would seed so that your nucleating material was exhausted when it got to the top of where natural condensation was taking place.
[01:46:10.275 --> 01:46:15.400]  So basically, you do the same thing you were doing in Vietnam, and then to neutralize a hurricane, you would do what?
[01:46:16.986 --> 01:46:28.831]  Well, when you neutralize a hurricane, it's no different than when you neutralize a thunderstorm to keep it from hailing on somebody.
[01:46:30.732 --> 01:46:43.657]  You merely stop the vertical currents in the cloud from being able to take moisture high enough for them to freeze and then collect more moisture
[01:46:44.278 --> 01:46:56.085]  Now, are you aware of Secretary of Defense Cohen's comment in 97 about weather weapons being the wave of the future?
[01:46:56.906 --> 01:46:58.106]  I'm aware of that, yes sir.
[01:46:59.567 --> 01:47:00.808]  What is your take on that?
[01:47:02.569 --> 01:47:05.131]  Well, hindsight's really great.
[01:47:06.231 --> 01:47:12.175]  But my take on that is that paying lip service to somebody and nothing else.
[01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:23.694]  Because they certainly never try to engage any of the corporate people that do this for a living to join NOAA some way.
[01:47:24.694 --> 01:47:25.875]  We ought to be complimentary.
[01:47:28.816 --> 01:47:32.958]  We ought to have a synergistic relationship with NOAA.
[01:47:33.398 --> 01:47:37.379]  As I see it, they ought to do what they do best and want to have the patience.
[01:47:37.519 --> 01:47:43.902]  But Dr. Livingston, you're a good person, so you wouldn't do bad things with this, though you have used it as a weapon against an enemy that was
[01:47:44.659 --> 01:47:44.799]  Okay.
[01:47:44.839 --> 01:47:47.261]  I really don't think that's happening at all because...
[01:48:15.084 --> 01:48:19.086]  One of our team members is the world's largest manufacturer of cloud seeding material.
[01:48:20.346 --> 01:48:22.707]  And he has never sold the government an ounce of this stuff.
[01:48:24.767 --> 01:48:26.688]  You don't think they could be secretly producing it?
[01:48:28.789 --> 01:48:33.210]  They didn't secretly produce it when I was in the military working on top secret projects.
[01:48:33.230 --> 01:48:34.911]  You know what I mean?
[01:48:36.791 --> 01:48:41.833]  We had a contractor that did it, but the scientific community
[01:48:42.543 --> 01:48:49.266]  I had some idea of what was going on, but they could never put their finger on it because of the classification.
[01:48:49.726 --> 01:48:56.009]  So why then, if the government could have minimized or stopped Katrina and Rita, why didn't they do it?
[01:48:56.049 --> 01:48:58.810]  I mean, some people need to get in trouble for this.
[01:48:59.530 --> 01:49:10.055]  Well, this is a sad thing to say, but if you look at this far enough, you're liable to get a bad opinion about all this in that politically...
[01:49:11.161 --> 01:49:14.645]  There's no way to get a vote cheaper than to go pass out $10 bills.
[01:49:15.847 --> 01:49:24.457]  And as far as the building industry, there's no quicker way to sell more material and raise the prices on them than to be in construction energy.
[01:49:24.897 --> 01:49:27.921]  Well, you just said it amazing, Dr. Livingston.
[01:49:28.261 --> 01:49:30.204]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[01:49:31.862 --> 01:49:32.903]  They could stop this.
[01:49:32.963 --> 01:49:40.429]  I mean, $25 million, you could knock it out the whole season there in the Caribbean and in the Atlantic.
[01:49:40.789 --> 01:49:42.150]  But no, we just can't have that.
[01:49:42.170 --> 01:49:47.895]  We've got to pay $200 billion out for a bunch of big rigging scams down in the Gulf.
[01:49:47.975 --> 01:49:50.257]  We'll be right back with Dr. Livingston.
[01:49:50.957 --> 01:49:51.398]  Amazing.
[01:49:54.326 --> 01:49:57.188]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[01:49:57.428 --> 01:49:58.129]  Hello, my friends.
[01:49:58.229 --> 01:49:59.029]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:59.349 --> 01:50:04.032]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11 Rise of the Police State.
[01:50:04.373 --> 01:50:11.117]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy, out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy.
[01:50:11.437 --> 01:50:13.419]  A dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[01:50:13.619 --> 01:50:16.462]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[01:50:16.562 --> 01:50:21.226]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[01:50:21.426 --> 01:50:25.830]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[01:50:26.070 --> 01:50:33.277]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[01:50:33.537 --> 01:50:35.959]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[01:50:36.119 --> 01:50:37.861]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[01:50:53.607 --> 01:50:57.509]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.729 --> 01:51:03.172]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.452 --> 01:51:13.817]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:13.977 --> 01:51:18.319]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.499 --> 01:51:26.866]  Trihalomethane and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:27.126 --> 01:51:33.511]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.611 --> 01:51:38.095]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.
[01:51:38.315 --> 01:51:42.518]  Normally $48 each, get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:51:42.899 --> 01:51:46.922]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium
[01:51:47.082 --> 01:51:48.103]  We're good to go.
[01:52:10.237 --> 01:52:10.898]  We're good to go.
[01:52:30.458 --> 01:52:30.658]  I think.
[01:52:30.698 --> 01:52:30.918]  I think.
[01:52:30.938 --> 01:52:31.178]  I think.
[01:53:03.007 --> 01:53:03.408]  All right.
[01:53:03.428 --> 01:53:15.794]  Dr. Livingston, I mean, the pioneer of weather weapons in Vietnam, will stay with us until about 16, 17 after, into the next hour.
[01:53:17.015 --> 01:53:23.218]  And, you know, I might have time to take a few calls if it's specifically for Dr. Livingston on weather control.
[01:53:23.238 --> 01:53:25.259]  I know he had callers holding since before he got on.
[01:53:25.299 --> 01:53:26.440]  We'll get to you after he's gone.
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:29.582]  But, I mean, it's just what a wealth of knowledge.
[01:53:29.642 --> 01:53:29.982]  I want to
[01:53:31.044 --> 01:53:33.926]  Getting back on in the near future.
[01:53:34.026 --> 01:53:36.928]  But you're talking about somebody who headed up these weapons laboratories.
[01:53:37.369 --> 01:53:42.853]  They successfully defeated major hurricanes and had outside firms confirm that.
[01:53:43.914 --> 01:53:46.415]  But now nothing's being done.
[01:53:46.456 --> 01:53:52.120]  Before we hit the break, sir, you talked about how the politicians love an excuse to hand out pork barrel.
[01:53:53.175 --> 01:53:55.996]  Well, I contacted our two state senators early last spring, as well as the
[01:54:16.464 --> 01:54:20.185]  Assistant Director of NOAA and some other people in high places, if you will.
[01:54:20.305 --> 01:54:22.145]  You're talking about Cornyn and Hutchinson.
[01:54:22.225 --> 01:54:23.665]  I'm talking about Cornyn and Hutchinson.
[01:54:23.685 --> 01:54:27.226]  And now she's passed the new Weather Control Bureau.
[01:54:27.626 --> 01:54:29.086]  Well, see, I've never heard of that.
[01:54:29.927 --> 01:54:31.527]  That bill just passed a month ago, yeah.
[01:54:31.847 --> 01:54:32.307]  Oh, really?
[01:54:33.207 --> 01:54:35.067]  Well, okay, that might be good news.
[01:54:37.628 --> 01:54:43.549]  But it's not unusual for... Well, it's back up to the insurance and energy people.
[01:54:46.013 --> 01:54:58.598]  I've had explained to me by both the energy and the insurance industry people that they don't lose anything, not really, for very long in these storms.
[01:54:59.679 --> 01:55:04.100]  Because the way the insurance industry works... They just jack up prices.
[01:55:04.401 --> 01:55:06.001]  Yeah, they just jack up the prices.
[01:55:06.061 --> 01:55:07.602]  In 90 days they've got their money back.
[01:55:08.662 --> 01:55:10.223]  So it doesn't really make that much difference.
[01:55:10.983 --> 01:55:12.384]  And the same with the energy industry.
[01:55:13.344 --> 01:55:15.105]  It doesn't make that much difference to them either.
[01:55:16.081 --> 01:55:22.463]  In the long run, in both cases, the prices are raised up, but they're never lowered.
[01:55:22.483 --> 01:55:30.046]  Well, we just got oil company memos where Mobil, Exxon, and Chevron all got together and said, let's shut down refineries.
[01:55:30.566 --> 01:55:30.826]  Yeah.
[01:55:31.866 --> 01:55:32.206]  Okay.
[01:55:32.706 --> 01:55:33.387]  To make more money.
[01:55:33.867 --> 01:55:34.107]  Yeah.
[01:55:35.327 --> 01:55:35.788]  Sure enough.
[01:55:37.348 --> 01:55:40.009]  So you've actually talked to these bastards, and they've told you this.
[01:55:40.089 --> 01:55:40.469]  I have.
[01:55:40.549 --> 01:55:43.250]  I've got several pieces of correspondence here from them.
[01:55:45.470 --> 01:55:46.351]  Unbelievable, sir.
[01:55:46.771 --> 01:55:52.675]  I worked the Chevron for, I'd say, four or five months, and never did get to talk to risk management people.
[01:55:54.396 --> 01:55:57.899]  I kept getting put off, you know, sidetracked.
[01:55:59.920 --> 01:56:03.783]  And you've run entire federal programs dealing with weather modification.
[01:56:04.724 --> 01:56:05.124]  Yes, sir.
[01:56:08.030 --> 01:56:08.911]  Well, there you have it.
[01:56:08.971 --> 01:56:16.417]  Next time a hurricane is barreling towards us and hundreds of people are going to die and billions of dollars of damage, just know they're letting it happen.
[01:56:16.938 --> 01:56:24.504]  Well, believe it or not, we tried to do the month of September for less than a million dollars and couldn't get a taker.
[01:56:26.105 --> 01:56:29.268]  And that would have been Katrina.
[01:56:32.404 --> 01:56:32.784]  And Rita.
[01:56:33.085 --> 01:56:44.693]  You know, Doctor, instead of focusing on Cloud City, which we know works, everybody likes to focus on the fancy ionizing with antennas and Russian systems and PARP systems.
[01:56:44.893 --> 01:56:45.814]  What's your take on that?
[01:56:48.556 --> 01:56:52.019]  I just don't... I've read some of the literature.
[01:56:52.039 --> 01:57:01.666]  It just looks to me like if you're a very smart, astute salesman, you might get a sponsor for a year or two.
[01:57:02.697 --> 01:57:16.108]  But I don't understand, from a purely physical look at it, how ionizing a cloud is going to change the weather a whole lot.
[01:57:17.129 --> 01:57:28.137]  Because, number one, you cannot, I just believe you cannot, generate enough ions, either positive or negative, to influence a cloud.
[01:57:28.398 --> 01:57:29.599]  We'll come right back.
[01:57:29.619 --> 01:57:31.060]  Stay with us, Doctor.
[01:57:32.890 --> 01:57:33.050]  Hello!
[01:57:33.090 --> 01:57:33.191]  Hello!
[01:57:49.432 --> 01:57:50.092]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.753 --> 01:57:51.793]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:52.513 --> 01:57:53.634]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.294 --> 01:57:55.094]  You want answers?
[01:57:55.855 --> 01:57:56.795]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.415 --> 01:58:01.177]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.597 --> 01:58:05.719]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.581 --> 01:58:10.861]  I'm sick and tired of it.
[01:58:10.881 --> 01:58:14.523]  We're going to have to shell out $200 million.
[01:58:14.543 --> 01:58:16.284]  Now it's way overinflated.
[01:58:16.364 --> 01:58:17.024]  Pork barrel.
[01:58:18.624 --> 01:58:32.956]  And the evidence is, and I know people that work for cloud seeding companies, and we're talking a big granddaddy of it all right now, Dr. Ben Livingston, they could neutralize, deflect, weaken these hurricanes.
[01:58:33.417 --> 01:58:34.578]  It's been demonstrated.
[01:58:34.618 --> 01:58:36.299]  They've done it back in the late 60s.
[01:58:36.759 --> 01:58:45.767]  And they're not allowed to, and for chicken feed, for a couple planes loaded up with chemicals, they can go knock out these hurricanes, and they don't let it happen.
[01:58:46.624 --> 01:58:50.951]  Because a bunch of greedy fat bastards, and I hate to talk like that, but it really makes me mad.
[01:58:50.971 --> 01:58:52.733]  I don't normally talk like that.
[01:58:53.274 --> 01:58:57.441]  Because a bunch of sickos want a bunch of control and a bunch of money.
[01:58:57.461 --> 01:58:58.122]  This doesn't happen.
[01:58:59.096 --> 01:59:03.598]  And this is not the way this country should operate, and we're really pleased to be joined by Dr. Livingston.
[01:59:04.499 --> 01:59:06.960]  Doctor, we're going to keep it to this segment and one other segment.
[01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:11.342]  I want to take a few calls coming up, but there's so many other facets to this story.
[01:59:11.722 --> 01:59:23.248]  How do we force the government to allow companies like yours and others that have proven this, even when you were heading up government programs, to start protecting the American people?
[01:59:23.468 --> 01:59:24.368]  Forget the money.
[01:59:24.608 --> 01:59:25.889]  What about the loss of life?
[01:59:27.648 --> 01:59:33.309]  Well, recently I sent a letter, a proposal, if you will, to all 100 senators.
[01:59:34.810 --> 01:59:39.291]  I have not heard back from but one of those, and that's Senator Cornyn.
[01:59:40.931 --> 01:59:43.392]  He is trying to do for me anything I think he can.
[01:59:47.593 --> 01:59:49.333]  But I just don't see it.
[01:59:49.593 --> 01:59:56.455]  It's not going to happen to the government unless they're exposed some way, and that's my only reason for, if you will, doing this interview.
[01:59:57.404 --> 02:00:00.666]  Someone needs to know the truth of this matter.
[02:00:02.487 --> 02:00:08.991]  Because it's not right that we have hurricanes coming ashore and we cannot stop or kill hurricanes.
[02:00:09.532 --> 02:00:12.974]  But we can weaken them and pulse them, if you will.
[02:00:13.394 --> 02:00:15.896]  They may grow back, but we'll knock them back down again.
[02:00:16.496 --> 02:00:20.639]  So that we would do all of our work within 200 or 300 miles of the shoreline.
[02:00:21.679 --> 02:00:25.542]  So we don't really care what the strengths of these are.
[02:00:26.934 --> 02:00:33.056]  Hurricanes are, when they're offshore, we only care what happens when they hit land, make landfall.
[02:00:34.076 --> 02:00:46.560]  And we would, in our proposal to them, we have stated that we would reduce the winds and the rainfall by 25% in a hurricane.
[02:00:46.580 --> 02:00:52.862]  Well, if you can get down to 100 mile an hour range, most buildings will stand that.
[02:00:53.862 --> 02:00:54.222]  You see?
[02:00:55.725 --> 02:00:58.227]  And get below that, of course, you'll have very little damage.
[02:00:59.187 --> 02:01:01.348]  Now that's with your modest approach.
[02:01:01.508 --> 02:01:05.610]  I mean, with even more, couldn't you do even more to the hurricane?
[02:01:07.731 --> 02:01:12.994]  I think that's a safe thing to, if you will, place a bet on.
[02:01:14.415 --> 02:01:23.619]  I think if we can, without any trouble, because we did it in the 60s, we had those kind of numbers in the 60s on more than one storm.
[02:01:23.639 --> 02:01:24.720]  Do you see?
[02:01:25.720 --> 02:01:27.121]  So I don't have any question.
[02:01:27.141 --> 02:01:29.462]  We've got better everything now than we had then.
[02:01:29.482 --> 02:01:37.747]  Faster airplanes and better pyrotechnics, a bigger payload, outstanding positioning equipment.
[02:01:37.947 --> 02:01:42.830]  How much chemical would it take to shut the hurricane down and have it dump its water into the Gulf of Mexico?
[02:01:42.890 --> 02:01:45.612]  You see, I don't know if you can do that or not.
[02:01:46.472 --> 02:01:52.095]  But I think that we ought to be trying to demonstrate that we can do the first 25% first and then expand our...
[02:01:55.600 --> 02:01:58.222]  But this was demonstrated with debris in 69.
[02:01:58.542 --> 02:01:58.923]  Yes.
[02:01:59.503 --> 02:02:01.745]  It was demonstrated to 25-30%.
[02:02:02.946 --> 02:02:05.127]  And I've seen the Weather Channel special.
[02:02:05.147 --> 02:02:08.090]  Did they consult you on that, Doctor, because you were the one doing it?
[02:02:08.130 --> 02:02:12.173]  I mean, they admitted like, you know, five, six feet of water, torrential rains.
[02:02:12.233 --> 02:02:15.515]  I mean, you guys were just flooding the northern Vietnamese.
[02:02:15.695 --> 02:02:16.056]  Yeah.
[02:02:17.377 --> 02:02:20.979]  Well, this thing is longer than it is wide.
[02:02:22.080 --> 02:02:24.182]  But if you look at the Gulf of Mexico...
[02:02:25.095 --> 02:02:35.144]  And the winds that generate these waves that they call the surge, that's only good across about 45 degrees, and when the wind changes more than 45 degrees, it knocks the top off.
[02:02:36.085 --> 02:02:37.687]  It knocks the top off of these big waves.
[02:02:38.707 --> 02:02:39.848]  Stay there, sir.
[02:02:40.189 --> 02:02:40.869]  We've got a break.
[02:02:40.909 --> 02:02:42.030]  Tell us about that when we get back.
[02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.491]  Stay with us.
[02:02:45.959 --> 02:02:53.344]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:02:53.604 --> 02:02:58.347]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:02:58.567 --> 02:03:04.211]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:03:04.451 --> 02:03:08.993]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:03:09.214 --> 02:03:16.357]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:03:16.377 --> 02:03:20.920]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:03:21.080 --> 02:03:23.581]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:03:23.821 --> 02:03:30.525]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.
[02:03:30.825 --> 02:03:31.085]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:03:45.327 --> 02:03:46.968]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:03:47.088 --> 02:03:51.192]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:03:51.332 --> 02:03:54.214]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:03:54.294 --> 02:04:01.019]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:04:01.199 --> 02:04:04.201]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:04:04.402 --> 02:04:06.803]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:04:06.923 --> 02:04:11.527]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[02:04:11.567 --> 02:04:12.528]  We're good to go.
[02:04:36.246 --> 02:04:36.286]  803-4438.
[02:04:36.306 --> 02:04:36.627]  That's 888-803-4438.
[02:04:44.921 --> 02:04:46.543]  Been a while since you've seen the dentist?
[02:04:46.783 --> 02:04:47.644]  Kids need braces?

[02:05:46.096 --> 02:05:48.278]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:48.878 --> 02:05:51.721]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:51.901 --> 02:05:59.286]  Alright, we're going to take a few calls for our guest.
[02:06:00.387 --> 02:06:02.129]  And he is a cloud physicist.
[02:06:02.209 --> 02:06:07.333]  And to be specific, that is not exactly a doctorate.
[02:06:07.373 --> 02:06:09.194]  I'm going to be precise about that.
[02:06:09.514 --> 02:06:09.895]  A meteorologist.
[02:06:09.915 --> 02:06:10.295]  A meteorologist.
[02:06:11.187 --> 02:06:12.448]  He's a meteorologist, not a doctor.
[02:06:12.628 --> 02:06:22.973]  I just seem to think of the head of the weapons program for a decade with weather modification warfare tools as a doctor, but he's a physicist and a meteorologist.
[02:06:23.373 --> 02:06:27.875]  So it's his own scientific discipline, showing my ignorance here.
[02:06:28.995 --> 02:06:36.819]  But just amazing to be able to be talking to Ben Livingston, who also is incredibly brave up there on all those missions, having a...
[02:06:37.469 --> 02:06:38.050]  We're good to go.
[02:06:58.024 --> 02:07:07.972]  Ben, continuing, though, before we take these calls, any other areas or facets you want to talk about that you weren't aware, because it hasn't gotten any attention, of Kay Bailey Hutchinson's bill?
[02:07:07.992 --> 02:07:10.274]  I believe it's 517, going from memory.
[02:07:10.434 --> 02:07:20.262]  We've read the bill here on air, and it'll create this 10-member board and federal funding to, quote, deal with hurricanes and severe weather to try to lessen it.
[02:07:20.822 --> 02:07:25.766]  And you were telling us that you had actually, about a year ago, talked to Kay Bailey about this.
[02:07:26.147 --> 02:07:26.407]  Oh, yes.
[02:07:27.136 --> 02:07:30.258]  Yes, and in fact, I talked to her office within the last 10 days.
[02:07:32.059 --> 02:07:33.840]  And her office didn't even mention this to you?
[02:07:33.860 --> 02:07:35.421]  No, it didn't even mention it to me.
[02:07:35.861 --> 02:07:38.502]  In fact, she mentioned the fact that there wasn't any money.
[02:07:38.923 --> 02:07:44.546]  The budget was in such bad shape right now that there couldn't possibly be any money for something like this.
[02:07:45.086 --> 02:07:49.529]  Yeah, we can get $200 billion because we won't do something about it, but we can't spend a few million to stop it.
[02:07:49.649 --> 02:07:49.789]  Yeah.
[02:07:52.091 --> 02:07:52.952]  Well, that's bizarre.
[02:07:52.992 --> 02:07:57.075]  I wanted to read you one more thing that I think everybody might be interested in.
[02:07:57.415 --> 02:08:04.081]  I went to visit actually the father of all this weather modification business, Dr. Robert Simpson.
[02:08:04.121 --> 02:08:10.786]  I visited him last October in Washington, and here's a letter he wrote to me.
[02:08:12.407 --> 02:08:13.488]  And his date is September 28, 2004.
[02:08:14.649 --> 02:08:21.555]  And it says down in the body of it, we have suffered some very bitter disappointments
[02:08:22.285 --> 02:08:34.689]  As the tide turned against further modification efforts, not because of science, we still think it's good science, but because of political squabbles which extended to the level of character assassination.
[02:08:36.470 --> 02:08:36.690]  See?
[02:08:37.630 --> 02:08:40.691]  Here's a guy that's telling you why the program has dropped.
[02:08:40.911 --> 02:08:44.372]  So there were squadrons of scientists attacking you guys?
[02:08:44.852 --> 02:08:45.272]  Oh, yeah.
[02:08:47.353 --> 02:08:48.433]  Hmm, I wonder why.
[02:08:49.374 --> 02:08:50.254]  I don't know, but...
[02:08:51.309 --> 02:08:59.696]  Why has weather modification been categorized in the area of conspiracy theories when for anybody that could open up an encyclopedia, it's been well known for 50 years?
[02:09:02.018 --> 02:09:10.625]  There are a few people involved in this, as I see it, who have been in and out of the program since they finished college.
[02:09:11.826 --> 02:09:12.687]  It's their future.
[02:09:13.568 --> 02:09:14.368]  It's their past.
[02:09:15.589 --> 02:09:17.331]  And they don't want anything interrupted.
[02:09:19.901 --> 02:09:25.846]  So as long as they keep all of us outsiders out, they don't have to worry about this sort of thing.
[02:09:28.287 --> 02:09:45.981]  By not having the government exercise its responsibility to protect its citizens from disasters, I'm offering, or our company and the corporate people are offering to accept that responsibility and take it off the government's hands
[02:09:46.587 --> 02:09:48.969]  Because I think we can offer some protection to the citizens.
[02:09:48.989 --> 02:09:49.950]  Well, you've got the pedigree.
[02:09:49.970 --> 02:09:50.950]  You've got the credentials.
[02:09:51.010 --> 02:09:51.611]  You've done it.
[02:09:51.711 --> 02:09:55.394]  I mean, you were the first person to use it in warfare that we know of in Vietnam.
[02:09:55.434 --> 02:09:56.214]  Why don't you tell us?
[02:09:56.234 --> 02:09:58.676]  It's in the news article posted on our website.
[02:09:58.716 --> 02:10:02.319]  But, Doctor, why don't you tell us specifically about the company out there in Midland?
[02:10:04.080 --> 02:10:12.426]  Well, the people I work with are up in Fargo, North Dakota.
[02:10:13.067 --> 02:10:13.367]  Yes, sir.
[02:10:13.807 --> 02:10:13.928]  And...
[02:10:17.435 --> 02:10:22.938]  I was trying to, I want to get the list and name the people that, I can do it anyway.
[02:10:24.879 --> 02:10:32.864]  But we have the top cloud seeding company in the world, Weather Modification Inc., out of Fargo, North Dakota.
[02:10:33.504 --> 02:10:40.708]  They're exceptionally well equipped with both research type aircraft and cloud seeding aircraft, all being the same kind of airframes.
[02:10:41.689 --> 02:10:45.471]  But they, and we do cloud seeding projects all over the world every year.
[02:10:48.141 --> 02:10:54.845]  Another member of our team is Ice Engineering.
[02:10:55.646 --> 02:10:57.607]  They make cloud seeding materials.
[02:10:57.667 --> 02:10:58.748]  That's all they do.
[02:10:58.808 --> 02:11:03.151]  They're up in North Dakota also.
[02:11:04.672 --> 02:11:06.713]  I have Dr. Bill Woodley.
[02:11:07.814 --> 02:11:09.935]  He's an independent meteorologist.
[02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:14.498]  He and I work together in Project Storm Fury on our team.
[02:11:15.163 --> 02:11:29.735]  We have Professor Daniel Rosenfeld, atmospheric physicist from Hebrew University of Israel, and his worldwide recognized specialty is interpreting satellite data, and then myself.
[02:11:30.576 --> 02:11:37.502]  That is the team we have together, and we tried to get something done this past fall, and no luck.
[02:11:40.006 --> 02:11:54.736]  Well, we need to get this word out because next time a hurricane is barreling towards Florida or Texas or Louisiana about to kill hundreds of people or a thousand people and billions of damage, they better get some aircraft out there to weaken these storms.
[02:11:55.757 --> 02:12:04.943]  Well, we tried to advise them that it takes us six weeks to put together a project like this because we have other commitments around the country, around the world.
[02:12:05.444 --> 02:12:06.004]  You know what I mean?
[02:12:06.605 --> 02:12:08.426]  But this is the project we really want to do.
[02:12:09.110 --> 02:12:10.251]  Because it means so much.
[02:12:10.591 --> 02:12:11.412]  I wonder why.
[02:12:11.432 --> 02:12:12.333]  Well, you know what's going to happen?
[02:12:12.393 --> 02:12:16.116]  Our government's not going to allow it because they make a bunch of money off of it and get to hand out favors.
[02:12:16.376 --> 02:12:16.976]  Yeah.
[02:12:17.096 --> 02:12:17.817]  And you know what?
[02:12:17.977 --> 02:12:21.740]  You're going to end up having Japan or China or somebody contract you.
[02:12:21.760 --> 02:12:28.445]  You're going to be able to demonstrate it outside of the control here, and then they're going to have a real problem on their hands.
[02:12:28.505 --> 02:12:31.448]  Yeah, well, we're really expecting this to happen in South Korea next year.
[02:12:32.548 --> 02:12:33.129]  Oh, really?
[02:12:34.970 --> 02:12:38.313]  Let me tell you what I think is happening, what I think will happen.
[02:12:40.047 --> 02:12:55.372]  I believe that the people who contract this sort of thing, NOAA, will enlist the Air Force to put something together and go out and do this for next year.
[02:12:56.272 --> 02:12:59.273]  Then it won't work because it's not a game.
[02:12:59.293 --> 02:13:01.174]  It won't work.
[02:13:01.474 --> 02:13:07.536]  Then they will have all the proof they need to say that we will continue the rest of our 50-year cycle of research.
[02:13:07.981 --> 02:13:10.443]  Because weather modification, as we know it now, doesn't work.
[02:13:11.884 --> 02:13:13.746]  And you say it's not a game.
[02:13:13.766 --> 02:13:14.486]  What do you mean by that?
[02:13:14.506 --> 02:13:17.108]  I mean, we're not playing a game here.
[02:13:17.148 --> 02:13:20.071]  We're trying to save a bunch of bucks and a bunch of lives.
[02:13:21.512 --> 02:13:26.656]  And so they'll send in a bunch of people that aren't trained and just dump it in the middle of nowhere and do nothing?
[02:13:26.856 --> 02:13:27.356]  That's right.
[02:13:27.417 --> 02:13:29.018]  Well, they would be given coordinates.
[02:13:29.966 --> 02:13:33.809]  That's where they drop material and how much, and then they drop them and come home.
[02:13:34.250 --> 02:13:39.534]  They wouldn't do it just off of being in the storm with the sensors at the moment, picking where to hit it.
[02:13:39.594 --> 02:13:44.098]  They would not be seeking out and recognizing qualified targets when they found them.
[02:13:45.639 --> 02:13:48.922]  It's not something you learn overnight or from a textbook.
[02:13:51.144 --> 02:13:51.864]  No, I understand.
[02:13:51.944 --> 02:13:57.309]  Plus, if you've got data two hours before, take off and fly out there, it'll be totally different by then.
[02:13:59.013 --> 02:14:04.876]  The way the military operates is they'll give you the specific coordinates, and it doesn't even matter if the hurricane's not there once you get there.
[02:14:05.077 --> 02:14:14.242]  You see, in our operation, in our method of doing business or conducting these operations, we don't care about any of that stuff.
[02:14:14.682 --> 02:14:15.743]  We have our own instruments.
[02:14:15.763 --> 02:14:17.044]  We know where the island is.
[02:14:17.064 --> 02:14:18.404]  No, I understand.
[02:14:19.565 --> 02:14:24.368]  True flexibility, true operational control.
[02:14:24.408 --> 02:14:25.669]  No, I certainly understand.
[02:14:25.709 --> 02:14:27.670]  And we have airplanes that are...
[02:14:28.163 --> 02:14:34.269]  Our icing will not collect ice because we have full-time de-icing on them, this sort of thing.
[02:14:34.689 --> 02:14:36.951]  So we can go anywhere, do anything that needs to be done.
[02:14:37.311 --> 02:14:39.133]  I want to jam at least one call in here.
[02:14:39.233 --> 02:14:43.096]  Gil in Texas, you're on with our fellow Texan, Ben Livingston.
[02:14:43.137 --> 02:14:43.477]  Go ahead.
[02:14:45.791 --> 02:14:46.091]  Yes.
[02:14:46.171 --> 02:14:47.992]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[02:14:48.192 --> 02:14:50.993]  Mr. Livingston has some very timely information.
[02:14:51.013 --> 02:14:51.893]  You all hear me fine?
[02:14:51.913 --> 02:14:52.614]  Yes, we do.
[02:14:52.654 --> 02:14:53.034]  Go ahead.
[02:14:53.174 --> 02:14:55.995]  I had to evacuate there to Austin, Alex, because of the storm.
[02:14:56.015 --> 02:14:57.236]  I was down there for two weeks.
[02:14:57.296 --> 02:15:02.638]  Unfortunately, I didn't have the time to possibly even come down here on South Lamar and maybe even see you.
[02:15:02.658 --> 02:15:13.202]  Does Dr. Livingston, and I'm not making any pun of his name, think that there was a tornado, a hurricane, Tammy?
[02:15:14.105 --> 02:15:21.472]  And it went up the east coast and is dumping huge amounts of rain in the northeast quadrant of the United States.
[02:15:22.012 --> 02:15:25.215]  Apparently, they're saying it's going to rain there for maybe three or four more days.
[02:15:25.516 --> 02:15:30.580]  Could they modify even plants that produce rain?
[02:15:33.923 --> 02:15:37.727]  We could modify any cloud, practically for any purpose.
[02:15:38.436 --> 02:15:50.962]  However, our particular interest is only in clouds or storms that have more than 100 miles an hour wind because that's the maximum velocity that most of our residences can stand.
[02:15:51.442 --> 02:15:55.264]  But this technology works for any type of formation?
[02:15:58.606 --> 02:16:06.470]  It will only work for energy sails that have vertical velocity and a vertical velocity component.
[02:16:07.119 --> 02:16:08.219]  Can it prevent rain?
[02:16:08.359 --> 02:16:09.259]  Can it cause drought?
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:10.740]  Oh, yes, it can.
[02:16:10.980 --> 02:16:15.861]  It can take a cloud and make it not do anything.
[02:16:16.481 --> 02:16:17.001]  That's right.
[02:16:17.801 --> 02:16:18.241]  All right.
[02:16:18.381 --> 02:16:19.782]  Well, Gil, thanks for the call.
[02:16:20.182 --> 02:16:34.165]  Mr. Livingston, meteorologist, course physicist, ran entire federal programs for weather war and now weather modification for saving the loss of life and property.
[02:16:34.745 --> 02:16:42.011]  We look forward to having you back on, especially when hurricane season heats back up, and I look forward to talking to you in the very near future, sir.
[02:16:42.091 --> 02:16:44.813]  Thank you so much for all the time you've spent with us.
[02:16:44.833 --> 02:16:45.874]  You've got about 30 seconds.
[02:16:45.914 --> 02:16:46.334]  Anything else?
[02:16:46.634 --> 02:16:47.675]  And thank you very much.
[02:16:47.755 --> 02:16:57.223]  No, sir, I've enjoyed it very much, and I hope that we have got some information out to people that will make them start asking questions themselves.
[02:16:57.323 --> 02:17:02.667]  Why are we not at least making an attempt to reduce the damages of hurricanes?
[02:17:04.133 --> 02:17:05.554]  Well, sorry.
[02:17:05.854 --> 02:17:06.495]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:17:06.515 --> 02:17:09.297]  This is a very proactive, should be a proactive business.
[02:17:10.218 --> 02:17:15.783]  It's not something we can wait until the sun comes up and say, let's go out and see the clouds this afternoon and stop a hurricane.
[02:17:16.303 --> 02:17:21.507]  These require planning, and they're very expensive for people like us to put them on.
[02:17:22.288 --> 02:17:25.691]  So we have to have our business plans made pretty well in advance.
[02:17:26.818 --> 02:17:27.539]  Well, it's simple.
[02:17:27.599 --> 02:17:29.421]  I mean, it's like you've got a fire department.
[02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:32.744]  On the coast, you've got a weather control department.
[02:17:32.764 --> 02:17:33.024]  Yes, sir.
[02:17:33.465 --> 02:17:33.845]  All right.
[02:17:34.145 --> 02:17:35.146]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[02:17:35.166 --> 02:17:36.127]  We'll talk to you soon, sir.
[02:17:36.167 --> 02:17:36.648]  Okay, sir.
[02:17:37.008 --> 02:17:37.369]  Take care.
[02:17:37.829 --> 02:17:38.189]  Bye-bye.
[02:17:38.590 --> 02:17:41.373]  Well, that was a mind-blowing interview that we brought you.
[02:17:41.393 --> 02:17:47.519]  We'll be right back with your calls, those that have been holding.
[02:17:47.559 --> 02:17:49.741]  Do you know the truth about breast cancer?
[02:17:49.781 --> 02:17:51.523]  Did you know that the race for the cure is over?
[02:17:52.665 --> 02:18:00.572]  The best kept secret in the country today is that it is now possible to kill cancer without personal suffering, mutilation, and poisoning of your entire system.
[02:18:00.792 --> 02:18:03.434]  Now, it's cancer's turn to die with LaysMed Inc.'
[02:18:03.414 --> 02:18:04.815]  's patented methodology.
[02:18:04.975 --> 02:18:13.122]  Without cutting, bleeding, drugs, or damaging radiation, we can destroy tumors of any size without adverse side effects at a physician's office.
[02:18:13.522 --> 02:18:15.164]  Star Wars technology at its best.
[02:18:15.524 --> 02:18:16.825]  For more information, call 702-953-0267.
[02:18:16.965 --> 02:18:17.285]  That's 702-953-0267.

[02:18:45.271 --> 02:18:55.998]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[02:18:56.198 --> 02:19:03.663]  The revolutionary Berkey Light with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[02:19:04.003 --> 02:19:04.584]  We're good to go.
[02:19:19.967 --> 02:19:23.870]  The Berkey light is transparent, so there is no guesswork when refilling the system.
[02:19:23.910 --> 02:19:25.811]  The water level is always visible.
[02:19:25.971 --> 02:19:31.935]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[02:19:32.175 --> 02:19:36.118]  Get the Berkey light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:19:45.316 --> 02:19:45.757]  Gold.
[02:19:46.097 --> 02:19:47.378]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[02:19:47.638 --> 02:19:53.724]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[02:19:53.904 --> 02:19:57.748]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[02:19:58.088 --> 02:19:59.970]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[02:20:00.030 --> 02:20:02.332]  Mint, demand is at an all-time high.
[02:20:02.472 --> 02:20:08.938]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weak
[02:20:09.138 --> 02:20:09.619]  We're good to go.
[02:20:24.275 --> 02:20:26.737]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[02:20:26.797 --> 02:20:27.817]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[02:20:46.207 --> 02:20:49.668]  Government is best, which governs the... Wake up and smell the fascism.
[02:20:50.108 --> 02:20:52.748]  Being in government means never having to say you're sorry.
[02:20:53.268 --> 02:20:55.909]  What part of unconstitutional do you not understand, George?
[02:20:56.349 --> 02:21:02.810]  In today's world full of tyranny and injustice, sometimes it seems the only thing we still have is our freedom of speech.

[02:21:25.265 --> 02:21:25.625]  Have you?
[02:21:26.206 --> 02:21:27.727]  Real conservatives hate Bush.
[02:21:28.168 --> 02:21:29.709]  Go to LibertyStickers.com or call 877-873-9626.
[02:21:29.729 --> 02:21:31.210]  If only our president would listen to his God.

[02:21:47.674 --> 02:21:53.699]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:21:54.299 --> 02:21:57.262]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:22:00.524 --> 02:22:03.625]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:22:03.645 --> 02:22:06.127]  We're going to go to Sheila, Fred, Pat, and others.
[02:22:06.907 --> 02:22:08.888]  I do want to get into this martial law news.
[02:22:11.149 --> 02:22:19.432]  Physicist and meteorologist Ben Livingston is a great guy, and he really is the father of a lot of the classical weather modification.
[02:22:20.013 --> 02:22:25.355]  And the point is that, sure, there's ionization, and there's these PARP systems and all that, but
[02:22:25.945 --> 02:22:29.287]  The government can debate and abscond and claim it's the Risky's all day.
[02:22:29.827 --> 02:22:39.012]  We know with 50-year-old technology they can substantively dump the water, 25% reduction that will save masses of lives, and the wind speeds, 25%.
[02:22:39.632 --> 02:22:43.634]  And that's a 1960 test with chicken feed amounts of chemical.
[02:22:45.215 --> 02:22:45.955]  So they know.
[02:22:46.035 --> 02:22:48.176]  This is documented, okay?
[02:22:48.956 --> 02:22:49.937]  And they're not going to do a thing.
[02:22:50.925 --> 02:22:51.506]  And you heard him.
[02:22:51.846 --> 02:22:56.010]  You heard him, because they want to make a bunch of money and hand out a bunch of pork barrel.
[02:22:56.770 --> 02:22:59.933]  And it is sick, sick, sick, sick, sick.
[02:23:01.174 --> 02:23:05.418]  And he keeps wondering why they ignored their programs and ignored it when he headed up the program.
[02:23:05.899 --> 02:23:09.462]  It's because, folks, they don't want people even knowing about weather modification.
[02:23:10.126 --> 02:23:19.432]  They don't want you knowing, so when we get hit by attacks they're sending at us to control populations, to push martial law, that we don't stand up and go, wait a minute, you can control that.
[02:23:19.912 --> 02:23:21.673]  They just want it out of sight, out of mind.
[02:23:21.693 --> 02:23:23.815]  And he even said that they don't want us even knowing it exists.
[02:23:25.916 --> 02:23:26.696]  This is incredible.
[02:23:26.897 --> 02:23:28.518]  Sheila in Oregon, you're on the air.
[02:23:28.618 --> 02:23:29.958]  Thanks for holding for an eon.
[02:23:30.839 --> 02:23:31.960]  Not a problem, Alex.
[02:23:32.140 --> 02:23:33.981]  It's been three years since I talked to you.
[02:23:34.628 --> 02:23:36.009]  And you said you wanted new callers.
[02:23:36.069 --> 02:23:37.369]  I figured I was close enough.
[02:23:37.429 --> 02:23:38.229]  Well, you're a sweetheart.
[02:23:38.269 --> 02:23:39.010]  What's on your mind?
[02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:43.071]  Just wanted to let you know how much I've appreciated your videos.
[02:23:43.571 --> 02:23:47.853]  I've made over 600 DVDs of your work, Dr. Stan's work.
[02:23:48.413 --> 02:23:52.895]  Loose Change is one of the best videos to hand out to people who don't know anything.
[02:23:52.915 --> 02:23:53.935]  Yeah, it's a good video.
[02:23:54.415 --> 02:23:55.296]  It's excellent.
[02:23:55.316 --> 02:23:57.797]  We actually have that at prisonplanet.tv for members.
[02:23:57.837 --> 02:23:59.837]  They were gracious enough to let us post it.
[02:24:00.478 --> 02:24:01.658]  Oh, that's wonderful.
[02:24:02.118 --> 02:24:03.799]  I do have a subscription to it.
[02:24:04.238 --> 02:24:09.459]  You're Prison Planet TV, but I have really slow up speeds, so I can't watch anything on there.
[02:24:10.100 --> 02:24:12.820]  But you do get the e-books and the audio files, right?
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:13.780]  Uh-huh.
[02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:15.501]  But you're saying you have a bad connection?
[02:24:15.841 --> 02:24:16.061]  Right.
[02:24:16.861 --> 02:24:17.922]  Good.
[02:24:17.982 --> 02:24:19.382]  And by good, I'm glad it's not us.
[02:24:20.062 --> 02:24:21.502]  No, it's not you guys at all.
[02:24:22.003 --> 02:24:25.243]  But I just want to let you know that there's other people.
[02:24:25.383 --> 02:24:26.844]  I'm clear out here on the left coast.
[02:24:26.884 --> 02:24:27.904]  I'm in Florence, Oregon.
[02:24:28.624 --> 02:24:31.145]  And as I said, up and down the coast, I've handed out
[02:24:31.650 --> 02:24:35.433]  Over 600 DVDs and 200 videos in the last three years.
[02:24:37.135 --> 02:24:38.796]  People like you saving this country.
[02:24:39.076 --> 02:24:39.777]  We're trying.
[02:24:40.597 --> 02:24:42.399]  Most people don't want to wake up, though.
[02:24:42.419 --> 02:24:43.019]  They don't care.
[02:24:43.200 --> 02:24:48.083]  What do you think about the open discussions now of total martial law and total dictatorship?
[02:24:48.104 --> 02:24:49.585]  I mean, it's openly being discussed.
[02:24:50.966 --> 02:24:53.688]  It just blows my mind, and I can't get people to talk about it.
[02:24:54.168 --> 02:24:56.510]  Well, see, they have to announce it now to normalize it.
[02:24:56.570 --> 02:24:57.351]  Oh, sure!
[02:24:57.371 --> 02:24:59.413]  They've said he'd be the supreme ruler!
[02:25:00.302 --> 02:25:03.884]  I mean, Ron Paul comes on and says Bush is preparing to be Supreme Ruler.
[02:25:03.944 --> 02:25:06.785]  I mean, it's actually happening to the USA.
[02:25:07.606 --> 02:25:07.946]  I know.
[02:25:08.566 --> 02:25:10.827]  It's unbelievable, but it is happening.
[02:25:11.107 --> 02:25:14.489]  But my wake-up call was because they tried to force drug me in 2000.
[02:25:15.109 --> 02:25:18.091]  It's like, whoa, this is insane.
[02:25:18.111 --> 02:25:20.812]  These people are insane.
[02:25:20.852 --> 02:25:24.834]  Well, they're criminals, and their business is enslaving us one way or the other.
[02:25:25.697 --> 02:25:27.038]  But they're sociopaths.
[02:25:27.498 --> 02:25:27.858]  They are.
[02:25:27.898 --> 02:25:29.238]  Well, look, their holiday's over.
[02:25:29.338 --> 02:25:30.339]  We're not your property.
[02:25:30.359 --> 02:25:31.259]  We're not your slaves.
[02:25:31.519 --> 02:25:32.640]  We're not going to lick your boots.
[02:25:32.800 --> 02:25:33.580]  The party's over.
[02:25:34.140 --> 02:25:34.780]  Absolutely.
[02:25:34.861 --> 02:25:37.201]  The party's over, you disgusting parasites.
[02:25:37.622 --> 02:25:39.342]  You cockroaches on two legs.
[02:25:40.263 --> 02:25:44.144]  Now, have you ever had Dr. Len Horowitz on your program?
[02:25:44.164 --> 02:25:45.665]  Yeah, it's funny you mention him.
[02:25:45.705 --> 02:25:48.306]  I heard him on with Jack McClam yesterday.
[02:25:48.666 --> 02:25:49.926]  We've got to get Lenny on.
[02:25:49.986 --> 02:25:50.787]  He's a great guy.
[02:25:50.947 --> 02:25:51.447]  Oh, he is.
[02:25:51.467 --> 02:25:54.208]  I've had him on scores of times, but not in a couple of years.
[02:25:54.642 --> 02:25:59.225]  Yeah, I was going to say I hadn't heard you, but I don't listen to you every day because I do have other things to do.
[02:25:59.265 --> 02:26:00.426]  Hey, I don't blame you.
[02:26:00.446 --> 02:26:02.728]  We're always on at night, too, 9 to midnight.
[02:26:03.008 --> 02:26:03.228]  I know.
[02:26:04.249 --> 02:26:09.013]  And I do try and catch the repeats, and I usually listen to the Power Hour every morning.
[02:26:09.293 --> 02:26:10.134]  Well, that's good.
[02:26:10.954 --> 02:26:12.315]  But then it's time to get going.
[02:26:12.896 --> 02:26:13.936]  I understand, yeah.
[02:26:14.477 --> 02:26:17.179]  That's got to be really early in the morning for you over there, like 5 a.m.
[02:26:17.219 --> 02:26:17.499]  or so.
[02:26:17.659 --> 02:26:23.403]  Yeah, from 5 until 8, I listen to them, and then Gary Brownfield comes on and...
[02:26:24.724 --> 02:26:25.785]  By then I'm usually gone.
[02:26:25.925 --> 02:26:26.785]  You're out the door.
[02:26:27.866 --> 02:26:30.007]  Out trying to do something, saying, wake up people.
[02:26:30.067 --> 02:26:36.090]  I opened up a truth booth at the local vegetable stand and handed out Health Crusader magazine.
[02:26:36.250 --> 02:26:37.510]  We need to force drug you.
[02:26:37.530 --> 02:26:38.131]  You're crazy.
[02:26:38.231 --> 02:26:40.292]  You don't like martial law.
[02:26:40.732 --> 02:26:42.913]  You'll feel much better once you're on these drugs.
[02:26:43.593 --> 02:26:44.954]  You don't want to give all your freedom up?
[02:26:44.974 --> 02:26:46.155]  You're insane.
[02:26:46.775 --> 02:26:47.515]  Absolutely.
[02:26:47.676 --> 02:26:50.497]  I didn't even know what all those drugs were about, but whenever they told me that
[02:26:51.115 --> 02:26:54.497]  I was crazy because I had thrown my husband's stuff out the window.
[02:26:54.557 --> 02:26:56.278]  I said, no, I was mad.
[02:26:56.879 --> 02:26:57.439]  Well, no, no, no.
[02:26:57.499 --> 02:26:59.580]  You see, all this normal behavior.
[02:26:59.880 --> 02:27:00.821]  None of us are perfect.
[02:27:00.841 --> 02:27:01.781]  We all get in fights.
[02:27:01.822 --> 02:27:02.702]  We all have problems.
[02:27:02.962 --> 02:27:04.963]  But you screw up in one little way now.
[02:27:05.244 --> 02:27:07.545]  They want to suck you under their mafia control.
[02:27:07.785 --> 02:27:12.208]  Meanwhile, the government's statistically more criminal, more abusive, more out of control.
[02:27:12.248 --> 02:27:17.471]  But when they make mistakes on purpose, by desire, so how dare you?
[02:27:17.831 --> 02:27:19.692]  Government's your lord.
[02:27:19.732 --> 02:27:20.393]  Thanks for the call.
[02:27:20.913 --> 02:27:21.593]  Thank you.
[02:27:21.613 --> 02:27:21.873]  You bet.
[02:27:21.893 --> 02:27:22.614]  Good to hear from you.
[02:27:22.834 --> 02:27:24.034]  Like, look, it's really that simple.
[02:27:25.135 --> 02:27:28.336]  Government is not your owner.
[02:27:29.417 --> 02:27:33.018]  They are fallible and they are pieces of trash.
[02:27:35.699 --> 02:27:36.620]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.080 --> 02:27:38.680]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.601 --> 02:27:42.282]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.764 --> 02:27:47.345]  We're good to go.
[02:28:01.886 --> 02:28:02.266]  We're good to go.
[02:28:26.134 --> 02:28:29.378]  That's The Nationalist Times, P.O.
[02:28:29.418 --> 02:28:32.021]  Box 426, Allison Park, Pennsylvania, 15101.
[02:28:32.181 --> 02:28:33.983]  Or subscribe online at our website, www.anu.org.
[02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:47.241]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.381 --> 02:28:51.482]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.622 --> 02:28:54.503]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.583 --> 02:29:01.245]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.465 --> 02:29:04.468]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:04.688 --> 02:29:07.071]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.211 --> 02:29:17.201]  Like murky elements, not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as atrazine, benzene, chloride and chloroform.
[02:29:17.261 --> 02:29:20.042]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:29:45.922 --> 02:29:48.384]  Sometimes getting older can be a real pain in the back.
[02:29:48.764 --> 02:29:53.787]  Lower back aches, sciatic nerve pain, or that knife in the back feeling is something many of us have learned to suffer through.
[02:29:53.908 --> 02:29:55.268]  But now, we don't have to.
[02:29:55.288 --> 02:30:03.734]  This sacral wedgie uses the same principle used by chiropractors and osteopaths to correct the alignment of the spine by supporting the sacrum and letting gravity do the rest.
[02:30:04.074 --> 02:30:08.077]  Simply lie on your back with the sacral wedgie under your sacrum and relax for about 20 minutes.
[02:30:08.357 --> 02:30:11.119]  You can actually feel many of these aches and pains just go away.
[02:30:11.519 --> 02:30:15.042]  Use the sacral wedgie regularly and many of these problems just don't come back.
[02:30:15.462 --> 02:30:19.124]  Get your sacral wedgie today for only $29.95 plus shipping and handling.
[02:30:19.384 --> 02:30:20.264]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:21.885 --> 02:30:25.547]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:30:25.787 --> 02:30:28.669]  And ask about the neck support for perfect spinal alignment too.
[02:30:29.049 --> 02:30:31.370]  Yeah, getting old is a pain, but it doesn't have to hurt.
[02:30:31.670 --> 02:30:34.972]  Get your sacral wedgie today and specify whether it's for a man or a woman.
[02:30:35.272 --> 02:30:35.512]  Call 877-817-9829.
[02:30:35.532 --> 02:30:35.852]  That's 877-817-9829.
[02:30:35.872 --> 02:30:36.773]  And give yourself a wedgie.
[02:30:46.229 --> 02:30:48.950]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:30:48.970 --> 02:30:52.851]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:55.172 --> 02:31:06.695]  We're going to go back to your calls, but before we do that, it's really simple.
[02:31:06.815 --> 02:31:12.296]  We're in an information war, and we need soldiers in that war.
[02:31:12.916 --> 02:31:14.817]  Like the last lady, Sheila, in Oregon.
[02:31:16.471 --> 02:31:24.716]  To engage the enemy in the information war, and that's exactly what my award-winning, powerfully produced documentary films do.
[02:31:25.277 --> 02:31:26.858]  Highly proofed, highly documented.
[02:31:27.978 --> 02:31:29.559]  And the videos are getting better and better.
[02:31:29.599 --> 02:31:32.601]  I mean, the new one, Martial Law, is my best work ever.
[02:31:32.641 --> 02:31:33.822]  It is three films in one.
[02:31:34.657 --> 02:31:40.402]  The latest info on the inside job of 9-11, Building 7, how the globalists pulled it off, everything.
[02:31:40.702 --> 02:31:45.206]  The latest police state developments and who the globalists are, what their master plan is.
[02:31:45.286 --> 02:31:53.212]  It is three films in one, $25.95, get a second copy for $19.95, third copy for $16, fourth copy for $14.
[02:31:54.613 --> 02:31:55.634]  I just want you to get them.
[02:31:55.674 --> 02:31:59.377]  Get one copy of American Dictators, and each additional copy is $5.95.
[02:31:59.557 --> 02:32:04.041]  I mean, buy four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten videos.
[02:32:04.972 --> 02:32:06.413]  Give them to your friends and family.
[02:32:06.453 --> 02:32:08.014]  Give them as gifts this holiday season.
[02:32:08.034 --> 02:32:18.862]  Instead of a fruitcake nobody's going to eat or a tie nobody's going to wear, give them the gift of information, a high-quality film, or buy one copy and make copies and give those as gifts.
[02:32:18.902 --> 02:32:28.548]  Those folks probably would appreciate the original with the nice color cover on the DVD or the VHS and the nice color packaging with the shrink wrap and all that, but it doesn't matter.
[02:32:28.868 --> 02:32:32.431]  Or get some of the books we carry or the book I've written or Paul Watson's book.
[02:32:34.059 --> 02:32:37.040]  And yes, when you support us, we can do even more.
[02:32:37.081 --> 02:32:42.683]  Get better computers, better cameras, hire more people to put up more websites and do a better job.
[02:32:44.264 --> 02:32:45.945]  We need your support.
[02:32:47.806 --> 02:32:49.927]  But that's secondary.
[02:32:50.207 --> 02:32:51.647]  You need to get these videos.
[02:32:51.728 --> 02:32:52.508]  Big discounts.
[02:32:52.588 --> 02:33:00.272]  Go to the safe, secure online shopping cart at Infowars.com or Infowars.net or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:33:02.285 --> 02:33:09.489]  And link through on the secure shopping cart over to our Yahoo shopping cart and order some of these videos and books and be sure and take advantage of some of the specials.
[02:33:09.609 --> 02:33:14.152]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, and that's at 3001 South Lamar.
[02:33:14.172 --> 02:33:17.534]  That's 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:33:26.036 --> 02:33:32.261]  Or last but not least, they can answer all your questions about what the films cover, the synopses of each one, the synopsis.
[02:33:32.982 --> 02:33:37.145]  They can tell you about all the different specials, the other books and videos we carry about other great researchers.
[02:33:37.165 --> 02:33:37.946]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:37.986 --> 02:33:38.266]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:33:38.286 --> 02:33:39.427]  Please take action.
[02:33:52.901 --> 02:33:54.382]  These videos will not be seen.
[02:33:54.422 --> 02:33:56.282]  They will not have an effect unless you get them.
[02:33:56.883 --> 02:33:58.443]  And yes, unless you make copies of them.
[02:33:58.503 --> 02:34:00.204]  And I want to thank those that have done that.
[02:34:00.624 --> 02:34:04.145]  From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank those that have aired them on AXS TV.
[02:34:04.846 --> 02:34:08.647]  If you've aired some of our older films on AXS TV, you've got to get the new ones and air them.
[02:34:09.507 --> 02:34:10.668]  Full authorization to.
[02:34:10.748 --> 02:34:11.628]  Please keep it up.
[02:34:12.248 --> 02:34:18.811]  I know things seem dark right now, but the globalists are moving regardless of what we do, but everybody's waking up.
[02:34:19.582 --> 02:34:21.203]  So let them try martial law.
[02:34:21.223 --> 02:34:23.585]  Let them try to pull something even bigger.
[02:34:23.645 --> 02:34:27.128]  It's going to be rough, but at least we planted the seeds.
[02:34:28.970 --> 02:34:31.071]  At least we can say we didn't lay down to it.
[02:34:31.392 --> 02:34:33.733]  And they got a fight on their hands and they know it.
[02:34:33.753 --> 02:34:38.177]  And this is just a bunch of bravado from a bunch of arrogant bullies.
[02:34:39.398 --> 02:34:48.145]  And then just look, for those of you that I guess have never been in a fist fight or never had any of these life experiences, I remember being 12 years old.
[02:34:49.301 --> 02:34:57.325]  Walking home from school and having five guys get around me that were 16, 17 years old, and they started punching me and beating me up just for fun.
[02:34:58.205 --> 02:35:00.746]  And I tried to fight back a little bit, but I was a sweet little kid.
[02:35:00.766 --> 02:35:02.887]  And I got home, my dad said, well, you're a big wimp.
[02:35:03.827 --> 02:35:06.088]  And the next time you need to fight them.
[02:35:06.148 --> 02:35:07.169]  I know you're not a wimp.
[02:35:08.009 --> 02:35:09.990]  I mean, I know how you are, son.
[02:35:10.030 --> 02:35:16.493]  You can fall off a two-story balcony and not even cry when you break something.
[02:35:17.376 --> 02:35:22.939]  And, you know what, I got aggressive, and a few years later I saw those guys, and I put a couple of them in the hospital.
[02:35:23.359 --> 02:35:26.181]  I'm not really saying that's good, but I put one of them in a coma.
[02:35:27.001 --> 02:35:28.162]  I did that another time, too.
[02:35:29.302 --> 02:35:30.123]  Literally in a coma.
[02:35:31.023 --> 02:35:35.686]  And, you know, so you reap what you sow, and it's just better to fight.
[02:35:36.966 --> 02:35:41.529]  And it got to the point where I got into fighting and thought it was cool, which it isn't.
[02:35:42.580 --> 02:35:43.721]  Then it's like the gunslinger.
[02:35:43.741 --> 02:35:46.383]  Everybody wants to get in a fight with you, especially in the culture in Dallas.
[02:35:46.403 --> 02:35:47.664]  Totally different from the culture in Austin.
[02:35:48.105 --> 02:35:49.005]  I'm not a fighter, folks.
[02:35:49.045 --> 02:35:49.546]  I'm a lover.
[02:35:50.246 --> 02:35:53.809]  But you can also go to the extreme.
[02:35:53.849 --> 02:35:57.332]  You've got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them, know when to walk away, know when to run.
[02:35:57.352 --> 02:35:58.813]  You don't always want to jump into a fight.
[02:35:59.694 --> 02:36:02.076]  But when you've got to defend yourself, you've just got to do it.
[02:36:03.337 --> 02:36:06.700]  And it's simple.
[02:36:07.483 --> 02:36:08.683]  It's really simple.
[02:36:08.723 --> 02:36:11.404]  You're afraid until you finally get in that fight.
[02:36:11.424 --> 02:36:17.405]  That big bully who weighs 240 pounds, you weigh 160 pounds, and he just goes ahead and hauls off and punches you.
[02:36:17.425 --> 02:36:18.325]  Just let it loose.
[02:36:18.905 --> 02:36:19.666]  Just let it loose.
[02:36:19.726 --> 02:36:26.847]  It feels so good once you get past the fear and just start knocking their teeth out and blocking their eyes and pounding their head in the pavement.
[02:36:27.747 --> 02:36:30.028]  And of course, that's an analogy of fighting the New World Order.
[02:36:30.068 --> 02:36:31.288]  I'm not scared of these people.
[02:36:32.276 --> 02:36:33.177]  I'm not scared of them.
[02:36:33.197 --> 02:36:34.419]  I'm not going to hit them first.
[02:36:34.479 --> 02:36:45.314]  But if they're stupid enough to haul off and really punch us, which they're getting ready to do, they're going to have millions of veterans, millions of Vietnam vets, and millions of Gulf War I vets, and people I know.
[02:36:45.414 --> 02:36:46.596]  I mean, just so many of them.
[02:36:47.677 --> 02:36:48.258]  It's like the...
[02:36:50.541 --> 02:36:52.042]  It's like an ocean of grass.
[02:36:52.242 --> 02:36:54.063]  I mean, just every person's a blade of grass.
[02:36:54.103 --> 02:37:03.947]  I mean, we have got so much power, and we've had so much restraint, and we've sat here and we've put up with this bull for so long, and it's simple.
[02:37:04.107 --> 02:37:16.492]  You know, that bully's sitting there punching on us and sitting on us and spitting on us and laughing at us and grabbing us and holding us up, and one of them's holding us while the other holds our legs, and they're just punching us, having fun.
[02:37:18.539 --> 02:37:24.062]  Whereas, you know, in real life when those bullies come up and get around you, you just go berserk and start savagely attacking them.
[02:37:24.282 --> 02:37:27.164]  They're not going to like it because bullies are cowards, folks.
[02:37:28.164 --> 02:37:29.445]  Bullies are pieces of filth.
[02:37:31.206 --> 02:37:35.428]  Look, a man in the wrong cannot keep a coming against a man who's in the right.
[02:37:37.389 --> 02:37:38.609]  Or what's the exact saying?
[02:37:38.629 --> 02:37:39.790]  Somebody gave me a plaque of it.
[02:37:39.810 --> 02:37:40.851]  It's an old Texas Ranger saying.
[02:37:40.911 --> 02:37:41.751]  I keep trying to get it right.
[02:37:42.632 --> 02:37:43.532]  What's the exact quote?
[02:37:47.042 --> 02:37:51.184]  Is it a man of the wrong can't stand against a man in the right who keeps on coming?
[02:37:52.145 --> 02:37:56.427]  The point is that goodness is stronger than darkness.
[02:37:57.608 --> 02:37:58.949]  Love is stronger than hate.
[02:38:04.692 --> 02:38:05.972]  We shouldn't be so afraid.
[02:38:05.992 --> 02:38:06.893]  We're all going to die.
[02:38:06.953 --> 02:38:07.593]  Life's short.
[02:38:07.853 --> 02:38:08.934]  We might as well be men.
[02:38:08.994 --> 02:38:10.435]  We might as well not be afraid.
[02:38:10.455 --> 02:38:14.957]  We might as well just get over it and defend the homeland against the New World Order.
[02:38:15.945 --> 02:38:18.286]  And they're so arrogant, they think they're going to get away.
[02:38:18.366 --> 02:38:19.067]  It's an illusion.
[02:38:19.107 --> 02:38:20.587]  They think they're going to get away with all of it.
[02:38:21.068 --> 02:38:23.529]  And that is just not the case.
[02:38:24.730 --> 02:38:25.930]  That is not the case.
[02:38:26.511 --> 02:38:27.971]  They are not going to get away with it.
[02:38:27.991 --> 02:38:29.252]  They never get away with it.
[02:38:30.193 --> 02:38:31.053]  They're not history.
[02:38:32.634 --> 02:38:36.956]  And I'm calling for good police and good FBI and good military and good people everywhere.
[02:38:37.356 --> 02:38:38.757]  We are the real America.
[02:38:38.997 --> 02:38:42.419]  These parasites running our government are the false America.
[02:38:42.679 --> 02:38:44.080]  They're hijackers.
[02:38:45.754 --> 02:39:01.143]  They've literally hijacked things, and now they're telling us America's bad, or that the old America's bad, and that their new America of the black mask and the submachine gun and the jackboot and the surveillance camera is good.
[02:39:01.803 --> 02:39:05.745]  The new America of the open borders and abortion and gun control.
[02:39:05.885 --> 02:39:06.266]  And it isn't.
[02:39:08.490 --> 02:39:10.711]  So people need to get their allegiances straight.
[02:39:10.731 --> 02:39:14.133]  There is no longer any doubting and any debating and any questioning.
[02:39:14.273 --> 02:39:18.775]  We have a corrupt, out-of-control, psychopathic, delusional government.
[02:39:18.815 --> 02:39:20.936]  I mean, Ron Paul said it two days ago.
[02:39:21.016 --> 02:39:24.657]  I mean, they really want military dictatorship, and they want your guns.
[02:39:25.418 --> 02:39:26.478]  And I'd say elaborate.
[02:39:26.638 --> 02:39:27.959]  I've seen them try and take our guns.
[02:39:27.999 --> 02:39:29.220]  And Ron Paul's like, that's right.
[02:39:29.260 --> 02:39:30.560]  They are coming to get our guns.
[02:39:30.820 --> 02:39:32.081]  They're coming to put us in camps.
[02:39:32.501 --> 02:39:34.302]  I mean, folks, this is not a joke.
[02:39:36.798 --> 02:39:40.541]  And a lot of you, you know, the bully's pathetic, but really what's pathetic is the coward.
[02:39:40.861 --> 02:39:49.828]  The cowardly cop or the cowardly sergeant or the cowardly general who knows all this is wrong, but they're going to go ahead and follow orders because they're afraid of peer pressure.
[02:39:50.188 --> 02:39:53.651]  You are the lowest form of rat droppings.
[02:39:53.911 --> 02:39:54.952]  I'm sorry to use that term.
[02:39:54.972 --> 02:39:55.852]  That's all I can say.
[02:39:56.193 --> 02:39:59.795]  You are the lowest form of cockroach I can imagine.
[02:39:59.815 --> 02:40:01.617]  I mean, listen to me.
[02:40:02.894 --> 02:40:04.234]  Do you know why we're America?
[02:40:04.294 --> 02:40:08.836]  Because we had forefathers that were willing to get down and nerdy and spill their guts for freedom.
[02:40:11.676 --> 02:40:13.457]  I mean, blood built this place.
[02:40:13.497 --> 02:40:14.577]  I hope you realize that.
[02:40:15.458 --> 02:40:18.198]  Look, I can't hold a candle to our founding fathers, and you can't.
[02:40:18.518 --> 02:40:20.519]  But the least we can do is try to be men.
[02:40:21.283 --> 02:40:24.865]  The least we can do is not sit there and beg to be slaves.
[02:40:25.305 --> 02:40:38.752]  I am not your slave, and I will never be your slave, and you will never, never get control of me, no matter what you do, no matter what prison camp you put me in, no matter how many electrodes you hook up to me, no matter how many teeth you knock out.
[02:40:39.212 --> 02:40:42.474]  I have always been more of a man than you are, and I always will be.
[02:40:42.734 --> 02:40:44.575]  You are the lowest filth on earth.
[02:40:47.839 --> 02:40:49.181]  And there aren't that many of them either.
[02:40:49.201 --> 02:40:58.070]  They've got a lot of well-meaning dupes and cowards that work for them and a lot of do-gooders and fools and compartmentalized idiots who just can't believe the evil of what they're part of.
[02:40:58.591 --> 02:40:59.812]  They're fast at waking up.
[02:41:00.052 --> 02:41:07.220]  They've got a cadre of psychopath control freaks that were abused as children and like to do this business.
[02:41:07.876 --> 02:41:08.937]  But it isn't going to work.
[02:41:08.997 --> 02:41:14.803]  Okay, we outnumber them thousands and thousands and thousands to one, and it's time for us to stop being bullied.
[02:41:15.203 --> 02:41:18.687]  It's time when the punks punch us in the face to punch them right back.
[02:41:18.947 --> 02:41:20.969]  And when they hit the ground, stomp their head.
[02:41:20.989 --> 02:41:25.073]  Now, I mean that figuratively.
[02:41:25.414 --> 02:41:27.756]  Whenever comes a push, comes a shove, I mean literally.
[02:41:28.236 --> 02:41:28.817]  Stomp them.
[02:41:29.438 --> 02:41:31.660]  When they're down, don't let them get back up.
[02:41:32.375 --> 02:41:42.782]  You think when I was in a fight and I had two big old 240 pound black guys pounding on me in some back alley, you think when I got one of them down I just gave up?
[02:41:43.063 --> 02:41:43.803]  I just quit?
[02:41:44.584 --> 02:41:46.305]  That's how you get killed in a fight.
[02:41:47.165 --> 02:41:49.147]  That's when you start kicking them in the head.
[02:41:50.288 --> 02:41:59.254]  You think when I had two big old, or three big old rednecks, one of them swinging a pair of post hole diggers in my head that I gave up once I got one of them down?
[02:42:00.242 --> 02:42:02.524]  This is going for broke, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:42:02.724 --> 02:42:06.788]  This is 110% total warfare for the species.
[02:42:07.628 --> 02:42:09.690]  So I use the analogy of a street fight.
[02:42:10.411 --> 02:42:13.693]  I use the analogy of a street fight for the fight against the New World Order.
[02:42:13.954 --> 02:42:16.315]  This is no holds barred.
[02:42:16.676 --> 02:42:22.601]  Mortal combat for your family, this society, this entire civilization.
[02:42:25.463 --> 02:42:26.384]  Do you understand that?
[02:42:28.041 --> 02:42:28.982]  This isn't a joke.
[02:42:29.022 --> 02:42:30.102]  This isn't a game.
[02:42:30.843 --> 02:42:32.364]  This is the real world.
[02:42:32.904 --> 02:42:34.626]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:42:35.666 --> 02:42:37.888]  Let's go ahead and talk to Fred in Illinois.
[02:42:37.908 --> 02:42:38.688]  Go ahead, Fred.
[02:42:38.708 --> 02:42:39.429]  Hi, Alex.
[02:42:39.469 --> 02:42:39.869]  Can you hear me?
[02:42:40.129 --> 02:42:40.410]  Yes.
[02:42:40.890 --> 02:42:41.470]  Fantastic.
[02:42:41.530 --> 02:42:43.532]  I just wanted to let you know I'm 21 years old.
[02:42:43.852 --> 02:42:51.417]  I was brought up to believe that the Second Amendment was an outdated law that they needed 200 years ago when people had wooden teeth.
[02:42:51.877 --> 02:42:53.659]  And I believed this for so many years.
[02:42:53.759 --> 02:42:55.400]  And I got into Michael Moore's crap and
[02:42:56.359 --> 02:43:00.642]  I suddenly realized what a socialist he is, and I got into your stuff a little bit.
[02:43:01.202 --> 02:43:07.125]  And then the more and more I watched it, the more excited I got because I realized that we can fight, that we can win.
[02:43:07.246 --> 02:43:07.706]  Exactly.
[02:43:07.746 --> 02:43:15.190]  The globalists know you're going to rebel against their corrupt system, so they give you a false socialist escape valve that's actually controlled by their paradigm.
[02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:16.171]  Exactly.
[02:43:16.191 --> 02:43:19.092]  And they've tried it before, and we've defeated them before, and we can do it again.
[02:43:19.112 --> 02:43:21.554]  And I just wanted to let you know you've inspired me.
[02:43:22.294 --> 02:43:23.915]  Me and my girlfriend have put up a website.
[02:43:23.935 --> 02:43:25.176]  Can I get the link?
[02:43:25.956 --> 02:43:26.476]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:43:26.856 --> 02:43:29.377]  It's the phoenixsunrise.com, all one word.
[02:43:29.417 --> 02:43:31.617]  That's a nice name, phoenixsunrise.com.
[02:43:32.077 --> 02:43:32.357]  Thank you.
[02:43:33.177 --> 02:43:37.798]  We got, you know, Northwood, all the documents that you've professed, they're all on there, they're all real.
[02:43:38.318 --> 02:43:40.479]  And I wanted to let you know we really wanted to support you.
[02:43:41.799 --> 02:43:43.239]  We're broke and we have a child.
[02:43:44.019 --> 02:43:47.260]  We wanted to send you like... But I don't want you to support, I don't need your support, sir.
[02:43:47.540 --> 02:43:48.180]  No, no, no, no.
[02:43:48.640 --> 02:43:50.240]  No, it is necessary.
[02:43:50.481 --> 02:43:52.321]  And we signed up for prisonplanet.tv.
[02:43:53.819 --> 02:43:56.020]  $5.95.
[02:43:53.999 --> 02:43:56.020]  I mean, it's not going to break us, don't worry.
[02:43:56.741 --> 02:43:58.361]  And it is just, it is so worth it.
[02:43:58.521 --> 02:44:00.262]  It is just a library of information.
[02:44:00.282 --> 02:44:02.183]  Anything that you need is at your fingertips.
[02:44:02.263 --> 02:44:02.903]  It's no joke.
[02:44:03.023 --> 02:44:04.924]  Fast downloading speeds, everything you want.
[02:44:05.505 --> 02:44:06.505]  And I just wanted to thank you.
[02:44:06.765 --> 02:44:08.046]  Thank you for fighting the war.
[02:44:08.246 --> 02:44:09.887]  Well, I appreciate that, Fred.
[02:44:10.787 --> 02:44:11.888]  Oh, one more thing.
[02:44:11.908 --> 02:44:14.609]  Have you heard of Tom Burden?
[02:44:15.389 --> 02:44:15.949]  Tom who?
[02:44:16.250 --> 02:44:16.610]  Burden.
[02:44:16.970 --> 02:44:19.191]  He was a lieutenant colonel for the U.S.,
[02:44:20.051 --> 02:44:25.113]  Yeah, I did a lot of experiments involving nuclear energy back in 1962.
[02:44:25.153 --> 02:44:30.955]  Yeah, it rings a bell back in the back of my head, but I don't remember how I don't.
[02:44:30.975 --> 02:44:38.938]  Okay, well, I got an interview from 1985 where he talks about how the Russians were using electromagnetic waves to influence weather control.
[02:44:39.751 --> 02:44:44.534]  And, you know, he didn't come out for 20 years and didn't say anything about it, and now he's got a few books out about it.
[02:44:44.795 --> 02:44:46.135]  Well, I ought to interview him.
[02:44:46.155 --> 02:44:51.539]  You've got to send any recommendations to tips at InfoWars.com and take care of my friend.
[02:44:52.360 --> 02:44:53.680]  And let me be clear about this.
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:44:59.244]  You know, if you're broke and you don't have any money, folks, I don't want you to buy anything from us.
[02:44:59.304 --> 02:45:02.226]  I mean, I'm sure you can find a neighbor who will give you a copy of one of the videos.
[02:45:04.557 --> 02:45:05.037]  We're good to go.
[02:45:25.993 --> 02:45:32.440]  And so, you know, I go off into these memories of, you know, just remembering how it is to get over fear, to turn it loose.
[02:45:32.960 --> 02:45:35.763]  Look, when you're under attack, folks, you've got to turn it loose.
[02:45:36.203 --> 02:45:37.164]  Turn it loose!
[02:45:37.705 --> 02:45:39.527]  And that's what I've done in the fight against the New World Order.
[02:45:39.547 --> 02:45:40.548]  And I haven't done the best job.
[02:45:40.568 --> 02:45:41.088]  It doesn't matter.
[02:45:41.388 --> 02:45:42.209]  I've shown up.
[02:45:42.830 --> 02:45:45.252]  I've shown up, and I've turned myself loose.
[02:45:45.533 --> 02:45:46.754]  I've turned myself loose.
[02:45:47.034 --> 02:45:48.275]  I haven't held myself back.
[02:45:48.315 --> 02:45:49.737]  I've asked God to give me guidance.
[02:45:50.701 --> 02:45:52.843]  And, you know, it's not a good analogy to talk about fighting.
[02:45:52.883 --> 02:45:54.985]  Fighting is not cool, and I'll tell young people not to do it.
[02:45:55.545 --> 02:46:00.969]  I've got a broken leg and broken bones and, you know, all sorts of stuff because I got into it.
[02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:03.131]  And, you know, it's not fun.
[02:46:03.151 --> 02:46:05.613]  I mean, I actually get up in the morning and have aches and pains from it.
[02:46:06.113 --> 02:46:08.435]  So, you know, please don't start shooting my mouth off.
[02:46:08.475 --> 02:46:10.336]  It just sounds ridiculous, and I don't know why I do it.
[02:46:10.376 --> 02:46:11.918]  But, you know, I just say what's on my mind.
[02:46:12.558 --> 02:46:14.700]  And, you know, the analogy is, though...
[02:46:15.512 --> 02:46:17.854]  Well, it's the old football example.
[02:46:17.894 --> 02:46:21.116]  Your coaches will tell you, you've got to go 110% or you're going to get hurt.
[02:46:22.557 --> 02:46:24.359]  You've got to go 110% in life.
[02:46:24.659 --> 02:46:30.163]  It's the one down, the one play, where you don't go 110% when you break your ankle.
[02:46:31.484 --> 02:46:32.865]  And that's how this fight is.
[02:46:33.466 --> 02:46:43.193]  The minute you let fear creep in, the minute you don't go with your intellect integrated with your instincts, the minute you let them get the advantage over you, they've already won.
[02:46:44.051 --> 02:46:44.551]  You have got it.
[02:46:44.571 --> 02:46:45.792]  It's called the initiative.
[02:46:46.572 --> 02:46:47.693]  And we're going to take it to them.
[02:46:47.713 --> 02:46:48.714]  We're going to smash them.
[02:46:50.555 --> 02:46:51.995]  The victory is ours, people.
[02:46:52.035 --> 02:46:52.776]  We've got to take it.
[02:46:53.736 --> 02:46:54.797]  We're going to smash them.
[02:46:55.617 --> 02:46:56.618]  We're coming for you.
[02:46:57.959 --> 02:46:59.279]  Let's talk to Pat in Ohio.
[02:46:59.319 --> 02:46:59.900]  Pat, welcome.
[02:47:01.400 --> 02:47:02.001]  Hello, Alex.
[02:47:02.441 --> 02:47:02.701]  Hi.
[02:47:02.961 --> 02:47:03.281]  Hi.
[02:47:03.542 --> 02:47:04.662]  Yeah, I'm from Columbus.
[02:47:05.383 --> 02:47:07.044]  And I'll keep this short.
[02:47:07.264 --> 02:47:07.384]  It's...
[02:47:08.720 --> 02:47:10.341]  Your videos are very excellent.
[02:47:10.702 --> 02:47:12.663]  I'm getting all these plugs for the videos today.
[02:47:12.703 --> 02:47:13.164]  Thank you.
[02:47:13.384 --> 02:47:15.846]  Yeah, the DVDs.
[02:47:16.987 --> 02:47:17.627]  It's really good.
[02:47:17.668 --> 02:47:19.849]  But my concern is your security.
[02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:25.114]  I've been sharing them, making takes as well, and passing them out to my friends.
[02:47:26.335 --> 02:47:30.138]  But the stuff that's on them makes me wonder about your security.
[02:47:30.598 --> 02:47:31.339]  Can't they hurt you?
[02:47:31.359 --> 02:47:36.063]  Because you know what they did to John Hines and I guess maybe Paul Wellesfield?
[02:47:36.451 --> 02:47:37.692]  They've killed a lot of people.
[02:47:37.792 --> 02:47:39.533]  Yeah, and have they ever threatened you?
[02:47:39.593 --> 02:47:40.073]  Anyone?
[02:47:40.713 --> 02:47:41.294]  Well, yeah.
[02:47:41.994 --> 02:47:43.555]  We can't get away from fighting today.
[02:47:44.015 --> 02:47:46.376]  Yeah, no, it's been a police report about it.
[02:47:46.396 --> 02:47:47.297]  It was caught on tape.
[02:47:47.937 --> 02:47:52.440]  I had four guys pound on me out in the parking lot one time, but they didn't like what happened.
[02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:55.721]  They were surprised.
[02:47:55.741 --> 02:47:57.923]  They were hired, and they said, shut up.
[02:47:58.563 --> 02:48:00.404]  They were there saying, it's time for you to keep your mouth shut.
[02:48:00.444 --> 02:48:05.747]  That was over Waco, because I was really exposing things on Waco and protesting Judge Walter Smith and
[02:48:06.357 --> 02:48:08.398]  They were there to tell me that it was time to shut up.
[02:48:08.458 --> 02:48:13.581]  Of course, I didn't, and then... You know, I've gotten death threats over the telephone and stuff before.
[02:48:13.661 --> 02:48:15.542]  It's just... Yeah, that's what I was wondering.
[02:48:15.582 --> 02:48:17.463]  But, I mean, it's just like out of a movie.
[02:48:18.063 --> 02:48:20.865]  I mean, the voice changes a whole bit, and I just tell them, bring it on.
[02:48:21.545 --> 02:48:22.286]  I mean, you know what?
[02:48:22.666 --> 02:48:22.946]  Listen.
[02:48:23.957 --> 02:48:28.141]  Life's pretty darn tiring and tough, and I enjoy it and I eat it up, but I am not worried about it.
[02:48:28.421 --> 02:48:31.924]  Listen, you can't do what we do and worry about death.
[02:48:31.944 --> 02:48:33.225]  I'm nothing.
[02:48:34.026 --> 02:48:37.048]  People that have actually been in sustained combat, you just turn it off.
[02:48:37.589 --> 02:48:39.430]  You know, I'll tell you what, I'll explain it to you when we get back.
[02:48:39.651 --> 02:48:41.692]  You know, God is in control, folks.
[02:48:42.433 --> 02:48:44.615]  So I fear God a lot more than I fear the New World Order.
[02:48:46.425 --> 02:48:49.286]  There is a secret that holds the world's destiny in its grasp.
[02:48:49.526 --> 02:48:51.127]  Hello, my friends, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:51.447 --> 02:48:56.110]  Learn that secret with my new film, Martial Law, 9-11, Rise of the Police State.
[02:48:56.470 --> 02:49:00.892]  Martial Law plumbs the depths of the New World Order's ideology, their philosophy.
[02:49:01.312 --> 02:49:05.494]  Out of the ashes of the September 11th tragedy, a dark empire of war and tyranny has risen.
[02:49:05.714 --> 02:49:08.557]  The Constitution has been shredded, and America is now a police state.
[02:49:08.657 --> 02:49:13.321]  This film exposes not just who was behind the 9-11 attacks, but the roots and history of its orchestrators.
[02:49:13.521 --> 02:49:17.946]  Martial Law is a blazing spotlight, piercing the electronic Berlin Wall of controlled corporate media.
[02:49:18.166 --> 02:49:25.393]  Plumb the depths of the elite's minds, their ideology, their driving philosophy, and uncover the power-mad cult of death that has sworn to turn the Earth into a prison planet.
[02:49:25.653 --> 02:49:28.075]  Discover the documented truth for yourself before it's too late.
[02:49:28.235 --> 02:49:29.977]  Call toll-free to get a copy of Martial Law.

[02:49:45.732 --> 02:49:50.957]  Nuclear reactors provide economical energy, but would you be prepared during an accident?
[02:49:51.098 --> 02:49:59.186]  During nuclear disasters, great amounts of radioactive iodine are released into the atmosphere, which are then readily absorbed into the body.
[02:49:59.446 --> 02:50:06.493]  Medical Corps' potassium iodate gives you virtually complete protection from the most feared consequence of a nuclear accident.
[02:50:07.433 --> 02:50:13.935]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:14.115 --> 02:50:19.197]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.317 --> 02:50:28.200]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.460 --> 02:50:33.221]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium

[02:50:52.954 --> 02:50:55.195]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[02:51:22.250 --> 02:51:22.930]  We're good to go.
[02:51:48.864 --> 02:51:51.786]  Alright, to answer Pat's question, he's still there.
[02:51:52.067 --> 02:51:55.910]  You have to be willing to give up your life to save your life.
[02:51:57.030 --> 02:52:00.393]  I mean, that's really... That's in the Bible, but it's true.
[02:52:00.413 --> 02:52:03.695]  When you're willing to fight and die for freedom, you're going to have freedom.
[02:52:04.076 --> 02:52:05.517]  Because the tyrants aren't going to move on you.
[02:52:05.537 --> 02:52:11.221]  When you're afraid and try to appease and try to go along to get along, you're going to get more abuse.
[02:52:11.261 --> 02:52:13.002]  See, that's really the anomaly.
[02:52:13.102 --> 02:52:16.225]  People think you grovel, you lay down, you go along to get along...
[02:52:17.293 --> 02:52:18.854]  That everything's honky-dory.
[02:52:18.914 --> 02:52:19.274]  It's not.
[02:52:19.314 --> 02:52:23.037]  That leads into enslavement, into stagnation.
[02:52:24.098 --> 02:52:30.102]  When you're mean, when you're spying, when you're like a porcupine, the wolves leave you alone.
[02:52:30.122 --> 02:52:32.083]  When you're a fat little mouse, they're going to eat you.
[02:52:32.824 --> 02:52:34.405]  They use another ridiculous analogy.
[02:52:36.406 --> 02:52:38.148]  We do what we do because we love.
[02:52:38.168 --> 02:52:41.170]  I love my children, and I'm going to fight.
[02:52:41.190 --> 02:52:42.191]  They're not going to be slaves.
[02:52:42.851 --> 02:52:44.072]  I'm going to fight as best I can.
[02:52:44.950 --> 02:52:46.450]  And I love everybody's children.
[02:52:46.530 --> 02:52:47.451]  I love humanity.
[02:52:47.971 --> 02:52:50.351]  And it's not some, ooh, high and lofty thing.
[02:52:50.411 --> 02:52:51.992]  It's just normal, folks.
[02:52:52.392 --> 02:52:54.152]  This is how you're supposed to operate.
[02:52:54.933 --> 02:52:58.714]  You're supposed to stand up against criminals and scumbags and abusers.
[02:52:59.674 --> 02:53:01.274]  And, no, God's in control.
[02:53:01.314 --> 02:53:02.795]  That's number one why I haven't been killed.
[02:53:02.835 --> 02:53:04.295]  And they tried death-threatening me.
[02:53:05.275 --> 02:53:06.376]  They tried beating me up.
[02:53:07.096 --> 02:53:07.936]  I don't talk a lot about it.
[02:53:07.956 --> 02:53:10.237]  People always ask about it, so I've got to, you know, mention it.
[02:53:11.057 --> 02:53:11.217]  And...
[02:53:12.734 --> 02:53:13.835]  Now, I just laugh at people.
[02:53:14.055 --> 02:53:19.337]  Years ago, I'd get the call with the voice changer, Mr. Jones, it's time for you to stop these activities.
[02:53:20.177 --> 02:53:23.619]  And, you know, I saw the little dog in the backyard.
[02:53:23.639 --> 02:53:25.580]  How was it doing by the fig tree?
[02:53:26.360 --> 02:53:29.682]  And, you know, at a certain point, you just go, look, do whatever you've got to do.
[02:53:30.462 --> 02:53:34.504]  You must be in a living hell to have to act like this and do this for a living.
[02:53:35.264 --> 02:53:36.625]  You know, I bet you're upset at night.
[02:53:36.645 --> 02:53:37.665]  I bet you have nightmares at night.
[02:53:37.705 --> 02:53:38.786]  I bet you're really lonely.
[02:53:39.066 --> 02:53:41.467]  And the more evil you plunge into, the more unhappy you are.
[02:53:42.146 --> 02:53:44.068]  Man, it freaks people like that out.
[02:53:44.788 --> 02:53:52.915]  Some guy with his big muscles and his tattoos and all his whores and his fast car and all the money in his bank account.
[02:53:53.756 --> 02:53:54.857]  And what does it do for him?
[02:53:54.917 --> 02:53:55.197]  Nothing.
[02:53:55.237 --> 02:53:57.018]  He's a little baby who's afraid.
[02:53:57.258 --> 02:53:59.220]  A real man takes care of little people.
[02:53:59.500 --> 02:54:01.482]  A real man stands up for what's good.
[02:54:01.722 --> 02:54:03.964]  A real man doesn't strut around and abuse people.
[02:54:05.931 --> 02:54:12.037]  And so that person then, unless there's a total psychopath, even total psychopaths get freaked out by the truth.
[02:54:12.598 --> 02:54:14.700]  We're stronger than they are.
[02:54:14.740 --> 02:54:17.323]  He that is in us is greater than he that is in the world.
[02:54:17.343 --> 02:54:19.725]  And when we start realizing that, we don't care.
[02:54:19.745 --> 02:54:23.169]  It would be a blessing if the New World Order seized me and killed me.
[02:54:23.189 --> 02:54:24.370]  It would be God's will.
[02:54:25.348 --> 02:54:26.328]  It would be a blessing.
[02:54:26.368 --> 02:54:27.829]  I guarantee you, good would come out of it.
[02:54:29.110 --> 02:54:31.651]  It is all in God's hands, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:54:32.051 --> 02:54:34.031]  And I said, if that happened, it would be in God's will.
[02:54:34.051 --> 02:54:34.672]  It would be a blessing.
[02:54:34.892 --> 02:54:35.872]  I'm not saying it would be a blessing.
[02:54:36.132 --> 02:54:38.133]  If that's what God wants, that's what God wants.
[02:54:38.833 --> 02:54:44.575]  The persecution of the church, of the body of Christ, you can be the preacher, I will, is the strength of it.
[02:54:45.296 --> 02:54:46.896]  You understand that, folks?
[02:54:47.297 --> 02:54:49.537]  That is literally when we get closest to God.
[02:54:51.906 --> 02:54:54.427]  Every day I think, God, please don't make me like Job.
[02:54:54.527 --> 02:54:55.528]  I've been so blessed.
[02:54:56.008 --> 02:54:58.089]  I've been blessed fighting this.
[02:54:58.109 --> 02:55:00.350]  My whole life, I didn't know this, was preparation.
[02:55:00.390 --> 02:55:11.394]  The things I saw, the drug-dealing sheriff, the devil worshippers in the community, the evil I witnessed growing up, all the things I saw was readying me to see the world through the proper lens.
[02:55:12.054 --> 02:55:13.755]  Now, I am ranting and raving, Pat.
[02:55:13.775 --> 02:55:14.736]  Does that answer your question?
[02:55:15.276 --> 02:55:15.516]  Yeah.
[02:55:16.136 --> 02:55:18.017]  I have one more statement.
[02:55:18.597 --> 02:55:18.797]  Sure.
[02:55:20.979 --> 02:55:24.340]  Looking at your tape, I just have a mild criticism.
[02:55:24.380 --> 02:55:26.041]  That's regarding Michael Moore.
[02:55:26.581 --> 02:55:41.848]  I'm just thinking, you know, because he did a good thing with, what is it, Fahrenheit 9-11, and he may not have the same level of, his level of fear may be greater, and maybe he couldn't go as deep like you were asking him about 9-11 issues.
[02:55:41.968 --> 02:55:42.588]  Listen, listen.
[02:55:45.768 --> 02:55:46.689]  He did what he could.
[02:55:46.869 --> 02:55:47.509]  No, I hear you.
[02:55:47.549 --> 02:55:48.149]  We're out of time.
[02:55:48.169 --> 02:55:49.710]  You can call me back later and we can talk about it more.
[02:55:50.451 --> 02:55:52.472]  Actually, Michael Moore did George Bush a favor.
[02:55:53.092 --> 02:55:59.716]  He took the massive 9-11 movement that was talking about government involvement and just made it where Bush is a buffoon.
[02:56:01.176 --> 02:56:05.659]  So he turned capital murder of 3,000 people into just negligence.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:08.340]  Negligent homicide.
[02:56:10.081 --> 02:56:11.322]  And that just won't do it.
[02:56:12.697 --> 02:56:13.157]  Okay.
[02:56:13.258 --> 02:56:16.340]  Plus, I didn't like Michael Moore's bodyguards pushing on me and stuff.
[02:56:16.360 --> 02:56:17.180]  So, you know, yeah.
[02:56:17.661 --> 02:56:19.202]  We might have been a little hard on Michael Moore.
[02:56:19.822 --> 02:56:20.643]  He's a tool.
[02:56:21.123 --> 02:56:21.984]  God bless you all.
[02:56:22.004 --> 02:56:24.506]  Vaya con Dios.
